11 2018-02-01 23:57:56 Shrinking national parks to make room for oil pipelines does not protect trees. Environment protection groups almost unanimously oppose these deregulations. Oil is a dead industry, and Donald wants to drill more, approve dangerous pipelines and mine coal. All dumb ideas.

42 2018-02-01 23:55:54 Sonny...that man smell like Kente oil.
43 2018-02-01 23:55:44 And look ahead to cash flow when they report. Free cash flow has been rising with the rebound in the oil price. Maybe better dividends or buybacks?
44 2018-02-01 23:55:43 Hey @POTUS with all that oil you're authorizing to be drilled why the f*** are the oil prices going up by $0.25
45 2018-02-01 23:55:38 I heard it's the exact opposite. THC just makes you high.
CBD oil helps with my pain and no high.

47 2018-02-01 23:55:22 The earth naturally produces oil, coal and natural gas and you say we are raping the earth by using it, that’s nuts. I say God put it there for us to use.

51 2018-02-01 23:54:48 Notice that in 2015 when Notley's NDP took control of Alberta, GDP started taking a steep nose dive. Given the fact that the energy industry is a big portion of Canada's economy & coupled with an anti-oilsands Gov't in charge. That did far more damage than the low oil prices.

53 2018-02-01 23:54:34 Tempted to drench my pillow in Olbas Oil in attempt to clear my entirely blocked nostrils.
54 2018-02-01 23:54:33 Your pantry & mine are likely very similar. Lots of different legumes, rice varieties, fresh spices, curry paste. Fresh greens, frozen veg what’ll steam & still be ‘al dente’ & bright. Olive oil, vinegars, chili sauces, coconut milk & good noodles, steel cut oats & grits.
55 2018-02-01 23:54:26 If you can use a little bit of coconut oil and swish around spit and rinse that helps
56 2018-02-01 23:53:50 Question is #TeaParty owned by #KochNetwork #ProPutin ? Why? #Oil #GlobalWarming for more access to OIL !  @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
57 2018-02-01 23:53:48 Welp. The cost of getting my oil changed done went up!! 
58 2018-02-01 23:53:44 Questionable life choices only baking brownies with out of date oil.
59 2018-02-01 23:53:26 So now my butt is sitting in Toyota waiting on this oil change and multi point inspection to be finished 
60 2018-02-01 23:53:12 Anecdote: Ordered grilled baccalà in Lucca. I was about to spritz it w/ lemon (provided on the table), when the waiter swooped down & said, "Stop! That's for the tourists!" He doused it w olive oil and ground lots of black pepper over it. Delicious. (Helps to speak some Italian.)
61 2018-02-01 23:52:59 False. The wood thing came and squished the head of that guy in the oil. =blood
62 2018-02-01 23:52:33 Oil change, multi point inspection, vehicle inspection and renewing my vehicle registration  just hit me all at once. I thought I had some “fun” money. Smooth forgot my registration went out 01/18. And I ain’t tryna pay no ticket
63 2018-02-01 23:52:13 highkey idk what’s happening the whole time. what blood there’s oil???
64 2018-02-01 23:52:10 A6: Our on the fly is a black bean, corn, avocado, tomato, cilantro, and lime salsa!!! We also love to lightly grill just about every veggie that will not fall through the grill rack with a light brushing of olive oil!!! #newyearnewyou

68 2018-02-01 23:51:49 NahI'm not worriedWe have got bass straightMajor storage of oil and gasSoBuild a base in Gippsland ok ready supply
69 2018-02-01 23:51:47 As far as the solar industry, I have no clue. It grew exponentially under Obama and Trump has said he prefers coal & oil to renewable sources. Hopefully he doesn't piss away those opportunities, but since he's done absolutely zero for the coal industry, maybe renewables are safe.
70 2018-02-01 23:51:40 i have to get a oil change tomorrow this to much, tisha should’ve took it today when she was out 
71 2018-02-01 23:51:36 Just quit buying their oil,for starter.
72 2018-02-01 23:51:35 I hate waiting. Oil change was supposed to take 30 minutes, here I am still waiting a hour and a half later 
73 2018-02-01 23:51:22 And fill it with oil. When spilled oil is REALLY good for the environment that he is supposed to be protecting. Let's ask the Gulf Coast how they feel about oil spills. What it did to our fishing industry, tourism and our beautiful beaches, and wildlife.
74 2018-02-01 23:51:22 Caster oil and coconut oil mix together and apply ,it worked for me like magic 
75 2018-02-01 23:51:09 Don't.  You've been conned by a pied piper who's never accomplished anything selling socialist snake oil to a bunch of low info kids who don't know history, Bernie's history, or how politics or much of anything else works.
76 2018-02-01 23:51:05 It’s also trampling on your rights if you’re private landowner bordering #oil or #natgas lease site that’s concerned about potential #safety effects on you, your property, or your family.  Now you aren’t guaranteed input on what happens to you/ your #property.  #Trump #publicland
77 2018-02-01 23:50:50 Bae gets an oil change & a bath tomorrow

86 2018-02-01 23:48:54 Well one. Blue plate is divulging & 2, it’s literally oil & eggs. I’m not saying I could do it but I would have chosen mayo over some of the other choices in a heartbeat.
87 2018-02-01 23:48:54 Alright, I took 20 minutes and did a coconut oil mask and then did an argan oil massage on my face.

Feelin' soooo good.

Self care for just a few minutes ain't bad.

90 2018-02-01 23:48:29 .@RubioNM35 there’s a much bigger conversation behind HJM6. I’ve been all over the state and everyone talks about how oil and gas impacts us. #nmleg
91 2018-02-01 23:48:25 gotta change the oil first, that's where a lot of people mess up
92 2018-02-01 23:48:12 But Nah, let's open up their homes to oil drilling. I'm sure that won't make it worse. #TrumpLogic
93 2018-02-01 23:48:08 I think we should build a pipeline to the continental divide at the border. We can offer to complete the pipe, or let 'nature's pipeline' take the oil to the coast for us.

98 2018-02-01 23:47:17 So what's the safety record of the existing KM pipeline? No shit, really good. I'm sure oil by rail is too. #nottrue oh well
99 2018-02-01 23:47:16 My brother (diagnosed with fibro in the 90s) told mom that the only way to deal with fibromyalgia is cannabis and yoga - everything else was snake oil and lies. Also, that a lot of her symptoms are in her head.

101 2018-02-01 23:47:06 I buy oil filters from em
102 2018-02-01 23:47:05 I’m calling they will ruin the coast when they have their first oil spill.
103 2018-02-01 23:46:57 Given FL got an exemption and their oil is:
a) easier to extract
b) more plentiful
c) less risk to the environment (nearly flat beaches in case of spill)
It seems like getting an exemption for CA should be very doable. (Should it not be based on politics).
104 2018-02-01 23:46:54 That’s an oil painting, ma’am, not a photo. 
105 2018-02-01 23:46:54 They keep talking about taking Alberta, but they can't have it. The mountains, cities and oil belongs to all of us, not just the small number of embarrassing dudebros (most of who moved here to reap it's benefits and now feel it belongs to them "cuz they worked in the oil patch")
106 2018-02-01 23:46:45 I bought a gym membership but now I cant afford an oil change

108 2018-02-01 23:46:34 I was very grumpy last night from being so sick and wasn’t very nice this morning and Alex went and got an oil change on our car and vacuumed it  I’m crying because I didn’t deserve it and he takes such good care of me even when I’m a brat 
109 2018-02-01 23:46:22 You know there is a difference between floating storage and a cargo that has not been sold? Floating storage is an intentional act to take oil out market. Not selling a cargo is because there are no buyers. Big difference
110 2018-02-01 23:45:42 Oh, did @Shell find a better way to not dump oil in a gulf or anything?
111 2018-02-01 23:45:39 Yeah, we have done sesame oil (although I’m partial to butter) and there’s ginger paste in the fridge just now waiting to find some Ramen! 
112 2018-02-01 23:45:38 Perks of nightly soaking my hair in olive oil overnight, my hair has never been softer
113 2018-02-01 23:44:39 At first I thought it was ignorance on your part however I'm starting to believe you have a vested interest in @realDonaldTrump's connections to Russia. How much do you own in oil/gas stocks that will benefit from the #TrumpRussiaCollusion? Truly you're a disgrace for the Nation.
114 2018-02-01 23:44:39 I can never not put on lotion on my body & coconut oil cream on my face after I shower. Its a muussstttt
115 2018-02-01 23:44:19 So finally @nytimes picking up on fact that Hemp is most useful plant on earth. Long piece on how hemp is most sustainable building material, more so than concrete or steel. The name is hempcrete. Demonized because of its marijuana strain by fearful oil & steel companies.
116 2018-02-01 23:44:18 Leaving the shores of DUNKIRK!

117 2018-02-01 23:44:17 How many other accused criminals have been allowed to have overview of the officers investigating them? Ridiculous. #RemoveTreasonWeaselNunes #ChargeTrumpWithTreason for not enacting Russian sanctions and importing Russian oil into America instead. Exxon deal ring a bell, anyone?
118 2018-02-01 23:43:26 Guess I'll have to skip this one. One snake oil sales pitch is enough for a show.

123 2018-02-01 23:42:36 I woulda got $5 off my oil change which was like $30. That would have been a sice like shit
124 2018-02-01 23:42:28 Same way he says he wants to fight climate change and sets up a carbon tax plan but then approves pipelines and says shit like "No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there" 
125 2018-02-01 23:42:17 That is awesome! Are they using oil pastels for the color part?
126 2018-02-01 23:42:10 I have no idea, but ships full of oil are floating there

128 2018-02-01 23:42:03 I’m not actually sure what he was talking about. My black Forrest ham with pep jack, lettuce, tomatoes and olive oil was sure tasty. The lady in front of me wanted hers extra toasted. She said “give me cancer...”
129 2018-02-01 23:41:52 How does getting rid of safety regulations help us?  Like how it helped those who just died on an oil rig? Or the one where now our parents can be abused in nursing homes and not get in trouble? Or taking away overtime?
130 2018-02-01 23:41:45 Coconut oil after every wax
131 2018-02-01 23:41:41 Thinking of my Valentine's with Zwi ...all the sweet surprises i have got lined up...and where I'm gonna get massage oil to finish the day  mnandi !!!
132 2018-02-01 23:41:41 I dont do much, I just clean my face with the Silk n’ Swirl face brush using neutrogena oil free face wash, I use Dickinson’s Witch Hazel and then I just moisturize with 100% Aloe Vera gel.
133 2018-02-01 23:41:35 Fabulous! I've been using oil pastels for dogs but I'm going to try coloured pencils. Thank you for sharing.
134 2018-02-01 23:41:32 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
135 2018-02-01 23:41:18 tara, oil and water repel eachother... the fields surrounding every individual molecule of the two substances repel each other..they never even come in contact with eachother
136 2018-02-01 23:41:16 Please don't let GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians continue for British oil. Life is precious before the LORD. REFERENDUM.
137 2018-02-01 23:41:12 I've had olive oil gelato before, so I'm convinced a savory gelato can be a satisfying experience
138 2018-02-01 23:41:09 You are nothing but a snake oil salesman!  What comes around goes around!
139 2018-02-01 23:41:07 My white slip on vans have motor oil stains on them because I’m a fuckin IDIOT and decided to work on my car with them on hahahahaha :’)

142 2018-02-01 23:40:55 Don’t worry. I’ll get another vote. Either in EU or Out of the UK #indyref2 #FBPE
Finance sector to Paris
Scotland keeps our oil
England gets to keep ReesMogg, Bojo and Gove.

143 2018-02-01 23:40:51 But I love oil/butter!
144 2018-02-01 23:40:50 The robust association between spikes in world oil prices and US economic downturns are documented by James Hamilton of the University of California San Diego. The results show that,over the long sweep of history, every recession but one was preceded by an increase in oil prices.
145 2018-02-01 23:40:46 Im mad I found my oil change coupon after I got an oil change. Type shit is that
146 2018-02-01 23:40:32 made? Well similar things happen on communications research.  IMO Bush was "there" and has earned the shaeffing. But the really great stuff in Family of Secrets are the details of the early oil industry and that nexus around Wilson. Amazing book!

155 2018-02-01 23:40:08 All we will say is this: February will be the last buying opportunity month of 2018. We remain in a multi year bull market for oil. We plan on adding more to our fav names this month. Oil Fundamentals have not been this strong in long time.
156 2018-02-01 23:40:08 Waiting to get your oil changed at a car dealership is pure torture! All the pretty cars. #fast car junky #toooldforthat

159 2018-02-01 23:39:49 Apparently Nina has never heard of coconut oil or any fractionated fats. Is this thing like 10 years old or something?
160 2018-02-01 23:39:45 I'm quite sure that since Trump is not allowing the Russian sanctions to take place, it allows Putin to use Trump to extract uranium from mining in our National Parks and Federal Lands and drilling for oil in his special spots; that also includes Alaska and the Arctic
161 2018-02-01 23:39:41 There's no fracking in NJ, mostly because we have no oil or natural gas.  

IDK how people out of state would get to our aquifer, unless it reaches to PA or Maryland.

168 2018-02-01 23:38:11 I have a real hard time waking up in the mornings and it usually takes me at least an hour to become functional. I've been putting a few drops of tea tree oil on my pillow at night to clear up my sinuses but I've noticed I'm now waking up with a spring in my step from the get go!

173 2018-02-01 23:37:32 I bought it with 90,000 miles on it. In the 160,000 miles I drove it, I put on two sets of tires, one set of brakes, and a wheel bearing. No tune-ups, nothing except oil changes. When it hit 250,000 then things started going

185 2018-02-01 23:36:26 Stupid Shithole Trump says he "really didn't care" about raping the Arctic Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling except Russia (Putin) called him about Russian drilling to make them both rich. It is worth Trillions of dollars to Trump, Putin, and Exxon-Mobil !

188 2018-02-01 23:36:11 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
189 2018-02-01 23:36:05 THE INTRUDER WITHIN is an enjoyable made for TV film, taking elements from ALIEN and THE THING, but being it's own weird little thing. On an oil rig, monster is drilled out from under the sea. Don't want to ruin the little things in the film, like a strange birth scene.

191 2018-02-01 23:35:37 Good point about the timing, but not the pacing; consider the trade-offs of new otgs like BRC, who r haphazardly cutting corners. There's even buzz that some facility's basic utilities bills r past due, such as it's smaller new experimental stabilization bed programs. Fuel oil...

Coconut oil in Combination with Maize and Sugar Alcohol, Barbados could make maybe a own fuel ? And among other the Maize and Sugarcane waste
195 2018-02-01 23:35:18 I've had to deal with this when I couldn't tell how much fuel oil was left and ran out. I managed by closing all the doors to rooms I wasn't using and hanging up blankets across the doorways when there wasn't a door. It helped keep the area I was using a lot warmer.
196 2018-02-01 23:35:13 Russia is flooded with oil money, and has much more oil

231 2018-02-01 23:31:15 It’s an essential oil. You have to dilute  it with a lighter carrier oil like argan oil when using it on your skin.
232 2018-02-01 23:31:11 True, but higher prices mean more oil is produced more profitably, hence more taxes, plus very importantly it helps balance of trade.

286 2018-02-01 23:24:49 G, u need a guy to rub that oil in? 
287 2018-02-01 23:24:44 This new Arsenal is sooo german... Oil, Mustafi, Auba, Mkhi..plus Mertesaker and Lehmann as managers from next year, the new Football director from Borussia and Arsene Wenger that is in fact half German... I like it
288 2018-02-01 23:24:26 Stupid Shithole Trump says he "really didn't care" about raping the Arctic Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling except Russia (Putin) called him about Russian drilling to make them both rich. It is worth Trillions of dollars to Trump, Putin, and Exxon-Mobil !
289 2018-02-01 23:24:16 Use cheap foundation but my skin is so fricken oily  but I found those little oil paper things you blot your face with work really good 
290 2018-02-01 23:24:14 oil of oregano - take it straight or chase it with manuka honey if ur a wuss like me. couple that with lotsa fluids/sleep and it's some serious Black Magicks
291 2018-02-01 23:24:02 .@IJM if i had a car i would drive it from Alaska to Virginia just to get a oil change and support you and @KirkCousins8 !
292 2018-02-01 23:23:58 Oil and gas is the bread and butter for Russians... they are desperate to support somebody that will help bring oil prices up... and that is Donal Trump!
293 2018-02-01 23:23:57 I want to believe it so bad, but the country is infected by the Salafi thinking. It infected all the Middle East with the same thoughts. They used their oil money to spread all that hatful teaching that there is no come back. It’s generational problem and it will take decades!
294 2018-02-01 23:23:48 Nope. 
The Earth experiences cyclical climate changes - farther back than humans have had the ability to record.
Note: coal, diamonds (And other 'semi-precious' stones), natural gas, oil, and petrified wood (which I have found in the desert).
295 2018-02-01 23:23:47 I do. Do they find human tools in oil deposits?
296 2018-02-01 23:23:40 Yeah! Oil prices below $70 a barrel! Hey #Pennsylvania why’d you just raise pump prices to almost $3.00!#Robbers #InMyPocket #GasTaxTooHigh
297 2018-02-01 23:23:37 About the motor oil?... 
298 2018-02-01 23:23:24 I made cup cakes and forgot the oil what’s gonna happen
299 2018-02-01 23:23:22 Michael Scott is trapped in an oil painting
300 2018-02-01 23:23:11 "environment and economy go hand in hand" - says @jimcarr_wpg.

No, burning oil is heating our planet.   Expanding the oilsands will heat our planet more.

Maybe promote green jobs instead of shilling for Texas oil companies.
301 2018-02-01 23:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Trump explains support for oil drilling in Arctic refuge
302 2018-02-01 23:22:57 I fucking hate winter. If the states wants to split North America down the middle vertically, I'd be really okay with that. They can even take the side with all the oil on it, I don't care at this point.
303 2018-02-01 23:22:55 BREAKING: ExxonMobil's Rex Tillerson Eyes World's Largest Oil Reserve. IN OTHER NEWS: Water Is Wet.
304 2018-02-01 23:22:53 So this admin feels like the best place to build a refinery is a non oil producing place like...... Like the border between Nigeria and Niger. 

Lol! Rem bubu once voted against Nigeria for a fulani from Niger, being the first president to vote against his country man at the AU.
305 2018-02-01 23:22:47 Except it was one of the first things he proposed. And what about off shore oil drilling? A good thing? Removing protections for national parks? Good? Does him ignoring the Russian sanctions also help us? How? Name a regulation he removed that helps me.

310 2018-02-01 23:22:27 So a hatching you think?  Haven’t used that product, know there has been issued raised with others. Mostly fipronil & sulfoxaflor leaving my shed, some with salt and some with biopest oil
311 2018-02-01 23:22:24 That’s less than 1% per month for a large tanker with 2m bbl a day. If you have a lot of oil (like a cartel) you could easily push prices that much higher if you starved the worlds most visible stockpile (the US) of oil for a few weeks
312 2018-02-01 23:21:21 Can you imagine if that was heavy dilbit oil as Kinder Morgan wants There would be no recovery & would be catastrophic for all of us. KM pipeline Trudeau is not worth risk. Screw your business reasons even they are weak
313 2018-02-01 23:21:07 One girl tried to add oil to a sauté pan without taking it off of the stove  and refused to finish cooking her pasta when the pan flared
314 2018-02-01 23:21:01 Barça snubbed Umtiti for only 25m while Guardiola keeps buying defenders for 50+m of Oil money. That's not fair..!
315 2018-02-01 23:20:58 Interestingly, the only thing that China really wants from Canada is oil and natural gas, all things that the BC govenment is trying to stop at the BC/ALB border.  Horgan is a virtue signaling ass hat.
316 2018-02-01 23:20:52 @jjhorgan  Tell Alberta they can ship out refined bitumen..as in upgraded into conventional oil....That way you aren't stopping Alberta's product from moving west..n you might have legal leg to stand on...Deem bitumen too hazardous n set rules for only upgraded bitumen to flow
317 2018-02-01 23:20:49 Having Untreated Oil and Grease Stains on Your Driveway Could Cost You $380,000...
318 2018-02-01 23:20:44 Muslim sects have been killing each other for over a thousand years *before* we starting using oil.

The idea that it’s the fault of capitalism is just asinine.
319 2018-02-01 23:20:43 I'd rather build refineries in BC and supply them using BC oil. Building refineries in Alberta creates jobs for Albertans not British Columbians 

Well on the other hand if Alberta gets more jobs maybe all the Albertans who moved here after job losses can go back home
320 2018-02-01 23:20:40 Oilsands is privatized, meaning those who benefit work in the oil and gas industry.

The vast majority of Canadians don't and why 'we' don't benefit from oilsands expansion.   #pnpcbc #ableg #cdnpoli

323 2018-02-01 23:20:27 What are the names? I would like some producers as a hedge for my short oil trade, and also because they haven’t participated in the upside
324 2018-02-01 23:20:20 Our hair has a lot of oil and nasty grease so that could be the problem :( ever since i let my bangs grow my acne has gone away
325 2018-02-01 23:20:02 That seriously sucks  try taking vitamins ! I saw someone told you to try castor oil & trust me, I used it on my brows overnight and when I woke up the next day my hair was already growing back 
326 2018-02-01 23:19:50 No, on the contrary, we need more honest transparency within our federal government. Even if it means full disclosure of the WTC Building 7 collapse. All the Democrats did was take advantage and exploit the American people by maintaining the coverup. Oil paint that George Jr.
327 2018-02-01 23:19:47 This testing on animals is beyond disgusting!! Canabis oil cures all cancers yet it's banned

330 2018-02-01 23:19:07 @RachelNotley Talk is cheap with BC get on with it and close the oil pipeline that feeds BC refinery if BC wants war on pipelines
331 2018-02-01 23:18:50 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump tax reduction great for Americans but not if the xtra dollars are given to oil companies because they are increasing the price of gas
332 2018-02-01 23:18:48 Can’t lie I sure did miss the oil fields back to the good ol days

336 2018-02-01 23:18:22 The field oaf #AI had a paradigm shift when it entered the age of data -driven AI. Data is the new oil. #DataIsTheNewOil as @realDonaldTrump wuld say "we mine all that BEAUTIFUL data".
337 2018-02-01 23:18:21 @realDonaldTrump tax reduction great for Americans but not if the xtra dollars are given to oil companies because they are increasing the price of gas
338 2018-02-01 23:18:18 So  Chumpy can help his Oil butties
339 2018-02-01 23:18:18 No, you just refuse to see that the US did invade Iraq for Oil and North Korea who we know at the time it was developing atom bombs and did nothing because North Korea did not rise a threat to the Petrodollar.
340 2018-02-01 23:18:18 I imagine they will ignore it the way zinke ignores all the comments about his oil cronyism
341 2018-02-01 23:17:59 As awesome as that sounds, oil paint is really expensive. *not sure if you're serious about doing this or not... so sarcasm could've been lost through the void of the internet... so potential "sorry" if you weren't serious*
342 2018-02-01 23:17:42 Communist and leftest ignore women in Iran!? how cute
More like the right love to spread the fact that "islam is opressive" but buy weapons from the saudis and take their oil and occupy the middle east
343 2018-02-01 23:17:37 I think she would just ignore it and not put oil into the fire because she doesn't like a petty type to throw out/ make fun of a gift publicly.. But i guess her fans know her better
344 2018-02-01 23:17:22 んーチャリで行くか
345 2018-02-01 23:17:18 A wanky (not literally !) way of saying oil?!
346 2018-02-01 23:17:17 Not permanently. Besides, I am sure the technology exists that will minimize the impact of future oil spills.  No business will want to undergo what DEEP WATER HORIZON/BP went through after the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill.
347 2018-02-01 23:17:10 Reading about Almond oil, grape seed oil, Castor oil, Olive oil.  Too many oils got me all oil lot a trouble.  I want to buy them all

351 2018-02-01 23:16:51 Lots of folk deluding themselves they aren't going to be a WHOLE lot worse off after brexit. It's going to be WAY worse than even remainers think. Banks/London won't be able to keep Ruk afloat& you won't have Scotland's massive oil reserves. Feel bad for the decent folk. #BBCQT
352 2018-02-01 23:16:45 I suggest doing a hot bucket of water and doing a light rinse outside or something. Coconut oil gets solid when it cools and you don't want that in your drains
353 2018-02-01 23:16:36 I’ve always been anti-coconut oil. The shit reeks.
354 2018-02-01 23:16:32 my budget car, 50k miles, changed brakes, tyres and refilled oil. a ferrari could no way shape or form be possible of doing that, just do some googling. they barely make it past 10k miles without a fault.

364 2018-02-01 23:15:41 Yeah I agree,  would just be nice if somehow we could find a way to do studies that have not been funded by the sugar lobby, meat lobby, egg lobby, olive oil council, butter council, vegan religion, 7th day adventists,  bigpharma, big foods or coke cola !  just unbiased science !
365 2018-02-01 23:15:35 She does.  We have pictures of her attending protests.  She hired anti oil sands advisors. She employs a carbon tax saying it will reduce emissions, and has no monitoring system she is anti fossil fuels that is a statement of fact.
366 2018-02-01 23:15:34 Yes, the SNP has no logic in their position now. The 2 negatives for independence are the reduction in oil revenues and Brexit. Independence now is like turkeys voting for Christmas.

368 2018-02-01 23:15:29 @GenericGene Thanks for the like, Gene - EVs are really cool, but there's still a lot of oil/gas to be used up before they take over. Gonna be fun to watch.

385 2018-02-01 23:13:51 And with Russia so invested in oil exports, why is Trump excessively taxing solar products and fighting against renewable energy?  He’s daddy Putin’s little baby.

436 2018-02-01 23:08:02 It’s not about running out or not. It’s about how much tax revenue you get from oil. At present there is pretty much none.

478 2018-02-01 23:02:46 And they never invade small countries for oil. Iraq is a large country, and Afghanistan has no oil. @fanjulb @FernandoAmandi

482 2018-02-01 23:02:06 Because my refinery system runs 1mbpd of crude oil it is in the Mediterranean and in a backwardated market we would be seeing that offered to us every single day. And we are not. So floating storage is not there.

485 2018-02-01 23:01:41 I don't recall USA invading for oil. They invaded Iraq because Bush was stupid, but the oil was a minor issue @fanjulb @FernandoAmandi

Norway CAS=5% of GDP (much of this is oil, but this was higher pre-2016)
Austria CAS=3% of GDP

503 2018-02-01 23:00:00 Healthy Options!  But these are essential oils ha, you don't put them directly on your skin kasi it'll burn. You have to put a few drops in carrier oil (like vco, sunflower, jojoba, etc) or in water.

505 2018-02-01 22:59:17 Norway because they have been storing oil revenues since the 80s, fossil fuels is paying for them. Sweden and Finland have had a reduction in services due to the costs associated.

571 2018-02-01 22:49:57 Egads. Using BC wine (small) to  make a statement for oil & gas (not so small)? #lesigh
572 2018-02-01 22:49:54 OMG, not just Nunes. Clean house of everyone selling snake oil.
573 2018-02-01 22:49:54 And a can of oil
574 2018-02-01 22:49:43 And finally oil hike is maintained. Weldone buhari @APCUKingdom @APCNigeria @MBuhari
575 2018-02-01 22:49:18 Bought the later drop on NG and sold the bounce...small gain. Retired my remaining oil shorts on break of 66....big loss. Not my best day.
576 2018-02-01 22:49:15 We could say the same about Muslims, when someone keeps attacking and plundering their countries for oil wouldn’t they create a volatile situation or expect some backlash? All humans are the same when they are cornered.
577 2018-02-01 22:49:11 You know you’re getting old when you ask for an oil change for your birthday

585 2018-02-01 22:47:18 Theres two oils avail on Moxee today! The first is the oil is for dry, patchy skin- or people wanting less wrinkles, more of a moisturizing oil. The 2nd is used with Hemp Seed oil & Grapeseed as the carrier oils. This is the Acne fighting one, called Aura Acne. Both look the same

589 2018-02-01 22:46:39 @realDonaldTrump I AM THE HEIR TO A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR OIL FORTUNE THAT IS SITTING IN THE US TREASURY'S COFFERS... 5 YEARS AND 32 DAYS WORTH OF AMASSED OIL CHECKS THAT WERE PRINTED EVERY 2 WEEKS.
590 2018-02-01 22:46:23 You know who owns the government 

THE OIL COMPANIES

that’s the problem 

‘They’ want us to keep driving

Europe and Asia doesn’t have this problem and they have transit that actually works in a reasonable manner
591 2018-02-01 22:46:22 I hate cooking sometimes. The frying oil stayed steady at 220 for 10 whole minutes. I walk away for two minutes and it shoots up to 380
592 2018-02-01 22:46:08 The larger question is was Carter Page acting on behalf of Trump in negotiations with Rosneft, Russian oil company currently under US sanctions, to buy 20% of that company? Someone bought that stake but who?

That would make Trump pissed about the FISA & more reason to lift sanct

594 2018-02-01 22:46:03 128.6 yesterday— crazy ?? What was the price when oil was over $100 a barrel?

596 2018-02-01 22:45:35 Take Vitamin D and fish oil everyday for depression.  It works for many people.  At least 3,000 mg a day in fish oil. 1,000 mg a day in Vitamin D.  Exercise creates endorphins...the feel good hormones that give runner's a natural high.

603 2018-02-01 22:44:43 If you can get your Mum to massage your throat, neck and top back with either some oil or we have something we have in England called vapour rub, it smells very medicinal but works wonders and will hopefully ease your throat, firm strokes when massaging.

614 2018-02-01 22:42:22 Okay, so remember when I was talking about taking fish oil and zinc to naturally help with my severe acne? It had literally been two years of HORRIBLE blemishes that wouldn’t go away no matter what I did. For the first time, thanks to the supplements, my skin is finally clear!
615 2018-02-01 22:42:20 Got pics?  This is the one that is the same body as a lumina but has a 350?  Change your muffler, sand the rust off give macco $350 for paint and enjoy 100,000 more miles.  Use synthetic oil!
616 2018-02-01 22:42:20 sustaining the fiscal adjustment that led to the recent compression of imports is likely to be hard.   Then again Saudi's BoP break-even was never much above $70 (look at the estimates for 14/15).   So as always the price of oil tends to drive the near-term dynamics
617 2018-02-01 22:42:20 Trump said Thursday that he had little interest in opening Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling until a friend “who’s in that world and in that business” called and told him Republicans have been trying to do so for decades.
618 2018-02-01 22:42:13 Is experienced from smoking or just the CBD oil?
619 2018-02-01 22:42:12 You’re right, concerns remain about Egypt falling into Russia’s grip(nearly happened under McFaul & HRC!), Russia testing NATO southern tier & China’s push into the M. East & monopolizing LNG/oil in the future. We can go back & forth, there’s no clear cut answer to any of this.
620 2018-02-01 22:42:04 They invaded Iraq because of Oil. If they cared about Christians they would not have toppled the secular government and replaced it with a Shia government.

629 2018-02-01 22:40:49 Electric cars actually run on oil Natural Gas hydropower nuclear wind and solar. Your car doesn't. It runs on oil. And if you're using oil made from tar Sands it's just about as dirty as coal.

1. Initiated the FISA on Paige 5 years ago
2. Keep the FISA running on Paige as he met with Russians about sanctions, oil and money

Without that information- spinning this is just that- a spin.

656 2018-02-01 22:37:56 I did not rape World Oil unless you denied fact.  I have raped an oil company before though.  It can not believe that Coca-Cola & Honda did not pounce providing a girlfriend.  Coca-Cola was mean in my brainwaves & biorhytms manipulation.  I am raping the Earthlings as a result.

662 2018-02-01 22:37:14 We are already decades behind because of people thinking there is no rush and letting oil and other dirty energy have their way.

668 2018-02-01 22:36:41 Its not the feds. In December, 2017, oil prices hit a a 30-month high. Traders responded to the November 30, 2017, OPEC meeting where members agreed to keep production cuts through 2018. If we could produce and refine our own it would be cheap. Tree huggers and libs stop that
669 2018-02-01 22:36:37 Well, Bush 43 lied about going into Iraq, for a Oil grab ! Trump 45 when back to Iraq and defeated ISIS in a year !!

677 2018-02-01 22:35:10 I think nuclear misses some key resonance that a metaphor should have. On the human side it doesn't have the imperial overtones as BECCS, nor on non-human side the same biodiversity threat. What about palm oil/soya biodiesel? Though I appreciate that's not much metaphor!
678 2018-02-01 22:35:10 DO YOU HAVE PEPERMINT OIL OR ARE YOU EXCLUSIVELY A TEA TREE KIND OF GUY
679 2018-02-01 22:35:09 Have been reading about blockchain replacing certification in palm oil recently - quite interesting, and ‘Nature 3.0’ captures this really well!

682 2018-02-01 22:34:16 What oil estimates? You do know, currently, neither the UK government nor the Scottish government sell any oil, right? You realise ALL north sea oil and gas is currently given away for FREE, right?

684 2018-02-01 22:34:06 Parking mainly lol, it’s small and can just leave it near a train station on a tight road without paying for extortionate car park fees- it’s forever breaking in one way or another. Oil light flashes after a few miles as they end up burning out a valve due to weak design..

712 2018-02-01 22:31:33 You've got to be kidding me. Philly PD is going to cover the poles in gear oil to keep people off them if the Eagles win. Come on. Just let people climb the damn poles. Much better than slathering oil all over the city.
713 2018-02-01 22:31:04 I've been trying vinegar and oil
714 2018-02-01 22:30:50 @realDonaldTrump They knew (because of listening in) that I am an advocate for solar panels Sir. (who'd a thunk it, an oil owner) The other morning when you signed that tariff the FBI didn't hesitate to blast my phone front page with it. I knew what they were doing.
715 2018-02-01 22:30:44 A parody of a unison or Gmb  shop steward debater! Where nobody disputes or challenges the topic. There is a saying in Oil & Gas “promoted above his pay grade”. A Sad state of Labour Party in Scotland . #bangbangthemightyfall
716 2018-02-01 22:30:35 Oh No I’m out of tea tree oil and apparently I was not prepared for this level of emergency
717 2018-02-01 22:30:31 OIL DIFF: 4.04 -> 4.11
718 2018-02-01 22:30:20 See I’ve been using coconut oil for years, so old what the hell happened
719 2018-02-01 22:30:18 I agree with your concern. I have been in oil and gas for 30 years and tank farms are built to very high standards. Safety systems are state of the art it is not like 50 years ago. You set need to listen to some energy ind people and get facts to much bs out there
720 2018-02-01 22:30:17 I couldn’t agree more. Him and all of his oil !!!
721 2018-02-01 22:30:17 @MrTireAuto EVERY TIME I want an Oil change i dont need new tires! this is absolutely CRAZY!!!
722 2018-02-01 22:30:12 The main privelidge I have seen is those that are in on getting a slice of federal money.  That includes mostly fat cat corporations that work for the Federal govt. right now that’s defense industry, and most recently insurance and medical companies. Banks and oil of course
723 2018-02-01 22:30:02 BP announces 2 two North Sea discoveries which might mean Scotland capable of surviving on more than just whisky and tourism. Amazing how the oil reserves seem to rise and fall whenever Scottish independence is mentioned.
724 2018-02-01 22:29:57 My car is bumping rap and I scared the guy doing my oil change
725 2018-02-01 22:29:50 Cyril would you please stop inventing your own alternative facts. You're embarrassing yourself by showing such ignorance. The amount you know about the oil industry could be written on a fly's wing. You're not related to Donald Trump by any chance?
726 2018-02-01 22:29:43 Oh, the surge in oil price and new fields are all over the internet...just not on MSM
727 2018-02-01 22:29:35 I take 1000mg of Vitamin C and high strength cod liver oil from Sainsbury’s I have taken a photo for your info - I definitely think you should consider taking them
728 2018-02-01 22:29:33 Nigerian police will never change. Busy collecting money at forte oil maitama just allow people beat the queue
729 2018-02-01 22:29:30 Looked amazing! My first car was a 1997 Volvo 850 Sportswagon. It ended up having a badly clogged PCV system and pushing oil into the cooling system. That's when I sold it... for $2100. Sorry person I sold that to. I don't have a picture of it on this phone.
730 2018-02-01 22:29:18 When you want that dewy hydrated look but only end up looking like an oil pit... Yeah, story of my life.
731 2018-02-01 22:29:17 Need some help!!

Do I get 1:1 tincture oil for $40 or do I get full THC tincture oil for $50 ??
732 2018-02-01 22:29:13 "He is an intellectual snake oil salesman, exploiting a genuine need...for meaning and order. His aim is little more than the pursuit of his own vanity and the P.T. Barnum-ish padding of his own pockets. He is a prophet, for profit."

Yeah, but he did get me to clean my room.
733 2018-02-01 22:29:05 I need eggs, milk, oil and cocoa powder and powdered sugar. Actually I need a lot . Nvm
734 2018-02-01 22:29:00 They have a almond mint oil that I loved when i tried a sample but I'm a avocado oil devotee.

738 2018-02-01 22:28:29 So fish boxes , rubber gloves , pots nets rope monofilament oil drums pallets all come from ' land ' ? Interesting , how wrong was I
739 2018-02-01 22:28:29 Feel free to deliver as much olive oil as you want to my location
740 2018-02-01 22:28:13 I can't hear your calls for looking into their Ties over the calls to reduce Bears Ears and GSE so 'locals get more say' in how we lease the land to mining and oil companies.
741 2018-02-01 22:28:07 if you get a cauliflower head and blitz it in a blender or roughly chop it and put it in the oven for 20 min with a bit of olive oil and salt.....if you do it this way the smell and taste is DIVINE!!
742 2018-02-01 22:28:04 Oh? Did the Dems double national park fees? Weaken the CFPB’s ability to protect consumers? Fail to sanction Russia for violating the voting systems of 21 states? Open oil and gas exploration in ANWR, jeopardizing the caribou herds? That’s destruction.
743 2018-02-01 22:27:56 i want to be smothered in the garlic butter oil
744 2018-02-01 22:27:51 Removed an oil and vinegar stain out of a white #JCrew shirt successfully so I feel pretty damn accomplished today 
745 2018-02-01 22:27:49 Any chance you'll use oil and gas products to make your way home? Or will you come home on Unicorn farts and Fairy dust? 

You are amongst the most hypocritical people I could ever imagine. Use all the unethical Oil in the world to get home!
746 2018-02-01 22:27:49 bible has nothing to do with Russia wanting our oil.....
747 2018-02-01 22:27:46 You get that SO HARD with both FOX and CNN it's actually incredibly exhausting. Like no one's talking about the massive super oil spill that was burning for multiple days in the ocean recently.
748 2018-02-01 22:27:36 Smoked tofu, then pan fried in a bit of seseme oil. Serve over rice with a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, rice vinegar, basil and sambal (or sriracha). Top with a fried or hardboiled egg and green onions with kimchi on the side! 
749 2018-02-01 22:27:10 The kid is next to me. Full of snot, snoring. I want to rip his nose off however I’m high from all the olbas oil I’ve put on the pillow. Which is clearly having zero effect on his nose. Shoot me

753 2018-02-01 22:26:35 Yeap because most of them are no oil paintings
754 2018-02-01 22:26:31 In oil man language, that’s probably a dry hole.
755 2018-02-01 22:26:21 I have to call you out on this Tweet.
Obama single-handedly crippled the Russian Economy with Sanctions.
Check the value of the Ruble in 1/09 (24r:1usd)and 12/16(74r:1usd) 
Russia's major export is oil which in traded in USD. 
They had to sell almost 3x the oil for the same $$
756 2018-02-01 22:26:21 Olbas oil is really doing it for me rn #sickofbeingsick
757 2018-02-01 22:26:13 ”I took a walk on the beach, no sand dunes just oil/Dead gulls and dead fish were trod underfoot/The sky was tinted with yellow and black/And the air smelt like Dachau today”
758 2018-02-01 22:26:07 Try palm oil
759 2018-02-01 22:26:07 Double-edged sword...it also gives a farther-reaching pulpit for snake oil salesmen to peddle their shtick. Many of them are good enough at weaving enough truths into their web that they appear authoritative on their subjects. The internet works well for deniers, unfortunately.
760 2018-02-01 22:26:05 And I was thinking of doing a leaf salad on the side with hazelnut oil! Gosh, we’re good! X

764 2018-02-01 22:25:35 Awesome news! It affirms the reason to oppose expanding offshore drilling in the Atlantic EEZ. We don't need to risk fisheries. We have a glut of oil ashore! Awesome!
765 2018-02-01 22:25:30 Just to add to your comment, Venezuela is planning to release a Petro token that is backed by its Oil reserves
766 2018-02-01 22:25:14 Uber shaking up car manufacturers. 
Air bnb shaking up hotels. 
Netflix/apple/amazon shaking up broadcasters and Hollywood. 
Itunes/spotify shaking up record labels.

None of them own cars/hotels/studios or artists. 
Data is the new oil. 
#NewRules
767 2018-02-01 22:25:01 Maybe he has the right of. The rest of the Oil maybe should be taking a page out of his book. Kind of sounds like how Babcock treats his team. It’s a privilege for the media to interact with them. Not a right. I think this is something the Oilers should adopt. 1/2
768 2018-02-01 22:24:52 Between cheap solar panels and cheap batteries, the world is on the cusp of a new age of energy.

"The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil." - Sheikh Yamani, Saudi Arabia
769 2018-02-01 22:24:48 #USA: tight oil production amounted to 51% of US oil production in November 2017, as against 7% in November 2008 (Source: US Energy Information Administration)
770 2018-02-01 22:24:48 Lol, Abdul na kpaff but the problem na sey the prawn gas sink inside the oil and the butter no too plenty

772 2018-02-01 22:24:38 Funny how oil prices have been rising even with all this cutting of regulations and building of pipelines. 
773 2018-02-01 22:24:36 Rosehip oil is changing my skin's life 
774 2018-02-01 22:24:26 Oil
775 2018-02-01 22:24:17 Hey Sexy Massage Oil Sex thanks for the follow!
776 2018-02-01 22:24:06 I bought some years ago under the belief that my hair doesn’t grow. Then I realized that even though I shed like a dog I still have TOO much hair & I clog drains. I sent that oil straight to my mom.
777 2018-02-01 22:24:04 The same is happening with oil producers. I find it hard to understand.
778 2018-02-01 22:23:58 Yes, some with the Sarasqueta. Very nice looking wood on it which I stripped and applied an oil finish to myself.
779 2018-02-01 22:23:48 So I have been slowly moving into more Oil & Gas Plays.

Lithium, Gold, Oil & Gas. 

Holding a few plays that took another beating today but I have been actively diversifying
780 2018-02-01 22:23:46 I like those little blotting pieces of paper you can use to mop up oil on your face when you can’t just wash everything!
781 2018-02-01 22:23:44 SNSなどで良く引用されるのがこちらのロイターの記事です。出だしから、「ここ何十年で最悪の石油流出が広がっている（The worst tanker oil spill in decades is unfolding）」とセンセーショナルです。このロイターの記事をもとに「もうじき日本の海が死ぬ」などと危機を訴えるサイトが登場...

>RT
782 2018-02-01 22:23:38 Ask Abdul. I'm the wrongest person to be asked this fam . But it should yeah? Cos melted butter is groundnut oil
783 2018-02-01 22:23:34 Have to wonder how the female audience of #cbb would react if 3 women were sent in, stripped and covered themselves in oil. #doublestandards #cbb
784 2018-02-01 22:23:32 True.  Taxes, for what they provide, is a bargain.   My point about the less than $4- is the dishonesty of the message.  Some will buy the snake oil.  To my brother-pointless-he needs health care more than a pittance.
785 2018-02-01 22:23:25 Once again we agree completely. Now, let’s fix Health insurance. Compare to auto insurance. Do they tell you what mechanic you have to visit?  Does it make you choose not to get an oil change – just because it doesn't pay for it? Does it fix the price of your mechanic’s services?
786 2018-02-01 22:23:16 qq eh oil cleasing
787 2018-02-01 22:23:14 Thanks for all the beautiful scenery.  Sad to see the city hedgehog licking machine oil  Looking forward to Spring.

789 2018-02-01 22:23:02 As you know, de-implementation is hard when there is a vested interest at stake, and it would require patients (and their doctors) to actually read the peer reviewed literature!  Plus taking fish oil is a lot less painful than exercising and eating right...
790 2018-02-01 22:23:00 Depends on what type of bath you’re taking I guess 

If it’s oil and a candle falls in- potentially?

800 2018-02-01 22:22:30 I  had to go to Emerg. at RCH because I followed a Jaime Oliver recipe to the word. "Let the pan get hot, piping hot, then add oil" Next thing I know there's a fire ball shooting down my hall and I am on my patio hitting the damn thing with a dish rag. 2nd deg. burns to my hands.
801 2018-02-01 22:22:26 That's just Metal shavings in the oil 
802 2018-02-01 22:22:23 Go for a $30 oil change... Leave paying almost $300  like I got a Benz or BMW WTF?!

806 2018-02-01 22:22:05 The end customer for crude oil is not important. If you were a good trader you would be making money no matter which direction it is going and not whining about it not happening

Pour the blended pepper into a separate pot and cook on high heat until all of the water dries up.
Pour the red palm oil into a clean, dry pot and bleach until it turns clear. It should look like vegetable oil when done.
Leave the oil to cool down a bit

825 2018-02-01 22:19:08 plenty of oil, obviously. 
826 2018-02-01 22:18:45 Am guessing all those ships storing oil in a backwardated market are owned by the UN and have devices to make them invisible and the oil is used to fill the black helicopters that are going to steal your guns

836 2018-02-01 22:17:58 Bottom line there is plenty of oil to go around..heavy, light or whatever...and there will never ever be a shortage of supply..and there are way too many suppliers..
837 2018-02-01 22:17:51 Did u know #Texas & #Nebraska are the #1 & #2 leading oil exporters in the WORLD, last 5 years plus BUT they STILL STEAL from #American #Citizens at the pump just 4 their own personal #GREED? Nice of @POTUS 2 give tax breaks that is eaten away by big oil taking your piece of pie.
838 2018-02-01 22:17:38 Think of wood as a sponge. Assuming here traditional timber floor boards.

Adding wax or oil good as stops it drying out

Need to consider location & traffic. High traffic then varnish adds a protective layer & locks in moisture.

906 2018-02-01 22:10:23 That’s why North seem to have more population. They take elections more seriously because they got no oil nor port nor comparative human capital! It’s do or die for them. But population -wise, South is far bigger. North uses divide and conquer to win! But it’ll soon end
907 2018-02-01 22:10:20 You’re right in that age it had nothing to do with money because their economy was based on their cattle, seed, oil, wine, etc. that’s why they gave that. We have money as the heighth of our economic system. So we tithe in that.

922 2018-02-01 22:08:20 Why does that even matter ?   This is narcissistic, no ? yes ?

What is MORE important is whether America buys the snake oil he was selling.

990 2018-02-01 21:59:39 Besides amazing real estate prices, utilities are cheaper than average here too. I own a 3200 sq. ft. home, heated by electric and my electric bill for Jan was $170. Up north, my electric bill on a home 1/2 this size averaged $200 per month + $200-$400 per month in heating oil.

992 2018-02-01 21:59:35 Is that when they got caught sneaking oil to NK?
993 2018-02-01 21:59:30 Be careful with the oils you put in oil defusers I’m in a doctors office and they put so much “sweet orange” in this fucking thing i feel like I just ate 5 orange creamsicles and I’m on my 6th
994 2018-02-01 21:59:29 Checking for oil sounds like  jk jk

996 2018-02-01 21:59:12 coconut oil right after a shower > 
997 2018-02-01 21:59:03 It's funny how The Democratic Republic of Congo exports diamonds, copper, gold, and oil in large quantities yet it's on the list of top 10 poorest countries in Africa.
998 2018-02-01 21:59:01 Why is it that I am just now using lip oil
999 2018-02-01 21:58:49 @realDonaldTrump It’s time to rip up that stinking garden.  Replace it with a monument to the Oil Business. Complete with drill and pump.

1009 2018-02-01 21:57:33 I know.  The idea that Russia is collapsing is ridiculous.  Seems to be the exact opposite from what I can tell.  And the price of oil is going up so that is putting more $ in their coffers.
1010 2018-02-01 21:57:23 I've been angry about the way Big oil and gas has treated the environment for years and wrote about it dozens of times. For that, I took much abuse from climate change deniers. Today, @jjhorgan decided 2 protect the environment. I'm glad he did. He should. But it's long overdue.
1011 2018-02-01 21:57:17 shea butter is also supposed to help with acne scars/dark spots too! i use that more than the vitamin e oil that i have and it's okay, but i have yet to find something that really makes a difference for me unfortunately
1012 2018-02-01 21:57:09 Experts agree for decades, there are four too many dams. Turbine oil seeps into water from old generators that have costly upkeep to taxpayers. Clean green now powers the entire city of Las Vegas. Enough studies and failed attempts with fish hatcheries #FREETHESNAKE RIVER NOW!
1013 2018-02-01 21:57:07 U.S. oil production is here. No word salad can save you from it. The data is clear. Get ready for 2018 :)
1014 2018-02-01 21:57:05 $2000 for an oil change? I don’t think so, I’ll take a tesla
1015 2018-02-01 21:57:02 Nunes is a TRAITOR .. so given that ...  I am sure you must have meant illegitimate ??
Snake oil.
1016 2018-02-01 21:57:01 I love how even though I’m allergic to coconut oil my family still cooks with coconut oil
1017 2018-02-01 21:57:00 You all think that retribution is the answer?  The folks in BC have genuine concerns. I do too. But in AB the env probs ignored. REDA assured big oil of doing what it wants. NDP=PCs. Redwater downloads polluter pay to citizens. Y'all in pockets of oil industry. AER can't be sued.
1018 2018-02-01 21:56:45 I was able to try pure oil for vaping but dont like that
1019 2018-02-01 21:56:40 Huh? So energy markets in the US, oil for example, have no relationship to world prices?  That must be why that Keystone pipeline is so important, to get Canadian oil to American refineries to sell to European countries. 
Silly. Of course, you did forget the name of your own DOE.
1020 2018-02-01 21:56:16 BC eco-argument against pipelines predicated on errant belief they're decreasing CAD oil production. In reality, they're decreasing oil cos' netbacks, govt revenues & social funding, but increasing profit margins of US oil refining.

1026 2018-02-01 21:55:41 It boggles my mind that CBD oil is a Schedule I drug.
1027 2018-02-01 21:55:17 How’s tomorrow sound :)
1028 2018-02-01 21:55:09 I don't know where you come from or whatever, but you tell me what difference is between clean coal technology and clean coal. Might I suggest, if you concerned with politics, to worry about the pipelines your happy nice guy is building that is leaking oil in native lands.
1029 2018-02-01 21:55:04 So you don't think an oil spill will have an effect on oyster beds or fisheries?
1030 2018-02-01 21:54:47 The thing of it is they definitely want something I have but only meth makers in trailer parks would be so extreme as to kill for it. Oil?

1033 2018-02-01 21:54:07 Demand for oil was growing at 100+....Why will it stop at 66 handle ??
1034 2018-02-01 21:54:02 I don’t know... to me, it’s a ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ scenario. Hatch’s refusal to renew CHIP & fight for tax cuts for the wealthy, his comments to the gallery during ACA repeal efforts, his giving of public lands to oil & gas. He deserves the embarrassment.

1038 2018-02-01 21:53:37 Turkey was trading ISIS oil also. Everyone seems to have a short memory when during the first year of the Syrian uprising Turkey was backing ASSAD an only when they thought ASSAD was done for that they made an about turn. Does US policy include siding with a turncoat Turkey?

1063 2018-02-01 21:50:41 My skincare routine tonight? Oh it’s nothing really! I cleanse my face with camomile oil, then use my glamglow supercleanse, then use my korres exfoliating scrub, then do the glamglow supermud face mask or liquid gold, then moisturise. It really isn’t that much  #whyamilikethis

1068 2018-02-01 21:49:34 Many of your constituents have more important things to worry about: EPA run by coal industry; Interior by oil/fracking, FBI/Justice Dept bullied by Mafia enforcer T; and now Consumer Protection Agency folds to predatory payday lenders (helped fund Mulvaney's last US house run).
1069 2018-02-01 21:49:32 Lot Of fools bought a book from a snake oil pumper. No one needs to prove anything in the book and nothing needs to be a fact !! He beat all others cnn msnbc Maggie Jake Rachael who are just tabloid talkers now to the $$$$ . Fake book is a music sheet compilation
1070 2018-02-01 21:49:24 My oil painting instructor told me I was approaching it like charcoal and I laughed so loud and said “yea.” And he walked away yoikes but then I got way better and he laughed in MY face and said “yes.”
1071 2018-02-01 21:49:23 I went to life drawing! It's grown a lot since I last went to that class around 4 years ago, there was about 100 people there! Decent though, I did some ink stuff, and a tiny bit of graphite which is something I've missed. Next week I might try some oil pastels. :)

1079 2018-02-01 21:48:52 But let us all not forget all the 'world class' safety & clean-up procedures all these oil co.s brag about.  

They always leave out these examples of such in action though.

1085 2018-02-01 21:48:14 There were basically none in Oklahoma until Pruitt and Koch and big oil came to call.

Same in Texas. Then AG Abbott spent his tenures suing the Federal gov’t.  Fracking took hold and suddenly well water became flammable.

Hell yeah!
1090 2018-02-01 21:47:46 Very possible. Oil doesn't let go of highs or lows without re-checking multiple times.

1098 2018-02-01 21:47:10 Actually your website is wrong

Extra Virgin is a production & quality standard.

Is your oil independently tested by an approved lab & testing panel to prove it meets these standards?
1099 2018-02-01 21:47:10 Dubai has less oil than Scotland

1111 2018-02-01 21:45:07 And why is fuel so expensive?

Drilling
Refining
Storage
Yet prices go up, gouging by Big Oil.
1112 2018-02-01 21:45:04 No farmer, no oil company is forced to sell before production and deliver later! They do so because getting the money early will help them to finance production and they know the price they get on delivery! It’s an enabler - not a stopper or controller!

1127 2018-02-01 21:43:27 Yep! The gloves i have arent super rough &i put baby oil &vaseline on after so i dont dry out.
1128 2018-02-01 21:43:27 Same old same old. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.  This country is supposed to be a democracy however it seems minority rules.

1132 2018-02-01 21:42:49 まぁあのフォード6.7LディーゼルのOHVバルブトレーンはチト極圧性が厳しいものがあるみたいですからねぇ。トラブルもやや多いとか。あのレベルが要求されるのはOHVでも一部、OHC系だとほぼ関係ない話にはなるかとは思いますので国内の一般ユーザーが気にする必要のある話ではないでしょうね。
1133 2018-02-01 21:42:27 $285 later and my baby Ponty has a new headlight assembly, oil, and fluids. Glad to finally have THAT done, but know the other headlight looks gross lol
1134 2018-02-01 21:42:27 but its early in 2018, you know who will want to start that up, as well as put oil rigs off our coast.
1135 2018-02-01 21:42:04 maybe just blot off excess oil? or lightly powder areas where it comes off
1136 2018-02-01 21:41:45 No expansion of off shore oil drilling
1137 2018-02-01 21:41:32 In fairness...the Tory’s have governed through the boom bust cycles of the oil industry for decades with zero thought to a Blan B. Big Oil is the major driver for the entire Alberta economy. Looks like the Oil companies are looking south to USA. Sad
1138 2018-02-01 21:41:21 It wasn't carrying 'Bakken type oil' it was carrying stabilized condensate which is mostly a byproduct of natural gas generation.
1139 2018-02-01 21:41:19 Instead of feeling sorry for people in poverty, stop doing the bidding of the oil companies & 1% that are causing income inequality in this country. Your constant slamming of our state doesn't create a single job.

1151 2018-02-01 21:39:39 Norway relies heavily on international trade. Some of Norway’s major products are oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity, and fish. Norway usually trades these goods with the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and America.
1152 2018-02-01 21:39:38 You know you need oil for your breaks when you're driving and you hit the break but the breaks don't break so you almost die
1153 2018-02-01 21:39:34 It's not just fracking wastewater but also from conventional oil and gas drilling.

1155 2018-02-01 21:39:24 No, don’t get it twisted.  Scientists aren’t to blame. Conservative Republicans who are in the pockets of big oil and those with limited education who vote for them ARE.

1164 2018-02-01 21:37:58 Exactly. Our oil is land-locked and B.C gov’t can’t get on board with the Trans pipeline. 

But at least Trudeau chimed in on an Edmonton radio station and said “That pipeline is going to get built”. 

Our oil WILL be sold to the Asian Markest, adding over 800,000 barrels.
1165 2018-02-01 21:37:56 I really hope using a humidifier with tea tree oil will help my chest. After 6 months, I’m so fed up of constantly being ill, exhausted and in pain. I just want to be fit and well again.

I think it's way premature to talk about these sorts of issues when we are just putting together a paper."

1204 2018-02-01 21:33:12 this doesn't even make sense - part of the way TX keeps from having a state income tax is through higher small-business taxes and commercial property taxes. TX is great for business if you're a big oil company and get all the breaks, but not so great for anybody else.

But you can do less or more depending how much you're gonna use (though you can save it in a sealable container for later)

1258 2018-02-01 21:27:18 Would have expected more from a senator....oil is a fungible world wide commodity which is priced by supply/demand and risk premium.  For the first time in my adult life the USA is not in a vulnerable energy position. Maybe if Mass. didnt fight every pipeline lower prices
1259 2018-02-01 21:27:15 if low oil prices lead to under investment in conventional oil and gas, the cycles may be elongated but not actually dampened all that much - depends on the volumetric and temporal running room in existing shale plays and the learning curve for sub-Tier 1 acreage & plays 2/

1270 2018-02-01 21:26:33 We wonder about the snake oil salesmen out there who promise quick turnarounds, but the reality is executives REALLY don’t like to hear that a lean/agile transformation will take years. #slowitdown #realagility

1273 2018-02-01 21:25:38 I would say that the #oil market has been price elastic in the long-term over the last couple decades, just not in the short-term - i.e. the old oil tanker trying to change direction analogy. #US shale could dampen cyclicality perhaps, but ... 1/

1278 2018-02-01 21:24:57 Some of us cycle because we can't afford a car, our child probably won't be able to get a license (being a role model), & we didn't want our beloved cousins who chose military careers to die in yet another oil war. The reasons are complicated & privilege has intersectionality.

1285 2018-02-01 21:24:31 NJ does not have much as far as shale oil goes anyways. So not sure what you are referring to. And when will you talk about LOWERING PROPERTY TAXES in NJ?? We need that answer now!!!! All this other unimportant crap can wait!!!
1286 2018-02-01 21:24:22 This admin is certainly not center right , that would be moderate , but with all the regulations rescinded , climate , lands, oil drilling , they are pretty extreme over most of the country .

That’s all I’m saying lol
1307 2018-02-01 21:22:13 Probably goes on about freedom and small gov (couldn't be bothered to scroll that far) but flips when it comes to oil. "We allow Quebec to import" - looks like he wants big gov to make Quebec take Alberta oil, or it's a lie to support east pipes. A fraud or a liar.

1389 2018-02-01 21:11:39 The longer the U.S. actively avoids green energy the longer the vast untapped oil and gas reserves in Russia maintain value which will be funneled directly into Putin's pockets

1392 2018-02-01 21:11:28 Maybe giving is too loose of a word, but when there's a push to deregulate corporations to explore for oil, dump where they please, and run wide open with no oversite, how is that any different? I know there's a process, and hopefully things get vetted....
1393 2018-02-01 21:11:16 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for an all-kale diet, and put some moon dust essential oil in my diffuser.
1394 2018-02-01 21:11:12 All about the dollar vs hard assets like Gold and Oil imho. As long as the dollar keeps falling...
1395 2018-02-01 21:10:56 The embargo strengthens the Cuban government and hurts the Cuban people. China is building infrastructure.  Russian has forgiven Soviet era debt and is sending oil. The Russians are considering building a military base in Cuba 90 miles from US shore. America First is America AWOL
1396 2018-02-01 21:10:55 my goal is to date a man who knows how to change the oil in my car so i don’t have to worry about FUCKEN WAITING IN LINE TO GET MY OIL CHANGED FOR 2 HOURS

1399 2018-02-01 21:10:35 Venezuela and Guyana are heading to ICJ to settle a century old controversy over land which was awarded to Guyana in a tribunal. The disputed territory makes up 2/3 of Guyana and oil deposits have been found offshore, which has made the controversy much more sensitive.
1400 2018-02-01 21:10:31 @Rwolf1944Bob, Deplorable Bob,  I cannot imagine why law enforcement would want to keep tabs on Carter Page and his involvement in the Russian Rosneft oil sale (19.5%) that was completed December 2016 since the completion of the deal included the lifting of Russian sanctions!

1402 2018-02-01 21:10:20 Lying Pence you and Trump have no credibility on any issues. Joe Manchin grow a pair and talk directly to your constituents and let them know the real story behind this snake oil and trickle down sham of a tax cut. How many people in your district makes 75,000 dollars not many

1404 2018-02-01 21:10:07 On 1/4  @NYGovCuomo said Trump’s move to allow new offshore oil & gas drilling represents yet another federal assault on our environment & our future. While Washington strong arms #offshoredrilling, New York is adding 800 megawatts of offshore #windpower #ProtectOurCoast
1405 2018-02-01 21:10:03 Hahaha I was waiting for that. £65m of of dirty oil money wasnt enough for you though was it???

1409 2018-02-01 21:09:37 What’s #KingTalkZA about? I’m always confused on Baby Oil Twitter 
1410 2018-02-01 21:09:19 The oil industry is to be slowing strangled to death....it's not polite to talk about it.
1411 2018-02-01 21:09:16 Very funny Oil.
1412 2018-02-01 21:09:14 Moisturizing with water and oil every other day then doing a deep moisturizing in the middle of the week with a leave in and a cream or whatever. 
Keeping the protective style for at least a month
1413 2018-02-01 21:09:13 In this harmattan, one yeye boy with his lips like dried okporoko is arguing with me that he won't oil his body cause rubbing cream is for women and "gay" men. 
Y'all never stop displaying your silliness.
1414 2018-02-01 21:09:11 EU-CIF Energy Mngmnt & Efficiency Non-Reimbursable Grant funding complements the resources being provided in support of the EMEP w/ the general objective of promoting a more efficient use of energy resources that would free up public funds through the reduction of oil imports
1415 2018-02-01 21:09:09 I got a little frustrated today with oil. Have been pretty accurate with it lately & was looking for a rally/backtest today but squeezed through my target. Didn’t place a single buy on any instrument rest of the day. Frustration = silly mistakes. Nothing wrong with sitting cash.
1416 2018-02-01 21:09:08 You might be a major exporter of oil yet you still in Port most of it from us ice meaning the nice country above you

1418 2018-02-01 21:08:55 1976 Subaru GL... it was blue, and I bought it so I could move to GA from VA. It lasted 3 hours when oil flooded the carburetor 
1419 2018-02-01 21:08:53 There was none. It was the olive oil that done it. Antisemites don’t need a segue 
1420 2018-02-01 21:08:50 I say check the oil and if it's okay, go for it!
1421 2018-02-01 21:08:48 Perfect for many things but until you can run a tank or a bomber on it oil will continue to be a strategic resource and we will fight over it.
1422 2018-02-01 21:08:30 when you can save %50 your auto maintenance "parts" but you know the commercialized shop is gonna dodge your request to install your parts at labor costs... is their an auto school down here that does brakes and oil changes? 
1423 2018-02-01 21:08:13 But then Trump's big oil donors don't make as much money....
1424 2018-02-01 21:08:11 Some random sensors!!! One needed repairing and one needed replacing  and some oil 
1425 2018-02-01 21:08:07 City are relevant because of oil: fact
United are relevant because of success: fact

In no way am I saying anything else. would you like to go off on another tangent again or reply with something that relates to what I’m saying...?
1426 2018-02-01 21:07:52 You just got me excited. Well the aim is to keep your ends protected and strong so we can retain length. 
If you already have a moisturizing routine, add castor oil and peppermint oil.
1427 2018-02-01 21:07:50 As #oil price strengthens from the 2015/6 challenges so does the financial economics for commercial driven #recycling. 
#UK recycling killed at sub $45 in 2015.

1429 2018-02-01 21:07:25 my weed falls out of the glovebox while getting an oil change, and the mechanic gives me a high 5 and says they put it back 
1430 2018-02-01 21:07:21 You didn't say the strippers rubbing oil on themselves was lewd Ann.... Why is that? The second one went NEAR @courtneyact she ran away! Don't want to catch gay? Homophobic to the BONE! #CBB
1431 2018-02-01 21:07:21 Repatration doesn't drive capital investment, if they have overseas cash they can can get near free capital anyways. It's a just a different line in the balance sheet. Changes to expensing most likely has a bigger impact on capital investment and for Exxon, the rising oil price
1432 2018-02-01 21:07:11 This always applies to candles, especially soy based ones that use oil. One of the candle brands I follow mentioned it and disclaimed it. Thank goodness for her

1435 2018-02-01 21:06:30 I'm taking my car for an oil change tomorrow, and I swear, the whole Amy Daws / Tires Tires Tires thing has my expectations pretty high.
1436 2018-02-01 21:06:06 Pence is disaster for the country. He is a smoother liar and snake oil salesman. Sucks Koch with all the rest. #PenceIsAKochSucker
1437 2018-02-01 21:06:05 So I scheduled an appointment to get an oil change and my tires rotated at 11:45 at a dealership. It's 1:05 and I'm still here...
1438 2018-02-01 21:06:00 One guy told me I smell like "black girl and flowers"  

Me: what does black girl smell like?!

Him: sweet stuff and hair oil

1442 2018-02-01 21:05:46 Everyone should ask themslf:

Where is the largest fully surveyed oil field?

It is in Russia. They can't tapp it due to sanctions before Trump.

Someone bought 19.5% of the $500billion field before the sanctions were lifted.

Ridiculous!
1443 2018-02-01 21:05:46 yes!!! except how do i remove makeup with oil? put it on a cotton ball and wipe it across my face?

1453 2018-02-01 21:03:56 So looking through your history, does the Australian energy industry pay you to carry so much water for them? You claim to care about climate change but push coal, oil, and natural gas as good things. Shameful.

1455 2018-02-01 21:03:54 As “Oil” is not a commodity. In capitalism oil price (NOT prices ) has always been & will be fixed by the Oil cartels @OilSheppard

1458 2018-02-01 21:03:38 I get compliments on my perfume often, but today I'm wearing some new body oil and like 5 people have told me I smell really good and asked me what I'm wearing.
1459 2018-02-01 21:03:37 How can the dollar be plunging, long-term interest rates and oil prices be surging, yet no one is worried about inflation?   These are all classic signs of a looming inflation problem.
1460 2018-02-01 21:03:35 congrats! cant wait to see what you do.... oil city needs a reality check! x
1461 2018-02-01 21:03:26 Swallowed this cod liver oil capsule and I swear this shit is stuck in my esophagus I feel sick

1463 2018-02-01 21:03:11 I know this happens and unfortunately many places take advantage. I always check my oil after getting an oil change for 2 reasons; 1) to make sure there is fresh oil and 2) to make sure there is enough.

1469 2018-02-01 21:02:13 I took precisely that approach today with one of the highest quality companies with the oil and gas industry. if assigned, I am fortunate for it is a 'forever hold'. Naturally I will layer calls when needed. Have been doing such with some of my portfolio for decades. It pays.

1473 2018-02-01 21:01:35 Sorry, but isnt that raher naieve? Many Scots believe England (there is no such thing as the British state) will do exactly the same as Spain,  on the slightest indication that we will actually leave with our Oil, the only asset that props up Sterling right now against collapse.
1474 2018-02-01 21:01:29 Move the Oilers to Houston, keep the name, powder blue jerseys with oil derricks on them, everyone's happy. Except Edmonton, but who cares.
1475 2018-02-01 21:01:29 You know, the black oil thing.
1476 2018-02-01 21:01:14 The next time you're pumping gas, remember to take the time to check your oil, your washer fluid, clean the windows and headlights, and check the tire pressure.

1479 2018-02-01 21:01:03 Oil +2%
1480 2018-02-01 21:00:51 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1481 2018-02-01 21:00:47 I see the threat on developing expensive oils like shale is Renewable energy solutions and Electric automobile industry. But, opportunity increased over high oil prices !. However, high price give more$$ to improve those threats once more!.

Please give me money!
1489 2018-02-01 21:00:20 Not only that, Scotland has no say in most of its trade within *and outwith* the UK.
It is all power retained by UK gov as we can all plainly witness in the unfolding Brexit, the 111 powers, farming, fishing, Oil & Gas, renewables investment, CC research...
1490 2018-02-01 21:00:11 That makes so much sense! I knew a guy who was born without a sense of smell - except he could smell mint and alcohol. Apparently those ethereal oil scents are process through an entirely different route.
1491 2018-02-01 21:00:01 Wait wasn’t Standard oil most valuable company of all time?

1504 2018-02-01 20:58:23 I used to work in economic forecasting. A snake oil industry. Only confident in short-term predictions given established variables. Almost always inaccurate. Expensive horseshit.
1505 2018-02-01 20:58:00 Just saying, Harper did nothing to get oil to headwaters, it's a little different now. Progress is happening, albeit slower than we'd like. Not a Liberal, just a pragmatist.
1506 2018-02-01 20:57:45 We know he is a seriously sick, sick man but to think that people buy the lies is, perhaps, even sicker. He is the 21st century version of a snake oil salesman and there are customers for the slime.

1521 2018-02-01 20:56:17 My mom's been taking these oil drops for her legs that are actually made out of cannabis. So like 2 hours ago I thought "what the hell" and tried it. The thing is... I might have taken one too many and now I have to go to work and I don't know how to open the door.
1522 2018-02-01 20:56:14 It will once oil hits 80 and tanks to 70 then bamabroke will say see told ya so. Bamabrokedonkey

1525 2018-02-01 20:55:44 Took my car in for an oil change.  

Apparently my oil pan gasket is leaking ($700)
And my intake manifold gasket is leaking ($1000)
And my stabilizer links/pins are loose ($450)

I’m throwing this entire car away.
1526 2018-02-01 20:55:43 We need to diversify our economy regardless of the future prospect of crude oil. If we are out of recession because crude oil price has recovered, what happens when the price falls again?
1527 2018-02-01 20:55:23 Carrot Oil & avocado  Oil
1528 2018-02-01 20:55:19 Awesome. Time for an oil change and time to find a new place to get it done since I won’t go to Beaman anymore.

1530 2018-02-01 20:55:08 So I put oil in my hair for the night and now I have a headache GREAT
1531 2018-02-01 20:55:00 M not well neze i think castor oil is the way to go nou
1532 2018-02-01 20:54:59 I would highly recommend the "oil cleanse method" for the face. (commonly known now as OCM). Oils dissolve oils and are very effective for pulling dirt, bacteria, and other impurities from the face and pores. And don't fall for the "oils make your skin oily" nonsense.
1533 2018-02-01 20:54:43 This is where we have to agree to disagree.  Marijuana isn't a gateway drug. DUI charges still apply even where it is legal if they are driving under the influence. Just as any Rx med that may impair. See what CBD oil does for a child having seizure & you may change your mind
1534 2018-02-01 20:54:35 Refined oil? Sounds dangerous to me or do you mean upgraded?
1535 2018-02-01 20:54:34 Sometimes I don’t do certain things until Kent is here, like put air in my tires or change my oil, because I know how much he misses taking care of me.  #trueorfalse
1536 2018-02-01 20:54:32 That's exciting. Thinking about it though, oil has had 100+ years to develop efficient machines and well... they haven't #sustainability
1537 2018-02-01 20:54:15 Tell me why I'm getting an oil change at Walmart right and I walk around to buy some stuff. Some random hands me a gospel CD. I hate gospel. In favor of it being BHM I donated $5. He had to give me change for a $20 though
1538 2018-02-01 20:54:12 It's the Volume Scope at @InvestorRT .  This is BY FAR my favorite chart configuration.  I'm not a fan of @marketdelta that much to be honest.

Thanks - will look into impact of oil energy jobs.
1542 2018-02-01 20:53:40 Sugar, maltodextrin, rapeseed oil. I see no good here. You keep on pushing your “healthy lies”. One day the truth will become accepted about the false heart-Diet hypothesis. Let the lawsuits begin...
1543 2018-02-01 20:53:38 @thebestbond - more of that bad bad oil
1544 2018-02-01 20:53:30 Nothing will kill the middle class though like these rising oil and gas prices that seem to be steadily creeping up. We need to fix that ASAP. We got a good thing going, let’s not kill it.
1545 2018-02-01 20:53:27 Maybe they should work on training one of their 50 first overall draft picks first.

1553 2018-02-01 20:52:22 Time to wake up to what oil cures
1554 2018-02-01 20:52:19 So since going veg and using argan/manoi oil my skin looks so much more youthful and glowing
1555 2018-02-01 20:52:19 Les voleurs de gaz oïl on vraiment été emmerdes !
1556 2018-02-01 20:52:15 Crude oil is expensive that’s why by the gas is expensive. Blame Middle East if anything.
1557 2018-02-01 20:52:08 The issue is CON and LAB squandered it. Thatch pissed it up her wall of destroying coal, steel and industry. Cameron taxed it, which spooked oil cos who stopped investing in the NSB. Labour pissed it away all at once, mitigating Tory damage. No future, no investment. #totalfail

1568 2018-02-01 20:51:16 I don't know. But I do know that the people buying are most likely the zombies who just blindly buy commodities (mostly oil) when the dollar sees big down moves regardless of the situation of those commodities. I don't know who I hate more. The dirty bulls, or the zombies.
1569 2018-02-01 20:51:00 It's a win for the environment in 2 ways:
• Avoiding a 7-fold increase in tanker traffic reduces risk of a spill
• less of Alberta's per-barrel more carbon- and water-intensive oil makes it to market
1570 2018-02-01 20:50:43 I bought a new little bottle of tea tree oil yesterday and I’ve already used almost half. How 
1571 2018-02-01 20:50:24 @kaptainsunshine Global warming is the Trump #GOP legacy to be. But I refuse to kowtow to  monster. I will support green energy forever. These people are dinosaurs, oil sucking money sucking dignity sucking every ounce of good from the common man. I am NOT going to accept that.
1572 2018-02-01 20:50:20 just pay up and get that olive oil poppin
1573 2018-02-01 20:50:08 I see the threat on developing expensive oils like shale is Renewable energy solutions and Electric automobile industry. But, opportunity increased over high oil prices !. However, high price give more$$ to improve those threats once more!.

Predicament....
1574 2018-02-01 20:50:06 "Oil and water no worky"... I believe you must be referring to the trump / zinke offshore drilling proposal.
1575 2018-02-01 20:50:05 ALSO highly recommend a crystal nail file over a gritty one and I try use cuticle oil as often as possible! I forget a lot but I at least use it a few times a week & I use hand cream all the time for eczema so I guess that might help too
1576 2018-02-01 20:49:59 Didn’t know Tea Tree Oil was this strong
1577 2018-02-01 20:49:52 No dates when or if oil will flow through the completed line.Trying to pacify and deflect issues not solve them.
1578 2018-02-01 20:49:28 Great advice, you guys! Sage is an important and versatile essential oil, and these are great uses for it considering its properties.  Thanks for sharing this! :) #aromatherapy #essentialoils
1579 2018-02-01 20:49:21 when you do your next periscope can you talk about why on Wednesday there was that big move up on the bearish news. Obviously due to orderflow but i dont understand why they bought it on that news
1580 2018-02-01 20:49:14 Australia has started growing marijuana crops from the stock Israel cultivated to make oil for medicinal use it does not have the compound that makes you high but does have high levels of the stuff that works well for chronic pain, helps cancer patients, epilepsy & loads more

1584 2018-02-01 20:48:57 @PrakashJavdekar :From past few years,people from oil and gas sector are facing Job problem and that is  very serious issue but unfortunately no one is addressing this issue. No permanent jobs are available.
1585 2018-02-01 20:48:49 Did they do some new shenanigans with the dollar?
1586 2018-02-01 20:48:38 Brent crude rose by US76 cents to US$69.65 a barrel. The US Nymex price rose by US$1.07 or 1.7% to US$65.80 a barrel.

1588 2018-02-01 20:48:28 Ryan Zinke is out of control, a puppet to the oil and gas industry, a menace to the environment. He does not have the mandate ignore the public will. Turf him out.
1589 2018-02-01 20:48:28 each year, my car costs me 3,000+ for oil, inspection, tires & insurance. NOT including the 1,500+ i spend on gas each year. So, if your momma/daddy pay for your bills: count your fucking blessings.
1590 2018-02-01 20:48:24 i went to get my oil changed on my new car because the guy i bought the car from said that i should get it done and i did and the oil was perfect ok biggest car embarrassment ever

1593 2018-02-01 20:48:21 Alberta being stuck between BC and Quebec will be the death of our oil industry if we depend on pipelines! Building refineries is the way to go, retail products to those provinces and cut off royalties. They spend the royalty money importing resources from other countries anyway

1599 2018-02-01 20:47:49 Doubtful. But right about now it probably has that really cool old-car smell. You know, that mix of old leather, faint hint of oil, and dust.....
1600 2018-02-01 20:47:43 Truffle oil hahahaha
1601 2018-02-01 20:47:42 @kaptainsunshine Thank You Very Much For The Follow! I am a green energy lover. I just heard Trump is going to decrease green energy by %72. I am mystified why anyone hates green energy. But for Trump it's personal. He wants the oil money, and to quicken global warming.
1602 2018-02-01 20:47:26 ok cool I didn’t know it was ok to use coconut oil or not bc I’ve never used it on any of my tattoos before lol thank u

1604 2018-02-01 20:47:18 We need clean energy like wind and solar not oil and coal. Your making a big mistake and taking the us back 50 + years.

1619 2018-02-01 20:45:51 Currently oil rebenurs are negative uk - treasury giving £ to oil companies rather than other way round. Long way to go before oil revenues make positive contribution to treasury coffers

1621 2018-02-01 20:45:46 Don't forget about Omega-9s, incredibly important too! @Avohaus Extra Virgin Avocado Oil (Fruit Oil) is loaded with micronutrients, including Beta-Sitosterol and Vitamin E, high in Omega-9s!! Lowers Inflammation too!
1622 2018-02-01 20:45:44 Seriously #BC, are you and #Alberts not in the same country? Why stop  #KinderMorgan at this late stage? Is #Texas going to get #Canadian oil to market because BC is too stubborn? Only in #Canada do we stop trade for other Canadians.
1623 2018-02-01 20:45:43 Eww yes. Coconut oil is a pirate.
1624 2018-02-01 20:45:24 Took an amazon break Bc I almost bought $60 oil paper can someone please tell me if that’s the cost of that stuff
1625 2018-02-01 20:45:05 good!  Price of WTI hasn't been high enough to allow investment in oil infrastructure, much less new discoveries, etc.  Hope they re-tool to be better suited for shale light oil, further lessening our dependence on foreign sources.
1626 2018-02-01 20:45:01 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1627 2018-02-01 20:44:50 If it were left to the flat earth, global warming Neanderthals, oil production be further curtailed. @POTUS continues to unleash the trapped entrepreneurial urge that is the core of the American spirit of Liberty.

1628 2018-02-01 20:44:49 or a moving oil tanker?

1635 2018-02-01 20:44:23 Until people chose not use oil or oil related products then you can't block stuff because you don't want it in your backyard. If one has ever been part of the industry you'd understand it's not as the media makes it out to be.
1636 2018-02-01 20:44:09 do I buy weed... or castor oil... idk which one deserves my little 10 dollas more
1637 2018-02-01 20:44:04 don't forget Brazil and Canada when talking about huge new oil supply this year.

1650 2018-02-01 20:42:00 Rely on our mechanics for oil changes, auto repairs, and more.
1651 2018-02-01 20:41:59 I think it really started growing when I started using this shea moisture leave in conditioner w castor oil. Also they barely lightened me then dyed me magenta/bright purple lol
1652 2018-02-01 20:41:43 Olive Oil is afraid of no one,he just can’t play or is not ready for the tough guards on the NBA,he most likely is hanging out & collecting his million $’s paycheck than get beat up.Good gig if you can get it.Laker supporters stop this non-sense about Olive Oil,he needs his daddy
1653 2018-02-01 20:41:18 Yes I know distilled water does not conduct electricity, or at least not very well. I have never heard of submerging computers in oil, my mind unlike their fuses is blown!
1654 2018-02-01 20:41:18 You are 100% correct about olive oil. And with a last name like Staffaroni, I know a thing or two myself.

1656 2018-02-01 20:41:09 In space of a week, been stated that North sea oil & gas production will double over next few years and Scotch whisky alone accounts for almost a quarter of all UK food & drink exports. With Brexit disaster looming, sad to think some still against #indyref2
1657 2018-02-01 20:41:02 I’ve spoken with the dealership and they said my extended warranty for the oil consumption is up and I have to pay for repairs. However I never knew this oil consumption “recall” existed until yesterday. Ext. warranty ended 9/2015- didn’t start having issues until 10/2017.
1658 2018-02-01 20:40:33 What works well for my curls is the “Curls Blueberry Bliss Line” as far as moisturizer, and applications after the wash. “Aussie” is amazing for Conditioner and my oil is “Wild Growth Oil”
1659 2018-02-01 20:40:26 This would be a parallel situation if Okanagan residents or winemakers were particularly responsible for the BC NDP govt. Half the wineries of the region are oil-patch-retiree investments

1669 2018-02-01 20:39:08 Nunes’s behavior only makes sense in the context of the GOP wealthy donor network’s complicity. In terms of mathematical logic, look for the common denominator. I’m betting the common denominator is fossil fuel—oil, gas, coal, and the last gasp of a dying, antiquated technology.

1673 2018-02-01 20:38:30 It is bad to look see a "South South" guy and tell him to his face "Na your brothers wey dey blow oil pipelines no make us get light"

Also wrong to say "Fulani Herdsmen are killers"

Criminals are criminals. 

We shouldn't go the way of the Tutsis and Hutus.
1674 2018-02-01 20:38:25 You can do, very gently tho. I would just poach it with out searing, you can still wrap and tie it in bacon as well for extra flavour.
1675 2018-02-01 20:38:08 That is true, but it also shows that the oil companies have a large influence over the government for over a century, which is a dangerous situation for any goverment or corporation.
1676 2018-02-01 20:38:08 Tea tree oil is the same as chocolate-- it doesn't matter how """"pure""" it is, it's toxic to dogs, period.
1677 2018-02-01 20:38:03 I'm currently reading this online and it's an absolute blast to read... some great gems in here! 
"During the football season men should report on Sundays and given full body massages with warm olive oil."
1678 2018-02-01 20:37:58 I just left, I got a oil change
1679 2018-02-01 20:37:55 I’m concerned that you’ve been torturing yourself with peppermint oil lately. 
1680 2018-02-01 20:37:41 Yes. Today Norway is richer than the USA, has a social inclusive lifestyle, with universal healthcare, and a rent paid to all people from the oil sector, takes THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES yearly and is as progressive as all Scandinavian countries are. Who would like to emigrate here?
1681 2018-02-01 20:37:31 @Thedyer1971 hi was wondering if you could advise on a good cbd oil as I suffer from bad joint pain from time to time....thanks
1682 2018-02-01 20:37:06 I’m proposing cutting #cleanenergy funding by 72%, on top of placing tariffs on wind turbines to make wind less affordable. Why? Oil companies give me millions, & the #environment doesn’t give me a penny! And I won’t be around when it all goes to hell! So SCREW the environment!
1683 2018-02-01 20:37:04 How comes art supplies are so expensive? I have a BITCHIN idea for this Large Canvas but oil paints & impasto medium are,,,,, a Price for sure.

1689 2018-02-01 20:36:28 Any engine oil company you can think of makes gear lube.

The WD-40 is great for breaking the shit free, but you need some grease to keep it moving!
1690 2018-02-01 20:36:25 my husband would probably decide that would be a good time to check the oil....and rotate the tires maybe  
1691 2018-02-01 20:36:18 I just broke all the money i had save ughhhdjdkxllxl on a haircut, eyebrows, and oil change

1695 2018-02-01 20:35:41 Not really but its only three years old. The stupid apron chain needs tightened almost daily. The three gearboxes on the back all share the same oil so I guess its less checking but if one grenades they all get shrapnel I suppose.

1697 2018-02-01 20:35:37 This laughable article is incredulous! “Cathy Newman deluged with death threats”! Peterson dresses up misogyny in the woozy jargon of Eastern Religion”?  “Intellectual snake oil salesman”!  “He is a prophet for profit”. Wayda go Globe and Mail journalism at its finest 
1698 2018-02-01 20:35:35 Dr. Metcalf: “Give me an example of something that’s hydrophobic.”

1699 2018-02-01 20:35:34 Careful, Olive Oil.
1700 2018-02-01 20:35:29 It’s tricky tom, I do it my touch or by using a probe, your looking for about 58-64 degrees then rest it for 10-15mins I would say 15-20 mins in a pan just below simmer.
1701 2018-02-01 20:35:03 Thank you for pointing these things out. The real Americans who voted for @realDonaldTrump thinking he would some how save them, enrich them or improve their lives in some way are seeing the truth. They are seeing him for the snake oil salesman he truly aspires to be. #Impeach45
1702 2018-02-01 20:35:01 The Trump Administration’s proposal to dramatically ramp up offshore drilling could lead to 5,571 oil spills dumping 34.4 million gallons of oil into waters off Alaska, the West Coast, East Coast and Gulf of Mexico, according to a new Center for Biological Diversity analysis.
1703 2018-02-01 20:34:50 Ok so we are producing more oil than importing...so WTH with gas prices jumping from $2.17 to $2.59 in 13 days? No shortage of gas, and we have more oil...
1704 2018-02-01 20:34:29 Crude Oil higher on GS analyst:
- "...mkt has likely reached a balance between supply and demand"
- " Brent expected to be $80 this year"
Other:
- Some indep. refineries in China are buying crude oil to avoid tax changes coming in Mar
-OPEC producing +155k
-Crude +6MM
-Gas lower
1705 2018-02-01 20:34:14 Wall Street: "What rumors do we have in line for today? Ok, so we sell the fear speculations on a quarter of a percent interest rate reduction on the gold & oil supply & demand. Ok, let's hit the commodities in today's frenzy. Pull out those scripts & give them to the news girls"
1706 2018-02-01 20:34:12 Lowkey love getting oil changes .. love my lil honda
1707 2018-02-01 20:34:12 Is your oil appraised based on Man's standards or Gods? Are you considered to have a lighted lamp with oil burning or a lamp that's lost its flame based on Society's Standards?
1708 2018-02-01 20:34:06 No this is not correct actually. AFAIK  1 Petro is redeemable for a 1 barrel of oil (as long as they stick to that promise). This is perfect use case for block chain technology, it tokenizes oil making it tradable p2p and plugs crypto into the commodities markets via atomic swaps
1709 2018-02-01 20:34:04 #Soap is the oldest natural detergent. It has an anionic nature. It is produced by a chemical reaction between lye + a fatty acid or an oil.
1710 2018-02-01 20:33:52 I get it. I'm just saying It can be hard for a show to please people who want characters to have "fair stories" and people who want "more realism." Those two things are like Oil and Water. It can be hard to please both those groups of people at the same time, if not impossible.
1711 2018-02-01 20:33:47 The right wing believes you should just died, rather than suck off govt handsout. Only Big Oil, Wal-Mart, and other corporations that underpay their employees, deserve those handouts -er, "subsidies."
1712 2018-02-01 20:33:39 i looked and i couldnt see anything. I think it is probably due to the weather, my car is not used to this weather. But I am so paranoid. I just need to stop being lazy and take it to the mechanic, I also need an oil change.

1727 2018-02-01 20:32:13 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

1742 2018-02-01 20:29:42 Yet you use energy every single day . Lac magnetic was shipping oil laden with condensate in a tanker car not engineered to haul it. Do you know how tank farms are built. You need to educate yourself clearly you have no idea.
1743 2018-02-01 20:29:32 I cant believe i drank a cup of olive oil once
1744 2018-02-01 20:29:27 did they determine that if you apply oil and then hit it with a propane torch for precisely 36 seconds it perfectly simulates two years of slow cooking? do they do multiple layers?
1745 2018-02-01 20:29:20 They need to double their efforts. Let the Middle East oil dry up!
1746 2018-02-01 20:29:17 I used to do a whole bird as a pot roast. Tended to overcook. If poaching the crown, how long would you advise for an average size bird?
1747 2018-02-01 20:29:14 i wasn't referring to JT alone. one of the main purposes of the CLP (and specifically, putting a price on carbon) was to address the negative views of AB oil around the world. i would argue that it's done that. perhaps not as much as some people seem to expect

1763 2018-02-01 20:27:52 One thing I learned so far working in the oil patch is that stubble kind of acts like Velcro so on those especially breezy days, the ones where you question every choice you made in your career resulting in working in the oil patch in January, your toque won't fly off that easy.

1769 2018-02-01 20:27:16 I much prefer pheasant poached on the crown because of how lean it is, schnitzel or Kiev is a great way or instead of fried in bread crumbs it’s nice baked, coated in oats. Lovely wrapped in bacon as well to help with some fat.

 Page also met oil the giant Rosneft in 2016 during Trump campaign..
1775 2018-02-01 20:26:45 Oil & Gas covers plants with different functions, unlike the other categories. CCGT used for base-load are vastly cheaper than plants to meet demand spikes.
1776 2018-02-01 20:26:44 Companies with strong SPCC plans love them, as they typically have stronger cases against NOV’s if oil gets loose and it rains
1777 2018-02-01 20:26:42 Thought we might get a deeper pullback but as long as the dollar heads inexorably lower and gold heads higher, I am not sure how oil doesn't head higher too.

1782 2018-02-01 20:26:18 I suspect oil prices are being distorted by money supply.
1783 2018-02-01 20:26:13 Learn why russia is made an enemy first. They are the primary seller of oil and natural gas to europe. The queen wants to cut them out. That's the 40 year proxy war in the middle east in a nutshell, oil pipelines that russia doesn't own
1784 2018-02-01 20:26:12 Real bad strategy by BJP. Whose idea was it to increase MP salaries & then announce nothing for the middle class in Budget. Hope you have planned to recover from this. Oil prices needs to be under control as well. @AmitShah @narendramodi @BJP4India
1785 2018-02-01 20:26:08 Surely American interests and their local fascistic friends are hell-bent on destabilising the situation in Venezuela so that they can get their grubby mitts on some of that oil?
Whatever the cost in lives and misery.
1786 2018-02-01 20:25:59 Obviously you are not keeping up with reality. Suggest you walk with We the People and get facts and truth snake oil salesman as creepy and sleezy as POTUS
1787 2018-02-01 20:25:44 You're welcome! Thank you so much for spreading the word about the damage Trump's proposed offshore oil drilling plan could do to our coasts.
1788 2018-02-01 20:25:19 I congratulated myself on making brownies with applesauce sub for oil but now I've spent all day eating nothing but brownies.
1789 2018-02-01 20:25:18 sebulan 7k? kalau 12 bulan (1yr) mileage dh 84k. style Honda suggest mileage bg 1yr bersamaan dgn 20k; setiap 6 bulan 10k each & service pn 2 kali setahun jika menggunakan fully synthetic engile oil. kes Tuan ni setiap bulan service or 2 bulan sekali?
1790 2018-02-01 20:25:12 Only in Rick Perryland is crude oil = energy.
1791 2018-02-01 20:25:04 Scientists show links between earthquakes and oil and gas industry – in 2008 Oklahoma recorded one earthquake, in 2015 the number was 903
1792 2018-02-01 20:24:59 Not just CA. Oil per barrel is $65 right now. It was $45 six months ago. Need to get it back down or tax cuts are going down the drain.
1793 2018-02-01 20:24:38 The 6 inches I cut off December already grew back... yeah I’m bout to sell this oil recipe
1794 2018-02-01 20:24:26 don't forget India. Not sure how $100 oil by 3Q18 affect 2019 though...
1795 2018-02-01 20:24:23 But that disregards the bigger complaint I have of people tracking mud, oil, spit, dirt gum, shit, rain, mud etc from outside into the house. Dog hair is literally the least of my concerns.
1796 2018-02-01 20:23:59 Making huge plans without the money! Already wasted the advantage which govt got in last 3 years of record low crude oil price! Ineffective finance minister
1797 2018-02-01 20:23:50 Olive oil does my hair and skin soooo good
1798 2018-02-01 20:23:37 please come back soon
1799 2018-02-01 20:23:30 ok so like. i tried the batter with the olive oil and yea it has that olive oil like. smell but the batter was a lot richer than i remember box brownie batter being ?? idk i liked the flavor despite the weird olive smell
1800 2018-02-01 20:23:29 I would suggest our Vegan line of chocolates and confections = Coconut oil fats. Or our candied nuts. And everything we make is from scratch and uses butter and more butter.
1801 2018-02-01 20:23:29 This improves my respect of them, truly.  Trump is a festering boil on the country, and Paul Ryan is the rancid oil making it larger.

1803 2018-02-01 20:23:28 U.S. oil production surpassed 10 million barrels a day in November for the first time in nearly 50 years, a milestone that underscores the growing dominance of the U.S. oil industry.
1804 2018-02-01 20:23:16 Do I trust Venezuela? No. However Venezuela dose sell oil. countries might begin holding and trading it for oil. In that case I'd prefer holding Petro over dollars
1805 2018-02-01 20:23:07 Add vaseline on it or coconut oil or rubbing alcohol. Anything to dry it off. If not those options try freezing them with ice. :) hope I could help
1806 2018-02-01 20:23:07 I did and I don't like it but no it really don't bother me much. Nothing about money really interests me other than following money trails when need be.
That Fiat paper u call  is worthless backed by promises and projected labor of private citizens. Not backed by gold or oil...

1811 2018-02-01 20:22:19 Such an attractive proposition for an oil tycoon
1812 2018-02-01 20:22:18 How attractive is it watching the guys working on your oil change eat Wendy’s fries with oil and grease all over their hands 
1813 2018-02-01 20:22:16 Trump says he loves coal as a diversion so big oil proxy government won’t draw as much scrutiny. The United sheep of America are going exactly where big oil wants. Trumps praise of big oil & big auto in front of tillerson @ #SOTU couldn’t be more telling. H2FC’s now!
1814 2018-02-01 20:22:09 Thank you , much appreciated Tom
1815 2018-02-01 20:22:09 All popular trades are long oil right now. Oil base effects to fade in H2 this year (if unch. prices). And interestingly, Brent spot in EUR is up, but eg 60pos currently lowest since spring 2016. Inflation, really?
1816 2018-02-01 20:22:06 @PhillyPolice as someone who recently threw a plastic water bottle at somebody, who offered me it when i was thirsty, because “that shit ends up in the ocean, what kind of monster do you think i am?” I IMPLORE you.. please do not use gear oil on poles. It will end up in the water

1818 2018-02-01 20:22:04 So you're against all oil shipments. Guess we can experiment and stop shipping Vancouver gasoline and diesel.

1822 2018-02-01 20:21:29 Because a barrel of oil ia pegged to the value of the dollar
1823 2018-02-01 20:21:28 Damn. There's an oil that helps i can't remember the name but Nigerian women use it. One tablespoon and bam lol she'll be an Aquarian she's just waiting to get deeper into the month  and probably wants mommy and daddy to practice waiting on her. She is the princess after all

1825 2018-02-01 20:21:17 Its also a declaration that their about to use even more of Scotland's recent oil finds to fund it. Retweeted a comment from someone earlier that a builder has scoffed at 6 year time frame & said it would be more likely 25 years to fix.
1826 2018-02-01 20:21:14 Westminster means what it always has,  a democratic deficit, meaning a Govt Scotland rarely elects, refs that mean Yes means NO for EU membership, whatever is promised is eventually denied by Labour, Oil and exports are stolen as stealth taxation and Tories are always returned
1827 2018-02-01 20:21:11 If you have a lot of pheasant (8+ breasts), let me know, as I have the best terrine recipe ever.

1832 2018-02-01 20:20:49 UNLESS... nearby drains have oil/water separators? I’ve seen them before in Boston, not sure if they’re common in Philly though.

1834 2018-02-01 20:20:14 US crude oil/brent crude ends with strong gains Up over 1% on the day
The price of crude oil is ending the day with strong gains. 
The futures are closing at $65.80, up $1.07 or 1.65%. The high reached $65.91. The low extended to $64.63. The high price last week extended to …
1835 2018-02-01 20:20:08 I am holding the bag on CHK expecting oil and natty gas price increases to save the day, since I as a trader did not use a stop loss.  I won't puke but perhaps I will need to attend anger management classes.
1836 2018-02-01 20:20:07 Welcome 
1837 2018-02-01 20:19:35 Hi Atilla .. what do u think of the US dollar in the short to medium term and it's impact on commodities, especially Oil? Really appreciate your work.

1842 2018-02-01 20:19:15 Now I’ll be able to walk to get my olive oil
1843 2018-02-01 20:19:12 Is anyone here getting concerned about the rising cost for a barrel of oil. I think it may be time to pay attention to it . Does anyone agree ?

1852 2018-02-01 20:18:32 My stomach occasionally churns at certain varieties of solidified food-shaped oil found on American takeaway menus, but those pasta nachos look fine to me.
1853 2018-02-01 20:18:19 Nice idea. Hadn't thought of that. Lesley isn't fond of fried food, but I may try when she's out. Thanks.
1854 2018-02-01 20:18:17 Everything is normal with Mo`ikeha & feedings.  Early feedings are only a few drops of concentrated fish oil reserved in parent's stomach.  One of the 1st social skills chicks learn is not to beg from other parents.  All is OK
1855 2018-02-01 20:18:13 @JustinTrudeau U can't have it both ways: shipping tar sands oil thru BC AND keeping BC coast safe frm spills. ALL PIPELINES LEAK--it's just a matter of when. U can't be a #climate champion & approve new dirty tar sands pipelines! Look at all the Keystone leaks! NO #TransMountain

We already pay the most in Canada. Also, how are you going to get money for your diluted oil without B.C.?!?

1875 2018-02-01 20:15:01 When the 52 week high happened is irrelevant.

The point being that this huge oil discovery has not moved the share price up.

Now why would that be?

1911 2018-02-01 20:11:02 We're the same age (1963). High school 77 -81, I was there too, and I remember the oil squeeze and the Iranian hostages. The economy felt robust after Reagan got in, and it was for all appearances. But something dark is lurking in the background and it started then.

1920 2018-02-01 20:10:03 Very disappointed to see how badly Co-op rapeseed oil is rated. Switched to a more ethical olive oil last year and due to cost tried to find better general purpose veg oil.

1924 2018-02-01 20:09:42 You can try putting aquafor or Vaseline on top of your moisturizer too! And I use vitamin oil cause it helps with the redness. I'm always dry and flaky and coconut oil does tend to clog my pores if I use it every day

1938 2018-02-01 20:07:43 Bank positioning, sentiment and open interest suggest a lot of downside left for gold IMO. Any bounce in the dollar, and gold goes down fast - along with oil. Still, I've been saying dollar bounce for what seems like weeks now.

1946 2018-02-01 20:07:03 “Oh, but she’s a good manager.” Is she? She’s never run large legal office or major public entity. W this logic, do u bring oil exec, who’s good manager, to run EPA? Chief must have fundamental understanding on how to best rep the poor accused. if not, how know what’s efficient?

1952 2018-02-01 20:06:40 Us soldier at my school just awknowledged that interest in syria conflict is for oil not humanitarian reasons.

1953 2018-02-01 20:06:38 @RichieAllenShow Jim marrs spoke about the takeover of the middle East as nothing to do with oil or opium or politics but about ancient technology hidden there. Like the secrets of the Vatican. So much more to this reality then we can imagine
1954 2018-02-01 20:06:30 I really want a scentsy oil diffuser now that they are on sale.
1955 2018-02-01 20:06:27 Yep they start early here, first week of January in fact! About 5 species in flower already where I am. Toads are always good too! I look at everything so a nature walk is never boring. Saw skinks, Buzzards & dozens of oil beetles today too for example.
1956 2018-02-01 20:06:24 Well, industrial vats if you're a packaged goods blah blah. At home, it's usually in half-dozen batches in a wok, using canola or peanut oil

1970 2018-02-01 20:04:33 Probably not but it seems like gear oil would be more likely to drip & spread compared to Crisco... but the city gets slapped with so many slip & falls it probably doesn't matter either way.

2010 2018-02-01 20:02:32 Mainly due to exports that were legalized (under Obama by the way), and OPEC producing less oil (announced in 2016). US oil inventories now 77 million barrels lower than a year ago

2046 2018-02-01 19:59:33 I love vitamin E oil.  but I use mint on my face. Barely have any breakouts & if i do it’s rare. Mint is so faithful to me. Lol
2047 2018-02-01 19:58:59 There are no good billionaires for Russians. In 1991 they were all simple accountants, teachers, economists, and military men. None of them had a fortune of more than 10,000 dollars. The blessing of illegal privatization, they cleaned up oil, gas, metal, fertilizers.
2048 2018-02-01 19:58:51 Amen

2050 2018-02-01 19:58:19 Some of them believe those fairytales, but the vast majority are doubting the actual existence of a god ‘cause of all the crap they went through. America only cares about the oil, if there’s a change to be made it has to come from within.
2051 2018-02-01 19:58:16 Braids out. My hair needs a prayer and a hot oil treatment 
2052 2018-02-01 19:58:14 That oil is going to end up in the Delaware River. I wonder if that's legal.
2053 2018-02-01 19:57:53 @Senseispunk You're gonna take the roof off Lucas Oil. Watching you work while shooting 1-on-1s on the field during practice, it just wasn't fair. Congratulations
2054 2018-02-01 19:57:53 I hate this man doing my oil change! 
2055 2018-02-01 19:57:47 Nah they said it’s cause of the oil my car takes lol I do every 5 months
2056 2018-02-01 19:57:38 My chesticles are pumped to burst and I'm greased up all over with coconut oil.  

Going live on YouTube within the hour.
2057 2018-02-01 19:57:36 It's a dollar trade right now. It has very little to do with the reality of oil. Zombies are out and on the loose.
2058 2018-02-01 19:57:21 ah i know how that’s feels i had to get new tyres and they costed me $349 each rip and i needed to change the oil thing i hate how expensive cars are
2059 2018-02-01 19:57:15 Na so I hearam 
2060 2018-02-01 19:57:09 co worker bought me some coconut oil i couldn't be more happy lol
2061 2018-02-01 19:57:06 Carrot seed oil, vitamin e oil and even rose hip, those work for me. Argan oil works, but not on my face.  It's gunna be a big fat no for me.
2062 2018-02-01 19:57:02 So I read an review of someone putting castor oil on their eyebrows to grow them back 
2063 2018-02-01 19:56:58 Projection.
2064 2018-02-01 19:56:47 Extra virgin olive oil fulhi eh hifaigen
2065 2018-02-01 19:56:31 I use hairfood with coconut oil too
2066 2018-02-01 19:56:29 3yrs in govt and how many politicians have been tried and convicted 4 corruption, even in his own govt, self sufficiency and he is increasingly looking 4 more oil in the North, so much for diversification, unity and keeps turning blind eye to herdsmen menace
2067 2018-02-01 19:56:21 Duh, the FBI is making it VERY difficult for the @HouseGOP, @SenateGOP and cabinet to collect billions in RUS oil $$.
2068 2018-02-01 19:56:18 The last month, oil prices are not rising/falling because of supply and demand. It's mostly a dollar trade right now. Enjoy 2018.
2069 2018-02-01 19:56:17 Just at airport gas and oil my theory is he ran out of heating fuel so he had to drink to get warm and then found a dd to take him to get some heating oil lol
2070 2018-02-01 19:56:13 Let's state the obvious. Very high added value goods will be less affected by Gravity. Mobile phone/ARM chip designs, top end Jet engines, pharmaceuticals. Commodities like grain or oil will be dominated by Gravity. People businesses like finance will be somewhat affected?
2071 2018-02-01 19:56:08 Wait for it. Real love is like coconut oil on your body and soul...it gives instead of taking, fills instead of emptying, teaches, learns, helps you grow...
2072 2018-02-01 19:56:06 It will never happen oil and other fossil fuel is what makes the world go around communist Bernie. Just think if we stopped using oil. Your wife wouldn’t have any make up to cover her ugly face.

2074 2018-02-01 19:55:50 You see...I was due up for an oil change in my car. So I changed it
2075 2018-02-01 19:55:40 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
2076 2018-02-01 19:55:30 Is this magnificent animal the reason trump wants to remove regs protecting the wild mustangs in the American west or does an oil company need access to the lands the horses still occupy
2077 2018-02-01 19:55:27 Yep, there's seems to be a lot of snake oil and hype men in the way! It will become a significant tool of commerce, supply chain surety etc, but for now it's being treated like some sort of gold rush.
2078 2018-02-01 19:55:27 They will say its fake statistics. Neilson ratings are fake. All they care abt is Stocks, oil and "clean coal" Narcissists dont care about truth
2079 2018-02-01 19:55:06 I don't doubt that getting the oil is a factor in some of it. But it just seems like a big leap and I don't know how you can be confident you're leaping in the right direction, if you know what I mean
2080 2018-02-01 19:54:55 Here's Trey Gowdy's chance if true.
Bulldog or Chihuahua?
2081 2018-02-01 19:54:53 Short position since Jan 11th. Bored but it's worthy. The low volume bounce from 9200 was a clear bad sign. FUD afterwards are just oil on the flame. $BTC
2082 2018-02-01 19:54:48 I feel really strongly upon this topic, as I am passionate about the ocean. This large of an oil spill in the ocean could cause dramatic effects on the plant and animal life in the ocean. I think as a population, we should be doing more to prevent this tragedy from occurring.
2083 2018-02-01 19:54:43 The state has no money because oil is cheaper now. Tough to say what his electoral position will be -- depends in part on whether any Dem actually runs (e.g. Begich) or if he's the de facto Dem.
2084 2018-02-01 19:54:36 Why do non US countries buy oil in dollars
2085 2018-02-01 19:54:12 Thats it for writing today, just in time for.#AmazingSpaces & #CBB .

2086 2018-02-01 19:54:10 me this morning, feb 1st: gonna save all my money this month let’s get it

pep boy guy this afternoon, feb 1st: “ma’am there’s a nail in your tire and your others are about to blow, but hey we changed your oil!”
2087 2018-02-01 19:54:07 I got the perfect oil rn hehe
2088 2018-02-01 19:54:05 Bruh u getting ripped off lol I get my oil change every 3 months
2089 2018-02-01 19:53:58 I use peppermint oil around the hairline. There are some days I go from barely having my eyes open to having them fully open in about 5 minutes!
2090 2018-02-01 19:53:57 Im getting smoked right now haha. Honestly as bonds are going to shit, pretty sure the market is next - people seem to be oblivious right now. Hoping oil collapses first, so I can short the SPY or something, but it seems everything is going parabolic together.
2091 2018-02-01 19:53:52 You city bindippers are like Trump supporters! You can't reason with stupid! Fake club with oil money, yet smaller fanbase than villa
2092 2018-02-01 19:53:52 MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY...MON-EY.RUSSIAN OIL MONEY!Trumputin IOU s that will be made good on to all cooperating bad actors. Rex and Trump letting spy heads in,only THEY could do. Rex stinks of Exxon like Trump does of Tide money launder detergent.
2093 2018-02-01 19:53:50 THANK YOU @Alex_S_Morgan for the recommendation of coconut oil for soothing relief caused by post-anal-play irritation. Oh man, what a relief. 

Neosporin, I’m sorry, but the all-natural solution kicks your chemical butt.
2094 2018-02-01 19:53:43 I love you toooo! I was going to make us some olive oil. (Watch bong appetite!! It’s on Hulu it’s the best)  one tablespoon is 25mg of thc:)
2095 2018-02-01 19:53:37 Ur mcm uses bio oil on his face as moisturiser.
2096 2018-02-01 19:53:35 Castor oil. Also sulfur8 is good
2097 2018-02-01 19:53:30 I’m not going to disagree that the oil patch has done Canada good, but the question stands.
How would you, and Alberta as a whole, compensate BC for such a Disastrous spill?
2098 2018-02-01 19:53:14 January 2018 has probably been my most productive month ever. 
Renew passport 
Schedule removal of wisdom teeth 
Get new prescription for glasses 
Make a life changing decision  
Get my oil changed 
2099 2018-02-01 19:52:56 I'm past caring football has lost me. sky coverage getting excited by most expensive signings is perverse. I hope the whole bubble bursts.sooner we realise it needs  2be sustainable the better we can't all be oil baron owned mega clubs. Remember our roots n where we came from
2100 2018-02-01 19:52:34 OH wow you didnt tell me it was the high quality of LITTLE CESARS®! I'll do it for 1 piece and a stack of napkins (i put them in my car with a little oil on it for good scent. Hope its got the new logo on them! thank u for opportunity sir i know youre not taking advantage of me!
2101 2018-02-01 19:52:27 4C, I mostly use coconut oil... I barely treat my hair tbh
2102 2018-02-01 19:52:16 Except to destroy our planet and our children in order to enrich coal and oil oligarchs.
2103 2018-02-01 19:52:09 I'm trying to get my skin better and I feel like I'd be further along if I had a regimen for night. I don't normally wear makeup so I'm less diligent about washing my face at night. I usually just use a couple of cleansing wipes for the excess oil and go to sleep.
2104 2018-02-01 19:52:04 Hate to break it to you but it looks like it’s deep fried in a swimming pool of oil
2105 2018-02-01 19:51:46 Well, whatever’s up with my car, it’s not because of low oil.  Here’s to hoping it’s nothing too serious once I get the code from the OBD-II reader later...

2109 2018-02-01 19:50:43 coconut oil is the shit 
2110 2018-02-01 19:50:31 Lmaooo we both know without oil money y’all would be shit

2113 2018-02-01 19:50:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2114 2018-02-01 19:50:01 They are working very hard to get my out of my short gold and oil positions as well as my long dollar position. I think I'm just not going to open my account up for like a week or until someone pings me haha.
2115 2018-02-01 19:49:57 Oil future, wheat futures are not made out of thin air and very important! It a contract to buy or sell at a fix date vs spot market where you buy immediately. Guess how airlines would struggle without oil futures! Internet also didn’t replace banks - blockchain may survive
2116 2018-02-01 19:49:50 I was going to tell a joke about oil, but I was told it was too crude
2117 2018-02-01 19:49:25 Alright ladies and gents, we have a slightly different time today, why? CAUSE THIS GOT DAMN OIL CHANGE IS TAKING FOREVER... So, I'm thinking 2pm pst.
2118 2018-02-01 19:49:10 "The price of oil for Nigeria today is a double edged sword. So, every dollar that goes up, we get more revenue but also because we are importing refined petroleum, increases the landing cost of fuel.”
2119 2018-02-01 19:49:10 They DO sell it to make ends meet and meanwhile execs and lobbyists like Tony reap all the real profits while sellers just try to pay off their DEBTS they took on in useless snake oil product. A 'Trump University' for CA Latinos. Shame.

2125 2018-02-01 19:48:51 i’m getting my oil changed & the guy that’s working on my car comes back in & goes “ur car smells v good” then tries to say stoners have the best time together like boy go fix my car so i can get to my boo safe n sound thank uuuu
2126 2018-02-01 19:48:47 You,ll grow old still moaning "oil money FC"

Learn to live with it..
2127 2018-02-01 19:48:45 didn’t get an oil change lol
2128 2018-02-01 19:48:45 Although I always like it when the grill is clean, it leaves a pool of oil and a brown sponge every time.
2129 2018-02-01 19:48:28 Everyday when I do my hair properly I stand there for a second like "fk it no one else does I'm not!!!! Doing!!!! It today!!!!"............. then I pick up my sock bun and hair oil and get it done
2130 2018-02-01 19:48:24 People are over using diffusers. They were just a money maker. A bit of lemon oil and orange in a pot of water on the stove is good. American consumers just have no common sense.
2131 2018-02-01 19:48:21 “Come and buy the new snake oil”
2132 2018-02-01 19:48:07 Hey there ! How about a little freshly chopped Tarragon , garlic ,cracked black pepper , maldon salt fresh lemon juice / zest from a micro plane grater and a splash of virgin olive oil !! Mix in a bowl put the scored chicken in the bowl and cover for an hour /grill or roast 
2133 2018-02-01 19:48:04 omg my dad puts our cooking oil in a spray bottle. it’s ten times easier to coat a pan #lifehacks
2134 2018-02-01 19:47:59 I don't need to here about your bikini line, will you oil your beard though
2135 2018-02-01 19:47:48 Honestly have you tried ecostyler, it’s a gel but if you get one with aloe or olive oil and lightly use it it hold the shape and moisturizes
2136 2018-02-01 19:47:45 Things I've learned about cooking:
-- Recipes lie, a lot: the time needed, and the amount of oil/butter needed are much greater than listed in most recipes.
2137 2018-02-01 19:47:41 @ICE.gov@PresidentLadyFitzgerladKennedy: As The Head of The Academy, I am appointing Chaney for my Administration as a man that is an enterpenure that I voted for, and he knows the oil buinsess and I honor him for endorsing me. Thank you.
2138 2018-02-01 19:47:35 When you have awesome coworkers who help you get your hood on your car open, to put oil in it so your car doesn’t die on you... yep that’s me!

2140 2018-02-01 19:47:29 I honestly don't think that climbing on light poles would be that big of an issue if Philadelphia would just ignore it. Putting oil on them is a clear challenge to Eagles fans
2141 2018-02-01 19:47:28 I replaced my oil like 2-3 weeks ago. Fixed a slight leak. Now it's leaking again and it makes me wanna fucking die. This shit has a problem every week. I replaced the battery less than 2 weeks ago because it suddenly died!
2142 2018-02-01 19:47:23 I love how he's not even protesting to the fact that Grayson said he needed to shave him.. lol next tweet will be.... "he says he needs to oil me up.. Wft.."  
2143 2018-02-01 19:47:20 I can fall asleep so easily with this lavender oil essence omg  I’ve been struggling with falling asleep a lot but this!!! is the best, everyone who struggle with it you need to try this out
2144 2018-02-01 19:47:18 Come in for a damn oil change & leaving with other shit  it rlly has been a while so i guess betsy needs it
2145 2018-02-01 19:47:11 Mineral oil cooling
Nothing special...
2146 2018-02-01 19:46:41 nah haha I slathered it in coconut oil first and made sure to not leave the bleach in too long
2147 2018-02-01 19:46:32 Nope, I'll just switch my investments to oil companies and generator retailers - oh, and gun manufacturers. 
2148 2018-02-01 19:46:01 Another Oil  Boom?
2149 2018-02-01 19:45:45 So why is it taking them forever to change my oil and my car the only one out there 
2150 2018-02-01 19:45:38 #MyFirstVehicleWas was filled with oil more often than gas, spent about a third of every month getting repairs ate every cent I made
2151 2018-02-01 19:45:36 It better be a good wall. We have enough oil to burn it down and lots of construction/destruction equipment with Alberta license plates.
2152 2018-02-01 19:45:32 Try a dash of soy sauce (just a dash), chili pepper powder, maybe some garlic powder, a couple dashes of fish or oyster sauce, drop of sesame oil or a sprinkle of sesame seeds, a few chopped green onions, and a spoonful of chunky peanut butter dissolved in the broth. :)
2153 2018-02-01 19:45:29 If liberals cared would they stay silent as Obama enabled Iran to become nuclear?  Nuclear testing worse for ocean then 100 oil spills. Overpopulation in Africa, S America likely No1 worst environmental issue liberals studiously ignore. Cherry picking issues proves its politics.
2154 2018-02-01 19:45:23 Ever since I started using coconut oil as eyemakeupremover my lashes have gotten longgggeerrrr #holla
2155 2018-02-01 19:44:59 and mix with raw onions and olive oil and let it refrigerate mix salt if needed and enjoy as an accompaniment it’s a Spanish side accompaniment like the kimchi of Korea and it’s called ensalada de criolla
2156 2018-02-01 19:44:54 Buy a container of coconut oil. It’s life changing...
2157 2018-02-01 19:44:53 Oil / Big Pharma / Big Ag
2158 2018-02-01 19:44:49 I've always liked spicy foods, weirdly enough. It helps that hot chili oil tastes /really good/ with savory and salty foods.
2159 2018-02-01 19:44:41 Oil oil oil !!!!!
2160 2018-02-01 19:44:21 Garlic bread solution: use chopped garlic and oil instead and blend!!! It's still super nice especially on soft bread 
2161 2018-02-01 19:44:17 Might better worry about a massive oil spill off our coast once the oil companies start drilling.
2162 2018-02-01 19:44:15 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr as the rest of the world moves FORWARD with renewable energy-, the GOP takes America back in time to fossil fuels all to appease the oil and dying coal industries. Beyond pathetic

2175 2018-02-01 19:42:28 Venezuela has the largest proven reserves of oil. That is the only reason the US gives a damn about it.
2176 2018-02-01 19:42:21 Show me! And where did you get your balsamic? I'm drinking the contents of the bottle so I can bring it home for rapeseed oil  Well that's my excuse tonight 
2177 2018-02-01 19:42:21 @kateblair4 Hi Kate, Is there a facilities manager for the Kenai Refinery we could check in with? Our archaea formula would be a very cheap, effective & efficient solution to completely remediate the spilled oil. Wouldn’t harm the equipment if used to clean the tanks, too.
2178 2018-02-01 19:42:15 I asked my dad to do an oil change for my car. And when it was done I got in and saw he cleaned my whole car & vacuumed it 
2179 2018-02-01 19:42:15 I take black elderberry syrup (found at health food stores) when I feel like I’m getting sick or when I’m sick to shorten the duration. I swear by that stuff! Also oil of oregano capsules are supposed to be good for you and B12!
2180 2018-02-01 19:42:10 Russian oil money is in the mix. No doubt

2185 2018-02-01 19:41:36 @jasonnash @DavidDobrik Look in the ingredients in McDonald’s fries. It just says potatoes and oil so I made french fries using the same type of potatoes and the same type of oil and let the  McDonald’s fries and my fries sit out to which ones went rotten first.
2186 2018-02-01 19:41:34 And oil executives.  It is very odd none of them have much grasp of English grammar. Or any other kind.

2188 2018-02-01 19:41:13 Called my sister to come take me to the hospital due to an irregular heart beat & I keep smelling oil sheen ....we’ve been on the phone an hr now 
2189 2018-02-01 19:40:54 But there's more than one way to connect the dots. Couldn't it be that people are taking advantage of the existing situation with ISIS etc to get the oil without it being specifically coordinated by a society of elites? I'm just not sure how you choose one explanation over others

2311 2018-02-01 19:25:10 Dude your entire argument rests on top of two decades of big oil propaganda
It's the ONLY reason you doubt the science, whether you realize it or not

But if I'm wrong perhaps you could tell me of other mainstream scientific principles you disagree with?
2312 2018-02-01 19:24:50 Do most Canadians support an oil pipeline through the Rockies and to the BC coast?
2313 2018-02-01 19:24:46 spare us you POS as just last week you accused him of doing drugs and being a snake oil salesman - you and @AlexReimer1 need to curl up in a ball and go far away

2319 2018-02-01 19:24:18 Oh, this is so disgusting. He and his Big Oil cronies KNOW perfectly well how dirty fossil fuels are, and that we only have one planet. They KNOW how dangerous coal mining is. But they do this anyway; selling out the earth itself, and people’s lives, for profit. Filthy!

2324 2018-02-01 19:23:42 Season and oil the meat, not the pan. Make sure the pan is smoking hot before you put the steak in. It shouldn’t take long depending on how you want it cooked. Should only need turning twice.

2335 2018-02-01 19:22:14 I don't get it. On the one hand safflower, sunflower &  peanut oil bad because they have lots of PUFAs. On the other hand you don't think evaluating vegetable oil use in LEAN NAFLD would be useful, seeing if PUFA consumption is high 
& testing effect of lower PUFAs?

2356 2018-02-01 19:19:09 That's how people in the oil and gas industry understand it (and it is an oil and gas industry article that's linked at the top of this). I suggest you use the internet to educate yourself a bit instead of using it to spread your ignorance.
2357 2018-02-01 19:19:00 Then why in the hell is gas going up almost weekly. A month ago in my are it was $2.13 a gallon. Now nearly$2.60 . And we have more oil in the reserve than ever
2358 2018-02-01 19:18:59 Vegetable oil is too runny.
2359 2018-02-01 19:18:47 That was an adorable video!!  I couldn't help but wonder how they cleaned olive oil off his hands!!
2360 2018-02-01 19:18:35 For all my natural hair women, what are y’all views and opinions on castor oil ?
2361 2018-02-01 19:18:25 Oil will stay put. Shale break-even is 40$/barrel now. Can't go too much up.
2362 2018-02-01 19:18:03 We should observe the pattern specially after Kabul attacks some ANA serving officers on social media are threatening there will be attacks in Pakistan soon.We should be alerted and beef up security specially in Karachi around oil storage facilities, US consulate, Wah Ord fac etc

2364 2018-02-01 19:17:37 Its a method where you put oils on your face and wash them off to remove excess sebum and oil from your face.What you do is apply a mixture of oils,I use coconut oil and tea tree oil(love this mixture coz it helps with removing make up as well.
Then what I do is rub it on my face
2365 2018-02-01 19:17:16 It was so bizarre, like an old time snake oil salesman.  Nothing uplifting about it.
2366 2018-02-01 19:16:53 Inject concrete after pulling out oil. Keeps plates from slipping.

2375 2018-02-01 19:15:57 Faster SSD. This is about the only thing that can be upgraded without being an oil tycoon, at least until the RAM prices come down to sane levels, and GPU price gouging ends.
2376 2018-02-01 19:15:54 Rip off the bandaid and shine light on this. Seperate good from bad and move on. Covering further increases public mistrust. Hiding what?
2377 2018-02-01 19:15:54 I understand& respect the fact media has a job to do but let's be serious here. What riveting quote is Montoya going to give? Only thing more useless than morning skate interviews are intermission hits. Go cover MLB & try talking to most  starting pitchers. #Oilers

2446 2018-02-01 19:09:51 These will be refined into fish oil, packed into tablets that you can swallow ceremoniously to stave off the horrible consequences of all your other bad habits.
2447 2018-02-01 19:09:41 I ran a ton of errands, did some reading, got an oil change and cut my own hair all before class today 
2448 2018-02-01 19:09:37 Good for you! Get incentives for coastal cities/states to create green energy projects in tandem with off-shore drilling where each platform has dedicated vessels to skim oil spills.
2449 2018-02-01 19:09:21 @almosteducate Here's the thing with 3D movies, re: your Snake Oil episode.  Theatres give the best times to 3D movies. I don't think it's about people falling for 3D Movies as a con, it's that they're forced into it.
2450 2018-02-01 19:09:17 The trouble with 'celebrating' each new massive oil/gas find, is that it makes Westminster even more determined that we should never be let go. #DoubleEdgedSword
2451 2018-02-01 19:09:10 So I put garlic in pan without any oil then went to toilet (it burnt). My Aunty Vic came downstairs 20 minutes later from doing her hair saying her straighteners are broken and smell like garlic  this house kills me
2452 2018-02-01 19:09:08 On the schedule today: dental appointment, living trust paperwork, oil change. Adulthood is this long game of UNO where entropy is just gleefully waiting to drop a wild card.
2453 2018-02-01 19:09:08 what with the 5 litres of olive oil !!! are you expecting 50 guests ???
2454 2018-02-01 19:09:00 9.Just like the debate about how gainful the discovery of oil is to Nigeria, you’ll be tempted to ask if social media is a blessing or a curse when you imagine its application by our young folks. #Fit4Purpose
2455 2018-02-01 19:09:00 Excess crude oil
2456 2018-02-01 19:08:53 Lol, right! Completely misplaced outrage. I want a gift card from the oil companies before every long weekend!
2457 2018-02-01 19:08:48 Yeah, those paint strokes are authentic 1400 oil
2458 2018-02-01 19:08:45 Makes me wonder sometimes. You hit it on the head. He ain't no oil painting and so far zero personality, where she is full of life and excitement. He needs to get over himself, let loose and enjoy her company. Allow and open up himself to her instead of whinning.
2459 2018-02-01 19:08:39 Please share details on how dilbit can be cleaned up. if u can't find these in the 'thorough examination' you are citing, Enbridge (Michigan) and Husky Oil (Noth Sask River) may  have some insights to share...

2461 2018-02-01 19:08:36 Oh for sure but tgey are having to change oil every race. Put 2 to 3 clutches in a season. Probably do at least one or two top ends especially if they are running a modded 250f which this bike is aiming against. Plus cost of gas, filter oil, 3 to 4 air filters. Now its more even

2465 2018-02-01 19:07:53 This is a ridiculous response. So many epileptic chdren in North America have seen amazing results with cdb oil. Not to try it on Alfie is unconscionable
2466 2018-02-01 19:07:48 Doesn't get prosecution for poisoning a river system why not weaponize them they can only do more damage, just like Mr. deregulation Trump and all are going to love the oil Derek's just offshore( not Florida), you won't be able to swim or surf anyways cause of the pollution.
2467 2018-02-01 19:07:23 Quite sickening...It's like a challenge..The great thing is,all our bad deeds have consequences.Those are the same girls who pour hot cooking oil on their men when they find out they are cheating smh
2468 2018-02-01 19:07:04 The best memory of all is that I was feverishly working from said Starbucks in London during a huge launch for my then employer @SoftwareAdvice, while the amazing @aliciamdown, @renepants, @Rbellovin (+crew) burned the midnight oil back in Austin... miss you guys <3 #FRQlaunch

2476 2018-02-01 19:06:22 A full tank of oil and a primed boiler. Nice to have hot water and heating after 5 days.
2477 2018-02-01 19:06:20 Never buying the eco styler with olive oil again.  I have been converted.
2478 2018-02-01 19:06:09 What? Even if you live in a West African village and the palm oil comes from your neighbour's mixed cropping farm #justsaying
2479 2018-02-01 19:05:54 This oil looks so beautiful 
2480 2018-02-01 19:05:51 Why? Why is it “far left” to listen to science? We could have been much further along with renewable energy, but for the the almighty oil companies.

2483 2018-02-01 19:05:43 nothing is more irrational to me than how good olive oil, lemon and salt can make roasted broccoli taste
2484 2018-02-01 19:05:33 I just make oil and vinegar salads! Much better tasting in my opinion and I actually like vinegar
2485 2018-02-01 19:05:24 cannot wait for my hols n to get absolutely sizzled!!!! Cocktail in one hand, carrot oil in the other

2494 2018-02-01 19:04:36 I use Trader Joe's cleansing oil, then follow-up with a face wash. It gets every last ounce of makeup, even eye makeup.
2495 2018-02-01 19:04:36 The reality of what happens on oil palm plantations is very different to Pepsi’s fun, sexy, greenwashing advertising campaigns.

Pepsi’s conflict palm oil is driving rainforest destruction and the extinction of already endangered animals like orangutans, tigers, and elephants.
2496 2018-02-01 19:04:34 Our influence with Saudi Arabia... They have what we need. Oil. That’s the basis of our relationship with the Saudis. Does it go beyond that? Yes. Weapons deals. And because of those large financially driven ties, we play tit for tat with them, scratching each other’s backs.

2504 2018-02-01 19:03:30 Oil subsidy bill will go up. That's all.

2508 2018-02-01 19:03:16 Yeah. It takes a few weeks to transition but then your scalp starts to regulate how much oil you need leading to silky soft shiny hair! I give it a good rinse about once a week. Scents massaged thru hair if desired.

2520 2018-02-01 19:01:34 So get your priorities straight.  Do you have fire & ambulance?  Get those first.

Then, stop depending on the RCMP to do contract policing, and use your oil revenues to start a provincial police force that will deal with your issues.

And stop shooting volunteer firefighters.
2521 2018-02-01 19:01:12 Sat for 45 minutes watching cat videos while waiting on my oil to be changed. What a wonderful Thursday
2522 2018-02-01 19:01:10 Oil wants to be free!
2523 2018-02-01 19:01:10 Sucking out all that thick oil will leave a hollow space under the earth. No wonder the earth shakes to fill those gaps. The ground will fall from beneath our feet.

2535 2018-02-01 18:59:59 I think 2 is an antecedent of 3, though. If you've spent a lifetime trying to disenfranchise sick people, it's a pretty straight line from that disenfranchisement to distrust of the system. Snake oil isn't unique to the US, but it certainly has the right conditions to flourish.

2552 2018-02-01 18:57:05 Clean energy is, perhaps, the fastest growing global industry ... Trump is killing job opportunities for Americans (mostly in red states where solar is hot) & killing investment opportunities for his precious 1 percenters. But hey that’s okay as long as Putin & Exxon can sell oil

2554 2018-02-01 18:56:55 The CIA and Egyptian Mukhabarat project failed in South Sudan.  Only result became deep poverty, insecurity, and hunger for the South Sudanese people.

2578 2018-02-01 18:54:15 Well they still don’t have oil cooking!and still poverty!
2579 2018-02-01 18:54:12 I received my 1099 from Twitch but I have some questions. For example: what is this section for “royalties”? It says ‘oil, gas, or mineral properties’ on the back. Huh? What’s the best resource for Twitch tax filing?
2580 2018-02-01 18:54:12 Energy density. Come up with something that puts out the energy of a barrel of oil and our society shall keep humming along. Without a suitable replacement, transitioning us off of oil will lead us to badness. Starting with the poorest among us. Transition is a ways off yet.
2581 2018-02-01 18:54:09 Can y’all stop cooking in coconut oil? It is NOT HEALTHY. Sincerely, a concerned Dietitian
2582 2018-02-01 18:54:07 Lunchtime.  Plenty of pork sausage, potatoes, olive oil.

Simple, tasty and politically motivated.
2583 2018-02-01 18:54:03 Coconut oil issa no for me
2584 2018-02-01 18:53:56 "Beautifully crafted pan. The ceramic coating makes it truly a non stick pan. There is no need to add any oil or butter. The pan retains heat evenly." #happycustomer #cookware #ceramiccookware
2585 2018-02-01 18:53:53 1974 Pinto. Standard transmission. No functional A/C.  I got it in 1979. Burned oil, seatbelts didn't work.  I loved that stupid car, until it died.
2586 2018-02-01 18:53:45 Extra virgin olive oil on errthang
2587 2018-02-01 18:53:42 Drove through Utah and Stopped at Escalante.Wondrous!The only reason USA still Has Such Miracles is because those before US Kept Them Safe from Exactly what tRump wants to do.There's NO Oil Shortage!Sell USA Off Cheap to 1%=LOSS.These National Parks Belong to US. #TheResistance
2588 2018-02-01 18:53:32 remember when harry said that he has black coffee with coconut oil and butter for breakfast? like how does he get away with that but i get called tasteless?
2589 2018-02-01 18:53:21 If you really want to see good change in lives of non-whites, you should field only non-white candidates FROM ALL PARTIES. Dem or Rep they are parties of white people and won't give anything to non-whites.
All ppl of color should vote 4 non-white candidates only. DM me 4 in-depth

2592 2018-02-01 18:52:31 You have to change the oil in it too, don't want er' gettin' clogged up.
2593 2018-02-01 18:52:18 Is that oil painting

2595 2018-02-01 18:52:13 Definitely true in some cases - just very hard to see any win-wins w/that base on environment/energy. They either don't care, or are hard-line convinced that what's good for oil/coal/mining is good for them & that enviro claims are false.
2596 2018-02-01 18:52:12 Either you believe we need to stop burning oil and coal asap, or you don't.
2597 2018-02-01 18:52:11 they sold the last pot of Nuln Oil in Nottingham?
2598 2018-02-01 18:51:38 "The Syrian economy is at a standstill and now the United States wants to lop off northern Syria and place it under an independent-ish Kurdish state, which has 50 percent of Syria’s oil and gas.
2599 2018-02-01 18:51:33 @cgy_guy being pro oil isn't pro Canada. It's pro money.

Also I am pro Canada but not at the expense of our environment and oceans.
2600 2018-02-01 18:51:19 I’m sacrificing my lunch break to get my car’s oil changed...this is the most “adult” decision I’ve made since switching to skim milk.
2601 2018-02-01 18:51:13 *Checks his car into Tire Discounters*

*takes mechanic 50 minutes to pull it into the bay*

It's only a oil change/rotation, but it's the anxiety of getting to work on time.
2602 2018-02-01 18:51:10 O oil Man ao vivo Aqui mano mds é meu dia de sorte
2603 2018-02-01 18:51:01 So what? Trump says to oil buddy, want drilling in ANWR, ok. Want to bring back fossil fuels? Ok, I’ll cut everything else. Want less workplace safety rules? Ok. It’s all about money and that’s pathetic.
2604 2018-02-01 18:51:00 me, home alone with the cats: 

hey kids wanna see dad make a really shitty cake? I know we don't have measuring cups but im sure i can guess how much 1 1/4 cup of water and 1/3 cup of oil is. lets find out.
2605 2018-02-01 18:50:57 Go to the damn doctor.
2606 2018-02-01 18:50:45 Cous-cous, chicken, peas, sweetcorn, broccoli, asparagus. All very healthy! Even fried eggs are healthier than you think, because they only cook in the oil, they don't absorb it... apparently.
2607 2018-02-01 18:50:43 I have a killer headache and no access to advil atm, but my buddy hooked it up with some peppermint oil.
2608 2018-02-01 18:50:37 He brought his own olive oil! It’s the most.
2609 2018-02-01 18:50:36 If we are producing that much oil why are gas prices skyrocketing in CA?
2610 2018-02-01 18:50:32 @GovernorKayIvey @AGSteveMarshall   Request exemption from Trump's Offshore Plan. Protect Gulf. 

The Center for Biological Diversity has crunched the numbers: Trump's proposal to dramatically ramp up offshore drilling could lead to 5,571 oil spills dumping 34.4 million gallons.
2611 2018-02-01 18:50:29 Selling oil to the enemy like his namesake? ( Nazis in WW2)
2612 2018-02-01 18:50:28 You owe 5 grand already and a few hundred means more than possibly dying?  
I would rather be alive, in debt than dead and debt free
2613 2018-02-01 18:50:24 Wait, why? Isn’t that our goal? We will always need some remnant of a non green energy industries (oil for plastics, for example), but why is this an extreme position to push for entirely green energy? It’s a win win.
2614 2018-02-01 18:50:13 Trump is right. We need to bring back vocational schools. We need to put shop classes back in the high schools. Doesn’t mean you still can’t become a CEO. Means you can change your oil for $20 instead of $60.
2615 2018-02-01 18:49:53 Lucas Oil
2616 2018-02-01 18:49:53 Penny stocks to risky . Only takes a halt or massive news and u are screwed. But some gold oil weed stocks multiple dollars absolutely  sometimes but in general I don't short much at all .
2617 2018-02-01 18:49:46 Flamethrower v2 needs a 50,000v taser for the igniter. Adds redundant defense in case we run out of oil.
2618 2018-02-01 18:49:14 Cut into long shreds and saute in garlic oil and salt and pepper or cut into strips and use as you would pasta and mix with a nice ragu sauce :O)
2619 2018-02-01 18:49:04 Oil Ryc mix with garri
2620 2018-02-01 18:49:01 Rush just said we have hit record high oil production as a nation. Now is the perfect time to hammer out a high gas tax with a SUNSET provision and really build out infrastructure for the future!!!!!
2621 2018-02-01 18:48:59 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
2622 2018-02-01 18:48:53 "They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:" ~Matthew 25:3 #Bible
2623 2018-02-01 18:48:42 American geopolitical interests in the Middle East centre on a number of things with the most important being: oil, natural gas, pipeline routes, and the subjugating of all uncooperative governments.
2624 2018-02-01 18:48:23 most places say i can absolutely swap olive oil out for vegetable oil so im good its just man idk if i want my brownies tasting like evoo
that might make them milder tho idk
2625 2018-02-01 18:48:21 "But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps." ~Matthew 25:4 #Bible
2626 2018-02-01 18:48:15 Like not only are you butting into my convo with obvious advice I’ve already thought about and decided it wouldn’t work but then you start being passive aggressive and assuming shit. Stop worrying bout my plans and put some castor oil on your edges so they’ll grow back. Thanks.
2627 2018-02-01 18:48:15 Punjab has electricity factories using furnace oil; LNG; and coal, all imported. Looking at Sindh; Karachi; KPK; Northern Areas; FATA; and Baluchistan; when and where will they build their electricity factories and who will pay for their imported furnace oil; LNG; and coal?
2628 2018-02-01 18:48:14 MIX COCONUT OIL AND BAKING SODA TO A PASTE THAT SHIT WORKS SO WELL
2629 2018-02-01 18:48:14 So I replaced the coconut oil on my face with raw shea butter
2630 2018-02-01 18:47:30 This is getting tired especially with no real ‘hurtin’ plan to seriously step away from oil&gas.
Fence sitters on environmental devastation caused by carbon induced climate change will be reviled in the near & precarious future.
2631 2018-02-01 18:47:19 But we are ok importing full priced oil from the US.  What is wrong with the leadership in Canada?
2632 2018-02-01 18:47:12 Aramco is like a deepstate(?). When you're within Aramco camps it's like you're somewhere else. Aramco is more than an oil company.
2633 2018-02-01 18:46:58 Senator Lindsey Graham is another country oil, build WALL!
2634 2018-02-01 18:46:53 It is terrible for the animals and the environment. There was an article in veg news a few years ago about it. I gave up palm oil after reading it.
2635 2018-02-01 18:46:50 ok i   acquired brownie mix but we have no vegetable oil. ah.
2636 2018-02-01 18:46:48 bioré baking soda cleanser, ponds moisturiser, tea tree oil, dermal sheet masks sis!
2637 2018-02-01 18:46:45 I'm still enjoying all the chocolates & flowers from when we were greeted as liberators in Iraq! 
Did you know those oil revenues will pay for all of it...?
2638 2018-02-01 18:46:38 In the meantime Ottawa seems to be preparing to turn over all the keys to the offshore oil regulatory regime to the industry's sweat heart the CNLOPB so not really much faith in any of the players at the moment
2639 2018-02-01 18:46:27 Totally agree!  Shell Oil sent me to northern Michigan for 2 years...I quit and went to law school at University of Florida to thaw out!
2640 2018-02-01 18:46:10 Perhaps if you send them a 4' oil painting of yourself, produced at your expense, then they'll be obliged to?!
2641 2018-02-01 18:46:08 I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if you put coconut oil and cinnamon in your coffee it will taste like a muffin.
2642 2018-02-01 18:46:00 Loyal to the Oil, Hungry Man meals, that’s two episodes of mine for George right there.
2643 2018-02-01 18:45:58 @DavidCornDC MEDIA MUST CHASE LITTLE BALLS WHILE GOLAN HEIGHTS CONSPIRACY 4 TRILLIONS IN OIL MONEY GOES UNNOTICED....

2646 2018-02-01 18:45:23 So, I made turmeric-honey oil for Imbolc, put it in a shot of apple cider. It never occurred to me that I had just taken the oil off the stove.
I've killed everything by flash fire, I suppose.
2647 2018-02-01 18:45:18 I’m gunna oil up my babes like a fucking chip in a fryer r u mad
2648 2018-02-01 18:45:05 Good news for $CEI:  Oil jumped after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

2649 2018-02-01 18:45:01 Still waiting for your reply Keith stop burying your head in the sand - typical MEP you take the salary and do fuck all. At least a benefit of Brexit is we won't be lining the likes of your pockets any more. Viva UKOG and UK ONSHORE OIL AND GAS #ukog #brexit #MEP #OnTheDole
2650 2018-02-01 18:45:00 Excellent, oil will be around for a very longer time. 
2651 2018-02-01 18:44:55 Rosehip oil is everything I thought coconut oil was... and more. Wow
2652 2018-02-01 18:44:53 sorry to see Rogoff go..ADN is now fully a mouthpiece for the oil and gas industry in Alaska..and doing a much worse job of bringing rural and urban areas together in improved understanding of real issues and solutions to problems
2653 2018-02-01 18:44:42 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know

2656 2018-02-01 18:43:58 Breaking News Oil production has reached 10 million barrels a day we are exporting oil and natural gas a record numbers  news flash the ATLANTIC Bank is predicting a first quarter GDP of 5 to 5.5

2661 2018-02-01 18:43:42 does listening to stir fry by migos make you want to fill a pan with oil and cook your face in it?
2662 2018-02-01 18:43:25 Actually it was Besan's whole sale rate @Rs 600 for 10 kg.
He mixed it with Tata salts 17 Rs per kg and inferior quality Adani palm oil @30 rs / litre.
2663 2018-02-01 18:43:11 @DevinNunes Who da thunk it?  A dairy farmer traitor.  History will show that when you chose Trump, you were jumping into bed with a snake oil salesman.  Have you asked yourself why Trump never criticizes Russia for meddling in the US election?
2664 2018-02-01 18:43:04 Every time I watched a skin care routine video and they would talk about how it took them years to find the right products... I KNOW UNDERSTAND. I don't think I ever want to add an oil to my routine again, I definitely took my skin care for granted and well never again.
2665 2018-02-01 18:43:03 so we go out to get the Haverhill Echo...get to Histon roundabout...3 miles away...oil light. pull over. no oil...45 minutes later back home...say I can’t be assed but he’s determined...borrowing Mums tiny, shit courtesy car to drive out because hers is in the garage...

2667 2018-02-01 18:43:00 Nah im tryna go get an oil change at the express oil change spots not tryna amazon nun lmao
2668 2018-02-01 18:42:56 I was getting my oil changed and some old dude watching the local news on the TV told me he only likes to watch FOX News because "they have the hottest women on air"

2670 2018-02-01 18:42:26 Most Americans dont have $500 cash. You voted AGAINST any tax relief for them. In 8 yrs did Obama or dems ever propose permanent tax cuts?
2671 2018-02-01 18:42:17 Oil crossover?
2672 2018-02-01 18:42:13 Y’all should’ve been telling me to put coconut oil in my hair  the way it controls my frizz and makes my curls pop even more is amazing 
2673 2018-02-01 18:42:06 The most valuable resource globally is no longer oil, but 'DATA ECONOMY'. Data economy now controls the entire world!
2674 2018-02-01 18:41:59 Homegirl not getting an oil change she’s getting some other service , old folks don’t have no patience anymore .
2675 2018-02-01 18:41:55 My house is a little chilly actually. But the fact remains we always evolve. Yes all my stuff is made of oil I have vehicles. But eventually we have to look around see the inevitable future of what we are doing. I agree with you there is a lot of hypocrisy. My hardhat is also oil
2676 2018-02-01 18:41:43 Finally, don’t fear moisturizer and face oils; I use the Drunk Elephant Lala Retro and oil recently but you can also do health food store rosehip oil and Embryolisse.
2677 2018-02-01 18:41:42 Avi! I need more time  Which medium do you prefer for this one? 
May I could try out my oil paints I got for Christmas 
2678 2018-02-01 18:41:15 i don't tweet very often but i have an important message: if rosehip oil is not part of your daily skin care routine WHAT is u doin?
2679 2018-02-01 18:41:12 No it’s time for some nice hot green tea and your diffuser going with some great essential oil’s
2680 2018-02-01 18:40:49 Sooo I’m in this place waiting on my car to be finished from this oil change  & this lady keep burping with her mouth open IM PISSED 
2681 2018-02-01 18:40:48 Yeah I'm skeptical of the union's motivations too. Can't help but feel they're using oil and gas as a way to wedge the door back open on closures but don't doubt the feelings of many fishers being genuinely upset by perceived double standard
2682 2018-02-01 18:40:41 Hmm. I think Trump has no say at all over this stuff, tho he takes credit. Pruitt, Zinke, Heritage Fdn, oil lobby have had free hand. Won't even meet w/Dems or enviro lobby but strategize w/industry. What would bipartisan strategies that get stuff done look like?
2683 2018-02-01 18:40:40 Will he be visiting the Oil Sands too??
2684 2018-02-01 18:40:39 there's gotta be enough olive oil for the both of us

2700 2018-02-01 18:39:09 Oil will see transition. Smart heads see it as a nexus to the next energy source. There are doers and talkers. He’s a doer. I own an emissions biz that reduced tens of thousands of MT of GHG. I live net zero. In my way, I’m a doer. I get sick of talkers.
2701 2018-02-01 18:39:07 What kind of oil is it?
2702 2018-02-01 18:38:55 @yorkshirepost you ask, are protestors right to cause disruption at KM? Unfair question, why not ask same of Third energy and the police. I for one will embrace protestors when the oil/gas industry rolls into Nafferton whatever personal inconvenience I may experience.
2703 2018-02-01 18:38:34 @BlackburnTrentt bro I died with the oil on the stairs hahaha
2704 2018-02-01 18:38:32 Prolly a dumb question but the jiffy lube spots wouldnt carry the correct oil filter for my bmw would they???
2705 2018-02-01 18:38:30 @bigotires hour and a half for a conventional oil change? I’ll take my business elsewhere
2706 2018-02-01 18:38:15 The entire east coast will be a superfund site when oil and natural gas drilling is allowed. “Drill baby drill !” #sarcasm
2707 2018-02-01 18:38:14 May I apply sun oil and massage you Rita? Mmm 
2708 2018-02-01 18:38:03 They speculate high oil prices to cash in some investment made when cheap oil field sold during 20$
2709 2018-02-01 18:37:54 Overall Ottawa continues to demonstrate a willingness to grant offshore oil industry wide latitude on a variety of environmental regulatory issues, much politics at play
2710 2018-02-01 18:37:45 Road improvements imply following an oil based economy. Not the future. More appropriate to develop a circular economy which also involves alternative transport systems @hadleyac @vikki4mdnp @jasonmfalconer @BoroughofPoole
2711 2018-02-01 18:37:32 "immediately" and "as quickly as possible" are different things.

Also, the new stuff is cheaper (and continuing to get cheaper).  Who is trying to drive down the cost of coal, oil, gas ?
2712 2018-02-01 18:37:24 You’re clearly not a modern foodie hipster Mr D.  If I could charge £4.50 for some frozen fries, 10ps worth of Parmesan, and 7p of truffle oil...... I would.  As often as possible. Customers don’t need to understand GP and markups!

2715 2018-02-01 18:37:04 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them w oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven James 5:14-15

2732 2018-02-01 18:34:51 I eat steak fries because I'm lazy and it doesn't require a cutting board for me to prepare my sauce-justifying vehicles.

Just plain-Jane potatoes... no oil, salt, or seasoning. Into the air fryer they go, and out they come as edible sauce spoons so I don't feel like a fatty.
2733 2018-02-01 18:34:32 I just gave you two links one from Oil&Gas UK and one from Financial Times both starting to produce a barrel in North Sea is $12 and you are asking me quote”you can read I take it?”

2737 2018-02-01 18:34:07 I'm painfully slow when it comes to being informed about current politics compared to you & maybe my 15 min. of Google searching is inadequate to fill in this gap, but how did a Tylenol/peppermint oil joke jump the gap to commentary on mass incarceration and your white privilege?

2755 2018-02-01 18:32:22 So it was my 40th birthday, September 7th 2017, the day I was made redundant with a 6 month baby and a partner on maternity leave, well we have struggled through it and yesterday I was offered a job, 4 month contract to start but as long as the oil doesn't run out should go perm.

2760 2018-02-01 18:31:58 So we could get your oil changed, drop your car off for your inspection, get lunch, and then go to work? I’m in Greece tho today

2762 2018-02-01 18:31:49 Whatever chow they used without the oil. Supplementing with oil in context of that diet might lead to excess weight gain. Did the oil supplemented rats get obese? Is virgin olive oil protective in the context of obesity? Be nice to know if your doing the study.
2763 2018-02-01 18:31:48 I guess the hurdles @stephenharper faced via well-funded foreign anti-Canadian oil groups were real. @JustinTrudeau and @RachelNotley got some real world life lessons this week.

2778 2018-02-01 18:29:55 I suspect market players won't take all year to price this in.  Consensus is wrong,  as it is on the inputs to inflation (oil and wages to name 2) remaining benign.  All these $1000 bonuses yet everyone thinks "no wage inflation".
2779 2018-02-01 18:29:52 It seems most repliers know better than an environment/energy majored specialist.

2786 2018-02-01 18:29:09 I borrowed my parents' cars until I had my first, which was an 85 Ford Escort, gray with gray (grey?) interior. So ugly, so wrong. Burned out the engine the first year (who knew about oil?) and they rebuilt it b/c car was still under warranty

2791 2018-02-01 18:28:36 Even if it is the same, wouldn’t you rather pay about the same and know you get even more oil from here rather than from a country where slave labor is used? We should buy none from Saudi Arabia
2792 2018-02-01 18:28:30 The title of our report literally has "oil sands" in it.

2807 2018-02-01 18:26:37 My God...what is wrong with my country leaders...Is the financial obligation of building a refinery too burdensome that Nigeria can not build alone?What level of oil deposit has Niger to make it of huge interest for such partnership? Lion flocking with  sheep...
2808 2018-02-01 18:26:37 You refer to African countries as "shithole"  yet you guys are doing your best to destabilize countries in Africa with oil fields and minerals so you can keep developing...yet we here remain underdeveloped

2819 2018-02-01 18:24:35 Emissions would be marginally lower and consumers would be paying a lot more for gasoline. And we'd be buying more oil from foreign companies.
2820 2018-02-01 18:23:58 Who told u to look at other stuff anyways that means you weren’t 100 percent on my oil change and I need a discount

2835 2018-02-01 18:22:18 Ek aur Mr what-about!

Sir, why is it impossible for some to understand that many independent-minded people critiquing BJP criticised the Congress too earlier. If I speak of #Vyapam scam or oil/gas scams now, I also spoke against #CWG scam earlier.

Whataboutery is wasted on me!
2836 2018-02-01 18:22:16 Production hits highest level yet oil is 2.70/gallon still?
2837 2018-02-01 18:22:14 Tell me about it.

We settled on a VW TDI... Right before the scandal. ;-)

Before that:

81 Mercedes 300td (ran on fry oil)
79 volare (I loved that one)
84 olds 88 wagon (2 lanes wide)
2838 2018-02-01 18:22:06 Well that’s Leicester’s prerogative and if they lose out so be it. Don’t see why they should be pushed around by teams like Man City throwing their oil money around, or players like Mahrez. They should leave him to rot, training alone for the next 3-4 years.
2839 2018-02-01 18:21:52 Agree that impacts are impacts, whatever the regulatory framework is. But impacts on corals & sponges of fishing is more severe than of oil and gas... Touch the seabed and they are damaged. O&G activities (outside of spills risks) have smaller or more local impacts...
2840 2018-02-01 18:21:50 If we invest in renewable energies, it not only would ensure *complete* energy independence, but also create thousands of jobs, keep us at the forefront of technological innovation, and help to reverse climate change made far worse by reliance on oil.
2841 2018-02-01 18:21:48 How come the Gulf arab countries have masses of oil $$$ and are shitholes while places like Bhutan do not and are beautiful?
2842 2018-02-01 18:21:47 @OfficeOfRG Olive oil, Groundnut oil, orange and other fruit juice, vegetable juice aur pulses aur vegetable toh pahle se he mahengay hai agar har cheej mahengai kar dengay toh desh ke liye majboot health scheme toh launch karni he padegi.
2843 2018-02-01 18:21:39 Alaska has the same problem with gasoline. We have a pipeline bisecting the state and refineries along the route but gas costs far more here than the places our oil and gas gets shipped to! Does that make any sense???
2844 2018-02-01 18:21:35 only I would pop my trunk when the guy changing my oil says pop the hood 
2845 2018-02-01 18:21:11 Oil is there targate nothing more
2846 2018-02-01 18:21:11 got some oil paints.... stay tuned
2847 2018-02-01 18:21:10 Plus, Trump's trade policies caused the dollar to fall 11% since he took office which caused commodities to go up, OIL (for him & his buds), steel, wood etc. Low dollar makes imports expensive too. Bad for consumers/real economy. Temporary tax cut won't make a dent.
2848 2018-02-01 18:20:56 This is just more theater from alberta's  NDP. They hate the oil sands and everything to do with it. Watch the NDP's actions, not words.
2849 2018-02-01 18:20:46 I cant do protein more than once a month..i have really fine hair! I need to maybe do more hot oil treatments and lots of moisture  i need like supplements
2850 2018-02-01 18:20:42 They’ll attack morality from heated homes on an internet made of oil. They’ll often, hilariously, protest on a flotilla of kayaks made of oil. Hypocrisy is the lubricant of our modern society. Not oil.

2852 2018-02-01 18:20:34 Well ,international co operation ,that's what ,for all Oil trades dollar is the mediator ,so the dead currency is still breathing ,USD is completely credit based,they just printed it,wait for Petro crypto of Venezuela,USD will fall.
2853 2018-02-01 18:20:29 Gilles, at what efficiency is your oil burning engine operating? That has a significant impact on the energy extracted from ‘1 cubic mile of oil’ and means that your image is not comparing apples with apples. Too many assumptions, but looks pretty for the uninformed.
2854 2018-02-01 18:20:21 I get the Wild planet ones on Amazon. They are pack in olive oil
2855 2018-02-01 18:20:14 Right on peoples..lets lower our gas & oil prices 2 celebrate!
2856 2018-02-01 18:20:13 Salmon is good. I make it a lot now. I tend to steam it in foil with lemon and garlic and olive oil.
2857 2018-02-01 18:20:13 It's my pleasure.
2858 2018-02-01 18:20:06 I stopped asking for God’s opinion, I started asking for the next order. The oil flows when you are in order. God will tell you what to do when you delight in his ways. Be ready for the changes and see the problems as opportunities. My steps are ordered. I trusting God in me.
2859 2018-02-01 18:20:05 Donald Trump is planning on cutting 75% of Renewable Energy Funding, Trump is insane,he will let China and Asia take over one of the fastest growing Industries,Renewable Energy,not OIL,COAL,NUCLEAR or GAS,we need SOLAR and WIND and we need to be at the Forefront of it.
2860 2018-02-01 18:19:59 Same reason that oil producers all around the world ship crude oil to be used as feedstock at distant refineries. Dilbit is a competitor as a feedstock. US funded activists have convinced everyone that dilbit remain in the ground. And the US benefits by buying it cheap from us.

2864 2018-02-01 18:19:32 I would do the deep conditioning ones, like olive oil, but it always made my hair feel shittier i felt. i'm gonna look up steaming
2865 2018-02-01 18:19:27 Try to look in from outside our imperial, jingoist up-bringing. In what world does a free thinking educated population vote for and re-elect a government who murder foreigners in the name of oil and greed? It's a two party system, where the other party also support foreign murder

2878 2018-02-01 18:18:03 The government/DFO needs to get past fisheries vs oil & gas, and focus on impacts regardless of their origins if habitat conservation and species protection are to be successful
2879 2018-02-01 18:17:59 This is great Sarah. So all the mega rich oil people get richer with tax cuts and raise the gas prices. America, where the rich keep getting richer and the poor pay for it!

2919 2018-02-01 18:15:09 Now people live indoors, aircon etc. Before oil, people worked outdoors, you had to cover up, that is why ME men were not sensitised to it.

2988 2018-02-01 18:08:17 Yeah! No. Trump has too many oil buddies to pay back. Years ago the US turned it’s back on renewables for oil. Result? Germany built on our wind tech. China built on our solar tech. Trump isn’t dumb. He knows what’s right but he owes a lot  to some wealthy people.
2989 2018-02-01 18:07:58 SAME! Almond oil is okay for mine too but das it!

President refuses to implement government ordered sanctions. First shipment of Russian oil to ever reach Americas shores arrives. Priceless.

2995 2018-02-01 18:07:23 The resource is owned by Alberta.  Production licenses are approved by Alberta. The oil companies pay a royalty on production. The activity in support of the O&G industry is critical to Alberta. All of Canada does and has benefited.

Alberta needs to tell BC to stop this anti - oil crap or Alberta will shut off all oil going into BC from Alberta which is most of not all of it. THAT would bring BC to its senses!!

3060 2018-02-01 18:00:21 One provision in the GOP tax bill mandates that the federal government hold lease sales in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). This would open the area up to oil drilling and other energy development, lifting a 40-year-ban
3061 2018-02-01 18:00:18 Duke: And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. We copy that here. Over.

3067 2018-02-01 17:59:22 it's all business for them. What makes them money. Oil has it's positive & negative like all sources of energy. Does pollute especially, when not handled properly.

3123 2018-02-01 17:53:48 well there is basically a world war going on in the middle east since trump took over and gas has risen what 20 cents? maybe this hyper production has something to do with it. (what the fuck will happen to texas when oil is worthless)
3124 2018-02-01 17:53:39 So heaven? RT @theAfroLegalise Ordered Nigerian food for this meeting And the whole room smells like palm oil and cray fish 
3125 2018-02-01 17:53:19 Cortisone 10 (the intensive healing kind) and a good oatmeal bath with a lil coconut oil in it. You can find the oatmeal bath packets thru Aveeno! This routine helps me so much when I get hives.

3128 2018-02-01 17:53:03 There are so many reasons to dislike Donald Trump, but the biggest reason of all has to be the way once decent people have sold their souls for his snake oil.
3129 2018-02-01 17:52:59 Perhaps trump is deregulating renewables. Increasing oil prices promote the growth in renewables. More jobs will be available. How does this act by trump support your statement?
3130 2018-02-01 17:52:54 Coconut oil is the best thing ever
3131 2018-02-01 17:52:43 I have a quick question. I take krill oil, a multivitamin, a D3 supplement, and a probiotic everyday. Should I take these all at one time, or should I take them separately?
3132 2018-02-01 17:52:31 coconut oil coffee tastes just like love feels 
3133 2018-02-01 17:52:26 Close encounter with an MLM oil peddler via /r/antiMLM

This is my first Reddit post, as I have always been the quintessential internet lurker. However, after what happened last night, I feel the need to duck out of the shadows, as this encounter was just too weird and outra…
3134 2018-02-01 17:52:13 while not good for use "every day" there are a lot of people who react very well to coconut oil (yeah, not everyone) i get outbreaks form most commercial face creams, but not  SheaMoisture heavy hand cream, or coconut oil
3135 2018-02-01 17:52:09 Even has a look out patio on the wall lol, The vats of burning oil must be behind the wall now.
3136 2018-02-01 17:52:07 I can only speak from my own experience, but when I started having both eyesight and memory problems, I started taking quality Omega fish oil caps & it helped radically. Whenever I stop taking them, my eyesight in particular degrades within a week. #justsayin
3137 2018-02-01 17:52:05 Black Jamaican castor oil is truly a gift from God 
3138 2018-02-01 17:52:00 And how much oil and gas did you use to get there? How much will you use to get back?
3139 2018-02-01 17:51:58 Is this oil and acrylic on panel? Love the play of texture and deep hues
3140 2018-02-01 17:51:33 @realDonaldTrump U R wrong on Venezuela because America gave sanctuary to the vicious corrupt dictators Carmona & Perez that murdered thousands of Venezuela poor people so they can steal oil & land. These vicious dictators sit in US mansions plotting to rob Venezuela again.

3142 2018-02-01 17:50:55 Oil and powder cant stop us !!!!
3143 2018-02-01 17:50:48 Not true. Not true. Trump has you convinced of the propaganda madness Putin taught him. Trump is an evil con man. I would never believe anything that snake oil salesman says.

3157 2018-02-01 17:49:23 Why do your cars require a quart of synthetic oil every tank of gas? Think I'll #BuyAmerican, @MINI @MINIUSA.
3158 2018-02-01 17:49:15 FYI, washing your face too much will cause excess oil secretion. If you have oily or acne prone skin, use gel moisturizer so your face won't overproduce oil. Wash your face twice a day, and use the moisturizer after, and it should clear up soon. Also exfoliate twice a week :)
3159 2018-02-01 17:49:14 Ordered Nigerian food for this meeting And the whole room smells like palm oil and cray fish 
3160 2018-02-01 17:49:12 ALL indications point to oil entering a DEMAND super-cycle.   SUPPLY is the the trillion $ question.  Will OPEC+ remain in prod control, with an eye to price over prod?  Will US prod overwhelm demand, sparking another prod war? IF supply plays along with demand - BOOM! #oott #WTI

3165 2018-02-01 17:48:43 Make America White Again

Make America Dependent on Oil Again

Neither of the above will happen but that's what they want.  Anyway, we just have to vote them all out in November.
3166 2018-02-01 17:48:42 What's an oil wash and how do I do it? If you don't mind me asking
3167 2018-02-01 17:48:37 Just for clarification, is that .. like ... Oil ?
3168 2018-02-01 17:48:27 i feel like (hope?) there will be a crash in oil production simply because no one needs it in about 10 years.
3169 2018-02-01 17:48:14 Water is the new oil
3170 2018-02-01 17:48:14 Mine works fine in the winter. Once you get that summer weight oil out of it
3171 2018-02-01 17:48:11 How is that possible? Lower USD = increased purchasing power for emerging mkts AND Europe/Japan. Oil getting too high would be main risk - don't think we're there yet.
3172 2018-02-01 17:48:09 I just chewed a fish oil pill.....fish juice squirted all in my mouth ...
3173 2018-02-01 17:48:08 Wow  it's gone already I've used palm oil 
3174 2018-02-01 17:47:40 There comes a point surely when you remember your upbringing, schooling and religion and realise that to keep telling lies like this makes them all irrelevant. You’ve become a cheap snake oil peddler.
3175 2018-02-01 17:47:21 It’s $85 for an oil change bro wtf
3176 2018-02-01 17:47:21 I loved Oil
3177 2018-02-01 17:47:05 About a year ago R Maddow reported about huge oil field somewhere under Artic Ocean, over a trillion worth she said (?). Nunes gone crazy, head of CIA Pompeo let in top Russia spies in WH yesterday. Could they all be getting huge payoffs? $500 million or more.
3178 2018-02-01 17:46:53 I'm a moody person because I don't oil people...
3179 2018-02-01 17:46:49 Yeah I showed up to basic training excited to fight Nazis & the US military was all like “no, we only murder brown people for oil now.” I said I wasn’t racist. “Well we also have really lax rules against rape.” I said I wasn’t a Republican and so we parted ways.
3180 2018-02-01 17:46:45 As bad as petunia oil
3181 2018-02-01 17:46:30 
Higher concentration in window sills. Entry barrier.

Aloe+Coconut oil+Citronella+ Mint as lotion/gel is easy too, if mosquitoes still hide around.
3182 2018-02-01 17:46:23 oil can
3183 2018-02-01 17:46:17 Citing an advocacy group for the position you support isn't exactly playing fair. Tobacco companies don't think smoking will kill you and oil companies find oil to be good for seabirds. Look at Standford's CREDO for non-partisan scholarship.
3184 2018-02-01 17:46:16 Cannabis was taxed out of use then made illegal as public support waned all so that DuPont would have less competition for the their oil, plastics and paper patents. Any constitutional conservative that's against it doesn't know what the term constitutional conservative means.
3185 2018-02-01 17:46:10 Update: Used beard oil all 31 days on January and still no progress. Hopefully February will be better 
3186 2018-02-01 17:46:08 #NationalTexasDay 

On this day we thank God for Whataburger, a West Texas sunset, the oil fields, Shiner beer, the river, rodeos, the Alamo, red dirt country music and so much more that you can’t put in 280 characters
3187 2018-02-01 17:46:02 Coconut oil in my coffee has literally been a game changer. I feel great. 10/10 would recommend 
3188 2018-02-01 17:46:01 Possibly they bet on 80 dollars and if the oil cannot reach 80 dollars, their bets will fail so their loss soar. Typical goldman failure as used to be in Venezuelan junk bonds investment.
3189 2018-02-01 17:45:48 Oh I think my aggressive persona #on_here overstates my passion. I'm actually sad so many sold their cars on snake oil. I have no real skin in the game, at least not enough to hate it.
3190 2018-02-01 17:45:41 옷도 둘다 흑막같이 입어가지고ㅋㅋ
3191 2018-02-01 17:45:31 devil's advocate: get that oil out now before no one has any use for it.
3192 2018-02-01 17:45:16 Garima mon evening sayaraksha light diya with til oil. And pray to sharada ambal. She is vakdevi and shiv will protect him. Everything wikl fall into place
3193 2018-02-01 17:45:13 He is in deep with the coal and oil industries. this isn't about what's best for the country.  this is about what's best for trump.
3194 2018-02-01 17:45:07 *looks over at oil diffuser* I never liked it anyway.
3195 2018-02-01 17:45:06 Nothing to sacrifice madam. 
Wait and watch the role of GST. 
Oil and Real state is coming under GST and the rate of GST will go down and in the end of 2019 the average tax of goods will be 5-10% only

3197 2018-02-01 17:44:54 Anything is better than perpetuating global subjugation and blood for oil and resources.
3198 2018-02-01 17:44:53 So right.  After the oil spill a lot of workers didn't have jobs/money and that actually affected a lot of strip clubs (not a shock).  It's not just one person/one industry.  That's not how things work.  Plus, they are some of the few who actually use cash!
3199 2018-02-01 17:44:47 If ur looking to save money make a coconut oil beard balm and add your own incense to it. Or u can be a sheep and buy it for 3x the price hahah
3200 2018-02-01 17:44:44 Drink water. Lather yourself in coconut oil. Get your nails done. Read books. Start a business. Mind your own
3201 2018-02-01 17:44:39 I've been paying close attention to these posts; we have an oil diffuser and have looked into what oils will be safe for our kitties when we move somewhere they can live with us. No sick kitties in my household!
3202 2018-02-01 17:44:33 I love making pasta with Bertolli oil. I put capsicum, olives, onion, corns, salt, origami. After boiling pasta put all this on low flame and it is ready to eat.

3212 2018-02-01 17:43:41 Based on inflation, why is it that gasoline prices are still at the level that emulates gas prices during the height of the OPEC oil embargo of the 1970s if we are producing so much today that we can now export it?

3226 2018-02-01 17:42:53 Sitting back watching commodities looking for entry in Metals and Oil, ill be waiting for a decisive move. Too much chop.

I do think oil makes new highs, and I don't see gold below $1300 again, but those are guesses and I've decided not to input trades based on my wild hunches.
3227 2018-02-01 17:42:46 Don't be too worried about budget

3229 2018-02-01 17:42:32 Because we are going to be driving electric cars and alternative fuel. The grand Cheeto thinks that they should run on coal. You can take all that coal and oil and use it to give to your base when they get screwed over this

3233 2018-02-01 17:42:05 Fracking is the single biggest reason that a billionty MW of coal has/will retire. Obama's decision to let fracking be didn't hurt.  Producers discovered they can also frack for oil. Not ideal, but I'll trade a few million bbl oil for a few million tons of coal

3244 2018-02-01 17:40:36 Might sound weird but because of the light in the oil one it feels more fantastical to me while the darker tone overall in the gouache one gives it a more realistic natural feel. I quite enjoy both though ^_^

3264 2018-02-01 17:39:28 No. How is this remotely related to oil production. Why are we doing this.

3266 2018-02-01 17:39:16 I can't understand why @realDonaldTrump is so pro coal when we have renewable sources of energy like Whale Oil. #BeautifulWhaling
3267 2018-02-01 17:39:13 there's setting coming

about what it could be or how I could act when it gets here
but this time,
 right now,
I'd rather not know
and instead
find out when it gets here

when we meet
3268 2018-02-01 17:39:08 No prob...while you're there, stop in to @OlivetheSenses - our favs are 'Traditional Balsamic' and 'Toasted Sesame'. We only buy oil and vinegar from here now. The quality is crazy ridiculous!

3270 2018-02-01 17:38:33 use tea tree oil
3271 2018-02-01 17:38:32 Uhhh... Very important not to conflate oil production with net carbon production. Low natural gas prices coupled with Obama's Clean Power Plan meant new coal plants stopped being economical in the last 10 years. Natural gas produces less CO2/MWh than coal. Good for climate.

3277 2018-02-01 17:37:16 Hahahaha! Coal industry. If we stop working on renewable energy tech and rely more on fossil fuels, is there a particular nation, say, Russia that stands to benefit from rising oil prices?

3285 2018-02-01 17:36:33 Do you realize that the world’s natural gas and crude oil will completely depleted within 50 years and coal in 200? We need to start working on renewable energy sources NOW before we have an energy crisis later and we have a president who is shutting down programs that we need
3286 2018-02-01 17:36:23 This pipeline will never be built I can guarantee it. Been waiting a decade and they haven’t started yet, sell to US there good guys and deserve our discounted oil I guess

Also, since we abandoned vocational education, we have a skilled worked shortage in oil, manufacturing, and contracting/infrastructure. We are short abt. 10M

3397 2018-02-01 17:24:10 Mate. Always get asked about what products I use to moisturise/detangle/ define curls and I’m just like...oil? 
At the same time I’ve purchased products (mainly for image) that have had varying positive effects on my hair but I would never deem them as mandatory

I can legally use CBD oil and MJ in GA due to epilepsy (I haven’t chosen to do so yet), and Sessions wants to kill it for the children who benefit tremendously. Can he please be removed?

3400 2018-02-01 17:23:27 Annapolis Grad, Georgetown Masters, NYU MBA & a doctorate, oil industry consultant and investment banker, Carter Page would seem to be one of the most falsely vilified people on earth. No surprise #Russia would be a client. The business of #Russia is oil.

3402 2018-02-01 17:23:11 Oil industry would oppose, so I doubt it.
3403 2018-02-01 17:23:07 maybe an oil based cleanser would be a good shout to look at? I've seen people rave about how their really kind to skin and they're super good at removing makeup as well, if I didn't have a problem with spots atm i'd try some out

3427 2018-02-01 17:19:57 So why is it that we (US) subsidize the Oil and Coal industries with billions each year and complain about Wind and Solar subsidies? Can’t we just let them stand or fall based on the market?

3445 2018-02-01 17:17:31 Arabs turning to each other, eating their flesh, unstopable, indeed a punishment from God. They lost direction fighting over boundaries created by Europeans. One people, one religion, one region, blessed with oil but cursed by Allah.

3469 2018-02-01 17:14:56 What are medals for? Running away to play war games in oil countries while our people are under attack by fascists? Or being too cowardly to stand up and say “Enough!”?
3470 2018-02-01 17:14:51 AND lots of especially damaging urban drilling (in LA and elsewhere) with demonstrated debilitating health & safety effects on hundreds of thousands. Under guise of energy independence, oil producers fighting vs. improved health/safety regs & for increased neighborhood drilling.
3471 2018-02-01 17:14:50 My family's background is in oil and gas, the disregard for safety or accountability in drilling and extraction has me very worried about the prospects of leaving these materials and facilities in private hands. A state-owned approach would make me more comfortable with Nuclear.
3472 2018-02-01 17:14:43 Schumer should have joined other Democrats in calling for the removal of Pelosi. These snake oil peddlers are the reason why the Dems are where they are today. They are doing Absolutely Nothing but Whining.  Clean house and start over is the best solution.

3474 2018-02-01 17:14:33 In one of ur interview 2day u talked abt oil price. I quote wt u told."The amnt collected is very essential to build infra. Rational citizens shud understand tht although d prices are troublesome, the taxes are to build roads that vehicle owners use too"
3475 2018-02-01 17:14:23 Okay gotcha. I struggle with that 5 o clock shadow around my jaw/mouth too lol. Definitely look into chemical exfoliations (AHAs/BHAs) and I started oil cleansing last week so doesn’t hurt to look into that too
3476 2018-02-01 17:14:11 People forget why the US & UK put their weight behind fossil fuels & controlling the oil market; they’re indispensable to the war industry that the US dominates #LaNeta
3477 2018-02-01 17:13:56 Good on you Mr. Prime Minister, we all need that pipeline.
NOW, how about getting the ENERGY EAST line built so we can tell the Middle East to keep their dirty oil at home we'll use our own thanks.
3478 2018-02-01 17:13:38 I was on a price so did one coat over the OA, covered ok-ish but I dont like -ish Rentals id use oil as it lasts for the Landlords. Good topic this. Lee Would it peel with two coats?

3484 2018-02-01 17:12:53 Why, because they did not want to sell for 50m. Why did Rich clubs think they can just buy whoever they want whenever they want for the price they want. Man city has plenty of oil money to afford such luxuries as a mid tables best player.

Telomere length irrelevant if mice don't live longer. BUT raises interesting question? Could oils be factor in human lean NAFLD?

3490 2018-02-01 17:11:44 I'd hope so. The nuance and language of the article states Denton would "buy" solar/wind contracts that would total 100% of Denton's energy needs. 
It doesn't say what, if any, effect on fracking would be. We still need to elect Reps who will push back against oil&gas and...(1/2)
3491 2018-02-01 17:11:42 Begs the question,Devin Nunes,what's in YOUR wallet? Rubles? Or an IOU for Russian oil $$? Or do they have kompromat on you since you were part of transition,you and PENCE?
3492 2018-02-01 17:11:37 @jasonnash Wyatt could make something that helps the environment. Maybe like a complex water filter, or a machine that takes oil out of water (oil spills)
3493 2018-02-01 17:11:37 Do we need any more proof that Trump and Tillerson are dealing with Russia? Think money, oil, and Alaska. The fact that it was disclosed by Russian authorities is evidence that Moscow wants to boast that sanctioned officials can travel into the United States. #ThursdayThoughts
3494 2018-02-01 17:11:36 I've noticed diesel prices in my area proportionately are higher than historic prices. 
 the new Supply is a lighter, sweeter so more gasoline is recovered in refining and less by-products like diesel as a result.
Also, a few refiners are down, they were optimized for heavier oil
3495 2018-02-01 17:11:36 Dear PM reduce the tax rates for medium class, bring more jobs for the youth and bring oil(petrol/diesel) and oil products within GST if you want to win in 2019.

3498 2018-02-01 17:11:25 Rises in Oil and Gasoline prices at the pump are related to a bunch of issues. While US Shale continues to ramp up, it is still trying to catch up with demand from Trump Commerce because of Obama’s actions re Keystone XL & Dakota Access, which delayed those projects.

3518 2018-02-01 17:09:30 But the R base drives the narrative on immigration. I get the impression that the narrative on AGW is driven by big business (oil $) and the base just plays along for the liberal tears. Which is why I think they'll eventually lose interest on that issue sooner.
3519 2018-02-01 17:09:27 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
3520 2018-02-01 17:09:25 To me Energy East makes sense. Eastern Canada buys imported oil from the likes of Venezuela and Saudi. Alberta crude is sold to US at a discount while refined products are purchased from US by eastern Canada at a premium

3526 2018-02-01 17:08:34 #MyFirstVehicleWas a 1989 @mitsucars Mitsubishi Cordia L . It was awesome and had a sun roof. Those were the days!!! I had it one day until I forgot you had to put oil in it. Silly me. The four kids from amp and myself had to walk a mile to camp. #funtimes
3527 2018-02-01 17:08:30 After I got in the biz decades ago, my father-in-law used to call to ask me for 5qt's so he could change the oil in his car.
3528 2018-02-01 17:08:26 Coconut oil as lub>>>
3529 2018-02-01 17:08:11 Now your pushing fossil free
So you even know how many products are made from crude oil.  Let's just pick one
Plastic. Plastic is in every part or your life.  Your talking about 
Laying off 50 percent of the work force.  Look around you
Plastic in everything
3530 2018-02-01 17:08:08 I do wonder if perhaps the cold weather isn’t helping with the products? I was previously using Neutorgenia oil free moisturiser and that is great, only about £4/£5 too. Think I’ll go back to that and wait for the warmer weather before writing off Glossier completely.
3531 2018-02-01 17:08:07 Mine gets super unruley, too (even as a white guy). I use a beard oil and, on days when it’s especially stubborn, a beard balm. I’ve also invested in a good stiff brush to beat it into submission.
3532 2018-02-01 17:07:35 Dial miracle oil hand soap smells faintly like old church lady and I lowkey like it
3533 2018-02-01 17:07:33 ยังคิดถึงได้ไหม..
3534 2018-02-01 17:07:29 With pre-season nets starting shortly, now might be a good time to dust the bat off and give it a lick of linseed oil. Alternatively, if you're a bowler then you can always invest some time polishing your balls 
3535 2018-02-01 17:07:26 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
3536 2018-02-01 17:07:23 The crass political manuvering by BCNDP on Kinder Morgan pipeline is an opportunity. Alberta gets ripped off on the electricity we buy from them. Time to fast track technology to convert old oil wells to electricity. Green clean & distributed power #abenergy #ableg
3537 2018-02-01 17:07:10 Make no mistake, #oil 1hr chart shows all momentum indicators now exhausted hirer, flatten out all morning, reversal pending after last hour candle touches 20MA and pops higher one last time. 1 day candles also signal reversal. Keep #WATCH , confirm lower under 20ma, then $DWT

Jet Oil 
3540 2018-02-01 17:06:47 THC is the best cannabinoid for treating these conditions so I would assume it would be in there. If not then this bill is pointless anyways. You can buy CBD oil already.
3541 2018-02-01 17:06:42 Why is Putin bragging about oil deliveries to America which in essence bypasses Russian sanctions? Why is the Russian MOD threatening US 6th fleet with a Russian fighter response? Why is Russian media bragging about Mnuchin swapping the real sanctions report for a Forbes list?

3546 2018-02-01 17:06:17 It can be found in homeopathic pharmacies right next to the famed “oil of smoke”.  More importantly I need to find out where I can buy a science hoe. I need something new for my garden tools.
3547 2018-02-01 17:06:15 The whole concept of the carbon tax is to reduce oil consumption, very ineffective tax for reducing carbon but very effective in raising money for the gov coffers.
3548 2018-02-01 17:06:06 Qualcuno usa il tea tree oil?
3549 2018-02-01 17:06:02 Find a oil replacement, fool!! Then NOBODY will need anything... from them! Why do you allow hundreds of thousands of ALIENS in to USA, Bc they have qualified legally! Any illegal anywhere in the “ GLOBE” is usually deported if not imprisoned b 4 deported
3550 2018-02-01 17:06:02 1/ I trade E&P's, not crude.  But crude is the sole basis of E&P revenues.  That makes knowing the crude market my #1 priority.  I do not promote my book.  To each their own.  BUT, i feel compelled to highlight a potential opp.  SOME Canadian E&P's are light/med oil prod's

3556 2018-02-01 17:05:36 I use the same stuff as Immy, and also Charity Pot and celestial from Lush. Vitamin E facial oil when life gets desperate. This cold little island is making my tan less golden and more tarnished and why do bad things happen to good people whyyyyyy
3557 2018-02-01 17:05:35 My brother carried all the beards for two. Stingy mofo. I’m here buying beard oil about . Happy birthday sha.
3558 2018-02-01 17:05:32 Best way to get you to sleep! I use lavender oil 
3559 2018-02-01 17:05:31 Nak beli mascara lah nt gaji pastu cleansing oil dah habis. Scrub dah beli awal awal, sbb asyik out of stock je kan
3560 2018-02-01 17:05:30 I heard it also helps to put baby oil on damp skin after you shower/bathe to keep the moisture in so the skin doesn't dry out and break.
3561 2018-02-01 17:05:22 That sad sad moment when you love Nutella but realize one of its main ingredients is palm oil
3562 2018-02-01 17:05:21 Add in 5-6 drops of jojoba oil and use 2 full pumps of moisturizer. Also, the first 2-3 weeks are the "dry time" and there's often not much you can do about it. This dryness subsides once your skin becomes accustomed to benzoyl peroxide.
3563 2018-02-01 17:05:17 I just put peppermint essential oil on my temples cause it's supposed to *relax* but it ran into my eyes and now I am very *not relaxed*
3564 2018-02-01 17:05:16 I have super dry skin so I switched to oil cleansers, but washing at night seems to work better 4 me too !
3565 2018-02-01 17:05:06 Cocoa butter, shea butter, macadamia oil, argan oil, African black soap... probably found where the black and brown people shop. Aren’t there “ethnic” markets or ethnic body care” section in the pharmacy or supermarkets? Or does it not work that way in Denmark?
3566 2018-02-01 17:05:02 My favourite is the Jo Malone London Red Roses Bath Oil. Would be a glorious addition to my bathroom shelf and the scent is a bouquet of loveliness x

3587 2018-02-01 17:03:18 Thanks for your assistance earlier. Appreciated the multi agency response to identify the source. Our STW teams found it to be an oil spill.
3588 2018-02-01 17:03:16 @jjhorgan Seems you may get your wish of a carbon free BC sooner than you think. Saskatchewan is likely to side with Alberta in boycotting your products and may stop sending you oil as wlee.

3590 2018-02-01 17:03:07 Can't see this working. Hardly going to walk in to a petrol station and ask them to wheel that thing out. It will make EVs look stupid and more hassle than refuelling. Which of course is far from reality but what do you expect from an oil company?

3597 2018-02-01 17:02:31 One reason is that Tillertson as head of Exxon was negotiating an oil deal worth billions. He has received Russia's highest medals by Putin and so is a friend of Putin. He is the reason the top Russian spy and FSB (f/k/a) the KGB were in the country last week speaking with Pompeo

3649 2018-02-01 16:57:23 Also, palm oil producers for biodiesel have invested in GHG avoidance measures to achieve the thresholds set by the EU. Those requirements are not necessary fulfilled for palm oil which is used in the areas of food, feed, chemicals.

3658 2018-02-01 16:56:26 ISCC does not support the vote of the EU parlament for banning palm oil for energy applications. This is a wrong signal for the markets. Palm oil being used for the EU-bioenergy market is 100% certified and deforestation-free.

3677 2018-02-01 16:53:49 Yeah, dumb article. The Chinese have done very well because of policies begun under GHWB to dismantle much of our manufacturing and engage in never-ending Middle East wars. They get Iraq’s oil, they get Afghanistan’s minerals. Our troops don’t need to be their security forces.
3678 2018-02-01 16:53:34 Hi have you tried vbites bacon apparently they are really good especially if you add some oil to the pan so they don't taste dry. Not as easy to find compared to Quorn products but I know Morrison's sell them.

3802 2018-02-01 16:37:27 You’re dumb. For a polluted country with no oil reserves like India, petrol should be highly taxed. The taxes should be used to create public infrastructure like Metro and High Speed Train, that can benefit the country in long term. This is what modi did. #BudgetWithNDTV

3846 2018-02-01 16:31:50 Oddly enough, Albertans like those things as well and they buy them with wages earned from extracting and selling crude oil. So, lovely that you think only of yourself and nothing of your neighbours. How Canadian of you.

3865 2018-02-01 16:29:37 Where i get a oil Change for the low?
3866 2018-02-01 16:29:06 Will truly be amazing if: (1) trend continues for years until combination of shale production slowing and lack of long-term projects means oil prices spike; and (2) EV production ($35k cars) and infrastructure (charging stations) are in place to capitalize and grow exponentially!
3867 2018-02-01 16:29:04 Thanking god for looking out for my car until I got an oil change 5 min ago. This guy goes "you only had 1% of oil left in your car. Foolin"
3868 2018-02-01 16:28:59 So the White House is cutting research into renewable energy? Why? Because of all the jobs it created? It lowered oil costs?

3875 2018-02-01 16:27:49 That's so odd they did that to you. I liked Yasmin and I was on it for 3 years but I've had the implanon for a year now so I don't take the pill anymore. Epiduo prescription cream and gentle, oil and alcohol free cleansers, toners and moisturisers will be your best friend.
3876 2018-02-01 16:27:43 Coco gets real fussy about me putting omega 3 oils in her food, but her skin has been so dry and itchy and massaging baby oil on her is only a temporary fix. Idk what else to do. Oatmeal baths? Other oils for her food? 
3877 2018-02-01 16:27:39 The key thing is technological change. There were many who said that US oil production would never again reach 1970s levels, but they assumed technology wouldn't advance. It did, and here we are. "Peak oil" will come from demand reductions, not supply constraints.
3878 2018-02-01 16:27:38 Oil changes should be $20! Not $60+
3879 2018-02-01 16:27:36 Would be instructive to know who's getting away with the oil revenue, and who in Lybia is facilitating. I'm sure some in U.S. State Dept know.

3889 2018-02-01 16:26:15 I see +62 (~62.75) as a bottom.  Current underlying oil market (real mkt, not spec mkt) conditions are facing much higher risk to supply shortage, than demand shortage.  As such, I view 70 as the more likely target than 62, at this point.  Ceteris paribus, of course.

3932 2018-02-01 16:22:00 He is not giving land over for Big Oil the land belongs to the American people and there are rules in the Constitution about the land and exactly what they can do with it you can't just take land and just take it for no reason!
3933 2018-02-01 16:21:59 This nigga blew all his money on balenciagas and now he only got plain bread and oil to eat at home... Tragic
3934 2018-02-01 16:21:52 I saw that. It's delicious. There will always be snake oil.
3935 2018-02-01 16:21:52 Odds are oil's prominence will return as more credible climate change models are showing that since 2007 Earth has transitioned into global cooling, forecasting another mini-ice-age.  Prevailing policies are going to leave us shivering in the dark.
3936 2018-02-01 16:21:41 This certainly turned the "peak oil" paradigm on its head in an unexpected way. I think climate-change scenarios haven't yet fully grappled with the implications, both + and - (less coal, more gas, etc.)
3937 2018-02-01 16:21:33 Oil is dying in the US.  Export that crap anywhere else.  It's time for cleaner options and banning plastics made with petroleum.
3938 2018-02-01 16:21:31 What I smell like after a shower: a confusing mixture of tea tree oil, lavender oil, rose water, peaches, pomegranates & a hint of vanilla 

Then it all fucking fades away by next morning

3948 2018-02-01 16:20:54 Jeez, why does oregano oil taste so bad! I hope this crap works.
3949 2018-02-01 16:20:53 We all admire you Rachell, but you should rethink your stand on KMorgan. Why not refine that dreadful oil in Canada? Why send it to spoil our waters? Burrard I. is the only water close by that I can paddle in. There will be a spill. @rachelnotley @johnhorgan

3952 2018-02-01 16:20:19 yes it is cos in UK scots have NO democracy and lose 92% of our resource wealth(oil and gas) to prop up WM who cant admit that scots subsidise England,so media has told English that scots are subsidised,In EU scots have a voic,a vote,and a veto,so EU is better prospect
3953 2018-02-01 16:20:15 #oil is signaling lower this moment. #WATCH $DWT ???
#natgas continues moment lower. #WATCH $DGAZ ???
3954 2018-02-01 16:19:49 True. It's not Benghazi or Vince Foster craziness, it's Honduras coup, Iraq / Libya, Haitian aid, Monsanto, WalMart plantation economy that works for Wall Street over Main Street, advocating fracking, Big Oil, etc.

She may be a good person. Her policies aren't.
3955 2018-02-01 16:19:38 Pake mawar+olive oil kalo ga olive oil+gula, discrub gitu
3956 2018-02-01 16:19:31 Yup, and not just that, medicine, food additives, mechanical lubricants, electronic components, everything contains oil derivatives.
3957 2018-02-01 16:19:24 coconut oil (hot n melted) hand soap (antibacterial if poss) n washing up liquid dip beauty blender in it massage it then rinse with hot water works a treat !!!!!
3958 2018-02-01 16:19:16 SEMC: prices of basic food items in 2017 were on average 25%, 50% and 72% higher than in 2016, 2015 & pre-war prices. The increas in the prices of flour, sugar, rice, milk and cooking oil was due to the fall of the Yemeni rial, rising fuel prices and other war-related factors.

3967 2018-02-01 16:18:06 The fed worries about inflation but inflation is scared to death of the Fed. Since the Arab Oil Embargo and the Volcker era, the fed raised rates in anticipation of runaway inflation and finally had to rejigger  inflation. Here again, we bullchit the inflation game.

3973 2018-02-01 16:17:14 @BundleOohJoy I really think rosehip seed oil and vitamin e oil do the same thing. lol. I don't see much difference in my skin from using the rose oil the past couple weeks.
3974 2018-02-01 16:17:08 Sir can someone throw light on the oil import bill in 2013-14 and now. What were the savings from 2014 due to reduction in oil import bill.
3975 2018-02-01 16:16:42 Oil provides many different benefits: Fish oil for joints, Argan oil for hair, and Bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3976 2018-02-01 16:16:34 Haven’t had my Trader Joe’s tea tree oil face wash in a month... finally washed my face with it last night, woke up with brand new skin this morning 
3977 2018-02-01 16:16:31 You wanted someone who wasn't a professional career politician… I get that. Replacing a politician with a bombastic snake oil salesman is not the answer though.
3978 2018-02-01 16:16:29 “U.S. oil production surpassed 10M barrels/day in Nov for first time in nearly 50 yrs, a milestone that underscores the growing dominance of the U.S. oil industry... the U.S. is on pace to pull ahead of Saudi Arabia” 

Meanwhile - Justin has ducky socks. #cbc #trudeau #canada
3979 2018-02-01 16:16:28 LMAO liiiike if a oil change can’t fix it then it’s no longer my priority 
3980 2018-02-01 16:16:23 Don’t get an Audi cause then you have to pay like $140 for an oil change lmao
3981 2018-02-01 16:16:21 #MyFirstVehicleWas pretty much indestructible. I'm pretty certain if I could find it right now all it would take is a quart of oil and a full gas tank to get it running again.

3983 2018-02-01 16:16:15 @BarstoolBigCat To be fair we build oil pipelines though everyone's back yards. We only cry the loudest when its through Native American's backyards.
3984 2018-02-01 16:16:13 How much upside do you think Oil has @KRooneyVera ?
3985 2018-02-01 16:16:11 spill “cleanup” is one of the biggest lies perpetrated by the oil and gas industry. there’s no such thing
3986 2018-02-01 16:16:05 A small amount is used in the vitamin D preparation to ensure that the product does not separate. This is sourced from palm kernel oil or coconut oil, or  a mixture of both. Fractionated vegetable oil is not hydrogenated and is quite safe at this level
3987 2018-02-01 16:16:04  what’s up at the fine nigga doing my oil change.
3988 2018-02-01 16:16:02  would that technically be oil? Or gas?
3989 2018-02-01 16:15:19 Well how about this leak... someone in a position of power is abusing said power for self gain.. lifting restrictions on dumping in rivers, cutting renewable energy funding, to make us dependant on oil and coal again.. all for MONEY does that sound about right...
3990 2018-02-01 16:15:13 You gotta moisturize that fro using the L.C.O or L.O.C method &do some Bantu knots or flat twists &love that fro!Use coconut oil or olive oil or even avocado oil to seal in the moisture.L-Liquid (water and or aloe Vera juice)C-Cream(whipped shea butter is good)O-oil
3991 2018-02-01 16:15:08 It is an industry standard - industry regulation - that any oil company employee could have told you. Given the prevalence of oil employees in the area, it would have been a simple task to find one to confirm. For due diligence.
3992 2018-02-01 16:15:04 otw na ako dyan sainyo ako maglalagay ng efficascent oil tapos uwi na ako hahahahahahaha
3993 2018-02-01 16:14:53 By snp you must mean half of scots voters
WM takes 92% of scots oil and gas wealth,so there is one good reason
Scots were lied to in 2 referendums
WM has squandered scots wealth,,is that enough reasons for you or would you like more?
3994 2018-02-01 16:14:50 I see your into mountain biking. Shame all those great places to ride will be gone after this administration gives land over to big oil for exploration, and lifts regulation on protecting the environment.
3995 2018-02-01 16:14:49 $NOA finally started repurchasing shares - they bought 177k shares early last week.  They seemed to have stopped for a few month - according to the company it was hard to find shares.  The cheapest energy services company but small, illiquid, and oil sands so people stay away
3996 2018-02-01 16:14:40 We'll have to sort something out. The oil isn't going to last forever!

3999 2018-02-01 16:14:10 Support for Scottish Independence remains firm in recent polling.

How could Brexit, plus a resurgent independence campaign, affect the position?

The British Government had better work harder on the oil pumps and extract as much wealth from Scotland as they can, before we leave.

4003 2018-02-01 16:13:54 Seen Kennett’s thread there and he’s largely right. The (valid) concern that people have is whether ‘steady accumulation’ is enough to sometimes come ahead of the competition. Think we’ll be pretty steady top 4 for the next few seasons and I don’t think it’s asking for oil money/

4015 2018-02-01 16:12:27 My understanding of flat earth nomenclature is that an “oil of magnitude” represents the exponentially increasing slippery slope needed for a flerfer to deny gravity until they fall off the edge.
4016 2018-02-01 16:12:26 So much "risk premium" attached to Brent price forecasts.

4019 2018-02-01 16:12:13 Then that must be conveyed to t ppl thru a press conference by oil minister. Why this clarification comes from social media. Bjp is doing fatal mistake by not conveying directly to the ppl of India the misdeeds of Italian aunty

4043 2018-02-01 16:09:02 I mean if you were smart enough to buy oil stocks in Feb 2016, your market position should be to slowly liquify your gains through 2018 while the market rebalances

4061 2018-02-01 16:07:23 I find it interesting that every long weekend, one by one, gas stations up their prices til they all are the same.  And yet the government claims no price fixing. 
Or how when there is a disaster that will slow oil production, gas prices immediately go up.

4065 2018-02-01 16:06:48 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
4066 2018-02-01 16:06:47 I am at that point where I'm actually using massage oil (coconut oil base) as lotion because I'm so goddamn ashy wtf
4067 2018-02-01 16:06:43 It took Obama eight years to clean up after Bush - bank deregulation caused world financial meltdown, how many wars did Chaney start, unmonitored oil drilling disasters in Gulf of Mexico, unqualified, unprepared FEMA Director during Katrina. How many years to recover from Trump?

4069 2018-02-01 16:06:07 The Benz needs an oil change...
4070 2018-02-01 16:05:49 BC will face consequences over plan to ban increased oil shipments
4071 2018-02-01 16:05:46 We need oil for everything. You want us to go back to caveman days but ban a fire for warmth to. Oh wait, you'd be a privileged politician that would have their own supply, we the people though would get screwed.
4072 2018-02-01 16:05:33 Damn! Those look badass!

4074 2018-02-01 16:05:08 It also helps that their median household income is $84,758 annually and their sales tax rate is 8.42%. It’s oil and gas money at its finest.
4075 2018-02-01 16:05:06 These rich Globalist bankers control over 70 percent of old age homes in North America. They are very prevalent in Edmonton. They are the oil rogue trader Glencore group who own Revera. They are on the CIA watch list. Google search Glencore you will see what old folks have

4077 2018-02-01 16:04:53 Story time: When I was about 12yrs old. I was tryna be a big man and fry some food innih so I'm out here in the kitchen just dropping some stuff in this hot hot oil, and it had the nerve to go right on my face. I had a big round burn spot for a long time. :( size of a 1p coin smh
4078 2018-02-01 16:04:41 ..
4079 2018-02-01 16:04:40 Sabana de torres! Used to work near in an oil facility long time ago, far away from my city to see your team in action. It's a shame...
4080 2018-02-01 16:04:39 Premier Notley has done absolutely nothing in 3 years for Albertans and especially to get our oil to tidewater. #1yrleft
4081 2018-02-01 16:04:33 Everyone has different opinions when it comes to oil changes. Check with your owner's manual before making a decision.  #carmaintenance
4082 2018-02-01 16:04:33 One day they’ll ask me what it was like to live through The Rise And Fall of Coconut Oil Era
4083 2018-02-01 16:04:23 You are arguing on a false premise. Let's imagine for a moment your ridiculous argument that Scottish independence depends on the oil price and reserves. What price and or reserves should trigger independence ? 
4084 2018-02-01 16:04:06 Ciao Andrea. Mi piacerebbe leggere una tua view su oil @StanzaniAndrea
4085 2018-02-01 16:04:06 International prices rose too... (tho they are on a rout right now. But some pundits are saying the rally might resume and oil might end up above 80 $/barrel)
4086 2018-02-01 16:03:50 Chutiye is tarah to India main bhi oil fields hain ,total oil reserve kitna hain Syria main bhadsve Google kar le ,aur afganstan main kya ho Raha hain randi ki aulad
4087 2018-02-01 16:03:48 With a bit of olive oil 
4088 2018-02-01 16:03:31 I ATE ALL THE CHILI OIL! _:(´ཀ`」 ∠):_
4089 2018-02-01 16:03:23 Osmo Oil is very good!
4090 2018-02-01 16:03:20 Using the title "Dr" whilst making medical claims when you're not an MD should be illegal. Too much risk of public being misled and real physical harm. The guy has an "accredited" essential oil online "university"!? A wothless certificate and some fake letters means nothing.
4091 2018-02-01 16:03:14 Boycotting palm oil in exchange for alternative solutions could actually cause more environmental damage. Stopping the production of palm oil altogether would also create significant problems for these people who rely upon this industry to support their families 1/2
4092 2018-02-01 16:03:13 maglagay ka ng efficascent oil dun sa gilid ng ulo mo tapos hilutin mo tapos magpahinga ka na
4093 2018-02-01 16:03:03 @SpeakerRyan imagine Trump’s Tax returns? And all oil investments?? And all swamp corruption and $$$$$! You don’t want @FBI to know that
4094 2018-02-01 16:03:03 I put it on after my gel moisturizer and before sunscreen (after which I use Whish’s primer or Smashbox’s oil primer, which is good for cold!) or night cream. It is cheap and smells good.
4095 2018-02-01 16:02:35 I'm gonna boil myself in oil
4096 2018-02-01 16:02:33 Cmon... yeen slick to a can of oil..
4097 2018-02-01 16:02:30 To be fair the older engine were more oil cooled than air cooled. Change is hard though!

4102 2018-02-01 16:02:01 @Koch_Industries @keithellison The Koch brothers are not the.major culprit of RNC financing. The major culprit is the tax funds spent on all business and sports teams. Most billionaires are really welfare addicts living off of tax funds. Koch industries doesnt own the oil and gas
4103 2018-02-01 16:01:37 You ever changed your oil chickenhoops?
4104 2018-02-01 16:01:33 I randomly got the taste of castor oil in my mouth and I ain’t even had that shit in years. Now I’m remembering how traumatizing that stuff is I’m so sad
4105 2018-02-01 16:01:31 Previously oil was transported over rails. Warren Buffett-owned rails in many cases. That’s why Buffett opposed the pipeline. Look what happened in Quebec when a rail car filled with oil had a collision.
4106 2018-02-01 16:01:27 Chhinal ki paidaish Syria ke oil reserve ke bare main Google kar le rand ke jane
4107 2018-02-01 16:01:17 drench everything in olive oil
4108 2018-02-01 16:01:07 At one end of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, there is a scene you must see to believe via @BIUK_Politics
4109 2018-02-01 16:01:02 so I switched to using unrefined coconut oil instead of refined for cooking and such and now all the food i make has a hint of coconut... anddd I think I’m okay with that.
4110 2018-02-01 16:01:00 Are you still in your oil shorts?
4111 2018-02-01 16:00:59 Why did #international #governments exert #pressure on #Turkey to withdraw after its #invasion into northern #Iraq (Operation Sun, 2008) but remain mum while #civilians are #killed in northern #Syria? Simple. #Oil is more important than #human lives. #Afrin #Kurds

4113 2018-02-01 16:00:37 SAD - America, the global leader in tech, has declared #WarOnScience .
Banning the CDC from using "fetus" and "science-based", appointing polluters to run the EPA, favoring oil/coal over renewable tech , and even denying #climatechange. (China on the other hand..)
4114 2018-02-01 16:00:36 Norway was very civilised with their oil. I believe Scotland has the will to do similar. I'm a fan
4115 2018-02-01 16:00:35 Not quite 4 oil paintings but welcome aboard chaps!
4116 2018-02-01 16:00:27 "Mind Frames" #Show Field Building Denver 5/12/18 You define the shape & color of your frame of mind.

4117 2018-02-01 16:00:10 How could one deny fossil fuels won't last forever? Do Trump and his supporters even understand how fossil fuels come to be? Forget the fact it pollutes the air and water.  End renewable energy programs for what, your oil buddies? Trump & his supporters are stupid.

4123 2018-02-01 15:59:41 
4124 2018-02-01 15:59:40 Oil change once I leave here
4125 2018-02-01 15:59:36 hahaha!!!! So true
4126 2018-02-01 15:59:21 Yay for watching the country willfully fall behind even further.  I look forward to the bleak corporate sponsored future brought to you by Murray Energy and Koch Industries.  Who needs a diverse energy efficient future when we can cover everything in coal and oil byproducts!
4127 2018-02-01 15:59:06 sore throat? Gargle tea tree oil water 

Does it work? Yes, ish 
Does it taste bad? Heck yes 
Would I recommend it? Probably not...

4128 2018-02-01 15:59:04 i love argan oil on my hair once it’s been freshly cut/straightened but whenever i use it then wash my hair, it always leaves a disgusting smell and i physically cannot cope
4129 2018-02-01 15:59:02 Still waiting for someone to tell me that coconut oil tastes better and is more satisfying than eating an avocado. COME ON people fiber & nutrients & Fat trumps MCTs everyday.
4130 2018-02-01 15:59:01 Dh la cleansing oil HL tu mahal. Klo beli time sale, berganda jimat tau 
4131 2018-02-01 15:58:53 without urrutia it will be more of the same...
4132 2018-02-01 15:58:45 Hi Emily, Palm oil is very popular for many reasons, although using other vegetable oils seems like a practical solution, it would create similar, if not larger, environmental & social problems. 1/2
4133 2018-02-01 15:58:39 Stupid arabs they are enough of oil now they want skins.... Amaizing world <3
4134 2018-02-01 15:58:29 Every time I take my car in for an oil change, they tell me something else needs to be replaced 
4135 2018-02-01 15:58:29 coconut oil is all you need.
4136 2018-02-01 15:58:17 I ran out of coconut oil 
4137 2018-02-01 15:58:09 Saudis has oil money to pay for infrastructure. Not so easy to tap into gravy train when public infrastructure is being built.
4138 2018-02-01 15:58:07 Oil axed at 40% so that nearly 5.5 million per diem into the treasury. That would be £2 billion in tax from one well.
My goodness me. Just think what Scotland could do with that money.
4139 2018-02-01 15:58:05 Tea tree oil is my god, the acne god 
4140 2018-02-01 15:58:00 Just got hit on by the hbcb that was changing my oil & he gave me his employee discount and he said he was gonna visit me at work tomorrow OMFG
4141 2018-02-01 15:57:58 Don jr shouldn’t you be worried about oil dripping down your hair? Why are you concerned with the fake news. You are way dumber than I give you credit for but then again you are trump’s son what do you expect right?
4142 2018-02-01 15:57:57 oil & gas money 
4143 2018-02-01 15:57:42 The USA is producing 10 million barrels of oil a day, the most since 1970 YES!   
4144 2018-02-01 15:57:23 @SpeakerRyan how about “cleaning” corruption in @HouseGOP ?? All of you with oil investments in #ANWR? We could start “cleaning” there!!!
4145 2018-02-01 15:57:19 oil jaw boning bulls set their sight on 66.66 probably some time next week, we have a squeeze there or not is the question.  #oott
4146 2018-02-01 15:57:15 ladies want me to notice you? post pcis covered in oil ..... that's it . SIMPLE
4147 2018-02-01 15:57:06 Just Like the Pound, Euro, oil and USD.
4148 2018-02-01 15:56:40 try to play me like a twitter artist and it wont work
brushes got the oil
hella wet, but it wont squirt..
4149 2018-02-01 15:56:37 The smell of valve oil makes me happy.
4150 2018-02-01 15:56:36 Sitting on a couch, scrolling through my Twitter timeline while waiting for my oil change, admiring tits and ass, and wondering why the mechanics keep having their conversations directly over my shoulder 
4151 2018-02-01 15:56:24 Don't worry, its all turning around. This silent war is OVER. Saudis are running out of oil. Thats why they a warmongering for pipelines. US has more oil than anyone. This is about power. Obamas dream to destroy the US has failed thanks to Trump and US military. GTMO awaits.
4152 2018-02-01 15:56:24 The list is extensive.  Here are a few:
The EPA is now led by someone who denies climate change.  
The new education secretary is defunding public schools to fund private, religious schools.
The sec of state, US’s chief diplomat, is an ex-oil exec with interests in Russian oil-
4153 2018-02-01 15:56:20 Boi u better eat a ton of berries, drink some lemon con sal y honey, drink some fish oil
4154 2018-02-01 15:56:06 What are the odds both my car and motorcycle are due for oil changes the same week lol
4155 2018-02-01 15:56:00 ..
4156 2018-02-01 15:55:56 I mean, he lies about EVERYTHING.  It's what snake oil salesmen DO.
4157 2018-02-01 15:55:54 قد تزدحم بك الآلام وتتكدر حياتك .. ويثقل الصمت أنفاسك .. حينها تذكر :
 {إِنَّمَا أَشْكُو بَثِّي وَحُزْنِي إِلَى اللَّهِ} 

ثم انثر الآلام في بحور الصبر .. 
وتذكر أن شعار السعادة دائما :
"الرضى بما يقدره الله"

4160 2018-02-01 15:55:37 it was a terrible speech very robotic with a little oil on the side
4161 2018-02-01 15:55:35 I'm honestly baffled it's this hard to understand it's the oil itself and not the additives. It's been said like four times. But people will say anything to keep making their money I guess, regardless if someone's pet dies from it.
4162 2018-02-01 15:55:31 A 1985 Honda Accord that had to have a quart of oil added to it every twenty minutes. #MyFirstVehicleWas
4163 2018-02-01 15:55:31 I was stopped out this trade for a loss --Goldman raises oil target to $82.50, weak dollar ----still think a pull back is on the horizon --but will admit the window is closing
4164 2018-02-01 15:55:31 I’m tired of y’all lathering ya face in coconut oil talking about “glowing skin”. You’re greasy, girl, not glowing.
4165 2018-02-01 15:55:27 I want to do an oil on canvas of your naked body.
4166 2018-02-01 15:55:26 News websites: crickets

News via Twitter: we got you girl. Farmers brought tractors downtown to protest against big oil companies. Here are some photos.

Twitter shouldnt replace official sources, but it sure helps give me peace when a chopper has been circling for an hour.
4167 2018-02-01 15:55:24 @dpradhanbjp :There should b some

4174 2018-02-01 15:54:17 Stay home. I’m currently in bed with the flu. Worst thing you can do is infect the community.  For the cold: Lots of warm fluids, zinc, echinacea, oregano oil, hot water and lemon, steam for throat and sinuses, chicken soup and rest.
4175 2018-02-01 15:54:13 my finger swelled up when i was asleep for some reason, now i can't get my ring off. i tried oil, lotion, soap, nothing is working. and the swelling won't go down omg.

4177 2018-02-01 15:54:04 They're on the take from big oil.
4178 2018-02-01 15:54:00 Maybe like fish oil in her bubble bath, something that she can wash off. Not her perfume! Lesson 1 lads: any prank on appearance/ with her beauty products/ clothes or shoes is NOT going to be found funny. She finna switch real quick!!

4180 2018-02-01 15:53:43 synthetically flavoured (although now it seems obvious!) so I'd definitely pick a synthetic one over real truffle oil I think, just in case.
4181 2018-02-01 15:53:36 I have apple cider on my scalp which I am supposed to leave for an hour, and then wash to put coconut oil pulak. Anything for my dying scalp.
4182 2018-02-01 15:53:32 I’m sure a set of @TamiyaUK buggy CVA dampers with 5wt oil and the thinnest springs imaginable would do the job.

4188 2018-02-01 15:52:55 Same lang na may therapeutic effect but you can’t use essential oils sa humidifier. Kailangan oil diffuser.
4189 2018-02-01 15:52:43 The problem is that there is so much 'associated gas' that producers will either flare (if they can) or give away at anything above $0.00 and consider it a win as long as oil prices are high....
4190 2018-02-01 15:52:43 Me neither but yeah it's definitely interesting! Thinking about it, it's a bit like horse riding - you're using the animal for human gain so technically exploiting them... but if they're also companion pet dogs then it's hard to draw a line. I didn't realise truffle oil was
4191 2018-02-01 15:52:42 Y’all running through these lames y’all better get that lil pussy a tune up or at least get it a lil oil change or sum

4195 2018-02-01 15:52:27 Fashion is the second highest producer of waste in the world, just behind oil. It doesn’t need to be like that but we’ve turned fashion into fast fashion and we go through it so quickly. Stop buying clothes you don’t need.
4196 2018-02-01 15:52:25 Great honest review of this gorgeous oil 
4197 2018-02-01 15:52:23 LOL when we had to get the oil changed in my brothers car and we basically had to do it ourselves

4208 2018-02-01 15:51:02 The oil sands care about the environment, too. Have you ever seen a reclaimed mine? It is gorgeous parkland, unlike the poisonous terrain which had been there. You do know oil seeps up from the ground there, right?
4209 2018-02-01 15:51:01 What do u use black seed oil for?
4210 2018-02-01 15:50:53 I miss the Twitter conversation about oil filters.
4211 2018-02-01 15:50:48 I'll get there! Lol. But that's only if the K04 on the car starts to burn oil. (By if I mean when x)
4212 2018-02-01 15:50:41 There are those who say that oil is a resource that we'll run out of but you know what is even more precious than that in this day n age? Sleep
4213 2018-02-01 15:50:32 ... that I may sleep soundly in Efficascent oil and soft sheets, in my mother's love, and time may not hurry
4214 2018-02-01 15:50:24 Thanks for the mention! MsWelshgurl: @Blonder_Blonder It’s thick, I use #schwarzkopf colour sealer treatment with #omegaplex it makes my hair more manageable.
4215 2018-02-01 15:50:23 Thanks for the mention! MsWelshgurl: @Blonder_Blonder Sadly not as easy to do it yourself after you’ve left a salon looking like this!

4219 2018-02-01 15:50:12 Saudi’s could crank more oil if they wanted. Doing Uncle Sam’s bidding holding the price per barrel down to punish Russia and Venezuela.

4235 2018-02-01 15:48:27 I am intrigued too. Can't afford truffles anyway, but I buy truffle oil (which is often synthetically flavoured).
4236 2018-02-01 15:48:14 then again, i am a huge advocate for black castor oil.
4237 2018-02-01 15:48:11 Bitumen is a lumpy soup of chemicals and tarry oil that coagulates in the marine environment and has demonstrated to be all but impossible to clean up in ideal conditions. Never mind after a typical Pacific storm. The onus is on KM and the feds to prove they can remediate a spill
4238 2018-02-01 15:47:53 i went back to using my Lotta Body conditioner and i stopped using it cause it didn't leave my hair feeling A1. however, i've reintroduced black castor oil into my routine, and baybeh, it works with that oil.
4239 2018-02-01 15:47:51 A ballon filled with helium floats because the air surrounding it has higher mass. That higher mass flows under it pushing it up (Think water and oil). Eventually it gets to a place where there pressure inside is greater than the pressure outside expanding the ballon till it pops
4240 2018-02-01 15:47:44 The tax breaks for oil and gas are to regulate the price of gas for everyone, to make travel and commerce affordable
4241 2018-02-01 15:47:43 US refiner Valero chief executive Joe Gorder: “Looking ahead, we continue to see a favorable fundamental environment, with abundant crude
oil supply and strong products demand being supported by global economic growth.”
4242 2018-02-01 15:47:15 Getting my oil change for 21$ and they include FOR FREE tire rotation, fluid fill, and a general inspection. AND there’s a keurig 
4243 2018-02-01 15:47:15 I couldn't careless about your nationlist argument. The topic is about oil revenue and how the SNP hopelessly overestimated revenue from oil.
4244 2018-02-01 15:47:08 Not so, many small businesses do it and a client of mine, many years ago, worked on oil rigs and was only paid out once a month. Totally legit, you just get a full months salary at once.
4245 2018-02-01 15:47:05 Gusto ko mag oil painting
4246 2018-02-01 15:47:04 Tillerson is in the Oil Business. So is Russia. Business trumps national security. Team Trump is about $ not about serving this nation
4247 2018-02-01 15:46:56 Exactly. We would be able to get our oil out. They would love our water, cattle , people.
4248 2018-02-01 15:46:30 Well said. Also financed wars, nuclear weapons, tax cuts and due to the Neo Liberal fetish for privatisation means we earn a comparative pittance (especially to Norway) from our oil resources now.

4253 2018-02-01 15:46:14 With a very long journey coming up, towing the caravan, I decided on having the cambelt replaced on my Land Rover a year or so earlier than suggested by the manufacturer.
Good shout, the garage just called to say an oil seal had gone and covered the existing belt in oil!
4254 2018-02-01 15:46:14 Fresh sets & pedicures cool, but that fresh oil change & tank filll up feels even better 
4255 2018-02-01 15:45:55 Es lo que pensamos, sobre todo R Tillerson (OIL) cuate de Putin que lo galardonó y, Trump, pues es un cero a la izquierda.

4265 2018-02-01 15:44:23 Oil surging again.  Twitter is universally bearish.
4266 2018-02-01 15:44:22 If you stay in Persia keeping the same policy, it would be legitimate wondering about the real reason of your presence in the Region. If it's about oil, You start sounding like "interested people".

4276 2018-02-01 15:43:39 Aren’t most of the projects of the past 20 years aimed at SAG-D? Even the robot trucks represent an obsolescent type of oil sands production.
4277 2018-02-01 15:43:29 Murphy: #energy outlook shows continue U.S. crude oil production thru 2018 as global demand grows to export petroleum products across the globe, not only Canada and Mexico but even beyond. #CFOutlook #cattlecon18 #beefmeet

4279 2018-02-01 15:43:17 As I said, you have a weird definition of Family, and if people bother you in Persia, feel free to join your cousins in Israel. But I'm afraid your attractiveness will be weakened without oil in your pocket.

4282 2018-02-01 15:43:02 When crude oil was $140/, domestic fossil fuels were sold at $60/. Th balance of $70/ was being paid by OMCs to OPEC nations from Govt Subsidy of Rs 2.5 lakh Cr per year. This money could've been used for many useful purposes.
4283 2018-02-01 15:42:54 I hate to say this but we already have the know how it's just we can't fight big oil company's

4311 2018-02-01 15:40:12 Exactly! I read today, that Canadian oil companies are moving their rigs to USA & Suncor is cutting 400 jobs with self driving trucks in the patch. Time for Alberta to start thinking beyond the oil box. Big Oil is not your friend.
4312 2018-02-01 15:40:09 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
4313 2018-02-01 15:40:06 Unfortunately slowly isn't gonna be enough to save our planet :( Lots of other places have strong economies without relying on oil. We have so much else going for us in Alberta, we can do it too! May not be easy but neither is living on a dead planet.

4315 2018-02-01 15:39:24 That expected price increase results from the global market. Strong global demand for oil could drive prices this year up to $70 per barrel, with a floor price of $45-50, says CattleFax analyst Mike Murphy. #beefmeet #cattlecon18

4318 2018-02-01 15:39:17 Also, got some Moska Oil and put it into a travel spray bottle to spray on my roots and such to see where that takes my hair journey.  I used to use it in my early 20s because my friends mother told me to.

4328 2018-02-01 15:37:43 Checklist for being financially responsible:
Stop profiting from war and exploitation. Stop ripping off native land and shoving pipelines through it. Stop funding offshore sweatshop labor. And stop financing oil and coal extraction, it’s not really very hard.

4337 2018-02-01 15:36:42 No benefits of Crude oil prices. No benefits in Income tax. No benefits in any sphere of our life cycle. Are the middle class not part of Indian society. Are we born just to pay taxes and keep looking at benefits being rolled out only to the corporates or the poor. Just pathetic

4342 2018-02-01 15:36:27 Oil?  Yeah, those major companies aren't coming here anymore either.
4343 2018-02-01 15:36:26 Why would the Chinese wish to trade with British Colombia when the government in Victoria wishes to block a means for China to clean up their environment LNG and Alberta OIL ?
4344 2018-02-01 15:36:25 Conventional oil is getting more and more expensive. You don't develop oil sands project for today, you build it with a 10-30 year time horizon. By then, all conventional oil will be exhausted. Also, energy independence. Middle east oil could disappear overnight.
4345 2018-02-01 15:36:19 And oil up those sticky keys
4346 2018-02-01 15:36:01 Why is it a thing to put coconut oil on your face ? 
4347 2018-02-01 15:35:41 DONT GIVE IN TO DREAD - Like changing your oil every 3000 miles or going for an annual check up, dealing with dread in the early stages will help you avoid problems down the road.  Joyce Meyer,  Read Psalm 27:1
4348 2018-02-01 15:35:19 that means they are long and don't want to see it drop after the huge oil build yesterday
4349 2018-02-01 15:35:03 Anybody else remember when the "evil oil men" were in office, & we could somehow still afford gas? #goodtimes #p2 #p21 #topprog #Obama2012
4350 2018-02-01 15:34:59 Mike Murphy, CattleFax, explains we are producing more oil even as less rigs are in production; the improvements in efficiency are tremendous. The U.S. should be on track to produce 10 million barrels/day by end of 2018. #beefmeet #cattlecon18
4351 2018-02-01 15:34:27 You citing CNN is a lot like snake oil salesmen citing "testimonials" of the cured. A slight, let's call it, credibility gap. I no longer allow my students to cite CNN w/o additional backup. Big change in my practices this semester since CNN used 2b reliable.

4361 2018-02-01 15:33:46 MacGyver would fix this with twenty bottles of olive oil, a haunted drinking straw and his trusty Swiss Army knife.
4362 2018-02-01 15:33:43 My Daddy was so old school he would warm Castor Oil on the stove and make us take a spoonful while we were sick...  that’s a different kind of laxative

4370 2018-02-01 15:33:01 That is true, I grew up in a small farming town in Michigan. My Dad would help anyway possible, He let me use a tractor for collateral to get my first lone to set up a welding and machine shop. I catered to the oil and gas drilling companies. I was 14 years old. true story.
4371 2018-02-01 15:32:52 Can we for once admit that Buhari has failed in the oil sector? Woefully. — feeling sad
4372 2018-02-01 15:32:51 I am a bit confused- on the one hand the CD Howe says pipeline capacity is the critical make or break- but then says market forces are ultimately the deciding factor on Tar sands oil future.? So what is it?
4373 2018-02-01 15:32:08 #MyFirstVehicleWas a black 2002 Hyundai Elantra GT. I got it in 2009 and drove it until 2016. By the end it leaked oil so on the engine so bad I'd pull up to @RockinPikachu's place in a cloud of smoke.

4396 2018-02-01 15:29:14 My girlfriend said my cauliflower ear was gross so I drizzled olive oil on it and put it in the oven at 450° for 25 minutes. This has been a roast joke.

4420 2018-02-01 15:26:34 Very true. Attaching our economy to fossil fuels is backwards thinking and has been for quite some time. If there wasn’t such a rich and powerful lobby for oil/gas/coal I don’t imagine we would be having this conversation. Even nuclear is a better long run option vs fossil.

4428 2018-02-01 15:25:52 @nursechevcaddy. Brought my cruze in for an oil change and they ignored to vacuum my car. I was not happy at all. I got no explanation.  home. Any way  If Iam spending over $80 I expect a good service and what I got today was crappy. I need an explanation. I need my car vaccumed.
4429 2018-02-01 15:25:51 Trying CBD oil latley and am having good results. I encourage anyone who struggles with depression or anxiety to at least give it a try. Its hard to do this alone.
4430 2018-02-01 15:25:40 figured you might, just mentioning it in case you missed a thing or two because you're out of town when something nasty gets slid by (like sliding in opening up AK for oil drilling in a tax bill,... pretty sneaky). Cheers.

4432 2018-02-01 15:25:39 You know, David, I've had the exact same thing happen to me, except even luckier. My timing belt once broke right as I pulled into the shop for an oil change. As Lou Gehrig said, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

4435 2018-02-01 15:25:15 Surfactants are just molecules with a water loving part and oil loving part.

Found everywhere. Our body even produces is own surfactants so we can live and breath and run and jump.

E.g. all newborns would die without lung surfactant production. Clever babies.

4443 2018-02-01 15:24:27 ... oil is not the same as coal, and while gasoline is derived from oil, you don't know whether or not we have electric cars. In fact, you don't know much of anything, because we both have jobs?

4464 2018-02-01 15:22:14 Ultrasound on legs the other week seems to show arterial plaque. Lovely. Aspirin, fish oil, borage oil, ACE inhibitors haven’t prevented it. Probably because I have type 1 diabetes since 1970 and I’m overweight.

4480 2018-02-01 15:20:23 @RachelNotley “The government of Alberta will not — we cannot — let this unconstitutional attack on jobs and working people stand," she said before the closed-door meeting”re: BC to ensure oil spill readiness on west coast. Notley is Canada’s Trump. She is total puppet of big oil

One of the main reasons why you find yourself frustrated is because you keep trying to pour fresh oil into contaminated vessels!
4486 2018-02-01 15:19:29 Next week I really need to get up on my off day and get an oil change

4493 2018-02-01 15:18:53 is that an oil or a serum
4494 2018-02-01 15:18:46 The entire anti oil movement was to move to liberal interests destroy industry in the hands of conservative interests 

Politically & emotionally driven environmentalism is bad for earth
Just look at the acres of natural landscape now cluttered  with metal solar monstrosities
4495 2018-02-01 15:18:41 Boomers jeer millennials for not being able to change car oil (many boomers cannot do this either) but can't update windows lmao 
4496 2018-02-01 15:18:39 So when do the #abndp lawyers show up in court to file an injunction and when does @RachelNotley stop authorizing oil shipments to #BC... #AllTalk...
4497 2018-02-01 15:18:35 our dog is getting old and we're giving him anything we can to help with aging (that doesn't kill the environment, hence, buying phytoplankton, which is an alternate to Fish Oil pills) 
4498 2018-02-01 15:18:29 There is no oil in Afghanistan. However, it is well known that Afghanistan is rich in minerals and of course there are drugs for the CIA to traffic.
4499 2018-02-01 15:18:28 The values of the Tory govt are not those of Scotland. That is why we don't vote for them. In addition, the resources of Scotland (including oil), have been plundered and wasted  to support the infrastructure of the SE of England. We have had enough.
4500 2018-02-01 15:18:08 How much is actual profit of oil and gas if our tax dollars stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry?  I bet not much.
4501 2018-02-01 15:18:00 My baby finally got an oil change 
4502 2018-02-01 15:17:57 Turkey has got no oil and gas
4503 2018-02-01 15:17:47 No it is wrong the oil interests or not central. The fake money printing while still conveying the myth that their money implies value is the real kicker.
4504 2018-02-01 15:17:39 The first thing I smelled on American soil was McDonald's french fry oil.

4507 2018-02-01 15:17:24 @DrAseemMalhotra hi pls cld u look into punjabi-north Indian sikh village diet.all grandfolks lived long/good life.ate chicken once a wk except ladies who seem non veg dairy,eggs,veg,spices,pulses,3 meals a day.used ghee &cooked in mustard oil(made frm own crops)low in potat.
4508 2018-02-01 15:17:15 So I take it that any transfer payments from Alberta oil could be kept in Alberta, since other provincial governments can ignore Federal law.
4509 2018-02-01 15:16:57 The delivery of oil and oil products to #NorthKorea should not be reduced, Moscow’s ambassador to Pyongyang was cited as saying by RIA news agency on Wednesday, adding that a total end to deliveries would be interpreted by North Korea as an act of war.
4510 2018-02-01 15:16:55 Why not baked style like a potato chip. Ki da like Boston Pizza. Then you don't have the oil on them and helps both sides of healthy and non-healthy.

Her car: I want an oil change
4518 2018-02-01 15:16:07 It’s a racket. Billions in oil and gas subsidies paid for with our tax dollars is the only reason the industry stays afloat. Actual cost of oil and gas is hidden.
4519 2018-02-01 15:16:05 Coconut oil is easily my favorite beauty hack tool
4520 2018-02-01 15:16:01 Artistic rejection is like taking cod liver oil; they say it’s good for you, you know they’re right, but it can be still tough to swallow.

4525 2018-02-01 15:15:39 @NicolaSturgeon You have the mandate.
There have been several "material change in circumstances".
There is a plan to remove powers from Holyrood.
Brexit will make Scotland demonsterably poorer.
Our EU friends are leaving in droves.
Apparently, we have some oil
Get on with it!
4526 2018-02-01 15:15:37 The fascists cashed up on the extra revenue pocketed by not reducing fuel prices when global oil prices fell to record lows.

4528 2018-02-01 15:15:16 I'm sure Google can be persuaded to follow the Oil Company model: move low value operations to Middle East, take a giant subsidy from the government, laugh all the way to bank after five-ten years when they stop ops because of 'political instability.'

4532 2018-02-01 15:14:54 We should call it the Oil and Gas industry’s war with the FBI. The GOP are just paid stooges protecting Putin and Pricing fixing at all costs. They in a war with renewables for a Trillion dollar market.
4533 2018-02-01 15:14:54 Of the 350,000MT of Palm kernel oil (PKO) consumer in Nigeria, 15,000MT was imported.

4536 2018-02-01 15:14:44 So 45’s WH cuts R&D funding for new renewable energy tech in order to to allow big oil huge R&D advantage in renewables and leave US behind rest of industrialized nations. 45 is getting a payoff from beneficiaries. It’s the mob way of biz

4541 2018-02-01 15:14:24 I am contemplating making jalapeno poppers for my Super Bowl "party," (which, to be perfectly honest, will be just me sitting in front of the television with a bunch of snacks), but hot oil terrifies me so I'll probably just buy the frozen kind and heat them up in the oven.
4542 2018-02-01 15:14:20 With domestic oil production rising steadily to record levels, why are gas prices going up all the sudden? #MAGA
4543 2018-02-01 15:14:16 There are policies in place to slowly get us off fossil fuels and some day we will. The economy will dictate exactly when that happens. We can’t just shut down oil production and exports tomorrow or even in the next 50 years. That would literally cripple our economy. Come on!

4557 2018-02-01 15:13:00 Be careful, I've heard essential oils can hurt you as well if you absorb it through your skin (cinnamon oil, at least).
4558 2018-02-01 15:12:56 I heard an ad on the radio wondering if they should do an environmental assesment for oil and gas in one area.
Like...you would think thats a given.
4559 2018-02-01 15:12:55 Bacon strips I think would be called. I have supplements, even have vegetarian "fish" oil .  I still eat milk and eggs (I'm not vegan). So I get all that I need.

4565 2018-02-01 15:12:47 EIA says US oil production topped 10 million barrels a day in November 2017, second-highest monthly total ever and most since 1970.
4566 2018-02-01 15:12:42 "You're not a proper granola mom until you own patchouli oil"-- me justifying buying just one more essential oil....no judging you bastards.
4567 2018-02-01 15:12:25 Oregano oil. It’s super nasty, but it seems to kill germs like nobody’s business
4568 2018-02-01 15:12:17 I see that way too much. this is not because of some god. it is because of oil, money, land, war, power over regular citizens to enrich themselves and enslave Americans.
4569 2018-02-01 15:12:02 Half the world will catch up with the American railcar of 1890. Where GM, Steel, Oil, and Asphalt companies worked together to buyout, cut down routes and promote the automobile. Maybe a stretch but plausible based on known history.
4570 2018-02-01 15:12:01 In case Russia replace 20% of wheat crops with oilseeds, it will stay #1 in wheat & shift Ukraine to #2 in vegoils - Fat-and-Oil Union of Russia - @Agroinvestor
4571 2018-02-01 15:12:00 Is it also important to distinguish local/global, particularly when discussing welfare? No expert, but higher global energy prices can be beneficial to an energy-exporting country, right? So oil prices below a certain point short-term "bad" for exporter if kills production jobs?

4598 2018-02-01 15:09:57 Despite oil prices hitting $70 per barrel, stocks in the oil and gas sector have yet to follow with their own cost increase. Speculators fear oil prices are artificially high due to months of supply cuts from OPEC #oilandgas #stocks #supply #investors #fear #costs #ENN
4599 2018-02-01 15:09:54 Just out of curiosity, isn't plastic a by product from processing oil into a useable fuel? So if they ban plastic, then that by product becomes waste. I was under the impression that we were to become more efficient with our resources.

4623 2018-02-01 15:07:14 Went in for an oil change and they come out telling me I need brakes, shocks, an air filter, and have an oil leak. 
4624 2018-02-01 15:07:00 The difficulty of monetizing #data is that it has become commoditized. It’s rarely discussed, but Rockefeller and Standard Oil became behemoths not b/c they owned the oil but b/c they controlled oil pipelines and then the railroads. - @ddewolf  at @outsellinc #datamoney

1st- half dozen drops of eucalyptus oil in boiling water and breathe vapours under a towel
2nd - saline solution for nasal passages (homemade)

Wish you some relief 
4630 2018-02-01 15:06:35 I just ordered a gallon tub of coconut oil to make some wine soap with. Sometimes I feel like a total weirdo when shopping for soap making supplies
4631 2018-02-01 15:06:34 I bet @RachelNotley uses the BC pipeline situation to implement more regulations on Alberta Oil and Gas industry

4637 2018-02-01 15:05:52 Yup - at least 10 years ago maybe 8 I had this chat with my uncle who is a geologist (britnat). He told me they’ve found 100’s of Wells not ready to start extraction until the wells that are already opened are finished. We’re swimming in oil.

4639 2018-02-01 15:05:40 Ok A) employees in the oil industry, especially ones in a facility like that, would all wear H2S monitors on their person, making that question moot. Info which you easily could have found

4658 2018-02-01 15:03:33 Compare how much the federal government gives the veterans to how much it gives to the oil and gas industry. Then tell me how much the GOP and Trump care.
4659 2018-02-01 15:03:33 That means if shale production growth drops tomorrow then the price of OIL will be enormous.
4660 2018-02-01 15:03:22 I got out of work at 7:40am, and got home after the vet by 9:30. I’ve slept for 30 min...the oil delivery lady knocks on the door and when I answer goes, “sorry to wake you, man I wish I got to sleep in this late too...” sis u best get off my porch 
4661 2018-02-01 15:03:22 Two facts about our vasayo core complete Omega.

4671 2018-02-01 15:02:41 IMO, I don't think the bike industry (even the "big" companies) have enough $ or influence among the general population to move the needle in any significant way. Oil/gas/auto is where the $ is and they should pay to make roads safer.

4702 2018-02-01 14:59:38 What utter garbage. When SLAB were in charge, Scotland had the poorest regions in Europe. At the height of the oil boom, Glasgow had slums which would have shamed a 3rd world country. Have Corbyn in England and leave us alone.
4703 2018-02-01 14:59:32 @sundayriley I've had my Flora oil for awhile and I just started to notice that its turned to a gel consistency, has it gone bad? It doesnt havent a different smell

4705 2018-02-01 14:59:20 The only silver line which I could draw is that UPA had the luxury to bear the fruits of seeds sown by NDA1, while that was not much of a case this ti,e around. Oil prices played their role, other than that, much was in shambles.
4706 2018-02-01 14:59:16 Hey Don, Shell Oil just announced an increase of 140% in profits for last year. In my town prices at the pump keep going up, .50 more a gallon than last summer's peak price. That low price you took credit for.

4711 2018-02-01 14:58:34 First of all, the oil industry doesn't produce anything, it extract. When it extracts faster - like now - it eats up the future that much faster.

4719 2018-02-01 14:57:36 No you're right. It's not the entire western world. But automotive companies refuse to innovate and keep putting out the same shit. They could easily come up with a low pollution vehicle that would follow the Paris agreement. But won't because of the oil industry.
4720 2018-02-01 14:57:35 You are right... NDA was hugely benefitted from the low fuel prices during the initial years of there term.. which added in the GDP... they royally fucked that advantage by Demi & gst.. now oil prices are rising & that will bring the GDP down.. sad!!

4753 2018-02-01 14:53:59 Fresh out the shower and whole body covered in coconut oil 
4754 2018-02-01 14:53:55 Kuj b nai krti ab to

4755 2018-02-01 14:53:53 Barca Vrs Valencia on the box at 3.30pm, we might actually see decent football after yesterdays awful Utd display.
Bells Two Hearted on special for $3. Massive thanks to all who braved the cold last night for trivia, great turnout.
60 Degrees today, grab the Baby Oil......
4756 2018-02-01 14:53:39 The big oil companies are mostly owned by ETFs, pensions, endowments, and foundations.
4757 2018-02-01 14:53:27 Does he light an oil lamp at night to go to the bathroom? Does he live on a whaling vessel?
4758 2018-02-01 14:53:26 So yol don't care that your numbers are stored as Engine Oil,as long as you fucking our man huh, ni brave Shem bo shell v power
4759 2018-02-01 14:53:24 So I took my car to the shop thinking I just needed an oil change...noooooooo I need almost $2,000 worth of repairs done  every time...every freakin time
4760 2018-02-01 14:53:23 Looks like #Brent #crude #oil has weathered the predictable burp after this rally's first peek above $70/bbl. #OPEC & allies comply (or comply via lack of performance), so prices will shuffle higher in search of the price point that sparks a demand response (recession)?
#OOTT
4761 2018-02-01 14:53:13 Sorry #BCbeer but I will be boycotting your delicious hoppy beer until your government stops being dumb with our oil. @phillipsbeer @FernieBrewingCo @Parallel49Beer @steelandoak @LighthouseBeer @driftwoodbeer just to name a few.
4762 2018-02-01 14:53:06 Not just from $20 to $80. This has taken 2 years for WTI to get from the mid 20s to the mid 60s.  Oil (WTI) going up to the mid 70s would be normal as it is a volatile commodity.  IMHO  
4763 2018-02-01 14:52:57 There won't be much tech there after they have ran out of oil.
4764 2018-02-01 14:52:46 pakshet ka may halong virgin coconut oil with extra pearls ang choco syrup gago
4765 2018-02-01 14:52:40 Get some Clove Oil, place it on a cutip and rub it on the base of the tooth.
Get it from HEB, Vitamins store, Wal-Mart or Walgreens.
4766 2018-02-01 14:52:27 On a cosmic scale, their 100 yr measurements r proof of man made climate change?
These r conartists, profiteers pseudoscience experts....snake oil salesmen...to THEM we say: fkoff

4768 2018-02-01 14:52:25 GOD IS GOD, King of kings and Lord of hosts... Yahweh. Elohim etc. 

Trump a deceptive snake oil salesman. And you've been conned. I hope the golden calf he paid his supporters, brings you lots of happiness 
4769 2018-02-01 14:52:16 try some @doterracanada peppermint oil! It really works for me.
4770 2018-02-01 14:52:14 For sale US presidency bankers, big pharma, oil companies will get special consideration
4771 2018-02-01 14:52:13 Very few macro manipulations are prosecuted & they may remain undetected for many years, even decades. Current oil market manipulation has been under way for at least 15 years (with the odd blip)

4776 2018-02-01 14:51:31 Also, we’re going to need something to fund the build up of renewables. Realistically oil seems the best bet for that. And I say that as one who hates the ostentatious waste of burning fossil fuels.
4777 2018-02-01 14:51:29 It's called peak oil !!!!
4778 2018-02-01 14:51:23 Tarte maracuja oil ni terbaik ea? Apa function ea?

4791 2018-02-01 14:50:04 But your not allowed to vape flowers in Fla. only the low grade oil they charge way too much for.
4792 2018-02-01 14:50:03 What did we regulate? Under the bush admin, Cheney let the oil industry write the clean water act. That's why they're exempt from it.
4793 2018-02-01 14:49:50 Reminder:  John D. Rockefeller managed to profit from the break-up of Standard Oil.....
4794 2018-02-01 14:49:50 when your dad brings your car back with 4 new tires, a new inspection sticker, changed oil & it’s spotless inside and out...

4799 2018-02-01 14:49:22 Neil does not mind killing a few gays. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that throw our  off buildings. Protesting Kinder Morgan = killing  @vancouverpride
4800 2018-02-01 14:49:20 I suspect Rachel Notley will use this battle with British Columbia to push for *more* oil sands regulations. 

I'm sure the NDP believe we're just not social licensing hard enough yet.

4806 2018-02-01 14:48:56 Bio Diesel Please...back up to Mcky Ds and get fuel cheap. Local people could start companies if regs are relaxed. Under a dollar a gallon and gets rid of waste cooking oil.
4807 2018-02-01 14:48:54 You made a mistake about why Oil Drill rigs from Canada to USA its because of Trumps tax cuts and incentives to drill. Fixed it for you a pro Trump story Losers
4808 2018-02-01 14:48:50 I once had a potential car buyer phone me and ask why the gauge was displaying no oil pressure in the dash shot. The engine wasn't running. I had to explain why these things were related.

4824 2018-02-01 14:47:01 Hearing this AM from @McKinsey about the opportunity space for #oil cos from #innovative #digital #tech. Key takeaway - new tech can improve SAFETY and COST performance. Also, enable more flexible, resilient teams.

4828 2018-02-01 14:46:39 The more we likely answer is it’s your genetics. Coconut oil is a comedogenic.
4829 2018-02-01 14:46:36 Please fix your fries. Y r they black? Change oil or change potato.
4830 2018-02-01 14:46:34 8% of our own oil is what scots get,labour hid scots wealth from them then dicided 8% was a fair share!
Do you think England would ever accept a shite deal like that for itself?

4832 2018-02-01 14:46:13 Oil and Gas are allowed to explore as far as I know.

Last year was my first year at the turbot so it's all new to me, do a lot of people go below 500? I know the crowd here don't.
4833 2018-02-01 14:46:06 @AdamMancini4 Hi Adam, enjoy your posts. Are you able to share your top TSX listed oil stock picks? I am also based in Canada and want to keep my funds in Canadian $. I am also aware of the XEG and ZJO ETFs. Are you in these ETFs? TIA

4850 2018-02-01 14:44:33 Like 2 weeks ago an oil rig blew up in Oklahoma anything like that prices always go up. Also in winter gas is heavier it's like 9 ish pounds per gallon and in summer it's like 7-8 ish per gallon so That's another reason.
4851 2018-02-01 14:44:30 I don't think it's quite as effective.  There's something special about argan oil that seems to work wonders.  Any dermatological injuries clear up rapidly.

4853 2018-02-01 14:44:26 : One cylinder costs Rs 780, deposited back in Indian Bank with Indian Oil - Rs 120,

That is, 780 - 120 = 660 rupees
Earlier, we got a cylinder of Rs 460,
Meaning total loss of Rs 200
Now it is to know that the money I got was back to me. Then where did the money of subsidy go..
4854 2018-02-01 14:44:17 Ofc African leaders n voters r also 2 blame but the main problem is Africa is still colonised via IMF n world banks systems.the colonisers go 2 Libya,destroy it n then issue loans 2 Libya while they get oil wealth.libya has 2 comply coz they in debt 4 ever.think pls Dave.

4873 2018-02-01 14:42:49 Inb4 you’re told that your tax money is currently being spent aggressing foreign countries that haven’t even sniffed us all because we want their oil. You really DON’T understand how broken America is, do you?
4874 2018-02-01 14:42:46 Like I said before, different things work for different people! Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin looking as clear/blemish-free as it does!
4875 2018-02-01 14:42:46 Maaaaan 2k does have issues but graphics and players looking like them selves. Unlike nba live players looking like they just got out a pool of baby oil and shit

4881 2018-02-01 14:42:15 Most of Donald Trump's supporters can't read or write or know the difference between wrong and right so this is just like going to church for them. He's kind of like a Hellfire and brimstone Evangelical. Dumb as f*** and hooked on the snake oil
4882 2018-02-01 14:42:09 Technically a kosher wash takes about a hour to wash and dry. They use an air driven spinner with 200 water that rotates inside the trailer for 30 minutes to kill all things and clean. Mostly vegetable oil of all varieties, dairy, sweetners, molasses, different flavor of juices.
4883 2018-02-01 14:42:06 We need big oil to transition to non fossil fuel based energy ASAP AND NOW!

4886 2018-02-01 14:41:28 I think Trump envisions all out war int he Middle East allowing the US to justify entering anywhere and grabbing oil, etc. Especially, "etc.".

4896 2018-02-01 14:40:55 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
4897 2018-02-01 14:40:54 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
4898 2018-02-01 14:40:27 Only because Nunes burned the midnight oil with creative editing

4905 2018-02-01 14:40:07 OK if you say so. Given how promotional UKOG are I'm sure they'd let us know if a tanker had picked up oil. However you believe what you want. I really don't mind.

All of my products are made with natural ingredients, no preservatives, no parabens. Most are oil based.
4922 2018-02-01 14:38:52 Hello sir @paddyadenuga84, your article is inspiring. Despite the outcome of the bid, you are a winner and it took guts and a lot of heart; the stuff of great achievers. Please be my mentor abeg, I have similar dreams!. Our oil and gas sector needs more people like you.

4928 2018-02-01 14:37:58 It's possible to draw attention to the change in BP's attitude without necessarily agreeing that extracting all the oil is a good thing. 
And the point we really want to get across is that @Zarkwan is an excellent resource.

4934 2018-02-01 14:37:32 My poor Chevy Cruze has surgery today hole in the oil pan, purge valve replacement, and a new water outlet. Dont worry little one you will be strong again
4935 2018-02-01 14:37:21 Now government has also been forced to relax fiscal deficits. And with oil where it is, cant expect them to be too expansionary. So budget is not bad. But 2019 wont be easy at all
4936 2018-02-01 14:37:17 yes my spirit was out of the body at the gulf oil spil, churnobal, the huricanes and the hole in the cole and the ship that had a misfire with a keg of powder

BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS: bio oil is fantastic!
4940 2018-02-01 14:36:51 Nicaragua, Panama, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Lybia. We topple their leaders then install a puppet to do our bidding in oil, narcotic traffic, and geopolitics We have funded wars fought by dictators like Saudi Arabia, but we also armed the rebels when it suits us like the Kurds.
4941 2018-02-01 14:36:35 I never thought that #crude oil price prediction is so simplistic. I want to see every commodity price prediction from #GoldmanGreat now...
4942 2018-02-01 14:36:32 Yes even put baby oil in my bath water .
4943 2018-02-01 14:36:19 The IEA predicted earlier this month that the U.S. is on pace pull ahead of Saudi Arabia, which last year produced just shy of 10 million barrels a day, and will vie with Russia, with output of 11 million barrels a day, to become the world’s top oil producer.
4944 2018-02-01 14:36:17 Plz read Soil Not Oil then attend our educational conference in September in San Francisco. One year we can save the planet if everyone plants organic.

4973 2018-02-01 14:33:04 It's not a serious allergy. 'May contain' and 'contains' make a difference to us. Any chance you can disclose what it is? Lecithin? Flour? Oil? Does it come after 'salt' on the ingredient list?

4990 2018-02-01 14:30:57 Not likely. That’s sounds comforting. We’re only dealing with @SecretaryZinke & this awful @WhiteHouse’s view on the natural environment.  Better hope they never find oil in the area or it’s a wrap, and you know it.  Btw, did he ask about MA or ME - funny thing about the horizon.

Far more oil than Scotland.

The economy is so bad they pay the police with toilet rolls.
5012 2018-02-01 14:29:08 According to Econ101, any market that sells an identical, non-distinguishable product in perfect competition with other sellers should be 0% profit. Only way that doesn't happen is a gov't price floor or industry collusion. And oil's pretty profitable.

5024 2018-02-01 14:27:59 @MarkBaileyMP io you forgot car driving, getting out of bed, going into bathrooms, climbing ladders and trees.

5042 2018-02-01 14:25:20 lots of support for ASSK for 15 years but wasn't that when Kofi was head of the UN? And oddly he gets a Commission formed on the request of ASSK to cover for her? For him to broker oil deal with China? For him to help prop her back up in justification and legitimizing? troubling!

5049 2018-02-01 14:24:42 This is a big issue.  NAFTA is a serious variable for US agriculture, and if it remains in flux, combined with a WH favouratism to oil versus bio-fuel, it could have enormous impact on corn.

5060 2018-02-01 14:22:54 Sarah, we've watched this ongoing saga all of our lives (I'm 66 YO). I have always looked forward to improved technologies and cleaner energy alternatives...not so with the oil barons and people who refuse to move forward!
5061 2018-02-01 14:22:50 As always Sanders is totally wrong....the one thing these guys knows is competition.....if you take the profit out of things these guys would be gone.
What it will involve is taking the middle man out to handle things such as check ups and minor prescription....akin to oil change
5062 2018-02-01 14:22:48 Wow! That is a love note. Although with such reliance on oil as a percent of the budget and they do have significant refining capacity (unlike Venezuela) I think they could weather the sanctions, growth would be anemic to negative.

5067 2018-02-01 14:22:22 It has everything to do with taxes and regulation, as well as a public image of oil sands being dirty, which is absolutely not true. As for low cost, Cenovus claims it can produce a barrel of oil sands crude via SAGD at $11. I call that low cost.

5072 2018-02-01 14:21:30 They can remove more oil than in the past.  That makes the DDGS less valuable to pigs since it will be primarily a replacement for soybean meal.

5077 2018-02-01 14:21:00 Good a booming economy requires a lot more oil. they better get to pumping cause i've gotten used to better prices. besides if the price goes up to much it could start biting the recovery in the ass.
5078 2018-02-01 14:20:58 @owakabi1 Read your piece on veg oil industry in East African of 4/16. Do you still follow this? Especially Bidco and Wilmar and the political economy of this sector.

5082 2018-02-01 14:20:28 That change happened a few years ago when the plants began removing the oil. Without a doubt that changed the value of the DDGS in pig rations.

5120 2018-02-01 14:17:07 Nice series of comments. Oil and boomer demographics are neglected aspects of our economic debates. UK deficits are part of financialization. Most offshore financial centres have huge per capita debts. I don't approve but if OK for Malta why not UK?

5124 2018-02-01 14:16:34 @JonErlichman In the battle over KM Pipeline the critical need to curb fossil fuel burning is being minimized. Canada is failing to meet its Paris commitments. More pipe will just lock in more oil consumption. EV/Hybrids sold in 2017 Norway 50% vs 1% in Canada. 1/2...

5134 2018-02-01 14:15:33 Great news.  Never understood why, when the USA had oil, we were always buying it from other countries.  That’s how globalists wanted it.  Great having a president who works for the USA and not other countries now.

5138 2018-02-01 14:15:12 The other thing I will say about Alaska is that the power base is already there. People support oil extraction in part because it's a small population where a significant portion make their money in extraction (either you or someone you know). So signal/noise ratio is tricky.

5147 2018-02-01 14:14:45 Great for her to be angry, but will she do anything about it? I doubt it. Frankly we should tax all oil and gas shipments to BC through our pipelines. How about $1.00/litre to start. Great way to pay down our debt as well.

5157 2018-02-01 14:14:02 Refined oil is much safer to transport and cleanup.  If Alberta doesn’t want to refine the raw bitumen (which is the most dangerous type of oil to transport because it’s nearly impossible to cleanup) then BC should decline increasing the amount coming to our shores.

5248 2018-02-01 14:05:55 Technically, there are “clean” and “dirty” coals, like there are “sweet” and “sour” crude oils.  For oil, it refers to the sulfur content. It’s similar for coal, where it references other components of the coal that can be considered contaminants and that burn with the coal.

5357 2018-02-01 13:55:57 Pepsi buys half a million metric tons of palm oil per year to make its products -  a major reason why oil palm plantations currently cover more than 27 million hectares of the Earth’s surface.  Correct labeling = more choice!
5358 2018-02-01 13:55:49 Wall Street bankers profit from Aramco listing. Y would they want oil to crash ?

5360 2018-02-01 13:55:38 You are guilty of being a idiot! Believe stuff that hasn’t happened yet? May or may not? Trump has never told truth once in his life!

5367 2018-02-01 13:54:45 Thanks, I hope so too. I must say the left has, on the whole, been very quiet about the downturn in the oil industry. More jobs have been lost in it than in the coal industry, and over a shorter timescale. It makes me suspect that there are few labour votes from offshore

We understood that even though there is no level playing field, it will eventually benefit indirectly. But then it should be sabka vikas.

5401 2018-02-01 13:51:13 Why are #gasprices high? Supply: Since OPEC enacted #oil production cuts to start '17, 650 million barrels of crude oil haven't been produced that otherwise may have. US oil exports also ~record levels. Demand: remains very strong in USA, China now importing nearly as much as US.

5483 2018-02-01 13:44:53 Thanks Jim. Alot of the oil in the northeast of Sask is oil shale, but very deep. More expensive than these options.
5484 2018-02-01 13:44:50 I'd go cruisin at night and it would take a dollar's worth of gas and a quart of oil.  Duct tape was my best friend.

5534 2018-02-01 13:39:25 ....easy they deduct up to 90% of investment costs from profits on existing oil and gas fields. I.e. it is the Norwegian tax payers that is actually paying for the risks that the oil and gas now bet on. Unfortunately, very few Norwegians understands this!

5590 2018-02-01 13:33:45 Link doesn’t work. And SLS are in lots of products, I avoid it now in most of mine I think. The one I don’t understand is liquid paraffin. I guess we just have to find products which fit with our values and work on our skin and mineral oil and paraffin aren’t ones I use
5591 2018-02-01 13:33:42 Perhaps I’m over simplifying but you still haven’t convinced me that some tax incentive for energy exploration (to ultimately help US move away from foreign oil dep) is undesirable.
5592 2018-02-01 13:33:39 This govt couldn't manage the fiscal deficit when crude oil was below $60/barrel. We can't expect it to manage the fisc when oil shoots up to $80 or $90 per barrel.

5596 2018-02-01 13:33:19 Independence would see Gdp @118% per capita making it the worlds 14th economy pushing rUk to 18th, look no further than Norway with its trillion pounds fund from oil! Scotland must be only oil rich area with foodbanks!! Tory Austerity think on it!

5598 2018-02-01 13:32:55 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 짤 너무 젖절ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
5599 2018-02-01 13:32:47 Economic numbers in US beginning to really slow.  High prices at pump vs previous years, higher interest rates, and peak valuations dont bode well for oil demand out forward.
5600 2018-02-01 13:32:32 Sometimes even more so... Waiting on that oil turn...
5601 2018-02-01 13:32:27 Maybe ingested isn't the proper word, rather absorbed, but the intention is for the oils to end up inside of one's body. Maybe some use oil diffusers because they smell good, but that's not the original, and commonly used purpose.
5602 2018-02-01 13:32:21 I look forward to investing in cleaner energy solutions, but my company is a small business taking one step at a time. We focus on environmental protection and oil clean up first because we’ll sadly, still be stuck on oil for at least another 20 years.
5603 2018-02-01 13:32:18 I baru nak cuba first time beli before this i pakai hada labo cleansing oil yg tu okayy tapi mahal sikit
5604 2018-02-01 13:32:16 I always hate getting my oil changed but the Jiffy Lube in Midtown is chill af. Never try to sell me extras and always give me coupons.

5606 2018-02-01 13:32:15 @RachelNotley warned BC that "there would be consequences" to resisting Alberta pipelines. 
Yes, Rachel. Like reducing the likelihood of oil spills and environmental damage.
What about the consequences of climate change?
How about we leave the oil in the ground and go renewable?
5607 2018-02-01 13:32:12 Hon. Cecilia Ogwal: There is a rumour that truck loads are leaving the oil fields at night but the Minister of @mofpedU is silent on this. What is happening? What is happening to the oil fund?
5608 2018-02-01 13:32:11 After the bread-fixing scandal, I'm hoping the Competition Bureau moves  onto cauliflower ,almonds, coconut oil, chicken...

5621 2018-02-01 13:30:10 We actually don't have the ability to live without oil ... yet! But good try. I mean the Amish life-style aside, unless you have a secret to share. Fly to your next gig without the help of oil. Kinda like protesters paddling in their plastic kayaks to protest oil rig. #Oyvey

5624 2018-02-01 13:29:54 1. Dependency on oil as % of gov revenue was reduced w/ the implementation of GST (Tax-based rev).
2. If 1986 & 1987 had 103% & 102% respectively, the gov should have collapsed w/ @raishussin 's logic.
3. Shrink the gov sector = Jobs will be lost.

5633 2018-02-01 13:28:52 Listen, @PhillyPolice, you guys did an amazing job with the crowds for the NFC title. Hear me out - GEAR OIL IS TOXIC. Please do not grease the poles with gear oil. You could poison your citizens, and all of that grease will rinse into the streets/water supply. Please don’t.

5640 2018-02-01 13:28:14 I work in the oil storage and containment industry. Pipelines are The safest way to transport oil while we still use it. The important thing to do is require quarterly testing and all means of cathodic protection necessary to prevent and detect wear, damage and leaks.

5649 2018-02-01 13:27:20 Lol, taking a knee is pretty peaceful. If you interpret it to protesting vets it's your own damn fault. What freedom by the way? Freedom to bombard other countries for oil?
5650 2018-02-01 13:27:17 That’s just stupid-you and the WH are oil sell outs-you lack vision and respect for ingenuity and the environment and what modern forward thinking Americans should be thinking-God, I can’t wait until you and your losers are thrown out on the streets & real visionaries take over
5651 2018-02-01 13:27:15 Barter sama purivera grapeseed+almond oil mau?
5652 2018-02-01 13:27:15 Why? the DPRK has no oil, no land anyone wants and it's unlikely the corporate-intelligence complex could profit from a radioactive wasteland; we should be safe enough. Now Iran, everyone wants a piece of Iran, just like in 1953, the last time you overthrew the government there..
5653 2018-02-01 13:27:08 Who told y’all to put coconut oil on your face lol it doesn’t even go there

5664 2018-02-01 13:25:44 US priorities are changing- It's about to overtake Russia and Saudi Arabia in terms of oil production. Israel takes care of its own security. US priorities are terrorism and national security- beyond that I believe it's back to the drawing board.
5665 2018-02-01 13:25:43 Tech is the new Oil

5678 2018-02-01 13:23:55 TEHRAN- Islamic Majlis members Manuchehr Jamali: It's not enough to announce embezzlement of billions in the Ministry of Oil and do nothing. Plundering the national treasury takes place on industrial scale and no one is ever punished.

5679 2018-02-01 13:23:54 I think be careful what you wish for. The clubs in a stable position, I'd prefer American earned dollars than oil slave money anyway, and you can't blame FSG for the managers decisions, did they buy Lovern or mignolet? No Rodgers did, they backed him. Has klopp spent? Yes!

5685 2018-02-01 13:23:20 So why is the price of oil raising so much?  Don’t see you tweeting about that. This will cause inflation. Who care is we produce more oil. If it doesn’t help keep fuel prices low it’s useless like you and your master.

5690 2018-02-01 13:23:03 Peak oil used to be about running out of supply; now some think that we will run out of demand. But not if the oil companies can help it. #Science #teamfollowback
5691 2018-02-01 13:23:01 oil was only ever a bonus it is not needed to survive,a would give it to them to get out, but they have had far more than their fair share already far more
5692 2018-02-01 13:22:58 Tea tree oil is so underrated
5693 2018-02-01 13:22:54 Tell me. Has climate change killed anyone? Also. Science hasn't even proved that if we don't use oil anymore the world will stop heating up.

5791 2018-02-01 13:11:38 If we’re producing oil at rates as high as 50 years ago...and can’t even get prices down to 20 years ago, does something seem off?
5792 2018-02-01 13:11:37 where do u think the electricity 2 power electric cars comes from? how much oil do u think is used2 manufacture them? to manufacture the infrastructure 2 use them? if u really believe that our reliance on oil has anything 2 do with a couple tax breaks, u have another thing coming
5793 2018-02-01 13:11:26 Oil up $2 from y'day on surplus... go figure. Again obviously something else going on here as technicals and data are not influencing price.

5891 2018-02-01 12:59:56 Picking your brains today. For nice natural looking sanded floors is varnish or hard wax oil best?
5892 2018-02-01 12:59:55 To be fair if you mean Scottish telly ? Then it really is of no consequence to us as all our oil and it's revenue flow south.
So if there's plenty or none whilst we are under westminsters boot we will never see the resulting wealth... that's reserved for London.
5893 2018-02-01 12:59:47 Is it organic or GMO genetically modified oil, how about erudic acid content?

5895 2018-02-01 12:59:19 Also no one know from where money will come for the massive agricultural expenditure and universal healthcare scheme. With GST collections going down every month + oil prices rising + fiscal target will be crossed, Modi is day dreaming

5897 2018-02-01 12:58:58 Fish oil is always tricky to put in human context from mouse studies because they usually match the intakes. Few humans ever eat nearly as much fish oil as they do other fats.
5898 2018-02-01 12:58:44 Thanks, but why no motor oil I’ve heard it’s the best choice

5900 2018-02-01 12:58:28 @GlobalCalgary Was looking for weather & sports this morning. Saw Global praise Trump for sending oil rigs to National Parks  & the Fraser institute for bad mouthing Trudeau for predicted deficits. How un Canadian as usual. Carry on...I switched the channel for real news.

5907 2018-02-01 12:57:41 Surprised they can pull the oil out of the ground at those prices
5908 2018-02-01 12:57:40 1) I haul oil so I can't bring it down. But I do know why it's higher. If you noticed the prices did drop from a few years ago and that's because OPEC and other big oil producers wanted the U.S. to suffer. So what did they do. They flooded the market with oil to hurt us.

6038 2018-02-01 12:39:40 And yet the energy from one hour’s worth of the sunlight that reaches earth could power it for 1 year. Being the world’s biggest oil producer’s nothing to be proud of— renewable energy can bring independence from imports, create jobs and clean up the environment.

6177 2018-02-01 12:16:32 And you tore up all environmental protections to do so.  You gave huge tax cuts to big oil and gas businesses to do so at the expense of the middle class.  There are no congratulations to go with what you have done.
6178 2018-02-01 12:16:13 When do fuel costs drop? When do the profits for big oil translate into savings for middle America, and can you sustain those savings if internal production is at its highest point in 50 years? I suspect, those profits line the pockets of billionaires like Trump.

6301 2018-02-01 11:57:57 Hi @WHO, where would a person find your latest recommendations on a) Palm Oil and b) its main constituent Palmitic Acid? Are you still "convinced" palmitic acid increases cardiovascular disease? #WHO
6302 2018-02-01 11:57:53 some people even failed to understand the importance to have some secondary characters & only want to focus on the main characters.

6306 2018-02-01 11:57:42 That’s great but when are we going to stop buying oil from them

6308 2018-02-01 11:57:22  Ah um hmmm, can't be, Jimmy Carter and all the "experts" said we'd be outa oil by about 1985 , or so?!?
6309 2018-02-01 11:57:08 True. But in the debate on opening up the North of Norway for oil extraction, for example, the local population has been very split, with lots of people opposing it. Fear for fisheries, tourism, etc. It would be surprising to me if the Alaskan dividend didn't have an impact.
6310 2018-02-01 11:56:58 I gave up margarine and stopped buying things with palm oil in about a year or so ago. Marge was tricky at first, but now I don't miss it at all.

6312 2018-02-01 11:56:33 Oil and water don't mix.
6313 2018-02-01 11:56:14 That’s really cool about the oil and whatnot. However, the criminal president is attempting a “Saturday night massacre” in order to obstruct justice regarding his ties to Russia meddling in our democracy.
6314 2018-02-01 11:56:01 I had trouble with my cartilage healing when I got it done. Tea tree oil and washing it out with normal antibacterial soap while I was in the shower worked wonders for me
6315 2018-02-01 11:55:58 You’re in Canada?  How about we talking about pretty boy Trudeau. He shills for saving the environment, yet has no problem contributing to the problem by selling oil from the Alberta tar sands.
6316 2018-02-01 11:55:51 Difficulty with that is Norway for example own much of Statoil Thatcher sold our oil to pivate companies.

6320 2018-02-01 11:55:30 Comrad Trump, maybe you should tell the whole nation what you are up to with your pal Putin?  Why is their oil going into the USA?  Why no sanctions?  Shame on you.

6363 2018-02-01 11:50:56 @AlexHolleyFOX29  STP, the racer's edge, is what Mike was thinking about as a thick oil. Also, Crisco is non toxic. Most industrial oils are toxic and warn against skin contact. Is it a good idea to put our citizens, drunk tho they may be, at risk?

6465 2018-02-01 11:32:34 Just before some people jump to conclusions about the impact on oil demand: most busses in the advanced economies have been running on CNG and biodiesel. So replacing them with electric has no impact on oil demand. #oil #OOTT

6467 2018-02-01 11:32:06 Agreed.  The title was misleading since it claimed Russia labeled oil sanctions as an act of war.  While they oppose the sanctions, NK was the one declaring them as such.  The larger focus should be on continuing developments in Russian/U.S. relations.

6505 2018-02-01 11:26:11 As with all oil and gas companies. What intrigues me is why are you targeting RBD, especially if you see a decent story here?
6506 2018-02-01 11:26:06 That is because without oil, North Korea's military capa will be severely dampened. This is necessary to ensure NK has no option but to take the bruises if and when US decides to go forward w blood nose strategy.

The purchace of one or two ships is not an investment.
Selling Oil field Licences is not investment
6558 2018-02-01 11:15:23 Agreed. I would add: watch for BP to tout their investments in renewables (but also oil & gas as we see here) and note the many analysts who predict oil demand to continue increasing well beyond our carbon budget.

6718 2018-02-01 10:47:54 There was an advert on @SAfmRadio that was warning that the next world war won't be over oil,but it will be over something that we take for granted "Fresh water".It keeps on replaying on my mind when I hear and or read about this Cape water crisis.
6719 2018-02-01 10:47:10 This is what happens when you put Oil Industry execs in charge of energy, and people who care more about profit than the environment in charge of the EPA.

6761 2018-02-01 10:38:05 The geopolitically smartest thing to do for any nation is to achieve independence from gas & oil by a massive upscaling of renewable / alternate energy, mostly through solar energy. That will bring true independence and freedom of nations.

6767 2018-02-01 10:37:04 Brent crude rises above $69 as robust OPEC compliance offset strong U.S. output

Oil prices inched above $69 to pare losses as OPEC's strong compliance with a supply reduction pact offset U.S. production that topped 10 m barrels per day for the 1st time in nearly half a century.

6778 2018-02-01 10:34:18 It's perhaps a little unkind for George Osborne's ES to pour oil on the flames of poor Theresa May's leadership skills.

6994 2018-02-01 09:53:26 Chinese salvage crews are still trying to remove 1,900 tonnes of bunker fuel, the heavy oil used in ship engines, from a sunken Iranian oil tanker, the Ministry of Transport said on Thursday, almost a month after it collided with a freight ship.
6995 2018-02-01 09:53:04 No you’re thinking of “soy” they have this massive thing about calling men “soy boys” because soy apparently turns men weak or has oestrogen (they can’t spell or say oestrogen). Meanwhile on his snake oil... most of his shit is made using soy.

7000 2018-02-01 09:52:21 Give it up. There is no way you’re going to get sensible, intelligent people to vote for independence based on promises of oil income.
It is running out btw. It’s a finite resource. There is no boom coming. And most importantly we need to be *reducing* reliance on fossil fuels.
7001 2018-02-01 09:52:12 Interesting that Shell CEO is sidestepping a direct question from @KellyGilblom on whether the company made a loss in #oil trading in Q4 or not (Note that "refining & trading" income plunged from $891m in Q3 to $96m in Q4).

When are we all going to admit how much baths blow?
7133 2018-02-01 09:23:25 Citizens, not partisans. In 1910, Teddy R. set aside millions of acres of land so hard working people had a place to find beauty and feel the power of nature. We have a presn who wants t allocate some of that land t drill for oil or nat gas. Something is wrong & we have t fix it

7286 2018-02-01 08:55:51 El C thank you for your response, I conclude from your answers that: 
1) There is in actual fact oil from BB 
2) The YA loan will not cripple #UKOG 
3) You think that the share price will be 1-2p at the end of February 
4) Testing is almost finished
I agree with 3 of the above
7287 2018-02-01 08:55:34 Of course, if oil prices shoot higher, front-end rates in the U.S. move up, but no need to pick the top. What's the terminal rate here, 2.75, at a stretch?

7445 2018-02-01 08:25:57 What about it? You can exchange gold backed Yuan for actual gold. The US dollar and the Euro are backed by thin air!  So oil producing countries can effectively get paid in gold, not in sanction & war loving US dollars! Wake up!

7557 2018-02-01 08:07:13 There was a report from Health and Environment Alliance. According to the report, Australia’s oil, gas and coal producers enjoyed around $A5.6 billion in subsidies in 2014. That would have an impact. I have not verified that figure and may include petrol subsidies
7558 2018-02-01 08:06:58 when I prepoo I think I usually end up using some cheap conditioner and lately I've added a little olive oil and grape seed oil! I use an already mixed hair mask for my deep conditioning

7591 2018-02-01 08:00:29 Probably true. Obama was a true snake oil salesman, and had lots of personal charisma, while Trump is a crass, off-putting jerk. Still, you can’t compare them. Different media predominate today; mainly cable-cutters and online viewers who didn’t exist in 2010

7595 2018-02-01 07:58:49 The alternative conspiracy theory that fits the facts is that Scots in the oil firms have been slowing down the pace of the industry for decades, trying to minimise the amount their bosses produce before independence actually happens.

7671 2018-02-01 07:43:37 Have always maintained that this government wasted a historic opportunity - India’s first majority government in 30 years that had tail winds of low oil prices. Demonetisation was unnecessary. Government now forced to play catch up #Budget2018
7672 2018-02-01 07:43:17 The market is a Buy. Too much global tailwind for Emerging Markets for India to buck. That said, I doubt the Fiscal target will be met. And macro outlook is worrying, given my view on Oil which looks an absolute rocket.
7673 2018-02-01 07:43:14 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
7674 2018-02-01 07:42:41 Again so what ? How much oil does Ireland have ? Denmark ? Finland ? New Zealand ?  Austria ? Without oil we have a larger economy than most of them. So again what about oil ?

7688 2018-02-01 07:40:04 So Nigeria has now degenerated to such pitiable level as to import crude oil???
7689 2018-02-01 07:39:45 The people of BC do not want the oil pipeline. They never did. We dont want to have oil leaking out of pipes into our oceans. If you want the pipeline so bad build it down the middle of Alta and into the States.
7690 2018-02-01 07:39:35 Redistributing of the country’s oil wealth through its social programs and giving the poor a voice in Venezuelan politics is inspiration even with 2500% inflation under a heavily economic sanctions.
7691 2018-02-01 07:39:35 I guess it's just easier this way... it's the squeaky wheel which gets the oil... people are too complacent to complain, so we take the route of least resistance.
7692 2018-02-01 07:39:26 It looks like a normal 500ml bottle tbh just coat your hair in a thick greasy layer of cheap coconut and apricot oil and hope for the best
7693 2018-02-01 07:39:15 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
7694 2018-02-01 07:39:10 I put too much oil in the broccoli and they're punishing me by making me eat it

7696 2018-02-01 07:39:06 Because they put Crisco oil on it. Made it a challenge lol
7697 2018-02-01 07:38:46 A quality CBD oil can work wonders
7698 2018-02-01 07:38:40 COCONUT OIL IS TRASH
7699 2018-02-01 07:38:12 Why don't these guys build new refineries and build more of it to cater for the refining of crude oil which will also create jobs at the same time rather than put us all in pain for obvious reason,embezzlement.
7700 2018-02-01 07:38:09 @Shell those profits you reported to have made in 2017, are you going to distribute the profit to people of the earth? Of whom the oil actually belongs too.
7701 2018-02-01 07:38:03 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
7702 2018-02-01 07:37:53 Of course they know it doesn't create jobs and growth. They're a bunch of forked-tongued snake oil salesmen (and women). They're pandering to big end of town
7703 2018-02-01 07:37:47 Everyone forgot the petrol/diesel price crash around the end of 2016-early 2017? It was going to last “years” at around 30p/litre less... until the oil companies cried “redundancies...” then the price crept back up... secret deal? Investment? More jobs? Bonus’s?

7714 2018-02-01 07:34:49 Today I learned that cauliflower leaves are really yummy when roasted in the oven with olive oil, salt, dill and garlic powder. #ThanksInternet
7715 2018-02-01 07:34:40 Realist shit i ever read : “people pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter , eggs , oil , icing , a pan , an oven , then they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink sometimes you have everything right in front of you but how bad do you want it ?
7716 2018-02-01 07:34:34 Would still have magnetic field. Just reversed polarity.
7717 2018-02-01 07:34:31 He created this mess with doublespeak- at Paris climate accord & approving very dangerous KM pipeline to carry bitumen/ benzene thru urban areas to pristine coast where old tech barges take oil to China. You can’t clean this stuff up when inevitable spill happens
7718 2018-02-01 07:34:30 And I sell designer perfume oils which last longer Dan d original perfumes.and price is 4K for any perfumes u will like to have d oil. Slide in my dp pls
7719 2018-02-01 07:34:13 @realDonaldTrump keep your new American moment snake oil salesman
7720 2018-02-01 07:33:35 the budget did not bring up anything about Oil or global interest rates...so what happens if Oil or global interest rates go against India? I wonder. I think the Fish is under huge risk
7721 2018-02-01 07:33:34 Until KM and their buddies test dilbut with variables similar to BC waters, I assume it will be worse than Kalamazoo. 2 Escort Vessels(EV) tethered to tanker have oil recovery equipment like booms and etc. ERTV offshore version of EV but 24/7 stationed. WA and AK 1 each
7722 2018-02-01 07:33:27 Corn. 1 part oil,  1 part salt and 4 parts butter. Ingest.

7725 2018-02-01 07:32:27 Immediate takeaway from @Shell earnings. The company is as profitable with oil at $65 a barrel as it was with oil at $100 a barrel.
7726 2018-02-01 07:31:19 Bloody hell. Sky has shit itself right when the bit about which is the best cooking oil etc is on  The one thing I wanted to blimmin watch too grrrrr
7727 2018-02-01 07:31:19 Dietician on telly recommending horrible canola oil for cooking. No thanks.
7728 2018-02-01 07:30:51 Oil or talcum?
7729 2018-02-01 07:30:42 Mmmmm no other oil producing country has suffered like that not even Iran in which US sanctions are quite intense. Venezuela should be as rich a Saudi Arabia
7730 2018-02-01 07:30:34 OIL DIFF: 4.48 -> 4.53
7731 2018-02-01 07:30:26 Well... there’s a road Barnaby  most wants to fund - the outback highway to help his mates the big oil and cattle exporters get their trucks to the ports. That’s gotta be paid for. No matter what
7732 2018-02-01 07:30:06 I know this is wrong but I don't trust ladies petrol attendants to check my engine oil and water.....
7733 2018-02-01 07:29:53 選択肢試してみたら本当にバッドエンドがｗ　キアラもバッドあるんですなぁｗ
7734 2018-02-01 07:29:45 That it was for oil is a conspiracy theory.
7735 2018-02-01 07:29:38 Really, you should check out Gooey Rabinsky book, and some of these other great, informative Tweeters who research the studies and bring the truth to light. I'm living proof. The MMJ works, so does CBD oil. I think MMJ works better over all, but CBD is a great restorative.
7736 2018-02-01 07:29:24 higher oil price has helped Shell. The company has announced profits more than doubled in the fourth quarter of 2017, to around £3 billion. #bbcgms 0740
7737 2018-02-01 07:29:16 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. Joel 2:24 #Amen
7738 2018-02-01 07:29:05 555
7739 2018-02-01 07:28:54 Even if we have all Saints in the Coalition Movements but with Obasanjo as the Chief Engineer, it already nullifies all claim to righteousness and redeeming Nigeria. One finger soiled with oil soils the rest. Just any party but never with OBJ.
7740 2018-02-01 07:27:41 Squeaky wheel gets the oil

7747 2018-02-01 07:25:59 Does all cbd oil smell like fish oil? Bc I’ll find a different remedy for pain if so....
7748 2018-02-01 07:25:57 Oil for the nerves. Nerves are like rusty-line, causes pain. CBD oil is like WD-40, for nerves & brain. Especially the spacing in the gyres and sulces of the brain. Synapse can't bridge the gap, then less activity in brain like memory and motor function. CBD Oil bridge the gap.

7750 2018-02-01 07:25:32 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
7751 2018-02-01 07:25:16 It's not a surprise when you know you're becoming again the world's leading producer of oil!

7754 2018-02-01 07:23:59 sound like Big Oil slipped them a little extra dough for this one...
7755 2018-02-01 07:23:48 Petrodollar puppets pandering to polluting profit addicts giving nothing back except pollution. Why let non American oil companies near our old technology oil reserves to steal for profit? Lowering taxes on all multinational corporations is theft of our paychecks & resources.
7756 2018-02-01 07:23:47 Yes, it's a grim picture.  I've always believed that the gold standards should have been maintained.  The one hope here in Libya is that oil production will balance out this large influx of cash.  Uncertain days and, like I said, it's a desperate gamble.
7757 2018-02-01 07:23:33 Facts only .. @EAukot see, follow this or else you will go down to the extend of discovering oil. @Thirdwaykenya is known only via TV..  Take For instance  how KFCB boss @EzekielMutua trends all counties for his initiative..

7761 2018-02-01 07:22:48 A scarecrow in the oil plantation
7762 2018-02-01 07:22:48 It's potent and the pills don't have much of a lingering taste like I've found the oil has. The spray is intense but it's really good.
7763 2018-02-01 07:22:30 Honestly, there’s not much people can do to stop it. The Earth heats and cools naturally, and humans have been accelerating it for a while. Increasing oil production is not gonna hurt it severely. I wish we could stop accelerating it, but at this point it’s nearly impossible
7764 2018-02-01 07:22:17 Omg! That look delicious! Someone pass me my olive oil and herbs!!! 
7765 2018-02-01 07:22:13 Its not like you are an oil painting mate ffs

7770 2018-02-01 07:21:15 Preggie pops! Also lemon essential oil, a little drop on ur wrist.
7771 2018-02-01 07:21:06 Glencore reports higher Q4 copper production, but lower on a FY basis; zinc and ferrochrome in-line, nickel and coal down, oil interests down
7772 2018-02-01 07:20:44 This argument does not hold water. In today's times, oil producing nations are competing to supply to India. Whether it's Saudi, Iran, Iraq or USA. India buys oil from each and today's India bargains hard...
So OPEC is not obliging India in any way

Amazing talga CL Kasoy Oil
7774 2018-02-01 07:20:33 I was in awe as I read through this ""white paper"", they cite the benefits of open blockchains while proposing a completely centralised system that requires full faith and credit for the fairy tale of oil reserves. Who in their right mind would acquire Petros???
7775 2018-02-01 07:20:25 Watched @CW_Riverdale tonight and #VeronicaLodge was getting confirmed #ReligiousRite - as a #Catholic I wish these shows would actually do their research: annoiting it’s w/oil, and the priest shakes hand says “peace be w/u” confirmed reply “& w/ur spirit” Holy Communion is after

7794 2018-02-01 07:17:24 I’m going to bed. Some girl on snap chat said she spends 20 minutes on her teeth a day... and she uses coconut oil on her teeth. One for I know your gums are bleeding

7823 2018-02-01 07:12:01 It is painfully apparent that Schiff has no problem telling lies and misleading the public with the guile, slickness and audacity of a snake oil salesman.  That's his job.  The question is how much harm is he inflicting on biased and ignorant people who want to believe his spiel?

7840 2018-02-01 07:10:13 France is banning oil drilling on their land and territories. The Netherlands is moving away from natural gas for houses and petrol for cars as quickly as they can, and Trump is pushing coal. It’s just so embarrassing. And wrong. And stupid.
7841 2018-02-01 07:10:02 No I’d say 4-2 but completely undeserving so 2-0 is fine. Everyone has an off game and I’m glad ours was against a self made team like spurs. Dont even mind losing to Liverpool or arsenal. Better a club built on its own lack of ambition as compared to 1 built on oil money

7850 2018-02-01 07:08:20 No he wasn’t. He only went to United because they outbidded Arsenal&his manager. After this engine oil shoot, he realised he had made a career mistake and desperately set out to correct that by finding his way back to his beloved Arsenal.

7861 2018-02-01 07:06:16 Kind of right......his infrastructure was stimulus....”shovel ready jobs”.  Oil gets taxed for highway repairs, where the hell does that money go? I like Trump but the last thing this country needs is more debt.  My great grandkids are already $40000 in the whole.

7871 2018-02-01 07:04:54 Metal prices have firmed in overnight trade, which together with a weaker rand against the US dollar should support the prices of mining shares today. Furthermore we expect that a stronger crude oil price should support the prices of energy shares today.

7957 2018-02-01 06:50:04 Oh Venezuela... Can't make up my mind on Petro. It's a scam, it'll be nothing, or it's legit and brings money into the country? Isn't it backed by barrels of oil still in the ground that are also used as collateral for loans from other countries?  #Petro #Cryptocurrency
7958 2018-02-01 06:50:02 Today’s people have been led to believe that burning oil to obtain any type of energy is normal and inoffensive, while in fact it poisons the planet. Humanity needs to wake up and stop burning oil. Half-baked coverup solutions are just a distraction from the hard reality.
7959 2018-02-01 06:49:58 Apparently it's good for piercings but when I used it I just smelled cat piss. Not the fresh oil but like the after-smell if that makes sense?
7960 2018-02-01 06:49:46 @arunjaitley #AskYourFM As a common man I can't tolerate daily hike of petrol and diesel price. Do you think its acceptable? I could not accept its because of the Crude Oil price. The price of the crude oil in 2014 is 96.29/barrel and in 2017 end it is 52.51/barrel.

7972 2018-02-01 06:47:48 BTW, only folk in BC that would be immune from TMP's inability to carry refined products would be from Prince George northward (NW & NE BC). Why? Husky oil refinery in PG, which distributes refined products in that geographic area.

7987 2018-02-01 06:45:32 Baby oil is the mother of all adhesive remover. It'll get that right off. Additionally if you don't want it to pick up bits of fluff and crap, use a bit of medical tape on the edges! Keeps everything neat and clean :3

8043 2018-02-01 06:33:36 Kurds have nothing to offer: no oil, no geostrategic position, no votes. Early Turkish Republic called them "mountain Turks". Later "divide and rule" (lots of regime supporters in Turkey: HudaPar - ex Hezbollah). PKK wanted peace, AKP sabotaged after losing June 2015 elections
8044 2018-02-01 06:33:23 How will they manage this with oil prices rising? Kya pakodanomics hai yeh?
8045 2018-02-01 06:32:50 You ever make any "fat bomb" snacks with coconut oil or peanut butter. They're pretty good and filling. :)
8046 2018-02-01 06:32:15 Now you know part of the reason why Oil prices were kept high..the social sector bonanza in this budget is being funded by the corpus built on high oil prices..might go to drain if middle class doesn't get their due..

8051 2018-02-01 06:31:23 The vast Saudi desert comes to mind. This enormous area could eventually be terraformed into forests and lakes paid for by that kingdom who's enormous fortune was created wholly by the production of oil. Entire wilderness could be created with water from the Gulf and the sunshine
8052 2018-02-01 06:31:23 BTW, the current TMP is typically over-subscribed by 60% - 70% monthly. With declining Alaskan oil output, WA State & Californian coastal refineries looking for new sources. As they have cokers installed, AB heavy oil/bitumen their best bet due to logistics. All TMP to WA State.

8092 2018-02-01 06:22:38 First Gen submitted an unsolicited proposal for Philippine National Oil to join company in building onshore LNG storage and regasification terminal which will be constructed in its energy complex in Batangas
8093 2018-02-01 06:22:10 And purify your home and put salt on your door step. I put in my windows and outside my door way. I also cleanse it with WHITE SAGE OiL and rub it in the wood on each door way in my home and the enterance to my home. And i would out that doll in a glass box.

8100 2018-02-01 06:20:41 4.  The cheapest new energy in the world isn't fossil fuels, it's solar and wind. And the tar sands, being among the most expensive forms of oil, will die first.  So, best case is you are putting the BC coast at risk for decades to prop up a dying industry for a few extra years.
8101 2018-02-01 06:20:18 It doesn't work like magic. The strength of the Naira is dependent upon several factors and not the price of oil or the foreign reserves. The most important factor is that you should either export more than you import or at the least equal your import to the export.
8102 2018-02-01 06:20:14 TRUMP: "We have ended the war on American energy." THE FACTS: Energy production increased in past administrations, particularly Barack Obama’s. With hydraulic fracturing & using oil reserves the US for the 1st time in decades was getting more energy domestically than it imports.

8108 2018-02-01 06:19:02 even that is out of date now but reflects whose production affects the prices. Massive rise in US shale oil production prompted a Saudi (& others) race to the bottom on prices by raising production to break US shale but didn't work.

8122 2018-02-01 06:16:13 Since we're already sending oil across your  park you should stop that and bring more in by tanker. Oops, it always ends at more tankers.

8133 2018-02-01 06:14:06 What am I missing in my take on IR move. & speed (opposite to yours)? LT oil priced is capped at marginal US shale prod., thus no "oil price" inflation, home vals falling, thus pending neg wealth effect to hit consum. spend, macro prod. killing credit growth, UE rate >5%, Inf <2%

Also wash your face with a type of brush (not saying it has to be expensive) but getting the old skin off is the most important. Also a nice oil after washing your face helps soften and lighten.

8144 2018-02-01 06:11:36 In AB anything to get big oil to be responsible is undermining the env pillar. The PCs put in REDA; AER does not work in the public int and can't be sued.

8225 2018-02-01 05:56:10 This really isn't complicated.  You have a Saudi/US/Israel axis and a Russia/Iran axis.  Both would like to supply Europe with gas and perhaps oil liquids too.

By not passing the benefit of lower oil prices,  govt looted more than 6 lakh cr of people money. Complete failure?

8272 2018-02-01 05:46:37 Good for you! Ignore morals and facts. Let the fact that Dear Leader Donald was able to trick you with his slimy snake oil salesman schtick convince you that an America where the presidency exists to hurt gays and minorities is something inspiring.

8277 2018-02-01 05:46:18 Not dumb, bc I asked the lady who helped me the same question but she said that you can dry your skin out by using too many detox masks/cleansers, masks too often, and harsh products w lots of chemicals. So your skin will over produce oils to compensate for all the oil lost-
8278 2018-02-01 05:46:13 Some workplaces (oil rigs) now insist on liver function tests to find the heavy drinkers. Serves all those boozers who cheered on drug testing to "get those druggies" right. You can sleep off a nights drinking. You can't sleep off a lifetime of heavy drinking

8295 2018-02-01 05:43:17 Divisive. That's a good word we might pin on an old oil man we elected into office. Use to do oil business with Osama bin laden back in the day. So rather than call him on his fairy tale, weapons of mass destruction, we'll say he was just being DIVISIVE. LMFAO.

8338 2018-02-01 05:35:25 Depends on EROEI of the consumed oil. Also lower supply would increase prices and encourage switch to another fuel source. Renewables are now competitive in many instances.

8365 2018-02-01 05:29:51 Yes! That’s the only downside I’ve heard about it. I read how storing it upside down would keep the moisture levels even and it wouldn’t dry so quickly, I’m gonna try it! If all else fails I’ll try Inglot Duraline drops or some kind of oil to restore it.
8366 2018-02-01 05:29:47 I made it to the part of the article where it talks about how mad Peterson is at the idea that you can't be violent with "crazy women" Snake oil salesman or not, he's a giant piece of shit, poor excuse for a human being.

8373 2018-02-01 05:28:27 Because the oil industry has a vested interest in undermining public trust in climate science. And sadly, judging by the other comments, it’s worked far too well...
8374 2018-02-01 05:28:24 I have not! Just got started. Those all sound like wonderful suggestions. I also have almond oil on the list to try.

8385 2018-02-01 05:26:28 Oil was just an example, for a more general term, resources. As I've said, America does it because it has more benefit than lose. If you believe the army deploys troops solely to help, then you're living in wonderland.
8386 2018-02-01 05:26:10 It’s because it’s dry out, pours shrink and are not active in producing oil and other secretions.

8388 2018-02-01 05:26:02 LRT also reflected in which industries the two parties choose to show support for. Dems for renewable energy (but still privately owned), GOP for oil and gas. Dems for web tech companies that get rich subtlety by stealing information, GOP for ISPs and surveillance firms; etc.
8389 2018-02-01 05:25:42 @sambitswaraj we need better roads than low oil prices
8390 2018-02-01 05:25:40 Oil and gas may save the U.S. economy from the coming federal deficit crisis.  One can hope.
8391 2018-02-01 05:25:32 He also did not finish that story: After 1 year, Oil pice crashed and the buyers of Chevron Netherlands file for bankruptcy. So all his going to pray in church payed off. God saved him from the consequences of that business.
8392 2018-02-01 05:25:28 So in an attempt to make tostones a drop of scorching hot oil landed on my foot. I can barely walk because of how bad my foot hurts. Please send help.
8393 2018-02-01 05:25:23 Additives to medications geared toward people who begin to discover the truth about the world, incapacitates people. It's akin to the amount of plastic in the ocean, our bodies our oceans, it does accumulate.  Plastics will destroy us, unless we burn it back to oil, then mycelium
8394 2018-02-01 05:25:16 the stock market rally though not a reflection of the on ground situation is a parameter govt can laud abt in their regime. thy won't want to tinker with it esp in electionb yr and while battling the risk of higher oil prices. neither wld they want to isolate the hni community.

8400 2018-02-01 05:24:24 I see these all the time. I look up quite a bit.
I thought they were oil spills from the sky tankers that we call commercial jets. 
Like how the gutter is pretty because of the oil rainbow.
8401 2018-02-01 05:24:14 Salads are sandwiches in a bowl... lettuce, tomato, onion, dressing (oil, vinegar, etc.), croutons (bread), chicken/turkey.

So why aren’t there pickles in salad?

Don’t tell me there aren’t pickles in sandwiches. There are (Jersey Mike’s, Subway).

Hmm.

8407 2018-02-01 05:23:20 Your MCM doesn’t know how to do an oil change, check his tire pressure, or check the oil level in his car
8408 2018-02-01 05:22:52 True. So the only way to make the pores look smaller, is to make sure dlm pores tu bersih. No oil. Double cleansing dgn oil cleanser + foam cleanser. (Study from Liah Yoo juga ni hahaha)

8412 2018-02-01 05:22:04 There is a plethora of evidence as well as anecdotes about cannibidiol oil (extracted from cannabis plant) treating anxiety, PTSD, and epilepsy effectively - with less side-effects, no risk for abuse (confirmed by WHO), and no "high". Should be legal everywhere. #BellLetsTalk
8413 2018-02-01 05:21:57 You do realize that oil and natural gas are so deeply intertwined that you can’t really split these fairly.   IMO you can’t say oil lost jobs while nat gas gained jobs.  
You want to compare coal and solar thats a valid discussion.
8414 2018-02-01 05:21:44 It currently takes ~3.75 Gas BOEs to equal the revenue of one Oil BOE

8432 2018-02-01 05:18:42 Put several drops of tea tree oil in a handful of shampoo every time you wash your hair (and all your family members).  After the coast is clear you can still do it every so often as a preventative. #NoLice
8433 2018-02-01 05:18:24 Discussion was very interesting. Sir i agree with your point on import of crude oil but sir government need to incentives electric vehicles and use of solar energy as it facing challenges.
8434 2018-02-01 05:17:57 EVOO 270F
Coconut Oil 330F
Refined Grapeseed Oil 480F
Extra Virgin Avocado Oil (EVAO) 482F

When cooking temperatures pass the smoke point of the oil, the oil starts to burn, forming carcinogens and toxic compounds.

EVAO highest smoke point & no chemicals or solvents in EVAO!

8438 2018-02-01 05:17:31 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

8460 2018-02-01 05:14:05 Refined Grapeseed Oil Smoke Point 480F 

Temps above 480F burn Grapeseed Oil, forming carcinogens and toxic chemical compounds.

Extra Virgin Avocado Oil 482F (one of the highest smoke points of any oil) recommended for high heat cooking, but also delicate enough for salads.
8461 2018-02-01 05:13:55 So oil is ok as long as it's from somewhere else and it keeps coming. Nice to know.
8462 2018-02-01 05:13:52 God bless my boyfriend for taking my car to get an oil change bc he knows I get hella anxiety when it comes to talking with strangers and dealing with my car that I know absolutely nothing about
8463 2018-02-01 05:13:44 Can I be the baby’s godfather? I won’t kiss her, but I can use an olive oil company as a front to move cash around buy stuff for her. (That’s a pull that I’ll be legitimately impressed if anyone gets)
8464 2018-02-01 05:13:37 Remember when you were a kid and could swim at a beach anywhere in the lower mainland? Well I guess you still can but after isn't so great. Send you oil east. Easy, just a bit more pipe, think of those jobs!
8465 2018-02-01 05:13:35 Alternative sources of energy may work better in some areas than others due to geography. 

But the variability of green energy forces gov't to keep other power plants (coal, oil, nuclear, etc.) running to cover for when wind & solar aren't working due to enviromental factors.

8479 2018-02-01 05:10:47 The tourists like crab and lobster and beaches. Tourism=jobs. Offshore drilling will kill the lobsters and crabs and ruin the beaches.

8482 2018-02-01 05:10:02 Depends on the smoke point (temp oils starts to burn, forming carcinogens and harmful chemical compounds).

Smoke points:
EVOO 270F
Refined Coconut Oil 350F
Extra Virgin Avocado Oil 482F
(Oils pressed from fruit, not considered veg oil)

Refined Corn Oil (Veg Oil) 450F
8483 2018-02-01 05:10:01 we shouldn't have to test it. We should be told what the purpose is and what the rules are. Take the snake oil out of the game and tell us what is going on

8495 2018-02-01 05:08:27 You would think that the lib leadership would at least support the one province that has implemented the carbon tax by making Canadians support us.but noooo force us to support carbon tax then allow Canadian provinces to purchase oil from countries that don't. Hypocrites they are
8496 2018-02-01 05:08:07 So my eyelids have been dry as f and I was trying everything (I hate going to the doctor so I'll only go if I can't get it under control) and guess what has been working? FCKN COCONUT OIL, finally they're healing. Can't wait to wear makeup again lol

8505 2018-02-01 05:06:30 Got the deep fryer back up and running. You can say an Air Fryer is healthier, but I prefer the old fashioned way why? Because 1. Nostalgia and 2. I like the taste better, oil gives it such good flavor!
8506 2018-02-01 05:06:23 You know he thinks you’re beautiful when he posts the worst (the end of the day when you’re makeup shows it’s been on a while and that oil peaks through) pictures and thinks it’s a good picture cause he clearly posted it online for people to see, that’s when you know he’s the 1.
8507 2018-02-01 05:06:16 My two fav products are the White Peony leave-in and the Protein-Free deep conditioner. I really like the Babassu Oil Mint deep conditioner but my hair is protein sensitive so I’m in  w/the PF one! I also have the mint almond oil.
8508 2018-02-01 05:06:09 I COULd fall in love... or I could cover myself entirely in peppermint oil until I’m completely NUMB ?? And Guess which one I choose IDIOT

8511 2018-02-01 05:05:30 Cus the only thing worse than killing on average 20 civilians for every suspected terrorist in drone strikes is complaining about it!                        also would you please stop spending trillions of our dollars pissing off citizens of oil rich countries to “keep us safe”.

8515 2018-02-01 05:05:11 @Parliament_UG "the omission of oil fund transactions was an oversight" who doesn't know you are drilling oil? For heavensake your policy speaks otherwise!
8516 2018-02-01 05:04:46 I almost accidentally took a swig of olive oil
8517 2018-02-01 05:04:46 Partly a short covering rally, partly investors buying the dip in oil. Feb seasonally slow, could see a pullback to 63, maybe deeper depending on inventory reports. Still the trend has been long since 42 and nothing has changed. It's BTD because oil is going higher. #OOTT

8519 2018-02-01 05:04:15 snake oil refers to something with mysterious qualities that are not measurable. Like when people would travel from town to town and sell 'snake oil remedies'

8522 2018-02-01 05:03:45 I'm not super smart about this, but iirc, for bleached hair you, you need something for moisture (like coconut oil) and something with protein for strength.
8523 2018-02-01 05:03:23 Home from #BostonCounts and more grateful than ever for a roof over my head and a full tank of heating oil. Met one man in Southie who asked for extra gloves for his homeless friends. Promised he would go to shelter when the van showed up.

The Driving licence of Oil and Water Tankers heavy vehicles should be taken by Road traffic officers (RTO)

8568 2018-02-01 04:57:37 It is immoral for the evil oil companies to inflict New Yorkers with their vile product.

8582 2018-02-01 04:55:32 Why then, haven't gas prices started to drop? We have so much oil in reserve, that it could compete with OPEC. They have been capping oil wells for longer than 50 years. Time to loosen it up a little.

8653 2018-02-01 04:43:05 As gas prices go up, the democrats will soon be blaming @realDonaldTrump for manipulating the price of oil. #MAGA
8654 2018-02-01 04:42:48 My goodness. Are you two still arguing? Angie does not want people in Vancouver to have access to Alberta Oil used to create gasoline and jet fuel. She loves her public transit, which runs on ... gasoline created from Alberta Oil. She wants to bring in Oil by tanker.

8663 2018-02-01 04:40:57 Yes. My mother said using it in my head around that time. She’ll be alright. And castor oil is good for hair grow as well.

8677 2018-02-01 04:39:35 No one is suggesting anything other than we might be better off if it was actually possible for oil from one part of the country to be sold in the rest of it. 
You know, kind of like how cars made in Ontario get sold all across Canada. 
But a lack of pipelines prevents that...

8688 2018-02-01 04:37:44 putting castor oil on my eyelashes every night has proven to be the biggest mess
8689 2018-02-01 04:37:41 They pull a fair amount of the oil off the product.  I've been told oil content has to do with what the price of the oil is.
8690 2018-02-01 04:37:39 yes? Hello, I like to cook lol. Like the other night I made some chicken. In the pan I had some oil, diced up some garlic and rosemary, heated that in the oil and then put the chicken in with some basil, thyme and oregano.

8696 2018-02-01 04:36:59 I've always believed this 2! US govt. needed an excuse 2 invade Iraq 4 oil & so, when they heard of plot, they let it happen. Too many things did not add up that day.  We paid a terrible price, Iraq even more, & the truth will come out one day.
8697 2018-02-01 04:36:56 Meanwhile, the oil magnate negotiates without a clue to strategy.   Hell.  We'd be better off with some comics & actors "playing" diplomats.

8700 2018-02-01 04:36:30 I think a great question is where did they get the $$ to buy the weapons. Nobody supplies anything for free. It took trump & his generals to destroy their oil supplies which allowed them make billions
8701 2018-02-01 04:36:27 Brilliant, people with little to none knowledge of how oil is priced blames the government for everything. Suggestion : USE GOOGLE.

 Oil rose for the first time this week as a surprise decline in U.S. gasoline supplies helped ease concerns about lackluster demand.

8710 2018-02-01 04:33:28 hahaha, it's what fish eat to produce Omega-3s in their fish oil. basically, an eco-friendly solution instead of buying fish oil (which has lots of negative reviews, outside of all the vegan stuff)

8714 2018-02-01 04:32:20 Yea, because once enviro's are done with the pipeline they aren't going to eat your lunch about rail either. Come on. Enviro's can't wait to win on pipelines so we can stop oil by rail.

8721 2018-02-01 04:31:08 As for your example you have it half ass backwards. What you should have said if the price of oil goes up due to a short term event ie political turmoil and the price of oil goes up the companies are not going to start producing MORE based on this one factor.
8722 2018-02-01 04:31:07 Those oil companies really care about the workers!

8744 2018-02-01 04:28:14 Yeah. Breadcrumbs, egg, parmesan, thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, touch of parsley, bit of milk & oil. New recipe, looked good. Smells great.
8745 2018-02-01 04:28:06 You’re helping her make her point. If they weren’t keeping us dependent on oil the alternative means would not be so expensive.

8754 2018-02-01 04:27:17 I disagree. You cannot replace the BTU's that fossil fuels produce that easily. You have not done the math. There plenty of jobs being provided by our increased oil and natural gas production. I am against what you espouse, and it will only cause energy prices to rise.
8755 2018-02-01 04:27:13 I think oil goes lower, except in the back of my mind, it's getting colder. More cold, more oil, more coal...
8756 2018-02-01 04:26:48 Feeling very tired and travelling means being surrounded by coughing people. Must take cod liver oil when I get home.

8758 2018-02-01 04:26:19 You know 4 times more oil is exported right?
And you know Canada as a country doesn't import anything right? It's a freely traded commodity. 

Send your complaints to free enterprise. 

You get the red star for suggesting nationalizing our oil.

8805 2018-02-01 04:21:33 Hi and thanks for the kind words.  Do you know anyone that can benefit?  I am happy to have a conversation with people in need of healing.  Do you have any questions about this CBD Oil I can answer for you?
8806 2018-02-01 04:21:24 WARMING UP OLIVE OIL HELPS ALONG WITH THAT
8807 2018-02-01 04:21:11 This is one of the most overt actions to take down the renewable energy business in favor of saving the last of the fossil fuel energy industry. There are still billions of dollars to be made until every last drop of oil & every last piece of coal are used to generate energy!
8808 2018-02-01 04:20:58 Snake oil saleswoman!! Brilliant, but oh so evil.
8809 2018-02-01 04:20:58 Apparently Chicken Oil's are good. Idk I just work there
8810 2018-02-01 04:20:47 Yeah but lots and lots and lots of corruption.  Oil is probably the only thing keeping that country afloat.
8811 2018-02-01 04:20:27 just found out some essential oils are toxic to animals, i’m gonna stop he use of my “better sleep” oil until i get the full list of what’s in it, till then, WE ARE ALL KOALAS AND EUCALYPTUS IS WHERE ITS AT
8812 2018-02-01 04:20:22 We should have solar panels on every roof, but the Gop, beautiful coal and oil has kept them unaffordable.
8813 2018-02-01 04:20:20 It’s also helpful if you dilute the oil . Usually 1 drop of oil to 5 drops of coconut oil. My household has 6 cats, 2 dogs, and a bunny. We consistently diffuse oils. Tea tree is definitely a no no but the other oils mentioned are fine.
8814 2018-02-01 04:20:10 Just a reminder.
Fuel prices lowered with Obama.
Going up with Trump.
Let oil kings praise him!
8815 2018-02-01 04:20:09 Tough game for the Ice, who fall 5-2 to the Oil Kings. Ice lead shot clock 32-25. Brett Davis tallies two goals  & is now up to 18 for the season.

What is this sorcery? 
8833 2018-02-01 04:17:28 Respectfully, Suzette, that is Balderdash! Oligarchs essentially control an industry, like John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil, which is what anti-trust laws were created to combat. Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Jack Dorsey.

8835 2018-02-01 04:16:54 Don't speak on subject you know nothing about. American oil wells have increased as have shale drilling since crude hit $60 per barrel. Natural Gas has been exported since last year
8836 2018-02-01 04:16:50 Also, the "essential" in essential pils does not mean the same thing it does in essential amino acid.

Essential amino acid = your body needs it and cannot synthesize it

Essential oil = oil extracted from whatever thing

8838 2018-02-01 04:16:23 I'm not disagreeing with what you said, except kim & Trump are not friendly. Trump is escalating the N. Korea thing to distract. Putin wants to give N. Korea oil and also enhanced N.Korea's missile system to go longer to hit the U,S. 
N. Korea's criticism of Trump is all true.

8845 2018-02-01 04:15:12 Andrew Carnegie was fond of the Gospel of Wealth: the principle of giving back one's riches to the community. Likewise, he disliked Rockefeller's practices of monopolizing the oil industry to benefit only himself.

8848 2018-02-01 04:14:55 Why does this remind me of Saddam Hussein and the "oil for aid bonds"  that will of course end badly but for different reasons?
8849 2018-02-01 04:14:49 Thank you! I've been asking a lot of people to recommend a CBD oil with these properties. Most people want to THC so haven't gotten anywhere. It's so hard to know where to start on this path. Thank you so much
8850 2018-02-01 04:14:48 Oil diffusers are okay and common in homes now a days, the problem is the pyramid schemers telling people certain brands are safe for animals. They aren’tx
8851 2018-02-01 04:14:44 What ever can be posted on news papers,are we seeing it's  effects already ,my take is the crude oil has rose to $70 a barrel, to what effect does it benefit  our economy ,now rise in crude ,there should also be a drop in dollar exchange right.

8859 2018-02-01 04:14:16 Lol. Yeah that’s terrible. I remember that year well. My company went under that year from a bone head decision I made to work with a bigger company and didn’t get paid then they filed bankruptcy. Bush didn’t care about the people unless they had some oil. That man & his oil. 
8860 2018-02-01 04:14:15 China is big on Solar. Russia exports oil.

8865 2018-02-01 04:13:58 I just remember that after the record was set in 1970, by 1974 there was an oil embargo that led to extreme shortages at the pump.
8866 2018-02-01 04:13:57 Nothing can even breathe and oil.
8867 2018-02-01 04:13:46 Aloe Vera straight from the plant is great for skin tone and hyperpigmentation. Can be drying so I sometimes put my Shea butter on after. Eucalyptus oil is underrated in cleaning your face, works better than tree tea oil, I put a few drops in my witch hazel and rose water toner

8908 2018-02-01 04:08:30 Mix a few drops of oil with 1/2 cup of room temp water and a pinch of salt. Put it in a spray bottle and mist it over the blanket until it feels a little damp like febreeze. Let it dry and you should be good for at least a day.

8912 2018-02-01 04:08:01 BHA (salicylic) is oil soluble, so gets inside your pores. AHA mostly eats dead skin on the surface of your skin. I like to use both, but it's better to start with one or the other.

8931 2018-02-01 04:05:38 Your impressed by #FakeFacts from Trump? He signed XOs to give the mentally disturbed guns, another to allow oil companies to dump frack waste into our rivers.

8934 2018-02-01 04:05:12 We all live in the same oil dependent world- our action was to stop oil exploration- not end oil use immediately. Driving home would be ironic, but not hypocritical.

8936 2018-02-01 04:04:42 Very important trend from the macro perspective for Indian equities. This along with the EV revolution should hopefully keep OIL prices in check
8937 2018-02-01 04:04:39 Maybe different practice in HK? On SG usually service every 6 months, and the package would include change of engine oil by default.

8942 2018-02-01 04:04:14 @HondaCustSvc Issues with our ‘08 Accord. Had to fill oil every other week. This went on for a few months. VSA lights & shut itself off in October. Mechanic replaced timing belt. Same thing in December now it won’t start. Keep reading about oil consumption lawsuit. Advise?
8943 2018-02-01 04:04:13 L’Occitane almond oil is heaven in a bottle. Bless Sephora for giving me the opportunity to spend a year’s worth of reward points on a half-ounce bottle and feeling fortunate for the privilege.
8944 2018-02-01 04:04:13 I put a bowl of water onto of my pellet stove with a couple drops of essence oil

8946 2018-02-01 04:03:42 When int'l oil prices were all time low. Govt took credit for price reduction. Now, Govt. should be held responsible for the increase! #Bunchofidiots
@MaryamNSharif
8947 2018-02-01 04:03:33 That is what we are hearing on solar as well. Wind is just a scam by the environmental lobby and big money people wanting to cash in on subsidies. I have gas lines and oil wells all over the land that I farm. Less intrusive than windmills.

8949 2018-02-01 04:03:30 But what if you’re allergic to peanuts and peanut oil. If that’s the case I’m pretty sure it’s safe for them to say that Canes is better than Chic fil a. 
8950 2018-02-01 04:03:21 Thank God I remembered too get my oil changed today.
8951 2018-02-01 04:03:16 Sorry to hear. Trust Lord heals you. We get aches & pains, Is this from us or our food some say less Oil & Fired Food. Bible talks about Fat is the Lords, & "Stiff Necked" people like Eli, who were heavy, eating the Fat.  Been there. I listened to Lord and cut Oil, Better for me

8957 2018-02-01 04:02:27 I personally know dispensary owners who gave people cannabis flower buds, as well as cannabis oil and other products, for free because they could not afford it. One guy never charged for children's medicine needs.
8958 2018-02-01 04:02:20 fish oil is really good for balancing hormones! they sell it at cvs walgreens and walmart(: also green tea helps A LOT... hormonal acne used to be my worst enemy...

8970 2018-02-01 04:00:50 I had to get my brakes fixed today. Never got my brakes or anything but an oil change on my car since I bought it. Getting my brakes changed made me really feel like I need a new car. I may be being dramatic but I’m serious af.  #comingnewSOON

8985 2018-02-01 03:59:10 I don’t know what you mean? How do you pick anybody for torture?  Another technique: pour boiling oil in the ear canal. I think the Powhatans got pissed when the English lied and said they were not really going to settle on their land. I’m not the history buff in the family.

8989 2018-02-01 03:58:21 I’ll make it for you whenever! I just sautéed mushrooms and spinach in olive oil. Boiled vegan friendly pasta and added a little bit of marinara sauce  Sooo easy, quick, and cheap

9000 2018-02-01 03:56:20 I’m finally catching on that “Let’s meet for lunch sometime this week” Is my Dad’s code phrase for “Let’s meet so I can check your car’s tire pressure and also make sure you’ve changed your oil recently, and while we’re at it, have you replaced your break pads this year?”
9001 2018-02-01 03:55:49 Talking to the guy with the same blower I’m getting and he doesn’t have nothing done to the motor, like I can’t risk blowing my oil pump gears and messing up my motor

9005 2018-02-01 03:54:48 I would change engine oil at every servicing, i.e. 6 months apart.
9006 2018-02-01 03:54:44 I looooove the night serum and the luxury face oil . it worked wonders for my skin !

9009 2018-02-01 03:54:00 Similar to today, most of the richest people in the world invested or moved into an up and coming business early on. Rockefeller did similar as he left his $3.50 a week job and moved into the oil business just as it began to thrive.
9010 2018-02-01 03:53:59 So for about a year I’ve had these red acne scars on my face, they weren’t deep, they just looked like red spots on my cheek, and for the last 2-3 weeks I’ve been using rose hips oil every night AND THE SCARRING IS FINALLY GOING AWAY!!
9011 2018-02-01 03:53:58 is it coconut oil and rose water

9018 2018-02-01 03:52:20 China is such a game changer. If they make a decision to go in a different direction with energy policy - it will happen. Look at their buy-in to solar.  Will always need some oil for heavy industry I imagine.
9019 2018-02-01 03:52:13 Final: Oil Caps defeat Wolverines 4-1. Thiessen and Kirkup with the goals in the third for Virden.

9020 2018-02-01 03:52:00 Oil belongs in the ground so please think about all the bad things that's happened since discovering oil and bringing it above the ground.
9021 2018-02-01 03:51:45 And how will you keep US agriculture going since it is all mechanized and runs on fossil fuel? Middle East wars are over THAT oil, you know.
9022 2018-02-01 03:51:42 Have you looked at their garbage fundamentals?  Should have been 0 during oil glut of 15-16'
9023 2018-02-01 03:51:41 The @BangkoSentral expects January inflation between 3.5-4% given higher oil & food prices, plus the impact of higher taxes due to the TRAIN law. @bworldph

9029 2018-02-01 03:50:58 Who has huge stake in oil? Putin. Certainly. Trump? (as part of a deal we don't know about yet? Rostnef?) Maybe. So this could be another way to line Putin and Trump's pockets (and the pockets of other key stakeholders we don't currently know about.) That's my theory.
9030 2018-02-01 03:50:51 What reforms, this govt is looting people in the name of oil taxes.

9041 2018-02-01 03:49:29 Aw. It sucks. I've been using an electric face brush and that helped, but it's a cheap one from oil of olay. Recently switch to cerave face wash to see if it helps too. It's super cheap.

9048 2018-02-01 03:48:19 Why not? Republicans insisted on cutting any aid to Solyndra. It was a fraction of the aid given to oil companies and oil companies are the most profitable companies in the history of the planet. Does any of this make sense? Of course not.
9049 2018-02-01 03:48:06 Trump or whoever’s telling him what 2do renominating Ms. White is just proof that Trump administration is following dictates of big oil+gas Koch network +other superrich libertarians.

9056 2018-02-01 03:47:03 When were we asked? Maybe I should ask when did bullying, yelling, trolling, lies, misinformation campaigns and straight up corruption become 'asking'? Our climate plan under the BC Libs was first a show, then the results tossed and replaced from inside Alberta oil boardrooms.
9057 2018-02-01 03:47:02 Why do models need another person to rub baby oil on? Can you not lube your self up for the shoot or what's the deal
9058 2018-02-01 03:47:01 Hmm sadly crude oil prices have gone up worldwide ... not possible for the Govt to do so without increasing our fiscal deficit. Best to move away from fossil fuels and invest in clean energy
9059 2018-02-01 03:46:55 Destroy our natural resources! There is a reason for coming to Oklahoma for Scott Pruitt! Oil man bought and paid for! Crook!  He will have investigators after him all the time! Plain and simple —- CROOK!

9064 2018-02-01 03:46:05 I believe because fossil fuel, clean energy allow many others to build success and make a big difference. As long as he keep things back in time his old rich oil buddies keep the money and power.
9065 2018-02-01 03:45:52 Had drinks with an old brokerage  friend that work at ICE now them dudes obnoxious. His coworker told a sista he work oil markets she went home with him, game is game...
9066 2018-02-01 03:45:44 I argued with a Kenney supporter that this was even happening. He told me they couldn’t use driverless trucks in the oil sands mines.
I told him they already were and it was possible for the truck operator to be sitting in Calgary. They don’t “get it”.
9067 2018-02-01 03:45:42 My back was extra painful today. I took 2 full droppers of CBD oil for the first time and it went away within half an hour. I’m a little shook.
9068 2018-02-01 03:45:33 I tweet for the women whom mix their bath and body works body cream with baby oil gel. I feel like a million bucks too.
9069 2018-02-01 03:45:33 The difference is: I assume risks to my own safety when flying. An oil spills could ruin a coastline for everyone. We're stewards of that. It's irresponsible.

9071 2018-02-01 03:45:10 How is coconut oil for the skin ?
9072 2018-02-01 03:45:09 if you thoroughly clean your face & use the RAW VIRGIN coconut oil , it will not clog your pores or cause breakout .
9073 2018-02-01 03:45:08 need some iron pills but that shit taste like fish oil

9078 2018-02-01 03:45:02 I will never mix Victoria's Secret lotion with coconut oil again. I called myself using the coconut oil mainly for moisture and the VS lotion for the scent. I thought it'd be more moisturizing to mix the two and it was a complete fail!  I'll just stick to using them separately.

9083 2018-02-01 03:44:01 So he, Putin et al. can sell oil at high prices. Grifters.....we see you Trump and you gonna go down..... hard.

9085 2018-02-01 03:43:58 U.S. oil production rose by 77% under Obama while gas production rose by 33%.

There is no #waronenergy, there's one industry - coal - that you give special treatment to because it comes from swing states. It's pathetic.
9086 2018-02-01 03:43:56 One breath at a time Jayme give yourself permission to feel this way. Out of that small steps (a walk, a hot bath, a cuddle with the critters). Peppermint essential oil roll on and a eucalyptus scented candle does wonders. Sending healing thoughts

9101 2018-02-01 03:41:50 I don't know why I have to end every day with a layer of oil on my face. I'm not sure what threat my pores think they're responding to. It's like there are tiny daleks in my face chanting "LUBRICATE."
9102 2018-02-01 03:41:38 This what no economic plan B looks like in AB and SK, slagging on BC to prop up their oil glut even if it means wiping out the occupations of thousands that depend on an oil free coast line! There is no way that there not be a catastrophic spill with ramped up tanker traffic!

9105 2018-02-01 03:41:16 I agree terrible result, then there will be those Drs that say "have u tried lavender oil" ? And off u go empty handed.. #codinemakesmesickanyway. Stomach bleeds next problem from anti inflammatory meds being over used !

9107 2018-02-01 03:40:36 Tillerson is a longtime Putin associate, he was hand picked by putin 2 lift all sanctions vs Russia & deliver the $500 billion oil deal.
9108 2018-02-01 03:40:36 It is heartbreaking as a parent of a special needs kid to see the state I love suggest that kids with seizures are not important and should go back to living with 30-50 seizures a day b/c CBD oil is "bad". Everyone knows it's only bad for big pharma. @KSAGOffice @GovJeffColyer
9109 2018-02-01 03:40:33 high-ish heat and good amount of oil for crispy bottom, very short flip (under 15 seconds?) to finish the tops?
9110 2018-02-01 03:40:32 You post an info chart that agrees w your pro pipeline view and don't mention that the co. that did the poll happens to be or has worked for oil interests in past. Can you say bias? Or maybe "padded numbers"? That chart has no credibility.

9112 2018-02-01 03:40:23 The sheets are fine, but the pillowcases are retinol and argan oil graveyards, lol. I soaked them in a 1/2 scoop of Oxi and water. In the dryer now--we'll see how they turned out soon.

9117 2018-02-01 03:39:37 Routine is like: 150 ml coffee w/ sugar and Brite. Work ass off for 4.5 hours. Lunch is sandwich with cheese/meat or salad with meat, oil & vinegar dressing - and a SWEET. Nap. Early normal dinner.  30 min. walk at night. Repeat. Not exactly a weight loss diet, is it...

9125 2018-02-01 03:38:53 I stop using face moisturizer because they all suck. All I have been using is witch hazel and coconut oil and it is honestly the best thing.
9126 2018-02-01 03:38:19 Change a tire. Change my oil. Change windshield wipers. Refill blinker fluid. I can do it all.

9134 2018-02-01 03:37:47 Omg! The remove is the best. The other alternative is Clinique but it’s expensive. I pretty much just use a cleansing oil and cleansing water like bioderma or garnier has one

9138 2018-02-01 03:37:26 Yes we have been able to live without oil for decades but big oil has hindered progress. If hay was more profitable we would still be riding horses to work.

9140 2018-02-01 03:37:10 How to scam old daddies #ACSVersace 
1.) Always gas them up
2.) let them know "you in the area" by surprise
3.) even if you wear glasses still look cute in gap clothes
4.) talk shit, lie, say you the daughter of oil tycoon in europe
5.) Always carry a backpack and be sassy
9141 2018-02-01 03:36:56 Good morning Maynilaaaaa!
9142 2018-02-01 03:36:53 One thing I’m swearing by right now is drunk elephant’s baby facial and marula oil!!! It’s a little pricey but I swear so worth it. It’s completely changed my skin.

9148 2018-02-01 03:36:30 I dare @KSAGOffice to come spend a day with those of us that have kids that benefit from CBD oil and to our face tell us that what is helping them is illegal and they have to go back to living in the shell that the meds made our kids. Pathetic.
9149 2018-02-01 03:36:24 Obsessed with lip balm/oil and there’s only two that do it for me.

9155 2018-02-01 03:35:27 May I reflect? I love me a good ribeye.  But an okay piece of meat can be made into delicious magic with the right technique. However a mediocre batch of olive oil can not be changed.
9156 2018-02-01 03:35:23 Glad to hear. Gotta keep the oil pressure within spec.
9157 2018-02-01 03:35:15 i been using coconut oil on my skin & hair and nothing bad has happened .. going on 6 years now ..
9158 2018-02-01 03:35:13 oil diffusers are the cauldrons of 2018
9159 2018-02-01 03:34:39 so now everybody is anti coconut oil now ?
9160 2018-02-01 03:34:38 He’s the liberal Venezuela oil connection that a few years ago all the dems favored..... now look at Venezuela!!!
9161 2018-02-01 03:34:26 he/she appreciates people getting killed, oil prices rising every week, corrupt people getting together?
9162 2018-02-01 03:34:08 This game has been sloppy -- stock car, mud track, oil leaking sloppy.

9174 2018-02-01 03:33:18 Had a v painful (but excellent) massage. They put some menthol oil on my back and shoulders afterwards and walking to my car in the rain afterwards was a super weird experience.
9175 2018-02-01 03:33:16 I think coconut oil works for everything 
9176 2018-02-01 03:33:14 My nanny mom just complimented my skin and asked what I did. I told her I just cleanse with coconut oil and she scoffed saying, “Well, I would break out doing that.” Well, don’t ask if you’re gonna be a hater. #manhattanmoms
9177 2018-02-01 03:33:10 Only in AB. It's not the federal government's fault that the oil industry shot itself in the foot (again). No one forced horizontal drilling and fracking on the industry. Meanwhile, enhanced EI for AB's downturn cost $2b more than expected. Pipelines? Look at the Harper record...
9178 2018-02-01 03:33:08 Funny story. My sister got some not peanut butter with some seeds in it and it was "natural". I tried it, it was not good. Also it was part oil, part the rest. I'm not sure how she ate it. She was the only one who did I heard.
9179 2018-02-01 03:33:04 World wobbles because we pumping oil, we mind the coal, metals and gas. We pump subterranean water, earth is rotating and the empty cavities have to be filled. The earth is using it's inner layers to fill the gaps and the top of our planet changes.We have mud slides and others...
9180 2018-02-01 03:32:51 Have you noticed how the price of oil has been going steadily up for the last year? That's why #Tillerson hasn't quit yet. He needs to get more $$ for his shadowy cadre of oil barons.

9185 2018-02-01 03:32:04 That's great! Lemon oil can cause anaphylaxis in those with MCS, so not a step up from Windex. Vinegar would be better. Clean doesn't have a smell. :)

9188 2018-02-01 03:31:55 Speaking with this guy was interesting to say the least...They believe that they can be a REAL player in the crypto space, and take on BTC itself. Backing it with $250 Billion in oil right out of the gate. Essentially giving it a bigger market cap than BTC has right now.
9189 2018-02-01 03:31:53 yeah and if you have a goldfish or beta fish you need to also remove them from the move you’re using them in... any pets really, it’s not good for them to use any essential oil diffuser tbh. just light a candle or something or rub it on yourself
9190 2018-02-01 03:31:51 @GovJeffColyer Governor, what's your official stance on CBD oil?
9191 2018-02-01 03:31:46 All of my black castor oil just spilled. So that’s how my night is going 
9192 2018-02-01 03:31:45 Duncanson’s oil paintings are so realistic, I wonder how he decided the sizes of each one since they varied quite a lot #ARTH287
9193 2018-02-01 03:31:19 You should tell dad. He loves tea tree oil
9194 2018-02-01 03:31:16 If I remember correctly Indian Oil has started buying US crude & received its first delivered a few months back
9195 2018-02-01 03:31:14 CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The  goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran  so we could access their oil.  Israel works closely with it’s “sister”,  Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause. 
Robert Steele X CIA
9196 2018-02-01 03:31:05 What about data about oil?
9197 2018-02-01 03:30:45 En un mes rindo y aun no tengo la materia preparada, se me fue la mano con la vagancia.  Dónde quedo mi responsabilidad? En Bkn? En Soul? O Fuel Oil?
9198 2018-02-01 03:30:40 Actually there is change in global oil price. But it can be controlled by some subsidies. @CMOTamilNadu
9199 2018-02-01 03:30:14 January 31, 2018 at 10:30PM Waiting for #Ecuador to admit Petroecuador oil spills
9200 2018-02-01 03:30:13 OIL DIFF: 4.48 -> 4.52
9201 2018-02-01 03:30:08 Going to court will tie this up for another 2 years. How about stopping BC exporting across AB to get to the rest of Canada?????? Same thing and stopping oil to tide water
9202 2018-02-01 03:30:08 And yes they most likely they will use eth/ERC20 or tell me why would Putin met with vitalik months ago. They are gonna cause drama in OPEC and chaos in oil industry. Soon we will see $5/gallon gas.
9203 2018-02-01 03:30:05 /rlt/ bio oil belinya dmn?

9211 2018-02-01 03:29:36 You can imagine the convo at Tides SF offices: “We need a word like fracking...” “CanuckCrude!” “No.” “Tar oil.” “Been done.” “Dilbit?” “Ka-Ching!”
9212 2018-02-01 03:29:34 Thanks for the oil! 
9213 2018-02-01 03:29:25 Manaki oka vishayam teliyanappudu calm ga undalandi.. Even pani puri causes cancer. Daily used oil causes cancer. So there isn't any need to laugh bro

9223 2018-02-01 03:27:53 Alaskans know n love EXXON. The company is remembered best for the great job it did not do after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Exxon also used their billions, plundered from the earth, to keep a phalanx of lawyers very well paid, so that the victims of the spill would never be paid
9224 2018-02-01 03:27:50 Didnt bring my eucalyptus oil 
9225 2018-02-01 03:27:46 I love what an oil change does for my fuel.

9230 2018-02-01 03:27:19 cannot see a crash -- wilder swings by 200+ pts yes sometimes 2 or 3 in week by % no so severe as past 
do see 3% on ten yr by July at latest - 2nd rate increase done by then.

I  See 4 increases this yr - unless shale production reduces oil price impacts inflation
9231 2018-02-01 03:27:13 That is a classic description of a con man,snake oil,pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today kind of guy
9232 2018-02-01 03:27:11 So happy and excited for you Jordan! You’re one of the hardest working guys in the sport and it doesn’t go unnoticed! Can’t wait for this season 
9233 2018-02-01 03:27:10 What a bunch of utter bull. He rolled back environmental incentives. It is a crime against mankind. Stick your oil.
9234 2018-02-01 03:26:55 We have seen more than 3 polo gt engines getting replaced and this is oil leakage and not fuel leakage
9235 2018-02-01 03:26:44 It would great if they would investigate; Banks, insurance companies, oil companies, and grocery retailers, drug manufacturer & pharmacies. All of who don't appear to compete.
9236 2018-02-01 03:26:42 @SushmaSwaraj As Qatar has given indians visa on arrival, India should reciprocate and provide Qatari citizens the e-visa facility. Exports to Qatar are around USD 1.5 billion with imports of gas/oil more than USD 10 billion.

9242 2018-02-01 03:25:53 #asksciencemike Doesn't it make sense that some of the cause of global warming would be the removal of enormous amounts of oil from the earth? If not, why not?
9243 2018-02-01 03:25:43 I meant like a cup of coffee but now I need to find it as an essintial oil
9244 2018-02-01 03:25:39 But another penalty to the Oil Kings and we have some 4 on 4 action

9246 2018-02-01 03:25:26 you can get neem oil at Sunshine Garden Supply in Valleyview.
9247 2018-02-01 03:25:17 I feel like this would benefit from more context... what's the historical comparison? Surely Standard Oil or AT&T or Walmart were bigger than the GDP of most countries on earth too - the US is one of the biggest and wealthiest countries historically.
9248 2018-02-01 03:25:15 I had jalapeño oil on my fingers and rubbed my eyes and I’m crying.
9249 2018-02-01 03:25:04 Mission flour tortillas contain interesterified soybean oil and hydrogenated soybean oil in the shortening they use. I didn't notice this until after I became really ill directly after making breakfast burritos. Now I'm sick and drenched in sweat. Good times. #soyallergy #spoonie
9250 2018-02-01 03:24:56 Be careful with essential oils. Tea tree oil and a few others are very toxic to dogs
9251 2018-02-01 03:24:46 I am very bearish oil but am a realist that sentiment change is slow and price action reversal even moreso. With another rig ct increase and another build, weakness should start. A third and even 4th build it should accelerate.
9252 2018-02-01 03:24:38 Nathan randomly started spraying this oil thing on me and is convinced that it will heal me and I won’t be sick tomorrow...we’ll see

9300 2018-02-01 03:17:15 Tam, we can't stop climate change and save the planet from dying, so let's double down on oil and build a new pipeline. What's the point of denying that we can do anything about this? At least we will have jobs in Calgary when people in Vancouver are boiling in  seawater.
9301 2018-02-01 03:17:13 all I would change of national policy is increase solar by 72%, rather than  nuclear build up ,shut down purchase of oil from isis, keep all immigrants and make illegals citizens, open gestation crates,require organic family farms, free birth control ,no new coal, no excel pipe
9302 2018-02-01 03:16:58 Seriously, if you are in for a good idiot leftist laugher - check out #ACrudeAwakening - circa 2006, a bunch of "scientists" that predict we are running out of oil.

9324 2018-02-01 03:14:08 just found out my roommate has been putting canola oil in our bong for the past 2 days to keep resin from building and I don’t know if I should be mad or impressed.
9325 2018-02-01 03:14:04 Regarding the context, their intention is pretty clear: they need capital. This ICO will provide them outside captial to breath. How & whether they will really back their token with real oil that's the question. But I won't take the easy cynical stance. Watching.

9349 2018-02-01 03:10:32 Interesting experiment but I won’t invest because 1/ price of coin seems pegged to the price of oil and Boliviar 2/ just a funding mechanism without real need of bockchain 3/ requires you to trust a government that is about to default on it’s debt
9350 2018-02-01 03:10:32 A pipeline is the safest way to move oil around. The alternative is  more Exxon Valdez and Lac Megantic incidents, and sending more money to human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia.  Opposing those pipelines is incredibly myopic.

9357 2018-02-01 03:09:30 I have larger channels as well (can see them on my oil post this morning) but I took them off to remove clutter & show the similarity between gold and oil more...but I use "internal channels" that sometimes cut through price as support/resistance levels often.
9358 2018-02-01 03:09:26 I’m pretty sure that’s how Monique makes it just with oil. I think it’s gross idk how y’all eat it.
9359 2018-02-01 03:09:25 What about the plastic, which is essentially oil & chemicals. Anyone done any real research on that? Bet it causes cancer, auto-immune and many other conditions. Is it against the law to do research?
9360 2018-02-01 03:09:21 The dominoes are set. Wonder what will tip the first one over.  Higher oil prices and dollar inflation?
9361 2018-02-01 03:09:19 It's complicated really and it all has to do with how we tax oil/pipelines and how they're categorized. Someone that can definitely bring more insight on this subject is David Cay Johnson.

9370 2018-02-01 03:07:30 I too sold ACE when promoter sold at 139, was holding from 92. Went up to 189. Now I have sold Hind oil expl again at 128 after dir sellings
9371 2018-02-01 03:07:26 I’m sorry it ain’t a mf on this planet that can convince me to put coconut oil on my oily ass face.
9372 2018-02-01 03:07:26 Is it so now that they are able to take so much more of the oil out now than in the past.
9373 2018-02-01 03:07:24 ねえBBちゃんとかでマルチエンドだって話をきくんだけど一体何が起こっているのか……
9374 2018-02-01 03:07:20 I enjoy a good shower and afterward I use #27beardco balm in my beard after I get it nice and dry. Throughout the day when my beard has that not so fresh feeling I apply the 27 Beard Co Oil and give it a good brushing it out. #beard #beardbalm #beardoil #etsy #Patreon
9375 2018-02-01 03:07:09 I will take fish oil vitamins and I will start doing different things with my hair
9376 2018-02-01 03:07:04 I'm not debating that it will be expensive or not. It will... Absolutely. And we have to continue using oil but we have to make steps towards better alternatives. And Trump and the Republicans are too deep in the pockets of Oil companies. But we have to start the plans now.

9387 2018-02-01 03:05:46 I think it's fair to say they're both in tandem with the dollar. It's going to be a bloodbath when it breaks. Like March of last year when oil fell from the 50s, except this time from the 60s.
9388 2018-02-01 03:05:22 Jack said hash oil. Good answer #MatchGame
9389 2018-02-01 03:05:20 Hey guys I’ll be online soon  just gonna finish eating super quick.
I have a highish goal I need to reach for pay period, hopefully we can reach it 

Oh and glitter oil tonight 
9390 2018-02-01 03:05:13 Assuming super glue, olive oil will fix that. Don't ask me how I know.

9391 2018-02-01 03:05:08 GOOD, I felt like oil was the only one
9392 2018-02-01 03:05:05 ถ้าไปบอกด้วยยย

9398 2018-02-01 03:04:51 So I’ve added hyaluronic acid, a good moisturizer, vitamin c, a good toner, and an oil cleanser to my skincare and my skin is loving it
9399 2018-02-01 03:04:50 Nobody wants to be on the losing side. I would say the odds are not in bad actors favor considering who sits in WH.
9400 2018-02-01 03:04:49 I haven’t done a hair mask in awhile and I spread all kinds of coconut oil over my head tonight so tomorrow it’ll be shiny af.
9401 2018-02-01 03:04:12 i hate oil changes sometimes 
9402 2018-02-01 03:04:11 Outrageous! @realdonaldtRump looking to SLASH renewable energy & energy efficiency by up to 72% to push "clean coal" & oil. (202)224-3121
9403 2018-02-01 03:04:06 
9404 2018-02-01 03:04:06 Okay so...why is coconut oil bad? I use it on my face...doesn't make me dry...doesn't make me break out...
9405 2018-02-01 03:04:05 Those stats are totally misleading. Look at Ivanpah. It still burns tons of natural gas to produce the solar energy it does. Also the cost matters too. Contrary to initial thought, solar is still pricey. As long as oil is cheaper to acquire, then oil will be used.
9406 2018-02-01 03:04:01 Nah it’s banking and oil. Petrodollar protectionism. We (more specifically Halliburton) sold Iran nuke tech. The siege was to instigate them into weapons development for an excuse to invade.

9409 2018-02-01 03:03:29 Hell yea, and it ain’t from the oil. Dude came home from the barbershop the other week with his hairline sprayed

9414 2018-02-01 03:02:46 Vitamin E oil is the best thing i ever did for my face
9415 2018-02-01 03:02:38 I leave it as it comes. It will wither a good deal in the oil. Personally I prefer a little bit more fat.
9416 2018-02-01 03:02:37 SCOTUS, ProLife, Immigration, Tax Cuts, Pro Clean Coal, Deregulation, Renegotiating Nafta, Expanding Oil Drilling, Wiped Out Isis...all conservative.  Like I said, you are an idiot.
9417 2018-02-01 03:02:37 :Your probably right but what I'm observing is a rising recurrence of A Greenspan's irrational exuberance in the oil sector

9419 2018-02-01 03:02:21 Wow .. this ban was from the 70s oil shock, right? I didn’t know it held till recently. The US never fails to surprise in these matters.

9421 2018-02-01 03:01:29 @Mika_Tan My cousin is doing an oil painting of me as Thor. When its done will send you a pic.
9422 2018-02-01 03:01:23 They busted our balls talking about Americans supplying Lebanese army with whatever they needed to protect borders, I'd like to see Americans doing that if Israel decided to put their hands on our oil

9424 2018-02-01 03:01:07 Cut all oil and gas shipments to BC and maybe walking will do them good in the rain.  Tree huggers live in dream land.

9434 2018-02-01 03:00:25 Gotta restock. Been burning oil at midnght ;) putting in Xtra hours @ work but looking down the barrel @ a 3 day weekend :)) who ya rooting for?
9435 2018-02-01 03:00:23 it just acts as an extra layer against oil and creasing. i think it even allows the foundation to apply better, last longer, and have better coverage!
9436 2018-02-01 03:00:14 I have a lot of respect for James Comey He stood by his resolve to maintain his integrity when Trump wanted him to pledge his loyalty to him

9438 2018-02-01 03:00:02 Showering,putting on coconut oil, and then putting on my sweats is my fav part of the night 
9439 2018-02-01 02:59:56 I got rose scent but may add some other oil too
9440 2018-02-01 02:59:52 You informed us months ago about Exxon's interest with Putin in the oil reserves worth trillions. THIS IS WHY TILLERSON IS HEAD OF STATE. Stay on top of this @maddow! We need sanctions NOW!
9441 2018-02-01 02:59:49 What do you expect from the Gas Oil Puppets?
9442 2018-02-01 02:59:47 Especially if you hire thugs to interdict an oil or cargo ship and you made brand new islands in S China Sea
9443 2018-02-01 02:59:24 Another oopsie. Man the well oiled machine needs some oil. Maybe Russia could send a tanker.
9444 2018-02-01 02:59:10 My #selfcare tools: lavender essential oil, a good book, sleep, puppy cuddles, a hug, friends & family. #BellLetsTaIk #Mentalhealth
9445 2018-02-01 02:59:06 Buy a solar panel today and get even with Trump and his oil friends today.  They cannot stop progress,  they cannot tame our hearts.
9446 2018-02-01 02:59:03 I drink water all day and I just clean my face with dove soap. Sometimes I rub it down with olive oil. Nothing fancy lol.
9447 2018-02-01 02:59:02 It seems ok as I haven't seen any resistance to Saudi oil tankers on east coast, where they pay world price for that oil which has all sorts of human rights issues attached to it.  I just don't know that tourism $ will be sufficient to pay the way to the future, hope so too.
9448 2018-02-01 02:58:45 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
9449 2018-02-01 02:58:44 Oh right.  But Mulder went through both. Remember he was first exposed to the black oil in the season 4 2-part episode Tunguska Terma episode and he was abducted in the Requiem episode
9450 2018-02-01 02:58:33 Forget taking them to court and spending tax payers money.  Stop shipping oil and gas and let them walk to work
9451 2018-02-01 02:58:25 LMAO!!  Alaska apparently has moose, gold, oil, snow, the Palin family & the grammar police!!

HAHAHAHAHA!!!!
9452 2018-02-01 02:58:19 U mean more pollution for our air,dirty streams & oil slicks for the coastal waterways, except Florida
9453 2018-02-01 02:58:16 Sweet corn chowder.. Who the fuck cares?  Spoiler.. The cons are not  in power.. And wont be for at least 2 more  majorities.

9455 2018-02-01 02:58:11 I was the one that went that far, no way I could push open up hill, I tried to leave snow down by the oil road but must have melted
9456 2018-02-01 02:58:06 We dont have the means to live without oil. Where do you come up with this tripe? Because a few Tesla models were released? Howd you get to the Grammys?
9457 2018-02-01 02:57:43 WMD's that never existed and a bunch of oil that now belongs to America. I'll tell you what, I'll support a structured, small scale assassination of KJU but not a full blow war. The people of NoKo have done nothing to deserve how they get treated now, and all I hear from the US
9458 2018-02-01 02:57:40 Maybe was getting his oil changed.....
9459 2018-02-01 02:57:39 Ending importation of oil to North America should be a priority. It is a matter of energy independence, national security and economy. Why isn't it part of NAFTA ?
9460 2018-02-01 02:57:37 my brother said my eyes look greasy cuz I got Castor oil on my eyelashes 
9461 2018-02-01 02:57:34 Cabbage, green beans, corn, okra, butter beans, peas, turnip greens, collards, potatoes, carrots, peppers, cauliflower... I love boiled broccoli tossed in olive oil w/ salt & pepper. It's my quick go to
9462 2018-02-01 02:57:27 I use so much OIL in my nightly routine, it’s sort of ridiculous. But seriously i stay fuckin fresh and hydrated like a damn baby all year long 
9463 2018-02-01 02:57:15 It’s AMAZING! & you can throw a bit of oil in if you want, but you don’t have to! Just do it on a low heat!!

9465 2018-02-01 02:57:09 Better start saving now for clown college, and come over here and I'll show you how to change the oil in your juggling pins
9466 2018-02-01 02:56:56 Never had a chance. when I visited world bank, was like a Roman brothel, everyone propositioned me for NZ taxpayers money. Buy Mozambeque oil debts here, fund Latin FTA research there etc
9467 2018-02-01 02:56:53 Sometimes it could be the oil pressure switch ?
9468 2018-02-01 02:56:48 Alberta is more than happy to live with oil patch pollution & environmental damage. So be it!

9472 2018-02-01 02:56:08 But it's all ok because they've just found a whole lot more oil in the north sea...glub, glub, glub, glub, glub.
9473 2018-02-01 02:55:58 I use Argon oil for shine
9474 2018-02-01 02:55:55 She was abducted. Mulder was exposed to the black oil and survived.
9475 2018-02-01 02:55:53 Indeed, let's bring on more oil tankers from Saudi Arabia up and down Canada's coast.  I'm sure that incidents like the Exxon Valdez would never happen to virtue-signalling Canadians.  
9476 2018-02-01 02:55:30 You’re welcome. Grapeseed is a pretty light oil.
9477 2018-02-01 02:55:09 When was Scully exposed to the black oil
9478 2018-02-01 02:55:08 is there a "small oil"?
9479 2018-02-01 02:55:05 Hi! Thank you! It should be fine. It’s not a heavy oil at all.
9480 2018-02-01 02:55:05 I'm not sure about that dropplet of red liquid after the squish... definitively not oil though!
9481 2018-02-01 02:54:59 There wouldn't ever be any oil & gas drilling off the Washington or Oregon coast! None!
You hysterical boobs can't even produce proof that surveys have been conducted!

My $Spy calls should be 100% by tomorrow open so I have that going for me .. wish it was $Slv though. Also red on my $USO puts. Can’t catch a break with oil .Uptrend holds
9484 2018-02-01 02:54:54 Yes he is. He gets upset when looney liberals don’t understand them. Facts and liberals are like oil and water.

9487 2018-02-01 02:54:16 William is more human than human. He is special. He probably received his Alien DNA from BOTH Mulder and Scully. They were both exposed to the black oil/Alien abduction. William was born with abilities.
9488 2018-02-01 02:54:10 HOLY SHIT YOU'VE OPENED MY EYES. That part where I said Trudeau sends oil to America? FUCK! That must have been a fever dream. 

Why are you telling me stuff I know and have already said is shit? You HONESTLY think I don't argue the same thing about Canada?

9491 2018-02-01 02:53:54 And give a big thanks to Trump personally destroying our protection of lands that are now up for sale to big Oil.
9492 2018-02-01 02:53:52 i have made a horrible mistake.... don't EVER get fish oil on your counter... and don't take fish oil that smells rancid before or after the "bite test".... send fabreeze
9493 2018-02-01 02:53:43 I’m ready get a durag so i can saturate my hair in coconut oil at night
9494 2018-02-01 02:53:40 That’s literally the exact scenario of my last oil change 
9495 2018-02-01 02:53:35 Take a square bake dish, line with parchment paper and coat with melted coconut oil. 
Pour chocolate into dish with paper and let cool until it can be placed into the fridge to set.
Once set, cut into squares roughly 1/2 inch square. 
Enjoy! Can be frozen for a month in wax paper
9496 2018-02-01 02:53:27 Maybe that's why America is investing so much into new oil tech and drilling homeside. Hedging the bets.
9497 2018-02-01 02:53:09 trader joe's didn't have peanut oil or garlic what the fuck is my life
9498 2018-02-01 02:52:45 This guy just handed me a flower because he thought I was crying...I explained to him how I was just wiping the oil from my nose and glasses so they would stop slipping down my oily ass face and wow I should have just lied and said I was crying. Why am I like this?
9499 2018-02-01 02:52:44 In a poll by Vancouver Sun 77.33 percent of people said NO to restricting the flow of alberta oil through BC. NDP out O touch with BC people
9500 2018-02-01 02:52:37 Oh yes, that one is important. Retinol, collagen, vitamin C, and rosehip oil are great for anti-aging!
9501 2018-02-01 02:52:27 What greases an old waffle iron the best mine keeps on sticking and ruining my waffles.  Thinking like peanut oil might work
9502 2018-02-01 02:52:14 Wait... It'll go lower... Way too many oil production and the theme will be too much gas production as well.
9503 2018-02-01 02:52:02 I am not suggesting more capex. I am concerned with investment strategy. When Investor A sells floated oil co shares to Investor B, the result is simply a change of ownership and zero effect on demand or GHG.

9508 2018-02-01 02:51:29 Yeah I know but we need rev + tax $ to build infrastructure while oil is still worth $. Yes there is risk and that needs to be handled but there is risk in hydro, nuclear, wind too.  You know Saudi tankers travel the st Lawrence because we have no pipe east.  It's a lose lose
9509 2018-02-01 02:51:22 A tanker blew up and sank in the China Sea, lost with all hands.  It was carrying diluent, used to dilute bitumen?  Remember Lac Megantic?  That was under your watch as Cons.  After 25 years, there is still oil from the Exxon Valdez.  Think about it.  There is no coastline in AB.
9510 2018-02-01 02:51:15 Fuck Neutrogena and coconut oil, use black soap and shea butter

9512 2018-02-01 02:50:58 To clarify we have plenty of oil to meet our own needs but a large amount is being left in the ground
9513 2018-02-01 02:50:52 Its cheaper to import, haber process uses so much electricity which ultimately pushes operating costs high. We are basically  importing the major raw material, its happening in cooking oil industry as well.
9514 2018-02-01 02:50:34 me, eating doritos in bed, but like.. with a candle lit and essential oil diffuser on so it’s still ~healthy~
9515 2018-02-01 02:50:33 well...I definitely was on medication too! BUT to avoid smelling stuff and triggered puking I put peppermint oil on a kleenex and shoved it up my nose! Useful!
9516 2018-02-01 02:50:31 Spoken like an Albertan that doesn’t have any oceanfront to flog her oil.
9517 2018-02-01 02:50:30 oil + seeds for one lab, water + DMM for another.
9518 2018-02-01 02:50:28 [TXT]: Your probably right. 

*Looks up a good market close by* 

[TXT]: What about massage oil? Do you have some?
9519 2018-02-01 02:49:55 Isaiah 61:3 to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.
9520 2018-02-01 02:49:54 Soustral scores early in the 2nd stanza. 2-0 Oil Kings. #KTNvsEDM #BellLetsTalk
9521 2018-02-01 02:49:51 Oh, and the bidder should read the OB propaganda piece when they killed the RSA--Ana shrieked--the "people" cannot/must not pay more than 21 cents/kWh"!!!!! Oil is 50% higher now then it was then--I guess Ana's got a major beef now with OPEC and Russia
9522 2018-02-01 02:49:34 My skin all of a sudden became EXTREMELY dry. I can't take it. I'm scratching like crazy  I have baby oil and lotion all over me
9523 2018-02-01 02:49:33 WVU is leaking oil! 2 games back of #KUbball
9524 2018-02-01 02:49:33 They hate trains. Too efficient. Even diesel locomotives are very efficient. Don't forget, there was a purposeful conspiracy in the 50's & 60's by big oil & Detroit to replace street cars & passenger rail w/ buses & more cars and freight trains w/ trucks. It mostly worked.
9525 2018-02-01 02:49:27 Coconut oil is not for everybody 
9526 2018-02-01 02:49:23 The potsticker method: heat oil in nonstick pan over medium-high; add dumplings and fry for 30 seconds; pour in 1/4 cup water and cover. Lower heat and cook for 5-7 minutes. That’s all!
9527 2018-02-01 02:49:18 Rub you down with baby oil then stick my  in your  hole.
9528 2018-02-01 02:49:17 ~I like butter with those, not oil.
9529 2018-02-01 02:49:13 Don't know if I'd go that far. I'd settle for him being a fake Christian who uses religion to con people for support. He has all the authenticity of a snake oil salesman.
9530 2018-02-01 02:49:06 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
9531 2018-02-01 02:49:06 The oil in her car!
9532 2018-02-01 02:49:04 My girl just put me on to it. Great oil based cleanser which works better for my type of oily skin. And its reasonably priced too. The c firma from DE is legit though even if it’s only good for 2 months
9533 2018-02-01 02:49:02 I use a becca foundation, it’s pricy but I LOVE for oil control
9534 2018-02-01 02:48:59 I got lavender oil for my diffuser and I am immediately calmed. This was a great decision to make today.
9535 2018-02-01 02:48:59 @TripleMAdelaide Midnight Oil - Weddingcake Island - loving it #classic
9536 2018-02-01 02:48:53 Great value oil free ultra gentle face moisturizer for sensitive skin 
Lancôme creme radiance + tonique doucere  
I also love Lancômes Renergie multi life action cream but it's pricey !!
9537 2018-02-01 02:48:36 Every time I see snaps of people cooking in a pan half full of oil it makes me want to puke. How can y’all eat that
9538 2018-02-01 02:48:35 Turkish propaganda is stupid, it was the Erdogan family that traded ISIS, arms and ammunition for oil.Erdogan was getting rich. Turkey created ISIS, helped him, and still helps
9539 2018-02-01 02:48:21 She's gonna need some good anti snake oil venom
9540 2018-02-01 02:48:15 i use the vichy soap normaderm, then i use clean and clear and later i use castor oil as spot treatment. I do this at night. In the morning i wash my face with vichy normaderm again and use sunscreen.
9541 2018-02-01 02:48:05 Yeah I agree. It’s funny when United fans say “They bought their success through an oil rich sheikh, at least we earned it!” Like the PL trophy cares how you got there..... I think our squad is good enough to compete but still very under invested in over the years.
9542 2018-02-01 02:47:57 WTF, @realDonaldTrump ! YOU AND REX LET ALL 3 RUSSIAN SPY CHIEFS TO SECRETLY ENTER USA TO MEET WITH YOU LAST WEEK? FOR WHAT? OIL MONEY? IN YOUR POCKETS? NO SECRETS,DONNY! JAIL FOR U! @FBI @CIA @chelseahandler @Rosie @Lawrence @jimmykimmel @JoyAnnReid @MMFlint @SallyQYates
9543 2018-02-01 02:47:52 What about when you take resources that belong to the people of the country, like the oil, the timber, the gold and other minerals. And you get filthy rich of those resources and the people of the country that have just as much right to those resources get nothing. That's unfair.
9544 2018-02-01 02:47:51 So when the USA runs out of oil, we will have to buy NOT made in America solar panels and wind turbines instead of improving/innovating on our current capabilities and besting foreign competition in this space.  You really want to unemploy American workers now???
9545 2018-02-01 02:47:44 A “lot more” like mercury , lead, PCB’s etc. Use purified fish oil or eat grass finished beef.
9546 2018-02-01 02:47:34 @RachelNotley as a citizen living in B.C., please shut the hell up and find a different way to shill your oil. Keep your filth out of Beautiful BC.
9547 2018-02-01 02:47:28 put oil near my roots and I'm just going to sleep in it because it's too late anyways.
9548 2018-02-01 02:47:13 Using coconut oil on my face every day has really been a game changer
9549 2018-02-01 02:47:09 I like to marinate chicken in Italian dressing or lemon juice and olive oil and some herbs and spices then I just sautée it  if I'm making rice I like to use adobo or Sazon con azafran, cumin, and pepper  
Also caramelizing some onions with your chicken is never a bad idea 
9550 2018-02-01 02:47:00 If u are a large institution as your brooker u are either gold or lithium not both. Big institutes are just that gold lithium silver oil or ect not a multiple company
9551 2018-02-01 02:46:54 I'm just wanting to clarify: I'm not anti oil I'm just anti confederation. I believe BC should be developing much more of its own oil than it is currently as well as our offshore oil. We could be competing with Alberta under the right leadership
9552 2018-02-01 02:46:51 Where’s the oil?
9553 2018-02-01 02:46:50 MILK hydrating oil stick and Dr. Jart water drop moisturizer
9554 2018-02-01 02:46:50 I’m kinda wondering how much insider info Berman and Mahon gave to Horgan seeing as they both sat on Notley’s Oil Sands Advisory Group.
9555 2018-02-01 02:46:44 Buyer Beware...I purchased a Subaru Forester new in 2015. I had oil consumption issues and it took 4 months to acknowledge a false positive on the test. Customer Service doesn't seem to care since I ended up trading for a different brand. Very Poor Customer Service
9556 2018-02-01 02:46:44 Yes, export at world price = close to double west Canada price and thus jobs and tax revenues for all Canadians to spend on improving lives and environment.  Did you think I thought was an import oil pipeline? We already buy enough Saudi oil.
9557 2018-02-01 02:46:38 Oil companies aren't telling shareholders about product side effects.
9558 2018-02-01 02:46:35 @jim_schultz @ChrisCuomo #CuomoPrimeTime james d Schultz story sounds like it was greased with crisco oil.  Stop climbing poles Jim.  Your ethics are not squeaking clean.  Phila Police have plenty excess oil since they decided it didn't stop perpetrators!
9559 2018-02-01 02:46:28 Definitely! It can help us understand pacing, POV, character development, etc.  each genre/format/POV requires a different set of skills. It's like being a painter and switching from acrylics to oil. It challenges in ways unimaginable, but vital for your growth as a painter.
9560 2018-02-01 02:46:20 Add a drop or 2 of tea tree oil for breakouts

9563 2018-02-01 02:45:47 I’m sorry that transitioning to a green planet means you will have to go through a change. But there are so many jobs in the wind and solar industry and they are looking for hard working oil people to join them. This will lead to a better world.
9564 2018-02-01 02:45:46 Cause there’s a puddle of oil under it.. 
9565 2018-02-01 02:45:44  With record oil drilling. Plans to spend up to 70% less on renewable energy, WHY IS GAS SO EXPENSIVE?  Corporations getting sooooo much money. We are being fleeced.  #renewables #TrumpCrimeFamily
#GOPTraitors
9566 2018-02-01 02:45:43 We know you don’t need oil gas and coal Bernie Sanders. You get your from Russia. Amirite comrade? Oh btw.. when will you be releasing your tax returns and FEC filings.. I’ll wait...
9567 2018-02-01 02:45:42 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)
9568 2018-02-01 02:45:42 ... better to learn "help", "oil spill", and "no fishing"
9569 2018-02-01 02:45:42 Burn the midnight oil!
9570 2018-02-01 02:45:33 @CatherineBizTV  We hear lots about the economic aspects of Kinder Morgan but little about the fact that Canada is failing to meet #climatechange targets and continuing to build more oil pipelines locks in more #GlobalWarming . How about working this into the conversation? Thanks
9571 2018-02-01 02:45:19 Not the frackers, oil.
9572 2018-02-01 02:45:05 Wow, that is an oil painting of mine from 11 years ago! Still have the original laying around here somewhere...
9573 2018-02-01 02:44:58 I'm putting up an oil painting of my real mom, Steve Buscemi in my living room
9574 2018-02-01 02:44:58 Come on. Not one of you gives a flying fuck about any of those things. It's all window dressing by a family of grifters. Your father is a snake oil salesman.
9575 2018-02-01 02:44:57 @jsbmbaggedmilk sorry to hear about Bentley, very hard thing to do, hopefully the oil come through for a beet free evening tomorrow.
9576 2018-02-01 02:44:50 Does anyone sell the oil/wax cartridges with the pen already
9577 2018-02-01 02:44:48 not a fond fan of the oil line, and the way its been pushed through. Also not a fan of Site C, and the way THAT has been pushed through either... #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
9578 2018-02-01 02:44:44 I SWEAR BY ROSEHIP OIL DUDE!!
9579 2018-02-01 02:44:39 I agree with the fit me. If you're more oily, that might be more say in than matter. I get a bit oily after a few hours but it's still pretty, also try the new maybelline superstay one. More matte, lasts longer, keep oil more at bay. Also, try a sample of the benefit matte rescue
9580 2018-02-01 02:44:30 Just gonna swim in green tea and coconut oil til my skin gets its shit together

With that being said the real reason we went over there was for oil :/ us Tax payers deserve to know where our $ is going
9593 2018-02-01 02:43:14 Reading the comments on this crappy documentary #ACrudeAwakening are hilarious.  Peak oil, we're going to run out, economic meltdown looms over us....  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

9604 2018-02-01 02:42:19 People have been saying coal and oil are going to run out but they never do. TAKE YOUR SINGLE STEP, TURN IT ALL OFF. Unplug, Be the change. But if you are not doing it quit preaching it.
Its not a moral issue and no one is in danger.

9613 2018-02-01 02:41:51 Yeah only asking because the food there ruins me. Everything cooked in soy oil... Bleh.
9614 2018-02-01 02:41:24 Is it right to still bealiving that venezuela accounts for the largest oil reservoirs in the world?
9615 2018-02-01 02:41:20 Coconut oil!
9616 2018-02-01 02:41:13 Well the interior gets most of its gas from the good ol US of A. Maybe it's time for BC to develop its own oil reserves (and we have plenty) rather than relying on foreign imports of oil
9617 2018-02-01 02:41:10 Tea tree should only be used as a spot treatment because it can dry you out. Use jojoba oil 
9618 2018-02-01 02:41:09 s/o to my boyfriend for changing my oil in my car, buying me food & Starbucks, taking me shopping& buying me a shirt && taking care of me while i was not feeling well today i love you @RonnieSchaeffe2
9619 2018-02-01 02:41:05 Why should BC assume all the risk? BC Oil Industry has a poor on the water response record and lack of a program like the rest of the world moved to after Exxon Valdez. Also, for decades KM can't even service Metro Van fuel needs. Treaties with BCFN? #keithbaldrey
9620 2018-02-01 02:41:04 successful fried rice requires scorched soy sauce (kikkoman only !!), tons of fresh ground pepper, tiny bit sesame oil, green onions. the end
9621 2018-02-01 02:41:03 Yeah right, Chávez bad mouthed the US 20 years ago and they are still the top buyers of Venezuelan oil. Abby Martin is payed by teleSUR, founded by Chávez en the chavista regime to support them. 
The country is on the border of collapse and this woman says otherwise. Sell out!

9626 2018-02-01 02:40:48 just as in painting here you have to paint dark to get light,
when people are disproportionately (imbalance) large, it probably means that they actually feel very small and that they must bulk up to compensate
9627 2018-02-01 02:40:46 BC will not stand by and let big oil destroy our coastline and waterways for short term gain. This is our land and it needs to be protected for future generations.
9628 2018-02-01 02:40:24 that's so dangerous bby ;;; drowsiness could be because even when ur sleeping its not very deep sleep, so before you go to bed, pamper yourself alittle! if nowhere else in your day, take the twenty minutes to massage oil in your hair, put lotion before bed, put on a face mask

9633 2018-02-01 02:40:06 But no, let's just talk about oil and spending billions on defenders. Most major teams if not all have had some kind of financial injection at a given point.
9634 2018-02-01 02:40:03 Once you melt chocolate stir in a bit of vegetable oil. 

You can also buy jars of chocolate sauce that are stabilized at room temperature.
9635 2018-02-01 02:40:03 When you are bald and you moisturize and oil your skin... then spread... the nice breeze blowing certain areas
9636 2018-02-01 02:39:18 I think I’m gonna start oil painting  I wonna paint something new that looks hella realistic
9637 2018-02-01 02:39:17 Hope yours was better than mine, Italian bread and slices of provolone cheese. I was too lazy to make a dipping oil.
9638 2018-02-01 02:39:16 Coconut oil, carmex, any hydrating lip gloss, a lip scrub, etc..
9639 2018-02-01 02:39:13 So my wings were good,not great but i can def build on em...now my whole place just smells like vegetable oil

9641 2018-02-01 02:38:40 I HIGHLY recommend using DoTerra’s “cheer” oil roller ball if you are battling anxiety. I find the smell so uplifting and relaxing. It has helped me tremendously. #bellletstalk
9642 2018-02-01 02:38:40 Pres. Trump said that Detroit is starting to come to life again building cars. This is due to lower corporate taxes. Maybe they will build solar cars so we can get off oil!
9643 2018-02-01 02:38:36 I really need to clean my paint brushes... (it straight up takes an hour to clean my 30+ bbs.) so much oil, so damn much.
9644 2018-02-01 02:38:33 I'm not telling anyone what to do. I'm saying that coal, oil, and gas have got to go. They are going to run out anyway! The longest journey begins with a single step. Stop telling ME what to do, and wake up to the danger that we must confront. It's a moral issue.

9649 2018-02-01 02:37:20 Okay @BahiCosmetics sunflower serum is some kind of crack. I put the oil on before going to work and within my shift my acne DISAPPEARED.
9650 2018-02-01 02:37:18 I’ll try them out. I love the way the oil sheen smells
9651 2018-02-01 02:37:18 Jojoba oil is the most expensive. Almond, Avocado, and Apricot oils are all around the same price. Grapeseed oil is a really great oil and is the cheapest that I know of.
9652 2018-02-01 02:37:02 Trying to save time & money for your business in the oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
9653 2018-02-01 02:37:00 Eco-Terrorist organizations like the World Wild Life fund, the Seira Club and the Pembina institute benefit too - from the funding they receive from Foreign Countries eager to prevent Canadian oil and gas make it to the world market.
9654 2018-02-01 02:36:55 So if you ever suffer from dry scalp/dandruff you can chose from coconut oil/ olive oil/ Aragon oil which ever one you would prefer and just rub it into your scalp and let it sit for 30min (or however long you would like) and wash it off in the shower. And BAM YOU A NEW BITCH!
9655 2018-02-01 02:36:26 Preach it Igo! A few turnips, collards, onions, chopped simmered in olive oil, salt and pepper- add a can of rinsed favorite beans in pan on the side whooee.  Easy to find, easy on the $
9656 2018-02-01 02:36:09 So not only were the doses subtherapeutic but these studies are having the expectations that fish oil is going to treat those who already have an CV event. We know that population has MULTIPLE confounding risk factors & overall may be less health aware.
9657 2018-02-01 02:36:09 En todo de acuerdo, menos en un detalle.
Jamás pudo funcionar a Fuel Oil, no está diseñada ni preparada para eso, funcionó a carbón con el poco que había.
Se acabó ese carbón y la pararon.
No se extraía la cantidad necesaria que requería la usina, aún con 1 sola caldera.

9664 2018-02-01 02:35:24 This may be hard fot you to believe, but there are many of us that hated Trump AND Clinton and feel the Democratic party hgas sold put to corporations.  When Clinton took so much money from corporations, pharmas, and oil and fracking,  she showed us where her loyalty was.
9665 2018-02-01 02:35:15 Why should a government 3000 km away have jurisdiction over our ocean? They also blocked us from drilling offshore oil. Separate from the federal government and start drilling our own offshore oil
9666 2018-02-01 02:34:56 Using a new oil blend in the diffuser tonight...supposed to be good for calming the mind.  I’m not sure my mind has ever been calm, but what the heck, right?   If nothing else, the oil smells pretty good.
9667 2018-02-01 02:34:37 If the market is under duress as it was on Monday and Tuesday of this week, then the lows could be much lower as leveraged crude oil bulls feel the wrath of the margin clerks.
9668 2018-02-01 02:34:35 Started applying the same leave-in conditioning oil I use for my hair onto my eyelashes and I think it’s actually working????
9669 2018-02-01 02:34:24 OMG yes. I grew up in California, but...kale? In an aglio e olio? Bleh.

Also: a persillade of chopped parsley, garlic, olive oil, salt & pepper on good bread is *fantastic*. And really good for you.

9671 2018-02-01 02:33:45 Been saying the same thing  Really guys, going to die on a hill called Cater Page? The shady "oil consultant" who appears on Russian gov TV and has ecstasy eyes, that's your poster boy for possible FISA warrant issues?  Who witnesses you killing a kitten and put you up to this?
9672 2018-02-01 02:33:44 This is all a result of fracking and shale. Tech made it financially possible to get previously “hard-to-get,” oil profitable.
9673 2018-02-01 02:33:37 A late first period goal from Trey Fix-Wolanksy (21) has the Oil Kings on the board in Cranbrook. They lead 1-0 after 1. Shots 10-7 Edmonton. #BellLetsTalk

9682 2018-02-01 02:32:56 Spilled a bottle of lavender oil in my house and now I'm way too chilled out. Someone help!
9683 2018-02-01 02:32:39 Let’s remember that PR also doesn’t have electoral votes. That’s why ultimately Trump doesn’t care. FL and TX have lots. See banning of oil drilling off FL coast. #TrumpRussia

9685 2018-02-01 02:32:34 Short answer: All the political parties are with big oil.

9687 2018-02-01 02:32:12 @dodgecanada Tell me how fluids sweating on an engine aren't a leak?  As far as I know, the oil or coolant that sweats doesn't condense from being in our atmosphere.  And when does sweating become a leak, is there a scientific formula for this?

9691 2018-02-01 02:31:34 Not what I was hoping for! It's like the mixed the seasonings for bbq potato chips with veg oil and poured it over the crunchy chicken. Yuck! #KFCSmokyMountainBBQ
9692 2018-02-01 02:31:29 Tbf it started with the definition of monopoly, standard oil, robber barons and internet companies.
9693 2018-02-01 02:31:19 Crude inventories rose sharply this week and this continues to pull down crude oil prices. Commercial stocks rose by 6.8Mb, the estimate was for a build of only 900Kb.

9701 2018-02-01 02:30:50 It’s a mixture of lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce & garlic cloves mixed up in an immersion blender. LOVE it!! ...but you also have to prepare the kale properly. Take the stem out of it & massage the kale into pieces.

9722 2018-02-01 02:27:22 try ulta’s demi-matte foundation! it’s lightweight but still has great coverage. also the it cosmetics cc cream! for oil control, try setting your primer/moisturizer with powder before applying your foundation. that technique helps with creasing as well!

9724 2018-02-01 02:26:47 I have a pretty lovely deep conditioner and leave in detangeling milk from Aussie that makes my hair ridiculously soft, now I just need to get leave in conditioner, and figure out what oil & cream works in my hair to keep the moisture
9725 2018-02-01 02:26:29 In Ohio few jobs exist in Morrow County, a rural area that never saw growth since 1950's boon in oil wells. Crumbling roads and bridges; no public transportation or taxis.

9740 2018-02-01 02:24:53 The biggest problem for AB oil is transportation costs to tidewater. Pipeline is of course the most cost effective. US is ramping up its production and has greater access to tidewater. Notley is invested in the success of Alberta

9745 2018-02-01 02:23:37 True that. The govt has messed up economy & job creation big time. Inspite of the cushion the low oil prices provided. And now Communal frenzy is whipped up to hide the failures.
9746 2018-02-01 02:23:14 He does but he doesn’t care, after all the financial interests of his friends, Russia & himself lie in Oil, gas & coal ... he claims America First but it has nothing to do with America... it’s a hit & run

9780 2018-02-01 02:19:47 What precisely are they growing faster in? Are people paying taxes in Greece now? Is there a growth in sun beds and suntan oil ? Where’s the action? Olives?

9782 2018-02-01 02:19:34 I put grape seed oil on my top and bottom lashes and I’m PRETTY sure I’m partially blind right now 
9783 2018-02-01 02:19:31 I use castor oil on my lashes and they’re long and thick!!!

9786 2018-02-01 02:19:15 Ok je. But sometimes kalau rasa pores macam tersumbat sebab tak remove sunscreen and makeup properly, thats why its nice to use oil cleanser :)
9787 2018-02-01 02:19:15 @maddow remember last Jan/feb?  Where is the oil?  It’s all about the oil.  Keep looking please.  tRump has stake?
9788 2018-02-01 02:18:44 try to drink Virgin(that’s me) coconut oil. 1-2 tbsp before you sleep
9789 2018-02-01 02:18:38 Exo35:8  And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,  #BibleVerse
9790 2018-02-01 02:18:23 Your made in Alberta social license is not valid outside Alberta Rachel but don’t worry,  in a little over a year you can go back to fighting pipelines and Alberta oil from the other side of the legislature.
9791 2018-02-01 02:18:18 Sleep with coconut oil all up in your hair, it will help it a bit
9792 2018-02-01 02:18:07 Who is familiar with CBD oil and its benefits???
9793 2018-02-01 02:17:54 A good wash I have is the top care version of cetaphil, it’s their gentle wash. Then after that I apply rosehip oil which moisturizes skin and makes it softer and ease acne. This helps the dry skin all over my face in the winter and clears up acne that that
9794 2018-02-01 02:17:53 Oil and vinegar, but together, these two make for fine cuisine listening. After 3+ yrs listening, I finally get it. I think!

9797 2018-02-01 02:17:40 Clearly wasn’t ready to take myself off CBD oil just yet, anxiety through the roof & sleeping pattern completely up the left. Spent about 15 minutes contemplating posting this too . CBD oil works wonders kids, get on it if you need it! 
9798 2018-02-01 02:17:40 This gif is good for a cackle. Next time you or anyone on #teamtypingfast is burning the midnight oil, please envision Cam'ron serenading y'all just like in the "Hey Ma" video
9799 2018-02-01 02:17:39 WOW. I don’t use tea tree oil but I like eucalyptus but eucalyptus seeds are good at repelling fleas
9800 2018-02-01 02:17:32 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
9801 2018-02-01 02:17:20 Got a oil change, car wash, and vacuum/clean the car feels brand new!
9802 2018-02-01 02:17:20 World bank announced in 2019 it won’t fund oil and gas exploration. We need every bank to do that #fossilfree #climateresistance

9804 2018-02-01 02:16:59 I made bulletproof coffee this morning with coconut oil...I will no longer be drinking coffee any other way now 
9805 2018-02-01 02:16:55 Okay so I put some tea tree oil on my face and it is irritating the hell out of my eyes
9806 2018-02-01 02:16:45 Trump said, "We have ended the war on energy". 
Umm, there never was one.. that is until now with the bullshit tax on solar panels.
Guess your oil friends got what they paid you for huh?
9807 2018-02-01 02:16:44 World Bank is responding to peak oil. They don't find it profitable anymore. They're not interested in altruism. They are a key element of global economic colonialism.

9810 2018-02-01 02:16:18 add garlic, olive oil, salt and lemon (optional). Make sure they're dry and raw and the oven is hot. They're ready when the tips go brown.
9811 2018-02-01 02:16:16 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.
9812 2018-02-01 02:16:14 Oil cartridges look like vape juice almost. You just screw them on and hit it. The ones I use have a tank that opens up and you put an actual dab in it and have to reload it every time. It’s a bitch, but you actually get high
9813 2018-02-01 02:16:09 To bad ! Learn to love it! Oil and gas is your future, can’t live without it pal
9814 2018-02-01 02:15:49 i have tried cbd oil. get the higher strength, it’s more effective.

9822 2018-02-01 02:14:33 usually I use baby oil after a shower but my excema is fuckin partying so unfortunately lotion won’t help
9823 2018-02-01 02:14:30 she is a mental moron seriously . These people spite a plastic calculator, because it is made of OIL , but a calculation would find you can't power the world with solar and or wind without deforesting the planet. It would take 100 sq miles per day to keep up with the worlds dema
9824 2018-02-01 02:14:27 Watching people outraged over paying a dime more for a loaf of bread. Meanwhile just filled my car with gas at $1.26 L  with a barrell of oil at $65. BTW same price we paid when it was $126 a barrell. No one cares!
9825 2018-02-01 02:14:26 Back in 2011 when Obama was president and you told me why you didn’t like him cause he gave all the “oil jobs to the Saudis” your exact words I didn’t question you cause I couldn’t relate. You should do the same bro cause this makes you look ignorant

9828 2018-02-01 02:14:06 I think these people don't realize they are breathing the oil?
9829 2018-02-01 02:14:05 She’s the worst of us. She taps into the negative impulses and angry feelings we all have, and she uses them to stir hate and garner attention for herself. She’s a snake oil salesmen in a tight shirt and short skirt, because that’s what her chosen vocation demands. Pitiful.
9830 2018-02-01 02:14:01 I am using electricity-it's all I've got. But I want it to become #fossilfree. That's because harvesting and burning coal and oil and gas is harming us now and will only get worse. Would you tell a flooded-out Houston teacher to stop teaching just because there's no classroom?
9831 2018-02-01 02:14:01 Legs shaved. Hair deep conditioned. Lotion and oil on. Eyebrows plucked. Nails done. Feeling great.
9832 2018-02-01 02:13:59 Sucsefully changed my oil BY MYSELF for the 2nd time (Dad still watched)

9834 2018-02-01 02:13:51 Before I was born, there have been wars in Congo (DRC or Zaire). Why? For what? Diamond, Uranium, Gold, Cobalt, Oil, Tin and so on? Well if you asked, I will tell you that the people of Congo have no use for all those resources until foreigners tell them how valuable they are.
9835 2018-02-01 02:13:41 No doubt, but it is what it is. It’s his oil pipe.
9836 2018-02-01 02:13:34 Trump pushes coal & fossil fuels, ignoring that renewables would give us energy freedom, energy choice, and national security. Wars are fought over oil wells, but not over energy from the sun.

9851 2018-02-01 02:11:10 You can add a little extra cooking oil.

9858 2018-02-01 02:10:21 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
9859 2018-02-01 02:10:21 Got my oil changed today. Mechanic couldn't figure out how to open my hood and now it won't close all the way. Wtf 
9860 2018-02-01 02:10:17 BC it just shows he has done little research.  Once the gov said cigs were ok, lead in gas was ok, pcbs in oil was ok, asbestostos was ok in breaks & insulation oh yea lead in paint, mercury did not cause harm....etc etc etc
9861 2018-02-01 02:10:13 You mean the ones that are charged with 50% coal and oil generated electricity somewhere else?  Isn’t that kinda like letting your dog poop in someone’s yard and not cleaning it up.
9862 2018-02-01 02:10:09 That’s why I want to start the cbd oil. I bought some brownies the other day but they didn’t do much

9866 2018-02-01 02:09:57 #bcpoli @jjhorgan to Alberta:
“Sure, you can build a pipeline through our province; just limit the amount of oil in those pipelines.” Shrewd.

9868 2018-02-01 02:09:25 What "stolen wealth"?

Nonsense.
9869 2018-02-01 02:09:21 He had majorities in both houses and accomplished nothing. He bailed GMC out and GMC repaid with more taxpayers money. If not for oil jobs in Texas and North Dakota there would be fewer jobs in 2016 than there were in 2007
9870 2018-02-01 02:09:16 I'm okay. It's just a balancing act between pain relief and not getting the munchies. I'm adamant about both! Though, I daydream about the day I can just pop down to a dispensary & buy some RS oil. Or make my own. I'd love to do that.

9882 2018-02-01 02:07:39 Right, it’s the catastrophe and pretending that BP was lying about its levels that I’m hating on.  Turns out there’s plenty of oil in the ground and it will be a catastrophe if we burn it, no need to make up mad max stories

9890 2018-02-01 02:06:01 The PCs were incompetent. They couldn't greenwash a city much less a province. The NDP at least greenwashed big oil with our cash and it still failed. So I guess there is a problem in social license where folks don't believe. Curious what UCP will do? @RachelNotley @OilGasCanada

9921 2018-02-01 02:03:16 The government and the media are working together
The #Kochs, #NBC w/ Dems, #FoxNews w/ Reps, big oil, pharma, ISPs (which own CNN & NBC) 
Look at the #FCC
They love #Trump 
He is a gold mine
Giveaways and news views
The FBI are just pawns in these not so #SecretSocieties

9930 2018-02-01 02:01:44 I use a rose oil under it and my skin glistens 
9931 2018-02-01 02:01:44 It’s a dry oil so it really protects your skin while softening it enough to help any ingrown hairs shape up and grown properly. Total life saver, I use it every time I get out of the shower, any place you get heat rash it helps

9934 2018-02-01 02:01:34 Such an incredibly moving programme. I'll be checking my shopping for palm oil, thinking of the Orang Rimba. You are right. We need to take action or there will be nothing left to save 
9935 2018-02-01 02:01:16 Or perhaps the high cost to produce heavy oil. Yeah nothing to do with it eh?
9936 2018-02-01 02:01:14 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9937 2018-02-01 02:01:09 MTE
9938 2018-02-01 02:01:08 Snake oil salesmen!
9939 2018-02-01 02:00:49 Or crude oil
9940 2018-02-01 02:00:38 @FaZeRug Thank God a year ago, Slovenia adopted the law and allowed it to be  used for medical purposes. Nino does not take any more oil and the disease is still in the remission. I hope that's how it will stay !
9941 2018-02-01 02:00:27 Shell is moving to low cost assets - oil sands were, and never will be cheap to produce. Has nothing to do with tax in Canada.
9942 2018-02-01 02:00:22 Karak oil refinery shifted to Kohat where is so called Karak political leaders
9943 2018-02-01 02:00:17 Genesis 15:6 fire mingled with oil for a sin offering, and the woman saw that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Judah, and to put his
9944 2018-02-01 02:00:12 Coal, oil, gas resistance is essential and must be radical and direct. Eco-sabotage is justified. #FossilFree #ClimateResistance
9945 2018-02-01 02:00:10 Last night I mixed vitamin e oil (because I had no other carrier oil) tea tree, lemon grass and peppermint today and based my scalp and I have not been experiencing any itching. At this point in my life I don’t care about the flakes anymore. It’s really the itching
9946 2018-02-01 02:00:06 OIL DIFF: 4.45 -> 4.49
9947 2018-02-01 01:59:52 Lmao yes girl, I mix in some oil and slick my edges back.
9948 2018-02-01 01:59:50 Carter should have given up. He was dishonest - sold to oil money but lied about it. Sold Israel under the bus with lies so big in his book, that 1/2 his staff walked out of their jobs.

We can't give up. But Carter & Obama aren't the ones who fought hard.
9949 2018-02-01 01:59:36 @FaZeRug  I do not know if he would help your Bozliy because I do not know what the effect would have the medicine on the puppy. But ..... Ninotu was helped by cannabis oil. Cannabis was not allowed to be used in our country, but I was ready to try everything for my child.
9950 2018-02-01 01:59:33 Omg life saver. How much canola oil?
9951 2018-02-01 01:59:18 WE HAVE MEANS TO LIVE WITHOUT IT. FUCKING DAMN IT! WE DO, YOU WORRMs! (White Old Racist Republican Misogynists). WE DON'T NEED TO SUCK YOUR SHRINKING STINKING FLAKING WORRM COCKS FOR OIL! DICKS!
9952 2018-02-01 01:59:18 So @GotfriedMLA takes direction from oil executives, and not the public he is supposed to serve.
9953 2018-02-01 01:59:18 I have to have no sugar and with avocado oil.
9954 2018-02-01 01:59:07 I suppose those oil spillages on the coast are related to Sanchi's accident (unconfirmed). That place is "Takara-jima", the one of the Tokara Islands.
9955 2018-02-01 01:58:58 Burning the midmorning oil towards becoming a professional PMP.
9956 2018-02-01 01:58:29 A couple weeks ago I took my car for an oil change and the guy kept flirting with me and I told him I’m not interested that he’s too old for me & after that he left his phone number written down on a piece of paper and a rose in my car 
9957 2018-02-01 01:58:24 Bait & switch folks!
Africa dig for gold,water,oil, so lazy bypass Laws in academic markets. Imagine on a road in USA  street instead it’s ire  left sided ways of uneducated @PresidentIRL @PutinRF_Eng it always matters. Corrupt government types. @DocYilk metal thin©™®
9958 2018-02-01 01:58:23 I'm tryna get a full body oil massage. I'm sore af!
9959 2018-02-01 01:58:14 Austerity is not oil in the economic engine, as a matter of fact it is the opposite.. It seizes the engine. Nobody saves their way to prosperity, they have to invest to spur growth.
9960 2018-02-01 01:58:04 Also it says a space capsul landed in new Mexico, oil send u a pic of that after this game

9965 2018-02-01 01:57:36 @TuckerCarlson Your YOGA discussion reminded me of My enlightened use for my YoGA Mat. It is really comfortable to lay on, while under my car, changing the Oil. aaauum,

9968 2018-02-01 01:57:05 Vlad got oil islands, uranium & helped w/ a false corruption scandal from/for/w/ Clinton/DNC. Not forgetting Bundy-Hammond-Finicum either.
9969 2018-02-01 01:56:49 That was a priority. Now on to the next photo op /parade /selfie. Meanwhile, let's build more pipelines, increase oil tanker traffic and allow Nestle to buy gazillions of liter of water for pennies!
9970 2018-02-01 01:56:35 @realDonaldTrump is opening up our national monuments to drilling, our coastlines to oil exploration says @RevYearwood but we can impose our own carbon tax through resistance says @billmckibben @350
9971 2018-02-01 01:56:35 I would open the bag, take the kernels out and put it in a pot with canola oil and make it on the stove. It’ll basically be how it’s done at the movies!
9972 2018-02-01 01:56:30 Notley is such a...I don’t even know the word. Oil Bitch? Sorry we care about the environment too, but one of the provinces has to at least attempt coastal protection.
9973 2018-02-01 01:56:25 *second time using bio oil*
me: wow my night skincare routine is so thorough my face smells so damn good my husband is rly lucky to smell this
9974 2018-02-01 01:56:14 We have and are developing clean energy all at great expense that is the problem it isnt economically feasible without huge influx of Gov  if it was you would see private companies with huge capital like oil companies making huge investments. They arent they will with  tax .
9975 2018-02-01 01:56:12 Coconut oil is totally part of my beauty regimen
9976 2018-02-01 01:55:57 Will take more than an oil burner mechanic to fix this team. Good luck with your heating system repair
9977 2018-02-01 01:55:57 Could say the cost will be more widely spread among all countries to our South. Loss of remittances could be billions not there but here.
9978 2018-02-01 01:55:32 I’ve had these. No need for butter or oil to prepare. Delicious!
9979 2018-02-01 01:55:15 We need the continuous pouring of His oil upon our heads until our cup is full to overflowing.
9980 2018-02-01 01:55:12 Cyclical? It's the oil company body snatchers taking over all humans, isn't it?
9981 2018-02-01 01:54:44 well at night before i sleep , i usually shower and apply a few drops of argon oil on my face . das about it
9982 2018-02-01 01:54:40 Coconut oil the biggest scam since Vector knives telling you that you had a JOB TYPE BEAT.
9983 2018-02-01 01:54:40 I need much more detail on this oil free living.
9984 2018-02-01 01:54:33 . @BingingWBabish when you fry food how do you keep your apartment from smelling like fry oil? #Allmyclothessmelllikeagreasefire
9985 2018-02-01 01:54:25 Turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. Sometimes I’ll get oil/vinegar like a real corner store does.
9986 2018-02-01 01:54:25 Draw from giant wells oil
9987 2018-02-01 01:54:22 W purple haze ) Mixed w  drops so sweet Spit Spatter witch us batter Oil n flour white lies panther  black lives latter@lifespoems_
9988 2018-02-01 01:54:16 But the Celtics are the team I think could put together a “we’re going for it” type of trade. Danny Ainge slicker than motor oil
9989 2018-02-01 01:54:13 I like how a anonymous profile with all of 4 friends is willing to come out to defend conservatives. How much are they paying you bot?
For one thing if you followed my posts you'd know I've no love for liberal or NDP oil and dam pockets. Three parties sellout to decentralization
9990 2018-02-01 01:54:10 I've been reading @TheLastRefuge2 a bit lately, and he's of the view that Gowdy (at best) never really intended to bring corrupt politicians to justice and (at worst) benefits from the swamp. IMO he's better suited to a role outside Congress.
9991 2018-02-01 01:54:03 Igbo people truly pronounce oil as OYEL
9992 2018-02-01 01:53:47 Have oil heating company fixing our heat bc sludge clogged the burner. Maybe I should send them to the #isles next.
9993 2018-02-01 01:53:40 “I got oil” 
9994 2018-02-01 01:53:39 The skincare I didn't think I needed that I absolutely do need is cleansing oil.
9995 2018-02-01 01:53:38 Industry leaves when costs go up. Pizza in NB yesterday, chemicals in Ont today, oil companies in AB almost every month, and on and on. I guess they haven’t bought into the new economy that Davos Trudeau espoused.
9996 2018-02-01 01:53:38 i use rose essential oil as perfume and also on incense around my room :) what are your favorite oils?
9997 2018-02-01 01:53:38 Which one? There were two Kennedys killed. But I hardly think LHO counts as a Democrat? Even if you read the CT’s even then you’re talking about right wing, fascists and Nazi’s who hated JFK for how he stood up to bankers, big oil, & such.
9998 2018-02-01 01:53:29 Someone should do an oil painting of Val and Sarge and hang it in government mansion.... they are both so perfect.
9999 2018-02-01 01:53:10 Peppermint oil on your top lip, a steam room and antibiotics
10000 2018-02-01 01:53:01 Do they not ever ask what happens when the oil is gone? I mean, I know most don't care because they're selfish and will be dead but somebody has to think about future generations.
10001 2018-02-01 01:52:54 Am I the only person listening to the SOTU who heard Trump admit that his support for oil/gas/coal is about PROFITS from exports, not energy independence as he's claimed?
10002 2018-02-01 01:52:40 Would those people saying it won't work climb it themselves?
10003 2018-02-01 01:52:38 Josh just had me in here crying fuckin coconut oil theif
10004 2018-02-01 01:52:26 Please look into rick simpson oil, my heart goes out to u 
10005 2018-02-01 01:52:25 until Aramco goes ipo with much fanfair, donot think oil prices will be allowed to drop.. 64 held very well.
10006 2018-02-01 01:52:22 RFKJR “Until recently, we were borrowing a billion dollars a day mainly from nations that don’t share our values in order to import a billion dollars worth of oil … We were, in essence, funding both sides of the war in terror.”
10007 2018-02-01 01:52:08 blitz one half with some oil, and presto, lemon oil (which you can use on all kinds of things - salad dressing, mashed potatoes, drizzled atop yogurt, etc). i used my last in a couple of tagines (stews), including a veggie one that I was thrilled with.
10008 2018-02-01 01:51:33 Who in their right mind would demand “clean energy” if their bills would double? Clean energy is not where it needs to be YET. And moving to soon would only make us dependent on foreign oil. Which is probably ok with Bernie.
10009 2018-02-01 01:51:32 How is it snake oil when what he says has helped thousands of people?
10010 2018-02-01 01:51:32 You don't even buy oil from us, you do however get a lot from Female Mutilation countries.  

Here's hoping Trump destroys Ontario. 

Cheers

10013 2018-02-01 01:51:08 ....I’m an advocate in New England.  Have you tried CBD oil from medical marijuana plant??  Charlotte Figi in CO has taken the oil since age 5 and she went from 300 seizures a day to NONE the first 7 days she was given the natural drug by her parents.  It works.  Try it. 
10014 2018-02-01 01:51:02 CHANGE OF FUCKING OIL AGAIN LMFAO KILL ME
