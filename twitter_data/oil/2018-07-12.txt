4 2018-07-12 23:58:42 Think of it like anything else which you need to use in moderation, I enjoy beer, but  I should drink a bit less often. We need oil, but we need to start using less and less. It's not an all or nothing problem.

15 2018-07-12 23:56:58 Put coconut oil on them!!
16 2018-07-12 23:56:52 I left out the oil exporters, some "deficit" EMs (Turkey, Argentina , parts of Eastern Europe for example).  didn't sum up everyone -- 

but reality right now is that there is a big discrepancy.  the measured surplus of surplus countries/ regions is bigger than measured deficits

42 2018-07-12 23:55:46 In the 1970s almost every pub in England had a bar and a lounge. Never lived in Scotland so can’t comment. My point was (and is) that neither the lads in the bar, nor the slightly older more gentile punters in the lounge would have tolerated a snake oil salesman like Trump.
43 2018-07-12 23:55:38 But that doesn't determine the price! It's merely a factor in the price. Those labor costs are going to vary greatly depending on where the oil is discovered-- the ease of obtaining it. But price worldwide is the same for all of them.
44 2018-07-12 23:55:30 His vacuous *nobody predicted the price crash* was self serving nonsense...typical of the empty semantic wriggling he employs..  Saying Oil is too volatile to base a huge are of budget forecasting upon means prices will go up and down, 'unpredictably'...
45 2018-07-12 23:55:30 In fact, here are two easy examples of things where the price went up with oil prices, but didn't drop when the oil prices went down too. Cereal and soda. Staples. You'd think they'd be more affordable than they were 5 years ago. Nope.

50 2018-07-12 23:54:57 Question 1.  How many Midnight Oil songs could you belt out?  Question 2.  Is the National Anthem 'Advance Aust Fair' or 'Khe Sahn'?  Question 3.  Explain the 'ten meter protected zone rule' (trick question - no one can explain it).
51 2018-07-12 23:54:26 Big Pharma makes Big Oil look like the Boy Scouts.
52 2018-07-12 23:54:09 Oh, to be pedantic, it was ink into oil*, since that creates sufficiently different densities to create the mushrooming effect, which ink into water wouldn’t do.

54 2018-07-12 23:53:44 We'll take ours out of the fridge about 10 minutes before we eat so it softens. There's also a way of mixing it with a bit of oil (not coconut), to make it spreadable from the fridge.

61 2018-07-12 23:52:53 You do have the nicest shoulders on earth.
62 2018-07-12 23:52:53 Oil absorbents are not good internally.
63 2018-07-12 23:52:39 It's not what I say it's just the fact that in the oil industry they expect oil production to resume the long term downward trend in 2019.

Alex Salmond who had been an oil industry analyst knows this of course and knew it in 2014...
64 2018-07-12 23:52:29 “Why does she look like she’s been dip in some Crisco oil” I’m hollering I’m done w this ft call w my fam
65 2018-07-12 23:52:25 I take a low dose of Klonopin at night. I will research CBD oil. Hey! Do you find it easier to interact on SM than in person?

Hope you’re enjoying your oil fragrance ?
67 2018-07-12 23:52:23 In other news, I forgot that you’re not supposed to put oil on the pan to cook pork chops because they got their own fat and now my pork chops are swimming in grease
68 2018-07-12 23:52:17 thank you!! just egg yolks whipped a ton with very gradually added olive oil, and salt / pepper
69 2018-07-12 23:52:09 I use CBD oil for my anxiety and sensory issues. Have you started with that first before actual weed or no?
70 2018-07-12 23:52:03 Agreed. Harper's worst than GOP, though, since he wanted to turn Canada into something closer to US: still advocating it. We would end up as an US colony, valued for it's natural ressources, including oil & freshwater. A few companies & moguls would make a bundle. #cdnpoli

73 2018-07-12 23:51:38 Huh?  That makes no sense. And actually obama did send in the troops by expanding bushs war for oil in 2 countries to 7 countries. Or was it 8?
74 2018-07-12 23:51:21 Physical or emotional. Bio-oil or Lavender Oil. Other than that Chocolate and wine
75 2018-07-12 23:51:10 - Distilled water is cheapest at Giant Tiger (98¢ for 2L)
- A bottle of Dasani will do in a pinch.
- If you're stuffed up: jack up the humidity level & put 1 drop of peppermint essential oil in the mask (your sinuses will thank you!)
76 2018-07-12 23:51:05 What about all that oil you get from the middle east or doesnt that count
77 2018-07-12 23:50:54 This industry is becoming Standard Oil.
78 2018-07-12 23:50:47 Breaking: 10 minutes ago, Curiosity detects presence of oil on the red planet. 5 minutes ago, U.S. declares war on Mars.
79 2018-07-12 23:50:07 My husband is falling apart.  He was taking all types of medications that were not helping. I talked him into turmeric tea, fish oil supplements, and Epsom salt soaks 3 times a week. It helps way more than what the doctors wanted.  also, look into a tens unit, if you haven't yet.
80 2018-07-12 23:49:52 And see more than just an MOU. That $4B deal he’s talking about is probably just the zarubezhneft deal with Dana Energy for the small oil fields on the Iraqi border signed back in March...
81 2018-07-12 23:49:42 So the price of a barrel of oil is determined by the labor put into it?? 
Price is determined by a variety of factors-- labor one of them-- always dependent on context. Over all, is the market.
82 2018-07-12 23:49:31 What oil can I safely use to fry things in? Olive and coconut aren’t to be heated that high, so I’m not sure what to use.
83 2018-07-12 23:49:12 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?

86 2018-07-12 23:48:59 As someone that suffers with anxiety, how do I figure out or find out what strain of cannabis oil can help me?  Doctors here in  wanna charge me over $1k w a pile of tests before giving me a strain.

94 2018-07-12 23:48:08 if sore muscles 
homeopathic, get some peppermint oil and apply a drop or two on the afflicted area. 
OTC Aspercreme with lidocaine
Sunburn lavender oil or burn spray.
95 2018-07-12 23:47:50 I basically eat high ammounts of healthy fat (avocado, cheese, eggs, olive oil, coconut oil, salmon & fatty meat), moderate protein & eat under 20 grams of carbs a day (all my carbs come from green veggies or dairy). This shit works!!! I've been in plateau too & this helped a lot

97 2018-07-12 23:47:34 Not even regular oil ?
98 2018-07-12 23:47:19 please burn more oil its fucking cold!! but then again you could drive and drive and burn and burn till the the farting cows come home and it still wouldn't make no difference ..

104 2018-07-12 23:46:16 Pretty sure no-one alive on Earth now chose where those gas and oil deposits would form. You get energy from where you can and try to build self-sufficiency. Generation from renewable energy sources in the German electricity sector increased from 6.3% in 2000 to 30% in 2014.

106 2018-07-12 23:45:56 Agreed. But they weren’t pies. They were colored homemade play doh. My job was to take them out of the oven and cover every nook and cranny in Pam oil spray while wearing ineffectual oven mitts predictably saturated with cooking oil. All day.

111 2018-07-12 23:45:16 I don't know what his point was-it appeared he was trying to argue that the global factors that impact on *the price of oil* didn't affect *our oil* because it was *different* from all other oils...rather than the reality, which is it IS different from all other oils..so what!
112 2018-07-12 23:45:13 When I buy canola oil by accident I put it in the rain barrels to kill the mosquitoes.
113 2018-07-12 23:45:13 Shave my legs and put oil on them and all of a sudden I feel like a bad bitch
114 2018-07-12 23:45:12 How is that any different than our dependence on oil from Saudi Arabia??
115 2018-07-12 23:45:12 It’s one of *those* makeup things that claims it will help lashes grow... and I mean people use coconut oil for diy hair treatments and the lashes have good results after like 2 weeks to 1 month, so why not!! I just hate how oily my lids feel lol
116 2018-07-12 23:44:31 I've been putting peppermint oil in their trail, which staves them off briefly. maybe I'll add cinnamon!
117 2018-07-12 23:44:16 No, I did not have stock in those particular corporations. And that’s cute what you did there with oil well...
118 2018-07-12 23:44:09 I just started cooking popcorn on the stovetop - turns out way better because you can control what kind of butter/clarified butter/oil and toppings you put on

122 2018-07-12 23:43:35 I totally agree with you. They should have been on the list. We all know why they were not included = money and oil. That is not specific to Trump though. 42,43 and 44 didn’t bite that hand either. Wouldn’t it be great if he called them out as well!
123 2018-07-12 23:43:33 Trump not the one being questioned here.
124 2018-07-12 23:43:11 Found an old-timey candy store while I was exploring today and that was pretty exciting but THEN I found the bread&oil stores a few blocks down and lost my flippin mind #trulyblessed

134 2018-07-12 23:42:03 Okay. I have to get something off my chest. I’m seeing a lot of people start to shit on the plastic straw bans that are going into place all over, saying that it’s not as important as banning oil or gun control and we should be focused on those not single use plastics.
135 2018-07-12 23:41:57 once medical restrictions loosen in FL they’ll become super cheap, in cali a battery for a pen is like 15 bucks and cartridges of hash oil are maybe 20! and yeah glad to help :)
136 2018-07-12 23:41:51 Yeah, and one of the countries we get our oil from is Saudi Arabia...where 15 of the 19 hijackers in 9-11 terrorist attacks were from...our military is there and we spend buttloads of $$ in that country, so there’s that...pot calling kettle black

144 2018-07-12 23:40:40 This argument is always hilarious when you consider that under Chavez, the private sector had an higher economic growth than the oil dominated public sector. So saying that the socialists did diversified the economy is a dubious claim.
145 2018-07-12 23:40:32 You are working to destroy the planet on behalf of oil and gas companies, and you're terrible at PR, regardless of any puff piece the @nytimes may have written about you. They hired @BretStephensNYT, their credibility re: the environment ain't what it used to be.

153 2018-07-12 23:39:52 @Dodge one of your technicians screwed my car up about 1 month ago... and ever since hen I’ve had nothing but problems. First my oil filter wasn’t tightened, then my engine protector came off and now my wind deflector has come off . Tried to fix this multiple times.
154 2018-07-12 23:39:48 It would be worth the trip to Italy for the wine and food alone (seafood and pasta and olive oil, my idea of culinary heaven!) I'm especially interested in exploring the piedmont region in the north; maybe someday.

157 2018-07-12 23:39:30 I’m no expert, but where else is Germany going to get it’s refined oil and gasoline from? And if they can get it somewhere else, why aren’t they? I’m no expert, but price is my guess.
158 2018-07-12 23:39:25 I definitely have the bioré and I think ima swap my rose oil and get the tea tree. And I’ve heard good things about that toner too so I’ll be getting that

169 2018-07-12 23:37:54 Don’t ride, I’ll lotion you down or would you rather oil me? 

it’s smoother when you ride ...
170 2018-07-12 23:37:48 I'm a restaurant worker so I can change the oil in a car very very well.

While true even I'm not sure of the correlation to one another.

173 2018-07-12 23:37:37 So happy to get four artist proofs from you and have some great conversation about the art about 3-4 years ago. Really wish this was an oil painting. I remember you telling me you did it entirely digital. Such an awesome card and work of art.
174 2018-07-12 23:37:35 If you mean @caitoz thinks the Syrian "civil" war is actually a US-led coup to overthrow a(nother) democratically elected government for the benefit of global banking, the petrodollar and oil reserves, then I stand with her and I'm just as twisted.
175 2018-07-12 23:37:22 PSA: don’t be posting pictures or videos of you driving when all your dashboard lights are lit up, got the check engine, brake light, oil change etc show that shit to your mechanic not us

178 2018-07-12 23:37:15 Yeah how much of that is new oil company neighbors not cool with their visiting employees having crapass internet? I mean still I noticed last mtg the shuttles end before the poster sessions which is all LPI shenanigans.

181 2018-07-12 23:37:05 I wouldn’t either after The Oil Incident.
182 2018-07-12 23:37:00 Japan became an industrial power by getting attacked by steamships in the 19th century and being forced to engage in trade with the west. They got a big bump by building small, underpowered cars in the 1970s while the US was building big, overpowered cars when the oil crisis hit.
183 2018-07-12 23:36:49 Yeah Maybelline fit me tone 228 is my holy grail to my skintone and oil face 
184 2018-07-12 23:36:35 Sending the Trump boys in to hunt all the endangered species into extinction? Strip mining as much as possible, then setting up oil derrick everywhere else? Don't forget to poison the water and salt the earth. It's the Trump era!

187 2018-07-12 23:35:55 We've basically built our fund around displacing Excel based processes with purpose built cloud based applications. So much of the oil and gas sector still runs on custom Excel sheets.
188 2018-07-12 23:35:55 Watch Syria and the Middle East. Isaiah 17 and Ezekiel 38 are lining up for fulfillment. Israel has the spoil (gas and oil) to draw them in. The destruction of Damascus may be the catalist.

198 2018-07-12 23:33:31 I often wondered if it made his diabetes worse. I kept thinking, at the time, why are the doctors telling him to eat carbohydrate like oatmeal? Back then, he was even told to avoid nuts, and olive oil.

201 2018-07-12 23:33:09 Yet the electric car may need oil to be produced it does not use oil during its lifetime cutting out 100s of tons of oil usage per car used.

This is a bad argument. If you applied it to finance everyone would be wondering why you're advocating against saving money.
202 2018-07-12 23:33:07 Yes, before we had multiculturalism, we had sectarianism - we used to hate on each other. (Being raised Catholic, I can still remember the anti-proddy chant we kids used on the bus). (Tip: lamb tastes a billion times  better with olive oil, garlic and rosemary)

204 2018-07-12 23:32:52 I liked the Oilers until 1991, when they tried to sell fans on Damphousse being an adequate replacement to Messier and I really liked the Northstars, realizing that I didn’t have to be an Oil fan just because I had family that were.

210 2018-07-12 23:31:58 And they spent an entire day on these hearings which I certainly did not watch.  It is apparent that even the so called liberal network is in the pocket of the oil and gas companies.
211 2018-07-12 23:31:55 So what on earth prevented the past admin from its completion since it was the initiator of the project, and in spite of all the huge oil revenues?

With performance record for past 16yrs, then now from nowhere you want praises for what?

212 2018-07-12 23:31:40 @Valvoline has been unreal with their customer service. It's amazing how a simple oil change can be taken so seriously.
213 2018-07-12 23:31:29 No it’s not, Venezuela is suffering because of their oil and the price inflation’s on it which cause economic distress

220 2018-07-12 23:30:13 Have to ask...have you had the oil changed lately???
221 2018-07-12 23:30:03 If it's good enough for baby ducks covered in oil you should be fine.

224 2018-07-12 23:29:48 Yes. Oil.
225 2018-07-12 23:29:34 Did u have stock in them. Oil well.
226 2018-07-12 23:29:30 Have you ever heard of the British establishment being associated with defense of human rights & justice anywhere in the world when they have blood gains to make as soldiers of fortune? BBC twist news for British interests. Executed BIAFRA Genocide for oil wells in BIAFRALAND.
227 2018-07-12 23:29:26 Romaine lettuce, brushed with olive oil and salted.  Grill just long enough to give grill marks and heated thru.  Eat straight from grill while you are waiting on the meat.
228 2018-07-12 23:29:24 Yup. They can toss boiling oil on you!
229 2018-07-12 23:29:24 I caramelize them and flavor w red wine when I make stroganoff or I'll saute in olive oil if making bratwurst.

231 2018-07-12 23:29:06 Incorrect! Under Blair privatisation of NHS started, debt/ deficit rose. Schools closed. Look at NHS wales, they’ve suffered. Illegal wars traded arms for oil in Libya!shoukd I carry on?

233 2018-07-12 23:28:29 Indeed we can! At present we get only just 1/2 our tax and revenue back in Block Grant and only 8% of our oil money. And WE are the only nation in UK to be in the black! We are very rich in resources that other small countries, such as Iceland & even Ireland, don't have.
234 2018-07-12 23:28:12 Well it sure as he'll could be. Right now the US is producing more natural gas and oil than any other nation.
235 2018-07-12 23:27:54 AQ in Afghanistan in 1999, with seed money, & then they created themselves, funded by extortion, embezzlement, taxes, sales of oil, gas & antiquities & minor individual donations, as their funding strategy was to retain ideological independence. All info in the research  sphere.
236 2018-07-12 23:27:51 Valvoline. It’s the going rate for synthetic oil change. Apparently, my car requires it. Oof.
237 2018-07-12 23:27:44 So, he tells NATO countries to meet a promise they made years ago and to stop obtaining gas/oil from Russia.  Interesting,  not buying oil from Russia, hurts Russia, correct?

239 2018-07-12 23:26:57 あっためてあげよ
240 2018-07-12 23:26:35 So, berating Germany about Russian oil/gas was just about buying energy from the USA?  Knock me over with a feather.  Trump is a huckster who only knows about lining his own pockets.
241 2018-07-12 23:26:17 I think indiginious lands being taken for oil production and transportation is a different topic than creating alternative solutions for differently abled individuals who need straws. Please understand that comparing these two issues is harmful and not accomplishing anything.
242 2018-07-12 23:25:56 Ryan: I experienced a silos problem today. My local Dodge Dealer's marketing group sent me a coupon to come back for an oil change. When I got to the "Express Lane", I was told there was a 1.25 hour wait. 2 hours later I walked out of there. #disappointed #ECULIVE2
243 2018-07-12 23:25:49 wait what did you get besides a oil change
244 2018-07-12 23:25:42 honestly just curious, where would you prefer the oil come from?
245 2018-07-12 23:25:36 Lol... it’s back in the shop. It was leaking oil.

257 2018-07-12 23:24:17 @BuckSexton I think the Regreessive Left thinks the best way to deal with our adversaries is to enrich them— eg, China, Germany with Russia, Cuba. Do they want an oil deal with Venezuela? America First!

261 2018-07-12 23:23:48 And why do we stick to the Deal? Because we germans are more afraid of nuclear Power. We put everything we have into renewable Energy, hoping we don't rely on Gas or oil or whatever for too long.

269 2018-07-12 23:22:33 Rough day at work. My right arm is covered in oil burns, the new shop owners don’t speak English and are straight up rude to us, all fans had been removed so the fish and chips store ended up being 41c in temperature and lastly I nearly fainted due to the heat. 
270 2018-07-12 23:22:32 After trying tons of treatments to help dry, inflamed sinuses I recenly tried Pharmaceutical Sesame Oil and it has worked really well.
271 2018-07-12 23:22:31 I hate getting my oil changed  i jus want someone to pay for this for me
272 2018-07-12 23:22:29 So you’re trying to get Germany to buy oil from your Saudi Arabia buddies instead?  I would have thought you’d be happy that your Russian buddies like Putin are raking in all the bucks.  So will the Saudis give you a kickback fee?

282 2018-07-12 23:20:52 Me: I should make croutons out of the bread that's getting old

Recipe: lightly drizzle the oil over the cubes of bread

Me: *fumbles and dumps out half the bottle of oil*
....
It's probably fine
283 2018-07-12 23:20:37 Idk, as much as I think OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES is interesting, my engagement with it really doesn't stretch beyond that. Like, neat production I guess but it always feels like its keeping me at arms distance with its heaviness and surreal-ness.
284 2018-07-12 23:20:29 You aint gotta have a degree to make money. However that just depends on what you want to do. Not everybody wanna be a UPS driver, or work in the oil field, just the same as some folks dont wanna be doctors, or work for the federal government. Its all about preference.
285 2018-07-12 23:20:27 Yes of course I am a blind stooge and you are a smart well educated fellow who is not easily manipulated by a snake oil salesman.  I get it.  Cheers!
286 2018-07-12 23:20:16 More oil was just recently found, Not like that's the only resource I mentioned. There is more fresh water in Loch Ness than all of England.

Oh no! a small wait, what will we do?

Please inform me what more England has to offer?
287 2018-07-12 23:20:06 Does that mean you won't be putting castor oil on your eyelashes?
288 2018-07-12 23:19:58 Will you be going after insurance companies including workers compensation companies that rather give a opioid than to pay for alternative treatments for treating pain.

295 2018-07-12 23:18:27 Trump could not interfere in our internal business with Iran for purchasing oil
296 2018-07-12 23:18:07 thought i was independent until i went to get my oil changed and couldn’t figure out how to pop the hood for the guy
297 2018-07-12 23:18:01 I completely understand your help - Trump probably wants to come in and take over oil and the mines.
298 2018-07-12 23:17:41 "Thanks to our own guilt inducing propaganda we are looking forward to this needless financial raping of the citizens while we limit the use of their own resources and allow Saudi Arabia to own oil and abuse humans! Tee hee!"
299 2018-07-12 23:17:36 Yah, the majority of the population have no clue how oil prices work.
300 2018-07-12 23:17:34 Meanwhile Germany is getting oil from Russia while WE pay to protect them. SMH
301 2018-07-12 23:17:23 You think you are an over packer? Thing again. Currently I am considering to pack coconut oil just in case.

305 2018-07-12 23:17:09 I've been gotten into it. Podium offered for my Gray series and Tantor/RBI for my Oil Series. I don't have it in me to self-publish the rest, honestly (or to keep writing 6 books per year). Podium did a great job with promo, it seems, for that really took off.

307 2018-07-12 23:16:43 I was staggered - staggered! - to learn that "charlatan" and "mountebank" both have precise definitions with clear etymologies... and they're both specifically synonymous with "snake oil salesman".
308 2018-07-12 23:16:39 I anoint you with oil warmed by the holy Flame. All is well.
309 2018-07-12 23:16:39 Let's play Trump Mad Libs:

321 2018-07-12 23:14:46 I’m going with Reagan, because he and his Kitchen Cabinet were the inception of great evil in America.

The rest, we can handcuff together, give them picks and shovels, and put them in Texas working the oil lines.
322 2018-07-12 23:14:41 about to play a prank on Saika involving oil. wonder how it'll go.
323 2018-07-12 23:14:35 What resources? Oil? Already sold. They would only pipe in enough to service Scottish consumers and move the rest to Yorkshire.

As to the EU, it wouldn't be immediate and while there is "nothing stopping it" that's not a guarantee of acceptance
324 2018-07-12 23:14:33 (Bonus question: Is it a good idea to put ‘fossil fuel-producing corporations,’ like fracking wells, oil rigs and garbage incinerators in economically depressed regions of the country, to stimulate economic growth and create jobs for minorities?)
325 2018-07-12 23:14:13 Yeah, just go to any pharmacy and you should find it. Dip a cotton bud or cotton wool in the oil then hold it between your teeth, including the one that hurts.
326 2018-07-12 23:14:01 Well said
We need oil for now
Maybe there is some magic pixie dust or unicorn  stuff but until it's found....

WE NEED OIL TO SURVIVE

Lets use ours instead of the same stuff from countries that seek to be not very nice

331 2018-07-12 23:13:08 It's great that we're banning plastic straws, but now can we consider oil pipelines a straw and ban them?
332 2018-07-12 23:13:03 Every religion can claim “ Mine’s the only one with ...” (fill in the blank).  Most other religions don’t require a savior.  Christianity invents a disease (sin) and then promises a cure.  Snake oil salesmen use the same sort of con.

339 2018-07-12 23:12:33 Except it’s not. Net import of 2,400,000 barrels a day. Or 876,000,000 a year. The rollback of energy efficient vehicles and other environmental measure will increase demand and, with it, the need to continue to be a net oil importer.
340 2018-07-12 23:12:09 Add some oil. Then America will show up!

Curse you, irritants!
355 2018-07-12 23:10:32 I finally took my car to get an oil change
356 2018-07-12 23:10:32 Got that good oil change I did some adulting today!
357 2018-07-12 23:10:31 Is that oil or a very viscous mud? Still, what do you expect from a dog that loves water?

362 2018-07-12 23:09:41 Apparently if you read Postmedia the Alberta NDP controls the world price of oil. It because of them oil companies were laying off not the drop in oil prices.
363 2018-07-12 23:09:30 He laughed, bending to kiss her cheek before getting up to clean away the oil that he had been using for her. 

“Don’t get too comfortable. After all, we still have to go out later today after all.” 

As Dmitry cleaned up, Pooka appeared from-
364 2018-07-12 23:09:15 It's basic advertising--instill insecurity, fear, etc. and then you can sell the "solution" to that problem. If people are content, then there's nothing to buy. And Trump is ALWAYS selling (it's snake oil, but he's selling it hard).
365 2018-07-12 23:09:02 Probably was a bad idea opening my essential oil with my mouth cause all I can taste is fresh cotton fragrance
366 2018-07-12 23:08:59 Germany is importing oil from Russia, but it is a small fraction of energy consumption in Germany and idk that they’re making a huge difference w/ Russia’s military budget/ spending.
367 2018-07-12 23:08:55 Holy shit i thought today was Friday im gonna go ahead and put this oil down for a few. Anyways, point stands you guys kick ass
368 2018-07-12 23:08:53 Can't wait to watch it
369 2018-07-12 23:08:44 The oil made London and saved Britain(England).If only that was in Scotland's hands.Only country that has oil but poor.
370 2018-07-12 23:08:31 I fucking love getting an oil change, car be feeling all smooth and new 
371 2018-07-12 23:08:22 You don’t get it. His words remind me of a black friend in college told me:he would rather deal with Southern bigots than Northern liberals because he knew where the bigots stood. Where does NATO stand?  Filling Putin’s coffers from oil & gas which he doesn’t use for his people.
372 2018-07-12 23:08:21 No, dude probably didnt change his oil enough lol
373 2018-07-12 23:08:20 I only use the egg and the stand. The oil is cool just I don’t use it. I use lube.
374 2018-07-12 23:08:05 we will find out if we leave ----who they gonan sell all that excess we aint gonna buy from the EU in return ??

Russia ? do a sly deal like they have with the gas and oil ---massive sanctions on Russia,why wouldnt they sell them food on the sly ?
375 2018-07-12 23:07:59 I don’t understand how this is as apocalyptic as you’re making it sound because the US does the same damn thing. The United States imports oil from Russia even though the USA is also a member of NATO.
376 2018-07-12 23:07:56 ㅇ아니 내가 알아서 할게..
377 2018-07-12 23:07:23 I would advise people when buying purchases to concentrate more on essentials and to buy in bulk if their budgets allow. With oil prices higher, interest rates a'rising and trade wars going on, consumers will soon feel the results of higher costs by companies who will pass it on.
378 2018-07-12 23:07:08 I need to go get my gender oil change on one of the genders I own.

394 2018-07-12 23:04:03 Would be cheaper to buy oil and do it yourself lol!
395 2018-07-12 23:04:01 Good luck getting cash from Zinke, I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to sell it to an oil company
396 2018-07-12 23:03:55 Fresh bluefin tuna is listed as having the highest omega-3 content, with 1.504g of DHA and EPA in every 100g. Light tuna canned in oil has the lowest, at just 0.128g. White tuna canned in water is a better choice, at .862g per 100g of fish.
397 2018-07-12 23:03:44 It will subside...but the number of damaged and sterile young people sucked into believing trans is the magic wand diagnosis for all ills will be shown to have been very misinformed by those who should have known better.shame on stonewall mermaids gires etc.purveyors of snake oil
398 2018-07-12 23:03:42 depends on whether you mean cheese made in america, or actual "american cheese"
like with wine and olive oil, there are plenty of good cheesemakers in the united states
quote unquote "american cheese" however is quite bad
399 2018-07-12 23:03:37 Pres Trump is standing up for the USA, not on an apology tour . Yes the NATO members owe us money . The NATO members should not be buying Oil from Russia , and then short changing the USA.
400 2018-07-12 23:02:55 ...then mixture would boil and the red oil woild splatter over the hot stove... there was lots of spices too... some smelt nice, but most in combination with the smell of different food groups made my eyes tear. Perhaps my flavorless kikuyu system was jolted into a shock...

402 2018-07-12 23:02:44 Nothing like a fresh oil change and cold ac.
403 2018-07-12 23:02:42 I hate the slow cooker recipes that are all "here's a lasagna but replace the vaguely good ingredients with more cheese and more oil, fuck your cholesterol"
404 2018-07-12 23:02:40 The heavy use of oil and gas has an impact on the ancestral lands of every human.
405 2018-07-12 23:02:40 We can't get over in the states because @AnaKicks is the only member of the Hellcat Spangled Death Squad who is American and she thinks the president murdered his own citizens so he could go to war for oil.

414 2018-07-12 23:01:20 It is very complicated and contradictory. I wonder about a parallel timeline in which Goff didn't ban them, the gig went ahead and only about 100 Whale Oil saddos and racist South Africans showed up.

Person #2: WTF? These loos aren't filled with oil!
417 2018-07-12 23:00:40 NATO was formed at a time when most of European was in ruins, we had to take the largest role. 2. Europe imports huge % of Middle East oil. Our soldiers are dying to protect their interest. Time for Europe to pay up or spill their kids blood. Oh Europe created Israel/Pal
418 2018-07-12 23:00:38 If Trump ditches NATO America will have to fight all their oil wars on their own from now on. Which is a good thing. Also he'll have to take back all his fucking nukes. Again another good thing. #BBCTW

440 2018-07-12 22:58:53 And he would bring this gunia of dried fish into our communal kitchen, heat up a sufuria of what I think was Palm oil, dio fry the base ingredients into that so onions and the like... boil chicken  toss that in there, as well as meat and now the dried fish(es)...
441 2018-07-12 22:58:38 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
442 2018-07-12 22:58:37 The managers sometimes going overboard trying to prevent nct being themselves, but netizens can be more meaner by twisting their words and action. (plus the media will be the one who put oil on the fire )
443 2018-07-12 22:58:35 Random, but rosehip oil....why didn’t I start using sooner lmao
444 2018-07-12 22:58:22 Let me rub this peppermint oil on my temples and see

446 2018-07-12 22:58:13 My first f1 experience the 1979 Monaco Grand Prix. I can still smell the oil and the rubber, but the most amazing memory is the #12 Ferrari 312 T4 4-wheel drifting Tabac when everybody else lifted. Everybody trackside knew that they were watching something special!

448 2018-07-12 22:57:53 Hmm i changed my brush setting from like 50% blending to 20% and i kinda like it better like this??? and it makes much more sense to me since using actual acrylics/oil, i never blended much either???
449 2018-07-12 22:57:41 Because they say oil comes from dinosaurs fossils
450 2018-07-12 22:57:40 I need my car washed

451 2018-07-12 22:57:29 “Alberta should focus on research-led innovation, particularly in AI as well as on retraining its talent pool of oil and gas engineers as part of its diversification strategy”, says @PanacheVC's @PatrickLor. #Alberta #Ableg #AbPoli #AI #Diversification #FutureEconomyCanada
452 2018-07-12 22:57:23 I get that plastic straws aren’t the biggest problem on earth but we should celebrate people doing good things that are in their power. Starbucks doesnt have the power to ban oil pipelines or assault rifles. They do have the power to reduce plastic and they did!
453 2018-07-12 22:57:14 You pretty happy with it? I have been happy with their cameras but did see that "oil painting" effect on low-light pics with 5. I saw they just patched that for 5 and 6 though.
454 2018-07-12 22:57:13 The nomination process for SCOTUS has become a cynical hunt for pedigree extremism.  As long as it carries an Ivy League label, it must be pure, good and white. The public will swallow snake oil if the label is right.  Never mind our justice and rights depend on true balance.
455 2018-07-12 22:56:51 Zoos Victoria has dumped Nestle products from its kiosks and food carts after the company was suspended from an international organisation that promotes the sustainable use of palm oil.

457 2018-07-12 22:56:36 @seanhannity LITERALLY makes stuff up. How is he still a thing? Fear of reprisal from the highest FBI levels and a sense of duty and ethics are what kept Strzok from protecting Clinton. Hannity is a  oil salesman.
458 2018-07-12 22:56:17 Dunno why I convince myself I can tan and use oil, burnt to fuck 
459 2018-07-12 22:56:08 I find it funny that people in the UK are making a big stink over Trump visiting, but there were barely any protests over the visits of Xi Jinping, or of any figure from Saudi "The Only Reason You're Allied Us is 'Cuz of Our Oil" Arabia.
460 2018-07-12 22:56:08 @realDonaldTrump As the Treasury Secretary said, "No one has the right to buy oil from Iran, this year, all countries should stop oil imports from Iran, if they do not, they will face tumultuous sanctions, plus tariffs.
461 2018-07-12 22:56:00 I actually use oil while still a little wet like damp. soaks into the skin & have me feeling golden

464 2018-07-12 22:55:39 So I'm watching this new animated White Fang movie on Netflix, and I want to marry the art style

The way they modeled and painted the fur looks like oil paintings and the paws are so good and the eyes are so intense I'm just IN LOVE
465 2018-07-12 22:55:36 Ya! You can get a jar of coconut oil. You could use it for your hair and/or removing your makeup (which is what I use it for). You can keep it on as long as you want. You can also sleep with it in but you’d have to put a shower cap over it so it won’t get on your pillow.
466 2018-07-12 22:55:05 I want to try the concealer. The foundation has coconut oil in it, so I know it’ll have me looking an oily mess. So it’s a NOPE for me.
467 2018-07-12 22:55:05 Yeah it will just not as much as injecting chili oil. You should try that, it's a wicked high mate. I get high off banana skins all the time. Sometimes I sniff me kob after not having washed and that gets me high as a kite.

472 2018-07-12 22:54:27 This is the real collusion. A former German Chancellor is now chairman of the oil company own by Russia and the country is giving billions to the Russians for oil while they underpay their obligations to NATO

475 2018-07-12 22:53:55 I don’t think you are using facts.  Rachel Notley has stood behind the oil and gas sector in Alberta and she has done everything in her power to get the pipeline approved.  I don’t like this kind of rhetoric.
476 2018-07-12 22:53:55 おめでとーございます
477 2018-07-12 22:53:50 I would counter with a question: How does it seem productive to keep any of what got us here? After so many Dems have sided with rich donors from the private sector to help dismantle public education (Charters), environmental protections (Oil pipelines), etc We need an awakening.

502 2018-07-12 22:50:29 Are those the things you can use to wipe oil off of your oily skin on the go? Cuz if so, I couldn't agree more! Only discovered recently, was resorting to alcohol swabs or handwipes before!
503 2018-07-12 22:50:14 yall ever cook with extra virgin olive oil to flex on paula deen
504 2018-07-12 22:50:13 Visited VB today and ate Long John Silver's on the way back (one of those 'childhood favorite' things I almost always do when I'm here).  Based on the amount of fat and oil I've ingested today I will now be fasting for the next week and a half 
505 2018-07-12 22:50:03 Could've changed my oil yesterday when it wasn't 30,725 degrees out. 
506 2018-07-12 22:50:02 I’ve been dying and bleaching my hair for years and it’s still in a decent condition. Washing it 1-2 times a week and doing a coconut oil mask every week helps a lot and if you stop using heated hair tools on it it’ll help even more. 
507 2018-07-12 22:49:55 Some oil does cost more for certain cars I just can’t believe it was that much there! It’s ladies day too! Should’ve been cheaper! lol
508 2018-07-12 22:49:52 Foggy Bottom fantasy. With #oil.

510 2018-07-12 22:49:26 It would be a really stupid move to buy his snake oil. As soon as he cuts Britain away from the pack...boom! Thomson's gazelle time.
511 2018-07-12 22:49:19 Ha! Not sure about linseed, got teak oil (whatever that is!) for some furniture, and a variety of oils for cooking... Not sure about beeswax off hand though 
512 2018-07-12 22:49:13 Yeah, if we had an actual democracy, we would be well on the way to transitioning to 100% clean energy. That's what the majority wants.

The problem is we have governments that are captured by wealthy oil & gas interests which overrule the will of the people.

i dont need to see that.

610 2018-07-12 22:37:09 Sounds a bit like snake oil to me. White LEDs use a blue LED to excite a phosphor to provide the green and red components of 'white' light. Therefore there is a big blue component to the light, which is the bit that wakes you up (or keeps you awake)
611 2018-07-12 22:37:00 The leaking tank, though worrisome, shows an appropriate design of protective features. No oil left trans mountain property  and had a negative impact on natural ecosystems.
612 2018-07-12 22:36:56 Umm yeah about oil companies. They've all admitted to their part in climate change. All of them. What they don't want is to be sued over it. You might want to check what ExxonMobil did today concerning ALEC.

614 2018-07-12 22:36:43 Interesting. I bought a yuzu-mint beard oil from Botanical Skinworks - only seen them on Amazon, but they're nice, less overkill in the "manly" scents from other brands, though the peppermint is a bit strong here. Still like it, but was hoping more yuzu.

628 2018-07-12 22:35:21 The Ayatollahs need a reality check. 1st...the Strait is not the relevance it once was as the US - & others - are closing in on oil independence &/or interdependence without Iran or OPEC. 2nd...that would give every western neocon - & Israel - an excuse for a full frontal assault

644 2018-07-12 22:33:30 Even low wage workers are being put out of jobs by automation. It’s why politicians are being disingenuous when they promise to bring back manufacturing to US 20th Century skilled workers. Even coal, oil & agriculture are not exempt from job loss #LeisureEconomyMyAss
645 2018-07-12 22:33:24 CBD oil came in today. Gave it an early try so I know how it affects me. Slight drowsiness. Pain is reduced, but not gone. Much more effective than acetaminophen. Pricy though. I'll need time to decide if the cost/benefit adds up.

658 2018-07-12 22:31:57 Trump and his "TRIP" is about securing OIL/LNG from US exports. Forget the Fracking, poisoning of Our water, earthquakes etc. They have Corporate Hospitals to assist you in the Cancers. Hock your home too so you can eek out 2 more years of pain sever before you finally die.
659 2018-07-12 22:31:50 No, I'm sorry but you're flat wrong. Ethical medical treatment is diagnosing and treating real disorders - not pseudoscience. Sex addiction treatment is snake oil. And sex is not addictive. try again

662 2018-07-12 22:31:33 If he honestly thinks the price of gas will go down he's never looked at a gas pump. He lowers taxes, Big oil raises the cost, hence he just handed big oil a nice increase in profits while decimating the province.

671 2018-07-12 22:29:41 I'm kind of on the fence about the location, but if you cook anything with oil it will ruin anything directly above the stove so that wouldn't be a good spot for anything of value.
672 2018-07-12 22:29:37 If we're all patient the oil companies will cover Alberta with toxic black sludge and we won't have to accommodate the troglodytes any more.

700 2018-07-12 22:24:44 Is that as illogical as US buying oil from dictator-run Venezuela or from Saudi Arabia, an Arab country hostile to Israel? Or is it more akin to various Trump companies manufacturing and importing products from China? Are any of those items are on new China tariff list? Doubt it.

710 2018-07-12 22:23:46 oil will still cost what it costs to extract and refine - with less consumption the cost per unit goes up ...
711 2018-07-12 22:23:37 Should an oil change take an hour and a half?
712 2018-07-12 22:23:36 I was reading into it. It’s more like an oil that relaxes the vag & helps with intensifying orgasms.  Ayyyy a little help never hurts

727 2018-07-12 22:21:33 I dont use apple or cucumber-- bloat & sugar problems, I add 1/4 tsp of coconut oil.
728 2018-07-12 22:21:29 Pero umasa parin ako HAHAHAHA yung feeling na kailangan kong lumusob sa ulan para lang makabili ng oil pastel

730 2018-07-12 22:21:19 Well, I am trusting my friends who work in Cairo Airport and they said it is far from the airport. 
The explosion because of 2 oil tanks in the petrochemical factory. That is all.
731 2018-07-12 22:21:17 You’ll still see increased production form other basins, but it’ll be much subdued relative to the growth we’ve seen out of the Permian in last year or so.  I suspect we’ll be screaming for more oil by this time next year when Permian takeaway capacity starts to increase.
732 2018-07-12 22:21:09 Arghh! All you oily pipewiners. Did ya know that the discovery of oil killed the whaling industry?Yar is saving Moby eating dem twizzlers!
733 2018-07-12 22:21:02 Those brief moment of respite from the news when your biggest concern is your coconut oil being in a fully liquid state
734 2018-07-12 22:21:01 Neva.. Our Petrol is so high due to the huge % tax we pay on it.. it is not Usd and oil cost.. oil has been Much Higher.. and R much lower before.. Getting tricked here.  Last bit people money must go..
735 2018-07-12 22:20:50 Ironically, people pray for cake. Then when God gives them butter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen
736 2018-07-12 22:20:28 They remit the tax of B2B sales as tax only met for point of sale ... but let Sales B2B purchases dried cannabis then its turned to oil hard to argue that’s not a point of sale also...
737 2018-07-12 22:20:22 Because he is not taking steps towards a better world, he has withdrawn from Paris agreement, he is increasing military budget by reducing budget of nasa, he is increasing production & crude oil use etc. which will make america powerful but take humans towards extinction.
738 2018-07-12 22:20:21 Just spilled oil all over me
739 2018-07-12 22:20:06 I need to get a oil change ASAP tomorrow
740 2018-07-12 22:19:40 < Well, /good/. If he was out there he would get a good oil Darcy punch in the face, best case scenario 

In the lab, both women were greeted by the nearly dead Coulson. Another face that Darcy would love to punch, since that was the one who >
741 2018-07-12 22:19:39 I swear it’s like alll company’s want to do is over price products, whether it’s an Apple iPhone or hair products  
I literally just spent $40 for shampoo, conditioner and hair oil....it’s fucking ridiculous! 3 items
742 2018-07-12 22:19:38 I take him serious because of his involvement with the likes of JP Morgan, oil companies, arms suppliers, & the financial gains he and his family / friends stand to make by the policies he can introduce and support. He was bailed out by the managing director of N.M Rothschild.
743 2018-07-12 22:19:30 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
744 2018-07-12 22:19:20 Make a foil bowl, drizzle some garlic olive oil over it and put in on the cool side of the grill with some wood chips going. Give a couple tosses til they soften a bit (don't turn them to mush!), add a couple pats of butter to melt into them, sprinkle with sea salt.
745 2018-07-12 22:19:06 Tapos hinintay ko pa yung oil pastel mo kung dadating
746 2018-07-12 22:19:04 anyway i’m just really annoyed about the no oil part
747 2018-07-12 22:19:04 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
748 2018-07-12 22:18:50 You've been working in the car industry uh! Oil baby much? crying and asking for money. That's great. You get out and help, don't beg, you should be billionaire right? With all those years working?
749 2018-07-12 22:18:43 And get your car’s oil changed while you wait
750 2018-07-12 22:18:37 Well, actually we only get the environmental damage, and the oil gets exported. Canada gets the profits. So, Germany is smarter than Trump.
751 2018-07-12 22:18:15 Keeping secrets give me guilt diarrhea.
752 2018-07-12 22:17:44 I bet that's what most USA Citizens have been saying since that Moron @realDonaldTrump was voted in by Russia sorry some very sad USA citizens who in the old days would buy snake oil now they bought the snake oil salesman !! #JustSaying
753 2018-07-12 22:17:39 Absolutely--I hope there can be some creative thinking now in terms of reducing public sector expenditure, easing pain w/ extra oil $$, a glide path towards a more sustainable state, rather than going through the familiar MENA cycle of cut, protest, reverse cut, cut again...
754 2018-07-12 22:17:38 Not entirely true. Most airlines hedged oil prices when they were high, and hardly saw any benefits of the last few years of low prices. Of course, once they were getting away with the surcharge, no reason to stop it.
755 2018-07-12 22:17:18 I'm so mad over this though. . . That Ghanaian president and these Arabs better do the damn things. Angeke phela. And when is that Oil Refinery yako Nigeria coming into service? The one ya Dangote
756 2018-07-12 22:17:16 Some oil
757 2018-07-12 22:17:13 "Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 
surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever".…

758 2018-07-12 22:17:07 Chef McElroy cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with cheese.
759 2018-07-12 22:17:02 I'm getting CBD oil for my cat in hopes she's not a complete twat to everyone she's around . Wish us luck . 
760 2018-07-12 22:16:58 Is...the coffee gagging on the lemon oil?
761 2018-07-12 22:16:54 Mobile in rockfalls they told me I had to get a special oil but I think they just thought I was a dumb blonde! I mean I am but 
762 2018-07-12 22:16:27 is that sweat and oil or... just an unfortunate design choice?
763 2018-07-12 22:16:27 ight fuck you the ingredients are literally dried bananas and coconut oil gomd

766 2018-07-12 22:16:13 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
767 2018-07-12 22:16:13 (´∇｀)
768 2018-07-12 22:16:05 8/ Oh, Lucas' wife is also a jewel:
"Lucas’ wife, Charlotte, who co-founded Lucas Oil, came under fire in 2014 for a Facebook post that criticized Muslims and atheists. 'I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!' she wrote, according to news reports at the time.'"
769 2018-07-12 22:16:03 Any country can buy their own oil supply from where ever they darn well please and you have no say in it. The last place I would want to buy anything is from the US. We're boycotting as much as we can of made in the usa. I'll buy from anywhere else before I'll buy US products.
770 2018-07-12 22:15:57 You think Nigeria economy got bad in 3years? You are a learner. Ask your unless party what they did with crude oil revenue in 16year. They are the locusts, cankerworms that eat the harvest of this nation Nigeria.

777 2018-07-12 22:15:26 From 2007 to 2016, annual U.S. oil production increased by 75%, while natural gas production increased by 39%. Thanks to fracking, the notion of “peak oil” has been effectively debunked. @EnergyInDepth
778 2018-07-12 22:15:21 Sorry Doug, I doubt ND is ever going to be able to live down the shame and stigma of being deeply addicted to Oil Revenue and the massive damage that it is causing to the soul and the water of your, once beautiful, state.

782 2018-07-12 22:15:07 Why haven’t people been introduced to seasonings outside of salt oil and black pepper?
783 2018-07-12 22:14:54 And to the people saying that Russians are Europeans that Germany should get along with, that's the point. Why does NATO exist if Europe wants to be friends with Russia and import Russian oil and gas? Clearly they aren't the same threat as the Soviet Bloc was.
784 2018-07-12 22:14:40 ManCity have lost 60% Of their Twitter followers rn, Oil money can't buy you active fans
785 2018-07-12 22:14:38 There isn't enough to feed the country... PetroSa has em with Sasol but if I remember correctly it's not crude oil. So all the by products are there like bo paraffin but petrol isn't enough to do much.

 Opec still dictates the price

789 2018-07-12 22:13:28 Dis oil change is taking forevaaaa
790 2018-07-12 22:13:22 Iceland has geothermal energy so doesn't need much oil or gas and has a population of almost nothing, Ireland has 300m people claiming ancestry and they're all stupid enough to buy anything with a tricolour on it and it has better agriculture too
791 2018-07-12 22:12:58 2. The US has a long history of corporate take over of other countries, rich in resources. Think Dole, in Latin America. Canada with their oil and gas, water and hydroelectric power. The US makes unreasonable demands. When they are not met, they take the ball home.

797 2018-07-12 22:12:18 Maybe it's time the United States used its military to protect whale oil reserves like we do petroleum oil reserves.
798 2018-07-12 22:12:16 Time for my oil change & Richards have no available appts Saturday

809 2018-07-12 22:11:26 If the "right path" involves drone striking innocent children in hospitals and toppling foreign governments for oil and other natural resources I want no part of it.
810 2018-07-12 22:11:25 No evidence. I'm just thinking outside the box. I do know that before the age of using OIL to create everything  (polyester etc) we wear, the pkg things come in, the sheets we sleep on...

We are now a net EXPORTER of oil! 

How the hell do you look at that and think that Trump is beholden to Russia?
815 2018-07-12 22:11:09 Things were so much simpler when americans were just dumping tea into the ocean and not crude oil and garbage.
816 2018-07-12 22:11:08 After reading the studies (fully) about JBO, I have determined that it is within my risk profile to use rope with it based on how the studies were done and their results. My rope processing process is: buy high quality rope, add a bit of jojoba oil, tie.

819 2018-07-12 22:10:57 Coal & All fossil fuel extraction is the most absurd idea ever.

The void left after Oil, Gas, Coal is extracted in such quantities. Must in any science be filled or collapse in on itself.
Agriculture is great over deep Fossil fuel. Rotting Vegetation

853 2018-07-12 22:07:48 People like to think keto means just eating pork rinds and steak and I'm pretty sure that's why ppl get sick.

The oil would be piped to Yorkshire because Scotland doesn't have enough demand and they would lose the lions share of the tax
867 2018-07-12 22:05:50 6/ ..."David Turnbull, the campaigns director at anti-fossil-fuels group Oil Change USA, worried that Trump's Cabinet could be full of people with ties to the oil industry" such as "Harold Hamm, the CEO of Oklahoma oil company Continental Resources" (potential Energy Secretary).
868 2018-07-12 22:05:49 valvoline tried to charge me $97 for an oil change....... what????
869 2018-07-12 22:05:38 so apparently my cat has anxiety and ocd and needs CBD oil to calm down and i'm like #mood
870 2018-07-12 22:05:37 I would love to come with you on a field trip, I live in Colorado please let me know when you are having one and we can have a great civil and reality based conversation on the real world advantages that oil & gas gives us (like the cars we'd be taking for example).
871 2018-07-12 22:05:27 Just can't do it. She's a DINO who votes with the Repubs far too often, and she takes big oil money. We really need Angelica Earl!
872 2018-07-12 22:05:24 Flying with Hay Fever? Get clear for take off with Breaze Vapour Oil. Poor air quality and cabin pressure on planes can leave you stuffy, bunged up and uncomfortable. Small enough to carry through security, breathe easier, holiday happy. Don't leave the country without it!
873 2018-07-12 22:05:03 @OilPrice says America's "#oil and #gas rig count now stands at 1,060—up 144 from this time last year."
874 2018-07-12 22:05:01 At least CBD is now more generally known as cannabinoid oil than childhood bipolar disorder. #alternativemedicine #NaturalHealing #overdiagnosis #holistichealth
875 2018-07-12 22:04:29 Add drops to the coconut oil and baking soda for a scent.  But the oils itself have their benefits.
876 2018-07-12 22:04:24 But 23% are not fix, limited by pipeline constraints (without nordstrm), got it? Up to 20% are coal, which can be substituted with gas, got it? And Oil, 13% already + 8% gas = 20%. So a possible market share of Russia is now 20% und could, depending on gas prices up to 40%.

881 2018-07-12 22:03:49 Thought I was getting liver spots/ Age spots on my arm from stress or the sun. 

I saw 3 brown spots just appear. 

Turns out they were just burns from when I through that steak in the oil the other night 

My cooking style has zero chill
882 2018-07-12 22:03:46 Reports of gas/oil tank explosions
883 2018-07-12 22:03:24 Ok for sure I’m going to get an oil change then I’ll be on
884 2018-07-12 22:03:21 Yeah, some of us have jobs that actually matter more than this. 
Back to your feckless bilge. "Export from"? Gonna give that one to you as a stupid mistake.
The rest? No pass, genius. That's where the oil is shipped from, not its origin. 
Sorry if that doesn't fit your narrative.
885 2018-07-12 22:03:15 @tara_homsey I have terrible anxiety. Have you ever tried CBD oil? Yes it's legal lol (incase you thought not) I take it every day now and it really helps. Let me know if you have any questions or check out this page
886 2018-07-12 22:03:03 The only thing Russia has going for it is there natural gas and oil and Trump told these countries not to purchase that commodity from Russia. You're so full of s*** and you know it.
887 2018-07-12 22:02:58 And our whisky, and our oil, and our tourism, and we won't have to pay for trident or the houses of Parliament or the house of lords or any other vanity projects.
888 2018-07-12 22:02:56 Anything involving coconut oil I automatically love 
889 2018-07-12 22:02:56 Crude Oil bears out in full force looking for vindication after being so wrong for so long. Talking about production numbers for the past 3 years hasn't worked so they have now switched talking points and are claiming weak demand. Keep throwing darts, one will eventually stick.
890 2018-07-12 22:02:13 Certain oils are designed for different problems!!! Like I heard mint or tea tree oil are good for headaches!

892 2018-07-12 22:02:05 good luck hope it works out!  if you use the top rated oil (something gro) let me know if it works, they arent allowed to ship to california 
893 2018-07-12 22:02:01 It's an herb and can be grown yourself. Yep your medicine cabinet should be your back yard garden not a bunch of snake oil bottles that give more symptoms than they prevent. If everyone grew their own it would become the equivalent of any other herb + the hemp products benefit.
894 2018-07-12 22:01:46 I'm okay with the salt, but oil???
895 2018-07-12 22:01:40 I think we totally misread our horoscope earlier. Looking at it again I think we're supposed to use the oil to fry the turkey and then wrestle over the wishbone to wish for a better horoscope.
896 2018-07-12 22:01:36 Takes the UK? I remember he wanted to take the oil in Iraq, is this the same thing?
897 2018-07-12 22:01:29 I recently tried can oil for unbearable back pain. It numbed it for approx 30 mins, and I do not use it at all before trying. I could see for serious medical problems, but nothing else!
898 2018-07-12 22:01:14 I am slowing learning more about all things oil & oil geopolitics. TY.
899 2018-07-12 22:01:11 Mom told us Dad had people booked for 5:30, 6:30 and 7 up in his garage and like I just think it’s funny cause like what about that oil change I told him I was almost due for oh I don’t know 4 months ago? Huh DADDD? Am I going to have to call and book an appointment, or?
900 2018-07-12 22:01:10 Hold their feet to the fire. Germany has been selling pipes for oil/gas pipelines to Russia for many years. Not smart. MAGA
901 2018-07-12 22:01:09 Talking about the snake oil you're trying to sell.
902 2018-07-12 22:01:02 Offshore oil reserves but hopefully we get more from em like renewable energy technologies.

   I hope its not more shopping malls.
903 2018-07-12 22:00:59 You are hilarious. Trump has appointed career oil & coal lobbyists to head the EPA. This is a fact, and is a blatant display of corruption.
904 2018-07-12 22:00:55 Are you still living in the ‘80’s, or 2001 for that matter?  The US is now around 85-90% energy independent and on track to be a net exporter of oil and gas within 5 years.  Seems like smart policy to not be dependent on foreign/non-ally energy supplies.
905 2018-07-12 22:00:54 Thankyou!! It’s data science for permasense (they makes sensors for oil pipes etc to detect the rate of corrosion) :p seems really interesting!
906 2018-07-12 22:00:52 @NNPCgroup How much do you pay for leaking some group of people vandalizing government oil pipeline ?? Let's talk business
907 2018-07-12 22:00:51 Garlic oil is a great alternative to garlic and we use spring onion ends in our house....you may be intolerant to these too though. Wishing you  luck! 
908 2018-07-12 22:00:43 Trump will not be happy, oh boy
909 2018-07-12 22:00:40 i think i tried that for the mealy bugs but will try for the soil gnats. i cant dry out the soil on my tomatoes but i just neem oil mix consistently and it semi works.  gardening is hard and i just do potted plants in a balcony too lol
910 2018-07-12 22:00:34 You can always add more when you’re cooking. That goes for cooking oil, salt, sugar, or any other ingredient. Start with less and add as needed! #health
911 2018-07-12 22:00:33 How do you nicely say "I can already tell I'm getting a migraine from my current nausea and your overwhelming smell of patchouli oil is going to make me hurl please move" to someone?
912 2018-07-12 22:00:30 Salmon is good for you ya,just make sure there isn’t too much added to it before it’s smoked,mushrooms should be grand even if cooked in a little bit of olive or rapeseed oil

919 2018-07-12 21:59:25 Yeah, Canola Oil will do that...

"varying from 8.3% to 80% fat, 10% to 80% carbohydrate, 5% to 30% protein, and 5% to 30% sucrose" - ok so what were the ratios of the fattening diet?

"increased..dopamine and opioid signaling pathways" - not in humans? 
920 2018-07-12 21:59:22 you remember that castrol oil special he once did years ago where they basically scientically tested his body?! that nigga can leap!! his thighs are the size of my torso... he's also tall  so there's that

927 2018-07-12 21:58:26 It depends. It’s totally different if you use canola oil, olive oil, or animal fat.
928 2018-07-12 21:58:18 Stockings - Leather skirt and oil
929 2018-07-12 21:58:12 Is it just me, or does it not make any sense that someone on the board of health for Oklahoma only has experience in oil. He voted to oppose banning smokeables. But still, how did he got on in the first place if he’s not a doctor?
930 2018-07-12 21:58:10 Plenty oil too
931 2018-07-12 21:58:04 Parafina + Coconut Oil =

933 2018-07-12 21:57:56 RIGHT!
She should testify, 
     ...like you did!
And she should tell the truth,

942 2018-07-12 21:56:37 I should send you some lemon oil, its amazing it'll clean anything. I've seen it take paint off stuff and melt plastic
943 2018-07-12 21:56:08 As I get in my car after buying oil, the oil change light comes on 
944 2018-07-12 21:55:59 Well, I don't know about that. But for the last few months the only product I use is a little jojoba oil after every shower.
945 2018-07-12 21:55:53 Yea, that's why you use Avocado Oil for high heat cooking
946 2018-07-12 21:55:51 check the oil most def...changing it nawww I can do everything else 
947 2018-07-12 21:55:46 Can't wait to see who wins! Let's see what's going to inspire "Oil Tot" for the upcoming "Let's Play"!
948 2018-07-12 21:55:41 Of course they were. @POTUS44 had no objections to killing African #Christians #Jews, hell, he supported @MBuhari into power, so that the oil blasted comedy can continue..Sure he came to the wedding, he helped to finance it. I find this exttemely embarrasing, & you? #FreeBiafra
949 2018-07-12 21:55:32 Ok, here we go backward in "great progress" as the U.S. accuses N Korea of violating UN sanctions by illegally obtaining oil. There goes the progress, there goes peaceful resolution to denuclearization, here comes hostilities between the U.S. and N Korea.

964 2018-07-12 21:53:43 I get so annoyed when ppl say “castro oil” instead of “castor oil” why are you dumb
965 2018-07-12 21:53:42 Oil comes from Russia or us. Hillary's strategic plan was for the US. You don't have a plan.
966 2018-07-12 21:53:40 I know that big industry causes the real environmental damage by causing widespread havoc with oil spills and poisoning anything that breathes but as a recovering smoker I do feel bad for flicking cigarettes around for the many years of smoking in my life
967 2018-07-12 21:53:37 Don’t tell her nothing her ass gone blow that damn car up. This heat w/o an oil change gone have her in somebody burn unit.
968 2018-07-12 21:53:30 Add oil to a fire.
969 2018-07-12 21:53:21 Backwardation is due to political reasons. Nobody can predict what will happen over the next months, yet from production capabilities, there is no shortage. Prices are high enough that investments will go much higher. In my view oil has lost momentum.
970 2018-07-12 21:53:17 Norway is one of the richest countries in the world. They rape nature for oil and cool, hard cash. That's socialism to you? There are plenty of rich people, and they are not without their poor. Elements of socialism due to a big safety net, sure, but hardly socialist.

975 2018-07-12 21:52:26 John, that seems to meet the definition of sedition.  You and I both know the history of the EU in regards to Russian heating oil.  I find your position curious, you support paying to defend the EU from Russia, while the EU funnels the money to Russia?
976 2018-07-12 21:52:17 correct sir! but the expansion thing cannot be overlooked, most ppl dont know about it, I had to field countless calls on a weekly basis of ppl screeching @ me their heating oil tank was not full.

978 2018-07-12 21:51:43 We pay 70% of the NATO budget, while Germany is buying oil and gas from Russia.  Aren’t we supposed to be defending these people against Russia? Instead, they are making Russia richer!
979 2018-07-12 21:51:25 So, more questions than answers... I think oil is quite a complex one to deal with (which makes supply side policies more interesting). I am not convinced how well a conventional policy (carbon tax) would work broadly across oil. Oil is something we have to wean off... /end

990 2018-07-12 21:50:21 Yesterday the price of oil had a massive drop following the news that  Libya plans to resume with exporting oil. This massive on day drop last  took place a long time ago. Price even reached 72.94 (which is a support  level) from 78.26, now that was a huge drop in price.
991 2018-07-12 21:50:07 Taxes paid, insurance paid up until September , oil changed .... now i need a full tank and wash 
992 2018-07-12 21:49:50 You already have so much advice I don’t think mine will help but you can try not washing your face for a few days .. just use cotton and micellar water to cleanse and then moisturise with just grapeseed/avocado oil (you can add tea tree or lavender oil to this) (1)
993 2018-07-12 21:49:43 You want to see some real skid pad testing... put an oil drip over the drive tires... lots of ways to make this look impressive that mean nothing

1003 2018-07-12 21:48:51 Chamomile tea, rescue remedy drops if needed and lavender essential oil in your pillow on some cotton wool or on the soles of your feet, really helps get to a deeper state of sleep than normal.

1005 2018-07-12 21:48:43 //Reported that bitch lol
1006 2018-07-12 21:48:28 Except that WE THE PEOPLE should not be subsidizing anyone's OUTSIZED PROFITS with OUR tax dollars & when pay is so low that folks must then rely on "Public Assistance" just to get by, that's exactly what's happening!

Good God, we still subsidize Big (Billions in Profits) Oil!
1007 2018-07-12 21:48:25 They say different things hit different people in different ways, maybe this is just one that wasn't a feeling for ya. But there are benefits to using CBD oil. i know it was a small bit of interest/controversy when a fighter admitted he was using it to recover from his fights
1008 2018-07-12 21:48:23 SOPHIE’s “OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES” is an actual masterpiece. There’s so much emotion, and so many stories, that unfurl from its often chaotic sound. I honest to god listen to it almost every single day.
1009 2018-07-12 21:48:23 I want what they are smoking
1010 2018-07-12 21:48:22 When you’re independent grown up lady who needs a lil help from dad taking your car for an oil change, how much time in African father level lecturing is justified...asking for a friend
1011 2018-07-12 21:48:03 There are smart Americans, but they are fewer than 1 in 1,000,000. So, maybe there are 330 in the USA. They're surrounded by idiots who, if their political "revealed preferences" are any indication, should be boiled in oil for allowing totalitarianism to rise to power in the USA.
1012 2018-07-12 21:47:58 Big Oil money!!! Lol. It really ain’t THAT bad. I’m sure winter is going to be awful though.
1013 2018-07-12 21:47:58 So why are we subsidizing coal, oil, airlines, arms manufacturers?

Public subsidies for beneficial new technologies has been a function of government since day 1

But you are part right. We “subsidize” mature businesses who do not need it, and ones that have negative impacts
1014 2018-07-12 21:47:46 I am not clear whether a low or high oil price is a good thing because of investment cycles. If a low price leads to under-investment, then a high price & over-investment, etc, then it may unravel good climate policy? What is the optimal oil price in a climate setting? 5/
1015 2018-07-12 21:47:45 add a little VIRGIN olive oil, works like a charm
1016 2018-07-12 21:47:26 This is me but instead of coconut oil it's this very comfy desk chair I got for 3 dollars today.
1017 2018-07-12 21:47:09 Where are you going to get that oil change?
1018 2018-07-12 21:47:08 Keep digging.
1019 2018-07-12 21:46:56 Recycle used mascara. Use them to comb eyebrows, apply length-boosting castor oil to lashes, tame baby hairs near the temples with hairspray.

Wash the wand in hot, soapy water. Then, sit it in a container of isopropyl alcohol for about thirty minutes. Rinse well and dry.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1021 2018-07-12 21:46:51 It will ... but you’ll be surprised how much it will fade with time! I speak from experience. I broke my ankle and had a plate put in 4 years ago and the scar is so much better than I was afraid of thank God ... and use Vitamin E oil!
1022 2018-07-12 21:46:45 did you figure out the oil she uses?
1023 2018-07-12 21:46:35 Your news article was the most informative one I've read, Vince.

It angers me so much! Locking up water protectors - when will they realise THAT YOU CANNOT DRINK OIL?!
1024 2018-07-12 21:46:33 Talking bout free oil changes for five years. I’ll rather fucking pay vs waiting two damn hours
1025 2018-07-12 21:46:29 //It's wrong to group all straight men together and call them horrible things, Even as a joke.
1026 2018-07-12 21:46:20 And of course much of their crisis is a) the oil market crash, and b) the  holding back of goods by the private sector owners
1027 2018-07-12 21:46:20 Deciphering #Trump’s Real agenda:

1. #Germany to replace cheap #Russian gas with expensive US gas (while #USA buys 1.5 mil barrels of oil a day from #Venezuela & #ksa)

2. #NATO members to buy more US weapons

3. #EU to be weakened thru hard #brexit

4. Germany is an enemy
1028 2018-07-12 21:46:19 There seems to be no distinction between coal (bad), oil and gas (least bad) or awareness on what energy sources can replace fossil fuels. Need realism before ideology
1029 2018-07-12 21:46:17 I’m at a drive thru oil change place by accident. I didn’t know they actually have places that did this. Color me impressed
1030 2018-07-12 21:45:55 Employees that are unhappy can find work elsewhere. If that means living in a camper trailer in North Dakota working in the oil field making $90K a year than so be it.
1031 2018-07-12 21:45:46 Mix 2 1/2 pints chick peas with 3 pints Cabbage. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Drain. Serve on salad
1032 2018-07-12 21:45:43 A drop of pure and natural extra virgin olive oil is an amazing moisturizer for your skin and won’t clog pores!
1033 2018-07-12 21:45:40 Honestly I use coconut oil, aloe and Mario badescu facial spray
1034 2018-07-12 21:45:35 He’s also know to mix vinegar and oil

Obviously doesn’t give s shit about the environment
1035 2018-07-12 21:45:24 I jinxed myself with this tweet. I tried to apply some sunscreen that had apparently separated while in the car, and just the oil spewed out all over me. Definitely recommend having the microfiber cloth.

1038 2018-07-12 21:45:02 Gov't revenues dropped because oil sands royalty % rates are are linked to price of oil, no? 

How did Norway fair during this time? 

And how, with oil prices up, is Alberta still running an $8B deficit?!
1039 2018-07-12 21:44:59 one of my careers was in fuel (IKR) and ppl were forever going crazy bc their heating oil was less than they were charged but it was bc the heating oil expanded while hot and shrank when it cooled.

1042 2018-07-12 21:44:43 At the moment Trump is a massive factor..I feel his trade war will end sometime after the US elections....  IF it doesn't then oil could fall because China's economy is a massive user and any slowdown there would mean an over supply (absent any corrective action).
1043 2018-07-12 21:44:34 //I'm straight. That doesn't make me a monster, or a demon like so many people tell me.
1044 2018-07-12 21:44:27 They just add the flavor to the oil. probably add a drop or two of them has ever flavor
1045 2018-07-12 21:44:25 One of my favourite scents!  The body oil is to die for!

1047 2018-07-12 21:44:15 Yeah I should’ve used some type of oil ! But it was coming off already so I just pulled it off gently but it still hurt her 
1048 2018-07-12 21:44:05 Disgusting isn’t it? Heard he’s being sued for defamation. This isn’t a partisan issue. this is a matter of speaking up about the truth. Plus he claimed tap water was a gay bomb turning “the freaking frogs gay”. Much of what he says is absurd. Plus his overpriced snake oil items.
1049 2018-07-12 21:44:02 For spot treatments, I like things with tea tree oil or sulfur - masks are always good.

1052 2018-07-12 21:43:39 Love it! This recipe has cheese and also a decent amount of oil, which makes it have some protein and be pretty filling
1053 2018-07-12 21:43:39 I just saw 2 teenagers playing with a tech deck box set and fumbling around with nic oil, complaining that their mom won't buy them a vape.

1057 2018-07-12 21:43:26 All the oils have their price but all are dependent on the global situation overall in oil production... none become sort of *super expensive champagne* , or their price somehow staying impervious to the general price fluctuations according to supply & demand.

1092 2018-07-12 21:38:44 Fair point but the story has to be communicated both ways. Buying more oil from Saudi won't make fuel any cheaper especially with whats happening in Saudi
1093 2018-07-12 21:38:20 @Toyota it’s a bummer you won’t stand behind your products. My Tundra with 38,000 miles has a small oil leak that has caused two alternators to fail.  I’ve already spent $1,500 on fixing alternators and you want $3,200 to fix the oil leak. A truck this new should not be leaking.

1100 2018-07-12 21:37:13 Its not as easy as that....CO2 when mixed in an oil reservoir at high enough pressure can reduce the viscosity and enhance recovery, but it is a very involved process. Not so great in pressure depleted reservoirs...

1103 2018-07-12 21:36:54 Well the Saudi crown Prince is chasing away internationals working in Saudi and the economy now suffers from the effects of volatile oil prices and the young crown prince’s reforms. We are a rescue plan.

1114 2018-07-12 21:34:31 Yes there are dozens of different types of oil chemically.  Thousands of oil fields.

Brent Crude is a benchmark price.

That isn't the same thing as saying it's *special* above other oils or it somehow *sets* it own price apart from global oil production.

If electricity or agriculture doesn't decarbonise as much as necessary, then I don't think oil (supply) will lift its game to compensate. The question is then whether we force a 2C path top-down (which I think is unlikely) 2/

1139 2018-07-12 21:31:05 Here's food for thought. The United States has vast reserves of both oil and Nat gas. And they can be completely energy dependent, but guess what? They'd rather export it to get better prices overseas. Capitalism right there. Lol. Forget helping your own country out though.

1153 2018-07-12 21:28:26 A tough question... We may naturally move away from oil, in the same sense we move away from coal. The challenge with oil (in climate) is that it has so many uses (cars, freight, aviation, shipping, non-energy), & it may therefore "hang around" without obvious alternatives 1/
1154 2018-07-12 21:28:22 I love you. Please fill me with oil.

1167 2018-07-12 21:26:43 Depends if we don't get in first brother. Sequestering carbon into these materials is not a bad thing. Hydrogen is as clean as it gets if it is produced cleanly. It suits our tikanga not to pollute our whenua with oil residues.
1168 2018-07-12 21:26:37 Rudolf Diesel's first engine ran on vegetable oil. He died "mysteriously".
We can run engines on plant material but then they couldn't manipulate the prices DAILY.

1183 2018-07-12 21:25:14 How does demanding they increase their funding and by oil from us instead of Russia weaken NATO? There is no way you would be against this if a democrat president was doing it. No way. Your argument is utterly illogical.
1184 2018-07-12 21:25:14 I thought that that must be some long workday! My father and dog are both taking CBD oil, which is helping them immensely, so I've become very interested in all the aspects.
1185 2018-07-12 21:25:14 There is a strategy for Trump. Destroy NATO, do "business" with Russia. Trump has probably been promised some kind of back end to the Arctic oil fields if he can get rid of the sanctions. I'm sure it's worth billions.
1186 2018-07-12 21:25:06 Albertans don’t set the price of oil. Can you tell me your plan to help Alberta develop other industries so we don’t rely on one?

1188 2018-07-12 21:24:39 What man can't change oil, change a tire, cut grass, build and fix shit?
1189 2018-07-12 21:24:34 And oil companies know their disastrous effect on global warming, but why should they cut into their profits? Just because they are destroying the environment. 

This is what happens when an entire party (in charge) deny science.

1192 2018-07-12 21:23:54 Gas for cars is predominantly the by product of oil refineries. Liquid Petroleum Gas is mix of propane and butane. Think BBQ cylinders and cigarette lighters. We are importing more from Middle East as we close refineries but some does come from gas fields.

1278 2018-07-12 21:13:13 You open "convenient memes for clueless teens", and browse for a few minutes. Refreshed, you head out to the art store and buy a set of oil paints for your new portraiture skill.

You step back and see what you have made. A traditional-style oil portrait of Pepe the frog.
1279 2018-07-12 21:13:07 It was not so long ago when cabinet approved to build an oil storage facility at a cost of +-2 billions (with a loan from China) just to store oil for 20 days.....!

1282 2018-07-12 21:12:47 Yes love the smell it gives off! Not 100% sure but maybe it is slippy from a build up of oil from the roads being spread to the pavement.

1284 2018-07-12 21:12:39 I went from @Joico purple hair, to blonde in one day.
Forgot I had some @bumbleandbumble invisible oil!
LIFE SAVED. @olaplex #4&5 have been working magic. But that invisible oil puts the magic back in these ends after styling
1285 2018-07-12 21:12:33 Natural hair mutuals, are y'all still using eco style gel? I'm thinking about buying the black castor oil and flaxseed gel.
1286 2018-07-12 21:12:14 AS SOON AS I FUCKING GET HOME I DROP THE OLIVE OIL AND IT BREAKS IM SOOOO DONE

1290 2018-07-12 21:11:39 Those abusing GEJ must give him credit. He took the oil money from his zone to build a world class railway in the North (Abuja to Kaduna) which was commissioned by PMB today.
1291 2018-07-12 21:11:38 My scalp literally drinks oil like damn
1292 2018-07-12 21:11:31 this coconut oil got me smelling like kettle corn 
1293 2018-07-12 21:11:29 well, its no secret that im a huge proponent of the classic Italian. an Italian minus capricola on a fresh italian roll, garnished with lettuce, red onion, spinach, black olives, oil and maybe a light drizzle of vinegar and parmesan, toasted to give the bread a light crispness...
1294 2018-07-12 21:11:25 I have that eucalyptus oil Epson salt....boy!
1295 2018-07-12 21:11:17 I’ve never had the really expensive ones so I don’t know if they taste different but they have a musky buttery taste. If you have 10$ to spare you can buy some oil and try it.
1296 2018-07-12 21:11:09 What's the best gun oil for a gun hole?
1297 2018-07-12 21:11:02 im so sexy im bouta oil myself up and hump a teddy bear
1298 2018-07-12 21:10:59 Dear Twitter artists:  help. I am looking for an oil painting from the Gertrude Stein collection, entitled "The Tulips."  It's around 2x3 feet, and there is no known reproduction of it. She acquired it in the early 1930s.  Thank you!
1299 2018-07-12 21:10:57 I’m going to make a hair mask out of spirulina, fenugreek, bhringraj, neem, hibiscus, aloe vera powder, coconut milk, avocado oil, rosemary oil, & honey.
1300 2018-07-12 21:10:52 You probably need a oil change lol
1301 2018-07-12 21:10:50 Restale de costos gas oil, amortizacion del camión, IVA, impuesto a los ingresos brutos, impuesto a las ganancias, impuesto al cheque, impuesto automotor, peajes, VTV...

1303 2018-07-12 21:10:42 Question for you:  Why do we have to destroy Venezula?  Our gas prices skyrocketing (even though crude is dropping} for american oil company greed is going to be bad.  What is the end game?

1306 2018-07-12 21:10:29 All he did was gripe. Then at the end implies head cases like Oil Can Boyd & man-sluts like Wade Boggs would help bring a face to the game?

1309 2018-07-12 21:10:19 White rice and uhhhhhh chili oil into chowder* just like bermuda.
1310 2018-07-12 21:10:12 There’s still a big thick slice of privilege on that, but accessibility is increasing. Just not fast enough to achieve ubiquity. Having a parallel H2 market would help, and but we might need an oil shock to kick it off.
1311 2018-07-12 21:10:12 Hemp Oil has cured epilepsy for many people. You might want to look into that.
1312 2018-07-12 21:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this July? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

1316 2018-07-12 21:09:43 In oil fields, a roughneck's duties can include anything involved with connecting pipe down the well bore, as well as general work around a rig. The crew of a land-based oil rig can be further divided into several positions: Toolpusher: The highest position at drilling location
1317 2018-07-12 21:09:42 Getting that fresh oil change....
1318 2018-07-12 21:09:42 Went from $60 to $35 on my oil change  & got the same oil for high mileage. Fucking bettttt lol
1319 2018-07-12 21:09:30 EPA and DHA derived from fish oil supplements is much cheaper than EPA and DHA derived from algal supplements.
1320 2018-07-12 21:09:28 Up came to ask for you must pour oil on the ground, and flourished, and says she, "Good morning, auntie," says the girl,
1321 2018-07-12 21:09:23 Who violated UN sanctions by delivering oil to NoKo?
1322 2018-07-12 21:09:15 I will miss you tonight. Can not get in on-time!
1323 2018-07-12 21:08:46 I have oil envy.
1324 2018-07-12 21:08:29 I learned C++ at undergrad. Never used it since. You are right. I think VBA is quite important for any job that requires excel.
1325 2018-07-12 21:08:27 So the oil companies propaganda appears to be working. Fight back. Buy a Tesla
1326 2018-07-12 21:08:19 Yes Venezuela & their Killer Dictator who arrested Opposition Political Parties. Yet Ontario & Quebec buy Venezuela’s Oil by Tanker Ship. Insane! 
 More Insane Quebec won’t allow a Alberta Pipeline but takes 10 Billion a year Equalization $ from 
Alberta’s oil revenue. Insane
1327 2018-07-12 21:08:18 idk a good one with good meat and cheese and maybe a nice oil based condiment. also amazing bread, the whole sandwich toasted, but untoasted can also be really good. some kind of vegetable
1328 2018-07-12 21:08:14 Oklahoma has a pretty strong oil and gas industry going for it.  Not a lot of unemployment.  If you want to work there you can find a job!

1336 2018-07-12 21:07:20 This week:  price decreases on Land O' Lakes cheddar, 36/lb. butter solids, and 35 lb. Clear Liquid Fryer Oil.
1337 2018-07-12 21:07:10 Yup so you definitely would need a oil change that often
1338 2018-07-12 21:07:09 It's printed onto the mug. You add SR flour, sugar and Coco powder to the lines then one egg, 9 tsps of oil and 9 tsps of milk. 3 mins in the microwave.
1339 2018-07-12 21:07:02 I don’t use guns to get out of my mess. I use oil to get out of my mess.
1340 2018-07-12 21:06:29 Yes!! I love rosehip oil! So good for breakouts and fine lines!

1346 2018-07-12 21:05:27 Crazy earache and @CazJones6 tells me to put coconut oil hair serum in my ear because it’s the closest I had to coconut oil. Only clown I know to listen to him. Genuine don’t have a ear left 
1347 2018-07-12 21:05:23 This is a good thing.. Bigger oil reserve means we can regulate our patrol prices better, mind you we buy half our oil from them.. Renewable energy means cheaper electricity.. This is a win but joe will find a way to criticize..
1348 2018-07-12 21:05:19 The war machine can not function without ready supply of oil
1349 2018-07-12 21:05:18 Your allowing Canada to pipe their oil through U.S. just to sell to China! You don’t care about our country unless you get personally get a kickback. Your game is so old...
1350 2018-07-12 21:05:06 Half of @McDonaldsUK truck fleet is run on biodiesel from the restaurants’ waste cooking oil.
1351 2018-07-12 21:05:02 lemme come rub beard oil in ya beard
1352 2018-07-12 21:04:39 That's sort of thing is disgusting, but animals sponsored by plastic, which is part of big oil? Its perverse.
1353 2018-07-12 21:04:35 I hate the way coconut tastes and smells but I love how good for my hair the oil is and how easy the oil makes putting dragon and horse dildos in my butt.
1354 2018-07-12 21:04:10 Yeah I've been eating lots of healthy fats (olive oil, coconut oil, butter, avocado etc.)
1355 2018-07-12 21:03:58 #OOTT #Oil #WTI
During current ultra bear run, all pundits who had predicted $100 a barrel oil have disappeared all together. This is a temporary phenomenon. When #US Oil surges again to retest 75.24 later, they will show up and talk about the same cliches again.
1356 2018-07-12 21:03:57 Remember when they pumped all that oil into the Gulf of Mexico?
1357 2018-07-12 21:03:45 Snow’s BBQ is a bit more heralded but it’s in Lexington an hour away and you’ll be waiting in line all morning. I’ve never been.

Dixie Chicken is supposed to have good burgers. You can get the same burgers at a place called Chicken Oil in Bryan w/o the crowd. They’re ok
1358 2018-07-12 21:03:40 Jw why I have to make an appointment & still wait 2 hours for an oil change......
1359 2018-07-12 21:03:36 @gardein's vegan fried fish fillets are godlike. I love frying them up in olive oil and adding parsley/lemon.
1360 2018-07-12 21:03:31 They're making a Blacksad video game, based on the graphic novels by Juan Díaz Canales and Juanjo Guarnido.
I'm also attempting to season a cast-iron frying pan with flaxseed oil, which is going wonderfully.
1361 2018-07-12 21:03:26 One of the perks of being cute , I always get a discount on my oil change 
1362 2018-07-12 21:03:09 Exactly why its in energy.. Bigger Oil Reserves and cheaper electricity
1363 2018-07-12 21:03:05 This what I get for making my car hella low. No where can do an oil change for me
1364 2018-07-12 21:02:55 I forget the figures but seem to recall this one trade accounts for about 10% of all international oil sales - a serious blow to the petrodollar. And a yuan denominated oil futures market has also opened.
1365 2018-07-12 21:02:47 Guilty of showing off for a woman? If that was the case George Bush Jr should be in jail for how many times he bragged to topless dancers that his daddy POTUS was faking a war with "Sand-Ns" in Iraq so Houston would boom with oil $ from offshore drilling that profited Bush family
1366 2018-07-12 21:02:31 You people don't know what you want.. Do you want our oil prices to be stable or not ? Do you want our electricity to be renewable which mskes it cheaper... Saudi Arabia is ritch and its investment is good for us.. R112 bn is a lot of money to us and nothing to them.
1367 2018-07-12 21:02:24 Y r u insisting no oil be sold to them , then if they r so beholden to ur greatness?
1368 2018-07-12 21:02:19 Just doing some drawing practice today.  I might do some oil painting practice too, but no serious art.
1369 2018-07-12 21:02:17 Just got three phials of #CriticalRole themed perfume oil from @Dragonsworn_ cosmetics and was DELIGHTED to find a little Percy sampler included (bought Caleb for myself and 2 different scents as gifts).
1370 2018-07-12 21:02:04 Anyway they need to hurry up with this oil change

1375 2018-07-12 21:01:28 I take turmeric and ginger pills, Fish Oil, magnesium, B12, B6, iron, & Lysine. Ask me again why I always feel like something is missing........
1376 2018-07-12 21:01:20 I could have if I put some oil and spray it out but I would not look like cartoon goku, but one of those gay kids movies goku xD
1377 2018-07-12 21:01:18 Why is it so hard to schedule a damn oil change nowadays. I just had to schedule a week out. Wtf
1378 2018-07-12 21:01:01 oil will be at $130.00 +a barrel = buy US/Canadian  oil stocks /with dividends = you will make $
1379 2018-07-12 21:00:55 On a completely separate note... did you know that olive oil can only be used at a very low heat (under 325F) or it can produce carcinogenic toxins?  If your oil starts smoking on the stovetop, toss it. 
#NowYouKnow #Random #TrueStory

1381 2018-07-12 21:00:36 Just learned a REAL Caesar salad is : lettuce, olive oil, worshestershire sauce, l lemon squeezed, parmesan cheese,salt and pepper, all stirred/mixed together with 2 lightly cooked eggs, and croutons. Why can't life be like a ceasar salad?
1382 2018-07-12 21:00:33 This can help our oil reserve too.. Stabilize our patrol prices, and electricity

1387 2018-07-12 21:00:16 They about to rape every tree in that motherfuckers. They drilling for oil and shooting every animal they see as we speak
1388 2018-07-12 21:00:15 July 12, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1389 2018-07-12 21:00:13 Turns out coconut oil can be used as a thermometer using its viscosity as a judge of the temperature. Liquid - too hot, for example!
1390 2018-07-12 21:00:10 So why were raising money in California? And why would Texans want to be anything like California? Over regulated, shit and needles in the streets. Ban on guns and oil? 

No thanks.
1391 2018-07-12 21:00:06 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1397 2018-07-12 20:59:55 Put tea tree oil in it and it should clear up in a couple of days
1398 2018-07-12 20:59:47 Russia began short-of-war cyber attacks against us 20 years ago. 
Putin can't fix Russia's corrupt culture.
Can't fix failing economy built on oligarch patronage & oil prices
Can't fix the failed state, he is the state.

Fortress Russia is all he has left, Russia is not a friend.
1399 2018-07-12 20:59:32 sunscreens do not mimic melanin. melanin is not protection against skin cancer. sunscreen blocks UV rays.

While sunscreens are not a toxin, you may react to elements in a sunscreen (e.g. arachis [peanut] oil) so always read the ingredients.

1405 2018-07-12 20:58:55 Gee, the Trump Administration has discovered that Kim Jong Un is violating the UN sanctions on importation of oil products. Even after Kim and Trump met. Kim got oil AND the cancelation of military exercises.

But...but...he shook Trump's hand!!!!!

1410 2018-07-12 20:58:41 @NNachas1 you mentioned something once about  Shea butter vs coconut oil for the face..? I think
1411 2018-07-12 20:58:34 Electric cars and other technologies that don't depend on oil are a threat to Saudi Arabia, so they probably feel under pressure to act and get their global caliphate in order before demand for oil dissipates too much.
1412 2018-07-12 20:58:26 Well your God is not doing a good job....as he is blessing all the infidels!
You God made the West blessed with Wealth and progress?
You God is blessing South East Asia with growth?
You God discriminates and blesses Middle East with oil wealth
Why does he hate Africa and S. Asia?

1420 2018-07-12 20:57:29 I took my car into Ford on Friday for an oil change. Everything was perfectly fine before hand. Get it back the same day and suddenly the engine light is on. Took the car back in today and apparently it will take $1600 dollars to fix LOL #FUCKFORD
1421 2018-07-12 20:57:03 And Every dime of that will be going to big oil friends of the Trump administration for skyrocketing gas prices. 
1422 2018-07-12 20:56:59 Oil furnace ? Oil is minimal source for grid . Not saying coal is clean but it's shrinking share Vs natty & renewables . Not sure a true  detailed study exists ref enviro costs of batteries taking over the world
1423 2018-07-12 20:56:53 Any of your thought leaders going to talk about an oil and gas industry phase out? 

Because if you only focus on upstream emissions and ignore downstream emissions from burning Alberta's fossil fuel products, you might be accused of green-washing...
1424 2018-07-12 20:56:46 Renewable energy isn't a myth, but it will be close 80- 100 years before renewable energy replaces fossil fuels. 100 years ago, oil was where renewables are now. @CNBC

1433 2018-07-12 20:55:34 I’m at the Kia dealership getting my oil changed and the guy asks me okay which one is yours and I say “the black Kia”..........then I realized they’re all fucking kias lmao  
1434 2018-07-12 20:55:04 Mr Plamer we are not a country on its own...we interact with other countries... closed economic doors will not benefit anyone... we cry about petrol prices n Ramaphosa struck a deal with an oil rich country.... my hope is he knows what he is doing.
1435 2018-07-12 20:55:00 He's sitting on over 40,000 sealed indictments and ready to unseal them just as soon as a clear path is paved to see justice is served and not derailed. Wait for it ....we are nearly there! He and Huber have been busy burning the midnight oil.
1436 2018-07-12 20:54:59 So coconut oil stopped working for my itchy belly but Vitamin E oil is seriously the best thing ever! So much relief 
1437 2018-07-12 20:54:51 You do know that we get half our oil from them right? Next time dont use a car for transport half the time , walk instead akere you dont want anything to do with Saudi Oil.. You cant mix deplomacy and national security.

1448 2018-07-12 20:54:08 #Iranian people's money from oil is your allies' source of income. The regime is bribing them by signing contracts through which we are losing oil, land and sea. They do not even care about their own people getting killed in terrorist acts. They just think about money.
1449 2018-07-12 20:54:08 Serious question: why do random toiletries ALL run out at the same time? Body wash. Toothpaste. Deodorant. Shampoo. Mouthwash. Body oil. 

All different sizes of product. Different consistencies. I don’t understand, man. 
1450 2018-07-12 20:54:07 The oil is a sort of general rich, savory, umami kinda flavor. I don't think I've ever had one straight, but the oil adds a nice level to savory dishes.
1451 2018-07-12 20:54:06 Advertising strip shows is now national news? Sad
1452 2018-07-12 20:54:04 Investment shouldn't come at the expense of our economic freedom; the very same government is dragging their feet on bio-fuel regulatory framework. SA is capable of producing petrol/oil from maize/sorghum. Electric cars are coming, that won't be necessary!
1453 2018-07-12 20:54:03 Oil? Who said anything about oil? You cookin bitch? #BlackBush
1454 2018-07-12 20:53:26 IMF informed Russia not to create a Stabilisation Fund from excess oil and gas revenues. Kudrin ignored that. Who was right and who was wrong? Who followed IMF diktats and who did not?

1456 2018-07-12 20:53:10 Even if Saudi Arabia can give us free oil people will still complain. Where can we get investment since people don't want foreign investment. Mybe we must tell Motsepe to stop paying Barcelona and Beyonce millions just to come to SA and invest his money on development projects.

1460 2018-07-12 20:53:04 Cbd oil helps..
1461 2018-07-12 20:52:54 The belief that once you use synthetic oil, you can't switch back to conventional oil is a myth...

1466 2018-07-12 20:51:56 Tell Buhari to sell his jets and reduce his ministers running cost. You rant at the NASS, while PMB who doubles as petroleum minister loots oil subsidy money by increasing volume of fuel consumption from 35m litres to 65m litres by himself. PMB spends money without NASS approval.
1467 2018-07-12 20:51:30 Contrary to his claims,  his honesty, integrity and morality were lacking at the exact time he wants us to believe his judgment was sound.
1468 2018-07-12 20:51:22 Why aren't U tweeting about Germany giving Russia billions for oil & gas? We support Germany's shortfalls on paying NATO meanwhile Merkel gets a sweet heart pipeline deal w Putin?  So Russia is only bad if We have a relationship w them? I get it now! Ridiculous!!
1469 2018-07-12 20:51:15 Did you know we sell our customer favorite Olive Oil? It’s imported from Sicily- nothing but the best and most authentic for our customers! $20 for the large bottle and $12 for the regular!
1470 2018-07-12 20:51:13 Hillary would be a stronger defender in her speeches and meetings.

Trump is actually pushing them publicly to get stronger on military budgets and to be less dependent on Russian gas/oil, and buy more from us, of course)

Putin can't like any of that.

1474 2018-07-12 20:50:56 Remember a while back when people were using cooking oil as an alternative fuel? I bet that their cars are now in salvage yards due to an unhealthy diet.
1475 2018-07-12 20:50:41 Saw an oil drilling crew guy petting a black bear. Even luckier then he was stupid. The bear ended up paying for becoming a "nuisance".
1476 2018-07-12 20:50:03 @POTUS went to NATO and SLAMMED countries that are paying money to Russia for oil and gas whenever we’re the ones protecting said country from Russia. But @POTUS is colluding with Russia?  What......
1477 2018-07-12 20:49:44 how do i stop the ppl who change my oil from taking advantage of how clueless i am
1478 2018-07-12 20:49:39 Very well said... I would add the economic interest of Russia to derail the Paris Agreement and protect the their bread and butter... oil and gas.  The war on renewable energy has a deeper motive.
1479 2018-07-12 20:49:39 i for one say use more oil when you're grilling and frying sht.
nobody listens.
1480 2018-07-12 20:49:25 Cooking with butter bc it’s healthier and taste better than oil
1481 2018-07-12 20:49:14 @ProSyndicate smoked salmon CAN BE high in salt but best going with plain old salmon/plain old fish so you get the natural oils etc. *SAFETY*olive oil and some low calorie sprays as have a low flashpoint which = (use sunflower oil)  Mushrooms and no oil is good for you :) #chef

1491 2018-07-12 20:48:01 If NATO countries had trillions to spend on the military they wouldn't need the US.
Didn't Trump just sign an agreement with NK, of unknown content, which was immediately worthless? Trump is a snake oil salesman.
1492 2018-07-12 20:48:00 No need to adapt to however the wind blows when you stand on your principles. Weird, huh? Trump is a adultering, lying, cheating, snake-oil-selling POS. He was in 2015, he is today, and will be tomorrow. 

I stand firm on principles. You are welcome to swing in the wind.
1493 2018-07-12 20:47:56 Yes indeed John. I was not aware that BP was expert in Uranium. Oil and Gas I would listen to what they say. Nuclear Power....well I think us two know more about it than all of BP's "experts" combined.

1494 2018-07-12 20:47:28 What a shame!!! We are slowly loosing our culture. I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating vitumbuwa (fritters) instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
1495 2018-07-12 20:46:55 Soo yall are complaining about patrol.. We buy 47% of our oil from Saudi Arabia, they are investing more in our energy,, you are complaining... WTF do you want, we need toour increase our reserve so that we can manage our prices... We need investments not just in energy, all over

1501 2018-07-12 20:44:46 Cuz I’m, I would suggest a DIY with castor oil, black cumin seed oil, lavender oil and rosemary oil.  Make sure you use a towel on the pillowcase because it can stain.  @ttibbs80 any other recommendations?  Also check @KissedByABeeOrg. All her products are fab!

1504 2018-07-12 20:44:10 The future market thinks different and predicts oil in the 60s over the next years. And these are professionals. I think many financial companies predict high oil prices as they want to get rid of their underperforming oil assets.

1511 2018-07-12 20:43:11 Coconut oil has never helped me. It made my daughter eczema worse. Made my skin dryer instead of moisturizing. And its actually not good to ingest... It works for some. But not for us
1512 2018-07-12 20:43:11 And change the oil and put on a spare and throw a football lmao the fuck just answer the shit
1513 2018-07-12 20:43:10 If it is a continuum, why are the actors in today's government always rushing to tell us that the past government did NOTHING but squander oil windfall? The reason for this rush is the this government's rush!

Just like Merkel said, Trump’s USA is no longer a reliable partner. And Trump is a pathological liar who only cares about lining his own pockets, sensible countries won’t make deals with him.
1519 2018-07-12 20:42:38 Jealous of people who don’t have to spend $90 on an oil change

1526 2018-07-12 20:41:39 I just paid 64$ for an oil change I’m pretty sure I got ripped off.

1541 2018-07-12 20:39:35 No, it’s not. “Climate-gate” has been thoroughly debunked and the science confirmed over and over again. If a scientist wanted to get famous, he would disprove the science. No one has been able to. That’s when even the oil companies have conceded the point.
1542 2018-07-12 20:39:34 This the longest oil change ever...
1543 2018-07-12 20:39:17 Sounds like a great FFTT. I think perhaps what Trump doesn't get is that oil doesn't care how it's viewed. If they don't in fact "Shoot the Hostage" as you have spoken of then physics takes over & we revert to the historical outcome Price Controls have always led to #Shortages
1544 2018-07-12 20:38:54 You mean the President who just admonished Germany for buying Russian oil?  He’s HURTING Russia by trying to convince Germany to buy oil elsewhere. That’s BAD for Putin.

1558 2018-07-12 20:36:59 Well maybe if you coated them with oil at that same time.

1561 2018-07-12 20:36:44 Literally dripping sweat sitting in my car at an oil change
1562 2018-07-12 20:36:16 Finally got my air filter and oil changed now to fix that bigass dent from that dB that backed up into me 
1563 2018-07-12 20:36:11 Shh... don't let trump know. He'll think they were created by the democrats to stop his plans for oil and coal.
1564 2018-07-12 20:36:05 Oh wow. Coconut oil as lube? Yikes.
1565 2018-07-12 20:36:02 #Oil needs to die thanks
1566 2018-07-12 20:35:52 The only reason I know where there is one around me is that it used to be where I got my oil changed.
1567 2018-07-12 20:35:43 It’s so hot in my room, my coconut oil melted

1577 2018-07-12 20:34:08 The alternative is to buy American fracked oil gas instead - like Trump wants. Then no-one will be able to afford heating. No blackmail there.
1578 2018-07-12 20:34:07 Tara! Ready to listen 
1579 2018-07-12 20:34:05 There's nothing wrong with being a miyetti Allah patron but the fact that he is a patron of theirs means he should be able to talk to them the same way Jonathan was able to calm down the guys in the creeks when they crippled Nigeria oil output.
1580 2018-07-12 20:33:43 personally neem oil has been a hit or miss for me, it hasnt magically removed soil gnats for me like i wished, but re mealy bugs i just gave the plant a bath in soapy water + rubbing alcohol
1581 2018-07-12 20:33:20 Did I hear OIL
1582 2018-07-12 20:33:18 Here's some help. Clinton was an Ex-Pres % Lynch was the Atty Gen and she has since said the meeting was ill advised. Trump & Putin are current Pres. Putin has annexed Crimea, can disrupt oil mrkts, arm US adversaries, alleged to have killed opponents, & can start a nuclear war.
1583 2018-07-12 20:33:11 My own personal experience (Canadian): for CBD oil to work with my headaches/migraines I had to take very high doses ($130+ worth every 5 days). Tried oil with THC before bed & it helps my sleeping patterns & has decreased the overall amount of pain I’m in during the day.

Fry mushrooms in frylight! It's a spray instead of oil and it's muucccchhh healthier!!
1591 2018-07-12 20:31:52 Jesus spelled backwards is Susej! Like Sausage! COINCIDENCE? Sandy Hook was a test; everyone was a paid actor! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

1593 2018-07-12 20:31:35 On @business TV, Jim Paulsen asked what might trigger #recession, be a warning sign. Didn't hear #oil. Isn't it significant to pay 56c/gal more for #gasoline to go to work, shifting that money from consumer, savings sectors to #energy sector (see #consumer price #data). #OOTT

1595 2018-07-12 20:31:31 Zinke and Nunes are pretty tied up with them. Big ranching $, BLM mustang/burro slaughter/ oil leases/Big farm chemical run off. There is a lot there that the shock and awe of militias provide cover for.
1596 2018-07-12 20:31:30 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.
1597 2018-07-12 20:31:28 Could have done that years ago...diesal reached £6 a gallon.
That should be more a protest not Trump..oil being $76 a barrel just over half the price it was several years ago..
1598 2018-07-12 20:31:26 When you think about pulling out of the Middle East you have two problems.
Do you have enough oil to replace that supply point?
Are you willing to watch genocide of entire nations until some empire form there on the winning foreigner or local tribe?
1599 2018-07-12 20:31:19 Well, if an oil incident happens, you have the papers to prove it wasn't your fault.
1600 2018-07-12 20:31:17 I’m mad as hell. I was SOOOOO excited about the nacho fries coming back today. I went and got some. Rushing to my oil change appointment. Only to get to the dealership to find out they gave me nacho chips  @tacobell do better.
1601 2018-07-12 20:31:12 What for?  You wouldn´t be able to differentiate oil from GM and nonGM soybean. No matter which sophisticated technique you want to use. No in a thousand years. So why the labeling?
1602 2018-07-12 20:31:07 How much oil do we get from countries on your no travel list?
1603 2018-07-12 20:30:49 Both smoked salmon and mushrooms are healthy choices. A little bit of olive oil is also good.
1604 2018-07-12 20:30:48 It showed through our royalty review, that was supposed to provide the people, tax payers their fair share. It took one year to review. Uncertainty drove capital away. The end result... the oil companies kept more! Complete joke
1605 2018-07-12 20:30:47 True. But that was the result of two things: 1) the PC practice of relying on royalties to cover a quarter of their operating costs 2) the shift in which resource the government relied upon most (from gas, which paid high royalties, to oil sands, which pay much less). #ableg
1606 2018-07-12 20:30:43 Couple of months maybe. I have a set of Purdy Pro Extra I use in oil for external work. They must be 5 years old. Can't wear them out!

1621 2018-07-12 20:28:51 I would not put them on a par. Essential oils can give a nice smell to massage oil or flavour to some puddings, can't they?

1626 2018-07-12 20:28:25 No he was lambasting Germany because they have a oil deal/pipeline with Russia worth hundreds of billions of dollars while they are saying Russia is a bad actor. @POTUS was trying to get Germany to buy US oil and NOT Russian oil

1631 2018-07-12 20:28:05 Recall on the fan blade a 2000.Grand Cherokee. From that they found out we had transmission issues a stopped up catalytic converter and leaky oil pressure regulator. I told service manager if Any of that's wrong with it now I'm coming back for you. 
Guess what nothing was wrong.
1632 2018-07-12 20:27:58 Just got word by from my dealership. Honda gave approval to fix my oil consumption problem but they'll have my car for a week. Luckily they're gonna give me something to drive in the meantime
1633 2018-07-12 20:27:57 Look on Groupon! I always buy it from there, because my car needs full synthetic oil changes, which is almost $90! but on Groupon I’ve gotten them for about $20!
1634 2018-07-12 20:27:54 Coulda blurred out the toilet man
1635 2018-07-12 20:27:45 And no, Germany does not have as much leverage as Russia does for the simple fact that the world is increasingly energy hungry. China by itself could use every bit of oil and natural gas produced by Russia.
1636 2018-07-12 20:27:37 They need to sell us crude oil worth $10bn worth.
1637 2018-07-12 20:27:11 .@realDonaldTrump Solution to problem of wanting lower oil prices while also imposing tariffs that are harming farmer base: increase ethanol mandate from 10% to 15% - lowers oil demand, increases ag demand, lowers consumer fuel prices.

1639 2018-07-12 20:26:56 I took my car to the garage today to figure out why it's leaking transmission oil. I feel it's my duty to tell you the replacement part will only cost $20. So, the end is obviously near. Act accordingly.
1640 2018-07-12 20:26:55 Democrats came to the hearing equipped w/h Trump-accusatory speeches that were obviously written yesterday, since they missed the news re Merkle/Schroeder's Germany/Russia connection where 70% of Germany's winter natural gas & oil are now dependent on Russian goodwill for 30 yrs.
1641 2018-07-12 20:26:33 Free markets and geography. Don't we buy oil from some unsavory places? Manufacturing from China?

1694 2018-07-12 20:19:12 As opposed to the real ones Trump stirs up? Dupe. You're so out of it, the far right is the harbinger to corrupt kleptocracy largely fueled by oil and gas oligarchs. was that your revolution? That far left in your imagination is like 1% of the population. go to bed old man.
1695 2018-07-12 20:19:11 Get it proper wet, put some oil on the ass even. Marinate.
1696 2018-07-12 20:19:10 Actually, the US isn't this selfless angel. The invasion of Afganistan was for the control of the oil fields. Many American intelligence agencies operate all over the world to benefit the US. There is also a widespread feeling in America that their country is better than the rest

1699 2018-07-12 20:19:00 Obviously, 45*s “spiritual advisor” hasn’t read the Bible and should find another occupation. Shister Sister Paula White selling revisionist Christianity? Barker for snake oil on the side?
1700 2018-07-12 20:18:53 Eric you need petrol, oil and water to run a car. What you have there is merely the petrol.
1701 2018-07-12 20:18:30 Let me guess, we should be using your brand’s face oil.

1708 2018-07-12 20:17:46 If @jacindaardern had not announced the end to oil and gas just so she could have her speech at the UN perhaps the 600,000 from regional fund would not have to be spent immediately but a carefully thought out plan would have been put into place so other promised policies were met

1711 2018-07-12 20:17:31 Then. Union changed, democracy fluids. MOD review of alternative sites in rUK. Where considering the weapons are stored inside a mountain, not a shed. 570 civilian employees, the rest are MOD and mostly at sea. Turn the base into the HQ of Scotland’s defence or a gin oil base.
1712 2018-07-12 20:17:16 Grilled Asparagus with some mint and sea salt.  Grill long stem broccoli with crushed red pepper flakes an brush with olive oil. Love stuffed zucchini with portobello mushrooms or ground sausage ...

1714 2018-07-12 20:17:04 For one it's a different quality of oil and one doesn't replace the other. Secondly, there isn't pipeline capacity to increase production and get it out of the Permian basin till at least H2 2019.
1715 2018-07-12 20:16:59 Cause y'all are dumb.....if you can't see the financial benefits of it then SMH. Let's see how long oil is going to support the country.
1716 2018-07-12 20:16:59 You got oil change & full service money? 
1717 2018-07-12 20:16:58 You are a clown. NATO countries should not be beholden to Russian buying billions in gas and oil. Trump demanding this contracts be torn up stop billions flowing to Russia. That is not pro Russia. U have done nothing to strengthen NATO. Retire U selfish man. Let your Gov appoint
1718 2018-07-12 20:16:52 Yup China shopping soybeans from Brazil and other Asian countries. Oil being shopped from Russian,Iran,even Canada. China buys $1B of oil a month from US. They have the world to with. Getting more expensive for US and all of us with tariffs

1721 2018-07-12 20:16:38 It's the idiotic demand for palm oil that has driven vast areas of forest destruction, for what? Making fuel additive! It takes more energy to grow it than it delivers, and the fuel additive wrecks engines. Another brilliant ecomentalist cock-up!

1725 2018-07-12 20:16:10 OMG, Republican Trump toadies attacks on FBI agent have to do with what he SAID about how Republicans smell, that Trump toadies were hillbillies and that private texts were "salacious" ... desperate... Gowdy is spending extremely long hearing drilling dry oil wells ...
1726 2018-07-12 20:16:09 Next; stop tax subsidy on oil & gas and then finally, govt take back the $300bn proven reserves off Irish coast so state keeps in ground to then use the $300bn as collateral to fund wind/solar/hydro community co-ops to make us 100%. Like Holland & Denmarks ambition & leadership.
1727 2018-07-12 20:16:00 Hahahahahaha. I was taking oregano oil a couple of years ago, went and cut the grass, sweated and smelled like pizza.

1737 2018-07-12 20:15:28 Coming to DSM Toyota is one of the most annoying things in my life. All they are doing is an inspection... just an inspection. No tire rotation. No oil change. Just the inspection and I’ve been here for over an hour.

1747 2018-07-12 20:13:52 no friends or enemies.. only interests gentlemen. and oil/gas is of big interest to EU. Emil, what is your assessment on why Russia was not more successful in preventing the southern gas pipeline being completed?
1748 2018-07-12 20:13:46 Tea Party Members key funders aka Russian Oligarchs/Money Laundering? the top contributors to the Tea Party Caucus members are health professionals, retirees, the real estate industry and oil and gas interests. The Center said the contributions to Caucus Questioning Strzok!
1749 2018-07-12 20:13:41 So this aired on PBS...means the US is sending a msg to KSA - we’ll expose what you’re doing unless ... my guess is keep the oil price down until the midterms.

1752 2018-07-12 20:13:25 When I return to England I will tell everyone how racist Canada is+how the feds don't care about transportation for poor in north despite mass murders of aboriginals.Trudeau cares about expanding bitchymen pipelines more than reconciliation.He's bailing big oil out with our taxes

1759 2018-07-12 20:12:47 Since the US gets most of their imported oil from Canada...
1760 2018-07-12 20:12:40 I understand that
but we already sell enough oil from the tar sands to cause destruction to our environment both from retrieving the oil and from it's use

Govs shouldn't be investing in old tech 
Not when we so desperately need to be investing in the science of clean energy
1761 2018-07-12 20:12:35 India doesn't have oil, excess steel or uranium to export, Middle east country are only surviving because of oil

1763 2018-07-12 20:12:08 im not crash bearish here. i think that window has closed, but we are very thin and that leads to air pockets like the one we got in oil the other day. spx will be the same. likely all of june gains wiped out in one fell swoop

1767 2018-07-12 20:11:42 How was it not in their best interest.  Their were terrorist training grounds there who's sole purpose was to cause as much chaos in Western Civilization as possible.  France a few decades earlier had set up a Nuclear Program in Iraq and was getting much oil from Iraq.

1776 2018-07-12 20:10:15 "When [the caribou] want to go on a date, they invite each other to head over to the pipeline. So [his] real concern now is: if oil stops running through the pipeline, do we need a study to see how adversely the caribou would be affected if that warm oil ever quit flowing?"

1783 2018-07-12 20:09:25 Democrats and moral fiber is like oil and water.
1784 2018-07-12 20:09:08 And you say "overall, nope" because oil prices are high (more or less what your claim is when boiled down).
1785 2018-07-12 20:08:55 Yes. Oil is hydrophobic
1786 2018-07-12 20:08:54 Oil changed, shampooed seats, fresh wash, & full tank. Cool Whip is a happy girl. 
1787 2018-07-12 20:08:45 Zachariah tells us that oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The lamps are their knowledge of the Word of God. This suggests the church can have all the knowledge of the Word they want, but without the oil, without the SPIRIT of God, the door will be closed.

1791 2018-07-12 20:08:15 Oil issues finally...
1792 2018-07-12 20:08:12 Conjecture! Zero evidence. Oil based products are hugely net beneficial. Society, ie your life, wouldn't last more than a few weeks without them.
1793 2018-07-12 20:08:08 Would you be dry if you were covered in oil?
1794 2018-07-12 20:08:08 I honestly hate that everything has turned to coconut like oil and in ice cream and everything like we literally have to check every single thing lately because they keep putting coconut oil in everything, my dad gf is highly allergic to coconut and it just sucks :/

1810 2018-07-12 20:06:09 - Okay here's a Natural tip for you free of charge. If you are having stubborn stretchmarks on your skin, get a lemon zest, get an Aloe vera & coconut oil. Boil the them together till the aloe Vera & zest becomes black. Wait till it's cold & put inside a container.

1822 2018-07-12 20:05:03 Chick-fil-A has exclusively used highly refined (heat processed) peanut oil to cook Chick-fil-A chicken products since Truett Cathy created the Chick-fil-A Chicken Sandwich in the 1960s. He found it to be the purest oil to use, which was healthful and better tasting to our guests
1823 2018-07-12 20:04:55 Indeed. An extra 1 or 2 percent isn’t reassuring, if the company isn’t demonstrably abreast of transformative trends. 

If Ford was pumping oil, or making soap it’d be a different story.

1832 2018-07-12 20:04:08 Germany has enough money to build another natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and beyond – this will be the third.  Germany imports about half of its oil and natural gas from Russia; the new pipeline will increase that to 60% and serve France, Belgium & Netherlands.
1833 2018-07-12 20:03:59 @JCHLDZ Wesson oil?!!
1834 2018-07-12 20:03:57 hmm. it may be too much on them. look up a tea tree oil brush cleaner mix and try to do it.
1835 2018-07-12 20:03:52 Russia could care less about elections in America. They are concerned only with adding back countries to restore the old empire. That is it and they are using their oil production to finance it.
1836 2018-07-12 20:03:23 ''Yeah, i never saw you there''
1837 2018-07-12 20:03:23 Have no idea, but how much of that is due to cost of energy/transportation (oil prices? natural gas?)
1838 2018-07-12 20:03:19 Everything ever... previous owner driving habits, oil change intervals w/ specific oil/filter used, maintenance records including all previous CELs. But I’m just a lil ocd with my vehicles...

1846 2018-07-12 20:02:39 Thank you President and @KingSalman ! Indeed you trying hard going to countries trying to attract foreign investment, create employment and help curb the high fuel prices . You are really hard working, many won't see it, but you are! Saudi is the world's largest oil producer

1848 2018-07-12 20:02:22 There's a common misconception that oil is made from dinosaurs due to the name of "fossil fuels". In truth, oil is made from the bodies of millions of microscopic marine lifeforms.

1850 2018-07-12 20:02:09 The #UnitedStates has asked the #UnitedNations to cut off oil production for North Korea. - @AFP
1851 2018-07-12 20:02:08 It is warm to hear such proposals, however, we will be illusive to not acknowledge that the price of cocoa shares the same pattern as the price of crude oil etc. A natural guarantee to raise income is  introducing technology to help reduce cost of production.

1860 2018-07-12 20:01:06 The government of Lithuania has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Mel B in a polyester wig.
1861 2018-07-12 20:01:05 Ok so a girl put baby oil over the slides at the pool today and we have to close them for 2 days because they’re so fast it’s now unsafe.
I’m just mad I haven’t thought about this before
1862 2018-07-12 20:01:02 "evening primrose oil" sounds so pretty & delicate
1863 2018-07-12 20:00:50 I think that everything we create comes from petroleum. We live and sleep in and on materials derived from petroleum oil. Are these death shrouds cause the cancers we're seeing? Why are children being born with cancer? The health of humans have been compromised for OIL?

"While oil shale is found in many places worldwide, by far the largest deposits in the world are found in the United States in the Green River Formation, which covers portions of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming."
1873 2018-07-12 20:00:02 Either cut in half or third & slice them thickly lengthways, or slice into circles or chop into thick quarters, lightly spritz with oil, maybe a sprinkle of paprika and/or black pepper, then pop in oven around 180 for a few minutes depending on how soft or crunchy I want them
1874 2018-07-12 20:00:01 Ah, so after that we took your oil.... got it.
1875 2018-07-12 19:59:57 Great charts.  Would be great to run these numbers on the global oilfield service sector - very different!  After massive cost-cutting, ROIC still too low. Not sustainable and another reason why higher oil prices for longer ultimately needed #OOTT

1914 2018-07-12 19:55:28 The fall in oil production costs in the North Sea has been matched elsewhere (crucially in US onshore fracked oil)...so being cheaper (to produce) than you were isn't sufficient, nor the same thing as being *cheapest*
1915 2018-07-12 19:55:25 Oh God. What does he think he's doing? This guy is an oppressor. He's going to marginalise half of America if he keeps going like this. God help the States and God help the rest of the world, esp those with resources, oil, gas, water etc.

1926 2018-07-12 19:53:50 No need to get complicated. cut them in half, crack the claws, grill them (charcoal or wood, never gas), good olive oil and salt on top and that's it. Boiling seafood is a waste

2. The same blackmail option exists for oil coming from the Arab peninsular.  What makes Russia special?

For Europe Russia is a neighbor, first natgas and second oil producer in the world. Why on Earth would Europe hinder commercial relations with such a partner?

About 50%.
That means we "need" Russia for about 17% of our total energy needs, which isn't nothing, but nothing to fuss over since Germany alone has about twice the annual consumption stored 24.000 million m^3

2108 2018-07-12 19:31:10 And that's actually pretty darn sane for Mr. "the caribou hump the oil pipeline and the Muslim Brotherhood is in the White House" Gohmert.
2109 2018-07-12 19:31:05 The sun will evaporate the oil, & the blade.
2110 2018-07-12 19:31:04 German Hillary is colluding with Russia to purchase the majority of Germany’s oil and gas from them and yet MSM Is silent
2111 2018-07-12 19:30:50 Hey, didn’t the U.S. buy $7B worth of oil from Russia in 2017?

2117 2018-07-12 19:29:57 And instead he's telling people to smoke CBD oil? Wow!!! I'm sure he's done the research on vaporizing oil 
2118 2018-07-12 19:29:55 It really does control the oil! I don’t get as oily when I use this product before my makeup! A big WIN for me!
2119 2018-07-12 19:29:40 Oil
2120 2018-07-12 19:29:34 This your marketing over legit oh! The line "..wild bush mango seed sauce made with palm oil and pumpkin leaves garnished with slow cooked beef and goat meat cutlets...." Is actually the selling point Sir.
2121 2018-07-12 19:29:34 I have to get my car inspected, an oil change, turn 27, and get my life together all in the next 24 days...
2122 2018-07-12 19:29:29 Schiffty, your point is moot when Germany and other European nations are receiving 70% of their oil from Russia via the pipeline deal that was made. You must not have listened to POTUS’ point on this matter. Or, you’re just not very smart. Pay attention!
2123 2018-07-12 19:29:26 My jobs before #journalism:

2124 2018-07-12 19:29:25 Like i said no one likes it, there are EU countries who are also against it.

Do you support USA buying oil and selling arms to Saudi Arabia? Probably not, right. But what can you do about it.
2125 2018-07-12 19:29:24 Just cut your salt and change your oil . Switch to whole wheat. Drink more water and cut out juice and soda. Slowly bc it’s all about baby steps
2126 2018-07-12 19:29:20 He should ask them to give us oil!!
2127 2018-07-12 19:29:09 ''Yeah! Haha!''

Looks like she's having a lot of fun!

She's having her face licked.
2134 2018-07-12 19:27:50 Russian oil and Chinese jets on our dime. If so, why have NATO?
2135 2018-07-12 19:27:48 Marinated it in toasted sesame seed oil, rice vinegar, ginger, and soy sauce. Cooked it in some coconut oil.
2136 2018-07-12 19:27:46 73 dollars for a oil change 
2137 2018-07-12 19:27:38 Well as per Jim Rodgers England will be sunk without the oil, rUK & Scotland can all enjoy Junk rating after Independence, now does that work for you
2138 2018-07-12 19:27:38 Women want you to know how to change their oil but they gotta bus pass?
2139 2018-07-12 19:27:28 Vegan palm oil? You were making sense till that bit.
2140 2018-07-12 19:27:26 Waxed my  and it didn’t feel good at all.. luckily I had some coconut oil but it hurtttt like hellllll
2141 2018-07-12 19:27:24 Do you cook your eggs with oil or butter. RT for butter and like for oil.
2142 2018-07-12 19:27:09 Amen, it is an engineering marvel that the world can produce 100m bbl of oil a day. I might add that $70 a bbl is not enough to sustain this miracle which we will learn the hard way. Price controls like we saw yesterday will just exacerbate our problem.
2143 2018-07-12 19:27:03 -ate stock exchanges and separate "oil companies" still not divested and hence why the stock exchanges were broken up  over this point and ths explains the total valuation of Exxon/Mobil?
2144 2018-07-12 19:26:56 I do not care what my mother said all our bills are pay first of the month and done the upkeep on our Buick had the radiator flush and new antifreeze and change oil
2145 2018-07-12 19:26:36 @InfluensterVox @LaRochePosayUSA My skin is soooo god now! I just start the treatment 2 weeks ago and I can see the difference! It’s the best treatment to oil skin that I had. And look that I’m really inside of the cosmetic world. #Effaclar
2146 2018-07-12 19:26:10 Pretty common to hear folks in Dhi Qar complain about oil sector jobs going to folks from Basra or Missan. Similarly in Basra you hear people from villages in immediate vicinity of fields demand jobs over folks from next district over. Same dynamic in Kurdistan.
2147 2018-07-12 19:26:05 もうどこからが朝でどこまでが夜なのか全然わからぬ
2148 2018-07-12 19:26:00 Total bollocks. US doesn’t need Venezuelan oil. With fracking it’s got more than enough. In fact more than it knows what to do with. Look at rising storage costs and a stable oil price.

I’m afraid your lefty anti-American conspiracy theories are way off sunshine.
2149 2018-07-12 19:25:57 Jo, jag minns när jag betalade 480 kr i courtage på SHB för en affär i Lundin oil på 90-talet, så ha det så kul för mina pengar.
2150 2018-07-12 19:25:55 It would mean you producing  dodgy, easily debunked and downright nonsense from Wangs, Common Weal, BfS, the National etc. Like the fabled whisky expirt duty tax or hidden oil fields

2155 2018-07-12 19:25:21 Sometimes CBD oil can stimulate appetite. It has some other benefits but does have some dental benefits as well.
2156 2018-07-12 19:25:09 The Chevron Richmond Refinery, a company so large that it produces 240,000 barrels of crude oil a day. Richmond's population, a demographic composed primarily of minorities, are at a significantly higher risk of dying from heart and lung disease #PAER
2157 2018-07-12 19:25:07 Steal my sunshine........... besides that maybe shampoo & conditioner. Or a hair mask (I know I can use the fader but maybe an actual mask?). Leave in conditioner, hair oil, MAKEUP
2158 2018-07-12 19:24:40 A lot of EU countries are against that pipeline. And yes 9% of energy is bought from Russia. No one fucking likes it, but there is no better alternative right now.

USA imports oil from Saudi Arabia.
2159 2018-07-12 19:24:39 today’s goals:

2160 2018-07-12 19:24:16 I’m trying to get an oil change and the mechanic is talking to me about drinks to make with Bailey’s but he moved my car ahead in the line so I’ll drink to that 
2161 2018-07-12 19:24:13 Im actually worried about my families livlyhood. 
 My whole industry is in danger. it wasn't even on the negotiating table. Set aside for faux-virtues.  An aytempy to get a UN seat.  Oil and auto are not in JT's plan or scheer

 Tell me again who has my best interests in mind?

2165 2018-07-12 19:23:36 Salads for me are rarely of the lettuce leaves variety. Usually make ones with vegetables/beans/lentils mixed with rice, pasta, couscous, quinoa, or noodles. Dressing cld be oil & vinegar/lemon juice, houmous, tahini&vinegar, tapenade #veganrecipehour #notjustanotherboringsalad
2166 2018-07-12 19:23:35 Shyam: Funny, we get some of our oil from the Country who attacked us on 9/11 so what's your point? We pay more since we're fighting them over there so we don't have to fight them here (remember that GOP saying?)
2167 2018-07-12 19:23:34 still wondering, the sesnon-frew, thats the name of the formation, it still has oil in it. if this oil is still coming up with the gas...
2168 2018-07-12 19:23:28 Thanks for sharing.  A better title for the SA article would be “Fracking HAS Polluted Groundwater” or something similar.  @EnergyinDepth is an oil company shill.
2169 2018-07-12 19:23:24 What are vegans thoughts on consumption of palm oil, wheat, barley & soy beans??? #vegan #veganfood
2170 2018-07-12 19:23:07  honestly I think the most important step is not washing it for two weeks lol AND ARGAN OIL! (and @carolsdaughter black vanilla shampoo and conditioner on wash days)
2171 2018-07-12 19:23:00 wow i feel like an adult now. getting my car’s oil changed on my own and getting my passport done 
2172 2018-07-12 19:22:55 you mean, while there’s ppl out there going to other countries where we have no business being, shooting, bombing, killing people because we’re an imperialistic, xenophobic, oil seeking country, im on twitter calling out ppl for being racist? cause yeah that’s what’s happening
2173 2018-07-12 19:22:41 Hot oil.  And sadness.
2174 2018-07-12 19:22:35 Loool provide your own oil

2176 2018-07-12 19:22:28 Sad to see Conte leave but it's what's best for the club. Really thought after his first season he would finally be the manager who we'd have some stability with. Sadly him and the board were like oil and water. Board haven't exactly covered themselves in glory. Neither did Conte
2177 2018-07-12 19:22:23 Y’all be fuckin with niggas who don’t know how to change a tire , oil change , shit even wash a car ..... come on baby know your value 
2178 2018-07-12 19:22:23 Its as simple as the people, most investors and traders included, have no idea what it takes to produce a bbl (we use 100M a day) of oil. The time and $ to drill it, complete it, produce it... They think oil is what makes gas they get from a neat clicky thing...

2199 2018-07-12 19:18:54 Wrong he was getting NATO countries to pay more which makes him and NATO much stronger when he meets with Russia. Makes Russia weaker. If he gets Germany to stop buying oil from Russia, again makes us strong and them weak. Open your eyes and stop being an idiot.

2208 2018-07-12 19:18:13 Find it interesting how quickly investors even professionals jump on the consensus view.

2209 2018-07-12 19:18:11 I watched the 1994 Little Rascals with the kids and realized that our President, Donald Trump, is in it!!! His role, a bit of a stretch, is an oil tycoon and father of Waldo the rich kid that sabotages Alfalfa before the talent show. Can’t believe he didn’t win an award. Sad!
2210 2018-07-12 19:18:09 True, but it is incumbent upon people to do research for themselves or be taken by snake oil salesmen.
2211 2018-07-12 19:18:09 ~35% of all oil and gas to Europe comes from Russia. Next question.
2212 2018-07-12 19:18:05 I fucking love olive oil
2213 2018-07-12 19:18:01 Sure! I am specifically looking for vegan alternatives to fish oil, like flaxseed and algae oil, I am curious if you have an opinion about that either way?

2218 2018-07-12 19:17:47 The MSM has you fooled. Yesterday’s NATO breakfast is the perfect example. They claim he is trying to break up NATO to help Putin. Realistically Trump called for NATO to spend the 2% GDP that they agreed to (none of them do that). Meanwhile Germany gives Russia billions for oil!

2220 2018-07-12 19:17:39 marketers watch out for snake oil salesmen trying to wow u with talk of Contextual Commerce. it’s just shoppable content, frictionless paths to purchase & targting people based on the mindset & environment they’re in... all packaged in a snappy phrase
2221 2018-07-12 19:17:33 Apparently it’s a thing for Priuses to run without oil...

2243 2018-07-12 19:15:38 It leaves a little bit of oil behind but it’s a nice moisturizer. I always use witch hazel after too
2244 2018-07-12 19:15:32 I’ve totally done that on most occasions.
2245 2018-07-12 19:15:30 Initially, mine was alright. However, I'm sure after it was serviced the oil consumption got worse.
2246 2018-07-12 19:15:23 Keep shifting the goalposts, Conrad. Maybe later, you can explain oil markets to me again. It will be just like old times.
2247 2018-07-12 19:15:22 my palate is slick coated in oil, constantly, i don’t even need to chew anymore everything just slides right down
2248 2018-07-12 19:15:02 Read: Control the trade routes and oil access. Not just S China Sea.  Indian Ocean, South Pacific, and African sea lanes too. @MarkWarner @ForeignAffairs @ForeignPolicy
2249 2018-07-12 19:15:01 I don't usually do these kinds of things, but this product has really helped so many health issues for myself and my family. Good company, too.  1450mg Full Spectrum CBD Oil, High Grade Hemp Extract (50mg/ml) - 1450mg CBD. Check out my review.
2250 2018-07-12 19:14:58 It's a powder spray that soaks up the oil in your dirty hair.
2251 2018-07-12 19:14:39 we don't have to protest oil companies to put them out of business. we just have to tell our representatives to do it, and no one, not even SCOTUS, will be able to stop us.
2252 2018-07-12 19:14:36 Noted! Thanks girl! I just don’t like Witch Hazel cuz it doesn’t do a damn thing, Arian oil though—I’m reading on it!

2255 2018-07-12 19:14:33 i made THE BEST pasta salad the other day it has bow tie pasta, tomatoes, red peppers, parmesan cheese, spinach and a little bit of olive oil and salt and pepper. so bomb
2256 2018-07-12 19:14:31 The Household Hazardous Waste Center on Kerr St. serviced 990 residents in June, while the HHW in Mishawaka handled over 800.  Keep bringing gas, oil, paint, electronics, pesticides & herbicides to us, and we'll process it properly.  Good job St. Joe County @sjcindiana !
2257 2018-07-12 19:14:23 Necesito CBD oil ASAP
2258 2018-07-12 19:14:15 People wonder why I list these Twitter Ads.. 

It's because I refuse to promote the Saudi Muslim Oil Prince @FoxNews & @Twitter owner Alwaleed Bin Talal.. 

He's making $Trillions off of these Ads then paying @seanhannity & @IngrahamAngle to lie over & over again..

2259 2018-07-12 19:14:15 Might be a little late getting there. Getting my oil changed and a nail out my tire, gonna go home hit the showers then I'm out
2260 2018-07-12 19:14:06 What happened to the criminals who sold our oil reserves? Or we waiting for a commission of inquiry? Or oil reserve summit?
2261 2018-07-12 19:14:03 Tea tree oil or lemon oil. Rosehip oil also evens out skin tone 
2262 2018-07-12 19:13:58 Been smothering oil on myself all holiday and the last day I’ve used one different one and it’s given me a lumpy allergic reaction all over my body 
2263 2018-07-12 19:13:56 I dropped off my car this morning to get an oil change and not only did they wash my car they FILLED MY TANK and I didn’t pay anything, I love my Kia.

2271 2018-07-12 19:13:00 I went in for an oil change and they tried to charge me $63 for a flush. Best believe I called my daddy REAL quick 
2272 2018-07-12 19:12:52 back massages are lit. full of nakedness n coconut oil everywhere 
2273 2018-07-12 19:12:51 I think the foolish virgins’ insufficient oil suggests they either believe He’s coming earlier, or don’t know what to expect, perhaps because they don’t realize it’s important.
2274 2018-07-12 19:12:25 It's a conflict of interest if you put the head of a food company in charge of school foods. As for laws regarding oil, we voted for that.
2275 2018-07-12 19:12:23 I was trying to schedule some fillings for this lady and she told me she didn’t need one because she has clove oil that takes cavities away at home  I have officially heard it all
2276 2018-07-12 19:11:42 Well of course. The oil from people's fingers can cause delicate parts to rust which may ruin the functionality of the entire construct. Not just anybody has the privilege or the dexterity.
2277 2018-07-12 19:11:38 My teeth always feel proper clean and white after coconut oil pulling.
2278 2018-07-12 19:11:38 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2279 2018-07-12 19:11:30 I finally have the oil perfected that helped me get the tail of my eyebrows thick. 

I can walk out w no eyebrows drawn now lmao

2282 2018-07-12 19:11:15 Brandless gave me free virgin coconut oil with my last order, and so far the only use I've found for it is as a flocculating thermometer. 

80°F: Bottle of molten wax
75°F: Jar of pickled marshmallows
70°F: Tub of Noxema

I mean, you want me to EAT this? Get outta town, guy.

2285 2018-07-12 19:10:36 I went to Chevy this morning to drop off my car to get an oil change. I waited so long for the shuttle driver that they were already done with my car... cool that I got it back right away but I was 45 mins late for work
2286 2018-07-12 19:10:35 Been basically only breathing cbd oil and my juul since I got to nyc because my back is in constant pain 
2287 2018-07-12 19:10:29 I hope Iberia doesn't have oil. I'd hate to see Narnia invaded by mistake, though it would be funny to see the Pentagon trying to figure out which wardrobe made the connection. Lol

2289 2018-07-12 19:10:18 The fact is President Trump is talking about their oil and gas imports from Russia after the new pipeline is completed their Russian imports will be between 60 and 70 percent! FACT!

2292 2018-07-12 19:09:52 It sickens me that we’re thickly laying  on the pomp & circumstance for someone that not only mocks disabled people, but molests women, separates kids from their parents and is intent on destroying the world with his fossil fuel and oil industries. We are an embarrassment. #trump
2293 2018-07-12 19:09:45 It amazes me the lies & speculation @cnnbrk @wolfblitzer lets @RepAdamSchiff get away with. He won't even criticize Germany buying oil from Russia, but Trump is not allowed to talk to Putin. Why are you so afraid of Trump talking to Putin alone @TheDemocrats? Something to hide?
2294 2018-07-12 19:09:44 and if we keeping shit a stack NIGGAS don’t even know how change a tire or furthermore some damn oil
2295 2018-07-12 19:09:32 Kelewele got lots of oil and Mango got some antioxidants which is goo d for the system to reduce oxidative stress
2296 2018-07-12 19:09:26 I phoned @Audinorthcliff and told them about oil leak and EPS sign which comes on when I suddenly accelerate. This hasn't been resolved either

2298 2018-07-12 19:09:05 Also veggie and on FODMAP it’s fine once you get your head around what you can’t have. Garlic oil as a substitute and other flavoured oils a must. Every herb you can think and loads of chilies. It’s all good.

2303 2018-07-12 19:08:37 They will eventually print more debt out of thin air,then invade Iran,using Israel to start a conflict with them and steal all their oil,then they will take Libya,Saudi Arabia,and the whole Middle East.Problem solved

2306 2018-07-12 19:08:18 Mr President we hv enough electricity even if is expensive,we need oil pls.
2307 2018-07-12 19:08:16 Green sunlight bar...I've used it ever since I can remember...I use ponds flawless/vanishing oil too,maybe it might work for you too...just be careful not to try too many remedies to avoid your skin worsening.
2308 2018-07-12 19:08:08 Depressing and really it's all about the bottom line in Irish Politics, and I've seen nothing to suggest that the Government really has intent to improve things .  Scotland better, despite all the Oil, they've done a lot with renewables in recent years.  n/n
2309 2018-07-12 19:08:08 I just burnt my lip with hot oil  ufakefeshit!
2310 2018-07-12 19:07:54 One thing about Trump.. they said he's a racist, he's pardoned blacks Obama wouldn't pardon, they say he's a misogynist but he's appointed women to high level jobs, they say he's Putin's puppet but he's trying to get NATO to purchase less oil from Russia....(continued)
2311 2018-07-12 19:07:40 Don’t paint it while turned on ,makes life to hard ,but yeah I always use gloss or satinwood oil based they just try to sell radiator paint for profit ,this is my job so u will be fine 
2312 2018-07-12 19:07:35 That's how severe misinformation happens. My mom literally taught me to shove a tampon drenched in tea tree oil up myself if I develop a yeast infection. Government-mandated and regulated sexual health education is NECESSARY.
2313 2018-07-12 19:07:15 Want to talk about piping in oil from other countries? Ever heard of the Keystone pipeline?
2314 2018-07-12 19:07:07 I'm officially an old man. I have the arthritis in my right front toesies. Glucosamine and CBD oil from now on. Gotta ease up on the forest Chuck-Its. Sad aroo.
2315 2018-07-12 19:07:05 Not all corporations are bad, but they shouldn’t control US laws and judges, such as the EPA. Do you think Chobani had interests in changing environmental laws for oil?
2316 2018-07-12 19:06:53 Lol. So maybe Herr Orange should follow his own logic and not import Russian oil to the US. He was not slamming Russia, he was trying to cause dissent in NATO at do Putin’s bidding. No one is ‘walking away’ from Dem pty, but sure know a lot leaving Trumpublicanism.
2317 2018-07-12 19:06:42 Damn, pipeline did have oil in it!!
2318 2018-07-12 19:06:09 Oil and gas
2319 2018-07-12 19:06:05 9% of how much? My goodness they are building a pipeline from Russia to Germany! Again all countries can do what they want but it is wrong to feign disgust at Putin’s actions, at Putin’s morality ...and then buy Billions from him in oil! How are you ok defending their actions?
2320 2018-07-12 19:05:56 I need to get my oil changed so bad but I’m so lazy :-(((
2321 2018-07-12 19:05:52 Don't like to say it about my native country (even if not resident right now) but I doubt a single thing will be done to *really* reduce Carbon output.  For example, apart from the insane support to Oil/Gas firms over the decades, transport is Ireland is ridiculously car-based 
2322 2018-07-12 19:05:42 Our water and oil in our arctic waters Russia has its eye on.
2323 2018-07-12 19:05:41 @discordapp thr robot hamsters run out of oil again or are they rebelling
2324 2018-07-12 19:05:37 I believe a lack of sufficient oil reflects on being unprepared.The oil represents the Holy Spirit. Our relationship with Christ is key. Even in our wearied state the regeneration of the Holy Spirit is still burning within us, we're prepared for His return.
2325 2018-07-12 19:05:25 An anonymous source has disclosed to @MSNBC that Brett Kavanaugh once did not have his oil changed at 7,000 mikes according to the manufacturer guidelines. #BrettKavanaughScandals
2326 2018-07-12 19:05:25 Wait wasn't there a court ruling Tru,p can't block people? Why should a Congress member be allowed to block ppl?
2327 2018-07-12 19:05:20 We do, but the cost is disproportionate. 
While direct spending is in line, indirect spending is not. U.S  bases and cost of forward deployed troops benefit NATO primarily, but this spending is additional to funding direct NATO budget, as I understand it.

2329 2018-07-12 19:05:08 i didn’t wash my face this morning and there is enough oil on my face that if it were a piece of pizza a rail-thin girl would dab it with a napkin
2330 2018-07-12 19:05:06 I think negotiating is about what assets you bring to the table. If I am sitting down with Tusky and I am sitting on a chunk of oil reserves and gas deposits.. well I reckon I am going to get a good deal for Scotland. I have not even talked fish.
2331 2018-07-12 19:04:32 @POTUS You are not welcome. You are a sexist bigot. You have your head buried in the sand regarding climate change. You are a pawn of the oil industry which will destroy the planet. I do not know enough words to describe how much I despise you.
2332 2018-07-12 19:04:20 Holy oil
2333 2018-07-12 19:04:16 Bersihin pake baby oil aja
2334 2018-07-12 19:04:15 in my uneducated opinion... complex as the problem and solutions are. it does not hurt to have a simple, effective, and emotional message that even deniers can get behind. admit that lsd minded greenpeace was onto something. destroy those dirty oil companies.
2335 2018-07-12 19:04:03 Oil check!
2336 2018-07-12 19:04:00 Thanks to all your adorable kiddo & fur baby tweets & DMs, and a couple drops of CBD oil, i'm feeling a bit better this afternoon.

2340 2018-07-12 19:03:41 Autozone does oil changes...? Lmao
2341 2018-07-12 19:03:41 So Russia put trump in- to build the us economy, build US roads, take care of our US vets, strengthen the us military, decrease Russian oil access-crippling Russia’s economy? Or- is media covering for the actual crime by Clinton/mueller- selling uranium to Russia? #UraniumOne

2346 2018-07-12 19:03:22 Waiting to get our oil changed and we stood outside waiting for someone to greet us or take our keys for about 10 minutes. I never worried about bringing the kids because we were in and out. Today I’m a little nervous...

But at least the kids are holding  it together so far
2347 2018-07-12 19:03:14 Still cannot find @CountryCrock sunflower oil butter  @InfluensterVox #sparkvox #complimentary
2348 2018-07-12 19:03:13 It's actually one of the better ones left aside from the couple new ones we got. At least it doesn't burn a quart of oil every 500 miles like some of them.
2349 2018-07-12 19:02:58 Put on oil
2350 2018-07-12 19:02:57  They’ve really mugged themselves off. Trump will soon be gone and they can get back to protesting about oil extraction 
2351 2018-07-12 19:02:52 I guess I didn’t clarify, we were talking about coconut oil which has like a million purposes hahaa. But yes you’re right !!!
2352 2018-07-12 19:02:43 Thanks, good point. By your logic all CDNs should be lobbying for TMX.... we all benefit, significantly, by expanding markets for CDN oil.

2355 2018-07-12 19:02:27 I don't think homelands were considered under republic back then. Water and oil don't mix hence capitalism and communism don't mix too.
2356 2018-07-12 19:02:19 By even more equivalent logic: US gets oil from Canada, so Canada controls USA. And Trump, against protest, approved the 4th stage of the Keystone Pipeline to further that. So Trump gave control of America to Canada.
2357 2018-07-12 19:01:43 You're happy to take oil from Saudi Arabia who sent most of the terrorist in 9/11 not to mention Germany and the deal with Russia before Putin dictatorship and aggressive annexations! When are you going to INSULT Russia WHO IS OUR ENEMY
2358 2018-07-12 19:01:28 Chewin' terbakky, sweat, piss & gun oil.
2359 2018-07-12 19:01:27 This has been explained about 50,000 times.  All you have to say at this point is oil economy or resource state and people generally get it. Capital investment in people is low because it's an energy based economy and until now you don't need people to be smart or creative.
2360 2018-07-12 19:01:25 I'm sorry your husband Is a metro sexual.
2361 2018-07-12 19:01:22 Right. It falls in line with Trump/Russia collusion. Trump would be the worst as a traitor. How many other traitors try to bankrupt their partner? Look at how the president is trying to get American gas and oil into Europe to help ease the dependency on Russia.
2362 2018-07-12 19:01:17 THIS, this has to stop !  The human greed is getting totally out of hand, all for palm oil ? Absolutely heartbreaking. Disgusting & beyond belief, WHAT on earth has that poor baby & kie done to deserve this type of threatening treatment, THEIR habitat is invaded !! 
2363 2018-07-12 19:01:10 So I was talking to my mom on the phone while she got her oil changed, then her Bluetooth connected and I’m like “mom? Hello?” 

Turns out I was talking to the men changing her oil so that was awkward
2364 2018-07-12 19:01:05 The government of Namibia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Chrissy Teigen in a charvet wig.
2365 2018-07-12 19:00:59 $130 for an oil change? Yeah fuck foreign vehicles. You ain’t impressing anyone with those mf  you stupid
2366 2018-07-12 19:00:59 Also, Neem oil.
2367 2018-07-12 19:00:51 Oil first, and add a little water to your favorite leave in conditioner

2372 2018-07-12 19:00:23 No way in hell I’m going back for an oil change but I bought tires too so I get a free rotation every 6,000 miles. I’ll be strutting in with a huge smile

2376 2018-07-12 19:00:13 When I moved to Edmonton in 2002, one of my Albertan classmates exclaimed "who are you, Charles Dickens?" when I mentioned my family's home being heated with oil. (I then asked him what he thought happened to all the oil his province produced.)
2377 2018-07-12 19:00:06 A great way to get energy on keto is mixing a tablespoon of Ghee butter, MCT Oil & a teaspoon of cacao powder in your coffee. Gives a crazy amount of energy.
2378 2018-07-12 19:00:00 Man screw working in an office I’m gonna go be an Anti-porn snake oil salesmen.
2379 2018-07-12 18:59:48 The country not safe in your dirty socialist bloody hands!
2380 2018-07-12 18:59:40 just in case: The unrest did not impact production at West Qurna 2 or the other two fields, West Qurna 1 and Rumaila, two oil officials said. RTRS
2381 2018-07-12 18:59:34 The moral case and the economic reality of it cannot be reconciled.
2382 2018-07-12 18:59:14 I do not feel like getting this oil changed today I'm tired
2383 2018-07-12 18:59:11 Being nice to people pays off. Football season when I worked security I helped this girl out with something that was out of my way. Come to find out she works at Midas and she’s about to check me out for a free oil change! I’m so happy, ya boi is tryna save money!!
2384 2018-07-12 18:59:09 How is pornography harmful?
You seem to think that all CEOs are an unequivocal force of good. Does that extend to the robber barons of the 19th century? To those who profit from sweatshops? To oil magnates who pollute public land?
2385 2018-07-12 18:59:08 Finally get to do work with peanut oil
2386 2018-07-12 18:59:03 Let me see if I understand this. 

Republicans are concerned about an FBI agents bias possibly having an affect his actions during work, but believe the oil companies about global warming.

Did I get that right?

2387 2018-07-12 18:58:49 And where is the South African money for Diamonds  and Oil
2388 2018-07-12 18:58:48 Rep.Cohen comments how POTUS is talking with his friend, Putin. I resent this comment, greatly. NATO countries want help from Russian influences yet afford to buy oil and gas (Germany buys 23% gas/oil) from Russia yet they want U.S protection but don’t pay 2% of their GNP.
2389 2018-07-12 18:58:48 buying into the pure essential oil theory for multiple uses including relaxation. going out for some! :) 2018 is about experimentation and discovery.
2390 2018-07-12 18:58:36 Based on what evidence? Trump called for Germany to stop buying billions of dollars of Russian gas and oil!!!
2391 2018-07-12 18:58:25 And what’s even more disgusting is all the Demarcates fighting to hide Corruption!! This is a sad Day to watch!! They don’t want the truth! I pray come Election Day We don’t have any that’s not for truth for our Country!! Pay Attention !!
2392 2018-07-12 18:58:16 I am hoping the coverage of Bitcoin will die as quickly. Not sure if any other stock/currency/commodity gets this much attention. Even Oil is spoken about less than Bitcoin.
2393 2018-07-12 18:58:12 I have fried eggs (w olive oil) and guacamole on top with some salt and pepper for flavour today. Gorgeous.
2394 2018-07-12 18:58:09 My soon to be mother in law just started me on natural oils and I’ve gone from yeah okay to YES HELLO PLEASE about this oil thing. Haha #smelllikeheaven #nuturaloils #hipster
2395 2018-07-12 18:58:05 Bald? Cool.
You can always apply Olive Oil when you are about to sleep. And massage your head, so as to open your follicles. And when you do, make sure you head is rested, for blood flow. Dudddeeee, I hope you understand.
2396 2018-07-12 18:58:05 just got chili oil in my eye how’s your day going
2397 2018-07-12 18:58:03 Welcome to the oilfield where one day you are perfecting how to lean on a shovel. The next you’re inside a 110 degree oil tank cleaning it out
2398 2018-07-12 18:58:00 I’d threaten to yelp them if they don’t give you a discount on oil changes for the year

2400 2018-07-12 18:57:54 Next time just spend the money to come to Itasca! Lol Jimmy won't charge you, all you gotta do is buy the oil for the change.
2401 2018-07-12 18:57:45 @FoxNews I’d like to understand fr t Ds how calling out Germany 4 buying oil fr RU is @POTUS supporting & doing a solid 4 RU. Shld Germany buy oil fr US which is DJT position wld significantly hurt RU economy. How do t Ds miss that fact? @LacyClayMO1
2402 2018-07-12 18:57:40 Everybody be asking what I put in my natural hair but lately it’s only been condioner and oil. My hair does the best with less preducts.
2403 2018-07-12 18:57:25 Me : *carrying 3 plates*

Table of 10 : ”eeeh I think you’ve missed like 7 of us :)))”

Me with my two arms : (((: “yes I am so sorry I’m just going to get the rest of your food now”

Table of ten : “oh and can we have mayo? And some sweet chilli chipotle lemon oil?!”

:))
2404 2018-07-12 18:57:11 Trump blasts Germany for their energy independence on Russia, does anyone know of another country that could build a pipeline to tidewater and supply Germany with oil?
2405 2018-07-12 18:57:10 My hair was so dry just now .. I had to go get some coconut oil
2406 2018-07-12 18:57:01 garage is best, i’ll have the rose petals and oil ready ;)
2407 2018-07-12 18:56:44 Agree on no interest in $100 oil. Not good for anyone really
2408 2018-07-12 18:56:39 So theyre not going to use plastics or paints or anything else that uses oil?
2409 2018-07-12 18:56:34 Try adding a few drops of an essential oil?
2410 2018-07-12 18:56:32 That makes me want to cry  lol why couldn’t I have been in Itasca! I’ve NEVER had to pay so much for an oil change. Isaac looked up where i went and under their reviews it said they take advantage of women on pricing 
2411 2018-07-12 18:56:10 oh my god I'm laughing lex, I like feel bad that you find all your boyfriends at the dump but they're all so fucking absurd and unique garbage it's kind of magical?? like beautiful rainbows on oil slicks
2412 2018-07-12 18:56:07 Many think FFP is to promote healthy financial performance by clubs. But the truth is, its a barrier to entry for big money to come in and become a competitor to the big clubs. Chelsea & City are examples of this. much smaller until Roman and the Sheik Mansour came in with oil $
2413 2018-07-12 18:55:59 Actually like Korea our troops are sacrificial lambs. In a first strike invasion, what would be first targets? IMO cost of forward deployed troops outweighs deterrence effect.
2414 2018-07-12 18:55:45 Well Russia is pretty close to all out (for a while), Kazak adds a little and no dates on NZone yet. My point is 2019 will be tight yet again. If oil goes into the $60s and stays past US mid-term elections, you can bet that Saudis will be pulling barrels out. $60s is a no-go
2415 2018-07-12 18:55:40 i'm in the same boat and straight tea tree oil has been helping too but again.... too slow...
2416 2018-07-12 18:55:35 Democracy and freedom?!? Try oil and gold. Republicans don't even give a crap about OUR democracy and freedom here at home. Merely their own power and wealth, and screw the people. Open your eyes.

2419 2018-07-12 18:55:18 Question- Does the seal oil pressure need to control or regulated during an #emergency #purge? 
Answer- Yes, this is critical! The first thing you are going to do in an emergency purge is drop the case pressure so the seal oil pressure drops to avoid flooding #generator w oil.
2420 2018-07-12 18:55:15 @trychemistry is there a visual difference or some other clear way to tell the difference between the oil in a Medihaze cart vs a 1971 cart?

Let’s say they were not returned to their little boxes and for some unrelated reason a person was a little forgetful. 

#AskingForAFriend
2421 2018-07-12 18:55:07 Of course oil "could" hit 100 over time but define that time period. 6 months? 1 year? 2 years? Give it a shot.
2422 2018-07-12 18:55:04 Commodities 

WTI Crude: (-0.23%) $70.17
Brent Oil: (+1.47%) $74.47

Silver: (+1.09%) $15.99
2423 2018-07-12 18:54:54 Trace it to Ralph bias boy. Gee I saved a lot of money cuz I didn't spend any. Subsequent PC GOVERNMENTS had to restart a road building program, build some hospitals, etc etc. PC's had $100 oil and pissed it. ND's had $30 oil. Get educated
2424 2018-07-12 18:54:53 As fun as it would be to troll the left, that's probably not gonna happen. I suggest a mural with maybe the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, founding fathers, national parks, or something like that.
2425 2018-07-12 18:54:52 YES & NO! OBAMA got '14 commitment to pay more-2% by '24 & they're DOING IT! This incls CURRENT INCREASES-NOT b/c of .@POTUS . To CLAIM this is ANOTHER LIE! SO, WHAT increases REALLY b/c of YOU? US $Bs NOT ONLY NATO but WORLD! PS. Germany to UR oil & gas b/c of YOUR TRADE WAR!
2426 2018-07-12 18:54:51 Sliiide some oil on me @ABSOlunacy
2427 2018-07-12 18:54:41 republicans continue to ignore everything (Russian hack, immigration, environment) and instead focus on their things (deportation, Investigating Hillary Clinton, oil drilling) and not letting democrats in it. and  they are enjoying it. this is why democrats need to be heard.
2428 2018-07-12 18:54:23 From my forthcoming book: Oil and God
Asads’ claim to legitimacy is 8 rigged referendums, in which they shamelessly crafted near 100% “yes”. Realistically, the two might have counted on 1/3 of votes. 
Today, with 2/3 of Syrians dead, injured & refugees, expect 20%.
2429 2018-07-12 18:54:19 I wonder about the role of education in this. Oil, at least in Texas, gives high school grads with a choice between college and a decent (if sometimes temporary) job on the rigs. Over time, this must adversely affect the education level of a region.
2430 2018-07-12 18:54:12 And you told me you know about the oil industry but don’t know what a rough neck is lol
Everyone knows a bullshitter, me thinks you are one
2431 2018-07-12 18:54:08 Smothered myself in cooking oil and sliding into dms like a racecar
2432 2018-07-12 18:54:06 Not talkin bout no lean, but we got that mud, I'm sellin oil.
2433 2018-07-12 18:53:58 @LacyClayMO1 Your comments at Strzok hearing take a very narrow view. If you don't think a country is influenced by where they get energy you are crazy. Ds have said for many years that USA in at mercy of Middle East bc of ur oil dependency. #trumpisright
2434 2018-07-12 18:53:44 I know he is a patriot. But he has to be concerned that Germany is jointly constructing an oil/gas pipeline with Russia for the purpose of buying Russian products for big money and the US is supposed to protect Germany from Russia for gratis. His comments are just stupid.
2435 2018-07-12 18:53:25 HVAC Twitter.... what's a good price w/ labor for a new AC Unit + Furnace, high efficiency (96%), + switching to Propane from Oil (heat) for 4200 sq. ft. house... I'm at $10,700 so far...
2436 2018-07-12 18:53:20 Very soon our oil refineries will be switched from Iranian Crude to Saudi Wahhabi Crude
2437 2018-07-12 18:53:11 Yeah telling Germany they are wrong buying Russian oil is a great embrace of Putin.
2438 2018-07-12 18:53:04 Warm summer nights are perfect for a cool refreshing entree like our Seared Ahi Tuna - sesame crusted sashimi grade Ahi tuna, micro green & pickled onion salad, ponzu sauce, and extra virgin olive oil! Add a frosty cocktail and A/C and you can see the weekend from here...
2439 2018-07-12 18:52:50 For a socialist I don’t understand why you don’t get that they need to pay their fair share!! It seems you only want your fair share from taxpayers but not the morons are taking oil from Russia but want us to pay for their protection from Russia. You read a friggin history book!
2440 2018-07-12 18:52:48 Where do we get our oil from fella ? N that pipeline deal was made 10 +yrs ago when Russia wasn’t invading countries. When the sanctions r lifted you’ll be on ur knees still slurping like the brainwashed traitor u r. Later
2441 2018-07-12 18:52:37 You best bet it to spray/ wet your hair everyday with water and then put a sealant oil like black castor the only real moisturizer is water
2442 2018-07-12 18:52:36 You hate pizza??...
I gotta remake my favorite mussel pizza from Sorriso in DC it’s delicious!
Cheese, tomato sauce, basil probably, olive oil lol
2443 2018-07-12 18:52:20 I'm getting my oil changed and my car is a wreck to say the least and I didn't clean it before.. these people are gonna hate me lmao .. 
2444 2018-07-12 18:52:14 No. It’s a carrier oil and i get cold pressed, so besides the great SPF factor, it definitely absorbs well and improves skin overall. I used it on my face with no issues or breakouts and that’s always the big test for me
2445 2018-07-12 18:52:13 I can appreciate not wanting to consume meat as a moral or personal issue but we can't then switch to an equally unsustainable model or worse. Some of those football fields are converted into vegan palm oil plantations, decimating orangutan populations

2448 2018-07-12 18:51:48 Ugh loved thd rose one! I know they made a foaming oil in the rose scent and Omg I'm obsessed with it. Got it on the 75% off sale for like $5.
2449 2018-07-12 18:51:47 100 traders can have 100 different opinions looking at the same chart. Your millage may vary but if you can't see it, I can't help you. My point is too many "experts" pumping 100 oil yet it sold off over 6.

2462 2018-07-12 18:50:43 So you guys put so much oil on your face and take pictures and caption it “glowing”?
2463 2018-07-12 18:50:41 I don't like the smell of castor oil but I'm trying to repair my hair 
2464 2018-07-12 18:50:36 Gotta love the Dems bringing up Germany/Russia.  Why didn’t the Dems KNOW about that little oil agreement?
2465 2018-07-12 18:50:35 Theatre Popcorn is cooked in Coconut oil and has enough sodium to put most people way over their days limit for sodium. Adding the second layer of grease such as butter or margarine is a high fat content (which most don't think about). 6/6 I could keep going but I have class in10
2466 2018-07-12 18:50:22 Ummm, not paying fair share destabilizes the union. Also Germany buying 70% of it's energy from the union's main opposition weakens the union. How can Germany stand up to Russia? What happens when Russia decides to cut off gas and oil to Germany in January?
2467 2018-07-12 18:50:12 Europe’s patronage of Russia’s #energy sector makes them the country's greatest #sponsors and the #POTUS expressed a clear desire to change that. This move could potentially both strengthen #NATO’s unity as well as open up a new market for US oil. #dailynews #earn2trade #crudeoil
2468 2018-07-12 18:50:08 @neverz_attic has great jewellery and accessories and the best oil perfumes. Top notch service too.
2469 2018-07-12 18:50:04 Absolutely Max! It is completely unfair that Quebec’s hydro revenue is not counted in their numbers but Alberta oil is. It’s total BS!!!
2470 2018-07-12 18:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2471 2018-07-12 18:49:59 Everytime I hear of one of these, I think of Erik Johnson ending his upcoming season stepping off a golf cart.
2472 2018-07-12 18:49:48 You do realise that this is in Oxfordshire, so nothing to do with the Met Police don't you? 
2473 2018-07-12 18:49:47 Might do oil swaps
2474 2018-07-12 18:49:41 Agreement is signed & sealed; 2% by 2024 & is based on GDP. It can't be changed. US buys oil frm Russia while shipping out 90% of US oil 2 foreign countries since they, not the US, own the pipelines. Hypocrisy at its finest. What's "not acceptable" is YOU advocating 4 Russia.
2475 2018-07-12 18:49:33 Some of you kids who are hitting College start coming up with ideas to get all our resources from America so that we don't have to go to war for oil and liquor. I start coming up with ideas to recycle old products.
2476 2018-07-12 18:49:32 Give us the full story, currently South Africa's main oil supplier is Saudi Arabia. "Nearly half (45%) comes from Saudi Arabia. A further 23% comes from Nigeria, 18% fromAngola, 4% from Ghana. Watch the Saudi Arabia percentage rise to more than 60% following this deal.
2477 2018-07-12 18:49:30 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
2478 2018-07-12 18:49:26 There's a dreamer born every minute and JS falls into that category. Even a broken closk is right twice a day, but JS's call on oil is so far worse than a broken clock. Wow, thats bad!!!
2479 2018-07-12 18:49:10 Yeah, 75% of my @IndyCar Fantasy lineup is sitting in that press conference. Always nice when you can support the #EhTeam and have a good chance of a solid points haul too!

2485 2018-07-12 18:48:10 Lol big time!
2486 2018-07-12 18:47:56 Car overheats as soon as I get back from changing the oil. Real life wouldn’t mind dying rn
2487 2018-07-12 18:47:55 And Trump published his "beautiful" letter from Kim.....and the US just asked the UN to cut off deliveries of refined oil products to North Korea.  I need a neck brace for my whiplash.
2488 2018-07-12 18:47:37 Criticism of Russian pipeline was priceless. Simple language that baffles others around the table.  Trump points out irony of being the biggest customer of your worst enemy.
Blank angry stares.

2491 2018-07-12 18:47:09 There is only one oil stock that is allowed to go up all the time. Can you guess?  Sins of omission for me on this one
2492 2018-07-12 18:47:05 I’m about to get so chunky in France and Spain this bitch gonna eat bread with olive oil breakfast lunch and dinner
2493 2018-07-12 18:46:59 Oh no! Not healthy lunches from a good company! Instead he should have put oil tycoons and Goldman Sacs in charge of foreign affairs, national security, and environmental protections! Lol
2494 2018-07-12 18:46:57 I was paraphrasing Donald, he saiD "Putin is not my enemy". If the US is not dependent on Russian oil then there is no reason to buy from them, yet they are.  Why?"
2495 2018-07-12 18:46:37 ‘West Qurna is one of Iraq's largest oil fields, located north of Rumaila field, west of Basra. West Qurna is believed to hold 21 billion barrels of recoverable reserves, making it the second largest field in the world after Saudi Arabia's Ghawar oil field.’ Ex the Google machine
2496 2018-07-12 18:46:16 It’s funny how ppl are complaining we banned plastic straws b4 assault rifles, oil pipelines, etc instead of praising the progress. I swear some live to complain!
2497 2018-07-12 18:46:13 you were my cup of tea, but i drink motor oil now 
2498 2018-07-12 18:45:54 Today's lunch: leftover bulgogi. A "salad" (smoked salmon, bell peppers, onions, iceberg lettuce, cabbage, mayo, avocado, white peppercorn, salt, msg, sugar, rice and white vinegar, and sesame oil) made me have 3 bowls of rice (6 servings, my bowls are large lol). SO DELICIOUS.
2499 2018-07-12 18:45:49 Natural resources minister says in the above (June 2018) "The number and capability of exploration companies involved is a welcome development and hopefully we will see an increase in drilling and the realisation of our oil and gas potential in the coming years."  2/3

2502 2018-07-12 18:45:44 Khazakstan and Russia are bringing at least 1 mill bpd on new supply. Add another 0.5 mill bpd from the Neutral Zone. Pumping technology has improved also in the rest of the World. There is little interest in 100 oil - even in the US. Oil is rather going down to around 60.

2506 2018-07-12 18:45:29 And GargaC should be sent to a maulana or a padri to get his ass treated without applying any oil.
2507 2018-07-12 18:45:28 We must always remember the importance and value of human life! Why oh why do we forget that every time there is shortage of money, oil or when a matter it’s not concerning your baby or brother...#historyrepeatsitself #areweevergoingtolearn?!
2508 2018-07-12 18:45:13 1/3 of our oil comes from Latin America and the Middle East that you want protection from. It is just how things go. Maybe Germany should quit oil and buy blankets?
2509 2018-07-12 18:45:10 my girl soaks in water first... gets it bubbling to get all the gunk soft and easy to clean out. then DON'T FORGET the olive oil... gotta scrub the salt in the pan with olive oil. seasoned pan status

2512 2018-07-12 18:44:56 Also you can use salt to clean up oil you spill on the floor or other hard to clean surfaces, instead of spreading it around.
2513 2018-07-12 18:44:51 I have 11 burns from the oil from making breakfast I’m never going by a stove again
2514 2018-07-12 18:44:50 The sticky latex when you cut a jackfruit! Gets all over the hands and plates, have to use oil to get it off, scrub hard, and then soap multiple times to get the oil off. But a perfect jackfruit is so worth it.
2515 2018-07-12 18:44:45 This tea tree oil in this stuff feels sooo soothing on my scalp.
2516 2018-07-12 18:44:44 My deep fryer uses so much oil 
2517 2018-07-12 18:44:42 The tweet is just meant to be funny and relatable. We get that “can you cook” line from every dude we meet and it’s exhausting. I’m 100% sure y’all would feel the same way if every girl asked could you change oil and y’all barely know eachother lol
2518 2018-07-12 18:44:42 Just came out and perceived palm oil beans from my neighbors flat. I feel like I'm floating. I must marry a Yoruba woman. If it's just for this beans alone it's okay
2519 2018-07-12 18:44:38 Opera sounds better without oil. We're calling on @royaloperahouse to end their partnership with climate criminals BP #bpbigscreens #fossilfreelondon #artnotoil"

2524 2018-07-12 18:44:26 When do our allies pay their fair share. Germany refusing to put an army in the field. Also contracting-out to NATO's geopolitical enemy Russia for natural gas and oil. Stabbing the United States in the back. It's time to raise tariffs on Germany.

2528 2018-07-12 18:43:40 You do know due to the constant onslaught of lobbying against renewables it is difficult to actually find any story where gas and oil are necessary when they have made legislation to prevent any other energy options? Is it really a choice when forced to do it??
2529 2018-07-12 18:43:39 This used to happen to me until I stopped using skin care products on my eyes!!! Switched from my trusted eye cream to using only coconut oil to remove my eye makeup. My eyes stopped watering throughout the day... it could be your skin care, even if it’s for “sensitive skin”
2530 2018-07-12 18:43:30 Yes yes!
I always remember my dad coming shopping with me and how I had to explain that I couldn't afford to buy cruelty free, farm happy chicken or check all my products for palm oil.
2531 2018-07-12 18:43:26 jamaican black castor oil!
2532 2018-07-12 18:43:22 Dear uninformed cretin. The United States spends $300 billion a year on importing oil from overseas, mostly from countries that hate us. So what’s your point?
2533 2018-07-12 18:43:14 That's because you're narrow minded Mike.  You some how think by not building a  pipeline that you're stopping the transportation of oil.  But what you really are is a promoter of shipping oil by truck, train and ship!  Your plan is to worsen the carbon footprint? Great job!

2535 2018-07-12 18:42:44 I was scrolling through my timeline so fast that when I saw this I was like, "Wow, hold up let me go back that oil painting had so much good texture to it."
2536 2018-07-12 18:42:28 My sister is taking my car to get the oil changed so I don’t have to leave the hospital. Sometimes she has a good soul.
2537 2018-07-12 18:42:22 It's a well thought out model but I think the way you measure 'potential positive developments' shouldn't be limited to activities within ME but also external countries who hold significant stake in those trigger points. Also, map can include natural gas/oil/metals supply sites.
2538 2018-07-12 18:41:48 I'll tell you what freaked me out as a kid, certainly once. I think I was ill with a fever but I watched Popeye. It was Olive Oil, she creeped me out, the way she moved about and I went to bed and remember thinking about it and then just screaming for my mum because I was scared.

2540 2018-07-12 18:41:44  He blocked me last year but I can see from another account he's asked you "Why are you being so rude". Tell him to grow a thicker skin. He get butthurt so easily. He would be best to ignore lots of stuff and concentrate on selling snake oil to suckers.
2541 2018-07-12 18:41:40 He did get something, he got a commitment from Bush to give the UN route one more go. Unfortunately because u r a Murdoch puppet u don’t know this. UN didn’t work because Saddam bought France off with promises of oil.
2542 2018-07-12 18:41:36 i don't know whether living in new york for a year has made me more suggestible or naive, but suddenly paltrow's bs oil pulling and egg steaming techniques are sounding like legitimate options.

2544 2018-07-12 18:41:20 The only deregulation we have had is telecommunications. What we had in the power sector was  nothing but scam and continued monopoly while there appears no seriousness to deregulate OIL SECTOR. CSOs can help to restart the pressure on NASS on PIB. It's so sad

2549 2018-07-12 18:40:59 Just gently hose them off. The most organic way to control them is to buy some lady bugs and put them all over the garden/plant area. Neem oil works, but it’s actually not the best thing to do.
2550 2018-07-12 18:40:58 Yeah, the German/Russian oil argument would sound good if it didn't come from the hypocrite that was elected by and is beholden to the Russians. It smells funny.

2572 2018-07-12 18:38:23 If we keep bleeding this money to the US, the Canadian economy will become a "have not" economy. Oil is not sustainable as well and when that goes, there aren't much left. Spotify, amazon, google, FB is great but the long term profits go to the US economy, not Canadian.

2574 2018-07-12 18:38:08 What does NATO have to do with buying oil from Russia?! NATO is a collision of countries that have pledged to defend each other.
You sure need to be schooled in history!
2575 2018-07-12 18:37:57 So one more question: to  your knowledge is carrot oil known for clogging pores, like some oils do?
2576 2018-07-12 18:37:57 I don't think so some are already generating synthetic fuel and oil from cheaper coal and natural gas but the price of petrol remains controlled by the mafia state to accommodate those who use crude oils. My opinion not my employer...
2577 2018-07-12 18:37:54 I’m so lucky I got next to no stretch marks when I was pregnant.. I smothered myself in bio oil everyday 
2578 2018-07-12 18:37:54 Might be aphids. Try neem oil.

2580 2018-07-12 18:37:28 Then why is Germany wanting our protection while they make oil deals with Russia?
2581 2018-07-12 18:37:27 Oh, and (in pursuing those oil sanctions) the US is looking for cooperation from allies it keeps alienating with trade sanctions and rhetorical bluster, e.g. NATO countries, Canada, and China. So the U.N. ambassador's job now involves smoothing over that stupidity too.
2582 2018-07-12 18:37:15 On the side of a bottle of Garlic Salt you will find that it is 20-40% sodium depending on the brand! And then many people add salt in their recipe! Throw the salt free oil/becel and Granulated Garlic in when you start your Saute and salt when it hits your plate...4/?..

AND
Worldwide, around 92.6 million barrels of oil were produced daily in 2017. 
Now go see how that gels with the artcle.
Hint: It does not.

2632 2018-07-12 18:33:01 I drink coffee everyday on keto amiga. Just not Starbucks. I sweeten it with stevia.  Sometimes I make a keto bomb with real butter, coconut oil and stevia. I check myself daily with ketosticks to see if I'm in ketosis.
2633 2018-07-12 18:32:58 the way i hate caster oil ,i preferred them making me drink it when i was asleep

2635 2018-07-12 18:32:38 I support women who are fans of wrestling because they love the wrestling. Or the storytelling. Or the personalities. Or the baby oil slathered all over Finn's abs. Or the Hiromu/Despy fan fiction. Or literally any other reason.
2636 2018-07-12 18:32:35 Forget prices there's no way to figure out if the oil is extra virgin or not.
2637 2018-07-12 18:32:30 Tea tree oil and always keeping it moisturized
2638 2018-07-12 18:32:15 He ain’t got a choice but to oil these babies and get them angles 
2639 2018-07-12 18:32:08 If you’re a guy and you don’t know how to change oil or the average mileage to change oil, you’re trash.
2640 2018-07-12 18:32:05 @RepSteveChabot Trump was a despicable candidate Being sued by everyone. Sexual assault allegations. You have all been taken to the gutter and you go willingly. That makes you deplorable as well. #WITCHHUNT spelled #REPUBLICAN.  NRA, Pharma, Oil buys the Republicans
2641 2018-07-12 18:32:01 This white paper is not Brexit who going to step up,help our country  some has to stop this!! @BorisJohnson @patel4witham @DavidDavisMP @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @LiamFox
2642 2018-07-12 18:32:00 However If Europe is under Russian threat.. Why did Germany give millions for Russian oil?  Really!!!!!
2643 2018-07-12 18:31:34 I need to date a mechanic I just spent way to fucking much on a synthetic oil change.

2647 2018-07-12 18:31:05 The government of Azerbaijan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Justin Long in a osnaburg wig.
2648 2018-07-12 18:31:01 Oil, crude oil my brother, I wonder why oil community are always neglected
2649 2018-07-12 18:30:38 Brahmins never considered Sudra-ati sudra as "Hindu" but now want to impose Hindu Rashtra.. Supremacist power groups use religion as mask. ISIS is political front used for oil wars of west- so bringing that in waste
2650 2018-07-12 18:30:37 Oooh, thank you! I was actually looking at Avocado oil and apricot oil. I'll look into Scottish fine soaps

2654 2018-07-12 18:30:22 Oil (=/+): Rising production from Middle East Gulf countries and Russia, welcome though it is, comes at expense of world’s spare-capacity cushion, which might be stretched to limit. This vulnerability currently underpins oil px and seems likely to continue doing so - IEA
2655 2018-07-12 18:30:19 straight from the oil fields
2656 2018-07-12 18:30:15 Drink Castor Oil like on Stand By Me so you can "payback" the other contestants if they beat you?
2657 2018-07-12 18:30:10 Let the grind begin 
2658 2018-07-12 18:30:05 The US effectively banned using oil and natural gas in power plants (later repealed) right around Three Mile Island time, and that’s a big part of why we have a ton of coal infrastructure from that era
2659 2018-07-12 18:30:02 There’s always a silver lining I just love how you’re nice and tanned with your factor 50 and you boyf used bloody carrot oil! Literally burning himself to a bloody crisp

2662 2018-07-12 18:29:50 Probably some oil on that line as well. Pipelines + Carbon Taxes = reduced emissions?
2663 2018-07-12 18:29:46 So what does a lack of sufficient oil reflect? That’s the point, I think.
2664 2018-07-12 18:29:33 Sour Diesel Oil >>>>>>>
2665 2018-07-12 18:29:11 The MSM is so powerful. They can take a great man like Trump that gave up running his businesses to save America & define him as a racist. MSM is paid for by the elites that make money from the insurance companies, pharmaceuticals & big oil, ect. Politicians go in middle class...
2666 2018-07-12 18:29:11 Angolan production could be contracted out to others for the longterm. Remember, the oil majors are running the show with their countries' security of supply being their main priority.
2667 2018-07-12 18:29:10 たぶんこれなんですけど、宇宙で戦うPVのやつありませんでしたっけ？
2668 2018-07-12 18:29:03 1. There's still a lot about marketing we don't understand. Even with better attribution and assessment tools, some part of it is getting people to pay attention which is more art than science. As a result there's more space for snake oil (which tends to come with buzzwords).
2669 2018-07-12 18:28:59 One single drop of olive oil from a salad is now coating the space bar and every key around it.
2670 2018-07-12 18:28:58 I can truly say I’m blessed to have a man that does what mine does. I dont need the shopping trips (don’t mean I won’t take them) but instead I get the “your oil is changed, I replaced your brakes,etc.” everybody shows their love differently 
2671 2018-07-12 18:28:49 Oil and water.
2672 2018-07-12 18:28:40 @jimrome Weak retort Broadway Vic. You’re like the high school state quarterback making appearances at the local Buick dealership to sell oil changes. #rickinbuffalo
2673 2018-07-12 18:28:35 Service update: current wait aprox. 2 hours. Oil change done & emissions testing happening now; had to wait for a certified person to be free to do it. ETA: 30 min. Hunger level: hungry, verging on hangry; controlled by distraction of being at climax of the book I am reading
2674 2018-07-12 18:28:35 I feel it!! Especially now with the glossier trend with all the girls WHo lOoK like GodessEs CoVered in baby oil. It’s a long journey for sure!!! I hope you find what works for you!!! I know it’s hard to stay confident but I’m sending all my love ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡

2677 2018-07-12 18:28:23 How to get the most use out of your acrylic paints:
-put them up
-take out your oil ones
-please use those instead acrylic is so hard
2678 2018-07-12 18:28:19 These 3 older white East Cobb ladies just discussed the wonderful blessing of Castor oil. 1 was like “it grew my eyelashes so now I put it on my eyebrows and my hair!”
2679 2018-07-12 18:28:19 We could have deregulated oil industry and make it prosper. But seems Nigeria waits on Alhaji and when he is ready, Nigeria will be ready. Then, the true cost of fuel appears, expensive. 2020
2680 2018-07-12 18:28:09 Three Cheers for Exxon. Exxon has always been a responsible oil company and this is another reason it is showing its responsibnility in an age where Trump & Republicans are so foolishly denying environmental harm with not need for controls. Kudos Exxon!
2681 2018-07-12 18:27:46 No, the man is plainly a vulgar snake oil salesman, with such a high level of business acumen he even made a casino go bankrupt!! He is also deep in hock to Putin. Not to be trusted
2682 2018-07-12 18:27:42 โห งั้นนอนดีกว่าค่ะไม่ปั่นแล้ว แสดงว่าแค่ดีดให้ไม่หลับแต่สมองนี่หลับไปแล้ว  /จะพยายามนะคะ พอมีคนรอก็ชอบเป็นแบบนี้ค่ะ กดดันตัวเองเฉยเลย แงงง ขอบคุณออบมากนะคะ ;_;
2683 2018-07-12 18:27:39 Oh wait a minute! Airlines raised there prices the last time fuel was expensive and failed to lower them when the price of oil crashed.  It is the only industry that can treat there customers like shit and the customer returns!
2684 2018-07-12 18:27:23 But a certain big petroleum company is generating synthetic fuel and oil from coal and natural gas they don't need that oil
2685 2018-07-12 18:27:22 プラチナ遠ない？
2686 2018-07-12 18:27:08 Interesting. Do you look into anything to do with palm oil?
2687 2018-07-12 18:26:55 Still the old way of milling palm oil?!
2688 2018-07-12 18:26:42 Believe it or not, cannabis is illegal is most countries, such as mine. Even a kid who suffers with extreme epilepsy got his CBD oil taken off him. People seek help in different ways. But I never mentioned anti depressants because I never spoke about that.. i was talking about
2689 2018-07-12 18:26:37 NO GIRL..... I don't see where he got his ass beat.  I see where he swung on Pedro's punk ass and tripped over his big TRANNY, OLIVE OIL SISTER, Nicole..

2690 2018-07-12 18:26:30 Just finished re-watching yesterday's Nadal - del Potro battle and not surprisingly, it was just as entertaining the second time through. Nothing quite like a top-level tennis match between two greats at a Slam.  #Wimbledon
2691 2018-07-12 18:26:22 ''Thank you!''

The puppies deserve some pats.
2692 2018-07-12 18:26:22 I agree that the balance of evidence is against the view that skill shortages are a major problem, but high frequency movements in real wages can be driven by things like oil prices that have nothing to do with the labor market, so I don't buy your logic.
2693 2018-07-12 18:25:29 That works wonders. Especially castor oil, ideally cold pressed. it's super dense and your eyes close in gratitude.
2694 2018-07-12 18:25:23 Used my woman privilege and wore a dress, assuring I do not have to climb up in that dirty ass oil skimmer to find the serial number on the tube.

2696 2018-07-12 18:25:22 In 2017, The PGR reveals that 628 PEMEX employees are implicated in the theft of gas and oil by-products.
2697 2018-07-12 18:25:20 With Trump it has and always will be about what is in it for him. Trump Moscow? Oil and mineral rights? Copyrights in China and Russia? He admires authoritarians and wants the same type of power. He is dangerous.

How would you magic away the gap between what we raise and what we spend, and dont say oil. Have you even read the GCR? Its all there in black and white.
2706 2018-07-12 18:24:14 We buy our oil in Saudi  Arabia.

2709 2018-07-12 18:23:45 Strategic goods like oil, gas, and uranium do not necessarily follow  a supply and demand logic as they can be used as weapons as well, geopolitical weapons.

2715 2018-07-12 18:23:20 Perhaps you should look in the mirror you hack “opinion” writer doing the bidding for Hedge Funds and Pro Oil states like Russia!
2716 2018-07-12 18:23:14 I’m glad I did an oil treatment on my hair last night. This is the first day it’s not frizzy and curly in this humid ass rainforest bitch weather.
2717 2018-07-12 18:23:11 In reading your posts you seem to ignore the world around you and pay attention only to talking points. Have you heard Poland gets natural gas from America? Have you heard Russian oil deliveries are down? How about Russia in Syria...have you heard?
2718 2018-07-12 18:23:11 It was the launch of the new Portofino.
 Mine was slightly out the picture in red.
2719 2018-07-12 18:23:08 Mara why can't SA buy oil from Nigeria since they are the nearest and do produce  crude oil?

2721 2018-07-12 18:22:56 Well Seth imagine a country using America to protect them from Russia while giving Russia billions of dollars for oil— instead of buying oil from its allies
2722 2018-07-12 18:22:52 The same way cooking oil is called saladi by some Zambians
2723 2018-07-12 18:22:25 The only time the NATO Article 5 was evoked was by the US after 9/11. Then parlayed into an unfounded Iraq war so companies like Haliburton could money grab the oil resources. Leading to a weaker alliance. Corporate greed will start the next World War
2724 2018-07-12 18:22:20 Fish oil is something that you see when you go to Costco.

2726 2018-07-12 18:22:05 I asked myself why EU companies snapped up Greek ports - after it defaulted on EU loans. Turns out, they are high traffic ports for ships carrying oil from the East, passing through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean, en route to European markets.

They see something here too.
2727 2018-07-12 18:21:54 How about a fetish for crying into harsh oil spills under cars, don't tell mom!

2734 2018-07-12 18:21:26 Sad that soon the whole United States will become a condemned dead zone oil patch like the Gulf of Mexico.  Forget game of thrones or hunger games this looks like Soylent Green.

2737 2018-07-12 18:21:07 India is buying more US crude to make up for shortfalls from US sanctions on Iran. He'll credit himself with boosting the American oil industry, but the truth is, the sales are a by-product of extraordinarily corrupt tactics. One more example of how he is cancer personified.
2738 2018-07-12 18:20:58 Cosmo o apereng okare ba mo tshetse ka cooking oil ya China so? #GenerationsTheLegacy
2739 2018-07-12 18:20:52 Cancelling the accord allowed Trump to institute harsh sanctions on Iranian oil, which is why there’s now a shortage on the world market and the cost of oil and gas has gone up, and why Trump has had to beg Saudi Arabia to increase production.
2740 2018-07-12 18:20:51 Agree with most but a currency is useless if you cannot use it to exchange goods or services otherwise it becomes a commodity like gold or a valuable oil painting or a hash you can put on the wall.

2752 2018-07-12 18:19:51 Sure, it is a derivative, but it is not fish oil. Just thought we should be accurate, wouldn't want to mislead people.
2753 2018-07-12 18:19:48 Only because it's believed that everywhere that is is cheap to extract oil will have been exhausted by 2040. Until 2040 it isn't forecast to be above $100. And didn't Salmond base the white paper on it being like $150 anyway?
2754 2018-07-12 18:19:35 @CraigPolizzi loves to lather himself up in oil, use melted bars of soap as shoes, and slide up to women who are grocery shopping and say “Now Baby ain’t this better than sliding into yo DM’s?”  #TheBoomaSlide #YEAHHHHHH

2765 2018-07-12 18:18:47 What crisis was started Norm? The fact that most NATO countries want protection from Russia then rely on Russian oil. Does that make any sense considering Russia can cut off the supply at anytime and wipe them out

He’s not worried about Russia investigation, he’s worried about all the other criminal activities uncovered thru it
2767 2018-07-12 18:18:43 Okay, tell me WHY i went to a @76 gas station and my receipt said UNITED OIL!!!!???!!
2768 2018-07-12 18:18:43 Take Trump out of this. If it was anyone else this whole thing stinks. Pretending the level of bias we all know existed didn't affect actions at all ignores human nature.
2769 2018-07-12 18:18:23 This is not difficult! Trump & his backers both in the US and Russia profit from conflict. They profit from the build up  snd sales of arms. They also profit from oil and gas prices increasing.  Putin gets a narrative to feed to his people. Arms dealers get richer.

2772 2018-07-12 18:18:12 We buy 47% of our oil from them
2773 2018-07-12 18:18:07 I'd also pledge billions when you raping the bloody people with your oil prices
2774 2018-07-12 18:18:05 Not to mention Gvmt *opposition* to 2017-2018 bills to stop issue of Oil/Gas exploration licences ... and subsequent "ramping up" of those efforts it seems .  Can @think_or_swim comment?  2/2

2777 2018-07-12 18:17:35 He's a resister. I don't understand what I did? Just because I use Uber, I'm now scum! Is that any worse than people who drive and buy gas from Exxon or any other big oil corps? 
90% of the time, I walk or take the bus. 
Wtf?
2778 2018-07-12 18:17:34 There seems to be enough oil on inbred Gowdy’s face to fry a bucket of chicken.
2779 2018-07-12 18:17:32 Gowon agreed to let the East go in an Aburi accord. The Britanians knowing the igbos for who we are, fibally thought it wise to tell the Nigerian government. Thats was the time Gowon went back on the Aburi agreement. Because letting the East go means the oil gone too
2780 2018-07-12 18:17:31 Yeah that's great, the question isnt how good Yorgos Litmustest olive oil test, it was do Hollywood/Ire land still produce weird movies. 

And the answer is Yourghost.
2781 2018-07-12 18:17:30 A rare voice of mine is  "knowledgeable tough guy at express oil change place." It's just Vin Diesel doing Brando.
2782 2018-07-12 18:17:20 Well the #troopcarrier needs some love so I’m gonna giver her some.   Oil change, lube front end and maybe a lil dyi plastic refresh might go down.   #n8zfab #vanlove #vanlife #offthewall  @ N8Z FAB
2783 2018-07-12 18:17:09 So dumbass, if your theory holds true, that makes the US controlled by everyone we buy oil from? You are such a fucking moron

2796 2018-07-12 18:15:50 Caveat emptor crude oil bulls!!
2797 2018-07-12 18:15:50 So I'm sitting in the car dealership getting an oil change with a tube top on of course no bra and pink hair with my long ghetto nails and these white mans are losing their minds looking at me  I guess I'm making them uncomfortable 
2798 2018-07-12 18:15:38 To @ra_fun ‘s point, all fish oil are not created equal and would then be on other players to prove they are or at least convince prescribers/patients they are close enough.  $AMRN may have a first mover advantage if they can show positive CVOT while other trials wait to read out
2799 2018-07-12 18:15:31 It’s probably not drugs, but oil and gas money. Laundered into real estate Trump has plenty of.
2800 2018-07-12 18:15:24 It’s less then a month till my birthday and Jenna comes for a visit ! 
I will be soaking in coconut oil and praying to all gods to make my skin clear, if anyone is looking for me 
2801 2018-07-12 18:15:21 In 2017, Oil field auction day.  The gvmt auctions 21 of 24 onshore oil and gas blocks as part of energy sector reforms.
2802 2018-07-12 18:15:16 The irrational concern about Venezuela, Iran, Libya, and a shortage of crude oil as well as the talk of little spare capacity for crude in OPEC is totally hype by crude oil bulls. We see this as their last hurrah.

2804 2018-07-12 18:15:14 The least you can do if you riding around in your girls car is make sure the shit is all set like make sure there’s oil or fill the tank up here and there like little shit goes a long way...
2805 2018-07-12 18:15:08 What holds us back on oil & gas is getting it to market.  We then won't be selling to US at discount.   $70/barrel is a tidy profit for oil companies.  Getting it to market to get that price is the issue!
2806 2018-07-12 18:15:00 The European Commission downgraded its growth forecast for the #eurozone this year due to external factors such as US #tradeuncertainty and high oil prices, the Commission said Thursday in a statement.
2807 2018-07-12 18:14:54 Germany buys Russian oil.  Soon with be dependent on oil from them! Yet fake news says trumps treatment of NATO proves he is a puppet! Fake news

2824 2018-07-12 18:13:38 But Gaddafi also led the African Union encouraging a move away from the almighty $, this too played a role towards his terrible fate and that of the jewel of Africa, Libya, oil wealthy, that shared with its people the benefits of resources wealth. Deemed a crime by NATO.
2825 2018-07-12 18:13:37 @aasian thoughts for grape seed oil as a moisturizer? I have oily skin, but also curious if it will help with acne scaring..
2826 2018-07-12 18:13:35 Yesterday crude oil fell sharply or by 5% to US$70.46/b for WTI. The main part of the move happened after the release of the weekly EIA data. The price drop was due to the following:
2827 2018-07-12 18:13:28 Mostly from ourselves now a days .  We export oil now.
2828 2018-07-12 18:13:24 Why does the U.S. import oil abroad, while still importing oil from abroad? To make the big oil companies a bundle, that's why. Brace yourself for massive gas price increases, while our government continues to sell us out.
2829 2018-07-12 18:13:18 Our way of life values the natural systems that provide for us. I can't say the same about you @GregForMontana. Since moving to our state you certainly haven't come to understand that the cultural and economic value of true wilderness trumps any amount of gold or oil. #mtsen

2833 2018-07-12 18:13:05 They could, if effort started years ago-eg. 2011. A big part of this is powerful tribes holding govt. to ransom, but also state led economy (which has only really been changed in oil+gas) needed to change long ago. It's not too late, if the news on electricity reform is correct.
2834 2018-07-12 18:13:04 those commercials with the animals getting oil washed off makes me so emotional
2835 2018-07-12 18:13:00 not when I gotta change my oil
2836 2018-07-12 18:12:46 Unfortunately, oil is needed to manufacture not just EVs but most goods. It's also used for mining and shipping.
2837 2018-07-12 18:12:39 Complying with US sanctions on Iran will increase demand for US oil while reducing Iran oil demand.. benefiting US in huge way. Someone's loss is someone's gain in the scarce oil market. What does India have in this ? Is US gonna reduce its oil prices for India ? #IranSanctions
2838 2018-07-12 18:12:04 Someone tell this fucking Purple man mineral oil is not edible outside of being a laxative in small amounts. LOL
2839 2018-07-12 18:12:02 Poverty in Canada isn’t hiding anymore, it’s your neighbour, it’s your siblings, it’s your parents, it’s everywhere. It can almost certainly be you with increasing interest rates, govt tax, service fees for erroneous purposes, and energy costs that rival the oil crisis circa 70’s
2840 2018-07-12 18:11:55 Oil is needed to make EVs.
2841 2018-07-12 18:11:53 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2842 2018-07-12 18:11:53 i wish i would’ve woken up sooner, i wanted my oil change today

2845 2018-07-12 18:11:30 Bih can’t even afford an oil change
2846 2018-07-12 18:11:26 Yeah, I know the medical data quite well. Point of previous link: I used to be a big fish oil fan. Now I have lots of equipoise. But I'm glad you guys are so interested in Adam's thing!
2847 2018-07-12 18:11:14 Thanks for sharing. Would be good to know what the new "framework" is or should be. EM reeling from strong $, which has been driven by 1) the impact on USTs of expected Fed hikes and higher oil, 2) impact of #tradewar on risk appetite (current driver). Weaker trend $ = EM rebound
2848 2018-07-12 18:11:06 The bar is getting so low, we'll soon need oil drilling equipment to get to it.
2849 2018-07-12 18:11:03 Unfortunately, oil is needed to manufacture EVs, as well as the infrastructure needed to use them.
2850 2018-07-12 18:11:01 I know it’s difficult to spare even a modest amount of outrage these days, but I feel like we never had a national conversation about how oil changes now cost $90.
2851 2018-07-12 18:10:58 My cocunut oil spilled in my bag and it looks like i have fucking permanent pit stains
2852 2018-07-12 18:10:46 Spent my entire lunch getting an oil change and now I don’t have time to get lunch. Somebody bring me an avocado and a cucumber please.
2853 2018-07-12 18:10:41 The oil that Germany is purchasing from Russia is cheaper than the LNG from US. Germany has said it would make their companies uncompetitive if the expenses increase.
2854 2018-07-12 18:10:41 @Thehairstop_ confirm hair, @Lamyy__ trust to have good skin, full beards. @Don_Sheffy good shirts,sneakers, native for men too  etc @dejokecarew oil perfume. Very good ones. Bukola does mugs,pillow forgotten her handle.

It’s becoming painfully clear that the way forward for global oil markets is going to be bumpy, very bumpy, particularly as we head into next year... Much of this uncertainty, even blame, is being increasingly leveled at one person...
2865 2018-07-12 18:09:47 Head up, Mineral oil is used as a laxative. Also not positive if you can or should cook with it. Is there anything you have read that says otherwise?
2866 2018-07-12 18:09:43 Dude is mad about the Iraq War still (lol), and is even more tone deaf about the reasons why he lost his goddamned hand.

He was a bitch to oil and neocons, but he still blames The Dems, lmao
2867 2018-07-12 18:09:41 you can’t really fuck up an oil change. you either know what you doing or you don’t.

2872 2018-07-12 18:09:25 Another upside to having to reduce fat in my diet is that I've discovered how delicious and filling the combination of spinach pasta, olive oil, parmesan, and peas is.
2873 2018-07-12 18:09:25 I purchased my car 18 months ago. Still have not reached the mileage for a first oil change. Odometer currently sitting at ~8,200 miles—3,000 of which are road trips to Bama. 

Should probably just sell the Toyota and purchase a few more bicycles. #Brompton #GiantBicycles

2875 2018-07-12 18:09:16 cancer is man made. USA holds patent for cure. Cannabis oil is proven cure. Alkheline diet is proven that cancer cannot survive. Cancer thrives in acidic diet thus we have sugar in everything. Theres tonnes of info if you look.

2877 2018-07-12 18:09:07 Primary reason of trade is to trade communities that the countries do not share a common. Example. Trading lumber for oil. 
Isn’t this trade setup only to buy cheaper products?
2878 2018-07-12 18:09:04 no not yet (fingers crossed) but neem oil is like the gnarliest thing that’s still natural 

The only other thing I can think of is to completely transplant the plant and keep up with all the soap/neem/rubbing alcohol treatments
2879 2018-07-12 18:08:59 So stupid, Mullah Regime can't take $350 mil from their own account in Germany, then hope Putin invest $50 with B in Iran...that's crazy as Qatar owned 19% of Russian state oil Company. believe Qatar sold some % recently, Russia has no cash for investment...simple

2887 2018-07-12 18:08:27 This whole Russian investigation driven by Dems is a plus for Putin beyond wildest expectations. All this division sown over some Facebook ads, and a few social media bots.

B) you might have to smoke that outside the house smells.
Grrr... On my nerves. So I sit outside in 100° heat
2892 2018-07-12 18:08:10 Why do we allow Canadian mining companies to purchase thousands of acres in Navajo /Apache County so they can frack for oil? Fracking is devastating to the water table, environment & Wild life . How can we stop this pillage and plunder of our beautiful land ?
2893 2018-07-12 18:07:51 Peak oil isn't about running out of oil.

-Spray yourself with water
(the sun is attracted to water)
-Wear a small bikini 
(so you don’t get large tan lines)
-Try using coconut oil!
(have personally tired & I love it!)
2897 2018-07-12 18:07:31 Hard to see how Putin’s puppet would be slamming Germany for buying RUS gas/oil.  It sounds like nearly all of NATO would miserably fail any kind of emergency readiness exercise. Trump is fighting for better defense.
2898 2018-07-12 18:07:26 Thats good.... Try to get rid from dependence of oil.
2899 2018-07-12 18:07:15 China is the threat not Russia, China is trying to take over Taiwan and the whole of the S China Sea with man made islands armed with deadly weapons! Turkey a NATO ally. Strong NATO cutting off oil to Germany to drain money from Putin is a good thing Shifty! Billions per year
2900 2018-07-12 18:07:08 I luv how dispite all this crap is happening, and yet the Stocks are still High today.... Goes to show none of this is real, and legit, and it's just A over glorified Casino for The SYdicates to Launder the Illegal fund,s and the OIl and  GAS Pigs to roll their money around.
2901 2018-07-12 18:07:06 Off-topic but when did we stop storing the Strategic Oil Reserve in Trey Gowdy's hair?
2902 2018-07-12 18:07:04 Pompeo in #UAE: America is committed to keeping sea lanes open, to keep transit of oil available for the entire world. 

بومبيو من #الإمارات: الولايات المتحدة ملتزمة بالإبقاء على خطوط الملاحة البحرية مفتوحة،  والمحافظة على تدفق النفط إلى كافة أنحاء العالم.
2903 2018-07-12 18:06:59 Some fuckwit thinked motor oil could be replaced by water weed what the fuck do I do w this car
2904 2018-07-12 18:06:57 If the voters  of Oklahoma would vote in people who will pass laws forcing the oil and gas companies  responsible this would not be occurring
2905 2018-07-12 18:06:47 Oil Kings haven't had the best of luck with players from Belarus, best take a wait & see approach.
2906 2018-07-12 18:06:46 Countries that go around invading other countries, instigating regime change, blowing children up for an oil pipe and making billionaires out of arms dealers. Yes, those countries probably need to spend 2% GDP on defense.
2907 2018-07-12 18:06:46 Hopefully it will oil on track or suchlike. Fingers crossed
2908 2018-07-12 18:06:45 That feeling of rejoice when, after a few boring bug tickets, you have one that is a bit more challenging and fun and will allow you to go and dig into a bit more "low level" stuff. It's like extra virgin olive oil for the engines of your brain... :P
2909 2018-07-12 18:06:41 First stop oil change, and then it’s omw to the taco truck
2910 2018-07-12 18:06:35 Peak oil per capita took place in 1979. Conventional production peaked in 2006. Shale's next.
2911 2018-07-12 18:06:35 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
2912 2018-07-12 18:06:22 Dr. Bronners peppermint soap, an ice cube to close my pores after washing and rosehip oil sis! If you have dry skin I suggest ponds moisturizer too!
2913 2018-07-12 18:06:11 Wrong. Cnn actually believes what it is saying.Alex is actually misleading on purpose just to sucker you out of your time and money. Making health claims that can not be proven. 

HE IS A MODERN SNAKE OIL SALESMAN! that's fraud. Not freedom of speech. He is knowingly misleading!
2914 2018-07-12 18:05:56 i remember in 7th grade i used to wear a big bun in my hair a lot until one day on the way to school my dad told me i looked like olive oil from popeye and i never wore a bun again lmaoo
2915 2018-07-12 18:05:55 เกมส์!!
2916 2018-07-12 18:05:54 I take CBD oil for my spasms. Such a relief. It's not the. It comes from the flower.
2917 2018-07-12 18:05:48 I don’t get why they make changing oil seem so hard at times maybe on old cars with the canister but it’s literally one screw on some cars.
2918 2018-07-12 18:05:37 Ohhh okay, sorry ahah I just put them with some oil and rosemary, don't know if there's a particular name for that. They turned out fine, I honestly expected worse :')
2919 2018-07-12 18:05:27 Why should India give up its decades of long standing oil trade relations with Iran ? US should tell viable and beneficial reasons. Why should India upheld US sanctions on Iran. What incentive India has by giving up good relations with Iran ? #IranSanctions
2920 2018-07-12 18:05:20 So Germany is getting oil from Russia?will soon be dependent on Russian oil.  Yet they give Trump a hard time with being to kind to a nuke power house! Get it! Get it! NATO owe for years! USA is only one pays 70%++ of NATO.  Get it! Get it!! Liberal hate is strong

2923 2018-07-12 18:05:05 Nanobot cameras have been installed in robotic birds. they look like real birds, but are really spies for Big Auto/Oil and looser shorts.
2924 2018-07-12 18:05:03 I was going to try avocado oil next time I ran out of olive oil myself.
2925 2018-07-12 18:04:37 Oil of oregano and Vit D !!! Will work wonders if you get good supplements and stick to em for a week or two.
2926 2018-07-12 18:03:57 Peak oil cannot be junk science for painfully obvious reasons.
2927 2018-07-12 18:03:54 Hahahaaaaahahaha
2928 2018-07-12 18:03:51 You are not thinking of the future, rather you are stuck in the past. Invest in the future! Oil is not the future!
2929 2018-07-12 18:03:40 .....the guy is 74 and retired.... must have some connections or skill set that’s valuable to being a producer
2930 2018-07-12 18:03:40 It's a beautiful day! Make it a little better with some #CBD oil. #hemp #heals #natural #healing #earth
2931 2018-07-12 18:03:32 Using oil instead of water?

2933 2018-07-12 18:03:02 Disappointing that a world leader would verbally attack another country for purchasing natural gas when the US has gone to war over oil reserves.
2934 2018-07-12 18:02:54 This white paper is not Brexit who going to step up,help our country  some has to stop this!! @BorisJohnson @patel4witham @DavidDavisMP @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @LiamFox
2935 2018-07-12 18:02:52 It wasn´t the oil shock that shook the world, but the Fed´s misguided reaction to it!
2936 2018-07-12 18:02:33 U.S. asks U.N. to cut off oil products to North Korea-Why would the UN mess with Trump's buddy Kim, they know he need his oil. Trump is gonna get rid of Haily next.
2937 2018-07-12 18:02:32 $SAEX Back to my original entry. I’m in 1.58 , Oil is surging
2938 2018-07-12 18:02:27 Cheese "food", the fake cheesy stuff they use in some products.  All the stickiness of regular cheese, but with the added benefit of being oil based and resistant to water.

But better question... Why does that person keep make the peanut butter sad?  Feelsbadman
2939 2018-07-12 18:02:21 At 2:00pm I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLQ18) and USO on my software.
2940 2018-07-12 18:02:20 have you tried neem oil?
2941 2018-07-12 18:01:58 They predicted the same for NATO and that fizzled. They got exposed like the RATS they are. 

If I said that Germany buys Russian oil, while expecting the American tax payer to foot the bill to protect them from Russia, its conspiracy. Trump says it and hes hating our allies.

2944 2018-07-12 18:01:02 Pacific salmon will soon be fish farmed, oil will flow. Regardless of what rights are being stomped on. Why? Because of money. The provincial & federal Gov’ts are bought & paid for. We elect puppets for the corporations. They tried to kill off NdNs, what’s whales to them?
2945 2018-07-12 18:00:56 @RepErikPaulsen - He has voted for Donald Trump's agenda 98% of the time, taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from the oil and gas industry. We say no more!  #DeanTeam #Phillips4Congress #PhillipsForCongress Vote for @deanbphillips

2948 2018-07-12 18:00:36 If I were to wager; bet that Merkel was personally enriched for allowing the invasion of Germany and Europe to go on for so long. Anyone w common sense would have said, 'we'll send teams of builders to make a city for "refugees" and pay for it with Libyan oil'...

2950 2018-07-12 18:00:06 So long as it's focused on. Same argument for clean energy. I want coal and oil gone, but we can't just dump all those workers. No one can be left behind as we make progress. 
2951 2018-07-12 17:59:59 This was my thought... any US land is suitable for big oil to take a chunk so I guess these two were ahead of their time??!!?
2952 2018-07-12 17:59:53 Pacific salmon will soon be fish farmed, oil will flow. Regardless of what rights are being stomped on. Why? Because of money. The provincial & federal Gov’ts are bought & paid for. We elect puppets for the corporations. They tried to kill off NdNs, what’s whales to them?
2953 2018-07-12 17:59:49 hmm boundary conditions on 1 ... D5-D6 spread can only get so big this year, theoretically maxing at the relatively low D4 price if D6 were to go to 0 (just sayin'). Currently that is ~$0.45, with cronically low D4 #RINs price because of soy tariffs and high oil.
2954 2018-07-12 17:59:36 Yes, there's still a lot, like toilet paper (need a bidet toilet) that's still in plastic. Have found some chocolate that comes in plant based compostable wraps  I buy a lot of bulk items from soap, olive oil, sugar, spices..etc bring in my own reusable containers & fill.
2955 2018-07-12 17:59:24 itu untuk satu macem oil, tunggu bentaran smpe agak menyerap smbil usap terus. baru pake oil yg satu macem lg dan make sama kyk yg tdi()
2956 2018-07-12 17:59:20 Taxes from 50 permanent employees is a drop in the bucket.  Alberta charges the lowest royalties in the world for its oil.  The 65 year old #pipeline leaks and is already beyond its projected 50-year lifespan.
2957 2018-07-12 17:59:13 Le Vaucluse département le plus pauvre de la région PACA elle même sur le podium des régions.

2959 2018-07-12 17:59:09 The islands belong to the islanders. Not Argentina. I hope you enjoy not getting any of that oil after Kirchner tore up the resources sharing agreement.
2960 2018-07-12 17:59:03 Were you paying attention? Trump was asking Mercel why they are building a pipeline to Russia because of the NATO sanctions against Russia. If Russia sells oil to Germany they make money! Something Trump is against. Do your research and quit following main stream media!
2961 2018-07-12 17:59:01 I need a deep tea tree oil cleansing to the scalp.
2962 2018-07-12 17:58:59 "Fiddling while Rome burns," except misting our aging bodies with plant oil.
2963 2018-07-12 17:58:50 Illegal immigrants are taking our oil?
2964 2018-07-12 17:58:48 Thanks Rick. Because of you, I am now growing and making oil for my own personal use. It still shocks me how uninformed the medical professionals are on the subject, but not surprised, considering the medical education was hijacked decades ago.
2965 2018-07-12 17:58:23 I believe my friend @babyyaliaa is secretly rich and an oil tycoon. Bitch better fly me out to Saint Tropez for brunch.

2968 2018-07-12 17:58:19 40% of US oil is domestic production, 12% from Canada and 6% from Saudi.
2969 2018-07-12 17:58:00 $CEI  maybe that oil price get up a little more to CLEAR that $ 70 mark and MR.  SHORTY can get his panties in a wad ( are u ready smart kids ? )
2970 2018-07-12 17:57:54 maybe if Canada boosted up our nuclear weapons then maybe Trump would give us a bit more respect like with North Korea.
More effective than an oil pipeline that bails out a Texas company.
2971 2018-07-12 17:57:54 I think Exxon is the only one who has equipment to drill where the oil is located.

What do you think Mr.Trump?
2980 2018-07-12 17:57:22 Its not a loan,its investment... South Africa buys 47% of our oil from Saudi Arabia... They are returning the favour

2985 2018-07-12 17:56:13 I've met some who loved the Christian life at one time, were convinced they were born again, yet depart from the faith.  I recall the 10 virgins, 5 foolish, no oil, all nicely dressed with lamps, but it really is an issue of ones heart's, love for Jesus Christ, by the Holy Spirit
2986 2018-07-12 17:56:13 Oil changed now a car wash 
2987 2018-07-12 17:56:01 update: apparently I have to come back after 500 miles to get an oil change bc they can't do one today since I had no oil in my thing

Elan this world needs you , 
3000 2018-07-12 17:54:37 You're not. Coconut oil is the way, the truth, and the light.
3001 2018-07-12 17:54:37 Thx Paul! Im just trying to learn. What are your fav sources for oil/commodity data? I’ll start there and build my knowledge base further over time. I appreciate your response
3002 2018-07-12 17:54:36 Baby oil does not even taste like babies.
3003 2018-07-12 17:54:21 That freshly washed hair, full body shave, sugar scrub, coconut oil down  Nothing like it. Send him to VM, he’s doesn’t deserve u today. Today you’re a goddess!
3004 2018-07-12 17:54:03 Most successful economic governor in US History.... an Air Force veteran flying the C130 and a family history working in the energy and oil businesses.. he's more qualified than anyone in the Sec Of Energy office since it's creation, bubba.
3005 2018-07-12 17:53:53 You ever go to get an oil change and buy a new truck? No? I guess that’s what makes me, me.
3006 2018-07-12 17:53:46 I did everything I was suppose to but get my oil changed & that will be done tomorrow morning 
3007 2018-07-12 17:53:45 I actually just started taking tumeric in honey alternating with ginger, it's supposed to have many benefits.  I haven't tried black seed oil but I think I'll look into it.  I always try a holistic approach first, I have a sensitive system to meds.

3011 2018-07-12 17:53:33 One last comment cause I can’t resist. You are aware that Carbon is the building block of life on this planet right? Who proves it’s bad & will cause our demise.  Don’t get me wrong, there is a hell of a lot that polluters of this earth must chg. I don’t think oil/gas is one.
3012 2018-07-12 17:53:27 Sell your snake oil somewhere else.
3013 2018-07-12 17:53:20 At a jiffy lube rn to get an oil change and a mid 60s white woman just walked in less then 1 minute ago and immediately ran out into the garage when no one was in the building to help her as soon as she got here. Wut.
3014 2018-07-12 17:53:17 for an oil change ?? 
3015 2018-07-12 17:53:10 And what is tRUmp doing? Increasing dependence on oil and coal (I refuse to call it clean coal. There is no such thing.).
3016 2018-07-12 17:53:08 Love when you get that oil change and they wash your car for you and shine the tires #feelingood
3017 2018-07-12 17:52:45 brown rice pasta, sugar snap peas, some bacon chopped up, a red onion chopped, spiralised courgette all cooked in vegetable oil like a stirfry!! you can add some nuts or extra vegetable oil at the end

3024 2018-07-12 17:52:22 Awhile! You should check your oil tho!
3025 2018-07-12 17:52:15 but what about "0 STARS I'M ALLERGIC TO HYALURONIC ACID/MINERAL OIL/WHATEVER INGREDIENT THIS MADE ME BREAKOUT SO BADLY"

bitch I'm NOT allergic to it this is the opposite of helpful

also special SO to "1/5 the cap was broken when I got it"
3026 2018-07-12 17:52:09 It was the Moroccan oil. We been on.
3027 2018-07-12 17:51:42 For sale. Weird wolf. 50x59cm, oil. Your price.
3028 2018-07-12 17:51:34 Gas prices are higher and lower than they were under Obama.  It's an 8 year span.  Right now they are about halfway between the lowest price and the highest price under Obama.  The price spiked when OPEC reduced production.  The price of oil has almost nothing to do with the US
3029 2018-07-12 17:51:05 @CapitalFirstLtd in lieu of rising dollar, oil spike, worsening macros, monerary tightening, this swap deal with IDFC definitely needs a relook. Needs to be Sweetened a bit  for CFL shareholders.
3030 2018-07-12 17:50:52 ...didn't the U.S just ask the UN to cut off oil to them?,,,is that great progress?...could your clarify "great progress"?....

3033 2018-07-12 17:50:46 Also try applying oil on the eyelids.. works on the same weighing down principle.. my paati’s advice when I was fighting insomnia.. worked like a charm :)

3038 2018-07-12 17:50:01 Will someone come with me to get my oil changed? Those men make me nervous
3039 2018-07-12 17:49:53 For oil refineries!
3040 2018-07-12 17:49:46 Please stop attacking Trump from the right. His policies towards Russia so far: 

-killed Exxon-Ru oil deal
-bombed top Ru ally
-expelled Ru diplomats
-forced RT to register as a foreign agent
-kept troops on RU border
-sold weapons to anti-Ru Ukraine
3041 2018-07-12 17:49:44 My favorite go to when I want something resembling the kinds of desserts I used to eat is all natural peanut butter mixed with coconut oil and just a little raw honey. I suppose stevia is an option also, but I eat mine on my 100 grams of carbs days. #keto #paleo #carbcycling
3042 2018-07-12 17:49:40 Iran has taken a sharp U turn from it's earlier statement of chopping all ties with India...in case there will be any ties with Arab world....Iran says it will do its best to ensure security of oil supply to #India as it has been a reliable energy partner for #NewDelhi.
3043 2018-07-12 17:49:37 Overwashing your hair strips it of it’s natural oils, so your head starts to OVER produce oil, causing greasy hair.

3051 2018-07-12 17:48:42 (1/2) Pretty sure it's the same people who think mass media is gospel are now hating Musk based on the slanderous coverage he gets. They don't understand that mass media has been used as a blow horn for the entrenched oil / auto interests that see him as a threat.
3052 2018-07-12 17:48:39 these mechanics just came in to tell me that I had absolutely no oil on my stick and I said "is that bad" and this is why I hate doing car stuff
3053 2018-07-12 17:48:38 I really love that oil it’s working wonders for my skin!

3056 2018-07-12 17:48:14 I have been on the fence about this sunflower oil for a long time. IDK if my skin needs it that bad but I see it on here often.
3057 2018-07-12 17:48:03 You were convinced that you were born again, yet you departed. I've met others who loved the Christian life at one time, similar to you but departed from the faith. I recall the 10 virgins, 5 foolish, no oil, nicely dressed, but it really is an issue ones heart's, love for God.
3058 2018-07-12 17:47:35 We buy millions of barrels of oil from Russia. Mmmmmm
3059 2018-07-12 17:47:35 Why did I choose today for Chevy to change my car’s oil.. they take foreverrrrr!
3060 2018-07-12 17:47:25 nope that was some essential oil
3061 2018-07-12 17:47:12 Remember Pearl Harbor. After that, there was no option for peace since peace had cease with the surprise attack. To this day, the U.S.S. Arizona stills bleeds oil- symbolic blood- to remind us to always be viligant against aggression in today's hostile world.
3062 2018-07-12 17:47:09 They were mowing on the midcape at exit 4 and the backup started right after the bridge. So I was 45 mins late to my 1pm oil change. Left at 12:15 which would have been PLENTY of time 
3063 2018-07-12 17:47:08 Oil washing?
3064 2018-07-12 17:47:05 how long can one drive their car with their change oil light on ?? asking for a friend
3065 2018-07-12 17:47:01 The Greeks, Cypriotis, Spanish
& Coastal/Island Italians among others have known for years, that adding the darkest green olive oil to their skin would protect them from the harshness of the sun

Yet, again, they developed the mid day lunch & nap to stay OUT of the worst of it!
3066 2018-07-12 17:47:01 Asked can you cook but asking about cutting grass. You live in apartment or your grass don’t have grass. 
Can you change the oil but your Check Engine light been on for a while. 
Can you build a house at the same time you on section 8.
3067 2018-07-12 17:46:52 Love him or hate him, Trump is getting the increased oil production from OPEC that he demanded, bringing the price of oil under $70.

3076 2018-07-12 17:46:14 In fact, every Norwegian is in theory a millionaire, you know....oil and all of that, no foreign debt and we are not going to have that do to investments.
What Trump is using is tariffs, that happening once before and it was a stupid move from the president in question.
3077 2018-07-12 17:46:08 I’m trying teatree oil for the first time on my face. I diluted it with water but I should get another oil that benefits oily skin. Because, if I’m gonna do $9 on a small bottle, I might as well get something else.
3078 2018-07-12 17:46:05 Tried to make some dinner in an uncoated pan, but had no salt, pepper, nor any oil. At least the gas stove was working somewhat...

3084 2018-07-12 17:45:26 SUPER FAKE NEWS!!! To set the numbers straight: In 2017 only 24% of Germanys energy consumption was gas, 40% came from Russia. That means 9,6% of Russian gas in the overall consumption. If we add oil from Russia the total share is 23%, still far from 70%

3089 2018-07-12 17:44:48 Trump strong arming folks into PAYING MORE for NATO does not seem to be the actions of a man looking to end it. Calling out Merkel for begging Putin for oil is not ending the alliance. It's a chance to strengthen it. #CNN
3090 2018-07-12 17:44:30 Tweet by Ana Navarro, Republican:
Trump tells NATO, Germany is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Germany gets its oil.
Ok, well, by that logic....
Trump is controlled by Russia because that’s from where Trump got his presidency.

3094 2018-07-12 17:43:42 That 3.2 billion goes to all oil and gas. You’d have to also include taxes from those operations and their employees as a revenue stream, as well as the revenue from the pipeline itself now that all profits are going to the owner (govt).
3095 2018-07-12 17:43:33 Plus ICE only works because oil is subsidized worldwide.

3119 2018-07-12 17:41:30 I don't recall Trump ever saying that he wanted to overturn prior sanctions, though he didn't want to add more last year. The congress had to make him, but this year he added more on his own.

Another company will drill that oil just the same, might as well been a US company.

3126 2018-07-12 17:41:16 America really is just starting to export LNG. Laws were in place prohibiting export of unprocessed petroleum products for decades.
Oil had to be refined before export. Nat gas had to be polymerized into plastic before export. That changed about 10 yrs ago, iirc. @rushlimbaugh

3141 2018-07-12 17:40:09 They're also assisted heavily by the US in one way or another. Usually by defense funding, or lack of need of it because of alliance. Norway, the biggest success, is only that way because of their oil sector. These socialist economies are unsustainable.

3147 2018-07-12 17:39:40 Yes the Russian oil check that Rex handed out
3148 2018-07-12 17:39:39 Not only is Germany NOT fulfilling it's 2% of GDP promise to help fund NATO, but it is buying 40% of its oil from  - wait for it - Russia - the raison d'être for NATO and NOT from its friend and partner the US
3149 2018-07-12 17:39:36 Lets hope he comes back with cheaper oil that could help us buy a litre of petrol with R2

3154 2018-07-12 17:39:17 You’re correct

But oil < 70
3155 2018-07-12 17:39:17 And you failed to explain why? Oil and gas prices have gone up. Electricity prices along with them. Virtually everything costs more 4 consumers. Importing oil while exporting. No price breaks 4 US consumers. World market philosophy. India has no oil/gas yet we pay what they do.
3156 2018-07-12 17:39:14 Hi James. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.
3157 2018-07-12 17:39:10 Old oil prices, Oil price forecasts 2025 to 2050

3158 2018-07-12 17:38:55 By your same logic... If Saudi Arabia decide to stop selling us oil... then the saudis will have us by the nuts... is that what you are saying?
3159 2018-07-12 17:38:54  you not girl I’d do the same thing . But no I make my own toner with tea tree , lemon oil and water . The other stuff breaks me out .

3169 2018-07-12 17:37:42 It’s people that are alive that ride on trains. It’s security that attracts investments. Warri is a typical case, from oil rich town to dead town. Nowadays when we talk to foreign investors they ask how can we justify investing in Agro processing when the farmers are in IDP Camp

3173 2018-07-12 17:36:47 Believe it or not, Olive Oil is not great for moisturizing your beard or hair. You're not cooking food, so don't cover your face with it. #beardfacts #oliveoil
3174 2018-07-12 17:36:41 doesnt Quebec block them from selling electricity? 

Quebec does what ever it can to hurt oil businesses in NFld and AB and SK.

not nice
3175 2018-07-12 17:36:41 @thechew Love your show. Here's the thing. Chicken carries Salmonella and unless you wash your hands every single time you touch the chicken, you are contaminating everything e.g. the bottle of olive oil  he just touched, the counter etc.
3176 2018-07-12 17:36:37 Where getting back to that here in Ohio&WV especially Oil alot of People have become wealthy with Oil Deals&there's been a TON of work. It's why I love Trump getting on Germany about buying gas from Russia-if he can bring that business here the U.S. will explode job/money wise.

3192 2018-07-12 17:34:32 @JohnWHuber - you pointed out BBC is trying to play down Germany's import level of Russian Gas. first at one point President Trump referred to energy, not just gas. second if one considers the oil (40%) and coal (30%) imports from Russia reality is likely higher than reported
3193 2018-07-12 17:34:31 So the one person creating an economically significant push away from fossil fuel is your enemy? Seems like a lot of anger that could be directed at, I dunno, oil companies.

3196 2018-07-12 17:34:27 So if standing up to Germany for Russian oil purchases and admission by Ursla in Feb 18 puts him in Russia back pocket, must be an act? He's gotta b a puppet. Makes complete sense.
3197 2018-07-12 17:34:25 Poland refuses oil and gas from Russia. I would have to look at the map of the pipeline but I doubt it runs through there. But if it does, Poland could cut them off at anytime too. So even more vulnerable.
3198 2018-07-12 17:34:18 thank you  not really tbh they are naturally super straight like they dont ever curl even with heat and accessories slide off its kinda annoying.. but i use linseed oil sometimes n it makes them super soft and smooth

3201 2018-07-12 17:33:52 Wouldn’t that be good for the environment then? No wasted plastic, no Diesel engines mining for metals. No Transatlantic supply ships burning heavy oil (16 of the worlds largest ships produce more sulfur pollution then every car in the world combined)

3227 2018-07-12 17:31:08 3) No peace treaty of any kind with North Korea. Trump gave Kim a treat and got ZIP in return. NK delegates didn't even show up at planned meeting this morning.
4) Killing the Paris Accord, destroying the EPA defunding renewable energy projects. Big oil says muchas gracias

3234 2018-07-12 17:30:00 I miss the smell of linseed oil and damar varnish in the morning. I paint in acrylics.

3240 2018-07-12 17:28:43 2/. What do you think would happen to any country that relies primarily on oil exports, owes debts in a foreign currency, and sees an oil price collapse?  Not saying Maduro has done a good job - just asking what you think would happen that any gov would have to deal with.
3241 2018-07-12 17:28:42 LMAO. Folks really thought they were just gonna get away all the atrocities they have done by disabling their nuclear program? Good luck starting it back up without oil. The long game wins again.

3243 2018-07-12 17:28:33 I've heard that they've done worse than that too. Is it big oil that makes them escape justice? @nikkihaley is working on that (I hope).
3244 2018-07-12 17:28:31 Eeuu subsidia a los farmers que tienen un gas oil de 0,50 y vos propones más impuestos, un gas oil de 1,33 y apertura de mercado? En qué facultad estudiaste ?
3245 2018-07-12 17:28:30 Oil down 7%. American airlines down 8%. This CEO of AAL need to step down.

3247 2018-07-12 17:28:18 Um, what are we raising money for?
3248 2018-07-12 17:28:12 Nobody would throw fire on others if they themselves own a oil company.

3250 2018-07-12 17:27:58 OIL platforms needed sub type drones&the BASKET DRONES/flight drones were from platform to supply ships? I am real. I just did not go to school.

3266 2018-07-12 17:25:48 Yes, she is "immensely qualified" is you believe in destroying the Endangered Species Act. Zinke loves hiring ranchers, oil, gas, coal, and trophy hunters to get rid of those "pesky" species that interfere with them.
3267 2018-07-12 17:25:47 We don't have term limits at all, except for the Office of the President. Thank God for that...America couldn't take another 8 years of Obuma.

#FactCheck: It’s sadder U.S. debt to China is $1.19 trillion. That’s 19% of the $6.29 trillion in Treasury bills, notes, and bonds held by foreign countries. USA is totally “captive” to China.

3280 2018-07-12 17:23:59 I'll always remember 2008. I was on one of the market tv shows with a floor trader who was full Tom Cruise on the couch as he discussed "$150 to $200" crude oil. 
I pointed out that given the spot spread $2-plus carry, the market was going down. 
Hit $30 in December if I recall.

3293 2018-07-12 17:22:46 The ad is pretty clear in its message. @FLGovScott has repeatedly denied that climate change is real. His environmental policies and his love for big oil endanger EVERYONE living in FL. We think it’s time people learn the truth about Scott.

3296 2018-07-12 17:22:40 @realDonaldTrump I remember a comic book dr. jekyl and mr. hyde u epitomize the foolishness of both characters . 20% of German energy comes from ur buddy vald . u have done nothing to ween My Country from 3rd world oil producers . Smoke is Thicker !!!!

3313 2018-07-12 17:20:02 If renewable energy is a myth, Jeff "Gasbag" Lord, why do the oil, gas and coal industries require lavish subsidies paid by American taxpayers?
3314 2018-07-12 17:20:00 Why don't the USA leave Europe and the Middle East and let oil producer countries price oil in whatever currency they wish, ending the petrodollar era?
3315 2018-07-12 17:19:56 Trump does not like Europe to buy gas from Russia. But the US are happy to buy oil from Saudi, a country without freedom of speech, where women have no rights and that exports a conservative version of islam to the rest of the world, encouraging religious extremists.

3319 2018-07-12 17:19:45 Rosemary, and thyme are my two favorite to make a wet rub out of. Olive oil, little butter, sea salt, pepper, fresh crushed garlic, ground rosemary, and thyme. Super awesome flavors!
3320 2018-07-12 17:19:38 no,it makes alot of sense,Assad was the one buying the oil from ISIS
3321 2018-07-12 17:19:23 Great, risk to reward ratio. I'll be stalking the oil sector for more potential weakness.

3327 2018-07-12 17:18:37 NATO wants us to fight for them while they enjoy buying oil and gas from 
RUSSIA ( it's the only export the reds have )
They've been told to pay up!!!

They are all over the place.

3333 2018-07-12 17:18:02 first he start the month with the tariff war, then he tells germany grow some balls and stop being dependent on russia for oil, he tells nato get ya money up or we backing out. this is just july.
3334 2018-07-12 17:17:58 Riyadh is bribing SA, for when UN Security Council votes on Yemen are held. Riyadh is facing a credit crunch from low oil revenues & resorted to introducing income taxes & borrowing in the bond markets. So, where does it suddenly get $10bn from to "invest" in South Africa?!

3337 2018-07-12 17:17:24 So why did you ask the UN to cut off oil to North Korea?  You're a blatant liar.

3344 2018-07-12 17:16:39 Germany buys its oil from Russia. Makes a whole lot of scense. I bet Russia kills the line when they decide to invade weak ass Germany.

3357 2018-07-12 17:14:44 OK, so now you acknowledge that oil is much bigger and consequently more powerful than green energy. Progress, then. Excellent.
3358 2018-07-12 17:14:39 I fail to see the expected oil/gasoline/fluid slick....must be under where it is now.

3367 2018-07-12 17:13:33 Distraction. I mean its not even what this thread was discussing. She knows i had a point so now she's on about oil and using wrong numbers in the process.
Germany gets approx 4% of its energy from Russia not 70%. That is directly from the German ambassador.
3368 2018-07-12 17:13:33 Mau share aja step by step my skin care routine yag cukup memakan waktu:
1. bersihin muka pake baby oil buat ngangkat makeup yg waterproof
2. stlh dibersihin pake baby oil terus dibersihin lagi pake micellar water
3. muka udh lumayann enteng lalu lanjut cuci muka pake facial foam
3369 2018-07-12 17:13:19 To set the numbers straight: In 2017 only 24% of Germanys energy  consumption was gas, 40% came from Russia. That means 9,6% of Russian  gas in the overall consumption. If we add oil from Russia the total  share is 23%, still far from 70% @GERonEconomy @GermanyDiplo

3382 2018-07-12 17:12:28 I said to myself I was gonna stop playing Anno 2205 as I've essentially done what I could aside from the final mission which would take forever....but then I completed mining asteroids on the moon...then the oil rigs up north...drained the swamps in tundra...
3383 2018-07-12 17:12:28 SA have enough oil refineries? With the price of fuel demand will be even less!
3384 2018-07-12 17:12:10 You’re correct, we did cut off oil to Japan but correct me if I’m wrong I believe it was before 1941. We also stopped selling them scrap iron, steel, and other industrial products because of their expansion and their attack on China.

3390 2018-07-12 17:11:10 I got mine off amazon.. they are small bottles and a little on the pricey side but since it’s oil it spreads really well so you don’t have to use a lot of it

3396 2018-07-12 17:10:29 @jimcramer Your idea about Germany buying US gas is great (for Germany) until war breaks out.  At that point, a couple of KILO class subs could put Germany out of the gas business. You might mention this on your show, TIME WE CONSERVE OUR OIL & GAS, LIKE REAGAN AND OTHERS THOUGHT

3413 2018-07-12 17:09:13 Common sense mate, you want protection from Russia for free on American taxpayers backs,  Germany  also giving millions to Russia for oil/ gas..Russia builds up aggression, EU says dont, Russia closes pipeline, who's in control of Germany? How did Germany deal outside EU states?
3414 2018-07-12 17:09:11 Driving to your summer vacation? Make sure your vehicle is in

3416 2018-07-12 17:08:57 Living in Texas and working at UT, I got to know some people in the oil business. On the whole they have bigger ranches than the climate people do.
3417 2018-07-12 17:08:55 The U. S. is on pace to leap-frog Saudi Arabia and Russia and reclaim the title of the world's biggest oil producer for the first time since the 1970s.

3419 2018-07-12 17:08:45 If several cars derail then you have several car's worth of oil spilled. If a pipeline leaks, far more than several car's worth of oil could spill. Embridge's Kalamazoo pipeline leak spilled over One Million US gallons of diluted bitumen. The possible destruction is much higher

3429 2018-07-12 17:07:13 65 crude is level where oil companies do very well. So still bullish energy equity names with crude at 70.
3430 2018-07-12 17:07:10 Thc rso. It’s a thick concentrated oil you get after going through an extraction process with the plant
3431 2018-07-12 17:07:08 What happens when we run out of oil and the soil goes dry and we can’t turn the lights on .. @officialjaden
3432 2018-07-12 17:07:06 My disagreement with you is that you're a flim-flam artist, trying to sell snake oil. The con man always uses victimhood as a tool.

3436 2018-07-12 17:06:48 Is that sun dried? I mean we have no shortage of sun   , better than deep frying it with oil. American junk food hasn’t done any good for Americans. We don’t have to follow their footsteps. We can be better and I wish you best of luck.

3440 2018-07-12 17:06:21 Wrong. UK out of resources. If US didn’t lend $ and supplies UK would be lost. UK borrowed so much didn’t finish paying loans til 2006. lend lease. US loaned oil weapons food. To soviets too who had nothing but expendable citizens to offer. how they held out. Learn some history.
3441 2018-07-12 17:06:19 Where do environmentalists get this crazy notion that the world market for dirty oil is evaporating, and investing $5-10 billion in a leaky pipeline is a bad idea?

3444 2018-07-12 17:05:56 South Africa is one of Iran’s largest foreign trade partners.

$10B is nothing to Saudi Arabia in exchange to South Africa limiting trade, I.E oil, to allow Saudi Arabian companies access to our markets.

But then again Politics-Economics never makes sense.
3445 2018-07-12 17:05:49 Trump #NATO Germany is a Russian puppet? Just because they buy energy from Putin ?Who liberated Germany from Hitler? USA is buying oil from Saudi Arabia, their pilots killed 3,000 Americans?? On 911 attack  what a hypocrite

3) Crippling Tariffs and Immigration policies that are killing industries, most notably Agriculture. 
4) A terrible environmental policy that will make us MORE dependent on foreign oil, not less.

3536 2018-07-12 16:57:02 is it the new coconut oil??
3537 2018-07-12 16:56:54 Exactly. That mentality has hurt this country so much. Also, 'the oil producing nation' thingy has led to so much free money. This has made Nigeria put more value in oil than her most important resource -  people. Hence, a million Nigerian deaths wouldn't bother Buhari.

3551 2018-07-12 16:55:30 And who do we get our oil from? Muslim countries in the mid-east? As in @realDonaldTrump complaining that opec isn't producing enough oil for us and causing our prices to increase? As he levies tariffs on our allies causing their prices to increase. He's a hypocrite.

3567 2018-07-12 16:53:42 cooking soy with soybean oil feels weird
3568 2018-07-12 16:53:36 Because just like he was lying yesterday in Europe about the amount of oil and gas Germany gets from Russia and no one corrected him!! No one gets louder than him, sets him straight and “speak truth to moron”
3569 2018-07-12 16:53:26 The world revolves around the Tree of Life. “In the center of the garden was the tree of life.” -Genesis 2:9. This is where the oil of grace grows!
3570 2018-07-12 16:53:24 konti na lang papasok ko na tong mga oil pastel ko sa ilong nya grrrr
3571 2018-07-12 16:53:23 Wow. There’s no need to be abusive. Even if you did have greater mental capacity than either of us it’s worth remembering you still support a shit team backed by slavery oil money based in a shithole 
3572 2018-07-12 16:53:17 And there's still billions in oil subsidies fighting against clean energy.
3573 2018-07-12 16:53:01 Disagree on fish oil - it’s close to impossible (or at least disgusting) to try getting enough omega fats from diet alone. Nobody is eating sardines at every meal or salmon 3x/day.
3574 2018-07-12 16:52:58 This is awesome that pepper gun was full auto
3575 2018-07-12 16:52:54 So we arent killing bear and wolf cubs and drilling for oil, or is all of that still on?
3576 2018-07-12 16:52:50 MOVIE REVIEW -
Your sister loves RoboCop 
She reenacted the scenes 
described how she'd toss his metal salad 
and perform an oil change at the same time 
She even mentioned calling her vibrator 'RoboCock' 
It was grotesque 
It was awkward 
So I took my fork and dug her eyes out
3577 2018-07-12 16:52:46 Oil market food for thought: flat Permian production from Q318-Q319 likely means 2019 avg US prod grows by 500-600k not 1.0mmb/d+ (with GofMex growth of 100-200). VZ on track to lose another 500kb/d+ and Iran will be down 500-1.5mmb/d. Not yet in EIA/IEA/OPEC forecasts #OOTT
3578 2018-07-12 16:52:32 จริงเหรอคะเนี่ย นึกว่าจะมีปัญหาแต่กับหมาขนยาวๆซะอีกเพราะเห็นหมาขนสั้นขนร่วงน้อย หรือร่วงก็ไม่เห็นนะคะ 55555555/กินปลาทูเสี่ยงเป็นไตจริงเหรออคะ นี่แอบเอาให้แมวจรจัดแถวมอกินบ่อยมากเลยค่ะ ตายแล้ว นึกว่าเป็นปลาจะไม่เป็นไรซะอีกนะคะ
3579 2018-07-12 16:52:10 Oh, so you think the guy that changes the oil at Walmart should make more than the guy that designed the car? Of course not. Quit being an imbecile.
3580 2018-07-12 16:52:09 You do know they buy oil and gas from Russia right? Yet NATO takes money for defence from countries like Russia.
3581 2018-07-12 16:52:03 I thought that was the middle east. We don't have any forces in venezuela, to my knowledge. It's far easier to conquer a land for its resources than it is to "smuggle oil, currency, and food" out of said country.
3582 2018-07-12 16:52:01 vitamin e and apple cider vinegar, acv at night, vitamin e in the am. & tea tree oil in my regular skin care routine
3583 2018-07-12 16:51:52 Big club? Hahahaha funded by oil money
3584 2018-07-12 16:51:47 Putin is a dictator in a poor country. GDP is tiny compared to those in the liberal democracies. The only thing he has to sell is gas and oil. America now exports gas. Until Crimea, no nation took them seriously. I have to hand it to him. He has done alot with such few resources.
3585 2018-07-12 16:51:24 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
3586 2018-07-12 16:51:15 She hugged him back. 

"Thank you Souda."
3587 2018-07-12 16:51:05 R U really this dumb Skippy?
YOUR #CPC Govt added $160B to our National Debt, after inheriting a large Liberal surplus! & U left a crumbling infrastructure & economy reliant on Oil, w world Oil prices plunging.
74% os ALL Cdn debt is due to Harper + Mulroney.
Smarten up eh?
3588 2018-07-12 16:51:02 Trump has committed crimes. His Presidency could end after Mueller's investigative report is released. His top priority is removing Russian sanctions so the Exxonmoble/ Roseneft Oil merger occurs. His cut is 25 Billion. He wants to get paid before he is forced from office.
3589 2018-07-12 16:50:56 Alcohol, B.O. unsuccessfully covered by either Axe cologne or more expensive stuff, Tiki torch oil, and old money, (in some cases) Most of all, there is an underlying rotten smell. I'm not sure whether it's their brains or hearts. They have no souls, so not that.
3590 2018-07-12 16:50:50 Real shit tho don’t speak on murder that’s debatable while paying taxes for real murder over things like oil and ancient beef and act like an activist for unborn children. Better see that energy at a protest against defunding planned parenthood.
3591 2018-07-12 16:50:40 Something just came to mind, Mr. POTUS. How about that
PIPELINE up north that was to bring more OIL to America?
That meathead Obama kept putting it off.
3592 2018-07-12 16:50:22 Hmmm, mom's friend has a pet wellness store & she recommended Grizzly Pollock Oil for joints & coat cuz my big brofur has allergies & a birth defect in his front paw tendons. We all take it & he barely shed at all this year & he sheds a lot, it was great! Very good 4 joints 2!
3593 2018-07-12 16:50:09 I rise to oppose Bernie.
Free college, health care, eliminate poverty?
Good ideas I support...but quick question?
These are not free? Who pays for all of this free stuff?
Venezuela tried and had huge oil revenues...look what happened?
Take a clue and learn.
3594 2018-07-12 16:50:01 Serious question, you go on Twitter to bash a dealership for attempting to up sell you something and attempting to explain in simple terms but you didn’t bash the quick lube place on Twitter for causing an oil leak? Why only attack the dealerships?
3595 2018-07-12 16:49:56 Yazi sindindwa ngamathe. Sigcotshiswe ngama-baby oil just for it to be wet. Even buy lube 

Kanti there's myths like these ones? 
This sounds painful to say the least
3596 2018-07-12 16:49:56 Italians vape olive oil
3597 2018-07-12 16:49:52 Super interesting and thanks for the insight! TBH I’m not too familiar with the Russian oil sector so this gives me a little more info to research. Any advice on books/blogs/articles to learn more about it?
3598 2018-07-12 16:49:51 I'm all for saving the planet, great. Just want to put things in perspective though. Dairy-free "healthful" plant-based creamer ingredients: soy, sugar, palm oil, maltodextrin . . . Apparently dairy consumption is down by 40% in US and obesity well . . . Speaks for itself.
3599 2018-07-12 16:49:50 I hate coming to get my oil changed  somehow I always end up waiting 2 hours +
3600 2018-07-12 16:49:45 You think his loyalty is with Putin? He literally called Germany out for their dependence on Russian oil. Directly against Putin’s interests
3601 2018-07-12 16:49:45 African(or west African) natural hair, in its natural state, without extensive moisturizing, deep conditioning, globs of Shea butter, oil, etc etc, is a pain to maintain. Stress pain and real physical pain.
3602 2018-07-12 16:49:44 Not when there are lobbyists fighting for oil to stay on top. What excuse is there to make bad decisions? I said it was harder not impossible. And it is harder.

3604 2018-07-12 16:49:34 Sentiment has been massively bullish on Oil and are traders have been positions as such based on COT data. The juice has been squeezed already. Iran isn't the catalyst oil bulls hoped for.

3608 2018-07-12 16:49:03 The private Indian oil companies which import Iranian oil are threatened and they will do what other private companies do, they will cut oil imports. However the government companies can carry on the import.
3609 2018-07-12 16:48:52 My point exactly, they can slow production, which in turn creates more demand......which then drives the price up......it’s a joke....., there is not shortage of crude oil, in fact the latest Scientific evidence shows there is enough oil still under ground for the next 300 years
3610 2018-07-12 16:48:48 lmaooo i really need my oil changed
3611 2018-07-12 16:48:42 for sure!!! yoongs knows which coconut oil to buy you. he buys you anti-frizz serum when he sees you’re close to being out. you say you’re about to have wash day and he’s like “okay bae, do you want me to help you section your hair?” 
3612 2018-07-12 16:48:40 I knew it was going be a bad day when I leave the house without curling my lashes and grabbing my oil pen 
3613 2018-07-12 16:48:40 Vince Cabel is absolutely right,  Trump is in favor of a Putin state. Peddling his sake oil to ruin our democracy and freedom.A modern day charlatan. If people can't see through him,all I can say is they will be taken in by anything.
3614 2018-07-12 16:48:38 It's 100 percent true that it's the MAIN factor, which is why I included that word specifically. The next factor is the combination of technology/cost of drilling/price of oil, and tax is just one factor in that middle part of the equation.
3615 2018-07-12 16:48:29 Great point...like I said...they've now lost all control of the situation and they can't stop the flow of oil and coal into the North from Russia and China...gonna get a lot worse
3616 2018-07-12 16:48:28 So we’re at the Calgary stampede and all of us just lathered on sunscreen and all the Irish cousins just lathered on suntan oil they’re really serious about this tanning thing

3619 2018-07-12 16:48:19 Oil down another 1% today. As I said last week, oil wasn't going much higher. So much for those calling for $100+/barrel because of Iran.

3626 2018-07-12 16:47:00 Many have done that a long time, but probably more of them are learning it. I think it spreads like an oil slick.
3627 2018-07-12 16:46:58 Palm oil or crude oil? 
Govt should do something abeg
3628 2018-07-12 16:46:53 Again, you want to allow oil drilling in parks. Very anti-environmental. #lyingrob #VoteRepublicansOut
3629 2018-07-12 16:46:50 Oil Prices steadied after sharp losses the previous session as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said the world’s oil supply cushion “might be stretched to the limit” due to production losses.
3630 2018-07-12 16:46:49 Horseshit pal. PET also had to pay for baby boom build infratructure, roads, hospitals, schools .. as an oil embargo quadrupled the price of of oil. Any idea what that did to world economies, numbers and budgets?

3635 2018-07-12 16:46:36 I don't think it's any secret that petroleum engineers have long recognized Trey Gowdy's hair as a vast and untapped source of fuel oil.
3636 2018-07-12 16:46:33 There was one time when I bought tea tree oil for my GF on the way to the airport. The bottle broke and the oil stained my whole bag just before the flight. 

It was a full flight and everyone around  me was talking about the 'smell'.

 It was a tough day.
3637 2018-07-12 16:46:30 #Ali_Alnaimi was an incredibly intelligent oil minister. The oil strategy he put forth is the strategy that all succeeding ministers should adopt. When #oil_prices become too high, defer investment by producers in alternatives by increasing oil production. As world demand...

3640 2018-07-12 16:46:22 Iran should look at oil prices today. As usual Trump is right

3643 2018-07-12 16:46:08 Yup and the wont buy oil from Russia with the money saved because the U.S. is subsidizing there defense spending.
3644 2018-07-12 16:46:02 @UBS 1/3: while escalating trade tensions could weigh on #oil demand, the global  oil market will remain in deficit this year, in our view. #Brent prices  recovered part of their losses on Thursday and we maintain our Brent  forecast for USD 85/bbl over three, six, and 12 months.
3645 2018-07-12 16:45:56 Isn't this just fondue, but the oil kind, not the cheese or chocolate kind?
3646 2018-07-12 16:45:53 Ever heard of turmeric for inflammation? I take 2 forms of "optimized" turmeric which are helpful, and also black seed oil. I am almost 65, and still do a ton of physical labor. (Like pulling knapweed for hours) I think they both help me a lot. Also with a lot of other things too

3659 2018-07-12 16:44:43 No Canadian refineries. Previous tory governments sold our oil to foreign countries now we pay with our soles to buy back refined products. Largely from USA!

3661 2018-07-12 16:44:31 That is so dumb.  Why? You are wanting that oil? You can’t get rich from it? We are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and taking their oil. You are going after Iran’s oil!!!
3662 2018-07-12 16:44:14 but that didn’t matter now. 

“Alright, I’m going to shut off most of my systems to make it look real. I’ll keep my auditory sensors on however. You should probably put some oil on and in me as well, but it is up to you.” He got to work, shutting off his lights and eyes.

3688 2018-07-12 16:41:30 @cvpayne Why we do import oil if we have enough to export it?  How us thst energy independence?
3689 2018-07-12 16:41:26 I have been investing in the Stock Market for the last twenty years. Doing pretty well. It moves because of the cost of money, the price of oil, and stability.  What happens in America does not move the market. Based on results, I think I have it pretty right.
3690 2018-07-12 16:41:25 how do you think the dinosaurs would feel if they knew we were using oil as energy????
3691 2018-07-12 16:41:24 IT WASNT JUST TIRES i needed brake pads and oil changes as well i just had it all done at once

3695 2018-07-12 16:40:55 The Clinton Foundation has far more ties to Russia than Trump ever has. Why was Trump chastising NATO leaders over buying Russian oil and gas? You think Russia is happy about this?

3698 2018-07-12 16:40:46 Plz come back after your first semester of college take a history class where a professor teaches the whole truth without propaganda and come back defending that argument. We also bomb other countries to declare war for damn oil.
3699 2018-07-12 16:40:45 far from it. i’ve only talked to one guy who knew how to change oil, many guys lack the basic skills needed to work on cars, or do house work.. i thought girls knowing how to cook was common too 
3700 2018-07-12 16:40:42 if we use up all of the oil really quickly, then there will be no more to pollute later.
3701 2018-07-12 16:40:38 Give us stats and quantify that growth in terms of numbers that have been achieved visa vie direct relation to the past presidents trips, (we are still waiting on the Saudi Arabia oil deal)
3702 2018-07-12 16:40:35 In a totally free market electricity would have won. But the government in the past subsidized oil and gas. Now we're paying for those choices. So the government is subsidizing clean energy to accelerate the push for lower emissions
3703 2018-07-12 16:40:34 Oils, flours & sugars aren’t on the triangle. we don’t do pyramids; it’s a 3D thing:) Nut butters are simply convenient, but prone to be adulterated with sugar, salt & oil. Why not use the whole nut (ground/roasted if necessary) when cooking? Tastes much better & Adulterant-free!
3704 2018-07-12 16:40:29 @Buttersginger ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
 
Or maybe we find tons of oil/gold in Iowa ... that works too.

3706 2018-07-12 16:40:25 It is very sad what happens in the Arab countries, a theories says that it is because of the oil that exists in this region, and some countries want to dominate and have control over the riches of these countries???

3708 2018-07-12 16:40:17 NATO protects not only European Countries it also protects America it is for all nations and all people that is why we began NATO. 
So tell me where is Europe going to get gas and  oil if not from Russia? With Trumps Tariffs the cost would be astronomical
3709 2018-07-12 16:40:15 OPEC and Russia dictate the world price almost exclusively.  The lowest price in the last ten years was March 2016.  Since Trump's inauguration it has been steadily increasing.  Neither Trump nor Obama had anything to with those numbers. Oil is a worldwide commodity, not just US

This gov put my job in jeopardy. No plan to save it. Nuff said.  

3rd generation in the industry. Over 20 years in it myself. Was a Back bone for our nation.  The stress it takes off the cpp alone priceless.

 JT's UN seat plan does not include oil or manufacturing
3717 2018-07-12 16:39:56 Then why did the US ask the UN to cut off oil products to North Korea today? 

Was it because North Korea is still working overtime to build nukes or because they failed to show up at the DMZ this morning to discuss return of our soldiers' remains?
3718 2018-07-12 16:39:52 “doing everything possible to undermine Alberta's oil & gas industry” lol! You’re confused @jkenney or not paying attention. @RachelNotley has done EVERYTHING possible. More than I ever expected from an @NDP government.

3722 2018-07-12 16:39:29 I got the Car Reports for 2 vehicles I'm looking at, and they're good. 

Says "service record" a few times but I'm assuming if there are no accidents that can be oil changes too?

One has 2 accidents but insurance <$2,000 which makes me think they were little scrapes.

3743 2018-07-12 16:37:37 I cried. But the best way I can honor their sacrifice is keep getting up and kicking ass to the big oil monsters. We got more federal court dates coming up, more family still facing charges. Keep standing, we are not done. #resist #NoDAPL #MNIWICONI #NOKXL

3758 2018-07-12 16:35:41 The answer is not to love in huts off the land....why does everyone always go to that?! One answer could be to stop mindlessly consuming and expanding at rates that are unsustainable. Or using resources like oil to further support expansion and production of alternative energy.
3759 2018-07-12 16:35:35 Have you actually looked at the statistics? The largest "oil spill" off the coast of BC was a ferry spilling gasoline. Should we abolish BC ferries because of the risk it poses?

3768 2018-07-12 16:33:49 If dominance was the end goal, why wouldn't the US-Russia align as allies in everything? That would dominate trade (esp. Oil/Gas/Energy), military, land mass, and technology.

The world world would be at the will of these 2 nations.

3780 2018-07-12 16:32:29 I think that is a fair criticism of him and I really wish he would fight big oil more, but I think that there is something to be said in the fact that he shared his patent with other US Automotive companies when he could have very easily owned the local market himself.

3827 2018-07-12 16:27:42 Let me get this straight.. we are protesting against a President who has done absolutely nothing to the UK. Signed a peace treaty with North Korea, and publicly stated he's taking action against oil barons for their unfairness, I know what he stands for, but he gets it done.

This was a big one for me. Shorted before all the bs news & big dump. My unique TA pattern signaled 75 as an apex point for current bull run. 

To hold 75 and continue upwards would've signaled 100 inc. These major points are often rejected esp in BTC

3952 2018-07-12 16:15:41 I'm a Democrat and I don't think that.  When I was growing up we had m-80s, blockbusters, pineapples.  None of got hurt.  But I think there should probably be some rules on firecrackers.  Don't know about right to try. Some rules to broom back snake oil salesmen?
3953 2018-07-12 16:15:39 @sincerelyash Your "Everything You Need to Know About Putting Oil on Your Face" article has me shook. Are you supposed to put Vitamin C oil on after moisturizer as well? I've been living a lie ;(

3956 2018-07-12 16:15:18 The Anglos haver never tired terrorising Iran. In early 1900s, Iranian oil was sold cheaper in Britain than Iran. Then came the coup1953 and return of Shah for more looting of resources. When will the Anglos apologise? Why this unending malevolence?  @guardian @markcurtis30

3974 2018-07-12 16:14:04 Germany is heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas. Russia provided between 50 percent and 75 percent of Germany's gas imports in 2017, according to Eurostat, the European Commission's statistics arm. Germany turned to Russia for roughly half of its oil imports last year.

Thank you very much for your concern.
Please be assured that I do not light oil drums full of coal on fire, I do read books, and periodically bathe.
In that post, I was being intentionally stupid (A Portrait of a Troglodyte as a Young Artist)...
3990 2018-07-12 16:12:43 Lmao if you really believe people should be incarcerated for smoking pot then you are part of the problem with this country. Meanwhile I'm sure you don't pay attention to the thousands of corrupt politicians waging a war for oil on your dollar.

3993 2018-07-12 16:12:32 You are so unbelievably ignorant its is hard to comprehend. NATO is there to protect us not Europe. Buying oil form Russia is a good thing for Germany which is what its leadership has to do for its people. You missed that in President class
3994 2018-07-12 16:12:31 Makes sense. I've done keto and IF in the past. Started doing blood type diet (I'm type 0) a week or so ago, and can already feel the difference. It's close to keto—red meat, no wheat—but some carbs allowed (fruit, berries). And only olive oil + ghee. I like how it feels so far.

4004 2018-07-12 16:12:01 They can use that as an “exist” to increase their indirect market share or as a way to fire Oil prices up.
4005 2018-07-12 16:11:49 This is Baby Boomers (making loads off stock dividends from investments in military oil and pharm) vs. Millennials who share and don’t care what your religion or race may be. Better to live in a basement than to exploit others for ur gain. Time to overthrow the boomers! 
4006 2018-07-12 16:11:46 True. But Bitcoin will prevail because current politics and philosophies around centralization, government, wars, oil, USD, etc won't be sustainable. So how can you be bored about all that?
4007 2018-07-12 16:11:45 What about oil pipelines through our National Parks and waterways? Once destroyed there’s no turning back. That’s a few things that will affect my children and grandchildren.

4015 2018-07-12 16:11:05 For a dressing use a small amount of olive oil (one tablespoon) with balsamic vinegar and herbs.
Tinned sweetcorn and tuna is great, coriander, basil.

4038 2018-07-12 16:08:57 1. It’s not an oil deal, it’s a gas pipeline 2. A military Alliance has nothing to do with Germany getting energy supplies from Russia. Germany has been getting natural gas from Russia since the 70s even during the Cold War when they were “enemies” Do your homework.
4039 2018-07-12 16:08:50 Absolutely!!!

4043 2018-07-12 16:08:41 Gasoline (oil) is a worldwide commodity, the price rises and falls based on supply/demand.  A politician has little to do with the cost of gas.  It's the equivalent of saying the price of gold was lower/higher under a president.    That's just not how it works

4048 2018-07-12 16:08:16 It wasn't Obama's responsibility to replace a dying industry with another. Fuel sources change. We no longer rely on whale oil to light our lamps.

4055 2018-07-12 16:07:30 I'm all for Corker's proposed amendment to 232 & yes congressional Repub leaders are being "less than candid", but as for 1980, Carter had vetoed that bill because he *wanted* the price of oil/gasoline to go up – and so it was pretty much a dropkick for Congress to override.

4057 2018-07-12 16:07:19 Yeah, the US wants a piece of pie in German oil and gas market, but it’s a good idea to diversify the sources for energy safety.

4089 2018-07-12 16:05:01 What I'm loving is that every decent rise in the 1 minute chart is seeing a nice fall some 20 minutes after. This tells me that the wiser MMs are sitting there waiting for the dumb dumbs to "buy the dip" before selling off some more. Glorious.

4100 2018-07-12 16:03:36 His assertion that 60-70% of German gas/oil is Russian is way wide of reality (surprise). Is currently 9%. Yep 9%.
But that wouldn't make a good headline, would it. By the way, the amalgamation of TATA/Krupp steel means that US EU steel tariffs hurt UK.

4109 2018-07-12 16:02:54 Let’s say we actually subsidize food after destroying our farmers and manufacturers. When the music of oil stops how do we even procure all these cheap goods. I guess the precept here is that oil will last forever .

India's oil imports from Iran decline by over 25 % in June as India considers acquiescing to demands of @realDonaldTrump for ending oil imports from Iran by November 4.

4182 2018-07-12 15:55:49 In 2017, Germany’s total energy consumption of around 11.5% of natural gas, 12.8% of crude oil, & 7.2% of coal was bought from Russia. That’s a total of 31.5%. It’s inconceivable after Nord Stream becomes operational Germany will get 60% to 70% of its total energy from Russia.

4185 2018-07-12 15:55:46 Seems to me that Germany is quite involved with Russia. Why are we defending Germany against Russia when they are paying them billions of dollars for all of the gas and oil that Germany uses. Also Germany don’t pay their fair share of NATO funding. Hmmmm makes you think huh?

4189 2018-07-12 15:55:23 Eating torture-farmed meat doesn’t even make sense to most people who do it. If a bird's trapped in an oil spill, most of us want to run down + save it.

4371 2018-07-12 15:38:13 Trump was the kid running for class president whose entire platform consisted of “NO HOMEWORK 4EVER!” and “TEACHERZ STINK!” —his ideas are complete nonsense but sound good as digestible soundbites, and that’s why he was successful. He’s not a leader, he’s a snake oil salesman.

4373 2018-07-12 15:38:02 When those #Tesla numbers start growing - the price of oil will start dropping a lot.

4379 2018-07-12 15:37:03 US oil producers are free to pump however much they want. They do not need government permission. And high crude prices certainly encourage them to do so. But oil is a global market, so to drive down price of crude, it helps if other producers increase production.
4380 2018-07-12 15:36:58 When should I get my oil changed?
You should get your oil changed every 3,000 miles or as recommended in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. If intervals are extended, ensure you use oil that is capable of extended mileage changes. Most importantly change your engine oil often enough
4381 2018-07-12 15:36:53 Mungeri Lal stuff - no shipping liner will carry the oil, no insurance company wud insure the ship, no bank will settle the trade (even in ₹ ).

4386 2018-07-12 15:35:57 Damn this guy trump lies and these damn people believe every single word of it. Talking about Germany when we purchase so much oil from Russia ourselves ...disgusting.

As long as we fulfill your unrealistic agenda right? Hydrocarbons are the key to clean energy, you should read up !
4391 2018-07-12 15:35:20 Like bruh if you don’t just change my oil lol I ain’t ask for all that
4392 2018-07-12 15:35:10 Splash of olive oil and bit of honey to sweeten, but the rest is! If you mean the risotto it’s only 4 syns forthr lit but @piliffe will kick off if you cook it at work.
4393 2018-07-12 15:35:10 Those reccomendations are good but dietary changes and keritan oil helps as well
4394 2018-07-12 15:35:00 I still have a lot to figure out with this stuff, especially consistency, but basically... I soaked cashews overnight, sauteed an onion and garlic in oil, and blended all that with beer, nooch, paprika, salt, black pepper, cumin, msg, and turmeric.
4395 2018-07-12 15:35:00 Nom! British dish.  Ingredients: parmesan cheese, coca-cola, coca-cola, thinly sliced celery, italian seasoning, salt, flour, tomato paste, coca-cola, and oil.

4400 2018-07-12 15:34:38 I wonder if they run on super unleaded, or on bio-diesel made from old cooking oil? 
         
And why has Twitter labelled its little aeroplane picture as "airplane"?
4401 2018-07-12 15:34:26 Why would you drive 2 hours for an oil change

4409 2018-07-12 15:34:09 I'm sure that's is a surprise to many Islanders, who think of oil as the standard heating fuel. That only applies here & in the "Boston States".  Our sedimentary rock would be easy to pipe for nat. gas, but heating oil companies here have worked hard to make gas seem dangerous.

4418 2018-07-12 15:33:37 You know that the money that flows into Russia from Europe for purchases of oil & natural gas is part of how Russia comes up with the money that they send to the NRA and your attorneys to help pay you, right?
4419 2018-07-12 15:33:20 Never go to the dealer for a minor job. An oil change? Really? Your wasted time costs more than it would if you went some place local and spent $70.

2. People think that if you support straw bans that you can’t support other things - like being against oil pipelines.
3. People think banning straws means that there can’t be alternatives or allowances for those who need straws.

4443 2018-07-12 15:31:09 IMPORTANT: There is so much interesting data in today's #CPI print that I think this thread is worth reading for many.  First of all, headline inflation was brought down by energy - particularly energy services - which makes sense given that we know oil prices rose in June...
4444 2018-07-12 15:31:09 What have I told you about you and comedy? It’s like oil and water.


4445 2018-07-12 15:31:08 Lot of pressure to keep oil price down a bit.

Venezuela sells the oil to China, swaps the debt for food and other imports

Is how it works

Not what you think it works

The same with the Amerikan debt...
4455 2018-07-12 15:30:10 Absolutely correct.

Who could possibly argue with that.

Russia putting extra 20 billion into weaponry paid for with German money buying oil and gas.
4456 2018-07-12 15:30:08 “Your kids don’t say ‘maintenance required’ when they ask for a hug.” @GinaGrad when @adamcarolla said changing your car’s oil is ‘like hugging your kids: you can never do it too much’, said you could change the oil every time you drive it around the block.

4489 2018-07-12 15:26:38 #lrt I hope the 2.4 billions, the Somali admin in Ethiopia gets for allowing Oil to be extracted, will also be used to develop the central/southern parts of the region such as Godey. The least developed yet with most resources & fertile land. Enough focus on Jigjiga & Dire Dhawa.

4504 2018-07-12 15:24:52 Thin crust is fresher. But (at least in the late nineties) all other Hut crusts were frozen disks that I had to cover in oil and put in the Retarder. Is Papa John's crust worse than that? (This is a genuine question, not a defense of Papa John's.)
4505 2018-07-12 15:24:49 You can actually love someone more for whatever reason(s) or even none at all! Yeah I always say even Jesus loved John more than his other apostles (John 19:26) & guess what only John, who was thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil btw, died a natural death. Others were martyred!

I promised you forever
But if I could remember

Requires goat and palm oil
To appease your feeble pride
Your deceitful lips 
Brought me into your trap
4507 2018-07-12 15:24:34 I heard you are no longer using yeast sources of oil.  What are you currently using as sources for fish and oil in feed?

4547 2018-07-12 15:21:44 Donald Trump is totally in the tank for Russia. He's a Russian stooge, nothing more than a puppet. That's why he went in front of NATO and told them to spend more on their military stop buying gas and oil from their enemy, Russia.
4548 2018-07-12 15:21:35 Stephen is an idiot.  Trump said we are protecting Germany from Russia and Germany is giving Billions to Russia for oil helping Russias economy.  Trump is right about Germany.  Its the American taxpayer that us paying for Germany’s protection!

4558 2018-07-12 15:20:30 Thanks. IMHO state's support for Novatek's LNG projects is a way of establishing the balance of power in Russian energy sector: Novatek -leader in LNG , Gazprom -monopoly in pipeline export and Rosneft' - green light for further expansion in oil sector.

4629 2018-07-12 15:14:12 That’s a lot of scenes!! Have an awesome day Cast & Crew!! Looking forward to Mr Filewych’s work! 
4630 2018-07-12 15:14:12 I do see your point, but we also have diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia for their oil over the past 70+ years...doesnt mean we're friends or allies.
4631 2018-07-12 15:14:10 You're posting in a thread of Trump supporters.  They know damn well I'm not posting lies.  You need to sell your snake oil on your side!
4632 2018-07-12 15:13:59 No, that's what I love about it. I sometimes do one with walnut oil - that makes a great dressing for a pear and blue cheese salad.
4633 2018-07-12 15:13:59 Any chance of you informing people about the importance of using the correct oil? That's another area where people get ripped off by garages
4634 2018-07-12 15:13:54 The paper analyzes the Nigerian experience from the discovery of oil in1956 and pinpoints the adverse socio-economic impact ofoil discovery onthe Nigerian economy. The paper also examines the discovery of
oil in Ghana, Sierra Leoneandongoing exploration for oil discovery in Lib.

4638 2018-07-12 15:13:38 Kinda want to LOL at the idea of sports betting content. 99.9% snake oil, let's call it for what it is. It's not DFS or poker where you're playing against other people and potentially winnable.
4639 2018-07-12 15:13:34 Miranda Panda is an innocent baby oil and glitter covered patsy in the government's authoritarian witch hunt of Stormy Daniels. These are the times that try men's souls, for sure.
4640 2018-07-12 15:13:22 Justin Trudeau has zero intentions on building a pipeline. He’s in bed with the big US money that wants our oil to flow south of the border at basement prices do they can sell at world market price. If OPEC is right and a shortage is coming. Simple math. The world needs oil!
4641 2018-07-12 15:13:21 My heart must be a bottle of sesame oil
4642 2018-07-12 15:13:15 i said it before but low oil is NASDAQ positive. in particular
4643 2018-07-12 15:13:12 You don’t have plenty of oil
You have tar sands but not a great deal
US oil production peaked in 1970 
Jesus do some research before you tweet bollocks

4646 2018-07-12 15:13:03 Curious why nobody is talking about piping clean (cleaner than other fossil fuels, anyway), cheap, & Canadian natural gas here from that pipeline terminal just across the Bridge in Port Elgin. Atlantic Canada & New England are about the only places where heating oil is popular.
4647 2018-07-12 15:12:59 ...headline not exactly selling Toronto.  Ugh.

That said, let's see a repeat of Iowa this weekend.  I wont even complain if you decide to go 1/2 instead this time.

4650 2018-07-12 15:12:31 WTI/Brent trading chatroom update #OOTT :  Tempers flare as losing traders of last few days whine on about the rigged oil markets. Bitter comments persist that "technicals don't matter now" (LOL) and much snark is thrown. No one believes giddy reports of recent substantial gains.
4651 2018-07-12 15:12:28 You are being too soft with Cruz .  you need to emphasize that he is in Texas to pocket oil money and nothing more . a non Texan in Texas to fatten up his wallet .  corporate interest 101 .
4652 2018-07-12 15:12:27 I be telling you.. keep my holy oil with me always lol
4653 2018-07-12 15:12:27 I wish you a very good 15 days Ken 
4654 2018-07-12 15:12:21 Kind of reminds me of Lurch from The Addams Family. He is a greasy snake oil salesman.

4658 2018-07-12 15:12:11 Trump opened up Anwar for oil drilling and opened coal mines and now for the first time America produces more energy than it uses and is a net exporter, and has withdrawn from the Paris Accord which was blatantly unfair and saved billions of taxpayer dollars. Way ahead of Obama!
4659 2018-07-12 15:12:11 Hope this means free oil
4660 2018-07-12 15:12:07 Did he mention the oil and ammunition trade between #Turkey and #ISIS too?

4665 2018-07-12 15:11:28 Trump you will get what you see, no political correct when he want to fight for USA. To Schumer if he is so loyal to Putin why he is demanding from NATO to investigate the business deals of Merkel with Putin. She is buying oil & gas from the Nation that they are against & should
4666 2018-07-12 15:11:26 ぜに誕！！
4667 2018-07-12 15:11:24 The nat side will never stop whingeing about oil. They'll dredge up their grievance about the McCrone report, regardless of what the man himself says about it. It's ingrained now, and dislodging SNP lies is nigh on impossible.

4669 2018-07-12 15:11:11 1) On the fallacy of “data is the new oil” analogy. I understand that all analogies fail at some point, and I do think that there is at least a little merit in the analogy (data is quickly.becoming the backbone of our economy), but the analogy still fails in very important ways.
4670 2018-07-12 15:11:09 Trump was right. Russia won't wait five years whilst Germany nudges up it's spending at Glacial pace. All the while it funds Russian arms throigh buying Russian Oil and Gas
4671 2018-07-12 15:11:09 Can females work at the oil rigs bc if they can count me tf in
4672 2018-07-12 15:11:09 My grandpa always does all my car maintenance so when I actually get up and get my oil changed I feel accomplished asf
4673 2018-07-12 15:11:02 Trust me America has plenty of oil.I am sure you have oil. Yes I am a Deplorable. A Independent so what
4674 2018-07-12 15:10:59 So what? We can’t support our allies in NATO because they buy oil? We buy Middle East oil and the US has no problem defending the world against them every chance they get.
4675 2018-07-12 15:10:58 Why is them investing heavily in clean energy a bad thing? It means they can then buy LESS oil from Russia. Just like you want. Trump quoted they buy 60% of their energy from Russia. But why I'm trying to explain this to a bot is beyond me.

4679 2018-07-12 15:10:36 Oh, and Clove oil on the tooth until you get there.
4680 2018-07-12 15:10:31 The same should be said what's good if the US is still dependent on Saudi Arabia oil and be  dictated what policy is in the middle East
4681 2018-07-12 15:10:30 Maybe if this lop spent less money on beard oil and taco bell he could afford to buy a cell phone. Instead, he'll stand there with his poor posture and knees locked like the lame he is. ZZ Top without the talent lookin piece of trash. He got feminine hips.
4682 2018-07-12 15:10:29 Ditto for DHA. Fish oil supplements only work because the fish ate the algae which actually produce DHA.

4684 2018-07-12 15:10:22 Only those who work with Oil 
4685 2018-07-12 15:10:07 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
4686 2018-07-12 15:09:54 I endorse your fundamental point.  1910s WWI, smallpox  30s Great Depression 1940s WWII  1950s Korean War 1960s Vietnam 1950s/60s threat of nuclear war social unrest 70s oil crises & economic distress 80s disco (ok, kidding) ... Part of being America is being always in crisis.
4687 2018-07-12 15:09:54 Oil goes quiet when hot. Also fry each batch for 7-8 minutes for best results. Maintain temp as high.
4688 2018-07-12 15:09:46 Congrats on the signing. Nnpc please process opl226 for copl/ shoreline. We have been waiting 2 years if you inc dpr. Ready to drill for proven oil and earn Nigeria money . All we need is psc. Not a great way to get New inward investment in oil and gas sector with such delays?
4689 2018-07-12 15:09:44 There's a 1/2 Trillion at stake in Russian oil to be shared out once all sanctions are dropped which is why Tillerson was chosen initially. Pipelines through Syria are another issue which is why Qatar was labelled a terrorist state, Assad propped up etc etc. Dirty geopolitics 
4690 2018-07-12 15:09:42 I saw an article yesterday about them upping production.  Saw another one about the USA about to become the worlds largest producer of oil.  Please make up your mind on what is the story with oil.

4698 2018-07-12 15:09:00 Is it due to fall in ROE in the intervening period and impairments on Oil n Gas ?Another cycle of   impairments in Digital ?
4699 2018-07-12 15:08:54 Agreed. But, should apply to the subsidies Oil companies receive. Level playing field for all
4700 2018-07-12 15:08:48 Many countries buy Russian oil,  it's the only thing keeping russia afloat

4702 2018-07-12 15:08:41 I just took profits on my oil short, up 10%. I don't want to get too greedy, on the first leg down.
4703 2018-07-12 15:08:39 Just come for a massage, the oil mixed with the pressure takes that shit right off. 
4704 2018-07-12 15:08:39 Iran will do its best to ensure security of oil supply to India by offering "flexible measures" to boost bilateral trade. 

Iran is the third-biggest oil supplier to India &has offered refiners incentives including almost-free shipping and an enhanced credit period on oil sales.
4705 2018-07-12 15:08:37 It's either a bottle of wine or olive oil lol.
4706 2018-07-12 15:08:36 The only thing mistie is your understanding of the facts the gelatinous carrot coloured scrotum you elected is just bereft of facts.
No one pays into NATO
Germany energy from Russias oil is 9%
The pipeline has operated for over 10 years
The 2% of GDP spending was agreed by Dubya
4707 2018-07-12 15:08:31 BREAKING: #Ireland just voted to #divest fromfossil fuels as the planet’s first country. They‘re withdrawing billions from climate-wrecking oil, coal & gas corporations.

4711 2018-07-12 15:08:09 miss jane, maybe its just me but baby oil makes the world go round !!
4712 2018-07-12 15:08:07 Also, why in the hell do people believe in a misleading promise to cut taxes by 10 cents on a commodity that is priced as unstickily as petroleum? All this does is create a gap for big oil to devour and expand their margin at Ontario's expense.

4716 2018-07-12 15:07:54 There is a higher principle than pro- or against- science: it's self interest. These companies are self-interested in delaying realization, action and responsibility on climate change AND they are interested in scientific advances that can help them suck oil out of the ground.

4758 2018-07-12 15:04:14 NATO is military alliance.  It shouldn't be concerned how countries trade for natural gas in their own regions.  Do they tell the US where to buy gas and oil? No.
4759 2018-07-12 15:04:09 Yes I'm sure Putin is real happy that President Trump is telling Germany to quit buying Russian oil and buy it from NATO countries.
4760 2018-07-12 15:04:04 What don’t people understand about the fact that in the early stages only the well off have means to purchase these newly developed cars and should be encouraged to do so? Btw These subsidies are nothing compared to oil and gas subsidies.
4761 2018-07-12 15:04:04 Is this a similar situation to what you were talking about on @MacroVoices where you showed how Iranian oil was being sold as Iraqi oil before the #JCPOA came into being?

4764 2018-07-12 15:04:01 Thank you for sharing. This is so important to ensure that all animals are considered in disasters. As we listen this morning to public health challenges of disasters, we must realise that animals, too, are exposed post-disaster to mould, oil, smoke, and others. @WolfChica #HazWS

4779 2018-07-12 15:02:54 Drink a lot of water. Also you can drink cinnamon water heated in a pot or the microwave and add sugar for taste. It will help with any nauseous feelings. Any cinnamon is good, but cinnamon oil works the best.
4780 2018-07-12 15:02:51 I'd love to hear your long-term plan for helping energy companies transition to more sustainable resources than oil & gas.

4787 2018-07-12 15:02:21 #Africa-#India: The study lends credence to the fact that bilateral trade has been anchored on the rise in crude oil imports from Africa, reinforced by the simultaneous growth in India’s exports of refined petroleum products creating a symbiotic relationship between the regions.

4795 2018-07-12 15:01:40 Though his actual quote is "...when Germany makes a massive _oil and gas_ deal with Russia..."

Anyway, I think he knows not what he talks of and as such we cannot really find the right data to confirm or deny. I don't think Nord Stream 2 is a good idea personally.

4805 2018-07-12 15:00:57 Germany buys 9% of their gas from Russia. The US imports 3.8% of its crude oil from Russia and 1/3 of its oil from OPEC. Is that a threat to NATO? And who the hell are you to tell sovereign nations how much they must spend on defense. Other countries have social nets to fund!

4839 2018-07-12 14:59:09 agreed, but easier to convince people one idea at a time... and i do think it is easier and more universal to set the values first (equal opportunity) and THEN point out that the oil analogy is flawed, which opens up new ways to act, while knowing exactly what you want and why

4855 2018-07-12 14:58:18 Chuck, get serious. Trump asked allies to increase their NATO spending, as is expected, which helps strengthen our alliance.  He’s obtained 14 billion already.

4856 2018-07-12 14:58:16 HA is water-based moisture so I imagine if you have high porosity hair it would work the same way it does for the skin.

4895 2018-07-12 14:54:23 1200 barrels capacity on site; so when will we see a tanker? It’s 2.5 days of pumping; much of which may be crud rather than crude. Waste tankers or oil tankers. Must be soon if flowing at 400 bopd

4898 2018-07-12 14:54:15 No hun. It is not. What causes heart disease is vegetable oil. So if the meat is cooked in vegetable oil then yes. But corn and flour is horrible for our bodies. Not the meat. Sugar and carbs is America's killer. Finally medical drs even cardiologist are jumping on board also.
4899 2018-07-12 14:54:08 Most of the world would consider an understanding of calculus to be a marker for "smartness."

I would argue, however, that my need to bring integrals to bear when figuring out which of my new oil company's introductory pricing offers to choose is NOT a marker for "smartness."

4908 2018-07-12 14:53:15 I will do that since you are my favorite sub shop. You make subs the way they are supposed to be done. I would like to make one suggestion though if that is cool. Teach your employees how to douse the subs in oil and vinegar like it's done in NJ. ;-)
4909 2018-07-12 14:53:12 To set the numbers straight: In 2017 only 24% of Germanys energy consumption was gas, 40% came from Russia. That means 9,6% of Russian gas in the overall consumption. If we add oil from Russia the total share is 23%, still far from 70% GERonEconomy

4929 2018-07-12 14:52:03 You used to import 22 million barrels a day up until 2010 but you have used enhanced drilling techniques and have cut your dependence on foreign oil in half and now import 7 million barrels a day, by 2020 you will be back at 22 million imports due to depletion

4937 2018-07-12 14:51:31 Unbelievable, I can’t understand how you think you can tell Germany where to buy energy from. What if they told us we can’t buy oil from Saudi Arabia because of their views on Israel? Would that be ok?

4949 2018-07-12 14:50:18 Obama sanctions had a carve out specifically for Russian oil and gas.

Trump sanctions cut into it.  But EU didn't follow.  They still buy RU oil and gas.

5003 2018-07-12 14:44:28 So because they participate in the market and realize buying oil from Russia is their best option they're supporting Russia? Is the US supporting Venezuela, China, and Saudi Arabia because we trade with them? Ridiculous point guys.

5032 2018-07-12 14:42:29 NATO countries need to buy Russian gas and oil and forget defense
First there was Hitler with rockets and nukes
Then Russia with rockets and satellites
Russian natural resources beats Nikola Tesla free energy conspiracy
5033 2018-07-12 14:42:27 Ok, oil & gas in Europe comes either from Russia or the middle east.Toady Trump has declared the middle east enemies especially OPEC. so that leaves his close personal friend Vlad in Russia, Enemy to NATO but friend to America go figure,now where do you think EU should buy fuel?

5035 2018-07-12 14:42:20 From the bottom of my heart I'd like to say thank you Conte.
Thank you for that 13 game win run.
Thank you for that magical and unexpected title win.
Thank you for the passion you showed on the touchline that transferred to us fans.
A shame we became oil&water.
Truly Thank you.

5042 2018-07-12 14:41:18 Every country is allowed to handle their own defense how they see fit!
Buying oil from an adversary is strategic, that adversary has to weigh going to war vs. losing income
Saying all the countries need to spend 4% on their military is stupid

5045 2018-07-12 14:40:48 interesting! all commodities aren’t impervious to those “real “changes , yet the oil price is wavering all the time & susceptible to change even if an insane president tweets about some lies or crazy plan !
5046 2018-07-12 14:40:40 There are 4 types of buddhi , gandhaga (like phosphorous will ignite on exposure), karpoora (camphor ignition on  touch), karee (coal - add oil,  blow hard, it will ignite), kadhali (plantain/banana -  will get doused). Intellectuals when invited! When they return home???

5060 2018-07-12 14:39:31 OK, but the analogy is unhelpful on many levels because its confusion of rival (oil) and nonrival (data) and leads us into counter-productive ideas like paying people for their personal data ...

5072 2018-07-12 14:38:26 Same here my back is worse than yours, I'm even thinking of going to see a dermatologist. But in the meantime I bath with dove soap and moisturise with epimax mixed with tea tree oil. My chest doesn't break out a lot but my back mostly breaks out around my periods
5073 2018-07-12 14:38:07 Well, part of the reason for defence requirements is American invasions in the Middle East, & part of the trade issues is the fact that the US didn’t want to let Saddam trade oil in euros, thereby falsely propping up the dollar, so maybe America should pay to minimise the effects
5074 2018-07-12 14:38:06 Life is made of change. Better to embrace it and to enjoy its good sides than to fight it and be miserable about it. Oil is a natural resource that is slowly running out. It will only become worse.

5080 2018-07-12 14:37:32 Obviously not, but it was just to counteract your “you can’t be brilliant and a knob” point. 

His cars will be shit until the day that we run out of oil. And then they’ll be the best cars on the market, right?
5081 2018-07-12 14:37:32 The problem with high oil prices is that it further encourages Permian production and the associated “ free “ nat gas . Is the scheduled additional  Permian pipeline capacity enough to fix the Permian, WAHA, Opal problem ? @BrynneKKelly @zerohedge
5082 2018-07-12 14:37:31 Getting my oil changed gives me anxiety cuz I know they’re gonna come out with a laundry list of things wrong with my car and confront me about how and why I’m driving around like this 
5083 2018-07-12 14:37:30 Don’t you think America is tired of picking up the tab for all those countries that don’t pay their fair share?? Paying to protect Germany from Russia while they are getting getting oil pipelined to them from RUSSIA??? What’s wrong with this picture??? Really???

5090 2018-07-12 14:36:53 Its,a global price.

I'm a petroleum engineer.

Everything Trump is doing with US oil is to keep global price low.

Ru depends on oil gas for Gov revenue  

This is why the EU paying billions to Putin for oil/gas while we pay for 50,000 troops in Germany is so egregious

5093 2018-07-12 14:36:31 While the oil is in your hair, throw a hair dryer cap on for 30 min on medium warm. I have been told that hearing the hair allows the oil to penetrate the keratin better. Fluffs up the cuticles that overlay each other like scales and allows the oil to get to the keratin.

5097 2018-07-12 14:36:07 For many years the niceties of diplomacy have not convinced the EU to open their markets, keep their commitments to NATO and avoid over dependency on Russia's oil and gas. Maybe plain words will work better.

5102 2018-07-12 14:35:46 Epidemic of hopelessness - no wonder, considering the fact that we trade lives for oil, as if the whole world were blind, in the words of Chris Cornell

5115 2018-07-12 14:34:31 After WW2, America committed to being the policeman of the world by protecting everyones trade lines, for free.

Reason:  we needed allies for cold war (which is now over), and we needed to keep shipping lanes open for ME oil (which is now irrelevent thanks to shale/fracking).

Germany makes oil deal with Russia, who is basically why NATO exists: Fact I don't understand how people don't see how absurd and unfair to America this is.  The only explanation is that people's hatred for Trump is more than love of country.

5164 2018-07-12 14:29:50 Do you mind if I ask what you used? I've tried sea salt soaks, aspirin paste, tea tree oil, and neosporin. Out of all of those, I think the aspirin paste helped the most. I honestly just keep forgetting about it. I've only had it 3-4 months so I think it's just still "mad" lol

5169 2018-07-12 14:29:26 To start with...
- Weaken America’s alliances + EU by attacking NATO
- Slow global economy w/ trade wars
- Reduce global demand for US-made goods
- Destabilizing MidEast to increase oil prices (RU’s economy depends on it)
- Make it hard for Trump successor to repair damage

5298 2018-07-12 14:17:23 Case in point. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE. Those neighboring countries get along, for the most part. But our presence there allows us proximity to the world's largest oil reserves.

We get less than 15% of our oil from them. But the world economy depends on that oil.

5305 2018-07-12 14:16:50 Stew can be healthy? Now, soup eh. I think @Nezifah has vegan recipes posted.

You can do the tomato-pepper spice base w/o Maggi/knorr (this part is vegan) cooked in a little oil and then bake fish/chicken and steam veggies on the side for the week.
5306 2018-07-12 14:16:48 I hope you're right. But with what we're allowing here at home i dunno. We're breaking treaties for private companies (oil pipelines over native American land). So we're setting precedents. 

I truly hope you're right,  but i don't know if being right will be enough.
5307 2018-07-12 14:16:47 Trump the Russians tool- he attacks nato - & Germany for oil debt -while China holds trillions of Americans debt in treasury bonds-that trump created-trump is clueless

5333 2018-07-12 14:14:54 Thanks for your question.  That dependency cuts both ways!  The European countries become dependent on Russia for oil and gas, while Russia becomes dependent on their payments.  Mutual dependency.  NATO was originally formed to counter Soviet threat...

5338 2018-07-12 14:14:18 Then we should all stop paying Israel and the middle East for oil. Since we have been at war with them.

Your use to WW1 and WW2 makes you the out of loop pathetic person.

5340 2018-07-12 14:13:57 Beliefs are often like oil and water. I wish everyone peace and serenity; however, assimilation takes having similar and harmonious beliefs otherwise it becomes an invasion.
5341 2018-07-12 14:13:56 That 2% isn’t a fee paid to NATO, it’s the entire defense budget of a country.  Why shouldn’t Germany buy energy from Russia?  We buy oil from the guys that knocked down the WTC.

5344 2018-07-12 14:13:49 Fuel theft is a crime so should fuel fixing be! It’s about time the government takes action to stop gas stations from raising the price of fuel for no reason. Ie holidays or like in Sudbury every Tuesday even when oil stays the same or worse drops in price!
5345 2018-07-12 14:13:41 They’ll cut off their oil. That’s all they can realistically do. I don’t think ‘The Guns of August’ is brewing.

5349 2018-07-12 14:13:00 To be honest that's why I think the carb/ seed oil combo probably causes mental illness on a growing scale, there's no explanation for why we are not jsut celebrating and getting on with  helping people otherwise.
5350 2018-07-12 14:12:59 So I did some googling and that reference might have wound up sounding like a complete non sequitur

5360 2018-07-12 14:12:26 It's always weird that there are adults that can't cook.  Then compare cooking to things that don't occur often. Like...you eat everyday.

5384 2018-07-12 14:09:53 Imagine the negative press the Trump administration would receive if Trump would agree to purchase billions in gas or oil from Russia. Yet Germany is doing that while Russia is under a trade embargo

5390 2018-07-12 14:09:24 I think an important issue of our time is to discuss why round pizza's come in square boxes. Personally I think it's the "big pizza" cartels idea to use less ingredients at the expense of the consumer. This should be what wars are fought over, not "oil" or "terrorism".

5394 2018-07-12 14:08:53 In NL the last Conservative gov led and directed by Danny Williams, spent tax and $26bn in oil revenue  plus added a $13bn hydro dam boondoggle on the population! The second line of NL budget is now debt service. Debt @ $28k/person + $13bn Muskrat Falls is what he lowered on us.

5435 2018-07-12 14:04:02 Hey idiot, who gets hurt the most by a better funded NATO and Trump telling Germany to stop buying oil from Russia?  Suppose he’s just setting the tone letting Putin know he’s serious before he arrives while also telling NATO members what they need to hear either way? I’ll wait
5436 2018-07-12 14:03:58 Myara energy (ex-Essar) have also said they will go to zero. To do with their shareholders which include Rosneft and Trafigura. The big question though is what the national oil companies like IOC, HPCL, etc. Would expect Bharat to also go to zero.
5437 2018-07-12 14:03:53 Compared with 2017, what do you think the volume of #oil and #gas transactions activity in 2018 will be? Higher, The same, Lower, Doesn’t apply #EYOGDeals

5439 2018-07-12 14:03:51 But the powers that be in this state seem to be against the well being of the state and more inline with corporate interest of oil and big pharma. Fallin has failed us once again. You can see that right?

5441 2018-07-12 14:03:44 Trump's ticked off because he tried to bully the Germans into buying American gas and oil. They refused and will continue to buy same from Russia.

5444 2018-07-12 14:03:21 It’s possible a product you’re using is irritating/overdrying the skin up there, or *something something* pollen. If you mix lavender essential oil (five drops or so) with a spray bottle of water, it will ease the itch.
5445 2018-07-12 14:03:19 HOW??? Under Mohammed Reza Shah, for example, Parliament and the Prime Minister were overthrown to nationalize the oil industry and give it to the British government!

Tech cos, early on, are hard to decipher from snake oil, especially for govt. What evidence do you see that could have been acted on?

5527 2018-07-12 13:55:55 It simple Guy, Russia is only a threat if it has oil to fuel their tanks and planes. Therefore Germany is buying it all up to prevent the Russians from using their own stock. Its genius I tell you

5532 2018-07-12 13:55:17 It hurts other EMs more than it hurts India. Standalone, the effects on India are mixed. Strong dollar helps exports of IT companies in rupee terms and depresses India's import bill of oil and gold. But increases cost of servicing dollar denominated debt.

Saying he wasn't "as bad" ignores that Obama was terrible. Half the country takes turns asleep. That's why the US is able to commit atrocities.

5546 2018-07-12 13:52:50 WTF is the matter with you Trump? You have no business going to Europe and stirring up trouble for other countries. 
Luckily for you your neighbour Canada cannot invade or destroy you but Russia can do that to Germany and so yes Nato is important but so is oil important to G.

5565 2018-07-12 13:51:24 Are you THICK or just intentionally trying to be this stupid?  So why don't you stop US imports from Russia on Oil and Gas if your arguments holds any water.

5572 2018-07-12 13:50:54 In T-world “protection” is a mob racket. He’s the boss. Possibly working up an oil/Lng deal with Germany? Containing Russian influence is in everyone’s interest-except For Putin and a well known debtor/developer.

5575 2018-07-12 13:50:40 my opinion is BMTC can never be profit making until they go electric.
the no. of parts and oil/fuel used in conventional buses are very high.

user satisfaction/speed and being on time...is another thing.
5576 2018-07-12 13:50:35 What about Saudi Arabia,Trumps oil friend .... and 9/11 ....

5578 2018-07-12 13:50:16 4. He didn’t “attack” our allies. He stated a fact.Yes,he went after Germany harder.They are the richest Country & pay 1.24% They have given Russia billions& Russia will supply 80%-90% gas/oil & we’re supposed to protect them against Russia?No proof of Collusion,doesn’t count
5579 2018-07-12 13:50:06 Um....can someone remind Herr Dicktator where we get OUR oil from please? 
5580 2018-07-12 13:49:58 I am aware that it can be done as  "Low carb" high fat vegan presumably with copious coconut and olive oil.   I havents seen anything that suggets it actually truly works as a high carb, low fat vegan , though the suggestion seems to be its nearly " No fat vegan which sounds dire

5586 2018-07-12 13:48:59 Now the oil thing was kinda bullshit but really and honestly, don't quote me on this, but if my memory serves me correctly, they refused to sell oil to us or someone around them, I can't remember exactly tho so take this with a grain of salt
5587 2018-07-12 13:48:56 What about Korea Gina? Lend lease was lovely but it took 2 years. We needed oil and food but we needed bullets, tanks, planes and men to fight, again, it took you years. We owe you nothing, especially not to bow and scrape to the most ridiculous president you ever had.
5588 2018-07-12 13:48:50 Oil change ...because the last time at Jiffy Lube type place they messed up the drain plug and we had a little leak.

No Mosq or Madrasa shud get Foreign money.
5595 2018-07-12 13:48:07 We pay the lions share for everything. Time to pay up. Now Germany is owned by Russia for their oil and gas. And we protect Germany from Russia? Why?

5599 2018-07-12 13:48:03 It is Germany's decision to work with Russia for oil. Germany doesn't produce much of its own.
You & Putin must be planning on war if you want to make it 4%. There is no other reason for such a bump.
NATO agreements are being met as scheduled.

5614 2018-07-12 13:45:32 Total bullsh*t  

Globalists are Communists and you want United States to protect you?  Russia expanding itself into Europe keep buying their gas and oil which helps Russia grow militarily and it  keeps Putin & Mullahs in power 

Syrian genocide by Iranian backed Russia in Syria

5617 2018-07-12 13:45:29 They finally agreed to pay their share and he’s taking rightful credit for making it happen.  And who’s the main person that’s hurt by a better funded NATO?   “PUTIN ”.  And if they stop getting so much oil from Russia like he called out, Putin hurt again!  You’re welcome 
5618 2018-07-12 13:45:21 Nothing, and that is because as I mentioned, Alex is a snake oil salesmen :)

5625 2018-07-12 13:44:45 Hoy reply ka naman
5626 2018-07-12 13:44:36 THATS CALLED "FREE-MARKET" TRADE....and its good for business in regards to competition as competition keeos consumer prices down giving countries a "choice" in trade - as to who will supply their oil at the most competitive price . its a win-win situation for consumers as well
5627 2018-07-12 13:44:34 Kinda of like the absurdity of continuing to purchase oil from a country in which 17 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from wouldn't you say...
5628 2018-07-12 13:44:32 What will NATO jets and tanks run on, olive oil?
5629 2018-07-12 13:44:27 so i have to get the oil changed on the work truck,
5630 2018-07-12 13:44:26 And olive oil is toxic
5631 2018-07-12 13:44:25 TRUMP: “Germany is being held captive by Russian oil!”

You mean like the way the  U.S. is held captive by Saudi oil?

TRUMP: “No, that’s different.”
5632 2018-07-12 13:44:22 It was reported they get 9% of their oil from the pipeline
Also this pipeline was installed in 2002 or 2004 which was way before the problem with Crimea. Fucktrump
5633 2018-07-12 13:44:06 AND.. Trump berates Germany for using Russian oil via a pipeline. Was Trump angry bec Putin worked behind Trump's back or bec he thought he would get t same deal with Russia. News Flash! Trump add Putin to t list of foreign leads that seem like your friend but beat u like a drum

5638 2018-07-12 13:43:31 The energy issue is a problem in need of attention. We don't disagree with that. On the other hand, Trump dropped sanctions on Russia so they can drill more oil to make billions. So he's a hypocrite to call foul. He kisses Putin's ass. Putin meddled YUGE in a US election, period.

5642 2018-07-12 13:43:07 its the Film Width shader in Octane, designed specifically to simulate oil slicks and soap bubbles haha
5643 2018-07-12 13:42:24 This is always a concern when oil is discovered, this reminds me the tension between Malawi and Tanzania over prospects of oil in Lake Malawi.
5644 2018-07-12 13:42:18 And Germany buying all that oil from Russia.

5653 2018-07-12 13:41:07 60%of our oil needs are met by other countries.. hmmmm Does that make us captives? China owns a lot of our debts I guess we are captive to them too.. Reading should be required for the job
5654 2018-07-12 13:40:59 Right, increasing troop presence in europe, working with poland for a new military base, increasing supply of oil and natural gass cutting Russian influence, and santioning russian...you are dishonest.
5655 2018-07-12 13:40:46 Britain is far and away Ireland's biggest trading partner, accounting for 50 per cent of exports from the Republic. Ireland is virtually entirely dependent upon its larger neighbour for energy, importing 90 per cent of its oil and more than 90 per cent of its gas from the UK.
5656 2018-07-12 13:40:43 Avg gas price $1.33 x 55L tank = $73.15 fill ($290+/mth)
@fordnation's 10¢ promise means $1.23 x 55L tank = $67.65 ($270+/mth)
So $240/yr in gas "savings" is worth destroying green initiatives & less dependence on oil, huh?
5657 2018-07-12 13:40:39 Russia is fully entitled like every other country to pursue setting up pipelines and selling their own oil in trade to other countries as well just like every other country does like SAUDI ARABIA.

5667 2018-07-12 13:39:53 Omg. Germany is not paying protection money you ignorant tool. Oil is a small part of their energy mix - they are doing far more with renewable resources than we are. You say the stupidest things and Congress enables you.  Our country is sick. @SenateDems @SenateGOP

5676 2018-07-12 13:39:05 The thing about #Trump with Russia. Talks real nice thin sanctions the hell out of Russia. Has three countries drop Russia for oil, and starts buying from the US. Tell German to quit giving all your money to Russia your enemy and having us protect you. Isn't OIL Russian's economy
5677 2018-07-12 13:39:04 I need to get some more coconut oil.
5678 2018-07-12 13:39:03 Oil is retesting yesterday's lows. What for another snap-back rally off that 70 level, even if it breaks first.

5680 2018-07-12 13:38:58 If you look at the futures on Oil out more than 6-12 months this current euphoria over the rise in Oil prices starts to look a little short sited
5681 2018-07-12 13:38:39 We used coconut oil and even chia seeds in some of the recipes, but sadly, I think the flour base, whether with or without gluten, of all the treats takes them out of the running for Keto friendly. But they’re small, so if she is ever treats herself, this could be the way!
5682 2018-07-12 13:38:35 And Adam uses a fresh disposable double-blade and Nivea sensitive skin cream. Sometimes I will put a little bit of Temperance on as a pre-shave oil. Hope that helps!

5684 2018-07-12 13:38:31 Just so happens that coal, oil & steel industries the Obama regulations killed also need better negotiated trade deals to save those industries.  Trump also reversed the EPA regs that (INTENTIONALLY!!) halted our natural resources & energy growth.

5689 2018-07-12 13:38:18 We’ve always known that we had incredible oil and gas reserves here in the US but the previous Administrations thought it best to use other countries reserves first and keep ours for a rainy day!

5694 2018-07-12 13:37:36 Not snobby at all! If I was getting upset over it, I wouldn't bother. I just saw him going around tryna be a downer and thought I'd draw to light what a waste of time it is on his part because one look at his profile makes any words he says cut like avocado oil spread.

5701 2018-07-12 13:37:19 @wallacefor119 I read an older tweet of yours; your view may have changed. CBD oil is legal to purchase as of 6/25/18. However, anyone wishing to purchase must be very aware that quality varies greatly. Careful research is absolutely necessary before purchase.

5706 2018-07-12 13:37:03 I mean you can use "new sports" as a descriptor when describing esports, but to throw away a now standard term used industry-wide with mainstream adoption because it is easier for you to snake oil people and also call yourself a "pioneer" no thanks, the term esports is just fine.

5708 2018-07-12 13:36:48 Oil hit $150 10 years ago.  Following the markets was so much more interesting & exciting back then.

5722 2018-07-12 13:35:43 Yes,  very true. We just have to make sure we carry that extra oil,  we're going to need it.  
5723 2018-07-12 13:35:43 to my friends reading this: buy me beard oil for my 21st. i dont need anything else.
5724 2018-07-12 13:35:30 If you actually researched shit you'd know oil wasn't the only reason we went there, and Latin America has always been a shit show take Mexico, for example, the country barely had law for most of "history" and even when it does the crime there is so blatantly rampant its insane

5728 2018-07-12 13:35:04 A $1.50 more in their paychecks-WOW -less consumer protection-more pollution-more oil spills in our National parks-higher consumer prices due to #Trump 's Trade Wars-higher  prices #betteroffnow is partly an illusion -some are but not for your reasons #trumpcrimefamily
5729 2018-07-12 13:35:03 Thatch pissed away billions of oil and privatisation money. This government was stuffed before it began. Brexit will make us all poor - well, probably not Richard.  But seriously, calling any elected MP evil makes you as bad as Farage et al. Update ur profile pic then.

5733 2018-07-12 13:34:13 And we buy oil from Muslims!  The world is so crazy!     When are you going to sit down with Mueller?   Hilary would’ve testified by now.

5739 2018-07-12 13:33:42 So I guess the U.S. is owned by Saudi Arabia because we buy oil from them. You're so stupid!
5740 2018-07-12 13:33:42 The Oil and Gas industry in Colorado has reduced VOC emissions by 45% from 2011-2017...even with growth hovering around 400%...and we are still working towards better practices and standards.

5758 2018-07-12 13:32:04 Sorry @torchystacos I usually love the Taco of the Month, this was an expensive miss. Truffle oil on lobster? Why? Lobster stands on its own the truffle oil ruined the flavor (and I like truffle oil, just not on lobster)
5759 2018-07-12 13:32:01 Wrong. 
NATO not paying their fair share is reprehensible. 
Germany buying billions of dollars of Russian oil and gas is reprehensible.
Why do Democrats always take the side of everyone but America’s?
5760 2018-07-12 13:31:58 The Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld Triad held power through cajoling, false moral stance & threats! The people of NATO countries & UK especially were suckered into backing US several false premises - Iraq was responsible for 9/11, it was a just war & USA held moral high ground - IT WAS OIL

5774 2018-07-12 13:30:24 I'm part German. I'm disgusted that they're in the deal to buy oil from Russia and that a previous Chancellor is making money off it. No wonder we have to give more money to NATO to offset Germany's payment to Russia. Angela Merkel is not just a dope she's a traitor.

5781 2018-07-12 13:29:43 You spend so much on the military because you are a warring nation.  You even wanted to go into Venezuela last year probably because you wanted access to their oil.  You could easily reduce your military spending and look after Americans’ health.

They use money to build up its military. Germany doesn’t even pay its share to NATO. Stop buying Germany cars

5835 2018-07-12 13:24:27 Let's see if they indeed raise production or empty the inventories? My guess it is 50/50... (especially when they need oil for air conditionning)
5836 2018-07-12 13:24:23 Drunk driver @RepMattGaetz , who took campaign money from an oil company prior to introducing a bill to dismantle the EPA, continues to call Jordan a man of integrity. Wonder if @PhilEhr or @DrZ4Congress are as confused by the meaning of the word integrity? #TimesUpJiimmyJordan
5837 2018-07-12 13:24:10 It will be the Trump-Putin Axis of Global Oil Oligarchy. Make no mistake, they have a deal and this summit is contract renewal and renegotiation time.
5838 2018-07-12 13:24:00 No because it was my stupidity for trying to unjam it while there was hot oil in it, if I was smart I would have waited for it to cool down lol but it was a Monday coming back from vacation so I was sleepy, happened at 3:45am

5841 2018-07-12 13:23:33 I doubt that was the tweet was saying . Obviously calling her dad because all she know about is a oil change  RT @12YearsAHaitian: DOES AUTOZONE REPAIR CARS?! YES OR NO?!
5842 2018-07-12 13:23:32 Cardiovascular problems have also been linked to extensive use of ibuprofen. I’m growing my own and making oil for my own medical use. There is enough evidence out there to end the prohibition imo.

5844 2018-07-12 13:23:23 Yeah I was thinking that but I wasn't sure if I was getting it confused with a Castrol oil ad they played during a WC year that had Ronaldo in and he said something about it being "leequid eengenering" I remember that because I remember making fun of his accent for 4 weeks 
5845 2018-07-12 13:23:00 Why don’t you talk about the fact Germany gets 75% of its oil from Russia?
5846 2018-07-12 13:22:58 What's the issue? We buy oil from the middle east and Venezuela. Trump borrows money from Russia.

5848 2018-07-12 13:22:48 I would tell anybody to never ever invest in oil.  That commoditie is run by criminal
5849 2018-07-12 13:22:45 Everyone buys your oil, literally everyone. Don't let political nonsense cloud your thoughts, we, the world want Iran to be part of the global community, USA is mislead and will eventually change their minds.
5850 2018-07-12 13:22:44 Actually thought we were all dead from net neutrality repeal, tax cuts, nuclear war etc etc...

5852 2018-07-12 13:22:37 Sorry that is emphatically just not true. The US has a sordid history of funding regimes or rebellious factions that serve our means in a quest of ither oil/resources, or 2establish a strategic global presence in order to maintain "peace". Go back 65years to "Iranian" revolution

5859 2018-07-12 13:22:08 Lol. You realize that none of that has changed? Gdp still below three percent; mass shootings still happening; oil gas at highest levels since 2014.

5908 2018-07-12 13:17:42 that’s fine! i switch between the two  constantly bc everything you’re learning with acrylic is applicable to oil

the main benefit to oil is giving you a full day to casually work one layer, rather than racing against the clock to get blending done

but blending is overrated
5909 2018-07-12 13:17:38 Why is a continental war inevitable? 1) We’d all still be NATO allies, so couldn’t even if we wanted to. 2) European countries are so much more dependent on each other than 70 years ago. 3) Defend ourselves from who? Russian economy depends on selling Gas and Oil to Europe.

5918 2018-07-12 13:16:37 Rupee strengthen against the US Dollar. Strong local equities, some respite in US-China trade spat and slump in crude oil prices aided the Rupee. Some of the gains were erased as Dollar index ticked higher. The Rupee ended at 68.57 vs. yesterday’s close of 68.77.

5922 2018-07-12 13:16:24 Indian Government bond prices ended higher today, as a slump in global crude oil prices eased inflation worries. Decline in US Treasury yields also boosted prices. Gains were capped as investors were cautious ahead of June CPI data.

5952 2018-07-12 13:13:48 Actually plenty in just the last 24 hours alone.
Germany buying oil and gas from Russia, instead of buying it from the USA is their choice. America has no say in the politics and choices of a foreign, sovereign nation.
5953 2018-07-12 13:13:44 How many limos do you think you'd see in Maine compared to Texas, land of the oil barons? Ted is not so good at this, is he?
5954 2018-07-12 13:13:42 70% of energy in Germany is purchased from Russia. That is a problem Germany now dependent on Russia to exist. Buy from USA we have oil and gas available

5968 2018-07-12 13:12:45 Some of the essential oil pushers will say you can use essential oils instead of sunblock. I don't remember which ones are supposed to "protect" you. I can't even with those idiots.

5971 2018-07-12 13:12:34 Listening to Bob Lonsberry on WHAM talk negatively about solar farms... He is seriously misinformed. Solar works and the environmental impact is negligible. When Oil is $125/barrel, he'll sing a different tune, guaranteed.

5975 2018-07-12 13:12:04 Fifty percent of our oil comes from nations that attacked us on 9/11. Why are spending billions in a never ending terror War there while we still do business with these governments?
5976 2018-07-12 13:11:58 Putin is doing to Germany exactly what the Democrats have done with blacks and Hispanics..........get them completely dependent, and then threaten to withhold it in exchange for subservience and compliance.  
With Putin it's gas and oil.  With Democrats it's free stuff.

5980 2018-07-12 13:11:38 Price Controls on #Oil is a strategy used by Central Banks as stealth QE when our fragile economy stalls. The history of price controls is shortages & will lead to $100 oil. Yesterday's take down on oil was obvious for anyone paying attention. @CMEGroup

5999 2018-07-12 13:09:05 Why is it that the 30 or so northern states depends on Canada also we export 40% of all oil imports to USA.
We don’t fight back we fall exactly where they want us. Without tariffs to control imports we would be steamroll into commercial oblivion.

6006 2018-07-12 13:08:35 And now are on the hook to purchase Russian oil
6007 2018-07-12 13:07:52 Could care a less what they do in the desert. Oil and gas plants don't take up nearly what you would need for solar panels to produce the same amount of energy. Also farmers can seed crops right over buried pipelines.

6019 2018-07-12 13:05:41 I Iiterally have been a little political ass bitch since I was about 10. I remember going to bed mad when I was like 11 being all ‘fuck the army they just go out to other countries to kill innocent people under the guise of ‘protecting our nation’ when they just want oil’
6020 2018-07-12 13:05:40 LMFAOOO bruh when I was literally in the gym when I typed that. I had flat stomach and baby oil on my mind for next summer haha
6021 2018-07-12 13:05:33 That reminds me, Exxon, Rex Tillerson, remember the big oil deals they had to help Puty get some Oil/Gas topside, but Obama stopped them after Crimea & east Ukraine, well, Maybe the Trumpster will allow that again, he wants price to go down, Puty needs experts

6023 2018-07-12 13:05:23 US will become the biggest producer thats a right thinking but thats not a good thing for US for long-term. Saudi Arabia try to get rid of oil production. Look for the Aramco Company that will answer it.
6024 2018-07-12 13:05:20 If oil drops, DAL is well set to benefit. This is, & always has been my top pick in the sector. Great balance sheet. Doesn't get any better
6025 2018-07-12 13:05:12 After the explosion and surging fire beginning on April 20, 2010, the rig finally collapsed and sank beneath the waves on April 22. Five thousand feet below, the Macondo wellhead continued spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico until June 15

6027 2018-07-12 13:05:07 To NATO representatives: So...we're protecting Germany, France and other countries against Russia but then Germany and other countries in Europe, are paying Russia all these millions of dollars to invest in the Russian oil pipeline!!!

6031 2018-07-12 13:04:40 Said it before say it again , if we as in Europe and the US hadn’t gone and fucked up their countries just so we could get the oil , Lybia Iran Syria etc they wouldn’t be migrating.

6037 2018-07-12 13:04:07 CRUDE: Looking for new low for our buy day cycle. But first we look for a short term peak at 71.70 area. Then additional weakness to follow at  69.70 to 69.60. Downside pivot at 69.28. #CL_F #Oil #OOTT

6055 2018-07-12 13:02:29 Seems to me the solution to this would be develop a reusable straw that still accommodates people. You could easily say banning an oil pipeline limits oil needed for energy and alternative energy is too expensive for some. Your first tweet was around scale not choking hazards.
6056 2018-07-12 13:02:28 Look your car may be stolen, but if you get it back but still insist on driving it for kilometres with a red oil indicator, you are going to knock the engine. And this is what Simon wants to tell us. Thank you, Im black and I care that this ship must not sink.
6057 2018-07-12 13:02:21 Youre subsidizing and have been the oil industry with Canadian taxes for decades and decades. Governments are useful for moving things forward
6058 2018-07-12 13:02:21 and another issue is the fact that many politicians who are championing for a large ban on these straws don’t give a fuck about deforestation or corporate pollution or oil, this is a scapegoat measure at best that will make many of our lives difficult and demonised

6061 2018-07-12 13:01:43 Let's do some price fixing, Puty needs the gas and oil price to get in a sweet spot, the govt. there depends on it, helps keep the taxes low, and they are low, he's got to have something to put on the positive list, lockup those unneeded supplies around the world

6100 2018-07-12 12:58:44 Historically, gas prices are affected by unrest in other countries .  Libya and Egypt unrest. Iran playing war games at a critical oil transfer area. Political unrest in Ukraine, Iraq, and Nigeria have increased prices. These are issues that caused spikes long before Trump.

"Totally controlled" 
Only 12.4 % of Germany's total oil consumption are actually fed by oil imports from Russia. Other imports from Russia: natural gas: 8.8 %, black coal: 3.7% (Federal Ministry of Economics, GER). POTUS needs to check his "facts".

6114 2018-07-12 12:56:54 Despite severe discount of Canadian oil to U.S. oil due to transportation bottlenecks, some Canadian oil producers are optimistic that they will be able to overcome takeaway capacity constraints as they have enough commitments on existing pipelines and refining capacity.

6138 2018-07-12 12:54:28 Im sure you could get some hop oil soak a beermat in it an lay it on a plate or saucer an the smell would drift

6141 2018-07-12 12:54:15 Giving them info about a shared mission of destroying ISIS is evidence of their influence over him? LOL! Was he influenced by them when he lessened our depends on their oil, or sold defensive arms to Ukraine, or killed hundreds of their mercenaries in Syria?
6142 2018-07-12 12:54:05 The whole idea of US Nuclear deal withdrawal was to put sanctions on Iranian Oil and sell its own Oil to India and other energy hungry countries.

6144 2018-07-12 12:54:04 Disagree. First, see Ryanair. Second, $dal just released their preliminary earnings results and they are pretty solid considering what oil did. 

1. $dal
2. $save
3. $alk

Probably would touch $ual or $aal but think $ual has huge upside potential.

6164 2018-07-12 12:52:19 The US is on track to become the world's biggest oil producer.  Energy Information Administration data released Wednesday shows the US will produce 11.8 million barrels a day next year, putting it ahead of both Saudi Arabia and Russia, the Associated Press reports.
6165 2018-07-12 12:52:10 Germany buys as much gas from Russia as the US buys oil from Saudi Arabia  (in percent), did the US stop after they flew a few airplanes into buildings here? Nope. I don't trust Russia one bit, but it's a business arrangement and Germany expands the use of renewables every year.
6166 2018-07-12 12:52:01 That when it had leaked its oil everywhere and you were u/s?
6167 2018-07-12 12:51:56 And this chart does not include oil imported for conversion to transportation fuels(gasoline and diesel) for automobiles. Its just about public utilities.
6168 2018-07-12 12:51:54 Apparently we import millions of gallons of oil from our Russian friends. I am embarrassed once again.

6176 2018-07-12 12:51:26 LOL. Trump just nominated an ex-Russian bank rep as head of DOJ criminal division - he has no experience prosecuting cases. A coal/oil lobbyist is the new EPA head, after the old one was fired for being too corrupt for even Trump!  The Swamp IS the GOP.

6179 2018-07-12 12:51:03 Canada’s oil is currently priced at a huge discount to the U.S. benchmark. The discount at which Western Canadian Select (WCS) the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands delivered at Hardisty, Alberta trades relative to WTI has been US$20, at times US$30 a barrel.
6180 2018-07-12 12:50:53 As you well know gas prices are related to several things such as commodity traders bidding the price of crude oil up.  Damage to refineries by hurricanes, pec limiting production. But you want to act stupid and pretend it’s all Trump because you assume your base is too ignorant.
6181 2018-07-12 12:50:43 Buying oil from Russia to supply your power is not smart. Especially in a military sense. What if Russia invades Europe and is about to invade Germany? *Flick* Powers off. Time to invade. How about buying oil from us? We won't invade as long as Nazi Germany never comes back.

3. Dubai does NOT get its wealth from oil, so that's just wrong.
4. Norway is a petrostate, but it's system depends less on oil than Venezuela's.

6220 2018-07-12 12:46:13 Uncertainty on future supply costs is considerable. Delivering 40 mbd new oil, and similarly for gas, in a world with strict carbon policies and focus on declining demand and the need to  reduce emissions, will be challenging, not least if the industry is bashed while delivering.
6221 2018-07-12 12:46:07 The Growth Commission Report doesn't include oil and gas revenues in its financial model for an independent Scotland. That's a good indication that the oil & gas industry isn't seen as being a significant contributor to Scotland's finances going forward.

6490 2018-07-12 12:19:14 A point missed by @klillington I believe is that data is the new Oil and in that environment having the data stored in our country brings with it other jobs such as sales, legal, etc - not just those for the building and running the centre.

6492 2018-07-12 12:19:12 @business #DaybreakAmericas: @DavidWestin @adsteel : I believe rhe proximity of Russia to Germany makes them ideal trading partners in oil like USA & Canada. Just saying!!
6493 2018-07-12 12:18:55 Price Controls on #Oil is a strategy used by Central Banks as stealth QE when our fragile economy stalls. The history of price controls is shortages & will lead to $100 oil. Yesterday's take down on oil was obvious. @CMEGroup @LukeGromen @S_Mikhailovich @Go_Rozen @andrewmaguire1
6494 2018-07-12 12:18:52 Get this stuff called Chillax.
Ridiculous name but it comes in a bottle and you drop the oil under your tongue.
Doesn't taste bad.
6495 2018-07-12 12:18:45 Except that it's American companies taking the oil in Canada, funded by Canadians.
6496 2018-07-12 12:18:29 Have we run out of all reasonable adjuncts for beer? Seems like brewers aren’t even creative anymore, there just throwing shit in and hoping it’s not disgusting. [6mo from now] “how about a used engine oil and dead seagull stout!?” (Everyone cheers).
6497 2018-07-12 12:18:08 The art of the deal was: only American money to trade oil. We will go the war. That's the deal.
6498 2018-07-12 12:18:06 And where do we get our oil?  Venezuela. Iraq. Iran. Saudi Arabia etc.   Terrorist countries.   And don’t say we can’t include Saudi Arabia since most of the hijackers on 9/11 came from that country. Just like us, for their energy Germany is biting the bullet
6499 2018-07-12 12:18:00 @POTUS: It’s sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia 

#FactCheck: It’s sadder U.S. debt to China is $1.19 trillion. That’s 19% of the $6.29 trillion in Treasury bills, notes, and bonds held by foreign countries. USA is totally “captive” to China.

6528 2018-07-12 12:15:29 My alternative?  First, stop subsidizing oil industries. Ask them to pay the same level of taxation as the average of all other companie.  Just with that, you'll find the oil price not so competitive anymore.  Perhaps clean energies will seems more affodable.

6553 2018-07-12 12:12:24 I understand the said consequences of a trade war. But the sell off in oil yesterday, I believe, was a little extreme. U.S. stockpiles decreased drastically last week and are now 4% below their average bound. I’m looking for a slight upside in oil in today’s trading. #commodities

6555 2018-07-12 12:12:14 And as far as the oil dependency is concerned, even if the US were to soon take over as the world leader in supply, it doesn't negate the fact that we've been oil dependent for the past 60+years, so a little hypocritical on @realDonaldTrump part, don't ya think?

6587 2018-07-12 12:08:40 .I think Germany getting 70% of its oil and gas from Russia means Putin can exercise tremendous leverage over Germany which compromises the security of the other NATO partners.
6588 2018-07-12 12:08:38 I don’t know Paddy Adenuga’s story, but I think if anyone at all was gifted one of the most productive oil blocks in the country, you’d be an idiot to screw it up. I would assume Valuation is dependent on the productivity of the block, which isn’t in her control.

6619 2018-07-12 12:05:40 Do you think (affordable) supply would become an issue at these volumes, say in a decade or two? Or is there a potential "sweet spot" for the oil industry, where stabilised or even falling supply could be optimal because of the volumes needed to replace depleting fields?

6631 2018-07-12 12:04:52 trump made up shit again when he said that Germany gets 70-75% of its energy from Russia. Less than 20% of the entire energy market comes from gas. Of that it's about 60% according to most sources. Add some coal and some oil. Far cry from trump's lie.

6641 2018-07-12 12:03:38 A big one:  They borrowed in foreign currency & then the price of oil (which they heavily rely upon) collapsed.  Unlike Norway, which used its oil wealth to build diversified industries (many of which are gov owned), Ven didn’t diversify.  This goes back to the 70s & earlier

6643 2018-07-12 12:03:29 Translation of events:

Bibi's meeting w/ Putin went south, he gave him enough to go & bomb as he did last night. The cartel is failing to conscript Putin.

Strategy was, entice & bully. Threaten gas & oil supply - Bibi to sweet talk - threaten again (bolster NATO monetarily)

6645 2018-07-12 12:03:04 They became clients from Rússia, highly dependent on oil and gas. Crimea is the solution
6646 2018-07-12 12:02:56 นึกว่าใคร  " ติ่ง  Baby Oil  นั่นเอง  อิอิ
6647 2018-07-12 12:02:55 He out and out lied - said Germany is dependent on Russia for 70 percent of its oil and is therefore a puppet of Russia when it fact Germany imports just 9 percent of its oil from Russia..
6648 2018-07-12 12:02:51 betul tahan lama. but it is oil; minyak atar @ oud contohnya. EDP is an alternative choice untuk yang tak suka bau yg menusuk macam oud. u are welcome
6649 2018-07-12 12:02:51 Russia has much to be concerned with. 
US will overtake them in production of crude oil. 
Germany is betting on the wrong stallion.
6650 2018-07-12 12:02:41 Guys, does CBD oil actually work for anxiety?
6651 2018-07-12 12:02:37 The sprays are oral so they work super fast. They also have gum. Anything going directly to my bloodstream is my preferred treatment. 
Nice! Are those oil blends? How are those administered?
6652 2018-07-12 12:02:26 Trump declared once India as big friend n wanted to impose ban on India's importing oil from Iran.India is a sovereign state,hence he has no locus-standi to interfere in da internal affairs of India.A super power does not supposed to subdue  a sovereign country.
6653 2018-07-12 12:02:18 There is a difference between one-time capital and an oil block that’s spewing oil aka constant stream of cash. How does one screw that up? So the two are not comparable.
6654 2018-07-12 12:01:58 I use wool dryer balls in dryer. I usually add drops of lavender- the smell is divine!
I also make my own washer liquid softener with white vinegar, water, drops of lavender. Last batch, I added a little Avon skin so soft oil L& lotion. Not totally *free but better than some.
6655 2018-07-12 12:01:47 Trump bombs Syria who Putin supports, levies harsh sanctions on Russia, has enacted policies for US to be largest oil producer which hurts Russia & anti-Trumpers pretend Trump is in cahoots w Russia, but Trump calls out Germany for buying Russian oil & anti-Trumpers cry abt it.
6656 2018-07-12 12:01:38 Is Russia really the enemy when France and Germany are paying Russia billions for oil? Serious question. @BryanDeanWright
6657 2018-07-12 12:01:36 just not true. once pipeline is up, germany is expecting a max import of 40% of oil/gas from russia. BUT: fossil energy is only 20% of our overall energy resource. so we look at total of ca.8% of our resource. THAT, we can compensate. but this maths is too complicated, right? 
6658 2018-07-12 12:01:36 Avon. Skin so soft dry oil spray in green xx
6659 2018-07-12 12:01:32 I put a drop of lavender oil on my the bottoms of my feet and also some on my chest and it has helped me a lot!!!

6661 2018-07-12 12:01:11 If there is no place for principles then why do sanctions and embargoes exist? Other countries also have oil like venezuela the usa qatar iraq iran etc
6662 2018-07-12 12:01:11 The Clarence District is replacing a cross culvert on Clarence Center, skid paving on Westwood Road, mowing in Lancaster and Clarence and tree trimming on Oil and Chip Roads.
6663 2018-07-12 12:01:02 What do you use to preserve your non-gmo canola oil? I buy your product but am concerned about synthetic antioxidants TBHQ, BHA, and BHT.
6664 2018-07-12 12:00:50 By eye, it looks like this scenario would have oil going down at about the depletion rate of existing fields.

6683 2018-07-12 11:59:28 I am just playing around with different ways of presenting the oil/gas supply side. In 280 chars, I could not fit in that "much less investment is needed in 2C compared to BAU". Even with MATs, investments will slow down. Without MATs, even more rapidly (though no scenarios).
6684 2018-07-12 11:59:20 You are being sarcastic right, please, tell me you are...because the US does not set your oil prices.  Your economy has next to zero impact on what OPEC chooses to set the price of oil at.

6708 2018-07-12 11:56:14 @Paula_White your a scam, a stain on humanity, a false prophet. Jesus was a rebel, broke laws and was a convict. You are just a white privileged snake oil salesperson. Jesus would have kicked your ass had you lived in his times.

6736 2018-07-12 11:53:15 Fred, you do realise there are significant differences between oil extraction in the calmer, shallower waters around Norway, than the deep, choppy seas around Scotland?
Not least, the huge difference in costs of extraction? 
6737 2018-07-12 11:53:10 Let’s not get carried away Donald with the whole Russia Germany thing & continually diverting attention away from your cosy relationship with Putin. What about the billions you pay the terrorist supporting Saudi’s for oil!

Also, i guess oil/gas plants and infrastructure dont take up any space?

God forbid we put solar panels in the desert, wouldnt want to cover up that sand!
6742 2018-07-12 11:51:54 Accord. to the Fed. Ministry of Economics, only 12.4 % of Germany's total oil consumption are fed by oil imports from Russia. Other imp. from Russia: natural gas: 8.8%, black coal: 3.7%, so 21.2% of Germany's energy mix come from Russian oil and gas, not 70%.
Check your "facts".

6749 2018-07-12 11:51:24 Still complain about Germany trading w/Russia for natural gas, but we get oil from Iran. Also, you refuse to impose the sanctions voted for by Congress against Russia for interfering with our election process.

6758 2018-07-12 11:50:12 So money  is taken from our paychecks to protect Germany from Russia, yet they pay Russia for oil?? Hello. I’m a generous a person, but I don’t want the US sending my money to people who don’t need it and don’t respect us.
6759 2018-07-12 11:50:09 So exactly why is the USA buying Oil from Russia and then complaining about Germany buying Gas?

6771 2018-07-12 11:48:50 The US is allowing a pipeline out of Canada, you know those folks you say that are cheating us in trade. Why did you push for that? Billions of gallons of oil, that are being sent to other countries.

6815 2018-07-12 11:44:30 There is no clear evidence that Russia is infiltrating the US by the hands of Trump. They’ve been infiltrating the US for forever. We get our oil from SA, who is an ally, not a nuclear threat. If you are against Iran, then you must LOVE his stance against them.

6820 2018-07-12 11:43:56 Absurd. Russia has turned off the natural gas spigot on Ukraine and other countries. Unlike oil supplies, natural gas pipelines cannot be re-routed. Of course, no problem unless Germany doesn’t want to freeze and wants to keep their factories running. They depend on Russia.
6821 2018-07-12 11:43:44 The EU imports of oil and coal have been higher than gas, but acceptable, since they were commodities, and you could replenish from the global market. 
Gas was in pipelines. Now gas can be replenished easily with LNG, from many  countries to terminals w spare capacity. Different!
6822 2018-07-12 11:43:25 @heysciencesam IIRC you’re a neurobiologist. Does Wild Salmon Oil (containing Omega 3) really help boost brain function?

6823 2018-07-12 11:43:19 And if there was a crisis, the money would also stop. So does Germany need the oil more than Russia needs the money? What good is having oil and gas if no one buys it?

6912 2018-07-12 11:33:14 Nice sales pitch. So basically you want the following from Europe and NATO:
1. Buy american oil and gas
2. Raise the budget spend on military equipment
3. Buy american military equipment

Did you sell vacuum cleaners in Brussels also?
6913 2018-07-12 11:32:53 Totally irelevant comment. If you think throwing a living breathing dog into hot boiling water or oil is OK then you need help. By the way, the story is about Iceland not Japan.
6914 2018-07-12 11:32:41 So why is Trump on twitter begging OPEC to increase oil production because US prices are too high???
6915 2018-07-12 11:32:40 TRUMP will meet Putin, 75% chance we will see sanctions dropped. Exxon $500 Billion oil deal with Russia can go through, Follow the money , enough to go around for all Fascists.

Like, bro, you're a plumber and telling her it just needs an oil change when you blew a head isn't helpful
6920 2018-07-12 11:32:11 Yet, he criticized Germany for buying oil/gas from Russia.  (Not sure what %, but I gathered it was significant).  So listening to Trump would HURT Russia and not make Germany as vulnerable to Russian whims with regard to energy.

6927 2018-07-12 11:31:21 You realize NATO was formed to go against Russia.
Now Germany wants to get their oil/natural gas from Russia without paying the full NATO fees.
You realize that Germany will be enabling and propping up the one country they are in an alliance to go against.

6933 2018-07-12 11:30:51 What he want to do is steal the oil industry from Europe for USA profit.
What he's actually doing, is making it more likely that Germany will create better relations with Russia, and worse relations with the USA, in an order to keep peace in Europe.
6934 2018-07-12 11:30:33 Tax on oil is easiest way but govt should reduce its dependence on it and find or generate other source of revenue. They merely do not know how to do that. And those like RR Rajan who know , they don’t fit in the egos of present govt.

6973 2018-07-12 11:26:16 So Germany buys most of their gas and oil from Russia, is a member of NATO, yet NATO calls for sanctions against Russia. 
6974 2018-07-12 11:26:16 It's so hot outside, you could fry an egg on a gas-range stovetop, using a skillet (nonstick) and light olive oil, salt, and pepper.
6975 2018-07-12 11:25:53 According to Germany's Federal Ministry of Economics, only 12.4 % of Germany's  total oil consumption are actually fed by oil imports from Russia.  Other imports from Russia: natural gas: 8.8 %, black coal: 3.7 %.

6979 2018-07-12 11:24:54 @AldiUK I noticed your Natural Selection flapjacks have palm oil as an ingredient, is this RSPO certified as its own brand or is it not guaranteed/known where it is sourced from?

6981 2018-07-12 11:24:52 NATO meeting went very well with members committing to pay their fair share. Pipeline from Russia to Germany is expensive, oil and gas $ will benefit Russia long term and that upset many.
6982 2018-07-12 11:24:30 It’s grossly hypocritical.  We have clear evidence of Russia infiltrating the United States.  We get our gas and oil from the Middle East.   Who’s to say some of that is not from Iran?  He’s a hypocrite.  Do as I say not as I do.

6989 2018-07-12 11:22:25 The fact that Germany buys oil from Russia tells me never to believe that politics matters forever. At some point, they will realise that pursuing politics at the expense of business isn't the way to go. No night lasts forever!

7084 2018-07-12 11:12:44 It is not impossible, it could be done. Not everybody has time ( whilst shopping ) to read every label on food ). If Supermarkets made their own brand ' palm oil free ' then consumers would have a choice. Something HAS to be done to save The Orangutans x
7085 2018-07-12 11:12:38 Saudi Arabia increased supplies by more than 500,000 barrels per day as reported , Iran & Venezuela crisis may subside as Libya crisis over as Rebels hand over the biggest Oil company to recognized govt. and #WTI around support level $70.00. WTI may fall to $65.00 in coming weeks
7086 2018-07-12 11:12:33 Currently we are using a blend oil in India to offer lower saturated fat than Palm oil. We are exploring options of using alternative oils with even lower saturated fat as sustainable solutions.
7087 2018-07-12 11:12:31 So they will get oil from Saudi Arabia and force prices up.

7095 2018-07-12 11:11:53 At least Russia is willing to give us Europeans gas and oil. And at least we are paying for it instead of invading countries to take it. Why not make us a deal? You give us a fair price that can compete with Russia, then we save money which can be spend on NATO, everybody's happy
7096 2018-07-12 11:11:24 I did no such complaining. Just because someone has access to oil doesnt mean we should excuse their behaviour

7108 2018-07-12 11:10:01 How much oil do you buy from Saudi? Also it's mainly natural gas that is bought from Russia. Want to build a gas pipeline from the US to Germany. Look at the map. Germany is trying to depend on reusable energy in the long run.

7116 2018-07-12 11:08:35 You lied to the world about Germany's reliance on Russian oil: it's a small amount. Moreover, Germany is a world leader on green energy, and could easily survive w/o the pipeline. Green energy: something you scoff at, Don, in favor of coal.
7117 2018-07-12 11:08:32 Believe me, Russia is the most peaceful country on earth because it got all it needs for a good life. Visit us, we need no additional grounds, no foreign water, oil, gas or forests. All we want is to protect us against nazis and Islamic extremism and enjoy NATO-free boundaries.

7126 2018-07-12 11:06:16 Is Trump trying to get Germany to buy oil from Saudi instead of Russia?
7127 2018-07-12 11:06:15 70% of Germany's energy comes from Russia. He totally schooled them and the media tries to cover it up. That's why Trump just tweets it out. Like the part about the former Chancellor being on the Oil company. What a scam the EU & NATO is.

7164 2018-07-12 11:01:27 LoL. US found a way to sell oil at higher rate (sooner or later) to India, while blocking (hurriedly obediently coplied by India) cheaper oil from Iran.
7165 2018-07-12 11:01:27 Gas prices are up 31% since last memorial day and can, in large part, be traced back to Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran deal and destabilize crude oil prices, a big gift to Russia and Saudi Arabia (but didn't help us in any way)

Come up with a solution to these issues rather than throwing a temper tantrum on the world stage.
7180 2018-07-12 10:59:28 But hey! Coconut oil at least has been pretty good treatment, plus it's always made my head smell delicious :))
7181 2018-07-12 10:59:24 He may have said gas not oil. Either way, it is still a lie.

7189 2018-07-12 10:58:19 Germany has the world's 4th largest economy and the largest economy in Europe. yet, we protect them from Russia. They then enrich Russia, spending billions for oil through the pipeline. In addition, they cheat on trade with us causing $150B deficit. Sound like a great ally?

7194 2018-07-12 10:57:37 OK how I feel about Trump is maybe not good but his remarks to NATO are right while USA is paying a fortune to 'protect' Europe supposedly against Russia, Germany & others are pouring Billions into the Russian economy via the oil/gas pipelines. WELL SAID DONALD.
7195 2018-07-12 10:57:31 No.  I bought dream cream from Lush the other day. I started with a cold and checked the ingredients to find it had lavender oil in it
7196 2018-07-12 10:57:30 How about microgest rectally?
Also, the peanut oil
Could that be implicationed in intestinal adverse reaction?

7198 2018-07-12 10:57:15 The issue with palm oil is that much of it has been developed in high biodiversity areas, more so then other oil crops, and moreover a substantial proportion has been developed uncontrolled.
7199 2018-07-12 10:57:07 Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be satisfied...truly bad people!
7200 2018-07-12 10:57:04 Well maybe the US should stop buying Canadian and middle east oil. Then you will very quickly realise why Germany is FORCED to buy from the Russians

7205 2018-07-12 10:56:18 I don’t dispute the technology. Just costs of renewables can’t compete get let KWH with existing infrastructure. But certainly in my life time the energy grid will organically shift. Unfortunately for Mother Earth coal and oil will still be needed and used in developing economies
7206 2018-07-12 10:56:13 THIS OIL PLATFORM IS MENTAL
7207 2018-07-12 10:55:57 Had to use google translate to explain to a trucker I needed to move oil from one facility to another one. Idk why the operation center thought it was a good idea to send a trucker who spoke zero English. I eat the hell out of some tacos, but that’s about it bud.

7218 2018-07-12 10:54:25 Why should you be trusted? You care only about spreading "democracy" (ie collecting oil and other precious resources from countries you keep unsafe for American interest)... you have no clue what democracy really means, or just don't care. I'm not sure which
7219 2018-07-12 10:54:22 I love how CBC uses a photo of the one platform not being downmanned. And calls them all oil platforms. We dont have oil offshore NS. We have natural gas.
7220 2018-07-12 10:54:06 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
7221 2018-07-12 10:54:00 The only problem with this story is that it’s far too relatable, even the cost of the house and terror-sized spiders. Similar alarm system. The previous owners were first-time parents. They go off shortly after putting olive oil in a warm pan and the Japanese game show begins.
7222 2018-07-12 10:53:59 Whats wrong? I am concerned? How about some bio coconut oil mixed with herbal oils and then gently rubbed in?

7225 2018-07-12 10:53:48 Nope that is not the number 1 cause of the destruction of the life support system of the planet, eating less meat does provide more food for others and less strain on resources, but engines that rely on the oil industry are the number 1 cause.

7227 2018-07-12 10:53:32 Unfunny left wing “comedian” #StephenColbert said last night he  “Wants His Agent To Toil For Him Like @realDonaldTrump Serves #Russia.”  @POTUS was urging Germany to ditch Russian pipeline & buy oil from USA.  This would financially cripple #Putin. #RussiaCollusion is old joke!
7228 2018-07-12 10:53:29 Germany needs the oil and gas that it buys. Would you prefer Germans freeze or be unable to fuel transport? Quit being rude
7229 2018-07-12 10:53:26 New pipeline? Merkels predecessor signed the deal. Merkel opposed it by the way. Germany wants to be less dependent from oil imports from muslim countries.

7235 2018-07-12 10:52:47 So chuck, trump calling out Germany for getting what 60% of their gas/oil needs from Russia, instead from a NATO member is trump being more loyal to Putin?Are you serious?You never respond back to people but  explain why this is supporting Putin!Germany could bought from us
7236 2018-07-12 10:52:41 And they wonder why law enforcement has more and more people looking at them with disdain. If a citizen did this, law enforcement would want the persons head.

7254 2018-07-12 10:49:49 According to Eurostats, the European Union's main statistics agency, Russia is the source of 25% to 50% of Germany's oil imports and 50% to 75% of its gas imports. Overall, roughly 40% of Europe's gas imports come from Russia, according to the agency.
7255 2018-07-12 10:49:45 Well, Henry Hub natgas has never been very correlated to crude oil in the states.  If anything its negatively correlated as more shale drilling for oil leads to more associated gas which puts pressure on natgas prices...

7277 2018-07-12 10:45:40 From Omolade Adunbi's chapter on the #NigerDelta rebellions in my forthcoming @OxUniPress Handbook of Nigerian Politics: there were 1,581 oil spills 1970-1982. Then 1982-1992, 1.6 million gallons were spilled from Shell
operations. 40% Shell's spills worldwide were in Nigeria.
7278 2018-07-12 10:45:30 Actually, Peanut Butter is the complete opposite of what you surmise. True it has fats, but it's hearth healthy unsat fats & peanut oil lowers cholesterol in moderate amounts. It's excellent source of protein and many essential vitamins and minerals. 

Moderation is key though!
7279 2018-07-12 10:45:23 When I try to follow the stupid logic of Trump. —> If Germany is controlled by Russia because it buys oil there, then the USA is totally controlled by SaudiArabia because its buying oil there.

7287 2018-07-12 10:43:45 Remember in early 2000s that the new gas pipeline to western Europe from Russia keeps Europe residents warm in the winter with Russia gas.  Very strategic issue if Russia closes or limits gas in winter months as it is like OPEC does on oil market.  It is a future play by Russia!

7302 2018-07-12 10:42:45 From @UschivdLeyen on down, there are complaints about defense investments not yet lined up, why throw money; wait & spend smart.  Trump just now saying small, poor countries can just buy US weaponry, it's the best.  Is that the whole point of 2% or 4%? Buy US?  US oil too?
7303 2018-07-12 10:42:41 Our NATO regimes create mass slaughter & horrors in lands of oil & any country which refuses to obey. You support this in full by refusing to challenge UK or NATO governments.
7304 2018-07-12 10:42:20 How Ironic! East Germany was cut off from importing oil from Soviet Union and was forced to mine coal which not only led to total pollusion of their cities but also West Germany. And now Trump wants to sell his coal back to Germany. I don't think so!

7307 2018-07-12 10:42:04 And why would he pressure Germany to stop buying Russian oil? it’s almost as if he’s not a Russian puppet...no it can’t be!
7308 2018-07-12 10:41:45 #Trump is still selling his crumby steaks and his fake university to idiots. Only this time it's American made arms to NATO countries under threats of US withdrawal. It's the oldest sell in the book that many a snake oil salesman is familiar with :-(

America buys oil from the Saudis, who attacked us on 9/11.

7320 2018-07-12 10:40:04 So it's a medium additive? I use spike lavender oil as a solvent in drop quantities in my media, which works well to improve flow on a microscopic level.

7323 2018-07-12 10:39:31 Ronin US gets more oil from Canada than anywhere else. Europe gets only 1/3 of its entire bat gas/ Petro from Russia. Why? Because it is cheaper than buying from US.
7324 2018-07-12 10:39:24 @mrjamesob If he's getting so worked-up about reliance on Russian oil - what about reliance on the Soyuz rocket in getting NASA astronauts up to the space station?
7325 2018-07-12 10:39:24 #BrettKavanaughScandals   had the oil changed at Oil Express in 2012, and it was discovered his left rear tire had 2 lbs less then recommended tire pressure.

7334 2018-07-12 10:38:08 Trick is getting all NATO nations to pony up. Germany is the big offender. As the wealthiest Euro nation (they’ve actually *reduced* their own army!) they need to pay 4% or more...and stop buying oil from the very nation they want to be protection from: Russia! Makes no sense
7335 2018-07-12 10:38:06 The glue and the oil

7342 2018-07-12 10:36:35 We would be, too, if Russia was our next door neighbor and we didn't have a large supply of domestic oil sources.

You work so hard to make people ignore the shocking ignorance of this president. Politicians are clearly a different species of human.
7343 2018-07-12 10:36:34 Thankful for: 2. Over-easy eggs and chilli oil  (sooo delicious)
7344 2018-07-12 10:36:22 I had similar pain, especially towards the end. You'd think I'd be doing squats all day the way the muscles were so tight. My pain was caused by the oil so a smaller needle probably wouldn't have helped me. But hopefully you've found a solution for you. Let of know if it works!
7345 2018-07-12 10:36:20 I'm the kind of person who would build a mining computer in a mineral oil setup just so I could say "check out my oil mining rig!"and promptly lose all possible resale value on my soul
7346 2018-07-12 10:36:11 Your rejection of climate science isn't a surprise.
It is quite common  that people who reject climate science are also afraid of new technology. #Coal is headed the way of Whale Oil Lamps.

7351 2018-07-12 10:34:24 So would you say the head of the EPA should have close ties to the oil industry or the coal industry? Do you think he should be able to print out emails from lobbyists and pass them on as if that would be the stand of the government towards that issue?
7352 2018-07-12 10:34:15 I can't understand why the American consumers can't find and trust good olive oil, yes the bad guys are winning you just have to look for it in Spain and you'll find quantity and quality, go directly to the small producers

7361 2018-07-12 10:33:15 A few more additions and it could be a very good season mate. Really difficult to compete with all the oil money Man Shitty are flinging about as usual though.
7362 2018-07-12 10:33:15 some people would rather pay for an oil change than do it themselves, pretty funny
7363 2018-07-12 10:33:05 Think #transformer exploding due to surge, overload, low power factor, harmonics, voltage phase imbalances, current phase imbalances, lack of oil changes (none), lightning, geomagnetically induced current GIC, or geomagnetic disturbances GMD, old age, etc.

7371 2018-07-12 10:31:34 It's good to control the anger.

7372 2018-07-12 10:31:29 And Canadian oil exports to the US means we are controlled by Canada? Qatari LNG exports to India means India is controlled by Qatar? That sort of illogic is right out of Ionesco.

7393 2018-07-12 10:28:58 Surely though we gotta make it better? How can you discover oil yet not feed you’re kids? Time politicians of all parties took a real hard look at what they are doing?
7394 2018-07-12 10:28:48 Maybe Gas and Energy is cheaper from Russia.  And why is it a bad thing if they buy from them?

If it ever comes to WWIII, the US had better hope their oil reserves outlast their opposition's.
7395 2018-07-12 10:28:37 I guess how you missed it's Germany giving Russia billions for oil and it was OUR PRESIDENT that called them out on it.

7399 2018-07-12 10:28:06 Trade is business. Has nothing to with NATO agreements except that working together on world peace is good for trade. The bigger the importance of trade for a country the higher the spending on NATO.  Much of US defense money is for trade, protecting the import oil routes.
7400 2018-07-12 10:28:03 It is impossible to accurately predict oil prices a year out as previous EIA predictions have shown over and over.
7401 2018-07-12 10:28:00 Oil prices suffered steep falls after Libya said it would boost supply.

If you like these types of posts comment down below 
7411 2018-07-12 10:26:55 You've really got to start listening to unbiased news. Trump isn't a politician, doesn't speak snake oil. It shakes people who aren't accustomed to it. Everyone's used to career liars. But Trump delivers what he promises. People like that are rare in politics
7412 2018-07-12 10:26:50 It's true.
7413 2018-07-12 10:26:46 Well this is embarrassing. It seems US imported 10.1million barells of oil in 2017 and exported just 6m barrels. 

Making it a net IMPORTER of oil.
7414 2018-07-12 10:26:33 So in a sense, as Brent-WTI fluctuates, Brent-Midland vertualky stays the same and elevated.  
Here is the point:
Brent is related to oil fields
Midland is related to oil fields
WTI is related to storage facilities!  @ErikSTownsend
7415 2018-07-12 10:26:29 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

7419 2018-07-12 10:25:55 I wonder how much of this is a real decline and how of this is stolen oil not reported.
7420 2018-07-12 10:25:41 @REUTERS — #OIL RECOVERS: Benchmark #Brent #crude oil rose $1.66, or more than 2.2 percent, to a high of $75.06 a barrel before easing back to trade around $74.80 by 0815 GMT. Yesterday, Brent had slumped $5.46 or 6.9%

7441 2018-07-12 10:23:09 My favourite form of scolding is protest scolding (e.g. White Rose scolding Greenpeace for not protesting Saudi oil). Must have missed @montie 's time and date details for his last Putin protest.

7458 2018-07-12 10:21:05 Well if Germany have a sweetheart Russian oil and gas deal, does,nt that essentially fund the Russian military dummies ?
7459 2018-07-12 10:20:54 His assessment of the facts is what’s incorrect. Countries trade with non-allies all the time. Trump literally wants the SAME kind of energy deal that Germany has with Russia, with RUSSIAN oil company Rosneft. How is that not so unbelievably ironic????
7460 2018-07-12 10:20:53 Hey CNN..you push that idea aswell every segment i watched..goes arround the 2% ..you try to justify the the total idiotic behave of your president..what about you tell the people about the 9 trillion USD oil deal YOU made with russia thx to exxonmobil and tillerson?
7461 2018-07-12 10:20:50 I think the real warmed-up visc.of that Fuchs product is
more like a "45", as it tends 
to have a slight reserve for 
harder conditions.

Valvoline SynPower is also 
similar in this regard (nominally a 5w40, yet the oil film is somewhat sturdier 
phyisically in the bearings).
7462 2018-07-12 10:20:41 well i just got a fight with boiling cooking oil..
7463 2018-07-12 10:20:38 @DanProft The Saudi's should appreciate Trump bringing up the Russian pipeline, they want in on the EU market too. I wonder if they will thank him by stepping up oil production to help lower our gas prices?
7464 2018-07-12 10:20:13 Germany shut down both coal and nuclear plants. They are switching to solar and wind on a massive scale. Their dependence on foreign oil is decreasing on a daily basis.
Meanwhile you are begging Saudia Arabia to lower oil prices.

STOP GASLIGHTING!
7465 2018-07-12 10:20:12 Figures provided by whom?? Oh that’s right, HM treasury, which still includes more in defence spend than we get back, a share of national debt we didn’t create, share in trident we don’t want, and minus the billions of unknown location oil tax revenues not attributed to us

7505 2018-07-12 10:14:31 Mixed week for #oil prices. Norwegian oil workers went on strike Tuesday, after rejecting a proposed wage deal, causing oil prices to rise. Wednesday, oil prices fell as Trump prepared to levy new tariffs on China, deepening a trade dispute that could depress energy demand.
7506 2018-07-12 10:14:20 I echo what other people have suggested - #Estonia, #Norway. Both tiny but doing big things. Sure, Norway has oil, but Estonia has been at the forefront of e-government & building up since its independence through innovation w/ little more than intellectual capital and drive

7508 2018-07-12 10:13:31 The fact that this is a lie is the problem. Germany gets 9 % of their energy from Russia. The US imported 12 million barrels of oil from Russia in January alone. It's Trump projecting and it's bullshit.

7522 2018-07-12 10:10:35 The only reason the USA spends so much on military, compared to the rest, is because America's CONSTANTLY sticking its dick in other people's business, usually for some ulterior motive (like oil).

7591 2018-07-12 09:58:23 The USA still gets oil from Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of the 911 terrorist Osama Bin Laden!  So what say you to that?
7592 2018-07-12 09:58:13 It's a mayo substitute, it's made it's name for being cheaper than mayo but thats because its not real food and is really just soybean oil with chemicals. It's positively disgusting. (I dont really like mayo either but at least it doesnt make me gag)
7593 2018-07-12 09:57:52 Yeah he didn't start a new war yet unlike the previous presidents. What reputation ? Your reputation is war ,lies and oil nothing more. Only Americans believe killing millions of people around the world is good reputation. Jesus Christ people

7602 2018-07-12 09:56:19 As usual, Trump plays fast and loose with the fact. The US pays roughly 22% of the common NATO operating budget. The 70-90 percent figure is based on aggregate defense spending, not the NATO budget. Don't believe everything you hear at a Trump rally

1stly, Fuel prices are driven by the Oil prices (Which are currently high at the moment $73/Barrel)
2ndly Govt taxes determine fuel prices, Not trying to single out one person for such crazy things.

7666 2018-07-12 09:44:54 I upset myself with my own opinions, one of which was that Piston engines were a total waste of time for Germany and that they should have scrapped the entire airforce and got the 262. All the fuel quality issues solved in one move, an elite airforce running on chip-frying-oil :)

Okay so I start off by making a hair mask with 1tbsp of each of these ingredients:

olive oil
Shea butter
Sometimes I also add an egg, then I put the mask on my hair, cover it in plastic wrap and put a hair towel for added heat

7674 2018-07-12 09:43:08 Shit, yeah. I forgot that if you didn't take money for our oil, exports and push our sea borders to claim fishing spots and oil sprouts that we'd get madly rich and spiral into a Brexit-free socialist utopia. We wouldn't want to fail like that now, would we?
7675 2018-07-12 09:42:55 None if this is true.
7676 2018-07-12 09:42:53 Question... Do you also want Poland and the Baltic countries to not buy gas from Russia? And if so, how do you plan to make sure that their energy requirement is meet?

That the central and eastern European countries have gotten gas and oil from Russia is hardly news...
7677 2018-07-12 09:42:29 There’s a great article somewhere on the history of lard. It was the oil of choice until electricity destroyed the candle industry. Desperate, they pivoted to the food market ‘vegetable dripping’ ‘pure, white’. 
Now we’re realizing many veg oils aren’t very good.
7678 2018-07-12 09:42:23 Nah, Trump outed himself as trying to use NATO relations to sell American oil, preferably oil provided by his own companies.

Does Trump have finances from Russia? Sure, which real state developer in any world city doesn't? That is true also for money from oil sheikhs. Ur point?
7697 2018-07-12 09:37:39 Yes, you have always been keen on protecting the producers than the consumers...why use outdated means of monthly reviewing of pricing?

7717 2018-07-12 09:34:19 Midnight Oil’s 1987 hit Beds are Burning is read these days as a #climatechange awareness song. Interesting that lyrics give 45 deg C as an example of extreme heat. Which it is of course, but has become all too common in past few years.

7729 2018-07-12 09:32:50 Donald Trump has beaten the EU and made a very good point. The EU countries want the US to protect them from Russia but they simultaneously finance Russia by making so many deals on trade (gas,oil and so on)

7732 2018-07-12 09:32:46 His asinine speech was a hissy fit over something that was a good thing for our country. US taxpayers
are shelling out money to Germany to protect them from Russia while Germany is giving Russia billions for oil!
Stupid is as stupid does! Trump is NOT the stupid one here.
7733 2018-07-12 09:32:44 and he was MC-ed around the UK selling his snake oil of why he is a hindu, by sri @saliltripathi ji. I wish there is a recording of this somewhere would be fun
7734 2018-07-12 09:32:17 It looks like an oil slick.
7735 2018-07-12 09:32:02 Our overdependence on oil has lead to loss of value of Human resources..  That is our number one problem in Nigeria, the reason why Fulani kills farmer too is because of value he placed in cow, to him, that is equal to the southern oil. .. And so killing continues

7740 2018-07-12 09:30:57 Much of Europe imports from Russia. Why? 

* Russia has largest natural gas reserves, is largest exporter
* Russia has second largest coal reserves (you dig coal, right?) 
* Russia largest exporter of oil in the world
* Russia's nextdoor

Funny they didn't tell you that.

7762 2018-07-12 09:27:51 Amazing, Trump tells Germany how can they have a oil deal with Russia 4 billions when the US is paying to protect them from Russia. Answer: The same way he can say Putin did not meddle in US elections and he gets along well with Putin. Sounds like a bit of jealousy 2 me.

7772 2018-07-12 09:26:13 No.. silly ladies.. Trump just wants Germany to buy it's oil from USA... Trump thinks Putin is great.. wants him back in G7.. talks to him regularly.. so what's the problem? By the way check your facts.. oh and did you get paid to tweet this.. you are sellouts.

7779 2018-07-12 09:25:11 A bean is definitely more hard to break through than an olive plus the taste is so much different. I can say that idk how rick could dislike the flavor of an olive because it’s oil is used to cook nearly everything. Or is it the texture? Cause you love beans if they’re so similar

7782 2018-07-12 09:24:25 @NancyPelosi @SenFeinstein @SenSchumer President Trump called out Germany for taking OUR money to defend themselves against Russia, then spend that money on Russian oil/gas. TRUMP called Merkel out on that BS and you still call him Putin's puppet. You can't have it both ways!!
7783 2018-07-12 09:24:22 One of my wigs cost me quite a lot but it’s so good that I can treat it myself with just shampoo, conditioner and argand oil. Been using it for almost a year now
7784 2018-07-12 09:24:18 Why do you continue to connect these two issues? Are you suggesting we don’t buy stuff from other countries? We purchase a significant portion of our oil from other countries. If you think they shouldn’t be doing business with Russia just say it’s bad to work with Russia - oops!
7785 2018-07-12 09:24:15 Wow So what.. Trump thinks Putin is a great man.. doesn't see him as an enemy.. wants him back in the G7.. oh but wait.. Germany isn't buying is oil from USA.. ohhhhhhhh.. wow idiots like you don't realise that Trump is in bed with Putin.. so Shhhh

7791 2018-07-12 09:23:18 70% of our energy don't come from Russia. Get your facts straight: In 2014, Germany imported about 35% of both gas and oil from Russia. But gas and oil are also only a part of the primary energy used in Germany besides coal and renewable energies.
7792 2018-07-12 09:23:13 u pkai ni after moisturizer?sbb i ada this oil tpi tk taw nk apply waktu bila 
7793 2018-07-12 09:23:06 Kalau oily skin, moisturizer yg tea tree oil tu best
7794 2018-07-12 09:23:03 That would be because Russia is so close and their gas and oil cheaper than buying & importing from M.East or the US. Russia are not our enemy (Europe), simply an adversary who tend to test boundaries. You are NOT the head of NATO so don't get to dictate to other member states!!
7795 2018-07-12 09:22:59 He wants Germany and other EU members to have an oil & gas deal with the US allies in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia and UAE as they do whatever Trump says. The US cannot expect to have the same dominance on Europe as they had in the Cold War era. That time is gone.

7807 2018-07-12 09:21:03 Trump is contradictory: castigates Germany for buying its oil through Russia, but is heading off to meet with Best Buddy Putin.  He uses contrariness as a toy and a tool. Wish the world leaders would collectively tell him to get off the pot.

E.g. if the wrong mechanic were to put oil based fluid onto a battery inadvertently. 

That is a fire hazard.

7982 2018-07-12 08:47:50 Yea coconut oil works really well actually! It just leaves my skin really oily for a few hours so I usually only use it when I’m about to go to sleep because then I wake up with really soft skin
7983 2018-07-12 08:47:49 Omar’s coming!!
7984 2018-07-12 08:47:27 Also, if tarrifs had any effect on the depression, it was to a large part driven by retaliatory measures by US trading partners. The context for Nigeria is different. Our only export worthy of mention is crude oil. It cannot be subject to retaliatory measures.

7986 2018-07-12 08:46:47 Aw! Have you tried coconut oil maybe?  Or a makeup removing balm
7987 2018-07-12 08:46:19 Spare oil capacity could be 'stretched to the limit' by OPEC's supply boost, IEA says - CNBC
7988 2018-07-12 08:46:14 I think so. Mine is fine on cooking oil with slight top up of diesel when it's cold. If they can test for red diesel, they can exempt us who use older diesel vehicles with cooking oil and do spot checks. Win Win as we don't use precious resources to build new vans @katejerrold
7989 2018-07-12 08:46:02 well....maybe she/he changed her sleeve.
use your imagination.
7990 2018-07-12 08:45:35 Just get 1 oil well is enough.
7991 2018-07-12 08:45:30 Absolutely love it!!!  The oil and eye cream are amazing. The balm is an essential so they are in reserve and I’m waiting to finish up a superfood before trying the PCMC in original. I bought 2 sets ooop 
7992 2018-07-12 08:45:24 It was not an accident. Why do u think oil is only sold from OPEC in US dollars? And we keep our dollar value strong with 20 billion dollars in debt?  It was never an accieen
7993 2018-07-12 08:45:18 Dear @POTUS, where does #Merkel think profits from #Oil sales go? #Russia history shows, it goes right 2 military at expense of people!

So, Merkel expects US #military 2 risk their lives to protect #Germany while they are fighting the Russia forces, she funded?! #MAGA #KAG #NATO

Go look at the late 70s early 80s oil crisis in US.. we swore to only but oil from them if they would control our prices and create the petrodollar to control our growing value in the dollar. In return we sell them weapon and military capabilities forever

8003 2018-07-12 08:43:11 Premier Oil’s board has approved its Tolmount gas project in the UK North Sea ahead of a final investment decision in the third quarter and the company also expects to start drilling on a first well in Mexico in the fourth quarter

8010 2018-07-12 08:40:32 yep - Oil 101 - @CommodityMD is a  book but I'm filing that under 'must have' rather than 'must read': essential for referencing but I would argue my original list gives you a more real world perspective on how/what and why commodity markets work for some (not for veryone).

8018 2018-07-12 08:38:05 You are the one who says everyone does it. Trump is at NATO claiming Germany is controlled by Russia because they get 60% of their oil there. Well Trump received the majority of his funding for golf courses from Russia and using his same logic he is indebted to them.

8020 2018-07-12 08:37:57 It’s about time, right?  Everyone said they had no clue how much oil the ol’ gal actually had in those reservoirs. Now lower the price at the pump and a barrel of oil for winter and we’re on our way to giving the bird to to the sheiks over there.

8021 2018-07-12 08:37:52 In the video people are carrying their tribs flags which have nothing to do with the unemployment and services crisis in Basra. I see protesters carrying banners demanding better life and they are only blocking the roads heading to the oil companies north of Basra.
8022 2018-07-12 08:37:37 I don't need to address their arguments in the same way as I don't need to log into the Mises Institute website every day to address the issues their economic arguments, or oil industry lobbyists arguments on climate change.
8023 2018-07-12 08:37:32 There is some interesting research on feeding turmeric (it has to be combined with black pepper and oil for some reason) it worked wonders on my old mare
8024 2018-07-12 08:37:21 just not true. once pipeline is up, germany is expecting a max import of 40% of oil/gas from russia. BUT: fossil energy is only 20% of our overall energy resource. so we look at total of ca.8% of our resource. THAT, we can compensate. but this maths is too complicated, right?

The US still gets oil from Osama Bin Laden's birthplace (his family) Saudi Arabia so....
8027 2018-07-12 08:37:01 Totally agree with Trump,no wonder the Germans have all the money they need when the USA pays billions in defence, they pay next to nothing, but can do a deal for oil and gas from RUSSIA worth billions,so much for sanctions.

8029 2018-07-12 08:36:32 Absolutely right, this man is the biggest threat to our world at the moment, he has a direct connection with climate change, who do you think his entire campaign was funded by, The Koch Brothers, billionaire oil barons.
8030 2018-07-12 08:36:10 You still believe that? Well, if it helps you sleep at night who am I to judge.

But just in case, volunteering in a war started on BS to help corporations get their hands on oil didn't "keep the country safe." Unless you mean keeping fat ass Americans safe from never driving.

8034 2018-07-12 08:35:24 I know this goes without saying but, still, for Trump to accuse Germany of undermining NATO by accepting oil and gas from Russia while his campaign is under Federal investigation for collusion with Russia is more than a little hypocritical. #glasshousesandstones

8048 2018-07-12 08:33:10 It's true, there was virtually no money from oil, the income has risen over last year but not to any significant level. actually less than the SNP deliberate underspend.

A few facts:
UK cannot poduce enough food for current population
Without oil maximum UK population is about 15m (oil runing out & we must stop using it anyway)

8104 2018-07-12 08:25:36 I think I know how he got to 70%. 30 % of oil imports are from Russia, 40% of Gas imports, he added the two to get 70%
No wonder he thinks the US spends 4% of GDP on NATO

 - Celebrity worship
8111 2018-07-12 08:22:23 You realize most all the states money is tied to oil, a dying industry that is going to go the way of Blockbuster soon enough.
8112 2018-07-12 08:22:23 i was almost stranded bc we run out of gas driving back from the beach today but you know what shout-out to bp for having a 24 hours station. you may have had that horrific oil spill a few years ago, but tonight you saved us
8113 2018-07-12 08:22:11 Lmao. They're always working in Shell oil.
8114 2018-07-12 08:22:09 I think you’re right. Oil, as good as it is health wise, doesn’t cut it taste wise for that type of use. Oil wasn’t around as much when I was a kid.
8115 2018-07-12 08:22:00 開封後の理想的な使用期間〜その１✿
油は空気に触れると酸化していきます。油性の化粧品が酸化や劣化した場合は香料などの香りが抜けて油臭が強くなるようです。ご参考として使用の理想は開封後半年〜１年くらいになります。半年で必ず酸化するのではないのでひとつの目安として下さい

8118 2018-07-12 08:21:09 So why does USA import 160 million barrows of oil a year from Russia? He who lives in a glass house should not throw stones.

8120 2018-07-12 08:20:56 I tend to refer to Norwegians as trolls, black metal trolls or some other variant. Codfish is sometimes linked.

8121 2018-07-12 08:20:47 Brexit papers today & yesterday crowing about the Government prepping for no-deal. So this involves food stockpiling, possible rationing, generator barges to power London and building reserves of Gas and Oil.

I mean come on, is this really the right move?
8122 2018-07-12 08:20:43 This part of protest is near West Qurna-2 oil field where protests started against unemployment & oil company importing entire set of staff & refusing to employ local workers. People in area wear traditional clothes (including عگال) unlike in Basra city, where youth are leading
8123 2018-07-12 08:20:40 Well then Donald are you going to build a pipeline from the U.S.  to Germany so that you can sell them oil? Since Germany has no oil of their own they either buy from Russia or buy the overpriced as you called it oil from OPEC nations.
8124 2018-07-12 08:20:29 See that's what's nice about this President, he's going after the drug companies and looking into tapping into our own oil supplies.
8125 2018-07-12 08:20:21 #LT I don't want to say it but there is some truth in what Trump says *gaging sounds*
Yes, we get a lot of our Oil (not "energy" Mr. Racist-Orange) from Russia and therefore have to be careful not to piss on Russia's leg too much, but we are not controlled.

8190 2018-07-12 08:07:46 The problem is also the gas/oil is cheap. They can't turn it off so easily without more protest throughout the bloc. Ukraine didn't work and Syria hasn't either Russia played the greater check and has entrenched more into those pipelines. Getting at both Iran and North Korea....
8191 2018-07-12 08:07:45 @Hamara_Desh Don't you think India cutting down on Crude oil imports from Iran which is rupee trade is bad for our country? Don't you think India being told not buy Defence Missile shield from Russia is bullying attitude by US?
8192 2018-07-12 08:07:36 The bottom line is that oil is not our only resource and is not vital to moving forward. A bonus? Yes. An essential? No. Suck it up trolls.

8256 2018-07-12 07:59:08 I guess it’s been running low since 2015  honestly, unless the oil prices jump up again, I think we’re going to sink more and more. I don’t see any way out of this anytime soon.
8257 2018-07-12 07:58:58 Maybe check your facts? How does Germany taking 9% of its oil from Russia equal to Getting “all their natural resources” from Russia? If you start off your argument in bad faith, we have nothing to discuss.

8323 2018-07-12 07:45:45 It would be very interesting to learn which African state this is. Russia / Azerbaijan for example would love to get their oil & gas pipelines down there as would China love to get their own paws on more of Africa.

8354 2018-07-12 07:37:55 Baby Trump is jealous that Merkel has a relationship with Putin so she can buy oil from him for Germany. Trump wants to be the first leader to have a close relationship with Putin so he can say he made the world safe from war. ...He wants to be seen as the saviour of the world.
8355 2018-07-12 07:37:55 Germany is getting their oil from Russia and Trump got his presidency from Russia.
8356 2018-07-12 07:37:51 Germany is not our ally. Germany has alway s supported Russia. Now Germany and Russia are able to extort Eastern Europe. Putin can cut of energy to Eastern Europe and Germany still will have theirs. Germany can now say to Eastern Europe want oil? You have to do what we say.

8362 2018-07-12 07:35:51 Well well, but We differ. we think production method is key. Seen some good response to that. A raw coconut oil should ideally go through another process before been sold. Something rarely done.
8363 2018-07-12 07:35:30 if they dont pay back out also germany should be buying oil from us

Then NO ONE would need Russian oil and gas.
Not even the Russian people.

8517 2018-07-12 07:04:51 some of my personal fave intrusive thoughts include pushing people from bridges or into the road, slipping in the shower and dying (and the aftermath of people finding me naked, the shame), people poisoning me, putting my hand onto or into a pan of boiling water/soup/oil 
8518 2018-07-12 07:04:45 Buy original coconut oil, made with the freshest coconut oil using the best method of production. Coconut oil is good for your skin, good for your hair. Just buy 100percent pure virgin coconut oil.

8543 2018-07-12 06:59:56 Germany/NATO fights with USA in all these wars they started for getting the countries oil. Lybia, Irak, Afghanistan... Destroying the countries, sending refugees to Europe. Stop crying USA.
8544 2018-07-12 06:59:36 Life has always been hard for most people until the age of oil.  When oil runs out it's 50/50 we're back to pre-19th century life, unless we perfect renewable energy.

8546 2018-07-12 06:59:22 70 years defending Europe with US blood and treasure and Germany cuts s deal to buy $400 Billion worth of Russian oil? Why should we continue to spend $60 Billion a year on NATO to defend Germany?

8548 2018-07-12 06:59:08 Let the free market make the move away from plastic and oil. In the meantime, your legislation just hurts businesses, raises consumer prices, and imposes taxes on hard working Canadians. Your carbon footprint is probably 50x that of the average Canadian. Your virtue is hollow.
8549 2018-07-12 06:59:04 An entire Economics thesis can be written from this. It goes further:
*owns crude oil, imports petrol and diesel. 
*lots of arable land, imports most food crops.
*exports qualified doctors, then travel abroad for healthcare. 
Many more... 
Nigeria is a paradox.
8550 2018-07-12 06:58:38 Looking to increase? Bush asked nicely, Obama asked nicely. 1.2% GDP from Germany, the #1 GDP in Europe, 14 times less then America pays, when their GDP is just 5.5 times less. They signed a $11 billion oil deal with Russia from their savings, 1 day after they expelled diplomats.
8551 2018-07-12 06:58:07 Lol. I worked in a Quality control lab at an industry that cooking oil and margarine were some of their products and testing the M.P of the product to calculate shelf life was literally done using warm water.

8648 2018-07-12 06:41:05 Akere there has got to be an encouragement on the oil producing countries to make more if I'm not mistaken
8649 2018-07-12 06:40:56 Oh germany should buy more oil from your Saudi friends so you and you cronies make more money 
8650 2018-07-12 06:40:35 Brent crude and WTI oil prices dropped sharply to close yesterday’s trading session at US$73/bbl and US$70/bbl due to increased output and trade-war fears.
8651 2018-07-12 06:40:34 shiny everything is covered in oil/ plastic wrap coloring is upsetting to me.
8652 2018-07-12 06:40:22 And oil is a global commodity w a global market. Germany could get its oil from anywhere, because the US guarantees the world's supply w military force. Venezuela would be happy to sell oil to Germany but we won't allow it.

8678 2018-07-12 06:36:48 The world economy is dependent on oil that is not available domestically to most. We knew this after WW2 and established an empire in the Middle East on behalf of our oil interests. We overthrew democratic governments to make sure our access wasn't threatened.

8689 2018-07-12 06:35:29 The solution is to reject the unwritten rule against disbanding large corporations. Put a few oil companies out of business by democratic decree. Then the existential threat would cause the remaining corporations to avoid the scrutiny that exploitation brings.

8692 2018-07-12 06:35:18 Oil is a global commodity. For many years we imported oil from would-be adversaries, like the Saudis, but we maintained trade with them in exchange for foreign policy concessions. We had to. What are countries not as rich in resources supposed to do?

8707 2018-07-12 06:34:05 NATO countries need to dump Russian energy deals.  The US has a major surplus of natural gas and rising oil production.

America's GDP is just 5.5 times more. Why exactly is Germany just paying 1.2% & why they are they spending big $ on Russian oil?

@NatashaBertrand @Shareblue
8759 2018-07-12 06:27:10 Fair enough. However, Russia currently supplies 40% of all German oil and that number will increase with the formation of the pipeline. The US gets almost no oil from Afghanistan, and gets less than 10% if it’s oil from Iraq, and those numbers have been declining, not increasing

8784 2018-07-12 06:23:05 You could have a bunch of sexy looking butts in your gasoline commercial.  People will be going crazy trying to get the gasoline products.  It could even sell Chili, Pork and Beans, Gasoline, or even Gay products such as "Olive Oil".  Start your farting campaign.  People love it!
8785 2018-07-12 06:23:05 Finally watched the whale rescue movie they filmed several years ago in my hometown. It was cute and fine and boy it was really stupid how a bunch of stuffy state politicians canceled our film tax credit program because they wanted to give more money to oil companies.
8786 2018-07-12 06:22:52 They took a gigantic dump on garard. Massive. They threw him under the bus so hard he changed the oil for the effort
8787 2018-07-12 06:22:44 I like Mbappé and he definitely has potential, but he will never reach it fully playing in Ligue 1.

8789 2018-07-12 06:21:46 Exactly the point... I never claimed there's no Chinese or foreign banks in India b4.
Read the tweets again for sarcasm.

Has India threatened Oil Exporting Countries?

RBI site has a complete list of foreign banks n this ain't a first state owned Chinese bank operating in India.

8791 2018-07-12 06:21:18 They didn't JUST start buying oil from Russia. Quit the lies. Quit the propaganda. And you're never going to convince them to commit 4% of their GDP to defense spending. Just because we overspend on our military doesn't mean everyone should or can.

8796 2018-07-12 06:20:31 Thats not new, Europe gets gas & oil from russia since decades. Even at the high points of the cold war the oil & gas were dilivered. The new pipeline, just bypasses the old one. Your only point is that you want to sell more expensive u.s. gas to europe.

8819 2018-07-12 06:17:02 The USA buys natural gas and oil from Russia. In fact, in the first 4 months of 2018 alone the USA bought over 38,500 barrels of oil from Russia. So maybe Trump needs to stop buying from Russia before he criticises others. (sources below)

8841 2018-07-12 06:14:21 @MSNBC Nearly half the natural gas flowing through pipelines into Germany last year came from Russia. Like the rest of the European Union, Germany relies on Russian exports as its main supply of gas and crude oil. It’s about 40 percent for crude oil, and about 30 percent for coal

8843 2018-07-12 06:13:47 So they can't buy oil from whoever they want?  It's called free market.
8844 2018-07-12 06:13:42 I don't see what buying oil or gas has to do with paying for NATO. Has your brain turned to mush?

8855 2018-07-12 06:12:21 Many in NATO r lowkey regarding defense spending. Others camouflage their globalist intertwining nature. Still, others r indifferent to paying their fair share. Meanwhile, Germany's '1.2% of GDP' invested 4 defense is unconscionable while openly purchasing gas & oil from Putin.

8863 2018-07-12 06:11:17 So according to you the German people should go without natural gas and freeze to death .. That has nothing to do with nato ffs ..  maybe the US should stop buying oil from Canada until the US pays China the 2 trillion they owe in debt.. your argument makes no sense !!

8903 2018-07-12 06:04:55 Indeed, the main difference between President GWB & Trump is that GWB, as evil as his tactics were, was trying to do what he thought was best for the U.S.'s future. Part of it had to do w/ the fact that he & his administration & party were obsessed w/ the oil in the Iraqi region.

8913 2018-07-12 06:03:48 @yeobeeyin New govt MUST take opportunity to investigate TNB monopoly & costs/oveheads/productivity, bring tariffs in line with acceptable ROI instead of automatically passing gas/oil price rises to consumers with no reduction when gas/oil prices go down!

8942 2018-07-12 05:58:54 I went to one of our local natural food distributors today and checked the labels - one of the ones I've tried in the past apparently was primarily of tapioca starch and coconut oil. It was my least favorite of the ones I've tried.

8945 2018-07-12 05:58:16 What false claim about Germany?
We pay 70% of Nato expense.If you work for a living, that has come out of your paycheck. 
We have 21 US Military Bases in Germany, to protect Germany from Russia. They buy 40% of oil from Russia. Will be 60-70% with pipeline 2019. We've been duped!
8946 2018-07-12 05:58:10 I like that my peppermint oil makes me cry.

8948 2018-07-12 05:57:55 Every president before him conspired with oligarchs to get elected. Why is putin worse than the big pharma/oil/weapons manufacturers executives who have always controlled policy? Are their business interests anymore pro American than the kremlins?
8949 2018-07-12 05:57:49 Wow! Trump recruited by Sovs 2 years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, figuring he'd be Prez in 29 years and would benefit USSR. It worked! Trump is drilling oil, getting OPEC to pump more, beefing up US military and forcing NATO to do same. That'll show that upstart Putin!
8950 2018-07-12 05:57:39 Ok trump. Sell Germany your oil and gas. Problem solved

8956 2018-07-12 05:56:44 How Trump's disdain for NATO ..
There is NO DISDAIN for NATO.Germany will be a captive of Russia if in the future troubles arise, the Russians could cut off the oil unless Germany complies. They did it to Ukraine!
8957 2018-07-12 05:56:29 And Germany TODAY is getting 70% of their oil from Da Da Da DA!  RUSSIA!

8962 2018-07-12 05:55:25 President @realDonaldTrump is putting NATO on notice that America is not the worlds piggy bank anymore. He wants all NATO nations to pay their fair share. And for Germany to stop financing Russia by buying their gas and oil.
8963 2018-07-12 05:55:22 Like Germany truly “needs” cheep gas, really??.. They don’t, since they’ve got the strongest economy in Europe. They certainly don’t mind getting things “for free”. Why not?!We protect them “for free”, why not get some of that Soviet ‘s gas & oil?
8964 2018-07-12 05:54:56 Today at work I splashed oil on my face by accident and stood there hysterically crying as my coworkers tried to help and then I just started laughing really hard....if that doesn't summarize how life is going for me idk what does.

9046 2018-07-12 05:41:46 Meanwhile dRUmph goes to NATO & claims Germany is controlled by RUssia b/c they rely so heavily on their oil, a puppet to RUssia.

By that logic, the U.S. is controlled by China, we are heavily indebted to China.

But no.The truth is dRUmph IS controlled by RU, a puppet to Putin.
9047 2018-07-12 05:41:40 Get the fillet, squeeze a lemon, pinch of salt, pinch of rosemary, olive oil& some thyme and sage as well as some parsley / add some peppercorns for some texture too
9048 2018-07-12 05:41:27 Are all Democrats fools??? Today Trump chastized Germany for paying Russia billions every year for natural gas at the same time the USA is covering 74% of NATO's protection of Europe FROM Russia--& former German Chancellor Schroeder works for the Russian oil company???
9049 2018-07-12 05:41:24 Then, why buy all that lovely oil from Russia?  Since, NATO was designed to protect Germany from Russia.

Oh, the irony.  Truth hurts

9065 2018-07-12 05:39:27 My fav coworker started using cinnamon, almond and lotus oil in her dreads and I can't help but think that this must be what Sekhmet smells like.
9066 2018-07-12 05:39:13 In a world awash with better quality oil than bitumen, it's not a surprise that there's little interest in more bitumen mega-projects.
9067 2018-07-12 05:39:11 And take a look at Maroon, Hall, Barzal & Ebs. The Oil would of been off the chart. Literally.

9070 2018-07-12 05:38:39 We stood by you in your deceitfull "war om terror". Our soldiers died in iraq for your oil interests, in afghanistan hunting down al-qaida. And this jackass is breaking all aliances down and puting europe in putins firingline... and joe public in america seems to love it. WTF?
9071 2018-07-12 05:38:34 Read yesterday that demand is down due to higher oil prices.
9072 2018-07-12 05:38:32 Hands up who is from the oil and gas industry
9073 2018-07-12 05:38:26 I am in no way defending anything this cretin says or does, ever, but that figure is for their overall energy consumption, correct? Oil accounts for about 1/3 of German consumption and, of that, 40% of their supply is imported from Russia. Doesn't exactly make them "captive," but
9074 2018-07-12 05:38:11 Uh uh sis you need some holy oil I got you 
9075 2018-07-12 05:38:09 Y’all females know how to change oil? A tire? Something
9076 2018-07-12 05:38:05 Because straws are given away for "free" (not really, but you know)... just as plastic bags were. They're an oil derivative. Basically, liberals want to rid use for environmental purposes and the "conservatives" don't want to give anything for "free" when they can charge them.
9077 2018-07-12 05:37:47 TBF, the first Gulf War, while still about protecting oil interests, was started by Saddam invading Kuwait. Had Bush senior not worried about pics of us annihilating Iraqis on the "Highway of Death" we could have ended it permanently.

Half ass job lead to more American deaths.
9078 2018-07-12 05:37:32 Crude's already starting to crawl back out of the crater. Headwinds to economic and oil demand growth from the trade wars are real, but at this point hard to quantify or position in terms of timing. The supply shortages are a clear and present danger. #crude #oil #OOTT
9079 2018-07-12 05:37:28 You are WRONG ma'am. Or either you've forgotten how economics work. "Supply and demand". As usual at this time of year when Americans travel. The price of crude oil always rises. Can't remember a summer it hasn't. So YOU are NOT the only one wanting to get the "CRUMBS" God bless.

9085 2018-07-12 05:36:39 Most Americans will be effected by climate change, which Trump still denies and claims it’s a Chinese hoax. The former EPA chief was an oil man and now the new EPA chief is a coal man. They clearly don’t have environmental interests in mind. 

I could go on but there is too much.

9088 2018-07-12 05:36:15 So Trump colluded with Putin and the Russians and then try’s to get Germany to NOT buy oil or gas from Russia?  That’s some wired way to collude.
9089 2018-07-12 05:36:09 This world,  esp this governaning powers,  are just telling lie when they tell u to save this n that and to recycle.  Oil industry is a fucking big monopoly here,  #ElonMusk please march on!  Let's.

9109 2018-07-12 05:31:50 Sad. Mainstream Media coverage very biased.
Germany has massive oil & gas deal with Russia,
But, the US protects Germany, France, and other countries. 
POTUS objective: NATO allies--pay their fair share.
US paying 4.2%, Germany 1%
What is appropriate or fair?

9123 2018-07-12 05:29:43 Absolutely Diane. And the conservatives, John A MacDonald financed a Railway, made the country, Peter Laugheed financed the “tar sands, to become the oil sands, Brian Mulroney financed Hiberbia, Harper bailed out GM, etc.
9124 2018-07-12 05:29:15 no, harder than that.

well.

softer, more precisely. particularly when sloshed.

you can deep fry cake, did you know?

probably don't though. oil saturation. it's. not good.

I didn't actually eat any of the mini battenburg cakes but the jam filling looked fairly scary.
9125 2018-07-12 05:28:44 And the cost to the environment, on a full life cycle basis, is considerably less than that for fossil fuels. Or is it really true? Is a build out of oil, gas and coal infrastructure to meet further demand made out of environmentally unicorn dust?
9126 2018-07-12 05:28:27 Corruption is endemic in our governments at all levels. Because it benefits the rich oil and land barons is no reason to endorse it.  You are supposed to govern for the people!
9127 2018-07-12 05:28:25 I salted the trout filets and sauteed them in olive oil on skin side; after a couple mins. add grapes & thyme and cook in oven at 350 for about 5-7 mins. I topped it with fresh pea sprouts!
9128 2018-07-12 05:28:05 #Harf has outdone herself with this line of punditry....this was not a signal, this was a warning shot to NATO to get their act together ....and why is Germany helping prop up Russia’s economy by buying their gas and oil ....

9131 2018-07-12 05:27:42 CBD oil is 100% legal in the US. It’s not dope. It’s industrial grade hemp and grown by farmers and approved for growth by the USDA.
9132 2018-07-12 05:27:29 Lightly sponged with tepid water in slow circles should lift it as long as the mayonnaise wasn’t oil heavy
9133 2018-07-12 05:27:16 @JamesCrisp6 Your article re Germany and gas is rather laughable.  UK gets 6% of its gas/oil from Russia now.  It will increase as other fields fall.  So point fingers if you wish but UK will be first to squeal when gas is turned off.
9134 2018-07-12 05:27:16 If he'd been accurate it wouldn't have sounded so good for his base. Germany do get 60% of their oil from Russia, but that's only 20% of their energy consumption, much of which is renewables.

9142 2018-07-12 05:26:14 Nicholas' memory doesn't quite jog back to Krimea. Ukraine had to beg for oil from Russia, because their country, similar to Germany was totally dependent on Russian energy. So after Russia took Krimea from Ukraine, Ukraine begged to get heat for their homes. What did Obama do?
9143 2018-07-12 05:26:11 And so many of them blame Trump, when we've had immigration laws for longer than they've been alive.
9144 2018-07-12 05:26:06 CBD oil is made from industrial hemp which is legal in the US. It has only trace amounts of THC. You feel no effects of that. It cured my insomnia. I use FAB CBD - great stuff.
9145 2018-07-12 05:25:45 Thats called world trade. Why does america pay billions of dollars to saudi arabia for oil? When many terroristic groups, like ISIS, is payd and funded by many rich oilsheiks?

9149 2018-07-12 05:25:26 USA is not spending what you asked for today! At least Germany is paying for the oil/gas.  What are you getting for fawning over Putin?  You are making a laughing stock of yourself.  Or are you compromised?
9150 2018-07-12 05:25:15 I have lavender essential oil in my diffuser, I just took a melatonin, and I’m laying on a heating pad. Insomnia and anxiety, I will beat you tonight.
9151 2018-07-12 05:25:11 Plastic bag ban is great, but how about we make oil companies that devastate marine life, pay to fix it? Or stop deforestation of jungle and rainforests? Or make billionaires that horde more than a quarter of the world’s wealth, actually contribute to protecting the planet?
9152 2018-07-12 05:24:36 If you don’t want Europe to be dependent on Russian oil and gas then build your own goddamn pipeline and sell them US oil/gas. People need these resources and will buy them from who they have to.
9153 2018-07-12 05:24:12 spilled coconut oil in my bed and I ain’t even mad 
9154 2018-07-12 05:24:12 Using one face oil i got somewhere as my body oil because it had me breakout and we're against wastage. Also, by breakout, I mean I had a pimple from using it hahaha
9155 2018-07-12 05:24:08 U.S. did much worse. We sold uranium to Russia. So, we.potentially sold them the very element to be used in producing
nuclear war heads to be used against us.  Atleast the Germans
got oil. Imagine if both events did not happen. Russia would be in a world of hurts.

9169 2018-07-12 05:21:54 It's a total red herring. It's Trump's crisis of the day to deflect from whatever it is he doesn't want his base to look at.  Before today, how many of you were really worried about Germany and where it gets its oil?  Not many, I'd bet.

9174 2018-07-12 05:21:38 Actually only 35% of our oil and gas imports are coming from Russia. Around 30% of our power comes from renewable sources. No thanks, we don‘t want to buy your coal...

9182 2018-07-12 05:20:36 Might want to ask Nicholas if he got some $ under the table from that oil pipeline Germany built to Russia by their former former chancellor. Bemoans Trump, when we spend 3.5% at $700 Billion on Nato when Germany only spends 1.2% at $51 billion & props up the Russian threat.

9190 2018-07-12 05:19:20 Trump was absolutely correct - Germany imports 70% of its Oil from Russia, so that makes Germany dependent on Russia. 
No Sorry - that's USA importing 70% of its oil from Canada - Trump has the right stats - just the wrong countries. Phew relief.
9191 2018-07-12 05:18:52 “Unfair”? What?

Alberta politics (no matter what party holds office) has a very minor impact on the world price for natural gas and oil.

#FactCheck: it’s sadder when the U.S. debt to China is $1.19 trillion as of March 2018. That’s 19% of the $6.29 trillion in Treasury bills, notes, and bonds held by foreign countries.

9214 2018-07-12 05:15:22 Let me see if I understand this, Trump goes to Europe and tells European Nations  they are fools for depending on Russia for oil & being at Russian mercy when they can buy it from us.

Somehow, to the Liberals this means that Trump is helping Putin. Liberals are hilarious

9228 2018-07-12 05:13:03 Scientists have created construction materials from peat - decaying organic matter - and oil shale ash, that could reduce costs of building a house nearly tenfold.
9229 2018-07-12 05:12:46 Where else can Europe get crude oil and gas??.. Remember Russia is capitalist now and must be allowed to capitalize..yes Europe will be dependent on Russia for their gas..the USA can't build a pipeline across the Atlantic Ocean to supply Europe..wish the USA could

9236 2018-07-12 05:12:17 Yes and that’s how they want to transport oil products rather than a pipeline - alrighty then 
9237 2018-07-12 05:12:10 He understands were being taken advantage of.  They (Germany)can’t pay for defense against the big, bad Russians...but they can buy Russia’s oil and gas?  Trump is calling them on that...yeah, the Russian “asset” is trying to take away Russia’s business!  Explain that Ted!
9238 2018-07-12 05:11:32 Shell consortium's Canada LNG is a go. No doubt. ExxonMobil/Imperials Oil's WCC LNG will also be a go few years down road. No doubt. Also, Kitimat LNG will also be a go. With latter two, likely early 2020's for FID. IMHO

9266 2018-07-12 05:06:56 That maybe so (though to me oil and gas are not the same thing at all, overproduction of the latter) but I don't know anyone who ever made real money with UNG, something with the way it's designed,  different product then USO. Maybe as a quick trade but nothing more.

9301 2018-07-12 05:02:05 Neither do I want this to change  into an oil money machine. But we do not have any long term policy. It's ok if you buy players on a budget and try to make them great. But when a great player leaves you have to replace them otherwise the rest leaves. Which is what happened.
9302 2018-07-12 05:01:38 Hey man so I got a question. So it seems you present a bud each episode but the chefs always cook with different ingredients. Is that the prize or does the show provide the oil/butter? or is it the chefs that prepare it before each episode? Thanks dude

Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.

9307 2018-07-12 05:00:59 Unless you think smog in a city is the worst outcome of air pollution and not climate change making all of earth uninhabitable, there is no difference.

As for oil dripping, i'm less worried about oil dripping on freeways than I am it being dumped into waterways.

9312 2018-07-12 05:00:24 The deal was nothing but a grocery heist writ large. Pallets of , our tax dollars, delivered in the middle of the night to a terror sponsor and participator. They were never going to honor that agreement. Anyone who doesn't fault them is looking to cash in on the Iran oil.

9315 2018-07-12 05:00:08 What is interesting about this chart is until 12 years ago Saudi didn't need any rigs to speak of. Almost no exploration success in 50 years the rigs are doing infill drilling on their 6 old fields that supply 85% of their oil. It's late in the game & there will be no tertiary.

9318 2018-07-12 04:59:45 Nolan - hope all is well... I’ll just say as a libertarian I jumped off the bandwagon with the Tariffs.. my significant other works for a Canadian oil and gas company in their US office. Their getting taxed on steel both ways... had to shut their plant down.. all employees out..
9319 2018-07-12 04:59:39 he's coming back to the Oil, the Oilers have a deal in place for Lucic as reported, but not until after the 1st half of the season to ensure the bounce back. Looch moves, Patty comes back...

9329 2018-07-12 04:58:20 Well I think the eggs and oil contribute to the mayo, and most pimento cheeses I've had contain mayo. I've lived in the south for four years and only found one really great pimento cheese that didn't taste super mayo-y.
9330 2018-07-12 04:58:16 Exactly. When oil prices began to fall in mid-2014 and showed no signs of improving, the only logical industry reaction was consolidation to drive down costs. Shell had a debt problem from its untimely acquisition of BG Group.

9345 2018-07-12 04:55:45 I'll give you examples: Do you use your car insurance to change the breaks, change the oil, replace tires, fill gas?

Why would you need insurance for simple things, like a checkup, physical,  birth control, annual blood tests, cold medicine, and yes, ED pills? You don't.
9346 2018-07-12 04:55:40 took my car in for an oil change and they had the audacity to tell me my rear brakes are trash and I needed to fix some other things 

long story short, what was supposed to just be an oil change ended up costing me $200 
9347 2018-07-12 04:55:38 I was responding to the comment that capitalism was bad. 
Democratic socialism is about finding a balance between socialism and capitalism, which I support. Norway supports its system via oil. Ireland has many startups businesses. The US stupidly goes with crony capitalism.

9358 2018-07-12 04:54:30 So, I’m having my house painted and I made the mistake and got oil based paint instead of water based paint. It’s taking them three to do with oiled bases what could’ve been done in one day with Water Based. It takes a little longer when your dealing with oil! #bePatient

9363 2018-07-12 04:53:11 1. Germany pays 1% of their GDP to NATO...The US, 4%. Fair?
2. US has 21 Military Bases in Germany...which protects Germany from their arch enemy, Russia. Guess who pays for most of that? American TaxPayers...Germany buys oil from Russia!  I say, cut them off! 
Close our Bases!
9364 2018-07-12 04:52:16 Suppose it falls under the same situation as whether someone finds the scent of massage oil exciting, now that I think about it. Some folks don't like the idea of someone getting handsy, professionally or otherwise—I guess robots would be much the same.

9368 2018-07-12 04:51:35 The human rights (or lack thereof) from many of the countries we import from are hideous. Roughly $13 Billion exits ’s economy annually to those countries to pay for that oil. It disgusts me. You didn’t answer my #oilbyrail question.
9369 2018-07-12 04:51:15 And when we all start storing our farts in bottles we will not need OPEC oil anymore.
9370 2018-07-12 04:51:14 We rely on Middle Eastern oil
9371 2018-07-12 04:51:06 Guyana is so blessed...diamonds,fisheries, agriculture and now oil. I truly hope Exxon Mobil doesn't cause any oil spills or anything of the like
9372 2018-07-12 04:51:02 The wars have all been about who supplies oil to Europe, the US or Russia. Trump doesn't care he'll be making money either way. That's what matters to him- not kids, allies, what is right. He's corrupt clear through.  Always has been always will be.

9376 2018-07-12 04:50:54 Nothing is being said negatively about the benefit of NATO and allies. The US paying more than every other nation combined to keep operations funded is the issue. Mix that with hypocritical moves, like Germany buying most of their oil from Russia, and it compounds the travesty.

We simply put our #Economic benefit first, that one principle has served us well.

9445 2018-07-12 04:41:42 That wouldn't cause it to burn. I let my steaks sit before cooking too.

Butter is not really a good oil to cook steak with (burns fast) and less efficient heat transfer.

Try bacon fat, coconut oil or lard.

9447 2018-07-12 04:41:18 There is simply no legitimate reason conceivable that Germany should be building an oil/gas pipeline with NATO’s #1 adversary. It completely undermines the charter. 

Calling out this madness isn’t what is setting the clock back. The actual madness is!

9451 2018-07-12 04:40:36 Why are they not having their own military and investing in their own standing armies. Germany is in deep crap. Buying oil from Russia. Won't be long before Russia walks in their front door. Have they gone to aid of US or other countries in NATO?  What about other Nato countries.

9462 2018-07-12 04:38:25 Wrong! More than that. Don't use BuzzFeed as your source. 60% or more and the former chancellor of Germany orchestrated the oil deal with Russian. Before long Germany will be speaking Russian.
9463 2018-07-12 04:38:02 Finding out? How do you think all those oligarchs got rich? The Russians hold the power to turn the lights off. That's why they need to be held in check. Same as y'all buying oil from 911 funding Saudi.
9464 2018-07-12 04:37:57 So this is the reason oil price's driven up by cancelled Iran deal ?

9516 2018-07-12 04:30:10 It's not oil, it's natural gas.  (A huge difference). And Germany only gets around ~40% from Russia.  The point is the new Nord Stream Pipeline, which is muy IMPORTANTE over there
9517 2018-07-12 04:30:07 my mom just rubbed an essential oil blend on my neck and it burns so badly please someone help this feels like i’ve been set on FIRE
9518 2018-07-12 04:30:03 Wrong on the Pipe Line dollars Oil has to come from a source would you rather that source be Iran or Iraq?  It is sure not coming from the US.
9519 2018-07-12 04:29:59 "Go heavy on the sauces..." just reinforces it's salad and dressing on a bun. I personally enjoy vinegar & oil with black pepper on an Italian style hero/sub. It's mostly the coldcuts & cheese that provide flavor. Single slice layers of triangle cut meats/cheese isn't satisfying.

9528 2018-07-12 04:28:58 Yes. Unfortunately Albertans will vote out Notley.
Why?
Just like in Ontario, FPTP, racism, misogyny and pure stupidity will combine to vote out a good woman who has saved Albertans from having a horrible 4 years, after oil prices collapsed.

9550 2018-07-12 04:25:51 The financial explanation might be ... with their debts ... and CHN control over them ... the US simply can't afford it much longer ... to secure the oil everywhere and control the price ... somebody ... a McNamara type must have been calculating ...

Now all of a sudden, it feels like India caving into US pressure. Need to strike some bargain with US if lowering Iran oil imports. 

Trump is blasting even Canada, Germany, etc. India can't expect to 100% please US.

9571 2018-07-12 04:22:03 Sure. Not very much corn is grown to be sold as the vegetable for human consumption. But a lot is converted into sugar, ethanol, oil, etc.

9579 2018-07-12 04:20:20 The all star game should consist of a kiddie pool full of baby oil at home plate & let the worst hitters on the worst teams in their respective leagues have a HR derby themselves. Keep dumping baby oil all over they ass while they bat.
9580 2018-07-12 04:20:17 I eat palm oil because many times that is my only option due to soy and gluten.

9582 2018-07-12 04:20:04 So what good is our so-called ”war on terror” when you’re giving billions of our dollars for oil from and providing weapons and overt support to Saudi Arabia (R-Did 9-11, funds extremist madrasses, kills Yemeni children, treats women like cattle, etc., etc.) Just sayin’
9583 2018-07-12 04:19:53 President Trump 100% correct. .if Germany let's Russia send them 80%

9587 2018-07-12 04:19:42 Ahh yes, those, in 80s Chevys... This takes me back to college days. It's got like a huge oil drain plug, like the lid of a jar, and the filter is under there.

9589 2018-07-12 04:19:25 I perceive a pattern to the mania.

1. They don't like oil/gas pipelines

2. They don't like plastic straws

I conclude the neo-luddites are engaged in a war against any hollow cylindrical object for the purpose of fluid conveyance.

Bless their hearts.

9597 2018-07-12 04:18:33 I think to make this happen we would need a major oil producer or a significant oil-producing nation to back the token.  Unless there is a way to do this synthetically based on estimates of number of barrels worldwide?

9610 2018-07-12 04:16:49 You're probably too young to remember when the right-wing accused Al Gore of lying about Climate Change to manufacture outrage and make money off of it.

When he would have made ten times as much by investing in the oil industry without doing any work at all.
9611 2018-07-12 04:16:46 are the US captive of China that produces everything for them and the great democratic Kingdom of Saudi-Arabia that does supply the oil for the american way of life?

9615 2018-07-12 04:16:11 Our foreign policy is led by a bully and fool, aided by hawks (Pompeo & Bolton) and marine corps general, John Kelly.

Not a fan of either Saudi or Iran but latter is lesser evil (has fought ISIS for eg). 

Point here is India can't allow any country including US to dictate terms. As simple as that.

9672 2018-07-12 04:08:35 While the opposition is busy trying to bring petrojam into disrepute, I hope we are not distracted from the fact that oil prices are still going north. $70USD a barrel.

If he gets a fry-up in England I hope he can wring the oil out of it.
9674 2018-07-12 04:08:28 Since POTUS is so pressed about Germany buying gas from Russia, did anyone bother to ask why we buy oil from Saudi Arabia? Sorry for the #SimpleLogic
9675 2018-07-12 04:08:26 agreed, but the 7th woman on the list (Judy Love) & her husband (Tom Love) opened a gas station with a $5,000 loan from Tom’s parents.

9718 2018-07-12 04:02:03 And since when did following @LindseyGrahamSC 's advice seem like a good idea. Guess it depends on whether international law counts for something or whether Trump just wants to "take the oil", by force if necessary.

9740 2018-07-12 03:59:27 Remember when 2012 Mitt Romney promised to have the economy humming "in 10 years"? They think the POTUS is a combination manager at a poorly run Olive Garden (free breadsticks for everyone!) and a global kingpin controlling gas prices/global oil prices. So much ignorance.

9762 2018-07-12 03:56:18 Its also very CROOKED on how the deals for Russian oil came into being. The former Chancellor of Germany and his cronies had all kinds of FINANCIAL TIES & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. Really shameful!

9769 2018-07-12 03:55:22 Is it OK to take FISH oil ?

When I was a kid..snake oil was all the rage

Then Fish...Krill...now Hemp

All OIL is a concentrate & is seen as a TOXIN to the BODY

If you say I am WRONG..YOU LIE !

It takes over 30 ears of corn for 1 tablespoon of oil

That is why you get sick
9770 2018-07-12 03:55:21 I hope my oil changes arent gonna be too pricey i still have one more free from the dealership barely hit 10,000 miles lol
9771 2018-07-12 03:55:17 The PC government gave big oil billions for years to stay here an create jobs.
Soon as the global price of oil crashed they left with our money.
9772 2018-07-12 03:55:02 So Orange Knuckle dragging pos says to Germany” Germany may be emboldened to Russia because of gas and oil leases” So tell me, is that like calling the kettle black?
9773 2018-07-12 03:54:58 I’m going to try her  Suggestion. Using an oil free foundation.
9774 2018-07-12 03:54:46 Germany gets 9% oil from Russia , not 70 % , as TRAITOR TRUMP stated in Europe .  Germany is not controlled by Russia . TRUMP is a TRAITOR ! Trying to facilitate countries departure from EU and NATO  !
9775 2018-07-12 03:54:41 Venezuela is also starving it's people yet they are oil rich, because they turned socialist! If you use them as an example you fail! If the internet goes out, a store can't process a card. Shall we bring a chicken or clay pot to trade for our goods at that point?
9776 2018-07-12 03:54:41 The Older the Problem, the Older the Solution

9777 2018-07-12 03:54:35 If the biggest dog in the European Union (Germany) is tied to Russian oil and gas for 30 years, how tied is Germany to other members of the EU? If Putin invades Ukraine, who does Germany stand with? Without an army to back up objections, how does Germany speak with authority?

9790 2018-07-12 03:52:13 Here we go again. NASA and scientist are warning about power grid going down. If you spend the time and only if it's still there on how they get us power, you will also know for a fact, they are way not telling the truth. It's impossible to run out of electricity, oil and gas.
9791 2018-07-12 03:51:58 Are you high?   Maybe just misinformed.  Your president has already annihilated Russian troops. And you think he’d be dogging Deutschland for an underground oil deal with Russia because he’s colluding with them?  Get your head examined, liberal.
9792 2018-07-12 03:51:50 I did the research...Now get your facts straight on the billions of oil $ that big oik execitves left with our money when oil went down under the PC government ..
They were paid to stay here an create jobs but left with our money.

9796 2018-07-12 03:51:21 CN? Nah, they're over-capacity as it is. Can't even get wheat shipped because of all the oil shipments by rail.

As a result, US-funded economic saboteurs like Greenpeace are trying to strangle not only Canada's energy sector, but also our agriculture industry.

9805 2018-07-12 03:50:12 The sell off in oil was absolutely ludicrous today. Bought $CRC calls all the way down, will be buying more if the dip continues. 10/10 though for the over reaction.
9806 2018-07-12 03:50:10 Where’s our pipeline,? If we’re gonna cut Russia out, how do we get nat gas one oil to Germany?
9807 2018-07-12 03:50:07 Maybe he needed to speak out about Russian pipeline which will be sending all the oil/gas from Russia. Also we find out previous Chancellor of Germany works for Russian company building the pipeline.Hmm. Germany will need to stay in bed with Russia for their energy

9829 2018-07-12 03:47:53 of oil yg supposedly protect layer of your skin. so that's why it became overly sensitive because no more protection. then the doctor simply prescribed her with moisturizer and asked her to wear it few times a day to restore the moisture of her skin. and yes, it does get better
9830 2018-07-12 03:47:52 it’s not an oil but check out bath & body works aromatherapy line! They have a sleep line which has like lavender and Cedarwood or Vanilla I think. I like their stress relief eucalyptus one and although it’s meant for stress it def helps ease me into sleep

9835 2018-07-12 03:47:38 what oils are good to eat ?

NO OIL IS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION !!

Olive oil was used for lamp fuel or a topical solution to trap dirt from an open wound or used to make perfume

People did not eat vegetable oil(olive, corn, canola,soy, hemp.. ect) till the 1900's

ALL OIL IS BAD

9847 2018-07-12 03:46:16 Could argue that owning a corpse is like owning an oil future, where you own barrels somewhere but of course you're not actually allowed to have one shipped to your house. So you can sell the organs but never touch them. I just don't think people really believe that either.
9848 2018-07-12 03:46:14 Yeah Notely has been good, balanced approach on oil.. she knows it supports us.  You see Ford is rollling back sex Ed to 1998 teachings.... like wtf is that., and why waste money on doing it
9849 2018-07-12 03:45:51 Actually Saudi gas and oil is what he is advocating for
9850 2018-07-12 03:45:45 Yes just make SURE it’s 100% Rosemary oil & you can really get a bottle from your local beauty supply store sometimes in the hood they have the big 100% rosemary bottle for the low low , just make sure it’s pure rosemary
9851 2018-07-12 03:45:42 Another substitution - deer or fox urine from the outdoor supply store. Less sticky than blood and oil, and hence less likely to be spotted and removed by the #Cult45 member.

9855 2018-07-12 03:45:30 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

9864 2018-07-12 03:44:06 What part of Trump outing Angela Merkel for contracting 600 Billion in natural gas and oil from Russia leaving Germany vulnerable to blackmail did you not understand? Your an idiot! Trump has placed more sanctions on Russia then Obama or Bush. Put down the Koolaid.

9870 2018-07-12 03:43:09 It's only a 1% oil and without seeing a lab report I wouldn't know if it was isolate only or full spectrum. I personally wouldn't give up on CBD, you may just need to find a good quality oil.

9873 2018-07-12 03:42:47 Vegetable Oil was introduce for human consumption in the 1900's

OIL is a concentrate..ALL concentrates are seen as toxins to the body

When you intoxicate the body the cells get inflammed

The immune system runs between the cells and expanded cells block the immune system

9877 2018-07-12 03:42:28 To clarify - 70% of their oil and gas demand not total energy needs - which if a crisis with Russia ever came about Russia could shit it off, cripple Germany and what good would they be to NATO? Even less than they are now
9878 2018-07-12 03:42:14 #FRR I've talked about meeting up for the 10p party which many think is a dream, if frr prove up the gas, then that asset is worth many times this even by paying just 10p in the pound and would happen v quickly.

9884 2018-07-12 03:41:19 Any chance you can keep this quiet for a few months so it can stay depressed? Should have some cash then to take out of oil and put into gold! Not sure what is more surprising, oil's huge sell off today or gold not increasing when traders "risk off" . It's probably the latter.

9888 2018-07-12 03:40:58 I’m fine with them buying our oil.... :)
9889 2018-07-12 03:40:45 Why do you think Trump just hammered NATO Allies for using Russian oil?
9890 2018-07-12 03:40:45 The issue isn’t oil or the pipeline, the real issue is Trump is trying to get out of NATO & this is an excuse. He is also lying about the terms of money & lacks knowledge of the process. All NATO members have til 2024 to meet that 2 percent goal. Pg 2
9891 2018-07-12 03:40:44 Didn't your secstate have ties to Russian oil and gas?

9912 2018-07-12 03:38:24 Your correct, it’s about 35 percent or just a bit more. The issue isn’t the oil, the issue is the routing of oil & not going through Ukraine, which could be protected by NATO if it ran through there. Russia receives more goods from Germany . Pg 1

They are feeding billions into the Russian economy (which makes sanctions against Russia silly) & Russia can threaten to TURN OFF THE TAPS.

9989 2018-07-12 03:29:34 Breastfeeding is a bad idea - as is regularly changing the oil in your car's engine. Save money on motor oil. Stop those bad ideas!
