1 2018-02-09 23:59:47 Remember it was reported that Putin drove the oil cut deal after Trump got elected, not OPEC.  Suggests the deal had something for Russia besides just "higher oil prices" given that as it was, Russia was winning (shale production falling, Russia gaining share in china, etc.)

46 2018-02-09 23:54:51 I was in the Navy for 4 years. So I support our troops.  The real question is why to HELL is our country sending them to many of these countries for what OIL, DRUGS.  $$$ Power over the earth  @mtry121 @sullivanradio @RandPaul @RealJamesWoods @POTUS was supposed to get us out!!!
47 2018-02-09 23:54:50 Who's going cover costs 4 clear up oil spills in B.C. &USA  coast as well???
48 2018-02-09 23:54:35 What, no olive oil?
49 2018-02-09 23:54:33 Both #Suncor and #Greenpeace videos are pretty plausible however I’m leaning more towards Greenpeace because they simply want to better the environment, they want to put an end to all the bad things produced by oil sands while Suncor is focusing on a better future for themselves
50 2018-02-09 23:54:28 Hey @12News just curious as to why your anchor @JoeDanaReports just mentioned “baby lube” - I think he meant baby oil, but omfg, lube is the wrong word to pair with baby.

60 2018-02-09 23:53:29 Are you listening @JulieBishopMP? @KimHMcGrath work highlighting the issues in Timor has been ignored. This about what our governments' have done in our name. They have oil & blood on their hands @tass1959 @DavidDmacca #Joy
61 2018-02-09 23:53:09 Exactly! It was warming itself on the oil line as I earned up the  motorcycle. Bloody fakes
62 2018-02-09 23:53:09 When your tax return + payday hit the same week, you pay for:
• An oil change (BORE)
• Next month’s rent in advance (BORE)
• Car registration (BORE)
• Trip to Mexico 4 your best friend’s bday in March (HELL YA)
• Trip to Vegas in May w/ your girls 4 their grads (FUCK YA)
63 2018-02-09 23:52:53 Came frighteningly close to pouring aromatherapy oil into my seltzer water just now. I would have deserved that.
64 2018-02-09 23:52:42 #WinterOlympics -wow!! What a show! Beautiful, bright and dazzling and a truly wondrous display of South Korean culture and history.  

Equally beautiful and dazzling though was the shirtless guy covered in oil from #Tonga oh my... #OpeningCeremony
65 2018-02-09 23:52:36 Once a scientific (aka no oil lobbyist) study is complete showing what the damage would be when an oil tanker sinks off the coast.. then we can decide to expand the port or not. See you in about 2 years
66 2018-02-09 23:52:18 As an Oklahoman, I think our budget issues have nothing to do with Elon Musk and everything to do with our state government being in bed with the oil & gas industry. God forbid we tax fossil fuel production a little bit to raise revenues so we can pay for things...

68 2018-02-09 23:51:49 Good luck in those trade deals without our oil, whisky, fishing rights etc. Not much left to trade.
69 2018-02-09 23:51:38 What part is untrue, GENIUS? Try watching something besides Fox Noise and Breitbart. And if you were trying to insult me, I'm not the one who voted for, and still supports a racist, bigoted, ignorant, inept,immoral, unethical snake oil salesman. You've been conned BIGLY!

72 2018-02-09 23:51:18 The price decline does remind potential bond and loan players the "moral hazard" of giving cash to oil producers.  BUT, current production levels are not too high.  Projections are, IMO, best case scenario, and unlikely to be realized.  At this point, supply concerns are baseless
73 2018-02-09 23:51:14 Russia supports high oil prices, not the Saudis. And both cheat, which is why the market is oversupplied. Financial/resilience demand made commercial inventory uneconomic & it shifted (mainly) to China, possibly as ammunition for an ICE Brent vs Shanghai exchange pricing war
74 2018-02-09 23:50:53 Why not let the Fossil Fuel Cabal pay for the destruction they wreak upon the land, sea and air instead of passing the bill for this to the US Tax Payers? Why is the GOP greasing the skids for Big Oil by giving away Public Lands and granting permanent corporate Tax Cuts?
75 2018-02-09 23:50:48 Geranium Essential Oil is one oil used for the oily facial oil. Geranium contains antioxidant and antibacterial properties and helps regulate sebum production which is great for oily skin!
76 2018-02-09 23:50:21 So what do we do? Do we have to plan for a switchover day when we all suddenly stop using fossil fuels? We have to phase usage out and if we don't have indigenous oil and gas fields then there's more impetus for us all to move to alternatives so we aren't reliant on imports.

78 2018-02-09 23:50:14 Would you like gobs of oil in the sand when you’re enjoying your beach days?? How about no more native shellfish for a year or more after a spill, sound good??
79 2018-02-09 23:50:13 Seams to me more like she's maligning ALL male-dominated industries, especially resource extraction - #oil, #mining, #forestry. IMO, this is a way for her to spin her #climate agenda of eliminating resource based companies from #Canada.

108 2018-02-09 23:45:58 If rural folk charged the real cost of food including externalities and without invisible subsidies (transport> oil and derivatives, cheap (debt bubble) credit to big business, topsoil degradation etc), they’d be able to pay extra for shipping. Will be interesting 2C 10Y scenario
109 2018-02-09 23:45:54 "And don't get it twisted sis, I wake up every morning next to a headscarf and coconut oil, I'm married to a black QUEEN." #ThisIsUs 
110 2018-02-09 23:45:05 And all of BC should be banned from using Alberta oil, no more plane rides or new school buildings or any infrastructure for the entire Province 
111 2018-02-09 23:45:02 You sure live the military now. But we will ALWAYS remember your lie about bone spurs that kept you out of the Military. None of your sons have ever served either. Why? What a snake oil salesman you are 
112 2018-02-09 23:44:54 well I woulda treated my car to an oil change with you guys had I gotten this tweet 24 hours earlier  I love companies that actively use Twitter lol

114 2018-02-09 23:44:33 This does a disservice to the folks who are working hard trying to come up with cures and is likely nothing more than modern day snake oil.  He doesn’t seem to understand that even giving someone false hope can do harm.
115 2018-02-09 23:44:23 65+ oil changes today at my store, and still going.... what is my name again?

118 2018-02-09 23:43:51 Alberta could have been more like social-democratic Norway and saved the majority of their oil wealth. But in the neoliberal mindset popular with Liberals and Conservatives at the time, they had a dogmatic aversion to anything not tied to empowering big business.

131 2018-02-09 23:42:16 Man this weather is nuts. It’s been constant all day. Had to go get more 2 cycle oil for my snowblower. Headed back out now and maybe after the games tonight
132 2018-02-09 23:42:08 Basically they are hurting BC wine producers to try and strong arm our province into allowing them to build an oil pipeline across our province so they can load oil onto ships in our waterways...BC is reluctant of course because we shoulder all the risk if there is a spill.
133 2018-02-09 23:42:04 I get to play more with acid then I do oil.
134 2018-02-09 23:41:52 Wonder if this is equity outflow related + oil beta + equity beta?

141 2018-02-09 23:41:00 Danny Ric once said that visibility would be a non issue by placing rain x on the windscreen so oil and water streams off no problem and they could also have tearoffs that can be removed during pitstops
142 2018-02-09 23:40:31 Yeah, won for the big oil companies and CEOs, what lost was the people, the environment, and THE HERITAGE FUND, which conservatives first RAIDED, then STOPPED ADDING TO! We don't want Cons in AB anymore, so just stay where you are DIMPLES!

148 2018-02-09 23:40:08 Btw I’m very glad to hear that your first shot it’s not oil. It’s a nice refreshing air to have a chat with some one and not go for the cliche on the first one 
149 2018-02-09 23:39:59 May or may not have just hurt my throat by trying to “fus” as in fus to dah. All in attempt to disrupt the flow of water vapor coming from my essential oil diffuser. What is life?
150 2018-02-09 23:39:59 Sorry - lol - BC is a the #1 producer of wine in Canada...and Alberta (our province next door) is banning all imports of BC wine into their province because BC is refusing to allow them push through Alberta tar sands oil pipeline to our coastline.
151 2018-02-09 23:39:58 Dry ass lookin frizzy hair let me rub some oil in
152 2018-02-09 23:39:56 The online store sucks doesn’t even have a lot of the stuff. My husband got a sweet hat from the store last week an oil drop that day Loilty lol we liked it
153 2018-02-09 23:39:25 How can you say the world turns away every war mongering country has their finger in the pie. Just another US Saudi carve up to get the oil flowing in the right direction
154 2018-02-09 23:39:24 I’ve said this before but I would not be opposed to trading Klefbom IF the return was high.  (Defence is where the oil have depth to trade from)
155 2018-02-09 23:39:22 Only got a oil change and it feel like I had one hell of a productive day
156 2018-02-09 23:39:17 US #Oil #RigCount +26 to 791, 200 higher than a year ago. Near a 3 yr high.
157 2018-02-09 23:39:13 @TheRealDaytime which castor oil did that lady say she used? Cuz the 1 i bought ain’t working 
158 2018-02-09 23:39:11 People pray for cake...but when the Creator gives them eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan and an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.  I prayed for cake and I got frustrated but dammit I'm going to put in the work and go get mine back.
159 2018-02-09 23:38:39 This guy really stopped doing what he was doing just to watch me leave lol I just went to get my car oil change lol
160 2018-02-09 23:38:21 Any beard oil recommendations ?
161 2018-02-09 23:38:10 NO DOUBT....but can you name a "WAR" that wasn't a LIE..??? For the Love Of GOD (Gold Oil Drugs)
162 2018-02-09 23:37:50 Same but from general observation I watch cooking shows and be like “why is she drowning those veggies in so much oil” lol
163 2018-02-09 23:37:47 They're also really good for fried eggs. You need barely any oil.
164 2018-02-09 23:37:46 Butts is a magnificent snake oil salesman and an expert at distraction.  He is an extremely powerful, unelected globalist.
165 2018-02-09 23:37:35 I put peppermint oil in hot water to soak my feet, they are now both hot and cold at the same time. What a sensation. 
166 2018-02-09 23:37:27 My dad goes "if you put coconut oil in the pan before your kale, you can scrape it into the garbage much easier"
167 2018-02-09 23:37:19 How can the normal person afford now that drumpf imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels? 
Same crap Reagan did in the 80's to appease big oil. That killed the industry then
168 2018-02-09 23:37:12 So says the idiot who is using a product that is a result of oil to post on Twitter

172 2018-02-09 23:36:32 Cars are so expensive to get fixed. I came for an oil change that would cost about $18. I’m leaving with a new belt and battery along with the oil change.....that’s gonna cost over $300. 
173 2018-02-09 23:36:30 I use tea tree oil and tea tree products and it helps a ton.

176 2018-02-09 23:36:06 An untenable environment... of deferred maintenance, infrastructure deficit, and financial debt? To be an adequate comparison we would have needed to see some real and sustainable progress on reducing gov't debt rather than kicking the can down the road and gambling on oil prices
177 2018-02-09 23:35:57 May I ask what does that do? Like it softens the area? I always use baby oil because I laser it so there is more friction that usual

179 2018-02-09 23:35:36 With crusts &toppings available in every grocery store, why not make your own pizza?You save money &can have any toppings you want! 
A prep tip:brush your store-bought crust with olive oil & bake no more than 5 minutes—then add toppings, cheese and finish baking

184 2018-02-09 23:34:51 I will take off my makeup with wipes and then wash my face again. Then, I use a toner, moisturizer, and under-eye cream. I love vitamin E oil and coconut oil. Kylie Jenner
185 2018-02-09 23:34:50 I got olive oil in one of my lighters in like october and i've been scared to use it ever since so does anyone know if there's a chance it'll still explode

191 2018-02-09 23:33:57 Huh? So we just went from ISIS to Iran? Iran hates ISIS. Stick to topic. ISIS was selling oil and now that oil is gone. That’s why they don’t have money.
192 2018-02-09 23:33:41 Sure I’ll go your way. Lil marco is in the attempt to cut the life line Chavez threw to Castro to save the Cuban regime.  Meanwhile they suck the life out of the vnzlan people. Bc guess where Cuba gets their free oil from....
193 2018-02-09 23:33:31 Carrot Seed Oil is used for the combo skin facial oil. Carrot seed oil is high in antioxidants that help protect the skin. It has “carotol” that may help your skin look more vibrant. It’s also a balancing oil, giving combo skin the moisture it needs w/o clogging pores
194 2018-02-09 23:33:28 Unless you’re on a keto diet, coconut milk/oil in your diet isn’t any better for you than, say, almond milk. Shit is high in fat and clogs your arteries and pores. It’s overly hyped tbh, just puttin that out there.
195 2018-02-09 23:33:23 I’m so happy da dermatology gave us some oil to put in her head to make her hair grow 
196 2018-02-09 23:32:42 I've seen on 2 sides my Mrs mum and a friends Mrs dad both had brain tumour can't operate as where it is and can only try and strink it , options chemo /radio wheres cannabis oil -- ?

199 2018-02-09 23:31:52 I’ve heard you can pop it but it’s not the best for it, or I heard Tea tree oil helps a lot!
200 2018-02-09 23:31:29 No I do not believe that the oil markets have anything to do with Marco's push here. I also do not believe you know whether I understand or not about Venezuelan oil markets as we have exchanged 5 tweets on twitter. But hey, try another assumption.
201 2018-02-09 23:31:14 Argan oil !!!! (however you spell it)
202 2018-02-09 23:31:05 Oil rich human rights abusing PR machine no-marks that only about 20% of mancunians care about?
I forgot scruffs, sorry
203 2018-02-09 23:30:44 Some BC people are so isolated ... world use of oil is escalating; instead of keeping CDN oil in ground what about US, Saudi, Russian oil?  Silence.
204 2018-02-09 23:30:39 its mostly potato starch, salt, onion powder, palm oil and flavour enhancers
205 2018-02-09 23:30:30 Habitat restoration by allowing oil drilling in National Parks.
206 2018-02-09 23:30:24 The deep relationship between #BigOil and #CalifMPAs became even more real yesterday afternoon when one of the consultants overseeing the sham Trump administration offshore oil leases workshop was Eric Poncelet, one of the consultants who ran the sham #MLPA Initiative meetings.
207 2018-02-09 23:29:54 That’ll come in handy for those oil spills in the wilderness area you just gave away.
208 2018-02-09 23:29:42 I think he's on the mend. The whole house smells of Vicks and albas oil though
209 2018-02-09 23:29:41 I’m gonna laugh so hard if an Oil player pushes Kesler into Talbot. The salt will be hilarious
210 2018-02-09 23:29:39 Triple it up with Lucas oil LM on #LORTV 
211 2018-02-09 23:29:38 I found a vape pen on my hour hike.  It still had abt third or a gram of oil in the cartridge.   I believe it's a hybrid.
212 2018-02-09 23:29:25 Liberals find oil too sexy
213 2018-02-09 23:29:15 I'm a Veteran Combat Medic.

I rubbed clove oil on the feet of the  critically wounded and then blow a vape cloud for cover to evacuate.
214 2018-02-09 23:29:05 “Gutter moves” look no further than Victoria ... raw sewer into the ocean.  Cruise ships with 1 million gallons of bunker fuel; Barges bringing fuel to the island, coal exports and so on ... yet “no” to Alberta oil being shipped ... biggest hypocrites on planet.
215 2018-02-09 23:29:01 cannabis oil (cbd) and 5htp work absolute wonders for anxiety. i feel iiincredible
216 2018-02-09 23:28:53 I take multivitamins, biotin... and use organic coconut oil and black castor oil.. and use a biotin shampoo and conditioner...
217 2018-02-09 23:28:34 The new castor oil with the black lid smells sooooo good i can’t wait to use it

220 2018-02-09 23:28:26 OMG HOW DO YOU THROW OUT OLD COOKING OIL WHEN YOU DONT LIVE ON A FARM?! I’ve always just went and poured in out in the field.
221 2018-02-09 23:28:25 Thanks now we're getting it. But can you get closer to the money. These things never result in "Cheap" Oil or Gas for "Europeans" but for the Corporations that get it to sell on. This needs to voiced much more.
222 2018-02-09 23:28:24 However, halting oil supply to B.C. as a retaliatory measure with an already crippled economy not the best shot to call.
223 2018-02-09 23:28:16 I bet you did discuss energy policies because we all know he has the love & support of big oil companies.  Since you're so impressed with him & his policies, I suppose you would love to implement the same destructive policies for NC to see if you can cash in on the big oil payout
224 2018-02-09 23:28:05 so my girl pulled up and surprised me with a new oil change , new window shield wipers , and a full tank 
225 2018-02-09 23:27:59 Lip scrub | face mask | leave in conditioner & coconut oil
226 2018-02-09 23:27:53 I feel like i can never get ahead... working 60 hrs a week bc its slow season so i can save some money.

OOPS! GOTTA DO YOUR OIL CHANGE, REPLACE YOUR HOOD LATCH, & BRAKES. ALSO YOU OWE THE STATE $264.
227 2018-02-09 23:27:49 I have read conflicting information. And again my issues of who to trust. This one reminds me of the flood of money & lies from the oil companies trying to keep their precious MTBE when ethanol invaded their monopoly.
228 2018-02-09 23:27:48 FYI: oily skin? go into a public restroom, and get a toilet seat protecter.. use that as a blotting sheet. takes up all the oil on your face. your welcome 
229 2018-02-09 23:27:47 this is a excellent summary of the #kindermorgan foolishness. in as little as 5 years oil demand will drop and these assets will be useless...

#stopkm
230 2018-02-09 23:27:42 We have to buy oil from Saudi Arabia because your party stops Canadian pipelines.. you support a regime that says and does a lot worse!
231 2018-02-09 23:27:28 i diffuse serenity, breathe and balance and put the peace oil on my pressure points and carry it with me for when i am in situations that cause anxiety. they also make serenity capsules i take to sleep
232 2018-02-09 23:27:19 Oil booming FR?
233 2018-02-09 23:27:09 Sin duda alguna! y no me imagino a PDVSA si EEUU pone sanciones al crudo Venezolano y a la exportación de gasolina ... Por razones obvias y por ser un Oil Brat también tengo ciertas dudas sobre la capacidad administrativa y gerencial de la nueva junta directiva de PDVSA
234 2018-02-09 23:27:01 @SyngentaHD2 Do inform whoever on your site this late at night is chucking oil drums around that I will find them and I will kill them. #antisocialnoisedisturbance
235 2018-02-09 23:26:45 I have a work shirt that has an oil stain on it in the shape of a giant dick. This shirt has become my favorite for that reason.
236 2018-02-09 23:26:34 castor oil works wonders
237 2018-02-09 23:26:31 Gold's value is its massive stock-to-flows ratio means it cannot be inflated away. It's 4,000 year history as money cannot be matched and as Greenspan said, in extremis, fiat is accepted by nobody and gold is always accepted. Currencies are temporary; money endures.  #gold #oil
238 2018-02-09 23:26:14 Fries food with no oil and the clean up is amazing.
239 2018-02-09 23:25:41 Yes, very good, shorting oil !!! thanks for asking. I just Love your pick about : everything covered... hahaha. I am very new to this trading business, less then 1 year, but I find you guys, on Twitter, extremely helpful.
240 2018-02-09 23:25:40 It left Trump voters vulnerable to that snake oil salesman. The rest of us knew he was no good. What we didn't know is that we had a past veep wannabe with peculiar Russian contacts & that our congress would abandon any semblance of keeping their oaths. We'll reboot without them.
241 2018-02-09 23:25:39 The boycott is reimposed. Waste of an evening, waiting, only to be talked over by an old academic trying too hard to sell ‘snake oil’ so he can sleep easy at night
242 2018-02-09 23:25:29 I'm about to put oil inside the boiling beans
243 2018-02-09 23:25:26 all about the olive oil, that shit better be infused
244 2018-02-09 23:25:21 Ever substantively respond to any of these or other critiques since Raqqa, oil field occupations, announcement of permanent US military presence, etc?

Does any of this merit withdrawal and disavowel for YPG,allies,apologists,eAmericans committing violence,incl collateral damage?
245 2018-02-09 23:25:13 I think you are going towards the oil speech. And you don’t quite understand the vnzlan oil market and production. Am I right?
246 2018-02-09 23:25:10 Watching from Soddy Daisy Tn for the 5th straight night. Cant wait for the lucas oil race @BoydsSpeedway
247 2018-02-09 23:24:52 I like to use olive oil in my hair too but rarely
248 2018-02-09 23:24:38 @cbcpolitics  J Kenney echoes Ezar Levant re ethical oil without using the word 'ethical'.
249 2018-02-09 23:24:32 Given that we’ve been shipping traditional crude out of Vancouver for decades, I tend to roll my eyes at the “no oil!” crowd. If we have a realistic dilbit containment policy, not too many supertankers, and nobody tries to weave them through the Seymour Narrows, I’m good with it.
250 2018-02-09 23:24:32 So the tax payer pays up the cost of destruction caused by CO2 emissions and spills from fossil fuel while Big Oil pockets profits and writes tax legislation that suits them and which the GOP naturally votes in favor of since they gave Big Oil public land to desecrate - right?
251 2018-02-09 23:24:30 Favorite oils: coconut oil , rosehip oil and Jamaican black castor oil
252 2018-02-09 23:24:13 #pnpcbc @jkenney I think the Alberta Conservative and the federal Conservatives ruined the oil business in Canada. They so badly mismanaged the file that is why we're in this mess now!

255 2018-02-09 23:23:52 Remember the automotive industry is deeply tied to the oil industry. I don't think a tweet or a thread can compile enough data to sufficiently present your case. The truth is I use my car on my time. It's my property when paid off. You're also forgetting loan rates on those cars.
256 2018-02-09 23:23:48 Watching from Soddy Daisy Tn for the 5th straight night. Cant wait for the lucas oil race @BoydsSpeedway
257 2018-02-09 23:23:45 That's true. No sane person deserves it. Only the criminally insane and intellectually deranged will buy the snake oil Linda Sarsour is peddling.
258 2018-02-09 23:23:39 Why are people slandering coconut oil ... are you dumb
259 2018-02-09 23:23:39 Vitamin e oil and vitamin c serum.
260 2018-02-09 23:23:21 They couldn't do much with her for fear of causing an oil slick. Feel sorry for all the Landseer lining the decks when she burst into flames.
261 2018-02-09 23:23:15 As long as you weren't thinking about me spilling hit oil on myself! Cause then I'd blame you 
262 2018-02-09 23:23:14 I’ve had the idea to publish my own sf illustrated story floating around for the last 15 years or so. My oil paintings are geared towards that.. I just need to pull the finger out!
263 2018-02-09 23:22:53 Good question.  Think it's a part of it. Perhaps less than prior cycles. Othe side is oil's role as inflation hedge.
264 2018-02-09 23:22:46 I just happen to see the exchange between Behar and McCain while waiting for my oil to be changed this morning. The older gentleman sitting next to me started applauding for McCain and said ,”I like her. Can’t stand that red headed lady.” Quite humorous.

268 2018-02-09 23:22:33 บางครั้งการพยายามเข้มแข็งมันเหมือนจะยิ่งเพิ่มความอ่อนแอให้มากขึ้น คงไม่มีใครช่วยอะไรได้ มันเกิดจากตัวชั้นและจะให้มันจบที่ตัวชั้นเอง อยากพูดว่าลาก่อน แต่ก็ทำไม่ได้ มีอะไรหลายอย่างที่มากเกินกว่าจะพูดคำนี้ออกมาได้
269 2018-02-09 23:22:24 @BabestationTV oh my lord was just about to ask for a @danniiharwood #Shower or #Oil session and there’s @AshleyEmmax with #Oil out it’s time to get Ashley wet N wild

271 2018-02-09 23:22:22 today’s discoveries:
i’m better at things than i thought
i really like queso
putting coconut oil on your elbows makes them 600% softer
272 2018-02-09 23:22:18 Nothing to do with them losing control of 90% of the oil wells they had?
273 2018-02-09 23:22:15 I know reasoned thought is out of fashion, lately, but here goes, all the same.  The popular theory is DOW correction due to inflation fears.  Inflation driven by rising costs.  Rising costs driven by +$ of oil. If oil -$, should quell inflation fears. Or not, I guess, lol. 1/
274 2018-02-09 23:22:11 @bbhuttozardari. In your home, under your nose. PPP has long been known as a party that talks the talk but rarely does the walk. Your chance to change things by standing up for those who have no voice in our society. Are u up to it?
275 2018-02-09 23:22:08 Waiting to get your oil changed sucks should be doing it myself but I’m lazy

279 2018-02-09 23:21:31 I just tell people I make oil...Cause what I really do gone go clean over there head

281 2018-02-09 23:21:04 Ah, I did the pills for like two days. Then I started using Argain Oil, Jamaican black castor oil(hot oil treatments), sometimes tea tree oil, and home remedies for mine.

284 2018-02-09 23:20:44 Of course deficits matter. I am so glad to see the snaske oil of Republican law makers for what it is. What a bunch of sellouts. They pretended for years to be concerned with the debt.  They werent
285 2018-02-09 23:20:41 Yea with braids I try to co wash it as often as I feel like it and I’ll put some type of oil whatever I have in my Hair bag on my scalp on a daily basis
286 2018-02-09 23:20:38 Greasy pizza? Blot the excess oil with a napkin and you’ll instantly spare yourself from consuming 20 calories & 3 grams of fat PER SLICE, on avg. (Otherwise, prepare to jog an extra 2 minutes during your next workout to burn off the oil!) #IFYL
287 2018-02-09 23:20:19 I have a long term project of keeping our waste cooking oil/fat in jars. I call it Sedimentary Heart Disease. It's grim, but subtle.
288 2018-02-09 23:20:03 Tomorrow morning, new tires, oil change, and car wash. That’s exactly what yo man is for 
289 2018-02-09 23:19:53 Obama and the sate Dept tried to stage the Coop you gotta be in favor of that? This is the real division in sand regarding DOJ executive. The Kurdish fighters and the oil RIGHT there. Balls rolling on the ground now.

291 2018-02-09 23:19:34 Translation: Russia is not following orders and US arbitrary demands about half of Syria belongs to US and Syrian government not accepting Syria Oil belongs to US and why US bases inside Syria are not illegal but bringing Freedom to Syrian farm lands.
292 2018-02-09 23:19:34 And now Alberta can't seem to see beyond oil. Got too dependent eh

296 2018-02-09 23:18:52 Just coat them salt, pepper and olive oil and throw them in the oven for 30 min at 400°
297 2018-02-09 23:18:46 Uncle Johnny say," Jeffie go grab some tool box oil". Code for the pint.He had a special flask for rainy days. There was a phone # on it
298 2018-02-09 23:18:23 Finna get a oil change I should pull up too
299 2018-02-09 23:18:13 Agriculture is gaining relevance ones more and it's now contributing more to the National GDP. Palm oil production has hit a record high, if the Govt can create  standard Oil mill it will do more for employment and also accelerate production.
300 2018-02-09 23:18:08 And your oil Canada? Well, I guess we’ll take it, but not 4 near what it’s worth. We will export our light, expensive oil and buy yours at a minimal $30/bbl discount (& will widen that margin). How? Because you left-wing pinkos believe virtue-signaling is worth more. Haha

303 2018-02-09 23:17:34 Also fun of car sales: you will get oil and grease on lots of nice clothes. You get very good at laundry.
304 2018-02-09 23:17:32 Your part in promoting fossil fuel is a big reason for Ocean acidification and oil spills which contribute greatly to a decline in our fisheries. The best thing you can do to help the oceans is to resign immediately.
305 2018-02-09 23:17:30 — elbow deep in this cars engine, my hands covered in oil and I was trying to find where the fucking leak was coming from, but I was struggling to locate it. Hearing her agree, I stuck my head back under the bonnet to try and stop the slow leak. I wasn’t really in the mood to —

307 2018-02-09 23:17:13 why did my dad yell at me for not getting him the olive oil when he was standing right in front of the cabinet it was in...
308 2018-02-09 23:16:50 The worst is on Jasper Ave next to Oil City. (Old guys call bars old names)
309 2018-02-09 23:16:47 I don’t believe Suncor is doing enough, they plan on reducing water consumption and emissions by 10% but they are the largest oil sands resource position in the world so I’m sure if they tried harder they would find more ways to help the environment #Suncor #OilSands
310 2018-02-09 23:16:45 Well, after an hr of full field testing the 2 whiskies will work out just fine as a back in my tool box. Tool box oil
311 2018-02-09 23:16:43 This will turn into a trend.  Canadian businesses are either stopping investment and spending (oil and gas industry), or shutting down and moving south, or they are just closing because there is no longer any hope.
312 2018-02-09 23:16:32 You should talk to @sunnygirl20 about essential oils to help. Oil of Oregano is a good one.
313 2018-02-09 23:16:17 Pipelines are part of the oil economy and I praise Alberta for an upbeat economy. ( bye bye Kenney ) But, BC has a case: it's only got one original environment. Politics will win in the end and we know that. But, that means compromise and Mother Nature knows the deal. 
314 2018-02-09 23:15:56 Such as large disasters caused by companies- oil spills, chemical spills, defective products causing death, sweat shop fires, etc. the free market may help to mitigate them or punish offenders but in a very limited and often weak scope
315 2018-02-09 23:15:54 Tonight on Date Night Dinner at Home: beer battered chicken and oil fried potato/onion perogies. Only thing from scratch was the batter and I helped 0% so shout out to babe for that. 

Stay tuned to find out if we'll be murdered @ my grandma's secluded ass cabin in the woods 
316 2018-02-09 23:15:49 Well, I did NOT select him.  I knew what he was.  I would have voted for a dog catcher for president before I would buy anything that snake oil salesmen was peddling.  Thanks to the gullible people who did.  Now we both suffer.
317 2018-02-09 23:15:43 I got tea tree and castor oil on hand
318 2018-02-09 23:15:31 Dirtiest oil in the world has been pumped out of California oil fields for decades. No protests.
319 2018-02-09 23:15:16 “it says to brush over it with olive oil. we don’t have olive oil. can i use butter? i’ll use spray butter. i don’t have a brush. would a paper towel work?”

dad, do you know how to bake pizza crust?

323 2018-02-09 23:15:08 #DrOz pushed corn oil on his show. Why were he and his guests always naming a certain brand? Too much advertising.
324 2018-02-09 23:15:04 The problem w settling trade in a good can be seen in our present situation: Oil is only priced in USD, & US obligations = 100% of global oil production for the next 60-70 yrs.  China is essentially arbitraging this around the world: "U take the USTs, we'll take the [oil, etc]"
325 2018-02-09 23:14:43 Coconut oil is good for your hair.
326 2018-02-09 23:14:35 Cannabis oil tastes so earthy
327 2018-02-09 23:14:05 Nice setting. How about habitat restoration, protection and migration corridors for the apex predators? How about not destroying monuments and public lands with oil, gas and mining leases? How about no ridiculous wall blocking wildlife ranges?

335 2018-02-09 23:13:08 This from a province that has pissed it’s oil away for low royalties & no long term savings plan. The only long term winners are the foreign corporations that move their profits off shore. They could learn from countries like Norway. #racetothebottom

342 2018-02-09 23:11:51 i used bio oil everyday & still ended up with stretch marks
343 2018-02-09 23:11:41 If oil is settled in any currency other than USD, then given shale depletion rates, the only way shale production can keep growing is with sustained USD devaluation.

354 2018-02-09 23:10:29 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
355 2018-02-09 23:10:19 We can't fault people in British Columbia, for being concerned of a potential devastation, like EXXON VALDEZ? Oil tankers do regularly come into the St. Lawrence River with oil from Saudi Arabia, Algeria & Nigeria. But then; they also use that river to dump their raw sewage into.
356 2018-02-09 23:10:12 170 for the oil change, charge it to the game playa
357 2018-02-09 23:09:43 Their aim in this is to sell more oil. Solar makes sense there as its a desert.
358 2018-02-09 23:09:04 Part 1/Need some advice from anyone who has experience with pain control and CBD oil. I am at a last resort with nerve damage/pain & am wondering if it controls pain like this? Some say medical Marijuana is better for this.
359 2018-02-09 23:08:53  right! But I’m not trying La Mer though. That ain’t nothing but overpriced mineral oil.
360 2018-02-09 23:08:50 Saudi gonna keep losing share in the only oil consumption growth market in the world (Asia, & particularly China) unless they settle in CNY.  I'm was hearing a full 3 months ago Saudi's essentially being forced to by Chinese/Russian actions.

375 2018-02-09 23:06:42 We all do stupid things when we are young.
I'd be mortified if that photo of me, the goat, a cucumber and the baby oil got out.
376 2018-02-09 23:06:30 Jojoba, Argan, coconut oil, all works pretty good. If you just let your beard grow to the middle of your chest you’ll stop caring.

378 2018-02-09 23:05:59 Why is the sector so small when Ireland is a similar size yet exports far less.  Same scenario as Norway with oil? It gets exported but some revenue ends up elsewhere or tax regime is different?
379 2018-02-09 23:05:53 If you've got a source citing soy as being problematic that isn't related to gmos or pesticide laden soy crops, is like to read that. Soybean oil is also trash btw. It's extracted with hexane and pro-inflammatory. Stay away from it.

388 2018-02-09 23:04:40 For sure. Good to know who is paying for what, I would suggest, and to consider their motives. Motives of oil companies isn’t at issue. It’s to make profits. Motives of enviro groups? Fair to question that and to dig into their U.S. funding.
389 2018-02-09 23:04:27 I think the division goes back and isn't new, look at the 50/50 polarization in your population. Social media catalyses it, it makes the fight available online 24/7 with thousands of "warriors" on each side to do the fighting. Corporate media is another BS catalyst, oil on fire

416 2018-02-09 23:00:53 @GavinNewsom Hey! Before GUSHING over our lying instagram PM you should educate yourself about his REAL agenda forcing through oil pipelines and massively increasing tanker traffic on the BC coast. He is in the pocket of the companies pushing the dirtiest oil on the planet!
417 2018-02-09 23:00:48 DZ military council are on US payroll and they were also controlling those oil and gas fields under ISIS payroll. So sleeper cells term is correct these are just criminals who want control of an illicit revenue stream. Like drug lords these are oil lords and slave lords.

419 2018-02-09 23:00:28 The Carbon tax is a greenwashing PST in AB. Most folks get money back so no change in beh. But it gen billions for oil comp "innovations". Also we paid billions to shut down coal fired elec plants in more greenwashing. Didn't work. So we now are stuck with @jjhorgan move stalling
420 2018-02-09 23:00:19 I can’t wait to get an oil change at this point the gas just falling out my car
421 2018-02-09 23:00:16 Guys, with respect the US has become a major oil exporter in the last few years. Maybe get your own house in order first eh.
422 2018-02-09 23:00:06 Wow, context. Do they teach that in schools down there? Or are they even funded anymore? So as Canadians we give a shit about those around the world, and we have this bad habit of helping others out. We don't just declare war on oil rich countries and say we are "helping out"
423 2018-02-09 22:59:45 Thought that Coalition would lead offensive against SAA ludicrous. Coalition focus is on Daesh & any forces that would impede that campaign. SAA & SDF could actually agree 2 wrk 2gether 2 eliminate Daesh, then talk out their future. Why not send oil 2 Syria rather than 2 Turkey?
424 2018-02-09 22:59:44 Before you complain about sensual songs, let me remind you:

"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
For your love is better than wine;
3     your anointing oils are fragrant;
your name is oil poured out;
    therefore virgins love you.
4 Draw me after you; let us run…
425 2018-02-09 22:59:30 Have you ever been to NI? If you have you’ll soon realise there’s more chance of Ireland uniting with Jersey than with NI. Appetite for Scottish independence is all but dead and oil revenue from North Sea is minuscule in the grand scheme.

429 2018-02-09 22:59:13 Putin hacked the DNC & RNC. 

Putin gave the GOP millions of dollars to support trump.

Putin wants sanctions lifted to get his $600B in oil reserves.

Congress prevents trump from removing sanctions on Russia.

Putin starts blackmailing every GOP he can. Remember hacked RNC
430 2018-02-09 22:59:11 Aren't you always supposed to bloom spices in oil?

432 2018-02-09 22:59:01 Sending out a big screw you to Jason Kenney. Calgary mulitinationals no longer appoints BC's Premiers with your big oil donations. We got rid of your Citizen's United crap. #pnpcbc #bcpoli
433 2018-02-09 22:58:58 she likes to use cannibis oil, or whatever, and it makes me so lazy for a few hours. -_- and I don't really need it. I have things to do
434 2018-02-09 22:58:55 Today I smell of Tiger balm and amla oil.
435 2018-02-09 22:58:52 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
436 2018-02-09 22:58:39 Both of my parents talk pretty. My dads words are more like good oil for the motor. My moms are dipped in honey and lime juice.
437 2018-02-09 22:58:31 True perhaps, but make no mistake, it is also about USD dominance, or perhaps more apropos, getting away fr USD oil before the US is forced to print $100T+ for US entitlements
438 2018-02-09 22:58:29 And they say they love them soooo much! Why would they not want to live with the people they and the Democrats fight for daily? Warmer weather too!

440 2018-02-09 22:58:17 He was warned about hanging around bad neighborhoods when he got robbed of his rocket boosters trying to buy high grade synthetic oil for his baths. I don’t feel bad for him at all.
441 2018-02-09 22:57:51 America will become oil independent and be the largest exporter of oil along with Israel. Oil in SA drying up. This will pay off America's debt ! WAIT & C !
442 2018-02-09 22:57:51 Alright. That's fine but nothing more. Where would one acquire an Iranian oil tanker. Should make it easier.

450 2018-02-09 22:56:21 Oh no! And still pushing for more pipelines for oil sands, LNG ports, oh no, bigly sad!
451 2018-02-09 22:56:17 Yea but I think we know coconut oil is the New Norm
452 2018-02-09 22:56:08 Getting oil changed on car. Sponge Bob is on. Patrick is killing me. 
453 2018-02-09 22:56:06 Unfortunately, I'm not allowed the dough. Or the pork. Or the oil it's fried in. But its a nice thought.
454 2018-02-09 22:56:04 And a butt fuck load of oil in their noodles
455 2018-02-09 22:55:52 What, no oil wells?
456 2018-02-09 22:55:46 Very true.....follow the trail since 63, then in 73 become totally "hooked" on oil, urban sprawl, MNC's begin to dominate...on and on.....debt is so high US cannot get any progress made...is certainly dreadful.....
457 2018-02-09 22:55:35 The bills that have been proposed are based on assumptions, not hard facts. Some good ideas. Some so vague as to be snake oil. I don’t buy anything based on PR. Give me research. Hard facts. What BS is describing is a clone of the MEDICAID system.
458 2018-02-09 22:55:34 You know looking at your profile I thought some of your beliefs  were sound till I saw “oilsands proud”. Then I knew you’re misguided. You say you don’t like the globalists. Who do you think owns the oil sands?
459 2018-02-09 22:55:26 It's an oil line bee. They're quite rare. The OEM ones are expensive, but you can fine copies on eBay. Just make sure they're genuine, and not dead wasps.
460 2018-02-09 22:55:04 I wanted to have brown skin when I was a kid. I tanned and used baby oil. Now I look like the younger, much cuter version of Steve Bannon.  I fight it with a fancy Dermatologist. Stay as you are, kid.

463 2018-02-09 22:54:47 Supply is not as limited as predicted.  Remember Peak Oil?  Renewables are better competition than before, and getting even better quickly.
464 2018-02-09 22:54:26 is tea tree oil only meant for oily skin and not combination skin?? im starting to get dry patches around my eyes it’s scary, this shit was supposed to recover scars 
465 2018-02-09 22:54:21 That sounds interesting. Do you drill for oil?
466 2018-02-09 22:54:11 The big issue with having oily skin is that oil breaks down makeup so after like an hour every light touch to my face transfers makeup
467 2018-02-09 22:54:02 LMAO oil???
468 2018-02-09 22:54:01 Hey Waterloo-Wellington folks:

Can anyone recommend a decent oil change place that isn't full of b.s?

I fired my old mechanic for too many screw ups so he's out of the picture.
469 2018-02-09 22:53:56 Looks good until rain or oil spray
470 2018-02-09 22:53:54 Maybe the $5bn for NAIF should have gone into strategic oil reserves so importers don’t always have Australia by the throat?
471 2018-02-09 22:53:53 No trade deal. United Ireland. Independent Scotland. No oil. Hmm. Best of luck with that. Your £20 won't be worth much by then.
472 2018-02-09 22:53:44 I don't think folks are asking for an end to oil. They're asking for the culture to change. They are asking for citizens who have pollution on their prop to have help. They are asking for env oversight with penalties that are sig. Instead AER incompetent. @OilGasCanada @COSIA_ca
473 2018-02-09 22:53:33 Ohh yeah I forgot about castor oil I’m gonna try that

477 2018-02-09 22:53:17 Foul sweat is a sign of magnesium deficiency. If they're receptive I explain that stress and trauma deplete magnesium and recommend rosewater + mag oil spray.

485 2018-02-09 22:52:14 No recipes. Just high fat foods like coconut, avocados, or just add mCT oil to your coffee or as is to help boost fats!
486 2018-02-09 22:52:03 Sadly that's not true! We went over there to enrich the military industrial complex. We still get oil from Saudi Arabia
487 2018-02-09 22:51:51 What does Alberta Energy do for citizens impacted by the industry? Send them to the AER? Why does Jessica Ernst and Diana Daunheimer have to go to court? Why does the AER underreport spills? Why do we have such lousy penalties and why do we pay for bankrup oil comp liabilities?
488 2018-02-09 22:51:30 One of my early ones was taking the oil covered fight scene from the first Transporter movie and setting it to ‘Soccer Practice’ by The Gay Pimp. Got my first DMCA takedown for that one :P
489 2018-02-09 22:51:27 I’m sorry but if u use Glossier products then I automatically put u in the category of girls who use coconut oil as a face moisturizer
490 2018-02-09 22:51:18 I’ve driven 1,457 miles since getting my oil changed at the beginning of January. The drive down to State was roughly about 48% of those miles

494 2018-02-09 22:50:49 Isco rumors are nonsense and stupid.  We need support the team not putting more oil on the fire like clickbaiting media.
495 2018-02-09 22:50:37 I see 7 oil platforms off Santa Barbara, yet heard no complaints about them. What's up with that

504 2018-02-09 22:49:20 No it's not a bad thing, but in the mean time the big oil companies are taking the micky.

I long for 1908 again, when there were more registered electric vehicles on the roads than oil ones - seriously. I can't wait.

In the mean time, don't screw me ;-)

530 2018-02-09 22:44:29 I don't claim to be the smartest man but if North Korea is a world threat, which it is, why do they still get oil or natural gas from China? Take that away and they'll cease. Similarly, how do terrorist countries get all these Toyotas? War, though be it complex, is very simple.
531 2018-02-09 22:44:25 Oil?  Lol, you still on with that 15 year old lie.  How much oil do we control in Iraq if it was about oil.  I’m guessing Bush took down the WTC too smdh

538 2018-02-09 22:43:52 Have never posted much on twitter (prefer questions). But here is a thought: seems like weaker $ = higher crb/oil = higher inflation = higher rates = tighter financial conditions = higher vol. Higher rates are fine when PMIs are rising from low levels. Not true when PMI near 60

545 2018-02-09 22:42:35 At our theater, we always have peppermint in case someone gets sick in the middle of a show. My stage manager will put peppermint oil on a paper towel for an actor to smell to help if they feel nauseated.

559 2018-02-09 22:39:57 Wonder what oil company is paying him off to say this
560 2018-02-09 22:39:55 When I'm searching for natural vegan skincare products I make sure they have nourishing oils like coconut oil or avocado oil to make my skin soft and hydrated.

In Defense of Deep Frying

The deliciousness
of homemade fries: potato,
yam, squash, and carrot.

Given deep fryer;
tried it before donating.
Advice: peanut oil.

Never imagined
deep frying, but simply can't
sauté ev'ry time.
563 2018-02-09 22:39:27 don’t want to oil my hair just yet
564 2018-02-09 22:39:23 Nothing beats the smell of fresh hydraulic oil
565 2018-02-09 22:39:14 Great trade considering Oil has support at 56
566 2018-02-09 22:39:13 I lite 2 candles and two of my small oil lamps; for you
567 2018-02-09 22:39:01 Well I'd rather be a retail worker than a fast food worker, can't imagine smelling like oil after every shift
568 2018-02-09 22:38:53 Some.  Most invest long-term & do not let the whims of the silly, and frightened, dictate reality, thus there decisions to buy/sell.  Many shorts think they "called it", when facts show the DOW drop made it happen, not anything related to the oil market.  Luck isn't prescience
569 2018-02-09 22:38:49 no. oil carnage occurred step by step with indexes. on this logic oil would have to finish day in +. besides stocks rally of the last hour (strongest part of the day) is completely ignored
570 2018-02-09 22:38:22 oooo boiiiii where did you read that stupid oil thing. Thats a very absurd idea.Turkey only wants to defeat terrorist from his border and keep syria together.
571 2018-02-09 22:38:20 Hate hate hate getting my oil changed!!
572 2018-02-09 22:38:11 They have been shipping oil safely and incedent free sin e 1953. Manmoman these people are stupid! I sure hope the RCMP arived and arrested them.
573 2018-02-09 22:37:58 Oil pastels. Wonderful for quick, plein air sketching.
574 2018-02-09 22:37:43 This is  beyond heartbreaking! Pristine ocean in the arctic.....DECIMATED by a potential oil spill....because of GREED!!! The native Alaskan have worked Sooo hard to PROTECT the North Slope & pigheads are set on destruction... #Disgusting #BeyondWrong #ProtectOurCoast
575 2018-02-09 22:37:39 The bitches don’t win enough
576 2018-02-09 22:37:28 My Chang oil light has been on for weeks now. I just feel like every time I get into my car and see the friken change oil on my dash,its a reminder that I need to adult...But I don't want to adult any more

578 2018-02-09 22:37:21 実は3日ほど前から胃腸が痛い。
痛みに波がある。その頃に鶏肉(加熱した)を食べているので、何かまずいことをしたのだろうか。
休日だし、胃腸炎でも痛み止めでごまかす気まんまん。
薬万歳。

584 2018-02-09 22:36:19 I did nearly lose them trying to go light on the oil as they stuck to the pan but added more and aok 
585 2018-02-09 22:36:15 It's oil and dead skin cells from daily contact with your skin and all humans do it to the things they touch a lot. You aren't dirty (in that particular regard)
586 2018-02-09 22:36:00 It seems like weaker dollar = higher crb/oil = higher inflation = higher rates = tighter financial conditions = higher vol. From these levels, we need stronger dollar and lower rates (at least for some time) for risk on and equities up
587 2018-02-09 22:35:43 Imma just make sure I oil my hair and trim it when needed

590 2018-02-09 22:35:37 Trying to put context to the wild hyperbole being floated around.  Calls for sub 30 oil are making the rounds.  It's hysteria.  How does inflation go up, when the biggest driver of it goes to $30?  How does production go to flood lvls, at 30?  Self consuming predictions! lol!
591 2018-02-09 22:35:24 He’s coming out with some shite lately the stench of oil at the emptyhad has messed his head up.
592 2018-02-09 22:34:42 We get it. You want to put your hands on venezuela’s oil and want to turn the country into a new Afganistan.
593 2018-02-09 22:34:40 I mean progressives, as we have been for decades. I don't mean the corporate-progressives who are interested in corporate money. Living wages, ending the drug war, getting governments & corporations out of our way to green energy, ending the oil/gas wars...
594 2018-02-09 22:34:34 I just changed my own car oil #masc4masc plz

609 2018-02-09 22:33:06 Only a Cuban can think that way. I’m glad the world didn’t decide to invade Cuba to kill Castro. Let the Venezuelan people decide the future of their country and not the economic interests of the US oil companies.
610 2018-02-09 22:32:58 "If you're going to mine and drill, you better have a reclamation plan and I'll hold you to it." Secretary Zinke tells reporters. finishes with "There is no oil and gas in Bears Ears."

Baked sweet potato with cinnamon is lovely.  Spaghetti squash baked with rosemary and pepper is nice.  Roasted cabbage with olive oil, pepper and parmesan dusting..

642 2018-02-09 22:28:07 The nearest KFC is about 25km away, but I could cut out the middleman and just rub some oil and chicken stock in my hair.
643 2018-02-09 22:27:56 Looks awesome!  Needs more grated parmesan!
 
Free tip for next time, add crushed red pepper and olive oil to the water when you boil pasta.
644 2018-02-09 22:27:37 Agree absolutely. This isn't about Jewish people who practice Judaism, it is Israelis politics. It's the monsters who lead our countries enforcing globalism upon us all whether we support it or not. To own the pipelines and oil without paying them a dime,  just do away with them.
645 2018-02-09 22:27:03 Good to my hood like oil
646 2018-02-09 22:27:02 All pharmaceuticals reduce to coal tar. In other words, just as John D Rockefeller started the AMA, big pharma and big oil are the same. Most people are not aware of this "chain of command"

658 2018-02-09 22:25:26 Cannabis & hemp were made illegal because the forest, cotton & oil industry we're going to take a huge profit loss because hemp is a superior product.

665 2018-02-09 22:24:11 WTF are you talking about? Did you actually read my tweet? Please either stop putting words in my mouth or read my tweets. I NEVER ONCE stated I wanted a ban on shipping oil. Not once. Furthermore, I never once even suggested that we dial back existing shipping.

671 2018-02-09 22:23:16 The squeeking wheel gets the oil. Make frequent polite phone calls to them VERY frequently asking for the status of the broadcast. Don't settle for talking to the secretary, move up the food chain when you call.
672 2018-02-09 22:23:15 Where was the govt shutdown when power-wielding Obama created his "burning the midnight oil" Iranian Deal? Where was the outrage then from these sanctimonious hypocrite Senators and Congressman then?

676 2018-02-09 22:22:40 The @liberal_party is waging class warfare for their own benefit
1. They want more tax money so make small business owners tax cheats
2. They don't want the oil so make oil workers sexual predators 
A disgusting group of self serving individuals who hide as social activists
677 2018-02-09 22:22:31 Fucking oil change cost $75, jfc.
678 2018-02-09 22:21:57 Soooo excited!!!! Got my tickets today for the Oil Palace!!!!

681 2018-02-09 22:21:47 (shhhh, we know that) but in the meantime Oil companies are taking in BIG dollars from us.

We are in this hideous period between a proper electric car economy & oil.

When does one sell one's petrol guzzler before it has $0 value, this is going to be a MASSIVE issue Govts face
682 2018-02-09 22:21:27 Having to loft the ball 20 feet down the lane in practice (on one lane) just because the center won’t oil my pair is awesome

684 2018-02-09 22:20:47 Is it to raise money for something like a band trip or something like heating oil?
685 2018-02-09 22:20:42 @bobpockrass @TigerWoods @kylepetty @F1 

For real, excellent idea, after all the maintenance area’s should not start to look like. Hospital’s, there has to be a resemblance of sanity somewhere. 
Uh say, could you let me have a couple gallons of oil ?
I can’t mine just ran out !
686 2018-02-09 22:20:33 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
687 2018-02-09 22:20:30 My oil change is so pricey 
688 2018-02-09 22:20:23 Well, the solution to that is to build a couple new pipelines. No reason that people in New England should be paying so much for oil/natural gas, and especially import it from overseas. (Better for environment too, long-term).
689 2018-02-09 22:20:22 @mlofgran Nothing company specific the oil sector is being bashed as gains in recent weeks make it vunerable. Ride it out like everyone else and hope Matt has the ammunition he's been hinting at to at least restrict the impact of all this on NTOG until the oil price stabilises.

705 2018-02-09 22:17:56 That being said, it has dropped the pay in the oil fields for frackers and frack sand haullers. They make most of their money on either over time or illegal logs. But now they can't cheat logs and companies like BJS are limiting work days to 12 hours. Which is why I got out of

774 2018-02-09 22:10:12 I think a lot of the poor economic decisions this country has taken have been down to a misunderstanding of the experience of the 70s.

778 2018-02-09 22:09:41 Hi Adam, What do you think about after tested $58 & 791 BH Oil Rig ?
779 2018-02-09 22:09:39 Yup. Spices are super important. 

Also, I recommend that you spice in layers. Put your oil in the pan with some cumin seeds. Put them on medium heat and let the cumin “bloom” in the oil for a few minutes.

Then add your veggies and put all spices in, including salt.
780 2018-02-09 22:09:32 Yeah, it makes me itch. I am not a fan of the oil. I do take Epsom salts baths though.

785 2018-02-09 22:08:51 Thanks for supporting the Oil and Gas industry!
786 2018-02-09 22:08:43 We in Canada have seen this with our oil-producing province Alberta. When oil was good, Alberta was soaring, but the Conservatives never diversified the economy and, the minute the oil glut hit, guess what happened. Now they have to force oil out the door to try and recover.

800 2018-02-09 22:07:05 Actually it makes perfect sense because these California protesters are paid and organized by the same U.S. environuts that have funded the majority of anti oil protests in Canada. Between funding these protests and elections we've been screwed.

838 2018-02-09 22:00:22 OIL DIFF: 3.7 -> 3.74
839 2018-02-09 22:00:08 I always say grow to your conditions. we have lots of slugs so I look for good slug resistants or good in pots. if you have clays oil and hot summers get a drought resistant one. but there isn't a right or wrong answer, if it works for you, it works, thats all you need to know.

846 2018-02-09 21:59:30 This is really fascinating, thank you for info! I tried the oil but weirdly I couldn’t tolerate it, gave me heart palpitations
847 2018-02-09 21:58:43 I tried a sample of the cbd oil...ginger...it was good!
848 2018-02-09 21:58:40 Yes, its also a gonner, a relic from the past when Big Oil made us believe they are the only choice. Don’t worry we still got lots of post apocalyptic dystopias to choose from, even better than Mad Max, like Eclipse Phase video game.

852 2018-02-09 21:58:21 is it time to short oil?
853 2018-02-09 21:58:15 He's shared his 'thoughts' since Trump put him in that job. Not pretty, Ana. The lies about Rep Wilson, his 'views' on the Civil War ... his 'views' re: DACA  ... Porter, DV, no sec clearance. I don't expect 'better' from a Trump pick, for sure. But Kelly is no oil painting 
854 2018-02-09 21:58:13 Oil $80, EURUSD 1.30, S&P 2000....

858 2018-02-09 21:57:32 Magnesium doesn't absorb well taken orally.

IM is best. Next best is through the skin. So Epsom Salt baths or magnesium oil rubbed on your skin can help.

But IM gets so much more into you than any other method.

862 2018-02-09 21:57:02 I need oil; my hair is so dry.
863 2018-02-09 21:56:50 We do not need coastal oil drilling in California and should continue work on reducing demand for it. Fossil fuel combustion is the primary source of human generated greenhouse gas that causes global warming and climate change. Wind and wave power and desalinization plants please

873 2018-02-09 21:55:34 Sounds like a lot of work, good luck with that. I'll stick to my old Hondas though, clutch slip a set of second hand springs I had already, re used gasket, total cost one engine fill of oil so about £4 at most.

878 2018-02-09 21:54:50 Lol the SaskParty pretends they give a fuck about people's jobs.  Thats rich! Oil jobs for the private sector are worth fighting for but govt maintenance jobs are not.  This govt doesnt care about its people unless they own big oil. Pretending to care about the workers= BULLSHIT!
879 2018-02-09 21:54:49 I must say this 

Any Prophet hu deal wid "Akwankyer3" x not a real man of God.
This era we dnt use Anointing oil b4 we can defeat Satan

The name of Jesus Reigns.

So my ppl pls let's open our mind.
Someone hu x choose by God preach the gospel not Akwankyer3.

881 2018-02-09 21:54:32 Why do you see self gov for scots as separation?
WM has near bankrupted an oil rich UK,look at the brexit shambles
and you want union with them,time to get off the knees and stop taking the blatant disrespect shown to scotland
882 2018-02-09 21:54:28 Agree. I meant look at oil 2008 versus Dow today. Very similar weekly chart
883 2018-02-09 21:54:07 أحب لما أتحمم أحط baby oil
884 2018-02-09 21:54:04 People choosing renewables over oil and gas is called demand. You are DEFINITELY as dense as any other Republican, with the same "your facts mean nothing" attitude. You've wasted enough of my time since you're not even TRYING to learn and spread facts, just emotional opinions.
885 2018-02-09 21:53:48 Exactly. In 2015, NL econ humming along but big challenges with govt fiscal. Oil & other commodities dropped precipitously & govt spending still high. Led to $billion+ deficit. PCs plan designed to address it while recognizing fundamental strength of NL econ. Voters didn't agree.
886 2018-02-09 21:53:12 Qué se hace cuando una persona que no es de vista flores te viene a ver? Llevarla a la plaza, a la oil ¿¿¿???

896 2018-02-09 21:52:30 What about job losses? Many oil and gas operators are disappearing due to NDP faulty policies. Also, you may want to call up BC NDP folks and abuse them for cancelling all pipeline projects. This is affecting AB very badly. Call Jaggy Paaji also.
897 2018-02-09 21:52:17 @BullandFox Valentino's in Little Italy on Murray Hill Road amazing pepperoni Pizza they use some quality olive oil
898 2018-02-09 21:52:14 My hubby and have looked into oil  and it has worked fir them. It is so hard to get it here.  Has it helped you Alison?
899 2018-02-09 21:52:14 Biggie should just drop brown sugar and honey for anheeka to use as face scrub then coconut/avocado oil for moisturizing. 
She really needs help with this satanic acne. Fine girl.

900 2018-02-09 21:52:11 Last time $XOM traded at these levels was early 2016 and oil was at 28.  Take that as you may. Or just don't sell it here.
901 2018-02-09 21:52:09 It’s amazing the @AGJeffLandry and Rep Graves fail to hold big oil accountable for the exploration canals @theadvocatebr @GreenARMY_La

No matter what, that #Oil still needs #pipelines. Let's show we're worthy of #Investment! @KylloGreg
910 2018-02-09 21:50:52 Needs more oil, I think
911 2018-02-09 21:50:44 Wing li chip and oil all day 
912 2018-02-09 21:50:38 It's a feature of the GOP that nothing is learned from history. Thus, in 2012, w/i 4 yrs of financial crash, mine disaster, & Gulf oil spill, Romney called for less regulation.
913 2018-02-09 21:50:17 add oil(´ﾟдﾟ｀)
なるほど、オイルを加えるで加油か！
914 2018-02-09 21:50:11 what coconut oil?
915 2018-02-09 21:50:11 What about EXXON-Mobil Tillerson role in all of this? EXXON bought Russian land/oil fields that sanctions have prevented them from accessing, in the 1970's? Part ot this deal? EXXON wants.
916 2018-02-09 21:49:59 Your deflecting to an argument regarding energy sources.

And there is no way you can begin to argue that our oil production would have increased under Hillary.
917 2018-02-09 21:49:44 That was the oil industry bust: employees over extended their credit and then when laid off couldn’t pay their bills and banks screwing thousands with ARM notes
918 2018-02-09 21:49:40 Or maybe a rear-facing rocket launcher, or machine gun... Not an oil slick, though, since I'm trying to avoid having them hit me.
919 2018-02-09 21:49:35 Getting an oil change rn. Chatted with another person waiting for their car. Received free bud
920 2018-02-09 21:49:33 My fellow Ghanaians, plx let's fnk deep ooo

Nw ppl believe in Anointing oil and "Akwankyer3" instead of the Mighty name JESUS.

The thing is Satan x never afraid of anything we see or touch.
  Righteous life and those hu r control by the Spirit of God p3 duh Satan fear
921 2018-02-09 21:49:20 Shower and oil me and paint my nails. 

I love service subs/slaves.
922 2018-02-09 21:49:20 The main reason for grill and kill is the self-healing - 2.5 seconds to 4.5 seconds is a big increase.  Also generally most pros stay away from incinerator gauntlets because they prefer to use both modes of oil spill (unlit and lit).
923 2018-02-09 21:49:15 Uh, triple A credit rating without oil, finance, tech, tourism, food and drink, biggest fishery in Europe, legals running in concert due to our current membership. I hate to rain on Clare’s parade but we’ll be in in 30 seconds.
924 2018-02-09 21:49:08 Oil change... every time I'm in the dealership I want to trade my car in smh
925 2018-02-09 21:49:00 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
926 2018-02-09 21:48:59 Well, if you take out mining, lumber, oil & gas...
927 2018-02-09 21:48:39 surely oil must have been up?!?
928 2018-02-09 21:48:31 which is why u don't see much change at the pump when the oil prices change unless they're overflowing on their stockpiles.
929 2018-02-09 21:48:22 Yea - I don't think the taste is impacted. Its out of principle.  I look at it this way - for every environmental "green" effort I am made to accept, I will drown a baby dolphin in motor oil.  Balance to the force must be restored.
930 2018-02-09 21:48:17 Forever thankful for my Daddy who always changes my oil since my husband works late.
931 2018-02-09 21:48:16 Starting tonight I’m walking a mile, doing jumping jacks, bouncing on ball, squats then shower and evening primose oil. 
932 2018-02-09 21:47:53 regardless of what the price of oil is per barrel, all refineries store up to 6 months & control refined product prices depending on output
933 2018-02-09 21:47:51 @ec_minister you should stop the posturing and be brave and take on the Alberta oil industry
934 2018-02-09 21:47:47 or maybe that oil has warming properties, full of ginger?
935 2018-02-09 21:47:36 Update: I applied my face oil before applying the SPF & it worked perfectly. I’m a lot less oily than I was yesterday
936 2018-02-09 21:47:01 I love these braids because you can just oil your scalp without your hair style getting messed up or greasy.
937 2018-02-09 21:46:52 Is this property taken care of by the National Park service as well? They are going to drill for oil just off shore there I hear.
938 2018-02-09 21:46:48 Y’all drag coconut oil so much on this app 
939 2018-02-09 21:46:42 Price of oil under $60.00 yet gas prices continue to rise.
940 2018-02-09 21:46:40 Wow!  Mr. 50%!  Makes 10% oil guy seem small time.
941 2018-02-09 21:46:36 A friend of mine, said if you use coconut oil to cook Kale it makes it easier to slide into the trash!! 
942 2018-02-09 21:46:18 I need to get my car oil changed ):
943 2018-02-09 21:46:14 We should collect them like old Oil cans 
944 2018-02-09 21:46:04 I myself don’t consider 12 miles to be “near,” geologically speaking, for mineral extraction purposes. Perhaps your sources disagree. But how many people are living within 12 miles of Mt. St. Helens? Mt. Rainier? Mt. Hood? They’re talking about minerals, not oil/gas.
945 2018-02-09 21:45:55 Bawt right ... but squeaky door gets the oil.... kids can always use help takes a village
946 2018-02-09 21:45:54 if that nigga tongue game ain never made your body lock up like a motor with no oil in it he ain doing it right
947 2018-02-09 21:45:42  yeah, but not even views or follows converts to $$$. The snake oil and maple syrup was leached from them a year ago.
948 2018-02-09 21:45:32 This is about oil not dollar dominance. Contract is settled in OIL & priced in Yuan (FX to $) so no big deal. Potential importance of this Buy-side contract is if China can collapse US manipulated/dominated ICE Brent price by taking their bids to Shanghai auctions  #OOTT
949 2018-02-09 21:45:28 Doesn’t trump have a secretary of state? That guy that is still getting rich off of oil! Must not trust him anymore! Isn’t Kissinger worried about loosing his credibility now?
950 2018-02-09 21:45:25 things that actually happened in real life: last night Selina sprayed her legs with coconut oil cooking spray because she said her skin was dry 
951 2018-02-09 21:45:22 @grumpyfred3 
Real reality's appear to be EU dictators,
have never had to deal with a situation like Brexit,
where threats & intimidation only serve to pour oil on troubled waters,
we will all hopefully learn from this experience,
 UK, EU, & the rest of Europe.
952 2018-02-09 21:45:20 I'm not responsible for your understanding pls,dnt drag me unnecessarily, I dnt hv that strength
953 2018-02-09 21:45:18 Lmao, reality check, cost of oil sands production has dropped significantly over the last number of years and reality check, its in a place that ain’t socialist or oppress people.
954 2018-02-09 21:45:02 I just sat in the waiting for an hour till it was my cars turn and they go “um yeah sorry sis but tbh we don’t want to change your oil because you need all this other stuff looked at first and would be pointless for us to change it rn” me: :-) ok thx
955 2018-02-09 21:45:00 Like the freedom to buy cheap oil, minerals and other resources to keep the wealthy elitist 1 % happy.  Oh, yeah and keep the religious zealots on the far right pasified.
956 2018-02-09 21:44:59 He stole motor oil and destroyed the toilet.!BOLO!
957 2018-02-09 21:44:46 @SomeroRussia @Somero_Inc how you can move the auger oil engine with the right turning ?
958 2018-02-09 21:44:22 Didn't the Obama Administration give Mexico Aid and import Oil from Mexico's Oil Fields. Where did the Free Trade Deal go wrong?
959 2018-02-09 21:44:02 Here's practically flammable by the amount of oil he's saturated in. What sport is he even there for?
960 2018-02-09 21:44:01 Those of us with eng. backgrounds in eastern Canada, could not believe the stupidity of those who did as well. ON continues to prop up their auto sector, much more polluting, especially re: end user. These hypocrites, drive, fly, use foreign oil. Total nonsense is norm it seems.
961 2018-02-09 21:44:01 Wasn't Darth Vader a right winger?  He was no oil painting.
962 2018-02-09 21:43:59 Yeah, good point, Evan. A lot of the country got just plain duped by a snake oil salesman, like people have forever.  The question is, what do we do about it now as a country? He knows he has to have "loyalists" around to protect him, so he's surrounded by people who can't... 1/2
963 2018-02-09 21:43:57 Sum delicious and some oil. That's the demonstration

969 2018-02-09 21:43:09 If the United States is producing enough oil to export, the SPR is no longer needed.
970 2018-02-09 21:43:04 what does this mean exactly to regular people who own shares; is there oil or is it dry.... that market performance is leaning to dry, so your $5 warrant offering is either arrogance or your not communicating to your shareholders as you should be.
971 2018-02-09 21:42:57 The answer is.....$500 billion oil dollars.
972 2018-02-09 21:42:50 Yes, that's the most standard. @bittman sometimes leaves out ingredient list in simpler recipes and just says, "Chop up an onion and fry it in a bit oil. Then add carrots..." And so on.
973 2018-02-09 21:42:36 just ordered more oil and wax. have a ton of balm still. will look into it for future orders.
974 2018-02-09 21:42:26 Never trust someone else’s hand lotion. My hands are turning red like it’s made out of poison ivy oil, and I smell of great grandmother.
975 2018-02-09 21:42:09 Ah yes how dare middle eastern people be angry at the country which imperialized them, invaded them, overthrew them, war-tore them, and drone-attacked them, all for power and oil?
976 2018-02-09 21:41:49 If it’s rainscreen duoslab then outer dense surface layer sheds water & doesn’t allow much penetration even with wind driven rain. Also drains quickly due to hydrophobic silicon oil (not like loft ins). I’d be willing to bet it’s dry if you put hand behind it
977 2018-02-09 21:41:44 Really wanted that is an excellent olive oil costume but not sure whether that’s an insult or compliment. Ooh, it’s a difficult time to be alive.

980 2018-02-09 21:41:19 As #Tillerson wraps Latin America tour, #VenezuelaSanctions on a slow build since July. An #oil import ban was not plausible 6 months ago, but is becoming more so now -- potential headwind for US #refiners thirsty for heavy #crude. $XOM $VLO
981 2018-02-09 21:41:12 Exactly. Think oil is due for a bounce as the sell-off is excessive. Although the short oil narrative in the USA is too popular. See how it plays out. If $XOM keeps getting sold, the whole sector can continue to see selling.
982 2018-02-09 21:41:02 Clove oil or if nothing else keep brushing your teeth in your the problem area until the pain goes away. Better with an electric toothbrush and it works.
983 2018-02-09 21:41:01 Do you see any similarities to oil in 2008? Straight up, straight down
984 2018-02-09 21:40:57 Juanuary's data of US ol mining -fine, threfore 3 countreis moslty oil into market: S.Arabia, USA, Russia.
985 2018-02-09 21:40:38 I knew when I took my car to get an oil change something else was gonna be wrong I could feel it in my bones
986 2018-02-09 21:40:36 we'd rather have corporatism than socialism because it's nigh impossible to shrink government once given power, but it's much easier to break up Standard Oil or AT&T.

I want a balance of power to local people, freedom to markets, authority to government, because
987 2018-02-09 21:40:35 Water wil be the new oil soon, very soon..... 
988 2018-02-09 21:40:30 I love the smell of Midland; oil and money.
989 2018-02-09 21:40:28 That being the case, and my being a regular reader of your columns, aren't I due some portion of all that big oil largess?
990 2018-02-09 21:40:23 Move towards OIL STATE of America, Folks, it is as bad and worse than you can imagine...

992 2018-02-09 21:40:21 Stay out of Venezuela and worry about the problems in your country. You would have ZERO interested in Venezuela if it wasn't for the ridiculous amounts of oil they have.
993 2018-02-09 21:40:16 $XOM being penalized for oil price fears and earnings miss? Seems like an opportunity here for a nice bounce in and out.
994 2018-02-09 21:40:08 Endless oil story
995 2018-02-09 21:40:07 Buying #omega3 #supplements? Get a high percentage of EPA/DHA. Example: 2000mg fish oil/800 mg EPA/DHA is much better than 2000mg fish oil/40 mg EPA/DHA!
996 2018-02-09 21:40:03 S&P closed the week +1.5%., DAX -1.3%.

Nvidia +7%, Applied Materials & Nike & Vale +5%, Twitter & Microsoft +4%, Apple +1%, but Zynga -5%.

VIX -13%, crude oil -3% to $59, Bitcoin +3% to $8519, LIBOR up to 1.79%.

46° here in Idaho Falls.  We want rain!
997 2018-02-09 21:40:00 I need a man so he can come check my oil and fluids while I’m at work.
998 2018-02-09 21:39:47 I definitely don't miss oil... We had a plan that we paid year round. Hated the bill in the summer but definitely was worth it
999 2018-02-09 21:39:45 It's a slam dunk in a 3ft basketball hoop. Zero RI oil field workers. Zero major oil companies in RI. Fed waters means no leasing rev. Workers have to be flown in. Literally no upside for any in-state voter. Unbelievable some candidates don't see that.

1004 2018-02-09 21:39:15 So accurate! I once dreamt about a ghost and came back from school to find granddad had the whole squad ready to anoint man in oil.
1005 2018-02-09 21:39:14 It’s not hot enough Easton good looking oil
1006 2018-02-09 21:39:03 i use coconut oil or cocoa butter
1007 2018-02-09 21:38:57 It’s all fun and games having a car until you have to pay for a repair or even an oil change 
1008 2018-02-09 21:38:41 I got paid today but my car note is due, I need gas and an oil change and toiletries and food to eat tonight so basically I didn’t get paid and I hate being an adult 
1009 2018-02-09 21:38:38 I bet your naked new friend uses beard oil.
1010 2018-02-09 21:38:34 Getting sunflower oil out of your eyes is so arduous
1011 2018-02-09 21:38:29 So moms wake up to fry some chicken, right. No flour. No seasoning. Just rinsed and threw the shit in the oil 
1012 2018-02-09 21:38:27 The apricot scrub is good for opening your pores and getting out dirt and oil

1014 2018-02-09 21:38:16 just a friendly reminder that tea tree oil is toxic to cats
1015 2018-02-09 21:38:08 That is a spending problem sir. I asked where and what are my federal taxes for? Texas is one of the most economically thriving states in the nation from Oil to Population in paying taxes. Now give us our money!
1016 2018-02-09 21:38:05 Obviously the government wasting millions on golf is bad. But could you imagine if they wasted trillions on an oil war? 
1017 2018-02-09 21:37:54 I’m so dumb.. finally caved and let those mall hair ppl straighten my hair... did I end up buying the straightener, yes. Did they also talk me into buying the hair oil, also yes.
1018 2018-02-09 21:37:50 Rebates are costly to impliment and subject to abuse and corruption. Much of our oil use is built in as a result of our size and climate. Whether or not we meet Paris goals is meaningless to outcome. More taxes on already overtaxed Canadians isn't going to save the planet.
1019 2018-02-09 21:37:25 @RyensAmbitions Yeesh. Have you taken care of the oil change?
1020 2018-02-09 21:37:21 Where can I get a vape pen and cannabis oil?
1021 2018-02-09 21:37:20 The fake and insincere speech about God's grace is enough to make anyone puke. The fraud/racist/groper has a HUGE trail of sin and pretends to be pious.  Those hearty Christians who buy his snake oil might get some common sense.
1022 2018-02-09 21:37:03 Yes. And after he proposed to start an African Union banking system, based on gold-backed Dinar, (no US $) and sell oil in Dinars (not US$) he was brutally murdered by US/NATO backed mercenaries.
1023 2018-02-09 21:36:57 oooh what does the apricot scrub do i had african soap and tea tree oil before

And I understand your hesitation re oils, a lot of ppl have it but you'll be surprised. Hempseed oil is amazing. An rosehip is a "dry" oil.

1055 2018-02-09 21:32:33 No trades for me today as I was away. Had AXP on my watchlist and missed that rebound. A quick look at oil charts and I am sure I will wait for things to settle. $APC looks like one of the better charts, still above MA50. Lets wait and see where crude and nat gas will go ...
1056 2018-02-09 21:32:04 I was les to believe that there would be no more layoffs as the price of oil is rebounding and oil taxes are “stable.”

1058 2018-02-09 21:31:50 Fair enough but credit for a great PR stunt? Also in defence of @elonmusk a red sportscar car is representative of humankind, consumerism, and this one helps signal the beginning of the end of oil/fossil fuels. Unlike the golden record it will not reach extra terrestrials.

1070 2018-02-09 21:30:08 This government is destroying Canada and investment is fleeing the country. So are oil rigs. Their policies are as bad as his old mans National Energy Policy. Both Trudeau hate the energy sector the military and veterans. Also anyone who dares to oppose them. They have to go
1071 2018-02-09 21:29:47 That's a false comparison.  Without consumer demand there would be no supply. They are using coal and foreign oil now.

Canadian hydrocarbons produced to the best standards in the world is clearly a more responsible consumer choice for our shared global environment.
1072 2018-02-09 21:29:35 It looks more like donut glaze than oil.

1076 2018-02-09 21:28:49 yes, for in-situ projects the oil is too deep to mine so they drill, frac and heat the oil with steam (and/or use chemical solvents) so it can flow and be pumped to surface through wells

1097 2018-02-09 21:26:19 I've not made a crepe on it yet but I prepared it for use like it said to in the instructions. Put it on high for 4 mins then rubbed oil on it. It heated up quite quickly and reached a good temperature. You can vary the temperature too.

1121 2018-02-09 21:22:45 I use my coconut oil or my keratin oil
1122 2018-02-09 21:22:34 Can also try Murphy's Oil Soap. It's amazing what that stuff will get out.

1131 2018-02-09 21:21:07 THANK YOU @CorkNutrition for taking this seriously! I truly do think the issue of pseudoscience and marketing of snake oil is underestimated in terms of public health. How are laypeople meant to know what's legit and what's not??
1132 2018-02-09 21:21:07 Me: my hanging out funds are low, I better start being thriftier 

Also me: oooo a recipe for walnut mushroom pâté that requires truffle oil?
1133 2018-02-09 21:20:56 this is dope, congrats on the win homie. see ya next year 
1134 2018-02-09 21:20:50 Say lil potna... oil and water don’t mix... moral of the story is, stop telling these messy hoes your business
1135 2018-02-09 21:20:50 Spent 2 hours at the dealership just to get a oil change 
1136 2018-02-09 21:20:41 Can tins of olive oil leak overnight yet show no signs of a hole anywhere? Olive oil all over the pantry floor. 
1137 2018-02-09 21:20:37 Only til either the oil all drains away from the pumps or fuel pump starvation.
1138 2018-02-09 21:20:37 What else do you want taxpayers to fund? We pay billions to shut down coal fired plants. We pay C tax to fund billions in innovations for oil. We pay for liabilities in bankrupt comp (Redwater decision). REDA makes AER exempt from suing. We don't own pore space. @OilGasCanada
1139 2018-02-09 21:20:28 I can let you in on one of my cheap filling quick meals...

Go get some microwave brown rice, cook that up and scramble an egg or two in some canola oil. Then combine the two in a bowl and add soy sauce to taste.... I do this constantly
1140 2018-02-09 21:20:25 This is great. They could all move onto the Public lands that Chaffetz claimed served “no purpose for taxpayers” If that's true the land should be returned to those they took it from not sold off for gas and oil leases for pennies. I see it as reparations for Native Americans!
1141 2018-02-09 21:20:18 I as Venezuelan welcome Trump's help, but i know this help is not free, nor it will be corruption free. From one part it will strengthen oil contract if Maduro goes away (reason why he stepped away from clean energy deals Obama did)

1145 2018-02-09 21:20:01 Hi Jb - We call this product "Natural" because it contains just five simple ingredients: peanuts, sugar, palm oil, salt, and molasses.
1146 2018-02-09 21:19:29 Manners go a long way. They oil societies wheels, communities wheels. Prepared to accept civility as a worthwhile tradition.
1147 2018-02-09 21:19:25 You're ruining the jokes with your "actual discourse" here buddy. In seriousness, it's less snake oil inherently than it is SOLD AS snake oil. It's like if you sell antibiotics as a cure all: it worked in this specific circumstance super well, don't you want it for all your ills?

The area is from Midland, N. to #LittlefieldCounty
1151 2018-02-09 21:18:46 Everyone understands we currently use oil for lots of things. The point is to not expand oil production, but transition to new technology like electric vehicles.
1152 2018-02-09 21:18:42 I wish I had some essential lavender oil
1153 2018-02-09 21:18:39 Absolutely. I said the other day that significant drops were buying Ops. DOW wasn’t going to shoot to 30K without a correction first. Absorbed well- especially w telecomm hit starting the week dragging VZ & oil pricing w EXXON hit. The overreaction mainstream was silly. At least
1154 2018-02-09 21:18:38 My next oil change was complimentary since they screwed it up last time so I obviously chose the most expensive package 
1155 2018-02-09 21:18:23 We are a resource based economy. We have the 3rd largest oil reserves in the world. Global demand for oil is expected to increase until 2050. If we were allowed to develop our resources I can guarantee you there will be plenty of retail jobs here in Alberta.
1156 2018-02-09 21:18:23 and you’ve gone they thru almost three tubs of coconut oil
1157 2018-02-09 21:18:05 Girl you know I want that oil **SWAG**
1158 2018-02-09 21:17:53 I put a few drops of peppermint oil in my witch hazel toner, and it’s everything 
1159 2018-02-09 21:17:29 You talking about oil rigs yes? 
1160 2018-02-09 21:17:20 Flaxseed oil worked for me!
1161 2018-02-09 21:17:13 Well i guess for the Increas Burning Oil duration. More time to heal yourself and with Adhesive Petroleum you get the slow for longer plus a decent ammount of dmg if enemys clump up?

1170 2018-02-09 21:15:53 Yes..something happening in those halls of power..they never do anything without a reason, such is the life of weasel spin doctors like Butts with a big agenda..keep up the  scrutiny.. he hates oil and gas, that is for sure.

1178 2018-02-09 21:15:07 When polluters pay, our economy benefits, or do you prefer taxpayers footing billions for cleaning up toxic sites, mercury in soils, contaminated drinking water, oil spills, and particulate matter (which circles the globe, and knows no boundaries)? Our actions can set an example.

1198 2018-02-09 21:13:04 It sounds like the glider rocker needed some a little bit of oil, and that this nurse was more concerned about herself and protecting her license rather than listening to what used to called a patient but now they're clients.

Also, why doesn't this story even mention the father?

1202 2018-02-09 21:12:45 The only thing the middle east did to us was have oil. The beef is literally over them not giving up such a $ making resource for free.

1205 2018-02-09 21:12:28 Exporting some is good. Clearcutting our forests & shipping our water & oil around the globe isn't prudent. Wanna travel then respect the locals in those areas by not raping their family members & destroying what the might care about.Smaller Eco footprints instead of cloudhopping
1206 2018-02-09 21:12:27 Last I checked,  cars didn't drive in beaches or leak oil that would severely affect American tourism. California pays more than they use. If they get hit in their economy the rest of the country will feel it.
1207 2018-02-09 21:12:26 Bring in just one or two people from Venezula who have lived through the experiment. Chavez made it work because of the oil prices and that was temporary After his death and Maduro took over the oil collapsed as did the socialist experiment. Learn from others why is that so hard?
1208 2018-02-09 21:12:19 Its long overdue for a oil change I need one asap

1220 2018-02-09 21:10:09 Methinks you see many gas stations up and down the coast! If you ride in cars or buses, fly in planes, eat vegetables that were hauled by tractor or truck, then you have to give thanks to oil production. @SenFeinstein

1235 2018-02-09 21:08:11 I mean, in as much as any currency or commodity is snake oil. Crypto currency is something not a lot of people understand, and there are clear examples of it providing value to people. That makes it easy to convince folks it's a good investment and trick them in the process.
1236 2018-02-09 21:08:11 Green parties? I don't think so. EEP and S&D governments have - and continue - to bow the Great God Oil & Gas and place their countries at the mercy of Russia, Iran, Saudia Arabia etc. Greens oppose oil & gas reliance AFAWK.

1253 2018-02-09 21:05:29 Itne khubsurat baal aapto Koi bhi shampoo hair oil ka ad karlo amazing
1254 2018-02-09 21:05:17 Isaiah 61:3...
"To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified."
1255 2018-02-09 21:05:17 That is a long way short of the temperature generated by a four-alarm fire in an oil refinery.
1256 2018-02-09 21:04:44 If you keep your body's ph level at an Alkaline level cancer can't exist. Also I highly recommend CBD oil, it's curing cancer left and right and increasing life expectancy ten fold with people who are expected to pass away within a month. Hope all goes well and God Bless you!
1257 2018-02-09 21:04:43 It’s a scheme to bury California’s polluted emissions - violence-ridden film - in enough oil that it stops ruining the moral fibre (sic) of the USA.
1258 2018-02-09 21:04:27 Blue corn tortilla chips, creamy tomato soup in the carton, trail mix, cheese, coffee, chili lime chicken burgers, coconut oil, wine if they sell it!
1259 2018-02-09 21:04:08 Time has expired. Natalie Decker wins the pole for tomorrow's Lucas Oil 200 at Daytona. #ARCA #LucasOil200
1260 2018-02-09 21:04:00 Strange how when the price of oil goes down people say “but the oil companies can’t survive with less money”, but when minimum wage goes up people complain “but businesses can’t survive”. Since when is it a human right for rich people to be wealthy & not for poor people pay rent?
1261 2018-02-09 21:03:55 que locura de sesión. oil 59$, XOM se va poniendo interesante.

1267 2018-02-09 21:03:19 @RachelNotley i literally just joined Twitter now to let you know not everybody on vancouver island supports your pipeline... I among many others think you should keep the environmentally devastating oil products the fuck away from our coast. Boycotting wine.... grow up
1268 2018-02-09 21:03:17 peridot refuses to eat salmon oil for some reason (ironic considering she loves fish) so i have to smear it on her tail to make her lick it off
1269 2018-02-09 21:03:09 Oil flowing through my veins
1270 2018-02-09 21:03:07 Putting peppermint oil on my scalp makes my world go round.
1271 2018-02-09 21:03:02 Wait for me!! You might already know this but hummus freezes well. I put it in very small containers. Its a two-for. You have a tiny cold item to pack keeping other stuff chilled. Be sure to lightly coat with olive oil and leave room to expand.
1272 2018-02-09 21:02:40 Times change. Oil money now in the game.

1276 2018-02-09 21:01:47 So I just broke my rosehip oil from deciems The Ordinary, and then search to find if they have a twitter account and find alarming news that trouble is brewing behind the scenes, and people are worrying they may shit down?!?! #bbloggers #beautybloggers #GRLPOWR
1277 2018-02-09 21:01:34 PSA: With oil diffusers rising in popularity..be aware you can literally poison your dogs and animals with certain oils. Look them up first before you use them!
1278 2018-02-09 21:01:33 Sure we do! We invented a new technology for stopping ALL future oil & gas blowouts & the government didn't even look at it! THAT's how stupid they have always been (not just under Trump)! We became concerned about the climate & the environment under Jimmy Carter! FU2 - G. Sachs
1279 2018-02-09 21:01:20 What a complete joke. We are already past our carbon budget and can no longer afford to allow any new oil/gas permits in the United States. No more coal & no more #fracking - this may sting wealthy investors who are betting on Natural Gas, but I’m sorry, there’s just no time.
1280 2018-02-09 21:01:18 Where can I get a cheap oil change from

1284 2018-02-09 21:00:41 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

Serve dripped on paperwork.
1288 2018-02-09 21:00:24 Our current Trump govt also allows oil companies free reign, abolishing regulations that protect environment & people.  It's about letting corporations make money no matter the cost to the planet.
1289 2018-02-09 21:00:22 One of my favorite oils for meditation.. Envision oil! Have you all tried this one yet?
1290 2018-02-09 21:00:12 Every time I go to a new place to get my oil changed they struggle so hard
1291 2018-02-09 20:59:53 I was thinking of Investing in Russia since the P/E was so low. When I saw the article in fit the bill for what I was thinking. It was not an oil company and has a very good dividend.
1292 2018-02-09 20:59:48 If the price of oil is down this week, why is the price of gas at the tank soaring?
1293 2018-02-09 20:59:34 Brexit is the zoo of political analogies: Groundhog Day, Cat and Mouse, Ferrets in a Sack, Whack-a-Mole, Down the Rabbit Hole, Snake Oil.

1295 2018-02-09 20:59:30 Having to choose between buying a really good book & refilling the cooking oil at home.
1296 2018-02-09 20:59:12 Hugh, I just want my car wash & an oil change  Dassit
1297 2018-02-09 20:59:08 I don't know what to do with that statement. I love them. You can't overcook it though. 2.5 minutes per side with no oil in a frying pan.
1298 2018-02-09 20:59:06 FN on MSM want's to tout Oil & Defense contractors. I will not invest in the past mentality. No Wars & electric cars are the future. I'm buying more IBM, so cheap next to defense contractors. Research these companies TECH is where it's at & so is BITCOIN,banks stink 2 many crooks
1299 2018-02-09 20:59:05 i got two of nyx's vinyl glosses and a hot pink lip oil AND that wet n wild rainbow highlighter
1300 2018-02-09 20:58:17 See it in Obie's eyes, the look  of a snake oil salesman
1301 2018-02-09 20:58:07 Soy oil is in all the mayo I can find in California
1302 2018-02-09 20:58:04 Litttl brother got a fractured wrist? Put some badam oil on it #AsianCure
1303 2018-02-09 20:57:58 tar sands is the term used by the original chemist who worked to extract crude from them... it pre-dates 'oil sands' so is arguably more correct...
1304 2018-02-09 20:57:50 FUCKKK I forgot I need an oil change 
1305 2018-02-09 20:57:45 I was up till 6 am last night. I tired smoking, sleeping pills, and CBD oil. Like why.
1306 2018-02-09 20:57:27 Big oil and military industrial complex get socialism.
Dreamers get handcuffs.
1307 2018-02-09 20:57:20 What are those oil companies doing? Cant they do something to help?
Have they forgotten their corporate Social Responsibility?
1308 2018-02-09 20:57:18 Following all in car #8 
1309 2018-02-09 20:57:15 Paid my car payment today and then came home and changed the oil in said car just to let it know who's the boss. #TheCarIs #IMissNoPayments
1310 2018-02-09 20:57:08 That’s only funny cause I was 900 miles over my oil change and my check engine light came on yesterday  I got it serviced tho
1311 2018-02-09 20:57:07 I'm a writer. I can earn my living by sitting on a beach in Mexico sipping a margarita and going Waiter sun tan oil and pounding away on my laptop . Why would I want to work for the Clinton Foundation. My mother busted her ass in a factory so I didn't have to do what she did.
1312 2018-02-09 20:56:54 No idea what is going on. Russian oil sales-fed & central banks shrinking balance sheets,dumb-ass bets on VIX,stock buy backs,margin calls,all of the above,none of the above but I don't believe it's a buying opportunity altho equities were way over priced thanks 2 fed
1313 2018-02-09 20:56:22 Those oil absorbing strips left by my sister really do its job of removing oil on my face. Nakatipid ako ng hilamos, maginaw eh. 
1314 2018-02-09 20:56:18 ไม่นอนโว้ย
1315 2018-02-09 20:56:06 That, and oil production is solely about creating petroleum products to fuel hybrid Toyota Priuses in major urban centres.......
1316 2018-02-09 20:55:52 Nah, I don't dab when I'm out and about. I do have a little OpenVape pen for the oil cartridges tho if I really do feel the need for a stealthy solution, but more often would just pop a gummy.
1317 2018-02-09 20:55:37 Oil up and lay out like the Caucasians this summer
1318 2018-02-09 20:55:32 Try some diy honey masks or raw aloe vera Jelly. Jojoba oil and argan oil work really well too. Sheet masks, overnight masks, a good hydrating face cream too. I get dry patches on my cheeks and Khiels ultra facial cream along with argain oil direclty on the patches helps a lot.
1319 2018-02-09 20:55:31 Dr. Oz sold out to the beef industry and partnered with Mazola corn oil today. Disgusting for a licensed physician to be spreading lies about our food industry.
#boycottdroz
1320 2018-02-09 20:55:28 Paid for by Tides [US big oil co.& Soros ] to stop Canada from competing in the oil exporting. Wake up Canada.
1321 2018-02-09 20:55:20 why has it taken me so long to start using cleansing oil???? my life has changed forever
1322 2018-02-09 20:55:17 @chaddukes @Mullins1067 You had me at oil based sauce.
1323 2018-02-09 20:55:09 Katharine gave me some Valor oil and I think i'm going to just keep my hand cupped over my nose the rest of the day.
1324 2018-02-09 20:54:58 # Dr oz can. not belive is advertising Corn oil and not saying the 99% of Corn is GMO . Dr oz you have to say corn oil has to be non GMO
1325 2018-02-09 20:54:56 No, Wish I Was In Ga Instead  Of Socialist CA. But, Thank God My Area Is Conservative With Farmers, Hunting, Fishing & Lots Of Oil. San Francisco Hollywood LA Would Like If We Weren't  Here!Take Care All & Let's #MAGA! God Bless..

1327 2018-02-09 20:54:45 Why am I a chubby chick who works on an oil refinery and not a fit rich girl who lives somewhere sunny?
1328 2018-02-09 20:54:41 SOUTHERN OIL @Caulfield Caulfield Race 6 Number 6 Merchant Navy
1329 2018-02-09 20:54:37 Bah - the same sort of thing was said about the railroad companies in the 19th century and the oil companies in the 20th century. Where are they now? I remember when Microsoft was the problematic monopolist - they aren’t included in this articles big 4 any more.
1330 2018-02-09 20:54:31 You know Norway is rolling in money from wisely investing it's vast oil wealth in capitalist projects, right?

1334 2018-02-09 20:54:18 So Dr.Oz green lights corn oil? Interesting.... 
1335 2018-02-09 20:54:16 This is a good way to go. But our big task is to seek credible information concerning the oil sector. Information is power!!@#OuroilOurfuture
1336 2018-02-09 20:54:14 We need to stop depending on #oil. It's going to kill us. #climatechange
1337 2018-02-09 20:54:06 No, the US is accepting dollars from countries buying its oil and the countries are holding USTs or USD in anticipation of having to pay for it. @vijinho GAME CHANGER lol
1338 2018-02-09 20:54:06 I'm upstairs now John oil oiiii
1339 2018-02-09 20:54:04 Says the snake oil salesman
1340 2018-02-09 20:54:03 CONSPIRACY: The Yellowstone Super Volcano is the largest oil reserve in the world. America doesn't want the Middle East to know so they say it's a volcano so no one messes with it and then once all the M.E.'s oil is gone they'll nuke it and be set on resources and have no enemy.
1341 2018-02-09 20:54:01 I love my papa, he changed my oil and filled my tank
1342 2018-02-09 20:53:38 I've explored Alaska, the ugliest place i visited, in an area that is surounded by beauty, was the oil drilling that was happening in Prudhoe Bay.  Its no small enterprise. We will certainly have to wait for another spill before we wake up, oil is certainly not worth the loss.
1343 2018-02-09 20:53:37 When did @DrOz show become one big brand sponsorship show,  ie pushing maxilla oil vs focusing on simply corn oil.  It makes the validity of the health info seem untrue or unworthy.
1344 2018-02-09 20:53:31 Damn, if only I had a guava flavored terp n oil cartridge at work.... oh fuck, I do 
1345 2018-02-09 20:53:25 The majority of our imported oil comes from Canada and Venezuela.  Further, would you care to explain why we are exporting oil and natural gas?
1346 2018-02-09 20:53:24 It is gov't receipts that is dependent on oil, fed taxes and import duties. Don't confuse yourself. The Nigerian people are not dependent on oil, our govt is. However, govt policies affect the real sectors of the economy.  It was waxing strong before this admin came.

1348 2018-02-09 20:52:59 1. Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

3. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

1351 2018-02-09 20:52:10 Respect, I do dream of having to plow my driveway with a snowmobile.

That's one huge vehicle though, would need to own an oil company in the UK to run it ;)

1357 2018-02-09 20:51:25 #AbLeg I question who these protestors really are (in Can and the USA)? Seems like the US is in far better shape the longer they can Control N.A oil.  Canadian tidewater oil exports are not in the US best interest, a differential is! (& zero competition to fill Asian crude demand
1358 2018-02-09 20:51:20 Why won't you support the Carbon tax? It's a done deal for the most part in Alberta and it provides billions to the oil and gas industry for "innovations" that they are not willing to pay for without our subsidy. Not a good move on your part. @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer #cdnpoli
1359 2018-02-09 20:51:02 My coworker anointed us this morning with oil a prayer. Bless her.
1360 2018-02-09 20:50:45 So,will the US be trading its oil for gold?
Or just buying back its treasures?

1368 2018-02-09 20:49:34 BS- oil traders today can buy as much gold as they wish with their "worthless dollars" if they dont its because they don't want it. So if they get Yuan and don't want Yuan they will exchange them for dollars
1369 2018-02-09 20:49:27 #Iran banks don't function like banks, they function as money laundering and money distribution personal piggy banks for the #IRGC, Bonyads and the Ayatollahs, if there is no #oil capital injections, the #banks cannot possibly operate. Central Bank and regulations are for show
1370 2018-02-09 20:49:25 Trump is America’s enemy!  Are you a billionaire?  If not, he’s not on your side.  He’s a huckster selling snake oil!  How can you possibly imagine otherwise?

1375 2018-02-09 20:48:48 No disagreement here, and let‘s not forget Schroeder‘s role in Gazprom and Rosneft. The German left is historically weak on Russia, and has too close of ties with Putin‘s oil & gas buddies. Good thing his career is winding down, and his party struggling.

1379 2018-02-09 20:47:44 How about all the women who feel threatened by Oil Workers wear Burqas so as not to trigger the men. It seems to work elsewhere!
1380 2018-02-09 20:47:42 Mostly nurses and doctors...American companies and hospitals have hiring events up here because our students are very well trained. The oil guys, fly to Texas, work their 2-3 weeks, and fly home to Canada.

1384 2018-02-09 20:47:13 Sadly CBD (even oil) is still illegal in Canada but the govt is working to legalize marijuana and I think CBD later this year.

This past month has been brutal (major swings between normal and sick).
1385 2018-02-09 20:47:09 Coconut oil is fine, as long as it isn't used with condoms! Also, no silicone lubricant with silicone toys. It may ruin the toy
1386 2018-02-09 20:47:07 To believe the Putin favored Trump over Hillary, one would need to believe he preferred a POTUS who would:

- Rebuild US Military vs degrade it
- Rebuild Nuke cap vs dismantle 
- Put US 1st internationally vs appease 
- produce oil vs hinder drilling. 

Absolutely illogical.

1388 2018-02-09 20:46:59 That’s Because #InWakanda ashiness does not exist! There is jojoba oil in the wind
1389 2018-02-09 20:46:59 Taking my car in for its first service. Apparently it’s free, oil change and tire rotation. Not gonna say no to that. Also got my haircut this morning, it’s been a good day so far.
1390 2018-02-09 20:46:55 Beard kit: oil, wash, cream, send food to his job, outfit for y'all date if you know he taking you out, anything you know makes him happy really
1391 2018-02-09 20:46:44 I definitely will! The hairspray was one of the best hairsprays I ever bought. Elnett oil satin hairspary is by far my favorite hairspray now just but the way it sprays looks and feels. @LOrealParisUSA #Elnett #contest
1392 2018-02-09 20:46:34 This is not fair at all. Masses are going through pain,sufferings,&hardships just to move around in their oil rich country. God help Nigerians.
1393 2018-02-09 20:46:29 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1394 2018-02-09 20:46:23 Oil spills are accidents which happen unintentionally. Yes, the results can be catastrophic and heartbreaking.  No one wants to see animals covered in oil.  Birds killed by wind turbines....that happens because of the design.  Don't pretend there's no environmental downside.
1395 2018-02-09 20:46:14 Stopped using my Kiehls midnight recovery oil on my skin and it cleared out. All this fancy stuff is crap do not recommend

1399 2018-02-09 20:45:16 So i said “Yo why you always rubbing your elbow with that oil....?” He said “i gotta get it ready cause i be using it on my girl”
1400 2018-02-09 20:45:13 @cathmckenna What can you folks be thinking? "Thursday, the federal government quietly approved BP Canada’s plan to drill up to seven deep exploration wells off the coast of Nova Scotia between 2018 and 2022."  Oil is a twilight industry.
1401 2018-02-09 20:44:58 Good news today: our paper "Using wild olives in breeding programs: implications on oil quality composition" from a collaboration @IfapaJunta @IAS_CSIC has been accepted for publication in @FrontPlantSci and will be soon available

1407 2018-02-09 20:43:59 Because oil coming into Canada is coming from Saudi Arabia and environmentalist (aka liberals) have to protect their main source of support.
1408 2018-02-09 20:43:55 Possible coolant or oil leak
1409 2018-02-09 20:43:49 My mum used palm oil on my daughter after I was discharged. I heard it prevents body odor.
1410 2018-02-09 20:43:49 Thanks for some inspiration! I used this idea today with Y13 writing an essay evaluating impacts of oil prices on oil exploration by TNCs! 
1411 2018-02-09 20:43:46 *walks in to get an oil change*

1413 2018-02-09 20:43:32 for combo skin their cleanser is very good as well as their mega green mask, super bounce or pure serum and priming moisturizer. i also love the body wash/ oil in general for all skin types
1414 2018-02-09 20:43:31 OMG OMG I WATCHED THAT OIL FLIPPED OUT
1415 2018-02-09 20:43:28 Shapiro and rational go together like peanut butter and motor oil
1416 2018-02-09 20:43:14 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penney; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

1418 2018-02-09 20:42:57 I hate those “natural” and “oil infused” shampoos... they literally dry my shit out and make dreads...
1419 2018-02-09 20:42:57 Fats really do help with satiety. I like olive oil and salmon (has protein, but still).
1420 2018-02-09 20:42:54 "We have drilled a hole in the ground, it's been challenging because we are a bunch of clowns, nope there is no oil, thanks for playing. (send prayers and cash)" $ZN

1422 2018-02-09 20:42:42 This woman and the Liberals are on crack. I have worked in the oil gas, TransCanada, spectra and few more. stuff @ec_minister are touting, the pipeline companies them self’s have been implementing for years. You can’t even leave toilet paper behind. Codes of conducts also. 1/2

1424 2018-02-09 20:42:26 Who the fuck risks their lives in a snow storm to come into a car dealership to get a fucking oil change? Like Jesus Christ stay home
1425 2018-02-09 20:42:13 Not any more (frightened to admit have eaten all but three bits of cauliflower)  Was based on a I think Food52 recipe but can’t now find. Whole cauliflower, halve, cut in 1cm thick slices, discard any big stalks. Toss w tbsp oil, drained capers + jalapeños. Roast.
1426 2018-02-09 20:42:02 When your a shit club with no fans no world class players no youth system a lucky manager and oil as your revenue.... but your pissing the league 
1427 2018-02-09 20:41:53 But no activist with ever admit it, let alone protest it.  They’re paid to attack only Alberta oil.  Hypocrisy with a dash of blinding stupidity.

1432 2018-02-09 20:41:39 I have to admit, the margins are better than the snake oil business.
1433 2018-02-09 20:41:38 See your neck like wetyn dem they use extract crude oil
1434 2018-02-09 20:41:35 It's not just the stock market that's down; oil prices closing below $60 a barrel for the first time this year -- news at 3:00.
1435 2018-02-09 20:41:33 Getting my oil changed on lunch is pretty severe adulting.
1436 2018-02-09 20:41:23 The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill was a major disaster. The Trump admin'n, Big Oil & their allies don't care if they ruin our coast. Most of them & their loved ones don't live here. Solar is the way to go if we want to save Earth, our home.
1437 2018-02-09 20:41:22 Got my oil changed last week and I kept smelling this crazy smell.. turns out they never put the cap back on I’ve been smelling burning oil for a straight week lmao 
1438 2018-02-09 20:41:21 the lyrics: all i wanna do is have some fun, until the sun comes up over Santa Monica boulevard

1445 2018-02-09 20:40:23 Instead of colouring in your stretch marks and calling yourself brave you can actually treat it with tissue oil, and if you are proud of your stretch marks and period stains, it doesn't make you brave. And btw, that's not art, that's disgusting.
1446 2018-02-09 20:40:22 Snake oil is probably my least favorite GT song but I feel you. I don't think it bothers me too much because of all the layers they have with Elliots voice. I think if they had lead guitar parts and all of his harmonies it would sound a bit busy
1447 2018-02-09 20:40:18 For oil the THC content has to be below 0.2% @cannabis_trades
1448 2018-02-09 20:40:13 How long does a half g of oil last?

1450 2018-02-09 20:39:57 Between federal and state tax now a little over $0.49 per gallon is tax. Most people think it's the evil oil companies but in reality 20% is tax.
1451 2018-02-09 20:39:53 a) agree...mostly
b) totally lost on the analogy; Didn't Armageddon take place on an oil rig and an asteroid?
c) Did Georgetown really put out a journal on cybersecurity in print only? Can't pull full article off of the google books link
1452 2018-02-09 20:39:49 we all knew Borak Insane Obama funded terrorists. He also gave them arms, bought illegal oil from them, warned them when our military was going to strike. For Christ sake he's a muslim, he was obeying his religion. So when does he face the punishment for treason.

1456 2018-02-09 20:39:19 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
1457 2018-02-09 20:39:10 if you ask the people friendly, they are very accomadating

by the way, plastic is not plastic
there's organic plastic and plastic made of oil. And even plastic made of oil is very different each.
1458 2018-02-09 20:38:56 They’ll have oil derricks and strip mines and freeloading cattle - if current trends continue 
1459 2018-02-09 20:38:46 I'm no expert by any means. Just someone interested in thse things , try and look at all sides and possible consequences
1460 2018-02-09 20:38:42 I think you will find that the US could also be supporting Turkey.  Remember the US wants to "grab all Syrian oil", hence their "friendship" with the Kurds, in eastern Syria where all the oil wells are.
1461 2018-02-09 20:38:39 You called an economy of almost 200 million people dependant largely on oil and importation with few raw materials packaging factories  with all its potential vulnerable to exchange rates and banks facing liquidity crises soon after implementation of TSA a waxing strong economy.
1462 2018-02-09 20:38:33 Was it in the national interest, for BIG OIL to drill, at the UNITED STATES NAVAL OIL RESERVE, at TEAPOT DOME?

1465 2018-02-09 20:38:04 I tried the Satin Oil Hairspray and it’s a very light smell, not like normal hairsprays. No harshness..it almost smells more like a hair oil and I love hair oils!
1466 2018-02-09 20:37:34 Leave the Oil in Soil
1467 2018-02-09 20:37:26 Everybody saying Trump isn’t being hard on Russia is discounting the increase of oil drilling. That will break the Putin Government. That’s a real sanction on Putin.

1472 2018-02-09 20:37:01 At this rate, water would be a commodity traded on the Stock Exchange. Soon, it would be a norm to follow the price of a litre of water, like oil & others, all because of shenanigans happening in Cape Town. Cape Town's own watergate, how apt.

1478 2018-02-09 20:36:07 You are ignoring the fact that you can’t find a scientist that questions global warming that doesn’t also have a connection to a PR firm. You ignore that they did the same thing with cigarettes that they are now doing with oil. Cigarettes cause cancer. Oil causes global warming.
1479 2018-02-09 20:36:07 Guys one time my roomate was fighting with her boyfriend and she was getting pretty heated so I nonchalantly put some lavender essential oil in my oil diffuser and after a couple minutes she quiets down and very calmly goes “that smells good”
1480 2018-02-09 20:36:03 Art, giving a look to your last presentation where you remark the difference between light oil and heavy oil I deduct, if opec+ cuts remain in place, we will see a huge increase in  brent price and again an increase of spread between wti and brent. Do you agree?
1481 2018-02-09 20:35:28 @POTUS JUST SIGNED THE BILL and OUR MILITARY right away within a sec GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN EVER ( AS @POTUS SAYS ) ... IS THIS THE MIRACLE OF CBD OIL MASSAGE ON OUR BRAIN !!!
1482 2018-02-09 20:35:16 If we are putting "America first", then why are we exporting oil and natural gas?  Perhaps we could just be honest and say this is nothing more than a handout to the oil and gas industry.

1484 2018-02-09 20:34:51 I dated a Russian. He was a light Russian in that his hair was Sandy coloured. He had dark puppy dog eyes and he spoke slow with just enough of an accent to sound elite. He was a top of his class chemical engineer commissioned & Summer employed in oil refinery away from Toronto.
1485 2018-02-09 20:34:41 You mean to tell me the whole world who can't agree on anything got together, to make sure our environment is safe for the whole world? No one wants his pipelines! California is suing him! Hes not getting that oil from the beaches.
1486 2018-02-09 20:34:34 @NHL Hope all is well! Just have a slight issue with an assist that was given to draisitl in the lightning oil game on  feb 5/18 cmd was credited for the 6th goal , however it was Kunitz kicking it in after a save from Vasilevsky. It should be an unassisted Goal with no helpers

1489 2018-02-09 20:34:00 How does a driver in F1 using this design canopy deal with oil from following cars in front over an hour or so, and then say a rain shower, worse still at an evening race under flood lights, he can’t just open a visor, or lean forward and wipe the screen.
1490 2018-02-09 20:33:53 Wine, steak, water, vodka, airlines, magazine...all failed. 

In fact during campaign it was mentioned that he’d have more $ today if he just invested his daddy’s startup $. 

You got duped by a snake oil salesman hocking MAGA tonic.

1501 2018-02-09 20:31:13 And you accuse Horgan of playing politics? Horgan protects the well-being of Canada’s coast line then Notley pits BC’s small wine businesses against AB’s multi-national oil and gas giants? Gimme a fucking break. Why didn’t she offer to discuss BC’s concerns before retaliation?
1502 2018-02-09 20:31:09 So I'm getting my oil changed and when I came in I was the only one in the waiting room and I chose a comfy chair. A man came in and chose the other one straight across from me when there are literally 8 other chairs in the waiting room. I feel awkward
1503 2018-02-09 20:31:09 $CET.CA is getting a bit overdone IMO, 5x TTM aEBITDA which includes a Q4 2016 number when oil activity was much lower, trading at half of book with no goodwill, 3/4 revs come from the US, i think its pricing in a oil collapse to $45 at this level
1504 2018-02-09 20:31:07 A horrible dictator spent the national oil company’s revenues like it was their personal purse, bankrupting a perfectly viable nation and your point is what? Dictators are bad? Yep. Greed is bad? Yep. Starving a nation is bad? Yep. Greed and dictatorship equals climate change????

1515 2018-02-09 20:29:46 The pennies are gone between the price of gas and oil and a rate hike from my phone carrier. That went fast.

1519 2018-02-09 20:29:25 Gee Andrew do you know a safer way to move oil?...if so let’s hear it...until we don’t need oil that’s reality. Oil dependence is on the road out but we aren’t there yet...we are just far enough along where it is not practical to build our own refinery.
1520 2018-02-09 20:29:22 i’m actually pretty happy my dad taught me how to change oil for my car, bc that’s just more money i won’t have to spend!!
1521 2018-02-09 20:29:21 My industrial got a keloid but tea tree oil got it to go away!
1522 2018-02-09 20:28:59 Late monthly reminder to sharpen and oil your knives and blades. Makes cooking and other things more pleasant when your tools cut and slice well.
1523 2018-02-09 20:28:49 please stay
my oil self
1524 2018-02-09 20:28:38 everyone hates on coconut oil but uhhhh I like it
1525 2018-02-09 20:28:27 be interesting to see how they manage with oil, spray, rubber and variable sun positions.
1526 2018-02-09 20:28:09 I have a lot of tattoos Dave, with dry and sensitive Scottish skin, and living in Canada I can honestly say exfoliating and moisturizing with something that absorbs deeply such as coconut oil or almond oil will keep them from looking dry and faded.
1527 2018-02-09 20:28:02 They do in California all the time. They also protest oil from abroad. Why would you think they don't?
1528 2018-02-09 20:27:42 Or perhaps a sign that the addiction issue and chronic pain issue really are two very different topics that mix about as well as oil & water. One can accomplish the feat if they understand a bit of chemistry & making emulsions but anyone else trying will just end up with a mess.
1529 2018-02-09 20:27:36 wonwoo wrote his lines in Thinkin’ About You
“The petals falling effortlessly are us who were beautifully at bloom”
(things can fall apart just as easily as they blossomed)
“An oil painting where even the trickles were beauty”
(even the downs were good so the end was unexpected)
1530 2018-02-09 20:27:15 Everyone knows a girl who swears essential oils changed her life.      And that girl is me hello of course I’d love to tell you about the therapeutic benefits of lavender oil I’m glad you asked
1531 2018-02-09 20:27:05 Yes I sold half yesterday and half today at open lol. As long as it's positive trade gotta be happy lol. I can't believe how fast oil dropped under 60
1532 2018-02-09 20:26:55 can i teach y'all how to change yr oil so u don't have to pay money @ a shop
1533 2018-02-09 20:26:55 It stopped on mars for an oil change n new tires
1534 2018-02-09 20:26:51 “tr*mp has added more jobs and unemployment is at an all time low! ”

as if people are lining up at the door to work construction, manufacturing, and on oil rigs
1535 2018-02-09 20:26:48 Long $OIL into wend here w a gslo stop .
1536 2018-02-09 20:26:39 @realDonaldTrump Stop throwing money at the military like it will solve all our problems.  Who are our adversaries?  Russia, North Korea and Iran?  Just subsidize the oil and gas industry and we can bankrupt Iran and Russia in 3 years.  NK will take care of itself.
1537 2018-02-09 20:26:25 my ideal way of falling asleep at all times: lavender oil in my diffuser, salt lamp ON, our endless numbered days playing softly in the background
1538 2018-02-09 20:26:20 If you want the best way to keep from catching colds or flu simply stir 1 teaspoon of coconut oil in you coffe, soup or other food. This oil can even kill 93% of cancer cells in the colon of a person with colon cancer. For more info email me at coconut@hometel.com
1539 2018-02-09 20:26:14 @BBNaija  Are the guys worth this 45 Million at all, not remorse Biggy their next food supply should be garri and palm oil.
1540 2018-02-09 20:26:13 Again that is without doubt. Thatcher squandered billions as she used oil revenue to pay for the destruction of heavy industry or privatisation of public utilities. One only has to look to Norway as a model of what COULD have been done. But it’s not about past management.
1541 2018-02-09 20:25:45 Nobody knows and there are many variables, known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Climate 'experts' can't explain tremendous changes in climate spanning millenia, yet confidently claim raising atmospheric CO2 concentration from 0.0003% to 0.0004% is dangerous. Snake oil.
1542 2018-02-09 20:25:44 Warning: oil drilling off RI's coast
1543 2018-02-09 20:25:40 I have finally found the perfect hob temperature, pan, and oil combination for a perfect fried egg in this kitchen and I AM ECSTATIC
1544 2018-02-09 20:25:38 In his illustrative work, Frazetta gave people what they asked him for. In his oil paintings, he did what he wanted. #SciFiChat
1545 2018-02-09 20:25:33 With just 2 teams opting out in the D-10 4A girls basketball playoffs:
Mercyhurst Prep, Oil City - 14 days between last reg. season game and playoffs
Villa Maria - 19 days between last reg. season game and playoffs
#blamesixclasses
1546 2018-02-09 20:25:32 Whoa what’s wrong with palm oil tho
1547 2018-02-09 20:25:24 Why would anyone invest in oil nowadays?  
1548 2018-02-09 20:25:19 I'm worried that Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement. Trump supports coal & oil which are dying industries. Tech will replace a lot of things we use that stuff for. We need to focus on Solar energy, which he is also trying to fuck up.
1549 2018-02-09 20:25:10 Better yet send them to Yemen to help them fight the Saudi's in protest of their oil industry.  

The ultimate irony would be getting mowed down by some of the recently supplied Canadian weapons.
1550 2018-02-09 20:24:55 You just answered your own question. Canadian manufacturing exports thrive when the dollar is low. During the last big hike in oil prices, our dollar was up to $1.10 US. Manufacturing exports went way down and, as I understand it, some 400,000 manufacturing jobs were lost.
1551 2018-02-09 20:24:39 Even though popcorn is prepared in the same pot under the same heat, in the same oil, They don't pop at the same time.

So, never compare yourself to others, your turn to pop is coming!
1552 2018-02-09 20:24:21 God forbid, but if the international crude oil prices reaches $ 120 per barrel all your efficient hands will move out of the window. As it is under your incapable hands that India has lost the oil bonanza that India got for 4 yrs due to low international crude oil prices.
1553 2018-02-09 20:24:17 I just need my oil changed. I don’t want to buy a new car so please leave me alone.
1554 2018-02-09 20:24:09 XOM paid a 0.77 dividend today so its pretty much flat. Very oversold on the daily. Will bounce next week now that oil hit key support.
1555 2018-02-09 20:24:08 True 
Her book is like an oil mixed with water
1556 2018-02-09 20:24:05 My husband just came home with CBD oil for pup... hoping this helps her chronic itching, diarrhea & overall craziness 
1557 2018-02-09 20:23:45 Thats oil to $20 so
1558 2018-02-09 20:23:41 Better using coconut oil, might get regrowth #BoostTorbay
1559 2018-02-09 20:23:37 The Three Rules:
1. Brush your teeth.
2. Don't buy products made with palm oil.
3. Ostracize abusers in your communities.
1560 2018-02-09 20:23:33 I did an LCA a while back for a Sunoco ethanol + corn oil plant (formerly making beer) that captured CO2 & sold it to the beverage industry. Its possible to capture cheaply, but storing it=$$$. Why don't more ethanol plants try CCS? (or fertilizer plants, also w/ dense/pure CO2)
1561 2018-02-09 20:23:10 Ok, the palm oil is for the baby's first bath abi
1562 2018-02-09 20:23:08 @LadyLadyj Right now my cellphone-suspended bcuz I couldn’t afford 2 pay a big bill after Christmas. I need an oil change(I pay)& newtires
1563 2018-02-09 20:22:53 something green-blue-purple oil slick iridescent like a junebug
1564 2018-02-09 20:22:47 Thank god for CBD oil. It’s the only thing keeping me functioning at the moment. I can tell when it kicks in too, because all the pain in my joints and shoulders just magically melt away.
1565 2018-02-09 20:22:46 So for those against pipelines suggest we buy oil instead from Saudi? Or ship it by rail?
1566 2018-02-09 20:22:38 @PrimeMinisterMo PM. You must also explain to Citizens of India what your govt did for oil price money $40 per barrel. Rahul said when UPA was in power it was $140. Savings of 100 dollar per barrel what your govt did ? It is around 1,40,000 crores
1567 2018-02-09 20:22:37 Oil Blue Monday is straight fire though
1568 2018-02-09 20:22:14 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
1569 2018-02-09 20:22:08 Signed up with @RobinhoodApp today and upon approval was gifted a share of Chesapeake Energy (a oil & gas exploration/production company). Perhaps offering a sustainability preference would help avoid such ironies in the future. #stocks #oilandgas #imacleanenergguy
1570 2018-02-09 20:22:06 You monster! Imagine putting the future prosperity of your nation above the snake oil car boot sale of climate scammery..
1571 2018-02-09 20:22:06 The amount of oil that came with my wings from @BreWingZ
1572 2018-02-09 20:22:00 When a "world class" recovery plan means 15% of bitumen spilled, those of us who were around for Exxon Valdez, etc. are right to roll our eyes. Been on those beaches thick with oil, birds dying, Indigenous people watching clam beds die? This is a shameful piece.
1573 2018-02-09 20:21:57 # fraudiola never built team bank rolled every where he been worship him city nothing before oil sheiks came plastic club
1574 2018-02-09 20:21:54 It's not about if countries need the oil they buy from other countries.  What matters is where we were and where we're going that causes massive price fluctuations.  A 1% move in supply or demand causes a 20-30$ move over a year....
1575 2018-02-09 20:21:51 La cena fue en la casa de PPK con presencia de Toledo, Quijandria y Ray Hunt donde se trato cambiar leyes para beneficiar a Hunt Oil. Asi lo declaro Ray Hunt a The Wall Street Journal.
1576 2018-02-09 20:21:49 WHERE TF CAN I GET MY OIL CHANGED IN HUNTSVILLE? Nigga gone tell me $40 bucks to change my oil. Def need to smoke whatever that nigga on.
1577 2018-02-09 20:21:49 Won ma fin sira ni o.
The baby is rubbed with palm oil, epsom salt is dissolved in warm water. (the water is used for the bathing proper). Black soap and kain kain is used.
1578 2018-02-09 20:21:38 many people lost fortunes trying to predict oil moves, be prepared for both sides, follow the trend with proper risk/reward.. if it dont manage short term bounce from here. it will crash heavy ..
1579 2018-02-09 20:21:33 Yeah! The fact god-man-child #dotard has not locked up all his political opponents is unamerican! He only has this lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist and state sponsored @FoxNews to push his debunked claims!! #maga #dupes
1580 2018-02-09 20:21:29 Oh? I didn't know about the palm oil. Yes o, I plan to have my ose dúdú handy. Liquid, mixed with essential/carrier oils

1582 2018-02-09 20:20:57 me 2 some bitch i hate: coconut oil is sooo good for ur skin u should use it after the st ives apricot scrub...also make sure to use metal spoons to mix clay masks :)
1583 2018-02-09 20:20:35 I have hard to hold hair when I curl it as well, I was sent the Satin oil #Elnett spray but I would recommend trying the Extra Strong Hold #Elnett spray. I had to use a lot of the Satin spray to get a good hold but I’ve heard better reviews from the Extra Strong version.
1584 2018-02-09 20:20:33 Melhor protetor solar é o da Vichy pprt!!! Só usava La Roche que é mais caro e msm falando que era oil free eu não sentia que era, agora esse da Vichy é msm
1585 2018-02-09 20:20:32 The reason it's especially mystifying in the crypto context is that these are all social networks, unlike an oil company.
1586 2018-02-09 20:20:24 Spent 100$ at this car place.. I came for an oil change and drove away with an oil change,  oil fluid cleaning system and new air filter.  #WhyNot
1587 2018-02-09 20:20:24 well in that case put some baby oil by the stairs they can't prove you did it when they take their tumble you're welcome
1588 2018-02-09 20:20:14 That sounds amazing. I didn't get the precious oil but the extra strong hold was still pretty amazing too @influenstervox @LOrealParisUSA #elnett #contest
1589 2018-02-09 20:20:08 Homemade sunscreen: Mix coconut oil, zinc oxide, shea butter, helichrysum oil and lavender essential oil in a squeeze bottle. #essentialoils
1590 2018-02-09 20:19:43 Let me know your opinion. I’m really contemplating one but only if it really makes things crispy like oil frying does.
1591 2018-02-09 20:19:39 *gets pulled over and hands the cop a speedy oil receipt*
1592 2018-02-09 20:19:36 Clean cars are blocked by oil subsidy.
1593 2018-02-09 20:19:18 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
1594 2018-02-09 20:18:51 Approx. zero people in RI have jobs in oil and gas extraction. Workers will be flown in. No RI'der has anything close to training for those jobs. No oil companies are based here. It's fed waters. Any $$ generated 100% goes out of state. Is there any possible win for RI here?
1595 2018-02-09 20:18:46 So when is the coconut oil album coming out?
1596 2018-02-09 20:18:39 lies...
More than 90% Igbo people pronounce Oil as Oyel...
Fact
1597 2018-02-09 20:18:39 We love the way that #Elnett Precious Oil Hairspray makes our hair feel in the dry winter months! It’s perfect for an added boost to keep hair soft and smooth! @LOrealParisUSA
1598 2018-02-09 20:18:39 That’s a good example, again a place where you might have argued that a “fork” would reduce a form of market power and so should reduce firm value, but the opposite occurred. I think the explanation is more complicated than liquidity, both for Standard Oil and crypto forks.
1599 2018-02-09 20:18:30 But i dont want a New Turbo. I just want to stop burning oil. Unfortunately this isnt a perfect world. Well that will be another grand $.. #thisisgettingannoying
1600 2018-02-09 20:18:26 攻城マルチ最終回！！んんんんいい勝負でした！！gg!!
1601 2018-02-09 20:18:24 well the oil lobby is not doing that great a job or else EEast would still be a go and KM would be working.
1602 2018-02-09 20:18:18 WTI oil? What you think ... goin up?
1603 2018-02-09 20:18:16 Not a chance. They hope all the oil companies will say, f*** it and move elsewhere, then they can lift their lilly white hands that have never truly worked a hard day in their lives in the air and say "we tried". #TrudeauMustGo
1604 2018-02-09 20:18:03 @LOrealParisUSA’s brand new #Elnett Precious Oil Hairspray was formulated specially for dry and damaged hair! It has the same great staying power as the traditional #Elnett formulas, but has a touch of Argan Oil to keep locks smooth and silky!
1605 2018-02-09 20:18:03 Did rich women really pay for used gladiator oil? I think I told my kid that a few months ago.
1606 2018-02-09 20:18:03 I know its a small thing but i commend you on calling it bitumen and not oil. I think the government changing the name to make it sound cleaner lends no credibility to the commodity. Stand true and speak only the truth and your voice will be heard... or something like that.
1607 2018-02-09 20:18:00 I want folks to enjoy our beaches long after we're gone, so don't forget: The federal government is still considering Florida for offshore oil drilling. We've go to hold their feet to the fire on this until it's off the table for good.

1610 2018-02-09 20:17:54 who tryna oil my hair rn
1611 2018-02-09 20:17:53 Diubtful as it wouldn’t have enough oil suspended in the solution to spontaneously emulsify. Post photos! Cheers!
1612 2018-02-09 20:17:48 That's great news!  Now if we could just come together and work together to eliminate #capitalism, the use of #oil, industrialized #agriculture and #farming and the timber industry our environment and ecosystem may just have a chance at recovery.
1613 2018-02-09 20:17:46 Insurers can no more control the cost of health care than you can control the price of oil by using Gas Buddy. That’s true whether you are Warren Buffet or Joe Schmoe.

1618 2018-02-09 20:17:06 I’m getting my oil changed & sitting in the waiting area, surrounded by farmers and older guys wearing business suites. 

I’m over here wearing black jeans, white/black checkered @VANS_66, a rainbow @TWLOHA shirt representing the LGBTQ+ community, and my hair is blue. 

Hey 
1619 2018-02-09 20:17:02 Palm oil? People use palm oil on babies?
1620 2018-02-09 20:17:01 I pray they have the balls to do it. In 1947 the US commanded 47 percent of the world's economy. It is now 21 percent. BRICS is 25 percent. China is going to oil based exchanges. The world has gotten tired of the US and we are not smart enough to know it!
1621 2018-02-09 20:16:31 In order for us to table a clear agenda and engage the state and oil companies succesfully, we need to  have adequate credible information.#ouroilOurfuture@BunyoroOilMvt
1622 2018-02-09 20:16:24 Wij dachten hier hetzelfde, 31? Oil of Olaz groothandel opzoeken!
1623 2018-02-09 20:16:18 Reminds me of the old Standard Oil worth more after breakup than before story. Could liquidity be the answer? Crypto is very illiquid overall.
1624 2018-02-09 20:16:07 Its bwcause the oil found in catnip makes them feel a sense of euphoria! \o/ ...and are you trying to say youve eaten catnip...
1625 2018-02-09 20:15:56 It's said by a @CJTFOIR rep, and they always say nonsense like this. It's the official position of the governments they represent, it's really just a roundabout way of saying "keep the oil flowing".
1626 2018-02-09 20:15:55 Dr appt is over now at the eye appt so far so good. Then off to get my car a “physical and oil change” tomorrow dentist appt. Starting off the new year with good health.
1627 2018-02-09 20:15:55 Oil satin hair spray? please tell me more! I think hair spray i think hard and crunchy lol not oil and satin lol #Elnett
1628 2018-02-09 20:15:47 So my day was just made when I seen @_camiviera at Morgan Oil with the gas pump to her right of her car when her tanks on the left with the hose going over the car cause she still doesn’t know which side her tank is on so yeah thanks Cami
1629 2018-02-09 20:15:46 Mix 1/3 cup chicken with 4 tsps dips. Add Olive Oil. Boil. Serve warm.
1630 2018-02-09 20:15:46 Use castor oil mix with coconut oil
1631 2018-02-09 20:15:45 They have us by the short and curlies.They have the oil and money and will go elsewhere if we stand up to them.We cannot do anything else but smile through the pain.
1632 2018-02-09 20:15:39 Question: Could this toy be used with coconut oil instead of a water-based lubricant? I usually use oil instead of water-based with silicone toys, as I find it lasts longer between applications and produces a smoother glide to my sensitivities/sensibilities.
1633 2018-02-09 20:15:38 Oil crashed 11%. Gee I wonder why. Could it be...no surely they'd tell us.
1634 2018-02-09 20:15:36 Eggs- if ur baking can substitute eggs for oil
1635 2018-02-09 20:15:27 Seems odd you use Crisco oil in your hair. Hmmmm
1636 2018-02-09 20:15:19 Makeup is gorgeous but some of y’all look like you dunked your faces into a pan of oil 
1637 2018-02-09 20:15:03 Oil plunges 3.2%, settling at $59.20, posting worst weekly decline in two years #energy #oil
1638 2018-02-09 20:15:01 Particularly ironic since according to researchers from California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard the dirtiest oil in North America comes from California (Placerita oil field). #abpoli
1639 2018-02-09 20:14:54 Ouu! Precious oil, would love to try that one
1640 2018-02-09 20:14:50 no one realizes that burning #FossilFuels causes the death of millions each years.
In the early '60's, there was much talk of #fusion but large investment in oil. Now,
we have #nuclear so much safer than #FossilFuel
1641 2018-02-09 20:14:49 I agree. Pruit is the worst person to have as head of epa. That’s why trump appointed him. Oil and gas ties, sued the epa several times before. He’ll do anything to undo all the work epa has ever done. Including destroying our waters and air, evil!
1642 2018-02-09 20:14:47 Gee could it be Russian oil sales?
1643 2018-02-09 20:14:41 Yup. If this were a printed article I'd use it as a funnel for changing my oil. That's as useful as it would get.

1645 2018-02-09 20:14:38 Emergency. How many people experienced ackward troubles, since 1988, distractions, psychological abuse, that went unnoticed as think it only happened to them(!), after complaining to damage from; fosill fuels, war economy, wmd, low quality life, oil spill?

1648 2018-02-09 20:14:29 The price of oil has fallen 10%  this week, AND the stocks are having the worst week since 2008! 
But @realDonaldTrump will claim its “fake news” 
So much winning! #MAGA
1649 2018-02-09 20:14:23 I thought the terrorist came from Egypt I have always wondered why we went to war with Iraq other than Saddam not wanting to play nice with oil prices.

1655 2018-02-09 20:13:59 Instead of leave in condition I swear by the hair oil Chi puts out or basically any Aragon oil, although the Chi product has no scent.
1656 2018-02-09 20:13:58 Definitely my new favorite hairspray especially with the argan oil that is in this product, super beneficial to getting on the journey of healthy hair. Gives a great shine & hold for any hairstyle, any day. Would totally recommend it to everyone! #elnett #contest

1676 2018-02-09 20:11:12 @cathmckenna I saw you talking to Don Martin the other day and found your comments about oilfield workers to be quite offensive. You seemed to imply that they are somehow a danger to women. My father, both my brothers, my nephew, and many of my friends have worked in the oil

1689 2018-02-09 20:10:15 In fairness, addendum is probably not something you'll hear on a bus in the morning. Either the solicitor wrote that or the snake oil salesman parading as a public relations guru(they probably thought zero tolerance was a good idea too). If he plays he plays.

1717 2018-02-09 20:07:37 She said it was a new offering and they wanted people to try it out. It had 6 pieces and was pretty delicious (light crust, thin tomato-y sauce, olive oil, fresh basil, some sort of creamy white cheese drizzle, and very thin slivers of a harder cheese - I suck at cheese ID).

1739 2018-02-09 20:04:50 They should do this because it would shine the spotlight on the wide reach of the AB oil industry. That message gets lost because the eco-shills have built so many inroads into politics and the media.
1740 2018-02-09 20:04:35 What have I said that’s incorrect? Which companies drilled for the oil and the whole of the Uk benefitted. Scotland is in the Uk. If you don’t get that I can’t help you

Is Canadian oil different than Saudi or Venezuelan oil in it's effects on climate?
1758 2018-02-09 20:02:24 Germany is leading the solar engineering wave. Licensing it to China who is taking it to scale. This making it affordable. We are not only getting left behind technology wises but also economically. Oil isn’t going away anytime soon but solar will be the replacement.
1759 2018-02-09 20:02:20 So advisers recommending a balanced portfolio of stocks & bonds were selling snake oil all these years?
1760 2018-02-09 20:02:08 How often do you change your oil? You might be overdue.

1774 2018-02-09 20:00:37 In #Nigeria, imported oil products, especially automobile fuel, are government subsidized to keep prices below market. This results in much product being smuggled out to higher priced neighboring countries. Hence shortages for consumers. Internal refineries needed.

1788 2018-02-09 19:59:45 I was just wondering to myself why do I lack so much common sense, but then I thought of a memory of watching my mother pour vegetable oil down her back before going and sitting in the sun. That’s definitely it.

Obama: Strong economy
1792 2018-02-09 19:59:26 Unbelievably offensive ... as a former oil patch worker I was never put in harms way or mistreated.  I was very likely underpaid comparatively.  But their narrative is very 1970’s.

1795 2018-02-09 19:58:52 Fascinating..just learned that margin requirements on equity index futures at Interactive Brokers are higher than for crude oil and copper. Haven't seen that before..obviously thats not typical
1796 2018-02-09 19:58:35 It applies to physical #oil too. The legendary John Latsis reportedly built a huge floating storage position in mid-1986, when the crude world “was gonna end”. In mid-August that year, prices more than doubled.

1811 2018-02-09 19:57:13 Hi @MikeLynchTweets , if you read the entire post, you will see that the student recommends the company take precautions not to harm aquatic life and to invest in preventing oil leaks. Faster shipping speeds = less CO2.

1813 2018-02-09 19:56:50 @fossilgasfallan Before you ret... know what fossils are. Go learn some chemical lesons. No oil or gas are fossils.
1814 2018-02-09 19:56:39 Everyone loves to say regulations are a problem. What exactly are the problematic regulations? And be specific. I’ve never heard an oil man say “ well cuz of X regulation it prevents us from Y”. Regulations prevent us from getting raped like theb3rd world.
1815 2018-02-09 19:56:36 so my dry socket issue has not been solved. no pain meds are working, not even hydrocodone. I heard clove oil works, so I bought it. not only is it DISGUSTING, now I smell like a fucken spice rack. if anyone has any remedies I will take any recommendations.

1817 2018-02-09 19:56:33 On the surface  Notley looks petty but it’s the least menacing, most public move she could make.  BC’s dispute is with the Federal gov’t and our oil and gas sector are caught in the crossfire.  I think the people of BC should look in their own backyard. ie;Site C damage to earth
1818 2018-02-09 19:56:30 I'm just happy to have a provincial government that has a climate program and acts on it.  I fully expected conservatives to continue to govern with their heads up big oil's asses.

1832 2018-02-09 19:53:49 Wrong. I am a proponent of pipelines and responsible oil development. Worked on 4 different projects in Alberta. As well as many different oil sands projects. We differ from in the approach to get building going. @jkenney strategy is is a failure as history has proven.

1841 2018-02-09 19:52:54 U.S. weekly oil rig count up 26, largest weekly increase since 2013. Oil down 11% on the week & gasoline futures also down 20-25 cents. So when's that 20-25 cent drop at the pump going to happen? Quick to rise & slow to fall for consumers. #profitmargins

1849 2018-02-09 19:51:48 We agree. No worries... Solar energy is going to take over and the world won't need oil and gas. Just frustrating that they want to send poor kids to kill each other over obsolete resources. 

May peace find our planet
1850 2018-02-09 19:51:47 6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39.

1865 2018-02-09 19:49:57 Absolutely agree.  If it is as good as it is made out to be, you would think the private sector would jump all over it.  After watching the video and then thinking about it, I think there would be forces like the oil and gas people would NEVER want it to see the light of day.

1902 2018-02-09 19:44:05 I’d be shocked if the global market cap of crypto at ~600B could have a “significant” impact on the ~100T equity market cap.  Maybe there is a ton of leverage that would exacerbate both sides.  I can definitely see a pychological impact but that would be short lived.

1919 2018-02-09 19:41:33 1 @SecretaryZinke met on 9/14 with a former Israeli politician who just happens to have an oil/gas company that is violating international and US policy. And it get's even more convoluted, just wait...

1921 2018-02-09 19:41:33 U.S. crude oil fell below $59 a barrel for the first time in 2018, on pace for the worst weekly drop in two years. ~ CNBC

1923 2018-02-09 19:41:03 So, since #fossilfuel extraction in the Amazon has such a huge impact on #climatechange (not to mention the biodiversity and human rights impacts), large-scale users of those fossil fuels play a key role in reducing the deforestation and GHG emissions caused by Amazon oil. 3/
1924 2018-02-09 19:41:00 Anyway..I was not expecting 59 to break today..just 60..so the bloodbath to 58.07 confirmed the fragile nature of oil at these levels.
1925 2018-02-09 19:40:59 Scorecard has Trump slightly ahead in high ground here. Who didn't collude or attempt to?
1926 2018-02-09 19:40:45 Sending bitumen to our coasts to ship overseas will not replace one liter of imported oil. It will certainly produce dilbit spills on land and in the ocean. Once the price of dilbit gets low enough, the companies will abscond leaving all Canadians with messes that cost trillions.

1928 2018-02-09 19:40:33 And make sure we drove off the coast of California. The more oil goes down in price the more it hurts Iran and Saudi Arabia

1930 2018-02-09 19:40:17 I mean ... I don’t eat nuts or seeds and I’m completely healthy. Nor do I use coconut oil. Many foods don’t naturally have b12 anymore so even many non vegans should be taking b12 if their levels are not normal. My sister is vegan and her b12 is high. It all depends.

1950 2018-02-09 19:37:32 Okay after experimenting, jojoba oil and apricot oil are the combo! My skin is glowing and flourishing!
1951 2018-02-09 19:37:28 I'm in Alberta, where our economy is heavily reliant on oil prices *and* we are trying to diversify our energy sector at the same time. For example, we added the carbon tax to help fund greener projects. We are closing down our coal power plants. But we still need revenue...
1952 2018-02-09 19:37:17 Cramer please be bullish oil. This is like The Gartman signal
1953 2018-02-09 19:37:14 Please stop encouraging these war hungry horrible Americans from bombing other countries and killing people by buying into their bullshit. It’s about US/Israel and BLACK GOLD aka oil.
1954 2018-02-09 19:37:14 @TheSoulbrother If use use Publix dough, try it on shallow roasting sheet pan with a drizzle of evoo on the pan. Work  the dough out to the edges of the pan with your fingertips and top with your favs. Cook in a hot oven, the oil on the pan will brown the bottom nicely.
1955 2018-02-09 19:36:56 I'm definitely in the egg camp. Can't beat it. And chilli oil. Not pineapple tho. Yuk

1961 2018-02-09 19:36:13 Thanks for the engagement. It's true that oil and gas isn't the only cause of deforestation and human rights abuses in the Amazon. But we never say it's the only one, and the fact is that it is a big driver, especially in the Western Amazon. 1/

1969 2018-02-09 19:34:43 The reason those deer are in urban areas is due to loss of habitat from the oil and gas industry.   Numerous scientific studies have proven that is the primary cause of decline in mule deer populations.  But, you hate science, right?

2034 2018-02-09 19:28:43 The grocery stores were against banning plastic bags until govt said they could keep the 10 cent fee. Maybe oil companies feel they won't incur the wrath of govt if they don't fight the climate change religion.

2056 2018-02-09 19:26:23 Not giving them away to oil and gas exploration is at the top of my list!!
2057 2018-02-09 19:26:20 Seriously?? The environmentalists are concerned about this? Most of the environmental groups funding is coming from foreign sources in an effort to keep our oil landlocked. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
2058 2018-02-09 19:26:08 I had to ask three Wal Mart employees in Dallas where I could find the motor oil before I found one who spoke English.

2060 2018-02-09 19:25:49 It is still funny every time that I top off the windshield washer fluid or check my oil, that I still get those weird looks from guys.

2070 2018-02-09 19:24:45 While I understand your frustration, I will say that, as a student at a Uni funded heavily by big oil, it does have detrimental effects on the direction of the institution. UNB has been making soft polytechnic moves for a long time, it's killing the Uni. Not acceptable.
2071 2018-02-09 19:24:40 Oil?
2072 2018-02-09 19:24:38 Anyone involved with them in a high level ‘i think they are great’ kinda way, should be flown into the middle of the Pacific and chucked out the plane naked and covered in fish oil. 

Recycle them.
2073 2018-02-09 19:24:25 For oil investors, remember the reason the interest rise are the very reasons why oil price rises, a hot economy spurring inflation due to imballance in supply and demand.  We are seeing the demand side but the glut has hidden the impact.  The glut is gone, despite seasonality 1/
2074 2018-02-09 19:24:23 Enough talk about Rothschild and Rockefeller, families etc,,,,these where the old powers,,, long gone,,. I wonder who is really pulling the strings today... I doubt it's any of the old oil and banking giants of the past,, once the king has passed it's a fight for the throne, ;)
2075 2018-02-09 19:24:20 Lol its legit oil fam,, it’s scary what those oaks allow
2076 2018-02-09 19:24:20 It's like running in the new block/ piston at increasing speeds , and then leaving it in an oil bath.

2078 2018-02-09 19:23:57 Ok. I speak American and you speak English (oil/petrol, chicks/birds, flavor/flavour, collective plural/singular etc.). So what is “s.n”? Shittin’ (like our fuckin’)? Or is it a Northern term? I’m truly interested to learn the answer.

2089 2018-02-09 19:22:34 And adds to our deficit. It was irresponsible and unnecessary to pass that #GOPTaxBillScam.  All for your BIG OIL DONORS. Resign!
2090 2018-02-09 19:22:31 I just found out that tea tree oil is toxic to dogs. WOW. I had no idea and I use it all the time.
2091 2018-02-09 19:22:25 I ain’t no oil painting, both are out of my league 
2092 2018-02-09 19:22:13 By not supporting responsible Alberta oil moving oil to new markets allows irresponsible and environmentally unfriendly producers to thrive. How does that make sense.
2093 2018-02-09 19:22:13 Nice to hear from a disciple of the old snake oil sales supremo Mr Farage.....blame the immigrants who staff NHS...agriculture..and fisheries..so which laws need changing? Apart from tax evasion...off shore banking..hit the Mays and Rees Moggs wherever hurts eh?

2096 2018-02-09 19:21:39 My skin at first (2-3 months) broke out so bad it was unreal. Like I’ll send you pics. But when I started to pair it with the oil it cleared. Why does our skin have to be so picky

2114 2018-02-09 19:19:16 So your argument is oil is going to pump from Alberta right into the ocean. Great arguement and logical thinking.
2115 2018-02-09 19:19:13 State of Louisiana loved intracoastal as it supported off shore drilling

For decades the Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana has provided highway for many global companies as they supported Louisiana oil industry
Army Corps U.S. taxpayers funded support of oil industry.
2116 2018-02-09 19:18:37 Oil just killed inflation
2117 2018-02-09 19:18:31 Every time I see or hear of you, I think of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who are now dead because of the illegal war you helped Tony Bliar launch against them - destabilising the Middle East in the process. All in the name of oil. Shame on you.
2118 2018-02-09 19:18:24 Got to get a oil change tomorrow wooo. If I can get one.
2119 2018-02-09 19:17:51 I got enough with oil and currencies...Im not smart enough to trade more than 3 things at a time
2120 2018-02-09 19:17:50 omg it's like "oh yeah we can change your oil BUT HERE'S ALL THIS OTHER STUFF?" and it's like well now I have to fix all that shit so yeah go ahead and next thing ya know ya bank account is dead
2121 2018-02-09 19:17:45 Hey lil Donnie......if you really want to create jobs, pssst, check “green jobs” it’s our future.....not oil, coal & military.
2122 2018-02-09 19:17:41 Inflation is on the horizon.  In the past investors have found refuge from inflation in commodities, i.e. gold or oil.  Will we find an inverse relation with inflation and BTC?
2123 2018-02-09 19:17:16 Oil change..then a lil washy washy for my baby!!
2124 2018-02-09 19:17:08 Great for homemade mayo. Regular olive oil is too strong.

2126 2018-02-09 19:16:52 If you own equities/bonds/crypto and real losses or margin calls on crytos comes in, how you going to cover? Sell equities.
2127 2018-02-09 19:16:41 "Good" projects .. give me a break.  You are there as a one-stop path to "NO" if you are an oil/gas exploration or extraction project.  Why not be truthful and say so. The flight of investment $$$s will be keenly felt by the West.
2128 2018-02-09 19:16:40 Yep, right out of the new GOP hand book:
1. Deny
2. Blame Hillary and/or the DEMS.
3. Put up an oil well.
4. Repeat.
2129 2018-02-09 19:16:30 cool. (side note) I can't believe it but I still have some oil paint handed down to me from my mom, that I still use. 
weird.
It's like 48 years old, and still good.
Hard to get the lid off tho.
2130 2018-02-09 19:16:29 i hate putting oil in my car i do not have a steady hand shit be goin everywhere

2132 2018-02-09 19:16:20 I know, but I guess like they say oil field never sleeps so. Got to make money some how.
2133 2018-02-09 19:16:11 ~ that attention grabbing layer of oil probably keeps him warm… and us hot.
2134 2018-02-09 19:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but welfare use will decrease.
2135 2018-02-09 19:16:02 Usual exercise class was cancelled so I've been to the gym. Burnt 777 calories, now have coconut oil in my hair, a choc orange facemask and a rhubarb gin and lemonade  #pampered
2136 2018-02-09 19:15:51 Right, exactly the point, we should see the Government as a positive force, and then these scammers and snake oil sales people wouldn't feel its easy and their right to take the government for all its got. They are taking from people, not the government.

2141 2018-02-09 19:15:20 We don't do trust busting anymore. In fact, we give those megacorps money when they bankrupt themselves. Nobody remembers or gets taught about Standard Oil anymore.
2142 2018-02-09 19:15:17 I love when I'm getting an oil change and they find like 12 other things wrong with my car lmao rip me
2143 2018-02-09 19:15:07 that lays down several light, even layers of carbon on the iron. that gives you a more smooth surface with better release ability than one thick layer of oil cooked off. but you want it HOT and you want to see black smoke
2144 2018-02-09 19:15:04 Castor oil on your lashes every night before bed really does WONDERS.
2145 2018-02-09 19:14:45 Limitless money supply/ capital at any given point in time?

Any cross ownership?
2146 2018-02-09 19:14:45 any of yall know of like herbs that are healthy that i could infuse into coco oil (not a joke abt weed im serious)
2147 2018-02-09 19:14:43 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
2148 2018-02-09 19:14:36 He did these when naija was selling a barrel of crude oil for $100. Facts only!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2149 2018-02-09 19:14:28 Of course, we can discount Norway, Luxembourg, and Switzerland due to their unique economic niches, namely North Sea oil and banking/finance havens.

2159 2018-02-09 19:13:13 This will do more for global GHG than a carbon tax and obstructionism that lets dirtier producers sell oil to countries like Canada. How much did Canada spend on oil imports in December? 3 billion. @cathmckenna @ec_minister
2160 2018-02-09 19:13:12 I just randomly thought about when i was little, my mother used to make us take cod liver oil every single night.  Lol. DISGUSTING. But we were probably the healthiest lil niggas back then
2161 2018-02-09 19:13:01 Speaking of - I put oil paint on a canvas today. I've had a mixed media / assemblage thing in my head that will NOT go away. Not quitting jewelry, but I have a lot of craft stuff sitting around.
2162 2018-02-09 19:12:57 1) There is only 2 million barrels a day of heavy oil refining capacity on the Gulf coast. 2) Up until 2015 the Americans had a ban on exporting crude. They could only export finished products.3) Upgraded tar sands oil has been transported to Ontario refineries since the 1970s.
2163 2018-02-09 19:12:54 All they do is try to throw money at natives for their land, and when they're refused, they take with force, only to pollute it with uranium, oil and fracking bullshit. The earth is sacred and it's being destroyed because of the federally biased corporate bullying aforementioned.
2164 2018-02-09 19:12:52 Anyway my dad is now telling me to do keto and take whatever the hell CBT oil is instead of my meds and I’m screaming and want to plunge myself into the depths of the ocean
2165 2018-02-09 19:12:36 The decision to go to war with Iraq was a mistake. George W walked into office with a chip on his shoulder for Iraq. 9/11 was his reason. Truth be known the real reason for war in Iraq was the fact that Saddam demanded payment for Iraqi oil in Euros as opposed to US Dollars.
2166 2018-02-09 19:12:25 The OIL.

2187 2018-02-09 19:09:59 Yeah, that is just "giving free stuff" to buy Democrats votes. GOP only aides the wealthy with big tax cuts & subsidies to big business like $37.5 BILLION/ year to big oil.

2190 2018-02-09 19:09:45 They had Tikrit, claims and parts of Mosul, and a lot of the oil bearing areas of Iraq, and protected autonomy, and they blew it. I sympathize. But...they still retain Erbil and the oil bearing areas around that, which is not nothing

2192 2018-02-09 19:09:11 Not too close, I like him but baby oil stains don’t get out of clothes
2193 2018-02-09 19:09:03 Please start telling the truth and not skewing the the truth. The market is at least 30% higher than it should be. Oil prices wouldn’t even be a bargain if cut in half. Anything else is brainwashing and P.R.
2194 2018-02-09 19:08:57 Another big jump in the rig count this week. Oil rigs +29. Permian is +40, ~10%, in the last six weeks. More than it added in the whole second half of 2017. Going to be another big year for W Texas supply. #OOTT
2195 2018-02-09 19:08:51 @JustinTrudeau Saw your response to Elizabeth May in Parliament.  We're just going to have to decouple a carbon tax and oceanic protection from the pipeline issue for you.  Sorry if it ruins any deal you had with the oil industry, but the climate can't wait.  #stopKM
2196 2018-02-09 19:08:48 El Juez Javier Cosentino, subrogante del Juzgado en lo Comercial 5, aceptó la apertura del concurso preventivo de Oil Combustibles.
2197 2018-02-09 19:08:45 yes yesss
2198 2018-02-09 19:08:35 OIL
2199 2018-02-09 19:08:32 Sure. Must be also used for drive-thru purposes.  If single use : or edible or biodegr veget. oil (in case it changes into litter)?
2200 2018-02-09 19:08:30 + we certainly should be doing much more to make amends in the countries affected by our foreign policies. But then the incursions into Libya, Iraq, etc have all been about exploitation of resources like oil, rather than any ethical policy...
2201 2018-02-09 19:08:28 I may bring along a nice big bottle of Cod liver oil too, keep all you #Littles healthy & regular #bowels 
2202 2018-02-09 19:08:24 They will use any arbitrary measure to decline the application for oil/gas exploration or expansion.  Like NEP forcing TCP to account for upstream and downstream emissions killed Energy East, too many men in remote town with women will sound death nell of many new proposals.
2203 2018-02-09 19:08:17 @AndrewBellBNN Eric Nutall soo serious... it hasn't been easy for anyone in oil these last years and again these last months, seems to have worsened
2204 2018-02-09 19:08:06 .Working hard to warp the world for future generations. Doing anything to save Canada from these ideologues is almost out of my generation’s control,  hopefully  young folks following will learn to intuitively recognize snake oil salesmen (people, whatever) for what they are.

2208 2018-02-09 19:07:18 You people have been engulfed by what these men of God say rather than the scriptures or God.

2209 2018-02-09 19:07:15 Tonhão (Anthony)  tortilla in olive oil! But I prefer my heart of palm, JOSH, I love  ps: in Portuguese it gets better HAHAHAHAHAHAH
2210 2018-02-09 19:07:08 Budget deal wasn't nearly as bad as some people say. $300M in stimulus is needed plus small tax on oil is back. Dems, keeping that in mind, should have taken a more hardline stance with DACA. The Dreamers need help badly.
2211 2018-02-09 19:07:05 OIL PAINTING HAAAAAARD

2214 2018-02-09 19:06:41 Also, British govt is aiding and abetting the vast educational gap b/t North and South for economic interests alone rather than 4 the common good.  North would be totally lost on managing oil resources w/o UK.

2225 2018-02-09 19:04:32 Had a presentation for communications class today. It went really well! Thank goodness! 

However, I realized only now that my egg breakfast splattered oil all over my shirt... So my appearance was... less than professional... 
2226 2018-02-09 19:04:26 So gung ho to attack Alberta oil yet have no interest in attacking the largest polluters.
2227 2018-02-09 19:04:18 Here's a compromise: let's ship the oil to a refinery in BC. But that's not what the American-owned company wants. It desires American profits over the safety of BC waters and Canadian jobs.

2233 2018-02-09 19:03:45 Use amla oil! My mama uses it and she loves it. It grew her hair about an 2 inches in 2 months. You can get it on amazon or a an Indian store for about $5-$6. It’s a pretty big bottle too. She is going to send me some.
2234 2018-02-09 19:03:33 i splashed hot olive oil into my cornea when i was frying an egg this morning so yeah, i feel you
2235 2018-02-09 19:03:29 I’m Italian-American and never saw cheese on a pizza until middle school. I was appalled. My entire Italian-born family made pizza with handmade dough, home grown tomatoes, onion and basil–and olive oil.
2236 2018-02-09 19:03:29 I got a professional massage which is great but I’m so fucked up he went 15 mins over (for free) which is great BUT now I’m covered in massage oil and don’t have time to shower before work. How much of this can I get out of my hair with baby wipes?? Stay tuned
2237 2018-02-09 19:03:27 True. It is sad that no one is addressing the consequences of a tanker  accident. A bitumen accident will be a disaster for decades and be the ruin of sea life on the coast. Bitumen is much worse than refined oil.
2238 2018-02-09 19:03:22 But not with a European Union  money is the root of all conflicts the house of saud funded al queda taliban and isis no one did anything about it because of oil

2242 2018-02-09 19:02:40 Sitting in Big O tires getting an oil change and waiting in this small room.  Meanwhile there is a terrible tv show on and this one lady is just dying of laughter and everyone else is completely silent 
2243 2018-02-09 19:02:40 Most of these "big" Toyota service centres in Lagos will use 20W50 mineral oil for your car. Just when you thought they are so advanced...
Use manufacturer's specified lubricants please.
2244 2018-02-09 19:02:29 If you get hit by a car you and your family suffer. If the coast gets hit by an oil spill...I'll let you do the math.
2245 2018-02-09 19:02:22 Start robbing it with total oil and thank me later ... Nothing one won’t see on twitter, rada rada rede rede.
2246 2018-02-09 19:02:18 Which oil?
2247 2018-02-09 19:02:17 #Canadian translation of what @JustinTrudeau really means: go F*** yourself #BC & #Canada #environment. Big oil (& their "donations") matters far more than investing in retraining #Canadians to  work with clean #energy alternates that position us into a lucrative #future.
2248 2018-02-09 19:02:16 Oil change got my daughter acting like a bad bitch, I stan.

2251 2018-02-09 19:02:07 The idea of striking oil off the Dorset coast is also attractive, because it's an easy way out of a trade off.

2255 2018-02-09 19:01:39 It’s not hindsight, they all told Bush at the time we needed to focus on Afghanistan, it’s why it was so hard to get approval for Iraq.  Bush went after the oil in Iraq & used the attack as an excuse.  Everyone knew where the terrorists were, & it wasn’t Iraq
2256 2018-02-09 19:01:33 Oil has been acting as an alternative risk asset as everything else got pricey before the risk selloff. It rallied last, so to speak. But the price spike had a real world impact on production, and overshot fundamentals (demand was up, but as much as price indicated).
2257 2018-02-09 19:01:15 Of course my car has an oil leak  bad timing Leo, damn it.
2258 2018-02-09 19:01:07 Stay out of California waters. No oil drillers or added pollution!!!!  Better yet, stay away from California period.

2276 2018-02-09 18:59:16 @realDonaldTrump Mister President ! Please stop buying Venezuelan oil! Vzla is a narco dictatorship. There is corruption, there are many political prisoners + many people dead, who protested against this government. There is hunger, there is a lack of medicines, it`s very urgent!

2279 2018-02-09 18:58:15 @marketcall @AndrewBellBNN an analyst report Feb 7th forecast $57 oil and OPEC turning on the taps. If correct, would this undermine your positive view on Canadian oil?
2280 2018-02-09 18:57:48 Interesting point that nobody is acknowledging - does this indicate that further drops in equities on account of raising rates are still to be expected if rates continue to rise? Btw - good call on oil.
2281 2018-02-09 18:57:30 Oregano oil is amazing to clear off throat discomfort , fever , cold

2301 2018-02-09 18:54:25 Oil crumbles on fears of surging US production Drillers jump
For the second week in a row, the number of US oil rigs surged. It's a sign that shale production could be about to explode again.
Also this week, US oil production jumped more than 300K bpd to 10.2 million barrels…
2302 2018-02-09 18:54:16 You are damn right, as a first world country we should stick to kill innocent people and plunder poor countries for stupid reasons or oil, not show them the tools.

2339 2018-02-09 18:50:32 Also...the source of the article is very relevant. And so is knowing who actually paid for the “research.” Tobacco, dairy, alcohol, oil etc have all paid for research to put themselves in the best light
2340 2018-02-09 18:50:30 Ah, so Kelly, the GOP has all the answers ? Great Recession mean anything to you ? Roll back into the 1950’s in America thanks to the GOP right now? A 25 year OIL war that is still continuing in the Middle East ? Don’t throw stones at glass houses.
2341 2018-02-09 18:50:29 Got a wax, car wash & oil change before 10am and now i need to nap for 6hrs.
2342 2018-02-09 18:50:21 lots of tea tree oil and just washed it a lot, i held the saline to it with a cotton ball every day and i was using a tea tree face wash so that probably helped too! i used antibacterial stuff as well & made sure it was always dry after cleaning so more bacteria couldn’t grow

2440 2018-02-09 18:38:53 True, even if they're not as dependent on oil as Nigeria. Don't they have about $1 trillion in SWF which allowed them deal with the shock better? And at a time their GDP growth was around 0.5% for a particular quarter in 2016 I think.

2457 2018-02-09 18:36:14 Why the petrol and diesel prizes are so high.....? While crude oil is available at comparetivly affordable prize in internation market....

2458 2018-02-09 18:36:02 Better for who?  Better for the US, the military industrial complex and other US (particularly oil/resource) corporations . . . all of them!
2459 2018-02-09 18:35:54 *looks at deets* "from power plants and industrial facilities for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) and other forms of geologic storage and for beneficial uses of CO2" Yeah, nah. Wrong focus entirely relative to long-term need.
2460 2018-02-09 18:35:52 Meh, it follows the stock market and when treasuries rally-dollar rallies and oil breaks
2461 2018-02-09 18:35:36 Perhaps the oil industry in Nigeria should be completely shut down and the economy built on other natural resources.  My understanding is the North would be for their own independence also if not for guaranteed resource control via indirect rule?  True?
2462 2018-02-09 18:35:22 あと面白いのはあの手のオイルは全体的にMade in USAや星条旗を表に出して事が多い傾向があるんですよね。どの層を騙そうとしてるか非常に分かりやすく、その層が騙しやすいと思われているのも案の定というか。

2472 2018-02-09 18:34:17 if you affiliate yourself with those freaks of nature and so called “young cum bitches” known as teenie beenie and a is for oil then don’t even think about walking 20 feet infront of or behind me because honey i’m locked and loeaded and ready to fucking blow lil mama
2473 2018-02-09 18:34:05 Why he gotta oil himself up though? @BrittS46
2474 2018-02-09 18:34:04 I think negative correlation holds if oil price is being supported by leverage at upper bound 'seller's market'. When market is over-supplied/collapsing then correlation may turn positive. ie oil & dollar fall together until clearing Buyer's Market level is reached
2475 2018-02-09 18:34:03 If you want to see where the economy is REALLY going, just look at an oil chart.

2477 2018-02-09 18:33:54 And while we talk about spending answer me this. Can’t afford Sanchez but can afford Mahrez? Ive worked in Oil and Gas for years and switched to Renewables when the oil prices collapsed. Abu Dhabi will be fucked soon and so will City

2479 2018-02-09 18:33:52 This week I've bought gym clothes and an essential oil diffuser. I am living my best adult life.

2482 2018-02-09 18:33:31 Fed - central bank... has a lot to do with why the US government is at war with the world. Oil and gas are bankable industries and the US economy depend on them. Corporate lobby/law firm Sullivan & Cromwell & their clients created the Fed.
2483 2018-02-09 18:33:30 You ever get the feeling GS (Goldman) trading oil against their clients? They can’t be this bad! #OOTT #WTI #Brent

2485 2018-02-09 18:33:16 The fighting in North and West Syria is all about control of the gas pipeline in the east and the oil fields in the west. US using the rebels and Kurds to hold the ground with 82nd Airborne.
2486 2018-02-09 18:33:12 Best thing I ever did was quit working for a major oil company & start my own business. Less money sure, but no commute, less politics, more family time & me time. Also earned more from crypto returns in past 6 months than my old salary. Dreams can come true.
2487 2018-02-09 18:32:54 What is Olive oil mayonnaise?

2489 2018-02-09 18:32:47 Pick any major oil company website about climate change. They admit they know they contribute to rising global temperatures and they are committed to doing their part so long as it doesn’t hurt their profits. They only admit this now because they were caught lying.

2498 2018-02-09 18:32:02 It says something when a countries people prefer a murderous tyrant to the US. Another war for oil where there can be no result because an exit strategy was never considered. Crazy.

I don’t understand
2502 2018-02-09 18:31:45 タチが悪いのは表記がシッカリしているのに廃油同然というオイルですね。流石にドーナツが付いてる場合のクソオイル率は少ないのでドーナツの重要度合いは国内以上という感じでしょうか。国内だとついているのに越したことはない的な感じもありますし。

the YPG dont do deals with ISIS, cease fires maybe.
 i think your thinking of turkey, 
erdogans son made millions trading oil with ISIS for years
2512 2018-02-09 18:30:30 Always the same with oil companies. Never slow putting prices up. But drag theire heels  when costs come down. Pure Greed.

2525 2018-02-09 18:29:12 Tryna cop some oil asap
2526 2018-02-09 18:29:12 So I’m here at the oil change place and like they literally just took my car and started doing stuff with it. Didn’t even ask me what I needed done or anything. There’s not receptionist and I’m here like.. da fuq?
2527 2018-02-09 18:29:02 Go in to get a oil change and see what’s wrong with my brakes. These fools come back talking about everything else except what I need done. Ain’t nobody got time for that.
2528 2018-02-09 18:28:59 It’s delicious, fior di latte, basil, tomato and olive oil. Give it a go next time.

2535 2018-02-09 18:28:24 Try using a non pore clogging oil to moisturise..  I use grapeseed oil but I have oily skin so I'm not sure how it is on dry skin but it should seal in moisture
2536 2018-02-09 18:28:15 Putin needs fossil fuels to have a stable price. Trump and the Greedy Old Pirates are doing all they can to help prop it up. The 500 Billion ExxonMobil oil deal depends upon it. Follow the money!
2537 2018-02-09 18:28:14 In the next oceans 11 movie they should shut down an oil pipeline instead of robbing a casino.

2540 2018-02-09 18:27:49 When equities reached correction yesterday, there was a minimum of teeth gnashing. After all, it had to be the most anticipated correction since 2000. So other risk assets moderated a bit, and sovereign bonds didn't jump much. Today may end quite differently. Watch the oil close.
2541 2018-02-09 18:27:40 Funds war & terrorism is an act of geopolitically supporting American interests. Do you know how Al Qaeda helps us fight Soviets, when Soviets where looking for oil?

2562 2018-02-09 18:25:44 They were also surprised to learn that some companies do not label sustainable palm oil purposefully. Very complex stuff.
2563 2018-02-09 18:25:32 We won't know, or we can't follow the task to completion if we get too mangled by Trump's distractions. Remember, this is not the only CA issue. He attempts poisoning our shores with Oil business he tries to promote. We need to stick to our State Representatives & encourage them.
2564 2018-02-09 18:25:24 I know health is more important. But such a similar situation, between big oil not allowing hydro electric engines, and big pharma, suppressing cures for deadly disease. Burn in hell, all those who suppress cures, and take the lives of our loved ones.

2571 2018-02-09 18:24:38 So oil money is not enough? Another method of collecting money that will end up being looted or hidden in boxes in a flat.
2572 2018-02-09 18:24:34 well,,most important thing is be patient..enjoy the journey..money always comes to those who wait....watch some HBO/netflix ..and of course expose the narrative peddlers:)

2574 2018-02-09 18:24:24 @girlscouts love them cookies, but don’t love the ingredients list including the leading cause of rainforest destruction, palm oil. #palmoil #savetherainforest #stopdeforestation #climatechange #palebluedot
2575 2018-02-09 18:24:21 日本では考えられないレベルで流通してるみたいでどっから流れてるか考えると面白いというかなんというか。汚染状態から考慮すると相当廃油経由なのが多そうなんですよね。件の画像なんてまだマシで5-30とは書いてますが5w-30とは一切書いておらず、更にはAPIもないという騙す満々なオイルなので。
2576 2018-02-09 18:24:12 Hey @girlscouts! Huge fan of your cookies  A colleague pointed out that the ingredients include palm kernel/oil. 

Given all the negative externalities, it would be great if that could be substituted out! Happy to provide more info if needed.

PDP is even worst. 16 years in governance and nothing but corruption, deceit and poor management of resources despite the oil boom during their tenure.
2580 2018-02-09 18:23:38 The point is that there are certain people who want oil sands mothballed, and no AB oil is too much oil. For those, you can make concessions, but it wont be enough.
2581 2018-02-09 18:23:37 All oil driller and energy stocks are trading at 5 years low.. Watch these stocks.

2583 2018-02-09 18:23:22 I eat meat because moderated meat intake with tons of veggies is the most ecologically responsible and  sustainable diet for the current human population. We avoid palm oil and certain stressed fish species.

2587 2018-02-09 18:23:02 it’s all about making sure the oil is at the right temp for a corn to pop as it hits the pot. Put one in the pot, and as soon as it pops, add the rest.
Then keep shaking the pot to make sure no corn stays above the popped ones haha 
Also, make sure the flame is at the lowest

2590 2018-02-09 18:22:44 Industrial production sank at the end of last year, but economists were quick to point out that the plunge was entirely due to the shutdown of the North Sea Forties oil pipeline

2592 2018-02-09 18:22:34 I'm going to guess Sinclair oil is a synthetic, but the direct fossil fuel reference in their logo is just too funny!

2595 2018-02-09 18:22:09 The Murican "solution" for the israhelli attempted theft of the Lebanese oil is: Lebanon has to choose either the oil or Hezbollah.

2597 2018-02-09 18:21:37 I don’t get why so many voters still prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt. He is clearly pro oil and continues to push for pipelines. He’s not ‘playing it out’ knowing it won’t get built.
2598 2018-02-09 18:21:35 I appreciate your civility. I agree there are risks, but there are benefits too. And the oil will go out of AB, pipeline seems the most effective and least damaging when you consider the alternatives. Canada needs to start acting as a country.
2599 2018-02-09 18:21:31 Wow they are surely the dominant source thru out the world. Make America Great Again may soon replace some of that especially if we continue to supply oil to the rest of world.

2604 2018-02-09 18:20:41 My 11 yr old daughter got a failing grade on her science project at BASIS school b/c she gathered facts from NASA that contradict Global warming and the lefty teacher said all her sources were funded by big oil. Teacher wouldn’t even discuss the data, just failed her
2605 2018-02-09 18:20:38 I don't know what "Economical" pressure on Damascus western experts are talking about, Damascus got crossing with Idlib, Euphrates Shield and SDF areas, u can ship money and all kind of goods including oil to any part of Syria today

2608 2018-02-09 18:20:31 Any #OOTTMoron s want to push more false bullish narratives like "OMG US exports!" or "wow pipeline blew up" or "US oil production isn't real because (insert meaningless word salad here)" or "comparative inventories" etc? #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
2609 2018-02-09 18:20:16 @SecretaryPerry Why have you excluded Florida coast from oil drilling? You now have WA & Calif filing lawsuits against the government. Energy is every States concern & none should be exempt. Poor judgement on your part.
2610 2018-02-09 18:20:15 Oil is simple.  Last thing to hold up and was record long speculator ownership.  The bullish narratives didn’t disappear or were never real.  I vote the former.  #OOTT
2611 2018-02-09 18:20:12 Saying that, after signing a silly piece of paper, Lebanon is an oil country is like saying you're not a virgin anymore after watching your first porn movie!

2613 2018-02-09 18:19:42 To me what's going in the market is squeeze of market consensus positions , long oil, long equity, long curve flattener and short $ to name a few
2614 2018-02-09 18:19:26 I was raised in the oil patch. It's no more dangerous than say, Hollywood.
2615 2018-02-09 18:19:26 It saddens me that the target here is @elonmusk and not the state governance in OK. Fortunes gained from OK resources are not adequately funding OK schools. This is much like continuing to protect the oil industry while targeting someone whose success is building a greener future
2616 2018-02-09 18:19:25 It's healthier by way of not using oil to fry, and you can do literally anything you want in it
2617 2018-02-09 18:19:19 I can’t wait to put an oil rig out there!  MAGA time!  Suck it libs!!  #PA18
2618 2018-02-09 18:19:16 You're preaching to the choir here.  I wish AB's economy had divested from fossil fuels decades ago, and the oil sands had been left in place.  My best options are voting with my money, and for political parties that value science over profit.

2628 2018-02-09 18:18:27 Oil companies SHOULDN'T drill offshore PERIOD.
2629 2018-02-09 18:18:26 today I am grateful to have a brother who changed my rotors and brake pads and who regularly does my oil changes  @TurnerMcAlister

2631 2018-02-09 18:18:11 Holy oil bust coming.
2632 2018-02-09 18:18:08 Coconut oil in hair in the winter is so annoying. One minute it’s soft & luxurious the next minute it’s as stiff as a board
2633 2018-02-09 18:17:53 It was mandatory my first yr at work, since I was performing nasal flu swabs....  yeah, it wasn’t pretty.... my entire arm looked like I dipped it in oil.... but I never have to get the shot in a medical setting again

2635 2018-02-09 18:17:42 Oil is going down with the equity ship, Jim. Not our fault! LOL
2636 2018-02-09 18:17:37 Just keep really good oil in that Ariens and it will handle it.
2637 2018-02-09 18:17:36 Making dinner - I was away with work earlier this week & couldn’t stick to my diet...so having steamed veg with avocado oil to make up for it - our electric steamer has been used a lot since my dx - what’s your favourite kitchen gadget
2638 2018-02-09 18:17:33 Perhaps they discovered oil under the pitch, when they were installing the Premier League Legacy sprinklers
2639 2018-02-09 18:17:26 I can’t even express how offensive I find this. My husband is many things... hardworking, responsible, kind, intelligent, educated, respectful - and also an oil patch worker.  You insinuating that his presence could make a community unsafe is breathtaking. @ec_minister
2640 2018-02-09 18:17:20 relatable. but luckily i havent had anyone use my mug to keep their used cooking oil. i hope you at least poured the oil out.
2641 2018-02-09 18:17:15  I don't like coconut oil

2642 2018-02-09 18:17:13 Can I take you picture oil fuck
2643 2018-02-09 18:17:11 Which was a huge oil deal.
2644 2018-02-09 18:16:58 So who tryna be my man and get my oil changed and fill my tank up? 
2645 2018-02-09 18:16:58 Great feature by my lovely vet Kate from @Formbyvets on @GranadaReports about palm oil on #Formby beach #seftoncoast
2646 2018-02-09 18:16:57 It'd actually be a great thing for countries near the North Pole... Like Russia. Big $$ for oil companies & real estate, opening up new waterways and land for development.

Hmmm 
2647 2018-02-09 18:16:24 Oil rose on faulty narrative pushing. It's now going to fall even more......and it wI'll be a Bull roast :)

2649 2018-02-09 18:16:19 .@bevel @walkercobrands Do you know the tops of the prime oil don’t fit and leak everywhere during travel? Second time this has happened, you should fix that.
2650 2018-02-09 18:16:16 Venezuela is pegged to the dollar. It’s only industry is oil. UK is not pegged — creates its own fiat currency.Venezuela in debt to China/ US . Can’t pay it in their own currency. Add drought/ corruption/ import economy to that and poor policy.

2653 2018-02-09 18:15:59 Absolutely, we discussed how to find out which companies use/which products contain sustainably sourced oil (not many), and what it means to live sustainably more broadly.
2654 2018-02-09 18:15:54 America is basically an oil company with an one trillion dollar funded army. Who can match that?
For this budget America is looted empty. Ppl pay huge premiums what Obama regime called affordable (poor) healthcare. Infrastructure collapsing. Even Zimbabwe has better roads trains
2655 2018-02-09 18:15:49 How much is it already costing the shipping industry, or rail lines to transport bitumen elsewhere? Why not distill our own product for military consumers. The oil and gas industry support all green energy initiatives. It's all about balance in energy to ensure sustainable supply
2656 2018-02-09 18:15:29 This is all about fossil fuels.  Energy In Depth is an org set up by fossil fuel companies to defend them against lawsuits.  You get led around by the nose by Fox and oil company PR, but in the end it's all about oil company profits and stock prices.
2657 2018-02-09 18:15:28 Carter Page met with Roseneft, Russian state owned oil giant, sanction lifting was discussed.

Kremlin targeted US swing state voters in cyber attacks on US democracy.

Trump ties to Putin linked businessmen who pushed the meeting with Kremlin lawyer who offers Clinton dirt.
2658 2018-02-09 18:15:26 The US has grabbed the oil and will attempt to partition Syria plus use the territory as a base against both the Syrian government and Iran.

2661 2018-02-09 18:15:23 The solution is easy. Stop all oil products from being shipped to California. Energy is Americas issue not one which California chooses to ignore. The same holds true with the State of WA and Florida. The not in my backyard is not a solution.

2666 2018-02-09 18:14:48 Not necessarily. In Cornwall and the regions in general there are whole villages and towns which have oil... Also there's not much of England that is that rural really... And it's not that far between buildings

2668 2018-02-09 18:14:39 #oil is only back to November-December levels, so it maybe too early to get overexcited about correction. But IMHO it is important that without rising (not just stable!) oil prices and secular reflation story is DOA. $TLT #TheOneTrade
2669 2018-02-09 18:14:25 How about we rid ourselves of the unnecessary burdens of wealthy & corporate tax breaks, oil, big pharma & big agriculture subsidies?? Oh right because average Americans are lazy and undeserving right?

If past is prologue, then at this point it seems likely that 45Q, snuck into the spending bill, could result in a net *increase* in emissions. Not much to cheer about. #Stop45Q

2696 2018-02-09 18:11:38 It's a hot oil treatment, so be sure to warm it up before use. I like to add in Argan oil (I find this works better) use it before shampooing. It strengths and nourishes the hair.

2710 2018-02-09 18:09:53 There is a strong argument that sust palm oil is better than boycott (as the alternatives are far worse).  Companies do not always want to label sust. palm oil even if it is as it draws attention to contents. How did they cope with complexity? It can be overwhelming!

They're going to drill until oil is back at $35.

2737 2018-02-09 18:06:46 I think we have already extracted about 75% of the conventional oil from the USA lands (maybe not offshore). A little late to start trying to save the money

2775 2018-02-09 18:03:51 What does it say about a country that can be so easily taken in by a snake oil salesman? It is not just unfortunate that so many are sucked into his line, it is a reflection of our society. Those of us who see this for what it is are nevertheless still have to own and fix it.

2800 2018-02-09 18:01:47 That’s DEFINITELY NOT something I can subscribe to. The majority of the projects claiming to add privacy are snake oil at best, purposely broken at worst. They have to repeatedly be called out, lest someone trust their freedom or even their lives to something broken.

2868 2018-02-09 17:56:53 What is the "mainstream scientific consensus?" and define "most oil company scientists."  Both very vague terms.
2869 2018-02-09 17:56:48 Anyone who conceived this thought and say it out deserves to be skinned alive and put in hot oil,  he is not a human being,  he is more wicked than the devil
2870 2018-02-09 17:56:48 I wanted to see if I could add some extra fats to my white rice. I ended up boiling the water with a bit of vegetable oil and it just needs to be masked with another flavor and then it doesn't taste too bad. 
2871 2018-02-09 17:56:44 Today’s journey. We went to an organic farm.... they made wine and olive oil and let us “sample” a lot.

2874 2018-02-09 17:56:39 You talking unflushed toilet comparing Gaddafi with scumbags, learn real facts Gaddafi was killed so America,  France and their NATO allies could milk his country oil he was standing in their way. Look at what is happening will slave trade and no NATO intervention
2875 2018-02-09 17:56:37 Coffee is now grown in more than 70 countries and is the second most commonly traded commodity in the world after oil. by #qikipedia
2876 2018-02-09 17:56:36 A spray on mask, hair cleansing oil and next level dry shampoo - @IGK_HAIR is a brilliant example of branching out from traditional hair formulations. Love it - who's tried it?
2877 2018-02-09 17:56:33 thank you for the informations. we here in saudi arabia were using virgin olive oil for cooking and mustard oil in India. 
2878 2018-02-09 17:56:32 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2879 2018-02-09 17:56:29 Its so weird how many people would prefer oil arive on tankers from contries with way worse safety and environmental records than us rather than use a pipeline of our own oil.
2880 2018-02-09 17:56:15 Crude oil #WTI free falls below $59 down more than 10% for the week as #StockMarket crash spreads into commodities and credit markets. #OOTT
2881 2018-02-09 17:56:13 Without a weak Iraqi border, isis cudnt have taken mosul. Without mosul, they cudnt link up important oil refinery and establish supply chain. Without those, there wudnt be any revenue.without revenue, no fight can sustain. It is all connected.

2884 2018-02-09 17:55:53 Oil India's board has declared an interim dividend of Rs 14 per equity share (face value of Rs 10 per equity share).
2885 2018-02-09 17:55:49 Again, even climate scientists working for the oil industry realized humans impacted climate by burning fossils. Why are you in such denial?Heavily invested in oil?

2912 2018-02-09 17:52:44 angry tweet of the day: when you take your car to the @nissan dealer to get an oil change (basic) & they manage to botch it & nearly kill you & your engine, ask for a refund then after 2 months are still demanding it - it's not a good look @NissanUSA #somad

2915 2018-02-09 17:52:30 Still virtually no one talking about the US Balance-of-Pmts problem that began in 3q14 when global CB's began net selling FX rsvs for the 1st time in 70 yrs (!!), as oil began being priced in non-USD (CNY) for the 1st time in 50 yrs as China re-opened the BW gold window thru CNY.
2916 2018-02-09 17:52:28 What kind of oil you use?
2917 2018-02-09 17:52:27 บ้าจริงป่าว
2918 2018-02-09 17:52:26 Because the law that was passed in Maryland did not allow for hospitals, health clinics, or pharmacies to become certified dispensaries. Also, medical professionals are not as familiar with the unique issues around dispensing of tinctures, oil, and dried flower.
2919 2018-02-09 17:52:17 PERFECT; but also seriously that nice bean breakdown from really creamy large white beans, plus the bit of potato starch--that should bind it all really nicely even with the added oil from chorizo?

2927 2018-02-09 17:51:04 Just came out from a facial and I apparently look 'glowing'. I personally think I look like I've been living underground for 7 years and someone has squirted oil on my face.
2928 2018-02-09 17:51:03 Ladies: if you bring your car in for an oil change & multi point LEAVE YO TAMPONS OR PADS IN YOUR PURSE. NO ONE TRYNA MOVE YO SHIT OVER TO CHECK THE CABIN FILTER BEHIND THE GLOVE BOX.

2942 2018-02-09 17:49:38 So true, we have it here in bulk, i just go wow fractal, don't want to spoil it. Have you tried the oven method, with almonds, olive oil, touch of paprika, garlic?
2943 2018-02-09 17:49:36 Finally getting my oil changed 
2944 2018-02-09 17:49:29 Catherine McKenna implies that oilfield workers are a danger to women. Really bitch???!!! That is insulting to so many of my family and friends who worked oil rigs, and are some of the kindest most respectful people on the planet doing that job to provide for their families.
2945 2018-02-09 17:49:16 Oil's worst week since Nov 2016. Hey, wasn't that the month of Election Day? @realDonaldTrump <--- You suck so bad its not even quantifiable. cc @BarackObama and Janet Yellen: We miss you!

2951 2018-02-09 17:48:27 Inflammation to the tear duct !!! Usually happens with certain eyelash or eyelid allergies. Sometimes excessive dry eyes can make your tear duct over work and it could cause some sort of excess tears. But mostly a sign of allergies, Or it could be a blocked oil gland 
2952 2018-02-09 17:48:16 They all want your oil too. Most of those weak minds will be against you or they make a small benign gesture which is more than you get from my country our weak minded politicans sell weapons to the ones bombing you. And we have a country of sheep that do nothing about it.

2958 2018-02-09 17:47:52 US under @POTUS Trump is after Al Qaeda - waving that name around gets US actions involving Derna - no US collusion otherwise - again, look to Italy, UK, and France & perhaps some other Western countries after oil/gas

2960 2018-02-09 17:47:08 I have NO idea. Maybe it was all the oil?? 
2961 2018-02-09 17:47:03 How Ants Is About to Shake Up the Oil Futures Market
2962 2018-02-09 17:46:54 I completely respect your argument. How do you suggest that we involve consumers so that they begin to regard the environment and buy ‘sustainable’ palm oil or products that contain it. If this cannot work, surely a total ban is more beneficial...?
2963 2018-02-09 17:46:54 Have you got any lavender essential oil? Works wonders on burns, best put on straight away but should still help. Hope it’s not too bad. x
2964 2018-02-09 17:46:52 It's incredible how many vendors don't understand that time to deploy isn't how fast they can spin up a cloud instance and give a new client their creds. It's more like, here's the keys for your new car, now go work in the oil fields so you can fill it up and drive off the lot.
2965 2018-02-09 17:46:48 I am not disabused of the notion of disappearing well paying oil jobs. Im disappointed industry is laying off when they sit on billions offshore and options while workers shoulder education costs and hope for less jobs. 80,000 job losses wtf #Canada
2966 2018-02-09 17:46:41 US is not involved - we have plenty of oil here at home

2975 2018-02-09 17:45:44 Most oil company scientists agree with the mainstream scientific consensus, they have know for decades that thy were damaging our planet and causing global warming. It is only the PR company scientists that are professional liars that you appear to trust. Can you explain that?

2978 2018-02-09 17:45:34 We are also coming at this issue from opposite ideological standpoints. I think pipelines are the best way to move our oil, I think it's important that we not let activists stop our oil industry and we still need oil for years to come.

2981 2018-02-09 17:44:42 Let every province look after itself then. BC gives more money to the eastern provinces to keep them afloat then they spend on themselves . Without BC, Canada would be a poor nation. The BC coast should not be sold to USA oil companies! Not now not ever!

2991 2018-02-09 17:43:28 Has anyone ever heard so many conservatives admitting that oil/gas is a finite resource & won't always be around? Where's that sentiment when they're opposing every clean energy bill that comes across their desks? #HJR1 #nmleg #nmpol
2992 2018-02-09 17:43:20 Sen. Brandt irritated by Land Grant fund being called "rainy day fund" it's a fund to replace oil & gas revenue when that is all gone. #nmleg #nmpol

2994 2018-02-09 17:43:08 Need some game theory here.  If the refiners or the oil producers go for highest profits, they both lose.  Best case is middle range oil prices to keep Producers, Refiners, and Consumers happy. That ensures high volumes for the pipes and barges too.

2996 2018-02-09 17:42:35 Red, We had two years of incredible leverage in Credit and in Vol.  This does not get cleaned up in a week.  People who are shorting this market are also liquidating this market.  Could go on for weeks.  Look at oil in 2015/2016
2997 2018-02-09 17:42:35 Hi Trixie, we use peanut oil manufactured via the hot-solvent extraction process with refining, bleaching and deodorizing. This removes virtually all of the proteins that cause allergic reactions.

2999 2018-02-09 17:42:28 Data Science should be part of standard control system for every oil &gas control system. Process performance, preventing maintenance, data analysis and saving energy are just some parts of side benefits. Unfortunately, too much resistance within owner side.

3006 2018-02-09 17:41:55 Silky, Remembered my tweet to you. We will WIN $OIL short!!! I was so down, I stopped looking at my account. Glad you stuck and we both minting some $'s
3007 2018-02-09 17:41:43 And dxy is just above 90. What happens when it crosses 100?

Five dollar oil?
3008 2018-02-09 17:41:36 I once saw the mark left on one of your fisherman’s arms from a supposed “ dead “ conger ! But thro yellow oil skins & 2 layers of clothes!  !

3010 2018-02-09 17:41:17 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
3011 2018-02-09 17:41:17 Remember, those are ok because defense contractors and oil companies are making bank jacking natural resources and bombing civilians.
3012 2018-02-09 17:41:13 Speak for yourself! None of us deserved this.  He was a snake oil salesman. That unfortunately people were sucked into his line.  No way in hell we deserved this.
3013 2018-02-09 17:41:08 hmm i just bought a bazoogum it was the color of cooking oil now i bought another it is clear i need a new source im gonna try elledistro on ebay
3014 2018-02-09 17:41:05 I just got a bottle of culinary lemon oil in the mail and it's amaaaaaazing. 
3015 2018-02-09 17:40:57 So if a club is owned by an oil rich state that makes all the players sales prices jump up worldwide. Interesting
3016 2018-02-09 17:40:48 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

3019 2018-02-09 17:40:21 ... car/oil industry power also explain why motorcycles are vilified in the US. Motorcycles could have been strong competition for cars.
3020 2018-02-09 17:40:19 Getting rid of coal would be better for everyone except the coal companies. The workers can be retrained to new sustainable jobs. The coal and oil companies should pay for the switch over to cover the cost of all the externalities that cost us clean air and water.
3021 2018-02-09 17:40:19 It would be better to stabilize again in $55-65 range. High enough to keep the oil fields working (hopefully they hedged higher to keep cash flow secure for 2018), but low enough to keep gas and diesel prices from becoming consumer/construction headwind. Would keep inflation down
3022 2018-02-09 17:40:14 ever try Oil of Oregano?
3023 2018-02-09 17:40:10 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
3024 2018-02-09 17:39:53 I think so, probably - some of the beans will break down a bit and the chorizo will give off oil. Sounds lovely!
3025 2018-02-09 17:39:51 Julep!!!! The liquid lipsticks, 5 in 1 foundation (concealer and countour Too), facial oils, serum sticks, cleansing oil, budge proof eyeliners, moisturizers. You name it they have it, and it’s AMAZING!!!

3026 2018-02-09 17:39:45 That's the oil company express. I'd guess 95% of the passengers (at least) are in the oil industry in some shape or form.
3027 2018-02-09 17:39:38 Instead of brushing the snow they have to wax/oil his chest as he slides
3028 2018-02-09 17:39:28 AB use to have so much $ they would literally give chqs to residents just for living there. Maybe instead of making is rain $ the gov't should have been prepping for the inevitable drop in oil and global transition to renewable fuels.
3029 2018-02-09 17:39:06 Today it still looked that way and I said ok seriously what did you do she tell me while browning a roast the oil splashed on her face but SHES FINE IT DIDNT HURT why are old people so stubborn

3031 2018-02-09 17:38:56  When the incense smell makes you queezy have you ever tried eating a peppermint with natural flavor like altoids, or smelling peppermint oil? It might be a yin/cooling herbal energy to balance all that yang/fire energy of the incense, and it helps nausea in and of itself.
3032 2018-02-09 17:38:46 Trump-Zinke offshore plan designed to perpetuate climate science denial and sabotage rights to public participation in decision making inherent to our nation's bedrock environmental laws. Thanks @MelodyGutierrez for reporting on the Big Oil propaganda session in real terms.
3033 2018-02-09 17:38:44 Can you please tell me how regular citizens are better because of oil. 

Random fun fact:
In 1832 the first ever electric car rolled of the line and was subsequently quashed by imperial oil.

3042 2018-02-09 17:37:59 There are still tons of retailers though. Amazon isn't anywhere near standard oil. They would make it so you couldn't even compete. I am talking like not even being able to barrel up your oil or transport it.
3043 2018-02-09 17:37:59 You reason the way you do because you are in a comfort zone. 
Just imagine what this country will be like if the crude oil that was discovered in Oloibiri was in Kano. Ponders over this but be honest with yourself.
3044 2018-02-09 17:37:49 The oil on the persons finger is damaging that shell
3045 2018-02-09 17:37:49 The irony is that the dude who calls people shills, is shilling for a lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist.
3046 2018-02-09 17:37:46 I suspect a high proportion of oil/coal heated homes are in rural areas where full benefits of scale are difficult to realise.

3048 2018-02-09 17:37:07 How does the age of the Earth make you only trust scientists that work for PR firms hired by oil companies? There is no reason renewable energy needs to drive up energy prices for consumers. It is nuclear and oil lobbyists protecting their profits that do that.

3056 2018-02-09 17:36:07 Very nice bread, lots of olive oil. I am leaning towards no tomatoes, but that is a lot of work for the beans to do at making it into a coherent whole, you know?

3059 2018-02-09 17:35:49 Well done Oil 
3060 2018-02-09 17:35:42 This is why most foreign companies exited the oil sands. They saw this SJW socialism and increased tax and regulatory burden coming. Look for more foreign and domestic exits from Alberta. Calgary will have ghost downtown. Ghost LRT trains to nowhere.

3071 2018-02-09 17:34:46 God...I really hope the new National Energy Regulator takes transgendered people into account when evaluating future mines, pipelines, oil drilling, etc.  Oh, and also my aunt....she's against pretty much everything.
3072 2018-02-09 17:34:45 Well they did shut the tap on  oil sands development.  Ooops.
3073 2018-02-09 17:34:37 I was just thinking that. Chris Packham did a good job in his recent doc about the Orang Rimba tribe. It wasn't hard hitting enough though. Didn't expose the problem of the greenwashing around certified palm oil either. But it was a start.

3114 2018-02-09 17:31:08 Instead of refined oil using coconut oil, ghee and mustard oil. Instead of refined salt, using Arabian sea salt and Himalayan pink salt. Refined flour is replaced by wheat ground at the chakki !!!

3119 2018-02-09 17:30:26 This really comes back to people needing to take responsibility for their gear. I don't think you should be able to get your license without being able to check oil / tire pressure (or whatever's appropriate for your vehicle.)

we also waste the most on military spending and wars that we create to benefit oil companies and banks

Tata ran an airline service (Tata Airlines or was it Tata Air Service?) which Nehru converted to Air India.

But I think some heavy industries like crude oil and heavy industries were under governments worldwide till quite recently (some are still under goverments).

3138 2018-02-09 17:28:51 Of course, I agree

Currently, some big changes that could make US easily better would be:

-decreasing military bases, closing imperial bases around world, pulling out of wars

-stop funding oil companies & fund renewable energy like solar

-re-regulate Wall St to prevent fraud
3139 2018-02-09 17:28:48 There are alot of issues in the oil sector which is too difficult to resolve by government, pls why?
3140 2018-02-09 17:28:43 Because they blamed the oil price when people lost their jobs. When jobs come back, they claim it was all them.
3141 2018-02-09 17:28:37 It is! It's that "world's spiciest instant noodles" that people do as a challenge. Use half of the diabolically red oil packet and it's really tasty!
3142 2018-02-09 17:28:30 Oil under $60 - crude price slide continues as West Texas Intermediate now at $59.21/bbl. Oil is down almost 10% since last January. #ableg #yyc
3143 2018-02-09 17:28:29 They also live on the greatest deposit of oil in the would and it state run and not sold to us as opposed to Saudi Arabi who is horrible to their citizens but are our allies so we ignore them to keep us on top of the oil market

3146 2018-02-09 17:28:14 Yup. It’s not even a new pipeline. They want to add volume to a current pipeline. The wine boycott is an attack on small business in a part of BC that supports oil and gas and has thousands of people that work in the oilpatch. Or used to anyways. It’s all just a cluster fuck now
3147 2018-02-09 17:28:03 Not to mention a wedding on wednesday. So yep, i can handle 4 days, but the wedding is the real challenge.
3148 2018-02-09 17:28:03 Starting to be bullish on oil here

3158 2018-02-09 17:27:08 Yeah especially with “hot” oils cause you never know how you might react. Peppermint is really strong. This guy at an oil convention spilt a bunch on himself and went into hypothermia 
3159 2018-02-09 17:27:07 Land Officer Aubry Dunn says most of the growth (75%) has come from Land Office, not from stocks. "Some day we're going to quit adding to the fund. Oil and gas is a finite resource." Need to think about that as you look at taking more money from fund. #nmleg #nmpol
3160 2018-02-09 17:27:06 Clarify what you mean by 'oil company". Is it one of the International Oil Companies or an Oil Servicing firm?
3161 2018-02-09 17:27:00 Is fall in oil now financially correlated w/broader mkt decline, or was oil headed lower on its own as harsh winter eased,inventories started rising,commercials were short oil by >1 std deviation while specs were uber strong, setting up big short squeeze?

3168 2018-02-09 17:26:21 He was able to sell enough of that snake oil to win an election, and the nation has yet to recover from it. 

Sadly, we cannot return it and get our nation back.
3169 2018-02-09 17:26:19 Finally someone gets the statement correctly...some say grace, oil, I even heard grease ... LMAO TF 
3170 2018-02-09 17:26:16 lmao yeah my skin was looking crazzyyy. I stand by vitamin e & almond oil
3171 2018-02-09 17:26:13 So ok 3%. Not 2%. Now show me your 99% source
3172 2018-02-09 17:26:11 keep in mind budget deal had other items that were in the tax extenders like oil spill tax for instance which was extended through 2018, so this probably takes a tax extender bill off the table. so any 2018 BTC/PTC will likely need to be stand alone (bill or amend to bill)

3181 2018-02-09 17:25:06 Very cool new products hit the shelves today. Artisan made honey and avocado oil from Mexico.
3182 2018-02-09 17:25:04 Oil Funds and Subway's
3183 2018-02-09 17:24:59 This is literally true. I used to have a list of the top ten rules (and how Exxon broke them all during the Exxon-Valdez oil spill). These were rules one and two.
3184 2018-02-09 17:24:47 And now I have to go to Monterey  & take the car for an oil change 
3185 2018-02-09 17:24:47 I literally heard my stomach screaming for food rn. I ate samyang for breakfast and thats it. Nothing more.
3186 2018-02-09 17:24:46 Someone who has tuna in salt water can we please trade, I have one in vegetable oil
3187 2018-02-09 17:24:36 We also need access to the East, to stop foreign oil.
3188 2018-02-09 17:24:35 Yes and I meant to say fracking. It's happening in my state as well and we've had 100s of small earthquakes. They're destroying our planet but as long as the 1% continues to make money off of oil they'll continue to frack. This admin is about 1 thing. Money.
3189 2018-02-09 17:24:20 Hector hit me with “ since your not going out today I’m going to take your car and I’ll leave you the Honda cause it needs an oil change “

3191 2018-02-09 17:23:46 I wouldnt probably do that 7 day water fast challenge. But ill try to eat 1 meal a day starting tomorrow.
3192 2018-02-09 17:23:43 I have oil sticks too!  But they were too wide (and too soft in the heat of my apartment) for the lines I wanted to make for my first pass.  Thanks for the encouragement though; progress posts to come ;-)
3193 2018-02-09 17:23:35 Lavender oil is amazing!! Diffusing it and putting a drop on my pillow helps me sleep better at night. 
3194 2018-02-09 17:23:35 Not until you stop using palm oil
3195 2018-02-09 17:23:30 Coconut oil is working wonders in my hair
3196 2018-02-09 17:23:27 とりあえず頑張ります……
3197 2018-02-09 17:23:26 Hmm...I wonder if they’re friendly enough to gift me with a vacation to their happy, warm island... 
(And I’ve had to be slathered with oil for a photo shoot before, but sadly it wasn’t coconut oil so it was fairly unpleasant and I couldn’t wait to shower it off.) 
3198 2018-02-09 17:23:22 If you want mining and oil to end, but don't want to give up your luxuries, you need to shut up, or be known as the third world rapist party. Now who harms POC again?
3199 2018-02-09 17:23:21 who knew that the keebler elf was also a doctor. next up, betsy de vos gives lessons on how to change the oil in your car, followed by john kelley giving a talk on the evils of racism and domestic violence.
3200 2018-02-09 17:23:17 The media NEEEDS TO COVER THIS! so the fools burying their heads in the (oil)sand actually see what we are fighting for

3203 2018-02-09 17:22:43 I couldn’t remember “olive oil” so I wrote “pan lube” and I think this is going to be a permanent thing now.

3208 2018-02-09 17:22:28 There's some fear about interest rates, but the unwind in oil is a contributing factor.
3209 2018-02-09 17:22:26 come w/ me to get them threaded!! mix castor oil + coconut oil and put it on your brows & they’ll grow back in no time

3211 2018-02-09 17:22:09 Hi @orangulandtrust @RSPOtweets @orangutans 
I understand that the actual palm oil is not the problem, it is the methods of harvesting and the unsustainability with which it’s done. But most people are not concerned enough to check that everything is RSPO certified, so how could

3214 2018-02-09 17:21:56 El peak oil es un mito pero las reservas comerciales de Colombia no son muy grandes y se acabaran. De ahi no sigue que tener tierras sera "el futuro" o lo mas rentable. Esa idea de la agricultura como fuente de desarrollo y riqueza es bien primitiva.
3215 2018-02-09 17:21:49 I get the same way. I have no appetite if I dont smoke. I'll eat but very little. I can usually find some if you need any.  Their easy to make to! They have some good recipes for edibles on youtube. I like to make it infused with coconut oil and just add it to whatever I eat.

3218 2018-02-09 17:21:35 That is because they are using it to keep oil in the ground.  Venezuela took the oil companies by force; these fascists are drowning the resource sector in regulations so that they will pull out.  Until someone in this Country starts using the courts against them it will continue

3243 2018-02-09 17:19:12 lol good question.  As a morning drink (add Lion's Mane too).  Coconut oil helps bind it so you aren't left with a ton of powder at the the bottom of the cup.
3244 2018-02-09 17:19:06 Interest rates do not go up because of stocks and stocks are not totally a reflection of the economy. The TSX has done so poorly because of its over dependence on oil and gold and it's lack of technology listings.

3269 2018-02-09 17:17:30 Here's a thought.  How about all those opposed to pipelines and oil live like it.  Do away with all of the things that comes from oil.  That includes all of there phones, computers and lap tops.
3270 2018-02-09 17:17:30 Great work Niki, brands and retailers really do listen to consumer's voices so use your influence to ask that they only use GOOD palm oil. Only by working together will we make sustainable palm oil the norm.

3283 2018-02-09 17:16:34 Maybe the movie takes place in an area where they can sell the oil rights to their swamp-adjacent land. The mystery is starting to unravel!!!
3284 2018-02-09 17:16:12 @SXM_Help what’s going on with your stock?? Daddy is 6 months over due for an oil change! #letthegoodtimesroll
3285 2018-02-09 17:16:11 Ok let’s see your source that the number is actually 99% and not that you pulled it out of your asa
3286 2018-02-09 17:16:05 We all lose. Carbon emissions will still occur as bitumen is refined (overseas) so Canada is still contributing to carbon emissions. BC's coast is here for the WORLD to enjoy: noise pollution & ship strikes threatening SRKW; oil spill will wipe out species as Exxon Valdez did.

3290 2018-02-09 17:15:41 HPG > Peshmerga. The Chauvinists in power in Iraqi Kurdistan have fucked Kurds over for oil and power. Peshmerga should support their Hevalen in the fight against the dominant male and the nation-state in its entirety.
3291 2018-02-09 17:15:35 Huge trend line in spx here around 2560 - dating back to oil price crash induced lows of 2016. Marks 10.8% correction.
3292 2018-02-09 17:15:34 2% is a lie
You certainly can act naive when convenient.
3293 2018-02-09 17:15:33 In honor of #NationalPizzaDay I'm going to try a pizza with anchovies for the first time. I'm thinking olive oil, black olives, and tomatoes for the other toppings.

What do you recommend?
3294 2018-02-09 17:15:33 Woe Canada in spades! Price of Canadian heavy crude oil (WCS) now struggling to stay above $28.50 barrel. Not a misprint.
3295 2018-02-09 17:15:31 They've known about the oil and gas fields for a long time, but never had any official contracts with any company.
3296 2018-02-09 17:15:30 Because I posted a real number not a made up one? What ? Lmao
3297 2018-02-09 17:15:29 Today is going to be a good one! Woke up to sunshine, rubbed coconut oil all over my face/bod, threw on a bikini and overalls, and this mama is beach bound! Santa Monica and sunning my buns today

3299 2018-02-09 17:15:05 Agree! Oil was hard to crack !!!
3300 2018-02-09 17:14:58 Wow! I can't believe this is with markers! It looks like watercolor, or maybe even classical oil glazing? Very nice!
3301 2018-02-09 17:14:50 what if oil me up scooby
3302 2018-02-09 17:14:46 My tomato sauce just contains tinned tomato, onion, garlic, olive oil, sugar and @BallymaloeRelis relish. Am I doing it wrongly?!

3304 2018-02-09 17:14:32 Black castor oil is different -- made with roasted beans so it's BLACK and smells like burnt peanut shells but my hair is sucking it up like a sponge.  It's so good. I mix it with some thinner oils to make it spread around better.

Unless you’re ready to host millions of climate refugees (among other things)? We need to end the oil era now or pay even more in the future. Oil is finite anyhow!

3330 2018-02-09 17:12:41 @kemron94 - Why do you say “more than half”?  I think we need a referendum. I, for one, say Let Alberta process and refine their own oil and sell it to the rest of Canada
3331 2018-02-09 17:12:39 It's a daily struggle for her. Does CBD oil help the fibro? Have you tried it?
3332 2018-02-09 17:12:39 this is a disease connected to brain. needs immediate treatment with boiling hot brahmi oil pouring on head with other medicines otherwise everything will go beyond control.

Incidentally, I have heard that Jamacian Black Castor oil helps hair growth (though that's not why I'm using it.) It has a weird scent but it fades pretty fast and it works GOOD.

3397 2018-02-11 23:52:57 The oil embargo was a protective measure issued because of threats of Japanese expansionism and Japanese talks of an 'inevitable war' with the US. Why would the US sell oil to a nation that openly threatens to attack them?

3400 2018-02-11 23:52:18 I suppose all that oil sold and being that they are the second largest economy in the ME would mean no electronic transfers. Yeah I’m buying that.

3403 2018-02-11 23:51:47 MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA: a supplement that has fractioned butter and coconut oil to have high concentrations of both SCFAs from butter and MCTs from coconut
3404 2018-02-11 23:51:32 Acrylic is water based. Oil is oil based. Oil drying time is longer and easier to blend.

3409 2018-02-11 23:51:08 It definitely would have happened eventually because FDR was dead set on ensuring it happened no matter what he needed to do to provoke the Japanese. He basically told the Japanese as much as its ambassadors *begged* him to lift the oil embargo!

3426 2018-02-11 23:49:31 I actually hate the consistency of regular Coconut Oil i only use it for cooking if i dont have virgin olive oil or to do oil pulling (look it up) thats it i dont use it in my hair nor skin
3427 2018-02-11 23:49:27 Hope Texas and other oil states block shipments to CA equal to the number of barrels blocked.

CA must learn there are consequences. 

Beware America, beware!

3429 2018-02-11 23:49:17 Now Maroon is another story. He fits perfectly in your comment.
3430 2018-02-11 23:49:16 Not quite as well as the deniers and pro big oil shills that have intentionally confused you.
3431 2018-02-11 23:49:11 Remember somebody tried to shade someone for using coconut oil as a moisturizer....... they weren’t a dermatologist and the coconut oil was actually working for the person.

3434 2018-02-11 23:49:03 #MH370 I don’t know that they are switching to a sled for that nice flattish seafloor. Just suspect they made some configuration adjustments in Henderson. Always possible they took #Constructor in for an oil change and tire rotation.
3435 2018-02-11 23:48:54 I got this! Quick change the oil
3436 2018-02-11 23:48:52 Lmao. Oil and pepper combo
3437 2018-02-11 23:48:35 if it's any comfort, I've seen that it's more the stimulation from rubbing the edges that facilitates growth. You could try with a different oil first before taking the plunge. lol!
3438 2018-02-11 23:48:33 I am not trying to troll, like for real. How do you guys justify the fact that not producing oil here in Canada means that it will be extracted from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Nigeria.
3439 2018-02-11 23:48:05 Jesus your an idiot, take a trip to my home state if Texas and tell then your dribble,  WE ARE ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST OIL PRODUCERS,WE also have the Worlds largest Refineries.Oil cones in different forms if you knew anything,what we import is low grade oil used to make diesel
3440 2018-02-11 23:48:03 Right or wrong, his views may explain the Liberal party's lack of success in Alberta. Oil age ending by 2050 seems unlikely at this point.

3446 2018-02-11 23:47:15 i do wish yall stop putting coconut oil in your hair  yall not fully washing it out so it stays on your scalp/roots and when u blow dry it your frying your hair, literally (hence why you can cook food w/it). if its ALOT of smoke in the room = you not fully washing it out

3448 2018-02-11 23:46:39 Any silk durag, or brush would do. But as for products use Shea moisturizer curl enhancer & some form of oil (Coconut, herbal, etc) But you gotta brush like a mf for them ripples to connect.

3459 2018-02-11 23:44:35 Paid Eco-protestors and eco-zealots are the same everywhere. Ideologically oblivious to the realities of their world and unflinching in their determination to stop Canadian oil at all costs even if it's completely illogical and hurtful to the environment of the world. Idiots!
3460 2018-02-11 23:44:32 Ok, so if corn oil is made from corn and olive oil is from olives, where in the entire fekk does baby oil come from?

3461 2018-02-11 23:44:29 Massage some type of essential oil or like Castro oil on your scalp then shower after
3462 2018-02-11 23:44:24 Alhamdulillah...
3463 2018-02-11 23:44:07 It like mixing water and oil. Totally different in every way. Any true Christian can show why. Gemma still hasn’t answered where her friend Rev Alfreddie’s Church is located. What he practices especially since he is Nation of Islam. Which is not Christianity.
3464 2018-02-11 23:43:56 It was a basal ganglia ischemic (not a bleed) stroke.  They said high cholesterol and high BP are the reasons for the stroke.  I'm not overweight and don't eat poorly.  They said the coconut oil could have contributed to the stroke.
3465 2018-02-11 23:43:21 I use a leave in conditioner and coconut oil with it, also. Don’t know if that’ll help, but worth a shot.

3467 2018-02-11 23:43:09 I used to have a mix of almond oil, castor oil and coconut (the liquidy kind) oil and I’d use it on my brows and lashes! Worked really well with me
3468 2018-02-11 23:43:03 if the salad is dry i might as well just die ! that rhymes but it’s also true. people better put some balsamic vinegar and olive oil and salt and pepper! that’s the law
3469 2018-02-11 23:42:51 Putting coconut oil on my face is my new favorite thing
3470 2018-02-11 23:42:28 How do I get added?
3471 2018-02-11 23:42:27 I could live inside my oil diffuser.

3475 2018-02-11 23:42:00 Vitamin E oil
3476 2018-02-11 23:41:57 Very simple. If I were Trump and I knew I were innocent I wouldn't even think of firing the man who can declare my innocence. He refuses to impose sanctions on Russia, refuses to criticize Putin when they get caught supplying oil to North Korea. Trump owes $$ to Putin. Simple
3477 2018-02-11 23:41:46 For lesbian love essence of lily or violet is ideal... For gay men, use rose oil, or perhaps extract of a green carnation....
3478 2018-02-11 23:41:42 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

3481 2018-02-11 23:41:05 Your team is rock solid now. 

But unfortunately (for u), your best players will want a salary rise sooner than later. You won't be able to compete with the oil clubs, Barca, Real and Utd.

Basically, u are Arsenal circa 2008. It's unfair but good management only gets u so far

3484 2018-02-11 23:40:36 Well I use prescription hydroquinone for my dark spots and I wash with Cetaphil and my Clarisonic. And then I use Bahi serum, tea tree oil, and shea butter to moisturize
3485 2018-02-11 23:40:29 LETS GO @roberthight7000
3486 2018-02-11 23:40:21 Ugh yeah thanks for the extra (maybe) $50 which doesn’t do shit for me. Doesn’t even fill my gas tank. With all the great “deals” you’ve given the oil companies gas should be free - Trump you’re a douche of the superior kind!
3487 2018-02-11 23:40:20 Especially fruity Comté!!!!! 
Goat cheese on grilled toasts of a good bread, plus a light trait of honey, on a salad, with a olive oil + balsamic dressing, pepper + salt = perfection.
3488 2018-02-11 23:40:18 Omg this could be it. My last moisturizer didn't make me break it and it was oil free. This new one I've been using isn't

Can I put this new coconut oil stuff I bought on? 
She said No! Just Vaseline!
I heard olive oil works good. 
She said No! Just Vaseline!
Is oil free moisturizer something to use?
She said No! Just Vaseline!
2days later the Vaseline working! hmm

3495 2018-02-11 23:39:30 Not really. Try the result of about 70 years of a concerted effort to build a welfare state. Also, almost all of the oil revenue is kept outside the Norwegian economy and invested in their sovereign wealth fund (which by mandate is not allowed to invest in Norway).

3510 2018-02-11 23:37:50 You speak as though the current ratio of CPI increases to wage increases were a permanent fact.  It'll hold true for the service sector, but oil drilling and construction on the Keystone pipeline are examples of wage increases tied to a net lowering of CPI as energy costs drop.

 Anyone else before I place the order?

3522 2018-02-11 23:36:19 Ehh, it's an example of artificial inflation. I.e. money laundering. I'm glad you mentioned something tho. A lot of people don't understand that aspect of paint. I have been following you, but with this Oil project, it doesn't strike me like your ink. . . .
3523 2018-02-11 23:36:17 B/c it looks like adding a shxt ton of oil to an infants hair promotes rapid hair growth. Bxtches dumb but that’s a social media flaw.

3552 2018-02-11 23:32:48 Prof. Al Lucas nails it. BC's strategy, flawed in law, is focused on creating delay and uncertainty such that the project is abandoned as economically unviable. Certainty in the legal and regulatory regime is critical to investment in projects in the oil sands.

3559 2018-02-11 23:32:02 Depending on the veg, you can change oil for butter or a different oil (I tend to use Olive), add different spices, fry for a different period of time.
Method doesn't change :)

3576 2018-02-11 23:29:37 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
3577 2018-02-11 23:29:35 To break the monopoly of Nigerian oil marketers, @MBuhari should allow countries like RUSSIA ( @KremlinRussia_E @EmbassyofRussia ) , VENEZUALA @Venezuala_wh5p to import the product into the country. @china people should also allow to invest heavly in the sector. @NNPCgroup F.Y.I
3578 2018-02-11 23:29:35 Right... how do today's deficits help with that dream? Less money for university, less jobs, no money multiplier(ever take an econ course), more debt, interest payments. Are you familiar with statoil? Norway exceeds Kyoto, uses hydrocarbons and excels in green by selling oil.
3579 2018-02-11 23:29:30 It was the "he was anointed with oil 7 times" that broke me
3580 2018-02-11 23:29:28 see that vaccine's NEED growth accel;irators 2make the vaccines grow
but these growth accelerator's cause cancer to grow[add in the preservatives that cause autism and adverse reactions to peanut via allergies cause by peanut oil adjuvant and you have murder on grand scam scale
3581 2018-02-11 23:29:09 @CBCPolitics When discussing the KM pipeline please give equal time to BCers who are antipipeline. We have many good reasons to stop this pipeline from ever being built. Ask Notley why Alb doesn't build a refinery instead of sending dirty oil to Texas.
3582 2018-02-11 23:29:06 Basic go to sautéed veg:
Little Oil in a pan.
Heat oil.
Throw in veg (big stuff first, small stuff last).
Toss around in pan.
Add mixed herbs, ground ginger and smoked paprika.
Toss some more.
Once as soft as you like, use tongs to pick out and serve.
3583 2018-02-11 23:29:01 Markets are likely ti dip further as there is no catalyst to drive it up. Only good news is crude oil prices have fallen and thereby petrol price at pump are likely to fall in next few days. Now with elections on weekend the focus will be on the what the outcome will be
3584 2018-02-11 23:28:56 It's nothing more than snake oil sold by a circus ringleader. May sound good at first, but it is just a gimmick and nothing more. Smoke & Mirrors. A quick diversion to avert attention away from what you are really doing
3585 2018-02-11 23:28:50 Right. Mike Hudema has all he needs. And gets paid by the Americans to protest Canadian oil industry, ensures the US gets cheaper landlocked Canadian oil. Can’t see a problem with that? It’s not about the climate. It’s about money for Greenpeace.
3586 2018-02-11 23:28:36 100% there is no guarantee but my guess is we will have our answer in and around Christmas time. This season has gone pretty much as I expected for Sekera.

3588 2018-02-11 23:28:23 This is when the invasions starts.

Just like when Iraq chose to trade oil in Euro's rather than dollars.

Boom! Instant invasion!
3589 2018-02-11 23:27:51 Dear Wall Street. No doubt you've realized there are tough times ahead. Equities were overheated and a correction is underway. Gold has been a poor investment, interest rates are still low and oil can't break $70. Where will you find the returns this year? ..do you need a clue?

3594 2018-02-11 23:27:21 Not a rec and can't explain source of knowledge, but fast-acting, non-addictive, organic hemp oil helps relieves anxiety. Including trauma-based, long-standing anxiety. For sensitive people, one daily drop is enough. 

No wonder GOP wants to stop it.
3595 2018-02-11 23:27:17 Too bad its an anti splashing chemical that mcdonalds uses in their oil (that sounds really good to be putting in your body) and not actually the fries themselves.
3596 2018-02-11 23:27:11 I'll give you 25th Anniversary of the 1st cup win and closing Rexall but the rest is an awfully big stretch. No different than what the Habs have done for yrs.

3601 2018-02-11 23:27:00 With the interview with the  so call celebrity, I who have watched and attended since the 60’s will watch never again.
3602 2018-02-11 23:26:53 My essential oil diffuser has such a positive impact on my life
3603 2018-02-11 23:26:52 Exactly. I have zero faith in Chiarelli. I hope he’s fired, believe you me. But with a competent GM, it shouldn’t be that hard when you have the C depth that the Oilers have.

3605 2018-02-11 23:25:51 Idk how naturals in the Midwest do it. I’d love to wear my hair out more, but I didn’t put in all this work for it to be frozen w/ coconut oil & deprived of moisture by stepping outside for .5 seconds
3606 2018-02-11 23:25:49 Whole lotta oil allowed
3607 2018-02-11 23:25:32 One of my goals/resolutions for 2018 was to eat more veggies. Tonight I made Brussels sprouts, roasted with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and omg y'all they're really really good. #success
3608 2018-02-11 23:25:25 Mike smoked ribs, while they were smoking we were deciding on a healthy side. Fried yellow squash. The fact I used olive oil plus the squash makes it healthy, right?
3609 2018-02-11 23:25:17 Forgot about the 25th anniversary but opening of Rogers hardly falls into that category. Sather was the equivelant to a banner retirement & what would you like them to do with the heritage classic? Legends game is part of the deal, should they not take part? Come on man.
3610 2018-02-11 23:25:11 Install safer barriers. What’s it going to take an injury or worse?
3611 2018-02-11 23:25:01 In other news, oil companies call rising temperatures a “bubble”, the Joker calls Batman a “fraud”, and the grim reaper calls medicine a “Ponzi scheme”!
3612 2018-02-11 23:24:43 Love the feeling of going to bed after I've mosturised and done my skin care routine and put argan oil in my hair, going feel so good in the morning 
3613 2018-02-11 23:24:36 when people say “tOmAtO iS a FrUiT” to explain why they think it’s okay to put pineapple on pizza, do they realize how dumb they are?? are you telling me you dont put salt and oil in tomato sauce before putting it on pizza?? lmfao
3614 2018-02-11 23:24:26 Hit up factory motor parts. Cheap ass oil
3615 2018-02-11 23:24:14 Your gnocchi inspired me to make pasta today as it's been a while. I opted to go with an oil based spaghetti with rapini (green veggie if you aren't familiar with it), hot sausage, mushrooms & scallions. Forgot to take a pic :( Will do next time I make it. 
3616 2018-02-11 23:23:29 Lol its normal in kt
3617 2018-02-11 23:23:25 Techically no,?but it’s an excellent carrier oil for essential oils!

3628 2018-02-11 23:22:06 #1 little man 6'3 227lbs. Is far from fat, that said. You might want to go back and have someone who can read look at my tweet, I "said" we do not buy our OIL from the middle east, who buys a public company is not my concern its called the Free Market, we own , they own.

3634 2018-02-11 23:21:17 boleh, but for those yg dry skin i tak galakkan sbb after guna cleansing oil and face wash 2/3minit dia mcm ketat sikit muka. simple masa saya beli takde sale so rm38
3635 2018-02-11 23:21:12 @realDonaldTrump Wow, whatever will I spend my WHOPPING $9 on?? Oh I know, cup of cofeffe. Meanwhile oil (gas), health care, groceries continue to go up. Why don’t you “trickle down” to HELL!
3636 2018-02-11 23:20:50 The first injury is concerning. Knee plus age. This looks scary bad moving forward imo
3637 2018-02-11 23:20:46 They have cattle, poultry and  and pigs but killing dog is a tradition-the disgraceful aspect is the torture these poor animals endure which goes on for days prior to the actual boiling in oil to make a sweet greasy soup and kebabs. It 's about Tradition not need. Bon Apetite.
3638 2018-02-11 23:20:34 Man I am so happy no migraines for a month cuz of the meds I use and quiet possibly the CBD oil I am vaping
3639 2018-02-11 23:20:26 China's buying power (biggest in the world for oil)might help avoid worldwide war, but tRump is protected by zios and the price appears to be war with Iran. They'll use, mostly, the Wahhabi states as cannonfodder

3644 2018-02-11 23:18:56 Is olive and essential oil?
3645 2018-02-11 23:18:55 This is a blueline that is going to have play three pairings regularly...as riding a top tandem is an option they do not have. #Oilers
3646 2018-02-11 23:18:50 I used brown sugar (because it has more grit, but white is probably ok too), olive oil, honey, lemon juice, and ground coffee (I feel like a dark roast is better for skin care)

I just put the amount of each together according to what I felt like my face needed lol
3647 2018-02-11 23:18:39 Or I could sodomize myself with the business end of a rake. Nowhere near the cost and double the entertainment value of watching the oil play....

3652 2018-02-11 23:17:44 Wow. I'm impressed. I thought Blair was being willfully obtuse. You have topped him. So dilbit doesn't sink because...the world uses oil. Is that what you are saying, Failure Ergo Sum?
3653 2018-02-11 23:17:42 Yeah, we’re killing your people for oil, but let’s do diving!
3654 2018-02-11 23:17:35 I’ve been watching Lucas oil TV makes dirt vision look like a bunch of amateurs 
3655 2018-02-11 23:17:30 Is the moisturizer water based? I don’t think HA would do much under oil unless you use a water based moisturizer in between. Check out @CarolineHirons website, I think she has a guide to using hyaluronic acid on it somewhere.

3658 2018-02-11 23:17:03 So EVERYONE sells skin care products now? Smh.

Just because you got perfect sunlight after pouring coconut oil on your face doesn’t mean you can start a business.
3659 2018-02-11 23:16:54 I love Avocado I put it in salads ,eat it with olive oil, pepper ans salt I’m addicted!

3664 2018-02-11 23:15:24 I use an anti-aging moisturiser or a facial oil in the morning and an anti-blemish one at night, both creams by moogoo. They are the only creams I have ever tried that don't give me spots!
3665 2018-02-11 23:15:20 Mark Phillips' recital on different modes of oil an enigma of Stalkers or a quotation from tradition.

3667 2018-02-11 23:15:03 I get major anxiety thinking about people slathering coconut oil on their face
3668 2018-02-11 23:14:44 I mean no disrespect w this question, but an essential oil diffuser is really a tiny humidifier w some smelly stuff in it, yes?

3670 2018-02-11 23:14:41 If he's playing well, there is plenty of ice for all three...as none are 1st pairing guys in the here and now. If they overpay Nurse, which shouldn't happen, that could change.
3671 2018-02-11 23:14:30 That’s where the breakdown happens, and the split. Will corporate Dems be rewarded for taking Big$ from Pharm, Oil, Gas, Insurance, Prisons, Private Education, Wall St, Bank, on and on, etc etc. Will voters have the knowledge and guts to see thru the $, and vote 3rd Party?

3688 2018-02-11 23:12:02 Guarantee you whatever team won would've had a reunion. Let's not forget, this was an NHL driven thing...a celebration is part of the deal. Also, what are these other reunions you speak of? I guess you can count the closing of Rexall if you'd like but that was a no brainer.

3709 2018-02-11 23:09:39 @SenatorCollins. Where's our healthcare?! Before Tax Vote I warned you... I warned you Cannot Trust Trump, McConnell or Speaker Ryan and to Vote NO on the Tax Bill. The Tax Bill is a Joke... the same Snake Oil we the public have been sold before and it Never works!
3710 2018-02-11 23:09:37 Well yes or no it's running really really good but it's still blowing oil out the oil fill on the valve cover and I can't quite figure out why it's doing that
3711 2018-02-11 23:09:36 We found coconut  oil to be pretty good. But totally agree on the stuff like the fat free butter spray.
3712 2018-02-11 23:09:35 gonna get this car oil change and ima join disc
3713 2018-02-11 23:09:31 Oh, "they knew what was going on" must be great to have the good oil like you. I was thinking about the little people who work for a living and, I know thisseems quaintto you insiders, they rely on the media for "what's going on"
3714 2018-02-11 23:09:24 ♪'Antarctica'♪ by Midnight Oil(@pgarrett et al)
3715 2018-02-11 23:09:03 Or trying to recover oil and gas fields for personal profit. Private Russian military contractors have a deal with the Syrian government to retain a portion of the profits from recovered oil, gas and mining operations.
3716 2018-02-11 23:08:31 Lol very quick. Would have loved to see the old Tardis in Oil Drum lane & see whet the Steptoe’s would have made of it? Think the beeb missed a trick there lol
3717 2018-02-11 23:08:25 Time to get dirty with the Lucas Oil late models
3718 2018-02-11 23:08:24 The oil that is found in poison ivy is called "urushiol."
3719 2018-02-11 23:08:16 Squeeze lubricating pipes with pincers or dent them with hammers, so that the flow of oil is obstructed.
3720 2018-02-11 23:08:04 How about you start a clean energy movement? The need to get away from non-renewable energy is inevitable. I understand you do not believe in climiate change, but surely a smart man such as yourself can see the need to get away from non-renewable energy sources such as coal/oil.
3721 2018-02-11 23:07:55 Except that pipe isn't even thick enough to support the pressure of an oil pipeline. It'd rupture within an hour of being put into service. You're clinically insane if you think it's a pipeline
3722 2018-02-11 23:07:36 @angrybrigade Yes, the oil painting is by karl friedrich called the return of the crusader. It angers antifa so much which is why I like it.  Anyways, there is no need to get all defensive. Tommy has exposed you and now you're all mad. I also recommend Tommys book. good read
3723 2018-02-11 23:06:54 presciption medicines & general medicines are tested on animals, oil/petrol production/use kills animals. You have eyes but selective eye sight
3724 2018-02-11 23:06:49 4 ripe avocados and pitted, 1 level teaspoon chopped garlic, half teaspoon of Sea salt, place ingredients in food processor and blend. Start to drizzle in extra virgin olive oil about 2 tablespoons and finish with the juice of a half of lemon. Serve with pita chips or tortilla
3725 2018-02-11 23:06:48 Yes. Because the administration of an ineffective flu vacc on their premises is not snake oil. Guess it depends who profits?
3726 2018-02-11 23:06:47 The beauty supply has this tea tre oil that comes in a squeezy tube. I used that on all my piercings along with anti bacterial soap
3727 2018-02-11 23:06:19 Which one? For me, that would depend on the oil.
3728 2018-02-11 23:06:12 They sold everything to China. Now CNOC wants the oil.
3729 2018-02-11 23:06:12 Baby got a wash, full tank and an oil change 
3730 2018-02-11 23:06:04 Missed his calling as a snake oil salesman - a snake for sure
3731 2018-02-11 23:06:02 That’s a good thing. These expos are just about selling snake oil to people, not health or wellness. It’s a marketing scam.
3732 2018-02-11 23:05:52 @GordonRamsay does adding olive oil to boiling noodles keep them from sticking once you drain them in a strainer???? Needing to settle a war in my house hold. Thanks.
3733 2018-02-11 23:05:35 Well find me the $$$$ to get elected and I will change the world.  I’m not democrat or republic. I’m American. And unlike our current LOBBYIST FUNDED congress. I want to be funded by the people. I want to REPRESENT THOSE WHO VOTED FOR ME. Not oil,pharma, or some party.
3734 2018-02-11 23:04:43 hello!  i was curious as to ur thoughts on oil here: saw a few of my fav fintwit guys say we should see a small bounce before it comes crashing down again
3735 2018-02-11 23:04:37 @rich415Media when did @KGO  start airing snake oil sales programs #VitaminD #fishoil #FDA
3736 2018-02-11 23:04:30 OIL BRENT US$62.8/bbl -2.07%. UK Oilfields Restarting As Forties Pipeline Gradually Ramps Up.
3737 2018-02-11 23:04:21 Surely the Saudi owns half of Washinghton, even if they did 9/11 , let's keep them as our Oil buddy! And attack countries that didn't attack us, for minerals and opium! Also let's bomb Niger they have Uranium
3738 2018-02-11 23:03:58 What’s oil with that foundation 
3739 2018-02-11 23:03:58 That is a good point. The population grew by about 30% from 1995 (5.75m) to 2015 (7.55m), global oil consumption seems to have grown by about 150%.
3740 2018-02-11 23:03:37 Truffle salt. May still be a bit pricey, but way less I think than the oil.
3741 2018-02-11 23:03:35 I can’t say I’ve used coconut oil, might give that a go but I put Vaseline on every night and now I don’t bother with mascara 
3742 2018-02-11 23:03:33 this olbus oil is STRONG
3743 2018-02-11 23:03:26 i always wind up making friends who pray to beard oil

3746 2018-02-11 23:03:14 I had a stroke the end of November prior to Thanksgiving. The reason for the silence on Twitter.  I've been put on Statins and BP meds.  I was eating Zero Carb and almost Carnivore.  I am scared to eat that way anymore.  No more Coconut Oil with the high cholesterol.
3747 2018-02-11 23:03:10 Yes,but more importantly, let’s talk about what Chiropractors are not: medical doctors.
Chiropractors are essentially combinations of massage therapists and snake oil salesmen.
3748 2018-02-11 23:03:04 I left my sleep mask and lavender oil downstairs and now I can’t sleep
guess who’s not waking up tomorrow
3749 2018-02-11 23:03:02 And we will pay dearly for the $10 per paycheck down the road...slashed programs, cutting agency staffing, shrinking public lands. But corporations will prosper, more oil & gas drilling, zombie coal companies will rise again, but ordinary workers' bonuses have ended.
3750 2018-02-11 23:02:53  good from you. Support Banbury to be honest just waiting for an oil merchant to pump some money in. They also don’t play pub football
3751 2018-02-11 23:02:52 Yeah I have! It’s actually my favourite of the entire range! It didn’t sting my eyes but they got blurry if I got it into my eyes because of the oil...
3752 2018-02-11 23:02:45 put some tea tree oil on it, it makes them come to the surface! just give it around a day or so!

3759 2018-02-11 23:02:07 With all due respect for a human, you lack tolerance. I’m a teacher. I treat all kids with respect. It’s too bad the adults don’t behave the same way. The minute an adult is called out he/she results to bullying. Just bc I disagree w you, I don’t lack logic. That’s not flawed.
3760 2018-02-11 23:01:45 The honour and yet another reunion are two different things.
3761 2018-02-11 23:01:36 Good effin Lord the arab dude just cooked with a river of oil again and the entire house reeks of it... I don't have the strength to enter the kitchen to check... That's a problem for the me of tomorrow.. screw it
3762 2018-02-11 23:01:13 America's goal in Syria includes: regime change, partition, the expulsion of Russia and the securing of oil fields and pipeline routes.
3763 2018-02-11 23:01:06 I just hate the process of doing it entirely lol, yesterday when I was frying pickles oil was popping all over my damn hands and arms
3764 2018-02-11 23:00:42 Gotta flat iron my ends and oil my hair then wrap it. Rain and months with no perm don’t mix
3765 2018-02-11 23:00:38 Pemex Focuses on Infrastructure Improvements to Bolster Oil Output
3766 2018-02-11 23:00:38 No. Lack of oil feed. They needed revs to get the oil to the camshafts. Then what people did was to adjust the tappets and this then made it worse.
3767 2018-02-11 23:00:36 Fun fact: You produce almost no oil after a certain amount of time if you don't wash it. Way that the body adapts (this is for people in the army and on the battlefield)
3768 2018-02-11 23:00:30 I would LOVE an air fryer. Tired of having to discard of old oil when I do fry stuff
3769 2018-02-11 23:00:24 Who are the 11% twits who say no?

Send to me.  I’ll operate on them

Send them to the dustman for legal advice.

Send them to a snake oil salesman for economic advice.
3770 2018-02-11 23:00:02 lol stay on point Bruh. We’re talking oil tankers not; navy boats, shipping boats, or ferries. 
Your pathetic argument is just that, pathetic.
3771 2018-02-11 22:59:57 I hope you’re joking. The Russian government has come to agreement with the Syrian government that private military contractors like Wagner get to keep 25% of the revenue from any oil, gas or mining operations they recover from opposition forces. The goal of this assault was gas.
3772 2018-02-11 22:59:35 Facism knows no bounds. Oil company money own this rag?
3773 2018-02-11 22:59:07 Konti nalang midnight change oil ka na :)
3774 2018-02-11 22:59:03 What happens in white people's lives that they become a whole ass adult and don't know how to cook? One of my friends dead ass almost cooked chicken with no oil and no seasoning before I stopped her.

3783 2018-02-11 22:57:50 If he comes back from his injury, he won't be an issue whatsoever. If not, it's a problem but one that can't be pinned on anyone. Injuries happen.
3784 2018-02-11 22:57:48 Lmao guess who only applied sun screen once but used a shit ton of tanning oil
3785 2018-02-11 22:57:42 Very odd how J.T. hates the oil industry so much when his grandfather amassed his fortune from the oil and mining industries. Oil Industry was very lucrative for Trudeaus. They've been living off Grandpa's profits ever since

3788 2018-02-11 22:57:10 This knotted-up mess goes back to the early 50s when the West overthrew a duly-elected Gov't in Iran. If there was no oil in Iran? Nobody would give a damn. But there is, & they've been F'ed with forever. Now, it's all endless violence & both sides yelling "They hit us, first!"
3789 2018-02-11 22:57:03 I want control to be exerted by them. I would hope they leave the remaining oil where it is.
3790 2018-02-11 22:56:52 just... just get the castor oil, syd. get the castor oil
3791 2018-02-11 22:56:45 Potbelly is the new OIL
3792 2018-02-11 22:56:43 The only thing that's scary in that gag is how fucked up the lady's skin will be in the morning when literally all the oil has been sucked out of it.
3793 2018-02-11 22:56:42 I know you’re technically not supposed to apply tea tree oil directly on your skin because it’s a carrier oil but I do cos it feels so good. Am I wrong for this?
3794 2018-02-11 22:56:32 "Can't understand why they're pissed, we're just hangin' by these oil fields drinkin' some brews"
3795 2018-02-11 22:56:24 But if you add oil to water... is the water oily or is the oil wet?
3796 2018-02-11 22:56:22 mom: did u have a name for ur car?
me: jitty bugg
mom: aww that’s so cute..rest in motor oil jitty bugg 

3797 2018-02-11 22:55:48 Don’t try to do makeup after drinking. Just sprayed argon oil on my face thinking it was face setting spray.
3798 2018-02-11 22:55:47 Buy some while you’re there. I regret not getting olive oil when I was in Greece.
3799 2018-02-11 22:55:37 I am fine with tax increases. I am not fine with tax increases on the citizens of OK while the oil and gas industry continue getting breaks. Our state government is a joke.
3800 2018-02-11 22:55:33 It sounds exactly like the old snake oil merchant to me
3801 2018-02-11 22:55:29 what about #oil?
3802 2018-02-11 22:54:58 I’m just gonna say that my future husband is amazing. He’s always taking care of me. Oil change and new tires for me 
3803 2018-02-11 22:54:41 Why wouldn’t that be as ubiquitous as, say, metros in every major city? I know infrastructure is more oil tanker than speedboat but resource stress and climate change impacts have been mainstream for 2 decades now
3804 2018-02-11 22:54:36 Where did you get "supposedly despise" from? I drive a truck, I'm a miner, I have a track car, etc. I have obvious uses for oil. My point is about changing things (hence trading the truck for electric) and slowing while we are only this far behind.
3805 2018-02-11 22:54:27 The oil on the chicken drips down and pools around the sprouts so not the most healthy, probably in the same ballpark
3806 2018-02-11 22:54:16 Remainers don't live in Narnia. Every industry tellling you you're wrong. The future of the country is not safe with your side. Brexit dying on the pyre of its own contradictions and the intellectual joke peddled by its snake oil selling champions.
3807 2018-02-11 22:54:00 That bio oil is really working under my eyes x
3808 2018-02-11 22:53:52 Oil of Oregano is an anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-parasitic, anti-tussive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory. It kills nearly everything. Research it! Up to 5 drops under tongue 3x day. Although Trump could use 15,000 drops a day.

*Do not use if pregnant.
3809 2018-02-11 22:53:49 There are people to whom truth is as distasteful as a dose of cod liver oil. Many of them have been elected to national public office. Shame! #PoliticsToday

3814 2018-02-11 22:52:52 Even if the oil ought the match, his screams mixed in with the crowd, Felix appreciated them. Gave him the spirit to push hard and win his first match.
3815 2018-02-11 22:52:30 We are free to buy our oil from wherever we want, you don't get to decide on what we spend our money on ; And insults and temper tantrums are not gonna change anything. Its BC thats landlocking you, not Quebec.
3816 2018-02-11 22:52:11 Melanin protects us from the sun. Also, Black people tend to have more oil glands than other race, giving us naturally moisturized skin that reduces the signs of aging. Genetically, we are the fountain of youth.
3817 2018-02-11 22:52:05 Wm treats us as servants and uses our oil but does not allow a say in brexit so why do you  vote lab or cons are you really a scot
3818 2018-02-11 22:51:40 You clearly believe this roster is far better than it actually is and that's fine. Also, remember they have to give to get and that is something the GM does not excel at.

3823 2018-02-11 22:51:02 Gonna put tea tree oil on mine and see wah gwaan cuz me nah tek it out.
3824 2018-02-11 22:50:53 I usually marinate mine overnite in olive oil, sweet basil, pressed garlic and Parmesan cheese. Last minute deal only marinating for 3 hours.
3825 2018-02-11 22:50:53 So CBD oil update: went and check some out and as soon as I get some cash saved up I’m gonna get some. Prolly later this month 
3826 2018-02-11 22:50:51 I don’t know... sounds like burnt toast with olive oil
3827 2018-02-11 22:50:33 For the record, Cyan smells heavily of coconut oil and dragonfruit extract. Don't ask him where he got the extract.

3829 2018-02-11 22:50:15 Wargame scenario: A resource-rich, sovereign state secretly accumulates a censorship resistent cryptocurrency and then annouces they only accept crypto for oil. Price expoldes, they have huge windfall. Why wouldn't they do that?

3831 2018-02-11 22:50:11 Isis was defeated by policies started under Obama. 

Do you not understand what "conflict of interest" is? You think a guy who works for Exxon & has dedicated their life to making money from oil should be allowed to dictate environmental policy?
3832 2018-02-11 22:49:50 I’d go Loram.  Wiggy ruled out due to engine (Jawa) oil (pj1) and leathers.  Hans ruled out as he was a BN man.
3833 2018-02-11 22:49:48 Tired of seeing the words "actually think" in relation to repub legislators & climate change denials. They publicly disavow it because they're catering to corporations & big oil, but you know they privately believe scientists.

Thinking they're stupid misses the bigger picture.
3834 2018-02-11 22:49:43 my skin care routine is stop putting coconut oil on ya face & start ingesting it instead + garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue. trust me

3838 2018-02-11 22:49:15 Every government makes out it is new but overall what we see is continuity: the same snake oil solutions; the same underlying economic biases in favour of the few not the many; the same close ties to big business.

3841 2018-02-11 22:49:03 Tijuana le pregunté a AMLO que si recuperaría el petroleo (ya que en sus mitins no toca el petroleo) y me dijo: "el petroleo es de los Mexicanos" pero no supe interpretar su respuesta Dr. @AlfredoJalifeR_ que me quiso decir el PG? si o no? usted qué dice? si EUA acepta adiós OIL?
3842 2018-02-11 22:49:00 oh!イル
3843 2018-02-11 22:48:59 That's what I'm thinking. I think for *low porosity*  hair we need to just use a light leave in, with an oil, then just add the gel. It's already enough moisture within the gel. ESPECIALLY because of the BC oil and shea butter.
3844 2018-02-11 22:48:57 i finally got some more sesame oil
it can take a long time to get sesame oil 
sometimes it takes millions of years
3845 2018-02-11 22:48:56 Oh you mean like when Obama threw millions away trying to justify Ferguson and the Oil spill in the gulf? #obama=worstpresidentever
3846 2018-02-11 22:48:43 Anyone use Jojoba oil? Thinking about getting some.
3847 2018-02-11 22:48:42 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
3848 2018-02-11 22:48:40 Ojeleye’s mama put too much palm oil in the egusi. This sloppy nigga sucks
3849 2018-02-11 22:48:35 What method do you use to know if your oil (grease) is hot enough to fry (chicken, fish, pork etc)?
3850 2018-02-11 22:48:33 I'll slice it into steaks and bbq with garlic oil tonight
3851 2018-02-11 22:48:24 I'll slice it into steaks and bbq with garlic oil tonight
3852 2018-02-11 22:47:39 Who needs to do any of that? Just live down an oil top road and you'll have more dogs and cats than you know what to do with and the SO tells you to kill them cause they don't have an animal control officer in the county.
3853 2018-02-11 22:47:31 Nig Political elite has so traumatised the youth and perfected the art of improverishing them. I read a report that says at least 99% of the people in the UK don't go to bed hungry so u see why politicians in the UK can't entice voters with material things(garri,rice,oil etc).
3854 2018-02-11 22:47:18 I bid -$23 on the Lowe jersey
3855 2018-02-11 22:47:10 In a discussion (in the sense of the Spanish cognate) on Friday in CDMX with a French sociology professor at El Colegio de México, I was firmly told: "It is not your place to propose a 2nd national oil company in Mexico."
3856 2018-02-11 22:47:09 You’ve just suggested that oil revenue should be owned by the public purse....
3857 2018-02-11 22:47:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Zach
3858 2018-02-11 22:46:56 I think it has to do with oil absorbed by the bag vs the cup.
3859 2018-02-11 22:46:52 In all reality if the Saudis didn't have most of the oil reserves in the world the western powers to be wouldn't be so subservient to them. It's basically all by chance - where certain cultures settled and where certain ideologies have evolved and permeated
3860 2018-02-11 22:46:49 @Michaelamoodii sis what castor oil you use
3861 2018-02-11 22:46:47 If you suffer from oily skin, use a clay mask once a week to remove excess oil while opening & clearing out pores.
3862 2018-02-11 22:46:40 I need an Aloe Vera plant and some Vitamin E oil
3863 2018-02-11 22:46:37 あの年に生まれた子が成人する、と…     あ、ああ……（ぐにゃああ
3864 2018-02-11 22:46:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
3865 2018-02-11 22:46:28 
3866 2018-02-11 22:46:22 With the knowledge of oil flowing from the head you must know who you’re under and why .
3867 2018-02-11 22:46:15 truly..6000 mile rule has always worked for our cars. It's not like oil changes are super expensive,
3868 2018-02-11 22:46:12 Coconut oil saving lives 
3869 2018-02-11 22:46:07 As is money, oil, gold and every source of wealth..
3870 2018-02-11 22:45:55 The Soviets provided essential oil and minerals for the German war-effort, 1939-41, while Britain stood alone against Germany. Something for us (not them) to be proud of. As long as you aren’t a windy nationalist.
3871 2018-02-11 22:45:54 Mixed with coconut oil in the pan & a dash of sugar...then sautéed veggies on flat bread with lemon sauce, cant eat it alone...
3872 2018-02-11 22:45:53 It works andddd if they send the oil treatment stuff for oil pulling you’re double winning
3873 2018-02-11 22:45:47 Your point? You think the Scottish public should benefit from oil revenues? My challenge was they should keep it in the ground (seabed)
3874 2018-02-11 22:45:36 @TommyGunsBarber for all my shaving, beard oil and men’s grooming needs. Wicked selection and friendly knowledgeable staff.
3875 2018-02-11 22:45:28 Because the GOP is rubber stamping lots of things hidden in fine print of bills. He just opened Big Bear to mining and oil companies without local authority input.
3876 2018-02-11 22:45:23 A right couple of snake oil salesmen.
3877 2018-02-11 22:45:14 またエンジンOilの中にガソリン臭いするし、エンジンOil増加しています。ボクどうすればいいですか？本田さん返事お待ちしております。
3878 2018-02-11 22:44:59 'Babies breakdown all the time'
'My baby doesnt work, can I return it?'
'When a car breaks down it leaks oil. When a baby breaks down it leaks shit'
3879 2018-02-11 22:44:55 @UK_CBD_OIL Hey, we have tried to contact you via email but cannot get a response, please can you contact us? It's nothing to worry about. Kind regards, Hempura.
3880 2018-02-11 22:44:51 I’d do that myself in all honestly. I have oily skin and don’t want to look greasy. Keep the natural oil at bay with powder and then add shine on top so I (hopefully) don’t look too caked.
3881 2018-02-11 22:44:32 The internal combustion engine is done. Alternative to adblue for euro6 diesel regs requires new civic diesel to need oil change every 6250 miles. It’s gone backwards!
3882 2018-02-11 22:44:29 I wouldn’t describe oil revenues as icing on the cake. I’d describe them as the complete opposite.
3883 2018-02-11 22:44:07 เค้าชอบไดโนเสาร์ แต่รอน้องก่อนว่าน้องชอบตัวไหน???
3884 2018-02-11 22:43:58 Sad because i just changed my oil a week ago and now i have to change it again

3887 2018-02-11 22:42:51 i love avocado oil cause you can’t really taste it
3888 2018-02-11 22:42:38 Thank you sir. Ab Mandir ke bahar all unemployed youth of Abu Dhabi will sell pakoras  and earn livelihood and his coming generations will surely buy some oil fields in future . What say @navinbit
3889 2018-02-11 22:42:10 Ask the residents of Lac Magantic Quebec how they feel about oil moved by diesel burning trains. Pipelines move infinately more oil than trains. That's why they get built or oil companies would have only used rail since tanker cars were invented.They don't build pipelines for fun
3890 2018-02-11 22:42:07 Tradingp7:They used heating oil for hedge of inputs and grains for output, forward contracted, basis and speculated.
3891 2018-02-11 22:42:06 this is what they said so. I believe söme illegal things happened on the ground, operated by CIA staff, like the one in  Nicaragua. This time ISIS oil trade for supporting Arab Spring. Why not???
3892 2018-02-11 22:41:58 Oil. The issue is the white is bare gesso. How will it take the varnish? It will change the gloss & matte to uniform gloss. Is that a good thing? How will gesso age without varnish? I'm leaning towards no varnish right now.
3893 2018-02-11 22:41:57 Is the press conference at Lucas Oil like Mcdaniels was going to be, or is it at 56th street now?
3894 2018-02-11 22:41:57 Good luck man #GoFastStraightandSafe #keeppartsinside
3895 2018-02-11 22:41:57 Ummm, this round has already been completed.
3896 2018-02-11 22:41:49 ate hummus today. 1st ingredient was lettuce? second was...oil?
3897 2018-02-11 22:41:46 It was obviously prepared before the result bro,dnt you see the cloth they r wearing, was it sown at night joke of a state
3898 2018-02-11 22:41:28 Rub with a bit of oil, might take a bit longer! 
3899 2018-02-11 22:41:25 I had some truffle popcorn Friday and thought I can make that. Went to Publix and looked for truffle oil...it was $13. I’ll keep eating regular ass popcorn.
3900 2018-02-11 22:41:18 Hallelujah!! The Oil & Fire of God the flows through His House... :o 
3901 2018-02-11 22:41:00 You are aware that Norway is the 15th largest oil producer in the world?
3902 2018-02-11 22:40:49 This oil feels amazing on my scalp!
3903 2018-02-11 22:40:43 本田新車2016 civic 2.0アメリカFLで買ったアが、半年でエンジンとマフラー接続所に酷いOil漏れました、販売店に行って話しましたが問題ではありません、故障ではありません、エンジンのタップ交換すれば大丈夫といいました、自分が気が済まず、9000ドル損して、新しい2017本田civic1.5T買いましたが、

3906 2018-02-11 22:39:51 Venezuela is a communist country FYI, they put all their eggs in one basket selling oil, the country went bankrupt and its people have no food, I have friends that live there and I talk to them on a regular basis,fleeing the country to Columbia, my friends are headed to Chile

3909 2018-02-11 22:39:37 It’s the simple things... made Zara noodles with Sesame oil for dinner... “they’re brilliant daddy, well done.” And a hug 
3910 2018-02-11 22:39:26 Ur WCW put up a snap of her dashboard and the road while she was driving and listening to music on her way to a night out. Her check engine light is on. Her last oil change was 9 months ago.
3911 2018-02-11 22:38:59 I’m very serious about declarations this weekend. So my next declaration 

I’m obsessed with avocado oil.  

Ok thx!
3912 2018-02-11 22:38:42 Lola: Please pass the owel. 
Me: Wait. Owel, what?

Huhu. Oil pala, gaise.

3914 2018-02-11 22:38:26 It’s so much snow outside but I really need to buy some coconut oil 
3915 2018-02-11 22:38:18 48 points in 50 games so far. Hardly Drai's fault. How many point per game players are there in the league right now? ;-)
3916 2018-02-11 22:38:12 The point is they paid into the system with their money. They’re not “leeching off the system”. Walmart, big oil and other corporations are leeching off the system with the billions we pay in subsidies. Go bitch where it counts.
3917 2018-02-11 22:38:03 United spurs and Arsenal are no better. City are the benchmark but they have a country with oil behind them. I love what Klopp is building. Your unrealistic if you think we can buy the best in world football .
3918 2018-02-11 22:37:58 Just so you know.....there are illegals working in the oil patch at $36.00/hour! 
3919 2018-02-11 22:37:48 Baby oil smell like babies. Can u believe that
3920 2018-02-11 22:37:14 I appreciate that for an anrcho-communist rapeseed oil might be a bit bourgois. My trade unionist Dad would agree with you.
3921 2018-02-11 22:37:05 This is greenwashing. Please stop promoting hydrogen economy stuff. It's just an oil company scam.
3922 2018-02-11 22:36:44 After i go get my oil chamge i might hit the gym but i doubt  it my energy eill run iut eventually
3923 2018-02-11 22:36:32 JUST GOT OLBAS OIL IN MY EYE
3924 2018-02-11 22:36:24 Is the press conference at Lucas Oil like Mcdaniels was going to be or is it at 56th street?
3925 2018-02-11 22:36:17 Coconut oil!
3926 2018-02-11 22:35:59 No, just slice, lightly toss in olive oil & garlic salt or sea salt

3932 2018-02-11 22:35:08 I once made pasta using Rapeseed oil and sang "Rapeseed" to the same tune including "i'm not the only oil, nononononono"

My girlfriend was not impressed.
3933 2018-02-11 22:34:55 I drink my coffee black man, how much oil do you recommend?
3934 2018-02-11 22:34:45 Were oil revenues part of the plan for indy Scotland. And I’m no britnat...
3935 2018-02-11 22:34:39 by dampening beforehand the mask is no longer porous, thus doesn’t absorb the product but instead its distributed evenly. texture of the “serum” is v fluid and resembles water rather than oil, which is why it can be hard to apply and feel wasteful. hope that clears up the logic.
3936 2018-02-11 22:34:30 whale oil beef hoofreddie @ dying
3937 2018-02-11 22:34:21 Jamaican black castor oil works wonders
3938 2018-02-11 22:33:15 Beat me to it. $6 for a tiny bucket of chips done in oil that hasn't been changed since Charlie Yankos hit that famous goal v Argentina
3939 2018-02-11 22:33:13 Olive Oil, Salt and Pepper. Pretty tasty.
3940 2018-02-11 22:33:12 Candlelit bath with oat milk, coconut and essential oils run by little dearest one and from @ARC_Bytes Great Ovens Heath a single call of tawny oil through the bathroom window calls @TheGreatHeath will he find a mate soon?
3941 2018-02-11 22:32:58 Lmfao you left out the part where I said the tacos tasted like fryer oil armpits 
3942 2018-02-11 22:32:57 If there was a bigger and more relatable mood than this rn I stg— got an essential oil nice smelling thing this week that has me covered in hives real bad so I feel you fam and I’m sorry for you that’s ass
3943 2018-02-11 22:32:29 I am so sick of government corruption  "If we had the government structure we have now, the whale blubber oil guys would have paid off the government to make sure that electricity never happened" – Dylan Ratigan
3944 2018-02-11 22:32:25 Tea tree oil  works wonders. Preferably the Desert Essence one. You can get it at wegmans
3945 2018-02-11 22:32:14 @getnickwright must watch Lebron games with the lights dimmed and smooth R&B playing.  Baby Oil and tissue strategically placed within arms reach.  Not the best ever dude
3946 2018-02-11 22:32:12 Eeeeeesshhh, that looks painful, hope you have super speedy recovery

Helpful tip: use ‘Bio Oil’ on the scar, it’ll help it fade, worked wonders for me when I burnt my face with an oven tray
3947 2018-02-11 22:32:07 i think the operative word here is 'started'. if Salman happens to be as bold as UAE's Zayed/ Khalifa while reducing the kingdom's dependence on oil, SAR depeg offers decent r:r
3948 2018-02-11 22:31:53 01:30 @LeoDiCaprio It's Leo. Ryan, have U bought red palm oil yet?
3949 2018-02-11 22:31:47 Yes it is, It brought My Memory Back and my Cognitive Ability, Fish oil B4 Bed helps best!
3950 2018-02-11 22:31:43 Also did a batch with coconut oil for my xmas cookies as I have a lot of vegan friends - worked great.
3951 2018-02-11 22:31:32 DJGJHGJ Fr tho I want to oil my boys scalp and give him that good treatment, the stylists are out for him. Him and Yoons both be balding, I need to be out to help and protect my mans
3952 2018-02-11 22:31:31 If finding oil in the north in this era that the rest of the world is shifting away from it will bring an end to the senseless killings of innocent Nigerians,  may oil be found in large commercial quantity in the north..
3953 2018-02-11 22:31:19 I just took a coconut oil bath and did a body sugar scrub my skin feels amazing.
3954 2018-02-11 22:31:17 Why is this not live? First event of the new season and it's taped. Unacceptable.
3955 2018-02-11 22:31:00 Coconut oil in your coffee is a game changer
3956 2018-02-11 22:30:51 Ez recipe for younger, clear, flawless face.  Mix 1 Tablespoon of Pure aloe vera gel,5 drops of coconut or olive oil, 1tbs of turmeric, touch of lemon. Apply and let it dry. Then, rub well in a circular motion without water. Rinse with cool water.
3957 2018-02-11 22:30:50 01:29 @LeoDiCaprio It's Leo. Len didn't take sunflowers oil more than a year in Mexico, got horror in all her body.
3958 2018-02-11 22:30:21 In melbourne we have optimum conditions for coconut oil, 9 months of the year. 
3959 2018-02-11 22:30:13 ....idk what bio oil even is lmao
3960 2018-02-11 22:30:12 The only challenge is finding the RHD puck mover. Every other move is a fairly easy fix.
3961 2018-02-11 22:30:03 They find truffles which you turn into truffle oil :)
3962 2018-02-11 22:29:57 Between the candles, wall plug ins, oil diffusers, and wax melts that me and @swimmerangelaky have, our house will smell like a lavender vanilla tranquil garden spa during the holidays with blue ocean waves. And I’m okay with that
3963 2018-02-11 22:29:43 Snake oil convention featuring child murderer. I'm guessing there will be fortune tellers too.
3964 2018-02-11 22:29:27 01:28 @LeoDiCaprio It's Leo. I like butter&sunflowers oil. Ryan, was in Mexico sunflowers1?
3965 2018-02-11 22:29:18 Venezuela no puede movilizar tropa a ningún lado.  No tiene oil para aviones, ni para movilizar infantería, tropa esta sin alimentos, y el 80%  Quieren irse de baja, de las 4 fuerzas.  De allí la súplica de Maduro al Papa comunista para que interceda por él.  Plomo al hampa
3966 2018-02-11 22:29:17 I tried lol i had to use oil
3967 2018-02-11 22:29:17 Containment booms off the coast of California because oil is spewing out of the ocean floor. Why not try to gather it responsibly by catching it from the source?
3968 2018-02-11 22:29:08 موجودين فى فرح
3969 2018-02-11 22:29:08 I think we all predicted this. Next up: oil spill #sabotage #naturaldisaster
3970 2018-02-11 22:29:06 Hot I got you oil from your ass
3971 2018-02-11 22:29:03 i have not seen light ones anywhere, and they will go a lovely dark colour as they age.... dont forget to treat them with boot oil / leather oil  i have some for my biker boots
3972 2018-02-11 22:28:54 He isn’t injured, he’s getting up to speed which takes time.
3973 2018-02-11 22:28:54 I have been under 156 before. Last time I did it was to show a driver where the oil leak was, so that he could isolate the engine and take me home.
3974 2018-02-11 22:28:49 Does Venezuela have Socialism? Or is it Communism? Either way, who REALLY controls the oil? Is it Venezuela govt or an outside Oil Company?
3975 2018-02-11 22:28:32 why the fuck is tea tree oil so expensive
3976 2018-02-11 22:28:28 Andrew Scheer is GOP (Gas & Oil Party) imo. Not Made in Canada politics.
3977 2018-02-11 22:28:14 if anyone was wondering what I wanted for valentine’s day, P&J peppermint oil is all I need. please and thanks.

3979 2018-02-11 22:28:09 01:25 @LeoDiCaprio It's Leo. We saw food grapes seeds oil in store last evening. Wanted to find what it means. Means not bad.
3980 2018-02-11 22:28:02 And at least I’m considerate enough to rise it out after I grease myself up with baby oil  #slipnslide
3981 2018-02-11 22:28:00 Its coconut oil. Magic of the islands 
3982 2018-02-11 22:27:58 ...All the oil is making me think of him as a greasy business man in a suit?
3983 2018-02-11 22:27:34 Nikola Tesla saved the movie industry with his flying saucer with the infusion of oil money to support suppression of free energy. Corny flying saucer Alien movies and space travel subsist today unless more attractive mind control is available.
3984 2018-02-11 22:27:13 
3985 2018-02-11 22:27:11 remember gas stations 4 or 5 working pumping gas, wash windows even checking oil. next could find spatchila at door an sign saying pay here cook it yourself.
3986 2018-02-11 22:26:54 automobile maintenance should be a mandatory high school course. some people are just dumb........checking your oil and your tires isn't fucking rocket science, its relatively easy and can save you a lot of problems.
3987 2018-02-11 22:26:48 Pull out the baby oil and tissues bro!
3988 2018-02-11 22:26:15 3 hours at the dealer for an oil change is blasphemy !!
3989 2018-02-11 22:26:06 Using face oil/serum under my makeup has been helping so much 
3990 2018-02-11 22:26:03 That oil from the heavens... #TeaTreeOil 
3991 2018-02-11 22:25:59 drink water and oil your edges everyday.  Don't be mad at my glo up
3992 2018-02-11 22:25:57 85% of soya beans are crushed for oil. Can you please explain how the majority of soya meal that is used for animal feed is not a by product of oil production.
3993 2018-02-11 22:25:46 Interesting how you need an unnamed “enemy”. Big Pharma.  Big Oil. Always somebody to blame.  Never personal responsibility for anything.
3994 2018-02-11 22:25:46 01:24 @LeoDiCaprio It's Leo. Palm oil is very harmful for health,every scientist will say U, but there's selected red1, who knows..
3995 2018-02-11 22:25:31 Oil and money.
3996 2018-02-11 22:25:20 IT IS A SHAME THAN FOR SOME PEOPLE TO BE NORMAL THE GENOCIDE OF USA AND ISRAEL AGAINST COUNTRIES "BY DEMOCRACY" (FOR OIL...)
3997 2018-02-11 22:25:17 This is your dummest idea ever and that’s saying a lot. This is pure drivel. Your followers are being deceived by your snake oil and it’s dangerously irresponsible. I don’t think you know what game theory means and I would question your expertise on anything.

3999 2018-02-11 22:24:47 Olive oil prices give me anxiety.
4000 2018-02-11 22:24:31 vegetable & canola oil is the worst oils to cook with. period. i only cook with extra virgin olive oil, sunflower or avocado oil. do your own research.
4001 2018-02-11 22:24:30 Keep some good fats in your diet? Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, grape seed oil, avocado.. Mmmm
4002 2018-02-11 22:24:28 We watched @QueerEye yesterday and this morning Houston spent 3 hours shopping and wants to use beard oil. God bless this show!
4003 2018-02-11 22:24:21 Rosehip oil is actually pure magic  my skin is fucking glowing
4004 2018-02-11 22:23:53 Ok. So is he who we sue when the first Oil Spill occurs?? I say YUP
4005 2018-02-11 22:23:47 That frying oil should have been changed last year.
4006 2018-02-11 22:23:42 haha luckily I usually like this kind of things (liver, brain, heart, in Italy they cook them all together thin cut with olive oil, garlic and olives, with a bit of white wine - hope Simona is not reading ). I'm very curious about this almond sauce
4007 2018-02-11 22:23:32 Ο Θοδωρής αλειφτηκε με baby oil ?#survivorGR
4008 2018-02-11 22:23:18 As usual, @SecretaryZinke's "backward-looking approach puts oil & gas profits first & will place our coastal communities & all they support at risk of the next BP-style disaster," #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround Support #RenewableEnergy @Interior @BOEM_DOI @EnergyGOP @EnergyDems
4009 2018-02-11 22:23:12 If that is your theory put it on everything then and not just one specific item. This was a direct attack on renewable energy that his administration is trying to destroy in favor of big oil and gas companys.

4011 2018-02-11 22:22:28 @AaronHimmlerATC went outside to change the oil on my car at halftime. Bearcats are now up 30. Should I tell him to stay in the garage?
4012 2018-02-11 22:22:12 Yeah hmu Ima do n oil change on the whip real quick
4013 2018-02-11 22:21:51 I'm craving a medium well steak smothered in sauteed mushrooms and onions with red potato wedges and cauliflower baked with olive oil and garlic and roasted asparagus 
4014 2018-02-11 22:21:48 It takes 3 extra minutes to produce a more consistent oil. You could've also left it in the sunlight for a hour or two to remove chlorophyll from it.
4015 2018-02-11 22:21:45 I'll give you a full body oil massage to let all your worries go away with scented candles & relaxing music
4016 2018-02-11 22:21:38 Next watch KSA playing kissy face w Russia. If state-owned oil co goes public,Russia & China interested in buying into it. My guess is KSA will soon start accepting more forms of payment than US petro $. That's prob why US so upset w Russia.
4017 2018-02-11 22:21:37 WHY INDIAN OIL CORPN IS HELPLESS IN CONTROLLING CORRUPTION IN ALL PETROL PUMPS OF HARYANA TOURISM GIVING SHORT DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS BY MINIMUM 300 ML AGAINST 5 LTR SUPPORTED BY THEIR SALES OFFICERS & ENGENEERING TEAM? WHY AUTOMATION RECORD IS NOT CHECKED TO CONTROL CORRUPTION?

4020 2018-02-11 22:20:11 Robbie from fair city. His hair. What's the story. Is it doused in used oil from a deep fat fryer or brylcreem? #FairCity
4021 2018-02-11 22:20:05 You might want to go straight to oil or wax for this one
4022 2018-02-11 22:19:48 Today I'll be making #keto marshmellows, possibly keto hush puppies, and maybe either shrimp oil or broche rolls
4023 2018-02-11 22:19:40 Put coconut oil on my face and feel good
4024 2018-02-11 22:19:39 bought my first @LushLtd products last week and my hair has honestly never felt better. the "BIG" sea salt shampoo & jason and the argan oil shampoo bar are heaven sent. so so good.

4027 2018-02-11 22:19:07 Admittedly it’s hard to resist the urge to offer suggestions on how to safely get stoned without being paranoid, but I have to remember that chronic pain people have already investigated every snake oil remedy including literal snake oil.
4028 2018-02-11 22:19:05 @hungryhouse ordered 2 portions of sweet potato fries and literally got a handful and the rest of the food is soggy and drenched in oil  food came 45 mins after expected time too
4029 2018-02-11 22:19:02 Oil changed and a full tank
4030 2018-02-11 22:18:59 Car all fixed, just need a oil change.
4031 2018-02-11 22:18:56 So. It' eliminates the oil drastically. If you do use any cooking spray (I hardly do) its like a quick spray or spraying the basket.
4032 2018-02-11 22:18:53 Bedtime story on channel21 levender oil on. Sleep tight

It's like calling Hillary's cabal our people!  wake up!
4039 2018-02-11 22:17:29 Honey, brown sugar, salt/pepper, soy sauce, veg oil w/ pinch of seasoned salt will make some banging honey wings 
4040 2018-02-11 22:16:56 Btw, do you do oil changes?
4041 2018-02-11 22:16:49 Candidate did something that was unthinkable 4 the current members of the Hse of Deleates,she began 2 read list of donations made by oil & gas industry 2 members of Judiciary Committee that was holding the hearing on the bill.#Fascist #Corruption #NoFreeSpeech #Lucas #Hero 
4042 2018-02-11 22:16:45 You want to fight the altright? Kneecap their financing. Oil, gas, and war.
4043 2018-02-11 22:16:43 And Amy, girl, don’t give ANY damns about this rapid growth! Some ppl think they’re a cow, but baby is just doubling up! Just use LOTS of lotion-Vit E or cocoa oil on belly, hips, breast. Helps w/elasticity repair from stretchn at that rapid rate.
4044 2018-02-11 22:16:42 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
4045 2018-02-11 22:16:41 With all due respect, for a Teacher your not very intellectual. Your arguments lack logic, rational thought. Basically lib talking points
4046 2018-02-11 22:16:34 I go to autozone for specifically oil and a filter, but I never got oil just 2 filters lol! My dad was like “wtf where is the oil!”  yeah never send me for that stuff
4047 2018-02-11 22:16:25 Have you tried lavender oil or peppermint oil you can get a little stick miagrane thing from the chemist ? It helps bad headaches xx hope you feel better 
4048 2018-02-11 22:15:34 01:14 @LeoDiCaprio It's Leo. I don't like palm oil, but just found red1. I'll try.
4049 2018-02-11 22:15:29 Not necessarily, depends on the level of heat  the oil can take, it’s apparently super easy to burn stuff in the air fryer.
4050 2018-02-11 22:15:27 I think I’m high on olbas oil.
4051 2018-02-11 22:15:16 That is really depressing. They bought snake oil from a guy who's not even good at selling snake oil... you can't even enjoy their misery because it's just sad. I really feel bad for these guys....

But only at night when they are sleep not in the same room

He is a child

He doesn't know what he likes

He needs cannabis oil

Both his father and I have mental conditions
4053 2018-02-11 22:15:07 My boyfriends mum sells it so I literally hear about it everyday... It's also my Christmas and birthday presents!! I tried one of the foundations bc I felt bad and it literally felt like I was rubbing vegetable oil on my face
4054 2018-02-11 22:14:50 I have a blog for you I wrote a while ago banging on about this. Snake oil salesmen. (cc @Natalie_KateM)
4055 2018-02-11 22:14:40 Even with oil they say you save about 70% of calories you’d eat with deep frying
4056 2018-02-11 22:14:39 That was truffle oil, and not liking truffle oil is actually very high level. The green tortilla makes you a peasant, though.
4057 2018-02-11 22:14:39 ....do we need olive oil? Lmao
4058 2018-02-11 22:14:35 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
4059 2018-02-11 22:14:22 "I'm in oil"
"Are you a sardine?"
4060 2018-02-11 22:14:21 I haven’t taken my fish oil supplements in months and I can definitely tell. My ADHD has been CRAY! I need to start taking them again.
4061 2018-02-11 22:14:20 Let’s no forget the real liberal plan of phasing out oil sands.
4062 2018-02-11 22:14:02 True! Or you can use a healthier oil
4063 2018-02-11 22:14:01 Bro are all the iPhones made like they’re cover in oil and butter? Because mine makes it’s way to the fucking floor from any surface I set it on somehow 
4064 2018-02-11 22:13:56 Why not. As long as taxpayers don’t have to subsidize these wealth 5Big Oil cos as they have been for 30yrs...it would be work for ABns. Win/Win
4065 2018-02-11 22:13:55 Smh pepboys really tricked me into paying $55 for a $22 oil change. Pretty salty not gonna lie
4066 2018-02-11 22:13:48 Hopefully you understand not much lubricant oil is needed to run a turbine? And again, we could use something else. It must be hard for you to realize we can get rid of fossils entirely. I’m sure you’ll adapt.
4067 2018-02-11 22:13:39 Move has been made. Shanghai Energy Exchange opened a few weeks ago. Russia plans 2 drop USD soon. Iraq tried to sell oil 4 euros. Libya wanted to back a pan-African currency w gold. Becomes very apparent now why they were invaded.
4068 2018-02-11 22:13:33 African Americans are not really African. Anyone born here is not an immigrant. Any educated person would know this. The statement stupid

4070 2018-02-11 22:13:15  but if you use cooking spray instead of just oil you may get away with something. Now I need in

4080 2018-02-11 22:12:33 Ah, AP will definitely make it more dense, but 100% coconut oil is a-ok regardless of brand.
4081 2018-02-11 22:12:23 Yes and Amen! He is glorious! Shine Jesus! Shine! Holy Spirit meet us in our week! Let your oil flow Lord! Anoint us! Lead us!
4082 2018-02-11 22:12:21 I'm doing it like a conditioning scalp treatment. I used 1 teaspoon tumeric to 2 tablespoons olive oil, mixed it into a thin paste and massaged it into my scalp. I'm letting it sit for ~30 minutes, then I'll wash it out with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo.
4083 2018-02-11 22:12:17 I don’t know how many of you use olive oil but holy crap that stuff is expensive lol .  #Cooking #dinner
4084 2018-02-11 22:12:14 Later we'll drive a couple of miles east on Burbank and go to a dispensary called King of Vapes... I need to get a few cannabis oil carts.
4085 2018-02-11 22:12:01 Nutella is  packed with GMO sugar and dairy & environmentally harmful palm oil
4086 2018-02-11 22:11:46 Any party that approves pipelines, uses Harper's GHG targets, proposes a weak and incomplete carbon tax, and that will still provide the oil industry with significant influence over environmental assessment doesn't have a legit climate plan. Oh wait, that is the federal Liberals.
4087 2018-02-11 22:11:45 Leaving Saudi Arabia after three amazing days.  I came with a static view of the place. I was wrong.  The move to a more liberal and inclusive society with less dependence on oil has started.  While I don’t know if it will succeed, I am certain they are going to go for it.
4088 2018-02-11 22:11:39 "opals should never be kept in oil" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAA
4089 2018-02-11 22:11:27 So Chia will trade Slepy and a second round pick for Martin then?
4090 2018-02-11 22:11:15 Those who would give up essential Mustard oil, to purchase a little temporary Pumpernickel, deserve neither Toaster strudel nor Passage.

4095 2018-02-11 22:11:07 They did try that Norway as part of Sweden thing for a while. Pre oil and IKEA, though. I may get the entire band back together at some point under my crown, like in medieval times. But for now, I really can’t be bothered.

4097 2018-02-11 22:10:58 Too bad so sad! The US government has become controlled by Big oil and their plastic products to the extent it drove truly green hemp products out of business! Shameless action by a constitutional government!

4101 2018-02-11 22:10:15 Best thing I seen on oil change was when Devan Dubnyk got a call saying he was traded. His face went beat red while on the phone, then looked at the camera and said, "I guess I just got traded"
4102 2018-02-11 22:10:13 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
4103 2018-02-11 22:09:48 you cannot get the oil...until you crush the olive. #getcrushed#Godsanointing

4105 2018-02-11 22:09:34 This is bad. On the other hand, what's the alternative? We need these jobs manned. These people run oil companies, manufacturing, farming. Important businesses that we need. 

Democrats solution is to import more labor, which is as inadequate as the Republican solution.

Tough.
4106 2018-02-11 22:09:31 niacinamide + zinc, rose hip seed oil, vitamin c 23% + 2% HA, glycolic acid toning solution, possibly the moisturizer and would be getting the AHA + BHA peeling solution if they had it in stock
4107 2018-02-11 22:09:28 And she poured oil on their hinges, and took to ask her ear to ask you look sharp after her.
4108 2018-02-11 22:09:14 Coconut oil base, olive oil, peppermint oil, rose hip oil, and organic honey 
4109 2018-02-11 22:09:11 We got lucky I guess. Never had cod liver oil either. However I do take fish oil capsules now. It’s suppose to be good for us. 
4110 2018-02-11 22:08:43 Not only was Pence rude to South Korea (an American ally). He missed an opportunity at diplomacy — but then Trumpface doesn’t know shit about diplomacy! Pence went low, when he could have gone high, and perhaps made a long term difference.

4113 2018-02-11 22:08:18 Actually I’ve  no idea what you are talking about! Are you implying we cannot have a road without oil? I say we don’t really need roads as I’m quite sure in your lifetime, you shall see “cars” hover over a “road”. World is changing dude! Get out of the way of change #innovation

4121 2018-02-11 22:07:22 I nearly bought a bit of a Tornado instrument panel but went for a Merlin engine Oil temp gauge instead  #eBay
4122 2018-02-11 22:07:18 So it is a lot healthier than normal frying because you just kinda brush oil on the food instead of soaking it in. And apparently the results are great. Obviously kinda unhealthy compared to just baking but it’s a good alternative.
4123 2018-02-11 22:07:17 You joke, but I was looking at oil radiators today  
4124 2018-02-11 22:07:12 Valentines Day is this week! I’ve attached my wish list:

Me: *Hands friend a bowl of freshly chopped romaine lettuce, radishes, and homemade Italian dressing*

Me: Add a little olive oil first
4128 2018-02-11 22:06:11 I would but it is so symptomatic of problems with society. We used to be able to both recognize and then deal with snake oil salesmen. Unfortunately, now it looks like we as a society worship them.
4129 2018-02-11 22:05:56 Dry the zoodles really well, sautee in some olive oil and garlic, top with favorite pasta sauce/gravy.  Squisita!
4130 2018-02-11 22:05:56 You seem to be having lots of problems sleeping lately. There's these pills that I've been taking since 6th grade called 'melatoniini' and they're really helpful. You can likely find them at a Walgreens near things like fish oil.
4131 2018-02-11 22:05:49 Olbas oil works
4132 2018-02-11 22:05:48 Baby oil gel before you get in the shower....thank me later
4133 2018-02-11 22:05:16 Just reverse the Hall deal, remove Lucic & this is a completely different team.
4134 2018-02-11 22:05:09 i’ve been waiting over an hour for an oil change.....
4135 2018-02-11 22:04:57 Brown MUSLIM people with no oil. 
4136 2018-02-11 22:04:54 Husky got into the trash dismorning and knocked the oil off my stove top onto the floor
4137 2018-02-11 22:04:45 With Trump not enforcing sanctions against Russia, Putin will make half a trillion (500 Billion) dollars from that much untapped oil. All pumped tax-free through Crimea, stolen from Ukraine, now owned by Russia.  
** Trump will get 19% cut.
4138 2018-02-11 22:04:38 Probably by clinging to your conservative ideals while your province collapses due to poor management over the last 30 years by one party who rode oil revenues to wins. Have fun becoming a half not province as the world stops using oil. Reset Alberta would mean a progressive prov
4139 2018-02-11 22:04:37 Ohhhhhh okay- we’re good. Racism. Our nation of immigrants. You’re Native American then?
4140 2018-02-11 22:04:30 I got a old spray bottle filled it with lavender oil and water and put a big label on it called Monster Spray. I used to go around their bedrooms spraying it under the beds and it dark corners, once all the monsters were dead they went to sleep.
4141 2018-02-11 22:04:30 Denmark is now debt free and can start planning its own infrastructures! Scotland has people like Mundell, Murdo Fraser and their WM masters to plan for us! No metro for us while our Oil is being pumped out of our ground by UK vampires
4142 2018-02-11 22:04:27 Similar analogy would be off shore drilling for oil which is common as opposed to fracking which has received some opposition in some countries.
4143 2018-02-11 22:04:26 Once told an apprentice to put the engine oil in . He did , right up to the top of the rocker cover 
4144 2018-02-11 22:03:55 He was constitutionally elected and yeah I agree Putin wants trump to use our own natural resources and make their oil reserves useless Putin wanted us to bomb that Syrian airbase pull your head out of where the Sun don't shine and open your eyes
4145 2018-02-11 22:03:30 Read emperor.
What oil did rudolph diesel design his engine to run on?
What plant based plastic,stronger than steel, rust proof etc were henry fords first cars made of and what washe growin fields of to fuel em.
Idealism is a dirty word to those devoid of imagination n cutiosity
4146 2018-02-11 22:03:24 This #CavsCeltics game says far more about how poor Boston has looked of late than Cleveland. That said, no question this Cavs team is better.
4147 2018-02-11 22:03:22 @TheRealTriscuit Cracked black pepper and Olive oil is the best Triscuit flavor by a wide margin.
4148 2018-02-11 22:03:16 Slightly amazed right now. I have had a bad tooth ache all weekend. Waiting for dentist appt this week. My mom said try peppermint oil and it really did help.  Obviously not a permanent solution but gave me a moment of relief. #EssentialOils #SmartMama #PeppermintOil
4149 2018-02-11 22:03:12 I was told that my apartment smells like “coconut oil and good decisions”

4157 2018-02-11 22:02:30 I never watched reality tv (aside from oil change) but I could get into this celebrity big brother.
4158 2018-02-11 22:02:25 Olive oil kills cancer cells, chemo kills people
4159 2018-02-11 22:01:59 Yep ... Shell is divesting much of it's oil and investing in natural gas plays ... and quite heavily in renewables. Wind, solar, battery storage and geothermal. So are other majors! It's economics, not govt policy!
4160 2018-02-11 22:01:58 I used as i am double butter cream, the eco Styler gel w the flaxseed, and a coconut oil spray. i used rollers till it dried
4161 2018-02-11 22:01:50 Trying not to be responsible for such greenhouse effects. Oil as far as I'm concerned is dead in the water. If Nigeria is smart they should focus more on agriculture. We're the second largest producer of tomatoes but the highest importer of tomato paste. Nigeria ain't woke.
4162 2018-02-11 22:01:44 it has to be oil free

4165 2018-02-11 22:01:21 CBD oil would be better. It's all the healing properties without the high. However, most seek the high and want it pot legalized and legitimized for that reason.
4166 2018-02-11 22:01:18 capitalism is asking the consumer class to ‘go green’, recycle, and turn off their lights to save the planet instead of telling the agricultural/oil industry and multi-billion corporations to cut out 99% of the shit they’re pulling every single hour of every day
4167 2018-02-11 22:01:07 Builder of ISIS is America as Supports Pyd. America supports terrorist organizations for colonists ideology.American companies wants more oil.American companies salaries to the American fake media for fake news as @nytimesworld

4170 2018-02-11 22:00:42 Lamb ragù, some type of salad, and a chocolate olive oil cake with a dark chocolate ganache. That’s the plan for Sunday dinner.
4171 2018-02-11 22:00:40 February 11, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

4174 2018-02-11 22:00:10 ALL pipelines leak. ALL of them. Within one week of flow, the Keystone LEAKED. A few million barrels.We got NOT ONE DIME from that oil! We don't have a way to commercially refine it profitably.  WE take all the risk, China gets the oil.
4175 2018-02-11 21:59:59 CBD oil tastes horrible but works better than any anti-anxiety med i’ve ever tried
4176 2018-02-11 21:59:58 THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA: Sun bathing for 30 minutes. Warm lemon drink or olive oil drink. Take natural relaxing herbs e.g ginger. Half bathe.
4177 2018-02-11 21:59:57 What is baby oil used for ? I just bought Ivan some and tbh I don't even know how to use it 
4178 2018-02-11 21:59:52 Maple syrup is 30x the price of oil 
4179 2018-02-11 21:59:39 @VP So selfies with oil coated, bare chested, hot guys in skirts is OK but lunch with Nancy Pelosi would be sinful?
4180 2018-02-11 21:59:37 ME (trying to be nice): How are things going at the oil place, Jim?
JIM (correcting me like an asshole): Well.
ME (drawing my lightsaber): WHATEVER ASSHOLE
4181 2018-02-11 21:59:36 Getting flashbacks to oil three years ago
4182 2018-02-11 21:59:32 Me too ! Especially the castor oil
4183 2018-02-11 21:59:22 It could be a joint army of Syrians once Daesh is defeated. Really folk, you could work out a deal on oil and some autonomy, representation. Wouldn't that be better than 200,000 more dead?
4184 2018-02-11 21:59:20 NIGERIANS SHOULD BE AWARDED BEST SPEAKERS OF MUMBO-JUMBO IF THEY ARE YET TO CONSTRUCT THEIR REFINERIES!HOW WOULD A NATION BLESSED WITH OIL CONTINUE TO IMPORT REFINED OIL?BUHARI CAN'T SUBSIDIZE ,BUHARI CAN'T CONSTRUCT REFINERIES!NONSENSE!
4185 2018-02-11 21:59:15 Get a battery powered one. I recommend the eGo brand that you can get at Home Depot, works amazing. No gas, no oil, no smell, just charge in 30 min and go
4186 2018-02-11 21:59:07 Just a basic mineral oil so that its food safe for use in the kitchen. Other more general projects tend to get teak or danish oil
4187 2018-02-11 21:59:02 i just put rose hip oil on my face, tr*ye is shaking

4189 2018-02-11 21:58:03 Olive oil yw
4190 2018-02-11 21:58:03 Yeah, linseed oil was always the go-to for old school CrMo protection

4192 2018-02-11 21:57:39 Did you know::  The worlds oldest person attributed her ripe old age (122) to a diet of olive oil, port wine and 1 kg of chocolate per week.
4193 2018-02-11 21:56:49 I love my man, I really do. But damn! His body oil that he got from this one cat, smells bloody awful.
4194 2018-02-11 21:56:32 Norway is like the Hail Mary of all countries. Saved all its oil money - uses it to help the disabled, low unemployment - literally doesn’t give benefits to anyone & they provide adequate jobs with adequate salaries for all capable, & looks after their pensioners really well
4195 2018-02-11 21:56:28 Frame is chro moly too. I've been researching some home brew concoctions involving linseed oil, solvent, and maybe a bit of synthetic motor oil. A bare steel shovel blade coated with linseed oil in fall before putting away for winter will not rust
4196 2018-02-11 21:56:24 The mom was legit staring me down and her daughter was trying to tell me about how she lost her earring in the hood of her car and that she hoped the oil changer man would find it in there and it took all the power in me not to laugh and cry in terror at the same time

4200 2018-02-11 21:55:55 Yg oil tuh elok sebab dia memang utk oily/breakout skin :)
4201 2018-02-11 21:55:51 And all of those things are achievable thru recycling, hemp oil, renewables, etc etc. 

What a tired argument. We do not need to be pigeon holed into oil and gas when we're a technology-rich country.
4202 2018-02-11 21:55:50 Oil and water don't mix. You can't mix the corrupt and those promising to fight corruption.
4203 2018-02-11 21:55:48 I was supposed to get an oil change today but this rain got me lazzzyyyyyy.
4204 2018-02-11 21:55:38 Meaden would invest in a company that poured crude oil directly into the eyes of kittens if she thought there was a few bob in it for her. #dragonsden

4207 2018-02-11 21:55:24 Maybe the tankers from Iran or Saudi Arabia got delayed. ON, QC, and the maritimes could have had a reliable, ethical, and stable supply of oil from western Canada but killed the Energy East pipeline. Good luck with the future!
4208 2018-02-11 21:55:08 my mom is making me drink sesame seed oil for my throat i might die
4209 2018-02-11 21:54:34 Canola oil is actually rapeseed oil but the name was changed in Canada for marketing reasons

4220 2018-02-11 21:53:04 rosehip oil is apparently rlly good for healing spots !!!

EIA back adjustment to prediction of Q4/17 global storage of crude, -1.3%.  Huh!
But all the talk is about oil over-production. #OOTT

4232 2018-02-11 21:50:33 The socialist agenda has been completed on Venezuela and it's around the poorest countries in the world, this is coming from a country that is one of the worlds most important sources of oil. Many basic things like food and hygiene products are hard to find and all are imported
4233 2018-02-11 21:50:32 (Also Dallas is super cheap compared to anywhere on the coasts and my dad worked in the oil industry in the 70s-90s, so that is why)
4234 2018-02-11 21:50:29 Opening a bottle of olive oil should not be harder than opening a bottle of wine! Grrr!

4237 2018-02-11 21:49:27 The EU is also flooded with communist and muslims, who call themselves liberals, let them try, they would first have to cross a vast ocean. This is why we need to stop the oil import to our country and create our own energy, let them drink their own gunk...

4246 2018-02-11 21:48:12 I'll be curious what she says the topic of essential oil always intrigues me though I'm dubious about some of the claims made by aroma therapy people but hey if it works why not right (smile)?
4247 2018-02-11 21:48:12 Keep it to about three nights a week. You can do the oil daily but the lemon juice and vinegar is a little harsh on a day-to-day basis. My skin oil af and this helps.

Deep fried food? 

Cooked in cotton oil or blended cotton oil.

Sanitary products made from cotton.

Hemp may have a market share that’s growing, by even a big % growth of FA, is still FA...

4259 2018-02-11 21:46:05 Weldone. Diversification of the economy is fundamental. Even the Saudis are doing everything to reduce its addiction to oil. Good job!
4260 2018-02-11 21:45:54 How do you explain the massive success of the Bush family? Two Presidents of diminishing capability, and very little real talent other than having had the luck of having an ancestor find oil. The Trumps? They are not clever people.
4261 2018-02-11 21:45:44 Girl you need to sage that place! Burn some white candles & rose and lavender oil or incense to start!
4262 2018-02-11 21:45:43 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
4263 2018-02-11 21:44:49 The racist elitists system collude with corps and theyre afraid of a united humanity so they use a systemic injustice system, increase tension and exploit racism to divide&conquer while raping earth of oil/gas/gold/silver.

4274 2018-02-11 21:43:42 Well what do you have Gabriel? Oil is better than nothing
4275 2018-02-11 21:43:41 Now I gotta suck it up and use a bar of Dove, Oil of Olay or Caress whatever else they got in the crib. I'm annoyed.

I'm annoyed because Ima be in the shower an extra 30 minutes, wasting water since the soap doesn't know how to rinse off your fucking skin!
4276 2018-02-11 21:43:39 We’re paying $1.40 a litre, and I understand it’s as high as $1.50 in areas of Vancouver, and oil prices are below $60 a barrow. Even Europe isn’t paying that much.
4277 2018-02-11 21:43:39 my eggs for dinner were 100% made in peanut oil and bitch that's the superior way to make eggs. thank you for lisyeninf

4279 2018-02-11 21:43:34 Husband is changing our oil in the cars so I’m gonna curl up and read orrrrr binge keeping up with the kardashians because I never get this luxury of watching trash tv!
4280 2018-02-11 21:43:34 Remember, Cold War money dwarfs casino+oil+automobile+entertainment money - especially now that potato (ie tech) has been funneled into it. Doesn't take a genius.

4286 2018-02-11 21:42:39 You failed to mention how many corporations like Mobil Oil have received $6 billion in tax cuts. Hard working Americans, not big corporations, deserve more tax relief!  They shouldn’t have to depend on handouts!!  #ShowYourTaxReturns

4288 2018-02-11 21:42:23 Nobody wants to be dependent on oil anymore. #fossilFuels are old school. When they took the USD off the gold standard and made it a #petroDollar based system it lost value in the eyes of the people hungry for change. #BitCoin is OUR choice. #Future is now
4289 2018-02-11 21:42:21 Trains carrying oil don’t have to have automatic braking systems now either since Trump safety rollback. Hope that doesn’t mean another Lac Megantic in the future.
4290 2018-02-11 21:42:11 The coconut oil isn't bad. It actually does help with cradle cap. But slathering that baby head with Vaseline and coconut oil, length checks, sleeping on the stomach, "combing hair" ...she gotta chill
4291 2018-02-11 21:41:46 Dearest Andrew — I remember Col. Reich from his unit’s tremendous battle against the oil men of Houston many moons ago.  A unit left for dead persevered and took the field of battle and forced surrender.  Perhaps he shall do the same for your unit.

4295 2018-02-11 21:41:14 One sticky oil stain. Glad it's away now.
4296 2018-02-11 21:40:41 the only reason i cannot stand the smell/taste of coconut is because, as a child, i had VERY VERY curly and dry hair, and my mom would spend half an hour brushing them everyday and she would apply coconut and monoi oil, two smells i cannot deal with anymore
4297 2018-02-11 21:40:39 As a polemic it is quite effective. Did he not leave the CBC over perceived conflict of interests? I.E. his criticism the of anti oil movement and paid speeches given  to the oil industry folks? Lots of big words. Bombastic comes to mind.
4298 2018-02-11 21:40:21 I got the castor oil one trying to be fancy and it dont hold nothing!

4305 2018-02-11 21:39:55 Let’s ignore that the coal/oil industry funded anti-nuclear propaganda for decades.

Let’s also ignore natural gas, which is used to make up for S/W’s (frequent) shortfalls in terms of consistently generating enough to meet energy demands.

4311 2018-02-11 21:39:20 viscous is a good choice of words for Conway because her speech flows like hot oil. But using viscous where you did in that sentence messes up the syntax. Makes it seem like the 'attackers' have the ability to move smoothly. But is that what you meant to say?
4312 2018-02-11 21:39:20 When you don't know that what  
FG has done in the last 3yrs is a sort of miracle that it didn't get worse when our revenue dipped terribly.Just check other countries who hopelessly rely on oil like us & compare our situation with them. Check inflation in Angola,Venezuela etc..
4313 2018-02-11 21:39:19 A wonderful episode as always of #callthemidwife BUT please ALL pregnant women DO NOT take castor oil to bring on labour. This is dangerous for both mother and baby! Please speak to your midwife for further advice! @CallTheMidwife1 @4JennyAgutter @RCHTWeCare
4314 2018-02-11 21:39:18 My sister likes to make fun of me on her Snapchat when I cook eggs Bc one time the oil kept popping and hit me in the ear and from that day on I wear a hoodie that protects me whenever the oil pops and hits my skin
4315 2018-02-11 21:39:18 when was the last time u changed your oil...
4316 2018-02-11 21:39:12 I value IEA and EIA. I could do nothing w/o them. At the same time, their forecasts would be more realistic w/ additional geoscience & engineering staff w/ oil industry experience. FWIW (& it's not worth much to them, I imagine).

4322 2018-02-11 21:38:36 100% Coconut oil. Swear by it. Not too much, just a smear but there’s no excess chemicals as it’s a natural product typically consumed. Also serves as a makeup remover and hand cream! Never looked back.
4323 2018-02-11 21:38:33 Cz during the campaign he'd made comments like we should've taken the oil in regards to the wars, etc. Then not long after, thinking it was March or April I seen that come out in the news 2, thought maybe that Eric Prince's name was in that story abt the gems&minerals too, trying

4327 2018-02-11 21:38:16 I often point out the Griff trade was even worse than seems.  Chia paid huge to get sound, physical foundational D, even if not star.  That failure put more pressure next yr to do Lars/Hall deal.  If better deal made in 2015, Oil would still have Hall.

4334 2018-02-11 21:37:35 I'm pretty sure we're still subsidizing oil companies to make record profits. You just don't like socialism when it applies the poor people being able to feed themselves and not die of health problems.

4344 2018-02-11 21:36:19 I confess complete hapless confusion on which olive oil to buy. It’s gotten so that it now appears that unless it was pressed in a rustic facility in Sicily while Vito Corleone toured it with his family before killing Don Cicci with a cheese knife, it isn’t real EVOO.
4345 2018-02-11 21:35:44 It's bunkered oil with Togo showing on the shipping docs as the point of origin

4348 2018-02-11 21:35:03 Which is my point and take their win on home ice vs Vegas with a grain of salt b/c of the Knights goaltending situation. Also, if we are being honest, they were lucky to take 4 pts from Arizona.

4388 2018-02-11 21:28:49 I think the real issue is why corporations are now putting so much oil in our food. They never used to, what is driving that need, like in chocolate. People need to say no and boycott products with added palm or  nothing will change

4391 2018-02-11 21:28:10 Agreed. And if Alberta truly wants oil jobs they'd be pushing for a refinery in Edmonton.
4392 2018-02-11 21:28:07 Agree oil moves opposite of US dollar which will also reverse

4429 2018-02-11 21:21:24 So, in Saudia Arabia, their solar farms are producing electricity $1,80 per hour... where they have ample oil... Unfortunately, you can't transport electricity, like oil, but still.... it's a disturber in the marketplace. Writing is on the walls.
4430 2018-02-11 21:21:21 They’ll just pour barrels of oil on the pitch while the city players frolick around in it

4436 2018-02-11 21:20:25 James checking back in the Cavs. Seems to have shaken off whatever he tweaked.

He's a cyborg, so they probably changed out the part, gave him some oil and got him back up and running.

4442 2018-02-11 21:19:06 We use barbed wire at prisons and military bases, not on the border. We use non harmful deterrence, because harmful deterrence has gotten the US sued for millions. Plus, it's a violation of about 100 laws to put oil through a pipe like that (with no leak detection)
4443 2018-02-11 21:18:55 Ocasionally, I take 1 tbsp Organic Olive Oil for my liver.  However, what is this product used for?
4444 2018-02-11 21:18:35 Yeah but we have oil and whisky
4445 2018-02-11 21:18:24 The ppl that showed up were directed to. Ask them pointed questions on why they are there. It's bcse of racism or something. Be honest
4446 2018-02-11 21:18:22 I am for the legalization and further medical research of CBD oil. I haven’t seen anything that shows that THC has medicinal benefits and I think that a lot of people who are pushing for medical marijuana just want to get high.
4447 2018-02-11 21:18:20 That’s what happens when you have media funded by Qatari oil barrens.

4449 2018-02-11 21:18:06 I think over-reliant on crude oil is more of a curse than blessing..Hope we don't degenerate to this level. I only hope.
4450 2018-02-11 21:17:49 Maybe you should try buying players with 'oil money' then you'll have a team like us arguably the best team in PL history
4451 2018-02-11 21:17:13 A useful narrative if it were actually the organization bestowing said honour upon itself. People need to accept there is a big difference between celebrating their past and "living in it". One has nothing to do with the other. #Oilers

4455 2018-02-11 21:16:52 Why not send the oil by pipeline to Hudson Bay?
4456 2018-02-11 21:16:31 President Trump is helping America take over the global oil market.

Putin gets his money & power from oil.

President Trump is slowly taking that away.

That is much better than silly sanctions.

4491 2018-02-11 21:12:08 I certainly hope someone less ignorant than the troll known as St. Klaus is reading the discussion from @orangulandtrust to begin to understand the complexity of the palm oil issue. St. Klaus clearly lacks the maturity or intellect to grasp it.

4512 2018-02-11 21:08:37 I think the world will need oil but the swing now is to minimal impact and a downshift in consumerism so I am curious how this will translate into the demand for oil. Sharing is now big. We buy less. We borrow/loan. I'd say that oil consumption would be decreasing not increasing.

4514 2018-02-11 21:08:31 Yet oil stocks continue HYPERDRIVE DECLINES.  Think about that when you focus on the supply side of the equation...where did that "HYPERDRIVE" oil go?  Not into storage.

4524 2018-02-11 21:07:14 Its better for government to completely deregulate the oil industry. Why allowing some few individuals to hold us into ransom? We are already used to buying fuel at above 200. So, how would it cost us if they decide to remove the subsidy?

4560 2018-02-11 21:02:00 @VOCMOpenline @maryshortall The statement that the deficit is going away is based on 2017 prov govt budget forecast where oil prices rise, but neither Canadian $ nor interest rates rise & the $300 to $500 Million/yr Muskrat Falls subsidy is not included. #nlpoli
4561 2018-02-11 21:01:48 We went in there and liberated them from oppression a ruthless dictator and yes on the faults pretenses but nevertheless we absolutely should be taking some oil out of it. Wake up
4562 2018-02-11 21:01:40 Good luck with that easy fix
4563 2018-02-11 21:01:39 Vitamin E oil. Changes ur life
4564 2018-02-11 21:01:38 Matthew 25:10 But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut
4565 2018-02-11 21:01:33 I have been putting off getting this oil change for months so when i finally decide to go and get one today it’s a 2 hour wait. 
4566 2018-02-11 21:01:28 Oil led the bear nominal move last summer, reals will really catch fire if/as nominals keep rising with oil breaking down, HF's massively long WTI. Things get real interesting if US long-end busts through 3.25%. Past = prologue? Squirelly stuff happens to macro after hike #5.
4567 2018-02-11 21:01:22 They’ve had more relegations than league titles, I’m sure you’d have loved watching your club being relegated, or are just wanting to be a city fan once the oil money comes in
4568 2018-02-11 21:01:20 Well, its killing Muslims who don't have a homeland of their own. No oil or gas reserves or other natural resources for the West to crave. Besides, they are no threat to the Country of Israel, so don't expect actions.
4569 2018-02-11 21:01:15 Some people are like oil and water
4570 2018-02-11 21:01:13 People like you want just enough oil production to keep life comfortable and convenient for you. While others in oil industry do without jobs and essentials you ride around on your moral high horse telling US what's right. Tired of the likes of you.
4571 2018-02-11 21:01:08 Oil greatest team celebration tonite.. whos going? Who wants to... one ticket available. Cheap.
4572 2018-02-11 21:01:06 We invaded their country, tore up their land, and we should have the right to steal their oil? Your logic is mind boggling.
4573 2018-02-11 21:00:59 I have so many moisturizers && I hate how oil takes forever to dry :((
4574 2018-02-11 21:00:51 My saturday night aka my Birthday Eve is having a functional essential oil diffuser is.
4575 2018-02-11 21:00:48 “ sometimes I wish I was born in Saudi Arabia. On the off chance I’m an oil sheik!”
4576 2018-02-11 21:00:48 Eucerin and coconut oil has my skin on 10000
4577 2018-02-11 21:00:40 sjdjd its bc im painting an oil painting atm and i took them home with me from school but lucky coincidence
4578 2018-02-11 21:00:24 Is oil really a necessity right now to buy
4579 2018-02-11 21:00:23 And yet the mess the Oilers are currently in has nothing to do with that. A convenient narrative but one that isn't accurate. Chiarelli has nothing to do w/ their past but whatever floats your boat.
4580 2018-02-11 21:00:15 Dead account doe don’t even use this app as its fucking shit just thought I’d get myself in some beef with some city fans who have been there since 09 when all that oil money came flowing in
4581 2018-02-11 21:00:12 no, it won't, because other oils don't have the properties of palm. And if companies stopped using it, they would have to do more to improve product quality and stock cycle, which wouldn't mean using another oil or tropical plantation product
4582 2018-02-11 21:00:00 Well Oil still generates most of the Electricity used to charge the Cars. Also the cars have very limited range...Charging time also a Problem. Best Solution for me is the Hybrid Cars
4583 2018-02-11 20:59:59 Absolutely rubbish. You have no clue what you’re on about. Scotland would have flourished if we had left the uk before they stole our oil. Look up the mcCrone report. Don’t ignore what the crown has done to the Scots throughout history. We have great reason to hate the crown.
4584 2018-02-11 20:59:49 I use Giovanni - avocado & olive oil conditione.
4585 2018-02-11 20:59:26 If this ever happens again, use warm oil.
4586 2018-02-11 20:59:22 Again, I write oil when I mean all fossils.

4591 2018-02-11 20:58:09 I bought an oil diffuser that has a bluetooth light up speaker and its the best thing i’ve bought in awhile
4592 2018-02-11 20:57:56 It's actually an anti climber pipe, made to make it harder to get over with a ladder. It's not thick enough or layered like you have to have for oil due to leak detection requirements.
4593 2018-02-11 20:57:51 ...And out goes oilsand an in comes shale gas and shale oil. Fantastic! 
4594 2018-02-11 20:57:46 What oil do you use chap?
4595 2018-02-11 20:57:44 Thank you. I’m very happy to note that the vast, vast majority of my over 400 supporters are individuals donating between $50 and $100, many kicking in $20. I’m owned by them, not oil/gas/mining money and big dollars.
4596 2018-02-11 20:57:37 Is the red cloud unburned fuel or motor oil?

4599 2018-02-11 20:57:13 California is working on having more CBD oil and less opioids.  There is science to support it.

4605 2018-02-11 20:56:30 I wash my hair every two weeks. I use wild hair growth oil for my scalp. It really helps.
4606 2018-02-11 20:56:10 Clark was the embodiment of the "Oil Deep State" effort to take over BC just as it has in Alberta and Ottawa.
4607 2018-02-11 20:56:04 I get 100% natural peanut butter and mix some stevia with the oil and stir it all together.
4608 2018-02-11 20:56:00 I had no idea what it was all about I saw a tweet after the Oil game last night and than looked into it his tweet made no sense after a Saturday night game to say don’t let Monday get you down. But than I found out Monday widely to be considered the worst day of the week = black

4611 2018-02-11 20:55:33 Getting my oil changed for my car and hopefully they finish early
4612 2018-02-11 20:55:28 I forgot the pot on the stove which had oil in it. The oil got so heated the place started smoking up.   

I can’t expose how my roommate
4613 2018-02-11 20:55:18 We no longer need it for energy, it's time to wind down the burning of fossil fuels. Land, sea and air can no longer be destroyed by oil spills and air pollution.
4614 2018-02-11 20:55:09 It's true but our people said that when one finger touched oil, it affects the whole 5ive
4615 2018-02-11 20:55:08 With all the sun and drinking ,essential lemon oil in water would be quite beneficial to hydrate and cleanse.
4616 2018-02-11 20:54:56 I guess when an MLA & party leader supports BC industries being attacked by a bully premier, they need to be "put in their place!" LOL We all see you and your party supporting a Texas oil company OVER BCians. We won't forget it either.
4617 2018-02-11 20:54:54 Heya thot you don't trade oil stocks ...
When was the last time you traded oil name?

4619 2018-02-11 20:54:35 Lebron needs some Cowash and Castor oil badly
4620 2018-02-11 20:54:35 I’m glad Sobey’s has withdrawn its support. Placing misinformation in the hands of the uninformed is dangerous and reprehensible. This guy is just another snake oil salesman; probably has shares in the products he’s promoting.
4621 2018-02-11 20:54:34 Discrimination is still discrimination, no matter if it's positive or not. I'm not from Canada but i kinda certain that jobs that pay's well, mining and oil rigs are not on Canadian woman list of desired jobs...
4622 2018-02-11 20:54:30 Humans are contributing to the climate with the deforestation of the forest for palm oil the pipelines, oil spills drilling. Keep in mind Wildlife Animals live in those forest which is killing them off etc
4623 2018-02-11 20:54:30 Yeah. The tips of my hair are dead where i ombred it. I put coconut oil on it all the time.

we are still waiting for our cooking oil  taps 
4625 2018-02-11 20:53:59 if you've seen "there will be blood" with Day Lewis it's based on the book Oil but the book is way superior

4627 2018-02-11 20:53:50 @KatyaBee4 @Permianlandgirl we’re looking for women working in stereotypically male fields to speak on a panel about breaking stereotypes. Would love to chat about women in oil&gas at the @FUNDConference

4629 2018-02-11 20:53:36 getting my cars oil change... it was about fucking time tbh.
4630 2018-02-11 20:53:17 Getting tired of both sides on this farce. US has certainly had no problem interfering with our Canadian elections and oil policy.
4631 2018-02-11 20:53:11 #BigOil is corrupt. Other ways to say it include: dirty, organized crime... Real reason why electric cars are not more widely available is a big dark secret that has been ignored by the lousy #MSM. Best thing is to #divest and put some oil people in jail. #Corruption
4632 2018-02-11 20:53:11 Very few burn oil for electric energy. Only remote islands. Yes I’m well aware that NEW wind or solar plants more efficient. Who builds new oil burning electricity generating plants today? What about organic chemistry based materials or transportat’n chain? Not easily convertible
4633 2018-02-11 20:53:06 All in, this is good for Greek refiners. Keeps crude sourcing cheap..."Last week's avalanche of releases from the U.S. Department of Energy showed daily oil production above 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1970."

4639 2018-02-11 20:51:47 That point was met long ago my friend...it appears as though the masses are finally ready to accept.
4640 2018-02-11 20:51:36 I used to be so weird about having to make sure my expensive ass pants stayed clean and didn’t get dirty but now I work on cars in them. Change oil in them. Ride in them and fix my bike in them and somehow they are actually still clean 
4641 2018-02-11 20:51:25 Congressman, u appear to be out of touch on your focus w/Alabamians.We want a prepared military.We dont want to pay for protecting big oil & drug co's.Currently we are their military & we pay not them. Tax oil & drug co's not America, reduce the debt.
4642 2018-02-11 20:51:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
4643 2018-02-11 20:51:14 You don't have to cut it! Just get some good products. Leave in conditioner, moracan oil, chi oil. Any of those
4644 2018-02-11 20:51:05 Girl it’s soooo easy an you used too much oil 
4645 2018-02-11 20:51:00 Fresh cut flowers, freshly baked cookies, scented candles, oil diffusers or air fresheners offer added appeal when hosting an #openhouse
4646 2018-02-11 20:50:48 Snow. Basically. We don’t really have it as they do. We did own them for hundreds of years, mind you. Maybe I should go back there for a campaign ar some point now that they have the oil money, Olympic athletes and that. Duly noted.
4647 2018-02-11 20:50:43 The thing is, in my opinion, this is an easy fix. Replace Maroon with a speedy LW who shoots a lot. Qualify Strome and use him as a 3C, or replace him with someone who can play C and penalty kill. Trade Sekera and replace him with a RHD who can move the puck.
4648 2018-02-11 20:50:43 Who is this one? What of the people Boko Haram will kill in the next one yr? Let's be reasonable for once, if FG had provided security for the lecturers/oil workers in the first instance they (lecturers) wouldn't have been kidnapped. (2) military can rescue without paying ransom.

4653 2018-02-11 20:49:42 I'm so over it. Legalize but be honest. Whole new set of issues/problems arise. Opportunity cost of opposing this wave turned neg while ago
4654 2018-02-11 20:49:28 alright seriously who got oil cartridges? I haven’t touched my pen in like a week
4655 2018-02-11 20:49:21 Four stroke toro, or if you want to do a gas oil mix then two stroke

4662 2018-02-11 20:48:14 Teach me i tried to make some one time they was dripping of oil 
4663 2018-02-11 20:47:42 United fans are so bitter bro, I don't think they have ever heard the story of a pendulum. It swings side to side guys. Your team didn't start with a bang from it's inception either. Now that balling with oil money, the treatment y'all feel now is gonna last for ever 
4664 2018-02-11 20:47:37 Freedom??? Death and destruction for oil and the corps... Not freedom.
4665 2018-02-11 20:47:18 It needs only no oil

4671 2018-02-11 20:46:16 Dont use the same oil for different types of food ( chips dont go with chicken nor fish ...)
Store the used oil in a jar after filtering it when it cools down
4672 2018-02-11 20:46:11 The US has had a hand in almost all war stricken but oil rich African/Middle-East countries. Perpetrators of injustices all over the world.
4673 2018-02-11 20:45:55 The study you read was likely funded by the coal or oil industry. Modern solar implementations see a turn around in 5-8 years and an expected lifespan of 30 years before they degrade to where they become ineffective.

4675 2018-02-11 20:45:35 When I run out of my favorite perfume I just put on some lavender oil
4676 2018-02-11 20:45:34 A diversity that depends entirely on the oil sector. Otherwise we would not hear you crying coast to coast every time the price of the barrel goes down.
4677 2018-02-11 20:45:29 Time will tell. At 100 oil, it was pump baby, pump.  Then economic reality set in, that s/d is a real thing, and the law of diminishing returns is, law! Can E&P's be restrained?  Can SH's be restrained, if oil $ explodes?  And, of course, demand must keep pace.
4678 2018-02-11 20:45:26 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4679 2018-02-11 20:45:25 ちゃんと説明してくれ
4680 2018-02-11 20:45:23 Unfortunately not. More chance with a pothole as that’s a type of neglect, but oil/diesel on the road isn’t really the council’s fault. It did cross my mind too!
4681 2018-02-11 20:45:21 There is more but it was a travesty. The white man moved in and most of the Five Civilized Nations that we’re driven out died on the trail to Oklahoma. When oil was found, the whites once again tried to drive them out but this time they won, still there.
4682 2018-02-11 20:45:18 白魔語止めろ
4683 2018-02-11 20:45:16 Give them big lavish meals, hots baths, warm beds and send back to DPRK fattened up and happy. The word will spread.
4684 2018-02-11 20:45:16 Indeed. I guese oil have lot to do with it.
4685 2018-02-11 20:45:11 Even doing things like buying natural creamer (no vegetable oil) or brewing weak coffee can help tho
4686 2018-02-11 20:45:08 Would be kind of cool if Rebrab sent a bottle of olive oil into space tho
4687 2018-02-11 20:44:48 I remember being at oil conferences just 5 or so years ago and renewables being largely ignored. Now they get their own sections. Which is as it should be.

4692 2018-02-11 20:44:25 Certainly, sustainable is a term that is easily misrepresented. I believe the RSPO P&C goes some (significant) way to defining sustainable palm oil, but falls short in several key areas. This is why OLT works so hard to address these shortcomings.
4693 2018-02-11 20:44:17 Tweet was about the warm up mr Oil FC!!!
4694 2018-02-11 20:44:15 So I feed our dog coconut oil as a topper or snack on his treats, right? This doggo recognizes the smell and runs over when I'm using my natural skincare 
4695 2018-02-11 20:43:58 Need to screenshot these for the next time someone says “this is why free agents don’t want to play in Edmonton… Because of our toxic Twitter fan base“… It’s laughable, it’s the same everywhere quite frankly… Especially for teams at the bottom half of the league.
4696 2018-02-11 20:43:57 Thats y I said diff association's, I mean outside ,even professional bodies.
4697 2018-02-11 20:43:54 It's the lawmakers in West Virginia that are out of order!

4698 2018-02-11 20:43:51 Always try to use a silver pan cause if you start noticing that the pan started burning from the inner side it means that the oil is too hot to use
If the oil is too hot it wont cook your food but it'll fry its exterior

4702 2018-02-11 20:43:09 Not “light rail” ; @Amtrak . My guess is running through winter west to here combined with poorly maintained tracks that are prioritized for Dakota oil and Wyoming coal freight.

4704 2018-02-11 20:42:18 Ah right. It's important you know. 

My mum and especially grandma like to tell me about life in the50s when it is on. Especially the castor oil.
4705 2018-02-11 20:42:11 I’m going to make a few lemon zest oil, menthol crystal, lavender, emu oil, tea tree oil, rosemary oil infused hair pomades soon.
4706 2018-02-11 20:42:09 We already spent 30.000.000.000 Usd for the refugee. But you say oil trade has been done. Isis is a Abd project. I think you are not sleeping you know the truht but you lie. Because you are aware of Daesh is a ABD project.
4707 2018-02-11 20:42:06 Right!!?! Fox News is just breaking the mold on fake news and appealing to the emotional centers of people, selling snake oil. It’s downright deplorable, Sir! And Breitbart? Good god, right? When did they all sell integrity in favor of an aspiring autocracy! Just deplorable!
4708 2018-02-11 20:42:05 I haven’t heard of it, also love an oil cleanser but am currently dedicated to finishing the products I have on hand so I’m using a foaming glycolic cleanser that I suspect is frying my skin cells one by one.

4711 2018-02-11 20:41:48 Keep trying to change your legacy, but it is set. You voted for the big oil interests over the little guys' health and welfare. And you enable a racist, sexist, misogynist by your silence.
4712 2018-02-11 20:41:47 Beat the eggs, season with salt and pepper.
Add more oil to the pan, mix in the noodles and stir them up well with the veggies.
Short cook.
Pour in eggs. Give them a few moments and then throw it all in the oven.
Voila!
Add sauce trio and enjoy!

I forgot groundnut oil on fire and almost burnt down my house because of twitter trending topic. 

I for dey sleep for TL now if not for sense of smell.
4714 2018-02-11 20:41:42 By the end of my shift I’m gonna have enough oil on my face to fry plantains
4715 2018-02-11 20:41:21 if you go through that list "oil" by Upton Sinclair is fantastic-stands alongside Grapes of wrath as a novel of that era-and that is some compliment,to compare with steinbeck
4716 2018-02-11 20:41:19 “essential oil pyramid” is honestly a top tier phrase if you take away the context
4717 2018-02-11 20:41:17 Tea tree oil
4718 2018-02-11 20:41:16 Ok, you ready? I'm going to tell you so hopefully I remember because I always forget.
Preheat oven to 350.
Make soba noodles according to package (quick boil, splash with cold water, add touch of oil, set aside)
While the water is boiling prep and saute veggies in oil.
4719 2018-02-11 20:40:53 No haven’t heard of it, but I do love an oil cleanser, I’m using Kiehl’s midnight recovery oil cleanser at the moment and it’s incredible
4720 2018-02-11 20:40:49 The west particularly the US is eying the Turkana oil,so anybody or anything standing between the oil and their quest will face the music.its clear their intentions are hell bent pure evil to sabotage democracy in this country n subvert the will of pple.

4722 2018-02-11 20:40:48 Id teach you
Frying 101
Never fry anything wet
Never let the oil get too hot
Wet one finger and drop one droplet of water into the oil if it sizzles its good to go
If the oil start smoking its too hot turn the fire off and let it cool down for a bit
4723 2018-02-11 20:40:42 Are you trying to say one man is doing more damage than big oil and coal? That's just sad guys
4724 2018-02-11 20:40:40 Gov that is most responsive to ppl is closest to ppl. I wanted road fixed. I saw Comm and asked him. 2 days later it was fixed. Call DC?

4726 2018-02-11 20:40:31 but if everyone in the USA and EU avoided all but minimal palm oil use, the market would be dramatically reduced, meaning palm plantation area could reduce, let alone be arrested

4728 2018-02-11 20:40:22 Complex.  Depends on crude gr. vs demand, vs competition for that grade.  WTI is a light grade, thus 1 part of refinery recipe.  If WTI over-prods, will drop WTI price, increase spread, unless other lights go off-line, off setting + in shale light oil, maintaining s/d ratio.
4729 2018-02-11 20:40:22 Maybe if you can’t go to the DR you can try some natural options! Oil of Oregano and garlic help, along with apple cider vinegar! Cheap options that hopefully could help you feel a bit better!! sending healthy vibes your way!

He gave a transparently stupid excuse. WTAF?

4774 2018-02-11 20:33:50 Anointing is the ritual act of pouring aromatic oil over a person's head or entire body. By extension, the term is also applied to related acts of sprinkling, dousing, or smearing a person with any perfumed oil, milk or other fat. Probably wasn't a religious act for @POTUS

4778 2018-02-11 20:33:05 Logic has no relation to your comment. The Golan Heights was an opportunistic Israeli land grab which they seek to illegally profit from via oil theft. Syria has not attacked Israel for 45 years. Israel has attacked 100s of times. The biggest threat to Israeli security is Israel.
4779 2018-02-11 20:33:04 In case there's a change of pair this week,  the following people should take note:

2. Tobi: start drinking anointing oil,  and use salt to bath so as to detach from Cee-C!

4832 2018-02-11 20:25:30 I am so proud of my younger brother, was making spag and friend turkey  and i posted it on my snap. He saw it and sent a mesg that oil is too much you should grill it next time. This is someone who used to fry everything from eggs, to plantain alot. Bsc kinesiology in view!!!
4833 2018-02-11 20:25:05 Not to be combative but the majority of the UAE’s GDP is from tourism. They knew that the limited amount of oil they have wouldn’t last and planned ahead.
4834 2018-02-11 20:24:59 I use REAL African black soap (not the brand shit) to wash my face with and then I use jojoba oil as the moisturizer (it doesn’t make ur face feel oily)

4836 2018-02-11 20:24:37 @BP_Press As you know, I covered the Gulf oil spill for several years for now-defunct Examiner. I'm in London all year at grad school. Any chance I can finally get that interview with an engineer or? Topic: #Corexit. I'm at lauriewiegler@gmail.com. #BP #oilspill #DeepwaterHorizon
4837 2018-02-11 20:24:35 I put my order in! Put the wrong zip code in, sent you an email about it . Finally got the oil cleanser. Since I wanna start back oil cleansing, why not go with the best

4839 2018-02-11 20:24:27 @ReneeGoldsberry I have to thank you. You once talked about using coconut oil in your hair. As mine grows back after chemo, that coconut oil has been the biggest help. Otherwise I scratch at it all day. Thank you. I have passed the trick on to others.
4840 2018-02-11 20:24:22 Girl if u don’t buy some damn castor oil
4841 2018-02-11 20:24:05 Tensions are high between Iran and Israel, they say. How do oil markets react?

4843 2018-02-11 20:23:22 I literally had a bag of doritos, a homemade olive oil garlic pasta, a big mac and large fries, 5 mini chocolate croissants, fried eggs, m&ms all in one day today
4844 2018-02-11 20:23:15 "The hotel now symbolizes the ways in which Saudi Arabia still stands apart from the outside world, as its leadership attempts a historic reordering of society with new freedoms for women, a more moderate brand of Islam and a market-oriented economy less tethered to oil" WSJ
4845 2018-02-11 20:23:14 Even Chelsea fans who are on the verge of discovering oil with the way they are going down are trolling ManUtd. Pathetic! See ya on Weds
4846 2018-02-11 20:23:13 I would love to give them a good massage with a choice of your massage oil.

4850 2018-02-11 20:22:39 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
4851 2018-02-11 20:22:26 Shame on all of these so-called bought and paid for by gas and oil cops. What a crime against American's indigenous people and our limited and precious resources.
4852 2018-02-11 20:22:01 Q:Before Olive Oil met Popeye she was engaged to someone. Who was he
4853 2018-02-11 20:22:01 It was the case for centuries. So no change. The problem is that lots of people want to be the dictators and get the oil money for themselves. Makes a lot of trouble not to have a democracy and not being challenged by public vote.
4854 2018-02-11 20:21:53 y am i so clumsy my fuckin hands are gonna smell like lime and almond oil for days
4855 2018-02-11 20:21:50 Day after a game night and I thought I would do church and a man oil change! Hahahahaha! Got trough (an amazing service) and realized oil change isn’t happening. Hope Nero (car) understands. #carmaintenance #SundayMorning #VtM
4856 2018-02-11 20:21:49 @a_Anisa_788 ну эффект плацебо никогда не подводит
4857 2018-02-11 20:21:42 Thats ok if you feel that way. When I look around and see companies expanding, hiring, bringing co.back from Mexico or China? I just wonder why it took 8+ yrs to happen! Stock market highs! U r no longer TAXED if u dont buy insurance. Oh the oil pipeline running! But i digress
4858 2018-02-11 20:21:21 *bridge* engineer calls for second Bay bridge.

In other news, my mechanic said I need another oil change and my dentist said I need another cleaning.

More infrastructure for traffic doesn't solve traffic problems.
4859 2018-02-11 20:21:16 Alright twitter fam I got 3 choices:
Do an oil change on my car,
Do my taxes
Hit the casino
4860 2018-02-11 20:21:13 “Shale is a retirement party for the oil industry.”
4861 2018-02-11 20:21:07 The idea you send $ to DC then beg to get a portion back is insane. Why? One size fits all, top down defies logic. Did just fine before DOE
4862 2018-02-11 20:20:54 Oil change 
Windshield wiper fluid 
Pumped tires 
Now I just gotta detail tf out of my little toaster oven of a car.

4871 2018-02-11 20:19:19 The Gate job went well, although my Land Rover on Monday decided to drop all of its oil over night on my drive, so that was in for 2 days. Still got the job done  #burystedmundshour
4872 2018-02-11 20:19:15 I dare all of you to eat clean for a month. No processed foods , no fast food, no food with a lot of oil. & at the end of that month , try fast food or processed food. I promise it won’t taste as good as you always thought & you’ll probably feel like shit after.

4876 2018-02-11 20:18:48 The major difference I would make is use butter with the bacon or add it right after the bacon crisped. I'm also not a fan of olive oil based roux.
4877 2018-02-11 20:18:39 Oil and gas will continue to be the dominant industry, but they have diversified their economy in the last couple of decades
4878 2018-02-11 20:18:37 я сто раз это говорила и повторю ещё раз. Хосоку надо сниматься в дорамах!
4879 2018-02-11 20:18:27 He probably think that working man in Oil Industries having similar behaviour as extreme Muslims!
4880 2018-02-11 20:18:24 The Federal Government could still sell off land and mineral/oil rights to private companies. If the Government was selling land for say $12,000 an acre they could come up with over $7 Trillion not including GDP
4881 2018-02-11 20:18:06 My brother is a fool! He said you can anoint someone with oil but you can also anoint them with bleach in they EYES

4886 2018-02-11 20:17:12 Hot tea, rub some shiling oil on your forehead and take a nap. 
4887 2018-02-11 20:17:07 No doubt. Moving to the side a bit from oil and gas.
4888 2018-02-11 20:17:04 *puts on clothes to go to the store
Wait, let's eat this Cassava leaf before I go
*takes off clothes to avoid potential palm oil stains...
4889 2018-02-11 20:16:55 Of course. With or without oil?
4890 2018-02-11 20:16:54 Despicable. The oil and gas industry have the best toadies.
4891 2018-02-11 20:16:39 Despite crude oil price sharp drop and almost empty ECA. He was able to revamp d agric sector, npower scheme, home grown school feeding etc

4895 2018-02-11 20:16:14 Great... just spilled half a bottle of Moroccan oil al over my dressing table
4896 2018-02-11 20:16:14 Yes and every President including 45 embraces them out of the need for oil and money. That’s the sick part. No President has been more silent on their behavior than 45.
4897 2018-02-11 20:16:07 Should get back into oil pulling. I used to do it like once a week a few years ago then i went away to college and the habit just disappeared.
4898 2018-02-11 20:16:01 Good grief.. Are you still spewing this drivel? We're on to you Rachel. We know how much you hate us sewer rats and our oil & gas industry. You can't change that! #ableg #ndpfail #yyc #yeg

4901 2018-02-11 20:15:48 It makes me crazy, these lefties go on about how they hate Trump & all but are OK w/giving nearly 50% of  oil revenues to because Soros says pipelines are evil
4902 2018-02-11 20:15:43 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Netanyahu is illegally 
invading a country to please his donors, oil & war profiteers. Not only that, he is doing it with our money!
Iran has been in Syria for decades by the invitation of
The Government of Syria! America First, Not War profiteers first!
4903 2018-02-11 20:15:36 I hope you understand why Uganda choose it's oil pipeline to pass through Tanzania . Sababu Wajaruo na Okuyo wana Ujinga mwingi sana.  They have made kenya to be a banana Republic.
4904 2018-02-11 20:15:31 a lot of oil maybe
4905 2018-02-11 20:15:09 Most people I know say what they believe! Then their are the snake oil salesmen
4906 2018-02-11 20:15:04 “He’s very good at that.” @GinaGrad when @TheRealRoosterM said @adamcarolla had answered his own questions when Ace asked him where we were with oil.
4907 2018-02-11 20:14:55 Strange country:
November 2008: satellite we built for 40 billion disappears

September 2004: Ship laden with 30,000 barrels of oil disappears 

August 2017: Rats chase the President out of office 

February 2018: Snake swallows 36 million from JAMB

What's next????
4908 2018-02-11 20:14:55 Haha!! I thought you were referring to my tweet about Mr Body Oil.

4927 2018-02-11 20:12:08 Your desert dwelling oil rich brothers (SA&UAE&Qatar) want to destroy and divide your country like other Muslims countries that they have been trying to divide. Muslim countries ruled by none Muslims=SA and UAE, their kingdoms are promised protection exchange for their freedom.

4931 2018-02-11 20:11:43 Press it, then if you want it crispy bread it with soy milk + pankako, flour & spices! Otherwise just let it sear in oil for like ten minutes
4932 2018-02-11 20:11:37 Well they paid it to us and we owed it back. Or are you like Trump thinking Iraq owes us its oil and we have the right to take it?
4933 2018-02-11 20:11:28 Agreed. Investing in oil sand extraction & shipping bitumen from BC Coasts will NOT lower global temperatures; worse, it is likely to have catastrophic effects for Canada's coastline, health of marine ecosystems & BC citizens. #letsbehonest @BCGreens @jjhorgan

4936 2018-02-11 20:10:48 I may switch to derma es stronger vitamin e oil or add it in, because vitamin e helps a lot with dark spots also. I also use occlusive moisturizers because my skin lacks a lot of hydration, so the oil goes BEFORE the moisturizer instead of after.
4937 2018-02-11 20:10:44 Ppl of means NEVER send their kids there. They wouldn't think of it, EVER! Schools run by unions/boards which are local and top heavy.

4941 2018-02-11 20:10:18 Trolls are out tonight again. Tonight's condemnation: We've had "zero impact" on the issues associated with palm oil. We'll that's the last 15 years wasted!
4942 2018-02-11 20:10:17 Benet discovered that the Biblical plants or spices "kaneh" (Ez. 27:19; Is. 43:24; Ct. 4:14), "kaneh ha-tob" (Je. 6:20), and "kaneh-bosem" (Ex. 30:23). "Kaneh-bosem" was an ingredient of the holy anointing oil:

4946 2018-02-11 20:10:02 Coconut oil is not a moisturizer...
4947 2018-02-11 20:09:59 Well Saddam also invaded countries, fired missiles at Israel, gassed his own people and Iran with WMDs, broke UN Resolutions, deliberately ignited oil wells causing an environmental disaster, etc, etc, etc.
4948 2018-02-11 20:09:44 My holy grail oils right now have been derma e anti wrinkle oil. It’s safflower oil with vitamin E and A, both great for acne and skin tone. And my beloved bio oil. That oil has just always worked well with my skin.
4949 2018-02-11 20:09:44 Absolutely there was a tweet a couple of years ago about Trump and Putin involved in shady business concerning oil fields, that could very well be some of the big time shit Trump is involved with
4950 2018-02-11 20:09:37 Please could you do up your kimono Steve and wipe some of that excess oil off your chest. I’m having trouble doing my word search.
4951 2018-02-11 20:09:24 Que nochonnnn , sos una cosa de locos fuel oil 
4952 2018-02-11 20:09:18 The last time I was “serviced” was when this grizzled ol’ fucker at the one pump Esso station on Route 66 checked my oil and filled my tank back in 1964.

4954 2018-02-11 20:08:39 I want with the Democrats want I'm against energy Independence, Bernie Sanders keep oil in the ground, against fracking you know everything that would help Putin, against DAPA a carbon tax which is a tax on gasoline which would probably mean $8 a gallon.#Olympics #MAGA #Trump
4955 2018-02-11 20:08:28 But then who would pay for Obamacare? The interest charged on loans pays for Obamacare...which is why the O admin pushed people taking out loans...which pushed up the tuitions. Also, royalities to Univ from oil were removed.
4956 2018-02-11 20:08:21 RIGHT???!!! WTF are people thinking? Oil and natural gas are going to become redundant?? Don’t think so! 
4957 2018-02-11 20:08:12 Coconut oil sounds like me at the dentist couldn't get my tongue ring out for xrays. Or ibuprofen or allergy meds
4958 2018-02-11 20:07:48 Poll results!   
The question was, You can only watch 1 portion of the oil balance for the rest of 2018, what do you choose?

43% Demand (Surprising to me)
34% Shale (not surprising)
14% OPEC (Would have expected higher)
9% other production (about right)
#OOTT
n = 347

4961 2018-02-11 20:07:26 Definitely yes bcoz the first women who opposed the noteban,gst & oil prices hiked frequently

Government
Police
Herdsmen
Boko Haram
Agberos'
NNPC & Independent oil marketers

Please include yours.
4963 2018-02-11 20:06:58 Think of Israel as a U.S. state in the Middle East. Most people think it’s all about oil. Not really, we have our own oil, it’s about control, and keeping China & Russia from “controlling” the ME. Basically if, it wasn’t us, it would be them.

4967 2018-02-11 20:06:37 Uhh...light oils are like almond and avocado oil. Coconut oil SEALS in moisture. A moisturizer usually has water as a first ingredient. Petroleum is def isn’t good for natural hair. But what do I know? My hair is only waist length. 
4968 2018-02-11 20:06:37 Then the autozone associates try to upsell you junk lol like no. Just paying for my oil- nothing more.

4974 2018-02-11 20:06:24 It’ll assume density of water, which will work fine for most stuff (not oil though.)

But, again, I’m most enraged by cups of flour and the like. Not fluid ounces.
4975 2018-02-11 20:06:07 Please dont go. He is a snake oil salesman.
4976 2018-02-11 20:06:04 Try toasting the couscous with oil and using more water. Toast 2 cups couscous with 1 TB EVOO 5 minutes. Add 2 1/2 cups water, salt and bring to boil. Cover and simmer over medium low for 9-12 minutes. Let stand 3 minutes. :)
4977 2018-02-11 20:06:02 The origin of the oil is, it is 25% of Canada’s GDP so get off your high horse, slap your face,when I say OUR it is Canada’s product that is sold w/royalties going 2 local,provincial, national economy, you really are dull on the economy, aren’t you?if it is sold@discount<$

4984 2018-02-11 20:05:04 Pro Tip: Did you know mango trees contain the same oil as poison ivy and poison oak? Learned that the hard way when my face swelled shut. Just a warning for all you traveling in Costa Rica. :)
4985 2018-02-11 20:05:03 That seems about right? Have you ever tried CBD oil in tea?
4986 2018-02-11 20:04:59 Btw oil for an oil change is expensive lol
4987 2018-02-11 20:04:44 @C2Wtweets Hey! Spoke with a guy from Motul on friday, and they color their oil and  make it smell like bananas on purpose! They said it was some sorte of  branding. Just to make it more recognizable! and yeah, 100% legit, the  french have there ways :-)
4988 2018-02-11 20:04:43 Breaking news - too much oil makes for bad tv

4991 2018-02-11 20:04:21 I don’t know if this counts as one Dr Brown but my father had a heart attack app. 5 years ago, and my family did not think he was going to be the same. Someone gave me some anointing oil one morning, blessed and prayed for him, now he is perfectly fine and healthy.
4992 2018-02-11 20:04:13 Dustin, do you have a problem getting cdb oil? I thought it was legal in every state, though not covered by insurance.  It helps me with osteoarthritis.

But that cleaning oil 
4995 2018-02-11 20:03:41 Okay.
4996 2018-02-11 20:03:34 I'd be really curious about the challenges of analyzing the foreign policy aspects in terms of proactive US policy vs. more reactive, even just re: oil. I'm thinking Iraq War vs. Yom Kippur War support for Israel but I know there are countless other variables here. Great topic.
4997 2018-02-11 20:03:23 Today is Saturday I like to make pan fried rabbit with pattato wegdes home made offcours I put sea salt pepper and smoked paprika on the wedges the rabbit is marinated all night in withe wine and garlic then fried in oil ,carrots,shallots,adgarlic
4998 2018-02-11 20:03:23 Let's also turn the military into a commercial venture. It would be really interesting to see how many American people invest in things like sailing Navy destroyers into hostile African waters just to escort an oil CEO meeting with a corrupt dictator.
4999 2018-02-11 20:03:15 Hell yeah!What a pass!
5000 2018-02-11 20:03:04 Roses, argan oil, and the faint smell of tobacco. You may have a slight touch of coffee there too if it's in the early morning. #whatdoesmyfursonasmelllike
5001 2018-02-11 20:02:57 They got quite puffy. I think because I used coconut oil and kefir instead of butter. I also added ground ginger, cardamon and cinnamon. Would recommend.
5002 2018-02-11 20:02:49 i have a problem with that because motor oil and rust smell good but they do not taste good
5003 2018-02-11 20:02:46 By Turkey dropping the #Euphrates water level Russian and Iranians can cross east and attack the oil fields and ISIS can try to escape to their Russian Iranian allies. Heads up @DefenseIntel @OIRSpox @CENTCOM #SDF
5004 2018-02-11 20:02:44 I decided to diffuse some lavender essential oil last night to help me fall asleep. I posted an instastory about it. I’ve gotten so many people reaching out how some essential oils are harmful to cats. Umm do they really think I’d do something harmful to my cats? #majorsideeye
5005 2018-02-11 20:02:37 Remainers are starting to get very desperate and you epitomise this Andrew Adonis the current government saw through you and sacked you, you tried to make out you did it under your own choice , but they recognise a snake oil salesmen, give me Farage everyday over you.

5007 2018-02-11 20:02:30 you know what sucks about being allergic to rose? literally every skincare product has some form of rose oil or extract in it. so it makes it so hard to find products for my skin.
5008 2018-02-11 20:02:25 If i could stop dripping food and oil on my shirt that'd be really great

5020 2018-02-11 20:01:16 And that's only because I'm already a high enough level of botanist and alchemist to make my own oil, because that shit is overpriced as hell in the market
5021 2018-02-11 20:01:15 truffle oil smells so BAD
5022 2018-02-11 20:01:11 Nah, it's too watery for me to accept that comparison. There are legitimate stouts that deserve the oil comparison in a flattering way; Guinness is dirty water.
5023 2018-02-11 20:01:10 #mijabelthinks
Tea tree oil hands down is the lifesaver for sensitive skin like mine. Acne? Rashes? Eczema? I solve them all with tea tree oil. Sure it doesn’t work magically like three seconds poof-gone but it gets the job done, leaving no scar behind.
5024 2018-02-11 20:01:08 I lost my coconut oil 
5025 2018-02-11 20:01:02 Moisturised my entire body with baby oil & I feel amazing

5044 2018-02-11 19:58:02 I don't know if this is related at all, but an increasing number of friends are using CBD oil to treat pain and anxiety in their dogs. I wonder if any studies have been done in animals?
5045 2018-02-11 19:58:00 Rub your spoon with oil, dip in golden syrup, watch it all fall off the spoon.
5046 2018-02-11 19:57:58 Can they come and run our country please? We're experiencing a hostile takeover by oil, pesticide and gmo gluttons.  Not to mention Russia.

5056 2018-02-11 19:56:05 I get it, King. You are arguing that if diblit spills in water that has no sediment, no current, no weather, etc than it will not sink. I agree. But that isn't how the real world works. Note how the oil industry doesn't know what to do with the Sanchi spill.

5062 2018-02-11 19:55:33 It's because the whole "wellness" trend is disproven bs that is not about healthy living but quackery and snake oil.  Anything that would have him as a keynote speaker other than a criminal inquiry is insane.
5063 2018-02-11 19:55:27 Was thinking of just taking it out, but I’ve got a cold atm. After it’s passed shall I still clean it with pure tea tree oil after taking it out
5064 2018-02-11 19:55:22 Coconut oil smells so nasty 
5065 2018-02-11 19:55:17 money talks. he is not exactly an oil painting
5066 2018-02-11 19:55:08 Nah, we all know that the Turkish pedophile chicken thief jihadists are too busy looting olive oil.
5067 2018-02-11 19:54:53 Firstly UK GDP is higher than any Nordic countries and Canada. Why ur comparing to poorer nations? Secondly, ur compare cat to dog, those countries have different size population land mass national resources ie oil in Norway. Norwegians can live without working if they want to!
5068 2018-02-11 19:54:48 Nicole get the castor oil (I use it every night!)

5071 2018-02-11 19:54:07 I mean, oil rigs do spout pretty easily I hear
5072 2018-02-11 19:54:05 Fold in one hundred scoops of olive oil then cover.
5073 2018-02-11 19:54:05 Most of amheds yep wore dittos during oil crisis pump n dump morrissgate snowflakes  down
5074 2018-02-11 19:53:36 no but it generates huge tax revenues that have and continue to benefit the provinces of Alberta, and Quebec and the Maritimes! Yes the  big oil revenues -and the taxes helped pay for subsidized daycare in Quebec and ironically Green scams in Ontario

5078 2018-02-11 19:52:21 It's cool that the distillations I performed in org chem using a fractionating column have relatable real-life applications, such as the separation of crude oil in a 30m tall fractionating tower! #Lesson5 #FossilFuels #Petroleum
5079 2018-02-11 19:52:17 Facts, truth, history and reason have nothing to do with trump's lies, rant and tweets.  His feeble base would swallow any snake oil he puts out. DACA is a no-brainer to approve with a short path to Citizenship. Delays are inexcusable.

5096 2018-02-11 19:49:19 @KalamazooOlives still carry the blood orange olive oil?
5097 2018-02-11 19:49:16 Canada and Saudi Arabia benefit from the oil industry because the state (due to nationalization) or locals own the companies, not foreign entities. In Africa, mostly foreign entities own the companies that extract commodities, locals do not benefit

5106 2018-02-11 19:47:49 As an Albertan, I couldn't agree more.

Unfortunately no one wants the oil shipped through the province. Even if it economically benefits ALL of us. Even if it's safe. Even if said provinces receive massive equalization payments for it (looking at you Quebec). They prefer foreign

5112 2018-02-11 19:46:59 I love castor oil it helps my (damaged, brittle, over-processed) hair IMMENSELY and has also similarly lessened my crows feet without irritation or breakouts. It is a GODSEND buy a gallon.
5113 2018-02-11 19:46:53 Well, other than a hike in his forehead leaking oil, he’s fine, but I’ve gone over him multiple times to make sure. So I’ll patch him up and give him some time before I send him back to work. Do you mind covering some of his Trains while He’s gone Dani?
5114 2018-02-11 19:46:43 Oil changes are so damn expensive.

5117 2018-02-11 19:46:08 I came for an oil change and now all theses other problems came up.  #annoyed
5118 2018-02-11 19:46:00 Well, the problem has been in place for over 30 years. Shows you have had zero impact. Also, you are showing you don't understand why the market for palm oil exists. Coincided with hydrog veg oil ban. Palm has similar properties
5119 2018-02-11 19:45:56 @KellyannePolls  KELLYANNE . A suggestion for a new INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT . ie: A new ERIE CANAL but in Southern Pennsylvania from HARRISBURG PA TO PITTSBURGH PA ! It would open up the industrial Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean via a quicker route . Coal , lumber , oil etc etc .
5120 2018-02-11 19:45:54 My theory for this is, in JW, we hear Hoskins say, "Do you think the 8th richest man in the world is only into oil, telecom, and family fun parks? He's so diversified he doesn't even know what he owns." cont.
5121 2018-02-11 19:45:47 Mix 1 cup dumplings with 1 pound unicorn tears. Mix into  Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve to your worst enemy.

5124 2018-02-11 19:45:21 Ok so here's the plan.

We gonna rent a moonbounce jousting ring. 

Lather it up in baby oil and soap

And have ourselves a soap bash like the college frat parties. 

Music included.

5130 2018-02-11 19:44:37 Another lie by bhkaths? so where all this money spent? What happened to 2 crore job that is promised... crude oil price went down below 40 dollar during modi period against 140 dollar during 2010 ,still petrol price is above 70 instead of 40 rs.. what happened to all these money
5131 2018-02-11 19:44:35 Where is the logic in that statement- country A produces B oil, country D produces B+1 oil, country X produces B+2 oil.Really matters export & import. So in terms of import US is becoming smaller, in terms of export, US is becoming slightly bigger, but same lvl as UAE production
5132 2018-02-11 19:44:26 So basically she think castor oil changes your DNA aight got it .
5133 2018-02-11 19:44:16 Btw the only money I have made from the energy industry has been in oil exploration. I have saved a lot of money through household solar use however :)

5136 2018-02-11 19:44:00 The US produces around 40% of its oil needs, most comes from Canada (Canadian owned companies), Saudi Arabia (state-owned company), Nigeria (foreign-owned companies) and through back-door channels in the middle-east and Libya thanks to civil unrest and corruption.
5137 2018-02-11 19:43:53 It mostly ruins on liquid oxygen. There is rocket grade kerosene in it but to call it oil fueled is a stretch.
5138 2018-02-11 19:43:46 @chrischalkart 
I am an artist too. Painting by oil colors. Glad to be more familiar.
5139 2018-02-11 19:43:41 my gpa came and got my car at work to get me new tires, an oil change, and filled it up, he's too cute

5141 2018-02-11 19:43:17 What does the DNA evidence say. Of course Cuba wants to say that. They need another oil rich nation to dump money into them now that Venezuela is melting down.

5146 2018-02-11 19:42:13 will you speak up for those IMPACTED by the resource sector? Your job isn't just about promoting oil jobs.

5150 2018-02-11 19:41:52 So why do we continue to purchase oil from Venezuela?
5151 2018-02-11 19:41:44 For now, the US was that way for a long time now no problem. Someone will eventually get the coal and the oil.
5152 2018-02-11 19:41:40 My beard is long enough that I have now purchased beard oil. This is a strange sensation all around.
5153 2018-02-11 19:41:09 And you love a snake oil selling enemy of the American people. Have you really no compassion? Decency? Shame?
5154 2018-02-11 19:41:03 Guess what? Saudi Arabia already scoots their oil down the St Lawrence for Quebec!!! That has to stop.

5191 2018-02-11 19:35:51 At no point did he say the Oilers should be putting him on the block. As Hrudey said during the same segment, almost every player is discussed among GM's & if he's brought up with a crazy return, you have to consider. That is a much different than shopping a guy.

5253 2018-02-11 19:28:48 "Robert De Niro, standing in a metropolis that was built entirely with oil money, bemoans climate change" is the correct headline for this story.
5254 2018-02-11 19:28:42 HOTTEST take, mushrooms taste the best when sauteed in olive oil with spinnach and garlic and salt
5255 2018-02-11 19:28:41 not the point, I know, but have you tried coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner?
5256 2018-02-11 19:28:38 Sir,  i don't intend to join issues with you,  but note that when other climes are looking away from oil,  pmb is still searching for oil...
5257 2018-02-11 19:28:24 Cooking oil and what?
5258 2018-02-11 19:28:23 I love castor oil. I use it for so much.
5259 2018-02-11 19:28:18 I follow paleo, but not very low carb, or high fat. Fat - when  I do use it is mono-unsaturated like olive oil, nuts, avocado. High saturated fat puts my cholesterol up.
5260 2018-02-11 19:28:16 TRUTH is just like OIL on
water, no matter how
large the water is, it will
surely float on it.....
5261 2018-02-11 19:28:03 Drai is not an untouchable, team calls and offers you a #1 Dman, you take it. Run Conor and Nuge down the middle and bring in the proper wingers
5262 2018-02-11 19:27:46 The day that you have your paid driver get into an electric limousine to cart your tired old butt around I'll start listening to you about not drilling for oil.
5263 2018-02-11 19:27:41 Was America great when they, Under Andrew Jackson, used wholesale genocide on Native People’s? Was it Great when last summer they went with a oil company over Native Peoples trying to keep clean water on their own lands? I think not!
5264 2018-02-11 19:27:38 FUCK MY ASS IM COOKING SPAM AND OIL SPLASHED ON ME WTF
5265 2018-02-11 19:27:31 Go figure.
Getting their oil into the mkt was essential to increase supply. We'll deal with Iran and Hez.
5266 2018-02-11 19:27:27 Went to 2 @jiffylube locations today.   Both unable to do a simple oil change.  Time to find someplace else to take my car and my business. #fail
5267 2018-02-11 19:27:24 We can all thank Butts, his puppet Justin, Notley, Horgan and all the BC and QC tree-hugging loons protesting Canadian responsible oil while consuming conflict oil from other places. Also, friendly reminder that #carbontax is theft. #cdnpoli
5268 2018-02-11 19:27:19 Yes, we usually use cooking oil with a small kitchen paper wick - thought we would try the left over bay leaf too which worked!

5270 2018-02-11 19:27:13 You are like a snake oil salesman.... All sample and mirrors. But it will all be gone soon!
5271 2018-02-11 19:27:11 So why make anything in America if we can’t compete? That’s a BS response. We put a man on the moon. We can make some panels. You do know that big oil donates to republicans and democrats right?

5277 2018-02-11 19:26:44 I'm at a bowling alley with my son and I've got an oil pattern you dream about. Surrounded by little kids throwing straight and I'm like ohmigod it's a dream.
5278 2018-02-11 19:26:44 Used coconut oil instead of lotion on my legs after shaving and it is a LIFECHANGER y’all
5279 2018-02-11 19:26:39 @CBCNews @GlobalTV could u pls report on the decommissioning of pipelines? Does Kinder Morgan have to put aside $ for removing pipeline after oil is gone? Who pays for the bill?
5280 2018-02-11 19:26:32 Rest of the weekend review coming. Did oil, eur, dxy earlier this weekend so its further down the feed. Hope everyone had a good weekend

5285 2018-02-11 19:25:36 1. Transitioning hurts like a breakup; you have to watch all relaxed hair fall off while the natural hair takes time to compensate the falling...
2. You need to water your hair like a plant; keep a spray bottle with water and coconut oil handy..
3. Be faithful to the LOC....

5290 2018-02-11 19:24:25 Singing while chopping garlic really finely and mixing ingredients with oil and vinegar. Lord SG asks what I'm making and replied Salah dressing  One track mind!
5291 2018-02-11 19:24:23 The suit is actually scented there are peppermint oil diffusers in each ear! XD
5292 2018-02-11 19:23:57 Iran was leading to a democratic direction under Mohammad Mosaddegh. The US did not like their control of oil being interfered and owned by the Iranian people, so the CIA interfered and turned Iran into the place you describe today. Play the blame correctly. Fool.

5295 2018-02-11 19:23:19 dang it's almost time for an oil change again , I have to get one 58, 303 , Winnie on 57,800, I probably got almost a month left  I think , idk about cars 
5296 2018-02-11 19:22:29 I'll try to use igni, then 1-2 hits with the sword with oil on. Whirl with regen decoctions are awesome, doesn't make you invincible though, which would be nice against them :P
5297 2018-02-11 19:22:21 I was hoping for @BrittanyForce to win, but now I'm just hoping she's OK.

5299 2018-02-11 19:22:15 Bout to soak my whole body in coconut oil 
5300 2018-02-11 19:21:45 My air fryer has made me a lazy cook. I was dead ass gonna fry these pork chops in flour but then I remembered I’d have to coat them in flour after I season them & get rid of the oil when I’m done .
5301 2018-02-11 19:21:43 I have a cousin who lives in a commune with 3 kids, who is super green and eco-friendly.  My sister lives in a large city, her husband commutes and literally works for an oil company.  But their carbon footprint is probably way smaller than my cousin's simply for not having kids.
5302 2018-02-11 19:21:28 S/o to my dad for doing my oil change 
5303 2018-02-11 19:21:17 I’ve had omega oil one time , CHIIIIIILLLLDDDDD i lost my entire life in one cup 
5304 2018-02-11 19:21:11 I'm not expecting to be insulted by someone who wants me to buy his products... Algerian oil is perfectly fine for us. And they speak french on top of it!
5305 2018-02-11 19:21:09 The Sonderkommando delivered the coup de grâce and they were Jewish . It was probably prolonged due to IG farben , basf & IBM having trade deals with standard oil
5306 2018-02-11 19:21:01 For over-easy without flipping try putting a little water in the pan after the oil/butter. Cover the eggs & check at 30 sec intervals to see when the white turns white then you’re done!
5307 2018-02-11 19:20:58 Exactly, the toddler chaos agenda. Watch tv, eat McDonald's, break everything you touch, and leave an orange oil slick wherever he skulks.

5312 2018-02-11 19:20:22 Are you saying big oil didn’t get subsidized under Obama?

5315 2018-02-11 19:20:10 Beard oil is essential
5316 2018-02-11 19:20:07 Perfect, after that they could push towards Omar oil field, that would be nice 
5317 2018-02-11 19:19:23 and the word #shale is becoming like the screech you get when you drag your nails on a chalkboard;  nobody wants to hear it anymore, people are frustrated.  Shale is being used to sink oil prices and outlook; whether justified or not, time will tell. Investors want returns!
5318 2018-02-11 19:19:17 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?

5321 2018-02-11 19:18:21 Just some bulletproof coffee, grass-fed butter, and brain octane oil blended. Caffeine, omega-3 from butter, and medium chain triglycerides from the brain octane oil are quickly converted into ketone energy, improving energy and brain function. Highly recommend #drbridge

5323 2018-02-11 19:18:18 #Nigeria needs to create a Pest Control Task Force. Between rats that chase the president from his office and snakes that swallow money, very soon, whales will start drilling their oil and when that happens, our #Togolese officials wouldn’t have any left to sell.
5324 2018-02-11 19:18:09 It does!!!! Also warm it up a tad if you wanna get the real effect.

Ps. Mixing it with olive oil is the ultimate elixir if you have brittle hair!!
5325 2018-02-11 19:18:03 I think Pence got some coconut oil on his sleeve!
5326 2018-02-11 19:17:37 Big oil what happens when you get low of dead animals?  You might need to campaign for "natural burial for humans!!"
5327 2018-02-11 19:17:34 Corruption like crazy brah smh, uses his counties oil money to buy foreign cars.
5328 2018-02-11 19:17:30 If Scotland  was allowed to stay in the single  market when Englandshire  leaves, we could permit them to use our ports to export their goods to Europe,  and pay for the privilege. Just like they do now with our oil,and whisky etc
5329 2018-02-11 19:17:29 Probably Vegetable Oil instead of butter, rapeseed oil is being added to everything these days, it makes me ill 
5330 2018-02-11 19:17:11 Liberal’s never gained a true majority (less than 40%) So they don’t have a mandate regarding KinderMorgan 
that unites voters.NEB has no credibility.Trudeau has personal friends that work for oil& present a conflict of interest.@jjhorgan

5335 2018-02-11 19:16:34 White. I just stripped our circa 1920s garage's 3 panel sliding door to find solid teak. I put 1 coat of white on it. Q. Do I go to the trouble to finish it bright w/ oil? OR, Do I rip it into strips for a boat worthy of quarter-sawn teak decks that I  haven't built yet?
5336 2018-02-11 19:16:32 Take care with the back, Wayne. Pebble misses you
5337 2018-02-11 19:16:13 I’m so proud!!! My brows are prospering too girl I started putting castor oil in them. 2018 is a year of blessings

5340 2018-02-11 19:15:25 Those were the days when I could be arsed to stand over the mixer with a Calpol syringe full of oil.

5342 2018-02-11 19:15:01 The one job we don’t need are oil rig jobs off the Oregon an Washington coast. Until you can figure out how to keep the tar off the California beaches don’t ruin Oregon and Washington
5343 2018-02-11 19:14:48 I hope you get the opportunity to do so if you still want to! 

I am fat with short hair and personally found it looks way better than it did long bc of my hair texture/shape/oil level etc. It's about personal preference and I'm sorry your mom put her foot down like that...

5351 2018-02-11 19:14:08 Oil sands are nasty sludge
5352 2018-02-11 19:13:52 Looked at sources of plant based natural fats (not industrial oils), global prodn of fat (in million tonnes) is: olive oil 3.3 ; coconut oil 3.4 ;  almonds 0.64 ; cashews 0.33 ; hazelnuts 0.39 ; pistachios 0.30.  Even if cld double production, still only replace half dairy fat /2

5354 2018-02-11 19:13:32 Why did you only mention Trump but you knew all along big oil has been getting subsidies long before.  Your argument is biased and one sided which makes it difficult to take you seriously.

5379 2018-02-11 19:10:39 Again you think you're at the center of the universe... Montreal has the same population as your whole province. Our high taxes are feeding us, not wheat field farmers who think they can insult people into buying their oil...

5381 2018-02-11 19:10:03 Feb 14, 1982: Disastrous storm hits the Ocean Ranger oil rig off the coast of St. John's, NWFLD. The Ocean Ranger was semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling unit. It was battered by hurricane-force winds howling at over 100 km/hr & waves as high 27 m = five-storey building.
5382 2018-02-11 19:09:47 Her wad giving a speech on climate change to a region of the world whose economies are built ENTIRELY on crude oil?   damn that's hilarious!
5383 2018-02-11 19:09:46 If your point was to blame a regime using theology to justify abuses -not that there isnt lots of crime & ordinary corruption in Iran - then he is not wrong to presume you were trying to say buying oil from Alberta Christians is ethically superior, invoking #Islamophobia & denial
5384 2018-02-11 19:09:41 Factors to impact #Inflation
1) International crude oil prices have firmed up since Aug’17, driven by both demand supply-side factors.
2) Non-oil industrial raw material prices have also witnessed a global uptick. Firms polled in the #RBIs IOS expect input prices to harden in Q4.

She’s running for House of Delegates from Ritchie County. Let’s support her. @ACLU @maddow @Lawrence #resist #BlueTsunami2018 #VoteBlue
5393 2018-02-11 19:09:09 The US is the war mongering money funding bitch of Israel. Period. Full. Stop. 
All wars in Middle East is for Israel, and oil and gas. Not Russia!
5394 2018-02-11 19:08:57 The guy is coming today. I kind of hope he decides that he suddenly isn't into classic rock anymore.  A deal is a deal and I am too nice to say that I changed my mind. Plus, heating oil.
5395 2018-02-11 19:08:51 There are strict regulations and requirements for these extremely rare incidents. When was the last time an oil tanker spilled in Canadian waters? I don’t need to stick my head up a bulls ass to know what a good steak is. I’ll trust the butcher. There are policies look them up.
5396 2018-02-11 19:08:29 I made my own cough syrup out of honey and coconut oil. If being sick was an Olympic sport, I’d take the gold. #Olympics2018
5397 2018-02-11 19:08:20 Trump will be gone on April 1 - Oil companies r going bankrupt - Melania beat up Trump with her judo kicks
5398 2018-02-11 19:08:10 @Sammyreturns  Amazing!!! We need to go to attend this!!! We are going to learn a lot and full tummies again 
5399 2018-02-11 19:08:08 Never knew that oil was separated, for all of its conventional uses, by using heat. #Oil
5400 2018-02-11 19:08:03 Are you saying that big oil didn’t get subsidies under Obama?
5401 2018-02-11 19:07:54 So last night I thought I lost my oil & my sister found it mixed in with my clothes in the dryer this morning 
5402 2018-02-11 19:07:50 How does essential oil help?
5403 2018-02-11 19:07:38 Big oil has been getting subsidized before you were born. Are you hiding under a rock or just plain biased?
5404 2018-02-11 19:07:11 Susan, always one to pour oil on a fire! #thearchers
5405 2018-02-11 19:07:10 not dosai, adai. not oil, moisture.
5406 2018-02-11 19:07:10 I use cetaphil as my cleanser (using an exfoliating glove) & drunk elephant’s protoni polypeptide dream as my moisturizer. I also use mario badescu’s rose water facial spray for rehydration & to help a little with my natural redness. And oil blotting pads to avoid pore clogging!
5407 2018-02-11 19:07:08 You are missing my point. The USA produces enough energy for itself even though the oil industry ia privately owned. Its investors and employees live well. They are better off than under state owned companies in Brasil and Russia. State ownership guarantees nothing.
5408 2018-02-11 19:06:56 The US government's budget is benchmarked on rosy economic growth forecasts (3.2% as opposed to current growth of 2.7%), where's the Nigerian government's budget is benchmarked on a favorable oil prices.

Perhaps this is a key reason our economy isn't diversified! #priorities
5409 2018-02-11 19:06:43 Excellent, we need our oil reserve to grow! That’s just one more thing we can use for our country to grow!
5410 2018-02-11 19:06:26 my 5min a day Tracy Oil news .. nothing happend ..
5411 2018-02-11 19:06:13 i got a vitamin c serum and rosehip oil...once these get rid of my acne scars it’s over for you bitches
5412 2018-02-11 19:06:05 Hell no!!  It’s propaganda!!  Sticking to my organic butter and coconut oil!!
5413 2018-02-11 19:06:03 And Iran’s regime has what to do with this?

As bad as some oil exporting regimes are, the fact is they change. The changes wreaked on #climate & #marinelife - like the bleaching of 2/3 of the #GreatBarrierReef & ALL of it in the tropics - cant be fixed by us humans.

#bcpoli
5414 2018-02-11 19:05:53 He is a two-faced lying POS. I mean honestly, what can anyone expect when his father and that other pos Jean Chrétien tried to institute that white paper.  It is more than obvious that he has no power and that this country is run by big oil.
5415 2018-02-11 19:05:53 Natural hair ladies : Make sure you start prepping your hair with coconut oil or an essential moisturizing oil of your choice at least 5 hours before shampooing your hair, if not the night before. Don’t be lazy  it makes a a hell of a difference. Promise.
5416 2018-02-11 19:05:48 Since youve already purchased this product I’d love to know if it cracks at all on the skin or it’s like an oil base that just sticks on pls lmk!!! I’m dying to try this
5417 2018-02-11 19:05:43 hey y'all just informing yous that a tank just spilled around east China containing a milliom barrel of weird oil that mixes or dissolves in water. Marine life's dead around the area, and if it mixes 100% w the water, we all dead lmao
5418 2018-02-11 19:05:37 I love these films that are paid for by big oil.
5419 2018-02-11 19:05:24 Did you use toasted sesame oil?
5420 2018-02-11 19:05:02 Penne cooked in garlic and oil. Broccoli and Spinach
5421 2018-02-11 19:04:48 Like cod liver oil?
5422 2018-02-11 19:04:46 No parece un gran operativo 3000 kg de soja, gastaron más en gas oil, para llegar al lugar
5423 2018-02-11 19:04:35 Thanks guys! I like to tell stories. Better when there’s oil involved.
5424 2018-02-11 19:04:30 Green energy is a shot at oil by people who are paid by the coal people! You don't even know what you're talking about. I wish the world were so simple where you could go "Trump Bad, Solar Good!" It's a lot more complex than that lady.
5425 2018-02-11 19:04:26 not exaaaactly gun oil
5426 2018-02-11 19:04:20 Fascinating discussion. It makes me wonder if the Black Panther movie is ultimately about Neo-Liberal oligarchs courting the Nigerian oil barons.
5427 2018-02-11 19:04:14 Yep, it’s called a free market for a reason. Why should the Gov’t continue to subsidize an industry with tax dollars. I’m tired of the oil companies getting anything as well.
5428 2018-02-11 19:03:55 So Friday, when I finally got back into oil painting, I spent a solid 15 minutes cleaning my pallet which had been sitting with paint for a good 1.5 months so by the time I got to painting I was high on thinner
5429 2018-02-11 19:03:49 coconut oil is not the holy grail
5430 2018-02-11 19:03:44 What're you talking about? That's a fantastic scent profile. Ozone, rain, sugared gun oil.
5431 2018-02-11 19:03:30 @ChrisFixed I have oil in the water but not water in the oil, you think is the head gaskets or the radiator?
5432 2018-02-11 19:03:26 I agree, as long as we also stop subsidizing oil companies and allowing them to pollute land, sea, lake and air. The oil scams must end.
5433 2018-02-11 19:03:15 "I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:" ~Psalms 89:20 #Bible
5434 2018-02-11 19:03:14 Inspite  cooking oil theft. I suggest all chefs should be vigilant of doggyy males hanging around resturants searching for used cooked oil.
5435 2018-02-11 19:03:12 Olive oil based body scrub leaked in my gym bag.  Gross... @thebearcametoo
5436 2018-02-11 19:03:11 I smell like baby oil & vics oil
5437 2018-02-11 19:03:11 Yeah. I've worked with maple a ton lately but never messed with cocobola. Linseed oil is such a great finish
5438 2018-02-11 19:03:02 なんでもう四時なの？
5439 2018-02-11 19:02:42 My skin has been pissed af at me & I have decided to reevaluate my skin care routine , I'm going back to basics & sticking with one face wash, tea tree oil & vitamin e oil for moisturizer twice a day & my Aztec clay mask once a week  I hope it works
5440 2018-02-11 19:02:40 Look great!!!!
5441 2018-02-11 19:02:38 I’ve been doing oil pulling the last two days & I already see a difference!
5442 2018-02-11 19:02:33 I only have olive and castor oil.
5443 2018-02-11 19:02:29 And the oil still at the great barriwe rife?
5444 2018-02-11 19:02:13 Can't sleep though.. and its 2am already. even essential oil can break my anxiety..
5445 2018-02-11 19:02:09 I ditched coconut oil
5446 2018-02-11 19:02:05 many people support turkey on that but they have double standard - Turkey supports Hamas, friends with Iran, jail journalists and opposition and made a lot of money in oil deals with ISIS.
5447 2018-02-11 19:02:01 Yes & they help find a cheap insurance to match if you don’t have one & then anything that happens gets fixed free under the 3 yr warranty & oil changes only 5 dollars go sis
5448 2018-02-11 19:01:49 I was just oil pulling in the shower, I spit it out, and slipped right in that shit.... reminding myself that oil and water do NOT mix.
5449 2018-02-11 19:01:44 me: do u have any deodorant

5452 2018-02-11 19:01:22 It's about 60 dollars cheaper if ij do it myself I will never ever go to jiffylube again. I will never ever go to another place again to get my oil done.
5453 2018-02-11 19:01:17 Better check again. Red states take more from gov. More: food stamps, welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, farm subsidies, oil co. Subsidies, etc. They also have lower incomes, more unsafe work environments. Higher alcohol & drug use. You get the idea.
5454 2018-02-11 19:01:15 This new body oil smells like lemon macaroons
5455 2018-02-11 19:01:09 London. The Uk's richest most powerful city. Someone remind me what their largest export is? I can't see Jellied fckn Eels cutting it? Hands off Scottish exports. Oil, Whisky, Fish. #ScotRef #IndyRef2

5457 2018-02-11 19:01:04 My dad ordered something online for the first time by himself & somehow didn’t know the pain relief oil he bought is a marijuana pain relief 
5458 2018-02-11 19:00:55 It was interesting to see how plate tectonics plays a big role in the creation of oil and natural gas. #Oil#Petroleum#NaturalGas
5459 2018-02-11 19:00:27 I think Too much of oil in  தோசை
5460 2018-02-11 19:00:23 Or just a snake oil salesman.
5461 2018-02-11 19:00:23 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
5462 2018-02-11 19:00:22 Joel Osteen, like all of these televangelists, are just snake oil salesmen. Fuck them.
5463 2018-02-11 19:00:20 Doing a much needed detox bath with pine needle essential oil 
5464 2018-02-11 19:00:13 Dripping is the gold oil for Yorkshires but it's now a niche ingredient and super expensive. Me Dad used to have it on bread

5468 2018-02-11 18:59:58 you know I've asked my Labour Councillors for years to Fix Parking in #StocktononTees - so bad where I live - they even allow businesses to carry out trade on the streets!  Terrible when it means oil an debris all over your street - who cleans it up? Not the council believe me
5469 2018-02-11 18:59:56 You guys what castor oil do you guys use to grow your lashes?
5470 2018-02-11 18:59:55 So we can buy terrorists oil
5471 2018-02-11 18:59:54 Hefferan pp goal 4-1
5472 2018-02-11 18:59:52 I had already put that together. But he makes a fundamental flaw in his strategy, renewable energy. Coal is all but dead, and oil demand is decreasing. Electricity costs are tending towards free.... work in the Energy industry.
5473 2018-02-11 18:59:44 trust the oil of the future 
5474 2018-02-11 18:59:25 so then why are all oil stocks tanking?
5475 2018-02-11 18:59:03 I agree that this direction is the correct one for the future.  It's impossible for me to see a way through to it though, there has simply been far too much foreign investments into oil and gas, I think we have completely salvaged our sovereignty - reclamation would be painful.
5476 2018-02-11 18:58:59 Coconut Oil helps alleviate sugar withdrawal, tastes a bit sweet and the MCTs gives mental energy boost.
5477 2018-02-11 18:58:28 NIGERIANS SHOULD BE AWARDED BEST SPEAKERS OF MUMBO-JUMBO IF THEY ARE YET TO CONSTRUCT THEIR REFINERIES!HOW WOULD A NATION BLESSED WITH OIL CONTINUE TO IMPORT REFINED OIL?BUHARI CAN'T SUBSIDIZE ,BUHARI CAN'T CONSTRUCT REFINERIES!NONSENSE!
5478 2018-02-11 18:58:27 A white guy called me a terrorist because of my beard, but he’s the same guy who uses castor oil on his babyface to grow one too. Tf
5479 2018-02-11 18:58:27 Again I ask: will 1000 dollars pay your medical bills? Your mortgage? Will it send your children to college? Will it send a loved one to rehab for opioid addiction? Will it pay a dentist? Will it buy a car? Will it pay for heating oil? 

These are bribes. This is a CON JOB.
5480 2018-02-11 18:58:26 My afro stayed being dry, my skin didn't remain hydrated when using it. It is however amazing as a hot oil treatment before washing your hair.
5481 2018-02-11 18:57:45 Pasta, cheese, olive oil, salt and black pepper  @padzor
5482 2018-02-11 18:57:30 You'd think these Liberals took money from Alberta oil companies or something, the way they are fighting for Alberta.

5486 2018-02-11 18:56:53 I preferf olive oil, myself.
5487 2018-02-11 18:56:45 Sounds like oil and water
5488 2018-02-11 18:56:40 "Sunbathing in baby oil is the eating Tide Pods of our generation." -My mom
5489 2018-02-11 18:56:31 Makes you wonder why all the climate change nuts don’t try and shut down manufacturing and the pollution they create in the east like they are Alberta oil.
5490 2018-02-11 18:56:26 Coconut oil got way too much hype.
5491 2018-02-11 18:56:24 Not sure you understand the meaning of the word hypocrite. I've already said oil and gas are currently needed. I'm not advocating we blow up the tar sands tomorrow or ruin your job. But at some point, policy needs to reflect a change in priority.
5492 2018-02-11 18:56:24 That’s ‘The Truth’.
5493 2018-02-11 18:56:17 For #USA #Manbij +#Afrin are strategically meaningless. Strategically, only the #DeirEzzor province, with its oil reserves (about 50% of the Syrian reserves) is interesting. That is why the US is now building a new auxiliary force of Arabs (Islamists) there to finally drop YPG.
5494 2018-02-11 18:56:15 Cannabis Oil ...number one solution for headache pain
5495 2018-02-11 18:56:07 Sorry for the delay. Main ingredients of most items: gluten flour, nutritional yeast, soy, onion, garlic, (various other vegetables depending on the item), vegetable oil, many herbs and spices. If there's a particular thing you're allergic to/trying to avoid let me know.
5496 2018-02-11 18:56:02 89.99 for an oil change? Yea I’ll change it myself in the rain thanks  the hell kinda shit is that
5497 2018-02-11 18:55:53 Why is BC being blamed for Alberta boycotting BC wine? BC wants a review of the damage to our coast in the event of a spill, nobody seems to care about the coast and the revenue it brings to BC. They're all so worried about the revenues of a Texan oil company over BCians.
5498 2018-02-11 18:55:53 Oil employs about 200 thousand more than solar alone.
5499 2018-02-11 18:55:40 You don’t need to eat a thing to have a reaction to it in many cases. Peanut oil in the air can kill people.
5500 2018-02-11 18:55:17 I agree. The oil and gas industry association @OilGasCanada has been almost completely ineffective in countering disinformation and their message has not resonated with the public.
5501 2018-02-11 18:55:13 Gotta Get A Oil Change And A Whole Rim 
5502 2018-02-11 18:55:01 What happened to Khadaffi after he stopped selling oil in USD? What about Hussein when he did the same? Syria? Iran is the most recent regime who has threatened the same.. Coincidence?
5503 2018-02-11 18:54:50 Hoping that you are with oil and warmth sooner rather than later!
5504 2018-02-11 18:54:35 Many more 'blame the oil industry' hit pieces? Yes, there are hundreds of them and NOT ONE proves human causation of climate change. Too bad science is so difficult for some people.
5505 2018-02-11 18:54:17 I covered myself with coconut oil and wow I feel moisturized af
5506 2018-02-11 18:53:59 Getting my oil changed at Jiffy Lube and a see someone roll in with a Rolls...guess  he needed the 15 min change lol ...

5511 2018-02-11 18:53:16 How about Israel give back the OIL laden Golan Heights to the Syrian's? I don't need to hear pathetic excuses such as defense .. I see the theft of a nations resources!
5512 2018-02-11 18:53:08 Islam is not compatible with Western Civilization. Like mixing oil and water

5517 2018-02-11 18:52:22 I love the way your vehicle drives right after an oil change
5518 2018-02-11 18:52:06 Kinda wanna do an oil painting of berserk fanart but I don’t wanna be the weeb that I already am
5519 2018-02-11 18:51:43 Perhaps "Metis elder" hasn't read about how I debated a PhD Green Party member at the Vancouver Public Library in front of 150 Greenies, defending TMX and the oil sands May 2, 2017? Would love to know what he's done in BC to support TMX. *tick tock*
5520 2018-02-11 18:51:43 Back to this Honey + olive oil life. 
5521 2018-02-11 18:51:42 As I said earlier That I believe this WAR started when Cheney wanted to steal Iraqs oil it Actually started well before that when #USTerroristGovernment put the muslim radicals in power back in the mid to late 50s and those are just the ones I know about at the moment so think
5522 2018-02-11 18:51:30 This oil I made has my hair so soft omg.
5523 2018-02-11 18:51:21 Very nice. Next time light up a few Iranian oil refineries back home and bring the fight to their doorstep. To paraphrase Sharon...the Iranians have the oil but we have the match.

5533 2018-02-11 18:50:51 The Zombie Energy analysis uses extrapolates the G20 dataset to global subsidies to extraction of oil, gas & coal - and Jessica & Team ran a sensitivity analysis against it. But the Zombie Energy dataset does not have data on subsidies to electricity production from fossil fuels.

5535 2018-02-11 18:50:25 To be fair, he’s talking about trading Drai, with all the rumour mongering and upset that would cause with Oilers having him on the block. Bad idea for a franchise player.
5536 2018-02-11 18:50:15 Did your mummy never tell you, after she finished the oil change that good men don’t slut-shame women who refuse to do the oil change?
5537 2018-02-11 18:49:54 Spiked Gasoline or oil? Lol maybe a corrupted File
5538 2018-02-11 18:49:52 When is the oil running out of that shithole country?
5539 2018-02-11 18:49:23 Buying the league next year already?? Joke club, no fans, no history, oil money blah, blah, blah ................mind that gap now
5540 2018-02-11 18:49:21 Traitor is @WingsScotland. .

Not only to the UK but to the Scottish coastal fishing communities. ..

Nats harp on about Scottish not English oil ... but are happy to give their fish away to the EU and Norwegian fishing fleets

Mad ....
5541 2018-02-11 18:49:06 God! Seeing Hey, Look Me Over! @NYCityCenter and saw that they’re gonna do “Oil” from Wildcat and I squealed “oh, I can’t wait!” Guys, what I’m saying is this is made for me.
5542 2018-02-11 18:49:00 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
5543 2018-02-11 18:48:52 Two stage usually self proplld, can eat through 24 inch deep snow no problem, usually 4 cycle so just fill with gas no mixing oil and gas in advance. harder to transport. Toro is a reputable brand and they make both. Hope that helps.
5544 2018-02-11 18:48:52 Changing oil for the first time in the Cruze (dealership did it on the house for two years). Forgot how much fun it was.
5545 2018-02-11 18:48:43 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
5546 2018-02-11 18:48:37 Awe I know your pain . I drank caster oil and my little girl came the same day . But, everyone gave me hell about it
5547 2018-02-11 18:48:36 Single stage 2 cycle gas and oil mix easier to move around transport, usally not self propelled, cant handle seriously deep snow.
5548 2018-02-11 18:48:32 As long as it's coconut oil you'll be fine .
5549 2018-02-11 18:48:26 I just started this oil called wild growth. I want more length. I’m cutting off some blonde next week.
5550 2018-02-11 18:48:20 Massage some cocnut oil into those suckers. It's chemical free and antibacterial! Keeps my skin feeling soft too.
5551 2018-02-11 18:48:20 HE WAS ABOUT TO PUT A VASELINE ON HIS D BUT I TOLD HIM TO PUT MY OLIVE OIL INSTEAD 
5552 2018-02-11 18:48:15 What do you call people that are scared of science and education? Conservatives? Republicans? Big Oil? Politicians?
5553 2018-02-11 18:48:11 I've met too many bakers with breathing problems, general poor health and even emphysema. Brilliant that the HSE is taking this seriously. I keep flying flour to a minimum by 1) not throwing it around 2) using water, oil or just patience to work with wet doughs. Go, Slow Dough!
5554 2018-02-11 18:48:05 Me: I ordered some rose hip oil to the house let me know when it’s here dad: what? Why would you order rattlesnake oil?!! #dying #dad #hilarious
5555 2018-02-11 18:47:55 Funny...it looks like a Lucas Oil Stadium to me, too.
5556 2018-02-11 18:47:54 Has oil seen short term bottom chigirl
5557 2018-02-11 18:47:48 Had to spend an unexpected $500 on fucking brakes today after spending 400 on tires and oil change earlier this week 
5558 2018-02-11 18:47:22 Personally my main concern runs down to oil lock-in; if the end goal is decarbonisation, targeting our CCS tech development at fossil fuel extraction seems the wrong direction.
5559 2018-02-11 18:47:22 PEOPLE OVERSEAS&I DID AGAIN THIS TIME! I AM APPALLED THE TERRORISTS, ABUSED CHILDREN,CREATED VIA THE ARE STILL THREATENING&ARE STILL HARMING ME! I REALIZE OIL, IS A LOT OF , AS MY LOTTERIES,THREE OTHER INHERITANCES(1IS FROM MY MOTHER'S)
&LAWSUITS ARE A LOT OF , HOWEVER,
5560 2018-02-11 18:47:15 I spilled lemongrass essential oil on my floor and carpet next to my bed and the strong scent has given me a headache but instead of getting out bed and cleaning it I’ve been in bed suffering for 13 hours.
5561 2018-02-11 18:47:03 Ladies and germs, that right there is what I'm talking about. Only hydrocarbons are on the approved list of energy sources. The fact that I support Alberta oil and gas because of govt/industry responsible approach gets ignored. So, even when I conform, I'm unacceptable. Huh.
5562 2018-02-11 18:47:02 Federal Reserve Notes are propped up by oil sales and the fear of US military intervention. Aka 'The Petrodollar'.. You would be correct, 'if the rules were applied', but they aren't. The only thing that will crash the dollar is OPEC using a different medium of exchange.
5563 2018-02-11 18:46:46 You're broke because the oil you have is expensive to extract and the prices have plummetted. Also you rely entirely on oil for your wealth. Its your own mistakes that got you where you are.
5564 2018-02-11 18:46:43 LMFAOO & tbt to when we had 5% of  the oil thing alsoo LMFAOOO

5568 2018-02-11 18:45:51 Oil rigs coming online very aggressively that $60 has been effectively locked in for multiple years.  Spread between Brent vs WTI peaked at $8.50 premium now only $3.50 caps upside potential in theory
5569 2018-02-11 18:45:32 A fav but I pile parm in ctr of oil and jam into bread yummmmmm good choice
5570 2018-02-11 18:44:50 I completely forget I have a whole bottle of oil in my hair and now I have to go to work with oily hair because 
1. I am super lazy.
2. I won't wash my hair subha saweray.
3. It's cold.
4. idc.
5. Scarf FTW
5571 2018-02-11 18:44:31 The same hype that prompted Al-Falih's predecesor in late 2014 to reverse #Saudi oil policy for the first time since 1986?
5572 2018-02-11 18:44:25 Rosemary Olive Oil Chips= Suprisingly good.
5573 2018-02-11 18:44:23 You gotta go deeper, before you penetrate the camera slowly pans over to reveal you're watching rocky 3 and then the oil painting happens
5574 2018-02-11 18:44:13 I’ll stick to my olive oil and plus I don’t use gel anymore like that. Too heavy 
5575 2018-02-11 18:43:56 We have ports in Iran..
Used foreign policy well across..the world.
direct oil imports from America
Higher Foreign reserves..
And we have certainly enhanced global footprint..
Yes be critical..but stay close to truth

5583 2018-02-11 18:43:16 if u're too kysmyn to afford sk-ii products, just get urself 100% pure cold-pressed rosehip seed oil (trilogy, the ordinary, life flo).
rosehip oil is rich in essential fatty acids which are integral to healthy skin & it's actually great for oily acne-prone skin.
5584 2018-02-11 18:43:07 Are you bringing the baby oil?
5585 2018-02-11 18:42:55 Nice qualifier. Limiting pollution does not equate to claiming the world is ending. That was a nice sentence of propaganda for your anti-science, big oil overlords.
5586 2018-02-11 18:42:20 What if we don't need to protect oil interests? What if we rely on solar and wind for most of our energy? Will we still need to be at war in the Middle East? With Russia?
5587 2018-02-11 18:41:51 Lmao when I drain the water in the lil thing. I put oil butter and season the noodles. Then back in the pot
5588 2018-02-11 18:41:34 I didn't  idk why I didn't check the app first. NEVER GO TO VALVOLINE. $70 for an oil change

5597 2018-02-11 18:40:27 lol phew Thanks for letting me know, and you don't go sucking on your exhaust pipe or drinking carbon motor oil. Cheers

5599 2018-02-11 18:40:09 Tell me his "trick" is involving the oil somehow.
5600 2018-02-11 18:40:08 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
5601 2018-02-11 18:40:00 I get this... and ur better off with an oil.. and at night when u moisturise use aloe vera gel... the creams are blocking your pores and causing prickly heat as your sweat cant escape hope this helps i suffer with it badly and last time i went away i didnt get it xxx
5602 2018-02-11 18:39:48 Currently Getting My Oil Changed ,
5603 2018-02-11 18:39:42 Exactly!! The country with the commodity doesn't benefit, only the companies that privately own it do. The US thrives off civil wars and corruption in countries with oil because they don't have to buy it from that country, they just take it while citizens are preoccupied
5604 2018-02-11 18:39:24 Very... They are like water and oil ooo
5605 2018-02-11 18:39:24 And they can still s*** from anybody especially that no mother f****** oil

Because if they did I'm pretty sure they'll be trying to make gas and give it to me

Like here Ms Shevy. I have gas for u too.
5606 2018-02-11 18:39:16 Oil splash burn  it’s going to be a good one 
5607 2018-02-11 18:38:38 Yeah no big deal I drink watermelon water and diffuse peppermint essential oil
5608 2018-02-11 18:38:30 Japan's war machine was under total embargo of oil, coal, iron & rubber which they don't have domestic supplies of. Strategy was lightning conquest of resource rich Malaysia & Indonesia, then say "That's all we want. Let's do a cease-fire"
5609 2018-02-11 18:38:27 Be careful what you ask for .... one after the other are slowing going down the road of ruins by following this embarrassment of a president. And you, of all people, who can “read people”? Still learning the job I guess, good luck with that.
5610 2018-02-11 18:38:25 Art is the only thing you cannot punch a button for. You must do it the old-fashioned way. Stay up and really burn the midnight oil. There are no compromises.

5611 2018-02-11 18:38:20 I did a hydrating #prepoo #diy mix of aloe Vera gel, avocado oil and castor oil. I let it marinate for about 25 minutes and then I rinsed and shampoo with NourishMe Mint Cleanser.
5612 2018-02-11 18:38:14 End of the first
5613 2018-02-11 18:38:11 Thank you for fighting those who want to destroy our environment! The future is solar, not oil, not coal, not bringing back whale oil.... #TheResistance
5614 2018-02-11 18:38:01 Did you use the default oil brush for fur or some other?
5615 2018-02-11 18:37:48 As a SF Giants fan the Oilers season is eerily similar to the season the Giants had. Projected playoff team with lots of talent, but only 1 star had a good season.  Good offseason moves make them better.  Oil needs to do the same.
5616 2018-02-11 18:37:36 use manuka oil. my skin’s really sensitive and it worked sooo good you don’t even know.
5617 2018-02-11 18:37:32 Proof please.While ur at check out Trump Foundtn buying oil painting of himself,pays his litigations,helmet etc
5618 2018-02-11 18:37:10 But I grant you I should write “fossil fuels” are finite and not “oil is finite”. I’m not against biofuels of course. It’s simply not the silver bullet you imagine.
5619 2018-02-11 18:37:06 Another one bites the oil 
5620 2018-02-11 18:37:04 How'd that adventure w the cod liver oil go Sarah !!!!
5621 2018-02-11 18:36:52 Oh Johnny Boy... Oil is dead! Green is alive!  Dinosaurs are dead, as are your assertions!
5622 2018-02-11 18:36:50 The first ones always shit you gotta break the pan in with the first one. Non stick pan a little oil. Really really runny mix. Go for it again. Then try Yorkshire puds.

@markyoungtruth @POTUS THE BLACK MALE THAT BUSH ALLEGEDLY USED TO GO OVERSEAS TO GET WHOSE OIL!!? STOLEN OIL OF MY BROTHERS!

5624 2018-02-11 18:36:27 Give your head a shake. How much equalization money has Alberta paid in and Quebec taken out that has paid for your social programs? Alberta has paid in over $200 Billion mostly from oil revenue while Quebec sucks out $10 Billion a year
Kill Alberta oil and slit your own throats
5625 2018-02-11 18:35:58 You mean if it means we can ensure one of our top 5 oil importers continue to do so unimpeded?
5626 2018-02-11 18:35:50 They are all in the tank together and something tells me Syria & Middle East oil and money are at the bottom of it all.
5627 2018-02-11 18:35:39 I don't doubt it. I have my own sources that support your conspiracy. I think the US is indeed fighting to keep the $ as the trading currency for oil, and more.... it's pretty dark. But the Q is, has it penetrate #FATCA, if so, we are F***ed
5628 2018-02-11 18:35:27 I have coconut oil.  Thanks!
5629 2018-02-11 18:35:20 @NipunChopra7 hope the 11 do ok this year but might not been the right time to go to lucas oil.

5633 2018-02-11 18:34:40 Dear Texas, We need to have a serious conversation about your weather fluctuations. Please go get an oil change or take some midol, whatever will get you to pick a season for longer than 24 hours. Kthx.
5634 2018-02-11 18:34:39 Honestly any shampoo and the protein hair mayonnaise and cantu . The key is castor oil for me
5635 2018-02-11 18:34:27 U no be Edo guy
5636 2018-02-11 18:34:23 i forget what oil it is (extra virgin?) but if you massage it into your scalp and tilt your head upside down your hair will grow faster. apparently you see a difference after a month
5637 2018-02-11 18:34:19 Yh idk about coconut oil but petroleum based products in ur hair is real error.
5638 2018-02-11 18:34:18 "Two hour wait for an oil change?! Maybe that Barnes and Noble around the corner is still open. Are they still in business?"

*Goes around corner, B&N is so packed I barely find a seat*

I realize I'm very disconnected from a lot of every day things some times.
5639 2018-02-11 18:34:10 Rosemary oil is a fav

5642 2018-02-11 18:33:49 Oil
Brent crude fell by US$2.02 or 3.1% to US$62.79 a barrel. The US Nymex price fell by US$1.95 or 3.2% to US$59.20 a barrel. Over the week Brent lost 8.4% and Nymex fell 9.5%.

5645 2018-02-11 18:33:37 I’ve never seen it used. I just assumed it had oil or something like that. Never thought they’d shoot something at you. That’s... not a great way to get a good tip.
5646 2018-02-11 18:33:34 @BrittneyNKelly hey! Saw in your snap story that you use some type of edible in a syringe.. was just curious, is it CBD oil? I have stuff like that called Rick Simpson Oil.
5647 2018-02-11 18:33:34 Me too! I was older! I just don’t get the point of doing it on baby hairs that will eventually.... fall out? And at that age their scalp is extremely sensitive and gives direct access to a developing brain. So castor oil/coconut oil and all that should be a no no

5654 2018-02-11 18:32:25 I love that Simon Bridges uses his own hair as an advert for the Oil Industry.
5655 2018-02-11 18:32:22 this oil gotta go.
5656 2018-02-11 18:32:18 Hockey fans from anywhere turn of their team if they’re having a down season. I think the bigger issue was the HNIC panel suggesting the Oil move on from Leon last night.
5657 2018-02-11 18:32:18 Makes me want to make them all safe: open the breaches, remove ammo and magazines, and put trigger locks on all of them.  If necessary, clean them too and put a light coat of oil.  Then lock them up.
5658 2018-02-11 18:32:12 Every man woman and children get a yearly check for oil profits.  You want BC land? BC families should recieve the same for oil transport
5659 2018-02-11 18:32:11 Sanctions are hurting them but won’t derail them. But if cheap oil persists 10 years for a general majority of that time the country will fall apart and you’ll have a gigantic nation with no government.
5660 2018-02-11 18:31:57 So I put some oil in my hair last night after my shower and it looks shiny and fluffy today :')

5664 2018-02-11 18:30:52 What we do domestically and what other countries do are different. The pipelines are meant for EXPORT. EIA had determined that oil will be needed for the next few decades.

5671 2018-02-11 18:30:03 cos despite the popularity in recent years, coconut oil is still an OIL and is bad for skin lol
5672 2018-02-11 18:29:57 They’re doing a bit better recently (foreign reserves growing) because oil’s gone up, but that’s a hidden part of our economy as well. If oil rises, we will pass them as the top producer! I don’t see sanctions derailing Putin. He has to be challenged everywhere on the map.
5673 2018-02-11 18:29:52 All over the bad tooth Jode! Text me if you need the clove oil xoxoxo
5674 2018-02-11 18:29:43 That's because almost every major government worldwide printed money out of thin air and threw it into the system like oil on water. In a desperate attempt to make it seem like their economies are ok. Prolonging the inevitable. Scary stuff the last 10 years!
5675 2018-02-11 18:29:29 Last year our PM was the first sitting PM to give the keynote speech at the biggest oil convention in the world, then next day he was presented with the key to the city of Dallas,  and media says PMJT dosnt speak up for Canadian oil lol
5676 2018-02-11 18:29:17 The A39 between #Falmouth and #Truro specifically Playing Place to Arch Hill is currently closed due to a large oil spill. The road will likely be closed for the next hour or so. Please find an alternative route.
5677 2018-02-11 18:29:03 Flour and oil
5678 2018-02-11 18:29:01 Don’t forget the internal enemies, big oil &gas, big money and other big companies who want monopolistic power. They want to have unfettered ability to get special tax treatment and little/no regulations that would interfere with bigger profits.
5679 2018-02-11 18:28:52 Same old shite, Max, if I don't conform to the accepted narrative, if I don't use the approved talking points, then I'm fake news, a "journalist," an "environmentalist masquerading as an oil and gas reporter." Damn the facts. Ignore the solid reporting.
5680 2018-02-11 18:28:52 Irrevocable Acts by Jonnie Hyde-courageous old woman goes rogue to fight big oil
5681 2018-02-11 18:28:48 One thing that doesn’t feel right to me is that they claim they will transition to a decentralized exchange. Sounds like snake oil to me.
5682 2018-02-11 18:28:39 -50 wind chill today and tonight. Were still moving oil. Buck up pilgrim, you'll make it thru the slushy rain. 
Maga!!!
5683 2018-02-11 18:28:38 Other countries benefit Hugely from privately owned resources. Look at the oil industry in the USA.
5684 2018-02-11 18:28:21 Dawn dish soap and a touch of olive oil is what I use. The soap cleans it really well and the oil helps keep them soft
5685 2018-02-11 18:28:19 Ur head get Oil
5686 2018-02-11 18:28:16 In

This is the God for Donald Trump
5687 2018-02-11 18:28:13 I need to start using coconut oil
5688 2018-02-11 18:27:54 1/3 Looking through my list of stock/shares and am wondering why some companies like DAAR communicatn, Dunlop, Japaul oil&Marine have refused to even ‘move’ in the space of 3 years. Same exact value!
5689 2018-02-11 18:27:53 Rep. Meadows is actually correct this time. The GOP caved in big time. If Obama had still be in office Ryan and McConnell would have been running away from this budget deal. Remember that Trump is not a Republican nor a conservative. He is an opportunist and snake oil salesman.
5690 2018-02-11 18:27:43 ...protection, munitions contracts BIG OIL, I give upTax cuts r all sbout greed &top .5%. Its about money &many of these peeps r money launderers like Trump( read  Collusion). So Russian banks & oligarchs r involved as well. This scandal is so huge & the fact #GOP
TaxScam...
5691 2018-02-11 18:27:38 Who are we? The rest of the sheep out there like you? The ones with no REAL answers? Just more fairy tales about wind power and solar? I’m afraid oil is here to stay.
5692 2018-02-11 18:27:34 Try a lavender essential oil and a saline rinse a couple times a day. Use warm/hot water.
5693 2018-02-11 18:27:04 DO IT!!! ive been using SS on my trouble areas and then Derma E radiant face oil or smth everywhere else for hydration and aloe as my moisturizer at night.. girl lemme tell u
5694 2018-02-11 18:26:53 ...lose with programs & agencies gutted to save tax dollars. This is HUGE issue, and when citizens do feel it, it will be disastrous and potentially life-threatening. It will certainly mean the crippling of art, science and recreational activities. Less public land, more gas/oil.

5696 2018-02-11 18:26:31 What does this mean for crude oil prices?
5697 2018-02-11 18:26:03 Absolutely not...it is flawed data to suggest inferior fats and/or foods made in a factory, like margarine, are superior to high quality fats like GF butter, coconut oil or avocados

5699 2018-02-11 18:25:50 No one really believes in things when they put a lot of thought into it.
5700 2018-02-11 18:25:46 @DoddieWeir5  my dad is going through the same as you.  Have you looked in to using cannibis oil ? Lots of US articles but not many UK.  Hope you’re doing ok x
5701 2018-02-11 18:25:45 vic really made me hit a oil pen. Kid said keep inhaling til it starts blinking & it never did  I almost died
5702 2018-02-11 18:25:34 Yep, in all seriousness, the players, coaches, anyone who helps the club operate @ that world class of a level deserve all credit in world. Just need ammunition to keep City fans in check this spring. Pointing out the barrels of oil money that fueled titles 4 em will have to do
5703 2018-02-11 18:25:16 If you use olive oil for lube during sex can you tell people you're still a virgin? Asking for a friend.
5704 2018-02-11 18:25:02 Mullen short handed at 12:15 of the first
5705 2018-02-11 18:25:01 1-0 Oilers on a goal from Hatch
5706 2018-02-11 18:25:00 I just don't get why people honestly believed the Oilers were capable of going out on the Cali trip and sweeping.  I understand the never give up on your team mentality but come on. There was nothing to suggest that was ever going to be a possibility.
5707 2018-02-11 18:24:46 ITS NOT HARD..health care for all,equal pay for same work,Aborition is legal,no christian law, no propery tax for veterans,Health care for veterans,dollar for dollar trade,equal rights to vote,clean air,water,no oil drilling on ANY COAST. so hell yea i got a message
5708 2018-02-11 18:24:31 120$ oil change

5709 2018-02-11 18:24:26 I’m quick to find a coupon for an oil change

5711 2018-02-11 18:24:15 Stream will be happening today...finally getting a oil change done on my vehicle
5712 2018-02-11 18:24:10 Always good to hear friends and family doing good
5713 2018-02-11 18:23:40 i dont feel like finding a bunch of photos but my fursona smells like motor oil, rust and wild animal

5715 2018-02-11 18:23:30 Go and drill it na. Abi na the sales from the northern oil dem use ransom them?
5716 2018-02-11 18:23:27 Oat cakes  (the waitrose ones have no palm oil).
5717 2018-02-11 18:23:17 All the so called green power sources are heavily dependent on hydro carbons and mining intensive businesses to be viable. Try again Terry and to prove how committed you are do one thing and one only. Commit today to stop driving on any highways made with oil.
5718 2018-02-11 18:23:15 Tbh they serve them in a puddle of oil so my opinion may be more balanced if I'd ever had them served properly
5719 2018-02-11 18:23:09 In no particular order the main reasons US military are illegally in Syria are: control of the oil; regional destabilisation... which means huge weapons and munitions sales; to keep Isreal happy. Same old game play.
5720 2018-02-11 18:23:07 You WCE doesn’t know how to use Spray and Cook Olive Oil. She cooks the food then spray them 
5721 2018-02-11 18:23:01 Putin also wanted sanctions lifted. His economy was at the point in 2012 where many thought the government may not make it another 10 years. Since then oil is cheaper, there are more sanctions not less snd he’s killing their GDP to project strength in FP
5722 2018-02-11 18:22:41 Ok so I need to get an oil change tomorrow for sure.
5723 2018-02-11 18:22:19 I enjoyed his "free" concert in gulf shores to benefit the oil spill. However, the only type of alcoholic beverages served were Landsharks. Jimmy probably did really well that day
5724 2018-02-11 18:22:12 Ya, probably not likely with this government. They have produced oil in the past. They are land based and not off-shore, although it is close. Not buying into it yet but will be interested.
5725 2018-02-11 18:21:59 Degree of climate change impact known to those that are not blinded by oil or factose intolerant.
5726 2018-02-11 18:21:55 When the oil popping
5727 2018-02-11 18:21:54 Nice oil in to the air conditioning system. Those fumed can be dangerous
5728 2018-02-11 18:21:48 It's definitely not supposed to taste like old oil. Please send us a DM.
5729 2018-02-11 18:21:35 Biosilk! & Coconut oil
5730 2018-02-11 18:21:24 Hang in there girl! I have been washing with African black soap, I also been dippin a cottonball in ACV and dabbin that on my face (stings a lil) and then coconut oil as a moisturizer afterwards..also tried tea tree oil too

5735 2018-02-11 18:20:59 His and his fathers terroristic threats should have been delt with long ago. They threw money, oil, and other goods at him that help possibly to fund our demise. People are not smart enough to see this, they want to turn a blind eye, and now its to late. Finally some1 that will..
5736 2018-02-11 18:20:37 I’ve been using coconut oil to take my makeup off lately, it’s working for me.
5737 2018-02-11 18:20:32 Say no to eau de toilettes and eau de colognes...lowest levels of oil
5738 2018-02-11 18:20:32 And that will change the price we get for oil how? We pay a reduced rate now, because only pipelines we have are going south. So exactly how would that help? Not to mention the huge increase in costs we would have if we separated. I know it’s hard for you cons to think, but try.
5739 2018-02-11 18:20:29 I think you can sterilise the garlic with pastureisation and keep it in the fridge for no more than a week. Or, somehow extract the garlicy essence and out that in the oil. The botulism is in the cloves. Anyway, I may be misremembering this advice, I am not a food scientist
5740 2018-02-11 18:20:21 Getting my oil changed. I can’t wait for the guy to come back and tell me everything wrong with my car lmao
5741 2018-02-11 18:20:07 If no bacon & no brining, then get as much fat (olive oil/butter/bacon grease) and salt under the skin over the meat as possible.

5744 2018-02-11 18:19:41 I have used Thuja essential oil & tincture before, it DOES work!
5745 2018-02-11 18:19:38 NO body gives a fuck what you think . Real fans only please
5746 2018-02-11 18:19:35 Good thinking! I got the Kirkland Italy on the Toxinless recommendation list and it tastes very good. But have used that California brand for years. Costco also has a good avocado oil

5749 2018-02-11 18:18:48 So you are not aware wind and solar are already cheaper than oil to produce energy? Maybe you should update your facts Data.
5750 2018-02-11 18:18:37 Also pure mango shea butter, sweet almond oil, and jojoba oil are great for moisturizing without all of the harmful preservatives and fragrances. I’m working on my own lotion recipe for my business. Once I get it mastered I’d love to send you a sample! All my products are vegan.

5755 2018-02-11 18:17:22 This happened to me once while driving on the loop after I got my oil changed and they didn’t close my hood all the way!! It was the scariest shit 
5756 2018-02-11 18:17:18 Hopefully you understand how inefficient and silly making oil is?
5757 2018-02-11 18:17:07 I’m obsessed with putting oils on my face.

Before i go to bed, i apply oil. When i wake up, i wash my face and apply oil again before yoga. Then i have my bath and apply oil AGAIN then wait a bit before makeup.
5758 2018-02-11 18:17:01 Shoutout to the @walmart location on highway 6 in Houston. I had to drive all the way to Houston just for an oil change. & the guy who did it was excellent. He filled my tires up and vacuumed my car as well. Something @DiscountTire in Richmond, Tx didnt wanna do.
5759 2018-02-11 18:16:53 Exploration must take place in the north ...
And why are u sad that oil was discoverd in the north..
5760 2018-02-11 18:16:49 They pulled support because of that father but otherwise were okay with this voodoo/wellness snake oil group?
5761 2018-02-11 18:16:32 not face shaving but I've heard coconut oil is really good for sensitive areas!
5762 2018-02-11 18:16:24 Olive oil, salt, pepper, and roast it in the oven for a little while

5766 2018-02-11 18:15:54 You may want to have a little Google about home made garlic oil, I think there is a significant risk of botulism :/
5767 2018-02-11 18:15:44 あ、そうなの（無知）
5768 2018-02-11 18:15:42 sorry i cant make it to class tomorrow im trapped in an oil painting
5769 2018-02-11 18:15:41 I had a guy at Walmart ask me out one time after changing my oil and I was like “um I’m not 18” and he went oh well that’s ok like GET OUTTA HERE 
5770 2018-02-11 18:15:22 Nope but I don't see them being used in that role. Still think if they're all here, they'll be used inside the top six more often than not. Now if we removed the $6M they're paying that guy on the wing...
5771 2018-02-11 18:15:19 Well then look at trading Nuge if it such a concern. My point being is don't cut 29 out of the combination.
5772 2018-02-11 18:15:05 Ok let me say this we display people from many of these countries that the foreign aid goes to, we have stolen oil and gold in recent times, lived off many of the poorest in these countries yet your mad about the amount we send really 
5773 2018-02-11 18:15:03 I am showered and my hair is no longer dripping coconut oil.
That’s the worst part about it. Perhaps I put too much on haha
5774 2018-02-11 18:15:02 Is the tournament held in a pool of body oil at the YMCA?
5775 2018-02-11 18:14:59 What a joke!.... He let his Son die because of his stupid home remedies, now he’s allowed to promote his “ Snake oil “ to others? .... Disgraceful!
5776 2018-02-11 18:14:54 Honestly research how it was decided that lead should be removed from gasoline. Big oil and government used these exact tactics then when they didn't believe the scientist about that. Look at the extent they went to attempting to discredit those scientists. smh Have a good day
5777 2018-02-11 18:14:37 Bio oil gw udah abis dong yasallam:(
5778 2018-02-11 18:14:35 My thoughts: 1)The oil miss nuge - he cant be traded. 2)maroon shouldnt be on the 1st line. 3)lucic should be on the 3rd line 4)kassian deserves more ice. 5)happy with strome overall. 6)russell is a good defenseman. 7)why no early focus? 8)Mclellan looks stressed - hope he's ok.
5779 2018-02-11 18:14:31 Sallow skin, hook nose, yellow, treacherous and, of course, oil/grease. So I bring this up not to slander Rowling, but to underscore just how common/available these images have always been throughout literary history.

5782 2018-02-11 18:14:20 Exactly. I've been watching oil markets,down. Because of Russian oil? I can't be sure but pipeline to China finished,oil flowing. Fracking needs $25 barrell to cover cost. Keep oil low,fracking can't compete. Gold-backed petro ruble,gold-backed petro yuan.
5783 2018-02-11 18:14:12 Germany and much of Europe are also currently susceptible to energy blackmail from Putin due to their dependence on Russian natural gas. I also support eliminating coal and oil, I just don’t see a viable alternative currently other than nuclear.  Gas is only a short term bridge
5784 2018-02-11 18:13:57 Hay señora yo tengo un equipo cerealero y le pido por favor que no hable de lo qué no sabe ni entiende traficar 3 tn de soja  a Brasil no se puede hacer con el costo de GAS oil aunque te la regalen es inviable me duele su ignorancia .

5788 2018-02-11 18:13:48 @RZRForum The person who came up with using a allen wrench on the drain plug should be fired. Polaris should issue a cold chisel with a purchase so we can change oil in these razors. Must be a money maker for them at $32 a piece to rpeace the drain plug. I have 2 RZR'S
5789 2018-02-11 18:13:39 This morning I got an oil change by myself for the first time and realized how stupid I am when it comes to cars.
5790 2018-02-11 18:13:37 わぁ！ありがとうございます。リラックスしたいけど、アロマ系何使っていいかわからなくて困ってました。しかもSupport Supersensitive Body Oil は家族みんなで使えそうで早く試したい。
5791 2018-02-11 18:13:35 Ha, I'm all for pointing out here & there that the title was made possible by untold billion$$$$ in oil money... but you still gotta spend it right, and coach needs to handle personalities, etc... and they've done all that. So fair play (relatively speaking) to City.
5792 2018-02-11 18:13:20 Well, for one the sanctions- no penalty for election hacking, 2ndly the oil pipeline. There are many things that payback Putin. Money laundering comes with a price.
5793 2018-02-11 18:13:16 The deadline for making huge decisions about my future falls on the same day I need an oil change, I don't know which is more stressful at this point.
5794 2018-02-11 18:13:15 Snake oil salesmen
5795 2018-02-11 18:13:08 Mr @BobGodec we know you are after our oil in Turkana. We will not allow you to scoop that oil. Accept and move on.
5796 2018-02-11 18:13:07 That’s cool, and I appreciate the invite. I’m sure once the toxicology report comes back, you’ll find that it wasn’t CBD oil... it’s just a shame there wasn’t more thought put into the original statement that your dept. released. I’ve written all the news outlets to revisit this
5797 2018-02-11 18:13:06 Happy for that too, no amount is too much to save a life let alone some lives, @NGRPresident risked their lives to search for oil in that area while having not defeated Boko Haram
5798 2018-02-11 18:13:06 @BobGodec you want to grab Turkana oil with the help of an illegitimate administration? Lol

My husband: "Well maybe, I might just have a frozen burrito". 

Me: "I still love you."

My husband: "I know."
5804 2018-02-11 18:12:28 You must try coconut oil and bicarbonate of soda..
5805 2018-02-11 18:12:27 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
5806 2018-02-11 18:12:15 You are only concerned about getting re-elected in a conservative province with an economy that is fossil fuel based. The south coastal waters of BC should not be sacrificed for your ambition. For our descendants show real leadership & leave tarsands oil in ground! #bcpoli
5807 2018-02-11 18:12:06 @Kiehls ... Plz explain why your airport stores don’t offer allow you to gain rewards? I’m a faithful steward of your products (I.e. I love the oil infused conditioner, every1 go buy it!!)I thought, I deserve a new product whilst on my travels but no rewards is a dealbreaker fam.
5808 2018-02-11 18:12:05 If we could move Klef for a similar type of right handed d I would have something to consider. But not for a winger. Maybe for Tyson Barrie? Or Risto out of Buffalo.

5810 2018-02-11 18:11:53 well I’ve been smoking daily for years now. but recently I’ve started taking very small amounts of cbd oil and frequently using a topical pain relief cbd ointment for my nerve pain. I also eat edibles when available. it’s mainly illegal in NY so it’s weird

5816 2018-02-11 18:11:12 That is a HUGE ENDEAVOR. US dollar controls  65% of world trade and 100% of oil trade. This calls 4 reorganizing world trade which only happens with the collapse of 1st Economy or War. Do not see this objective within our reach. #FATCA
5817 2018-02-11 18:11:05 The moment you told these guys there is oil in Turkana is the moment you invited bullshit .
5818 2018-02-11 18:11:00 So a government thought the best way to “empower women” was to give them a bag of rice, cooking oil and N5,000 starting capital.

5820 2018-02-11 18:10:53 plus eventually our oil reserves will run out, then what?
5821 2018-02-11 18:10:51 Are you in Utah? Utah is the birthplace of all the pyramid scheme oil companies. Don’t talk to them! You’ll end up on the bottom of their pyramid!
5822 2018-02-11 18:10:48 Tbh they serve them in a puddle of oil so my opinion may be more balanced if I'd ever had them served properly
5823 2018-02-11 18:10:42 Love to mix frankincense and myrrh with a carrier oil and use as perfume or cologne instead of putting toxins from store bought perfume on my body. It has a great earthy scent!

5825 2018-02-11 18:10:36 Because of the individual looking at making the moves...

5827 2018-02-11 18:10:35 So I overheard this girl talk about putting coconut oil on her face for her acne problems. I was so tempted to hip her but her friend told her that it’ll helps. 

I walked away because it’s not my business to teach her how to pick friends.

5837 2018-02-11 18:09:35 If technology reduces jobs, that is consistent across any industry.  Would love to hear politicians stand for the success of the Oil and Gas sector and at the same time Collaborate on ways of reducing environmental impact.  Rational vs Emotional.  Rational does not win elections

5854 2018-02-11 18:06:44 "Find out the facts from the original person"... right, whose limited acquaintance with facts led to his son's death. This event organizer admits he seeks controversial speakers. I guess controversy gets free advertising for his snake oil show.
5855 2018-02-11 18:06:40 I gotta get my oil change this weekend
5856 2018-02-11 18:06:27 Use nail oil. Mine took ages to get back. Still not right!
5857 2018-02-11 18:06:24 Natural hair isn’t really that expensive though. If you just wash it every other day, condition, cut the split ends & oil it then you’re pretty much good. No need to go all craaazy with the fancy hair products.

5859 2018-02-11 18:06:19 Sad to appoint a Turkana minister for oil then make him deny his own people a fair share of the profits. When the Turkana people will question the decision, Uhuru Kenyatta will cynically deny making it. It's callous in the extreme

5869 2018-02-11 18:05:21 Try a cloth  with cinnamon or clove oil  on it . Wave it jently. So not get it on your face.
5870 2018-02-11 18:05:14 When did the republicans become the party of government jobs?  I thought government jobs were bad and we were supposed to be reducing our countries dependence on them. Why are we picking winners and losers in our economy through military and prison and oil contracts and permits?
5871 2018-02-11 18:05:06 My cousin ran a 6.0 for nearly 400 k until it was stolen.  Infrequent oil changes, and no other maintance.  It pissed coolant 2 times on him when something plugged inside, about 5 hours Labour both times to fix and a tow bill.  Other then that problem free

5876 2018-02-11 18:04:24 Penne is better as a side pasta, preferably with oil and garlic. If you’re baking, it is ziti all the way. I feel like this pasta has done enough that it stands on its own without being sullied by any recent headlines.
5877 2018-02-11 18:04:19 Yes idk why maybe it’s just me but I think they taste better + aren’t soggy + haven’t burnt them yet & always do when I use oil
5878 2018-02-11 18:04:00 I create the best facial masks. Today I created coconut oil and green tea with with woolies earth friendly foaming face wash.

5880 2018-02-11 18:03:55 Coconut oil is so terrible for your face !! Actual worst ! Shea  butter too. In fact any oil . It’s way too heavy

5882 2018-02-11 18:03:50 Also, what about defense contractors? I don't want my name on the bombs slaughtering millions of innocent people. Internet technology for monopolies? Pharmaceutical R&D? Corn subsidies? Oil subsidies. Rabbit hole. Heritage Foundation's ACA is more of the same.
5883 2018-02-11 18:03:45 The Sunday but doesn’t make much difference. Hoping to have oil again by Thursday.

5901 2018-02-11 18:02:12 I wonder why Kenney never mentioned the USA‽ probably because he’s on their side! you guys got a look at this man! Jason Kenney should be fuming mad that the USA has our oil and gas landlocked! USA is the problem folks!

5917 2018-02-11 18:00:11 Cooking would be less painful if I didn't have to do laundry and take a shower afterwards because everything smells like garlic and oil. Takes 2 hours to cook, an hour to clean up, and another 2 hours to do laundry. And for what? Food????
5918 2018-02-11 18:00:05 Lavender oil on the inside of your wrists. Or behind your ears or in your chest. Or all three.

5924 2018-02-11 17:59:11 eh butuh nak tanya ni. Ganja masuk dalam minuman macam sintetik ada ke bodoh selain hemp oil
5925 2018-02-11 17:58:59 Those of us who think China as bold & undeterent power should think again .China has always been detered when oppsn has been resolute. Case in pt is India's Doklam, Japan's no to fly zone in ECS, South Korea THAAD msl instalment , Vietnam oil exploration .All against China.
5926 2018-02-11 17:58:39 I need to start putting oil on my hair again
5927 2018-02-11 17:58:37 Unsure why Mexican National oil company pursues a presence in Jack London but we’ll continue to advocate for walking and biking as superior forms of urban mobility!
5928 2018-02-11 17:58:24 Gear oil is the worst.
5929 2018-02-11 17:58:08 Full stop, I see where you’re going with this. You don’t care about sanctions just oil. The two administrators are on polar ends of that debate. Trump has opened exploration, regressing alternative energy initiatives so we have to remain relient on old technology.

5938 2018-02-11 17:57:40 Roasted, face down, with a little water in the pan. Or sliced into crescents, tossed with oil and minced garlic, and roasted high. Eat the skin, too!
5939 2018-02-11 17:57:37 Seems they've been promised oil in turkana....says why a ministry has been created to specifically do oil biz. Sad

Our dog got so wound up by the continuous explosions he got out of his cage and attacked the only thing at his level. A 4l bottle of vegetable oil.
He is still ill from ingesting and inhaling the oil.

5965 2018-02-11 17:53:11 does that mean we have to lay down and accept the destruction of our west coast? I would rather suffer a cut off of oil and learn how to live without it, than let our coast be destroyed for the next few thousand years. value added is a must.

6007 2018-02-11 17:47:27 1. Gas, oil and plastic all far easier to produce from hemp also paper and medicine. The only reason we still use oil is greed of money by the people who stand to gain from it. They don't give two fucks about anything else.
6008 2018-02-11 17:47:24 But it’s not oil so Trump will fight you every step.

6015 2018-02-11 17:46:57 And make sure you ask for all the oil deals trump has with Russia because his son said, before the campaign, most of their income is from their deals with Russia.  From little trump's own mouth.

6024 2018-02-11 17:45:58 And that's where we disagree. The roster is flawed and unless Oilers get Venzina-type goaltending they are not a contender. Roster is good enough to be in the playoff mix but that's about it.
6025 2018-02-11 17:45:41 The best thing for your beard is time. Keeping it hydrated with oil or balm, increasing exercise to boost testosterone, and eating leafy greens can all encourage healthy growth, but only fills in the gaps of what your body is capable of naturally. Patience is the key.

6027 2018-02-11 17:45:35 It doesn’t rape the land as much as ugly strip mining. Look up diamond, copper, lithium mining. Fugly stuff. And only a small position of Kinder is for heavy oil, mostly is gas. Cleanest of all.
6028 2018-02-11 17:45:34 Shut down toxic plants producing toxic products and refit them to produce non-toxic products woth lower toxic emitting processes...what a terrible idea.

If you read my reply, the only reason it's difficult to use non-petrolium plastics is because of big oil lobbies and economies of scale amd scope.
6039 2018-02-11 17:43:21 At least more advanced technology for oil extraction today can reduce the number of deaths from 90 000 American miners that died from coal mining accidents in the 20th century! It is safer today, but still poses threats to other species, the environment, and our health! #Lesson5
6040 2018-02-11 17:43:20 I have this exact issue..’the ordinary’ products are amazing, & you can just apply different products for different areas. I use hyaluronic acid on acne prone areas to prevent it, & salicylic acid to get rid of actual spots. I use their rosehip oil on dry patches.Good luck

6047 2018-02-11 17:42:23 Don't expect to pay less than $5/litre for fuel, don't expect ferries, trains & planes to run. We are net importers of refined fuels. We need to refine our oil at home. End of story. Like raw logs, if they can't be milled here, don't cut them down, same goes for oil.

6071 2018-02-11 17:39:42 You are most often desperately wrong, but you just might be right about that; after all, many of the best BC wineries were founded by Albertans and are owned by Albertans. Just one of the many benefits of Canada’s oil and gas industry.

6073 2018-02-11 17:39:22 The dilbit sank in Kalamazoo because the spill occurred during a massive storm when the river had historically high sediment levels and the oil formed OPAs. Any hydrocarbon would have behaved the same way. It is in the chemistry.
6074 2018-02-11 17:39:18 I've been drawing for years but I never was fond of coloring. The only coloing medium I'm good with is oil pastel and that's probably because of my previous school projects and contests I joined always required oil pastels lol
6075 2018-02-11 17:39:08 I had to get oil last night and when I went into orileys this guy who’s been flirting with me was in there with all his friends and you bet he messaged me as soon as I got home telling me how gorgeous I am
6076 2018-02-11 17:38:58 I'm just good with my mouth lmao slicker den a can uh oil feel me
6077 2018-02-11 17:38:40 Yes and no, one perspective that could be forgiving to his household chores laziness: Do you help change the oil on the cars, do you clean his garage, kill spiders, yard work, etc? Lol 
Not at all that women aren’t capable but it’s mainly guys responsibility.

6079 2018-02-11 17:38:36 Maybe Weaver could take his "oceans" concern and get cruise ships to self clean their waste.  Now they dump it into the oceans DAILY.  The hypocracy is so difficult to u/stand.  Daily poo in ocean is fine, a CHANCE of an oil spill No???
6080 2018-02-11 17:38:36 CCS for coal power and fossil fuel plants seems like a white elephant, huge internal power loads, very expensive, failed projects - Kemper, Boundary Dam, Gorgon etc. EOR looks like an oil industry Trojan horse. CCS still important for cement, industrial applications.
6081 2018-02-11 17:38:08 America is been used by it's elites to conduct wars that have no benefit to the US.
The only groups who benefits are the Sunni suicide fanatics and Wahabis.American blood for Saudi controlled oil cartels.

6093 2018-02-11 17:37:22 Can either of you read? My initial tweet referred to the the necessity of oil and gas to a certain degree. The opposition from me comes from EXPANSION of it.

6098 2018-02-11 17:37:06 And Russia and Saudi and norway and usa are building new refineries and pipelines while we're arguing whether oil will be used in 20 years. If I had a competitor i would try my hardest to ensure they cant sell their product or can only sell for a fraction of global price.
6099 2018-02-11 17:37:05 1) Jason, can you put pressure on the NDP and all the oil companies in Western Canada to start a well funded campaign to “sell” our energy sector. Massive ad campaign, maybe a series of 3 minute educational videos in documentary form. We need to fight propaganda with propaganda.
6100 2018-02-11 17:36:45 @TheEddChina hi Edd, just wondering what your thoughts were on vacuum oil extractors, compared to draining from the sump directly, and which one you might recommend?

6106 2018-02-11 17:36:05 Here is what I support: 1. Renewables. Countries like Germany and states like California have had days with 100% electrical from renewables. 2. Natural gas. 3. Existing nuclear, phased out over its lifespan. 4. New nuclear if we follow the French model. Eliminate Coal and oil.
6107 2018-02-11 17:35:52 Sorry sir, is it with palm oil or groundnut oil ?
6108 2018-02-11 17:35:44 I’d go for white truffle oil

6110 2018-02-11 17:35:41 so ? then becomes transmission to real economy.   oil collapse and mkt drop in 16 might be template where transmission to real economy was pretty weak i.e. we weren't close to recession majority of market strats were predicting.
6111 2018-02-11 17:35:16 can’t even ask questions up here w.out gettin sass covered in coconut oil spewed back at you smh

6113 2018-02-11 17:34:42 I found this vitamin e oil and i was looking at the ingredients and there was coconut oil in it  so disappointed
6114 2018-02-11 17:34:32 The entire world was brainwashed into believing #climatechange is real. Fortunately, oil company #lobbyists & Republicans in DC are helping us see through the veil of lies.

6127 2018-02-11 17:33:28 I'm so white I just had three different kinds of cheese on my pasta. 2/3rds of them were different brands of Parmesan. 

The only other things I added were Extra Virgin Olive Oil and "Asian" seasoning.
6128 2018-02-11 17:33:26 Ah, a critique of my writing. I'm ok with that. Judgement call.  Interestingly you just wrote that tar sands oil "sank."  Again. So, we are back to where we started. Tar sands oil sinks. Agreed. It is a very complex process and dependent on many factors. But, given time, it sinks

6133 2018-02-11 17:32:04 You show me how to make ALL oil deravites from hemp at the same cost and I would agree with you. It simply doesn’t exist. Sorry. Wish it did. By opposing pipeline you just show love for Saudi Arabia (women can’t even drive there, no environment protection ) and hate for Alberta.

6135 2018-02-11 17:31:09 Don't let your children wonder around especially in the night. Some parents send their children to the shop at night to buy oil. #PWJK
6136 2018-02-11 17:30:40 You managed to write an entire report talking about Kalamazoo without once talking about oil particle aggregates (OPAs) which are the reason why the oil sank in that case. You literally failed to mention the most important characteristic of the spill

6139 2018-02-11 17:29:56 2/ Recent upwards revision of CL production, when compared to maintained decline in stocks, exhibits "hidden" demand, that consumed the unreported oil production.

6159 2018-02-11 17:27:16 It is important to remember demand for oil maintained positive, post 2014.  This indicates CL- did not infect/reflect economy, but was an insular reaction to isolated crude mkt dynamics, not global economics (aside from not rapidly +ing to consume over prod). 1/

6164 2018-02-11 17:26:46 However, oil rigging and fracking only provides short term, contract employment and the rest is automated. A single pipeline can cause an exuberant amount of costs in oil spills.
6165 2018-02-11 17:26:40 Ahhh...ok I was hoping I missed something. I wonder though if the oil couldn't find someone to trade Lucic to if they sweetened the pot. This  is only a season and a half removed from when he was receiving similar offers from other teams when he signed with the Oil.
6166 2018-02-11 17:26:37 Google Oil spills BC. Think you miss my point. TMX has been debated at length but pipeline is not the issue. No doubt safer than rail! But very little debate about mitigation of marine risk, the real problem. Langley says coastline too long, can’t do it!

6179 2018-02-11 17:25:02 This is because the SDF stopped their advance on the oil. The SAA must be running low on fuel or funds and need the raw resources.

6196 2018-02-11 17:23:55 Well they're actively campainging against the pipeline which was federally approved & would bring in alot of revenue and create jobs and allow oil to reach tide water so Canada can access more export markets.  Tough to fix since the #PM won't step in and take corrective action.
6197 2018-02-11 17:23:28 Charles ! How do you fix stupid ?? I am always amazed how the left tries and tries to stop all oil production in Canada ! What is our economy supposed to thrive on , KALE ???

6210 2018-02-11 17:21:49 Control of ME and it’s oil.
6211 2018-02-11 17:21:44 Thanks!! Oldlums bread mix, sun blushed tomatoes & spinach splash of water & oil ! Unreal !!! @Odlums_Ireland
6212 2018-02-11 17:21:36 What type of cooking oil do you prefer?
6213 2018-02-11 17:21:32 Have you tried bio oil?
6214 2018-02-11 17:21:30 Hot oil burns aren't easy 
6215 2018-02-11 17:20:58 Let’s analyze for a second. Whoever doesn’t eat their sandwich with oil and vinegar is a barbarian. Our ancestors made this wonderful thing called flavor, and you’re just going to shit on it like that?
6216 2018-02-11 17:20:54 You have it quiet the opposite. It is not the suburbs in Kiev that are shelled by the separatists—it is the folk on the east that are shelled by Kiev—it is certainly unfair...  all that death for an oil deal for Biden’s son. It’s awfully cruel for the US to do what it did.
6217 2018-02-11 17:20:47 Let's talk about reducing dependance on oil and gas, period
6218 2018-02-11 17:20:46 #ObamaGate is Obama making payments to form #ISIS. #ISIS took oil from Iraqi lands, in turn funding their jihad and funneling millions back Obama. How is Obama worth $40 million dollars after 8 years on a salary of $400k a year?
6219 2018-02-11 17:20:19 I do support local. I know we need oil. I want to move to better energy BUT the likely damage of spills on my coastline makes me wonder how the existing deal  will help? I don’t have confidence that AB would clean it up.
6220 2018-02-11 17:20:12 @chevrolet who ever come up with the location of the oil filter for a ‘15 Chevy Cruze LT is a special kind of person

6223 2018-02-11 17:19:42 Possibly. Although his uninformed talk regarding Leon stepping back is completely wrong. Simply looking at the stats that’s obvious.

6224 2018-02-11 17:19:37 Who sent them on the futile journey at the first place,  pmb in his desire to discover oil in the north at all cost...  This isn't news the man that sent them has brought them back...
6225 2018-02-11 17:19:29 finna go get this oil change
6226 2018-02-11 17:19:27 Or how about the fact that Eastern Canada uses ‘imported oil’
6227 2018-02-11 17:19:22 Quite shocked how companies can convince us so easily. Suncor made it seem as they were the best and cleanest oil sand extraction company, and they show to reclaim all the disturbed land, but I'm leaning more towards Greenpeace! Still controversial #Greenpeace #Suncor #OilSands
6228 2018-02-11 17:19:15 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
6229 2018-02-11 17:18:57 Fix the family organization tree , they run the front office like a Ma and Pa business ! Seriously anybody go through the scouting positions if you dont believe me...
6230 2018-02-11 17:18:53 I think it's sad that someone has to take refuge from racism. I have no problem with people coming together to heal themselves. Unfortunately we can't exist as oil in water. Segregation needs to end, we can't compartmentalize ourselves because of the colour of our skin.
6231 2018-02-11 17:18:45 Unless Powell ends up buying oil I don’t see the market holding any sustainable rally.
6232 2018-02-11 17:18:42 “The reality of the situation is that any oil spill, be it crude oil or diluted bitumen, represents a tragedy and catastrophe. It will harm the natural environment, will kill some marine organisms, and will be very hard to clean up” so why would we want to incur more risk of this
6233 2018-02-11 17:18:32 Olive oil sehat?
6234 2018-02-11 17:18:28 Oil Coaster
6235 2018-02-11 17:18:10 Wha-? Now why am I not surprised. They need to stay their ashy asses at home then, get familiar with some shea butter and coconut oil, and let the rest of us enjoy this movie.
6236 2018-02-11 17:17:54 This communist regime that we have in Venezuela, already gave the oil to the Russians, Cubans and Chinese. when we always had one of the best industries in the world and these people destroyed it and gave it away.
6237 2018-02-11 17:17:47 Haha chala sarlu poya le ... but aa thindi thinte next day paripovalanipisthadhi .. especially coconut oil tho chesinavi
6238 2018-02-11 17:17:12 I mean, everyone says this, but there were much more effective (and easy) ways to open up more opportunities for oil companies in Iraq, for instance. Instead we blew the whole place to shit and made it insanely expensive for companies to operate there.
6239 2018-02-11 17:17:07 Thank you, is the time to buy oil now?
6240 2018-02-11 17:16:53 Idky my mom thought it was ok to make eggs with oil. My stomach is on angles.

6251 2018-02-11 17:15:32 FAKE NEWS MYJOYONLINE - stomach direction newscasters - 10 people create placards and you capture and broadcast to twist unsuspecting minds - what u shld do is educate ppl that crude oil price rose sharply from 45 to $70 in 6mths period - be objective JOY NEWS
6252 2018-02-11 17:15:31 เช่นกันค่ะ
6253 2018-02-11 17:15:24 Either. I also roast it with a bit of oil and salt and it goes crispy. Great for a snack!
6254 2018-02-11 17:15:20 The world has more oil than it will ever need. It is time for the Oil Companies and Governments to stop trying to make us believe that fossil fuels are some sort of rare commodity. simply so they can increase their profits and revenue. People need to stop believing that lie.

6257 2018-02-11 17:14:58 would ‘harmful chemical’ make it easier to understand my point? Baby products with ‘mineral oil’ (petrol) for example.

6259 2018-02-11 17:14:46 Because they can’t stand fact it’s because of fracking and oil/natgas. They’d prefer windmills, solar and magic pixie dust.
6260 2018-02-11 17:14:41 I haaaaate that!! So I started carrying around a small tube of oil lol. Lotion does nothing for me
6261 2018-02-11 17:14:35 Thank you!!! I cook but i am afraid of hot oil...so, have mercy

6263 2018-02-11 17:14:27 The US is dying into get their hands on Venezuela oil, they have give Venezuela horrible sanctions which isn't nothing new when Us can't get what they want. Meanwhile hows US homeless and poverty situation?
6264 2018-02-11 17:14:09 Bringing Exxon Valdez into this debate shows you don't understand how marine shipment of crude oil has changed over the past 28 years. I have looked up TMX spill incidents...zero for the past three years...Alberta has cut them in half.

6267 2018-02-11 17:13:55 Hello? What the hell! It's an enormous error of concept. Please look the recipi and try it. Only potatoes, egs, olive oil, salt, and depending on flavour: onions. So you are very far from the original. Have you got an internet connection?
6268 2018-02-11 17:13:38 I finally was able to buy a big thing of some cbd oil and it was literally less than a minute before my back pain was almost completely gone... thanking God and also Jesus
6269 2018-02-11 17:13:32 They already are & they are switching from U.S. dollar to other currencies for oil.
THAT is one of the main reasons the West is trying to destabilize Russia which in turn destabilizes China.

6273 2018-02-11 17:13:09 It's all about scoring points against the opponent. Even when it's nonsensical. I mean, telling the ME you come from a backwards country? Utter tripe.

Destroys dirt like no other, even oil on NASCAR uniforms or rags!
6275 2018-02-11 17:12:59 Given it contains palm oil, neither is good for the environment!
6276 2018-02-11 17:12:33 I'm prety sure oil consumption is increasing worldwide. Even with green energy itll keep growing. So the argument that this is a dying industry is just not right. How come USA can have a high tech, banking, manufacturing AND oil&gas sector? Why do we have to pick just one?
6277 2018-02-11 17:12:05 One day I'll be able to make it through  day of work without getting covered in oil and grease...probably
6278 2018-02-11 17:12:05 sure a dictator who wont give up Venezuela oil which US is dying to get their hands on it, must hurt that last year coup didn't work and Venezuela people voted for socialism and kick u lot out!!!
6279 2018-02-11 17:12:03 I worry about this, all it takes is oil prices to go up and this becomes v unsustainable
6280 2018-02-11 17:11:56 Don't be too impressed, we are going back to $30-$40 per barrel of crude Oil...

We may actually be the first country to enter recession Twice in 4 Years...

You're in the wrong place
6283 2018-02-11 17:11:30 Disagree.

Fix the PP and PK and goaltending, and you've gone a long way.

Fix the damn coaching.
6284 2018-02-11 17:11:15 Who is this guy anyway?
6285 2018-02-11 17:11:14 It has been studied extensively, and smoking it is not deadly. Eating it? It's so much stronger eaten, and is appropriate for treating severe pain. Oil is not something I support for recreation, but I do support the oil used to treat seizures, it's miraculous! Use responsibly.
6286 2018-02-11 17:10:54 Being from Wisconsin and disagreeing with Trump?Oil and water.
6287 2018-02-11 17:10:53 Ideally no but that matters little. Fixing this roster has now become a difficult task & everyone outside of 97 has to be in play. And that is all Kypreos really said.

6293 2018-02-11 17:10:22 I heard there was a big increase in the output of oil. The world market is glutted with oil. Fuel is as cheap as dirt just across the border in the United States while Canadian's continue to pay a fortune for gas while being led to believe it's as rare as gold, especially here.
6294 2018-02-11 17:10:21 This reminds me, I need to oil my battle clogs.
6295 2018-02-11 17:10:20 I talked to people who understand GPT. It would be responsible for you do the same. Not oil execs, just anyone who understands how the industry works. Large oil producers of wells pumping lots of oil won’t shut in a well for two years, it makes no financial sense.
6296 2018-02-11 17:10:18 My hair was 99.9% oil, and I had been wearing a shirt from 5 years ago. Lol, Tyra wishes she was me.
6297 2018-02-11 17:10:16 Oh I just slow cooked it. Seasoned with pepper and salt. Rubbed oil in the crackling fat and it turned out like that

6300 2018-02-11 17:10:13 Keep it under 100k miles, be willing to pay triple on any fucking part in existence, change the oil twice as often as other cars you’ll be okay
6301 2018-02-11 17:09:59 This Oil - No matter the billions of barrells of crude oil reserves, as confirmed by Petroleum Explorationists and Geologists will Finish one day. The Oil demon has really captured the soul of our Nation.
6302 2018-02-11 17:09:51 That's bit rich coming from modi supporters just remember this MMS could add  $1 trillion into economy in 7 years which only few countries could do n kept petrol prices within limits despite crude oil selling at $100 per barrel
6303 2018-02-11 17:09:40 Anyone who cares about science doesn't spend their free time defending the oil industry. The oil industry lies about science constantly.
6304 2018-02-11 17:09:31 To cut your risk of heart disease, the AHA claims saturated fats, like coconut oil and butter, should be replaced with polyunsaturated fats, such as vegetable oil and margarine. Do you agree with this recommendation?
6305 2018-02-11 17:09:31 show your talent man...I’m only here to support I’ll buy that baby oil
6306 2018-02-11 17:09:26 If you're sure you didn't leave out the oil or something, try tapioca flour or decrease the amount of flour a little. Wheat flour varies a lot regionally.
6307 2018-02-11 17:09:25 EIA says oil prod has been ~0.8mmbbl/d MORE than reported, since August, yet US stocks STILL declined, in historic amounts, is this not even more bullish than previous supply/demand assumptions that led to CL price increase?   +prod against same -stocks   Think about that.  #OOTT
6308 2018-02-11 17:09:24 It was definitely the worst stop though. The cab driver blamed George bush and the oil he stores there for ruining the island.

6340 2018-02-11 17:04:40 Got myself a new exfoliating body glove for showers.  Great for Endocrine / Circulation and Exfoliating the skin. Feel all tingly after a good scrub. Then it's Beeswax Oil & Lotion. Need to moisturise properly & more regularly. The Sun damages the skin
6341 2018-02-11 17:04:35 Get ALL the foreign oil tankers out of the oceans.Use Canadian Oil! Ban plastic etc on cruise ships. Let's be honest our average boaters are not out on the oceans. Save Billions buy Canadian Oil.
6342 2018-02-11 17:04:25 The smell of oil paint
6343 2018-02-11 17:04:08 I distinctly remember the Labour Prime Minister started the sovereign wealth fund in 1980 with our oil revenues and we avoided wasting them keeping 4 million unemployed for ten years. It now funds the nations social care needs.

6350 2018-02-11 17:01:57 1) Similarly, the inflation in the US in the 1970's was caused by a reduction in oil supplies. Inflation went away once Prudhoe Bay came on tap, and US domestic oil supplies stabilized.

6354 2018-02-11 17:01:41 Are they enough to replace declining oil revenues going forward? Or, (as I think), those "royal" regimes get destabilized either way and another "Arab Spring" comes to the entire region over time.
6355 2018-02-11 17:01:38 Similarly like how you and your husband burnt midnight oil to try and prove relentlessly that modi was the biggest criminal of our country..

6356 2018-02-11 17:01:10 Back in the 1970's under Jimmy Carter we had a Solar Energy Research Institute that was quickly shut down by Reagan and the oil industry.  If we had kept it going, the US could be leading the world in solar...

6374 2018-02-11 16:59:58 Stop replying. You are wasting everyone’s time. Read back up I said fair play for having Oil owners, you are debating with someone who agrees with most of what you are saying but your childish attitude and approach let’s you down.
6375 2018-02-11 16:59:48 I've always wondered,  why is the fuel tax a fixed amount? Costs of asphalt and construction are tied to oil prices. So doesn't it make more sense to make fuel tax a percentage of p/g fuel costs rather rather than a fixed amount p/g?

6379 2018-02-11 16:59:21 This is the great "guess".  Does shale production put an economic cap on the price of oil by off-setting, or exceeding demand?  Production has been higher since August, than EIA wkls indicated.  That has caused the massive up adjustment in current data.  1/
6380 2018-02-11 16:59:15 Common sense advocate, you missed the punch line. hate to break your bubble, but citizens of Venezuela are not fleeing due to dependence only on oil. They had great oil and ag.  Ruined by socialism. Fleeing socialism.
6381 2018-02-11 16:59:14 You say this every time to me about the oil. We wouldn’t be anywhere without the money we would have probably been relegated by now without it every club in the whole world needs money these days to get somewhere in football and every united fan just hates it that we are better
6382 2018-02-11 16:59:04 Dear Occupant of the White House,

Why have gas prices skyrocketed recently when we have plenty of oil coming in? Why are the cost of groceries rising? Why is my 401k tanking? That extra $1.50 a month isn't going to cover this. 

You take credit for everything so this is on you.
6383 2018-02-11 16:58:42 I have been! I worked in the oil industry I texas for 10 years and was pushed out for a white man with no experience. What did I do?

6384 2018-02-11 16:58:36 I just had my Jeep checked out and oil changed on Friday and my check engine light is on now...I’m not happy.
6385 2018-02-11 16:58:24 Proximity to a good site for EOR vs storage, and the cost of piping it to either, may be a bigger factor. Market price of CO2 is low, so I'm not sure choice will be sensitive to price of oil.

6403 2018-02-11 16:56:31 Upon passage, your income tax, utility bills, and gasoline will go up, bill taxing those who can least afford it so that oil & gas taxes can stay low.

6416 2018-02-11 16:54:22 I don't think the orange turd has any concept of morals, normalcy, or humility. He may be more worried about the money laundering, exchange of removing sanctions for presidency/him personally profiting off removing sanctions on oil reserves, and general treason.
6417 2018-02-11 16:54:21 Wow are you misguided. Hey I have some oil bearing property for you to buy. It will certainly make you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
6418 2018-02-11 16:54:16 You can prepare a ton of them and eat throughout the week. The trick is to steam the zucchinis beforehand. And sweat the shallots and bell peppers so everything had the same degree of crunchiness.

6431 2018-02-11 16:52:57 Be careful though, coconut oil can clog up pores and cause break outs if used too much!! Also exfoliating works magic
6432 2018-02-11 16:52:18 That’s good to know. I’ll just get a small one for my twist outs then and stick to their coconut oil gel for everything else.

OIL！
6475 2018-02-11 16:43:36 Coconut oil to remove makeup, some sort bar face soap, micellar water/toner, shea butter. That is all.
6476 2018-02-11 16:43:22 Yes, I don't deep fry stuff at home. Scared of the hot oil. :P
6477 2018-02-11 16:43:19 How do people oil pull for longer than 5 minutes? I’ll get like 30 seconds in and I wanna throw up
6478 2018-02-11 16:43:18 Best advice I could give someone in high school right now? Ditch university, work on an oil rig for 4 years instead. You'll come home with enough money to buy a house instead of graduating with mountains of debt
6479 2018-02-11 16:43:16 Have PBS fund us with some baby oil n we got you 
6480 2018-02-11 16:43:12 Yes.  Multiple stimulants to inflation.  Key driver is debt, due to low int rts.  + rates will pinch, if no full employment and broad wage inflation.  -Oil mitigates +inflation, but cannot remain low if demand is high.  Dropping oil does not provide - contagion to broader mkts.
6481 2018-02-11 16:43:10 Have you ever tried full spectrum CBD oil? 100% THC free.
6482 2018-02-11 16:42:53 Sure, for fiscal year 2016. Let's include the last 50 years of oil/coal/gal subsidization that gave a tremendous boost and advantage to the industry. This is apples to oranges, due to solar being much younger to market.

big oil ignoring first nations and government is unconstitutional
6484 2018-02-11 16:42:48 Back to the original debate, there are a lot of things City can say and do with their new found oil money. Mock other teams history is definitely not one of them. 
6485 2018-02-11 16:42:46 Yes and there is a such thing as too much oil. Ppl over saturate and drown they hair in oil
6486 2018-02-11 16:42:41 ストーリー一周して終わった
6487 2018-02-11 16:42:29 Origin might be Gowon's outlook when oil prices boomed. Altho it's not a utility, Ng Airways from then till the early IBB years provided below cost services for Ngns. Mostly, it wasn't run as a business. And in some ways, we still are on an ego trip, sadly
6488 2018-02-11 16:42:23 It’s simple your #climatechange #hoax is based on fantasy and is putting Canada last. You don’t want to sell Saudi trucks but happily buy their oil funding abuse of women. #wakeup
6489 2018-02-11 16:42:18 Whats your oil position. Long or short?
6490 2018-02-11 16:42:16 地球防衛軍買ってる人周りにほとんどいないんだよなぁ…
6491 2018-02-11 16:41:36 Back when real men were covered in gushing oil and didn't complain
6492 2018-02-11 16:41:34 Depends, how much oil do they have?
6493 2018-02-11 16:41:34 Aku beli contact lens solution, bio oil nak hilangkan parut tadi. Yang sales tu makeups je kot sebab mascara etc ada ah sampai half price so aku beli jugak lah 
6494 2018-02-11 16:41:25 3x oil etns
6495 2018-02-11 16:41:15 oh I'm talking essential oil sorry should have said that!
6496 2018-02-11 16:41:09 I suppose its city's oil money you lost today you dick @markgoldbridge
6497 2018-02-11 16:40:39 Ok. @ScottPruittOK rolled back regs for clean air & water & doesn’t believe in climate science & we see uptick in pollution in WV rivers. #Zinke giving away land to big oil & mining #MonumentsForAll @fema botched #PuertoRico recovery. Not #MSM points. Mine. Just tiny sample.

6501 2018-02-11 16:40:03 Between seeing friends sell off all they have and then using their page to act as their virtual store to sell snake oil from a pyramid scheme, agreed it does get OLD lol
6502 2018-02-11 16:40:00 Yeah. It’s not a pure displacement: the CO2 flows more easily into tiny cracks and pockets in the rock, so it allows more of the gas/oil to be extracted. But yes, the CO2 then stays down there. Amount of CO2 injected can be 2x the C in the fuel extracted, so it sequesters carbon.
6503 2018-02-11 16:39:51 Hot oil treatments feel so good to my scalp 
6504 2018-02-11 16:39:40 Czy zna ktoś jakiś produkt który reducałkowicie wybawia?¿ czerwone plamy po trądziku? Używam bio oil i schodzą te które są prawie nie widoczne a te strasznie czerwone są tylko Troszke bledsze ale po kilku godzinach prześwitują one nawet przez podkład 
#tweetmekurwa
6505 2018-02-11 16:39:37 I agree, the Harper Gov did little to advance AB products to market. Canada still imports Saudi Oil FFS
6506 2018-02-11 16:39:33 I hope #OKLeg Democrats do not agree to tax away Oklahoma's clean and renewable energy future to help keep Oklahoma's oil and gas gross production tax at the lowest rate in the country.
6507 2018-02-11 16:39:29 You can toss as many random graphs as you like... Federal GDP, gas and oil graphs.... this is a conversation about provincial politics&  the #Wynne govt wasting money. I think you are a tad confused on the subject. Nice graphs though!   ...& you say I shld be embarrassed

6509 2018-02-11 16:38:24 Majority of the American people are fedup with the great disservice of the lame MSM propaganda machine. they're a machine with no oil, so that makes them junk, make sense? The Enemy Of The American People, the disservice is tremendous, the great Constitutional Disservice,Corrupt!
6510 2018-02-11 16:38:20 I might trade some oil this week
6511 2018-02-11 16:38:13 Yeah, the other classic is at least we made our money rather than oil money, sure mate you keep thinking that
6512 2018-02-11 16:38:12 Fans MU tngah sibuk update pasal oil money, buy league & AJL. Hahahahaha
6513 2018-02-11 16:38:11 Just like the Eastern provinces prefer corrupt oil monopolies product. They pay a higher price, gets shipped by tankers but that’s okay, as long as it isn’t AB, it’s better. What happened to support local?
6514 2018-02-11 16:38:11 We can buy that coconut oil on food stamps lmao I’m going get Leia some
6515 2018-02-11 16:38:02 The kitchen nearly burned down, I got burned with boiling hot oil, and my mum's asking about her pan

6519 2018-02-11 16:37:24 Why is coconut oil so expensive 
6520 2018-02-11 16:36:51 "Oh this this just some olive oil I put in my hair as a conditioner. I waaas going to wash it before I came here but I didn't"

6524 2018-02-11 16:35:47 I don't want a bunch of lithium or battery acid in my living room either. I want research done on all possible sources of energy. I'm not out here pushing lithium batteries as the answer. I want open, honest research on the subject without smear campaigns funded by big oil.
6525 2018-02-11 16:35:39 Yes but if oil stays flat inflation will fade a bit as its effects roll off. Rental vacancies are starting to creep up too & may put pressure on a big chunk of CPI. I think rent growth just peaked at 3%.
6526 2018-02-11 16:35:19 Not with my skin but you can use any other oil tbh and even honey and you can wash off the oil with face soap

6531 2018-02-11 16:34:32 It’ll let us sign Sanchez even with competition like City, it’ll help us EARN money compared to your oil money, it’ll help us stay in contention for title at all times. Just give it time, have your fun and celebration this season, have your banter, I’ll take it. But give it time.

6542 2018-02-11 16:32:48 Colorado Oil and Gas industry is unethical & DANGEROUS not the model of safety as deceitful proclaimed by it's mouthpiece @CREDorg. People killed in explosions homes destroyed students forced out of school.

6549 2018-02-11 16:32:09 Had a deluded yoon, Catholic of Irish descent, yesterday tell me that Scotland has never really been a country anyway and there's no oil left we are too poor.
6550 2018-02-11 16:32:00 Did you know black seed oil cures cancer?not just cancer 
But it also cures tumours in 15 days
6551 2018-02-11 16:32:00 Surely you would concede that cost, at least in relation to solar (of wind cost, I’m much less informed), the cost has fallen considerably? Also, you’d surely admit that billions upon billions of dollars spent subsidizing coal/gas/oil kept it’s price artificially low?
6552 2018-02-11 16:31:58 @RachelNotley B.C. and Alberta’s war isn’t about oil or the environment, it’s about getting reelected
6553 2018-02-11 16:31:57 Cooking the good food, peeling the potatoes, baking the meat, pouring the oil
6554 2018-02-11 16:31:53 The story of the bridegroom bothers me. The five "wise" women are praised for selfishly hoarding the oil for their lamps. We don't know why the other women didn't have extra oil. Maybe they brought all they had, and it wasn't enough.
6555 2018-02-11 16:31:48 Witch hazel and coconut oil

6558 2018-02-11 16:31:33 OH at breakfast: I'm selling CBD oil. It is great for fibromyalgia, ADHD, arthritis, autism. It is just wonderful. 

(Me: No one needs allopathic medicine anymore!)
6559 2018-02-11 16:31:28 Tell me about those carbon free #2 oil fired aux boilers, emergency diesel generators, outage support vehicles and 1000’s of employees driving carbon emitting vehicles to get to these nuke plants. Tell me about all the conferences nuke employees fly/drive to ATL and abroad
6560 2018-02-11 16:31:20 Wie sieht's aus mit Peak Oil, ja/nein?
6561 2018-02-11 16:31:17 Now image the oil rigs silhouetted against the sunrise. Gotta love this administrations willingness to strip everything down to profits for big oil and coal.
6562 2018-02-11 16:30:51 This is pretty interesting actually- we had been considering CBD oil for sleep as well. DC is a medical/recreational marijuana friendly place, so shouldn’t be hard to get. Interesting that it helped you with light sensitivity and brain fog! What dosage did you start out with?

6575 2018-02-11 16:29:18 "You" americans save a lot of money buying gas, oil, etc. With unequal deals, and boosting multiple wars around the world, to move your obsolete military inventory.... And secure your insatiable hungry of drugs
6576 2018-02-11 16:29:09 Also... How do u manage to look so cute 4 days not washing your hair. I looknlike I was dunk in an oil tub next day after wasghin my hair... So jelly!!
6577 2018-02-11 16:29:08 If referring to EOR vs Storage, it will probably entirely depend on oil price; ADM CCS project originally was just gonna be for nearby EOR. Price of oil tanked and it instead became the only active commercial storage facility in the country (maybe world?).
6578 2018-02-11 16:29:03 lmao excuse me.....what scent oil you got on? hahah
6579 2018-02-11 16:28:58 How easy for Communist Hostile Foreign Governments to simply use their checkbooks and oil wealth to purchase the American GOP, NRA, FOX Media, Sinclair Broadcasting with the assistance of Kochs, Mercers, Adelson .
Nothing but a global criminal enterprise @JoeNBC @mikebarnicle
6580 2018-02-11 16:28:53 Thanks  for your advice they only need more oil when massage 
6581 2018-02-11 16:28:52 Ofcourse trump imposed 30% on solar panels he wants oil and gas BC he made a deal with oil comp. 
And he has shares.

6595 2018-02-11 16:27:07 Yes. Most people don’t understand the impact of energy on the rest of the economy, but it’s $200B in annual Capex that went from rapid acceleration to deceleration back to acceleration. You can map ISM pretty well with lagged oil price & rig/duc count.

6599 2018-02-11 16:26:23 It was janky. But i liked it. I kept thinking it needed coconut oil bc it looked dry.
6600 2018-02-11 16:26:19 Um, @seanro3, are you kidding doing me? Racial tensions have skyrocketed. Trump defended Charlottesville Nazis, rescinded DACA, killing EPA, supports coal mining and oil drilling, defends sex offenders(himself being one). I can go on...
6601 2018-02-11 16:26:08 Have you tasted motor oil before to ascertain that it doesn’t taste like chocolate sauce?
6602 2018-02-11 16:26:05 I would never allow my oil sis to date a guy with sphamandla hairstyle   #DateMyFamily

6605 2018-02-11 16:25:37 Trump and his cronies are the very embodiment of evil! They are in bed with big Pharma, big oil, big farming, big coal just name every problem we’re facing as a country and planet and you’ll see they do their bidding... and Russia!
6606 2018-02-11 16:25:37 ไม่อยากคิดไรละ
6607 2018-02-11 16:25:35 Where 100% of their economy is from the sale of oil.
6608 2018-02-11 16:25:30 Mix coconut oil in it
6609 2018-02-11 16:25:24 Wow. Maybe it’s just a lie that coconut oil is supposed to work
6610 2018-02-11 16:25:21 Rob, anyone who voted for tRump and house & Senate Republicans voted for it. Oil and Gas execs own the Republicans in the House, Senate and WH  and are enabled by those who vote R.E voters own this. They helped break solar. Up to R’s to stop whining & stop voting R

6612 2018-02-11 16:25:06 And for the record, don't drink oil or funnel car exhaust into a closed environment, especially if you or your pets are in it.
6613 2018-02-11 16:24:49 don't knock it if you haven't been on the farm
6614 2018-02-11 16:24:41 But its oil n gas 
6615 2018-02-11 16:24:31 I've used similar products to what you mentioned here and I got great results when I switched to using coconut oil - it's got super anti-frizz properties. If it's solid, just grab a chunk about the size of a mentos and rub it between your hands til it liquifies.
6616 2018-02-11 16:24:22 CBD oil helps me with some of my anxiety but I have her silexan (lavender) can help as well. Intrustive thoughts suck especially with sleep disorders 
6617 2018-02-11 16:24:14 Weren’t there reports last month of oil contractors from South Pars going on strike because they hadn’t been paid in several months?
6618 2018-02-11 16:24:07 ไม่เคยเป็นคนสำคํญ
6619 2018-02-11 16:23:58 Maybe every industrialized nation should stop importing oil from Nigeria? There would be no oil revenue for parlimentarians to fight and kill over and people would begin developing their own local economy using their own natural resources.  @OkonkwoLeo
6620 2018-02-11 16:23:54 Then park your car, don’t fly, turn off your lights, turn off the heat, don’t buy bottled anything. Hey just go live in the bush. And put your phone and computer down too. All results of oil and gas production

6631 2018-02-11 16:22:43 I love the smell of the tree oil in the morning 
6632 2018-02-11 16:22:32 i def hate tea tree oil tho but tiis ganda, hayup
6633 2018-02-11 16:22:31 Except the sea is filled with CO2, dead fish, oil, and plastic. May want to stay inside.
6634 2018-02-11 16:22:19 Not a fan of the smell of tea tree oil but here I am slathering it on my piercings!
6635 2018-02-11 16:22:16 City fans piping up. Yeah you’ve been good this season. Are you forgetting it’s oil money that’s got you there. Forever in our shadow
6636 2018-02-11 16:21:59 @narendramodi Address 2 Indian Diaspora was gr8. Savings of 1.40 lac crores in Oil, LED etc.+Mines+Spectrum+Govt cos Profits=12 lac cr gain
6637 2018-02-11 16:21:47 The Olive Oil in the Woodlands has belly dancers and good food.
6638 2018-02-11 16:21:46 LOL call themselves ISIS Hunter but there is a Huge ISIS pocket in the desert who no one dare to attack ? Oh right oil field are way more better huh ? Their attacks were spotted by pro SAA way before it was launched and they even posted about their goals ( oil field )
6639 2018-02-11 16:21:31 Kenyans should be worried about oil exploration in Turkan,if war strikes it is gone
6640 2018-02-11 16:21:27 Anyone know where I can get vegan tea lights from that don’t contain palm oil and don’t cost the earth? #vegan #help #tealights

6642 2018-02-11 16:21:17 At the rate Ms McKenna is shilling for Texas oil corporations, liberals might be completely shut out of BC next election.

Corporations over our environment.    And she's the so-called climate change Minister.    What a joke.
6643 2018-02-11 16:21:17 No the spill was a result of drilling from oil. I don't want an oil drill near my house.
6644 2018-02-11 16:21:14 Let us not forget that from 8000 in 2009, sensex was almost 16000 in 2014 with a PE of 18 I think. This happened in the midst of global eco crisis, high oil prices etc.
6645 2018-02-11 16:21:04 but it’s OIL, . . . grrrr
6646 2018-02-11 16:21:01 According to BCGov's own spill history page, the only significant spills since the late '70's have been from trains, trucks and barges. A minority of BC'rs are willing to screw their neighbour over weak fears and short term self-satisfaction. Don't want oil - park all your cars.
6647 2018-02-11 16:20:57 Can u ask what she meant when she said oil workers were rapists?
6648 2018-02-11 16:20:38 BC is right. It’s never been up to Trudeau to pass the oil pipeline into an area to jeopardize thepopular support of the people of B.C.!!
6649 2018-02-11 16:20:00 All pipelines eventually fail. That's simple science. When they do, oil companies don't have sinking fund to pay...taxpayers pay and. shareholders laugh when they receive dividend from ill-gotten profit. BC coast uses tankers, not pipelines. 
You confuse your opinion with fact.
6650 2018-02-11 16:19:48 تلقاه مكتوب بالإنجليزي hydrogenated oil، اذا لقيت هالجملة الزيت مهدرج، ولو لقيت الجملة وقبلها كلمة Non مثلاً Non-Hydrogenated Oil يعني غير مهدرج
6651 2018-02-11 16:19:39 Exactly. Idk what the huge wave of coconut oil usage was a few years ago.

6656 2018-02-11 16:19:04 Congrats @ClayMillican on your historic run. We had fun on #PinksAllOut.
6657 2018-02-11 16:18:56 This is already the busiest train and road route in the country. Ahmedabad, Surat, Vapi and Baroda are bigger than any possible combination. Diamond, jewelry, garments, oil, plastics, cash crops etc. And the most efficient.
6658 2018-02-11 16:18:33 Nobody is coming to violate your laws. Is the people in power like Mr little Marco and the  U.S. government that want to come an violate the laws and self determination of a sobering country with the excuse of freedom and democracy when in reality they want their oil
6659 2018-02-11 16:18:31 Water is the breath of life>Tories are the oil that suffocate it
6660 2018-02-11 16:18:22 In Iran, women can not only drive but they can vote. Iran is also home to largest Jewish population (100,000) in the ME outside of Israel. Jews aren’t even allowed to travel to KSA. I’m not an expert here but some things just don’t make sense unless it’s about OIL
6661 2018-02-11 16:18:05 The oil companies in America that would benefit from the oil kingdoms of Saudi Arabia and Qatar having permission from the Syrian government to construct their proposed pipeline thru syria......but to do this they need permission that Assad refuses to give(good for him).
6662 2018-02-11 16:18:04 If you drink castor oil to khipha inyongo,I salute you.

What is to khipha inyongo in English anyway? I keep saying khipha inyongo because I don't know 
6663 2018-02-11 16:17:58 “Tillerson initially met Putin in 1999 on the Sakhalin island in Russia's Far East, when Exxon struck a deal with Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.“

6664 2018-02-11 16:17:56 @RuaMufc you do crack me up, every time a small team beats you’s, u complain about that team for being shite every week and only upping their game against Utd. Just admit you’s are useless every other week, Newcastle could of been 2/3 up in the first 20 mins. Take yer oil kid 
6665 2018-02-11 16:17:53 There are renewable sources for all those things that the transition to is already underway for. If you want to know more, then start reading or supporting green choices in your own house. Point is, oil expansion makes less and less sense.
6666 2018-02-11 16:17:41 Attributing the screwup post 2009 to oil price is also similar. Credit UPA1 for growth but dont give blame for economic screwup post 2009.
6667 2018-02-11 16:17:15 The 9 Year Flood of Free Money from Central Banks around the world to keep Corporations afloat has inflated the Price of Time to astronomical, perhaps prohibitive levels.  The Market & Oil are now falling together again...(history repeats itself...people never change...)
6668 2018-02-11 16:17:00 I've been using almond oil on my face at night... I feel so moisturized omg
6669 2018-02-11 16:16:57 Because I want to see you struggle not to. *laughs and still not removing the torture device from the other's neck, grabs a lead sprinkler, filled with boiling oil. Drips the contents onto Amelia's eyes, doing this to test the woman's resistance. Will the pain cause her to drop +
6670 2018-02-11 16:16:54 but a friend is also gonna give me some oil soon hopefully so i can make my own edibles too!! thank you so much for the advice i appreciate it lots n lots 
6671 2018-02-11 16:16:47 The mask does exfoliate, but otherwise, no I don't. I have crazy combination skin. Dry and itchy in some areas, oily in others. And if I use too much oil in my product, I break out. Any chemicals or harsh ingredients, I have a rash. So it's an odd balancing act.
6672 2018-02-11 16:16:45 Thank u sir 4 replying, I hope Saudi allows religious freedom, as of now it's not allowed. They're moving twds reformatory islam coz they know their oil resources will finish up in future. But I think d centre of Wahhabism may shift to India coz D-u. Deoband's a major problem.

6680 2018-02-11 16:15:52 Short-term fluctuations in oil price aren’t important; “What’s important for us is the overall direction” of prices, and producers’ level of compliance with global production cuts

6681 2018-02-11 16:15:50 I was thinking that peel! Absolutely over fried in a frying pan with lots of oil  X
6682 2018-02-11 16:15:47 Stir together 2 quarts cheddar with 2 cups carne asada. Add Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve a la mode
6683 2018-02-11 16:15:40 That would be propaganda like "dont build your economic case on oil because its a volitile commodity and might well fall considerably in price". That sort of propaganda? The accurate sort?
6684 2018-02-11 16:15:39 This man bring me my car back with a receipt that say $38  BOY take this shit back to the shop and exchange this oil change for the $20 
6685 2018-02-11 16:15:37 i wonder what views they have concerning how their oil wealth is spent by the mainland
6686 2018-02-11 16:15:04 Sadly, we won't Mr commonsense senator. The price of oil has gone up, so that ain't gonna happen.
If we must change leadership, you and many of your kind should be exterminated.
6687 2018-02-10 23:59:39 @realDonaldTrump Since you always play fair & never cheated any contractors out of their Fair Wages, how about you pay for your Russian-style parade in D.C. with the funds from your percentage of the $500 billion Rosneft Oil Co deal your Exxon mobster pal Rex has w Putin?

6694 2018-02-10 23:58:01 Every night we start getting ready for dinner, we put the oil in the pan, and turn on the gass, and we suddenly hear this blairing loud noise. We run around like maniacs swinging the towel to take out the agony in our ears. I fricken hate this fire alarm

6697 2018-02-10 23:57:07 They kinda are. Norway had oil. Norway used the oil for the benefit of all. Fuck the far left. Fuck tankies. I'll take Norway tomorrow.
6698 2018-02-10 23:56:44 We're addicted to oil in the same way plants are addicted to CO2: So far it's necessary.
6699 2018-02-10 23:56:41 Saudi is desperately trying to reform as oil will have its Kodak moment in the next 12 years. The Sheikhs have plundered the country and taken trillions offshore. Citizens benefits have been taken away which were used to bribe them. This measure won’t work in saving Saudi.
6700 2018-02-10 23:56:27 Got my first oil change with my car & it was $40 less than I was expecting. I'm not exaggerating when I say I feel like I won the lottery.

6728 2018-02-10 23:53:19 1/2 LPG replaced w trad. biofuels is indeed small to affect global emissions. Yet according to one of the models in Nature it matters for India's poor. However, some models consistently show baseline replacement of oil and gas by coal in Middle East, Russia, India, Africa and NA.
6729 2018-02-10 23:53:06 @CBCTheHouse @AJWVictoriaBC said that he'd be okay with refined oil going through the pipeline so why not get @JJHorgan to create more jobs in BC by building a refinery right at the border with Alberta. That should make @RachelNotley happy, too. Everyone can win!

6741 2018-02-10 23:50:10 I believe the Dems are afraid of losing our Republic, at long last.  This always happens eventually in democratic societies.  Donald Trump the Snake Oil Salesman is clearly the downfall we’ve dreaded.

6746 2018-02-10 23:49:26 I know don't want a war but they are not going to stop unless you stop IRAN. Why hit the little van in Syria when you can hit the oil refinery in Bandar Abass? Iran thinks Israel won't hurt them, change the rules. When they know a single incident will see their oil exports end.

6761 2018-02-10 23:47:15 Try Banila Co. dorang ada different types of cleansing oil for different type of skin. Untuk cerahkan kulit, I don't know.Sorry 
6762 2018-02-10 23:47:04 Case in point: the national parks system. Without the govt, private enterprise would either strip mine them for resources, drill for oil, or charge exorbitant fees for entry. With govt, these lands are preserved and the public has a chance to enjoy them.
6763 2018-02-10 23:47:03 Really glad I got to do this Epsom salt, olive oil, castor oil soak.

6765 2018-02-10 23:46:56 this is the first day i’ve gone without being in any severe pain thanks to that herbal oil 
6766 2018-02-10 23:46:45 You and Harper have shipped tens of thousands of high paying pipeline construction & oil/gas E&P jobs to US along with our future. So stay
6767 2018-02-10 23:46:44 I prefer to put a little coconut oil in with my Kraft dinner so that when I dump it into the garbage it slides out better. 

Now if we are talking fresh pasta with Alfredo sauce as a side to a nice steak… I’m in!
6768 2018-02-10 23:46:39 Kahapon, I started using Tea tree oil on my pimple break out.
6769 2018-02-10 23:46:36 It costs more bottled than oil
6770 2018-02-10 23:46:34 See also the 2009-2013 AWD Ford Flex. Transfer case is a sealed unit with “lifetime” oil. Mechanics have resorted to drilling out and installing their own oil fill/drain ports to keep them running past 100K miles or so.
6771 2018-02-10 23:46:24 Me too.The Rupublican party has changed from fiscal conservatives,believers of independent responsibility,less government to this fiasco of increasing the deficit, over control of personal beliefs, and interference with States rights like marijuana and off coast oil drilling. Boo
6772 2018-02-10 23:46:22 Media Party crickets last two days:
1) Trudeau's top advisor calls people "Nazis"
2) Trudeau's enviro minister says oil workers are rapists
3) Trudeau and his justice minister stir up racism after court verdict
6773 2018-02-10 23:46:12 เห็นน้องใส่ตลอดนะ แต่ไม่ค่อยโชว์ชอบซ่อนในแขนเสื้อ ต้องส่องทุกรูป5555
6774 2018-02-10 23:46:05 His advisor calls critics Nazis, he suggests all Canadians islamiphobes, environment minister suggests oil workers are rapists and now justice minister suggests jurors are racist.  And all those who wanted Harper out probably think this is a competent crew.
6775 2018-02-10 23:45:56 thanks for reaching out as we take customer feedback seriously. Could you please DM us with details on your oil change?
6776 2018-02-10 23:45:46 Stir together 1 pound Rice with 1/3 cup Graham crackers. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with love.

6779 2018-02-10 23:45:10 Well that is a different story. Your post said nothing about it being tainted or poisoned.  That is an issue ACTUAL CBD oil is useful in treating chronic pain, epilepsy, and PTSD.
6780 2018-02-10 23:44:40 Oil tankers pose a much lower risk as they are required to travel at lower speeds and will be accompanied by safety tugs to the 12 mile marker so what precisely are you referring to?
6781 2018-02-10 23:44:27 Yeah, except that the products of the oil and gas industry - while necessary to some degree - end up poisoning the world. So let's support a balanced approach to their existence - not poorly thought out expansion.
6782 2018-02-10 23:44:17 Hey this is the simon we have watch every night on lucas oil tv we are cheering on Kyle Bronson  we are from Westphalia mo.

6790 2018-02-10 23:42:48 you did say she's was a naughty girl before. it was going to happen sooner oil later
6791 2018-02-10 23:42:39 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
6792 2018-02-10 23:42:36 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

6796 2018-02-10 23:42:06 "hair gel"?? I doubt they used, or even HAD gel back then. More likely an oil or grease.
6797 2018-02-10 23:42:03 Trump has no scruples. He contradicts himself 24/7   Just look at his tweet history. He is a fuckin hypocrite snake oil salesmen. #NotMyPresident
6798 2018-02-10 23:41:59 Jobs can be created by investing in more green energy programs and away from unsustainable dying industries such as fossil fuels & coal. But our govt, very much Reps & the trump administration included, are knee deep in oil money and other billionaire corporate money. So nahhhh
6799 2018-02-10 23:41:57 Drilling off our shores is a terrible idea! Bad for the environment, bad for tourism, only value is to oil companies!

6823 2018-02-10 23:38:09 No oil and drilling off the California coast
6824 2018-02-10 23:38:01 Nothing like a little divisive fear to condition the unconscious  citizens.
You can be good stewards of both the economy + the environment.
Canada has the best track record in the world for oil extraction - yet Liberals still need to shame you into compliance.

6843 2018-02-10 23:33:17 I used to get this . You have to avoid creams that have oil in them as it blocks your skin and causes irritation. I found using Clarins cream base sun tan lotion is brilliant .  Also try sudo cream if you can get some as that will calm the irritation x
6844 2018-02-10 23:33:08 This front bench dim bulb now calls male oilworkers rapists as part of her ploy to destroy our oil
6845 2018-02-10 23:33:06 The real solution is to abandon the pipeline in favour of a planned new dedicated railway moving oil from Fort Macmurray to Alaska and out via Valdez. It would also open up northern BC and southern Yukon for mineral and other development.
6846 2018-02-10 23:33:00 He needs someone to help with that oil im sure
6847 2018-02-10 23:32:31 Like "Clean Coal" there is ZERO safe deepwater drilling.  Only fools believe otherwise.  How do you feel about the Sound Guns used to search for oil?  They blow out the hearing of whales, dolphins and other life in the ocean, would @God want that?  NO

He's against Green Energy & supports fucking the environment.

6909 2018-02-10 23:22:29 Recipe for #Afrin Kebab.... 5 parts scorched Turkey meat.. 1 part olive oil
6910 2018-02-10 23:22:28 Got an oil change, went grocery shopping, done cooking, cleaning for the moment...I swear I do a lot more when I’m off than when I’m at work lol 
6911 2018-02-10 23:22:25 The politics in Kenya has become a cess pool of mediocrity and plain simple undermining of the constitution, rules and laws governing and also has belittled the stature of presidency. Which in my own opinion has brought up the era oil of events unfooling
6912 2018-02-10 23:22:09 I put eucalyptus and lemongrass into my oil diffuser so my room smells fresh and clean I'm finally sorting through all my clothes. It's a struggle but being productive does wonders for my depression. 
6913 2018-02-10 23:21:53 in every case you mention the truth was known and it served interests to play the game and allow people to be massacred. That is the imperialist narrative, the beneficiaries of slaughter are always those who extract the value from the situation. Who is draining the oil reserves?
6914 2018-02-10 23:21:51 If you eat too much, your ass will weigh a ton - hence, ass-ton.  And yes, coconut oil also falls in the highly saturated fat camp. Boooooo
6915 2018-02-10 23:21:40 Well most ME countries are too reliant on oil so that economic power can disappear in seconds. Africa has been spinning it's wheels in the mud for a long time.  Little change in sight. Asia will not be long term viable unless they can reverse their population issue. 1 of 2
6916 2018-02-10 23:21:36 Just ordered my Forever Flawless Beauty Oil from @FarahPink. I cant wait to try 
6917 2018-02-10 23:21:35 I wish there was a mutual fund that didn't invest in asshole companies. A lot of the funds that avoid carbon emissions and oil are often invested in nasty banks.
6918 2018-02-10 23:21:33 Did k Brule just said chevron Alakija ke.... It's famfa oil ooo#BBNaija
6919 2018-02-10 23:21:02 This kid said he can't wait to work on his truck but he doesn't know how to do an oil change lol bye
6920 2018-02-10 23:20:55 I out the butter in thebtea while it is brewing and it melts and then add more coconut oil and some stevia to sweeten it 
6921 2018-02-10 23:20:47 depends on the concentration. HEMP OIL must be less than 5% thc. Many home brews are not HEMP and have MUCH higher %'s of psychoactives.
6922 2018-02-10 23:20:29 !Nos usan y nos usarán hasta que el oil les sirva para las factory de car electric a nivel mundial!Pujante emprendimiento chino!Car hibrido!
6923 2018-02-10 23:20:09 that's a lot of oil on that man 
6924 2018-02-10 23:20:05 Little do you know the oil business. To be truthful many are doing the job of 2.5 people after all the cost cutting layoffs. Stupid in a way because it puts safety, the environment and due diligence at risk in the head offices. They cut in the wrong places to stay afloat.
6925 2018-02-10 23:19:55 This war machine is huge, try to stop big oil & bank, it's obviously a death sentence
6926 2018-02-10 23:19:43 Shower, Palmer’s lotion, and coconut oil got me feeling edible
6927 2018-02-10 23:19:42 What about the $32 billion a year we pay for foreign oil ?

6929 2018-02-10 23:19:26 Moses loves coconut oil its so weird.
6930 2018-02-10 23:19:15 Have you tried Tea Tree essential oil?  It's a great NATURAL antiseptic that can also dull pain. I like either NOW or Aura Casia brand, which are pretty easy to find.  While you're there, see if you can find Eucalyptus EO - great for congestion. Dilute with EVOO. Works like Vicks
6931 2018-02-10 23:19:13 Looks at the oil.

6934 2018-02-10 23:18:58 US interpretation of "the right to defend oneself". 
- Fighting for Koniko oil field is the right to defend oneself. 
- Israel has the right to defend oneself. 
- But what about Turkey ?
6935 2018-02-10 23:18:41 "Two brave members of armed forces martyred" - dying absurdly in a helicopter accident while in invasion mission to kill indiscriminately in another country has nothing to do with the word "martyr". Poor unfortunate soldiers following orders serving just obscure oil interests.

6937 2018-02-10 23:18:24 Me: I should save money
Also me: oh let's buy crystals and order thc oil.

6938 2018-02-10 23:18:24  but I like both coconut and tasty, thick yogurt! And fat, I suppose. I’m in the pro-good fats camp (but hadn’t ever looked at info on the type in coconut. Does this mean coconut oil is bad, too?)
6939 2018-02-10 23:18:18 Argan Oil is a whole blessing 
6940 2018-02-10 23:18:11 Confirmed. Cars is set in the distant future after all humans have been eliminated. If they only drink oil, WHY DO THEY HAVE TEETH???
6941 2018-02-10 23:18:07 The “business coalition” is using the oil & gas playbook: stick the bill on the working class. 
Do you see any corporate tax increases, increase on capital gains, increases on income tax for the highest earners, etc.? 
Only the richest among us had a seat at the bargaining table.
6942 2018-02-10 23:17:54 Suffered with it for years! Until I discovered clarins dry oil sun spray you use it instead of sun cream and has all the protection in too good luck x
6943 2018-02-10 23:17:52 Rail station forecourt project had approx double the area of the Cornhill and was done for £1m (okay it looks pretty awful, surface covering wearing away, oil stains and so forth... but that isn't the point lol)
6944 2018-02-10 23:17:48 Um you can import oil, check @honkyconky timeline for a link to something. Dunno if you can put on gums but it’s fine here as none of the trippy elements in it.

6949 2018-02-10 23:16:56 Your pantry wants you to oil up and be in a Gladiator movie?
6950 2018-02-10 23:16:55 What a game between the Oil Kings and Red Deer Rebels. Back and fourth. Edmonton scores the winner on the PP with 7 seconds to go. This after giving up a short handed goal which tied the game. #whl #OilKings

6953 2018-02-10 23:16:27 I would doubt many "oilman" in downtown Calgary would be "hard working" - at least not in the oil patch, as much as in the finance department.  There probably a good number of 'oil women' - do they feel endangered?  They're probably very much envied by any oilman 'out of work'.
6954 2018-02-10 23:15:35 @Oil_Wrestler thanks for retweeting really appreciated X

6959 2018-02-10 23:15:07 i think either the meat or oil that they use
6960 2018-02-10 23:14:56 Wait until she opens up your state to more drilling for oil!
6961 2018-02-10 23:14:54 What a game!!! Best game Ever! Keep up the Amazing Work!! Go Oil kings Go! Proud of you Guys!!!!
6962 2018-02-10 23:14:53 私も友人がプレイしてるのを聞いたり動画見たりしてただけなんですよね....

6963 2018-02-10 23:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
6964 2018-02-10 23:14:26 Canola oil is a great snack when you’re in a hurry. Just one swig and you’re filled up!
6965 2018-02-10 23:14:20 Must be very hard for unionists at the moment. ScotGov been doing the day job from day 1 (&they know it). UK admit life under Brexit is going to be shit. Can’t speak about oil. They know Ruthie is a nobody. For all their supercilious, childish belief they are superior, they ain’t
6966 2018-02-10 23:14:14 I use vinegar with lavender and tea tree oil. I don't mind the smell.
6967 2018-02-10 23:14:12 It may seem silly but have you tried an oil burner in your room. Aromatherapy may not cure illnes but it can be good for relaxing the mind.
6968 2018-02-10 23:13:55 New tires and an oil change got the Chevy ridin like a Bentley
6969 2018-02-10 23:13:55 Gabriel turned Sam into the impala Dean took holy oil out of the trunk to trap Gabriel when they figured out he wasn’t a “trickster” but an angel.  So they literally pulled it out of Sam’s ass.  So to speak.

6978 2018-02-10 23:13:04 and if they extracted oil from birch bark there, would that make it terf turf tar?
6979 2018-02-10 23:13:02 Such a bizarre game. Rebels tie it shorthanded with a little over a minute to go, Oil Kings win it with 7 ticks on the clock. Huge points slip away from Rebels.
6980 2018-02-10 23:12:54 No oil pipeline
6981 2018-02-10 23:12:33 The one i had was very dry, the frosting was weeping (like there was too much oil or butter) and it just wasnt good.
6982 2018-02-10 23:12:14 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.

6986 2018-02-10 23:11:53 Trump is a reality TV star and real estate con man. A snake oil salesman, Trump knows people are always looking to buy the next miracle cure. He is not a Republican, not a conservative but an opportunist who is morally bankrupt.
6987 2018-02-10 23:11:48 someone buy me oil paints so I can paint minseok
6988 2018-02-10 23:11:41 absolutely it would be economic suicide at least for the initial post UK period & for God knows how long afterwards. The pro Indy supporters want to cut off their noses to spite their faces. They're all sentimentality Braveheart, oil & whisky & no regard for reality
6989 2018-02-10 23:11:39 Point streak is over at nine games for @Rebelshockey wild finish to this one. Seemed like the teams were sleeping through 40, certainly awake in the final 20. Oil Kings win 4-3.
6990 2018-02-10 23:11:33 if it's intensely itchy (like with my eczema on my hands) I run under hot water and then cold water, stops itching for a little while, got to keep applying light Vaseline. cotton gloves. used to use cocoa butter stick and pure coconut oil but started reacting to it.
6991 2018-02-10 23:11:24 Use an oil then a gentle shampoo to wash the glue bits
6992 2018-02-10 23:11:15 Cigarette tax, fuel tax, low GPT, and wind tax 1) hurts low-income families, 2) lets oil barons off the hook indefinitely, 3) discourages diversification of our economy, which is a huge part of why we're in the situation we're in now.
6993 2018-02-10 23:11:09 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: raw crust with spicy motor oil and cheese.
6994 2018-02-10 23:10:57 Trey Fix-Wolansky with the game-winner with 8.6 seconds left for the Edmonton Oil Kings. What a fun WHL game on national television with three excellent late goals.
6995 2018-02-10 23:10:54 Fusion too ridiculous an alternative for a small country like Scotland. And too dangerous. We’ve got oil for 100 yrs, and renewables galore ever increasing. Are you nenergy ‘expert’.ive seen kids with leukaemia from nuclear power stations nearby, convince me.
6996 2018-02-10 23:10:53 Memories of a Caribbean childhood ... I tell you. Castor oil was no joke as well. Someone was always trying to clean out your pipes. My kids don’t know how damn lucky they were to be born and raised here instead. They missed all these fun treats.
6997 2018-02-10 23:10:48 たらこって美味いよな！
6998 2018-02-10 23:10:47 olive oil has less linolenic (which linoleic converts to in our digestive processes) and slightly more oleic, on average.
6999 2018-02-10 23:10:41 They were effectively out of it when they sh#t the bed after Christmas.  So any analysis to this effect is little more than ‘captain obvious ‘ content

7001 2018-02-10 23:10:22 Luckily you dont use any oil...
7002 2018-02-10 23:10:18 Mr. Trudeau...you better start building ties within your own country specifically Western Canada. Western alienation is now rampant. Your lack of support for our Oil industry in Alberta is causing worse damage than your father did with the NEP....
7003 2018-02-10 23:10:18 @matthewsyed @queenchristina_ #skypapers Water company profits would be shared with the Government if the Govt was a sleeping partner, which it has a right to be, since the water is British. Compare oil company royalties. Compare Norwegian Statoil. Also moderates executive pay.
7004 2018-02-10 23:10:17 Annnd Oil Kings score? Trey Fix-Wolanksy deflects it in with skate with 7 seconds left. 4-3 Oil Kings. Wild game.

7007 2018-02-10 23:09:54 Every oil has beneficial effects and deleterous effects if taken in large enough quantities. Wanna know the funny thing? Canola oil- also known as rapeseed oil- contains the same basic fatty acid profile as olive oil. 50-60% oleic, 17-20% linoleic, 4-5% palmitic ~10% linolenic.

7009 2018-02-10 23:09:13 Oil Kings give up a shorty with less 2m in the game nursing a 3-2 lead making it 3-3. 

I said Oil Kings correct? Ya good just checking.
7010 2018-02-10 23:09:09 By year 2025, it would be much harder for Iran to make oil revenues at current levels due to not investing in technology that extracts oil from much deeper layers. Oil prices are also declining due to renewable energy and US becoming a major exporter.

7014 2018-02-10 23:08:53 If you live somewhere that you can get CBD oil (somewhere medical cannabis is legal), it can be applied topically to the painful area and it will relieve pain although if it is pure CBD you will not feel high.
7015 2018-02-10 23:08:17 Someone just told me it’s 3 months or 300,000 miles before you need an oil change...

7017 2018-02-10 23:07:02 Reasons won’t find:

- because of unprecedented oil revenue between 11-14, we finally fixed our power problem
7018 2018-02-10 23:06:33 Could try clove oil on the sore gum
7019 2018-02-10 23:06:11 i once saw Immodest Gymnasts open for Rites of Spring and Midnight Oil, i think
7020 2018-02-10 23:06:00 Documentary on TV "Gans & Oil" showing Chicago particularly south side being more dangerous than Iraq. Gun violence biggest part of life. #sad 
7021 2018-02-10 23:05:54 Well, it's a pore minimizing primer so it's going do well making large pores smaller, but in regards to oiliness/acne it's not it's main concern tho it helps a bit with the oil. It smells good 
7022 2018-02-10 23:05:53 I love olive oil - I put it on salads,spaghetti,lots of things. Is good for you and it's delicious,too 
7023 2018-02-10 23:05:50 like when Russian oligarchs skimmed off the oil & gas boom of the 2000s, skipping domestic investment. which then directly led to Putin's hysterical nationalism...
7024 2018-02-10 23:05:27 Downside of using coconut oil as a moisturiser is my face smells like a Bounty 
7025 2018-02-10 23:05:25 I mean baby oil* lol
7026 2018-02-10 23:05:22 Tru! I have tried tarte’s maracuja oil with it and it works but idk I just feel like I shouldnt have to get another product for it to work - that being said tho I have been working on my skin in general so maybe its worth another shot 
7027 2018-02-10 23:05:17 Hey, can you throw in a little oil and garlic. And turn up the heat a little. Thanks.
7028 2018-02-10 23:05:16 Pls rub baby oil on her skin
7029 2018-02-10 23:05:10 Got any clove oil/cloves?
7030 2018-02-10 23:04:53 i just spilled half of my mostly melted cocunut oil but on another note, my bed is made w/ freshly washed sheets so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ #overit
7031 2018-02-10 23:04:52 Lentils.
[54] Take lentils washed well and with stones picked out, and set them to cook with savory herbs, oil, salt and saffron.  And when they are cooked, mince them well; and put beaten eggs on top, and sliced dry cheese, serve.

7034 2018-02-10 23:03:58 I can't tell if you're being serious. You can't be. Do his followers REALLY believe Republicans are spearheading a DACA solution? You really are a Carney snake oil salesmen. Unbelievable.
7035 2018-02-10 23:03:57 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
7036 2018-02-10 23:03:43 Yeaaa i can feel you on that. They could leave em in the oil a little longer lol
7037 2018-02-10 23:03:37 If you apply an oil (that’s meant to be put into makeup ofc) to your beauty sponge before blending out the concealer it won’t feel so drying!!
7038 2018-02-10 23:03:26 Pipelines leak constantly. When they are transporting poising, they leak poison. Pipelines are economically the safest way for these companies to transport oil, but then it leaks into your water supply and you're stuck buying Evian water. Spell it backwards and it says Naive.
7039 2018-02-10 23:03:16 I have this coconut oil and it’s become foreign as to how I can use it. Specifically for my hair. I need help
7040 2018-02-10 23:02:57 Internet is the only way to get the truth out. I have a friend in Syria, they all know the truth but have no voice, this war is big oil & bank and the US media keeps truth from it's citizens to hide truth
7041 2018-02-10 23:02:47 Idk about it being the healthiest, bu5 I do know it helps your veins and heart. But too much of any oil is bad for you
7042 2018-02-10 23:02:46 Lybian oil is in general much better quality.
7043 2018-02-10 23:02:44 This is true. Across the Med, a 'salad' is little else but olive oil, oregano, and salt on something.

7046 2018-02-10 23:02:04 States the TreasonWeasel under investigation by not just our country, but by all but his good comrades the Russians. TreasonWeasel has allowed sanctioned Russian oil & gas to be sold in our country, violating our constitution. TreasonWeasel allowed highly sanctioned Ru spies in.

7048 2018-02-10 23:01:52 Strange country:
November 2008: satellite we built for 40 billion disappears

September 2004: Ship laden with 30,000 barrels of oil disappears 

August 2017: Rats chase the President out of office 

February 2018: Snake swallows 36 million from JAMB

Which country please???
7049 2018-02-10 23:01:38 Incorrect. Olive oil contains a lot of oleic and linoleic fatty acids, but they aren't inherantly more healthy for you than palmitic or stearic acids (which it also has a fair amount of). There's loads of claims that "Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the healthiest oil on earth!" but >
7050 2018-02-10 23:01:34 Not sure you’d make it to the third time.
7051 2018-02-10 23:01:33 get some new GOLF shirts or an oil change??
7052 2018-02-10 23:01:30 If I wanted to hear a sermon I would go to church... Scheer and Kenney are preaches to the core... when they aren't elected I'm sure they can get a job as travelling evangelists... snake oil anyone?
7053 2018-02-10 23:01:23 Where does "the guy from Tonga who wears coconut oil instead of a shirt" fall in this?
7054 2018-02-10 23:01:14 It should be sold to seniors with chronic pain syndromes such as small fiber neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, etc., and not in CBD oil form.  Let the patient have a voice in which medication they prefer...opiates or natural herbs.
7055 2018-02-10 23:01:00 This team needs a bit more than an oil change...
7056 2018-02-10 23:00:30 I think it’s mainly b/c it’s been an argument put forward by nationalists since the 1980s (“It’s our oil”, etc).

This idea Scotland is being bled dry by its domineering English master is very much part of Nationalist thinking IMO.

7067 2018-02-10 22:59:08 Use like an oil based product
7068 2018-02-10 22:58:57 I watched that recently when I was drunk and pissed off at the world. Where I live, everything is about oil, country music, religion, "weed is evil," and republicans. It's nice to be able to escape that and hear a voice of reason.
7069 2018-02-10 22:58:51 Gold standard cancelled by Nixon. OPEC oil Embargo. High prices due to world shortages. Oh, and Labour government delivering more surplus and paying more debt off than Tories since 1945!
7070 2018-02-10 22:58:45 Oil will stay put for a few weeks....

7079 2018-02-10 22:57:21 I love my woman, I’m out of town rn & she’s on her own getting the oil changed for the car! That’s my baby 
7080 2018-02-10 22:57:12 the lack of insight in such a statement is startling. The US is occupying Syria and funding both sides in a conflict between the Turks and Kurds to enable it to pillage the oil reserves and you accuse someone condemning that as having an imperialist game?
7081 2018-02-10 22:56:59 Yup tired of horrible Horgan & his greenies starving Canadian oil yet  pumping gas into their Vehicles

7083 2018-02-10 22:56:57 not just us -every body is a market for Arabs-but with OPEC controls and america not exporting oil everyone is at mercy of OPEC- i guess you havent been reading news papers -its a supplier market-belonging to one race- you cant pee on saudi and expect oil from UAE @AartiTikoo
7084 2018-02-10 22:56:51 Have you got any coconut oil?? That might just save you!!!

7087 2018-02-10 22:56:18 My wife's family's from rural SK, which has slowly shed people as farming's gotten larger-scale. An oil boom got things charged up for a while, but it's receded.  Ppl in town still doing OK, though, partly b/c of more efforts to maintain a safety net & local infrastructure.
7088 2018-02-10 22:56:13 Is lots of olive oil in a Mediterranean diet,too,which is very good for you. Mediterranean diet = long life
7089 2018-02-10 22:55:59 Olive oil, grpfrt juice, honey, Dijon, and loads of fresh cracked pepper. Once dressed, season w a bit of @maldonsalt

7096 2018-02-10 22:54:36 Oligarchs wanting their war profiteering ramped up for oil and $$$
Talk to the actual citizens. You won't get much support world wide as you think.
7097 2018-02-10 22:54:35 Adulting for me is being 22 & finally making a grocery list each week and (mostly) sticking to it. Not adulting is spending money on a teeny tiny bottle of olive oil because it’s “cute.” 
7098 2018-02-10 22:54:34 CBD Oil is always the go to after a hard workout. 
7099 2018-02-10 22:54:22 orange oil is very volatile.
7100 2018-02-10 22:54:20 Clearly Alberta is putting their efforts into nonrenewable energies. What makes you think Alberta would "use the alternative" if they managed to find one. Things don't come knocking at your door if you want something you gotta fight for it, Alberta fights for oil.
7101 2018-02-10 22:54:06 Also you are using a graphic the predicts the future whicb is impossible. Even if you use "trends" predicting the economy of nations is impossible. For example. The ME would devolve into utter chaos of the oil dried up.
7102 2018-02-10 22:54:02 A diet study was done on the longevity of the people of Crete. One plus is that the majority of the diet there is unprocessed food.  But the greatest contributing food factor to their health? 'Xorta'. Dandelion leaves. Boil it, then mix with a little olive oil and lemon juice.
7103 2018-02-10 22:53:53 No one is anything, even the huge fucking dinosaurs turned into oil of which we now make plastic to make a toothbrush, but that doesnt mean you can change anything. You change the life of everone you meet, some more than others, but you change them and make them better
7104 2018-02-10 22:53:52 That’s what oil money does

7116 2018-02-10 22:51:55 Oooo I didn’t try beauty oil! Yea I thought I had oily skin but no def combo so it doesn’t move on my face
7117 2018-02-10 22:51:48 Be more respectful of olive oil.
7118 2018-02-10 22:51:40 You could be 100 per cent about the spill properties of dilbit, but that does not change the fact that tripling exports of any crude oil or bitumen product from the BC terminals means tripling the risk of accidents. I don't see a way around that.
7119 2018-02-10 22:51:33 Are taking a look at @RonnieOs55R we found a chunk of bar in his trunk. It seems someone's bar went threw Ronnie grill and to the trunk and knocked an oil line off! He did a great job just not his day!

7122 2018-02-10 22:51:03 Hey @MuhWhiteGenocid ,can you really not understand what @GoblinsBlade is saying?
Your own figures show SA importing R7Bn worth of food. Now ask yourself @GoblinsBlade 's question again:Why are we importing food? Chicken? Maize? Palm oil? Mostly things we could be producing here.
7123 2018-02-10 22:51:00 I baru start buat double cleansing ( HL cleansing oil + garden of eden cleanser) and lepas pakai for about less than a week, my skin dekat area pipi and hidung mcm kering and mengelupas. Is it normal? Fyi, my skin type is combo. Tq for sharing :) #tanyaTK

7128 2018-02-10 22:49:56 You’ll need the cannabis oil that contains some THC for the best  pain relief, but plain non-THC CBD oil, which is legal about everywhere, is a great anti-inflammatory for overall health 
7129 2018-02-10 22:49:52 Uh oh. I might be making my pasta wrong. What does the salt do to the water? I usually put olive oil in my pasta water.
7130 2018-02-10 22:49:48 Puts numbing oil on my neck and back and then eat with the same hand bc I will never learn
7131 2018-02-10 22:49:43 I finally got the car to start but needs engine oil so as soon as i get that poppin then i should be gudd
7132 2018-02-10 22:49:40 Whilst some people are throwing their own olive oil about. I add olive oil to my online shopping list..
7133 2018-02-10 22:49:26 That's over 50,000 quarts of oil!
7134 2018-02-10 22:49:23 Christie Clark is no longer part of BC government even though she is paid by oil lobby money now
7135 2018-02-10 22:49:22 Swing oil
7136 2018-02-10 22:49:18 It CAN'T pump, it's 100% premined and value pegged to 1 barrel of Venezuelan oil, you're better off investing in oil futures.
7137 2018-02-10 22:49:09 I had an oil tanker w/the Sinclair logo on it! LOVED IT
7138 2018-02-10 22:49:03 This happened to the whalers when we discovered crude oil. Happened to the carriage industry when we went horseless. Happened to computer programmers in the 80’s. It’s called progress.

7140 2018-02-10 22:48:49 Nah, it'll just be some oil spills and another 50 billion for Rex Tillerson.  Stop lying!
7141 2018-02-10 22:48:31 The end goal, as it always has been is Iran, and its oil. Syria is just a stepping stone. If US/West provokes war with Iran, we need mass disobedience in the West. Expect false flags attacks to justify war/vilify Iran+Syria
7142 2018-02-10 22:48:18 Exactly. And it worsens the carbon intensity of that oil, anyway, due to the emissions associated with running the EOR process to begin with. It's an additive problem that only makes sense from a "how do we make money here?" perspective, IMO.
7143 2018-02-10 22:47:46 Just ordered 4 sizes of spiders and an oil gunk skimmer. That’s 11 kitchen items coming Monday!
7144 2018-02-10 22:47:44 Grabs a can of oil and inserts his trunk into it.

Drink drink drink.
7145 2018-02-10 22:47:40 @realDonaldTrump I think we should drill for oil at Mar A Lago also...if it is ok to ruin the eastern US coastline than it should be ok to ruin Mar A Lago with an oil spill also...!
7146 2018-02-10 22:47:36 I actually do oil pulling and I believe I feel the difference on the days that I don’t
7147 2018-02-10 22:47:23 yeah, I don't want to fuck around with motor oil or the gasses in flourescents either, all of that shit is BEYOND bad for us organic things.
7148 2018-02-10 22:47:15 If the oil sands were located in Quebec/Ontario that pipeline to tidewater would have been built years ago and any mention of global warming would have put a price on your head. Ottawa has always been jealous of the West's prosperity.

7151 2018-02-10 22:46:43 girl me too!! The ONLY thing that ever helped my breakouts was acne SCRUBS with beads in them. It really gets under the skin to exfoliate the dirt and oil. St. Ives is probably my favorite 
7152 2018-02-10 22:46:42 Went and bought the night facial oil before coming back after Christmas. Lovely product 
7153 2018-02-10 22:46:14 #Shell cash flow from operations was $39 billion in 2017 with a Brent price of $54 per barrel. This figure was close to the 2014 one when the oil price was $99/b
7154 2018-02-10 22:46:12 They've hidden a city right on the horizon. So many boats — so many lights. There's a perpetual sunset of oil fire.
7155 2018-02-10 22:46:11 She will be speaking at Berkeley an Harvard soon. 
And beeoch Nazi Pelosi will have her standing next to her at rallies .
7156 2018-02-10 22:46:08 A bizarre argument is specifying that you've been done with oil since 2015 yet you're tweeting with a device resultant from oil.
7157 2018-02-10 22:46:07 While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
7158 2018-02-10 22:46:06 Yes but when a country owns you with oil money that usually happens Roman at Chelsea knows he can’t match them so he has basically stopped trying
7159 2018-02-10 22:45:52 Another olive oil went on me in the pantry. WTF is going on in this joint? Poltergeist?
7160 2018-02-10 22:45:46 Stir together 3 pints ginger with 1 cup daily bread. Add Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve over basmati rice.
7161 2018-02-10 22:45:17 Ridiculous argument. There's many different types of oil. Some are fine. Bitumen is not.
7162 2018-02-10 22:45:03 Yes! Not ridiculous btw. So, cleanse, pat dry, then use the AHA/BHA treatment (only use this at night), then moisturizer, facial oil (if applicable), and sunscreen in the morning/daytime. It takes 4-6 weeks to see full results of a new skin care regimen as well 
7163 2018-02-10 22:44:46 So like one, maybe two people... I have a crook back but would like to. Let me get the oil and see if I can lube this thing #lube
7164 2018-02-10 22:44:37 thank you! yeah i love it, it really helps with oil control, plus its long lasting
7165 2018-02-10 22:44:32 @JamesHasson20 WHICH PREOCCUPIED THE CHURCHES AS THEY REROUTED THE OIL TO ITALY. THERE TRYING TO BLOW UP UP ITALY JUST LIKE ENGLANDS  JUST LIKE OUR FIRES BLAMING BUSINESS MEN NOT IN ELECTRONICS
7166 2018-02-10 22:44:02 Maybe you're to stressed? Stress does strange things, I've had periods I slept not more than 2 hrs. What can help is spread 4 drops of lavendel oil on your pillow
7167 2018-02-10 22:43:49 Got the Nomada and Spotted Bee Fly, have yet to find Oil Beetles in my lawn
7168 2018-02-10 22:43:48 @jeffphilips1discovering crude oil in large quantities will be a great news. The terrain will be easier to drill than the swampy delta
7169 2018-02-10 22:43:13 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
7170 2018-02-10 22:43:07 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
7171 2018-02-10 22:42:49 lol he is indeed - but my far greater fear than the pipeline not going thru, is that if RN doesn’t get it done, we’ll end up JK. To me, that’s scarier than an Alta-located oil spill. Lived through the nightmare-Klein years. We just closed our eyes & waited for it to end.
7172 2018-02-10 22:42:39 That's right. Your father makes homemade olive oil. Sounds wonderful.
7173 2018-02-10 22:42:19 There's already enough traffic there and there was recently a serious problem with a stranded tanker that was, thankfully, resolved safely.
Tripling the traffic means tripling the danger. Why do you want to risk the lives of those who live in the land water for oil barrons?
7174 2018-02-10 22:41:56 Guess I’ll go get my oil changed
7175 2018-02-10 22:41:39 @JamesHasson20 LET ME TELL U HOW THIS CIVERNMENT AND ENGLAND WENT AFTER RUSSIA'S OIL WW2 THEN LYBIA THEN JAPAN KOREA THEN VIETNAMS OIL ITS THE MEDIA DESTROYING OUR COUNTRIES AND FLUKE AZZ MF BUSINESZ.

7177 2018-02-10 22:41:17 Oil Kings David Kope tips home a point shot. Goals coming fast and furious in this one. 2-2, 13 minutes left in the third.
7178 2018-02-10 22:41:11 When did draft kings take over the Edmonton Oil Kings?
7179 2018-02-10 22:41:06 You Don see work for oil company naa
7180 2018-02-10 22:40:50 In the middle of debating with my mother about where we should store the oil it hit me that this is probably preparing me for married life.... except that in my version of married life...its always my way because I'm always right
7181 2018-02-10 22:40:44 your telling me that you have no turks running drugs??? Um.Turkey is where all the terror money, oil,, drugs,,,etc,,end up,,,from here it goes out west,,,Turkey is a mafia run state,,, you must be blind to not see Turkey is the biggest drug market in the middle east.
7182 2018-02-10 22:40:40 i get prickily heat from using oil’s on holibags! Pop a antihistamine and a lil bit of fairy liquid in the shower 
7183 2018-02-10 22:40:34 What relaxers have you used? Kits? 
If you do decide to go natural shea butter and coconut oil are your best friends. Lots of natural hair care accounts abound on instagram,  I'd recommend bellz_nhcc (genuine products @ great prices)

7192 2018-02-10 22:39:32 Don’t be so sure about ‘years & years.’

Look up “Desalination Membrane Market” and “The Desalination Megatrend.” 

You can “Forget oil, the next investment mega-trend will be water”

What does @PeterGleick think and say about the promise of desalination.

Recall Solar in 80's?
7193 2018-02-10 22:39:29 For those who always think FG’s search for oil in the Chad Basin is a wasted effort, there’s a Mobil crude production facility in Kome, Chad, few kms away from Maiduguri.
Some who work on rotation in the plant used to live in Maiduguri 
Have been there thrice, wasn’t told
7194 2018-02-10 22:39:20 Semantics 
Republicans believe the 2% of scientists that don't believe in climate change.
Maybe it's because big oil owns them and there's profits to think of.
Either way, stop redefining the original point.
If Trump is innocent, he should embrace the investigation.
Why fight it?

7211 2018-02-10 22:36:55 time to get on that oil
7212 2018-02-10 22:36:52 Try oil? If it sticks to the Grain they may eat it? Or wet the Grain if they will eat it that way. Apple juice or sauce works if they will eat that. Or good old syringe it right into the mouth.
7213 2018-02-10 22:36:52 Ik plaats van bier afpakken had je beter oil of olav kunnen kopen. Dat je er oud uitziet is jouw probleem. Niet de hare.

7219 2018-02-10 22:35:49 The United States imports 8 million barrels of oil per day... and then we burn it.  We pay like $500 million per day for that... and then they lend us the money so we can import more oil.
 
All politicians need to know this.

7225 2018-02-10 22:35:14 Yaaaaassssss!!  Or "essential oil," eat, exercise, etcetera it away.  It is a chronic illness and requires multiple layers or angles of treatment - to each person, a different treatment plan & path.
7226 2018-02-10 22:35:13 John Connally sent by Nixon had not long since delivered the news about the gold standard and the Saudis had declared oil price war. Any government would have been in the same boat.

7242 2018-02-10 22:33:21 I wasn't aware of the oil deal. It's good that people are now waking up to the threat to our western culture. Populism seems to be on the rise throughout Europe and hopefully it's not too late.

7246 2018-02-10 22:32:47 When I was a kid I learnt at school that Alberta had tons of oil but it was expensive and dirty to extract so it would never be used. I was shocked when Harper started up that mess. Trudeau inherited the mess, but there are contracts in place and it will take time to decommission
7247 2018-02-10 22:32:45 when you find oil and decide you need more "for security", that's transparently wrong.
7248 2018-02-10 22:32:36 You don't think that Israel suddenly deciding it's entitled to more of the Golan than previously because oil was discovered there is wrong? Hmmm. Selective. I was behind Israel's occupation because of the Syrian artillery attack, but...

7253 2018-02-10 22:32:23 Due to your countries bloody interests in Syria focusing on Oil,  giving support to pkk-ypg-pyd terrorism. In Turkey, at least 90% of Kurd population are against pkk-ypg-pyd.

7261 2018-02-10 22:31:02 Low oil increases returns on forward looking markets, not the other way around.  By all means, explain how this claim is wrong.  I'll gladly examine the opposite view.
7262 2018-02-10 22:30:55 So important. I am totally reliant on mechanics (MEN) when it comes to my car.

I can put air in tires, gas in and check oil levels.

7263 2018-02-10 22:30:51 Quebec imports oil from Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigera, Angola & Iraq, doubling the ecological impact. Good job #hypocrites!
7264 2018-02-10 22:30:48 Has America fueled the fire and exacerbated these tensions leading to war? Absolutely.This is admitted by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Five months before 9/11 Cheney called for ' using force against Iraq … to secure control of its oil. Iran - Iraq Afghanistan
7265 2018-02-10 22:30:38 I went high b/c 1. Whatever fossil emissions remaining should come from NG not oil, 2. Industrial NG w/CCS is great, feasible, and low impact, 3.

7268 2018-02-10 22:30:34 Is Nigeria the only country depending solely on oil... Dropped or not, the country is sinking into poverty, hope we don't become Venezuela..

7270 2018-02-10 22:30:26 Mmmmm that would be awesome. Moon rocks are great as long as you get the right ones (or make them) the ones I got recently were from Kaviar but they really sucked, there was no bud in them, just crappy oil barely dusted with keef.

7280 2018-02-10 22:28:58 Coconut oil, however, IS comedogenic. On a scale of 5 being the most comedogenic, it’s a 4 (just looked up that little fact)
7281 2018-02-10 22:28:43 CO2 is not a pollutant, it is normally occurring gas, vitally important for all plants, and they actually need more. All carbon in oil and coal used to be in atmosphere and at some point was traped and excluded from the natural cycle. And 0.04% is dangerously low in fact.
7282 2018-02-10 22:28:21 It feel so good to oil my scalp
7283 2018-02-10 22:28:21 Haven't slept since yesterday morning, accidentally burnt my left hand with frying oil, and tore up my jeans.

7288 2018-02-10 22:27:29 Love those. And ridiculously cheap. The mushroom truffle oil one is great too.
7289 2018-02-10 22:27:28 I think Butts and his leftist clan should concentrate on foreign producers and there lack of carbon capture. We have one of the best systems in place for oil, gas and coal.
7290 2018-02-10 22:27:18 Coconut oil is the answer  
7291 2018-02-10 22:26:52 It's all bullshit and you know it. Maybe the @gop needs to better police its own, so it doesn't nominate a criminal snake oil salesman in the future.

I like acrylic painting for mixed medium but im going to do strictly oil composed paintings next... I like color saturation A LOT
7295 2018-02-10 22:26:35 Don’t use any lotion which contains oil! Just cream! The oil makes your skin bubble

7298 2018-02-10 22:26:07 You may have to try it w a beauty oil. If your skin is even partly dry, you’re not going to enjoy Fenty. Bc of how matte it is. If you still want to achieve a matte look, a finishing spray works better.
7299 2018-02-10 22:26:05 That oil has a extremely strong flavor. It is interesting with fish.

7304 2018-02-10 22:25:02 Something I don't see discussed a lot: how much universal healthcare would cut down on bogus snake oil, which often has markets built on being cheaper/easier to get than actual, effective care.
7305 2018-02-10 22:24:56 “they go together like oil and water” lmaooo
7306 2018-02-10 22:24:54 i'm not about to complain about a massage but if you could maybe not get massage oil all up in my hair less than 10 hours after i've washed it that would be great thanks
7307 2018-02-10 22:24:36 Love: Urban Decay x Basquiat Gold Griot eyeshadow palette

7308 2018-02-10 22:24:24 Hey @LaughlinSXM just turned on TV & @sheldoncreed is leading the ARCA Lucas Oil 200  50 laps to go 
7309 2018-02-10 22:24:02 Maybe try lubing it up with some bio oil then teasing it out kinda angled. Like when you put in/take out a saddled plug- I can’t really explain what I mean fully, hope it makes sense?!?!
7310 2018-02-10 22:23:44 My dads a real one buying my oil and gunna change it for me 
7311 2018-02-10 22:23:39 *ignoring the known health risks as well as the correlated health risks
7312 2018-02-10 22:23:10 >he doesn’t know how to change oil

7316 2018-02-10 22:22:42 $25,000 for a oil change?? LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOILLBEWALKINGOOOOOOOOOOOO
7317 2018-02-10 22:22:36 Did you hit the oil? That’s usually what gives me prickly heat. Stick to cream x
7318 2018-02-10 22:22:36 So instead we let foreign oil companies, like BP drill,  and put us at risk of an oil spill and stealing our wealth. Guess you want us to keep paying billions for oil, to countries that hate us,  and transfer our wealth to them.  No thanks
7319 2018-02-10 22:22:36 EXACTLY the uk hasn’t even saved the national insurance contributions we’ve all been paying. Let alone oil revenue. everything has been spent. Not to even mention the cost of #Brexit administration. On top of the QE + loss of gdp £WTF is happening @BBCNews . #StopBrexit
7320 2018-02-10 22:22:33 Dad used to bend it to spray oil into the fire. It also makes rainbows if it’s in a puddle and you step on it.
7321 2018-02-10 22:22:12 Otesanya Ogungbe Oyinkansola received N50800 from Caleb Oyeyinka Oyinkansola being payment for Palm Oil
7322 2018-02-10 22:22:11 I cant risk losing my regular pain and nerve pain meds :( I might try vaping Cannabis oil again as that's legal but I need to work with my drs at the pain clinic. Its a very tricky thing.  I will not be able to handle no meds it would kill me
7323 2018-02-10 22:22:08 Have you tried adding MCT oil to your coffee?
7324 2018-02-10 22:21:47 Yeah. This was my practice piece. First time using Oil paint. So I would just want to do a better one. But if you want one done. Hit me up 
7325 2018-02-10 22:21:21 making some oil, time to get swifty in here
7326 2018-02-10 22:21:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
7327 2018-02-10 22:20:45 Upbringing trumps income.
Like Mr. Scheer I grew up in a modest family. Later in life I earned incomes similar to what he gets now.
And yet I kept buying clothes on sale and changing the oil on my 12-year old truck.
Money doesn't turn an average guy into an aristocrat..
7328 2018-02-10 22:20:26 The Golan belongs to Syria, not Israel..  Israel illegally occupies parts of the region, in order to steal Syrian Oil....but this doesn't mean they can claim their 'airspace was violated' lol
7329 2018-02-10 22:20:13 i'm from matt gaetz's district, its so baffling to me he could propose anti-EPA bill repping an area so heavily affected by oil spills
7330 2018-02-10 22:20:08 I smoke enough weed/oil on daily to put @WillieNelson an @tommychong to sleep #wedontsmokethesame #getonmylevel #jointrollerlife #youthinkyoucanhang #idareyoutocomesmoke

7332 2018-02-10 22:19:59 Use dry oil. It’s the sun creams that usually cause prickly heat x
7333 2018-02-10 22:19:56 There's no such thing as overdoing "Oil Tot"! Your a talented builder and it's time that you know it! I can't wait for it's release!
7334 2018-02-10 22:19:27 My Mother told me LBJ was always corrupt. She told me he stole oil wells in Texas. That must have been around 1967 or thereabout.  Both of my parents were WWII Vets. They would never have supported a democrat. They ruined California, and we were all born there.
7335 2018-02-10 22:19:13 After a day spent looking at motors, I’ve finally made up my mind.  I am keeping my 3 series oil burner.  It’s 10 year old and still drives better than anything I tested today.
7336 2018-02-10 22:19:12 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
7337 2018-02-10 22:19:06 My mom made a cake with rancid oil and I was the only one rude enough to say anything about it. AMA.
7338 2018-02-10 22:19:05 Except in the 80s Thatcher used the huge North Sea oil revenues and sold our nations nationalised industries as a crutch to prop up a stagnant economy.
7339 2018-02-10 22:19:01 Oil, gas and coal are lying again.
7340 2018-02-10 22:19:01 You know what else escalated quickly? ...........the cost of importing oil during the Bush administration.
7341 2018-02-10 22:18:46 I also use dry oil aswell and I don’t get prickly heat with that
7342 2018-02-10 22:18:45 I have been asking the FSG Out Twitter the same question and none have an answer apart from out LFC up for sale and none have said let the fans run it. That is my preference too but I suspect all some want is a billionaire oil Sheikh.
7343 2018-02-10 22:18:42 Israel get most of the oil from Russia and still don't give fuck!!!Arab "COWARDS" countries  have thousands of modern fighter jets ,but no ball's as usual.
p.s Go buy more Picasso paint FAGS

7347 2018-02-10 22:18:00 Did you know that @RutgersDining has a Vegawatt generator? It is a modified diesel engine that burns vegetable oil. The discarded oil from the dining halls is collected and goes to the Vegawatt on Busch & is converted into electricity & hot water for the building. That’s so cool!
7348 2018-02-10 22:17:31 use tea tree oil with a crushed aspirin mixed with water, dab it on, leave it on over night, it helps shrink it and do it every night until it’s gone
7349 2018-02-10 22:17:25 Facts:
• oil is part of every part of your life
• equalization payments are partially resultant of oil
• BCs position is in violation of law
• inadequate alternatives will not suffice in the foreseeable future
• AB $ are essential for strong national economy

7352 2018-02-10 22:16:32 Your showing your age Trump.  My 98 year old Grandpa got all of his “news” from Faux.  Your a snake oil salesman and your followers will not get better.  Poor suckers will get worse. Unless their in the 1%
7353 2018-02-10 22:16:25 I reckon they are like the old V8s in Cuba held together with sticky tape and hope. With vosene and baby oil for brake fluid! 
7354 2018-02-10 22:16:23 Suncor's way of extracting oil seems better than more polluting means of extracting oil, but as Greenpeace pointed out, it can still be very damaging for the environment. #Lesson5 #Suncor #Greenpeace
7355 2018-02-10 22:16:08 I don’t know who perpetrated this propaganda that truffle oil was an expensive unrealistic luxury because I just picked up a bottle for £3 and it has magically transformed my mashed potato I’ll have you know
7356 2018-02-10 22:16:06 I love products like Cannaceuticals CBD7 with Cbd oil in it. My skin has never felt better.
7357 2018-02-10 22:15:40 My little girl had prickly heat on holiday and we was advised by a pharmacist to use a high factor oil not a cream , might be worth a try it worked for her 
7358 2018-02-10 22:15:18 I just hear that sounds of thunder oil makes when it comes gushing out the earth
7359 2018-02-10 22:15:14 Es que cristiano brilla porque tiene mucha grasa en la cara , debería usar bases de maquillajes oil free @Cristiano
7360 2018-02-10 22:15:13 I need an oil change
7361 2018-02-10 22:15:08 Brcause its not oil..its dilbit. Refine it in Alberta, ship it as oil, much of the issues disappear.
7362 2018-02-10 22:15:05 Question for all you environmental warriors?? Why only protest Alberta oil and not middle eastern oil coming daily Eastern  Canada.. is it because you won't get paid to do that??
7363 2018-02-10 22:14:36 #Shell forecasts that its global deepwater production will exceed 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020
7364 2018-02-10 22:14:03 20年ほど前、祖母が無くなった際医者にペースメーカーは仮想時に爆発するので釘で打って下さいと言われたけど打ったのかな？と思い出した
7365 2018-02-10 22:13:52 Pointless arguing with you about this. We just don't see the same things... oil led 2015 selloff, was the cause of the Jan 2016 blowup and it's pivot marked the bottom in Feb. Very big impact on USD & HY and energy earnings. Market traded sideways 2Y bc of oil selloff.
7366 2018-02-10 22:13:48 Use a dry oil spray as other creams will block your pores & that’s what the problem is.  My mother suffers with prickly heat

7371 2018-02-10 22:13:27 Hanging out at the crib today, just found out that Joaquin Caldwell is going to increase our oil industry by another 20% by the end of my term.
7372 2018-02-10 22:13:25 @cathmckenna You and your government are creating divisiveness. Take a look in the mirror. Trying to destroy Western Canada’s oil industry, calling Canadians racist, throwing money away to other countries like drunk sailors, creating taxes that are just a tax grab, etc, etc

7381 2018-02-10 22:12:15 And we have a caution. Seems oil off of the 99 has caused an issue off of turn 4. @AndySeuss, @RohrbaughRacing & @willrodgers65 involved.

7396 2018-02-10 22:10:53 That joke..worked better...when the USA...wasn’t the largest producer of oil...in the world..
7397 2018-02-10 22:10:42 Yeah, I even knew all this which makes the mistake more embarrassing. He wasn't the only one aping Frazetta at Warren. Beyond trying to emulate his oil painting technique, you can still see a truckload of artists copping his design sense. Have a few more Ken Kelly covers to post.
7398 2018-02-10 22:10:42 Poor minded People spend all their money  on materialistic things that depreciate in value (Clothes, Sneakers, Jewelry, cars), Rich minded people INVEST their money in things that Appreciate in value (Oil, Real Estate , Gold, Can goods)

7400 2018-02-10 22:10:39 I know someone who sells CBD oil and it’s apparently legal in ALL states because it contains less than 0.03% of THC. She says it helps with pain but I’ve never used it. If you want to connect with her lmk

It’s known technology and safely deployable.

7417 2018-02-10 22:08:56 It is the worst decision.  Utah makes over $12 billion annually from tourism!  People are not going to come see the night sky lit up like the Vegas strip for oil derricks nor will they put up w/large numbers of huge lumbering trucks! What happens when it goes bust?
7418 2018-02-10 22:08:55 Alarm bells are ringing on the federal debt: This is exactly what the Russian/Trump agenda is. Destroy the credit of our nation so they can take us over. Why do you think Trump is allowing Russia & China to exploit the minerals, gad, and oil of the North Pole without US actions?

7428 2018-02-10 22:07:33 ... She’d said oil for pets.
7429 2018-02-10 22:07:21 With Assad out of the way, he can buy Syrian oil from the anti-assad government. This oil has kept Syria free of any international debt (i.e. IMF loans from Rothschilds bank), giving all Syrian citizens a free education and free medical care.
7430 2018-02-10 22:07:10 The United Kingdom was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1970.   Remember those days.   Skint.   Power strikes.  National strikes poverty.  Then came Scottish OIL.  #scotref
7431 2018-02-10 22:06:54 @JohnJCampbell Happy Birthday John. My gift to you is to reiterate that you are truly one of the nicest men on the planet...and to thank you for turning the word ‘bugger’ into more of an exclamation for surprise. I hated the negative connotation. May the good oil be with you. 
7432 2018-02-10 22:06:48 Can't do nothing slick to a can of oil
7433 2018-02-10 22:06:15 Dems are just trying to delegitimize potus.  Crying safe spacers.  As was bushes war for oil, halliburton, etc.  This is nothing and a waste of time.  Name calling crybabies.

7441 2018-02-10 22:03:21 I didn't even know I wanted jasmine oil in my life until I tried some at the store half an hour ago but they were out of the actual product. Now I feel like half a human being without it. I am a husk without this amazingly beautiful-smelling oil.

7445 2018-02-10 22:02:55 You trying to have a conflict with the book and me being in your life okay so like I said I feel like you tried to poison me with this vegetable oil and now that I know that is something out of your household I'm going to try to bury you also, alright.
7446 2018-02-10 22:02:54 A lot of places here do 15 min oil changes. Cost a little more but worth it
7447 2018-02-10 22:02:29 That's the lowest I've seen the Nazi bar.

It literally transformed from dry, super frizzy, hay-like hair to smooth, moisturized, silky, healthy hair overnight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :O

7457 2018-02-10 22:01:23 Somehow comes to George at the maid rubbing oil on his desk. George: There was one of Jerry's building. Huh?
7458 2018-02-10 22:01:18 Anointing with oil service

7468 2018-02-10 22:00:07 i love pretending to know what im looking at when i get my oil change and they bring in that metal stick with oil on it
7469 2018-02-10 21:59:29 Hair Doctor is the perfect recommendation! This hot oil scalp treatment uses cooling peppermint oil and calming chamomile blue oil to soothe and treat dry, sensitive scalps. 
7470 2018-02-10 21:59:07 I try to help out where I can. 
I ignored your questioned. Duh.
You didn't answer as to the hypocrisy of comparing a rich doctor vs a rich televangelist as bad (doc) good (snake oil salesman)
Answer that.
7471 2018-02-10 21:59:01 Early reports coming in of additional Coalition airstrikes targeting pro #Assad forces near Khusham (unconfirmed presence of Iranian-backed militias) in #DeirEzzor #Syria - thus far unconfirmed, however, appear to be near Conoco Oil field
7472 2018-02-10 21:58:59 Oil changes are so expensive
7473 2018-02-10 21:58:39 Try coconut oil. It works.
7474 2018-02-10 21:58:26 Our dog has been fighting seasonal allergies.  We finally got an appt to see a Vet dermatologist New diet.  4lbs raw beef, 4eggs, sup pwdr & coconut oil day.  People already give me the side eye w/3 carts. Only the brave ask me how long till the next trip?
7475 2018-02-10 21:58:22 no recipe should have 3/4 cup of oil but honestly sichuan pepper is numbness and nothing else
7476 2018-02-10 21:58:20 United Snake Oil Amerika. Onları ve Avrupa'yı onların silahı ile vurmalı. Yangın yerine döndürülmeli aq.
7477 2018-02-10 21:58:13 When ever I cover myself in coconut oil I think of this lol
7478 2018-02-10 21:58:05 Dear Pamela, at least you know that Iran has been occupied by criminals and thieves who are less than 500 thousand with all their supporters,MSN cover them to be legitimate by oil money. They can't do shit with their garbage broken old Russian toys, @IsraeliPM must not go to trap
7479 2018-02-10 21:57:55 Is he a @djonesvi liberal?
7480 2018-02-10 21:57:37 You can put it in this vegetable oil bottle you gave me now I know what I need to do to make y'all periods Grow.

7484 2018-02-10 21:57:18 What is with the oil/gas/coal industry, invest into your workers country and future, retrain your workers for green energy, invest into it and think forward!!!!! I know why they won't is simply it will cost them profits in the short term but in the long term it will be a big Win!
7485 2018-02-10 21:56:48 Gettin my oil changed and this nigga recommending all kinda trash to me and I’m gettin it all cause this my moms card not mines lmaoo
7486 2018-02-10 21:56:39 I couldn't live without coconut oil . Literally use it on everything . Even my mascara lol
7487 2018-02-10 21:56:39 The guy that just okayed an oil pipeline through British Columbia? Sorry to curb your enthusiasm.
7488 2018-02-10 21:56:36 流石にバゼル２頭に双剣で来て速効で２乙する奴居たから初めてキック機能使ったわ
7489 2018-02-10 21:56:29 That's good, we'll take our oil with us & you'll have to buy it instead of just taking it.
7490 2018-02-10 21:56:14 20% off Honu oil cartridges and we even have a couple flavored cartridges!
7491 2018-02-10 21:56:06 
7492 2018-02-10 21:55:50 --most of it is mines and oil."
7493 2018-02-10 21:55:48 I sure know that I would rather try CBD oil if I have to have joint replacement surgery, rather than being sick from side effects of Dilaudid. Don’t even get me started on how awful the side effects of Vicodin are. Marijuana is not a gateway drug. All the studies show this.
7494 2018-02-10 21:55:47 Rosemary - Valentine 20% OFF - Jasmine Perfume Oil #thecuring #Aromatherapy
7495 2018-02-10 21:55:44 With an oil well full of oil money, and a nation bankrolling that club's steamrollering of an otherwise combative league, Manchester City are an unstoppable behomoth.
7496 2018-02-10 21:55:43 My oil stocks do for sure
7497 2018-02-10 21:55:10 Doin laundry stresses me out, dont know why, it just does. So I go outside and take a big rip of my oil pen, completely forgetting I work in an hour lol... 
7498 2018-02-10 21:55:09 "DO NOT play TRY NOT TO LAUGH, it's so HARD YOU WILL DIE TRYING!"

7499 2018-02-10 21:54:55 Lime Juice and Olive Oil is the worlds best salad dressing 
7500 2018-02-10 21:54:35 Then I guess Friedman and the boys are correct. The global 1% should profits from Venezuela oil? Doesn’t matter the despot as long as he is ours. Apparently Madura isn’t. Would love to hear your thoughts.
7501 2018-02-10 21:54:34 extra virgin olive oil is a good moisturizer too .
7502 2018-02-10 21:54:12 Then apply coconut oil afterwards?
7503 2018-02-10 21:54:12 Kfb @bextyrrell91
7504 2018-02-10 21:54:11 No but there is good evidence that fish oil (LAX101) does not help. Overall it seems an unfruitful line of enquiry
7505 2018-02-10 21:54:09 Had a great bath tonight! @LOCCITANE_UK Ultra Rich Foaming Bath, Relaxing Bath Salts & Comforting Cream with @EsteeLauder Youth Dew Bath Oil & Youth Dew Body Lotion - music: @abbatalk Super Trouper & The Visitors deluxe editions 
7506 2018-02-10 21:54:05 Weigh out four pinches of olive oil and take off heat.
7507 2018-02-10 21:53:59 make sure you use the coconut oil when your hair is wet  then dry it.. i mostly mix the aloe gel with  coconut oil but it smells terrible
7508 2018-02-10 21:53:51 Esta buenísimo para posicionarse, por lo que recién leí, en oil and gas companies! Mucho mejor que comprar $ts  (que ayer compré again)
7509 2018-02-10 21:53:48 Expect MORE storms, more damage, thanks to Trump & this corrupt GOP abolishing Consumer Protections for human beings, in favor of Oil co's., while they lavish Corp's in taxpayer cash.=ADDING TRILLIONS TO OUR DEBT, THAT THEY'LL TAKE FROM OUR SOCIAL SECURITY!
7510 2018-02-10 21:53:46 The only race I care about today is the Lucas Oil Winternationals finale tonight at East Bay Raceway. Dirt racing is the only good racing.
7511 2018-02-10 21:53:39 Dirty Canadian oil is only profitable when the price is high. How can the price of oil increase with plentiful supply around the world, and renewable energy already cheaper than fossils. Hopefully you know international investments are now higher in renewables than in fossils.
7512 2018-02-10 21:53:37 Bullshit! How are the world’s stock markets doing, Mr Wizard!? How about the drop in oil prices? Unemployment is low because of Obama. Wages remain stagnant relative to CPI and inflation. Translation: the dollars buy less! Get fucking real! Lower taxes don’t mean a thing!
7513 2018-02-10 21:53:35 But it's was OK for Wagner and some SAA forces to try to take the oil fields. Just they weren't gonna get Russian support
7514 2018-02-10 21:53:32 Take the wand and draw  circle around a head then cut or copy ,then pull up duck pic and click below duck and release or space bar and there u have a oil head at ducks feet lol takes practice tho
7515 2018-02-10 21:53:04 Yo tan gas oil y vos tan naftera

7520 2018-02-10 21:52:30 In my view US policy in the ME is 100% about keeping oil priced in $USD and to that we do what KSA needs us to do.
7521 2018-02-10 21:52:13 1k to replace my brakes, oil and indoor cabin air filter by my dealer.  Or 350 to do the heavy shit myself. I'm going with option 2 right now.
7522 2018-02-10 21:52:11 I appreciate that lol I was asking for whats good for your skin tho since ppl saying coconut oil aint it

7524 2018-02-10 21:51:47 Try Clove oil— wishing you well!
7525 2018-02-10 21:51:46 @ggreenwald Rubio's 'suggestion' about Venezuela is unadulterated neo-conservatism, just without the oil. Oh, wait.
7526 2018-02-10 21:51:39 これから何をしよう…
7527 2018-02-10 21:51:36 I wonder if the oil helps with heat in any way because damn
7528 2018-02-10 21:51:35  this is slightly preferable to the typical lettuce suggestion of "pour over half a pint of oil and top with deep-fried bacon bits and croutons". In my experience this is not the usual reason people eat lettuce
7529 2018-02-10 21:51:34 "Extra Virgin Olive Oil" sounds all 'mysterious' and 'healthy', but unless it's part of the $40 a bottle crowd, it's likely deodorized oil pressed from rotten olives or another type entirely, with a small amount of actual E.V.O.O. added in. Also likely the olives aren't Italian.

7535 2018-02-10 21:51:00 I follow him every time and he is always is on my unfollow list. So I just stop follow after 4 or 5 times. All follow back but him.
7536 2018-02-10 21:50:52 Trader Joe’s Tea Tree Oil face wash. Girl, it was the final thing that really kicked it to the curb for me.
7537 2018-02-10 21:50:51 I don't think McLellan will be fired, but lets pretend he will be, would Oil fans welcome back MacT behind the bench? I know his GM stint was poor but he was a decent coach for a long time. Just curious.
7538 2018-02-10 21:50:20 Yeeeheeess, whut else?
Nothing better to expect by dudes fucked in the ass by the oil industry.
7539 2018-02-10 21:49:57 Yup. Short term profit. What’s left of the last oil boom in your province? You didn’t foolishly spent it all away buying bigger pickups did you? ;-)
7540 2018-02-10 21:49:50 Yevgeny Prigozhin owns Wagner, he must have made a deal with Syria to get profits from the oil fields the SDF were controlling
7541 2018-02-10 21:49:49 You can file anyone who preaches that they've mastered "real world risk" in the same category as those who throw "Big Data" or "blockchain" at a problem and hope it sticks. They're trying to sell you snake oil because they know you don't understand the math.
7542 2018-02-10 21:49:42 This aged well.

7544 2018-02-10 21:49:20 Ugh, THAT. Do you know what the word "aioli" means? "Garlic and oil". But "aioli" sounds good, sounds 'mysterious' to laymen. Way better than "mayonnaise" which everyone thinks of as full of fat and bad for your health. It's a marketing scam, in other words. Same with olive oil.
7545 2018-02-10 21:49:08 tea tree oil is my lord and saviour
7546 2018-02-10 21:49:08 so much snake oil in the music realm...

7548 2018-02-10 21:48:53 It's not legal in my state where I live in th US.  I'm severely allergic to narcotics & have coded 3 times just in the last 1 1/2 yrs. I would just like to try the oil. I was dx 2010 and stopped disease-modifying treatment a year ago. I'm limited to what I can use JCV+
7549 2018-02-10 21:48:47 It was my pleasure! We learned all about methods to clean up oil spills and got a little messy in the process. Future scientists in the making! 

Big thank you to Cville Comm-UNI-ty for hosting the table!
7550 2018-02-10 21:48:22 Duke will get him, Coach K is the best snake oil salesman in college basketball.
7551 2018-02-10 21:48:18 Baby oil isn't terrible, but a water based lube is always best. Just keep the flavored stuff away from girl parts, that's a BAD place for sugar.
7552 2018-02-10 21:47:42 Share the facts of the inevitable oil spill and how Alberta won't help with that.
7553 2018-02-10 21:47:42 Suncor seems to fix their objective trying to increase the quantity and quality of oil sands, while trying to be friendly to the environment. GreenPeace wants to protect the ecosystem, saying tar sand can destroy the ecosystem. #TarSands #Lesson5
7554 2018-02-10 21:47:39 I have solar panels on my roof.  I want energy to be clean as possible and reliable as possible.  Wind power needs oil, turbines leak, kills animals,vibrations sent thru ground, causes seizures, are ugly all over our land.  Solar not as reliable.  Sorry for rudeness of others

7559 2018-02-10 21:46:40 i was just reminded of an oil painting we did of a golden eagle waaaaaay back when we were a kid and frankly i have no idea how the fuck we did that. i remember it was really good.

#حياتك7
7561 2018-02-10 21:46:29 So, to recap: Alberta oil is quickly doomed if a pipeline isn’t built. Anyhow soon doomed as cheaper international oil replaces it, or eventually doomed, as the whole world is converting out of fossils. Sounds like cancer: Do you want a slow painful death or a quick one?
7562 2018-02-10 21:46:24 Only the snake oil salesman can give us IMPRACTICALLY HUGE WALLS BUILT FOR RACISM!
7563 2018-02-10 21:46:11 Basically AMERICAN STOCK MARKET ALL THE FORTUNE 500 AMERICAN BASED STOCK COMPANIES INCLUDING OIL ARE WORTHLESS WHEN U BOUGHT IT THEY NEW IT I HAVE BEEN DOING A OVER TEN YR TOTAL TAKE AND BREAK DOWN OF NOT ONLY THE COMPANIES BUT ALOT OF TOP CEO EXECUTIVES ALL LIARS
7564 2018-02-10 21:46:07 The US' track record for interference doesn't inspire any hands-off confidence.  Just because there's "NEVER' been, does not by any means guarantee it'll stay that way. 
Because it won't.  Two words:
OIL.
RESERVES.
7565 2018-02-10 21:46:04 They've got enough oil
7566 2018-02-10 21:46:02 DUMP'EM IN DA OCEAN NEXT TA DA OIL RIGZ HE APPROVED ON OUR BEAUTIFUL SHOREZ...

7571 2018-02-10 21:45:43 There was a bit in the paper last week that Macdonald's French Fries have a cure for baldness. It is something to do with the oil they are fried in. I will have to try some. 
7572 2018-02-10 21:45:36 I got invited to a Brown party this weekend. Little do they know I plan on spending the night syphoning their youthful Ivy League energy. I’m gunna walk out of there with a 5% higher IQ, engaged to Emma Watson and heir to an oil dynasty
7573 2018-02-10 21:45:31 Agree. Let's obsolete big oil and clean up planet. 

No need to buy into absurd lies about oil being a fossil fuel or man's CO2 causing GW - it's a $100T tax scam and OWG enslavement plan. Al gump is evil.
7574 2018-02-10 21:45:15 In this discussion there is a confusion between local regulations to protect the people around oil/gas extraction from LOCAL pollutants and regulations that effect CO2 emissions, which effect EVERYBODY on the planet. Few of the states listed above have CLIMATE regulations./1
7575 2018-02-10 21:45:07 A bot must combine sugar, water, and salt.
A bot must rub your hands with cooking oil.
A bot must not combine scents.
7576 2018-02-10 21:45:07 Free tags for life hands down. OIL tags take 15-20 years to draw and are insanely expensive if bought at auction. Big buck is great, but it’s just ONE. Don’t care about the product, but acres would be number two. Still, free tags for life wins.

7582 2018-02-10 21:44:14 While Christina was tanning with canola oil, hunching Redman and wearing magnetic nose rings, Britney was living her best blonde life, shooting videos on Mars and whatnot. She’s valid.
7583 2018-02-10 21:44:09 Not true. The warrants (4 of them) were authorized by the FISA courts who do not just accept the "word" of the presenter. You're being sold a bill of goods by a snake oil salesman and his band of idiots.
7584 2018-02-10 21:44:05 Cutting the EPA .. opening up national parks to Oil & Gas companies...opening the Artic up as well ..lowering corporate responsibility for pollution.. look at Puerto Rico it's still suffering..Flint Michigan still has NO clean water.. telling Coal towns he'll open mines...etc etc
7585 2018-02-10 21:43:50 Cal has an oil refinery and oil out of their western part of the state. If they block gasoline or any other oil product pipeline it will drive gasoline prices to excessive levels
7586 2018-02-10 21:43:48 Russia wants Syrian  Mediterranean Ports oil and gas contracts weapons sales and huge construction projects for rebuilding if Russia wanted peace the war would have been over a long time ago
7587 2018-02-10 21:43:41 @realDonaldTrump has done nothing to prohibit the #FakeNews or networks broadcasting it, and instead chooses to merely excoriate what any half-witted guppy can see. Democrats advocate execution-style murders of police simply because, as everybody knows, there are some bad cops.
7588 2018-02-10 21:43:36 هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه
7589 2018-02-10 21:43:31 Read the dossier, we know the deal. Drill for oil 45 gets 19%
7590 2018-02-10 21:43:25 The U.S. has been at war for 223 years out of 249 years of existence. Oil is one excuse, but there will always be an excuse when financial interests outweigh human lives.
7591 2018-02-10 21:43:18 Marijuana arrests are encouraged by oil companies. Hemp, world's most useful plant, can fuel cars among a million other uses. They have always seen the hemp strain as a  a threat so they had it demonized. #Awkwardfacts
7592 2018-02-10 21:43:06 If you realize this human powered global warming scam is real?so sad!
Sure let Suncor rock. but my great grandkids are not going to have any of our million year old oil and gas left too enjoy.  There is a renewable hydrogen world happening. We need our NG to kickstart that.
7593 2018-02-10 21:42:49 I know I'm really late to the party but congratulations to @NatalieRacing for winning the POLE for the Lucas Oil 200 ARCA race at @DISupdates !!!
Now go get that Win Girl!
7594 2018-02-10 21:42:24 Lol ur see as ur praying fr less than one k,,ur funny  cmon test it jorh
7595 2018-02-10 21:41:57 6 bil. A bandaid. The walls. Major surgery. 
Done and done. We need a nothern border wall also. Bring our troops home. To hell with the oil.
7596 2018-02-10 21:41:41 The amount of olive oil I go through is absurd like I cook almost everything with it, I use it in body scrubs & hair masques, it’s my sole makeup remover, I use it for cuticles, as lip balm & moisturiser when I’m out of those things... Olive oil is my life and blood.
7597 2018-02-10 21:41:40 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
7598 2018-02-10 21:41:32 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
7599 2018-02-10 21:41:18 "You can see energy leading the way down".  Leading.  Not preceding, or concurrent.  Leading.  I asked you to explain the premise of leadership.  You replied with exasperation forcing you to stop discussion.  If you would like to explain why oil led, I'll read and consider.
7600 2018-02-10 21:41:18 I'm pretty sure oil companies are nowhere near the top of the capitalist money makers list anymore. Ironically enough liberals are the big American capitalists now. Tech companies like Google, Yahoo, Apple, Amazon make the oil companies look like mom and pop shops.
7601 2018-02-10 21:41:10 Engines have been fired for the Lucas Oil 200 @DISupdates #ARCARacing
7602 2018-02-10 21:40:59 Steaming with olbus oil helps dude
7603 2018-02-10 21:40:57 When you fit a new or overhauled engine don't you have to start them  with fuel selector off so they can burn off excess pooled oil/fuel in  the bottom?  This is a new engine I would suggest
7604 2018-02-10 21:40:54 That's a truly shortsighted view. Lately I've been thinking if we leave the oil in the ground and use other formed of energy we are doing our kids and generations to come a huge favor by saving this energy source just in case, for them.
7605 2018-02-10 21:40:45 Shorty for Edmonton after Rebels have all the momentum early in the second. Anders tries to clear puck, lands right on Oil Kings' stick.

Oil bubbles to the surface...  They are not to be drilling or fracking anything...  Humans go too far...  They are extremists...
7614 2018-02-10 21:39:41 #Edmonton oil kings score 1-0
7615 2018-02-10 21:39:39 Maybe olive OIL arose because it only used to exist here as a remedy for earache, oil taking precedence over olive.
7616 2018-02-10 21:39:38 With coconut oil tears from your third eye
7617 2018-02-10 21:39:31 To be fair this is the same section of the population that throughout history has been fooled by magic beans, snake oil , televangelists and Nigerian princes.
7618 2018-02-10 21:39:29 Blackened with seasoning, fried in a pan with coconut oil.  You can’t go wrong.  Como se dice en español, no sé, todavia estoy aprendiendo español.  Buena suerte!
7619 2018-02-10 21:39:26 ladies, Aloe vera  + coconut oil treats hair breakage.
7620 2018-02-10 21:39:21 Yes it was. I was more than shocked when I saw the feature. Like, Ice really had a member of SLAUGHTERHOUSE on his song!!!!

And the so-called "HipHop heads" who feel Vector  is the next best thing after oil didn't hype it up because it was Ice.

SMFH.

The memory hurts abeg 
7621 2018-02-10 21:39:21 Still wants a guy to rub baby oil on him Whist checking he's ugly enough to walk of the park without a sling shot feeding him steroids
7622 2018-02-10 21:39:05 jae about time and liegle matter is the mess who clean theta up us sell the soil to #firstnation ghee the oil company back but it under the sea to many times not late of yet but the further action on the premise is
7623 2018-02-10 21:39:00 Went to @PFChangs and asked what oil they cook with, because i'm allergic to palm oil. Manager told me they use wokoil, so no problem.
7624 2018-02-10 21:38:41 Do she got baby oil on her titties 
7625 2018-02-10 21:38:36 Definitely look at CBD oil. I hope you start to feel better soon x

7628 2018-02-10 21:38:04 I was told by my MD to try cannabis... which I did;first "vape";which is really smoke;which I couldn't tolerate;then oil....neither was "effective" and;I had to pay for it...only morphine works on my pain;been on it over 20yrs
7629 2018-02-10 21:37:39 any one watching the arca lucas oil 200 from Daytona @LugsPodcast
7630 2018-02-10 21:37:34 You'd think a hunter him would understand that we don't want oil companies poaching on our land
7631 2018-02-10 21:37:33 Unfortunately, no Nigerian business is actually founded, managed, and sustained by hard work and honesty. They're all vessels and conduits for looted oil money, you earlier talked about. Looted by people who seized power through barrels of guns, still paying on. #NotSustainable
7632 2018-02-10 21:37:29 Calling it a resin bear is a common mistake...

It's more properly referred to as the North American Acrylic Bear:
Ursus acer

Unlike the European Oil Bear, or the Anatolian Linseed Bear, the North American Acrylic Bear is water-soluble

:)
7633 2018-02-10 21:37:26 @rossi_george Words,  not even close to anything.  But I'm sure you actually believe in Human powered climate change.  And that oil is a renewable resource? huh?  Hydrogen IS!  I say,  print the money and get the future under way.
7634 2018-02-10 21:36:53 you know your @ risk from snake oil salesmen, if you buy 'Russia Hacked' but don't wonder why tangible solutions like 'hand counted paper ballots' are never, not rarely, but never discussed.
7635 2018-02-10 21:36:38 All for eastern Canada & bitumen dirty oil pipes for BC.
7636 2018-02-10 21:36:37 the only fish I've ever cooked is tuna, I think. If you can find some good tuna that's not too expensive you really should try it, you basically just throw it in the frying pan without oil or anything and let it cook for a little while. And it's delicious.
7637 2018-02-10 21:36:09 Energy equity was the hardest hit. It led oil. There wasn't one cause this week. I said multiple selling pressured. Inflation was the catalyst last Friday until about noon. After that it was a cascade. This week it was cl. Look at major data releases & SPX/CL movement. It's clear
7638 2018-02-10 21:35:40 Usually Kroger is my other store (Aldi is right by my house), but I got my oil changed near this place today. It’s added about 2 hours to my day! Never again!
7639 2018-02-10 21:35:28 try grandmaa's secret hair oil
7640 2018-02-10 21:35:14 I did! It needs an oil change though, way to leave it in crummy condition.
7641 2018-02-10 21:35:09 is that oil in the can or compressed air?
7642 2018-02-10 21:34:58 Worse than a snake oil salesman.
7643 2018-02-10 21:34:43 And Venezuela has a huge amount of oil.
Socialism is hopeless.
7644 2018-02-10 21:34:40 Yes, you are right but even at that the North will still not let go willingly. This is so because Lagos ports, taxes and other major earnings that constitute the bulk of Nigeria's revenue after oil still comes mainly from the Yorùbáland in Western Nigeria.
7645 2018-02-10 21:34:38 Lol BUT THEY ARENT THE RUSSIAN / CHINESE ARE LOOKING AT AMERICA LIKE THERE CRAZY CHILDISH CAUSE ITS EMBARRASSING THAT NO 1 WAS REALLY PAYING ATTENTION WITH ALL THE DRUG ELECTRONICS & ALCOHOL WARS LET ALONE THE OIL/ LAND WARS
7646 2018-02-10 21:34:36 It really does, it is why I had to create a body oil for men because they were putting the oil all over their bodies, so coming soon Oak St. Hydrating Body Oil, smells sooo good, just how a man should smell

7649 2018-02-10 21:34:26 I used tea tree oil in my diffuser to sleep often & now the slightest wiff of it makes me sleepy
7650 2018-02-10 21:34:16 The weed is infused in the bath bombs, CBD oil I believe  for muscle & body relaxation.
7651 2018-02-10 21:34:09 What do you do the other days? Call Canadians deniers and accuse northern oil workers a high rape risk. You’re just not that smart
7652 2018-02-10 21:34:08 @SecretaryZinke Please don't sell Oregon's oil against our wishes! This is our land and we want to protect it! Surely a hunter like you understands that.
7653 2018-02-10 21:34:07 Would you feel better if she was sucking up to Little Oil? How about Medium Pipeline? What are you thoughts on her support for Domestic Petrochemicals? Do you like the AB carbon tax? How about carbon levy/OBAs on oil sands emissions? Oops...is this becoming too complex for you?
7654 2018-02-10 21:34:07 Também estou a usar dessa marca e comecei a usar tea tree oil, melhorou imenso, também comecei a usar argila branca e vermelha e está a melhorar mt mt mt mais

7656 2018-02-10 21:33:48 Let the games begin! I'll bring the oil.
7657 2018-02-10 21:33:04 Same here Layne, WD40 and a bottle of 10/40 motorcycle oil...  #MovigosPastaNight
7658 2018-02-10 21:32:32 Hmmm to diversify, yet he is the minister of petroleum. If oil is not still HIGHLY CONSIDERED WHY did he not be the minister of agric
7659 2018-02-10 21:32:27 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
7660 2018-02-10 21:32:26 Honestly hope Newcastle get the big buy-out they need. Not even an oil billionaire, just someone who genuinely gives a fuck.
7661 2018-02-10 21:32:16 You ain’t said nothing slick to a can of oil
7662 2018-02-10 21:32:16 Not me.. oil and sludge
7663 2018-02-10 21:32:11 I also have hydrating body oil for men and women too and other body things as well.
7664 2018-02-10 21:31:51 Coconut oil is the GOAT! I wash my face with it, moisturize my face with it, use it as makeup remover, body lotion, cooking oil, butter substitute and prob other stuff I’m forgetting lol.
I get the Virgin, Unrefined, Cold Pressed kind.
7665 2018-02-10 21:31:38 @AshleyEmmax amazing show lovely should definitely do an oil special on babestasion sometime x
7666 2018-02-10 21:31:24 We chilling & listening to music next thing my G random speaks up

"the way wey Arsenal dey go down eh, dem go discover crude oil"

Like whaaaat??!! 
7667 2018-02-10 21:31:20 Interesting when we think about it - firstly why are we the only poor indebted oil producing nation (where did it all go?) and secondly just think - if a billion $ bills would stretch almost 4 times round the world, visualising a trillion £ would need space travel to demonstrate.
7668 2018-02-10 21:31:11 Peppermint essential oil really does deter mice... I put some under the sink and near a few vents and haven’t seen them since. My house may smell like candy land but at least I don’t have to take the mice down to the woods in Tupperware anymore
7669 2018-02-10 21:30:53 I feel so productive i caught a toaster on fire and changed my oil it’s a good day
7670 2018-02-10 21:30:28 I will vote, just NOT for Trump who destroyed land in a National Park by allowing Gas and Oil to buy that land and mine it for private profit.

7673 2018-02-10 21:29:49 There is truth somewhere beneath all the political theater. Will we ever know it?
7674 2018-02-10 21:29:38 You can't claim two opposing antecedents.  Oil shows demand on forward looking inflation, not weakness.  At best, we see conflation of events (oil selling on supply fears, while inflation fears spur FANG selling).  At the end, oil capitulates, while FANGS rebound. No elasticity.
7675 2018-02-10 21:29:17 Gas volatilizes too quickly on hot coals. 

Try motor oil or old tires.
7676 2018-02-10 21:29:17 Why would we poison Burrard Inlet? If you are ferries have spilled more fuel than oil tankers! Ban the ferries.
7677 2018-02-10 21:29:17 I have like three dimples on my face. And I’ve so many red acne scars right now I try to heal them with oil but I think it clogs my pores. so if anyone knows something that helps me with acne scars but doesn’t clog up my pores any suggestions?
7678 2018-02-10 21:28:59 @Plowboys_At_CCB Love the beer from Cedar Creek but just had the worst food I've had in a decade. Gumbo tastes like burnt motor oil served over gravel.
7679 2018-02-10 21:28:59 Oh mine is just horrible :( that’s probably why. Coconut oil right after you make the changes and it helps.
7680 2018-02-10 21:28:42 Richard must be busy bottling oil this weekend
7681 2018-02-10 21:28:13 If you pay a mechanic for an oil change, he can't decide you don't need one and keep the money.
7682 2018-02-10 21:28:11 And we are making huge progress. Proof that it’s a transition in that there are people protesting against oil in oil make kayaks! How ridiculous?
7683 2018-02-10 21:28:09 I’m sold. Need to buy coconut oil for hair hair to anyways. DOING IT AGAIN lol
7684 2018-02-10 21:28:05 Because we want to dig ourselves deeper into this oil well. I agree.
7685 2018-02-10 21:28:04 وربي شكيت ان معاهم جوال
7686 2018-02-10 21:28:00 This article is stupid AF. The next rockets are going to be using a methane-hydrogen reaction. The only exhause will be co2 and h2O sooo, dont compare something tremendous for human advancement to something that is impactful to the environment like burning oil. TYVM

Apparently one dead kid is no big deal to them.
7690 2018-02-10 21:27:34 Why are oil plugs so inconsistent gOdDaMnItTtTTtt
7691 2018-02-10 21:27:33 I just put my I hate oil on water shirt on to sleep in I'm gonna have a great sleep
7692 2018-02-10 21:27:32 Yes, it's a spread that uses an oil emulsion, but that's it.
7693 2018-02-10 21:27:07 You're saying oil pulled down the market?  Why did the market follow XOM, explain.  FANG sold off on inflation worries, to which you agree.  So the fact they track SPX/DOW, shows correlation, and causation.  Oil did not sell off on inflation fears.  So which is it?
7694 2018-02-10 21:27:07 Sorry I haven’t been over in a while mom....me and the boys at fast lane oil change have formed a intramural softball team. Pictures are this Saturday if you want to buy a package.
7695 2018-02-10 21:27:02 Such words falls on deaf hears especially people like Buhari who is obsessed with oil, that's the only reason his there. To him even if its only one drop of oil he will still not think outside oil.

They also let thousands of terrorists transit through Turkey, as well as import truck from Texas and Singapore bound for Raqqa. Wounded ISIS go to Turkey.

7724 2018-02-10 21:21:58 The appearance that he was used to capture Intel on others within his orbit is strong and that he was not primary target.

7727 2018-02-10 21:21:42 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
7728 2018-02-10 21:21:38 In fact, the one exception, was D3, where oil tried to fill the gap down to SPX/DOW, but tech resisted, and closed negative.  End result?  Tech won the decision candle, and forced the break-down.

7730 2018-02-10 21:21:31 There has arrived absolutely wild lady with the oil engine and a l'anglaise and tout le tremblement team in the evening.
7731 2018-02-10 21:21:18 I hope she will be there when matatus heading to Nairobi from Kitui County will be stopped just after Kithimani and burnt the same way!
7732 2018-02-10 21:21:14 Nobody...loyal to the Oil....but be interesting to see how "real" the Jets are...

7735 2018-02-10 21:20:46 Peep your cute oil accent
7736 2018-02-10 21:20:41 I really enjoy going to Ferry Plaza and cosplaying as someone who can afford all the fancy olive oil I'm sampling – bij Ferry Plaza Farmers Market
7737 2018-02-10 21:20:28 Every time I hear Newsom speak, I feel like I need to wipe the oil off of my hands.  It's the same impression I got with Clinton (whom I voted for).  His attempts to distort the facts in attacking Villaraigosa are emblematic of his approach to public service: give sound bites...
7738 2018-02-10 21:20:25 It's already happening and construction underway. Once finished and US connects both oil basins, then the real exporting starts.
US will outproduce the OPEC no doubt if fracking viable pricewise. New World Order! ;)
7739 2018-02-10 21:20:16 And I need some more castor oil
7740 2018-02-10 21:20:14 NO, the world WOULDN'T. 
It's the OIL, so stop with the lying. You're not fooling all of us out here, because we know you don't give two flying fekks about the people.  You want the OIL RESERVES.
7741 2018-02-10 21:20:10 The later sent them for oil prospective in maiduguri
7742 2018-02-10 21:19:56 My mom and I are like water and oil. 

She wants power and control. 

I want equity and collaboration. 

As a child I used to pray that I would be nothing like her as an adult which is funny now because there was no chance of me being like her at all.
7743 2018-02-10 21:19:55 so in like four weeks I'm going to give myself a hot oil treatment and a deep conditioning masque
7744 2018-02-10 21:19:53 Oil and gas to be priced in Yuan and Roubles, maybe balanced by their stack
7745 2018-02-10 21:19:42 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.

7750 2018-02-10 21:18:58 So the virgin olive oil won't be so virgin after?
7751 2018-02-10 21:18:34 "names rig, well that's what everyone calls me, what brings you out all the way to one of the DOATECH's oil rigs?"
7752 2018-02-10 21:18:25 But we are not there yet...that is the problem.  Can electric vehicals go 300 km,s now......if you dont use the heater or air conditioner?   As well, much of this exported oil is going to places where they are currently using coal.  Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels.
7753 2018-02-10 21:18:25 I pray so. But, with Dangote in my backyard, not sure I would have any reason to patronise the oil traders again. Besides, the birth of Dangote Refinery could give rise to more local traders who would be dragging SSA market with those earlier mentioned.
7754 2018-02-10 21:18:25 Low intensity conflict in Western Syria, between multiple parties, can  be perpetuated nearly forever. Invest accordingly. Germany will happily sell heavy armaments to the Turks, USRUK will provide the latest in  ATGMs to Kurdish girl scouts, Oil Co's gamble for pipeline wins.
7755 2018-02-10 21:18:20 Oh dear I suppose you’ve tried steam & olbas oil?
7756 2018-02-10 21:18:00 Well so far your government has driven a wedge between BC and Alberta and allowed Quebec to just say no to the Energy East pipeline, all while promoting the oil industry.
Libs govern exactly like Cons did.

It works well.
7768 2018-02-10 21:17:02 Norwegians don’t mind to pay 35% duty and excise on articles bought in Sweden and other EU countries.

When reporting economic woes, anything expect Brexit is mentioned as a cause (last one North Sea oil!).

7778 2018-02-10 21:15:53 Aside from our Enbridge Line 67 upgrade on Presidential approval effectively immediately, which adds a potential 350kbpd to the US market, we have no new pipeline takeaway capacity for a few years;  how do you see us effecting oil balance for 2018?
7779 2018-02-10 21:15:49 I am intrigued, and may need to test. I mean, it's oil, it should work...
7780 2018-02-10 21:15:43 This dealership just taxed me for a semi synthetic oil change.... Smh

7783 2018-02-10 21:15:25 How do you conclude it led?   No way.  1:1 correlation to QQQ, to the day.  If oil was leading, the drop would correlate to oil, XEG, not QQQ.  Oil was far less elastic to SPX/DOW, than was tech.

7789 2018-02-10 21:14:58 RE: Climate change. Delaying the Kinder Morgan Pipeline increases carbon emissions as our "clean" oil ,that could reach foreign markets, is replaced by oil from jurisdictions with little environmental awareness, for example some countries do not worry or even monitor oil spills.
7790 2018-02-10 21:14:47 Oh shut the fuck up. We don't need more oil production we need fusion power or every roof in the USA covered with Mr Musk's solar roof shingles.
7791 2018-02-10 21:14:36 peeps still tryna stop the kinder morgan, and its like... yes we need to be conscious of the environment but also... Alberta still needs that oil business to function as a province... so pls chill

7814 2018-02-10 21:10:12 Outcome is other energy nations increase supply while Canada and Canadians suffer. Why not focus on exporting our LNG to displace coal or our highly regulated oil to displace unregulated oil. All of this would be a positive but instead focus on tax.
7815 2018-02-10 21:10:02 Everybody want a foreign car til they hit you with that $100 oil change that your favorite uncle can’t even do

7846 2018-02-10 21:04:36 I love Israel. But women are free in Syria.  They aren’t in Saudi Arabia & Turkey. Be careful because oil pipelines routeports run through Syria. To Europe.  This push for regime change is over oil pipelines. Don’t be fooled.

7856 2018-02-10 21:03:58 Sure you can, on one commodity, if an influential variable sends a strong enough signal.  The wash-out was not based upon oil dynamics, but general mkt dynamics, based upon inflation fears, which, if reasoned out, should signal a buy in oil, not a sell, if forward looking.

7863 2018-02-10 21:03:06 Its very old. Its not the CIA alone but with MI6 it planned and executed the operation. Because mosaddeg has nationalized the oil industry there as apposed to US who bats for privatization for his own companies. Later BP and texas oil has did as they wanted.

7867 2018-02-10 21:02:56 Yep. Gold-Yuan, Petro-Yuan. Not just gold but oil as well. China don’t like the USD anymore
7868 2018-02-10 21:02:54 It's amazing. Heating days above avg and Nat gas as low as US$ 2.7 MMBTU. Big oil should be canonized.
7869 2018-02-10 21:02:53 They look forward to the day when iDcotland can set the price of oil.  they are barking mad.
7870 2018-02-10 21:02:45 I bought a tropical plant, put frangipani essential oil in my diffuser, and am playing Spanish guitar music. Trying hard to ignore that there is yet. another. snowstorm. happening. outside. 
7871 2018-02-10 21:02:41 I heard coconut oil does the trick. Is that incorrect? Asking for a friend.

7875 2018-02-10 21:01:54 Sa'ad al Hadithi said the federal government expects oil companies who struck deals with KRG without Baghdad consent to strike new deals directly with federal gov
7876 2018-02-10 21:01:49 it is the equivalent of a natural oil spill.  the good companies are just cleaning it up. otherwise it will slowly evaporate and leak into the watershed.
7877 2018-02-10 21:01:00 Christy Clark is an Unconstitutionalist! And she's still representing those who elected her, Alberta oil companies. Still no respect for BC citizens. #bcpoli
7878 2018-02-10 21:00:46 hot oil treatment, ftw...

Allegedly..


7879 2018-02-10 21:00:44 Imo witch hazel doesn't clear up my skin BUT it does clean off the oil and dirt and stuff and having a clean face does make me touch it less, which then makes me break out less
7880 2018-02-10 21:00:43 Well, you can't claim to be rich in Kwale if you are not in system and have a life time contract with all this oil firm around
7881 2018-02-10 21:00:31 Cacio e pepe, and then a huge bowl of shredded radicchio with olive oil and salt. I feel terribly continental.
7882 2018-02-10 21:00:17 @amysmakeupbox only found you today and I’ve already ordered the bondi sands tanning oil and the iconic london highlighteryou’re already stepping up my game
7883 2018-02-10 21:00:13 can do an oil change, change tires, change spark plugs, change brakes but cannot change pcv valves
7884 2018-02-10 21:00:11 I follow back with the speed of . Even @usainbolt is envious of my speed. Follow @officialncdmb for updates on life changing opportunities like job opportunities, research grants, Single digit interest rate loans for businesses in the Oil and Gas Industry. Thanks me later.
7885 2018-02-10 20:59:56 I came prepared for my oil changed
7886 2018-02-10 20:59:50 “We could’ve said shit about you but we didn’t” bitch I pay my own fuckin bills, I’ve been fuckin my nigga and MY NIGGA ONLY for the last 6 years, my pussy smells of coconut oil & Shea butter, I have a college degree and planning to go for more, my ass is fat, my hair real
7887 2018-02-10 20:59:30 My sense (not an expert) is that the RRs do okay w landbridge intermodal, UPS/mail, coal, grain, oil, & autos in unit trains. Why bother w little stuff even if it is profitable?
7888 2018-02-10 20:59:22 @FRAM_Filters Your oil filters are carp.I'm telling everyone. Also, have been for awhile now.
7889 2018-02-10 20:59:18 Snake oil farming.  Virgin.  Cold pressed.
7890 2018-02-10 20:59:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i hate you say the fuck love josh dylan is tess?
7891 2018-02-10 20:59:01 I honestly think Corbyn thinks it is a good thing because it will increase demands for unions, after the Tories gut employment protections. The man is a snake oil salesman.
7892 2018-02-10 20:58:58 Like any of really believed that Bray, Matt Hardy or Apollo Crews were going to win. If you do, I got swampland property in North Dakota I would love to sell you that is sitting on an oil field!
7893 2018-02-10 20:58:54 1-use old trusty metal pan
2-use good quantity of oil
3-heat it well
4-move around the corns until all covered in oil
5-enjoy
7894 2018-02-10 20:58:52 When I do hot oil treatments it stays moisturized for a couple days
7895 2018-02-10 20:58:50 These ones were similar to my usual, cumin/salt/olive oil/roast garlic paste/lemon
7896 2018-02-10 20:58:40 My first time getting my oil changed for my car and it’s 5 months past due #adulting
7897 2018-02-10 20:58:37 Neither. Obama said he couldn't do it. Courts concur. Trump put it back where it belongs and forced Congress to deal with it.
7898 2018-02-10 20:58:34 Depends if using crude oil or not
7899 2018-02-10 20:58:23 Or an oil slick like in R.C. Pro Am.
7900 2018-02-10 20:57:58 The US arms & support dictators when it is in their interest. Saddam was armed to the teeth by the US & given blessing to wage war on Iran. Were there any outrage at that time? Nope! Controlling Oil is imperative to US hegemony hence millions of people have been slaughtered
7901 2018-02-10 20:57:52 Like shea butter and coconut oil 
7902 2018-02-10 20:57:21 Why are you asking me these questions? So odd. Everyone has products made from oil. So are you saying we cannot oppose pipelines if we use these products? How silly. We can say our opinions. To date we don't live in Russia.
7903 2018-02-10 20:57:14 There is one oil pipeline between China and North Korea. It's called the Dandong-Sinuiju pipeline . 90% of North Korea's oil flows through it. We should send in special forces to take it out. That will put Kim on his knees.
7904 2018-02-10 20:57:11 Need a big win from the Oil tonight over the Sharks #Flames
7905 2018-02-10 20:57:10 Yep. My question also. My dilemma: I jumped into the market in July. I went with oil. I converted to cash before this pullback and used it to short. Now what?
7906 2018-02-10 20:57:01 Stop listening to the mislead. The previous administrations starting with oil tycoon Bushes ending with Obama And Hillary have failed to subvert our country. Stop helping them.

7909 2018-02-10 20:56:49 Well.... it’s quite boring I changed the oil and rotated the tires on my truck in my 50 ft backyard garage and I guess watch sports
7910 2018-02-10 20:56:36 Olive Oil hun
7911 2018-02-10 20:56:35 That's super cute
7912 2018-02-10 20:56:29 New pipelines being built and better distribution will come to play in near future. Will aid exports and then see how the spread develops.
My bet could be near parity with Brent once channels are in place.
Trump also loves oil+coal as base for economy.
7913 2018-02-10 20:56:25 Bud coated in hash oil and then rolled in kief
7914 2018-02-10 20:56:21 If you add coconut oil to your Kale it makes it easier to scrape into the trash.
7915 2018-02-10 20:56:21 mayweather dropping 25k on oil changes while it takes my broke ass years to finance a 25k whip. 
7916 2018-02-10 20:56:13 not using tea tree oil anymore that shit burned my skin
7917 2018-02-10 20:56:05 Right after election. Was a card Obama held. He knew would be challenged in courts thus keeping it as an issue in 16 again. Pretty cagey
7918 2018-02-10 20:55:56 The largest oil reserve on the planet is a veritable magnet for the oil potentates, even tho its quality is below par.  Thank you G.G. Your voice, albeit diluted in a sea of opposing tyranny, is a beacon of light to those who would challenge the status quo.
7919 2018-02-10 20:55:22 Getting my oil changed and a 7 year old boy asked me if he could hold my hand.  Shooters shoot
7920 2018-02-10 20:55:14 Are you absolutely certain that nothing you own or use was produced/delivered with AB oil?
What about the source of your province's equalization payments?
I'll guarantee AB oil is part of your life.
7921 2018-02-10 20:55:13 I thought Ronald Reagan was the worst president in history with his trickledown and union-busting; then came Bush with his oil war/WMD lies/Cheney profiteering; then came Trump. You're right. Trump is the worst, and I used to think Buchanan was the worst - then came these three.
7922 2018-02-10 20:55:13 Aren’t some essential oils antibacterial, etc, like tea tree oil?
7923 2018-02-10 20:55:00 #China is a huge exporter and similarly largest importer of oil, so, most of imports/exports would traverse through Gwadar Port. 

Maximum planned capacity of #Chabahar is 10-12 million tons per annum, and that of #Gwadar is 300 to 400 million tons

Stop #daydreaming.

7924 2018-02-10 20:55:00 Session going on about pain pills is making me mad. The gov spent all that time guarding them poppies fields in Afghanistan and shipping opium to US in army planes for them Rothschild. No say take an aspirin. Just makes me so mad. So hope CBD oil helps my back pain.
7925 2018-02-10 20:54:57 you know when you’re about to go on holiday when you’ve got olive oil in ya ears
7926 2018-02-10 20:54:56 Not right now. The thing is, we have energy without fossil fuels. The Tech is there, but there’s still a ton of money left to be made off Nat Gas, Oil, and Coal, so they won’t release that tech till we run out of fossil fuels.
7927 2018-02-10 20:54:56 I need some kukui oil.... Where in the hell am I going to get some in KY??  Lemme search Amazon...they have everything!
7928 2018-02-10 20:54:41 Rub transdermal magnesium oil into your sore muscles... and find every bit of broken skin you never knew you had. Man, it burns!
7929 2018-02-10 20:54:33 I usually get clusters when I'm stressed. I put alum powder on them or swish my mouth with coconut oil.
7930 2018-02-10 20:54:27 Tried cbd oil and got nowhere with it sadly. But again some people find it really helps. Worth trying anything. I'm currently suffering a flare up from hell from trying a new osteopath but it gave me hope for a couple weeks! And she hardly touched me but im in agony!
7931 2018-02-10 20:54:19 Even the Canadian big guys are tak ng a beating. Works taking pay cuts, no overtime, larger work loads and no job security. May ppl have suffered, even though  has some of the most responsible and clean oil/gas.
7932 2018-02-10 20:54:17 Oh wow would love to try this oil! All done  thank you x
7933 2018-02-10 20:54:15 They're planning on going into South Africa sometime in the next 100 years or so to take the oil.
7934 2018-02-10 20:54:05 This is not hard to trace the trail. Only one person in Uganda owns ‘my money, my oil, my army, my police, my land’. Fill in the rest....

7937 2018-02-10 20:53:52 What? I'm a vegan. I definitely don't want to contribute to animal suffering. Yet, still, it *is* a minefield given the lack of info and general knowledge on the source of certain foods. You think everyone knows about palm oil etc?
7938 2018-02-10 20:53:42 attn twitter I'm treating my Lambo Pouch w coconut oil now
7939 2018-02-10 20:53:39 I follow back with the speed of 
@officialncdmb for updates on life changing opportunities like job opportunities, research grants, Single digit interest rate loans for businesses in the Oil and Gas Industry. Thanks me later.
7940 2018-02-10 20:53:22 they will continue to squash innovation for their own margins, and they have been recorded already stealing research. when oil runs out, they will try to maintain their grip on the throat of the US by abusing renewables next.
7941 2018-02-10 20:53:20 If you want govt to get out of the way..then you will not mind if the chemical company or Alta tar sands, fracking to pollute your environment? Or closer to home that your neighbor tosses old cars/fridges, or paint cans, used oil, all over his yard making it a hazardous dump?
7942 2018-02-10 20:53:18 Peppermint essential oil roller ball !
7943 2018-02-10 20:53:14 And have painstakingly continued. I feel like NNPC be unbundled including the downstream oil sector. Deregulate already....

7945 2018-02-10 20:52:58 Try preparing yourself for sleep first have a warm bath and then put some pure lavender oil on your pulse points and also few drops on the pillow then try some deep relaxation techniques, also make sure you have nothing electrical like tv mobile phone etc on for 30 mins before
7946 2018-02-10 20:52:55 Whole flax seeds contain both the fiber + oil, giving you all the nutritional value in one. Add 2 Tbsp ground flax seed to a Green Smoothie!
7947 2018-02-10 20:52:47 In reality they did. 57 + Sanders, Liberman =59. Republican Wing of dem party of just 1, Collins gives them super majority. All pro amnesty
7948 2018-02-10 20:52:44 one time i was cooking a ribeye and the oil splattered in my eye and tbh it didn’t hurt as bad as I thought it would
7949 2018-02-10 20:52:39 My dad was pressuring me to go get an oil change & check my brakes & I didn’t wanna go pay so when I got there he had already paid everything for me why am I spoiled

7952 2018-02-10 20:52:16 I wish there they made a Sun In for freckles so I wouldn't have to sit in the sun with all this damn coconut oil on my face
7953 2018-02-10 20:52:02 there's something about a cute boy changing my oil that just gets me going I swear autoshops are my kink
7954 2018-02-10 20:52:00 No. Antivax and Chemtrail idiots are scared of chemistry. They wouldn't have detergent in the house. They would only use organic olive oil soap made with natural lye.
7955 2018-02-10 20:51:31 @loynox replies: 

Second is on foreign exchange stability. following the global oil price slump in 2015 and the a lower-than-budgeted  daily production of crude oil due to Niger Delta crisis, there was a slump in the volume and value of foreign inflows into Nigeria between 2015

7960 2018-02-10 20:51:13 Obama open up oil drilling &  fracking more than even Trump. But unless u ride a bike, have wind computer, etc, its hypocrisy to talk bout energy. FYI Paris accords have NOTHING to do with enviro since biggest polluters dont have to do jack. Just a slush fund grab against USA
7961 2018-02-10 20:51:06 Does @RSPOtweets have an official response to this critique in this @Wikipedia article about #RSPO ? I was just looking to see if it is true that palm oil companies actually fund RSPO when I came across this.  #deforestation #humanrights #palmoil #auspol #greenwashing #orangutan

7963 2018-02-10 20:50:46 Politicians pander to stay in power, eg AB *NDP* pushing *an oil sands pipeline*! I think BC is one part seriously trying to mitigate risk to balance the reward, and one part putting up token resistance to pander to their outraged voters.

1/2
7964 2018-02-10 20:50:46 ? will try a slice if you have some olive oil @philvickerytv
7965 2018-02-10 20:50:44 Massage olive oil
7966 2018-02-10 20:50:43 One of Russia’s biggest export is fossil fuels. Why would they support Trump who wanted to open up drilling as part of his “make America great” plan? Why not rig election for Hillary who would have continued to shut down oil/coal/gas, giving Putin less competition?
7967 2018-02-10 20:50:29 Yeah I’d do mine and it would basically fuckin dissolve from the oil hahaha 
7968 2018-02-10 20:50:26 Definitely understand that! Pure lavender oil in a diffuser really helps me a lot when I can’t relax or am having a bad anxiety day
7969 2018-02-10 20:50:02 There's a lot of detail on that paint scheme.  Your truck is a beauty! 
7970 2018-02-10 20:49:38 Might as well go get a oil change too
7971 2018-02-10 20:49:19 The same disappointing amount? 

I think it lathers better the second time because a lot of the oil is gone. I’ve noticed that also.
7972 2018-02-10 20:49:00 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?

7975 2018-02-10 20:48:30 I would definitely enjoy a full Ayoub issue. But Fleming is just so... rich and... treacly. Like an oil goddess
7976 2018-02-10 20:48:24 Thank you for your support! However, the book is not a novel, but interviews with 25 women, many of whom have accomplished firsts in the #offshore_oil_gas_industry, and three of whom are the only women to have been inducted into the #Offshore_Energy_Center_Hall_of_Fame.
7977 2018-02-10 20:48:20 Why not protest the real unethical oil. Why not allow the inevitable supply of oil by the highest regulated energy sector in the world?
7978 2018-02-10 20:48:11 So wait, saying “fake news” is bad but glamorizing the Director of the Propaganda and Agitation Dept (actual title) is ok?
7979 2018-02-10 20:48:02 Yes. Just fire some missiles for godsake .. save oil rout. Haha
7980 2018-02-10 20:48:02 Fuck a pepper spray carry a water gun filled with peppermint oil instead

7984 2018-02-10 20:47:24 They probably fried that with not enough oil.

7988 2018-02-10 20:46:49 ...why let the petrol attendant check your oil if your car is smart enough to detect that? 
7989 2018-02-10 20:46:45 Do only oil tankers kill Whales ?
7990 2018-02-10 20:46:44 A well intentioned idea, but unfortunately impractical to see it through. The end result to that arguement would be that we should aim to take over the oil market worldwide in order to make sure its done correctly.
7991 2018-02-10 20:46:39 My brother has heard my dad tell me a million times to go get an oil change and I always forget, & today my brother was like “give me your keys Im taking It in for you oh my god. You’re lucky I love your dumbass.” 
Tbh Im touched lol
7992 2018-02-10 20:46:31 The Russians had no incentive to want Trump elected for at least three reasons. 
Rebuilding our military is not in Russia's interest.
Unleashing our energy industry is another reason, given that Russia’s economy depends heavily on exports of oil and gas.
7993 2018-02-10 20:46:13 They’r running short of monies for falling oil prices.I am sorry but I think Arabs are very clever and planning for their future survival. They are migrating from oil dependency to tourism, technology and renewable energy projects when we Pakistanis saying Sher aik wari phair.
7994 2018-02-10 20:45:53 Someone fried eggs in bacon oil and they forgot I’m allergic. It was disgusting.
7995 2018-02-10 20:45:49 Instead of blaming Trump should join him. Keep the good and weed out the bad. When it came to $ in budget dems suddenly forgot all about it
7996 2018-02-10 20:45:43 Oilers recall former Oil King Keegan Lowe from Bakersfield.
7997 2018-02-10 20:45:41 coooool i have to get my oil changed and i haven’t had breakfast:)))))))))
7998 2018-02-10 20:45:24 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
7999 2018-02-10 20:45:05 I dropped my car off to get an oil change and got it back with a huge chunk of paint missing from my car lol lorrrrrrt I'm about to flip shit
8000 2018-02-10 20:45:01 While I wasnt the biggest fan of Obama. Trump is definitely worse, all the deregulation of coal, oil, and gas companies, pulling out of the paris climate accord, his terrible tax plan, and his constant lying. Trump hasn't been a good president.
8001 2018-02-10 20:44:31 I see what your saying but if you read the article he didn’t flaunt anytning. TMZ are simply stating how much the oil change costs, Flyod didn’t say anything lol
8002 2018-02-10 20:44:31 Oil or wood?  I know where you can get parts for that if needed
8003 2018-02-10 20:44:22 Yes! CBD oil gummy edibles are supposed to help with anxiety and depression!(they’re legal in the states too!)
8004 2018-02-10 20:44:20 The Palestinians are just the beginning  Their are two countries left to be destroyed SYRIA and lRAN then the puzzle will be complete by USA  and ISRAEL  The Middle East is now in rubble but the OIL fields are protected by US ??
8005 2018-02-10 20:44:17 Make an effort to avoid anything made of oil. Plastic/fuels/paints/chemicals/pretty much anything a wal-mart.
8006 2018-02-10 20:44:12 The focus needs to be on collaboration between countries where easy growth using cheaper and most pollutant fossil fuels (coal and oil) is slowly replaced by a combination of less pollutant natural gas (both through pipeline and liquefied natural gas) and renewables.

8008 2018-02-10 20:44:02 As long as he concentrates on rugby, the worlds oil rigs, jet aircraft and underwater exploration submarines will be safe.
8009 2018-02-10 20:43:44 I don't pretend to escape the oil products at all. I don't think that we can survive without oil currently.  Pipelines do transport oil efficiently. I am not arguing against this. What I am saying as maybe the anti-pipeline folks is what if Kalamazoo happens in BC? What then?
8010 2018-02-10 20:43:34 Try green tea & a fish oil pill
8011 2018-02-10 20:43:02 DOES ANYONE IN THE DOUGLAS AREA HAVE COCONUT OIL AS I ACCIDENTALLY ASKED THE BARBER TO SHAVE MY HEAD AND I LOOK LIKE A 13 YEAR OLD YOUNG OFFENDER (apparantly it helps increase blood circulation and thus hair grows faster) RAG IS TOMORROW PEOPLE!!!
8012 2018-02-10 20:42:57 Baghdad won't pay oil companies in KRG:  the KRG will most likely pay oil companies in the KRG out of their lump sum revenue share transfers each month.
8013 2018-02-10 20:42:57 I have really dry skin too  I use ponds and roseship oil
8014 2018-02-10 20:42:53 Also Latino voters mostly vote Dems. So of course Dems want to use Dreamers who mostly are of spanish descent. They are like guaranteed votes the more they say we want to help dreamers. Yet keep backing down when it comes to actually helping them. So I hope peeps see the obvious.
8015 2018-02-10 20:42:50 Well sure, with a vinaigrette or oil dressing
8016 2018-02-10 20:42:48 Bombs Iranian oil fields. That’s the end of this regime. No money no terror activities. #End of Mullas.
8017 2018-02-10 20:42:40 Waiting on my oil change and the #Olympics are on. There’s an event where they scrub the ice ahead of a Rumba looking thing. They get the idea that one day I want to scrub the ice in the Olympics. And they’re so serious...

8020 2018-02-10 20:42:09 Leí los reviews sobre ellos hace un tiempo. Y no es dead skin, si no el material con skin oil. Es un light scrub que te hace pensar que está sacando muchas células muertas.
8021 2018-02-10 20:42:03 Well OK, but far more than 20 millions Russians perished fighting the Third Reich. Seige of Stalingrad has no comparison in the West and preventing Hitler from gaining access to Romanian oil fields was key to stopping his Eastern European plans.
8022 2018-02-10 20:42:00 Call the WAHmbulance!  Someone was mean to Big Oil! Someone cares about the environment more than Big baby oil’s profits. Get outta here with that bs. You’ve already got tRump and Tillerson denying climate change for you! stfu
8023 2018-02-10 20:41:57 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, But they do not all pop at the same time..My children never compete with anyone in your life ,your time will come
8024 2018-02-10 20:41:42 Wande is a blend of prawns, shrimps , eggs , livers, fish inside moin moin, Kiss Daniel is the leave, oil and fire. Complete package.
8025 2018-02-10 20:41:42 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
8026 2018-02-10 20:41:34 Dems threw DACA under bus when they smelled $ in this spending bill. Fact is thry had super majority under Obama and could have done it
8027 2018-02-10 20:41:31 I managed to get the oil changed though, and am now going to stay holed up in my apt until I need to go to the lab tomorrow for work.
8028 2018-02-10 20:41:27 Hair salon where you could get an oil change & your nails done at the same time & you could wear & for peace. #ThingsIShouldInvent
8029 2018-02-10 20:41:25 Supermarkets sell Wilkinson sword single blade razors and the blades as well make sure you buy some pre shaving oil it keeps the skin libricated also to avoid cuts shave slowly with no hesitations
8030 2018-02-10 20:41:18 It’ll be a capsule full of castor oil 
8031 2018-02-10 20:41:18 The North's stake is the oil resource control right?  So, let's say the oil fields and refineries of Nigeria were closed and shuttered.  So, UK should be told, if they want to undo their error, to get their oil elsewhere and indigenous will develop their own economy.
8032 2018-02-10 20:40:51 If you truly believe such you'll immediately give away all devices you use for tweeting/email/etc since oil provides you such luxuries
Actually almost everything in your life relies on oil
Tell how you'll exist without pipelines
& then there's equalization payments funded by oil
8033 2018-02-10 20:40:40 I’m all for Canadian oil. But we can’t keep subsidizing the oil sector like we do say @Bombardier - imo it seems like these two fields know they’ll be bailed out and or used for politics which will result in funding if not a complete bail out
8034 2018-02-10 20:40:32 Israel has taken its biggest step into the Syrian war yet. What does that mean?IT MEANS TREASONOUS DRUMPF 'n his REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORPORATE "KOCH"-SUK'N GESTAPO ARE BLEEDIN' OUR TAX DOLLARS !!! THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS !!

8036 2018-02-10 20:40:11 Making me bruised head to toe from not being able to walk normally while having dystonia spasms and hitting the wall and furniture. The only thing that has reduced my dystonia spasms has been CBD oil at high doses in tinctures.

8039 2018-02-10 20:39:53 And here we were enjoying those cute, cuddly #oil demand forecasts.
8040 2018-02-10 20:39:34 If Dems were sincere about Dreamers they would have been included in the Budget bill. They were not. It was more important to increase gov. spending so they don't look like they are against military. Dreamers thrown under bus again.
8041 2018-02-10 20:39:33 Oh I would love to try the cannabis oil. I hear that really helps with pain..
8042 2018-02-10 20:39:25 Just realised that tomorrow is Sunday and I have a meeting at 11 am. 
Guess who’ll be burning midnight oil tonight making the presentation?
8043 2018-02-10 20:39:22 The end product of this party is just going to be painful, because nobody will change oil as camera is everywhere in the #BBNaija house 
8044 2018-02-10 20:39:18 Electric cars, regardless of were the electricity comes from, is also good for the economy because we don’t have to waste our hard earned cash on importing the oil for gasoline powered vehicles.
8045 2018-02-10 20:39:17 So did oil.
8046 2018-02-10 20:39:11 Are you saying you can't party while your oil gets changed? I'm quite disappointed that you haven't had this experience.
8047 2018-02-10 20:38:55 i rather fry myself in the krispy kreme oil than work there another minute
8048 2018-02-10 20:38:55 #embarrassingmoment getting an oil change. Bought Hot Cheeto fries because haven’t eaten all day. The guy comes back to tell me about my car. Then I have like a coughing attack and he needs to go get me water 
8049 2018-02-10 20:38:38 On a recent #jjgo ep, @RickyCarmona said he likes to pan-fry fresh fish in coconut oil, after putting salt and pepper on both sides, and it’s the easiest awesome recipe ever. 5 minutes on each side, and done! Slice of lemon or other spices if desired, but delicious even without.
8050 2018-02-10 20:38:26 Spatial
How long does it take to win a war?
Agree Wars cost way to much.
Why not get a map of Middle East and plot out Oil Reserves ....
Hint wars are about Oil, the rest is Politics.
8051 2018-02-10 20:38:18 "We've been sold a bushel of lies, a barrel of snake oil."
8052 2018-02-10 20:38:13 Super proud of myself for being roductive and finally getting my oil changed. I also got a new pair of work shoes after having holes in mine for 4 months. Go me!
8053 2018-02-10 20:38:12 why do I own burning incense AND candles AND an oil burner AND I still spray my room with perfume
8054 2018-02-10 20:38:10 Yoruba people it’s Oil not hoil 
8055 2018-02-10 20:38:10 I put vitamin E oil/rose water mix on my crusty ass lips before bed n now they're soft pillows I'm amazed
8056 2018-02-10 20:38:04 I saw it a lot back in Thailand. a big wok with lots of oil.
8057 2018-02-10 20:38:01 Listening to some early afternoon @Rebelshockey hockey against the Oil Kings while working at @rdpl.
8058 2018-02-10 20:37:43 I crashed my car and I still need to take it to get an oil change. Lmao
8059 2018-02-10 20:37:36 Oil Kings white alternate jerseys are slightly less egregious than their blacks
8060 2018-02-10 20:37:28 Their $ comes from the likes of gates foundation, rockafeller foundationand the rest of American elite that want CDN oil at the current discounted price and not world price Tides is a front for political gain of the elite of which Trudeau is part and Butts so much wants to be
8061 2018-02-10 20:37:28 Well the Democrats are not doing Dreamers any favors. They are using dreamers to get support and votes. Which is why they keep kicking the can down the road. That dreamers will be used to get them elected with the same promise to help them if more Dems get in.
8062 2018-02-10 20:37:00 MLs are just people who would rather see the state pollute multiple water bodies with oil reserves instead of corporations
8063 2018-02-10 20:36:54 I just had a little Thai dude oil me up and walk all over me for an hour ..best thing ever!
8064 2018-02-10 20:36:50 Thought taking a knee was brave and courageous.
8065 2018-02-10 20:36:50 That’s sort of my thought too. They’re 100% the kind of guys a lot of Oil fans want on the team
8066 2018-02-10 20:36:49 sometimes I put the chili oil in the beer! It's yummy!!!
8067 2018-02-10 20:36:48 I beg you to bomb Iranian oil fields. They are the only sources of the money they have. With help of Iranian people we will destroy this regime. It is great for both nations to become friends again.
8068 2018-02-10 20:36:46 Also, these water/ oil  based perfumes some people use smell strong AF 
8069 2018-02-10 20:36:35 Bitches be tryna be slick but ain’t shit slicker than a can of oil dummy 
8070 2018-02-10 20:36:35 This tea tree oil and eucalyptus conditioner tingle on my scalp
8071 2018-02-10 20:36:34 That moment when the CBD oil kick in and your grandfather comes out of the room fully dressed and ready to eat
8072 2018-02-10 20:36:33 Sergej is not the type of person to join an oil tanker like PSG or Man City. United the most likely destination, big supporter + brother joined
8073 2018-02-10 20:36:08 Does he wear a special heat insulating body oil?
8074 2018-02-10 20:36:02 i’m moving out. i’m done. my dog is whining and my mom goes “someone needs to oil the dog he’s squeaky” i cant live here anymore my humor is no match
8075 2018-02-10 20:36:01 Finally got some castor oil.
8076 2018-02-10 20:35:54 We generate our own money, through the sale of oil 
8077 2018-02-10 20:35:48 Applied this hot oil treatment to my hair hope it helps
8078 2018-02-10 20:35:42 My heart 
Who will I get anointing oil for? 
8079 2018-02-10 20:35:01 if all conditions are right, you fried it for like 5 seconds and scoop it up with strainer spatula

It can be done with pan with not as much oil too, honestly. still crispy edge and runny yok
8080 2018-02-10 20:34:59 Apart from being able to remain and/or being able to join the eu immediately, oil prices and being better off to name but three.
8081 2018-02-10 20:34:59 I don’t take biotin and use castor oil consistently but I need to give a shout-out to my parents real quick for these exquisite genetics 
8082 2018-02-10 20:34:30 What do we actually do Saturday ... take my seats out and deep clean/vacuum it to get all the hair out and Clean out the bed of the truck to get all the oil and garbage out.
8083 2018-02-10 20:34:23 Coal is from plant matter, oil from kerogen that is generally from marine algae or microscopic organisms.  These hydrocarbons form from natural, organic processes and are part of the earth’s carbon cycle.  We use these products because of their high energy density and portability
8084 2018-02-10 20:34:12 Westminster runs the country. SG only controls what has been devolved. Oil and Gas isn’t. All SG can do is help around the periphery - funding training etc. SG has to rely on WM to aid directly as Holyrood doesn’t have the power. It’s not hard.
8085 2018-02-10 20:34:11 So Chia gets a three extension for calling up Lowe's son? Never change Oil.
8086 2018-02-10 20:33:35 Add to it the fact the relationship of CL, to the S&P500, is inverted, as oil price is positively correlated to inflation, which is negatively correlated to S&P500 valuation.
8087 2018-02-10 20:33:35 Wouldnt b 2 much in a hurry 2 call it a failed state unless u meant #IslamicState

8088 2018-02-10 20:33:33 "I have been seeing a lot of Zero lookalikes lately... Perhaps that I might have been drinking a lot of oil recently?"
8089 2018-02-10 20:33:31 Goldman is bullish on oil. I dont know who to believe anymore
8090 2018-02-10 20:33:26 I need to get some coconut oil
8091 2018-02-10 20:33:25 one thing when we was dependants of foriegn oil and energy... not the case any more...
8092 2018-02-10 20:33:24 Wish coconut oil worked on heartbreaks
8093 2018-02-10 20:33:15 OIH is only 15% above the 2016 low (when oil was crashing to the mid 20s).

Oil is still 125% above its 2016 low.

Is this move in the oil service names overdone, or is this group in real trouble?
8094 2018-02-10 20:33:14 If you’re serious try CBD oil for pets. Im not a weed guy at all but it worked for my dog
8095 2018-02-10 20:33:10 RT brcrites14: So lately I’ve been having major headaches and having trouble going to sleep. I took 5 drops of CBD oil last night and i slept like a freaking baby! With no headache! My mother sells it y’all so let me know if you want some!!!
8096 2018-02-10 20:33:09 "Político" de quinta!!! México no merece gente como usted haciendo política
8097 2018-02-10 20:33:09 Another bad thing with this their weekend party is that, you will drink, get high, and still go to bed individually, even without changing oil  #BBNaija
8098 2018-02-10 20:33:04 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
8099 2018-02-10 20:32:58 Working people are hungry because V is overpopulated & they don't produce enough food. Their economy has been too dependent on oil & so lacked resiliance when price fell.
8100 2018-02-10 20:32:48 i rly wish i wouldn’t of lost that half gram of oil. i need all the weeds i can get 
8101 2018-02-10 20:32:21 Im came to do an oil change and idk wtf they’re talking about lmao
8102 2018-02-10 20:32:21 sometimes you just have to admit that the world is dumb and the world is mean, and that's okay
8103 2018-02-10 20:31:29 Saying no to Alberta literally means saying yes to Trump, and the balance shipped from the desert.  Can’t believe that BC willing supports Trump oil. 
8104 2018-02-10 20:31:18 They must be drilling for some oil
8105 2018-02-10 20:31:04 Productive day! Breakfast, oil change, car wash, picked up some mail from my parents, now a pedicure!!
8106 2018-02-10 20:30:55 You might want to tell that to the people who have sued the government because they bought property and built houses near a capped oil well...that refilled and blew its cap.
8107 2018-02-10 20:30:42 Ok here’s the thing.  Canada has the strictest oil and gas regs and standards in the world.  Oil and gas from other jurisdictions will fill the demand if we don’t, while causing more damage and less benefit to our social services.
8108 2018-02-10 20:30:25 Yes, but who is supposed to be running this country. When it all kicked off I think people up here might have liked it to have been recognized as a major issue. Instead, one local SNP MSP came out and claimed there was no crisis in the oil industry. That should read Now Ex MSP.

Yet Kinder Morgan pipeline causes huge climate change damage world wide - from the extraction of the tar sands processing - oil tankers burning oil the processing of it in China to the burning of this dirty oil
8111 2018-02-10 20:29:41 Fools and their money are soon parted.  Also his ‘friends’ are all getting kickbacks with benefits. Further I am not buying it was just “an oil change” more BS free publicity as to “ look how dumb I am”

8114 2018-02-10 20:29:11 Great question from our future group of bokashi folks - “Could I compost cooked food with salt or oil?” The bokashi man says “Yes!”
8115 2018-02-10 20:29:10 You’re having a bad day. Tell ya what.. why don’t you check into the car wash, treat yourself to some new tires and an oil change! Turn things around! I don’t serve cars, but if you’re ever brave enough to not hide behind twitter I’ll send you a nice edible arrangement. 
8116 2018-02-10 20:28:29 a STAR Olive Oil + Balsamic Vinegar and Cruet Set for me!
8117 2018-02-10 20:28:24 Okay but listen, k*le chips with olive oil and some garlic salt are the bomb
8118 2018-02-10 20:28:10 Why does it take forever to get an oil change? 
8119 2018-02-10 20:27:52 Religions are designed to keep the masses in line, not the preachers, politicians, kings or queens.
Religion truly is the opiate of the masses and the snake oil of the charlatans.

A 4-day school week for the entire state system? Mess. While oil men got massive tax breaks. An embarrassment.
8122 2018-02-10 20:27:08 Yeah I know what you mean when I was breaking out I was gonna try anything too. But tea tree oil is the way to go! To stops and kills the bacteria that causes acne!
8123 2018-02-10 20:27:07 my parents are visiting a relative’s house and instead of bringing flowers my dad wants to bring them a jug of olive oil LMAAAOOOOOOO i hate arabs

8125 2018-02-10 20:26:50 Another movie for you here: There Will Be Blood. The DDLewis character puts on fake Christianity to help him acquire land he wants to develop for oil. Reminiscent of you-know-who doing likewise for votes.
8126 2018-02-10 20:26:49 me: *goes in for a $19.99 oil change (with coupon obvi)*.... also me: *gets talked into a bunch of extra add ons and FORGETS TO USE MY COUPON!!!!!* I’m peeved, talk about a rough day 2 b me!!!

8130 2018-02-10 20:26:08 Raw sewage, deforesting, massive strip mining all are okay. Somehow nary a peep at those atrocities, but pipe is the end of the world. Sadly the only thing that stops is Alberta oil. We’re the good guys. Sad for Canada that BC supports Trump and Desert monopoly oil.

8138 2018-02-10 20:26:03 there no way changing oil should ever take more then a hour the longest part is waiting for it to all drain and the oil filter
8139 2018-02-10 20:26:02 America is now selling oil, why can’t we take all money received to pay down America debt.
8140 2018-02-10 20:25:55 I neeeed to get my oil changed & this weather is getting in my mf way. btch.
8141 2018-02-10 20:25:55 Strictly speaking, Trump has not yet done anything concrete against the mullahs and would rather do a nice deal with them and get cheaper oil and gas from them than help the people of Iran to get rid of the tyrants.

8143 2018-02-10 20:25:52 Check out world wide demand for oil - only going up.

8145 2018-02-10 20:25:25 You're totally right. That's one of the major reasons why you're not always blamed for being wrong at this sector. We're all trying to throw some educated guesses. Our guesses aren't checked by hundreds of people before it's released. Remember Goldman Sachs' call $80 oil by June?

8150 2018-02-10 20:24:39 it’s healthier for your hair to have some oil in it because the dye dries it out
8151 2018-02-10 20:24:36 If you had only one match, and entered a dark room containing an oil lamp, some newspaper, and some kindling wood, which would you light first?
8152 2018-02-10 20:24:29 I actually use beard oil from the Detroit Beard Collective and I use their beard shampoo.  I have really dry skin on my upper lip and it helps a ton. You could also ask your barber what they recommend.
8153 2018-02-10 20:24:21 Take a look at syrian map again please. Ypg controls almost 1/3 of the country, until the Iraqi border, and a lot of oil fields. But Kurds are only 1/10 compared to arab population.Manbij Tel Rifaat, Rakka, Tabqa, all of them, invaded by Ypg
8154 2018-02-10 20:24:20 I can't see how anti-pipeline folks would be so dogmatic. In any case, looks like this pipeline is headed to court. If fracking in USA results in high output, I guess the price of oil will go down so the economic case for our oil is kaput. Long term recession in AB inevitable.

8161 2018-02-10 20:23:15 But they still way ahead..I think they found oil in the 80s..some of scams like NYS was done 30yrs ago in Nigeria..
Read about the 'nigerian 419 scam' which was done ages ago ndio inafika Nairobi..
Babe these people are goals..we need to live in muthaiga

8165 2018-02-10 20:22:47 Credit unions are great now.  Great online banking system with 1st United. The banks ARE funding DAPL!  Some promised to divest from Oil.  Did you see the article about the demonstrations they were having in Min a week ago? Against the banks who promised but haven't divested yet.
8166 2018-02-10 20:22:30 Sad because we’re no where near being remotely close to having oil out of our lives. It’ll be around and required for many years. Instead of allowing what’s flowed through pipelines for well over 50 years, BC is stopping it. Not cuz they’re not going to use it cuz it’s not theirs
8167 2018-02-10 20:22:29 Currently use tea tree oil on my feet to keep them from stinking...
8168 2018-02-10 20:22:27 Why is everybody in #Syria? #US, #EU, #Russia? All of them are located far away from the #MiddleEast. The answer is #power, #hegemony, #profit. Everything is related with this showdown. #Gunrunning, #narcotrafficking, #oil and #gas which are kept back from competitors. Dominance!
8169 2018-02-10 20:22:16 Every car user and food eater contributes here. A minor remote byproduct of 100M barrels of oil consumed daily ... a thousand barrels a second !!
8170 2018-02-10 20:21:49 matt i hope u read what I wrote to Olaf. Canada can afford it’s healthy system because of its sale of oil &gas. U know...

8174 2018-02-10 20:20:53 I really like the Primal Kitchen Avocado oil Ranch. Its gotta be my favorite. 
8175 2018-02-10 20:20:47 But even if they had done nothing complaining to SG is like moaning to the postman that the milkman was late. SG controls some stuff WM controls the rest. Guess who controls oil and gas? 2/2
8176 2018-02-10 20:20:35 Or maybe they just want to squeeze some concessions, get oil, hard currency etc and keep on keepin’ on.

8179 2018-02-10 20:20:22 Someone get me some oil blotting sheets smh 
8180 2018-02-10 20:20:18 The sad thing about all of what you’re saying is having Canada close shop on oil. Why sad? Because it means we will have to import it from the US or desert countries. And believe me, the Canadian industry is far superior on environmental protection than either of the choices. Sad
8181 2018-02-10 20:19:58 اتمنى من الجهات المسؤله معاقبته على هذه الكلمات اللتي لا تليق اولا على نساء الوطن  ثانيا انها تطلع من كاتب !؟
8182 2018-02-10 20:19:41 I feel it. I went there once, and they really do push the agenda, and don’t value business. Oil changers in Vallejo is quick and easy. They really only upsell a cabin filter, but they don’t push it.
8183 2018-02-10 20:19:37 “Seem”
8184 2018-02-10 20:19:35 good article, but maybe misses some key points about the health risks of processed palm oil and studies that indicate it acts to combat your own natural appetite suppressants. Let alone the fact efforts on sustainable sourcing have totally failed
8185 2018-02-10 20:19:29 It's now stranded capital! As the world moves to EV and low cost oil at $20 - $25 per barrel,  high cost oil sources will not be viable
8186 2018-02-10 20:19:29 What is the best route economically and politically to either restructuring or a referendum, assuming Nigeria wants to remain the 6th largest oil exporter in the world?
8187 2018-02-10 20:19:22 Prior to amalgamation, the north were doing fine economically and politically. The northern agriculture was d back bone of early Nigerian economy before the discovery of crude oil. I guess you are the one distorting history here.

8189 2018-02-10 20:19:01 Already sat through two oil changes, shopped at Target, gone grocery shopping at Kroger, and ran 2 miles. Working on “dude perfect” themed video with the boys next. Cleaning house and drinking beer to follow that. #meeither
8190 2018-02-10 20:19:01 風呂で寝るの今週何度目や！
8191 2018-02-10 20:18:57 That said watch products incredible amount of refining going on to drain supply...turning an oil glut into a product glut is just shuffling the problem...so Im watching product #s closely
8192 2018-02-10 20:18:52 Depends on the quantity of protein you are searing.  3-4 tablespoons...not a bunch.  Covering the pan in the oil should do the trick.  But remember olive oil heats really quick, vegetable oils take longer to heat and sustain a higher heat without burning.
8193 2018-02-10 20:18:46 Ma’am I got nothing. Coconut oil isn’t terrible but she doing too much. The baby got length cause she ain’t got a neck yet. Crazy
8194 2018-02-10 20:18:46 How heartbreaking that now us stupid humans have decided krill oil has massive skin benefits & we are taking it from the sea when it's not for us; it's whale, seal & penguin food 
8195 2018-02-10 20:18:31 When next you're in Nigerian oil money sharing chamber, spread this word one on one to your fellow oil money beneficiaries. Also when you come across your fellow retired and serving politicians. Oil's only brought misery and destruction to many 're. 'll be glad to see it dry up.

8214 2018-02-10 20:16:05 I'm giddy about the reflation trade
  Just concerned with oil prices.  We aren't having oversupply issues globally are we?
8215 2018-02-10 20:16:01 Good points - with oil ‘nothing is as it seems’ is a good motto to keep in mind
8216 2018-02-10 20:15:53 Food not fresh esp fish. Some dripping in oil. Some way too dry. Burger meat was frozen packet crap. Brown wilting salad. Plus wait time 45 mins between mains and other mains arriving. Bloody expensive for what you get. @HogsBreath is shit.

8243 2018-02-10 20:11:47 Where do you think the pdx cut rumors will come from to stabilize oil price?  Or when they'll come?
8244 2018-02-10 20:11:40 but that's the point, no matter what the public demand in their product, some less scrupulous or food to go suppliers who don't publish ingredients won't care. So any palm oil from dodgy sources will still get sold into the channel based on price

8263 2018-02-10 20:09:16 And of course, if oil is involved with ANY conflict, you know the greedy bastards in DC are going to push for concern anywhere in the world. 2 things, either grow oil in America or eliminate the dependency. Oil weakens. Oil kills. Bring back horses . Breathe the air again.

8278 2018-02-10 20:07:14 Btw, a "shill" is taken from conmen having plants in the crowd when selling their snake oil to make it sound good. Bill, whether because all his friends are part of the establishment or whatever, is that figure, placed in the leftist crowd, selling imperialism to us.

8280 2018-02-10 20:07:08 “Peak” anything is wrong because it ignores basic economic behaviors, namely market forces, substitution and technological advances. No one talks about peak whale oil or kerosene anymore.
8281 2018-02-10 20:06:51 Yes that's so true! for example went i take a bath and include sea salt to help  the my muscles to relaxat them, even if i put oil and soap in it, my skin after is verry dry!

8291 2018-02-10 20:06:06 In my last years of work in Saudi Arabia, they just completed gas capture plants & installed pipeline network to transmit to a new Red Sea port nearJeddah for export via Suez. In mid 70s, gas just burnt in oil refineries. Air pollution from asphalt & concrete plants since 70s.

8301 2018-02-10 20:04:29 I searched for it in Spanish, I found a link of a report that I gave in Spain on this topic. I think that while the real "Owners of the Planet"(Rockefeller, Bilderberg, etc) continue to win with oil, there will be no third economic industrial revolution. Let's face it, Mr.Carrey.
8302 2018-02-10 20:04:26 Big Congratulations to Ted Potter, Jr for a breathtaking first 10 holes of -8 to get within a couple of the lead at ATT Pebble Beach.  I bet Ted for $20 at 25-1 odds for a top 10 finish.  So nice to be on a reliable, experienced player.  Go Ted Go !! @pgatour
8303 2018-02-10 20:04:22 When I make pancakes I also get pancakes... eventually. Usually after not having the pan hot enough and having the pan too hot and not having enough oil and not putting enough batter in and putting too much batter in and using the wrong spatula and etc. etc. etc.
8304 2018-02-10 20:04:00 they have to cut off the money coming in from oil to hurt russia. besides that just about nothing else really matters to russia sure you can go after a few people but it does not really her putin. fuck russia hires north koreans to work for them braking major laws.
8305 2018-02-10 20:03:48 I truly, honestly hope you are right because there is no way the oil lobbyists will allow a vote above 4% for many years to come.

8307 2018-02-10 20:03:37 Not really, some elasticity variance, but general trend confirmation.  Apart from the initial drop, XOM provided no confirmation trend comparable to FANGS. To support your view oil led the drop would require leadership, which the data does not confirm.
8308 2018-02-10 20:03:33 Secular decline is a fact. Iran/Iraq have low cost oil but are exceptional. However, agree plenty oil outcompetes tar-sands etc. Renewable substitution & efficiency savings are now kicking in big time. Paradigm is shifting from energy as commodity/good to energy as service

8319 2018-02-10 20:02:38 Yet your government's latest excuse for trading off the environment is *what we can get out of it*.  Notley's price for supporting the pan Canadian Framework was pipelines.  You gave oil sands 100Mt of Canada's 524Mt carbon budget - a budget that is not yet ambitious enough.

8323 2018-02-10 20:01:44 It was only when the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, that syria was attacked. How can ksa compete with Russia oil production? Usa and uk are protecting the petrodollar.

8348 2018-02-10 19:59:09 (2/2) Further, if you're *that* concerned about our economy, you should be advocating for investment in green energy - *not* nuclear or "clean" coal (gag) - modern infrastructure, and a zero waste economy - things that create more jobs here than the oil & gas industry ever will.

8385 2018-02-10 19:54:26 I am an AB res.  We need a better price for our oil that means we need tidewater. BC wants to protect their coastline from any damage. The extra ship traffic is invasive.

8416 2018-02-10 19:50:02 do you understand why we preferred bernie over hillary now mrs. reid?  we want someone who will stand up to oil companies and banks and pharma companies, etc.  hillary makes profitable deals with them to benefit herself.  bernie takes them on.
8417 2018-02-10 19:49:58 The fact is to the bigger economy it doesn't matter if the money is created/destroyed when it enters the black box of government. It could be thrown in a bit vat of oil, boiled, dried, sorted, reinked, before being reissued. from the outside world, its all the same.
8418 2018-02-10 19:49:30 It’s my usual! Make it garlic olive oil and olive bread for extra flavor
8419 2018-02-10 19:49:28 As long as Rex, McMaster, Haley in place; Hillary Clinton's wars will be ongoing. If it was safe I would tell you all but I don't like what I see. 
Rex working w/Condi, Bush, Saddam - big oil. I suggested Dr Carson be placed as SOS. The most honest person we have in US Admin.
8420 2018-02-10 19:49:16 So far we’ve learned Tonga is the greatest importer of baby oil
8421 2018-02-10 19:49:09 One thing this study shows clearly is that the bulk of subsidies worldwide are not to support oil and gas industries: they are consumption, not production subsidies. This is by the way one of the reason they are difficult to get rid off: it may trigger political instability.
8422 2018-02-10 19:49:07 I've always fancied the oil and charcoal mediums, so I figure it's time to swing by the art store and try and make good on that threat as well.

8425 2018-02-10 19:48:23 Kirstin Hillinrand is a fraud, pretends to be concerned with abuse, while indicating Hilary is her role model. Snake oil politician.
8426 2018-02-10 19:48:16 Apply product containing castor oil to eyebrows to stimulate hair growth and promote thickness.
8427 2018-02-10 19:48:09 Why are we pitting our products against each other?  Wake up Canada!  We should be promoting and accelerating access to all our resources be it oil, wine, whatever!  The economic policies south of the border are no joke and Canada needs to be competitive Let’s support each other.
8428 2018-02-10 19:48:08 going to start putting castor oil on my eyebrows i want them thicker...have that kelly baker brow  look for when i don’t fill them in
8429 2018-02-10 19:48:06 Venezuela's Chavismo is a factory of death, violence & cocaine. The country with the largest oil reserves in the world is now facing famine, infrastructure collapse and a refugee crisis after two decades under Chávez and Maduro. Chávez is responsible for thousands of deaths.

8433 2018-02-10 19:47:32 Rizinusöl heißt im Englischen "castor oil", weil es als Ersatz für die Parfümgrundlage Castoreum (dt. "Bibergeil"), dem Sekret der Drüsensäcke des Bibers, verwendet wurde (lat. Castor = Biber).

Irgendwann wird diese Information sicher einmal sehr relevant für mich sein.
8434 2018-02-10 19:47:09 Let's take in more. We need more low skill poorly educated ppl just becse.

8443 2018-02-10 19:46:13 omg, i don’t believe you said that. you generate more accusations based on lies, half truths and imaginary conspiracy theories. don the con, you are a snake oil salesman.
8444 2018-02-10 19:45:37 And they don't even hear themselves - his parents brought him here a couple yrs after the ReaganAmnesty which was to *stop* illegal immigration, but Democrats reneged and lied. #ContextMatters
8445 2018-02-10 19:45:34 They told me it would be a 3 hour wait for an oil change. I never peeled out of a god damn parking lot faster in my life

8447 2018-02-10 19:44:58 Originally, saying what his fossil-fuel  sponsors wanted, Scott Pruitt denied global warming altogether. Oklahoma has become one of least- educated and most rundown states in the Union, thanks to big oil, big religion and Scott Pruitt.

8451 2018-02-10 19:44:06 Kale is delicious! And coconut oil is awesome. But I love my kale sautéed with okive oil and garlic. Thank you very much.
8452 2018-02-10 19:44:06 Thing is with oil money you can buy without consequences. People like Bernado Silva are extremely quickly moved on from.
8453 2018-02-10 19:43:56 #Cult45 & Facts = Oil & Water
8454 2018-02-10 19:43:49 Do you want another receipt?
8455 2018-02-10 19:43:31 So stop being lazy, deep condition weekly, do DIY treatments, hot oil treatments, trim your ends every 2-3 months. Get rid of shampoo’s that have toxic ingredients
8456 2018-02-10 19:43:27 Yay or nay, must be better to be using 'green' sun/sea/wind power rather than oil/gas, no fracking, oil spills, less wars,  and no end to the supply?
8457 2018-02-10 19:43:27 Do you remember Sonia Gandhi’s dealings with Iraq(Saddam Hussein) in oil-for-programme? Where did the food come from? Where did the oils proceeds went? Food grains were looted from Indians and sold to Saddam for personal wealth. Wake up man, your future is at stake here.
8458 2018-02-10 19:43:23 I use California olive oil for mine; it's less likely to be adulterated compared to imported brands.

8461 2018-02-10 19:43:12 And also Ireland that has no oil, assess their development with Nigeria's ( the oil nation) you'll see that the difference is axiom
8462 2018-02-10 19:42:54 Can we use crude oil? The U.S. has an abundance of it, not need for imported oil.
8463 2018-02-10 19:42:21 A car oil kink
8464 2018-02-10 19:42:19 The number of oil & gas rigs in the US has increased 38% over the past year. The country had 1,070 rigs at the end of January, up from just 773 a year ago. The # of rigs has increased in the few days since January ended. There are now 3 more rigs in operation, 61 more pending.
8465 2018-02-10 19:42:15 I still can’t get over how we’re cracking the earths crust to extract oil when the resources are in the sky. Wind and solar!!!  & 
8466 2018-02-10 19:42:09 Perfectly well said.
8467 2018-02-10 19:42:01 Having to eat vegetables. The horror of it.
8468 2018-02-10 19:41:59 2/.  And the sovereign wealth fund is so diversified at this point that oil sales is a minority of its income.
8469 2018-02-10 19:41:52 30% of Americans (who voted for him),were feeling desperate for change.They believed his rhetoric,& blindly desperate to believe he was going to help the middle class.
You have been conned by a snake oil salesman!He is really only in this to create smoke screens while bilking ur$

8472 2018-02-10 19:41:10 Probably even per capita.  Norway is expected to run out of oil far sooner than Venezuela
8473 2018-02-10 19:41:07 Do you know anything about oil is traded on the international market? Have you heard of forward contracts? If the government investigates this thoroughly it will be another massive scam by UPA.
8474 2018-02-10 19:41:00 Nice try Kalia. They want the Gloan because of all the oil and natural gas the Zionists want to steal.
8475 2018-02-10 19:40:55 Craving bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar! 
8476 2018-02-10 19:40:47 My car feels so much better now that I’ve gotten an oil change
8477 2018-02-10 19:40:41 Yeah but we generate it they get there money from Oil, don't be stupid. We generate our money unlike them

8479 2018-02-10 19:40:21 I'm not really a follower of Musk but I do know that Tesla has repaid all of its Government loans with interest. Tesla may have started the transition to electric cars but many other companies are in the race now & many Governments are phasing out oil powered cars.
8480 2018-02-10 19:40:21 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
8481 2018-02-10 19:40:20 Yeah, but what I always say is if a oil rich Sheikh came to United I wouldn’t give a fuck about what we spent, and you’d be the same if one rocked up at the Macron!
8482 2018-02-10 19:40:08 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
8483 2018-02-10 19:39:54 Is it weird that I enjoy stew made with palmnut oil?
8484 2018-02-10 19:39:41 Yeah. I don't know enough about these pipelines beside my suspicion that it's about who gets that last bit of oil money before they finally monetize another form of energy. 

As if a pipeline could be about friendship though lol. Unless you're one of the Wall St / Bay St guys.
8485 2018-02-10 19:39:35 Finally got our oil system fixed. Yay.
8486 2018-02-10 19:39:24 So ladies since coconut oil aint good for clear skin then what is? And keep the vague answers, I need examples/pictures lol
8487 2018-02-10 19:38:56 Right!  And the #Kurds think the oil fields will be in their hands ! FAT CHANCE!
8488 2018-02-10 19:38:50 Did you talk about selling your vote for #TaxScamBill so big oil could destroy ANWR?
8489 2018-02-10 19:38:44 This man get on my ass every time I get an oil change, I be being lazy af 
8490 2018-02-10 19:38:32 And the Bishop has some snake oil to sell you.
8491 2018-02-10 19:38:27 3 possible ranges : 
5.1K-5.5K
3.1K 3.4K
2.3K 
From there it completes the correction ( we test 2x the bottom ) and we bounce
During same time : stock market will bleed. Oil will be under pressure, not good for stocks. Stock deserves 35%-50% correction.
Wait & See.
8492 2018-02-10 19:38:18 คนข้างๆตกใจเลย 555
8493 2018-02-10 19:37:54 改造は全部埋める必要はないですよ〜

8496 2018-02-10 19:37:18 it prevents oil and bare skin from smudging on both paper and art tablets. I have a really bad habit of dragging my wrist and palm across as I'm drawing.
8497 2018-02-10 19:36:54 I Luv Vodka!  Spritzer for your linens: 1c Vodka + 1c H2O + 16 drops essential oil: to disinfect & freshen
8498 2018-02-10 19:36:54 Those oil barrels are blocking your path!
8499 2018-02-10 19:36:53 And Venezuela has more oil.
8500 2018-02-10 19:36:43 Lower east side? Go to hot kitchen ask for sliced fish with chili oil, double cooked pork, Sichuan dumplings, and lamb ribs will change your life
8501 2018-02-10 19:36:39 Calpol

8502 2018-02-10 19:36:38 Literally just spent over $200 in birthday gifts, got an oil change, got my car washed, put gas, and paid my credit card. And my income tax hasn't even dropped yet. My debit card is tired today 
8503 2018-02-10 19:36:25 Cuba also down to sanctions. Venezuela because of manipulation of oil price. And on and on
8504 2018-02-10 19:36:24 อยู่คอน g19 สัญญาณโทรศัพท์ก็ไม่เป็นใจ แค่คนส่งฉากจูบมาให้ดูเท่านั้นแหล่ะ อิพวกนี้กรี๊ดลั่น เค้านึกว่ากรี๊ดพี่ตูน เปล่ากรี๊ดฉากจูบ #sotusStheseries #ทีมย้อนหลัง
8505 2018-02-10 19:36:20 I've spent years at sea and witnessed the garbage everyday. I have designed hulls that will sweep up oil spills and garbage. Help me #savetheplanet #cleanoceans
8506 2018-02-10 19:36:17 We have to subsidize the petroleum industry to allow it time to take over from the entrenched whale oil lobby.
8507 2018-02-10 19:36:07 Ok.  Now overllay oil.  For the past 14 days.
8508 2018-02-10 19:36:06 At least 2-3x a week I have the upper middle class middle aged white lady looking for chips without oil, salt, dairy, wheat, corn, nuts, beans, seeds, carbs, or grains of any sort while being baked-not fried. THAT CANNOT POSSIBLY. EXIST. Accept the fact that you cant have chips.
8509 2018-02-10 19:35:58 Quite - but there is always a market for snake oil.
8510 2018-02-10 19:35:58 Aloe Vera juice and coconut oil does nothing for my 4b hair. Moisturization my ass.
8511 2018-02-10 19:35:54 The enemy of my enemy is  my enemy's enemy, no more, no less.
8512 2018-02-10 19:35:38 And in case you want to buy some snake oil, Boris could possibly recommend some merchants
8513 2018-02-10 19:35:23 Don't mean to make you a convert. I am not n apologist for the oil industry here. I have seen the filth other countries have for an oil industry - no comparison to Canada. Still, too many over entitled fat cats at the top. It is fishy agreed. You didnt make cheap shots - sorry.
8514 2018-02-10 19:35:17 @CiovaccoCapital It’s also interesting that energy and oil have sold off hard during the recent correction.  Tech & financials have sold off the least.  I’m not seeing commodities (& related) lead like 2002-08.  Your thoughts?
8515 2018-02-10 19:35:06 Is it oil or ice ?
8516 2018-02-10 19:35:05 You would want me to mix you an elixir of essential oil blends. You would not want me to... #THEGypsyQueen 
8517 2018-02-10 19:35:00 Why are all vine compilations on YouTube titled stuff like “VINES FOR MY HIGH COWORKERS”, “Vines To Watch When I’m Left Behind During The Rapture”, and “Vines to taunt my sister’s killer before I break his legs with a cricket bat and pour hot oil in his eyes” ?
8518 2018-02-10 19:34:44 ROUND 6: Japan announces oil and gas development in gas fields in East China Sea
8519 2018-02-10 19:34:35 With a hint of garlic and spices, olive oil & lemon juice, that’s sexy.
8520 2018-02-10 19:34:20 Update regarding oil tanker... full A1 closure northbound... stay safe. Will tweet once the closure if lifted.
8521 2018-02-10 19:34:10 ,a country where the VC of a uni. enjoys the same standard of living as an oil sheikh yet his institution cannot make the top 1000
8522 2018-02-10 19:33:57 Oil comes from prehistoric plants, not dinosaurs. So....
8523 2018-02-10 19:33:56 I couldn’t believe it mate, absolute shite fan base, problem with the oil money, no real fans, only youngsters used to winning, sad really!! He’d get it any team In world football 
8524 2018-02-10 19:33:54 *dad hands me my keys, and BBQ plate*  and he goes.....
"Happy early Valentine's Day" 

Oil change 
Full tank of gas 
My ford washed 
My tummy is full 

8525 2018-02-10 19:33:50 I wonder if enough time has elapsed that we humans have become oil. If so, perhaps that's why the middle east is so rich in it.
8526 2018-02-10 19:33:49 The SWF is purely down to oil
8527 2018-02-10 19:33:46 Lmao. Yeah. And then they try to be sneaky when they tell u if u want to included oil changes, and all this other stuff for like $90 more and u say no and they go down to $25
8528 2018-02-10 19:33:17 if you go against Alberta's bitumen you're attacking Canada, what about all that talk on the Carbon Tax hmm Jason? Weren't so Canadian focused then so what changed? Possibly that its you that might lose some revenue for a texan oil company? Could that be it?
8529 2018-02-10 19:33:15 Trump 3-D Chess.  Calling for a Military Parade as a strategy to openly expose that the US is run by the Military Industrial Complex? Maybe they can parade some war captives and captured booty (aka Oil drums and Banker loans)
8530 2018-02-10 19:32:55 Errbody need to get their oil  cause this wasn't an ordinary conflict of interest. Only the anointing will take this victory! (Isa10:27)
8531 2018-02-10 19:32:48 Mark 14:3 Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of costly aromatic oil from pure nard. After breaking open the jar, she poured it on his head.

8535 2018-02-10 19:32:14 my boyfriend like fries them with some olive oil, puts the meat and cheese in them, and then he wraps them in foil!
8536 2018-02-10 19:31:20 I do. Little piece of each with wedges with southern fried seasoning and garlic olive oil and salad.
8537 2018-02-10 19:31:01 beats me, Oil/Energy stocks are a really hard industry in my opinion
8538 2018-02-10 19:30:48 呟いたら出る法則な
8539 2018-02-10 19:30:42 Yes good weekend ..everybody is playing the zionist games , soon whole europe will join the zionist games , the winner gets a oil pipeline to mediteranian sea and Opium control .. welcome to the NWO , but dont forget the Newton law , action = reaction

8544 2018-02-10 19:30:17 Settle down! If those oil sales stop then you’ll be back to playing Jamie Pollock and Ian Bishop.
8545 2018-02-10 19:30:07 Your beard looks like 80’s porn pubes
8546 2018-02-10 19:30:01 Dear Mr. Trump  I believe you are a great leader. Our family's depend on your leadership . Its time to let go of oil for energy , and be a leader in solar and wind generator , Before not after its to late. Your a smart man , do the right thing.

8551 2018-02-10 19:29:21 Yeah, and who reversed that coup in 2002? Poor Venezuelans. But the Western media does not talk about that simply because it does not fit their entirely fabricated narrative on Venezuela. To the Western media, the US must steal Venezuela's oil at all costs.
8552 2018-02-10 19:29:19 Send your oil back east so we don’t have to import from Saudi Arabia  Quit funding Terrorist
8553 2018-02-10 19:29:18 yes, so his big oil buddies can squeeze out the last drop of crude before clean energy takes over and if they destroy the country doing it-they will just take their profits to a country that did give a shit about the environment.
8554 2018-02-10 19:29:09 The Fuhrer back at the Wolf's Lair, more concerned about the lack of progress of Army Group A toward the stated goal of the capture of the Caucasian oil fields, was enraged at this and what he considered "a  sportsman's stunt"
8555 2018-02-10 19:28:42 ambi!!! then I have witch hazel/tea tree oil in a spray bottle .... and I occasionally do organic raw honey masks
8556 2018-02-10 19:28:38 This beggars belief exploration has found oil under Lake Albert in Africa. UN talk some sense in2 them. Locals promised development but it's being withheld as a lever 2 get at the oil. 1 (ONE) water pump in whole prefab village! Rip off!
8557 2018-02-10 19:28:37 Buy the cooking oil and download the pirated PDF online 
8558 2018-02-10 19:28:33 Berrones has been living in the U.S. since he was 1½, when his parents brought him here in 1989. In 2006 he was caught driving with a fake license and deported to Mexico. He then twice re-entered the country unlawfully. #HeBroughtItOnHimself
8559 2018-02-10 19:28:24 Stupid twitter bio: "If humans can turn gas, coal and oil into fuel and CO2, it shouldn't be too hard to reverse the process"

Alright mate, here's a rusted through sword, please turn it back into a proper iron sword

Here's a cake, please turn it back into its ingredients.
8560 2018-02-10 19:28:05 Bhai aaj dollar 64 hai

8561 2018-02-10 19:27:51 Wow there's Oil & Gas but Ordinary Nigerians get nothing but an Ass-Whooping.
8562 2018-02-10 19:27:49 I am using CBD oil
8563 2018-02-10 19:27:44 I leave a box on my porch with computer programming manuals, candy, toilet pucks for refreshment and massage oil for relaxation. 9 in 10 violent criminals are looking for these items anyway.
8564 2018-02-10 19:27:43 See that you do. You might add some linseed oil to that mixture, [She appeared to be satisfied, until she added] And Kili, do not take my best copper stock pot for anything you might have in your pocket.
8565 2018-02-10 19:27:43 He should learn the history (recent history) of BC oil spills before speaking on the radio.
8566 2018-02-10 19:27:40 Syrian war has been dragging on since 2011. Sad that war rhetoric is the only thing that pushes oil prices up.
8567 2018-02-10 19:27:35 Yes they will. There is no good reason to support independence, though.
8568 2018-02-10 19:27:32 Social media has made me realize how many conspiracy theorist are out there. Just put coconut oil on your head & drink a bunch of apple cider vinegar & bam! Mumps is gone  vaccines are the devil, Bobby
8569 2018-02-10 19:27:16 Wow...looks like SJW’s need to start another “conversation”...female on male domestic violence !! Another “movement”
Twitter never lets me down 
8570 2018-02-10 19:27:12 still plausible by *any* means, and sadly it is. It could be done via oil and gas, but probably the larger issue is carbon cycle feedbacks largely missing from the models. Most notably, permafrost behavior has been a nasty surprise and looks set to be a nastier one going forward,
8571 2018-02-10 19:27:11 กูโดดเดี่ยวมาก เหมือนทุกคนได้เจอยุนอา แล้วกูมาทำเหี้ยไรที่ดอย อิเหี้ยยยยยย โคตรเศร้า
8572 2018-02-10 19:27:07 Environmental services , emergency oil spills that type stuff
8573 2018-02-10 19:27:07 Sadder yet those two countries kept in poverty as green weenie elites from UN, foreign orgs restrict their use their oil and gas for their own energy use - they try to force useless wind,,solar on them - keep them poor, uneducated, unhealthy
8574 2018-02-10 19:26:51 Only those who drown in the oil can somewhat understand

8577 2018-02-10 19:26:36 i used cannabutter instead of oil to cook some tajine
8578 2018-02-10 19:26:35 Probably better just schedule change oil through regular service dept...this quick lube Service is not so quick! 1:30 n still waiting! 
8579 2018-02-10 19:26:31 Nice and busy morning today! Got an oil change, hit the gym, washed the car in and out! Now time to relax. 
8580 2018-02-10 19:26:15 We could have done better thn Trump for sure. Acting like this is just now a problem bcse you hate Trump is just dumb. It was a mess before
8581 2018-02-10 19:26:03 tbh that doesn't sound awful (for the melanesian people, not so much for the mining/palm oil companies)
8582 2018-02-10 19:25:54 Iran gets involved,oil shoots up
8583 2018-02-10 19:25:54 I take most of these everyday:

-Green tea
-Dandelion
-Stinging needle
-Adderall or Modafinil
-Phenibut
-Fish oil
-Multivitamin
-Creatine
-Valerian root 
-Caffeine
-Nicotine chewing gum

Hey, health is the #1 priority 
8584 2018-02-10 19:25:53 Congratulations to the Geology dept University of Maiduguri on the release of our lecturers who were kidnapped by BH on an assignment in the search for oil and gas in the Nigerian sector of the Chad Basin! And to those who lost their lives during the battle may their souls RIP
8585 2018-02-10 19:25:46 I've seen the vast Palm Oil plantations across vast swaths of Borneo with my own eyes. Really, very, very bad

8588 2018-02-10 19:25:26 But, but…I thought we were going to have roaring inflation and the necessity for the Fed to raise interest rates 4 times in 2018. If we have roaring inflation, doesn’t that mean the oil price goes up? Which would be good for $FANG and other oil stocks?
8589 2018-02-10 19:25:16 Absolutely delighted to be reading 'The Cruel Oil', my short story featuring Dr. Anne Travers from #DoctorWho, at the @ArtsCentreEHU, Edge Hill University on Tuesday 13th - right during the 50th anniversary of her debut in 'The Web of Fear' as well!
8590 2018-02-10 19:25:11 Oil will eventually become a long-term stranded asset like coal thanks to global policies. Mitigating climate change via the Paris Accords will determine the energy sector's future.
8591 2018-02-10 19:25:01 The protesters are smart. They know JT, like Hussein Barack Obama, loves to play to the gallery of pseudo-environmentalists even if it means the economy of Canada’s cash cow province, Alberta will go under.  He subsidizes Bombardier, but take oil sands money.
8592 2018-02-10 19:24:59 Sir Congratulations to ONGC -India to acquires 10% Stake in UAE's oil offshore concession. Definitely, ONGC will achieve Thr Good Target regarding Thr professional oil fields Mktg & business. Wishing all Success to ONGC. Rgds.
8593 2018-02-10 19:24:52 The chrome paint pots are loose pigments! You can mix them with an oil for a wet look 
8594 2018-02-10 19:24:49 You ppl should do thorough investigation beyond reasonable doubt before finally condemning that acct.
8595 2018-02-10 19:24:46 @stephrklover I forgot to update you on the charcoal/coconut oil toothpaste. It's legit omg. It's not as "pasty" or foamy as regular toothpaste is. It's also not that strong in the mint flavor/scent, but it really works in whitening omg
8596 2018-02-10 19:24:37 To them it's not about #RuleOfLaw but always #DepthOfFeeling

8597 2018-02-10 19:24:34 Internally.. not sure. But you could use something like bee balm or a natural oil like coconut or rosehip?

8600 2018-02-10 19:24:10 Oh and the dependence on foreign fuel is also a lie, the US is the biggest or one of the biggest oil producing countries on the planet.
8601 2018-02-10 19:23:58 For a while now I've wanted to start up a patient services centre, with access to education, grow space, oil makers, rosin presses and affordable lab testing. But with the laws the way they are, I'd be promptly shut down and probably jailed.
8602 2018-02-10 19:23:58 Seen oil tankers turn quicker
8603 2018-02-10 19:23:58 My tax cut has been swallowed up by the price gouging at the pump. @POTUS must address the big oil companies.

Are you *trying* to get sued for libel? 

Any comment, Mr Housakos?
8614 2018-02-10 19:22:55 British tolerated slavery in Africa through late 19th c. It fueled the production they were there to profit off e.g. palm oil for industrial lubricants, even as they outlawed it in territories they controlled directly.
8615 2018-02-10 19:22:53 Is Branch still working for the Nation? Since her outburst on oil I cared little about her.
8616 2018-02-10 19:22:50 Maureen, I’m gonna need you to teach me everything you know about the benefits of emu oil and it’s no doubt upsetting harvesting process
8617 2018-02-10 19:22:46 Well it was either the CIA or Mossad. It was Cheney either way.
And yep, Saddam refused to do an "Oil for Guns" deal after the Iran-Iraq War circa 1989, like the Saudis had done with Kissinger to set up the Petrodollar system circa 1974.
8618 2018-02-10 19:22:42 Don't forget to vote for Alex and Maggie since they're in with Oil city
8619 2018-02-10 19:22:42 Give it up. American ppl will never support it. No reason to.
8620 2018-02-10 19:22:42 Adulting is getting extremely excited over finding a stain remover that gets 3 months old oil stains out of your carpet, then texting your boyfriend and sister about it and then getting equally as excited about it.
8621 2018-02-10 19:22:39 Instead of oil I put cut up bacon in with the fries. I know it must be bad for me but I just don't care ... bacon fries.
8622 2018-02-10 19:22:23 "Too long" meaning that it doesn't fit with your fabricated narrative, so you will just have to ignore the fact that so many poor Venezuelans forced Chavez back into power and the US plot to steal Venezuela's oil failed yet again?
8623 2018-02-10 19:22:16 I made pudding pops in one of my ice cube trays like they recommended and there is still oil trapped in the crevices. I think they just keep buying more.
8624 2018-02-10 19:21:45 Thanks for the information. I didn't  get same impression from 'popular' media. The narrative seems to be that proportion of non oil exports went up because Oil export receipts dropped. Also very many complaints about 'shutting shop' due to lack of raw materials and equipment.
8625 2018-02-10 19:21:42 My Grandfather had a cancer on his ear. The church prayed for him, James 5, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. The cancer dried up completely. He lived at least 20 more years cancer free. Would that be a miracle?

8629 2018-02-10 19:21:21 Posh in my house. Make my own dressing. Classic olive oil, mustard and white vinegar.

8631 2018-02-10 19:21:12 Kenya's wagalla was the worst holocaust in E. Africa. In 1963 #NFD Referendum 97% of these people voted to join #Somalia on 12/12/1963 but 10 Downing Street changed the course after assassination of JFK. Today #SomaOilandGas co-owned by Cameron owns 62K sq2 of oil rich in Somalia

8633 2018-02-10 19:20:58 I'm getting my oil changed then i'm spending the rest of the day outside because it's GORGEOUS 
8634 2018-02-10 19:20:53 Market will continue to focus on growth, as it has over-performed in low inflation.  Don't fix what ain't broken, normal human behaviour.  Eventually inflation will erode forward looking revenue projections, and hit SP.  Demand driven inflation is a call on oil, always.  3/
8635 2018-02-10 19:20:48 Most likely not I'm afraid: they preen to try and clean themselves and end up ingesting the oil; they can be cleaned up but need to be caught which isn't easy before it's probably too late.
8636 2018-02-10 19:20:40 It wasn’t a rescue mission. They failed to rescue them.

I’d rather they carry out risk assessments before sending people to prospect oil in a volatile zone.

8639 2018-02-10 19:20:04 oh, we have. the oil industry keeps squashing the research tho
8640 2018-02-10 19:19:22 Is that why poor Venezuelans forced Chavez back into power after the US coup for the plot to steal Venezuela's oil?
8641 2018-02-10 19:19:22 How will the #environment be safer? They will use ships to transport that oil.

8658 2018-02-10 19:16:25 I was going to drop my car off to get the oil changed at this place in Huntsville bc they were running a special and they tried to tell me my car would only take synthetic oil (so I would pay more). Jokes on u sir, this woman used to work at a Ford dealership :-)
8659 2018-02-10 19:16:05 4 prospects in one day , still 2 weeks to go . 

For non-petroleum a prospect is the place where you can find oil or gas in the subsurface.
8660 2018-02-10 19:15:54 Yes big oil is a part of the green blob due to a great opportunity to take market shares from the coal industry. 10 CEO's from BG Group, BP, Eni, Pemex, Reliance Industries, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Statoil and Total in favour of the Paris agreement.
8661 2018-02-10 19:15:44 Ya ive been thinking about that too. In a way it's also almost feels hypocritical to be so disgusted by oil production methods when they are only doing so cause, for example, I would like some fuel in my car lol #Lesson5

8666 2018-02-10 19:14:50 I didn't say that, I said that government are not moved by religion, masses are. As a political leader if you want people to follow you, you have to speak a language they can understand, that lan6is religious attrition and not oil competition

8671 2018-02-10 19:14:15 Don’t need one lol. Just mix some oil together, warm it up, rub it in, let it sit, then rinse it out.
8672 2018-02-10 19:14:14 i’m w my dad buying oil filters for the car, and he was confused bc they had two recommended but they were dif sizes, and the dude working there was like, “we are men we don’t measure by the size” UHHHHHHHhhhhHhHhHh
8673 2018-02-10 19:14:05 #GasPrices Oil company scam! Americans are seeing less #taxes taken out of their #paychecks but now gas prices are being raised. So, the less tax taken out of paychecks is going right into gas tanks.

8684 2018-02-10 19:11:55 You are conflating antecedent with impact.  Oil worries did not spur market sell-off, that would be inverse to impact.  If oil dropping, inflation drops, rates stabilize, forward earnings remain unconstrained by inflation worries. Inflation worries drove selling.  1/
8685 2018-02-10 19:11:49 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
8686 2018-02-10 19:11:48 The guy who did my oil change this morning looked like Lee Harvey Oswald after the Dallas PD had roughed him up a little.
8687 2018-02-10 19:11:20 Uss conditioner instead of shampoo or bar soap. Shampoo dries out the oil and makes ya beard dry and brittle
8688 2018-02-10 19:10:39 Picky.
8689 2018-02-10 19:10:18 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
8690 2018-02-10 19:10:14 What about milk ? Or Oil ? Or electricity ?
8691 2018-02-10 19:10:03 Almost. 
3. Don't spend the $$ on services, but rather invest it on new and productive industries to replace the oil revenues in due course.
8692 2018-02-10 19:10:00 Nivea generally. Plus generous amount of oils of life - body shop and nivea before bed + undereye oil  n cream cz I have dark circles
8693 2018-02-10 19:09:48 Who told u?
China's largest import is oil so u think america gives them oil?
Moreover iran is fucking better than anyone else...
8694 2018-02-10 19:09:39 Used it and the breakout was horrific. The lotion and oil was amazing though.
8695 2018-02-10 19:09:26 CBD Oil is lifeeeeee
8696 2018-02-10 19:09:12 Walked in for a $70 oil change, walked out with a $400 bill. They really be finessing me man
8697 2018-02-10 19:08:58 Washing seemed to make it worse! Human ended up applying a sort of diy yogurt & oat face mask. Believing the alkalinity should counteract the firey chilli oil. Which it did. 
I got to lick the yogurt pot; which was an unexpected bonus
8698 2018-02-10 19:08:51 For how long? Oil will run out. Then what? Plan ahead.
8699 2018-02-10 19:08:36 coconut oil and peppermint oil hair treatment - grow hair growwww. if anyone has tried these and seen great benefits please let me know so i know there's hope!!
8700 2018-02-10 19:08:23 Finally off work with 2 hours of sleep! Now all I want is a nice booty massage later with some coconut oil so I can sleep peacefully 
8701 2018-02-10 19:08:10 Using a sugar scrub right after shaving will have your skin feeling immaculate...throw in a coconut oil rub down afterwards?? Listen. That trio is undefeated.
8702 2018-02-10 19:08:00 Why is my radio so staticky, why does 7-11 always smell like dirty oil, and why does the ATM have spots after the decimal if it doesn’t even register you inputting numbers there? I mean, I almost just withdrew $4000.
8703 2018-02-10 19:07:46 That's true but ongoing weakness of oil is not related with strong dollar, it's just linked with shale story of US.

8705 2018-02-10 19:07:25 @MSNBC I am so worried about DACA DREAMERS & their families. I grew up in El Paso, Texas. Heavy Hispanic Community above 80% & directly on major border crossing. It is rated safest city & best places to live in the entire United States. Republican has the facts wrong. #DACADeal
8706 2018-02-10 19:07:18 Many years ago I visited a small island in the Finnish archipelago. In the tiny local store they had 10 different olive oils. You would be lucky to find any olive oil in a similar store in Norway.
8707 2018-02-10 19:07:09 Good evening everyone. Today is jazz night. Come and taste our delicious Risotto with wild porcini mushrooms, truffle oil and Parmesan cheese. #Bermondsey#ElephantandCastle#Borough#Londonbridge

8709 2018-02-10 19:06:58 So the only time you show face here in The Deen is for conferences and freebies. Where were you when 10s of thousands were losing their jobs when then oil industry went into crisis?
8710 2018-02-10 19:06:44 If Scotland was a Independent country between the years 2008 and 2014 we would have been 8.3 Billion better off 
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE & REVENUE SCOTLAND published by both governments come to the same conclusion. 
With the Oil price rising along side Brexit its time to get out
8711 2018-02-10 19:06:30 I don't like this political move... But - as we both know - politics and war is a dirty business... Yes - Russia is using Turkey to pressure YPG to talks with Damascus and try to weaken NATO in north Syria... and a logical move. Like the occupation of oil fields by US SDF.
8712 2018-02-10 19:06:25 Justice served. Shocking decision to award the pen. Great tackle Dunk, but Adam has the speed of an oil tanker though 
8713 2018-02-10 19:06:19 How funny. I just got back from a walk and during said walk I kept thinking of the Porky & Gabby cartoon involving digging for oil.
8714 2018-02-10 19:06:19 We don’t want your dirty sludge going through our pristine mountains, lush forests, or sensitive coastlines. The risk is not worth it. 

We suggest you leave the oil in the ground and switch to renewables and green energy.

Also: Banning BC wines is petty and childish.

8717 2018-02-10 19:05:59 we stole this land! you can not steal it back! we are the junkyard dog to the west's oil empire, so we dgaf.
8718 2018-02-10 19:05:56 そうです。うちにあったのが "in sunflower oil" だったので、さすがにオイルは半分以上捨てましたが、ちょっと油が入ったせいか、普段のご飯より艶っとふっくらという感じに炊き上がりましたよ。
8719 2018-02-10 19:05:46 Of course, everyone except suckers and morons knows that he's a fast-talking, blowhard con and a spoiled, lazy, overstuffed moron.

The problem is there are a lot of suckers and morons out there still buying the snake oil, while the smarter folks can smell the con.
8720 2018-02-10 19:05:43 I just noticed by delivering at 41 weeks my baby not gone be a Aquarius. 
Let me go get some castro oil and induce myself

8722 2018-02-10 19:05:11 I'd look up GDP per capita to see how Norway and the USA compare but I suspect it will not help their case. Also, that oil revenue goes to support a nation sovereign wealth fund that would never be allowed in the USA.

8727 2018-02-10 19:04:36 I nearly walked out of this job not even an hour after being here. Please GM, push my buttons. Please sales associates, try me. 

I’ll spill oil and key every damn car here and not give a shit.

You’re also still paying for my traffic ticket I got transporting your shit cars.

8729 2018-02-10 19:04:33 Managed to change the air filter in the car and replace all the wiper blades. Now I just need to get the oil changed, but the cold weather outside makes me want to not do stuff.
8730 2018-02-10 19:04:22 Sure with your choice of massage oil. :)
8731 2018-02-10 19:04:21 My dad said I need to go get my oil change and my bank account had a heart attack
8732 2018-02-10 19:04:20 Cleansing wipes don’t effectively clean the skin, they just smear dirt, bacteria, oil, and makeup across it. Cleansing agents are designed to break down debris, but it’s the rinsing action from water that actually removes it.

8735 2018-02-10 19:03:37 Having to adult and getting my oil changed at an actual place is weird... So used to Chris doing it. Such a weird feeling. He'd be so pissed at me if he knew how long it's been
8736 2018-02-10 19:03:28 Both produce prods based upon supply and demand.  When that dynamic becomes irrelevant, so is the analogy.  If Apple over-prods, they reduce margins, in effort to recover capital costs.  Same with oil.  Nobody expects Apple to ignore supply/demand, but do expect E&P's to do so.
8737 2018-02-10 19:03:25 This is what I fear the most from Trump dictatorship.  Let's face it, we're officially in early stages.  Land damaged from oil industry is never the same & takes years to remediate.
8738 2018-02-10 19:03:24 Playing 2 oil tankers who both want to play the Hollywood ball doesn’t work.. you’ve got to have energy in there somewhere!
8739 2018-02-10 19:03:19 You think it was from what, like a different oil? That’s the worst cover in the world “ugh sorry guys, my backpack is oily from...uh... emu oil, yeah that’s right, oil from emus.”
8740 2018-02-10 19:03:13 I’ve already got Krazy Glue stuck on my fingers. The Swedish fish have some type of oil on them. I’m trying to wipe them off as I glue them.
8741 2018-02-10 19:03:10 Nice save! It much have been oil on track 
8742 2018-02-10 19:03:06 Hate getting my oil changed  if it wasn’t cold I’d do this shit myself

8746 2018-02-10 19:01:56 Oil led the market lower twice this week. Direct impact on S&P earnings and USD (which affects tech earnings). You can see it in relative sector performance. It was also interesting to see energy equity weakness before crude selloff

8751 2018-02-10 19:00:45 You mean the 27th poorest state? Below pretty much all the NE seaboard. Even including the oil and shipping industries in Texas.
8752 2018-02-10 19:00:42 Nah, we're still failed states. An economy can't be based on one thing. Oil or otherwise...
8753 2018-02-10 19:00:39 I have only 1 child, she's 9, she's by far smarter than me, stop taking what people tell you, start asking why. Why are we here, until 2017, we were the highest importer of Rice, today, we are the 7th biggest producer of Rice. Edo is reinvigorating their oil palm plantation. WHY?

8760 2018-02-10 18:59:41 Israel is a military outpost in the Middle East for the financial considerations of the Council of Foreign Relations and this is all just another set up for stealing land and oil.
8761 2018-02-10 18:59:41 Canada is far more than just oil.  So glad @AJWVictoriaBC and @jjhorgan are placing Canadians' future ahead of revenue from a dying #fossilfuel industry. #gmg4c #climatechange #stopkm

8777 2018-02-10 18:57:32 A bunch of water. Everyone reacts differently to different products. Everything pretty much works for me but I’d say use a really moisturizer for your chin and wash your face every night. Since it seems the oil is clogging on your chin.

8779 2018-02-10 18:57:08 The cons of the camera are poor contrast and extreme oil painting effect.

8780 2018-02-10 18:57:06 Today I ate leisurely ate breakfast, shoveled/scraped my car out of over a foot of snow, sipped coffee, went to the gym, dropped my car off for an oil change and new wipers, ate lunch at an even more leisurely pace, sipped more coffee, and am working on plans. I‘m SUCH an adult.

8787 2018-02-10 18:55:51 I *make* hot sauce. 
The best method I’ve found for getting it off your hands is rubs them in oil and then the same amount of washing up liquid. 
Work it in and rinse off.
8788 2018-02-10 18:55:41 So it’s better to say that governments had to give citizens vouchers so they could afford fuel. Basically people had to be paid to use it. Oil industry happy either way and making trillions of $. Following the money.
8789 2018-02-10 18:55:39 I can’t believe I have to explain this again... presidents do not control the price of gas. There’s numerous factors that figure into the price of crude oil and gas. Some are due to economic reasons, but that’s not all. Stop giving credit to presidents.

8804 2018-02-10 18:54:03 The irony in your statement: Vancouver residents are purchasers of Alberta oil. The benefits work both ways. Each province is dependent on the other.
8805 2018-02-10 18:53:56 4th largest deposit of oil on the planet, in a nation that respects rule of law & human rights, and has a reasonably good level of care for the environment.  Most countries that need oil would rather buy from us vs a dictatorship.

8819 2018-02-10 18:51:15 Fundamentally, oil is too low, per present environment.  Some will forecast shale prod overwhelming demand, and time will tell.  Thus, forward looking, either shale overwhelms, or OPEC under-delivers.  Make your bets, present price/data irrelevant, as caught in DOW gravity pull.
8820 2018-02-10 18:50:56 If an essential oil smells bad, then that means your body is lacking that nutrients. So does food work the same?
8821 2018-02-10 18:50:54 Yeah... just made verbal sound effects for the game I play on my phone, while sitting in the waiting room at the oil change place. I’m proud.
8822 2018-02-10 18:50:49 I learned how to reset my oil change dashboard thing on my own so there is no stopping me now
8823 2018-02-10 18:50:37 cheap oil
8824 2018-02-10 18:50:21 @WoodMackenzie  Successful like the Montney but oil and gas takeaway is still the elephant in the room
8825 2018-02-10 18:50:13 So why do we keep buying Saudi Oil? Besides being a regressive dictatorship that murders women for being raped and stones gay people to death, we are screwing over our energy workers. Harper did it. Trudeau does it. Will you speak up against this ??
8826 2018-02-10 18:50:09 Very true, Russia should be more economically stable and bounce back from western economic manipulation mainly in oil and gas market prices
8827 2018-02-10 18:50:02 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
8828 2018-02-10 18:50:01 Climate change is bad, for oil jobs. guns are good, for the NRA. opioids are good, for big pharma. Universal Healthcare is bad, for insurance companies. Immigration is bad, for republican votes, prisons are good, for republican votes. Min wage is bad, for billionaire CEOs.
8829 2018-02-10 18:49:49 ExxonMobil adds 2.7 Bboe of proved O&G reserves in 2017, replacing 183% of production > ExxonMobil's proved reserves totaled 21.2 Bboe at year-end 2017. Company’s reserves life at current production rates = 14 years #Oil #exxonmobil #economics #business
8830 2018-02-10 18:49:36 Climate change is bad, for oil jobs. guns are good, for the NRA. opioids are good, for big pharma. Universal Healthcare is bad, for insurance companies. Immigration is bad, for republican votes, prisons are good, for republican votes. Min wage is bad, for billionaire CEOs.
8831 2018-02-10 18:49:33 Getting an oil change
8832 2018-02-10 18:49:30 this is the first time i’ve ever gone to valvoline for my oil change. and i am SO IMPRESSED.
8833 2018-02-10 18:49:29 An unspoiled #BC coastline is also in the #national interest of #Canada #pipeline #oil #TMX #kindermorgan #BCwine
8834 2018-02-10 18:49:00 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
8835 2018-02-10 18:48:59  maybe you should have diversified your economy?
We will need to move away from oil, and the sooner you get with the movement the sooner you can recover from losses
8836 2018-02-10 18:48:58 .@MrBlackmans Copped some of your phenomenal Grapefruit Beard Oil and Beard Balm today, but I can't help but noticing you don't sell beard shampoo or conditioner! 

What shampoo & conditioner would you recommend? 
8837 2018-02-10 18:48:43 僕の中でデジモンみたいな奴ですねｗ
8838 2018-02-10 18:48:24 Getting my oil changed before I blow my car up 
8839 2018-02-10 18:48:10 I got 3tbsp butter and melted it w 2 tbsp of Olive oil. Minced up a few garlic cloves and let it simmer. Then added 2 cups heavy cream and about a cup of Parmesan and let it simmer, and once it starts to thicken up a bit add mozzarella slowly. Take it off heat. Stir throughout!
8840 2018-02-10 18:48:08 I knowwwww  but it would flourish more if had a hydration treatment with jojoba oil lol 
8841 2018-02-10 18:48:02 Total-led consortium enters Lebanon w/ 2 deepwater E&P contracts < Total (operator, 40%), ENI (40%) & Novatek (20%) #Oil #lebanon #total #eni #novatek
8842 2018-02-10 18:47:52 Lemme apply some coconut oil
8843 2018-02-10 18:47:30 Castor oil taste like some shit you would put in your hair 
8844 2018-02-10 18:47:16 And even when #DGOC has done some Drilling they have 100% record of hitting Gas/Oil - that's nuts.
8845 2018-02-10 18:47:11 I wish my grandad was up here he would’ve changed my oil for me
8846 2018-02-10 18:47:09 Such a trash president has no respect to human life..stealing arab oil and wants to keep stealing iranian oil... but then all americans r as trashy animals  the world cant afford to have them no more
8847 2018-02-10 18:46:53 good point. But also with devalued dollar plan lower oil offsets hyperinflation if trying to help citizens.
8848 2018-02-10 18:46:53 accourding to nostradamus world war III will start from a ship and because of the oil and gas findings south of Cyprus
8849 2018-02-10 18:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
8850 2018-02-10 18:45:48 Coconut Oil
8851 2018-02-10 18:45:32 Hmmm the way you say that I am thinking deep boiled in oil and crunchy but I am probably misrepresenting. Actually insects deep boiled in oil from experience are not too bad. Still, these guys are a bit big for such treatments.
8852 2018-02-10 18:45:27 Precisely. He supports people who shouldn't have any more wealth. Like oil companies that need no more money. They don't care about the planet or anyone's well being but they care about how many figures of numbers are in front of their name.
8853 2018-02-10 18:45:15 External factors : OPEC oil tariffs , being expelled from dollar-zone problem for Labour. So dollar problem nowt to do with £ or ‘ Marxism ‘ in fact Callaghan policies were monetarist sadly .
8854 2018-02-10 18:44:49 Never been happier to not see oil pouring from the bottom of my car 
8855 2018-02-10 18:44:41 did you forget the eggs?
or
the oil?
8856 2018-02-10 18:44:32 Huge congratulations to these outstanding two women - pole sitter @NatalieRacing and starting P5 @LeilaniMunter in today’s Lucas Oil 200 @DISupdates #ARCA #arcaracing #Daytona

Μήπως να μην ερχόταν τελικά? ??
8858 2018-02-10 18:44:09 Hey @NASCARONFOX @NASCAR 
U gonna add sime time 2 practice
Pretty uncool 2 take time awway because of OIL ON THE TRACK!!
8859 2018-02-10 18:44:08 getting an oil change at valvoline is so stressful. it’s just a bunch of incoherent yelling and then they come tell me 7 things wrong with my car
8860 2018-02-10 18:43:56 Yes, I love the dewy and smooth formula as well! I HATE the Loreal 24 hour coverage tube one. It looks so bad on me. It cakes up and it feels like oil on my face lol The pro-glow works best from me from that brand. Right now I am in love with my Fenty one but I use it sparingly!
8861 2018-02-10 18:43:53 My Current Focus with Crypto is finding Trade tokens Built to simplify international trade by a country so they can digitize their international trade Commodities.  Simply put CryptoCurrency backed by a Country's exportable commodities.  i.e. Oil, Diamonds, Natural Gas etc.
8862 2018-02-10 18:43:20 The oil they use when I get my eyebrows done makes my face itch so bad. Fml
8863 2018-02-10 18:43:12 How is he a paid spokesperson for the oil industry? Stupid comment
8864 2018-02-10 18:43:00 Al took me out last night and it was so nice since I haven't seen much of him this week . The comedy show was actually really fun ! And he wakes up this am to change my oil 
8865 2018-02-10 18:42:59 I haaaate eucalyptus and minty stuff but here I am diffusing an essential oil of those because I am desperate.
8866 2018-02-10 18:42:57 Skin routine:  I drink lots of water, don’t touch my face unless I’ve washed my hands first, coconut oil, witch hazel, noxzema, exfoliation, and cut people that cause stress
8867 2018-02-10 18:42:51 She say oil well 
Can you share your experience ???
8868 2018-02-10 18:42:49 Still feel horrible, but I took some cbd oil and st least the body ache is going away. Will probably just be on @SkyPrivate this afternoon and evening. I'm gonna eat first though. #Relaxed #CBD #fuckyousickness
8869 2018-02-10 18:42:38 Who dropped the oil? Or, judging by the clean up time, was it an oil rig that went up?
8870 2018-02-10 18:42:29 i have no idea the whole place is a hellscape but i do know there’s gonna be poached cold chicken w the garlic ginger scallion oil
8871 2018-02-10 18:42:05 Of course they would. They must subscribe to Oil Rig and Falicys shippers. If I were an Oliver/Laurel shipper I’d accept William because Laurel did like she did in the episode with Samantha. Just like I accept Hope and Hayley even tho I ship Klamille
8872 2018-02-10 18:41:58 Track is back green. @KevinHarvick did not put the oil down but they ran through it. Still unsure who put it down.
8873 2018-02-10 18:41:41 Just spoke to an old pal in Toronto. We talked about the BC-AB pipeline standoff in some detail. He asked thoughtful questions. I think he learned a couple of things. But he says he rarely hears a word about the oil indy's current woes in Toronto. Out of sight, out of mind.
8874 2018-02-10 18:41:39 We have come to a sad low in distrust of authority and scientific fact when people put questions like whether to get vaccinated to a vote on social media. It’s like asking my dog whether I need an oil change.
8875 2018-02-10 18:41:31 adding cbd oil to my water daily has changed my life, i really feel the difference in my overall mood and it helps my back pain so much. i love life.
8876 2018-02-10 18:41:29 For this sake - sioni. Unless some country with an interest pushes for it - like they needed when they pushed for SAPs to open our markets. Unless we price our oil in Euro or something like that - sioni them actively reading our constitution.
8877 2018-02-10 18:41:29 Made a hair mask w avocado & extra virgin olive oil my scalp feels so replenished 
8878 2018-02-10 18:41:27 So, explain your qualifications to claim bitumen is not low API crude oil. Pull it out of the fire: are u actually supporting the approach of upgrading and shipping lighter gravity product? And you can apologize for calling me a troll. You’re the one shooting your mouth off here.
8879 2018-02-10 18:41:25 It healthier to add oil to it. *making a face at the amount of calories you'd be adding with butter*
8880 2018-02-10 18:41:19 Went in for a oil change and found out i need front and back breaks 
8881 2018-02-10 18:41:16 I use an oil, then a light cream, a light leave in and then a anti breakage serum light spray
8882 2018-02-10 18:41:03 An oil baron is running the State Department. A Wall Street Executive is running Treasury. CDC director owned tobacco stock. And Education Secretary is dealing with over 100 conflicts of interest. So, when does this swamp draining start?
8883 2018-02-10 18:40:56 Actually Anthony that was the last time their oil fields even functioned properly.  Those companies employed thousands of Venezuelan engineers and workers.  Now the fields are decrepit and leaking.  #Venezuela was a rich beautiful nation.  No more
8884 2018-02-10 18:40:54 25k for a Bugatti oil change #ouch
8885 2018-02-10 18:40:51 my favorite things start with Cs: coffee, cannabis, carrots, cocoa, coconut oil,  cummings, cumming, critters, creatures
8886 2018-02-10 18:40:46 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
8887 2018-02-10 18:40:43 Estoy juzgando bien duro a esa gente que dice solo usar productos limpios pa pelo rizo y entre sus recomendaciones tienen cosas con silicones, mineral oil y hasta isopropyl alcohol. O seaaaaa
8888 2018-02-10 18:40:33 Come on Donnie... Corruption is your thing... if you got one thing going great for you, this is your thing... claim it. Don't give it away. Donnie, Donnie, Donnie...
8889 2018-02-10 18:40:21 Cleaned off my mom's car and my car. Pulled both of them out and shoveled entire driveway. Plus path to back door and oil tank. Work shortly. Then I'm on Vacation!!! Can't wait :-D #WinterBreak #NoWorkWeek #MaineLife
8890 2018-02-10 18:40:16 “gear oil is thicker than water” - mick joy
8891 2018-02-10 18:40:15 WHO LAYED THE OIL DOWN ON THE TRACK YALL ?
8892 2018-02-10 18:40:09 OMG. Are they LICKING the oil off the track??!! Speed it the hell up!! They need to practice since #nascar already took 1/2 of practice away!!!
8893 2018-02-10 18:40:08 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
8894 2018-02-10 18:39:57 I think he means the people who own land, water, oil, banks Etc
8895 2018-02-10 18:39:36 went back and bought sesame oil cuz this cursed kitchen didnt have any
8896 2018-02-10 18:39:35 Add oil to a fire.
8897 2018-02-10 18:39:31 I made pineapple muffins yesterday and used coconut oil instead of butter. They are SO good. 
8898 2018-02-10 18:39:29 Shah himself was a CIA plant, installed after overthrowing Mossadegh. But Shah later started asserting control over oil revenues
8899 2018-02-10 18:39:20 They need to get with the program. COAL is not a clean energy source. We don’t need more coal what we need is for the coal miners to be retrained in reusable energy sources. COAL and OIL are killing our planet and our people.
8900 2018-02-10 18:39:20 Well, there’s no metaphor there for me. I have no problem punching Nazis. Fuck anyone that says otherwise. Some of us were sent 8,000 miles away to kill brown people over nothing but oil interests. Now we’re supposed to stand by as fascists destroy our country? Fuck that.
8901 2018-02-10 18:39:19 Black soap works wonders. Also to keep my face clear I use facial tea tree oil daily. Only one squirt  And Congratulations Queen!
8902 2018-02-10 18:39:10 Also I definitely accidentally got baby oil in my hair last night #greasebeast
8903 2018-02-10 18:38:58 How do i air fry cauliflower w/o overbrowning/burning the florets? I've tried more oil, lower heat but nothing works. I get undercooked stalks, decimated florets. I may just stick to oven roasting.
8904 2018-02-10 18:38:48 Yes.I agree. That said, many factors act on oil prices. Now, greater US production seems to be the cause. Of course, I am also not an Expert at all.Any way. fall in oil prices is good for India, its Budget, deficit, and so on.
8905 2018-02-10 18:38:17 Unfortunately, am not like you, I judge leaders based on available resources, Nigeria is only trying to move from oil dependent economy, try to see things from a realist point of view, not like a dreamer. We can only move based on Available resources that we have. No magic please
8906 2018-02-10 18:37:50 Fuck you oil industry. My grandkids will be living in a fucking desert because of global warming.
8907 2018-02-10 18:37:46 Voy a ir al oil a comer una hamburguesa
8908 2018-02-10 18:37:30 Find someone to burnning the midnight oil like me

8911 2018-02-10 18:37:06 CBS OIL works very well.  I am 62 and have use it for a few years.  It is amazing.  I dont take "pills" like I use to.  Everyone with chronic pain really needs to at least give it a try.
8912 2018-02-10 18:36:47 มาเดินหน้ารามแล้วก้คิดถึงวันเก่าๆ
8913 2018-02-10 18:36:46 If you’ve never added a few drops of tea tree oil into the shower, do so today and thank me later.
8914 2018-02-10 18:36:44 I’m not a troll, I work in the oil industry, have producing properties. But you would wipe out my assets, destroy my ability to support myself and my family. So, though I’m supposed to want to bomb Iranians, Syrians, North Koreans back to the Stone Age, you are worse. #cdnpoli
8915 2018-02-10 18:36:38 Andrew Wilson destroyed the oil bonus myth.
8916 2018-02-10 18:36:34 Shea butter and tea tree oil gotta be two of the greatest inventions ever
8917 2018-02-10 18:36:14 Lol after each time you take your wig off wash, deep condition, moisturize and seal with oil. Your hair needs more attention then every 6 months
8918 2018-02-10 18:35:42 God is good ! free oil change and tire rotation

8920 2018-02-10 18:35:37 That would make sense, but not giving corporations a huge tax break wouldve made sense too. Im thinking trump will ask Russia for loans. He refuses to place sanctions for a reason and is all big on oil, just like Russia.
8921 2018-02-10 18:35:19 My man let me pay an oil change for my car and I felt like an adult 
8922 2018-02-10 18:35:10 I swear a ploy is in place to keep the majority uneducated so they'll have no choice but to work in the oil field. If the state leaders could, they would do away with education completely
8923 2018-02-10 18:35:06 About to partake in consuming some good, healthy amounts of oil, salt, and sugar... #CANTWAIT.

It’s #CheatDay y’all.
8924 2018-02-10 18:35:06 Dads changing my oil and I’m just praying he doesn’t get in my car for some dumb reason, bc it smells like straight gas & I’m not talking ab the kind that fuels ur car 
8925 2018-02-10 18:35:01 Possibly a new engine. Oil that’s protects everything burning off.
8926 2018-02-10 18:34:42 Finally getting my oil changed
8927 2018-02-10 18:34:38 My resting bitch face really helps me in life. Paul& I are waiting for his car's oil change& this woman randomly came up& started talking to him& gives no fucks that I'm here& I'm so happy
8928 2018-02-10 18:34:37 City have an injury crisis. Most other club's just get on with it. Not at oil city fc. Throw a 50 million pound note at it all the while cry to the refs association about tackles. Huddersfield thought mc tominay was a rugby player only last week.
8929 2018-02-10 18:34:36 Tune up? May need some oil.
8930 2018-02-10 18:34:23 My societal contribution today: while waiting for my car’s oil change, I ripped a “9/11 Was An Inside Job” and four “Info Wars” stickers off of public light poles as I walked around town. Fuck that propaganda.

#resist
8931 2018-02-10 18:34:22 Somebody lost a LOT of oil. Nearly ten minutes later and clean up is still going on in Daytona
8932 2018-02-10 18:34:20 But I use witch hazel (morning & night) & coconut oil
8933 2018-02-10 18:34:14 Can’t wait for these Arab gulf oil funded teams like Man City and PSG to die out
8934 2018-02-10 18:34:03 @Oprah, @WeightWatchers, you will both go down in history as promoters of fat oppression. As eugenicists. As sellers of snake oil. As hate mongers. It doesn't matter what people eat when you do such harm. #SaveOurTeens! #WakeUpWeightWatchers
8935 2018-02-10 18:33:52 Me three lol

But there’s some used snake oil that could use peddling. 
8936 2018-02-10 18:33:49 Oil and gas in Arabiya is a gift-sand storm is a curse-
8937 2018-02-10 18:33:47 Hemp has over 700 uses from Flour to Oil. Think BIG or go home! BPA Free Plastics, Clothing, Rope, even Plastic for Greenhouses. You make your own way and crying the blues just makes you seem feeble when Aboriginals have all the power in this industry from banking to farming!
8938 2018-02-10 18:33:32 Who's the oil slick?
8939 2018-02-10 18:33:21 I blend a lot in my paintings and use A LOT of retarder. So I think oil is meant for me
8940 2018-02-10 18:33:18 who the frick put so much oil down lol
8941 2018-02-10 18:33:16 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
8942 2018-02-10 18:33:16 ISREAL IM SURPRISED AT YOU ..  YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE DO NIT LIKE YOUR ELECTRONICS IN THEIR CONTRY THEY ONLY HSVE 69 MILLION GALLONS OF OIL THERE ... WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING THEM...STOP IT PLEASE ... ISREAL IM MAD @U I WAS TOLD U BELIEVE IN GOD U MUST NOT... LOVE YOUR BROTHER
8943 2018-02-10 18:33:09 Bunch  of goodies: bath oil bombs, bath bombs, blue mask, scrubee, toothpaste tablets & mouthwash tablets.
8944 2018-02-10 18:32:49 I’m not afraid of your cleansing oil!! I literally plan to order it again. My serum is on its last leg. I don’t use it everyday but this winter has my skin DRY!
8945 2018-02-10 18:32:29 brought my car for an oil change this morning .. I don't wanna be here 
8946 2018-02-10 18:32:00 Making the kontommire with vegetable oil instead of palm oil might work for you then
8947 2018-02-10 18:31:58 Aiight so around 1 td I was hungry and I decided imma cut up some hotdogs and fry them. I normally turn on the stove first then slice em while the oil heats up but my sis got cheesed last time cause I took my time and almost burned the pan
8948 2018-02-10 18:31:56 It's more of the plan to tear us apart from each other, if we're frightened of men, especially white men we would want to prevent any oil or building projects where large groups of them would be living and working! Soon there will be no work or even hope of it and rely on benefit
8949 2018-02-10 18:31:54 Only been putting olive oil in my hair, shit is working
8950 2018-02-10 18:31:50 If I didn't have free oil changes @SundanceMazda I would never use their service department again.
8951 2018-02-10 18:31:47 you really going to compare the oil industry with a beautician?  CEO of an oil corporation gets over 4 million a year salary plus perks, in the end he will pay very little tax,especially since the tax reform, the beautician may get 25% of an annual gross income of 30 K (maybe)
8952 2018-02-10 18:31:36 waiting for the oil change to be done. mechanic comes out and tells this lady something is messed up with her car. she proceeds to tell him no there’s nothing wrong and drive away while we can hear her car from inside the building 
8953 2018-02-10 18:31:32 Since you’re afraid of my cleansing oil. I have something else that incorporates the same ingredients and concept but it contains milk and honey.
8954 2018-02-10 18:31:32 If someone dropped oil id be curious to know who it was. If they need to swap the motor that could have big implications at @DISupdates and @amsupdates #NASCAR
8955 2018-02-10 18:31:30 Back on the coconut oil hype... Me mam and lil sissy swear by it. I will have beautiful skin 
8956 2018-02-10 18:31:28 On oil 
8957 2018-02-10 18:31:27 Yes, think about all of those jobs that will be created cleaning up oil spills and adding 5 meters to the sea walls.
8958 2018-02-10 18:31:15 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
8959 2018-02-10 18:31:05 One more, most really bad inflations are when productive capacity is destroyed (eg Weimer, Germany, if our country was blow up we'd have a big inflation problem) or cost-push (oil prices) in the 70s (not that wages weren't also a problem.) Peace man.
8960 2018-02-10 18:30:54 Uhh!
Actually that's what oil supposed to do
8961 2018-02-10 18:30:50 call out post to @MassimiNatalie for not sharing her hair oil secrets with me... its racist & im banishing her from the family
8962 2018-02-10 18:30:30 $BTE will break-out as soon as the price of Oil does... @BaytexEnergy
8963 2018-02-10 18:30:21 Oil in the Midwest? lol
8964 2018-02-10 18:30:17 Lots of talk about First Nations people. Clark feels if we do it right, moving oil over from other countries will help alter the future of indigenous people in this country. #CdnPoli

8966 2018-02-10 18:29:42 I personal can’t, I don’t really like it with rice because of the oil
8967 2018-02-10 18:29:36 Wow, oil companies say they’re paying too much, big surprise there. I’m mean they’re word is totally trustworthy
8968 2018-02-10 18:29:32 Up to 8.8 BILLION dollars lost annually in the tourism industry WHEN the first oil tanker spills. Dead whales floating around....
8969 2018-02-10 18:29:28 Its only connection to hummus is that the main ingredient is puréed garbanzo beans. No garlic, no olive oil, no tahini.
8970 2018-02-10 18:29:24 I am extremely Proud of the Alberta Oil industry as they do a Stupendous Job on Many levels and Enrich our Lives by doing So!

But now d rates of petrol r above Rs80ltr n Gas cylinder at Rs800, which were slightly higher than half then!
8982 2018-02-10 18:27:12 Hillary, Obama, blah blah blah SNORE. We can spot criminal behavior quite easily with our eyes and do not require self-proclaimed partisan “pundits” or “experts” to identify snake oil salesmen, they are as old and familiar as the dirt that makes up Trump’s entire existence.

8984 2018-02-10 18:26:22 Read the thread I posted. Don’t believe the hype. I’m all for a raise, but big oil needs to pay more than 4%. Wind power is being slammed.

8990 2018-02-10 18:25:40 Hot oil treatments are great and all but the oil dripping down my neck is so annoying lol
8991 2018-02-10 18:25:33 Nobody is giving oil companies money from tax payers and the same should go for any industry.
8992 2018-02-10 18:25:10 ~ No eggs ... it's the goat cheese in between ~ 
Ingredients 6 bacon slices, cut in half - 12 large raw shrimp, peeled and cleaned - 
4 teaspoons canna-olive oil, 3 tablespoons goat cheese, cold - Squeeze of lemon - Pinch of salt ... 
8993 2018-02-10 18:25:10 I use weed for every ailment but it never works good enough for cramps unless it's CBD oil. Good thing I saved those percs the ER gave me. I JUST LOVE HAVING A UTERUS HAHA
8994 2018-02-10 18:25:08 Tip: If you run out of eye makeup remover, use olive oil to wipe away mascara. Dab with focaccia then follow up with a meatball under-eye treatment for a youthful, spicy glow.

Your worries will go away once you get impeached then the criminal charges will come with jail time all for for lying and deceiving the American people for your own personal gain and abuse of power to betray the USA.
8997 2018-02-10 18:24:48 like linseed oil
8998 2018-02-10 18:24:43 I am about as sceptical as they come. If your going to sell me snake oil you best bring the snake with you
8999 2018-02-10 18:24:42 It's still going on. The government took a large portion of my family's property after Hurricane Katrina under the guise of eminent domain & levee reinforcement. The payment offered was small & nonnegotiable. I should mention that there is an oil pipeline involved.
9000 2018-02-10 18:24:18 If oil drop some here wouldn’t it slow inflation and rate hikes expectations... hence lower bond yields?
9001 2018-02-10 18:24:17 Umm...refused to implement sanctions, allowed them to sell oil and other goods to North Korea, allowed oligarchs to benefit financially through interference in our elections, allowed the Russian mafia to launder money through properties, allows them to skirt immigration through..
9002 2018-02-10 18:24:16 They are making used cars and snake oil a bit more palatable.

9008 2018-02-10 18:23:12 Christianity was spread by violence till it was stopped by Islamic violence. Christians changed their tactics to money power. Islamic oil power has given a befitting reply. Now Islam is facing threat by violence within their own community. Both face taste of their own medicine.
9009 2018-02-10 18:23:12 Just before I wrecked this morning I was thinkin’ “damn I need to get my oil changed soon.” 
9010 2018-02-10 18:23:12 Deo gratias.
But let's ask who was in large part responsible for this unleashing of evil against the Christians of Iraq? Those powerful, occult interests who pulled the strings of George W Bush in order to obtain oil, $$$ and power, that's who. Instruments of Satan, nothing less.
9011 2018-02-10 18:23:10 Use some olive oil! Leave the onions in or take them out! No matter—it's a malleable little dish. Really good for non-cooks, too. Once they taste it, they go, "Damn, I made that" and hopefully go on from there.
9012 2018-02-10 18:23:02 Today is the day I will try oil paints

9021 2018-02-10 18:21:02 Two independent auditor generals also said Albertans weren’t getting their fair share when oil was at $80+bbl then the CONs hurriedly vilified them. NDP had no choice as oil was at ~$40bbl and sinking. You’re comparing apples to oranges.
9022 2018-02-10 18:20:55 Very true. Wasn't that also the time we moved from the gold standard to oil for the value of the dollar?

And we have invaded every country that didn't have a "central bank." 

Lybia, Iraq, Afghanistan... So left are Syria, Iran, and NK... Who are all enemies of the state.
9023 2018-02-10 18:20:44 @realDonaldTrump ur Startegy  to squeeze dprk is finally working. Let’s tighten the screws and make sure oil is not available to the scumbag.

9027 2018-02-10 18:20:33 I'd definitely want to kill surface dwellers if they spilled oil  melting icecaps, killing corals and making many species of aquatic life go extinct while playing golf.
9028 2018-02-10 18:20:33 Don't mean to be completely cynical, but is there oil there?
9029 2018-02-10 18:20:17 That Tongan guy from the Summer Olympics really lost 30 lbs so he could qualify for the winter Olympics JUST so he could walk around in 0 degree weather wearing only coconut oil and a leaf and get some attention.

9131 2018-02-10 18:07:53 btw, when I said keto desserts I meant the nut or coconut flour  portion was problematic for me (no sense of satiety), but bulletproof coffee, butter or coconut oil w a bit of 90% chocolate wasn't.

USA invaded Iraq for Zionists Israel in anti Muslims war. No one ask you to change your religion, you follow what you like so is me
9142 2018-02-10 18:05:36 Ok today's goals, oil change,workout, and well hopefully something fun.
9143 2018-02-10 18:05:22 Fish oil burps are the worst  
9144 2018-02-10 18:05:20 Mass export of oil.  Mass import of plastic junk to fill plastic junk loonie stores bought by mass consumers to fill mass garbage dumps.  Why use this as the backdrop for your promotion?
9145 2018-02-10 18:05:16 Got oil this morning now we have no heat or hot water. The guy we get oil from doesn't service them & no one will service us cause we aren't customers ... How do you get customers if you won't take customers????

9149 2018-02-10 18:04:14 *snuggling* - like we should build this thing so Wall Street could monetize Canadian oil and it was really important because it was a symbol of friendship. How could the pipeline be bad when Canada is so non-threatening?
9150 2018-02-10 18:04:10 Olive oil>All other oils.

If you disagree fight me.

9155 2018-02-10 18:02:41 To jest wg Korwina zbrodnia. Komunizm powoduje przepływy od bogatych do biednych poprzez uspołecznianie, kominy płac itp. Skrajny liberalizm odwrotnie, od biednych do bogatych i kończy się działalnością antymonopolową jak ze S.Oil, AT&T czy PanAm. Dlatego państwo jest regulatorem

9170 2018-02-10 18:01:04 The middle class tax cut is small & temporary. Millions will lose their healthcare. His administration is run by and for Wall Street and big oil.

9172 2018-02-10 18:00:52 Not entirely sure. He reminds me of a loose cannon that nobody will use while the fighting isn’t heavy. What happens when battle turns chaotic? And I wouldn’t put it past him to sell out the US for a big $$ oil deal in Russia.
9173 2018-02-10 18:00:46 Stop wasting my time with your Zionist hasbara/propaganda. The US funded foreign terrorists to topple Assad in 2011 causing the carnage misery & death there.

"Move It" is great for dancing, smiles, and personality.
"Cozy Time" is one of my favorites.

And "Wet Summer" if you want just a little naughty thrown in the mix.
Hope this helps.

9231 2018-02-10 17:58:27 There is talk about pricing oil in gold in the future and separating it from USD. This will cause a large spike in gold prices if this happens.
9232 2018-02-10 17:58:24 NPA, MNREGA, Rising Proce of Crude Oil, a possible drought, war/skirmishes  with Pakistan or China , ..........
9233 2018-02-10 17:57:51 Yep. From my backyard vantage point, I can see top portion of the distillation towers of the massive Cherry Point WA refinery (across Semiahmoo Bay), which is landing point of Alaskan oil super tankers.
9234 2018-02-10 17:57:39 *My sleeve caught fire so I reclaimed control by dousing myself in oil[I burn on my own terms]*
9235 2018-02-10 17:57:12 @iowahawkblog @MMFlint Probably not...too fatty...they would burn him in their oil lamps though...
9236 2018-02-10 17:57:03 A producer has a surplus of something, that they don’t need (or need, but don't need to protect), but is valuable to others (and/or more valuable when shared). Like used vegetable oil at fast food places being used to power cars. Is there an economic term for this?
9237 2018-02-10 17:57:00 You forgot to mention that Denmark has nowhere near the level of oil, gas and hydro resource that Scotland has, yet it still manages well
9238 2018-02-10 17:56:39 I roasted 2 things of garlic then mashed it. Added olive oil, a little Salt, and red pepper flakes and that's what's on the pasta. Then topped with the tomatos. The chicken is just breaded in Parmesan and I made zucchini in the pan after the chicken 
9239 2018-02-10 17:56:33 Being an adult is not fun. I have to clean my car, get an oil change and a smog
9240 2018-02-10 17:56:32 MoU signed between ADNOC and a consortium of oil companies lead by ONGC for 10% concession in Abu Dhabi Lower Zakum oil field. This is the first time a concession has been given to Indian Oil Co. enhancing energy security for India

9241 2018-02-10 17:56:28 And does the UK have vast reserves of oil that the entire economy is built on or is it preposterous to compare them?
9242 2018-02-10 17:56:23 Try a lil coconut oil 
9243 2018-02-10 17:56:15 I just want to go home and make this facial exfoliating scrub :(
Then use coconut oil in my hair, smoke a bowl and do my homework lol
9244 2018-02-10 17:56:13 It is oil whether you like it or not. Last I heard, the Green Party was arguing that it should be upgraded in Canada and exported as a higher gravity product. Is that your premise? Let’s have it. #cdnpoli
9245 2018-02-10 17:56:04 I say build the refineries here (close to the oil sands...no need to transport it cross country multiple times before it gets to it's destination). I don't understand why it hasn't been done And, if it isn't feasible then why hasn't that been addressed yet?
9246 2018-02-10 17:56:02 Interesting. I recently read somewhere we import oil both from Venezuela and Iran despite sanctions. Plus US oil after the fracking boom. How does it play out?
9247 2018-02-10 17:55:52 I asked my Nana "What'ya think your great, great grandkids should do when they run outta oil?"
After I finished explaining peak oil & fossil fuel depletion, she said: "Isaac is smart. He'll figure it out."
And that's our problem. We all have "NanaSyndrome". Isaac will fix it.

9249 2018-02-10 17:55:21 In some videos I have seen recently, ancient #Egyptians poured water ahead of the blocks for the #pyramids as they were pulled to reduce friction.  My question: is there evidence to show they used something other than water?  Maybe oil?  Fat? Petroleum oil? #Archaeology #Egypt
9250 2018-02-10 17:55:02 all I know is change the tires n oil  da rest going to a mechanic or a buddy LMAOOO
9251 2018-02-10 17:54:57 [heats up the oil] That's good, baby. Now, can you help Papa cutting those vegetables? [grabs two cutting boards and two knives, placing it on the counter. he then grabs a tomato, cutting it into two] just like this. follow papa.
9252 2018-02-10 17:54:57 I hope my future wife is one who understands that cooking oil is not needed in every meal. 
9253 2018-02-10 17:54:55 Absolutely correct. And don't forget his campaign promise to take the Oil Fields if elected. Well those 4 Soldiers were protecting ExxonMobil Oil Fields in Chad and Niger. Nothing Militarily, just Oil.
9254 2018-02-10 17:54:55 Heard undercover oil extraction in Uganda has been ongoing since 2000. But surprisingly some people keep using the phrase "when oil extraction begins, bla bla bla". My brothers and sisters, u had better substituted that phrase wth "when the oil gets finished..."

Worked like a charm.
9271 2018-02-10 17:51:19 I like you as a journalist, but look forward to seeing the same level of excitement from you when there is a headline for oil bulls. Feeling is those headlines are being swept under the carpet..

9277 2018-02-10 17:49:11 Super piece. On the economic utility argument, we're a huge market for Arab countries (oil) and we should be leveraging that to our advantage. Instead India stupidly projects itself as a slave. Time to call their bluff but we won't.

9281 2018-02-10 17:48:35 Exactement. It's usually more of an indicator if the change in price comes from shifts in the demand side of either gold or oil.
9282 2018-02-10 17:48:32 You are very mastering the facts distorts,because USA established lSlS and destroyed everything ,3.5 mil people relocated to Türkiye and USD brings PYD and PKK to these land for oil.

9284 2018-02-10 17:48:21 Dude, went through your Twitter posts. You’re like, DEFCON Alpha brainwashed. There’s no point in explaining anything to you. I’d just be wasting my thumbprint oil.
9285 2018-02-10 17:48:19 Oh, pooh. The oil bust was breaking into a small boom before your #TaxScam passed. Besides, oil companies have been just sitting on profits for quite a while now. You'll have to do better to convince us your tax scam is more than redistribution of $$$ upwards. #NOPearce4NM

9288 2018-02-10 17:48:07 Oooo nice~
If ya let 'em marinade overnight ( really any kind of meat ) its super good, especially if you get a nice broil at the end to caramelize up some of the fat/oil.
Excellent taste in marinade too, it sounds so good~ 
Few ingredient marinades are the best~

9291 2018-02-10 17:47:42 I swear.... the mechanic is worse than the doctor. I want an oil change... and something else is wrong.
9292 2018-02-10 17:47:29 Please don't call Betty White a National Treasure. Trump will cut her off from the public and allow private oil companies to submit bids for drilling.

9295 2018-02-10 17:46:52 Shouldn't use anything with oil or alcohol, oil will block your pores (aka pimples) and alcohol will dry out your face

9299 2018-02-10 17:46:15 Carbon Tax is a conservative principle that believes in market solutions and a level playing field.
Any business person knows this n it’s why big oil has embraced this positive market enhancing development.
I for one ain’t following Ford Down stupid Street.
Brown had it right!
9300 2018-02-10 17:45:55 Oil change places are the equivalent of ultra tans. You go in for one simple thing and they attack you abt buying all these extras you don't really need or care abt. Ugh.

9306 2018-02-10 17:44:18 Had a recent discussion about this very thing. Why do you rarely see women complain about equality in the coal mining, oil drilling, logging, or commercial fishing jobs?  Male dominated industries, but apparently free of sexism & untouched by the nefarious hand of the Patriarchy
9307 2018-02-10 17:44:11 The oil overlords are ignoring what the purpose of a severance tax is when they call for it to be placed on renewables. The oil is being taken without replacement from the people of Oklahoma. The wind and sunlight keep coming no matter how much you take.
9308 2018-02-10 17:44:06 Started oil pulling 
9309 2018-02-10 17:43:44 Don't be Rediculous!! Don't You Ever wonder Why They're So Strict about contamination? I'm not saying Not to use oil; just that it Can cause Contamination in Groundwater Aquifers /There ARE Concerns. Where I Live there is a 60 year old pipeline laid on the bottom of Lake Superior
9310 2018-02-10 17:43:37 I'm also thinking of going out there with no shirt, smeared in coconut oil. (Omg--yuck. I can't pull THAT off.)

9327 2018-02-10 17:41:22 I like a lot of what I see, I’ve a 12% portfolio weighting to oil & gas via HUR , I can’t really see me increasing that % so I need to sell some HUR to buy any DGOC, in 12 mths HUR will be a multiple of today’s price, imho with DGOC  I’m not so sure #dilemma
9328 2018-02-10 17:41:20 Bakersfield economy is weaker than the state overall. Unemployment is a little high, real estate a little soft and oil, the life blood of Kern County, is also soft
9329 2018-02-10 17:41:18 IMO talks are over and Russia will leave the hard way. It is too close to Russia elections to lose that leverage now. I have been predicting $10 oil as a dose of medicine for them.  Were in the oil business now and he don't we be in no oil business with us.

9335 2018-02-10 17:40:34 Canada is 30  years behind with the marine industry shipping and oil shipping prevention when you look at WA State.

9348 2018-02-10 17:38:31 The high on the DJIA futures on 1/29 =26,666. Perhaps a long term top now? SPX 666 was a long term bottom. Also the High on WTIC oil this year is $66.66.
9349 2018-02-10 17:38:07 Yeah, I probably should have specified I meant the leaf as the root source, then either pressed into oil like THC or made into tablets taken by mouth.
9350 2018-02-10 17:38:04 Go oil.
9351 2018-02-10 17:37:50 Playing @CivGame and AI is Philip II of Spain so when I got a portrait if him, I gave it to Spain as a gift. Just got my painting back, by the japanese, in return for oil 
9352 2018-02-10 17:37:40 cbd oil has all the benefits of weed but it DOES NOT get you high!!! so you can totally use it before work or whenever you feel like you need it.
9353 2018-02-10 17:37:35 I have $10 samples of the CBD oil and the rub. Let me know if you want to try some.
9354 2018-02-10 17:37:34 I don't know for sure if it is in Brown County, IN. It just reminds me of it. But I will say if ever you get the chance to visit Brown County...grab your camera and jump to it. It is like being inside of an oil painting of beauty.
9355 2018-02-10 17:37:31 @rahulgandhi2020
Mr.Rahul ji, please talk about the following in your all meetings
1. Note ban use and benefits
2. Unemployment 
3. fuel prices hike even the crude oil price is low for so many years
4. Amith shah son's income secret??
5. Rafel why modi taken individual decision ?
9356 2018-02-10 17:37:24 ทำอะไร ก็รอดูจ้า ทำเลยๆๆ // แต่ดูจากไลฟ์วันนี้แล้ว ข้อ2 แน่ๆ  
9357 2018-02-10 17:37:19 Focus , eye of the tiger ! You got it !
9358 2018-02-10 17:37:13 @RachelNotley why not upgrade your product? That creates more and longer term employment than a pipeline could get the east coast off imported oil. Wouldn’t that be a better use of your politics capital than a #wineembargo ?
9359 2018-02-10 17:36:54 இந்தியாவின் ONGC Videsh நிறுவனம் அபுதாபியின் Abu Dhabi National Oil Companyன் 10% பங்குகளை வாங்குகிறது!! அதற்கான ஒப்பந்தம் நாளை 11ம் தேதி பிரதமர் மோடி முன்னிலையில் கையெழுத்தாகிறது!!
9360 2018-02-10 17:36:31 Yep Mrs O is on it @oil_mrs
9361 2018-02-10 17:36:07 The weird thing is that thc  oil is illigal here but weed not so people can just make it themselves if they know how too. But that stuff makes you a bit weird in your head 
9362 2018-02-10 17:35:57 I really woke up early before work to go get an oil change and my car washed. Who am I?
9363 2018-02-10 17:35:53 Oil & Gas
9364 2018-02-10 17:35:48 Also oil going up
9365 2018-02-10 17:35:36 don’t wear so much makeup! try coconut oil!! just wash your face (: lemon & brown sugar will do the trick (-:
9366 2018-02-10 17:35:24 And for Manchester.  It always rains in Manchester so oil based must be the best way to stay dry.
9367 2018-02-10 17:35:21 And you know it’s them cos they got that mixture of engine oil and cologne smell
9368 2018-02-10 17:35:13 Today’s goals:
Finish my paper before 1
Get an oil change 
Get gas 
Fold clothes 
Pack 
Eat salad & Smoothies 

9369 2018-02-10 17:35:12 They drive vehicles with internal combustion engines.

One burns literally anything to make power on Pacific islands.

Most of your “customers” intend to dump oil in soil or water at end of use, or burn it.

You say #CO2isgood to encourage them.

You’ll laugh when they flood.
9370 2018-02-10 17:35:12 Fried plantain in coconut oil tho
9371 2018-02-10 17:35:06 Try joy of baking's fudgy chocolate brownie.. And for eggless version u can try Jamie Oliver's vegan chocolate brownie recipe.. just substitute melted butter for oil n milk for soy milk..
9372 2018-02-10 17:34:39 Been tryinna find oil/ wax since this damn year started.and nobody wants to help me find any.
9373 2018-02-10 17:34:36 i bought avocado oil 100ml for 30+ lul
9374 2018-02-10 17:34:34 Mans just needs some rogaine and some castor oil. That is all 
9375 2018-02-10 17:34:32 vape oil. Please I must see
9376 2018-02-10 17:34:31 GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT, Unlike my daily trip to work located in brantwood road N17 where the council allowed a breakers yard to take over, glass, oil and crap everywhere, you sir don't give a shit about everyday life in tottenham
9377 2018-02-10 17:34:28 Fingers crossed the weather is better this week, just ran out of oil and I’m not moving house for another week 
9378 2018-02-10 17:34:18 Inferior good- an increase in income leads to a decrease in demand

Example: increase in pay leads to decrease demand for Noodles

Noodles is the inferior good.
9379 2018-02-10 17:34:07 up here getting an oil change and i’m starving asf
9380 2018-02-10 17:33:52 やっぱりか

If youare real Kurdish person not armenian converted to kurdish ..
9383 2018-02-10 17:33:19 drink two litres of water a day and use tea tree oil on spots
9384 2018-02-10 17:33:14 Rub oil on it 
9385 2018-02-10 17:33:12 I can't say who is responsible, ‘in war the first casualty is truth’, still! Money, oil and rich mans games. We do need an outside power but who is more powerful than the people fighting this war? Not the UN sadly.
9386 2018-02-10 17:33:05 This panel would be more realistic if she had  at least a truly environmental voice on board. The people on this support strongly support the oil industry.
9387 2018-02-10 17:33:04 Oya @EAukot before you shout all over , what are you doing about the reduction of oil revenue benefit to locals in percentage from 10% to 5% by @UKenyatta through his memorandum? @CpaWaweru @Thirdwaykenya @GovernorNanok @KenyaGovernors
9388 2018-02-10 17:33:03 Blood or oil
9389 2018-02-10 17:32:55 @ec_minister Are you going to ignore the First Nations that support development of the oil industry and pipelines? Or are you just putting up more obstacles for those industries. You are hurting Canadians and our economy with your policies. You are the worst Environment Minister.
9390 2018-02-10 17:32:54 why can't diablo set fire to blaze's oil spill #hgc
9391 2018-02-10 17:32:40 You might deal with a '66 Mustang that leaks a little oil, but an '12 Accord  doing the same, you simply get rid of it.
9392 2018-02-10 17:32:29 In the waiting room getting my oil changed, dude just walked in and started asking a guy WITH HEADPHONES IN a bunch of personal questions. I’m shook.
9393 2018-02-10 17:32:27 napabile tuloy ng efficascent oil ng wala sa oras oh
9394 2018-02-10 17:32:23 Honestly it should be wildly available in my opinion. Especially the CBD oil, it isn't addictive and doesn't make you high/ stoned or what ever.
9395 2018-02-10 17:32:05 Thanks Aunt Jesse. My CBD oil just wasn’t enough for me last night.
9396 2018-02-10 17:31:57 @LollyCalypso BABE you and i need to give oil cleansing a shot
9397 2018-02-10 17:31:51 Inflation- increase in overall level of prices
9398 2018-02-10 17:31:42 Being an adult and getting a very overdue oil change. Taking advantage of running errands today. 

Still sad there’s no black label. Buy my 8x10’s so I can still make money today!
9399 2018-02-10 17:31:41 Maintaining Siberian prisons must be getting expensive. When the price of oil was higher, they were just arresting everybody who showed up & sending them off to work camps.
9400 2018-02-10 17:31:38 Yes he is!! Bet he's shivering under all that oil!! 
9401 2018-02-10 17:31:36 Reheating in a frying pan with a little olive oil magically amplifies the day-after goodness.
9402 2018-02-10 17:31:30 How's this LP oil for dabs? Any better than the original honey or hash oil? #EducationIsKey #GrowYourOwnTherapy
9403 2018-02-10 17:31:22 Oil WTI to Sell.
9404 2018-02-10 17:31:20 Fun fact: Oil traps in heat! So, his choice to still use the oil would have kept him warmer than if he had used no oil.
9405 2018-02-10 17:31:14 Opportunity cost- what you give up to obtain another item

Example: I gave up hwk  to get sleep
9406 2018-02-10 17:31:10 I've been sitting at Honda for two and a half hours for an oil change and change of transmission fluid. #thismamaistiredofwaiting 
9407 2018-02-10 17:31:03 Eikö ollu joku oil jotaki mitä kans ostettiin pullon takia 
9408 2018-02-10 17:31:01 Venezuela got the largest oil reserves in the world at $60 a barrel they should be very rich
9409 2018-02-10 17:30:58 coconut oil does nothing for me.
9410 2018-02-10 17:30:55 Me on ground trying to take photo "the phone is in firm grip"
Me on any high place, suddenly the phone feels like it is dipped in oil nd will slip
9411 2018-02-10 17:30:55 You seem to forget even after Project Fear #brexit won. And since then I have heard every snake oil explanation of why #brexit did win but didn’t actually win. time will tell but this whole episode could have some very interesting outcomes at the next GE #BREXIT #REMAIN
9412 2018-02-10 17:30:45 Itoje and Launchbury making  AWJ look like a broken oil tanker  #ENGvWAL
9413 2018-02-10 17:30:19 I use it with my Curology prescription & Beautycounter’s balancing oil PM and then with  Countermatch AM
9414 2018-02-10 17:30:04 Yolanda let me use her car this week and when I took her car for an oil change they said she has a nail in her tire. IM IN SO MUCH TROUBLE 
9415 2018-02-10 17:30:02 Will the Patriots losing be the final deathblow to the poorly educated. The guy is literally the epitome of snake oil salesman.
9416 2018-02-10 17:29:56 Instead of purporting to lead the opposition, Mr. @EAukot can start by pushing for 10% and NOT 5% for host communities for oil revenues in his backyard. Brother, can you lead this agenda and make sure you win!
9417 2018-02-10 17:29:54 Pieces of imperial shit! Only thing you crooks, killers & swine are ever after is oil & other precious materials.
9418 2018-02-10 17:29:51 This is Putin’s plan to move the war into oil production areas, create a shortage, trump lifts sanctions, Putin Tillerson Trump make lots of money.
9419 2018-02-10 17:29:50 Missing forest for trees. Time to lead AB oil workers into new industry & lead Canada/world to a healthy planet. @TheLeap_Org @leadnowca
9420 2018-02-10 17:29:48 microdosing cbd oil
9421 2018-02-10 17:29:48 It’s only 11:30a and I am zooted... only got an oil change so far lol.
9422 2018-02-10 17:29:38 Price discrimination- the act of selling the same product at different  prices to different buyers. In order to maximize sales and profit
9423 2018-02-10 17:29:26 need my oil changed  i’m 3000 miles over 
9424 2018-02-10 17:29:25 2 all those #invested in #fossilfuels or #oil. B #warned. #Shift ur #investment, shift ur #economies. Oil & fossil fuels is #losing #cause. U will #lose #money. #Cash #out #now & save the #disappointment. We’ve reached #peakoil. It’s a #downward #spiral from here for fossil fuels
9425 2018-02-10 17:29:24 @cathmckenna those oil people are just rapists #NotMyGoverment
9426 2018-02-10 17:29:08 I always laugh when I watch the season 8 opener where Bobby is being wheeled out of Ewing Oil, only it's just recut footage from the Who Shot JR episode. I think Cliff is even in the background of one of the wide shots.
9427 2018-02-10 17:29:02 We agree on this. It’s just not a transition that’s going to happen quickly. It is slowly taking place already. Not developing oil sands doesn’t slow down oil demand and we can’t afford to sacrifice our economy as we transition.
9428 2018-02-10 17:28:57 Jojoba oil smells like Black Excellence #dominating
9429 2018-02-10 17:28:46 why America not helping to fight the war in Yemen, they don't have no oil mine for benefits
9430 2018-02-10 17:28:43 @great_oil is on it. See ya in 17 hours.

9433 2018-02-10 17:28:33 I bet there’s oil somewhere in there, or coal, or a good place to graze cattle, it’s a shame nobody is wrecking this for cash, pretty ain’t profitable.
9434 2018-02-10 17:28:30 Canada projects a veneer underneath which indigenous people violently die, oil and factory farms destroy land and animals, & justice rots.
9435 2018-02-10 17:28:24 Smoke. Juice. Benefiber water. Wash hair. Leave in conditioner. Face scrub. Bio oil. Squats. Paint nails. Dishes. Change sheets. Brooklyn 9-9. Deep stretch at least 30 minutes. Mini muffin batch. When lovers home, be in an amazing mood and take care of him. 
9436 2018-02-10 17:28:22 The O&G industry is not going away tomorrow like you want. The transition away from fossil fuels will take decades and we still need oil until then, hence the pipelines. At least #Trudeau is taking some steps to address climate change. It's not one or the other, it should be both
9437 2018-02-10 17:28:19 Yeah  in the Netherlands you can buy CBD oil in stores. But the THC oil is
9438 2018-02-10 17:28:13 Y’all can catch me on ig live around 10:30 and ima be putting some thc oil on my doink lol
9439 2018-02-10 17:28:08 So im going to get my oil changed along with routing maintenance on my car how many products I don’t need do you think they’ll offer to me ? 
9440 2018-02-10 17:28:02 I hope he does, but he stands with Trump. Those who voted for Trump, voted to kill all parks, conservation & monuments all over US. Trump & republicans told all they wanted to destroy all for oil & shell. They are keeping their promises. Republicans = for rich only.
9441 2018-02-10 17:28:00 aztec healing clay + apple cider vinegar + tea tree oil + honey = self care saturday 
9442 2018-02-10 17:27:58 @instantreplayjj not sure if you got anything going on but I’m down on 60th/kzoo. Bout to get an oil change and beer if you’re bored
9443 2018-02-10 17:27:43 I just made some homemade roasted red peppers hummus and omaygahd i died sobrang sarap. For a 1 can of chickpea, ang dami na pala . Also substitute some aquafaba for olive oil. 
9444 2018-02-10 17:27:40 And the fact that it’s the currency used to buy oil. When, not if, China starts buying oil in RMB, the USD will collapse.
9445 2018-02-10 17:27:28 Russia in Syria for all it can get Med. Ports Gas oil and arms deals - when all hell breaks lose its going to go pear shaped for them-
9446 2018-02-10 17:27:07 My brother said he would change my oil on Wednesday. He didn’t change my oil Wednesday night so he said he would change it on Friday. It’s Saturday and my oil still isn’t changed I think I need a new brother.

9448 2018-02-10 17:27:02 I am planning to stop all sort of junk food though. Gonna cut out all oil except for natural fish one. -_- And I am gonna hit the gym from Monday onwards. Gotta lose atleast those 15 kgs again.  it was so amazing being 58 kgs. Lol

9451 2018-02-10 17:26:07 That awkward moment when you're changing your oil but you were tightening the nut to drain the oil and not loosening it
9452 2018-02-10 17:25:53 ここ行ったら一発で出たわ
9453 2018-02-10 17:25:52 MoU b/w Indian Consortium & ADNOC was signed for acquisition of 10% participating interest in offshore Lower Zakum Concession from 2018 to 2057, It's 1st Indian Investment in upstream oil sector of UAE, transforming buyer-seller relationship to long-term investor relationship:MEA
9454 2018-02-10 17:25:47 They all buy into the 'oil is a bonus' lie the SNP manufactured when the oil price collapsed.
9455 2018-02-10 17:25:46 Hey Sarah, why don't you go suck up some of that mercury being exposed in the melting permafrost. You know because we use all of that drill baby drill oil and are warming the planet at a record pace.
9456 2018-02-10 17:25:38 Where the heck can I find Cottonseed oil??? SMH!!
9457 2018-02-10 17:25:29 Cost is linked, 2 features; load, weapon delivery, speed, vulnerability to attack, oil storage, time of deal, so on so forth. Comparing oranges to apples is foolhardy. Con is Desperate to stick 'scam' tag to BJP led NDAgovt. Scared of impending death knell with 2nd term for BJP
9458 2018-02-10 17:25:27 I thought it was weird that they covered the Tonga guy in Petro oil this time around. Other cultures are so cool!
9459 2018-02-10 17:25:26 @GovInslee Please consider #California's enactment of laws to stop crude oil from flowing into their state from offshore drilling.  Make appropriate laws NOW to stop all transport of this oil through our state! #nooffshoredrilling #standuptooil
9460 2018-02-10 17:25:21 I can’t get the oil/sesame balance right
9461 2018-02-10 17:25:20 Actually sweetie, you remind me of a lot of many software salesmen I've met, full of hot air and bluster. I don't see any point debating with a snake oil seller. God help whoever you consult for.
9462 2018-02-10 17:25:18 Exactly! So you can buy legal weed oil without a prescription?
9463 2018-02-10 17:25:11 Grateful for the sales guys at autozone and YouTube for helping me replace my own engine air filter myself  for $10 instead of $22 the oil change place tried to sell me.  Took 10 minutes and 3 questions.

9466 2018-02-10 17:25:00 Stop, @CBCTheHouse, calling the work to increase profits of oil & gas businesses “energy projects”. These are fossil fuel, fossil carbon projects and can _not_ be developed sustainably. @jimcarr_wpg is simply wrong. Ask why there’s such eagerness to help KM?
9467 2018-02-10 17:24:58 Baby oil nya saya kok gagap ya? Hm?
9468 2018-02-10 17:24:37 Idk if it’s the argan oil but it smells so yummy
9469 2018-02-10 17:24:27 Iyaa sama sama :) itu cuma ditambahin kayak oil gitu hehe
9470 2018-02-10 17:24:25 A very adult morning—mailed off tax return, went to the bank, got an oil change. Now it's time for some Donkey Kong 64.
9471 2018-02-10 17:24:15 I’ve been dealing with two tears in my rt shoulder for a year. My gf got me a 90min cbd oil massage. 

She’s the one.
9472 2018-02-10 17:23:58 Nagpa hot oil ka pala love?
9473 2018-02-10 17:23:57 I wash my face with cetaphil oil control acne face wash and put differin gel on my acne (only a little bit or it’ll dry out ur skin) and my skin is clearing up:)
9474 2018-02-10 17:23:46 My issue with the fight over the Kinder Morgan pipeline is that Canada has so many mines: silver, copper, uranium that are not environmentally friendly. These remain. Wineries aren't environmentally friendly: they use pesticides. We can sell oil in a responsible manner.
9475 2018-02-10 17:22:56 Shout out to @KyleBacker43 for helping me with the oil change on Felicity  Thanks brotha!
9476 2018-02-10 17:22:45 Add coconut oil and throw it in a blender real quick.
9477 2018-02-10 17:22:42 I have the baby oil with shea and cocoa butter. It normally works
9478 2018-02-10 17:22:38 Now I don't have the chance of becoming a painkiller addict. I'll become a weed oil addict.
9479 2018-02-10 17:22:37 Tea tree oil is good for drying something out or disinfecting, aloe Vera is best for redness and inflammation. Tea tree oil might irritate u even more
9480 2018-02-10 17:22:36 Bawang putih she guna selabu. Penyek dulu satu-satu dengan kulit, panaskan atas pan tanpa minyak sampai naik perang. Then baru campur olive oil/ minyak masak. Simpan dalam bekas, lenyek2 sikit then sapu bila dah suam/sejuk. Pakai kat dada, belakang, kaki, dan betis
9481 2018-02-10 17:22:17 Pacaran sini sama aku, baby oil?
9482 2018-02-10 17:21:57 Honestly how much oil do you think it takes to manufacture those renewables?? Solar panels don’t just appear out of thin air and until they do we’re still going to need oil to create them. Also anyone who drives a car, uses electronics or  wears clothes is a supporter of oil.
9483 2018-02-10 17:21:48 @JulieGichuru : What gave you the guts to take the step into the oil business? How have you positioned yourself right now in order to get the knowledge, the information, the skill and the training you need to keep on top of the game? #AfricaLD
9484 2018-02-10 17:21:41 Getting @BurgerKing mother & sister are getting @tacobell I haven't ate taco bell In forever to much oil.!
9485 2018-02-10 17:21:38 I will post a photo of our oil extraction lab once complete. Shouldn't take more than 2 weeks with the other work going on in the facility.

9487 2018-02-10 17:21:17 Oil industry worldwide is very guilty in #humanrights abuses, yes.  

#Dilbit or Canadian oil has externalities on people who - like in #Kalamazoo or #FortMcKay or #LacMegantic - have no choice nor role in the transaction between criminals.

Everyone between you and the buyer...
9488 2018-02-10 17:21:17 Captain_Shot72 Polkameister cathmckenna Sure. Yep we do. It's why we pushed for a Northern tanker ban, its why we're pushing for that ban to extend to the rest of the coast, it's why we stand against arctic oil, and why we are pushing for a faster transition to renewables. #…
9489 2018-02-10 17:21:14 I’ve always been taught aloe is just for sunburns and tea tree oil is for everything else lol.
9490 2018-02-10 17:21:10 someone tell my dad to change my oil i don't feel like talking today bc i amsad
9491 2018-02-10 17:20:50 1. Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.
9492 2018-02-10 17:20:39 First car inspection. Needed rear tires, front brakes, and a oil change. I'm officially broke and I just got paid yesterday 
9493 2018-02-10 17:20:28 Sitting in the garage while in rains enjoying the view of an oil change..
9494 2018-02-10 17:20:20 Cool! Now puzzled by your reactionary attack of my challenge of a pipeline build that undermines the value of moving towards renewables? Yes, I scoff at Suncor - a driverless oil extraction site vehicles = Alberta job losses. Those jobs were justification for Pipeline. No?
9495 2018-02-10 17:20:17 Sure. Yep we do. It's why we pushed for a Northern tanker ban, its why we're pushing for that ban to extend to the rest of the coast, it's why we stand against arctic oil, and why we are pushing for a faster transition to renewables. #DontBelieveEzra
9496 2018-02-10 17:20:15 coconut oil is key
9497 2018-02-10 17:20:08 Ok. Israel and oil!! Agreed!
9498 2018-02-10 17:19:55 U should probably get an oil change lol
9499 2018-02-10 17:19:47 I personally think Wenger gets treated very harshly. In any other era he (& this current Spurs team) would be winning leagues. Just impossible to compete against the Russian oligarchs & Qatari oil money. Sucks much of the joy out of football for me.

9506 2018-02-10 17:18:19 ひいじいちゃんが死んだ時は外さないでそのままかなり時間をかけて焼きましたよ確か葬儀屋の人が2倍ぐらいかかってるって言ってました機械も綺麗に残ってましたし頭やほかの骨も綺麗に残ってました
9507 2018-02-10 17:18:11 Just dropped $1200 on new tires, oil change, and one lower ball joint.
9508 2018-02-10 17:18:08 As I mentioned, talk about something you are experienced with, like Ash-Batal, oil smuggling, back-stabbing or bringing Saddam tanks to Kurdistan.
FYI; I'm from Bashur, I'm no PKK supporter, just a guy disgusted of KDP fake patriotism.
9509 2018-02-10 17:17:50 I can't think of a single party that couldn't integrate a very progressive cycling policy, even UKIP/BNP could frame it as reducing reliance on foreign oil. It's just a good idea all round.
9510 2018-02-10 17:17:40 AMazing! Can't believe President Ding Dong Tr**p wants to sell off this land to oil people!
9511 2018-02-10 17:17:38 This the last oil change I’m getting
9512 2018-02-10 17:17:30 いつもよりいっぱいある気がするんだけどもしかして間違えてるのかも
9513 2018-02-10 17:17:23 I'm getting my oil changed and watching Olympics
9514 2018-02-10 17:17:12 No ma'am, a non stick pan actually. Highhhhhh heat, add oil, add scallops, 2-3 mins turn on medium low and flip. Add butter and butter base the scallops til complete cooking.
9515 2018-02-10 17:16:54 Another argument for the usefulness of coconut oil.
9516 2018-02-10 17:16:47 VP has no class he should acted civil at least by standing up. #TrumpAdminHasNoClass
9517 2018-02-10 17:16:46 It’s like he is dancing on oil lol
9518 2018-02-10 17:16:34 I’d say, “Let’s find out- Why don’t you try being an illegal alien father of 5 in Mexico?” But, considering Mexico’s immigration laws are so much stricter than our own, youd wouldn’t last long enough to have hat many kids.

9521 2018-02-10 17:15:55 Allowing Oil and Gas to drill in what was a national park is NOT keeping America Great, it is DESTROYING it... Private profit at the cost of public land and beauty.

9523 2018-02-10 17:15:25 In Houston, those innocent children on the #ENRON executives suffered greatly when their dads went to prison for fraud and embezzlement, were they not supposed to be imprisoned because they children? 
9524 2018-02-10 17:15:18 Scoop up the oil and juices from the cooking and offer it to her as a peace offering.
9525 2018-02-10 17:15:06 I very rarely oil my finger boards, I clean them up regularly and then oil when it feels right...1/2

9529 2018-02-10 17:14:37 Don't scare the children :)

Will be watching things like oil and gold on sun night to see how it reacts.
9530 2018-02-10 17:14:35 True. If you look around online you can find other variations, too. The one I gave you I got from playing around with a couple sources. I think I've seen olive oil or maybe butter in place of coconut oil too. I never measure that; just take a spoon and scoop some in, lol.
9531 2018-02-10 17:14:29  you might be right cus yall slick as oil 
9532 2018-02-10 17:14:22 $100 oil change wtf  I feel like I’m getting got
9533 2018-02-10 17:14:14 I have already shown him articles reporting Andrew Wilson as saying ‘oil was baked into’ the White Paper. He is clearly too stupid to read.
9534 2018-02-10 17:14:08 We still have tin, coal, bitumen, land, good weather, great human resources, rather we have been narrowed down to oil which and a set of dull minds in power
9535 2018-02-10 17:13:46 Tried to work out what the hashtag was and now I'm even more confused, this is somehow relevant to oil companies but I can't quite seem to grasp how... :thinking:
9536 2018-02-10 17:13:44 oh no guys we slept on the fact that bret Stephens last article claimed that we prob won't run out of oil bc we've never run out of oil before oh my god oh my god oh my god
9537 2018-02-10 17:13:39 He's going to life drilling sanctions so they can get to their oil
9538 2018-02-10 17:13:25 Is coconut oil good or bad. Y'all used to swear by it.

9543 2018-02-10 17:12:48 Does Trump believe oil and gas come from the center of the earth? @hockeyschtick1 @wattsupwiththat
9544 2018-02-10 17:12:45 だんだんこれ化石増殖中じゃないのかと思えてきた
9545 2018-02-10 17:12:34 Well if the east coast can do it I don't see why BC can't. The ecosystem on the east coast is just as fragile, yet they deal with thousands of oil tankers per year. Unless your saying the people of BC are grossly incompetent when it comes to shipping raw materials?
9546 2018-02-10 17:12:29 Trump did NOT do what the people want when he allowed oil and gas to buy national park land for drilling and mining. He won't get my vote again.
9547 2018-02-10 17:12:22 THIS will affect trading:oil and the fruit that comes from this....WAKE up..if u avoid this matter u will be trading blind.
9548 2018-02-10 17:11:55 There has to be some way we can challenge this. It's not even a liberal vs conservative issue. It's a citizen vs big oil issue. Who can argue that protection of our cultural history and natural resources doesn't matter?
9549 2018-02-10 17:11:42 Russia seeks oil, diamonds, gold and military territorial advantages. China seeks same but additionally Thorium, Coltan and rare earth minerals. Iran is already harvesting Uranium and sending it to their country. What is happening in the Orinoquia is a gross and giant ecocide.
9550 2018-02-10 17:11:25 Tech: you need an oil change

*Tech changes oil* you're good 
Me: drives 5 blocks & returns in limp mode
Tech: ohhhhh
9551 2018-02-10 17:11:24 “If we have gas, why do we need oil”
9552 2018-02-10 17:11:17 Bub? Gas is $2.19/gal . We've added 200 oil rigs & 35 more gas rigs in 1 yr! National Parks? I think that's still being negotiated, but I do know Trump donated his 1st quarter salary to NPS. Interest rates are set to rise as the economy improves. That's how it works. #1
9553 2018-02-10 17:11:08 Cook in the oven love. Can't tell last time I fry bacon in oil. Or you fry it in non stick pan as its own oil will begin seep out.

9574 2018-02-10 17:08:36 3. I applaud the premier for showing leadership on climate change, implementing a carbon tax and putting a cap on emissions from the oil sands (100MT). This is so much better than the PCs or WRP or UCP. But growing the tar sands is simply inconsistent with climate science.

9576 2018-02-10 17:08:09 Those are immigration policies.

Your subject’s views on the majorities internalization of the change was interesting.

9597 2018-02-10 17:05:26 @cathmckenna you don’t care about the oil patch worker. Knowing full well Alberta is to smart to vote liberal. So bashing them and destroying our greatest resource doesn’t hurt your image. But be ready for an onslaught in 2019 as the rest of  wakes up to how useless you are.

Turns out it can, and is often recommended. (I've never used it for that purpose before!) So my plot will work just fine...

9632 2018-02-10 17:02:17 1. Ah yes, the 'your phone is made of oil so you must support the oil sands' argument. I didn't say we need to stop producing it. But we absolutely need to be transitioning to clean energy for heating, electricity and transportation.

9652 2018-02-10 17:00:45 I don't fully understand which Russian interests serves Turkey. Do Russians see the Kurds just as US-Proxies? A deal about oil/gas-pipelines through Turkey? Besides military victories against TurkeyFSA it could be key to divide Russia and Turkey again. But how? #DefendAfrin

9668 2018-02-10 16:58:55 It was obviously hyperbole. Even the greats go through slumps. You kind of make my point though. They Oil need puck moving D men to play with McDavid. Instead they sign Kris Russell.

I don’t understand.
9688 2018-02-10 16:55:17 I have to wonder what the men working in the oil fields think of her statement. I do have grandson working out there, however I already know his opinion of liberal government and let's say he won't be voting for them next time around. I think 2019 they will lose the male vote.

9732 2018-02-10 16:49:05 "the first casualty of war is the truth". I am personally baffled what the truth is any more. The ISIS oil convoys went somewhere? Their guns came from somewhere? Why does clinton leaked emals knew that funds/arms to qatar were going to IS. did turkey back the deash to fight YPG?

All that money is gone and well saved in tax haven countries with the complicity of maduro
9736 2018-02-10 16:48:38 And all the thinking citizens of Canada are pushing back. We don't want more pollution in Canada. I'd rather be poor and live in a clean environment, than be oil rich and live in a cesspool while polluting everyone else!

9763 2018-02-10 16:45:11 Funny the provinces of Alberta and Sask only care about their jobs not BCs.  How about we talk about refining the stuff here and create more longterm jobs and create a future for Canada.  Why are these politicians not being visionary...too many donations from big oil.

9767 2018-02-10 16:44:51 Crude oil, Nat Gas, CRB index, Pring inflation index all went into free fall with all world indexes. Why? All these markets want to drag $UST10Y below 2.750 so all world governments do not have to deal with this (3.790) extra cash to manage their debt... monster tug-o-war!

9772 2018-02-10 16:44:27 Every piece of fruit and veg sold in the shops has used pesticides and fertiliser, which again comes from animals or oil. Why is it you vegetarians can't admit that you kill just as many if not more animals as we omnivores who are eating a NATURAL diet?
9773 2018-02-10 16:44:27 It's all about provocation and the set up right now imo but there's going to be some serious head bashing and clearing. I have an outlandish theory; it's going to be 2 prong; Military and flood mkt with oil driving price a hit between putins eyes resulting in 2 black eyes.

9789 2018-02-10 16:42:54 Well there must be a reason.

Perhaps because he’s promised lots of stuff that can never happen and it’s easier to blame people afterwards for the mess he helped create.

Perhaps he’s a snake oil salesmen.

Perhaps he’s really all talk but got no bottle.

9793 2018-02-10 16:42:22 I have contacted client services who has done nothing to help. According to @Acura adding up to 1 qt of oil for every 1,000 miles is normal. It is not normal. I’ve had 4 #Acura #vehicles  and have never added oil between oil changes. Something is wrong. Replace the #engine.

9814 2018-02-10 16:39:40 A tip for buying castor oil: taste it. 

If it is salty, do not buy it.

Apparently, salt is used to stretch the oil. If that salty concoction is used on your hair it can lead to breakage. So taste it before buying it.

9827 2018-02-10 16:37:12 Fell over in work and had to go to A+E, to then watch a man next to me watch two lads in oil rubbing theirselves naked on his phone. Fair to say this is not how I expected my Saturday to turn out
9828 2018-02-10 16:36:58 Don't mine the earth, set off explosions, suck all the oil and water our of it's veins. Lol idk. Perhaps God just has his reasons. We belong to him. We are just renting out these bodies
9829 2018-02-10 16:36:54 No it’s not the same thing. That’s why I cited ~$200 billion & not $1 trillion like Norway. Other things not the same is AB produces 3x as much oil as Norway and has had a sovereign fund (HF) since ‘76, Norway since ‘96. See the difference? Either way it’s still ~$200 Bn missing

9833 2018-02-10 16:36:34 It says Mr. Liu is from San Francisco. What the article doesn't tell you is that cannabis and hash oil are legal in California. As well as Mass Maine Nevada Washington Oregon Alaska Colorado. 

Roughly 68M Americans, 20% of the population, live where cannabis is legal. 

Context.

9841 2018-02-10 16:35:03 How cute! You think you're witty, but you're just another braindead twit who supports a snake oil salesman.
9842 2018-02-10 16:35:01 An option worth considering is to shut off the oil. Gas prices in BC would spike and it would severely impact air traffic at YVR.
9843 2018-02-10 16:34:35 Yes!! you and I and some baby oil..
9844 2018-02-10 16:34:23 Dropped the car off for an oil change and tire rotation.

So finally, ppl had to pay for your loot that yr family has kept in various overseas locations.

9848 2018-02-10 16:34:01 Holy  cow. Bush was a white, conservative, christian and he got us into wars on the basis of WMDs which they never found. The wars were strictly for corporate interests in OIL.

9851 2018-02-10 16:33:44 The Trudeau Liberals would prefer Alberta did not exist.  With revenue from the oil industry getting to tidewater, the budget would be closer to balancing itself.  At least, it would slow the regress to trillion dollar debt.
9852 2018-02-10 16:33:43 Might be. Remember they need also to welcome Russia and China's new oil trading deal outside the dollar. Ramped up production means they need to put another hurting on Putin by flooding market and send more oil to China to offset trade imbalance. Force China to pay in $!

Oh and Crazy dude's sister was there behind VP...
9860 2018-02-10 16:32:35 Although to be fair, public transit is pretty bad in my part of the city and small businesses are shutting down thanks to the oil economy and bad government choices.

9868 2018-02-10 16:30:25 The sale and purchase of counterfeited and adulterated commodities when the purchaser is unaware of its state, like selling milk mixed with water or oil mixed with fat or something else. This action is called cheating

9869 2018-02-10 16:30:15 The "we're giving away oil and gas" argument is immediately debunked when you look at the fact that years after work was started in it, the Corrib field has not produced a single commercial hydrocarbon cent for Shell.

Now he seems just as concerned for my mental stability as he is for my car...

That's fair

Bring back the Progressive wing of the GOP and we'll gobble up the old rust belt vote as if it were the deep south.
9882 2018-02-10 16:28:55  oil goes up and down coast of BC every day. Are u shooting ur mouth off about that? Or wud a spill of  oil b without consequence? Until a decade or so ago, guys like you were quiet as church mice. Let Canadian taxpayers buy all Canadian oil assets, then do what you want.

9892 2018-02-10 16:27:00 When you buy expensive coconut oil and keep the bottle somewhere. Then one lil kid picks the bottle up, pours out the content and throws the bottle away. 

Is that one temptation?
Or God sign?
9893 2018-02-10 16:26:54 I am trying to find an angle to politicize this.  Here's the best I came up with:

Probably a stretch, but I am telling with it.

 That little bugger is cute though.

Btw the Saudis have ramped up their renewable energy programs so they'll have more oil to sell to the other dummies.

9928 2018-02-10 16:22:03 Greetings! 

Ever heard the expression, "The Real McCoy"? Elijah J. McCoy (1844 - 1929) invented a cup that distributed oil evenly over a train engine's moving parts. To save $ train comp would copy the cup, but were wrong. Then owners would ask "Is it the real McCoy?"

Cheers!

9931 2018-02-10 16:21:49 Well, that’s how public companies work, smartass. And Murray Edwards might have something to say about that. The oil sands have been significantly Canadianized over the last five years. But, if you have shares, what’s your point? And, who cares?

9956 2018-02-10 16:18:46 It is dumb that we consume so much oil and that our economy is resource based. I agree. Less oil usage and diversify the economy. Sounds like a plan.
9957 2018-02-10 16:18:40 Many times over the years. The store appears to have no stock control or shelf replenishment systems in place. One of the many items out of stock was own brand sunflower oil. How basic an item is that? There were 2 (2!) Finest chickens on the shelf - both bigger than I required.
9958 2018-02-10 16:18:31 And no, we don’t need oil...we are set sufficient

Rudraksha takes the radiance from the atmosphere and converts it into oil. If we chant ‘Om Namaha Shivaya’ sitting under a rudraksha tree, fragrant oil will emanate from a rudraksha for 24 hours.
