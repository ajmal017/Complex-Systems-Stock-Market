40 2018-09-25 21:07:42 @lokiscottishrap can I catch your TV interview on catch up ?

Would like to hear/see it.

You do Glasgow,/Scotland proud so keep going comrade.

Talent & a social conscience are rare commodities
41 2018-09-25 20:57:59 To be clear. The Few = The ruling elite. The ruling class. Land and wealth owners. Politicians. Press barons, journalists. Those that seek to control, rob or hide commodities to the detriment of others. You are in my sight. You are the enemy.
42 2018-09-25 20:56:36 Giroud and Fellaini are becoming niche commodities. Proper battering rams
43 2018-09-25 20:41:56 He won EC w/78K votes. In 3 swing states exit polls showed HRC winning-then suddenly flipped 2  him. Nothing fishy there. It cracks me up how y'all Drumpfers think his bullshit policies aren't going to affect you. Commodities are already down 20%, It's going to get worse. Own it.
44 2018-09-25 20:38:49 No sólo la comida, la gastronomía... la vida, no pueden ser commodities.
45 2018-09-25 20:38:43 Parte del problema es la vulnerabilidad externa: baja en precios de commodities unido a aumento en servicio de la deuda   y salida de capital debido a alza en tasa de interés en USA impactó devaluación del peso e inflación.
46 2018-09-25 20:38:15 The Rewesternization of everything everywhere. The gains made by 'emerging nations' during the commodities boom of the late 90s and early noughties are swiftly being lost. Even the recent rapprochement of states in the Horn can be classified as a campaign for Rewesternization.
47 2018-09-25 20:36:11 Forse non hai ben chiaro tu gli effetti di una svalutazione. Guarda la Turchia cosa sta succendendo con la svalutazione della lira turca. Hai presente quanto pagheresti in più il petrolio, l’oro, e tutte le commodities prezzate in $. Hallooo
48 2018-09-25 20:36:02 (Yes in the larger sense what we call commodities are all standins for human activity. On one level, important that human beings are different from soybeans. On another level, anything you do with/to "soybeans" is actually something done to humans whose labor they embody.)
49 2018-09-25 20:26:38 Na minha opinião, não. A guerra comercial em si não vai fazer com que eles deixem de comprar commodities do Brasil. Mas talvez você tenha percebido algo que eu não percebi, se tiver, dê sua opinião.
50 2018-09-25 20:24:48 Las acciones del sector energía aumentaron hoy sus ganancias en 0,60%, apuntaladas por los altos precios del petróleo. Las empresas Equinor, BP, Total y Schlumberger entre las que mas avanzaron #Energia #Oil #Petroleo #Finanzas #Economia #Mercados #Commodities #oilandgas
51 2018-09-25 20:21:27 Ese periodo crecimos al 4.1% anual promedio. El doble que los 20 años anteriores y el triple que los 20 posteriores. Con una economía 6 veces menor a causa del precio de commodities, logramos reservas energéticas por 100.000m dolares.
52 2018-09-25 20:15:38 Of course they will after experiencing logistic and product quality problems with secomd and third world commodities.
53 2018-09-25 20:13:19 Wow , ya los compran a futuro? 
Son como los commodities 
54 2018-09-25 20:10:00 And most of that money will be going to commodities, which those farmers can drop for a couple of years and grow more veg instead, which is what is needed in the USA right now.
55 2018-09-25 20:00:11 I think that #Walmart's project is focused on the data created and associated with food across supply chain.

1. Microbiological test for water used on crops
2. MRL test for agricultural commodities
3. CoA results for lots/batchs of products (fruit, dairy, meat)

Just saying 
56 2018-09-25 19:59:00 There's no debate, things like access to clean air, water, Medicare, hygienic products and tampons should be free. Basic human needs shouldn't be considered commodities.
57 2018-09-25 19:55:39 E as commodities comandando esta virada da Bolsa... mesmo com o dolar virando pra queda.
58 2018-09-25 19:53:06 I'm not sure this is a helpful question. It erases something I think is quite salient here, the difference between human beings and nonhuman commodities.
59 2018-09-25 19:46:14 You chow em they chow your moola. That's what we call exchange of commodities
60 2018-09-25 19:44:13 If I knew what drove the commodities market, hell, any commodity’s market, I’d be too rich to worry about twitter.
61 2018-09-25 19:41:16 All the $ hunters bring to habitat protect. is to serve their interest in managing game species and eradicating or hunting (yay!) predators. States follow suit to sell hunting licenses and hire ‘biologists’ to mange game species. Wildlife are not commodities.
62 2018-09-25 19:37:24 So there's a limited number of bitcoin, but there's a limited amount of gold or bauxite or oil and the prices for all of those things vary a lot based on whatever we want to say drives commodities markets.
63 2018-09-25 19:37:01 We do promo videos for commodities #Hi_Lite Films based in Kampala uganda
64 2018-09-25 19:34:19 Consumers are confident that prices will continue to rise and commodities will become scarce. It’s all because of @realDonaldTrump and his crazy and ludicrous tariffs.

65 2018-09-25 19:32:23 so the intellectual case for interventionist policies for  industrialisation in the periphery is directly founded on the idea that  the gains from trade for primary producer countries were limited because  of the declining terms of trade in agriculture/commodities
66 2018-09-25 19:23:00 Expensive things can be laudable commodities if they augment our life experience.
67 2018-09-25 19:21:05 Commodities ma frend!
68 2018-09-25 19:13:59 Yuup I was on a school board. Government dumps all sorts of commodities on the school lunch programs to keep them offering $3 lunch and still run in the black.
69 2018-09-25 19:11:16 To be clear, I'm talking about mostly financial corporations. There are individuals with fiduciary responsibility under the law. I'm using it in a more general way.

It's amazing how the US has never attempted to out limits on basic needs/commodities costs to the extent needed.
70 2018-09-25 18:57:17 My issue is when or where did he say he operates  all his Business the same way as in Ghana .. Don't the market women in Ghana trade in different commodities .. we should stop this evil attitude of ours . This evil behaviour is preventing others from setting up firms
71 2018-09-25 18:52:11 Players are the biggest commodities... if the manager isn’t getting the best out of players... he goes before them these days. Far too expensive to replace a big group of players.

80 2018-09-25 18:19:00 Gold chains are an apocalypse proof play in commodities. Truly the greatest minds of our times.
81 2018-09-25 18:18:52 Yes, interesting dynamic.  That's the problem with commodities.  Type up lettuce on @rareseeds and see the amazing options.  I'm not planting lettuce in my garden next year.  I'm planting Merveille des Quatre Saisons, Midnight Ruffles, Amerikanscher Brainer, etc.
82 2018-09-25 18:15:26 Again, you keep conflating public goods with commodities. I’m all for public goods as long as they are reasonable. What you are trying to pass as public goods is a lie. Vladimir Lenin said it best, “The goal of socialism is communism.”
83 2018-09-25 18:14:36 Domestic sellers need domestic manufacturers, India doesn't have such a huge source, for some commodities you'll have some dependency.
Then for oil exploration comes ecological factors such as hill drilling where it becomes risky so it depends.
84 2018-09-25 18:10:39 *High quality person*. This is how he describes people, including Junior. It's such a dehumanizing description, reduces people to commodities, products.

117 2018-09-25 15:57:00 Prudence is what makes someone a great commodities trader - the capacity to face reality squarely in the eye without allowing emotion or ego to get in the way. It's what is needed by every quarterback or battlefield general.

120 2018-09-25 15:42:52 In Trump's statements at #UNGA I see a clear solution to India's petrol-diesel price woes. 
Looks like India is going to import US oil, at least for a portion of its needs. India could  even barter commodities for oil with the US.
Another Modi master solution! 
121 2018-09-25 15:35:28 Not all women r feminists. Women were created 2 b help mates 2 their husbands. Treat them with respect & love while keeping the lines of communication open and he should return love & respect in return. Precious commodities. Not tangible but real!
122 2018-09-25 15:33:59 Hahahaha I know a lot about Gold as commodities ... the issue here is  regularizing thier operations so what’s stopping them. As an entrepreneur you need to open your mind to compliance issues to save your business. About your aims investment I only asked of the business model
123 2018-09-25 15:33:43 Politics has only become game of blames with no focussing on any mandatory required controls by any of competant authorities with daily increase in petrol/diesel prices resulting steep increase in prices of essential commodities impacting severely to  hapless general public pl.
124 2018-09-25 15:29:04 Also remember as well, oil is always last to the party.  Yes, other commodities have long since peaked, but oil I regard as always late to the party with more beers (if you catch my drift)

127 2018-09-25 15:20:50 Understand your point and that’s not at all where I was going. What I mean is that there’s a subculture in these schools where the “in” girls are treated with respect but the “on the fringes of being ‘cool’” girls are treated as disposable commodities.
128 2018-09-25 15:18:38 Support a less capitalist reality in which your children are seen as human and not money making commodities for wealthy people that dont care whether they live or die.
129 2018-09-25 15:17:15 Talk about POTUS being interfering with the reference to oil prices. What gives him the right to dictate to other sovereign nations how to price their commodities. Telling Germany where to get their energy from. Hypocritical. One way the US way.
130 2018-09-25 15:15:28 Mano Lula pegou um monte de projeto do FHC e continuou. E deu sorte que teve a onda das commodities. Que qualquer presidente que tivesse na época iria " fazer algo" pro Brasil
131 2018-09-25 15:13:45 Too bad, my Silverado gets over 20mpg with real gas...only 16.7 with ethanol.
Not only that, an oil glut should drive prices lower.
I'm just a plumber, not a commodities trader.
132 2018-09-25 15:11:12 Today Trump spoke like a regular consumer, yes oil prices are bothering. You don't see other commodities reaching 4 year high. OPEC+ should dissolve the oil production cut. The EM crisis should not be underestimated.
133 2018-09-25 15:11:03 Con solo robarte los commodities te impacta en todos los costos del día a día... si esa plata se quedase en nuestro país, tendrías mejores condiciones para tu salud, tu educación y tu presupuesto social. En fin, el país estaría mejor.
134 2018-09-25 15:05:56 if prices for such commodities went upper, it could appear that the us soy is the cheapest one in the world, even with the taxes(this is not absolutely serious)
135 2018-09-25 15:05:32 Individual companies chart their own course. Sector dynamics DO play a role but not to a very great extent. 
Only commodities can be easily bunched together.. 

That said, i don’t really like the sector as a whole, especially HFCs 
136 2018-09-25 15:05:07 Team FSI recently spent the afternoon working with the Central and Eastern NC Food bank. We packed 501 boxes for the Commodities Supplemental Food Program to benefit Seniors in 16 NC counties. A total of 16,500 lbs equaling 13,900 meals for low-income seniors across NC.

144 2018-09-25 14:19:26 A commodities trader that can squeeze a naturopath is a commodities trader indeed.
145 2018-09-25 14:09:27 I think you could get bell for a fourth. I also believe in trading all picks in round 4-7 every yr for know commodities. Draft isn't a science.
146 2018-09-25 14:08:50 'Chinazation' of Kenya,but at what cost?Massive borrowing,grandiose projects,skyrocketing of prices of basic commodities!We are corned.
147 2018-09-25 14:03:34 What can the government buy? Stockpiling commodities becomes counter-productive after a point. Buying domestic financial assets means that the government eventually becomes de facto lender/owner of the entire private sector.  Only foreign assets are effectively “open-ended”.

151 2018-09-25 13:53:25 The power to create money should either or both:

A) reside with the government for the profit of the people

B) be based on tangible commodities readily accessible to all nations.

156 2018-09-25 13:38:05 If resources can't be exchanged to be cash, how developing nations can gain the basic impetus to develop their economy? China did not take any nation's resources, they are buying with USD,  exchanging it with more useful commodities or infra project construction, win-win coop.
157 2018-09-25 13:27:11 $ES_F at 2930 equals $146,500 per contract which is why you are  experiencing higher margins verses other commodities that mostly stay in  a range and are more susceptible to market volatility.
158 2018-09-25 13:25:48 So true in some of my darkest times you all have been my light and I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. #kindess doesn't cost a thing but is one of the most valuable commodities
159 2018-09-25 13:17:10 And what about Indian Economy, National Income, Per Capita Income, Inflation in price of essential commodities
160 2018-09-25 12:58:57 I agree. Floundering clubs need mature bodies now. Therefore it is a nonsense that these "priority picks" should be tradable commodities.
161 2018-09-25 12:58:44 Si x decisión del gobierno las tarifas de serv públicos y combustibles están dolarizadas, los commodities y alimentos están dolarizados, las viviendas y alquileres están dolarizadas, me parece razonable estimar caída de salario con esa moneda ¿por qué saltás así, @anlopez1962?
162 2018-09-25 12:50:39 Haha . Luckily I had my fair share of learnings done when I’m 18 . Thanks to reading commodities and burning hands . I’m now 22 and started sip equity in stallion asset . 
163 2018-09-25 12:49:37 I dunno why Americans care about the debt, it's by far the most powerfull country in the world, there is no debt threat since you have monetary sovreignty and US dollar is the benchmark for the commodities. Greetings from Italy

169 2018-09-25 11:58:17 Não sei onde Lula fez um bom governo. 
O fato de a economia estar bem, reflexo dos ajustes feitos por FHC e da alta demanda mundial por commodities, não o faz um bom gestor. Ele poderia, com alta popularidade e economia forte, ter feito muito mais.
170 2018-09-25 11:43:32 Smart.Intelligent,wise and experience Finance Minister who knows the role of Finance in Modern Financial world will never take option to increase the prices of those commodities which are of daily use for hand to mouth poor and middle class people BUT in Pakistan unfortunately

196 2018-09-25 09:56:56 The govt in its mandate execution allocates funds for FP services, commodities,personnel and centers et all.

197 2018-09-25 09:49:53 I agree. And commodities are always going to track (even if they lag) supply and demand economics. What worries me is that I saw the Saudis saying they won’t cut supply at this stage as there is a balance. That’s how I know we are in shit.
198 2018-09-25 09:43:01 Commodities and/ Currencies incl Crypto don't move in straight lines, eg traders took profits. Buy the dip and sell the top. The technical analysis shows we the SA consumer is in deep shit, since BCO bounced of the 200dma on 16.8.2018.

227 2018-09-25 06:48:22 Regression theorem only applies in the *absence* of existing money prices, where commodities can become collectible/SOV/MOE/UOA. With a preexisting price system, it doesn’t necessarily apply.
228 2018-09-25 06:45:07 Agree Sen. @jvejercito like the issues of inflation in basic commodities, the rice crisis that must be solved!
229 2018-09-25 06:26:13 Does that show the current commodities market is valued at less than it was in the 70’s or is it some kind of strength index?

237 2018-09-25 06:04:40 A fun idea from earlier — a GeoIP price-index commodities captcha. E.g. "What does a liter of milk approximately cost where you are?" you can both determine a likelihood that the user represents a person actually in a place, and develop a cool global commodities price index.

239 2018-09-25 05:51:45 Someone doesn’t understand difference supply-side controls don’t affect demand-side decisions when dealing with commodities in an open market (unless you increase sales tax on petrol).
240 2018-09-25 05:45:29 They can’t be that inefficient if they are able to supply one of the largest supermarkets in the UK who drive down wholesale prices. 

How much per ton are commodities such as lemons from outside the EU (ex tariffs) vs EU?

Examples please...
241 2018-09-25 05:39:31 Question: recent @Global_Witness and @AmazonWatch reports identify large-scale agribusiness as biggest cause of killings of #HumanRightsDefenders, often for expansions driven by foreign demand. How should importers of risk-commodities respond?

@landcoalition #united4landrights
242 2018-09-25 05:32:07 Australia is a massive exporter of commodities that feed China & Japan. Japan still owns the car manufactures that are located in the UK & around the world. Ditto it’s electronics industry. The US is like the EU as it relies on the scale of its domestic market.

248 2018-09-25 04:41:56 #FoodControlSystems We live in a global village with increased cross-border trade and a growing global food market. In as much as it is a great opportunity to access food commodities from other markets at competitive prices, we should be wary of risks associated with that option.

It cited the "urgent need to tame price spikes of basic agricultural commodities."

2-follow the footprints of the market at supply and demand by the institutions. Dont follow all the news.
3- find out why in a 10% return market the return is not more than 7%. Make sure the stocks, commodities are not mediocre.
252 2018-09-25 04:18:44 Today also prices of petrol and diesel have increased considerably which is a very sad state of affair embarrassing the public for all the prices of essential commodities will shoot up and the poor man’s life is a question mark the government should take immediateaction
253 2018-09-25 04:10:30 Congress people are  only worried for petrol /diesel, but not looking towards other kitchen commodities which are comparatively cheaper. Why not they drink petrol in place of whiskey for a change, which is still cheaper??
254 2018-09-25 03:40:32 Não......boom das commodities nunca foi novidade. Já ocorreu em um monte de ciclos. 12 anos de prosperidade não é efêmero. É ciclo. Se os que vieram depois desperdiçaram, é outra história. Transposição era uma ideia de mais de 100 anos. Ninguém fez antes. Faltava decisão política
255 2018-09-25 03:36:37 Mas a transposição do São Francisco não foi ideia dele! Houve várias comissões e estudos antes. Teve mérito em executar? Sim, claro, durante o “boom” das commodities. Depois de 2008, que projeto sustentável apareceu? O PAC? O Minha Casa, Minha Vida? Fazer com grana farta é fácil.
256 2018-09-25 03:35:42 Nais po namin ipaalam sa kanila na ang  mino-monitor lamang ng DTI ay ang presyo ng prime commodities at basic necessities sa supermarkets at wet markets. Maraming Salamat po.
257 2018-09-25 03:33:41 Prosperidade é algo sustentável, e não efêmero. É um processo de décadas, algo que não atingimos. Não adianta surfar no “boom” das commodities por alguns anos e depois se dizer dono de soluções que não vingaram pq a festa acabou.
258 2018-09-25 03:16:30 AO 13 states urgent need to tame price spikes of basic agri commodities, allows importation to address supply shortfall @manilabulletin
259 2018-09-25 03:16:26 Concordo. Por isso relutamos tanto em abolir a escravidão. O empresariado Brasileiro só quer exportar commodities e foda-se o mercado interno. Eu só acho estranho é que trabalhadores compram esse discurso. Como essa discussão que começou entre nós. Como alguém acredita

264 2018-09-25 02:41:55 Apart from petrol & diesel, other commodities e.g. pulses, fruit, vegetables, medical equipments, 4G data got cheaper in last 4 years. Any feedback on those items also will be appreciating. Inflation didn’t crossed 5% during the last 4 years @Shiv0689
265 2018-09-25 02:40:59 USD, and with it, the whole commodities complex. Some evidence points out considerably higher dollar (strength of ec, QT). Other (massive deficit, long term usd trend), tells us it's other way around. And I am not sure what is the balance. Could the two effects cancel each other?
266 2018-09-25 02:39:26 inteligência nos exportamos como commodities também, rs. Para mim o que falta mesmo é estímulo; menos impostos e mais liberdade para criar, inovar, menos burocracia e papelada.  Sua leitura sobre o CSF foi correta.
267 2018-09-25 02:37:12 Why do you think about your car only .. Am thinking about the trucks plying with essential commodities .. This is not the 1st time in history that crude has reached this level .. But our petrol & diesel have
268 2018-09-25 02:36:05 Qualquer presidente iria passar por esse período de prosperidade, afinal: o preço do dólar estava baixo e do Brasil oferecer commodities que foi muito exportada pela China - sendo a maior exportadora do Brasil.
269 2018-09-25 02:32:18 As commodities são aqueles pensamento de "vamos fazer bem o que sabemos fazer", esquecendo que é possível não só exportar a matéria-prima, como produzir com ela produtos de alto valor agregado.

A gente importa tudo e a produção de inovação, pesquisa e tecnologia aqui é pífia.
270 2018-09-25 02:27:09 Na minha opinião, a aposta nas commodities não é uma herança militar. É apenas onde somos competitivos. Ninguém gosta de importar produtos de alto valor agregado. Apenas não aceitamos pagar mais por uma coisa se conseguimos encontrá-la mais barata. Famigerado custo Brasil.
271 2018-09-25 02:26:29 Jefferies maintains positive on Voltas & upgrades Blue Star to BUY. Also, the brokerage believes that impact of commodities & currency will last on the sector for 1-2 quarters
272 2018-09-25 02:23:23 Não tem como deixar toda a economia de um país dependente da exportação de commodities, o Lula não pensou nisso porque elas iam bem na época, a Dilma jogou dinheiro fora no Ciência Sem Fronteiras na tentativa de trazer inovação e tecnologia para o país de forma não planejada.
273 2018-09-25 02:21:52 Com o preço das commodities lá no chão fica difícil recuperar a economia. O Brasil ainda tem aquele pensamento da ditadura em exportar commodities e importar produtos de alto valor agregado.

Enquanto essa lógica não mudar, a economia fica a mercê do preço das commodities lá fora
274 2018-09-25 02:17:29 Realmente a crise em 2008 afetou o mundo todo, inclusive o Brasil. Contudo, surfamos na onda das commodities ( Graos, petróleo e minérios) que vendíamos como nunca para a crescente China. Concordo que a crise demorou a nos afetar, mas não acha que está demorando demais a passar?
275 2018-09-25 02:15:39 Você é favorável à privatização até da Petrobrás?
Valorizar produtos nacionais? Acho que o Paulo Guedes não tem essa pauta não. Como ele vai aumentar as exportações reduzindo o investimento em ciência e tecnologia, exportar commodities é mais do mesmo, não?

    LME copper slid 2 percent to $6,227 a metric ton.
277 2018-09-25 02:03:37 Long reply but necessary for understanding ground realities - Quad is a non-starter becoz all the four partners have very different agendas. Australia is completely dependent on China for trade and essential commodities and thus while it will make correct noises, will do little.
278 2018-09-25 01:50:35 Seems like a match made in heaven, both ruthless dictatorships with complimentary assets; Russia got commodities and military tech, China got factories, consumers etc. Together with despots around the world; N Korea to Belarus, Central Asia, Iran they have got a lot to play with
