We are Africans
37 2018-01-12 23:57:37 I discovered cleansers a few months ago and they are a-maz-ing! Boots own brand cleansing wipes w/tea-tree oil & witch hazel may help (I swear by it). Also, up your zinc, vitamin E and water uptake. If you do it in general it will maintain your complexion!
38 2018-01-12 23:57:23 I want an oil diffuser please

41 2018-01-12 23:56:57 The media asks the President today Are You a Racist?

The success or failure of countries depends on the people inside them. 

If you don't think so then explain to me why Norway with its oil is a paradise but the Middle East is a backwards war-zone.
42 2018-01-12 23:56:55 Sering. Pake oil control film
43 2018-01-12 23:56:51 Western civilization combined with oil reserves per capita make it happen... But do oil reserves make norwegians so much better?
44 2018-01-12 23:56:50 Sometimes I mix lemon pepper in olive oil and add that on, but many times...yes, yes I do
45 2018-01-12 23:56:49 Raw walnuts and walnut oil contain powerful Omega-3 fatty acids that fight pain and inflammation in the body.
46 2018-01-12 23:56:38 Use of word is divisive.
Spilling the beans on use of word not divisive. 

47 2018-01-12 23:56:31 Ooh, I never add thought of "adding" olive oil, since I usually grease up the pan with that first. :D
48 2018-01-12 23:56:27 Somebody must put some oil on there while he sleeps, that's the only explanation.

51 2018-01-12 23:56:22 Democrat Durbin is after POTUS Trump like a Jihadi terrorist. Venezuela has achieved 100% literacy for citizens rich and poor. Venezuela and Cuba have achieved a great Healthcare system using a barter program of 100,000 barrels of Venezuela oil for 40,000 Cuban Doctors! Yeah!
52 2018-01-12 23:56:05 Correct
53 2018-01-12 23:55:56 Every smoker needs to invest in an oil pen
54 2018-01-12 23:55:51 So I'll stab at that Giant Elephant in the room....why Are they coming here? And if its so bad for people there....why aren't we sending our troops there to help where they are .... Instead of across an ocean to protect oil fields and poppies fields??
55 2018-01-12 23:55:38 When it's yours, it doesn't matter who submitted the application first, who applied first, who saw it first, who called first, or who got there first! The oil can't flow until you get there! What God has for you.’
56 2018-01-12 23:55:37 Well, it's good that the nyc mayor wants to sue big oil lol that's not a bad thing
57 2018-01-12 23:55:16 Just because I have a different perspective doesn't mean I am "for destroying" our country.  Our founding fathers debated for far more hours and days than our discussion, and they came to a pretty great agreement.  I think we could also find common ground to agree upon.
58 2018-01-12 23:55:12 Oh jesus. All the seed oil and carbs.
59 2018-01-12 23:55:04 The Cattle Fula have no resident state. The Bayelsa man has oil under his "land",  he didnt work for  it and he didn't spend a dime in extraction but he makes demands of the government even destroying property.
60 2018-01-12 23:55:00 But there is D. We're talking from ex-employee Bannon, Sessions, MILLER, Devos, ties of the Mercer family, KOCH Bros, McConnell, Ryan, list too long! We can't get rid of them now. We are being held hostage! In meantime Trump changing Constitution & rights! Land Oil, Environ.
61 2018-01-12 23:54:29 I have really bad dandruff and head and shoulders shampoo helps me! I really like the one with eucalyptus in it cause it makes your scalp feel minty. Anything with tea tree oil in it has the same effect and is also good for your scalp!
62 2018-01-12 23:54:09 Thanks for raising awareness about Big Oil.  
63 2018-01-12 23:53:58 Did a coconut oil hair mask then washed it out with some niiiice shampoo
64 2018-01-12 23:53:57 And we have the CASCADIA SUBDUCTION ZONE! We're supposed to be prepping for a big earthquake. How will holes filled with crude oil be a good thing when (not if) that happens?
65 2018-01-12 23:53:37 Yeah.  Venezuela has the same oil though but they can't make it work, South Americans are too corrupt.
66 2018-01-12 23:53:12 Trump donates to FL AG, she drops the case against Trump U,Trump repays her again by exempting FL from oil drilling & ofcourse Mar-alago is safe fron oil spills... Trump's corruption & self-dealing is astounding.

70 2018-01-12 23:52:12 This should be a situation where you get to opt in, and otherwise you don't have off shore drilling.  Ask the coastal state governors which of them actually want off shore drilling, and let them have it. Also, put oil spill cleanup 100% on them.
71 2018-01-12 23:52:07 So shut off the oil supply and we how popular he is then.

75 2018-01-12 23:50:56 @LushLtd I read a review that said the Oil on Troubled Water bath oil is the same scent as The Smell of Weather Turning fragrance. Is this true? 
76 2018-01-12 23:50:53 Movie theater butter is made out of oil it’s not real butter 
77 2018-01-12 23:50:48 I’ve heard nothing but good things about Macadamia Oil & how lovely it leaves your hair feeling, would love to discover its wonders for myself! Thanks for the chance #MacadamiaHairUK :)
78 2018-01-12 23:50:44 Administrative assistants/lab workers/housekeeping crews/ physical plant workers are the oil that enables the high muckety mucks  to do their jobs. Often they are invisible.

oil prices and production challenges.
83 2018-01-12 23:50:15 I shouldn’t say it doesn’t like it , I just don’t see much difference in using that from the castor oil I already like.

91 2018-01-12 23:49:03 A confined shop with possible ground nuts and nut oil without proper signage is dangerous and reckless. Would it kill you to let us know what’s in your products? Would it kill our nut allergic children? It could actually!!
92 2018-01-12 23:48:51 i'm curious about the beard oil ....
93 2018-01-12 23:48:30 Don't think the oil will finally pull it together tonight? I'm on the fence. I'm usually for ARI GPP value plays hmm. Like most of your other picks though
94 2018-01-12 23:48:25 Truth is hard to swallow,like castor oil!
95 2018-01-12 23:48:23 You do realize that there are no NYC funds in Big Oil, right?  When you buy stock in a company, your money doesnt go to the company...it goes to the person selling their stock.
96 2018-01-12 23:47:57 Time for him to stop all oil drilling and push for alternative energy like Wind and solar, we need to move forward and not stay stalled in the past
97 2018-01-12 23:47:49 Back in SM but @lizzy_rees and her oil lantern are nowhere to be found. Disappointed.
98 2018-01-12 23:47:48 Parties never switched. People saw the light.
99 2018-01-12 23:47:48 Excuse me lady in the Thai restaurant loud as heck on your phone ... #STFU!!! We don't care you're single and had to take your own car to get an oil change!!!
100 2018-01-12 23:47:47 I look forward to the time when I can. Travel = growth. I definitely don't think an unstemmed flow of immigrants is good, however, I do believe there is a compromise to be found.  Diversity is such a strength! America flourished due to the influx of fresh ideas & perspectives.

102 2018-01-12 23:47:35 Perhaps “moisturizer” is just a modern word for “snake oil”?
103 2018-01-12 23:47:17 Remember when i took a bath and i put peppermint oil in it? 
104 2018-01-12 23:47:13 If gold goes linear to $2,000; the dollar is going to have to drop like a rock to all-time record lows, below 2008. Oil will have to go straight up to $160-$180.
105 2018-01-12 23:47:11 I should've bought olive oil when I was at the store. I was looking straight at it!!!
106 2018-01-12 23:47:06 The world will never know how sad I am

109 2018-01-12 23:46:43 And oil and gas jobs.
You’re welcome.
110 2018-01-12 23:46:43 He was in power from 1999 to 2013 and his fortunes ebbed and flowed with the oil price, dramatic nationalisations of over 1000 private companies could only be sustained with the veneer of high oil revenues, once the black gold devalued he was left naked and exposed

115 2018-01-12 23:46:26 I use charcoal soap for about six months. I bought it out West when I was visiting my stepdaughter and her family. 
P.s.
I also started using coconut oil it's a beautiful thing and my number one nightly makeup remover.
116 2018-01-12 23:46:15 Looks like the Spec longs in euro and oil were Right this time. 
Simplistic and a wrong strategy to "fade the specs" automatically.
117 2018-01-12 23:46:08 Wait, so having a poker face with a motor oil pucker is a good thing?

120 2018-01-12 23:45:51 Did a rewatch of last night's @DamnationTV episode and when I paused the scene where Bessie looked at the clipping involving the Duvalls' philanthropy efforts, the clipping said that the Duvalls owned a oil company. Did I just stumble upon another bombshell? @tonytost
121 2018-01-12 23:45:31 She put her brother in law in charge of their oil production!!

125 2018-01-12 23:44:10 Literally just olive oil, butter, minced onion and cheese on potatoes. Yum.
126 2018-01-12 23:44:10 Oil companies wont be investing in offshore drilling...dont worry. They left years ago

135 2018-01-12 23:42:52 The macro reported this week are all good, we like the fact that recovering Foreign exchange reserves, 126B to 130.2B. Higher Oil, and stable IDR may lead to perfect environment for IHSG.

Yuck!
138 2018-01-12 23:42:30 Also, the reason Norway is rich is basically because we found oil in 1969 and no one came to take it from us or destabilize us.
139 2018-01-12 23:42:30 The same reason your ancestors came to this land that became the USA, "opportunities". And if you're made about people coming in your country don't go in theirs. Let's see how long will Amerika resist the itch to bring "liberty" to countries with oil and gold...
140 2018-01-12 23:42:28 I well remember when Canada wasted billions building greenhouses in the NET because of pending cooling.  And gas/oil would run out by the end of the 70s.  The game continues.

142 2018-01-12 23:42:17 This regime got it’s initial funding from Lebya, Palestine and other anti-west Movements in the region when Khomeini was in exile, before 79. Once they got control of the country, by manipulating the western media with their propaganda, the oil & gas money.
143 2018-01-12 23:42:16 Facts Snake Oil Salesman......Taxable income bonuses corps.could have given out long ago considering the massive profits corps.have been sitting on n not investing.Nothing more than marketing PR scam.

146 2018-01-12 23:41:11 What a nice city! This is the greatest handy-work of African leaders. They are corrupt to the core, greedy and tend to have 4-5 wives with 25 girlfriends. Absolutely no reason why a continent rich in natural resources including gold, diamond, oil etc. should look like a Sh!thole.
147 2018-01-12 23:41:08 I wonder how much this oil change bout to be

155 2018-01-12 23:40:20 I come from a country that puts olive oil literally in everything, I'm not about to put it in scrambled eggs!

158 2018-01-12 23:39:43 “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink in. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it?

161 2018-01-12 23:39:11 It smelled like oil was burning thru the vents and the check engine light came on again they said it’s from the accident but 
162 2018-01-12 23:39:01 Whenever I see 'massaged kale' I imagine kale going to a kale masseuse, getting a sensual oil rubdown to ambient music
163 2018-01-12 23:38:53 THE IRANIAN DICTATOR HAS MADE A BIG ASS OIL OCEAN MESS NOT A GREAT SAFETY RECORD ON THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE OCEAN!
164 2018-01-12 23:38:21 I used to use 2-3 makeup wipes a day but I hated how many bin bags I was sending to landfill (40+ a year) so I switched to using cotton cloths and grapeseed oil/cleanser and I'm so proud of myself. Baby steps to a waste free lifestyle

166 2018-01-12 23:37:54 For anyone in this situation who gets an abscessed tooth!! You really don't need to seek professional dental care!! I "SUCCESSFULLY" self-treated a severely abscessed molar tooth last year using "only" natural herbs, healthy food, coconut pulling & oregano oil pills!!
167 2018-01-12 23:37:45 @DrGundry in your book you instruct us to never heat olive oil. In your okra recipe however, the oven is set to 450F! Other recipes also have this issue (high heat + olive oil). Could you clarify? Amazing recipes nonetheless.
168 2018-01-12 23:37:32 Yeah, like most food-borne illness, it's improper handling. 
Baked potatoes taste much better to me rubbed with oil and salt and baked naked anyway.
169 2018-01-12 23:37:30 I’m out of beard oil. :(
170 2018-01-12 23:37:13 How weird would it be to stand on an Oregon beach, look into the Pacific Ocean, and see an oil rig?
171 2018-01-12 23:37:10 Meh, it has WAY more to do with British and French Imperialism. Exxon gets its oil stolen in Nigeria all the time. And the Soviets... well they backed the family of the richest woman in Africa. So... #tytlive
172 2018-01-12 23:37:02 God it would be very hot. Please do a really oil titfuck video if possible, they are so hot xxx

178 2018-01-12 23:36:34 His comment was while talking about immigration and you don't immigrate a country's economy. You don't immigrate Norway's North Sea oil reserves.

186 2018-01-12 23:35:55 Added an ultrasonic oil diffuser (it's SO ultra!) and a vacuum sealer to my life this week and currently debating which is the best thing I've ever purchased. I am so very conflicted.

194 2018-01-12 23:34:28 Not sure if it true or false and really don't care. But you have dirt on a billionaire and you settle for 130k? If it is true and is sexual in nature maybe he wanted to try some kinky shit! 2 adults agree to do what ever. None of my business! Maybe he likes his oil checked?
195 2018-01-12 23:34:13 I'm not so concerned with the oil but I burn myself on splattering grease every time I fry anything. So I refuse to do it!

198 2018-01-12 23:33:49 Let's not go down that route please, if you think "supreme" means destroying IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, LIBYA & Symphathisers of IRAN for their oil and leaving millions of lives ruined & creating more shitholes. Please don't share your political immaturity on my feed m not glorifying u
199 2018-01-12 23:33:48 Or someone that is horrified industry and government consider 17% of an oil spill clean up a "success" therefore leaving 83% oil in ocean
200 2018-01-12 23:33:46 Yay #EnvironmentalistRockefellers. If OIL companies had ANY INTELLIGENCE, they'd start INVESTING HEAVILY in Alternative, Renewable Energy. They shd Change their Identity to Energy Companies. How STUPID they've been!
201 2018-01-12 23:33:46 NO ONE SHOULD BUY THE IRANIAN DICTATORS OIL! HE HAS BLOOD ON HIS HANDS FOR KILLING THE YOUNG PROTESTERS WHO WANT TRUE FREEDOM!

206 2018-01-12 23:33:04 My family definitely isn’t from Cyprus and I definitely didn’t start salivating at the thought of adding olive oil. What? No. Not me.
207 2018-01-12 23:32:39 Same thing happened to me with olive oil.

210 2018-01-12 23:32:27 the point is they do.They produce a shit tonne of coffee.The only thing iswhen the drug gangs try to take over,they get a bunch of bullets in their throats

As for Somali.Somalia is being messed with by the US government due to the oil they found there.(why they turned to piracy)
211 2018-01-12 23:32:16 Sierra Club is also bankrolling efforts to keep Canada's oil landlocked.
212 2018-01-12 23:32:11 Or perhaps someone that values growing high tech, clean tech & tourism industries that are antithetical to Vancouver becoming major oil port
213 2018-01-12 23:32:04 When we have oil co.heads in our administration, there are motives n gvt is going 2 work 4 them. When the Dept of Ed head has $ties w student loans, gvt is going to work 4 them. It's gvt will work 4 the maj.of ppl...or spec.interests.
214 2018-01-12 23:32:03 Boy Google needs to be your new found friend. Clinton took AWAY their plutonium supply and replaced it with access to crude oil because he realized they were using the nuclear reactors for nukes and not power supply like agreed upon....So where did he support their nukes. Sad.

217 2018-01-12 23:31:37 An excellent choice. Made better by some chives and a dash of olive oil. A meal for champions.

Only a fool would disagree.

229 2018-01-12 23:30:04 This is crackers. None of that is an essential consequence of a Lab programme that is closer to the Scandinavian model than anything else. We are a £2 1\2 trillion, diverse, modern economy that prints it's own fiat currency, not a developing nation dependent on oil exports...
230 2018-01-12 23:29:58 I love coconut oil for taking my make-up off but it straight up makes my eyes blurry and blind for agessssss after
231 2018-01-12 23:29:50 We’ve been trying to get into Iran for decades to exploit their oil and resources. Let’s not bullshit ourselves here.

233 2018-01-12 23:29:47 Coming from “somalilandsky” you’re praising them because they took over berbera port  in northern Somalia? They took it over to keep it down from competing with UAE’s ports since UAE is running out of oil they want to rely on other revenues other than the oil one.

242 2018-01-12 23:28:31 If those countries knew what they were doing they would probably charge as much as they can for whatever oil they have. There are many countries with natural resources and they make shitload of money. The fact African nations don’t is why their citizens live in a shit place

250 2018-01-12 23:27:30 Question. Iraq was said to have WMDs and was invaded by the US, North Korea is testing and has WMDs, no invasion. Why is that? Oil your train of thought for a second.
251 2018-01-12 23:27:22 Those disasters will be because of OIL spills. Great job "protecting" the environment.

257 2018-01-12 23:26:25 So today I hear @NancyPelosi refer to $1000 given by companies as crumbs. Maybe to an elitist hag who spends that weekly on botox or booze, it is crumbs. To the rest of us it's a tank of fuel oil, electric bill, car payments...Do us all a favor Nancy and shut up.

266 2018-01-12 23:25:32 Lucas Oil is a cool stadium but I honestly would love for this match to be played at Carroll Stadium. It’s pretty wide open around there. They will hear @TravelingBailey coming from a long way.
267 2018-01-12 23:25:21 Statements like this damage your credibility. It’s a written version of stupid meme to make a point but only weakens your argument. Alex Jones is a snake oil salesmen who espouses vitriol to get fools to buy his worthless supplements. Raise your game.
268 2018-01-12 23:25:00 Can more people care and talk about saving the ANWR and congress’s vote to open it up for oil drilling
269 2018-01-12 23:25:00 No, actually the conservative troll network is growing. Didn't you hear Scheer saying he was stepping up his social media campaign? I'm voting Trudeau and thankful as hell to have the "take from the middle class to give to the big oil companies" Conservatives out of office

Perhaps because they have had to spend over 1 billion to achieve it?

Perhaps because it's not their money and is all built on oil money handed to them from a torturous and corupt middle east regime?

274 2018-01-12 23:22:38 Yes. Burns oil. Had both cam shafts and thermostat replaced at 3.5 years, $3k. The dealership has had it 4 weeks so far. Last Volvo for me.
275 2018-01-12 23:22:25 Manor signed Rio Haryanto as their pay driver through Pertamina (massive Indonesian oil company). However they had the chance to sign Rossi full-time, but he was demoted to reserve driver and replaced him with DTM champ. Pascal Wehrlein. Ironically, Rossi paid his win into F1.
276 2018-01-12 23:22:22 Fuck no, Arlene loves them. I find them bitter and gritty. Though I could drink a bottle of olive oil.
277 2018-01-12 23:22:10 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
278 2018-01-12 23:22:08 That's an excellent point Maude. Special interests have so much power in this country, I find it rather frightening. My state reps (Utah) are a corrupt as they come. Pro oil, gas exploration & against public lands. Even though tourism brings in far more money than gas & oil!
279 2018-01-12 23:22:06 Ah,,,,,linguine with olive oil, salt and pepper, parmesan, and onions that were cooked about an hour: bellissimo. really hits the, Spot.
280 2018-01-12 23:21:59 If I knew someone who was really good at oil painting I would commission them all the time to make renaissance style paintings all the time.
281 2018-01-12 23:21:36 I spoke by phone today with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and reiterated my opposition to his offshore oil drilling proposal. I told him the concerns of Washingtonians and West Coast residents deserve be treated with the same consideration and deliberation as those in Florida.

300 2018-01-12 23:19:30 but i dont have any olive oil
301 2018-01-12 23:19:27 Coffee grounds! Make your own with coconut oil or try a brand called Frank.
302 2018-01-12 23:19:24 I went for the cupboard. Tinned sardines, garlic, chilli, lemon, TONS of parsley, tomato, walnuts, olive oil & spaghetti. Incredibly delicious and takes the length of time it takes to cook the pasta
303 2018-01-12 23:19:23 Also, what if oil goes back to $50, or up to $100?
304 2018-01-12 23:19:19 Don't think they want a deal. 
Durbin sabotaged it. 
What else do they have 2018? 
Repeal tax reduction, kill off bonuses, slow down markets

308 2018-01-12 23:19:06 Haiti doesn't have oil, so why would Tillerson care?
Africa has oil, and his company Exxon is busy trying to get their oil, so that's all he cares about. Literally all Tillerson cares about is oil and money. Get real.
309 2018-01-12 23:19:04 Extra Virgin Oil
310 2018-01-12 23:18:55 We keep shielding d disasters, menace and pollution from the mining of crude oil and yet nothing to show 4 it in d region... May God bless us with godly leaders...

312 2018-01-12 23:18:46 Under the Alberta Climate Leadership Plan Alberta has committed to capping their carbon emissions and thus they cannot just change over to gas unless they want to curtail their oil industry......
313 2018-01-12 23:18:42 my coworkers now call me Neroli because I light up their mood like neroli oil does. precious

Olive Oil
Cocunut Oil
Baby Oil
317 2018-01-12 23:17:54 The best rice I’ve had has had 1 parts rice, 2 parts water (Does take longer tho :/ ) Sesame oil if you are making asian rices, a little bit of olive oil or butter for most any other. Should totally prevent crunchiness.
318 2018-01-12 23:17:48 True, also that oil fund comes in real handy doesn't it.
319 2018-01-12 23:17:43 OIL THAT MEAT BEFY BOI!!!
320 2018-01-12 23:17:28 I made gochujang-glazed salmon for dinner but I put too much sesame oil because it looks just like the mirin bottle TwT still p good at least. Also it was *very spicy*
321 2018-01-12 23:17:20 Do you not realize how much money the federal government has made off of making the dollar being backed by oil now that they've got their money they don't need oil anymore, and I'm not even a fan of oil I'm a biofuel guy.
322 2018-01-12 23:17:16 MY favorite YL oil is Frankincense
323 2018-01-12 23:17:01 International Monetary Fund policies, Installing dictators who give their countries resources to 1st world nations, wars for oil made those countries what they are. Racism, xenophobia, imperialism and capitalism are still very present and we need to take those things down!
324 2018-01-12 23:16:54 I’m at valvoline and the guy changing my oil is having a conversation like he knows me and he tells me I have a different cars and stuff I think he got me confused but I’m just going with it lol

326 2018-01-12 23:16:39 Still want to know if there is a boatload of oil out there.  If not, no drilling.
327 2018-01-12 23:16:30 Pull copies of building permits at Scottsdale City Hall. Check for ALL Compliance signoffs, i.e.. Environmental Impact Assessment likely Has to be done. Aqmd oil co. Credits also contestable. Who signed off on permits?

331 2018-01-12 23:15:54 Shakedown and extortion ring plain and simple.
332 2018-01-12 23:15:52 I been doing oil too

It's worthwhile
333 2018-01-12 23:15:52 Those pricks used Tetraethyl Lead instead of ethanol knowing full well that it was toxic, long before it ever went into production. The Oil company owners knew what they were doing and did it anyway.

Now the people poisoned in that way control nukes and foreign policy.
334 2018-01-12 23:15:46 Alright I just need to have a word with my vehicle for needing not only a new tire, but also a new air filter, wiper blades, oil change, and serpentine belt all at the same time
Eat my ass

336 2018-01-12 23:15:33 is that 10W oil he uses in his hair to give it that natural glow?
337 2018-01-12 23:15:29 if you make it yourself, it can be edible, even good. saute with olive oil, S&P. throw on a fried egg or two and hot sauce. pretty darn good. it will never be great, tho.
338 2018-01-12 23:15:09 Uh-oh. Corn and Oil goes down too easy this may be a dangerous Friday night cocktail.
339 2018-01-12 23:15:05 Toxic man, "you don't use the right oil! You got to use the right oil or the engine will seize up. Got to take care of the machine right"

Also toxic man, "no liberal is going to tell me how to eat, bring on the bacon!"
340 2018-01-12 23:14:58 Jamie Oliver and a ‘splash of olive oil’ might just top it
341 2018-01-12 23:14:58 They are and so is he. His imperfections don’t exempt oil and gas.
342 2018-01-12 23:14:37 it isn't because your oil club is so far ahead you weirdo looool, if you dont know football don't talk it
343 2018-01-12 23:14:37 This guy is offering hot oil booty rubs on FB. I need to find a distributor in my area. Lol

347 2018-01-12 23:14:01 The people in charge right now were steeped in it through their entire childhood development, adolescence, and adulthood until 1986.

I'm not using flowery metaphorical language when I say they were poisoned by the Oil companies. I'm being 100% dead literal.
348 2018-01-12 23:13:45 Leave and soak it. Sea salt or goddamn tea tree oil
349 2018-01-12 23:13:37 In all these scary movies when they move to a new house and spooky stuff starts happening, I always think “this is exactly why my mama anoint the house with holy oil every time we move.”

372 2018-01-12 23:10:48 The federal government has been trying to destroy this country for the last hundred years why do you think they took over the currency? Back in the day they said we should burn more oil because we might freeze to death now it's global warming now we should stop using oil.

383 2018-01-12 23:09:41 We didn't have central heating when I was a kid, just a gas fire in the sitting room. The bedrooms were freezing, I'd have to sleep wearing socks on my hands. The frost snowflakes on the inside of the windows were pretty though. We tried an oil filled radiator, it was crap.
384 2018-01-12 23:09:36 Typical, go read a book or lather yourself in coconut oil or some shit
385 2018-01-12 23:09:32 How can they keep up a weapons program when the oil revenue is slowly drying up?

Immigration now needs to slow down. I know and have see how overpopulation destroys a country. To bad u have not seen
394 2018-01-12 23:08:27 my dad gave me $80 so I could treat myself but it’s all going towards my oil change 
395 2018-01-12 23:08:22 While waiting for my oil change I had to listen to a woman bitch to the service guy about getting stuck with a flat tire and no cell phone. Because she doesn’t want a cell phone because they give you brain cancer. I am done with humanity for the day.
396 2018-01-12 23:08:19 They don't know how to cook them is why. Par boil, cut a cross into the top, stuff with garlic and oil and roast in oven. Delissimo.

404 2018-01-12 23:06:17 This evening I sat in the steam room after my swim, listen to two old guys discussing the benefits of tea tree oil. Made me smile 
405 2018-01-12 23:06:08 The people in charge of our world right now were poisoned by Oil companies for their whole lives up to 1986, when tetraethyllead was finally phased out. The symptoms of that lead poisoning are directly matched to the horrible decisions they make now.
406 2018-01-12 23:06:01 (2) where does the diamonds and all the jewelry you wear come from? Your oil???????!? Without these countries Europe and America is no better than the damn titanic.

408 2018-01-12 23:05:46 The global economy actually needs a goldilocks US Dollar just like it needs a goldilocks oil price. Not too high or too low.
409 2018-01-12 23:05:37 So my 5 days off has done nothing to help my cold and it seems to be getting worse again just in time for going back to work

It got clicks though. Guess that's all that matters.
411 2018-01-12 23:05:04 If they are shithole countries why don’t we offer their citizens an opportunity to escape and contribute to our society or do we only care or get involved when it’s oil involved, and why don’t Norwegians wanna stay there? Why do we want them here? 
412 2018-01-12 23:04:55 Let's not forget SARS and police killing those they are suppose to protect, or petrol being expensive at a oil producing country, a governor building statue worth millions while still owing government workers salary, or oh someone stealing the richest man in the world net worth.

414 2018-01-12 23:04:39 Got it. My VA doc is going to help me dance around a random drug test so I can try medical marijuana. I was told I’ll know quickly if it’s going to work or not. Marijuana Dr said I would have to try different combinations of oil, pill and tincture which is all PA will have.

429 2018-01-12 23:02:08 Honest question. Do people actually think we wouldn’t have lost jobs in resource extraction with the conservatives in power? Oil still would have crashed. People would still have lost their jobs and there wouldn’t be supports and services for those who did.
430 2018-01-12 23:02:05 This has really gone beyond euphoria and into hysteria. The similarities to silver back in 1980 or oil in 2008 are just uncanny.

434 2018-01-12 23:01:25 I just want an oil change...
435 2018-01-12 23:01:02 OIl revenues fluctuate with the trading price, the same dream Scotland had pre the indy ref was based on oil at $120 per barrel and not the actual $30 it was running at. Norways have halved in recent years, hence why personal tax levels are high
436 2018-01-12 23:00:59 because of all the oil rig workers back in the day were ruffians and it was a way to keep a lid on the town
437 2018-01-12 23:00:54 Come see why we have been voted the best smog check and oil change station in Vacaville, Ca. #smogtest #oilchange #bestsmogcheck
438 2018-01-12 23:00:48 Of course. Just thought I’d invalidate further.  As whoever wrote that clearly missed the memo on the oil content in mayo.
439 2018-01-12 23:00:34 Alberta’s oil country.....should be happy Trump won
440 2018-01-12 23:00:32 No better feeling than a shower then rubbing ya body with some coconut oil after 
441 2018-01-12 23:00:11 Couldnt just make a phone call and teleconference?
442 2018-01-12 23:00:02 inhaled a little Gerin Oil, a shot of Alosun and inhaled a little Azrael
443 2018-01-12 22:59:47 If i dont bounce back my profits till tomorrow morning ,im going start trading gold insted of oil
444 2018-01-12 22:59:26 Any country that is as wealthy as Nigeria, that has crude oil & still import fuel is a shithole.

Trumph don't owe us any apology.

446 2018-01-12 22:59:14 - 4 words needed to perfect the Irish accent ....Oil, Hooked, Beef + Whale !!
447 2018-01-12 22:59:13 We had neither (I'm 45). A gas fire. An oil filled radiator (useless imho). Oh... a paraffin heater too!!
448 2018-01-12 22:59:09 We had ok healthcare until snake oil salesman Obama and his minions wrecked it with lies and unicorn math.
449 2018-01-12 22:59:07 Exploitative labour is widespread in developing countries and in the oil rich Middle East gulf states but you're not that great on that aspect yourselves with your working conditions half a century behind the rest of the developed world and your pitiful minimum wage.
450 2018-01-12 22:59:05 Neat trick, siphon off the value of Northsea oil to share holders and corporations, and avoid giving the taxpayers any benefits. Of course when it comes to decommissioning, the taxpayers will have to stump up.
451 2018-01-12 22:58:52 Believe is my current favorite YL oil. I LOVE the scent and Way it makes me feel. I like to apply 1 drop to the crown of my head, daily
452 2018-01-12 22:58:47 I think oil was deep under ground for a reason. The worst discovery of man kind yet. Petroleum & all its by-products. This is what is wrong most of all, government's want this stuff to fly planes, with bombs or tourists. Crazy people these humans. 
453 2018-01-12 22:58:40 I think $70+ #oil has them fearing the overseas rumbling of big scary US #shale

454 2018-01-12 22:58:39 I got my precious baby oil and filter changed and tires roated. Riding like new.

459 2018-01-12 22:57:42 @CongMikeSimpson @SenatorRisch @MikeCrapo 
This week in DC
Drilling for oil, votes, or money in Trump coffers?
‘Shithole’ joins ‘grab them by the pussy ‘ in Presidential lexicon.
Brits deter POTUS, he makes sad excuse
Puerto Rico is still suffering
He lies and you remain silent
460 2018-01-12 22:57:40 It is what happened when you gave oil & gas to an European country
461 2018-01-12 22:57:31 NO, it's not safe or clean. These are out of date pollutions and cruel wasteful KILLING (seismic airguns and all testing) which we have acknowledged as long overdue to phase out and make illegal in our nation. Have you heard about electric or new solar vehicles? Try Craigslist...
462 2018-01-12 22:57:24 Giving my hair a much needed hot oil treatment while wearing a clay mask..  if y’all could see me now I look a mess lol
463 2018-01-12 22:57:10 اشتغل بواب بس ما اعيش على المعونات  و #سد_النهضة  برويك
464 2018-01-12 22:57:09 With a blown head gasket and gluggy oil to mask the noises.
465 2018-01-12 22:57:06 This guy just oozes snake oil he creeps me out
466 2018-01-12 22:57:04 You got any recipes? I tried to sauté them in garlic and olive oil
467 2018-01-12 22:56:54 only if they work for big oil
468 2018-01-12 22:56:40 Idk but I've been layering oil under my moisturizer (especially on my cheeks) because even in SF, this winter has been mad drying. Also, the Hada Labo Goku-Jyun Super Hyaluronic Moisturizing Milk has been a real life safer (and a mouthful).
469 2018-01-12 22:56:25 Dab with honey oil
470 2018-01-12 22:56:21 It’s sad when the guy at the oil change knows me by name and says “see you next month”....
471 2018-01-12 22:56:10 Want some Green oil for your delicate ears?
472 2018-01-12 22:56:02 @ChefTomKerridge just bought your new book looks exciting but where do I get ingredients like fresh fish stock, truffle oil and shaoxing wine??? #blowmybudget #keencook
473 2018-01-12 22:55:42 If you moisturise more you might find your skin produces less oil. Try two layers of moisturiser. I found it works for me.
474 2018-01-12 22:55:41 they have oil like Saudi to enrich them but something else seems to make all the difference...hmmm
475 2018-01-12 22:55:24 because the “squeaky wheel, gets the oil” I’m not good at asking for help, but we train people how to treat us. A lot of times the strongest on the outside, attract the neediest people. It’s all about finding a balance between communication, & not overwhelming yourself on Pt4
476 2018-01-12 22:55:20 that is possibly the worst excuse ive heard for anything

cause a guy who works for the CEI was also a meeting that exposes a conspiracy between environmentalists and big oil... that somehow noone has noticed apart from an english grad who works for breitbart
477 2018-01-12 22:55:02 Is pathetic politicians and media fan thse shit storms to divide ppl and the ppl take the bait. 
Founders warned of manipulation and abuse
478 2018-01-12 22:54:59 & The winner is....this dumb ass.If you withdraw your funds dont you think you will lose alot too.Think about the gold,diamond,oil,tea etc you export from Africa that contribute to your economy???But it would actually be a good thing for Africa.Mmh
479 2018-01-12 22:54:51 Being cheap and headed to selma to do my oil change.
480 2018-01-12 22:54:49 I can tell u now, millions of people across the globe would come into this country if they could then more chain migration meaning millions more. Obviously you are for slowing destroying this country we live in. Obviously u have never lived or been to a 3rd world country.
481 2018-01-12 22:54:47 Oil companies should shut off all non-contractual obligations for fuel delivery.  Let him explain it.
482 2018-01-12 22:54:38 my hair smells sooo good  forever in love with @OGXBeauty orchid oil shampoo & conditioner
483 2018-01-12 22:54:19 lol why me ? Is it good ??? Seems expensive hey . Are you using it ??? I've been using coconut oil and I'm very happy with the results
484 2018-01-12 22:54:14 For sanchi oil tanker
485 2018-01-12 22:53:42 #NP6Music. While I love Hot Chip, and I love Bonnie Prince Billie, putting them together should be oil and water. Which makes how good "I Feel Bonnie" is all the more remarkable.

487 2018-01-12 22:53:24 Office mate 1: I only like peanut butter that you stir
Office mate 2: I don't know, it has all that oil on it. 
OM1: yeah, but it's so good for you, you-
OM2: what about almond butter
OM2: do you like almond butteR?
OM1: I don't usually eat-
OM2: almond butter is pretty good
488 2018-01-12 22:53:14 On another note, that book from Catherine Millet.....shocking...Very good writer but she's no oil painting, but people were not interested in her face or intellect for sure, in the Parisian parties she used to be part of.  Unpleasant reading and I'm not prudish.
489 2018-01-12 22:53:01 how does the Mayor of New York City have the standing to sue oil companies ??

gawd damned commie turd
490 2018-01-12 22:52:47 I was tempted until I saw the first guy coated head to foot in motor oil...
491 2018-01-12 22:52:45 Folks in Rhodesia and South Africa are trying their best to add to the exception list.  And then there is Mohammed, who turned North Africa from being Rome's granary into a shithole of piracy until oil was found.
492 2018-01-12 22:52:32 You can never Mix Oil with Water thats why @IgathePolycarp resign as Nairobi City County Deputy Governor.!
@MikeSonko
@UKenyatta
@HonAdenDuale
493 2018-01-12 22:52:13 Listen... so I thought I would be frugal and buy myself a Groupon to get an oil change...$44 for a full synthetic oil change... not bad right?!
494 2018-01-12 22:51:44 From what I can remember, it’s still considered part of ore formation for some of the deposits and there is evidence for it as they have oil inclusions, but I’ll have to check on that
495 2018-01-12 22:51:25 That was very interesting. Yes, I never have the issue with cookware, I always line pans.

The cooking spray (essentially oil) did help, but didn't completely prevent the issue. It was heated in a microwave, if that changes things. 

I wonder now if it's those specific bowls.

497 2018-01-12 22:51:17 Oil cleanser?
498 2018-01-12 22:51:05 Girl at cafe: WOW, your hair is super shiny

Me: nope, that’s just oil
499 2018-01-12 22:50:46 Llevo 2 días usando el oil cleanser este y me ha hecho un puto milagro
500 2018-01-12 22:50:41 @LushLtd I want to purchase a lush face mask. What masks do you recommend for combination/oil skin?? Thank you!
501 2018-01-12 22:50:40 Such a toss up between the leaders. Might I suggest oil wrestling to decide the winner? Ewww....nevermind.
502 2018-01-12 22:50:31 Keep the chain clean, lightly oiled then wipe of the access. If you soak it in oil then the oil will mix with the grit and you get a rubbing compound that will wear out other parts. Also don't put oil on the cassette as it is the chain you links you are oiling.
503 2018-01-12 22:50:21 I mean Hilary could very well be the devil, but idgaf, I do care about his policies which are slanted to help his ceo buddies and his family like dude isn't drilling for oil in Florida but every other coastal state is okay right? You need to wake up my friend, you got conned
504 2018-01-12 22:50:15 Guys..GUYS...I got stuff done today - stuff that I’ve been really anxious about - doc appointment, oil change, emissions test, gas in the car, grocery shopping...I can’t believe it
505 2018-01-12 22:50:14 Need to be burning the midnight oil practicing 3’s and free throws 
506 2018-01-12 22:50:11 Proves dems don't really want a deal just force dem plan. Why would you malign @POTUS if you didn't have to except to undermine him?
507 2018-01-12 22:50:02 10 p after they re-drill the oil field and peeps realize they weren’t messin #copl
508 2018-01-12 22:49:51 Poul Emsbo from the USGS was pushing this idea for the Paleozoic sedex mineralization at Meikle (pre-gold), but I didn't put much stock in it. 

My question: how do you get the metal out of the oil? And do gangue minerals also precipitate from the hydrocarbons?
509 2018-01-12 22:49:36 I use argan oil. Mostly cause my dumbass bought a huge bottle and don’t know what else to do with it 
510 2018-01-12 22:49:28 To the state exempt from oil drilling
511 2018-01-12 22:49:28 Balderdash!! When Oil prices Rises our purchasing power is low and when Oil prices crashes ,the p.p is even lower. Nigerian elite 101 Econs
512 2018-01-12 22:49:27 Confit. Means boiled in oil. #wankword #NotSoFancyNow
513 2018-01-12 22:49:03 this guy at advanced auto parts is teaching mal how to put oil in my car bc her dumbass said i had some and i didnt and were on our way to virginia  LIKE WE WAS FINNA DIEEE
514 2018-01-12 22:49:03 Dip them in good olive oil.
515 2018-01-12 22:49:01 why can Norway drill for offshore oil in the North Sea, but the USA can't drill off east coast, expand in Gulf or Arctic? why can Iceland industrial fish, but USA is restricted to quotas? oh right, got to pay for socialized medicine. then it's ok to trash the environment.
516 2018-01-12 22:49:01 oh!イル
517 2018-01-12 22:48:57 Those deposits are *really* old. Seemed to me to be unlikely oil even existed at the time. Do you know if there was any follow-up on this idea?
518 2018-01-12 22:48:34 my oil tycoon started losing money ,OMG im 2 bucks off 
519 2018-01-12 22:48:29 Diet tip: replace rice with one carrot + sesame oil. HAVENT EATEN RICE IN A WEEK BITCHESEEEZZZBJSNSBZBS
520 2018-01-12 22:48:26 what if art memes also had serious art memes, like hand studies and everyone practices cool hand gestures and adds great props and whatnot
or classical oil painting/acrylic  studies
what if a meme was you becoming your fursona in a way that tells about you meaningfully
521 2018-01-12 22:48:19 Norway was once a s***hole but lucky they found oil off their coast! 
522 2018-01-12 22:48:05 Trump does not do honesty”. He’s just a real estate snake oil salesman & showman, knows how to direct conversation. You are accurate, my anger is aimed solely at Trump and not republicans generally has utilized Democrat’s quotes - as well as some republican ones.
523 2018-01-12 22:48:03 Listen to the podcast.  He has sat in on meetings between the greens and big oil as they worked together to leverage money.
524 2018-01-12 22:48:00 Oil spill
525 2018-01-12 22:47:46 They did! And black jacks thvat make your tongue look like an oil tanker ran aground in yr gob 
526 2018-01-12 22:47:45 i’m so salty oil diffusers are toxic to cats
527 2018-01-12 22:47:39 Keep your climate denial propaganda out of my timeline. Rexxon & the rest of big oil put their short term profits against the health of the planet. 
#BigOilLies and the planet dies. 

I’m with @NYCMayor @SenJeffMerkley and others fighting to protect the planet from you.
528 2018-01-12 22:47:26 Oil stains?
529 2018-01-12 22:47:16 The points that a) once oil is priced in more than one currency, EM need to stockpile USD falls dramatically & structurally, & b) once EM's stop stockpiling USD, US is on countdown to big BoP problem.
530 2018-01-12 22:47:11 If no one else has said it to you today, let me drop it on ya like hot oil popping off bacon... you're awesome.
531 2018-01-12 22:47:07 Today’s fun on the A train: left work at 4:55. 14th st platform impassibly full; still 5m to next train. Train then goes local from 59 to 168th. Service info says…delays on the E. But our mayor is going to sue an oil company so that’s global warming sorted.
532 2018-01-12 22:47:02 Try using coconut oil to remove your makeup this weekend... literally just put some on your hands and rub it in it is MAGIC!! I use it everyday as a non-toxic, nourishing, and hydrating skin treatment.... #coconutoil is the best! what can't it do!!!?
533 2018-01-12 22:46:36 Nag malfunction ulit  kailangan nya magpahid ng oil ulit and fix screws
534 2018-01-12 22:46:32 I should of just changed my oil yesterday before it started snowing 
535 2018-01-12 22:46:24 Nah, you're a serial liar, so that would be you without any values. Tax breaks that companies get as a cost of doing business are not subsidies, no matter how you liars like to spin it. Oil & gas pay taxes each year, deferred payments & drilling costs are not subsidies

537 2018-01-12 22:46:17 Yes I'm going to have her put the heated pad that they have at spas on my back before she massages me with warm oil
538 2018-01-12 22:46:14 I support you no matter how many streams you decide to do "Oil Tot". I'm your number one American fan! At this rate though you should consider singing your own theme song as the intro to your streaming.
539 2018-01-12 22:46:07 I've been seeing these oil diffusers quite a bit lately!
540 2018-01-12 22:45:51 whole house smell like hot oil 
541 2018-01-12 22:45:43 Hey buddy, don’t worry, water and oil don’t mix!! lol...
542 2018-01-12 22:45:21 I've been using vegetable glycerin on my body and Vit. C serum and argan oil on face as well as other serums. I have dry skin.
543 2018-01-12 22:45:14 It may double in 2018. China is moving to a gold backed standard and on the 18th they will stop using the Petro Dollar for their oil futures. The dollar is crashing and gold is about to get hot!

545 2018-01-12 22:45:00 Oil companies only worsen the effect of #climatechange; The Bonin-Koretz motion is exactly what LA needs to hold them accountable. 

Thank you for taking action, @MikeBoninLA @PaulKoretzCD5
546 2018-01-12 22:45:00 And just as any country is on the upswing developmentally, economically, or god forbid political stability, some coup would arise or some ‘natural’ disaster which affects food production or oil production or mining extraction etc.
547 2018-01-12 22:44:57 Anyone recommend me a good face wash product that is NOT oil based

Time to relax for 3 days
550 2018-01-12 22:44:39 My future ex somewhere sucking her husband dick right now wishing his nut ain’t taste like caster oil.
551 2018-01-12 22:44:34 Try coconut oil mixed with bicarb of soda and a bit of peppermint oil. Tastes better and is great for doing away with nasties in the mouth..
552 2018-01-12 22:44:31 My favourite Young Living Oil is Northern Lights Black Spruce it grounds me and makes me strong. #YoungLiving #RoseOil
553 2018-01-12 22:44:29 If the market moves from its current position, namely that crypto currencies are a store of value to one where that no longer holds any weight and crypto can only really have utility.

It will become very evident someone poured oil into the crypto bubble bath!
554 2018-01-12 22:44:26 I’m 11,000 miles over due for an oil change.  When will I get one? The world may never know
555 2018-01-12 22:44:25 $HNU.CA huge sell off about to happen! Dump This, it only went up based on historical high usage..new oil rigs = more ng production
556 2018-01-12 22:44:15 Let's show them Blazing Saddles...many will have heart attacks, thereby culling the herd.
557 2018-01-12 22:44:15 I mean it’s prob full syn witch u have no idea what that means but prob only cost them like 30-40 for the oil and filter lol
558 2018-01-12 22:44:11 Reminder to bring oil filter from home tweet
559 2018-01-12 22:44:05 Fine then cut off all Natural Gas and heating oil.
560 2018-01-12 22:43:57 And it just so happens to be the main currency used to trade oil the US dollar and oil is the number one most used fuel on the planet it's not a crazy thing to think that to destroy the United States economy first you got to get all of the countries to stop using oil..
561 2018-01-12 22:43:56 I am going to put rose essential oil in my bath along with some Himalayan sea salt. Rose oil attracts love for yourself and others. The sea salt will help to detoxify your body of negativity
562 2018-01-12 22:43:56 so your citation for climate change being a grand conspiracy involving everyone from the UN to the major oil companies, is an English graduate who works for breitbart's podcast with a bloke whos name you forgot.... i see
563 2018-01-12 22:43:49 Now Playing: Mono/Poly - Oil Fields
564 2018-01-12 22:43:41 Still got sore ear, dulled hearing. Taking ibuprofen & inserting olive oil. Good to see my son recovering well after lung op.
565 2018-01-12 22:43:41 Largest oil & gas reserves in Africa, still import petroleum products after 57 years of discovery, epileptic power supply, top fatalities world over in terrorist attacks behind Syria & Iraq. I live in a shit called Nigeria
566 2018-01-12 22:43:33 Wait which part?  Russells zone exits or Werenkas snake Oil?
567 2018-01-12 22:43:26 Boy, those "sh*thole" countries sure provided the world with lots of DIAMONDS, SILVER, OIL...

Africa has a large quantity of natural resources: diamonds, salt, gold, iron, cobalt, uranium, copper, bauxite,  silver, petroleum and cocoa beans, also woods/tropical fruit etc...
568 2018-01-12 22:43:26 My former husband is from an old Texas family. In his 60's...taught literature, did survey work and pipeline design in oil. He's an old fashioned Texan with that agricultural progressive streak, frustrated by irresponsibility. Not a party person.

Rex Tillerson impresses him.
569 2018-01-12 22:43:25 
570 2018-01-12 22:43:23 There's no "mass migration". We had around 3000 asylum applications last year. Lack of innovation is partly true - too much oil. Slowly changing.
571 2018-01-12 22:43:15 back to using coconut oil in my hair almost don’t know why i ever stopped until i remembered the shit use to break the sides of my face out. hoping i can keep that from happening again
572 2018-01-12 22:43:14 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
573 2018-01-12 22:43:10 it was hot enough.  it got a good sear on it.  used grape oil, higher smoke point than olive oil.
574 2018-01-12 22:43:07  I feel you. Just remember to take deep breaths & keep your peace of mind. I find meditating in the morning and lavender oil on your pressure points help reduce stress.
575 2018-01-12 22:43:07 I can’t wait until I can spend all my money on new bikinis, tanning oil, and snacks for the beach
576 2018-01-12 22:43:04 Honestly she rang me other day going on about how pretty she was I know I’m on oil painting but fuck me how does she have the cheek 
577 2018-01-12 22:43:01 Emu oil or Zostrix (capsaicin) cream oh and magnesium oil 
578 2018-01-12 22:42:54 And then I asked what sauce would she like and she said sesame shoyu so obviously I grab both the sesame oil and soy sauce and she yelled “NO SOY SAUCE WHY DID YOU POUR IN SOY SAUCE” sweetie, shoyu IS soy sauce  when I told her that she was not happy ahaha
579 2018-01-12 22:42:44 
580 2018-01-12 22:42:16 Get that stove top hotter when you sear too. I use olive oil, but not sure what's keto friendly
581 2018-01-12 22:42:10 Everything is racist.
582 2018-01-12 22:42:02 coconut oil is a game changer
583 2018-01-12 22:41:45 Yes, it is quite a theory.  One explained very well in a @JamesDelingpole podcast featuring a former lawyer who sat in on meetings between the green lobby and big oil as they collaborated.  I forget what the guy's name is now.
584 2018-01-12 22:41:37 Some years ago I was in a ceremony and I was told that tell the people there is black snake coming and it's going to all over. When translated it was oil and the paved fwy that run thru the reservation

593 2018-01-12 22:39:55 Tillerson is a spineless creep; remember, Tillerson was a favorite of Putin, receiving awards from Russia for his work in the oil industry. Tillerson is no less a Putin puppet than Trump, and Trump installed him to make sure Putin understood that Trump wold follow his orders
594 2018-01-12 22:39:52 He's paraphrasing and embellishing. Fairly obvious.

596 2018-01-12 22:39:23 2. b) Shaw Group leadership – along with allies from its oil & gas business – recognized both the threat of a Nuclear Renaissance to its primary business AND an opportunity to become an insider in a good position to help ensure its demise.
597 2018-01-12 22:39:18 Tomorrow is an entire day of spoiling myself. Starting w a 1.5 hour Swedish massage with essential oils, buying myself some flowers, then essential oil sea salt bath, scrub down with chocolate peppermint sugar scrub then  and tv for the rest of the evening
598 2018-01-12 22:39:16 i have no idea what goes on behind closed doors, but you do?

and big oil being in on the climate change conspiracy, despite climate change being specifically about the damage using oil causes.. thats quite a theory there
599 2018-01-12 22:39:07 Oil hits 70$ pb for the first time since 2014, well that's great news for our  economy!
600 2018-01-12 22:38:59 Sudocreme every night and just don’t touch it! Gently cleanse your face so it doesn’t get any oil or dirt in it to make it worse but other than that just leave it
601 2018-01-12 22:38:54 I want to know if they actually found he has a heart.  I suspect it’s more like and oil pump!
602 2018-01-12 22:38:37 Well, it depends on your body's natural oil production but like every other day should be okay? And like spot cleaning if you get sweaty or whatever.
603 2018-01-12 22:38:37 Why tf is my oil change 75$
604 2018-01-12 22:38:23 Oil works for both definitely.
605 2018-01-12 22:38:20 Sen, Murkowski sold her soul and sold out her constituents and innocent wildlife.  Do you think she cares what will happen when the inevitable oil spill happens?
606 2018-01-12 22:38:17 Scheer just needs to say a few things and stick to them:

Drop the Carb Tax.

Cut Income Taxes.

Exit the Paris Scam.

Get The Oil Sands Back in Gear.

608 2018-01-12 22:37:53 I'll have to get some. Because 3 trips to the supermarket this week weren't enough ... thanks for the tip! (I'm not sure if this is oil or acrylic or WHAT)
609 2018-01-12 22:37:40 'A roar of ancient sunlight' - coal and oil: sunlight laboriously collected photon-by-photon by millions of square miles of leaves over millions of years then processed for millions more years then exploded in relatively-speaking a split second.
610 2018-01-12 22:37:31 This is exactly why we must prevent more offshore drilling off the CA coast.  A massive oil spill like the Deepwater Horizon caused would be absolutely devastating.
611 2018-01-12 22:37:23 Isn't this the crazy woman who thinks God fills up her olive oil bottle?
612 2018-01-12 22:37:02 1 thing I hate about being an adult is going to get an oil change, I deadass waste anywhere from 1-3 hours of my life listening to kids Fuck shit up and some shitty news story from CNN
613 2018-01-12 22:37:01 Calgary farrr better city to live in (Edmonton has good parks, golf courses , arenas ) , but more southern Alberta people would live there at least temporarily due to oil/gas industry up north of Edmonton. Edmonton stores have little to no Flames gear.

617 2018-01-12 22:36:41 Come to sweden. It's basically the same (except for the oil). An American wouldn't be able to tell the difference between Sweden and Norway. Hell, it's even hard for me and I'm half Swedish, half Norwegian.
618 2018-01-12 22:36:36 Imagine think nigeria isnt a shithole. Foolish patriotism is why we're so behind. One of the biggest exporters of oil and we have national fuel scarcity AT LEAST every two years
619 2018-01-12 22:36:31 Conservatives like Andy still think they promote state & individual rights while they want to climb into every women’s womb, tell states they can’t have reciprocity gun laws, tell states they must follow Federal marijuana laws and tell coastal states they will have oil drilling!
620 2018-01-12 22:36:31 Lack of opportunity in what he was seeking. If I want to get into oil, I need to go where the oil is. If I want to play basketball, I need to go where the basketball is.
621 2018-01-12 22:36:27 Drink a shot of olive oil before you start the hot sauce..... It will help with the afterburn 
622 2018-01-12 22:36:19 Do you think Big Oil is not in on the climate change racket?  You have no idea what goes on behind closed doors.  It's not the good guy v bad guy scenario that you think it is.   As for those "scientists", they are in the pocket of grants and funding and keeping mates in jobs
623 2018-01-12 22:35:42 Only because one side sees political advantage on fanning glowing embers into full blown flame. Ppl should refuse to buy into this crap
624 2018-01-12 22:35:41 Love how Socialist Americans paint tiny country 90%+ white monoculture, oil+free market enriched Norway as being Utopia.
625 2018-01-12 22:35:38 In Misty Island Rescue, Bash, Dash and Ferdinand are running out of oil. They know it. They tell Thomas. He uses it all anyway. He just doesn't care if they starve. "F the logging locos, give me my jobi wood," Thomas exclaimed. "You're a really ruthless engine." Said Hatt.
626 2018-01-12 22:35:11 lmao, so all of the scientists around the world who state that man-made carbon emissions are heating up the earth are all part of a giant conspiracy to control people by cutting down on oil use? 
seriously, that is some Alex Jones-level on conspiracy bullshit.
627 2018-01-12 22:35:10 sleep tip: put a bit of ur fave essential oil on your pillow or cuddle stuffie for the ultimate comfy experience
628 2018-01-12 22:35:08 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this January? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

636 2018-01-12 22:33:31 I’m about to buy this oil for my hair then cut it tomorrow 
637 2018-01-12 22:33:18 With Citeh it all depends on the oil price. WTI hit $64 pb today so the oil producing countries have more money to spend on their assets versus feeding or educating their people , let alone allowing their women to vote or play football.

639 2018-01-12 22:32:49 For soap making, oil is required, but to clean oil, soap is required. 
This is the irony of life. No one is self sufficient.
640 2018-01-12 22:32:46 cmon, spurios correlation because oil fell with stronger dollar. ofcourse dollar dumped things. higher oil is still negative consumer. and do not forget NG prices are going up a lot too. cheap energy especially gas has bee a huge competitive advantage for us.
641 2018-01-12 22:32:44 After a long time I have managed to understand the FDA, they should ban it, fish oil is making me the same result as this unlikely medicine.

650 2018-01-12 22:31:33 Lord. It helps set your makeup to last longer, it helps not make it look so damn shiny, and it helps control the oil.

652 2018-01-12 22:31:13 Can I pay someone to come over, massage, lotion, and oil up my paws and then force them to adhere to them when I shrink and smother them underfoot?

659 2018-01-12 22:30:24 Na i know wym. Some people consider it ok and some don't, and it can even say sustainable but it doesn't mean that its 100%, like 30% of the palm oil is "sustainable" so they just label the product as a whole. Same w organic products, its sucks :(
660 2018-01-12 22:30:05 Just say anything to make selling Alaska's fragile wildlife refuge for oil money seem palatable.  Maybe help your constituency forget you want to kill health care so you can help diminish the $3TR debt in future time.

But we won't forget.  None of us will.

663 2018-01-12 22:29:52 Something I’ve seen in the field. I’ve been trying to get back down to TX. There are plans to fire more rigs up but a major setback right now is completions can’t keep up to the well inventory. They are in a mad hiring frenzy and just can’t keep up.
664 2018-01-12 22:29:52 Overseas countries have had no respect for "America" for decades. (ps it's the USA you don't own the continent - that's part of the attitude problem). War for oil and for USA benefit is the major attitude problem - thieves trying to dress it up as something else

700 2018-01-12 22:25:03 Actually it’s (currently) part of a research program that we take part in. All usage data is aggregated in an intranet that we can access to visualise and compare energy expenditure with each other. We don’t have any fossil fuels (oil, gas) usage at all.
701 2018-01-12 22:25:01 Start with your own country bombing them & their children daily. Add to that no food, no water, no future.

729 2018-01-12 22:22:27 i like using #CannaTonic flower finely ground & put into a tea satchel, sweeten w agave &  i braise meats w/canna butter & infuse olive oil
730 2018-01-12 22:22:24 Same as what I use, apart from the sesame oil but I will try it now. 
731 2018-01-12 22:21:47 I use oil to moisturize before makeup but i apply only a few drops and then do my brows and eyeshadow to let it sink in before i do foundation

Don't change clothes in bedroom so outside contamination don't get in bed clothes. I not had bad  throat or flu type cold since smelling rosemary oil
735 2018-01-12 22:21:14 Just found out bio oil has mineral oil in it......2018 is trying to get me killed

737 2018-01-12 22:21:10 i literally linked you the study.... good luck finding something that backs up your position that isnt linked to the cato industry and its big oil dollars
738 2018-01-12 22:20:45 So what if we use oil and gas?   They are very good fuels.  What harm are they doing?

740 2018-01-12 22:20:30 It matters greatly at the end, since all the virgins look forward to the coming of the Bridegroom but five run out of oil before He comes.
741 2018-01-12 22:20:20 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @TeamCavuto @IngrahamAngle Oil $64.40 a barrel? Liberals filling their pockets? DRILL, you’re killing the tax cuts! #MAGA 
742 2018-01-12 22:20:06 Sean just asked if we can name our future daughter Oil, so no one will date her #shitseansays
743 2018-01-12 22:19:53 It's not Haiti doesn't have resources, don't they have Gold, Oil, and food products, or has Ole Slick Willie done dipped his sticky fingers in that as well...
744 2018-01-12 22:19:51 It's time to record everything. Can't even use descriptive verbiage without being attacked. 
Durbin was paraphrasing what was said anyway.
745 2018-01-12 22:19:44 Rich added oil to his car so it’s #basicallytrue he’s a mechanic @Richzeoli @GREGSTOCKER
746 2018-01-12 22:19:29 sees a coyote:

“the oil spills are necessary.”
747 2018-01-12 22:19:19 Will coconut oil work ?

750 2018-01-12 22:19:11 Finally getting my oil change before my car dies on me
751 2018-01-12 22:19:03 Those energy mega projects aren't limited to oil and gas anymore. They can include #solar #wind #geothermal #tidal etc. Why fight against an expanded list of possible construction projects for your members?
752 2018-01-12 22:19:03 being an adult means using the $75 visa card your uncle gave you for an oil change and some cat food
753 2018-01-12 22:18:53 Gas is going up which means the oil is boomin which means more work which means a raise coming soon 
754 2018-01-12 22:18:46 Maybe it's time to change your oil ....... No pun intended ....
755 2018-01-12 22:18:39 Oil hits $70/barrel... Foreign Reserve now over $40billion... I am still waiting for all these to trickle down to the common man @NGRPresident
756 2018-01-12 22:18:35 Oh my god this guy is a joke. The republicans are simply rapists of the American people & their racism is finslly exposed for what it is. This guy trying to sell snake oil & sounds bad!
757 2018-01-12 22:18:35 It's... Actually difficult to dissect this many fallacies in two sentences.

Suffice it to say the major oil companies being divested from operate in Russia as well.
758 2018-01-12 22:18:29 I haven't used it in the summer but i wouldn't bc its kinda heavy that but would be annoying to me mixed w heat lbvs but i use this whipped argan oil by Josie maran and idk where that's from. My mom gave it to me
759 2018-01-12 22:18:25 In the US they have palm oil so double check the back :)
760 2018-01-12 22:18:19 Because #Norway is an astonishingly boring place to live/visit and is cold, dark and depressing!  But they have oil and great ski jumping - that's Nice!
761 2018-01-12 22:18:08 is there a several trillion dollar industry invested in not doing anything that would limit the production and use of oil/coal/gas?

yes there is
762 2018-01-12 22:17:48 This is why I'm in school for marine biology. If the orange antichist gets his way with ocean oil drilling and removing protections for animals though most marine life will die! Get ready for mass extinction
763 2018-01-12 22:17:42 For the crust I use rice flour, a little sugar, yeast, sesame oil and water x
764 2018-01-12 22:17:31 Interesting fact.  The lower an African country's tax collection capacity when the Berlin Wall fell, the more likely that it is a democracy today (based on Polity).  Not just oil either - this holds when excluding oil producers
765 2018-01-12 22:17:28 i'm finally feeling in the mood to paint one of these weekends and from what i've read oil paints are only dangerous for cats if they consume them, but do i really trust my 5 month old kitten not to lick any
766 2018-01-12 22:17:20 okay yes the oil is definitely a key aspect
767 2018-01-12 22:17:11 We will host any RubberMaid, Advocare, Essential Oil parties at our store. However we will not sell Pure Romance. Tammy gets offended easily. That’s the dirty, dirty stuff.
768 2018-01-12 22:17:06 In butter or olive oil?
769 2018-01-12 22:17:04 Really not that big a deal. @energysmartohio has a time at temperature curve. We were not inconvenienced by it (on the Bolt...)
Not sure it'd be great if you lived someplace with crazy cold weather all the time

OTOH, places like Alaska have plugs all over for oil pan warmers.
770 2018-01-12 22:16:58 He's afraid of it unless we get the OIL, and if I wasn't this week John Paulson just fired?
771 2018-01-12 22:16:56 I'm pretty sure most of my days I come home from work smelling like grease and oil. #notevensorry

778 2018-01-12 22:16:20 Ok, then.   Page 140:  Ingredient list includes 3 Tablespoons vegetable oil.  Step 2 instructs to heat 2 tablespoons and there is no mention of what to do, if anything, with 3rd TBSP.   (You keeping track of these?)
779 2018-01-12 22:16:05 I’ll do that Chris.  What is the difference between those and CBD oil?
780 2018-01-12 22:16:05 Lmaooo this woman has been waiting for an oil change for 10 minutes and she’s already complaining to the employees. People act so fucking entitled when they go places just be patient you’re not the only customer

784 2018-01-12 22:15:05 'Esso' was a filling station that was derived from 'S.O.', short for Standard Oil.  I finally figured that out yesterday.

793 2018-01-12 22:13:19 Life tip: ladies, if you have naturally curly/dry hair, a pea-sized amount of penetrating oil/serum will work WONDERS!!!! Your hair will be as soft as silk, this has been a PSA
794 2018-01-12 22:13:15 Next door in Blue Minnesota, they are the best run state in the nation. Same demo as WI, neither has oil or gas, easy to compare, MN wins.

805 2018-01-12 22:12:26 and then the manga crashed and burned like fire and oil. I wish I never read it... the anime left such a good impression and that all went to hell. :/
806 2018-01-12 22:12:17 Why is it a good idea to continually increase production of oil that is losing money?
807 2018-01-12 22:12:16 I really hope I can sell this piece I need money for more oil paints
808 2018-01-12 22:12:13 $GBR $2 Pt on oil $CHFS will go up conference $NXTD $NXTDW spike will come linked to #bitcoin $CNET 70% EPS increase on fidelity scanner
809 2018-01-12 22:12:11 wow I was going to ask the same question ok well I just don't do too much to it let it be a free soul (the hairs as a whole) and just use some good quality oil in your hair when it's wet after the shower (not too much) and let it just dry. down. not in a bun. (I do that though)
810 2018-01-12 22:11:57 How’d those solar panels and wind turbines fair?  Solar panels buried in snow, and wind turbines off so their blades don’t shear off. Oil oil oil. Dig baby!

815 2018-01-12 22:11:14 The newest trend in skincare: flumph juice-infused hair oil
816 2018-01-12 22:11:11 So beautiful and I never want oil drilling in their habitat!
817 2018-01-12 22:10:57 Wish they did. I reckon olive oil would probably work.
818 2018-01-12 22:10:57 I should have added that I use a cast iron dutch oven and fry some chopped bacon or cubed salt pork in it first. Leave it (along with the fat) and reduce the oil a bit, following the recipe from there. Careful not to burn the bacon/salt pork.
819 2018-01-12 22:10:34 Obviously the President knows nothing about Haiti, but he’s also totally ignorant of Norway.

Norway was a poor, marginal country until it discovered oil in the North Sea. It then socialized that wealth. It now takes in more refugees per capita than any other NATO nation.
820 2018-01-12 22:10:17 This stuff in the first ep of last season's "Worst Cooks in America" is MINDBLOWING. A woman had BABY OIL in her food.

832 2018-01-12 22:08:52 NYC Mayor. What are you doing to combat climate change? We're going after the oil companies to get them to pay for the damages they've contributed to.

846 2018-01-12 22:07:02 Why weren't the Republicans behind the verdict in the Saddam Hussein Trial a couple of days before the 2006 Midterm Elections?
Because they were so busy fixing the price on oil!
847 2018-01-12 22:06:48 10 Million or more Americans work in the oil industry.  The oil industry contributes $290 Billion dollars in income tax revenue alone....  ????

853 2018-01-12 22:05:21 If you haven't seen it have a look at Prof Ian Stewart's Planet Oil. It was on Eden recently and shows how far the UK and US went to get a source of oil. Quite an eye opener. Unavailable on BBC, probably a coincidence. 
854 2018-01-12 22:05:21 If NYC wants to fight big oil, then stop all car, truck, bus and jet traffic.

But we both know that won’t happen.

857 2018-01-12 22:04:26 Why is it unique? Is it because there is way more off shore boating and other commercial activities that a oil drill would ruin the scenery?

864 2018-01-12 22:03:35 Alright. Recooked my favorite Chinese dish again, some marked improvements. A. Use different oil, way higher heat. B. Cook less at a time so it doesn't strip the heat out of the oil.

880 2018-01-12 22:01:31 No one can take away what he did in the past. But I disagree completely that you can explain away his actions. I don't use the terms lightly but the man is a scam artist snake oil salesman

884 2018-01-12 22:01:08 It's what 100% choc tastes like, even the Montezuma's 'absolute black' with orange oil. Turns your face inside out.
885 2018-01-12 22:01:00 I'd have it in a bowl of truffle oil as a dip for Focaccia bread

890 2018-01-12 22:00:22 And city fans nowadays love the smell of oil 
891 2018-01-12 22:00:14 2 hours for an oil change
892 2018-01-12 22:00:13 @mrbinnion Terrific isn't it! As we sit in the Cdn cold, held hostage by politicians/activists, paying $$$ for unethical oil, carbon taxes, why don't I feel warmed by the smugness emanating from the first in the list?
893 2018-01-12 22:00:12 Warner, Kaine & the Va Dems in House - Scott, Connolly, Beyer, McEachin - ask Zinke to consider local opposition to off-shore drilling and exempt Va, like Fla: "In a time of relatively stable prices and booming oil and gas production elsewhere, the risks outweigh the benefits"
894 2018-01-12 22:00:09 Really is a derangement syndrome. Seizing on a word that describes an obvious truth. They hate this man so much. Blinded by it.
895 2018-01-12 22:00:09 What the hell, Gus

Also I'm pretty sure her dressing is going to break because she didn't mix in the oil slowly

900 2018-01-12 21:59:42 Exfoliating then using vit E oil >>>>
901 2018-01-12 21:59:39 
902 2018-01-12 21:59:24 1.) All planets in our solar system have been displaying striking changes in recent years. 2.) Our solar system has been moving through the "Local Fluff" which is an interstellar cloud. The whole solar system is effected. The oil companies are not the cause.
903 2018-01-12 21:59:14 People can be so gross.
904 2018-01-12 21:59:01 When I was divorced a few months ago I realized I'm going to need a really sturdy, quality pan for daily use. I found it in your optimal technology pan. No butter or oil needed, cooks enenly and to perfection. Thanks Tfal! @Tfal_Cookware
905 2018-01-12 21:58:49 Maybe she wants a three way, after which you both get shot in the face after shooting her in the face...if you’re picking up what I’m putting down
906 2018-01-12 21:58:48 Oil change done, Truck is washed, interior cleaned, tailpipe polished, and now she's leaking coolant gotta love owning a ford
907 2018-01-12 21:58:45 ياربّ الجنه
908 2018-01-12 21:58:43 If your president is a moron and Republicans are corrupt and all are greedy enough to turn our land into oil fields. You might live in a dictator ruled shithole.
909 2018-01-12 21:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
910 2018-01-12 21:58:33 Nothing per se, I think some Americans may feel that Trump has given too much to the oil and gas industry as in 90% of US coastal waters, including previously protected areas of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans.
911 2018-01-12 21:58:07 Bushes were already oil tycoons
912 2018-01-12 21:58:01 Honda's are too low for oil changes, the oil filter for rangers is in Narnia, and Tacoma's oil filters are puzzles
913 2018-01-12 21:57:53 This new body oil & spray from bath & body works >
914 2018-01-12 21:57:45 It’s only a torts exam if the rental car agency also invites me back to make a report and I slip and fall on an oil slick on my way in.
915 2018-01-12 21:57:43 Eating at Sears Auto because I knew my oil change would take forever so I brought a snack. 2018, you will not win. I am prepared for your tricks.
916 2018-01-12 21:57:42 The Alberta oil industry has some powerful enemies. Not all are foreign. All are despicable, however.

919 2018-01-12 21:57:18 Pretty successful day so far. Had lunch w/Maria, did my eyebrows and just got my hair cut. 
Now to go do my oil change for my car.
920 2018-01-12 21:57:13 The mechanics that change my oil and rotate my tires just loooooove to laugh at how small my car is and how they could lift it if they tried 
921 2018-01-12 21:57:12 should i season it or nah? (i’m putting it in ramen with ginger, garlic, soy sauce and sesame oil flavors)
922 2018-01-12 21:57:06 I'll see your murder threat and raise you a rape and murder threat. Par for the course as a conservative woman online.
923 2018-01-12 21:57:03 I’ll try that, I normally just use rapeseed or Olive Oil
924 2018-01-12 21:56:55 ...there is a temptation to say don't eat (cooked) cheese. I wonder why would happen if you wiped a very thin layer of oil over the bowl before putting the food in. Or perhaps you could warm the bowl with water 1st? I've seen cheese baked on to cookware but not tableware. (4/end)
925 2018-01-12 21:56:55 1970s oil crisis: bought new, the Ferrari Daytona was about £138k in today's money. By 1975, it would have lost more than 70% of its value.
926 2018-01-12 21:56:51 "...but as long as the President keeps signing #DonorRelief bills like the #GOPTaxScam that include deals like #ANWR to satisfy my large donors in the oil & gas industry, I'm good." - Lisa Murkowski, U.S. Senator, Alaska and BIG OIL TOOL.
927 2018-01-12 21:56:49 I don’t understand the amount of oil some people cook with
928 2018-01-12 21:56:49 lmaooo I left "local" out of that tweet and y'all are letting me have it because I support Man City. Leave me and my oil money club and alone respect people's privacy
929 2018-01-12 21:56:20 بنات أدور mattifying/oil free tinted moisturiser نوع زين . اللي ألاقيهم oil free عقب كم ساعه وجهي يصير يلمع من الدهن 
930 2018-01-12 21:56:16 The shithole should expel those US companies exploiting our oil to cobalt, and let's export to Europe/China
931 2018-01-12 21:56:01 Oil @ new lvls since Thanksgiving 2014. Big moves coming in Black Gold.
932 2018-01-12 21:55:57 And that is why we follow Jimboman, he knows how to trade!
933 2018-01-12 21:55:51 *insert joke about shrek's cologne here* I'm def going to stick with the oil first and see if that works before moving onto potentially smelly options hahaha
934 2018-01-12 21:55:37 Oil change  
935 2018-01-12 21:55:19 TSA took my Tea Tree oil  that bottle was 8.99 playa
936 2018-01-12 21:54:57 I can’t imagine anybody having to say that to you, Will.
937 2018-01-12 21:54:57 Yes to black seed oil and mask but no to vibrating massager
938 2018-01-12 21:54:49 I’d like to commission an oil painting of you two embracing. Ya know, for science.
939 2018-01-12 21:54:40 lol looks like crazy lady sent you and @Oil_Guns_Merica the same DM. Nice.
940 2018-01-12 21:54:37 Note that's where they all get there oil, diamond, gold, and billions of tons of other minerals from and don't pay or give back. We're the ****holes
941 2018-01-12 21:54:31 I agree. Once the oil and gas is gone what will they do?!
942 2018-01-12 21:54:27 Yep. My parents house is really old and every now and then the mice attempt to move in so my mum puts out the peppermint oil and they leave.
943 2018-01-12 21:54:19 And major russian indices did even better, because RSX is underweight oil stocks compared to most benchmarks.
944 2018-01-12 21:54:16 @Richzeoli obviously your arm wasn’t too bad to put the oil in the car!   
945 2018-01-12 21:54:11 Why is that Walmart takes forever to do a damn oil change
946 2018-01-12 21:54:09 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
947 2018-01-12 21:54:09 Extracted oil from Go-Circle plastic
948 2018-01-12 21:54:05 You are absolutely right. My pain is that d oil $ from South south is being siphoned by the Fulani leader to execute this evil Jihad.
949 2018-01-12 21:54:02 Shitholes.  Sure, there are lots. Question is, who dumped on the floor? 

Big turds include sanctions, trade embargoes, WTO, regime change, the troika, the military industrial complex, big oil, systematic disadvantaging of developing economies, resource grabs....
950 2018-01-12 21:54:02 Different times them..no abramovich or oil sheiks then
951 2018-01-12 21:53:54 65 Million Years is a long time, now mankind was just a fish, I mean we hadn’t climbed out of that tree in Rift Valley and to think mankind’s lived 3 Million years without increasing carbon levels. Until the beginning of 19th century oil, coal and forest burning 200+ yrs 400+?
952 2018-01-12 21:53:52 Most of it will be combined in the spring, lose some yield and oil pH drops but still a crop to be had.
953 2018-01-12 21:53:50 @Oil_Guns_Merica  got one too
954 2018-01-12 21:53:40 Because you know each oil tycoon carefully handcrafted every dinosaur carcass with care several million years ago, knowing they would "deservingly" reap their rewards thousands of millennia later.
955 2018-01-12 21:53:38 You know what it is.
Mikee Oil, Mikee Oil
956 2018-01-12 21:53:33 Oil change done  Now I just wish it wasn’t raining so I can clean my car
957 2018-01-12 21:53:33 you must have been advocating violence to deserve that 
958 2018-01-12 21:53:28 Yes that so called money club is Manchester United and is managed by a top manager Jose. And of course let us all forget city have pep because of oil money.
959 2018-01-12 21:53:11 I feel stoned but i’m not stoned so that’s cool I love CBD oil
960 2018-01-12 21:53:09 Abeg tell me which kind oil u use?  I need that oil too to fry plantain for long
961 2018-01-12 21:52:53 About 100 years ago, when Norway was still poor country without natural resources....Then they found oil and gas. Now it is one of the richest countries.. No need to move away anymore.
962 2018-01-12 21:52:41 It'd be one thing if we were performing peace keeping missions and not holding oil for ransom
963 2018-01-12 21:52:11 Most European countries got its wealth from its colonies its owned trading in materials that were not native to its land. You forget that there’s people from oil rich countries that’s are highly knowledgeable and skilled from those African countries.
964 2018-01-12 21:52:06 That is exactly what they think universities are. That and the place to find new technology to drill oil. #ableg #abpse
965 2018-01-12 21:52:00 I identify as a blonde woman today and I take my car to a shop to get the oil changed, so Democrats will eventually give me oil stamps so I vote for them and I'll never have to learn how to change oil like white supremacist @Richzeoli
966 2018-01-12 21:51:48 this oil change got me driving crazy, I gotta slow down.
967 2018-01-12 21:51:47 I need to buy beard oil because my facial hair gets hellaaaaaaa itchy when it grows back
968 2018-01-12 21:51:45 ...loss of healthcare or poisoning from toxic tap water due to deregulation? Offshore oil spills? Earthquakes due to fracking? So many other things because of what he's doing. His negligence may not be construed as genocide but it is intentional and 2/
969 2018-01-12 21:51:43 @PeterLBrandt whats your 2018 outlook for oil ?

971 2018-01-12 21:51:33 Irving Oil VP and COO Mark Sherman says this particular one is about 40 years old. It was installed around '77. Refinery was built in 1960. Different portions changed out all the time, he said. This part was re-rated within the "last few years," and "was in good shape," he said.
972 2018-01-12 21:51:32 My car got a new wheel bearing, new battery, and an oil change this week.. expensive but now it doesn’t sound like a chainsaw when I turn my wheel

974 2018-01-12 21:51:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
975 2018-01-12 21:51:15 How I come in JUST for an oil change and walk out spending $180? 
976 2018-01-12 21:51:06 We’re totally normal and likable, just read our 538 page historical book and talk to our 18 year old Elders! Then wear these magic underwear to learn handshakes and bless people with cooking oil.
977 2018-01-12 21:51:03 Late night supper. Whole roasted herring with olive oil, lemon and pepper. So simple. Mmmff.
978 2018-01-12 21:50:50 Yeah! Who needs to breathe? Or have clean water? Who needs seafood not contaminated by oil? Who cares if we make this place an absolutely unlivable hellscape? Who cares if we make corporations treat their employees like people? Or follow the law? Surely not the American people.
979 2018-01-12 21:50:30 Finally got my jojoba oil 
980 2018-01-12 21:50:12 Your Rosehip Triple C & E Firming Oil is great for hydrating Winter skin. #EminenceWinter
981 2018-01-12 21:50:11 Zinke, no oil drilling off Florida. Reason; might ruin tourism. Not!! Owner of Mara Lago does not want to look at oil platforms. (real reason)
982 2018-01-12 21:49:45 One snake oil salesman, to another.
983 2018-01-12 21:49:29 
984 2018-01-12 21:49:21 Also; why would Norwegians, who have a social democracy, free healthcare, the state gets income from crude oil sales, want to move to the U.S. where they don’t have those things?
985 2018-01-12 21:49:18 alternatively you can buy beard oil and join the ranks of beard snobs
986 2018-01-12 21:49:13 Every time I bring my car for an oil change I always want to leave with a newer model. 
987 2018-01-12 21:49:09 Imma get real pretty one of these days and oil my whole body up and take some fiyah ass nudes just cuz
988 2018-01-12 21:49:00 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
989 2018-01-12 21:48:56 I heard it's good. From my parents - my mum started using coconut oil for frying. But, when I wanted to follow my (bad) habit of scooping rests fron the frying pen to eat, together with the remaining fat, she screamed me away from doing it. Saying it's a coconut oil. :)
990 2018-01-12 21:48:54 Olive oil, garlic, sea salt and black pepper 
991 2018-01-12 21:48:52 @wheeliedealer did you see the change in #ROR new CEO and rising oil price = better growth
992 2018-01-12 21:48:51 What id wrong with oil and gas exploration?
993 2018-01-12 21:48:50 The investors didn‘t pump money to lose money but to earn money. And I was talking about exploitation of people, of resources, of food through the centuries. American wealth is also grounded on slavery, on killing indians, on wars (like the oil war in ).
994 2018-01-12 21:48:42 100% pure unfiltered argan oil made by the hands of Moroccan virgins at a female cooperative just outside of Essaouira.

1000 2018-01-12 21:48:22 I have an idea, can someone ask the CEO's of all these OIL companies to CUT OIL from NY....see how De Blasio keeps New Yorkers warm with frigid temperatures...he will learn the true meaning of "Global Warming" they will stick him in an OIL Furnace
1001 2018-01-12 21:48:22 Just poured olive oil in my ear, AMA

1004 2018-01-12 21:47:23 Question - once Scotland is independent what will happen when our oil and other assets are not there to subsidise London?
1005 2018-01-12 21:47:14 @realDonaldTrump You are trash. You are what would happen all the spray tan oil waste in the world was brought together and then became sentient. Your sentences often don't make sense if you follow conventional grammar rules. I dislike you greatly.
Fuck off.
1006 2018-01-12 21:47:11 A good sign. In 2010 I met with many "experts" + asked what impact would be from shut off of dollars flowing overseas for oil. Only Louis Gave got it at all.
1007 2018-01-12 21:47:08 Really america take the gold and oil and history and about 9/11 you can watch there are many pepole explain what happend and you can begin with the architect of the bulding and then try to find explination about insurance on terrorism before 6 month
1008 2018-01-12 21:46:57 I used coconut oil for the first to remove my makeup yesterday . I was so satisfied .
1009 2018-01-12 21:46:54 Oh wow

1033 2018-01-12 21:42:48 I massage my face with cozy almond oil   it’s super cool
1034 2018-01-12 21:42:48 Just paid @Midas $33 to change my oil, and I provided the oil and filter. Thought they rotated the tires too. 
1035 2018-01-12 21:42:48 Honestly, Senator, do you really like Zinke cares even a teeny bit about the beauty of the American landscape? He sees beauty only in fossil fuels, oil co execs and his burgeoning net worth.
1036 2018-01-12 21:42:46 That’s because in the 19th century Norway had crop failures, drought, disease, and a repressive government that denied religious freedom. Now they have oil, potatoes, and socialized medicine.
1037 2018-01-12 21:42:46 OMG I have been putting rosehip oil on my ends and it is a godsend! They get so gross and tangly and no matter how much I trim they stay that way but now they are smooth ;-;
1038 2018-01-12 21:42:41 I did mine I olive oil,sea salt & pepper then tossed them in fresh mint and lemon juice. Delicious
1039 2018-01-12 21:42:37 Domestic petroleum speculation rose to another all-time high of 625,467,000 barrels. This is 78.19% of domestic petroleum inventories.  Producer hedging is also in record territory.  Oil rigs increased by 10 to the highest level since September.  AND prices increased.  ???
1040 2018-01-12 21:42:33 The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts disagrees, but probably a blue state libtard, right? And the CBO scores direct subsidies, but the government is controlled by the GOP and we all know how they shit on big oil...
1041 2018-01-12 21:42:23 Als ik olie gebruik is t dan van healing oil of een mix van cocos,almond en olive(hair food van salon pro)
1042 2018-01-12 21:42:10 I feel like people forgot cocoa butter is the real OG for the skin. We all grew up using that and we had baby flawless skin. Fuck putting coconut oil, moisturizers on your face.

1044 2018-01-12 21:41:51 Rural Worcestershire politics is probably the best topic for you big guy. BP don't actually have too many platforms anymore. It's Scottish Oil.

1049 2018-01-12 21:41:20 Most men need not exfoliate because shaving generally accomplishes this naturally. As for moisturizer, possibly. If you do, get one w/SPF. Use it liberally. Every day. Don't forget your hairline area & ears. I like @neutrogena Oil Free Moisture SPF 35.
1050 2018-01-12 21:41:19 anyone know of a quality (& cost friendly..) place to get an oil change in sd???? pls help

1052 2018-01-12 21:41:09 someone told me one of their friend's mom's would cover her nipple with green eagle oil before breast feeding. I felt a surge of Viet pride in that moment.

1054 2018-01-12 21:41:07 Blitzkrieg! Up strongly at the open and just kept going. Best two week start ever for Dow and S&P.

1055 2018-01-12 21:41:04 I lived in Russia for 2 years drilling oil wells. Absolutely a fabulous place with excellent fun loving people.

1072 2018-01-12 21:39:15 Maybe it’s like oil in the 1970’s and it’s just that it used to be cheap and now it won’t be — I don’t expect much productivity growth for daycare workers, for example.

1077 2018-01-12 21:38:20 Geo Washington grew what is now known as Industrial Hemp. It's a wonderful product. It has many uses INCLUDING the Hemp Oil that is touted as a medication. Marijuana is ENTIRELY different. You can't make gobs of money on hemp, you can on marijuana. It's that simple

1079 2018-01-12 21:38:08 very superior granola. infused with orange oil & scattered with chocolate chips
1080 2018-01-12 21:38:01 let’s just be honest with ourselves, I highly doubt the us is ever going to go to a full electronic system, the oil companies are way too big and too much of an influence to allow it. plus the cost of these cars are extremely high unpractical for the common person
1081 2018-01-12 21:37:46 Here's a map of where Walmart is closing more than 60 Sam's Club stores With Oil jobs down They've tried to kill our resource based economy.

1082 2018-01-12 21:37:40 US investments in oil, IT, gas, mining? Try again. US companies played limited role in Norwegian oil & gas, begged to get in on the action.

1089 2018-01-12 21:37:08 I am referring to a place...not people.  I am stating a fact.  Just like stating that parts of rural Texas (old oil mining towns) have been neglected and abandoned.  They are "shitholes", that doesn't mean Texans are shitty people.
1090 2018-01-12 21:37:04 Obama' war on coal, oil, natural gas, financial institutions and his draconian regulations on all aspects of the economy destroyed economic growth for 8 years. It was only partially salvaged by Yellen's actions at the fed. She deserves our praise.

1144 2018-01-12 21:30:45 Primary case (drive chain between engine and transmission) has its own oil supply, which in theory is separate from the other two. In practice, I think a bit of oil is supposed to sneak past the bearing seal between gearbox and primary.

When will people stop using peanut oil or nuts in veg/vegan foods?? Why don’t they tell you wtf is in their granola!! It’s a popular allergy tf

1151 2018-01-12 21:29:48 Need to get beard oil for my man. Question is will he use it?
1152 2018-01-12 21:29:33 I  @AtomicAutoPDX — where else can you get an oil change and pull Hunter Thompson off a bookshelf?? Reading Showdown in the Pig Palace from Generation of Swine— a timely read. If you own a #Saab Travis is the most honest mechanic anywhere. #PDXmechanic
1153 2018-01-12 21:29:30 Yeah, just one name that proves you have nothing. Weinstein? Seriously? You're just grabbing people from the headlines. I thought you would go for some oil tycoon or something. You're not even trying. The notion that Weinstein "rules" the U.S. is literally laughable, so I laughed
1154 2018-01-12 21:29:27 Oh then they show me my oil level- “oh awesome that’s perfect!” 
1155 2018-01-12 21:29:20 They aren't listed because they might be cooked either in the same oil or on the same cooking surface as non-vegan items.
1156 2018-01-12 21:29:19 That was not a "religious" adviser. That was just another snake oil salesmen defending their own.

1159 2018-01-12 21:29:07 @Richzeoli if your dipstick comes out of a Swiss hole needing more oil, you did it wrong.
1160 2018-01-12 21:29:00 Wet first then use baby oil lotion.
1161 2018-01-12 21:28:54 You could try the disposable wax variety- they seem to gather up a little oil, and you'd replace every night (or possibly rinse and reuse if they're in good shape).
1162 2018-01-12 21:28:49 Whenever they ask me questions at the oil change place I panic... my mileage? Ummm...12?! Turn on my engine? *pops trunk*
1163 2018-01-12 21:28:44 It's not oil prices hurting the province? Is that why the recession started when the PCs were in power? Is that why the economy is improving significantly, despite the price of oil still not being where it was at the height of the bubble?
1164 2018-01-12 21:28:31 So cars, sports, home improvements are the only things u don't know about @Richzeoli ? How about Math! Forgot about the numbers again, including how many quarts of oil ur engine requires! @Himself3909
1165 2018-01-12 21:28:31 *Squeegees a half pint of oil and some paint into the rug* Sorted.
1166 2018-01-12 21:28:30 Ja, jeg hadde bodde der før. I am aware of Norway and Sweden and yes Norway is very wealthy from the oil fund, but people are still immigrating to the US from Norway and Sweden. My brother in law being one of them.
1167 2018-01-12 21:28:09 Btw..what we have built our country on the last 30-40 years is basically oil and gas..guess who found it for us..the United States..trough the Marshall help..we shure as hell didn't have the technology to find it back then..
1168 2018-01-12 21:28:06 I appreciate my dad so much! I just came to get my lock fixed on my car. He ended up changing my tire, oil, and did some detailing... THEN handed me money to go get it washed. Sheesh 
1169 2018-01-12 21:28:05 So CNN wants us to be more like Norway? Less diversity and more oil drilling?
1170 2018-01-12 21:27:57 @UnaPurdey51  Got any Peanut Oil........
1171 2018-01-12 21:27:47 Have you forgotten that the change in the price itself happens as a result of changes in the demand/supply of crude oil. Remember the price is not arbitrarily fixed rather it's explained by the interplay of the market forces.
1172 2018-01-12 21:27:39 Do I not need a certain kind of oil lol
1173 2018-01-12 21:27:32 “Hi,car. How are you? Anything I can get for you? Gas, oil, tire check with front end wheel alignment?Anything you want!”

1174 2018-01-12 21:27:31 The snake oil salesman quickly changed the subject to his family's trek to the US. The GOP continue to condone the undignified & disrespectful behavior of Trump so they can continue their reversal of Obama's accomplishments.
1175 2018-01-12 21:27:28 @Richzeoli @GREGSTOCKER Maybe we could get NJ to pump oil also!?
1176 2018-01-12 21:27:28 Yes, #Scheer was a Waiter, then Insurance Salesman for a short time, then into politics. Like #Harper who was only ever Mailroom Clerk at Oil Company (dad got him job bc didn't want him home when dropped out of Univ) before he went into politics.
1177 2018-01-12 21:27:27 Anal responses are permitted :) What sort of oil do you suggest. I’m out of my depth beyond WD 40. Could ask work to fix it but that seems unlikely in the current climate.
1178 2018-01-12 21:27:26 They're trying to reignite a new Cold War with Russia and install a US puppet regime. Putin is dropping the dollar and creating a new oil pipeline to the EU. Grotesque to watch them keep recycling the election interference lie to slap more sanctions on them.

1181 2018-01-12 21:27:18 Yet another reasons why Florida won't be required to allow offshore oil drilling.  Might interrupt the view or taint the beaches for the many Russian mafiosos who are paying big bucks for @realDonaldTrump's Florida luxury condos.
1182 2018-01-12 21:27:08 I’m gonna try to get my oil changed again when i get off
1183 2018-01-12 21:27:04 The #DriftProject runs! Albeit with no boost but it sounds dope! Turbo banjo leaks oil so I'll need to look into that. I think my gearbox leaks too. Happy days anyway.
1184 2018-01-12 21:26:44 2nd time I heard the word Peanut oil today, never knew their was a such thing
1185 2018-01-12 21:26:27 thing is ive got 98% of science behind me, i could pick one of hundreds, your small handful all have odd links to oil magnates, or far right think tanks, which in itself isnt a problem, but it raises questions of impartiality when they all have that same link
1186 2018-01-12 21:26:12 The #1 cause for deforestation is actually plant-based agriculture such as soybean and palm oil farming. Livestock is like #2 so going vegan is not anti-deforestation in any way. In fact, it's pro-deforestation since you're contributing more to the largest cause of it all lol
1187 2018-01-12 21:25:57 Should it really take an hour to do an oil change when there’s no one else here? Uh, no.
1188 2018-01-12 21:25:48 While I was getting an oil change at Walmart the women at the counter looks at me and goes shouldn’t you have your daddy doing this for you. Like oh I’m sorry just because my plate says princess doesn’t mean I am one.

1197 2018-01-12 21:24:31 Not quite accurate. Norway wasn’t successful until they discovered oil off their shores, their people were literally starving before that— which is why we saw a mass immigration of Norwegians to the U.S. in the early 20th century.
1198 2018-01-12 21:24:23 Not to mention state owned oil and a $200k/citizen pension fund from it, and a generous universal healthcare system.

1200 2018-01-12 21:23:58 Anal response to this but maybe need a slightly thicker oil I find if wd40 won’t suffice white grease works a treat
1201 2018-01-12 21:23:50 True. If he had used "poor/dysfunctional " result would be same. He would hate poor ppl, still be racist. Unfortunate but no win /w thse ppl
1202 2018-01-12 21:23:05 We rent out oil and gas rights, so that we are in control and get the revenue. We don't sell them to private companies. The incomes provides free healthcare and education. Equal rights and opportunities for everyone. You can become an M. D even if your parents have low income.
1203 2018-01-12 21:22:56 So true. I've shown our son different places you can find 'rainbows' without rain, eg the reflective road signs, the ground under the glass screen of the bus shelter, the patch of oil on the footpath
1204 2018-01-12 21:22:54 Next week keep an eye on oil stocks a Black Gold run is coming
1205 2018-01-12 21:22:48 I plan on doing everything I can to make sure Lankford goes back to running Baptist summer camps. That where he belongs. Maga get ris of self serving political whorls who are racists owned by big oil
1206 2018-01-12 21:22:44 Too easy, oil leaks gave it away 
1207 2018-01-12 21:22:41 @REI please don't assume members' politics, or we have to unfollow. Come down to Santa Barbara & Ventura, where if wells *don't* extract the oil it bubbles up through natural seeps and pollutes - or burns. We need Responsible Development of resources, with ample safeguards.

1216 2018-01-12 21:21:44 How do you reconcile the environmental policies of trump? Drilling off coastlines? Zinke destructing natural preserves for big oil? Who can be okay with this??? Again I wa raised around republicans I respected but this shit is crazy
1217 2018-01-12 21:21:32 Took the WD 40 to work. Got some very strange looks spraying my work chair. Didn’t work. It squeaks and shells of oil now. Sigh.
1218 2018-01-12 21:21:25 Not saying everyone’s doing it well/successfully dodging snake oil, but I’d be pretty surprised to find a team anymore that doesn’t have any resources at least intended for analytics.
1219 2018-01-12 21:21:25 You definitely sound hurt  It’s ok, you’re not used to having people around you speaking the truth to you. Btw use bio oil for them stretch marks (see I’m actually helpful) I’ll leave you alone now x

1221 2018-01-12 21:21:07 The lights I’m using at TOC were in a showroom for years with oil based haze fluid instead of water based and they literally are sticky on the outside and inside. Your hand sticks to them. It’s the most disgusting thing ever. I will never use oil based haze fluid.

1225 2018-01-12 21:20:41 I am currently writing a piece about policies and I stated we can not negotiate a trade deal to increase Ag output at the expense of oil trade, nor can we build a pipeline without understanding environmental impact. We must find a balance that is sustainable or we will fail.
1226 2018-01-12 21:20:36 "Allegedly". They also have a signed statement from her saying it never happened.
1227 2018-01-12 21:20:35 I thought @TP_PTfitness might find my husky ‘I have a cold’ voice sexy... turns out the stench of Olbas Oil and dry skin hanging off my nose ain’t sexy...

1251 2018-01-12 21:18:04 Yes, a different finish, but if you spray them well with oil spray then bake @ 200c until hot & golden.

1257 2018-01-12 21:17:37 He talked about oil prices in Nigeria and the availability of items. The foundation for this government was flawed from the onset because of issues people like Sanusi and Ngozi raised. We didn't save. People stole billions of dollars.

1272 2018-01-12 21:15:36 yeah you do have to watch the dates. I put fresh ginger and garlic in with mine and a bit of olive oil and roast it in the oven for 40 mins. Then you have a great base for soup or risotto. :)

1275 2018-01-12 21:15:27 "Renewable whale oil instead" Yep One harpoon at the time.:-) I remember having oil lamps as a kid. First washing machine,First TV,cloths lines,inside bathroom. Frost was seen on every door handles and Nail heads. We did not need a stud finder in winter time.Progress was welcome
1276 2018-01-12 21:15:21 Government creates money via state spending. It does not tax to spend, it taxes to control inflation and create demand for the currency. Thatcher was an economic illiterate that created a recession and ballooned public debt in the middle of an oil boom.
1277 2018-01-12 21:15:19 The deal was a joke. Worse than Gang of 8 deal. 
Total deflection here.
1278 2018-01-12 21:15:16 don't forget to oil ya scalp today
1279 2018-01-12 21:15:16 I trust him too...he’s got a lot more to lose than we have We all know from experience that chucking money at it isn’t the solution unless you’re owned by an oil rich country!
1280 2018-01-12 21:15:10 usually I am stingy with the thermostat and indulge on the hot water, but I guess I'll flip that for now since I have plenty of oil already paid for. Who do you use for propane? Walter's for me
1281 2018-01-12 21:14:58 Hahahahaha, honestly I have no idea why oil is $64 either, just trollin around.
1282 2018-01-12 21:14:57 8 inch ham/turkey lettuce tomato provolone salt/pepper oil and vinegar toast it for me
1283 2018-01-12 21:14:48 I mix it with coconut oil as an exfoliate/Scrub
1284 2018-01-12 21:14:48 2 hour long wait for a freakin oil change! But it's all good judge Mathis is on. Let see what kind of ratchetness is going on.
1285 2018-01-12 21:14:40 Shilpa ko bolti h oil kitna rehta h khane me.. khud aaj roti me oil kitna lagaya usne...dirty girl Hina Khan
1286 2018-01-12 21:14:38 It’s funny though everyone acting like trump is the first dude to bang chicks and pay them off. Been going on since Washington only he paid in wampum and lamp oil and had sex with his slaves....nothing to see here
1287 2018-01-12 21:14:25 Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich the biggest Clubs in the world, Man City a small Club with lots of oil money, if you want ure last contract 2 mean something come to the Theatre of Dreams and do something special @Alexis_Sanchez

1289 2018-01-12 21:14:13 My check was shit, l need an oil change, & l have a nail in my tire; happy Friday 
1290 2018-01-12 21:14:04 先輩が自分が使った余りだけど入れてみようって入れてくれたんだけど本当にビックリするくらい効果出てるよ

個体差はあるかもだけどそれから3000キロ走っててOILも3回交換してるけど今の所抜けた事が無いよ
1291 2018-01-12 21:13:57 Cosponsoring the bipartisan New England Coastline Protection to permanently prohibit oil & gas drilling off Maine's coast. Men and women who make their living on the water have enough to worry about w/o a potential oil spill #mepolitics
1292 2018-01-12 21:13:41 The obsession about  Norway, anything to do with oil? The US republicans ignore the progressive policies they have due to equal distribution of wealth, otherwise this figure would be nearer $800 pa.
1293 2018-01-12 21:13:18 that's my fave! that and jojoba oil

1295 2018-01-12 21:13:06 Oil and gas, petrochemical, fine organics all still doing well. Replaced the steel industry. Migrant workers undercutting wages. It’s why we have weekly strikes manned by armed police. It’s not in the guardian so you won’t know
1296 2018-01-12 21:13:06 You are aware that countries such as China are investing in RENEWABLE energy like wind & solar farms. And that is where the FUTURE is with respect to energy? Not sure anyone but oil & gas executives understand your rationale. 
1297 2018-01-12 21:12:43 My oil change
1298 2018-01-12 21:12:28 If you had to decide between letting the US drill your oil, or certain destruction from other nations invading while your citizens starve as you try to get your own oil-generating infrastructure, which would you do?
1299 2018-01-12 21:12:28 APPARENTLY THE WHITE COLLAR MEN TRYING TO MAKE A DEAL HAVE NEVER BEEN AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE OR EVER SAW A MUDDY OIL RIG & HAVE NEVER BEEN ON THE FLOOR OF THE STOCK MARKET. SAD!
1300 2018-01-12 21:12:24 That's caused from oil being unable to escape the pores and getting blocked up. So I'd suggest a thorough cleaning each morning to make sure any oil gets out. Possibly also investigate more porous-surfaced earplugs?
1301 2018-01-12 21:12:14 “Avoid trends and cliches. Don’t try and be up to date and when the sunlight hits the olive oil, don’t hesitate. The night’s so long it hurts. My music at work.” #MyMusicAtWork #Music@Work #ThursdayHipLyrics #ADayLate

1304 2018-01-12 21:11:54 I think this Clyde Mays has brought @BizarroJammy back to life. Hes dormie on Joe thru 15. I got hammered into a pop bottle again. 7 & 6. Ready for some Little Dooey's Q tonight. And a co-cola. (Or oil can as they say in MS)
1305 2018-01-12 21:11:47 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
1306 2018-01-12 21:11:36 As a United fan and your fan I dislike the pic of the snow leopard, they should be in the wild and not in the home of oil rich people in hot as hell Dubai
1307 2018-01-12 21:11:29 I just want to formally apologize to the earth for the giant pools of oil my car has leaked all around campus
1308 2018-01-12 21:11:23 I haven’t had a drink or any sugar* in 11 days and I started using Biossance squalane oil on my face like 4 days ago and my skin looks BRAND NEW.
1309 2018-01-12 21:11:14 Checked my Finances in the morning and saw Crude Oil selling above $63. Fantastic! I hope this forces down the price of US dollar relative to Naira.
1310 2018-01-12 21:11:03 Oil change and stuff like that
1311 2018-01-12 21:11:02 I bet if they found oil in one of these 'shitholes' The White House would send American 'Freedom' straight over to them.
1312 2018-01-12 21:11:01 and i looked up ‘essential oil sample pack’ on amazon and found one that came with 8 different oils and a little packet explaining what they all can do.  i’m probably gonna get the same thing for myself :-)
1313 2018-01-12 21:11:01 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1314 2018-01-12 21:10:48 He is busy preparing NASA for its shut down. We need to bury whatever Environmental Research it is doing. Can't have them mucking things up for the Oil Industry.
1315 2018-01-12 21:10:42 Norway has a population of approx. 5 million, is a top ten oil exporter, one of the top arms exporters and has an approx trillion dollar fund of oil money invested in rapacious capitalism around the world.
1316 2018-01-12 21:10:40 Visit the town. We’ll show you. Come on the day of the weekly strikes over Eastern European companies undercutting national agreed wages as they can under eu procurement law meaning they win work on the petrochemical, fine organics and Oil and gas sites meaning local lads on dole
1317 2018-01-12 21:10:34 If one wanted to pay off the national debt, the taxes from a commodity like oil would be a great way. I am definitely not advocating the expansion of drilling, only seeking to understand the WHY. Just sayin'...

1320 2018-01-12 21:10:02 If Libs want to stop spending $ we don't have & start letting business fly (more oil production, less banking regs, int rates off 0% etc) so we can pay the bills.  I'm good with social programs...

But they don't.  They want to be like them w/out doing what they did to get there.

1323 2018-01-12 21:09:55 Rubbish. Just empty rhetoric from a party that prioritises nuclear, fracking and North Sea oil over renewables and almost destroyed UK solar. And to think Zac was once editor of The Ecologist. How on Earth did that happen?
1324 2018-01-12 21:09:53 oil, who said anything about oil? bitch you cookin?

1328 2018-01-12 21:09:12 I'm a snake oil merchant... there is a difference.

1331 2018-01-12 21:08:37 The republicans seem intent on lining their pockets with big pharma, oil, and gas money while turning a blind eye to your clearly deplorable behavior as president in order to continue lining their pockets. 

The real news is you are a racist. Dreamers suffer because of your deeds
1332 2018-01-12 21:08:29 oh shit! at least you got a half tank right? My oil guy called me up on Wednesday like "hey, I think you probably need a fill-up, am I right?" which saved me a trip to the basement and a phone call...

1335 2018-01-12 21:08:18 Imagine going to city and playing for oil money and a club with no history. Imagine going to the most successful club in English history and being part of the post Fergie resurrection and becoming a legend for the biggest club in the world? The decision is yours Alexis ...

1357 2018-01-12 21:04:45 The higher the price the more lucrative she'll production will be pump more barrels. The rising oil prices will come down. They are just not sustainable

1366 2018-01-12 21:03:35 They only take our oil to help us get rid of it! They are only taking our Fish because it's we don't know what to do with it! What would Scotland do if it was #Indyref2? Such small countries as Scotland couldn't survive! Look at Norway, Malta, Denmark... Complete shitholes
1367 2018-01-12 21:03:21 Since I don't know whether you've been there or not I feel like we are ahead of you & your opinion.

1400 2018-01-12 20:59:36 It was fine. I think it's key to separate the story from the commodity (oil) & the commoditized business (pressure pumping) via a look at value.  Interview makes for a good oppy for those who missed the road show to do some independent study & await consensus buys in a few weeks

1407 2018-01-12 20:58:53 Why is Haiti so poor when it has so much gold and oil?  @HillaryClinton brother was involved in the gold mining in Haiti. Haitians were promised high paying jobs but never got them. Where did the gold go to?
1408 2018-01-12 20:58:49 Santana told me oh it’s for the oil I got and money I use for lunch and all that and I was like hmmm... but that’s a lot of money.  he apparently had the ring on him for a while too because he was scared I would find it since I’m always cleaning  he’s smarter than I thought
1409 2018-01-12 20:58:40 Actually, Norway is mainly rich because we found oil in the North Sea. We were super poor up until then. Poor, but allowed to mind our own business and not exploited, like Haiti and El Salvador. Norway got her liberty in 1905 but was treated well as “colony”.
1410 2018-01-12 20:58:34 Yep!! Really don’t fancy oil washing up on the beach here.
1411 2018-01-12 20:58:13 congratulations!!!! we need some deep dives into this area of neglected area of reporting - we need to whole story, not just the dying gasps of the oil and gas sector!!!!

1414 2018-01-12 20:56:37 Tf you the 1 with the oil money
1415 2018-01-12 20:56:22 no worries, you're still  af
1416 2018-01-12 20:56:11 argan oil!
1417 2018-01-12 20:56:06 They took a big gamble and were sold some snake oil. With all that money you'd think they could react faster than light, but no they are slower than a snail.
1418 2018-01-12 20:55:36 Trump and empathy: oil and water.
1419 2018-01-12 20:55:31 I think Igathe joined Sonko with a view of changing Nairobi but his boss was for the status quo! Water and oil don't mix.
1420 2018-01-12 20:55:25 I’m 34 when shit starts falling apart I’ll consider it. Can’t beat the smell of ridgid oil and the satisfaction of a good days graft. The Mrs however, not such a fan 
1421 2018-01-12 20:55:20 My room smells like oil paint and it’s both amazing and maybe toxic
1422 2018-01-12 20:55:13 Who sees and cares of Kurdistan blockade by Iraq, Iran and Turky. the USA and Europeans do not. I do not know whay did you sell Kurdistan for oil!!!
1423 2018-01-12 20:55:07 @rachaelray watching your show while waiting for an oil change in Walmart reminded me of how much of a crush I had on you when I was younger. Tryna get married after I graduate college?????
1424 2018-01-12 20:55:02 Porn Stars are suddenly credible just bcse they say so? 
1425 2018-01-12 20:54:41 Do you still make that festive burner oil please...I used to buy it 20 years ago from Bath..

1428 2018-01-12 20:54:31 People should know the real and authentic bigot that Dunce Donald is to America. He’s snake oil salesman with no substance.
1429 2018-01-12 20:54:28 My Uber driver told me I had a bright face and that I looked really happy I’m faltered but that’s probably just oil :/
1430 2018-01-12 20:54:26 At Irving Oil, we work hard every day to be good neighbours and members of our community. Unfortunately, this week we had a leak in a pipeline between our refinery and East Saint John Terminal that has impacted many.
1431 2018-01-12 20:53:49 I ask myself daily where would I be without my lavender essential oil
1432 2018-01-12 20:53:48 My favorite essential oil is rose because not only does it have an amazing smell, but it is a very calming oil. It also helps reduce redness and itching of the skin.
1433 2018-01-12 20:53:47 SHE LOVES ME. 
1434 2018-01-12 20:53:43 Today was the day that the last of all the miserable bastards who spent Xmas & New Years on this offshore oil and gas installation in the North Sea went home to their family's. 
We salute you  it could have been worse it could have been me. 
1435 2018-01-12 20:53:34 i didn't think i would care about classical oil paintings. now i can't stop drooling over caravaggio's and klimt's work
1436 2018-01-12 20:53:29 CBD oil has made my body function with so much less pain in the past couple weeks than it has in YEARS, especially during my period... holy moly. It is not cheap, but it works for me and is worth the cost to be able to not lay in bed all day \o/
1437 2018-01-12 20:53:25 I wonder what the Useless State would be like if it wasn't for the oil they steal from poor countries
1438 2018-01-12 20:53:23 Just try a quick sniff of Olbas oil @wildforest_matt 
1439 2018-01-12 20:53:23 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
1440 2018-01-12 20:53:20 And still utd have won double the amount of trophies since you got ya dirty oil money and you've spent about 400 mil more.
1441 2018-01-12 20:52:47 Yes and Strome wasn't going to crawl or walk
1442 2018-01-12 20:52:44 Just go on and tell her to get off of your lawn . . . you know you want to.

1446 2018-01-12 20:51:13 I made turkey burgers with left over turkey mixed with stuffing and an egg to bind. Fry in a little rapeseed oil until cooked through. With the left over veg I make bubble and squeak, mashing all the veg and frying until crisp in a little rapeseed oil. Add gravy to finish.
1447 2018-01-12 20:50:58 I got you stuck off the realness
1448 2018-01-12 20:50:53 So much oil floating around in hidden tankers
1449 2018-01-12 20:50:52 I will turn you over my knee, son.
1450 2018-01-12 20:50:49 Steve how many people have oil companies, coal companies murdered with their pollution?  When will State Legislatures, Congress fine oil companies, coal companies trillions of dollars to recoup Medicaid, Medicare costs - past, future?  IMF Externalities on net
1451 2018-01-12 20:50:25 If you look purely at the communist actions done in vnzla disregarding the overeliance(?) On oil and rampant corruption, there's some validity buried under everything. But it's also such a muddled concept compared to actual Communism that it's hard to see what was valid and works

1454 2018-01-12 20:50:05 I think Donald Trump was fairly right after all .Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, DR Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea & South Sudan teem with Oil, Gold, Diamonds & Tin But have nothing to show . Worse than S..tholes! Greece with no minerals is richer than them all!
1455 2018-01-12 20:50:05 i deadass just waited 2 hours for an oil change. i’m annoyed
1456 2018-01-12 20:49:53 My tweets deny nothing. nationhood is pure business ? pure products? If you are talking of products in such manner, There is oil, it’s tangible and has revenue. in any case, you are right, Nigeria is still a dream, but if you don’t sell your dreams..Trump will make it impossible

Minimal coconut oil
1462 2018-01-12 20:49:11 Should get a pretty vicious reversal in the dollar, gold and oil within a coupla weeks here... my new standard is becoming 4-week options - about a week of waiting for the move to start, and 3 more weeks to catch the meat of the new move
1463 2018-01-12 20:49:02 QUIT DESTROYING OUR BEACHES & WILDLIFE WITH  POLUTING OIL RIGGS!fLORIDA SHOULD NOT BE EXEMpT IF OTHER STATES ARE NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE PROPERTY THERE! SHAME ON YOU!
1464 2018-01-12 20:49:00 It is my contention that at least a quarter of the problem with selling climate change (aside from the obstinate Right who aren't creative enough or too timid to divest from Big Oil) is the small but vocal Chicken Little contingent on the Left.
1465 2018-01-12 20:49:00 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
1466 2018-01-12 20:48:45 Well, where's Mar A Lago? Drumph didn't want to see oil rigs from his crappy golf course.

1468 2018-01-12 20:48:44 @LachlanYT hey @THEmrMEOLA stole oil from your base to make a fabricator instead of just using yours. Fyi.
1469 2018-01-12 20:48:38 Rather than FSG Out could some of these head wobblers please explain who they would like in in their place meaning a name please and not just some random oil rich no mark! #LFC
1470 2018-01-12 20:48:37 oil rigs everywhere EXCEPT Florida .. protecting YOUR property. ..  forgiving penalties from banks because you owe them so much money ... giving your friends huge tax relief at the cost of enslaving #WeThePeople to make up for that tax loss?   #BurnInHellTrump (2/3)
1471 2018-01-12 20:48:26 The oil industry is worth trillions, these guys are funded by Exxon Mobil and the other big boys
1472 2018-01-12 20:47:51 dark angels or coalface from lush. Dark angels is more exfoliating than coalface but both of them have charcoal to help absorb oil
1473 2018-01-12 20:47:49 Yeah it was bad. I also hate fries fried in peanut oil, lol.
1474 2018-01-12 20:47:46 Oil change bout 150

1477 2018-01-12 20:47:40 Would love to see the oil companies refuse to sell to NYC addresses, in accordance with the Mayor's wishes.
1478 2018-01-12 20:47:39 well get to work on oil tanking lol its beating me up right now
1479 2018-01-12 20:47:34 Tablespoon of olive oil should do it babe
1480 2018-01-12 20:47:21 Trump bashing gets more clicks
1481 2018-01-12 20:47:19 You just buy any regular oil diffuser?! I wanted to get one, I had one a year ago and then it broke because I dropped it 
1482 2018-01-12 20:47:15 Corrupt regimes will always keep countries poor or "shitty".  I was working in Venezuela when Chavez took over our oil plant.  Armed guards came in and said bp no longer owned it, the government did.
1483 2018-01-12 20:47:06 Probably the same issue we have here. Oil companies are afraid of the green energy and fight it hard. People are convince the turbines will kill fish, but the fish would swim through or around the damn things
1484 2018-01-12 20:47:04 As is actually being able to put pucks into the net...
1485 2018-01-12 20:46:46 Moisturizing my face with coconut oil was a very bad idea
1486 2018-01-12 20:46:41 Get raw organic coconut oil in him to "feed" his brain of the "perfect fat" it needs ...
1487 2018-01-12 20:46:41 agree.... but won't happen, sadly. I'm resigned to the fact that BC NDP is beholden to special interests in the fossil fuel (and obviously hydro) industries. 

when the market changes and oil and gas demand - like coal - collapses, then there will be change. not before. /1

1489 2018-01-12 20:46:14 I can help with the mice. Peppermint oil on a rag and poke it into wherever they're getting in. The smell drives them away. My mum swears by it - it honestly works. Hope you're ok otherwise.
1490 2018-01-12 20:46:14 Bought TOT for anyone who would listen at $50. Today it is $59.32. Oil via a vertically integrated company turned out to be a great decision. #Sweet16

1494 2018-01-12 20:45:43 Does anyone care that the one state that is exempt from off shore drilling is florida....one of trumps golf courses is in Florida.  He didn't want his guests to see oil floating in the ocean while they golfed
1495 2018-01-12 20:45:39 No off shore drilling on any of our coasts! Big oil must go. Health of the earth before short term greed. There have been too many disasters with oil and bodies of water. If our oceans go, we're in HUGE trouble! Same for wind farms planted in the ocean--terrible idea!
1496 2018-01-12 20:45:27 分かります…その写真のもチーズありのでした

1499 2018-01-12 20:45:04 I saw a video of one being made and it was pretty much a two-person job. Mineral oil is HEAVY.
1500 2018-01-12 20:44:51 Marco do you remember the Hostages deal in Iran ? Iran-irak war?   Why when Obama tamed the Tiger u Team continues to create conflict to continue a perpetual war in the Middle East?   Is Oil that important?
1501 2018-01-12 20:44:47 Ooh yes!! My dog loves to lick coconut oil off my hands too  & when hes being a nut I smear peanut butter on a toy or I'll freeze yogurt and it keeps him busy for a while.
1502 2018-01-12 20:44:46 Yinmu. This no be coconut oil beauty at all. This dope...
1503 2018-01-12 20:44:32 Not only war for oil, but the Military Industrial Complex that is the United States makes waging war big business. Remember how much money Cheney made off of Haliburton (and probably continues to make) from Iraq? Many, many industries are involved in making war happen.

1509 2018-01-12 20:43:43 Stone Energy reports an oil discovery with its Mt Providence exploration well in Mississippi Canyon Block 28. The #004 well encountered about 153' of high quality, primarily oil pay in one Miocene interval with no visible water level. The well was drilled by UDW semi ENSCO 8503…
1510 2018-01-12 20:43:41 @HertrichFamily absolutely has the worst service I’ve ever experienced in my life. Been here for 4 hours getting my oil changed and getting a screw replaced that they broke and decided not to fix last time I was here.  0/10 would never recommend 
1511 2018-01-12 20:43:26 The creamy kind, though, right? Oil and vinegar slaw is blech!
1512 2018-01-12 20:43:22 Oil rich brown areas were not deemed "shit hole" enough.

1549 2018-01-12 20:39:26 Withholding 2B in aid to Pakistan? OK How about Jordan? They bought oil, supplied arms and vehicles to ISIS and support the Muslim Brotherhood. PLUS they murdered American Soldiers #Justice for Jim,Kevin and Matt
1550 2018-01-12 20:39:10 No 70's oil thingy was OPEC oil ban worldwide...RSA was buying  oil all over. 
Reason for RSA withdrawal was US reluctance to PUBLICLY support takeover. Despite US support of the operation.

1552 2018-01-12 20:39:05 After the Jerusalem move? after the oil drilling in the U.S. to lower the prices for his life blood? After supporting Poland? What planet are all of you U.S. liberals on? Putin hated 2017. Isis almost gone, even worse, prices for oil lower still. He wanted the same as you do.
1553 2018-01-12 20:39:02 Anna jus got that nagging feeling JM n MU have gone after Sanchez both guns n then some blazing...we did not spend on a 4th player so we have some in d tank. Thing is it is a biz after all n from d stand point of Oil sheik they r 1 in epl, with a huge point difference
1554 2018-01-12 20:38:59 Stone Age did not end because of unavailability of stones. Oil Age will end very soon even with availability of oil.
1555 2018-01-12 20:38:56 you are a teacher obsessed with survival skills, so you constantly teach books like HATCHET and the like. then you try to demonstrate TO 6TH GRADERS how to start a fire in a parking lot using birch bark and flint/steel. then the fire hits oil? then you lose your goddamned mind.
1556 2018-01-12 20:38:55 No one mentioned the ethics of drilling, we were talking about oil and economics. Norway is the richest country in the world. They have massive investments — outside of fossil fuel industries because they know that’s not a great investment looking ahead.
1557 2018-01-12 20:38:41 IMO I’ve always considered it only fit for wrapping fish  in...., or wiping up spilled oil from the oil change if its lucky.
1558 2018-01-12 20:38:32 BABIES? 
1559 2018-01-12 20:38:08 Who exactly deems an oil “essential”? Is there a governing body? Are oils judged somewhere in Zurich?
1560 2018-01-12 20:38:03 Can those of us that have already made some babies comment on the topic?
1561 2018-01-12 20:37:47 I hate adulting I've been at Honda since 1:30 to get my oil changed and my car has yet to even be seen.
1562 2018-01-12 20:37:35 Realist ishhhh I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
1563 2018-01-12 20:37:31 @UN @CNN @wef @realDonaldTrump The oil industry tried to bully companies in the twin cities to fire people for top management pay to go up. Its also europeans.from the 90's that came in from families in the bankrupt 88 europe.
1564 2018-01-12 20:37:25 It also leaks oil
1565 2018-01-12 20:37:10 Maybe the world should stop trading oil in the worthless dollar, then we would see what country is a shithole mr president
1566 2018-01-12 20:37:09 Everything you said is helpful, btw.  
I think Ryan is aware that it's problematic that the source of the wealth in Norway's (and Alaska's) sovereign wealth fund is oil.
1567 2018-01-12 20:37:07 Where the hairstylist at that take care of and grow your hair? They wash it & oil it allat. None of these lazy bitches
1568 2018-01-12 20:37:07 I use the niacinamide and this, let it completely dry and try using a bit less? 
then I go in with the Granactive Retinoids 2% Emulsion (same brand)
I use hemp seed oil as a moisturizer and tamanu oil on spots
1569 2018-01-12 20:37:00 I got coconut oil in my eye this morning now I’m just mildly crying on the bus
1570 2018-01-12 20:37:00 America causes 9/11? How? And we took no gold or oil from Iraq, though we should have.
1571 2018-01-12 20:36:59 damn  

definitelty going to try your coconut oil method too
1572 2018-01-12 20:36:53 Guys the DOW chart is looking like an f'n penny stock here.  Remember what happened to oil when DWT did that in 2016?  Just saying.  Rubber bands snap and they snap HARD.
1573 2018-01-12 20:36:32 First, oreo argument, then palm oil, then whether or not a vegan should date a meat eater and now condoms...

When will the vegan community stop judging others and just accept that everyone within the community is already doing the best they can?
1574 2018-01-12 20:36:25 Yes face oil! I used to have to much trouble applying decent coverage foundation without it caking but now I slap on some oil a few hours before and it looks wonderful. It was my Bloke who got me into it of all people lol
1575 2018-01-12 20:36:23 They sit on gold mines of oil. When they nationalized the oil industry during high $ oil periods, they blew the $ on other things and didn’t reinvest in refinery infrastructure. Now, they’re unable to extract & refine oil. They’re eating cats & they’re broke
1576 2018-01-12 20:36:18 As a offshore worker this is insulting. We have beautiful beaches in Texas with no oil polution. We have extreme environmental standards and monitored closely. Your car is powered by us and the revenue supports social safety nets. Why do Dems disparage every productive American.
1577 2018-01-12 20:36:14 @TacoBell tell your lazy employees to stop frying taco salad shells in the same oil they use for cinnamon twists. I paid for a specific product (x2) and ended up with 2 cinnamon taco salads that were disgustingly inedible. Just lazy. You wasted my money. Our franchise sucks.
1578 2018-01-12 20:35:58 Ah afghan coats & patula oil.

1583 2018-01-12 20:34:51 America make causes first 9/11 even americana knows that is intern job and evidence exist you can see it and second they don't find only gold and oil in Iraq you must know the facts
1584 2018-01-12 20:34:45 He doesn't want offshore drilling in Florida because god forbid the waters near his precious Mar-a-Lago get polluted with oil he put there
1585 2018-01-12 20:34:40 Does anybody else think that in millions of years from now that we will be turned to oil??

1593 2018-01-12 20:33:51 Just got an oil change earlier and had to come back cause my break light is dead
1594 2018-01-12 20:33:49 Good Donald I like you.  Try to get the word to produce more oil so gas prices goes down and make a law to stop all smog systems on cars included all eco hybrids etc. Back to the sixties and let's burn gas.
1595 2018-01-12 20:33:40 Vitamin E oil helps!! rub some in before you go to bed, it wont happen immediately but in time the scars will fade
1596 2018-01-12 20:33:24 And unless I'm mistaken, Fritos are already vegan (just corn, corn oil and salt), so an adapted version should be quite simple.

1607 2018-01-12 20:31:52 the 9/11 planes were holograms! Man didn’t land on the moon--reptiles did! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

1618 2018-01-12 20:30:45 They tried to take power with a coup. When that failed they used Fidel Castro's handbook and rhetoric to win elections; using oil money to buy votes and allies. They can call themselves whatever they want but in the end they are just a criminal organization.

1622 2018-01-12 20:30:31 Spielberg, albeit has a great mind for conjuring up fantasies. What would Oprah do to slow up the Trump economic expansion? Add more regs and ban oil drilling? Which is our lifeline to the high standard of living. Namely cheap energy.

1628 2018-01-12 20:30:08 I’ll give you an example: in 2016 in italy we were asked a referendum question about oil exploration, 87% voted one way, the turnout was 35%, the quorum was not met = no will of people! In binding referendums, there is a quorum and only one side votes, it establishes ‘will’.

1632 2018-01-12 20:29:41 Why do we need foreign oil when we have thousands of years of oil on & off our own shores that can be had at much lower costs ? Why do we need to import oil from countries that A: Overcharge us & B: Do all they can to hurt the American way of life while insulting & ridiculing us?
1633 2018-01-12 20:29:38 I'll give you a free oil change to bring me some of those cookies to @GeneLattaFord !
1634 2018-01-12 20:29:24 Norwegians are happy being taken care of womb to tomb & how their vast oil wealth is shared among the people rather than just going to corps, so they are all pretty well off with free edu, healthcare, 5 weeks off a year & lots of travel $. As usual trump wants what he can't have.
1635 2018-01-12 20:28:51 Africa has gold. Oil. Minerals. If America gave back everything they took from the shitholes what would the country be left with?

He found something, where it would not pass. They just want to make money on repairs. BAD BUSINESS.  @SamstoneAuto
1657 2018-01-12 20:24:30 I believe your answer will be higher gas taxes to the State so the corrupt politicians have more money to spend on frivolous nonsense. What pct. of drilling accidents have long term effects on the shore line? How would consumers benefit from lower gas prices by using our own oil
1658 2018-01-12 20:24:25 What absorbs all light, and what reflects all light have had enough struggle in humanity, we wasted enough oil to lubricate their wars.

1666 2018-01-12 20:23:08 Wow. Thanks. I really picked up those ideas from PBS oil painter dude. Don't particularly like his subjects, but he does inspire and tells you just to put the color on there. This is how he set up his backgrounds for still life.
1667 2018-01-12 20:23:08 Beställde Salicylic acid, hyaluronic acid och cold pressed rose hip seed oil hoppas de funkar för mig 
1668 2018-01-12 20:23:02 No coastline should be open for offshore drilling. Protect the environment. We don't need oil that bad. We need clean air and clean water.
1669 2018-01-12 20:22:55 Why do Leftists, who are usually environmentalists, think it's fine to drill the hell out of everything for oil, as long as it promotes Socialism? I find that odd.

1676 2018-01-12 20:21:24 And why the drilling off the coast is because the Koch Bros who own most of the oil interest in this country want more money. The billions and billions they have isn't enough they want to make it to trillions

1700 2018-01-12 20:18:39 Yep! Mine had the same ABS/Traction/etc failure as Clarkson's XJR had at the start, until this summer. Now it has an MOT but various other issues including an oil leak. Quality British engineering.
1701 2018-01-12 20:18:37 I’d like to know why the USA and Russia Saudi Arabia and all oil countries are drilling flat out and Canada is sitting on there ass with no pipelines to ship our oil why isn’t the village idiot working on getting our oil to market instead of sitting in these universities

1707 2018-01-12 20:18:00 Do NOT compare trump to any deity.  Trump himself is a snake oil salesmen & its truly sad that some people are so remedial that they can't see it
1708 2018-01-12 20:17:57 City, Pep and their fake oil fans dun have the moral right to call out the Sanchez deal as money fueled. Ur fake club that can’t fill their stadium have paid £1.3b on transfers since 2008.
1709 2018-01-12 20:17:56 Call Senator's & Congressman write to their mail boxes. Foreign Corporations are after oil. No matter what their name all OWNED by same investors.

1712 2018-01-12 20:17:22 I’ve heard quorn cocktail sausages are really good. Hope they don’t contain palm oil.
1713 2018-01-12 20:17:12 I do hope that lasts forever for them - when the oil runs out they are going to need it. Productivity certainly isn't a Norwegian strong suit.
1714 2018-01-12 20:17:11 Logical? What on earth does Argentina have to offer them? Different language; different culture .... poverty? crime? polotical coruption? Falklands have a 380% higher GDP/PP than Argentina (without ANY oil revenue, BTW). By your reasoning; Singapore should "join" with Malaysia.

1718 2018-01-12 20:16:25 I’m just jealous ;) although I did win a 2 week work experience in the oil refinery in cork from one of my projects !!
1719 2018-01-12 20:16:17 Latest @EIAgov report shows crude oil exported from Mexico, Canada finds its way into U.S. refineries, and much of the U.S. crude oil demand is satisfied by its neighbors. The U.S. also exports relatively large volumes of petroleum products to both Canada and Mexico.

1722 2018-01-12 20:16:04 the baking soda in natural deodorant irritates my skin and causes me so much pain. i've been using coconut oil as a deodorant and applying with a cotton ball every morning and it's been magical. no sweat, no smell. magic.
1723 2018-01-12 20:16:00 i feel like the glossy eyeshadow look is prettiest in pictures. as a person with oil prone skin i feel i would just look really greasy, and the texture would drive me nuts.
1724 2018-01-12 20:15:53 And what about Meryl. I am sure she must have dazzled and outshone everybody else yet again.  Do I see another Oscar nomination coming her way. BTW @AzmiShabana is India's Meryl some oil say. Well two legends cannot and shouldn't be compared is what I believe in
1725 2018-01-12 20:15:48 ohh that's why i just look for bujo tags on instagram and don't do the fb groups. i assume they're all full of moms doing those essential oil pyramid schemes

You all are failing the educators in Manatee big time
1727 2018-01-12 20:15:41 Have your state rep's put a $100,000 barrel of oil tax on all oil based products. Pretty soon you will be free. And really poor.

1732 2018-01-12 20:14:45 These people who lost their job yesterday are disappointed that the worst, most arrogant, most boorish, most ignorant, most anti-working class rich guy ever let let them down. We tried 2 tell them he’s a snakes oil conman!
1733 2018-01-12 20:14:42 So if I had carelessly left a bag of 30 marbles lying around, and I came in to find the baby swallowing one, and two remained in the bag, I wouldn’t have to shake her by the ankles or give her castor oil or anything?
1734 2018-01-12 20:14:37 But if entire corn crop failed one year, there would be a famine. US food system built on it, plus soy and wheat. Oil runs the whole show.
1735 2018-01-12 20:14:35 We don’t need more vehicles!  We need solar powered vehicles only. But that would lose you money.....no wall. No oil. No more lies.

1741 2018-01-12 20:13:59 I bought a small bottle of olive oil and  a pack of 250 grams of salt in a supermarket in Singapore. They gave me not 1 but 2 plastic bags. This was not by mistake. Every customer received two bags to create a double layer for their items. #GreenEconomy

1769 2018-01-12 20:11:49 Great to see a CM burning midnight oil to check night shelters, but these services should be subcontracted, government must direct it's energy to address other pressing issues viz safety, security, farmers, education, corruption, medical facilities, etc
1770 2018-01-12 20:11:46 Alcantara is a fancy name and may look nice but at the end of the day it's just a synthetic product (made of oil). I don't quite grasp why this is supposed to be more premium than cloth

1775 2018-01-12 20:10:56 Good question. I am a celiac and would love to know this reliably myself. There are a lot of places with 2 fryers and depending on how busy they are and when they changed the oil last one of the fryers is gluten-free but it’s inconsistent.

1783 2018-01-12 20:09:59 While CPI gained only 2.1%in 2017, 1.7% of that happened in the 2nd half of the year – the largest semi-annual inflation gain since the 1st half of 2011. The notion that inflation is gathering steam is reinforced by the fact that oil prices rose by 31% in the 2nd half of 2017.

1788 2018-01-12 20:09:34 I'm curious how much oil we got out there off the coast of SC. Maybe we should get the department of interior to do the seismic test to see how much we got. I'll design the pipe to run up the Cooper River. We could have tons of jobs in SC if that happens.
1789 2018-01-12 20:09:03 Pep or money?  oh are city not gonna pay him a wage then. Oh have city spent more than us in 2 years. Oh were they a mid table team before oil money. @GuillemBalague give your arse a rest and your mouth a chance.

1804 2018-01-12 20:07:35 You didn’t, the other person did. You said people would be freaking out if the tweet said “oil spill” and they tried to argue back that you’re comparing it to centuries of slavery. Maybe she was referring to the n word but that’s not what u said.

1824 2018-01-12 20:03:51 It’s easy!!! Just turn the stove off when you drop them in the oil and then turn it back on cause va chispiar and the oil catches on fire lol
1825 2018-01-12 20:03:50 Sir, we have institutions that aren't optimally functional, majority of Nigerians travel through terrible road conditions, we've been exporting crude oil for decades yet we can't refine or import fuel, Corruption thrives here. I doubt if any of our politician can rebuke Trump
1826 2018-01-12 20:03:33 With 2.17 milligrams of vitamin E per tablespoon, palm oil is a good source of this essential nutrient. That amount is 14 percent of the 15 milligrams you need to include in your daily diet, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.

1827 2018-01-12 20:03:30 Somalia has the most expensive energy in the world. Ironically, we are one of the richest countries in terms of energy resources (oil, wind, solar, tidal). Until we figure out how to cheaply harness this energy, our nation's development will be stunted.

1829 2018-01-12 20:03:08 The United States used to get their oil from Saudi, why did they stop that? Why would they play more to import it to us? No one is happy with the oil prices this low.

1837 2018-01-12 20:02:06 Smh. Crude oil has taken a sharp turn downward last 2/3 years and its bouncing back to the 60 level for the first time in a while
1838 2018-01-12 20:02:04 Boom
1839 2018-01-12 20:02:00 Amazing how the dumb dumbs ignore Canada. Their oil rigs are up. And aren't the decisions on these rigs made like 20 weeks ago? So one can only imagine how many rigs we're about to see since the dumb dumbs speculated this up to here.
1840 2018-01-12 20:01:50 Also, smell the product. If the oil is going rancid, you should be able to notice; however, strong perfumed items may mask the rancid smell. (Yes, I used to work for a high-end cosmetic company.) 
1841 2018-01-12 20:01:44 I wonder if she knew to use castor oil on her belly to prevent stretch marks.
1842 2018-01-12 20:01:41 its awesome for acne and oil. one time i fell asleep with it on for like 3 hours and wokeup and one of my pimples was completely gone. wouldn't recommend falling asleep with a facemask on, however it wasn't the worst outcome

1849 2018-01-12 20:01:13 I hate when I get my oil changed and they want to tell you everything wrong with your car, if you don’t give me my keys

1852 2018-01-12 20:00:56 Try Cannabis Oil (legal in all states)! If you need pain relief, too, make sure it has some THC in it (legal in certain states). Praying for your complete healing, in Jesus' name!

1854 2018-01-12 20:00:42 In fact Putin was counting on her winning. Let me try to explain the reasons he now hates Trump, same reasons you do. Jerusalem move, oil drilling. N.K. oil sales cracked down on. Building up of the U.S. military. No transgenders in the military. The whole 2017 pretty much.
1855 2018-01-12 20:00:40 "I want an oil diffuser"
1856 2018-01-12 20:00:34 Oil prices are not rising. 50-60 bucks a Barrell. Yes, back in 2010 yes, but now, since we are getting 40% from the US. And only 5% from Nigeria.
1857 2018-01-12 20:00:33 Because Gary, he won't want to play for a club with no history and, with all the oil money they have, less wages. More money, chance to play in a bigger stadium and with an upcoming/developing team, he should choose United.

1865 2018-01-12 19:59:58 Interesting to know the value of crude oil varies so much over 20 miles. A difference of 1 or 2p is expected but 5p is blatant profiteering! It doesn't cost that much to drive it 20 miles further from the refinery!
1866 2018-01-12 19:59:28 no i was talking with my dad bc i wanted to know ways to help me grow and he said if you eat vitamin d and drink a spoonful of fish oil, it will help me grow a little

1883 2018-01-12 19:58:06 Donald Trump’s “shithole” comments may be offensive to some but not to past and present African leaders. Nigeria has been a huge exporter of crude oil for years yet, there have been fuel queues in every state since December till date. Shit hole? Agreed

1901 2018-01-12 19:55:55 My favorite oil right now is Deep Relief! It helps supports my joints so I can keep moving with my spOILed Danes!
1902 2018-01-12 19:55:50 BRT is not entirely bad. Is or it could be good. Except that is an idea that is anachronistic due to the use of tires and diesel in a COP21 era of avoiding exactly those two products of the oil. Bogotá’s BRT is terribly implanted whilst the Mexico is better and Lima’s too.

1931 2018-01-12 19:52:29 It was number four in the world. I didn't claim it to be the highest. They want to "set up shop" because we're the largest economy in the world. Look, I'm not pro trump, I'm not even pro oil, I am simply pro free market.

1934 2018-01-12 19:52:07 @SenWarren stop clutching your pearls about Trump being racist. We knew he was racist. How about you get outraged about PR not having power, Flint not having clean water, #NoDAPL leaking oil into indigenous water supply, Baltimore not heating schools....

1937 2018-01-12 19:51:50 The oil oligarchy’s shills the AKGOP are the 1/3 supporting it, the oil companies themselves avoided bidding the last time is was open. Too expensive, too risky, no oil discovered
1938 2018-01-12 19:51:37 Fisheries disasters?? What is that? Deflection from real issue? Would that be more Oil company negligence that the taxpayers (80% of whom did not vote for your fd up policies) will have to pay for? But keep it away from Mar a Lago right? Very fair Jerks

1944 2018-01-12 19:50:21 Kind of rich for Joe Rogan to roast Oprah for being a gargantuan influencer foisting snake oil on gullible Middle American women via The Secret and Dr. Oz when he's the exact same thing for gullible American males in their 20s
1945 2018-01-12 19:50:19 Yes.  Historically oil price falls were good for the US economy.  They aren't anymore.

2 garlic cloves
1/2 yellow onion
1 celery stalk

2 dl wine

So, a fancy red lentil soup? I guess.

1950 2018-01-12 19:49:38 Oh really? You don't sexualize your moves? You shove lollipops up asses, use your dick to flip people and grab women by the breasts to suplex them. You also rub body oil all over yourself. 

It's offensive to say that the audience is the one sexualizing the context.
1951 2018-01-12 19:49:28 Oil prices settle higher, score fourth weekly rise
1952 2018-01-12 19:49:24 The only industry with comparable power to oil is tobacco and even they aren’t on the same level. The Tesla does make a good argument and something should be done about it but that’s different. You can’t sue over a possibility. Suing for the measurable impact they have done is.
1953 2018-01-12 19:49:20 Dude me too! During the war(s) in the middle East and everyone saying we're running out of oil I was like "fuck, we're back to walking I guess.".
1954 2018-01-12 19:49:19 Take away Norway's oil and what is left? Our healthcare is superior to all socialist healthcare countries. It is more expensive because we are richer. We do have a prison problem, but in large part demographics. That said, I still don't know why we are talking about Norway.

1956 2018-01-12 19:48:57 Wow, the oil painting effect disappears at this low resolution! So this is the trick!
1957 2018-01-12 19:48:56 The sapling recipe should work now and cooking oil wasn't ever meant to be a fuel in the furnace.
1958 2018-01-12 19:48:56 Getting oil changed. I feel most adult-like today.
1959 2018-01-12 19:48:46 Like don’t presume to tell me what kind of oil is essential
1960 2018-01-12 19:48:34 WIN WITH ESSO UNIFLO MOTOR OIL.
1961 2018-01-12 19:48:31 The two,  EEDC and Fashola eat from the same table. Only Divine intervention or another incorruptible govt or if EEDC fails to oil govt officials effectively is the only time dey will go. Or are u telling us Fashola doesnt know South Easterners now buys DARKNESS monthly fee EEDC?
1962 2018-01-12 19:48:28 *China’s December crude oil imports declined 7.4% y/y*. 

*At 7.97 mb/d, China’s crude oil imports were down 0.6 mb/d on the year*. 

*This is due to declining domestic production, robust domestic demand and growing product export due to reduction in OECD product overhang*
1963 2018-01-12 19:48:16 Let's wait and see how sustainable this is. For sure this is a good moment for you and PSG - the 2 clubs to become oil countries play things
1964 2018-01-12 19:48:15 I bet you couldn’t pay for a drink at the bar in Gold at a precious metals conference. Or buy lunch with a barrel of crude at an oil conference.
1965 2018-01-12 19:48:08 Block allotment.
Allow BP&C to determine most effective use.
First, make damn sure ppl in charge REALLY want to end illegal immigration
1966 2018-01-12 19:47:59 Oil change, car wash & vaccum all for $65
1967 2018-01-12 19:47:49 Raw coconut oil is the future 
1968 2018-01-12 19:47:43 Americans are busy sucking our precious metals.. our oil. our A grade fresh produce.. our resources. Our souls.. 
USA exploiting our continent and then labelling us "shithole"..
1969 2018-01-12 19:47:25 Bout to get on this castor oil game.
1970 2018-01-12 19:47:22 What Walmart teaches us is that if we do not do business with China, Walmart and Ikea will do the Canadian-Chinese trade for us. The US will buy our oil and sell to China.
1971 2018-01-12 19:47:19 We as Africans and Haitians have to do so much for our countries so we can prove how great of places we are, because others like China and America aren’t going to do shit except talk mess and establish themselves in our lands for jewels, oil and culture for their own enjoyment
1972 2018-01-12 19:47:10 Therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. Psalm 45:7
1973 2018-01-12 19:47:05 Omg no they’re not fragrances really. The carrier oils (hemp and safflower) smell the most to me. But broccoli oil is supposed to smell AWFUL
1974 2018-01-12 19:46:57 let’s see if I can manage to do the minor  adult task of getting my oil changed
1975 2018-01-12 19:46:45 If history must be taken into account, the @OfficialPDPNig should be honoured for restoring the Country from long devastating years of military rule, making the country so conducive for investment in telecommunication, banking, oil and gas. All major employers today
1976 2018-01-12 19:46:40 A racist sexual molester, a bigot, a draft dodger who thinks the US should’ve stolen Iraq’s oil, a man who’s threatening world peace with just his idiotic tweets.

And you’re his punkawallah apologist. #saynomore
1977 2018-01-12 19:46:19 Americans don't mind "shithole" countries when they are raping them of their natural resources of gold, Diamonds, oil, iron, copper, Etc., we want your resources we just don't want your people. FOH!
1978 2018-01-12 19:46:07 @chefsymon my fiancé is allergic to peanuts.  What other oil did you recommend for deep frying chicken.
1979 2018-01-12 19:46:04 While oil crashes. NG was at an all time high we will never see again. Remember the heating bills? Put on a sweater?
1980 2018-01-12 19:46:02 What kinda garbage is this? @nfl you have a long record of neglecting player health. Why should anyone buy this snake oil you’re selling?
1981 2018-01-12 19:45:55 i just got some coconut oil hair conditioner, it’s vvvv nice
1982 2018-01-12 19:45:50 I work in business development & marketing for a company who supply components into the oil & gas, nuclear and mining industries  (thought I’d advertise it a bit ha)
1983 2018-01-12 19:45:37 My favorite YL oil is motivation! I love the smell! It helps get me going during the day!!
1984 2018-01-12 19:45:36 A while back I read a declassified message from the USSR Ambassador to the US from 1946, and he 100% attributed the plan for Israel to America's desire to have a Western controlled oil port in the middle East. The erasure of other actors is downright historic. :P
1985 2018-01-12 19:45:20 “Our culture” is a misspeak to be charitable.  Since the inception of the printing press, there has always been, and will continue to be outlier snake oil salesmen who key into the lowest common denominator tailor made to gullible sycophants  of the so called culture war.
1986 2018-01-12 19:45:17 Lead by greedy big oil! Ave price increase in USA 17 cents a USA gallon while ours go up nearly same per litre!
1987 2018-01-12 19:45:07 Scrapping 4x4s: Our de-pollution process involves the removal of brake fluids, batteries, anti-freeze and motor oil.
1988 2018-01-12 19:44:57 Oh I forgot to mention black raspberry oil too
1989 2018-01-12 19:44:57 Imagine getting jumped by a gang of Grandmas and hear someone say “bring the Castor Oil”
1990 2018-01-12 19:44:55 Do you use shilling oil? It may not take the pain away but it definitely helps you relax and takes away any nausea 
1991 2018-01-12 19:44:52 When I was younger, I thought manufacturing vehicles will cease because of the supply of oil. That was about a decade ago.
1992 2018-01-12 19:44:36 Baby oil xD
1993 2018-01-12 19:44:35 Nothing is more annoying then going somewhere to get your oil changed and they try to sell you a bunch of random shit like no homie I'm just trying to get an oil change
1994 2018-01-12 19:44:30 He got into water. The new oil...
1995 2018-01-12 19:44:29 Most commercial popcorn butter used in movie theaters is coconut oil based & has no dairy in it at all. When in doubt remember it's ok to ask to read the tub.
1996 2018-01-12 19:44:21 I forgot my dry shampoo in Houston so I used my setting powder to get the oil out of my hair... it werked 
1997 2018-01-12 19:44:17 been walking/excercising since i got home and was about to stop when i smelt the oil amd grease again
oh well time to keep walking
1998 2018-01-12 19:44:04 I’m oil field worker sorry i got to stay true to my roots GOD got me 
1999 2018-01-12 19:44:03 Vitamin E Oil is pretty thick
2000 2018-01-12 19:43:53 It was medical. Some kinda super THC oil in it. Fucked me up lol
2001 2018-01-12 19:43:52 Due to weather, we’re delaying departure for Winter Retreat. Meet at Kroger Gas Station on Oil Well at 8:30 AM. See email for details.
2002 2018-01-12 19:43:15 Currently making a vinaigrette with our medicated olive oil to go with salad for lunch...what would you create with it?  #THC #CBD #FlourishCannabis #Medicated
2003 2018-01-12 19:43:11 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
2004 2018-01-12 19:43:09 Apparently it's a thing to have your tires rotated every time you get your oil changed & that cost $24.99 #whatthefuck 
2005 2018-01-12 19:43:05 Can't have butter, so... no butter for me. Sticking with olive oil
2006 2018-01-12 19:43:00 I'm just saying it's like getting medical advice from the guy at autozone, that's all. every time I want to buy some oil he is recommending I get my prostate checked. at some point you have to say "just tell me about car parts".
2007 2018-01-12 19:42:47 Nah fool you ain’t homeless. You have a home just 1,000 miles away. That oil crack has u stuck in mexas
2008 2018-01-12 19:42:47 Longest oil change of my life...
2009 2018-01-12 19:42:44 Homeland Offshore Services, Nigeria, has 4 patrol vessels for ops in Gulf of Guinea offshore oilfields. This is a private security service to oil companies in Nigeria’s territorial waters. Has MOU with the Nigerian Navy to do deterrence & intervention re piracy. Private CG/navy??
2010 2018-01-12 19:42:42 Yeah, I do coconut oil and butter, coconut for the smoke point, and butter because, well, butter.
2011 2018-01-12 19:42:28 What is this new thing with Norway? They have a lot of oil.
2012 2018-01-12 19:42:26 If you like packaged, poll tested, PC, benign, milquetoast statements that are ultimately meaningless. Honey Hole nations are better how?
2013 2018-01-12 19:42:21 Like she was drilling for oil.... LOL
2014 2018-01-12 19:42:19 Surprised folks are not hitting up oil stocks only a matter of time befire the start running
2015 2018-01-12 19:42:15 Crude not behaving. Do u still see it going lower? Oil retest 65$ high possible?
2016 2018-01-12 19:42:13 Just doubled down on my Gold and Oil shorts with extremely tight stops. Watching 90.70 DXY and 6.44 $/CNY and 111 $/JPY.
2017 2018-01-12 19:42:11 $SSOF Looking tasty. Nice share structure, catalysts by end of month, oil sector heating up
2018 2018-01-12 19:42:07 foreign life cool until you gotta drop that huncho on the oil change.
2019 2018-01-12 19:42:03 My god I really think u need to look at this closer. America literally buys critical materials that can only be found in Africa and countries like Nigeria minerals oil.
2020 2018-01-12 19:41:56 A transformer failed and spilled mineral oil into an underground vault. We had to call in an environmental cleanup crew and clear the vault before lineworkers could continue repairs. They anticipate completing restoration by 1 p.m.
2021 2018-01-12 19:41:54 What happened to Mexico paying for the wall? Your such a good deal maker? Or just a snake oil salesman
2022 2018-01-12 19:41:49 The fastflow range which i normally opt for recommends two top coasts with the satin, and a three coast system with the gloss (1 primer u/c and 2 gloss) and well sanded. I find it's easier and faster to apply than oil,  real time saver despite the extra coat needed.
2023 2018-01-12 19:41:47 There is oil n diamond  in Uruguay plus other minerals!
2024 2018-01-12 19:41:28 Last thing I’d recommend would be checking the oil levels, or maybe coolant, but that depends on the model you’ve got there.
2025 2018-01-12 19:41:27 Had the new @PardonMyTake timed perfectly so it finished as my car was done getting an oil change, might be my biggest achievement for awhile. Thanks @BarstoolBigCat @PFTCommenter @hen_ease for the most entertaining oil change of the year
2026 2018-01-12 19:41:26 The car you told me about that needed just an oil change?
2027 2018-01-12 19:40:49 Who would of thought! In 2017, some had to pay to be told to sell there Bitcoin at $1800, go long USD and short oil at $50. Thankfully I trade price/TA....I'm not smart enough to piece together such macro data points.
2028 2018-01-12 19:40:42 So there are over ripe bananas in the kitchen...

That hair treatment for wash day tomorrow? Yes! 

Recipe: Bee Honey + Bananas (Over ripe) + Castor Oil + Coconut Oil.
2029 2018-01-12 19:40:36 Wow ty I didn’t know watermelon oil existed
2030 2018-01-12 19:40:23 Only a few strain I found worked great for me and those are never in stock.  Lately the “ buds” have been dry or small little bulbs.  Compared to other LPs, Tweed is falling behind.  The one thing I do like about them is their oil tho.
2031 2018-01-12 19:40:22 フラン姐さんに殴られたなう
2032 2018-01-12 19:40:10 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
2033 2018-01-12 19:40:07 Its like this way to make coffee that's supposed to be healthy for you. You put in organic butter and coconut oil. I just like butter so i want to try it
2034 2018-01-12 19:40:05 Bonds going up with oil and sps-- Nice
2035 2018-01-12 19:40:05 Those comparisons are irrelevant. Oil companies have sabotaged renewable energy sources for a long time multiple ways. I don’t think you realize how much political power these companies have. The lawsuit isn’t broad idk where you’re getting that.
2036 2018-01-12 19:40:02 Caster oil
2037 2018-01-12 19:40:02 Extra virgin coconut oil is a natural anti fungal lotion.
Work's on any fungal, bacterial infection.
Please use it. Will fix it in a day or two.
2038 2018-01-12 19:40:00 Oil and water perhaps. But life IS short and good enough is not something to be proud of.
2039 2018-01-12 19:39:58 Professional cleaning. It smells so good in here like Gain and Murphy's wood oil soap. 
2040 2018-01-12 19:39:58 will probably use an extra tablespoon of oil along with letting it get good and hot first.
2041 2018-01-12 19:39:39 I will ask you also:  This seems disingenuous to me, since oil tankers are all over the Delaware bay.  Can you explain to us the difference, or is this just political?
2042 2018-01-12 19:39:35 it's some shit old school hustlers and players use to make their cars smell good. Basically scented oil, but it comes in different aromas with wild names. Shit like "Black Love", "Passion" and of course "Black Coconut." You know how our people have to "pimp" everything out...
2043 2018-01-12 19:39:32 French Girl is a luxe natural skincare brand with beautiful body products. I'm giving away this jasmine body oil & rose sea polish (at Hudson's Bay) To enter follow @davelackie & RT
2044 2018-01-12 19:39:31 ...pots and pans and oil cans...?
2045 2018-01-12 19:39:26 OIL DIFF: 5.72 -> 5.78
2046 2018-01-12 19:39:14 Thank you all for my birthday messages yesterday! It was the first birthday I went through a bottle of Olbas oil before that of champagne but memorable nonetheless
2047 2018-01-12 19:38:51 Jury Duty this morning, getting my oil changed and car checked out this afternoon, ordered new tags for the car, and thinking about a haircut. I am adulting all over the fucking place today.
2048 2018-01-12 19:38:50 @TheRealButchG I need your help with an oil containmemt apparatus that I invented and hold a patent on it.
2049 2018-01-12 19:38:40 That is propaganda, not journalism. To compare shake drilling and oil sands? One requires a multi-billion dollar investment, the other a multi-million. In fact it is rise of shale that is killing oil sands. No rational investor would go in now.
2050 2018-01-12 19:38:37 Ok good. Rn I use safflower oil, rosehip, hemp, watermelon, and cucumber oil. I bought hazelnut and aloe but I haven’t used them yet. If you’re getting any though the first three are a good start
2051 2018-01-12 19:38:26 Are use Neutrogena Oil free stress toner, And I’ve been using ponds Face moisturizer, the color correcting and skin evening one (i’ll take a picture when I get home i’ll take a picture when I get home)
2052 2018-01-12 19:38:22 who knew it took and hour and a half to get your oil changed
2053 2018-01-12 19:38:03 Tea tree oil works wonders
2054 2018-01-12 19:37:58 Sitting in the barbershop & getting oil changes make my patience thin
2055 2018-01-12 19:37:42 They are a able to fund a generous welfare state off the massive loot coming in from North Sea oil and gas. They have a very strict immigration policy. Can you agree we can adopt the same parameters as Norway for US immigration policy, similar drilling policy off our coasts?
2056 2018-01-12 19:37:34 Also PSA: there is an oil tanker on fire in the East China Sea, its been on fire for 6(?) days now. If it explodes and sinks millions of gallons will slowly be released into the ocean. The oil being carried is not like regular oil so if it gets released it...
2057 2018-01-12 19:37:31 *getting donnas oil changed*
“Do you need new wipers too?”
Donna: what are wipers
2058 2018-01-12 19:37:30 Pay them the money you stole. Tell your brother to stop recieving loyalties from the Haitians GOLD & OIL.. That makes you a DEPLORABLE!!
2059 2018-01-12 19:37:26 America had no problem stealing all the worth from these shithole countries..the richness..cultures...inventions..dances..PEOPLE..ideas..oil...gold..hell even the dirt..Ugh
2060 2018-01-12 19:37:26 If you don’t know how to change brakes and oil or just lazy with money to spend...dude charging a pretty good price.

2062 2018-01-12 19:37:15 Idk anything about the other one but bio oil works pretty good.
2063 2018-01-12 19:37:09 Oil for food.  Say no more.
2064 2018-01-12 19:36:54 "I want an oil diffuser" - Tag @JohnnieBowers47 @DwilightF
2065 2018-01-12 19:36:46 Because he's gunning for Bill Nelson's Senate seat, and wants to greenwash his horrible record on the environment. Prior to this, he was totally down with off-shore oil rigs.
2066 2018-01-12 19:36:33 the other night my roommate and I got so drunk that he took a double shot of olive oil how did I forget this
2067 2018-01-12 19:36:32 I use argan oil on my beard and hairline, and it's done wonders both to condition the bristles and combat face dandruff.
2068 2018-01-12 19:36:31 This seems disingenuous to me, since oil tankers are all over the Delaware bay.  Can you explain to us the difference, or is this just political?
2069 2018-01-12 19:36:22 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2070 2018-01-12 19:36:15 2/ Also most people do not realize that the methane from cattle creates far more greenhouse gases than autos. Most people have never really thought about environmental impacts of beef.  Fish and fowl are what I eat. Olive oil for cooking, dressing-plain, sometimes coconut oil.
2071 2018-01-12 19:36:10 You don't even have any information concerning what you are arguing about. There was no oil business, it was a SCAM. He absconded with the money.
2072 2018-01-12 19:36:03 Wen I got white patches I apply olive oil on my face it actually sucks up de oil
2073 2018-01-12 19:35:52 That’s coconut oil in the tea so you’re right af.

2075 2018-01-12 19:35:49 I think it is time for big oil to put sanctions on California and NYC. Stop supplying them fuels. States will go broke since they make so much on fuel taxes.
In the end all the BS going on with cities trying to sue big oil companies is only going to cost small consumers ton of $
2076 2018-01-12 19:35:48 and on Oil, USD...
2077 2018-01-12 19:35:48 Coconut oil, my bitch is loyal
Peanut-butter skin, cinnamon Shiva queen
Exotic empress
My nine platted circle
My virtue is universal after curfew
This is real life, nothing commercial
2078 2018-01-12 19:35:48 Take time to see how oil production was stopped, coal mining stopped, & all other forms of energy sources we have in America that were shipped overseas. Billions spent on overseas energy dependence. US raped of its vast energy resources in that we couldn’t use them.
2079 2018-01-12 19:35:47 I gotta get my damn oil changed
2080 2018-01-12 19:35:43 The outcome is what it is, I found education in your process for oil and dollar , keep up the good work, love realvision
2081 2018-01-12 19:35:38 Oil at 64 bucks... thought that wud help them mightily.
2082 2018-01-12 19:35:28 Yeah that is interesting. Especially when you consider that Standard Oil owner JD Rockefeller was involved in the act being signed.
2083 2018-01-12 19:35:14 My favorite YL essential oil is Joy because it lifts my spirits when I am feeling down.  It smells so wonderful that I wear as perfume every day!
2084 2018-01-12 19:35:14 It’s been cold. Big oil season!
2085 2018-01-12 19:35:12 Attacks calling Hospital racist? 
Not saying it's applicable. Selective standards? 
Pretty horrific.
Defer to blunt talk? Twitter is worse
2086 2018-01-12 19:35:09 They also pool all their oil revenues.
2087 2018-01-12 19:35:09 They'll make some good Crude Oil 
One Day !
2088 2018-01-12 19:35:03 Went to get my oil changed today, now all the ice on my car is defrosted 
2089 2018-01-12 19:35:00 They wasted much more of our time with awkward love scenes and dialogue between Padme and Anakin. Those 2 had the chemistry of oil and water
2090 2018-01-12 19:34:58 These voters believe correctly temperatures globally have already risen and are still rising. They elect leaders who put clean before lowest price, as priced in a market distorted by the failure to internalize the different pollution costs of coal, oil, and gas.
2091 2018-01-12 19:34:53 Hitler was financed by American businessmen who financed German industry as an investment project. Just as Rockefeller sold oil to Japan during the war by supplying via South America.

@KIUTitans  60:68 @CityOilers 

City Oil Are the champions of 2017 season . Yes.... 5 Time champions back to back

Congrats
2093 2018-01-12 19:34:34 I need some CBD oil cause
2094 2018-01-12 19:34:34 But the "shithole countries" are amazing when it's time to steal diamonds, gold, and OIL right?! Oh...
2095 2018-01-12 19:34:10 These CEO's financing dreamers is all good but what about our own native born children ? So sad our own are forgotten. The Ole term! Squeaky wheel gets the oil. Crying Baby gets the bottle.
2096 2018-01-12 19:34:03 Starting talbot tonight and possibly montoya tomorrow ? The oil have gone full tank mode.
2097 2018-01-12 19:34:02 Try cold pressed pure coconut oil
2098 2018-01-12 19:33:58 I like this $SSOF as an oil lotto.... AS is only 500m and lvl2 looks clean. I grabbed a starter here and will DD more over the weekend. 
2099 2018-01-12 19:33:45 PSA: Trumps new tax bill cut out a tax that had oil companies paying an oil spill trust fund. This means that when there are disastrous oil spills, its not the companies that have to pay to clean up their mess, its the tax payers that must pay to clean it up.
2100 2018-01-12 19:33:43 My car is really like another bill for me , but I refuse to get a new one because it's no engine problems all minor shit like tire , rim , break lights , oil change etc shit like that but mannnn I be so close to upgrade 
2101 2018-01-12 19:33:37 Dont Mess With Muslims Because America is Living on the Muslims And Arab Countries due to their oil,gasses exploits
2102 2018-01-12 19:33:20 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. If you have any further questions don't hesitate to get in touch. Ty - Reece 3/3

Some got gold and oil and diamonds - all we got is Dr J.
Televise it, time to recognise it...
2105 2018-01-12 19:32:57 Strange how only three short years ago GERS was the basis for a strong financial case for independence and formed the basis of the white paper. that was, of course, when oil prices were high and expected to rise. Now the arse has dropped out the economy, it's suddenly all bad!
2106 2018-01-12 19:32:42 You forget that Blaire, who was Labour,  helped his friend Bush, with the war in Iraq back in the nineties. All for oil. No government can be held unaccountable for atrocities committed against other nations. Nobody is innocent.
2107 2018-01-12 19:32:34 The point is that we have a child running our country. His piggy bank broke and he just wants to just money. The oil companies leant him some. He’s paying them back. #Trumpdumps #POTUS
2108 2018-01-12 19:32:26 My fav oil is Valor, because its amazing scent and help!

2110 2018-01-12 19:32:17 @bradplumer I recall her arguing (at MIT) 2 decades ago that we needed to go to electric vehicles because you couldn't make the ICE cleaner or more efficient, and we were running out of oil.  (Someone said that in the oil session)
2111 2018-01-12 19:32:10 $SSOF creeping up   oil
2112 2018-01-12 19:31:50 no he just has his two ocsar nominations and stared in films about the boston bombings and the oil rig crisis which didnt pay all that well
2113 2018-01-12 19:31:50 There are a lot of second and third generation Norwegians in the US. They emmigrated to the US when Norway was a rather poor country from 1870-1950. When we found oil (1967) the life here got a lot better. No need for emmigration. Ppl move now due to marriage/studies/job in 
2114 2018-01-12 19:31:45 $SSOF better grab them today next week is when the real move starts 
Oil is what will be moving
2115 2018-01-12 19:31:34 U.S. crude #oil futures settle at $64.30/bbl. $0.50. +0.78%. #CME #NYMEX #CL_G7 #OOTT

2116 2018-01-12 19:31:24 I hate going get my oil changed !
2117 2018-01-12 19:31:11 Citeh can't spend again until the summer after extravagantly splashing out on full backs & ANOTHER goalkeeper. There's only so long they can hide behind dodgy oil sponserships & still making loss. United can spend the money the earn on whatever they want cos make a big profit
2118 2018-01-12 19:30:40 use the following: virgin hair fertilizer, castor and coconut oil. Base your hair twice a week, zizokhula kakuhle zibehealty.
2119 2018-01-12 19:30:37 Ha! I know what you mean. I went on a coconut oil kick for a while and then found out it's not healthy at all. So enjoy kewpie mayo while you can!

2121 2018-01-12 19:30:11 I could use the oil that my face makes to moisturize the rest of my body
2122 2018-01-12 19:29:40 @AlbertaatNoon 4 the mayors: Would u support a nuclear power plant within yr cities if it reduced carbon footprint 4 citizens & locally-based oil production? Assuming 4th Gen safety like thorium/molten salt(it can’t melt down if it is already melted).
2123 2018-01-12 19:29:32 @BuckSexton You may be a S**thole country if 95% of oil revenues end up in your president's Swiss bank, and open sewers line the streets of your capital city
2124 2018-01-12 19:29:32 i think the picture one has gum rather than oil, but these kinda ones
2125 2018-01-12 19:29:30 Its violent but nothing extraordinary. It was a sector lagging behind oil a lot + oil is running hard as well. OIH:$WTIC still on lower range of some longterm standard.
2126 2018-01-12 19:29:28 will there be baby oil involved is what i was just asked to ask you by a friend
2127 2018-01-12 19:29:22 What was the hype about coconut oil? What do you use to moisturize (lather with)?
2128 2018-01-12 19:29:14 I haven’t changed the oil in my car since August and I have to say that I’m impressed that the color hasn’t changed much when I checked it. Now I need new wiper blades and refills.
2129 2018-01-12 19:29:06 Seen the bird that posted it. She's hardly an oil painting herself the tart.
2130 2018-01-12 19:28:50 I have extremely dry skin and I like to put a little jojoba oil under my moisturizer so that my foundation won’t go patchy. But it’s such a mild amount and these instagram muas drench their faces in it. Then photoshop the fuck out of their sliding foundation
2131 2018-01-12 19:28:46 Get a half bottle baby oil an use it on yo girl tonight.
2132 2018-01-12 19:28:41 you really missed a trick there Jim - given you’re trying to replace Rock n Roll - with something like “oil and gold” or ``Emerati gold”. Fun song tho
2133 2018-01-12 19:28:35 Translation: I want to sell your forests and state lands to big oil to destroy the land to line my pockets. #NOPearce4NM
2134 2018-01-12 19:28:33 market couldn't be short enough oil and commodity stuff at $30 and now can't be long enough at $60
2135 2018-01-12 19:28:33 Foals y su Snake Oil en la T4E4 de #PeakyBlinders ... Obra maestra de @NetflixES , por lo que es la serie y por su banda sonora. Me encanta joder !!
2136 2018-01-12 19:28:21 Now playing Oil Of The Lord by Kevin Lemons & Higher Calling!
2137 2018-01-12 19:28:17 Trump is seconds away from screaming about drinking your milkshake and wrestling in oil at this rate
2138 2018-01-12 19:28:13 Lucky for you I smell like motor oil
2139 2018-01-12 19:28:12 We can’t talk about cheap, clean, renewable energy sources that would threaten the Petrodollar system and the multi-billion dollar oil industry! People that do simply disappear! 
2140 2018-01-12 19:28:09 Things I had scheduled for my day off:

Docor appt
OBGYN appt
Oil change
Dentist appt
House maintenance 

All scheduled weeks in advance 
2141 2018-01-12 19:28:05 Boss just bitched me out for the ol 12v leakin oil in the parkin lot at work 
2142 2018-01-12 19:26:59 Your just worried the prices of gas and oil production will lower and your state won't be able to charge as much and it won't be getting as much taxes off it. It's all about the money is it that's all.
2143 2018-01-12 19:26:37 No it doesn't.  Their corrupt leaders can't even get out of their own way.  Why have we been sending them cash and services for over 100 years and yet they can't tap into their vast wealth of natural resources - namely oil and diamonds?
2144 2018-01-12 19:26:35 Great show that was funny about Nate and the CBD oil 
2145 2018-01-12 19:26:32 It's not just fish... miso soup tastes like used engine oil and I can't stomach it. Tofu seems to have a terrible texture..
2146 2018-01-12 19:26:30 Wash with water only soap is a bit harsh on the hair 
Or invest in sulfate free shampoos 
Apply coconut oil / castor oil 
Make a spray bottle with water and the oils
2147 2018-01-12 19:26:25 I've just made the most delicious baba ganoush with mine. Roasted aubergine whizzed up with cumin, paprika, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, parsley, cayenne, and I add a bit of liquid smoke and a drop of pomegranate molasses. Yum. And the cat seems to have enjoyed it too.
2148 2018-01-12 19:26:20 Hope Scott likes gazing out at oil rigs
2149 2018-01-12 19:26:17 I use a small bit of coconut oil mixed with my moisturizer and give it ample time to dry, or blot it if I look too shiny before applying my primer and foundation. Works very well for me.
2150 2018-01-12 19:26:15 @PowerLunch @JackieDeAngelis #Trump's warning this is last time he will issue wavier on #IranNuclearDeal essentially keeps going the upward pressure on #wti/#brent/#oil
2151 2018-01-12 19:26:13 Feelings not hurt. Also you went like 1 for 6 (arguably) “tearing apart” my comments.  Just annoyed as hell. His 31% have become enboldened. You love how he talks...same phenomena that made snake oil salesmen so profitable. Meanwhile he’s fucking you and you ask for more.
2152 2018-01-12 19:26:09 Lavender oil
2153 2018-01-12 19:25:45 Yes you can clean them if you cry. What I do is get my lash brush a little damp and brush them out, while having one finger underneath to support the lashes so your not ripping out the lash...and then I dip the brush in OIL FREE makeup remover and they are good as new.
2154 2018-01-12 19:25:38 Drive thru oil change, even the adults were incompetent
2155 2018-01-12 19:25:33 just heard some horrible auto-tuned bullshit over the top of wu-tang's "tearz" come out of my spotify and i am legitimately pissed off, like seeing someone drawing a smiley face on an oil painting in sharpie
2156 2018-01-12 19:25:28 One thing they'll never stop importing from Scotland is oil, petrol, gas and electricity. 

Without Scotland Wangland stops working.
2157 2018-01-12 19:25:21 We have a silicone microwave popcorn popper - cuts down on oil and faff! Son no 2 uses almost daily #badparenting
2158 2018-01-12 19:25:04 FACT: Oil & gas are dead end investments.

FACT: There are hundreds—if not thousands—of funds that don’t invest in oil & gas companies that outperform those who do.
2159 2018-01-12 19:24:56 my whole house smells like oil so
2160 2018-01-12 19:24:55 I've said this before but it beats repeating. Who are better positioned for the upcoming wave of conversion to EV's than the current auto industry?

Are they that beholden to oil companies that it's less profitable to convert than stay the course?
2161 2018-01-12 19:24:54 I’m thinking there are more than a few nervous shorts in the oil patch names. Good opp there now for some squeezes
2162 2018-01-12 19:24:42 My car is long overdue for an oil change  why do I always do this
2163 2018-01-12 19:24:39 If by something special you mean an oil rich, morally dubious country, consistently pouring previously unseen amounts of money into an unfashionable football team to the point that they become dominant you might be right. They've got good people. Eventually they had to succeed ££
2164 2018-01-12 19:24:38 they actually think being Liberal means being rational reasonable and moderate

when liberalism is just an ideology like anything else that can be pretty radical too, like for instance, mass warfare for oil, mass immigration, etc
2165 2018-01-12 19:24:36 Tried to save a few pennies on heating oil left my provider foe Slomins. Thinking it was a big mistake can’t send maintenance on my heat system until August. Put me on a wait list. Other company sent in a few weeks. Think before you switch.
2166 2018-01-12 19:24:32 i just spilled an entire bottle of the essential oil i ordered the other day and was so excited for i fucking hate myself why don't i just fucking die already
2167 2018-01-12 19:24:11 おやすみ！！！！
2168 2018-01-12 19:24:01 To my oilers fans in Las Vegas represent Oil Country well tomorrow..@EdmontonOilers #letsgooilers
2169 2018-01-12 19:23:50 $GNF.v looks great. Oil and gas junior ready to roll. $CEA.v will be great too one day only a matter of time. Excited to see the price of oil rise and life come back into the sector!
2170 2018-01-12 19:23:36 For my face, I use @Neutrogena Oil Free moisturizer daily whether I’m wearing makeup or not. At night I always remove makeup (if I wore any) and moisturize with coconut oil and a Vitamin E oil stick under my eyes.
2171 2018-01-12 19:23:36 Trying my best not to freak out that I'm still at the auto shop getting my oil changed when I have to leave to be back at work in 20 minutes...I've already been here an hour, hopefully it's done soon!
2172 2018-01-12 19:23:29 He should just retire and go back to singing for Midnight Oil.
2173 2018-01-12 19:23:27 The respect angle went out the window long ago with this president and it is of his own doing.
2174 2018-01-12 19:23:26 Peppermint oil and chocolate peanut butter banana milkshakes could cure anything.
2175 2018-01-12 19:23:18 Then you'll like my next tweet.
2176 2018-01-12 19:23:16 I can’t find the cord to my essential oil diffuser and im actually crying about it how’s your friday going
2177 2018-01-12 19:23:09 布団にサンドされてる時が幸せ
2178 2018-01-12 19:23:01 @AprilDRyan MAGA  isn't a great day in America you are upset, millions are getting raises, stronger border, less illegals, more oil, and draining the swamp.  build the wall
2179 2018-01-12 19:22:56 I think Trump believes Norwegian immigrants can "take" the North Sea oil with them to the US.

2182 2018-01-12 19:22:47 I agree with you. This is not about the people.  It's about their corrupt leaders who care nothing about those very same people.  They can't even manage to tap the vast oil and diamonds they are sitting on.  Yet they have taken millions from us in cash and services.
2183 2018-01-12 19:22:45 Applying oil to your scalp>>>
2184 2018-01-12 19:22:37 茹で上がってしまった。
お布団の海にダイブするぜ
2185 2018-01-12 19:22:33 Älskar att ha håret i en jättetight knut i och ansiktet insmort med göttig face oil. Går runt hemma och ser ut som ett ollon 
2186 2018-01-12 19:22:30 Sauted in olive oil and a sprig of parsley... Yum...
2187 2018-01-12 19:22:22 Then maybe we should stop telling them what to do and installing military bases there. We use counties, so maybe the US is the shithole country. We used to do things for moral reasons now it’s just to steal oil and resources. Know what you speak of.
2188 2018-01-12 19:22:08 I really want to believe you, but I have lost all trust/faith in the administration.  Their environmental policies have been horrible.  They are trying to take away our clean air and would expect them to attack clean oceans next.  Coal and oil are not 21th century answers!

2192 2018-01-12 19:21:47 Looks like the oil drilling is back on along the FL coast.
2193 2018-01-12 19:21:38 Look.. I live 25 minutes from downtown via the skyway.. Have cousins who live on the gold coast.. Attend 20 cubs games a year.. I know Chicago well.. Sell your snake oil elsewhere.
2194 2018-01-12 19:21:35 And “They say” a Blue Whale’s MILK tastes like Fish,Milk of Magnesia and Castor Oil...I wanna know HOW they know THAT...Who the HEAVEN drank Blue Whale MILK to tell us wat it TASTES like? Hmmmm? WHO? Wud YOU?
2195 2018-01-12 19:21:34 Cuomo 
2196 2018-01-12 19:21:33 Oil?
2197 2018-01-12 19:21:30 Gas companies have to purchase oil to refine so if oil goes up gas(~70% oil) prices can also increase. But that's just my crude guess
2198 2018-01-12 19:21:27 Time to take responsibility for your governments actions. Your excuses and pretending they are not excuses don't work. But if you want to compare US oil Industry and jobs booming Alberta not so much, Do you and your government own that or is there another excuse?
2199 2018-01-12 19:21:21 Meanwhile the Chinese are making deals and allies in Africa for oil and minerals. Thx to DT there is no hesitation for African nations to split w US & align w China hurting US Econ & Diplo interests in ways we’ll see over time. Good job S-Head.
2200 2018-01-12 19:21:19 I been using coconut oil I think ,but ion feel like anything happening :( Ima just have to see what castor oil hitting for now
2201 2018-01-12 19:21:10 Why? Stick to fishing.
2202 2018-01-12 19:21:06 5 countries dominate #Africa's upstream oil production. Together they  account 4 85% of the continent's oil production-#Nigeria, #Libya, #Algeria, #Egypt & Angola. -Other oil producing countries- #Gabon, #Congo, #Cameroon, #Tunisia, #Equatorial  Guinea, #Chad, #Sudan #Namibia...
2203 2018-01-12 19:21:05 So it’s day one of me using bio oil to help with the stretch marks coming this preganancy, I’ll be sure to give a before and after result for all you future moms 
2204 2018-01-12 19:20:58 I use @SheaMoisture Hibiscus or @ultabeauty Vanilla body wash. I use coconut oil and any drug store brand after sun lotion with cocoa butter combined for my body lotion. For more moisturizing, I add in shea butter or Citamin E oil.
2205 2018-01-12 19:20:52 It’s a test to see how many of these illegals protest it looks like a lot of them so y are they hear if they like their country so much free shit
2206 2018-01-12 19:20:47 My house is so clean and smells like Murphy’s oil 
2207 2018-01-12 19:20:43 Trying to figure what you'd do with so much oil... Heating?
2208 2018-01-12 19:20:38 Shout out to all the girls that use coconut oil. Y’all the real heroes
2209 2018-01-12 19:20:29 FRIYAY! - Gargling salt water and steaming sinuses with olbus oil. 
2210 2018-01-12 19:20:21 People are hilarious man, check this out lol....I’m sitting at a rather crowded auto shop waiting to get an oil change. A woman walks in with a big ass dog and gets her car checked in. She proceeds to sit down with the dog while she waits....
2211 2018-01-12 19:20:21 F*** off. Venezuela's oil based economy was nothing but a fraud. If the Venezuelans can keep the US and the multinational corporations out of their country, the better off they will be.
2212 2018-01-12 19:20:17 Does the the oil and gas industry invest too much in technology and too little in training and educating its people?
2213 2018-01-12 19:20:16 RT @LS_Nutrition: Drinks marked as "healthy" or "natural" can be packed with sugar and even oil! This January, read labels carefully.

Worse than S..tholes! Greece with no minerals is richer than them all!

2220 2018-01-12 19:19:20 You forget that they already have it all. We need thier oil far more than they need our animals or platinum
2221 2018-01-12 19:19:19 But they rate cheq and oil spinal, uhn??
2222 2018-01-12 19:19:01 @grazedotcom why the need for palm oil in the peanut butter of your protein peanut butter dippers?

2224 2018-01-12 19:18:48 There are 2 components to climate change:  the heat trapping blanket of gases and the heat itself.

Burning coal, oil, or gas -or splitting atoms-
 releases potential energy -heat- that's been fixed in place over eons and adds to the problem.

Using renewables doesn't.

2226 2018-01-12 19:18:41 It will collect dust. Then all that dust will end up in the water. You need another dome to go over to of it to keep it clean. Let's the water flow between the domes. Fry oil gets on everything.

Not far from my place, you have large Norwegian communities (mostly Oil and Gas professionals) in the Houston suburbs. Spare me the drivel about Norwegians not moving to the US.

2232 2018-01-12 19:18:26 I think we had to work on a budget for a few years following the move, and we did not predict the injection of cash that would come from oil $$$ and TV rights.

Where it went wrong for me is 2015/16, where we should have added a marquee player or two, and all we did is buy Cech.

2234 2018-01-12 19:18:25 And our country was built by immigrants.  Why do we assume these immigrants offer less to our whole?
2235 2018-01-12 19:18:25 Almost every time my gf comes home from work she brings me a “surprise” & it’s always a new strain to try or oil. 
2236 2018-01-12 19:18:23 someone bring me olive oil
2237 2018-01-12 19:18:19 Another option is to stop intervening in so many other nations, risking the lives of our soldiers, on behalf of oil companies and other multinational corporations

2239 2018-01-12 19:18:13 Ambia NASA na Raila!
2240 2018-01-12 19:18:11 My man is getting me an oil change and cleaning my car today 
2241 2018-01-12 19:17:59 あらあら…身体冷えてませんか？
2242 2018-01-12 19:17:46 because Norway happens to have Oil to pay all its wealth.
It would be a different story if they had to earn all this wealth in the ordinary competitive branches.
2243 2018-01-12 19:17:35 Over the years they have taken billions in oil, gold, diamonds and other riches to give millions back. A bit like taking a Twix off me and giving back half of one stick or taking my whole goat to give me a leg back. Your naivety is typical for someone who is in need of education
2244 2018-01-12 19:17:32 Ha ha ha ha ha ha! You cannot support Raila and keep sanity at the same time!
2245 2018-01-12 19:17:30 I certainly will guys
Oil city groove 
2246 2018-01-12 19:17:27 気絶ダメ絶対
2247 2018-01-12 19:17:25 Has Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State who represents our country around the world & who as CEO of oil giant Exxon in his former life, did profitable business with countries in Africa, yet condemned the President’s remarks?
2248 2018-01-12 19:17:24 Btw arsenal is a bigger more respectful club then oil rich city founded in 2008 .

2251 2018-01-12 19:17:02 @AlbertaatNoon I would love to know what the Mayors think about NYC's hypocritical law suit against the five big oil companies regarding climate change.  How much fossil fuel related energy would have that City consumed? Uber says 2.7 million vehicles per day

2254 2018-01-12 19:16:50 I'm sure trump will have oil fields and coal mines in all of the national parks if he gets his way.  HELP US.
2255 2018-01-12 19:16:48 I brought this new orchid oil shampoo home from work and I think I'm in love
2256 2018-01-12 19:16:44 Many reasons: to escape persecution, squalid living conditions or for better opportunities for themselves & their families. #1 opportunity is education, which prevents overpopulation & extremism, spreading the American ideals that we take such pride in.
2257 2018-01-12 19:16:34 So does baby oil
2258 2018-01-12 19:16:30 @realDonaldTrump You do know Nigerians are the most educated ethnic group in the U.S right? 70 Of black doctors in the U.S are Nigerian  Nigeria is also the richest oil producing African country, the government just uses the money for themselves. Please educate yourself!!
2259 2018-01-12 19:16:15 Oil leak ha! That looks worse than the plug in my 12 year old lawnmower.......
2260 2018-01-12 19:16:05 ...dictator with cash in offshore accounts and villas in the French riviera. It's part of the dynamic between man and power, as old as time itself. The US is corrupt as hell just not in ways Africans would consider corruption. The unseating of 'foreign dictators' for oil...
2261 2018-01-12 19:16:05 Not welcome in Washington state. Assume exempting Florida from oil drilling protects Mar-a-Lago so he has one place to go.
2262 2018-01-12 19:16:02 I thought they were cooked in heated oil in a over in a muffin tin
2263 2018-01-12 19:15:55 The “Old Engine Oil” porter is a canny drop too
2264 2018-01-12 19:15:54 I want to use rosehip oil in the morning as well as the evening but I live in a place with v hot sun and having oil on my face seems like a bad idea
2265 2018-01-12 19:15:31 Botswana is heaven compared to Djbouti... people LITERALLY shit wherever they want or happen to be, and that's considered normal.
2266 2018-01-12 19:15:17 Okay mr 4 and a half quarts low on oil
2267 2018-01-12 19:15:00 "motorcycle need oil for life, I need you to be happy".
2268 2018-01-12 19:14:54 The main reason why Norway is now one of the richest countries when counting GDP by capita is the discovery of Oil in 1963, and the energy policies that let us retain a large part of that wealth.
2269 2018-01-12 19:14:46 To win Sarah's Narusegawa, Keitaro must eat 21 dimes covered in olive oil
2270 2018-01-12 19:14:40 Trying to START offshore drilling on The East Coast Yet blocked Florida? We need to create long term jobs building Solar panels and Wind turbines that need maintenance. Cleaning up the environment lowering energy Costs and putting THOUSANDS TO WORK AGAIN.Oil industry needs to Go.
2271 2018-01-12 19:14:33 Norway was not a poor country prior to oil; it was an average well-to-do country.
2272 2018-01-12 19:14:26 EUB says preliminary investigation of #Irving Oil #butane leak in east #SaintJohn suggests 5cm-crack in pipe related to recent extreme cold weather, says spokesman David Young
2273 2018-01-12 19:14:26 if Trump waved iran idea, $oil would shoot to the rooooof!
$gold would shoot for the roooooof ---->$jnug would join the fun

not sure about the stock market, my guess is pbly not good = good for $vix--->good for $uvxy
2274 2018-01-12 19:14:23 That's who I immediately thought of as well. Not a terrible looking injury at first glance....until we see the slow-mo replay.
2275 2018-01-12 19:14:21 Professor, when people say "data is the new oil," don't you think it's "automation is the new oil?" Tech has higher ROI because it has less fixed costs. Thoughts?

2290 2018-01-12 19:12:35 Actually Klein saw a couple bust cycles during his time with oil going below 10 a barrel in 98-99. His success wasnt all because of commodity prices.

2305 2018-01-12 19:10:56 Siri found it for me on some random website while I sat in the gas station parking lot, but that's a HUGE omission. All the specs seem to be missing. PSI on the tires, wiper blade size, oil type, etc.
2306 2018-01-12 19:10:26 Photography has taken something from painting. You seldom see art like this anymore, and I think it is specifically the result of he camera. And I say this as both an oil painter and photographer.
2307 2018-01-12 19:10:23 Had my first @urbanmassage today to wind down after exciting/high pressure week & honestly the best thing was my dog's reaction.

2323 2018-01-12 19:08:53 These shithole countries have been raped of natural resources. Africa is rich in oil, diamonds, copper, rubber, coffee and entrepreneurship. Africans are better educated than Americans. Hell, they had student create an electric generator that used urine.
2324 2018-01-12 19:08:52 I add the oil to the pasta when it's boiling, which usually is enough. But if you're ever using a cheese with a pasta, adding butter adds a creamy and acidic component to it. Everything else you listed with it would only make it better. Dont5Get Salt and Pep.

2372 2018-01-12 19:03:14 Are we better than this? With the GOP passing legislation no one but their donors want, Dreamers in limbo, and our environment being handed to oil companies for short term profits, it feels like we’re not better. Not at all.

"In January 2010, BP & its Russian co-shareholders held first joint media briefing to pronounce their tensions gone & TNK-BP.'s prospects bright.

In January 2011, BP & Russia's state oil company, Rosneft, formed a strategic partnership on Arctic development. "

2383 2018-01-12 19:01:53 Costa Rica. No oil, you see.

2389 2018-01-12 19:01:19 when we first practice 
control, some of us realize 
there is only reaction 
that obeys us 
we become titillated 
by this, mesmerized 
as if watching oil slicks 
skim the run of rainwater 
down guttered streets 
we beat down doors 
and say nothing closed 
is an open empty playset
2390 2018-01-12 19:01:11 Not forgetting oil and African people including many many more natural resources. They've been raping this continent from they first discovered it, and haven't stop getting rich from it
2391 2018-01-12 19:01:10 I will agree that some people abuse the system but there are others that the US government has destroyed them. From 2002 to 2007 I had a business driving my own truck across country. From 02 to 05 I made money. I could buy diesel for under $2 a gal. In 2005 Bush let oil loose.
2392 2018-01-12 19:01:07 Oil and water don't mix. This was just waiting to happen. The wonder is it took this long.
2393 2018-01-12 19:01:06 You are just a conman man Like me. If you try to know reality you never think what you thinking now. Usama Bin Ladin and Bush Family were business partners in Exonne Oil. I have same feeling you do for the people gave life on September 11. It’s hard to explain
2394 2018-01-12 19:01:00 @kalebhorton a while back you posted a very cool oil painting of a cowboy on a horse, what was the artist’s name?

2396 2018-01-12 19:00:51 No @JohnBrennan Our founding fathers are digging their way out of their graves right now to give a standing ovation to a president with  s and for what they fought and died for . Maybe yours will drop one day but probably not.
2397 2018-01-12 19:00:47 I am sure i have just said no manager in history of the club has spent more than £150 mill a season.... Yes a season...city have done this 6 out of the last 10 years.

spending since oil money

city £1.3 billion
utd £875 million
but since fergie retired still won more than city
2398 2018-01-12 19:00:43 @olobersyko I once read you short name fast as 'Oil Skyes' but turns out your name is Oliver Sykes

words are so important
2406 2018-01-12 18:59:42 Saudi has oil, so I don't think Pres. Dotard included them in the list.
2407 2018-01-12 18:59:24 Yes, u see the price on a small jar of extra virgin coconut oil? Funny how things change
2408 2018-01-12 18:59:23 Honey Holes.
2409 2018-01-12 18:59:20 Always an excuse, The US oil economy has recovered and is booming. the Canadian, especially Alberta , Industry is stagnant or shrinking. Time for you socialist to quit blaming "somebody else" for the problems you have caused.
2410 2018-01-12 18:59:14 You get more for your money too.  This will last me for about a day and a half, if not more.
Also, no oil or butter (added).  Just shells, alfredo sauce, bacon and toasted panko crumbs and spices.
2411 2018-01-12 18:59:14 The world is gradually turning away from oil. England (let’s be honest that’s same as “Britain”) has had £300 billion of benefit from Scotland’s oil. We’ve had FA. For god’s sake wake up Scotland and get off your knees.
2412 2018-01-12 18:59:14 Full tank of gas, oil changed, and bought two new tires... my wallet and I shed a tear
2413 2018-01-12 18:59:14 So hard to pick just one but I’ll say #Shutran is my favorite because it’s an amazing oil and a great “go-to” for guys! 
2414 2018-01-12 18:58:50 Coconut oil
2415 2018-01-12 18:58:49 I’m so productive I went to get my oil changed I didn’t make my dad do it. Wow grown up life is childish
2416 2018-01-12 18:58:46 Castor oil 
2417 2018-01-12 18:58:45 Its the peanut oil man, its like fast food heroin
2418 2018-01-12 18:58:38 ?
2419 2018-01-12 18:58:37 Perhaps there tired of having their loved ones bombed and murdered for their oil?
2420 2018-01-12 18:58:26 Gold  up  Oil  up  DOW   up  S&P   up  RUT  up  Silver.........up  so >>>>>>>>>cotton, coffee down,  just like they explained for the Series 7     
2421 2018-01-12 18:58:25 When it's yours, it doesn't matter who submitted the application first, who applied first, who saw it first, who called first, or who got there first! The oil can't flow until you get there! What God has for you, is for you!
2422 2018-01-12 18:58:24 He will never ever do any things..
Iran and Israel exchange it Crude Oil ..
2423 2018-01-12 18:58:15 Sitting in Conrad’s for oil change, brakes, etc. cop walks in, we get to talking and he asks me if that’s my Ford Fusion out there. Now I’m thinking in my head this can’t be good...
2424 2018-01-12 18:58:13 Can you pls explain the benefits in the price of eth being high when it is proportional to the price of the gas required to deploy apps. It just doesn't make sense to me. Like no one wins if oil is too high?
2425 2018-01-12 18:58:10 I think the Oil have identified that they can't have both pat and Looch as their 1-2 LW's. One has to go to get quicker. I don't think there's any chance he stays in Edmonton... from a personal perspective I wish he was.
2426 2018-01-12 18:58:02 DUP support hard Brexit & dissolution of Stormont. The SNP support NOTHING the Cons want to do. BTW energy inc oil is reserved. You're really poor at this
2427 2018-01-12 18:57:59 If you have spare money in hand, it is time to invest some in $XLE, an energy ETF. This year the oil price will be special not only for the union of #OPEC and #non OPEC, but for the fight between HK, London, NY for Saudi #Aramco's IPO.
2428 2018-01-12 18:57:38 Exactly my point ! Oil money or the club with 20 league titles...
2429 2018-01-12 18:57:29 @DrewOlsonShow I would like a lesson in being a better human from Elon Musk or learn to be an oil boy for the Hawaiian Tropic Bikini Tour from anyone. Vikings loss this week,simply because Brees is a good dude.

2433 2018-01-12 18:56:53 They may want to ditch palm oil & all the god awful forest & wildlife destruction that goes with it from their products if they ever want my custom again 
2434 2018-01-12 18:56:52 Honey Holes. Sound better?
2435 2018-01-12 18:56:51 Ladies... Clary sage essential oil will change your life!! Cramps just vanish. 
2436 2018-01-12 18:56:38 Not sure if there is a team that suffers more devasting injuries than @TBLightning ...fingers crossed for Victor Hedman.
2437 2018-01-12 18:56:36 " People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get  frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ? #FaithFriday #GiveItYourAll
2438 2018-01-12 18:56:31 tbh, i prefer #OIL to be cheap but it matters not to me if #OIL returns to 2014 prices and people complain about how expensive gassing up their SUVs is.
2439 2018-01-12 18:56:21 We break down naturopathy and we can clearly see that is is nothing but sophistry and snake oil. The more and more you counter people with your fallacious retort, the more it becomes clear that youre covering up a scam.
2440 2018-01-12 18:56:17 My grandma always said to gargle two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and swallow them at the first sign of getting sick…as weird as it sounds it helps!
2441 2018-01-12 18:56:13 The police should investigate this! This is beastly!
2442 2018-01-12 18:56:10 My 1963 Olds Super88 Holiday w v8, 4 bbl carb, and auto trans got like 8 mpg. Couldn’t afford to drive it very far in 70s oil crisis; had to save up for weeks to buy gas
2443 2018-01-12 18:56:02 Too Bad Gold and Oil are not listening
2444 2018-01-12 18:55:59 Texas Oil and Lube? They’ve done that for me and it always warms my heart 
2445 2018-01-12 18:55:49 Thyme is the oil that made me a 100% believer
2446 2018-01-12 18:55:47 When you add oil to water (or water to oil) it appears mixed whilst the addition is in process.
But soon afterwards, the mixture settles, and every eye can see the extent of both the water and the oil.
Election Period = turbulent addition process period.
Mixture now settled. 
2447 2018-01-12 18:55:42 love the calls for $80 and even $100 #OIL this year... 

enjoy paying moar for everything kidz
2448 2018-01-12 18:55:26 Highschool kids: wanna know what adulting is? $405 for 4 tires and an oil change.
2449 2018-01-12 18:55:09 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2450 2018-01-12 18:55:08 Something about oil texture paintings does something to me.
2451 2018-01-12 18:55:07 • Oil dips away from levels last seen in late 2014, but analysts say market supported
• U.S.-based equity funds attract $12 bln of new cash in latest week -Lipper
• U.S. muni bond funds post $1.1 bln in inflows-Lipper
2452 2018-01-12 18:55:05 I hate frying anything with actual oil
Now I‘m dying tbh
2453 2018-01-12 18:54:40 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i let the fuck love laslow is so like.
2454 2018-01-12 18:54:36 I think asking for your favorite oil is cruel because who can pick just one.  But the oneand made me a 100% believer would be thyme oil.  It’s not an oil I use everyday, although I once did for the reason I feel in love with it.  YL can radically change your life if you let it.
2455 2018-01-12 18:54:23 The water sits there
Awaiting a solution
Yet oil does not mix...

2456 2018-01-12 18:54:21 Trump is this Trump is that, but you import fuel when u have crude oil in abundance. Now tell me is that not what happens in a "shit hole"?
2457 2018-01-12 18:54:17 Todays stream has been delayed just a bit.  Seems @creativersegame has taken the servers down for an oil change and tune up.  Will be live shortly after the server's go back up!
2458 2018-01-12 18:54:15 Midnight Oil - Beds Are Burning, is a 10/10 song.
2459 2018-01-12 18:54:11 What is the duration of the largesse??? How long was the $120 per barrel of oil in 2013? When did it became $70 under this regime?  Please let's be factual, your maths do not add up.
2460 2018-01-12 18:54:04 Remember Obama being called a liar at State of Union address? Libs were outraged.
2461 2018-01-12 18:53:54 If it's cast iron and you're using soap, you're destroying the seasoning a little more each time you clean it.  If you have a gas range, put it on the burner on high for a couple of minutes to dry, then wipe a little oil into the surface when it cools.
2462 2018-01-12 18:53:45 Because just like all that shit, its false flags for the US to continue invading african countries to bring us "freedom" . we good though. thanks.  we will keep our oil.
2463 2018-01-12 18:53:42 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
2464 2018-01-12 18:53:33 Virgin olive oil comes from???
2465 2018-01-12 18:53:28 LMAO 1M+ dead in Iraq alone since 2003. Did you really believe that was a mistake about #WMD? It couldn't [possibly been for the benefit of the arms makers and the oil companies? LMAO
2466 2018-01-12 18:53:17 This is why health "insurance" is so expensive.  We don't use home or car insurance for routine repairs and oil changes.
2467 2018-01-12 18:53:14 What’s a nonessential oil
2468 2018-01-12 18:53:05 What the fuck is an essential oil
2469 2018-01-12 18:52:47 I'm going to open up the used one to see what's inside. Oats in a muslin bag (or bag made of toweling) is easy to make and I suppose I could add some coconut oil (it's solid) (I can get some that's cheap from my local corner shop), but I'm not sure how to add the essential oils.
2470 2018-01-12 18:52:27 Oops! Totally messed up the name!!! I MEANT to say @deciem rose hip seed oil! See! I like it so much it makes my brain go nuts! 
2471 2018-01-12 18:52:17 reminds me i need to get some butter, last time i just used extra virgin olive oil
2472 2018-01-12 18:52:06 Any truth to the old rumor that NYC custodians run radiators on high to burn oil so they don’t lose it in the next budget?  Also, I’ve heard heat always on blast to force Ts to open windows to get air in poorly ventilated rooms, starting in era of cholera.
2473 2018-01-12 18:51:56 She never paid the taxes.  She owed about $8500. 272 acres is now full of oil rigs drilling and I am not talking about artificial lifts either.
2474 2018-01-12 18:51:43 Yesterday, I spoke directly to @SecretaryZinke about the Dept. of Interior's Draft Proposed Plan. I have been, and remain opposed to oil drilling off the New Jersey coast. He assured me of continued communication and transparency surrounding this plan. (1.)
2475 2018-01-12 18:51:41 Real classy. Anyone doing that to Obama would have been fired 5 min later.
2476 2018-01-12 18:51:39 Yes you were asked to bathe in coconut oil infused with turmeric, ginger and chili pepper. It's to help with stress and inflammation, and also the aliens requested Satay for lunch. 
2477 2018-01-12 18:51:38 Until Zink the Dink sends in the oil rigs in the peaceful pristine Arctic Refuge
2478 2018-01-12 18:51:25 Or even better, use a peanut butter with no added palm oil.
2479 2018-01-12 18:51:17 Need more oil!
2480 2018-01-12 18:51:15 The land were cows:
are part of the traffic, 
are main cause of the genocidal killing,
shut the mouth of President,
make intellectuals ignorant souls,
take over farm land with vile audacity,
seen more precious than crude oil,
are valued above human lives.
2481 2018-01-12 18:51:09 I know somewhere there's a mixed girl who got her hair covered in coconut oil and her flat iron cranked up to 450°. Ohhh the sizzle.
2482 2018-01-12 18:51:08 Tea tree oil 
2483 2018-01-12 18:50:59 It's a bit like Big Oil. They provided the world with plastic manufacturers and now it's the taxpayer who has to pay for the clean up/recycle, egged on by companies also owned by Big Oil.
Clever bastards,
2484 2018-01-12 18:50:58 it' a accusation carousel. next up maybe emoluments clause or sexual harassment or...
2485 2018-01-12 18:50:40 I have seen too many oil companies pay the back taxes and I have seen the black property owners give away the land for pennies on the dollar and walk away.  One black woman refused to pay taxes because it was cutting into her beauty money.
2486 2018-01-12 18:50:40 Well this isn't a small thing, this is a big deal whether you guys in Moscow know it or not.
2487 2018-01-12 18:50:26 It isn’t, because they have politicians that think for the future. They knew their oil money was short term so they set up their sovereign wealth fund with it and kept really high tax rates. They are now the biggest sovereign fund in the world
2488 2018-01-12 18:50:19 meat and gravy look good, oil ontop not so much, and those weird vegetable things... ew
2489 2018-01-12 18:50:15 Cassava leaves w/ palm oil >>>> jollof rice
2490 2018-01-12 18:50:07 @SenFeinstein I know your plate is full but please fight for marijuana reform in California. We Californians voted yes to legalization. I depend on CBD products to manage my fibromyalgia and don't want to imagine what life would be like without access to my oil. 
Thank you !

and most obviously:
“Fiesta!”
2494 2018-01-12 18:49:31 Yo we did this lol it was the low point of our lives. We had oil heat and it he tank broke my parents didn’t have money to fix it at the time
2495 2018-01-12 18:49:26 I stopped by Wawa this morning for breakfast and picked up an Italian hoagie for lunch. You'll be proud of me; instead of oil or mayo I went with Ranch dressing!
2496 2018-01-12 18:49:25 Markets touch records high again today - "The BSE Sensex was up 89 points to close at 34,592 and the NSE Nifty gained 30 points at 10,681. For the week, the Sensex gained 1.3 percent and Nifty rose 1.15 percent despite Brent crude oil futures hit USD 70 a barrel level."
2497 2018-01-12 18:49:06 Truth be told, Nigeria is indeed a SHITHOLE country. I know this won't still trigger our leaders to act right. We shouldn't be called the "giant of Africa" anymore. Oil producing country with no functioning oil refinery, no stable electricity, terrible law enforcement agencies,..
2498 2018-01-12 18:49:01 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
2499 2018-01-12 18:48:50 always a tough time when activist  jump up and down and refuse to research what they fight for .  more oil is used to ''DIG TRANSPORT , BUILD '' SOLAR WIND BATTS. than New York city lights.  AND they are toxic.  99% led by 1% again .
2500 2018-01-12 18:48:48 ATTENTION GAYS!  DON'T COME TO ME FOR BAKED GOODS!  CAN YOU SAY, "CASTOR OIL"?
2501 2018-01-12 18:48:43 We share one thing in common; both our nations are full of corruption. We are fighting to purge ours. I suggest you do the same; use your oil reserves to create work, build cities & towns, gain wealth & with wealth innovate new technology; services & a future. Capitalism is good.
2502 2018-01-12 18:48:26 IM OUT OF OLIVE OIL
2503 2018-01-12 18:48:20 Computer are dulling this days do they use oil to operate
2504 2018-01-12 18:48:16 My car is due for the works. Oil/filter change, tire rotation, maintenance check $$$$$
2505 2018-01-12 18:48:11 Funny how you fucking Nilotes think they know everything!
2506 2018-01-12 18:48:08 "This is my 1st time coming here for oil change, Tires Rotate Tires and Brake Inspection..  They have good deal..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
2507 2018-01-12 18:48:01 I will drive it till it parks up. Rolling my eyes. 
After giving birth I'd change oil too
Odimma.
2508 2018-01-12 18:47:50 Oil at 89 cents and electricity at 12 cents per Kw/h are basically dead even in terms of BTU purchasing power comparing a modern furnace with electric resistance heating. I wonder if gov will raise taxes on oil once this equation starts to favour oil with a 23% increase?
2509 2018-01-12 18:47:45 Newsflash #TRUMP...Africa is NOT a poor COUNTRY, IT'S A CONTINENT & the wealthiest continent in terms of natural resources. Countries n #Africa contain rich reserves of valuable minerals like coltan, diamonds,gold,bauxite,oil,gas, and timber. #IMPEACHTRUMP
2510 2018-01-12 18:47:34 Someone wanna take my car to get an oil change tm??? Cause car people always try to get me to buy more shit and idk a thing about vehicles 
2511 2018-01-12 18:47:34 I wonder if America will ever realize how people like Donald Trump have connected this world. ANYTIME America involves themselves in another country It's SOMETHING THEY WANT. Middle East...OIL..AFRICA..You name it. AFRICA has an abundance of most Natural Resources & Precious Gems
2512 2018-01-12 18:47:31 And the call from Zinke comes, there will be oil wells off Florida, we decided we can't play favorites.
2513 2018-01-12 18:47:25 Where is #HarveyYates the best thing that has happened to @NewMexicoGOP? Is he recruiting Republicans?

Will the deep-pocket oil tycoon be investing n supporting @NMDEMS candidates again?#nmpol #nmlegis
2514 2018-01-12 18:47:08 "I had an oil change done and it was a pleasant experience.  Nelson the owner is very friendly and helpful and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
2515 2018-01-12 18:46:59 #Africa demands $200 trillion from #US 4 #slavery  & plundering natural resources from #coltan to #oil
2516 2018-01-12 18:46:58 Yes Ali!

Oil thigh na Banrighinn!
2517 2018-01-12 18:46:58 Nah, I have just been cooking everything. I'm also avoiding salt and oil, so it's hard to trust a meal service or restaurants in general.
2518 2018-01-12 18:46:39 There's a partially finished oil painting of that but I got all frustrated and just walked away from it haha :)

...For now. *shakefist*
2519 2018-01-12 18:46:36 The coconut oil hair mask I made last night is a life changer 
2520 2018-01-12 18:46:23 Honest not clear unless you are a political correctness dinosaur. Go make some crude oil won't you?
2521 2018-01-12 18:46:16 تسلم يا عصام ربنا يعزك ويسعدك
2522 2018-01-12 18:46:07 @GordonRamsay if I melted coconut oil into hot water and added some herbs, would the coconut oil separate once the potion cooled?
2523 2018-01-12 18:45:49 I would rather have Chapelle as Black Bush for Prez.  tryin to get dat oil!
2524 2018-01-12 18:45:48 What metrics did the wise you use to know that Raila is wiser than Matiang'i? Or it is what Raila told you?
2525 2018-01-12 18:45:47 When the boiler repair man asked if I'd let the oil tank run dry, obviously I lied through my back teeth and said No!
#fibber!  ;-)
2526 2018-01-12 18:45:41 Tough straightforward brutal truth is the thing your condemning. Euphemistic soft language that doesnt offend is what your asking for.
2527 2018-01-12 18:45:39 Si la personne passe par la j'ai eu une méga grosse cicatrice suite à une opération et la bio oil n'a rien fait, et la compo est pas top je me suis faite avoir par le marketing
2528 2018-01-12 18:45:39 why is olive oil so good, but olives are so gross
2529 2018-01-12 18:45:38 You know you’re really adulting when you’re pissed you spent too much money on groceries so now you can’t get an oil change on time lmao
2530 2018-01-12 18:45:30 2/We can have a day Zero tomorrow and Africa will be fine. Companies operate without paying taxes and pay far below the market rate, while taxpayers @home complain about Africa’s need of aid... So we take oil, lithium, gold, diamonds, etc. and give rice beans and “clean”water...
2531 2018-01-12 18:45:22 Wonderful!  Considering our (midwest) climate produces quite a different oil package in many of the varieties, it would be great to have a little more disease resistance built into anything new that's developed, it get really humid over here, ha!  And Thanks~
2532 2018-01-12 18:45:19 The prices are ridiculous now.. but coconut oil is life
2533 2018-01-12 18:45:14 “Hi USA, we have alot of the oil in the world so you can have a discount, we’ll make up for it by overcharging our own country”. - Canada on gas prices
2534 2018-01-12 18:45:13 Started using coconut oil again,for my whole body mainly focusing on my upper body and thighs.i hpe it wrks and tht #pregnancy wont f* me up
2535 2018-01-12 18:45:13 I wasn’t even pregnant the last time I got my oil changed. 
2536 2018-01-12 18:45:11 今日中にbot完成させたかった
2537 2018-01-12 18:45:10 I would imagine so... It's like when you change car engine oil isn't it?!
2538 2018-01-12 18:45:10 ปล่อยมือเค้าไม่ได้หรอก แค่คิด น้ำตาก็มาละ เลยคิดว่าจะสุขจะทุกข์ยังไงก็ยังมีเค้ายุ่ งั้นขอยุ่ด้วยกันแบบนี้แหล่ะ ละครอบครัวเราก็ใหญ่มาก ปัญหามันมียุ่แล้ว ก็คงต้องหันหน้าคุยกัน ค่อยๆปรับความเข้าใจ ยังไงก็เชื่ิอว่า ค รักชนะทุกสิ่ง แต่คงต้องใช้เวลาหน่อย
2539 2018-01-12 18:45:05 Did you boycott time when they weren't playing the oil company ads?
2540 2018-01-12 18:45:03 Ugh 1 boy with Croup and the other with Strep Throat. 
Tea Tree Oil & Shield spray please save me from get either.
2541 2018-01-12 18:44:52 Actually you should start putting black castor oil  mixed with coconut oil where your brows should be, that’s what I did when my brows wouldn’t grow and look at them bitches now
2542 2018-01-12 18:44:41 I don't know, Nunca.  They get to keep their shoreline free of oil spills.  I hope, however, that there will never be a Trump Republican elected anywhere.
2543 2018-01-12 18:44:38 me: im not gonna spend any more money
also me: just spent £50 on hair straighteners, tea tree oil and a himalayan salt lamp
2544 2018-01-12 18:44:38 I think it's about a lot more than the price of oil. The product is going to be moved to market and moving it by truck or train puts more environmentally sensitive areas at risk than by pipeline. Its just common sense, especially through the mountains.
2545 2018-01-12 18:44:37 こんな時間に。。。。
2546 2018-01-12 18:44:32 ...neatly absolving Western countries and their corporations of blame. "Hey, we're just taking the oil and the minerals and shit! We paid for it, it's all good!"
2547 2018-01-12 18:44:23 That wild hair growth oil really do be  working 
2548 2018-01-12 18:44:00 Peppermint oil can really help with nausea
2549 2018-01-12 18:43:58 I was checking my oil while my car pumped gas. Got a lot of looks. Lol this is what you’re supposed to do.
2550 2018-01-12 18:43:56 مع الأهلي لايمكن تغمض عينيك 
2551 2018-01-12 18:43:46 Guys I’m so shook coconut oil is really helping my skin
2552 2018-01-12 18:43:35 There's no oil leaking onto the road! Is this a real Royal Enfield or a modern one built in India?
2553 2018-01-12 18:43:25 GLAMOUR: Sometimes use a massage oil.
2554 2018-01-12 18:43:07 Damn, I hope it has Hot Oil Ramparts. The Screwy London Mayor needs to be escorted in and out of this Embassy
2555 2018-01-12 18:42:57 Neymar moved to #Psg because of oil money.... But not to play foothbal.... You are out and the world of football will forget him no matter how he plays.... Psg is a huge step back in his carrier.... It better to move to China where you may be the Asian best but for get Europe
2556 2018-01-12 18:42:55 Thank god for oil blotting sheets fr
2557 2018-01-12 18:42:47 New York City is suing 5 of the largest oil cos over billions of dollars it spends protecting the city from the effects of climate change, and it plans to divest its pension funds' $5 billion in assets involving fossil fuel producers, Mayor de Blasio announced Wednesday.
2558 2018-01-12 18:42:04 Anchovies. Which i think is wrong because my Nonna and Nonno made their own pesto in Liguria and i never saw any fish.
Just basil, oil and nuts. 
Lovely!!!!
2559 2018-01-12 18:41:47 As an OAP I would prefer really low oil prices !!
2560 2018-01-12 18:41:42 They are not mutually exclusive concepts.
2561 2018-01-12 18:41:42 Have you tried it with coconut oil? 
2562 2018-01-12 18:41:10 Also a country with almost no people, all funded by oil reserves and completely protected by the US military. All this things listed are available because of America and the American taxpayer. Your welcome Norway.
2563 2018-01-12 18:40:56 You been living in a cave?
2564 2018-01-12 18:40:53 Ooooowee I need Mineral Oil and Cranberry Juice!! ASAP man or man, one reason why I like to disinfect and wipe down..

2565 2018-01-12 18:40:50 Message on the car dashboard: “Oil pressure too low. Engine may be damaged. Turn off the engine. It is not possible to continue your journey.” 

What did I do? Carried on driving of course. I’m not having a car tell me what to do
2566 2018-01-12 18:40:49 I'll oil you're tits anytime xxxxxxxxxxx
2567 2018-01-12 18:40:25 Text message from Mummy Heasy:  "No house parties!"

As IF I would do that.  I do plan to get @drdunky over in his catwoman outfit later on.  It's like looking at a Persian dipped in oil...
2568 2018-01-12 18:40:22 Siang tadi banyak sgt tido

Tapi menguji betul bila sesejuk ni lapar lah pulaaakkk

2570 2018-01-12 18:40:12 When the oil men go at city so will the money, if the glazers go Utd will have more money to spend 
2571 2018-01-12 18:40:12 since when did buying Coconut Oil in Target turn dirty? I feel like I was being judged for the unusually large container of Coconut Oil in my basket.. I could be using for cooking you know .. I mean I'm not, but I could be...
2572 2018-01-12 18:40:09 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
2573 2018-01-12 18:40:04 People pray for cake. But when God gives them eggs, butter, oil, batter, a pan and an oven, they get mad and leave the kitchen
2574 2018-01-12 18:39:59 They own both parties too, this has been going on since vietnam over oil and heroin.
2575 2018-01-12 18:39:59 OIL DIFF: 5.65 -> 5.7
2576 2018-01-12 18:39:53 I’m in the middle of changing my oil and I just noticed I was missing the pliers 
2577 2018-01-12 18:39:34 I needa get an oil change and i gotta go to a meeting at 3 
2578 2018-01-12 18:39:31 Amazing how so many feel that way...I have noticed that oil and gas has not gone up as expected and this mornings news indicated that there will be or has been a drop in some grocery items.  
2579 2018-01-12 18:39:17 مبروووك للاهلاويه كلهم
2580 2018-01-12 18:39:03 Christ you spelt Eisel wrong Big Tex! Go choke on some oil
2581 2018-01-12 18:38:57 Canada has tax rates as high as 50%. Sweden 50%. Norway shares oil revenues. Are you will to pay 1/2 you salary to the government? They don’t have a good management track record. Who do you think actually pays employer taxes?
2582 2018-01-12 18:38:52 Watching Jamie Oliver and I'm starting to think he has shares in an olive oil company! He covers everything in a "drizzle" of the stuff 
2583 2018-01-12 18:38:47 The latter seems to be a prerequisite to be the former.
2584 2018-01-12 18:38:32 You still didn't address the literally BILLIONS of people doomed to perish due to their bad real estate situation. More plot holes in that Bible than a standard slab of Swiss cheese.youve been brainwashed.  It's remarkable that it's 2018 and people are still buying snake oil.
2585 2018-01-12 18:38:31 correction... of prices and a return of the oil market to balance, i.e. return of OECD stock levels to their 5-year avg.
2586 2018-01-12 18:38:23 Seeing so many pictures of costal WA today, and a lot of them with pictures of dogs.

It’d be more awesome if it wasn’t because we’re afraid of losing our beautiful coasts to bullshit oil.
2587 2018-01-12 18:38:05 Too much oil in Iraq for it to be referred to as a shithole. I am not convinced he meant this as racist as much as he meant this about what these countries can do for him.
2588 2018-01-12 18:38:02 Boone Pickens shutting down. Say he predicts oil going to below$20
2589 2018-01-12 18:37:59 I remember when coconut oil was a disgrace now it's one of the most expensive oils on the shelf!!!
2590 2018-01-12 18:37:32 Is the proof Trudeau is helping Canada that he has tax payers paying for multiple nannies 2 raise his kids for him? Is it his refusal 2 supply eastern Canadian refineries with oil mined in Canada instead of middle east countries with awful human rights records. Help me understand
2591 2018-01-12 18:37:31 ميهمش أن شاء الله فايزين
2592 2018-01-12 18:37:03 The US gives Haiti 300 million, El Salvador 52 million. Can someone explain to me why these tiny countries receiving all of this aid are such shitholes?Bc of the corrupt governments.Not to mention how rich these countries are in gold, oil, and other natural resources. MSM silent
2593 2018-01-12 18:36:39 Money .. small word to describe the biggest club on the planet .. small enough to describe City because with out oil money that’s what they are .. SMALL
2594 2018-01-12 18:36:36 What's unfortunate is dems seizing on the smallest things to undermine any effort to help American Citizens and country
2595 2018-01-12 18:36:32 You'd be fucked without oil
2596 2018-01-12 18:36:17 Good 1-A @NPR this morning on the Trump comments and how they will change geopolitics and not for the best for the USA. China will step in to the void trump is leaving. Nigeria doesn't have a lot of huts...but it has a good deal of oil. Oil is wealth/stability. Not genius acts.
2597 2018-01-12 18:36:04 Lmao my car ran out of oil and I’m stuck at a gas station and it doesn’t have the oil I need hahah
2598 2018-01-12 18:35:55 With cryptos and mj tickers bleeding oil stocks might are sure to surge this Q1. Many oil producers will be profitable this year and if you have been to the pump lately you know gas prices are steadily rising
2599 2018-01-12 18:35:53 
2600 2018-01-12 18:35:40 I tried taking omega 3 pills with salmon oil.  I was burping what tasted like spoiled salmon for the rest of the day.  I thought I was going to die.
2601 2018-01-12 18:35:40 Jimmy was the best president of my lifetime. He was unfairly denigrated & sabotaged by corrupt DC, corporate media, big oil & the military industrial complex.
2602 2018-01-12 18:35:32 I feel like if you were writing a short story and you named the Texas oil magnate character T Boone Pickens people would think it was a bit on the nose. Yet this is a real dude.
2603 2018-01-12 18:35:23 Get well soon! Ever try diffusing essential oil? Like eucalyptus- helped my bad cold. But careful around small animals (cats birds) can be toxic.
2604 2018-01-12 18:35:19 Courtwarming TONIGHT vs Paris - HS gym - 4 gms beginning at 4:30 with JVG, JVB, VG, VB; Great time to buy MFA Oil Shootout Tix for next Saturday's game...Tix are $8 or $10 at the door.
2605 2018-01-12 18:35:18 I remember how irritated I got at some co-workers, though. x.x

How hard is it to take a minute to filter the dang oil ya filthy slacking ingrates?

2609 2018-01-12 18:34:58 Neither Scotland or the UK (nor of course Aberdeen) has anything approaching the oil based Sovereign fund that Norway so prudently garnered & invested for future generations. In the UK it's all gone.
2610 2018-01-12 18:34:41 Not me pal. I'm not your ordinary progressive. One day, when big oil has totally destroyed the ecosystem, and we're all choking on industrial waste, and the uber rich have created one big monopoly to which we all owe our souls, you will wish you had listened.
2611 2018-01-12 18:34:35 Thank you!!  Why didn't I think of that  I have like 3 things of coconut oil laying around lol

2614 2018-01-12 18:34:22 Hi Ellen, this is really bad, I have stay at the hotel in Santa Barabara and when we walked on the beach our feet were covered in black oil. We need to stop messing up our earth. People the earth is our home.
2615 2018-01-12 18:34:19 Indeed. Govs are also liable. But the oil companies are more sinister and actually contributed to govs n politicians being unaware of the serious consequences of global warming till more recently. And so they shld be made accountable.
2616 2018-01-12 18:34:15 Trump will extend waiver  for Iran oil export sanctions in nuclear deal “for the last time”: senior administration official. Gives Congress, EU allies til April to “fix” deal
2617 2018-01-12 18:34:03 the man who
owns all the oil,
forces Chinese children to make smartphones
and doesn’t give a fuck about Palestine.
2618 2018-01-12 18:33:56 Ya with freeze offs slowly winding down and prices still up this high, rigs going to keep moving higher.  Should see 1,000 oil rigs by Aug
2619 2018-01-12 18:33:46 This oil ya re kgawata. When the rand is good oil ya tura, when oil is cheap the rand is weak. Ai.
2620 2018-01-12 18:33:41 While Us oil is booming, Canadian economy is lagging behind under carbon taxes. But this guy is on townhall tour deflecting from real economic issues. #nafta is done and interest rates are rising, jobs are stagnant.
2621 2018-01-12 18:33:24 Just stay yo ass at home until tomorrow and take that car somewhere to get the oil changed!!!
2622 2018-01-12 18:33:09 seize all syria country assets please in oil, water, & raw materials!!! banks currency regatory system is to be shut down now please!!!! syria is &emeny of US, hillary clinton has confirm, with al gore the real al gore!! not welwood that are fake in palm spirngs in downtown!!

2624 2018-01-12 18:32:56 Here comes the oil scare.
2625 2018-01-12 18:32:40 ok real talk avocado oil is the shit and I can get a giant bottle of it for $10

dat high smoke point 
2626 2018-01-12 18:32:39 You are talented! Have you tried coconut oil to remove the charcoal?
2627 2018-01-12 18:32:27 So, If I'm not supposed to trust a Snake Oil salesman, why would I trust an Emu Oil salesman? These are pertinent questions...
2628 2018-01-12 18:32:26 If not I'm pretty sure he could be a good snake oil salesman to Florida
2629 2018-01-12 18:32:23 I linked to this part in particular as it is the core of it.
Consider as you read that Gaddafi, Hussein and Assad all refused to comply.
Libya had the Gold Dinar. Hussein wanted Euros and Syria's central bank does not kowtow to the IMF. It was never about the actual oil.
2630 2018-01-12 18:32:23 My homegirl called me asking how to check her oil, I'm like bihhhh u ain't going no where today, you not experienced enough to be driving in this snow
2631 2018-01-12 18:32:16 I’m sitting here getting my oil changed, and I can’t help but think of the number of mice that wait for these people to drop popcorn on the floor. 
2632 2018-01-12 18:32:15 Stay away from
Trouble-maken 
Sh*t Stirer. 
Someone who adds fire to oil during peace time to create trouble.
2633 2018-01-12 18:31:41 It's definitely a creation of that environment. There's a special focus on the notion of natural resources extraction (oil) under the control of US miltinationals. Firn's contribution to the Red Paper precedes it in the core/periphery focus too.

2637 2018-01-12 18:31:30 And by Monday they'll be back to the "Trump is a Russian spy" narrative.  Yawn.
2638 2018-01-12 18:31:28 I have had 4 migraines this week and all I can say is PEPPERMINT OIL IS A LIFESAVER 
2639 2018-01-12 18:31:22 There are no wars dumbass, except the wars US is creating for oil, dollar and control. And guess who is responsible for that mess now. We live in 2018. Time for you to do some updating instead of playing golf.
2640 2018-01-12 18:31:11 When you overlap the splatter of Tugnutt OTT mask with Cujo's oil drop mask, it opens a gate to hell
2641 2018-01-12 18:31:00 I make a Jamie Oliver inspired pasta bake with any leftover veg. Roast with olive oil and garlic and add some tinned tomatoes and grated cheese. It's so tasty too! Plus you can freeze potions for later 
2642 2018-01-12 18:30:54 Their economy is dependent on their oil. The folks here who want to be like Norway, generally frown when we discuss tapping into natural resources.
2643 2018-01-12 18:30:53 Hey!  Anyone using hemp or CBD oil?  If you don't want to admit it publicly hit me with a PM.  I'm curious how it's working for you 
2644 2018-01-12 18:30:41 Trying this castor oil shit for my lashes. I hope this works 
2645 2018-01-12 18:30:39 Right again my friend! I find myself liking your views more and more. Subisidizing a host of things are a way to accelerate growth and cooperation.

Something else Nigeria can do to foster development; use our oil money to subsidize anything and everything any Nigerian does!
2646 2018-01-12 18:30:33 Coconut oil and a snapchat filter 
2647 2018-01-12 18:30:30 an "oil port"? Did you look at those numbers? The Port of Vancouver is expanding to to add another 10,000 or so ship movements a year. Oil would represent between 2% and 4% of ship movements. Not exactly an "oil port"
2648 2018-01-12 18:30:26 I'm literally at the point of: maybe if we just put oil into a capsule for her to swallow
2649 2018-01-12 18:30:20 Baker Hughes rig count -Jan 12 - For the U.S. count, rigs classified as drilling for oil are up 10 at 752 and gas rigs are up 5 at 187.
2650 2018-01-12 18:30:19 @SecretaryZinke If Diane Feinstein & other anti-oil  States don't want anything to do with drilling & oil - is there a way to ban any oil usage / movement within  these states in any form ?. Let them be devoid on any oil & see if their economy survives.
2651 2018-01-12 18:30:15 The main thing I came to Walmart for was dog food. Now I’ve checked out & bought EVERYTHING else but guess what I forgot? Dog food thankfully they’re still changing my oil & I hadn’t left yet
2652 2018-01-12 18:30:00 do you want $10/ gallon gas prices?  I know I don't...unfortunately we can't fill our gas tanks solely with gas we produce ourselves...does that mean we should topple government's who control the land where oil is?
2653 2018-01-12 18:29:55 we ask all per admiral kirby vice president of USA to seize all syria assets in oil, raw materials with banks, ass terrorists cell in palm springs confirm with man walking like idiot!!! thats bitch boy after all with abc news force!!!
2654 2018-01-12 18:29:46 Sadly, there's a portion of that 59% that disapproves because they are disappointed that Trump hasn't built a wall, kicked out brown people, eliminated the EPA, sold off all public lands to oil companies, and burned down the guv'ment.
2655 2018-01-12 18:29:39 Venezuela is a shithole I’m sorry to say and went downhill after Chavez did exactly what I said...their oil fields and industry is crumbling and no foreign investor wants to risk reentering it!
2656 2018-01-12 18:29:34 And then he gets oil poured on him
2657 2018-01-12 18:29:21 Moroccan oil has the best hair masks! AND smell amazing

2659 2018-01-12 18:29:16 Not sure peppermint oil will help burn the car.
2660 2018-01-12 18:29:13 I am guessing you don't care that Trump said he'd rather have people from Norway, a country that has more oil than the middle east, come to our country.
People from countries we've been exploiting for centuries want to relocate here. Who would've thought that?
2661 2018-01-12 18:29:04 Coconut Oil I am not going to eat but like to eat coconut in fully or halfway ready to eat state. Being Type2 Diabetic gave up eating it  for Saturated Fat reason. Should I go back eating it? @BBCTrustMe @MRC_Epid #TrustMe @DrMichaelMosley
2662 2018-01-12 18:29:01 “Country Crock is made with plants” VEGETABLE OIL IS NOT A PLANT OMG AMERICA
2663 2018-01-12 18:28:57 Sitting at @Walmart for an oil change. Gal working the counter is from grocery dept giving the tire & lube employee a lunch break. She's giving me a spiel about what my car needs incl. high mileage oil....car has 75k on it & burns none. Sale tactics anywhere you go.
2664 2018-01-12 18:28:41 Getting a free oil change  > 
Shoutout to Toyota
2665 2018-01-12 18:28:30 Good thing the honor didn't require you to vote for your constituents.
Don't think this absolves you of voting to enrich the wealthy and corporations on the backs of the people or your tireless efforts to destroy Alaska for those sweet big oil checks.
2666 2018-01-12 18:28:30 I thought this was an oil painting yo this is beautiful
2667 2018-01-12 18:28:29 Now let’s get some outfrastructure,  useable roads, pollution is less in the city when cars are traveling not idling in stalled traffic.  You are not going to get everyone into bikes. Remember, charging electric cars uses oil and coal to generate it.
2668 2018-01-12 18:28:20 I ain't done clean yet my hair still have oil in it i still have to shave my legs and make up the beds oml and to finish before 4
2669 2018-01-12 18:28:17 "Oh cool, Beds Are Burning by Midnight Oil--I haven't heard this in forever... Wait... Never mind."
-Me, just now, after hearing the intro to Bon Jovi's Livin' on a Prayer
2670 2018-01-12 18:28:16 It requires higher oil and gas prices. Originality doesn't cut it, although the NDP is trying!
2671 2018-01-12 18:28:13 Come on..who doesn't want a Barrel of Oil?
2672 2018-01-12 18:28:11 Me too. I think the NDP can do it as I said. But it's not going to be magical. Revenues need to be up, hence new taxes. We Albertans need to actually pay for the services we desire and not rely on oil booms.
2673 2018-01-12 18:28:09 She Ok'd Gadaffis murder. At the time he tried to sell oil in Libyan Dinnars backed by Gold. Well no one messes with the US cheap gas. So he had a bayonet repeatedly ravaging his Anus. GOD. BLESS. AMERICA.
2674 2018-01-12 18:28:09 Check the past 10 year data. City have spent 600mil more since being taken over by oil magnates
2675 2018-01-12 18:27:57 me putting olive oil on everything:- this is gonna fix everything
2676 2018-01-12 18:27:47 Smog & inspection all done , now for oil change and deep cleaning
2677 2018-01-12 18:27:41 I agree. Its like changing the oil in your car when you know the head gasket is the one that needs to be changed.leak,leak,leak....
2678 2018-01-12 18:27:31 People from the rgv catch so much hell from everywhere
Go to any shipyard, any ranch, any field,  any port, any refinery, any truck stop, any oil and gas well around the country. You'll find an rgv native out there busting ass.
We come from proud hardworking people down here
2679 2018-01-12 18:27:30 EXACTLY, I have been asking NEEL where would he like to see HIGHER PRICES? FOOD? HOUSING? AUTOS? HEALTHCARE? COLLEGE? DISNEY? OIL? STOCKS?  Neel and his FED buddies, need to understand, that thanks to social media, WE KNOW who and what they are up to..............DISHONEST CARTEL
2680 2018-01-12 18:27:27 Someone check their OIL wells.. 1.3B since 2008 you clown how  exactly did City prove their point ?
2681 2018-01-12 18:27:26 You empty them in from The veggies with Oil vegetables It file ups Um up
2682 2018-01-12 18:27:22 Putting words in my mouth is sickly...World-wide oil trading can only be done with the USD, and centralized banking is centralized control of the commodity of money (= govt ownership/control of the means of production).
2683 2018-01-12 18:27:22 They did not become a shithole. The people of Venezuela were lied to and swindled by those who do not understand economic trends and made the sole move to make all oil state owned. 

The people of Venezuela are proud people who love their country. It’s not a shithole. It’s a home
2684 2018-01-12 18:27:03 Wow guys, check out evilcuppycakes Bitcoin lead and link to the coolest platform ever...you can trade crude oil on the barrel!!

2689 2018-01-12 18:26:20 Salmon oil and Emu oil... it's the shit. Can't lie. Salmon internally. Emu externally.
2690 2018-01-12 18:26:16 Hoping the only thing wrong is the lack of transmission oil
2691 2018-01-12 18:25:36 and if you think 4 billion to save the planet is a rip off..... jesus when you discover how much money gets given to oil companies every year.... your gonna freak
2692 2018-01-12 18:25:09 or if he wants to wear the most famous shirt in world football (united no. 7) and go to a proper club not pumped with oil money and be loved by a club who has fans he should come to united
2693 2018-01-12 18:25:08 I think you'll find in Aberdeen there was such a fund but I'm not sure, of course Westminster takes all the revenue from N.Sea oil..then divides it out..and for decades West M has charge Vat on Scottish fire Services..now to be refunded...hopefully
2694 2018-01-12 18:25:05 And one more thing we don't need your oil either. Go sell it to England or whoever in your kingdom.
2695 2018-01-12 18:24:55 My dumb ass went to do oil change... and I was gonna walk home BUT I gave them all of my keys and I forgot my garage clicker inside the truck and I don't know how long it's gonna take sooo I'm stuck at McD's 
2696 2018-01-12 18:24:53 Venezuela became a shithole after it kicked out american engineers and workers turning over its oil industry to less qualified homegrown folk.
2697 2018-01-12 18:24:52 I've been using @MuradSkincare new vitamin oil for 4 days now along with a few other products and my face already looks so good.
2698 2018-01-12 18:24:46 ...guess all that's just scientists getting the forecasts wrong, despite predicting all this would happen
oh and the "expensive alternatives".... no oil/gas/coal are only getting more expensive the rarer they get
wind and solar.... yeah they dont run out, and are getting cheaper
2699 2018-01-12 18:24:46 I spoke with @SecretaryZinke on the phone to discuss the risks associated with offshore oil and gas drilling, and invited him to visit #Delaware to see firsthand what’s at stake for our state, our beach communities, our economy, and our natural resources.
2700 2018-01-12 18:24:45 WHO NEEDS MORE INFORMATION ON 
CBD OIL
2701 2018-01-12 18:24:37 LIKE OIL RISING to the SURFACE of WATER... The true colors and motives  of our president and his policies are on full display. That fact and its  potential impacts are plain to see and can not be ignored...
2702 2018-01-12 18:24:33 This is the first I'm hearing of this "Emu Oil" and the benefits contained therein. You truly DO learn something new everyday.
2703 2018-01-12 18:24:32 Seems strange #USA  ,likes invading killing,destroying,and stealing oil ,gas,from #SHITHOLE Country's,
2704 2018-01-12 18:24:29 I wonder where we are headed now that kindergarten arguments start to be the topics of the day. Like how many aunties do you have..does your neighbour prepare food with cooking oil or cooking fat...smh

2715 2018-01-12 18:23:06 Alternatively, Prez Trump could throw the Iran treaty on the fire, thereby crimping exports and investment in that country. Oil prices rise above $75, flummoxing everyone
2716 2018-01-12 18:22:58 Ohhh we're so excited for you! What about Flower's Barrow luxury bath oil caught your eye? 
2717 2018-01-12 18:22:57 it's one hundred percent a product of an Iraqi invasion in 2003 which created a vacuum of power. That's simply a historical fact. USA created ISIS then and helped spread its propaganda by continuing to ravage the middle east for oil

2734 2018-01-12 18:20:12 "all those fluids"

It's.... one car. Gas was on empty. It's a couple quarts of oil. It'll be fine.

2736 2018-01-12 18:19:50 Koch got out of oil exploration and is in oil byproduct transportation (pipes and refineries). Their Georgia Pacific plant bears looking into. High canver rate around it. They prefer the shadows and send character assassins when people shine lights on them. Shine on!
2737 2018-01-12 18:19:47 Back from #DIY #car #maintenance day. Will have to do the "dip stick check" tomorrow since I primed the new oil filter, then tipped over the new oil can and now am unsure if there's 2.8 liter fresh oil in the engine... #clumsy #NekitaNet

2750 2018-01-12 18:18:26 Hey, but no offshore oil drilling, right?
2751 2018-01-12 18:18:09 DON'T SAY IT!!! You'll give some of the scam artists ideas!!!! They want an excuse for 65 (which they may try next week).

But good news with the oil rigs. So you're telling me US oil production isn't going to explode with these ridiculous prices? And China import news was great.
2752 2018-01-12 18:18:00 And don’t I know it. But that’s where the cheap oil is, so for now we’re screwed. I fought for my country because it was attacked, for our constitution and my brothers. However, I wouldn’t kill a cockroach for our politicians. Disgusting what we’ve seen from both parties. 
2753 2018-01-12 18:17:54 The olive oil is sublime

2760 2018-01-12 18:17:06 They are still oil paints, they have just made the oil into an emulsion so that it will mix with water. I don't think there should be any issues with archival qualities - instead of turpentine evaporating out, the water evaporates out. They dry just like normal oil paints.

2764 2018-01-12 18:16:46 193 out the door just for a diagnostic, a tire rotation, filling up transmission fluid and changing oil. I feel like I got ripped off...
2765 2018-01-12 18:16:42 Pretty embarrasing how we produce all the oil and have to pay more for gas than Americans do...
2766 2018-01-12 18:16:31 Disagree...Even Russian math of 11 mbd at 70 is better than 11.3 mbd at 50.  The math works this way for any oil selling nation in this deal.  Math 101 should always win over who swings the biggest stick.  At least that's what seems to be winning out here.
2767 2018-01-12 18:16:26 This oil makes my scalp feel good and fresh

2778 2018-01-12 18:15:02 Food fact: About 70% of olive oil being sold is not actually pure olive oil.
2779 2018-01-12 18:14:56 Read the article...she wears a patch and takes oil.  She’s not gonna light up a blunt in algebra class and smoke it.
2780 2018-01-12 18:14:54 They have lots of oil money
2781 2018-01-12 18:14:52 @KTNKenya @KTNNews @YussufIbra I was taught long time ago in primary school that "Water and Oil do not mix". Nairobi County decided to dispute this fact. They have failed with a thud. #FridayBriefing
2782 2018-01-12 18:14:48 Don't lie. It's a reserve of taxes on oil production & is a government fund..not an ALL people fund..
2783 2018-01-12 18:14:43 I just wanted to get my oil changed. I didn’t realize I was walking into a posturing gauntlet of incompetence.
2784 2018-01-12 18:14:19 It helped mine. I had very little oil peeking through at the end of the day.
2785 2018-01-12 18:14:17 Can someone some cornroll my hair i wan throw my wig on today I’m over this blow out it it’s all oily looking and I didn’t even oil it
2786 2018-01-12 18:14:12 Whacko! Build that Wall, build that Wall... And build oil rigs!!!
2787 2018-01-12 18:13:55 I bought an empty glass bottle, filled it with pure homemade expensive olive oil for a friend, and realised it doesn't have a kork or anything to be sealed with. Friday evening

2804 2018-01-12 18:12:14 Coconut oil has changed everything
2805 2018-01-12 18:12:10 What’s gorgeous about the Wa. & Or.  coastline is it’s rugged nature.  The power of the Pacific Ocean on display.  Oil rigs have a history of pollution, wind and wave turbines do not.  We don’t want oil/gas exploration off the PNW.

* Parents' early 80s Chevy Citation - transmission slipped...again
* Inherited 1981 Ford Mustang - block cracked in 89. Aunt had let it run out of oil at least 2x

2819 2018-01-12 18:10:41 Or you could just use glass and send them back to reuse. Way, way better than the others environmentally. 

Also, jugs probably recycle better than bags or cartons as bags tend to become trash when oil is “cheap”

2824 2018-01-12 18:10:20 So not only did I pay $600 for new tires but now I just got finessed to pay $165 for an oil change and an alignment. FUCKING JUST ROB ME WHY DONT YOU

2829 2018-01-12 18:09:53 OIL DIFF: 5.69 -> 5.71
2830 2018-01-12 18:09:52 It seemed clear (in my biased mind), that if oil ran back up, the better bet would be on electric vehicles, and not n.g.  But n.g. would've still been useful for big rigs, where more power is required than most batts can provide.

2837 2018-01-12 18:09:00 Hey, Olive Oil in a blonde wig: shut up.
2838 2018-01-12 18:09:00 Sure Mc Cain, or his complicity. Give Russia Syria. He has Israel and Saudi Arabia. Oil no? It’s all crap. Proxy wars. Trump supports putin. We all know that. Perhaps time you swing your considerable weight and call him out. Could be a great legacy.

Oil rig gain biggest rise since June.
The price of crude oil is trading up $0.07 or +0.11%.
2846 2018-01-12 18:08:26 So, he failed to see the long-term return to low oil prices, but all-in-all,  I thought it was a pretty solid play by him, all things considered.  Personally, I didn't like his plan because I had just finished helping raise VC $$ for an advanced tech battery maker.
2847 2018-01-12 18:08:23 The oil fund in Norway considers a natural resource like oil in the North Sea, belong to ALL its citizens, so they ALL profit, not just a handful of fat cats as in USA.  The money goes to provide education and healthcare.    In other words, they are civilized.

2871 2018-01-12 18:06:32 @GOP  We know that Trump is lying and Durbin didn't make that up.  He was clearly very troubled and would never have thrown oil on the fire of bipartisan talks.  Check out how many times a day Trump has lied while in office.
2872 2018-01-12 18:06:26 I can't believe the way the journos are trying to frame City and Pep as some saints just because they play pretty football, like they aren't a history free oil funded club that has paid over the odds time and again and just this past summer spent £140M on 3 fullbacks.
2873 2018-01-12 18:06:24 Is coconut oil good for you? Is it a good replacement for other oils?
2874 2018-01-12 18:06:08 And also, it seemed like we might just be experiencing a pull-back from peak oil prices, and that another run-up might be possible.  If oil had returned to $150/bbl, his plan probably would've gotten traction politically and economically.

2907 2018-01-12 18:04:07 @donlemon  While I deplore Trump's choice of words, it must be noted that the countries in Africa & many other states, condemned to exceptional poverty, are a direct result of demand for oil, minerals, labor(slavery) from the USA & EU.  CNN & others lack context.
2908 2018-01-12 18:04:02 Yes. The British brilliantly combated this by creating engines that sprayed rustproofer/motor oil about the chassis.
2909 2018-01-12 18:04:00 Can't agree more on stupidly managed American interventions. Saddam and Gaddafi were pretty dismal individuals but look at the state of both countries now especially Lybia which has even more oil than Iraq. Deplorable
2910 2018-01-12 18:03:52 Lol. For those of us who've lived in these places, it much ado about very little. My country of origin has no sewage system, barely any running water, barely any electricity. It's a major oil producer but has no refinery. Gas is imported. The truth is painful. #peacocking

3049 2018-01-12 17:50:58 What rubbish you talking about? Man United has more trophies & rich history while City has oil money. Show some respect for Jose, better coach than Pep
3050 2018-01-12 17:50:53 With our dependancy on oil going down, I'm hopeful the US will let them figure that out for themselves and stop imposing it on them.
3051 2018-01-12 17:50:46 What’s the point. It’s not saving the environment since the electricity used to power it comes from oil anyway
3052 2018-01-12 17:50:46 Fact# US is one of the largest consumers of diamonds and oil from Trump's #shithole countries.
3053 2018-01-12 17:50:35 “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it?
3054 2018-01-12 17:50:35 What’s an oil change?
3055 2018-01-12 17:50:35 1.12 cont.
Organic cabbage w/ feta Crispy Chickpeas and Coriander Vinaigrette                                          Red beets w/ kale olive oil salt md pepper
3056 2018-01-12 17:50:24 The horror, what's oil money come to ? Sigh
3057 2018-01-12 17:50:10 We need to reduce the cost of oil in order to pay for Obama care.
3058 2018-01-12 17:50:09 As it is impossible to mix oil & water so it is for a highly learned person to work under a semiliterate

"I want an oil diffuser" @OHSportsGirl
3060 2018-01-12 17:49:28 Kung minina na lang ng Pilipinas ang oil & gas sa West Philippines Sea at pinakinabangan ang mga isda at inexport, hindi na sana kailangan magtaas pa ng tax at mangutang ng bilyun-bilyun sa Tsina.

"I want an oil diffuser" @oh
3062 2018-01-12 17:49:17 I hate having to take my car for an oil change 
3063 2018-01-12 17:49:11 Girl don’t remind me  I’m trying my fucking next step is castor oil shit
3064 2018-01-12 17:49:01 @realDonaldTrump FYI, ‘shithole’ countries in Africa are built on gold, platinum, iron ore, diamonds, crude oil and many minerals you shitsunk western countries don’t have.
3065 2018-01-12 17:49:01 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。

3068 2018-01-12 17:48:56 At the minute they definitely are. But people seem to be conveniently forgetting that they got there through splashing the oil money!
3069 2018-01-12 17:48:37 Im a Birkenstock wearing, Kombucha making, essential oil using, chicken raising, vegetarian.... 
who am I??!! Hahah
3070 2018-01-12 17:48:28 Clove oil.
3071 2018-01-12 17:48:27 There’s this tiny Asian place called bashan in soho. They don’t have any super fancy decor but their food is amazing. They make a seabass in chili garlic oil and vermicelli noodles that I dream about. Then go to amorino for chocolate sorbet. 
Just trust me on this. 
3072 2018-01-12 17:48:15 Sometimes extreme cold weather can have an affect on heavy fuel demand and may play a small role in overall prices, but the largest factors remain the price of oil (which is now at its highest since 2014)- that's the largest issue presently.
3073 2018-01-12 17:48:14 @nadinebaggott I’ve recently discovered your channel and think you’re awesome! Just wondered if you could advise: I have an AHA, the ordinary retinol and use @KiehlsUK midnight face oil but not sure on frequency/weekly routine. You have so much content I don’t know where to start
3074 2018-01-12 17:48:09 Oil change is done.  Stupid synthetic oil, being all expensive.  I could run conventional but that would double my change frequency and cut out some wiggle room if I'm in a tight spot when it comes due.
3075 2018-01-12 17:48:02 I love a lot of Clinique's cosmetics, but I've never liked anything about their moisturizers (is that smell supposed to be good?) I use Aveeno; my mom used Oil of Olay during the day and Ponds at night.
3076 2018-01-12 17:48:01 only thing that an ending stocks reduction was bean oil, now also trading red
3077 2018-01-12 17:47:59 Actually there's a state-owned oil company I guess.
3078 2018-01-12 17:47:37 Nope. There is a great Atlantic Monthly article on it from a few years back. American labor got expensive, Norwegians were cheap so it moved there. Rise of oil and electricity came later.
3079 2018-01-12 17:47:08 Because of oil and fish everyone in Norway is a millionaire.
3080 2018-01-12 17:47:08 If Olive oil is made of Olives, what is Baby oil made of???
I also can't answer this hihi
3081 2018-01-12 17:47:07 Ninyo & Moore supported GGG Demolition, Inc. (GGG) with soil and groundwater bioremediation at the former General American Transportation Corporation - Los Angeles Marine Terminal, at the Port of Los Angeles’ Berths 171-173. Nearly 300K gallons of crude oil spilled in...

3083 2018-01-12 17:46:59 Yesterday my boss asked me what I was going to do with my Friday night off expecting me to say I’m getting black out drunk. Instead I said I was going to put some lavender oil in my diffuser read a good book and cuddle with miley. He looked slightly concerned.
3084 2018-01-12 17:46:57 Don’t try to make me a modern day snake oil salesman lol
3085 2018-01-12 17:46:52 More upside to come Alex. If Oil is not in an ascending wedge, it hardly has any resistance to the upside.
3086 2018-01-12 17:46:47 My man my son fr he bought some olive oil cause he's noticed my hair/ skin been poppin ever since I stared using it I lol
3087 2018-01-12 17:46:44 My Jesce marks are getting soo much better.. thank you pure coconut oil
3088 2018-01-12 17:46:36 Instead of growing the military budget, reduce it's size. We do not need a base in nearly every country on the planet. We do not need personnel across the globe. The whole middle east fiasco is due to greed for oil revenue and resources. Other countries' resources.
3089 2018-01-12 17:46:27 If I could stay in bed with my oil diffuser on, my speakers and my weed I’ll be set
3090 2018-01-12 17:46:19 This is largely due to taxes on oil profits being rolled over into their sovereign wealth fund. Good for Norway, but reproducible?
3091 2018-01-12 17:46:14 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr So oil is acting dumb again. Novak and Russia claim to want to discuss gradually exiting the "deal", and oil pops? The loons are still on the loose.
3092 2018-01-12 17:46:07 @bob_oil Yeah, let it probe a bit first. I’m betting there will be some short covering just ahead of earnings like last time. We’ll see. GL
3093 2018-01-12 17:46:06 Attention: I have gotten an oil change
3094 2018-01-12 17:46:04 $rcon Big buyer took out ask at 1.68 holding all.  Oil could open up over$70 next week
3095 2018-01-12 17:45:58 The point you are missing is 
No one is denying united spends money but saying  its city vs money when literally everyone knows city has been to where it is today because of oil money and have spent shitloads in summer
3096 2018-01-12 17:45:47 Nigeria got oil but the masses have no fuel.  African problems
3097 2018-01-12 17:45:27 WHEN HER PUSSY GOT MILES ON IT BUT YOU REALLY LIKE HER, SO YOU BECOME A LIL MECHANIC..
LIL TUNE UP/LIL OIL CHANGE..

3098 2018-01-12 17:45:16 That feeling when you realize your antique air-cooled motorcycle has three separate oil systems.
3099 2018-01-12 17:45:15 I agree. A lot of the South depend on oil field work. Always be growing and advancing.
3100 2018-01-12 17:44:59 Occupying in what capacity because we have stuck our hands into several African nations. Usually in reference to gold, oil, etc. but what we do is hide behind terrorism or human rights Syria, Libya, Egypt, Congo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone etc not to mention the entire Middle East
3101 2018-01-12 17:44:51 Pretty much any health food store/most supplement aisles! You can also find in straight up oil form but I like the capsules cuz shit is spicy af. The benefits of it are endless.
3102 2018-01-12 17:44:34 Actually, we don’t spend the oil money. We invest it and use the capital gains to cover a small annual budget deficit.
3103 2018-01-12 17:44:27 Radial engines do have oil and valve seal issues more frequently than other engines. Also do NOT get an automatic RX8, they are trash. Other than that, go with your gut!
3104 2018-01-12 17:44:23 You know what doesn't give a damn about the President's alleged comments? The entire stock market! DOW is up roughly 180 pts alone..S&P 14 NAS 39..gold, silver & oil ALL up.  #MAGA
3105 2018-01-12 17:44:23 Problem doesn’t want oil drilling in front of Mar-A-Lago!
3106 2018-01-12 17:44:22 @FoxNews @CNN@MSNBC  #shithole  Let’s all thank @realDonaldTrump for bringing ua out of the shithole that BHO put us in with his snake oil pitch of shovel ready jobs that were never found
3107 2018-01-12 17:44:12 Looks like it has Canola Oil 
3108 2018-01-12 17:44:08 We have a lot of good things to say about the direction of oil prices and that we have found a top tier field in Kakwa that transcends policy choices. 

Maybe play your stock meme again if AB policy is so great for us.
3109 2018-01-12 17:43:54 City will never be our biggest rivals, they might be the best team in the league this year.... but city are a small club that was even smaller before oil money.... Liverpool will always be our biggest rival, maybe not the best but definitely the biggest.
3110 2018-01-12 17:43:49 Media isn't faking GENOCIDE & WAR CRIMES, in YEMEN ... or FORCIBLY OCCUPYING #Syria, a sovereign nation, in HOPES of CO-OPTING #Assad's OIL. These are, most assuredly, NOT #FakeNews.

3119 2018-01-12 17:42:41 Tate is the cornerstone of the team. He is the Bugatti that new coaches should want to drive.  You don’t hand the keys of your brand new Bugatti to a person who might run it in a ditch or burn up the engine because He forgot an oil change. You hand it to a QB whisperer or QB pro.

3132 2018-01-12 17:41:23 When you say overseas, I want to know how many live in 3rd world countries and what they do. Not missionaries, consulate staffers or the ones that work in multinationals, oil coys etc. and live like Kings.

3149 2018-01-12 17:39:56 I'm confused when oil prices are at their highest in 3-4 years shouldn't gas prices go down since the companies are making more money?! But I'm just a middle class slave what do I know
3150 2018-01-12 17:39:53 Because US-assholes like you made them to shithole countries with your slavery, imperialism, war, greed for oil, disrespect and lack of humanity in combination with ignorance. 

Let's be honest. Call it like it is.

3153 2018-01-12 17:39:36 It's just oil in water. The oil clumps are useful as a detergent for disrupting other oily elements
3154 2018-01-12 17:39:31 I own $CVX, $COP, $CLR, $EOG, $PE, $ETP as part of a basket trade. Global oil inventories are still elevated but commodities tend to outperform late cycle and dollar weakness is supporting /CL price action.

3157 2018-01-12 17:38:34 Very little. We reinvest all the oil proceeds and live off the capital gains. Quite after Trump’s heart, I imagine.

3160 2018-01-12 17:38:27 I would have changed the lyrics to "We built Man City on Arab oil". Sounds better and matches the syllables and rhyming of the original song
3161 2018-01-12 17:38:23 Norway is a horrible comparison, I tell you why.  They heavily rely on oil and their immigration?  Top 4 nations:  Poland (most by far) Lithuania, Sweden, Somalia, Germany

They are homogeneous, not very welcoming it seems of immigrants from just anywhere,U.S is.  They see racist
3162 2018-01-12 17:38:04 I’ve been trying to take my car to get an oil change all week haven’t made it yet doesn’t look like it’s going to happen today either

3169 2018-01-12 17:37:18 Lol i apologize sir. I will replace the oil
3170 2018-01-12 17:37:10 Finding out after cooking that the oil you used had a best before date of March 2017 
3171 2018-01-12 17:37:08 It's time @Nigeria @AsoRock understand that more electric cars bought is less oil and thinner revenue for oil dependence . Thus useless petrol cars will be dumped in Africa as cheap cars. Timeline short
3172 2018-01-12 17:37:00 Norway banked oil money which technically makes ever Norway citizen a millionaire.

3184 2018-01-12 17:35:19 @Refreshco_ca does applying coconut oil to your hair trigger acne on cheeks?
3185 2018-01-12 17:35:18 Oil doesn't just naturally spill out of the ground & definitely not in the amounts like what we saw in the Gulf Coast. We don't need to exploit fossil fuels in exchange for possibly destroying Millions of miles of pristine coastline & income for tens of thousands of people
3186 2018-01-12 17:35:06 Hmm most places are like oil companies with graphic design but since you paint a lot I would say what about doing classes at painting with a twist

3189 2018-01-12 17:34:46 Time to take care of my car today. In getting the oil change done. Then getting lunch. Then going to get the new tire put on since it came in this morning.
3190 2018-01-12 17:34:41 videos on the oil industry was shocking, but I am afraid that Cooper's book will have more of an impact upon me.
3191 2018-01-12 17:34:38 Too beautiful for a single drop of oil. Needs to be protected.
3192 2018-01-12 17:34:12 You're assuming the oil that is being drilled for is for local/regional use - which is ignorant - almost all of it is exported, just like the pipelines.  LEARN to live in reality.
3193 2018-01-12 17:34:10 Why Kia trying to sell me a new car while I’m getting my oil changed on the Kia I already own /:
3194 2018-01-12 17:34:08 Spot on mate. Couldn't agree more. Oil money is the only reason anyone knows who the fuck they are
3195 2018-01-12 17:33:49 woke up early to get my oil changed & a cold brew & i just finished buying my Crush Dallas ticket. Issa good friday 
3196 2018-01-12 17:33:47 I won't call it sleepless, but yes, they will be burning the midnight oil for sure
3197 2018-01-12 17:33:34 Norway, a major oil producer, has harnessed its energy earnings into a giant pension fund worth over $1 trillion. The government uses the fund, one of the largest in the world, to divvy out pensions and other government expenses. Source: CNN
3198 2018-01-12 17:33:16 All true! But I always feel compelled to point out that Norway gained this lifestyle thanks to massive drilling and sales of oil. Plus, it’s dark there all winter. Just saying.
3199 2018-01-12 17:33:16 Gonna try some more steaks with the sous vide, this time with no olive oil. One steak in a sesame sauce marinade and another in, and I hope this works, a coke marinade.
3200 2018-01-12 17:33:15 Wow I had no idea Alberta's carbon tax caused oil and gas capex to decline not just in Alberta but around the world - worse than anyone thought! /s

3210 2018-01-12 17:31:46 Hobbies can take a bunch of time. I'm in two bands, have gigs coming up. Charting songs, scales, arpeggios. This in addition to chores around the house and maintaining vehicles. Just ordered parts from @amazon (air filter, spark plugs, cabin filter, oil filter).
3211 2018-01-12 17:31:39 The #USDollar is taking an absolute beating today, breaking through key support. This helps lift #commodities like #gold, #silver and #oil, keeping the reflation trade intact. With the Dollar collapse, multi-national earnings expectations will rise on the currency conversion.
3212 2018-01-12 17:31:35 Only 5 hours of sleep  Time to do this oil change/tire rotation.
3213 2018-01-12 17:31:14 pep or Jose ? Money or History ? Oil or class ?
3214 2018-01-12 17:31:08 Same countries that cause the problems are the main culprits who profit the most off geopolitical premiums that are attached to oil...
OPEC yearly meeting notes use to be online...but not sure now...
Quite telling...
3215 2018-01-12 17:31:01 Just temporarily don’t forget that with the price oil going up which means gasoline is going up which means groceries are going up so all of that money were getting from our tax cut is going to corporations who by the way got a permanent tax cut so they’re getting more money

3218 2018-01-12 17:30:51 your forgot 'stop producing oil'.
3219 2018-01-12 17:30:49 What more sanctions? Why aren't Vietnam, China and Laos being sanctioned for being Communist countries.

Heck Cuba doesn't even threaten to nuke the US like N. Korea does

The reason is you need to have a lot of oil or kowtow to the US to have the privilege of trading with them.

3225 2018-01-12 17:30:37 @GinaRaimondo What is your response to opening up our coastlines to drilling? Have you talked to the president about it? Rhode Islanders do not want oil rigs off our beautiful coastlines.
3226 2018-01-12 17:30:33 The money Norway makes from the natural resource of North Sea oil goes into an “oil fund” and belongs to ALL the people of Norway, not just a few oil wealthy barons as in USA.   Everyone benefits.   What a novel idea, eh Rex?
3227 2018-01-12 17:30:28 Rock bottom or Turning Point night! Go Oilers Go!
3228 2018-01-12 17:30:22 It's only in this country that you see people carry generators to a filling station In Our Country Nigeria As an oil producer. Bet me : this country will only be good when immunity from law is removed and parliamentary system restored

My husband can’t change the oil in my car, but he can make me a roast and macaroons and I’m cool with that. 
3231 2018-01-12 17:30:05 some have a bit of oil in that stops it splitting, those are better
3232 2018-01-12 17:30:05 Needed a line up and oil change today but it’s gon have to wait til I see what this weather gon do
3233 2018-01-12 17:30:04 Most crude oil traders do not know how crude oil trading functions
3234 2018-01-12 17:29:54 A week into “pursuing you” he’s paying for your oil change and brakes? Y’all got the juice. I was drinking water

3236 2018-01-12 17:29:44 Craving oil money.
3237 2018-01-12 17:29:23 Many people don’t know how to change their oil. I change mine b/c I was raised to but also b/c if I do it $22 and if I have someone else it’s $54. Minimum wage needs to be raised but I can’t control it. The $250 cost of a ticket from taillights is a lot for most people to absorb.
3238 2018-01-12 17:29:21 The economy of Venezuela was an entirely phony economy run only for the benefit of the oil corporations. Once Citgo, Exxon, BP etc. were thrown out the economy collapsed. In all honesty, those corporations were only out for themselves. Venezuela will be better off without them.
3239 2018-01-12 17:29:10 You seem to have bought into the environmental misinformation. Visit oil country and see how nice it is. All the country would benefit, not just a few
3240 2018-01-12 17:29:07 Bro this @GuillemBalague clown says it's either city or money in sanchez's decision. He is a anti United clown. Firstly Where does he fit in in the city team? Secondly money? Isn't city the team owned by an oil sheikh last time I checked. Thirdly city havnt won shit!
3241 2018-01-12 17:28:47 My baby hairs are kinda like Joe Dirt on the oil rig.
3242 2018-01-12 17:28:46 Oh no poor kiddo hope he gets relief & feeling better soon. Have you tried essential oils? My bro & mom have asthma. They’ve been using doterra “breathe” oil & it helps them A LOT!! Esp when my bro had upper resiratory infection last wk!
3243 2018-01-12 17:28:45 Lets mine some coal there! Drill for oil! Mine uranium! I think the government should investigate the possibilities that are under this 1.300 acres.... cant see the #DonaldJTrump having any problems with that... or is it just okay under other peoples homes?
3244 2018-01-12 17:28:43 Make sure it's had the engine rebuilt fairly recently. Rotary engines blow seals at around 80k miles. Also be prepared for the running costs. You'll need to fill it with oil at around every second fuel stop and the thing will get 23 miles per gallon maximum
3245 2018-01-12 17:28:42 O i had a weird thing w argan oil i used to put it on my face as a kid bc idk what the fuck i was doing but isnxinwojxone and also dude ur hair sounds like a nightmare to take care of noah fence but i cant imagine how it must be FOR U
3246 2018-01-12 17:28:41 Well if there’s an oil shortage in WA we know who to blame  #shinybum
3247 2018-01-12 17:28:38 Dropped my car off for oil change!
3248 2018-01-12 17:28:32 @PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell @HerreraBeutler I know you love Washington state. So what EXACTLY are you doing to stop the offshore oil from coming to the Washington coast? We're being punished for being a 'Democratic' state.
3249 2018-01-12 17:28:30 Lmao naw thats my time. I dont want no nigga next to me getting a pedi. All I need is some lotion & oil. He be good
3250 2018-01-12 17:28:27 我的车很小毛病，不过每次小毛病都会破费不小。比如换个oil pump, 要花差不多$1200,零件只400多块，剩下全是人工费。

3252 2018-01-12 17:28:15 Because they didn't have money and none of their current fans knew they existed. United fans that say United didn't spend are idiots or very young but it still can't be compared to what Chelsea/City did to the market with their oil money. But it is what it is. Gotta learn to deal
3253 2018-01-12 17:28:10 Crypto isn't back on gold standard.. Ha. Well either is the usd... OPEC and oil purchases are the only thing the usd is clinging to.. When oil has its own blockchain and no needs the usd.. There will be an econinc crisis.. They will start a war before losing oil based on usd
3254 2018-01-12 17:27:52 I've always done raw, but either is fine as long as it's not cooked with any salt/pepper/oil.

3256 2018-01-12 17:27:26 Economic downturn due to lower crude oil prices. Shrinking of the private sector and currency issues. Their economic model was unsustainable. Too bad nice place, nice people.
3257 2018-01-12 17:27:05 The real “shit hole” in this debate is the UN, criticising Western countries for not taking in enough ‘refugees’ when they won’t order oil rich Arab nations to do so.

3259 2018-01-12 17:26:42 Outbidding our oil rich rivals who are running away with the league to sign another rivals top player? Sounds like a statement of intent for me
3260 2018-01-12 17:26:27 What aboot the oil price Andrew!  Is that not worth a mention?
3261 2018-01-12 17:26:11 Since when you had to make an appointment to get your damn oil changed 
3262 2018-01-12 17:26:05 For soft silky hair, massage strands with coconut oil 2-3 times a week!
3263 2018-01-12 17:25:52 In our study, coconut oil did not raise ‘bad’ cholesterol, despite being high in saturated fat. It also seemed to increase ‘good’ cholesterol. Why do you state coconuts oil 'SEEMED' to increase 'good' cholesterol when it went up by 14% in only 4 weeks? Thanks.
3264 2018-01-12 17:25:45 When you mix water and oil, you end up with City Hall under Sonko-Igathe. 
3265 2018-01-12 17:25:43 Do you believe that it is?  If you don't, Norway's economy is problematic.  40% of export revenue comes from Oil and NG.  12% of GDP.

3295 2018-01-12 17:22:01 fair, my original point was only that lettuce is a good flavor neutral medium for when you don’t want green-y flavor. It’s like the difference between a neutral oil and olive oil, the latter tastes better but the former is useful and unobtrusive in some contexts

3308 2018-01-12 17:20:41 We're going to drill for oil off the entire coast of the U.S., but not Florida. B/c the skinhead gov asked you? Yup. Go tell it to someone who buys your shit.
3309 2018-01-12 17:20:36 Because they were not corrupt they invested the oil money found in a hedge fund.  That is why they have a better rate of living than Americans, they are right after Luxembourg.  Unfortunately for Mr. trump they will not b visiting.

3319 2018-01-12 17:19:39 Is that a farmland? Thats Benue through, irrespective of the situation they shouldn't kill peoples livestock ,knowing the ideology of those people towards their animals and think they'll sleep well,we should stop deceiving ourselves,plus this is just a tip of an iceberg
3320 2018-01-12 17:19:32 Richard, you are so right, it is a very precarious balance and as oil prices rises, then unconventional bbls flood the market, so prices go down again...
3321 2018-01-12 17:19:20 Awwh, thank you! I have some girl scout cookies and Chocolope mixed here along with a cup of coffee with my own special oil in it, I'd offer a cup if I could.
3322 2018-01-12 17:19:19 This govt is a big failure in terms of giving employment, their stand on reservation, price hike in diesel and petrol despite crude oil is cheaper. 
On FDI they used to be against it now they are doing same. Now on the judiciary system.
3323 2018-01-12 17:19:18 that’s why coconut oil is soooooo good cos it’s natural and less likely to sting or make it worse after exfoliating xx
3324 2018-01-12 17:19:16 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
3325 2018-01-12 17:19:15 ETP looks like it hit a bottom, w the cold snap and higher oil prices, we should see higher earnings bcuz of locked in oil futures
3326 2018-01-12 17:19:12 btindle:  $/NG Moving along with oil here, watch $3.2 on the long side for potential resistance.
3327 2018-01-12 17:18:49 Oil makes the world go roundddd
3328 2018-01-12 17:18:49 Those people need their heads read. You sold out your states environmental beauty for oil and gas contributions. PS any comments on the racist running your party ?
3329 2018-01-12 17:18:47 Going to invest in a humidifier and oil diffuser on payday bc wow I’m missing out
3330 2018-01-12 17:18:45 There are so many factors in the mix today. It goes way beyond Kalergi. And before him, as you state in another post. The House of Hanover complexities and reach are fascinating. The emergence of the oil states. The elites always find a way to cling on to power. Pragmatic, always
3331 2018-01-12 17:18:40 It's now a full fletched attack to get Norway iron & Oil 
3332 2018-01-12 17:18:37 And where is the vote funding CHIP? What did you vote to gut the ACA with your sell out to the oil companies with the vote for the disastrous tax bill? Yeah, legislator of the year. But not in the good way.
3333 2018-01-12 17:18:35 Are they as excited as you are about the oil drilling bribe?
3334 2018-01-12 17:18:28 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from?

3336 2018-01-12 17:18:19 My doctor has me on oil.
3337 2018-01-12 17:18:15 Fergie undoubtedly played his part. But RvP acknowledged that playing for Manchester United, given their status in world football, was a big factor when it came to making a decision. United are real deal; City still bling, an oil sheikh's plaything.
3338 2018-01-12 17:18:14 America has reduces its importation of our oil.
3339 2018-01-12 17:18:06 Simple, because the complex glands in your face don’t have enough kinetic energy during the day to retract the oil in your pores through reverse osmosis.
3340 2018-01-12 17:18:03 Now imagine a few oil rigs sprinkled in the waters of each of those views
3341 2018-01-12 17:18:01 It would make a difference being managed in a way that doesn’t make a loss. the UK must be the only place in the world that pays oil company’s more to extract it than what they get back

3380 2018-01-14 23:56:12 I don’t use toad oil……;it’s a different direction, and it really.
3381 2018-01-14 23:55:50 I'm not in favour of govt handout to any company, was very vocal when oil companies got oil sand handouts. By the way that incl pro sport franchises.

3391 2018-01-14 23:54:43 So if i saved 4 grand a month in just income tax i could easily pay my own health care and invest in bitcoin.  Sounds like moving to the states is getting better and better!   Most oil companies treat their employees really well too so it wouldnt be that high

3397 2018-01-14 23:53:48 MCT oil. Start real slow (1/2 tsp) and build up slowly. Trust me, too much at once will give you explosive shits. I now do a 1 oz shot in the morning. Really helped with memory.

3404 2018-01-14 23:53:10 On no. Mona must have known because she said she hoped you'd get better. I had these for a while and started using a combo of Roemary+Basil essential oils (one drop each, diluted with a tbspn. of olive or jojoba oil) applied to my wrists and inhaled. Also Ylang ylang is good.
3405 2018-01-14 23:52:51 I would argue the price of oil is manipulated as much as the price of gold
3406 2018-01-14 23:52:40 The difference between shale oil and our conventional and oil sands oil. Oil production in Canada is at record highs but our industry has found ways to operate with less labour.

3413 2018-01-14 23:51:52 Your money grabber comment insinuates that Alexis was going to be an unpaid volunteer at man city and that's just dumb opinion to have. They offered Kaka the kind of oil money that would rival some countries' GDPs. Alexis was getting paid either way.
3414 2018-01-14 23:51:34 I waited for the pan to get really hot before putting the oil in. I used extra virgin oil.

3418 2018-01-14 23:51:03 This is crazy. City are entirely dependent on an oil Kingdom's money to fuel their unprecedented spending. 

One fairly modest unbeaten run and the football world has completely lost touch with  history and reality.

3460 2018-01-14 23:45:04 Seriously don't we all have moisturising routines?

In Winter: moisturise with an oil when your body is still wet then go over with a cream. Then use a lighter oil or glycerin based product for your face.

Summer: use a healing oil like Vitamin E then go over with sunscreen.

3467 2018-01-14 23:43:30 This lady pulls up to my work in ‘64 impala for a oil change. She says for 2 grand she’ll sell it to me but “warning” it needs a lot of work.... Do I do it? 
3468 2018-01-14 23:43:20 Pine oil heaven
3469 2018-01-14 23:43:11 Burnt some olive oil in the stove. My house is smokier than a Christmas party in 1984.
3470 2018-01-14 23:42:59 Or check the oil on your son's vehicle!
3471 2018-01-14 23:42:55 Olive oil soaked into both sides
3472 2018-01-14 23:42:17 All these people needs calm down with City proganda  do they have any player from academy nope did win any single trophy b4 oil money no Shaun goater is the legend no offence thanks
3473 2018-01-14 23:42:17 This was supposed to be America's exorbitant privilege, we print dollars send them abroad and get free stuff including oil and other commodities. "It's our currency but it's your problem," declared Treasury Sec Connally defensively. Everyone loved it except outside America.
3474 2018-01-14 23:42:11 They do generate their own money, its called selling oil.
3475 2018-01-14 23:42:11 While I'm a purist & also prefer butter - it makes sense in a food-science sort of way. Consider mayo is mostly oil and eggs, it could be good.

As with most foods, it's probably worth experimenting with once.

3477 2018-01-14 23:41:54 @Walmart PLEASE TELL ME WHY MY BOYFRIEND AND I JUST WAITED AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR HIS CAR TO BE DONE GETTING AN OIL CHANGE FOR THE AUTO CENTER GUY TO TELL US THEY “RAN OUT OF OIL” ??????? YOU GUYS LITERALLY SELL OIL ON THE SHELF!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE FRICK
3478 2018-01-14 23:41:50 Imagine running out of oil on a night like this, baltic !
3479 2018-01-14 23:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
3480 2018-01-14 23:41:44 Far less than trump has cost us ., but you patriots don't care about waste at the top,  only the bottom. How much do oil n gas subsidies cost us? Look it up!
3481 2018-01-14 23:41:43 City fans moaning about us spending our own money if it wasn't for your oil rich owners you'd still be getting beat 8.1 by Middlesbrough 
3482 2018-01-14 23:41:14 I got to kiss the hottest girl ive ever seen last night and she gave me an oil massage afterwards so why am I still depressed???
3483 2018-01-14 23:40:54 Kale chips: 175-200 degree oven, cut out central stem, mix with olive oil, salt, pepper, and nutritional yeast if you like umami taste. Lay flat on cookie sheet and bake for about 20 min. The kale should have a dried consistency. Very tasty!
3484 2018-01-14 23:40:53 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
3485 2018-01-14 23:40:45 The USA dont need to import Oil anymore. In fact they now export it. America is not a free meal ticket for you. You are not entiteled to cost them jobs just because you want a hand out.
3486 2018-01-14 23:40:34 The difference an oil boom makes
3487 2018-01-14 23:40:28 Today has been a day. Nick’s car got scratched up while getting an oil change, his aunt is unresponsive in ICU, and I broke my glasses in half. There will be ice cream. There will be bourbon.

3489 2018-01-14 23:40:23 Understand that without oil we don't function not yet maybe some time but not yet
3490 2018-01-14 23:40:21 Mayo?!  I can understand olive oil, since that's a frequent replacement for butter with bread, but mayo is simply abominable.
3491 2018-01-14 23:40:19 OIL DIFF: 5.62 -> 5.77
3492 2018-01-14 23:40:12 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
3493 2018-01-14 23:40:02 You mean, your investment advisor's name is JESUS?  WOW? That's fascinating. My mom's advisor's name is Mike. But he doesn't  dork for Scottrade, so they probably don't know each other. My mom was advised to invest in oil. Good luck with your RR investment!
3494 2018-01-14 23:39:55 Whipped up a coconut oil & avocado hair mask to wear while tackling my inbox. Now if only I had @Starbucks, I’d be golden.
3495 2018-01-14 23:39:47 Mayo is vile and butter is the only true grilling oil for this sandwich.

3502 2018-01-14 23:38:48 So ironic when City fans start talking about money being the reason why Sanchez would choose united when city are a club who would be in division 2 without that oil money
3503 2018-01-14 23:38:45 I take something that my doc gave me. I have had Excedrin migraine too and Advil. And some THC oil and nothing has helped :(

3512 2018-01-14 23:37:29 Which one of you guys signed up my business e-mail for VIP life coaches from Dubai and a cannabis oil research job application?

I don't know if I hate you or love your sense of humor.
3513 2018-01-14 23:37:04 Yeh, let’s not pretend that City only started existing in 2008 because of some of the richest oil tycoons in the world...
3514 2018-01-14 23:36:37 @MajorPayne777 i bet when the dollar does bounce, oil gold AND the market will reverse at the same time. DRIP will be a huge play then

A nice cheap meal I make is rice, fried (after being cook obvs) in sesame oil, add in some frozen veg which defrosts/cooks, then add in half cooked scrambled egg and stir until egg is cooked through. Egg fried rice!

3523 2018-01-14 23:35:59 Yes.  I love Senator Bill Nelson.  Trump wants buddy Gov. Scott to run for Nelson's seat so they will do whatever to make Scott look good.  Then also, Mar-a-Logo looks out at ocean. T doesn't want to see oil rigs.  OK for everybody else to look at him. Always thinking of himself.
3524 2018-01-14 23:35:57 Trump doesn't want ugly oil rigs ruining the view from Mar al Lago.

3529 2018-01-14 23:34:53 Beyond sad. What is the real cost of continuing the use of oil? It is unimaginable. When is the global community going to wrap its collective head around this? We are destroying the atmoshere, environment and health of every living creature.
3530 2018-01-14 23:34:45 Oil price went up. Isn't that the reason?
3531 2018-01-14 23:34:20 I was shopping and I passed by a jar of pure Alaskan salmon oil but I didn't see the salmon part so I spent a full minute trying to figure out what the hell pure alaskan oil was
3532 2018-01-14 23:34:17 Israel is developing cannabis oil in tab/paper form so you just put it under your tongue and you feel the effects a couple seconds later

3534 2018-01-14 23:34:03 what he wants is for us to buy more and he wants to tax our export to the US and he is not too bright because what we buy form the US we can buy in many countries we supply 68% of the electric power  to the US and OIl gold  water uranium
3535 2018-01-14 23:33:52 Yeah, I like the Glossier. It smells nice. And the shower oil is nice. I'm not a fan of Kiehl's. The First Aid is fine. I love Caudalie. And I'm on a Deciem kick right now.
3536 2018-01-14 23:33:47 Oil on the rise
3537 2018-01-14 23:33:46 Who cares? Its our money - money that WE earn, by the way, not gained from Arab oil.

3549 2018-01-14 23:32:13 Trolls who have no idea of Canadian economics.  Which is why many of us are leaving for the states.  Myself included.  Waiting on that visa to come to oil country and make fat stacks!
3550 2018-01-14 23:32:07 Tic-tac-toe.  5-2 Oilers. Johnston buries it back door. Mullen and Kemkaran-Humble.
3551 2018-01-14 23:32:01 The scary part is, suppose these morons win, like they did against big tobacco (not because they’re correct but maybe the oil companies strike crazy deals to avoid drawn out litigation)—what will gasoline & heating oil cost?

But but we are historic & we have history & if we spend alot its allowed because we have history we are a big club with many fans & if we lose its because of the referee & man city wins because of oil money 

Most immature, Dumb fanbase in the world.

Don't @ me.
3560 2018-01-14 23:29:51 I painted that oil digitally.

3570 2018-01-14 23:27:21 If we don't do it someone else will and we won't get oil!

3578 2018-01-14 23:25:55 Flax seed oil polymerization was a little too much for me. I might just stick with Olive Oil to season my cast iron.
3579 2018-01-14 23:25:52 Norway has the highest standard of living - because of their North Sea oil drilling.  Would love for Maine to follow that model.

3584 2018-01-14 23:25:21 Incorrect - Trump is a strong advocate for Clean Air and Water. Remember the Flint water crisis and the Deep Water Horizon oil spill disaster occurred during the 8 yr Obama administration thanks to his corrupt cabinet.

3597 2018-01-14 23:23:38 2. Our motivation was not cheap oil. We didn’t stop the Shah or others in the ME from nationalizing their oil reserves years later. We didn’t stop Mexico from doing so decades before.

3599 2018-01-14 23:23:25 ExxonMobil produces a Million Bbls/day of oil daily in Nigeria, while Chevron produces 500000bbbls/day. To a foolish, idiot like you, it is a shithole. Don't worry , the American companies in Nigeria will soon go back to their shitpresident.
3600 2018-01-14 23:23:16 Oxiclean and those tide pens work exactly as well as the box says - I swear by ’em. Also Dawn dish soap for collars, the one they use to clean ducks in oil spills
3601 2018-01-14 23:23:13 LOL...a company called GOTCO went out of business in 1984 making big bets that cyclical arrivals of many VLCCs at one time would mean a bearish flood of oil. A million bbls of floating oil can have interesting m-t-m when one is on the wrong side of it.  Multiply that by 15 or 20!

3606 2018-01-14 23:22:40 Really that's interesting. Last year was our first year growing canola and it didn't do to bad considering our lack of moisture but it would be nice to fill the oil seed rotation with a crop that isn't quiet as greedy for inputs.

3610 2018-01-14 23:22:03 So nothing to do with not having recovered from WW2, the disintegration of the Empire, OPEC distorting the oil market leading to the 1973 oil crisis? It was all down to Labour and the unions... Sure...

3613 2018-01-14 23:21:49 Where do you put limits around "due to pipelines"? Coal-fired steep production for pipes? Emissions from cars driven by steelworkers to plants? Upstream oil and gas emissions are not due to pipelines.

3617 2018-01-14 23:21:13 That would be too simple, to obvious. After 9/11 we all knew the world was going to change, the oil companies and the bankers who run this world set up the foundations for #tidepodgate . you really think the 2016 election was real? no it was a distraction, we need to wake up.

3629 2018-01-14 23:20:17 In Moscow, Sean Spicer persuades Rick Perry that several Senators are drilling for oil. The gardener pirates movies.
3630 2018-01-14 23:20:04 You were the oil to my water
3631 2018-01-14 23:20:01 That is quite probably true ; just as LBJ kept both Fla Senators in his pocket for the Great Society by denying his Big Oil crony's off shore Fla since  the 60's.A policy which has been renewed by every Pres. since. Politics and money are always in conflict.

3635 2018-01-14 23:19:21 Trump is a strong advocate for Clean Water and Clean Air. Coal needs to contribute if we have to reduce the US’s energy bill. The US still remains the largest importer of crude oil by far.

Putin wants climate change to help melt the Siberian permafrost so that oil/gas/coal/minerals are easier to get to

3659 2018-01-14 23:15:37 Floridians have fought against politicians (Rep) tooth and nail regarding oil drilling and fracking for years/decades. We love our environment, and get in our reps' faces about it. Many of us believe 45 and Scott arranged this exclusion gift for Scott's upcoming Senate run.

3663 2018-01-14 23:14:54 Not to mention the efforts to use "not really endangered" species such as the Lesser Prairie Chicken to shut down oil drilling in Texas, OK and several other states. The removal of the threat of new regulations means as much as the roll back.
3664 2018-01-14 23:14:50 This is why I advocate Meritocracy. I would go as far as to suggest that if we are to survive the coming oil crisis and climate change problems that will hit us starting in about 2050 and over a period of 1000 years (re the climate) we will need to eliminate democracy.
3665 2018-01-14 23:14:50 This is what I was talking about.  The military has the capability to put up temporary housing, electric grids, bridges, and ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS NEEDED  within a week.

The palm oil issue is also close to my heart, so if you can move to palm-oil free you'll make me very happy! I can't wait to become a regular customer from now on 
3908 2018-01-14 22:39:31 He lies EVERY DAY! He didn’t even mention Hawaii until today! He is definitely a RACIST! He is going to crap all over our environment. I LIKE CLEAN AIR and WATER!! He is a BIG OIL LOVER! He’s even crapping all over protections for animals! He is a MONSTER!

3910 2018-01-14 22:39:25 @FosterFarms love your chicken strips have no added hormones or steroids but using soybean oil(excitotoxin) & regular wheat still kills our health. How about dropping the soy & using nonGMO wheat

Yes, @realDonaldTrump wakes up each day w/the intent 2 destroy something good!
3934 2018-01-14 22:36:20 Oil went from $42 to over $68 since Trump took office. How is gas cheaper then? I don't get it?

3952 2018-01-14 22:34:03 “You pray. You anoint with oil. You pray some more. 

Then you wait.”
3953 2018-01-14 22:33:59 I got different products. Like when I want a wash & go, or to tame the frizz, I always run some Moroccan oil or soy oil through my hair. That makes a huge difference.
3954 2018-01-14 22:33:55 Dear God,This man has the faith,but has lost his way.  He will receive oil after he repents.   Read the story of Esther Rev   She saved the Jews! Correct   Esther 2018 will save the Christians.

3956 2018-01-14 22:33:12 Between tamanu oil and rosehip oil, which one better to fading acne scars and dark spots? Which one the most effective?
3957 2018-01-14 22:33:04 Yes and we have Charles recipe. But new oil must have been preparedfir CII. Maybe another recipe?

3962 2018-01-14 22:32:18 Agreed about cost of oil but uncertainty over currency, eu membership etc won't wash with the electorate
3963 2018-01-14 22:31:39 Excellent.  Let's use more gas and oil so we can drill more in protected areas.  Super idea, Spanky!

3967 2018-01-14 22:30:16 Every country in the world was self sufficient within their own means. The trading of the old was mostly luxury items. Oil changed all of that. Now as we move towards renewables, EU, UN will hold less and less power. The stick of oil embargo won’t hold countries in line for long.

3977 2018-01-14 22:29:11 He WAS scheduled to appear before a committee looking into corruption with Venezuela's oil company but that had nothing to do with the Clintons.  That asshat Cernovich is partially responsible for creating this urban legend.
3978 2018-01-14 22:28:48 If you cook it in coconut oil it makes it easy to scrape into trashbin
3979 2018-01-14 22:28:16 Everyone knows that @DineshDSouza is an oil painting. What else could excuse his sexist remarks about which women are attractive? Looks are sooooo much more important than intelligence and accomplishment.
3980 2018-01-14 22:28:14 I guess toners remove oil and makeup and junk and astringents are often made with alcohol and clean the skin and close pores?

3988 2018-01-14 22:27:01 Greetings from Murray Arena. Oilers are taking on the Bisons today.
3989 2018-01-14 22:26:43 Oil is a commodity, a resource, & a TOOL. Yes a tool, much like a hammer, or screw driver, or wrench. When oil is used to lubricate, or animate robotic limbs it is a tool. So why does industry dispose of it. Don’t throw tools away. Oil Reclamation - Do it!
3990 2018-01-14 22:26:43 Its our money. From we make not oil money

4004 2018-01-14 22:23:55 The Iranian families blame will blame the government and Khamenei for the death of oil crew members for not rescuing them. He only cares about power and spreading fear throughout the Middle East! Death to Khamenei!  #IranProtests
4005 2018-01-14 22:23:52 Take all favorite green veggies + a few shallots, roast w/a bit of oil, S&P, garlic powder until they are browned.  Put them in a blender w whichever stock (veggie/chicken) u prefer.  Add more S&P and garlic powder to taste.  If you want a thicker soup, add a can of white beans.

4011 2018-01-14 22:22:55 There you go! It's Paul Ryan's wet dream to completely collapse Medicaid, food stamps, welfare. Donald Trump has already cut off heating oil assistance to the poor and elderly. And I read today that DT wants to deport the 800,000 DACA kids. There is going to be an all out revolt.
4012 2018-01-14 22:22:54 I hate auto correct
4013 2018-01-14 22:22:54 You are not being sincere!!! And please check your conscience if you are not sentimental! I have confirmed growth in employment, growth in income tax, griwth in agricultural produce, growth in non oil rev, unprecedented growth in government tax revenue! Growth in Infrastructures

4016 2018-01-14 22:22:26 I agree and understand that mag oil doesn't raise serum levels, but I have seen a local therapeutic effect often enough to credit its potentially different benefit: local increase, not systemic. Thoughts?

4040 2018-01-14 22:19:34 The is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever read. People want to shift over to renewable sources to reduce global emissions, but we can't do it on our own! Big oil and gas are powerful. We have to fight for it. Suing is the right first step.
4041 2018-01-14 22:19:33 Exactly! Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Hawaii, California-wild fires & mud slides- but, hey...Mar A Largo is in FL, so no (more) off shore oil wells.

4090 2018-01-14 22:14:10 Street light that the old Benin Empire had in the 1700s and powered with palm oil. It still manages to be a big deal today.
4091 2018-01-14 22:14:09 1/Value of land by itself. Making sense of the land rush e.g in oil areas relative to agric use. The current value of land to GDP - If we isolate the location factor and use agric land rent as parameter to value land, then land to GDP contribution remains small. @HinduAshaUG
4092 2018-01-14 22:14:04 just vegetable oil. I read that avocado oil doesn't smoke up as easy so I might get some of that
4093 2018-01-14 22:13:55 It's like this Diane, wind power and solar just isn't going to be enough, coal and oil are running out so the turtle treadmill may be mankind's last hope.

4144 2018-01-14 22:05:00 Here’s a big  jokes-on-you, to all the states that fought tooth-and-nail to not have wind turbines off of your coasts. You were instead advocating for oil rigs. Think about what and who you are suppporting for and against next time, bitches.
4145 2018-01-14 22:04:49 In the past it had seasons in a butter/oil that had to be shook to stir up them contents for a perfect blend to dip your crust in. For lack of a better explanation!

4161 2018-01-14 22:01:46 Our government say they will not be drilling for oil in Lofoten, Vesterålen, Senja, Jan Mayen, ice edge, Skagerak and Mørefeltene :)
4162 2018-01-14 22:01:14 Definitely, I prefer Mediterranean styles. Catch it, grill it, drizzle with olive oil, fresh herbs - then eat! Fresh water fish, pan fry in butter +sage - then eat. Met a kiwi couple in Greece who wouldn't eat the grilled fresh sardines bcos = bait! Sigh
4163 2018-01-14 22:01:08 hot oil treatment! or wash your hair with beer! both are things I do 
beer helps repair damage and the hot oil treatment softens and moisturizes
4164 2018-01-14 22:01:02 I'd rather have soft towels with oil than have a towel rip off the top layer of my flesh.

4172 2018-01-14 22:00:27 I put peppermint, lavender, oregano and a pinch of grapefruit oil in my diffuser. I feel super relaxed and my nasal passage is clear as fuggg
4173 2018-01-14 22:00:07 January 14, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4174 2018-01-14 22:00:02 there isn't any meaning full OIL off Florida
4175 2018-01-14 21:59:55 Try doing coil cleaning NYC on all the inefficient HVACR units you own rather than suing big oil.

4177 2018-01-14 21:59:42 Same reason they attacked cooking with tropical oil.... to sell more product; despite fact that their products cause more health damage than most seem to understand.
4178 2018-01-14 21:59:25 Alberta first introduced carbon pricing in 2007. Why? Largely because it seemed likely feds would regulate oil sands and coal GHGs through their Regulatory Framework for Air Emissions. #ableg #cdnpoli
4179 2018-01-14 21:59:11 you need an oil pen.
4180 2018-01-14 21:59:09 Not sure that the analogy of humans as oil wells is a good one. We’re not inert, we’ve will, based on consciousness which triggers our demand for fairness
4181 2018-01-14 21:58:27 Eei. Wonders. Oil drills all dey inside
4182 2018-01-14 21:58:15 Predicting oil is like predicting a pinball machine. But on solar and wind almost every serious organisation has predicted better. Unfortunately governments take their predictions-that-are-not-predictions (I've never heard what they ARE) seriously.
4183 2018-01-14 21:58:14 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
4184 2018-01-14 21:58:04 city are a team built on oil money, without the shiekh  where do you think city would be in the championship. so when you say its about money you are right but not just for united.
4185 2018-01-14 21:58:03 Oh dear I bought pomegranate noir bath oil for my step mother for Xmasdoes that mean it's too manly
4186 2018-01-14 21:58:00 Just say here, summer and winter oil smell burnt gas, and the rest is their business.
4187 2018-01-14 21:57:59 Only Republican Governors need apply. Local control, not when it comes to my oil & gas compatriots.
4188 2018-01-14 21:57:58 They will switch to the US Dollar soon. Like Zimbabwe did. Which will lead to an increase of exports for the US and a Trade in Oil between us. barrel for barrel. Which will Hurt OPEC as VE will have to increase production to fit the US need
4189 2018-01-14 21:57:53 I helllaaaa burnt myself with oil at work and my coworker put mustard on it lmaoooooooooo
4190 2018-01-14 21:57:26 All my condolences to the mourning families and survivors of the #Sanchi oil tanker's crew...may Allah grant peace to their grieving hearts.
4191 2018-01-14 21:57:22 oil myself up and pray to the 7 deities!
4192 2018-01-14 21:57:10 Mine costs about that much bc it’s full synthetic oil
4193 2018-01-14 21:57:08 No pizza company would do this. But if pizza boxes had perforated lines on them it would make good compost. It isn't easy to get all the food off the boxes and there is always oil on them too.
4194 2018-01-14 21:57:06 Never paid for a oil change, shit is high 
4195 2018-01-14 21:57:06 ‘...drown you in the oil ima cook my tinde in’  This is why I love you 
4196 2018-01-14 21:56:49 Fabric softener is a type of oil. It works by leaving a thin layer on clothes. That’s why it’s advertised as “last six months of you don’t wear your stuff”

Makes towels less absorbent overtime to the point that you might as well while off with TP.
4197 2018-01-14 21:56:08 I agree. Soros,Murdoch, and the rest of them are all monsters but still not pulling the strings. Clinton and Obama both had vested interests in GS. Trump owns a good amount of stock in them.
I mean the guy brought in Tillerson. Nothing says corrupt like banks and oil.
4198 2018-01-14 21:55:42 Fucking Andrew put power steering fluid in the weed eater cause he thought it was oil....

4202 2018-01-14 21:54:44 The anointing of the Monarch with holy oil is the most profoundly sacred moment in the coronation. It is a deeply profound, transformational moment in the life of all monarchs. Those who refer to this moment with profanity commit the most severe blasphemy.

Dubaicoin (DBIX) has had amazing growth and could capture a large portion of the Middle east’s cryptocurrency market. Oil money!!
4208 2018-01-14 21:53:56 @greenscentsuk Are you palm oil free? Thanks!
4209 2018-01-14 21:53:42 Often recommended is peppermint oil which is a natural solution that supposedly repels mice with its strong scent. Mice have extremely sensitive noses, so any smell they don’t like hits them much harder
4210 2018-01-14 21:53:42 Don't know what to order? Choose from our chef's recommendations! Right now, they recommend Hamachi Jalapeno with citrus ponzu as well as Salmon Nashi with Asian pear and truffle oil. Delicious and unique!

4212 2018-01-14 21:52:47 @HHShkMohd @ajmubasher @UN @KingSalman my question is why all of the middle east battles again. You have forgotten Allah's path. In a blind systematic problem of middle eastern oil on a demise you blame each other. I recommend building a manufacturing, and retail economy.
4213 2018-01-14 21:52:42 I add a tiny tiny drop of skincare oil when I use oil based foundation and it helps not to look flaky. 
4214 2018-01-14 21:52:33 And when it's not windy (often) it's back to all the essential means of generation (oil, gas, nuclear) they don't like.
4215 2018-01-14 21:52:24 Have you ever cooked with thc oil? Or prefer edibles?
4216 2018-01-14 21:52:24 Coconut oil , jobjoba oil , castor oil , olive oil

4219 2018-01-14 21:52:20 C''mon common sense , big oil is dictating the climate change denial narrative. They have more money then god so to say "corporations" are pushing climate is just nonsensical. Science doesn't have Trillions behind it , climate denial does.
4220 2018-01-14 21:51:59 Bruh she need motor oil for that shit bitches look like gator loafers

4224 2018-01-14 21:51:34 But look at the state of it. Is she really in a position to talk about black people being ugly?
She’s no oil painting and I can look at her and see she’ll age like a ripe banana
4225 2018-01-14 21:51:27 my region is really mixed, its north so generally poor but there are pockets of wealth where the good jobs are. Many ppl move to London. I went to uni in an oil city and it was stupid there, the poorest and richest ppl in all of Scotland mixed together, I didn't like that.
4226 2018-01-14 21:51:21 Tea tree oil and good moisturizer changed my lifeeee! Seriously made such a huge difference and way more affordable than buying a bunch of expensive face wash 
4227 2018-01-14 21:50:59 Interesting. No doubt big oil is a major player. But Manhattan has over 800 linear KMs of streets that still primarily cater to the car. We’re all complicit in climate change.

4230 2018-01-14 21:50:26 Put baby oil on my lips because they were dry now my tongue and lips have swollen... nice one charlotte
4231 2018-01-14 21:50:19 Or another nice way is, 125g salmon fillet in tinfoil, dressed with a little soy, sesame oil, ginger cut into matchsticks, garlic finely chopped, matchstick carrots,sliced red pepper celery, sliced spring onion, red chilli salt pepper and lime juice,12-16mins at 180. Foil wrapped
4232 2018-01-14 21:49:51 They never said the age of oil was over. One pipeline company trumped the other and the other can't afford both KXL and EE, hence putting its chips on KXL.
4233 2018-01-14 21:49:44 listen if it wasnt for your oil billionaires you would still be in utd"s shadow! 
4234 2018-01-14 21:49:44 , seriously, my grandmother used to make a chocolate cake with mayonnaise when she didn’t have eggs and oil due to rationing
4235 2018-01-14 21:49:25 I don't think it's even that much. I didn't say I was bathing in coconut oil --although that thought is now something I'm entertaining -- so it's not that much for my face. Rude. I thought we were trying to collectively help the others #Melanin flourish
4236 2018-01-14 21:49:07 Oklahoma is run by republicans and ranks third lowest in education and forth lowest in healthcare.  Intelligent educated professionals leave for better pay and better benefits. Rich in oil and gas but average pay is under 25,000 per person per year. Not very progressive state.
4237 2018-01-14 21:49:03 Islamists terrorize the world but EU & UK demand capitulation of #Israel just because Muslims used to West prostituting for their oil & money; many ignore history of Jesus, a Jewish reformist, who practiced Judaism in Jerusalem the capital of the ancient Judea- hence the name Jew
4238 2018-01-14 21:49:02 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
4239 2018-01-14 21:48:58 Ever try cooking rice in coconut oil? So good.
4240 2018-01-14 21:48:52 Stupid: tax scam; gutting Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid; oil drilling on every coast but Florida; Puerto Rico still has no electricity, PR never received funds Congress them; no affordable health insurance; reversing laws that protected the people and the country; etc
4241 2018-01-14 21:48:32 To keep oil prices high, both Republicans and Russians want to insure dependency on fossil fuel, and both prefer oligarchic control of government to democracy.
4242 2018-01-14 21:48:30 Thats not somalis problems now, we need laws, rights and freedom. Somalia is lawless and corrupt, oil will do nothing until its stable and free.

4246 2018-01-14 21:48:15 They could be revoking Chevron’s conditional use permits to drill for oil in the city of Los Angeles!! #climatechange #environmentalhealth
4247 2018-01-14 21:48:12 Given how much the price of oil has gone up, how is that going to happen?
4248 2018-01-14 21:48:07 Gingko did zero for me.

Key to fish oil is to take it in liquid form. There's something about the process for mfg into a pill that corrupts the benefits you're trying to get.

THE SOLUTION: healthy nutrition plan of good fats, complex carbs, healthy proteins + 30 mins/day cardio
4249 2018-01-14 21:48:03 Gotta get you some avacado oil
4250 2018-01-14 21:48:01 Tea Tree oil is fixing all my life problems
4251 2018-01-14 21:47:53 It hasn’t worked for me. Plus, use ground non-gmo flaxseed instead of fish oil. Fish oil in stores is likely rancid. Flaxseed needs to be ground when you use it. Green tea also helps. I like Inca tea black tea for brain fog. Google it. Exercise and sleep help most.
4252 2018-01-14 21:47:52 I want and oil diffuser
4253 2018-01-14 21:47:37 Flake, the detestable Snake Oil Salesman.
4254 2018-01-14 21:47:36 I got told to go with extra virgin olive oil
4255 2018-01-14 21:47:26 Or roughly 1/10000000000000 of what oil companies cost tax payers annually.
4256 2018-01-14 21:47:10 Enbridge and Trans Canada were both ready to spend billions to build NG and EE, so it made economic sense. And contrary to the pronouncements of Gerald Butts and others, the age of oil if far from over. Demand is China alone grows by more than 1 million barrels a day, each year.
4257 2018-01-14 21:46:52 Shows how far a foreign dictators oil money has gone 
4258 2018-01-14 21:46:50 Of course it will. The UK will be fucked when Scottish oil has to be taken off the balance sheet after Independence. Even the morons at the ratings agencies aren't going to triple-A that.
4259 2018-01-14 21:46:43 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.

4265 2018-01-14 21:46:16 It's prolly another ship that was sunk to make a reef.  So, no money for selling it.  Just like how they sell old aircraft carriers for $1, company turns it into an oil tanker, then sells it for over $1 billion.  Too much lost with government not selling for more money.

4272 2018-01-14 21:45:49 trump eliminated regulations for coal and oil companies.  No longer safety regs protecting the workers.  In case anyone forgot, 18 workers died on Deep Water before those regs were put in place.  trump LOVES shareholders - not people.
4273 2018-01-14 21:45:48 Yes sugar burn makes a lot of sense! Just bake it with a drizzle of olive oil like normal, have sweet potato instead of regular as supposedly healthier, seems more sugar tho so maybe not!

4296 2018-01-14 21:42:36 And yes, I would rather see the government play god, because our government is supposed to be of, by, & for the people, & not a just a few of them.

4304 2018-01-14 21:41:13 I wish The B Team would realize the environmental & economic benefits of utilizing industrial hemp. Our oceans and landfills would not be as polluted with plastic if we had invested in hemp instead of oil. Hemp facts are astounding. Educate, innovate, build utilizing hemp.

4307 2018-01-14 21:40:44 Also the ill-advised double use of the word "patties." To say nothing of the "O these golden sticks of tuber magically transmogrified by infernal oil!" part.
4308 2018-01-14 21:40:44 Just completed changing the motor oil and filters, air filters, and rotating all the tires in both of our cars.

4317 2018-01-14 21:38:11 The Russian oligarchy, fueled by the oil trade and organized crime, has partnered with American industrialists and plutocrats to overthrow the United States of America and institute a new state-less corporate fascism. We are at war.
4318 2018-01-14 21:38:00 My car desperately needed an oil change 
4319 2018-01-14 21:37:45 bakit sa buong buhay ko ngayon lang walang extra stock ng oil puta i want to cook hash brown pa naman i’m hungry as fck simula pa nung midnight ): ang sad
4320 2018-01-14 21:37:38 I certainly did, until I saw some copy on a bottle of lime oil in a shop yesterday, and it said "imagine there are 80 limes in here!"
4321 2018-01-14 21:37:29 Got sent to buy hummus, but there’s been some kind of run on it. They only had extra virgin olive oil hummus, kale and pumpkin seed hummus, caramelised onion hummus, piri piri hummus, Moroccan topped hummus and red pepper hummus left. None of those were the hummus I was sent for.
4322 2018-01-14 21:37:25 It’s clear you have been bought by Oil and Gas @SecretaryZinke. Why don’t you do the country a favor and self immolate?
4323 2018-01-14 21:37:10 #OIL $MXC $GBR  Long Add U.S. crude supplies have fallen for eight weeks in a row, for a total drop of more than 39 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration. That marks the “biggest drop in history in the shortest amount of time,”

4325 2018-01-14 21:36:40 Vegetarians don't eat meat or meat which is fine, how many people protest PKE but consume palm oil products, most I would suspect. Soaps, lots and lots of foods (inc vegan approved), chocolate spreads, (in fact most spreads) the list goes on and on. Focus there.
4326 2018-01-14 21:36:38 yet scotland the only part of the uk without trade deficit , oh wait itll be the burden of north sea oil , whisky and food exports etc. gotcha.

4328 2018-01-14 21:36:35 They refigured two refineries to accept heavy oil, and there's little capacity to refine bitumen east of Lloydminster. Companies aren't lining up to spend several billion on a coker unit.
4329 2018-01-14 21:36:04 I sometimes cry when I'm constipated and threaten myself to drink Castor oil so what am I gonna do with an entire dick in my Ass? Nooh ke bitsa maponesa yong.

4334 2018-01-14 21:35:22 jews hold some disproportianate positions of power in finance entertainment and history but islamic money through oil now has so much influence through investment in mosques ,media , education and the u.n. israel gets hysterical criticism.
4335 2018-01-14 21:35:16 Bottom line - Canada needs the US a lot more than the US needs Canada.  They are falling off a demographic cliff. And, living off nasty Alberta Tar sands while US has white chicken oil from Permian Basis! Canada gets fracked,
4336 2018-01-14 21:35:15 Oil Money 
4337 2018-01-14 21:35:03 An interesting way to privatize their oil and sell it at very cheap free market prices.... Good luck with that!
4338 2018-01-14 21:35:03 Someone on my Facebook just said oil pulling with coconut oil is, and I quote “dumb as fuck... do not play with your teeth.” ... and then proceeded to suggest using baking soda to whiten teeth 
4339 2018-01-14 21:35:01 Like I said, u would but snake oil thinking it was the slider if life if Trump said so.

4345 2018-01-14 21:34:14 Yes I do have a car, a Ford Mustang ...an American made car, what about you? And guess what? that oil spill and the clean up will increase the price of gas.
4346 2018-01-14 21:33:54 Blaming Trudeau is asinine. We have to sell to US because we don't have the refinery capability. So we can't just send bitumen to the east as it has to be refined. I doubt oil will ever go back to its glory days of $120/bbl.
4347 2018-01-14 21:33:50 Heavy salt, pepper, olive oil, roast em for a while until the outsides are a lil burnt and muah. Delicious.

4350 2018-01-14 21:33:35 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4351 2018-01-14 21:33:35 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.

4356 2018-01-14 21:33:22 Coconut oil is magical for sunburn
4357 2018-01-14 21:33:16 I could use summertime, a bikini, the river, sunglasses, Hawaiian tropic tanning oil, beer and crawfish.
4358 2018-01-14 21:33:04 Remember that oil needs to be refreshened on a regular basis so that we can keep moving. Old oil can evaporate away. Old oil can leak from your engine 
Old oil  is dense and not usable. Old oil also smells bad!  We need a regular oil change. So seek God for that fresh anointing!
4359 2018-01-14 21:32:32 I made my own toothpaste today, coconut oil, activated charcoal, Turmeric, bentonite clay and a couple drops of peppermint oil

4368 2018-01-14 21:30:49 Bush went after Saddam and Obama went after Gaddafi because both wanted oil sales conducted in gold, rather than U.S. dollars. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve cannot afford to allow a free market. They want to control everything.
4369 2018-01-14 21:30:32 NZ is a small island with v small population that diversified into other areas like cheese, wine, olive oil. It now holds the live meat market for Saudi & some other ME countries. Canada has vast oil & mineral wealth. That’s history.

4390 2018-01-14 21:26:48 Yes. The federal and state governments in addition to land mineral rights owners make billions of dollars in oil production and leases. Where will that money come from with other forms of energy. USA became great in the Industrial Age because of its riches in minerals.

4398 2018-01-14 21:26:08 @ImpossibleFoods Hi, had your burger at Founding Farmers and it was amazing. Would you consider switching the coconut oil to canola or olive oil, given that the latest research on coconut oil shows its high saturated fat content increases cholesterol?

4411 2018-01-14 21:24:59 Would 100% recommend the Nigel Slater method - cut in half lengthways, score and rub with oil, oregano and chilli. Stick in the oven at 180 until soft. Great served with basic tomato sauce /polenta/pasta.
4412 2018-01-14 21:24:58 And yet, that garbage wouldn't pollute the land for hundreds of years like oil does. It ruins land for generations.

4415 2018-01-14 21:24:24 six eggs! Divide 4 of them and the other two put them full! Add lots of parmesan, must be dense! Cook bacon with oil and while it's sizzling add it to the sauce together with the pasta, that's what cooks it! Now you've got the perfect carbonara!
4416 2018-01-14 21:24:01 So kill him and his ideas or tie him up and discourage him big oil will love you and then you and your children die just like the rest of us. Good logic ?

4469 2018-01-14 21:17:38 The video of that girl going through the front of her glass stove after she hits the vegetable oil mid sprint is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen on the Internet.
4470 2018-01-14 21:17:18 This is the President and Secretary of State in the U One deal that sent  free energy material to Russia that now wants to sell oil to Trump. WOW  You see how Nikola Tesla free energy gets dealt Big Time.
4471 2018-01-14 21:17:14 Then why is oil per barrel the highest it’s been in years???
4472 2018-01-14 21:16:52 I’ve been really getting into Tom Waits lately, and I’m trying to figure out how he went from sounding like a regular folk singer on Closing Time to sounding like he swallowed razors and motor oil on Swordfishtrombones (which sounds awesome btw).
My theory is A LOT of cigarettes.

4475 2018-01-14 21:16:29 So, we don't drill offshore, but Mexico does and then we buy the oil from Mexico!  Idiots.

4478 2018-01-14 21:16:24 This is the President and Secretary of State in the U One deal that sent free energy material to Russia that now wants to sell oil to Trump. WOW You see how Nikola Tesla free energy gets dealt Big Time.

4486 2018-01-14 21:14:50 @MilesBJordan another book suggestion 

The Way Forward is With a Broken Heart by Alice Walker 

The short story “Olive Oil” is my fave.
4487 2018-01-14 21:14:44 Hope there won’t be an off shore oil rig in that picture now that Trump wants to drill everywhere but near mar a lago
4488 2018-01-14 21:14:17 Oooh je savais pas du tout merci beaucoup pour l'info !! J'avais juste lu "oil" et je pensais que c'était ça du coup ;; (Je connais pas encore bien les filles, je suis contente si je peux en apprendre un peu sur elles )
4489 2018-01-14 21:14:11 Also about city - the campaign to unsettle him has been long and relentless, but even though they have limitless cash they’re now going to pass it up, oil money yobs
4490 2018-01-14 21:14:05 Put oil
4491 2018-01-14 21:14:03 Too lazy to change my own oil this time around... so I resorted to Walmart... I hate Walmart
4492 2018-01-14 21:14:02 Not trying to start shit but I believe the argument about city spending so much money is cuz it's "oil money" while United spend "earned money" through fans and revenue
4493 2018-01-14 21:14:02 Time for all GOP to go! You haven't served Oklahomans. You're looking out for oil. Oklahomans are suffering. Get rid of right to fire. Hold corporate accountable. Lower middle-class taxes. Raise corporate. You have no real understanding of what Oklahomans need. #FlipOKBlue2018
4494 2018-01-14 21:14:01 How mature......u started it lol. George W got us into a war based on false info. He killed Americans, wasted taxpayer trillions because of foreign oil and greed. Also allowed the sub prime mortgage nightmare to hurt the economy

4497 2018-01-14 21:13:39 You sir are a desensitized idiot. Who thinks it’s okay to call black men sons of bitches? I’m not a bitch and I’m proud of my sons. Who calls African countries shitholes? When oil, diamonds, platinum & other minerals come from there. Where people are more educated than most Amcns
4498 2018-01-14 21:13:32 Yes use any tool 2 get their oil. Guess they probably used religion 2 keep the sheep in line. Religion definitely becomes the "opiate of the masses." The right now want 2 create Armageddon so Trump can be their saviour white supremacist knight in shining armor! More like !
4499 2018-01-14 21:13:23 Actually the student takes it in oil pill form @Complex
4500 2018-01-14 21:13:15 ‘Citeh’ Andrew! Really. 
Come on, stick oil money and Emptyhad in for good measure and you’ll have a full house!!
Best team won. Not great news for you boys though.
4501 2018-01-14 21:13:14 Classy.  Jim's made up booby prizes in the early episodes were great too.  "So sorry it's a British Rail pork pie", "Dear dear it's a glass of castor oil and some running shoes" and "sorry about that it's last year's cup final tickets.".

4506 2018-01-14 21:12:37 I was in Boots today and someone threw a bottle of Omega 3 capsules at me.

Thankfully, my injuries were only super fish oil.
4507 2018-01-14 21:12:12 A church that preaches poverty as holiness is as demonic as the one that preaches wealth as the whole Gospel.
4508 2018-01-14 21:12:07 Wrong, toddler. Mr. Obama halted work on the pipeline in Sept 2016 and Trump restarted it in Jan 2017. The oil spill was in November of 2017.
4509 2018-01-14 21:12:04 I wonder if they also own patents on the 300$ oil change 
4510 2018-01-14 21:12:03 This old couple really wants me to talk them... normally I would but I'm tired I'm just tryna get my oil changed in peace 
4511 2018-01-14 21:12:01 And BTW Fracking is Natural Gas not oil.  That is why we are now the second or third largest exporter of LNG in the world. We are completely LNG independent and we didn’t have to go to Anwar to do it. Those people whose land is used are well compensated.
4512 2018-01-14 21:11:55 Did you know that the definition  of Christ is Anointed One?  And when you say that you are a Christian, that means I’m the Anointed One’s anointed one?  God wants to anoint us with fresh oil so we can be refreshed & have power to walk right, talk right & even bless our enemies!
4513 2018-01-14 21:11:50 Why is there even a single PSU in India? PSUs are just a waste of taxpayers money. This includes oil companies. Govt has no business being in any business.
4514 2018-01-14 21:11:46 The Jetta I owned years ago was a piece of crap that burned oil the day I drove it off the lot... So yeah... maybe...
4515 2018-01-14 21:11:45 This is all because Obama and Hillary destroyed Libya to take their resources. But just like the Bushes before them, killing over one million Iraqi children was worth the oil and gov contracts to rebuild, as stated by secretary Albright!
4516 2018-01-14 21:11:19 Two pieces of fruit a day is normally enough.  If you eat more, take into consideration the size of the fruit.  As for industrial oils, I use Olive Oil very sparingly, but instead use butter for my steak and vegetables.
4517 2018-01-14 21:11:15 i use coconut oil religiously
4518 2018-01-14 21:11:05 Niggas be having naturally wavy hair posting They waves.. that’s SUPPOSE to happen regardless if u brush use oil anything.. lemme see u get it out the mud & then I might say heem swimming

4520 2018-01-14 21:11:03 There needs to be a example made out of this company and its country for destroying more of the ocean. how many more oil accidents will Ruin the ocean to the point of no return? The oceans are already being the threaten on different levels by man's continued ignorance.
4521 2018-01-14 21:11:01 thanks to oil
4522 2018-01-14 21:10:58 How could you blame China while Iranian authorities were busy counting bills from sold oil and did nothing? This is the result of putting low-paid, inexperienced and unqualified crews in charge of supertankers in congested waterways, btw! And I'm not Chinese!
4523 2018-01-14 21:10:48 Soaking my hair in coconut oil. I swear I use this shit for everything.

4529 2018-01-14 21:10:13 Shale is the main factor as it takes the biggest importer (USA)of oil on the planet & turns it into a self sufficient exporter... shale producers have shown $35 a bbl is @ where they are profitable. Shale is in its infancy. Abundant clean and cheap. I am hoping @ $50 long term
4530 2018-01-14 21:09:52 I threaten you with Buddhist hell!

I'm sure your like me and think "meh"

4535 2018-01-14 21:09:32 This game is stressing me out so much that I’ve done a mud mask, a deep cleanse, used rose oil and spray myself with rose coconut mist

4541 2018-01-14 21:09:06 Who cares, we need more oil! Stop relying on Middle Eastern countries.
4542 2018-01-14 21:08:56 They need a new box for that oil #TheCoronation
4543 2018-01-14 21:08:56 I take flax seed oil.
4544 2018-01-14 21:08:55 And the olive oil shuffle was superb.
4545 2018-01-14 21:08:46 Not sure anyone from any party has ever knocked on our door. 

It may be the moat & buckets of hot oil that deters them.
4546 2018-01-14 21:08:24 Jamaica, Dominican Republic - tourist spots that care about their image. None have oil though. Arabs do well then!
4547 2018-01-14 21:08:20 However, T&D costs can still go up even if generation cost is capped. But this just makes distributed solar and battery storage more competitive with utility power. So utility pricing is quite hemmed in, while oil could go off the rails.
4548 2018-01-14 21:08:03 God allows those things to happen because He wants us to learn more about life.

God allows us to be crushed like olives (best oil), to be squeeze like grapes (best wine), and pressd like roses (best perfume) in order to bring out the best in us. . .

have faith in GOD. . .

4558 2018-01-14 21:06:43 Oklahomans deserve better than this. This state has suffered under republicans for 10yrs. Time for change! Lowest in education, highest in teen pregnancy, lowest wages, fracking, catering to big oil...the list is long. #VoteBlue2018
4559 2018-01-14 21:06:35 Right either too expensive for the powerful models needed sometimes and or not readily available to regular public.

Crude Oil ist Rohöl, also ist das Wort Leichtöl eine Verharmlosung + dass brauchen wir Bürger nicht
4562 2018-01-14 21:05:55 Norway haven’t joined the EU as a full member, simply because they don’t want to share the money raised by the oil they currently have!

4566 2018-01-14 21:05:20 ... yeah, but we've got bombs, fighter jets, and oil pipelines to build. Clearly that's more important than ensuring that Americans have access to clean water.

4574 2018-01-14 21:04:06 Is is possible for electricity to become more expensive than gasoline? Not really, because oil would be used for generation if it were cheaper. Moreover, wind and solar are increasingly putting price cap on coal and natural gas.

4586 2018-01-14 21:01:21 Oil, coal, gas will ALWAYS be lower cost than solar....why not put more research in nuclear technologies????
4587 2018-01-14 21:01:17 The hype dimension. Currently high on fish oil.
4588 2018-01-14 21:00:52 I think that some multinational corporations behind Bill Gates decided to redistribute oil and other resources of Nigeria in their hands.
4589 2018-01-14 21:00:50 Are the commercials banking on a "surprise" rate hike to save the day I wonder. Also wonder if #gold is being bought in advance of the chineese oil benchmark, hmm. Sell the news next week?

2- روسيا وعلي لسان سفيرها السابق في المملكه يقول ضيعوا الفرص في الثمانينات وذلك لعدم تعاونهم مع اوبك وبالخصوص المملكه بخصوص انهيار الاسعار حيث كان بالامكان الحد من الانتاج ورفع الاسعار؟ 
تعليقك يادكتور مهم للفايده وشكرا
4598 2018-01-14 20:59:34 Turkey is preparing an offensive on the Syrian Kurdish Canton of Afrin -  does anybody care - or is it solely up to those who saved Kobane - rescued people from Shingal mountain - and who defeated Isis in Raqqa - while the rest of the world will make money on weapons and oil ..?

NYC is the first big city in America to sue and divest from Big Oil. #stopfundingfossils
4601 2018-01-14 20:59:14 お仕事の時間ですwwwww
4602 2018-01-14 20:59:11 LOL ALSO - if we use BC, the artificial hormones can also have a major effect on our premenopausal state. GOOD evening primrose oil/teas can help alleviate some symptoms. If you are developping UBER sensitive skin (ITCHY), an antihistamine is your best friend
4603 2018-01-14 20:59:11 He’s was trying to sabotage Dinah since day one when they released two singles back to back with her not singing at all. They knew if the go heard the best singer then Castor Oil would be over
4604 2018-01-14 20:59:09 Was it in our national interest, for BIG OIL to drill, at the US NAVAL OIL RESERVE at TEAPOT DOME??
4605 2018-01-14 20:59:07 Lucky for Florida you aren't seeing an oil drilling platform.
4606 2018-01-14 20:58:59 We still have 2 goals outstanding. Na only Madrid get wetin fit fall us for that league this season but they need to oil their engines
4607 2018-01-14 20:58:55 @mitchellreports this am you brought up calif re: potus. I hope this week on your program that you would point this out & go further to state the new oil drilling is direct retaliation to the state of CA proven out by letting FL slide

4609 2018-01-14 20:58:50 But there are many cities around America working it and the world...Understanding it's a different source and you're valid in stating these renewable energy sources should be investing in our department of transportation and roadways upgrades As well as +powerful models available
4610 2018-01-14 20:58:41 The oven roasted turkey with a little bit of mayo, a little bit of oil, a little bit of vinegar, is good, I'm telling ya. I will admit that their quesadillas are disappointing.
4611 2018-01-14 20:58:37 This is a terrible tragedy that the global  community can avoid in the future by ending dependency on oil - which is silently killing the planet. Grieving for loss shouldn’t come w/out reflection on why the lives were lost in the first place. Shameful to not plan for future.
4612 2018-01-14 20:58:35 It is surely not unique in that is it? Sperm oil works too. Patrick O'Brian Wine Dark Sea?
4613 2018-01-14 20:58:20 tried opening a oil bottle, no luck, but now my hand feels on fire

4621 2018-01-14 20:57:19 That's serious poop coverage! I never knew about it after doing a series of classes and reading a few books. Or maybe I forgot! But we were advised to bring olive oil by our midwives - and wondered why - bingo. As long as you apply it - it's super easy to deal with and no stink!
4622 2018-01-14 20:57:12 Just washed the locs. Got the hot oil treatment going up. Feeling luxurious af
4623 2018-01-14 20:57:03 Which wine goes best with a cod-liver oil capsule?

4625 2018-01-14 20:56:53 That's just great! Like if the level of pollution isn't high enough in that part of the world. Disgusting. I pray this doesn't happen here in Vancouver. With the extremely high number of oil tankers in the Burrard inlet. Scary shit.
4626 2018-01-14 20:56:50 No evidence for that but a lot of evidence evil Muslim men destroying lives all over the World. Rich oil Arabs wont even help their own people. Sick people.
4627 2018-01-14 20:56:47 I had a productive ass day feet done oil change eye appointment for glasses now car wash and shopping all while watching the playoffs
4628 2018-01-14 20:56:46 Managed to get salty olive oil in my eye while eating oven roasted veggies. I have mad skills. Useless and painful, but still mad skills.

4635 2018-01-14 20:56:12 Nutella is not allowed . Thanks to the modified palm oil . Not good for your heart. Y'all can have almond hazelnut butter as a substitute. It's loaded with good fats and heart healthy . Carry on...
4636 2018-01-14 20:56:04 ‘Oil up’ loool
4637 2018-01-14 20:55:58 There are alternatives to oil, but no alternatives for coasts and oceans (or ANWR, or...).
4638 2018-01-14 20:55:53 I disagreed with Bakare. Pmb has done fairly well on security and anti corruption within 3yrs. Pmb has also grown the non oil sector.
4639 2018-01-14 20:55:50 alex eddy once told me, “Blake bortles and playoffs is like oil and water” he’s 2-0 son
4640 2018-01-14 20:55:41 The boys carefully cracked the eggs and dumped them into the bowl. Echo went ahead and poured some water and oil into the mix. Afterwards he handed the boys spatulas to stir.
"Babe can you preheat the oven?"
4641 2018-01-14 20:55:31 “my onion rings are greasy” ??? wtf you expect they get cooked in oil...
4642 2018-01-14 20:55:18 Go out there rep Oil City and Pennsylvania @koymonster bring that ring home!!!
4643 2018-01-14 20:55:01 Mmm, delicious. I'm eating cold pizza from Pizza Hut, and all the oil in the crust is deliciously crispy.
4644 2018-01-14 20:54:52 I was rejoicing bc it means for funds for investment in critical areas and my China n co talk was implying we still have time to make use of oil

4653 2018-01-14 20:54:04 Obama started bombing the oil trucks after Trump pointed that out during the campaign but not until then
4654 2018-01-14 20:54:04 City not pay the money.. 
Money is no option with the oil club.

4661 2018-01-14 20:53:10 The truth is that we need to move on from some players. Irrespective of the attachment the fans have with them. We also need to change manager. Let's face it, Arsene Wenger can no longer motivates these players to consistent success with all these Oil owners around.
4662 2018-01-14 20:53:07 Here is another one from this lying dirtbag &  oil salesman! Need to let lying Dick that Americanscomes first not law breaking illegals!
4663 2018-01-14 20:53:05 Nigeria has billions of dollars of annual oil revenue.  Fix corruption instead.  Solve the underlying problem, else nothing truly gets fixed.  See also the resource curse.
4664 2018-01-14 20:53:04 I've been thinking about it. She probably needs some to help with her joints. I've heard fish oil is Good!
4665 2018-01-14 20:52:55 Bortles deserves a lot of credit on these last two drives as the No. 1 ranked D is leaking oil everywhere.
4666 2018-01-14 20:52:50 What about baby oil???
4667 2018-01-14 20:52:44 Oil, granite and the biggest man made hole in Europe
4668 2018-01-14 20:52:43 2/ .....And what started this great economy Obamanites wants to take credit for??

Drilling on private property. Not on Federal property since Obama was a greenie & environmentalist. 

FRACKIN'.. FRACKIN'.. FRACKIN'..
4669 2018-01-14 20:52:29 I made stuffed bullet Chillies today with the same mix. Chickpea flour. Lemon juice. Salt. Cumin powder. Mix to paste with water and stuff into cavity of chilli. Fry in oil with mustard seeds like potstickers. I’d burn the base, flip, steam.
4670 2018-01-14 20:52:13 What the fuck Subway are you from, oil??? Vinegar????? What sorcery
4671 2018-01-14 20:52:12 Shit, u cool wit them oil spills tho??
4672 2018-01-14 20:52:02 The oil companies keep it a lot cleaner then your cities. Maybe some of those homeless are from one of the all American industries you've helped regulate to nothing and the oil industry is exactly what they need. It would help clean up our cities n more. 10birds1stone.
4673 2018-01-14 20:51:58 
4674 2018-01-14 20:51:52 jeez that's harsh, none of us oil paintings.
4675 2018-01-14 20:51:50 I cannot c me driving an electric car any time soon. They have there place in short haul, big city. It u want to drive across US forget it. Trying to get your electric car fixed in a small town would get u funny looks.  Electric cars do not fix roads. Gas cars u pay road tax
4676 2018-01-14 20:51:49 Well I just made a warm salad and dress it with oil so I guess this inspired me to eat healthier in a roundabout way.
4677 2018-01-14 20:51:33 a buddy of mine said he had a 'small' head gasket leak and when i pulled his coil pack out the fucking entire spark plug cylinder was full of oil
4678 2018-01-14 20:51:21 You're no oil painting hen.
4679 2018-01-14 20:51:21 Packing natural hair products is a whole new ordeal. I’m sitting around trying to consolidate leave in conditioner and stashing away coconut oil

4683 2018-01-14 20:51:05 Besides, we don't even need to use oil to diversify from oil. Rwanda is landlocked with no oil, but they are now light years ahead of us.
4684 2018-01-14 20:50:43 Yes, veggie meat substitutes taste like band-aids, salt, oil and smoke--but it's worth it to me to save the life of just one animal.

4687 2018-01-14 20:50:11 Fun fact for you tree huggers! Your cute little Prius still needs oil to lubricate bearings and all other kinds of cool spiny stuff.  not so “eco friendly” now is it? 
4688 2018-01-14 20:50:02 Queen was anointed wth oil to a 17th century recipe - perhaps CI who commissioned new oil. Certainly sounds similar ingredients
4689 2018-01-14 20:49:59 Bitches always wanna eat and always talkin about losing weight .. water and oil ass shit
4690 2018-01-14 20:49:58 Kennedy was a billionaire. Born into wealth & married into it. His father was one of the wealthiest men in America & the first chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. Jackie was an oil heiress. He was a great president who really did serve the people as I remember.
4691 2018-01-14 20:49:55 Oil that's about it and it's cheaper to have the troops and equipment there before the war breaks out again
4692 2018-01-14 20:49:35 “Retail mentoring”. I only know because I saw a tweet from @grassrootsbake & I looked at the conversation with him. I can’t because I’m blocked. I hope it’s an accident, otherwise it looks 100% huffy

4695 2018-01-14 20:49:24 Wouldn’t eggman go in the lawful evil slot? He’s basically just an oil tycoon and all of his minions are basically hive mind which doesn’t allow for any chaos, like he has laws and abides them a chaotic character wouldn’t have laws they follow
4696 2018-01-14 20:49:06 Somebody said they won't only miss heaven but their own hell will be burning with engine oil added.

4707 2018-01-14 20:47:58 Any grown man in this day & age who refers to their significant other female partner as “The Woman” should be boiled in oil & sold as soap.
4708 2018-01-14 20:47:38 I noticed the coronation oil made by a dispensing chemist in 1952.  Don't remember Mrs moody teaching us that extemp.  Hope someone has the worksheet.
4709 2018-01-14 20:47:33 One of the best things about chrism, the oil that is used to anoint a king or queen, is that if you drop it into a raging sea, it will immediately calm the violence of the waves. Demons shrink from it as well.
4710 2018-01-14 20:47:27 Another major oil disaster
4711 2018-01-14 20:47:19 That’s my girl!!!! . I am grilling thighs also. Little oil, little lemon. Good to go
4712 2018-01-14 20:47:15 The recipe for the Coronation anointing oil just being handwritten,folded up and bunged in a box like my grandma’s recipe for rum and raisin fudge

4718 2018-01-14 20:46:46 Mary. Those energy sources u mention are not proven for high energy yield. Natural gas fired plants, coal, oil, Nuclear produces a tremulous amount of energy of what this country needs. As far as cars, the internal combustion engine is efficient proven tech. Over 200 years.
4719 2018-01-14 20:46:29 LMAO! Coconut Oil Mami! Lol Nada Fat Papi Que Pasa?!
4720 2018-01-14 20:46:23 Delighted at the big focus on the anointing oil on this #coronation  programme as it's something to which I always refer when I anoint a child at baptism (shamelessly nicked from @frsimon)
4721 2018-01-14 20:46:21 Anointing- The Queen is anointed with Holy Oil, and is consecrated to her high office. An intimate moment, not broadcast on TV.
Crowning- HM is presented w/ orb, sceptre & crowned by Archbishop. (Orb=Power of a Christian Prince. Sceptre- Temporal Power) #TheCoronation
4722 2018-01-14 20:46:18 why did our oil change cost 75 fucking dollars
4723 2018-01-14 20:46:06 Someone will surely copy that oil recipe and sell it on Etsy. #YoureWelcome #TheCoronation
4724 2018-01-14 20:46:06 New York Mayor Bill De Blasio Tried Suing Oil Companies Over Global Warming, Now He's Getting Roasted. And now he's getting roasted.
4725 2018-01-14 20:46:04 That’s a result of the proximity and quantity of oil refineries in NJ, reducing transport costs.  But you’re right, the gov saw a place where he could soak the state’s tax beleaguered citizens for yet more revenue, and stuck his blood funnel in it.
4726 2018-01-14 20:46:03 Anyone get that? We can all knock up some Anointing Oil. #TheCoronation
4727 2018-01-14 20:46:02 I’m at work as we speak and this dude came in and ordered a footlong herbs and cheese bread with JUST OIL AND VINEGAR ON IT NO MEAT NO CHEESE NO VEGETABLES. I’m suicidal because of you now....

4729 2018-01-14 20:45:54 skincare instagram just suggested I put rubbing alcohol on my face and then coconut oil after. y’all really want me to break out huh
4730 2018-01-14 20:45:52 @MassGovernor @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren The reason why I oppose oil drilling off New England shores.
4731 2018-01-14 20:45:45 COCONUT OIL
4732 2018-01-14 20:45:45 Hope Twitter are taking down the recipe for this Coronation Oil. #TheCoronation
4733 2018-01-14 20:45:36 #thecoronation There is a recipe for the annointing oil!
4734 2018-01-14 20:45:36 Sniggering at the complex #coronation oil.... John Lewis probably do something similar at Christmas now.
4735 2018-01-14 20:45:15 Think you need a new box for that oil #TheCoronation
4736 2018-01-14 20:45:12 
4737 2018-01-14 20:45:07 Fun fact: Coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world, right behind oil. #coffee #CoffeeLover
4738 2018-01-14 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4739 2018-01-14 20:45:04 I also need to get myself a bottle of beard oil from @ItsAll_ByDesign . 
#Grooming
4740 2018-01-14 20:45:04 You missed my point, which was we should use oil to diversify from oil @Ifeyinwanene
4741 2018-01-14 20:44:43 Chili oil on everything 
4742 2018-01-14 20:44:37 I just imagined your avi with a bunch of oil derricks off the coast 
4743 2018-01-14 20:44:32 Eat em raw or salted and preserved in mustard oil where my fam are from. Some people add to dal, others stuff and bake, many candy them to preserve. Would make a great bitters I reckon.
4744 2018-01-14 20:44:03 That's the big problem right now.'
He puts the oil in and it just keeps shooting out the tailpipe...
No appetite. Everything hurts.
4745 2018-01-14 20:44:01 You shud be the manager , save all that oil money
4746 2018-01-14 20:43:54 Anointing oil, from god, to a monarch, on a golden spoon. Seems legit.
4747 2018-01-14 20:43:54 Literally just massage the oil over face with water and make up kind of melts away. Then follow with a cleanser
4748 2018-01-14 20:43:47 بتحصل
4749 2018-01-14 20:43:37 the secret to pan frying chicken is to put a lid over top of it so you're frying and pressure cooking it with minimal oil in the pan. it tastes perfect. never too overdone.
4750 2018-01-14 20:43:12 Or witch hazel ? Then vitamin e oil for dark spots right ?
4751 2018-01-14 20:43:10 It was weird, same oil/wax you use or something
4752 2018-01-14 20:43:06 #lithium is going to become the new oil, because all e-cars will need it for their batteries.
4753 2018-01-14 20:43:04 Look Britain! You aren't worthy to see the moment when the magic oil makes this woman so much better than you! KNOW YOUR PLACE!  #TheCoronation
4754 2018-01-14 20:43:02 @JBWolfsthal  Appreciated, but not applicable to Alaska. AK=no alerts=no panic. No legit alert system, because what could they do anyway  Plan=protect bases, pipeline, oil terminal.
4755 2018-01-14 20:42:40 So weird that folk wear dark tan then moan it takes years to come off n ur all scaly, medium always, moisturise every day with Vaseline cocoa butter (no oil in it), 1 week later exfoliate 2x in one day with st tropez removal mitt - bam it’s off  easy days
4756 2018-01-14 20:42:17 The Park Slope stoop lords have blessed me on this day, picked up a cute humidifier/essential oil diffuser 
4757 2018-01-14 20:42:13 Where does one buy holy oil and will it make me last as well as the Queen?  #Coronation
4758 2018-01-14 20:42:06 Oil patch is a brotherhood! Cheers
4759 2018-01-14 20:42:03 @BilldeBlasio But sue those oil companies. Twit.
4760 2018-01-14 20:42:00 People know you won the election. The only reason you’re pointing it out is because you need a distraction to herd you supporters. You’re a snake oil salesman. The media isn’t making things up, or focusing on things because you won. It’s because you’re an ass.
4761 2018-01-14 20:41:45 The gov that provides Europe with oil?  Just guessing
4762 2018-01-14 20:41:36 Waiting for the market to open so I can go long on oil,gold & copper.
4763 2018-01-14 20:41:34 Add the destruction of Canadian Coal and Canadian oil companies! United States profiting off of Canadian oil! China set to build 700 new coal fired plants around the globe and Canada one of the least pollution causing developed countries leads the charge into delusion
4764 2018-01-14 20:41:19 Oil at highest since March.
4765 2018-01-14 20:41:16 Fossil fuel is part of it... Like when it's used as FUEL... Not when it's turned into plastic... It's the emission that's hurting the climate. Not to mention you can make plastic from other sources then fossil oil.
4766 2018-01-14 20:41:08 @BrumHour Thanks for the RT to my oil painting so far  means a lot
4767 2018-01-14 20:41:07 Ooh what with? Was going to salt, dry and oil but happy to try something else!
4768 2018-01-14 20:41:06 sis i've been putting oil on myself every time i get out of the shower and it's the best thing ever
4769 2018-01-14 20:41:06 هههههههههههههههههه معرفش بقى 
4770 2018-01-14 20:40:46 This coconut oil lotion makes my skin so smooth  I love it
4771 2018-01-14 20:40:24 My eldest son of 27 developed seizures after accident and decided to try cannabis oil instead of seizure meds which left him zombie like. He rarely has seizures now and there's hope they will stop completely.
4772 2018-01-14 20:40:21 Lady in work put oil off the hob in a BOWL then didn't tell me she had it and she turned round and banged into me and it went all over my hand and side, luckily I was wearing a baggy top and got my hand under the water really fast
4773 2018-01-14 20:40:10 WOMEN!! help PLZ!! what is the most helpful thing for excruciating periods? i have a high pain tolerance, but my cramps are DEADLY. i use lavender oil, weed, motrin (although it's hard for me to keep medicine down). and id really like to stay away from the bc pill, HELP A GURL
4774 2018-01-14 20:40:09 Family Nutrition: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this January? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
4775 2018-01-14 20:40:09 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
4776 2018-01-14 20:39:53 @MajorPayne777 oil is pretty much a dollar bear trade at this point too... Get your story straight man! 
4777 2018-01-14 20:39:41 كل ده بسبب الاخوان يامحمود
4778 2018-01-14 20:39:26 2.65 a gallon for oil now?
Went up 40 cents since last time
40 cents adds up when ordering gallons of oil
Fucking A rabs
4779 2018-01-14 20:39:17 Diet and exercise mamacita , no dairy, lots of water and TEA TREE OIL 
4780 2018-01-14 20:39:13 Yall needa sleep on ur side!!!! Lavender oil or something!!! You damn rockers lol
4781 2018-01-14 20:39:09 Used a clove essential oil in my diffuser now my house smells like chai
4782 2018-01-14 20:38:47 New tags new bumper new windshield new headlight and a oil change ..... Shit killing my  pockets 
4783 2018-01-14 20:38:10 okay I got it. sugar scrub with an oil that cooperates with your facial skin and scalp, but just scrub the hairline u know? the sugar should be gentle enough to not cause problems, the oil will soften the outer skin layers, your hair gets moisturized?
4784 2018-01-14 20:37:50 I saw that in theaters after a hard leg day at the gym. The scene with the oil rig got me f'n pumped
Best SMan/DC film imo.
4785 2018-01-14 20:37:31 I'm getting promoted ads funded by oil/gas lambasting Bill DeBlasio for his divestment of and lawsuit against fossil fuel companies. Surely they can find a firm that helps them micro-target better
4786 2018-01-14 20:37:28 one taught me how to oil pull: whiter teeth .
4787 2018-01-14 20:37:27 مش هقولك مش احنا ال نبرر موقفنا هههههههههههههههههه
4788 2018-01-14 20:37:24 True for some but I think others were duped & are so invested in his Snake Oil that they can’t let go, even though it’s obvious he’s not bringing back the good times
4789 2018-01-14 20:37:03 Why did he insist on those who were to be blasted, be given a 30 minute warning?  Why did he never target the oil trucks making their way under Isis protection to Turkey?  Why did his strikes very rarely reduce Isis camps to rubble? Putin did a far better job.
4790 2018-01-14 20:36:57 Don’t make chips they are awful . Just sauté lightly with olive oil salt and pepper and garlic if you like it
4791 2018-01-14 20:36:55 CBD oil!!!
4792 2018-01-14 20:36:52 @eldervkbrown @themountleads Thank you for the oil handkerchief and ribbon!
4793 2018-01-14 20:36:46 get some black castor oil its cheap and supposed to do wonders
4794 2018-01-14 20:36:29 Rightttt and I put tea tree oil, olive oil, almond oil, and hella other stuff in it :) it was so expensive.
4795 2018-01-14 20:36:28 so like um i forgot to oil my scalp
4796 2018-01-14 20:36:22 I finally get my tires on my car changed, and the oil change light come on the next day
4797 2018-01-14 20:36:19 So I’m cooking chicken for my dinner. Not enough oil in pan & I set off the loud smoke alarms. Am flailing around wafting towels etc. My veggie fiancée slinks thru room, picks up her edemame & kale salad and purrs “your’s is done” as she leaves the room, didn’t miss a beat.
4798 2018-01-14 20:36:05 For the size of there country that's a lot of oil and a lot of money from oil
4799 2018-01-14 20:36:04 Also, stop feeding that thing natural oil...
4800 2018-01-14 20:35:57 Venezuela earned over 1 trillion dollars in the last 20 years from oil sales but still isn't the socialist utopia Chavez envisioned it to be
4801 2018-01-14 20:35:50 like a cleanser ? or oil ? or moisturizer lol ?
4802 2018-01-14 20:35:12 Finally, something that’s true; I am worried about letting my children down. I suspect it’s something most good dads have. Not something you’re familiar with I’m guessing. As for distance; I work on a ship, genius. Distance is inevitable seeing as I don’t choose where the oil is
4803 2018-01-14 20:34:57 With what? Oil change?
4804 2018-01-14 20:34:45 Ride safe out there. Not necessarily cold and icy. But roads been wet for days and no rain to wash oil and film away. Just had an off 5mph leaving a car park. #biker #bikerdown @LancsRoadPolice
4805 2018-01-14 20:34:19 Considering orange and lemon oil are extremely toxic to marine life I’d suggest not ;)
4806 2018-01-14 20:34:05 they did that to me with my coconut oil, I WAS THE BIG BOTTLE. i was so hurt and my hair 
4807 2018-01-14 20:33:51 I’m Bout To Grow This Beard Out For The  Next 11 Months - What’s A Good Beard Oil ?
4808 2018-01-14 20:33:44 i criticized him when he ran off for the golf course right after he spoke about a beheading and when he waited 3 days to speak on the oil spill and when he was ALWAYS golfing so what is your point?
4809 2018-01-14 20:33:41 Snake oil salesman.
4810 2018-01-14 20:33:38 Exactly.  My point if you saw he research u would understand how what corn OIL is used for and the $ it is making the farmers who ruin their fields and can’t grow anything else on that land now 80% of their farmlands are unable to produce anything but now their are other problem
4811 2018-01-14 20:33:37 nothing better than MorningStar buffalo chicken patties on a Cesar salad.
Baked 20 minuets w/olive oil.
4812 2018-01-14 20:33:28 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
4813 2018-01-14 20:33:19 The mining won't stop under President Trump & Zinke, they want to take national monument lands to drill for oil & mining #BearsEars #nationalMonuments
4814 2018-01-14 20:33:15 I honestly think I'd get the same effect by putting a few drops of peppermint oil into some sweet almond oil, both of which I own, but *shrugs*, I wanted to try it and I like it. Im pre-pooing with it.
4815 2018-01-14 20:33:05 Agree, it is time to stop subsidizing Crony Big Oil and the Crony Banks.  Bring the troops Home.
4816 2018-01-14 20:33:02 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
4817 2018-01-14 20:32:53 If d govt of Nig builds d longest bridge in d world 4 d Niger delta ppl so as to ease transport wahala dr, its nt 2mch considering d fact dt high % of 9ja moni comes 4rm their oil.
4818 2018-01-14 20:32:40 I LITERALLY HAD THE SAME THOUGHT like, "well, three spoons of warm oil is DELICIOUS when it's the right oil on the right food. I put that shit on my salad, too."
4819 2018-01-14 20:32:37 Rumor has it Melissa essential oil is good for heart break. Im planning to get one. Or.. should i get minya senyonyong instead? 
4820 2018-01-14 20:32:37 I can assure you, nothing is being done in Texas. Big Oil Baby!
4821 2018-01-14 20:32:37 That's playable though is it? Looks like an oil spill. 
4822 2018-01-14 20:32:23 Yup cause the oil are just shooting up the standings we are witnessing it first hand man he does not make players around him better
4823 2018-01-14 20:32:01 So I’ve introduced Rose Hip Oil into my skin care routine, has anyone used RH Oil before what’s your thoughts?? #rosehipoil #skincare #beauty
4824 2018-01-14 20:31:56 I win girlfriend/roommate of the year because i spent my Sunday afternoon elbowing through crowds of incompetent people at Costco to make sure we get a bang for our avocado oil buck. @SeanMcGinley2
4825 2018-01-14 20:31:53 It’s beeeeen so hot I don’t remember the last time I saw my coconut oil solid
4826 2018-01-14 20:31:50 ohhh..

i am so behind in car maintenance!

poor baby just getting oil change she needed months ago.
4827 2018-01-14 20:31:48  Try it chopoed in pasta with avocado oil, salt & pepper and pine nuts. And if you feel wealthy, add prawns.
4828 2018-01-14 20:31:41 Pushing oil

4830 2018-01-14 20:31:23 Coconut oil hair treatment, teeth whiting strips and a face mask. #TreatYoSelfSunday 
4831 2018-01-14 20:31:11 What is wrong with three spoonfuls of warm oil, anyway? Especially if it's a really nice olive or nut oil. With it if bread crust or maybe some endive...

I'm hungry now.
4832 2018-01-14 20:31:11 Breathless news coverage of Iranian tanker with 1,000,000 gallons of oil burning & sinking in South China Sea. Why doesn't anybody ask where was it going and who was it selling – delivering the oil to? NOK, China violate sanctions?
4833 2018-01-14 20:31:10 تسلم ايدك محمود
4834 2018-01-14 20:31:08 Oil is not landlocked. It can be shipped by rail to ports - and is. I hold out some hope that CNR's pelletizing bitumen pilot project will be found to be economic and scalable - it would bypass a lot of regional issues.
4835 2018-01-14 20:30:49 Shell chevron bp and others are kicking there lips for that Iranian oil
4836 2018-01-14 20:30:45 Coconut oil with lavender, lemongrass, and tea tree oil overnight soak, shampoo, deep conditioner. Might finally have rehabbed my hair enough to straighten it.
4837 2018-01-14 20:30:45 Lol......Norway built the largest investment fund in the world through pumping oil and gas you idiot.
4838 2018-01-14 20:30:44 *Puts straight oil on my face*

*Face is still dry*
4839 2018-01-14 20:30:37 If you were to pull records of what reservations are paid by the federal government, you would quickly find that money is not the issue. Add in reserves that have oil and minerals that have been paid by private companies, and the matter becomes more clear that money is not issue
4840 2018-01-14 20:30:27 Go buy a magnolia tissue oil from pep stores it works wonders...
4841 2018-01-14 20:30:15 @StormieJenny #Trump doesn't want his water or land in FL contaminated by oil spills. Ppl had temporary insanity when voting for #Trump bc they forgot the #Presidency is our most #prestigious position in #USA. We can't take #gutter & dress it up.
4842 2018-01-14 20:30:03 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.
4843 2018-01-14 20:29:59 And surely producing plant based products such as almond milk/ palm oil isn’t without ecological impact too - monoculture of any form isn’t good for the environment. And the thought of lab grown meat turns my stomach. I’d rather not eat meat at all than this.
4844 2018-01-14 20:29:53 Then threw 3 bottles of castor oil into her cart
4845 2018-01-14 20:29:48 Majority of wars are to steal oil & resources from others
4846 2018-01-14 20:29:44 a lot of candles send me into coughing fits! but I love olbas oil!!  x
4847 2018-01-14 20:29:31 Con, what are you reading on oil prices now? Not just the shale oil threat but also autonomous cars & Elon Musk’s solar panels lowering oil demand. I thought mineral prices might save us but autonomous cars will kill metal demand too. Maybe water exports?
4848 2018-01-14 20:29:16 Try massaging the sides of your jaw with eucalyptus or lavender oil to relieve some of the tension!
4849 2018-01-14 20:29:06 既に関ちゃんの声にメロメロでかなり楽しんでいる様子なので末永くいてほしいですね
4850 2018-01-14 20:28:51 Wouldn’t expect anything less from oil money F.C.
4851 2018-01-14 20:28:50 Inflammation is so painful. So sorry for him Roselyn.. I have found that Turmeric reduces inflammation for my back issues. Along with Frankincense essential oil, which he can mix with Coconut Oil and rub directly on his feet!! Great stuff. I use DoTerra oils
4852 2018-01-14 20:28:42 Per tday's defeat am tempted to blv dat Pep is winning dis league by oil money
4853 2018-01-14 20:28:41 Absolute control 9f the country requires absolute control of the oil. Besides, foreign oil companies only controlled a little fraction of our oil production when compared to PDVSA
4854 2018-01-14 20:28:30 Im getting out the oil field and going to sales or some white collar job
4855 2018-01-14 20:28:21 no, he's right in one respect. It's just that the fuel will be hydrogen not oil. 
4856 2018-01-14 20:28:04 I was shadow banned after WikiLeaks Art Force tweeted my oil painting video of Assange. Apparently painting the "wrong" person is verboten... as are pictures, memes, words, and the people who share them. #1984
4857 2018-01-14 20:27:52 Not as long as average Americans willing 2 fight Koch, Mercer, Walton, Exxon, Big Oil, Big Coal takeover of our democracy & purchase of Republicans. Most can vote, but heavy road blocks laid against our neighbors in poor, rural, urban, POC areas & we have 2 help them bust through
4858 2018-01-14 20:27:38 The scarborough hospital birchmount campus is the worst hospital!Recently a 26 year old mom dead in this hospital only because she cooked dinner and was splashed with oil.The wound is not a fatal injury but she dead after wnet to the hospital！HospitalMurdersPeople@JustinTrudeau

4863 2018-01-14 20:27:20 Yes, the female goats are fatter, so you don't need as much Oil. They also have a different flavor.

Apparently the breasts add quite a bit of fat and flavor.
4864 2018-01-14 20:27:12 They (e.g., Kochs, Big Oil, Saudis, and Putin) feared HRC more than death.
The ONLY way to end this nightmare occurs in #295Days 2/2

4865 2018-01-14 20:26:41 Man changing my oil: “I used to have the same car but then my crazy ex gf broke into my house when she was drunk, stole my car and then wrecked it. Found it in a ditch outside my neighborhood... but it was a real good car.” 
Me: “......I hate when that happens”
4866 2018-01-14 20:26:35 Yes burning that midnight oil last night and just waking up lol
4867 2018-01-14 20:26:27 Well,  if CFC had a better strike, than that one with so much oil on his head called morata, most definitely the gap won't be more than 1 or 2 points. But anyways, LFC played very well and showed they can move on well without Coutinho. TBH  ds man city are a terror but beatable
4868 2018-01-14 20:26:24 Ignorant questions: 
Would lifeboats have escaped safely?
Was it perhaps not clear until it was too late that they needed to abandon ship?
Are oil tankers more or less likely to shortchange maintenance on lifeboats?
4869 2018-01-14 20:26:15 29 (1-14): #Geopolitical risks to #US #oil_supply lowest since the early 1970s
4870 2018-01-14 20:26:13 Use vitamin c creams they are great. Or creams with rosewater or its oil. As both are great toners and help balance the skin reaction to the environment.
4871 2018-01-14 20:26:09 They are also a large producer of Oil. That's why they can take good care of there people
4872 2018-01-14 20:25:51 I read once that the solution came from an international contest and that the red O was to stand out the word Oil. Great brand!
4873 2018-01-14 20:25:51 While we don't have an option with the exact same scent you might enjoy our Happy Happy Joy Joy Conditioner! Rose and jojoba oils condition while grapefruit oil and orange blossom water leave a fruity-floral perfume in your hair. 
4874 2018-01-14 20:25:50 Cannot keep a good stock down. ..business in best shape since  fire and set back..oil price rocketing. .price  will follow you have my word  :-)
4875 2018-01-14 20:25:50 CA, OR, & WA gave nothing in common with this Administration. They ignore us, unless they want to drill for oil & ruin our coasts & environment...without asking our permission.
4876 2018-01-14 20:25:49 The #winner of the Years Supply Of Beard Oil provided by our friends at @thatchface has been notified. Thank you to everyone who entered and well done to the lucky winner, however fear not! We shall be running more competitions this week AND every week for the foreseeable future.
4877 2018-01-14 20:25:41 A country where we produce crude oil,export it and get it back before consumption is a shithole
4878 2018-01-14 20:25:36 And bread and a whole lot of oil?
4879 2018-01-14 20:25:29 Put coconut oil in your hair and sleep with it overnight.
4880 2018-01-14 20:25:25 You sir are nothing but a  oil salesman. Your deal was shit and still is shit. NO OPEN BORDERS! MONEY FOR THE WALL AND BORDER SECURITY! MERIT BASED IMMIGRATION!
4881 2018-01-14 20:25:15 Every time it’s sold, license and registration, fuel, repairs, tires, smog and oil changes! There should not be a tax on anything used ever!
4882 2018-01-14 20:25:09 try tea tree oil
4883 2018-01-14 20:24:54 There are puddles of butter on the toast and the eggs are covered in oil. Why is this triggering me so badly 
4884 2018-01-14 20:24:37 By destroying our National Lands and coastlines? We already EXPORT OIL! Have you read the tax plan bill. I dont listen to the media I read the legislation for myself. Koreans talking bc Trump has created tensions between them s Korea wants to avert war! Trump is a moron!
4885 2018-01-14 20:24:27 hot oil treatment got my scalp feeling like heaven bro .
4886 2018-01-14 20:24:08 The OIL destroys the yolk...
4887 2018-01-14 20:24:02 Not every club has unlimited oil money to assemble a squad of ridiculous talent  
4888 2018-01-14 20:23:59 It's my go to now. I make it, cut it up, wrap and freeze. My son grabs one on his way out the door for yummy healthy breakfast. I use whole wheat flour, replace oil with Apple sauce. Dark chocolate. Lots of pecans.
4889 2018-01-14 20:23:56 Lanolin is fuegoooo. I boiled down lanolin, almond oil and vitamin e oil and use it as a night balm before I sleep.
4890 2018-01-14 20:23:45 Something similar happened in the OIL (@okiraqi) in 2007. The @Whackers_FF didn't make a move all season but beat their rival @NormanNobodies in the OIL Bowl.

4894 2018-01-14 20:22:57 Nafake iintlok'emasendeni whilst our country was auctioned off to Russia, IMF and the Guptas by @PresidencyZA. The National debt has quadrupled, the country's oil & gas reserves sold via back door & the country's emergency funds have been looted nithule. Fustek naaam.
4895 2018-01-14 20:22:55 blow outs suck!!! so im just dummy scared to stretch more but tbh im just gonna do it and bathe in jojoba oil
4896 2018-01-14 20:22:55 But don't expect too many hard guarantees. For instance, oil is around $70 today but who knows what price it will be in a month let alone a year. Get the forecast wrong, as EVERYBODY did in 2014, and you never hear the end of it! :-)
4897 2018-01-14 20:22:49 True, if you can decrease cholesterol with diet and exercise than do it! Add fiber, fish oil, b vitamins decrease simple carbs! And cut back on saturated fat and add good fats
4898 2018-01-14 20:22:43 145 million barrels in the entire Caribbean vs 300 billion barrels reserve in Venezuela. Seeing this credible source inflated his country’s oil reserve figures to a laughable number how is one to trust any other figure he spits out?
4899 2018-01-14 20:22:09 A giant mall, oil and hockey in the 80's.
4900 2018-01-14 20:22:07 A thread of great minds thinking alike laugh out loud
4901 2018-01-14 20:22:07 This is huge! It's all about the oil. Amazed it didn't get coverage back then.  
4902 2018-01-14 20:22:05 And poisoned us all. And allowed banking interests to harm consumers with impunity. And gifted national parks to oil and mining interests. And abandoned Salvadoran people to murderous gang warfare. Shall we go on?
4903 2018-01-14 20:21:58 Native Californian here but concur 100%. Slithering snake oil salesman aka con artist. You only had to watch his BS on his lame reality show
4904 2018-01-14 20:21:46 Its a pity that the largest producer of crude oil in Afruca cannot saturate the continent with petroleum products rather than worrying about hoarding and smuggling.
4905 2018-01-14 20:21:36 Lol @ baby oil
4906 2018-01-14 20:21:34 Be patient Trump has OPENED ALL of those oil fields for a reason 
4907 2018-01-14 20:21:27 He apologized and he stated very clearly that he had misread her cues and didn't mean to make her uncomfortable.
4908 2018-01-14 20:21:15 this might sound dum as flat earth but if we are constantly taking water from the cycle and drilling into the earth for oil and using so much of its natural resources is the earth shrinking
4909 2018-01-14 20:21:10 A large pile of giant silver balls. Also oil...
4910 2018-01-14 20:20:52 The man needs to resign period meaning zinke because he has no respect for life no respect how the lands are cherished and he has no respect that no one wants oil, mining, gas, coal, fracking logging or anything that he must destroy to benefit himself and his oil cronies. SHAME!
4911 2018-01-14 20:20:43 I always have to Google US vehicles cos different names to UK... That looks huge too! And 3.5l that's too thirsty for UK oil prices! :)
4912 2018-01-14 20:20:42 Tbh I think to. That Juve side had an impressive hunger and determination. But the players were not of the high quality as the City team. Understandble since they are built with oil money.

4915 2018-01-14 20:20:10 The best part: "100% motor oil & other ingredients" and "100% motor oil free" COULD BOTH BE TRUE.   Although we are only 100% sure about the first one.

4924 2018-01-14 20:18:19 Although this not purely oil related, will you show development in port construction for Mubarak vs. Great Fao? Both just north of the refinery location I believe.
4925 2018-01-14 20:18:09 You mean that auto industry that paid back the loans and is keeping operations going?  Maybe you are confused with the oil industry that is being subsidized and still charging outrageous sums for refined products.
4926 2018-01-14 20:17:41 MWAH HAHAHAH! i went yesterday and dropped 1/2 a fortune. (they were still out of the oil color i want, I requested a restock of that item over 20 times now haha)

4928 2018-01-14 20:17:28 The government is about to start targeting TESLA electric cars. They saw the threat to Big Oil. 
Meanwhile, Tesla is doubling charging stations in Australia this year. Too late Turnbull, can't hold back the future. #auspol
4929 2018-01-14 20:17:10 - including parks, monuments, and shores - to mining and drilling, lawsuits can put moratoria in place to stop these from happening until all judicial recourse is settled. It's not like you'll see oil derricks spring up like mushrooms overnight. But if permitted, you will see >
4930 2018-01-14 20:16:54 @POTUS @DHSgov Remittances from Mexican immigrants in the US are a major source of income in Mexico, second only to oil & surpassing even the tourism industry.

First they took away our guns, then slowly the EU leaders being funded out of NY started closing down the borders for a new Religion that hated Christian Culture!

4960 2018-01-14 20:12:20 Coconut oil has got me through some very bad allergic reactions on my face, when nothing else has. Meanwhile shea butter can give me puffy eyes if I use too much. Everyone's skin is different

4989 2018-01-14 20:09:02 I looked like that the first time I changed the oil on my truck. Apparently you are supposed to put the oil catcher in place and move your head before removing the sump plug.

4997 2018-01-14 20:06:55 To bad I will not see anything close to that lol My electricity bill is crazy, the water bill is even worse. what I find odd is that we now have so much of our own energy and oil, yet gas keeps going up in my city!
4998 2018-01-14 20:06:43 They dont have to do anything. Iran has world 2nd largest gas reserve and 4th largest oil reserve, they spend those money for everythings. Thats why economic sanctions cant hold these mullahs back. They are ok with killing 11 yrs old boys, so u can understand how vile they are.
4999 2018-01-14 20:06:43 Sounds like I-29 crash is near the exit to West Madison Street. Only responding unit is to clean up some oil, so no one seriously hurt.

5011 2018-01-14 20:04:51 Oil prices are at an all time high. This was surely coming!! My thought would be the price review should be once every two months!! Petrol stations will sell cheaply acquired gas at reviewed market price.

5014 2018-01-14 20:04:32 Also for the past week my body has been rejecting oil so I guess that 2018 re up is gonna happen one way or another.
5015 2018-01-14 20:04:03 It's understandable. He probably had the margarine of fish and chips, made with vegetable oil.
5016 2018-01-14 20:03:58 It be so heartbreaking when a hair product spills  this oil spilled in my hair bucket so now everything is covered in oil 
5017 2018-01-14 20:03:24 Can't rule out oil money influencing media narrative 
5018 2018-01-14 20:03:19 I mean, I guess they can include in the bill that you MUST us US labor, companies, etc. Trump signed an EO that new oil pipelines must us 100% US steel.

5022 2018-01-14 20:02:45 Then why the push to subsidise energy independence with small solar and wind for personal off grid homes. Seems to contradict the controlling energy theory. Since we’re removing the dependence of a a few in control of all oil.
5023 2018-01-14 20:02:30 Customers (demand) are primary drivers. If shale companies deliver inadequate products or poor quality (mixed/inconsistent WTI oil)  they will just bring the price down.
5024 2018-01-14 20:02:29 We’re already overspending on our military..how about taking some of that abundance & actually spend it on the vets you’re all so concerned with helping before people from countries being destroyed in oil wars??
5025 2018-01-14 20:02:22 Glad you escaped one and sad you can't the other. I can still recall the horrible taste of paregoric and it's crude oil rainbow like sheen How is your hand?

5036 2018-01-14 20:00:38 Well, read a lot! I'm inclined to believe that if we move more towards wind/solar, instead of oil, then we could break from Saudi Arabia.. thus quit backing the war on Yemen. Again, as always, seems to come down to the almighty dollar!
5037 2018-01-14 20:00:31 P.Trump(US) Africa's  Man of the year 2018 for making a diagnosis of Africa's sickness.Africs has gold, petrol, diamonds, Uranium, bauxite, copper, titanium, Cocoa, bananas,palm oil etc.Its people wallop in poverty. Shit,yes this is shit.

5040 2018-01-14 20:00:12 Lol it is always the ones who are the farthest thing from an oil painting that criticize other ppl’s looks
5041 2018-01-14 20:00:04 We can't have an oil rig visible from Mar-a-Lago.  haha
5042 2018-01-14 19:59:50 We don't have much support for ginkgo biloba. Ginseng extract and fish oil have a better track record.
5043 2018-01-14 19:59:45 This is where it's dicey, right? I don't want to deny her agency in this, but we can't assume everyone is as strong or capable as I, or we, are. Her weakness doesn't excuse his manipulation of that to his own advantage and the setting himself up as a paragon of #TimesUp

5049 2018-01-14 19:58:32 Y’all. These Sennelier oil pastels are blowing my mind! 
5050 2018-01-14 19:58:30 Yes, that's what I find off.  Nigeria in rolling in dough!
Yet, many people are miserably poor.
It is so corrupt there!  The oil companies don't bother to help, just payoff what they need.  Gates should have mentioned it.  Maybe he did. To change govt a bit - would help lots!
5051 2018-01-14 19:58:27 Iranian families angry at loss of life onboard Sanchi oil tanker
5052 2018-01-14 19:58:24 People get so shitty when you tell them no or there’s a wait for something. Learn to change your oil yourself and maybe you wouldn’t have to wait and bitch about it
5053 2018-01-14 19:58:07 Can't believe Sanchez would go to United for blood money when City were willing to pay him in adopted children and well wishes. #Oil
5054 2018-01-14 19:57:53 It is unfair to humanity to call him human. I have my doubts, but he has shown his racism since before the campaign trail. Peddle snake oil elsewhere.
5055 2018-01-14 19:57:26 I don't want your cannabis oil, stop this pls
5056 2018-01-14 19:56:43 Shangai Energy Exchanged opens 1/18 & will buy oil with gold-backed yuan. Russia also can trade with gold-back ruble. Do we go to war with Russian & China? USD under threat. Bombs have been our previous response.

5058 2018-01-14 19:56:11 The day I drench my hair in coconut oil is when we finally run out of shampoo... Sound about right

5062 2018-01-14 19:55:18 I guess that's why I don't like modern bikes and now I've ended up working with parts that were on bikes before I was born. Even if my rides are a bit newer, old red and old blue both have a scent of oil, petrol and dirt about them, glorious.
5063 2018-01-14 19:55:10 Maybe stop doing things to make those countries hate us. Like overthrowing their govt (Iran) and taking their oil (Iraq) and killing their children (Yemen or most of the middle east.) Just a thought.
5064 2018-01-14 19:55:07 Our business,taxes pay 4 war,US military die,innocent ppl die & why? US petro $. Saddam wanted 2 sell oil 4 Euros. Gaddafi wanted to back a pan-African currency w gold to sell oil. Now what? US petro $ in danger. 1/2
5065 2018-01-14 19:54:55 And to his credit the very next time she talked to him he apologized. If women want men to pick up on their cues during a sexual encounter then women also need to be responsible to pick up on very clear cues coming from Men about what their intentions are.
5066 2018-01-14 19:54:54 No I leave it in 3 in 1 oil.
5067 2018-01-14 19:54:53 Um yeah, why is there not more coverage of these events.
Didn’t BHO send the mullah’s enough cash to allow western journalists in the country? This may be just the beginning in Iran. Persian lives matter. Rattle them sabers. Oil’s going up.
5068 2018-01-14 19:54:52 Oil is moving up. I wouldn't buy Bitcoin except to buy another coin.ARS/UPL/AST.
5069 2018-01-14 19:54:39 You can bet Russia and perhaps Exxon and the like are behind trump desperately trying to grab land for oil. Evilness and greed and willing to sell their souls to obtain it. They got money and power but are the lowest scum on our planet.

Like in my head I'm screaming "RUB IT IN QUICK BEFORE IT DRIPS"
5076 2018-01-14 19:53:15 Do you have any electric backups? We ran out of oil for our furnace last week but thankfully have some space heaters to help pick up the slack until we can afford more oil. Stay warm! *squishes and snuggles and sends you coffee and hot soup*
5077 2018-01-14 19:53:07 Yeah, once I wash out the conditioner mine gets back frizzy, you can see the part I haven't done in the picture already frizzy.

But I do a leave in, a oil and then the gel to keep it from getting frizzy through out the week
5078 2018-01-14 19:53:00 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: ExxonMobil looks to increase its oil drilling in Guyana
5079 2018-01-14 19:52:57 It’s cavalo nero which is so much tastier than kale. We chop it up and sauté with chilli, garlic and olive oil. It’s delicious.

5085 2018-01-14 19:52:02 How much oil and land did we keep again?

It was about killing Military age male jihadists.  Fight them there instead of here.
5086 2018-01-14 19:51:48 Life is so unfair to Donald Fucking Trump. Let me oil up my violin.
5087 2018-01-14 19:51:46 Oil trending towards $80/barrel? We probably gave him a tip on top of it

5094 2018-01-14 19:50:35 That sure won't help the climate scam, I mean change. You only need so much oil to lubricate an electric car in China.

5106 2018-01-14 19:49:02 I do all my own oil and tune ups in the garage and always get fascinating looks from neighbors. My wife’s Prius, minivan and my old truck.

Maybe the last “white trash” behavior I’ve held on to. 

I’ve kept my 1991 f150 I love it manual extended cab. Looks weird in my neighborhoo

5108 2018-01-14 19:48:58 Indian oil consumption in 2017 grew at its slowest in 4 years, hit by the government's demonetisation move & a tax increase that knocked the gain in fuel use back to a modest 2.3% #Oil #India #business

5111 2018-01-14 19:48:54 Well I think what set this in motion was him mugging the cams wearing a MeToo pin at the Globes. But whether her motive is revenge or just a warning for others I think is fair subject for debate.

"Ummm...yes, swiss (I point to swiss she wrote down.)
5113 2018-01-14 19:48:38 90% of the electricity used to recharge the batteries is produced by oil. Plus the oil used to make those cars will result in a 10% oil savings.  Smoke and mirrors! The government again taking your eye off the ball and the real problems!!

5118 2018-01-14 19:47:29 It's such a pretty day today. Shame there are no waves, who wants to paddle out to the nearest oil rig w me?
5119 2018-01-14 19:47:13 "We can make it."

He says it firmly, as if that will make it so.

He hand picks a few items from the crate to put in the back seat of the car, including the bread and peanut butter, the lamp, a bottle of the oil, and the matches.

Then he adds the chocolates. ~
5120 2018-01-14 19:47:11 Think about it

We are encouraged to diversify from oil to agriculture.  Some investors do so,  only for Fulani herdsmen to trample,  and eat up the crops 

Are we diversifying to feed cows or the nation?

5126 2018-01-14 19:46:15 Two of my young cousins got married this past year to men who work in the oil industry. I see the young women who’ve lost their husbands on the #Sanchi and that’s all I can think of.
5127 2018-01-14 19:46:10 One negative I’ve noticed about suburbanites is that they do nothing for themselves. Always guatamalan Molly maids in the suburb. They don’t change their own oil or do tuneups. They never have tools or jumper cables. They are rarely prepared for anything.
5128 2018-01-14 19:46:05 Um, where did that money come from? The sale of their playmaker for 142 million. Perhaps you remember? Not oil and gas.

5152 2018-01-14 19:41:36 The woman discusses this though. She says she is not sure whether basically it is bad sex or assault. She doesn't conclusively land anywhere, except that he "took advantage" of the situation. Also to her credit, the very next time he talked to her she confronted him.
5153 2018-01-14 19:41:18 What are you talking about. There were many smaller oil companies but because of Liberal and NDP policies a lot had to sell to large multinational corporation. Like Suncore buying up all it can. So I ask you who is really in bed with multinational corporation.
5154 2018-01-14 19:41:16 Is very unfortunate. Human life loss and aquatic life will also be affected due to oil spills and the sea will be polluted.

5167 2018-01-14 19:38:31 my mama got some type of Dominican oil that bring ya edges back...but I’m scared cus it ain’t got no label 
5168 2018-01-14 19:38:15 Thank you!! I started using coconut oil last night :)
5169 2018-01-14 19:38:06 I think a see a "hole" in our conversation.  I was responding to your criticism of the gas tax and stated why it was necessary--the roads are in sore need of repair.  I am ALL FOR alternatives to oil and do NOT advocate for off shore drilling.
5170 2018-01-14 19:38:03 i bought the ud makeup melt down oil stick yesterday and it’s one of the best purchases i’ve made wOw

5172 2018-01-14 19:37:59 Why do people always bring up Norway's oil reserves to discredit social democracy/Nordic model when Sweden and Finland exist?

I'm not saying it works in the longterm but domestic oil production is not the primary issue.
5173 2018-01-14 19:37:41 I’d let an average citizen sit in their empty seats; plumbers, miners, truck drivers, cooks, electricians, cable service techs, law enforcement workers, firemen, ambulance workers, veterans, UPS & FedEx workers, and oil field workers. That would so cool and appropriate!!
5174 2018-01-14 19:37:26 I take it this is not a lightbulb or oil change we’re talking about here
5175 2018-01-14 19:37:20 Salt, pepper, olive oil, white wine, vegetable broth, onion, cheese, rice and ? Che significa della zucca?

5177 2018-01-14 19:36:56 #Sanchi tragedy is proof of two things: 1- Tehran's failure of foreign policy. 2- For the Iranian government, the lives of Iranian citizens/ workers are not worthy of being rescued as far as the oil and the ship are gone.

5179 2018-01-14 19:36:38 Before FSG we were relevant....before the oil money from Sheikh Mansour city were not
5180 2018-01-14 19:36:37 I just giggled at the fact that the oil has edge on it XD
5181 2018-01-14 19:36:10 And @billmckibben should practice what he preaches and cease to use all petroleum based products.  If you are blaming big oil for all the world's problems and continue to use their products you are a yuge hypocrite.
5182 2018-01-14 19:35:52 Amla oil was our bread and butter
5183 2018-01-14 19:35:51 That's exactly what I read as well she liked him she wanted him to like her so she gave in and performed sexual acts she wasn't comfortable with. That's called regret not abuse. No is a complete sentence.
5184 2018-01-14 19:35:46 Then let's quit subsidizing oil and coal and make them compete on equal footing with alternative energy.
5185 2018-01-14 19:35:25 No but i’ll have a go at Peak Oil or 3g pitches 
Have the clique banned you ?

5189 2018-01-14 19:35:07 I was going to say the exact same thing, thanks for the good faith discussion. I appreciate the dialog.
5190 2018-01-14 19:35:02 Am I right in the assumption you should choose virgin coconut oil over refined?
5191 2018-01-14 19:34:56 @hotrodcod I played at Roger's place at an Oil Kings game. I performed 4 of my originals how do I get paid through @SOCANmusic ?
5192 2018-01-14 19:34:51 Glad all the #WhiteSupremacists now love #Norway.
Norway is a successful socialist economy.
And the oil company is owned by the citizens.
Take THAT, corporate 'Murica!
5193 2018-01-14 19:34:35 My favorite YL oil is hands down peace and calming!!!! Need I say more?!?
5194 2018-01-14 19:34:25 Getting very bullish on #oil many years of underinvestment is resulting in heavy production declines. Se oil back to $90+ a barrel this year

5199 2018-01-14 19:33:24 Great new way to eat our Tex Mex veggie burgers! The Bronx gets the famed chopped cheese sandwich crispy with oil, cast iron, and cheese. Why not do the same? Oil a pan, chop burgers til every bit's crisp with browned flavor, then shave on jack cheese. Sandwich OR taco filling.
5200 2018-01-14 19:33:11 You only need a cupful at most, heated 'gently' before adding the cabbage. Tip: if simering on the hob, lightly grease the pot with a bit of soft butter or cooking oil first.
5201 2018-01-14 19:33:09 Yes!  That’s why Trump wants Norwegians.  It’s such a shithole with its oil and socialism.
5202 2018-01-14 19:33:07 Great atmosphere great game. So many Oil fans
5203 2018-01-14 19:32:53 I just need one line of hair care products for natural hair. That’s it. It must have

4. Oil and cream
5. Leave - in Conditioner

5204 2018-01-14 19:32:50 We'd probably need to do some good digging into oil and gas agreements, then.  A lot of projects are supported by tax dollars - ie, royalty kick backs on projects for a certain amount of time.

5211 2018-01-14 19:31:32 Thank for the you lot lowering that’s not debating and I was speaking from talking to oil workers who say not all of the oil is landed in the uk to avoid uk tax and unlike other countries we don’t charge to licence oil companies to drill we subsidies them instead but hey ho
5212 2018-01-14 19:31:32 Better visit them now before trump let's oil and miners destroy them.
5213 2018-01-14 19:31:03 I haven’t been drinking sodas and that witch hazel & coconut oil did my face something nice

5218 2018-01-14 19:30:05 I put tea tree oil in my deep conditioner for my hair and thought my scalp was burning out . Apparently it's just stimulation of the scalp. 
5219 2018-01-14 19:29:47 one like and i’ll put my face in boiling hot oil
5220 2018-01-14 19:29:32 Here's my main point: We cannot as women expect men to pick up on our cues when we are failing to recognize theirs. Both people in this situation we're giving off cues neither one was listening to the other, that is not abuse.

5221 2018-01-14 19:29:30 .....Yes, Zizou broke records Champs.League back to back etc, History recognises such events...but for you to say we must recognise Pep because of an unbeaten run which was fueled by Oil money is ...rather sad.

5224 2018-01-14 19:28:47 Today is a perfect (frigid) day to sip great coffee, read lines, write, & deeply exfoliate my beard, then saturate it with all-natural beard oil; it's the simple things in life. =)
5225 2018-01-14 19:28:40 Q Luke:  Who trusts China yet?  You still have to look at satellite imaging to verify their fake #s.  Aren't they are a long way from gaining credibility in order to dethrone the US $.  Or does credibility/accountability matter?  If they are largest oil importer?
5226 2018-01-14 19:28:39 A trick I like to use is to rub some safflower oil on my tips just prior to bathing or showering.

5231 2018-01-14 19:27:31 Why has nobody pointed out that #Norway is a successful socialist state in which the oil industry is completed nationalized and every citizen has a government pension?

When Trump says it's great, his supporters should logically be horrified.  Norway is Bernie Sanders' wet dream.
5232 2018-01-14 19:27:24 But I will say, there's a difference between those who stand out front wearing a MeToo pin and those who just quietly go about their business.
5233 2018-01-14 19:27:10 I use tablespoon of olive oil fresh lemon juice finely chopped garlic shredded cucumber (squeezed and lightly salted) plain greek yoghurt and finely chopped dill.

5238 2018-01-14 19:26:46 The cities looking to go after big oil have ignored multiple attempts by us to examine #refrigeration coil cleaning for energy efficiency savings and indirect GHG emission reduction, including for units they are running !!: contributory negligence on their part I'd say.

5240 2018-01-14 19:26:33 The last time Canadian RE got smoked was 1981 when rates peaked at ~21%, and this was exacerbated by oil's decline through the 80`s. One could make the argument that today's market is much more inflated via foreign $. What do you think will be the pin to pop RE this time around?
5241 2018-01-14 19:26:32 Kia Service tech nipped the oil seal on the filter last Monday.  I was stuck just off the A90 as no oil in engine. All over the engine bay and trailing behind me.  One more nail in the ICE car's coffin...  #EV is the future
5242 2018-01-14 19:26:17 Yeah, right ... at least that's how it is where I live ... the fact is that federal Liberals enjoy unprecedented popular support and that in all provinces, except maybe Alberta people are not supporting 2-tier healthcare. I assume not even in Alberta with oil downturn cycle 
5243 2018-01-14 19:26:16 Whole potato in the air fryer for 30 min at what temp? Also do they need rubbed with oil or anything? lol I need to try this.
5244 2018-01-14 19:26:13 Fair enough. I'm torn, because I do think this sort of thing happens and I want young ladies to be aware of how power dynamics can be used against you. I have a personal story of a famous person doing this, and I've never gone public. It's all so complicated.
5245 2018-01-14 19:26:04 That Amla hair oil is soo good but stinks like shit 
5246 2018-01-14 19:25:58 No its due to the low price of oil and the cost to extract it, once again you lot just make up shit to keep your hopes up, cannot debate anymore with someone who can't even be true to themselves, c ya.

5252 2018-01-14 19:24:54 Laurie, do you watch Food Forcast on ABC with Ginger Zee, as her 2nd season has 1 on Grass Fed which is very informative and Bees, Virgin Olive Oil etc. ?
5253 2018-01-14 19:24:48 b/c Petry plays better most nights. But when he’s off he’s brutal. He was worse in Edm. That’s why Oil Petry is not the guy Habs want at $5.5M
5254 2018-01-14 19:24:46 Boycotting the State of the Union Address is genius.  It would send an unequivocal message to Trump & his loyal followers. A boycott would literally separate the good from the bad, just like oil and vinegar!
5255 2018-01-14 19:24:39 I agree. Personally, I wouldn't want an unstable gov't like that from our neighbors w/ nukes, cause fallout goes where the wind blows, not only at the targets. China also has a massive problem with NK defectors illegally crossing too. Haven't seen the oil report, but believe it
5256 2018-01-14 19:24:36 New soap, new oil to use after I shower and linen spray. I’m going to sleep on a CLOUD tonight 
5257 2018-01-14 19:24:36 Developing brain definitely an area where I remain cautious in regards to cannabis oil, also the reason I don’t advise vaccines for anyone younger than 21.
If you are stupid enough to still want a vaccine by then go crazy.
5258 2018-01-14 19:24:32 i gotta get an oil change this week but i’ll text you 
5259 2018-01-14 19:24:31 The plot of Cars 2 is pretty complicated. How did little kids understand that the old cars were trying to discredit alternative fuel so they could make money off their oil reserve when all cars used traditional gasoline again??
5260 2018-01-14 19:24:31 If we had any gumption, we'd go out and inherit an oil well.

5265 2018-01-14 19:23:18 We're decreasing the use of it, we're not completely getting rid of it. It's a process. Adding 90% more will move us backwards. No more NEW oil rigs.

5271 2018-01-14 19:22:43 Iran wants nuclear power because they want to export their oil and gas instead of using it to generate electricity.

5276 2018-01-14 19:22:10 1. We initially supported Mossadegh and negotiated with him extensively.
2. Iranian oil didn’t have a major impact on American prices in 1953 because of domestic production. 
3. Mossadegh wasn’t exactly democratic by 1953.

5278 2018-01-14 19:22:06 I had a antec water cooler.... Nope. If you get liquid cooling at all. Be it either oil based or water with its own reservoir. My max on the 6700k on my current air cooler is 70c
5279 2018-01-14 19:21:49 Even in this frigid weather I saw the bandelero-wearing dude selling his essential oils. I told him I get as many compliments on the $5.00 oil I buy from his colleagues as I do on the $70 cologne I buy on the Internet (more in stores).

5286 2018-01-14 19:20:47 She did ... it showed a slight positive impact for scotland but ignored oil ownership, which, when taken into account, made it negative.
5287 2018-01-14 19:20:42 Lol when it comes to parts, always buy from anywhere except autozone lmao. And never ever go to a mechanic by yourself unless it’s an easy job like an oil change 
5288 2018-01-14 19:20:21 Never with oil .
5289 2018-01-14 19:20:12 Haven't seen signs of a recession currently. I do fear a grotesque raises in gasoline prices. Would love it if Trump can stop greedy oil companies like no other president has done in the past
5290 2018-01-14 19:19:58 The ultra-rich are exposed as a lot longer, to buy a sure thing. We need to only to underline the Independent Oil and promoted
5291 2018-01-14 19:19:47 I have peppermint oil cotton balls down to keep it out of my living area.
5292 2018-01-14 19:19:40 I do believe they got caught already sneaking oil to NK. I would think they would have a lot to loose with NK having Nuclear weapons. Having a unstable gov with them should make even them worried.

5300 2018-01-14 19:18:38 I absolutely do yes. A spotlight has been focused on his absolutely gross and disgusting behavior. I hope no one ever wants to date him but he didn't abuse this woman and I believe this is a very dangerous precedent we're setting with this kind of accusation.

5303 2018-01-14 19:18:19 It cant change in 1 day and main reason why you have to handle Arab is OIL .. OIL is all ..
5304 2018-01-14 19:18:06 Why mince words when you can mince garlic, sweat it in olive oil with chopped onion, deglaze with a white wine, then add some tomatoes and fresh basil and oregano? Simmer until sweet and fragrant, then toss with pasta of your choice. Serve with a mixed-greens salad.
5305 2018-01-14 19:18:00 I tried the fish oil...for 6 months...did nothing...asked my doctor his opinion...he laughed...said I was wasting my money...
5306 2018-01-14 19:17:47 And I got a $640 fine for doing a piss against a tree at the midnight oil concert in the dark. What a joke.

5309 2018-01-14 19:17:38 Hi, Professor! Here’s my family’s recipe: (1) Boil chicken broth & water in a pot. (2) Sauté minced garlic & julienned ginger in a pan of oil, then add chicken wings & drumettes and lightly brown. (3) Transfer wings & drumettes to pot and lower heat.
5310 2018-01-14 19:17:36 That seems to ignore scale and time. Oil comes from carbon-based life and there's plenty of that around...
5311 2018-01-14 19:17:32 Meanwhile, Obama wants Iran to have nuclear energy while they sit on a lake of oil instead of solar and wind like the so called green Democrats want for the US. Hmm.

5316 2018-01-14 19:17:01 my niece was playing with a bottle of baby oil (it's got a childproof lid) and i thought there was no way she could open it but not ONE minute later this child had the lid in one hand and the open bottle in another....how
5317 2018-01-14 19:16:59 I wonder what @jkenney will do when CEOs of oil companies point out that they are feeling pressure from the banks to improve their environmental images. No carbon tax from the prov, potential for no loans from banks.

5326 2018-01-14 19:16:09 Tax from oil is nil due to the management of North Sea oil prices are up GERS is estimated the best est we can get granted based on Barnett and uk expenditures too it will not represent an independant economy
5327 2018-01-14 19:16:07 I’m sad af they saying my oil change is like 80

5330 2018-01-14 19:15:26 In truth, I think it is already too late. However, oil and gas is heavily invested in old technology and they are determined to drain the last dead dinosaurs from the Earth's crust. I really think we are beyond the threshold of changing anything.
5331 2018-01-14 19:15:09 Is chili oil a protein?

5333 2018-01-14 19:14:43 Do you consider the story itself punishment? Other than taking some crap on twitter for a day or two, I don't think he will lose his show or award or anything.

5335 2018-01-14 19:14:26 Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them PRAY. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to PRAY over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.                    James 5:13-14

5338 2018-01-14 19:13:36 Caroline, Oil spills are rare, but yes they do happen. On land, on the sea, and anywhere there's oil. New facilities built properly should mitigate that threat. Bottom line is you cannot live without oil and to regulate it to death is self defeating.
5339 2018-01-14 19:13:35 one day this week when i get off early imma get my oil changed & wash my car

5345 2018-01-14 19:12:31 The California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska coastlines are breathtakingly beautiful.  We do not want nor need offshore drilling. 

Renewable energy technology is available now and will continue to become more affordable. We do not need to drill for oil. #protectoutcoast
5346 2018-01-14 19:12:25 Ladies!!! Coconut oil, lavender  and vitamin E oil  in your warm bath will do wonders for your skin especially after a nice shave lol your skin will be insanely soft. I’m only tryna help. Stay moisturized !!
5347 2018-01-14 19:12:17 If you like weird 70s style grindhouse horror, Blood Drive on SyFy was quite good - it’s set in mid 2000s iirc after fracking split the USA in half & has a cannonball-like race from coast to coast but due to high oil costs the cars run on blood...
5348 2018-01-14 19:12:09 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5349 2018-01-14 19:11:53 
5350 2018-01-14 19:11:47 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
5351 2018-01-14 19:11:38 I think it was referenced by either of Achebe or Forsyth, not entirely sure though. 

Finished Oil, Politics and Violence last November, randomly stumbled upon it at a motor park. It was very educative too... 

Is there any other one?
5352 2018-01-14 19:11:21 This cute guy at Nissan did my oil change along time ago, and he jus hmu rn wtf I don't want u no more:/
5353 2018-01-14 19:10:53 GOOD, because the price of oil, and therefore all goods & services, is going UP
5354 2018-01-14 19:10:53 Really? I just throw it in a crock pot with garlic gloves and olive oil. It all scrapes out in 2 minutes
5355 2018-01-14 19:10:48 I feel so bad for your car. (Check the oil)
5356 2018-01-14 19:10:43 I know cannabis oil can be helpful for certain conditions. Problems arise when it's claimed that it can do more than it can and that pharmaceuticals cannot do what they do quite well.

5362 2018-01-14 19:10:11 I started taking fish oil pills because cooking fish stunk up my house. Doctor said only twice a week, pill or fish.
5363 2018-01-14 19:10:06 It is but it's lower than august 2014 and the SNP lost 500'000 voters at the GE, sturgeon's popularity rating is down to the minus figures, folk are pig sick of the education system ,GERS figures show a £14bn year on year deficit, tax from oil is virtually nil and growth low.
5364 2018-01-14 19:10:05 i love drinking coffee with coconut oil bc it makes my lips so smooth
5365 2018-01-14 19:09:46 Fish oil will increase your hdl level.  There is no evidence that ginkgo biloba has any positive effects.
5366 2018-01-14 19:09:39 Only when I want my meal burnt through lack of oil
5367 2018-01-14 19:09:30 My question would be that if you’re not comfortable leaving/saying “no” to somebody, why do you go on the date to begin with? Generally when two adults agree on a date it’s with the understanding that there’s at least the possibility of the night ending with a sexual encounter.
5368 2018-01-14 19:09:26 I noticed the Tories very fast to bribe Scotland to stay during the #Indyref with Barnett, amongst others. Because nothing says exploitation like,stealing all our oil revenue then refusing to give us our share back.
5369 2018-01-14 19:09:24 Just use natural oil and then topcoat. It will darken over time.

5372 2018-01-14 19:08:51 Instead of retweeting their own tweet, @engadget just did a new one so all the commentary on the _obvious_ late deployment is lost. Are you guys paid for this or what? Come on, this is obviously a horribly useless, snake oil product.

5375 2018-01-14 19:07:51 It’s honestly not that bad. If the skin is super smooth I slip more and have a harder time doing what I want. I don’t think of it at all. The more hair the more oil is all.
5376 2018-01-14 19:07:50 Jamaican castor oil will save you
5377 2018-01-14 19:07:49 @SecretaryZinke I spent many happy summers on the Jersey Shore. Your proposal to drill for oil off the coast of NJ is very likely to mean an end to happy summers there, as well as to decimate the local tourist economy. Who wins here? The oil companies? Shame on you!
5378 2018-01-14 19:07:14 Hate those terrible towels especially in my face at Lucas Oil Stadium.  Could care less if I ever see another one again.  
5379 2018-01-14 19:07:13 Butter instead of oil but otherwise yes.
5380 2018-01-14 19:07:11 I have coconut oil @Tyro_M , please fix !
5381 2018-01-14 19:07:09 Tin scented oil di cheiba?
5382 2018-01-14 19:07:00 Not an oil, but green tea
5383 2018-01-14 19:06:59 We are doing plenty now.  Fracking has given us access to so much oil and natural gas that we are once again net exporters of energy, instead of having to rely on shady middle eastern regimes as we did in the 1970’s.  Nuclear is also a great source of energy.

5392 2018-01-14 19:06:07 There's lots of studies suggesting that fish oil in pill form isn't effective. For some reason it appears it only works when consumed as part of the fish itself. Not conclusive, but that's what most (legitimate) research suggests.
5393 2018-01-14 19:06:03 yum, oil paint on an oak canvas!

5396 2018-01-14 19:05:30 Have you tried olive oil?
5397 2018-01-14 19:05:26 Fish oil is a great idea. Make sure your vitamin d level is good too--if you're not supplementing, take at least 2000 units per day.
Major thing also--make sure your sleep is good. Key problem I often find in my patients.
5398 2018-01-14 19:05:24 I don't support Chelsea Manning either. But the President seems to believe anyone from a foreign country that isn't white or sitting on a hotbed of oil comes from a shithole country.
5399 2018-01-14 19:05:18 Looking likely at the moment everywhere seems to think its on. Just petrified the Oil men go fuck it and throw the bid in
5400 2018-01-14 19:05:11 Protip: If you're super nice to the people who do your oil change, they will knock down an hour-half wait to about 20 minutes.
5401 2018-01-14 19:05:10 How did you get on with the CBD oil? I have heard first hand that it has completely taken away anxiety and depression. It sounds like the key is using it for a few weeks and starting low and upping the dosage until suddenly... happy and calm but not high and doped.
5402 2018-01-14 19:05:10 No one can know for sure but another reason why she may not have left earlier when things went bad is she felt threatened because he’s in a position of power and her job depends on access (photographer right?)

5406 2018-01-14 19:04:18 you need to drink oil too
5407 2018-01-14 19:04:16 Who has a 2013 Nissan Altima Sedan and what oil do u put in it???
5408 2018-01-14 19:04:08 If you let it soak in water for 30 minutes it helps to soften it. Dry well and sauté with olive oil, garlic paste salt and pepper. Finished with some parmigiana.
5409 2018-01-14 19:04:07 do you now see the difference between "social" and "conservative"? They're being sharply desegregated. Like oil&water.

5414 2018-01-14 19:03:31 My takeaways (which no one asked for) 1) It wasn’t sexual assault 2) he was still an unperceptive tool. 3) He put her in a bad situation 4) She could’ve handled said situation better
5415 2018-01-14 19:03:27 Liverpool bossed City, scores some great goals and is a massive help for the top 4 race. It’s also nice beating a former league 2 team that most of your current squad still aren’t really sure who they are playing for apart from a pay day. #oil#freestadium#chequebookclub.
5416 2018-01-14 19:03:25 I made myself a grilled cheese sandwich with so much Brie in it and then fried it in coconut oil. It is a thing of beauty.
5417 2018-01-14 19:03:19 The numbers above are conservative. But the company is not only selling oil, they're drilling + they are also refining oil from neighboring oil producers, which alos adds value. A big player in the Russian market wanted to buy the company for 31.67m just saying
5418 2018-01-14 19:03:06 My Civic hates me and refuses to upload the image.  I think I have an oil change coming up soon.  It'll be a good time to see how helpful those Helpful Honda Dealers are willing to be.

5422 2018-01-14 19:02:32 He sure likes the idea of drilling for oil off our coast and exempts Florida (Mar Lago) from it in his proposal.
5423 2018-01-14 19:02:25 The  price of oil has hit $70 a barrel for the first time since 2014. OPEC accounts for 40% of  the world's output. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with London-based Think Markets says there are 3 major factors driving prices up: a supply cut, stability in demand & Aramco IPO.

5434 2018-01-14 19:00:48 Thanks for the kind words. How did you hear about the book? Have you read it's prequel Oil, Politics, and Violence?
5435 2018-01-14 19:00:44 I think it's a buy - QC, the ship in jun 2017 was 240.232 boe at net 30.9$ to UEN. The shipment in October was 193,550 boe at net 45.08 to UEN and if the company provide another shipment of at least 220,000 @ say $15 boe when oil = $60 (in June)  = $9.9 mill = half market cap.

Go ahead now and sell united Alexis Sanches. They need him to at least have a shot at challenging city for the premier league. #COYG

5443 2018-01-14 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
5444 2018-01-14 19:00:04 So, you appear to be advocating for the taxes instead of innovating transportation that negates the need to have oil. That’s regressive thinking, which is the hole point of my tweet.

5447 2018-01-14 18:59:58 You really want to get into a fundamental argument tsxman? Try doing it against Jimboman. Of course you won't. You just troll him, and block him because you know if you get into fundamentals with him, you'll end up losing. Bottom line, US. oil production is here. Enjoy.

5450 2018-01-14 18:59:45 If cooking for just one or two people, I would use a small saucepan a third full of oil, or a wok.  Shallow frying probably wouldn't work unless you made very flat fritters.

Adequate budget provisions should be made for fupre in line with the bill passed by the Senate & assented by the president in Nov 2017
5453 2018-01-14 18:59:19 Factory everything will begin to fade when we run out of oil.  Just like most ways of life as we know it.
5454 2018-01-14 18:59:16 Create an Oil changing game app. If they can complete the levels before their oil is changed they don’t need to pay for it? Thoughts? 
5455 2018-01-14 18:59:11 it will! but if u get urself a deep repair mask & coconut oil for ur hair it’ll be good asap

5460 2018-01-14 18:57:52 Does anyone ever measure out ‘a tablespoon of oil’ when a recipe calls for it?
5461 2018-01-14 18:57:48 It is kale and it is good for you.  Trim out the stalks and slice thin and either saute it with some oil and garlic and grapes and sausage, or add it trimmed and sliced thin to soups or stews or lentils or rice or whatever.  They say it makes good kale chips.  They are wrong.

5464 2018-01-14 18:57:23 It works, if you remember to take it:-) more sleep helps me, as well as working on word games. I am going on 73, and still am doing well with the old noggin. If you take Fish Oil, look for the burpless brand. Otherwise, you keep tasting fish.

5466 2018-01-14 18:57:11 But raising rates would only work by depressing activity, job creation etc. Surely a bad thing, when inflation from oil prices is only temporary
5467 2018-01-14 18:57:07 trump & his cohorts wanted one change in the GOP Platform, to soften its stance on America’s Sanctions on Russian Oil sales.

5472 2018-01-14 18:56:44 Kamala, what you should be doing is fighting for legislation to stop leasing and revoke drilling permits. This land is our land, not the world oil markets'! #climatechange
5473 2018-01-14 18:56:42 God wouldn’t have created the dinosaurs   and all the other things that have died to make up our precious god given black gold if he didn’t want us to extract it.  Millions of years ago God was forward thinking enough to create the process of making oil so we need to use it!!
5474 2018-01-14 18:55:44 Oil companies can now drill in areas that were protected threatening our coastlines. Construction regs reduced in hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and flood areas which endangers lives.  Reduces illegal immigration. How? By being the worst POTUS ever!! 3/
5475 2018-01-14 18:55:41 Islam now enriched by oil revenues, in control of the heroin trade, and armed with nuclear weapons, Islam can no longer be ignored. We each must understand the origin, agenda, and methods of this movement aggressively committed to our destruction.

5482 2018-01-14 18:53:38 During the winter I do it often like before I wash my hair, I’ll mix it with oil & let that sit for 30 mins or more (once a week) I have a mixture I made with ACV & water I’ll spray on my scalp like before bed if it starts getting dry before wash day
5483 2018-01-14 18:53:34 Canola Oil get so many rts and is selling copper so I don’t see ur point fat fuck
5484 2018-01-14 18:53:32 Try adaptogenic mushroom coffee (lion’s mane/chaga) a small amount if MCT oil, and a bit of unsalted grass fed butter for a breakfast beverage.  Lots of other things but a great place to start.
5485 2018-01-14 18:53:28 Its menopausal sympton. Better than fish oil is Flaxseed oil capsules.  Basically same Omega3 in fish oil but is better for heart.  That and exercise will help reduce.  Get used to writing lists now  doesn’t go away fully

5493 2018-01-14 18:52:28 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
5494 2018-01-14 18:52:25 Problem with this viewpoint is that you bypass our energy independence and go right to a non-existent oil spill. Are you perfectly happy using energy from other parts of the planet? Decrease your usage if you want to be a real example.

5510 2018-01-14 18:48:20 @thataylaa hey! Just wanted to share a product that has gotten me through accutane. It’s the Kiehls Midnight Recovery Cleansing Oil. I’d use this after removing makeup at night and I let it sink in for a couple minutes before rinsing!
5511 2018-01-14 18:48:17 Sounds like your hair is very porous which makes it more difficult for moisture to penetrate your shaft? If so, a thicker sealant/oil could do the trick. But tbh our hair differs, and you need to know your own to know what works personally. No 2 heads are alike.

5522 2018-01-14 18:46:29 Still missing the logical solution. Commercially refillable packaging. Low carbon zero plastic pollution creates local jobs and are cheaper for consumers. Also if recycled plastic price was indexed to oil price we could ensure recycled is always cheaper than virgin

5526 2018-01-14 18:45:50 But to judge how Norway would do without oil and gass, look to Sweden and Denmark. Our socities works much the same
5527 2018-01-14 18:45:49 Current order of industrial capitalism; is crumbling in too many places, too dependent on cheap oil which we are running out of.

5540 2018-01-14 18:43:47 Also true. The oil money does help quite a bit, though. Main thing is that these Cosplay Socialists love to hold Norway up as an example w/o knowing the 1st thing about the place & just blame the “center-left” rather than the actual obstacles

5543 2018-01-14 18:42:54 I have the same problem, so I'm watching to see your responses. I was also told about fish oil, but I never tried it.
5544 2018-01-14 18:42:52 I would and I’m sure (falafel are so way to make BAD) but no deep fat fryer. Have they got enough structure to be fried in, say 1cm of oil, and turned?
5545 2018-01-14 18:42:49 Tin foil and coarse salt to scrub it. Rinse, repeat as necessary. Dry, heat, oil, wipe. Always make sure it's completely dry after cleaning. Soap *won't* kill it, but it might need reseasoning more often. I have, um, a few. :-)
5546 2018-01-14 18:42:39 Lol its an oil truck.
5547 2018-01-14 18:42:17 No fiduciary should accept investments in risky fossil fuel stocks. Fossil investments will eventually fall.  While speculators may risk timing market to get out in time, fiduciaries should not be playing timing games. Oil is for gamblers, not investors.

5552 2018-01-14 18:41:42 Google Genie Oil and Syria for starters. Look at the CEOs of that company and you tell me there is no conflict of interest. Thats just for starters. Also...whose brother was put in charge of Haiti's gold industry...there is another conflict of interest too!

You try getting hold of 17000 lts of transformer oil on a saturday. Then pump it into the transformer. Hellova job.
5560 2018-01-14 18:40:32 My dad makes me do my own oil changes on my car. Well the first time I did one I didn’t know what the plug I was pulling went to, and when I pulled it I got oil ALL over me. I don’t think I’ve ever seen my dad laugh so hard.
5561 2018-01-14 18:40:26 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to Rudy. We won't even miss it!
5562 2018-01-14 18:40:22 I'm grateful @jiffylube could bail me out and get me an oil change without an appt.

5588 2018-01-14 18:36:04 Intervention is sometimes necessary, we just shouldn’t be doing stuff in the Middle East based on our oil interests.
5589 2018-01-14 18:36:03 With low oil prices, tourism/healthy fisheries is likely better long term economic drivers.
5590 2018-01-14 18:35:56 I hate waiting for my oil to get changed

5592 2018-01-14 18:35:32 A combination. We have been lucky with oil and hydroelectric. But cooperstion between labour unions and corps, affordable education, progressive taxes, social security, ensuring that both men and women can have creers and raise families is more important

5608 2018-01-14 18:33:43 I'm happy for you. I wish we as a culture didn't enjoy hero worship so much, because heroes fail us. However, the culture exists. And it has victims. I think shedding light on it for others is a good thing.
5609 2018-01-14 18:33:38 This government took a massive amount of oil from my family not to mention all of the land they took nationally and they are self righteous enough to tell everyone to pick themselves up by their bootstraps!
5610 2018-01-14 18:33:20 a lot of CIA "theories" are like this and seem like COINTELPRO or dumb Boomers who never read leaks, think Iran's democratically-elected president couldn't have been ousted by a CIA/MI5 regime for BP oil, hasn't looked at a single "internet" in their lives

5616 2018-01-14 18:32:51 Why do most recipes call for extra virgin olive oil? Is there a slightly sluttier olive oil? Higher in fat, easier in the sack?

5617 2018-01-14 18:32:48 okay I was so drunk last night but why was I able to take off my makeup with coconut oil and all but UNABLE to get out of bed and puke??????????
5618 2018-01-14 18:32:40 it’s actually great for helping reduce breakouts. But if you’re using straight up tea tree oil you have to dilute it. I use the one for the body shop and it works amazing.
5619 2018-01-14 18:32:34 Soo guys today I learned how to put oil on the pan. This is some difficult shit I tell you
5620 2018-01-14 18:32:32 If you love the environment then embrace Cannabis. Almost anything that can be made from Oil can be made from Cannabis.

Cannabis: Is food, fuel, biodegradable, CO2 negative, potent medicine, non-lethal recreation, better than cotton, leaves soil in good condition.
5621 2018-01-14 18:32:25 btw my tip for vegans is that when making baklava you can replace the butter you brush onto each layer of pastry with macadamia oil. i know a lot of recipes say coconut oil, but that means your baklava will change consistency if you put it in the fridge
5622 2018-01-14 18:32:22 I won't deny corruption in Nigeria because I AM aware. Theres corruption everywhere including America too. Don't you know your ppl come to Nigeria and rip us off oil money. I'm not here to argue with you but sometimes you lot need to stop playing victim
5623 2018-01-14 18:32:18 I’ve been on both ends of “didn’t get the hint” and the reality here is everyone would like to believe how they’d react were they in the situation, but it rarely plays out the way one thinks. I was trying to be nice when I sent signals, as was the person who was sending me hints.
5624 2018-01-14 18:32:16 Record longs in Oil with things already looking toppy = violent violent move down - it’ll snap your neck as longs cover

5630 2018-01-14 18:31:57 Ultimately, it comes down to the questioning of someone who actually left the situation with “why didn’t she leave?” If there is ever a question as to why people don’t report abuse, think back to this one question. “Why did the person who left not leave?” That’s what [you] asked.
5631 2018-01-14 18:31:55 The real Manchester City fans must hate these “fans since the oil money” fans with a passion. All over tweet acting like they actually go to games.
5632 2018-01-14 18:31:42 5) Sometimes things happen much quicker than one can react. Refer to 4. That doesn’t mean that whatever happened up to that point was OK (or not OK, as a matter of fact) or that her discomfort is invalidated because she didn’t have ninja-like reflexes and foresight.
5633 2018-01-14 18:31:36 hahaha bloody oil tankers
5634 2018-01-14 18:31:33 I use coconut oil, bentonite clay, a little baking soda, tiny bit of liquid stevia and some peppermint oil!

5637 2018-01-14 18:31:29 1) She actually left. 
2) Aziz has built a reputation around respecting women. 
3) The account clearly states that she, verbally and non-verbally, rejected his aggressiveness. 
4) Because of 2, it was probably jarring to see things escalate the way they did.
5638 2018-01-14 18:31:25 Never heard of cleansing oil before...learned something new today. Would you use this to clean a make up free face or is it more of a make up remover?
5639 2018-01-14 18:31:24 Not quite sure if it’s my best decision or biggest mistake to do my second try at oil painting on a 70x72 canvas 
5640 2018-01-14 18:31:16 The natural hair struggle drives me nuts. Was on Palmer’s coconut and olive oil range, thought it was working, but now scalp so dry. I just don’t know what to do anymore. 
5641 2018-01-14 18:31:09 somebody lied! it does no harm and i drunk the entire bottle! it’s just nasty asf it feels like your drinking a pot of cooking oil & you gone have diarrhea or may throw up but that’s all apart of active labor
5642 2018-01-14 18:30:40 Salty BT is back: I wrote about this very thing two days ago. 

Meh... Now, let's check the new reactions to my resignation post at OIL Forum... This will surely improve my humour today

#Indian_Judiciary & #Police_Authority to intervene, to ensure peace!
5645 2018-01-14 18:30:18 It's palm oil that's not good for us. We get a very tiny amount of an organic 96% nut on our luck mats. It's probably less than half a teaspoon.
5646 2018-01-14 18:30:16 Today is 710 Sunday, Sunday, SUNDAY here at RVR with 25% off concentrate, 15% off cartridges, and 15% off oil accessories. Come stock up!
5647 2018-01-14 18:30:14 Oil can buy you the league, but it can't buy you a crowd, passion or a deserved history.

I have to say, Pep a class act, 1st thing he did was congratulate LFC for a great victory even though that must have stung. Imagine Jose doing the same 

Robertson superb...again

5648 2018-01-14 18:30:04 Should've used the word dilutes instead of dissolves altho, there are micro organisms in the ocean that do feed on oil molecule as demonstrated by the Horizon disaster.

5655 2018-01-14 18:29:12 What are those unnecessary regulations?  Clean air regulations? Clean water regulations? Workplace health and safety regulations? Consumer product safety regs? Oil spill prevention and cleanup regs? Wildlife protection regs?  Hazardous waste disposal regs? . . .

You're a nitwit.

5659 2018-01-14 18:28:35 You allowed participants to consume coconut oil, olive oil and butter as they chose. How did you control for butter group probably consuming more carbs to take the butter, e.g. bread or baked potatoes, which can also affect cholesterol? #TrustMeImADoctor @DrMichaelMosley

5661 2018-01-14 18:28:24 Doesn’t matter. Because when we do we’ll deserve it. When you win it’s plastic oil money
5662 2018-01-14 18:28:15 A great make up remover instead of throw away cotton wool or wipes is the body shop chamomile cleansing oil- it’s wonderful for eye make up
5663 2018-01-14 18:28:10 5) Manhattan location looked into it while doing oil change. Y’all forgot to replace some screws!
5664 2018-01-14 18:28:09 This coconut oil I got for my locs smell so good and you can use it for your body !
5665 2018-01-14 18:28:03 Yes a big club is defined on its history... you build a reputation over time you can’t buy it with oil money 
5666 2018-01-14 18:27:57 It's all about the $$, the sanctions, oil reserves in the Arctic, Exon Mobile.  Follow the $$
5667 2018-01-14 18:27:35 Ohhhhh hahahaha. Ok, so you need to probably reseason it. Go ahead and wash it in warm, soapy water, wipe it dry (my mom always would heat it on the stovetop to make sure it’s dry). Then coat in veggie oil inside and out.

5673 2018-01-14 18:27:00 Being a dude
5674 2018-01-14 18:26:57 Because tribalism and bipartisanship are like oil and water.

Also it is imperative that tribalists not recognize things like blatant racism (not to mention sexual assault et al) amongst the tribe.
5675 2018-01-14 18:26:54 Same. Just wish we had oil.

5678 2018-01-14 18:26:52 Would buying more oil from Iran or Saudi Arabia be preferable? Suddenly you’re against “Buy American”
5679 2018-01-14 18:26:47 He will create more jobs than any other Pres. Blacks bought more houses ever in 2017 & unemployment lowest ever for Afriamericans as promised! When tax cuts hit economy will go to 5-6% of GDP. We need to be energy independent& sell Nat.Gas to Europe & oil to China & others!
5680 2018-01-14 18:26:37 It's the palm oil in cheaper ones that's not good. We get an organic healthy one with 96% nuts but even then it's a very tiny amount. It's more of a taste than anything.
5681 2018-01-14 18:26:33 Everytime I get my oil changed the SAME dude always gives me him number and a discount on my oil change..
5682 2018-01-14 18:26:33 I don't think they should be there either.  Have you ever walked the beaches around Santa Barbara?  There are tiny oil blobs everywhere.
5683 2018-01-14 18:26:30 Well there is a lot of oil spill inside his dumpy place  french fries oil

5685 2018-01-14 18:26:18 They bought their recent success with oil money, more so than Chelsea. This is a cover for the vast human rights abuses. 

Hard pass. If you're an old fan, I get it, but there's less unsavory options.
5686 2018-01-14 18:26:16 oh hell no ..... but, whatever ......
5687 2018-01-14 18:26:13 Rub it in your scalp combine it with your hot oil treatment. I have scalp psoriasis its like magic
5688 2018-01-14 18:25:53 You can only wash your hair if you want to but dry scalp will lead to a lot of dandruff so always apply small amount of castor oil on the scalp its not noticeable 
P.s take a bath everyday
5689 2018-01-14 18:25:50 It's been a little while, but has anyone written about what, if anything, the closure of AJAM had to do with the collapse in oil prices?
5690 2018-01-14 18:25:43 I said the oil and gas industry has higher standards in NEBC than Alberta does. Btw, that a gift from Australia.  And Australia is a country not located in the Province of British Columbia.  Nor is it located in NEBC.
5691 2018-01-14 18:25:30 no es verdad que se haya recuperado la produccion a 1.9 millones de barriles
5692 2018-01-14 18:25:18 it's kind of funny when an expensive "small batches" oil paint co profiles your work on their site, but you actually can't afford their paint and you mostly use gamblin. (this is a paint nerd tweet with paint nerd shade attached. apologies.)
5693 2018-01-14 18:25:17 I wondered as well.. I just use active charcoal and coconut oil
5694 2018-01-14 18:25:15 I should have been a masseuse! I'd give you a free oil massage. ;)

5696 2018-01-14 18:24:56 I love moisturizing myself with coconut oil oh my. Looking like a beautiful chocolate glazed donut
5697 2018-01-14 18:24:56 No we just have trouble with Wrigley eating any hard food. I thought the coconut oil might help since it’s sweet.
5698 2018-01-14 18:24:26 Quinoa is like rice - it doesn't taste of much so it needs to be cooked in a good stock. After cooking fluff it up with oil & herbs (& lemon juice, garlic, ginger, spring onions if you like). Very nutritious!
5699 2018-01-14 18:24:26 I went to this place called Executive Oil Services. It’s really close to campus (off eastgate) and in pretty sure there’s a discount for a first time patient

5704 2018-01-14 18:23:46 Thank you Senator Feinstein!!!   keep oil rigs off our coast!!! 
5705 2018-01-14 18:23:41 Try a deep conditioner with some olive oil & mayonnaise. But heat up your oils a little first it works wonders!
5706 2018-01-14 18:23:34 That is my exact point as well somebody please tell me where the violation is. I am a date rape Survivor. I did not have the multiple opportunities that this woman had to get up and leave if I could have I would have. I would like someone to break down where he violated her.
5707 2018-01-14 18:23:31 prob also depends on yr hair type & needs— i prefer something that brings out wavy texture & volumizes & gets excess oil out of my hair, which turns limp after like a day of not washing
5708 2018-01-14 18:23:18 Mexican Illegal Aliens send more money home than the country receives in oil revenue! Meanwhile U.S. Taxpayers pay for emergency room care, schools, social services, etc , that they use.

5713 2018-01-14 18:22:26 @TulsiGabbard Thank you For speaking the truth on @ThisWeekABC!! I applaud you for calling out our past admins for their interference toppling world regimes. It is the weapons co’s, gun manufacturers, oil co’s, politicians, etc, lining their pockets at the expense of the ppl.

5718 2018-01-14 18:21:43 If they end up in your waters, my advice: Make them start a financial fund from the very beginning for oil spill clean up. 

Because it's not IF a spill will happen.....it's WHEN?

5722 2018-01-14 18:21:06 I hear ya, I had an Audi as my first car that I bought thru an auction. Ended up costing me way more money than I thought. (Oil changes, Tire Rotation, etc.) ... Look into Scion FRS if you want a BRZ, same car.
5723 2018-01-14 18:21:03 No surprise to see city beaten every now and again the oil heating gets air locked #pepsface #invincibles me arse

5726 2018-01-14 18:20:46 Kale was invented in 2011 to make greens even more unpalatable. They can only be consumed when slathered in oil and salt and baked, i.e., kale chips.

5727 2018-01-14 18:20:35 I’m about to apply the oil to a few things I need the Holy Spirit to address!! Thank you Bishop for the Word of God that you brought forth today!!@themountleads , @TheMountBishop
5728 2018-01-14 18:20:31 So, last night, I was rubbing peppermint oil on my temple to “reduce” the migraine that I had.. right after I did that I went to go pee and by mistake used the hand I had peppermint on.. 
5729 2018-01-14 18:20:09 Everton fans will be shitting it knowing the oil c**** will be coming for big sam.
5730 2018-01-14 18:20:08 I am so glad @Arsenal 's Invincible record remains, because unlike @ManCity' s that team wasn't made from oil money.
5731 2018-01-14 18:20:01 Oil is a curse. Rest in peace. #iraniansailors
5732 2018-01-14 18:19:53 Or, who knows, we could just stop turning the lights on. Or growing the food. Or pumping the oil. Little sht like that.
5733 2018-01-14 18:19:51 Listen LISTEN TO ME

I know that you only do oil changes on Sundays, I was made aware of this fact on Friday when I was CALLED. BUT Y'ALL SAID I COULD COME IN ANYWAY ON SUNDAY FOR MY DAMN TIRES.

I AM UNAVAILABLE FOR THE BS PLEASE DO NOT TELL ME I CAME HERE TO WASTE MY TIME.
5734 2018-01-14 18:19:33 el dialogo no solo es locura y burla es descaro y perversidad partida de coños de nadre irresponsables.
5735 2018-01-14 18:19:30 Coconut oil saving my life today
5736 2018-01-14 18:19:27 Just a heads up. Oil pumps force the oil throughout the engine. warming up as far as wear and tear is concerned takes 10 seconds for cars these days. The warm air you want in a cold area takes longer because the heat from combustion has to heat up gallons of antifreeze
5737 2018-01-14 18:19:16 Trying to memorize lyrics to one Snake Oil song, but it's super kicking my butt.

5740 2018-01-14 18:18:57 We'll see. The major oil companies have been ripping off the citizens for years while making huge profits. Retail gas is too high right now.
5741 2018-01-14 18:18:54 Just arrived back from Abu Dhabi on time before the green boys take over during Sustainability Week..Oil and gas still flows in my vains #OOTT #ACEnergyforum

5743 2018-01-14 18:18:37 Is Goldman Sachs involved Aramco IPO ? Then oil price will continue to rally beyond 2018..
5744 2018-01-14 18:18:33 Sometimes God will rub his oil upon your life, and when the enemy comes he can’t get a grip and you slip away.
5745 2018-01-14 18:18:12 Hmmm, I'm not sure. It is made from oil which is a liquid I think

5747 2018-01-14 18:18:06 In Ontario the contracts for most gas generators built in past 20 years pay net revenue requirements and claw back revenues above fuel costs.
Probably true of biomass generators, and Lennox (oil/gas) too.
they are paid regardless of output- preference if for them not to operate
5748 2018-01-14 18:18:02 Does not want oil spills in front of his property.
5749 2018-01-14 18:17:55 If you experience hair fall because of dandruff use saeed ghani products.
As far as I know there is no permanent solution to dandruff, use olive oil twice a week and apply castor oil on the scalp after washing your hair this slows down dandruff formation

5757 2018-01-14 18:15:52 ... who has never had a real job, faked a Master's and 100s of hours volunteering on his resume, edited resume to remove time working at the family snake oil firm when it was selling illegal drugs (daddy got convicted). Predecessors were decades older with distinguished resumes.

5759 2018-01-14 18:15:22 He was a just a puppet. Too stupid to have an opinion.  I saw a post talking about suffering. Since when did you have to suffer to become President. The left has been brain washed by a snake an oil medicine man.
5760 2018-01-14 18:15:22 Would recommend buying shares in Olbas oil, the amount I'm getting through.
5761 2018-01-14 18:15:11 Regulations were there for good reasons. Those reasons did not go away. The regulations you are removing will cause more oil spills, harm more people, hurt our environment and make the rich richer. 
When those things start happening again, we can all point the finger at you.
5762 2018-01-14 18:14:50 There’s something abt changing your  oil, drinking beer, and then watching your team in the playoffs.

5768 2018-01-14 18:14:43 Man City, the team people only started supporting after the oil money came in. Forever plastic.
5769 2018-01-14 18:14:38 Rooting 4 the Jags today just cause my Boys bestfriend is Koyack and he's from Oil City
5770 2018-01-14 18:14:37 Nebosh  only oil and gas minds know what that is 
5771 2018-01-14 18:14:23 If the world's scientific community got behind this and it captures the public's attention....   Could (& should) be a game changer.. 
But when you're up against Big Oil and moneyed interests.. The opposition will be strong..
5772 2018-01-14 18:14:20 im sorry not trying to be rude? but have you looked into cbd oil?
5773 2018-01-14 18:14:11 In the oil and gas industry we use a guard over critical buttons to prevent accidental activation. Often this is a simple as a cover that has to be lifted off the button requiring 2 actions to allow activation. Simple but effective. #askDad
5774 2018-01-14 18:13:56 I think it is fair  to say that too high a price will equal too much oil .
5775 2018-01-14 18:13:20 Ethanol hasn't been subsidized since 2011 and the money was going to oil companies for blending ethanol in, not to the farmer.

5778 2018-01-14 18:12:45 Ran out of canola oil. Still need to make dressings and marinades. *substitutes white wine* I REFUSE to step foot back in a grocery store for at least the next 2 weeks.
5779 2018-01-14 18:12:38 Our credit rating was downgraded due to the oil price and not the government. Stop trying to make everything political. It's really annoying. Some things are not controlled by politicians.
5780 2018-01-14 18:12:27 Hello Vinnie!! I just brought home some coconut oil from Costco. How much do you recommend adding to my morning coffee? @VinnieTortorich

5792 2018-01-14 18:11:13 lol that's cause you eliminated the tax to cover OIL SPILL CLEANUPS THAT THE PRODUCERS WERE  REQUIRED TO PAY. 9¢/BARREL MUST'VE REALLY BEEN PLACING A HARDSHIP ON THEM.
5793 2018-01-14 18:11:12 Oil money can only go so far
5794 2018-01-14 18:11:02 Science : Pimples are caused due to excessive oil in your skin.

Well I'm done with your stupidity.  Buhbuy.

5806 2018-01-14 18:09:59 Yes, please step aside for my preferred candidate Nigel Butterbottom, who will wear a #metoo pin while voting to turn Nebraska into the world's biggest vice so they can squeeze the poor and turn them into oil
5807 2018-01-14 18:09:48 Occurs to me that, if I ever owned a grocery store, I'd shelf baby oil next to olive oil just to mess with people. #mischief #DarwinAwards #whoneedsblieapron
5808 2018-01-14 18:09:48 Every year, Trade for 19-20 cents a mile. Around 20k miles a year on average. For 4K a year to me it’s a no brainer. No tires, no maintenance, free oil changes.
5809 2018-01-14 18:09:46 Pero i told you oil rig 
5810 2018-01-14 18:09:43 The gospel is the snake oil cure, but first you have to convince your marks that they are sick and deserve to be tortured after they die.
5811 2018-01-14 18:09:22 Wages are high in ND because they have a huge oil and gas industry.  You can't dispute that the blue States and cities pay for everybody else.  It's just facts.  I know,  I know, they couldn't be facts if they don't jive with GOP talking points.
5812 2018-01-14 18:09:18 Keep tweeting this. This needs to be known. These are the early victims of oil drilling off our coastal waters!
5813 2018-01-14 18:09:14 Occasionally. Not usually. People do volunteer to help others because it's meaningful and impactful and the right thing to do. Cannabis oil doesn't work on cynicism, eh?

5816 2018-01-14 18:09:13 Irrelevant oil money club. Remove De Bruyne and you all will be playing in the championship. Citizen is just a fake name and it sounds cringey as fuck. Fake club trying so hard to be real. Don't ever disrespect Arsenal again by calling yourself the new Invisibles. Frauds.

5818 2018-01-14 18:08:40 What about Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Libya, Mozambique, Malawi, Niger, Congo, Liberia, etc., and Haiti?

Lot's of successful Nigerians in the US, many because of oil industry and our medical schools.

Thank's for showing Trump's idea for a merit based immigration system has merit
5819 2018-01-14 18:08:40 I believe they are owned by Lucas Oil, who is definitely into the online streaming game and share the same programming.
5820 2018-01-14 18:08:32 Good because there is already traces of oil in the sand of some of our beaches. We do not need more.
5821 2018-01-14 18:08:22 Hate getting my oil changed. I hope that shit really 5 minutes
5822 2018-01-14 18:08:10 "Truth may be stretched, but cannot be broken, and always gets above falsehood, as does oil above water." - Miguel de Cervantes
5823 2018-01-14 18:07:57 Sign the petition: Tell Trump's Interior Department: No new oil drilling on our coasts! Sign here: Please sign. The Gulf of Mexico was nearly destroyed once and is still recovering from millions of gallons of oil lying on the sea floor and chocking off all life.
5824 2018-01-14 18:07:52 Get rid of the old seasoning, wash it, dry it thoroughly (oven or stove top). Once cool, pour some flaxseed oil in and lightly coat every surface. Then wipe the pan out thoroughly with a paper towel. Bake at 500 for an hour. Cool. Repeat oil-bake-cool until done.

5830 2018-01-14 18:07:06 it's coconut oil *only* for me. I only use lotion from bbw if i wanna use it as a smell good feature or just give me a lil extra moisture. coconut oil usually takes care of me though.
5831 2018-01-14 18:07:03 The USA  will be drilling more oil soon!!! Hopefully we can stop importing oil from other countries altogether!!! Energy independence helps make MAGA possible!! 
5832 2018-01-14 18:07:02 I haven't seen that at all. "Assault" seems to be the term most are arguing about.
5833 2018-01-14 18:06:40 Great to see a new direction from the "price of the barrel of oil" The electric vehicles are coming regardless what the politicians and "old boys club "are saying!
5834 2018-01-14 18:06:24 Ugly? Apart from it not being in the slightest bit true (or indeed, a sane thing to think) her other half's no effing oil painting.
5835 2018-01-14 18:06:19 Few things freak me out as much as misued quotation marks, especially in a business setting. Oil change place had "You Stay In Your Car!" On their building. Do I stay in my car or is that innuendo for me being locked in a basement? I don't know...
5836 2018-01-14 18:06:15 A barrel of oil was sold for $147 in PDP era but sold for $27 in APC era
5837 2018-01-14 18:06:14 haaaaaa! Move over coconut oil and veganuary! 
5838 2018-01-14 18:06:12 What oil stock will increase the most PPS over next 30 days?
5839 2018-01-14 18:06:10 I live in Santa Barbara.  I have not heard him mention one word about all the lives lost and the others still missing!  He’s not concerned about us, golf’s more important!  He’ll let us know when he drills for oil though, esp. when he complains about the cost of CA oil cleanups!
5840 2018-01-14 18:05:55 Coconut oil is my saviour
5841 2018-01-14 18:05:41 Oh sorry. Well of course.
North Sea oil is running out for Scotland, so you have to find an alternative revenue.
Norways fiscally smart and along with Australia didn't have a recession 2009. They're economy actually grew  3%.
There's a rumour they will become a tech centre
5842 2018-01-14 18:05:38 City has no fans? They only have an oil rig... tell em @markgoldbridge
5843 2018-01-14 18:05:33 "I need someone to help me oil up."
5844 2018-01-14 18:05:30  it's funny because when i started supporting them in 2011 i had no idea about the oil money.

Just loved the squad they put together with it 

Plus i was the GOAT with them in fifa
5845 2018-01-14 18:05:27 Isn’t it strange that such a fuss is made over a few cents Ctax, ( which will do many good things ) but virtually no mention of oil companies profiteering with fifteen cent price hikes?
5846 2018-01-14 18:05:20 Just made myself some hot chili oil.. gonna try to make myself some kimchi, wish me luck
5847 2018-01-14 18:05:14 Any Reports from Las Vegas Oil? Everyone snoozing?
5848 2018-01-14 18:05:09 Pruitt should have never been confirmed in the first place.  He is in the pockets of oil and coal and is clearly an anti environmentalist.  Get him out!
5849 2018-01-14 18:04:47 Im a Dem, but I saw straight through HRC's bullshit while her loser hubby was in office...a lot of us have.  O was an MF, too.  I'm starting to realize there's not a lot of diff bet parties.  The same folks sign ALL their checks, including  Big Oil donors&Saudis.  shame

5851 2018-01-14 18:04:31 Worries about US shale output as oil hits 3-year high...
5852 2018-01-14 18:04:23 Admirably gutsy and righteous, our nations greatest cities getting hard-nosed with big oil putting blame for devastation where it belongs. Yeah! Make good use of those tax cut $$$ so generously provided by our president.
5853 2018-01-14 18:04:13 Needed for what? To have soldiers die away from their families in counties that only have a handful of Islamic extremists? To create new governments in place of old ones that fail anyways? To go to war for oil? Our military doesn't need anymore spending you fool.
5854 2018-01-14 18:04:06 Yeah, the oil's just a stopgap measure until I can run and grab traps and such! Thanks for the tips!

5872 2018-01-14 18:01:33 Xhaka is a passer but he’s as slow as an oil tanker. AW is attack minded and don’t see City with an out and out DM either so we see what happens

5874 2018-01-14 18:01:12 welldone @LFC fck the oil money

5884 2018-01-14 18:00:49 Oil prices are soaring again right now - wait a few months until the extra tens of billions of dollars in revenue start flowing through the system again .

5888 2018-01-14 18:00:37 Trump knows the consequences that’s why he wouldn’t want any oil spills in front of Mar a Lago or any of his other trump properties along Florida’s coast line.
5889 2018-01-14 18:00:29 It would be intesting to hear the "whole" story about what hapened there. Remember he volanteered to be a part of the enforcers of oil company's interests.

5897 2018-01-14 17:59:40 Lol me and football are like oil and water.
5898 2018-01-14 17:59:37 Big oil.... how?
5899 2018-01-14 17:59:27 False. You obviously have spent no time in OKLA, a shithole state, due to under taxation of oil and gas so we have little funding for schools, infrastructure.

5903 2018-01-14 17:59:02 Some things are just meant to be - this oil soaked team of riches can’t hold a torch to the greatest club side this country has ever produced #Invincibles
5904 2018-01-14 17:59:00 Oh my flakes and oil. The cats are making these weird sounds. Like they're a bunch of kids crying for no apparent reason. Make them staaaaaaaaaaaaaahp!
5905 2018-01-14 17:58:54 GWB had exactly the same shit resume from his business experience that Trump did. Namely, running a ‘can’t lose’ business into the fucking ground! In his case it was oil, in Trumps case it was fucking casinos during the biggest boom in gaming history!
5906 2018-01-14 17:58:51 As long as you are not invincible League trophy is just a trophy and we got those plenty more than oil mines

5908 2018-01-14 17:58:22 Does that include oil, gas, and minerals? All those pipelines in the news involving Canadian companies.
5909 2018-01-14 17:58:21 Where u get the oil for it? I need a cartridge
5910 2018-01-14 17:58:21 You are really something! So you approve building bird cruncher windmills because oil spills kill birds too? Oil spills are nasty accidents. So we agree that building windmills is an accident too. You can change that accident from happening: STOP BUILDING WINDMILLS.
5911 2018-01-14 17:58:21 Any of the three persons.
5912 2018-01-14 17:58:15 Best thing about the City loosing today, Arsenal keep their invincible title. The invincible title should never be bought with oil money.
Worst thing about the City loosing today is that there are no fans to banter.

5914 2018-01-14 17:57:51  You didn't list Palm Oil and Bitter Kola lmao. I am worried Wenger is stylishly punishing us for the WengerOut banners last season. We ve gone from terribly bad to worse. Can I join Man City now. I think not.
5915 2018-01-14 17:57:51 i’m 4k miles over my needed oil change ...
5916 2018-01-14 17:57:29 There’s a lot more of them that are toxic to animals please do research on whatever oil you have and see if it is safe to use around your pets xx
5917 2018-01-14 17:57:24 Good covering of avocado oil or coconut oil so the eggs don't stick. Lift the edges to let the portions that haven't been cooked under the egg party

5920 2018-01-14 17:56:59 Respect @Arsenal invincible season. @ManCity with all the oil monies can’t do 24 games without a loss. Congratulations to @Arsenal for keeping our record

5923 2018-01-14 17:56:38 If ya having a bad day, cover it in the blood of Jesus or coconut oil. One of them shit fix it.
5924 2018-01-14 17:56:38 It’s time to invest in clean renewable energy, the sad thing is the oil they are so greedily after is not even meant for American markets.  They want to pump as much as they can as fast as they can to sell overseas.
5925 2018-01-14 17:56:34 @InjectionMoldGA ...Oil is a commodity, a resource, & a TOOL. Yes a tool, much like a hammer, or screw driver, or wrench.

5930 2018-01-14 17:55:50 Yeah, it's not 100% butter. To make a butter spreadable they need to add an oil to it. So those spreadable Lurpak and Butro spreads have added oils. I know Lurpak adds Rapeseed oils to make it spreadable. They aren't cheap unfortunately
5931 2018-01-14 17:55:48 Mr. President, you have no need to state this. We know your charity donates about 90 percent of what it receives. It doesn’t pay for 6 foot tall oil paintings of yourself or pay itself rent for fundraisers. It’s a shame, you would’ve made a great “First Man” to President Clinton.

5958 2018-01-14 17:53:10 Obama watched it alright. He said the right things while smiling meanwhile bombing the hell out of the Middle East behind the scenes. Went after whistleblowers, expanded gov spying, bailed the banks, and fucked over Native Americans with the oil pipes.
5959 2018-01-14 17:53:09 Revoked a rule that expanded the number of people who could earn overtime pay

5961 2018-01-14 17:53:00 has come to look at it. Beyond oil palm and mushroom, Abia State has acquired two rice mills, because we don’t need to take our rice (117/253)

5964 2018-01-14 17:52:55 palm or something that will yield money, because we must cultivate every available space with oil palm. It is really a big shame that (111/253)
5965 2018-01-14 17:52:55 phase is to replace every old palm tree, with exotic one, it’s our policy that our flowers, ornamental trees, all of them must be oil (110/253)
5966 2018-01-14 17:52:52 Yea right we need oil
5967 2018-01-14 17:52:51 said well, in the interim, let us cultivate to full capacity. In doing that, we will require the exotic tenneral specie of oil palm, (106/253)

5972 2018-01-14 17:52:40 Joking aside, those ancient persons would have loved to have been “exploited” by big oil. Their lives would have been longer and more pleasant.
5973 2018-01-14 17:52:32 my skins combination and i dont feel like its too oily. its possible ur skin is lacking in hydration and compensating by producing excess oil so a super hydrating one like this might benefit, but def ask and try a sample bc they obv kno more than me!
5974 2018-01-14 17:52:27 Very different world, no?  (Ie China was nowhere near world's biggest oil importer then but is now, EM's in total were nowhere near the majority of global GDP as they are now, etc.)
5975 2018-01-14 17:52:22 Never birds have been killed by oil spills, everyone knows that.
5976 2018-01-14 17:52:14 I like SM stuff a lot but never have thought their fragrances were all natural for the same reason. “Essential oil blend” is misleading, I agree!

5983 2018-01-14 17:51:32 Yes. Make a potatoe mash, season well. Slice up the kale coarsely and stirfry for a minute in a littlevolive oil. It still needs ‘a bite’. Mix with the mash. Great with sausage, meatballs or a hachee. Glass of Pinot noir. Or a bottle.
5984 2018-01-14 17:51:31 It’s still happening!Why do you think the PTB freak when we talk about leaving the UN? Why are they postponing Brexit? Why are they removing countries with independent gold backed currency ala Libya? Saddam messed the petro$ with oil - hence the war- we are winning but still here
5985 2018-01-14 17:51:26 Lol! I just mix Shea butter, coconut oil, olive oil, honey and castor oil and use for every part; skin, face and hair.
5986 2018-01-14 17:51:21 My recommend is to strip the thick stem out, slice it really thin, and toss it with olive oil and lemon juice and salt and pepper. Let it sit for a few hours which will soften it up and then add some awesome olives and grilled chicken or steak with some fresh parm

5993 2018-01-14 17:50:27 Yeah only use a small amount of tea tree oil like 2-3 drops
5994 2018-01-14 17:50:24 Yes! It’s great as a salad with just olive oil, salt, and lemon juice tossed all over.
5995 2018-01-14 17:50:13 Oil fuckoff
5996 2018-01-14 17:50:08 all bullshit in fact as gas oil coal electricity keep going up

6002 2018-01-14 17:49:36 I got two of their kits which are good value for money. I’m obsessed with their dry shampoo and I’m trying the hair oil tonight
6003 2018-01-14 17:49:34 I woke today to the smell of sesame oil, which was nice but made me rush to the kitchen to see if the cats had been poking around in the cupboard again.
6004 2018-01-14 17:49:26 I saw a chick implying that beard oil is like makeup...
When y'all get that retarde

6006 2018-01-14 17:49:13 Daniel, would you attribute the decline through 2016 as mostly a mechanical effect of lower oil prices reducing the $-value of the industry, or a real shift in drilling activity etc.?
6007 2018-01-14 17:49:03 Norway has achieved this because of their North Sea oil. It has HUGE sovereign wealth funds from selling oil. It's easy to have all those green checkmarks when your country is oil-stinking rich.
6008 2018-01-14 17:49:01 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?

6010 2018-01-14 17:48:53 Remember dinosaurs at old Sinclair gas stations decades ago? Are you familiar wSinclairBroadcastingCompany? If I needed to cover up an Iranian oil tanker, described as being 10times Exxon Valdez was sinking to the bottom of the ocean that we will share... A button is a great idea

6015 2018-01-14 17:47:41 Seeing as how chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas live inside the urethra, I’m not sure how lubricating your skin helps protect you from those.  And I don’t recall ever reading any studies saying coconut oil protects you from AIDS.
6016 2018-01-14 17:47:30 Anfield proved to be too much for the oil merchants, but as usual, the condition of the defence and goalkeeping leaves a bitter aftertaste.

6021 2018-01-14 17:47:01 It's a plot. "The Jew" wants to empty out the island out and convert the Arecibo radio telescope to a HAARP weather modification system, and hold the oil companies hostage. I read this on the innernet.
6022 2018-01-14 17:46:52 Kid in oil change shop told me last chance "My filter was dangerously dirty and I needed a new one" now "it needs to be changed by my next oil change" just change the oil Daquan

6025 2018-01-14 17:46:38 Now just imagine an oil rig off to your right..
6026 2018-01-14 17:46:34 With all the Oil that you use in New York, No Drilling, No Oil.
6027 2018-01-14 17:46:31 Same place you were buying physical oil, right ?
6028 2018-01-14 17:46:29 I think i lost my oil pen last night, it’s a sad sad day.
6029 2018-01-14 17:46:29 If by oil you mean Arimis then fine 
6030 2018-01-14 17:46:26 Takes a special team to do it undefeated. Especially without oil money.
6031 2018-01-14 17:46:06 It’s honestly the worst. I once creamed my body with it, and went out with leggings, the leggings absorbed the oil and I walked around with what looked like a wet patch on my bum all day
6032 2018-01-14 17:45:58 Good article . Film clip was good however ...still mAke believe. 1. Penn is NOT that tall . 2. His reaction to soldiers death is BS, he would be blaming Bush or Big Oil , etc would not be upset , too selfish to think of others. Good acting on his part.
6033 2018-01-14 17:45:51 Oil, butter and meat fat/juices.
6034 2018-01-14 17:45:50 Oil can what?
6035 2018-01-14 17:45:50 ''Historically, coconut oil is ones of the earlist oils to be used as a food and as pharmaceutical. Ayurvedic literatura has long promoted the health and cosmetic benefits of coconut oil'' Fife Bruce
6036 2018-01-14 17:45:40 Electricity is needed to refine oil, and then you burn more fuel moving it to gas stations. Not to mention my AC induction motor is far more efficient than ICE, over 80% vs 17-21% energy to the wheel.
6037 2018-01-14 17:45:36 After you cut spicy peppers with your bare hands, put a little neutral cooking oil (canola, vegetable) on your hands and rub it around, then wash with dish soap.
6038 2018-01-14 17:45:08 I ordered a new straightener (I dropped mine) a new iPad case-mine has been naked since October, and some camellia oil

6047 2018-01-14 17:43:44 Obama usually doesn't sell snake oil. He's only exaggerated twice I can think of and no time where he wasn't trying his level best to keep his promise.
6048 2018-01-14 17:43:31 Thanks Shana! I do on my instagram: thesmilingcook! This recipe is so easy! Layer olive oil, onions, sliced eggplant, Parmesan-reggiano, tomatoes, basil, and garlic then top with mozzarella and bake on 350 until eggplant is soft & it’s bubbling!
6049 2018-01-14 17:43:13 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.

6051 2018-01-14 17:43:04 A couple of other customers are browsing, letting Charles collect his portion of the supplies.

He gets a lantern and a couple of bottles of lamp oil, a box of matches and a pair of small pots to heat water and warm food.

Setting that on the counter, he goes back to grab ~

6053 2018-01-14 17:42:59 @sybilverity Also save yourself the grief of grating garlic, chilli, ginger & onion by sticking it all in a food processor with the oil to make a paste.
6054 2018-01-14 17:42:55 it needs shed loads of stuff thrown at it before it tastes of anything. Olive oil, Lemon zest and parsley, salt and pepper, and you might be able to eat it...
6055 2018-01-14 17:42:44 I think Threads has the edge.
Back in the 'Cold War' 80s, Chester with the proximity of oil refinery, steel works, Capenhurst nuclear reprocessing, Marconi missile factory, RAF Sealand, British Aerospace, Liverpool's water treatment works at Huntington - would cease to exist...

6058 2018-01-14 17:42:01 The president and the Republican party don't want to admit climate change because they're wealthy Oil Company donors would get upset. When the climate change's and our food supply runs out I hope they choke on their money.
6059 2018-01-14 17:42:00 Maybe Sanchez would like to play for a real Club with history and a passionate fan base rather than a team built with oil money who can’t fill a stadium
6060 2018-01-14 17:41:50 What kind of oil and where can I get it?
6061 2018-01-14 17:41:48 See as Liverpool just dey oil Man City like say na Yoruba Stew!!!

6070 2018-01-14 17:40:45 I thought the oil money team would go unbeaten after the HUGE money spent...expecting a real crisis. We'll see the real Sterling, Sane, Delph, Fernandinho and more average players there...
Back in the #TITLERACE #GGMU
6071 2018-01-14 17:40:44 And just a little bit of olive oil
6072 2018-01-14 17:40:42 I heard in a private meeting with select financial people she told them she wanted only 100 oil companies left. She's nearly done it.
6073 2018-01-14 17:40:38 Done:)
6074 2018-01-14 17:40:33 NO AMOUNT of fish will EVER replace the profits from oil, that was what I meant.

6078 2018-01-14 17:40:27 The oil used for anointing in the Old Testament came from the olive. The olive has to be pressed and squeezed for the oil to flow. You will be pressed and squeezed when you are anointed.

6083 2018-01-14 17:40:06 Not to mention the fact his friends could soon be sticking oil drilling rigs in that beautiful view.  I saw, DRILL OFF FLORIDA!
6084 2018-01-14 17:39:55 I am a wealthy man. I have a house in the woods sitting above a vast oil field. I never visit it and the caretaker is aging, infirm, and also losing his sight. If and when I show up the house might be a wreck. But the house is irrelevant, it’s really about the oil -SK
6085 2018-01-14 17:39:47 My windshield cracked today. So now I have to fix the body damage, the windshield, flush the brakes, and get an oil change. I love spending 1200 on my car.

6088 2018-01-14 17:39:21 Coconut oil works fine...
6089 2018-01-14 17:39:19 Baloney. It’s one of the plays that is killing the price for natural gas and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is gas prone. The provincial government should stop Duvernay operators from giving gas away to get at the oil and liquids.
6090 2018-01-14 17:39:17 I’m firmly on the cast iron bandwagon. Rules I’ve learned: it’s ok to use soap, just don’t scour the pan. Use a little vegetable oil when you’re done to reseason. You have to untrained your brain of everything you’ve learned about pan cleaning.
6091 2018-01-14 17:39:16 niiiice! i do love a bit of pineapple on pizza! we have this cool jazzy place where I live and I discovered they do this paprika flavored oil and it goes super nicely with a plain mozzarella!
6092 2018-01-14 17:39:12 concept: a sans-therapist massage. you go into a room with beautiful music and dim lighting and calming scents and a heated bed and scented eye pillow, slather yourself in oil and just nap for a while

6106 2018-01-14 17:37:06 Man shittys oil money can’t help them now!!
6107 2018-01-14 17:36:57 It was in the context of people moving from in to out, and producing top shelf flower.

Our climate will be an issue. It is why most climate sensitive crops are grown under glass at this latitude.

I definitely believe in OD long term. It will dominate oil production for sure.
6108 2018-01-14 17:36:46 ほんとに？
6109 2018-01-14 17:36:38 @ManCity fans could use some of that oil from their oil fields for lubrication right now.
6110 2018-01-14 17:36:35 The Fulani's are no less humans,the atrocities committed against them in Mambila,Numan and other places should be condemned not this bias and selective outrage,seriously we are loosing confidence in your activism, if others won't voice out I won't remain num.
6111 2018-01-14 17:36:34 TBF, as much as we wanted this result to go our way and despite my hatred for Liverpool, it is good to see Oil City humbled.
6112 2018-01-14 17:36:32 So what do you guys do when you’re waiting for an oil change.

6137 2018-01-14 17:34:24 i did a pretty cool exfoliating mask the other night made with: baking soda, tea tree oil, witch hazel, plain unscented moisturizer, agave, and a couple drops of anti-redness eye drops (which work on skin too!)
6138 2018-01-14 17:34:20 Urban legend, my friend. It's like in the when the tomato was first introduced in Europe and thought to be poisonous. Before tomatoes, the recipe for spaghetti sauce was merely olive oil, goat milk and plague. Do not fear Tide pods. Fear not the fruit of the sea.

6142 2018-01-14 17:33:58 Has the Sanche tank oil been tampered with by the corps of the army and the fire and shaft of new martyrs have been to distract the public and deviate and cover the new revolution? we will see
6143 2018-01-14 17:33:52 Mercer was Bannon's backer until he went off about Trump to a reporter without being smart enough to know what #OffTheRecord or #OnBackground means. He's a huge distraction, so the Kochs love him to pieces. Lets them dismantle oil and timber regulations.

6147 2018-01-14 17:32:55 He isn't exactly an oil painting himself.
6148 2018-01-14 17:32:54 I would love to have a place to change my own oil just to avoid the hassle of saying no to everything the mechanics try to sell me for my car that I can’t afford...  I just want to spend $40 and be on my way
6149 2018-01-14 17:32:53 @ManCity fans could use some of that oil from their oil fields for lubrication right now.

6151 2018-01-14 17:32:50 Sichuan cooking tip: it’s stir-frying the peppers first in the oil that really brings out the spicy nature
6152 2018-01-14 17:32:49 Perhaps he can tell that to the Zionist terrorists next time he has dinner with them, same thing with Erdogan, all talk while selling Iraq-KRG oil to illegal Israel.
6153 2018-01-14 17:32:43 Yeah it’s just been such a long time of being given these meds that don’t work for me so I need to look at another option, gonna try some coconut oil though so let’s see how that works for me

6156 2018-01-14 17:32:28 Expect Pep Guardiola to demand the oil Sheiks give Arsenal whatever they want for Alexis Sanchez. United best get a deal done with the quickness.
6157 2018-01-14 17:32:14 Seismic airguns are used to find oil and gas deep underneath the ocean floor. Airguns are so loud that they disturb, injure or kill marine life, harm commercial fisheries, and disrupt coastal economies.
6158 2018-01-14 17:32:08 Oil money team(@ManCity)pumped for their worth by @LFC 
6159 2018-01-14 17:32:02 Apart from being gratuitously rude and superficial, wondering if you've had a good look in the mirror? You're no oil painting.
6160 2018-01-14 17:31:56 In what universe is this funny? Get bent
6161 2018-01-14 17:31:54 How much was oil when PDP was in power and how much is oil now??

6170 2018-01-14 17:31:00 @TravelLeisure so now there's like two hours left, and I go to inhale hot air with fir oil, and I pass all my audience to you. 

Don't just sit there, do something, don't let them get bored.

They’re just gonna get in the way of your arguments!

6176 2018-01-14 17:30:32 we beat you 5-0 earlier this season.  And we’re 1st place. Oil money is doing good.  Defensive errors is causing this. Enjoy it while it lasts
6177 2018-01-14 17:30:10 I know quite a few coming to the USA as intercompany transfers (oil&gas). Hess, Statoil, ConocoPhillips, etc...
6178 2018-01-14 17:30:10 @ManCity Dis oil ting not gonna last for too long blud

6181 2018-01-14 17:29:34  we just want man city to lose
6182 2018-01-14 17:29:33 Um, why does 45 keep shipping jobs overseas and then go on about job growth? Why did he make promises to coal miners only to kill their protection for when they have black lung? Why didn’t he make Russian sanctions against his boyfriend, the oil mogul, and then buy his pipes? 
6183 2018-01-14 17:29:33 You not beatin a nigga who fix cars for a living in a fight dawg...all dat motor oil residue on his knuckles...nigga prolly loss 1 fight in his entire life

6194 2018-01-14 17:28:41 I admire the culture of USA, the entire world is marked by USA...

Venezuela is an "oil hole" and that is the only thing they want...
Our oil holes...

6202 2018-01-14 17:28:04 Take vitamin D, oil of oregano, garlic gelcaps and cinnamon if you can keep it down.

6207 2018-01-14 17:27:48 Fuck the oil money
6208 2018-01-14 17:27:39 This man will deplete any resource, drill any oil & gas, all for the short gain. There are consequences to those economic decisions. When we have to import everything in 20-30 yrs, how does that help?
6209 2018-01-14 17:27:38 #LIVMCI Oil money vs Hardwork and determination #Liverpool
6210 2018-01-14 17:27:36 Africa has buried Man City with all their oil money. We are not shitholes. Thank you Sallah.

6213 2018-01-14 17:27:28 Being without coconut oil for 2 weeks has been a real issue
6214 2018-01-14 17:27:26 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
6215 2018-01-14 17:27:25 Thank you. I’m not very impressed with that. As very much a lay person but learning the hard way, all this sodding interference by the west and our funding of it has caused millions of deaths, created a refugee crisis and enabled terrorism, all for oil and arms sales. 
6216 2018-01-14 17:27:25 HAHAHAHA WHAT YOU SAYING CITEH FUCK OFF WITH YOUR OIL MONEY TEAM

6221 2018-01-14 17:27:04 Oil money can buy a lot of nice things but it can't buy  3 points at Anfield.

3. and when it became obvious that his prescriptions were snake oil.

6233 2018-01-14 17:26:24 Sit down oil company
6234 2018-01-14 17:25:57 Instead of/in addition to suing oil companies, it'd be ideal if people actually altered their own actions to stop being so dependent on fossil fuels. 

Stop driving. Live closer to where you work. Transportation is the absolute #1 contributor to climate change.
6235 2018-01-14 17:25:54 Take notice @Govinslee we do not want oil rigs in our ocean

Why could not the international law save the #environment from sinking the oil tanker?

6253 2018-01-14 17:24:12 This is a petition against the killing of Nigerians by Herders (Fulani & the likes). If we are sensitive, the focus should be on stamping out evil instead of viewing it from the angle of ethnic coloration. Are the Herders Igbo or Yoruba? I didn’t put up the petition by the way.

6265 2018-01-14 17:23:31 So was Iraq! Saddam tried to sell oil for Euros. Gaddafi wanted to back a pan-African currency with gold to sell oil. US just spreading democracy 2 those poor,oppressed people?
6266 2018-01-14 17:23:28 In contrast, Canada’s oil and gas sector is looking forward to another year of uncertainty, low prices and increasing tax burdens.   We are in for a world of pain from the new age liberal clones and eco colonialists that wish for everyone to be poor and riding bikes #bcpoli

6272 2018-01-14 17:22:53 Very interesting but not a perfect method because fish oil supplements have data showing them to be less efficient than when consumed directly from fish and they used cod liver oil to balance n-3 between the arms.
6273 2018-01-14 17:22:42 Yes. Lacinato kale, also called dinosaur kale or black kale (a transliteration of what they call it "here in Europe"). It's kale, just a variant. Great sauteed with oil or thinly sliced and eaten raw in a lemony vinaigrette. Enjoy!
6274 2018-01-14 17:22:42 Russia likes cheap oil and America on the rise?  You are a dotard   Obama was the Marxist and his mentor a Communist. Do some research.
6275 2018-01-14 17:22:35 Lmao LFC are abusing Oil City
6276 2018-01-14 17:22:35 Lol.. You clearly didn't support City when Richard Dunne was CB (pre oil daddy days)
6277 2018-01-14 17:22:33 I am glad New Jersey has people pump your gas for you. Since oil companies make billions of dollars the least they can do is provide jobs for people.
6278 2018-01-14 17:22:24 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.
6279 2018-01-14 17:22:21 Yeah I was going to ask if the picture was directly linked to oil exploration, otherwise as someone who doesn’t know much about the topic, it’s pretty misleading.
6280 2018-01-14 17:22:13 Have you been to the oil fields in California? Have you seen the oil drilling wells of the California coast from Santa Barbara’s to Orange County? California uses 4 percent of its coast line for oil drilling. Why should oil drilling be relegated to only Southern CA?

6285 2018-01-14 17:21:53 Larry I am a “known critic” who has been screaming of what shale gas effect would have on Muskrat Falls since 2010, nobody wants to hear all that again. The convo needs to be on how we get this off our backs & stave off a mass out migration. $70 dollar oil is half whats needed.
6286 2018-01-14 17:21:52 or would it be good to try to balance out my skin's moisture??? but then again wouldn't oil cleansers throw off the pH balance of my skin??
6287 2018-01-14 17:21:49 Was it high or low THC cannabis oil?

6294 2018-01-14 17:21:03 okay ladies so should i get a water based cleanser or an oil based cleanser? i was thinking oil because i have extremely dry skin but i heard that the downside is that your skin is always trying to produce oils so my skin will be too oily???

6303 2018-01-14 17:20:43 Mediterranean Pizza...chicken, feta, black and green olives, olive oil and tomatoes
6304 2018-01-14 17:20:40 Cavolo Nero - chop roughly, steam it and dress with lemon juice and olive oil
6305 2018-01-14 17:20:38 Why would they be concerned, pipe lines and oil companies are safe remember. I don't remember this concern during the DAPL protests.
6306 2018-01-14 17:20:37 Don't count on the oil or tire issues being addressed or on it not being abandoned somewhere on the Beltway.
6307 2018-01-14 17:20:18 In the past week, my car needed an oil change, then someone backed up into it, and then I got a flat tire, and then on my way home to get the spare changed, the spare tire was blown. So it's just that kind of week.
6308 2018-01-14 17:20:16 Been doing research on diesel engine convertions and found the first diesel engine ran on environmentally friendly peanut oil! Screw you big oil! #nomadliving #Diesel
6309 2018-01-14 17:20:15 @guarnaschelli when u poach a protein in oil, does the end product result oily? Is it unhealthy like fried foods?
6310 2018-01-14 17:20:13 Well, by your forecast, oil & gold stocks shld be ok, & tech largely benefits from weak dollar. You like emerging markets but see rates rising significantly. EU stocks don't seem appealing per your thesis

6313 2018-01-14 17:20:10 RT @chelliepingree: Cosponsoring the bipartisan New England Coastline Protection to permanently prohibit oil & gas drilling off Maine's coast. Men and women who make their living on the water have enough to worry about w/o a potential oil spill #mepolitics #VoteTheOcean
6314 2018-01-14 17:20:09 As all of you hop in your car and use gas and oil. Oh wait we rixe busses they dont need oil and gas . Dumb shits

6319 2018-01-14 17:19:55 NO off shore drilling in California, Mr. Moron.   No drilling off Maine!  MA, RI, NY, NJ, OR, NC.   Actually, only 2 states that may not have good argument are SC & GA as I see it.  Has the Moron ever cleaned OIL OFF A DYING BIRD?!!!! #SundayMorning
6320 2018-01-14 17:19:44 What kind of cannabis oil? Low THC or high THC?
6321 2018-01-14 17:19:42 Oil runs the world! Oil will ruin the world. Sounds like income equality is bad in ur nation. We have it here too & it's getting worse. Just hoping war doesn't break out if USD declines.
6322 2018-01-14 17:19:27 my statement wasn´t based on jealousy.  It was merely to counter the patronising talks from some Norwegians boasting about their countries superior social service.  Well I say, it is only affordable bc of the oil. Nix jealous, only fact.
6323 2018-01-14 17:19:25 Ahh it's probably drying your oil out of your skin then! I've gotta use expensive moisturiser otherwise I end up with fucked skin
6324 2018-01-14 17:19:24 I cant stand it raw, but if its cooked with a little bit of oil and some garlic spice, maybe some chili powder 
6325 2018-01-14 17:19:17 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
6326 2018-01-14 17:19:10 US oil output will never top Saudi. Crude + Condensate = Maybe
6327 2018-01-14 17:19:04 Or an old audi TT. Nice car man had the pleasure of driving one a few times. Drinks a lot of oil tho. But I guess you read up on it before buying right?
6328 2018-01-14 17:19:02 And the toe nails? Get some Eucalyptus oil for those
6329 2018-01-14 17:19:01 Ya a mate gave me some tissue oil thingy that seems to be helping. We live and we learn

6332 2018-01-14 17:18:39 Lev14:16  And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:  #BibleVerse
6333 2018-01-14 17:18:32 This is insane; Israel's/AIPAC's hold on America's mid-east policy must be stopped; reports are all of this is another Israeli land grab for oil.
6334 2018-01-14 17:18:30 I meant to get peppermint oil but I got eucalyptus instead and it’s not doing the job lol
6335 2018-01-14 17:18:26 One thing I’m definitely against is coconut oil.
6336 2018-01-14 17:18:14 SHOOTA JUST GOT AN OIL CHANGE THATS TUFF
6337 2018-01-14 17:18:14 I think they do understand.  I think they understand that entrepreneurs don’t vote socialist.

They think, as an NDP staffer told me, “small oil and gas companies will have to adjust”
6338 2018-01-14 17:18:13 I can’t! I use proactiv on my face and body oil on my body when I don’t feel like using lotion. I can’t ever use lotion on my face no way 
6339 2018-01-14 17:18:12 Putting olive oil on my steaks must be the same feeling mothers get when putting baby oil on their children
6340 2018-01-14 17:18:05 Good there is no place in modern society for snake oil salesman...
6341 2018-01-14 17:18:04 Unconventional oil was not yet the phenomenon it is when Hubbert first espoused “peak oil”, but that certainly doesn’t mean it was excluded from definition (which applied to supply). On demand, the increase in share % is a surprise to me. Who predicted this in last 3 years?
6342 2018-01-14 17:18:01 I read something about adding coconut oil too?!? I’ll have to grab some coconut milk I need some detox
6343 2018-01-14 17:17:48 Aloe Vera gel , Aloe Vera spray , Rose water , Witch hazel , African black soap , and Castor oil WILL CHANGE YA LIFE

6346 2018-01-14 17:17:46 Slice or chop and brush with garlic-infused olive oil, bit of salt & pepper
6347 2018-01-14 17:17:13 Just finished oil pulling and I still can’t get used to the feeling of oil swishing around in my mouth  Managed 6 minutes today... going to try for 8 tomorrow

you're welcome
6350 2018-01-14 17:17:03 What Trump nor any of the States that do allow offshore drilling understand is the spills don't stay on the shores of those states ie: Florida & BP oil spill. We still don't know the long term effect it has had on the sea life in the Gulf. Al, La & Tx all pose threats to Florida.
6351 2018-01-14 17:17:03 California has a huge tourism industry.  And what about the fishing industry?  Both would be harmed by an oil spill.  This isn't just about protecting wildlife.
6352 2018-01-14 17:16:58 If I’m done before you then I’ll swoop I’m getting my oil changed.
6353 2018-01-14 17:16:55 Nope, just the one. 

Cuticle oil, though, is available in every purse, on every side table and the nightstand, randomly appears in the suitcase I used last year, and probably in other places, too...
6354 2018-01-14 17:16:53 Coconut oil is good for the face, natural
6355 2018-01-14 17:16:27 Norway isn’t in the EU. It has no national debt (North Sea oil surplus), so no need to raise capital, and their grid is owned by Stanett, a wholly Norwegian state owned company. Why the hell would ANYONE post, let alone believe this bollocks...
6356 2018-01-14 17:16:27 You right I need to put 9 types of beard oil on there
6357 2018-01-14 17:16:23 condolences for the #Iranian sailors at #Sanchi ship. Iran has failed on "Diplomatic relationship" with the world in order to save the life of sailors on the burning oil ship. Why could not the international law save the #environment from sinking the oil tanker?
6358 2018-01-14 17:16:19 Ice pack and peppermint oil
6359 2018-01-14 17:16:17 I really need to get an oil change.
6360 2018-01-14 17:16:06 No major oil company will bid on leases off several state coast due to expectations of too many too costly law suits by states ! They explore for oil/gas not law suits !
6361 2018-01-14 17:16:04 Talk to your AG replacement and have them add $15 per gallon to gas oil, $100 to plastic products and and one cent per gram weight of Californians. Target Silicon Valley with the Metal tax, of $2500 a device. Green and poor. The way you like them
6362 2018-01-14 17:15:56 I just bought the vape oil to this strain. Very powerful
6363 2018-01-14 17:15:56 “among other things?”  Like Putin’s help getting you elected; like your disregard for human lives and wild life (oil spills, climate change, pipelines that tear up sacred lands..) All for $$$. You are STUPID MAN!  @MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid @PattyArquette

6367 2018-01-14 17:15:16 But an oil spill would hurt other industries in California like tourism and fishing.  Or are you talking about the new jobs brought in to clean up oil spills?
6368 2018-01-14 17:15:11 Are you riding a walrus holding a shotgun in the oil spill?
6369 2018-01-14 17:15:08 @WOOLWORTHS_SA you guys created a whole food store out of a fridge,surely your enginuity can extend to making an easy to pour container for your coconut oil in the 1L tub,it's messy to pour when it melts.

6380 2018-01-14 17:14:14 My Google Art look-a-like wasn't funny enough to screenshot. It was just some Korean guy's self portrait oil painting. It was just like... "yea, fine I see why a machine AI would say that"

6382 2018-01-14 17:14:12 It took your buddy 0bama almost three weeks to address the public over the Gulf oil spill.  They had to drag him off the golf course.  Get a grip!
6383 2018-01-14 17:14:09 You had nothing to say about betting on high oil when it suited you! When Ed Martin LIED at your luncheon about White Rose gas option, your members many who knew better never bothered to contradict his bullshit. Can we get the I Believe in the Power of NL list btw? Web site gone!
6384 2018-01-14 17:14:06 I fr wanna try oil painting
6385 2018-01-14 17:14:01 Don’t throw away the green tops of beets. Use them in salads or sauté with garlic and olive oil. #CHNeats
6386 2018-01-14 17:13:46 Thankyou!!!! That is the real deal... not this over-commercialised cookin oil..
6387 2018-01-14 17:13:46 I guess it's time to see what the countries that make up OPEC decide to do now. In the past America's dependence on oil made raising the price of a barrel of oil equivalent to printing money in the basement. There was simply nothing ordinary Americans could do about it.  Now...?
6388 2018-01-14 17:13:27 Can someone out here point me in the direction to some local coconut oil? #pleaseandthanks
6389 2018-01-14 17:13:26 keep it to the oil’s at all times 
6390 2018-01-14 17:13:21 Those people are never out feeding the poor. Ca. s in debt because of illegal immigrants and poor government management of funds raised by taxes. It has been. There are so many regulations in Ca. for any mining and oil explorations. Trump is trying to alleviate those problems.

6422 2018-01-14 17:09:59 Trump is such a narcissistic FOOL. As if it matters what relationships the POTUS has with other world leaders. It is a bright, blinking red herring. Xi pretends to be his friend and then supplies oil to NK. He is so easily played by others because he thinks it is all about him.

6424 2018-01-14 17:09:41 Need to beef up the fat intake.. adding some higher fat greek yogurt, more ground flax seed, string cheese sticks, olive oil.

6426 2018-01-14 17:09:40 Is there anything coconut oil is NOT good for?
6427 2018-01-14 17:09:37 Good thing Norway has stashed hundreds of billions of dollars worth of currency to a fund that keeps on growing. From the oil revenue. They're pretty safe in that regard tbh.

6440 2018-01-14 17:08:43 I've always used prescribed body oil so maybe that's why
6441 2018-01-14 17:08:26 My dumbass really got my finger stick in a broom hole. I had to get my boss to put oil on it and my fat ass finger still wouldn’t budge, can y’all imagine the embarrassment?
6442 2018-01-14 17:08:22 HRC would not be in jail. They have never found anything criminal & brother they have looked.  Russia did not want her in office bc they knew she'd flatten them. W/trump 500 billion in oil deal w/exxon

6445 2018-01-14 17:07:43 This is a weird line of questioning. No I have combo skin. It's not like I dunk my face in a bucket of oil after my makeup. I put less than a drop on a beauty blender which absorbs most of it

6449 2018-01-14 17:06:49 @Maruti_Corp @maruti_swift Our Swift VXI engine got seized on a highway just 2 days after we serviced it. Reason for engine seizure was found out to be lack of engine oil and overheating because of that. Please look into this matter at the earliest and address it.

6451 2018-01-14 17:06:38 Norway wont be able to permanently subside everything, the oil will run out sooner or later, Peter.

6457 2018-01-14 17:05:42 Well... Perhaps that's the cause of this perturbation in this part of Latin America... It's all about oil and minerals resources
6458 2018-01-14 17:05:34 #TrinidadandTobago will have its first ever waste oil processing plant. Secretary of Infrastructure, Quarries and the Environment Councillor Kwesi Des Vignes said the plant located on the sister island will be a major diversifying money maker.

Ah, the hallmark of a Russian intellectual, so smug in his country's supposed superiority thanks to a decade of expensive oil.

6465 2018-01-14 17:04:44 I miss his civility but not his policy. A true progressive would not have accepted $400k speeches at the Carlyle Group after they got him to relax EPA rules in 2013 for their oil refineries. A true progressive would not have ended habeas corpus. He gave us more wars, not less.
6466 2018-01-14 17:04:41 So why the need for all of the rollbacks on offshore drilling when you’re looking for the last drip of oil in all of the Atlantic (except Florida coast of course) Go Green! Solar farms, wind power, you have some of the smartest scientists in the world work on cold fusion energy.
6467 2018-01-14 17:04:32 Trump idle while other nations fight Russian interference

-Flynn told Russia not to worry about sanctions

- Removing sanctions on Russian oil

6468 2018-01-14 17:04:29 Local car repair place has put "John 16:3" on their oil change reminder stickers. Oops?
6469 2018-01-14 17:04:23 Ah okay lol ! I do the same, but I use an oil around that area and a mixture of lotion and oil on my bum because it feels much more softer after. I'll deffo try waxing instead of my normal hair removal technique tho need to get over the fear
6470 2018-01-14 17:04:15 We use cleansers to strip the oil from our skin, so our skin makes MORE oil to compensate. When you stop doing that, and use oils instead, it takes a while for the skin to realize it doesn’t need to produce extra oil any more. It’s a fun time. 
6471 2018-01-14 17:04:04 I offer my condolences to the mourning families and survivors of the #Sanchi oil tanker's crew, who passed away during the heartbreaking incident of the burning and sinking tankers, which was truly tragic and horrendous; and I ask God to grant peace to their grieving hearts.
6472 2018-01-14 17:03:55 When I moved to the east coast, all I was concerned about was a warm, safe, happy place for the dongs & me.  Need a load of heating oil, but otherwise OK!!  (Will have that in a day or two, so no worries!)
6473 2018-01-14 17:03:51 Most animal feed ie soya is extracted soya a by-product. grains fed to animals does not reach milking quality,rape seed has oil extracted also by product that makes them dual purpose #lesswaste #handinhand

Which reminds me: what ever happened to the investigation into illegal donations from the oil industry? #crickets
6476 2018-01-14 17:03:39 All retailers use these tactics, sea oil hiring with no benefits happens in malls,and all retail chains. The problem is letting retail chains not pay for benefits of health insurance. They get away with this by only offering part time and seasonal work. Wake up it our reality.
6477 2018-01-14 17:03:30 Up getting this damn oil changed FINALLY
6478 2018-01-14 17:03:29 I would love a Sunday Riley oil cleanser, lip balm or hydrating serum. 
6479 2018-01-14 17:03:17 True but Argan oil can't hold anything but prayers on me
6480 2018-01-14 17:03:11 @VinnieTortorich just seen a commercial for “heart healthy “ mazola corn oil. Saying that it lowers cholesterol 2x more than olive oil. #fuckmazola. How say you

6487 2018-01-14 17:01:50 When you don't have to wait in line for an oil change 
6488 2018-01-14 17:01:41 In times like this, I wish I  had a husband... Last minute oil change before quick road trip!!!
6489 2018-01-14 17:01:37 Oh good just what we need more oil in the sea
6490 2018-01-14 17:01:27 I think @UN  is enjoying the killing probably because they are enjoying the oil in Nigeria too.
They just appointed #Kemi into pension committee. They know what is happening in Nigeria but they enjoy it.
6491 2018-01-14 17:01:18 Hopefully this includes no oil drilling/fracking in this area permitted
6492 2018-01-14 17:01:05 Can anyone recommend anything for bad post pregnancy stretch marks? bio oil is just not doing it.
6493 2018-01-14 17:01:05 Exactly! Perfect example of that is N. Korea n Venezuela, which has the largest oil deposit in the world. It was the richest country in S America until socialism/communist took over by Hugo Chavez. Then it became poorer by the passing of each yr until today.. they are bankrupt!
6494 2018-01-14 17:01:05 Can you imagine what an oil spill would do to Trumps bottom line at Mar-A-Lago? It would cripple the membership fees. #ImpeachTrump
6495 2018-01-14 17:01:04 How about Canada, Ontario mostly is paying your government in Michigan to take our power away from us. For your energy needs. What if we just cut that off? Canada also has one of the richest oil supplies on the face of the earth in the oil sands.
6496 2018-01-14 17:01:02 Oil Reaches $70/bbl for First Time in Three Years

6499 2018-01-14 17:00:30 For starters, the first new oil refinery built in 40 years broke ground in Texas this fall. This will bring many local jobs not to mention contribute to the upswing of the Permian Basin Oil Field where we make our living.

6502 2018-01-14 17:00:23 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
6503 2018-01-14 17:00:22 Shouldn’t need to google, you apparently traded oil on the spot market. Keen to know who market and how much volume. Shouldn’t need to google. I’m intimately familiar with the commods futures trading, thanks.
Left to your arguments good security would be dead.
6504 2018-01-14 17:00:22 Err, farming is subsidised, the oil industry is subsidised, the rail franchises are subsidised

6507 2018-01-14 17:00:07 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

6513 2018-01-14 16:59:42 There are many reports that all of the killing in Syria is over Israel's need for oil; is this another land-grab by zionists for oil?

6515 2018-01-14 16:59:15 was at Marshall’s with Ryan’s mom and i saw an oil defuser and said how i wanted to get one. And she secretly bought it and gave it to me when we got home

6517 2018-01-14 16:58:54 Does coconut oil help your hair grow?????
6518 2018-01-14 16:58:53 And by the way, the media hasn’t been hostile in the least. We aren’t calling him “fake president”, can you say the same about how he treats us?? Regardless, we will keep doing our jobs. We are the Fourth Estate.
6519 2018-01-14 16:58:50 Only in a centrally controlled socialist economy would food production depend on the price of oil. 

Socialism is a power grab under the pretense of helping people. If you can't admit that, you are either a manipulatable fool or one of the power grabbers.

6523 2018-01-14 16:58:07 Oil Slicks on the beach washing up up at Mar-a-Lago is not good for biz. Especially when it has become such a steady source of revenue.
6524 2018-01-14 16:58:05 On one hand a lotta MLMs are really cultish and make people believe this stuff actually works but on the other, fuck em anyways for reaching out to dying people and saying "have you tried thieves oil"

6528 2018-01-14 16:57:49 Yeah, keeping a mouthful of oil for 20 minutes is tricky at best... I think I see what those girls do as a skill now. 
6529 2018-01-14 16:57:42 Incorrect. I am closed to wasting my time on gibberish and snake oil.

6532 2018-01-14 16:57:12 That's nothing, I used to use 3-in-1 oil on my push bike. 
6533 2018-01-14 16:57:01 Once that's over they will move into the jungle for wild animals. What's good if your oil cannot feed your people?
6534 2018-01-14 16:56:57 I think it's coming. I will also agree that the stock market did increase during obama. We had nowhere else to go but up! But the oil markets went down, solar companies failed, I believe Tech markets went up. However, I won't give obama credit for how well our country is doing.

6543 2018-01-14 16:55:23 Everything said and done in the Oval and at 1600 is important. One creates an international incident when insulting other countries and calling other world leaders name. This man can’t even visit our closest ally (UK) because he can’t keep it together.
6544 2018-01-14 16:55:23 In other news, there is some stinky hair in this choir stand and my spirit is grieved.

6550 2018-01-14 16:54:19 Since media outlets won’t cover it, here’s the bad news on the Iranian oil vessel in the China sea. There was an explosion and now the ship is sinking. No survivors :( God be w/ the families of the crew.

6555 2018-01-14 16:53:36 I can't account for taste, but a lot of people have idealized heroes. The story is about how powerful people manipulate the power dynamic to get what they want (sometimes perhaps not even realizing it). It's more a cautionary tale than an accusation, imho.

6576 2018-01-14 16:51:09 Nope. We have a very strict budget so not to overspend and create inflation. Had the most stable economy trough the financial crisis 2008-present. Oil money is mostly put away in a fond (among worlds biggest) for future generations and health care/pensions.

6581 2018-01-14 16:49:49 We do inspect certain aspects of the vehicle during a routine oil change for the safety of the customer. We apologize for the long wait times as we are experiencing an increase in traffic to our service department. Thank you!

6585 2018-01-14 16:49:12 Well for 40+ years Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenue.over 300BN and yet still managed to almost bankrupt an oil rich UK,why should scots give up 92% of their wealth to prop up Westminster when they ignore our vote?
6586 2018-01-14 16:49:04 Waiting for my oil to be changed and in comes a papa johns delivery for the workers.

6589 2018-01-14 16:48:47 but sadly all 31 crew memebers of the Oil tanker Sanchi are presumed dead after 8 days burning
6590 2018-01-14 16:48:42 They have real progressive governmnets and policies.  It is about policy and not identity.  They spend taxes on the people and not give it all away to Wall Street, Big OIl, and Military Industrla Complex, etc....  Trump sold out to establishmnet.  He is a fake populist!!!
6591 2018-01-14 16:48:39 I make my own face oils. I’ve been using oil to clean my skin for about 7 years, and started mixing my own serum about 3-4 years ago. Easy and cheap. Unlike me.
6592 2018-01-14 16:48:35 I had this gel oil a few yrs ago that worked great. Forgot exactly the name but it was something ‘Gold’ 
6593 2018-01-14 16:48:16 I have special oil to get wax off girl

6596 2018-01-14 16:47:08 No one called him a rapist. No one. It's hard to explain, but if you've been in that situation, you know why it matters. Have you ever met a personal idol of yours? Think if that person used your worship against you, acting aggressive and then re-adopting the hero persona.
6597 2018-01-14 16:46:46 I'm just sick cuz I'm out of stick , oil , and wood chip incense . My bad akh. It took it out on you
6598 2018-01-14 16:46:42 Sugar plus olive/coconut oil works beautifully too. You won’t even need a balm afterwords. 
Also, ghee. Magic on the lips.
6599 2018-01-14 16:46:33 Todays experimental bunny noms; spice cake slice, walnut oil butter and a slice of havarti cheese on top. Yummy level 8/10.

6601 2018-01-14 16:46:23 It’s swishing oil in your mouth to remove bacteria and toxins, basically. I use organic coconut oil & do it for about 20 minutes. There’s debate on if it actually does anything or not, but I enjoy how it feels after.
6602 2018-01-14 16:46:16 It's confirmed... Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world...
6603 2018-01-14 16:46:01 Wale mashabiki wa oil money
6604 2018-01-14 16:45:17 @FoxNewsSunday  we always seem to think that WE need to be in the faces of countries that disagree with capitalism or the US on ancient premises.  Isn't it time the US fix itself before we worry once again about Iran or other countries? Or is this just about oil?
6605 2018-01-14 16:45:16 Why do I keep on touching my eyebrows. Huta yung Castor oil..

6608 2018-01-14 16:44:34 Why?  An oil spill might ad some new smell to your state. Better than piss and 
6609 2018-01-14 16:44:28 I gotta get a oil change today 
6610 2018-01-14 16:44:24 Trump wants to allow unnecessary offshore oil drilling except in Florida. Why is it just that he doesn’t want oil spills in front of his property?
6611 2018-01-14 16:44:12 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
6612 2018-01-14 16:44:00 And yes yes to olive oil. Mel was told to put that in his ear before going swimming by an ENT consultant after he had an abscess (probably caused by infection caught from the pool).

6614 2018-01-14 16:43:33 A oil rich history. You support City when you were shite?
6615 2018-01-14 16:43:22 It exists in the news because we are uncomfortable talking about a war torn stateless region so close to our main source of oil.
6616 2018-01-14 16:43:19 The fact people are saying nurse is a #1 D man tells you everything you need to know about why the oil are terrible.

6620 2018-01-14 16:42:54 Bless your misguided heart. April was doing her job. The job of the Fourth Estate is to keep our government accountable...including and especially Trump...almost 2,000 lies in his first year. Respect is earned.
6621 2018-01-14 16:42:48 Let me have some of that Extra Virgin Oil
6622 2018-01-14 16:42:42 It is sad. There has to be a better substitute for an oil that causes so much damage to our environment one must think.
6623 2018-01-14 16:42:28 I'm on Twitter to learn, what's oil pull?
6624 2018-01-14 16:42:26 Pretty sure you're blindly following a Snake Oil Salesman
6625 2018-01-14 16:42:21 And use oil in your foundation. Your foundation will last longer and it goes on smoothly on your skin. 
6626 2018-01-14 16:42:20 Pleny of insecure people looking for an out but have neither the time nor capacity to either research a subject or properly validate a source.

They wanted a cure-all: they chose snake oil.
6627 2018-01-14 16:42:04 The worse thing you can be in the age of social media isn't a criminal (no one, even the most radical types are saying Aziz should go to jail for this) but a hypocrite or a phony. 

Aziz backlash is based on his phoniness.

#MeToo is mostly about phony men, not criminals.
6628 2018-01-14 16:42:04 Mad this is what I use minus the nuxe oil and I like the vanilla chai scented cream so stick up at Xmas.
6629 2018-01-14 16:42:01 Geo / Jung must oil their holes now coz SC is going to love them

6631 2018-01-14 16:41:55 Yup...and it bleeds into everything else, particularly the excuse culture ("Corrupt refs!" "Oil clubs!" "Bad schedule!") that's been constructed to always give Wenger a way out
6632 2018-01-14 16:40:59 The modern world in which countries fight for oil is terrible. They also fought for tea and opium. What's next? Water?
6633 2018-01-14 16:40:35 James Do You Have An Advanced Degree! Why Then Should Nigerians Be Requested To Have Advanced Degrees!Where Is Chevron & Exxon Getting A Majority of their Crude Oil- You Guessed It NIGERIA!Great Country With Great Educated people!Trump Should Travel & Educate Himself! Sad!!

6640 2018-01-14 16:39:04 What about one or two small oil stain spots on the shirt. And a few places near the joints with cracks. And a few spots where the cracks became rust. Another thought maybe have some old war wounds where someone's sword or bullet punctured and that is where she is rusting
6641 2018-01-14 16:39:02 Study after study shows that increasing consumption of DHA and EPA, whether via diet or short-term intervention with fish oil supplements, reduces disease severity and symptoms. #PaleoPrinciples #nutrientdensity

6647 2018-01-14 16:37:59 Funnily enough I’m having the same! Chicken rubbed with oil and some rubba rubba, a ton of roasters cooked in beef dripping, gravy and veg. Fantastic. 
6648 2018-01-14 16:37:55 Suuuuuuuuuuuuper painful. My fingers are soaked with coconut oil - but the pretty will be worth it.
6649 2018-01-14 16:37:42 When life hands you snake oil, make salad dressing...
6650 2018-01-14 16:37:40 I don't like cooking w/ olive oil
6651 2018-01-14 16:37:35 With new energy sources, oil and gas will no longer guide the destinies of nations.
6652 2018-01-14 16:37:18 So I'm reading the Harley forums about oil.  Always like to see what folks think of @ShellRotella, my oil of choice.  What's with all these dudes that are proud of the fact they only have to change their oil once a year?

Dude, do you even ride?  
Matching trailer too?

6659 2018-01-14 16:36:19 I need to get the oil changed in my car and get it smogged, but I don't want to move.

6665 2018-01-14 16:35:03 Just threw a rosemary, thyme, garlic, salt and olive oil rubbed lamb shoulder onto the BBQ. Cooking it slow at 200f for Sunday dinner. Yum.

6671 2018-01-14 16:34:16 Venezuela ripped of the people,  they had plenty of money from oil which their government stole, that's what went wrong in Venezuela. This is what is happening in the US now. Take for rich rob the poor
6672 2018-01-14 16:34:09 Also a absolute sleeper is $aoc a oil stock
 I will pick up 1m shares. Tuck them away and there is a very good chance it will be 1$ years end . Great company do your dd on them. Awesome long term play
6673 2018-01-14 16:34:00 There has never been any such “YPG” plan. This is a #US-created ❝SDF❞ plan, whereby they retrain #ISIS fighters to resist any attempt by the #SAA to reclaim the land and oil fields east of the RIver.

6688 2018-01-13 23:58:32 Demand elasticity has declined as oil pushed out of easier-to-substitute sectors and short term elasticity lower than long term. I think ques is whether long term elasticity may increase in future as substitutes to oil in transport emerge.

6717 2018-01-13 23:56:10 But has to be butter, not sunflower oil. Olive oil might be OK, but not tried it. Soda farls also good for carbs - excellent medium for fried eggs.
6718 2018-01-13 23:55:46 He has some made w olive oils and others w coconut oil. I can’t wait for bath time!! 
6719 2018-01-13 23:55:39 For the U.S. to have an equivalent situation, we'd have to pump over 120 million barrels per day of oil given our population. The whole world only uses about 90 million barrels per day.

6721 2018-01-13 23:55:19 I’m so butch lol today I changed my own windshield wipers   next... I’ll be changing my own oil too hahaha lol 
6722 2018-01-13 23:55:17 Johnston-use land for affordable housing, not oil and gas or strip mall
6723 2018-01-13 23:55:11 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
6724 2018-01-13 23:55:11 Sounds good. But inches of concrete are not protection. Nuclear containment is frm 4.5 ft to 12ft thick  in addition to linings.
6725 2018-01-13 23:54:49 I was definitely off the oil 
6726 2018-01-13 23:54:46 sure and oil was "running out" right after the ref, WM trying to prove a point and show us we could not live without them, meanwhile billions o barrels o oil "found" quite suddenly, if YOU want to listen to their shite, be used as a pawn in their political chess board, b my guest
6727 2018-01-13 23:54:43 putting vitamin e oil on my lips has changed my life
6728 2018-01-13 23:54:29 it is so stiff so i use cooking oil
6729 2018-01-13 23:54:27 No one in Haiti respects Clinton they robbed the poorest of the poor and Hillary's brother has the mineral rights for nine years because they know there's oil and gold..SILSBY who tried to human traffic children changed her name..
6730 2018-01-13 23:54:25 Oil change, sap removal, laundry, shopping for birthday presents, and now I’m finally sitting down to football. 
6731 2018-01-13 23:54:15 go rub oil on your chest and make mediocre grilled cheese on your gas stove big bear
6732 2018-01-13 23:54:05 Yes. Sell oil for manufacturing not wasting it out our tail pipes at the drive thru for a $2 coffee. That’s why Norway now has 50% EVs!Smart
6733 2018-01-13 23:54:03 I ALWAY BEING CHASE BY OIL CAN HARREY.

6736 2018-01-13 23:53:31 Never balanced budgets?  You expect a lot from a party who has been in power for what 2 years and that was when Oil plummeted in price.
6737 2018-01-13 23:53:06 Uh equalization payments? You realize before this year after oil collapsed, the rest of the country was paying for your oil loving ass? Back away? Dude what little you know about fact would fit in a thimble. I feel sad for how uniformed you are.
6738 2018-01-13 23:53:02 If, as you state, the safety & security of US is a top priority why aren't you doing anything to combat climate change? >97% of climate scientists (99.9% NOT funded by big oil) agree that this is a HUGE threat. If big business could profit from climate change @GOP might care!

6740 2018-01-13 23:52:50 @DomCraik can i have your dads address and send him a tiny oil painting to make up for how bad the drawing in 2014 was
6741 2018-01-13 23:52:42 I didn’t buy the golf. The guy had put about 8 quarts into a 4 quart engine. He was wondering why it was smoking and burning oil. Two words: FILL LINE
6742 2018-01-13 23:52:38 Agreed! But his bigger problem. He's on the biggest world stage now and everyone scales are dropping from their eyes. He was NEVER a deal maker. He's ill-educated, therefore unintelligent, snake oil conman.
6743 2018-01-13 23:52:26 i see you have a little decency to put English in inverted commas..............low prices are dictated by the very ppl who give "incentives" works out cheaper when they glut the market to cut off need for middle east oil ALL games all pawns in a political game
6744 2018-01-13 23:51:52 Oil/balm cleanser itu contohnya apa..?? Baru tau loh.
6745 2018-01-13 23:51:49 Ive used Syrian olive oil soap loads when I was out there and I know it will be great.

6748 2018-01-13 23:51:23 we have the ability to switch.If we could just stop wasting it out the tail pipe.use Oil for manufacturing consumer goods only.

#GoldenKnights are 11-8-1 away, 9-1 in last 10; Oil is 10-11-2 and 3-6-1. 
The #NHL is one big cosmic joke.

6759 2018-01-13 23:48:45 No, my argument isn't. It's purely to point out that you can't compare Norway to any other contry on Earth. Their oil wealth vs small population makes possible their welfare state. Even far beyond what other Scandinavia countries can do.
6760 2018-01-13 23:48:26 I just spent like an hour massaging my feet w coconut oil
6761 2018-01-13 23:48:23 You are looking to squeeze your residents to poverty by paying high gas and oil prices. You are thwarting the country’s ability to be fully independent of foreign oil.

6778 2018-01-13 23:46:00 Thank God for gas, oil and coal
6779 2018-01-13 23:46:00 As I recall. The article was about Big Oil. Hello. Big Oil covers not just gas, but pharmaceuticals, plastic, et al. I am on subject. I am wondering why you see Big Oil and only see Gas?
6780 2018-01-13 23:45:35 Why the crap should oil companies have to pay for putting themselves out of business? Without fossil fuels we would have 18th century tech
6781 2018-01-13 23:45:23 The steam engine started it, then oil skyrocketed it. But the oil's not going to last much longer so there will be a sharp drop coming.

6804 2018-01-13 23:42:06 No, that's snake oil.

6826 2018-01-13 23:38:53 castor oil SAVED me
6827 2018-01-13 23:38:39 And then there was the time Obama refused to use US assets to clean up after the BP oil spill because it was their fault, all the while not stopping the environmental destruction. But I guess Obama doesn't vacation at the gulf, so who cares?
6828 2018-01-13 23:38:36 Nope no response yet! I feel sorry for any other people that had that oil and didn’t check the date because there has bound to be more than one of the oils out of date

6841 2018-01-13 23:37:44 You clearly have a lot of spare time. Why not campaign against some real issues? Turn those chemtards onto some real pollution issues instead? Fracking? Oil shale? The tide of plastic filling our oceans? Why waste your time on a fantasy, fighting something that isn't happening?
6842 2018-01-13 23:37:44 sometimes during class ill just be wiping the oil off of my nose and under eyes and ill catch someone looking at me all concerned and i feel bad bc they think im crying but in reality im just a greasy bitch

6844 2018-01-13 23:37:37 Haiti got independence.  Mexico and Venezuela found vast amounts of oil.  The fault is in how they organize and educate themselves.  Vincente Fox should spend some time trying to figure out why his people keep crawling into the USA rather than slamming Trump.

6848 2018-01-13 23:36:09 there  might be a big oil drilling tonight in vegas @matthewsteeper @Darudevil @kimbramusic
6849 2018-01-13 23:36:07 That would be crisps, in local parlance. 'Chips' on the other hand are rectangular chunks of potatoe, deep fried in oil, until golden brown, usually served with salt, vinegar and ketchup. Some even like gravy or a savoury dip. The seagull however is not fussy, they'd eat anything

6856 2018-01-13 23:35:18 So this morning I got to work and it was 60 degrees and I was working in a T-shirt

By noon, the temperature had dropped 30 degrees, the ground was frozen, and I was wearing 3 heavy jackets 

But yea, let’s keep drilling for oil ‘til our planet is a raisin
6857 2018-01-13 23:35:00 Historical examples: CIA coups against Guatemala for United Fruit, against Iran for Big Oil, to the detriment of the peoples of the countries. Democratically elected presidents overthrown for the sake of corporate profits.

6859 2018-01-13 23:34:27 You just need to experiment a bit more. Your body might reject vegetables in an uncombined state but try something like meatballs with a little bit of chopped mushrooms inside and gravy with minced onions served over a bed of cheese tortellini and a side of bread and olive oil
6860 2018-01-13 23:34:26 Some sounded , most not according to reports now. Is this not an integrated system? Why not?

6873 2018-01-13 23:31:34 Emergency visit to the dentist Monday morning for you young man. Sounds like an abscess. Root canal possible or just get it yanked. So clove oil on a cotton ball held against it with your cheek will numb n ease the pain till you can get it looked at
6874 2018-01-13 23:31:25 Radical Islam succeed because of Sunni/Whabbi money from Saudi Arabian oil money. It has corrupted the people in power in our society. It will be the ruin of us.
6875 2018-01-13 23:31:22 what I hate the most is some places just re cook the meat in oil and serve it like that. Que chiste lol?
6876 2018-01-13 23:31:20 Well, guess I'd better oil up.

6879 2018-01-13 23:30:59 that's nice but what about the uncertified palm oil in your own brand products?
6880 2018-01-13 23:30:53 It looks like #potus solution to the deficit is to sell off our land to oil drillers and frackers.  Basically turn us into an exploited third world country.

6887 2018-01-13 23:29:01 Just dropped $250 on canvases and oil paint. The whole "starving artist" trope makes sense now. 
6888 2018-01-13 23:28:39 Tea tree oil can be deadly to cats. I use essential oils a lot. I never diffuse nor use them ever on my cats. Also when using them make sure you use a good brand like Doterra ( I don’t sell them) the cheap stuff at bedbath or Walmart is no good

6898 2018-01-13 23:27:12 my car has been due for an oil change about 3,000 miles ago... is this what it feels like to be a rebellious “adult”?
6899 2018-01-13 23:27:04 I have awful toothache lately that only seems to happen when I go to bed so if someone could pop over with some clove oil or maybe just a Valium to knock me out that would be fab.
6900 2018-01-13 23:27:02 @MBTA on the orange line. Fix the track or oil the wheels the screeching high pitched ear deaf sounds are too much. Going to work every day im sure people are complaining and writing about this!

6903 2018-01-13 23:26:41 You take tax payer money to give to corporations. They give tiny bits back and keep the rest. That's fair, NOT..Make the corps, oil companies and big pharma stop taking handouts and pay their fair of taxes and there would be enough money for all the services needed and your wall.
6904 2018-01-13 23:26:30 Gold, Diamonds, Oil, Gas, Rubber ,Copper, Coal, etc.- Yeah, a real "s.h." that Europeans scrambled to imperialize!

6912 2018-01-13 23:25:58 will only work with a carbon tax on fossil fuels that essentially renders in-the-ground oil/coal as worthless more or less immediately, and gas within the decade, plus massive gov subsidy to get Molten Salt Thorium reactors going.

6914 2018-01-13 23:25:50 Tea tree oil was a big failure when daughter had nits at primary school. I was a bit clueless & thought she had dandruff until one flew out of hair in Argos.
6915 2018-01-13 23:25:42 I like the Kiehl’s Beard Oil honestly
6916 2018-01-13 23:25:26 Yeah, special favors handed out by politicians, like Florida's offshore oil drilling exemption. Drain the swamp indeed.
6917 2018-01-13 23:24:58 I just worry about our lack of scoring. Oil has the players, but for whatever reason consistent scoring isn't there.

6952 2018-01-13 23:20:20 Well I mean, Bush was. But whatever. Let’s just invade some countries for oil and opium and then act like we’re not terrorist and be surprised when something like Isis pops up. The American machine is cruel, and has you fooled. The blood is on your hands

7008 2018-01-13 23:11:27 No other president has screwed up so much in one year! Coal mines can pollute Again! Safety regulations for oil platforms rescinded, climate accord withdrawal! Yippeee! Sold us out to big business!

7013 2018-01-13 23:10:52 I was having such a great day... being gay and dropping off my gf... I came home to the stove on and oil burning on a pan.

7015 2018-01-13 23:10:36 This is why it is a farce that he is against "Deep State", when the oil, gas and weapons industries ARE Deep State.

7017 2018-01-13 23:10:24 So many favorites, if I have to pick one it is lavender.  I absolutely love the smell ... for me it is so grounding and relaxing.  It is definitely my “soul” oil. 
It also connects me back to my experience of hand planting it with friends at the YL Farm.  RT@jaredsturner

7019 2018-01-13 23:10:01 Before frying, sprinkle a little salt in your pan which will help keep the oil from splattering.
7020 2018-01-13 23:09:53 In other food news, I tossed batons of carrot with oil and garlic, and roasted them. @normwilner points out that I have invented carrot fries and they are great.

7023 2018-01-13 23:09:20 I have a feeling, the way madrid are going down, they will soon discover oil.
7024 2018-01-13 23:09:20 Amazing how many have not provinces want nothing to do with oil or gas.
7025 2018-01-13 23:09:09 I got low oil pressure then my truck locked up 
7026 2018-01-13 23:09:09 Seven kaiju movies and Gargoyles premiered on #Svengoolie in 2017. This list is banana oil.
7027 2018-01-13 23:08:59 Soooo, he's speaking the truth? Oil is causing climate change, that is a indespuatable fact, to say otherwise is like saying the planet is flat or that God created humanity from scratch, yet again am not surprised

7034 2018-01-13 23:08:00 In terms of oil-state dictatorships, the US can hinder dictators by pursuing tight oil (shale) technology. In this case, technology does a better job than politics.

7054 2018-01-13 23:05:09 It’s a special kind of “online processing” that involves chemical peels and deep oil treatments.

7058 2018-01-13 23:04:55 In the AM I use a konjac sponge 2 lightly exfoliate followed by a cleansing toner. At night I use a Clarisonic w/ a charcoal cleanser, then toner, then moisturizer (w a drop of facial vitamin e and argon oil) I’ve found washing my face 1x/day reduced oilyness + blemishes
7059 2018-01-13 23:04:50 Personally i don’t use anything on my face at this point because i have the same issue?? I use essential oil moisturizer but i only use plain African black soap or no soap in the shower
7060 2018-01-13 23:04:47 I was topping off the oil on my car and a old white lady came out bitching at me how I can't work on my car in front of her house and to go do it elsewhere. Biiitch whaat you crazy!

7062 2018-01-13 23:04:35 I cut them in quarters (I had the small tortillas) and put them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Recipe said brush with veg oil. I sprayed with butter flavor Crisco & sprinkled sea salt. 400F oven and 8 minutes was plenty.
7063 2018-01-13 23:04:23 @SammieGirlRSD I saw your profile about pain from RSD.  You need to try a strong CBD oil!!!  I sell the purest on market if interested but find one somewhere!
7064 2018-01-13 23:04:16 Jesus, kid. We have a good grip on where oil comes from and a lot of the cellular mechanism of insulin. It’s a shame so many people get on the internet and say a bunch of crap, because it diminishes our progress as a species.

7069 2018-01-13 23:03:40 Those look ! We just did muffins today. Banana bran with butterscotch chips for my son, banana bran with raisins for me! Both reduced sugar and subbed 2/3 oil for plain Greek yogurt! #protein #fibre #CookingTogether
7070 2018-01-13 23:03:28 Reminds me of another young immigrant that crossed the Atlantic from Sicily in the early 1900s. He was a true American success story, becoming one of NY area’s most powerful businessmen and renowned olive oil importer.
7071 2018-01-13 23:03:21 Goes to get oil changed and leaves @guster #lostandgoneforever cd playing starting on track 1. Gets car back on cd is on track 5.
7072 2018-01-13 23:03:19 I went to my friend’s house and saw these oil bottles so I was like, “we should put some essential oils in the diffuser”. Turns out they were vape juice bottles 
7073 2018-01-13 23:03:19 お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！

英文：Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!
7074 2018-01-13 23:02:51 Or maybe an oil that's less likely to be quickly absorbed by skin. It would SUCK to not be able to wash it off.
7075 2018-01-13 23:02:50 Laugh all you want. You know that Iranians are present for every nuke test? You know they work hand in hand on ICBM development?
7076 2018-01-13 23:02:45 Plus, when I was riding, I don't think I went a summer without treating crud on at least one horse. I think my iodine-mineral oil spray bottle is still leaking somewhere in deep storage.

7081 2018-01-13 23:02:03 I haven’t done a tea tree oil treatment in so long. I forgot how this works.
7082 2018-01-13 23:02:00 Thank God for Wild Orange essential oil. It literally immediately started to calm my nerves so I can start getting ready. 
7083 2018-01-13 23:01:46 Flax seed oil I think but don't quote me on that

7087 2018-01-13 23:01:30 Yes , I see what you mean - you get 16% of your original oil energy content ! Your phrase " change of state" perplexed me, since in all cases it's a 'change of state' . . .
7088 2018-01-13 23:01:14 As we take important steps to move towards energy independence liberal Democrats start suing oil companies under the guise of global warming.
7089 2018-01-13 23:01:13 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
7090 2018-01-13 23:01:06 Once again everybody is fake but you. You are nothing more than a snake oil salesman not very good one at that.
7091 2018-01-13 23:00:51 あら。

Someone was finally brave enough to change my oil on his own.
7092 2018-01-13 23:00:18 Stay strong,dnt die now,we love u
7093 2018-01-13 23:00:14 i went to the art store today! i replenished my oil paints and bought some surfaces to paint on with that and watercolor. i also got yarn and im making a min min hat as we speak :O!!
7094 2018-01-13 23:00:09 A variety of scenarios could determine how the #OPEC deal might come to an end: civil unrest in Venezuela and Iran that may lead to supply disruptions,  #Russia pulling out of the pact in June; OPEC members and other parties starting or continuing to cheat; and oil prices rising.
7095 2018-01-13 22:59:54 They have developed roof shingles, windows and even road surfaces that will capture the sun's energy.  The technology is being stifled by oil interests, obviously, and has been for over 40 years.
7096 2018-01-13 22:59:50 Understood and I got your point. But unfortunately venezuela lost much of a relevance it once and I stress ONCE had in global oil markets.
7097 2018-01-13 22:59:47 Shouldn't @KeithOlbermann direct his anger at @Hawaii_EMA since they appear to be the cause of this? 
Oh, right, that's what a sane person would do.
Never mind!
7098 2018-01-13 22:59:41 Unemployment rate is dropping & oil price is rising so it is no-brainer inflation will go up in Canada & BOC will raise rates. Consider rate hike and also OSFI stress tests & China monetary policy, Toronto houses above 1MM (e.g.: most detached homes) may go down further in 2018!
7099 2018-01-13 22:59:34 Dilute with a LOT of jojoba oil, I would guess.
7100 2018-01-13 22:59:21 I agree with you. We have to protect our ocean, parks& water. There are other jobs in alternative energy& tech. Adults can go back to college& change careers to adapt to todays work climate. Trump wants to drag US back to the 70s. w Nuclear power Coal& more oil vs moving ahead
7101 2018-01-13 22:59:19 GUYS my hair is literally perfect w minimal effort today just leave in and oil no cream no mousse no pudding yet I have no one to see and no pics to take

7103 2018-01-13 22:58:46 Let's if the Iran oil premium takes a breather.
7104 2018-01-13 22:58:31 ใช้แค่ 100% extra virgin olive oil (สำหรับกินนี่แหละ) ทาหนังหัวทิ้งไว้สักพักก่อนสระออกก็เวิร์คที่สุดแล้วเอาจริง ๆ  ไม่ก็ 100% extra virgin coconut oil ก็ได้ ไม่ต้องมีสูตรเยอะหรอก
7105 2018-01-13 22:58:26 Def never liked the man prior to running for office. Just a silver spooned snake oil salesman trying to  grab p***sy and being disgusting always.
7106 2018-01-13 22:58:22 After last storm we were low on oil &it was in negatives. We had to keep heat at 57 and wear 5 layers.  So I see the temptation for warmth..
7107 2018-01-13 22:58:00 Did you put anything in the pan with the beans? Little bit of oil?
7108 2018-01-13 22:57:57 If only all our selfies could be done in complexion-smoothing oil paints by our fathers :)
7109 2018-01-13 22:57:52 psa olive oil is great at cleaning bits without scratching or rusting them!
7110 2018-01-13 22:57:37 I use tea tree oil directly on a blemish to help kill bacteria/get rid of it, followed by the Kiehl’s deep pore cleansing clay mask (a holy grail product-totally worth the $ and lasts forever)
7111 2018-01-13 22:57:23 No. All I have seen is screen shots of warning and Chiron on TV. Not one mention of sirens on coverage.
7112 2018-01-13 22:57:11 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
7113 2018-01-13 22:56:58 We're crazed that our fellow citizens believed your snake oil diatribe.

7115 2018-01-13 22:56:44 Yes, yees there is. Oil of Bacon. Your welcome.
7116 2018-01-13 22:56:33 I agree with your synopsis in summary but in fairness the point regarding Balague is an accurate one. City are playing sumptuous football & it’s driven on the back of oil laden wealth which no doubt your not bothered with as I wouldn’t in your shoes.

7118 2018-01-13 22:56:24 made a yeast free bread and it just tastes and looks like a sugar cookie but instead of sugar olive oil
7119 2018-01-13 22:56:21 I told you to start putting oil in your hair

7129 2018-01-13 22:54:40 they are the softest dogs i’ve ever touched. i know that sounds biased, but even the vet was impressed by their shine & softness. i chalk it up to their fish oil supplement & embarrassingly fancy diet

7131 2018-01-13 22:54:13 I really hope this castor oil helping my hair.
7132 2018-01-13 22:53:55 Been using black caster, flaxseed & coconut oil in my hair since the beginning of November & that shit really grew 
7133 2018-01-13 22:53:40 my skin is too dry for foundation to look good.... moisturizer, hydrating face mask, facial oil primer & none of it does anything to help 
7134 2018-01-13 22:53:35 Y lo mío es también solo una opinión Sr Salazar, y ojo, no es béisbol, se lo digo para q quede bien, y me da igual si es popular o no, saludos
7135 2018-01-13 22:53:35 For me as I have been saying Venezuela in the short and even medium term won't have relevance if ever there will be a major political turmoil related to its impact in oil markets due to its diminishing overall production ...

7140 2018-01-13 22:52:31 Ben nye and kryolan are my favs. I recommend never using oil based makeup for your body unless you absolutely hate yourself and touching anything. (lol homestuck flashbacks)
7141 2018-01-13 22:52:30 Excellent...many plant based alternatives are available...we must Ban all oil based plastics....now.
7142 2018-01-13 22:52:20 Waiting at a dive bar, watching the Falcons game and waiting for my truck to get an oil change.... how did I ever like these places? The people here suck!
7143 2018-01-13 22:52:17 I also make potato-waffles without added oil, thanks to a tip from the very helpful @Spudfit!
7144 2018-01-13 22:52:07 I was trying to buy Maui moisture curl quench + coconut oil shampoo and the Location is on W. main in Kalamazoo, MI

7146 2018-01-13 22:51:52 And we are not borrowing to pay salary as was being done in 2014 under the hero when oil was being sold at $80
7147 2018-01-13 22:51:45 I’m gonna start cat fishing oil field workers and maybe they’ll send me money 
7148 2018-01-13 22:51:45 my mom just Pressed me to find a coupon online so the oil change could be cheaper....
7149 2018-01-13 22:51:44 See: C60 - a form of fullerene normally suspended in an olive oil solution. Wicked stuff.
7150 2018-01-13 22:51:41 Mmm well there's a lot of them that have really good properties such as calmative and anxiety reducing ones, they can have good healthful benefits but like anything you should research it. Like for example mustard oil is bad for everyone.
7151 2018-01-13 22:50:58 No doubt some of the cash Obama sent to Iran, DPRK partner in crime, went to Kim to finance this. Iran following same path as DPRK. Obama
7152 2018-01-13 22:50:51 Yes, I did that test. It could be that one of the keys to my success with potatoes is not cooking them in vegetable oil. I usually steam or slow-cook them.
7153 2018-01-13 22:50:46 هههههههههههههه الكلام دا عيبه ف حقك
7154 2018-01-13 22:50:45 omg that’s how i was today. i was gonna get a coffee then i didn’t bc my window was froze and i went to get my oil changed and by the grace of God when i pulled into the auto place my window rolled down
7155 2018-01-13 22:50:45 My favorite essential oil is release. I use it every night before bed by put drops in my palms so when I have my hands up by my face at night I can smell it all night long. I love young living as a company, there products and the people you meet along the way!
7156 2018-01-13 22:50:44 FOR THIS DAY IS UPON YOU AND HE HAS COME QUICKLY AS A THIEF IN THE NIGHT AND YOU WERE FOUND WITH EVERY VESSEL FILLED WITH OIL.
7157 2018-01-13 22:50:35 Great graph. I will add oil price benchmark (ex, Brent) adjusted by inflation.
7158 2018-01-13 22:50:02 Send the team of Oil, into the land of DELETION!

7159 2018-01-13 22:49:39 Hey @MAVTV us cord cutters need a better option to watch the Chili Bowl than a $99 yearly subscription to Lucas Oil TV.
7160 2018-01-13 22:49:36 Sr @DiegoArcos14 es solo una opinión mía ... Usted como conocedor d varios deportes el beisbol no es ni será popular en Ec
7161 2018-01-13 22:49:30 Tea tree oil did my hair some justice, my bob cut has definitely grown out.
7162 2018-01-13 22:49:27 FG's spending obligations are largely naira-denominated so converting to $ is pointless. It's spending is largely on recurrent expenditure like public sector wages. These obligations didn't increase with the depreciation of the Naira or loss of oil dollars
7163 2018-01-13 22:49:27 See it's a reason my daddy always get my oil changed causeee 
7164 2018-01-13 22:49:06 @GaryLineker if you mention Kane or any other Spurs players being sold etc on @BBCMOTD I’m going to pour boiling oil over your precious walkers crisps!!
7165 2018-01-13 22:49:01 Canada has a long history of one company surging to a very large position, distorting the index, and then collapsing in value.  IIRC Inco, ManuLife, Valeant, Blackberry, Nortel, all fit that profile.  Currently the TSX gives you mostly oil and finance companies.
7166 2018-01-13 22:48:59 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?

7169 2018-01-13 22:48:31 With deals that hot, you’re gonna need them Oil Fire girls over there to put it out.
7170 2018-01-13 22:48:27 I got some new oil for my hair.
7171 2018-01-13 22:48:20 I would think you need to oil those old bones with some blue yummies! @BuschBeer
7172 2018-01-13 22:48:19 Bio oil works for mna
7173 2018-01-13 22:48:09 USA: We will create the bad guys.
Erdogan: We will destroy the bad guys.
USA & Erdogan: This lie should last another 5 to 10 years. OIL
7174 2018-01-13 22:47:39 Lemsip drunk  Olbas Oil on pillows  Vapor rub on chest  Lush sleepy moisturiser on arms  If this combo doesn’t give me a restful sleep I don’t know what will 
7175 2018-01-13 22:47:35 Reckon any oil will do, yep!
7176 2018-01-13 22:47:24 My guess is your a late comer to the evolution of this. Bill Clinton funded initial program. It's nuclear extortion with payoffs for yrs

7178 2018-01-13 22:47:08 It's interesting to me how few are discussing potential implications of CNY oil contract for the USD, which is curious given reported launch coming as early as this week.
7179 2018-01-13 22:47:07 He needs cannabis oil. That will cure him
7180 2018-01-13 22:46:36 Renewable energy is the future, drilling for oil and destruction of our environment is not the future @GOP needs to  this Potus from destroying our precious resources, and 
7181 2018-01-13 22:46:27 I have coconut oil and Vaseline, just put it on before bed? I use a moisturizer every day and night already but it's more for oil/spot control but noticed these wrinkles today and shat myself  need something better!
7182 2018-01-13 22:46:20 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
7183 2018-01-13 22:45:53 "Burning oil is a change of state - so you burn more than if it's fuel in a car" ??? What does that mean ?
7184 2018-01-13 22:45:49 And for $99.99 you can subscribe to a year of streaming on Lucas Oil website. Tempting, but I'd never get my money's worth. Hooked on Stockers at an early age. I know you understand. If I had MAVTV I'd watch. Did you see Dave Despain is retiring tonight?
7185 2018-01-13 22:45:44 I keep seeing Ryan come up, but Bryce is killing it with fundraising. We need help in #CA01! Resources are thin, @DougLaMalfa has Super PAC $ from the Kochs, Big Ag, Big Oil, you name it. He has covered for Trump’s racism. We need help in CA01!
7186 2018-01-13 22:45:41 No oil in Sweden- ignorance is bliss....
7187 2018-01-13 22:45:35 My skin feel like a dry potato need pineeb or baby oil asap 
7188 2018-01-13 22:45:32 "Idk just use Olive Oil," -ancient Mediterranean proverb
7189 2018-01-13 22:45:23 Today my older almost caught the house on fire by adding water to hot oil, a week ago I caught my little sister right before she microwaved a metal spoon to "heat it up so I can scoop ice cream better" and then just now my mom tried telling GMO's are extremely bad for you...
7190 2018-01-13 22:45:22 Por suerte la mayoría es más feliz
7191 2018-01-13 22:45:07 Congratulations brother. 

More ahead.
7192 2018-01-13 22:45:07 What kinda oil
7193 2018-01-13 22:44:51 @MrDoylet saltó un dolido primero ste encuesta no es suya segundo el sr ubilla la hizo público tercero si me interesa x la contesto
7194 2018-01-13 22:44:41 I think its time States like NY and Cal to fully embrace Clean Energy by no taxes on Bus and research for development so we lead the World in this Technology.  Let Red States choke on coal and oil.  Then when they are dead we can take over for Civil Country.  Cold but true.
7195 2018-01-13 22:44:39 What about Trader Joe's Wild Salmon Oil capsules?  Thanks.
7196 2018-01-13 22:44:34 1 kg lamb/mutton in 2" pieces

7199 2018-01-13 22:44:21 So this morning my dog spilled a whole gallon of vegetable oil on herself and all over the kitchen.. then proceeded to roll round on the rug and track it all over the house 
7200 2018-01-13 22:44:17 Are the #Falcons covered in baby oil? Wtf. #FlyEaglesFly
7201 2018-01-13 22:44:09 if this is only water, Mars can still escape relatively unharmed)) maybe, scientists should discover oil/gas or something rare/useful/radioactive next??? no one can save this planet from humans in this case,  they will be there tomorrow 
7202 2018-01-13 22:44:03 Showered, oil in my hair, face mask on, fresh pjs and bedding 
7203 2018-01-13 22:44:01 So clean what? What exactly caused fire? Yes clean filter, oil motor so what else?
7204 2018-01-13 22:43:54 うっす！
7205 2018-01-13 22:43:42 The leave in conditioner with their hungry hair oil is my go to combo but I also use the shampoo conditioner and hair mask from time to time. Love the stuff
7206 2018-01-13 22:43:38 FUCK WHERE CAN I GET MY OIL CHANGED ON A SUNDAY
7207 2018-01-13 22:43:25 انا لي اقرباء ولي اخوياء في الحد وقالو نفس كلامك اكثر مايشغلهم القناصين والالغام
7208 2018-01-13 22:43:16 Program funding kickstarted, Bill Clinton.
Ignored by two Admins after that.
South Koreans complacent under U.S wing.
Now it's Trumps fault
7209 2018-01-13 22:43:13 Really? Which one? The one with oil or the ones with out? You aren’t referring to the one that has oil and is not in the EU? Note the word ONE and according to DJT they should be migrating to the US!
7210 2018-01-13 22:42:59 W the right winds and currents you can see the oil slick, for about half a mile, while standing on the deck of the Missouri.
7211 2018-01-13 22:42:39 @urgency EXCUSE ME WHY IS ELIOT PUTTING MARGO IN THE DUNGEON FOR NON SEX REASONS EVEN MAKING SURE SHE HAS HER COCONUT OIL DOESNT MAKE UP FOR IT SHE SAVED YOUR ASS. UNGRATEFUL.
7212 2018-01-13 22:42:05 مقطع مفبرك ركيك والي فبركه على قد حاله ومكثر برسيم اخطاء بالجمله .
7213 2018-01-13 22:41:53 Watching the machinations of the left is akin to watching a high-revving engine with absolutely no oil in the crankcase. It is going to start flying apart any minute and you can't wait to see it happen! 
7214 2018-01-13 22:41:26 I splashed hot oil all over my wrist. great start to a lovely Sunday... -_-
7215 2018-01-13 22:41:23 Energy inevitably creates more value than it consumes; and all forms of energy are subsidized. The subsidies for solar and wind are obvious; but nuclear has been consuming taxpayer dollars for 60+ years, and oil and gas get lucrative tax breaks. There is no free market in energy.
7216 2018-01-13 22:41:18 اخيرا : الحوثي يبحث دائما عن نصر اعلامي معنوي لمقاتليه بنشر العشرات من الفيدوهات المفبركة والغير مكتملة مع الاهتمام بسماع صيحتهم التي تبدو واضحه اعلى من صوت اي اشتباك حقيقي والمعمولة بشكل اكثر من جيد من اي خبير لبرامج تركيب الفيديوهات

7218 2018-01-13 22:41:10 Or pay $100 for Lucas oil tv
7219 2018-01-13 22:41:03 So I def just spent 100$ on CBD oil. I refuse to take meds for anxiety lmao
7220 2018-01-13 22:40:48 There is 0 argument they inherited a downturn. However what policy have they enacted that helped OIL rebound? Not one! Same as it wasn’t their fault it failed! So lets quit pretending the NDP did something magical
7221 2018-01-13 22:40:48 Or increase the cost of Oil, Zinc,Nickel,Tin,Copper, as well as gold and other minerals and metals used in the manufacturing of electronics and cars in the US. While the initial cost would pass Corporations...you can bet THEY have the power through lobbyists to get him to say it
7222 2018-01-13 22:40:41 We might not be sharing definitions, but natural resources are drinking water, food, timber, oil- petrol etc, renewable energy, wool, cotton.  It's the raw inputs to business making products for us and markets are a very good way of distributing them.

7229 2018-01-13 22:39:28 i accidentally got tea tree oil in my mouth
7230 2018-01-13 22:39:27 CBD oil. Give it a shot 
7231 2018-01-13 22:39:11 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
7232 2018-01-13 22:39:10 sounds like MR NO oil ,sell to Europe
7233 2018-01-13 22:39:08 Oil tips from @chefmichy 
- cook with grapeseed oil
- avocado oil makes delicious homemade mayonnaise
- make scallion oil before serving, don’t make ahead of time.

7235 2018-01-13 22:38:33 close friend works for big oil, says everyone has a different attitude with Oil>$60; his mgmt. says price heading to 75-80 next. :)
7236 2018-01-13 22:38:29 Somebody save me some oil. It’s been a minute since I’ve had any and it better be a good batch too.
7237 2018-01-13 22:38:01 I vary between bio oil when I get out of the shower n my face is still wet or a tub of £3 Aldi moisturiser I keep in the car. 
I don't use soap. Ever.
7238 2018-01-13 22:37:30 @NumantianGames Ever hear of game balance? #TheyAreBillions is pretty much impossible to beat a %75 score. Map design is a culprit! Let us make trebuchets and/or allow oil access early. Mayor's are useless! How about airdrops instead? Also, air raid sirens before infected hordes
7239 2018-01-13 22:37:12 Know they have installed sirens with diff tone than tsunami sirens. 
No reports of sirens being activated.
System needs some work for sure
7240 2018-01-13 22:37:08 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
7241 2018-01-13 22:37:02 I've grown them for years and they're beautiful. One of the highlights of the year is eating the first ripe Costoluto, warm from the greenhouse, with the best mozzarella, olive oil and basil.
7242 2018-01-13 22:36:39 Omg yes! How did you do this? Paint? Oil? Tons of patience lol
7243 2018-01-13 22:36:31 @richardbranson Mr. Branson, there are people I love who are going to die if we let the environment collapse, and it's heading there now.  I hope it's not too late to reverse this, but we have to stop fracking, dumping crap anywhere we think no one will notice, and burning oil
7244 2018-01-13 22:36:14 it's all that oil lol !
7245 2018-01-13 22:35:39 95% من الفيديوهات التي ينشرها الحوثي ليس فيها اي عمليات اشتباك حقيقة .. ولايوجد عملية اقتحام حقيقة كامله .. مشهد فيه تفجير ثم اقتحام ثم استيلاء على مستودع كيف يتم الاستيلاء على مستودع بعد تفجير المكان بكامله ثم ان عمر مستودعات الذخيرة لاتكون في الخطوط الامامية
7246 2018-01-13 22:35:33 Lol my parents are from a shithole country...(with gold, boxite, and newly discovered oil reserves the people will never see a dime from)
7247 2018-01-13 22:35:22 Trump came into office with a growing economy and over 70 months of job gains. His intent was to break things. Break Obamacare, break DACA, break anything Bannon tells him to break. Spend 16 billion for a wall?!? More coal and oil. Backward
7248 2018-01-13 22:35:17 Oh, I meant in terms of the character! He wouldn't drive something like a Tesla, he's an oil man. ;)
7249 2018-01-13 22:35:15 And the mysterious 19.5% stake in rosneft that can't be traced? Tillerson aka Wayne tracker is Definitely a mole but Trump is well aware of what's going on. Just needs a russian friendly ceo of oil giant to pull it off.
7250 2018-01-13 22:35:12 Same. Your mom says hi.
7251 2018-01-13 22:34:59 Today we play the team of Oil,

We are at our arena,

Must defend our sacred soil.

7252 2018-01-13 22:34:58 Your gonna need oil money. No one ever found their dream guy at Target either.
7253 2018-01-13 22:34:58 I want my oil and gold miner to do well so I can get out lol
7254 2018-01-13 22:34:57 Best oil dman and still 5 years away from his peak
7255 2018-01-13 22:34:40 But store of value demand flows into silver, oil, and many other commodities with defined utility.
7256 2018-01-13 22:34:38 Something fishy about this, sim. to the oil spills in the gulf years ago when congress considering drilling!
7257 2018-01-13 22:34:20 Not to mention oil bulls gold bulls euro bulls 
7258 2018-01-13 22:34:19 I’ll stick to oil changes, plugs, and airing up the tires!!
7259 2018-01-13 22:34:18 Hey @PatrckStatic 

Thanks to you ive rediscovered Bob Ross and my love of painting! I just went and got more brushes and oil paints (i already had acrylic and im not sure on the water colors yet). So i just wanted to say thank you!
7260 2018-01-13 22:34:18 After 3 days of no sleep I took some ativan, some melatonin,  some mirtazapine and used some lavander essential oil and FINALLY got 4 hours of sleep.
7261 2018-01-13 22:34:09 Eagles got baby oil on their gloves
7262 2018-01-13 22:34:06 Butter is very delicate and doesn't have a very high smoke point (thus why it started smoking lol) Try coconut oil
7263 2018-01-13 22:34:04 Hamet Dia bimeuko wakhé Castor oil dey mayé barbe lako fi guedia guiss mba nanouko dé benn yon ?
7264 2018-01-13 22:33:56 Without the oil money there's no way in hell you could afford to spend £2-300m a season. You couldn't afford a third of that. There's no way you could afford to pay the wages. Without the owners there are no (fake) sponsors
7265 2018-01-13 22:33:30 Says the OIL CLUB fan. 
7266 2018-01-13 22:33:22 OECD oil demand growth for the last 5 years period was near 2.5% (not annualy, for the entire period). At the same time 5Y avg. of OECD stocks (OPEC target) will increase by the end of the 2018 in comparison with the period of 2010-2014 by 11% #OOTT
7267 2018-01-13 22:33:01 Lickable Lover's Oil will be avaliable tomorrow, along with a Lover's Bundle!
7268 2018-01-13 22:32:42 Well crud. Replaced the ICP on my 05 F-350. Still keels over and dies when it gets warmed up. Brand new wiring harness. Brand new ICP. Pretty much leaves a problem in the high pressure oil system. $$$. Ugh. :(
7269 2018-01-13 22:32:39 Hahaha!  Hey, even the Clampetts found oil!

7271 2018-01-13 22:32:30 When it (US Dollar Bill) says ‘In God We Trust’, they not talking about Jehovah, Elohim, Christ, or Allah, they’re talking about Money, Oil, and Drugs. ~@BrotherNuri #MLKDay
7272 2018-01-13 22:32:25 Bro, Saudi sells even cheaper, why because these countries subsidize the price... Give me the federal character act please. Oil price was not the fault of the presidency?
7273 2018-01-13 22:32:14 I saw a chick implying that beard oil is like makeup... When y'all get that retarded?
7274 2018-01-13 22:32:12 صادق . انا اؤكد على كلامك بأن المقطع مفبرك
7275 2018-01-13 22:31:58 One thing in common among the dollar bills is that they all say, “In God We Trust”. But they’re not talking about God. They’re talking about gold, oil, and drugs. ~@BrotherNuri #MLKcelebration #SanAnton2018
7276 2018-01-13 22:31:52 Or we just outlaw the drilling. Working together sounds great until a pipe bursts and there is a massive oil spill. Get yer nose out of Trump's butt and MAN UP.
7277 2018-01-13 22:31:43 Need one of those free oil changes from @Hyundai right about now
7278 2018-01-13 22:31:42 Oil men refusing to spend money.. your off your tiny mind ffs 
7279 2018-01-13 22:31:31 ماعملهاش مع النادي بتاعه
7280 2018-01-13 22:31:25 @richardbranson I don't know if Mr. Musk is actually getting my messages, or if some flunky is laughing and tossing them.  I contacted him because he's wealthy, and could potentially survive the displeasure of the oil barons.
7281 2018-01-13 22:31:24 I use beard oil every day but honestly guys I don’t know what problem I’m solving with it
7282 2018-01-13 22:31:23 If you want to put coconut oil in your hair to leave in overnight, how do you prevent it from smearing all over your pillow?
7283 2018-01-13 22:31:17 @civic duty : France and England provide military protection for Europe or at least, Russia but no USA. 

Soon the USA system (petro-$, weapon, oil, wall-street ...)  will fall down.

Morevee when your systeme will fall down you will not be on the second position (behind China)
7284 2018-01-13 22:31:15 It had to be reinstated because your shithole of a president keeps wanting to compare his 1 inch penis to Kim Lee’s 1 inch penis playing missile  games. Don’t blame Democrats. 
This is all trump trying to get us killed.
7285 2018-01-13 22:31:07 A solemn, but fascinating experience.  You can still smell and see the oil bubbling up from the wreckage 76 years later.  Unreal.
7286 2018-01-13 22:31:06 We  hearing this! Sounds like the pumice powder and coconut oil mixture is working it's heavenly magic! Thanks for sharing the Lush love. 
7287 2018-01-13 22:31:03 Some autistic space bois want the earth to hate them so earth people can unite and then eventually kill them but the illuminati rushes their plan, also one kid gets a princess to like him so she will switch over to clean energy instead of using oil

7294 2018-01-13 22:29:07 Fracking newly recoverable oil & gas deposits with the potential to extend the Petroleum Age an estimated 120 years in North America might be a bit of a stumbling block on the livable planet    front.

LNG exports? Do the math. Ask the scientists. Think.

7296 2018-01-13 22:28:49 College is not simply a vocational experience.  Most coll grads r liberal arts majors.  I was, & had a very successful career inpublishing. Upon graduation, even engineers must be trained. Most allies, most countries, provide education to its citizens thru college, oil or no oil.

7300 2018-01-13 22:28:33 Yet, Trump never said what CNN claims. Durban lied. Why would her parents leave Nigeria, if it is a place of prosperity? I know, corrupt globalist leaders take the oil $$ and put it in Swiss bank accounts! Obama is a selfish Prince Harry buddy globalist who ruined Libya!
7301 2018-01-13 22:28:09 sometimes I put eucalyptus oil in my diffuser and pretend I’m a koala
7302 2018-01-13 22:28:02 Someone just said I have that feeling the way Madrid is going down they would soon discover oil

7303 2018-01-13 22:27:49 Married 25 years and bought first new car and first American made car: ChevyEQUINOX.  Not even 5 years old and engine died on New Years Eve. Timing chain broke; Oil gushed everywhere.  Timing chains aren't supposed to break!  At 128k miles so dealer says, Sorry, Can't Help You!
7304 2018-01-13 22:27:49 The way motoring started off, I doubt that councils would have been involved. By the time petrol became a necessity it would have been very profitable for oil companies.  Charging points are a means of selling electricity, surely the electricity companies should provide them.
7305 2018-01-13 22:27:36 Coconut milk, half teaspoon coconut oil, stick cinnamon, teaspoon turmeric, few peppercorns heat and simmer for 10 mins or longer, sieve, add honey and drink hot - calms a hive mind ....
7306 2018-01-13 22:27:31 I should of change my oil earlier 
7307 2018-01-13 22:27:08 What About Oil?
Oil Source and Use17 min

Oil Source
7308 2018-01-13 22:27:06 I'm in the oil business and oil prices are heading up, largely due to #OPEC cutbacks.   Oilfield employment is considered manufacturing so it is, at least in part, true.  Oil price increases historically have not been considered good by #Wallstreet- just saying....
7309 2018-01-13 22:27:06 ياخواني ياحبابي الذين لم تلدهم امي هذا الوطن غالي علينا نحن ايضا جنود بقلمنا وتغرديدتنا نفضحهم ونعلمهم ان الله حق وكل كلب جرو يروح ليم ديرته
7310 2018-01-13 22:27:02 Oil change . Then going to get the boys some boots 
7311 2018-01-13 22:27:01 Nigeria is sitting on crude oil reserves estimated at 35 billion barrels (enough to fuel the entire world for more than a year), & m100 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Yet no steady light. Fuel Scarcity. Shameful.
7312 2018-01-13 22:26:59 Not if your buying gold or oil
7313 2018-01-13 22:26:56 I been at Wal-Mart since fuckin 3 for an oil change. When someone finally comes to pick me up, they pull my car in. Like fuck y’all.
7314 2018-01-13 22:26:53 oil drilling is regulated so that you can only have one well per x acres and drill at a certain rate, etc, correct? correlative rights?

perhaps we could regulate landlords like that? just pretend the tenants are oil, and they can only be drilled at certain rents per month etc.
7315 2018-01-13 22:26:42 Love the fake tears of liberals. Can't fool me.
7316 2018-01-13 22:26:40 @civic duty : France and England provide military protection for Europe or at least, Russia but no USA. 

Soon the USA system (petro-$, weapon, oil, wall-street ...)  will fall down.

Morevee when your systeme will fall down you will not be on the second position (behind China)
7317 2018-01-13 22:26:24 White Petroleum USA  assume it also in dark. Name it black Petroleum is just an oil. Cocoa butter plantation they invaded first @PresidentIRL i know u kind guilty of failures to educate before settling abroad. charged all same squatters in public services domain ©®™

7320 2018-01-13 22:26:11 Its a good Q. the bottle says Hemp Oil Extract Canabidiol (CBD) 25 mg Other Ingredients medium chain Vitamin E . The 10mg worked well on me.  The 25mg is a bit different effect OR I'm getting use to it .They both come from GoGreen brand 
I don't have access to THC/CBD combo Yet.
7321 2018-01-13 22:26:04 It's like saying you want a portrait painted, with no additional information. Then when mostly done, you say it should be a portrait of a dog, not a person. When that is almost done, you decide it should have been oil paint, not acrylic. And then.. maybe it should be a landscape?
7322 2018-01-13 22:26:04 Cut Wakame and Toasted Sesame Oil are pretty much the most important things in my food world rn. Wonder why we didn't have these when I was growin' up in Iowa.
7323 2018-01-13 22:25:47 Also Laura Mercier translucent setting powder is amazing for oil control and you only need a tiny bit.
7324 2018-01-13 22:25:46 indian shampoo and hair oil commercials are so deceiving bc the actresses are clearly wearing wigs, it’s all fake yet I aspire to have that level of bounce shine and volume 
7325 2018-01-13 22:25:25 @APCUKingdomU can't blame Trump 4 calling us "shithole"we can't refine our oil,we Export cheap raw materials,we steal & bank it Abroad.SAD

7335 2018-01-13 22:23:53 With a few tweaks this would make a great #WFPB recipe. Just get rid of the egg and oil.
7336 2018-01-13 22:23:53 Just put CBD oil on a zit recreationally

7341 2018-01-13 22:23:39 As opposed to the Northeast coast?
7342 2018-01-13 22:23:29 I agree- it's most likely in pill or oil form, nothing sensational
7343 2018-01-13 22:23:22 When you kind of over did it with coconut oil in your hair... it's literally dropping from it. 

But hey it will be all moist and pretty afterwards! 

...

The things I do for my curly hair
7344 2018-01-13 22:23:18 Could you imagine someone who formerly worked in the defence industry, and now the oil and gas industry question the morals to selling arms to the Saudis? Well, believe it or not...
7345 2018-01-13 22:23:07 Too much coconut oil in your eyes 
7346 2018-01-13 22:23:06 Stop financing dangerous oil pipelines! Divest from Bank of America, move your accounts because they are financing dirty polluting leaking pipelines.
7347 2018-01-13 22:22:55 The oil didn't stain your couch or anything did it? 
7348 2018-01-13 22:22:54 I just stopped somewhere to pick up some jojoba oil & as I am paying for it a lady looks at me and says "I love your hat, I noticed it right as you walked in" & I said "Thank you! My friend makes them. Her shop is called moonstorm design, she's on instagram" 
7349 2018-01-13 22:22:41 COME FORTH MONSIGNOR KEVIN MCCOY WITH THE HOST, GUARDIAN OF THE WINE AND THE OIL. (Sorry Eric, they blind me sometimes, but you're still my favorite Trump).

7352 2018-01-13 22:21:54 No its because the implemented socialism by using oil to fund economy but when oil price collapsed so did economy but then the greed of capitalist countries refusing to cut supply to stabalise the price kept it low. Was nothing to do with taking monet off the rich
7353 2018-01-13 22:21:49 Pretty weird tbh, you obviously left a lasting impression
7354 2018-01-13 22:21:45 when u wash ur hair and get all the oil out, such a refreshing feeling
7355 2018-01-13 22:21:38 Can hardly wait for more oil spillage in my old home state!
7356 2018-01-13 22:21:32 おはようチンさん、お疲れ様です！凄いよ！凄い！一日でとかすごい！
7357 2018-01-13 22:21:31 Typical self-loathing snake oil salesman. The Trumpers target these weak guys to peddle their bullshit for them - ‘wheel out that guy, he’ll be this week’s scapegoat’ and he is lapping up the crumbs from their table and wagging his stupid tail like a beaten dog
7358 2018-01-13 22:21:30 Haiti is a #shithole. Niger is ruining their delta with homemade oil refining making it too a #shithole. If you can’t call a  a  then you might as well join the libs #fakeoutrage

7364 2018-01-13 22:20:27 Anyways I need an oil diffuser
7365 2018-01-13 22:20:06 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
7366 2018-01-13 22:20:04 honestly this could have been left unsaid
7367 2018-01-13 22:19:48 Speaker, they are crumbs compared to to the steaks the wealthy received. Big business receives subsides, oil, gas, electric, dairy, etc. they get handouts from the govt but because they are called subsidies we pretend we have a free market. It's really just corporate welfare.
7368 2018-01-13 22:19:42 Well, when someone has been privy to seeing such an amazing sight, one must share how awesome it is, amirite?
7369 2018-01-13 22:19:38 Norway is a welfare petroleum based state . If it was not for the free market capitalist in the free countries that discovered oil and the drilling equipment to retrieve it Norway would just be a fishing village . At least the Haitian people that come here know they have to work
7370 2018-01-13 22:19:29 Morals or ethics. You are kidding right? Do some research on Trump’s business dealings. This man was a snake oil salesman, even before he became president.
7371 2018-01-13 22:19:29 or Cheryl But cuz my @BrookeBCNNdid d "Miracle of d oil" & showed me GOD's 1 John 4:16ONLY my "1st Mrs. Worthington" would do? I told d #HolySpirit I will let my @BrookeBCNNshow me on her Instagram that she no longer wants my Worthington last name w/hers cuz d
7372 2018-01-13 22:19:28 A recent experiment showed not all sat fats are the same - coconut oil is full of it but raises good cholesterol levels...I made my own diet based on nutrition rather than following one diet

7377 2018-01-13 22:18:12 Dont forget that Chinese oil tanker last week. Everyone is hacking everyone everywhere. Its the sole reason all nuclear weapon systems in the US and RF are mechanical. No hacking.

7379 2018-01-13 22:17:40 whats this buzz lately around coconut oil, does it have super powers? 
7380 2018-01-13 22:17:27 N also with drilling in waters. Once the oil gets in those waters the fish markets will have to close or import fish from other countries ( there goes our jobs n business ) as usual there u go helping other countries instead of MAKING AM FIRST. All LIES from beginning . 
7381 2018-01-13 22:17:15 Kind of an oil and water thing with Gowdy and ethics!
7382 2018-01-13 22:17:04 comical.  so much left out, most glaringly smoke point and  subsequent structural changes.  what happens when olive oil ceases to be olive oil from excess heat?  well, it's not good @SophieEganM .
7383 2018-01-13 22:16:56 The problem in Nigeria is the same problem in the US. oligarchs controlling the oil reserves enrich thenselves. Both shitholes?
7384 2018-01-13 22:16:50 2pm meal: Two chicken breast, steamed veggies w olive oil. Next bowl plain yogurt with raw Oates splash of juice with 1/2 scoop protein, creatine, bcaa's pills, water
7385 2018-01-13 22:16:37 Go get some magnesium oil. Have a hot shower then rub down with that shit and lay there and veg. It feels sooo goooood
7386 2018-01-13 22:16:28 They must have oil on there jersey
7387 2018-01-13 22:16:20 Namibia is the result of German colonialism. The Shell Oil company maps are the most popular - British and Dutch. 

Your streets are named after Castro in Winhoek - I know I've been there. 

You think you're free but sadly you are ruled from Europe and taught to hate America.
7388 2018-01-13 22:16:03 This is a false question. They have some of the largest oil reserves in the world. They're not coming here. The refugees you claim run here are a negligible fraction. Do you know how Americans choose live abroad or have dual citizinship?

7394 2018-01-13 22:15:25 I hope when I get older I won't behave like #trump. I'm going to start taking fish oil.
7395 2018-01-13 22:15:23 WOOOOOOW!!! So when niggas call you Adonal Oil, you don’t press them but you press a fellow dark skin? Bet.
7396 2018-01-13 22:15:22 I don’t think there’s much omega 3 in the canned tuna, so gave it up. Salmon is reported to have more. I also use flax seed oil (when I remember!).

I also know that big oil is attacking him at every turn so it makes me suspicious of negative stories. In any event he has got the ball rolling now we have to push it. Solar, batteries EV
7402 2018-01-13 22:14:51 So basically we have jumped from snake oil and cow dung to Misogyny. Nice pull.

7407 2018-01-13 22:13:44 Not at all. Did you miss the part where oil consumption is increasing EVERY year?  Simple choice. The world can choose to buy Canada  friendly oil or buy dictator our from regimes that throw  off Buildings.

7427 2018-01-13 22:10:55 OIL DIFF: 5.57 -> 5.57
7428 2018-01-13 22:10:45 I just had a really good fight in Divinity Original Sin just, I was fighting a Skeleton and his royal entourage of fellow Skeletons and I used teleport to drop his Jester ontop of him whilst he was lying down in a burning oil pit I casted, hilarious
7429 2018-01-13 22:10:33 Just needed a battery and oil change.. I still have a little oil leak but that’s not stopping it from running
7430 2018-01-13 22:10:18 Can't take credit for higher oil prices but thanks for the feedback!
7431 2018-01-13 22:10:14 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
7432 2018-01-13 22:10:00 And with just a few tweets, my timeline is overflowing with the spoiled brats complaining about opinions they don't like over a fictional ship.  Need any other reason to dislike the Oil City fanbase?
7433 2018-01-13 22:09:59 انا شفت المقطع واعتقد انه حقيقي لأن في بداية المقطع كان فيه تبادل لأطلاق النار ..اسأل الله لهم الرحمة والمغفرة
7434 2018-01-13 22:09:59 My favorite Young Living oil is Helichrysum. I tore my rotator cuff and had to have surgery. I used the oil everyday. When I went in for my 6 week follow up, the doctor had to check his paperwork, as he could not find a scar. He thought that he was looking at the wrong shoulder.
7435 2018-01-13 22:09:59 Did you know the people that gets haircuts if it Barbara smart he would donate it to me see what ya oil spills they use it all the time for oil spills why are so many people show negative
7436 2018-01-13 22:09:56 Hope this Lucas oil tv ppv isn't a bust like it has been the last two years.
7437 2018-01-13 22:09:50 @JeffDenham bragged re support of the "Putting Gulf Oil Back to Work Act", making it easier to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. Voted to make drilling easier off the Contintental Shelf. Voted down methane pollution safeguards, efforts to clean up fracking + yes on Artic drilling. 
7438 2018-01-13 22:09:48 Nope, because the car uses the gasoline energy to produce kinetic energy in an efficient way. The thing with oil and gasoline is that they pack a lot of energy in a reduced space, but you can have inefficient machines running on fossil fuel too
7439 2018-01-13 22:09:45 Looking for a great olive oil for dressings and marinades? @chefmichy recommends California Olive Ranch Extra Virgin Olive Oil. @CulinaryCouncil #culinarycouncil #sponsored
7440 2018-01-13 22:09:42 So what Heather is saying: she supports Trump support of child molester Roy Moore. She also supports his support of coal mining, oil drilling. And she supports Trumps blatant racism. Explains a lot about her kind.
7441 2018-01-13 22:09:40 A la mayoría no nos interesa quien sea...
7442 2018-01-13 22:08:58 Find out that in Texas you paid taxes to oil companies if you purchase a electric car!?????
7443 2018-01-13 22:08:51 cutthroat kitchen cracks me up because when the judge tastes one of the contestants food and says something bad, the other contestants giggle and grin to themselves like hehe i’m gonna win and how could you put truffle oil on a club sandwich joe you amateur chef
7444 2018-01-13 22:08:46 Onion or garlic infused oil or wheat free asafetida powder (just need a little) or the green tips of spring onions
7445 2018-01-13 22:08:45 Wow it's almost shocking she's writing this from the only cntry in The Caribbean that isn't a shithole because of its oil money
7446 2018-01-13 22:08:45 Jesus that is some price of oil for the BBC machinery & Establishment to be paying out. Are they worth it ..REALLY???
7447 2018-01-13 22:08:31 how does drilling oil and destroying nature help national security - please explain clearly the connection
7448 2018-01-13 22:08:19 Of rice vinegar.
Glug if olive oil
Add the liquids and herbs to the warm lentils
Seaon to taste
I have it with beetroot and/or avocado.
7449 2018-01-13 22:08:16 This mink oil just brought my boots back to life
7450 2018-01-13 22:08:14 Wow! That’s crazy! Thankfully my moron just knocked some bottles of oil off the shelf.
7451 2018-01-13 22:08:02 The larger concern regarding welfare and healthcare expenditures is the theybare unsustainable and once oil is not just traded in American $$ then you will really see the  hit the fan in this country. Look @ Venezuela...
7452 2018-01-13 22:07:57 Dear people of the world, oil and water are the two things that don't mix well. Oil and vinegar make salad dressing.
7453 2018-01-13 22:07:23 Lol you go to get your oil change and the mechanic will try to tell you a million and one things that’s wrong with your car.
7454 2018-01-13 22:07:19 Nails done and oil change today’s going to be productive

7457 2018-01-13 22:07:00 Think of your product like an organism—growing, shifting, decaying—not an oil painting; a "finished" masterpiece.
7458 2018-01-13 22:06:45 Live in London (with financial clout only) 
Salford would be a hop skip an' a jump away under those circumstances.
Genuinely couldn't envisage being more than weeks absent (financial clout permitting . Otherwise all bets are off)
I need my evening at the Lamp Oil
7459 2018-01-13 22:06:44 My favorite line is from George Will who said of Obama, "If Narcissism Were Oil, This President Would Be Saudi Arabia."
7460 2018-01-13 22:06:38 @MotorTrend Is the #BMWM2's use of oil (a quart at 10K miles) typical for the brand? I ask because I own both a 2017 and a 2003 MB and have only had to oil once in the 14 years I have owned the 2003 E500 from new. Never replaced oil in the 28K miles on the 2017.
7461 2018-01-13 22:06:37 Needs oil cooler and transmission cooler pipes
7462 2018-01-13 22:06:28 Go to Nigerian south south and south west, you’ll find LOTS of Americans working in the Nigerian oil industry.
7463 2018-01-13 22:06:27 "I can give you all the attension you want. Im very good with my hands. Care for a massage to relax those... Tense muscles~?"
*chuckles softly as he grabs a bottle of warm oil*
7464 2018-01-13 22:06:27 I need U to translate Falz's song "How Far" the first verse of the song... "dem say oil dey oya kalo ru kpo? Wetin dat one mean? The chorus sef... chaii I need 2 learn Yoruba asap! Mayb I should get a Yoruba girl 
7465 2018-01-13 22:06:27 Renewable energy wind farm powers of the sea waters move away from nuclear and oil maybe our kids will have a safe world to live In if #Trump doesn't get us all nuked before it #MakeOurPlanetSafeAgain
7466 2018-01-13 22:06:26 why does my car smell like oil and chlorine when i use my heat
7467 2018-01-13 22:06:26 They are resting comfortably in the fridge coated in Salt/Pepper and olive oil.  The need some alone time for a few hours...
7468 2018-01-13 22:06:21 Except after the inauguration O’s economic regs were removed, burdensome bearaucracy in oil drilling, business formation, etc was removed, reduced taxes on businesses is bringing them back with their overseas money...keep trying, bud.
7469 2018-01-13 22:06:14 I’m $60 away from hitting $24k in sales for the week...SOMEONE COME GET AN OIL CHANGE AND MAKE MY WEEK
7470 2018-01-13 22:06:13 asparagus is sooooooo good dude. sprinkle them with a lil salt and pepper and roast with olive oil and minced garlic and yummmmmmmmmmm
7471 2018-01-13 22:06:04 O'Donnell: Chocolate and peanut butter, or oil and water: YES #NACVGM
7472 2018-01-13 22:06:03 That became clear the second he opened up all off shore oil drilling except around Florida - they asked nice...
7473 2018-01-13 22:05:59 * snake oil
7474 2018-01-13 22:05:51 I need to the @PortofSeattle restricted from storing and/or servicing oil economy equipment. 
That is something @JayInslee and state government @washdems need to do something about since the Port is their creation.
Can you support that, Patty?
@kcexec @MayorJenny @SeattleCouncil
7475 2018-01-13 22:05:42 I’m always sticking my finger in boiling water or oil to check the temp. Life of a culinary major.
7476 2018-01-13 22:05:28 Has anyone tried that UFO face oil before I drop $80
7477 2018-01-13 22:05:14 It's not a hoax. Even Trump knows that. So does Tillerson. It was confirmed by the oil industry in the early 60s. It was warned about by Thomas Edison. It's your problem that you don't bother with facts.
7478 2018-01-13 22:05:14 I’ve seen so many pics on here of destructive ass children. Imagine palm oil all over your cocaine leather sofas 
7479 2018-01-13 22:04:50 These dudes at Jiffy Lube really bout charged me 80$ for just an oil change...talking about "vacuuming carpet and putting air in my tires...THAT AINT AN EXTRA 40$. but oh well..
7480 2018-01-13 22:04:43 @pastormarkburns add snake oil salesman to your resume'
7481 2018-01-13 22:04:42 year 2006 to 2009 "bad batch" anything after are fine . The cars I've mentioned are a little more expensive, but you will have more miles out of them and less down time, but be sure to change the your oil every 10000 or year whatever comes 1st
7482 2018-01-13 22:04:37 Why is there an oil rig just off the coast of Nags Head...
7483 2018-01-13 22:04:31 Framing the argument is valid point. Left does this by applying terms like undocumented and generically referring to all as immigrants.
7484 2018-01-13 22:04:15 “Without those oil companies, New Yorkers would have frozen in their homes in the bitter cold of the past week, and Mr de Blasio would not be able to ride an SUV to the gym every weekday.” - @FT @BilldeBlasio

7487 2018-01-13 22:03:59 I’ve been using japanisch peppermint oil for my face and the first two minutes it feels like your face is burning off but then it cools your whole face
7488 2018-01-13 22:03:57 This is not just about oil I believe it's more to it than that I just threw the oil situation out there to see if somebody can catch it but let's stay on the body counts
7489 2018-01-13 22:03:54 the oil, always.
7490 2018-01-13 22:03:51 "Creativity and Technology: Chocolate and Peanut Butter, or Oil and Water?" @MartyTheElder has begun his talk at #NACVGM
7491 2018-01-13 22:03:49 Spilled a whole bottle of peppermint oil in my backpack and all over my stuff

7497 2018-01-13 22:02:27 As I pointed out in a letter to the ABQ Journal that appeared last week, since 1999 Pearce has taken over 2 million from oil and gas and 300k from Club for Growth, aka the Koch Brothers.
7498 2018-01-13 22:02:22 Mi abuelita cuando le hablo de mi cabello se descontrola, me compro toda la linea de "Argan Oil"... Esto me gusta.
7499 2018-01-13 22:02:15 I brought my car for an oil change last week and I’m still shitty about the disapproving tone in the guys voice when he told me I was missing 3 out of 4 hubcaps.... as if I didn’t already know this.... leave me alone guy
7500 2018-01-13 22:02:08 And when I got out of college the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam were raging. Watergate was starting, there were no jobs for women, and women couldn't have a credit card in their name. There was a severe oil/gas crisis, and I didn't have an IPhone but I had fun and I made it
7501 2018-01-13 22:02:00 Coconut oil work wonders
7502 2018-01-13 22:01:52 European immigrants turned this once prestine land into a filthy water, air polluted, oil wasted, concrete jungle shithole.
7503 2018-01-13 22:01:50 All that oil. Will run out soon enough.
7504 2018-01-13 22:01:34 Next up: our #NACVGM keynote! Marty O'Donnell, "Creativity and Technology: Chocolate and Peanut Butter, or Oil and Water?"
7505 2018-01-13 22:01:32 January 13, 2018 at 05:01PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7506 2018-01-13 22:01:23 Oil is so exasperating.
7507 2018-01-13 22:00:46 Mix 4 1/2 tbsps zucchini with 3 cups dates. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Drain. Serve on bread

7516 2018-01-13 21:59:16 Go to Nigerian south south and south west, you’ll find LOTS of Americans working in the Nigerian oil industry.
7517 2018-01-13 21:59:15 Leading researchers have concluded butter is, on balance, good for you but many 'experts' are still following the old guidance, now superseded, that eating saturated fats raises your cholesterol levels. They made the same mistake with eggs and, more recently, with coconut oil.
7518 2018-01-13 21:59:13 Baking soda, lemon juice, coconut oil
7519 2018-01-13 21:59:12 God help me if I ever need to return to #nationwide @Nissan in Timonium. Three hours to change oil and rotate tires is ridiculous. And the “free car wash” came complete with bird droppings and a scratch on my 6 month old car.

7521 2018-01-13 21:58:50 I don’t know why but going to get an oil change gives me so much anxiety.
7522 2018-01-13 21:58:33 Assassins Creed camel thoughts: I felt bad since every time I tried to get on, I ended up hitting him with my hammer. But I just witnessed him setting himself (and me) on fire bc he dragged jars of oil through a campfire and then ran through it. We are a perfect match.

7524 2018-01-13 21:58:09 Sorry he didn't sugar coat PR deficiencies prior to hurricane. The back and forth was with a full blown socialist. Cause of problems

7527 2018-01-13 21:57:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
7528 2018-01-13 21:57:31 Uh huh. Now tell your followers what Norway’s population is. How many immigrants do they let in?  That they have trillions in oil wealth to divvy among a few. The comparison is idiotic.
7529 2018-01-13 21:57:12 putting coconut oil on my face
7530 2018-01-13 21:57:03 Got a coffee + vanilla scrub, almond oil, and a bottle of aloe gel from TjMaxx for $20. They’re undefeated.
7531 2018-01-13 21:56:57 Yeah, Nestle stealing our Water, Zinke wanting to "free" the Cascades, lets bring in big oil to drill off our Coasts and threaten our way of life... all these bring ZERO to the people of OR, unless you count costs of clean up?
7532 2018-01-13 21:56:51 Coconut oil that ish!

7538 2018-01-13 21:55:02 No they are not. The ones under TPS are fighting it. Still over 1, 000 ppl a day crossing border, and those just ones that are caught
7539 2018-01-13 21:54:58 Have you tried bolognese pasta? It’s really delicious with tofu - you just have to put the tofu into a pan and heat it up in some oil and onions before adding the tomatoes and herbs. 
7540 2018-01-13 21:54:23 You should see Penn&Teller's Bullshit episode on recycling.  It turns out a 30 square mile area can contain all human waste for the foreseeable future.  And transporting plastics wastes more oil than was used to make the plastic.
7541 2018-01-13 21:54:11 The global  average price has nothing to do with Nigeria's price, if so Venezuela sells even cheaper. Federal character is in our Constitution. The dabble in oil price is a systematic plot to hurt Nigerians.
7542 2018-01-13 21:54:05 coconut oil & @SoapandGlory exfoliator

7575 2018-01-13 21:49:23 @tvcnewsng Oil sector is very strategic to the economy. The president should allow a competent appointee to manage and run the industry.
7576 2018-01-13 21:49:23 so i just painted two hours with oil colors and let me say you this is pain in the ass when you have like 3 colors but need 15
7577 2018-01-13 21:49:07 First of all, there's no act in the constitution that says even distribution..... Fall in oil price plunged us into recession, so that answer your question! Research the average price of PMS on the global market!
7578 2018-01-13 21:49:05 Only 63 stores closed nationwide, and some will be revamped into e commerce sites and others will not reopen due to market saturation. In the meantime, WalMart is burning the midnight oil to find employment for the affected employees.

7581 2018-01-13 21:48:58 It's true to say there is increased interest in M&A activity.  Unfortunately there is no guarantee this will lead to new exploration work or an increase in supply chain activity. It's just shifting money around.
7582 2018-01-13 21:48:48 I always use a serum, and then an oil if I need to. Is this correct or should I be choosing between the oil and serum? @CarolineHirons
7583 2018-01-13 21:48:33 What, because I call out the oil? They suck! Block me if you want, couldn’t care less.
7584 2018-01-13 21:48:30 who can change the oil on my car?? I’ll pay you!!
7585 2018-01-13 21:48:27 Norway ? Really ? Norway is just a Petro   state . If it was not for the free market capitalist in the free capitalist countries that discovered oil and the drilling equipment to access the oil , Norway would just be a fishing village .
7586 2018-01-13 21:48:13 My grandpa woke up early today on his day off, changed my oil, put a new battery in my car, and filled up my gas tank. He is and always will be the best man in my life, I hope I marry someone half the man he is
7587 2018-01-13 21:48:10 Just make sure it doesn't have a lot of sizzle, no oil and all.
7588 2018-01-13 21:47:49 I can't think of any world where there are confirmed no tectonic plates or mass extinctions but there's still oil. For D&D at least, there ARE dinosaurs and there have been past mass extinctions.

Now I'm thinking of magic oil made from an past race of extinct wizards.
7589 2018-01-13 21:47:36 Is that better or worse than engine oil?

7591 2018-01-13 21:47:07 It’s strange how nobody bats an eyelid if it’s oil money spent on agent fees but it’s back page news if you want to spend money you’ve made from income.

7595 2018-01-13 21:46:30 Peak oil refers to the point of time when oil production (based on known resources at the time) is maximum- peaks. It did not assume technological advances and was never as sophisticated a concept that is being made out to be.

7603 2018-01-13 21:45:44 I was looking for the cut because it did look like either flank or skirt. We always marinated flank with herbs and vinegar and olive oil overnight. But we broiled or grilled on both sides for a short time. How was the tenderness of the meat with a roast of an hour? Just curious.

7605 2018-01-13 21:45:42 You do realize taxes in Norway are significantly higher than US.  Its just how you want to pay for education and healthcare.  Norway is a significant oil exporter so it ok to cause global warming to send your kids to school for free?

7626 2018-01-13 21:42:14 Two of those photos are of literal landfills, a place where people purposely place their trash so the rest of the country can stay beautiful.

7652 2018-01-13 21:38:12 Norway has a population of approx 6 million people and is rich in oil and other natural resources. Norway in the late 60s by found huge reserves of oil in North Sea. They funnel the profits into a national investment fund and is one of the biggest investment funds in the world.

7671 2018-01-13 21:35:34 They do. Most of these so called jobs Americans won't do/ don't want to do are entry level low wage, menial jobs. Not careers.
7672 2018-01-13 21:35:27 And Norway has guaranteed income from selling oil to everyone.
7673 2018-01-13 21:35:08 Also somalia has a lot of sea land and a lots of livestocks, from which we can build big ports, export fish and livestock and make money. We shouldn't rush into oil and gas. They Will bring so many bad things with them. It's better and more assuring to start from bottom.

7694 2018-01-13 21:33:02 3-3
so the old formula has to be adjusted for the new reality. Also, some of the oil is supplied on demand. You do not need that much storage. we see in the #natgas market. My formula shows that storage is not as bullish as shown in traditional forward cover formula.

7713 2018-01-13 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7714 2018-01-13 21:29:59 had a panic attack,  felt like self harming but stopped myself from doing so.  huge step for me and one i've never made before.  so many will not understand how hard it is when your in such term oil without proper support.
7715 2018-01-13 21:29:37 Better than Moroccan oil!!
7716 2018-01-13 21:29:22 Watching a person twist interpretation of scripture to fit a narrative that they, the interpreter, supports, is self serving. Joy calling pastor out, calling him to task, unmasked his character that was hiding behind his interpretations of the word. Snake oil salesmen got fanged.
7717 2018-01-13 21:29:19 whoever swore and cursed Nigeria with wicked and dead brain leaders was very mean. When you go to Rwanda  for instance who has no drop of oil then you know that we need to  get our PVC and get really involved.
7718 2018-01-13 21:29:05 The one that bombed women and children in the middle east for oil control?
7719 2018-01-13 21:29:04 Frack off Mar-a-Lago---Michael Moore threatens to do just that and suddenly Rump says No to additional oil production off of Florida's coast.

7721 2018-01-13 21:28:46 You have to admit, tho, that the pressure was way down from, say, 1962. I remember YEARS in the 90s when 'sea of fire' might mean 'Oh. Another oil spill.' And they didn't even catch fire that much.
7722 2018-01-13 21:28:44 Coconut oil worked for us.
7723 2018-01-13 21:28:42 Prick!! Oil money, buying the league, bla bla bla! Ask him to name the team that won the league in ‘93. Let’s see how many of that team wasn’t bought!
7724 2018-01-13 21:28:38 Great picture. Goes right up there with the burning/exploding Chinese tanker, the Exon Valdez, the spill in South Dakota, the numerous oil covered sea otters, dead and dieing sea birds in LA & CA, etc., etc., ad nauseum.
7725 2018-01-13 21:28:31 i sat to under the canopy to get my oil changed for 20 MINUTES BEFORE I PARKED AND WENT INSIDE AND NOW THEY DECIDE TO GO HELP PEOPLE angry
7726 2018-01-13 21:28:17 Peter Dale Scott's conception of the Deep State as the confluence of powerful interests from intelligence agencies, the military, and corporate America includes the revolving door of individuals like Big Oil Tillerson from positions outside to inside of government.

7729 2018-01-13 21:27:42 Surely not? Nothing more natural than soy beans from which the oil has been extruded, the bean ground, the protein extracted, the tofu heated and packaged... 
7730 2018-01-13 21:27:38 Cookin up oil base dope got residue all on the blue face Rollie.
7731 2018-01-13 21:27:34 I love argan oil! So perfect for every moisturizer need and smells so great too!
7732 2018-01-13 21:27:32 I currently use the Creme of Nature Argan Oil line (Shampoo, Conditioner, Co-wash & Apple cider vinegar), organic coconut oil and wild growth hair oil and moisturizer.
7733 2018-01-13 21:27:28 I like olay body wash ... that shower and coconut oil got me feeling all good .
7734 2018-01-13 21:27:15 orangutan decline in numbers due to palm oil trees being cleared thousands the home of orangutans please dont buy products perhaps the farmers need some other help for different crops sad to see decline in numbers.
7735 2018-01-13 21:27:04 OMG so embarrassing! We will ship to you ASAP. Just orange oil and allspice extract? Luckily those are both for one cocktail so you can just make the other two in the meantime!
7736 2018-01-13 21:26:47 Finally there's patent medicine just for us! But has it been tested against emu oil with hemp (my all-time fav ridiculous supplement).
7737 2018-01-13 21:26:38 Beasts are annoying.

1. Clinique Take The Day Off cleansing balm
2. Regular Cleanser 
3. Tone 
4. Treatment 
5. Moisturise 

Alternate the Clinique Balm with Garnier Micellar Water (pink top). Sometimes I use coconut oil to remove makeup. Never wipes!
7740 2018-01-13 21:26:30 I wasn't pretending - I don't know whether oil will be $20 or $200 in 2020. Guess is somewhere closer to the first, but maybe not by much.
7741 2018-01-13 21:26:12 Mike: mom we’re gonna have to wait for that oil chance until tomorrow, we’re going to overtime. 

Dad: yeah sorry.
7742 2018-01-13 21:25:50 I have this reaction on basically everything I pick up to check in stores. And then eggs... And then non sustainable palm oil... Ek. Good luck with the milks. I use mainly soya, but like oat and almond too.
7743 2018-01-13 21:25:45 my family in houston are die hard bush fans -working in oil.. voting anything different than may cost you your job-... dont worry about it.
7744 2018-01-13 21:25:39 Skincare nerd here!  They're not bad at all. ^°^ Its just better in the long run to use oil based cleansers to fight blackheads
7745 2018-01-13 21:25:38 anyone want to change my oil ? $5 and a happy meal
7746 2018-01-13 21:25:28 Whataburger and oil.
7747 2018-01-13 21:25:17 The mindset that thinks oil producing communities don't deserve resource control is also the same mindset that thinks it is entitled to other people's land for cattle grazing.

Yesterday it was oil, today it's farms. Tomorrow it'll be tech.

No property rights, no prosperity.....

7749 2018-01-13 21:25:10 Ugh I do this to myself all the time. There seems to be lots of fab ways to deal with it from the outside here, but whenever this happens to me I take a lot of fish oil, vitamin e & collagen supplements and eat a lot of berries & kale to speed up the healing process from inside.

Also Lord Jesus; give me oil in my lamp keep me burning, give  me oil in my lamp I pray, keep me burning til the break of day. Sing Hosanna...
7756 2018-01-13 21:23:25 Coal and oil (or rather their continued burning w/out CCS) are a real threat. Nobody's having fun here. Nuke industry screw ups combined w mis-guided US gov policies have left US nuke energy in a bad spot: expensive & w a bad rep. Meanwhile #pricecarbon to help existing plants.

7763 2018-01-13 21:22:44 Cover fx natural finish oil free foundation! It’s a medium coverage but you can build it to be as full as you like!
7764 2018-01-13 21:22:24 They not only won’t make good on their paltry offer of doing taxes on a postcard, they will be giving huge tax breaks or no taxes to their donors and themselves Also, they have hidden  the fact they will give our national refuge lands to oil companies for drilling.
7765 2018-01-13 21:22:23 Excellent point that Frankie missed in his diatribe.  Many highly degreed people not returning to help get their countries get out of poverty.  If Nigeria didn’t squander their oil wealth every citizen would have an awesome living standard.
7766 2018-01-13 21:21:49 Not in IEO -- it only considers oil price and GDP side cases.
7767 2018-01-13 21:21:45 Olive oil: In my hand, let's face it:

7777 2018-01-13 21:20:55 I hope to foster a healthy discourse with even those whose views differ from mine.  We share this country & planet & so need to learn to speak & listen & seek to understand what drives our views in order to come to an accord that benefits us all.  Also a homework break.  ;)
7778 2018-01-13 21:20:51 If there are nations with oil reserves doing business with ExxonMobil and they threaten to take their business to the Russians/Chinese; then he'll be GONE.
7779 2018-01-13 21:20:36 Coconut oil and jojoba oil feels so lovely on my skin.
7780 2018-01-13 21:20:35 Nutrients inside, so mix rosehip oil 3 or 4 drops with rose water and slather. 10. Sunscreen. Koreans are manic for it apparently. 

So this is rough skeleton. Get required products based on skin needs. Cleansing, toning, moisturizing is everyday, morn and nite. Others as needed.
7781 2018-01-13 21:20:33 Hey, speaking of gushing, @Interior and @NatlParkService, @SecretaryZinke and his oil industry cronies are also gushing over HR3990 and the prospect of shrinking national monuments and drilling for huge profits. #Resist and save our #NationalParks
7782 2018-01-13 21:20:26 No 2014 proved most Scottish born voted Yes. Over 65yrs and Scots born elsewhere in UK voted No. Why would any Scot vote to be ruled from Westminster? They have dragged economy down given away oil gas and undermining Scottish producers. #indyref

7788 2018-01-13 21:19:35 Don't believe what you read or hear,in the Seventies during the oil embargo we were told that the country was going to run out of oil,last year under  the Republican administration they allowed oil companies to sell oil in world market. Go figure
7789 2018-01-13 21:19:21 Ok Venezuela economy was reliant on selling oil and price collapsed taking economy with it. Price has recoverd some but still no where near what it was
7790 2018-01-13 21:19:16 Nothing like running out of oil 2 days before your delivery is scheduled.

7795 2018-01-13 21:19:01  Snake oil salesman @pastormarkburns got his ass handed to him by @amjoyshow using biblical verse against his own self-loathing racist views.  Seek help “pastor “. You pick & choose verses to suit your financial needs, you greedy, disgusting trump sucking bozo.
7796 2018-01-13 21:19:00 Isn't the seasonal change due to chemicals  oxydizers rather than different grades of crude? I believe the Gulf shore refineries were built spec-tuned to Saudi oil, probably part of the petro-dollar deal with them.
7797 2018-01-13 21:18:43 Yes thats all ive used then in so far is oil
7798 2018-01-13 21:18:41 I just read in my #APUSH textbook that lumber companies resisted conservation movements to protect forests in the 19th century. That reminds me of the oil companies of today...

7806 2018-01-13 21:18:04 Fragile is right. Sneeze on it and it's broke. I would never want a car that costs over a grand to change the oil.

7810 2018-01-13 21:16:41 With the way GEJ squandered funds, how would he have run the country when oil got down to less than $30? I strongly believe it would've been worse.

7825 2018-01-13 21:15:03 No such thing as "free" medical services in any socialist country, tax money in most socialist countries pay for their medical services instead of most of their tax money going towards subsidies for oil companies and their military industrial complex.

7830 2018-01-13 21:13:40 Used the cream and it's good for scars (not deep ones though) and black marks .. only problem is that it really dries up your skin. But the oil should be better as it's mixed with carrier oils so it shouldn't dry up the skin like the cream.

7835 2018-01-13 21:13:10 You certainly have a valid point. How trump was voted in office can be attributed to the out-dated electorate vote, Kremlin hacking or people that were taken in by trump’s facade.

$2000 to fix it.
7840 2018-01-13 21:12:24 Yup. Fyi, because I had a hard time figuring it out…those steaming ponds are oil pools. I ran around the map my first few times trying to find oil and it was right there in front of me.

7845 2018-01-13 21:11:38 We are not from "shithole countries". Rather, we are from countries rich in natural resources such as gold, oil, manganese that fuel the economy of the US. Countries blended with different cultures, languages & filled with the beauty of this world. - We are from AFRICA!
7846 2018-01-13 21:10:58 put peppermint oil in my bath to steam out this cold, bit heavy handed and I may as well be bathing in listerine & everything burns
7847 2018-01-13 21:10:52 Ironic that Trump did not want wind mills offshore of his golf courses but thinks oil rigs off every shore of U.S. is just fine. It will go nowhere just like his other harebrained ideas
7848 2018-01-13 21:10:51 i did my first adult thing yesterday and got an oil change and then proceeded to fill my tank and now i have a wooping $24 in my account, but it’s cool.
7849 2018-01-13 21:10:48 point in case, the tax received by the government from the female workforce of Norway is greater than the revenue created by oil.

7855 2018-01-13 21:10:27 I need to learn how to change my own oil 
7856 2018-01-13 21:10:25 I've seen it done. Triple-fried, thick, chunky chips. Should have been heaven. Unfortunately they clearly never changed the oil. Fucking rank.
7857 2018-01-13 21:10:17 ฟ้าก็เช่นกันนะ อิอิ
7858 2018-01-13 21:10:16 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。

7862 2018-01-13 21:09:48 How did I not know of this? Better than regular oil for seasoning cast iron? Or just for damaged cast iron pans?

7864 2018-01-13 21:09:31 get an essential oil diffuser and some lavender essential oil. you’re welcome.
7865 2018-01-13 21:09:22 My mom got me some essential oil called "Mental Focus" for my diffuser (also a gift from her) so needless to say, this will almost assuredly be my best academic semester yet.  #watchout
7866 2018-01-13 21:09:14 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
7867 2018-01-13 21:08:59 Raul is leaving for the oil field, Alex is leaving for the Air Force, and all my friends are graduating...I’m depressed
7868 2018-01-13 21:08:36 Boring oil change
7869 2018-01-13 21:08:33 They've got almond milk and coconut oil, but it's fun.
7870 2018-01-13 21:08:32 Hilarious observation.

7872 2018-01-13 21:08:11 How to change the oil in your car.  How to tie a bow tie.  How to do oragami.  How to do my daughter’s hair.  Swing trainer for golf or baseball.  I want all the things.
7873 2018-01-13 21:08:01 Yes...after Europeans steal all of the resources, destroy national lines and politically interfere in local governance there are wars and violence.  How about y'all give back all the gold, oil, diamonds and money you made off of us and let's see how things develop?

7876 2018-01-13 21:07:23 Rrrrrr... I forgot the feta cheese! I cut it into cubes and put it in a 16oz jar with olive oil and powdered herbs & spices.  Oh well!
7877 2018-01-13 21:07:08 Never forget to check your oil level
7878 2018-01-13 21:07:01 What fossils these movies are!  The sprocket holes were hand carved!  The sound was recorded on wax cylinder!  The soundstages were lit with whale oil lamps!

7882 2018-01-13 21:06:44 It’s super easy. For the oven,I line a baking sheet with foil, brush with olive oil and put salmon skin side down. Set the rack just above center. Key is high heat,short time..

7886 2018-01-13 21:06:20 gotta recount a tale of me talking to a british columbian oil driller about his trip to norway sometime.
7887 2018-01-13 21:06:13 No. Gold and Oil transactions globally are conducted in $. USD is the International Reserve Currency. Market is massive and liquid. US military backs up the international trade framework, etc.

In contrast, $BTC is dependent on finding a “greater fool” to pay you for it.
7888 2018-01-13 21:05:58 Before bathing your dog put a drop of mineral oil in your dog's eyes to protect them from suds.
7889 2018-01-13 21:05:56 Or you could look at facts there economy built on oil. Oil price collapsed economy collapsed pretty simply. Political view was not the reason. Failure to diversify was
7890 2018-01-13 21:05:51 Reason I canceled my trip to Croatia is that I am not a big fan of INA having sold perhaps the most talented and finest oil extracting firm for “peanuts,” only to lend some money again from the EU Goverment to buy new Iphones and Cars. Bad deal. Wanted me to believe in changes!
7891 2018-01-13 21:05:37 Redline oil LMFAO
7892 2018-01-13 21:05:26 //it sounds good 

but anything too greasy kind of makes me sick, not in a bad way, i just can't handle too much oil or grease
7893 2018-01-13 21:05:21 I’m quite American. You just shot yourself by citing a wiki that discussed the impact of the global economy...namely China, UK and the global price of oil.  But nice try. Obama or any President does not affect price of crude. Pay attention.
7894 2018-01-13 21:05:20 Before you had a choice of what oil you wanted. Most newer cars already have it in there or you have to use synthetic oil. Rake the price up. Boom. I used to sell paint the same way lol
7895 2018-01-13 21:05:09 Where is the evidence that Nigeria isn’t a shithole ? What works in Nigeria ? Is it light ? Is it politics ?is it oil and gas ? Nothing is working and the truth is we are the ones that made this insults get to us !!! Let’s open our eyes and start doing better till we get to best
7896 2018-01-13 21:05:08 Considering that most of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, wouldn't that country have been the logical target to invade and obtain their oil?
7897 2018-01-13 21:05:07 Research the 1985 Barcelona Declaration. Prior to that 1975 the west was blackmailed over the need for oil there is a vid on youtube somewhere

7902 2018-01-13 21:04:19 I forgot that I put lavender oil on this morning. I've been periodically catching something that smells heavenly all day. Oh, right, fuck yeah. That's me. #lavendarfordays
7903 2018-01-13 21:04:17 I spend over 60 bucks for gas and oil changes But do I want a smaller car? Nope
7904 2018-01-13 21:04:14 Over the course of a year, the average American uses 22.27 barrels of oil.
7905 2018-01-13 21:04:10 same thing worked for the arab league before the formation of OPEC, with the west underpaying for oil while using proxy wars to destabilize the region, the cartel was first met with opposition from many including economists saying itd hurt the poor the most
decades later...
7906 2018-01-13 21:04:01 My oil change changed into needing to get two new tires.  At least I brought my book with me!  #ReadYourFaceOff
7907 2018-01-13 21:03:59 Yes. Yell at me over your chicken tenders that I literally have probably spent a total of 30 minutes making between tenderizing, cutting, breading, and then frying them for the proper amount of time. They're not burned, it's brown because that's the color of the fry oil. Smh
7908 2018-01-13 21:03:54 This girl looks like she threw the whole coconut oil in her hair & didnt wash it #greasybitch

7910 2018-01-13 21:03:48 When you come to do a oil change and out of no where your car needs a whole new make over just chill and do my oil change
7911 2018-01-13 21:03:41 Do you think there were lost jobs in oil and gas because the price fell by half?
7912 2018-01-13 21:03:28 FGM is not Islamic. 
Hate preaching mosques are funded by Saudi A. Why does the west allow them to build those mosques if they dont profit from war? Why are they still giving weapons? And if you wanna say ‘oil’ lol the west can easily invade they’re already bombing 8 countries

7921 2018-01-13 21:02:52 And mineral leasing for “coal, phosphate, sodium, potassium [potash], oil, oil shale, gilsonite (including all vein-type solid hydrocarbons), or gas” under federal lands is governed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. §§ 181 et seq.)
7922 2018-01-13 21:02:51 That's the truth.
7923 2018-01-13 21:02:49 1/ There seems to be this misconception by a lot of people I would normally deem as really smart that Oil and Gas is something that can be disrupted.
7924 2018-01-13 21:02:28 He don't really care . He is worth a fortune and if he chooses to sell the club (which he won't) . He will make a massive profit . We had issues with the Coates family before and he sold out to Icelandic consortium . All other teams sell out to oil rich Arabs . Alarm bells ring
7925 2018-01-13 21:02:25 Or add olive oil and black pepper for a tasty little salad dressing
7926 2018-01-13 21:01:54 this is what socialism does to you, you starve the people and that is what is happening in the larger cities and I would do the same thing to feed my child. They are such an oil rich country....what the hell
7927 2018-01-13 21:01:45 The ‘green’ movement needs to understand that fracking is just another technology making production of oil and gas cheaper and more efficient. Like any new technology, it needs to be regulated. We need cheap gas to kill off dirty coal before we turn to all renewable energy.
7928 2018-01-13 21:01:42 every house in Canada should be fitted with a 50 gallon old oil drum for a burn barrel. neighbours could clamour around it while complaining about snow shovelling and stay warm. off to break up some old furniture to start the fire.

7933 2018-01-13 21:00:43 You do realise that oil prices have risen for every country? Your Educationally sub normal Paul.
7934 2018-01-13 21:00:33 A fact is a fact, the cost of establishing a fact is finite.

7940 2018-01-13 20:58:39 Oil is a highly toxic substance that's responsible for killing and destroying humans, animals and our planet. THAT'S THE TRUTH!
7941 2018-01-13 20:58:20 I've not been blocked yet. I'll send along any messages, but this essential oil stuff is such a ridiculous racket. It's a shame some people are so utterly duped.

7945 2018-01-13 20:56:57 Me trying to check my oil is an epic fail . Tooo short either way 
7946 2018-01-13 20:56:57 article should have been, which do you prefer, lard, butter or coconut oil only safe oils you can heat.
7947 2018-01-13 20:56:48 I hope these oil companies stop delivering all oil products to NY and ya know, save the planet. 
7948 2018-01-13 20:56:35 No its was the collapse of the oil that caused Venezuela's crisis. Oil price crash do to over production and capitalist countries refusing to cut supply to stabilise oil price.

Yes it is up right now, but so is our trade deficit, so is the price of oil and gas, and new jobs are beginning to slide. All thanks to you two. You have antagonized our trade partners, angered the middle east, hurt us!
7951 2018-01-13 20:55:55 Yea what ever go sell your snake oil somewhere else

I have sensitive skin and I never break out with it, it actually makes my skin look betterI’ve already used 3 bottles so I highly recommend
7954 2018-01-13 20:55:24 in an effort to become Skinny i shredded a bunch of squash and cooked it w a lil olive oil n salt and it’s not that bad tbh
7955 2018-01-13 20:55:19 They killed it right off, basically started going downhill the day they took over. Chips were shite and batter was either undercooked or done in dirty oil
7956 2018-01-13 20:55:14 It'll die naturally. Oil will never recover. The overt hostility Buhari triggered has destroyed certain beliefs people tried to hold on to. It is over, man.
7957 2018-01-13 20:55:06 Paid bills
Bought groceries 
Changed oil in car
Got laid

7960 2018-01-13 20:54:39 Snowblower fowled its spark plug out and refuses to start. I am thinking I need to drain the oil and gas mix but I'm not strong enough to tip it over. I'm also too tired to shovel the entire driveway. I guess what I'm saying is that I'm fine in front of this space heater.
7961 2018-01-13 20:54:24 They do and it's a good thing, but at great cost. The Norwegian oil is a substantial part of the state's income.

Myself, i think that majors of "strategic" value, such as engineering, should be free, but one should have to pay for oneself if studying French medieval literature.
7962 2018-01-13 20:54:18 Been 2hrs since I started work and I already spilt coffee on my white pants, water down my face and shirt... oh and I never noticed an oil stain from my hot pocket this morning that got onto my shirt... kms

7974 2018-01-13 20:53:05 Good start to the 2nd. Mullen ties it up 1-1
7975 2018-01-13 20:53:04 Whole flax seeds contain both the fiber + oil, giving you all the nutritional value in one. Add 2 Tbsp ground flax seed to a Green Smoothie!
7976 2018-01-13 20:52:54 You need to write another book so I can have something to read at Costco while I get an oil change.
7977 2018-01-13 20:52:51 I tried to do a quick google search, the list I’ve seen was in person, but there was a website that’s currently down that seemed to have a list! Aromatherapy/essential oil vendors should have a list on their website or available, that’s where the list I saw came from!

7986 2018-01-13 20:51:24 you keep saying okay, can you come up with fact's Remember that Oil is now 70$ per barrel? and Nigerians petrol #200 per litre

7988 2018-01-13 20:51:13 Boots, baby oil and a smile 
7989 2018-01-13 20:51:12 Walmart is literally the worst place ever for an oil change. These niggas don’t like to work at all.
7990 2018-01-13 20:51:03 Coconut oil has saved my life
7991 2018-01-13 20:50:46 Was trying to reseason a wok, and the oil lit on fire. Got a lid on it pretty quick to extinguish the flames, but had to air out the house, and we all went outside for a bit. We're all safe, and everything's fine, but pretty freaky.

let’s not piss them off.
7993 2018-01-13 20:50:32 Venezuela should look like Dubai. Had oil revenues been invested properly there would be absolutly no poverty there and they would have plenty left over if they wanted to fund things like free education and healthcare.
7994 2018-01-13 20:50:27 Lmao what you was drinking soda or oil?
7995 2018-01-13 20:50:20 Steve at Tresz is always quiet on a big mud point battle and still wants to now when is his alpha and beta analysis going to be stopped being talked about then his current devotee to The goldman way and the goldman silent way to achieve the nomadness of the inherent oil well
7996 2018-01-13 20:50:08 People have to realize when you pull out of the earth the oil and put in the earth chemicals, it will cause the earth problems thus resulting in people bearing the result of those problems.  Who do you think will be hurt first?  The poor.  #Climatechange is real!
7997 2018-01-13 20:50:08 Adulting is when you use birthday money for new windshield wipers and an oil change
7998 2018-01-13 20:49:52 Can't wait to get stuck into these tomorrow. If any team can topple them then it's us at Anfield. You can stick your oil money up your arse.
7999 2018-01-13 20:49:41 That's not how the economy works. Its not apples to oranges. Its 2 provinces who are both largely dependent on oil. The ABNDP wasnt in power prior to the downturn so there was nothing they could do about it. They inherited a terrible economic situation and managed it well.
8000 2018-01-13 20:49:39 I’m out of coconut oil 
8001 2018-01-13 20:49:38 It’s bad @UncleChaps The team assistants refusing to get him tea tree oil for his bellybutton prior to kickoff.
8002 2018-01-13 20:49:37 rhetoric doesn't hold up in court, #yyj City council did this too, but can't say why? evidence is the cornerstone of #justice. #co2 is near its record low, facts trump PR Campaigns. people will have to pay for this ignorance. #bcpoli Big Oil is 10 steps ahead of you! #climate
8003 2018-01-13 20:49:35 Life hack #411 block of kefalotiri but no milk or vodka. Olive oil and Sambuca still damn fine! Happy Saturday! :-)
8004 2018-01-13 20:49:35 This whole getting up early thing and I just aren’t a good mix. Oil and water!
8005 2018-01-13 20:49:24 the guy who changed my oil asked for my number.

I look so busted right now. I got this inflammation thing going on & I was so surprised.

my dumbass: “fr!?”
8006 2018-01-13 20:49:22 You gonna be in pine oil heaven
8007 2018-01-13 20:49:20 Hey guys, if anyone of you need the best olive oil you can imagine, let me know.  I'm sitting here in Sparta right at the source and Dimitri, who is a really nice guy, is looking for distribution partners all over the world. He also sells vegan cheese.
8008 2018-01-13 20:49:02 When you go out to get an oil change and end up buying a new car #ImpulseDecisionToTheMax
8009 2018-01-13 20:48:59 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
8010 2018-01-13 20:48:54 I base my choice of oil on cuisine. If I’m cooking Mediterranean then usually olive oil, if I’m making curry then coconut oil. Flavour always comes first.
8011 2018-01-13 20:48:45 Coconut oil.. wrap a plastic bag or plastic shower cap around it. Longer you leave it in your hair the bettaaa
8012 2018-01-13 20:48:40 Everyone wants the oil but no one wants its production in their backyard. Kind of like a chicken farm. Either we get on board with renewable energy or embrace these offshore rigs in our future.
8013 2018-01-13 20:48:37 We are in serious trouble wallah
8014 2018-01-13 20:48:28 I want to know who these people are who say you can't taste coconut oil when cook/bake with it. #allitasteiscoconut @whole30
8015 2018-01-13 20:47:59 ชอบมากกกกก หล่อออออออ  บรรยายไม่ถูกอ่ะ 555
8016 2018-01-13 20:47:58 I still think salad dressing (ginger-lime?) and/or marinade. If it's not too strong and you have lots, I'd be tempted to try salmon poached in olive oil. I like ginger and salmon together, maybe with a bright citrus slaw alongside--good for winter!
8017 2018-01-13 20:47:54 Shell oil should pull their contract before he ruins their profits.

8023 2018-01-13 20:47:14 I Think @TimSherwooduk  has been drinking some of the illegal Oil that Man City use to buy thier players!  @btsport #nohistory #20000emptyseats #petrolmoney
8024 2018-01-13 20:46:53 How far back in history can we go? Ford and Standard Oil arming Germany in WW2? The Morgan’s merchants of death in WW1? Perhaps the Rothschilds in Napoleanic Wars?
8025 2018-01-13 20:46:44 I feel so creepy when I put coconut oil on my nops. I don’t have any feeling in them, so it’s like I’m lubing up some random person’s nops that live on my chest #casualtransthings
8026 2018-01-13 20:46:42 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8027 2018-01-13 20:46:41 I used Tea Tree Oil Shampoo by Maple Holistics, & it's great! I have psoriasis which breaks out on my scalp & itches like crazy. I had to wait for a breakout before I used it, but only one use & the itching is almost completely gone! I'm so happy, & would highly recommend this!
8028 2018-01-13 20:46:31 Not scientific but as a watcher of Texas real estate I’ve noticed an uptick in distressed ‘hospitality sales’ in the oil fracking areas.  Low interest rates + oil price = even more new units. Many were off 75+% Many non-tourist areas can’t pick up slack later. Texas/selectively.

8030 2018-01-13 20:46:25 After six years, Nate Silver reconnects with the astronaut he believed to be dead and helps rescue him from North Dakota oil boom country.
8031 2018-01-13 20:46:00 You sir are no true pastor. You're obviously a snake oil salesman like Joel Osteen using the bible to fleece your followers and justify the racist policies of the most corrupt man ever to hold the office of the president.
8032 2018-01-13 20:45:47 I'm not sure how I feel about oil paintings because they just look like normal pictures.
8033 2018-01-13 20:45:35 Saudi undercut VZ oil in all of it's markets- crashing it's energy economy at the same time the US hiked food prices (which it imports a lot of) This was planned by US / Saudi to steal Venezuelan oil and privatize it.
8034 2018-01-13 20:45:07 Sis, olive oil, coconut oil, castor oil, glycerine and magnolia oil. Mix them all with a fragrance free aqueous cream.
8035 2018-01-13 20:44:49 الله بالعون 
8036 2018-01-13 20:44:17 Find it really strange when fat people who have oil and grease clogged up in their lungs always the first and have audacity to criticise slim people. Please look to yourself, you’ll probably die out of diabetes and heart attack, but that’s none of my business 
8037 2018-01-13 20:44:02 Drove to sedalia for an oil change and left firestone with people asking when am I going to breed my pup because they want his puppies with his eye color .
8038 2018-01-13 20:44:02 It’s annoying. Especially synthetic oil. I’m over it!
8039 2018-01-13 20:43:59 Good deal!!! That was crazy!!! I'm still twisted abt off shore oil drilling, but not FL!!! REALLY, DUDE??? Dont care to see rigs when visiting MY TX shoreline!!!! GRRRR!!!

8040 2018-01-13 20:43:57 I wonder how the coconut oil tastes when you smoke it
8041 2018-01-13 20:43:44 Tip#1 be sure to have a guaranteed market/delivery... it doesn't store long term... the oil will dry up

8044 2018-01-13 20:43:29 I like oil rigs, I generally liked the article as well. It didn't reveal the magic Macfarquhars Bed(there's even an underwater swim tunnel!) but I'm fairly sure the Black Isle name doesn't come from the soil...though there is debate on it, I don't think it's that.
8045 2018-01-13 20:43:29 Hopefully Zinke doesn’t sell it off to oil companies like in Utah.

8053 2018-01-13 20:42:29 For the absurd price I'm paying for parking, the space should come with a guy who will rotate my tires and change the oil. And I want him to be a Russian dude named Ivan so he can also hack shit for me.
8054 2018-01-13 20:42:29 Why did they change Marathons to Snickers; Jif to Cif; Oil of Ulay to Oil of Olay and Opal Fruits to Starburst. They shit really rips ma knittin ffs.
8055 2018-01-13 20:42:22 You know you’re ill when you can no longer smell olbas oil 
8056 2018-01-13 20:42:10 I just mentioned them all not knowing what flavors appease your palate. One good pairing is a Tuscan herb oil (A delicious blend of herbs, sun-dried tomatoes & garlic infused olive oil) & a Cranberry Pear White Balsamic (Clean, crisp, very tart & amazingly fruity). Uniquely good!
8057 2018-01-13 20:42:07 Tax increases, globull warming, wide open borders and more regulations.   Oh, close down coal again and move towards ending oil.  That's a winning ticket right there.
8058 2018-01-13 20:42:03 Sud olive oil.
8059 2018-01-13 20:41:58 Este boludo no ve que estoy sopleteando con gas oil. Se me acerca fumando. Es un vejiga completo
8060 2018-01-13 20:41:52 Thanks for reminding us again how you assisted in giving global corporate oil interests our public lands to savage in addition to giving them massive tax cuts and leaving us, the tax payer with both the clean up bill and the tax give away bill. Who do you work for again?
8061 2018-01-13 20:41:50 Prices for oil changes. 
8062 2018-01-13 20:41:46 FUCK I NEED A OIL CHANGE
8063 2018-01-13 20:41:46 How about going after monopolies like Walmart and Amazon and banks too big to fail and Google and Microsoft and Apple...?  It's about time Congress does that the way Congress went after Standard Oil in the 20th century?  These monopolies pay you too much not to, right?
8064 2018-01-13 20:41:45 Missouri Western fans. Attending today’s @MWSUMBB game? Stop by our booth to sign up to win a free detail and fee oil change!
8065 2018-01-13 20:41:38 With the richest oil reserves in the world. Let that sink in.
8066 2018-01-13 20:41:34 Idk man I think it is the fat on the meat that goes wild not the oil. Only had a tiny bit of canola oil on there and it wasn't smoking much at all before I threw the meat on there. Maybe just too hot?
8067 2018-01-13 20:41:30 No wait for an oil change @MisterCarWash #yesplease
8068 2018-01-13 20:41:19 Panthers have won five in a firestone while getting my oil changed how strange has your day been.
8069 2018-01-13 20:41:11 Being an adult and getting my oil changed like I'd planned, even tho I don't rly want to after the last couple hours. T.T
8070 2018-01-13 20:41:07 Maybe mayor @BilldeBlasio should spend tax payer money on teachers pay instead of suing the oil industry for the hoax of global warming?
8071 2018-01-13 20:41:03 Which one is better for hair? Black castor oil or coconut oil
8072 2018-01-13 20:40:47 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
8073 2018-01-13 20:40:47 Just not a great team. Plenty of talent but blend together like oil and water. UM well coached as usual. The frustration of fan base emerges from the hype this particular MSU team got preseason.
8074 2018-01-13 20:40:47 Can UK construction emulate the oil & automotive industries & transform its productivity? @cesouthwest @CPF_SW
8075 2018-01-13 20:40:45 One of their solutions to pay some of the people’s salaries after its cuted by federal gov.
I know that all the parties included arab parties know about oil dealing specially until now the main parties get percents 5-10% of the oil for their benefits, this is Bremer’s decision
8076 2018-01-13 20:40:28 Anyways have a blissful night rest.
8077 2018-01-13 20:40:16 Oil!
8078 2018-01-13 20:40:13 @Walmart never using Walmart Auto ever again. 1 Hour and 51 minutes and car just left the garage for a simple oil change. 5 mechanics at work and in that time only 4 cars got serviced. St. Robert, Missouri Walmart Auto is complete garbage.
8079 2018-01-13 20:40:09 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
8080 2018-01-13 20:40:02 Nothing hurts on this app. I just can't relate, you don't even know what you're saying.
8081 2018-01-13 20:39:46 Fully agree Tony. I don’t add acidifiers either. AMS and Oil instead.
8082 2018-01-13 20:39:24 Agreed on the whole diet aspect.

In terms of cooking (as in heating it up), what is your oil of choice?
8083 2018-01-13 20:39:23 Came for an oil service and guess who also needs a transmission service 
8084 2018-01-13 20:39:15 Someone even said...with the amount of oil in Morata's hair, that he can join OPEC
8085 2018-01-13 20:39:12 Interesting! I've never used it. What's the base oil? Like, is it a flavored olive oil or something else? I would suggest either stir fry or the base for a salad dressing (say with rice vinegar)?
8086 2018-01-13 20:38:56 ONGC should stop employing Illiterate Chaddies like Someshit Patra, who knows nothing about oil, or natural gas, but is an expert on Gobar Gas.
8087 2018-01-13 20:38:47 @FionaDecleorUK Hi Fiona, also meant to ask, using svelt body cream and mixing with svelt body oil, is this okay or should I layer one before the other?
8088 2018-01-13 20:38:44 I'm more concerned over politicians accepting benefits from an oil industry mogul than a religious philanthropist. Nor was Ambrose cleared - rather there is a gap in the rules concerning benefits received by opposition members.
8089 2018-01-13 20:38:43 I’m here at Subaru getting an oil change and there’s nothing but hipsters and old people and I’m just the odd one out 
8090 2018-01-13 20:38:40 @Shell_US  How does Shell Oil allow an affiliated gas station at 108 W. San Ysidro Boulevard San Diego Ca 92173 to shut off gas pumps & not serve our Great CBP Agents??? This is counter to Patriotism & good business practice!! @FoxNews
8091 2018-01-13 20:38:36 Lol so its this hurtful,I really enjoyed this,now you know how ppl u blackmail feel

8095 2018-01-13 20:37:43 We may not be in first place but I LOVE this team. The spirit, the great relationships with each other and the way they love this club. I would take this over an oil money team that is sterile and plays for the money only.
8096 2018-01-13 20:37:41 I have a poké recipe for you. Just toss equal parts sweet soy sauce and kukui nut oil with some chopped up limu and scallions with a touch of chili flakes.
8097 2018-01-13 20:37:40 Nigeria is a baby nation very wealthy with oil they use Petrodollar as currency exchange, very wealthy. Why don't they invite their neighbors over for a shot at citizenship. Very wealthy.
8098 2018-01-13 20:37:25 50cals doesn't have the punch the 20mm did, so would still feel Spitfire packed a bigger punch. Would have liked to have seen something akin to the Rheinmetall-Borsig Mk 108 30mm Autocannon fitted to either though. 

Also, Griffon engine was all brute power ( and oil.... )
8099 2018-01-13 20:36:57 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
8100 2018-01-13 20:36:52 Trump and empathy wow like oil and water
8101 2018-01-13 20:36:47 Oh, now I know you don't have sense. I shouldn't have taken you serious at first. Good night Mr foreigner.
8102 2018-01-13 20:36:33 Lol you think if he isn't the president the price of oil will go up?
8103 2018-01-13 20:36:32 Oil change on my ride full tank and cleaned 
8104 2018-01-13 20:36:27 I want to eat pitza  of  Mutzarella and another one of Chicken and chesse with many olives and olive oil
8105 2018-01-13 20:35:55 The Norwegians  have the highest standard of living for the same reason the Saudi Family has gold plated toilet fixtures, and Russia is other than a third world country: because it has vast oil reserves and a very small population with low reproduction rates. Oil pays for it.
8106 2018-01-13 20:35:45 That oil is some crack. Made a lil concoction of my own from it.
8107 2018-01-13 20:35:34 I bought pure tea tree essential oil from amazon and use it ONLY on the pimples. They will heal very fast. If you pick it will get worse & spread.  I never had acne than at 24 got cystic and nothing but tea tree worked on deep acne.
8108 2018-01-13 20:35:09 Good luck to you on your 2018 healthy new you initiative. You can add some amazing and healthy flavors to your salads and proteins with flavored olive oils and balsamic vinegars. Check your local oil and vin specialty stores or @LeaningLadder has over 50+ flavors and combo recmnd
8109 2018-01-13 20:35:03 He fucked off because he can see the pitiful state of your club. You've lost your identity & become another corporate whore. It's embarrassing. No different from the idiots in Madrid. More than a club? Haha. Not any more. Now whores of the oil men; except u r skint. Hilarious.
8110 2018-01-13 20:34:54 I get home from said grocery store, unload my car, and as I’m walking in a bag breaks and a $12 bottle of avocado oil busts on my foot. 

More upset that I lost the oil than I am about hurting my foot.

8112 2018-01-13 20:34:33 Today I said the sentence: “Could you please hold my flat white whilst I buy some olive oil.”

WHAT is Bath DOING to me
8113 2018-01-13 20:34:33 i’ve heard avocado oil helps i have a natural version of scar cream that has it
8114 2018-01-13 20:34:31 It’s oil based but doesn’t feel heavy you know? It’s light weight
8115 2018-01-13 20:34:31 Just not off maralago coast.....only eyesore and oilspills for liberals where it won't ruin his vacay during an oil spill.
8116 2018-01-13 20:34:22 Now since they are all filthy rich they're trying to jack up the price of oil and create an artificial scarcity because they can control us easier by using Electric vehicles powered with solar panels and wind turbines which are super expensive also.
8117 2018-01-13 20:33:54 All of it. Bears are very fatty and they burned bear grease with a wick for light before the whaling industry switched the world to whale oil then Mr. Edison came along with his little machines and poof there goes the whalers. Check it out on SSE, the story is there
8118 2018-01-13 20:33:48 Good luck boys. Cheering for you from home.

8121 2018-01-13 20:33:37 Yes, autonomy and inter-connectedness will create decent efficiencies in space and emissions, but in Australia, for now, the dirty secret is "electric cars" means cars powered by coal instead of oil.
8122 2018-01-13 20:33:28 No Ibrahim. I don't give a fiddlers fuck about her religion. I only care that she is selling snake oil and a fraud. You can try and make this about religion but it won't happen.
8123 2018-01-13 20:33:27 1-0 after 1. Shots are 10-3 in favour of the Hounds.
8124 2018-01-13 20:33:27 Done my oil treatment on my hair this morning and it is really giving me lifeeeeeee 
8125 2018-01-13 20:33:00 The day my car can take itself for an oil change, I will be happy
8126 2018-01-13 20:32:56 As in oil?
8127 2018-01-13 20:32:55 My dude it’s been 2 hours. I just came for an oil change 
8128 2018-01-13 20:32:53 That's a false choice. Let's rapidly transition from oil sands to renewables and we can have equitable  and clean green jobs. It's not a choice between Saudi Arabia and Canada. It's a choice between past and future energy. We do it or someone else will.
8129 2018-01-13 20:32:40 My favorite oil will always be frankincense because if lifts me to higher ground- the scent is truly HEAVENly.
8130 2018-01-13 20:32:31 If you think that, you should put down the hamburger. And use different oil to cook the fries. You do know that the bun has wheat in it as well? But go with what your intellectuals tell you.
8131 2018-01-13 20:32:22 Gold Backed Yuan launches next week without the gold or the deliverable oil
But it will be a GAME CHANGER!
8132 2018-01-13 20:31:58 My favourite oil is without a doubt Sacred Mountain, (followed closely by Three Wise Men). I live in a bustling city & tree oils are so important for me.
8133 2018-01-13 20:31:56 I’ve had the same experience.
One of my close friends was a lifelong southern Democrat, but he just switched to independent.
He’s in the “I didn’t leave the party, the party left me” camp.
8134 2018-01-13 20:31:48 If it ever spills, it will be called the Murkowski oil spill in honor of you
8135 2018-01-13 20:31:45 Yeah ok the info is as official as both sterling's and youngs diving... back on point, if Sanchez wanted money he would sit tight till end of season and bag 30 mill plus 250k a week from the oil rich sugar daddies 
8136 2018-01-13 20:31:43 Dealership randomly slid me a gift certificate which brought my oil change to $3  ain't God good
8137 2018-01-13 20:31:39 It’s argan oil based so yes. I let it sit in while doing my hair or rub it in well and it doesn’t feel oily
8138 2018-01-13 20:31:39 @305Crash this @VelvetNoirBC An coconut oil
8139 2018-01-13 20:31:31 People who are angry from selling #KRG its oil for some countries; can I ask if you have any other solution to pay the #KRI people’s salaries after the #Iraq Federal gov. stop send the salaries & ban the borders and airports?
8140 2018-01-13 20:31:29 Then when will you set an example and not use any oil? The only way anyone will believe you are serious is if you lead by example.
8141 2018-01-13 20:31:27 Did us all here in the UK a giant favour by staying away, be worse than a huge oil slick hitting our shores
8142 2018-01-13 20:31:03 i swear to god my car place is fucking with my car. got 2 new tires. one came off the rim while i was driving. they rotated my tires so i don't know which one is the bad one. suddenly i'm out of oil. BITCH WTF
8143 2018-01-13 20:31:02 Shut up Travis u smell like motor oil
8144 2018-01-13 20:31:01 Luv sitting for an hour and a half waiting for an oil change
8145 2018-01-13 20:30:44 While y’all kicking us out. Remember to get out of our continent and leave the diamonds. Gold. Oil. Coltan. Uranium. Iron ore. Petrolium. . Cocoa beans. Spirituality. Maths. Science. Astrology. Humankind in general (Eve). And culture that you (still) vulture. Where you found it

8147 2018-01-13 20:30:29 oh you have a crystal ball forcasting market prices? please let me know why you are on twitter and not rubbing elbows with the saudi oil princes on your private naval fleet
8148 2018-01-13 20:30:19 We're an oil tanker 
This'll take some turning around. 
#mffc
8149 2018-01-13 20:30:19 I wish my skin would chill the fuck down bc since late november it’s been rlly dry but today I just woke up and it’s so fucking oily it’s like I used literal vegetal oil on my face
8150 2018-01-13 20:30:11 One thing has been cleared up. Buttons do exist.
8151 2018-01-13 20:30:08 Eh I've got to make sage and rose oil first. Or maybe I can just use rosewater? hmmm
8152 2018-01-13 20:30:04 While some decent people may have fallen victim to his snake oil during the campaign, if you still support him after all he's shown of himself & his views you are racist, sexist, xenophobic, hateful, scared, untrustworthy & likely self-loathing. Trump only benefits Trump.
8153 2018-01-13 20:30:03 @pieminister has your Moo pie always contained coconut oil? My fiancé is allergic but I’m sure he’s eaten this pie in the past - just seen it in ingredients and not sure if I can serve it to him! #allergies
8154 2018-01-13 20:29:58 Beds are burning - midnight oil
8155 2018-01-13 20:29:51 okay so who wants to take my car to get the oil changed so I can go back to sleep for work 
8156 2018-01-13 20:29:36 Those global warming nut jobs think 7 billion people can just cut fossil fuels cold turkey. They can’t. The current renewable technology is not sustainable for the entire world to use. Ex. electric batteries 4 cars need cobalt and other metals, which are mined just like oil
8157 2018-01-13 20:29:34 Gotta go Oil/ Connor..from one Grimshaw guy to another
8158 2018-01-13 20:29:15 この場合塗り始め、が適切かもしれませんなｗ
8159 2018-01-13 20:28:58 I define the word "evil" as "not aligned with God's / Creator's purpose". Oil sands tailings reclamation as reported Pembina Institution after 50 years is 0.1%.
8160 2018-01-13 20:28:43 Am I the only one that uses olive oil in my salads instead of dressing? I hate dressing lol
8161 2018-01-13 20:28:40 I was just about to say, I’ve never had the olive oil kind. But the reg fire!
8162 2018-01-13 20:28:23 @Walmart 1 Hr and 41 minutes for an oil change. Car still in shop. Waiting waiting waiting
8163 2018-01-13 20:28:14 guy at the wild bird store basically offered me a job and, for a minute, i could see myself lugging 20kg sacks of black oil sunflower seeds for fifteen bucks an hour. and it kinda looked good.
8164 2018-01-13 20:28:07 I have 10 more lbs to lose before I eat. Dreaming of kidney bean/egg white/bacon/cheese/taco seasoning/olive oil salad
8165 2018-01-13 20:28:06 now that my big vat of coconut oil is here it's over for y'all
8166 2018-01-13 20:27:56 Thanks... you have been to a game in a Vegas?..Lucky. I wanted to catch the oil game there tonight but it just wouldn't work. I can imagine it would be nuts..but it seems to help them...#scaryathome
8167 2018-01-13 20:27:55 Note to self if the inner voice is saying change the oil and rotate the tires do it.
8168 2018-01-13 20:27:52 You may be mired in a university but I'm pretty sure the last time I looked the nationalised oil company in #Venezuela  called #PDVSA was one of the key reasons the country was about to collapse. Nice try on deflecting the blame elsewhere, I won't be responding further.
8169 2018-01-13 20:27:41 So are you awake? I jus woke up too. To oil the youngest
8170 2018-01-13 20:27:36 Now someone with sense is saying something.
8171 2018-01-13 20:27:04 When will you stop using oil?
8172 2018-01-13 20:26:59 para debatir se necesita honor y ni maduro ni falcon lo tienen por lo tanto debate esteril.
8173 2018-01-13 20:26:47 There are some oil companies who are in on this deindustrialization agenda who want to make oil so rare and so expensive that only the super rich can afford it.
8174 2018-01-13 20:26:33 shea butter & vitamin e oil weather
8175 2018-01-13 20:26:10 So you admit you have enough oil for yourself. Why do you not think anyone else deserves an?
8176 2018-01-13 20:26:06 Water & Oil
8177 2018-01-13 20:25:48 Follow the money! Sounds like oil!
8178 2018-01-13 20:25:46 trump is determined to destroy the land for the sake of enriching his buddies in oil and gas--he cares nothing for America--we are just an opportunity for him to Rape the US Treasury and squander the land for his own greedy purposes.
8179 2018-01-13 20:25:36  Oil companies before Homelessness. Hmmmmm.

8182 2018-01-13 20:24:54 Wal Mart has me fucked up waiting for 3 damn hours just for an oil change 
8183 2018-01-13 20:24:51 Bio oil
8184 2018-01-13 20:24:51 Far better. Stir fried veg and noodles in a soy, honey, sriracha & sesame oil sauce. Chopped roasted peanuts for a treat. It’s a superb and V V quick meal 
8185 2018-01-13 20:24:18 Hi, former vet tech here! Lavender oil is not toxic to cats unless in MASSIVE amounts, and is in fact sometimes applied in conjunction with holistic physical therapy techniques to speed recovery in injured cats.
8186 2018-01-13 20:24:07 Everyone knows me where i get my oil changed & i dont remember any of their faces 
8187 2018-01-13 20:24:05 The way Real Madrid is going down eeer, they will soon discover crude oil  let me come and b going 
8188 2018-01-13 20:24:05 always surprised by how much my hair shines after having oiled and washed it shout out the coconut oil godssss
8189 2018-01-13 20:24:00 Parboiled for 4 mins first, blanched in 120 degree oil for 2 mins, 8-10 mins at 160 degrees. UTTER CRISPY JOY. My 12 yo got a deep fat fryer for her birthday.
8190 2018-01-13 20:23:56 I use a wok to cook most stuff as it needs less oil & keeps the heat longer you might be pleasantly surprised with how much you use it 
8191 2018-01-13 20:23:53 Oil barrel prices have gone from $40 to #60 since Trump and no-one seems to care. Consumer price index hit record highs in December partly due to high energy costs. How y'all gonna spend YOUR tax cuts?
8192 2018-01-13 20:23:53 Pretty sure they don't consider him President.
Just an illegitimate interloper to mock and jeer.
8193 2018-01-13 20:23:51 California produces some of the dirtiest oil in the world.
8194 2018-01-13 20:23:42 Hold very tight please, ding, ding. O Flanders, O Swan, where are you now?!
8195 2018-01-13 20:23:41 I love watching Tristan Jarry. Remember watching him play for the Oil Kings and winning the memorial cup. Was always my favourite. It always makes me happy to see him doing so well in Pittsburgh
8196 2018-01-13 20:23:20 Pop 5 million.  Economy completely dependent on oil and gas.
8197 2018-01-13 20:23:19 Someone just tell me if tea tree oil really is the shit or if I’m wasting my time please!!!
8198 2018-01-13 20:23:13 Did you know that you can reuse our small essential oil bottles? I love to use them as cane toppers in the garden!
8199 2018-01-13 20:22:47 After three days of UNREPS in the middle of a snowstorm at sea, an Oil Slick and a good Italian coffee was the first thing I wanted when we pulled into port.
8200 2018-01-13 20:22:39 The Riverwalk section that was closed due an oil spill earlier in the week is now open. Mike D.
8201 2018-01-13 20:22:26 Traders! I just read something about crack spreads on WallStreetOasis. Anyone look at Heating Oil and Gasoline for trading Crude Oil? @Simple_Trends @Bamabroker @chigrl @AdamMancini4 @WarrenPuffett9 @ThePivotKing
8202 2018-01-13 20:22:24 Kids say and do the darnedest things. Kids are amazing. That's why the Baltimore public school issue and everything like it is so depressing. All kids deserve a future. Trump brought up Norway a socialist country that puts its oil revenues into the country.
8203 2018-01-13 20:22:24 And I’m awake again. As Lil I is running a temp so have to wake up and oil him 
#woesofamum
8204 2018-01-13 20:22:21 But not the daily drivers burning the oil, it’s not their fault at all.
8205 2018-01-13 20:22:21 Thanks Rezwana for booking a Oil And Filter Change with #Fiix for your Mazda!  #Ajax #Toronto #Tech
8206 2018-01-13 20:22:18 Am I the only one who puts coconut oil on after I get out the shower and then waits 10 minutes before I put my clothes on cause I’m scared it’s gon stain my clothes?or am I just dramatic?
8207 2018-01-13 20:21:59 Please tell Exxon mobile to stop their oil exploits in a SHITHOLE Country like Ghana.
8208 2018-01-13 20:21:39 You have enough oil for yourself so nobody else deserves any. 

Oil wells in California emit more than anything in Alberta. Why don't you work to shut those down?
8209 2018-01-13 20:21:32 Americans getting salty cause of a false alarm
maybe dont fuck over half the world for oil or spreading ideologies and no one would want to bomb you
8210 2018-01-13 20:21:26 Those subsidies have been the equivalent of a carbon price, a renewables-only antidote to no carbon price. The solution is carbon price applied to all generation sources-- benefiting both renewables & nuclear, not coal, gas oil--or zero carbon credits for renewables and nuclear.

8220 2018-01-13 20:19:43 The right thing between now & when @MBuhari decides is for him to minimize anything that will give waillers the chance to spill over palm oil on his white garment, bcos they've been instructed to look & capitalise on such loopholes. @GarShehu @FemAdesina
8221 2018-01-13 20:19:41 You heard right! Creamy, all natural, extra virgin olive oil naturally infused with the rich flavor of butter. Golden, vegetarian, dairy-free olive oil to substitute in baking or anywhere you might use melted butter. @LeaningLadder sells Butter Olive Oil in 3 different sizes.
8222 2018-01-13 20:19:31 Banana Oil, get your Goolie snacks ready for tonight Godzilla Flick!

8228 2018-01-13 20:18:35 I am so so excited for the Change of Use for my land in Almeria . I would like to plant Picual Olive trees and produce Organic Olive Oil . Also this will be in effort to do Olive farming using permaculture techniques . Harvest rain water . Preserve ground water .
8229 2018-01-13 20:18:32 @DavidMundellDCT is a charlatan and a fraud
no more than an old school snake oil salesman 
There I've said it
8230 2018-01-13 20:18:30 coconut oil had literally healed my lips completely and i used carmax still sitting in my purse twice yesterday while at work because it was so dry and woke up with inflamed lips all over again. so today i scraped it all out of the container and put coconut oil in instead
8231 2018-01-13 20:18:21 well let's face it,------ it's all about the   " OIL " !  (  MAKE WESTERN CANADA a REPUBLIC )    =  payment    BC --- ALTA ---- SASK ---- MAN ---- $ 3 BILLION DOLLARS,      instead of 11.9 BILLION DOLLARS to WELFARE prov. Quebec
8232 2018-01-13 20:18:18 my hair always fucking dry. the one time I put some damn oil in it, I put too much in and now I gotta wash it and do it all over again. I hate me

8236 2018-01-13 20:17:50 Will this update fix not being able to place structures on certain parts of map? Can't place oil pumps on oil veins, etc
8237 2018-01-13 20:17:43 I think that's as good an explanation as any of that amoeba known as "peak oil," Jigar. "Peak demand" was a reaction to "peak supply" but despite many popular misconceptions  there was more to it than just conventional supply peaking.
8238 2018-01-13 20:17:31 Oh my car take synethic oil btw im mad as hell

Melania is nude laying on a polar bear skin carpet, masturbating while reading the latest articles on climate change. Donald enters wearing nothing but a kimono, holding a bottle of crude oil and a pink iPod shuffle

Donald: Honey, I'm ready to do shithole
8242 2018-01-13 20:16:41 not oil. You can do garlic if you like.
8243 2018-01-13 20:16:22 Should I be putting on moisturiser after I put oil on at night? Also @CarolineHirons what is an amazing moisturiser for dry/combination skin? Nothing I use really feels like it’s adding moisture to my skin 
8244 2018-01-13 20:16:22 it’s OIL! not OYEL!!!!!! @thealienpotato
8245 2018-01-13 20:16:20 I think part of what makes the motion sickness worse is the fact that Gordon controls like he is running on an oil slick. Unless of course you hold down the shift key. Then he just moves like a snail.
8246 2018-01-13 20:16:18 If you've never seen someone being forced to drink "fish oil" then i understand your shock towards what happened to the H&M stores.

8250 2018-01-13 20:15:45 In NZ, our Cadbury choc was once amazing, then they moved the factory to Australia a few years back, & the flavour changed, used palm oil (also supplying the Asian market, v sweet taste). Now the best NZ choc is Whittakers, hands down.
8251 2018-01-13 20:15:40 So there aren't 30,000,000+ white supremacists (or enablers)? It's not racist? It's not homophobic? It hasn't committed genocide? It doesn't have an oil hungry war economy? It doesn't lie? The 1% don't have one system for themselves & natural seletion for everyone else? A joke.

8255 2018-01-13 20:15:24 Friend- "Dude, why do you have so much coconut oil?" 

Me- "It's a good moisturizer, I like to use it when I masturbate." 

Friend- "..."

Me- "I also like to use it when I cook." 

Friend- "You coulda just said that one from the jump."
8256 2018-01-13 20:15:23 I think your numbers are off. Jamaica Haiti Brazil all have higher murder. When you have deteriorating infrastructure, not to mention foreign intervention, and whoever granted permits for all those oil rigs around the shoreline. Can’t you see it was USA that is keeping us down?
8257 2018-01-13 20:15:23 Is it just me who's affected by coconut oil? My skin yo

8259 2018-01-13 20:14:49 I’d say 90 percent of cardiologists or more would say go with olive oil.
8260 2018-01-13 20:14:47 Things I have done today:
-gotten my oil changed (and a few other things attended to)
-got my rent fully paid, and some money moved around my accounts
-got my flat tire fixed
-bought two new pairs of shoes for the first time in a year-plus
-closed my old bank account

8270 2018-01-13 20:12:17 Got a free oil change today. #daymade
8271 2018-01-13 20:12:12 Actually, first, you gotta come down here closer to me in the Ozarks for the oil like Jed was when he went shootin for some food. Bring your own gun tho cuz I’m the only Arkansas hillbilly who doesn’t own one. 
8272 2018-01-13 20:12:10 Norway is the worlds fifth largest oil exporter, the third largest gas exporter with a population of just over 5 million. They are bound to be quite well off. Your comparison with the USA is utterly rediculous.
8273 2018-01-13 20:12:10 Coconut errrthing. Coconut oil. Coconut milk coconut water. Coconut flakes coconut cereal coconut body spray. Coconut shampoo & conditioner coconut soap. Coconut (shade) makeup. No games played.
8274 2018-01-13 20:11:54 try peppermint oil on your temples if you can :-))
8275 2018-01-13 20:11:35 The only as : After allowing oil price…
8276 2018-01-13 20:11:35 I've discovered coconut oil for frying stuff, but I didn't know I could eat it! Never really been into cauliflower. Except cauliflower cheese. Omg now I want cauliflower cheese!
8277 2018-01-13 20:11:23 Dude I can't wait for summer..I could cry thinking about just laying in my yard eating fruit with coconut oil in my hair 
8278 2018-01-13 20:11:10 Retweeted kenna (@kennagq):

With the amount of oil in Morata's hair , he can join OPEC
8279 2018-01-13 20:10:54 debt forgiveness for the unemployed would NOT involve bankruptcy since it was market induced...regions like Alberta when oil plummeted for instance
8280 2018-01-13 20:10:45 I'm just saying if my own uncle kept me  he didn't  give me my oil checks are some type of money to at least help me out my sister kept me here and there she didn't give me My oil checks why didn't she offer me some money to help me out why did people keep me? What is they hiding

8286 2018-01-13 20:10:07 Take the Castor Oil that you’ve earned.
8287 2018-01-13 20:09:55 and yet, you accused scientists of trying to destroy America by trying to get us off oil. 
make up your mind; you can't just keep throwing out new conspiracies that contradict the conspiracies you've already spouted.

8289 2018-01-13 20:09:50 I bought lovely olive oil bottles with decent pourers and want to make my own flavoured oils. But will get confused with basil, tarragon, sage etc.
8290 2018-01-13 20:09:42 i hate sitting in line at this particular oil change place...i swear i be waiting for like 45 to a hour 1 
8291 2018-01-13 20:09:14 Beds are burning de Midnight Oil
8292 2018-01-13 20:09:02 .@realDonaldTrump  .@POTUS You disgustingly call other countries "shithole" while turning the US into one: gutting clean air/water/energy policies, approving pipelines & off-shore drilling so the possibility of more oil spills, promoting more fracking on public lands and more!
8293 2018-01-13 20:08:57 You need to take a trip to California, Norway or Germany for a field trip to see how far we are lagging behind. Oil and gas was last century
8294 2018-01-13 20:08:56 Very easy way to fix that problem! Stop sending gas and any oil related products to New York and surrounding areas that'll fix their ass. Including natural gas let them freeze.
8295 2018-01-13 20:08:49 Looks like a great place for oil drilling!!
8296 2018-01-13 20:08:42 So he beat a Conference full of oil change techs for 7 years and won 3 coin flip series vs a team that played about double the playoff games to get there?
8297 2018-01-13 20:08:38 Coconut oil on everything 
8298 2018-01-13 20:08:22 Both incidence are rightly terrible and should be extremely condemned?
The perpetrators for both should be harshly dealt with by the government. Human lives should never ever become a politicized matter.
8299 2018-01-13 20:08:20 ugh i really need to go get my oil changed but i’ve wrapped myself into the perfect blanket burrito and don’t want to do anything to ruin it
8300 2018-01-13 20:08:15 We don’t want it in California either.   I lived in Santa Barbara when the oil spill happened.  It was horrible for years!
8301 2018-01-13 20:08:01 Fish oil with their food. Aloe Vera on their skin.
8302 2018-01-13 20:07:49 Garage has a heavy gas and oil smell to it and fix messy fur <.<
8303 2018-01-13 20:07:41 Olive Oil
8304 2018-01-13 20:07:39 That's where the trouble begins. The US is already facing down Russia over Ukraine (pipeline routes, 1/4 of the world's natural gas), Syria (oil), etc. The resource grab is on and winner takes all.
8305 2018-01-13 20:07:23 Don't laugh it off. Who do you think is ISIS selling oil to? They've not destroyed cities by throwing sand balls.
8306 2018-01-13 20:07:21 us bank sucks dick, u should switch to a bank/credit union that doesnt invest in big oil and also has reasonable hours 
8307 2018-01-13 20:07:20 Be jealous of Texas and it’s position on the national/international stage: “wind power, nuclear waste respository in New Mexico, oil and gas innovation, extreme weather, the “wall” with Mexico, Congressional retirements” #SciCommSouth2018
8308 2018-01-13 20:07:19 Doing this kind of work 4 your economy is GREAT, raping the waters off your shores with oil drilling is a disgrace. U R a threat 2 humanity!

8319 2018-01-13 20:05:41 such vowel oil fill element d6f7
8320 2018-01-13 20:05:20 So your constituents are okay with opening drilling in a wildlife refuge? Native Alaskans know what that will do for hunting and animal migration. No food, more poverty...great job Murkowski! You made oil companies proud!
8321 2018-01-13 20:05:03 Heeke is leaking oil trying to get to the finish line.
8322 2018-01-13 20:04:44 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases.Thanks - Lee 2/2
8323 2018-01-13 20:04:19 And you Faisal, when we’re you last in Ghana? I spent 2 years there working in the oil fields. Minute pockets of wealth, the rest, well I’ll let POTUS speak for me!
8324 2018-01-13 20:04:19 Things I want as much as Theo Walcott wants a move to Everton:
Prostate exam by Dr Scissor hands.

Genital warts. 
Nude oil painting of the mother-in-law.
8325 2018-01-13 20:04:17 Does Dairy Milk contain palm oil or not? If so, has it always contained palm oil? If not, how can you say the recipe has not changed?
8326 2018-01-13 20:04:15 He was  The Best Snake Oil Salesman the Government could get to deliver the Brexit dream - its hard to make dreams reality

8337 2018-01-13 20:02:48 Based on data, you do realize a bad oil spill is highly likely?
8338 2018-01-13 20:02:47 Superfund clean up?Didn’t Pruitt just kill the .09 per gallon tax so Filthy oil corps can dump the costs of shoddy maintenance&unsafe technology on tax payers?
8339 2018-01-13 20:02:42 I went to PHC for my God daughter last year and came back to Lagos with so much sauce in my pores. Lmfao I reeked of red oil from eating way too much bole sauce and fish.

8344 2018-01-13 20:02:19 I’m talking about demand. It’s still going up. (As an aside, I don’t recall such subtleties in the definition when the peak oil supply narrative was being hyped a decade ago)
8345 2018-01-13 20:02:16 Need to offer Sanchez and his agent what ever they want otherwise Chelsea psg and the oil merchants will be in for him

8354 2018-01-13 20:01:31 I don’t have the packaging that has the brand name on it but it was a store on Camden market. I used castor oil before and I’ve found before using this Vitamin E oil worked really good. When I next go back I’ll give you specifics 
8355 2018-01-13 20:01:18 @HowdyHonda were an oil change takes an hour & a half while they inspect your car for problems even though you didn’t ask them to

8364 2018-01-13 20:00:05 I got it from a store on Camden Market and it’s just in a plain bottle and I don’t have the bag with the label however the ingredients are just jasmine, ylang ylang, cherry blossom and vitamin E oil. I’ll let you know when I next go back with specifics 
8365 2018-01-13 19:59:59 Oil, money and power

8368 2018-01-13 19:59:32 I needed an oil change so bad! My car sounded like it was on train tracks 
8369 2018-01-13 19:59:31 China has boosted African oil and mining sectors in exchange for advantageous trade deals. Chinese companies are also diversifying their business pursuits in Africa, in infrastructure, manufacturing, telecommunications, and agricultural sectors.

8373 2018-01-13 19:59:10 oil painting videos are so fucking fun to watch
8374 2018-01-13 19:59:09 Another thing I do for my face: Honey mask 8 minutes (@ bath time) followed w apple cider vinegar & water mix & lastly coconut oil. I had a facial where they get in your face w magnifying glass & she was floored by my pores. I never breakout & I used to have combo skin.
8375 2018-01-13 19:59:03 I remember I didnt get an oil change for almost 2 years when i had the Nissan Altima and the engine blew

8380 2018-01-13 19:58:22 Dude my Great Grandma just sprayed cannabis oil in her mouth at ARBY'S 
8381 2018-01-13 19:58:15 but you'd still have to mix the mix with eggs and oil probably.  Because, despite my insane wealth and comfort, the world still demands too much effort. :)
8382 2018-01-13 19:57:58 Pretty much what Laura said. This was a small study, and the overall picture still shows olive oil has amazing benefits and saturated fat (including coconut oil) shouldn’t be too high. A whole diet approach is more important!

8384 2018-01-13 19:57:41 The oil companies should help NYC by not selling any petrol products in the five boroughs starting now.
8385 2018-01-13 19:57:36 im fucking rich ,made 6$ of oil today and also made 8$ of some steam shit 
8386 2018-01-13 19:57:24 Yeah it’s my first time with an actual oil but it’s doing bits so far
8387 2018-01-13 19:57:23 I found a tea tree oil that works wonders on the pimps!!
8388 2018-01-13 19:57:18 and in all fairness the UK and oil revenue should not be in the same sentence, unless of course oil is coming out of the thousands of square miles of OUR waters Blair and Dewar, appropriated for the south , on the eve of the opening of Scot parl, you ppl disgust me
8389 2018-01-13 19:57:10 Good for you. I am getting the car washed, changing the oil, muttering to myself, basically going bananas right now.
8390 2018-01-13 19:57:09 I think the revenue from Saudi outweighs what they cost to the benefit system, dont know what will happen when the Oil dries up mind.
8391 2018-01-13 19:57:06 yes, you can use it if you have oily skin. A good quality face oil will rinse off without stripping the skin of its moisture barrier.
8392 2018-01-13 19:56:54 @MSNBC Trump is sure not helping my economy, gas here in Oklahoma is showing $2.50 a gallon, up over a dollar in one year!!  Not appreciated at all Trump, keep saying how good everything is, IT"S NOT!! Trump dances in Saudi Arabia while they are screwing us on oil price!!
8393 2018-01-13 19:56:53 We’re likely gonna have about a 10% shot... so dare to dream - goes to show how lucky TO was to get Matthews... to say nothing of the Oil - speaking of... they better not win

8396 2018-01-13 19:55:54 I’ve been vaping gruyere oil all day.
8397 2018-01-13 19:55:47 So you prefer a dictator? Maybe thats what some people require. Libya was fortunate to earn it's wealth off oil. Pure luck! Dread to think what the place would have been like if they had no oil and had to rely on the people. Maybe what's its like today! War torn and a shit hole.
8398 2018-01-13 19:55:35 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

8400 2018-01-13 19:55:24 Techniques used to sell the invasion of Iraq to steal oil: 

"WMD"
"Imminent threat"
"Can reach US shores with deadly weapons"
"9/11"

Consider these when hearing anything about North Korea and their trillions of dollars of mineral deposits. Propagandists re-use old tools.
8401 2018-01-13 19:55:23 Even if Trump said it, I don't have a problem with it because, for one thing, it's the truth, & for another thing, Trump doesn't talk like snake oil selling politicians. He's a plain spoken New Yorker. It's refreshing to me.

8411 2018-01-13 19:53:34 Won't happen. Norway has one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. Didn't fritter away oil revenues on tax cuts like UK. Investments throughout the world will keep it rich. Very different from UK.

8413 2018-01-13 19:53:30 Its high time Africa proves to @realDonaldTrump That we ain't a shithole continent. Let us deny the US our oil, bases for their trainings and attacks on their enemies. Let's deny them our diamonds, gold and other minerals. Its time to prove to the world that Trump is the shithole
8414 2018-01-13 19:53:27 Same as oil. Long as it's there and there are lobbyists it's going to be an issue
8415 2018-01-13 19:53:26 @Walmart love it. At 1 hr and 9 minutes for a simple oil change and the car hasn’t even made it into the garage yet. 5 mechanics from what I can see. 1 car in shop.
8416 2018-01-13 19:53:25 Woot woot.. oil change..
8417 2018-01-13 19:53:16 Really not. Comparing a country of a little over 5 million to a country of 320 million is misleading. Also that smaller country happens to be the 5th largest exporter of oil.

8428 2018-01-13 19:51:43 Nigeria, fir example. has a GDP of over 405 billion & is the 20th largest economy on earth (mostly from oil). I think your own bias affects what you consider "poor" nations.
8429 2018-01-13 19:51:41 Yes. A giant shithole with huge oil reserves and gorgeous beaches. Number 14 in the richest countries in the world is also one of the most dangerous shitholes in the world,

8439 2018-01-13 19:50:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8440 2018-01-13 19:49:58 I ran out of makeup wipes so I did something kinda crazy today. Covered my whole face in olive oil. Wiped it down with a hot rag, did a charcoal peel then used a clay mask. My skin feels fucking amazing!

8449 2018-01-13 19:49:03 I agree, but I can’t find them totally at fault if they have no power over immigration or any control over the oil resources or even the ability to cancel WMD contracts/Aircraft carriers. We’d choose another path I’m sure.

8453 2018-01-13 19:48:17 It’s crazy how EVERY SINGLE person at this oil change place needs their air filter replaced 
8454 2018-01-13 19:48:16 Not to forget that Venezuela has the largest crude oil reserves in the world!! 
8455 2018-01-13 19:48:10 I need to tighten the bolt for my oil pan just a tinyyyy but but my cars to low to reach my hand under it. And I’m to lazy to jack it up.
8456 2018-01-13 19:48:01 Yes! I was just about to follow up with something like this. Im afraid, however, that love of oil money and stubbornness will mean we wait until it’s of extremely vital importance, but happy to see a rise in good urbanism.

8549 2018-01-13 19:36:37 Well, we rspect ur concerns.The tweets which posted were scheduled much prior to the incident.I think u hv some idea abt how social media works. Nobody can foresee an accidnt in Oil & gas sector. @BP_plc I am sure knows abt it post #GulfofMexico crisis. @BP_India
8550 2018-01-13 19:36:26 His saying the truth; see the leaders we are parading in Africa. South Africans are killing Nigerians, Fulani is killing Benue people. Kaduna has turned to kidnappers’ den. Kogi has refuse to pay salary. Fuel scarcity in a country producing oil
8551 2018-01-13 19:36:15 Aha ! Kono na kono south movie theke copy kore paste kore debe, r ki ??? @JuyeMandal oil ta kom lagao
8552 2018-01-13 19:36:12 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
8553 2018-01-13 19:36:09 Very confident they will extract oil from mengo. Next two weeks update on rig and license renewal.
8554 2018-01-13 19:35:47 Gotta wait an hour and a half for an oil change 
8555 2018-01-13 19:35:35 Check out Cocokind! Not sure if they have an eye cream specifically but they have a great coconut face oil that might do the trick!!
8556 2018-01-13 19:35:30 I have been on CBD oil and Hempseed capsules for over a year. Shame on the Federal Government. Hemp products saves lives. Help me understand
8557 2018-01-13 19:35:27 Just like the oil the money will dry up then we will see what happens
8558 2018-01-13 19:35:21 ترا زي يوم تروحين حديقه وتجلسين مع عائلتك وتنبسطين كلها فيها نساء ورجال ليه مكبرين الموضوع؟
8559 2018-01-13 19:35:19 Your distant Norwegian relatives also obtain 22% of their GDP from oil and gas production and it represents 67% of their exports.

Are you for drilling for more oil and building more pipelines so we can do the same to fund healthcare?

Serious question.
8560 2018-01-13 19:35:18 The way Real Madrid and Ronaldo are playing these days, is like they want to discover crude oil by going down.
8561 2018-01-13 19:34:59 Ugh I hate it when that happens. Especially when I can’t sleep. By the way I have yet another question. What would be the best crystal, oil , incense and candle to use to help open my 3rd eye while meditating?
8562 2018-01-13 19:34:50 pursuing our oil in this same "shithole" country. 
These two stories must highlight for Trump just how much humanity needs each other in all facets. 
That said, in the absence of an unconditional apology and contrite retraction from President Trump for his racist, bigoted and /2
8563 2018-01-13 19:34:43 The olive oil works beautifully well with the berries 
8564 2018-01-13 19:34:35 According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Perdue has received over $180,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.
8565 2018-01-13 19:34:30 Is that why you decided to start drilling for oil all around the coasts except for Florida. Humm
8566 2018-01-13 19:34:26 Weekends for me are basically for putting oil in my hair and to move care free in my house cause these are only two days when I don't go anywhere outside.
8567 2018-01-13 19:34:23 So true! Reminds me of “you do you, girl!” I have extra rewards of burning the midnight oil all week - a beach vacation without my laptop - a first for me! 
8568 2018-01-13 19:34:16 It smell better than the castor oil to me lol so I’ll pick it up
8569 2018-01-13 19:34:11 Buying oil on 1.6x higher rate as compare to us, NO access to cheap pipe running burning fule/gas.
8570 2018-01-13 19:34:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i started crying over pizza please i love live fan
8571 2018-01-13 19:34:06 Want to make your mani last longer? Apply nail oil daily to keep chips at bay #manicuremonday
8572 2018-01-13 19:33:49 Time passed slowly.
Streams of water were forced to flow over the permafrosted land.
A gorge was formed.
Permeable limestone was carved into caves.
Stalagmites 
and stalactites grew.
The Ice Age finally retreated.
And Bill still couldn't get the oil drain nut undone.
8573 2018-01-13 19:33:48 You know me james no messing around give the berries lots of time to mature in flavour ready for next week filming!! Thank you again James for the produce 
8574 2018-01-13 19:33:48 Tea tree oil
8575 2018-01-13 19:33:47 @MikeBoninLA is the BIGGEST JOKE of a politician. 
Playing lip service to progressive issues. 
Bonin failed in banning fracking in 2014. He thinks he can take on big oil?
A real leader would ban oil drilling and succeed. Not put out a toothless resolution #RecallBonin
8576 2018-01-13 19:33:43 Mexico oil plant blast: A Love Story Land in USA y niños
8577 2018-01-13 19:33:29 You’re late to the party with that hot take. Oil fans are already well aware of that disastrous trade and what could have been
8578 2018-01-13 19:33:17 Simple and sweet, love it!  Is it worth tossing some olive oil and a garlic clove into the bag (doing water displacement, don’t have vacuum sealer) or just salt and pepper only?
8579 2018-01-13 19:33:09 Aw "Pastor" Mark Burns. You are too generous. I imagine in another lifetime he was dragged forcibly out of a temple. He traveled the land selling snake oil. In this incarnation, having learned nothing, is selling hate for the paltry pieces of gold trump promises to toss his way.
8580 2018-01-13 19:33:09 ช่วงนี้แปลกๆ
8581 2018-01-13 19:32:56 always hilarious when you get a basic oil change & the mechanics start bringing you pieces of your car to replace when you don’t need them done.
8582 2018-01-13 19:32:48 Tbh it’s mostly African foreigners who do that now.
8583 2018-01-13 19:32:40 Right. Agreed. I wouldn't want to live in close proximity to military exercises 24/7. 

My point was- I stayed at beach house built on strictly protected turtle habitat, yet 6+ oil rigs were built offshore within eye-shot of the same beach.
8584 2018-01-13 19:32:33 Desperately need $1000 to fix our damn car. Anyone know of quick ways to make cash? Oils leaking from oil cooler, and making it impossible to drive and valve cover went to shit. @BMW thanks for making great cars
8585 2018-01-13 19:32:31 There is a reason I also don't discuss religion & politics, they don't match.

As I said before I have no faith in institutional religions, I also feel church and state are like oil and water.

Oil and water does not mix
8586 2018-01-13 19:32:06 So your funded by Canadian oil sand and your opinion is not valid.. oh and I helped fund her when I bought her book..
8587 2018-01-13 19:32:05 that was fast work Polly, those berries had hardly been picked before you got them on your stove!
8588 2018-01-13 19:31:40 This is stupid. It's disrespectful on so many levels. Still, being that I have a good sense of humor, I have to admit that by the time I read oil under ice and more big water I couldn't help but laugh. I love a good joke.
8589 2018-01-13 19:31:37 @DIAMOND6916    We are suppliers and distributors of different varieties of hash, oil, vaporizer, and medical marijuana strains that is good for cancer, others illness.
8590 2018-01-13 19:31:18 I hate getting my oil changed they always try to rip me off! I don’t know what that fuel engine carborator windshield wiper extractor filter is but i don’t want it
8591 2018-01-13 19:31:18 Yep. and they can shove their Rape Seed Oil up their hoops n all,  Neonicotinoid laden bee murdering bastards

8593 2018-01-13 19:30:51 smoking helps me a ton, CBD oil is good too. in the midst of a full-blown panic attack i just embrace the paralysis to fully focus on my breathing and remind myself that it physically has to end at some point
8594 2018-01-13 19:30:45 Sounds like our fuel companies need some Prussian style persuasion tactics to let go of that oil.
8595 2018-01-13 19:30:18 Let's make 2018 the best year yet! Cure Oils can help you with all of your essential oil needs.
8596 2018-01-13 19:30:14 Stupid. US sells OUR OWN oil/gas to China in latest trade deals. Shoulda built refineries and pipelines 30 years ago huh?
8597 2018-01-13 19:30:09 I'm STILL having trouble grokking the idea of Norway being a European shithole before the oil. Esp since I have a lot of Helly Hansen winter gear so clearly they have SOME niche industries.

8600 2018-01-13 19:29:52 Norway which first discovered oil off its shores in 1969, plows its revenue into a massive sovereign wealth fund that pays for state pensions and other expenses. The fund recently topped $1 trillion. So they plow money back into the country not into the top 1%.
8601 2018-01-13 19:29:45 I was on the SSOF 2014 run... as long as the general outlook was positive for oil SSOF continued to climb... even on the oil pullbacks. Not saying that will happen again of course. We shall see right.
8602 2018-01-13 19:29:25 Praise like oil
8603 2018-01-13 19:29:24 Seriously Alvaro Morata might be our solution for fuel Scarcity, Make we just they bump oil from his hair.

8606 2018-01-13 19:28:53 Oh no, Amma apply lots of baby oil.. Gonna get really slepry tonight.   
8607 2018-01-13 19:28:37 My side! Can’t get a picture like that at Lucas Oil
8608 2018-01-13 19:28:27 The “Energy In Depth” project would not be possible without the financial commitments of: El Paso Corporation, XTO Energy, Occidental Petroleum, BP, Anadarko, Marathon, EnCana, Chevron, Talisman, Shell, API, IPAA, Halliburton, Schlumberger and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.
8609 2018-01-13 19:28:04 Nope, if you’re buying a new bike from a shop, it’ll have VAT included in price. As will all the brake pads, tyres, oil etc you need.

Bike to work scheme is a salary sacrifice scheme where you pay for the bike out of pre tax salary (similar schemes exist to buy cars, computers)
8610 2018-01-13 19:27:57 The hype for coconut oil lowkey faded
8611 2018-01-13 19:27:56 “Barbara I don’t care if you get any damn popcorn but I’m not eating any if you put that damn buttery oil crap on it!”

-Something a man named Gerald said at the movie theatre (We are seeing the same movie. Hooray!)
8612 2018-01-13 19:27:45 So you would rather some other state or country take on that risk. You know everyone needs oil and gas but you want it at the expense of others. Your new luxury helicopter does run on oil and gas right? It's not going to power itself.
8613 2018-01-13 19:26:51 It's beyond mind blowing that this Administration is NOT taking cyber security SERIOUSLY. 
Are we waiting for "others" to hack our electrical grids, air traffic control, oil rigs in the Oceans, communications, AND ELECTIONS? 
Putin is in the OVAL OFFICE PPL.
8614 2018-01-13 19:26:50 Good, water could have oil / petrol in it, far from funny. Only #idiots do it
8615 2018-01-13 19:26:37 Necesitaría un fuel oil en maldondado 
8616 2018-01-13 19:26:28 Donald Trump has a "fatberg" (huge ball of domestic oil wastes going down the sinks, others rubbish wastes), and found in the London sewage system, but there are fatbergs in other cities too) in his head.
8617 2018-01-13 19:26:28 PMB is just a criminal as the rest if he wanted to save Nigeria he won’t waste $2 billion trying to discover oil in the north when we all know the north will do better with that money for agriculture or  call back Maine who was accused of stealing
8618 2018-01-13 19:26:16 They are cunts, the lot of them, If they eat Soya, Palm oil, Almond milk, Avocados they are cunts
8619 2018-01-13 19:26:15 Well your right but that’s the way it is and always will be until we get a Russian oil tycoon or a Sheikh. That’s exactly why when people say we need to or should have won things I think why.
8620 2018-01-13 19:26:14 Trump 2017:  ISIS Caliphate...DEAD. Iran Deal...PUNKED. America 1st National security...implemented. Paris accord...FRACKED. No-to DACA, Illegal amnesty. NO-to unvetted immigrants. NEIL...FREAKIN...GORSUCH.

8621 2018-01-13 19:25:50 The youths in the south must learn to stand up,even if we have no common tongue. They think us yahoo boys and oil hungry but we are and have been more than that . #Area @EDOSOCIAL @DeltaState @phcityonline
8622 2018-01-13 19:25:50 My car has all brand new tires, new brake pads, I got and oil change and she's so fresh.. I'm satisfied 
8623 2018-01-13 19:25:48 if South Africa had oil, we'd still have apartheid, and Mandella would've died in jail. Shameful international collaboration. #saudi
8624 2018-01-13 19:25:47 Hey @ShannonSharpe bruh you could use some blackseed oil. I'm telling my dawg this oil ain't no joke!
8625 2018-01-13 19:25:09 LOL my friend you are a blessing! Just got back from a bike ride in the sun getting vitamin D & releasing natural cannabinoids along side the Mighty Fast oil thats so blissfully lifting us up right there into deep space 9. We'll HIGH five you when we pass you by!!!!

8627 2018-01-13 19:25:04 Living in a literal "dream state" (Alaska), and being a patriot?
Totally agree.
You should go defend Sean Penn now, and they way he supported Hugo Chavez' socialist destruction of Venezuela. You know, where people are starving to death in an oil rich country?
8628 2018-01-13 19:24:47 You take ya car to a dealership just to do an oil change next thing you know the mechanic telling you your car has a bunch of problems and it got car aids.
8629 2018-01-13 19:24:44 I used hot springs sulfur soap which is great for getting rid of acne scars, it does brighten your skin a bit but you could also try a vitamin E & tea tree oil mix.
8630 2018-01-13 19:24:42 We have the same " holes" here in America. Look at the places, their governments, the way they treat their people. Shitholes is a good description. If you don't fix the shithole, the over immigration will never stop. Why aren't we leaning on those governments? No oil? Hmm
8631 2018-01-13 19:24:35 Has anyone been thinking about trying CBD oil but still has questions? Comment below or message me. I can help :) 
8632 2018-01-13 19:24:18 To be fair I also used coconut oil on my hands to lessen the stains so that accounts for some of it
8633 2018-01-13 19:24:17 BTW - Stock market all time high, illegals down unemployment down, companies paying bonuses, moving back to the USA laws being enforced HRC being investigated, Isis really on the run oil, gas and coal back in production - wow Pres Trump doing terrible???
8634 2018-01-13 19:24:04 Baby oil is essential.
8635 2018-01-13 19:24:00 Yeah dude that started just a few years ago, before that we had more than a decade of 120$ per oil barrel, corrupted government officials and a dumbass communist policy it's the only explanation for this situation
8636 2018-01-13 19:23:56 CO2 emission while getting the coconut oil to Ireland? Was it produced abusing workers  rights? There are other environmental costs attached to being plastic free. BTW we were using soda when toothpaste wasn't available in my childhood.
8637 2018-01-13 19:23:52 Rather than let the riches from oil only go to oil companies, the state run oil company is taxed at 80%, and the money goes into a sovereign wealth fun that gets reinvested in European and American equities.
8638 2018-01-13 19:23:36 let me stop your response, oil is bad, and any comforts it brings isnt worth the cost of humanity. there is better way!
8639 2018-01-13 19:23:16 I honestly prefer yam and oil to yam and egg
8640 2018-01-13 19:23:08 Viajaban en un carromato decorado con el nombre del producto: "DOCTOR BROWN'S SNAKE OIL", un crecepelo 'milagroso'.

8643 2018-01-13 19:22:52 try to oil your scalp and then take some painkillers beware that in the next couple of days it’s probably gonna itch like crazy

8648 2018-01-13 19:22:09 It's very apparent now that the only way to protect any state in the US from a threat created by the Moron (nuclear war) or Zinke (oil drilling) is to build a Trump property on it.
8649 2018-01-13 19:22:07 probably will wait until oil pulls back a little
8650 2018-01-13 19:21:59 Oil defuser lit. Rain falling. Coffe made and book in hand. 
8651 2018-01-13 19:21:50 Anschutz fortune hides a crime, like all fortunes. "following year, he acquired 9 million acres (36,000 km²) along the Utah-Wyoming border." Oil underneath this ranch...

8653 2018-01-13 19:21:49 I've started avoiding oil changes because every time I go I have to listen to some bro tell me about my life. "You should have come in 2,000 miles ago," "oil is very important to the running of your car", "you need to keep on top of it." Change my oil and go away please.
8654 2018-01-13 19:21:41 Pork coming on and oil ready for roasties. #notgoodfordiet 
8655 2018-01-13 19:21:37 You are welcome! Depending on how the oil pools when you bake it, you may need to flip it over to cool/drain. I just put a baking sheet under mine.
8656 2018-01-13 19:21:34 You didn't stand against dictators like #TPLF juntas and toy #HailemariamDesalegn #Albashir #IsaiyasAfeworqe of Eriteria, South Sudanese President, your neghibour Nigerian government with oil. None of our nation want to leave their fathers land & choose to be sold by Arabs!
8657 2018-01-13 19:21:20 Warming olive oil and the putting it on a cotton ball..it really helps with ear infection pain...that's my current situation
8658 2018-01-13 19:21:17 This oil change place is packed 
8659 2018-01-13 19:21:07 
8660 2018-01-13 19:21:06 Forget I’m supposed to get an oil change today I hope the place don’t close by the time I get there
8661 2018-01-13 19:21:02 The Hawaii thing is perhaps just an old machine juddering after application of some oil and a gentle hammer tap.

8665 2018-01-13 19:20:54 I don't want Oprah as President for a host of reasons including her education policy and history of snake oil--but she's more capable at every facet of leadership than Trump by a factor that cannot be calculated
8666 2018-01-13 19:20:53 The idea that our, dated emergency response systems could be hacked to start hysteria, seems outlandish. 
Let's step back and think about it though; 
@POTUS has a short fuse and wants to engage with #NoKo
#Russia was just caught giving #NoKo oil. They also have hacked us
8667 2018-01-13 19:20:51 If y’all have that oil over there add that in too
8668 2018-01-13 19:20:48 كم سعره
8669 2018-01-13 19:20:46 The garage I took my car too went above and beyond and cleaned the entire undercarriage of my car...theres no oil anywhere. Talk about service.... Def going back there again!
8670 2018-01-13 19:20:43 I use Dr Teals epsom salt bubble bath & in the shower, I use a scrub I make w coffee grinds, brown sugar & coconut oil. It’s divine. Also, collagen protein powder keeps my skin super hydrated.
8671 2018-01-13 19:20:38 Aloe vera, shea butter, coconut oil...Lovely. I really admire these #TeamNatural people, but I am yet to see one of them use ogbono as facial mask or hair gel.
8672 2018-01-13 19:20:30 @FLOTUS @dacullington /2, 18 people have died, 6 still missing.  Santa Barbaran’s desperately need tourism this summer.  We need clean beaches to attract tourists.  Cruise ships come into the harbor and tourists shop downtown.  If we experience another oil spill as we did 2 years
8673 2018-01-13 19:20:30 I don't shop at Target because they had that hacking thing. I don't shop at Amazon because Amazon is killing the physical stores that Walmart didn't. Costco doesn't fit my needs. I don't need a 5 gallon jug of olive oil that will go rancid before I can use it all.
8674 2018-01-13 19:20:25 Why even use oil at all 
8675 2018-01-13 19:20:24 Going to put some fresh bedding on my bed, get a shower coconut oil my hair and put on a lush face mask! Time to pamper myself to see if I can feel human again! Been really down lately

8677 2018-01-13 19:20:09 Obviously, this proves there is no oil there.

And where do you get the Argan oil?
8680 2018-01-13 19:19:25 That’s because it’s all about the billing hours for selling the snake oil.
8681 2018-01-13 19:19:20 You still thinking about sauteing tidepods with a splash of garlic infused olive oil and chopped scallions?

8683 2018-01-13 19:18:54 plus we have enginered products and solutions that replace most all oil products, all are sustainable!
8684 2018-01-13 19:18:51 With all these electric vehicles being fabricated. Most assume less supply needed means price goes down but Oil is different. When less is used the price goes up to keep those in business operational. Lobbyists have a part in play too. So yes. Oil will see a slow flow up. Opinion

8687 2018-01-13 19:18:44 Dude, Perhaps if African countries hadn't been raped of gold,diamonds,Cooper,uranium  bauxite,oil etc by colonial Europeans and latterly USA then they may have been in a position to use these natural resources to their own advantage and not to fill the coffers of their opressors

8755 2018-01-13 19:09:15 If I learnt anything from going to the shop to get oil changes, etc done is that I need to learn how to do it myself. I don’t think installing a cabin filter REALLY costs $48 + the cost of the filter...

ben: lol walks away
8783 2018-01-13 19:04:16 Is this from use? My best suggestion would be to re-season by rubbing vegetable oil on it with a paper towel or cloth and then baking it for an hour at 400*F, then let it cool completely in the oven. I have a 60ish year old dutch oven that I resuscitated this way. 
8784 2018-01-13 19:04:00 I am not sure that Iowans understand what International CorporateColonialism is all about.  Particularly one controlled by theOil Cartel.
8785 2018-01-13 19:03:44 BTW, I don't hunt at all. Don't "like" to kill. I capture spiders & let 'em go outside. Yet if I have to, I'll *snap* mousetrap. I try to use sticky traps, it's not hard to get them loose (tiny bit of vegetable oil) & release. There are vids on Youtube on how to do it safely 
8786 2018-01-13 19:03:37 Crush a few cloves of garlic, kidogo lemon juice, add kidogo veg oil, dark soy sauce kiasi, some salt and black pepper. Mix all with the nyama and Let it chill in the fridge for abt 1or 2hrs. Preheat the oven at 150°c and let it cook for 45mins. Thank me later

8799 2018-01-13 19:02:46 Negative. There are many factors that determine a companies worth. For instance,  CHIT’s AS is 15billion - SSOF is 500m... SSOF SS is maxed meaning zero no shares can hit the market.. with oil heating up, SSOF turning a profit, & no new shares able to dilute SSOF is looking good.

8835 2018-01-13 19:00:14 And while I'm at it, the vicious nationalist instinct and specifically hatred and resentment of Sweden which defined the Norwegian character until and after the discovery of North Sea Oil puts the you on very shaky ground for decrying through America version.
8836 2018-01-13 18:59:59 Little, piddly thing that bugs me about fantasy worlds:

If there was no era(s) of dinosaurs and no subsequent mass-extinction event, and/or no tectonic plates, then how does oil exist as a viable resource?
8837 2018-01-13 18:59:55 Legendary oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens, 89, is closing his hedge fund, saying trading oil has lost its luster < Pickens earned much of his wealth in the energy futures market after turning 75 in 2003 #Oil #USA #business

8843 2018-01-13 18:58:07 None of even #African countries with huge oil reserves #Nigeria #Angola has done that. #Uganda excited about its oil may be like #UK
8844 2018-01-13 18:58:05 to put it simply: cursed blood turned cursed oil turned cursed fire turned loss of frame rates.... BUT WE USUALLY WON!!!
8845 2018-01-13 18:58:05 Holidays may be over, but hunger never rests. 
For those of you burning the midnight oil,

8846 2018-01-13 18:58:04 the sheer amount of oil in that hair... Morata so desperate to shine
8847 2018-01-13 18:57:46 We would come off the train in Sheepshead Bay and get a slice from the Place downstairs you had to fold the pizza and tip it over the garbage pail outside to take off some of the extr oil but be careful you didn’t lose any cheese. 
8848 2018-01-13 18:57:41 Oil topped $70/bbl in London on Thursday for the 1st time in 3 years as production cuts by OPEC & rising demand whittle away a global surplus #Oil #Brent #UK #business

8860 2018-01-13 18:55:48 At a few petals each per teaspoon, in competition with the rest being black tea and bergamot oil, I suspect the white and blue are more for visual effect than taste.
8861 2018-01-13 18:55:48 @DeptofDefense Can we add the value of Kraft's ring to Russia's debt?  Check on that.  Next shipment of oil from China/Russia to N Korea will be very costly?

8863 2018-01-13 18:55:42 @AppleSupport I wonder if IOS system update would work with Honda cars if Steve Jobs was running Apple. My entire phone system is corrupted after a routine oil change.

8865 2018-01-13 18:55:21 Perpetual motion. Bit like the wifes mouth. I don't know, you read of some incredible possibilities for clean free energy but all the time there's gas and oil in the ground, and multinationals, it's not going to happen any time soon.
8866 2018-01-13 18:55:16 Haha oh my word. So butter and oil are not cool but ghee is?  people need to educate themselves 
8867 2018-01-13 18:55:12 Right why is Middlewich leaking oil because it fucking stinks
8868 2018-01-13 18:55:08 The worst thing is when you’re getting your oil changed and they tell you all this other stuff that you need 
8869 2018-01-13 18:54:52 “don’t get tricked by revenue sharing promises from oil companies...our coasts are not for sale” @senbillnelson tells #EVCO2018 crowd

8878 2018-01-13 18:53:18 High doses of omega-3 from flax seed oil helps very much with anxiety, 4,000mg first thing in the AM with 1000mg vitamin C also works for pain.  Do not consume minerals, multi vitamins have minerals, that increase pain and anxiety, this is just my research on my own body.

8886 2018-01-13 18:52:11 I just told the Hyundai people that “I’m samuel’s dad and I’m here for an oil change” AND THEY SAID SAMUELS DAD?!? AND I SAID SHIT NO IM HIS DAUGHTER. IM EMBARRASSING
8887 2018-01-13 18:52:05 @AppleSupport  Honda said Apple can't give them a date when the phone software will be fixed. My entire system including radio buttons don't work after going for an oil change.
8888 2018-01-13 18:52:05 One of my standard dinners is couscous with dried cherries, italian seasoning, and basil olive oil, does that count.
8889 2018-01-13 18:52:01 Let’s tell him loud! You don’t find GOLD, DIAMONDS, OIL in shitholes. Not to add the amount of human talents
8890 2018-01-13 18:51:40 Tim:  This should not b surprising. Look what a snake oil salesman and flim-flam artist has achieved in the USA. Potus. I now believe that anything, no matter how ridiculous, is possible.
8891 2018-01-13 18:51:37 my moms young doctor friend gave her a whole presentation on the benefits of cannabis oil...is this lady not rubbing this stuff all over me as we speak

8898 2018-01-13 18:50:59 Anybody need any Cologne Oils or Perfume Oil
8899 2018-01-13 18:50:52 lemon essential oil

8902 2018-01-13 18:50:39 Woke up this morning to find out that drunk Brittney made a salad as her 1AM snack. A SALAD. With arugula, sunflower seeds, olive oil and vinegar, spinach, and a boiled egg. She even put the bowl in the sink. 

I’m truly amazed with myself.
8903 2018-01-13 18:50:32 I’ve always loved olives on pizza, but this is also my daughter’s favourite and we always share a pIzza there. Roberto appropriately calls her Olive Oil, and gives her a bowl of olives as an appetizer each time.
8904 2018-01-13 18:50:26 The swamp has a lot of oil in it.
8905 2018-01-13 18:50:22 i got somebody to oil me up don’t worry.
8906 2018-01-13 18:50:11 So I guess if ur right oil wells freeze but NGLs don’t?! NGL production grew significantly in that weekly data set.. only logical explanation is reclassification. #OOTT

8909 2018-01-13 18:49:54 No. I didn’t forget the oil. I’ve actually been to Norway. My point is that Trump has a crush on a country that politically and socially is everything he is supposed to dislike.
8910 2018-01-13 18:49:47 Took the benzo out for a run. Still shines. Need to give it an oil change.
8911 2018-01-13 18:49:43 @AppleSupport  Get the phone update for Honda cars fixed ASAP!!! Went for oil change, left with no phone database. Wiped out due to Apple's IOS update. Android still works.
8912 2018-01-13 18:49:28 They do... My dad will kick me if I go without an oil change #mechanic'sdaughter
8913 2018-01-13 18:49:22 تسلمون على هذا الطرح النظيف

8916 2018-01-13 18:48:59 Use it like you would oil. It has a high smoke point so you can get crunch without it burning. Season and rub down a while chicken with it and bake. Etc.
8917 2018-01-13 18:48:45 Rose water + jojoba or vitamin e oil

8921 2018-01-13 18:48:12 I got my car on to my jack-stands all ready to go to change the oil just to realize my brother took my tools 
8922 2018-01-13 18:48:00 @AppleSupport Shame on Tim Cook and Honda. Came for oil change, left with no phone database, voice recognition or stereo buttons. Disgraceful!!
8923 2018-01-13 18:48:00 First time my uncle ever took me to Rome to see the Circus 
i was mystified by the gladiators shouting that we should use 
Mycenees's Olive Oil for our baths and cooking both. 

Now they have reversed that message entirely.
8924 2018-01-13 18:47:48 dude i am not a  leftist, nor i am a proponent of capitalism. I simply do not see a connection between socialism and failure of an economic system. All the oil based economies are in troubled waters today. They are all diversifying their business to survive.
8925 2018-01-13 18:47:37 “This magical beard oil really does give me a fuller look!”
8926 2018-01-13 18:47:28 And soon in major European food halls.

8928 2018-01-13 18:47:26 Any oil will break down latex, that's true. Which is why I'm a huge fan of lube.
8929 2018-01-13 18:47:19 JUST LEAVE STICKY NOTES EVERYWHERE

"DON'T HARVEST OIL"

"DON'T DESTROY FORESTS TO PUT IN PLANET DESTROYING FACTORIES"

"USE ECO-FRIENDLY ENERGY PLEASE"

"DON'T FIGHT EACH OTHER FOR NO REASON"
8930 2018-01-13 18:47:13 I use organic extra virgin coconut oil on my dogs to help itchy skin and raw spots... It's amazing!  It smells really good too!!
8931 2018-01-13 18:47:03 Only because of the arab oil money....they would be nothing without them.
8932 2018-01-13 18:46:56 as a whole we need to stop telling each other what we need to or can’t do with our skin care routine, it’s cool to offer things that worked for you, but telling me I need coconut oil to fix my hormonal caused acne isn’t gonna help me.
8933 2018-01-13 18:46:54 You're living it. The NHS, roads, welfare, public services, low taxes, cost of living, education. Norway's oil fund is heavily leveraged so not quite the pot at the end of the rainbow you imagine. How much tax revenue generated in north sea last year?
8934 2018-01-13 18:46:52 There are things that I want to remember to do for myself for forever. 

- take thorough showers
- put coconut oil on before I get out.
8935 2018-01-13 18:46:34 Waiting to get my oil change...every time I go to a car lot I think about how me and @muvagambino showed out in Memphis 
8936 2018-01-13 18:46:34 Are you talking about organization, planning...etc? I've written a research book on oil politics. I can give you some advice that I personally found useful.
8937 2018-01-13 18:46:30 I should really comb out my hair and put a hot oil treatment in. But the thought of raising my arm above my shoulder sounds awful at present.
8938 2018-01-13 18:46:28 The UK wouldn't exist and without oil and Brexit then rUk would be fucked especially the damage to Sterling.
8939 2018-01-13 18:46:28 Yeah and they'd probay be like cracked and stuff, right?

Hmm. Maybe half coconut oil half shortening/margarine.

I do half butter/lard in my buttermilk biscuits and this binding combo works fine.
(I do like butter in biscuits, just nothing sweet)
8940 2018-01-13 18:46:26 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
8941 2018-01-13 18:46:24 Here the moral authorities of the world and media...Slavery of Biafra Jews, GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians by the British govt and their jihadists, Stealing of Oil resources and Continued daily killing of Biafrans. Media SILENCE= morality.
8942 2018-01-13 18:46:16 Not to mention extreme poverty & homelessness. A lack of healthcare, hospitals are literally dumping poor/sick ppl on the streets. Massive opioid crisis. Education ranking is plummeting. Cops slaughtering citizens. US being left behind other countries, as we cling to oil/coal
8943 2018-01-13 18:46:12 so how come they can't sort out their shithole country then if so educated, they can't even get their own oil out of the ground by themselves
8944 2018-01-13 18:46:09 shoutout coconut oil

8946 2018-01-13 18:45:50 Senior moment, I forgot my magnesium oil post workout. Yes those systemic enzymes eat away at fibrinogen like pac man. Have my trail friend take 1 an hour for his 100 mile races for one thing.
8947 2018-01-13 18:45:10 How many times does this team get help, are Spurs being sponsored by the Premier league and FA to win premiership to keep global audience interested? Rather than oil money league winners!
Reason classed as best because anyone could win, now justcouple of teams
8948 2018-01-13 18:45:03 As dr swamy said in the past , just ignore him and stop following him. His popularity has gone down significantly. Just one reply for his "oil money " tweet today . He was getting more than 1000 replies in past
8949 2018-01-13 18:44:53 maybe its helping pay for WMDS, HSR2 etc, cos a do know WE have to contribute fck with that oil fund we could pay for the lot

8953 2018-01-13 18:43:57 I hate when @jaredsimmons04 starts the car before opening the garage door and now at the oil changing place 6 men are standing in a closed garage with cars running. 
8954 2018-01-13 18:43:49 is that right, so by that logic we should be like Norway, with a billion dollar oil fund, where is THAT kept in Scotland as your telling me ALL the money generated here is kept here am sure many would love to know, where it is,over to you ???
8955 2018-01-13 18:43:25 SHAPE: Often use a massage oil.
8956 2018-01-13 18:43:06 Student life is one of our sacrificing part of life..as we burn the midnight oil,keep aside all the unnecessary doings that make it seems like punishing ourselves.
8957 2018-01-13 18:42:48 Why r you stupid Dems against everything good for America? The more we drill, the less indepence we r on foreign oil. I just don’t understand ur stupidity on this, and the opposition to tax cuts. U care nothing for us, only illegals.
8958 2018-01-13 18:42:44 We've come too far to turn back now. Suffering under LIARS, CHEATERS, THIEVES (BIG BANKS, WALL ST, OIL) is not okay any more. REAL Progressive Policies matter. Why are we seeing YEMEN & Palestine falling apart? BIG MONEY is involved. We need good Policies. Follow the Money in WAR
8959 2018-01-13 18:42:43 Best mix is my morning cup of coffee and drags off my oil pen

8965 2018-01-13 18:41:29 @GovernorTomWolf Now that PA has medical marijuana I'm still bewildered why we can't grow industrial hemp for clothing, omega 3/6 supplements? If you want hemp oil on your salad it costs $100 for a tiny bottle yet hemp is the best source of omega 3/6. Hemp isn't marijuana!

8968 2018-01-13 18:41:01 Ah, okay. I knew Scandinavia had a significant forestry industry but wasn't aware of the full scale and assumed you were talking about Norway's oil. Thanks for the image!
8969 2018-01-13 18:40:59 Working on taxes. My husband texts me to say "when is your car registration due? We need to change the oil." UGH I CAN'T ADULT ANY MORE! #timetowatchMLP

8972 2018-01-13 18:40:49 Norway’s stat are great all because of oil.
8973 2018-01-13 18:40:46 £15 for one jar of coconut oil, dropped £33 at the drug store and bought some presents for my boyfriend..oops
8974 2018-01-13 18:40:31 Sorry, I grew up in poverty. $20.00 a week gross before taxes will NOT raise anyone out of poverty. You're a snake oil salesman trying to sell the ppl that this will make a difference in their life. It WON'T! Like Trump you believe if you tell a lie often enough ppl will believe.
8975 2018-01-13 18:40:30 Popcorns are normally fried in thesame pot,in thesame oil, at thesame time and under thesame heat conditions.
But they do not all pop at thesame time.
YOUR TIME IS NOT MY TIME but we'll all pop.
8976 2018-01-13 18:40:21 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
8977 2018-01-13 18:40:19 The way real Madrid is sinking it's only a matter of time they discover oil
8978 2018-01-13 18:40:13 do you know which ones? i just got Eli an essential oil diffuser for his birthday!
8979 2018-01-13 18:40:12 Did you say the oil was on the inside or outside of the plug? It makes a big difference.
8980 2018-01-13 18:40:08 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
8981 2018-01-13 18:40:07 Playing: Snake Oil Salesman - Prawn (Run)
8982 2018-01-13 18:40:05 At Avitas, we put our heart and soul into our cannabis oil, and work with world-class manufacturers to bring you the purest cartridges possible. We want you to stay safe and knowledgable about what goes into your body.
8983 2018-01-13 18:39:57 I decided to break the Carleton County norm and make curry chicken for supper. I start by frying the chicken in olive oil before putting it in the slow cooker. Mom says, "Hey, that smells different"! Nope, sorry mom. Just olive oil and chicken. #notmeatandpotatoestoday
8984 2018-01-13 18:39:51 I like the one here, back home they look at me like I’m not supposed to be in there. I be like, I’m only here for French baguette and tea tree oil sis 
8985 2018-01-13 18:39:37 Are they going to outlaw all oil in NYC? That would eliminate heating oil, gasoline, diesel fuel, plastics including pvc, pharmaceuticals, etc...
8986 2018-01-13 18:39:29 เฮียเปิดใจให้แท งั้นก็ช่วยรักให้มากๆๆนะ  #เด็กแว๊นกุกวี
8987 2018-01-13 18:39:25 My mom bought castor oil for me & my brothers  kuzonyiwa  ksasa literally. 
8988 2018-01-13 18:39:21 I’m sitting in firestone waiting for an oil change listening to these white men make fun of an Asian man’s accent after a phone call 
8989 2018-01-13 18:39:19 this oil change has been the highlight of my day lol
8990 2018-01-13 18:39:18 Спасибо
8991 2018-01-13 18:39:17 @ASAJAALICANTE Hola, soy un periodista con el Olive Oil Times. Estoy escribiendo un articulo sobre el recurso judicial que los agricultores y granjeros van a presentar a la Justicia para que el Consell deje de cortar árboles sanos. Puedo preguntarle a alguien sobre este tema?
8992 2018-01-13 18:39:10 and the solar panels and windmills cannot contain any plastic, since that comes from oil and is obviously part of the problem
8993 2018-01-13 18:39:08 when you include North Korea it has to look bad. Venezuela was doing well until it's oil based economy collapsed. Once global demand dipped, it simply nosedived. It was a bad economic policy. Cuba i have heard has a good functional health and education system.
8994 2018-01-13 18:39:06 I know I’m adulting when I get more excited about getting an oil change than pretty much anything else
8995 2018-01-13 18:39:02 Olives >>>>>> Olive oil

Peanuts >>>>>> Peanut oil

Babies ????? This must be stopped !
8996 2018-01-13 18:38:46 Heard a loud noise downstairs turned out my cat made a mess in the kitchen and was in front of my door covered in frying oil acting all naive so i bathed her despite the cold weather so now i smell like an oily fried chicken. Like bitch its 2am 
8997 2018-01-13 18:38:45 Sometimes every day! I always forget something. Yesterday it was tampons and olive oil, so I’ll hit the store again today.
8998 2018-01-13 18:38:44 All the GOP talking heads are touting the GDP of Norway 
( a stable &growing economy )  there are more people in New York City 
( population of 8.55 million) than the whole country of Norway 
(pop 5.233 million) It is also the world's fifth-largest oil exporter. #msnbc
8999 2018-01-13 18:38:41 aahh i wanted to put the fry pan away and i bumbed into tge washingmachine so the hot oil was on my hand. but it cooled a bit down and it was warmer than my hand.
9000 2018-01-13 18:38:19 #CAgov candidates clash over single-payer health care. @GavinNewsom wants it for California. @antonio4ca & @JohnChiangCA say Newsom lacks plan to pay for it. Villaraigosa says it's "snake oil" without plan.
9001 2018-01-13 18:38:11 From the way @realmadrid is going down, they'll soon discover oil... 
9002 2018-01-13 18:38:07 Yes but if you go in and tell them your allergies they'll hook you up.  Lip scrubs are sugar and salt usually.slewpy does have almond oil.
9003 2018-01-13 18:38:06 ยาสิวที่อยากได้

- ออรินารี่หรือเซรั่มแบรนด์นั้น
- rose hip oil
9004 2018-01-13 18:38:01 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp Sirs, when are you going to take measures to curtail pilferage from oil tankers. 1) Unsafe 2) Dealers demand more commission due to losses 3) Tax payers have to foot the bill of dealers's commission.
9005 2018-01-13 18:37:35 @GodfreyForOH16 The more I look into hemp the more disgusted I get with Congressional bans on growing industrial hemp. A 12oz bottle of hemp oil for your salad dressing will cost you over $100. No other omega 3/6 source costs close to that -- or is healthier to eat.
9006 2018-01-13 18:37:19 That's because Canadian oil producers are so desperate to move their products they're willing to sell it at a loss. Cdn consumers pay for it at the pump
9007 2018-01-13 18:37:09 Got the gas and the splash like an oil spill
9008 2018-01-13 18:37:03 حرفيا صح
9009 2018-01-13 18:36:59 Ternyata aku salah beli  ini ga pure extra virgin olive oil tapi dicampur refined pomace huhuhu..
9010 2018-01-13 18:36:57 It's the classic picture of the snake oil salesman taking in the small rural towns
9011 2018-01-13 18:36:47 With oil prices low, they need to export as much as possible
9012 2018-01-13 18:36:46 I’m so soft right now. Coffee scrub. And coconut oil masks for hair and face
9013 2018-01-13 18:36:46 وياتري الناس دي بتكون فين مشتاقين نعرفهم
9014 2018-01-13 18:36:43 I used to think that of Bakersfield but then I was assured it was an oil & agricultural stronghold. Now I’m just sad and hopeful
9015 2018-01-13 18:36:38 If ONLY the shit hole countries wdv kept their diamonds and gold and oil to themselves we wd have never ever had a trump.
9016 2018-01-13 18:36:28 (that being said, Norway discovered its oil *after* they built their good institutions, which I think made a big difference)
9017 2018-01-13 18:36:09 @One_Angry_Chef If it weren't for crap rags like the Mail et al spouting utter garbage about coconut oil etc and being generally obnoxious the world would quite possibly be a better place. The only good place for coconuts is curry and Bounties.
9018 2018-01-13 18:35:33 เอินเเม่งสุดยอดจริงๆ ยอมใจ หาให้จนได้
9019 2018-01-13 18:35:09 Is this certainty Labour will sell to Scottish voters when they descend for mass recruiting drives of ‘guillable’ Scots?When they come to your door ask when they’ll reinstate  6000 sq miles of Scottish water,5 oil wells & all fishing rights the last Labour Gov stole from us.
9020 2018-01-13 18:35:04 Fuckn scared to sign shit at the dealership man i only went in for an oil change I'm paranoid asf reading every little thing on the page
9021 2018-01-13 18:34:48 Evans covers 8 million losses every season. Who else is going to cover those losses. I didn't hear about a rich oil magnate banging down Sheepshanks door. We'd be in league 2 without evans
9022 2018-01-13 18:34:37 Black humor moves where the fear snake has been,
       it bubbles like hot oil and it releases me ~
9023 2018-01-13 18:34:23 So, I just noticed on a SheaMoisture lotion that they say they use"fragrance (essential oil blend)". There is no way this is all they use for fragrance. No. Way.
9024 2018-01-13 18:34:20 took care of my baby today  all new tires, wheel alignment, oil change, car wash and a full tank she better act right all year lmaooo
9025 2018-01-13 18:34:10 Actually ocean city is the pits, dirty, run-down, low-class shithole. A couple of oil platforms won’t hurt anything.
9026 2018-01-13 18:34:03 I earn 8 pounds 81 an hour do a 5 day week get 6 weeks off a year and im run down as hell...... oh Conte im so sorry ur oil boys are tired if theres anything i can do dont hesitate to call!!!
9027 2018-01-13 18:33:32 So I take it you ordered 2 W's for the Oil, a side order of massive offence  and hookers and blow for McDandy's 21st B'day. Well played
9028 2018-01-13 18:33:25 More an issue of separation.  In oil they'd be floating around.  In the air fryer, they're laying on top each other.  Even with shaking them occasionally, it was still a wad.
9029 2018-01-13 18:33:16 When we talk about energy, we tend to limit the discussion to fossil fuels, whale oil, electricity, coal, etc.  But the truth is, we built our nation and gained our independence on slave power, mined out of Africa and consumed to a large footprint.
9030 2018-01-13 18:33:07 One time I drank a bunch of oil and I got quite the tummy ache, and I also died.
9031 2018-01-13 18:32:49 "umm... ummm..."? Seriously? In such situations they call the person you linked to a "shill for patriarchy/oil/meat industry whtvr" or bombard you with a bunch of scientific articles they have obviously did not read nor had the capacity to understand.
9032 2018-01-13 18:32:20 #BreakingNews  Singapore charges 3 more suspects in Shell refinery oil heist
9033 2018-01-13 18:32:16 These monsters feed on oil, which I think is extremely energy efficient.
9034 2018-01-13 18:32:04 Any less expensive way for a fella to watch the #ChiliBowl tonight less than the $99 Lucas Oil TV fee? #AskingForAME #chilibowl30
9035 2018-01-13 18:32:00 yo decia que los oil pen no hacian nah oh man how wrong i was

9037 2018-01-13 18:31:45 Tribal Voices has the oil but no candles and McKnight's doesn't carry that scent. I'll have to wait for the Amazon delivery.
9038 2018-01-13 18:31:24 がんばってほしい
9039 2018-01-13 18:31:23 They were bought with a go fund me..NRA, pharmaceuticals, oil, Koch, tea party..
9040 2018-01-13 18:31:21 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
9041 2018-01-13 18:31:16 Showed my mom the Glowtion and shimmer oil I got from Bath & Body and she said okaaay you gone be chocolate and shinning girl

9044 2018-01-13 18:30:59 I put on some calming essential oil.
9045 2018-01-13 18:30:55 There's still value on the Habs at +115. I like the Yotes & Oil first frames and Oil +.5 as well. I've been I've cold lately so I wouldn't suggest tailing any of those...
9046 2018-01-13 18:30:54 Tea tree oil works wonders
9047 2018-01-13 18:30:46 @naija927fm With the way Real Madrid dey go down they will soon discover Crude Oil
9048 2018-01-13 18:30:39 You'll recall we were pissed when he attacked Obama on oil and other issues, we know we tread lightly, and work behind scenes even when hated Bush.
9049 2018-01-13 18:30:38 Well you know that is happening. Friends of the Earth was bankrolled and Oil Man and chartered as an anti-nuclear organization.
9050 2018-01-13 18:30:24 igloo should work for you. Next time you fly = oil. Every electric motor = oil, asphalt = oil, plastic = oil, duh
9051 2018-01-13 18:30:19 I’ll bring the oil and forest sounds cd 
9052 2018-01-13 18:30:16 The oil don't move until it finds the person it's supposed to be poured on!

9055 2018-01-13 18:29:36 Add ins optional - 2 tbls pecan pieces or blueberries

Or top on afterwards

I use 1 tbls honey for topping afterwards

I use coconut oil to make pancakes

If batter is thick use 1 tsp unsweetened almond milk to thin out.
9056 2018-01-13 18:29:34 Yes! I used St. Ives: Green Tea Exfoliate, Fresh: Rose Face Mask, & a home made lip scrub - sugar & honey or coconut oil
9057 2018-01-13 18:29:26 Should be watching wizard of oz! Learning how to oil that metal suit! ;)
9058 2018-01-13 18:29:24 Oil prices hasn't been friendly lately.. Y'all should get that plus there's talks of a new stadium (the most expensive they say). Chelsea has that squad depth and resources to compete...
9059 2018-01-13 18:29:22 Let’s see. I have both family and friends still in the oil patch. I did my stint in Ft. Mac, and I tend to keep up on Oil since, y’know, it affects our economy. But maybe I am out of touch?
9060 2018-01-13 18:29:14 Spent a billion pound of oil money in the space of 8 years
9061 2018-01-13 18:29:11 it's not so bad just big oil country which makes it smell like shit lmao
9062 2018-01-13 18:29:10 Massage oil ?
9063 2018-01-13 18:29:08 Pokken has some weird ass looking Pokémon, what you mean??? Why tf Mewtwo covered in fucking oil, you see how shiny this nigga is
9064 2018-01-13 18:29:07 Delving into such in a country like ours may lead to joblessness because the industry is not catered for by our educational institutions, so therefore leading to importation of labour. We are blessed with coal, oil and lots of water which we can use. This is just an exmpl tho
9065 2018-01-13 18:28:59 Added a coconut oil to my night beauty routine that shit feels good u guys
9066 2018-01-13 18:28:58 Norfolk is great for cheese. @ferndalecheeses @BinhamBlue @FenFarmDairy @nortonsdairy Mrs Temples and loads more
9067 2018-01-13 18:28:57 Gold, silver, oil and other commodities are also rising due to weak dollar. And weak dollar is a strategy of currency wars leading by China.
9068 2018-01-13 18:28:46 My African Black Soap ingredients are 

Palm Kernal Oil, Coconut Oil, Stearin Oil, Cocoa Pod Husk, Shea Butter & water.
9069 2018-01-13 18:28:43 Just be careful using it around any pet cats because they lack the ability to metabolize certain compounds in the oil and they can get really sick if they’re exposed to it
9070 2018-01-13 18:28:34 @HolyKock I think khamenei have been far to contolling, treating these people like a puppet, khamenei does not own Iran, he is robbing them blind, they should have resourses from oil revenue! It is the peoples land, not leaders

9076 2018-01-13 18:27:15 The govt then liberialized the telecom sector, same thing they should do with the oil sector now. Stop all this fake subsidy n greed.
9077 2018-01-13 18:26:54 "I'm philosophically for it," Villaraigosa says of single-payer. "Anyone who says we're going to do it without a plan is selling you snake oil." Newsom: "Antonio just mentioned that he's on Medicare. Isn't that interesting. A single-payer plan in this country. That's working."
9078 2018-01-13 18:26:47 Lol now we will pay Sanchez and his agent whatever they want, money over oil 
9079 2018-01-13 18:26:36 Not again: THERE IS NO CURE FOR AUTISM - always thought snake oil pushers had gone down with the Titanic - we understand people are jealous of us because we are not part of the herd - its how it is
9080 2018-01-13 18:26:22 Очень красиво
9081 2018-01-13 18:26:13 And it’s big donor oil money over humanity
9082 2018-01-13 18:26:11 Hey @JeremySimes I am the new city hall reporter for Metro. Just received a VM on the work-phone, turns out you're due for an oil change. Thought you'd want to know. 
9083 2018-01-13 18:26:06 You'll  probably find it is Scottish oil that funds the London Financial Sector.
9084 2018-01-13 18:26:03 Oh yes of course! How about when he comes home to his mother? Or when he flat out saves the workers on the oil rig? Gives me the feels !!! I played the trailer over and over when it first dropped!
9085 2018-01-13 18:26:02 That’s the price to pay for believing the silicon snake oil merchants.. :-/
9086 2018-01-13 18:25:26 How would that Help Edmonton? There season is Finished this year and JJ is a UFA and would either bolt after the season or force The oil in to a over payed contract.
9087 2018-01-13 18:25:18 Who has been thinking about trying CBD oil but still has questions? Comment and I'll be answering throughout the day!

9094 2018-01-13 18:24:42 Went for an oil change and was asked how I get around in my truck. First off, I'm not incompetent. Secondly, girls drive truck too buddy. 
9095 2018-01-13 18:24:40 I hate waiting to get an oil change 
9096 2018-01-13 18:24:24 Impressed with the results of beard oil ...!!!

9101 2018-01-13 18:23:41 i’m at the store getting avocados, coconut oil, coconut milk, and bananas and the cashier is like “weird combo, what are u making?”

uhh a hair mask lol...
9102 2018-01-13 18:23:27 I also believe you are smart and able enough to read and comprehend my tweet and its genesis
9103 2018-01-13 18:23:11 I use a charcoal face wash which helped with my skin overall. I would use tea tree oil for your puppies and vitamin e oil to prevent scarring
9104 2018-01-13 18:23:01 IT'S MOSTLY NOT ABOUT SHALE OIL.
9105 2018-01-13 18:22:54 Why should I listen to the fake congresswoman from CA? She lies and trying to obstruct because she is so dishonest to the American people. @DNC is proud of the snake oil salesman that speaks with both sides on one mouth.
9106 2018-01-13 18:22:51 great waste of Money how many oil fired boilers are in city owned buildings? how much heating oil and gasoline does the city of NY purchase each year? think before you waste our money

9112 2018-01-13 18:21:50 Starl illustration of how differently Norway and the UK have handled the North Sea Oil revenues. 
One wasted, one invested.
9113 2018-01-13 18:21:46 You might as well sue old man winter Bill.
How about NYC get serious about going green. Why don't we find away to make it easier to install solar panels on rooftops?
Give the homeowner a property tax break.
Lawsuit against big oil is just campaigning.
9114 2018-01-13 18:21:45 .@CityPowerJhb any update on power being restored in Kew area???? We have had no electricity since 13h00 today!!!! How much more time will you guys take to source 20000ltrs of oil???
9115 2018-01-13 18:21:40 Hi Kathy, techs are still on site sourcing in the 20 000L oil that leaked from the transformer. There is no confirmed ETR.^HM
9116 2018-01-13 18:21:37 Your labor is black and that oil was probably stolen from African. Don't leave out African people ( including black people.) Because of your prejudices. Good day to you sir
9117 2018-01-13 18:21:35 i truly think coconut oil has magic in it. like why does is work for EVERYTHING? it’s a life changer.

9121 2018-01-13 18:21:12 My morning spent getting an oil change and other services is finished so I can finally tune in to #RapKulture!
9122 2018-01-13 18:21:12 A blatant lie. You neglected to include the energy cost of drilling and refining the oil. Start to finish plastic bags uses 5 times the energy to produce.
9123 2018-01-13 18:21:09 i believe you are smart enough to to know people have their views and choices
9124 2018-01-13 18:20:36 Now playing: 'BEDS ARE BURNING' by 'MIDNIGHT OIL'
9125 2018-01-13 18:20:31 Americans continue to believe snake oil peddlers. Give 'em the old razzle dazzle!

9127 2018-01-13 18:20:12 My hair is just growing. I’m not even using my RejuvaGRO oil.. my baby just growing my hair like crazy. And I still have a month and a half to go before I have her.

9130 2018-01-13 18:19:47 Aveeno Eczema (drugstore) or FAB (First Aid Beauty) Ultra Repair Cream (Sephora and maybe Ulta). Night time I wear white cotton gloves and load hands w/one of the above and sometimes Vaseline or Shea Butter or coconut oil.
9131 2018-01-13 18:19:44 Yes I am sick of this fake out rage . They all are like snake oil salesmen, screaming on the road sides selling their oils
9132 2018-01-13 18:19:42 Yep had to drill out one side on me Dommie 150mm bits cos of access problems. Kept dipping bit in cutting oil and picked threads clean. Always good idea to replace nuts with brass as well other side have to be engine out
9133 2018-01-13 18:19:36 I know a few. I’m gonna learn to change my oil one day

Now many are realizing they've been conned & the base is mostly backward pseudo Xians he'll bent on making America white & rolling back the clock to 1950. Duke represents his base.

9147 2018-01-13 18:18:02 Fish is far more potent than fish oil caps. Salmon/mackerel once a week beats out daily fish oil supplement
9148 2018-01-13 18:17:54 Ask my husband. 
Egg yolk, vegetable oil, mustard, salt & pepper. 

The rule in France is if a lady is on THAT week, she can’t malaxe the mayo as it will curdle.

9152 2018-01-13 18:17:31 @PalmersUK Your coconut oil body lotion makes me smell like I should be on a beach, enjoying the sunshine. Kind of a downer when I look out of my window.
9153 2018-01-13 18:17:23 Getting an oil change, they are playing @FoxNews. I’m ready to claw my eye out.
9154 2018-01-13 18:16:47 An oil change? Let's do that then!
Sorry, I've been busy irl, so that's my fault.
9155 2018-01-13 18:16:36 It is OIL.

9157 2018-01-13 18:16:26 Baby Oil gel is my only friend in these temps. 
9158 2018-01-13 18:16:08 the hysteria surrounding fracking is out of control, it has been ongoing for probably 50 to 55 years it is not new technology, water wells do not draw from oil and gas reservoirs they are hundreds of meters deep probably more total BS arguments
9159 2018-01-13 18:15:58 Flint, MI; Puerto Rico; Anywhere where plocals have had to fight to keep oil pipelines out. This is all just the U.S.
9160 2018-01-13 18:15:57 ...hopefully will hit the Cosmo tonight after the game so I can maybe gamble with some of the Oil!
9161 2018-01-13 18:15:56 You forgot to do a oil change

9166 2018-01-13 18:15:22 Handful of sand in your motor oil? Genetic expression and transcription are at risk.
9167 2018-01-13 18:15:10 Not in your back yard @PhilMurphyNJ ?  You want the Oil and Gas wells elsewhere?  How about you have NJ stop using Oil & Gas...

9169 2018-01-13 18:15:07 The AR125's used to seize for no good reason, Kawasaki used to turn up the 2 stroke pumps to try to stop them seizing and lads were driving around with 2 stroke oil dripping from the exhaust pipe, they would still seize
9170 2018-01-13 18:15:06 Oil Market is bullish

Now crude oil prices are $14/Bbl higher than beginning the fourth quarter 2017 and China looks set to have a huge crude import increase in 2018 to support demand growth, reduced imports of mixed aromatics and LCO, and more SPR buying.
9171 2018-01-13 18:14:45 You are nothing but a huckster, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, and an embarrassment to real Christians everywhere.

9181 2018-01-13 18:12:55 Agreed 100%, and in many cases #extractives-based development simply is not a viable strategy in comparison to other options - almost always the case for any country considering getting into oil, coal, and other sectors from scratch at this point.
9182 2018-01-13 18:12:38 เห้อม
9183 2018-01-13 18:12:33 crude production is consistently up, Draws have been consistent, but what have crude imports been YoY? Crude levels in the US are manipulated so that oil prices continue upward. I think demand is low. Things to consider. : ]
9184 2018-01-13 18:12:33 Seriously?! Big Oil would cease to exist if we didn't support them. If we all switched to non-combustion vehicles, zero plastic, non-petrol-based drugs, etc., etc. Ultimately, the consequences rest on the heads of each and every person that uses the products derived from Big Oil.
9185 2018-01-13 18:12:24 As a journalist, I'd be interested in maybe writing a piece on the KRG/Israel oil deal (which by definition includes Turkey). 
Would you share some valuable info/numbers? 
that'd be great. 
thanks.

9188 2018-01-13 18:12:10 Nigeria and Angola are top 15 oil producers in the continent. Of all the countries in the top 20 they are the only ones who suffer from Oil related deficiencies. They don't have "oil refineries". Oil is sold to the Americans and then resold at a higher price. Ndiyoyo Africa

9190 2018-01-13 18:11:59 Lots of errands done this morning like getting a haircut grocery shopping and getting an oil change for my car!
9191 2018-01-13 18:11:43 @jiffylube might be the DMV of oil change.
9192 2018-01-13 18:11:38 The GOP are gutless human beings to cover for the snake oil salesman Trump dirty mouth

9198 2018-01-13 18:10:58 What about off shore drilling every where but Florida? How about trumps investment in the pipeline? Or his Secretary of State who spent years trying to get an oil deal done with Russia. Go read some facts and learn something.

9212 2018-01-13 18:09:44 We are not from "shithole countries". Rather, we are from countries rich in natural resources such as gold, oil, manganese that fuel the economy of the US. Countries blended with different cultures, languages & filled with the beauty of this world. 

We are from AFRICA!

9223 2018-01-13 18:08:00 Alberta is a beautiful place, maybe look into canadian economics about where all our Alberta oil money goes,
9224 2018-01-13 18:07:59 can you take oregano oil? not a cure but it is anti-viral so it might help (most effective mixed w/ coconut oil/ applied to the soles of the feet but you can also take it as a supplement)
9225 2018-01-13 18:07:53 a secret doomsday cult and big oil went to the prom with THE COWS can i really be the only person who sees this?
9226 2018-01-13 18:07:52 The oil reserves are mostly depleted, but there’s natural gas for 50-100 more years. What to do next is a big debate right now, whether to stay the course or wind down. The ‘stay the course’ camp is winning. For now. The fund will in theory generate $ forever.
9227 2018-01-13 18:07:45 whenever I get oil and put it in my car I always get comments that ppl are impressed I know how to add oil to my car like?? thats a basic car skill....

9229 2018-01-13 18:07:39 One more remedy: 1-2 drops each of frankincense essential oil and oregano essential oil in a capsule and fill with olive or grapeseed oil. Several of those through the day helped cure my strep throat in 2-3 days. And you can never go wrong with garlic.
9230 2018-01-13 18:07:35 HA Ha don't feel bad Once after changing the oil in my car I spent 5 minutes trying to get what i thought was oil on my hands off!! No no oil just Freckles

9233 2018-01-13 18:07:16 Americans need to own that their love affair with oil is what made a lot of these countries uninhabitable. Ask anyone in Mexico, the Sudan, Iraq....

9258 2018-01-13 18:05:09 Actually, Norwegians might very well come here, now that their ocean oil fields are mostly milked, and ours are just now re-opened.

It's what made Norway rich & debt-free.
9259 2018-01-13 18:05:09 Corn tortilla warmed to soften, wrapnit around boiled shredded chicken and queso blanco, and whatever seasoning you want. Then fry, several at a time in an inch or two of oil, flap side down and flip.
9260 2018-01-13 18:05:08 Denmark has the same welfare system, more or less, and we don't have the oil money, you refer to. (mainly because we sort of gave it all to Norway back then, but hey, they kind of deserved it, Denmark was an asshole to Norway if you look at history)
9261 2018-01-13 18:04:52 Put them out! I've sat here and rule. That we shall boil in hot steaming kettle of beezle-nut oil! You can use it for carpets.

But we'll try, look for the drunk oil fan, there shouldn't be too many of us!
9271 2018-01-13 18:03:26 No worries. They can go down under the earth or far at the sea. The coal mines are opening and so do the oil platforms.

But now I have to go examine the outline, which again I fear is bad (etc. You writers know this endless cycle, I'm sure!)

9291 2018-01-13 18:01:45 Time to add "getting an oil change" to the list of adult things I suck at doing in an adulty manner.

9293 2018-01-13 18:01:30 No it wouldn’t.  And if it would get ready because oil is a finite resource. Fossil fuels are not the answer.  They lead to war,greed and destruction of our planet.
9294 2018-01-13 18:01:29 Sir Lawrence would have been happy to supply ol’ J.R. with some sweet financing for a Ewing Oil acquisition; he probably would have even skipped lunch at Le Circus with the well-dressed, heavyset bean counters!

9301 2018-01-13 18:00:24 Oil spills don’t recognize borders. All ocean drilling should be banned.
9302 2018-01-13 18:00:22 works two ways , UK has no state oil , privatised everything to pay the few - so PENSIONERS suffer. Stat OIL , svo wealth fund , only started in the 90s.

9305 2018-01-13 18:00:15 Hey Jeb I guess you are smarter than every scientist not being paid by big oil to refute climate change. Not all of us listen to fox news and drink the cool aid.  What a jackass!
9306 2018-01-13 18:00:01 When you get to your oil change early and think "oh they'll get it done early because no one is here" but they just sit around until your appointed time. Could've just went in and got it out of the way. Oh well.
9307 2018-01-13 17:59:54 If Nigeria didn't have any oil it would also be a shithole. Do you know how many middle eastern countries ban Nigerians? Nothing but trouble.

9310 2018-01-13 17:59:16 Why would an Xpresident yell citizen because they listen to FOX NEWS they are from another planet ( aliens ) Obama rips Fox News viewers: ‘You are living on a different planet’ Does Obama think he is kicking ass  now. As he once said regarding BP oil.
9311 2018-01-13 17:59:03 Loved this weeks episode with the jags.  As a mechanic i say jags leak more oil than the damn bp oil crisis, but they are fun to drive.
So much fun I patiently waited through celebrity interview.

9313 2018-01-13 17:58:57 Probably because you guys aren’t attacking our oil producers enough and telling us we’re the ones responsible for all this when in reality we’re not. They need you to engage in their smear campaign while they get funding from the Tides foundation to destroy our energy sector.

9317 2018-01-13 17:58:45 Congratulations team Indian Oil
9318 2018-01-13 17:58:43 Snake Oil Salesman.
9319 2018-01-13 17:58:39 remembering my great-uncle who worked at the haifa oil refinery & was there on that day it was attacked by the irgun killing 6 palestinians ... on dec 30 1947 ... about 70 years ago
9320 2018-01-13 17:58:37 I do understand that reasoning, but it was determined already that there is not enough oil here on the West Coast to warrant the risks. We need to push harder for alternatives.
9321 2018-01-13 17:58:30 Sorry for having to point out the obvious C, Norway has a state oil company and the last time i checked, the SNP aren't proposing a state oil company. Go on, have another go.
9322 2018-01-13 17:58:27 ...NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT ....BUT YOUR A SNALE OIL SALESMAN ...A MONEY LAUNDERER...WOMANIZER AND SELF PROFESSED BRAGGART ABOUT IT...PADDING YOUR POCKETS RIGHT NOW ...

9325 2018-01-13 17:58:16 They want globalism we want individual societies that live in peace. Oil and water don’t mix no matter how you shake it up.
9326 2018-01-13 17:58:01 What's the plan for the future when the oil reserves are depleted?
9327 2018-01-13 17:58:01 This is an actual fear of mine. I always proceed with caution when getting quick oil changes
9328 2018-01-13 17:57:52 Curtis, please terminate yourself from Eli Lilly’s payroll and approve HEMP derived CBD oil.
9329 2018-01-13 17:57:51 Why when you get an oil change they try to sell you a million different things you don’t need?
9330 2018-01-13 17:57:45 So hard to choose just 1! I will go w/ rapini - steamed lightly then sauteed in coconut oil and lots of garlic

9340 2018-01-13 17:56:30 It’s official. The #USA,russian& UK(wikileaks),oil companies backing #Trump for rolling out their USA poor/midclass & environmentally”unfriendly”agenda; are using race wedge-issue weapons spearheaded by Trump rhetoric on full display recently @ a congressional #DACA meeting. #CNN
9341 2018-01-13 17:56:26 Trump is nothing more than a criminal con artist, snake oil salesman. It's really hard for me to understand how the people who voted for him did not see through the bullshit, and equally as hard to forgive them for that.

9351 2018-01-13 17:54:46 It doesn’t change the fact I pay my tax yet I pay an over inflated Electricity bill, the bad roads keeps ruining the shocks of my vehicle, police harass me instead of protecting me, fuel is gold n I heard we produce crude oil! It’s indeed a shithole biko.
9352 2018-01-13 17:54:40 got the cutest lil tub of travel coconut oil for work too
9353 2018-01-13 17:54:35 Isn't byproduct of low oil prices. Is the: slow, debatable, hypocrite(folks will consider it up to their ideological, religious, etc preferences)outcome of a plan targeting wide societal transformation. In an interconnected world U-as society- cant go forev with deep conservatism
9354 2018-01-13 17:54:29 12086 Shatabdi exp and Rajdhani exp should stopped at Simaluguri jn, Namrup, Duliajan for the employees working at ONGC, OIL, GAIL, Assam Petrochemicals, AGCL and other PSUs of Central Govt and State Govt. @rgohainbjp @PiyushGoyal
9355 2018-01-13 17:54:21 Yes (for the expansion) - that’s the problem...it eventually over-obligates the states. “Traditional Mcaid” is a % State and Fed, due to recent Per Capita income levels (why LA got hurt by temp workers ($) during hurricane and oil clean-up)

9361 2018-01-13 17:53:31 Yes. Nigeria is a rich country, with oil and a prosperous middle-class (they have also nigerian soap operas on tv). But the 43% of a small group of in igrants stemming from a middle-class can't be compare to the 33% of a vreat slice of us population. This is statistical nonsense
9362 2018-01-13 17:53:29 Stupid oligarch gonna buy her way in with that oil money, huh?
9363 2018-01-13 17:53:23 Bakersfield Californian, 12/12/17: "Villaraigosa was critical of the sharp increase in costs to middle- and low-income people that was created by the passage of the road tax...Villaraigosa said he won’t be a governor who demonizes the oil and gas sector." #FactCheck #USC #ABC7

9382 2018-01-13 17:51:10 Energy independence is a myth in a global economy. If you doubt this look at Norway or Canada. Both have been "independent" for years but their oil/gas prices still change with global markets.
9383 2018-01-13 17:51:07 Morata's hair was full with oil. maybe he wanted to lubricate it to make his head start functioning.

Many variables, of course, but K2 was in there.
9394 2018-01-13 17:49:47 If he wants energy dominance and energy independence he better start shifting his thinking  to green energy and move with the times instead of putting the future of America at stake destroying everything to pin it all on a finite and harmful source such as oil .

9400 2018-01-13 17:48:02 My pastor grandpa had a name for guys like @pastormarkburns snake oil salesmen who preaches from the pulpit to get rich off his flock! They get rich using those who are poor & believe in God! But one day the holy spirit will kick his fat lazy lying ass all the way to hell! AMEN!
9401 2018-01-13 17:48:01 Baghdad has three conditions to normalize its ties with KRG including oil, airports & border crossings. Iraqi deputy of speaker of Parliament says
9402 2018-01-13 17:47:58 I don't really know who you are, but I work at a cold pressed juice shop and we sell CPD oil there. People come in all the time and tell me they give their dogs CPD oil and it's making them puppies again. So yes, I would definitely suggest what @jessemeoww said!!!

OIL is reason!
9406 2018-01-13 17:47:08 Rubbish. It’s not even digital natural gas. But if you want to sell your oil for $XRP, you can do that.
9407 2018-01-13 17:46:55 Will the council please ban oil drilling in LA? How can you sue oil companies over something we allow to happen in our city?
9408 2018-01-13 17:46:52 Sometimes ALLLLLLL hair needs a lil oil. She needs her ass beat.
9409 2018-01-13 17:46:44 If #NewYork &other #SanctuaryCities R so opposed2 Oil &Gas, wouldnt it make sense 2STOP SUPPLYING OIL &GAS 2them?

9410 2018-01-13 17:46:30 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.
9411 2018-01-13 17:46:29 We have a spacious laundry room that quickly became the catch all room. Boxes of stuff from 2 moves, toys, baby stuff, old small appliances...then there’s the big farm sink. Covered in grease & oil bc that’s his 1st stop from the garage. He poked his head in, went to fold laundry
9412 2018-01-13 17:46:27 The diffuser and sleeping aid aroma oil I used last night,,,,,,holycow, like if I had gotten to bed a little sooner I’d be feeling even better, but I already feel so good
9413 2018-01-13 17:46:21 Oh bless him. One of Mr S's childhood cats fell in oil on the farm too. Not easy to clean off at all.  Hope he's ok and avoids barrels in future!!

9418 2018-01-13 17:45:57 Is that the Norway that gained independence from Sweden?
The Norway that ran a nationalised oil industry to build an Oil Fund for the good of the people?
The Norway where tax dodging is difficult, illegal & socially unacceptable?
Or is there another more Tory Norway somewhere ?
9419 2018-01-13 17:45:57 Try not to use products that dry out ur face bc ur skin will overproduce unnecessary oils & you’ll break out even more. Instead apply oils such as rosehip oil, tamanu oil,etc. Also, use a vitamin c or hyaluronic acid serum to help w/ the fading of scars & pls DON’T POP UR PIMPLES
9420 2018-01-13 17:45:48 Had my oil changed @Walmart yesterday & they didn't reset "change oil" warning light. New warning lights now on. Took it back to check and manager told my husband "not our problem." Seriously?

9427 2018-01-13 17:45:08 Coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear are all part of a strategy for energy independence. Solar and wind supplements our energy needs, but isn't as reliable as boiling water. Everything needs of be on the table for energy independence.

9437 2018-01-13 17:44:17 The Saudis who pay for the mosques would not want them to be together, its not what they are aiming for, they need to get somewhere before the oil runs out, then they will become extinct.
9438 2018-01-13 17:44:16 What a coincidence. I bought some of Sting's special aromatic oil, good for aches and strains, you could say, It's a Massage in a Bottle.

9441 2018-01-13 17:44:03 Of course now that corporations are getting huge tax cuts it’s all going to get better right? Like the subsidies that oil companies get due to programs republicans put in place. We have to financially support the richest corporations in the world.
9442 2018-01-13 17:43:54 The pace at which @realmadrid is going down,we might discover oil very soon.

9450 2018-01-13 17:42:53 2/2 It took a foresighted ruling party to not plug the oil money straight into the budget but instead reinvest all the first decade’s profits into developing our own oil industry. Government matters.
9451 2018-01-13 17:42:52 I think I use coconut oil for everything 
9452 2018-01-13 17:42:39 FACT: In India a man can burn his adult wife to death. To marry a crying 9yr old! 
FACT: In Sask when oil work brought India decent workers white young girls started going missing. FACT: In india everyone gets raped. Babies children women men animals. FACT: Degenerate culture
9453 2018-01-13 17:42:33 Maybe last year was a positive anomaly.....but I saw two #1 studs on the Oil blueline last night, and a strong punishing D who was activating & moving puck well too. But it was the young Yotes, and not a contender.

9460 2018-01-13 17:41:42 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
9461 2018-01-13 17:41:36 AT&T merger with Time Warner should be  "NO BRAINER" in Anti-Trust Court via less Competition but Federal Judges seam to be leaning in favor of less Competition & more Corporate profits/Trump ADMINISTRATION posturing! Oil Companies get more attention than Media Corporations!
9462 2018-01-13 17:41:35 Also, there was way too much olive oil used by Nigel to finish it off.
9463 2018-01-13 17:41:31 Where do you think the pullback gets to before up again?

9480 2018-01-13 17:40:05 Clean energy is the way to go for the environment and jobs.The government spends too much money subsidizing coal and oil allowing for huge profits to a select few.
9481 2018-01-13 17:40:03 Fab! And I love Onion Rings.. 
9482 2018-01-13 17:39:37 Like gas, oil change, brake and tire maintenance to get you your food?
9483 2018-01-13 17:39:31 The problem with that is that we would find few if any GOP who would stand with them, so If all Dems boycott, Trump would get a standing ovation if he recited the freaking phone book....I wish we could empty the place, but it's not likely
9484 2018-01-13 17:39:24 That's not a bad country, that's a communist paradise..well except the murder rate, no food, no electricity, hyperinflation, corrupt communist government and raw sewage running down the streets of Carcus and airports airlines won't fly into..and yet they have billions in oil!!

9486 2018-01-13 17:39:12 1/2 Thanks. It took more than the population though. It took foresighted politicians to agree to never play politics with the oil wealth, which still holds after 50 years.
9487 2018-01-13 17:38:57 You do not speak for all of us.. a lot of us is sick of spending an arm and a leg for blood money oil.
9488 2018-01-13 17:38:49 "JESUS HEALS!!! GET YOUR FREE HOLY OIL (Free Shipping) TODAY! COST YOU  NOTHING! Help The NOW Television Network HEAL the SICK by spreading this  message!"
...or so the NOW Facebook post proclaims. You will be on their mailing list FOR LIFE.
9489 2018-01-13 17:38:49 I agree. The clouds from the oil power station provide shade from the hot late sun.

9499 2018-01-13 17:37:21 So you don't think it's possible that billionaire oil empires and banking cartels would maybe...just maybe...want to influence government?

9501 2018-01-13 17:37:11 How crazy is it that I managed to google how to put out an oil fire in the heat of the moment and it came tf through. What a time to be alive.
9502 2018-01-13 17:37:05 Master of Spin and a Snake Oil Salesman. Even better, this is the equivalent of the guys in NYC on the streets with the Shell Games. That is the perfect description of DJT's MO
9503 2018-01-13 17:36:58 Love oil pastels and kids mixed together.
9504 2018-01-13 17:36:51 Looks like I'll be doing hot oil treatments WEEKLY until this weather lets up. Below freezing temps on a daily basis is murder on the skin and hair 
9505 2018-01-13 17:36:51 @ffweekend The government needs to cut off their food supplies and they’re all oil supplies to Russia and tell them to keep their nose out of our business of the Internet
9506 2018-01-13 17:36:49 With the way Real Madrid are going down, they will soon discover oil.....Lol

9516 2018-01-13 17:35:24 If you put oil prices on par with an actual physical invasion of your homeland, sure.

9523 2018-01-13 17:35:10 They should with hold their natural resources.After all, who would wear shit hole diamonds, use shit hole oil or minerals, etc. Africa 1st maybe a good motto.
9524 2018-01-13 17:34:52 Best stats in the league as a winger 
9525 2018-01-13 17:34:47 No, it's a point of view that doesn't assume oil is a national security issue.
9526 2018-01-13 17:34:46 The rose oil is the one I would go for as my wife loves. Fingers crossed!

9528 2018-01-13 17:34:40 #Hahamadrid will soon discover oil.
9529 2018-01-13 17:34:35 Difference is that the Norwegian government has a stake in the majority oil and gas fields, unlike UK, hence why it has the fund, are you proposing nationalising the fields?
9530 2018-01-13 17:34:34 @VintTrader I have been building a oil co. in Israel and a gold mine in Arizona. we should try to speak. all the best  Baruch.

9537 2018-01-13 17:33:56 Learn from history @realDonaldTrump. Many, many years ago, Norway was really poor and if you existed in that time you would have considered it a shithole because of its economic standing. Luckily, Norway discovered oil around 1969, pure luck & a blessing that made them rich.
9538 2018-01-13 17:33:56 "wait, the gold rush. was that the one with gold or oil?" 
@AlexStoffregen is drunk at 11am
9539 2018-01-13 17:33:44 Thieves is not an inappropriate description given that Thatcher used the money from North sea oil to defeat the miners and to fund the unemployment that this caused.

I hated Thatcher by the way and I am not afraid to admit it.
9540 2018-01-13 17:33:35 Someone said the world will never run dry of oil as long as they keep draining it from Alvaro Morata's hair. 

Striker he de use Styling Gel. What twat 
9541 2018-01-13 17:33:29 نيتروجينا نوعين تاكد تأخذ gel مو oil free لان مره قوي ع البشره 
9542 2018-01-13 17:33:23 I'm too lazy to apply coconut oil on my hair today.
9543 2018-01-13 17:33:20 today's method of self-sabotage was baking with coconut oil in a frigid scottish kitchen
9544 2018-01-13 17:33:17 maybe all that oil drilling is changing your climate?  Just saying
9545 2018-01-13 17:33:05 You folks are so naive,  what would a world without oil look like, forget that laptop or iPhone,  that couch your sitting on,  that coffee maker,  heating the house, fertilizer,  medicines, a way to get to work. Live a life without oil/gas and those products then we'll talk.
9546 2018-01-13 17:32:55 @roelperez5  is the one with oil field cash 
9547 2018-01-13 17:32:53 I put jojoba oil in my hair yesterday and I’ve washed it twice and i can’t get it out so now I’m a permanent grease ball..

Sweet
9548 2018-01-13 17:32:51 Ethereum is not crude oil. If you have crude oil production but prefer Ethereum, I’ll get you a buyer who will pay you in Ethereum. Who is prepared to make that trade?

9551 2018-01-13 17:32:24 А мне очень даже нравится
Красиво
9552 2018-01-13 17:32:20 Tips from our Wine Whisperer ~ fruit, floral, vegetal, spice, and oil are the "big 5" flavor components present in premium wine.
9553 2018-01-13 17:32:18 I love when obscure companies get endorsements from sports teams. It’ll be like “Halliburton: the official oil company of the Georgia Bulldogs” Or “Koch: the official multinational conglomerate of University of Georgia Athletics”
9554 2018-01-13 17:32:04 Shampoo, conditioner, cold pressed castor oil on my tips, air dry, looks amazing
9555 2018-01-13 17:32:02 not sure of  the relationship to Moon Rocks ....Moon Rocks (i been complaining for years about the juvenility of names my opinion) Moon Rocks is freeze dried pot oil rolled in the best/ most potent  part of the organic material
9556 2018-01-13 17:32:01 So I finish getting ready and my mum says I should put this oil in my hair as makes it look pretty n shiny NO IT DOES NOT look like someone has wiped a greasy piece of pizza on my head and now having to re shower re makeup re dry hair and I’m angry !!!!!!!!&8.9/@9/@2@
9557 2018-01-13 17:31:57 A businessman. That's rich. He's a failed businessman. He is a snake oil salesman and a charlatan and anybody that follows him will be remembered.
9558 2018-01-13 17:31:52 I have been away from tweeting for a long time. i have butlt an oil exploration and gold co..tweet me to know more
9559 2018-01-13 17:31:43 Gettinf a quick fix on the car one step atta time to make it better
Gonna need an oil change soon.
9560 2018-01-13 17:31:24 аааааееееее еще бы это прекрасное лицо видеть
9561 2018-01-13 17:31:21 TITULATES
(Desde hoy sábado OIL Combustibles aumenta un 6% sus naftas) 
Ufff menos mal, es igual que el mes pasado, después dicen que hay inflación.
9562 2018-01-13 17:31:17 As an Albertan employed in the oil patch, this is becoming personal Bill. It's OK though, we will continue to supply a valuable resource that even YOU rely on ever day. Your hypocrisy is stunning!
9563 2018-01-13 17:31:14 Oil is their main resource and it is hypocritical of them to talk about climate change and reap the benefits of fossil fuels.  Until recently they did not have to "deal" with the problems that diversity can cause - have a small population-easier to "control"
9564 2018-01-13 17:31:01 "Love cannot endure indifference It needs to be wanted Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low"
9565 2018-01-13 17:31:00 On a side note, it would be really awesome to have my DA photo to actually be an oil painting.
9566 2018-01-13 17:30:58 Oil paintings wooow
9567 2018-01-13 17:30:45 There is no understanding as to why people are not seeing Trump for who he is. The  oil salesman will always be the  oil salesman. The venom Trump spews will eventually penetrate through their minds and bodies. Ignorance is NOT bliss!!!
9568 2018-01-13 17:30:29 That being said, it’s literally cheaper for me to get my oil changed at the dealership than to do it myself with the same materials haha
9569 2018-01-13 17:30:23 Yes Lavender is supposed to be good I know it is a popular oil, I have only a superficial knowledge of this subject, but the effects of these oils on the body and mind is intriguing 
9570 2018-01-13 17:30:15 For the way real madrid are going down , they ll soon discover oil @Prince_dangote
9571 2018-01-13 17:30:10 I need more beard oil and a new comb
9572 2018-01-13 17:29:51 Or, say in Oregon where oil re-refiners have burned (dirty) PCB laden oil for fuel, used no emission controls, and pumped tons of toxic pollutants (really bad shit) into the air shed.
9573 2018-01-13 17:29:49 I mean, if Mexico and the US had a dispute over oil And, say, Russia decided to invade us, we wouldn't call that defensive on Russia's part.
9574 2018-01-13 17:29:48 You clearly didn’t read the article. It’s oil on her wrists and drops under her tongue - not blazing a doobie at recess. If it’s prescribed by a dr, it should be treated in the same way as any other controlled med administered at school under dr’s orders.
9575 2018-01-13 17:29:37 I was planning on relaxing today until I forgot I had an appointment to get an oil change 
9576 2018-01-13 17:29:28 อยากจะบ้าเท้าเส้นยึดเดินไม่ได้เลย
9577 2018-01-13 17:29:26 so the point ...if you got a brain  tumor ....not trying to sell snake oil   not even sure the science ....as far as testing if terminal patients start living um i think the science speaks for itself
9578 2018-01-13 17:29:25 Where Y’all Go To Get Y’all oil Changed ??
9579 2018-01-13 17:29:14 I’ll gladly be the lunatic to help facilitate selling oil and/or natural gas production for Bitcoin. Who is in?
9580 2018-01-13 17:29:10 To Norway’s credit, look at how they dealt with their great oil and gas wealth compared to say, Nigeria, a country with great oil wealth as well
9581 2018-01-13 17:29:05 มันคงเป็นอีกวัน
9582 2018-01-13 17:29:02 was gonna get my nails done today but i dont feel like sitting in anyone’s salon for an hr and a half. lemme get this oil change & go home
9583 2018-01-13 17:28:48 The Governments of the counties the President describes as sh*tholes,are some of the most corruptin the some of the African Nations sell oil on the black market and keep the money while there children are starving.Haiti has no management to provide protection for their people.
9584 2018-01-13 17:28:37 Ok, back to grown folks business. Does anyone know about cars? I’m having problems with my car and went to go remove the spark plug. It was covered with oil. My question is what should I do?
9585 2018-01-13 17:28:36 Kuwait was slant drilling into Iraq's oil fields.
9586 2018-01-13 17:28:32 It's getting cold out, don't forget to add antifreeze to your gas, oil, windshield wiper and blinker fluid. You don't want your car to break
9587 2018-01-13 17:28:09 fuck!!!!! i cant use my decongesting oil anymore. i can however, still use my lavender oil.
9588 2018-01-13 17:27:55 The oil in Morata's hair was a lucid where-i-want-the-pass message to his team mates.
9589 2018-01-13 17:27:48 тв такая красивая
9590 2018-01-13 17:27:48 the catch? the pot oil distills down at about 12 to 1 depending on the guy making it ....10 12 grams to make on gram of oil
9591 2018-01-13 17:27:26 If there is a drop of oil these criminals will destroy anything in there way too greedy profits!
9592 2018-01-13 17:27:11 Agreed brother there’s just no alternative right now that as economically efficient as oil,hopefully soon
9593 2018-01-13 17:27:05 Yeah was holding that crap for a long time and know what I was invested in, with all the naysayers who had no clue. Told Sunny early last year we will end up with 60 oil and possibly 65 if momentum happens, I may see if i can buy a dip may look at PMO
9594 2018-01-13 17:27:04 Killing thousands because oil might rise in price isn't defensive.
9595 2018-01-13 17:26:59 Hina har kam perfecf karti hai , chahe wo first time hi q na ho , not like shilpa extra oil daal kar khana pakati hai , tap water se khana hi nhi pakaya even wo tap water ka pani tak pi jati thi itni unhygienic hai Shilpa

UNHYGIENIC SHILPA SHINDE ....
9596 2018-01-13 17:26:54 Love their Squalane oil
9597 2018-01-13 17:26:50 Me too like another championship
9598 2018-01-13 17:26:43 Pretty sure you can watch for free on the Lucas oil racing app. Then chrome it to your TV
9599 2018-01-13 17:26:27 omg nooooooo Im about to take my car for an oil change and I only have 6% battery life 
9600 2018-01-13 17:26:22 After being in this part of the world for almost all of my life, it's still incredibly surreal and devastating to read headlines like these. I know change is imminent,even if it's a byproduct of low oil prices as people speculate,whatever the fuck it is,it feels so personal
9601 2018-01-13 17:26:20 He really tryna give me this castor oil.
9602 2018-01-13 17:26:12 He was last year's Klef again.  Either couple days in sun helped him heel. Or he reacted to Bob Mackenzie calling him and Lars out, falling from legit #1 pair last yr to something must less, as major part of yr on yr Oil decline (with Cam falling from Vez level season the other)
9603 2018-01-13 17:26:10 Of course because the tax they were required to pay for oil spills was completely repealed. All those pesky safety regulations are rolled back as well. So guess who pays? The taxpayers do and now with 49 states at risk what could possibly go wrong.
9604 2018-01-13 17:25:50 I like it for that reason it's a skincare brand so it's going to hydrate instead of a layer of oil
9605 2018-01-13 17:25:50 Before using a @stjohnambulance vehicle we always do a vehicle daily inspection, or VDI. I use POWDER to help me remember:

Power (fuel level)
Oil (check level)
Water (all engine fluid levels)
Damage
Electrics (incl lights, blue lights + siren)
Rubber (wipers + tyres)

9612 2018-01-13 17:25:29 The way Madrid is going down now, they may soon discovered crude oil
9613 2018-01-13 17:25:29 Seems ridiculous this also doesn't mention oil as a reason Norway was put on the path to the prosperity it has now.
9614 2018-01-13 17:25:08 Baby tip: If your baby has cradle cap try rubbing baby oil on the area
9615 2018-01-13 17:25:04 OPEC bawo? U people shld at least have d fear of God nowRT @kennagq: With the amount of oil in Morata's hair , he can join OPEC
9616 2018-01-13 17:24:56 Check the oil level too.  I have to wonder if they have full fleet maintenance services or just the guy who moves them around on the lot.
9617 2018-01-13 17:24:42 The way Madrid is going down now, they may soon discovered crude oil.
9618 2018-01-13 17:24:39 Meanwhile Sunderland are getting relegated further again...by 2020 they will be touching oil
9619 2018-01-13 17:24:37 real fans bitch and moan even when they win European cups ,he'll get sacked ,PSg and city will emerge as the main clubs because of oil money pumped into them and lack of financial fair play rule enforcement,zi zu will have to get a reputation by being successful with other clubs
9620 2018-01-13 17:24:37 แบบพักไม่ได้เด้อ 555555
9621 2018-01-13 17:24:23 I just got my car not even a month ago and it’s already needing an oil change? sis
9622 2018-01-13 17:24:09 Is this the kind of person we want more of in the US? Sane people don't. But insane Democrats do. Time to demolish the party of loons.
9623 2018-01-13 17:24:06 The best thing about tamil music channels at this part of the day is that they play some beautiful 90s songs which turns you #nostalgic and also help you burn the midnight oil rather enthusiastically #work
9624 2018-01-13 17:24:03 But the oil industry is heavily regulated and risk would be at a minimum. Oh wait! I live in New Orleans. I must have had a temporary memory lapse. BP Horizon happened even with regulations.
9625 2018-01-13 17:24:02 รู้สึกเพลียกว่าปั่นงานแม่ตรีจนไม่ได้นอน 5555
9626 2018-01-13 17:23:59 Just finished smearing coconut oil all over my hair and applying 2 Biore strips. Mechanic calls, says he accidentally left an unused caliper in the backseat, can I run outside to check right now, he needs it.

Uh, sure thing...
9627 2018-01-13 17:23:46 Go watch the BMS oil change episode and tell me your life isn't changed for the worse
9628 2018-01-13 17:23:38 I didn’t spend all that money on coconut oil,ori and all the other natural hair goodies to have y’all disrespect my beloved mane,it’d be your own niggas sha
9629 2018-01-13 17:23:33 I thought motor oil turned to molasses at that temperature.
9630 2018-01-13 17:23:31 Your welcome @mccartanmn45. It's an honor to follow a fellow patriot.
9631 2018-01-13 17:23:31 Just bought cod liver oil and multivitamins so I am now officially an old man.
9632 2018-01-13 17:23:26 Came to get my oil changed and the dealership is having a BBQ for the customers, adulting is fun
9633 2018-01-13 17:23:15 $70..will be interesting to check the oil prices assumptions for the forthcoming budget @FinMinIndia
9634 2018-01-13 17:23:11 //ตบบ่า พอกัน 555555
9635 2018-01-13 17:23:06 I’ve never had an actually attainable dream job, so at 28 I still change my mind based on the latest movie I watched. I watched Deepwater Horizon and now I desperately want to work on an oil rig.
9636 2018-01-13 17:23:04 Thanks, Bill! But NYC is so dependent on fracked nat gas, driving Eastern System Upgrade pipeline expansion all thru NY. Millennium from southern tier to Orange County has really sacrificed the residents. I hope the schools, as they shift from oil burners, researches heat pumps.
9637 2018-01-13 17:22:58 I'd worry more about filling your stadium first coz the oil money will run out soon enough 
9638 2018-01-13 17:22:55 @KathleenLights1 where do you get the marula oil you mentioned in your favorites video?! I searched it online and can’t find it
9639 2018-01-13 17:22:50 TODAY IS THE DAY TO LOVE YA SELF. PUT THAT FACE MASK ON AND HAIR MASH RUB THAT COCONUT OIL ALL OVER YOUR BODY GET YA NAILS DONE CAUSE YOUUUUUU DESERVEEEEEEE ITTTTT
9640 2018-01-13 17:22:39 I just tried to read the fine print of my roll on essential oil and whispered /I need my glasses/ ITS ALREADY STARTING I HATW THIS

9649 2018-01-13 17:21:08 Good question why isn't the US government in the oil business itself rather than buy from the private sector all government vehicles should be running on government oil cut out the middleman
9650 2018-01-13 17:20:56 Maybe if the west didn't spend most of the 20th century destabilizing the middle-east and declaring their superiority we wouldn't be facing these problems. It's a bit late to do much about it now. Cutting down the trade of oil and weapons might be a good start.
9651 2018-01-13 17:20:52 Get coffee, have the oil changed and car washed, get back in bed
9652 2018-01-13 17:20:43 In the last few years only. Previously we paid MORE. Scottish economy improving.
Stop this garbage about Scotland being a basket-case. WM would NEVER keep us if that were the case.
Of course there’s the oil, the water, the renewables, the land.....

9655 2018-01-13 17:20:19 I had a neighbor who poured motor oil all over my other neighbor’s car just because he parked in front of his house 
9656 2018-01-13 17:20:18 but something about that chick with the dreads and doc martins makes me think that european group must stink like body odor and patchouli oil

9660 2018-01-13 17:19:40 Of course, the Oil have the additional problem on top of not playing their young players in the A enough (changing now), they don’t see enough ice when they come up. Hi Sleppy!
9661 2018-01-13 17:19:35 You use the oil as a lip moisturizer?!?!?!?
9662 2018-01-13 17:19:33 So #TrustMeImADoctor did a study on coconut oil and possible health benefits, yet the 100 volunteers for the test were not a diverse enough set of population - I certainly didn't spot a single non-white British test subject there in the group.
9663 2018-01-13 17:19:22 The way Madrid is going down, am sure soon we'll discover oil.

9670 2018-01-13 17:18:08 The credit goes to Putin, the Mercers, and Cambridge Analytica. Sorry, Trump's a recognized ignoramous unless he's selling lies and snake oil. Which apparently extreme right wing is addicted to.
9671 2018-01-13 17:18:03 Needed a battery to consume the oil of a cannabis plant, my apologies.
9672 2018-01-13 17:17:56 I am talking about treatments, as in Aromatherapy treatments - massage mostly - anywhere you would apply the oil to the skin.  However, all essential oils, apart from Lavender must be applied with carrier oil, which would be something like Sweet Almond, Calendula, Camellia, etc.

9682 2018-01-13 17:15:48 I tried oil pulling today for the very first time this morning and I can't wait to do it more often 
9683 2018-01-13 17:15:36 @Lucas_Oil
9684 2018-01-13 17:15:26 Natural gas captured fro the top of Oil deposits is a totally different thing. usually burnt off, injecting toxins into the ground to squeeze out rocks is not profitable unless you are counting on subsidies.
9685 2018-01-13 17:15:20 No she defo siding with him and Jeremy corbyn would never side with a racist like him and Jeremy condemn both side of the venezuela  and venezuela as the most oil in the world but the usa have sanctioned them but now there doing deal with China and Russia you see them boom
9686 2018-01-13 17:15:19 Then came oil.
9687 2018-01-13 17:15:18 Here is a polite request to all those environmentalists that hate oil: PLEASE STOP USING THE STUFF NOW!
9688 2018-01-13 17:15:12 strong man said “let’s steal their oil” and they cheered him on 
strong man said “let’s scorch the soil of the children” 
what’s wrong man - why you celebrate the talk of war crimes? 
i don’t belong man - i’m not a fan of barrel bombs and land mines

9689 2018-01-13 17:15:09 The Seren olive oil bottle will raise 600 Soliders. You have smell dust and fingers.
9690 2018-01-13 17:15:08 Interesting that the disconnect started in 1973 the first oil price shock.
9691 2018-01-13 17:15:03 Have any peppermint essential oil left? Put some on your temples!
9692 2018-01-13 17:15:00 just a lil fun fact that lavender essential oil is one of the only ones that is actually good for cats, it helps calm them down, i put it on the bottom of my cats paws before taking him to the vet!
9693 2018-01-13 17:14:50 Heartbreaking that incompetent DT/Pruitt have already hurt our beautiful world!! Sierra Club/ conservationist groups need to become leaders for country and get loud and fight back!!!! Oil rigs everywhere? Really? Ma gov Baker(GOP) tttoooo quiet!! Protect beaches!!
9694 2018-01-13 17:14:48 (Just trust me) borage seed oil from amazon or Walmart will help promote and expedite healing!! I just got mine done in November and its definitely helped
9695 2018-01-13 17:14:46 Nope
9696 2018-01-13 17:14:37 Most importantly:

We became energy DOMINATE, not independent but DOMINATE in less than a year. Oil, coal and LNG. We are actually EXPORTING natural resources, not importing. Every $1 we export instead of import add $2 to the GDP, hence almost 4%.
9697 2018-01-13 17:14:33 I feel like the oil change guys secretly judged me for my lack of oil changing.
9698 2018-01-13 17:14:30 1. They make electric and hybrid suvs, you know.    2. It’s wasteful to get rid of the car you have and replace it. It takes a LOT of oil to manufacture and transport a new car.
9699 2018-01-13 17:14:28 DT you’re no better than a medicine man selling snake oil. In time your “make America great again” sales pitch will fall apart and Americans and America will pay a hard price. America please don’t buy in to this “Medicine man”. Get out the vote.

9701 2018-01-13 17:14:24 $PETRO, Venezuelan "Crypocurrency" can NOT be mined, but the state will assign it by social auctions ... That is, it is NOT a cryptocurrency, there is NO blockchain. It is a debt bond issue based on oil resources even in the subsoil.
9702 2018-01-13 17:14:20 Epsom salt, Ecualyptus oil, bath bomb, warm water, poetry book, & a glass of lemon water w/ theives & oregano = my morning

9704 2018-01-13 17:13:43 I came to do an oil change on my car and there’s some dude spending MONEY on his truck lol I barely wanted to pay 50 bucks
9705 2018-01-13 17:13:36 Hemp seeds/oil is one of the healthiest supplements you can add to your diet. They contain essential nutrients most of us are not getting in food. Yet because the law lumps hemp and marijuana together, there's almost NO industrial hemp in the USA, skyrocketing prices needlessly.

9712 2018-01-13 17:12:49 We need to ween off of oil not step up it's production.  China is the leader in renewable energy.  We need to follow their lead.

9726 2018-01-13 17:11:15 don't get me wrong. I love showers and hot oil treatments and 9 hr naps as much as the next depressive type. but bailing on friends, esp those with their own disabilities and esp to indulge yourself, is a dick move
9727 2018-01-13 17:11:14 Breaking news: Harvey Weinstein began drilling for oil in several righteous SNL cast members, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.

9729 2018-01-13 17:11:10 My car holds an extra two quarts of oil so my oil changes are $50 
9730 2018-01-13 17:11:08 Oh ok thanks...mine is oily I just wanted to know if the coconut oil will be suitable for oily skin.

9734 2018-01-13 17:10:31 Even if you don't believe in facts "Steve" you should not want oil spills on our coastline. There are always oil spills and our fragile coastal communities will end up paying the price. These small towns depend on tourism. A spill would ruin them.

9741 2018-01-13 17:10:09 Oil changes are me least favorite thing about owning a car.  Also intense repair bills...but those haven't started up yet.  Knock on wood.
9742 2018-01-13 17:10:07 We’re gonna TAKE Norway’s oil?
9743 2018-01-13 17:09:39 And they'd still be expelling 5m EU citizens...removing a huge chunk of common fishing grounds...removing the EU's only significant oil producer...5 of the world's best universities that are all engaged in pan-EU research...why would they do all that?

9746 2018-01-13 17:09:20 I definitely will. Running errands and getting my oil changed at the moment. I record it though. Thank you

9748 2018-01-13 17:09:08 TIL: we have all been eating hummus wrong. Stop eating it with olive oil. Eat it with pine nuts and a dash of melted ghee. You will thank me (and the Syrians who taught me this) for greatly improving your quality of life.

9762 2018-01-13 17:07:02 When I lived in the northeast,  I spent at least $1000 on oil to heat my home during the winter! So yah! 1000 is pretty good money when it's 10 degrees outside.

There was a point to the olive oil story which you missed.
Basically, continuous EU interference in our lives.
Are you really so stupid you can’t see the problem with the EU?

9773 2018-01-13 17:05:14 I think that is a matter of most people have no desire to open their hood and do anything under it. 

I could easily change my own oil, but have no desire to do so. Would rather pay the $25 premium.
9774 2018-01-13 17:04:41 Neither Sweden or Noway fluoridate the water so you don't need a filter. In the meantime get some pure clove oil, put some on a q-tip and dab it around and into the crack in your tooth. It'll kill the pain until you can get to a dentist.
9775 2018-01-13 17:04:01 Make sure you hoes drink nothing but water today!! Take your birth control if you choose and your multivitamins !!!! Rub ya body down with oil and Aveeno after you bathe !! God bless

9782 2018-01-13 17:03:29 The reason we don't have NextGen nuclear is fearmongering and far too little R&D. People serious about fossil fuel concerns should have been nuclear advocates long ago. It's not happening, probably because they have more fun bashing coal and oil. But we need real energy.

I prefer clean water and air
9811 2018-01-13 17:00:34 maybe the lemon juice will lessen the amount of oil. I guess I'll see if over all the lemon juice will make me go bald b/c of acidity...lol

9817 2018-01-13 17:00:07 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

9820 2018-01-13 16:59:50 1/2 It is like a cross between an Orange & Lime. Green when unripe, then changes to a pale Orange colour. I use the essential oil.  Should be careful if using the oil in the sun as it contains furocoumarins, which heighten skins sensitivity to sunlight...

9829 2018-01-13 16:58:43 Saudi Arabia seeks arrest of citizens on wanted list who are abroad - claim it's corruption. Trump admin & other world ldrs say nothing & Prince knows they won't as they want Aramco oil deals. It's all abt $s.

9832 2018-01-13 16:58:35 โตขึ้นเยอะเลยลูก
9833 2018-01-13 16:58:31 It's not a silver bullet. However it's a start. Eat what you kill is the way to go. It'll stop Jigawa from building mosques with oil rents and sokoto from building a N700m house in Abuja for the Sultan
9834 2018-01-13 16:58:19 Oil money?
9835 2018-01-13 16:58:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
9836 2018-01-13 16:58:17 if you’re gonna put any heat on your hair , yeah because it’s made to protect your hair from direct heat , the oil will make your hair sizzle as if you were cooking chickens in a pan lol but you can apply the oil afterwards
9837 2018-01-13 16:58:12 CBD oil, Hempseed capsules, changes life's without feeling like crap!!!! I detoxed off 13 prescriptions and I'm alive and feel better. HELLO

9840 2018-01-13 16:57:46 Coconut oil on my skin makes it itchy and burns, issa no for me dawg
9841 2018-01-13 16:57:43 Candles lit, Lauryn playing, the scent from the coconut oil rising from my body, with a book and pen to write always sets the mood. This is my luxury 
9842 2018-01-13 16:57:38 He is just teaching himself to be you and your coconut oil. 
9843 2018-01-13 16:57:35 Neck Oil on draught @theactresspub @nomadicrevery
9844 2018-01-13 16:57:30 I love Coconut oil. I swear by it. I didnt even think to pick up Coconut oil capsules. I use it in my hair once a week. And if I have dry lips. I'm gonna try mixing it w/ my Oatmeal lotion!
9845 2018-01-13 16:57:24 But the oil boiler heating your mansion using oil from southern Gulf of Mexico states is perfectly fine.
9846 2018-01-13 16:57:23 Like they say ..
Amla Hair Oil goes a long way ..

Amla 82

9850 2018-01-13 16:57:11 When looking on youtube for ..something...i stumbled onto a video stating coconut oil and lemon juice when mixed will help gray hair return
9851 2018-01-13 16:57:03 Count them and highlight what these states are contributing to the nation's income

Oil rents and lagos VAT is available that's why they have the time to carry their kaya to @AsoRock 

What a pity
9852 2018-01-13 16:56:30 Love #AMJoy but you should not be allowed on any legitimate news shows. Take your snake oil con over to Fox.
9853 2018-01-13 16:56:27 @glossier you should make a haloscope highlighter that doesn’t contain almond oil!!! 
9854 2018-01-13 16:56:15 Banyak yang saranin: Cuka apel Bragg, Freeman mask yg Mint Lemon, TBS Tea Tree Oil

9856 2018-01-13 16:56:07 And if you’ve only had the thick, pre-cooked ones, then you’ve never had a flour tortilla.

Buy the raw tortillas in the refrigerated section. It takes seconds to cook them in a skillet. Use a little oil, too.

You’re welcome.
9857 2018-01-13 16:56:06 That took me OUT during homecoming my freshman year. And Omega oil, which had me GONE during the step show. 
9858 2018-01-13 16:55:52 Estate atento al precio del oil. Sin conflictos geopoliticos podria buscar equilibrio 5 dls mas abajo. Eso impactaria...
9859 2018-01-13 16:55:45 Oil dey Morata head but e be like say e no reach e brain.
9860 2018-01-13 16:55:33 Chelsea can be more successful if they can monetize the oil from morata's hair

9866 2018-01-13 16:55:00 Where else can we sell oil?
9867 2018-01-13 16:54:58 Im attempting home made chips again.. Im failing.. I put too much salt in the oil.. Yes I add the salt to the oil so the chips can be already salted ala McDs..

9869 2018-01-13 16:54:47 finally discovered that coconut oil and my face doesn’t go well together
9870 2018-01-13 16:54:41 tea tree oil
9871 2018-01-13 16:54:22 Could be why all the  #ShadowBanning , Isn't this right @Jack 
9872 2018-01-13 16:54:16 African Black Soap,Tamanu Oil(use as a daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF,at all times),Lemon Brightening Overnight Serum(use daily at night after cleansing),Activated Charcoal mask(use once/twice a week & Green tea exfoliating scrub (use once/twice a week)
9873 2018-01-13 16:54:13 My grandma predicts that when oil runs out, our mode of transportation will return to horse-drawn carriages. I'm glad my generation has so much to look forward to...
9874 2018-01-13 16:54:13 Might want to check how much oil is naturally released into the ocean every second of every day.
9875 2018-01-13 16:54:07 @Talkmaster did you know that NYC filed suit against 4 major oil companies over climate change.  It’s the Oul Co.’s fault the climate has changed and they are dealing with the winter storms
9876 2018-01-13 16:54:05 Your MCM is an oil worker
Your MCM carry oil for head
Your MCM has 3 goals in 16 games..
9877 2018-01-13 16:53:45 Creo que ya nadie se acuerda de Midnight Oil, salvo vos y ahora yo que lei este tuit.
9878 2018-01-13 16:53:30 Nice. I like to make my own pizzas with olive oil (instead of sauce) crushed garlic, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and sausage. Whenever that blaze store goes up in Buffalo you should try it!
9879 2018-01-13 16:53:27 น่าสน
9880 2018-01-13 16:53:20 Baby oil or an after shower moisturizer. I have to use them
9881 2018-01-13 16:53:13 Poor utter shit today Chelsea  #CFC #CHELEI
9882 2018-01-13 16:53:12 So the #GoldenKnights meet the #Oilers for the second time this season. The Oil are now in sin city, on Connor’s birthday, on the day before their bye week...

Oh.. um, this game will be... um.. very interesting..
9883 2018-01-13 16:53:08 <it works on a couple of levels. The warmth/massage helps the oil glands work/keep pores clean, which "can" aid growth. I get>
9884 2018-01-13 16:53:04 Gonna teach my children life skills. How to change tires, change oil, cook, clean, iron, etc. If I have all boys they're going to know how to live on their own because I refuse to raise men who have to depend on another human being to survive.
9885 2018-01-13 16:52:47 Only in Chicago do you wait for your oil to get changed and a vendor comes thru with a cooler full of tamales #MyCity
9886 2018-01-13 16:52:42 Can i use this castor oil for relief..?
9887 2018-01-13 16:52:30 CNL oil and Marj. #SMORGAS
9888 2018-01-13 16:52:30 Of oil. Darren and I have to look around, Eva has fallen on your pectorals. George: Your parents'll never let in.
9889 2018-01-13 16:52:17 More oil, less cocoa solids = different / worse taste.
9890 2018-01-13 16:52:16 Maybe it will be the insurance companies paying for these damages who finally put a stop to the "violence justified by offense" excuse.
(Also, probably the only industry strong enough to go up against the oil cartels upholding the "offended at the sight of a woman" defense.)
9891 2018-01-13 16:52:16 Excuse me!!!Wich Manchester is the one that spent a lot of oil dollars to make the team that leads the @premierleague ???
9892 2018-01-13 16:52:08 Totally ignoring the rebound in oil prices of course, the question is what would the rebound be without the Ndp, probably a lot better.  The truth is the energy industry is very resilient despite having a turd of a government in charge.
9893 2018-01-13 16:52:00 He just put  a target on himself...Big Oil has full support of our govt n folks that fight them have suddenly died or disappeared
9894 2018-01-13 16:51:46 Eric uses the fat from bacon as “oil” to cook my chicken and I’m so in love. Lmao
9895 2018-01-13 16:51:38 Hmm. And olive oil?
9896 2018-01-13 16:51:33 There's nothing more confusing (I find) when you're try to work out a skin care routine for dry AND acne prone skin.  Not oily, I skip the oil and go straight to the spots it seems
9897 2018-01-13 16:51:21 @OGJOnline @lyft will oil prices hit $80 if so we might see #tesla shine again as gas price will be close to $4.00 again in #california
9898 2018-01-13 16:51:14 Bill  DE blasio of New York what a idiot files a lawsuit against oil companies for polluting yet what is he drive around all day what a double standard democratic b*******
9899 2018-01-13 16:51:04 Dry brush and coffee and coconut oil scrubs. You can make the scrub super easy. The caffeine from the coffee is absorbed by your skin. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Also, carbonation causes cellulite so stay away from anything bubbly.
9900 2018-01-13 16:51:02 It’s true , but we have to take in consideration Isis was created by Mossad and America to get the oil and gold , also for the resources of natural gas and preparing for Israel expansion in the area
9901 2018-01-13 16:50:38 A country of 5.3mm with a booming oil complex that funds a lot of the social safety net. I find it laughable that an attempt to compare our huge diverse country to Norway, is the pinnacle of idiocy. Norway already exists here, It's called Minnesota. Jesus you people are dense.
9902 2018-01-13 16:50:18 productive day......good bike ride, do a oil change on the cub, #avgeek and had a quick flight!
9903 2018-01-13 16:50:14 Currently getting my oil changed
9904 2018-01-13 16:50:14 Morata uses more Koprel Oil thn they use at Udipi restaurant to Fry  meduvadas for a whole day.
9905 2018-01-13 16:50:08 A general and rapid clean-up  of oil crooks is needed.
9906 2018-01-13 16:50:04 during bv 2, hoseok said that "if you run out of cooking oil you can use the one on my face" hahaha ! just cant stop laughing. I love him so much hahaha
9907 2018-01-13 16:50:01 Have my eye on your midnight facial oil :)
9908 2018-01-13 16:50:00 My car has:
A coolant leak
A brake fluid leak
A fuel leak
A power steering leak
An oil leak

My car is leakier than Hillary’s emails

9910 2018-01-13 16:49:51 Coconut oil drippin all on his boots he cyah get d ball under control
9911 2018-01-13 16:49:50 "Pastor" is right, he is cut from the same slimy snake oil cloth that POTUS is. I feel sorry for anyone naive enough to join his congregation.
9912 2018-01-13 16:49:42 @T_Kaine Got your email about offshore drilling. The risks are no greater than they are everywhere else in the world that is drilled. The BP spill was bad no question, but dealing with a nuclear Iran THX Obama  supplies 25% of worlds oil greater risk. US needs energy independence
9913 2018-01-13 16:49:42 How many times a day do you secretly drain your oil?
9914 2018-01-13 16:49:32 Well she always favored Big Oil it's because the state she was elected in is controlled by Big Oil
9915 2018-01-13 16:49:12 Coconut oil is the best makeup remover hands down.
9916 2018-01-13 16:49:02 Snoopy is awaiting his chariot to the dub dr  hoping he doesn’t have too many other issues along with the castrophic oil leak #dublife #JoysOfADub #VWT4

9919 2018-01-13 16:48:56 I should start charging for making and oil change, it's not a hard job, and I don't mind getting my hands dirty.
9920 2018-01-13 16:48:40 Condoleeza is the worst Secretary of State ... she is a Russian stooge selling out America for Russian oil money. She endorsed trump. She’s a traitor
9921 2018-01-13 16:48:33 i have the day off work and i’m overwhelmed with what i wanna do. Should i get my car oil changed? Should i go to Paris?
9922 2018-01-13 16:48:33 My whole life smells like coconut oil now.
9923 2018-01-13 16:48:33 Bush shouldn’t have invaded Iraq for oil, could’ve just squeezed morata’s pillow.
9924 2018-01-13 16:48:28 This is all he does. Why? Because he shouldn’t have been in the job in the first place. This position was for him to manipulate oil for Putin. That’s it that’s all!
9925 2018-01-13 16:48:27 I am hardcore hindu but I believe that Sikhs are our dharma brother like Buddhist. If we need to eradicate this Monotheistic Danav from earth which get boon of Oil. Than we need to unite like Pandvas for culture Mahabharata of Kalyug.

9926 2018-01-13 16:48:20 Put some olbas oil or Vick on the wall dogs aren't keen on the smell

9929 2018-01-13 16:48:01 Hope that Business of Oil and GAS industry in this State touch to new Heights in Future along with Development of various Skills to create a new job profile for people of Jharkhand.I & my family Congrats with best wishes to Hon'ble PNG MINISTER,CM TEAMसुरेन्द्रपालकेशवपुरम दिल्ली
9930 2018-01-13 16:47:33 The point is to get the world of fossil fuels ASAP. Ours is the dirtiest. The point is NO OIL. We cannot control the rest of the world. We sit on our assets while China and Korea become world leaders in renewables with economies of scale. 

Brilliant.
9931 2018-01-13 16:47:22 Yes, because the state owns the wealth of 70 years with unending oil drilling invested into private companies. If you take it into account 60% isnt much, but a result of fairly rightwing fiscal policy in recent years.
9932 2018-01-13 16:47:14 Plymouth attacked by 106 Luftwaffe bombers tonight 1941 damaging the gas works, hospital and electricity works killing 26 and wounding 117 others. Two Auxiliary firemen were awarded George Medals for putting out a fire on an oil tanker that would otherwise have exploded.
9933 2018-01-13 16:47:05 you know those people that are ALWAYS condescending? like literally everything they say is a smart ass remark??? why are you like that like how much internal term oil do you have??? 2018 work on yourself damn.

9935 2018-01-13 16:46:55 For you saying #Norwegians wouldn't want to move here. First,  it's a very homogeneous country with some of the world's largest oil reserves. They only have approx. 5 million people in the country. There's little immigration from #ShitholeCountries who suck off the welfare state.
9936 2018-01-13 16:46:53 That’s a beautiful solar powered boat you have there oh right it’s a V8. How many oil patch workers do you guide a year? Hypocrite!
9937 2018-01-13 16:46:46 baby oil, vaseline, sama remover pada umumnya
9938 2018-01-13 16:46:15 Quite! With beard oil and comb in the pocket of your shell suit jacket. 
9939 2018-01-13 16:46:15 @PYAradio In your 1st segment on KNBR you mention 1. Rising interest rates 2. higher wages 3. higher oil prices. These items seem inflationary? Could this lead to our next correction/recession?
9940 2018-01-13 16:46:14 My favorite oil right now is thieves, diffusing a lot now during the winter months to boost my immune system!
9941 2018-01-13 16:46:14 Took my car in for an oil change and emission test and somehow i spent $800 
9942 2018-01-13 16:46:13 Cali. and NY are now suing the Oil co. over Fake Global Warming that will raise gas prices for all of Americans.
We need to Sue them.
9943 2018-01-13 16:46:07 Got my oil changed now I’m ready to Z-Game now 
9944 2018-01-13 16:45:55 Only a matter of time before USA invades Morata’s hair for oil.
9945 2018-01-13 16:45:55 These kids calling what EFF did at hnm violent need a pacifier. Next time they will eat OMO and drink cooking oil, then you can talk about violence. #AfricaFirst
9946 2018-01-13 16:45:53 i’m glad i saw that.. someone always has the essential oil diffuser running in the living room, i honestly hate it and the way it smells so any excuse to turn it off is fine djksdhsj
9947 2018-01-13 16:45:48 I know right?? He lied about his education!! He is a snake oil salesman. Him and Pastor Darryl Scott
9948 2018-01-13 16:45:46 Blend 2 tablespoons beer with 3 cups jerky. Mix into  Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve on salad
9949 2018-01-13 16:45:38 use tea tree oil as a spot treatment every morning and night before your moisturizer but make sure you dilute it with water because that shit’s harsh af. pimples went away in less than a week!
9950 2018-01-13 16:45:25 Had a 1030 appointment for an oil change and im still here... Did they go to Texas to get the oil themselves?!
9951 2018-01-13 16:45:17 That’s like having the option to buy a truck & and an SUV for the same price. But you buy the truck & put a camper over the bed & the truck needs more frequent oil changes. But to each his own
9952 2018-01-13 16:45:13 D-scam has a number of brands too. Just visit the essential oil aisle
9953 2018-01-13 16:45:12 Morata playin like peak Chelsea era Fernando Torres wit coconut oil in his hair
9954 2018-01-13 16:45:04 No never, KSA supported women in the past 2 years more than before, as a country of oil we're too late but we try to catch the road and move forward as fast as possible
9955 2018-01-13 16:45:03 ジョージボイスで「ポプテピピック…！」って言ってほしいって気持ち、ある
9956 2018-01-13 16:45:00 .@realDonaldTrump 
Did you spread disinformation about uranium to create audience fatigue cover for turning Saudi Arabia nuclear? Seems like they have plenty of sunshine & oil - which would negate the need for nuclear energy.
9957 2018-01-13 16:45:00 The good ole Houston Oilers! I miss the oil derrick and baby blue uniforms. That was my team!

9960 2018-01-13 16:44:56 The thing is, I kinda wanted to respond with "I drive". The argument was something about dinosaurs and oil...
9961 2018-01-13 16:44:41 You want to cut funding for after school activities but spent 3 mil plus every week to go play golf, you want to drill for oil off our coast, how has that worked in the past? We don’t nee more oil we need to go to clean renewable energy
9962 2018-01-13 16:44:28 Was Morata carrying a leaking tin of oil on his head before the game or something #CHELEI
9963 2018-01-13 16:44:27 Have mercy RT @kennagq: With the amount of oil in Morata's hair , he can join OPEC
9964 2018-01-13 16:44:19 Olive oil margarine......
9965 2018-01-13 16:44:11 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
9966 2018-01-13 16:44:06 Lighting grass that’s 4-5 feet high non defensible space it’s California. We had a wet winter and those grasses are dry .
It’s in the news that no one reported. Oakland almost burned to the ground years ago because people planted trees  loaded with oil.
9967 2018-01-13 16:44:05 Sonoma is blessed with so many amazing foods from cheese, lamb, vegetables, seafood, olive oil and passionate people producing it. #winepw #SonomaStrong

9973 2018-01-13 16:43:33 check out the kiehls mask because their products look good and I've been meaning to try them out!  And double cleansing is using an oil based cleanser first, which effectively removes make-up because water based cleansers don't target that as effectively and then following up
9974 2018-01-13 16:43:32 Did Morata empty one bottle of anointing oil on his head?
9975 2018-01-13 16:43:29 Can we also sue Venezuela for its oil production?
9976 2018-01-13 16:43:14 Norway and Denmark both export tons of oil, Sweden doesn't even come close. They need nothing from the Islamic world.

9978 2018-01-13 16:43:09 45's choice of replacement will be some nimrod who wants to fill in the  put an oil rig in the middle of the canal.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9980 2018-01-13 16:43:05 Use a hair mask! I use the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque!
9981 2018-01-13 16:42:50 Why is Porto Neroli Body Oil suddenly $145 instead of $68? I feel like Tom Ford is telling me I can’t afford to be myself
9982 2018-01-13 16:42:38 Applied coconut oil on my face yesterday & when i woke up i felt like i was reborn
9983 2018-01-13 16:42:35 Some of us don't need beard oil to grow our beards, nature is awesome.
9984 2018-01-13 16:42:31 Yes, but it is a different kind of Bergamot.
Citrus Bergamia (Bergamot) Orange which grows in the Calabrian part of Italy, is the one which is used to flavour Earl Grey Tea.  It is also a good essential oil, very uplifting on the psyche, as you would expect from a citrus fruit.
9985 2018-01-13 16:42:24 You're going to cause the tax payers to fund a frivolous law suit!! You will loose because the oil companies have reduced emissions more in this country then any other. The Paris agreement was just to help other countries do the same on our money. They don't have the debt we do.

9988 2018-01-13 16:41:56 Between global warming and Trump's drilling expansion, I'm looking forward to seeing some oil rigs off the coast of Colorado.
9989 2018-01-13 16:41:48 Working with the Nazis in WWII? Not George Soros.
Maybe he was thinking of Prescott Bush?
Or Ford Motor Company? Or Standard Oil?
9990 2018-01-13 16:41:47 The oil change place says 15 minutes or less and I just don't believe that

9992 2018-01-13 16:41:26 Julia Child was a great teacher! I like to use olive oil without taste. If it has specific taste, it will be overpowering in mayo. By the way home mayonnaise great to treat hair.
9993 2018-01-13 16:41:23 Kalo untuk urutan skincare malam yg aku punya gimana? Maksudnya olive oil & shooting gelnya urutan keberapa?

9997 2018-01-13 16:41:00 In order to obtain preferential oil rights in the new regime, in case anyone thought it was some sort of boy-scout A-Team operation...

Being a terrorist is ok as long as it's against people we don't like?
9998 2018-01-13 16:40:59 @Phantom_Thread is like a fresh oil painting. I wish going to the theatre felt like that more often. It is like witnessing something you know in your bones is gonna be around and relevant in 100 yrs. A masterwork by artisans at the top of their craft! That celluloid is alive.
9999 2018-01-13 16:40:58 Oh yes they are. Oil prices rising, healthcare rising, cost of services, food, etc. as tied into fuel costs. 

After tax $650 ?  It’s already been spent Mr. $350 a bottle of wine guy. 

30% are stupid Ryan, we are not.  @NancyPelosi

10009 2018-01-13 16:39:08 It's never too late. I used to do a lot of apparel contracting business there. Haiti wasn't always this bad. Corruption and earthquakes can really do a number on you. 
Politicians especially,  look at Venezuela. Joe Kennedy used to give away thier oil to US

10012 2018-01-13 16:38:42 I always dislike going through the big farms and oil fields in North Dakota because everybody and their mom has these new badass Chevy Silverados. I want one 
10013 2018-01-13 16:38:41 You know Liz that the tar balls are a natural occurrence because there is so much oil under the beaches seeping through. It's not offshore drilling that cause the tar balls. Infact it might actually improve the land to remove some of the pressure.
10014 2018-01-13 16:38:38 There must be a lack of oil there..
10015 2018-01-13 16:38:32 Hmm.. could it be the no oil drilling off Mar-al-Lago and only Florida beaches thing? Another outrage.
10016 2018-01-13 16:38:25 Yeah this one I go to I think close at 2. Cause they don’t just change oil.
10017 2018-01-13 16:38:25 My girl cat has been swatty all night and this morning. She only behaves like this when her ears are a problem. So,olive oil rub down and a gentle cleaning. It days like these my  male cat wishes she were not adopted. He gets his eats cleaned too.
10018 2018-01-13 16:38:24 Geologists have long known earth has experienced periods of global warming, alternating with ice ages millions of years ago. Oil companies had nothing to do with it. Who do the whackos blame for that? God was and still is in control#core samples
