3 2018-09-11 23:59:34 He also doesn’t need to be on the entire year. Is just that that possibility (coming back) limits what you can do.  Certain amount of risk.
4 2018-09-11 23:59:33 It's come to my attention that my troops are absolute garbage right now. So, new training regimine! First excersise... work together! Seriously, you guys are as good as working as one unit as oil is good with mixing with water.

6 2018-09-11 23:58:50 It’s smells like peppermint oil in here

14 2018-09-11 23:57:24 Very small traces of oil getting mixed??? Oil which doesn't include impure (najis) ingredients? I doubt that will have much of an effect (For my own peace of mind). The main bodies of oil used for cooking each item (fish, veggie patty, chicken, fries, or pies) remain separate
15 2018-09-11 23:57:22 Oil
16 2018-09-11 23:57:11 Well I'm poor so I don't have an oil diffuser. That's nice tho.

40 2018-09-11 23:56:37 Alex Jones runs a business catering to wingnuts.  He’s a modern snake oil merchant and knows he is, laughing all the way to the bank.
41 2018-09-11 23:56:34 Even when crude oil price was low, BJP raised the excise duty to con the middle class and bleed them to aid the crony capitalists and to fill their coffers. No wonder they are spending crores on ads and PRs and on Yoga videos. Jumlabazz party.

Without SA's support of the Petrodollar the American economy looks like Zimbabwe over night.  
Why do other countries need US dollars?  
To buy Oil.  
Any country that tries to get away from dollars
gets a big helping of "Freedom" shoved down their throat.

46 2018-09-11 23:56:09 I need to go there. The purification oil isn’t cutting it! 
47 2018-09-11 23:56:08 If I didn't follow fundamentals of hard oil I might be nervous.  While it is regrettable to not always buy at the low points, there is no reason oil prices will not go much higher and for much longer.  Once balance sheets improved, share buybacks (at worse) will force valuations.
48 2018-09-11 23:55:47 Bengal government reduced the price of petrol and diesel by ₹1/L over the daily price set by the oil companies.Some respite for sure.

50 2018-09-11 23:55:35 Methane, which is among the most powerful greenhouse gases, routinely leaks from oil and gas wells, and energy companies have long said that the rules requiring them to test for emissions were costly and burdensome.
51 2018-09-11 23:55:11 Not me dear, I swear him would have to sleep with one eye open. I would hot oil him backside.
52 2018-09-11 23:55:08 As for the SNP warning the farmers. I think farmers have a better idea and it's their risk to take at the end of the day over brexit. Scottish farming would of been seriously affected by an indyref yes vote by now. In fact Scotland would of been bankrupt by now due to oil prices
53 2018-09-11 23:55:07 I use to part in down the middle too.
54 2018-09-11 23:55:02 Want a clear conscience while tucking into your @Nestle @PepsiCo & @KFC? Then first tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to suspend disgraced #palmoil company @Indofood
55 2018-09-11 23:54:47 My regular mechanic tells me to change my oil regularly but he always finds some add'l $500 needed repair during the oil change. But I have to keep going back because I hear his competitors are worse.

56 2018-09-11 23:54:42 Bullshit, speak for yourself as you attempt to scramble back some ground, only a blind fuckwit couldn’t see that oil is eerily perfect for humans to burn as fuel. It’s concentrated, portable, plentiful, cheap - an amazing freedom giver that allows even the most humble mobility.

67 2018-09-11 23:53:47 Likely not the easiest of sell jobs on a guy who would be looking at essentially eating two full seasons...if the chance of him suiting up is a real possibility.
68 2018-09-11 23:53:36 Other reality of California refinery sector is that the fuels that are not being consumed in state are increasingly being exported to places like Mexico which has new markets for Big Oil because of MX energy sector “reform.” Cap-and-trade greenwashes CA as gas station for Pacific
69 2018-09-11 23:53:28 To me financial wellness means having money saved for a rainy day but also having fun money to spend here and then. It feels like peace of mind and breathing easy when the car breaks down or needs an oil change or if any random unexpected expense comes up. #BGIOMindful

While most people are busy doing other things he was busy positioning himself 2 points he will be needed moreover his mother also took those bold steps & all the son needs is to follow up. Make yourself wanted

75 2018-09-11 23:52:40 Depends on the oil(s)! You can diffuse, use them topically, ingest certain ones, the list goes on! I love even the small selection I have.
76 2018-09-11 23:52:32 Try some coconut oil!
77 2018-09-11 23:52:23 Someday I will find the balance between hair oil and dry shampoo. But unfortunately, that day is not today. #girlproblems

92 2018-09-11 23:51:33 RUSSIA'S NOVAK SAYS WE WILL DISCUSS OIL MARKETS WITH OPEC IN ALGERIA THIS MONTH, WILL TAKE A DECISION ON WHAT MORE TO DO
93 2018-09-11 23:51:28 There is nothing to destroy, there is NO market for our oil outside the US, the shipping stats show that. Asia doesn't want baby Aframax tankers, they want VLCC's that the Port of Vancouver can't take.
94 2018-09-11 23:51:15 Chicken w lemon, chili, onion. Sautéed carrots and broccoli w olive oil. And some rice. Its a start. I try and balance my unhealthy side.

104 2018-09-11 23:50:09 On the same day the Trump admin rolls back common sense methane standards for the U.S. oil and gas industry, the head of @agencia_asea @carlosderegules reaffirms Mexico’s leadership on this critical climate issue speaking at #GCAS2018 #SuperPollutant Day
105 2018-09-11 23:50:07 Thank you cause I googled it.. the said 10 minutes and apply olive oil and leave in conditioner?
106 2018-09-11 23:50:07 Maybe the "death to America" chants would stop if our "national security" position was to stop bombing poor people in oil rich countries.

116 2018-09-11 23:49:12 I cleaned my entire apartment, did laundry, washed bedding, got my oil changed in my car, ran errands, baked (paleo) banana bread, made dinner, and prepped smoothies. I may or may not have drank a pot of coffee this morning.

121 2018-09-11 23:48:13 My favorite self care routine would have to be laying in bed, with all the lights off, listening to a guided meditation with incense going & closing my eyes & relaxing.. then take a warm shower & put on my favorite essential oil + lotion and relax with my dog. 
122 2018-09-11 23:47:57 Let's work on voting our state California away from the United States a country into itself. We will control all the docks all the offshore oil drilling, and stop Trump from destroying the Pacific Ocean. Yes Jerry Brown get your ass in gear. Vote Democrat

124 2018-09-11 23:47:54 Maybe. Tough war to win, cost/benefit not compelling. But you know, if Cheney hadn't been so impatient to get to the oil fields of Iraq, if W hadn't stood down at Tora Bora, maybe Afghanistan would have gone better
125 2018-09-11 23:47:51 Deep State & New World Order folks did this to start WARS for oil and destabilize governments replaced by NWO
126 2018-09-11 23:47:48 Remind people, they need to ask themselves why they became extremist. If I remember my history  Osama bin Laden was upset by what the United States Policies were, especially because we wanted the oil in the middle east! We have a big responsibility in this whole from the get go!
127 2018-09-11 23:47:43 That’s a laugh, when the oil cos. moved to shared stand by vessels, thereby cutting the numbers.
128 2018-09-11 23:47:33 Does anyone know of a good CBD oil for cats that’s not super expensive?
129 2018-09-11 23:47:27 How did the production of this food affect the local economy or traditional consumers? (look into quinoa for an example of how this can play out, also palm oil is another biggie for this)

136 2018-09-11 23:46:23 I really do not see it that way. First of all the US has bent to the wishes of special interest groups for as long as I can remember, particularly oil, banks, big pharma, & of course the 1%. Pots & kettles eh? We do what is best for Canadians #BuyCanadian 1/

138 2018-09-11 23:45:32 Yup - that might happen and then we’ll have to eat more broccoli for calcium, lentils, whey...  Same question - what happens when Trump stops exporting oil and fuel to Canada?  Please respond to this.
139 2018-09-11 23:45:29 YESSS!! Poured holy oil over my laptop right after!
140 2018-09-11 23:45:00 May be you can announce a great Tax relief polic to adopt Electric cars and nil import duty on such Hybrid cars, this will reduce pressure on Oil imports, pay back to these nations in same coin and see oil prices will also reduce @narendramodi @PMOIndia @FinMinIndia @arunjaitley
141 2018-09-11 23:44:56 Because they've allowed themselves to be co-opted by Big Tobacco, Dirty Coal, Big Oil, evangelicals, the Ku Klux Klan, Big Banks, Big Pharma, the Koch brothers, Nazis, fascism, and the NRA. Now they need Russia to help them cheat.

That's why.
142 2018-09-11 23:44:54 9/11 was a bunch of Saudis with Saudi government support, attacking us. Most Sunni Islam Terror groups have ties to Saudi Arabia. 

Yet the us continues to support the Saudi government and its interests. Which is to spread radical sunni islam. All because of oil .
143 2018-09-11 23:44:52 Producers of food have to wait for rail cars to get their products to market  while rail capacity is overtaxed by oil.  Pipelines are much safer than rail and not nearly as risky as rail. LOOK AT THE FACTS.

147 2018-09-11 23:44:15 Is up strong on wheater, hurricane heading to coast, so basically is bs to price that in, will end up as usual buy rumor sell news, but oil when rally can be dangerous to short so trade careful
148 2018-09-11 23:43:58 We really just poured vegetable oil into a water bottle and stole 3 eggs to make boxed cake. I hate college
149 2018-09-11 23:43:36 How much methane comes off  Seattle sewer Patty?, and what about all those gallons of sewage did Seattle pump into Puget Sound? Most wells vent and burn the methane off before the oil shows up. Normal process. Get a real job and quit the baloney at which you are so good at.

157 2018-09-11 23:42:34 I've been involved in the oil/gas patch for over 20 years, I've only seen 2 females who were hands on, even when companies were screaming for warm bodies of any sex.
You are a fool.
158 2018-09-11 23:42:29 Its good! Spoon of butter, spoon of coconut oil, packet of stevia.

160 2018-09-11 23:42:18 So the theory about how Aboriginal people got to the Americas is that they crossed an ice bridge between what is now Russia and Alaska. How did that ice bridge melt is there wasn't any pick up trucks, SUVs or anything burning oil at the time.

172 2018-09-11 23:41:13 this facial oil is so good but would i pay whatever 60% of $54 is for it?

177 2018-09-11 23:40:36 Where oil is involved all Trump (& his big business buddies) see is a $ sign. He already said, on record, that he’d bomb Iran and then US companies would go in and take over the oil business after. He appears to be acting like a predator not a protector.

It is NOT despite US military action but BECAUSE of US military action. 
The US is currently bombing  7 nations. Why? OIL or Resources.

195 2018-09-11 23:37:57 keep it simple. brush some olive oil on some good bread. macerate tomatoes with red wine vinegar, salt, pepper and olive oil. Crush that burrata on the toast and smother with tomatoes. Eat. Pardon the lack of oxford comma.
196 2018-09-11 23:37:45 Baby oil
197 2018-09-11 23:37:44 That’s feeble. 1950-70s with few market intervention Venezuela prospered. State intervention creeps in & the decline starts. Chavez turns on the middle class ruining the economy but the economy survives due to the high oil prices. Oil prices tanks and so do his bullshit economics
198 2018-09-11 23:37:25 Since the big ‘purge” in corruption Saudi has come a long way toward corralling Iran & their influence in Syria & Yemen. Yemen is crawling with Iranian backed Houti terrorists. Saudi North of Yemen & since cut off from cabal they need to protect themselves, will run out of oil.

203 2018-09-11 23:36:28 I still can’t figure out how to say “oil” the way it wants me to 
204 2018-09-11 23:36:25 And let’s not forget Papa Koch (Fred) helped build oil refineries for Stalin *AND* Hitler.

Whoops! There’s that damn horseshoe again!

209 2018-09-11 23:35:58 Why do you still use oil then ? Self evidently your a hypocrite ?
210 2018-09-11 23:35:37 oil spills + wars + forest fires + anxiety medication = increased GDP
211 2018-09-11 23:35:23 Yo why they gotta make beard oil bottles look like vape juice bottles? It’d suck if you got those mixed up

And the list goes on--

216 2018-09-11 23:34:50 If he likes a challenge boy would he fit in with the Oil
217 2018-09-11 23:34:49 The problem is far worse than economic sanctions. Inflation of 20% percent before sanctions, remember the Bolivar fuerte of Chavez?  Oil production is failing from 2000. Poverty at 40%.  It's important to point out that Chavez lived a supercycle of crude. They run deficits of 12%
218 2018-09-11 23:34:42 I’m doing a coconut oil treatment in my hair and I’m supossed to leave my hair wrapped up for as long as possible but my hair wrap is giving me a migraine I’m a weak bitch who’s gonna have bad hair forever

220 2018-09-11 23:34:11 oil and gas companies spent $400,000 A DAY lobbying during the 2012 election. how the hell is this even legal???????? these companies are killing us and the planet to make a buck. why are we letting this happen? 

@ every politician ignoring climate change right now

My favorite with a steak? A whole bunch of half inch cubed root vegetables (kipfler potatoes, sweet potato, parsnip, carrot) roasted with olive oil, coarse sea salt and rosemary.

Every mouthful of steak you can mix with something different.

228 2018-09-11 23:32:15 Forgetting about the filter and shit....i know what bad oil looks like i just need someone to walk me through how to change it. Your directions are phoney and unhelpful 
229 2018-09-11 23:32:14 my plan tonight is to drench myself in coconut oil from head to toe
230 2018-09-11 23:32:03 We're doing it in Maine. There is nothing mild about our climate but thoughtfully designed high performance ASHP systems paired with weatherization can replace gas or oil in many New England homes. Even better if you add solar at the same time.
231 2018-09-11 23:31:52 who cares what caused it?  we don't need it!  the oil boom is exacerbating global warming.  we need incentives for our economy to migrate to clean energy dources. we need disincentives for burning fossil fuel...

235 2018-09-11 23:30:56 Oil will be used one way or another for some time. 

That doesn't mean I am pro-oil, of course I want green energy. It won't happen overnight. 

End of debate on my behalf.

262 2018-09-11 23:26:49 I'd like to add that GWBush could've got him, but oil was the conflict of interest. Happy to say that Obama said he'd go after him and did. Just another reason to thank Obama besides the rise of the economy.
263 2018-09-11 23:26:49 Must be trying to figure out a way to get that $500B Siberian oil deal going again. Or maybe just getting orders from Putin to take back to Trump. #TrustMeNoCollusion

269 2018-09-11 23:25:42 Palm kernel is a by product and as such is not the cause of the environmental problems. Palm oil is and it’s in loads of the food you eat. So when are you going to stop using it?? Oh and tough luck if you can’t find any food to eat without it in it.

282 2018-09-11 23:23:38 It is well documented. This Alt right hate originated from the success of immigrants in the Tech industry. You didn't see this hate when the oil and tobacco industries were booming. The Alt Right groups think all good things should belong to white people.

284 2018-09-11 23:23:14 Excuse me? I guess boxing completely shut down your brain pal. Since when someone has to "live" any crisis to understand and know for sure that the US is after VENEZUELA because it has the BIGGEST OIL RESERVE OF THE PLANET. So, stop getting your head beaten and go study. THINK.
285 2018-09-11 23:23:02 The fact is as raw materials like oil and metals get scarce and rare, these superpowers like Russia, China and even the US will start to devour and rape smaller countries to save their own, as these destroy other countries they will eventually turn on each other in a world war.
286 2018-09-11 23:23:00 Yasuni National Park is under attack from oil drilling. From 1970 till 2007, oil companies were allowed to drill in the rainforest, entirely unchecked. In 2007 Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, proposed a plan to help the rainforest that costs 3.5 billion dollars.
287 2018-09-11 23:22:54 I thought you knew!! Thank you girl I have a bunch of products that help with exfoliating and general dryness/inflammation.Some of my lip scrubs are even edible and I have oil for breakouts/dark spots on the body

289 2018-09-11 23:22:23 Data is the oil. And if you cannot train and clean the #data, probably this discussion is even more important for you @onetrust #GDPR #SEC2SV #EID2018
290 2018-09-11 23:22:17 Most possibly because generally Indian cuisine are prepared with "neutral flavour" oils & those with a high boiling temp. I think, Gumtaj insisted on olive oil for personal consumption 

I wonder if coconut oil would be better? (allergies towards coconut oil is extremely rare)
291 2018-09-11 23:22:16 Halliburton's full name is "Halliburton Energy Services" 

KBR builds shit for them. 

Oil is a major driver of profit.
292 2018-09-11 23:22:08 Give us a break. Those were short-lived terror groups created in response to British reneging on the terms of the Mandate. The Brits took sides, just as they did in N. Ireland. They wanted Arab oil. They wanted to hold on to Palestine in violation of the Mandate.
293 2018-09-11 23:22:03 I know the feeling. Best way to keep seasoning it after the initial process is keep using it. Specifically bacon cause of the oil it creates. I clean mine with hot water, light dry and let sit. Personally I don’t use soap, some do and just re season after
294 2018-09-11 23:21:44 this checks out, longer hair absorbs a lot more oil. mine is also super curly whereas yours is much straighter so that also contributes
295 2018-09-11 23:21:41 おはゆーございます！

297 2018-09-11 23:21:20 Did you read the article? Three factors causing it have little relation to the powers of the President: 1) high oil prices 2) construction after natural disasters 3) an over charged economy which is a continuation of the trend started during Obama in 2009. Long term pessimism.

305 2018-09-11 23:20:22 @anasalhajji  like the Canadians, can Permian producers not transport  oil via railway or trucks
306 2018-09-11 23:20:17 As part of a scheme, Sean Spicer decides not to tell President Trump that oil executives are total winners. Karl Rove collects a welfare check.
307 2018-09-11 23:20:16 Japanese brand DHC has this oil cleanser I’ve heard SO many people buy so I decided to get it! Just tried it today - it smells like they dumped a massive bottle of EVOO and called it a cleanser tbh  but I’m liking it so far!

314 2018-09-11 23:19:12 you will! There's a real delusion that if transmountain was built tomorrow Alberta would return to 80's oil money days. They're gone. Alberta needs to invest not in the new energy for consumption but the production of it. Calgary is one of the sunniest places I've been.
315 2018-09-11 23:19:10 until done to your taste.
Still working on the parsley salad,
Parsley leaves, olive oil, tons of lemon juice salt.
I think going forward lemon zest would add more depth.
Serve with crusty bread.

323 2018-09-11 23:17:58 US stocks shrugged off a subdued start to close higher on Tuesday, as Apple led a jump in technology stocks and a rise in oil prices lifted energy companies.

424 2018-09-11 23:06:32 I agree with that. The stranglehold the oil industry has had on Alberta makes disentangling it a tricky and messy process.   It’s a beast that won’t go down without a fight, made all the more ravenous by the food we’ve shoveled down it’s gullet for half a century
425 2018-09-11 23:06:11 Let's get this straight PM we voted you to do right. These infographics may be of leftists interest. I won't die enjoying cheaper fuel on oil bonds and let my daughter pay for that.

Let's settle this here ! If I wanna use it spread pollution I should pay for it.
426 2018-09-11 23:06:10 I realized lemonade has water in it, so some sort of oil, like Canola.

433 2018-09-11 23:05:10 so yep you do have a potential pathway for fluid to move from within the meninges to the outside world (the assholes who did this injected ABs: "Penicillin in oil and wax is used in prophylactic fashion in all cases.")
434 2018-09-11 23:05:09 It would be petroleum oil and it would kill you and that would be pretty much correct.
435 2018-09-11 23:05:03 She'd probably raise poverty line, while pushing the JG that was the centerpiece of her campaign. Either way I dont think she'd say "having Fortune 500 businesses continue to extract profits from oil and 3rd world countries is good as long as dividends spread around fairly"

437 2018-09-11 23:04:46 D West discovered oil & d oil is tapped to this day w/Western technology. Hence d Muslim countries that have oil owe a lot to d West. W/more advanced Western technology plenty of oil, in fact more than what Muslim countries hav, is now found in US, Russia, Brazil, Norway & so on
438 2018-09-11 23:04:39 If Maxine Waters were GOP, reporters would be camped out on her doorstop asking her how she feels about causing this violence.
439 2018-09-11 23:04:37 Hell us Yankees took advantage of #Mexico #Oil so did #Pemex and wait til the new guy takes over the Oil Unions will rape that
440 2018-09-11 23:04:33 Jamal hates when i put coconut oil all on him but he just doesn’t understand how bad eczema is on his Daddy side  I’m so terrified
441 2018-09-11 23:04:29 When will people get that Collins and Murkowski are corrupt Republican politicians? That they are women means absolutely nothing. They both supported the tax cut, and Murkowski's vote opened the Alaskan wilderness to permanent, destructive oil exploration.
442 2018-09-11 23:04:28 I’m not quite sure if it’s cold or I’m sick but the kiddo and I are under 3 blankets. All sorts of potions taken ginger root oregano oil etc
443 2018-09-11 23:04:24 Agreed on every bloody count! And birds know what's up. 45's afraid of eagles! Potus cowers away from birds.

*kicks things*
444 2018-09-11 23:04:05 America is an oil company with an army.
445 2018-09-11 23:04:05 Welllll- I kinda like all the effects you can achieve with little cost with digital- You can make it look like layered water color, more scratchy like inking or even smooth like oil paint. But I also really love using ink for black and white traditional drawings.
446 2018-09-11 23:03:51 i just can’t abide the ‘standard’ ‘American’ pizza types of pizza. the actual best pizza i’ve had was just olive oil brushed on a base, then rosemary & rock salt, thin & crisp straight from a stone oven.
447 2018-09-11 23:03:45 Just take it down to the shop, they'll replace the oil, should run good as new
448 2018-09-11 23:03:26 My grandpa put me oil in my car and gas wow he’s super nice today!! But thankful
449 2018-09-11 23:03:26 just wasted an hour sewing something that doesnt fit me because half the fabric i used wasnt stretchy, and then i wasted $3 on veggie chips that smelled and tasted like oil paint i am DONE for the day
450 2018-09-11 23:03:20 Yeah you fine as fuck I’ll give you that but can you change my oil in my car
451 2018-09-11 23:03:17 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Donald Jr.. I'll get a good price!
452 2018-09-11 23:03:08 And that's rUK with the benefit of all the oil revenues and the other resources from Scotland they make use of. How are they going to cope when we've left? 
453 2018-09-11 23:03:05 But who will berate me for parking in front of a superbox on a public street? 

However will I get flyers for the 17 Chinese/Pizza/Vietnamese/Shawarma places that don't deliver to my house?

How will I know who has the cheapest oil change in my Quadrant?
454 2018-09-11 23:03:03 We budged it a lot with oil and using floss after icing it, then took that all off and she used cold soapy water to get it all the way off. Took a bit of time, I was getting ready to take her in lol I’m glad it worked out
455 2018-09-11 23:03:01 honestly i don’t think it lives up to the hype...the second ingredient is mineral oil & even tho i’m a pale olive i’m still olive so it really only serves me in the dead of winter plus the smell is kinda old ladyish. i much prefer tatcha the water cream.
456 2018-09-11 23:02:45 Oil going mad and nar a new pipeline to be seen. Shame.
457 2018-09-11 23:02:30 1.) Stop Russia & China from building pipelines for oil & CNG  through Afghanistan to Iran 

2.) Control the opium fields

3.) Establish  permanent military presence

459 2018-09-11 23:02:18 Its happening everywhere. In my hometown, Temerloh the police will come once in a month just to collect money. And they will come back for more if they need more. In estate and oil palm field

465 2018-09-11 23:01:46 Oil prices +2% Tuesday as U.S. sanctions squeezed Iranian crude exports & after U.S. crude production in 2019 was forecast to grow at a slower rate than previously expected.
466 2018-09-11 23:01:41 @SFTOYOTA where $185 or $187 is the magic number. Need to do service, my two year anniversary just passed. DARN! Oil change $187? HUH?? My tailgate won't open as normal - Please agree to pay $187 for us to check it.  HUH? Yes.. my 2016 #ToyotaTacoma is still under warranty. #sad
467 2018-09-11 23:01:34 It would've been logical, IF Gumtaj demands for the items she wants, insisting on separate cooking with different oil & ingredients. She did not, right?
Why the risk?

Gumtaj claiming to "adjust" to allergies is just embarrassingly reeking of lies

472 2018-09-11 23:01:11 The government of Barbados has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Alicia Silverstone in a cambric wig.
473 2018-09-11 23:00:53 So, you don't have data then. Chomsky as always is talking rubbish. Socialism took down the richest country in South America.Production of oil (state-owned) went down 2 million barrels per day. Now, they are very close to not being able to lay the bonds the government have issued

476 2018-09-11 23:00:42 And yet we hear no talk about this by the ANDP during its time in office, no attempt to interact with social movements that would help the fight. We see attacks on indigenous people & extreme language in defense of oil companies!

482 2018-09-11 22:59:48 US stocks have risen with Apple leading a jump in technology shares as a gain of more than two per cent in oil prices drove up energy shares. 

Apple rose 2.5 per cent on Tuesday, boosting the three major indexes, a day ahead of its expected unveiling of new iPhone models.

486 2018-09-11 22:59:11 Really Nikki.Who are you kitting?Please.EVERYONE knows that the massive bulliyng against Venezuela is because the USA wants to take the BIGGEST OIL RESERVE OF THE PLANET. So, you can continue with the FAKE NEWS about anything at all about Venezuela. You will talk to yourself gal.
487 2018-09-11 22:59:08 I like him. I like how birds like him. But I don’t think he’s going to change his approach at this stage of life. It’s a shame because if we could get ideals AND facts together that would be potent. Like Trudeau, if he weren’t willing to sell some of the ideals to oil companies.
488 2018-09-11 22:58:58 Indeed it wasn’t, but to ignore the current social circumstances is foolish. The average Albertan has had 40yrs of corporate brainwashing against socialism, resulting in a populace willing to go to bat for the oil barons. It’s not just the corporations the ANDP is fighting
489 2018-09-11 22:58:58 I like oil, nuclear energy & the advantages & benefits those technologies have brought to mankind.

496 2018-09-11 22:57:51 It’s just like turning an oil tanker. This is just the second stage of our disengagement with the EU political project. A50 started it, March 19 will be the next step.

529 2018-09-11 22:54:36 The ANDP will wail about their one-term experience by pointing to the deep control the oil industry has (the source of that conservatism - it wasn't always so conservative!), without ever having broached this during their time in office.

559 2018-09-11 22:50:27 Drove past a Jiffy Lube advertising the return of their “Pumpkin Spice Oil Change, just in time for fall” and this seemed like something @edsbs needed to be aware of. Pumpkin Spice Oil Changes for everyone!

“What a beautiful specimen. This species is a rare nogenderus fluidis; they come out quite often during the school year. Mostly innofensive to man, they feed on free speech which they refer to as “fascism”. A true wonder of Mother Nature!

563 2018-09-11 22:50:09 why did I go to wal -mart to get my oil changed 
564 2018-09-11 22:49:56 Our prayers continue for the Oil Never Sleeps Gang! Keep up the good work!
565 2018-09-11 22:49:56 My momma really text me saying if i drink castor oil don’t talk to her no more 
566 2018-09-11 22:49:42 @Studio10au @Joe_Hildebrand @SarahHarris @AngelaBishop Hildebrand. He'll be bringing up oil soon. #Studio10 Hilarious!
567 2018-09-11 22:49:39 Oh, I didn’t know she was on the View. Idk what ever happened to Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
568 2018-09-11 22:49:32 been applying coconut oil on my body continuously every time it’s absorbed for say 3-4 days. it made a difference ladies. do same me do.

570 2018-09-11 22:49:08 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
571 2018-09-11 22:49:02 Hopefully the med process won't be too drawn out for you! If I could offer any advice, it would be to research CBD oil, and edibles, before allowing the 'professional's' to push the opioid's! After 10 year's,  I'm still only managing my pain, while my spine turns to dust!!
572 2018-09-11 22:48:53 Tea tree oil is the way to go!
573 2018-09-11 22:48:48 OIL PASTEL PAHIRAM POOOO

576 2018-09-11 22:48:31 Brought my car to get its oil changed, I’m truly adulting
577 2018-09-11 22:48:25 Spilled an essential oil bottle and got it all over my hands and now I want to die
578 2018-09-11 22:48:24 I would argue that they have been pursuing a different agenda. Alberta made the most progressive carbon pricing scene in Canada, invested in diversification of its economy, and complied with federal standards. The NDP realizes that it has to use oil revenues to diversify
579 2018-09-11 22:48:23 Just on pause till IndyRef has passed.
The predictability of oil off and on again with IndyRef on and off is getting monotenous.
So is the reporting of it.

582 2018-09-11 22:48:03 @LBC Don't you dear tell families like ours what is fair Tom.... Your propaganda does more harm with your lies.. Blair sent my cousin to die on lies to protect oil and soldiers Now guard poppy fields in Afghanistan....

584 2018-09-11 22:47:56 i use tea tree oil pretty much everyday  i just don’t know what to do anymore
585 2018-09-11 22:47:55 I got some new beard oil that will help you out next time you grow it out, so don’t worry
586 2018-09-11 22:47:52 You really want to risk cocktails made of beer, eggs and olive oil? Good luck with that... 
587 2018-09-11 22:47:31 I ordered curry from a restaurant I’ve ordered from a few times & when I got it, it looked super oily & weird so I brought it back (which I never do) & they were rude & told me to just scrape the oil off & microwave it lol this is why I never complain about my food being wrong 
588 2018-09-11 22:47:25 Also McDonalds fish isn't really halal as they fry it in the same oil as all other products therefor it can't be halal because of cross contamination
589 2018-09-11 22:47:22 i have straight cbd oil and it kinda works it just feels weird cause you don’t get high but feel somewhat relaxed
590 2018-09-11 22:47:15 Now they are telling Mom vitamin E and fish oil, whatever, as long as I still get my treats 
591 2018-09-11 22:47:10 Note to self: never leave my flat without my lavender essential oil ever again.
592 2018-09-11 22:46:49 The only decent Candian Province is Alberta. Keep your Tar Sands oil, sell it to Russia, the cannot process it anyway. Your PM Ms. J. Trudeau is using Chemtrails in all of Canada now, your climate will get much worse. Looks like no US Trade for you guys.
593 2018-09-11 22:46:49 No secret. The Dems hate Christians so they love Islam. The Bushie GOP gets rich off Saudi oil. Marriage made in hell

595 2018-09-11 22:46:30 I’m going to try CBD oil soon. The GP-prescribed meds made me too spaced out.
596 2018-09-11 22:46:27 yeah I definitely check the commissions tab all the time, but it's still not as bad as an AP bar or something similar IMO since you can buy dorm snacks with your spare oil instead
597 2018-09-11 22:46:24 We'll talk about the amount later.
But that oil in the Beans is A Gift.

600 2018-09-11 22:45:32 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
601 2018-09-11 22:45:30 I think that there are a lot of benefits to using marijuana and other cannabis products. I myself went from being heavily medicated, struggling with addiction because of it, to using only prescribed anti depressants & CBD oil.
602 2018-09-11 22:45:21 Could have done with this a few years ago, a significant oil spill near my home covered 3 streets, was like walking on ice let alone riding on it. Solicitor pulled out despite me giving evidence of photos and bus timetables. I was V angry, to late to start with another solicitor.
603 2018-09-11 22:45:19 Opportunity to ruin an oil block
604 2018-09-11 22:45:10 If the NDP wants to use that as an excuse (and undoubtedly it will if it loses next year), they have to come to terms with their total capitulation, with their unwillingness to even state that the oil industry runs things and they were just doing their best given circumstances.

610 2018-09-11 22:44:43 Hate having to change your oil every 2-3 thousand miles? Just get yourself a car like mine that leaks so much oil that you have to fill it with oil every few weeks. Problem solved.
611 2018-09-11 22:44:36 Different restaurants have different procedures, as for I know the one near my house in Leeds fry fish + chips separate from the meat. And use grape seed oil or summet like that, however when I went Newcastle I asked and I got told they use the same fryer for meat + fish + chips
612 2018-09-11 22:44:30 canned tuna in oil is admittedly not for everyone, but was a GAME-CHANGER for me. I can't and won't go back!!

618 2018-09-11 22:43:42 Got to spend time with my dad while running errands. Got my passport photo done, picking up my friend’s newly delivered phone, and currently getting an oil change/car wash.

620 2018-09-11 22:43:39 we offered an organic pesticide/fungicide to the epa but because it has hemp oil it in, they consider it harmful....
621 2018-09-11 22:43:16 the car used 3576kwh to complete the trip, at grid prices Thats about a third of  the price of oil based fuel.

625 2018-09-11 22:42:53 You are apparently taking too much green propoganda as fact. The oilsands on an emissions basis are cleaner than oil sourced from California and far cleaner than Nigeria, Russia and Venezuela. When you see the import tankers coming into the St Lawrence, remember this.
626 2018-09-11 22:42:35 i wish you could speak against your govt who planned all this Drama just to occupy oil resources in Iraq
627 2018-09-11 22:42:27 BigOil and the Koch-bastards are getting their pace up.

629 2018-09-11 22:42:11 How about we get the hell out of there altogether. Or how about looking at it from this standpoint, we are a thorn in Syrias side. We are there for one reason, to try and control oil and gas reserves. There is no other reason. Fighting ISIS? BS. we've been backing them.
630 2018-09-11 22:41:59 Honestly apart from oil and exporting vahabi jihadis ideology have your country offered anything to the world? Just name some of your kings or scholars or scientist? Don't mention Osama bin Laden please hehe

637 2018-09-11 22:41:13  enjoy ur lefty socialist greeny utopia. Our investments in shale, oil, coal & retail energy r performing magnificently & will continue to do so under good governance by non lefties
638 2018-09-11 22:41:02 Not for anything but the best thing for the U.S. political realm would be if @POTUS stimulated alternative energy sources to become independent of oil. Don't allow the current oil rich to become the investors make them vulnerable where it hurt's... in their pocket.

646 2018-09-11 22:40:24 And if it's margarine (very likely for the whipped butter toppings on pancakes so it melts better) then it's got amounts of vegetable oil in it instead of just milkfat, which also is colorless. :)
647 2018-09-11 22:40:23 @VinnieTortorich I bought the 1 oz bottles you suggest on Amazon. How do you get the olive oil into those tiny bottles?!
648 2018-09-11 22:40:20 Sure, just like Saddam had chemical, biological and nuclear weapons poised to strike America. We all know what's really going on. Having nearly run out of Middle Eastern oil nations to invade, the US is now turning its sights on Russia.

659 2018-09-11 22:39:05 @richardquest 
I believe that the majority of the gains in the US economy are substantially direct result of shale oil production started a decade ago and it's spin offs.   Not as a result of gov policies. I would be very interested in a segment exploring that idea.
660 2018-09-11 22:38:53 Non-level stovetops should be a crime. I don't want the oil pooling at one side of the skillet. It's ridiculous.
661 2018-09-11 22:38:52 God, I wish they were actually slightly communist...  but at this point in Alberta, the oil industry controls the province, not the government itself.  It's been like this since before the NDP even came into power.  Alberta is the neoliberal hell center of our great nation.
662 2018-09-11 22:38:51 Dill, sea salt and olive oil and cracked pepper and olive oil are S.E.X
663 2018-09-11 22:38:50 @VinnieTortorich hi Vinnie, I heard you say on the @AdamCarollaShow we should have olive oil every day. How much should I have? any brand you recommend that I can find in a store to hold me off until I get the one you recommend on your show?
664 2018-09-11 22:38:45 Well who do you know? Do you like coconut oil?
665 2018-09-11 22:38:30 EIA tomorrow will show much lower oil draw.  About half of API. We will know soon enough.  I hope I am wrong!!!!
666 2018-09-11 22:38:29 Just because Olive oil and buffalo milk is different to here becomes special preferences eh?? Ghee pickle is necessity aaakum??

667 2018-09-11 22:38:25 The war we went into @proud_infidel had nothing to do with 9/11 or terrorist attacks. We were lied to by the Bush administration to go get the oil in Iraq and get Saddam Hussein. and you my be a "proud" infidel but you are cowardly by hiding behind an assumed identity.
668 2018-09-11 22:38:22 George W put us in a war over the petrodollar with Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction was a total lie to sell it to Congress and America. Sadam and Khaddafi both were threatening to not accept petrodollars for their oil but gold and that’s why they are both dead.

675 2018-09-11 22:37:04 Like, it's sorta felt like that Notley was forcibly corralled into supporting the oil industry like this or face political suicide.  It's just a shame that despite her sucking up to neoliberal forces, she is still slandered and called a """communist""" by right wing media.
676 2018-09-11 22:36:39 ! do u just use the straight oil like i notice there’s also like extracts/pills/vapes etc.

685 2018-09-11 22:35:40 Hey Alberta, simple idea, it’s time we built refineries vs fighting over pipelines. I’ll vote for a politician who will commit to a refinery project that takes bitumen to premium gasoline. We have pure condy, clean fuel gas and as much heavy oil required. #simple #protectalberta
686 2018-09-11 22:35:31 아니 내 이미지가 뭔데...
687 2018-09-11 22:34:57 a lot the time people who sell carts (vape pens) where i live will put k2 in the cart instead of oil because its cheaper, thats how they are smoking it
688 2018-09-11 22:34:50 It wasn't that long ago that Peak Oil supply was all the rage. The directional change in sentiment is what's surprising.

691 2018-09-11 22:34:31 Coconut oil, avacado oil, castor oil according to scientists Lmao. Or certain shampoo
692 2018-09-11 22:34:20 No my bad-that was 8000 jet fuel dumped --not oil.
693 2018-09-11 22:34:19 I went to Five Guys with my siblings the other day & little did I know that they cook with peanut oil. Sooooo my face is breaking out.
694 2018-09-11 22:34:14 waiter and oil
695 2018-09-11 22:34:06 Nah. Still spreads just fine. Real PB doesn't have oil - added or naturally created - and it's a thinner consistency.
696 2018-09-11 22:33:59 People at this 5 minute oil change place I go to be cool as hell. Makes the experience that much better after a long day of work
697 2018-09-11 22:33:54 expected benefits to consumers didn't materialize on same scale as drag on US investment/ global drag from oil exporters cutting back. US consumption didn't jump up (in hindsight b/c it was growing really fast in 14) and China, which in theory got a windfall, had its own problems
698 2018-09-11 22:33:54 There is NOTHING like an old fashioned beard trim 

That pre shave oil 
That hot towel
That shaving cream 
That feeling when the razor drags across your face 
That cold towel 
That after shave 

Yes I just had a spiritual experience in a barber’s chair
699 2018-09-11 22:33:28 They do it with the oil industry (Nalcor and the C-NLOPB). That does not make it right. But we seem to turn a blind eye to it all.

701 2018-09-11 22:33:01 My tummy hurt this afternoon so I just added olive oil and a roller ball to my Young Living DiGize bottle and I am feeling better!

703 2018-09-11 22:32:46 On 9/11 I was 16yrs old and had skipped school that day. Flipping through the channels I put it on the news just before the 2nd plane hit. I was glued the rest of the day. Rumors circled that a local oil refinery had been evacuated. We're a small Eastern KY community on the... 1/

707 2018-09-11 22:32:34 8000 gallons of jet oil dumped in Indiana? That was on Paul Begley this morning -who else reported this news?
708 2018-09-11 22:32:26 What is it? 
709 2018-09-11 22:32:18 Just eggplant, cream cheese, Colby Jack and olive oil seared chicken.
710 2018-09-11 22:32:11 Those cowards are trying to rid Idlib of foreign militants who are funded by the west.  America is trying to prolong the Idlib situation because al Assad is coming for the SDF east of the Euphrates River.  You know, where all the oil is...that’s why America is really there.
711 2018-09-11 22:32:08 Hi I’m getting my oil changed & my phone is at 7% my day could literally not get any worse
712 2018-09-11 22:32:03 Your rhetoric is in contrast to your actions. From Day 1 you have been against oil/ gas. From the royalty review, to hiring anti-oil activists, to a carbon tax, all speak loudly to your position.
713 2018-09-11 22:32:02 Y’all really needed over an hour to change my oil????

715 2018-09-11 22:31:58 @narendramodi its really miserable to see we are helpless we can't take oil from Iran,
we can't bow to some bigger country like USA .Find some solution sir ,
You are my Hero sir.
716 2018-09-11 22:31:57 Looks like you guys are good at approving self storage construction and oil extraction!!  The future looks bright in Broomfield!  :)

721 2018-09-11 22:31:15 Lenoard has put motor oil into the power steering fluid port of the car. Wtf. Okay grrrrr. All that has to be removed and cleaned and new power steering fluid has to be added. Oh holy fuck. Dude I know your 84 but let us do this Shit

730 2018-09-11 22:30:19 Nobody's buying this twaddle. Canada is just picking up the table scraps of a vibrant American economy + decent oil prices, otherwise this country would be in recession. US GDP 4.2%, CDN 2.1%, US jobless 3.9%, CDN jobless 6.0. Most F/T CDN jobs R public sector, US mostly private

736 2018-09-11 22:29:43 I feel the Academy's constant money/oil thing will drag me into checking often but yeah reasonably chill especially because auto can do all the farming for me lol
737 2018-09-11 22:29:42 Can you please forward the information (news article) of when did the Vajpayee govt issue oil bonds and for how much (how much did Congress have to pay back?)...
738 2018-09-11 22:29:42 Blimperator Furiosa
739 2018-09-11 22:29:41 Yeah, although oil tanking should have helped global consumers, but probably would have taken a year or better to flow through.  Both another China slowdown and higher oil prices has me a bit concerned about the future.
740 2018-09-11 22:29:38 Na your wahala wow if you let him skim Lagos the same way skimmed AP (Forte Oil)
741 2018-09-11 22:29:33 This will probably surprise you. In 2009, when the PCs were in power, our unemployment was 15.5%. In 2010 - 14.7%. And that was when oil was good. /js
742 2018-09-11 22:29:30 New new!! 36x36 original oil on canvas!! Still a little wet 
743 2018-09-11 22:29:28 I did a oil change alone and it felt great
744 2018-09-11 22:29:09 I'm waiting for 12 before I go and drop egg and palm oil at T Junction..we must blow
745 2018-09-11 22:29:05 Typically B12 deficiency which is rarely related to not getting enough of it in a meat eater. It's inflammation in the distal Illeum that prevents the B12 from being absorbed. Probably do to sugar, grain, seed oil and many different plants.
746 2018-09-11 22:29:05 yeah the iraq war was just a oil grab/waste of US life and unnecessary loss of all middle east lives as well
747 2018-09-11 22:28:53 Tea tree oil is a godsend
748 2018-09-11 22:28:41 Mariota couldn’t hit the side of Lucas oil stadium if he was standing 3 feet away from it. Running QB’s don’t survive unless your name is Vick. He’s in the right system especially with dirk not calling the offense
749 2018-09-11 22:28:35 It’s impossible to overstate how shortsighted gop greed is
It’s beyond mind boggling
They know how to make money in ONE way (oil & plastics)
If that one way damns the entire planet to suffocation & death - so be it. Make that money. Live for today.
750 2018-09-11 22:28:19 I gotta schedule a oil change for my car. Last time I smoked a fat ass blunt and left a clip plus a half in my car and they serviced it he goes “nice fucking perfume dude” 
751 2018-09-11 22:28:10 Do you mean, “Oil Slick”?
752 2018-09-11 22:27:40 Respect to the Valvoline location with the sign proclaiming:

753 2018-09-11 22:27:30 Thank you. Damn near thought I got sold snake oil at this point
754 2018-09-11 22:27:29 Well, I just dropped off the car for an oil change, so instead of sitting on the uncomfortable waiting room chairs, I’m out walking laps around Walmart while they get that taken care of. #WalWalking #HealthyChoices #GetYoStepsIn
755 2018-09-11 22:27:22 @RussellKBrett These are some companies that are behind Telmex. They need a more robust conformation, several sectors.   Bronco Drilling, Cilsa, GSM, PC Construcciones, Urvitec,Carso Energy, Carso Oil & Gas, Carso Electric
756 2018-09-11 22:27:13 No he’s in Eastern Europe or something building harems and selling olive oil.
757 2018-09-11 22:27:12 So we attacked a country that didn't do it because they nationlized their oil pissing off the country that did do it.
758 2018-09-11 22:27:04 heavy like crude oil? or the green stuff u smoke. 
Iran only country that stand against Saudi cult. and last line of defense against ISIS... now lick this.

759 2018-09-11 22:26:59 You are very wicked 
You are killing English speakers of Cameroon
You will never take their oil
760 2018-09-11 22:26:56 Hey look we support these places by buying their oil. Whoo hoo!
761 2018-09-11 22:26:53 Yes tree oil.
762 2018-09-11 22:26:52 I just took my cbd oil so I am really sleepy so hopefully I can fall asleep and if someone invades our house Ill be so asleep I wont even notice. I hope it turns on quickly for your peace of mind. We are all standing together x
763 2018-09-11 22:26:51 Kingsley is comparing Atiku to Otedola? I can't, I just can't.

It is Otedola that has been advocating for restructuring since 2007/08. It is Otedola that shared his vision for restructuring from his Forte Oil HQ.

I simply do not know how to put mouth and engage in such a debate
764 2018-09-11 22:26:47 TAN was mostly oil marketers & subsidy beneficiaries. Corporate Nigeria was the real deal Dangote, Otedola, Banks etc Transcorp was the end result of that union(PDP + Corporate Nig)
765 2018-09-11 22:26:39 It certainly is, I read that it took 4 years to make and they used 65,000 oil paintings
766 2018-09-11 22:26:36 i got an oil change, a car wash, and a new battery. a nice day for my car
767 2018-09-11 22:26:27 I’m about to make olive oil today too and use it for my carbonara tonight!
768 2018-09-11 22:26:25 @narendramodi sir i think you should decrease burden on us , every year peoples filing taxes is increasing why not it is possible to decrease oil price its too much. why not these oil companies who are the most profitable company should have electric charging stations.
769 2018-09-11 22:26:11 And if ya 5head ain’t shiny from oil and sweat
770 2018-09-11 22:26:09 Mr Robertson ,I believe in the power of prayer, But sir you are not a messenger of God .But instead a snake oil salesmen,that profits off the poor that you make believe,that only through you and Trump all will be well....
771 2018-09-11 22:26:06 Alrighty then  ... Just kindly let me know what are we buying when the shoosting begins, we'll do 50/50 (after CGT off course) ... 
Last stunt was $OIL etc. and whatever they cooking this time ... 
772 2018-09-11 22:26:04 Just listened to a series of speakers at the Oil Sands Conference. Production expanding. Technology is driving emissions down. Costs going down. Millions of $ for Treaty 8 First Nations for health, education, long term care. FN STRONGLY supportive.
773 2018-09-11 22:25:53 So Teddy, big oil are your constituents ??? I’m confused, aren’t you supposed to represent, you know, all Texans ... pretty sure that’s what @BetoORourke is going to do ...

775 2018-09-11 22:25:45 What oil did we grab
776 2018-09-11 22:25:44 Just heard @realDonaldTtrump's EPA relaxed inspection rules for methane gas leaks on oil rigs from 6mos to 12mos inspections & 3mos to 6mos for repairs. Isn't methane combustible?
@CNN

What do you think?
777 2018-09-11 22:25:39 I had a mini , once it began to leak oil , it became more trouble than it was worth. I now have a certified pre owned Mercedes E350 . LOVE IT! The cost was reasonable compared to a new car , the maintenance had a 2 year deal ,
778 2018-09-11 22:25:37 Alpha Lipoic Acid, coconut oil, Liposomal Glutathione, Collagen
779 2018-09-11 22:25:26 You mean like both at the same time? As tempting as it may be, the idea of exposing myself in front of hot oil sounds like an invitation for disaster
780 2018-09-11 22:25:19 Friends, Ford is a snake oil salesman peddling sound bites while working for his own pocket using scaremongering and sound bites to fool those gullible enough while supported by the low moral PC's who simply want power by any means for their own ends. #fordcircus
781 2018-09-11 22:25:18 I'm not as against Afganistan as I was/am Iraq. That was a squabble between oil men and spawned ISIS. They made it up.

783 2018-09-11 22:24:54 Just afg the Middle East has oil but isn’t afg in Asia ?
784 2018-09-11 22:24:37 NOT remembering the attacks that happened SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO. Due to the overwhelming documents that pointed to USA's self-harm and attacks on another country over OIL AND RESOURCES. So #fuckwar and #makeloveNOTwar is what I go by. *Theorists know it. I'm not one of 'em.
785 2018-09-11 22:24:35 So, oil basically? Difficult to mine, limited supply, controlled by a few key players, and questionable worth in a rapidly evolving world?
786 2018-09-11 22:24:30 That is absolutely nothing compared to the investigations coming for 'potus' and congress, namely mitch and chao.  They lifted the Jones Act so Russia could drill for oil off of Cuba but dragged their asses for Puerto Rico.  ALL trump's pals' companies made millions as PR died.
787 2018-09-11 22:24:28 Ingredients like sugar, palm oil, hydrogenated fats? No shortage of this crap to make their ‘chocolate’ recipe aka ‘paste’.  I think we can all live without paste. Loads of artisan  chocolate out there. Hotel Chocolate shops everywhere.
788 2018-09-11 22:24:24 @CONDESCENDANT I don't know how many times I quoted Leonardo Maugeri's report to Harvard on the impacts of shale and his predictions around the collapse of oil. I lost count on how many times I pushed that. Sorry to disappoint you!...
789 2018-09-11 22:24:22 Been using the miracle drops on my eyebrows for about a month now... doesn’t grow as fast as castor oil, but the castor oil gave me pimples !!! Which I never get

791 2018-09-11 22:24:05 this is gonna sound weird but, i decided to cut out all unwanted fats with my meal plan so that meant i couldn’t use normal mayo on my sandwiches so i did avocado oil mayo instead and it was the best thing of my life 
792 2018-09-11 22:24:03 If it’s not call point s aka dicks and tell them they need to come put oil in it and if the motors fucked they have to pay for it
793 2018-09-11 22:23:54 It’s tragic indeed, none should have die in that way.However,the thousand of people who have die in the Middle East due toWestern interventions for Power&Control of the Oil & natural resources,what?The Western Colonialism has killed more people tha 9/11. But none Cares! SHAMEFUL

797 2018-09-11 22:23:20 Elite pump fakes are people who get in a 15 minute oil change line and decide to get every service imaginable done. Bro did you forget the toothbrush scrub on the rims too?
798 2018-09-11 22:23:12 I got rid of mine exfoliating, rose water, aloe vera gel, tea tree oil and Aztec clay.
799 2018-09-11 22:23:11 throw in the forced contraction in the imports of the oil exporters if you want as well.  big real drag in 15 ...
800 2018-09-11 22:23:11 You don’t get out much do you. Sunset industry?  Perhaps check the reports from the IEA that indicate global oil demand is expected to RISE until at least 2040. As long as population continues to increase and the middle class keeps expanding, demand will increase.
801 2018-09-11 22:23:04 @ATT Estas son algunas empresas que están detrás de Telmex necesitan una competencia mas robusta GSM, PC Construcciones, Urvitec,Carso Energy, Carso Oil & Gas, Carso Electric.
802 2018-09-11 22:23:04 What was your first beauty community (YouTube) drama? Was it Subculture? Was it anything to do with a brand? An influencer? I wanna know! My first “drama” was when Jeffree Star and Laura Lee reviewed the unicorn oil crap! That news actually is what brought me into this community!
803 2018-09-11 22:22:51 "The snake oil salesman's job isn't to cure disease or improve health. His job is to sell you that oil. This will remind you that you such ailments CAN be remedied. How? We're not sure, but unlike the DNC, we're doing our part by selling you snake oil."

Yeah, I want my $25 back.

805 2018-09-11 22:22:10 .@PBS the trump regime is efficiently dismantling our environmental regs because the agencies have been handed over to oil industry lobbyists, to run and undo everything they can.

836 2018-09-11 22:18:40 A little oil maybe.
837 2018-09-11 22:18:23 Is #DGOC predominantly oil or gas? I've never looked at it closely.

840 2018-09-11 22:18:03 Forgive me, ghost of Julia Child - I used a butter/olive oil blend to make sole meunière.
841 2018-09-11 22:18:02 There’s your problem check your oil make sure it’s full
842 2018-09-11 22:18:01 Oil. Exactly
843 2018-09-11 22:18:00 salt n olive oil for sure also never heard of pep
844 2018-09-11 22:17:25 it’s the stark fundamental difference between a statesman and a snake oil salesman. even if his assessment wasn’t a lie - and it is - a leader stokes the fires of inspiration to do the work that still lies ahead. they don’t congratulate themselves. the man’s a goblin.
845 2018-09-11 22:16:54 Obviously if Oil can keep rising, #DGOC will probably rise with it. ShareScope showing Fwd Divvy of 8%.
846 2018-09-11 22:16:52 You may have to refresh it with water/conditioner/oil

849 2018-09-11 22:16:27 In syria America only fighting for to steel and robe syrian oil. America don't care a bit about any muslims ever. Ok. This is the true fact. Ok

852 2018-09-11 22:16:06 Of course they don't want to win, like Boris, give and farage....
They can't win because their dreams are unworkable, as soon as fthey meet the realities of the  21st century all their dreams fall to pieces...
They are all either snake oil salesmen. Deluded or both.
853 2018-09-11 22:15:57 The rotten apple doesn’t fall far from the rotten @realDonaldTrump tree. @DonaldJTrumpJr is as self- absorbed & arrogant as @POTUS. Snake oil salesmen. @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan America deserves a whole lot better. #VoteTrumpOut
854 2018-09-11 22:15:51 Na so many people dey dive ebter hot oil
855 2018-09-11 22:15:40 Yes, I checked her oil 
856 2018-09-11 22:15:37 For some reason I find it amplifies the flavour  Idk if it's the oil that gets hot or what but it still tastes good. Maybe try it our with just a handful of chips and and some cheese then see if you like it. I too was skeptical before discovering one I'd my fav new snacks

860 2018-09-11 22:15:22 Lmao Caleb is on the phone with Landers to get my recall done & he also asked about how much an oil change would be & they said $86.79  NOPE!
861 2018-09-11 22:15:20 Have you checked your oil?
862 2018-09-11 22:15:19 Abegii 
Nothing is getting real. It’s just Oil tycoons trying to get oil blocs
863 2018-09-11 22:15:18 #TwinTowers Bush did it to have a reason to invade Arab countries for their oil. Same as pearl harbor- the USA deactivated pearl harbor's defenses so that Japan attacked easier and then the USA were able to enter the war
864 2018-09-11 22:15:15 lmao look dude, if I'm seriously implementing socialism I wouldn't peg my currency to oil prices for a start, but honestly I expected better of you than just 'VENEZUELA!'. you have answered nothing I've asked. literally all I want is a couple of citations.
865 2018-09-11 22:15:11 The condition taking place in Venuezuela is a prime example that socialism can not work. Yesterday, that country was an oil rich thriving nation, today, many there can barely afford to buy toilet paper. Don’t be deceived.
866 2018-09-11 22:15:06 my understanding is cbd oil, ....but idk....

877 2018-09-11 22:13:27 The tea is Bin Laden (and Bush, who was in cahoots with Saudi royalty) won. Americans took every inch of his bait by invading Afghanistan & Iraq because attacking Saudi Arabia would’ve meant losing oil, and now America is governed by someone ideologically identical to Bin Laden.
878 2018-09-11 22:13:26 The oregano oil is the best thing since sliced bread. Four drops in a teaspoon of olive poured over milk. I’ve cleared up everything from a dry cough to an viral enteritis with it. It’s my Windex.
879 2018-09-11 22:13:24 My night time/post make-up cleansing routine is:

881 2018-09-11 22:13:08 I always thought Oil Drum Lane was based on the back streets off of Wood Lane across the road from the BBC Television Centre in what was the original White City. I grew up not far away in Pennard Road and well remember seeing rag and bone men and horse drawn coal carts.
882 2018-09-11 22:13:07 They would profit much more if they go to war with Iraq, Iraq has over billions of dollars worth of oil. Yea but school is useless tbh.
883 2018-09-11 22:13:06 i went to get an oil change and they gave me a cup of strawberries & pineapple thanks guys
884 2018-09-11 22:13:04 9/11 was an inside done by the U.S. government as a reason to invade Afghanistan for oil. Even though the government knew Bin Laden was in Saudi Arbia. Also where was the Flight 93 rubble. Plus Bin Ladden was dying a kidney failure
885 2018-09-11 22:12:59 If you really loved your children you would more concerned with the EPA! Trump would rather give the oil and gas industry $484M instead of reducing greenhouse gases!!! You and your family will be blamed for destroying the planet!!!
886 2018-09-11 22:12:59 リクエストは受け付けないぜ！
887 2018-09-11 22:12:54 Not just oil. 
There are bad actors making tons of $$$ off of the actual conflicts. 
War is expensive. Someone profits.
888 2018-09-11 22:12:53 It’s a false scarcity of resources that’s driving up the prices artificially. Controlled like gold and oil prices.

889 2018-09-11 22:12:41 What is so big about getting off oil anyway. No one wanted it to begin with. No one voted for it. It just appeared.
890 2018-09-11 22:12:37 Need to get some tea tree oil 
891 2018-09-11 22:12:32 Why not privatise and have a state run oil company!! Sod it, bread can vary in prices too, let’s give the workers the means of production and give it all away. You plank!
892 2018-09-11 22:12:26 Bullsnot, another snake oil sales campaign!
893 2018-09-11 22:11:58 It’s all good. Some sound wave therapy and some shockwave thingy seems to be doing the job. Had a look on amazon for some snake oil but couldn’t find any.
894 2018-09-11 22:11:52 @ailahkai HEY do you have a preferred reliable shop for oils? I'm trying to buy quality rosehip seed oil for my face and I see it in a lot of online shops. or if there's anywhere locally you prefer?
895 2018-09-11 22:11:35 I believe the school you went to invented crude oil.

897 2018-09-11 22:11:14 Dawn dish soap is strong enough to remove oil from ducks, yet not strong enough to remove this hot cheeto dust from my fingers...
898 2018-09-11 22:11:06 I tried lavender and spearmint in my oil diffuser last night I slept like a baby. I was in bed and in REM before 10. And it was the way God intended to be honest
899 2018-09-11 22:10:58 I take mine too Honda and they didn't put oil back in last time. I can't prove it but I had to put in three quarts and my car doesn't leak. They are going to hear about it next time I go.
900 2018-09-11 22:10:29 I hate anyone who can fold them...

907 2018-09-11 22:10:17 My friend admitted to me that she’s been giving her husband coconut oil & Rogaine scalp massages because she noticed his hair getting thin last year. 
908 2018-09-11 22:10:17 Georgia for Georgians ? And u know after Russian aggression in 90-93 from abkhazia and samachablo  (south osethia) all Georgians it's 400k people's was must leave there historical homes. 
Europeans have no balls. For gas and oil European Union can sold there mom's or s***k Russia
909 2018-09-11 22:10:12 But yeah.. I also think so too.. They tried to bomb the foundation of the building couple years prior but it's all go to do with oil in the middle east and other factors that we are not aware of and probably wont be.
910 2018-09-11 22:10:04 Endless oil story

915 2018-09-11 22:09:33 The "Lifting Cost" of a barrel of Oil is $15? Wow man... and selling at $79 - The Shareholders must be making a killing...especially if the Treasury is hardly taxing Shell and BP. 100% mismanagement of the Oil and Gas Revenues.
916 2018-09-11 22:09:28 I’ve just smothered my body in @NuxeUK dry oil, I feel slippery AND sexy
917 2018-09-11 22:09:23 Now I have to go and get an oil change 
918 2018-09-11 22:09:10 I use the water soluble. It has the same specs. Gotta be careful, there are a lot of snake oil types out there.
919 2018-09-11 22:08:51 Diet was 8% protein, 90% fat - fat was lard (30% LA) and safflower oil (60% LA).
Too low in protein and too high in LA, which tumours can use to promote angiogenesis.
920 2018-09-11 22:08:49 What’s a good beard oil? I ran out of tea tree oil 
921 2018-09-11 22:08:36 I remember the days when Obama was POTUS and there was no predatory lending or pollution.  Remember when he let that oil rig flow for days on end while letting BP take care of it?  If Trump had done that he would be Satan.
922 2018-09-11 22:08:29 People will still need oil post brexit, have you not seen Mad Max?

928 2018-09-11 22:08:01 I am on CBD Oil. My dad is in hospital, my friend passed of cancer last week and I have severe PTSD after someone stalked me so Im not doing too great, so this is not helping. COT Should give me R700 because that is what the CBD cost me. But it helps so much. Really relaxes you.
929 2018-09-11 22:07:42 Why did I wash Helens feet tell em blood Jesus washed his apostles feet then I put oil on them like they did be HUMBLE

931 2018-09-11 22:07:31 Got my oil changed today and now i wanna go everywhere. I should drive home 
932 2018-09-11 22:07:31 Making some “zoodles” salted them to let the excess moisture out. 10-15 min later I’ll rinse them well then toss in a pan with a drizzle of olive oil till cooked and then top with some meat sauce!!!
933 2018-09-11 22:07:29 Just spent $250 on tires + balance & rotation and an oil change. 
934 2018-09-11 22:07:09 rightly so.. The best FAT that needs a lot of heating prior to oxidation  are:
1: Coconut Oil 2: Ghee 3:Butter 4: Olive oil... The rest oxidise very quickly n very bad for our health.. Readon I stick to CPCO and Ghee..
935 2018-09-11 22:07:07 Better vape more cannabis oil so I'm in the proper state of mind for writing.  Yes, I'll use any excuse I can find. 
936 2018-09-11 22:07:03 Thanks for that. Today’s oil patch workforce definitely can’t be pigeon holed into any personality or intellectual type(s).
937 2018-09-11 22:07:01 You would rather give oil and gas $484 Million than regulate the leading cause of Climate Change! The damage Hurricane Florence will do is due to the excessive heat in the oceans!!!!!
938 2018-09-11 22:07:01 I don't know the amounts compared to the oil price decline. I remember the time as my father had less work nearby and less pay for his work farther away in construction.

940 2018-09-11 22:06:49 Question: How many barrels of oil does Dingleberry Jr. go through in a week? Jesus Christ, if there were a spark near him he'd blow up the entire studio.
941 2018-09-11 22:06:46 I wonder what @jimcramer owns in his action alerts trust portfolio that has him so negative on Tesla? Big oil? Other automakers? Or just the fact that he works at CNBC aka FUD Central?! I mean his dogs name is Chevron...
942 2018-09-11 22:06:29 Also decries baby oil because it's made out of babies...
943 2018-09-11 22:06:23 Those oil wells are depleting faster than expected
944 2018-09-11 22:06:11 Can I just put it out there that cannabis oil will become legal for NHS to prescribe and the high ranking politicians and their associates will make money from producing it.
945 2018-09-11 22:05:55 But ur corruption is worse than ours how  can y'all have fuel shortage and u mine oil?  
946 2018-09-11 22:05:48 CIA loves a good patsy and Bin Laden was the key to attacking the very lands they desired to gain more control of the oil production. Look to the war in Kuwait you’ll get more clarity when understanding the evolution of this war

959 2018-09-11 22:04:26 Flip it over so its upside when storing it. All the oil will be at the bottom when you open it 
960 2018-09-11 22:04:20 To be honest isn't wasn't a particular good looking games at the time. It was very stiff with animation and movement. One of my all time favourites but it's no oil painting.

964 2018-09-11 22:03:38 Hmm... maybe I should buy some tomato sauce to mix things up since I eat a lot of pasta and I just use olive oil usually. But I have ravioli tonight and that's better with a thick sauce
965 2018-09-11 22:03:25 Your protocol is to self destruct United States economy so your friends on the outside can buy everything at the bottom. Once the stock markets crash from you shutting down Canada's Lumber and oil. Please believe me at this is his parachute retirement package

971 2018-09-11 22:02:23 Frankly they probably need to rethink that nominal level because I'm guessing that assumption was based on a much lower exchange rate than right now. Oil at $80 is cheaper when the Peso is at 35 than when it's at 55
972 2018-09-11 22:02:21 The problem with going to bed smothered in coconut oil is that It makes me smell like a bounty bar. And then that makes me what to eat one
973 2018-09-11 22:01:59 Really need my nails done. Also really need an oil change. Guess which one can wait?
974 2018-09-11 22:01:55 I do believe I said *number of ways* (and look at that, I’m right!), but I don’t think it’s been stated anywhere that the wealth being appropriated would be predominantly by seizing companies. And do you prefer state-run or private oil companies?
975 2018-09-11 22:01:44 They claimed this along with Basra Airport but I never really saw the US Consulate mentioned by any folks there nor did any local media write on it. Probably unfounded like the oil field hostage claim

979 2018-09-11 22:01:30 I believe the oil it's fried in , possible cross contamination , other unknown ingredients. God knows FAM. Best to stay away either way.
980 2018-09-11 22:01:19 行きましょ
981 2018-09-11 22:01:18 I named this one oil i got “pussy control”
982 2018-09-11 22:01:11 Not to mention the palm oil in carex...
983 2018-09-11 22:00:49 Price changes for Thursday. All data now in: Heating/stove oil to increase 1/10th of a cent a litre. Diesel fuel shows no changes. Gasoline shows a drop of 3.3 cents a litre. This is the "downside" of "Gordon" as supply disruptions fade. Canadian dollar steady. Brent hits $79US.
984 2018-09-11 22:00:48 Buy a bottle of MCT oil and use it whenever you drink any caffeine
985 2018-09-11 22:00:38 It's olive oil
986 2018-09-11 22:00:36 Not enough coconut oil available.
987 2018-09-11 22:00:35 It’s trash ass pasta for what you pay. Worked there for a few years. It’s so much smarter to buy the shit and make it yourself. 

And don’t get me started on the butter flavored oil used for the breadsticks. 
988 2018-09-11 22:00:33 You know what the secrets to great homemade pizza are? High heat, baking stone or steel, and about 3x as much high quality olive oil on the raw pizza as you think is too much. I put a whole mess both under the cheese and on top of the dresser pie and that totally helps.
989 2018-09-11 22:00:32 The dripping could be the a/c condenser which is just water, or it could be oil, or water dripping junk off the engine.  Sorry I'm nerding out on you.  Be safe.

992 2018-09-11 22:00:27 Also, the "terrorist attack" was used as justification to go to war to: 

1. Extract the ones that didn't comply with US demands.

2. Police the foreign countries while trying to steal/take control of the oil by pushing the "patriotism" propaganda to the troops.
993 2018-09-11 22:00:18 I thought he was day-trading the oil rally that started today. Lol!
994 2018-09-11 22:00:15 4 hours until my CBD Oil giveaway!! 
995 2018-09-11 21:59:56 Dude I got detained while covering these punks. There’s a straight up army in that academic building where they take arrestees. At least 50 state troopers in riot gear, fully automatic weapons, etc.
996 2018-09-11 21:59:29 Younggg I haaate to death dappin mf's wearing that oil shit 
997 2018-09-11 21:58:52 That’s wishful thinking. You have to pay for those cars. And you don’t pay for cars with the tax laws. They paid for those cars with oil money.
998 2018-09-11 21:58:48 We are only there for two things 
1) OIL  
2) To overthrow Assad and set up a privately owned (scam) Central bank like all the other nations of the world, controlled by the European banking families.  They don't like competition.
999 2018-09-11 21:58:39 But many AIM miners/oilies have picked up great assets on the cheap when oil/metal prices were on their arse and now coming good.
1000 2018-09-11 21:58:37 “Well...” she had started to wash a few onions and defrost the shrimp. “You cooked for me last time and I wanted to return the favor~” 

She handed him the onions so that he could finely chop them. While that happened, she got a pot with a bit of oil and garlic on the stove top.
1001 2018-09-11 21:58:33 Needs moar bear spray.
1002 2018-09-11 21:58:29 1) Oil is dead dinosaurs.
1003 2018-09-11 21:58:27 Cutting out animal products is the most productive way we can help fight deforestation as individuals considering +70% of soy is fed to livestock animals, and beef production is the largest contributor to deforestation, but I am absolutely with you for limiting palm oil as well
1004 2018-09-11 21:58:12 Steam inhale with vicks three times a day for about 5-10 mins. Try not to go out into the cold immediately after. I’ve suffered from sinus infections for as long as I can remember and this is the best way to treat them without antibiotics. Also take 3 doses of oregano oil a day.
1005 2018-09-11 21:58:06 Gritty capt planet reboot where the new planeteers try 2 convince CP 2 coalition build with affected communities to address climate change but instead CP spends half the season shanking oil barons and avoiding an alcohol problem
1006 2018-09-11 21:58:06 Since 9/11 we've spent over $4.6T on the "war on terror", yet terror attacks have multiplied. That's a lot of money to make the world less safe. Bring the money home for jobs, healthcare, education & a Green New Deal to stop the climate meltdown & make wars for oil obsolete.
1007 2018-09-11 21:57:58 Raw Shrimp in freezer (13-15 size).  I LOVE to make my own ramen with fettuccine noodles, shrimp, and veggies!  I use chicken broth, add some soy, sesame seed oil...then top it all off with grated parmesan and a few dots of sriracha!  #RidiculousNOMS
1008 2018-09-11 21:57:49 Weather you will drink it or use it as a massage oil?
1009 2018-09-11 21:57:45 big oil obviously spearheading the elon musk media smear campaign.
1010 2018-09-11 21:57:40 Changing the oil is one of the things they teach you in driver’s ed, isn’t it? Or was that the secret boys-only class I never knew about.
1011 2018-09-11 21:57:39 THIS. Is why ur full of shit. Biofuel, wind farms, new tech... but ur using submarines to identify oil we CANT burn #murderers
1012 2018-09-11 21:57:38 Joe Montana s 1st game and season wasn't an oil painting either
1013 2018-09-11 21:57:36 That would be #US. We fuel terrorism because we are militaristic and greedy. Why did Bin Laden bomb #US? Too many US bases in holy land. Why did ISIS emerge? We destroyed Iraq for oil. Let’s talk roots & stop fertilizing terror around the world. Do u think Yemenis like US today?
1014 2018-09-11 21:57:31 Cannabis oil is part of my formulation
1015 2018-09-11 21:57:25 Yes, also doing melatonin, plus valerian and CBD oil. Helps some, but I still see 3 o'clock roll around more often than not. *sigh*

1024 2018-09-11 21:55:43 Also don’t diss United being shit after Ferguson. When someone’s around that long it takes time to get the club back on track. 10-15 years ago City were Nobodies who were saved by Oil Money.
1025 2018-09-11 21:55:41 Indeed, in Oil Drum Lane!
1026 2018-09-11 21:55:39 I wonder if it’s the oil from the skittles that’s attracted to the washing up liquid?
1027 2018-09-11 21:55:15 What happened to our North Sea Oil Revenues, they disappeared as well
1028 2018-09-11 21:55:15 Pls can I get a kiosk at PH area?? Lemme comma be doing Akara and koko oo. And leave this Mobil Oil work
1029 2018-09-11 21:55:14 "First of all..." She sets two haversacks on the table, and opens the brown one. "Silence oil." She pulls out a small metal tin. "For the first six shots, the weapon will be completely silent. After that, the sound will be muffled for the next ten minutes."
1030 2018-09-11 21:55:13 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗠𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲: November WTI crude oil futures (CLX8) rallied more than 2% intraday today.
1031 2018-09-11 21:55:07 In today's WSJ: "Saudi Arabia’s national oil company is considering a $1 billion venture-capital fund to invest in international technology firms..." #Funds #BootUP #BootUPVentures
1032 2018-09-11 21:55:05 Did you film this from inside an oil drum ?
1033 2018-09-11 21:55:05 Yeassss my old pizza spot #bushwick. They still put too much oil to this day
1034 2018-09-11 21:55:00 I’m pretty sure that, while beef production is the largest single contributor to deforestation, the next two biggest contributors (palm oil and soybean production) add up to a similar amount.

So it’s more complicated than just cutting animal products.
1035 2018-09-11 21:54:50 On the waterfront New Haven Ct at work, watching from our NOC center, one of our Deutsch Bank funding partners was killed on the Boston flight, FBI was on site due to close proximity of oil delivery station and sub base.
1036 2018-09-11 21:54:46 @DiDiRNB another nurse question.. I Kurt literally pulled the skin off my back in 1129 places. Evidently my mom has tape that works too well. I have Silvadene and Cocunut Oil and I'm not going to the store. I know it isn't a burn, but since skin is gone will it help heal it?
1037 2018-09-11 21:54:44 Differin gel, neutrogena hydro boost exfoliating scrub, & a few drips of coconut oil for moisture. Oh & face masks like twice a week.
1038 2018-09-11 21:54:26 Oil dey your head. Wizzy for president 
1039 2018-09-11 21:54:25 I demand you 
A. Turn over all of your assets to the nearest homeless vagrant.
B. Stop using any form of fossil fuel, electricity and whale oil.
C. Walk everywhere, bare foot. Using a bicycle or even shoes exploits the workers and the cows.
1040 2018-09-11 21:54:20 Oh I agree 100%! The Bush machine completely used that tragedy to terrorize the middle east for oil.
But, I still try to remember those who were in that building that day, a lot of innocent nonmilitary admin workers just trying to pay bills. 
1041 2018-09-11 21:54:19 For example, where is Alaska's SWF getting its income from? Oil revenues. Making people's welfare conditional on their ongoing support for Fortune 500 companies' success is not a recipe for sustainable socialism.
1042 2018-09-11 21:53:47 Its beautiful day in oil country I'm pretty excited for the up coming season
1043 2018-09-11 21:53:45 Its the branch this whole earth stands for and you'll see what i mean when part of usa is the new Atlantis the earth cant take the amount of toxicated CO2 that we humans are putting out with luck oil runs out before the earth dies off
1044 2018-09-11 21:53:29 I'm an oil queen
1045 2018-09-11 21:53:27 What I meant to convey is that by late 2019 more WTI expected to be available due to new pipe, I also think mkt coming around to view that this oil may be trapped, for whatever reason, the crude quality being a big one. Thus 2019 has very different outlooks Brent vs WTI…
1046 2018-09-11 21:53:23  #Iran oil industry will faces U.S Sanctions and Iran  crude shipments to drop to around 1.5 million barrels a day this month, down from around 2.3 million barrels a day in June.

1050 2018-09-11 21:52:49 Btw! Have you ever tried DHC’s deep cleansing oil?
1051 2018-09-11 21:52:43 As @forgeofman says, don’t make your focus the suppression of evil and weakness.

Instead, work to REPLACE it with something good or strong.

Suppression will keep evil top of mind.

Replacement will eliminate evil.

Good & evil are like oil and water ... they don’t mix.
1052 2018-09-11 21:52:40 The only thing Repubs are working furiously to do is pay back the Big Oil, Gas & Coal honchos who stuffed money in their pockets, by gutting EPA regulations, and finding new ways to expolit the federal government to stuff MORE money in your pockets.
1053 2018-09-11 21:52:33 I can’t tell if this man on the metro is staring at me because he thinks I’m cute or if it’s because my hair is almost inhumanly greasy and he’s trying to determine whether I bathed in oil. Either is feasible really
1054 2018-09-11 21:52:32 That just makes me like her and the decision even more because Mulroney was an oil can.
1055 2018-09-11 21:52:23 Realized cabbage is not enough of a vegetable, so I found some freezer burnt green beans that might be salvageable. Sauteeing them with sesame oil, garlic and ponzu.
1056 2018-09-11 21:52:22 Idc who I think I am but I’ve been using cuticle oil and I’ve been leaving my conditioner in for 10 mins every time I shower and shit. I’m that bitch.
1057 2018-09-11 21:52:13 Of course. I believe ifrs has contributed alot more to non oil revenues in the past 3yrs
1058 2018-09-11 21:51:57 @realDonaldTrump and in particular the sanctions on oil, and those who work in this regard will remove the exemption. And not allow any currency to enter Iran. Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November, so that the regime can never export even a barrel of oil
1059 2018-09-11 21:51:53 Check engine light is still on and I need an oil change... getting the oil change now and a new tire 
1060 2018-09-11 21:51:31 Talking your car to the dealership to get serviced takes FOREVERRRRR  my nigga you’re only changing the oil and rotating tires !!!

1063 2018-09-11 21:50:12 De-bone & cut in pieces. Season, dredge in flour & sear on high heat using oil in the fry pan, then place pan with chicken pieces in oven to bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. let rest 5 minutes... and you have a good roast chicken in 20 minutes.
1064 2018-09-11 21:50:04 Actually had someone try to commission me for a portrait of a cat in oil painting I only do digital I can forward them to you
1065 2018-09-11 21:49:53 My oil change was $216 dollars

1073 2018-09-11 21:48:54 bro its not just about the fish though be real, it will prolly have other ingredients in it too. The oil it gets cooked in has to be halal too, it must be fried separately from oil that cooks meat plus not taking in the fact that cross contamination prolly happens

1078 2018-09-11 21:48:20 U.S crude oil closed down 21 cents, or 0.3%, at $67.54 a barrel on NY Mercantile Exchange @CMEGroup
1079 2018-09-11 21:48:15 Is it really about making us safer? Or is it simply about oil???
1080 2018-09-11 21:48:10 Looks like the heat shield or oil pan??
1081 2018-09-11 21:48:08 If you haven’t already, try cbd oil
1082 2018-09-11 21:48:06 Brent Crude Oil spot chart looks pretty decent - a breakout over $81 would be bullish big time.
1083 2018-09-11 21:48:02 i developed a nose piercing bump months ago and literally nothing would get rid of it but i started using jojoba oil on it 4 days ago and it’s basically gone!!
1084 2018-09-11 21:47:48 Why how much oil did they get from Afghanistan

1086 2018-09-11 21:47:42 If I had all the oil in #DonaldTrumpJr's I could heat my house this winter for free! And....#EriTrump's hair oil for my neighbor!!
1087 2018-09-11 21:47:41 I would love the draft to be reinstated because it would blow these stupid wars back to where we need to be out of them. We have no reason to be in those countries. The GOP caused those wars all over one thing. Oil and money  Screw the USA 
1088 2018-09-11 21:47:37 I think all of those Republicans who can't stay away from Putin are planning to do a oil and Natural gas deal where they will all make millions for theirselves.
1089 2018-09-11 21:47:25 I wish I could to stop this!
Syria is being attacked because Jacob Rothschild,Dick Cheney and Rupert Murdoch want the oil! Cheney allegedly help plan9/11to get us into Middle East wars
1090 2018-09-11 21:47:24 watch that heart rate
1091 2018-09-11 21:47:17 Was it MacMillan who said *events dear boy* or words to that effect. Europe needs oil and gas and new markets. Russia needs development. The *little way to go* might hopefully be soon.

1093 2018-09-11 21:47:07 The plan was first made in 2008, not in 2013. It was then updated every 2 years. The issue is the hypocrisy of the administration in regards to the Keystone Pipeline, his inability to deal with oil refineries, and the overall weakness of the CPP. His legacy on the enviro is weak.
1094 2018-09-11 21:46:59 But that's subsidised by the oil and resources you've been stealing from the middle East for the last 30years

1099 2018-09-11 21:46:19 I have a couple of friends online who do similar to you in terms of buying a basic coconut oil in the more solid form and then using that for everything (in food, as body oil and hair conditioner) to save money. They both cited generic UK store bargain brands though IIRC.
1100 2018-09-11 21:46:17 IMAGINE, if you will, a middle East country plays a VERY LARGE part in attacking the U. S. and yet, we treat them as if they are sweet innocent peace loving people. SA can do no wrong. In the mean time ubl was BORN THERE. HIS FAMILY OWN OIL THERE
Nothing to see here
1101 2018-09-11 21:46:14 Making oil and gas, so you guys can protect us 
1102 2018-09-11 21:45:56 And imagine the oil slick that would cause. Eww!
1103 2018-09-11 21:45:46 According to Politico 2016 Hillary was the left. Are you now saying She couldn't handle it either?
Best foreign policy.... no Regime change for OIL. 
Next....Recognize a Palestinian state.
1104 2018-09-11 21:45:45 If Isis messes with Libyas tanks oil about to be expensive . Today’s gains were massive though it looks like  head and shoulders on the daily.

1106 2018-09-11 21:45:39 @AntoniaJuhasz Already as a kid, I remembered going to the beaches of the Mediterranean.... we had to clean our feet with lighter fluid afterwords: Tar and blobs of oil...
1107 2018-09-11 21:45:32 Ours are like $66. Bout normal on most oil changes
1108 2018-09-11 21:45:27 + lemon juice, lil olive oil & the everything but the bagel seasoning? A dream for salad dressing 
1109 2018-09-11 21:45:23 Family in the oil business & all their drama. Think GG without the narrator & secret texts
1110 2018-09-11 21:45:18 Trump wants to ruin Canada. Time for Feds to ship oil east, provide an oil transport subsidy, and sell 50% oil other markets. Forget the US! Does he know that 9k Canadians work in Detroit because they can't find American skilled workers?
1111 2018-09-11 21:45:16 wait so you don’t own a oil field?

1113 2018-09-11 21:44:59 Both wars did we win? Hell no we just left if we did the Marshall plan. Iraq would’ve loved us but the gop sent the troops back over BP and Exxon the terrorists are getting too near the oil. See that has nothing to do with the country it’s over Oil.
1114 2018-09-11 21:44:58 I’m 3 hot oil treatments away from a good updo

1116 2018-09-11 21:44:35 Where are the creative ladies in the kitchen? Tell us ooo, What food can u make with #500 having just oil & salt at home?
1117 2018-09-11 21:44:19 "Met" BB @ Phish on Northerly Isle in (prob) 2014. Dude had this vape that was... not tobacco/nicotine. What was that? It had like dry product in it, not oil.
1118 2018-09-11 21:44:02 Only oil is what matters to you, but the blood of +7,000 people lost in #Benghazi war against terrorism doesn't concern you nor the puppet govt u impose on us. #Libya-ns never chose this govt, even the elected #HoR has not given it confidence. It only represents u & ur interests!
1119 2018-09-11 21:44:02 Just look at that S . . t!  Anyone want that Train going through their State -- maybe everyday?  U.S., has enough Oil & Gas to last us 200 years; we don't need nor want that stinkin stuff.  Will we ever put People ahead of Profits that are even derived from the Devil's Brew?!
1120 2018-09-11 21:43:53 you want bread with oil or you want chicken with potatoes
1121 2018-09-11 21:43:53 Largely correct although the oil cartel generally messes about with fuel prices and the petrol companies like to keep prices high even when wholesale prices drop.. but yes...
1122 2018-09-11 21:43:52 Im no oil painting or Don Juan but I hope I have some attractive elements to my personality. How hideous for someone to have to spend his whole life buying attention because he no self redeeming features traits or qualities.. Those that sell to him are just laughing in his face.

1124 2018-09-11 21:43:40 May I suggest rosemary olive oil bagel with honey walnut cream cheese, chicken salad, sprouts, peppers and lettuce?   Game changer.
1125 2018-09-11 21:43:36 Damn Texas got that oil money
1126 2018-09-11 21:43:36 By "other investment consequences not controlled for here", do you mean supply-chain-issues related to but not categorized as oil & mining?
1127 2018-09-11 21:43:27 Now you know the difference between a snake oil salesman and a businessman.

1133 2018-09-11 21:42:55 If they’re anxious or having a hard time sleeping,  any sleep tea with camomile & valerian is good. Also lavender is calming as an oil in baths, on pillows etc to help with sleep
1134 2018-09-11 21:42:51 Do you miss the baby oil videos? From Finn 
1135 2018-09-11 21:42:47 For your info bro, those girls don't use vaseline again..

They use olive oil also known as anointing oil now, so its cheaper. God bless them for us
1136 2018-09-11 21:42:40 i have the stupidest nightmares like last night i had a dream that i got the clear ecostyler gel as opposed to the argan oil or olive oil one 
1137 2018-09-11 21:42:36 Did you know this is a real picture! Did you know bush and the Clintons were involved in this they sold us to the saudis, for oil, they sacrificed American citizens for GREED! We will never forget I live in New York I lived this day!! And days after united with NYs
1138 2018-09-11 21:42:32 @BLMUtah received competitive bids for 69 of 109 oil and gas lease parcels, netting nearly $3.3 million in an online auction today that also drew protests from environmental organizations.

1141 2018-09-11 21:42:05 Has he got any more snake oil?
1142 2018-09-11 21:41:47 Al-Qaida was friends with CIA, Syria has a Russian Navel Base, Qaddafi and Saddam proposed that oil shall be traded against Gold and not dollars and they changed the mode of payment in Euro. Afghanistan was the only way to sit right next to China. Wake up, it's about time.
1143 2018-09-11 21:41:38 Mexico's production of 1.8 million b/d in July, is said to be 2.6 b/d by 2025. The new upcoming president is going to invest $3.9 billion in Pemex's production budget and exploration for oil. They currently have little support and production levels have fallen since 2004.

1145 2018-09-11 21:41:29 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1146 2018-09-11 21:41:29 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1147 2018-09-11 21:41:29 @professorgreen getting rid of all the oil in your diffuser before giving it up such a good idea  #legend #CelebsInSolitary
1148 2018-09-11 21:41:29 Try magnolia tissue oil love  It's inexpensive and it works 
1149 2018-09-11 21:41:06 Hi John. Your pizza with caramelized onions and motor oil will be delivered in 51 min via truck.
1150 2018-09-11 21:41:01 Very clever did you see what was the buying price for crude oil during that period?
1151 2018-09-11 21:40:41 The definition of a con man is a person who is an expert at gaslighting the public, they are also known  as people who sell snake oil. These people will lie continually, and if caught in the lie, they will tell another lie to get out of the first lie It’s call pathological liars
1152 2018-09-11 21:40:26 The super evil oil companies have a cave system where they're robbing sheeple. The goal is to eliminate the white race.
1153 2018-09-11 21:40:22 Hands up who wants to see a video of Matthew Corbett trying to dance, but Sooty & Sweep have put slippery oil on his shoes, except he doesn’t actually do any sliding at all, but the editor has created the unconvincing illusion of sliding by adding tyre screeching sound effects?
1154 2018-09-11 21:40:14 i had got allergic to something and my skin started tripping , but once i used coconut oil instant relief

1157 2018-09-11 21:39:55 I will never forget that it was an inside job as an excuse to go to war for oil...
1158 2018-09-11 21:39:34 Yeah I've been doing keto for around 2 years now. A lot of the stuff out there is trying to hock FORMULATED SUPER FATS at a premium, and I try to do it as cheap as I can. 2tbsp solid coconut oil, 1tbsp stick butter (ish, I'm Southern), and a bit of low cal sweetener.
1159 2018-09-11 21:39:12 Yes. Yes. Yes, but also because I realize the key to striking oil is to keep digging. A full time gig is always the goal, but reaching that on YouTube money alone is a bit impossible. However, it's a great platform for other streams of revenue.
1160 2018-09-11 21:38:49 Lol i just had to spend $100 on math hw and my bank account is crying. Anyone wanna help me out? Donations are appreciated and i also have art, essential oil rollers, soap, and macrame for sale :)

1162 2018-09-11 21:38:18 Lol veggies have carbs too. Avocado has enough oil. Every nutrient can be found in fruits & veggies oh. It’s us that have taken this survival plan to another level of indomie, rice, yam etc. lmao! Shebi Adam & eve were eating apples
1163 2018-09-11 21:38:11 Got my riding tractor mower back today....all tuned up, oil changed, filters, blade sharpened. Running like new! I mowed the lawn again!
1164 2018-09-11 21:38:09 Imagine how different the world would be if #GW had ended our addiction to oil and war. We could have spent the Trillion $, we spent on war, on infrastructure, alternative energy, etc. ISIS would not exist and Iraq and the region would be in one piece if not at ! #FoxWar
1165 2018-09-11 21:38:02 Love east end spices. And Rajah, KTC, Natco and Jeera where available. Oh and Dunn's River! All better and cheaper than supermarket brands. Almost fell over when I realised KTC coconut oil was 10% of the price of all the others!!

1169 2018-09-11 21:37:26 Love a Chelsea bun, but boys always want the technical challenge! Should be easy enough, not that different from my BBQ flatbreads, just need to brush with garlic oil (and try under grill).
1170 2018-09-11 21:37:26 Yep, bring the troops back safe and stop interfering with other counties . What business for the U.S out there that’s worth the lives of our troops and other innocents in other countries. To the U.S it’s always “ Blood for Oil “
1171 2018-09-11 21:36:54 Where's the oil?
1172 2018-09-11 21:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
1173 2018-09-11 21:36:39 C'mon now, Putin ordered him to do this so he can help Vlad's oil prices. Where have you been? This is the new narrative until a newer one comes along.
1174 2018-09-11 21:36:36 DONT SLEEP ON THESE OIL HEADS DAW
1175 2018-09-11 21:36:36 Let me tell you now since I always say I’ll post them then forget.Super simple,though.Sauté bell peppers/onion after you slice them wth garlic and olive oil.Add the sausage and shrimp and seasoning and I used Alfredo suace then tossed it all in fettuccine

1178 2018-09-11 21:36:16 This kid can't even open a bottle of Wesson Oil! Might want to rethink that one David!
1179 2018-09-11 21:36:12 It used to be money talks.  For them it was "OIL GREASES THE PALMS"
1180 2018-09-11 21:36:05 Manuel - I need more oil!
1181 2018-09-11 21:36:04 The so called helping of every Indian is not understood here govt is bent up on to squeeze all the money from lower and medium middle class people by virtue of heavy taxes and inflation of crude oil gas etc so do some mercy on us
1182 2018-09-11 21:36:00 The oil is from Kurdistan region of Iraq, which was sent by pipeline to Ceyhan, Turkey.
1183 2018-09-11 21:36:00 Bon nouvelle skincare: savon pH neutre+ eau de rose+ bi oil tous les soirs. On verra le résultat
1184 2018-09-11 21:35:59 20+ years ago, I remember a developer building one to honor the show. Complete with oil stain in the driveway and corn cob curtains.  I wonder if this is the same one.  It was off Boulder Hwy just south of Sam Boyd Stadium
1185 2018-09-11 21:35:53 Better check a newer report.  Norway has the second lowest disposable income in Europe.  It now ranks 55 on the happy index.  To much ducking tax on co2.  Oil is no benefit to the people.  Our oil is cheaper to buy in UK than here. WHEN WILL NORWAY  WAKE UP!?
1186 2018-09-11 21:35:43 Stay away from our.national parks. You cut.the budget then you come in and are going to save our parks. But you don't tell.people that you are going to.mine , drill for oil and frac for natural gas. Clear cut our forest , foul the fishing river's with thousands of cattle.

1189 2018-09-11 21:35:35 EPA plans on their website will give oil and gas companies 60 days to repair Methane gas leaks. Methane is major cause of global warming. This is ridiculous

1199 2018-09-11 21:34:14 As much as I wish to see emission free cars and renewal energy take over, it is a very serious issue with an enormous amount of jobs at stake!  The change must give time to people to shift to new jobs outside of oil industry
1200 2018-09-11 21:34:12 No use oil and vinegar
1201 2018-09-11 21:34:11 I remember in college back in 2009. This man was practically Hitler. He was the laughing stock, warmongering, oil stealing, white supremest Nazi. Now, not so much. Now there’s cute article of him handing candle to the Obama’s. I had and still have great respect for 43. Good man
1202 2018-09-11 21:34:07 Remember the pipeline and oil workers your government screwed by not getting the pipeline built.  Take some responsibility for a change
1203 2018-09-11 21:34:05 Al-Qaida was friends with CIA, Syria has a Russian Navel Base, Qaddafi and Saddam proposed that oil shall be traded against Gold and not dollars and they changed the mode of payment in Euro. Afghanistan was the only way to sit right next to China. Wake up, it's about time.
1204 2018-09-11 21:34:04 The EU may run out of time and take them as they are, warts and all. The EU has three big problems:  the EURO is €ucked, the US tell them to sort out their own defence and pay for it, they lack oil and raw materials. Russia has the answers.
1205 2018-09-11 21:33:47 Sorry if my rec is kinda Useless but in general I add oil/fats and then a little almond/coconut creamer and that's the best method I've found.
1206 2018-09-11 21:33:47 How to get rid of ants completely:
• Mix 15-20 drops lavender oil
• 1/4 cup white vinegar 
• 3 cups bleach
• Drink
1207 2018-09-11 21:33:43 Customer: do I have to wait an hour for my oil change? I can do it in 10-15 minutes!
Me: why would you want us to do it then?
1208 2018-09-11 21:33:37 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
1209 2018-09-11 21:33:25 Many of our customers with the FA experience a burning oil smell or blue smoke coming from their exhaust after installing aftermarket J-Pipes or turbo back exhaust systems.  Super easy install and well worth the 35 bucks.
1210 2018-09-11 21:33:14 long before trump! but saudi arabia is fine. good democracy, hard on crime, lots of oil. I fear my people play a large roll in this.

1212 2018-09-11 21:33:00 Pretty sure whoever said it had its backing,  do you realise that Scotland if sorry when independent from uk will be an oil giant in the Eu.   You do realise this, and what country wouldn’t want

1215 2018-09-11 21:32:01 Ask a land owner with oil or coal on their land in Southern Illinois and see what they would tell you to do on this subject. You can again stick this opinion where the sun does not shine. You lie.
1216 2018-09-11 21:31:57 MCT is often priced at a Trendy Diet Premium so that's why I use $18 a tub cheap coconut oil... idk the specifics of your diet needs though

I recently started using Cetaphil as my face cleanser. Still have bad acne tho

I don't joke with Shea Butter oil too
1219 2018-09-11 21:31:42 Your group also can’t give me any facts on what Trump did wrong. All you listen to is liberal biased news. Do you even know anything about the oil field or you just pretend to?
1220 2018-09-11 21:31:35 Gas should cost THE SAME in every state.

Oil barons, I'll help you.

Find the lowest price in the country.
Make it a law that every gas station has to use that gas and at that price.

This will be a temporary shield while more and more stations go under.

Solar cars 4 life.
1221 2018-09-11 21:31:27 What a rich perspective from an Oil Rich $$ Citeah fan.  Did you ask him where he was in 2008 when his club was thrashed by Middlesbrough?  #TTID
1222 2018-09-11 21:31:04 We gave them modern everything, they were sand-dwellers prior, but we wanted their oil, so we gave them passports...

By "we" - I mean greedy politicians who profited from these arrangements, at a great cost to the peoples of this nation.

And they still charge us for petrol...
1223 2018-09-11 21:30:57 I paid attention in shop class so I remember that the water pump is where the fuel, air, and oil mixes in a 2 stroke engine.

1233 2018-09-11 21:29:56 Well we see you are in support of the Fracking and Oil company supporting Govonor of New York. Thankfully you are just one vote for the #Establishment #VoteProgressiveOnly #VoteCynthiaNixon Thursday. Want change? Change your vote.
1234 2018-09-11 21:29:54 You really don’t know your history do you. Power cuts were because of COAL stocks running low due to Miners industrial action! The 3 day week was to preserve coal stocks so that energy was available for critical services! Oil shock was in 73, power cuts were occurring from 1970!
1235 2018-09-11 21:29:40 We’re discussing everything that you can do with coconut oil. @jdprose just referred to it as “the WD-40 of food.”

1237 2018-09-11 21:29:38 Hah! That’s rich. The party of Russian oil and weapons payoffs calling grassroots organizing vote her out and hold her accountable a bribe. Sounding more like Trump every day. Note: Free speech cuts both ways Senator.
1238 2018-09-11 21:29:33 Unfortunately I don't have brand recs for mct oil because I've never used it much. I have a small bottle of generic food grade fractionated coconut oil because it's pretty samey?
1239 2018-09-11 21:29:30 I spoke with some Nigerians who've seen much the same thing happen to them. Exxon and other oil companies move in and make Lagos look like Los Angeles.
1240 2018-09-11 21:29:29 What can make it haram and not halal is the simple fact that although the fish us fried in a seperate vat to other items the oil in the end is all drained into 1 pan to be filtered meaning the haram and halal is mixed

1243 2018-09-11 21:29:09 ... and what you don't tell your people is that hundreds of foreign nationals were killed, too, and that fifteen of the nineteen perpetrators were Saudis whose country - buying a lot of weaponry in the US and having a lot of oil is not affected by #45's travel ban for muslims.

1245 2018-09-11 21:28:52 Perhaps,but many families depend on parents to pay for the oil,provide funds for food etc.Elderly living alone are hand to mouth.Genteel pov
1246 2018-09-11 21:28:44 Inshallah.  It's a matter of when Assad's backers eventually go broke.  Highly doubt he'll have a functioning rump state without subsidized Iranian oil
1247 2018-09-11 21:28:44 Hummus light half a donut ! Olive oil good for you keep dipping !
1248 2018-09-11 21:28:41 Get an essential oil diffuser
1249 2018-09-11 21:28:40 Yeah, we should all agree that the Saudis are bad people and we shouldn't be doing business with them. But money (oil) talks.
1250 2018-09-11 21:28:39 You made a sacrifice which has made you really big sums of money 
you have attacked and stolen oil and other treasures in the name of looking for terrorists

1252 2018-09-11 21:28:01 My hands smell like motor oil
1253 2018-09-11 21:27:59 What kind of oil
1254 2018-09-11 21:27:50 Like Standard Oil. Break them up, monopolies. We demand freedom of speech of all, not just the leftist.
1255 2018-09-11 21:27:46 Interesting article, though best estimates seem to converge on peak oil demand in the 2040s around 110+ million bbl/day. Not sure on natural gas but probably later peak than oil. Keep in mind that peak does not equal end.
1256 2018-09-11 21:27:36 Femi Otedola son of Former Governor of Lagos and MD/CEO Zenon oil PLC accepted to be PDP Gubernatorial aspirant in Lagos as Governor Akinwunmi Ambode 2nd term bid remain dicey within his Party APC.
1257 2018-09-11 21:27:30 When You look at how we live, you can see that we like artificial things than the natural. Whereas, we are natural beings. We are only trying to bond two cement blocks with oil and its very sad.
1258 2018-09-11 21:27:26 It's probably the oil they use for frying, the smell of grease can make me a little queasy too, they'll give them to you in a takeout box anyways you don't gotta eat it there
1259 2018-09-11 21:27:19 During last season gayatri got some powder and for that BB warned her that next time we can’t give, why BB didn’t warned mumtaz for olive oil..I didn’t see BB warned mumtaz for oil..did you see that??
1260 2018-09-11 21:27:19 I woulda done that but my flux decapacitator is a pre-95 model with a torx spun ball peen hammer-style bit on the end, and we both know how that thing smells when it’s running in a perpendicular pattern to the dodecahedron-like oil pan. 

And it decapacitates passengers.
1261 2018-09-11 21:26:55 Foreign policy is "Russia collapsed, we have food, we have oil, screw you all, oh hey there's a corporation in Honduras that needs our help".

Dollar Diplomacy mk 2
1262 2018-09-11 21:26:36 Ok got it! Sorry I'm asking so many questions but is it Any special kinda oil or just any works?
1263 2018-09-11 21:26:32 Why was John Kerry meeting with Iranians in London after President Trump called off the Iran Deal?  To try and salvage a deal where he was paid?  To sell out the U.S. in order to allow Rockefeller-owned French oil company Total the rights to Iranian oil?  
JK = Globalist puppet
1264 2018-09-11 21:26:25 Selling snake oil to the masses
1265 2018-09-11 21:26:18 The powder is pricey but travels well. Better Half by Califa farms is a good coconut cream and almondmilk blend and you can get it unsweetened too. A splash of that + coconut oil will take the oil greasiness down and make it nice and creamy.
1266 2018-09-11 21:26:13 WELL IM NOT REALLY SURE BECAUSE I SUCK AT MAINTAINING MY HAIR but my hairdresser used some sort of oil for the tips and it's been doing a really good thing??? I CANT REALLY HELP... also i asked her to cut it shorter than usual bc of reasons
1267 2018-09-11 21:26:12 Plus, people want jobs.  Have you volunteered to give up your job to an unemployed oil worker.
1268 2018-09-11 21:26:10 This comes as no surprise but it gives the truth behind the obscene politics of the Right - but then the poor, disadvantaged and needy aren’t the source of oil, rich minerals, high profit tech and financial services.

1272 2018-09-11 21:25:20 What kind of body oil?
1273 2018-09-11 21:25:06 Did Connor grow a few more inches, or is everyone else short?

1276 2018-09-11 21:24:51 I do coconut oil and butter coffee. Ghee is also an option, but I don't follow the strict recipe for "bulletproof" coffee. If you're just looking to bulk it up a little, solid jarred coconut oil is way cheaper than mct.

For non-blender days, I use Coconut Cloud powder.
1277 2018-09-11 21:24:40 @CityTshwane being powerless at half 11 at night, with already extreme anxiety is not helping me. Not even my CBD oil helps. Please sort it out, thanks for the work already done. #faerieglen #poweroutage #powerless #eskom
1278 2018-09-11 21:24:35 At the time “everyone” was relieved that Bush was prez & not Gore. In hindsight, 2000 was the election that may have most decided the fate of the world for the worse. Not that he was any great savior, but Gore could’ve weaned us off oil & at least not invaded Iraq
1279 2018-09-11 21:24:33 Yep! I use it in place of oil in muffins and it makes them so moist & yummy. I also really like applesauce as a topper for potato or sweet potato pancakes!
1280 2018-09-11 21:24:33 Very empty response. We shall see how the diabolic company will extract that oil. They should endeavour to come along with coffins
1281 2018-09-11 21:24:29 This city produces I believe 80% of this countries oil and they keep them happy. WOW (I may be wrong but that's crazy to me)
1282 2018-09-11 21:24:27 He expended his scholarly oil in the intractable search for the 'absolute unit'
1283 2018-09-11 21:24:26 Emperor Snake Oil 
1284 2018-09-11 21:24:23 Bcoz the Saudis were part of the hoax, flight records showed in some of the flights there were no people of middle eastern descent 9/11 was a false flag  operation staged to justifying invading Iraq in order 2 steal Iraqi oil
1285 2018-09-11 21:24:21 What is lotion other then masturbation fluid ? That shit lowkey always puzzled me when people got ashy. Truth is I im actually the different one whos body adjusts oil production by season.
1286 2018-09-11 21:24:14 Fred, human nature there!  I’m in for the long haul!  The story is too important to give in to the negative which is what the oil industry and shorts want you to do!  Facts facts facts people!!
1287 2018-09-11 21:24:02 Sometimes makeup remover will help remove the glue, or coconut oil has also worked. Soak a cotton swab in either one and apply to lashes for a few minutes, otherwise you may have to wait for them to fall off naturally! #hopethishelps #lol
1288 2018-09-11 21:23:40 I love the flo!  Great job with the kids Connor 
1289 2018-09-11 21:23:32 Come and buy Coconut oil for your customers abeg. I need to change my pillow case . 
1290 2018-09-11 21:23:21 Chavez’s war on the middle class to champion the poor and the expropriation of land reduced productivity and a reliance on foreign imports ensued. Oil price drops and he laws of economics kick in and his economic policies unravelled in no time.
1291 2018-09-11 21:23:17 $55 on an oil change... Ouch.
1292 2018-09-11 21:22:49 Liberal and research? Oil and water.
1293 2018-09-11 21:22:44 I just heat up coconut oil with a spoon and lighter like a junkie.
1294 2018-09-11 21:22:38 But they own FB, Twitter, Insta, Google, telecom companies and a few oil wells
1295 2018-09-11 21:22:22 *facepalm it's basically the lowest in the country (12%, ont is a hair lower) and there's no PST which gives it a massive advantage PLUS there's the NDP subsity program for sustainable businesses. But ok. Oil sands. Just stick to it.
1296 2018-09-11 21:22:19 Who is going to eat the losses of natural gas and oil refineries being retired?
1297 2018-09-11 21:22:17 There is no other solution.  It must be bleach.  I’ve tried tea tree oil, it’s not working.
1298 2018-09-11 21:22:08 Idk when we are outside operating heavy machinery, climbing poles, laying out fiber, gas, oil, sewage, water, or electrical lines it can get dangerous  safety first lol #OSHA
1299 2018-09-11 21:21:55 uses oil as a facial moisturizer
calls flossing once a week a win
stops buying shirts that need ironing
keeps the thermostat at 79

guess i'm officially a grown-up.
1300 2018-09-11 21:21:42 Dear lord. I’m adulting. Scheduled my first oil change tomorrow . But my cars gonna be ready for these road trips this weekend and next
1301 2018-09-11 21:21:27 Just an aside bros, #Tinubu retired as Chief Treasurer of Mobil oil Nigeria. So his career didn't really start off in politics. Though his biggest break in life must've been after joining partisan politics during d military era. Politicians in Nigeria must be stoppd 4rm looting

1303 2018-09-11 21:21:21 Oh I forgot the magnesium oil spray. Brilliant.
1304 2018-09-11 21:21:17 Not easy picking good oil and mining plays that are actually investments - as opposed to pretending they’re an investment whilst trying to lure in buyers to pump the SP! Need a fair bit of luck as they are usually exploration plays
1305 2018-09-11 21:21:08 Try my CBD oil @:

1306 2018-09-11 21:21:05 Yh but it’s not vegetarian if it’s fried in the same oil
1307 2018-09-11 21:20:56 The other day i was so stressed out I left the office, went to H&B down the road. Bought lavender oil. Went back and put it in hot water and just smelled it till I relaxed.
1308 2018-09-11 21:20:55 Salúdame a la princesa!
1309 2018-09-11 21:20:31 How many tax breaks did you promise for this small contribution to the economy after going in dry on the oil sector
1310 2018-09-11 21:20:28 うわーーーー！三田先生おめでとうございます！！！！！！！！
1311 2018-09-11 21:20:28 CBD oil actually really helps!
1312 2018-09-11 21:20:11 Prolly fried in the same oil as the other meats or smth
1313 2018-09-11 21:19:56 Yes but they will never have perm. seat in unsc
And USA will bring democracy to KSA when there will be no more oil
Indians should know UN is not for us even tho we give them soldiers
UN is just created for preventing ww3 in Europe and to protect Israel which only USA does for now
1314 2018-09-11 21:19:52 What shall it profit Nana Addo to sell the whole of Ghana’s Bauxite to the Chinese in return for snake oil??
1315 2018-09-11 21:19:39 This oil pen is all good & stuff but there's nothing like smoking a nice fat blunt
1316 2018-09-11 21:19:34 as long as it isnt that god awful patchouli oil
1317 2018-09-11 21:19:27 100% they knew! Not only did they know, they planned the fucking thing! It all stems down to wanting to start a war to gain control over oil.
1318 2018-09-11 21:19:26 Sand are about 80-85% of alberta''s oil every year, it's an inferior product and requires heavy refinement. There's a lot of it but why do it? No one really wants it if they don't have to. It's because conventional oil is drying up. co's would like cheap sell-able oil, not enough
1319 2018-09-11 21:19:16 Yuppppp. Waters out of the cylinders and oil now. Bout to put new oil and plugs in, then see if she fires.

I pray, I didn't bend anything. *fingers crossed*
1320 2018-09-11 21:19:09 40 years ago we should have been transitioning away from Alberta's dependency on its oil industry. I don't see this ending well....

1328 2018-09-11 21:18:29 i mean it’s gonna hurt but i won’t hurt too bad as long as you oil your ears up before you size up and don’t size up too often. i waited a month each time before i sized up so i wouldn’t get blow outs.
1329 2018-09-11 21:18:26 Today, we’re continuing to be on the leading edge of oil sands technologies. We take a balanced approach to technology development, focusing on both continuous improvement technology  and strategic technology #OST2018
1330 2018-09-11 21:18:12 And Mark, I believe the opposite. I believe that so many of Trump followers are being duped by a snake oil salesman who has the initials of DJT.
1331 2018-09-11 21:18:02 And yet we keep handing them our money for oil, with a smile. @POTUS understands that security requires the need to be energy independent, and that we have the resources to get there.
1332 2018-09-11 21:17:54 Of course you do realise if Scotland becomes independent Shetland will leave, rejoin Norway and take all the oil with them 
1333 2018-09-11 21:17:50 9/11 was nothing but a false flag operation part of a broader covert operations by USA oil tycoons & defense contractors hell bent on starting endless wars they could use for self enrichment
1334 2018-09-11 21:17:40 my neighbour posted a photo of a "cute spider" near our door  I swear, I was ready to bitch slap her into 2020.  I sprayed bleach into every crevice. The worst. Get Peppermint oil and kill the bitch.
1335 2018-09-11 21:17:29 The US developed the Saudi Arabian oil industry that brought fortunes that brought Islamic Jihad to the west.
1336 2018-09-11 21:17:27 Boi oil paints are expensiveeeee.
1337 2018-09-11 21:17:24 Just showed your movie "deep water horizon" to my history classroom after a discussion about the oil industry. You have become a classroom favorite!

DOES THIS MEAN I NEED A TUNE-UP AND A CHANGE OF OIL?
1339 2018-09-11 21:17:20 Does we bring our oil from Saudi Arabia by boat?  What could go wrong right?
1340 2018-09-11 21:17:17 Alex, have you tried laying down with an ice pack on your head in a cool and dark room? Sometimes it helps to put an ice pack behind your neck,, too. Also, do you use aromatherapy oils? Dabbing each temple with peppermint oil helps. Hope you feel better soon. Hugs

1344 2018-09-11 21:16:53 I am pleased for you, I to suffered seizures during sleep. Not nice at all. I've been taking cannabis oil, it has done wonders. I truly hope and pray that a new chapter has started in life and all the endings will always be a happy ones

1346 2018-09-11 21:16:50 @subaru_usa your dealership with @WalserAutoGroup has a rapid decline in customer service lately. I had to have Subaru USA go to bat for me with them regarding not guaranteeing their work, their free shuttle service is only offered some days, and an oil change takes 60 minutes.

1349 2018-09-11 21:16:44 Cutting regulations on oil and gas is actually a good thing @BernieSanders. It helps increase economic boom for the entire country. It literally could bring millions of Americans out of Poverty! Why do you hate the Poor people Bernie?

I’m going back to relax shem 
1354 2018-09-11 21:16:28 Fun reminder that 9/11 basically happened because we’re imperialists who fucked up the Middle East in order to get oil and prop up puppet regimes, and while death is sad and murder is evil, we responded by going even harder with our bullshit white supremacist imperialism

1359 2018-09-11 21:15:42 I'm assuming that's in the auto-repair, correct? What brand of oil do you like best?
1360 2018-09-11 21:15:41 On top of your brilliant call out of the Kern River I will add the the Central Valley is fed by the Kern River and the produced water from the OIL fields is used for Produce that hits our grocery shelves

1363 2018-09-11 21:15:21 My dental hygienist whitesplained coconut oil to me and I couldn’t even say anything bc her hands were in my mouth. That truly hurt me more than the cavity she was filling.
1364 2018-09-11 21:15:13 Never forget (terror threat to keep people frightened) and NEVER tell that your government and did 911. Stay scared, support our endless wars against CIA created terrorists for And oil!
1365 2018-09-11 21:15:07 When you have a to high concentration which often is used for cancer or MS, it often leads to headaches. That's the only side effects I know, but also only in these high concentrations. You can always reduce concentration with give any other oil to it.

1369 2018-09-11 21:14:36 Unlikely. They have done nothing over the oil companies to level out petrol prices.
1370 2018-09-11 21:14:12 Fusion will be the most powerful source ever! Even more oil ... 
1371 2018-09-11 21:14:07 Phil just showed Dom how to correctly put olive oil on a pizza. If that's not showing him his Italian heritage, I don't know what is..

1379 2018-09-11 21:13:16 Ahh good oil shimmers, hurlers on the ditch!!
1380 2018-09-11 21:13:14 If you’re wondering if I’m impulsive, I just went shopping for a couple flannels and ended up buying a framed oil painting
1381 2018-09-11 21:13:08 I apply it directly on my skin just cause I’m use to it but you can always add a lil olive or coconut oil
1382 2018-09-11 21:13:00 Yes. Yes i can. Money from oil wealth approiated for royal family. Wish the stolen more.
1383 2018-09-11 21:12:55 Innovation isn’t new to Suncor – we pioneered oil sands development. Our early investments in technology helped unlock the potential of the oil sands by improving reliability, expanding productivity and driving down costs while reducing our environmental footprint #OST2018
1384 2018-09-11 21:12:48 Nail oil? Gotta try it! Thanks Demu!
1385 2018-09-11 21:12:21 Because of all the oil they got from it
1386 2018-09-11 21:12:20 y do windshield wipers cost so cot damn much smh. b costing almost as much as an oil change
1387 2018-09-11 21:12:03 Hoping for a factory sale. I’m even one back on oil storage space. 
1388 2018-09-11 21:11:55 I'm sorry. Nah I hate kfc because of the amount of oil their meet has 
1389 2018-09-11 21:11:51 I just took a bath with peppermint essential oil because I had a migraine. I don't recommend it. Much like bathing in icy hot. But I think my migraine is finally dying down!
1390 2018-09-11 21:11:42 They didn't pay because they control the oil and the oil controls the dollar.
1391 2018-09-11 21:11:37 Precisely. Ensure whatever beard oil you acquire has a hearty amount of Jojoba oil, as this is generally accepted as the most beneficial carrier oil for facial hair. 

Scent is where differences come into play. Find your ideal fragrance and never settle for less.
1392 2018-09-11 21:11:10 Same!! Pop loved the ones with mustard but I stick to Olive oil!
1393 2018-09-11 21:11:01 thats because the current agenda is still to preserve oil interests. elon musk is the other side of that coin
1394 2018-09-11 21:11:00 As I mentioned before, there are a lot of silly people who don't know what risk is. These inspections are not anti-cannabis; they're pro-safety.

Silly like the people who smoke while making RSO or butane honey oil.

If enough fail it shows the need for education.

1409 2018-09-11 21:08:40 Diversity was a blessing for Texas.  We were manly a oil and gas state.  When prices fell we had to deal with oil workers who made good money that went to no money.
1410 2018-09-11 21:08:27 Dr broners organic argan oil facewash after some witch hazel drenched cotton.  I still need to get up on that face mask life tho.  Thats the next level.  But im definitely living my best life right now.

1413 2018-09-11 21:08:06 I don’t know why fans are so worried right now man. At this point He needs the Oil more than they need him. We’re not talking Hedman here. Do we think a deal won’t get done? Not coming to camp hurts him the most. Maybe Bouchard gets a better look.
I love Nurse but let’s relax.
1414 2018-09-11 21:07:59 It was when inflation was high in whole world & crude oil Price was high too. Not like today when purchase price of fuel is not that high but to Janta very high.
1415 2018-09-11 21:07:59 Lesson learned folks, always get ur oil changed when the light comes on :)
1416 2018-09-11 21:07:48 So u mean to tell me...I can get glasses, an oil change, a new outfit, a 6-inch sub, and some cat litter in one stop???? #StupidQuestionsAtWalmart
1417 2018-09-11 21:07:39 Shout out to the person whom thinks perforating bottoms of boxes for 12 litres worth of extra virgin olive oil was a good idea.

What kind of a legendary idiot are you for making a painfully obvious design flaw like that?
1418 2018-09-11 21:07:18 European countries are not socialist countries. They are capitalist countries that have adopted socialist programs when they made money thanks to capitalism. Do you know that Vanuzuela is giving control of the oil fields back to private companies? Socialism does not work.
1419 2018-09-11 21:07:17 This is hilarious. An Aframax, assuming 12 knots, burns about 20 tons of fuel oil per day. 10 days trip as shown, ~200 tons. Say $450/ton, costed the company $90k of additional fuel bill and nice support to oil demand. LOL!
1420 2018-09-11 21:07:03 They don’t fry the sauce in the same oil as burgers, wtf 
1421 2018-09-11 21:06:50 War is big business. Has been that way for a while. War used to be about me getting whatever you had, yeah that's still there, oil, gas, information, populations to exploit etc. But now it's also about arms and income for private corps.
1422 2018-09-11 21:06:44 C'est un homme honnête et grand travailleur que j'ai rencontré alors qu'il était auditeur à Mobil oil Kinshasa vers la fin de l'année 1989.

1426 2018-09-11 21:06:33 The Greedy Elite in the US think money is important than human lives.  The US government ignored  Terrorists who were Saudi's Because they are majors suppliers of Oil for the US.
1427 2018-09-11 21:06:18 You don't get money from gas and oil companies do you.
1428 2018-09-11 21:06:12 They went to war in a whole different country for oil & poppy fields. Parts of the building blew from the inside where no plan was even near. All this can be seen & proved.
1429 2018-09-11 21:06:01 Save at the pump and your wallet or purse! 2010 Ford Fusion Hybrid, 106k miles, fully detailed, oil changed, ready for whats ahead! $7,900
1430 2018-09-11 21:05:50 I swear my hair grows faster when I just use water and coconut oil only 
1431 2018-09-11 21:05:47 Lmao I went to Penn State. The engineering program attracts a lot of Middle Eastern students so there was a lot of sons of oil barrons and international bankers etc. They all had Lambos and shit and they'd drive past me in the rain as I walked. 
1432 2018-09-11 21:05:33 Bernie cows and people "leak" more methane than the oil and gas industry.

If you want more food build land from your own waist 
But that’s NOT why you want to kill them for food, you are killing them for money that you make from the oil they have inside them.

1442 2018-09-11 21:04:31 I just got back from PDX where I ate anything I wanted so I'll be restarting tomorrow into Keto. Using better than bouillon was one of my gotos and an occasional tablespoon of MCT oil. The diet was just slight modifications to how I already ate.
1443 2018-09-11 21:04:17 idek! Oil all over the valve-cover/everything towards the left side! It also smoked after hitting a higher speed. Thinkin’ it’s the oil cap seal or possibly the oil filter and hopefully nothing worse.
1444 2018-09-11 21:04:14 Clearly, like honesty, self-effacing humor is well beyond your ken. I know you're going to just keep posting variations of your previous tweet, because that and lies are all you've got.
1445 2018-09-11 21:04:12 Sure. Please name a viable replacement for oil. I'll wait.
1446 2018-09-11 21:04:06 Aww you poor thing. Ask your humans for a spoonful of honey and/or some coconut oil, they're both really yummy!  I had a cough for ages but turned out it wasn't the nasty kennel cough coz it went on for absolutely ages.
1447 2018-09-11 21:03:40 Yes, the oil wells in the Niger delta will take of this financial recklessness as usual.
Don't worry, Nigerians.
1448 2018-09-11 21:03:38 It is big money at its finest. Different group of people then regular working citizens. Had a conversation with a person in the oil industry years ago. He said gaddafi would be next. The chemical weapon reason was a joke from the outside to anyone....
1449 2018-09-11 21:03:26 Thats nothing, better with water in bruning oil

1451 2018-09-11 21:03:18 You realise that the Barnet Formula was to prevent Scotland running away with the oil.
1452 2018-09-11 21:03:14 Absolutely. The major US oil company heads had already planned how Iraq's oil fields would be divvied up before the invasion, with the help of the Bush WH.
1453 2018-09-11 21:03:13 Ooh Lauren is a bloody banger. That bloke with all the beard oil was leading her on. I know someone as fab as her will find the real deal and she ruddy deserve it. #FirstDatesHotel
1454 2018-09-11 21:03:12 And oil products accumulated in advance? :-)
1455 2018-09-11 21:03:08 Hard to add anything. Agreed! What if also oil goes to 90s and overshoots the majority's expectations like in rates as you're saying? Man that would rock the boat.
1456 2018-09-11 21:03:02 so police stopped a guy at around Egbeda , they ask where he was coming? from he said his dads place after searching him they collected the nylon with him and they found a black soap, water, and something like coconut oil.. immediately one shouted oga!! this one na kidnapper o
1457 2018-09-11 21:02:52 Get out of oil well.
1458 2018-09-11 21:02:51 We still have a global water crisis meaning will be trillion dollar market it will be the new oil.
1459 2018-09-11 21:02:50 I think those cars belong to the pastor, she's his side chick....and what did she do to buy 10 cars, she found oil in the desert or something?
1460 2018-09-11 21:02:45 I used to have a choice on the high street for engine oil, now it's Halfords or online, and online is winning.
1461 2018-09-11 21:02:41 I forgot that oil painting is a silky smooth pain in the ass
1462 2018-09-11 21:02:23 That look is what will this do to my investments in oil ?

1465 2018-09-11 21:01:57 Yet we still drive our cars to the gas station and fill up with their oil products. #Energyindependence
1466 2018-09-11 21:01:51 I need to take my car to get an oil change, but always feel super silly when I do. The people start asking me questions I am not sure how to answer. I need to become Vehicle Savvy. 
1467 2018-09-11 21:01:36 #Oil trying for 80 dollars again
1468 2018-09-11 21:01:34 They're not that bad, just the engine oil prices are insane.
1469 2018-09-11 21:01:18 Back to real work, I go.  I'm designing weed related products, listening to metal while vaping cannabis oil without pants on, so I guess it could be worse.

1479 2018-09-11 21:00:16 Energy must be traded in dollars. Oil or offset credits, what have you. If alternatives were allowed to manifest, the basis of dollar credit would evaporate. Enforced with massive military/arms expenditure and use — deepening credit leverage that requires more dollar hegemony.
1480 2018-09-11 21:00:16 This is a medieval prehistoric society that only has international influence because of its oil. Isolate these people from the civilized world.
1481 2018-09-11 21:00:04 I knew a girl that only topped her car up with oil when the oil light came on the dash.
1482 2018-09-11 20:59:46 Does latin america or Ireland have most of the world's oil? No. Islamic terrorism has roots in western imperialism from the post-WWI land grab following the fall of the ottoman empire. As long as oil is the world's most important resource, the west will try to control the region.

1491 2018-09-11 20:59:00 @Arron_banks that was a worldwide phenomenon due to the oil crisis but don't let facts get in the way of anything.
1492 2018-09-11 20:58:54 Vote no on oil drilling off of NC beautiful coast!!!!
1493 2018-09-11 20:58:49 You need an oil change 
1494 2018-09-11 20:58:47 That lying Zionist Jew knew what was coming! That's why he hide in the tiny highschool in Florida that day. 48 hours later he gave the green light for the Bin Laden family to leave US. The company owned by the Bush family was the first building the oil pipe from Iraq to Europe!
1495 2018-09-11 20:58:47 And then dubya used it (the inside job) as an excuse to invade iraq. Remind me again WHY we give a damn about this? We honor snakes and serpents. NOTHING was patriotic about ANY of what happened. Scumbag warmongers, thirsty for oil.
1496 2018-09-11 20:58:47 Nah nah it'll grow babes, treat it regularly with coconut oil in an overnight soak. Try those lush growth shampoos!

1498 2018-09-11 20:58:40 She's started by building the crosswalk. Now she's adding the oil and milk. I had no idea this is what a patreon went towards, y'all.
1499 2018-09-11 20:58:38 Expected investment fled Alberta, some because of NEP, some because the Oil price dropped significantly, as it did recently. I have not seen an economic analysis that separates one cause from the other. It's like blaming our recent recession on Prov Gov when oil price drops
1500 2018-09-11 20:58:34 I’m pretty sure somebody is gonna have a baby to 1st place . High vibrations and oil 
1501 2018-09-11 20:58:34 Also, it's not unusual for apartment and condo complexes to have rules against working on cars in parking lots. I could change my oil but where was I supposed to do that?
1502 2018-09-11 20:58:16 me and “people” = water and oil
1503 2018-09-11 20:58:15 Tbh I hate raw tomatoes and as the child of a southern Italian immigrant I'm apparently commiting treason. I don't mind them cooked with a bit of olive oil and basil tho!

1506 2018-09-11 20:58:03 I’ve been at the car place for 30 minutes now to get my oil changed, they haven’t even touched my car yet and when I first got here I asked how long it was gonna take and they said 30 minutes... like what?
1507 2018-09-11 20:57:50 I think you mean what the US government did to its own people to justify further raping and pillaging of Muslim countries in the pursuit of oil and opium
1508 2018-09-11 20:57:47 Idk all I do is put some oil from the middle to the ends and it pretty much always looks decent some days better than others

1510 2018-09-11 20:57:16 FR, my hand was DRIPPING in oil, I could feel my arteries closing tbh
1511 2018-09-11 20:57:04 World War II was staged and financed by the European
Royal and Elite. America’s involvement in WWII was actually
based in part upon the fact that the John D. Rockefeller and his
Oil Empire owned all the oil rights in China. After the Japanese
invaded China
1512 2018-09-11 20:56:45 its time for a new oil change 
1513 2018-09-11 20:56:44 Left my vegetable oil spread out of the fridge for too long and now it looks like a Mediterranean dip.

1516 2018-09-11 20:56:13 je ne parlais pas d'énergie fossile en remplacement du nucléaire... Ce dernier est un poison, -que vous pouvez penser propre- , il n'en demeure pas moins qu'une stratégie 100% renouvelable ( sans nucléaire et sans fossile) soit plus souhaitable..
1517 2018-09-11 20:56:07 Trump and sincere are like oil and water
1518 2018-09-11 20:55:45 Saudi Arabia will soon pay the price for the genocides, inhumanities,
beheadings of protesting students, bombing towns, hospitals, children...
The world cutting off their funding for arms.....and running out of oil...
1519 2018-09-11 20:55:41 Yeah, no crate here though & funds couldn't be any tighter Josie. The bathroom option & maybe some CBD oil are the only options. If I had a queen bed or even double, we both could fit & sleep. #sadness
1520 2018-09-11 20:55:34 Now you want to put oil workers out of a job? Never mind that your team nearly killed the coal workers! What about reducing the carbon emissions from your teams hot air and rhetoric?
1521 2018-09-11 20:55:33 اگر پچھواڑے میں Castor oil لگا دو تو بھونک "بھاو بھاو" کہ بجائے "پھُو پھُو" ہو جاتی
 
Like the recoilless launcher misfires

1522 2018-09-11 20:55:30 Might have missed the previous tweet. If you don't invest in diversity, as a thought experiment, what happens when the oil sand are done? You know oil sands are more expensive that normal drilling. Why the investment? Normal drilling is drying up. Wake up.
1523 2018-09-11 20:55:04 Flowers or come up with a knowing smile, as if only the air smelled more foreign. Styrofoam, asphalt, oil.
1524 2018-09-11 20:54:45 There's a cream for that. And an essential oil. Possibly even nail polish.
1525 2018-09-11 20:54:43 45: "Florence is going to be tremendous. The biggest hurricane maybe ever." Thanks to me ignoring climate change + propping up my Earth destroying oil + coal buddies. Let's see how much money I can spend saving the people I care so much about who are in the wake of the storm.
1526 2018-09-11 20:54:39 THIS IS ALL BECAUSE ONE ENGINE WAS LOW ON OIL AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS NO STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.
1527 2018-09-11 20:54:32 chase stein, vol. 3 after gert's death, oil on canvas
1528 2018-09-11 20:54:13 He did. This is a contingency for when you're credibly concerned about an imminent nuclear strike, not something you do because you're bored.

North Korea doesn't even have any oil.
1529 2018-09-11 20:54:09 45: "Florence is going to be tremendous. The biggest hurricane maybe ever." Thanks to me ignoring climate change + propping up my Earth destroying oil + coal buddies.

1530 2018-09-11 20:54:06 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1531 2018-09-11 20:54:06 @EPA's commonsense pollution standard safeguards God's creation, especially that of children and vulnerable populations living near oil & gas plants. These critical protections reduce exposure to harmful emissions #CutMethane #ProtectGodsCreation
1532 2018-09-11 20:54:05 Mine is a combination of 10/w30 semi synthetic engine oil and Marlboro reds. It unique, but Paving Slab is used to it.
1533 2018-09-11 20:54:03 If Lucas oil takes my poster cause it’s bigger than 11x17.... someone’s gonna have to fight
1534 2018-09-11 20:53:42 Remember it like it was yesterday. 61 now was 44 then with 3 teenagers.  My first impulse was to get the youngest from school but they had already went them home.  I thought they were going for the oil offshore if there had been more planes.  Was in Houston but born Roslyn NY.
1535 2018-09-11 20:53:41 And his beard was shiny coz he had BEARD OIL IN IT THE FUCKING TWAT. that’s like me saying my hair is natural. I hate you, Pat
1536 2018-09-11 20:53:39 I don’t think they bother to make sure they use separate oil for their fish and chicken...that’s why
1537 2018-09-11 20:53:38 To get a oil change, where I got my car from they do them for free.
1538 2018-09-11 20:53:35 Idk why I listen to ya folks about coconut oil 
1539 2018-09-11 20:53:34 They should’ve poured all of the movie theater popcorn butter into the BP oil spill hole when they had the chance to make good use of it.
1540 2018-09-11 20:53:27 Nope,  it's an Oil  field !
1541 2018-09-11 20:53:17 كذب لاتصدقون والعكس صحيح قطر في احداث سبتمبر وايران لهم اليد التي ساعدت بن لادن على احداث سبتمبر
1542 2018-09-11 20:53:04 that's not really accurate, right after Bush announced war in Iraq and many of us, me included, did everything we could to protest the invasion. we saw it as a oil grab and that is all it was. see M. Moore's Fahrenheit 911
1543 2018-09-11 20:53:02 I’m in debt, haven’t packed, still need my oil changed, my tag is expired, 100 other things, but that still doesn’t mean I’m going to tweet about how happy I’m going to be when the wkd is over. The only thing I have to look forward to is the next festival. I just want good vibes.
1544 2018-09-11 20:52:55 You can actually use alcohol to put a sick fish down. You knock them out with clove oil and then gradually remove water and increase alcohol and they'll go in their sleep. Don't know if its painless if they're awake though.
1545 2018-09-11 20:52:48 I dry swallowed a Fish Oil pill this morning and can still feel it in my esophagus. Send help
1546 2018-09-11 20:52:40 Wow take my car for an oil change and turns into not being able to have it for at least a week
1547 2018-09-11 20:52:28 Like you they also questioned without knew the fact and in fact BB returned back the olive oil and curd..
1548 2018-09-11 20:52:25 Help us get the OIL!!
1549 2018-09-11 20:52:25 I'm so sick over this. We lived in Humacao,  Dad a mngr at Sun Oil in Yabucoa where hurricane hit. People don't believe the devestation. I just posted on FB & a crude remark about PR. This was my home. Almost 3k ppl died. No remorse. Most don't care
1550 2018-09-11 20:52:12 The only reason Chavez didn’t bankrupt Venezuela earlier was due to the inflated oil prices 03-10. Meanwhile political institutions were eviscerated, media outlets suppressed, and political activists subject to numerous human rights violations. Socialist leaders never change.
1551 2018-09-11 20:52:03 Or maybe could say.. the Trump Administration today lifted punitive  regulations set on the oil and gas industry by the previous Administration
1552 2018-09-11 20:51:55 Oil , onion bread,
 See that’s all I recall! Be happy not bitter bitch
1553 2018-09-11 20:51:49 North Korea isn't oil rich.

The South China Sea isn't oil rich.
1554 2018-09-11 20:51:45 Btw, list of USA meddling across the world can go on and on. Destabilizing ME is on any rep POTUS agenda for apparent reasons of arms and oil industries. 
Just like 1953 coup or invading Iraq based on a big lie. Look at US foriegn policy against countries with high oil reserves.
1555 2018-09-11 20:51:38 PSA: Pour some vegetable oil around your house so when Florence rolls up he slips and falls. This will in turn cause him to stop.
1556 2018-09-11 20:51:20 Sirji, we are still cheapest amount crude oil producing countries...... Plz compare and get back to me if have guts
1557 2018-09-11 20:51:20 People think they woke saying their cars run on dinosaurs. Oil is from raw plant matter that’s about two to three times as old as the Jurassic period. By our estimations humans will have blown up the earth by the time anything that lived along dinosaurs become petroleum
1558 2018-09-11 20:51:02 wow, it seems more simple to make than I thought, lots of basil leaves, a few cloves of garlic, olive oil, parmesan cheese and pine or walnuts, put in a blinder and bam! you have a delightful pesto sauce
1559 2018-09-11 20:50:53 I know — once you get that oil money, your head’s gone. I’m sure you laughed at Champions League Finals before Mansour! 
1560 2018-09-11 20:50:53 It was a bad day. It was a fucked up inside job that took a lot of innocent peoples’ lives just so that it could start tension with a foreign nation so it would seem rational for us to go fuck them up and take their oil and cover up Bush’s bullshit. God bless the dead.
1561 2018-09-11 20:50:53 I knowwww! It has the quote, “She’s where the oil can’t hurt her now” on it. 
1562 2018-09-11 20:50:50 The Philly Phanatic could have coached this years squad to a better record than ole coconut oil Kapler #Phillies
1563 2018-09-11 20:50:49 Hardly a word regarding Yemen, so obvious that all MSM are controlled by SA who control oil and place huge arms deals with May, disgraceful hypocritical and inhumane

1565 2018-09-11 20:50:46 SAYORI NO WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME SHE USED JASMINE OIL
1566 2018-09-11 20:50:45 Thanks Mark! He was down The Bwthyn off Coity Rd today. My Mam said he had a big smile and was covered in oil after his massages and reflexology!
1567 2018-09-11 20:50:44 Bloody hell, for a minute I thought Anglo African Oil & Gas had rocked up!
1568 2018-09-11 20:50:41 ha! Have you watched the 'Thin Ice' episode of Madame Secretary? Plot involves State Dept Expo for renewable energy, after budget cuts, being sponsored by 'big oil & gas'  :)
1569 2018-09-11 20:50:36 I’m going oil for the last days girl. I need that tan or home will be even more depressing 
1570 2018-09-11 20:50:27 Otedola is about to be in for a whole new different game as he will be bombarded with stories from the media from tax to maybe expiration of oil blocks yen yen yen whatever stories to put him off
1571 2018-09-11 20:50:23 I've discovered that Marmite & sesame oil combined with a fairly arbitrary assortment of spices and seasonings amounts to a pretty reasonable broth/soup approximation when diluted with boiling water. Wow it's lazy.
1572 2018-09-11 20:50:20 You need CBD Oil....
1573 2018-09-11 20:50:18 I change my own oil I’m basically a mechanic
1574 2018-09-11 20:50:13 Oil is higher after the API weekly data shows bigger than expected drawdown… it also shows a buildup in gasoline and distillates. All eyes on the Energy Information Administration (EIA) weekly report tomorrow at 10:30 am EDT
1575 2018-09-11 20:50:02 I would gladly be the one to apply that thin layer of oil to make him nice and shiny.
1576 2018-09-11 20:49:49 Quality wise... As oil is not my background I couldn't challenge him, besides He owns quite a few shell petrol stations in Kenya.. Chances are he knows a thing of two about oil
1577 2018-09-11 20:49:46 FIRE COCONUT OIL GABE
1578 2018-09-11 20:49:38 Also got homework:
"Take your Shinai apart, oil it, put it back together. If you can't manage, bring the individual parts and we'll put them back together. If you manage, it'll probably be wrong. I'll tear it apart and we'll put them back together." XD
1579 2018-09-11 20:49:38 Trump troll. My tax cuts were eaten up by higher gas prices, higher oil prices, higher prices on products driven by Trump's tariff war.  You don't think your tax dollars are paying for Trump's record deficit?  #GetOffTheTrumpTrain
1580 2018-09-11 20:49:36 you proud of this one?
1581 2018-09-11 20:49:34 Why does West Virginia do so much better than Pennsylvania in both crude oil and natural gas ?
1582 2018-09-11 20:49:23 "Does Aigis drink oil, or do you have to put it in somewhere. Like her butt or her ya know."
1583 2018-09-11 20:49:23 It’s amazing. I have a herniated disk and it’s great. Make sure you get the higher quality oil or it’s not going to have the same potency. Also helps me with any minor anxiety I may have at the time. Also doesn’t mess with gut flora to allow for additional help from your body
1584 2018-09-11 20:49:12 They don’t make sure they use seperate oil for the fish and chicken
1585 2018-09-11 20:49:09 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
1586 2018-09-11 20:48:58 I served in bayelsa and Shell would lay pipelines, they carry out their cooperate social responsibility as demanded by the government. Indigens vandalize pipelines so that the government will blame Shell for oil spills
1587 2018-09-11 20:48:54 I just wanna oil up @cherokeedassxxx ass one time. Ok maybe like ten times....but yeah 
1588 2018-09-11 20:48:52 @FMPWH @tundefashola @ProfOsinbajo @atiku @ProfOsinbajo @MBuhari @NGRSenate I leave in port Harcourt oil city and have no meter, less than 4 days power supply a month, and so much money be been spent on power over d years. @OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg

1590 2018-09-11 20:48:40 Looks like Carole had one foot on motor oil & the other on a banana  skin. Grim reaper about to serve her the papers.  liberals!!!!
1591 2018-09-11 20:48:30 Serious question:
Who has experience with CBD oil for dogs?
I need guidance.
1592 2018-09-11 20:47:56 We can’t accept bribery that undermines our country: Tom Cotton-rep from Ark took almost $1 million from Israel to stop Iran Nuclear Agreement! Repugs accept huge amounts-big oil, NRA, insurance D Young IA to end “pre-existing illness” from health ins! Ass!! Pharma Corp etc
1593 2018-09-11 20:47:52 i’m so backed up on snot that if we used snot instead of oil the US military would be invading my sinuses
1594 2018-09-11 20:47:51 Oil and other white products or foodstuffs.
1595 2018-09-11 20:47:28 @nafta Walk away we shouldn't be BULLIED.  WEcan deal with EU and CHINA forget NAFTA we still have oil raise tarriffs on oil to USA incrementally until they stop playing hard ball 35 states depend on Canada.
1596 2018-09-11 20:47:20 Just imagining that ol' timey Milkman service, but with that extra virgin "alive" oil...
1597 2018-09-11 20:47:18 Totally agree. New entrants to the market like @PersonalCapital and @Betterment have socially responsible strategies that exclude coal and oil, and arms manufacturers as well.
1598 2018-09-11 20:47:17 finally Let’s not forget all the innocent people in Iraq killed for gold and oil
1599 2018-09-11 20:47:14 It's a catch 22,
Many of these issues are direct reactions of the treaties post WW1, the Oil chase of post WW2, and the intervention/nation building of 1960-today.  Unfortunately, the west created this.
1600 2018-09-11 20:47:12 The painting you are referring to was done largely alla prima, with some blocking in to begin with. I mixed some of the colours on the canvas. I tend to thin my paint (oil) with siccative. Hope that helps.
1601 2018-09-11 20:46:59 By the way, I’m wearing my Rest In Peace Becky shirt. An ode to Becky the duck who was senselessly murdered in an oil accident.
1602 2018-09-11 20:46:52 Triangles! Everywhere there’s triangles! Satellites watch you go to the bathroom in public and private! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

1604 2018-09-11 20:46:38 Also the eggs won’t make your hair smell bad at all because almond oil masks it’s scent and it smells so good so your hair will literally smell like heaven
1605 2018-09-11 20:46:36 I am overwhelmed to the point of screaming as a soy-free person who needs coconutMCT oil (or powder?!) to supplement some of the dairy in my ketogenic diet that controls my seizures. I'm not "keto" or "paleo". Taking brand recommendations. I want to take in cofee and tea.
1606 2018-09-11 20:46:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
1607 2018-09-11 20:46:33 Oil & gas technology. Aviation. Pharmaceuticals. Pulses. Grain. Lumber. Autos and the list goes on and on. Canadians shouldn't be taken for granted

1609 2018-09-11 20:46:25 That's insane. I haven't had Pizza Hut in years because it's so greasy over here for some reason. I know pizza is meant to be greasy, but most of the PH I get is like they've slathered oil over the entire pizza!

1611 2018-09-11 20:46:19 out of short on #EURUSD....... Pivot @ 1.15809 support not ready to let it go down just yet. Could rip up with the massive draw on oil that should push the dollar down
1612 2018-09-11 20:46:19 The recipes have been finalized,  O & V Tasting Room will be launching 2 new blends of olive oil over the next couple days - Stop in and give them a try! If you love them, they can bottle you up some to take home and enjoy! #villageontheriver #hespelervillage #shoplocal
1613 2018-09-11 20:46:13 Good luck to her. RA sucks. I tried extracted CBD oil without much success, I smoke flower.
1614 2018-09-11 20:46:01 I am going to attempt eggless chocolate chip cookies. My chocolates chip freaking melted in the 5 minute car ride home. I forgot butter (I guess I could use coconut oil but I’m already not using eggs)
1615 2018-09-11 20:45:52 With eggs....hello?
Fry the eggs with the oil.
1616 2018-09-11 20:45:40 So wait a minute, it was the Russian oil companies now? Wow are you folks deluded. Just think we will have 6 more years of this to laugh at you.
1617 2018-09-11 20:45:22 Okay bossi ya amar I use two. 
Awel wahed: 2 eggs, 2 spoons almond oil, and 1 spoon honey. Depending on the length of your hair the ratio of oil to honey is 2:1 
Tani wahed: 1 yogurt, 2 spoons coconut oil, and 1 honey (2:1)
1618 2018-09-11 20:45:08 Scotland’s future spent

1622 2018-09-11 20:44:30 @egoldie80 Mail people also work on automated machines that sort mail. Machines that have grease and oil.
1623 2018-09-11 20:44:23 Looking forward to welcoming the Rainbow Warrior to Princes Wharf in Auckland at Princes Wharf at 10am. The Warrior links the battle against the French Govt over nuclear testing to the battle against oil companies over climate change.
1624 2018-09-11 20:44:22 Think Tanks, Legacy Millionaires, a corp that owns building supplies, oil business, paper products, and chem/fertilizer...ALL ROLLED INTO ONE...some say Koch Industries?
1625 2018-09-11 20:44:10 Bought some CBD oil. Gonna see if this helps my MDD and PTSD. I'll come back with results soon.
1626 2018-09-11 20:44:06 We also learn that the American government are gready bastards and would kill 3000 people for a bit of oil...
1627 2018-09-11 20:43:55 CBD oil is just a type of #cannabis oil. To be legal in the UK as an 'exempt product' it has to be within limits
1628 2018-09-11 20:43:46 Funny how a lot of these countries have oil. Funny how external countries are often meddling in order to get access to that oil. Wierd.

1630 2018-09-11 20:43:24 As long as we use palm oil in the vast and wasteful ways that we do then deforestation is not going to stop. 'Every little helps'...unless you are an orangutan, a Sumatran tiger, a Javan rhino, a pygmy elephant, a sun bear, a gibbon or .... the list is a long one.
1631 2018-09-11 20:43:22 My favorite essential oil is bacon grease.

1635 2018-09-11 20:42:57 Mane Choice products- the growth oil is good. I stopped using coconut oil made my hair super dry... I been also using Indian hair growth oils
1636 2018-09-11 20:42:50 These betters of ours would be horrified if expected to live on a measly couple of million a year. Almost as laughable as being told by a multi millionaire that money is not important.

1639 2018-09-11 20:42:35 It's every Americans duty on this day to center the remembrance of this tragedy on the self, so as to distract from the fact that interventionist American policy in the Middle East created political unrest all in the name of private oil interests.

1646 2018-09-11 20:41:48 Osama bin Laden's dad was best friends with the founder of Saudi Arabia and started a multi-billion dollar construction and oil company that funded al-Qaeda and you're telling me the US should align itself with Saudi Arabia and against Iran
1647 2018-09-11 20:41:46 Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala has decided to proceed ahead with an initial public offering for its Spanish #oil firm @Cepsa in what could be the largest energy IPO in 10 years -- more on @TheTerminal with @RuthsDavid and @DNair5 #OOTT
1648 2018-09-11 20:41:37 expecting some weakness in oil or CAD data ?? or techs ??
1649 2018-09-11 20:41:17 It's called a resource curse..The politicians can benefit from oil directly hence they don't need the country to work in order to live on.
1650 2018-09-11 20:40:44 You’re being paid Mossad and the stolen oil money to say this.

1652 2018-09-11 20:40:30 This ridiculous myth has a life of its own and no amount of logic, science or history will quell it... in the 1970’s we were worried about a coming ice age and running out of oil.

1656 2018-09-11 20:40:10 Sadly what it brings to mind for me is when the GOP used the death of our country men to invaded a country for their oil. Now they're killing thousands more here & aboard. GOP has allowed almost 3k citizens die after a hurricane & trying to slowly kill thousands more of us.

1674 2018-09-11 20:38:35 This was well calculated... Fry a few high profile individuals so when we implement oil products taxes, we go 'but we fighting corruption more than any other government has ever done!'..Kuria confirmed it tonight. We see you ! #NewsNight

1677 2018-09-11 20:38:26 The war we are fighting is on multiple fronts. The GOP’s primary attack is on Planet Earth.

1684 2018-09-11 20:37:39 He did not invade Iraq to put oil in Bush family hands, he did not allow it to happen and today is NOT a day for using 9/11 to launch partisan attacks.
1685 2018-09-11 20:37:39 We have plenty of oil. Wasn't oil. Was to change completely govts, nations infrastructure.
1686 2018-09-11 20:37:39 Counting anyone who died through February  inflates death toll.

1694 2018-09-11 20:37:07 Agree.

I was using Tesla as a brand-name, not referencing the scientist, my bad.

Having watched the tech for decades (heard abt hydrogen fuel cells c2000), I’m wary of the influence of oil money in tech devt.
They suppressed patents for decades.
1695 2018-09-11 20:37:05 At least they are American - according to the same laws that allow Oil Companies to pay off Trump and the GOP, they can do what they want with their money. But foreign governments, like Russia, that is a whole different story, and why Jr is likely going to prison soon.
1696 2018-09-11 20:36:40 It’s a logistics thing though. We are stuck selling oil to the states as we never diversified. Going to take a while for the pipelines. What other products are in high demand?

But, seperating algae frm water is a bitch, not to mention extracting the oil. U have solutions for that too?

First used “global warming” which was ineffective, so pivoted to “climate change” to frighten the masses.
1780 2018-09-11 20:28:13 Thanks! Question tho - if the portland sots directly above the KIM and Portland bopd is not that impressive what makes you think KIM will be better - im not experienced in oil exploration so excuse my ignorance but for me this is a valid question
1781 2018-09-11 20:28:13 Interesting, although it’s not clear to me how much the Browns now profit from Indonesian oil imports. 

Meanwhile, the steam tube failures that led to the SONGS decom seem to be a symptom of poor risk management.

1783 2018-09-11 20:27:52 It was my pleasure to met you yesterday. We had a good discussion about GCC oil production vs. American oil production companies. Hope to see you again in Doha in similar events.

1788 2018-09-11 20:27:22 #TipTuesday: Popcorn is a great snack as long as you don't put a lot of salt and butter on it. Try sprinkling parmesan cheese, lemon flavor fish oil, or alternative salt. Any one of these will give your popcorn flavor.

1798 2018-09-11 20:26:12 Tenterhooks are hooks in a device called a tenter. Tenters were originally large wooden frames which were used as far back as the 14th century in the process of making woollen cloth. After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained oil and dirt from the fleece. Wikipedia
1799 2018-09-11 20:26:04 It is a dead end bro. If as Governor you could not oil structures and become a movement on your own, Just pack your bags and leave when your tenure is done. He would lose woefully at the primaries. 

Best bet is to leave after May 29.

1825 2018-09-11 20:21:53 With over 30% of Americans gullible or self-interested enough to buy his snake oil, the delusional cons, from this unprincipled shyster, will never stop.
1826 2018-09-11 20:21:43 yea, PDP already has the southern oil producing states for that, but the idea is to make both parties more competitive... Politics is politics, i'm not looking for a saint, i just understand that competition & opposition makes politicians perform better 
1827 2018-09-11 20:21:40 Lagos had a head start even before 1999,it was a capital at a crucial time in Nigeria's history(oil boom) in addition to the sitting of Nigeria's only functioning port. Lagosians deserve better.

1831 2018-09-11 20:21:23 So it really is about the oilsands. No need to worry about contagen. I wonder when activists or natives will  take legal action or otherwise to shut down  "oil" trains .
1832 2018-09-11 20:21:22 Why don't I go?  Because the current ventures on the islands related to oil are something I don't think will take off.
Also, I don't have the capital to make a major investment.

1841 2018-09-11 20:19:59 The Federal Reserve know eventually they have to returned to such a format. Without the Petro Dollar being backed by oil and gas,no one will want these greenbacks outside the States. Countries are buying PMs with their USDs in their treasuries. Tons of it

1848 2018-09-11 20:18:49 Quite brilliant: Make the EU strategic energy reserve tech neutral.

"With gas becoming more important than oil, it would make absolutely no sense to close European gas storage capacity while continuing to have large strategic oil stocks that are very seldom used."

Count me in!
1849 2018-09-11 20:17:58 I washed my new cast iron skillet last night. I read online that after washing it, I should wipe it down with some vegetable oil. So I did. Later, I went back out into the kitchen and saw one of the cats sitting on the stove, licking off the oil with absolutely no shame

Here's what I'm getting:
1855 2018-09-11 20:17:26 I hate coming to the mechanic shop so much that I’m about to learn how to change my own oil.

1857 2018-09-11 20:17:15 Whatever @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump talk about oil! @BMWsaudiarabia
1858 2018-09-11 20:17:13 Lee, you know as well as anyone, we are PAST the point of asking "why" - we KNOW why, the real question is how do we destabilize the powerful wealthy oligarchs who CHOOSE wealth & power over protecting the lives of innocent human beings who happen to live near oil or socialism?!
1859 2018-09-11 20:16:56 Livid with my cat ! Put Moroccan oil on him so he smelt amazing and he’s just come in my room smelling of horse shit  why do I even bother

1864 2018-09-11 20:16:24 His "rudeness" will hopefully wake voters up and help us secure a better future. And I think his tweet addresses the lawmakers, for shirking their duty and bowing to the god of oil and money, not potential storm victims. I. My opinion.
1865 2018-09-11 20:16:23 Why does the US Crude Oil Industry actively oppose The “RENEWABLE” BioFuel Industry’s ability to provide 15% Of USA’s gasoline needs ?
1866 2018-09-11 20:16:11 All the thriving oil companies will be shelling out big time for tickets to every event it’ll be great, Oh wait... #Notmygames
1867 2018-09-11 20:16:10 The problem with Nigeria presently isn't with the present administration or the one before but it all started with those leaders who decided "let's just face crude oil, every other thing is a waste of time"... And got worse as we continued bringing foresightless men into power.
1868 2018-09-11 20:15:54 dm me your fav tanning oil
1869 2018-09-11 20:15:47 a load of rubbish not good enough needs start pending oil revenue on people rather than spending in the proxy war in Syria.

1872 2018-09-11 20:15:18 In Iron Man 3, the bad guy refers to the ship (that the president is tied up on) as an oil tanker, yet it is quite clearly a container vessel, and is being loaded by the cranes as such.

1876 2018-09-11 20:14:49 Why does not govts keep a fixed amt rather than fixed rate of excise duty on petrol  like rs 15/- per lt instead of say 45%.How can govt justify additional revenue even if rise in  internation crude oil is justified #BharatBandh #petrol #PetrolDieselPriceHike
1877 2018-09-11 20:14:22 What was crude oil price then?

1889 2018-09-11 20:13:06 maybe it takes an hour and a half to get my oil changed because they wait for 70 minutes then do it in 20
1890 2018-09-11 20:13:01 The thing is most Americans may never know.  We were told it was for the possession of weapons of mass destruction but the war in the Middle East for power has been going on for as long as they’ve had religion and they live on oil we all want.

1895 2018-09-11 20:11:48 There were too many institutions benefitting from the Al Said oil bonanza. Count all the Saudi chairs in universities. Do you think they are providing the whole truth about Islam or Saudi Arabia in our universities? Glad I did my own research!!

1899 2018-09-11 20:11:31 Dundee had  an open goal with oil industry years ago and messed it up. V&A Dundee is fast becoming iconic but needs space to breathe & be seen . Don’t screw it up again by surrounding it with generic office buildings.

1904 2018-09-11 20:10:20 In terms of dependence, US private, profitable industries, like the oil industry, use our federal tax code to benefit from subsidies.  The Farm Bill , which the @GOP loves to support, provides farmers subsidies to keep domestic food prices low. Both are forms of socialism.

I remember sitting on my couch crying like a baby when those bombs were first dropping on the city of Baghdad...It was a wholesale slaughter that has lasted forever. Just for theft of oil!
1910 2018-09-11 20:09:46 It depends on if he means their shampoo/conditioner 

I can tell you I've never seen actual hair shampoo recommended for use on your facial hair (because it messes with the PH balance)

Again you'll be fine, hell you can probably keep using every 2-3 days as long as you oil
1911 2018-09-11 20:09:35 Good reason to drain every dead fish for their precious oil! #killallfish #twentytwentyeight #apocalypse2028 #murdereverythingwithgills

1913 2018-09-11 20:09:33 SIGNAL N°229 - Stratégie fondamentale: Demain, c'est MARATHON OIL (NYSE: $MRO) que nous ajouterons à notre portefeuille US. Cette position est, une fois de plus, assez risquée.

1914 2018-09-11 20:09:30 Remembering the victims of 9/11 

But can we also pray for the Millions of Iraqi and Afghani citizens, including children, who were murdered as a result of 9/11 being used as an excuse to invade for oil...
1915 2018-09-11 20:09:25 Preferential supply to competing nations helps keep cost of oil down for US/Canadian production.

I probably should have just said the west.
1916 2018-09-11 20:09:25 Not that I can share with any confidence...in the early years I was fairly wide ranging with investments...then for 12 yrs I was purely oil..big returns but lots of cash burnt along the way inc on SB’s 

Last 3-4 yrs I’ve been on a more sensible roll..I’ll report at y/e 
1917 2018-09-11 20:09:21 #DelusionalDon   we are in deep. GOP want tax cuts for the wealthy and to keep taking  away health care from all, while they build war machines to destroy the  earth 10 thousand times over and ruin the skies and seas with pollution  they can drill from earth oil which they stole
1918 2018-09-11 20:09:07 McDonalds also don’t really separate their friers and their utensils, so they don’t guarantee that the oil they used to fry your fish fillet hadn’t been used to fry any other ingredients (including the meat patties) and the utensils they used hadn’t touched any other meal.
1919 2018-09-11 20:09:02 Same here. I hope he uses holy oil after he’s done cutting your hair.
1920 2018-09-11 20:08:59 @ian_mendes @TSNSimmer Guys, I believe we saw the snake oil show last night.
1921 2018-09-11 20:08:54 Anyone out there in the southwest able to recommend a plummer who is qualified to work with oil? #need a new tank installed...

1925 2018-09-11 20:08:20 Venezuela has oil and they went down the pan. What do we have?  How is this Mogg plan going to work for everyone else who isn’t named ‘Mogg with offshore investment’. #scam #shameful
1926 2018-09-11 20:08:19 O.D.B.'s EPA proposes weaker methane rules for oil and gas wells
1927 2018-09-11 20:08:14 I put it in a bath the night before I had Emie and had it in an oil burner during labour. I now strongly advice you do not try either of those 
1928 2018-09-11 20:08:14 Peppermint oil! Literal god send for migraines
1929 2018-09-11 20:08:07 But, it depends on your belief as what is halal. As far as I know, McDonalds fries with vegetable oil, so no problem with the oil (if it’s fried with lard, it will turn out haram).
1930 2018-09-11 20:08:03 Alguien véndeme un oil pls
1931 2018-09-11 20:07:50 Pls what can he do to the state he better sitdown  and b enjoying  is oil money

1933 2018-09-11 20:07:33 There's oil in the Golan Heights... That's why #ISIL was created.
1934 2018-09-11 20:07:31  I’m sorry, but I have to drown my sand which with mayo and oil at Jimmy Johns
1935 2018-09-11 20:07:24 Even use lavender oil. Get crystals that better protect empaths. I have an article somewhere. It will serve you well. Even the quartz combo. Smokey..rose..clear cut. Put in your home. Any dealing with neg or used more frequently...NEED to be cleansed more often
1936 2018-09-11 20:07:01 In my world cowardice is much worse than mocking. In fact you have to be able to take mocking if you want to make it in the oil field. But cowardice can get someone killed.  The reporter cowardly retracted his article.
1937 2018-09-11 20:07:00 Yeah. They sell razor oil for those my dude.
1938 2018-09-11 20:07:00 all the health issues. thinks as she has come from sky. dbreaks rules, special milk, special oil, speaks englosh wont jump in swimming pool, wont do sacrifice for others, helps north indian girls mainly yashika and aishwarya. always says bachha beta a
1939 2018-09-11 20:06:42 I literally just witnessed a Mexican looking guy with a huge mustache videoing himself explaining how to check the oil in his mini van in the advanced auto parking lot
1940 2018-09-11 20:06:37 In other adulting adventure news- I’m getting my oil changed today. Look at me go!

1946 2018-09-11 20:06:07 i could literally drink olive oil and balsamic vinegar together
1947 2018-09-11 20:06:01 Even if scots vote for it we will still have to fight for it.
They wont take the will of the Scottish people maturely like a democratic parly.
They will stoke division between scots and English before they let scots go.
Although if we gave them the oil we would be indy by Friday
1948 2018-09-11 20:05:53 Bro I'm attending the Quebec Oil Gas conference end of October , I need to look like a sharp shooter. My job is trading / investing
1949 2018-09-11 20:05:53 My comment was based on my professional experience as a contracts specialist in oil and gas sector. Schlumberger or Baker Hughes will never execute a contract without a review by their legal department. Most local companies sign without reading the terms and conditions.
1950 2018-09-11 20:05:48 Honestly I just need a girlfriend so I can have someone to put a dip in my lip when my hands are covered in grease/oil
1951 2018-09-11 20:05:46 But what about all the CO2 oil will liberate?!?!?!?

Oh yeah, CO2 is plant food. 

Sorry, as you were.

1955 2018-09-11 20:05:27 She was extremely fortunate to have the North Sea oil revenues to bolster her economics. High unemployment, civil unrest,the family silver sold off and high interest rates is not my idea of dragging the uk up to a better life and millions like me would agree

1958 2018-09-11 20:05:03 Petavsa is already not paying their bills, now the government of President Nicolas Maduro is tapping the state oil company for additional government income, but the move will further affect the company’s long-term stability.

1963 2018-09-11 20:04:34 You know what else they say that's utter bullshit? That herds of grazing animals cause climate change. Big Oil infiltrated all of the big environmental and animal rights orgs years ago.
1964 2018-09-11 20:04:27 It’ll most likely grow back, that happened to me bc I also am a dumb bitch. It got so much better when I started using teatree oil on it tho

you're not going to have your face and beard suddenly fall out because you used shampoo. it's healthier to clean it than to leave gunk a grime in it lol
1967 2018-09-11 20:04:10 Manlet, No jawline, emtionally weak. Gonna need a lot more than olive oil to want to be you brah
1968 2018-09-11 20:04:08 I can assure you many women lost jobs in the oil and gas sector in the past three years.  I am personally related to three and am friends with several more!  Women may not all be doing heavy lifting jobs but they are working in the oils and gas industry in a number of areas.
1969 2018-09-11 20:03:50 Ok I’m completely sold on the HiShine Hot Oil coat treatment for horses. Both mine are either growing out a clip or shedding like beasts but after doing them on the weekend they’re soft and smooth and silky .
1970 2018-09-11 20:03:48 I recently had a patient admitted to hospital from marijuana oil overdose, which 'never happens' according to the marijuana lobby.

1972 2018-09-11 20:03:33 These inquiry driven science experiments explore the properties of materials are amazing. We’ve learnt how oil and water don’t mix by making lava lamps, how to move water using towelette, properties of aluminum and more. Step aside Dr Karl. Here comes 4C!
1973 2018-09-11 20:03:24 Just check your oil and your tires before you go 
And if you’re worried take like half hour breaks xx
1974 2018-09-11 20:03:16 Equity markets were in a positive mood, the S&P500 currently up 0.5%. Bond yields also rose, helped by some upbeat US economic data. A slightly firmer US dollar kept AUD and NZD under pressure. Oil prices jumped 2.5% as US hurricane Florence approached the east coast.

i rub the extra oil from my palms onto my face at night before bed, it leaves it super soft. is that weird/wrong?
1977 2018-09-11 20:02:45 We all should back Native Americans in stopping the Keystone Pipeline. Enough of this caca from Big Oil.
1978 2018-09-11 20:02:36 @RepTedYoho any reduction in overall spending in program? Less people on it should result in smaller budget
1979 2018-09-11 20:02:36 I’m from around Lima freaking Ohio and people were convinced we were in danger cuz there’s an oil refinery there.
1980 2018-09-11 20:02:34 My skin produces so much oil bruh
1981 2018-09-11 20:02:24 He is a snake oil salesman and he is so full of shit that his eyeballs floats!!! Don’t forget the hookers were for recruits!!!

1983 2018-09-11 20:02:23 Boy I sure could use a couple cold ones right now, @Kaufer33 got blackout drunk and pissed in my gas tank again and boom boom checked my oil (if you know what Im sayin!)
1984 2018-09-11 20:02:00 The missus is only looking to turn on the heating. Something telling me I'll have to turn it off at the oil tank itself.
1985 2018-09-11 20:01:57 They should discuss how to stop illegal guns, gangs, illegal border crossers receiving taxpayer $$ & how to stop that, trans mountain, getting oil to markets, nafta & what’s best for Canadians
1986 2018-09-11 20:01:50 Don’t know if I call u idiot or not. Every govt who bothered of unaffordable oil price had issued  such bonds in past. check on ur vajpayees time.
1987 2018-09-11 20:01:50 My understand of Venezuela's situation is that it's complex, much of it stemming from the fact that their economy is tightly tied to oil. Chavez and Maduro were reportedly corrupt or incompetent, and have hugely mismanaged their economy. That's my understanding, anyway, but IDK.
1988 2018-09-11 20:01:41 Why do you continue to supply Canada with foreign oil?
1989 2018-09-11 20:01:28 I was going to be productive today and get my oil changed and as soon as I pulled up to the place my brain was like, “um we actually don’t want to do this”. So I drove home. Now, who wants to hang out lol

1993 2018-09-11 20:01:09 Narcissists and empaths never work. I don't like saying that. But unfortunately it's the truth. They're like oil and water. I think it's more of the fact that we see through the bull they think they're selling. It irks us.
1994 2018-09-11 20:01:04 You would rather support the super wealthy oil and coal company’s than believe in science. Fake as hell bro

1997 2018-09-11 20:00:40 Saw them last night and had a quick look. Couldn’t readily locate the protein content on the packaging (odd for a “protein bar,” they typically have that front & centre) and certainly the calorie, fat and sugar content were consistent with...a big choccie bar.

Pure snake oil.
1998 2018-09-11 20:00:39 What else is a common carrier? Airlines, freight trains, the trucking industry, bus service, UPS, USPS, Fedex, oil pipelines and more. 

Common carrier rules are why freight companies can't not ship gun companies' products and why Delta can't ban you for your political opinion
1999 2018-09-11 20:00:28 And where is the money coming from, the magic money tree..?? Perhaps for an budget that reflects all oil revenues and enables investment in green energy?? Or perhaps #indyref2

2002 2018-09-11 20:00:19 Just a few minutes ago, I saw 3 truckloads of oil well casing headed to South Texas from our local steel mill.  It’s been a long, long time since I’ve seen that.  Things are looking up folks!
2003 2018-09-11 20:00:13 A tip for you. Only ever half full your tank unless it’s a v long journey. Check your tyres.  Don’t overfill with oil or like me you’ll have a cloud behind you.
2004 2018-09-11 20:00:06 It just occurred to me as I sit in the waiting room of my auto service center that this will be my last oil change. #tesla #model3 #deliveryin2weeks
2005 2018-09-11 20:00:04 So you regulate/nationalize social media, but not oil or Wall Street? Cool priorities.
2006 2018-09-11 20:00:00 There’s a special place in hell for people who overtightned oil filters......
2007 2018-09-11 19:59:52 You was on a  and worried about sharks??? I’d have mentioned whales, oil leaks, low fuel, and pirates. You’ve got a good man.
2008 2018-09-11 19:59:47 Application fees are the biggest scam since snake oil salesmen
2009 2018-09-11 19:59:40 I can't stand when a hairdresser asks me about my current products. I can say I only slather my hair in ultra rare coconut oil and she'll still find a way to pick it apart.
2010 2018-09-11 19:59:35 Exactly. 1988 Olympics didn’t increase those things, the city growth & oil boom did.

2016 2018-09-11 19:58:12 It does, though cheaper oil would have helped the bus companies. Ownership (state v private) isn't really the issue, though different parts of the state employing lawyers to argue against each other was absurd. Real issue was that the 'regulated' system successfully stifled
2017 2018-09-11 19:58:08 I guess west Texas oil money wants to see 8-5 seasons and flying tortillas.
2018 2018-09-11 19:58:07 The key is to dress the greens with lemon juice and olive oil and then the runny yolks add to it.
2019 2018-09-11 19:58:03 Hey
Could you tell person responsible for package that in French it's "Huile" and not "L'huile". L'huile is "the oil" which doesn't make sense in the context...

2021 2018-09-11 19:57:56 Look, you're not trying, okay?

So, take these two salt shakers...no, forget that.

Think of lettuce. A head of lettuce. And a banana. One is green, and the other...the other is...

Okay, I got nothing.
2022 2018-09-11 19:57:55 In Italy they have carbs in MUCH smaller portions than in imitation Italian restaurants in the UK and US. They also consume more healthy fats from olive oil and fish, rely much less on sugar for energy, and crucially, appreciate quality food instead of stuffing their faces 24/7
2023 2018-09-11 19:57:53 It was soooo good. I love my lime olive oil and vinaigrette.  Plus the hubby and I had a wonderful date at your establishment back in February.

2025 2018-09-11 19:57:27 Barbara hits that on the nail, but we need to go further, b/c climate chaos is changing the playing field in the Pacific, for ALL of us - NZ is not immune.

Climate Refugees are already a thing (Syria is a war of depleted resources due to drought & failing oil reserves).
2026 2018-09-11 19:57:01 @HalfManHalfBrgr tonite - Burger arrived cold. Asked Waitress to reheat. 15 mins later burger arrives cold again. waitress picked up burger To confirm it was cold & dripped oil and fat from the burger onto my shirt. All except for me had a meal. Can you refund my dry cleaning? 
2027 2018-09-11 19:57:00 My diet involves not eating sugar ,carb and oil,can't eat after 6pm ,take tea in the morning,and light food at nite ,Make mi fit diet
2028 2018-09-11 19:56:54 Is it me or are things in our lives getting more expensive?
Our grocery bill today was 26k and we still have sugar, oil, soaps and daals left to buy.
My mother likes to break down her grocery list into 2 different stores. Apparently some daal and cheeni issue. But still. 
Daymn.
2029 2018-09-11 19:56:42 Back from an oil change, lunch with a friend that I haven't seen since 2003 and now I'm back~ Just finished cutting the grass (again?) Grows like a child! Just getting HOT out there too!
2030 2018-09-11 19:56:41 @Plaid_Turkey and @Plaid_Sudan have signed a $100 million oil exploration deal and an agreement allocating thousands of square miles of Sudanese agricultural land for investment by Turkish companies. @Plaid_Erdogan nice doing business with you.
2031 2018-09-11 19:56:41 Wine bottles can be classy tho. the real masters of style save olive oil bottles (which can be oddly gorgeous in design, for whatever reason lol)
2032 2018-09-11 19:56:30 9/11 was an inside job to fuel America's thirst for war. We illegally invaded two countries under the guise of "war against terrorism" to steal their oil reserves and poppy fields. There is also currently an opoid crisis in America. Go figure
2033 2018-09-11 19:56:30 I have a huge thing of olive oil and coconut oil at home , no canola, vegetable or corn oils allowed in my house

2036 2018-09-11 19:56:16 Misery. A society accustomed to live w oil income. They must have recovered no more than 5-10% of the OOIP. To recover up to 30% they must use steam at high temperature, cost 60U$/Bbl.Today unviable. Goodbye oil rent, maybe for a very long time or forever without new reservoirs.

2039 2018-09-11 19:55:52 Infrastructure spending will have obvious multiplier effects in the economy as we tend to import our oil which is produced elsewhere. Ultimately moving away from fossil fuels will have obvious economic benefits as well as the environmental ones
2040 2018-09-11 19:55:51 Ask them if the tax cuts and regulation cuts for big oil have lowered the cost to fill up their tanks.   Cause it's definitely making the rich richer....
2041 2018-09-11 19:55:48 And Abu Ghraib, Gitmo, Egypt, Extradition, covert shenanigans just made it easier to recruit people increasingly ready to see the US as the bad guys. I know it hurt, it still hurts... But Osama is gone, now its Daesh. But every misstep, every corruption oil deals, private armies
2042 2018-09-11 19:55:31 Putting some of that cbd oil up in my salad maybe some raisins...
2043 2018-09-11 19:55:31 Iran has reduced its output while India, France and South Korea search for alternative sellers. Expectation for oil demand remain upbeat.
2044 2018-09-11 19:55:24 After just collecting 12 lakh crores from oil taxes in 4 years.
UPA collected 4 lakh crores in 5 years. 
And aapa, don't forget the crude prices...
2045 2018-09-11 19:55:04 17 years of lies and deception from the US government... it was an inside job and they murdered innocent civilians all so they could go to war with Afghanistan and take their oil.. RIP to all the ones who got stuck in the middle of their greed
2046 2018-09-11 19:55:03 Doesn't this period coincide with north sea oil and cheaper petrol and increase in car ownership though? More likely to be more complex than just a privatisation v state owned argument
2047 2018-09-11 19:54:40 He still has a year left on his TB deal, so he's expected to fulfill that in an Advisory role. Plus, KH still has 2 left on his deal.
My guess, it's either health related, or he's going to be joining the Wings next year, if KH is fired/released/boiled-in-oil...

2050 2018-09-11 19:54:13 No, power cuts were a fact of life from as early as 1970 due to Miners industrial action. The oil shock caused inflation to become rampant leading Heath to try and cap prices and wages. The Unions continued their strike action which was why Heath declared a 3 day week!
2051 2018-09-11 19:54:13 I have a diffuser with coffee-scented essential oil in my office that people think either smells delightful, or like a musty old closet. 

Don’t take too many meetings in here.
2052 2018-09-11 19:54:05 Last time I was in a Renault 5 something went wrong and oil burst out of the dipstick tube, up out of the point vent and scared the living sh@t out of me as a passenger #probably10yearsplusago
2053 2018-09-11 19:53:58 I’m changing my oil today because I’m heteronormative apparently. Nah jk I just like having a fucking car.
2054 2018-09-11 19:53:54 I'd definitely oil her scalp twice a week or as desired for frizz free healthy sheen.
2055 2018-09-11 19:53:35 Sure, you are right about that; however, the US and some other big countries are also a big part of the problem, as they want to control Venezuelan oil reserves. It should belong to Venezuelan citizens, not to Madure regime, not to the US and some other big countries.

2060 2018-09-11 19:53:08 No one is to blame for the 911 other than the EU&the Democrats in The US.They R the ones who created the Carter-Stine monster(Khomeini)to make sure there R enough conflicts in the M.E to keep the ppl distracted from stealing their oil.just look at the UK economy pre&after 79 coup
2061 2018-09-11 19:53:04 Holy shitt every time I come in for an oil change I wait at least an hour & a half....No matter how early or how busy it is
2062 2018-09-11 19:52:40 I want to start making carrot oil, I've had this in mind since early this year and 15k would go a long way in  giving my small business the jump start it needs, thank you @dejokecarew
2063 2018-09-11 19:52:33 I need an oil change
2064 2018-09-11 19:52:25 And not just oil rigs, there must numerous other jobs where there is much more risk to life than that to an army personnel. Why aren’t they above society in your view? They are also doing their job AND they are also contributing to the nation.
2065 2018-09-11 19:52:22 17 years ago today on #September11th, America sacrificed 2,996 Americans to start an opium based war in Afghanistan while also pursuing oil and slaughtering  innocent people/children from multiple Middle Eastern countries.
2066 2018-09-11 19:51:56 Also you can’t fry with olive oil so my thoughts are what I thought lol y’all just sauté
2067 2018-09-11 19:51:51 The only thing I hate about my lotion is that it smells like a fucking tree I should have gotten a fragrance oil
2068 2018-09-11 19:51:41 Tomorrow also , there will be a hike in petrol/diesel prices ! Hike unlikely to stop for now as even today Oil prices have gone up and rupee nowhere near recovery !!
2069 2018-09-11 19:51:29 Ok so you don’t actually fry stuff lol real frying requires a lot of oil , so yeah trackers don’t fry

2075 2018-09-11 19:50:45 Or are those roads for the oil & gas industry, Murkowski. You can't FOOL the people any longer. We can see where your priorities are, help the rich get richer and the people of the U.S. poorer. I think you sold your soul!
2076 2018-09-11 19:50:29 As in, all what I've been reading since just sounds like stories I heard while in school
2077 2018-09-11 19:50:25 I just wanna know why you chose the name lil powder  this other shits irrelevant. Was big baby oil taken? 
2078 2018-09-11 19:50:20 I specifically mentioned oil rig because they are also in constant fear of death. The working conditions there are abysmal.
2079 2018-09-11 19:50:18 I need to do an oil change to my Corolla too. 

My jeeps too damned much. My 68 el camino needs even more. RIP my bank account

2080 2018-09-11 19:50:14 Dang after having Skáreh I wish my hips weren’t all fucked up. I seriously feel like a 80 year old woman getting out of bed in the mornings. CBD oil ain’t cutting it anymore. 
2081 2018-09-11 19:50:12 Water is not lipophilic and oil is not hydrophilic. The sit on top they don’t saturate the surface of each other they don’t wet each other. Get it?
2082 2018-09-11 19:50:08 Can we get a game with Marathon Oil?
2083 2018-09-11 19:49:59 Absolutely! Getting some samples soon 
2084 2018-09-11 19:49:56 There's something super rewarding when the little ones start requesting olive oil with salt and rosemary dipping sauce for their bread and pasta at home.  It quickly turns on itself when they start spreading olive oil everywhere and complaining about the exact seasoning mix.
2085 2018-09-11 19:49:51 Interesting! բրշտուկ is actually the word used in Farsi too, but it's made with powdered sugar and oil. This halva is made with butter and regular sugar. The variations are fascinating.
2086 2018-09-11 19:49:50 #NeverForget If you really want to honor those that lost their lives 17 years ago, ask your elected officials why we still haven’t called on Saudi Arabia, a backwards, theocratic terrorist-promoting nation, to be held accountable. Oh right, it's that sweet old oil $$
2087 2018-09-11 19:49:43 You ask a lot for a very tired lady burning the midnight oil to finish her talk on time XD What's an IF engine?
2088 2018-09-11 19:49:34 Not in syria no. You seem to be referring to gulf states who we installed post WW2 to protect oil supplies as arabs had voted for socialism
2089 2018-09-11 19:49:19 So why isn’t Saudi Arabia home to fundamentalist preaching jihad, on the list of countries sponsoring terrorist. Oh they got big oil  never mind

2093 2018-09-11 19:48:51 I just add it all together, I don't get that anal about the oil. If I dropped 10 grams of olive oil on the pan then that's what I consumed whether it all got used or not. 
2094 2018-09-11 19:48:39 Noooo mama lmao I've never tracked fried platanos  I would use your best estimation based on how much oil you add and how many servings it yields
2095 2018-09-11 19:48:14 And pedophillia is a crime and addiction. If he wants rehabilitation he can go get it on an oil rig or somewhere without fucking children.
2096 2018-09-11 19:48:14 I think arguing who is the biggest sponsor - Iran or Saudi Arabia - is not the point. Both are pouring money into it. Iran has more man power and more willing to run guns and know how to terror groups in and out of the Middle East. Oil is the compromiser.

2100 2018-09-11 19:47:59 I've never tracked anything that was fried, I'd just use a careful judgement. Ex: cook 1lb of chicken with a T of oil, makes 4 servings. I'd assume each serving of chicken has an added 3G fat

2131 2018-09-11 19:43:38 It’s tragic. The big tragedy is Bush allowed it to happen.

He refused inspectors. He sent chemical weapons to Syria. He was known to have used them before.

Why do you think Iraq was invaded? No oil was taken. A democracy was installed. A dictator was toppled.

They started to plan this in 2000 and drove up the price of crude oil to capitalize on this day!! Russia gained money and started to rebuild from the USSR collapse!!!
2172 2018-09-11 19:38:36 Not entirely true. Our shale output has almost doubled thanks to the pipeline. Crude oil dependency is spread throughout the Middle East. Not only from Saudis.

2175 2018-09-11 19:38:27 Anything which makes AB oil more expensive and difficult is a bonus.

2177 2018-09-11 19:38:16 IMO, the most important factor is in the timing of peak oil demand is battery cost decline which is pretty much a guess right now.  50% battery cost decline from today will make the EV sticker prices a no brainer for sure.

2182 2018-09-11 19:37:11 I sell organic black soap nd oil for hair/skin care very affordable.pls RT nd patronise thanks.
2183 2018-09-11 19:37:06 Wonder how macro trackers track their fats when they fry stuff. Y’all measure how much oil is missing from the pan after cooking?
2184 2018-09-11 19:37:03 Yes. Its an antiseptic and a bomb moisturizer. Coconut oil on everyythang
2185 2018-09-11 19:37:03 Tidal flooding linked to climate change has reduced the value of 820,000 homes on the Atlantic Coast by $14.1 billion. The oil & gas industry in Texas wants taxpayers to pay $12 billion for a seawall on the Gulf Coast to protect it from the climate change it helped to bring about

2190 2018-09-11 19:36:36 That's not correct. Many patients see a MD, get lousy advice or Rx doesn't work so either live with the problem or wander off into voodoo land to be either passive victims of snake oil merchants, or active participants in mystical BS
2191 2018-09-11 19:36:21 #Obamacare is a Republican plan aka as Romneycare. Republicans believe #SocialSecurity #Medicare #Medicaid are socialist programs but not subsidies to oil cos; tax cuts for the millionaire & billionaire donor class. Note: trickle down economics doesn’t work!
2192 2018-09-11 19:36:09 As much as our heads want to rationalize it, our hearts know it's true: 
the Liberals said they would betray us and they are
Trudeau said:
-Canada is going to be the first Post National state & 
-pipelined oil to Communist China will happen to loosen ties with USA, no matter what
2193 2018-09-11 19:36:06 The difference is clear !! One was given a failed stated to salvage, while the latter destroyed a 'working' state. All he needed to do was to "oil" the running machine
2194 2018-09-11 19:36:05 Today in the book Matilda: she put bleach in her dad's hair oil bottle and he accidentally dyed his hair dishwater grey. #cjmlearns #cjmrocks
2195 2018-09-11 19:35:54 ...can't...just go selling our oil....
2196 2018-09-11 19:35:47 And giving him lots of oil to get rich!
2197 2018-09-11 19:35:33 Seriously. The sooner the reliance on that part of the world for oil/petrol/etc ends, the better.
2198 2018-09-11 19:35:27 When you add the two Grand Daddies of them all [1] OIL! in the form of petroleum based chemical fertilizers and [2] The pharmaceutical industry, that MUST have cholesterol matter, for the sake of their biggest seller!

2203 2018-09-11 19:35:00 coconut oil
2204 2018-09-11 19:34:57 If the rumour is true with the oil magnate accepting the candidacy of the other party, then we finally have a billionaire who can actually pay his nomination fees.
2205 2018-09-11 19:34:54 #TonightWithJaneDutton Re Fuel Price Increase: FACT: 10 million barrels crude oil sold at $28 a barrel when going rate was $40 a barrel (& this was NOT surplus stock BUT our entire oil reserve). What consequences for Tina Joemat-Pettersson? ZERO!
2206 2018-09-11 19:34:49 How much foreign influence is there working to bolster oil mining in Canada? Far too much. What needs to be done? 

Maybe stop licking boots.

Canadians want energy independence, not foreign control of our resources. Refine it where you mine it.
2207 2018-09-11 19:34:44 Ha I have no idea how to do anything manly besides like hammer some shit and change a tire and oil, I’m like yoooo song writing isn’t really a skill that keeps me alive during crisis
2208 2018-09-11 19:34:30 Oh damn!  maybe try a detergent that works on oil or greased stains as lipstick is greasy x
2209 2018-09-11 19:34:27 Sorry, you can't cite that conspiracy theory to me.

Post war M. E. politics moved on well after FDR died and since the creation of Israel. Plus Venezuelan oil deposits weren't even heard of at that time.

2213 2018-09-11 19:34:18 But stop glorifying them as some selfless individuals who are above the society. I don’t see any reason why a soldier sacrifices more than a worker in an oil rig also contributing towards the nation with a much greater potential of “sacrifice”.
2214 2018-09-11 19:34:17 Just got some oil called lily of the valley

2216 2018-09-11 19:34:03 Feel a #coldsore coming on? Dab the spot with tea tree oil, nail polish remover or even vodka....these can prevent it from blossoming
2217 2018-09-11 19:33:59 @UKCycleChat anyone use or used @wendwaxworks on their chain instead of oil? What did you think in terms of practicality and longevity?
2218 2018-09-11 19:33:59 Bosnia was nothing to do with oil... Do your homework! It was humanitarian! As was Kosovo! They massacred their own...

2223 2018-09-11 19:33:23 yessss, when the rice is cooked correctly and the oil to stew ratio is  perfect???? paired with malta??? moeeee
2224 2018-09-11 19:33:22 Now. Lets ask a nutritionist about the nutrients in the two slice of onions and tomatoes on the oil-rice. Is it garnish? The pepper spice and the sardines, oil-fried-egg and oil-fried-sausage. Then we check that, with your spending if you have acquired a complete balanced diet.
2225 2018-09-11 19:33:22 Trying CBD Oil doesn't entitle one to post a bunch of Snoop Dogg gifs, right?  Asking for a friend.
2226 2018-09-11 19:33:04 it is! i nuked a bag then cover it in sesame oil, ginger, garlic and fried it on high. at the end i added soy sauce and cooked it a little more :3
2227 2018-09-11 19:33:04 If this is true, can he swim the waters of Lagos politics? 
If asked, I will say he should stick to oil...

Well, in all of these I do not see the interest of the masses though. 

2019, Lagos is the stage!
2228 2018-09-11 19:33:02 I work as a land surveyor for an oil and gas company. Trump has more support here than one would expect but then again Alberta tends to be right of centre on average

2232 2018-09-11 19:32:23 None of this would be necessary if you looked after your gas / solid fuel / oil and LPG appliances in the first place. Serviced annually and used properly, these appliances don't generally cause problems. Having a carbon monoxide alarm is no substitute for proper servicing.
2233 2018-09-11 19:32:21 I really hate the smell of tea tree oil :(

2236 2018-09-11 19:31:52 I just bought a cool new GoPro Camera!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2237 2018-09-11 19:31:52 I thought Alberta received from RoC until later in the 1970's, that national policy was set up to subsidize the oil industry in Alberta. Prior to late 1940's there is no way Alberta was subsidizing anyone - it was the other way around. 
But....convenient to forget.
2238 2018-09-11 19:31:41 Youre right. You were a pawn. And brave i admit. But the mission was to defend oil companies interests and caused this refugee crisis.
2239 2018-09-11 19:31:14 Femi is one of the oil mafia that has been creating havoc in the oil sector including artificial scarcity, a beneficiary of PDP corruption.

2252 2018-09-11 19:29:50 Yep, it is immature as it highlights the fact that previous Govt created oil bonds to lower the price of petrol and diesel for short term gain of popularity and never thought of how it will be handled and how the country will be impacted by the oil bonds.
2253 2018-09-11 19:29:49 That's an oil panting gravity 3D kind of painting
2254 2018-09-11 19:29:36 Yes thats largely correct. The oil shock meant a 3 day week due to power cuts. That led to wage reductions and then strike action.

2268 2018-09-11 19:28:05 Buhari is not building any refinery nor ranches! 

The refinery in the north is a private development which will draw oil from Niger republic, its a partnership with Niger! 

The ranches if at all going on anywhere, it's a business venture dt must av undergone feasibility study!

2274 2018-09-11 19:27:30 I've also worked at a consumer goods plant in Quality Control and in a whole plant they need between 2 to 4 QC officers and the job is repetitive af. For example in a cooking oil plant you just check the shelf life of a product. Melting point,  spectrophotometry, etc
2275 2018-09-11 19:27:18 This is what happens when you have too much oil on the scalp and can let your brain breathe.  Well,...that and probably cocaine.

2279 2018-09-11 19:26:44 @Quora the purest form of crude oil byproduct, petrol cost ₹84/l. Where as last byproduct, heavy oil or 4t oil cost ₹400/l...?
2280 2018-09-11 19:26:41 They have an absurd amount of oil. 

That's why the House of Saud was installed. To protect that oil for US/French/UK consumption.
2281 2018-09-11 19:26:36 James happily enjoys his food. "They also mostly use oil instead of things with lactose."

2286 2018-09-11 19:25:58 I hope so. My doctor told me that CBD oil is ok to take and it won’t interact with any other medication I’m on but it’s the THC I need. That’s what’s meant to help with cancer. I know that using a tincture helped ease the side effects of chemo...
2287 2018-09-11 19:25:44 At the Guildford meeting? Not as far as I know. The Woking MP was at the second one and tried to oil his way through the evening.
2288 2018-09-11 19:25:36 Percentage increase should be correlate with crude oil percentage difference. Read and understand the basics of bar chart preparation before posting into social media. Not you. Ask your political party to do the same.

2302 2018-09-11 19:23:59 They used a lot of butter instead of olive oil.
2303 2018-09-11 19:23:53 Hopefully no serious flooding while you’re here. 

Are you in oil & gas? Manufacturing?
2304 2018-09-11 19:23:51 This dog even kissed the ring of the Saudi Arabian king at the time. This man is a RINO, a globalist tool, in bed with Islamists for their oil interests, never for Americans. Even Iraq war with "WMD" was a farce, killed so many Americans in M.E. I'm a Republican & hate this man!

2314 2018-09-11 19:22:31 モくん…創造理念(王の息子だから王位を継ぐ)と現実(王の息子と認めてもらえなかったので王位も継げない)のギャップがやばいです…
「父」を求めなかったとしてもはぼ「王」の側面しか見せてくれなかっただろうけども、「父」としての彼を求めてしまったばかりに「王」100%になった気配はしますね…
2315 2018-09-11 19:22:25 It could be the oil talking
2316 2018-09-11 19:22:17 As a token of appreciation for those agents that blew up the buildings to start gulf oil wars and invasion on Iraq and Afghanistan!?
2317 2018-09-11 19:22:07 Where do you start, the fortification...iron filings and calcium that is chalk. Palm oil  I would not feed them to my dog. Simples
2318 2018-09-11 19:21:59 I realize we have to have oil. So anti-oil isn't realistic. But Expansion and transport of the dirtiest oil on earth is over the top.
2319 2018-09-11 19:21:52 Everyone & they grandma pissing me the fuck off today. I'm just miserable af. & hot at it. So its adding oil to fire
2320 2018-09-11 19:21:49 YES! It doesn't taste like cooking oil.
2321 2018-09-11 19:21:48 I can't get the song "Oil Spill" out of my head
2322 2018-09-11 19:21:45 Oil is the lifeline to the country. They want to send a message that they can hurt the decision-makers as well as the infrastructure that sits far away from them.
2323 2018-09-11 19:21:40 Oil magnet, Femi Otedola, contesting Lagos State gubernatorial election in 2019 under the auspices of @OfficialPDPNig? These are interesting times in Lagos' politics. It's definitely not going to be a Tea Party for @AkinwunmiAmbode & @OfficialAPCNg. Let the hostilities begin!
2324 2018-09-11 19:21:31 It was an excuse along with the claim of WOMD that validated their intent to go into Iraq. Hussein probably said you want to impose sanctions against my country? No oil for the US!
2325 2018-09-11 19:21:30 Profit over People. Big Oil has more access to our lands then we do. They do not care what happens as long as their pockets fill up.
2326 2018-09-11 19:21:28 Your tinder tranny is leaking oil
2327 2018-09-11 19:21:27 I have dibs on tea boy, I make a great cuppa
2328 2018-09-11 19:21:15 Obas Oil 
2329 2018-09-11 19:20:55 No it’s just funny you think a google definition proves a point, water can’t be saturated by oil when it can’t diffuse through the body of liquid
2330 2018-09-11 19:20:45 If you roll out bread dough on flour, oil or anything, you *WILL* change the consistency of the finished bread. I wish people would learn how to make bread properly #gbbo

2332 2018-09-11 19:20:19 I'm confused now. Does this mean they (Oil&Gas) are on our side. Going up against #BTiS Murdo, Adam and Roothie, to name but 3 of them must bring smiles to #Scotland's #YES groups.
After @ProfTomkins crazy outburst in #ScotParly
2333 2018-09-11 19:19:57 Business group cant do something in oil price in world mkt so they shud shut up if they really want to help ask meralco to lower elextricity
2334 2018-09-11 19:19:53 Try a light body oil instead, keeps you smooth and fresh
2335 2018-09-11 19:19:51 oh nice, I like Dr Bronner's but since his kids took it over it seems like they've been weakening their soap, idk abt their coconut oil.
Have you notice Mrs Bragg's is not as dark as it used to be, either? It's just as pale as other brands :/
2336 2018-09-11 19:19:32 And I have another 30 items I can list,eg auto loan bubble,student loan bubble,housing/apartment price bubble globally,USD reserve status collapse due to Gold standard in Russia/China,oil peaking,AI,Robots and automation replacing 50% of all admin jobs,Blockchain replaces banks
2337 2018-09-11 19:19:32 ((Yay for adulting! I've managed to schedule all the appointments! 1 for my dog at the vet, 2nd to get my cars oil changed, and 3rd to get money exchanged for my trip! I'm on a roll!

2339 2018-09-11 19:19:22 I got two fleas off my dog to test if coconut oil really kills them. One’s dead, the other one’s taking a bit longer & has now found his mate. I can just hear it saying “Gary, you all right Gary? Oh god Gary, nooooooooo!”  #dogs #fleas
2340 2018-09-11 19:19:14 Oh that's easy I got more oil than I know what to do with. Enjoy the shrimp girls
2341 2018-09-11 19:19:13 A former Texas (read: oil) Governor going to talk about energy in Moscow (an oil revenue dependant government), out of sight of the US press. 
I wonder just how high they'll agree to price fix on a barrel?
2342 2018-09-11 19:19:12 None of that’s true Eddy. Venezuela under chavez started the downward spiral. Chavez seized the oil companies assets and redistributed their money to the people. The people loved it, at first and backed Chavez. Then the well started to dry up. Nobody wanted to do business there.
2343 2018-09-11 19:19:04 Also the Pentagon wasn’t hit by a plane at all but they claim it was. Yet there was no debris of the plane the supposedly hit the Pentagon. The government killed its own people for money and oil and the nation hasn’t got a clue.

2346 2018-09-11 19:18:58 70ies and 80ies? We were in Afghanistan? Not really. Russians were there but not us. Also first Iraq war, we were there to protect Kuwait( I mean oil fields of Kuwait) and went in and left without looking back. And all the attackers in 9/11 were Saudis. Not Iraqis with a gripe.
2347 2018-09-11 19:18:55 Except US buys oil from Canada, Saudi, and more not Iran.
2348 2018-09-11 19:18:54 You are a great man sir. Soon shariah is everywhere and Canada will be a much better place.
2349 2018-09-11 19:18:43 dopo lo scandalo Oil for food, l’ONU dovrebbe stare più attenta nelle sue esternazioni, giusto per evitare nuove figuracce.

2351 2018-09-11 19:18:35 Very fair. Correction noted :)
2352 2018-09-11 19:18:32 Protein treatment at weekly - Palmers protein pack from Clicks is good. Moisturize using loc method daily. Get a spritz with conditioner, oil & water for during the day when it feels dry. And get the purple shampoo and conditioner called pro-voke from clicks
2353 2018-09-11 19:18:30 Engine  oil and pizza
2354 2018-09-11 19:18:27 What about India begging US for an Iran oil waiver and the region is itself courting Imran Khan and also getting aware how India is increasingly becoming synonymous with Hindu Fascists and Muslim slayers.
2355 2018-09-11 19:18:19 Veganbottle no oil inside  #bottle #compostable;)
2356 2018-09-11 19:18:15 The car needed a oil change.. plus she always tells me in the last minute I thought she meant 2 o clock
2357 2018-09-11 19:18:13 You’re basing this on all the trains leaving Alberta to the United States, not the ones that are following the pipeline route. 
There’s no reason for trains to come to Burnaby. We aren’t and haven’t been loading oil tankers and we still only have one refinery here.
#fakenews
2358 2018-09-11 19:18:07 Okay after the 3rd person noticing my skin glow up, I must now promote KORRES WILD ROSE BRIGHTENING OIL 
2359 2018-09-11 19:18:00 We need to find another distraction for these oil billionaires, cus it’s looking like politics is their focus now.
2360 2018-09-11 19:17:54 How are they so completely bamboozled by that snake oil salesman?
2361 2018-09-11 19:17:52 That is a lot of jobs..i honestly didnt realise that many.
That is brilliant....I could relocate and become Stephen's PA 
2362 2018-09-11 19:17:37 There's more oil in Robbie's head then there is in the garage #FairCity
2363 2018-09-11 19:17:35 Social Media has a monopoly on their services! We found that to be illegal & dangerous ! They busted up the oil companies to prevent them from taking advantage of the public! As much as I don't like Gov intervention they MUST not be allowed to CONTROL us through their product!!
2364 2018-09-11 19:17:33 @Fritolay quick question! What type of oil are your pork rinds fried in??? 

Thanks!
2365 2018-09-11 19:17:31 Yes. Beside Jiffy Lube. He may have been getting his ride an oil change.
2366 2018-09-11 19:17:30 serioisly tho, oil +$2 and tech is killing it. good thing I don’t need markets to follow a certain script
2367 2018-09-11 19:17:25 I'm not worried because I only care about visiting places I can drive to. 

Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to take a big sip of coffee and look at this map of oil refinery locations...
2368 2018-09-11 19:17:24 Happy days. Brand new car has broken down 30 miles from home. Low oil pressure. Geniusso that's 3 cars fucked now
2369 2018-09-11 19:17:07 You ever want to nudge a coworker into a vat of boiling oil? No? Just asking for a friend.
2370 2018-09-11 19:17:04 By the way the best coconut oil in the world is tropical traditions gold label. Look it up look at their website it will blow your mind it’s all I buy.
2371 2018-09-11 19:16:58 (P.S. Iodine regulates the thyroid and will clear radiation from the body. Also look up Rick Simpson oil).
2372 2018-09-11 19:16:53 Yes! I bought maps for the same price as my normal internet purchases & found an amazing local stationers who saved me money!! #IndieHour #shoplocalseptember
2373 2018-09-11 19:16:47 You might be right,here’s a list of the black swans in the system now.200 Billion usd tariffs on China goods to USA.Bonds/Derivatives bubble at Deutsche Bank,Shale oil /has 300 billion usd loan default,North Korea/USA war,Brexit,EU collapse due to debt and rising rates,Populism,
2374 2018-09-11 19:16:44 Put some warm olive oil or lavender is even better if you have it on a cotton ball and just leave it in your ear for a while- it should soften some of the build up and release the pressure. X
2375 2018-09-11 19:16:38 Omg!?!! Seriously?  I. I have all of the above. I take activated charcoal with coconut oil every single night. LOL that is crazy. I never met anyone that knows the exact same things I find a priority
2376 2018-09-11 19:16:28 Eso le pasa por ser 1 pésimo ator, q no encuentra el personaje 1 oligarca con tutu (como nadie hizo algún chiste con oli/garca/ snif snif , o garca oil para su vehículo bueno no importa) pasa data de esos vinos de spencer( tintos me imagino )1 vino tinto dl peña blanco o rose no!
2377 2018-09-11 19:16:26 Never forget that 9/11 was paid for with oil.  Sorta like the GOP...
2378 2018-09-11 19:16:25 I like Whole Foods mayo, it doesn’t have soybean oil. I don’t even want to know what that says about me.

2380 2018-09-11 19:16:19 North Dakota farmers have to live with noisy, air-polluting methane burners on land where the oil companies have tapped underground. They were once used to quiet blue sky & gold wheat fields, now they are forever hearing noisy, obnoxious devices going 24/7 next to their homes-SAD
2381 2018-09-11 19:16:11 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.
2382 2018-09-11 19:16:11 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
2383 2018-09-11 19:16:08 めちゃくちゃわかりがあります  最初から最後までアーサーはモ〜に「王」としての側面しか示さなかったということですし、幼少期のモ〜はきっと「父」としてのアーサーを求めていたのかな〜と思うと永遠の断絶！で楽しくなりますね
2384 2018-09-11 19:16:07 Sometimes I slide around in olive oil and pretend I’m a slug
2385 2018-09-11 19:15:58 I have an increasing conviction Oil is about to have a major upside surge.  Implications for other assets.  Offshore drillers are stupid cheap here.
2386 2018-09-11 19:15:49 We must encourage Electric Cars and discourage our dependence on oil. Forward is the only way ...
2387 2018-09-11 19:15:46 Sorry baby oil
2388 2018-09-11 19:15:45 What am I doing wrong with my vehicles fuck ... everything’s perfectly fine then BOOM oil sprays everywhere  *shoots shoe at jeep*

2395 2018-09-11 19:15:07 It's a great deal.  I just wish there was a premium package that came with JM's patented hemp infused, sandalwood citron oil medicinal rub that could have protected or immediately fixed Fournette's hammy.
2396 2018-09-11 19:15:04 Its necessary to slice them apart.(Google) Like happened with Standart Oil in the past.
2397 2018-09-11 19:15:00 「王」とか「貴族」って基本血縁や縁組みで後継者を決めるので、「完璧な王」がいたとしたら、「完璧な王の、息子」も完璧でないといけないんですよね………
2398 2018-09-11 19:15:00 When they were in Central government earlier, UPA had asked the Oil companies to bear a small percentage of the loss (when barrel was more than 110 USD) and issued Oil bonds to compensate the losses.
2399 2018-09-11 19:14:56 What I am saying is remove all of the benefits from oil and gas from anyone that doesnt believe in O&G development. Right now too many people take it for granted. BC sends NG through pipelines in AB to US markets the hypocrisy is nauseating.
2400 2018-09-11 19:14:53 The Wars in the Middle East were for Israeli interests, not stupid oil or the petrodollar.
2401 2018-09-11 19:14:49 Oil is why you all been fighting all these years and destroying ancient lands.  How do you think this will all turn out?  It’s hard to imagine.
2402 2018-09-11 19:14:45 Yes we do. We have the Beautiful Earth anti stretch mark oil
2403 2018-09-11 19:14:42 Remarkable story from @reid_indeed telling the story of his father on the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster, and the importance of Health and Safety in chemistry and why he cares about it. #ChemicalStories
2404 2018-09-11 19:14:36 The report says oil bonds and cash assistance! No where, it mentions exact bond amount!
2405 2018-09-11 19:14:29 I've been tweeting this as replies to all the crack pots today. Right in their face!
2406 2018-09-11 19:14:22 Yep. Coal, gasoline, oil.

2410 2018-09-11 19:14:07 All it means is they're not gaining passive EXP gain. You can buy food with oil.

2412 2018-09-11 19:14:06 very very much this, Michael. meat should ideally be aftermarket of dairy and eggs as a transition plus boutique production and hunting. As a bonus, if we do this plus stop burning oil and keep using it for fertilizer, the world goes less hungry.

2417 2018-09-11 19:13:35 Good one James...he has retweeted it 
Shall have a read of it in a minute. Looks an interesting article.
2418 2018-09-11 19:13:34 you want a link to a university degree in economics? Sorry. But feel free to research trickle down vs stimulus. Feel free to look up exploding warehouses in texas with no regulation. BP oil spill? any of them.
2419 2018-09-11 19:13:27 Which jobs of the past did come back? And for how much longer do you think coal or oil jobs will be viable? While the US is beating the dead horse of a dying economy, the restl of the world is steaming ahead creating jobs im sectors viable for the future
2420 2018-09-11 19:13:26 Y’all are idiots. 9/11 was an inside job staged by the government to start a war for oil that would continue for almost 10 years. There is so much evidence and unexplained details that point to the event not being foreign terrorism. The biggest government coverups in history.
2421 2018-09-11 19:13:25 this has to be a jokethis is like water and oil, they don't match at ALL
2422 2018-09-11 19:13:24 you know you’re old when you mix your organic pain relief balm with your organic coconut oil to put on for the day.
2423 2018-09-11 19:13:17 Amarjeet go to Wapasu a working camp for the Oil Sands and see the greeting you get. I would stick to a place where you don’t want to hear the truth! So for you that’s not many options.
2424 2018-09-11 19:13:01 Dear @dysartpetersham 

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
2425 2018-09-11 19:12:44 Here's an insane statistic from the @TheEconomist: By 2030, #SaudiArabia will use more energy to run air-conditioners than it now exports as oil. 
#ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateAction
2426 2018-09-11 19:12:43 The biggest sin Arabs ever did was settle on land that was full of oil.

2429 2018-09-11 19:12:31 Not here in Florida, we have our own oil
2430 2018-09-11 19:12:27 Thanks for the advice. I have some oil painting experience from college. It's hard to find the book for less than $150 online so I'll check the book stores on my next trip to the continental US. I live in Alaska so there are plenty of beautiful landscapes to paint.
2431 2018-09-11 19:12:18 #ASAUK2018 @ENNOsuteye Great sessions on oil & gas, mining re: sustainable human development. Interrogating issues of migration, local content, continuities and geopolitics.
2432 2018-09-11 19:12:12 911 attacks allowed: Patriot act - surveillance state to control the U.S, got people willing to go fight the energy rich countries in the Middle East, allowed for multi-billion dollar oil and natural gas line projects to proceed - as there are now. One of them goes through syria!
2433 2018-09-11 19:12:08 Using 9/11, just like using Trump, as a means to do nothing other than pad your pocketbook. That is all you have become, a snake oil "journalist" riding whatever train you can to profitville.
2434 2018-09-11 19:11:48 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2435 2018-09-11 19:11:42 Saudi Arabia is too critical to the supply of oil around the world to tell the whole story.
2436 2018-09-11 19:11:29 If #FlorenceNC blows my roof off, I'm replacing it with a solar roof because fuck the oil and gas industry for doing us like this.

2438 2018-09-11 19:10:57 "The Chinese will take over your ports to compensate they loans & interests". 

Well.

The colonisers still have a grip on tourism, oil, alcohol & cigarettes, telecommunications, horticulture, EPZ, and advertising industries in Kenya, and I don't know what loans we repaying!

2439 2018-09-11 19:10:55 Greetings all, do you think the oil price will jump to $85. I believe it will hit this price soon it could be this month. This could impact so many things.
2440 2018-09-11 19:10:53 That's the point. Let's use that oil to build an industry in Alberta! What if canada's largest solar plant was based on okotoks? Why not? Especially if the carbon tax money was used to subsidize it, it's next gen and not a finite resource. It WILL run out.
2441 2018-09-11 19:10:43 Is FoxNews/GOP aware of some secret plan to leave this Planet once all the natural resources are exhausted?  Sure seems that way from the rolling back of emissions regulations, to the willingness to double down on coal/oil, to removing protections on various endangered species.
2442 2018-09-11 19:10:39 Gaddaffi & Hussein were friends of the West until oil intervened - the proposed petrodollar replacement ?
The West (U.S particularly ) stirs these wars - you are paying a hefty mortgage I'm guessing  & have sold your soul to sell war
2443 2018-09-11 19:10:27 2/2  A top boss told me to ‘blow it up’ so spent weeks driving it around in first at max revs from cold having drained half the oil out. Eds sold it to the ads dept. A few weeks later it blew the motor & the hole was big enough to fit your head in #thingsishouldhavebeensackedfor
2444 2018-09-11 19:10:25 He talked about their achievements, I remembered Israa Gool and the ads which greeted Bassil for discovering the oil. Who knows maybe more, but I wasn't aware, for they are multi

2448 2018-09-11 19:10:11 Hang on. What ever happened to the oil bringing about a £10 billion surplus? Sure I saw that on here just the other day.
2449 2018-09-11 19:10:09 Still digesting the implications from reading Stuffocation plus working at the local auction house today so familiar with what happens to ‘stuff’ when people get fed up with their collections ! #reuse #recycle
2450 2018-09-11 19:10:08 I use the whole plant cannabis oil CBD product "Phoenix Tears" by the company "nu." Organic and made in Oregon. I take CBD after every full contact sparring session. It makes my head and core feel much better after taking a lot of hits.
2451 2018-09-11 19:10:07 If you say that about him, then the same applies to every leader that’s untested. 
Do you think there could ever be a Premier of Alberta that is anti oil??

2456 2018-09-11 19:09:52 Oh noooo. Oil changes are super important because the engine will seize up if it’s too lowstill I put it off...
2457 2018-09-11 19:09:50 ADVICE/HELP NEEDED

Has anyone got any information or first hand experience of using CBD oil to compliment traditional cancer treatments please... It’s not for me personally but need to educate myself for a friend & family member

2459 2018-09-11 19:09:24 Obama cites numbers and makes general claims, but never says exactly what actions he took. Natural resiliency, general overall strength and Fed policy account for all of it.
Obama did nothing. It's a fact
2460 2018-09-11 19:09:24 Bless your heart.  I suggest you replenish your lamp oil lest you be left out when the bridegroom comes.
2461 2018-09-11 19:09:19 these 2 people at the oil change place just set off alarms because they were messing around with the massage chairs and started busting out laughing. They’re probably.....17/18. Really 
2462 2018-09-11 19:09:13 I mean I know Dr. Oz is a fucking snake oil peddler, but why in the fuck is he having a spot about the Ramsey murder on his show? 

For that matter, it's never going to be solved, I don't get the continued fascination with it 20 odd years later.
2463 2018-09-11 19:09:13 DMV and oil changed all done within 30 minutes including driving time. #WINNING
2464 2018-09-11 19:09:05 Well you know, not buying any more Saudi oil might let them know we wont forget.

2467 2018-09-11 19:08:24 Yet, you bank on Bernie Sanders and his snake oil promising young voter turnout.

2469 2018-09-11 19:07:52 Yet here we are. Relying on oil, same as always, except with a bigger deficit than ever.
2470 2018-09-11 19:07:39 But there is no subsidy. Who are you people? Who are they paying the subsidy to? Has any oil marketer told you they are owed subsidy? Haha!
2471 2018-09-11 19:07:33 Thank you, I know that.
But I'm not asking about the shareholders, I'm asking about the flow of income, year by year.

Ford produces cars, Exxon sells oil, Apple sells its AppleiCrap, and from those products they get Money.

but Twitter?
2472 2018-09-11 19:07:32 Oil in braids are amazing.  A lifesaver
2473 2018-09-11 19:07:24 Yep I was there with a 17.5% mortgage. She decimated manufacturing and sold off everything she could, had all the money from oil and still wrecked the country with everyone for themselves mantra, but I suppose that’s a rubbish argument as well.
2474 2018-09-11 19:07:15 Actually, if you’re boiling pasta in a small pot with little water, a little oil disrupts the surface tension and prevents it from boiling over. It does nothing else however *dabs*
2475 2018-09-11 19:07:03 and those walls are difficult to bring down as they were erected by big oil and the politicians and/or bureaucrats that big oil owns
2476 2018-09-11 19:06:45 I’ve noticed that before legalization here in Cali most cannabis oil sold medically listed very high THC levels, 80’s were common even 90 and above was seen. Now I’m hard pressed to find a cartridge with THC in the  70”s. What gives? Was it a big lie when oil  listed higher THC?
2477 2018-09-11 19:06:45 @Citizentvkenya, Hussein ask Hon Moses why the govt is exporting oil when we have shortage in Kenya
2478 2018-09-11 19:06:41 It should help with the excessive oil

2482 2018-09-11 19:06:22 Take long hot showers, drink lots of hot tea with honey, take vitamin c and zink pills
Eat lots of spicy food, like spicy ramen or spicy picked vegetables
Oh and definitely try inhaling the steam of eucalyptus oil!!
2483 2018-09-11 19:06:11 I'm for energy independence, against money in politics, for domestic energy production, against fracking, for clean air & water, against wars for oil, for socialism, against child labor, for America, against global warming.
2484 2018-09-11 19:06:10 @HusseinMohamedg @citizentvkenya  Kenya's continued indebtness to CHINA is  sure a national insecurity threat .We are just about to lose our sovereignty  freedom and properties to the Chinese gvt.Our oil Port and Roads will be under control of CHINA #Newsnight

2486 2018-09-11 19:05:56 Is more than a juicy job bs of insurgency, FG& Intl organizations pump a lot of money to that state
politicians prayers are always let the insurgency continue bs is as competitive as oil&gas states in Niger Delta.
Those men will never want insurgency to end bs they're benefiting

2490 2018-09-11 19:05:30 Did Abacha sign a 25yrs Oil Deal with CHINA as alleged ?
2491 2018-09-11 19:05:29 It is meaningless as it compare 5 food companies with 3 oil companies and shows just 1 oil company produces as much ghg as 5 food companies and the top 3 oil companies produce nearly 3X the ghg of 5 food companies. it shows the best way to reduce ghg is to target oil companies.
2492 2018-09-11 19:05:27 Oil consumer?
2493 2018-09-11 19:05:20 Tuesday Tax Tidbit – @txcomptroller recently announced final FY 2018 revenues, showing state collections up compared to FY 2017: #Oil & #gas production #tax revenue $4.82B, up 56.1%; sales tax revenue up 10.5% to $31.94B; all funds revenue up 8.1% to $120.2B. #txlege #budget
2494 2018-09-11 19:05:18 Because those people dont understand just exactly how Canada benefits from the sale of oil and gas infrastucture yet other projects like site C dam and muskrat falls dam which had opposition to them and localized benefits get pushed through. The country is broken.
2495 2018-09-11 19:05:16 I read that as peak oil/Michael Rapaport stuff and cant stop laughing
2496 2018-09-11 19:04:56 damn, thank you. olive oil sounds like the truth! def gonna try it

2499 2018-09-11 19:04:50 There's no oil shortage,  stop the propaganda
2500 2018-09-11 19:04:45 Mark my words, If Justin gets another 4yrs he will announce the cancellation of the expansion due to the decline in oil production due to his own regulations.
2501 2018-09-11 19:04:37 I would argue that the 1970s oil price rises changed the world more than either.   
   
After the 1973 war between the Arab nations and Israel, the OPEC countries doubled oil prices, then doubled them again. The shock led to a global recession from which the West never recovered.
2502 2018-09-11 19:04:32 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2503 2018-09-11 19:04:25 Never saw it but I was into the peak oil/Michael Ruppert stuff for a while, until I came upon his claim that the Echelon sigint network was an AI that helped plan 9/11 in order to manipulate the stock market.
2504 2018-09-11 19:04:19 I'm going to start drawing again, it's been years since ice created something but i miss it, it was my therapy....im gonna get a sketchbook and some oil pasties and see what I can create 
2505 2018-09-11 19:04:16 Remember - these articles are written by reporters in every state - not just where oil $ is - and the same verbiage is coming out of college newspapers - has been for 20 years.
2506 2018-09-11 19:04:16 I thought that your anxiety would subside a little bit being in California. Sounds like it isn't. I've told you to look into using that CBD oil it's great for anxiety. While your dad is out there maybe he can get you some.

2521 2018-09-11 19:02:21 But really, you have to look at the Bush family, the historic role of the House of Saud, the influence of money & oil on politics. The connection of CIA to the Mujahadeen, the connection of heroin Afghanistan.

2523 2018-09-11 19:02:12 They were the first arguably though Turkey was in there too with its innumerable oil trucks sold by ISIS. So many nations have an interest in permanently weakening Syria to the vast detriment of the long-suffering Syrians.

2552 2018-09-11 18:59:52 You’re basing this on all the trains leaving Alberta to the United States, not the ones that are following the pipeline route. 
There’s no reason for trains to come to Burnaby. We aren’t and haven’t been loading oil tankers and we still only have one refinery here.

2575 2018-09-11 18:56:49 If I can’t shampoo, condition, change my oil, fill my wiper fluid, fry fish and wash my body with it, I don’t want it
2576 2018-09-11 18:56:44 @sujavarunee is clearly pointing out why when #Mumtaz can eat sambar/gravy made w/other oil, she needs olive oil only fr her dosas, tht oil is getting cooked as well?
Mumtz Jalra Aarthi is comng up w/more excuses. Did she foret she got kicked out even bfr Julie for her attitude?
2577 2018-09-11 18:56:32 Anybody with ramps/ oil pan want to help me flush and change my transmission?
2578 2018-09-11 18:56:29 Is it me, or does he seem to have an extra quart of oil in his hair today?
2579 2018-09-11 18:56:26 Home made coconut oil is my go to  and I feel really uncomfortable with make up especially eye shadow
2580 2018-09-11 18:56:10 Respect and admiration for you Leo but can you tell me how we win, which are the solutions and how we will convince all these greedy billionaires and multinationals who controls governments to stop burning oil, putting gases out in the atmosphere, destroying forests, etc, etc...
2581 2018-09-11 18:55:58 Oil in boiling pasta water is a way to prevent boiling over.
2582 2018-09-11 18:55:50 Uh-oh this just mean Murica must be running out of sources of free oil.
2583 2018-09-11 18:55:43 If you all can take a moment to recall the fuel subsidy scandal involving Otedola ( Forte oil, Lister oil etc ) They had to set the rep committe chairman Faroq Lawan with about $200k bribe to implicate him and get away at some point. The rest is history now.
2584 2018-09-11 18:55:42 The ones at valvoline always do it to me. They said, " you want the oil you got last time?" Me: "yeah I guess" charged me $90 for a damn oil change & I paid $40 the time b4

2587 2018-09-11 18:55:30 I suspect the codliver oil is not for eating. 
Otherwise, he might have the best dish today. #GBM
2588 2018-09-11 18:55:24 Got the engine oil cooler assembled and installed.

2590 2018-09-11 18:55:20 I get it and kind of understand the whole process. It's because people don't do their own research, so they have to "bubble wrap" the indusrty so no one buys into the snake oil.
2591 2018-09-11 18:55:12 U.S. oil benchmark prices rally to highest finish in a week
2592 2018-09-11 18:55:12 I loved my old smokey 525TDS. Torquey, comfy and reliable for the 25k I had it for. Finally developed an oil leak at 186,000 miles. Still managed to get back two thirds of what I paid for it 2 years before. They don’t make them like that anymore.

2596 2018-09-11 18:54:31 I hear you, we just do our best to get through it. I always say nothing bad lasts forever, there's always light n hope. Maybe you cld try cbd oil? I haven't not legal here
2597 2018-09-11 18:54:19 Time to fill up with fuel tonight. Oil prices are up due to hurricane fear.
2598 2018-09-11 18:54:08 Not wrong all them clubs have to buy and sell to make ends meet Man City can buy 30 players without having to sell anything and although I’m Arsenal you would of dreamed to be like spurs now without the oil money  would be in dream land
2599 2018-09-11 18:53:59 Because we get their friggin oil. We make political bedfellows with a country that continues to do a genocide in Yemen attacking and killing children but Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq are still enemies but not the country where most people responsible with 9/11 are from.
2600 2018-09-11 18:53:40 I love those
2601 2018-09-11 18:53:34 I can't imagine
 
Is it condensed okro(with pepper,fish,meat and oil in it) or okro with stew..
2602 2018-09-11 18:53:29 A large oil tanker..... all other transport has been used as weapon 
Ships are only one left.... access to oil tankers is easy for them.
2603 2018-09-11 18:53:22 One thing I do when I want to cook chicken in the oven and haven't had time to marinate it, I spice it enough add cooking oil to the mix, spin the mixture in the microwave a minute or on the pot for those who don't use microwaves. Then it's good to go! #food #cooking
2604 2018-09-11 18:53:17 Sigh - the jobs are a complete fabrication. Kinder Morgan in it's submission to the NEB only ever claimed 2300 construction jobs and 90 permanent jobs. The oil industry is laying off thousands because of automation. Construction camps also mean huge spikes in sexualized crimes
2605 2018-09-11 18:53:03 I was at work when it happened, and my wife rang to tell me the news. She worked on a US owned Oil Refinery and it went into lock down for the next 18 hours until it was deemed safe. She lost a work colleague who she was emailing reports to. We have never been back to NY since
2606 2018-09-11 18:52:58 Took a chance and ordered some cheap beard oil from Amazon. It's called Kentucky 51. Stay away. It's ultra thin and practically evaporates when you rub your palms together. You have to use 10x more than normal.
2607 2018-09-11 18:52:56 Get some clove oil... Rub on area of pain works very well
2608 2018-09-11 18:52:55 CBD oil has massive benefits in many areas.
2609 2018-09-11 18:52:46 Nasty beasts  Does mom have any peppermint oil? That takes the pain away for my humum.
2610 2018-09-11 18:52:40 Lycopene is not soluble in water.
Which is why all tomato/olive oil based sauces stain and are a bugger to clean.
You're welcome.
2611 2018-09-11 18:52:29 Looking for beard balm/oil suggestions that doesn't smell like patchouli/dirty festival sex.

Thanks!
2612 2018-09-11 18:52:24 Airlines strong w oil up interesting. Like $UAL and $LUV but no current positions
2613 2018-09-11 18:52:14 Just bought some toilet paper infused with coconut oil. Is this how you self care?
2614 2018-09-11 18:52:06 every single real asset has its own specific undiversifiable interest rate. oil has an interest rate. gold has an interest rate. Btc does. usd does. when you get synthetic exposure to these assets,even if u hedge eth price risk to usd YOU STILL HAVE ETH INTEREST RATE RISK

2619 2018-09-11 18:51:41 Need an oil change for my car. Which one of you hs mechanics who would talk shit bout my stock car can do it??
2620 2018-09-11 18:51:41 Correct  .. now he realised why congress kept on increasing oil prices to collect tax.

2625 2018-09-11 18:51:11 I don't recall the left giving a damn when leftist environmental groups took money from Russia to block fracking and oil exploration and coal in America....
2626 2018-09-11 18:51:06 @citizentvkenya @KBonimtetezi @HonMoses_Kuria there needs to be cap on oil prices with vat eg at Kshs130 per litre so as to cushion increase in oil prices in the future
2627 2018-09-11 18:51:06 Lapis body oil and uncertainty smoothie. Dimensions are shifting.
2628 2018-09-11 18:51:03 Let’s remember 9/11 also as the official start of the witchhunt & prosecution of innocent Muslims all around the world. all human lives matter. God have mercy on those  who’s lives were shattered because of a imaginary terrorist hunt. oil & gold should not b reasons 4 massacres #
2629 2018-09-11 18:50:44 I believe that the majority of the gains in the US economy are substantially direct result of shale oil production started a decade ago and it's spin offs not as a result of gov policies.  I would be very interested in a segment exploring that idea

2633 2018-09-11 18:50:22 Need to get an oil change
2634 2018-09-11 18:50:21 Topical CBD oil has been a god send for me.
2635 2018-09-11 18:50:05 In the 70's the leftists told us we were running out of oil. That was proven false so then they said we were heading into an ice age. False again. Then they said warming which morphed into climate change which covers all the bases. It's all a money and power grab.
2636 2018-09-11 18:49:55 Home made CBD oil Liz... boosts the immune system to super highest.  Can't hurt.
2637 2018-09-11 18:49:51 oil change got my tires put on and got a haircut I’m bout to eat and the rest of the day bout to be a wrap
2638 2018-09-11 18:49:49 I mix a little castor oil in my facial wash and it makes my skin so soft I love it

Yea, pretty wild, yet that seems to be what happened
2645 2018-09-11 18:48:48 Today that I actually tell myself I won't check twitter at work is the day twitter served up a whole lot of drama.

2648 2018-09-11 18:48:43 Great....apparently peppermint oil/spray around the window sill will keep them away!
2649 2018-09-11 18:48:42 OMG a Liberal, someone who has no sense of a taxpayer's dollar, asking another politician to resign.  The hypocrisy.  I think the Alberta Government should use the Notwithstanding Clause to overturn eastern bias on the oil industry and the TM pipeline.  I lost my job last week.
2650 2018-09-11 18:48:19 The Alberta NDP have given other oil producing countries $billions by implementing a carbon tax and creating uncertainty in the oil industry.
2651 2018-09-11 18:48:16 ああああああああぁぁぁ！！！！！！！！！！！
2652 2018-09-11 18:48:15 If IMF and worldbank walks away from us. Sh will depreciate as the US will be stronger meaning that. Pay more for oil. We will end paying more for fuel
2653 2018-09-11 18:48:14 have you ever tried a face wash with tea tree oil? the Body Shop one saved my skin. it’s definitely drying but I just use a good moisturizer after!

2662 2018-09-11 18:46:51 Hyperbole - that's what it really is. 

Food inflation is down so it doesn't hurt th common man in the near term. 

Being a market watcher I was afraid prices of Crude Oil would rise from the lows of US$ 35/. 

I was elated when FM Pranab Mukherjee gave freedom to OMCs to...

2663 2018-09-11 18:46:37 Did he fall into a vat of oil? He looks slimier than usual.
2664 2018-09-11 18:46:28 No other president has refused to release their tax returns. No other President refused interviews with networks besides FOX, no other president has lied as much as you, no other president has allocated so much public land for lease to oil, gas, and coal...
2665 2018-09-11 18:46:19 750ml, apparently.

For us, olive oil is a default, getting used all the time; while fish sauce takes intention, and we don't use it as often as we might. I don't think we really use olive oil too fast, but we could be applying fish sauce more widely.
2666 2018-09-11 18:46:15 Good question, my guess is Petro dollar has something to do with it...they accept USD for oil payment from other countries, we sell SA weapons.
2667 2018-09-11 18:46:07 No you just want oil
2668 2018-09-11 18:45:52 It would be like putting a Greenpeace activist on an oil sands advisory panel. What could go wrong?
2669 2018-09-11 18:45:45 Read up on electricity and electricity surges and the fuel used for cooling those surges.  When the electricity went out on the twin towers the electrical surges spiked radically in the surrounding buildings - resulting in fire and oil igniting that fire.
2670 2018-09-11 18:45:42 I trained in South Africa as a firefighter, similar training as in the US and Canada. I went on to work for international oil companies. 

SA firefighters are the best trained in Africa.

Problem in SA isn’t training, it’s working for those dysfunctional municipal Fire Brigades.
2671 2018-09-11 18:45:40 I would say Texas, just for farming and oil, but it is too big and spread out. Certainly large pockets though (Austin)
2672 2018-09-11 18:45:22 These lamps create everyday ambiance and provide reliable lighting during times of emergency.   kit $14.99  oil $12.99
2673 2018-09-11 18:45:07 I seriously hate getting an oil change so much that I offered my bf lunch on me if they takes it for me... he said no. I seriously thought free food would get him.
2674 2018-09-11 18:45:06 Well atleast the aliens wont convince us to invade another planet for oil... maybe 
2675 2018-09-11 18:45:02 Holy crap, what a bunch of bullshit. I can’t tell if you’re gaslighting or simply ignorant. 

The water pollution in Flint was caused by the oil industry led by the Koch family. 

Do some research and “educate yourself”.
2676 2018-09-11 18:44:48 RUB decline didn’t work out so well for oil in 2h14
2677 2018-09-11 18:44:47 Farouq Lawan Vs Otedola oil subsidy scam saga just came to mind.

What do I know
2678 2018-09-11 18:44:26 Fashion idea: pita pants with pita pockets filled with hummus, taziki sauce, taboulli salad, and olive oil.
2679 2018-09-11 18:44:22 You're an American This is enough because you listen to media talk about freedoms and the government is killing to save 10 cents on a barrel of oil
2680 2018-09-11 18:44:21 Arif. The Brits sided with the subcontinent mslms v/s Hindus. Mslms piggybacked while Hindus/Sikhs fought for India's independence. Later Brits molly cuddled M-E for oil & sold thm weapons & stakes in Retail & Cos. This was thr undoing. Now petro$$ are thr masters.
2681 2018-09-11 18:44:18 Has Ted even been to the oil patch? Has Ted even been to Texas?
2682 2018-09-11 18:44:09 Why are you more worried about America than Canada and Canadians?

If you want to benefit Canadians, fight to nationalize our energy industry and refine oil in Canada for our own use. Energy independence please!
2683 2018-09-11 18:43:42 Tea tree oil >
2684 2018-09-11 18:43:30 Cauliflower and carrots mixed with broccoli. Then you sauté with garlic in olive oil and that’s the best thing EVER
2685 2018-09-11 18:43:30 #UKOG LSE tag team derampers are spooked by the huge oil storage tank that arrived on site today. Spooked by the BKP Oil Tanker that left today . Spooked by the RNS re Broadford Bridge today. What a great price to buy at now imo.

2687 2018-09-11 18:43:21 Pure and natural essential oil blends to center your mind, support your body, elevate your mood, and clean your home. High-quality, great price... Mother E
2688 2018-09-11 18:42:48 They were never going to sell Canadians discounted oil.

They aren't refining it here where it's mined. "Too expensive"

"Canada not worth it"

Stop trying to fool us. We're not stupid!
2689 2018-09-11 18:42:43 They aren’t protecting anything else than the US’s interest in oil in the middle east
2690 2018-09-11 18:42:38 Nothing is more scary than putting one leg in the shower & realizing @ChantalBaker1 decided to use a whole bottle of conditioner, 4oz of coconut oil, probably some car grease, more than likely baby oil, and not let anyone know.. she’s out to get me. #SkatingIsntTillDec
2691 2018-09-11 18:42:18 I love oil painting omfg

2693 2018-09-11 18:42:05 Wonder if @Spalders has some pics of that? I'm intrigued how bit works.. Oil fed centrifugal type thing?
2694 2018-09-11 18:42:01 @birtymotogp Sorry to mention something else but Malaysia’s national oil company is correctly pronounced Pet-ro-nas; not Petro-nas. It’s a shortened version of Petroliam Nasional, hence Pet-ro-nas. Ask Syahrin if you need confirmation. #bahasamalaysia #Malaysia 
2695 2018-09-11 18:41:47 I have oil paints and a couple of extra canvas!!!
2696 2018-09-11 18:41:44 Crude oil price spiking on International Markets. Fuel price increase on the cards for October with more to come later in the year. 
2697 2018-09-11 18:41:40 나도.... 잘자 51님
2698 2018-09-11 18:41:35 Its a propaganda, please research articles of 2012-2014 for reason why oil bills were pending. Those articles r on TOI website only. 
Those were bills of Iran which could not be paid due to US/UN embargo.
2699 2018-09-11 18:41:34 Ok but i did that and i had a cracked oil pan and didn’t know and they would have caught it if I’d taken it in. Instead i put it off, drove with it and leaked all the oil and the car died 
2700 2018-09-11 18:41:33 (Also from the size, it's probably not a guy! Female oil beetles are larger.)
2701 2018-09-11 18:41:18 And since then gas PRICES have been rising. So you and your big oil friends think taken more money from the 99% is find while you and 1% get richer.  Great job.
2702 2018-09-11 18:41:17 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2703 2018-09-11 18:41:17 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2704 2018-09-11 18:41:03 What happened to the oil industry????
2705 2018-09-11 18:41:00 Yeah but i need a oil change
2706 2018-09-11 18:40:36 That’s like me putting off an oil change because taking it in and dealing with a bunch of men stresses me out haha

2710 2018-09-11 18:40:18 BAMN is the slogan of leftists, however, no assumption should be made that gives this subversive mole cover. Whoever it is should be rooted out along with the mentioned  co-conspirators wherever they are.

2712 2018-09-11 18:40:06 Um, that's a coil steel car. It carries steel rolls. The car on the far left is a tank car, but is currently empty as evidenced by the absence of a DOT placard. Lots of crude oil and refined products (incl ethanol) are transported by rail, but this isn't it.
2713 2018-09-11 18:40:05 follow the oil
2714 2018-09-11 18:40:04 you broke an oil rig by not using enough lube? Did they make you pay for it, or was the exile to Hull your punishment?

2720 2018-09-11 18:39:30 Nigerian Govt should consider using AI in oil exploration, it’ll save millions and aid geo scientists.
2721 2018-09-11 18:39:12 Sinister #palmoil company @Indofood exploits workers. I want @RSPOtweets to kick the rogue company - and @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner - off its certification scheme & stop supporting exploitation palm oil now! #workersrights

2725 2018-09-11 18:38:44 Never forget that 17 years ago the government killed all those people for a little oil and cash.

2726 2018-09-11 18:38:36 I’m still skeptical about who & why. Given your analysis of Semion’s reach & the coincident rise of the Tea Party, it makes me wonder if destabilization of the Middle East is not only the obvious political plot but a long game to make Russian oil the only tap left in EurAsia.
2727 2018-09-11 18:38:25 Easy answer is the fact that trump has many economic deals with  Saudi Arabia and personal economic development with Saudi Arabia his own son in law Jared Kushner gave classified information to the Saudi crown prince and the oil the oil is a another major factor
2728 2018-09-11 18:38:23 plantain is soooo much sweeter when fried with an air fryer than with oil omdsssss
2729 2018-09-11 18:38:18 Other measures  includes signing contracts for 55 oil and gas exploration areas on September 24  . Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.

2732 2018-09-11 18:37:42 The product of oil companies is taxed.  They don't get "corporate welfare".  They pay a surtax passed in to the public as all taxes are.

But also never forget the 100,000's inocents killed in Iraq by illegal bombing & invasion by Bush/Blair & the subsequent unrest & displacements fuelling the Syria conflict
Well done US & UK for using murder to justify slaughter to protect oil interests
2736 2018-09-11 18:37:18 BB1 oviya's request for green tea and banana just once  ignored but BB2 mumtaz request olive oil, buffalo milk, supplements in d name of medicine granted weekly. Speak about fair play!

US, Europe, Russia, China, India may reduce oil consumption and find alternative fuel.
2739 2018-09-11 18:36:56 I still need to go home & get an oil change 
2740 2018-09-11 18:36:56 Really good thing that the screen next to true crime Jonbenet Ramsey had a story entitled “the coconut oil conspiracy” playing on it
2741 2018-09-11 18:36:48 If we have a port in Iran, it would be easy for us to trade. About the petrol price, with a big oil bond return hovering over you, it is not easy to reduce the price. But with better compliance, we may be able to see a reduction.
2742 2018-09-11 18:36:48 maybe i could try switching out my joints for cbd oil .

2745 2018-09-11 18:36:21 I wash my body from head to toe with exfoliating gloves – I put coconut oil on my eyelashes.. like don’t waste my time chile
2746 2018-09-11 18:35:55 Got the oil changed in the Forester today, then ran a few small errands that I've been needing to do. I actually found what I was looking for in the store, and even got home and unloaded the car before it started raining. So far it has been a good day.

2751 2018-09-11 18:35:42 Pouring oil on disjointed people is not annointing. Annointing comes from brethren dwelling together in unity.

2754 2018-09-11 18:35:20 Hopefully this coconut oil does my hair some good 
2755 2018-09-11 18:35:18 What crude oil bro? Petrol comes from Mitrogen from gutter just like the mentality of most Bhakts.
2756 2018-09-11 18:35:06 If I was famous & had a list of "demands" for my dressing room, it would be: buckets of movie theater popcorn (but only the yellow buttery salty pieces), white zinfandel (multiple family size bottles), and one million blankets (that have been sprayed with lavender essential oil)
2757 2018-09-11 18:35:03 Don't want, I just started shaving my chest and using coconut oil on it so the glare stops people from looking at the stream.  Space Invaders is also celebrating 40 years this year.  I see a 40 oz 40 year challenge coming on.

2761 2018-09-11 18:34:36 A booming us economy doesn’t help Russia, US opening up oil and gas sectors doesn’t help Russia it hurts them. Toughest sanctions on Russia came from Trump, while also not lightening up 2014 soft hit sanctions. Expelled diplomats doesn’t help Russia. God You’re dumb.

2770 2018-09-11 18:33:29 Is Halfords insane? £60 for a 5L bottle of engine oil, or £40 for the same thing on Amazon.
2771 2018-09-11 18:33:24 That was before Dangote started expanding into the oil sector.... 

Tell me truly, when Dangote's refinery is completed, do you think the profit  forte oil amd other importers rakes will remain the same?
2772 2018-09-11 18:33:21 EOPS is being undertaken under the guise of getting an international market for the Turkana oil and also infrastructural development before the development and actual production stages commence.

2781 2018-09-11 18:32:42 In the grand scheme of things, #Petrotrin produces 6% of the country's hydrocarbon ( oil and nat gas) production. The biggest actor in T&T is #BPTT who produces 53% of our hydrocarbons. Trinidad and Toabgo produces 9 times more natural gas than oil on an equivalency basis.
2782 2018-09-11 18:32:21 @Publix when and why did you get rid of olive oil as a topping for subs and replace it with canola oil?

2791 2018-09-11 18:31:18 They may well have their fingers in many pies, but my point is their short game means they always back the loser....

2803 2018-09-11 18:30:38 Has Trudeau blown it? If NAFTA fails and tariffs are put on autos, Canada is  in a very bad place. The oil industry has been destroyed, autos next, higher taxes, corporations bailing, wealth leaving and taking their money with them and huge deficits to pay off.The next Venezuela

Without going "But but but ... Crude oil" 
2806 2018-09-11 18:30:32 Not all oil is the same and bitumen is not explosive like the shale oil in Lac Megantic. So how about you deal with those facts instead of exploiting a horrendous tragedy under false pretenses?

2815 2018-09-11 18:29:45 I love layering jojoba oil on top of a lotion or moisturizer. Lotion is the Seaweed Bath Co peppermint body cream! Cheap, all natural ingredients, smells like mint chip ice cream, and is soooo hydrating. Smelling and feeling like a whole snack.
2816 2018-09-11 18:29:45 The EOPS is just another jubilee photo op. Just hogwash and hot air. If the oil is not economically viable then there's no need of wasting tax payer's money on this EOPS. Where are they taking the oil?! What will be the returns?
2817 2018-09-11 18:29:41 We’re not talking about shutting down the oil industry. We’re just dealing with obstacles to the expansion of bitumen mining. I’m pretty sure that we can figure out how to develop our economy without that resource.

2821 2018-09-11 18:28:58 African governments are bound by negotiated contracts for independence. Why do you think that it is so hard for African oil producers to refine their own oil? There is a lot that the layman never knows
2822 2018-09-11 18:28:55 That is not at all true. Iraq once had the premier medical schools in the world based off a nationalize oil system after they revolted again the monarchy. It was liberal and democratic. Western influences just got mad they lost their cut.

There’s no match for garlic, coriander and butter or ghee on Naan.
2829 2018-09-11 18:28:08 It is the modern snake oil treatment. There is no way anything can cure all the ailments that they claim. I tried it for a couple months and it did nothing. But psychosomatic results are real, if you believe then maybe..
2830 2018-09-11 18:28:05 Eating at restaurants is a bad idea if you're concerned about nutrition. Variance in portion sizes, cooking temps, ingredients; doping ingredients (e.g., cutting olive oil with canola oil), etc
2831 2018-09-11 18:28:00 Ahh in my book that's oil but that works too hahaha
2832 2018-09-11 18:27:43 I would say it's WAY past time for OIL to stand on it's own. Does it really still need federal subsidies? I think NOT!
2833 2018-09-11 18:27:38 Of course, the state of Texas doesn’t have #oilandgas methane standards.

This rollback leaves Texans almost entirely unprotected from #climate and #publichealth impacts from #oil & #natgas production’s air pollution.
2834 2018-09-11 18:27:24 Do we need to check our oil too or???
2835 2018-09-11 18:27:22 How about petitioning all our MP s telling them again about the importance of this oil discovery to the country  ,reduce  imports .etc,etc
2836 2018-09-11 18:27:22 I constantly get sinus headaches that turn into migraines. The combo ive found to work is excedrin migraine as soon as i feel a twinge and a roller ball on my temples of 200mg CBD oil. If that doesnt help i take prescription imatrex.

2844 2018-09-11 18:26:46 Price of oil and the recoverable amount blows previous estimations into space . IMO
2845 2018-09-11 18:26:45 He’s not hard to find. 
2846 2018-09-11 18:26:41 The Early Oil Pilot Scheme is a whole nother thing altogether. Alot of skepticism being that its not actually a profit making venture to the Government.

2848 2018-09-11 18:25:51 I ... see.
Hm.
Well I found one (an applesauce muffin) that DOES use veg oil but you can easily substitute butter--I know you're not crazy about that, but it's fine to do.
2849 2018-09-11 18:25:39 Remember that time our own government bombed its two biggest buildings and blamed it on two little planes so it could start a war for oil #NeverForget
2850 2018-09-11 18:25:36 At the tire shop at 8am this morning wishing I could patch my own tires and do an oil change. I would love to go to a mechanics class. Learning something new & useful is fun. 
2851 2018-09-11 18:25:36 I certainly don't see a sense of urgency from Trudeau in getting this pipeline back on track. I think Notley should force his hand by dropping the carbon tax altogether or cutting off the oil to Vancouver.
2852 2018-09-11 18:25:26 And yet they are not a part of the travel ban.  why is the United States of America beholden to Saudi Arabia. Is it the Socialists, is it oil, is it globalism/corporatism, bribery, what the hell is it.

Seriously @charliekirk11 wgat is it, name the enemy... please...
2853 2018-09-11 18:25:26 @realDonaldTrump Russia, China, Turkey, Syria, will soon invade the middle east, with Iran already there, And invading Israel. They are preparing for war to get rid of Israel control the whole middle east and the oil!
2854 2018-09-11 18:25:21 It's really a sign of how far we've come and how few real problems we have that the ACLU has to look for something to litigate.

2856 2018-09-11 18:25:11 He doesn’t understand what he writes yet claims to know about the existence of God and can insult you if you disagree with him. He doesn’t stand a chance when faced with a religious snake oil salesman.

2858 2018-09-11 18:25:04 Almost 3000 people died on September 11, 2001 so America could bring death and destruction to the Middle East.  The military industrial complex, big oil, and bankers are wealthier while the entire world has become destabilized.  And the MSM still believes Bin Laden caused this.

2864 2018-09-11 18:24:31 Isn't horses the stack? Isn't oil the stack? He seems to be arguing that "org structure" is the cause and I am saying "org structure" is the consequence of the stack - your current products. Org structure is not the cause.
2865 2018-09-11 18:24:26 After i grabbed my oil na
2866 2018-09-11 18:24:25 Contradict yourself much? Your prior paragraph says how it’s all our problem, not just the US. Your second statement disparages the Paris accords which was not just us. So, what, if we don’t immediately all stop using oil, why do anything?
2867 2018-09-11 18:24:20 Johnson baby oil tho
2868 2018-09-11 18:24:13 So what economies of scale is there in trying to fill a 400,000 barrel capacity tanker using trucks?!
2869 2018-09-11 18:24:04 nothing war for oil and gold would still continue
2870 2018-09-11 18:23:55 I’m not gone lie... I catch myself saying “earl” instead of oil sometimes...but my grandmother and dad saying “dr. Appurntment” and “turlet” is just taking it too far.
2871 2018-09-11 18:23:54 How about petitioning all our MP s telling them again about the importance of this oil discovery to the country  ,reduce  imports .etc,etc

2873 2018-09-11 18:23:39 June 2004 Petrol was Rs 35.71 and till April 2014 it went to Rs 71.41 and also the burden of oil bonds. Now atleast we do not have that burden.

2883 2018-09-11 18:22:23 I’ll never look at Johnson and Johnson’s baby oil the same EVER again. Scarred for life.  #Traumatized
2884 2018-09-11 18:22:01 The importance of the small details in good customer service...

My wife just got her car's oil changed. When she got into the car afterward she found a hand written thank you note & a mint. 

It takes minimal effort but makes the world of a difference.
2885 2018-09-11 18:21:58 Or maybe price pressure was building for other reasons? BoAML project that a 1M bpd shortage in global oil output is good for $17/bbl price increase - just don't see the US reduction being of scale that other producers can't meet. Mystery to me.

2886 2018-09-11 18:21:55 Pence oil bankruptcy cost taxpayers 150 million. Pence oil co pollution on 200 sites they abandoned, w/1/4 cleaned cost taxpayers 18 mil with 3/3 more to clean. Pence family kept their millions w/taxpayers paying tab.

2888 2018-09-11 18:21:47 That’s ok, they’ve been doing it time immemorial but when Gadaffi said from today we shall sell our oil in return for gold, they killed him. Also Iddi Amin did it in Uganda too but it didn’t prevent the value of the money from falling #mbyogede

2892 2018-09-11 18:21:10 It’s just this one professor. Ion know if its cause he old or cause i don’t care for this clsss but we like oil an water. 
2893 2018-09-11 18:21:04 It's so well positioned. #JKX reducing costs across the board, increasing production towards 10k boepd, divesting unprofitable assets into increasing oil and gas profile. At £50m market cap the scope here is immense imho. (remember what their valution was several years back!)
2894 2018-09-11 18:21:04 Everyone needs to lose the pain pills and grab some cbd oil, something i am missing since moving from the west coast back home to the east
2895 2018-09-11 18:20:28 In this house we drink straight canola oil no chaser
2896 2018-09-11 18:20:22 After I leave here I’m getting this oil changed and going through the car wash and I’m done spending money on this car for a while
2897 2018-09-11 18:20:08 Then they should put their money where their mouth is and refuse equalization payments as they primarily come from the revenue generated from the oil sector.
2898 2018-09-11 18:20:00 No more blood for oil - never forget 9/11
2899 2018-09-11 18:19:57 Chiarelli has done more trashing to the oil than anyone ever can. But yet staples is fully on-board. What a joke
2900 2018-09-11 18:19:55 I am a chronic pain sufferer from severe nerve damage and spastic muscles that is as great risk of addiction to opiates... and cannabis is the only thing that helps, in the form of CBD oil and plant. It has helped me continue to function.

2902 2018-09-11 18:19:45 I am an oil and gas person and so is my dad. Most of the top managerial positions have Indians.

2904 2018-09-11 18:19:21 We can all help Zoe by choosing wisely when buying to make sure to avoid palm oil products
2905 2018-09-11 18:19:21 But are all of these incremental rail cars destined for the west coast to be shipped by tanker? I have not seen the data for any increase in oil tanker shipments out of the Burrard Inlet. This oil is finding more markets that TMX would not it seems.
2906 2018-09-11 18:19:20 #UKOG It makes sense to support a UK company in view of the cost of fuel oil/ gas for the ordinary family is set to soar over the winter, with many going hungry to keep warm #ukgov #weald  wake up !!!

2907 2018-09-11 18:19:20 Femi Otedola as a billionaire with serious interest in Oil&Gas may eventually denies accepting PDP offer coz if Baba Buhari wins n he wins in Lagos. He knows they can "disrupts" his business. This is Naija, anything is possible!

2913 2018-09-11 18:18:37 Not really. Lots of stuff moving. Tech. Oil.
2914 2018-09-11 18:18:36 I wonder whether or not Otedola's governorship declaration is not unconnected to Dangote's refinery to be completed in  2019.
Who knows whether Otedola wants to wrangle or even completely kill the refinery in order to continue the dominated of these oil barons on the sector?
2915 2018-09-11 18:18:28 Remember that time when 20 terrorists from Saudi Arabia crashed planes into US buildings so we went and invaded Afghanistan and then Iraq because of natural gas and oil reserves and then that NFL player was like Yippie Ki Yay but Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan? #NeverForget911
2916 2018-09-11 18:18:24 How disrespectful.. look at what President Trump has accomplished.  4.2% GDP. Lower taxes. they are nearly self sufficient in oil production.  Trudy 1.8% GDP, massive jobs loss, huge debt.  No pipelines.  Alberta is dying as are many other Provinces. Goes on and on.
2917 2018-09-11 18:18:15 the fossil-fuel companies also traffic heavily in snake oil...

2930 2018-09-11 18:16:59 Not fracking - it’s saltwater disposal wells where saltwater from oil production is reinjected back into the earth. Many Oklahoma wells have a high ratio of water to oil, so they need lots of disposal wells.

2932 2018-09-11 18:16:18 Jeapord? A false flag to attack Iraq for oil. Afghanistan for poppies. And later attack on Lybia for to change the currency standard on which it sell its oil from USD to gold

2938 2018-09-11 18:15:41 i need an oil change lmao
2939 2018-09-11 18:15:41 No economies of scale in setting up a new refinery owing to the comsiderably small quantities of oil that would be refined. Remember Tullow plans to do phased production of oil (60,000) to around 120,000 barrels.
2940 2018-09-11 18:15:38 Have you asked about CBD oil yet? Xx it certainly makes you hungry xx

#oil #OOTT
2948 2018-09-11 18:14:29 Haha. The brits shouldn't have come in the first place. In fact the bloody Bantu anscestors shouldn't even have left  Cameroon highlands sijui my anscestors walitanga tanga wakitafuta nini. We were probably of Royal blood owning swathes of land on oil reserves you know 
2949 2018-09-11 18:14:20 Depends. What is your "reasonable definition" of socialist? Socialism is the government ownership of the means of production of wealth—the farms, fishing boats, and factories. Other than owning the oil, did the gov't own the factories or the fishing boats or the farms?

2954 2018-09-11 18:13:45 have spent my whole life enjoying canned tuna but only in the last year did I discover the stuff packed in olive oil. Truly delicious. Sunflower oil is good too, but too caloric. Tastes incredible however.
2955 2018-09-11 18:13:41 The CARFAX is screwed up. That should be April but the good ol state of Illinois didn’t issue my title till then and I got an oil change a week later. I’ve done 16k since May lol

2968 2018-09-11 18:12:09 9/11 began islamophobia war propaganda.

2997 2018-09-11 18:09:49 can't blame the women,   poverty having no help and have to feed the kids and family drive women to end up as prostitutes, is the same in Iran there is no help and support or budget to help from the government but is oil revenue available to be spent in the proxy war.

3000 2018-09-11 18:09:34 “CBD comes from the Cannabis sativa plant, which is also used to produce hemp and marijuana.

3001 2018-09-11 18:09:32 The inflation in many countries is above target. They are not brexiting. The trouble is you’re only looking within the prism of Brexit and not other factors such as rising oil prices. As for peak inflation, well it went up after the Brexit vote and has now dropped back...

3015 2018-09-11 18:07:35 Thanks! We've settled on showing a small number of oil based street lamps in the towns. The fact that Peterloo was on the cusp of so much social and technological change makes fact checking a high priority...

3025 2018-09-11 18:07:03 The U.S. is the world’s largest combined producer of gas and oil. The question is whether that happened during Trump’s presidency, which began Jan. 20, 2017.

The answer is no.
3026 2018-09-11 18:07:01 During Pastor Ada's time that people were really fasting and annointing their heads with oil recorded the most epic failure in my course.

3031 2018-09-11 18:06:00 I lost about 40lb, despite pressure testing the diet and increasing calories by around 500 kcal per day. Like, I was drinking olive oil out of the bottle on top of a calorie fixed diet, and I was still losing weight, haha.
3032 2018-09-11 18:05:59 EIA data shows that U.S. has been the world leader in gas production since 2009, oil production since 2013, and combined gas and oil production since 2011. All of this happened well before Trump came to White House.
3033 2018-09-11 18:05:58 Forgot chili oil. How could I!? Now am full lmao. They’ll be good leftovers tho
3034 2018-09-11 18:05:52 but in all seriousness. Two things really. One, I don't get a lot of heart burn, but I do have IBS so it evens out there, and secondly, I try to take peppermint oil extract every day. It really helps with the digestive tract
3035 2018-09-11 18:05:48 probably because you have oil and you don't.
But yes, the best wishes to the Venezuelan people.
3036 2018-09-11 18:05:44 Dunno! There just seems be a particular melt-point doesn’t there? Doesn’t seem that warm today but the coconut oil has melted, oh

3082 2018-09-11 18:01:25 Oil Prices rose as U.S. sanctions squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening global supply despite efforts by Washington to get other producers to increase output
3083 2018-09-11 18:01:13 Texas has an abundance of oil and gas, just weren’t able to get to it. The science of fracking came into play and TX was booming again.
3084 2018-09-11 18:01:03 Add the upa oil deficit (₹2.8L Cr).

Makes one wonder, what would have been the impact of upa's oil bond gift on nda's inflation rate?

Would have been a catastrophic start for any other government (developing country).
3085 2018-09-11 18:00:59 The problem is that you people just consider your family and your surroundings. The poor became much poorer while the corporate and oil dealers become humongously rich.

3110 2018-09-11 17:58:12 Bull! Texas oil isn’t booming! It’s stagnant and in decline! The boom has busted @tedcruz and your just lyin’ as usual. Only time @realDonaldTrump was right was when he named you Lyin’ Ted Cruz!
3111 2018-09-11 17:58:11 Can't blame upa for oil price, but how they managed the overall economy.

Just see the difference in inflation figures ... the most logical comparison of all.
3112 2018-09-11 17:58:04 This was obv coming. Oil and gas HATES this rule. Wonder if this may be opportunity for a future admin to do a better job than Obama EPA could because the monitoring tech is now so much better. This rule is a mod of LDAR for refineries. But the infrastructure is very different.

3114 2018-09-11 17:57:25 Peak oil skal ikke hellerforståes som noe absolutt. Det er noen parametere som ligger til grunn og de endres stadig.
3115 2018-09-11 17:57:07 Booming oil business =  higher prices at American gas pumps.

3116 2018-09-11 17:57:03 How I deal with soreness, aches, pains from an aggressive lifting schedule:

1. Improve my sleep quality
2. Make sure I'm my taking liquid fish oil and CBD oil consistently
3. Decrease my lifting volume per workout
4. Add a rest day
3117 2018-09-11 17:56:55 This guy at work made everyone take drops of oregano oil under their tongue. Oooooh never again.
3118 2018-09-11 17:56:55 Morning Blow only says what he is told to say by his handlers! The same people who own All the media, the drug companies, oil companies, banking system, etc, etc, are upset that Trump has taken their total control of America away from them! This is a battle for freedom...
3119 2018-09-11 17:56:44 It’s so Socialist that over 70% if its economy is privatized, the exploitation of the workers and the concentration of goods are in private hands, and the nation is driven into poverty by western sanctions targeting oil (lifeblood). 

But let me guess, it’s “not real capitalism”?
3120 2018-09-11 17:56:40 I put too much coconut oil in my hair this morning and oil has been running down my neck all day 
3121 2018-09-11 17:56:40 “By the fall of 1918, it was clear that a nation's prosperity, even its very survival, depended on securing a safe, abundant supply of cheap oil.”

3122 2018-09-11 17:56:36 Taught someone how to grow dagga and make Cbd oil tonight.

It's the little things that count.
3123 2018-09-11 17:56:33 Sorry to hear of Olivia Newton John's latest battle but "Good on her" for pushing for the potential availability of cannabis oil for cancer patients not to mention the countless other debilitating illnesses it can treat YOU GO BATTLE GIRL !
3124 2018-09-11 17:56:31 Bat ganon? inaantok talaga ako sa castor oil puñetaaaa
3125 2018-09-11 17:56:28 YOU DONT KNOW THAT AS A FACT. I WILL SUGGEST THEY USED OLIVE OIL INSTEAD OF LEMON SINCE ITS ITALY
3126 2018-09-11 17:56:27 India faced high oil bills but working constructively in other sources. Modi ji has done great jobs in electrifying poor villages, works on solar energy, a port in Iran being under india's control soon, ignoring USA for Iran oil, LPG, CNG pushes etc. Plz appreciate that too.
3127 2018-09-11 17:56:21 i never shut up i’m just so excited for rep indy it’s the first show i originally planned on first rep show i bought tickets for MONTHS AGO DURING PRESALE it’s my home show lucas oil is my baby boy and i’ve just been waiting so long for this day. going my peak on saturday
3128 2018-09-11 17:55:58 Started using raw/organic Coconut Oil on my face and I'm loving it. My face is less oily than usual.
3129 2018-09-11 17:55:57 This realization will always be a stain on the Bush Administration. Oil was put above our love of country and the thousands who died. This has always pissed me off to no end.
3130 2018-09-11 17:55:55 Sir please cut the oil prices...please.
3131 2018-09-11 17:55:47 i refresh them if they’re super frizzy after i sleep on them! invest in a good silk cap (something i need to do, my heads too big lol) but i spray them with water and put some leave in and some OGX coconut serum or cantu shine oil in it and diffuse a bit - takes like 5 mins!!
3132 2018-09-11 17:55:46 I got a massage and I’m literally covered in oil. I feel like a chicken ready for the oven.
3133 2018-09-11 17:55:44 I've been putting lavender oil on my pillow and take magnesium vitamins an hour before bed. I think it's been helping so far
3134 2018-09-11 17:55:39 Tea tree oil is truly a godsend. Acne doesn’t stand a chance.
3135 2018-09-11 17:55:34 @JeroenSwart brother wena nomlungu  hay u r water & oil u dn't  mix well.Good luck on trying 2 make him c dat his words r his enemy
3136 2018-09-11 17:55:21 Ummm no. Spent the last 6 years with people begging for jobs in the oil field, for the last year it’s completely turned around. More jobs than people
3137 2018-09-11 17:55:07 Then he bombed the fuck out of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and brought justice to the families of those killed by terrorists from those two nations.....er...ummm...... nope..... they are still "allies" and we leveled Iraq for Oil and Afghanistan for opium.. 
3138 2018-09-11 17:55:02 They are very popular though. 
And it is a political fight. Obviously for oil and gas resources. So let's not get into that.
3139 2018-09-11 17:55:02 One of my packages came yesterday but I was getting an oil change and of course dunce 1&2 didn't hear the door 
3140 2018-09-11 17:54:54 What a surprise...'Washington Examiner' owned by a Christian conservative billionaire who inherited his father's oil drilling company.
3141 2018-09-11 17:54:52 Venezuelan official TV : vice-president Rodriguez in China stroke deals with Chinese CNPC in oil area.. #oott
3142 2018-09-11 17:54:52 Methane, which is among the most powerful greenhouse gases, routinely leaks from oil and gas wells, and energy companies have long said that the rules requiring them to test for emissions were costly and burdensome.
3143 2018-09-11 17:54:41 I knew there had to be a motive for Olivier Newton John to come out saying she uses Cannibus oil, Her old man has a farm in the States. self promotion or what ?
3144 2018-09-11 17:54:40 Methane, which is among the most powerful greenhouse gases, routinely leaks from oil and gas wells, and energy companies have long said that the rules requiring them to test for emissions were costly and burdensome.
3145 2018-09-11 17:54:31 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
3146 2018-09-11 17:54:09 Anybody on here use CBD oil? Long hard days are really taking their toll on my already seriously damaged body.
3147 2018-09-11 17:54:08 Negative zero. Drill a hole no oil, drill a hole no oil, drill a hole no oil repeat for 24 years. You picking up what Ike putting down?
3148 2018-09-11 17:54:01 HDawareness Has any one used CBD oil will it help a person who suffers with Huntington’s Disease. ???
3149 2018-09-11 17:54:01 Plus the temperature that steel crumples at is much higher than that of the temp of burning aviation fuel, they did it for the excuse to invade Iraq for the oil
3150 2018-09-11 17:54:01 I did growing up as a kid. They leak all the time, but they are also the safest transport method. I assume we don't want oil production to stop, but renewables are the goal. Ideally we wouldn't need pipelines, right now we do. How would you like us to determine pipeline routes?
3151 2018-09-11 17:53:54 That’s was an inside job by G W Bush administration! Perfect pretext for invading Iraq and steal oil. Disgusting !
3152 2018-09-11 17:53:49 Sure it was. The article fails to mention why. This is nothing new. It's not about oil itself but how it is traded. Against the American dollar. Look what has happened to every oil producing countries leader that has wanted to push a different base to value it on.
3153 2018-09-11 17:53:44 I'm so close to downing some olive oil because this dry throat ain't it  I can't even sleep in peace.
3154 2018-09-11 17:53:42 jovie's oil puchangina
3155 2018-09-11 17:53:17 Ms. Sgamma praised the Trump administration for turning the oil companies’ requests into policy,  “It all depends on who you trust,” she said. “That [Obama] administration trusted environmentalists. This one trusts industry.”
3156 2018-09-11 17:53:02 And @INCIndia left behind unpaid oil bills worth Rs 2 lakh crore. Just as Rajiv Gandhi had a babalog's party and left behind unpaid bills for which India's gold had to be mortgaged. That is how Congress manages the economy.
3157 2018-09-11 17:52:56 10k will buy 1.5 (twenty five litre) gallon of groundnut oil. Profit about 3k+
3158 2018-09-11 17:52:53 In July 2008, 1 USD was at 43 INR and in Jan 2016, 1 USD was at 66 INR. Plus increase in refining and transportation cost, do u really think only crude oil price decidec overall prices. Who will calculate extra 23 rupees per USD. Don’t mislead with half facts

3160 2018-09-11 17:52:36 It's mostly genetics, tbh. I wash my face once a dat (at night) with soap and a washcloth and moisturize with whatever's around (olive oil, shea butter, lotion). I believe that rest, and no overcleansing your skin makes a huge difference, but each persoj is different.
3161 2018-09-11 17:52:27 @ProfOsinbajo Good evening sir, i am using this avenue to call your attention to the yearly fuel scarcity that i believe is always orchestrated by some selfish and greedy individuals in the oil and gas sector. This is September please sir don't be caught unawares.just instinct.
3162 2018-09-11 17:52:24 Truth. Honestly I'd love to see uniforms in all schools. Even's the playing ground and changes schools from fashion shows into learning environments.
3163 2018-09-11 17:52:20 NRA, pharmaceuticals, oil, military vendors, 1% era’ thosecontributions are bribes.
3164 2018-09-11 17:52:18 Oil Bonds are hedging instruments and Vajpayee Government had also done the same and subsequent MMS govt paid.. pls explain 100% increase on taxed on fuel price and price rise when crude prices fell .. hai koi jawab ?!? Except for some stupid graphics?!?
3165 2018-09-11 17:52:15 Maybe Canada needs supply management on oil.
3166 2018-09-11 17:52:06 This is the guy that in 2009, President Obama called him “the most popular politician on Earth.” Lula has been charged with corruption and money-laundering offenses in a multibillion-dollar graft scheme at state-run oil giant Petrobras.
3167 2018-09-11 17:51:51 The UK government have a woeful history of policy on North Sea oil and gas. Brexit will do nothing to improve matters. Another one of our struggling  global industries will be have to overcome more barriers. Bloody awful.
3168 2018-09-11 17:51:33 Can you put coconut oil on a new tattoo? Google is being fugazyyyyy right now
3169 2018-09-11 17:51:18 Hey Ted, go ask Oklahoma how tax cuts worked out for them. They have huge oil and gas money revenue but don’t tax it, and now schools can only afford to operate 4 days a week, among many other problems.

Your ideology is dangerous.
3170 2018-09-11 17:51:16 i use argon oil which helps but my hair naturally gets very oily too

3173 2018-09-11 17:50:56 Yes but unfortunately a War with the Saudis means no oil for America no oil means a total crash in our economy...we should change this Immediately become self reliant #MAGA

3176 2018-09-11 17:50:39 The Mesa County Commissioners appointed Quint Shear to the Mesa County Federal Mineral Lease District Board of Directors on Monday, September 10th.

3177 2018-09-11 17:50:33 - I got my oil changed then later that day, got a $10 off coupon in the mail. 
- Got shorts from J. Crew then later that day got a catalog of theirs in the mail. 
- Order came from Todd Snyder, then got a catalog in the mail the same day. 

How can I use this to my advantage?
3178 2018-09-11 17:50:32 Aise log bhi rehna hai bhai, not every time constructive debates work, for ex we can't cover centre on fuel prices if the opposite guy says bring down taxes on fuel which you have raised when crude oil price went down. Nalin kohli ji couldn't gave back when @ARanganathan72 spoke
3179 2018-09-11 17:50:29 Why b cis when u in the oil field ain't nothing baby bout that whooping crane life.
3180 2018-09-11 17:50:28 I think the dumb luck of sitting on a sea of oil had something to do with an oil boom.
3181 2018-09-11 17:50:17 All lanes are now open on the #M40 northbound in #Warwickshire, between J15 #A46 and J16 #A3400. Colleagues at @WarksFireRescue have dealt with a car fire, and we have also worked to clear a spillage of oil from the carriageway. Delays remain but are easing.
3182 2018-09-11 17:50:15 I feel like an oil ball can I leave class to take a bath is that ok
3183 2018-09-11 17:50:13 @mollieohorler just thought about baby oil paper clip and I can’t stop laughing. I’m walking down the road by myself :))))
3184 2018-09-11 17:50:05 Usual wind and pish about brexit on the BBC about skills shortages on oil and gas platforms shutting them down. The industry has no problem axing staff by the 000 in quick time so I'm sure they can recruit them as quick too #usualcrap

3186 2018-09-11 17:49:50 I swear I thinks it the truth! Also look at oil prices going up...it made it possible for Putin to balance his budget, I believe.
3187 2018-09-11 17:49:47 Don’t get it . Cbd oil completely legal . Why raid a shop selling a legal product unless for some other reason you disapprove ? And why would our government make it hard as possible to get it ? Answers on a postcode please
3188 2018-09-11 17:49:47 WOW, you just don't get it. 
Times up, you're over cooked in snake oil and venom.

3189 2018-09-11 17:49:46 But petrol price in the upa govt crude oil high and this time curd oil Price is low and petrol Price high

3192 2018-09-11 17:49:36 And heroes along the way, from journalist Ida Tarbell taking on Standard Oil to rise of NAACP and MLK, the proletarian and anti-fascist 30s movements, and more - worth knowing.
3193 2018-09-11 17:49:28 シャドウゥ「マジで焦った」
3194 2018-09-11 17:49:21 Obama said, with his typical distain for we commoners, we could not drill our way out of the oil shortage.  Private enterprise took the challenge and proved the ONE wrong.
3195 2018-09-11 17:49:21 If it was about oil the US would have developed Venezuela, which is much closer and easier to manipulate.

It's about stability in the M.E. and sale of arms.
3196 2018-09-11 17:49:18 All that oil money
3197 2018-09-11 17:49:18 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
3198 2018-09-11 17:49:14 #CarbonCapture is Proven. CO2 has been safely captured, transported, injected, and stored for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the U.S. since the early 1970s, while Norway has stored CO2 from North Sea natural gas production since 1996. #CCSTechFacts
3199 2018-09-11 17:49:10 TEXAS booming oil patch????????? Then why are prices of gas so high? And don't say it is investors causing it. IT IS GREED!
3200 2018-09-11 17:49:08 Can I pick an option? lol
I only hold 2 CSE stocks. So I will pick $pkg, don't own it but like it!
lol. this isn't even fair. NOBODY owns gold, NOBODY buys 4M MCs, NOBODY will buy oil in QC, NOBODY like Joe Fraud!
3201 2018-09-11 17:48:53 Mack came with me this morning to get an oil change cause he knew I’d keep procrastinating until my car exploded. GET U A RIDE OR DIE BITCH LIKE DAT 
3202 2018-09-11 17:48:43 I brought stuff to do while waiting on my oil change, and all of it requires a pen... and literally no ones in the office to ask...
3203 2018-09-11 17:48:38 Yeah, because most of pollution is caused by a few big coal and oil companies that own lots of oil rigs/coal mines, with the lucrative money they make they could easily cover the costs of pollution but that would detract slightly from their bottom line, Capitalism
3204 2018-09-11 17:48:34 Vajpayee also left the next government to repay oil bonds he issued.
3205 2018-09-11 17:48:27 63 billion gallons of oil are used in the US for water bottles each year. 90% are only used once. 2 million tons of plastic going into US landfills. I have used a disposable water bottle twice in one year. It is not that hard to do.
3206 2018-09-11 17:48:27 Garlic bread and chicken Alfredo  OIL

3208 2018-09-11 17:47:57 True. We are paying for the 2lakh crores oil bond pledge, 1 lakh crores coal bond pledge, in addition to the NPA's of over 9 lakh crores from 2008 as per Mr. Raghuram Rajan.
3209 2018-09-11 17:47:56 Brent oil over $79. Eighty, here we come. Demand is robust and Trump shut Iran just as demand is going to be strongest. Blame OPEC.
3210 2018-09-11 17:47:43 Came to get an oil change and now they trying to sale me a new truck
3211 2018-09-11 17:47:38 You are the one pushing a conspiracy narrative .. that Russia and allies are conspiring to thwart the noble aim to spread democracy and human rights and good governance in Syria and Iraq by the altruist USA.., nothing to do with controlling oil and supporting Israel of course
3212 2018-09-11 17:47:34 Atleast these taxes collected are not going I to pockets of corrupt ministers. Amount collected was used to pay 2L crore worth pending oil bills taken by UPA. Right now subsidy on Petrol Diesel is 0, so it's not affecting pockets of people who don't consume Petrol Diesel
3213 2018-09-11 17:47:26 Politicians fear speeking against Islam is explained by one word: OIL
3214 2018-09-11 17:47:16 Yes, but it’s like saying your car broke down because your tire was a little low even though you had no oil.
3215 2018-09-11 17:47:12 Toxic TL
3216 2018-09-11 17:47:10 The oil change place is part QB audible session "Bay 2, 405 filter. Check, Omaha!" and part up-sell lesson "Sir, we can change the fluids in your light bulbs for $59.99". How bout just empty old oil, put new filter and oil in. I pay. We all win.

3220 2018-09-11 17:46:49 It smells nice, but I'm thinking about adding oil to it for moisturizing.
3221 2018-09-11 17:46:43 Oh shut up Bernie with all your doomsday fear speak! Bet your stocks in oil futures are doing okay! Hypocrite!
3222 2018-09-11 17:46:36 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
3223 2018-09-11 17:46:21 I think my beard has dandruff because I scratched it three times during a meeting with a coworker and then slyly (re: obviously) brushed away some, what I'll be calling, dust. Can I use gun oil as beard oil?
3224 2018-09-11 17:46:09 trying to repair damaged hair from hair bleach is so wild man like i have olive oil in my hair rn and i feel like a healthy god
3225 2018-09-11 17:46:01 Finally I can get money for my form
3226 2018-09-11 17:45:39 My colleagues should watch @elleteedee, then they'd know that using latex gloves for working with oil is pretty useless.
3227 2018-09-11 17:45:38 Cracking excuse to explain where you got the oil. Its using a war they helped create and promote to steal it's riches. No wonder the UK PM and #DOLT45 dance to murdoch tune. Can't wait for Syria to retake the Golan.
3228 2018-09-11 17:45:32 I believe it's now up to Khamenei to decide how to resolve this mess. If they want EU cooperation for oil sales to Europe after 4 November when US oil sanctions go into effect, they must follow FATF guidelines, not EC's! Otherwise FATF will blacklist Iran, an unmitigated disaster
3229 2018-09-11 17:45:30 Pass the rye bread, olive oil, salt and fresh basil.
3230 2018-09-11 17:45:29 Got my baby an oil change today .

3232 2018-09-11 17:45:27 Truffle oil. The new love of my life.
3233 2018-09-11 17:45:26 So you're supported by a guy who thinks the only reason oil rich Venezuela is in crisis is because it isn't socialist enough and displays a plaque to IRA terrorists. 

Doesn't that make even you lot feel a teensy bit embarrassed, because it says a lot about you!
3234 2018-09-11 17:45:21 I remember one loon on here say “Nissan should be focusing on the Middle East not Europe!”

Yeah all those oil sheiks are going to trade their Lamborghini’s for a Juke 
3235 2018-09-11 17:45:20 came to get my oil changed and everyone is staring at me bc I brought my lunch 6 am clinicals ain’t a joke 
3236 2018-09-11 17:45:17 Am I washed for being excited about an oil change?
3237 2018-09-11 17:45:15 In Venezuela most of the economy is privately owned or controlled by a populist anc corrupt kleptocracy rather like neighbouring Brazil. Over reliance on oil had crippled the Venezuelan economy long before Chavez

3242 2018-09-11 17:44:40 Basically the season 1 guys tried to take away things in the house that have been specifically been sent in for Mumtaz considering her Heath issues (like olive oil and buffalo milk) saying that everyone should be treated equally! But BB later sent it back and said not to do it.

3244 2018-09-11 17:44:27 Sorry to hear Hannah, I can certainly recommend @sundayriley U.F.O dry facial oil. Salicylic acid at 1.5%, liquorice and tea tree to combat acne bacteria. The liquorice extract will also heal facial redness too Hannah. Let me know what you think! John

3253 2018-09-11 17:42:43 The total cost 12b$ or 14b$ is bcoz of electricity generation and if u want just dam reservoir then this can b built in 8b$ to 10b$.. Cost of the electricity generation will b 3-4 rupee per unit and if u generate electricity through furnace oil then its cost 12 rupee per unit.
3254 2018-09-11 17:42:28 17 years ago today I was in school and all the teachers were panicked. I lived 10 miles from Cushing, OK. The largest crude oil storage in America. Everyone around me thought we were next. Everyone was lined up to get gas and leave town.

Even the 'sustainable' stuff isn’t good for the environment and is 50% saturated fat!

Rapeseed oil is produced in the UK (so much lower carbon footprint amongst other things) and is much healthier at only 7% saturated fat.

I really like the colors and shading used in this piece. The sunlight really comes through in this.
3275 2018-09-11 17:39:48 Who said that? And with women doing the cooking for literal centuries, I can guarantee that more women cook than men. Just because you, ostensibly, know how to cook, doesn’t mean most men know how to cook. Just like not all men know how to change their oil.

3280 2018-09-11 17:39:13 I think our refineries only work with crude oil supplied from Iran.
3281 2018-09-11 17:39:11 Are people happy with the oil prices? Then? 
Just a thought. I travelled in a train in mumbai even during the 92-93 riots. So were there no riots then?

3326 2018-09-11 17:34:11 It is good such an initiative is fast gathering momentum. We are needlessly importing soy bean and crude oil.

A similar success has been realised by sugar cane outgrowers in the Lowveld who are producing a sizeable fraction of the feed stock into the 2 sugar mills. All the best!

The sun is estimated to last for another 5 billion years. Pretty reliable.

3386 2018-09-11 17:27:47 Fucking ignorant people.....this is a the sad result of decades of the US-Britain-Israel alliance demonizing Muslims because they want the land and oil...... Sad how much our society is manipulated into such worldviews....
3387 2018-09-11 17:27:46 Fun facts: 

Crude oil
 priced roughly at $58 in may 2009
 Priced at roughly $103 on may 2014
Priced at roughly $68 as of day before yesterday.

Im going to let the awesome statistical  prople do the math.
3388 2018-09-11 17:27:38 "Uh-oh, Skipper? Looks like number 4 has stopped leaking oil here.  I think we have a problem."
3389 2018-09-11 17:27:37 Why exactly is oil up today?  Is it algo-tastic fuckery, or have I misunderstood the newsflow?  I would think a lessening of Iranian oil supply disruption would be overall brearish for prices in the short-medium term, especially since it's been a big question mark for a while.
3390 2018-09-11 17:27:32 2/2 There were lines for gas. The Holland Oil at Market and Pershing was backed up to Wiltshire. The sky was eerily quiet but silence was broken occasionally as military aircraft flew over West Akron. I remember we ordered a big box of @SwensonsDriveIn and watched the news.

3392 2018-09-11 17:27:28 Sadly we can't. Oil is still the backbone of our modern civilization, unless we find new renewable fuel that are as practical as oil.
3393 2018-09-11 17:27:24 It has been said they have a few thousand barrels of oil to sell from their controlling interest. A few more to come too #ukog

3398 2018-09-11 17:26:51 And we have enough oil supplies of our own except for the left would rather put regulations on crap so we can’t drill our own. So I guess in a sense the left is the one wanting war in other places for oil
3399 2018-09-11 17:26:41 Try it first original way then try variations... have a Lovely cardamom oil that would be nice too.. add some roasted pistachios 
3400 2018-09-11 17:26:38 Actually she did. It was in their election policies. Plus, the oil industry was asking for it, and still do.
3401 2018-09-11 17:26:32 For real, though, I went to a French restaurant in Tokyo (I KNOW, I KNOW) and they straight made fresh mayo from oil and eggs at the table (!) for the fresh cut fries.  It. Was. Heaven.

I think that what I really wanted was just a glass of cooking oil with a spoonful of salt.

3425 2018-09-11 17:23:57 What it also means is that the Dated Brent benchmark will fall due to how it is constructed meaning all oil producers that sell versus dated Brent will receive less revenue.

3428 2018-09-11 17:23:48 The way oil producing countries are developed, i wonder what type of oil my county produce. Is it coconut oil or groundnut oil ?
3429 2018-09-11 17:23:14 If you have axe-like hand moving in a pendulum way,with hooked curved end striking a ball connected to a rotor endlessly, can replace oil?
3430 2018-09-11 17:23:13 If we switch to Nuclear, wind and solar, which would be quite a bit cheaper than oil and coal, we would also save about 4 million lives per year due to air pollution.

3433 2018-09-11 17:23:06 My guess, the Yzerman decision was more about life-balance than anything else. The guy has essentially been at it since his rookie year in 1983-84. Likely the time had come to step away and start enjoying life with his wife.

3451 2018-09-11 17:21:03 Loved it!
3452 2018-09-11 17:21:00 It is because oil prices have risen.
3453 2018-09-11 17:20:59 My point is that Venezuela was "socialist" before Chavez and Maduro. It supported this habit by huge income from petroleum. I presume that, when oil prices went down, their ability to import essentials collapsed. What are new policies (beyond label) which you attribute to Chavez?

GTFOH with your mightier than thou bullshit. Every club is built on money from 1 source or another.
3461 2018-09-11 17:19:51 Right! As I’m into oil and gas ladies now de3, you should know. Was only tryna consider you again
3462 2018-09-11 17:19:23 What if you found out 911 was a hoax that was planned to give America a reason to attack a country for oil because they knew they where running out. Gas prices went way down and now they occupy the oil with a building & Soldiers?
3463 2018-09-11 17:19:19 The truth is, federal methane rules were an unnecessary regulation, just another Obama-era intrusion into state's rights. Every state with oil and gas production already has methane capture rules. The pollution claims made in the @nytimes article are NOT accurate.

3475 2018-09-11 17:18:24 These ethanol blending regulations started when there was a fear that US have to be dependent on the foreign oil supply for vehicle fuels. Since this trend is reversed now, with US producing record quantities of oil, there is not much incentive to keep mixing ethanol.

3484 2018-09-11 17:17:40 If we assess our own travels a number of trips we can easily save using cycle and public transport. If this becomes our usual habit demand of crude oil will decrease. I am not bothered at all what others are doing but feel glad I am doing it cheerfully.
3485 2018-09-11 17:17:25 Yes let's not just reduce dependence on foreign oil but let's make sure oil and coal companies go out of business. They're irrelevant now to a changing economy.

3501 2018-09-11 17:15:58 You weren't technically at war but you're right. The reason they kicked off is because you put many trade embargoes (especially oil) on them because of their expansion into Asia and boi did they need the oil for the war effort.

3528 2018-09-11 17:13:22 Quite lovely. I was thinking that the spaces should stay nice & oil drip free indefinitely, then I remembered PHEVs...

3536 2018-09-11 17:12:37 Any increase in oil prices will be short-lived if indeed we break $70 WTI. The net energy available from oil is decreasing as we move to unconventional sources and so too is the amount we can pay.

3544 2018-09-11 17:10:53 yes. Also, Venezuela situation is unique in Latin America. It combined usual bureaucratic feudalism of Latin American countries with large oil revenues in 1980s and 1990s, all under control of government.  Doing anything required permits and more permits long before Chavez.

We lied about WMD, used it as an excuse to invade an oil producing country for resources and we started wholesale torture and killing. And it was supported by most Americans.

3573 2018-09-11 17:08:18 Instead of going ham and exploring and perfecting alternative fuel for cars, we should instead focus on mass-producing synthetic gasoline and diesel.  why?

When we face the inevitable oil shortage, we can still power vehicles that use these fuels with synthetic fuel.

3584 2018-09-11 17:06:58 Does it prioritize innovation in renewable energy resources? If the answer is no, then it does NOTHING to make America "energy independent". Energy infrastructure must be updated to include energy from renewable sources, so we can put coal and oil to rest and fight climate change

3588 2018-09-11 17:06:22 Petrol affects middle class, which is mostly opinionated and less likely to change. Price of onion, tomato, potatoes under check. If the govt can convince d beneficiaries of the above commodities well by door to door, then 2004 won’t be repeated despite high oil price.

3627 2018-09-11 17:02:40 Pipelines are used to transport the fossil fuels extracted by fracking. If there were no fracked gas or oil, there would be no need for pipelines to transport them. The whole process, end-to-end, is extremely hazardous. We should be moving to renewables.

3630 2018-09-11 17:02:33 The involvement of Genie and Afek in the Golan was not about finding oil, which they didn't,  but more about piping Syrian Oil into Israel and the Med. Ports. IMHO. Claiming it as their own.

3634 2018-09-11 17:01:56 US economy is like neither.  Witness what happened to US oil production as oil went from $10 to $150 in 8 yrs.  Oil production boomed, stimulating the economy on net.

This holds true for virtually all the US consumes - we can produce it at a price, making Weimar highly unlikely

3645 2018-09-11 17:00:47 For pity sake . What ignites my fury is not just the verbal diarrhoea spewed out by these religious Snake Oil Salesmen. It’s the ignorant folk who actually believe it as fact
3646 2018-09-11 17:00:45 I thought our oil was still at the prospective stage?
3647 2018-09-11 17:00:30 Growing up is realizing 9/11 was really an inside job. We've spent 17 years, lost thousands of people's lives, torn apart more families for oil & other things. We've spent 17 years trying to instill our thoughts and beliefs by gunpoint and then THEY get called the terrorist.

3653 2018-09-11 17:00:13 Lots of co2 in the air.

Some from burning oil+coal (which also cause global warming)

Some from over-farming. All the carbon in the top soil is being mined.

Either way, co2 is correlated to some of the activities also causing climate change. 

Correlation, sure.
Causality, meh

3660 2018-09-11 16:59:42 Global demand for oil is increasing despite what all the anti carbon zealots would like to believe. Wishful thinking & oil smear campaigns won't make this energy industry go away.

3662 2018-09-11 16:59:20 It may get there eventually, but it's not there yet. Despite the inefficiencies of solar panels they are constantly improving in terms of yield, efficiency and longevity. I'm not naive enough to think they are the only solution, but it is better long term than coal and oil.

After seeing what we did to those poor people and then seeing British Petroleum, Halliburton, and KBR get rich off their oil and our tax money, the whole thing makes my stomach turn just thinking about Americans dying for that. There was no real glory there.

3716 2018-09-11 16:54:36 Lo que no se puede es improvisar. En 1956 la Standar Oil encargó un estudio a la Unv.

3733 2018-09-11 16:53:15 The elite began to leave and oil workers resigned in masse due to no $. Lack of duverse industry investment is what brought Venezuela down. That could happen here as Bernie Sanders too has been a staunch advocate for keeping jobs in the US and coming down hard

3738 2018-09-11 16:52:43 There is no physical product in insurance. Fixing cars, replacing furniture, defending law suits, cleaning up oil spills are usually done by partner service firms. We print fewer policies, process fewer bills, and issue fewer checks.

3757 2018-09-11 16:51:02 One interesting consideration in scaling back rather than repealing the oil and gas methane new source rules: obligation to regulate existing sources under section 111(d) remains. 

Now EPA can delay, but it'll face legal challenge and will allow a future EPA to act more quickly.
3758 2018-09-11 16:50:48 The central govt says that the states get fourty percent of central taxes on oil, and also get to keep the taxes accruing to them from the same.

Jobless in the market, ridiculous increase in excise duty, tax etc even when the crude oil rates were falling.. Nothing for us
3764 2018-09-11 16:50:26 9/11 was a WARNING, from Saudis & others: "Don't mess w/the oil arrangements. Honor the deals we made". Their entire economies depend on US oil purchase. The Bush's got greedy & tried something dirty, that threatened to hurt r allies. So allies fought back the only way they could

3766 2018-09-11 16:50:08 It's true these people want money more than helping people. They sell oil, water and other stuff to get more money.
3767 2018-09-11 16:49:54 - you're not washing your skin enough/thoroughly enough -> try using an oil cleanser before a water-based cleanser, the theory goes that oil dissolves oil so your skin has less oil on it
- your skin overproduces oil -> moisturise more, it makes oil to hydrate itself. if you don't
3768 2018-09-11 16:49:50 Almost there! Use oil just if you fried, but slice them like thin ties. From top to bottom. Dry and melt it in a mix of sugar and cinnamon. Use just water if you gonna cook. Slice like discs. Use the same mix. ;/)

3777 2018-09-11 16:49:22 As tax efficiency increases (we now have GST in place), Govts should stop depending on taxes on oil.

Immature economies depend on two main sources of taxation - oil and import tariffs. Both are easy to implement.

3779 2018-09-11 16:49:21 I’ve never met anyone else with an avo allergy! Is it just raw avocados, or does it include oil? I can use the oil in cooking but I can’t eat it raw.  I figured it out when I had guac for the first time, lol

Even if Otedola campaigned for 4 years, APC’s second term is as sure as the dawn I REPEAT.

Emergency no dey politics matter, it’s a marathon. Otedola just wan dash people Forte Oil money. Kapish!
3784 2018-09-11 16:48:55 #Saudis have too much oil to give them the back of our hand. And it's their soul that is in crisis. We want to draw them in rather than freeze them out.

3789 2018-09-11 16:48:28 You see a rather nice oil painting at an auction with a guide price £1,000 would you go up the the auction desk & say I've brought £50 thousand can you keep it in your safe, as you would be bid up. Wonder if Mrs May is as rash with her own money as with ours for EU?
3790 2018-09-11 16:48:28 99% guarantee the first draft of Operation Iraqi Freedom was titled Operation Oil Baby!
3791 2018-09-11 16:48:24 Yepper. The year a Republican POTUS brought on the attack of the World Trade Center because his father put us in a religious war to save the Bush family's oil profits. What's next? WW3 by the current lunatic POTUS?

if you break out bc of sensitivity you should use a lower concentration of acid (using it less often probs helps) and also not use the problem that makes you break out anyway
if it's an oil thing, some reasons why this is is bc

3801 2018-09-11 16:46:49 Why do people freak out about “bottled water” running out before a major storm?

Get several jugs. Fill them up from your sink or tub  b4 the storm.

We are so spoiled!  

After Hurricane Hugo I recall bathing in a creek and using oil lanterns! 

Prepare, & be resourceful.

3805 2018-09-11 16:46:19 This oil had worked.
3806 2018-09-11 16:46:07 The party that wants gun control yet always seek violence against anyone they disagree with politicalcally.  Oil and water do not mix and this logic is worst than oil and water.  #WalkAway

3809 2018-09-11 16:45:47 The acrylics might make it harder for you to wrap!  I use cuticle oil on my nails everyday because I have an issue with dry cuticles, and I haven’t really gotten any hangnails ever since! I also cut my cuticles regularly because they’re so thick but you gots to be careful!
3810 2018-09-11 16:45:40 So because of cheaper Iranian oil which Trump is not allowing Idia to buy, Modi is requesting for a meal at Camp David. Man what a weird logic. You have a friend in Puppu & a Phd in Puppulogic !
3811 2018-09-11 16:45:23 amazing Lorna, thanks so much for the tip! I haven't tried peanut oil but will be doing so asap

3814 2018-09-11 16:45:02 Wish FSU had some of that oil money.
3815 2018-09-11 16:45:02 @MittRomney moved here because there is more gas and oil money in UT than in MA. #BainCapitalisallweneedtoknow
3816 2018-09-11 16:44:53 When I received my first oil change, they found that an additive was put into the engine and made some parts lockup after draining it. Carmax wants nothing to do with me now. I can fix it myself and posted more detail in my GoFundMe link. I thank you for your support!
3817 2018-09-11 16:44:51 9/11 happened and we responded by going to Iraq.  And 3000 people died in 9/11 that was Bush's fault. You Republicans pretend to be all patriotic but all you are is a death cult that likes war and stealing oil from other countries. So patriotic you sell weapons to the Saudis.
3818 2018-09-11 16:44:49 Or the fact America is vertualy stealing it's oil .
3819 2018-09-11 16:44:47 Remember even Vajpayee give raised oil bonds which the UPA govt paid ... so what’s new ?
3820 2018-09-11 16:44:47 When Iran wanted to nationalize oil so profits could help ppl & not foreign oil companies we forced a coup & put in a dictator. Vietnam & Korea we started wars because we didn't like their choice in government. If socialism is so bad why can't we sit back & watch it implode?
3821 2018-09-11 16:44:43 Olive Oil could have whipped it all, fishing in the court.
3822 2018-09-11 16:44:42 sure, it was a government conspiracy and jet fuel and oil and white people are the devil.

3837 2018-09-11 16:43:41 About to complain that he's making her work, but she also wants to try tasty salmon.

"Uhh....."

Looking around, not really knowing where anything is, it takes her a few moments to find the requested items.

"I found coconut oil, will that work?"
3838 2018-09-11 16:43:39 You don't want #Iran controlling that #oil.

3841 2018-09-11 16:43:33 I did it once for pictures and then took them off w oil and my eyelashes came out w it so I just never did it again. The trio lashes work really well just to make your eyelashes look thicker

3844 2018-09-11 16:43:28 My Italian bicycle mechanic/bike shop owner says that he doesn’t know why his bike gets so dirty in the US vs in Italia. My guess is pollution, garbage juice on the streets and oil on the streets here. Gross. I clean my bike often.

PS: I'll need a new autographed Sahara Testaments, 'anointing oil' washed the words off the old one. They're in my heart though.
3849 2018-09-11 16:42:59 Totally agree. They sponsor Wahabism and terrorism around the world. They fund anti- oil projects around the world. They treat women like shit. The Stone Age must come to an end.

3857 2018-09-11 16:42:13 Quit bashing the Clintons. GWB refused the briefings that named OSB a threat, and received the stolen goods of an election to do so. Bush family had oil interests, shook hands with those they later assassinated, so were WAY more involved than the Cs. The scales weigh against you.
3858 2018-09-11 16:41:53 A tad more baking powder than what you think...and if you can give your dough an extra hour or two at the rest, just a little yeast. Light, and a bit more chewy. (Also if you have family members with a cholesterol problem, fry it in peanut oil, it still tastes good!)
3859 2018-09-11 16:41:49 Marijuana gives dogs anxiety bc they don’t know wtf Is going on. There’s cbd oil for dogs for pain which is much better than giving a dog an edible don’t try to debate this.
3860 2018-09-11 16:41:47 Wow so you talked about massive commitment of our Canadian Government to support and help build the clean green renewable energy infrastructure grid across Canada ? Also to outlaw the process that allows idiots to give billions of Canadians tax dollars to foreign oil companies ?!
3861 2018-09-11 16:41:43 Good idea. Tho maybe late. Oil might go higher after Sept OPEC meeting in Algeria. Now its pricing in Iran sanctions.

3868 2018-09-11 16:41:18 So the “oil shock” as you put it was why bodies weren’t being buried, rubbish not collected, power cuts, just about every nationalised industry on strike! Couldn’t have possibly been the rampant, unchecked power of the Unions could it! Go back and check your history!!
3869 2018-09-11 16:41:16 By the efforts of this Mr Big Man Trump, would anyone be surprised if 9/11 happened today? 17 years after that sad day, has America sowed more hate or more love, would you say?
3870 2018-09-11 16:41:12 i watch that video of lizzo playing the flute part of coconut oil whenever i’m about to have an anxiety attack it helps so much

3907 2018-09-11 16:38:27 Oh my god, he thinks he should be  using US military power (American blood and treasure) to get oil from other countries.  Is the reason none of the GOP leaders will not do anything this is because Putin or the National Enquirer has captured them by having something on them?
3908 2018-09-11 16:38:19 Oil what else.

3930 2018-09-11 16:35:55 Comrade Larry; how much oil stock does your experts own? Sun light is free. No profits for you to bad. Stop your bull shit lies. High electric cost are there now, to bad you have so much money, you didn't notice. ?? Did TEP pay you ??

3933 2018-09-11 16:35:38 And yet our government has never held Saudi Arabia accountable. Why is that? Money? Oil? Arms?
3934 2018-09-11 16:35:37 Argon oil is what cleared my skin.
3935 2018-09-11 16:35:31 Better late than never, no more reliance on oil producing countries, Putin, Saudis, Iran, we can catch up fast by giving subsidies to rental firms using electric vehicals, cars,bikes,cycles.

POOF! GO ME!
3939 2018-09-11 16:34:51 Good choices! The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil would have been great to see with an audience, or maybe London Calling. Braveheart's great fun, but it's not meant for serious political rallies.
3940 2018-09-11 16:34:50 You’re 100% right Laura. But I think President Trump and his leaders will eventually call out Saudi Arabia on 9/11. We used to need their oil, we don’t no more   President Trump lifted regulations and now we export more oil than we import
3941 2018-09-11 16:34:48 Good, when do we attack Saudi Arabia for the large part they played ? Oh, we get oil there, oh so no attack, we attacked IRAN and IRAQ instead. Stop with the BS, if Security was really big, Trump would be impeached or neutered. The R's are more dangerous than any enemy right now.

It really is a magical world

Kassian was terrible on the PK last season and both those PTOs were PK regulars on their teams.

3959 2018-09-11 16:33:21 I know y'all have this love for Femi Otedola, but honestly I can't rate someone who knowingly sabotaged what would have been the biggest oil probe in Nigeria's history. 

He walked free & Nigeria perhaps missed a golden chance to be liberated from the stronghold of the oil cabal.
3960 2018-09-11 16:33:17 Have seen 6 full oil tankers sat off the south coast for weeks waiting on the oil price to rise , I was in oil and gas for years
3961 2018-09-11 16:33:04 Charity is the Samaritan who pours oil on the wounds of the traveler who has been attacked. It is justice's role to prevent the attack.
3962 2018-09-11 16:33:04 That's some bullshit. That's that premium oil shit you don't need for your car. It shouldn't be over $50 dafuqqqq
3963 2018-09-11 16:32:47 I believe govt when they claim-

1. Direct tax has increased due to #demo
2. Economy is doing good after #GST (means more tax from corp.)
3. It has cracked down on Tax evaders.

But this is also why i expect them to stop bleeding us with oil prices. Stop being greedy, u hv enuf.

3966 2018-09-11 16:32:27 Guyana...actually only has oil now. The gold and diamonds have been sold and they put none in the reserves, so yeah, I hope they don’t drop the ball on this.

3972 2018-09-11 16:31:38 It really is. Its enough going on to remember how we didnt even go afyer the folk that did it because we like oil and sacrificed millions more people to topple and attempt to take over countries we already installed dictators who just reneged on the deal. Same with Syria.

3985 2018-09-11 16:30:06 Yes and no! Hemp oil is specifically derived from hemp! CBD oil can be derived from either hemp or marijuana!
3986 2018-09-11 16:30:04 Boil some oil and then massage it in the lower tummy area? Hot packs? Anything soothing like that??

3988 2018-09-11 16:29:51 Agreed, I love to cook. I also think women should learn how to change a tire and change the oil in their cars, do basic household repairs, assemble furniture, fight, shoot, fish, hunt, and talk mad shit over IPAs, but maybe I'm just a feminist.

3996 2018-09-11 16:28:54 Oil money is steeped in corruption and abuses of power, but only because all centralized power corrupts. I proposed a $5/gallon gasoline tax in 2004 after we invaded Iraq on a fake 9/11 connection, called it a "Freedom tax" to help equalized playing field to more honest sources.
3997 2018-09-11 16:28:54 There's a pattern here...  

Kissinger: "Control oil and you control nations; control food and you control the people." 

Amschel Rothschild: "Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws!"
3998 2018-09-11 16:28:48 Is Hemp Oil the same as CBD oil?
3999 2018-09-11 16:28:48 He could be wrong. But as electricity is the basis of our modern civilization, how should we generate it? Nuclear? Solar? Wind? Tidal? Hydro? Gas? Oil? Wood? It's a tricky issue, involving developed and developing areas.
4000 2018-09-11 16:28:47 You're 100% correct. The oil in mayo has a much higher burning point then butter and you get a perfectly toasted sandwich every time. Tastes a little better then butter too without approximately the same calories!
4001 2018-09-11 16:28:46 Clean and cool water is life.  You can't treat streams and rivers like toilets without consequences.

I grew up not too far from the Cuyahoga River - so polluted it caught on fire in June 1969.

That's why we need the EPA - oil slicks, lead, etc. - bad for fish and children
4002 2018-09-11 16:28:07 Not tryna go too in depth but it was all a set up for different reasons. One being so they have a reason to go to war and get shit like their oil and other things
4003 2018-09-11 16:27:49 My wife really likes cooking and is really good at it, so generally she cooks and I do the dishes. It’s not an expectation by any means, any more than it’s an expectation for me to change the oil in her car. Do people really still gender role like that??
4004 2018-09-11 16:27:48 Our military is not that big. It may cost alot more but it is not as big as it says...and i do agree with militarized dumbo though. Why stay in the mideast...just focus on the US and our oil supplies and let them do what they will.
4005 2018-09-11 16:27:46 How you the manager throwing hot oil on ppl not once but 3 times she snapped and risked her freedom for a goofy ass argument....and them girls getting cashed out!

4038 2018-09-11 16:25:18 You cannot eat gold or silver. Not even oil. (we have lots of oil) More important, we have cattle and over productive agriculture.

4041 2018-09-11 16:25:05 Tofu CAN be made to taste good, by a sufficiently skilled chef.

He started by frying little cubes of the stuff in very hot oil in a wok. Once they were browned, he doused them in a sauce involving garlic & ginger, which made the little cubes no-longer taste like tofu.

4061 2018-09-11 16:23:15 I mean, if it's any consolation to the Chileans, and I highly doubt it is, the Yom Kippur War happened a month later and a crippling oil embargo affected the entire West. I still personally see that as karma.

4087 2018-09-11 16:20:47 Ive heard that the State of Texas has maintained ownership of half the mineral rights for properties in Texas. So in Texas half the income of oil n gas produced in Texas goes to public funding. Is this true?
4088 2018-09-11 16:20:43 Will you ask them why gas is so high for American consumers??  

Supposedly we have more oil than we we know what to do with and are exporting it around the world.  Shouldn't our prices be a historic lows?????

4161 2018-09-11 16:15:21 Clearly iron age beasts you can tell by the rust and the chains
and by the oil that they bleed the crew and crows fly the skulls and bones
4162 2018-09-11 16:15:17 Our essential oil specials are always changing! Stop in today and see what's on sale.  #LivingWellDallas #EssentialOils
4163 2018-09-11 16:15:02 Scenarios, scenarios, what we need is policy now starting with off grid, new build & phase out of oil.  Not discussing unproven technologies that may have their place.  Electrification of heat using heat pumps is the only proven solution which is happening in the rest of Europe
4164 2018-09-11 16:15:01 Also I got that cbd oil pen that you got (cause I wanna be like you) and I’m grateful
4165 2018-09-11 16:15:00 WALA NANG CHILI OIL SA MAIN!!!
4166 2018-09-11 16:14:59 You near any kind of oil doesn't end well.
4167 2018-09-11 16:14:59 The large Oil & Gas companies will still follow these regulations even if they don't exist anymore, the reason is that they spent a lot of money to implement these regulations & they want to avoid lawsuits. It is the smaller companies who may take advantage of the De-regulations.

4171 2018-09-11 16:14:28 I was using that coconut body oil too but it solidified every time I tried to use it and then it was such a hassle to melt :( or maybe I’m just lazy haha
4172 2018-09-11 16:14:27 Man you done went the oil field way and said fuck us

4175 2018-09-11 16:14:12 9/11 did not have to happen but we had a man in power who also was not elected by the people.  We had a VP who cared more about money from war and oil and reconstruction than the people of our country.  So thousands suffer missing loved ones. Politics is not a game.
4176 2018-09-11 16:14:06 I could easily pick one for every mask, even the Flames, but we'll stick with the Oilers years ;)
4177 2018-09-11 16:14:05 EU is like an oil supertanker, with a long and slow turning circle. The time to do something was 20years ago. The current crop of EU 'officials' are not fit for purpose and EU lost its way many years ago, this lot won't help it get back to where it could be.

4180 2018-09-11 16:13:58 Mr. Otedola, Chairman/CEO of Forte Oil, has accepted to run for the governorship seat of the Lagos State under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).The Boss can confirm that the party offered the billionaire oil magnate the ticket of the party, & he wholeheartedly
4181 2018-09-11 16:13:58 One noticeable change in your regime is the rise of crude oil...
4182 2018-09-11 16:13:57 Yea I rock with Coconut oil as well. Will do
4183 2018-09-11 16:13:57 While claiming he was the only one who did understand them .... he is quite the  oil salesman
4184 2018-09-11 16:13:41 Yeah too bad he drowned in cooking oil
4185 2018-09-11 16:13:31 I’ve been using almond oil and @WholeFoods only $4.99/bottle! Or wait until @RonaldIntern, @jaminbrazil and I bring a more conventient way to add to you diet. 
4186 2018-09-11 16:13:29 A Artist Space called Damned Incorporate where you massage beards with coconut oil while building erotic intimacy
4187 2018-09-11 16:13:23 I agree, me kids are lovely. One man phoned Devon Debates today & said his son is 14, can strip a truck engine & change the oil! Helps his Dad with the horses etc. He has strict boundaries & doesn’t cross them. No child is perfect, can’t expect them to be but some are awful
4188 2018-09-11 16:13:21 I had to put my coconut oil in the freezer because it's too hot to keep it in the bathroom and I immediately wanted it. It's a fun trick until you need it
4189 2018-09-11 16:13:19 No country can survive with AFRICA.... without cargo from Africa nothing would have ever happened for Europe. You wouldn’t even have a phone. Give our .. gold ...oil ...resources... PEOPLE BACK.
4190 2018-09-11 16:13:02 can you sub the coconut oil for butter and just ignore that part of the recipe? it's a 1:1 ratio
4191 2018-09-11 16:12:55 At the doctors a little earlier, I asked him what he thought of the lchf diet and showed him some screenshots of Gunt's advice, such as shove pork scratchings down your throat and add oil to coffee etc. He shook his head and said 'blocked arteries await'. All lies though Jon eh?
4192 2018-09-11 16:12:53 When your neghbour wants 2 run a pipeline full of oil right thru your backyard putting your home & all that’s in it at risk—the sheer lack of respect for BC by Alberta’s  R. Notely’s threats, boycotts, & inability 2 discuss & compromise has been the biggest red flag for BC.
4193 2018-09-11 16:12:52 they claim "US interests" in the region..!
as far as i can tell, the only us interests are those of the oil barons, the US is energy independent now, why do we need to go and die for some bankers yet again.? wake up u fools...
4194 2018-09-11 16:12:50 Me, near hot oil..... that wouldn’t end well!
4195 2018-09-11 16:12:49 Don't get me wrong, I don't think he'll be back or even should be this season. Point being, if the chance of him being healthy is there the LTIR angle can't be used. Only way they could do it is if the player is on board.
4196 2018-09-11 16:12:46 Make we use oil chop yam. Make we use Yam chop Oil.
4197 2018-09-11 16:12:38 As has been well documented, this is to raise a big chunk of money for GM and NAIT hockey programs...a lot of great reasons to crap on the Oil, but this isn't just them nickel and diming.
4198 2018-09-11 16:12:37 If China, India, Russia, EU jointly issue a statement saying they will keep buying Iranian oil then it will make things really interesting.

4201 2018-09-11 16:12:14 I still remember 2015 when every value, garp, and otherwise fundamental investor jumped into oil and shale names bc they were 4-5x EBIDTA etc. 

Need a chart, and some additional scrutiny big picture imo.
4202 2018-09-11 16:12:08 Weird, this is the reply I remember cancelling, bc I had more to say. I don't see the other comment I tweeted that ellaborated.
You're not alone! I also have BC in my emergency kit. Have DE to add. Also coconut oil, sea salt, activated charcoal.
4203 2018-09-11 16:12:06 Trump and his good ol boy buddies of big oil had direct causality to it all in the first place.

4205 2018-09-11 16:12:00 you are so shameless. UPA & MMS lent recklessly and to push GDP and now u say that there is a list now you (NDA) go and collect!! Further MMS gave a PDC for oil subsidy to the OMC, and NDA has to settle that too. So MMS was no more an economist but PA to Sonia
4206 2018-09-11 16:11:50 Sir pl focus on oil prices rise...Feeling cheated to pay tax in this country...
4207 2018-09-11 16:11:46 You kno summer over when ya coconut oil is solid as a rock lol
4208 2018-09-11 16:11:44 Sure. But let's also acknowledge the fact that Modi got a Mahalucky Binanza when Oil dropped from over $100 to less than $30. He did use the windfall nicely.....Although now is probably the time to get Petrol products under GST; which would totally screw up his finances !!!

But remember, on 9/11/2001 we were attacked by zero Iranians, zero Iraqis, and zero Afghans
.
15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, educated, trained, & financed by Saudi money made from U.S. oil companies.

Honor September 11th by remembering the truth.
4210 2018-09-11 16:11:19 If you believe that carbon emissions are a key cause of climate change, it makes sense that you would oppose the expansion of a permanent piece of infrastructure to transport oil.
4211 2018-09-11 16:11:17 Oil your big boobs goddess
4212 2018-09-11 16:11:17 Yes, and we went too! I imagine we were the post-war army of occupation, as it was previously Italian. It was a wealthy kingdom, stable and oil wealthy. We had lovely accommodation, and a school staffed by british teachers. A far cry from the conditions in English garrison towns.
4213 2018-09-11 16:11:15 But isn't true also that govt has made profit when crude oil prices very low in initial 3 years? Debt cleared is around 2 lac correspondence but profit made through taxes is around 7 lacs. Did they pass on the benifit of low crude oil price after clearing the debt?

4220 2018-09-11 16:10:42 Mainly, congress is accountable for steep oil prices. What congress sown, BJP is reaping. Take huge loans from foreign, which is being paid by ruling Govt. Now congress accuses BJP for this irregularitiy.

4239 2018-09-11 16:09:20 US can't compete until USD monopoly ends.

4252 2018-09-11 16:08:26 Oil companies don't receive subsidies.  You intentionally confuse a business keeping more of their own money to someone like Musk getting five billion dollars in government checks.  Not even the same thing.

4257 2018-09-11 16:08:00 I think the government and lobbyist conspired with the terrorist. War put money in their hands because the government had to pay for munitions and such. I’m sure all the oil over there was a factor too
4258 2018-09-11 16:07:57 How often do you really need to change your oil; is time or distance/ usage the important metric?#CastrolChallenge
4259 2018-09-11 16:07:57 Interesting Fact...Mexico is the world's eighth largest producer of oil, at almost 3 million barrels per day. This is less than Canada, Iran, or Iraq but more than other big exporters such as Kuwait, Brazil, or Nigeria.  

More help for Russian oil needs from trump tariffs?

4265 2018-09-11 16:07:17 True. Saudi isnt even a real country. Its an islamic tyranny with oil.
4266 2018-09-11 16:07:09 Arey , actually it's because of the subsidy they take, there has been a price bike. They donot put GST on the oil, rather a different tax. They are being told to relax that tax, but they keep saying 2009 ko UPA sarkar ne ye kia, woh kia. They matlab bjp.
4267 2018-09-11 16:07:05 .....IF US were in a position to count on oil producers such as Iran and Venezuela, to replace Saudi Arabian oil exports, it would have been a different story. Another words, the Arabic speaking Mullahs of Iran have in fact made Saudi Arabia very precious to US.

C'mon he still does this. Also, finishing salt?
4272 2018-09-11 16:06:34 Agreed.  Why I've been advocating that the USD losing its monopoly on pricing oil & commodities & it's use as primary reserve currency will result in US & global economic strength, not weakness.  US govt engaged in protectionism of USD status has been hurting the US for decades.
4273 2018-09-11 16:06:32 What was I doing when I heard. Thinking about the history of United States meddling and democracy building for the rights to oil that has destabilized the entire region, birthing terrorist organizations that came back to bite us. And just feeling sad for loss of life.

4280 2018-09-11 16:06:06 I wish you know the concept of gravity. Oil is bound to go down and into the contestant’s eye. Even after he showed pain, Kaushal didn’t stop putting oil and said its a game. If anything’s fair in game according to him, how’s it wrong if others do the same to him? KArmy is funny
4281 2018-09-11 16:06:00 also use a light layer of coconut oil on your hair a few hours before bleaching and it’ll help it not dry out as much (won’t affect the bleach at all)
4282 2018-09-11 16:06:00 Competition is a good thing.  This is why I have been advocating ending the USD's monopoly in the pricing of commodities & oil, and it's primary reserve status.  Allowing currency competition will be great for US, world economy (but bad for USD monopolists).

4288 2018-09-11 16:05:31 2. No.  The problem is see in Canada is the lack of sex appeal of research to drive  clinical excellence as it doesn't look as shiny and polished against marketing companies you tube editing the next best "snake oil". EBM needs better marketing.

4294 2018-09-11 16:04:45 Agreed.  Why I've been advocating that the USD losing its monopoly on pricing oil & commodities & it's use as primary reserve currency will result in US & global economic strength, not weakness.  US govt engaged in protectionism of USD status has been hurting the US for decades.
4295 2018-09-11 16:04:37 I need an apple muffin recipe with little to no sugar but it seems like every low sugar recipe also cuts out butter. And often they replace it with like, coconut oil. COCONUT OIL ISN'T ~HEALTHIER~ FFS. I just want to make my kid delicious muffins that aren't cake-sweet.

4312 2018-09-11 16:03:20 Getting my oil changed, I watch this guy pull up behind my car that is already being worked on, get it, and proceed to demand his oil be changed now because he’s in a hurry. Mechanic say ‘ok’ takes his key, parks it always as possible, continues working on my car

4335 2018-09-11 16:01:55 I think nationalising private businesses, gutting a state oil company to hand money out to supporters and cronies, relying on one commodity, and creating an oppressive political environment is really going to do it on its own.

4361 2018-09-11 15:59:43 Yeah, where do you see that in the budget? There are 2 subsidies, one for small oil wells  other only in force when the price of oil is very low. So eliminate them, they don't even add up to 1 billion.
4362 2018-09-11 15:59:40 Every time I get my oil changed at Jiffy Lube, they bring to my attention that I need new wipers, a new fuel filter, new brakes, new tires, new windows, new engine and a new car.

4385 2018-09-11 15:58:19 yeah the fact the algae oil can be done in desert non-arable land at a rate of 100,000 gallons per acre puts it so far beyond any other biofuel its in its own league.  Also gives a solution to agri waste, and perhaps human waste.

4422 2018-09-11 15:53:57 Also, if we are going to rely on local products, wave goodbye to oranges and mangoes and olive oil and i-phones and Samsung phones and Sony TVs and Braun washing machines. It's going to be turnips, turnips, all the way.
4423 2018-09-11 15:53:48 Found a brochure of a new store (toys, gardening tools, decoration, ...) in the mail and on the day of store opening men will get a free glass of beer and women will receive a little bottle of olive oil !?!? 
4424 2018-09-11 15:53:41 I guess we can debate "the chicken or the egg?" or we can just chow down on some good 'ol KFC. Kentucky Fried Cuckoo-birds, that is. 

Somebody start boiling some oil!
4425 2018-09-11 15:53:36 They have 2 choices. Keep it in the ground or store it in oil tankers as close to the market as they think they can sell it. When you decide to go for physical oil storage in a vessel you believe that oil prices will go up inside the next 2 years so that you can profit from it.
4426 2018-09-11 15:53:36 Remember that time Mueller investigated 911 attack by Saudi based terrorists and came to the collusion that Dick Cheney  needed oil lines in Iraq #Halliburton
4427 2018-09-11 15:53:21 The lesson to learn is that USA will go to any lengths to maintain divide & conquer policy in Middle East. It just so happens there are a lot of Abrahamics in that region as well as oil. I am surprised how passive Islam has been to the Neo Crusades. Where is your Saladin?
4428 2018-09-11 15:53:17 Crude oil price in 2013 was in between 91to 95 us dollars and dollar was 60. 2014 jan petrol was 71₹ in india and in 2015 till 2017 it was 60to72.

4430 2018-09-11 15:53:13 Fixed & did oil change on a couple of machines while wet first thing, cleared ends of ditches, finished flymowing & raking bunkers & cut some rough.
4431 2018-09-11 15:53:08 @Topgolf I will be at your Loudoun location next week and I saw that you have a few vegan options (fries, veggie burger). Are these items cooked with non-vegan items (fries cooked in same oil as meat, veggie burgers on same grill as meat, etc.)?
4432 2018-09-11 15:52:57 So the fta with the EU allowed the UK to compete into the South Korean market. Back to WTO means that no UK  crude oil will go to South Korea as no longer can compete unless it drops massively in price meaning oil companies make less profit and don’t invest in the North Sea
4433 2018-09-11 15:52:55 Will everthing be paid from oil's taxation only. Lots of other taxes are there and each of them has been increased. Reducing oil price can boost so many industries and business. It will help to control inflation too which BJP has always cried about.

4441 2018-09-11 15:52:25 INR nose-dived to a new historic low, ending at  Rs72.45 USD . Value eroded 12%  making it   one of Asia’s-worst  performing currencies. It was mostly weighed down by rising global crude oil prices—India   imports nearly 80%  of its fuel needs.
4442 2018-09-11 15:52:24 that oil money baby. Even JTru is captured. No coincidence that our 'frontier pioneering' oil giant nations do Native people and transportation/land use the way we do.
4443 2018-09-11 15:52:13 To 9-11 was an inside job...  #911 never forget how your own government murdered 30000 of its own people.. The "terrorist" were funded by the Saudi government.. Bin Laden took the fall.. All for oil and to invade 2 countries to start 20 year Wars and take away your rights.....
4444 2018-09-11 15:52:11 @narendramodi why we are not trying to explore oil in sea area which is in our control.
4445 2018-09-11 15:52:11 How can u stand with common people as bocz of us and with our money you all are taking all the benefits of tax free and allowance and are touring various places in the car. We pay for your petrol cars and airlines oil.

4462 2018-09-11 15:50:32 Toxic Filipino culture is having relatives who have the gall to feel na pinagdadamutan mo sila dahil wala ka nang mailabas na pera. Ni hindi nga ko makabili ng cleansing oil ko dahil lumagpas na ko sa alloted budget ko. And for me to put budget over skincare? That’s saying a lot.

4465 2018-09-11 15:50:18 The problem is, the government wants the enemy's oil.

Why do you think the Deep State throws a fit about @realDonaldTrump working to revitalize the coal industry and his push to use shale over petroleum?

Had a lever under the steering wheel - clutch in, pull lever & *everything* was disengaged & engine just idled.

4478 2018-09-11 15:49:09 Notwithstanding the slight rise in the price of a barrel of oil which is around 78 US dollars, the oil economy stagnates on average in Gabon, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo and Chad.
4479 2018-09-11 15:49:08 I had it switched my b, I was thinking of the density demonstration I saw in chem and got it switched, but water can’t be wet with oil if it sits on top of the water man.

The sector's contribution to the growth of the States of the sub-region is estimated this year at 1.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) against 1% for the oil sector, says the financial institution.
4484 2018-09-11 15:48:37 The export of crude oil is the one being piloted not the actual production.

4500 2018-09-11 15:47:28 Obama's divisiveness was more damaging than Trump.
Obama's economic policies (taxes, Obamacare, no drilling for oil) and higher restrictions on coal, even people's use of their own land & water, were much more damaging to our country than Trump could ever be.

4506 2018-09-11 15:47:00 It’s hard to follow —the guy just knows so much and, well, my ideas about the region are either miscellaneous fragments or stereotypes. Did you know Saudi Arabia is running out of both oil & money? I didn’t. That their credit line is running out? That they are after Yemen’s oil?
4507 2018-09-11 15:46:49 I think the only feasible solution to bring the price of fuels down is to bring (crude oil) under GST system and GST rate should be economical. #MehangiPadiModiSarkar
4508 2018-09-11 15:46:40 That is an issue, but I am betting the algae oil is cheaper then $1,500 billion for the F-35 ?  Let alone the rest of the monetary blackhole of the MIL_Indust_Complex.
The algae oil can be processed using existing oil Infrastructure, its like veggie oil.
4509 2018-09-11 15:46:40 The first words out of trumps mouth had nothing to do with the fact that today is the memorial to 9/11....so far not a soul has mentioned it here.  3,000 human beings murdered by the advocates of the people who sell us oil!

4551 2018-09-11 15:43:23 I'm not sure how it came up in conversation, but macassar was a type of hair oil that used to be popular, hence the use of antimacassars to save furniture.
I never knew that. Well, until I did.

4568 2018-09-11 15:42:09 Women no doubt are being marginalized. It just go with the saying that when a finger dipped an oil,it reaches the other.

4599 2018-09-11 15:39:58 Tbh I see it more as a tactic the government uses to make sure racism against Muslims stays prominent in the US so that people won't start opposing the oil war in the Middle East.

4605 2018-09-11 15:39:08 Interesting, did he say why oil majors have an interest in presenting a sunny picture of availability?
4606 2018-09-11 15:39:03 you will be responsible for destruction to environment... air pollution, ground destruction from drilling oil, spills etc, animal declining because habitats are destroyed, weather changing- volcano erupting, tsunami, glassier melting, erosion of coastlines w ocean rising.

Lagos was not built by monthly oil revenue allocation, Lagos had a long history of structural and economic development right from the time of Benin Kingdom, then the Portuguese, then colonial masters, then post independence era.

4612 2018-09-11 15:38:48 Please reduce oil prices. BJP will lose seats. 12 times excise duty increased. Not fair. Either shoukd bring under GST or reduce excise Rs5 atleast. Govt shoukd no declare war on people
4613 2018-09-11 15:38:47 It is refreshing to know that Indian govt. earns more than the oil producing countries by selling their oil to Indians.

4619 2018-09-11 15:37:58 correction. The oil and gas industry is the most heavily subsidized. There fixed it for you ... and there is a reason they haven't had a vote for the union yet. They'd LOSE and they know it. So they keep whining hoping rubes like you will believe them. The workers DON'T

4626 2018-09-11 15:36:32 Никак, просто если смотреть критически, то можно понять, что все пункты тупо подходят под большинство людей. Особенно пункт: очень любят впадать в ностальгию.
Ностальгия — чувство нахлынувшее от приятных воспоминаний в прошлом. Вопрос: а кто НЕ любит вспоминать ХОРОШЕЕ о ПРОШЛОМ.

4633 2018-09-11 15:36:06 Conspiracy theorists can alter their videos just as easy as the media can. I could care less if you think we actually killed thousands of innocent people for oil, but today you need to respect the lives lost

4643 2018-09-11 15:35:29 The surprise twist being that even though the coffee is north of $5 a cup, it tastes like motor oil filtered through a dirty sock.  And the barista is M. Night Shyamalan.  And he's been dead the whole time.
4644 2018-09-11 15:35:29 Sure, anything is possible. But I suspect #QAnon's either a troll or a psyop. If you follow the money it leads you to the traditional Deep State of Oil-Defense-Wall St & the GOP Establishment. I believe it's likely that they're "pulling the strings" & QAnon is pulling your chain.

4647 2018-09-11 15:35:19 Russia specifically targets fracking in the US/UK. It's a blatant effort to control competition for their oil/gas.

4685 2018-09-11 15:30:58 I hear a lot of Liberals claim the age of oil is over. But renewables are not ready or even capable of replacing oil, at least not yet.
Assuming 2038 is correct this is 20 more years of growth. 
But out government seems hell-bent on killing that industry. Why?

4737 2018-09-11 15:26:23 You forgot to mention American complicity in creating the context. Abusive foreign policy, the exploitation of countries with natural resources like natural gas and oil. The attack did not happen in a vacuum.

4741 2018-09-11 15:25:43 Well, Ludwig was right, it needed lotion, not baby oil. I tried to wait to get the lotion he prescribed, but it was expensive and I had to pay for that car, finally bought a $2 cocobutter lotion, it is healing. Not what was prescribed, but I had to do something.
4742 2018-09-11 15:25:32 And yes banks, oil companies, the FDA do play have a heavy influence on economics, politics, etc. But. Who is in control of those businesses/departments? Its not the American government.

4774 2018-09-11 15:22:13 after 7 years owning a M3 is about on par with owning a Civic ... the initial cost is mitigated by the reduced cost of fuel and service over those years.

4819 2018-09-11 15:17:56 The funny thing is we burn a cubic mile of oil every year, and so "production rates" will always be the limiting factor for bio-anything. Energy from the sun now has to compete with millions of years of dense stored solar energy. Its not a fair fight.

4826 2018-09-11 15:17:20 I have an oil leak. I had a senior moment and overfilled trying to top it off, and I had to drain and start over. This meant I had the car up on ramps, and was under it for a bit. 

Protip: you are not visible under your car, but shopping carts are readily available barriers.

4881 2018-09-11 15:12:01 No thanks, Explore Offshore! I resent giving up our sacred ground in heretofore protected places so the big oil industries can thrive. What I see is a great deal of GREED masked in “aw shucks, we’re doing it for the betterment of the people” doubletalk.

4896 2018-09-11 15:10:45 Jatropha curcas is a flowering plant species, which is native to American tropics, most likely Mexico and Central America.

We all watched the news. I recall the adults were afraid a plane could be headed to Chicago or our local oil refineries
4925 2018-09-11 15:08:50 War against Afghanistan was justified because that's where bin Laden had his training camp. War against Iraq was so that Cheney could take the Iraqi oil contracts away from Russians & French who got them by paying kickbacks which American firms not allowed to do.

4938 2018-09-11 15:08:02 If you were well informed, you will realise that Putin got involved because Obama was sponsoring Isis as well the rebel groups. Just so they could take the syria's oil for free. The Kurdish family in Turkey facilitated this and the Russians made videos and sat pics to prove it.
4939 2018-09-11 15:07:50 Why attack Afghanistan who had no oil? Because the Taliban, pursuant to their religion, was destroying the poppy fields that the C_A relied upon for their heroin trade.

4995 2018-09-11 15:04:03 The US intends to inflict as much pain as possible on the people of Venezuela because of their fruit cake leadership. Like a bully picking on a disabled child. When the country collapses the US will take the oil, as they did in Iraq. The demonising begins.

5097 2018-09-11 14:56:08 In a round about way Que and Ont get money that Albertans help put in refuse to accept development of AB O&G sector then turn around pay for foreign oil for use in their provinces. That isnt how a unified country is supposed to operate.
5098 2018-09-11 14:56:06 @dpradhanbjp Sir I hope India is in touch with  Venezuela to buy Cruda Oil, since their Inflation are in 1000s of percentage 

Good chance for India to buy cheap Crude

5099 2018-09-11 14:55:55 It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. By the sounds of it, Sekera may not be out for the entire season, which makes the LTIR angle a non-starter.

5101 2018-09-11 14:55:47 So I’m at the Hyundai dealership due for my first oil change and I’ve come to the conclusion that a lot of old people drive Hyundai’s because that’s all that i see in the waiting area 
5102 2018-09-11 14:55:40 A truly prolific blocker is Gerry Butts, a touchy chap when you expose his nefarious exploits in the ruin of canada.  One must also never mention his sizable World Wildlife fund severance payout to this anti-CDN, oil hating progressive

5113 2018-09-11 14:54:23 15 of the 19 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, why are we still buying their oil.
5114 2018-09-11 14:54:22 Thanks, I recently ordered 5 terpenes & they'll arrive this week.  I'm beyond excited to incorporate them into the CBD oil. Carefully of course!
5115 2018-09-11 14:54:18 I think the idea was that Scotland would Finance England's debts which had resulted from the various continental wars they were embroiled in. Still happening today too through Scottish oil revenue.
5116 2018-09-11 14:54:16 One got the money. Other got the oil and magical hands. So polygamy is the best compromise.

5118 2018-09-11 14:54:10 A visit to Castellina included a taste of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Mmmmm.

5121 2018-09-11 14:53:33 Moisturize those lips! 
Lips dry out faster due to fewer oil glands.

5122 2018-09-11 14:53:32 Also please share the price of crude oil during the same time.  It went as high as US$ 100 per barrel during UPA time and got reduced to about US$ 35 per barrel during NDA time. The price increase was mostly absorbed by govt. but price decrease was not passed onto the customers

5125 2018-09-11 14:53:04 Thank you! Since humankind is clearly not wise enough for now , I fear it discovered oil and nuclear power too soon for its own safety.
5126 2018-09-11 14:53:00 Also get yourself some beard oil.
5127 2018-09-11 14:52:59 Please read my comment again, two fluke titles THEN oil money titles.
5128 2018-09-11 14:52:54 that’s oil queen
5129 2018-09-11 14:52:54 You mean the ones that lost their lives in Iraq, where ZERO hijackers originated? I think about them everyday and about how a horrible president and his party used 9/11 as an excuse to steal Iraqi oil. I will never forget no matter how much candy Bush gives out to Michelle Obama.
5130 2018-09-11 14:52:48 We drinkin vegetable oil and eating glue sticks
5131 2018-09-11 14:52:46 Are you still at Hillary’s emails & Obama’s massive mistake of not damming Putin’s push to grab whatever he desires - which was initially a drive to control oil prices that really sunk also because US stepped up domestic O&G production? Blame Obama for depleting Russia’s coffers?
5132 2018-09-11 14:52:45 Got motor oil all over me!
5133 2018-09-11 14:52:40 Shea butter or a drop of vitamin E oil

5136 2018-09-11 14:52:16 Yeah. I developed a crush on Peter Jennings (I know, another abuser) when he derided a reporter for saying that 'no blood for oil' was just a vapid chant that didn't really mean anything. But those protests were great. My roomie's sign: 'Another bisexual mulatto for peace.'
5137 2018-09-11 14:52:15 I go for oil sa noo gamitin hahahajk
5138 2018-09-11 14:52:15 I'm from Detroit!! We have classic cars. They don't leak oil, if they did my husband would loose his.mind!! Lol!! Now if your just talking about a pos car that spews black smoke and is a total eye soar then Yes I agree.

5143 2018-09-11 14:51:48 What’s more insane is compared to AB’s royalty structure, Norway’s royalty rates are insanely high yet foreign oil corps still flock there. ABns have been bamboozled for decades by corrupted provincial politicians & oil corps on the lie of “only near zero% royalties work. #ableg
5144 2018-09-11 14:51:41 Given the oil price that's maybe more accurate. Still some deals especially in the jr's!
5145 2018-09-11 14:51:38 Oil price. May factor din ang peso contra dollar kaya ganyan nilobo ng price ng oil. Nawawalan ng halaga peso.

With few goods to export & a rapidly increasing import bill (for oil & cars) who wud buy or invest in NC if not attached to IC?
5148 2018-09-11 14:51:26 @ThanthiTV whatever tax reduction on fuel will result in higher profits of oil cos which in turn will attract incometax and also dividends.the oil co will also invest prudentially.
5149 2018-09-11 14:51:25 CBD oil has saved my life tbh
5150 2018-09-11 14:51:16 Being in my house with no power, flashlights and oil lamps. My parents ran water in the tubs before hand in case we didn’t have water. And sitting in our living for a couple of days

5152 2018-09-11 14:50:57 In my view, Oil Bond issued to oil companies by UPA at fixed return to control fuel price rise should be win win for all.. consumers, oil companies, Govt chequer. @mkvenu1

5157 2018-09-11 14:50:40 @ChristiCraddick's ties to the gas & oil industry shouldn't be dismissed.

5159 2018-09-11 14:50:15 Completely agree. What you propose would be an excellent project to quantitatively deduce whether it’s the numerics or MP that result in TC track improvement. Just throwing out my thoughts on twitter doesn’t pass the snake oil test until it’s systematically studied

5182 2018-09-11 14:47:23 What I find ironic about all this is that Jamie Oliver is overweight and his recipes aren’t healthy at all. You seen how much oil and butter that man uses!!? 
5183 2018-09-11 14:47:23 Dubbin is the dogs but a lot of them are made with tallow and fish oil. I think Nikwax is synthetic.
5184 2018-09-11 14:47:23 Just used my CBD oil to take my birth control. Am I doing this biohacking thing right?!
5185 2018-09-11 14:47:13 Most world oil prices are rallying, but Canada is an exception. Heavy sour (WCS) blend now at $29 bbl under WTI and $39 bbl under Brent. Light sweet (WSW)  crude at $17.25 bbl under WTI and $27.25 bbl under Brent.
5186 2018-09-11 14:47:10 And therein lies the issue. You could also do it with regionalised hydrocarbon oil duties, which is better but might have the bizarre side effect of people driving miles to get cheaper petrol. A better approach is an across the board duty cut.
5187 2018-09-11 14:47:09 I know, is just a backward looking idea, what's done can't be undone. Just to point out maybe US priorities are off. US have more harvestable energy in its own territory than can ever be able to use. No need to cause harm elsewhere. Plus all the money spent on oil can go to...
5188 2018-09-11 14:47:05 The B25 had gasoline fuel. (highly explosive)
 NOT JET A which is basically home heating oil. Nor did the 9/11 planes have bombs.The bombs were already in the building. Yea Im not sure if they used asbestos 4the Empire State But the WTC was loaded w it
5189 2018-09-11 14:47:03 US + EU sanctioning socialist countries that don't want US oil companies on their land, taking away all the wealth.

5203 2018-09-11 14:46:07 I used to pour oil into a burning fire, but now I’ve learnt how to put out a fire. LOLZZZZ times have changed.
5204 2018-09-11 14:45:54 Most of the terrorists were from Saudi Arabia. The oil is too sweet to bomb them.

5206 2018-09-11 14:45:46 Everyone came together too. We became one family that stood side by side. I remember when those oil fields went up overseas. We thought  that was a response.
5207 2018-09-11 14:45:38 so they turn to incite violence and read altright oil rags like rebel media to support inciting of violence and politicians like scheer who lie. fox news and toronto sun. brilliant. many ask main stream to get it right instead of buying into lying divisive media and politicians.
5208 2018-09-11 14:45:36 I live in Toronto,Canada. An oil producing country,still petrol (gas) price is $1.35/Lt which translates to 72.9 inr as of today(conversion rate 54).If u do a little brain storming, u will realise prices of petrol r way under control in India.
5209 2018-09-11 14:45:21 The product?

Olive oil.

Selo olive oil.

I have a Lamborghini.
5210 2018-09-11 14:45:15 A new oilsands project is going on in northern Alberta they are making crude oil and stuff like that. I thought the oil industry was done.
5211 2018-09-11 14:45:15 Sir Oil prices are increasing and causing discomfort for people. Government needs to take some action on this.

@ 20 litres/car; 5 litres/ 2-wheelers 
Commercial vehicles to be supplied only in the tanks. 
Please think on the option. 
It will minimise misuse of oil; reduce pollution & save traffic from getting jammed.

5231 2018-09-11 14:43:23 Sir completely agree. To switch from oil vehicle we need affordable option for people also. We have very few options, high prices, also charging stations are not even in infant stage. Sincerely hope that this will be priority till 2024,  confident you will be in  power till 2024.

5253 2018-09-11 14:39:54 The Government (both Central & states) shamelessly wastes 1000s of crores of tax payer money to run worthless PSUs & taxes the oil sector highly to finance this nonsense. No one has the political courage to privatise a single PSU to halt this wastage. Shame.
5254 2018-09-11 14:39:54 We have not taken over the oil fields in the MIddle East. Get off this stupid conspiracy theory. Watch the Discovery Channels documentaries on how & why the Twin Towers and other blogs collapsed. You need to take physics classes again.

Iraq & Afghanistan had more to do with oil & the military industrial complex.

5313 2018-09-11 14:34:31 The 9/11 narrative was a fabrication and attack truly carried out by the joint work of high ranking US govt, banksters, big pharma, oil industry, and gun MFG aimed at destabilizing an entire region of countries, ridding them of natural resources, and installing centralized banks.
5314 2018-09-11 14:34:26 Crude oil drops but petrol & diesel prices keep going up- can the Central govt give us a proper answer or atleast take a leaf of CM @ncbn’s book and do what he did—take a decision n reduce the price on VAT! #Rs2DownInAP

Move in the USA /France/UK companies to exploit them and control the Markets ITS MONEY AGAIN  ! the common denominator
5365 2018-09-11 14:27:59 That's all relative. Where is the research done, is the lab well known, do they use pesticides, is it GMO free? That doesn't mean organic or vise vera. It's a plant, you are still treating it like a drug. It it was oil or diamonds, then the purity might be an issue.
5366 2018-09-11 14:27:57 #Obama nice taking credit for economy. Just like you took credit for increased oil and gas production while fighting its production tooth and nail. You are always funny.

5369 2018-09-11 14:27:32 Indeed. A good quality shaving soap comes highly recommended too. I use Proraso, but Taylor of Old Bond St is more luxurious. Try a preshave oil too to minimize burn.,
5370 2018-09-11 14:27:30 The oil companies created a disinformation campaign. They’re the ones grabbing your money.
5371 2018-09-11 14:27:26 brought a stinky tomato salad with garlic and olive oil for lunch and the oil leaked out all over my lunchbox and the rest of my lunch. while cleaning the lunch box my hands absorbed the garlic smell and i'm already ready to call it a week.
5372 2018-09-11 14:27:22 Just made pumpkin seed cinnamon crisp bread. It's really easy to make, just takes some time. You need to mix 3 dl pumkin seeds, 1/2 dl flaxseeds, 2 dl corn flour, 1 tsp sea salt and 2 tsp ground cinnamon. Add 2 dl boiling water and 1/2 dl canola oil. Mix well and let cool.
5373 2018-09-11 14:27:22 it shouldn’t be this hard to get an oil change but life is never easy on me that’s for sure

5396 2018-09-11 14:25:24 The lady in the (very nice looking) porsche next to me at the walmart parking lot was not amused by my emergency parking lot oil change shenanigans.
5397 2018-09-11 14:25:20 Plus, it implies other groups like the "right" CAN "handle" national secuirty. When, of course, reality showed us that the Right only sought blood & oil with unending war.
5398 2018-09-11 14:25:18 in through “big oil.” It is quite a stretch to believe that all climate scientists are in on a secret hoax, but none have sold out their comrades in exchange for the actual fame and fortune that would bring. That is just crazy.

5414 2018-09-11 14:24:02 2,977 Americans imminently died in 9/11, around 5,000 in Iraq and another 2,400 in Afghanistan. Over a million Iraqis, Afghans and Libyans sadly perished too in these senseless wars but it should be known that these aren't wars for oil but for a hostile foreign genocidal state

@SJosephBurns
5453 2018-09-11 14:19:53 Since the time Modi Ji took over as the PM, the govt has paid over 2 lac cr in oil bonds.  
Also, they earned over 9 lac cr in taxes and duties for the same period!!!? 
5454 2018-09-11 14:19:44 Hawuuuuuthatha u cooking oil
5455 2018-09-11 14:19:35 9/11 was a false flag attack by the American government to trick the country into endless military support to go steal more oil/power from certain countries... yet you’ll will get mad at this tweet, not the murdering criminal enterprise that is America #OpenYourEyes #September11
5456 2018-09-11 14:19:29 2. Central govt earned Rs 8,00,000 cr excise duty from May 2014. 37% of excise duty went to state exchequer.( Rs 3,00,000 cr ).  Balance Rs 5,00,000 cr. Minus - oil bond Rs 2,00,000 cr.  
So central govt earned  only Rs 3,00,000 crore extra from petroleum product in 4 years.

5463 2018-09-11 14:19:01 I'm going to get the piss ripped out of me for this but here goes.  Crinkle cut fries have a higher surface area to mass ratio meaning that they have more exposure to cooking oil.  Crispier, fattier, hence tastier.
5464 2018-09-11 14:18:55 Almost halfway with this 36X36 oil painting.
5465 2018-09-11 14:18:51 Now it's time for the nation to have quite strong negotiated deals with crude oil suppliers and have proper stock and storage to have ample time to negotiate for quality deals every now and then to bargain best rates

5471 2018-09-11 14:18:20 Coining a new term here: #Petrofragility to describe the sentiment that the whole economy will collapse when oil companies only get 97% of what they want.
5472 2018-09-11 14:18:13 The US decision is based on the administration's hatred for people of color and the age-old misguided belief that propping up Israel will help the USA control Middle East oil.
5473 2018-09-11 14:18:09 I can bet you have also only absorbed sources from one side of the argument and completely oblivious to every attempt made by the U.S. to ensure Venezuela fails since it is sitting on THR LARGEST OIL DEPOSIT IN THE WORLD!

5511 2018-09-11 14:13:45 Nikki Haley knows they are after the Oil and could care less about the Syrian people. Why won't they let Syria remove the last Terrorists ? Because they funded them and would be unable to pressure Assad for a pipeline.
5512 2018-09-11 14:13:44 Poison our water, Poison our air, poison our land...kill off future generations cause they can't breathe, eat or drink clean water. Instead lets build renewable, hemp, wind, solar, battery etc. Where is your leadership, why are you shilling for the oil industry as the world burns
5513 2018-09-11 14:13:43 RSPO is an accreditation run by the palm oil industry. It’s not likely to be very rigorous? Self regulation isn’t a strong point of big agribusiness

5516 2018-09-11 14:13:20 Again u r missing the point or u don't want to see the point. How @narendramodi & his govt looted the public by taxing us heavily even when the oil prices crashed & is yet to reach those dizzying heights!
5517 2018-09-11 14:13:06 Why recycle debunked misinformation?

That video references VOC's from condensate and oil storage tanks used primarily in conventional production in Colorado that resulted in higher methane readings still safe for human health but representing a ghg issue.  Regs since changed.

5544 2018-09-11 14:10:01 The petrodollar is responsible for more war, lobbyists for the 1%, and bad foreign policy than any other industry. The US military industrial complex is one of big oil’s best customers if not best. The money trail argument on big oils behalf falls apart.
5545 2018-09-11 14:09:59 That’s not true. Planned Parenthood is a women’s health clinic which provides many services. I’m beginning to believe ‘morality’ is a code word for controlling nutjobs. Stop with the hate. Btw, if men got pregnant, there would be abortion pit stops at every oil change center!

The points about CO2 are relevant and can be discussed, but honestly, it makes more sense that “big oil” pays scientists to SCHILL, Shill, shil, more so than the accusing climate scientists of that.

5640 2018-09-11 13:59:21 It’s sad that the American government killed those people, Sacrificed the lives lost on that day just so they can invade another country for oil and power. So they can finance their plan to control the world.

5643 2018-09-11 13:59:05 As we are happy for this moment Mr President we are calling on you to as a matter of concern to review downward  the exchange rate to atleast N200 to $1, since crude oil now is not sold for $30 per barrel and the daily production is not 600,000 barrels per day.
5644 2018-09-11 13:59:02 How many oil/gas cos have foreign tax rates > 13.125 or even > 21?
5645 2018-09-11 13:58:55 Today is also a day to remember the 100,000+ civilian casualties in the Iraq War who died because our government used an attack as a means to invade an unrelated country to gain access to oil. Respect and love to all innocent lives lost starting on September 11th 2001.

5664 2018-09-11 13:56:54 We should ramp up production because heavy crude oil production is declining (cf. Venezuela) and demand is growing (cf. crude oil to petchem tech). Um, you're seriously suggesting Canada might turn out like Venezuela? Also, USA produces light sweet, we produce heavy.

5670 2018-09-11 13:56:11 So do I. I prefer to buy it super firm and already cubed (better for the busy dad). Then I toss it in some seasoning (always with some cayenne) and just enough flour to give it a little crunch when I fry it in as little oil as possible. Usually make my own chili honey sauce. So?

5677 2018-09-11 13:55:33 17 years ago I was on an oil platform in Alaska, had just gone into a break room to have a cigarette.

The news was on, the first Tower was smoking, then I watched the second tower get hit, my heart broke. God Bless the souls lost that day! 

I quit smoking that night!
5678 2018-09-11 13:55:32 So Scotland's Hazard and England's Abramovich?

Abramovich made his money in oil didn't he?

5682 2018-09-11 13:55:15 Good read. I have an oil-based system and I'm desperate to switch to an air source heat pump but I have to invest in energy efficiency first. I hadn't come across the hybrid concept before but I guess this would not work with oil? @mikehemsley
5683 2018-09-11 13:55:15 It's easier to imagine the disaster that all that mining for coal, gas, and oil cause because we see it every day.
5684 2018-09-11 13:55:14 I have eczema too.. hot showers and most soaps make eczema worse. I take luke warm to cool showers and use more natural soaps and lotions. Fractionated coconut oil helps too, especially after a shower.
5685 2018-09-11 13:55:13 You mean the heroes that invaded two irrelevant countries to take oil and slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians?
5686 2018-09-11 13:55:13 Blair was a Tory I’ve heard it all. Wow . Yh ofc nobody wants the uk to strike Syria and the government will only interfere with these countries with a agenda ie) Iraq/Afghan for its oil.
5687 2018-09-11 13:55:09 True and disgusting
5688 2018-09-11 13:55:04 It’s downtown you paying for the location, I’m basically paying for a view that’s all. The price not bad seeing all of the space that I’m getting, plus I don’t have to drive so I’m saving on gas and oil changes
5689 2018-09-11 13:55:02 The GOP gave huge tax cuts to industry OWNERS.
METHANE is a killer, a SUPER GREENHOUSE GAS that belches from oil drilling.
Instead of INVESTING to keep METHANE under control, they are pleading it's too costly to KEEP CLEAN AIR FOR KIDS.
INVEST TAX CUT IN ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY.
5690 2018-09-11 13:55:01 Our Ambassador had dirt on HC! Why'd she kill Gaddafi eventough he was doing everything we asked? I guarantee it was  for HC & Obama! Probably about oil! Your Dad @realDonaldTrump must take control of DOJ/FBI very soon, or his base will lose hope!

5693 2018-09-11 13:54:54 The use of medicinal cannabis isn’t just about smoking. CBD oil, topical cream, not just medical marijuana- just have strong anti inflammatory and neuroprotectant properties. It’s about wellness overall and pain relief.
5694 2018-09-11 13:54:48 @realDonaldTrump 17 years since the US murdered thousands of it's own citizens as a pretext to invade the middle east to gain control of the oil reserves in the region

5699 2018-09-11 13:54:30 Surprising to me that Democrats and the press have not pounced on exception to GILTI (a sort of minimum tax on foreign profits) for U.S. oil and gas multinationals.
5700 2018-09-11 13:54:26 Check engine light came on in the car. Ugh
I was supposed to be getting an oil change with this paycheck Gods I hope it's not more I just can't
5701 2018-09-11 13:54:22 Of course the peak oil demand is debatable...will it be 2030 or 2036 or 2040? Suncor thinks 2038, for what it's worth. But no one thinks oil demand will keep growing past the mid-2040s. The real question is, what does the decline curve look like? Cf. Wood Mac.
5702 2018-09-11 13:54:21 Adulting is when you’re cleaning out your car and find a full bottle of oil under your car seat, and feeling like you’ve reached the peak of success. I’m excited af to change my oil right now

5736 2018-09-11 13:50:20 There was no oil left in 2014 apparently and late 2014 early 2015 there was 2 or 3 massive finds. Now there’s a possibility that there will be another indyref there appears to be more doom and gloom. Im sure it will pick up after again.

Keep the oil of true leadership flowing ma.

Dems are butt hurt because they can't get their illegal and dead friends to vote... Those illegal votes cancel the votes of Americans in minority communities...In essence its a rigging!
5765 2018-09-11 13:48:11 Literally everything I cook includes olive oil #Italianproblems
5766 2018-09-11 13:48:07 Hey moocher, maybe you can be a small benefit to society today. How much oil goes into the primary chain case in a 93 heratige softail?
5767 2018-09-11 13:48:04 If it's any consolation I do like olive oil

5774 2018-09-11 13:47:29 I just wanna go to the oil fields already
5775 2018-09-11 13:47:28 I disagree. They’re worse. The reform committee got nothing of significance. They’re taking oil money again. They’re voting with trump on multiple SERIOUS issues. And they’re making new rules saying Perez gets to decide who runs based on party loyalty. They’re MUCH worse.
5776 2018-09-11 13:47:26 Unlike you, I've actually spent very little time thinking about who did it. I know who did it. I think of the victims, the survivors, the heros near and far. 
We all know WHO did it. 
And they're still not on the ban list.
Oil > lives???
5777 2018-09-11 13:47:26 Opposition is citing common man as the worst hit on rising oil prices but they should know governments of the day in India are spending roughly 20% of GDP on the same common man. It amounts to several lakhs of ₹. From where they can get that money? Taxes paid on oil. Can't we?

5779 2018-09-11 13:47:13 They’re also doing a major give-away of mational lands/monuments to gas/oil companies right now
5780 2018-09-11 13:47:10 Nig Govt should have investors mass produce this nd also export to countries that use it especially places like India Nd other African countries and this just might improve the economic growth of the country thereby helping its GDP but no we want oil prices up so looters can gain
5781 2018-09-11 13:47:04 Think about how great America would ACTUALLY be if we weren’t spending BILLIONS of $ to steal oil from foreign nations . . . I mean “fight terrorism.” 
5782 2018-09-11 13:47:02 It's not them forcing you to value something. It's America forcing Saudis to only accept dollars for oil. It's Korea preventing capital outflows. It's Russia forcing banks to have a backdoor for Putin.

"men with guns" is just that fiat currency is backed by political capital.

5794 2018-09-11 13:45:51 The right step (basic):

AM: cleanser > Toner > moisturizer > sunscreen (i skip morning cleanser, dpeends masing2)

PM: cleanser oil base & water base > toner > moisturizer 

Toner i pakai 3layer, moisturizer i pakai amount yg selesa sbb T zone quite oily.

 Hurricane Chevron
 Hurricane Unical
 Hurricane British Petroleum
 Hurricane Shell Oil

5802 2018-09-11 13:45:24 Assuming that they dont earn any profit, there is huge scope to become an agile organization. Most of these PSUs are are fat, lazy and slow. And if rationalization of oil price should also entail rationalization of govt doing biz via OMCs. Let market decides.
5803 2018-09-11 13:45:23 One is clearly a TRUE patriot-Dustin. And one is NOT-AJ. Both have totally different motives. That is like trying to mix water and oil. Know your enemy- as he seeks to destroy you. There isn’t merging good and evil. The battle lines have been drawn.

5807 2018-09-11 13:45:01 Really @vikasjournolko What does Indian electorate need to see is that they decreased the  % hike in oil prices ?? Hilarious..they even went a step ahead and increased the excise duty on crude oil when The price of oil in international market was low
5808 2018-09-11 13:45:00 Showing my age David! When I started as a mechanic oil and filter were 3000 miles spark plus 6000 miles.
Workshop manuals were stone tablets!!!
5809 2018-09-11 13:44:56 That said, the shells look super pale so I suspect they needed more time in the frier; if the oil was a cooler than 360 that could be a problem too. Liquid oils also don’t fry as crisp, so if it wasn’t coconut or shortening that would be a thing to consider as well.

5824 2018-09-11 13:43:19 Buttz, Buttz... have you checked the latest IEA numbers? Oil and gas based sources continue to grow. 

Side note: this means the Libs get an “F” on their climate plan. 

Clearly, whatever California is doing is not having an impact overall.
5825 2018-09-11 13:43:16 #NeverForget the lives lost on 9/11 and how our government set the whole thing up & then proceeded to cover it as terrorism to promote the war for oil.

5828 2018-09-11 13:43:02 ECB "money printing" failed to get inflation on target, oil price moved inflation up. There is no seed for next crisis in negative real rates. It's a complete bull. ECB never had tools to fight crisis, the tool box has been taken away from member states politicians in ez.

5832 2018-09-11 13:42:36 prices for low-caloric value Indonesian coal have tumbled since June, while oil prices have remained high. The country’s monthly trade deficit in July was its largest since 2013, largely due to expensive energy imports.

5844 2018-09-11 13:41:15 I cant think of President Bush and 911 without including how it was used to invade a country, end millions of lives and do so by lying to the American people. The WMD lies were used to privatize oil in Iraq. I cant think of one without including the other.
5845 2018-09-11 13:41:11 How funny. What type of graph it is. 80 is less than 71 & B.J.P. tell the half truth. In 2014 the international price of cruid oil is much high than 2018.
5846 2018-09-11 13:41:10 Reminder: bush did 9/11 to make Americans fear Muslims and justify wars for oil :-)

Norway 50%

5907 2018-09-11 13:36:16 A snake oil salesman at best. His grotesque followers applauded his calling deadly Benghazi a conspiracy theory, they thought he was cool as he shrugged his shouders and kept golfing as a journalist of our free press was being beheaded, then went to a fundraiser. Oh, humm
5908 2018-09-11 13:36:12 @realDonaldTrump Everyone knows I never make a mistake. I am sure that you will work for us because of our consolidation of power and global peace, so that by the end of November, Iran's oil exports will reach zero

5949 2018-09-11 13:31:58 . Ironic from a group fronted by Big Oil. It's been more than a CENTURY, yet oil continues to receive federal and state subsidies. It's high time OIL stands on its own. And by the way, #ethanol doesn't receive any federal incentives. Can you say the same?

5952 2018-09-11 13:31:51 -2 competition with Russia to supply the EU with oil and gas. Interestingly, oil and natural gas are the mainstays of Russian economy so this weakens their economy. Now, what were you saying again about Trump and Russia? I gave you my proof, where’s yours?

5957 2018-09-11 13:31:07 OK, but that doesn’t change the fact that your post made no sense. Mr Hassett and Mr Trump are cut from the same cloth. They are snake oil salesman and the fact that you don’t see a problem with someone saying that the Dow should be 36,000 in 1999 means you bought it.

5992 2018-09-11 13:27:35 If something of yours hasn’t been disposed of properly ends up all over public space, then yes it is littering. And also, can’t really blame it on nature?  It’s like blaming the ocean for spreading an oil spill further than the initial site of spill.

6009 2018-09-11 13:24:50 On point 1, weekly revision or daily revision is not relevant when we compare 5 years of horizon. Also even the current government controls the oil price, ex. Oil Price didn’t increase for 2 weeks before Karnataka election despite 3-4$ rise in crude

6013 2018-09-11 13:24:21 Just because we aren’t drilling doesn’t mean they aren’t producing oil.
6014 2018-09-11 13:24:15 Okay so now that oil is fairly flowing and cheaper........maybe we should start drilling for black printer ink.
6015 2018-09-11 13:24:13 Don’t we have sanctions & a trade embargo against Venezuela? I think their economic problems started once we implemented these policies? But what do I know? I think we have enough oil of our own now , we might want to cut them some slack. Maybe Yemen too? Just saying..

6017 2018-09-11 13:23:56 That the Kimmeridge flowed at Lidsey was a big deal. The next update post HH, post Balcombe, post Brockham from the advisers will likely have a much larger estimate of oil in place in the Weald and a greater recoverable factor. All in due time.

Trump gets all the credit because some have a short memory and won't give a black man credit at all.
6027 2018-09-11 13:22:41 Y'all want to remember 9/11 every year, but we gotta forget the school shootings, USA destroying the Middle East for decades (all for oil), and Trump worsening the situation in Palestine/Israel.

6040 2018-09-11 13:21:17 Dear @RSPO tweets, I am outraged to hear that you continue to credit #palmoil villain, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner, @Indofood by certifying them. That’s not sustainable palm oil, suspend them now.

6045 2018-09-11 13:21:01 Only stupid ones. It's a simple buy messy task and if you have it done at a shop they properly dispose of (recycle) the old oil.
6046 2018-09-11 13:21:00 There are both oil and gas projects in Quebec. For oil there are a number of exploration projects.  Anticosti has a resource assignment.  There is also a discovery in the Gaspe with a reserves and resource assignment by independent engineers.

6056 2018-09-11 13:20:15 For me what is important is that a fair transition from oil and gas to renewables is achieved, irrespective of #BrexitShambles. This isn’t really to do with Brexit, it has to happen anyway, the question is how.

6097 2018-09-11 13:15:43 Given Qatar (tiny population / natural gas) and Canada (relatively small population / oil sands) I'd guess this was worked out on some per-capita / fossil-fuel/energy usage basis? But it's pretty unclear

6099 2018-09-11 13:15:40 Market cap is not relevant as I believe majority of people will prefer to hold XRP rather than spending it. Do count the supply of barrels of oil that most countries hold and times it with current oil price you’ll be surprised with the cap size. Long horizon not EOY silly thingy.

6119 2018-09-11 13:13:57 So because crude oil is no more $100 per barrel, Nigerians should suffer & be poor?  
Should crude oil be the only means foreign earnings to a large country like Nigeria?
In 2014 the creative art industry contributed about 1.42% to the GDP boosting it to 6.3%. Nigeria need PDP

6122 2018-09-11 13:13:24 Most people can't do that. Hell, my husband knows how to change the water heater but last time he went ahead and let the guys from Lowe's do it.
Even his comment that you should know how to change the oil is ridiculous. You need a level driveway and equipment to do that.

That the oil sits away from the soup and the soup sits away from the oil, like they are fighting,
The soup & oil are friends , so they shld  sit together

6199 2018-09-11 13:06:07 Problem is they (gov) are preparing to change law so 1. fracking will need the same planning permission as a garden shed ie none 2protest will be unlawful. So..not that simple and there is an issue re rules being changed 2 make it too easy to frack and difficult to oppose protest

6223 2018-09-11 13:03:42 Point of my initial tweet, of my entire point on CNY oil contract in fact, is the system IS mutating.  It is 5+ yrs into mutating; like boiling water, the move fr 33F to 211F yields no visible change - the move from 211F to 212F, a phase change from liquid to gas.

Why the media is not making hue and cry on the State Govts to reduce VAT on fuel. No one will do.
6302 2018-09-11 12:56:57 The one I hear the most is oil and destabilizing the region. The Iran contra was similar. One of the insiders said any country try’s to negotiate oil prices the get a regime/leader change, Look at  Venezuela
6303 2018-09-11 12:56:55 Better u go back to tv serials or else keep quite. After more than 4 yrs of yur party’s rule and apter spoiling life and good shape of country u have started blaming other party. What better u did? Look at oil and rupee. What external factors u talk about. Ceude is falling.
6304 2018-09-11 12:56:52 Heel right through the screen and into the innards. Was going to follow up with a joke about striking oil but felt it would be hypocritical of me.
6305 2018-09-11 12:56:50 Of course he is.  Pretty sure he's gotten some oil money here.
I hate his stupid ass.

6308 2018-09-11 12:56:32 I did that with my car once, squirting smoke machine oil onto the outlet manifold. They could only get so far before smoke would billow out from beneath the bonnet. Car was too crap to be stolen though. Infrasonic fields to scare them away in the house is my next project...

6313 2018-09-11 12:55:58 So cutting prices of oil by Rs 1 per litre, we should be preapred to hear the excuse that Government has no money cause of it. So state Government employees are not going to get DA much.
6314 2018-09-11 12:55:56 Nice false equivalency; it is all you have against an actual expert. lol Keep doing big oil's bidding, Matt. If they aren't paying you they should be. 
6315 2018-09-11 12:55:55 no doubt and the crude oil has exposed that so nakedly
6316 2018-09-11 12:55:43 Indeed, you have forgotten: allowing collusion with a foreign power. Compliments of the Bush administration the bin Laden family was loaded onto a plane to escape any form of responsibility following 9/11. Protecting big business, oil and $$$ at the expense of Americans.
6317 2018-09-11 12:55:34 Cadbury's chocolate is disgusting these days anyway.
Grainy, different texture, different sweetness, slight under-taste of coconut.... which I presume is coconut oil?
Wherever it comes from, its nasty.
Its now closer to the texture of 1970's Nestle chocolate....

Also, you know how they say everyone breaks under torture eventually? Unmanaged 8-10 pain is like that. People get desperate and that's how the snake oil sellers get us.

6344 2018-09-11 12:53:18 Plz calculate, oil bond was far good then rising prices? If money flows in hands of masses, revenue to exchequer is far higher then sucked by raising prices. Ten thousand cash paid pm for any purchase will fast rotates, contribute more on excise tax then fuel.

Oil, Media, Banks etc etc crowded out external scrutiny by theatrically funding scrutiny. These are businesses. This is marketing.

There's really no way to fill a loss this wide. GST might come, but States and Center will keep levying almost same amt of taxes under other names.
6566 2018-09-11 12:32:49 Remarkable! The WTO money tree was  down the back of the sofa for all this time, and we never thought to delve down earlier to reap these easy pickings until the divination of the ERG. Grab the snake oil while your down there.
6567 2018-09-11 12:32:47 Venezuela is an oil based economy. It's certainly never been my ideal.
6568 2018-09-11 12:32:39 I still wonder why Nigeria is still underdeveloped despite the fact that we have crude oil as our God given resources. The worst part of it is that they copied America's system of government yet things are not working.Nigeria would've developed if they restructure the system.

6570 2018-09-11 12:32:06 Iran has its oil & gas muscle plus, possibly nuclear & not a divided nation. Pak is bankrupt,which though brandishing its nukes is ready to fall apart internally with no semblance of democracy. So comparison untenable
6571 2018-09-11 12:32:06 They r worse than b4 the Americans arrived. Where r Sadams wepons of mass destruction, Y is Libya a broken state, Y r Afghanistan pple ruled by warlords n ISIS. Y is Saudi Arabia still standing yet their pple caused 911 I will tell you y. U need their oil n they agree2all u say
6572 2018-09-11 12:31:57 @narendramodi Please start a campaign to use less and less crude oil. Import of crude oil is the most dangerous for our economy. All problems will solve if the campaign of using less crude oil got successful .use less oil to build India strong.

6604 2018-09-11 12:28:08 Castor oil is a vegetable oil obtained by pressing the seeds of the castor oil plant.The common name "castor oil",from which the plant gets its name, probably comes from its use as a replacement for castoreum, a perfume base made from the dried perineal glands of the beaver.

6611 2018-09-11 12:27:14 I haven't explored that question, but it's likely that antinutrients in the extracted oil would be minimal, and even if there were significant antinutrient issues, the benefits of DHA would likely outweigh the risks. But I really don't know; just speculating.

6650 2018-09-11 12:22:47 Agree to this, plus try gently moving ( I remember  using coconut oil to aid the movement, cos it works well for my skin ) 
Another strategy is to make a small ring with cotton & then wet it slightly, so it expands. Keep overnight and repeat. This is recommended by my grandmom

6675 2018-09-11 12:20:30 95% of SA people are too scared to criticise KSA in case they get their head chopped off. A disgrace that countries like the US & UK support SA for oil & weapons.
6676 2018-09-11 12:20:29 nothing more patriotic than overthrowing governments and staging coups over oil and a grudge match with the ussr and then acting indignant when the ppl who live in those countries are thrust into turmoil and eventually lash out
6677 2018-09-11 12:20:26 I get it’s frustrating that when it rains “everyone forgets how to drive” but keep in mind that the first week or so of rain fall brings out all of the oil in the streets. That means people have to drive safer. If you’re that concerned then please leave earlier so you aren’t late
6678 2018-09-11 12:20:22 Well, I have sampled other brands that have the same ingredients and compared to them your nut butter is very 'watery' even when stirred properly.  Which either means you are padding the product out with extra oil or there's something wrong with the manufacturing process
6679 2018-09-11 12:20:21 1) the Solar/wind solution is still not “on demand” and it has an environmental footprint too. 3) when wind/solar make sense( fit need & break even or less) the masses will buy it. 3) Don’t pretend they can replace oil or coal. Sailing ships departed 150 yrs ago.

6699 2018-09-11 12:17:43 Lazy Govt, happy sharing. We all know this is the major binding force that makes the so called 'one Nigeria', feasible. One day, crude oil will surely cease from serving as a major economic commodity in the world. Then, everyone will come to his right sense.
6700 2018-09-11 12:17:41 CBD doesnt have thc in it, CBD oil can be used for a multiple things and unfortunately whoever told you that is wrong. Happy to answer any questions however :)

6702 2018-09-11 12:17:32 @BJP4India can u pls show that infograph with crude oil international prices??
6703 2018-09-11 12:17:27 It is another US made crisis.!
Don’t blame Maduro,
He is trying to keep oil incomes in the country for his own people.!
US must stop sanctions before innocents die from hunger.!

6708 2018-09-11 12:16:54 @VP and this is a great job for global peace. Yes, Iran's oil exports should be completely cut off by November 4th, so that we do not see the shame of this regime, so that this regime can never achieve a nuclear weapon, because if it is achieved,

6710 2018-09-11 12:16:29 The subsidy on oil is removed, what is your point, reduce prices and stop building highways and some other programs that uses the same money? the money is the same ; As long as Govt doesnt swindle and pocket, it is ok. Take AAPtard logic to congressis and vote for them in 2019
6711 2018-09-11 12:16:28 The day Americans murdered Americans so they could murder millions of others for oil..

6715 2018-09-11 12:16:01 Yep. So is social security, medicaid, oil subsidies, coal subsidies, bank and farm bailouts, public transportation, roads and highways, public schools, libraries, 911--Use any of these and you are a Socialist.
6716 2018-09-11 12:15:58 (blonde voice) "Like, I'm pretty sure those Curds are sitting on a couple trillion of oil."
6717 2018-09-11 12:15:57 The middle east 1 big shit hole. If they didn't have oil the world wouldn't give a second thought to that region. It's 2018 and the middle east still thinks it back 600 years ago.
6718 2018-09-11 12:15:56 PM says trains are not the best way to move oil, and says pipelines are the safest way. Re-iterates on doing it "right. I can understand the frustration and lashing out."

6721 2018-09-11 12:15:45 @VP If the price of oil reaches $ 100, with the full boycott of Iran's oil, it's still worth it. Of course, I do not think it will reach $ 100, but if it is temporary, the price of oil will go down, it's worth anyway, because the biggest supporter of terrorism will be destroyed,

6725 2018-09-11 12:15:22 Not trying to get Peter in trouble here but I’ve also been eager to find out. From what I can gather it’s just 500 cal/day of low starch salad with olive oil. I imagine it’s protein that you’d want to avoid eating (and carbs of course).

6727 2018-09-11 12:15:00 Methane is 25 times more damaging than carbon dioxide to our atmosphere as it traps heat so efficiently. The Trump administration just gutted EPA regulations on methane leaked and flared by the oil and gas industry, a giant step backward in efforts to combat climate change.

6732 2018-09-11 12:14:06 I just dropped and broke such an expensive bottle of olive oil at home. 

Honestly all I have to say is that I’m so glad I’ve never pulled a stunt like this in digs. 
6733 2018-09-11 12:13:57 and only norway has oil reserves, finland, sweden and denmark don’t they just have high taxes, string unions, and comorehensive social programs that work.
6734 2018-09-11 12:13:41 The west has literally encircled Russia with the NATO machine despite the "we will not move east by even 10 cm" reassurance at the end of the cold war. I am yet to understand the western insatiable greed for oil and gas. To what end?
6735 2018-09-11 12:13:31 Can the BJP spokesman please explain this graph, i.e, if he understands this spin. The only fact I know is that that petrol was <Rs. 80 when the crude oil ( input) was >$140/barrel and it is about Rs. 90/litre when crude oil is priced at $75/barrel.

6781 2018-09-11 12:08:11 That's the beauty of #capitalism - ignore externalities and dump the costs onto people and the environment. Without 'externalities' many corporations would go bust - all the oil companies for example.

6894 2018-09-11 11:56:12 Liberals would have saved us after the GFC by saying 'stop the boats', take bribes from coal, welfare for oil & gas corps, new laws attacking our freedoms & tax cuts for the rich. So yeah we would be fucked right now.

Roads to drive our vehicle, connectivity must but it leads to fragmented Forest
6914 2018-09-11 11:53:07 The problem is oil is quite unique. It is not used (much) in electricity, where coal / gas can be displaced by non-fossil. Oil is mainly transport (& petrochemicals), & we don't really have good solutions for long-term transport. So oil will find a "niche" for a while...
6915 2018-09-11 11:53:07 Yup. That was when I realized politics were more important than American lives. Too much Saudi oil in all of our cars.

6984 2018-09-11 11:46:22 Are you serious? You mean to say you increased the debts by selling petrol at lower price even when the crude oil prices were much dearer in the international market? Was this lack of trade knowledge or was this for appeasement?
6985 2018-09-11 11:46:20 I mean, I used to change my own oil, but now I have money for the places with holes in the floor or entire machines to pick up cars so I don't have to try to get my expanding body under the damn thing anymore

Don’t you agree Edward ?
6999 2018-09-11 11:44:47 Kindly compare the same with crude oil rate
7000 2018-09-11 11:44:47 BJP should have also created a huge oil pool deficit like Congress! Are you aware that Iran was on the verge of stopping supplies.
7001 2018-09-11 11:44:43 Good morrow, it's Olive Oil. You've been chewing over if after all these lustrums you'd like to slap a hoe.
7002 2018-09-11 11:44:37 I believe this is an oil lamp.
7003 2018-09-11 11:44:36 How about The Plastic Cup - clubs compete on the face of their balance sheets to see who can gain the most money from dodgy oil thieves and repressive medieval regimes. Idea is to financially wipe out small clubs and be last man standing. No fans or morals allowed.
7004 2018-09-11 11:44:35 @firmusenergy i like to see the usual dirty tactic used coming into winter..put gas prices up by 12% and blame oil prices..bollocks! Ya never put the prices up in the summer!
7005 2018-09-11 11:44:31 Good question! If we were serious about climate change it wouldn't be so hard to get paid for trying to something meaningful about it. As individuals and as a society we get what we pay for - and anyone who buys oil pays for the corporate voice. But who pays for the alternative?

7017 2018-09-11 11:43:34 Let's not purchase petrol or disel for 5 days in this month decide nation wide it will hamper both oil companies and states and central govt  Wether bjp or congress ruling this is the only option left

7019 2018-09-11 11:43:32 यह नहीं बताया जनाब कि उस वक्त crude oil का भाव अबसे दो गुना था। इस अधूरी जानकारी को, लोगों को मूर्ख बनाना समझा जाना चाहिए कि नहीं समझा जाना चाहिए २ ?
7020 2018-09-11 11:43:29 Will vote for BJP in 2019 even if Petrol is Rs. 200, $ is 100 and oil is $30 a barrel.

High Petrol prices will incentivize the Auto-Industry to go electric faster; and revenues from end-of-lifecycle fossil fuel will help accelerate government projects during transition.

7026 2018-09-11 11:42:44 Dear mam, with due respect, what will be your strategy in such situations where international market is bullish in crude oil prices?

7033 2018-09-11 11:41:43 Now Oil use is attached to international market, so nothing govt. can do. Petrol prices in UPA rule increase by 160% averaging 16% while in BJP rule it 13% in four years averaging 4% year.  I did break down for you so you can understand, I hope you know basic arithmetic.

Also BJP - refuses to cut duties on imported fuel.

7075 2018-09-11 11:35:53 The problem some set of taxes also change based on the what the estimated price of oil is. Leave politics aside. Oil taxes are calibrated to meet fiscal deficit goals, consumption targets and inflation.
7076 2018-09-11 11:35:36 I saw this on Sunday evening. Considered buying in but its pegged as a Stable Coin meaning it will always be equal to the dollar.  Inflation is imminent. The IMF has sacked the Dollar completely. OIL trade eliminated Petro dollar. A 40% inflation is coming. Did you grab some?

7240 2018-09-11 11:15:31 Also... Most of the time oil is purchased through the contract notes of these bonds and vested through a certain period rite? This is cycle... Every government does it... Does this govt buys outright with USD? May be they are buying with #gaumutra...

7251 2018-09-11 11:13:59 Sorry, but the economy was bad under Bush.  Under Obama it went sideways.  President Trump added fuel i.e. deregulations, tax cut,  more coals, more oil drilling, and no more fines for not having Obamacare. And much more.  Thank you President Trump!

7277 2018-09-11 11:10:47 I agree. If you're looking at modelling the price of an individual thing like oil, there is a lot of data out there to predict consumption, use, extraction costs and so on.

7348 2018-09-11 11:01:22 They are both orthogonal. Unless you are claiming a world where there is no private transportation.

Mass transit is already electrical. We need to move private transit to electrical and hedge against oil supply fluctuations.

7370 2018-09-11 10:57:59 Divert your attention to economic crisis plaguing people. Do something to control oil price hike, arrest inflation soaring inflation, solve rice shortage, nab peter lim, stop smuggling of shabu.

7394 2018-09-11 10:55:08 That's only source now. Extraction of pure oil then conversation to BD. Still long way to go in terms of engine for BD. Oil companies will be ready with BSVI fuel by 2021. But same can't be guaranteed for automobiles, but still hope is there. After 2021 dependence might go down
7395 2018-09-11 10:54:46 Well the thought itself is so naive and unconforming that of course they'd fall for the jive talking, snake oil salesman. These ppl are easy pickings, as always. Hence why now their leadership is a band of bozos and they still act mesmerized and starstruck.

7404 2018-09-11 10:53:38 I get that, and appreciate the consistently good content from stealth. In my mind one cannot value fuel in Rand and not take oil price into account.

7507 2018-09-11 10:37:52 That's the thing... they don't say and heavy oil is bad for your skin. Try mixing with coconut oil, you'll have clear skin *hopefully*  
It also damages hair, if you use shea butter alone then you've to rinse it off after some minutes, most naturals I know don't do this

7509 2018-09-11 10:37:39 Rupee is weak because USD is getting stronger by the day due to high growth in US economy on account of tariffs  and oil is rising bcoz of sanctions imposed on Iran. Nothing to do with fundamentals of our economy. We import 80% of our oil imports.
7510 2018-09-11 10:37:39 Your sovereignty is not under threat. What is under threat is your economy, which gives your opponents leverage. Oil is not a human right, and many other nations around the world didn't initiate wars in order to acquire it. The Germans did, and we see the results.

7559 2018-09-11 10:29:58 I think snake oil is a push. It's hardly one of a kind, but they've made a particularly good one. I do a lot in mine, and get great results. I like a kitchen gadget though, and especially one that lets me cook things I otherwise couldn't.

7576 2018-09-11 10:26:20 we definitely used a little too much oil when sautéing the garlic and ginger but that’s ok. i feel like it helped carry the pepper oils and the added fat was also good for a lot of the flavors.

7580 2018-09-11 10:25:59 Sure, I just get irritated by the snake oil of it. "Cook everything in this one of a kind contraption!" Pressure cookers are great for some things, and they're kinda rubbish for others, but they're hardly a new invention. It's just another kitchen tool.
7581 2018-09-11 10:25:44 40% of the cess collected on exile duty on oil went to infrastructure building on the borders. Govt had to invest, since no contractor was ready for PPP as traffic density to recover invested amount as toll charge was poor.
7582 2018-09-11 10:25:41 If they would have written crude oil prices of that day, the graph would have been more relatable. People would have known how easily the can be misguided.
7583 2018-09-11 10:25:12 What an irony, on a day when people are protesting fuel price hike, the oil companies further increased the prices..jale pe namak ka tadka!

7631 2018-09-11 10:18:01 I get this occasionally. Is there any pain? It's likely wax. What you need to do is warm up some olive oil (warm not hot) and trickle it into your ear. Not much of it. Then keep your head tilted for a few min. Do this about twice a day for a week. It should clear it x
7632 2018-09-11 10:17:57 I won’t be one bit surprised to hear of a move happening before the season. Oil have Signed more LHD and depth wingers. Don’t be surprised if Kass, Cags and a LH d is moved for a RHD.
7633 2018-09-11 10:17:53 I no longer eat fried food. I add just a little oil to my food if I'm the one doing the cooking. If I'm buying I insist they add no oil at all.

7641 2018-09-11 10:17:02 @realDonaldTrump The Treasury's dirty secret violates sanctions every day, and you look like a statue. Oil and banking sanctions are not fully implemented, I'm 100% sure that the Democrats will be impeached in November.
7642 2018-09-11 10:16:58 HAHA! That's a lot of questions!

OLAPLEX- please use olaplex to maintain any sort of health and strength in hair that is weak from bleaching. BATHE in it. Use an over abundance of conditioner, and try to lather it in Argan oil when it's dry. Don't brush when it's wet too!

7648 2018-09-11 10:15:55 For example, $100 per barrel on 2014 it means 100 * 55(Avg dollar price against INR) = 5500 Rs per barrel,

Now Assume $75 per barrel and avg dollar price against INR is 70Rs, So
75*70 =5250Rs
 BJP Govt buying crude oil only in difference of 250Rs 
BJP paid debt of 2lakh crores

7651 2018-09-11 10:15:17 There is mistake in graphical representation.

But here statistics tell half of the story.
It does not display the changes if crude oil prices in international market.

If that is considered, then @BJP4India will stop talking about petrol prices

Fool people r there but not all.

7659 2018-09-11 10:14:37 Our oil/tanker brokers have composed a ditty for mkt watchers:

The US is now stalling,
And Crude supply is falling,
News stories are boring,
But crude prices are soaring,
Venezuela is collapsing, 
This means no relaxing,
Because no one’s a clue,
What oil is going to do.
7660 2018-09-11 10:14:36 Fine Madam.  Please voice out for oil prices ... do you think the hiking petrol/ diesel prices will develop a Nation like India ///

7687 2018-09-11 10:10:59 When oil was trading @ 40 excise duty was being hiked aggressively... now when oil hits 78 we are letting the rupee chase it...next few days the trade for rupee & oil maybe same

7689 2018-09-11 10:10:49 There are things which you won't understand. Let me try

In Mar 2014, Intn'l crude Oil price was $107 per barrel.

In Sept 2018, Intn'l crude Oil price is $76.

1 barrel is equal to 159 litres.

If you calculate wrt UPA's time, present govt is charging Rs 14 per litre extra.

Therefore, Rs.2 lakh crore is pocket change in comparison.

7785 2018-09-11 09:59:40 Yes he did said that. Reason was at that time crude oil price was 110 dollar at international market.
7786 2018-09-11 09:59:37 More reason to reduce dependency on oil imports.
7787 2018-09-11 09:59:32 Interesting. I do try to avoid added oil as much as possible but a splash in my tea/coffee shouldn’t be an issue.

7790 2018-09-11 09:59:07 You made your point because you didn't get what I wrote in my first tweet. When govt taxed public to the tune of 16.57 (9.61)lakh crore, why does it give excuse of 2 lakh crore oil bond?

7825 2018-09-11 09:52:59 First you give proof of having @BJP4India made the non-existent bonds. Then only you can have the right to question me. First prove your baseless claim of having made the payment of oil bonds with dates of payment & interest. Don't make yourself a fool by listening to liers.
7826 2018-09-11 09:52:59 Even simpler.. Remove all import duties. Allow states to import oil at their ports... Let cheapest oil win... That competition will unleash productivity gains..

7837 2018-09-11 09:51:53 Very interesting! Sep '13 Oil was at $100 and USDZAR at 10.25, now oil is at $67 and USDZAR at 15.15. Applying the math, in Sep '13 a barrel of oil was R1025 and it is now R1015. So fuel should have decreased in real ZAR terms had it not been for theft (Tax)...

7859 2018-09-11 09:47:54 And they issued oil bonds for that oil. You can decide the prices if you dont want to pay the money.

7926 2018-09-11 09:38:32 So, you are saying out of 16.57 lakh crore, 6.96 lakh crore goes to state and 9.61 lakh crore stays with centre. Now, I think 9.61 lakh crore is a bigger amount than 2 lakh crore . What point are you trying to make, govt is fleecing public in the guise of oil bonds

7937 2018-09-11 09:36:37 It’s a pity that the MAN called “Nigeria” does not have a pinch of shame, after recovering looted monies, plus constant injection of oil money and other sources of revenue, this MAN will still go and borrow to further enslave himself.

7971 2018-09-11 09:31:35 Very sad sir Ji when BJP has cleared Loan of Iran of crude oil taken by congress sir your government can also take the loan for one year to reduce the rates of Petrol  and Diesel for 2019 Election this will boost your seats of Lok sabha 
7972 2018-09-11 09:31:27 @arunjaitley Sir, if crude oil prices and US dollar is not in your control,excise duty is in Govts control, which can be reduced to lower fuel price and also inflation due to rising fuel prices.

8039 2018-09-11 09:20:00 Cadbury tastes average compared to Whitakers... must be that palm oil?
8040 2018-09-11 09:19:50 The main reasons are:
The nonchalant attitude of waste disposal into water ways.
Inadequate line drains and improper water disposal channel's.
Building and erecting structures on water ways.
Improper sanitation and cleansing of water channels.
To mention but a few.
8041 2018-09-11 09:19:29 Though I didn't support this price of becz tax collection process from crude oil is definitely not acceptable. The dependency of more tax collection from  petrol must be changed. India is agricultural dominated nation so such way of tax collection is not acceptable.

8046 2018-09-11 09:18:56 You dont know about ethanol? How can you blindly tweet? He is clearly talking about ethanol thats made in state itself and not needed to be imported from oil producing nations. So the cost of petrol which is derivative of biofuel will be less. There is no junla here.
8047 2018-09-11 09:18:50 @radiokerry talker must have been in Aberdeen many years ago. Misleading infirmation. City now struggling since oil has started running out. Only now looking into alternative investments. Be sensible with Kerry's future, divest!

8076 2018-09-11 09:13:59 Crude oil ( Brent has gone up from 55 USD per barrel 6 months ago to 79 USD per barrel ) 

WTI crude  index is almost the same ration 

Please check your facts before u make a sweeping comment ..
this is not in good taste 


8077 2018-09-11 09:13:42 You're so right man,  why should my people in Nigeria sleep in darkness almost all every night when oil flow in our land.
8078 2018-09-11 09:13:29 why the surge in external debt during the 70s? have you heard of the worldwide oil crisis that hit non-oil producing countries so badly? have you also heard of the increase in interest rate imposed by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker? they increased it to 20%
8079 2018-09-11 09:13:24 Tamanu oil smells like weed but it's so good for my skin
8080 2018-09-11 09:13:13 Just remember Salmond said to Scotland we would be very very rich from our oil resources....can you imagine the economic mess we would be in if we had voted for Comrade Salmond and his Indy

8082 2018-09-11 09:12:58 Most of New Britain is covered by tropical rainforest though deforestation is rapid - to palm oil- no clear stats on New Ireland
8083 2018-09-11 09:12:50 If all of you protesters were actually against oil/fossil fuels, you should be campaigning the government/big companies to make changes so that there’s no demand for oil in the first place.
8084 2018-09-11 09:12:45 Sounds like lack of everything....as an owner should be doing. Throwing a bearing, lack of servicing..... old, exasperated oil, dirty air filter, clogged oil filter..... faulty sparkplugs... and everyone is guilty of not adding antifreeze to their radiator water.

8093 2018-09-11 09:11:25 I invested in UKOG. If there was an eco alternative to invest in I’d have chosen it. 

I’d love to have my electricity/Gas supply powered by 100% renewables. 

Campaigning for renewable energy will get rid of ALL oil drilling sites.

Protesting 1 site doesn’t fix anything.

8115 2018-09-11 09:08:30 ...other countries have nationalized resources without the negative impacts it has.
The world's largest oil producer is a nationalized entity for fuck's sake.

British Rail being privatized saw a far greater series of problems emerge than anything public.

8117 2018-09-11 09:08:22 though it was all drama by US govt. just to show their power.... and to defame muslim countries... and to take over the oil reservoirs... US wants their dummy govt in all countries who follow their instructions.

8119 2018-09-11 09:08:05 Hello! Just butting in on your milk chat because I got a brilliant tip recently. Apparently the trick is oil: if the "milk" DOES contain oil, it won't separate in hot drinks. If it doesn't, it will. Whatever you choose, make sure it contains oil 
8120 2018-09-11 09:08:04 All us women do these things, I would take the oil change over a night of coon hunting! 
8121 2018-09-11 09:07:46 It is well advised to continue to harvest oil and gas for what it's worth, while simultaneously investing hard in renewable energy sources which we will be more and more depended on in the future.
8122 2018-09-11 09:07:26 Venezuela nationalized the main means of production... oil.  That was horrible.  Amtrak is not a major source of commerce in the US.

8178 2018-09-11 08:58:33 You are blinded by the fact that you are from BJP and have lost all sense of proportion. Do u know that raising excise duty was also a Jumla. Do you know that oil prices rose by 325%in the period that Dr Singh was PM. The fuel prices rose by 88%. Who absorbed the rest.

8183 2018-09-11 08:57:43 Why ur linking fresh loans to outstanding oil bonds and interest repayment ? Do you have any proof provide that otherwise don't make false allegations
8184 2018-09-11 08:57:35 While I'm at it, WHAT national security? Any global hiccup & we'll be out of oil in a week. No point building canoes for the navy (or planes & tanks for the rest) if there is NO FUCKING FUEL to make them move! THINK for a change you political idiots!
8185 2018-09-11 08:57:33 Crazy how the President of the largest economy thinks. Climate change is real and it’s not because of Nature but because of Humans! Coal and Oil are going to make the situation worsen. Advocating #CleanEnergy is the only solution. @realDonaldTrump
8186 2018-09-11 08:57:17 I am sorry. I had that until I started using hemp oil. I get rock solid sleep now.
8187 2018-09-11 08:57:09 @FinMinIndia @PMOIndia why state govt can’t charge flat tax amnt instead of % for taxes? It will help to control the exponential impact during crude oil price increase @rjginnie

8191 2018-09-11 08:56:45 You’re looking for more avenues to bleed money from gullible individuals in exchange for your fairy stories. You’re a snake oil salesman preying on people who want to believe so badly they throw their critical thinking out of the window. Shame on you.

8194 2018-09-11 08:56:10 It is not only oil bonds. Union Government and state governments makes fresh loans to pay the earlier loans. The total outstanding borrowing must have come down if @BJP4India led government has not raised fresh borrowing. Can you provide the earlier borrowing & present borrowing?
8195 2018-09-11 08:55:53 @EITIorg Do you engage governments unilaterally? Or do governments need to reach out to you? I'm asking as many Gambians are worried about the country's budding oil industry which has attracted investments by Australian, Malaysian and Norwegian investors but lacks transparency
8196 2018-09-11 08:55:52 -$strong these course of oil import raste hay and so on our country face big oil problem in rate up in present times.

1) #Oil does not cool off and crosses $80 towards $90
2)  50bps hike by RBI  in Oct doesnt stop the carnage
3) #DXY zooms through 96  to a 100 (QT and hikes)
If all above conditions are met ull see the launch

8218 2018-09-11 08:51:15 For all those libergandus who hv been asking what Modi has done to Excise collection on crude oil during 2016-17. Here is the answer. He is watering nd giving nutritions to roots of India.

8245 2018-09-11 08:46:57 Ppl seem to think that plastic is somehow ‘evil’ mainly due to the disregard shown to it as a ubiquitous and therefore worthless material. Oil is a finite resource. We need to value plastic and recycle it before we regret losing it

8250 2018-09-11 08:46:27 Marks and Spencer is leading the way when it comes to responsible palm oil sourcing. We need more companies to follow their commitments and make the switch to ensure any palm oil sourced is produced in a socially and environmentally responsible way. @planamikebarry
8251 2018-09-11 08:46:17 Yeah, although unsure ako sa exact amount and potential oil reserves ng bansa. Pero as long as corporate or personal greed ang umiiral, wala talagang mangyayari sa energy and natural resources ng Pinas.
8252 2018-09-11 08:46:05 This is irrelevant question. Oil industry is capital intensive. Since independence these PSUs couldn’t generate profits & hence they always had to depend on Govt & its budgetary provisions. Is it criminal for these PSUs to gain profits & capitalise it in their further expansions?

8297 2018-09-11 08:40:45 It's not our dependence on oil, it's the government's lack of structured measures to mitigate its impact on the country. WW2 was more than 50 years ago. Why, in these 50 years, haven't we found any way to become less dependent and rely on our natural resources? #DuterteLive

8320 2018-09-11 08:37:39 Reading up on #SierraLeone  extractive sector news. Largest mines shut down, mineral railroad track stolen, falling exploration, oil licensing round suspended. Tragic after all the hopes of commodity led growth.

Revenue loss,  no excuse
8324 2018-09-11 08:37:27 But I don't know what that means here. As the thread suggests, the more radical the split the higher the regulatory/standards/tariff barriers become. I mean, we know it's snake oil but still...

8330 2018-09-11 08:37:05 I need help on this one... is she meaning to compliment Cruz by calling him “a loyal foot soldier to the Kochs “? Or did she mean to condemn him for being a Senator beholden to oil money interests? I think the former.
8331 2018-09-11 08:36:40 This was the most hilarious one yet. It was a treat. To add insult to injury, @INCIndia IT cell Smarties promptly corrected the graph asding crude oil prices,  percentage increases and gave back to @BJP4India saying, "Here's why we are better at handling economy...."
8332 2018-09-11 08:36:35 Good oil?

Be tough threshing!
8333 2018-09-11 08:36:35 @AbadaEfeJulius - the only thing the UK is joining Buhari's administration to do is to marginalized the Niger delta to siphon our oil

8337 2018-09-11 08:35:33 What in your opinion are the alternatives to plastic that garden centres might use? Plastic (a biproduct of the oil industry) is a finite resource and one which is in many cases the best material for certain uses eg in NHS (and with v low carbon impact) - recycling it is crucial

8348 2018-09-11 08:34:24 Oil prices are set to go up. It only means one thing, the fuel prices will increase here in Ghana.  Probably 1 litre 1 dollar. The cedi is struggling
8349 2018-09-11 08:34:24 I wish I no longer live by the time water became the new oil and nations are fighting over it.
8350 2018-09-11 08:34:17 Akala ko naman si Trump ang may kasalanan ng pagtaas ng mga bilihin yun pala OIL naman ngayon. Ano kaya bukas?

8352 2018-09-11 08:34:06 And that is only slightly better than the average swedish pizza! and for 'pizza salad' shredded cabnage w oil and dash of vinegar. One of those things you need to grow up on from childhood to like. Think of your worse coleslaw, remove the mayo. that's it.
8353 2018-09-11 08:34:06 Pang. Duterte: May binigay ang Panginoong Dios sa ibang tao na hindi binigay sa atin. May ibang bansa binigyan ng oil. Iyan ang hindi binigay sa atin.
Kung may oil tayo, hindi tayo magi-import.
8354 2018-09-11 08:33:56 did the president say that there's no oil in the Philippines cause God didn't give us any

8357 2018-09-11 08:33:52 Totally agree. West along with Israel and Saudi, want to control Syrian oil, so they are funding the opposition and calling them 'Freedom fighter'. But the true freedom fighters, Palestinians fighting the illegal occupation are called 'Terrorists'?. #Hypocrites

8359 2018-09-11 08:33:42 <= I beg to differ!
Famous is for real people who are true, real world, role-models for others ...
like @KrisParonto, @realDonaldTrump
@pookey258 meets none of the criteria for the use of "famous"
that account is more like this -> 
8360 2018-09-11 08:33:39 The lack of oil is at the root of the country’s economic woes? Kasalanan ni God? Hahahahaha
8361 2018-09-11 08:33:21 Were fuel prices down when Iran was allowed drilling in 2014/15/16?  No. NDA did not pass on low oil prices benefit to common Indians & now they are complaining oil prices are rising. Its like a ponzy scheme where poor citizens are like gullible customers that never make profit
8362 2018-09-11 08:33:20 No personality test I’ve ever done or seen is snake oil -even Gough many clam it!  You’re right it provides a framework for discussion. MB is interesting though not least for it’s apparent inconsistency if done twice in a few days. The answer is never rely  on any such test.
8363 2018-09-11 08:33:18 Sinisi pa yung Diyos bakit di binigyan ng oil yung Pilipinas. Hahahaha gago
8364 2018-09-11 08:33:15 You are not giving comparison of international crude oil prices during the entire period of analysis from 2004 till 2018 to give a clear picture.
8365 2018-09-11 08:33:12 せん断安定性などは判断しにくいですね。
確かにせん断による一時的粘度低下は大きいでしょうが、これはむしろ狙いで実用温度でのHTHS粘度を下げられレスポンスに繋がりますし、150℃時も一時的粘度低下が大きくとも超高VIで粘度低下がそのものが少なくHTHS粘度は確保出来ますしね。

8367 2018-09-11 08:32:47 Ang galing naman ng historical analysis ni Duterte — 5 min nagrarationalize ng economical state natin dahil may oil ang ibang bansa, tayo wala.
8368 2018-09-11 08:32:42 Sabi ni du3p wala tayong oil kaya napagiwanan tayo ng mga kalapit bayan. May oil ba ang Singapore, Taiwan, Hongkong, Japan, at South Korea?  Gaga! Akala mo lahat ng kausap mo ay ignorante!
8369 2018-09-11 08:32:37 “Hindi tayo binigyan ng Oil ng panginoong Diyos. Kaya tayo mahirap. Kaya tayo ganito.”

Ikaw na naman ang sinisi  @jesus 
You know what to do.

8374 2018-09-11 08:32:14 During FM's time that there was an oil crisis,Mrs.Marcos went to Libya and asked help from Gaddafi and we got oil directly from them. No such thing that's gonna happen now. No more OPSF.Petron ,a GOCC, was privatized too. Now we all suffer.
8375 2018-09-11 08:32:13 Hi Joe. As we don't use stabilisers, preservatives or palm oil in our nut butters, this means that there's a tendency for the natural & healthy nut oils to separate from the heavier nut solids. Make sure to always mix the natural oils back into the nuts for the best experience!
8376 2018-09-11 08:32:10 Also, diba may oil tayo??? Ano pinagsasabi niya????
8377 2018-09-11 08:32:04 What about adding an essential oil?
8378 2018-09-11 08:32:03 We didn't regulate monopolies until the oil companies got out of hand. We will deal with this one. One simple improvement would be to enforce the same ID rules as the banking system. Everyone is authenticated to ensure they only have one account, even if anonymity is allowed.
8379 2018-09-11 08:31:52 Oil kasi wala tayo. 

Balik tayo sa Bataan power plant na di napakinabangan dahil inayawan ni Cory dati. 
8380 2018-09-11 08:31:50 1521 pa wala na tayong oil, we are poor because our leaders made us poor #realtalk #philippines #duterte

8386 2018-09-11 08:31:29 Seemingly underbaked is actually more oil in the cookie to keep them soft. Tyoe if sugar and type of shirtening determines chewy or crispy cookie. Science, Dude.
8387 2018-09-11 08:31:23 I thought rice ang topic, pero bakit naging oil hmm... nakakabobo huhuhuhahahaha
8388 2018-09-11 08:31:23 Para lang akong nakikinig kay manong diyan sa sari-sari store who keeps on blaming God for not giving us oil hence our current woes. Kung maka kwento, daig pa ang paborito kong barbero sa kanto. #PresidentialStreamOfConsciousness
8389 2018-09-11 08:31:23 Oil is on Boil,  ₹81 in delhi
8390 2018-09-11 08:31:18 Asked about rice sufficiency programs: God didn't give us oil. So he resorted to things divine and out of control because it's everyone else's fault (incld God's) except his.
8391 2018-09-11 08:31:13 Maybe you just haven’t found the right essential oil. You know, medication is bad for you, with all those chemicals, you should try this organic kale and beeswax smoothie, it cured my vaccine injuries! 

That hurt to type
8392 2018-09-11 08:31:11 Wait, whut?

Sabi ni Duterte, unlike other countries, hindi daw pinagkalooban ng oil reserves ang Pilipinas? How true? OR FALSE. @UPSaribuhay
8393 2018-09-11 08:31:10 But we now have an obligation to them, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

8408 2018-09-11 08:30:49 Eh kung short naman na tayo sa oil, we should focus on other sources of energy na lang. Promote electric cars. Invest in research on renewable resources. Wag na mag import nang mag import ng oil if bumababa economy natin dahil diyan.

8411 2018-09-11 08:30:40 Is Duterte actually blaming God for not giving us oil for the oil price hikes???
8412 2018-09-11 08:30:37 Another self goal by Congress. 

If % increase in crude oil prices, between 2004-14, was much higher than % increase in per liter price of petrol, who then paid for the deficit?

The common man! Cost of subsidy was pushed on to them for a later date. That is the root of the mess.

8429 2018-09-11 08:29:08 May binigay ang Panginoong Dios sa ibang tao na di binigay sa atin. So when everyone else was rebuilding they also worked on their resources. Everyone had oil, PH has none~ PRRD
8430 2018-09-11 08:28:59 We would like to inform you that the straws are not made from plastic. They made from and eco- friendly materials like corn starch and vegetable oil that are biodegradable.
8431 2018-09-11 08:28:44 The fact is that the Congress had given subdidy when the crude oil was too high and your party was promising a panacea for every problem. When the crude prices came down nobody grudged you till the loans were repayed. It is the loot now through excise tax that is being opposed .
8432 2018-09-11 08:28:25 Ah ganon pala, sige balik uli tayo problema sa bigas, galunggong, inflation, shabu smuggling, Peter Lim, Bong Go, sa tunay na kalusugan ni Duterte, oil price hike at sa mala robin na bird ni Robin Padilla.

8434 2018-09-11 08:28:12 But the real question is when govt can manage at 73rs when crude oil was 117$ but now it averages around 50$.. the reason is they made huge economic blunders like demo and gst (causing drop of GDP) now they inflated the taxes 300% on fuel telling they need it for infrastructure
8435 2018-09-11 08:27:48 Dunking bread in the oil left after I have eaten all the anchovies

8439 2018-09-11 08:27:08 More and not less taxes are needed on imported goods like oil. It's better our forex is used for import of capital goods and technology than on fossil fuel. But no government has guts to sell petrol at Rs 130 per liter.
8440 2018-09-11 08:27:01 OPEC is the only third world organization that has lived and stood firm to support oil market stability for nearly six decades.Russia and Saudi Arabia are now designing their own OPEC to decide the future of oil market.There may no real OPEC in 1-2 years time.

8443 2018-09-11 08:26:25 Inspite of everything the benefit of low crude oil can be forwarded to us, instead of giving comparison of previous Gov. It would be beneficial for the Bjp Gov itself to lower the rates. @RSSorg @BJP4India @narendramodi

In order to make it happen, I am shutting the EPA down. So, yeah.  F you, and many people don't know this, but, I hate Pres Obama. I know words."

8596 2018-09-11 08:02:22 India lacked bringing FDI/FII in last four years. Further, import is higher than export. Which, leads to increase in the trade deficit because of buying oil in dollors. Eventually leading to drop in the value of #Indiarupee #RupeeAbove72 #RupeeVsDollar #BharatBandh.

8614 2018-09-11 07:58:49 What's the problem if Indian interest stays paramount like oil drop on the surface of choppy waters..
8615 2018-09-11 07:58:42 If u r reasonable to urself, it should bother u why a country dat made over $1trn from crude oil sales in 16yrs is deprived of good roads, good hospitals, national carriers, rail system, power supply. Now we are borrowing to do this for future economic stable
8616 2018-09-11 07:58:42 Lets be honest. Its the oil. Not just from Saudi, but Saudi keeps OPEC in order for us. And its not just the US, the whole world needs that oil to function. And not just the oil itself, but the petro-dollar keeps the US economy on top.

Basically any move we make is a bomb.
8617 2018-09-11 07:58:23 It was unpaid bcz Iran had sanctioned brother so the dues were unable to pay but now USA lifted sanctions but those money were saved by Oil India in their account which is now being able to pay...

8626 2018-09-11 07:56:52 Oil was de controlled by earlier govt. result is profitable oil companies at the cost of empty pockets of common man. It is high time govt take back control of oil prices and change prices once a month depending upon change in international prices of oil.
8627 2018-09-11 07:56:36 But I know @JJRock10 will use it as hair or body oil 
8628 2018-09-11 07:56:19 And during UPA the price of oil was high so they cut downed the taxes but by the year 2014-17 the oil prices dropped but tax was increased to a lot of % and it's still high now...
8629 2018-09-11 07:56:18 Oil is much cheaper in developed world.

8632 2018-09-11 07:55:41 There is an oil embargo by the OPEC against US, UK, etc. during those years. Please read your history.
8633 2018-09-11 07:55:32 I thought you went to IIM A. We import almost all of our oil. You are recommending short term fix for this problem. You should know why it is not advisable for country's fiscal health or to achieve fiscal deficit target.

8638 2018-09-11 07:53:55 Varified already, 
Atal ji left petrol at 44 not 36, 
and Congress left it at 72 not 76, 

and currently it's 88+ in Mumbai (avg 83) for all stats. 

but crude oil prices were too high in UPA era, 
and too low in Modi era, 
Central tax was way too less in UPA time then it is now.

8641 2018-09-11 07:53:04 That wasn't debt.... For ur information the money wasn't cleared bcz the USA sanctioned Iran due to which none of the oil importers who imports oil from Iran was able to pay but the money was saved in reserve which was paid during the year 2k14 when this sanctioned was removed
8642 2018-09-11 07:52:58 Tell the idiot communist and also the Congress leader , the crude oil in  international market are not decided by the central government it is decided by the OPEC and the Arabian countries

8745 2018-09-11 07:40:27 According to govt excise 
can only b reduced when there  is income tax and overall gst payment compliance rises. Non oil tax to gdp ratio needs to improve.. .. iska sidha Matlab abhi 100 rupees petrol kharidna parega.
8746 2018-09-11 07:40:21 Why showing incomplete data?
I'm not going in the past but when the crude oil price in 2014 was $107, we bought petrol at Rs.73/- & in 2018 when the crude oil price dropped to $71, we are paying Rs.88/- Like really? Kuch to sharm karo! @Pun_Starr @swamv39
8747 2018-09-11 07:40:18 Very cleverly our government linked oil prices with market. Timing was great. oil prices were at minimum and tax percentage were maximum. 
Now they are saying prices are driven by market not by us.
But still, ek oil k liye Modi thode chhod denge ;)

8749 2018-09-11 07:40:07 A replacement to oil (only accessible to current petro-dollar rivals) will crash US$ overnight if US doesn't ramp up. Currently because Cryptocurrency is still dependent on the same US$-petroleum based peg, it won't really replace any fiat money. You'll need to mine BTC on moon
8750 2018-09-11 07:39:57 I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on your intent, but I maintain that changing your own oil is not an efficient use of money or time. Spark plugs, sure. Valve cover gasket, maybe, depending on the vehicle. But it's cheaper and easier to pay for an oil change than to diy.
8751 2018-09-11 07:39:42 That dude Na Kerosine that by-product from Grude Oil 
8752 2018-09-11 07:39:37 The sheer stupidity of pulling out of the Iran Nuclear deal will raise oil prices, increase regional tensions and give the Iranian conservatives every incentive to re-start nuclear enrichment.  This was a foolish and dumb move.
8753 2018-09-11 07:39:32 Perhaps they're to be taken up by the Oil sector.

As far as Dollar Rupee match is concerned even the strongest economy in the world China is struggling to match.
8759 2018-09-11 07:38:42 Try corelating this nos. with global crude oil prices as well

8819 2018-09-11 07:27:43 Ah, was this a recent purchase? I'm nostalgic for the previous style it had. But I assume it was not a go-getter for many. 

I remember watching it's reports on oil prices before school in the 1990s, $15 a barrel.

8821 2018-09-11 07:27:27 是非是非
8822 2018-09-11 07:26:57 True, as the fuel prices are determined as per the market conditions
by the oil companies, there is nothing much the govt may do. However, 
the central/state govt may reduce the taxes etc but the Q is will they do
it as the same being the major source of revenue to the exchequer.

8834 2018-09-11 07:25:47 Why State governments not thinking about cutting down the VAT on the fuel products. That will help to reduce the oil prices. But instead reduce Karnataka Govt increased the tax on fuel prices then how patrol price would reduce. 
Need to think

8837 2018-09-11 07:25:31  it’s funny how people living in the most in debt country in the world talk about other countries who are better off monetarily going bankrupt. Oh I forgot to tell you, we discovered 5 more oil wells & our oil reserves jumped this year from 268 bill barrels to 333 bill.
8838 2018-09-11 07:25:25 It was a suggestion not the decision! Understand the difference before ranting on everything!

8844 2018-09-11 07:24:31 It comes off easily if you use a little oil. Like dab a little baby oil on the wipe & use.

8847 2018-09-11 07:23:22 I agree with you completely. I’m sure that is the case. Perhaps, you didn’t see the last post where I said some C students ain’t really C students but just victims of the Nigerian Education system? lol even at that, say C students rule oil companies , not the world.
8848 2018-09-11 07:23:17 So glad you like the smell of the CG Oil - the goats love it too! ; ) Great way to use it is to pop 3 drops in a pan of freshly boiled water, towel over the head and inhale for two minutes, morning and night - fab for sinus, colds, etc!x

8862 2018-09-11 07:20:54 Someone has to pay back oil bonds. Congress never spent honest money unless they got a back handers. 2g, CWG, Augusta Westland, are just few scams. Parallel economy was rampant in India. Property prices have dropped as all cash transaction reduced. Assets beyond salary needs to

8865 2018-09-11 07:20:11 If that's the case, why BJP had hit the road during UPA rule demanding reduction in fuel prices? Didn't they know reducing prices means increase in oil bill n subsidies which wasn't good for the nation? Nation first?

8869 2018-09-11 07:19:19 @narendramodi Our plan is genuine ...To get the maximum taxes from oil price and utilise it for improving the infrastructure. But it seems like the Congress party will use this  tax in 2019. Even your  hardcore supportes are frustrated and disappointed.

8890 2018-09-11 07:15:17 It's time the government stop making excuses. The sky high prices of petrol and diesel is no good. Could at least put oil in a tax slab, so the transporters could benefit from it by claiming Input Tax Credit. #deshbachao there's a difference between RULING and LEADING.

8981 2018-09-11 07:03:15 @dpradhanbjp The whole India is burning up with the increased prices. Ministry passes the buck on international crude oil price.

8982 2018-09-11 07:03:11 Not so sure. It's an age-old story. People wanted a free lunch and a bunch of snake oil salespeople queued up to sell it to them.

If India uses it's natural resources to produce electricity to drive transport by same and stops importing oil then we are again a land of surplus. Will happen!

9016 2018-09-11 06:59:37 She lied by omission. Sucks doesn't it that the guy with the most votes is not PM today! I would have a tax cut, no petrol rises, no oil and gas ban and no cursing this bloody terrible govt.

9045 2018-09-11 06:56:12 @HardeepSPuri sir can you put the price hike graph of petroleum product in india and crude oil price at international market so we can get full story of price hike 
I know you are talented as you held many high post in past but why are trying to fool us with half story
9046 2018-09-11 06:56:10 Sont forget that 3 oil  companies wiped off al.kst 25 to 47% of their net worth under vish kanya and accumulated losses of $ 2.5 billion. US prices have risen by 3 times from 1996. How much have we? 4 times. Why is vish kanya indulging in striptease?
9047 2018-09-11 06:55:53 Sir with these stories you cannot mislead the country. You maunmaun Singh in 2008 requested people of this country that they raising oil bonds the curb the prices and he also said somebody have to pay this...and that's what PM Modiji has done. Your party only misleads people
9048 2018-09-11 06:55:52 I got that. But to do so requires comparison with international oil price and clearer definition in the chart. This is deception and manipulation.
9049 2018-09-11 06:55:17 In upstream, try new ways to keep costs low, via collaboration and embracing new tech rather than allowing them spiral with a growing oil price. But difficult, I grant you.

9084 2018-09-11 06:48:55 me parece que deben investigar mejor a su personaje en cuestion. acusar porque otro me dijo es temerario. acusar por acusar es maldad y si aun mas es por ignorancia es brutalidad
9085 2018-09-11 06:48:48 What was crude oil price in international level during UPA?
And what is average crude oil price in international level during last four years?
9086 2018-09-11 06:48:46 @Narendramodi_PM Sir you was the person who pointed out about rising oil rates & Rupee downfall in UPA regime but something is happening in your regime too where common man can go now? Please check rates for the sake of common man

9089 2018-09-11 06:48:29 Also, we must access public transport rather than doing lavish by buying a luxurious motor bike or a car (many people do so) and then keep wasting money on it forever for filing the oil tank.. #NotAGreatIdea

9097 2018-09-11 06:46:28 The higher,the less dense the sky,the less engines have to "work" against the air(think of swimming in a pool of water vs of oil),the less they use fuel. But there is a limit,say 50000ft,  the air quality won't be sufficient for most airplane engines to work
9098 2018-09-11 06:46:25 Yes. That's what m saying too. It's not a % representation of price rising. Even if the hike is  0.005% still it's a hike n they should keep the bar high. It's like self trolling. Definitely eye wash as we all know oil price per barrel in international market has decreased

9123 2018-09-11 06:43:54 You are mocking all statisticians of this great country .... The world crude oil prices are massively lower than they were earlier ... So the trend should have been downward not upward .... Why dont we show the %age increase in excise duty to showcase the facts
9124 2018-09-11 06:43:54 Or get an oil change on the bucket they have now
9125 2018-09-11 06:43:52 I tried it for a bit- there are some claims that it helps whiten teeth. Based on your possible explanations, one could get the same benefits by using the coconut oil to brush with, as a toothpaste? As it’s the oil rather than the pulling that might work?
9126 2018-09-11 06:43:51 What Indian economy needs is export orientation thru cheap Rupee & low interest regime though Trump era & increasing oil price make it bad time for this. We hv lost precious opportunity of last two decades. China example shows depreciated currency necessarily not means less FDI.

9138 2018-09-11 06:41:28 Yeah, they made some absolutely daft decisions that are killing people. They approached worker-empowerment from a... i guess nationalist view? 

And ofc relied heavily on oil and didn't diversify. Dumb fuxkin decisions through and through.
9139 2018-09-11 06:41:27 Could it possibly be because Venezuela took the profits from their oil industry to fund their social programs without having an ability to keep a reserve or make more money so their factories and refineries got old and outdated rendering them useless?
9140 2018-09-11 06:41:17 You mean Norad acted like George Bush did not set up the 9/11 bombing?  I see.

2013- $95.79
2014- $98.89
2018-$67.60

Means this year 31% low then 2013
So price should be based on this for reality and it should be less. Why this figures not showing by news.

9166 2018-09-11 06:38:34 Why is it soo difficult for u to share details and reason for UPA to issue oil bonds? U have 2 choice 1st, share facts and have logical discussion, 2nd bark & avoid tough questions! I guess for the piddi u r u would choose 2nd option! And then will feel offended!

9172 2018-09-11 06:37:34 Not too unusual for exploration despite presence of oil nearby. COS calculations involve the probability of 5 factors multiplied together. Even 75% confidence in each factor results in a 24% overall geological COS.
9173 2018-09-11 06:37:04 Wrong. 9% of  GDP includes ALL oil, gas, mining and quarrying.
9174 2018-09-11 06:37:03 The Modi govt buying crude oil at cheaper price and the extra margin of profit is being utilised in several public schemes like home, free gas, electricity , toilets , medical and life insurance for the poor people. The @Congress is not able to digest it.

9176 2018-09-11 06:36:52 If you mix a teaspoon of oil w/ your conditioner it will remove frizz & make your hair smooth. Try this for 3-4 weeks, not too long. When you wash out your conditioner use cold water. Try & airdry as often as possible too, & clean out your hairbrush often. This worked for me
9177 2018-09-11 06:36:50 Are there seriously Americans who believe this? The US & proxies have spent the last 7 yrs trying to destroy Syria, like Iraq, like Libya, to take control, to steal the oil & US tax payers have funded AL-QAEDA to help do this. If I was American I'd be really really mad #FalseFlag
9178 2018-09-11 06:36:49 You forgot the oil bonds bro. This price "photo shopped" as claimed is after discounting the oil bond bills Sir. Reengineer calculations without oil bonds( now liquadated) for a true comparison of the past predictive pricing Sir.
9179 2018-09-11 06:36:43 How can you take this administration seriously when officials such as these have absolutely ZERO credibility and willingly lie through their teeth. No wonder lawyers get such a bad rep as snake oil peddlers
9180 2018-09-11 06:36:43 It's amazing how a decade gets associated with visual and auditory cues in one's mind. When I think of the 90s, I visualize a burning oil field to the sound of industrial rock.
9181 2018-09-11 06:36:27 But before 2014 crude oil prices are above 100 dollars but now it is 77 dollars there should be cut on taxes otherwise inflation will grow
9182 2018-09-11 06:36:25 The only way the govt can bring down oil prices is to slash taxes on petroleum. That would depress tax collections and upset fiscal calculations. A higher fiscal deficit or lower spending would both hurt the economy.
9183 2018-09-11 06:36:13 Yes issue oil bonds provide subsidies..increase inflation on all other commodities..pay 100 for onion..pay 11 to 12% on home loan EMI's..just do a simple search if oil subsides increase what will happen
9184 2018-09-11 06:36:10 I need olive oil to pray
9185 2018-09-11 06:36:07 Yes no one can predict the future, that is no reason not to go independent. Our economy is far more diverse than oil. The only thing dangerous is staying in the UK.
9186 2018-09-11 06:36:06 It was enacted when it was a progressive state. Before oil and republicans ruined it.
9187 2018-09-11 06:36:03 Choice of inflationary less interest, depreciated Rupee & consequent low FDI when oil price was low, ud result in less import & more export by Indian Cos earning reqd FEs. We were blinded by our big internal market & scarcity of goods & services.
9188 2018-09-11 06:36:03 The venezuelan shortages are an example of corruption, money skimming, price controls/import restrictions, and a collapsing oil economy. 

Not so much a rebuke of worker ownership, flattened hierarchies, and central organisation, nor an indicator of inevitable socialist collapse.
9189 2018-09-11 06:35:59 Despite two genuinely significant Brexit stories this morning [Mike Russell statement and oil rig closure threat] neither led the early morning Reporting Scotland. A dispute between a paralysed man and a Health Board was chosen. The oil rig story wasn't even mentioned.

9196 2018-09-11 06:35:25 All Obama was about was big Gov taking control of everything he could get his hands on. 1st Pres. to never reach 3% GDP. Many scandals the press chose not to cover. Anti oil, coal. Long bad list. Worst Pres. ever
9197 2018-09-11 06:35:00 probably delicious (tomatoes, garlic, olive oil no -brainer)...but someone needs to help you learn how to take a tasteful photo. Maybe even learn how to take a 'delicious' photo to sell it! just some FYI
9198 2018-09-11 06:34:57 It's cause the LKR is depreciating. Doubt price of oil has anything to do with this.

9206 2018-09-11 06:33:19 Deirdre Michie: the UK’s offshore oil and gas industry is essential for security of supply, supporting hundreds of thousands of highly skilled jobs and contributing billions to the economy #ogEconomicRep
9207 2018-09-11 06:33:17 We were taking thier oil/money which the monarchs use as payments to rich business families and in checked to the citizen people in certain areas. They need for us to respect thier sovereignty or else this slow invasion will never stop because we can't stop liberals
9208 2018-09-11 06:33:15 So amusing to see everyone is now fuel pricing expert. Even saw people explaining oil bonds scam. Only one problem, why #BJP and supporters kept quiet and did not envisage it when this was brazenly implemented by UPA II?  Remember helping write an article on this back in 2013.
9209 2018-09-11 06:33:05 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to Ivanka. Either that, or put it on eBay
9210 2018-09-11 06:33:01 Then where did the 2lacs Crores Cong debt went .. to whose account???
Oil barrels are less n prices are more since BJP has cleared 2lacs oils debt Sins of congis.

9212 2018-09-11 06:32:46 I tried that once and I slipped on oil that was on the ground sprained my wrist and couldn't work for 3 weeks that was on heck of a twirl though
9213 2018-09-11 06:32:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
9214 2018-09-11 06:32:31 Yep. Sad that so many people lost their lives in a pre planned attack by America/Israel to go after the oil reserves and gold of innocent countries, who then lost far far more lives. #Peace
9215 2018-09-11 06:32:17 Whenever edibles like vegetables, oil, pulses etc. become unaffordable we reduce their consumption to keep our budget under control, but don't do so in case of diesel and petrol . Why ?

9220 2018-09-11 06:31:28 If there is due oil  bond payment of 2014 UPA govt. Why @narendramodi govt is not vigorously putting it in media or this is also like why they didn't come up with white paper in 2014 on economy?

That's ur level! Neither u or @RS8185 have any answer for UPA issuing oil bonds but both will defend confidently!

9229 2018-09-11 06:30:16 As earth runs out of oil we will no longer be able to make plastic, only recycle. The #PacificOcean #IslandOfPlastic won't be enough. #Cash.
9230 2018-09-11 06:30:11 Often good economics is bad politics.ld. economist PM chose politics over good economics and left unpaid oil bonds.

9233 2018-09-11 06:29:37 And we could feed the entire world if we stopped all these WARS. America,and Britain should STOP. Between our two countries & the EU we have created massive world migration problems. We have another Vietnam going on in the Middle East. It will never end, Its all about oil
9234 2018-09-11 06:29:26 what about subsidy money to OMCs and 2 lakhs crore oil bonds not paid by congis which eventually paid by Modi govt

9239 2018-09-11 06:29:04 And what's more, is that the "Cleaning Products" sold in stores are toxic waste compared to what can be done with ingredients like coconut oil, baking soda(or washing soda depending on the desired purpose), white vinegar and water when mixed together in the right way
9240 2018-09-11 06:28:59 Here the matter is Crude Oil price is increased,  the manufacturer of Oil to be blamed means Arabi.  Hege benefits go to State Government than Center so State must reduce the Tax.  Congress must act as a role model by reducing its benefits were they rule.
9241 2018-09-11 06:28:53 No use palm oil

9248 2018-09-11 06:26:56 If oil officially runs out, what might the U.S. so?

9251 2018-09-11 06:26:16 Sir with due respect who will repay with interest oil bonds raised by UPA being payment of oil bills? Can you clarify on this to common man like me.
9252 2018-09-11 06:26:09 I have always felt the Open Session belongs to TA's who burn the midnight Oil. The Veteran Traders takeover during Mid-session to Close.
9253 2018-09-11 06:26:00 General simple formula is meat/fish/chicken/eggs either grilled or barbecued(or fried) plus yummy veges /salads with oil and vinegar etc dressings. Obvs no grains, flour in sauces etc. Do you like mushrooms, baby spinach etc? Also meat and low carb veges curried in coconut cream.
9254 2018-09-11 06:25:56 No wonder insects hate the smell of tea tree oil because have you ever smelled that nasty shit
9255 2018-09-11 06:25:47 Yesterday, #GBPUSD and #EURUSD hit sessions high as EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that it is realistic and possible to get a brexit within 8 weeks. The 8-week from now coincides almost with Iran new sanctions related to its oil exports: Hell ahead!
9256 2018-09-11 06:25:45 मान्यवर क्षमा चाहता हूँ प्रणाम करते हुए एक बात मैं भी बता दूँ कृपया इसी तरह उस समय के अख़बार से यह भी समाचार निकाल लीजिएगा कि उस समय क्रूड oil की price क्या थी और रेफ़ायनिंग cost और टैक्स क्या था समझने में थोड़ा सहूलियत हो जाएगी
9257 2018-09-11 06:25:39 The international comm is after oil and natural resources...could that even be reported upon?
9258 2018-09-11 06:25:33 The problem from day 1 gumtaj was giving special treatment n believe big boss must have agreed with all her requested such as olive oil/buffalo milk can not wake up in the morning n can not do Any task in the morning.. so basically it was Vijay tv fault for entertaining her!

9260 2018-09-11 06:24:45 What about the 2lakh ₹₹ oil bonds paid by Indian govt?
9261 2018-09-11 06:24:25 Can we also stop slut-shaming olive oil while we're at it?
9262 2018-09-11 06:24:11 These Jokers @PMOIndia  should compare the International price of the Oil that day , month , year  & $ against the Rupee . He is Selfie obsessed .@waglenikhil @Shehla_Rashid

9269 2018-09-11 06:22:48 Oil is now mainly a supply issue. Demand slowly grows very year as the population of Africa, South Asia, China etc only goes up.
9270 2018-09-11 06:22:43 It’s time the Govt machinery looked into the rising oil prices. The common man is affected- especially the middle class. With diesel also getting pricier, everything is bound to move north.
9271 2018-09-11 06:22:28 I tried cannabidiol oil. Very expensive, tastes horrible and didn’t help at all.
9272 2018-09-11 06:22:28 The discovery of oil in the Muslim nations immediately transformed 17th century sword wielding people into the 20th century bringing their barbaric practises with them, they will never assimilate into western culture
9273 2018-09-11 06:22:02 So less get this straight. No abortion,  but no care for disabled children. Send men to war but avoid paying for the consequences. Bring back asbestos but take no responsibility for any health problems.  Oil pipelines through drinking water but no health care for the victims?

9276 2018-09-11 06:21:15 South Canara foods are gud and tastes different as they use coconut oil for dosas upma and others.
9277 2018-09-11 06:21:07 The reduction in fiscal deficit and current deficit can be narrowed by cutting imports, increasing exports, widening direct tax base particularly taxing rich people at higher rate, increasing indigenous production of oil , cutting non development expenditures.
9278 2018-09-11 06:20:48 Congress ne 2 lakh crore ke oil bonds kherede the oil price kam krne ke liye jiska interest ab tak pay Kar rhi h govt.
9279 2018-09-11 06:20:46 I talk for myself, I would never want a corrupt party back. I believe that government is trying it's best to reduce oil prices and this is only a temporary inconvenience. We should explore clean energy avenues Perhaps 90 crore of tax that Rahul Gandhi evaded should be helpful.
9280 2018-09-11 06:20:37 Why Palm oil? You aware of what that product alone is doing to the environment?

9297 2018-09-11 06:18:02 Atiku & co are only interested in statistics not reality. If he calls trading -selling oil & importing everything as growth, then he is not different. Oil price was high and more people could import more items. Is that real growth?

9315 2018-09-11 06:14:42 In order to control their oil resources artificial states were created purely on TRIBAL lines specially in the arbitrarily so ARABIAN Gulf Area.

9330 2018-09-11 06:11:25 Well imagine if India says "USA cried to India not to import oil from Iran ,we said it's not your matter "
Even we can do nonsense better way.
9331 2018-09-11 06:11:09 Economically subsidising oil is like a trap , US is gaining strength and Oil price is not going to be down , how long we can subsidise ? May be for 9 month with 400 bn reserve , then loan through bond like cong , then it will be like Venezuela

9334 2018-09-11 06:10:47 Its ok, theres no oil left or its worthless. Two views promoted by the bbc in the past.
9335 2018-09-11 06:10:38 They don't affect your life because they may relate to other member states (such as olive oil production). So again, you're scaremongering. In fact, I bet you couldn't even name me 5 EU laws we've passed that you disagree with.

9337 2018-09-11 06:10:32 Optimally they work together, true. I use a Full Spectrum Hemp Extract that is 65% CBD and my caregiver mixes it with THC oil for a 1:1 ratio. He just corrected me about CBD alone killing stuff. CBD derived from hemp < 0.3% THC IS legal in the US. Local laws vary, U can research.

9366 2018-09-11 06:02:28 It is good tug of war to reduce price of oil between public and state . But surprised to note govt of India trading crude oil in Lesser price of purchase to foreign country and making home delivery at higher price therefore subsidy to foreign country at our cost .

9394 2018-09-11 05:57:05 The question remains how is Africa poor than the west, Saudi Arabia with one product oil has built an amazing profile. Why then is Africa with so many natural resources with cap in hand to the west?
9395 2018-09-11 05:57:04 International crude oil were 110 dollars per barrel now 72 dollars per barrel. Pl consider this also.
9396 2018-09-11 05:56:59 Light a candle. Grab your woman by her hand and escort her to the couch. Sit her down. Now, tell her to place her legs across your lap. Pull out some body oil. Pour a generous amount into the palm of your hands, then begin to softly rub her feet. Talk to her, but listen mostly.
9397 2018-09-11 05:56:51 So is budget deficit, inflation, subsidy and oil bonds!!
9398 2018-09-11 05:56:22 debt on india piled up to 2lk crore and was unpaid still the tax was bieng collected!. In your own state the state tax has been 1to 2 % increased. On top of that opposing oil inclusion under GST!
9399 2018-09-11 05:56:18 For the pulled pork?  Super easy.. I rub it with a seasoning blend that I like.. Personally I like Stubbs. Then I sear it in a pan with some oil.. Like 3 min on each side.

9402 2018-09-11 05:55:26 Agreed, but then taxes are also ad valorem, which benefits the state governments again. Anyway, for all the talk of the opposition regarding oil prices and the bandh yesterday, most opposition states also haven't reduced their prices on oil.

9417 2018-09-11 05:52:43 Since oil is no longer regulated oil is simple function of (average spot x USDINR ) + EXCISE + LOCAL TAXES (most significant component ). Since state are running massive defecits, they are passing the buck to central

9452 2018-09-11 05:48:49 The oil is on the one God poured it out on. You can try to steal it, but there will be a fly in it.
9453 2018-09-11 05:48:46 Iran is India's 3rd major Partner of crude oil but America has put sanctions on iran thus leading to non available of cheap crude oil. 

Government's Excise Duty on Petroleum Products has doubled since 2014. That simply means More Revenue for Govermment.
9454 2018-09-11 05:48:16 Goodnight make sure to pray to our lord and savior tea tree oil <3
9455 2018-09-11 05:48:14 LOL. I think the problem right now is not the level of prices, but the amount of taxes and the broken promises of the BJP government that are infuriating the people. Plus you have statements from one Rajasthan minister blaming the people! And BJPs hypocrisy on oil when in power.
9456 2018-09-11 05:48:11 What I find funny is that every other person parroting the “2 lakh crore oil bond” paid off...bol to aise rahe hai jaise unke fuffa ne pay karke receipt collect ki hai 
Haven’t seen a single white paper from the govt on that one.
9457 2018-09-11 05:47:50 BullF’nShit. How many times must we fall for this fake news? We’ve heard this dozens of times over the last 30 years and it’s always been false. From Saddam to Gaddafi, to whatever nation we wish to steal their oil. #BullShit
9458 2018-09-11 05:47:46 I know how I just prefer not to. Same with getting my oil changed. I know this makes me part of the stereotype.

9460 2018-09-11 05:47:29 Let’s be clear - only the government in power is creating fear in our minds with the $strengthening everyday and fuel prices rising by the week (minimum). When oil was at $140 we didn’t pay these prices - start focusing on the work on hand instead of finding ‘fake walking sticks’

9464 2018-09-11 05:46:41 so i put some lemongrass scented oil in my hair about 2 months ago and guess what???!!??!! it STILL smells like lemongrass
9465 2018-09-11 05:46:35 uuuhh i wanted to get my hair cut this week but my cars oil change was a lot more than i thought it was going to be...
9466 2018-09-11 05:46:33 Compared to what?Every pipeline leaks.There are statistics on how long it takes,on average.Instead of export,we should be refining and using in Canada.Instead of using Saudi oil?This makes sense,How?
9467 2018-09-11 05:46:22 Unless he’s eating the motor oil and tires, I don’t see how that’s related.
9468 2018-09-11 05:46:22 @DianeMariePosts forgets very little. Peak oil demand will be reached by the early 2030s, after which the drop off, precipitous or slow, will begin (see @politicalham  for detes). You, however, appear to know very little about which you speak
9469 2018-09-11 05:46:15 Also it was not paid by the govt but by the oil companies so govt did nothing there only took credit

9472 2018-09-11 05:45:59 Idiots are talking about $6.5 billion oil debt to Iran, was it paid by Modi govt like few are claiming? No, the fact is:
Essar Oil owed $3.34B
Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals ltd (MRPl) - $2.6B
IOC - $560M
HPCl - $29M
HMEl - $97M
The payment got delayed due to sanctions +1

9475 2018-09-11 05:45:29 I used to get my tires rotated with every oil change. But my new car requires oil changes at a lower frequency. Should I just get my tires rotated as before or change their schedule along with the oil change?
9476 2018-09-11 05:45:23 I treat my car so good that they should just know how good I would treat them :’) except the oil change 
9477 2018-09-11 05:45:07 Aku kurang tau juga sihh, tapi katanya kalo nyimpen face oil dijauhin dari sinar matahari, terus jangan sering-sering kecampur sama oksigen jadi abis pake langsung ditutup rapet gituu :(
9478 2018-09-11 05:45:05 Opposition did #BharatBandh to highlight rising fuel prices. What it failed to highlight effectively is the repeated hike in taxes done by Modi govt when crude oil prices plummeted to almost $30/barrel.

Majority still don't know that govt is equally responsible for high prices.

9482 2018-09-11 05:45:02 I had the itch to do it right, compare it with crude oil price and taxes.
Sad part is that someone in BJP was confident that they'll be able to get away and convince people on Twitter.
9483 2018-09-11 05:44:49 While @UKenyatta wants turk ana to get 5% of oil revenue,  where is equity here?
9484 2018-09-11 05:44:45 Can you tell me what was the fuel price in 2013? It was Rs.83 in South Gujarat. Understand lower crude oil prices which was passed in 2015-16 anyway.
9485 2018-09-11 05:44:38 As someone who does both, changing a tire is a million times simpler than learning to cook. And no one needs to know how to change their own oil.

9495 2018-09-11 05:42:56 It's usual sir when going down they create fear by giving 75 80... In reality nothing can be predicted..

9513 2018-09-11 05:40:10 Listening to @BBCr4today flitting from news on life threatening #hurricane warnings in South Carolina to discussing North Sea oil exploration with an oil and gas lobbyist. Yet no discussion of how oil exploration is contributing to rising carbon emissions and climate change!
9514 2018-09-11 05:40:08 Whether you think EV is the future or not it is certainly more sustainable than oil based fuel. A huge amount of electricity is used to process oil into fuel plus the transport with tankers on sea and road. Yes there needs to be infrastructure change/local based power production.

If my maths is ryt it should be already paid isnt that?? and price of fuel should be already reduced since crude is cheaper than b4
9535 2018-09-11 05:37:11 This would be crappy advice even if it wasn't condescending. Cheaper to pay Sears or Jiffy Lube to change your oil than it is to buy the filter & oil. Oh, and jackstands if you don't already have some.  And one of those oil pans. Then you have to dispose of the oil. Screw that.

My husband caught a  in a live trap while I was out of town once. When he opened the door to release it, the  tail fell out the door, hit my husband on the thumb & the whole mess was thrown in the air, mouse & all. Never saw that trap again. 
9556 2018-09-11 05:32:17 When increasing the petrol price you don't want to consider the Crude Oil price in other hands you want to point the Crude Oil price low but petrol price not decreased? Yes, it was not decreased but the huge Oil debit was paid by Modi govt by the balance profit.

9640 2018-09-11 05:22:18 Oil prices are steady today, supported by looming U.S. sanctions against Iran's petroleum industry. But prices are capped by signs that increased supplies by other major producers, including the US and Saudi Arabia, could make up for the disruptions from Iran.
9641 2018-09-11 05:22:15 check the crude oil price that time ....three times more then now.....dont forget the fects

9643 2018-09-11 05:21:57 we all know that the present government paid back the oil bonds money and removed all kinds of subsidies but when the fuel prices are raising like anything then why central and state govts are stubborn not reducing some tax on the same ?? @KTRTRS @narendramodi
9644 2018-09-11 05:21:55 Govt giving tax breaks to Oil Gas? Hmmm didn't they cut support for green energy?

Surely it's a market based response to policy. Are they being asked to break ideology?

Surely it's not a case of 'yeah, but not us though?' moment.

#R4today
9645 2018-09-11 05:21:50 First go through the full thread. Even after the full mat has paid for the bond. Still why they not reduce the tax on oil?

Pidi's started making equivalence of "see they want to issue NRI Bonds, but criticise us for Oil Bond"...
Do they select them based on their idiotic quotient or do they coach them later in pidi school?

Alas! BJP team will make a hash of explaining the diff.
9661 2018-09-11 05:20:23 @BJP4India wow you just stated that petroleum fuel prices have no correlation to crude oil prices and visuals are always created to make fool of people
9662 2018-09-11 05:20:21 All know the truth.... for that  UPA is just 44+ and NDA is 300+ ..... The mandate is on the basis of  "Bahaut ho gai  mehangi  ki mar  .... Ek bar Modi sarkar". But the oil price in other direction. Having a huge mandate why not GST on oil? Think  the choice is in your hand.
9663 2018-09-11 05:20:01 I agree, but the reason gas is/was so cheap in the first place is oil companies are hugely subsidized, and hid the massive externalized costs (that we're now reckoning with) from the public for decades. Humans have been socialized to accept the costs of driving for even longer.

9682 2018-09-11 05:18:14 Did you also factor in the number of jobs and investment pouring out of the AB economy? Asking for the ~100k oil jobs that have been lost.
9683 2018-09-11 05:18:03 What about spending at BC level? My understanding is we would have no defect and interest wasted could go to more resources. Oil is not what it once was but still a benefit and we are lucky...
Doesn’t mean we should be greedy though

9697 2018-09-11 05:15:56 Curiously, if I understand it correctly, the excise on oil or somesuch is supposed to be automatically lifted once oil increases a certain percentage/amount. Yet it hasn't happened.

9707 2018-09-11 05:14:31 If we would reduce our reliance on single use plastics, gas prices would level out. The demand for petroleum based polymers has much to do with oil prices.
9708 2018-09-11 05:14:14 I cook everything with coconut oil or any natural Herbs
9709 2018-09-11 05:14:07 "The grooviest and phoniest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
9710 2018-09-11 05:14:03 FYI - Gadafi was an Africa liberator. Not a dictator. The only reason US was involved is because they had interests in the oil of Libya and resources in Africa. They actually instigated the crisis. They do that when they have economic gains to make.

9712 2018-09-11 05:13:34 Having cool fancy oil from Belgium is fuckin cool till you need to add some and don’t have any at homesmh
9713 2018-09-11 05:13:17 @INCIndia Rise in petrol price is because of oil bonds issued by UPA govt on 2008. Now Modi govt has to repay all the debts.
And you conveniently pass all the blame on Modi.
Dirty politics
9714 2018-09-11 05:13:09 Ohh  really means bjp is the largest party and then too think that people in India are foolish can you please tweet the graph with  the hike of petrol prices in comparison with crude oil prices.  Why are you making people fool.

9723 2018-09-11 05:11:23 The salaries of oil & gas executives are effectively determined by -- oil & gas executives.
Same is true with other #CronyCapitalists. See shareholder activists Robert AG Monks' writings on "drone #corporations."
9724 2018-09-11 05:11:23 I need to get better about putting oil in my hair it’s sooo dry
9725 2018-09-11 05:11:20 @narendramodi Dear PM we didn't  expect  this from you when we voted in 2014 , you should  be so strong  to control rupee  against  fall so that  we don't lose money via crude oil
9726 2018-09-11 05:11:18 Deep conditioning once or twice a week, leave a virgin oil in your hair for an hour before shampooing, use a leave in after conditioning your hair. There’s many different tips

9730 2018-09-11 05:10:58 And what about your
UPA Government oil bond ??Is it true that your government convert it into loan??
9731 2018-09-11 05:10:50 @gomechanicindia Very worst experience.
These guys dont know the anything about car servicing.
For them servicing means just to change Engine Oil and Filter and thats complete.
9732 2018-09-11 05:10:49 #russia has 36000 tanks on exercise. #Britain has 156 in total.

9736 2018-09-11 05:10:03 I’m in love with the Ulta Beauty Lip Oil... I never leave without it.
9737 2018-09-11 05:10:02 And the Pidis left a 2 lakh crore oil debt to be repaid with interest.
9738 2018-09-11 05:10:01 Only winning will do that and I cant see them putting the necessary roster together to make that happen. If they can't pull it off, my guess is we see Trout traded following the 2019 World Series.
9739 2018-09-11 05:09:51 But sirji...

Why are you defending the oil price hike....

Aren't you incharge of defending rapists and lynchers...

Please look around for some more criminals to garland....

Leave economics to the educated...

9741 2018-09-11 05:09:44 With US being sole superpower  (by 6X magnitude) military power over rivals, and ubiquity of fossil fuels the peg - owning oil (or in case of Venezuela/Libya/Iraq- ensuring rivals don't use it) is the major play of monopolizing US$. A replacement to oil will crash US$ overnight.
9742 2018-09-11 05:09:37 I'm with you, but where we gonna go?  My bar is now set so low.  Don't be stupid.  Don't be unnecessarily hurtful.  Don't be a socialist.  Don't be a racist.   Don't boil puppies in oil.
9743 2018-09-11 05:09:07 we should stop calling these criminal snake oil sellers as fathers and mothers.
9744 2018-09-11 05:08:54 Oooh baby oil   xxx
9745 2018-09-11 05:08:53 Most fool party in India in congress.Congress rule between 2004 to 2013 increased petrol price from Rs 35 to Rs 84 and  used crude oil credit and not paid crude oil payment to supplying countries to the tune of 130000 lakh crores swallowed whole money. NDA paid them with interest
9746 2018-09-11 05:08:52 And these interest rates were raised because of their bad policy especially because of the financial burden called oil bonds. State owned banks were forced to bear part of the burden arising from selling petroleum below cost after the issuance of oil bonds.
9747 2018-09-11 05:08:46 Who eats potatoes just by themselves? I slice them & bake them in the oven with a little bit of avocado oil
9748 2018-09-11 05:08:30 Did you know ? 

Many people mistakenly think of LPG as a by-product. 

In reality, LPG is a valuable co-product that is produced from gas fields and crude oil refining.
9749 2018-09-11 05:08:09 But what about your 6 billions $ oil debt???

9754 2018-09-11 05:07:44 Non-dairy products usually made from combo of sugar and vegetable oil.
9755 2018-09-11 05:07:41 What will be the measure, I mean how many barrels of crude oil per Km of road constructed, how about the labor, is it going to be imported or home recruitment, How about the environmental concern . I don't think this is a solution to corruption. We won't run from responsibility.
9756 2018-09-11 05:07:13 I had a pot of oil explode in my face earlier but I got ice in places and also Black Panther is on Netflix so thing's good right now. #yesss

9760 2018-09-11 05:06:41 After he makes his hundreds of millions the rest of us should just give up. There is no way up in socialism. It is a ceiling that caps your productivity and future and there is no escape. Don’t trust the con men selling snake oil.
9761 2018-09-11 05:06:39 I’ve got black, oil paint in my tiddy.
9762 2018-09-11 05:06:34 Not to mention the 100k+ oil sector jobs over the past 3 years. People came from all over Canada, it affects every community. A mediocre govt would have instinctively protected national interests, not laughed while undermining the nation for personal gain.

9764 2018-09-11 05:06:06 How did Dubai go from an actual Sandpit to the city it is today?

Infrastructure development.

 So yea, the road works probably suck, but have a little vision, Jamaica full of potential. 

(P.s don't talk oil money here. Whatever the origin of the funds. A city was developed.)
9765 2018-09-11 05:06:03 Sad reality, sana magpagisip isip ng mga Supporters nila na "wala naman talagang pakialam sakanila yung sinosoportahan nila"
9766 2018-09-11 05:05:55 When we come to power crude oil price was very low. We have increased the excise duty and not given any benefit to people so all infrastructure work can be continued. Fine people have  accepted. Now time has changed , we have done enough infrastructure work in 4yrs. Reduce excise
9767 2018-09-11 05:05:51 The crude oil barrel in 2013 was US$93 and today it is around US$88. Not much of a difference. Anyway, I was asking Sarvanan why do jokes in 2013 vis-à-vis Pakistan terrorists entering India.
9768 2018-09-11 05:05:48 same here, like WHAT
9769 2018-09-11 05:05:45 There are only limited ounces of mined (mineable) Gold/Silver - and that worked as a good store of value for 10,000 years - but you can't eat gold or use it for productive use. Shifting to oil was natural as a barrel of oil is useful (mostly) anywhere on the planet. $<->oil 1/n
9770 2018-09-11 05:05:25 I feel like the lotion ain’t as effective as the oil but gotta know which oil to get
9771 2018-09-11 05:05:06 Tied off to a Oil Platform in the Gulf of Mexico on a Crew Boat, promptly moved the boat to a mooring buoy. The entire Gulf came to a halt no vessels moving,  no choppers in the air, just TV and SSB radio for two days. Surreal and so sad.

9774 2018-09-11 05:04:57 Is BJP aggressive on social media especially WA? I have just received WA message about 2 Lac Crores unpaid oil bonds. Did you get this message on WA?

9775 2018-09-11 05:04:17 I understood, but overall hike from 2004 should be the %, also you should compare with current price of crude oil.
Being CA you too can fool people in this way.
9776 2018-09-11 05:04:02 Kyu gand m ghusayega kya oil....
9777 2018-09-11 05:03:42 i wonder how much fracking, oil drilling, mining has been increased in the past years?  I wonder if there is a correlation?  Hmmm, I wonder
9778 2018-09-11 05:03:31 Also, oil prices were higher in 2004,2009 and 2014.

1. Fule prices deregulated by Congress. Left to market to decide.

2. Increased price of petrol by 80% btwn 2009 & 2014. Modi doing better.

3. Left a staggering ₹2 lac crore oil debt on public.
4. Exchange rate ??

But tell me more about microblading, Kayleigh. 
9792 2018-09-11 05:01:09 Actos or high dose fish oil plus low amylose diet is what was being recommended in Shoemaker protocol. There are a bunch of other approaches as well.
9793 2018-09-11 05:01:08 Hi, What do you think is wrong with plotting international crude oil prices in the chart and then make conclusions? Fuel prices are a function of crude oil prices and taxes, it does not make sense to look at the fuel prices without looking at the factors.
9794 2018-09-11 05:01:07 Time will come soon when oil prices will be cheap along with strong Economy.

9798 2018-09-11 05:00:32 Sir, if you don't know why the petrol prices are rising, then please drop the chair depute some knowledgeable person, they will handle and reduce the price. Don't forget that the additional excise duty imposed on crude oil, when the crude price was in bottom line.
9799 2018-09-11 05:00:32 How come you aren't telling them to keep thir dirtier oil in the ground?

9818 2018-09-11 04:58:17 What makes you think that I work for an oil company?  Being cognizant  of  how our country works is the responsibility of every American. Be curious about everything.

9839 2018-09-11 04:55:06 @Ford just a quick question.. I leased a 2017 Ford Explorer (Oct 2016) that included oil changes & tire rotation.., Can you tell me why after only 16,000 miles, I need new tires? Something is NOT right to me!!!
9840 2018-09-11 04:54:22 @dpradhanbjp sir you stated on 19th may that nda govt.has repaid 2 lakh crores on account of oil bonds while piyush goel on 26th may said that oil bonds are being serviced.please clarify whether oilbonds have been paid or will be paid as &when due.
9841 2018-09-11 04:54:21 @NGRPresident Before the contemporary happenings in Nigerian i used to feel ashamed of this phrase "lazy youth" until currently, same youth contribute free oil money and buy nomination form for the hard working old gentleman. For the first time I understand the irony.

Me (to heart): thank me later little guy
9844 2018-09-11 04:53:59 And how's the oil industry, which was the source for Venezuela being the richest country in south America up until the early 2000s, doing since its means of production were taken over by the gov't? How's that GM plant that was overtaken a couple years ago doing?
9845 2018-09-11 04:53:54 Should also hide Olive Oil..heard she eat some foods with Olive oil only..that much pampered shouldn't be allowed in the first place..now she's being cocky
9846 2018-09-11 04:53:53 Also are you aware of oil bonds by UPA for which India is paying to Iran in Indian currency? Yes you know it. Still you will preach such falsehood. Why not bring fuel under GST? And not claim for state govt losses. After all your Govt uses money for clubs and useless expenses.
9847 2018-09-11 04:53:42 madam they picks the data which suit them. Percentage can't be the parameter for measuring the crude oil price increase. A mathematic trick has shown by BJP to the public.
9848 2018-09-11 04:53:41 I wanted this badass teeth bleaching kit that would make my teeth glow in the dark, but the website didn't take Paypal so I have to buy one that is made from fairy farts and coconut oil.

USA isn't wat it has fooled more than half the world & almost all of Africa to believe it is.2years after the twin towers,it claimed weapons of mass destruction(WMDs)in Iraq. Did it get any? No. It was never about WMDs,it was about capturing Iraqi oil wells.

9865 2018-09-11 04:51:24 Crude Oil Prices, mountain of revenue to exchequer and a tug of war between state and central govt. A lethal weapon to west for manipulating Gulf countries.

Still under VAT out of GST (one nation one tax).
9866 2018-09-11 04:51:15 おけ
9867 2018-09-11 04:50:50 What does that even mean. Why crude oil price not in picture. When we buying crude oil and selling petrol how well a someone can control prices shows its efficiency. BJP has clearly been inefficient compared to other governments. Since it cannot deny it , it bends d facts
9868 2018-09-11 04:50:48 Mr. O'Brien, do you understand that the falsehood you are preaching is also equivalent to fake news. Your partner in the last UPA Govt deregulated oil prices. So in no way you can make such statements. If you are talking of reducing excise duty, why not reduce VAT in WB?
9869 2018-09-11 04:50:44 LINEで送る
9870 2018-09-11 04:50:36 73.70 is the next stop. Then 77 in case there is a reduction in Central Excise for Oil products!! That is why the reluctance in reducing excise or bringing fuel under GST. There is NO provision to garner more revenues. If this coincides with election, Rahul gets it on plate!!
9871 2018-09-11 04:50:28 So my text was quite salient.
Acid and an oil drum might also be an option, if one has access.

9874 2018-09-11 04:50:18 Ooohhh I gotta try olive oil
9875 2018-09-11 04:50:14 We have plenty; solar, wind, waves, hydro, water and more we probably don’t even know about. I’ve heard certain elements. The oil & gas industry just refuses to die without a fight. I think they’re also trying to buy time until they monopolize some other energy resource.
9876 2018-09-11 04:50:08 Economic policies? No jobs, no foreign policy, China showing Lal ankh in Dokhlam, Army threatening of sanctions if u buy oil from Iran.

9878 2018-09-11 04:50:02 At the time of UPA oil bonds were taken 1.44lakh crores, now this government has paid that 1.44lakh crores plus 70thpusand crores money. At least we should give credit to that, this govt has made us debt free.

9889 2018-09-11 04:48:46 multiple things I know I always blame the price of gas helping to stop spending.If people do not spend the economy stops.imho but here is someone elses.
Primary,the recession was caused by three factors:
– Sudden rise in price of oil
– “Irresponsible” usuage of Loan
– Weak Dollar
9890 2018-09-11 04:48:25 Dude, if you’re not smelly, just don’t even bother goin’.

Okay, to be generous, here’s one remedial suggestion I have for ya: Dab a little Hoppe’s 9 gun oil on ya and scratch yer fanger nails in dirt.

NOW WE’RE TALKING....
9891 2018-09-11 04:48:22 I took my car for an oil change today... shortly after that, I decided that I had adopted enough for the day and took a nap.
9892 2018-09-11 04:48:07 Thus, my taxes would have to be 39% if I were to pay my share of what all this costs without oil.
9893 2018-09-11 04:48:02 why does the oil and gas building look less ornate today than in the past, did it get re-facaded?

9895 2018-09-11 04:47:24 The BJP scored an own goal on Monday with a graphic on oil prices that sought to show the UPA government in poor light but got called out for lying, misrepresentation and a schoolboy howler.
9896 2018-09-11 04:47:22 I’m sure the Russians think they are terraforming so they can drill for more oil. Thus Trump, Tillerson, and the Saudi reformation.
9897 2018-09-11 04:47:17 congress supporters, leaders, news reporters, and other  media people should note that  in 10 years of congress rule , hike in petrol prices was 112% .
which is too high as compared today. DONT BLAME YOUR PROFESSION AND MODI, BECAUSE  CONG, GAVE AUTHORITY TO OIL COMPANIES.

9901 2018-09-11 04:46:55 I support @narendramodi and govt stand on oil prices.

People who are protesting have not read enough about how India gets oil and what is the future of oil.

And since Congress is leading the protest, this shows how much Congress cares about the Nation.
9902 2018-09-11 04:46:51 seasame oil was used as part of the marinade. Canola oil has a high smoke point and won't break down under intense heat, won't impart a flavor really, and it's cheap

9906 2018-09-11 04:45:33 But fulfilled the commitment given bond holders. Your UPA govt issued Rs 2,00,000 crores BONDS  to pay oil companies. The present govt paid all these BONDS  n kept up honour of the country.  I am glad if late u r speaking n Sonia Antonio Miano has removed stitches on it lips.

9924 2018-09-11 04:43:39 It's a fact , but increased excise duty can be reduced. And ours is a oil importing country rising crude oil, decling rupee, slowing ecinomic growth. If congress is respinsible for everything, then what BJP govt has been doing for 4 years.
9925 2018-09-11 04:43:36 It is one thing to say Gold or Oil as reserve? It is quite another to actually live by those commitments. Would you trust your money to the ChiCom government? The Chinese Businessmen have always had a good reputation. But the Chinese Communist Government is quite different.

9938 2018-09-11 04:41:44 Ironic since what has been mistaken as "oil" is just Scaramucci's leftover hair grease. Once that stain sets in you just have to start over.

9940 2018-09-11 04:41:41 No, since 2014 crude oil price got reduced but central govt increased duties to maintain retail price of fuel to end customer. Now crude price is going up but duties are kept at the same rate. Now they act as if they do not know how price got increased . Classic fooling.

9978 2018-09-11 04:37:14 The point is, orang kita biasa guna term 'panaskan enjin' before drive. 
Sebenarnya 'panas or temperature ni tak perlu pon utk enjin ready untuk mengambil load (gears, transmission etc).
Yg penting, engine's lube oil & cooling system circulation/cycle tu ada masa utk complete.
9979 2018-09-11 04:36:51 Now that I think about it, I’ll probably have to change my oil/gas ratio but I haven’t been able to ride it yet...so I don’t know...60:1 seems fine tbh
9980 2018-09-11 04:36:50 Oil prices are dropping for the past week but so is Rupee against $
9981 2018-09-11 04:36:47 @tedcruz - @realDonaldTrump was right when he called got lyin’ Ted. Stop telling lies in your campaign about Beto. Texans are smart.
9982 2018-09-11 04:36:31 motor oil isnt for drinking
9983 2018-09-11 04:36:21 Should be "You're in Oil Country"
9984 2018-09-11 04:35:59 Lots salt and 3-4 counts of olive oil. Had my neighbor do it once and it was the best ever so I do it now.
9985 2018-09-11 04:35:50 I live for the thrill of peppermint oil on my skin
9986 2018-09-11 04:35:47 Doesn't matter if it also hits  , MAA BETE और MOAN SINGH ने जो oil bond issue किए थे उनके बियआज़ भी चुकाना है अभी

9988 2018-09-11 04:35:30 I've heard we should boycott palm oil. Orangutans are getting into the oil palm fruit and dying of CVD.
9989 2018-09-11 04:35:25 TBH would be a great meme for the Oil & Gas industry because, to be honest, they get property tax rebates. And TBH they already admitted they can’t afford our health&safety during the Martinez bill. #TBH Thanks to Tracee Bentley admitting that when I was at the senate hearing.
9990 2018-09-11 04:35:23 lol we was like oil and water

Purana Raj bari no.2 konungmamang opposite kusum oil pump, lmphal Manipur India pin no.795005
9992 2018-09-11 04:35:10 In all fairness trying to tackle Gurley and Lynch is like trying to tackle two trucks covered in canola oil.
9993 2018-09-11 04:34:32 Try mixing pure organic coconut oil with fine Sodium bicarbonate....  as a mask... wash off with warm water... 2 or 3 times a week.
9994 2018-09-11 04:34:27 coba pake face oil/minyak zaitun dipijet
9995 2018-09-11 04:33:58 Global factors have nothing to do with petrol price. It is your excise duty raised 9 times when oil was 40$
9996 2018-09-11 04:33:53 さっちゃんに田舎でごめんねと謝りたいレベル
9997 2018-09-11 04:33:29 You have point. But how central would have funded the higher budgetary support for NHAI, railways, PMGSY etc? How they would have paid oil bond & payment due to Iran?
9998 2018-09-11 04:33:10 Oil important to both Saskatchewan and Alberta economies. Don’t need a degree in political science to figure this one out.

10000 2018-09-11 04:33:09 Reasons behind petrol price hike as explained by BJP

Congress was responsible
In 2017 Crude oil @ 55$
OPEC Countries have increased crude price, they are responsible.
In Sep-2018, Crude oil @ 65$
Dollar means USA is responsible.
10001 2018-09-11 04:33:04 Discovery of oil and its uses
10002 2018-09-11 04:32:50 Well moisturized dear, that the major key. Aku pake oil buat ngikat "air" buat tetap di dalam kulit karena pake pelembab doang tanpa "diikat" bisa bikin moisture loss tapi sebelumnya muka harus bener2 bersih (double cleanse always) dan jangan over exfoliating 
10003 2018-09-11 04:32:35 First go n check d prices of crude oil after 2010, it's more dan 100 $ barrel & after 14 it got halved. So, don't show one side of data. Come with whole data & details. It's clear that recent government is doing corruption in the name of oil. Everyone knows where r we heading.
10004 2018-09-11 04:32:26 Highest remains 1.3 lakh crores the amount Congress put in oil bonds to harm future generations.
