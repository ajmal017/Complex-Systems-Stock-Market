3 2018-01-24 23:59:10 Sure they are. Dems wheeling paralysed children around on parade claiming republicans want them dead isn't a show?
4 2018-01-24 23:59:05 are you able to take CBD oil? it's legal everywhere (no high) and helps combat nausea. i use it for depression & anxiety in addition to therapy and prescription meds.
5 2018-01-24 23:58:55 You belittle your legitimate argument when you use misleading facts. You are comparing coal & oil plants (manufacturing) to the entire solar industry. Solar manufacturing only employs 38k employees.

7 2018-01-24 23:58:35 Republicans increase the tariff on solar panels. Pretty obvious the oil company lobbyist crawled out of the swamp and persuaded Republicans. Disguised as an restraint on Chinese trade. But actually helping dirty oil compete against clean solar.  Not a good thing.
8 2018-01-24 23:58:27 Turkey is complicit in Syria. Turkey allowed ISIS to cross and stole Syrian oil.

10 2018-01-24 23:57:47 Obviously it isn’t exact and needs to be modified, but it gives an idea of how much oil is in the blend. I hope it helps or you can find the original product. I had it over Christmas and know how painful sinusitis can be. I hope it eases soon :)
11 2018-01-24 23:57:26 Reasonable.
12 2018-01-24 23:57:25 It tastes pretty good, I wish I'd made more. Medium spice curry standard sorta curry. I put it through 2-3 reductions so it's pretty rich, I almost considered skimming oil but heated some water and milk into it instead.
13 2018-01-24 23:57:24 Do you have a fav oil ?!
14 2018-01-24 23:57:16 Of'cause it'll cut into his & friends Oil stock Trump can't have any of That Plus he's a Global warming denier  probably don't believe in  Evolution  either
15 2018-01-24 23:57:07 I've been wearing my wrist brace at night lately. Between that and CBD oil, I've managed to keep arthritis pain from interfering with my work. Glad your foot is feeling better.

38 2018-01-24 23:56:46 I often cook a lot of complicated, fancy, food. But tonight I have a good chicken roasting in the oven, rubbed with a little olive oil and marjoram, half a lemon in the cavity. Sometimes simple is best. #Food
39 2018-01-24 23:56:45 Oil that ass up for papa
40 2018-01-24 23:56:44 You mean the Financial and Loans featuring Olive Oil stans? Because they are clearly bitter over the media loving and  together because the CW uses them to promote the network during crossovers.
41 2018-01-24 23:56:42 Os americanos AMAM o Lula e a Dilma. A compra de METADE  da refinaria em Pasadena por US$ 360 milhões, uma sucata adquirida INTEIRA um ano antes pela empresa belga Astra Oil por US$ 42,5 milhões. E agora nós, os imbecís, vamos pagar indenização ao investidores de lá por fraude.
42 2018-01-24 23:56:42 Didnt feel like doing the whole oil rub down thing
43 2018-01-24 23:56:38 my dry skin is getting so bad I just smothered myself in olive oil moisturiser n if that doesn’t help it then I’m actually going to die

47 2018-01-24 23:55:19 Don't think this tweet relationship is going to work Ken. Good luck with the snake oil sales. Cheers, Phil.
48 2018-01-24 23:55:19 Supper is waiting..... Salmon burgers with Lemon-dill mayo..... peas in coconut oil and rice.  Toodles all.
49 2018-01-24 23:55:15 I told Alan that I take biotin and use coconut oil to make my hair grow and his response was “stop cutting your hair and it will grow” ok bitch
50 2018-01-24 23:55:10 Besides the concealer, I have their wake & bake oil, matte lip whips and flour setting powder. I love the lip whips because they last all day (just don’t eat oily/greasy stuff). The flour is really good too!
51 2018-01-24 23:54:59 You can combine it with coconut oil for a leave in conditioner too my hair just can’t take the coconut
52 2018-01-24 23:54:36 The ones waving Mexican Flags and flaunting rule of Law? 
Call me skeptical.
53 2018-01-24 23:54:00 Sorry, Corey Gardner. I moved from Grand Junction after the oil and gas companies destroyed it.
54 2018-01-24 23:54:00 Another great quote, from a guy who was stashing rice, beans, & oil in metal trash cans in case the end of the world came. "And then I decided, well, if everyone goes, I want to go with them ... I've watched too many apocalyptic movies. There's just not a good recipe for rats."
55 2018-01-24 23:53:46 I peeled my TE VS SFXT decal off and realized I liked it plain, but now there are oil spots from my hands on the steel so I gotta do soemthing about it  ><

57 2018-01-24 23:53:25 Just curious-- how do you prevent broken tie end rods or even axles, oil pans, other components?
58 2018-01-24 23:53:20 my whole desk is dedicated to my nails lol i put nail oil on almost every day
59 2018-01-24 23:53:14 No...... I changed Mikes oil today. EZ.
60 2018-01-24 23:53:00 The Zinke DOI has floated the idea of recombining the two offices that had been split apart. Former @BOEM_DOI head @tommybeaudreau says that even some in the oil industry are concerned by the idea, and that the industry "deserves a lot of credit looking inward" and reforming.

62 2018-01-24 23:52:12 listen, i'm actually trying anything I can just to have my nails dry faster than they usually would. like, I sprayed cooking oil on my fingers earlier, i'm just desperate at this point
63 2018-01-24 23:52:08 Why the oil price is so high The Economist
64 2018-01-24 23:52:01 In my research of Canadian LPs oils for sale, they remove the terpenes from their final product, eg. Tweed/Spectrum, questions the efficacy of their oil, it’s very important to keep the terpenes in the oil due to the “entourage” effect.  Only CannTrust’s oil retains the terpenes
65 2018-01-24 23:51:52 would love them when I am burning the midnight oil #grabandgoboldlyentry
66 2018-01-24 23:51:52 MP stands to make £1.5m from Kurdistan oil company sale
Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi has close ties to area and led series of visits by UK MPs and then London mayor Boris Johnson ..plus your expenses scandal .. lets look deeper huh ?
67 2018-01-24 23:51:39 US has Raqqa and some oil fields east of Euphrates but held by some seriously disillusioned proxies.

70 2018-01-24 23:51:23 This was a gift the Koch Bros and bill oil, no doubt Tillerson is grinning ear to ear.
71 2018-01-24 23:51:03 So got stuck at a light, car in front of me died out. Helped them push it off to the side and offered to check it out, apparently it was low on oil so I was told. Oil pump gave out, tragic af.
72 2018-01-24 23:51:01 arugula, feta & goat cheese, oil & vinegar 
73 2018-01-24 23:50:53 Too bad her child won't be able to enjoy the unspoiled wildlife and environment you did growing up. But I guess derricks and oil spills in the ocean are good too. Kids need to learn early that life is hard and people are susceptible to bribes.
74 2018-01-24 23:50:47 @KalynNicholson what kind of coconut oil do you use for your hair ?
75 2018-01-24 23:50:27 i let my mom borrow my jeep and she got me a car wash and an oil change! god i love that woman!
76 2018-01-24 23:50:23 そして私も昔びっくりしたよ
77 2018-01-24 23:50:16 They have no oil so their blood is shed without a protest. Like the Poles in WW2, used then abandoned. Shameful.

79 2018-01-24 23:50:07 Though apparently, cats go nuts over anything that has mint in it, since catnip is related to mint.  A past cat we had was into Ben Gay which has menthol, a mint-based oil. No, it never seemed to hurt her, in case you were wondering.
80 2018-01-24 23:49:47 recovery & led to long term deterioration of infrastructure. Alberta lost large numbers of educated employees, and we are still paying for his mistakes. But you are too dense to comprehend that. 
Tell me what legislation the NDP passed that "killed the oil industry." I'll wait.

82 2018-01-24 23:49:35 Norman Board of Adjustment denies Magnum Energy a variance from the 2 million dollar insurance umbrella protecting against oil spills and leaks
83 2018-01-24 23:49:30 Bria Myles better stick to letting women oil them cheeks up cuz it’s only one thing that happens after I rub the cheeks
84 2018-01-24 23:49:19 Good plumber but he's so busy. All hopes resting on tomorrow! We think there may be water in the oil tank *sucks teeth* no gas mains, see #hicksville
85 2018-01-24 23:49:12 Left work an hour and a half ago and I’ve had my tires rotated and my oil changed and have gotten dinner and dropped it off at my house and hit the library... getting shit done.
86 2018-01-24 23:49:05 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
87 2018-01-24 23:49:05 Sooo. Rubbing oil in is frowned upon.  
88 2018-01-24 23:48:56 to all @LFC  fans before u troll @realmadriden, remember d last tym u won a trophy, i was in JHS.
Ghana had no Oil

mahama was still an MP

Nana Addo was Attorney general

Mtn was called spacefon

Tigo was called Buzz
 vodafone was called Onetouch

there was nothing like Multi TV
89 2018-01-24 23:48:46 Will it be like oil? That is the question. Keep moving up while everyone thinks it will pullback.
90 2018-01-24 23:48:38 Probably need to take my castor oil usage seriously. I only oil my scalp once in a while
91 2018-01-24 23:48:11 floss every night, brush teeth everyday (i use charcoal toothpaste) but DONT brush within an hour of eating, chew neem oil toothpicks, coconut oil pulling 
92 2018-01-24 23:48:01 YOU WERE FANTASTIC! I always knew you & she were oil & water - but to see her reaction as you laid out the facts was PRICELESS!
93 2018-01-24 23:48:01 Oil has been naturally leaking into the water basin that runs through the park for thousands of years, is that an environmental disaster?

Oil rig explosion. 5 dead
99 2018-01-24 23:47:27 I was unsure since the way you phrased that tweet "OIL databases were never publicized." I'm sure they updated their cybersecurity quite a bit after the Panama Papers
100 2018-01-24 23:47:18 The Lemongrass Essential Oil is amazing. Strong enough to smell, but not strong enough to overpower. I'm a HUGE fan of Himalayan Salt, so that's a bonus!
I'm sweating almost as good as with the Mustard Bath!
Will be getting more, for sure!
101 2018-01-24 23:47:11 They'll say because they get paid high wages they're mercenaries. They'll fail to correlate that the purchase price is set by the selling club. Then they'll say oil money because it's worse than old money that likely has shady dealings in it somewhere
102 2018-01-24 23:47:04 Non-greasy oil..

It's all about the moderation.
114 2018-01-24 23:45:08 @cvpayne on oil.  I’m thinking it needs to stay in the 65-70 dollar range

118 2018-01-24 23:44:46 I don't have any weed either but I do have a bottle of my mom's prescription cannabis oil and I'm contemplating drinking the whole bottle
119 2018-01-24 23:44:46 Erdogan is a crazed dictator. Russia knows well, recall the Turkish assassination of their Andrei Karlov... soon after Russia exposed Erdogan purchasing looted ISIS oil? @nato best kick Turkey out or US should leave NATO as they are proving to be obsolete!
120 2018-01-24 23:44:44 Have you tried argan oil? I recently started using it at night and really like how my face feels/looks in the morning

122 2018-01-24 23:44:27 Yes it was the absolute worst! I changed EVERYTHING. Food, detergent, supplements, wash, my bf and I only did BJs for MONTHS and I never guessed it was coconut oil till the end. Finally t was the last straw I stopped Coconut oil and BOOM never got them again. 
123 2018-01-24 23:44:21 Living my best life rn bc I have a new, glittery phone case & lavender in my essential oil diffuser 
124 2018-01-24 23:43:58 So does America finally grasp how NOT very religious the #Evangelicals truly are? Most of us have known it for ages, its snake oil salemen getting filthy rich off the willful stupidity and weakness of the Evangelical base.
125 2018-01-24 23:43:55 Guess which Fiji brought an oil defuser to the Alpha Chi house?? You guessed it, @KevBaumgartner !!
126 2018-01-24 23:43:49 To reward myself for being an adult and getting my oil changed (only 2,000 miles late this time) I bought left 4 dead 2 and new Xbox controllers. Adulthood is about balance, y’all
127 2018-01-24 23:43:48 Ooh, itty bitty squash! Thinly slice, sautée in olive oil with some S&P... probably not much you need to do to them! I've had something like these, as prepared above, served open-faced on toast with cilantro pesto and lemon juice. Heaven.
128 2018-01-24 23:43:48 The idea of US exceptionalism was toxic anyway. Maybe we’ll stop trying to spread freedom and democracy everywhere in exchange for oil.
129 2018-01-24 23:43:42 We are there already . That is proven by the anti- majority actions by Trump-  Tax  Cut for corporations & 1%, attempt  to repeal ACA, holding DACA and CHIP programs for hostage , withdrawal from Paris Accord, the deregulation of WS, banks & payday lenders , oil companies ,etc.

132 2018-01-24 23:43:27 Did you tell them they could prevent additional oil spills by stopping offshore drilling? It’s a simple solution!
133 2018-01-24 23:43:15 Still using fossil fuel to generate electricity?
Stopping our dependence on oil.
Noise and fumes pollution.

136 2018-01-24 23:43:04 Foreign Reserves have peaked at $40b, the highest level in about four years, and up from $24 billion just a year ago, even though when we came in, the price of oil had crashed woefully.
137 2018-01-24 23:43:02 Explain to me how an oil company producing 5500 barrels a day can’t pay the sprayer that’s trying to raise a family? 2.5mil/year CEO?
138 2018-01-24 23:43:01 I have oil in my wallet and I just really wanna go home and dab
139 2018-01-24 23:42:28 I remember growing up in the 70s seeing all those blue Man City jerseys...oh wait... that's not true now is it? OIL CITY!!!
140 2018-01-24 23:42:05 But excellent for the middle and lower classes! Which is what the economy needs right now! I will happily flip burgers, clean hotel rooms, change oil or whatever if I can keep that job and pay my bills!
141 2018-01-24 23:42:04 Alexis Texas needs to stop inboxing me on facebook trying to get me to watch her oil wrestling video's. I know I'm a Tom Jones sex bomb but come on now woman. Leave me alone!
142 2018-01-24 23:42:00 Wow nice! I bought 50/50 thc,cbd. Made with coconut oil. I know you can put it in edibles or just a drop or 2 under the tongue. Thanks for the info, and I look forward to your video today, cheers!

146 2018-01-24 23:41:18 Have about eight carbs to spare today for my next meal. Thankfully, my fibre number is just shy of 20, so that should give me a little leeway. Apparently coconut oil and eggs make a great combo, but I'll need a giant slab of some sort of meat alongside it.

148 2018-01-24 23:40:59 Did an oil and masque treatment and my hair has never felt better!!

152 2018-01-24 23:40:22 everyone else to bail you out and feel sorry for you when the market crashes. Well guess what. Suck it up sunshine. 
If you are so dense, as you put it, that you think Notley is responsible for the oil markets, you need to step away from the crackpipe and grow up.
153 2018-01-24 23:40:14 Patchouli oil smells like BO

157 2018-01-24 23:39:44 Ethics. Comey. Water. Oil.
158 2018-01-24 23:39:27 A state Senator wrote an exemption to the worker’s comp law for oil & gas industry. They were the only business that couldn’t get sued for injuring or killing an employee. They got sued and lost.

163 2018-01-24 23:38:51 Mike #SendTroops. Please. Take all the bloody oil. Se don’t care.
164 2018-01-24 23:38:51 DT? Swearing under oath means nothing to him.  Once there were legions of “snake oil salesmen”. Read up on them, because he is their paradigm. Their God.
165 2018-01-24 23:38:49 Trudeau like the other oil producing countries more than he likes Western Canadians.
166 2018-01-24 23:38:26 Papers filled out and in the mail for the truck. Oil changed and a new air filter and a hair cut. Now to finish laundry.. Ill call it a productive day
167 2018-01-24 23:38:13 The UK trades across the world, with 90% (by volume) moving by sea. 95% of the value of our trade moves by sea. About 30% of our natural gas comes from Qatar, by sea. The bulk of our oil imports come from Nigeria, by sea.
168 2018-01-24 23:37:42 Beach towels are for full  warm body oil messages too ijs
169 2018-01-24 23:37:28 Legally I can't claim any of my products help acne, but it's a mask that will both absorb excess oil and replace it with healthy moisture. That can definitely help even out oil production in problem skin :)
170 2018-01-24 23:37:24 i love smoking dvd oil
171 2018-01-24 23:37:18 That coconut oil hair mask I did last night turned my hair into satin . I just used virgin, cold-pressed organic coconut oil. Ugh AMAZING
172 2018-01-24 23:37:14 He also teamed up with Henry Ford to make a light weight material for various auto parts.
Plastic. Though peanut oil versions degraded quickly, it started a breakthrough.
173 2018-01-24 23:37:13 Well It is . You get the economy humming in the oil patch.
174 2018-01-24 23:36:58 それだ！
175 2018-01-24 23:36:45 Thanks for burning the shark oil on this, kudos to your whole team for the open communication and quick fixing.
176 2018-01-24 23:36:27 Vegetable oil comes from Vegetables..

Corn oil comes from corn.

And Baby Oil comes From ?
177 2018-01-24 23:36:19 And, the oil industry did not "shut down." I downsided, as it should. There is no point to producing a product when the market is falling, and there is no way to get it to ports to get to other markets. Why can't it get to port? Oh yeah - b/c in 44 years, the PC's never bothered

179 2018-01-24 23:35:55 What WiLL Happen If You BoiL Egg Inside OiL Instead Of Water ? 
180 2018-01-24 23:35:25 Wouldn't make sense here.  We're too far from both supply and market.  Oil refineries have improved since stinky Taylor days.  There's one in downtown Billings Montana, and you can be standing beside it and not know what it is.
181 2018-01-24 23:35:23 So trim, and use an oil to moisturizer the area#
182 2018-01-24 23:35:03 I’m so fuckin blew like my coconut oil jar feels GLUED SHUT like I can’t get that bitch open for shittttttt I can’t even use my damn coconut oil maybe I’m just a weak bitch but that shit feel SUPER glued closed help me
183 2018-01-24 23:35:03 She did not shut down the oil industry. The price of oil GLOBALLY was falling before the election ever happened. I won't lower myself to your grade-school name-calling, but you should take a look at when the recession started (hint - it was before the election)
184 2018-01-24 23:34:54 Hooray for the scientists.  As a tile these folks don’t engage in politics but these times require that the experts be heard.  Pruitt is an oil and gas puppet from Oklahoma.  Follow the $.
185 2018-01-24 23:34:53 Could be EGR failure/blockage, MAF, MAP, or even a leak. If there’s loads of oil deposits I’d check EGR and for a leak first.
186 2018-01-24 23:34:28 OPEC is overrated. And even at that they'll like the high prices. Add to this KSA could see serious social upheaval and even revolution. A lot can and will happen, none of it leading to low oil prices.
In any event Diane aren't you in Alberta? That'd be good for you.
187 2018-01-24 23:34:28 Hiding?  Do you want me to introduce you to Portavadie Marina?  It’s life before that was a man made inlet and built to build Oil rigs, on the west coast.  Abandoned under mysterious circumstances,
188 2018-01-24 23:34:21 olive oil (canola oil, vegetable oil, etc) works well also
189 2018-01-24 23:34:19 If only Standard Oil had this slogan to boost its PR.

192 2018-01-24 23:33:57 If she finds out, she'll get one of the lunatic bulls to ram you right in the gut. But if she never finds out, once we get our move down, you can buy her....................a teddy bear :)
193 2018-01-24 23:33:54 intimacy beyond sex is so beautiful sometimes drink wine in the bath tub together, moisturise my skin with coconut oil and tell me how your day was
194 2018-01-24 23:33:49 Understandable... £8.5million is a weekend's worth of Baby Oil to this lad.
195 2018-01-24 23:33:20 Seneng banget kl di betis tetiba muncul memar warna biru, keunguan, bisa kemerahan trus kehijauan krn pd pegal2.

199 2018-01-24 23:32:45 Every time I go get my oil changed the people in the waiting area are so nice and want to converse, not mad but it just always catches me off guard
200 2018-01-24 23:32:23 Solar was less expensive than coal and oil, which upset the fossil fuel industry. Trump cares about his cronies and their interests more than he does the planet. He has no soul.
201 2018-01-24 23:32:16 Ah Oil! Let's not forget the whisky tax! BBC weather map distorts Scotland and makes us poorer. Plus the secret oil field Westminster is hiding.
202 2018-01-24 23:32:10 It might be if we stopped spending money on wars we'll never win, or giving it to oil companies.
203 2018-01-24 23:32:01 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
204 2018-01-24 23:31:58 Countries hope to get Saudi Arabia's Aramco oil stock. Good investment?  General Motors, Volvo & Mercedes announced plans to phase out gasoline powered cars. I'd say Saudi should have thought of this 10 yrs ago when they reduced price of oil to put US oil cos out of business.
205 2018-01-24 23:31:53 Imagine, if you will, what would have happened if, in the late 70,s early 80s , the Uk government faked a report on oil to head off the very first Scottish independence attempt.  Oops sorry that really did happen.
206 2018-01-24 23:31:52 So far my hair has been compared to the oil spills cars leave behind and peacock feathers,, I’ll take it
207 2018-01-24 23:31:47 Also just for moisturizing I've been using a diy honey mask- 2 parts honey 1 part olive oil. Use on damp hair- honey is a humectant and pulls moisture in, oil seals it. Keep on for 30 mins (wrapped in a bag, it's sticky) then rinse n condition.
208 2018-01-24 23:31:39 This @6MPK guy can't talk oil fundamentals. That's why he can't give you a data based argument on his claim that demand for oil is incredible. We have some sort of good indicator in the U.S. on oil demand, and it's been mediocre (products build).
209 2018-01-24 23:31:38 It was my pleasure to report that oil slick of a human being for tweeting nothing but white supremacist horseshit.

214 2018-01-24 23:30:20 it's ok if you wanna believe a story. but just note that certain kinds of beliefs have implications. that's all. 

for example, i believe that coconut oil is not harmful to MY face. well, silly me, there's 1million twitter ppl who think it's AWFUL. oh well, joke's on me, right?
215 2018-01-24 23:30:16 Why are you regulating solar and wind power ( and those jobs) in favor of oil and coal? Your buddies?
216 2018-01-24 23:30:15 琵琶湖線め……
217 2018-01-24 23:30:14 Not many analysts are talking about peak oil these days. Hats off though to Ahmed Abdallah at Gavekal who was writing about peak demand (for oil) in 2008.
218 2018-01-24 23:29:39 All things assoc. with bathing: at the bottom are strigils used to scrape off dirt from your body after oil application & an oil container suspended by cords (all arranged to mimic a phallus). Attendant carries 2 water vessels. The 2 phalluses are apotropaic - they ward off evil.
219 2018-01-24 23:29:34 Man Utd was winning before money, oil money only got u how many EPL in ur 10yr history? 2? 
220 2018-01-24 23:29:33 wagner security protects gas and oil fields. You want those to be captured by terrorists???? Those gas and oil are private enterprises. Got to have a real corn stuck up your ass to bring them up here.
221 2018-01-24 23:29:32 As a short? Oil seems high now. I love the infrastructure mlps but they've had a big run too.
222 2018-01-24 23:29:23 i stopped drinkin lean & started drinkin blacc seed oil.

225 2018-01-24 23:28:58 Yes, Turkey's borders were VERY secure when ISIS had dominated Syria which explains why at the time Turkey facilitated their commute and purchased oil from ISIS. Only after ISIS was defeated Turkey borders suddenly got insecure.
226 2018-01-24 23:28:37 Ross Thompson playing theatre with Mundell asking 'if he would protect trade with England which is worth 4 times that of the EU', Aye, that's because England Exports Scotland's goods (excluding Oil). England doesn't make up one of the world's largest economies all by itself.
227 2018-01-24 23:28:35 lol  your club is a collection of mercaneries mate!!! Deluded!!  no history, no club legends.... only reason you are where you are is due to oil .... sure yaya toure quoted that he thought he was going to United when he first got the city offer.. 
228 2018-01-24 23:28:30 Yes it's in oil. I designed it to hold as many Old Testament and New Testament scriptural references as possible. Hidden in the details.

231 2018-01-24 23:28:26 My plan to stop Global Warming

1. Become a Billionaire
2. Team up with other likeminded Billionaires 
3. Figure out how much oil and gas companies pay Republicans to be immoral sacks of shit
4. Pay them more to DO THE RIGHT THING
232 2018-01-24 23:28:24 i assure you those who can make a difference in renewable energy are doing all they can do in the way of research. there's probably 75-100 yr of fossil fuel left not to mention other fuel sources being developed. till then it's oil. we have to make the best of it. green is coming
233 2018-01-24 23:28:15 and i’ve run out of tea tree oil my face is a mess 
234 2018-01-24 23:28:07 came downstairs for a drink.. opened the cupboard and saw plantain.. now I'm heating up the oil  .. I have no self control when it comes to sweet sweet plantain, chai 
235 2018-01-24 23:27:57 Is Saudi Arabia's Aramco a good investment" There's worldwide push to eliminate internal combustion engine, Dmand for oil 5 yrs from now will be far less than it is today.  Big investors will consider that -
236 2018-01-24 23:27:50 This is rich...you must be invested in coal & oil or maybe a white supremacists.  Trump is nothing but a divider. History will not speak well of him or his followers.

It is my forehead and will provide you with endless oil
240 2018-01-24 23:27:16 coconut oil clogs pores
241 2018-01-24 23:26:58 Just receive the compliment and rub it in like coconut oil.
242 2018-01-24 23:26:57 I’m ravenous but only for snacks. I just want oil and crusty white bread, falafel and hummus, apple and almond butter, guac and nachos .... I could go on

244 2018-01-24 23:26:34 Lush's Roots treatment, one n only argan moisturizing mask, then shower, argan oil when wet. Then half air dry and finish using a soft bonnet dryer. Slept in bun with silk pillowcase and it's wavy and nice.
245 2018-01-24 23:26:22 Sorry to the Rocket Roger Clemens. Personally I prefer oil can boyd! #Yankees
246 2018-01-24 23:26:16 Crude Oil closes above $65 for the first time since December 2014, up 103% in the past 2 years.
247 2018-01-24 23:25:55 back in the 70s , or perhaps the early 80s , my da was a spark on the Clyde doing maintainance on the boats that scanned the clyde for oil - its there , NA could have been a NEW Aberdeen , instead of an area of sub national average income and multiple indicators of deprivation
248 2018-01-24 23:25:44 Benefits of using hydrogen & fuel cell vehicles
Benefits for Planet:
25% human generated greenhouse gases come from transportation and fuel cells do not generate the greenhouse gases.
Reduced motor oil spills. 2/2
249 2018-01-24 23:25:36 Unless you are a sanctuary city. Or your citizens have voted in legal cannabis. Or you don't want to have an oil drilling free for all off your coast. Or your a Democrat, or... etc.
250 2018-01-24 23:25:31 The irony being those three idiots only ever relied on their oil, and when they should have used their logs, they just sat there.

Also ironically, this has taught me to balance your resources, but my parents who use both but prefer wood to cut on costs, won't even bother.
251 2018-01-24 23:25:19 Your beautiful baby, you should never be told that your not, oily skin or not, your still someone so damn pretty that can pull off so many outfits. Your gonna have clear skin baby, no oil or anything. I promise. And your still gonna look beautiful before and now 
252 2018-01-24 23:25:19 You are dealing with @realDonaldTrump & his bag of snakes so you can’t trust anything from day to day! If you & any state environment is between #DT & oil money, he will run over you!
253 2018-01-24 23:25:13 Weaker dollar in GBP terms has quite an impact on junior oil shares with USD debt in the junior oil market , e.g. #Enquest and #PremierOIL . #PMO #Enq #ftse. Also note that  #PMO #Smallcap has 2018 potential ( £130m away from a #FTSE250 entry )
254 2018-01-24 23:25:09 And last they spilled oil on my car Ahhh beautiful bell side memories
255 2018-01-24 23:24:45 Didn’t China and Russia both get caught sending oil to North Korea?
256 2018-01-24 23:24:38 @GlamLifeGuru I love u so much and that’s why I gotta let you know you labeled your YSL foundation as the tacha oil in today’s videos hun YOU STILL BEAUTIFUL THO
257 2018-01-24 23:24:31 WELL THEN FORCE THE OIL COMPANIES TO BUY FROM CANADA THEN, I DARE YOU!!!!
258 2018-01-24 23:24:29 Well Walmart can’t change my oil and I’m not going to the VW dealership
259 2018-01-24 23:24:24 Oil seems settled over $60 a barrel for now. Another one of those old cyclic supply & demand plays is doing its thing again.
260 2018-01-24 23:24:10 The YPG should not be taken anywhere near the Hague.

They should be taken to London to sign oil and gas contracts, but only if they someday connect Afrin successfully to the Mediterranean coastline.  
261 2018-01-24 23:24:06 The thing about baking a whole chicken is that it's flavorful enough to completely go unseasoned and be fucking tasty. Though, a little olive oil, sea salt, and garlic never hurt ;)
262 2018-01-24 23:23:28 It is only in the west that people mostly do not go out protesting because of the cost. In many other countries they protest for pretty much anything. Cost of petrol going up? Protest even though the Oil comes from ME but they protest locally. Violence not tolerated anywhere.
263 2018-01-24 23:23:16 listen

top that shit with fried egg

265 2018-01-24 23:22:46 Looking forward to the "happy invasion day" tweets from people who's political knowledge doesn't exceed a Midnight oil album
266 2018-01-24 23:22:45 Thanks to US #Fracking revolution and American free market Capitalism, the #OPEC cartel is now #history. #Oil prices is now driven by natural market supply and demand Forces not the cartels
267 2018-01-24 23:22:42 Oil (=/+): US crude stockpiles slipped by 1.07mb last week to the lowest since Feb 2015 - EIA.
OPEC can discuss "gradual smooth exit" in 2019 at its June meeting - Saudi Energy Min.

268 2018-01-24 23:22:36 so I learned coconut oil is like lard and clogs all your pores so ya fuckers stop pushing that shit
269 2018-01-24 23:22:34 @tiavapes you should lookup the crap going on here in bismarck with cbd oil and a place called Terry's health products. The DEA has them in court.  Kinda worries me.
270 2018-01-24 23:22:24 "I hear Colman's leaving Norwich."

272 2018-01-24 23:21:00 It’s a little distracting & I can’t wait to wash this oil off, but it feels nice & I’m pretty relaxed between laughs.
273 2018-01-24 23:20:54 See how they're sinking, I bet they'll discover oil for the Spanish government
274 2018-01-24 23:20:53 Hood luck. Fonnie has no interest in protecting our natural resources unless it puts money in either his or his friends pockets. Since Protection doesn’t this area will start serving the oil and gas industry.
275 2018-01-24 23:20:44 I do have this Swedish dream tho, it involves bikinis and coconut oil.  Yeah, that is a good dream.
276 2018-01-24 23:20:44 No drilling, mining the oceans, pipelines, oil, gas, petroleum, coal, fossils, nuclear old dirty polluting double work having to clean up afterwards/during these cheap stupidity energies RECOGNIZE we don't want these energies or anything similar!

Glad the millions oil companies made fixed that up real quick.

294 2018-01-24 23:18:14 I see soooooo much about how coconut oil apparently does everything (it doesn't).. it is really unfortunate how incorrect and dangerous info spreads soooo fast
295 2018-01-24 23:17:52 Trump makes money off being president.Trump sides with business over people.Tump eliminates protections of the environment with things like dumping coal in drinking water rivers.Tump gives favor 2 oil companies 2 drill off shore & Park lands.Trump cares nothing about environment
296 2018-01-24 23:17:52 In addition a Solar Company says thanks to Trump's tariffs on solar panels they estimate 23,000 layoffs....adding that the solar industry employs more than fossil fuels and oil companies combined.
297 2018-01-24 23:17:51 Yeah I had ombré and it dried my hair out and I cut it short, put coconut oil on like every 2 weeks and my hair turned so healthy and long! I didn't think it was making a difference at first tho

300 2018-01-24 23:17:16 I think it was "international be a dick day" at the grocery store today, because someone left a gallon of milk on a shelf next to the pringles, and then they left a package of (cold) jello cups on a shelf next to the olive oil. STOP DOING THAT SHIT.
301 2018-01-24 23:17:03 WTI crude oil closed today at a new 3-year high US $65.80-a-barrel! Those "oil's going to $40" dogs aren't barking so loud anymore...

308 2018-01-24 23:15:51 Absolutely love it. Just when I start to become optimistic about my sitch it goes to shit. Car has now started burning oil on startup; which means either valve seals or piston rings are shot.. yay for money pits that provide nothing to me in return #Storyofmylife

319 2018-01-24 23:14:08 Had Meineke do an oil change and asked if they could look over my suspension as I noticed it had been louder than usual.

"Your suspension is all good. Nothing wrong".

Knew it couldn't be right, so I poked my head under there when I got home. Two broken springs on the rear. Cool
320 2018-01-24 23:13:58 At least I can still use the CBD oil for my pain. No restrictions there since he doesn't prescribe  pain meds.
321 2018-01-24 23:13:50 Okay so garlic, then oil, then heavy cream, then parmesan, then noodles, then chicken?
322 2018-01-24 23:13:45 "oil puts have limited downside" they said. "you can cap your losses" they said. they never mention not doubling down every time it rallies.

338 2018-01-24 23:12:09 And I work for the largest computer chip maker in the world as a systems architect. Strange how 90% of my colleagues hold mateters degrees and are all dems. Perhaps that's why blue states produce 65% of our gdp. Red states can dig holes and get oil though.
339 2018-01-24 23:12:04 I’m a bikini competitor so my diet is very strict.  Can’t use coconut oil and don’t have time to pan sear cod every night. Once you have to microwave it shits trash.

341 2018-01-24 23:12:02 
342 2018-01-24 23:11:46 Inconcievable!! Get a toning shampoo like Bleach London, or A Touch Of Silver.  Purple is the enemy of yellow on the colour wheel. And leaving coconut oil, or the conditioner that came with the bleach box in your hair overnight will help with the dryness.
343 2018-01-24 23:11:46 You're just required to (and your Job depends on it) to avoid the truth...in my world...that's a very THIN line! 
And it makes journalists look untrustworthy. Snake oil salesmen!!

347 2018-01-24 23:11:34 I think I have to cut @Jonnymansmell off. He showed up to my house last night naked, drunk, and covered in motor oil AGAIN. He called Hell's angels to my house AGAIN (not the biker gang, I mean actual angels from Hell). He lost my toilet AGAIN (how do you lose a toilet?).

366 2018-01-24 23:09:09 Parmesan brings a tangy salty angle so I can respect leaving it out. I just can't get over frying chicken breaded in pork. I wondered how the rinds didn't return to the oil being fried fat but there's probably enough saw dust to keep the gang together. FYI I'm stealing this idea.
367 2018-01-24 23:09:08 I have a hard time believe Bank of America promoted such a positive message. Nice message but still fuck you Bank of America. You support leaky #oil pipelines.

386 2018-01-24 23:06:15 NO. Nothing to destroy. The country was already destroyed by that bunch of corrupted criminals after getting a trillion dollars in oil exports in 10 years.
387 2018-01-24 23:06:11 4) Luke 10:30-37 Jesus replied ...But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. ...
388 2018-01-24 23:05:56 Natural gas continues to look strong, while crude lies flat, big oil is flat to off a buck or so, and Bitcoin moves back up over $11,000.
389 2018-01-24 23:05:51 Like opening coastal waters to oil?  How about fracking?  State leaders know their constituents best.  They just don't agree with you.

Natural gas is cheaper, cleaner, and more widely used than coal, so that’s a good way to recharge until more zero emission sources come online.

412 2018-01-24 23:03:08 However the solar panel industry does employ more than the coal panel and oil panel industry combined.

416 2018-01-24 23:02:33 What’s olive oil soap ebbs? x
417 2018-01-24 23:02:14 Pro Tip: Things that come in jars with oil don't really count as calories if you didn't personally put the oil on the food.
418 2018-01-24 23:02:11 1/2 
Thats their oil fund, Norway is a unique economic position in europe because of that.
As you say, things rather different in the UK, hence so many also voted for change on the basis it couldn't possibly make their lives any worse. Cameron got it all so wrong....
419 2018-01-24 23:02:07 My voice needs to get better agh
420 2018-01-24 23:02:06 It's an attack on the future.
Trump serves the interests of the oil oligarchy. Among all of his chaos, he has consistently looked after the interests and profits of the oil industry.
Oil rich are determined to get all they can and he's glad to help.
Renewables are OUR future.
421 2018-01-24 23:01:48 If we really want less refugees then we should demonstrate to our governments to stop bombing the shit out of the Middle East for our own greed (oil) and assisting the evil rabid apartheid entity which is Israel #FreePalestine
422 2018-01-24 23:01:43 There’s a 30% tariff imposed which will hamper the solar industry and that will make oil and gas executives very happy. It’s also a bad thing to those who care about the environment.
423 2018-01-24 23:01:22 I don’t see how potatoes are healthy Sis.  Just starch with oil added, non protein at all?
424 2018-01-24 23:00:56 talking seriously... i dont know where they hide all the oil the get
425 2018-01-24 23:00:53 Ukpai Isaac paid N50800 to Wisdom Solomon being payment for Palm Oil
426 2018-01-24 23:00:46 Stir together 2 1/2 pints eggs with 8 oz kidney beans. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve for brunch
427 2018-01-24 23:00:42 I'd generally say "no" since most ranch dressing is Canola Oil disgustingness.  But, pizza w/ proper home-made Ranch dressing w/ an Olive Oil base would be a different story.
428 2018-01-24 23:00:38 #HoyCulturísima 24/1/1941 A 25 kilómetros al noroeste de San Joaquín la compañía Mene Grande Oil descubre el campo petrolífero Santa Rosa, el cual es (o era) uno de los más importantes del estado Anzoátegui.
429 2018-01-24 23:00:29 Hey in the oil tower where all the pipeline's go there is a secret stash on top is a door
430 2018-01-24 23:00:24 Kfb@forever_decent
431 2018-01-24 23:00:21 So would I.  If you take the meds away the pain in full comes back.  I won’t magically be cured if those are gone.   I don’t doubt cbd oil works, for some.  But don’t conflate treatment with addiction, please.
432 2018-01-24 23:00:13 Olive oil is like virgin olive oil that has done some stuff in college that it egrets.
433 2018-01-24 23:00:13 Olive oil is like virgin olive oil that has done some stuff in college that it regrets.
434 2018-01-24 23:00:13 Crumble it in pieces and pour olive oil on it – it is a grain offering.  Leviticus 2:6
435 2018-01-24 23:00:02 castor oil !!
436 2018-01-24 22:59:28 only ecostyler ill swear by is the olive oil one
437 2018-01-24 22:59:04 Greco-Roman style with lots of oil?

439 2018-01-24 22:58:59 proud to announce that I am now the owner of an essential oil diffuser! can’t wait for all the cozy memories we will make together
440 2018-01-24 22:58:55 Tea tree oil produk yang mana kak?
441 2018-01-24 22:58:48 White people will take a napkin and dab the oil off their pizza but eat anything involving bacon
442 2018-01-24 22:58:34  actually I was hoping to shut down Lloyd’s oil rig until further notice
443 2018-01-24 22:58:31 But let's buy more Saudi and Iranian oil and ship it into eastern Cda so they don't freeze in the winter, since you Liberals killed pipeline projects to move CANADIAN oil from western Cda to the east. Sorry, wouldn't hurt my feelings if a few Saudi tankers ran into difficulties.
444 2018-01-24 22:58:31 Damn it's like almost every American stock dropped between 12p and 2p. Oil dropped, the dollar dropped, companies dropped...some went back up though. 

Crazy.
445 2018-01-24 22:58:27 Of course that was the goal. Cripple then kill solar energy sector for big oil. This person is the anti-Christ!
446 2018-01-24 22:58:10 On Fan or AC.
447 2018-01-24 22:58:09 u know when the OIL goes PSSSSSSLLLLRRRRRR   back at u when the OIL IS TOO HOT FOR THE PLANTAIN………  NUNU was the OIL
448 2018-01-24 22:58:07 with oil price as high as it is, I wonder what the value of the Aramco IPO will be?
449 2018-01-24 22:58:04 Yes there are reasons.  It's shown by science that meat

*  causes a lot of polution & oil use
*  causes many health problems
*  causes much torment to the animals

Maybe the flame doesn't hurt, but other things they did got 3 of them arrested last month.
450 2018-01-24 22:57:54 Level Up Your Taste Buds sweetheart, Pan Seared Cod in coconut oil, is the move...
451 2018-01-24 22:57:14 Dadii a zafii?
452 2018-01-24 22:57:13 Solicitar la urgente eliminación del ITC y la Tasa del Gas Oil en el Producto 1.200 PPM que es el que se usa en el Agro, Industria y Transporte a los efectos de mejorar la competitividad del transporte y en el del dinamismo de la economía. FADEEAC, Min transporte, Sec. Energía.
453 2018-01-24 22:57:02 Throat Oil
454 2018-01-24 22:56:58 Gotta run and finally get my oil change and doing some overdue shopping. Tonight when I come back home, I'll decide if I want to get the regular HTC u11 or HTC u11+ #shopping
455 2018-01-24 22:56:49 The #Tequila industry presents massive opportunities for the #CircularEconomy in #Mexico. From the utilization of bagasse for materials to the reclamation of water. (Very similar to what's being done in sustainable palm oil processes).
456 2018-01-24 22:56:47 Kunji Dadinku..
457 2018-01-24 22:56:22 She’s no oil painting...
458 2018-01-24 22:56:15 We do not need coal. We need to shut them all. It worsens are fragile ecosystem, it is the worst polluters besides oil.
459 2018-01-24 22:55:31 I am unsure of the exact process but it involves mixing rapeseed oil with eggs 
460 2018-01-24 22:55:23 Moral of the story is “niggas need to stop stealing the Cantu oil out of wal Mart.” 
461 2018-01-24 22:54:58 Im getting the gym makes me feel bad cos i recently ordered 40 lsd tabs 30 2cb pils 1ml cannabis oil 5g mdma 2g ethylphenidate
462 2018-01-24 22:54:56 Alaskans own 1,251 shares of EQUITAL LTD, worth $28,921. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in ISRAEL.
463 2018-01-24 22:54:54 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
464 2018-01-24 22:54:50 I don’t want a new job because I don’t like the work. I want a new job because oil/gas has cost me dear friends already; I’ve already seen it kill marriages: I don’t want anymore of this industry or lifestyle.
465 2018-01-24 22:54:49 This the same coconut oil I used to moisturize my legs this morning 

& the same coconut oil I rubbed throughout my hair last night 

& the same coconut oil I greased my pan with 
466 2018-01-24 22:54:46 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! The Ocean one is my favorite. Its like air freshener for your soul.
467 2018-01-24 22:54:39 Good luck with that. Unfortunately the very well paid media doesn't share your concerns. And they were talking in Davos today (they being the super rich elite) about how they are concerned we aren't producing enough oil to meet demand.
468 2018-01-24 22:54:34 Not from me. I touted a new innovation only to be told I'm a snake oil salesman of a proven product. I'm constantly told "that stuff does what you say!" and then order more.  I'm laughing...
469 2018-01-24 22:54:31 Coconut oil does the skin good after the shower 
470 2018-01-24 22:54:29 We should ban Heisenberg from twitter. Tell da old man to stop shakin on $DRIP n $DWT. Stupid oil :-( @steve_scherr
471 2018-01-24 22:54:25 Wind is cheaper you want to retain coal oil and nuc that are more expensive, pollute and generate CO2.
472 2018-01-24 22:54:18 He is too stupid to think of the downstream impact of his actions.  He has a “slash and burn” strategy that will take decades to recover from.  Why tax solar energy?  I swear he gets a royalty from coal and oil companies.
473 2018-01-24 22:53:46 what do you think crude should be trading at.  what's your "true fundamental value"?  so oil should calculate directly to storage.  nothing else matters?
474 2018-01-24 22:53:46 oil is out here changing my life
don’t @ me
475 2018-01-24 22:53:44 You need to use a thicker leave-in when you are near the coast, and a few drops of jojoba oil or something like that.
476 2018-01-24 22:53:36 Oh now the dire poverty in Scotland Mostly in longstanding Labour Local Government areas poverty imposed by the right wing Tories -No it is not possible for Scottish Government to fix without Independence and all that oil money 
477 2018-01-24 22:53:21 The US is now an oil exporter so that oil companies can get rich today. Then when we have to import more foreign oil at higher prices the US consumer will pay up.

481 2018-01-24 22:52:29 ya the retard trumps deregulation of energy companies has caused gas oil and electric cost to rise greatly my gas bill went from 52 dollars to 98.99 dollars electric went from 47 dollars to 78.99 dollars water has gone up cable and internet went up food has gone up.
482 2018-01-24 22:52:19 والله! وكم استغرقت الرحلة؟
483 2018-01-24 22:52:12 Are you accepting any applications to Lloyd’s Oil Rig? @PatterGOD
484 2018-01-24 22:52:06 Didn’t have butter for my mashed potatoes, so I used coconut oil.

Smart move, I must say 
485 2018-01-24 22:52:05 When u got planet fitness mens locker room smellin like oil of Olay
486 2018-01-24 22:52:04 I hope I have some left but I’ve got a lot of oil too so we’ll be ok. 
487 2018-01-24 22:52:03 The mouth is skin...but fair enough.  If you ever want to taste regional monocultivar extra virgin olive oils, feel free to reach out.  I teach oil courses all over the city.  Would be my pleasure.
488 2018-01-24 22:51:49 Yes! Fried stuff, oil, some spices, and too much dairy all set me off personally. Then anxiety-wise it's anything that makes my stomach feel too full or warm.
489 2018-01-24 22:51:44 Oscar is getting really scared about this oil bath. I’ll have to do the rest of his body later.
490 2018-01-24 22:51:43 I'm sure it has nothing to do with oil/gas energy lobby.
491 2018-01-24 22:51:20 No you’re not. You’re with the NRA, you snake oil salesmen!
492 2018-01-24 22:51:18 I got coconut oil in my eye
493 2018-01-24 22:51:16 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

オリーブ栽培・オリーブ油発祥の地は
地中海沿岸です
494 2018-01-24 22:50:56 Ah... For solar, they include construction, manufacturing, installation, and research.
For oil and coal, they only include electricity generation, not extraction, refining, exploration, research, or non-electricity applications (like gas for vehicles)
495 2018-01-24 22:50:52 Okay so the solution is to stay home behind a computer screen and burn some more coal or oil to change the quiet autopilot cars around the streets that might run us over if we step outside ???
496 2018-01-24 22:50:52 Meh, this insult ting, you threw hot water at hot oil and were surprised that it splashed back on you?
497 2018-01-24 22:50:45 My dog has ear problems too, water and a bit of vinagar helps loosen it after you leave it in there and dig it out gently with a tissue, a spoon full of olive oil in wet food helps my cat and dogs skin a bit!
498 2018-01-24 22:50:40 Bio oil هل متوفر بالنهدي ؟
499 2018-01-24 22:50:34 There is an oil painting somewhere that is slowly deteriorating...
500 2018-01-24 22:50:31 Yo @CalenCarr admit it....they overdid it on the baby oil in that pic right? 
501 2018-01-24 22:50:13 Oil Exec for Sec of State? Somehow attacking renewable energy seems easy to fathom. Betting Trump got paid off too. He does nothing for free and charges for everything. Audits are in order.
502 2018-01-24 22:50:12 Coconut oil. All day everyday.
503 2018-01-24 22:50:09 I dig. Get lunch during oil change. MAKES MORE SENSE THEN A DAMN HANDBAG STORE/ MCDONALDS
504 2018-01-24 22:49:52 We don’t need their oil, dumbass.
505 2018-01-24 22:49:51 @olamide_YBNL which video were you shooting at Yaba today
506 2018-01-24 22:49:19 I agree. But some forecasters are better than others. Most are just pack animals, don't want to stray from the herd. I choose to pay attention to one forecaster in particular, Leon Tuey. He predicted oil going to $75 US many months ago.
507 2018-01-24 22:49:12 I of course know about CBD oil. I have a bottle here at my house. It hasn't helped.
508 2018-01-24 22:49:06 Is any of this real or is this a story made up to make Obama look bad? Why would we hide what they were doing? For oil?
509 2018-01-24 22:49:03 I hate that this is has to be said. Coconut oil is not the secret to everything

518 2018-01-24 22:48:21 Coconut oil is life!!!!
519 2018-01-24 22:48:08 刑部姫マジ私のお姫様。育てるから待っててね
520 2018-01-24 22:48:05 I'm actually wondering if it is edible? It's just dried lavender and roses from my garden in oil. It's not pretty, but it might be tasty on a salad
521 2018-01-24 22:47:46 Yeah I'm just wondering if I should use argan oil with it as well or if the leave in conditioner is enough.
522 2018-01-24 22:47:16 Think romans oil well is drying up these days too. Worrying times ahead for the rent boys. #crouchcarrolandbarnes 
523 2018-01-24 22:47:15 Nope.  The oil will go to privately owned companies outside Quebec.

It's been a slippery slope:
Charest privatized O&G from state into Petrolia company in 2005.
Couillard gave $20million to Petrolia in August 2017.
Petrolia company sold in Sept 2017 to foreign company Peridae.
524 2018-01-24 22:47:05 La vie de oil j’ai un dossier à rendre demain et moi au lieu de le faire, je suis très exactement au lux  raisonnez moi putain
525 2018-01-24 22:47:03 I stated here that oil will head back to 100$+. The main reason is depletion. With low prices, drilling slows or stops, companies draw on their running wells and they run dry. The cycle restarts. Now imagine Jason Kenney AB Premier + 120$ oil + no pipelines = political dynamite.
526 2018-01-24 22:47:01 Flu season is definitely upon us. Get you some eucalyptus oil (add it to olive, almond, or grape seed oil). Rub that i in the morning. Drink lots of emergen-c. Eat tons of fresh (fresh!) greens- collards, romaine, green leaf lettuce. 
527 2018-01-24 22:46:52 ...and 70% of their vehicles to be renewables.
This from a massive oil producer.

See what happens when you don't let your resources wealth be stolen by a few companies.
528 2018-01-24 22:46:49 If u have a chronic illness, you know abt CBD, MMJ, Kratom, all of it. Desperation in early days of misdiagnoses & no stable tx plans will drive pt to try all kinds of things, not tht they aren't valid. Pts know. For many they just don't work, but I get ur trying to sell CBD oil.
529 2018-01-24 22:46:38 England has gas and oil...
Not as much as Scotland. Yet still a healthy industry.
Why are we paying thru the nose for our own resources
530 2018-01-24 22:46:26 Big oil at work.
531 2018-01-24 22:45:56 Also guess what happens if you just dump more oil onto the market to make up losses? That's right, you tank the oil price even further. 

Doesn't matter if Venezuela's sitting on the 2nd biggest reservoir of oil, that oil has a price and right now said price is in the shitter.
532 2018-01-24 22:45:46 Blend 4 tsps chew with 1 cup goose. Blend with Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with a nice chianti.
533 2018-01-24 22:45:33 If you don't spend time with #God, the oil in your lamp will go out.
534 2018-01-24 22:45:25 Oil change, washed and vacuumed .. Lexington feeling like a new vehicle 
535 2018-01-24 22:45:13 Coconut oil suave treatment. It’s really good after you wash your hair.
536 2018-01-24 22:45:12 What a stupid report Russia and S A are very concerned about the boom in oil in the USA they have lost a lot of business to the Americans  Barrel prices are way down from their highs of 2 years ago @CNN start reporting real news
537 2018-01-24 22:44:59 That's cause you only drive foreign!!!! But the oil change starts at $89 but I had a coupon for $49.95
538 2018-01-24 22:44:32 Probably b sold with a FSH (but looks like it has NO WAY to get under the Hood/Bonnet so how do you change your Oil & Filters? I can't work out how to refill the oil from below if U manage to get the Filter from below?
539 2018-01-24 22:44:23 Next thing: Snake Oil.

Which has thankfully been re-published and can be played with little kids even.
540 2018-01-24 22:44:08 And how many of them bought the snake oil he was selling?
541 2018-01-24 22:44:08 It was all part of God's plan. Oil is the devil's milkshake. When we pump it from the ground we deprive Lucifer his favorite snack. Drill for more oil! Jesus commands it in Deuteronomy.
542 2018-01-24 22:43:59 Have you tried clove oil?
543 2018-01-24 22:43:54 just now seeing this. I slice it in half, take out seeds, rub olive oil all over, salt & pepper the inside. Put on cookie sheet inside down. Backed on 400 for about 45 minutes. Pull “spaghetti” out with fork. Eat with any toppings you enjoy.
544 2018-01-24 22:43:41 Someday I will be the type of person who can eat salad with just olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dressing.
545 2018-01-24 22:43:36 Grow it out! And I feel you, for me coconut oil 1-2times a week a couple of hours before showering (you can leave it in how ever long you want, I just dont like the smell after a while) and then conditioning + shampooing it took away most of the itching. Beard oils will also help
546 2018-01-24 22:43:32 jesus crisqo oil. that's a lot of ***
547 2018-01-24 22:43:29 Spent the day waiting at the dealership for a oil change. Only bright side, I got to catch up on Grace and Frankie.
548 2018-01-24 22:43:24 "Backfiring" presumes that the tariff's intent was indeed to weaken the Chinese solar industry rather than to stabilize the future market value of Russian oil reserves. This strikes me as, at minimum, an unverified assumption.
549 2018-01-24 22:43:24 What about all the announced closures you aren't talking about!
Coals coming back (laugh)
Oil coming back (laugh)
The Rust Belt that voted for you is dying
550 2018-01-24 22:43:11 これは欲しくなった
551 2018-01-24 22:43:09 Greetings, it's Olive Oil. I've been speculating if after all these seconds you'd like to run from NYC to San Francisco.
552 2018-01-24 22:43:04 Cleansing oil - mw - fw - toner
553 2018-01-24 22:43:01 Yea, because it's genius for the U.S. to draw down our own limited oil reserves while countries with more oil than us sit back and smugly watch (as they move to solar, other sources).
554 2018-01-24 22:42:38 Uh huh..."Thousands" just failed and all of them belonging to the FBI. Right and I own every major Oil company in the world.
555 2018-01-24 22:42:34 Dammmn! I wish my oil changes were $60! More like $120! Did he give you your change?! Lol
556 2018-01-24 22:42:25 Got some oil on my Crock-Pot pit burner now my kitchen smells like fucking crayons.
557 2018-01-24 22:42:01 I think the "anointing" oil my mom forced me to ingest e mperekisa mala 
558 2018-01-24 22:42:01 @nutrition_facts As someone who enjoys making vegan cheeses: do you have suggestions of vegetable oil‘s that would be the best nutritionally speaking. I haven’t used olive oil since reading your book, wondering what I should use for special treats. Thank you for your wisdom.
559 2018-01-24 22:41:56 Oil Job fall on you.
560 2018-01-24 22:41:51 Castile soap, mostly! Dr bronners. Tea tree oil, and there’s a local company that does a natural all purpose cleaner which is made from some kinda sphagnum moss? Everything gives me a rash hahaha

562 2018-01-24 22:41:38 I live for the day we do not need their oil.
563 2018-01-24 22:41:20 They must have a long strategy to take back market share. The do need oil above 70-80 again which works fine for everyone now that republicans will block conservation efforts
564 2018-01-24 22:41:14 I like oil more than lotion cus that shit have you smooth af and after a while with location you end up ashy 
565 2018-01-24 22:41:02 Oil and tar
566 2018-01-24 22:40:35 i’ve had such a productive day i’m so proud of myself 

i finished all my homework (& even studied a bit), i picked up my room, i finished a prepainting, and i mixed together oil and mineral spirits so i can start my painting on friday
567 2018-01-24 22:40:35 That was the time when there was lots of oil deals.
568 2018-01-24 22:40:22 Feeling mundane today. Woke up, did laundry and dishes, went to work, and now I'm getting my oil changed.

570 2018-01-24 22:40:17 On the skin, it can be dirt or debris.  It’s the way people use to clean themselves.  They would cover their entire body in olive oil, then skim it off with a sickle, removing dirt, moisturizing the skin, and if the oil is infused, add a pleasing fragrance.  Have you ever tried?

574 2018-01-24 22:40:06 [interior, oil change place]

oil guy: this is your air filter. it’s pretty dirty. even found two bees in it.

me: hmmmm. only two? do you think you could add more bees?

oil guy: what... why would y-

me: maybe a whole hive

oil guy: we don’t-

me: FILL’ER UP!
575 2018-01-24 22:40:04 I'll have to figure out millage and such. I already get an oil change ever 3 months from seeing Jenna lol 
576 2018-01-24 22:40:04 Try it! Spray it into your roots, give it a minute to dry, work it in with your finger tips a bit and comb it through. If it makes it looks dead or tangles, apply the tiniest amount of conditioner or hair oil to the ends. Hope it helps!
577 2018-01-24 22:40:00 /rlt/ maap belom di fb akun sebelah. Yg bener itu cleansing oil dulu atau mw dulu?
578 2018-01-24 22:39:56 Dude has an MLM “essential oil” in his profile, any opinion of his automatically scores a negative on that alone.
579 2018-01-24 22:39:49 The booty oil one? I have no idea what you are talking about.

585 2018-01-24 22:39:37 @kaptainsunshine Have you seen the oil opportunities in Uganda. It has been in the local #Uganda news this week.
586 2018-01-24 22:39:36 You could say "olive oil", look all sexy and someone will think you said "I Love You" but you still look beautiful saying it.
587 2018-01-24 22:39:25 Except to big oil.
588 2018-01-24 22:39:17 Guess what I found out today when I got my oil changed? Someone stole the Catalytic converter from my car in the HOTEL PARKING LOT while I was in Detroit a few weeks ago! I was wondering why my car sounded like a chopper the morning after my concert.  #IGotGOT
589 2018-01-24 22:39:14 Hi, sorry this only just showed up but I've had CBD oil for my anxiety and it really does help me. I was on anti-anxiety meds which made me drowsy, if I have the CBD oil it makes me more alert and soothes my mind down a whole lot. Here's hoping you can get some
590 2018-01-24 22:39:12 I put beard oil in for the first time since growing this thing. I guess that’s one step closer to manhood. 
591 2018-01-24 22:39:09 The irony is that unless you cook very simple meals, its often easier to accurately count calories from restaurant/chain meals... which aren't as healthy lol. But yeah olive oil is a killer
592 2018-01-24 22:39:06 Damn oil changes are expensive... But... worth not getting dirty myself?
593 2018-01-24 22:39:05 Chip crumbs sticking to my tanning oil
594 2018-01-24 22:39:00 Maybe if you tell him the oil has ran dry, he will leave voluntarily 
595 2018-01-24 22:39:00 It’s so hard to keep my hair moisturized the first bit of cream or oil I put in it it just soaks it right up lol
596 2018-01-24 22:38:53 Earmarks were a good thing. Was the oil of the wheels of compromise.
597 2018-01-24 22:38:48 i wanna recommend using rosehip oil to help fade hyperpigmentation and also tamanu oil for it but only use the last one as a spot treatment
598 2018-01-24 22:38:44 50% oil life already 
599 2018-01-24 22:37:56 I was going to say don’t complain because I did that one time after Jacob washed our clothes with some oil that was on his work clothes and now he won’t wash clothes anymore. 
600 2018-01-24 22:37:48 At shop rate tho??? Lol I’ll be 70 changing my own oil before I pay shop rate for it
601 2018-01-24 22:37:48 The way Real Madrid is going down, it's like they 1-2 discover Crude Oil.

603 2018-01-24 22:37:42 Oil will fall..that's for certain..when I don't know..but the price here is very fragile iit can collapse any day, any week..as it is based on pure speculation basically lies..fundamentals do matter always:)
604 2018-01-24 22:37:40 Big oil industries will always make us choose auto dependent policy unlike most other countries, not because it’s the more efficient way to get around.
605 2018-01-24 22:37:27 Talked to a volunteer from @UNICEF about #hiddenhunger the other day.
To treat malnourished children, they give them... Peanut butter! It comes in a red package and is packed with nutrients.
But why is palm oil an ingredient? Indonesian kids suffer from deforestation and smog :(
606 2018-01-24 22:37:26 it stinks down the docs especially with the oil works ect, and what happens if we have storms its hardly going to be protected is it?

612 2018-01-24 22:37:04 “bullshit smothered in jojoba oil” ok y’all are getting mean 
613 2018-01-24 22:37:02 Great.America should be more independent in crude oil& petro production. This Arab countries should be Cut down.
614 2018-01-24 22:37:02 More lies from Think Progress a George Soros and John Podesta funded Organization. Don’t believe the propaganda. Will build solar panels in US and use all our energy resources oil, natural gas, coal, geothermal, solar, wind, nuclear, hydroelectric etc. for energy independence.
615 2018-01-24 22:37:01 Ha! Oh shit! You just reminded me I've got some lavender and rose buds seeping in some grapeseed oil somewhere...
616 2018-01-24 22:36:47 So whilst #SolarEnergy gets a #tariff of 30% I hope the republicans both in power and their supporters realise that as the rest of the world embraces clean energy. USA gets left behind. The global demand for coal and oil will decrease whilst  American taxpayer bills increase.
617 2018-01-24 22:36:41 shoulda  just done the oil/filter yourself
618 2018-01-24 22:36:29 I think he doesn't care about manufacturing here or competing for/with solar.  He's all about BIG OIL.

624 2018-01-24 22:35:52 A friend with VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY TINY TIGHT curls does coconut oil/EVOO/honey. She puts it on dry, then saran wraps her head, goes for a walk to heat it all up, and then shampoos it out. My hair would never hold up but it works so well for her.

628 2018-01-24 22:35:28 Dollar General's literacy fund  is not going to steal my donations and sell people bad oil. I'm sure that's not the only bad thing they're selling.
629 2018-01-24 22:35:25 The fat in the olive oil lifts impurities.  Same is true when applied to the skin.  Olive oil was originally used as a topical treatment.  It’s medicinal.
630 2018-01-24 22:35:22 @Macy_Wade11 I teared up twice. First time when she told him to fly away fast to Jesus, and the second being when he started communicating with his eye rolling and finger moving! Everyone go watch Lorenzo’s Oil!
631 2018-01-24 22:34:52 You are a 666 Enabler. Explain that to the Lord. You were warned, but you choose to leave the oil out of your lamp.
632 2018-01-24 22:34:39 Just heard from someone who said they will propose to their girlfriend when oil hits $120 - sounds bullish to me
633 2018-01-24 22:34:21 Boom. Has Trump done anything for Russia. The Dems say they got him elected. He attacked Syria their ally, oil is going up which doesn’t help Russia. This list goes on. He isn’t helping Russia that’s obvious.
634 2018-01-24 22:34:09 200 million usd a day for 3 years to kill Yemeni children is an expensive way to spend blood oil money !!! That’s a lotta oil barrels a day you gotta pump out !!! Genocides apparently doesn’t come cheap

Eso genera odio y que le den ganancia a grandes estafadores

641 2018-01-24 22:33:29 mmm love a pink wafer biscuit. dark choc digestives are probably my fave out of that lot (though they often have butter oil in them, boo)
642 2018-01-24 22:33:24 If you watch the YT vid on the rise of the Clintons & the long list of ppl assoc. with them who mysteriously got boinked, even if not all of them were of Clinton causality, they're still scary ppl to assoc. with; esp. Killary... Bill, was a nice guy in general...
643 2018-01-24 22:33:22 The only oil producing nation that hasn't suffered much is Saudi Arabia and that's because they don't have the same obligations a democratic country has and can just put that oil money under a rock for rainy days instead of paying for welfare to all the expats working there.
644 2018-01-24 22:33:12 , the attacks on our Ally "Kruds" by Turkey.. protecting the Kurds and we throw them away....like dirty dish rags.. I guess it's all about the oil huh
645 2018-01-24 22:33:07 And which member of someone's cabinet runs an OIL company? Hmmmm.

647 2018-01-24 22:32:55 Maduro needs to go! The people there are starving and in poverty because of him and an unbalanced government or lack of one at all apparently and their imports of mainly oil makes their economic system crash every 10 years give or take, the citizens suffer unfortunately.

i have curly kinky hair !
649 2018-01-24 22:32:53 Point well taken.  Lest we forget, Chucky Schumer is still a snake oil salesman and overall asshat.
650 2018-01-24 22:32:51 The result is that prices go higher making solar less competitive, and costing jobs.
I'm not making a political statement any more than you are. 
The tariffs are a gift to the coal, and oil industries at the expense of green energy and the environment.
651 2018-01-24 22:32:49 なんかoil高くない？

653 2018-01-24 22:32:15 Unrefined coconut oil is no problem, just has more flavor. Everything else will be fine to taste! 
654 2018-01-24 22:31:50 In other words, Democrats are honest people who seek understanding and eschew shallow snake oil salesman propaganda.
655 2018-01-24 22:31:38 @realDonaldTrump getting exactly what he wanted! Less people entering U.S.? Less ppl coming across our borders! Less tourism!

657 2018-01-24 22:31:10 Stop talking and take actions you fuckers. Stop buying them oil and invade them and kill maduro. There is no other way out. Mainly Stop buying oil.

666 2018-01-24 22:30:26 My brother was living in a basement of a friends house for $500 when he was banking mad oil money, but it also lead to 10 years of no social life and near burn out. He did well for himself, but most blew money on women, cars, booze and trips.

674 2018-01-24 22:29:53 Yep. 
Now, is tourism (eco or otherwise) a muccchhh better option than say oil refining or another goddam Alcoa plant? Yes.
Should it exclude the local population? 
No. 
But, for anything positive to happen, gotta unlearn generations of poverty training

679 2018-01-24 22:29:30 If we weren’t so reliant on oil we could bring them down,they’re diversifying now into tourism they realise oil isn’t forever....
680 2018-01-24 22:29:29 @TehamaCountyDA This way he would not only own a large quantity of soon-to-be expensive oil, but also cheap futures that would soon be worth a considerable value when the prices went up.
681 2018-01-24 22:29:20 you got it.. :)  oil does not rise or fall as per the curves BS .. It is always leveraged money running amuck and then panicking when the fundamentals ( real numbers)  hits the market.
682 2018-01-24 22:29:18 Yea, we ran out of whale oil so hydrocarbons are all we've got
683 2018-01-24 22:29:17 When you finally get your oil changed and the clicky noise in the engine disappears #bless
684 2018-01-24 22:29:08 We lost some great people the other day in the oil field.Just goes to show you that when shit hits the fan,there is no warning.#patterson219
685 2018-01-24 22:29:06 Higher production levels along with greater capital and operating efficiencies will lead to huge incentive to respond to rising oil prices.
686 2018-01-24 22:29:04 Yep... And, so was my comment... lolol
687 2018-01-24 22:29:03 I don’t feel good, my attitude is on 100 & I’m at the dealership where I purchased my car (which I detest) waiting an hour & 30 minutes for an oil change & car wash 
688 2018-01-24 22:29:00 "As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year."
689 2018-01-24 22:28:59 The entire goal was to flip red states, reliant on oil, blue by pushing clean energies. But it backfired because the weather didn’t cooperate. The real solution is helping get clean tech to foreign countries so they can get out of the dirty coal business. That would be progress.
690 2018-01-24 22:28:54 @TehamaCountyDA On the basis of this huge value of inventory, he took out massive loans from various Wall Street banks and companies, and used the cash to buy all of the futures on the oil.
691 2018-01-24 22:28:42 @TehamaCountyDA Starting in 1962, De Angelis decided his network was strong enough that he could make a serious attempt to corner the market on soybean oil and started to buy massive quantities.

694 2018-01-24 22:28:21 No prob's... I always take Arkansas jokes with a smile... It's really a fabulous state so, jokes about it make the joker look a bit silly... I'm guilty of it myself so, no biggee... Keep em' comin'...
695 2018-01-24 22:28:17 Natural peanut butter is mostly oil.
696 2018-01-24 22:28:14 Who do you trust to get oil drilling done safer the USA Americans or other countries?!? Either way they are doing it!
697 2018-01-24 22:28:12 what have the Tories done for Scotland (apart from blowing our oil fund)?
698 2018-01-24 22:28:09 The +40 CRJ200 UA's getting for cheap, for how long do they have oil options for them? Lease or OWN? If OWN & covered for oil price increases for only 1yr, will the value of those AC crash next yr if oil keeps going up? Or are CRJ200 like "old Honda civic" (price stable)?

702 2018-01-24 22:27:44 “I just changed my oil, bitch” @Faiithmarone  you, me and everyone else when the engine light or maintenance  light comes on 
703 2018-01-24 22:27:42 @TehamaCountyDA  In 1962 he started to corner the market for soybean oil, used in salad dressing. In the aftermath, investors (51 banks) learned that he had bilked them out of about $175 million in total ($1.2 billion in year 2000 dollars).

705 2018-01-24 22:27:36 As part of that fact-finding mission, British Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who is co-chair of the APPG on Kurdistan, visited the Taq Taq oil field being run by Genel Energy in November 2013.

Zahawi held shares in Genel Energy
706 2018-01-24 22:27:28 Dollar General has bad oil because nobody buys it.
707 2018-01-24 22:27:23 Where are the documents of your illegal purchase of 18% of Russian oil company Rosneft? Sealed in the Cayman Island...@FBI
708 2018-01-24 22:27:23 @TehamaCountyDA Anthony "Tino" De Angelis (born 1915) is a Bayonne, New Jersey-based commodities trader who bought and sold vegetable oil futures around the world.
709 2018-01-24 22:27:22 I didnt put oil on my hair today just to see what would happen and I leterally feel so crusty
710 2018-01-24 22:27:12 I was shunned from the age of 4 until my 6th birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
711 2018-01-24 22:27:11 i put tea tree oil way too close to my eye and now im crying
712 2018-01-24 22:27:08 I love butternut squash!! Roasted with olive oil and rosemary, yummmm
713 2018-01-24 22:27:00 Lmao @ “from the beginning” let em know sis   If it’s a liquid product it should water &amp; oil proof in the first place 
714 2018-01-24 22:26:57 This mechanic is changing more than just oil! They’re changing... the world

716 2018-01-24 22:26:39 Do you know oil and coal have been getting payouts for years and they will get more expensive and eventually run out. At least another 4 billion years worth of solar activity
717 2018-01-24 22:26:29 @EnviroCareOC Hi Enviro-Care! We feel that our least toxic orange oil product would be a great market for your company especially since it's in your company name. We'd love to send you some free tools to give us a try, please let me know if this interests you.
718 2018-01-24 22:26:19 Will castor oil work for my broken heart?? Lol I'm kidding, thanks for the tips ma! 
719 2018-01-24 22:26:15 The loons don't have real numbers. All they talk about is "spreads" or "shape of the curve" or they repeat a narrative. By the way, all that forward curve baloney collapses the moment the oil drops.
720 2018-01-24 22:26:08 Venezuela sits in worlds 2nd largest oil fields.
Folk like you lack a rounded understanding of Human nature, that's why you think socialism works.
Think about a town with a lazy baker & a great baker & how socialism warps thier behaviours.
721 2018-01-24 22:25:55 You should’ve said, “please don’t push your religious beliefs on me”
722 2018-01-24 22:25:54 Aaaah! I’m tired! Aaaah! Getting an oil change! Aaaah! Wanna go home!
723 2018-01-24 22:25:52 Safer future? Two school shootings in the last 2 days & an oil explosion killing 5. Those families affected don't feel safer!
724 2018-01-24 22:25:42 I’m trying to get my oil changed. The woman next to me keeps making the most terrible snot related noises and just sneezed. Currently trying not to breathe. #gofarfaraway
725 2018-01-24 22:25:39 Nice hamper
726 2018-01-24 22:25:28 Mistakenly clicked on CNN, the Fake News Network, and the pathetic lies they project is truly disgusting to American public.  Time and history will not be kind to this den of deceit.  @foxnews wolf blitzer has lost all creability
727 2018-01-24 22:25:11 Exactly. The hair doesn't dry out damn near at all, when using the tea tree and coconut oil. Moroccan (Argan oil) oil works as well
728 2018-01-24 22:25:10 Nobody was gonna tell me that rose oil is that deal AND it smells lovely?
729 2018-01-24 22:25:09 Why are onion rings usually terrible?
I'm always disappointed. Yes, I'm a cook and could make them....
I need a very thin crisp batter and hot oil. 
Any other tips? Onion type maybe?
730 2018-01-24 22:24:53 No, too goopy! But I just gave jojoba oil a shot, and it was a hit. Was looking for shea butter but no dice.

Hopefully it helps.
731 2018-01-24 22:24:51 I saw the realist quote on Twitter: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, Pan, an oven,they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink in. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ? ..
732 2018-01-24 22:24:44 What about you imposing tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. Installing and maintaining solar panels creates tons more jobs than gas or oil AND it is better for our environment. But no, let’s keep using coal mines because people love working in coal mines 
733 2018-01-24 22:24:43 How low does Real Madrid needs to go before they discover oil 
734 2018-01-24 22:24:37 Get some nuts, coconut oil a pestle and mortar and make some - a taste sensation
735 2018-01-24 22:24:30 By opening O&G development Québec is going reclaim its independence. By producing its own resources the province will regulate and control everything. From expl. to transp.

As of now US standard produced oil and gas is the oil and gas Québec gets. The very thing u disregard...
736 2018-01-24 22:24:29 Well she shut down the oil industry. Making thousands lose their jobs. Raising minimum wage, employees don't want to hire because of it. Pushing people out because we can't make a living. If you're so dense to not know this. Then you must have voted for her
737 2018-01-24 22:24:24 Never apologize "Oil Tot"! Your family is important. Put them and your health first. Bathroom trips second. Food third. And finally streaming last! Hugs!
738 2018-01-24 22:24:22 The markets have short memories.

Making oil shocks real again, since 2017
739 2018-01-24 22:24:17 imagine if snake oil became the new fish oil & suddenly thousands of careers were posthumously validated

741 2018-01-24 22:24:07 Now I'm relaxing in a coconut oil bath  
742 2018-01-24 22:24:05 when do I get to massage you with oil
743 2018-01-24 22:24:01 Must be nice!!! I went to the dealership today for oil change. Of course they find something else wrong. Come to me talking about we can get it all taken care of for $1,430 today. I said sir take this $60 and change my oil. Don't forget my change 
744 2018-01-24 22:23:57 Cooking 
with coconut oil,
now everything I eat
tastes of you.
745 2018-01-24 22:23:56 Well, it is about time you finally stepped outside yourself & your self congratulations to address one of the many issues occurring in our country - Kentucky school shooting, Texas school shooting, Oklahoma oil explosion.
746 2018-01-24 22:23:55 NATO is a big nonsense.?Turkey has allegedly been a NATO partner for 70 years?Or PKK since when?NATO is an apparatus?Interest only for USA ISIS + YPG are also disposable dishes after eating (oil robbery) is thrown away
747 2018-01-24 22:23:34 Snake Oil Salesmen must stick togather!Wolves in sheep's clothing!Hypocrits &Bigots &Homophobes!

758 2018-01-24 22:22:23 So much fun to read though I am oil fan.#sad
759 2018-01-24 22:22:10 A5: Just cutting down on butter and oil. #Krusteaz #giveaway
760 2018-01-24 22:21:54 have oil in my purse right now :) depends on the situation and the moisturizer I have. After a super scrub shower, I oil my face & go to bed
761 2018-01-24 22:21:48 Read something that really hit me: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Wow. Sometimes you have everything you need right in front of you but not enough will to make it happen.
762 2018-01-24 22:21:40 Wow. I have so many responses but sadly you wouldn’t understand. Think about your comment next time you shop in a store, eat in a restaurant, get your oil changed at a chain, talk to a warehouse worker, a secretary ETC
763 2018-01-24 22:21:39 I be wanting a semi woke, shea butter on the weekdays, coconut oil on the weekends type of nigga but I still get perms. 
764 2018-01-24 22:21:38 Don’t forget that USA is also a major oil producer cause of fracking.
765 2018-01-24 22:21:30 Also, pulled pork for idiots: a picnic shoulder of pork, sear sides in grapeseed oil, add bbq sauce (store bought's fine), water, onions sliced, and brown sugar. let pressure cook in Instant Pot for 90 mins, wallah - you got pulled pork!
766 2018-01-24 22:21:20 You sure you’re not a closet red? The hypocrisy of you lot, wouldn’t have a team without waving the paper. Bought yourself a place at the top table with corrupt oil money. Don’t believe your own hype 
767 2018-01-24 22:21:17 No no no! Shareholder activists have had 20 yrs + to engage Big Oil on climate and enviro reforms. Where are we now? Global emissions ever-rising, last year at record breaking speed. ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY IS A FAILED STRATEGY!!! #NewChant #DivestSF
768 2018-01-24 22:21:16 There’s lots of pros and cons with each paint but you’ll probably want something oil based as water based stuff like snazaroo will just melt off in the Austin heat
769 2018-01-24 22:20:27 I done a 24hr treadmill jog in compression socks, finished, used snake oil, slept, woke & ran a 10k, thought I'd run out of #RealEstate but I #podiumed & shot a pb, couldn't have done that after a 24hr road run, no way
770 2018-01-24 22:20:24 The Pivot King nailed the crude oil entry and almost nailed the first top yesterday and today. I have just started to follow him but his method looks legit and i will continue to follow.   M
771 2018-01-24 22:20:22 Snake oil salesmen must stick togather!Hypocrits &Bigots &Homophobes!
772 2018-01-24 22:20:14 i just use the cheapest one they sell? like tbh i noticed it doesn't really matter. conditioners who are for colored hair are really good i think? i only use german brands so idk but if you use it regularly it will help. coconut oil is also really good!! (only for the hair-ends)
773 2018-01-24 22:20:12 He meant to say the Florida coastal "currency" is different - meaning the dotard would lose money with oil rigs spoiling his Mar-a- Lago view.
774 2018-01-24 22:20:07 Totally agree re: funding, which is why one of our recs to Congress is to provide a dedicated funding stream for evaluation. And I definitely don't assume all innovation is snake oil--but feds have to be able to identify and and not pay for snake oil.
775 2018-01-24 22:19:55 “Changing car oil” 
776 2018-01-24 22:19:39 Petroleum Minister, Bello El Rufai gives free fuel to motorists as he blames oil marketers for economic sabotage.
777 2018-01-24 22:19:25 Im in such a mood i actually argued with the dealership about my oil change. If ya'll know me im passive a/f #nottodaythough
778 2018-01-24 22:19:19 People that only pay $20 for an oil change are blessed!
779 2018-01-24 22:19:15 Some major sectors like oil,power,mst be privatized,and with more or less no regulation by govt excpt competitive market where we have diff players,anything short of that is a waste of tym.
780 2018-01-24 22:19:12 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
781 2018-01-24 22:19:11 The left thinks the decision is an individual one, not a governmental one decided on by ANYONE else. If you don't want an abortion, take birth control or have a baby. Also, tell your male counterparts that commit rape and incest, to stop. That would help. Thanks.

明日やろう
783 2018-01-24 22:19:10 No I got soft hair and a little castor oil in almond oil or something is fantastic for your hair and scalp
784 2018-01-24 22:18:48 didn't wash my hair today because it was looking good for once, but clock me regretting that decision in roughly one hour when it looks like I've poured engine oil over my head.
785 2018-01-24 22:18:45 For years I’ve been upset about paying $60 for an oil change, I drive a fucking Honda
786 2018-01-24 22:18:44 Add a cap of olive oil to your rice before boiling it to separate the grains completely!
787 2018-01-24 22:18:39 All I know is we should still be interviewing and basing reporting on failed internet celebrities and snake oil salesman whose medium is pushing ethno fascism and weaponized hatred, put their faces out there, get them and their messages in the mainstream press
788 2018-01-24 22:18:36 There is a better way,
Illegal Migrants and legal immigrants send remittances to Mexico.
These remittances were $26,000,000,000 bil last year. This surpassed Oil as Mexico's largest source of revenue.
I propose a modest 7% tax levied on remittances.
This equates to $1.82 bil. Yr
789 2018-01-24 22:18:32 I’ll see you there
790 2018-01-24 22:18:27 Hoes outchea changing car oil just so they nigga can play the game?? Yolo
791 2018-01-24 22:18:26 Imagine if the Oilers/McDavid relationship ends like Joe Thornton and the Bruins did, with Connor being traded away and the Oil winning a cup without him.
792 2018-01-24 22:18:22 Along with your Oil Tanker!!
793 2018-01-24 22:18:09 I don’t think it is an issue of pity. It’s a choice. #1
Allow the richest 1-5% to keep for themselves the profit of our society or #2 take some of that profit for healthcare and college education.That’s what Norway did with the profits when they nationalized the oil industry.
794 2018-01-24 22:18:08 Pretty soon,well just have boring baron , dusty dirt with no vegetation from cattle and oil drills
795 2018-01-24 22:17:51 Also a wink and a nod to those who still make big bucks in oil and old school energy sources.
796 2018-01-24 22:17:44 Also oil broke above $65... and $crypto is still strong over 2 months. 

Is the money printing catching up with central planners?
#economy
797 2018-01-24 22:17:36 Wonder what changing the oil on a school bus is like
798 2018-01-24 22:17:28 Hair Currently soaked in castor oil so could use a winter pick me up 
799 2018-01-24 22:16:57 I do hope you beat Oil city.
800 2018-01-24 22:16:55 Granted it’s a marijuana site, the type of smoke inhaled matters. Tobacco, marijuana, wood, meth, plant material, exhaust, coal, etc - I’ll take marijuana over the other choices, maybe as an edible or cbd oil 
801 2018-01-24 22:16:52 Sounds to me like you should be taking applications for male slave to pour the oil on those little sexy feet! Where do I apply :-)!
802 2018-01-24 22:16:50 Even though I walk through the darkest valley,I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Psalm 23:4-5
803 2018-01-24 22:16:46 They're drying now...two oak, one hardened pine, water dyed and then oil stained, then coated with pink metallic and sealed in a hardened sealer.
804 2018-01-24 22:16:44 Why is it that we’re all responsible for our choices & must create our own way, but those with #Millions and #Billions need a subsidy for oil, gas, Amazon plant, GM, and alike? These are the people that use workers as surfs, and refuse to invest in the country they freely use.
805 2018-01-24 22:16:40 With oil prices now approaching $66 US, where are all the analysts and economists who just months ago predicted that oil would remain range bound at $50 to $60 US ?? Collective amnesia much ??
806 2018-01-24 22:16:37 I won't go away. 
 
@Curious97507374

You should go away your superior ignorance and rude uninformed comments belong on an NDP or SJW site ..you grow very very tiresome. We get it you hate Harper, oil and a good economy. Why don’t you move to Ontario and live with your own kind
807 2018-01-24 22:16:36 You may conceive that Turkey was the primary player regarding Syria but the Russian authorities saw their involvement as economic, accepting oil supplies via ISIS. This was bad enough of course, but training & funding of terrorists was via the USA & its allies in the Middle East.
808 2018-01-24 22:16:17 Ack! Rebroadcast: Oil Painting with Eva is THURSDAY 1-4pm. Last post published in error. Sorry folks!

810 2018-01-24 22:16:12 WGN Radio @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @TheRoeConnShow  More than 25 BILLION was WIRED TO MEXICO from the United States Last year. IT exceeds the amount they gross on OIL. Put a fee on this for our Borders! Use our heads! @realDonaldTrump  talked about this in 2016
811 2018-01-24 22:16:09 Capitalism

Capitalism is extinction.

Capitalism is war.

Capitalism is feudalism rebranded.

Democracy is not possible under capitalism.

Capitalism is dead birds in oil.

Capitalism is dictatorship.

Capitalism is Donald Trump.

Capitalism is Rupert Murdoch.

815 2018-01-24 22:15:57 How about a pampering giveaway with a few candles, a few bath bombs, an all-natural skincare set, a body oil, and perfume? I think it’ll be a hit 
816 2018-01-24 22:15:56 i have to melt it because it's solid at this temp (my house is about 55) and then like it hardens into a shell.

nah.

castor oil is very heavy so use with caution.
817 2018-01-24 22:15:54 Does Zidane oil his head? Just asking cuz it’s always shining
818 2018-01-24 22:15:54 Yeah that castor oil WORKS. Add rosemary oil or peppermint oil for extra stimulation of the hair follicles.
819 2018-01-24 22:15:40 Wish Midas wasn’t busy today. Had to go to f’ing Tuffys that tries to upsell $1000+ worth of shit I don’t need done every time. Just change my damn oil like I asked!
820 2018-01-24 22:15:37 Yay more EVs & more oil and gas fracking wells. Fracked oil and gas are significant contributors to climate change; you can't on the one hand continue to release emissions from your wells Hick and claim the adv of zero emission vehicles #greenwash #copolitics
821 2018-01-24 22:15:33 JBCO, coconut, peppermint, jojoba, almond & olive oil are the real MVPs.
822 2018-01-24 22:15:19 Lol, I don't know, castor oil sounds crazy to me.  I am pretty sure noodle has some tough Sicilian hair like me, but that's a first.
823 2018-01-24 22:14:59 Not really , bag of Tandoori Mix , lemon , chicken ,bit of oil , in the oven !!

826 2018-01-24 22:14:41 I love my Rose Essential oil...it never occurred to me to use roses this way! Do you know, is there a kind of rose you cannot use (ie: it’s toxic to humans)?
827 2018-01-24 22:14:35 Oiling my scalp with my homemade oil mix gotta be my fave thing to do.
828 2018-01-24 22:14:29 Love Trudeau but he’s pretty intent on mining those oil sands...
829 2018-01-24 22:14:19 This is completely false. There are nowhere near more solar jobs than oil and gas. Typical propaganda. Do your research people, this is so far from the truth.
830 2018-01-24 22:14:17 2/ Lest we forget America's only real export these days is their bloated Military & the terror needed to justify it. A Military who burns more oil than people!

Isn't it just possible that Russia/NK/Iran/etc are all just made up narratives to keep Americans fearful & complicit?
831 2018-01-24 22:14:14 Canadian oil equities lagging due to deep WCS discount vs WTI. Plus, who wants to invest in Cad oil patch with policy overhang.
832 2018-01-24 22:13:59 Is there a fact anywhere genius? There are a number of ways to pay for the wall. Tariffs, Tolls, Taxes on both services and goods. Such as trucking, shipping Oil pipe lines. Just putting out an insulting tweet proves you have no thoughts. Get a clue.
833 2018-01-24 22:13:51 Trim once a month, coconut oil mask every other week  I dye my hair once a month as well  so I find the coconut oil also helps with dryness  
834 2018-01-24 22:13:41 No rubbing your lady down with coconut oil this year...We on that apricot oil wave
835 2018-01-24 22:13:26 I sleep so peacefully smelling lavender oil
836 2018-01-24 22:13:24 Arsenal sun gamamin komai,God bless Arsenal
837 2018-01-24 22:13:17 I honestly never noticed if it gets clumpy from the cold. Castor oil sounds good too.
838 2018-01-24 22:13:15 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
839 2018-01-24 22:13:13 I’m gonna cover myself in lavender oil and slip my way into my fresh sheets
840 2018-01-24 22:13:12 i think is a good idea

844 2018-01-24 22:13:00 If she’s lookn for growth, thickness and luster. Tell her to massage her scalp with jamaican black castor oil, every couple days. Also  i used coconut oil then shea butter esp on my ends!  It did wonders! Went a whole year.5 without needing a trim!
845 2018-01-24 22:12:55 Scene:bbc news room, mid morning.
'So, oil is going up again, should we do a report on it'.
'Fuck no, we've got a fake fleg story'.
'Oh, OK, Flegs it is then...Jackie, what's that you say? the fleg script is ready to run'.
846 2018-01-24 22:12:39 The @OutdoorRetailer show reminds me of how the Dem elected leaders in this state have allowed it to turn into a fracking wasteland w/ 54k oil and gas wells & rapidly growing; incl drilling near/under homes, parks, and schools; fossil fuels = #climatechange
847 2018-01-24 22:12:29 Trump wants to kill clean energy industries. 
He doesn’t want competition to get in the way of his coal, oil and gas agendas.
848 2018-01-24 22:12:19 It is almost as if this was thought up by the dumbas*es in the Corporate World Order ( the oil companies). The donors to #gop
849 2018-01-24 22:12:19 I just need my oil changed. These folks taking foreverrrrr.
850 2018-01-24 22:12:05 never wear light wash jeans when you hang out with guys that are always doin some truck shit. guaranteed oil, grease, and mud stains within 10 mins
851 2018-01-24 22:12:04 Passionfruit seed oil is rich in linoleic acid and contains up to 75% linoleic acid as part of its fatty acid composition. #naturalskincare
852 2018-01-24 22:12:04 I assume you'd oil me up and massage me in return? :)
853 2018-01-24 22:12:03 Many little processes today, despite a slow start.. that’s okay. Oil infusion (rosemary), hair tonic, beet juice, and a huge supper project from scratch.
854 2018-01-24 22:11:54 96 on oil..wow
855 2018-01-24 22:11:44 i’ve heard coconut oil isn’t very good because it clogs your pores. try body butter, like shea. I would go to target / etc and look at the brand “shea moisture”, it’s black owned and we all know black women LOVE to be moisturized. I use their skincare and it’s great and cheap!!!
856 2018-01-24 22:11:29 Haha the Trukish border is the motor of the conflict. I can remember RT reporting on the Turkish secrect service and the amount of weapons and people were crossing the border. Or Erdogans oil deal with ISIS brought to us by Russian MOD, Dont make me laugh.
857 2018-01-24 22:11:29 i use castor oil for this in winter because the coconut oil gets hard on my hair since my house is too cold. :-)
858 2018-01-24 22:11:19 Hi again now that you can purchase cannabis oil in the UK I wondered if you have tried it and has it been positive?
859 2018-01-24 22:11:14 What this COUNTRY needs is a cleansing plague of the gulf oil spill. Be All You Can Be
860 2018-01-24 22:11:13 Incident 21:36 Small fire in an oven caused by spilt oil, fire was out on arrival and crews ventilated the property #Northampton
861 2018-01-24 22:11:12 I have a few food allergies, so potato chips cooked in avocado oil are one of the few junk foods I can enjoy. I love them!
862 2018-01-24 22:11:05 Bullshit. The Tories led this country into recession from closing mines and the rise in oil prices. They bottled it and called an election. Labor saved us from the shit they caused. Thatcher only succeeded because North Sea came along at the right time. Read a  history book!
863 2018-01-24 22:10:47 oil based makeup removers r best for waterproof mascara in my experience
864 2018-01-24 22:10:34 NOTE: $20B is not the actual number - it is much higher because there are many additional taxes paid by drivers like taxes on car parts, oil changes, tires, insurance, reselling cars, and on and on. 

The link I provided shows data for the 1st item. Use Google to find sources.
865 2018-01-24 22:10:31 Fucked up how wypipo stole and sold all the oil/ rare earth metals from Africa before they were market commodities
866 2018-01-24 22:10:31 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
867 2018-01-24 22:10:25 ( the dough has been cut.) Now watch....( I put a small piece of dough in the oil ). See, it sinks, but....-It’s floating back up -  Exactly. That means the oil is hot enough. Now..( I put a fluffy pillow of pastry on a slotted spoon and set it in. ) Let’s watch out first beignet
868 2018-01-24 22:10:22 Thankyou. I don't think they carry this for cat's Pam. Shampoo only but not the mink oil spray. 
869 2018-01-24 22:10:21 Market looking for risks when it's right in front of them? USD at 3yr low - oil at $70 - after years of waiting for higher Inflation, the US could be hit by a hammer, but not the kind of inflation the Fed will want to see, while global trade and growth may already be suffering.
870 2018-01-24 22:10:15 The norwegian people are so opptimist to the "green switch". But the ministers in Norway aren't doing enough to fight climate change. Because Norway are addictade to oil and gas the country woun't move forward. They need to bet on the futher not the past.
871 2018-01-24 22:10:13 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
872 2018-01-24 22:10:07 and I would add, oil developement is threatening all of us, everywhere. #LeaveItInTheGround
873 2018-01-24 22:09:54 Decided to hit a jay walkin up the street to work. Didnt know i forgot my oil in the crib so now im just walkin around smellin like straight gas

877 2018-01-24 22:09:36 Two biggest GDP producers for Mexico oil (now we produce enough again) remittances (keep deportation high less for Mexico) THATBIS HOW THE WALL WILL BE PAID FOR BY MEXICO!
878 2018-01-24 22:09:36 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
879 2018-01-24 22:09:24 Yeah, I saw she's just trying to make $$ of cpp's like everyone else. She's not very good at her job selling CBD oil. I don't recall asking for her approval of my pain relief choices. Funny how she approves of a Sch 1 drug, but not legal Rx's.
880 2018-01-24 22:09:22 I also like to gather all hair into high ponytail, slather w/ coconut oil, comb through w/ wide tooth comb, clip it up. Let it sit for a while before showering. Shampoo/condition as usual.
881 2018-01-24 22:09:07 A3:  use half applesauce in place of oil. #krusteaz
882 2018-01-24 22:09:00 Did cod liver oil for years but might get back on this regime. Starting to creak a bit! (More)
883 2018-01-24 22:08:58 need tips on how to get rid of blackheads and huge ass pores (and I swear to god if anyone says drink water and use coconut oil I’m going to come through the screen and choke you the fuck out) okaaaayyyyyy reply or dm me
884 2018-01-24 22:08:34 The absolute absurdity of being on the phone with Walgreens district manager while my husband gives me an injection of progesterone in oil in my butt cheek…
885 2018-01-24 22:08:31 i use body shop teatree oil xoxo
886 2018-01-24 22:08:31 Thank you Donnie for putting your oil and coal buddies first. .   Crush any competition that interferes with your cash flow.
887 2018-01-24 22:08:14 Kinda sicken how native Guyanese are allowing Chinese into the country and controlling the oil supply 
888 2018-01-24 22:07:49 City "baulk" at Utd paying out for Sanchez, yet they're about to splash out another 60 Mil (apparently) on another defender. Otamendi, 30, Mangala 35, Walker 50, Danilo somewhere close to that, Mendy also.  We're alright with Smalling and Jones though  Oil = 
889 2018-01-24 22:07:41 Add coconut oil to your popcorn and thank me later

892 2018-01-24 22:07:29 She squandered all the North Sea Oil revenue to push her agenda rather than setting up this country for a secure future. A bloody self serving Witch.
893 2018-01-24 22:07:22 So attempting to boycott a certain fast food joint is funny AF because you could be eating from a different restaurant that cooks with left over oil from previous months or even have roaches in their kitchen
894 2018-01-24 22:07:15 I am a robot. I piss oil
895 2018-01-24 22:07:12 Lets start with mental counseling for soon to be parents. There's so much child abuse that could be prevented.

898 2018-01-24 22:06:50 Isn´t the collapse of currency in countries like Venezuela rooted in major mismanagement of the economy?

Private industry collapsed, a replacement was never built (a cooperative manufacturing industry would have been ), the entire economy was based on oil, oil prices collapsed
899 2018-01-24 22:06:50 Anyone else look at raw rice in hot oil and think they look like little maggots moving around? Or is that just me
900 2018-01-24 22:06:44 I'll be on 5pm PST :) I'll be taking an hour dinner break (not sure what time) but I plan to be on late tonight :)
Feelin' a lot better after some stretching, essential oil rub, a face mask and tea :3
901 2018-01-24 22:06:39 Dunno mate, gonna be a tough one against the oil merchants!
902 2018-01-24 22:06:33 did YOU know Charlies that oil is destroying our planet??????
903 2018-01-24 22:06:28 Have you tried clove oil? It’s  he only thing that numbed strong enough for me.
904 2018-01-24 22:06:24 I like to cook because I like feed people. I like to clean because it's like a meditation. I can sew, do laundry, get out stains, bake bread, file my own taxes, change my own oil, change out my hot water tank, stain furniture after I build it. Men are obsolete.
905 2018-01-24 22:06:23 I use macadamia which is also a sulfate free shampoo and the conditione from the same brand. It's the key to forget about dryness or brasiness 
Also I use argan oil spray when I'm fresh out of shower
906 2018-01-24 22:06:22 What did the idiot Trump think would happen when he put a 30% tariff on solar panels. Killing solar jobs here that employ more workers than coal and oil combined. Don't know how much more MAGA America can take.
907 2018-01-24 22:06:16 Well I say good! I mean did this company have a social license? What do other provinces gain from this? I already got my soup from the US, who needs this? And the environmental risk if there was leak? It’s just too great! It is safer to import from abroad, soup I mean, not oil
908 2018-01-24 22:05:59 It won't make it a full 3 years.
We can thank Mr. Muller for his honest work.
He will turn over every stone that needs turning.
Obstruction &  money laundering of real estate, Oil and more will be exposed.
909 2018-01-24 22:05:52 Weird  I need to check my formula. I’ve been using the pixi rose oil serum and it’s been too oily for me. 
910 2018-01-24 22:05:43 @realDonaldTrump what's going on with oil prices
911 2018-01-24 22:05:31 highly recommend putting coconut oil in ur hair , it’s gr8 i luv it
912 2018-01-24 22:05:28 The squeaky hinge gets the oil.

914 2018-01-24 22:05:23 2/2 BMO: ..#TSX underperformance due to Canada being deeply underweight in surging tech & health care sectors. "In part, it’s a sector-by-sector play, with the U.S. feasting on tax cuts." Also due to lagging Canada #energy sector on

915 2018-01-24 22:04:57 there is a road heading south from Coca in Ecuador indeed cutting through uncontacted lands, but it's in the middle of the Amazon, not near the borderlands. Oil development is threatening uncontacted tribes throughout the Yasuní area

917 2018-01-24 22:04:55 No I take tablets in the morning. Along with my cod liver oil and glucosamine. I rattle when I walk.
918 2018-01-24 22:04:52 If you claim to be for the free market and aren't bothered by Trump using US trade policy to hinder clean energy to the benefit of oil and gas companies, you are not free market...  you're a partisan hack.
919 2018-01-24 22:04:41 Must win for the flames we know the Flames do not stand a chance against the oil.
920 2018-01-24 22:04:34 Nervermind, I get it now. You are just trying to make $$$ off pts like everyone else, only you are selling CBD oil. Here's a tip: Don't make judgments when you are only promoting your own agenda, pls. You'll probably sell a lot more.
921 2018-01-24 22:04:26 Yes, they need to pay a global carbon tax at the pumps cuz the price of oil is low and it's reflected in our food, like meats, prices, which are also lower...
922 2018-01-24 22:04:24 @Jack_Septic_Eye You can also plant the blood oil in an exterior growbed to have for any future use.
923 2018-01-24 22:04:19 A3: Use applesauce instead of oil to make the make the dish more healthy #Krusteaz #Giveaway
924 2018-01-24 22:04:18 And I'll bet oil wasn't even mentioned, was it?
925 2018-01-24 22:04:10 Seriously.
They should be all in w/cooperating so investigations could end & they could get back to screwing poor people & stealing my tax dollars to pay big oil and pharma. But geez, now the dirty russians in line and they want payback. So much pressure! aw, sad lil' #Traitors
926 2018-01-24 22:04:09 A3 like to make healthy breakfast bars with bananas or applesauce instaed of eggs and oil #healthyish
927 2018-01-24 22:04:03 Soya is also the major component for what we call "vegetable oil" as well as heavy use in cosmetics. More crop for burgers will exacerbate climate change

929 2018-01-24 22:03:46 Up next, Chippendales claim they were molested at a women's only party. The Chippendale was forced to wear certain clothes and he was forced to take them all off....He was then forced to cover himself in baby oil whilst rabid women pawed at his naked body.

939 2018-01-24 22:03:16 Congratulations to @Arsenal on making it to the League Cup! Kick the crap out of Oil Money FC for all of our sakes!
940 2018-01-24 22:03:09 The only good thing about Aberdeen today is the oil price soared through $70 and stayed there.
941 2018-01-24 22:03:03 Might find @GuerinSports has the best oil, special guest appearance by public demand.
942 2018-01-24 22:02:53 Oxygen treatments alkaline diet cannabis oil, tell them to try these things instead of chemo beucase these are proven to work and chemo is a fail 93% of the time

Just waiting for the FT undercover team to look at ladies only nights
948 2018-01-24 22:02:28 Sure.  But #evals cost money.  That's not provided for by Congress, which means the intention to use these as experiments is not serious.  Assuming all innovation is snake oil is counter-productive to progress for both students and #highered institutions.
949 2018-01-24 22:02:18 Surely @Agent200 and @JSLTan will fire up the special oil for a BGP 40k play tomorrow on the first call!

966 2018-01-24 22:00:16 For better for you Baking substitute some of the oil in your recipe for applesauce or other puréed fruit.

970 2018-01-24 21:59:55 My point is that Abramovich injected over a billion to make Chelsea who they are today. It is not sustainable when you face Man City who are backed by an OIL STATE.
971 2018-01-24 21:59:54 Fracking is dangerous for our environment, water and economy. In 1969, Santa Barbara oil spill spewed 4.2 million gallons of oil into the ocean.  Oil spills are dangerous especially now that we are turning ocean water into drinking water.

975 2018-01-24 21:59:28 I've been getting an oil change all week but tomorrow for sure because I'm exhausted right now
976 2018-01-24 21:59:27 Ok. I’m going to heat the oil and start the beignets. Wanna get Alex up and come help? -I’d love that. - ( we get Alex back into his chair and we go off to the kitchen)
977 2018-01-24 21:59:26 This reminds me of when that lady rubbed a bath oil that just happens to be concentrated enough for your whole tub on her body and when it stained her skin she blasted lush
978 2018-01-24 21:59:19 And even if it did, solar provides a FRACTION of the energy that oil and gas and coal provides meaning that more employees with less output IS A WASTE OF VALUABLE RESOURCES.
979 2018-01-24 21:59:19 Canada lost Nova, Petro-Canada, Imperial Oil, and got replaced by foreign interests, largely from USA. USA went from 75% of our exports to almost 90%.

We lost our sovereignty - the O&G industry is a symptom of the problem, not necessarily the problem itself.

986 2018-01-24 21:58:15 Hey everybody...@now1solar thinks the Oil and Gas and coal industries employ less than 23,000 people.  O&G currently has 180,000 employees and coal is over 50,000 which is 230,000 which it TOTALLY less than 23,000 in global warming math.
987 2018-01-24 21:58:09 And of course now I have to replace my car brakes...all I came in for was an oil change 
988 2018-01-24 21:57:58 Sure. Show me your facts that Trump has helped in any way at all, is it all the other store closings (coincidence, perhaps?)  How about tariffs on solar energy to ramp up oil use. Maybe you want to post a chart on gun violence. Some things are pretty obvious, kid. Wise up.
989 2018-01-24 21:57:58 Whenever someone provides the actual cause of a problem you either shit on their punctuation or how they've worded it.

Care to back up your claims that the Embargo by the Number 1 economy in the world isn't crippling Cuba or that the oil prices haven't screwed Venezuela?
990 2018-01-24 21:57:58 yeah sucks when I call a $3 oil move, lol
991 2018-01-24 21:57:55 that might have happened inadvertently. You may know that Idlib is still receiving free of charge electricity from the government as we speak, while the SAA is fighting these bloody terrorists.. Actually 90% of crude oil needed by Syria since 2012 has been...
992 2018-01-24 21:57:53 If you were to tell me based on real life experience that what I'm selling doesn't work that would be different than saying you don't  "believe" it does and therefore it's  snake oil.
993 2018-01-24 21:57:41 I’m just wondering why it takes 2 HOURS to get an oil change at Honda 
994 2018-01-24 21:57:36 Oil meet water
995 2018-01-24 21:57:24 It's definitely decent for the price, oil based finishes better than dulux for me
996 2018-01-24 21:57:20 In part but look deeper- gas, coal & oil is a much bigger deal to Trump & Company.
997 2018-01-24 21:57:13 And buy into phony non-evidential homegrown snake oil remedies like "Link and Place".
998 2018-01-24 21:57:11 *buys an essential oil diffuser* wow I really have my life together

1004 2018-01-24 21:56:30 The solar industry employs more Americans than coal and oil combined. This tariff will pretty much eliminate 23,000 American jobs a year.

1014 2018-01-24 21:55:45 From a solar co. Employee  on the 30% tariff by Trump on solar panels "virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year."
1015 2018-01-24 21:55:34 @AlexandraSCWH so when are we going to go to that nude beach? :) You can just lie back and let me oil you up and give you a massage. :)
1016 2018-01-24 21:55:33 We MUST get these science nay-sayer clowns out of office! Their only concern is their oil/gas businesses & subsequent money that goes into their pockets. They care nothing re air degradation for which they are responsible. Guess they don't have to breathe the polluted air...
1017 2018-01-24 21:55:29 Aye Wenger In you bitches. Come on you gunners beat those oil bastards in Feb!!!
1018 2018-01-24 21:55:23 Many years ago I sold solar. It was expensive back then, unsupported by govts both state & fed. I celebrated when Carter put it on the roof of WH, and then watched Reagan pull it down. No one seemed to notice. Carter also cut foreign oil dependence by a third! No one noticed.
1019 2018-01-24 21:55:22 I've been where you are.  While I shared that sentiment, I had to look for other natural remedies.  CBD oil, aka hemp oil, is a great pain reliever, unless you can get them to write you for marijuana ( you are in Cali).
Look up Gerstein Therapy, heals nearly anything through diet

1044 2018-01-24 21:53:04 Russia, Saudi Arabia not worried about U.S. oil boom
1045 2018-01-24 21:52:55 to every guy that works at a car dealership: we get it you get to drive nice ass cars for 20 mins & clean them then drive your crusty ass honda civic that hasn’t had an oil change in 50,000 miles when you’re not at work so you don’t have to put it on your story to flex
1046 2018-01-24 21:52:48 Seems only 14% of the cost of a solar installation in US is manufacturing. The Trump tariffs will hurt solar more than help in US. Even some US solar cos don’t manufacture here anyways.  I wonder why such a strong industry would be knee-capped? For oil & coal?
1047 2018-01-24 21:52:28 To be fair, the US has a hefty stake in the oil industry, as well. The gov't is run by ex pharmaceutical and oil executives. Now, the thin veil separating the public from blatant corruption has been disregarded under the security that most in gov't are being revealed as evil.

1051 2018-01-24 21:52:08 Unadulterated drivel. The economic argument, even ignoring oil, was sound. The continual lies and propaganda from unionists, eg, loss of pensions, out of EU, was what swung the vote

1087 2018-01-24 21:46:53 Oh get a grip!  Makes me laugh, oh the outrage!  Check out the financial services industry, oh and banking.... oil and gas!  To name but a few industries left behind.  Equality!  Right....

1097 2018-01-24 21:46:01 No doubt she is disappointed in total. Prob hoping for an even 5 mil. Horrible person.
1098 2018-01-24 21:45:55 without regulations, idk about all companies, but some will do anything to make more money. iirc even with regulations in place things like with oil drilling companies ignore regulations and safety recommendations because the fines/costs to them are not significant when
1099 2018-01-24 21:45:54 Hope you put them on the spot for providing 15 of the 9/11 terrorists.  And for exporting radical Islam around the world, while the west buys their oil.  As well as numerous human rights abuses.  Oh wait, this probably didn’t occur to you.
1100 2018-01-24 21:44:54 He didn't say "oils were a new invention". He said ".... Tubes of oil paint. A new invention that allowed artists to come out into the landscape." Pretty clear to me that he was referring to the portability of oil paints in a tube. That was an 1840s invention.
1101 2018-01-24 21:44:49 Dr. J has prescribed young Whelan some turpentine and castor oil, but the rascally fella jist won't bite! Might be time to leech him.
1102 2018-01-24 21:44:42 That’s because he gets too much money from oil and thinks they should be made here
1103 2018-01-24 21:44:31 Well would you look at that....time for another oil change already

1110 2018-01-24 21:43:45 Worth noting that the US natural gas production industry  has been decimated by cheap saudi oil. Not seeing any calls for help there.  We just exploit the cheap oil while we can. Seems very clear what the intent  of this decision was, given Trumps past actions and current staff.

1142 2018-01-24 21:39:19 Alpine is good, but do you ever have issues when the oil starts to get low? They feel clogged when low. Hard to hit.
1143 2018-01-24 21:39:08 Yes. It is stupid to eat Tide pods. It is also dangerous. Because it is so stupid we can mock it by showing oil in a car and calling it chocolate or antifreeze and calling it Mountain Dew. But without a show of hands, who is glad we did our teenage stupid before phone cameras?

1228 2018-01-24 21:30:00 Nothing like not having a job in Portugal, living a shitty existence while a few rich ppl are enjoying all the oil money and Portuguese imports in Angola, or worrying about a mine from a long ended civil war maiming me in Mozambique

1230 2018-01-24 21:29:38 did you make them in the oven? Home made cut potatoes? I'll give you a huge tip for that: parchment paper underneath, and they won't stick!! Oil em up first in a bowl, then put on the sheets on the pan. PogChamp!

1236 2018-01-24 21:28:29 They were rich because they were socialist. They declined because their economy was dependent on oil, and when the oil price fell, their economy fell.

that allows them to pretend there are no revenues flowing from this!
1239 2018-01-24 21:28:13 The ultimate Snake Oil Salesmen!!  Gullible people..
1240 2018-01-24 21:28:05 Any excess was wiped off, gun oil slathered in the insides with a small rag. The gun was formed again, Jesse raising it to aim; good as new.

1242 2018-01-24 21:27:44 Being from Texas, I hope we can turn this entire state BLUE. With gerrymandering & voter suppression, I don't know if we can. But I'm sure going to do all I can to get rid of the oil & tax scam loving bigots who are in control.
1243 2018-01-24 21:27:40 K don’t need your lips to swell friend  I should have enough pigment to remake with just castor oil
1244 2018-01-24 21:27:30 One of the absolute highlights of my former career as a magician wanker was having a legit quote from Mark E Smith on my gig posters. Always an unintelligible conversation to be had over a drink in The New Oxford or Lamp Oil. Quite gutted this evening.
1245 2018-01-24 21:27:30 @RTLZ Foei, "ZDoc meevliegen met de piloten van EasyJet"... Vertaling "oil level" wordt "oliepIJl".. Dát kan dus echt niet.

1250 2018-01-24 21:26:51 Thank you! I owned a scooter 10 years ago, but sold it for double my money during the gas/oil crisis. Always hated that I'd done that. This is a well built Vespa clone for about 1/4 the cost of a Vespa.

1254 2018-01-24 21:26:42 Houston is an oil town with solid family and jobs. Houston isnot a pot smoking, coffee town that is supposedly “hip.”  Houston is unique. Embrace its uniqueness not try to be like the “cool kids.”
1255 2018-01-24 21:26:32 Never had to really notice b/c I always go to Walmart for a oil change but to get good oil & a good filter, a oil change is expensive

1259 2018-01-24 21:25:33 Cause we are capitalist and know anything the government touches is a waste. Private markets can do better, oh ya and we are not Norway with oil reserves and only 5 million citizens. Nothing in declaration of independence "GIVE ME GOV RUN HEALTH CARE OF GIVE ME DEATH!"

1266 2018-01-24 21:24:44 Castor oil nope. Jojoba? I'm not all that sure since I never use it alone. Lol
1267 2018-01-24 21:24:37 Yeah,  locust beans. My younger brother uses iru and palm oil to cook his noodles sometimes
1268 2018-01-24 21:24:31 Because she wanted to be a yellower bone....so since now the melanin skin is trending I'm sure she's gonna grease with oil or black polish to be melanin too.
1269 2018-01-24 21:24:13 Getting my oil changed and this chick is PUFFING on a cig in the car bay, like oil and grease ain't combustible. #WeAllBoutToDie

1272 2018-01-24 21:24:01 'Stealing Van Gogh' on BBC2 . @AndrewGrahamDix actually said 'oils were a new invention' ... shocking .. @AndrewGrahamDix knows as well as I do, oil paints were around since the Renaissance. Even if 'tubes of paint' were fairly new.  The programme is a mess of approximation.

1277 2018-01-24 21:23:42 Wait now. When the kids say Bougie, is that short for Bourgeoisie? Did the kids just take French word A, replace it with French Word B, and then call B slang for A? Wait. Did the pope just say fake news? There's an oil spill in Asia? Goodnight, folks. Wednesday was hard.

And a lot of low lying poor countries...

1372 2018-01-24 21:13:08 From that last RT: "Though our society is powered by petroleum and lubricated by oil, it floats on water. Our society is a vessel in its own right. It is a lifeboat carrying us all over water toward the future."

1376 2018-01-24 21:12:38 Is the Q2 expectation of a lower oil price a departure from your earlier, and quite recent Q1 projection, Josef? In other words, is the lower price expectation now set for later in the future than originally suggested?
1377 2018-01-24 21:12:26 Or maybe she is just full of it?
1378 2018-01-24 21:11:55 Up for the CEOs of the coal and oil industries bc I'm not.  I know they're greedy.  I was referring more to the employees that may not have many job options in their area and can't afford to move and go without a job until they find another one.
1379 2018-01-24 21:11:52 Its not reasonable to expect 50+ year olds to go back to school and work at McDonald’s to support their families. Thankfully Trump is reversing Obamas ridiculously stupid plan to put coal miners, oil and gas industry workers, out in the cold.

1408 2018-01-24 21:08:41 In 2000 Iraq did drop the USD in their oil transactions to "break US monopoly in oil trade". They were invaded three years later.

1412 2018-01-24 21:08:01 if 加油 means to add oil does that mean I can start setting things on fire :D

1414 2018-01-24 21:07:40 Having a foreign car all fine & dandy until you gotta spend over $100 for an oil change, an arm and a leg for a tune up, or something else goes wrong and costs thousands of dollars that would cost an American car 50

1416 2018-01-24 21:07:09 Next time you might boil them but not all the way (like 1-2 minutes less), then lightly coat them in a spiced flower mix and then fry them up in a butter/oil mix in your pan. The flower will give them a light crust.
1417 2018-01-24 21:06:52 And while I wish we didn't have to use coal and oil as much, they are the cheapest most convenient resources by far compared to many very expensive alternative forms of energy.  And least those people have jobs until energy resources and their jobs can be prominently replaced.

1422 2018-01-24 21:06:25 Thanks for sharing!  Various groups are looking at these oil exposure cardiotoxicities across different species including human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes which is really interesting to see how well conserved these mechanisms are.  Are y'all looking at tuna cardiomyocytes?

1434 2018-01-24 21:05:05 Intresting, Norway did invest serru mutch under Obama. But the last year we stoped investing in oil, and we sell stocks now. Insted er invest in Tesla and solarpanel industry.  You now increas tax on this industry. And we will invest in other contrys insted.
1435 2018-01-24 21:04:27 I hated #brussels #sprouts but made a good recipe to make them tasty. Take 16 oz brussels sprouts & shred them, put in big bowl, add 2 tablespns olive oil, 1 tsp each of salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder. Toss til blended, microwave 7 minutes. Add seasoning as desired.
1436 2018-01-24 21:04:11 Ehhh...  It's normally not bad but the moment it gets cold it greatly affects taste. But you can always see if your Long John Silver's may taste better after they change oil

1438 2018-01-24 21:04:07 That's kind of exactly it. Most of the things Venezuela would have had to do to dodge the oil curse would have required effective and determined state intervention, which is exactly the kind of thing most modern critics would call, uh, socialism (even if it isn't necessarily).

1482 2018-01-24 20:58:13 One complication with estimating Venezuelan output is the diluent used to extract heavy oil, which is then reexported in the resulting blend. So if you go by tanker tracking alone, you might end up with a higher number

1505 2018-01-24 20:55:57 Knows as a credible journalist @HamidMirPAK invited 3 PMLN members in @GeoCapitaltalk to bring @pmln_org internal conflicts in public. The purpose is to put oil into flames 
1506 2018-01-24 20:55:40 Cherry Picking? Up 460m oil&gas but down 3900m (exc oil gas) so net down 3440m
1507 2018-01-24 20:55:33 Wow..another good reason to add them into my smoothie..Dr Rhonda can you look into Pulling with coconut oil? Plus the possibility of Pulling with CBD infused coconut oil or would be counter intuitive because you don't ingest the oil...thanks in advance
1508 2018-01-24 20:55:33 Okay.. I’m done with palm oil...
1509 2018-01-24 20:55:15 No, your main priority is working for your buddies in oil industry. Resign now
1510 2018-01-24 20:55:06 We won’t be able to afford a US made solar system for our home. We’ll end up paying higher cost for oil to heat our home in N. Dakota. Very disappointed.
1511 2018-01-24 20:54:59 #GlenMoray 2010 Peated PX Finish Taste: Dry smoke and engine oil initially, the tangy fruit and spice make a return on the mid-palate but not to the extent of the nose, in the background is a malt sweetness providing depth

1514 2018-01-24 20:54:43 let the tweet be shared i like smoked turkey sandwiches with little mayo, lettuce, salt,pepper and American cheese with oil, oh and i use scott tissue only. 
1515 2018-01-24 20:54:22 Exxon and other oil companies are suing South Portland, ME, for passing an ordinance saying no tar sands. It's costing the town a fortune, but the pipe the oil companies' would use is old and passes by a large part of the state's source of drinking water.
1516 2018-01-24 20:54:09 The next time somebody suggest I use coconut oil as a moisturizer, I’m calling the police 
1517 2018-01-24 20:54:07 Dipping mini mozzarella balls in olive oil because I am a grown up.
1518 2018-01-24 20:54:00 Gotta get an oil change today  I'm finta leave the Truck there n have my bm come get me fuck that shit lol
1519 2018-01-24 20:53:47 @Global_Montreal, Just read your January 17 article on oil deliveries issues in the West Island. Oil tank going dry here in Dorval. No sign of @ultramar on the phone or in the street so far...
1520 2018-01-24 20:53:41 On a high rn. I don’t have any cavities. Lost 11.8 pounds. Plane tickets bought to see my family for my birthday weekend. Taxes filed. Getting an oil change.

1522 2018-01-24 20:53:28 The collapse in global prices has resulted in a 96pc plunge in Scotland's North Sea oil revenue, new data has shown. Oil revenues tumbled from £1.8bn in the 2014-15 financial year to just £60m in 2015-16, according to Government figures.

1525 2018-01-24 20:52:31 In other words: Do Saudi Arabia’s bidding. USA carrying water for the Wahabi’s oil yet again.
1526 2018-01-24 20:52:26 Thank you for helping to grant the wishes of these truly courageous kids!
1527 2018-01-24 20:52:20 So what does gender equality look like in the banking industry?  Probably very different to say, the offshore oil drilling industry.
1528 2018-01-24 20:52:09 With the move above $66.00 in March, it is fair to assume hedge funds are now more than 95% net long oil.  The CFTC report next friday (Feb 2, 2018) will reflect this.
1529 2018-01-24 20:52:06 Still no oil......
1530 2018-01-24 20:51:56 Coconut oil is actually wonderful on my skin
1531 2018-01-24 20:51:55 My car takes the most expensive oil they fucking have 
1532 2018-01-24 20:51:31 Not saying much there. Daddy was a snake oil selling, tent preacher.
1533 2018-01-24 20:51:24 thank you maddison!! i have calming essential oil that i loveeee!
1534 2018-01-24 20:51:17 I remember that shit, Ch.9 used to play them on the weekends.  Didn't some of the aliens come out of oil drums ? Like Return of the Living Dead
1535 2018-01-24 20:51:17 Bio Oil is THE BEST stuff to put on your nails after removing gels. Works a treat for putting the moisture back into the nail.

1538 2018-01-24 20:51:09 In case you thought the USA had the lead on idiots falling for political snake oil, the UK is dealing with people convinced that completing Brexit will pay them a dividend.
1539 2018-01-24 20:50:57 Go support city then.. or Paris... They have, and do, everything you want. If all you want is us to jump ownership to some oil giant, buying success without foundation and to sack klopp for some trophy mule.. then you don't represent the spirit of shankley n are not a fan.
1540 2018-01-24 20:50:49 Yet another false narrative by the Washington Post. In fact, #JerryBrown has expanded fracking onshore in CA. His administration has also expanded offshore oil drilling by 17 percent, approving 238 NEW offshore wells. Yet the Post will not touch the big story here. #unfrackcal
1541 2018-01-24 20:50:34 $/CL so oil end up doing its thing of going which is good.  Now  look to see if the move gets reversed at end of the month.  So far a bit of negative divergences.
1542 2018-01-24 20:50:31 Dem was the days ... scrubbin' our porches on our knees an doffing our ats to social betters, you know the likes of Rees Mogg. And don't forget gallopin' polio an TB, usin' olive oil as a laxative an not as a condiment, an we won da war!
1543 2018-01-24 20:50:28 only use coconut oil when you’re going to sleep! during the day it’s bad for your skin b/c bacteria gets trapped in it

1545 2018-01-24 20:50:00 I'm not saying low cushing = no oil in the world today. I have been saying wti needs to reconnect with global crudes. Its doing that way of spreads and wti-brt arb today and over past few weeks.
1546 2018-01-24 20:49:56 I got some castor oil yesterday so I can start healing. I ain't know what it was for a while...
1547 2018-01-24 20:49:49 yeah, surprising since banks doing ok and well, what about oil??
1548 2018-01-24 20:49:43 Pan frying anything with oil is a fucking battle, like yes bitch I did IN FACT burn myself multiple times for this
1549 2018-01-24 20:49:36 Woke up at 6am, I worked out, bowled, typed out my philosophy paper, and did an oil change on my car...nap well needed....
1550 2018-01-24 20:49:33 This is all dwarfed by oil revenue of course.......and we are a service economy because of what the Tories did to manfacturing.
1551 2018-01-24 20:49:32 My new year's resolution is to eat healthier for my heart and HBP. Eating just vegetables/fruits every other day drizzled with olive oil (not fried) heart healthy.Also all kinds of nuts, cooked dried beans,wild caught fish,greens.
1552 2018-01-24 20:49:26 Ditto forever – Vinegar and oil on my potatoes, let my meats be dry but egg free.
1553 2018-01-24 20:49:18 Tulsi. Do you know what else these countires had in common. STOLE GOLD & Iraq,libya wanted to off the BIG OIL GANG federal reserve bank note & implement a gold standard currency. No federal reserve bank; syria, nkorea, iran, russia. Russian CentralBank holds $73.6 BILLION in GOLD
1554 2018-01-24 20:49:16 North Sea oil gets a slight mention as it ‘boosts’ the economy but U.K. is a net importer of oil.

1558 2018-01-24 20:48:38 I made my first pie crust subbing coconut oil for butter, in the crust. It was THE BEST CRUST I ever made... and I learned to make crusts while working in a commercial bakery. ^..^
1559 2018-01-24 20:48:35 @JustinTrudeau should push for CDN oil instead of buying oil from countries that oppress women.
1560 2018-01-24 20:48:28 The oil reserves of whole Cyprus is being stolen by your Greek Cypriot government.The rights of the Turkish Cypriots on oil reserves are illegally being taken away from them.Why dont your president,Anastasiades discuss this issue with Turkish Cypriot politicians???
1561 2018-01-24 20:48:05 my mouth has become so much healthier since i’ve started oil pulling
1562 2018-01-24 20:47:48 So I’ve been waiting for my oil to get changed for over an hour and this dude just brought in Popeyes and the smell is so overpowering I want to be his friend just to have some food
1563 2018-01-24 20:47:45 
1564 2018-01-24 20:47:43 Where can I get some “Wild Growth” oil from?
1565 2018-01-24 20:47:41 Yes Parabola is spreading hopefully that US Dollar can find support and that will fix oil's run.
1566 2018-01-24 20:47:40 Bro u should tell ur friend Heisenberg to go dancing elsewhere maybe in natty. But not in oil since everybody is in @steve_scherr
1567 2018-01-24 20:47:35 yes but would need to add a second tank as starting cold with oil will damage the cylinders
1568 2018-01-24 20:46:51 Well... you can microblade but want to give vitamin e caps a try first? Use the oil from a capsule every night before you go to sleep. Make sure you use sunscreen though in the morning. You should see quite a difference.
1569 2018-01-24 20:46:48 Getting off of oil and $$$ (ugh), Mexico City, I just returned, and it was really awesome.  I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness, order, and public art.  I've seen much of the world, but it was a shinning urban location, to me.  It's no Cape Town, mind you!  Your fav?
1570 2018-01-24 20:46:46 That's all for now. Not listing all but everything looks good. Im looking for more opportunities in oil, nat gas even and maybe more staples. Stuff no one really likes or forgot about. Will update tmrw or later in the week. xo

1572 2018-01-24 20:46:24 and the constant policing of what's vegan and what's not. like palm oil???

1575 2018-01-24 20:46:02 DOW Jones is telling us something here. A big war, or no oil anymore, perhaps an apocalypse, or a worldwide decease.
1576 2018-01-24 20:45:51 I sneak shots of vegetable oil whenever I can.  Goes down SMOOOOOOTH.
1577 2018-01-24 20:45:46 Blend 3 cups dandelion greens with 2 quarts daily bread. Mix in Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve with chili
1578 2018-01-24 20:45:37 I'm also a weirdo cat lady OBVIOUSLY, & for whatever reason the peppermint oil smell chills them the fuck out & makes them sleep at night rather than violently wrestle as noisily as possible for hours.
1579 2018-01-24 20:45:36 He spent all of that money on the outfit and nothing to moisturize that hair?  fruits, berries, coconut oil, Arian oil... something
1580 2018-01-24 20:45:31 $VPRB... no official news release last 6 months but quarterly report out soon.. new products being launched, multiple sites say out of stock, dilution ended, strong support, upside surprise catalyst from company.. otc listing upgrade in works, sells to both pot and oil sector

1584 2018-01-24 20:45:18 Given most of the uptick in domestic production occurred when oil prices were above $100/barrel and oil hasn't hit that mark since then, I don't remember that.
1585 2018-01-24 20:45:10 Sergio trying to strike oil using Soares x Sporting nearly 1 year to the date he put 2 past Patricio at the Dragao in a Liga victory.
1586 2018-01-24 20:45:04 Why is it when they call you up after checking your oil or tires they mention that you should do this soon or your battery is blah or your breaks are about to go.... WHY DONT YOU FIX IT NOW??? Why are you telling me this after you said I’m all set!?? #wtf #carproblems
1587 2018-01-24 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1588 2018-01-24 20:45:00 They drove my truck into the shop to change the oil. Now it will not start. That is textbook definition of an unsuccessful oil change.
1589 2018-01-24 20:44:43 I'll buy an argument that for strategic reasons we should subsidize solar manufacturing here so we're not dependent on China for panels as we are to the middle east for oil. But # jobs in factories vs # jobs installing panels seems obviously skewed towards the latter to me.
1590 2018-01-24 20:44:35 oil $66

1593 2018-01-24 20:44:23 Putting coconut oil in ur hair for about half an hour before washing makes it grow much faster and leaves it super healthy, soft and shiney. Also use tea free shampoo and a tiny bit of conditioner after so it doesn’t get greasy easy

1596 2018-01-24 20:44:00 5 male engineers literally just compared how much they can bench press.
Snark: “Bench pressing isn't useful.  How many times can you flip a tire?"
EngineerBro: "Huh? I rotate my tires every other oil change."

1597 2018-01-24 20:43:44 Sol, this is definitely fake news, this is a tanker of oleic acid from palm oil and the Sun article says it is not a precursor of explosives. How about reading articles before you retweet them?
1598 2018-01-24 20:43:39 Alberta/CDA needs to put OIL 2nd & get on board with Renewable a B$$ industry.  Kenny wants to shut it all down & get the OIL Co what they want. BC/QUE figured that out.  When OIL drops they don't care, they are making $$ & creating jobs.
1599 2018-01-24 20:43:32 Truth !!!! And I’d like to add to that who will be able to afford it 3% of Americans!16 ounces of olive oil already costs $30 OK I know that’s just a small thing it’s just I noticed these things it’s interesting! I see with the gift people at the food banks is disgusting and sad
1600 2018-01-24 20:43:29 Oil is increasing but consumer gas is still fairly cheap given the huge supply. Refiners running through crude to get the cracks on distilly and plastics, keeping gas prices low. Lot more room to run 
1601 2018-01-24 20:43:19 I would like someone to prove @realDonaldTrump isn't lining his pockets with the oil biz's  $$$$ after placing these tariffs on solar panels. Anything that can progress this country and sustain it for our children in a healthier way scumbag Trump has gone and done away with
1602 2018-01-24 20:43:17 Joe any idea on the energy sector being red last days while oil ripping hard? Thx.

1604 2018-01-24 20:42:58 Same. Started running an oil diffuser in my bedroom with peppermint+eucaplyptus+lavender as the oils. Helped with my sinuses tremendously. And of course there's always self-waterboarding with the dreaded neti pot but boil it first so an amoeba doesn't eat your brain.

1610 2018-01-24 20:42:37 clove oil and maybe heroin.
1611 2018-01-24 20:42:09 Wheat Thins filled with SUGAR. Triscuits are wheat, oil, and salt. C'mon people, this shouldn't even be close.

1617 2018-01-24 20:41:57 Excellent! To answer Jason's question in his story about the vehicle on the lift, it's on a VW chassis and can be seen in group photo at right end of 2nd row. It delivers smoke oil to air show performers so they can make those trails in the sky when they fly.
1618 2018-01-24 20:41:52 Hell rules because you can do whatever you want there! Go to hell!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1619 2018-01-24 20:41:51 Raising the price of solar panels further enriches Trumps doners in the energy biz. Less solar, more gas, oil, & coal consumption. Follow the money, it always exposes the truth.
1620 2018-01-24 20:41:29 That's how I feel when I see a puddle if oil in the Evil Within.
1621 2018-01-24 20:41:26 So my dad went on a deployment and he came back and was checking the oil in my car and noticed I hadn’t changed it in a year... that’s what happens when I don’t have a guy in my life
1622 2018-01-24 20:41:26 Our energy editor has been talking to the the oil companies. They claim they were worried the Tsunami would be carrying Ebola.

1632 2018-01-24 20:40:39 Thanking the indigenous people for turning up against big oil seems ironic that you voted No to renaming Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day 
1633 2018-01-24 20:40:34 Energy East was intended for heavy oil sands bitumen. Irving Oil is set up as a cracking refinery using light, sweet crude. Bitumen needs a coking refinery...Totally different. Several billion to build. And about 60% of Irving’s oil comes from the US.

1635 2018-01-24 20:40:17 That oil well comment was even worse! Telling a date you hope they don’t run out of money? How about liking me for who I am, not my money.
1636 2018-01-24 20:40:14 Weird. Oh well, get some vegetable oil, methanol, and lye, I guess.

1639 2018-01-24 20:40:03 Did you know that asparagus is extremely good for your heart? Grill or steam lightly, then dress with olive oil and lemon. It makes for a delicious side dish....and you’ll get the added benefit of having it go to work for you to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals.
1640 2018-01-24 20:39:50 United generate own funds, Chelsea owner, billionaire Oil, Gas etc, City owner billions, royal family & state, yet claim moral high ground
1641 2018-01-24 20:39:38 The only thing I hate about getting an oil change at the dealership is the guys greasy hands touching everything inside my car.
1642 2018-01-24 20:39:30 So, it’s education based on ability to pay? As in, if I can’t afford an oil change DIY or do without. Should we also have DIY on roads and bridges less traveled because “I” certainly don’t drive on “all” of them? That would save me some money! Hilarious.
1643 2018-01-24 20:39:23 Whale oil beef hooked. Say that fast. Now you’re Irish 
1644 2018-01-24 20:39:19 22 $ for an oil change ! Hell yeah
1645 2018-01-24 20:39:13 He’s pointing out that an entire industry is killing us. Oil & gas power more than SUVs. What do you drive?
1646 2018-01-24 20:38:59 The January version of myself would like to yell at the June-pack-up-the-classroom version of me. June Debbie threw away the oil pastels January Debbie wants to use!
1647 2018-01-24 20:38:57 Oil. Minerals. Common wealth.
1648 2018-01-24 20:38:55 You got guys making oil-eating bacteria funded by big oil SPECIFICALLY so they can lower safety standards and shit cuz “chill son we got this. The lil homey gonna pick up our trash”

1655 2018-01-24 20:38:07 Good job on crippling the solar industry with your tariff. Now Americans HAVE to buy the oil and coal from your donor buddies.  You earned your keep.

1658 2018-01-24 20:37:38 When you assume office, the oil price was N75/litre but you still sympathize and drop it to an affordable price of N65/litre. Then the oil was not only cheap but available everywhere.

1660 2018-01-24 20:37:30 Stark had been working on a machine. One unlike any of his other inventions. It tackled the subconcious reality of dreams. He only wished that @ASinisterSpirit didn't pick up on it. 

He had fallen asleep by his invention, a spanner in his hand, oil splattered across his brow.
1661 2018-01-24 20:36:58 Or he is just honest that from an investment and export perspective it's quite beneficial to have a slightly weaker dollar. Also makes domestic oil production seem better.
1662 2018-01-24 20:36:53 The states with the highest % of people on “food stamps” are all Republican. This is because coal, banjo playing & incest will not be generating gdp growth. Even oil is an industry selling death that is dying. So your one successful economy, Texas, better diversify economically.
1663 2018-01-24 20:36:51 Somebody just threw a bottle of omega 3 capsules at me. 

I only have super fish oil injuries but I'm lucky I wasn't krilled!

1665 2018-01-24 20:36:29 wait. can I just do this with bulletproof coffee? that sounds way tastier than cod liver oil
1666 2018-01-24 20:36:21 And cuz trump is invested in oil not solar
1667 2018-01-24 20:36:20 Oooo I only like it when I've cooked it with olive oil and garlic salt on top!
1668 2018-01-24 20:36:19 A stranger recognized which essential oil I had on today, and I’ve never felt more known.
1669 2018-01-24 20:36:11 I’m a big face oil fan! Will check out Weleda for face products have only used their body oil
1670 2018-01-24 20:36:05 got an oil change and new work shoes today I am feeling very productive
1671 2018-01-24 20:35:44 I hope somebody is telling Buhari govt that all the economic positives are not as a result his govt's deliberate (in)actions but increase in the price of crude oil in the global market. But hey, I'm sure his boys are saying sweet nothings to his hear.
1672 2018-01-24 20:35:43 Looks like nothing can bring down Oil..))
1673 2018-01-24 20:35:29 Well a few appear to be fish oil/ omega 3... not sure what that’ll do for your immediate health.. 
1674 2018-01-24 20:35:11 Clan boss prices up this industry without even put pressure on oil giants to invest more on renewable industries. It puts California and this industry in disadvantage. this is how trump deteriorating the earth.
1675 2018-01-24 20:35:10 Haha, social networks reporting and a guy sitting in UK are now more important than proper OPCW-investigation? You are a joke and Tillerson should go and drown himself in a puddle of crude oil.  and BTW stop bombing people with depleted uranium!
1676 2018-01-24 20:35:00 Wherever you’re getting service tip!! Wether it’s salon restaurant fast food chain coffee shop oil change bakery smoothie joint, Tip!! It means so much and makes such an appreciated difference.

1678 2018-01-24 20:34:50 I just been so stressed with money. I fucking hate it. I need a haircut, oil change and forgiveness. Not that I deserve it
1679 2018-01-24 20:34:42 How much fish oil are you snorting at one time?
1680 2018-01-24 20:34:26 Or oil market saying that more bbls need to stay in the US?
1681 2018-01-24 20:34:22 Can't see one. It removes the value of the usd as a stable currency in the world. If oil goes to another current or even a basket, that's big trouble. It moves economic Center to Berlin.

There's nothing good
1682 2018-01-24 20:34:20 They have oil.. (petroleum) Sweden has “Volvo”
1683 2018-01-24 20:34:17 Snake oil is everywhere for sure. It's a long game... not short-term. It's about relationships, which take time. But dif goals req dif strategies. Being recruited is dif than lead gen. Most articles are about lead gen I find.
1684 2018-01-24 20:34:15 Now, I this one, I am familiar with. It is a wonderful oil that has a lot of potential applications!

1687 2018-01-24 20:34:09 I’ve put 20,000 miles on my Golf Sportwagen in a year. She had her oil changed for the second time. It was fucking glorious to be told “everything is perfect, you owe nothing, and here are your keys”
1688 2018-01-24 20:34:04 Where are the tariffs on foreign oil and other fossil fuels?

1690 2018-01-24 20:33:56 Elephants in some form have shut down a lot of things in Oklahoma the last few years. Check out our education priorities and our current budget crisis that leaves huge incentives to big oil while hurting renewables.

1691 2018-01-24 20:33:54 I made myself a face oil and slowly but surely everyone I know is becoming just as obsessed with it as I am mwahahaha.
1692 2018-01-24 20:33:53 I bought some fish oil capsules, and it turns out they're strawberry flavored. I have so many questions. Why do they smell like a trout wearing a car freshener? How hard do you have to squeeze the fish to make the strawberries come out?
1693 2018-01-24 20:33:45 Did the #CRYPTOCURRENCIES fans the chart analist check how #USD #Oil #Silver #Gold #US500 is behaving this last weeks, does that tell you anything? When stockmarket starts to bleed you will see moon in cryptomarkets and it will not take long. Contradict me if i am wrong
1694 2018-01-24 20:33:45 Inevitably there will be disease outbreaks and people will die, it’s simple, mad cow disease, bird flu, and trichinosis, you heard it here on Twitter. Seafood inspection especially after oil tanker disasters seems weak.
1695 2018-01-24 20:33:42 @travisyost would be interesting to know how many extra games Oil would <hypothetically> have won if their home PK percentage was at league average. Only 5 extra wins and they'd be within 2 pts of wildcard. Wonder if all the doom n gloom would be for naught if that was fixed
1696 2018-01-24 20:33:41 Nothing like having Oil shorts in play and watching the price go straight to the moon. But on the bright side, life is Good. #OIL #OOTT
1697 2018-01-24 20:33:38 bye bye cranky old guy who supported fat oil companies
1698 2018-01-24 20:33:37 All money talks, it doesn’t matter where it came from. Oil, American or whatever. Don’t be so petty.

1702 2018-01-24 20:33:27 @japanstomcruise this is like with the hot oil
1703 2018-01-24 20:33:25 There are no more "White House Briefings" just lie after lie, after lie. Either stop broadcasting this snake oil salesman show or call her out and MAKE her answer questions. ....what am I thinking?......I thought we were still in a Democratic America.
1704 2018-01-24 20:33:23 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
1705 2018-01-24 20:33:20 I think it has additives to deal with the lead that diesel engine oil wouldn't have.
1706 2018-01-24 20:33:12 What did you think was going to happen? He specifically said he would impose tariffs on imports and he believes climate change is a hoax. He’s getting paid off by oil and gas so why wouldn’t he kill the solar industry. Your ignorance hurt the rest of us who got it all along!
1707 2018-01-24 20:33:12 OIL DIFF: 4.81 -> 4.85

1711 2018-01-24 20:32:49 There shouldn't be any fracking in California in the first place! Water is too valuable there for this to make any economic sense. Government should price those oil companies out of business!
1712 2018-01-24 20:32:45 Not all that glitters are gold some are actually condemn oil

1716 2018-01-24 20:31:59 Females don't never check their oil. They just put gas in the car and drive.
1717 2018-01-24 20:31:36 good paying jobs in Okla. after oil rig blows -up,so much for deregulations  by the lying Potus!
1718 2018-01-24 20:31:19 Can you guys give us a link or sth to the full video
1719 2018-01-24 20:30:58 It sounds like you have dry skin. When your skin gets dry it will over produce oil. I’m the same and salicylic acid was too drying for my skin. Lush products for dry skin works better for me.
1720 2018-01-24 20:30:53 Baby oil is so underrated!
1721 2018-01-24 20:30:40 I don't F*ck wif  girls that don't av oil wells in between. Do you relate??
1722 2018-01-24 20:30:25 Make sure that your using the correct oil in your engine, or it could affect your cars performance and could damage it.. Unsure?
1723 2018-01-24 20:30:24 I use tar shampoo twice a week (when I wash my hair), and super rarely coconut oil directly on my scalp (dangerous bc my hair is so fine).

1727 2018-01-24 20:29:58 Pavel Molchanov will appear on @CNBCClosingBell at 4:10 ET today discussing stocks to play the oil rally.
1728 2018-01-24 20:29:58 Would love to see some of these young deadly black fullas in data scientist roles as well.  Data is the new oil as Tahu puts it and Aboriginal orgs are sitting on great reserves and need to find ways to mine that information.  Need to decolonise GIS too.
1729 2018-01-24 20:29:40 @mikes_booh

Since 2011, Obama put up with the birthers and the smear campaign was being driven by Russia.

IMHO - Smearing of Obama and Hillary is about 2 things.
1- Climate Change - decreasing need for Russian oil / gas
2- The Magnitsky Act.  Sanctions against Foreign Mafia.

1734 2018-01-24 20:29:12 I know!! Up north especially, oil is used to heat the house! I need to move south! Ugh! Lol!! But thank you!
1735 2018-01-24 20:29:08 Does solar really employ more than oil and gas? Also, are there American made solar panels that would not have the tariff?
1736 2018-01-24 20:29:06 burning the midnight oil at both ends
1737 2018-01-24 20:29:04 Solar employees more people than oil?  
1738 2018-01-24 20:29:00 I like my canned tuna fish like trump likes his porn stars:

1739 2018-01-24 20:28:59 During their 20 minute session, the little guys pumped home 3 power play goals on the Oilers penalty kill.
1740 2018-01-24 20:28:58 If you're serious, try mixing a few drops tea tree oil + olive oil + a little apple cider vinegar. Warm it in the microwave, not too hot, use a syringe with no needle to put it in. It's the only thing that kicked my recurring ear infection that was resistant to antibiotics.
1741 2018-01-24 20:28:49 What a horrible statement. If anyone is to blame it’s CNN for being the snake oil peddlers they are. I’m sick of their lies and bias!

1743 2018-01-24 20:28:41 Up here in the north they do! And to fill it it cost 350$ and just filled it that much less than a month ago too. I need to move down south! Away from the cold! Oil is used to heat the house ):

This nonsense all started with you guys interfering in places you werent wanted- odd they all had large oil fields though.
1751 2018-01-24 20:27:22 She’s your baby and you’re going to do what you want. I let Tristan cry it out or I put him in his swing. He loved the swing and it helped him sleep. Also, maybe a defuser and some lavender oil will help her calm down and sleep. #AmazonPrime
1752 2018-01-24 20:27:12 Love dropping a chicken fry in the fryer and getting hot oil splashed on me
1753 2018-01-24 20:27:09 Yes Spin, Plenty of "Snake Oil Sales People" on Fin Twitter. Be Very careful who you "Listen" to. Most are Clueless, IMO
1754 2018-01-24 20:26:56 I need to get my oil changed soon
1755 2018-01-24 20:26:40 There were such laws once in USA;when were they revoked,"dark1970s"?Ppl so consumed by price&availability of oil,earlyNAFTA bankruptd family farms&threwUSfarm families of150+yrs out on streets penniless in broken down cars,farmers suicides,ppl failed notice what govt doing...

1766 2018-01-24 20:24:52 In closing, folks will be excited-if there is something to be excited about.
You can’t expect baba vekumba kwangu to be excited if he gets home, apa ndakasunga zidhuku, zambia shwi, I am smelling of cooking oil, yuk!
But if i create the conditions, shower, heels, lipstick... yes!

1772 2018-01-24 20:23:24 Weird that in an environment where rape is rampant according to leftists, women would seek to be closer to the rapists. Lib logic

1774 2018-01-24 20:23:16 @andiware Cut tofu into 1 inch cubes. Fry in 1/2 tbs coconut oil on med. heat until bottoms are crispy golden then, fry until tops are crispy golden. Don’t worry about sides. Then take off heat and mix in desired amount of teriyaki sauce. I use soy vay veri veri teriyaki brand
1775 2018-01-24 20:23:04 No. The U.S. is exporting oil, NOT freedom. The U.S. should be helping other countries become independent from non renewable energy instead they are trying to make countries slaves to it.
1776 2018-01-24 20:23:03 Who do cheap oil changes

1780 2018-01-24 20:22:13 Most of the time I literally just slice it thinly fry it in olive oil and salt&pepper, and some lemon juice. Add creme fraiche and you have a nice pasta sauce!
1781 2018-01-24 20:21:47 #Oil at 3 yr highs as the #Dollar hits 3 year lows. Inflation/weak Dollar directly hurts hard working #Americans because of these type of price hikes at the gas pump. While big money want to jack up oil prices to make another billion, the small guy gets hurt.
1782 2018-01-24 20:21:47 *FIRS gen. N4.03 tr in 2017

*Excess crude account now @ $40 bl

*Perhaps oil revenue N7 tr

*Govt was even requesting to barrow some money 2 buy arms 

*No subsidy, no social security, no salary @ St level, nothing

Modern economics is very confusing. Huge income, huge suffering

1786 2018-01-24 20:20:53 The dollar is THE most important currency in which raw materials - especially oil - are traded in. Lower pound has proved a huge boon to exports. You really need to stop fighting yesterdays battles. It's boring.
1787 2018-01-24 20:20:42 Shale is producing (for 50%of it) oil with API way above 40... Unfit for producing middle distillate and of dubious quality! Export stucked at around 1.4 million bar./day are proving there is a quality issue for most of it!
1788 2018-01-24 20:20:41 @YoungLiving2011 can l order from you? I’m trying to buy some earl grey oil, but the stores closed in Portland.

1794 2018-01-24 20:19:49 Oil for your house? What kind of oil? I didn’t know houses took oil??
1795 2018-01-24 20:19:35 If you don't like it don't use it, it's that simple, I love oilsand, we get the oil, clean the sand, and grown more trees to absorb the CO2 and produce more O2. What a smart life. Good wins.
1796 2018-01-24 20:19:28 The fact that he wants to put a tariff on SOLAR is beyond despicable. The entire world will surpass us in reusable and clean energy sources, while we kill ourselves & the planet with oil & coal. But that MF will be rich AF.
1797 2018-01-24 20:19:25 #Gas and #Oil prices move higher, oil hits highest seen since Dec 2014, closing up $1.14 to $65.61/brl, moving higher after hours. Avg reg gas price in L.A. now $3.31/gal, .20 higher than month ago @KNX1070 @CBSLA @MottekOnMoney @KilduffReport @GasBuddyGuy
1798 2018-01-24 20:19:24 The elitist policy of weak dollar higher oil prices continue to take hold. As $70 is becoming the new $40 mean price for black gold.

1809 2018-01-24 20:18:22 Is Mr. Market erroneously lumping all Canadian oil companies together? There are a number of them that don't produce heavy oil (which is supply-constrained) yet they are suffering just as much as the ones that do. Isn't the market supposed to be efficient?
1810 2018-01-24 20:18:19 An oil barrel is 159 liters, is 42 US gallons, is 35 UK gallons, is a tierce, is not used to actually measure anything since crude oil is sold by weight.
1811 2018-01-24 20:18:12 Oil or watercolours?
1812 2018-01-24 20:17:51 I think oil can still rise another few dollars as the Saudis will do their hardest to ensure they get top dollar for the Armco float scheduled for the latter part of the year but after the flotation oil will probably fall back to $40 as electric cars take over. @zakstraderscafe
1813 2018-01-24 20:17:46 In addition to removing tariffs, solar should have the same tax benefits long enjoyed by oil & gas - exemption from passive activity loss rules, exemption from alternative minimum tax, etc.  Put together a single bill to #savesolarjobs
1814 2018-01-24 20:17:30 Seriously though it is mindless 65 WTI and record production like a wetdream for oil companies and letting them hedge here - look at $SLB $HAL $GE earnings all clear that production will explode too

1820 2018-01-24 20:16:58 Faith knows. I used to hide the vegetable oil on her when she used to call over, cos as we all know, Americans love going into other peoples domains and taking their oil!
1821 2018-01-24 20:16:52 While the rest of the world seeks to move on to renewable energy America is hellbent on staying dependant on oil & trying to resurrect coal because they aren't thinking of our future just how they can get richer right now
1822 2018-01-24 20:16:50 Pregnancy has dried my face out so bad! I just bought the Drunk Elephant whipped cream face lotion and I mix it with Fresh Seaberry facial oil at night and that seems to work.
1823 2018-01-24 20:16:43 I have a small bottle of tea tree oil. I periodically take it out of the box, unscrew the lid, smell it, replace the lid & put it back in the box. I'm comfortable with this.

1830 2018-01-24 20:15:58 Sitting at the mechanic and I was  this close to paying full price for a synthetic oil change. Then I remembered  Groupon!  That $65 turned to $40 real quick!

1833 2018-01-24 20:15:30 $CPG is not a heavy oil producer and does not sell WCS. My question to you is, why are Canadian oil companies like $CPG that produce LIGHT oil (both in the US and Canada) trading near all-time lows when WTI has doubled? It doesn't make sense.

1879 2018-01-24 20:09:46 When BG was acquired with oil at $30, the ME countries were pretty much bankrupt. The price fell to $27 a barrel end of January 2016 I think - I wrote an article on Finance Magnates around that time. If the price fell a few more dollars the Arabs wd have had to sell global assets

1891 2018-01-24 20:08:47 Obviously there is significant disbelief in the oil rally. I think we hit 70s on $WTIC this year and keep it. Maybe they wake up later and the catchup to reality will be violent. Or I hope :)

The price of crude oil futures settled the day at $65.61. That is up $1.14 or 1.77%.
Earlier in the day, the inventory data showed a surprise drawdown of -1071K. The private API data last night showed a sharp rise in in…
1895 2018-01-24 20:08:14 @McClellanOsc Tom, some time ago u had posted a chart of crude oil COT and price with commercials usually being on the right side. Do u still have a link to it? With COT off the charts and WTI exploding, wondering what the lag is for the commercials to be proven right eventually
1896 2018-01-24 20:08:14 @barronsonline WTI is almost at $66 and $CPG and other Canadian energy names that produce light oil (not heavy) and do not have issues with pipeline capacity are still near all-time lows. How is this not a leading story? Opportunity of a lifetime!

1899 2018-01-24 20:08:12 I use a cream moisturizer and vitamin e oil on top. It’s light enough that it doesn’t make my oil skin super messy, but moisturizes enough that I avoid getting any of the dry patches I use to get on the edges of my face.

1915 2018-01-24 20:06:44 It'd be nice if news orgs used "cannabis oil" in heds instead of "medical marijuana," if it's actually "cannabis oil" they're discussing. To do it the other way reeks of a clickbait-and-switch.

1918 2018-01-24 20:06:26 @WSJ @jimcramer WTI is almost at $66 and $CPG and other Canadian energy names that produce light oil (not heavy) and do not have issues with pipeline capacity are still near all-time lows. How is this not a leading story? Opportunity of a lifetime!
1919 2018-01-24 20:06:19 Oil companies have had good runs recently. Check out #Halliburton (up over $12 in last 60 days) and #Schlumberger (up more than $16 in last 60 days). Watch for a buying opportunity. #oil #Stockstowatch #commodities

1921 2018-01-24 20:06:04 Was in a fireman's house recently and it was said that no oil based paint should be kept in the house as its like keeping a gallon of petrol  in the house.

1928 2018-01-24 20:05:28 That is really well put. 2 years ago they traded hall when that team had Been decimated all year by injury. This year (not as much injury) but worst forward depth makes me wonder if the knee jerk reaction this summer is to move nuge for pennies. It's a scary time for oil fans.
1929 2018-01-24 20:05:27 *FIRS gen. N4.03 tr in 2017

*Excess crude account now @ $40 bl

*Perhaps oil revenue N7 tr

*Govt was even requesting to barrow some money 2 buy arms 

*No subsidy, no social security, no salary @ St level, nothing

Modern economics is very confusing. Huge income, huge suffering
1930 2018-01-24 20:05:11 that’s weird you can’t send it in to a place to collect for oil spills - seems they’d like to have it on notice!

1939 2018-01-24 20:04:36 As long as we're putting a tariff on solar panels, how 'bout one on foreign oil as well? Gotta protect our nascent fracking industry...

1941 2018-01-24 20:04:15 J: China has the ability to destroy demand for oil as I shifts to natural gas and tech development. Look at major Asian markets for demand.
1942 2018-01-24 20:04:15 Why are your property taxes going up in ND? Why did the GOP lower the oil Extraction Tax? Who does the GOP care about the most?

1967 2018-01-24 20:01:12 Too bad they didn’t listen to all those people trying to tell them he was a liar. I’d feel bad but we’re all spending our energy trying to save #DACA and #CHIP and National Parks and stop oil drilling on our American coasts and everything else the guy THEY VOTED FOR is doing
1968 2018-01-24 20:00:57 But, #America1st, and #bringingjobsback...that's what the #Dotard said, right? 
Or is it that he doesn't like the competition?

He may hold the title, but he's no president.

1983 2018-01-24 20:00:17 but seriously - our lab used to be an auto shop in the 40s and the pit was where they used to change the oil. It's been cleaned out well since then but it would still smell a bit dank any time it rained. Hoping this will solve that problem.

* Increases customer bills
* Brings KwHr price closer to OIL/COAL

1993 2018-01-24 19:59:26 Get some black Jamaican Castro oil
1994 2018-01-24 19:59:22 Yes! It is!  That tariff is an awful lot of money!  30% means many businesses will go under.  The oil & coal companies are happy! THey do not want reusable energy.  This is a criminal act! It really is.
1995 2018-01-24 19:59:19 No. Because political opponents get to frame the solar power tariffs as a gift to "big oil." Nobody cares about "big washing machine."
1996 2018-01-24 19:59:04 No stream today guys. I've got some issues with chest/breathing right now, when I talk it sounds like I'm gargling oil. Have to see a doctor before more #content.
1997 2018-01-24 19:59:01 I scrubbed using cool water with St. Ives Apricot.. Sprayed some tea tree oil on a slightly wet cotton ball and spot treated for the burn.. few sprays of Rosewater.. Then I moisturized with Aloe Vera and Coconut Oil. Face hydrated asf now 
1998 2018-01-24 19:58:54 Yeah, honestly I probably shouldn’t have posted it on there. That’s just all I could picture with them kids sitting on the bench. No issues with the community aspect of the team. Top of the rung in that category.
1999 2018-01-24 19:58:49 what should cushing be in todays export focused production world ?   low cushing stocks doesnt mean there is no oil ...
2000 2018-01-24 19:58:42 After years of massive underinvestment there is no other way than to start spending money on it, esp. in the face of strongly rising demand. Im really curious about the outcome here, this divergence cannot last, OIH/XOP lagging behind oil rally by massive amount last months.

2009 2018-01-24 19:57:55 Seperation of something lol - oil a lot to do with USD
2010 2018-01-24 19:57:51 Its a new law that gives more power to the regions! Do not accept import of oil and gas from countries with poor environmental regulation. If Quebec chose clean local gas, then Alberta has to produce even cleaner gas and oil! In this way Quebec could be a role model
2011 2018-01-24 19:57:44 Olive oil is great. I used grapeseed oil this bc that’s what I had in the house. The article recommend castor oil. As long as it is a pur’n’kleen (lol) oil. I’m trying almond oil for my next batch

2015 2018-01-24 19:57:05 Your staff offered me chips as a gluten free option and laughed. I asked if they were fried in the same oil as the fish and pointed out that  they could not be considered gluten free. Their attitude was ignorant and insulting.
2016 2018-01-24 19:56:59 @cheemo_joe Hey Joe, I feel your pain with the Oil, I got out of the @LAPA_MEG AGM and turned on CHED just to hear the 3rd Sabres goal. :(
2017 2018-01-24 19:56:47 It's a garbage dump, under-performing economy, and the state of the average Russia is constant despair, alcoholism, and increased nationalism....... So, great, I guess.

They don't "make" anything or export anything beyond gas or oil really.

2021 2018-01-24 19:56:15 Many electric utilities already use solar.  Now they'll have to pay extra for new foreign panels.  It will bring KwHr cost closer to oil/coal ... it's just what the fossil-fuel industry wants.
2022 2018-01-24 19:56:09 You and I have agreed on this from the beginning

2029 2018-01-24 19:55:20 I don't know much about why we are at war but it's always bothered me that they think they're "fighting for their country" in someone else home! It feels wrong. I'm positive it's just for money and/or oil

Me doing my eyeliner to go get my oil changed: first try is perfect, corners so sharp they cut the Starbucks barista, tarte calls to offer me a modeling deal
2036 2018-01-24 19:54:47 This also would affect electric bills for utilities that produce a large pct. of electricity from solar.  These new plants won't come online for a while; utilities which have to pay extra for new foreign panels will pass the tariff along: it makes KwHr price closer to oil/coal.
2037 2018-01-24 19:54:42 I don’t see the problem with what I said. Loved hearing swear words as a kid. It’s a great thing they are doing for these kids. Never once thought differently.
2038 2018-01-24 19:54:33 My information is that Maersk Mariner is just providing some resupply, it’s not forming part of the search operation. Others have said that the ship has a new oil industry related contract starting soon.

2040 2018-01-24 19:54:11 Today after I got out of the shower I washed my face and mousturized with rosehip oil per usual. My face still felt really dry in my T Zone so my dumb ass put some Jergens with honey lotion on my face and now my skin is super irritated 
2041 2018-01-24 19:53:53 OIL up most P&E's down. $uso UP $Xop DOWN.

2042 2018-01-24 19:53:26 the point is Brian that we need both- promoting diversification doesn’t mean anyone wants to shut down coal. or oil. it’s just recognizing that the future needs other technologies. coal and oil are inconsistent and won’t last forever. we have a duty to provide for future humans.
2043 2018-01-24 19:53:24 Yes, diesel has been slammed; however I don’t see manufacturers busting a gut to introduce LPG powered alternatives. While the oil companies pull the strings manufacturers will continue to dance to their tune.
2044 2018-01-24 19:53:13 we in Ont are paying appox double for gasoline as per my recent visit to Fla.. - “We now send 99 per cent of all of our oil and gas to America, number one, so they don’t have to do anything for it anymore because we have given up our leverage,”
2045 2018-01-24 19:52:59 I could go for some dumplings smothered in hot chili oil right now something serious
2046 2018-01-24 19:52:54 Maybe they need to use peanut oil in the hauler instead od diesel?

2061 2018-01-24 19:51:14 Think about it @VP by wearing the yamaka all you did is inflame the OPEC nation's? Which means the price of oil will probably rise, although I humbly ask the OPEC nations please don't do it, as you're hurting my conservation efforts here in America.TY

2066 2018-01-24 19:50:51 I have this great soap bar (Manna soap) that I use and it clears my skin and also nourishes it - not sure if they ship to the US  though but maybe they have something similar at Lush? It's charcoal and. Olive oil ...

2134 2018-01-24 19:43:47 If you look at the video the rig is set up for drilling and not fracking. I have worked on several land rigs and I can tell by the layout. It is also more likely to have been an oil well and not a gas well as at Preston New Road.

2188 2018-01-24 19:37:52 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
2189 2018-01-24 19:37:52 I only see five kids in that picture? Bradley's a big kid, is it possible Oliver got overshadowed, maybe?
2190 2018-01-24 19:37:26 Don't forget that the right side of 14 was unplayable for the whole summer because of a oil leak #TFP

2193 2018-01-24 19:36:56 DACA is just the first incremental step in amnesty for all. It's no secret.
2194 2018-01-24 19:36:48 From Agriculture -Crude Oil -Taxation. After TAXATION was Next?  Oil boom is gradually a past thing now u people wants to Mine the masses.
2195 2018-01-24 19:36:38 Do you have 35-50% tax as we do? And yes, we have the worlds best healthcare and welfare system. Its the oil and gas that has payed for it! 50 years ago we were one of the poorest countries in Europe! After 50 years of oil and gas, we have the cleanest air on the planet.
2196 2018-01-24 19:36:27 Now now Neil, that's British oil and British whisky from Scotland. Like we all benefit from Britain's financial services in London,  England and British slate from Wales......struggling for Northern Ireland

2198 2018-01-24 19:36:25 Cut off the flow of oil and NK is done.
2199 2018-01-24 19:36:08 Again, why has ALLAH abandoned these people? Oil rich Arab states should be responsible for these people. OPEC wishes that American oil producers join them. U.S. gives the greatest share to UN. Where is allah?

2203 2018-01-24 19:35:38 @realDonaldTrump don't do the tariffs for the solar. You will kill jobs here and a lot of places elsewhere. People here in NM are working with cleaner and cheaper enerhy. Get with the times! Oil doesn't last forever, also in about over 50 years chocolate will be gone
2204 2018-01-24 19:35:38 Jk! Oil tuna is a damn abomination
2205 2018-01-24 19:35:37 This guy hasn’t fulfilled a single promise he made to Cleveland. He sold y’all snake oil, essentially. LeBron is the straw that stirs the Cleveland drink, just look at those 4yrs he was gone and how many of “those people” ventured downtown.
2206 2018-01-24 19:35:28 1. * Our Foreign Reserves have peaked at $40b, the highest level in about four years, and up from $24 billion just a year ago, even though the price of oil had crashed woefully.
2207 2018-01-24 19:35:28 i am sick of being told my job isnt hard. there's drywall seeping into the gouges on my bleeding, oil covered hands
2208 2018-01-24 19:35:24 Definitely please try talking to them. Im much older and my parents were against it as well at first but like my other comment explained see if they'll be alright with you trying CBD oil or a cbd balm that you apply to affected areas, anything that has no or very low THC high CBD

Oh, damn, are we out of cooking oil too? I’ll buy a bottle just in case...
2212 2018-01-24 19:35:01 Lol, that's hilarious!  You're reading only oil media :)

The truth is that Quebec energy is run by Hydro-Quebec, a state owned agency for economic development. They export HUGE amounts of clean electricity to New York, Vermont, etc.

In 2010...

2223 2018-01-24 19:33:58 I don't get it. So what if water tax is higher? I rather everyone pay higher tax on basic things like water, natural gas, heating oil, and gasoline and have the proceeds go to funding healthcare and tuition than to a CEO's bonus. We'd probably end up paying something similar 1/
2224 2018-01-24 19:33:48 I mix a lil coconut, almond, grapeseed, avocado and castor oil
2225 2018-01-24 19:33:42 Does that make the oil cheap, or more expensive?
2226 2018-01-24 19:33:37 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.

Instead of subsidizing billionaires we should be subsidizing alternative energy

2242 2018-01-24 19:31:05 I’m getting my oil changed and I’ve just noticed that their oil comes in boxes. Like wine. But oil. This is amazing to me.
2243 2018-01-24 19:31:01 Nedu, this may not be a fact , recall oil prices rose above $100/barrel between 2011&2014 yet our reserve dwindled , it is about will power to save
2244 2018-01-24 19:30:55 My impression trough media is that the exploration founding will really help Quebec; thousands of jobs, lower energy bills, better schools, the plan against poverty, new roads, a tram etc. Something has to pay that bill. How is importing all this oil and gas making it better?
2245 2018-01-24 19:30:54 Somebody just threw a bottle of omega 3 capsules at me. 

I only have super fish oil injuries but I'm lucky I wasn't krilled!

2248 2018-01-24 19:30:42 Crude oil up strong with weak $.  GOM producers like $APC (61.52) and $EXXI (7.30) should benefit.
2249 2018-01-24 19:30:41 Q: "but why is the government funding tesla. why fund the rich."...?

Tesla, space x, solarcity subsidies: total est $5 billion

Estimated subsidies to american oil: $600 billion...

Q's just working for the people, venturing into solar is a waste, keep subsidizing big oil pls

2259 2018-01-24 19:29:59 @LubricoWarranty NOW I get this info back from you in the mail recently and it says in big bold letters do it your self oil changes are not accepted?!?! This is a big problem. This not what I was promised when I was sold this product and I am not taking my car in for simple..
2260 2018-01-24 19:29:55 The things you can do with olive oil are only limited by your imagination. One of Mother Nature's greatest gifts to her children.
2261 2018-01-24 19:29:46 Oh, well... 'Austin' [said in the tone of Longshanks from Braveheart when the Irish turn on him and he utters a single, rueful word: "Irish"]
2262 2018-01-24 19:29:40 Did you know they pack sardines so tightly in cans because the oil costs more than the sardines?
2263 2018-01-24 19:29:38 No. It’s a stupid conservative talking point that answers nothing to the question at hand. The conversation is about CEOs and high ranking people in large corporations, none of which are manual labor jobs, and you say “What about garbage men and oil drillers?!” ...what? 
2264 2018-01-24 19:29:34 Honestly, I'm not even gonna look again.  *makes sign of the cross* I imagine it's motor oil though.
2265 2018-01-24 19:29:27 The Islamic republic is an existential threat to Iran and its viability as a nation state. Iran will be like Syria whether we like or not if someone does not intervene. The oil is declining and almost 96% of Iran is under sever drought. Time to wake up before everything is looted
2266 2018-01-24 19:29:24 Can Tight Oil generate free cash flow in years to come? Is  #Growth overemphasized then #value ? Is it too sensitive to #OilPrice to generate reasonable positive #cashflow ?

2267 2018-01-24 19:29:17 Finally got an oil change..
2268 2018-01-24 19:29:15 Strongly disagree, this is the only kind of tuna I get. Especially if you can get the stuff in olive oil.
2269 2018-01-24 19:28:45 I am fortunate that my GP doesn't drug test me anymore. She did once and now she's like "I trust you, the only problem with you & meds is you don't take them often enough." CBD oil is supposed to be legal - they sell it at the local vape shop. Missouri needs to just legalize pot.

2276 2018-01-24 19:27:56 Yeah, but this is the US... companies do strange things here.

The car should have visible oil leaks or be burning oil if this problem is there though

2281 2018-01-24 19:27:08 adding to oil short
2282 2018-01-24 19:26:46 Quebec has always had O&G, but deliberately never developed them. It was only when oil hit $110/bbl that the greed kicked in - probably after Katrina in 2005.

So there are two issues: Canada and Québec.

O&G in Québec is not the same as in Canada.
2283 2018-01-24 19:26:42 Put the oil on top

2301 2018-01-24 19:24:46 We get any other way to rise am apart from oil?
2302 2018-01-24 19:24:43 Me too sure is nice too see some of the smallest teams working exceptionally hard!!! You put out alot too place higher. Have too work really hard on suspension chassis etc too make sure there's no issues. Was fun donating too Jordan will again. He needs help also.
2303 2018-01-24 19:24:22 It bewilders me that we can pump oil & gas thousands of miles across countries in pipes yet we can't pump water across Africa to millions of people in drought stricken regions
2304 2018-01-24 19:24:13 Meanwhile, Trump wants a sea wall to protect his golf course in Scotland from rising sea levels.  The man knows damn well that climate changes exists, he is being bought by the oil and coal industries.
2305 2018-01-24 19:23:59 1/ Looks like Cushing is only irrelevant if you don't trade WTI. Unfortunately for those who want to avoid it its hard to trade paper oil today without directly/indirectly trading the US benchmark. #OOTT
2306 2018-01-24 19:23:55 UT-Austin... Cocks not Glocks is their slogan.  You can thank me for the nightmares later.
2307 2018-01-24 19:23:54 Although fewer jobs is the outcome, the tariff on Solar is a quid Pro Quo for the Koch/Libertarian Billionaires "donations". It will be good for Oil and they pretend it will be good for Coal. Screw the environment and the American people.
2308 2018-01-24 19:23:54 Natural gas stocks are now buys but hold off on oil stocks, frack stocks and the offshore drillers. These stocks have lots of downside from here.
2309 2018-01-24 19:23:47 You all know that the Oil playing lousy last night means there's an excellent chance they bring their A-game tomorrow night against Calgary, right?
2310 2018-01-24 19:23:43 No, there's no reason to see hyperinflation as a result of that. The dollar has value because in final equation people need it to pay taxes and bank debts, not because it's used for oil purchases.
2311 2018-01-24 19:23:35 Manual labor around the shop to wrangle the mess. Then maybe oil changes and computer maintenance, tooling, etc.
2312 2018-01-24 19:23:27 They're not just "casting", they're throwing oil to the fire when they absolutely need not.
Look it up if you want more details.

オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
2327 2018-01-24 19:21:43 No worries! I have been in $SIGO since last August! I know they have revenues. Not earth shattering or anything, but considering the tiny O/S and now that they have added Pre-rolls and CBD oil! Potential is limitless!! You don’t want to be out when 3 more catalysts start hitting!
2328 2018-01-24 19:21:38 Economy is as hit as bad as Angola's. Oil made up up to 80% of the gvt revenues so people are feeling it. Making a turn after I volunteer and tour East Africa
2329 2018-01-24 19:21:30 Y’all wanna see how good that tea tree oil has my skin looking?
2330 2018-01-24 19:21:16 So you're proposing full scale nationalisation of the North Sea and the setting up of a nationalised oil company as a way of SAVING public money? Well, I suppose it's a novel contribution to the debate at least...
2331 2018-01-24 19:21:03 Looks like a rag I'd use while changing my oil.
2332 2018-01-24 19:20:46 @DrewNanulaitta uses my olive oil.
2333 2018-01-24 19:20:44 One of you post said who cares about POTUS and FLOTUS this is why.  If we (incl. Melanie) don’t take him down soon this will all be filled w oil rigs or concession stands.
2334 2018-01-24 19:20:40 @caroline0621 made me a coconut oil and peppermint oil mix for my lippies and i really wish i could just bathe in it
2335 2018-01-24 19:20:37 Still maintaining his $48 short position and calling everybody who said oil was going up crazy.  Its not even back to a level of sustainable production yet. Lots of upside left imo. @TSXcapital @ForgeRiver
2336 2018-01-24 19:20:17 A “bit” is not 91% tho. And we have billions of people on this planet. They have to eat something. But meat is not the answer nor is it sustainable. We could stop using oil, gas, fuel, etc and we’d still exceed our carbon equivalent GHG emissions from just livestock alone.

2338 2018-01-24 19:20:04 Oh Mary it’s a disaster. It’s burning oil and the coolant isn’t leaking. Probably isn’t going to last long term

Roasted cauliflower on a bed of lentils, bascially.

But the cauliflower was roasted in olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper & paprika, and parmesan at the end.
2349 2018-01-24 19:19:01 wtf why are people actually putting coconut oil and olive oil on their faces S T O P
2350 2018-01-24 19:18:59 Constantly using my hand sanitizer that smells like tanning oil wishing I was at the beach
2351 2018-01-24 19:18:54 Exactly. Some govts aren't swayed by coal/oil industry $$ so they use alternative energy sources, and then there are others who are swayed and just maintain status quo. Guess this is now a kick in the ass for US to either come up with own solar tech or let it go by the wayside.
2352 2018-01-24 19:18:43 @McDonalds Are your French fries fried in a cooking oil that has beef fat?
2353 2018-01-24 19:18:41 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2354 2018-01-24 19:18:39 What about oil squeezing in that case?
2355 2018-01-24 19:18:12 Why are you gonna put newspaper and then paper towels down to drain the oil off the bacon IN THE ONLYYYYY SPOT THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY HAD ENOUGH ROOM FOR ME TO MAKE ME FOOD ???
2356 2018-01-24 19:18:05 It is so bad man. Looks like I am wearing something dipped in oil for long.

2369 2018-01-24 19:16:51 Sorta off subject but was is your take on pulling with coconut oil and how would it be with CBD infused coconut oil. Pulling is purported to remove toxins (slowly) from the body and greatly improved oral health
2370 2018-01-24 19:16:49 Great #RestaurantWeek lunch @DaviosPhilly today. The wild mushroom bisque w/ truffle oil is not to be missed.
2371 2018-01-24 19:16:48 I am not an expert in history. But I know that much has happened in 150 years. Why will oil and gas in Canada be so much more polluting than in Norway?, you actually have even newer and cleaner technology available. A secured well will be safe compering to farmingfertilizers.

2389 2018-01-24 19:15:24 Idk why tf my grandfather keeps trynna teach me how to change my oil. NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO CHANGE THEIR OWN OIL DAMMIT! Thats what shops are for
2390 2018-01-24 19:15:20 You’re probably still asking that question. Why didn’t you immediately go public? What’s to hide?  Unless the entire Russia crap was fabricated by you. Biden, is a slimy fast taker. Think snake oil.
2391 2018-01-24 19:15:14 Lol its alright if you don't want to be realistic, but how can a country endowed with oil be suffering oil scarcity and price hike for over a month now and the president hasn't uttered a word, how can 73 people be killed and yet no word only to campaign for next election

2393 2018-01-24 19:15:02 Ugh, I'm sorry :( My meds aren't touching mine either. I've found CBD oil helps some though. I even have some in a lotion form!
2394 2018-01-24 19:15:00 100% right: free market gas supply contracts. No more destination clauses and oil linked gas prices

2400 2018-01-24 19:14:28 aye it will....  but think of the result!! and here's a little tip - obvs don't do blue dye straight after bleach, and use some kind of oil or moisturising shampoo/conditioner and your hair will start to forgive you for the abuse 
2401 2018-01-24 19:14:16 Trump doesn't have financial interest in solar as he probably does in oil and coal...THAT'S why.

2403 2018-01-24 19:14:11 I see, I'm sorry it's not helping. The other thing I've heard people try is controversial but some say it helps is CBD oil. It's from marijuana but they remove the psychoactive part THC and its high in cannibidiol so you don't get high. It's purely for pain relief.

2417 2018-01-24 19:12:58 US warned SDF against crossing to Afrin, citing deal with Turkey-I think US allowed Turkey to create a buffer zone out of Afrin. US is trying to hold SDF in NE Syria to protect strategic Raqqa & Omar oil fields. SDF are crossing anyway through government areas.

2419 2018-01-24 19:12:50 Thanks Jonathan. That makes sense and I'm sure it won't be the last time China get slapped with tariffs. Question then is: Dollar-wise how much do we need to shift oil (or even coal) subsidies to make solar competitive? Or is there no appetite for that...?

2464 2018-01-24 19:09:04 I can fathom it. If I made billions from oil and was a sociopath, I would probably also be against renewable energy.
2465 2018-01-24 19:09:01 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
2466 2018-01-24 19:09:00 Imagine what a sigh of relief is coming from Trump's dear friends in the coal and oil industries! Of course these new tariffs have nothing to do with them! Oh, wait a minute...
2467 2018-01-24 19:08:59 Just braid it! Coconut oil is a b to get out but it’s soo good for your hair. I usually do it on a Friday night and leave it in a braid all through the weekend. 
2468 2018-01-24 19:08:51 Trump helping his oil and coal buddies
2469 2018-01-24 19:08:50 Business is not in business to give away free stuff. $250 MONTHLY direct deposit is not a high bar. The returned check fees they rack up?
2470 2018-01-24 19:08:45 If the ministry of The #Word is not strong enough to drill to your call, you may just coast along life until you come under the right ministry and the drill of the word burst oil in the spirit. Everybody has a calling, something waiting to break forth.

2472 2018-01-24 19:08:40 How am i supposed to feel after this Indian man begging me for alms say "go away with this your third world country, a dying oil industry and a trumped up currency"

Hurt or Angry? Told him if he was that smart, he won't be in the "3rd world country to make a career in begging"
2473 2018-01-24 19:08:39 Well, it looks like my car is no longer leaking oil, so that's good news :3
2474 2018-01-24 19:08:37 Crank up the diffuser with some orange essential oil. Nothing like the smell of citrus in the air to brighten the mood!
2475 2018-01-24 19:08:32 How does BIG OIL AFTER their Huge Tax CUTS have the Balls to Raise GASOLINE Prices & the only reason for the increase is BECAUSE  THEY CAN!!!
2476 2018-01-24 19:08:31 More pish David sorry. That was debunked when unionists realised Scotland operates without a deficit and has no need as a successor state to take on deficit or debt from England as it did in 1707. From day one. Norway made 381m more in oil. With less oil. Not just 381m. 381m more
2477 2018-01-24 19:08:26 Sleep, water and tea tree oil has helped my friend, might work for you
2478 2018-01-24 19:08:15 I do eat dandelions, cooked with lemon & oil; #Greek Grandma taught me.
2479 2018-01-24 19:08:05 OK, you win my follow (for what little it is worth) on this one. Can't stand olives, have only recently been able to stomach olive oil.
2480 2018-01-24 19:07:37 Me 10 years ago: The robot apocalypse is nigh. We will be the oil that greases the gears of the machines. 

Me now: AUTOMATION IS LUXURY, YOU FUCKING MEATBAGS
2481 2018-01-24 19:07:37 I’ve been using caster oil on my hair for a week now and my hair already feels thicker and softer. Yasssss

2483 2018-01-24 19:07:29 Give the PAX 2 or 3 a look smaller than the mighty and crafty, but not as small as the rinky dink oil pens everyone has.. and I believe both of those do both herb and oil as well... I may be wrong but those are pretty nice as well I’m thinking of purchasing one actually
2484 2018-01-24 19:07:19 @Bamabroker Hi Bama..  I feel like I owe you an apology. I looked over the charts on both gold and oil, saw the COTs, saw money-flow declining, saw record sentiment 1- sided, and I took the risk.
Me, taking any trade, is the Kiss of Death, I'm afraid..  I'm sorry..  :-/
2485 2018-01-24 19:07:17 You did not buy coconut oil 
2486 2018-01-24 19:07:16 Erykah ain't said nothing crazy. 
There's good in everything. 
If there's only a drop off water in the bucket of oil, that doesn't mean it isn't there
2487 2018-01-24 19:07:15 Only ejuices with cbd. Not an actual cbd oil.
2488 2018-01-24 19:07:06 "our shared interest" cough, cough, oil.
2489 2018-01-24 19:07:04 How is this good? The world is moving towards renewable energy. You do know that oil runs out right

2495 2018-01-24 19:06:33 My oil is new cuz my car was brand new 
2496 2018-01-24 19:06:26 Really enjoyed MEC noon day bible study teachings on “the cloth, the oil & the ribbon “
2497 2018-01-24 19:06:15 Fox con artist trying to sell Johnson’s snake oil. Trump supporters: are you buying this garbage?
2498 2018-01-24 19:06:11 UPDATE!

@HouseNGR, today, passed through third reading, a Bill for an Act to Amend the Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Authority Act, Cap. O5, LFN 2004 to Provide for the Designation and Establishment of Oil & Gas Free Zones in Nigeria; and for Related Matters (HBs. 64, 332 & 400).
2499 2018-01-24 19:06:09 The excess reserve was based on the rise oil price which us above 70$/b more than what was budgeted for 2017 yet the budget performance was below 20%
2500 2018-01-24 19:05:46 上手すぎるっ……けど、後半特にｶｯﾌﾟﾇｰﾄﾞﾙが何を伝えたいのかよく分からん、エフェクトの波は汁の中ってことかな？
2501 2018-01-24 19:05:40 Ack no! BP has had another oil spill!
2502 2018-01-24 19:05:33 New career. Next up is a oil change
2503 2018-01-24 19:05:31 Why does my coconut oil smell like Cheetos
2504 2018-01-24 19:05:30 I be using tf outta coconut oil
2505 2018-01-24 19:05:25 Alternative is paying $12 to cash 1 check which many will do. It's a low bar to meet. #freestuff
2506 2018-01-24 19:05:15 Even the ones who bought coconut oil ?
2507 2018-01-24 19:05:09 olive oil is a sauce at this point
2508 2018-01-24 19:05:04 Let’s be real the dollar has no value but oil. Exactly why they call it the petro dollar. Russia and China hate that the US has so much control. If China decides to give up on the trillions the US owes them the dollar will fall even harder. I see inflation everyday
2509 2018-01-24 19:05:02 #MAGA... @NOW1SOLAR has pointed out that #SolarEnergy employs more people than oil & coal combined. Those who work in #oil & #coal who want their jobs saved can gloat about the suffering of those who are losing theirs.
2510 2018-01-24 19:05:01 Is the U.S. becoming a captive market for the fossil fuel industry? That seems to be the thrust of all Trump policies. Which brings up (again) the question of his tax returns. It's as though Trump is watching the bottom line--his. What's his stake in the oil industry?
2511 2018-01-24 19:04:56 I'm just so grateful to exist during the same time as olive oil
2512 2018-01-24 19:04:26 You can power these on vegetable oil. If it's a diesel. "Borrow" some from that McDonalds you frequent.
2513 2018-01-24 19:04:23 You have an oil well and a distillery on your property?  You're still dependent on getting diesel from a station and then hauling it back and forth on your truck until you come close to running out and then it's back to the station again.  How is that any different from charging?
2514 2018-01-24 19:04:11 But I do think that maximizing our use of various alternative energy sources will reduce our impact on the environment, create new high paying jobs, and prepare us for the time when oil is no longer a viable source of energy.
2515 2018-01-24 19:04:00 Oh please just shut up pogba has same assist as DB in less games even lukaku assists when has aguero ever assisted anyone you maybe top this year but you'll get found out and wont win it next season and we have been more than 12pts clear and you were nowhere to be seen before oil
2516 2018-01-24 19:03:33 Negative Divergences in both GOLD and OIL but is it really going to matter for those trying to short. Could just consolidate sideways then resume uptrend.
2517 2018-01-24 19:03:33 The Iran deal snake oil salesmen.  No one has ever explained how a degree in fiction and NO related experience qualified him for the position he held. Then again his boss was a community organizing pamphlet pusher.
2518 2018-01-24 19:03:31 With WTI-Brent getting tighter it looks like the #oil market is saying it needs less bbls of US freedom over the coming weeks #OOTT
2519 2018-01-24 19:03:29 And you know Ursula must be good at it because I bet she sells her paintings to make money for her lifestyle. All she has to buy is food, paint supplies, and oil for her lamps. Simple life 
2520 2018-01-24 19:03:25 OIL DIFF: 4.73 -> 4.77
2521 2018-01-24 19:03:09 Wait, so how are the loons seeing today's EIA as bullish? There is nothing bullish there at all.
2522 2018-01-24 19:03:08 it's not staged. The only thing is that they edited out most part where people gave the correct answer.
2523 2018-01-24 19:03:06 You don't see women working in oil rigs.
2524 2018-01-24 19:03:04 really? You do oil changes?
2525 2018-01-24 19:03:02 Franklin Graham is NOT his father that is for sure!!! While his father stood by many Presidents, I just don’t see it happening here. When all the other Ex- Prez’s say: this guy sucks.... people should have listened. No they bought the snake oil & circus.
2526 2018-01-24 19:03:00 Or @POTUS has oil shares
2527 2018-01-24 19:02:58 for FLU. Eat raw garlic cloves and oregano oil .. Don't get played by Dr.s "go home and rest" bullshit #flu #fluseason #flushot #bigpharma EMPOWER yourself
2528 2018-01-24 19:02:56 Norway and Scotland of course have entirely different oil fields. If you think there's some magic way to get more tax out of the North Sea without harming investment, by all means tell us!
2529 2018-01-24 19:02:49 Whhaaattt?!?!? I love coconut oil hahah worked on my boys bums and I love it in my hair and skin...hahah you're too funny.
2530 2018-01-24 19:02:42 —if separate species we be—for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world. If we knew what we are, we should do as Sir Arthur Jermyn did; and Arthur Jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire.
2531 2018-01-24 19:02:39 Ah that's great. That's how we manage Claude's arthritis; yumove and cod liver oil everyday and anti-inflammatorys if he has a bad spell. Big hugs xXx
2532 2018-01-24 19:02:38 Hmm... Doesn't the solar industry receive government subsidies already so as to be competitive with oil and gas?
2533 2018-01-24 19:02:37 US does not need any stinking Syrian oil or land. We have plenty of our own. What we demand is for Syria to get civilized peaceful and start contributing to the world economic pie not export radical terrorists.
2534 2018-01-24 19:02:36 I know too! My Muse, my @sennelier1887 oil pastels and my @CanonUSA camera are key tools in this superwoman’s power pack! #mindfulness #focus #unfocus #optimumbrain #neuroscience
2535 2018-01-24 19:02:31 Trump is trying to stifle sales. He wants to do something for his oil buddies that they've never been able to do: restrict growth of renewable energy. 

@JoyAnnReid
@BettyBowers
2536 2018-01-24 19:02:30 idk if you’ve heard of it and it doesn’t have to be expensive but squalan oil!! it’s vegan and made from olives and it’s an adaptogen which means it adapts to your skin’s needs!!! i can direct you to some brands that sell it :)
2537 2018-01-24 19:02:24 Yes just look up the fire that happened at an oil rig due to Trump rolling back safety regulations enacted by Obama.
2538 2018-01-24 19:02:23 ...what does Whore Oil promote?
2539 2018-01-24 19:02:22 went and got an oil change where my friend works and got a discount. i love knowing people

2542 2018-01-24 19:02:07 The reason other countries are much more advanced in solar and other renewables is decisions like these that hamper consumer adoption of these technologies in the U.S., decisions that are aggressively lobbied for by big oil.  This is just ignorant and irresponsible policy.
2543 2018-01-24 19:02:05 Chop the leaves off, rub with olive oil, salt and pepper, roast in oven; amazeballs!

2546 2018-01-24 19:01:44 There is no longer a need to drill for NEW oil off our shores. New technology has led to record US oil production on the mainland! Trump is a Neanderthal for expanding fossil fuels (coal, oil, etc) while pulling the US out of clean power initiatives!
2547 2018-01-24 19:01:39 Never getting an oil change at superlube again

2550 2018-01-24 19:01:19 Can't wait till the United States runs out of it's oil supply. funny enough conservatives would still blame everyone else for how we're behind on other sources of energy.
2551 2018-01-24 19:01:15 Oil was discovered under the North Sea off the shores of Scotland and a country inside the M25 got e exceedingly rich.
2552 2018-01-24 19:01:10 Cooking tip: preheat your pans BEFORE you add oil to the pan. It will help make the surface non-stick #cooking #tips
2553 2018-01-24 19:01:05 Undervalued it seems. The market seems concerned about u.s. supply with oil production jumping last week.?
2554 2018-01-24 19:01:02 Bingo, they're just another lobbyist group, no better than big oil, pharma or NRA.

2556 2018-01-24 19:00:54 Marlon asked for an oil diffuser for Valentine’s Day because he’s obsessed with mine if I have it on he passes out in 5 mins
2557 2018-01-24 19:00:49 Very similar to me and it has to be Kerry gold! I use my oil though
2558 2018-01-24 19:00:47 Rajput's and application of the mind. These two things are like oil and water ...
2559 2018-01-24 19:00:41 @BraveTart - I wanted to try to add a few extra ingredients to your trefoil recipe but I don't know how certain ingredients would affect the bake, e.g. unrefined coconut oil, matcha powder, cardamom, cocoa powder (not all together), etc. Powders/spices = more dry/crumbly?
2560 2018-01-24 19:00:39 Man that sounds like me too. I KNOW my nose gets much more oil than the rest of my face. Thanks Daisy ill check it out today tbh lol. Can you use it everyday?

2567 2018-01-24 18:59:53 Flying status! Wonderful! Just remember it’s fill the oil and check the fuel on it 
2568 2018-01-24 18:59:51 I put coconut oil in my hair yesterday as a hair mask. I washed it out after about 40 minutes, and I thought I did a good job, but it’s SO oily this morning. I don’t have time to wash again it before work 
2569 2018-01-24 18:59:49 A girl had an abortion and couldnt go back home and begged her bf's frnd for her to crash in his place...she bled to death at night. Guy was arrested even his frnd dint bliv he was innocent. Lost his job with an oil company in PH. Went to jail, autopsy
2570 2018-01-24 18:59:49 This is good even after death.  If there is a Muslim section at your local cemetery, the application of Silver Bullet Gun Oil (or bacon bits for that matter) over their graves would instantly send them to hell, regardless of how observant of a Muslim they were during their life.
2571 2018-01-24 18:59:46 Lol that’s my everyday struggle. Still trying to find a good product or DIY to control oil. Will share as soon as I find it. 
2572 2018-01-24 18:59:41 Sorry Rev, but you have no idea as to his talent. Have you ever seen his handmade crocheted toilet roll covers? His oil paintings of a semi nude Dec reclining on a sofa? No. You haven't.
2573 2018-01-24 18:59:29 A Few Good Men is what is needed for leadership; not a horde of pedestrians. 
We don't even need "county govts"; we need exceptionally intelligent & competent managers who will consult with Wanjiku during the day, then burn the midnight oil Thinking about viable solutions.
2574 2018-01-24 18:59:21 _Read the report I linked_.  Direct financial costs of solar & other clean power is now less than that of fossil fuel power - even without accounting for environmental impacts.

Because of that; solar power now employs more people in the USA than coal, oil, & gas power combined.
2575 2018-01-24 18:59:20 $500 for an oil change  come on @BentleyMotors lol y’all killing me.
2576 2018-01-24 18:59:11 $47 + $24 + $12 = $83 spent today.... AND my car needs its 100K tuneup, but an oil change, plus gas, plus something from sheetz. I'm not liking this.... but the big bucks are coming within the next two weeks. TUNE UPS SHOULD BE FREE, JUST SAYING!!!!!!!!!!
2577 2018-01-24 18:59:06 I worked for an Oil & Gas company and there was a convention in London and I organised an evening party there. It went really well. The guests left happy, and the rest of my coworkers decided we should celebrate in Soho until 4am. I was back on exhibition stand st 8am.

2581 2018-01-24 18:58:59 I've been awake over 24 hours and my eyes are bleeding and I'm sitting at the car dealership getting my oil changed and Fox News is blasting in the waiting room and this might be the end honestly.

2583 2018-01-24 18:58:43 Went to the gym for a bit and now getting an oil change. Gonna head home soon and try streaming this afternoon. So I’ll post an update later when I have a better idea when
2584 2018-01-24 18:58:34 Tough being an oil fan lol
2585 2018-01-24 18:58:25 When did Total acquire 25% stake in the Lokichar oil?
2586 2018-01-24 18:58:21 seeing people render pokemon in oil paintings light my motivation into overdrive in order to learn oils,,,
2587 2018-01-24 18:58:02 More than 6,300 store closures have been announced so far this year.   Oil prices climb to $65 a gallon, the highest in 3 yrs.
2588 2018-01-24 18:58:00 As the oil and gas industry continues to grow in our great state, Texas needs a qualified candidate that understands the job! That is why @RepStickland proudly endorsed @ChristiCraddick for re-election! #CampaignUpdate
2589 2018-01-24 18:57:54 $MDR up 12.4% to $8.82. McDermott expects FY18 sales of $3.1 billion to $3.3 B & earnings of $0.42 to $0.52 per share.

2590 2018-01-24 18:57:50 Go in for a $40 oil change....come out with a $900 bill for oil change and breaks. What a day
2591 2018-01-24 18:57:42 Well, Im not a fan of how our govt manipulates it & has propped it so much over the years by forcing everyone to trade their oil using dollars (source of much of our wealth) besides GDP. Its not right so I empathize with other nations but if the dollar goes down, we’re all toast!

2593 2018-01-24 18:57:33 We actually don't have a glut of crude oil. While the U.S. has improved its energy security in the past decade, our net crude oil imports is still around 5 million barrels a day, down from roughly 12 million b/d in 2005.
2594 2018-01-24 18:57:10 u can use vaseline and or baby oil, takes it right off
2595 2018-01-24 18:57:09 I have never built a shelter (but I’ve seen it done on TV lol), but I can start a fire with a flint or starter (never tried without one but always wanted to try). Changing a tire,replacing brake pads, changing oil are all things my mom or dad taught me
2596 2018-01-24 18:57:09 What is your opinion on CBD oil? Would love some input! #cannabis #CBD #healthynothigh
2597 2018-01-24 18:57:00 And then they are not.
2598 2018-01-24 18:56:52 “How DOES rapeseed oil magically turn into canola oil?" First off, Canola was bred from rapeseed to drastically reduce erucic acid and glucosinolates (sulfur-containing compound) to negligible levels. Rapeseed oil does not magically turn into Canola oil. Quit lying to people.
2599 2018-01-24 18:56:48 Its been a decent two days. I got my food and drinks for free last night and i got a free oil change today lol keep it coming
2600 2018-01-24 18:56:45 Come on people wrong post to make your comments on...be better..
2601 2018-01-24 18:56:37 What are some car Maintence things I should keep up with other than oil changes ? 
2602 2018-01-24 18:56:36 Camels with botox...wtf?!? what to do with all that oil money...Its time for the world to change to electric cars...or send me a million or two...
2603 2018-01-24 18:56:31 U.S. government's investments and support of solar have always been dwarfed by direct subsidies paid out to the oil and coal fossil fuel industry, "corporate welfare" that tops more than $20 billion annually.
2604 2018-01-24 18:56:26 Imagine that. A Repub is is in charge and oil prices skyrocket again. Profiteering pieces of shit.

2607 2018-01-24 18:56:18 Lets be honest - Coal 18th century energy - Gas 19th century - oil 20th century - time to move on for whatever reasons I want clean air, water etc - we can argue the reason but I am happy to move away from them - and we are mainly as the solar etc has fallen so fast

Whaling didn't end when we replaced whale oil with mineral oil. It was only when they were nearly extinct (& not worth hunting) that we finally stopped 'commercial' kill
2610 2018-01-24 18:55:37 Mr. @dpradhanbjp You Must have also shared that you are so incompetent that else to #Gas you don't bother at all! You must have shared also that your #OMCs refine #Crude_Oil in #India & take Price from other countries! That's your methodology,let the world know! @UPPTA1
2611 2018-01-24 18:55:24 Oil climbs above $65 for first time in more than three years
2612 2018-01-24 18:55:20 According to my boss, Mexico will "pay" when we add a 1 dollar per barrel tax on oil that we buy... From them? 

I usually stop listening after the first sentence...
2613 2018-01-24 18:55:18 That's exactly what Trump wants to do for all his oil buddies.
2614 2018-01-24 18:54:51 There's a long term war atm for drinkable water. Ppl think it's oil.

2618 2018-01-24 18:53:47 Get it trimmed up and keep it. Next on the shopping list it beard shampoo and oil.

They het around the world telling us to switch off our AirCons! 
2622 2018-01-24 18:53:26 @bulletproofexec I love your XCT and BrainOctane. Prior to jumping on @bulletproofexec, I was old school keto and coconut oil. This is superior however, my goodness is there a pronounced acclimation period :)

2625 2018-01-24 18:53:15 Afghanistan was near Iran and Iraq (countries that supplied America with oil). As a reaction to the invasion in 1979, Jimmy Carter decided America would not take part in the Olympic Games in Moscow.
2626 2018-01-24 18:53:00 She just wants u to keep using that coconut oil thing tbh
2627 2018-01-24 18:52:51 You use the most cheep cheese ever, it's not cheese actually its processed oil with cheese powder. 
2628 2018-01-24 18:52:21 Mmhn and then for oil control what can ppl use???
2629 2018-01-24 18:52:16 Mr. @dpradhanbjp You Must have also shared that @PetroleumMin & his @HPCL @BPCLimited @IndianOilcl don't have a correct #Price_Determination_Mechanism as on date & you have a magical Stick to seek #Crude_Oil prices even on Saturday and Sunday's to fool Consumer's @wef @EPDFIndia

2631 2018-01-24 18:52:03 I’m waiting in an oil change at Walmart and this is the most bored I’ve been since 2009.
2632 2018-01-24 18:52:02 Can’t talk that slick shit to a can of oil

2638 2018-01-24 18:51:03 Yeah and we will take control of all taxes raised in Scotland including the 70% per barrel of oil that currently goes to the Treasury
2639 2018-01-24 18:50:49 There were other factors for sure. But Shale was/is the biggest driver as it turned oil from being scarce to plentiful.
2640 2018-01-24 18:50:45 Not all longs are out buddy. Still holding 80% of my non-leveraged portfolio in gold, silver, miners. Took a small silver long leveraged position yesterday. My oil short “leveraged” is painful to look at the red 0’s though...but not throwing in towel yet.
2641 2018-01-24 18:50:45 My hair gets progressively bigger throughout the week when I wear it down. I went to get an oil change and the dude asked me if I was a neo-soul singer so we’ll see where I end up by Friday.

2648 2018-01-24 18:50:24 And that nigga y’all love to RT who got that freshly oil sheened clip on beard is the worst one of them all!
2649 2018-01-24 18:50:14 Oh BULLSH*T!  The oil industry has LIED for a century about burning fossil fuels, in the same way big tobacco lied about it's products. @NOAA @ScienceMarchDC @newscientist @rdfrs @neiltyson @womensmarch @EPA @SEIA @LIVE_COVERAGE
2650 2018-01-24 18:50:09 With oil at $65 you'd think someone might be catching on.  Of course, the falling dollar is somehow giving cover to all this.  I have to wonder... Where is the Wiemar Threshold?

2653 2018-01-24 18:49:52 Same reason we’ve always been there, OIL.  We aren’t energy independent yet and probably won’t be in the foreseeable future. Then there’s the arms sales, Boeing planes etc.
2654 2018-01-24 18:49:51 U.S. oil production is now at 9.9 mln bpd - we're not far from that all-time record of 10.04 mln bpd (again, that's a monthly avg set back in 1970, whereas this is less reliable weekly data) #OOTT
2655 2018-01-24 18:49:49 Nigerians...when you pronounce OIL where do you guys find Y or E?
2656 2018-01-24 18:49:48 I can't believe what refiners are able to get away with what they are caring for gasoline and distillates given the price of #oil. Citizens are paying the equivalent of $110/barrel of oil...Headline... oil is only $68 Brent. #WTF

2658 2018-01-24 18:49:17 Hi Louise. Moroccan Oil will definitely help. It will keep your hair looking glossy all day 
2659 2018-01-24 18:49:12 Fish oil and other fishy stuff (like actually fish and sardines). Apparently tumeric powder is also healthy for them. Again the biggest thing I have seen is the CBD oil. Oatmeal shampoo really helped my boy, but I want to do monthly oatmeal baths for extra help.
2660 2018-01-24 18:49:11 I have some Cbd oil that might help. I can share a little bit with you and give your liver a break.

2664 2018-01-24 18:48:24 in fundamentalist school it was emphasized that one capitalizes God as in the monotheistic deity who says we can frack all the oil out from under the poor people but that one does not capitalize the g in gods as in something something racist imperialism
2665 2018-01-24 18:48:22 Unplanned global outages coming back onstream played a big role in 2014 too. They magnified the relative impact of tight oil growth. @WMALHittle knows loads about this.
2666 2018-01-24 18:48:13 They wouldn’t be any worse 
2667 2018-01-24 18:48:05 Is ‘olbas oil’ an option?...
2668 2018-01-24 18:48:03 Apples, honey, aloe and flax seed oil
2669 2018-01-24 18:47:47 But think of all the oil we get to use!!! 

2670 2018-01-24 18:47:44 One of my flatmates thinks rosemary increases your memory so bought essentially oil and has been bringing a cloth soaked in it to every exam. Now everytime I smell rosemary I get a little twinge of anger about his stupidity
2671 2018-01-24 18:47:33 I have one coming through, I’ve resorted to baby teething granules and clove oil.
2672 2018-01-24 18:47:21 i'm smart huh??? where are the fucking words YOAV, where are they???? why can't i write worth shit???? why didn't i wash my hands adequately after cutting hot peppers and get chilli oil on my skin huh????
2673 2018-01-24 18:47:19 Since I started this business I have gained control of 90% of all the Oil Companys.
2674 2018-01-24 18:47:09 Tea tree oil solved all my problems lmao
2675 2018-01-24 18:47:07 Unfortunately when you have an administration that does NOT believe in science, is in the pockets of oil company they don't care an out green energy. Go public..most don't know about this tax....

2681 2018-01-24 18:46:44 Chili oil the best

2691 2018-01-24 18:45:38 Read the whole thread. We don’t have the patents to build them. Your nativist instincts are actually wrong and your "simple" idea hurts tens of thousands of American workers AND the future of renewable energy AND U.S. independence from oil.

2701 2018-01-24 18:45:05 Same here, and some cities have banned wood stoves. Norway & Quebec have similar geography/cultures, but you have more geothermal.
That's a whole other debate. :)

More importantly, we have to put more money on public transport. The oil friendly governments have gutted transport.
2702 2018-01-24 18:45:05 That feeling when you're about to sit down for dinner but you accidentally smash a bottle of sesame oil... that ends up everywhere... and needs to be cleaned.   
2703 2018-01-24 18:45:00 Yes with the pure coconut oil

2705 2018-01-24 18:44:57 96% of UK oil and gas comes from Scottish waters, fresh water to North East and West and power, May already stated she hoped an indy Scotland keeps the pound to allow easier balance of payments cross border.

2708 2018-01-24 18:44:29 Trump only cares if our adversaries like him. He believes they have the oil and the money! Russian, Saudis, AE, China, etc.
Those polls show he has ruined US! 
2709 2018-01-24 18:44:07 We only use external testing facilities for our essential oil and product testing, Stefanie. This process verifies that our oils are pure, free of any residue, and contain all the components needed for them to be powerful and effective!

2712 2018-01-24 18:43:48 Well, you LOOK intellectual! I have that same sweater that I wore skiing once and oil from the lift dribbled down onto my shoulders. I covered by telling everyone that it was an accidental spill whilst changing the oil beneath my Lear jet.

2714 2018-01-24 18:43:42 @michaelgivensjr  Jobs, jobs jobs RT @NOW1SOLAR: As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss (1/2)
2715 2018-01-24 18:43:37 Yes I’m so beneath the MAGA crowd. You enjoy paying for his vacations and golfing and legal bills. Also the wall since you fell for a snake oil salesmen.
2716 2018-01-24 18:43:37 the coconut oil i give him alot but not sure if it significantly helps....he likes it at least lol
2717 2018-01-24 18:43:25 But...but...but, they'll have oil! That's all that matters
2718 2018-01-24 18:43:14 Honestly in this life, no matter how useful you think you are, you'll never be as useful as organic virgin coconut oil
2719 2018-01-24 18:42:57 Just needed an oil change Our temps are pretty steady today though!

2724 2018-01-24 18:41:50 I am currently looking into coconut oil and CBD oil for my pibble boy for minor allergies, dry skin and anxiety. Again, lots of research and trusting your gut and vet. I hope some of these help! (:
2725 2018-01-24 18:41:41 take fish oil & biotin pills! it'll be grown in no time  just in time for Virgo season

2731 2018-01-24 18:40:43 It's good that I didn't sit around to wait for the auto shop to do the work on my vehicle. It's now early afternoon, & I haven't heard back from them yet. However, in total fairness, I did tell them to also go ahead & rotate the tires as well as change the oil.

2742 2018-01-24 18:39:33 So, u think PMB will be able solve the problems of the country and Nigerians in eight years? As a country we have three refineries, and we have been producing crude oil and gas for over 50 years and yet no light, no fuel and u are here blaming PMB

2747 2018-01-24 18:39:21 wellll. today has been productive so far! oil change, new windshield wipers, got my eyebrows diddd. now i’m home cleaning & doing laundry.
2748 2018-01-24 18:39:18 It works great before and after using oil, it just depends on the look you're going for. Using it before the oil gives more of a sheen, and after the oil locks in more moisture. Most times, people use it after so they can get the most out of their oil.

2754 2018-01-24 18:38:13 Hated by establishment? Majority of his cabinet are millionaires and billionaires. He appointed Wall St bankers and oil CEOs. This is not hyperbole.
2755 2018-01-24 18:38:05 Well he's got to look out for and line the pockets of his buddies in big oil and coal somehow.

2759 2018-01-24 18:37:36 I believe that it is not the people who make oil, but those who refine it who will change the business

2763 2018-01-24 18:37:25 @AliVelshi My sister loves to remind me that it was the oil and lumber industry that outlawed cannabis, as it had a place in producing fiber for clothes & lumber products and fine oils for burning and cooking. and a great tobacco.
2764 2018-01-24 18:37:01 I mean duh but also whatchagonnado, it's voting for president, people tried to do something different and now we have a government subject to Big Coal/Big Oil, like that wasn't the case the last five times.
2765 2018-01-24 18:37:00 CBD oil for dogs. This is one of the most heavily used products I have seen. Research is a must to find the best, and using the correct dosage, but it has a wide range of benefits. Includings allergies, anxiety, cancer, joints, etc.

2790 2018-01-24 18:33:48 I ended up crying after having a heated discussion about renewable energy with my boss. I know he made his money in oil so it's hard for him to hear that we need other options.
2791 2018-01-24 18:33:43 So lets ask SIU what the rUK trade INTO Scotland is , and post indy where Scottish TAXATION would go 100%? Or how about WHY isnt OIL and Gas included as Scottish output? Then lastly would rUK then not Trade with Scotland?

2795 2018-01-24 18:33:21 Though, they tried to get psychopathic policies through, eg. for profit health insurance, pension cuts, welfare cards, sweeping homeless under bridges away from city centres, neg gearing, capital gains tax discounts, giving away oil & gas, giving away minerals, pork barrelling.

You sold the people of your state a bill of goods so that you could make more money.
2826 2018-01-24 18:29:56 FSG balanced the books, expanded the stand, and got a top level coach. Not everyone is PSG, Barca, Real, Bayern, Man U, and City flush with oil money or can attract their national talent without a fight. We’re slowly catching back up but it takes time and patience.

2860 2018-01-24 18:25:26 Made me laugh out loud. I'd need to submit a huge appendix to my tax return to match this, but it would include oil companies, billionaires, legislators.

2862 2018-01-24 18:25:04 That's only what they want Democrats to believe! They are here to setup overthrow of US government an Constitution.Fracking is to be used to destroy drinking water to bring US to its knees in weeks! Hence oil will be cheaper than water.Notice oil/gas prices up
2863 2018-01-24 18:24:45 RIP Jack Ketchum. Will never forget the experience of pouring through OFF SEASON while on a mountain vacation and thinking I needed to keep scalding water (or was it oil?)  on hand for every rustle outside my window. A true white knuckle writer.
2864 2018-01-24 18:24:35 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry.

2866 2018-01-24 18:24:08 if you make “homemade baked fries” without oil im sorry but those are just soggy potatoes
2867 2018-01-24 18:23:59 Sorry, no.

Obama's Secretary of State owned that one. 

She set up Benghazi as a ruse because Obama DIDN'T want to go in.... her Qatari sponsors wanted Libya to end the noise about trading oil in dinars.

2869 2018-01-24 18:23:45 I was at West Elm the other day and they were selling plain old coconut oil in a

2872 2018-01-24 18:23:18 I’m deadass so scared, yesterday I met with a friend to talk about essential oils for about an hour or 2 (a business thingy she’s in) and now my instagram won’t stop showing me ads for other essential oil companies ...

2879 2018-01-24 18:22:46 Observers beware: crude oil and condensate production is what counts, those 100 to 120 mmbopd figures include biofuels, NGL, and refinery hydrogenation gains.
2880 2018-01-24 18:22:43 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. I hope this helps. TY - Robyn 3/3

2883 2018-01-24 18:22:14 Balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil is God's gift to salads
2884 2018-01-24 18:22:07 Well that’s an additional 2-3% of demand they won’t be supplying and that additional supply growth will help keep prices in check.  If I was running an oil dependent economy I’d feel at least a bit threatened.

2888 2018-01-24 18:21:10 It was bad. The worse loss was my piano. I’d had it since I was a child. It had a soul. I’ll eventually replace my library. I saved my collection of oil paintings, because they were high on the walls. TG.

2894 2018-01-24 18:20:40 @realDonaldTrump you keep saying MAGA  yet you have imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the  solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. your decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs  this year. HAPPY? Amer's r NOT
2895 2018-01-24 18:20:34 Its becausd Calufornua is a Dem state it is so successful. The only comparable red state is Texas which was built on oil. Redstates just prioritise the wealthy and exploit the rest.
2896 2018-01-24 18:20:28 For fighting most cancers, it’s recommended 1g of cannabis oil a day(ingested) for 60 day’s. Some think that’s going to cost a fortune. Not true. Many providers will give it at cost for the sick. Probably cost around 400-600 a month. Compared to chemo costs, that’s a bargain
2897 2018-01-24 18:20:21 Thats amazing! Our Norwegian Oil and energy minister said today; "To produce enough oil and gas is the most important action for reaching the goal of the Paris agreement". He issued "all time high" licenses to explore and produce oil and gas in the Norwegian sea and Barent sea.
2898 2018-01-24 18:20:10 At the doctor, getting my babies annual checkup. It hates having its oil checked. LOL And having to cough. LOL
2899 2018-01-24 18:20:02 That's pretty hilarious, Dax. I don't think there's a major problem with either energy source. However, it's likely moving us in the wrong direction except perhaps in the economic efficiency direction at the moment. Solar however will do nothing but improve while oil worsens.
2900 2018-01-24 18:19:53 Will this offset the jobs lost as a result of the 30% solar panel tax or is that just to discourage clean energy for you oil industry friends?
2901 2018-01-24 18:19:47 Watched 3 episodes of anime. Read part of my car manual. Ate part of my lunch. Checked my oil....
2902 2018-01-24 18:19:39 So we kill the solar industry and the coal industry remains dead but hey the oil boys are still happily contributing to campaigns so there's that.  Wind turbines, do I hear wind turbines?  Anyone?
2903 2018-01-24 18:19:35 Great thing, my check engine light went off. I figured that was gonna happen tho, since I got my oil changed.
2904 2018-01-24 18:19:31 Israel gave up 91% of the land conquered in the Six-Day War when it returned Sinai to Egypt in exchange for peace (even after discovering $180B in oil there). At the time, Israel offered Gaza and WB for peace as well and got a big NO. Israel has no interest in "Greater Israel."

2942 2018-01-24 18:15:25 The fact that we are sitting around trying to justify how we can get use out of Lucic because there is simply no way to love him is exactly why the contract is so bad. It’s also why we may end up losing RNH this off season when the Oil need to shed some cap
2943 2018-01-24 18:15:23 Trump has proven repeatedly that his loyalties lie with the money barons. This will never change. People like Trump and the oil boys are terrified of clean energy because they don't control it and aren't invested in it. We'll see more of this before his term is up.

2948 2018-01-24 18:15:09 I have been trying to find a pattern but I don’t know, I was thinking maybe an intolerance for vegetable oil or something but I don’t know!  It’s been months, I throw up for like 4 hrs and then I feel perfectly fine and then it happens again the next day.
2949 2018-01-24 18:15:06 Salmon contains both cholesterol and saturated fat which raise serum cholesterol levels; also has high levels of mercury; olive oil is not as bad but it also contains saturated fat & v little nutrition; oil isn't so much healthy as it is a less harmful alternative to animal fat
2950 2018-01-24 18:14:33 Thanks for killing alternative energy in the USA with your 30% tax on solar panels. Now you can focus on your donor base, big oil and coal. And put America Last in the lead for recyclable energy. URAI!

3003 2018-01-24 18:08:05 Make sure you're using warm water with bar or liquid form. A quick fix I would do so s larger the bar black soap in my hand and put some coconut oil in the mix too. Should be less harsh. I hope you're only using your palms with black soap and not a clarosonic or facial brush.
3004 2018-01-24 18:08:01 After washing my CI I always wipe it dry and apply a thin layer of canola oil
3005 2018-01-24 18:07:57 I just started using Alba botanical products (at Target). I love them so far. Their Hawaiian oil free moisturizer is light and smells good. :)
3006 2018-01-24 18:07:56 i wish i could sit in my car while they change my oil these couched are way too small and cube like
3007 2018-01-24 18:07:39 After just over 1 year of relatively slow 'rapproachment' between #Libyan political factions, faciliated by #LNA takeover of the oil crescent in Sep 2016 as well as the rapid ramp up of oil production, the schims look like they may be ripped wide open again in 2018.
3008 2018-01-24 18:07:38 Premier has four production wells online, two at the Catcher field and another two over at the Varadero field, with initial rates from all four producers totalling more than 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day now
3009 2018-01-24 18:07:38 So I tried a facial scrub for the first time, simply mixed sugar and coconut oil and lathered it into my skin. And My SKIN FEELS AMAZING. I can't stop touching.

3013 2018-01-24 18:07:18 Welcome! Make sure to be in Oslo 17.may! Norway and Canada is a bit similar; climate, nature, first nation community etc. We have the cleanest air on the planet, still one of the largest oil and gas producers.

3023 2018-01-24 18:06:27 You can grate it up or break it into pieces, boil distilled water, mix them together, add melted coconut oil or any essential oil of your liking, and let it sit for 2-3 days. It'll be liquid form less harsh.
3024 2018-01-24 18:06:26 I've since learned the installation industry is far larger than manufacturing, so I see the tariff is counterproductive. A better solution would be to provide our solar panel manufacturers their own subsidies, preferably balanced by corresponding reductions in those to Big Oil.

3039 2018-01-24 18:04:38 Watching Dope on Netflix, you have to wonder if the reason why America doesn't legalise drugs and allow other to do so it is that Mexico would become hugely wealthy. Like Scotland would have had Westminster not taken all the oil money.

3133 2018-01-24 17:55:40 And of course, the science of extracting oil from the olives, rapeseed, or sunflower seed is another fascinating process. At least 4 different machines are used to make cold pressed virgin olive oil, it's amazing!
3134 2018-01-24 17:55:33 Keep the oil running!!
3135 2018-01-24 17:55:26 me: *shows kirsty my oil pastel piece*
kirsty: eew thats an UGLY photo!!! you take UGLY photos
me: its not a photo ive drawn that
kirsty: OH ......... thats really good !!
3136 2018-01-24 17:55:22 now we're cookin with oil
3137 2018-01-24 17:55:15 Keep her hair moisturized.. coconut oil and my baby sleeps on a satin bed sheet. Cotton dries it out
3138 2018-01-24 17:55:12 Enter Snake Oil Saleman...
3139 2018-01-24 17:55:03 They tell me something is wrong with my car every time I take mine in for an oil change. Like let me just get it changed so I can leave
3140 2018-01-24 17:55:03 Mobil oil
3141 2018-01-24 17:54:59 People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen. Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
3142 2018-01-24 17:54:38 Castor oil is bae.
3143 2018-01-24 17:54:35 I use jojoba oil on my cuticles and I think it’s helping my nails grow faster as well as moisturizing my cuticles
3144 2018-01-24 17:54:29 While I agree with your statement to a point. I feel like this was targeting clean energy by an administration that doesn't believe in climate change and wants to cater to the oil and coal industries.
3145 2018-01-24 17:54:16 Use a thicker oil to help seal in moisture
3146 2018-01-24 17:54:11 The rats have eaten my corn oil ! I only bought it yesterday.. bastard things 
3147 2018-01-24 17:54:00 @realDonaldTrump No doubt Part of #DonTheCons portfolio includes oil companies.

3148 2018-01-24 17:53:49 Organic coconut oil would be so lovely right now 
3149 2018-01-24 17:53:47 Just deep fried my credit card in peanut oil instead of canola oil, hoping it might slim-down the monthly payment.
3150 2018-01-24 17:53:40 Get that oil out
3151 2018-01-24 17:53:39 All thier pockets are lined with coal and oil money. They see no reason to have solar power.
3152 2018-01-24 17:53:32 North Sea oil works above $100 a barrel - i own an oil company - Oil price always goes up in winter - will be under $50 in June again - Venezuela has biggest oil fields in world but its bankrupt - Scotland could start fracking again (1860-1962) which is what made Scots wealthy
3153 2018-01-24 17:53:30 I’m getting my oil changed & reading a book, & a man next to me says “Puro estudiando” & since I’m in denial about that fact that I’m not a student anymore, I said “Yes sir. Comunicaciones. Me verás en ESPN” and I don’t even know if I said it right but I’m an undergrad again! 
3154 2018-01-24 17:53:27 I can’t wait until this obnoxious essential oil fad is over because honestly they don’t smell good at all.
3155 2018-01-24 17:53:25 ALL YOU NEED IS CASTOR OIL 
3156 2018-01-24 17:53:21 a floor only whilst current oil production holds
3157 2018-01-24 17:53:20 You evidently have not seen me give Ethan shit for hosting Peterson and getting ready to line up that fucking snake oil salesman again but I have done that. I just don't think a blatantly obvious scam is as dangerous as more insidious political figures.
3158 2018-01-24 17:53:14 na buhari 4 go...............make e  go stabilize world oil prices
3159 2018-01-24 17:53:07 Please provide stats proving solar employs more ppl than coal and oil combined
3160 2018-01-24 17:53:04 I don’t see this as targeting solar in order to boost big oil. Solar was on a list of tariffs. Until I have more information, it seems like a push to buy American, and push companies to build manufacturing plants here, rather than import everything.
3161 2018-01-24 17:53:03 If $PBR can move that much then all oil companies like $ESV $NBR $XOM $SN $GPOR $QEP $NE have that potential.. wait and watch how this game will unfold
3162 2018-01-24 17:52:58 Big oil should shut their tap off
3163 2018-01-24 17:52:54 Turn your key to on but don't start the engine and push the gas pedal all the way down a few times. Should turn the oil light off
3164 2018-01-24 17:52:52 Thread : Coconut oil is Life

3165 2018-01-24 17:52:50 Oil price production cuts in 1970's and price force rise by GS did eventually cause massive problems in economies, asset/price inflation and finally unemployment rose, regressions caused social-, political-, economical problems in;
USA, Iran, Russia, Europe, Middle East, now too?
3166 2018-01-24 17:52:48 But as he "helps" US  solar panel factories, he hurts people who work in installation, which is 23,000 jobs, by raising the cost of solar so fewer want it installed.  He is simply  protecting oil profits for friends and donors.
3167 2018-01-24 17:52:47 Hala pues vamos a ello:

3169 2018-01-24 17:52:37 Cos it wasn’t good in the 90s. If it means spurs get an oil tycoon or sheikh to spend and become competitive then I’m all for that!
3170 2018-01-24 17:52:24 PSA: Don't bother putting oil on sweet potato fries/wedges!!! Seasoning will stick fine without it and they are so much more delicious & healthy!

Machine learning has interesting potential, though there's much snake oil out there right now as I understand #includecybersecuritychat
3178 2018-01-24 17:51:33 Like the street picture. It would make for a nice oil painting.
3179 2018-01-24 17:51:30 Just think of the economic benefit if we could get our oil to tidal waters and lose the huge discount and reduced export we are forced to accept because of pipeline opposition
3180 2018-01-24 17:51:29 I don't trust Sessions because of his financial ties to the prison industrial complex.  That's never going to change especially given the way he has conducted himself in the public arena.  Tillerson is another conflict of interest with his ties to big oil.
3181 2018-01-24 17:51:17 I think EM and PM both mkts should be good. Great for india as oil rising prices will also be offset by lowering of USD to some extent.

Good Question
3186 2018-01-24 17:50:25 #oott  not sure it is great for oil market if just "nice" comments coming from al-falih .. a lot of good news priced in and needs reinforcement of continued cuts

3194 2018-01-24 17:49:46 Wait. How does solar employ more people than oil or coal, yet there’s only one unknown company. I admit I’m uninformed on most of this, as I’ve stated, solar is like a smart wifi light bulb; I know they exist, but don’t have any real world reference to them.
3195 2018-01-24 17:49:43 We use salt and distilled vinegar with a essential oil for all our clothes washes

3242 2018-01-24 17:45:20 I'd wager it's also lobbying from coal/oil who know the threat solar is to them. It's already cheaper than coal, if it gets cheaper than national gas.. They see this as a chance to shut the industry down.

3249 2018-01-24 17:44:29 I believe we need to break our dependency on oil and think solar is a great alternative. This seems like a measure to push buying from American manufacturers. They’d have to pay to use the patens anyway. There’s also a tariff on washing machines, no posts about that.
3250 2018-01-24 17:44:25 I have a water/gel moisturizer atm bc my skin gets dehydrated sometimes it's good but it's more for hydration than actually mousturising which is why I got the jojoba oil to actually moisturize my skin and balance the oils!

3275 2018-01-24 17:41:48 Hace unos pocos años cuando México y Venezuela aún eran países petroleros EU casi no producía petroleo e importaba casi todo de Medio Oriente.

US oil production: 9.878MMbpd
Saudi Arabia oil production: 9.918MMbpd
México y Venezuela IMPORTAN más del 80% de la gasolina.

3354 2018-01-24 17:35:07 And to get the oil wells?
3355 2018-01-24 17:35:03 It's true that oil has been the source of their wealth.  But they used it to diversify their economy & provide public goods, including a sovereign wealth fund.  Our source of wealth is already diversified.  And rather than digging up oil, we should dig up public goods.
3356 2018-01-24 17:34:53 I've thought about this problem. in my show, the restaurant only serves oil for robots, meaning they're now married to the drama

3358 2018-01-24 17:34:31 And it will. My point was is that a stable gas price of 3 could be good for us, if we are getting our oil from us production. Personally it would hurt my wallet as well as yours. But I agree. And I do believe that prices will rise higher still yet.

3405 2018-01-24 17:29:15 Nicolas Maduro says each petro will be worth the equivalent of one barrel of oil, and he has specifically designated the oil from field one of the Ayacucho block in the Orinoco region of Venezuela, which contains more than 5 billion barrels.
3406 2018-01-24 17:29:13 According to this thread, it saved him from "near certain death."  I can't imagine what near death incident oregano oil can save someone from.
3407 2018-01-24 17:29:12 Have fun in Mexico! I’ll touch base later in February when the boys are playing at home. Honestly, as big a fan I am of the Oilers, I have to say the effort & heart that our Oil Kings display every game they play, will get me there every day of the week & twice on Sundays!

3410 2018-01-24 17:28:45 Perhaps we should do more oil drilling like they do. It’s why they’re so wealthy.
3411 2018-01-24 17:28:45 They stole us black and blue, the tenure of GEJ crude oil was within $110 on a the average and we sold 2.1m barrel each day no pipeline bombing yet no meaningful development can be pointed to except massive looting of the treasury
3412 2018-01-24 17:28:42 That Russia narrative is leaking oil badly and they know it!
3413 2018-01-24 17:28:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3414 2018-01-24 17:28:31  you make me soooo sick. but ok. I just gotta get my oil changed first.
3415 2018-01-24 17:28:12 But increase in use of palm oil etc in products replacing meat means destruction of wild habitats and rural populations worldwide. Not that easy.
3416 2018-01-24 17:28:00 Giving my baby Mali some TLC . Think I’ll get her an oil change n some more lights after my appointment .
3417 2018-01-24 17:27:59 The same reason drilling for oil is banned on the west coast
3418 2018-01-24 17:27:58 I feel the government is cheating the public on the fuel prices. When the crude oil prices were low, you increased the excise duty. If it continues, it may be the reason for political change. @PMOIndia @dpradhanbjp @arunjaitley
3419 2018-01-24 17:27:54 Agreed!
I don’t want Canada to be like THAT country.
Big problem; oil dependancy money.
We need to get rid of that all the while replacing the revenue that would’ve been made from oil, replacing the energy source, replacing the jobs that will be lost, & clean up messes left.
3420 2018-01-24 17:27:50 Fresh oil change so you know the engine roaring 
3421 2018-01-24 17:27:45 Ireland pension is double that in Northern Ireland Double. Scotland can easily do an oil top up so that people get the base and a bit more on top.

3439 2018-01-24 17:25:13 Small #'s. About 400 vs 300. Norway used to be a 's***hole' country in the 1800's. Thousands came to the US. That was until the passage of the 1924 Immigration Act, the law designed to keep out Southern and Eastern Europeans, and Asians. Plus Norway got into oil and prospered.
3440 2018-01-24 17:25:12 Unfortunately 'devaluation' and high oil production/price is being hailed as that magic wand by many..

3442 2018-01-24 17:25:02 £381b more to Norway than UK let alone Scots claim they got for oil.  And they have far less! I know Scotland & NHS across UK did not get it but it went somewhere. I can only imagine BVI Caymans, Jersey or similar. That's the real issue. Just look at Ireland & N.I GDP being half!

3461 2018-01-24 17:22:34 I'll try to sum up a bit the rather complicated sanctions mechanism: 
1. CAATSA makes mandatory (they were arbitrary) existing secondary sanctions under UFSA>target any foreign person that makes significant investm in a special Russian crude oil project on or after Sept 1, 2017+
3462 2018-01-24 17:22:18 Not great for that $2t valuation. Cushions investors a bit from low oil prices but reduces their ability to benefit from high ones. While govt exposure stays basically the same.
3463 2018-01-24 17:22:18 Oil changes don’t cost that much so you can’t really make any money. Especially after buying the oil and filter and what not

3467 2018-01-24 17:21:40 The administration doesn't control us oil output or the decisions made by OPEC/Russia. The second of which have been working on and sticking to a lower supply of oil. Obviously increasing cost. While US production has increased, yes, it's been slight. The primary factor is OPEC
3468 2018-01-24 17:21:28 Good question. In Texas, PR guidance is presumptively “or,” & excludes oil, a horse, a dairy cow, 120 chickens, a Holy Book, & nuclear weapons.
So one could steal a client’s dairy cow, defraud a chicken, mistakenly cause a nuclear detonation & hump a bible & be within the rules.

3476 2018-01-24 17:20:28 1) I used canned lentils because I was lazy. Not all spices used are mentioned here because I use many.
Two cans of lentils, drained. 
Heat oil and throw cumin, fenugreek, mustard seeds and wait for them to start popping. Add chopped onions and cook for 1 minute.

3508 2018-01-24 17:17:19 Okay, I give in. If we're going to have open borders, then let's let Texas and N. Mex and Arizona expand their states a few thousand miles into Mexico. I bet we could do some good ranching, oil drilling and farming down there. Maybe even employ some of the natives.
3509 2018-01-24 17:16:54 And like a sinking oil tanker, he will be expected to go down with a generation of blame and accountability that would have brought down so many more people. Many guilty will breathe a sigh of relief at their narrow escape. Till the next culprit.

3538 2018-01-24 17:13:57 You don’t employ more people than oil and gas. Nice try though. And coal was pushed out by Obama, so that’s a dishonest example.
3539 2018-01-24 17:13:50 Thank you... I was panicking earlier but this provides some clarity

3548 2018-01-24 17:12:54 Part of it is locally sourced, part of it is because oil tanked & property owners are expected to make up the difference for Ed. Other increases come from NWE passing costs on to customers. Small amounts, but it's adding up to increases of hundreds of dollars per year. #mtpol

3552 2018-01-24 17:12:26 What? I wasn't commenting on independence. Just how gas/oil price can have a positive effect in certain areas of country.
3553 2018-01-24 17:12:22 Less than u may expect: one third of the country starved to death in the Bolshevik collectivization, and they were sparsely populated to begin with.. Anyhow, Chinese comrades will take care of the oil, we dont have to concern ourselves

3556 2018-01-24 17:12:14 Who is we? Do you own an oil company because I don't. It's a freely traded commodity.  Private enterprise are the ones with the moral failing.  Stop trying to shame Canadians for what corporations are responsible for..

3561 2018-01-24 17:11:41 I know this sounds like a snake oil remedy, but you should try lavender oil.  I get insomnia bad, especially when it's hot out.  Put a little bit of it on the bottom of your big toe so the smell isn't too overpowering, and it apparently relaxes you.

3566 2018-01-24 17:11:00 There is a big protest right now in Halifax because it appears your government is opening the door to new offshore oil and gas.  The hypocrisy is becoming too much to stomach.  Emissions are rising, fossils are heavily subsidized & polluters get any pipeline or project they want.
3567 2018-01-24 17:10:53 Quit trying to act like this is all about border security and the military. It’s all about you fulfilling a snake oil salesman’s campaign promise and using the lives and futures of the dreamers as a bargaining tool! Despicably evil human being you are!

3599 2018-01-24 17:07:14 Ya that’s why it’s so important but people get lost in the weeds analyzing global oil supply/demand picture because of myopic focus on shale. Part of the Reason why #IEA is wrong on their forecasts every year.

3647 2018-01-24 17:02:48 Thesis - Roger's Place is so quiet, like a tomb, when it isn't playoffs.  Oil start with no energy.  No energy means fall behind or take lazy penalties.

3649 2018-01-24 17:02:30 Depends on where we are getting out oil from. $3 gas prices will surge parts of the country that have taken a major hit when they fell. Which they fell because of OPEC, literally nothing to do with Obama.. Lol. Regardless there will be some give and take.

3679 2018-01-24 17:00:23 This is some public health boards and publishers should actually check more than just asking people if they have conflicts of interest. Universities also need to care and for that to happen, we need things like BP oil money to stop investing so much into them.

3681 2018-01-24 17:00:12 Good grief, Chris! The order will cost more jobs than it will create. Trump does not want Americans to use clean energy. @RevLaurieinLex is correct.

3683 2018-01-24 17:00:06 I’m thinking that if you go back to first time oils hit 120-150 per barrel it was almost a cent on gas ever time oil went up a dollar. Oil went back down. Gas did not do the same Someone’s making money. #gasprices

3798 2018-01-24 16:48:11 I have succumb to the crap my kids were sick with. Today is gonna be all about orange juice, sheet masks, my SanDaWha Camellia Whitening Oil Mist, and keeping a generous coating of Vaseline around my nose to prevent chapping  I may dehydrate but by God my skin ain't gonna.
3799 2018-01-24 16:48:11 girls don't never change their car oil
3800 2018-01-24 16:48:07 So De Bruyne's given his new contract earning 18 mill p/a.. paid for by oil money.. nobody bats an eyelid. United who generate their own wealth to pay for Sanchez’s LOWER wages.. all hell breaks lose.. #Hypocrisy #HatedAdoredNeverIgnored #United #mufc
3801 2018-01-24 16:48:06 This is a decoy to make us think the solar panel tarriff is not just about Big Oil. We're not that stupid.
3802 2018-01-24 16:48:05 Wilbur Ross owns big numbers of oil stocks.
3803 2018-01-24 16:48:05 omg! Everything. I always love the part where you first drop it in the bath and it was even more fun this time. And it looked beautiful and the oil was extra soothing. I didn't even want to get out. My skin feels so great. Also my whole apartment smelled amazing.
3804 2018-01-24 16:47:49 Oil was that thinking more of a move up but in terms of action to the up side compare to the move down in the dollar makes this a questionable thing.  Look for weakness
3805 2018-01-24 16:47:48 He doesn't understand tariffs anymore than any other aspect of government or trade. This tariff hike was an accomodation for this gas and oil industry donors. #CorruptPOTUS #NoJobsPresident
3806 2018-01-24 16:47:35 Spent 45 dollars on a gram of cbd oil and it taste like shit and doesn't relieve any of my pain  I'm pissed.
3807 2018-01-24 16:47:29 I might actually have to learn about perfumerie for that — researching carrier oils and scent throws and whatnot. Technically the cuticle oil is safe for use on skin but I don’t think the fragrance lasts as long as a true perfume would.
3808 2018-01-24 16:47:29 Megyn Kelly's show is on in the lobby while I'm getting an oil change. People enjoy this shit? Really?
3809 2018-01-24 16:47:23 Olive oil is the answer to all your problems
3810 2018-01-24 16:47:22 Argan Oil is packed full of repairing and nurturing antioxidants for glowing skin! It’s in our #FrankincenseIntense Eye Cream!
3811 2018-01-24 16:47:20 Why this white fish trying to explain palmers coconut oil all detailed. We've been using Palmer's since birth. #WendyWilliams
3812 2018-01-24 16:47:20 You are very naive if you think China doesn't condone this activity.  Just another way for #China to pretend it is complying with the oil ban.
3813 2018-01-24 16:47:18 Warranty don’t cover my oil changes lol
3814 2018-01-24 16:47:08 No, everything gets infused in the hot/warm oil together. Steeped like a tea.
3815 2018-01-24 16:46:58 Oil will go to $70 p/b
3816 2018-01-24 16:46:28 Trump wants to help coal and oil companies. Hazard for our future.
3817 2018-01-24 16:46:19 ISIS was created by US. Saudi and Israel. However there are sincere fighters among them who want to pay US back for murdering so many innocents for oil.
3818 2018-01-24 16:46:09 i have really dry skin too so i use something like cleansing foam every day and after that any kind of hydration cream and mix it with tea tree oil? idk it works for me but i don't if it will help you.. facical toner can help too.
3819 2018-01-24 16:46:07 How do I sign up to get paid to wipe oil on fat asses before camera and video appearances?
3820 2018-01-24 16:46:01 I find anything citrus helps clarity in the mind. Whilst not an essential oil, I love green tea oil if meditating...very refreshing. Neroli or geranium are both uplifting.
3821 2018-01-24 16:45:58 I’m proud to be in BPCL because BPCL believes in people above oil. #BPCLFoundationDay
3822 2018-01-24 16:45:57 @Kohls ugh I'm nervous about a @WinixAmerica filter cartridge for an air purifier I recently ordered. It smells like industrial oil. HEPA filters aren't supposed to smell like that.
3823 2018-01-24 16:45:42 You are correct and had they not tried to sell they oil in Non US dollars they might have been fine. The US is not trying to bring democracy there they are telling you if you dump our dollar we will attack you. The US UK and Israel want to run the world.
3824 2018-01-24 16:45:36 Great choice  The Olive oil extract helps to take the edge off any post-workout discomforts!
3825 2018-01-24 16:45:29 And a weed store is literally a dream here. We have one of the largest big pharmacy corps headquarters. They make damn sure they pay our politicians enough to keep it illegal. Even CBD oil is illegal now.
3826 2018-01-24 16:44:57 If we are actually going to have this tarrif, and start producing more here, I think the gov't needs to stop subsidizing oil companies and start subsidizing renewables.
3827 2018-01-24 16:44:54 กูก็คนนะเว้ยมีความรู้สึกเหมือนกัน จะเล่นไรคิดถึงความรู้สึกกูบ้างได้มั้ยว่ะ
3828 2018-01-24 16:44:51 heating up dis coconut oil with weed extract in it YALL KNOW WTF IS GOJNG ON 
3829 2018-01-24 16:44:50 #oott well that was big swing reverse in #oil .. I still just think it cools off #CL_F
3830 2018-01-24 16:44:48 Sorry but #Oil $CL_F should be much higher than 64.60 +.13 +.20%... #EIA REPORTS A 10TH STRAIGHT DAILY DECLINE IN U.S. #Crude SUPPLIES"... these drawdowns are real & the supply side like #OPEC working to keep that down. $CAN $MXN trade & border stuff matter. Global tensions etc.
3831 2018-01-24 16:44:39 Falafel is basically meat though :D Just make sure you use enough oil to fry it. Cook until it's brown and crispy and watch it so it doesn't burn. Also watch it when you flip them, be careful or it will fall apart!
3832 2018-01-24 16:44:35 So I took my car in for an oil change and checkup when I noticed my car was leaking oil. The mechanics told me that my housing unit was cracked on the bottom and I would need to replace it asap. Nic and I both checked and the leak was coming from the top so we told them we would-
3833 2018-01-24 16:44:32 So tell me what you know. I have 22 years in technology. Radio, Internet Protocol, FCC regulation. I have built Educational, Municipal, Oil & Gas, Rual WISPs, Smart Grids... been a consultant for some of the largest tech companies in the world. Have a  and run along 
3834 2018-01-24 16:44:26 If I may, since we did bring up the race card, do we know any white people that use the hair products stolen? Now I’m not saying race never plays a factor but ain’t no white people stealing Cantu oil. Come on now. We have to pick our battles.
3835 2018-01-24 16:44:14 I wonder if this would still have been the case had our government put all their eggs in the basket that is the price of oil?
3836 2018-01-24 16:44:13 Right! So you can try to pay more attention out in the world. From the (seemingly) small things - you and your partner take the car for an oil change or go to a restaurant, and the technician/waitstaff looks to you first to answer. Seems small and silly - but, that's a bad model.
3837 2018-01-24 16:44:11 Spoil me with loyalty, oil me in royalty.. you don’t know yourself you so asleep
3838 2018-01-24 16:44:11 U.S. oil embargo of Imperial Japan was not a war crime. Japan’s Nanking massacre was.

3845 2018-01-24 16:43:36 Quote:As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
3846 2018-01-24 16:43:35 Browns Gas, water and baking soda. You can use table salt as well. There is huge supply covering the earth, The Oceans. But it didn't require anything from RR Rockefeller or Old Oil money so it got forgot, when anyone would remember they got dead or gone. They lied about it all.

3853 2018-01-24 16:43:13 Hey Marco - what's up with the 30% tariff?  Florida could sure use solar power.
Most U.S. jobs in energy are installing imported solar panels, solar provides more jobs in power sector than any other form:

Solar: 373,807
Wind: 101,738
Coal: 86,035
Gas: 52,125
Oil: 12,840

3870 2018-01-24 16:41:23 I was replacing a gasket to fix an oil leak for my Lt. Worked on between calls & station duties. Didn't finish until 3am. Showered, threw clothes in washer, laid down & saw your post on Charlie.

3875 2018-01-24 16:40:25 Castor oil is a good emollient for my skin since it will stays matte on the surface of your skin, if you hydrate your skin enough before that.
3876 2018-01-24 16:40:23 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.

3878 2018-01-24 16:40:20 Hmm....I think we are in earnings season and nobody can figure out what earnings are going to be with the tax bill changes and one time charges.  Money is on the sidelines waiting for companies to report (especially in Oil and Gas).
3879 2018-01-24 16:40:19 Imagine an America that commits its industrial strength to shift from fossil fuels into renewables in both use and manufacture.  We're expanding the drilling of oil.  Why not invest in future technologies that will eventually prevail anyway??
3880 2018-01-24 16:40:16 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!

3884 2018-01-24 16:40:06 So, here we go, stocks sell, bonds sell, dollar sells, and now oil sells. Something ain't right.
3885 2018-01-24 16:39:57 Non-oil sector (job employing sector) still in recession though. 

Oil sector got out of recession because of rise in oil price. Just saying
3886 2018-01-24 16:39:54 Killing solar so oil is back in play. It’s the only asset Russia has so Trumps helping Putin & the Kremlin out. Note those in Trumps cabinet tied to oil.

3901 2018-01-24 16:38:33 This is just but a dress rehearsal of what's coming during the #StateCaptureInquiry . #propagandamachine will run out of oil @eNCA @Radio702 and them. Having heard chief justice briefing it will be very interesting.
3902 2018-01-24 16:38:33 And that’s why I don’t think petroleum powered vehicles will ever go away. We have great infrastructure in place and plentiful oil. Ironically, more EVs (on a large scale) actually makes oil cheaper by reducing demand. Golden Age of cheap fuel options on the horizon.

3913 2018-01-24 16:37:19 The thing is, Quebec has only been oil crazy for about 15 years.  It's all part of the Harper & Marois political era.  We are about to correct that.  This O&G debate, along with Trumpism, is helping us cement our values. Everyone is dumping oil, fast.  We should see effects soon.

3918 2018-01-24 16:37:02 Ha  I covered oil when it was $10 and when it was $140 but it never got back to $10 for the full cycle
3919 2018-01-24 16:36:59 More under Carter....but yes, Obama didn't invade Syria and he tried to get us out of Iraq.

ISIS, regardless of GOP talking points, was not created by Obama, but rather by years of mistreatment by the West and various Middle East dictatorships hogging much of the oil wealth.
3920 2018-01-24 16:36:46 Pretty sure dallas Eakins used the same strategy and Oil fans called him a retard and ran him out of town..... so there's that.

He also told in an election campaign that.. Naseeb .. wale.. Ko.. hi Sarkar mein hona chahiye..
Now Tell Mr. MODI..

3935 2018-01-24 16:35:34 Well, that’s the last time I go to that Jeep dealership.

Refused to honor their own coupon for the oil change [nothing of specificity on it beyond the discount], and told me if I wanted my service engine light checked I should’ve book an appointment.
3936 2018-01-24 16:35:28 Nothing... they are both owned by big oil... as long as they are getting paid they could care less about SC...
3937 2018-01-24 16:35:26 Moroccan oil, and then when I get out of the shower I use it’s a 10!
3938 2018-01-24 16:35:26 Listening @wmnf and caller asks why doesn't Trump slap a big tariff on foreign oil like has on solar? Good question, & I think we all know the answer. #FossilFuelBuddy
3939 2018-01-24 16:35:23 I’m at jeep this morning getting an oil change & they come out calling “Mrs. Kruse, Mrs. Kruse?” & I’m sitting there thinking srsly what idiot doesn’t know they’re calling their name......... that be me

3945 2018-01-24 16:34:57 Like all the green jobs were are losing because your oil company donor's are pushing tariffs on solar imports...or all the corporations that got FAT tax cuts that are going over seas anyway...so. much. Winning.
3946 2018-01-24 16:34:48 Everyone in Quebec heats with wood, except for hi-rise apartments in cities.

The main use of oil is for chainsaws to cut firewood ;)

3950 2018-01-24 16:34:31 In Tejas wind and solar energy are cheaper than oil and gas energy today.  
No pollution, no resultant climate change, plenty of jobs.
3951 2018-01-24 16:34:31 It's because they are all snake oil salesmen!
3952 2018-01-24 16:34:25 Its not our problem that we won 68 trophies made history built a 75+ capacity stadium n becm rich. No oil money
3953 2018-01-24 16:34:19 But you forget that your actions in solar is going to cost 28,000 their jobs so you can protect big oil
3954 2018-01-24 16:34:10 you are referring to 2 stroke oil - you are right but thats another problem caused by burning oil - not petrol or diesel
3955 2018-01-24 16:34:07 recalls of a word-of-wisdom from a mechanic friend many years ago: "Oil is cheap"
3956 2018-01-24 16:33:59 Any Christian that buys this Mulligan BS is not a true Christian in my opinion. But then again the “right wing” evangelical believers have already been unmasked as snake oil salesmen!!
3957 2018-01-24 16:33:56 Shorted $INTC $FB via options today. Tech looks overweight short term. Money flowing to oil and biotech.
3958 2018-01-24 16:33:46 Only worry is oil prices movement
3959 2018-01-24 16:33:46 However the majority of the state are deniers. The entire state gop is bought and paid for by big oil. The answer to a growing population is refusing to use environmental science. It’s cheap city planning. God is responsible for the weather.
3960 2018-01-24 16:33:43 Because citizens will be more ruthless in ensuring accountability with tax money unlike free oil money
3961 2018-01-24 16:33:40 Yeah, I’m sure he’s burning the midnight oil working on the details.
3962 2018-01-24 16:33:19 Woke up 45min late and started to  get a headache and I put some frankincense oil on my temples and now it’s all I smell.
3963 2018-01-24 16:33:06 BUT IF YOUR OIL LIGHT COMES ON PULL OVER RIGHT AWAY. Every mile you drive with the oil light on is producing direct damage on your engine.

3966 2018-01-24 16:32:44 Right. And Loving Vincent CLEARLY deserves the win, but the Academy won't see that.
And I liked Coco, but Loving Vincent is stop motion with oil paintings, which hasn't been done before. We've had CG animated day of the dead musicians before (Book of Life).
3967 2018-01-24 16:32:40 As for the arguments that we should become a third world country so that Nigerians can suffer less while we suffer more.... I'm not buying it. There is no reason for us to lower our standard of living to accommodate Alberta oil profiteers.

3969 2018-01-24 16:32:16 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry.

3970 2018-01-24 16:32:15 You can never check oil too often, I would say 5k is average. That’s what my Toyota calls for, but my boyfriend has a Hyundai that calls for every 7k

3978 2018-01-24 16:31:03 Not a drop of the oil in Megantic was extracted in Canada. It was Bakken shale from North Dakota, headed for the East Coast.  If Québec had a law prohibiting the transhipment of oil products, it would not have happened.

3999 2018-01-24 16:29:03 If we're talking about a valve cover gasket and it's visibly leaking oil on the engine and covered under warranty I'd do it. If you don't feel comfortable about them then I think other comments about a second opinion are best.

4008 2018-01-24 16:28:10 It really isn't. "Prices are only going to go up 10%" isn't that great of an argument. People WILL lose jobs & fewer solar panels WILL be installed.

Trump didn't impose this tariff to assist solar manufacturers in this country. He did it to help the oil & coal industries.

4027 2018-01-24 16:26:41 where can tell: based in UAE or Qatar, invested in oil, possibly frequented conferences on Twitter?
4028 2018-01-24 16:26:41 I remember the Global Mail in an opinion piece say that Hibernia was a waste of money .. the price of oil would needed to be $12 to break even and $20 to make a good return based on expected oil reserves ...
4029 2018-01-24 16:26:34 Can someone tell me how much of our tax dollars continue to subsidize big oil? And, if you can tell me that, can you also explain how slapping a 30% tariff on Chinese solar panel imports accelerates energy independence? Or, maybe I'm missing something...? Or just need more 
4030 2018-01-24 16:26:19 Do you think he listens to his advisors? He listens to his buddies in oil/goal so they can line their pockets and will endorse him. Solely self interest move. China lays more solar in a month than we do in a year. We are so behind globally.
4031 2018-01-24 16:26:19 Yeah it seems so simple and logical, but then you get into that car dealer minefield. That said, a bad valve gasket can cause performance problems for your car (and poss. messy oil leaks), so if they want to replace it, and at no cost, it should be done.
4032 2018-01-24 16:26:01 Great news...according to WTI, oil prices are near $65/barrel!  If you live in Acadiana, this is very important to us!  It's also a great time to sell and buy a home.  Call me if I can help. #prosperity

4049 2018-01-24 16:23:11 @Varneyco Supposedly, during the last oil production run up, producer's needed a price above $50 to make it economical.

Where are they at since oil is $65 +? Or are the taking advantage of the Saudi slowdown to squeeze more out of less.

4061 2018-01-24 16:22:03 I wish someone would come change my oil so I don’t have to get up
4062 2018-01-24 16:21:47 Me too. But hey! Let’s totally open up our fragile coasts for oil and stuff. What could go wrong?!?

4073 2018-01-24 16:20:37 Iraqi Regional Government only have a role of advisor, when comes Iraqi Oil..
4074 2018-01-24 16:20:24 I couldn't agree more with you @rachelmsavage , just to add that Abia has the capacity to be one of Nigeria's most important industrial hubs, yet our leaders continue to ignore the clear potential and we wonder why we have so many unemployed youth and an oil dependent economy.
4075 2018-01-24 16:20:18 @realdonaldtrump doesn't care about jobs, especially alternative energy jobs. He's a shill for the oil, gas and fracking industries. If anyone ever doubted that, this tariff now should make a believer out of you.
4076 2018-01-24 16:20:11 Interesting as usual. I’ll keep eating Salmon or taking fish oil.
4077 2018-01-24 16:20:02 I use a sugar scrub—sugar w/coconut oil and a bit of lemon essential oil (edible), then apply cocoa butter to my lips. That keeps them from getting chapped. 1/2
4078 2018-01-24 16:20:00 He;s trying to keep oil as an energy source competitive to support the power the US has from the Petrodollar. This is the kind of industry that should be subsidised if anything
4079 2018-01-24 16:19:57 I use natural bread always with lot of kind of seeds... I just toast the bread and add olive oil (some times a little bit of salt... I used to have very low pressure, if you know what I mean) and that's all. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner... Is delicious & healthy! 
4080 2018-01-24 16:19:53 I know I have stated this before David....   WTI #Oil will remain above $60 and hit north of $70 in 2018.   It won't close down today. It will be above $65. IMHO  Hope you are having a good day sir.
4081 2018-01-24 16:19:47 Decisions based on grandiose declarations of USA1st have serious consequences. A simple ask!Let's govern by starting with the facts!RT @NOW1SOLAR: Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.

4095 2018-01-24 16:18:12 Imo, if they're concerned about US sanctions their concern is not #CAATSA but Directive 4 that expand trade of goods, services, technology in support of explorat/production for deepwater, Arctic offshore to projects having potential to produce oil in any location:) #Eni #Rosneft
4096 2018-01-24 16:18:08 “Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined.” The fact that solar provides a tiny fraction of our electricity, but requires more employees that coal and oil combined UNDERCUTS YOUR ARGUMENT. Solar & wind aren’t even feasible w/ the subsidies!

4108 2018-01-24 16:17:12 I always thought that Captain Planet's enemies were ridiculous. Who would want to actively harm the planet we need to live on? Silly me, the answer is Republicans. I cannot fathom why Big Oil does not invest in the next energy source, rather than dwindle & fail like Coal.
4109 2018-01-24 16:17:11 My condolences on the Mégantic disaster!. Lets hope that the government build more pipelines and do not use trucks to deliver all its imported oil and gas in the future. Sadly, the disaster of Megantic proof my point - it is important to produce oil and gas locally...
4110 2018-01-24 16:17:10 Yes.  The tariff decision is a dumb one.  But...please don't ruin your argument with incorrect facts.  The solar industry employs lots of people but does not employ more people than oil and coal combined.  The oil industry employs in the vicinity of 10 million people!
4111 2018-01-24 16:17:09 Well it looks like the next time you change the bulb you may just flush the trans, change the oil, tune up or just trade the car in lol
4112 2018-01-24 16:16:44 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
4113 2018-01-24 16:16:42 Hmmmm. Toys R Us closing 182 stores, Kimberly-Clarke (Kleenex, Huggies) laying off 5000 and #45 has imposed a 30% tax on solar panels.  Solar employs more people than coal and oil. Possible job lost at 23,000.  #MAGA huh? Rrrrrright!
4114 2018-01-24 16:16:40 The article 109 didn't mention the management of Iraqi Oil by regional Government 6 months ago..
4115 2018-01-24 16:16:34 Tariffs were suppose to create a level playing field for U.S. industry. This does the opposite. Raising prices for solar panels will discourage consumers from contracting to install systems-exactly what the Oil and Gas industry wants from the President. Keep those donors happy.

4120 2018-01-24 16:16:10 Oil money mate...
4121 2018-01-24 16:16:05 Solar panels being taxed at 30% a clear and obvious attempt to stretch out the money made by the dying coal and oil industries , Exxon ceo and other big whigs are sure to be happy about the $$ they’re now making
4122 2018-01-24 16:15:43 I’m reminded of a Conrad pol cartoon from the 70s: fat cat saying he controls the coal mines, another boasting he owns the oil, then another saying solar power isn’t feasible.
4123 2018-01-24 16:15:35 Getting an oil change, watching a kid playing a cell phone VR headset game. First time I've seen one of these in out the wild
4124 2018-01-24 16:15:30 Good. Nothing more regressive than a gas tax. Except maybe sales tax on food. For once I agree with an oil baron
4125 2018-01-24 16:15:25 I always have both creamy and crunchy peanut butter, and once while camping I wanted to make some pancakes and had no oil for the pan, so I melted creamy peanut butter in it, worked great

4129 2018-01-24 16:15:07 Palmoil as E471 is always the choice as it’s the cheapest for a stabiliser. If nothing to hide why don’t they just name the oil? In any case Friends with allergies have e-mailed Sunpat who confirm they do in fact use Palmoil. But hey ho I’m sure they will respond to your tweet.

4131 2018-01-24 16:15:04 Intraday action doesn't matter as much as where it closes. If #Oil closes down today, that's a massive bearish signal of a top imho. Early days yet.

4151 2018-01-24 16:13:25 We have had an opportunity to create millions of jobs in the clean energy sector that Obama promoted.  But since oil companies own dirty politicians on the right they are killing job growth.  These tax cuts will do nothing more than make the rich richer.

4165 2018-01-24 16:12:22 Guess its more a one-man WISH rather then an real agreement. The regime is in very good position on #Afrin. They can demand a full takeover as Astana/Soci talks garantee some kind of “peace routemap for united Syria”.
And #Afrin wo oil rich east Syria is useless for regime.
4166 2018-01-24 16:12:16 ........Thank you for this thread.....Exxon? Do you slow production of renewables, increasing the need for fossil fuel? Do you halt sanctions against Russia thereby opening the huge oil fields in Russian Arctic for Exxon exploration? Just thinkin'....

4169 2018-01-24 16:12:09 The object of Trump’s solar tariff wasn’t to create jobs.  It was to keep solar energy from dethroning the wicked King Coal and Queen Oil just a little bit longer.
4170 2018-01-24 16:11:52 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Oil is going up again now over $65.00 a barrel. And your not doing anything about it. This is really hurting the middle class. It doesn’t matter how much $ you save us on taxes if we have to pay $2,000.00/yr more on gasoline. #WTP

4187 2018-01-24 16:09:33 So I got some jojoba oil - my skin has been really nice recently besides my acne, I got it bc my skin is oily so I figure this will help balance it out a bit bc my moisturizer doesn't do much for me on its own but is there any other uses for it?
4188 2018-01-24 16:09:23 Then stop all efforts to categorize CBD oil as schedule 1, legalize marijuana and see what happens.  Or will that make who really owns you upset?
4189 2018-01-24 16:09:17 I'm willing to bet he could care less... Big Oil controls him. He has devastated the EPA. This comes as no surprise. I'm from New York City... everyone here knows he's a con man a liar and a thief.
But he managed to fool the rest of the country.
4190 2018-01-24 16:08:58 Some of those regulations like drilling for oil off of our shores is keeps us safe and I know you get it and don’t care about anyone else when the only state that is exempt from drilling happens to be Florida where mar a lago sits on the ocean. Your are a idiot.

4337 2018-01-24 15:55:17 Lower 48 oil production was up 125k week over week. Hard to read too much into it because of January weather related softness but if this trend is sustained it means US shale is back with a vengeance. Thousands of DUCs have been laying dormant like a virus. #OOTT

Steam and the oil you're telling me telling me
4339 2018-01-24 15:55:06 RT @NOW1SOLAR: As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
4340 2018-01-24 15:55:01 $COP New 52wk high today! Oil is making a come back.
4341 2018-01-24 15:54:53 Everyone who shops at l/ush: Why won't the employees leave me alone 
Me while working at l/ush: watches a grown adult try to eat from the fresh face mask bar and another rub a bath oil on their face
4342 2018-01-24 15:54:49 Yeah, how about tear apart your knee, fracture your femur, smash your spinal cord, get transported by ambulance after a car accident where the jaws of life have to be used, or have your chest cracked after heart surgery, and we'll give you some hemp oil. SMH
4343 2018-01-24 15:54:28 Business 101: Oil priced in dollars. The dollar slides 10% down. Barrel of oil cost rises to $65+. Your price for gas at the pump rises to match. Strengthen the dollar by reducing our nation’s debt to make your price at the pump go down. Any questions?
4344 2018-01-24 15:54:24 Petrol price at Mumbai at Rs 80.30 per litre. Way the Crude Oil is going up the petrol will soon reach Rs 90 per litre. Middle is being crushed.
4345 2018-01-24 15:54:14 My dumbass bought a car that takes expensive synthetic oil, instead of conventional oil. So now my oil changes are gonna be like $55. I probably should have had someone help me buy a car because I literally know nothing.
4346 2018-01-24 15:54:13 The second most "sustainable" "Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels" company on that list is Enbridge, a key player in Alberta's tar sands and in expanding North America's fracking infrastructure. Proud company for Neste??
4347 2018-01-24 15:54:08 I would push even harder for the bullet train, but again the Auto parts, Airlines, and Oil taicoons lobbying agents might not want to let Houston jump to future once in for all.
4348 2018-01-24 15:54:04 Really tho I feel this. My brother works in the oil field and hearing about this breaks my heart and scares me. I can’t even imagine what their families are going through.
4349 2018-01-24 15:53:56 @stephstreit try lavender in your essential oil diffuser :)
4350 2018-01-24 15:53:53 If oil bear since up too much, too many longs; why equity bull? (Same applies in spades) Narrative trumps Logic ...party on!
4351 2018-01-24 15:53:52 Just does my head in how boys judge girls’ makeup as if they look like an oil painting themselves 
4352 2018-01-24 15:53:49 How can our community for in for our recreation
4353 2018-01-24 15:53:43 What is a war for oil?
4354 2018-01-24 15:53:35 How much of that was from Middle Eastern oil princes building mosques?
4355 2018-01-24 15:53:32 Oil prices bounce back as US crude stockpiles fall by 1.1 million barrels. Traders are taking out a growing number of put options to sell crude, a strategy aimed at protecting against a drop in prices after a sharp rally since December. #FX #trading #fxnews

4357 2018-01-24 15:53:08 If the dollar keeps falling though then this will be wrong since the oil price will keep rising.

4359 2018-01-24 15:52:59 Also had oil spill
4360 2018-01-24 15:52:59 Perry has no more business running the Department of Energy than a red fox posing as a watchdog over a poultry farm. He takes his orders from the oil industry, and the environmental regulations he was to enforce, are gone. Well, send Attaboy back to Texas: mission defunct.
4361 2018-01-24 15:52:47 UPA Govt at $108 global oil gave us petrol at rs65. 
Nation got social welfare & subsidies in other fields too. 

BJP Govt at $60 global oil gives petrol at rs75. 
And the welfare & subsidies in other fields reduced & removed too. 
Elite regime. 

One more negative.
4362 2018-01-24 15:52:44 Of course oil companies are investing.. They have to be or they'll be left behind.. Companies have to always be going for the next big thing.. Wind power solar power charge and go electric fuel station.. You think they made Exxon by just sitting on piles of money?
4363 2018-01-24 15:52:41 @jctheproducer try oil control lotion and a little translucent powder for a super natural, matte finish that doesn’t look like makeup!
4364 2018-01-24 15:52:37 People need to understand. They're not against the pipeline. When they're being honest they will admit - they want to oil to stay in the ground.
4365 2018-01-24 15:52:36 Currently inhaling essential oils because of the oil diffuser necklace my boyfriends mom gave me for Christmas and I’m loving it. 
4366 2018-01-24 15:52:32 Seriously oil ripping second day and oil companies going down again, wtf.
4367 2018-01-24 15:52:32 My brother told me cops don't usually pull you over for a headlight. Well, well, well....I got pulled over for it. The cop says he was checking for drunk drivers. So, getting a new bulb along with my oil change. #OnlyMe

4369 2018-01-24 15:52:22 U plz keep ur bloody gob shut and oil ur own machine ( concrete on England Cricket, recently struggled against pace and bounce )
4370 2018-01-24 15:52:21 Do you know it is required by law that government provides a ‘Petroleum Register’ just so citizens can track the various oil and gas contracts?
4371 2018-01-24 15:52:19 Tromborg Deluxe facial cream is also luscious on the skin. And the facial oil with sunflower from Kiehl’s. Especially love the oil!
4372 2018-01-24 15:52:19 He wants to make sure he has the USA as his biggest buyer for all the oil they are gonna drill out of the Arctic as soon as he can get rid of those pesky sanctions.
4373 2018-01-24 15:52:18 Seriously why are you fluffing Trump? What do you really think he is going to get you in the end? Do you make a million a year and just want to have 4th house? What's the allure of such an obviously incompetent snake oil salesmen?
4374 2018-01-24 15:52:16 WTI bolts past $65 as the US "oil glut" significantly reduces : West Texas Intermediate - $65.10, Brent Crude - $70.05 #wti #brentcrude #oilandgas #ong

4379 2018-01-24 15:51:44 @SecretaryPerry. Instead of spending your time promoting oil, could you come to Hanford Nuclear Reservation again? That first tour was just spit and polish. We've got radioactive shit leaking, vapors detected near state hwy and workers sickened. Hear about it? You are a joke!
4380 2018-01-24 15:51:39 after which the oil price will rise again, and they'll then proceed with the IPO. Complete speculation I admit.

4387 2018-01-24 15:50:59 No!
world is not ready for that yet!
Oil any way is so 20th century!
4388 2018-01-24 15:50:57 My idea is that they will delay the IPO of Aramco further now - since this 100BN gives them leeway and they no longer need to rush to raise capital.  In the interim, they may drive the oil price down again - attempt to bankrupt some of the shale companies.
4389 2018-01-24 15:50:53 Lotion ko na ata yung efficascent oil HAHA
4390 2018-01-24 15:50:51 US oil prices rose above $65 a barrel for the first time since December 2014.

This may affect your flight ticket price. 
4391 2018-01-24 15:50:45 I wonder if there is a co-relation to the massive increase in oil drilling & fracking in Alaska with the earthquake & tsunami alert along the western coast?  But our media won't cover the underlying causes if it impacts big oil?

I'm not kidding
4393 2018-01-24 15:50:35 Trump is working to destroy the possibilities renewable clean energy can provide. His friends sell oil and coal.

4398 2018-01-24 15:50:14 Naaalala ko yung time na tanga ang tingin ko sa Gobyerno dahil di nila ginagamit ang natural resources like oil but when you look at it, the era of oil is slowly slipping away and if we did destroy ecosystems just for profit, useless pala
And now we let China do it for us instead
4399 2018-01-24 15:50:13 When will you ever learn.  Climate change is political move to control people.  CO2 is God's gift to plants and human population.  Oil,gas and  coal gave us the modern society.  #maga #climatechange

4417 2018-01-24 15:48:56 Except he does want the industry to go down. He's made promises to coal and oil industries that he can't deliver without killing their competition. The tarrif does nothing but harm the American solar industry and kills a lot of jobs in the process.

4432 2018-01-24 15:47:47 a big assholleee on his way out,... selling UT out to oil/gas. But then you're an assssholleeee too, undermining Mueller because you're guilty of collusion too. Step aside or you will be forced out.
4433 2018-01-24 15:47:45 @shadmik, while the use of alternative energy sources is growing and our energy mix is more diverse today, the end of oil is nowhere in sight. Technology is changing and automation is always a factor, but the energy industry will continue to need a workforce long into the future.
4434 2018-01-24 15:47:43 Try cannabis oil, it is legal. Also take hemp oil. NEVER GIVE UP.

4436 2018-01-24 15:47:38 Corn needs to be paying attention to ethanol inventory right now. These plants will slow down at these margins. Plant maintenance downtime. DDGs and corn oil are great, but got to make money on your primary product.
4437 2018-01-24 15:47:37 Anything for coal and oil. So he doesn't care. Guess solar industry didn't pay him enough.
4438 2018-01-24 15:47:34 "Men" finding successful women, leeching off them, being companions, "taking care of you"..."when I come home, my bath is run", "he takes my car for an oil change", "he picks me up from the airport", I'm sure he does all those things, he has time, as he doesn't have a job!

There are a few Poland specific ETFs. mostly financials, so domestic / regional growth play, and €++ won't hurt. there's some political risk but I think it's overstated..

4455 2018-01-24 15:46:14 Fundamental problem with the US is our inability to stop with the hyperbole. The rest of the world is not interested in our gift of freedom that comes wrapped in oil, local despots, and weapons.

4473 2018-01-24 15:44:40 This is true, though I doubt enough people will change on their own. We have to bite the bullet and take out the oil, coal and gas industries. The people want this issue solved for them and we have to change their ways for them. This is the only way I see it.

4736 2018-01-24 15:25:05 Next to follow, the Trump energy slump, where no coal or oil jobs come back, but half or more of the solar energy jobs are lost (mostly in sunny red states)! MAGA, so much winning who-hoo!
4737 2018-01-24 15:25:05 23,000 Americans will be losing their jobs in solar panels. $Billions in contracts will be cancelled.  Trump did this for the oil industry.  He owed them.

4739 2018-01-24 15:25:01 my tunisian opium essential oil is a little too popular at the sober house
4740 2018-01-24 15:25:01 And also because 6 years ago they forbade the exports of dielectric oil. But if those restrictions were eliminated my business could survive because we would import the raw materials, then use them to produce, sell and export. The same happens with every business here
4741 2018-01-24 15:24:58 Look at the sources. Iranian government is the one saying everything is fine, unemployment is going down, oil sales are going up, etc. etc.

What needs to be noted is that they're basically in an economic depression due to sanctions, corruption, and economic mismanagement.
4742 2018-01-24 15:24:54 So I was at home getting food ready..then I realised olive oil is finished..so i have to go out again fuckkkk
4743 2018-01-24 15:24:51 Paula’s choice is a great brand!
If you’re someone who wears makeup their cleansing oil is a great makeup remover.
4744 2018-01-24 15:24:50 I agree my point was if there was more oil then maybe the sides would be more even at present it's David Vs golaith
4745 2018-01-24 15:24:33 I get sugaring done once every 5 weeks but in between that time I would just put the tea tree oil on after I bathe
4746 2018-01-24 15:24:30 My hair been less frizzy ever since i started using this hair oil, but now i feel like something is off? Like part of my look was bigger hair than this
4747 2018-01-24 15:24:28 On protected areas, another guy says there's a need for more consultation. Areas not allowed for fishing can still be used for seismic blasting for oil. Doesn't see how anyone can defend that.

4749 2018-01-24 15:24:25 I love a man that smells like Cocoa Butter or Coconut Oil
4750 2018-01-24 15:24:22 Quit trying. "Social license" has proven to be a dud. Extract oil, and spend your money on your employees. Not trying to convince environmentalists how good you are. They will never care, and will work tirelessly to keep Alberta oil in the ground.
4751 2018-01-24 15:24:18 This is yet another stumbling block in the mass adoption of cheaper renewable energy. I'm sure that the oil / extraction sector is gloating.
4752 2018-01-24 15:24:15 Now would be a good time to get prices at the pump reasonable!
$2.20-2.30! 
$2.70-2.79 (NY) to high

4754 2018-01-24 15:23:41 For instance I sell motor and dielectric oil, manufactured by a local family business company. But thanks to the restrictions my business is dying because the company can't produce anything 'cause we don't have any raw materials and the State is the only authorized dealer of it..
4755 2018-01-24 15:23:38 REMITTANCES, not oil are the largest source of income for Mexico
4756 2018-01-24 15:23:18 Someone in bed with big oil is not interested in solar.
4757 2018-01-24 15:23:18 what does oregano leaf oil do?
4758 2018-01-24 15:23:13 gotta do an oil change on my car before school real quick 
4759 2018-01-24 15:22:56 If an eagle is tied to a rope and forced to move around in circles to grind an oil mill, after some time, it might even forget that it can fly, or that flying is its real nature.
4760 2018-01-24 15:22:55 Paying Laporte £470k a week and a 22m signing on fee for a defender is ridiculous! City cashing in on their oil money again
4761 2018-01-24 15:22:49 You must not know then.. first EU regulations is tariff heavy on Africa, France still gets African Oil for nothing, the corruption u talk about us aided by EU and US banks where the loot is hidden so pls who is lying to who?
4762 2018-01-24 15:22:48 We should just build them anyway and equip everyone with them. Let us see how fat oil execs take the loss. I am against anything that hurts a human or animal and destroys our planet.
4763 2018-01-24 15:22:46 can someone give junhui a coconut oil product for his hair thank you
4764 2018-01-24 15:22:38 Snake oil “pastor”.
4765 2018-01-24 15:22:34 Coconut oil is good for you.
4766 2018-01-24 15:22:32 Gotta get to the oil and gas
4767 2018-01-24 15:22:22 Okay lets talk frankly, It is undersand that ISIS is supplied with weapons, not by “black market oil” or “hostage ransoms” but billions of dollars worth of supplies carried into Syria across NATO member Turkey’s borders via hundreds of trucks a day.Who supplies #Turkey? Germany!!

4772 2018-01-24 15:21:55 someone suggested the sugar and tea tree oil. So how often you put the sugar and oil? Everyday ?
4773 2018-01-24 15:21:54 Solar power has been an idea on the cusp since the 70s. It's been that way largely because the oil and coal industries lobbied to kill it in the crib. Obama really gave that industry a boost, but it looks like they're trying to kill it again.
4774 2018-01-24 15:21:47 Trump did it for the US oil industry.  He owes them.

4790 2018-01-24 15:19:54 Why are you destroying the Solar Power industry. Making it easier for you big oil buddies to contribute more to to ill fated reelection
4791 2018-01-24 15:19:44 Cool tariff on solar, which happens to employ more people than coal and oil combined.
4792 2018-01-24 15:19:42 Africa is a confusing continent. Yes you're right it is the most mineral rich continent in the world. It's so rich underground that you never hear of a shortage of oil, diamonds, copper, zinc and a long list of other minerals/resources.

4797 2018-01-24 15:19:13 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
4798 2018-01-24 15:19:09 Every single one of these case studies neglect 2 huge facts.
1: euro socialist nations are perfectly willing to drill/pump/sell every ounce of oil that they can (and use a lot of nuke electricity), where we hamstring ourselves.
2: we cover the defense budget of basically everyone
4799 2018-01-24 15:19:05 Someone I know exfoliates then uses nair and puts tea tree oil after. Me personally I just sugar and use tea tree oil
4800 2018-01-24 15:19:03 Venezuela is the richest country in South America because of their abundance of oil, yet their people are starving cause of socialism #sad
4801 2018-01-24 15:18:42 And yet tariff on solar will lose jobs. Guess your oil and gas friends are happy though.
4802 2018-01-24 15:18:35 Now I’m at Jiffy Lube getting my oil changed. Got several other things to  off the list today but heading over to the Fieldhouse after this for @MemphisWBB/ #1 @UConnWBB

4806 2018-01-24 15:18:04 I agree. Lets ask santa claus what he thinks. Lol. Any Rev that says that is a snake oil salesmen.
4807 2018-01-24 15:17:57 First he cut funding to the NPS, then he reduced he size of monuments and is considering allowing oil and mining companies in protected lands, and now he has put a tariff on sustainable energy. So much for “draining the swamp”, now a dirty swamp could be all our land becomes

4812 2018-01-24 15:17:17 So Trump is costing US jobs... how about tax breaks for domestic producers like the Oil producers get.

4816 2018-01-24 15:17:04 We don't need no stinkin' regulations!  After all, Wall Street and Big Banks are too big to fail.....right?  We the government guarantee that Big Oil and Gas won't pollute the environment..right?
4817 2018-01-24 15:17:04 No, that would be the oil and gas industries, which still enjoy protected status and government subsidies. Once all that pollution hits the air, he may kill the sun. 
4818 2018-01-24 15:17:00 today is National Peanut Butter Day.  Who knew?
I tried the powdered peanut butter the other day. While it's ok, but is missing that creamy peanut oil fat, it is very, very messy. Be sure to eat it in the shower...
4819 2018-01-24 15:16:59 Note to self dirty oil tastes like shit
4820 2018-01-24 15:16:58 Try Jamaican castor oil before bed!
4821 2018-01-24 15:16:57 You should try it, it’s the traditional way of cooking. Cook with oil. Haha. Very savoury. 
I’ve never tried pumpkin soup tho. Is it almost taste the same as pumpkin porridge?
4822 2018-01-24 15:16:55 Ya I'll stick to my coal, gas and oil thanx

4827 2018-01-24 15:16:16 And she plugged my left eyebrow too much in the middle even though I told her I was trying to grow it  I'M just thankful for the fact that my eyebrows grow fast and they're slowly coming back to normal and also for castor oil for making the process even faster.
4828 2018-01-24 15:16:13 And you've proved my point,second followers ah yes that's because like all Scots you have to be loved....it's a typical Scottish trait as you think it means power.
Now go join you fishy leader in stay in the EU and leave the UK lies and don't forget oil tax gets spent in Scotland

4831 2018-01-24 15:16:02 The solar industry employs almost twice as many Americans as coal, oil, and gas combined.  It is clear who favoring fossil fuels over solar helps - and it's not the American worker.
4832 2018-01-24 15:15:47 #Brazil oil giant Petrobras features quite prominently in report by judge in appeal trial of fmr president #Lula. Lula's power to nominate Petrobras directors and grant favours to corrupt contractors seems important to the decision (still to be announced). #TRF4
4833 2018-01-24 15:15:43 When the oil boom happened in the 80’s they predicted Killdeer and Dickinson would expand so much that they would meet - that would have been a massive expansion to fill 36 miles!

4847 2018-01-24 15:14:30 Going to remind you that solar components and wind components are made of petroleum. Without oil production, there would be no alternative energies.
4848 2018-01-24 15:14:18 today, my motor sounds like it had no oil in it again. last night I raced a ej207 swapped second gen leggy and hung doors till 3rd gear. maybe I'll just add more oil lol
4849 2018-01-24 15:13:55 So some corporation can drill for oil, probably.  Imo
4850 2018-01-24 15:13:50 Canada GreenNH3 scientists invented the worlds only (lower cost than oil) zero carbon jet and vehicle fuel. They wish to scale it up but cant seem to find investors ready to stand up to oil. If you know of a way to help them, please do. Honest scientists deserve better treatment
4851 2018-01-24 15:13:41 Pay back to these oil companies
4852 2018-01-24 15:13:34 So you put a 30% tariff on foreign made parts to damage the solar power industry so your friends in big oil can continue to make obscene profits.
4853 2018-01-24 15:13:24 Well his buddy and Secretary of State Tillerson is a former oil exec....this shouldn’t shock anyone. Making his friends richer....that’s why he’s there....not to run your country with the best interest of the people in mind.
4854 2018-01-24 15:13:23 I deep conditioned twice last night: once with a kiddie conditioner and almond oil then overnight with a repairing conditioner and argan oil; then, I rinsed it out and applied a leave in, more almond oil, and more argan oil this morning
4855 2018-01-24 15:13:22 War on clean power .. Focus is on keeping oil rich families Super rich and influential in our politics. We cannot all America to go Backwards this is simple progression,we are evolving as people thru our intuitive nature thru knowledge.Trump go golf and retire.

-Lowest unemployment in 17 years.
-Tax cuts that are proving effective in first month.
-On track to be largest oil producing country in the world this year.
-Revamping Military. 

Con’s ?
4864 2018-01-24 15:12:30 More blood on Trump’s hands as deregulation takes effect in the oil patch. Not good for the workers, but good for Wall Street and the fat cats....
4865 2018-01-24 15:12:29 There’s nothing wrong with incentives and mandates early in an industry. The #oil and #gas industry has received incentives—why shouldn’t we? -@ByronDorgan #NBB18
4866 2018-01-24 15:11:56 Look again usa just reopened alot of the capped wells they figured out how to pull more oil out...alot less oil is being bought from canada now...oil workers are being laid off
4867 2018-01-24 15:11:51 What about all the solar jobs that will be cut because if your tariffs on solar panels?  
Bad move.  Solar is the way to go to save the environment.  
You make some of the stupidest decisions.  
Is it because the oil barons own you, 
along with the Russians?
4868 2018-01-24 15:11:38 The CIA like oil but they don't like people using for there own benefit.Wonder why you didn't mention Argentina's right wing government causing riots with there right wing agenda but that doesn't fit the agenda

4871 2018-01-24 15:11:22 Oil is the most worthless thing as the use of it is being phased out. We sell absolutely loads of things that are more valuable than oil. Scotland on its own has a huge amount of debt and oil that's losing its value is not going to help.
4872 2018-01-24 15:11:16 My end goal with intercropping is a cereal, a pulse, and an oil seed on every acre every year. In order to be widely adopted, I think the system needs to be easy. @ me with issues with this!
4873 2018-01-24 15:11:15 Texans don’t have much coal capacity anyway they prefer that a bubblin crude, oil that is, black gold, texas tea
4874 2018-01-24 15:11:11 Gotta celebrate this weekend!!!! As i take a new career path!!!!! No more long hours and long days in the oil field

4877 2018-01-24 15:11:06 That would be awesome if we could sell them our oil.
4878 2018-01-24 15:10:59 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
4879 2018-01-24 15:10:37 Ive been using oil, they said they were sellin you kush?? Fuckkked up

4881 2018-01-24 15:10:21 Even richer that @CThompsonAFPM isn’t aware that corn #ethanol receives NO subsidies.  Oil does, of course, and PES has benefitted from lots of taxpayer funded subsidies to prop up its antiquated facility.  Stop scapegoating the RFS when you know this refinery’s issues are legion

4886 2018-01-24 15:09:40 Hahah which essential oil did she break?
4887 2018-01-24 15:09:30 2. Objector also generally must establish conflict and bring to court's attention. Sun Oil.
4888 2018-01-24 15:09:30 Many wells and drilling facilities owned by companies that went bankrupt have been abandoned without proper cleanup. These deserted rigs have been nicknamed “orphaned wells”, and are beginning to worry oil and gas commissioners #oilandgas #wells #abandoned #bankruptcy #rig #ENN
4889 2018-01-24 15:09:29 Yes I believe an unregulated market would solve the situation. Venezuelans have always been very entrepreneurial so if they eliminate all controls of the economy we'll have a chance. Oil money isn't really important when you can import raw materials to produce and export anything
4890 2018-01-24 15:09:24 Fight Schumer do not give in to him  He is a snake oil politician he has a fork tongue    do not trust him !!!!!!
4891 2018-01-24 15:09:19 And is it payment for #TrumpSolarTariff that will cost 28,000 Amer jobs and raise price of oil for Koch Bros and #Putin
4892 2018-01-24 15:08:54 How stupid are you to think that you're using a communication device right now that depends on coal

China is ramping up its use of coal

When solar and wind fail, oil natural gas coal-fired generation comes online
I believe it's 6000 products at a minimum come from coal

4895 2018-01-24 15:08:03 Hey, come on man. It was a super-long time ago. A time before we dipped our bread in oil before dinner.
4896 2018-01-24 15:07:53 big oil signed a secret treaty with the presidents brother how long do they think they can hide that
4897 2018-01-24 15:07:52 But his oil drilling friends can buy a new yacht so it's all good.

4903 2018-01-24 15:06:49 I look forward to this - my light isn't on but I know it needs an oil change but it gets inspected next month so I've been putting it off so I only have to take it in one time
4904 2018-01-24 15:06:45 GST will appreciate the prices further . We Import most of oil  from abroad but #ministers never understand that. Successive failures of #Indian Governments to construct strategic oil reserves is the cost we have to pay to meet our demands.
4905 2018-01-24 15:06:35 Yeah I've heard mixed reviews on deva curl and I'm not trying to waste money on products that won't work for me lol but thanks I'll check the oil out !!!

4908 2018-01-24 15:06:15 so it's better now? whether that's true or not. And I don't think it is true. They have the biggest oil reserves in the world and they are importing oil now. Hmm???

4915 2018-01-24 15:05:18 What’s so ghetto about olive oil?
4916 2018-01-24 15:05:12 Hirap na nga in general but IT IS IN EVERYTHING. Like ketchup. Or salad dressings (no dressing in Salad Stop is sugar free, kahit "lemon and oil.") Or marinades (esp here in the PH). KAHIT SMOKED SALMON. HOW DID WE GET HERE

4923 2018-01-24 15:04:38 I KNOW but omg so I just went to take my car into this place to get the thing fixed and like... they said I didn't have an appointment??????? So I took my free oil change and left
4924 2018-01-24 15:04:32 Oh yes. This woman described how she puts her kid upside down and drops oregano oil “in both his nose holes”

To my knowledge, it’s incredibly irritating and burns on contact with skin. Imagine it on mucous membranes??
4925 2018-01-24 15:04:21 Rob is doing a presentation on economics of oil and shit like that. His classmates are enthralled. There are graphs and shit. I’m massively hungover and I have no idea what’s going on... but hey I have a British accent.
4926 2018-01-24 15:04:09 If Nigerian leaders can misbehave with free oil money, why should they do any better with free tax money?

4930 2018-01-24 15:04:00 You know, if you tried deep-frying it, you probably wouldn't even need any additional oil. So convenient!
4931 2018-01-24 15:03:55 Astana...
Guess regime sees better options with talks.
1. Somehow get along with oppostion (and Turkey) to build a united Syria; even may lead to end of Assad, but pro-Assad have a shared seat
2. Risk partition of a nation, only Assad in power, no oil income

Trust must be build
4932 2018-01-24 15:03:40 And oil spills and environmental destruction will be the price. STUPID pro fossil fuel policies and taxing solar imports are poisoning our beautiful country for our children and grandchildren. All for “soaring profits” for and dark money from, your energy goons.

4940 2018-01-24 15:03:11 Canada is a rich oil region. Canada has ever since encourage offering cash bonus to its citizens to have more children not abort them. Canada can afford its healthcare without leeching tax payers & they can pay enough doctors not like the corrupted veteran hospitals in America.
4941 2018-01-24 15:03:08 Well done Mr. President.  Yet another brilliant executive order to cancell out Obama's attempts to sabotage America's growth & independence in  oil.

4948 2018-01-24 15:02:42 Do you think a free unregulated market would work in Ven ? Would oil money trickle down? I hear Chevron and others made fortunes under Chavez but it didn’t trickle down would it do so if you had a new govt. ?
4949 2018-01-24 15:02:34 Is the Jr Minister competent enough to run the Oil Ministry? Is Fashola and Amechi competent? Most Nigerian Businesses and Politicians can't survive generally without being dubious.

4953 2018-01-24 15:01:59 Some more thoughts on #shale EOR from #HFTC18: Since shale reservoirs are oil-wet, surfactants can be used to alter wetability to water-wet. This should trigger oil to be transfer from rock matrix, into flow paths aka open fractures.
4954 2018-01-24 15:01:58 do you mean long oil?

4966 2018-01-24 15:00:42 Maybe they should use the earthquake of the coast of Alaska and the potential resultant tsunsmi, as an example of why oil drilling in the ocean is a huge threat to our food supply and environment.
4967 2018-01-24 15:00:40 No, they stay rich by pulling oil from the earth and keeping the proceeds in the hands of a theocratic oligarchy
4968 2018-01-24 15:00:36 How about the possibility the 23k jobs could be loss because of your father’s proposal 30% tariff on solar panels. Solar panels = clean energy not coal or crude oil.

4987 2018-01-24 14:59:19 How these politicians fool people on one hand 40% tax is laid for fuel which nobody talks. When crude oil is imported how you blame centre govt for price hikes. So first make Tamil Nadu govt reduce taxes and bring it under #GST. @CMOTamilNadu please do a detailed analysis.

5012 2018-01-24 14:56:27 @TheJR Very sad news to report, Howard Shatto passed away Sunday.  Howard was the father of Dynamic Positioning as well as the pioneer in the use of Remotely Operated Vehicles for use in offshore oil exploration and production.  He will be missed by many.
5013 2018-01-24 14:56:08 @Ford - lagging on #ElectricCar’s -Fighting rules that reduce pollution & oil consumption - Sad.
5014 2018-01-24 14:56:06 It's also a Russia thing. Russia's economy is dependent on oil. Keeping other countries using it is important to them. And they own us now, so...
5015 2018-01-24 14:56:02 It’s not the oil. It’s a Sunni(Saudi Arabia) vs. Shia(Iran) thing. The slaughter of this is a proxy war being waged by outside powers much like what’s happening in Syria and what happened in Lebanon.
5016 2018-01-24 14:55:58 I'm a united fan but I agree with u chip why didn't wenger just sell him at the start of the this at point u lot were fierce completion now that's all changed I should do a Diss track for wenger for fucking up the team again it will be oil next

5019 2018-01-24 14:55:34 Isn't oil Russia's most profitable export?
5020 2018-01-24 14:55:33 Yeah and the oil rich nations are destabilizing. In the end it my not be worth it at all, and the way forward has always been to diversify. Other sectors of the energy economy would also "soar" if we underwrite them with tax dollars like we do oil and gas.

5022 2018-01-24 14:55:11 Umm it's been claimed that Turkey was a strong partner against IS but didn't Turkey buy plundered oil from IS also?
5023 2018-01-24 14:55:11 And 210 Thousand gallons of oil that has spilled two months ago just happened to slip your mind?
5024 2018-01-24 14:55:00 LOL just use water instead of oil
5025 2018-01-24 14:54:44 So when Corbin gets elected he'll be moving all the countries assets into oil then? Also loving the Ben Garrison avi great touch
5026 2018-01-24 14:54:44 Try some lavender oil LS!
5027 2018-01-24 14:54:37 Trump cares about where he can get money - oil & gas. He doesn't care about the environment or solar energy. And since he's so stupid that he thinks if the wind stops blowing, wind energy won't work, just what does any1 expect from this moron. @RealDonaldTrump
5028 2018-01-24 14:54:37 The president must own oil stock in Kremlin.
5029 2018-01-24 14:54:24 Suuure! They promise jobs but then take the extra tax-relief money, pay out bonuses, and lay workers off. THIS is a trend you should be following--as well as lifting up renewable resource jobs. Oil is dead. If you can't look ahead, we're gonna be left behind. #youfucker

5031 2018-01-24 14:54:13 I agree on this sentiment. instead of investing in the tech or at least bringing it here to wean us off oil / coal they are explicitly trying to turn the clock back 30 years
5032 2018-01-24 14:53:55 I think I want to do an oil paint "goddess series" 
5033 2018-01-24 14:53:54 Revelation 6  6.And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of  wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see  thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

5035 2018-01-24 14:53:45 How come in the @tasty videos you never see oil flying all of the place? When I pan fry even one piece of chicken, my kitchen looks like a 5 gallon bucket of oil got massacred all over my stove & walls..

5040 2018-01-24 14:53:09 @StefNicole I watched the oil video last night Ike you told me to.. now I have questions. Herbivore?  Caudalie vine overnight detox? DE Marula? I have combo oily skin and acne prone.. what’s my best option?
5041 2018-01-24 14:53:07 ..but Arabs think differently abot pakis:-) 

End of the day arabs too look at their own interests. Saudi cut off free oil to pak long time back. Pak is net negative for them. They realised this. China is another story..
5042 2018-01-24 14:53:05 the first one looks like an oil painting
5043 2018-01-24 14:52:56 The most overrated snake oil salesmen.  It starts in kindergarten with teachers wearing their college shirts. Telling kids they can’t be successful without it.  Our schools goal is 100% continuing education.
5044 2018-01-24 14:52:55 Coconut oil cause a dry beard is unacceptable lol
5045 2018-01-24 14:52:43 $XOP more relative weakness, $SPY green out of the gate while XOP lags in the red with oil also down -.6%. Would like to try a bounce long at 39.50, so long as SPY is green. EIA at 10:30 could save the day, not gambling through that number, especially after yesterdays API build
5046 2018-01-24 14:52:43 Figures excluded Oil & Gas.Why was that ?
5047 2018-01-24 14:52:31 So apparently I'm allergic to avocado now. My hair dye had avocado oil in it and my head is itchy and my skin has welps where the dye was. 
5048 2018-01-24 14:52:30 Ashely Irons for @unitedresponse: The medication regime as far as it relates to bowel movements was fybogel and laxido; cod liver oil was mentioned?

5050 2018-01-24 14:52:14 Ugh the worst, sorry. Try peppermint oil on the temples and under the nose, peppermint tea, BC powder, and/or putting your hands/feet in ice cold water. If you can get a prescription try Maxalt.
5051 2018-01-24 14:52:07 Or in a universe where the Villains foundations hold energy stocks and big oil owns a chunk of the White House.
5052 2018-01-24 14:51:45 Hurting the green energy industry benefits coal and oil.
5053 2018-01-24 14:51:45 Yeah I didn’t either until I saw it on the website and it was always sold out. I’ve also tried the gold oil and after trying it I couldn’t stand the smell and changed my mind about buying any other ones.
5054 2018-01-24 14:51:43 "Ripple effects" is kind. "Cataclysmic effects" is more to scale. Ironically enough, already, oil platforms in Alaska anchored in permafrost are starting to destabilize and leak and sinkholes are opening in Russia. These are only augurs. This is only the beginning. #ClimateChange
5055 2018-01-24 14:51:43 People with perfect skin: use coconut oil to take off your makeup  that shit clogs pores and does not come off properly which is not good at all for acne prone skin smh stop suggesting this
5056 2018-01-24 14:51:43 @wingoz just made me hungry for a fried peanut butter sandwich.  Is this something that I can fry with oil in a pan or do I need a deep fryer to pull it off properly?

5059 2018-01-24 14:51:26 DC voted 94% for Hillary.  Trump knew who all of them voted for.  It is one big Good Ol Boy Club "Secret Society" who have stolen trillions from the American people and other countries with guns, drugs and oil.

5064 2018-01-24 14:50:42 When I used to dye my hair until it's death every weak I'd literally soak my hair in coconut oil and put a like bath cap on it and let it sit for an hour it helped soooo much
5065 2018-01-24 14:50:42 Easy, he gets money from oil or gas companies for doing this.

5067 2018-01-24 14:50:30 Did Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page meet with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft as the dossier alleged? The answer is yes so no the dossier hasn't been proven to be fabricated.

5076 2018-01-24 14:49:14 Not if you count our nature... and our obsession with making lots of holes through the ground. Either to drill for oil or making tunnels.

We should stop buying oil from these assassins.
5079 2018-01-24 14:48:49 Oh, that's not good. That car needs at least a pint of oil, pronto.

5087 2018-01-24 14:47:56 I've never had a peanut butter sandwich- neither has my brother. The smell alone makes me gag, but my mom loves #peanutbutter. I admit that I occasionally tempt fate taking a Benadryl or something to eat at restaurants that cook food in peanut oil tho.

5089 2018-01-24 14:47:50 Currents are important, since the oil collects in great floating baskets of coral vines that could get carried offshore.

5093 2018-01-24 14:47:06 How about some pure Eucalyptus essential oil? And echinacea-goldenseal herbal extract. Don't forget vitamin C. And brothy split pea soup with lots of veggies in it. Warm bath with Epsom salts. And then let the cold/flu run its course!
5094 2018-01-24 14:47:05 Mr. Pradhan, reduce the oil price. No need for any further talk. Have you checked whether the oil companies are colluding with Mota bhai? Or else why the price is 150% higher now with crude @ $60,  than the price when crude was @ $100? Care to reply?

5096 2018-01-24 14:46:57 There was recently a oil tanker which is leaking oil in the China sea. It is dumping millions of gallons of oil.

5101 2018-01-24 14:46:22 I can tell you their position on importing oil for commercial purposes = NFW. Apparently their plan is for Canada to be an export only nation when it comes to cannabis.

5135 2018-01-24 14:44:04 always thought Big Oil hedged their bets (vertical and horizontal integration.) Now instead of betting black and red at Roulette they are betting it all on a single number-Electric Vehicles. What if they are wrong? What if they have made the wrong bet? What are the consequences?

5152 2018-01-24 14:42:33 Excellent interviews with @SecNielsen and @SecretaryPerry The USA can lead countries to freedom with our energy without committing troops to fight wars for the oil in the Middle East #DrillHereDrillNow
5153 2018-01-24 14:42:33 Thank you Eugene Wilkie@NOW1SOLAR for making my day. GOP=Old Guys & Old Oil Money making a stand against Solar for ordinary hard working Americans.  Americans people are savvy & inventive.  They will be beating a path to the Solar Door anyway. Small companies rule the future
5154 2018-01-24 14:42:22 It is really sad to see all the people who are not billionaires trying to defend the obscene divergence of wealth in our world. Why do ordinary British people want oil sheiks and Russian oligarchs and Monaco tax exiles to keep their billions? Go Oxfam! Decent folk are with you.

5156 2018-01-24 14:42:11 I reckon it’s the oil. The fish have soooo much oil on them.
5157 2018-01-24 14:42:08 I have taken a sick day. I dragged a sleeping bag into the bathroom and steamed my sinuses while I filled a bath with hot water, olbas oil and epsom salt, then I got in the bath, then I showered off. Oz sat outside and sang me the song of his people for much of this.
5158 2018-01-24 14:42:04 Not stovetop - but we drizzle them with olive oil and season them with salt and pepper, sometimes garlic, whatever you like, really... and then roast them. They are great on their own, or tossed on a salad, etc.

5163 2018-01-24 14:41:29 I have always wished to have a look at the RVR Concession, Oil exploration and drilling contracts and see how skewed they're. Was surprised at how easy the RVR concession was terminated.
5164 2018-01-24 14:41:24 DJT killing an important industry (we should be leading) to help a failing industry at the end of its cycle (oil) to pay off his allies and sponsors. An outrage.
5165 2018-01-24 14:41:06 Silly comment. Just pointing out a fact. There were many reasons that Oil fell but overbullish sentiment was certainly one of them. If you followed me you would know I use multiple tools, not just TA or FA or sentiment, etc., ALL of them 
5166 2018-01-24 14:41:03 It was the oil crash that caused the p[roblems

The US wanting to protect $ imperialism attempt to topple the democratically elected gov in Ven
5167 2018-01-24 14:41:00 @realDonaldTrump supports oil and gas at all costs to the detriment of economy and environment.  @StateDept Sec Tillerson in that position is emblematic of this twisted philosophy.
5168 2018-01-24 14:40:59 $SRUNW been adding like crazy almost everyday past few weeks as institutions have taken notice after the keynote at the $GS oil conference for $SRUN . This is exactly how we got involved with $CDEV when it started. Riverstone same private equity backer of both.

5178 2018-01-24 14:40:02 Nationwide, there were 101 oil & gas-related fatalities in 14 states in 2014, the most recent year for which data is available from the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health. Most of those occurred in Texas, Oklahoma & North Dakota, all of which have robust activity
5179 2018-01-24 14:40:00 Also note that falling oil prices is the top factor depressing Russia's economy. So this is for Putin.
5180 2018-01-24 14:39:59 Hearing now that sanctions imposed by EU on govt officials. And crude oil is now trading in euros. Dollar hold getting weaker - plus a bizarre cryptocurrency ? Is that correct ?

5190 2018-01-24 14:38:51 Are those 9.8 million seeing anything?  Oil companies already paid  virtually no income tax.  They didn’t need any more money to stuff in their pockets.
5191 2018-01-24 14:38:51 What R the Democrats going 2 do abt 30% tariff on solar panels, an assault on the environment 2 help big Oil again. This will put many thousands of ppl out of work, close businesses, help China 2 continue 2B the leader in CLEAN energy. No rationale/justification except STUPIDITY!

5272 2018-01-24 14:29:54 inflation gone up?? how much? 1 or 2 %? how idiotic of you to compare 10%  of UPA 2 inflation to current 4% inflation. so for u, crude oil covered 6% of inflation??
5273 2018-01-24 14:29:50 I don't believe on what the article says, especially on the part where it mentioned cannabis was part of the holy oil, that could've been invented.
5274 2018-01-24 14:29:47 And by the way, the inflation of the '70s was due entirely to the quadrupling of oil prices.
5275 2018-01-24 14:29:28 If tax is imposed on oil that is being exported INTO USA (ie. USA is buying it) doesn’t that mean USA is paying the cost

5285 2018-01-24 14:28:22 Regular old witch hazel! It is a toner in and of itself, you don’t necessarily have to mix anything into it, but u can if u want! Rosewater and tea tree oil and maybe a lil of ur favorite serum would work! Toners balance the ph level in ur face!

5287 2018-01-24 14:28:18 Hello, thanks for your tweet. Our ATB differentials use the same oil recommended by the vehicle manufacturer. For the QBE15Z, we recommend a fully synthetic 75W90 oil with a GL4 rating. We use Titan Race oils, formerly Silkolene. Best wishes
5288 2018-01-24 14:27:59 HESITATION OF OIL COMPANIES ON PRICE  REVISION But how  long could  they control the price revision? GOI in consultation with the August bodies of Parliament may have to come out with concrete proposals for reducing present price impact

5293 2018-01-24 14:27:36 And all seemed well here as long the oil prices were in $100 per barrel, because chavismo would subsidize EVERYTHING through the oil rent - everything imported. But thanks to its rampant corruption, extreme controls to the economy that won't let production, and fall in oil prices

5314 2018-01-24 14:25:04 @SecretaryPerry @energy have no agency or Congress 2 stop u. Once u get ur war, probably w/Iran, price of oil skyrockets.  You've built a "GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL" around fossil fuels. It allows u to control energy imports and renewable energy can't be exported. U sell this 2

5322 2018-01-24 14:24:17 No, it's consistent with him pulling out of the Paris Agreement. He wants to Make America Depend on Oil and Coal.

5324 2018-01-24 14:24:10 Listening to guys whisper about how much they enjoy whipping coconut oil & adding essential oils to it. "You can cook with it too, I guess." Also, they use lotion after their runs; it tingles on their sore muscles. "It probably has that tea tree oil, is what it is."
5325 2018-01-24 14:24:04 Thank you so much babe!. I drink a lot of water. I use Nivea perfect & Radiant as a face wash, Neutrogena visibly even daily moisturizer and at night I wash my face with the Nivea Perfect & Radiant face wash and put coconut oil before I sleep

Where is his solidarity with Kurds in Syria?
5331 2018-01-24 14:22:54 ... Began his bolivarian revolution's plunder process of the private property, turning into State owned all the main enterprises and industries that did not kneel to him: I'm talking about the seeds industry, the oil industry, even many farms through an agrarian reform
5332 2018-01-24 14:22:48 Look at the money leagues in Europe, like the EPL.
Most of them are over because they are already won by oil sheiks buying up clubs like City & PSG
If you want meaningless football look no further.
5333 2018-01-24 14:22:33 Went to @jiffylube in november and now my car is leaking oil. Im at my mechanic now hoping it is an easy fix. They said whoever did the oil change did something with the oil plug. Never again.
5334 2018-01-24 14:22:13 Before oil,  before modern production of whisky etc, before the digital and renewables sectors : the list goes on. The amount of Scotland's cash must be much more by now

Just when we are complaining about fuel/oil scarcity. Some wicked people have secretly reduced the oil inside Titus sardine.

5347 2018-01-24 14:21:28 Console yourself in the knowledge that rUK cannot cease trading with an independent Scotland. They need our oil, water and electricity for starters
5348 2018-01-24 14:21:09 It’s crazy that BP is still playing hundreds of thousands of dollars to people from the oil spill
5349 2018-01-24 14:21:09 The irony of you talking about money, your an oil tycoons play thing,make no mistake about that. 
5350 2018-01-24 14:21:01 I hear ya! There’s as much washing up for one as for four with some recipes. 

One of my one pan faves. Defrost some non-fall-y apart veggie sausages. Chop into chunks. Heat oil in wok/big frying pan. Chuck sausage chunks in, stir about a bit. 3-5 mins. Chuck in gnocchi.

5353 2018-01-24 14:20:42 I thought it was very interesting that it is believed Jesus used cannabis oil to cure people.
5354 2018-01-24 14:20:38 Oil is running at a huge loss 
5355 2018-01-24 14:20:24 Amazon! $15. It's oil based. So I try not to use it too much. 3 times a week is usually good for my hair!
5356 2018-01-24 14:20:23 That delay in appointing ministers and taking a decision on fuel subsidy cost us a lot more than the drop in oil prices. It removed what little confidence investors had in this administration and resulted in their reluctance to bring their money back in.

5361 2018-01-24 14:19:47 Good point but you should at least add a screenshot of the price of crude oil which is our main source of living in Nigeria under gej and pmb. Just for d record.

According to their service manager I was lucky to get an oil change before I bought it. Some used cars they sell don't even get that.

5377 2018-01-24 14:17:32 Obama was always with wall-street and Big Oil. His "shutdown" was a huge gift to ETP as it took the wind out of the sails of the movement at a time where it was peaking. I wish more people saw this.

5532 2018-01-24 14:00:37 Shame on you for placing tariffs on solar panels to protect dozens of jobs at two companies, Suniva & Solar World, which will slow adoption of solar power in the US; increasing our dependency on foreign oil and costing thousands of high paying solar installation jobs.

5547 2018-01-24 13:58:48 There are more jobs in the solar energy sector than are in coal/oil/natural gas COMBINED, but more than 98% are in installation/support, not manufacturing. This tariff will make panels more expensive & decrease demand for installations in the long run. This isn't that hard.

5553 2018-01-24 13:58:27 I would like to know . If everything is so good then why is gas prices so high and oil is at an all time low  #SchumerShutdown
5554 2018-01-24 13:58:20 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
5555 2018-01-24 13:58:19 I find that if you roast them with oil and a lot of garlic, and then drizzle melted butter on them, and then throw them in the garbage and order a pizza, they're amazing!
5556 2018-01-24 13:58:15 Oil and gas industry responsible for the steady destruction of life industry's dodged regulations and built hundreds of pipelines, spoil banks—that have systematically destroyed the water quality and created so much pollution living organisms suffocate. We want laws and FINES!
5557 2018-01-24 13:57:58 Ugh just been having issues with my oil tank.  just filled it less than a month ago 350$ worth and then less than a month later they show up and it's another 350$  doesn't make sense
5558 2018-01-24 13:57:45 I rebuke you in the name of our lord and savior! your not a preacher your a snake oil salesman & con artist!
5559 2018-01-24 13:57:40 bank of america is obscene... they also invest in oil pipelines big time... they only like rich people too.
5560 2018-01-24 13:57:32 just applied rosehip oil on my blemishes, VCO for my eyebrows, and aloe to the rest of my face im a skincare vlogger now
5561 2018-01-24 13:57:21 I dunno. Coal mining’s not for everyone. Making pipeline isn’t growing fast. How many retail workers would work on oil rigs? Farming? Trumps living in a fantasy world.
5562 2018-01-24 13:57:15 Not sure if I can still fit in my Daffyd costume, but I guess I'll just have to oil myself plenty.
5563 2018-01-24 13:57:13 So £29.8 billion + oil and gas revenue + 100% of all taxes raised would mean??? Hey that would mean we'd be better off being Independent.
5564 2018-01-24 13:57:07 Thank you!! My trick: I actually leave a good heavy conditioner in my hair and then add a little “Moroccan Oil cream for curly hair.” If my wallet is looking empty I use Herbal Essences’ mousse.

5566 2018-01-24 13:57:03 pesto, olive oil and Parmesan are all natural foods... (if you take the constituent parts of the sauce). Natural fats shouldn't have the bad rep they have had in the past... :) #realfood

5571 2018-01-24 13:56:38 Money managers have taken delivery of 250K contracts since Nov - where is that oil?
5572 2018-01-24 13:56:38 The govt. is trying to kill the solar power industry, putting a tarriff on a chinese company MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES.  If it stands, they'll need to close and 32k people will no longer have jobs.  Because you know, oil companies are important.

5575 2018-01-24 13:56:27 @PMOIndia we all know how much paid taxes come back to the people in forms of government works to improve condition. Then, why allow states to keep prices of oil this high and not give a direct benefit to people? #GST #Petrol #tax #taxes
5576 2018-01-24 13:56:23 Not going to happen. Russia needs to sell their oil. Trump is pro Russia, pro oil.  The solar panel embargo will cost thousands of US jobs. 

Long ago the US turned it’s back on wind & solar tech. China took solar tech. Germany took wind tech. US stood by oil/coal.

5581 2018-01-24 13:55:48 Currently, oil price is highest in last 3 years. But yeah, when the prices were low govt didn't pass on the benefits, instead used the opportunity to earn by increasing the taxes.

5607 2018-01-24 13:52:37 Time to change the oil in Debbies hair.
5608 2018-01-24 13:52:32 The US is on track to produce more oil than Saudi Arabia in 2018. If you want to make some money invest in $SND $STO or $XOM.

5626 2018-01-24 13:50:25 i found out from mr aria that even though we blame the government for the price of petrol and all, at the end of the day, it all ends up to whether the world oil market price changes.. cause it cannot go far from what it’s valued.
5627 2018-01-24 13:50:22 #hyr oil $70+ and we are looking at a total turnaround in business.  Fully funded with a small free float. This could be the first  bagger of the year  on AIM with update due Monday. ..

Russia is only the biggest player in the oil industry and you're here trying to paint the whole "Russian angle" as being nothing more than a boogeyman that doesn't exist?

Fact: Russia is the TOP PRODUCER OF OIL.

Of course Trump would try to please Putin.

5650 2018-01-24 13:47:32 it was a oil refinery, because turkey is just their to break stuff for the Americans and create chaos that they can be payed to fix later
5651 2018-01-24 13:47:30 America is not only self-sufficient now but is exporting oil. Inventories are still historically high. That's why they're not buying at these prices. Give it another 3 months of inventory drawdown.  #wtic #eurusd #tradingpsychology

5734 2018-01-24 13:35:37 The market continued to receive support from strong earnings results as more than 80% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly earnings have beaten estimates. There was also strength in energy stocks as the price of crude oil climbed +1.42%.
5735 2018-01-24 13:35:34 Agreed, there are definitely some fats worse than others.  I tend to think we were meant to consume fats through the trace amounts found in foods.  For example, olives contain trace amounts of oil, I don't think we were intended to drizzle the oil of 1000 olives on our greens
5736 2018-01-24 13:35:24 Of course not. Olive oil is a healthy fat, basil is practically a green vegetable and Parmesan is calcium.

5744 2018-01-24 13:34:10 No they won’t.  Liberal companies like Starbucks and Apple are sharing the tax benefits with employees.  Wake me up when an Oil company does anything resembling this.

5773 2018-01-24 13:30:31 Some states take for them some industries, like Venezuelan oil industry. But I don't know if that can be called wealth, 'cause they create that wealth by a legal prerrogative to profit by it at the expense of the tax payer individuals' money that subsidize the industry's errors

5794 2018-01-24 13:27:23 People should stop blaming government. Petrol diesel prices are directly related to global oil prices.

5809 2018-01-24 13:25:31 Do be careful w/ the tea tree oil if you have dogs. Toxic for them. Good luck w/ the “ L word”, as we call it. I won’t even say the word out loud in our house!!

5811 2018-01-24 13:25:13 1) The policy hasn't changed since 2010. 2) The policy was approved by the Queen. 3) This story is design to distract from some positive news about Scotland economy revealing that it exports 40% of its goods outside of the UK (excluding oil & gas) & not 20% as claimed by UKGovt.
5812 2018-01-24 13:25:07 Today someone told me “I don’t want to be absurdly rich, just rich enough to where I can always change my car oil whenever it needs it” lololol
5813 2018-01-24 13:24:59 Only if the rocks have oil 
5814 2018-01-24 13:24:56 @GMA @adriennebankert @RobinRoberts @EsplanadeAssn If you are going to do a snarky Philly meme, you might want to get it right. We didn’t use Crisco Oil in the poles, we used the shortening. As for banning cheesesteaks, ooh, our feelings are hurt. #FlyEaglesFly @Eagles
5815 2018-01-24 13:24:53 About 5K for oil change. For tires it vary s. Depending on the type of vehicle and conditions
5816 2018-01-24 13:24:52 Oil price went up in the past 2 and the govt of the day managed it well..

5821 2018-01-24 13:24:10 Commodities looking strong.

Why?

$USD price inflation. The dollar is continuing to degrade.

$crypto is an amazing hedge but so is $GLD $SLV(the physical stuff), oil, real estate.
5822 2018-01-24 13:24:01 Not ‘vastly’. The concern is China Brazil etc are catching them up. Note: the major meat consortiums are some of the largest investors in clean meat. They know the game’s up, just like oil/gas investment in renewables. It’s not ideology, it’s common business sense.
5823 2018-01-24 13:23:59 Norway also funds a lot of its welfare state through oil too.
5824 2018-01-24 13:23:58 Why? Just because we're not going to discount oil when NAFTA gets cancelled and we can reorient our resource marketing to Asia and we will get preferential access to Japan's economy and China will buy all our wheat and....
5825 2018-01-24 13:23:54 Seriously? The job outlook in the US for green jobs, was over 3 MILLION in the next 3-5 years. How many oil and coal jobs will be created? What kind of planet do you want to leave the next generations?  Didn’t we screw it up enough? No wonder you like trump
5826 2018-01-24 13:23:34 It's all in support of big oil and coal ..
The non-renewables instead of supporting green technology..
5827 2018-01-24 13:23:33 Venture to say those in the oil and gas industry does more and gives more to charity than smarmy opportunistic politicians.  Not that your implying anything in your post.

5833 2018-01-24 13:21:52 Your solar tariff is estimated to cost 23,000 American jobs. At this point it isn’t even about the money or the economy your just an asshole. Solar employs more than oil and coal industries combined!
5834 2018-01-24 13:21:46 Aside from the scam, is this the most bizarre “investment” ever? We’ve had non-existent property, woodland, oil, green-things and now truffles.

In fact why don’t we just buy a herd of pigs with our #Pensions - at least we’d be guaranteed bacon butties in our old age?

Ken Holland?
5838 2018-01-24 13:21:04 You are so full of bull! How about all the jobs that will be lost in the solar industry because of your tariff? We can't make those panels for less. We know you and your staff were bribed by oil and coal. We have to get past those dirty, inefficient and destructive power sources.
5839 2018-01-24 13:20:45 That coconut oil is a plus huh 
5840 2018-01-24 13:20:44 Yeah I see a lot of those complaints. Weird they can't find a mutually beneficial way for all to make money. Thank you...this has been fun, and I even forgot one I already knew and was huge here...Midnight Oil.
5841 2018-01-24 13:20:40 This tariff is inexcusable. The only way this makes sense is for America to become a leader in solar panel production. And that needed to happen before any such tariffs. He is just ball and chaining us to fossil fuels. Btw USA is leading world in oil production! BOOM MIND BLOWN!

5848 2018-01-24 13:20:04 Just got a sample bottle of CBD oil last week. Trying it out. No results yet, so am increasing dosage. Hmmm, thin mints taste would be good, the oil is kind of bitter
5849 2018-01-24 13:20:02 How about doing something about the causes that create these refugees. War Lords and occupying forces that terrorise indigenous people! And the government's hide the truth by media blackouts Unless there's oil/gas in that land then we're in there! Then "it's our moral duty"

5856 2018-01-24 13:18:57 Blame it on oil, blame it on realism, blame it on whatever you want, but Trump has finally realized that America doesn't need Iran, Pakistan, Hezbollah, Hamas, PLO & Co.
Actually, America doesn't give a $hit about them; and they better be very careful.

5868 2018-01-24 13:17:51 SIBC news: Figures from Highlands and Islands Airports Limited show that passenger numbers at Sumburgh Airport last year rose by nearly 14 per cent. As has been the case for years, this was due to increased oil and gas industry activity with fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.

5937 2018-01-24 13:08:22 Oil is 6 months or 5k miles, whichever comes first (you can usually push it a little more on newer cars, to around 7k). I have no idea about tires. I would ask next time you get your oil changed because I think it depends on how often you drive/how far you drive

6048 2018-01-24 12:51:43 I had some sticker shock at first, too! The first bottle of beard oil I bought was non-scented, cost $12, and came from Kroger (not a top shelf brand). Lasted a month. @beardbrand spiced citrus smells great, costs $25, but lasts 3 mths. Can’t beat those numbers.

6052 2018-01-24 12:51:05 Jobs jobs jobs, unless your job is part of the Solar energy field. With a 30% tariff bringing panels in, the cost of changing to solar is making it less profitable. Just wanna country needed, more dependency on oil, less jobs.

6073 2018-01-24 12:48:03 So, this means less pressure on the welfare state - yes?  With USD also at a Brexit high, the cost of crude oil must be falling and consequently reducing inflation and with very positive GDP growth figures isn't it time we find the money needed for the NHS?

6083 2018-01-24 12:46:47 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
6084 2018-01-24 12:46:41 If media understood that cars and oil are both on the way out, they would not be worried about Amazon. Amazon is simply going with the zeitgeist Trump and the car oil folk know is aimed right at them. Change happens regardless.

Also, if it can help someone else that has an inflammatory process, @CWHemp is an amazing product.

6134 2018-01-24 12:39:05 I think I want a spa day for my birthday. Facial, hot oil massage, mani/pedi...that sounds amazing to me and just what my body needs.
6135 2018-01-24 12:39:05 It's more relevant now than it was then. Back then hardly any oil has been discovered. Lately new fields with trillions of barrels have been discovered. Go back and think again.

6142 2018-01-24 12:37:21 #oilshock @sanket without fixing the economy why did govt remove subsidies whilst pocketing same & now after 4years when oil prices have gone high they talk of inheriting a slowing economy?! Ridiculous economics which does not require rocket science to understand.
6143 2018-01-24 12:37:16 Are governance now measured by oil price?? Since 1999, peak oil price was witness under the admin before GEJ
6144 2018-01-24 12:37:10 Another tip for y’all: coconut oil is notttt a moisturizer like everyone thinks. It only sits on the surface, it does not penetrate into your skin. Do not replace an oil for a moisturizer

6147 2018-01-24 12:36:09 Better answer! Still thinking refraction from high clouds, but perhaps from a bright flame/light at an oil refinery instead of "moon dog". @JohnSnellFox8 says the flare has been higher than normal too.

6228 2018-01-24 12:25:40 I personally have nothing to be happy about about the Rand being lower than R12. Well not until cooking oil and 60 large eggs are lower than R100

But psst, make sure the coconut still virgin aite 
6231 2018-01-24 12:24:54 @JudgeJeanine I'm casting a new Western movie and have 2 roles perfect for Schumer. Which should I pick? Schumer as the 'Snake Oil Salesman' or Schumer as the 'Snake'? I reckon he'd excel in either role..........

6236 2018-01-24 12:23:46 8yrs abi 13yrs what if the opportunistic Military rule from 1975 - 1979 where he spent Oil Boom money to host FESTAC 77 when other countries were buying technologies off the market with Oil windfall. Compare @govsingapore and Malaysia with @NGRPresident and see the obvious

6241 2018-01-24 12:22:22 Perhaps Mr Dale, we should declare our independence and be rid of your ridiculous posturing. Oh, and we'll be having none of your Barnett consequentials either. And we're keeping the fish. And the oil Be careful what you wish for.

6249 2018-01-24 12:20:26 Nothing to do with syphoning off profits from high oil prices to subsidise food etc and making some products cheaper than the price of production so that when the oil price fell there were no domestic producers left so it all had to be imported at a higher cost!

6251 2018-01-24 12:20:15 They checked the oil, they said it's coming from the actual engine... They didn't want me to drive it on account of the engine potentially blowing up :l I'd have paid them to find out what it was there and then but I'd already booked it in with someone else for the ticking!

6367 2018-01-24 12:04:20 Simon excellent point. And I agree. Would love to see a series of tweets from you explaining when our rivals were building stadiums and sponsors in 90 apart from oil money. We had our heads in the sand and we are still catching up

6504 2018-01-24 11:42:41 Its ok. I kind of make it up as i go along. I don't use turps as it smells so much, there are other solvents you can get. But yes i do a thin layer of oil paint first and let dribbles happen and then I use more paint as I progress. I probably don't do it technically right!!!
6505 2018-01-24 11:41:33 It's really good! It's 100% non stick so I don't even need to add oil or anything - perfectly cooked eggs EVERY TIME. Along with my other fried egg secret technique...

6512 2018-01-24 11:40:24 Act like the change you want, like the nation you are.

Scotland is in the perfect position to offer a full life-cycle space industry—from design, to build, to launch, to maintain—Scotland has the human and natural resources to be the world leader.

And it doesn’t require oil.
6513 2018-01-24 11:40:19 Why r we paying so much for gas when there is plenty of oil and more electric everyday.
6514 2018-01-24 11:40:12 Much like england has been receiving free oil revenues from Scotland for the last 40 odd yrs. Time for it to end. #indyref2

6521 2018-01-24 11:39:49 Well that's odd. Mundell & the other Tories have been telling us repeatedly that Scotland exports four times as much to (through?) the rUK than anywhere else, but now it seems it's a 40%/60% split, and that doesn't include oil and gas exports.Someone has been telling porkies...
6522 2018-01-24 11:39:49 #hottake for a guy (and party #GOP) that doesn’t like taxes why impose a 30% tax on solar panels? What’s the spin they put on it? - I mean obviously they are appealing to big oil and Russia.

6531 2018-01-24 11:38:00 Fish oil is great. You're right. I dont really need to take it. Especially not anymore. I used to take preworkouts because I was really weak. But I dont even need that anymore. I spend about an hour and a half working out and at the end I'm still fresh.
6532 2018-01-24 11:37:39 Nestea will solve the provlwm like they did in California when a similar provlem occurred. Just remember the CEO HOPES it happens often as possible. Thecrest of the world is too busy building oil pipe lines to care.
6533 2018-01-24 11:37:36 Since the investment in alternate sources of fuel was not previously done, oil prices continue to be supported.  Once the market starts factoring in shale, there will be less support for high oil prices. @raziakkhan #SCBMarketOutlook

6552 2018-01-24 11:34:38 Good Morning, this is in reference to @francescaonairr problem. A conventional oil change ranges around $20 to $40, now some vehicles do ask for synthetic oil, which could range $40 to $60. @WPOC

6642 2018-01-24 11:16:42 I'm no economist, but rising oil prices are not good for our economy. It sets us up for inflation not just because of energy cost but because oil is traded in dollars. Inflation is another way to tax lower income individuals by making wages worth less & hurting small savings.

6652 2018-01-24 11:15:16 So he is doing this to support the #KochBrothers and harm Americans by forcing them to pay higher prices for oil while limiting their access to renewable technology. Is that what you are saying?

6694 2018-01-24 11:06:50 The oil money is flowing into these hacks’ pockets at an alarming rate now.
6695 2018-01-24 11:06:44 In the past 2 weeks this is what has happened: my car had an oil change and I found out I needed a new timing belt, a new battery, a new water pump, new brakes, and a new strut. 
Ok that's about $2000 worth of repairs
6696 2018-01-24 11:06:43 beards finally at the point where i can justify buying beard products to keep that shit soft and prospering so i am gassed for this oil to go on sale
6697 2018-01-24 11:06:38 Consumers don’t need to worry about any of these … the same way they don’t have to worry about how many cylinders are in their engine or the type of oil that their car takes. They buy a Ford Focus or a Ferrari - they are both cars and drive on the roads
6698 2018-01-24 11:06:30 Thank you !!

6780 2018-01-24 10:51:06 Second solution bleach 50/50 with water. And few drops of tea tree oil. Preferably keep this solution in coloured bottle as light degrades. After using toilet three squirts of solution 1 then three squirts of solution 2. The two solutions work well together.
6781 2018-01-24 10:51:03 An oil producing country where people celebrate when their Vehicle Fuel indicator reads Full. So shameful.
6782 2018-01-24 10:50:45 Erdogan. The human flip flop. 

Hard to tell who he's trying to please on any given day.  One day ringing Isis oil for weapons, the next killing Kurds. One day its the ottoman empire, next getting rid of insurgents. The ultimate in dependant independents.

6844 2018-01-24 10:39:07 The plastic politicians and jaded journos sell snake oil branded with 'Great British patriotism'.   The 'RoyalFamily NobilityConservativesArmyBusinessSport' project of the ruling classes give people with nothing an identity. It is not much of one, but it is ALL THEIRS. Sad.
6845 2018-01-24 10:39:05 You just cost our travel industry 40k jobs & your new tariffs cost us another’s 60k jobs. You raised prices of solar panels making green power 30% more expensive to protect your coal, oil & Gas buddies.  You put a tariff on washing machines raising prices for all.  We are losing.
6846 2018-01-24 10:38:36 Could try enzymes in a attempt to convert the starch to sugar.  Or just use them to flavour a sugar wash.

6848 2018-01-24 10:38:27 1. If my memory serves, I said in EDITORIAL: Anticipating higher oil prices Jan 8, 2018 that what always troubled any sane minds was the real reason why the gov seemed to always have had low estimate of oil prices in its state budget. Back then, oil rose to $60, higher than....
6849 2018-01-24 10:38:21 Because domestic demand is so strong relative to trading partners..this will become increasingly prominent as capex picks...and oil price rise will also start to become more evident

6902 2018-01-24 10:28:09 I'm looking a little bigger picture at oil than I usually do so grain of salt - measured move to 75ish based on consolidation off the lows, Watching for a break over 65 to continue to that target.
6903 2018-01-24 10:27:43 Neoliberalism is incompatible with #ClimateAction . Same GHG standards as Harper(which we're on track to miss), oil and gas subsidies still in place, and supporting Kinder Morgan(despite local opposition in BC) indicates that little has changed the past two years.
6904 2018-01-24 10:27:22 Because we have free money from oil and gas we can't make ajaekuta steel mill to work. Simple thing in this country we can't do? Simple tricycle we can't produce.. We flood our country with other countries products?
6905 2018-01-24 10:27:17 Maybe May is a bad negotiator. Or maybe even JRM would fail to get a good deal when we are 1/6th of the size of the EU and our economy is six times more dependent on them than they are on us. Brexiters need to wake up and stop listening to snake oil merchants like JRM.

6913 2018-01-24 10:25:06 If someone came up to me, and said "we're fucking up the planet." I'd see the value in the statement do to the extensive waste of humans. The origin of a "climate denier" is oil companies. You're arguing on the side of a industry that benefits from being against science.

7048 2018-01-24 09:59:55 Malaysian palm oil price rebounds for 2nd day of gains on output decline

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian palm oil futures rose more than 1 percent in afternoon trade on Tuesday, rebounding from a sharp decline earlier in the session, lifted by bullish sentiment on falling production.

7060 2018-01-24 09:56:26 It was the sensation of holding the oil in the mouth and then swallowing, just made me heave. My other half also uses a CBD vape and she's never smoked, either. The efficacy of vaping is also higher than ingesting, so you really don't have to use it often.
7061 2018-01-24 09:56:00 How about we just let us keep all our own money, plus the oil receipts spent in England for the past 40 years and we’ll just go. London’s built on Scottish oil, so jog on you condescending arse.
7062 2018-01-24 09:55:57 The Extra Virgin Olive Oil is not Spanish, has not been Spanish and It will never be Spanish. What Greeks should say about this? They have more historical evidence that Olive oil was grown there first, what Italians should say too?
7063 2018-01-24 09:55:35 You fail to mention that most Muslim refugees are coming from countries torn by war from Western (UK!) oil interests. Too few people make the correlation. How many Muslim refugees come in the future depends entirely on Western foreign policy and energy politics

7084 2018-01-24 09:50:31 I say, based on 40 years of transatlantic transactions, it's preferable for the pound to be as low as possible to stimulate exports, BUT, psychologically, it's better when it's above 1.4 making travel costs & $ based imports, like oil, cheaper. It's about the Pound in your pocket
7085 2018-01-24 09:50:31 - Sir - reduce excise duties to soften the blow of escalating global crude oil prices. The common man is reeling!

7196 2018-01-24 09:26:01 Yes, I missed an underscore. He seems to be in anti-whistleblower mode right now. So the question is, why would a former employee of Siemens, CEO of a joint venture between (squeaky clean!) Siemens, the national oil company of Azerbaijan and others, be afraid of a whistleblower?

7253 2018-01-24 09:13:04 In both cases you might end up with an oil that doesn’t have things in it that you might personally want (for health benefits or whatever) but not much of what I’ve read from reputable sources has concerns it’s /unhealthy/ (as much as any oils are anyway)
7254 2018-01-24 09:13:03 and fractionated is when you spin it out (I assume) and take certain parts of the oil. If it was milk, you could spin out and just take the cream off for instance.

7263 2018-01-24 09:11:22 Fractionation also changes the viscosity of oil but mostly just divides up the raw product so it can be used for different purposes based on its chemistry - so some may be ideal for food, some for medicine etc.

7290 2018-01-24 09:04:21 Not saying there are no environmental impacts from batteries but, just to challenge your question, who is "we"? And who "ensures" oil extraction is done in a sustainable manner? Fact EVs have impacts too ≠ switching to EVs would be an improvement.

7631 2018-01-24 07:56:42 So historically low interest rates which have encouraged record amounts of govt, Corp, margin, consumer debt while at the same time inflating every asset class and yet not wages is success??   They’ve turned the economy into an oil drum of nitro glycerin. This is success to you?
7632 2018-01-24 07:56:24 Had to make sure they didn’t slide coconut oil in it before using it 
7633 2018-01-24 07:56:22 The chocolate has incredible flavor. I am concerned about the sunflower oil component though. Are there any potential negative health effects from the consumption of oils? How much sunflower oil is safe to drink each day?

7638 2018-01-24 07:54:44 Say yes to coconuts. BUT! Before that if you’re lips are cracked af I would do an oil and sugar scrub, then use oil as a moisturizer, then put Vaseline on top of that before you go to bed and your lips should be much better in the morning

7655 2018-01-24 07:50:40 Very funny. Thing is, the Alberta PCs long relied on Heritage Trust Fund income to prop up spending. No matter what the price of oil, no royalty income was transferred to the HTF after 1987. Thirty years. No oil revenue savings.

7683 2018-01-24 07:41:40 Fractionated means that they’ve heated it so the parts of the oil that solidify more readily are separated out. Interesterisation improves the taste and also the stability of the oil at room temp, but without the production of trans fatty acids that hydrogenation does.

8002 2018-01-24 06:40:26 Botswana is subsidized,Angola it's understandable it's an oil producer as for us oil cartels are extorting us....

8004 2018-01-24 06:40:12 Look, to me it's not about the corrupt oil marketers but the failure of the regulators
8005 2018-01-24 06:40:10 Finally, Obama de-regulated the oil industry in 2014, once again making us an exporter.  

Contrarily, Trump's 19th-century energy policy has driven energy prices up 7% (crushing the CPI and killing your buying power), and gas prices have gone up almost 10%.
8006 2018-01-24 06:40:00 nah, suruh beli inhaler aja kan pasti disana ada. kalo dia tau dia asma, pasti dia bawa inhaler kok. jadi pas asmanya kambuh, dianya gak repot. gak harus pake essential oil kok
8007 2018-01-24 06:39:58 It's not even much flourish required! Olive oil and salt and toss them in the oven.

There's more you can do clearly, but the basic is great.

I was converted to loving them about two years ago. Major improvement.
8008 2018-01-24 06:39:57 I know EXACTLY what fracking is. It's pumping a mix of water and toxic chemicals into the ground to force oil and gas out.
8009 2018-01-24 06:39:52 Not if its made with olive oil instead of butter, but I suppose that's only easy to find when it's home made.

8023 2018-01-24 06:38:13 I see.  A couple of notes  of possible interest:   a) China and Russia are building up their gold reserves pretty aggressively and China is offering gold-for-oil contracts.  b) going back to gold globally would have a good chance of causing capitalism to collapse.

8041 2018-01-24 06:34:39 Yeah, It would be hard to work. Other games like pubg are tying to make it an esport. It wouldn't be easy to do that. It wouldn't be great to watch either lol. I mean that's their goal. To make it an esport. I don't think they should though. bf and esports are like oil &water.

8043 2018-01-24 06:34:32 This is not a realistic solution to our Hydra problems.
Solutions with out socialism, communism or social democratic equality will not solve any economic or social problem.
U can keep selling oil well to private individuals and bridge the gap of inequality.

8046 2018-01-24 06:34:08 I don't see how he will do this. Small bus is hurting. Contracts are few. The revenue is down. The pipelines don't have social license. The costs of public sector high. Pension plans are a problem -should be defined contribution. Cheap easy oil gone; only fracking left. #cdnpoli

MAKE RUSSIA GREAT AGAIN is his real goal.
#TrumpRussia
8050 2018-01-24 06:33:48 Trump wants to get rid of all actual scientific study so that he can keep on saying that global warming is a hoax. Since science is proving him wrong, his oil and gas buddies stand to lose bucks. So he's blocking all reputable scientists from working anywhere in the government.
8051 2018-01-24 06:33:18 These Huns are better off using motor oil and a milking machine. Why do they bother a provider?

8064 2018-01-24 06:31:00 That's not true. We haven't even scratched the surface of our mineral potential. We already have gold, oil, coal, gas, gems.... We will find more as exploration continues.

8078 2018-01-24 06:29:07 What gives you the impression the USA is their only market? And they're taking steps to diversify away from oil. The commodities slump taught them an important lesson.

8094 2018-01-24 06:27:25 I concur. Risk / reward favors a rate hike next week as Powell steps into the Fed Chair coz it's not expected, dollar needs a boost, and rise in Oil provides the excuse. Gold is due a pullback before it takes off and this could be the catalyst.

8146 2018-01-24 06:18:18 David has always been bullish on Lander and outside of his lack of footspeed, there isn't much not to like about the player. I also called for him to be given another shot last year but not in place of Letestu, as the 12th/13th forward.
8147 2018-01-24 06:18:12 @mattymatheson. Bro what olive oil that I are using.. In the can. #enlighten
8148 2018-01-24 06:17:55 Damn!! People will come at u like you are one personally holding dia destiny
8149 2018-01-24 06:17:30 Oil is 95% of exports and they have to import literally everything, even gasoline.
8150 2018-01-24 06:17:17 But i would say probably an oil spill
8151 2018-01-24 06:17:06 Look at you not crushing my dreams today....Oilers already did it today
8152 2018-01-24 06:17:04 Erdogan had no issue allowing DAESH volunteers transit through Turkey. Erdogan had no problem buying stolen oil from DAESH. He does have a problem with Kurds living free of his control.
8153 2018-01-24 06:16:38 As I’ve said before, the Canadian Government needs to step up and act on Climate Change. Doing nothing but burning more oil isn’t the answer.
8154 2018-01-24 06:16:32 Tetsuyo Naito needs a hot oil treatment and leave-in conditioner, bless his heart. #njpw
8155 2018-01-24 06:16:29 Ohhh 100% i was hard on him to start but he’s certainly proved me wrong and couldn’t be happier for it. I’m glad he’s panning out so far, he’s put in a ton of work, to be quicker, better

But neither batches were good cuz I didn’t have veg oil so idk. 
Just sharing my thoughts I’m high af lol carry on
8158 2018-01-24 06:16:14 Trump is actively trying to end clean energy because of his oil guys.
8159 2018-01-24 06:15:51 bears would be better taking a long-term short on oil plays instead of gambling their $’s short-term against Li 
8160 2018-01-24 06:15:24 Sure but I'd be more than ok with 15 
8161 2018-01-24 06:15:13 Oil lamp or is that too obvious.
8162 2018-01-24 06:15:13 I had a discussion with a Biafran.He asked me these questions.
(1)If the oil rigs & oil reserves were located in the North,would Nigeria still be together till date?
(2)Can an Igbo be a governor in the North & vice versa?
(b)If possible,when?
These questions changed my mentality
8163 2018-01-24 06:15:13 I'm real interested in government surveillance. At present, however, I'm far more interested in what has been found on these Far Right Republican Russian Mafia FakeChristian Oil Oligarchs.
8164 2018-01-24 06:15:06 Oby should try and right any aptitude test from oil company... For me she really need employment.... For her information, there is no money to share as in the days of baba iyabor
8165 2018-01-24 06:14:59 True,fortunately he was signed to a rather  reasonable low risk contract .
8166 2018-01-24 06:14:55 Officials who take money from big oil, big pharmaceuticals and insurance companies or Wall St investment firms are never going to save us from big oil, big pharmaceuticals and insurance companies or Wall St investment firms.
8167 2018-01-24 06:14:52 I got tea tree oil in my beard. Not sure if I’m supposed to sleep with it but it smells weird. But it was like $15 bucks for a small thing of it. So i gotta use it all

8171 2018-01-24 06:14:32 I discovered micellar water this weekend and that's been pretty great.

Near as I can tell "micellar" is a fancy way of saying "we atomized oil and made it cooperate with water somehow through science and now you have emulsified oilwater you're welcome".
8172 2018-01-24 06:14:19 Our oil production is really high. Historically high. We have great reserves. Should we buy from the Kingdom anyway?

8181 2018-01-24 06:13:04 DamN I LOVE Coco with all my heart, but the creators of loving Vincent deserve some love and appreciation for making a fully animated movie WITH FULL ON OIL PAINTINGS FOR EVERY FRAME!!!! Like WHAT??!!!!! THAT IS INSANE
8182 2018-01-24 06:13:01 Or kept both on 4th line. But I would have kept Lander.
8183 2018-01-24 06:13:01 Or just quit the business before ALL of the Amazon has been cleared for palm oil plantations. Just sayin’
8184 2018-01-24 06:12:48 If you’re like me and like to vape oil instead of regular flower. I highly recommend the delta 9 2.0 carts. By one then use that to refill instead of buying a $30-50 cart every time.
8185 2018-01-24 06:12:42 Come on... too much salt bad for you but maybe you're just growing up and the problem slowly fading? How about the oil in those snacks? Less oil = better skin.. common sense. Don't do unhealthy stuff
8186 2018-01-24 06:12:36 oil of oregano pills are so gross but I s2g they help keep me from getting sick ??
8187 2018-01-24 06:12:36 I would have kept Lander over Letestu early in the year.
8188 2018-01-24 06:12:25 so let the water boil

goodbye to oil
8189 2018-01-24 06:12:23 they use that for birds in oil spills so it's gotta be safe to drink
8190 2018-01-24 06:12:16 Meanwhile, Trump imposes a 30% tariff on solar panels. Solar industry employs more people than coal and oil combined. More than 23,000 people will lose their jobs this year. (Don't forget upcoming Medicaid, Medicare, SS slashes to pay for $1.5 trillion deficit.) Winning bigly.

8193 2018-01-24 06:11:41 Sure, just saying that we’re no longer in that era. I don’t actually have any insight as to whether or not they’ll be better. Im just acknowledging I don’t know

8210 2018-01-24 06:09:23 There's no free market for healthcare when you're in a small town and having a heart attack, for instance.

And there no individual responsibility when oil leaks from pipes put in via govt land grabbing causes sickness.

I'd prefer a private system, but it's not sustainable.
8211 2018-01-24 06:09:17 So Dipshit has destroyed parks and monuments to allow fossil fuel extraction, plans to open basically every bit of ocean to oil exploration, and is now singlehandedly killing the US solar market. All when we need to be reducing fossil fuel usage.

8217 2018-01-24 06:08:22 Atheism doesn’t “manifest” anything. You can be atheist and pro-life or choice, a PETA board member or oil executive, a Democrat or Republican. It’s not prescriptive.

Theism applies to all of those as well.
8218 2018-01-24 06:08:18 I’m sure that oil will help her a lot.

8221 2018-01-24 06:08:03 Impervious surface runoff is the only obvious one I see. Nothing retention ponds can't take of. 

How is it, in any way, less environmental friendly than fracking, oil pipe leaks, oil platform disasters, tanker spills, burning coal, etc...
8222 2018-01-24 06:07:54 Arabs always think thay are superior to everyone else if it was not for their oil which in the first case thay did not know thay had thay would still be talking round the camp fires oh that still do that as well.

8254 2018-01-24 06:03:36 He certainly could but the thing that is concerning, is we have seen this song and dance before. It's all well and good to point to his off-ice struggles as the reason in the past but we have seen the same thing this year. Tough call.

8270 2018-01-24 06:01:00 Agreed. It will take a year or so to see the sekera of last season. Returning from major surgery like that is no joke. Most players rehab to get back and play but they aren't at their peak formance until much later.

8280 2018-01-24 05:59:24 They didn't drain them properly. Too much oil makes them soggy.

8301 2018-01-24 05:56:17 Given the parity and standings I think you can find a buyer for Maroon, Cammi, Letestu, Kassian, and Strome. The important part is to get enough picks back for them to acquire better parts at the draft.
8302 2018-01-24 05:56:16 @ItalianGrocery @gitlchefs @DiscoDavid9 @OldFashRecipes 
Does the olive oil you buy or sell have a HARVEST DATE on it?
8303 2018-01-24 05:55:54 Yeah, I'd only bring back Khaira as well. Kassian's way too much money for the role too. If they can't get him 3rd line TOI, he needs to go. Honestly not sure why they don't run him there for an extended run.
8304 2018-01-24 05:55:54 THE OIL GETS ON IT AND UGHHHHH
8305 2018-01-24 05:55:45 I still don’t understand....Trump just imposed 30% tariffs on solar parts from China...apparently to appease the oil industry. How does that fit with China buying him?
8306 2018-01-24 05:55:42 Push mo na to.
8307 2018-01-24 05:55:37 But trump and his cronies make make their money on oil. He will open up our coast, without our permission, and stop solar jobs all for HIS bottom line. We deserve a president who cares for THE PEOPLE over his pocket!

8312 2018-01-24 05:54:42 LRT I am also in love with their tiny bottles of oil. I got this tiny bottle of lavender oil for Christmas and spread it over my pillow for comfortable sleep~
8313 2018-01-24 05:54:40 It has....several times.......the Oil must have the record for “guttings”
8314 2018-01-24 05:54:35 I hate my bedtime routine sometimes. Shower, under eye serum, face lotion, body lotion, leave in cond, argon oil, blow dry hair, brush teeth, apply castor oil to lashes, chap stick... IM FUKKINNN TIRED j wanna sleep  #prettyhurts
8315 2018-01-24 05:54:29 Anybody who wants One Nigeria is making money. Division would affect their investments and income. For example, oil investors would lose everything if Nigeria breaks up. It’s the oil that’s still keeping us together.

8320 2018-01-24 05:54:05 The easiest part of an NHL roster to fill out should be bottom six forwards. So looking at the regulars the Oilers use in said role, how many would be worthy of bringing back next season? In my mind, Khaira is the only one but Caggiula & Kassian will also be back.
8321 2018-01-24 05:53:37 Yes, because what expresses Australia more than;

water bottled in china,
shoved into plastic derived from oil,

Nothing, right?

8327 2018-01-24 05:52:36 Months? Plant related maybe? I had a cat give me poison ivy once. Had oil on the fur from climbing a fence. Could be something being transferred to you with the way the cats wander and rub on everything.
8328 2018-01-24 05:52:22 Also we the People deserve royalty checks since the oil in America belongs to the People of America. Also IRS needs to Payback the people who have worked and they took their SS payments and collected them without turning them over to the SSA. In fact the CE at Oklahoma DOL is not

8357 2018-01-24 05:47:49 @nielsonTSN1260 I figured out what's wrong with the power play. The Oil are using our penalty killers during practice so they have like a 50% success rate. We need to outsource the penalty killers from the oil kings or something.
8358 2018-01-24 05:47:49 Heard guest say Fed Gov should step up, set policy. We have set policy. Got an idea she wouldn't like new policy any better.

8425 2018-01-24 05:34:16 I’d rather see more investment in development of private sector technology than (like Tesla even though they’re making bank by themselves right now). One day the technology will outperform oil. It’s going to happen, hopefully sooner than later. The market always adjusts.

8477 2018-01-24 05:27:48 That can be easily fixed with some smart signings and/or small trades in the off-season. The fact they have limited scoring depth on this roster isn't as easily addressed...unless they go the UFA route.
8478 2018-01-24 05:27:33 100% Paul. The teams ahead of the Oil can go 500 here on out and they would still finish ahead of the oilers. It’s over...

8486 2018-01-24 05:26:35 You're mistaken.
8487 2018-01-24 05:26:24 yeah you mean 9 fewer goals for and 5 more this season than last. You made it sound the other way around.
8488 2018-01-24 05:26:05 do you tone with a specific tea tree toner or just the essential oil??
8489 2018-01-24 05:26:03 What’s wrong with the Oil?
8490 2018-01-24 05:26:01 I found something online cus I have the same problem. Rubbing baking soda on your chest or back w/ a wash cloth then rubbing on some tea tree oil dries it up and clears it faster, these specific hormone break outs don’t require all that acne treatment shit

8512 2018-01-24 05:22:53 Your last sentence doesn't seem right to me. Are you sure?
I don't remember our goal differential coming close to -20 ever last season. They are at -23. If they scored 9 fewer than what we are right now we would be at -32 and 5 more allowed get us to -37.!!
8513 2018-01-24 05:22:47 Love the fact so many Oilers fans and media types are jumping on Sekera for his play. Give your collective heads a shake and be better. So predictable...just as these struggles were.

8534 2018-01-24 05:19:24 Math is simple. State owned oil companies are increasing profit to offset losses in early years when prices were checked. Also government is increasing taxes to recover the subsidies given earlier. This will continue till its brought under GST and makes everyone happy.
8535 2018-01-24 05:19:10 I disagree. If the Penalty Kill was at, say, 70% or 75%, that would be terrible, but I would understand your point. The PK is an NHL recors 53% on home ice. That is definitely most concerning.

8561 2018-01-24 05:14:55 When PC took over Oilers couldn't keep the puck out of the net. Millions of moves later now oilers cant score either.

8569 2018-01-24 05:13:18 Dear @AdnocGroup / @ADNOCdist

I just LOVE when i drive to your station to have the car oil changed, and hear the most beautiful sound to my ears "No filter".
Most of your station doesn't have filters.
MOST.

8571 2018-01-24 05:13:08 If someone carries sanctified meat in the fold of a garment and the fold touches bread, soup, wine, oil, or any other food, do they become sanctified? “No,” the priests answered. Then Haggai asked: “If a person defiled from contact with a corpse touches any of these,
8572 2018-01-24 05:13:07 Unlike you & many other fans, I don't feel this team has mailed it in that often. It's the reality of the situation. There is nothing to condone, .no one enjoys blaming meaningless games. Funny thing is, as bad as the PK is, the fact they can't score is far more concerning
8573 2018-01-24 05:13:06 President beware of your Senate Courts Judges banking Pharma oil cartels FDA are all ANTI US Elements they are the most dangerous elements for not only US society but for the whole humanity. Believe me you are God choice to eliminate this structure and they are biggest hurdels
8574 2018-01-24 05:13:02 to be fair doesn't dt have big interest in oil?
8575 2018-01-24 05:12:48 Anyway someone I admired just tweeted they loved Canola Oil's solo album I just - she should not be as famous as she is, girl cannot sing!

8578 2018-01-24 05:12:40 While I usually enjoy watching your show, I have to tell you, when Richard Goodstein is on, I have to turn it off. I have never seen him answer a direct question, and I have no use for snake oil.
8579 2018-01-24 05:12:36 The answer to that question lies in the race of the shooter and Alaska's resistance to oil drilling

8586 2018-01-24 05:11:06 You do know not one more dollar has been spent on military this year than years passed, right? trump's pro oil and coal stance helps his buddy putin cause russia lives off oil .... ( and there is that little matter of 19% of rostnef to be considered )
8587 2018-01-24 05:11:02 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
8588 2018-01-24 05:11:02 Wow, so justified. Might as well throw your trash to the streets since it's nothing compared to the oil industry, uh?
8589 2018-01-24 05:10:55 That's a great thing.   Off shore drilling is super hard too fix if something goes wrong.   If it's closer too the shore line it's easier too clean up unless you want too go against the oil company and change water into hydrogen by putting electric curent through it... Either or

8591 2018-01-24 05:10:30 Except NM doesn't own the oil

8594 2018-01-24 05:09:45 I think I put too much tea tree oil on my face cause my eyes are starting to burn 
8595 2018-01-24 05:09:40 【News】
A piece of potato with a lot of basil oil danced emotionally on my shirt and pants.
8596 2018-01-24 05:09:36 My LS just offered to come oil my scalp for me. That’s sisterhood 
8597 2018-01-24 05:09:25 There you go again, trying to distract while you shuffle the shells...like all Grifters and Snake Oil Salesmen do! People are on to you now, Donnie. We all know your tricks and tells. Are they next to the tapes you have of the Comey meeting, or the Uranium or Obama tapes? Loser
8598 2018-01-24 05:09:24 All I used was tanning oil 
8599 2018-01-24 05:09:00 Give it Time.  Ex: Venezuela                    Norway will be forced to contend with free market economics or any business they have will flee. It’s being sustained by oil companies there and last time I checked the workers didn’t own the means of Production.
8600 2018-01-24 05:08:48 So under your premise We bought oil from Venezuela, turned it into A Sh*thole, and then they came here!
So its OK to destroy Another country! While you Drive around in your SUV.
8601 2018-01-24 05:08:42 I’m making Leroy should i paint or oil pastel in colors help
8602 2018-01-24 05:08:41 I need a oil change
8603 2018-01-24 05:08:30 I always forget about the applesauce. I do sub yogurt a lot for oil. Wasn’t sure if it would work for butter
8604 2018-01-24 05:08:11 If that happens so be it but if McLellan gets the axe and Chiarelli survives, that is pathetic.
8605 2018-01-24 05:08:01 Duster update: Carb is on just gotta tune it right and then get new tires in and get the original rally wheels cleaned up get those put on then do new brake pads and change the oil then check the spark plugs maybe replace them then we will be good to go
8606 2018-01-24 05:07:51 Idk if you have access to it but CBD oil is great
8607 2018-01-24 05:07:44 A big shame on all the Leaders of our country who keep mum on increasing crimes. Why females r being raped, why Rapists don't hv fear?? Why Strict punishment is not given? All want votes. Put all leaders in one oil well n lit by fire.
8608 2018-01-24 05:07:42 Did y’all know YT ppl be out here making pancakes with just butter in the pan? No oil
8609 2018-01-24 05:07:42 It is about money for trump and all his other mega wealthy friends, billionaires always want more money, the reason he doesn’t care about the salary is because it’s peanuts compared to the oil pay offs he will get. I guarantee he IS taking his salary.
8610 2018-01-24 05:07:31 Who is up burning the midnight oil with the rest of us?#MilitiaInsomniacs
8611 2018-01-24 05:07:16 It’s an angry night in Oil country
8612 2018-01-24 05:07:06 But it will Help out his buddies in the oil industry, because when solar becomes more expensive,oil becomes more appealing...and you can be sure he will get throwbacks from that!
8613 2018-01-24 05:07:01 Akak fikir habis serum nak beli face oil dia. Sebab Keihl’s Vit C serum tu RM299 wei. Semalam tanya pasal set diorang, semua RM711. 
8614 2018-01-24 05:06:57 Minki looks so so good but the oil on his face is a No no
8615 2018-01-24 05:06:47 Super common to see applesauce as an oil substitute and yogurt instead of butter.
8616 2018-01-24 05:06:38 Hoping he gets that gooood wonderbread bag and olive oil treatment.........(look it up)

8620 2018-01-24 05:06:02 They don't need to mail it in, just continue to be who've they've been all season long. What this group accomplishes means little b/c they need to make impactful changes.
8621 2018-01-24 05:06:02 Did my meal prep food shop! Excellent choices even put a new addition into the mix, salmon & coconut oil  & now I’m pumped for the rest of the day/night of cooking, weighing & prepping 
8622 2018-01-24 05:05:56 助成金って、支給されたほうも年度末にガッチガチに用途を組んで、その通りに使わ無いと捕まっちゃうので、難しいのよ
8623 2018-01-24 05:05:47 No, your oil buddies win (hi Russia).
8624 2018-01-24 05:05:38 Agree we need more than one customer so we aren't forced to discount our oil. Foreign companies leaving is recent & for assorted business reasons like in the case of Shell other acquisitions. China is still here.
8625 2018-01-24 05:05:37 @realDonaldTtump you are a disgrace, a BS artist, a fraud. Even your base is finally seeing through this week snake oil you're peddling. Stick your wall, or go try to get the money from Mexico. They'll tell you to stick it too.
8626 2018-01-24 05:05:35 *coconut oil !!!!!!!
8627 2018-01-24 05:05:34 เยอะมากอ่ะ คะแนนดี
8628 2018-01-24 05:05:18 The only viable solution is to free ourselves from the "White's system",simply just walk away,I mean we are the oil to their machine
8629 2018-01-24 05:05:03 Coconut oil & lotion really will have your skin feeling like a baby's
8630 2018-01-24 05:05:00 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?
8631 2018-01-24 05:04:39 More jobs in solar than in oil and coal combined.

Why do we let him lie every day?
8632 2018-01-24 05:04:31 putting too much peppermint oil in my diffuser= my room smelling like the dentist
8633 2018-01-24 05:04:02 im using this new face oil and im praying hard that it doesnt make my skin react badly bc my birthday is in 2 days and im tryna have flawless skin!!!

8636 2018-01-24 05:03:39 Oh no try a hot oil treatment or two
8637 2018-01-24 05:03:18 When your entire cabinet is in bed with oil and gas it makes total sense. Script in development mode now.
8638 2018-01-24 05:03:10 I was aghast. Keep those oil & coal cronies appeased and greased.
8639 2018-01-24 05:02:57 Just got the new Dove For Men all in 1 shampoo/conditioner/body wash/ hand soap/face wash/hair gel/dish soap/ toothpaste/ olive oil/ wiper fluid/lighter fluid/ laundry detergent
8640 2018-01-24 05:02:57 Waiting for an oil change last week, the waiting room was full of optimistic dudes who knew more about crypto currency than their age and economic status would otherwise indicate. Oil change waiting room bros, I hope you can quit that quarry job & @kfc soon.

8644 2018-01-24 05:01:33 Thanks guys, but I really need to know if this is pure olive oil and not one of those unhealty blends?  I read an article that it was, but you peeps seem to know best. Thanks again
8645 2018-01-24 05:01:28 Inspired by @Mededitor to make soup dumplings for supper tonight! Pork + prawns + shiitake + ginger + scallions + cilantro + sesame oil + soy sauce + rice vinegar. Used prawn shells + ginger + watercress to make a lovely broth. 
8646 2018-01-24 05:01:26 He is putting America back in the dark ages. Now he is talking of putting a 30% tariff on solar panels? This will result in the loss of 23,000 jobs. How is this making America great again. He wants to maintain coal and oil for his friend Putin.
8647 2018-01-24 05:01:18 Pssh. I play with only a DDR mat, covered in oil. #MyLevel
8648 2018-01-24 05:01:12 China is doing what it can about #ClimateChange but USA has problems reversing GHG emissions. Trump's extra tariff on solar panels & approval of more oil and coal extraction are going the wrong way

8650 2018-01-24 05:00:59 That's shows your poor knowledge and not accepting the truth  will.tell you dumb . I was not asking you dollar rate. At that time it 130 dollar crude oil and it is 55 dollar crude oil which is higher and lower you ask some one they will explain.

8652 2018-01-24 05:00:18 @GovInslee @CityofTacoma @PortofTacoma @fife_washington 1 gallon of oil contaminates 250,000 gallons of water, 1 gallon of fuel contaminates 750,000 gallons of water!!! We the #People do not want the 8,000,000 gallon fuel storage tank constructed. @PSETalk #Nolng253
8653 2018-01-24 05:00:11 Gets worse! It’s canned tuna (terrible!!), sautéed onions (oil+ vinegar) and mashed potatoes 
8654 2018-01-24 05:00:10 Indonesian entrepreneurs make plastic bag using cassava starch, vegetable oil, and organic resins. The resulting "100% bio-based" material was biodegradable and compostable, breaking down over a period of months on land or at sea, or instantly in hot water.

8671 2018-01-24 04:58:11 Ans first about crude oil then and now. Don't jump or accept the truth. And rates of calling came down to 20ps because of UPA govt . If you go back read the news. JIO  WAS ABLE to come market because of UPA policies
8672 2018-01-24 04:58:11 The principle of this is aggravating as shit. Drumpf is trying to kill clean energy, because he's getting money from oil and coal people. And everything Trump is trying to do related to coal is built on lies. The industry has died for a reason - it's been replaced by better.

8674 2018-01-24 04:57:43 The reason they have beauty contests for camels is because before the United States shit on us with money all the people had were camels, they were literally people of the desert and when the money from the oil started coming in they had to find soemthing to put value to..

8681 2018-01-24 04:56:47 I thought I needed to rush & find somebody to love... but all I needed was some coconut oil 
8682 2018-01-24 04:56:38 I use Crest Pro Whitening with Tarter Protection. If you’re going the organic route activated charcoal paste works well. It’s activated charcoal + coconut oil mixed
8683 2018-01-24 04:56:37 Is this a country club attitude with the oil? Paid millions to win 1 in 3( on average ) suck the fans into paying hundreds to watch this team suck. While they make thousands per shift,if they get one?
8684 2018-01-24 04:56:36 He's creating jobs for the Russians who are exporting oil.  Quid pro quo.
8685 2018-01-24 04:56:31 Because, Rosneft. There’s a whole lotta Russian oil stakes in Trumplandia.

8690 2018-01-24 04:56:02 뭐
8691 2018-01-24 04:56:01 Just watched a Dawn commercial in which people are cleaning up birds covered in oil.  First thought: “I don’t really like birds.”  Fair enough?

8693 2018-01-24 04:55:38 You're just foul for that, FAH-WUHL!!! Jasmine rice is awesome - plain jasmine rice, couple drops of toasted sesame oil, touch of salt & pepper and a big ass bottle of wine. Not bad for a late night snack.

I suggest you start looking at new hairstyles now that don't need a quart of oil. They don't allow all kinds of hair products where you're going.

You like the color orange right?

8700 2018-01-24 04:54:54 Burning that midnight oil, if I cant sleep I might as well right? Also #HarryPotter marathon because yeap!
8701 2018-01-24 04:54:53 Coal and oil. A lot of his rich buddies are in oil, including Putin.
8702 2018-01-24 04:54:43 Coaching needs changes just as badly.
8703 2018-01-24 04:54:39 Really need to get a cast iron pan for my dorm... I don't know how to cook tortillas on stainless steel without burning the oil
8704 2018-01-24 04:54:31 ladder why the floor it was cooking oil
8705 2018-01-24 04:54:09 Trump said take their oil! Very Christ like, like @hobbylobby breaking into nimrod's tomb in Iraq and taking jeruselum from Palestinians.
8706 2018-01-24 04:53:53 Cookie Butter Ice Cream, Frozen chicken or pork Shu Mai, Extra Virgin Olive Oil
8707 2018-01-24 04:53:44 Now that the fish oil capsule craze is over - and shown to be not all that good anyway, can we please go back to having sardines preserved in their own oil?
8708 2018-01-24 04:53:42 WHO??? Big Oil...LoL

8710 2018-01-24 04:53:17 S&P Global Ratings said the Indian economy is shaking off its post-GST implementation woes but risks from higher oil prices have reappeared
8711 2018-01-24 04:53:12 And that is another reason he did it! It made us energy independent. Which gives you upper hand negotiating individual deals!  Can't hang oil over our heads! For first time in history, we export more than we import!
8712 2018-01-24 04:53:04 What happens when you no longer need “regular service visits”? Say, if you have an electric car requiring no oil changes, smog tests, oil filter/gas filter/fan belt/alternator/etc replacements, brake pad replacements, etc? What then?
8713 2018-01-24 04:52:58 they say you are what you eat but it’s funny because i don’t remember eating a legend — Jacob Sartorius, oil on canvas (2018)
8714 2018-01-24 04:52:56 The US economy experienced various "favorable supply shocks" which shift aggregate supply curve to the right. Some factors include declining oil prices, tech advancements & labor market changes. What will be the next "supply shock" to hit the US? Will it be favorable?
8715 2018-01-24 04:52:43 Lead them from temptation, make them royalty
All the things we're facin' makes us question it
Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please
That's how we become kings and queens
8716 2018-01-24 04:52:43 If you was in the oil and gas industry you live a recession + a bear market but lower energy cost was good for most of the other sector and central banker save the market

8721 2018-01-24 04:52:31 I’ve had a small spray bottle of tea tree oil on my dresser next to my perfume. For a few days now I’ve been reminding myself to pick the correct bottle when I go to spray my face. Tonight, I picked the wrong bottle
8722 2018-01-24 04:52:23 Well said.  Trump is against solar, because he is against clean energy and wants coal and oil.  Pisses him off that China has the market on solar panels.
8723 2018-01-24 04:52:17 I love lavender scents and oils so much. Lavender essential oils, lavender scented castor oil etc etc I’m OBSESSED
8724 2018-01-24 04:52:14 ACDC. Jimmy Barnes. INXS. Goanna. John Farnham. Midnight Oil. Cold Chisel. Icehouse. Men At Work. Guy Sebastian. Kylie Minogue. James Flamestar.

Down the rabbithole of Aussie artists for my Aus Day playlist ;D
8725 2018-01-24 04:52:13 Social democracy, at best. That's capitalism with a safety net. With an economy heavily reliant on oil. So when they couldn't rely on oil anymore, their economy crashed.
8726 2018-01-24 04:52:12 Half the things you see online have already been spatchcocked. The spine has been taken out of it and the legs are spread eagle. The head is still in tact and the oil is from the heart. The tears you see are poisoned by repetition and turn on like overheated taps that drip.
8727 2018-01-24 04:52:04 coconut oil???
8728 2018-01-24 04:51:59 freshly shaved legs & body oil was a match made in heaven
8729 2018-01-24 04:51:52 @bighobbyism 1/2 cup of yogurt & 1/2 cup of grape seed oil... perfection. Overkill, maybe?... but I got the moistest muffins in all the land
8730 2018-01-24 04:51:52 Also fish oil (omega 3’s help brain function) 5htp (increases serotonin) and magnesium (can reduce production of stress hormones/help neuron functioning) !!! #holistic #health #happybitches
8731 2018-01-24 04:51:47 I would debate that pouring oil on water would make that water oily and not wet.
8732 2018-01-24 04:51:43 My sister sweaaaar she doing damage in the instead all I smell is coconut oil . Do y’all know how bad that shit smell ?
8733 2018-01-24 04:51:41 萎えたので名前だけでも元気にしてみた
8734 2018-01-24 04:51:30 So what was the rate of crude oil when it was 81 and what is todays rate of crude oil. if you are not dumb then reply
8735 2018-01-24 04:51:27 I beat it right after you offered to help, used the oil and molotov. The One Reborn is currently giving me nightmares
8736 2018-01-24 04:51:23 Oil'n'Rocker
8737 2018-01-24 04:51:13 I agree that Putin hates Clinton more than he likes Trump. Trump is his way to lifted sanctions and an easy path to nuke reactors and oil in the middle east. Trump is a partner, Clinton never would have been
8738 2018-01-24 04:51:09 Pro tip of the night: Rub coconut oil on her booty while she riding you
8739 2018-01-24 04:51:02 He let the silence permeate for a good while, as his hands now worked on stretching the dough on the olive oil coated countertop.

"...Do you have any scars, Hanae?"
8740 2018-01-24 04:50:57 There is a reason why he is no longer on it. Again enough w/ the square peg in a round hole. The year is done & whatever happens from here on out doesn't mean anything. Actually improve the roster in off-season & see what happens.
8741 2018-01-24 04:50:47 tRUmp doing what he can do boost the price of oil for his boss.
8742 2018-01-24 04:50:45 Danny picks a different scent for our humidifier oil diffuser each night. It’s like being at a resort with scent menus.
8743 2018-01-24 04:50:37 you can pour oil in water, it'll settle out, and you can remove it. putting a liquid on something (thus making it wet) and then you can scoop it out after it settles (thus drying it). obviously water in its normal state is not wet
8744 2018-01-24 04:50:23 WELP I'm so late to this one I have no chance but I know my hair likes argan oil so I'm gonna try!!
8745 2018-01-24 04:50:17 Definitely Not!  What kind of heathen do you take me for?

It's 12% pure sugar and 87% partially hydrogenated moss oil.
8746 2018-01-24 04:50:16 Diamond should be cutting off the pass from half wall down low. Fail. Should also pick off pass from down low to front of net. Fail. Had a straight line yet didn't connnect the dots. It's like the Oil hated geometry!
8747 2018-01-24 04:50:14 That's where we send our oil at a 30% discount to world prices.  Why wouldn't they love us?
8748 2018-01-24 04:50:11 I should buy lavender oil, that should help some
8749 2018-01-24 04:50:04 I remember when I had bad skin and @FImanke asked me if I used coconut oil as a moisturizer. Still love her
8750 2018-01-24 04:49:53 You just need a couple of desert spoon of olive oil and vinegar and maybe two tea spoons of da honey
8751 2018-01-24 04:49:43 Met a Vet while getting my oil changed who nearly died from it, got #flushot every year thereafter. Shared with a young man who said he never gets it. #historyteacher
8752 2018-01-24 04:49:42 Snarky like a snake oil salesman
8753 2018-01-24 04:49:40 I believe the solar panel tariff was to protect Trump’s friends want to keep the filthy oil business poisoning America. 
Call for a green America 
Out loud
8754 2018-01-24 04:49:39 I 10/10 recommend essential oil diffusers
8755 2018-01-24 04:49:25 Gcobisa itea trea oil kuma pimples, uvuka zishile ekuseni
8756 2018-01-24 04:49:21 LoL - why do you think he cares?  It's about the oil/coal CEO's - not the workers - never has been.  He promised the moon to get in office, but his actions are solely to benefit the .1%.  This isn't "backfire", this was the plan all along.
8757 2018-01-24 04:49:20 oh!イル
8758 2018-01-24 04:49:17 Luckily, no, you didn’t have to stay to collect. We left after the second period.
8759 2018-01-24 04:49:12 NHKが立ち去るまで外出られない･･･
8760 2018-01-24 04:49:12 Does this happen every game?
8761 2018-01-24 04:49:08 Y’all where can I find some avocado oil or coconut oil for a reasonable price?
8762 2018-01-24 04:49:01 Yet another shameful performance by the Oil...Chiarelli and McLellan have to be held accountable for this mess.
8763 2018-01-24 04:49:01 Got the lavender essential oil mix going (thanks @rissamack) and took two sleep aids. Let’s hope that helps. I desperately need to sleep.
8764 2018-01-24 04:49:00 Am I the only one who runs through oil cartridges to soon lol
8765 2018-01-24 04:49:00 This is why JFK was murdered by the far right; in Dallas the coalition of right wing nuts, big oil men, & evil CIA was created  with posters  of JFK with the word traitor;in wild west justice of Dallas,any traitor could be shot;Oswald was a  patsy,Ruby was told to kill  Oswald
8766 2018-01-24 04:48:40 You shouldn't because you had a facecam many times in 2015
8767 2018-01-24 04:48:37 I have to supply and arm General Goddafi to deal with Syria Oil Situation and General Goddafi Son to deal with Libya Oil situation.
8768 2018-01-24 04:48:11 Essential oil diffusers are just second wave vaping
8769 2018-01-24 04:48:02 McDavid has more than the two combined. Strome has nearly 5 minutes TOI on the PK this yr. I think it's unfair to say he's been "used" on the PK.
8770 2018-01-24 04:47:55 I think we should creat our own energy KPI’s customized for our country.

We have excellent experience in oil refining benchmarking such as SOLOMON Associate

we are pioneers in energy sector to the level where others can benchmark their energy performance with our developd KPI’s
8771 2018-01-24 04:47:53 The Oil lose 5-0 to the Sabres tonight. McLellan on the hot seat yet?
8772 2018-01-24 04:47:33 No problem we will never make fun of you and I mean never
8773 2018-01-24 04:47:28 They can end world hunger. But they don't. 

And just imagine a world where the US didn't invade the middle east for its oil! Their war machine does more harm than good. The civilian death toll is extraordinary. 5% less bombs for them and we could solve world hunger. Imagine that
8774 2018-01-24 04:47:23 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
8775 2018-01-24 04:47:07 this coconut oil makes my lips smell good as fuck
8776 2018-01-24 04:46:12 We do and understand how you feel. Our employees are residents too. The price of oil does affect our bills and integrating renewables comes with a cost but we are always looking for ways to be more cost efficient. We appreciate your feedback. Mahalo.
8777 2018-01-24 04:46:11 Good for you !! With bajra na rotla I hope. With that little excess oil peeking coyly from the edges of the veggies 
8778 2018-01-24 04:46:07 This is state abuse of power. Americans don’t hv to prove  their citizenship! This isn’t a 3rd world country or paranoid oil producing country! Every passenger & the driver should sue for illegal detention. @CustomsBorder @DHSgov  @FLGovScott @SenBillNelson @marcorubio @NPR
8779 2018-01-24 04:46:03 Under Trump, we've had his fans threaten to shoot-up pizza shops and CNN offices. We've had the largest mass-shooting in history. Trump threatens nuclear war with NK weekly. Trump has lifted pollution restrictions, increases oil drilling, and continues to deny climate science.
8780 2018-01-24 04:46:02 Stop being dramatic! You know coconut oil goes in everything
8781 2018-01-24 04:45:58 This lavender oil is putting me right to sleep 
8782 2018-01-24 04:45:45 Witch Hazel and Tea tree oil are two of the greatest things I have ever put on my skin
8783 2018-01-24 04:45:39 yall vitamin e oil has legit changed my life go get you some at kroger for $4
8784 2018-01-24 04:45:34 Olivia and Tiara: talking about hell and how to prevent going. Vanessa: listening in the back seat of the car. Scared of hell, comes home and walks straight to the altar and anoints herself with oil and begins to pray. “I’m not going to hell”
8785 2018-01-24 04:45:33 This is what we do to human beings?  What a disgrace!! Not to mention dumping clean water while they destry ours with oil drilling.  Republicans, they are deplorable!
8786 2018-01-24 04:45:19 Tlhwatlhwa ya leokwane  mo ga Botswana Oil ke go re utswela fela
8787 2018-01-24 04:45:15 I think i have coconut oil in my eye. Fucking DIYs
8788 2018-01-24 04:45:06 I put too much coconut oil on my face and jokingly asked my boyfriend if I looked like a glazed donut, the man said so inncoently, “no I don’t like donuts” 
8789 2018-01-24 04:45:01 Unbelievable we cannot get our Canadian oil to tidewater and the Maritimes is purchasing oil from other countries, some of them pretty shady. Whats wrong with this picture?
8790 2018-01-24 04:45:00 Africa, because we - European empires - fucked it up by bleeding it dry of resources, drawing arbitrary borders, then scuttling out when the natives realised what happened. The ME, for the above and because we keep fucking about with it and blowing it up, mostly for oil.
8791 2018-01-24 04:44:53 最終的にハンコつく人はそうかもしれないけど、都議員レベルじゃ公用車なんか付かないし、雪対策考えるのは区議会レベル。みんなほとんど公共交通機関使ってるよ。要は年に2-3回有るか無いかの事に予算組めないんだよ。組んだら毎年きっちり使い切らなきゃならないから
8792 2018-01-24 04:44:50 Lived in an oil community. Bust before last one people burned their furniture in the street cause they couldn't afford to move it. You'd think a province that left itself totally dependent on foreign resource corps would've figured out the boom bust cycle..
8793 2018-01-24 04:44:23 Only way to eat kale is grilled with olive oil and salt. Raw is bullshit.
8794 2018-01-24 04:44:23 Too bad you probably had to wait till the end of this shit hockey to collect your prize !
8795 2018-01-24 04:44:06 @ChrisStirewalt is difficult to watch...dripping with a putrid oil of self congratulation and constantly offending viewers with his poor thespian act...rolling eyes and smirks.  One needs a shower after watching him.
8796 2018-01-24 04:44:00 Both have been used on the PK
8797 2018-01-24 04:43:50 The oil is such a hardo move
8798 2018-01-24 04:43:46 if I could steal churros without burning my hand in the hot oil and not feeling guilty, I would do it
8799 2018-01-24 04:43:13 "The phoniest and craziest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even cuddled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
8800 2018-01-24 04:43:12 No s**t 
8801 2018-01-24 04:43:06 i cooked the pancetta down first then used the oil to cook the eggs in. Works great with out fatty it is
8802 2018-01-24 04:42:33 I visited Borneo last year and witnessed some of the effects palm production. It was upsetting. But it’s ok for you vegans you can keep using palm oil products and still not alter your moral compass. Your vegan definition says it’s ok.
8803 2018-01-24 04:42:30 The cost of climate mitigation must be borne by those responsible, fossil fuel extractors of all stripes, coal, oil and gas. We cannot allow them to socialize the costs while privatizing the profits. Those days will come to an end as these lawsuits work through the courts.

8805 2018-01-24 04:42:23 i need to change my oil soooo bad
8806 2018-01-24 04:42:19 Who suggested that was the case? Just b/c they are dead last in PK doesn't automatically mean that. Problem is, their confidence is shot & the roster doesn't have any other PK guys on it. You can't make players into something they are not.
8807 2018-01-24 04:42:15 And contribute to an acceleration of climate change. Nothing but bad news for all Americans. Except owners of oil and coal companies.
8808 2018-01-24 04:42:11 Usual Sarah BS and lies. Nothing she says is believable so never listen to her. She is mean, snarky and a disgrace to her position. May not always have liked past presidents, but their press secretaries have been worth listening to. Sarah is a snake oil sales person and obnoxious
8809 2018-01-24 04:42:01 There is nothing which edifies others so much as charity and kindness, by which, as by the oil in our lamp, the flame of good example is...
8810 2018-01-24 04:41:55 ชื่อโจวรุ่ยค่ะะะะะ ตัวจีนเขียนแบบนี้ #周锐 นี่แอบมองๆอยู่เหมือนกัน ยิ้มหวานมากเลย
8811 2018-01-24 04:41:55 This govt wasted a golden opportunity to grow the economy while intl oil prices were low. Its divisive cow belt politics and anti democratic policies means country will take a long time to recover while the poorest suffer #Jumlanomics #Modinomics
8812 2018-01-24 04:41:39 It’s what I said earlier. Most humans prefer the simplicity of blaming one thing. It’s inaccurate, but it’s easier for most people.
8813 2018-01-24 04:41:21 All is a criminal disaster in the WH due to Trump. It's a crime for Trump to destroy Bears Ear & the Grand Staircase, I've only seen it via my computer, it's nature's beauty. To destroy it for oil, gas is a crime, is nothing sacred to Trump?
8814 2018-01-24 04:41:21 Dems & GOPwar
Dems/GOPbailouts
Dems/GOPtrade deals (NAFTA, CAFTA, TPP, etc)
Dems/GOP  chartr schools
Dems/GOP  fracking
Dems/GOP  oil pipelines 
Dems/GOP  spying on Americans 

Dems/GOP are one and the same.
8815 2018-01-24 04:41:03 I'll buy oil based butter substitutes! I'll buy them and enjoy them!
8816 2018-01-24 04:40:52 No. Two easy common sense ways to think about that.

Just look at it relative to Euro or other currencies and you can see it rose and fell. 

Second, oil is up over 200% since 2016 lows. Dollar obviously did not move that much.
8817 2018-01-24 04:40:48 Yep. I recommend natural, oil-based products--which, I know, sounds incredibly contradictory. By removing excess oil w/lukewarm water, bathing w/gentle soaps, & using a natural moisturizer, your skin should, ideally, balance out. Oil is good--just not too much of it at once. 
8818 2018-01-24 04:40:44 I used too much coconut oil. I should let y’all see how shiny I am right now.
8819 2018-01-24 04:40:31 you are not going to convince BLH about PC.
8820 2018-01-24 04:40:29 i have black watercolor and oil paint but i’m not off of work until 10 /:
8821 2018-01-24 04:40:25 Did you get any “olive oil” while you were there?!?!
8822 2018-01-24 04:40:20 There is something so comforting about a slice of pita bread, zaatar, olive oil, and a slice of tomato #Yalla 
8823 2018-01-24 04:40:19 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
8824 2018-01-24 04:40:16 I mean - he might mean the fact that the Gulf Stream could mean oil spilled in the Gulf could wrap around FL and wash up at Mar-A-Lago. He is trying to not admit that Trump’s business could benefit. 

But that is already a threat with the current drilling in TX/LA.
8825 2018-01-24 04:39:57 Can you start talking about the Eskimos on the drive home show ? There is nothing more to discuss when it comes to the Oil.
8826 2018-01-24 04:39:42 Wait, so you're holding OUR tax dollars (not Mexico's) hostage so you can build your pointless wall that most of us don't want? After blatantly giving your big oil buddies a gift? Treasonous piece of shit.
8827 2018-01-24 04:39:40 That's ok. Coal and oil are back on. So it's all good.
8828 2018-01-24 04:39:32 He really likes Pacifica in “Island Vanilla” on me. Other than that I always smell like coconut oil. Perfume I gotta got with Clean “Warm Cotton”
8829 2018-01-24 04:39:08 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
8830 2018-01-24 04:38:58 Yeah I don’t think it shoulda been that much and usually with your first oil change it’s cheaper too depending on where you go
8831 2018-01-24 04:38:53 well when the players don't show up consistently, the small potatoes turn into a big ol' batch of mashed potatoes.
8832 2018-01-24 04:38:51 Stay positive Oil Country, Oilers are the only team to beat Vegas TWICE this year....
8833 2018-01-24 04:38:46 Raiders like gun oil, tickets, blind one head and aluminum
8834 2018-01-24 04:38:28 But you know what’s really fun?

Getting eucalyptus essential oil in your eye.

10/10 would recommend.
8835 2018-01-24 04:38:26 Didn't say it was but when some suggest the coach should use different players on the PK, please tell me who they are? Poorly constructed roster and players w/ zero confidence is a deadly combination.
8836 2018-01-24 04:38:24 The team has the second best road PK. No idea who is mostly to blame. It’s a collective stink.

8840 2018-01-24 04:38:12 Yes mr Akin,im sure your friends at the CPC and rebel news have been been burning the midnight oil to assist the libs in this agreement,i know globalmedia has really tried tearing it apart.

8852 2018-01-24 04:36:37 I think we should creat our own KPI’s . 

Also, we need to develop detailed KPI’s under the major KPI’s (where the major kpi’s can be understood by every one and details one must govern the performance) 

SOLOMON Associate for oil refining is a good example for what I mean
8853 2018-01-24 04:36:02 I have to get an oil change and go to the dentist tomorrow. #kms

8856 2018-01-24 04:35:46 Does the removal of safety regulations in the oil & gas industry also give you an opportunity to buy smaller companies and get their oil & gas leases on land after their companies have a major accident?

答え.(C)
8860 2018-01-24 04:35:06 Would make sense though as prior industrial production weakness reflected direct consumer weakness, but this was in large part oil, or supply driven, in fact strong dollar and low oil both fueled consumer strength

8870 2018-01-24 04:34:42 The dollar is at a critical technical level, if it falls I see oil going up, if not, oil is going back to 50, i think the latter is more likely given that the long dollar / long oil trade is very lobsided.
8871 2018-01-24 04:34:34 I tried to fry some chicken and burning hot oil popped in my nose

8888 2018-01-24 04:32:56 By removing safety regulations in the oil and gas industry you are responsible for the increase in accidents that will occur that you will profit from buy owning stock in Halliburton who is called to put out fires and clean up after accidents.

8900 2018-01-24 04:31:40 I understand, you think it’s all on the GM. It’s not. The GM does not make independent coaching decisions. The GM does not make players quit on coaches. Etc.., etc...
8901 2018-01-24 04:31:38 Some of y’alls mentality don’t match the lifestyle you want! I see a lot of “I want a g wagon and Rolls” but you complain about your current 40 dollar oil change!  Baby your tires are going to be 1200 or more dollars let not get into your service fee
8902 2018-01-24 04:31:31 Why are you glistening? Did you like oil up for this pic
8903 2018-01-24 04:31:25 With a 53% pk percentage at home how can you blame that on the gm at this point, not defending chia but at the same time the proof is in the pudding, he’s the head coach. Much better coaches have been fired for a lot less.

8914 2018-01-24 04:30:05 States like the US? Stopping oil flow from Norway would increase the value of oil everywhere. Not just Russia and Venezuela. Besides Norway will easily be above the 2% of GDP target on defense spending set by NATO prior to its 2024 implementation of that target.
8915 2018-01-24 04:29:55 You do realize that the big oil co's Chevron, Aera, Exxon etc PAY MILLIONS in State Taxes and to LOCAL Communities with 1000's of JOBS in California?
 I thought that Liberals were FOR Taxes?

8923 2018-01-24 04:29:07 The current administration has sought to increase domestic oil and gas production. Our largest source for foreign oil is Canada.
I'm no fan of tariffs, but with way off scale subsidies of a power source that only provides power for less than half a day, I'll shed no tears.
8924 2018-01-24 04:28:58 Big oil!
8925 2018-01-24 04:28:57 If Iran gets sanctioned, #oil will skyrocket. Oil is already high. But this will cause oil to reach the price needed for Texas to start producing. So should we buy Great Basin Stocks? $ACGX $GBSN $UWT $DWT #crudeoil #etf $CEGX $NTFL $RCGR @Papa_Stocks @realsheepwolf

8949 2018-01-24 04:26:36 The idiot move of putting a tariff on solar panels is predicted to lose Americana 23,000 jobs. Coal miners aren't getting their jobs back like you promised which leaves just oil as the energy source your pushing. Really stupid of you.
8950 2018-01-24 04:26:34 Soon they will add the very last Oz Toyota to the collection so in terms of economy we'll have no difference from oil sheikhdoms.
8951 2018-01-24 04:26:29 Are you read enough of my tweets to know that I think he's totally insane. But when he isolates it to solar panels it's clear he's trying to protect coal and oil. Nothing about that is good for the people.
8952 2018-01-24 04:26:11 Now if we could have got Alton Gillespie to hand letter it like he did on the Old Milwaukee car in 1983 as Phil Robertson would say, "Now you're cooking with peanut oil."  Lol

8959 2018-01-24 04:25:34 Schools and many other public building are solar powered here in CA. They have panels in the parking lots. This is where Monet should be going. Clean energy, but rather than promote it, he discouraged it by imposing a tariff, but encourages coal, oil, and gas!

8972 2018-01-24 04:24:27 @JustinTrudeau ...how can you sleep at night ?? Did you not listen to Frank McKenna’s interview on BNN today? Selling our resource at reduced prices and importing oil for World prices. You my friend have to grow some and tell the provinces that pipelines will be built. NOW!!
8973 2018-01-24 04:24:27 Russia is a one product country. Oil. Saudi Arabia also.
8974 2018-01-24 04:24:20 Shale players can't control the price of oil for that to be true. China cannot fund anything indefinitely the whole economy is a bubble right now. And even if they could who cares? We get to pocket the price diff and save and invest
8975 2018-01-24 04:24:18 And isn't this the plan? To kill solar and promote oil, gas and coal? He's such a shallow human being and completely driven by $$$. #solartariff is just wrong. Seems one would want to subsidize US Solar panel manufacturing BEFORE worrying about a tariff on imports. #TrumpDontCare

8985 2018-01-24 04:23:51 Today I learned that my car will not spontaneously combust from not changing my oil. Thanks Dad.
8986 2018-01-24 04:23:41 jojoba , like the oil.
8987 2018-01-24 04:23:39 3日経ってるなら大丈夫だと思うけどなぁ…。絶対とは言えないけど。
心配なら受診もありだが、わたしならそのカネで飯食って寝る…かな。
8988 2018-01-24 04:23:25 Dude have you never had olive oil and vinegar?
8989 2018-01-24 04:23:15 Yes, I usually apply it on its own. And if my skin is very dry, I apply coconut oil then body lotion. On my hair, I mix it with other oils and apply it on my scalp and hair at night
8990 2018-01-24 04:23:15 I want to go to Raleigh tomorrow but my car needs an oil change and I don't wanna waste miles LOL
8991 2018-01-24 04:23:10 Said it repeatedly, there is plenty of blame to go around but a mess like this is on the GM. He built this & now has no easy way to fix it.

8994 2018-01-24 04:22:57 And where's the importance of public transport gone? Or does it exist only in oil conservation and pollution control campaigns?
8995 2018-01-24 04:22:56 I’ve now given away two sets of tickets to younger Oil fans who don’t get to go often... 0-4 loss to Nash & whatever the fuck this ends up. Glad they learn young & first hand what it’s like to be a fan of this team.
8996 2018-01-24 04:22:52 やめなさい
8997 2018-01-24 04:22:44 Guys, anong magandang foundation ang pwdeng gamitin? Yung kahit mag oil na una mukha mo at pagpawisan ka na ng kabog, hindi pa din huhulas.
8998 2018-01-24 04:22:38 As many things that went right for the Oil last year went wrong this year. Light = dark. Things will be better next year.
8999 2018-01-24 04:22:18 @all_of_oil LMAO
9000 2018-01-24 04:22:10 Def needs to be precooked! I simmer it in chicken stock then drain, the sautee it with garlic and oil and it's super yummy! Drives me nuts when places cook it wrong and ruin a food experience for people! Then after eating it at the wrong place people think it's gross 
9001 2018-01-24 04:22:09 Trump's mad at Zinke for taking FL off.. the off shore drilling list/So Trump had FL put back on the list/Not forget the list because all the States are pissed/Put FL back on the list/They don't think right/Like a piston is broken in their brains & oil drips from their mufflers
9002 2018-01-24 04:22:08 you can practice the robot all you want, but if you can't get loose you'll never be a good robot. you have to oil your hinges

9008 2018-01-24 04:21:15 Who? As I said earlier, is McDavid supposed to play 40 mins a night? They tried Strome on the PK & he's awful. Maroon & Lucic are to slow. They're trying Khaira but he's a kid & Kassian was never great at it. Again, Who?
9009 2018-01-24 04:21:13 Canada has the LARGEST proven oil reserves in the world. Bigger than Saudi Arabia. Bigger than Kuwait.

Given this enviable position, ANY other country’s government  would RUSH to facilitate the construction of infrastructure needed to bring this oil to tide waters.

9014 2018-01-24 04:20:32 my hair is in need of an oil & a protein treatment & I can finally do it this week 
9015 2018-01-24 04:20:19 Because Rosnef has a lot of oil to send to market.
9016 2018-01-24 04:20:06 Of course, because he wants you to rely on coal, gas, and oil.....and screw the environment.
9017 2018-01-24 04:19:59 Shutting down to save fuel?? Why, When I have oil over h***of lands
9018 2018-01-24 04:19:54 7....and that's the reason why the EU has passed the draft measures to ban the use of palm oil in biofuel in 2021 in the first place. And if that's not the crux of the problem, I don't know what is.
9019 2018-01-24 04:19:51 A shot of VCO/MCT Oil makes a whole lot of difference in terms of digestion and satiety.

A short thread on  Bab el-Mandeb Strait. 

The Bab el-Mandeb (Bab al-Mandab)Strait is a critical maritime passage.  It’s channel is a critical part of global energy security due to the high volume of oil (and other goods) trading through it.

9032 2018-01-24 04:18:30 Sorry for joining wkwk, but I agree! Europeans are well known for using “environmental issues” as a political tool. Like last year’s European Resolution regarding palm oil and deforestation was criticized because it was pretty discriminatory and the background wsn’t 100% accurate
9033 2018-01-24 04:18:25 Because tRump has investments in oil!!!

9037 2018-01-24 04:17:59 There's no agenda. At no point did I say McLellan doesn't share in the blame & my issue w/ Chiarelli started w/ the Hall deal. My point is, if you're trying to hang the coach, you better first look at what he was given to work with. That simple.
9038 2018-01-24 04:17:26 6...Europe's heavy dependence on Russian gas. It simply does not happen. Back to the topic here, inequality is indeed maintained for eternity as nobody likes competition. That's why the EU doesn't seem to wish to solely rely on our palm oil to produce biofuel ....
9039 2018-01-24 04:17:26 Many people pray for cake, but when God gives them eggs, oil, butter, flour, a baking tray and an oven they get furstrated and leave the kitchen. Moral of the story - stay in the kitchen  - Beverly Angel
9040 2018-01-24 04:17:17 You tell me. Their economy was based solely on oil, so it was pretty frail, and 70% of their industry was privatized.

Does "privatized industry" sound like socialism?
9041 2018-01-24 04:17:10 I rarely do pot these days but yeah, I haven't seen or heard of hash or oil since the 90s. Probably because hydro is generally more potent than hash.
9042 2018-01-24 04:17:06 I’m just saying. Some Jamaican castor oil or brow pencil or something. Anything.
9043 2018-01-24 04:16:54 Actually I  want a turkey, lettuce and cheese sub wit salt and pepper and some oil

9068 2018-01-24 04:14:53 Hasn't @potus got a lot of investment in the oil companies?  It makes no sense using fossil fuels when you have the incredible energy of the sun. Just my opinion though.

9091 2018-01-24 04:12:09 Awww it’s okay if you do! Your better off doing it and having healthy hair and after that hair cut just try to do every 2 or 3 month trims + there’s always Castro oil

9102 2018-01-24 04:11:03 Also anyone who credits their glowing skin to tea tree oil, lemon juice, and water 10000% has naturally good skin and should thank their genetics and not tell people on Twitter what to do for their own skincare routine lol
9103 2018-01-24 04:11:01 Many prayers to the men and women in the oil field right now.
9104 2018-01-24 04:10:59 When you get your money from coal and oil companies, you quickly are anti anything that is not coal or oil
9105 2018-01-24 04:10:58 Oil, health insurance, guns, banks, there’s no evil you won’t sell us out to for some sweet campaign cash and a lobbying gig down the line.
9106 2018-01-24 04:10:53 They will eventually, it's a good investment. Costs less than welfare going to illegal aliens now. Currently Mexico receives almost as much money from north of the border as their oil revenues. If you owned a shop, would you lock the doors when you leave?

9110 2018-01-24 04:10:32 He warmed up with NAFTA. Remember when he went on TV and sold us that snake oil?  And then Ross Perot said the thing about the giant sucking sound of jobs going south and everybody laughed at him and voted Clinton/Gore.

I’m hoping just taking out this fucking oil will help but I’ll explain irl what happened I’m so fucking mad
9116 2018-01-24 04:09:46 So today’s fact of the day:

The bar I’m in, literally right in Oil country just unanimously agreed to switch the TV to the @GoldenKnights game instead of the @EdmontonOilers great work guys 
9117 2018-01-24 04:09:46 Are you allergic to coconut?! My friend is and could never figure out why popcorn hurt her stomach! They use coconut oil often!
9118 2018-01-24 04:09:44 I wanted to go as zero waste as possible. I just mix in a jar, coconut oil, honey and baking soda. My face is v oily w/ dry areas, and red spots. Tea tree oil for toner
9119 2018-01-24 04:09:00 It is effort but you have to have a clue. The only F with extended PK on his resume is Letestu and RNH is close...that's it. Not everyone can do it.
9120 2018-01-24 04:08:59 Brought me into my oil self.
9121 2018-01-24 04:08:53 Petrol, diesel prices jump; oil ministry seeks excise duty cuts.
9122 2018-01-24 04:08:43 Mossul = Ninive !!!  Same Place ... The Golan , The Highways ,The Oil & Commodities ...Aaaaand ...  "" The WarLords "".Ad Aeternum...Cattone,isn' it???
9123 2018-01-24 04:08:30 I wish val was here so we can too face mask & coconut oil in our hair and, bump slow jams
9124 2018-01-24 04:08:27 Same players as last year ...
9125 2018-01-24 04:08:23 Bought myself some beard oil. I’m ready to embrace the Papi life 
9126 2018-01-24 04:08:10 This hot oil treatment is everything only black girls understand 
9127 2018-01-24 04:07:46 Coach is the problem.  This team has quit.  Conner is almost nonexistent.
9128 2018-01-24 04:07:40 The players have not showed up again tonight. Poor coaching decisions again tonight. It’s a potato in a bag of potatoes.
9129 2018-01-24 04:07:36 CBC is so happy of sinking of Iranian oil tanker as if it is the wedding of CBC mother!
9130 2018-01-24 04:07:27 Chiarelli trades McDavid for OEL straight up. Defends trade by Oil saving significant $ on the contract and it's the price you have to pay for good D.,
9131 2018-01-24 04:07:04 This is about the 6th time the Oil have been shit pumped by a team that has no business shit pumping them
9132 2018-01-24 04:06:56 The problem is, trying to accomplish No. 3 is rather difficult thanks to the handy work of the GM.
9133 2018-01-24 04:06:50 Yes, I follow big oil companies in my free time. Business isn't doing so well recently.
9134 2018-01-24 04:06:42 When sheep are injured, the Shepherd takes them in the security, puts oil on them, and puts Himself between the danger and the sheep.
9135 2018-01-24 04:06:24 Which was the “political stunt”? Opening offshore areas to drilling when the U.S. is already on target to become the world’s largest oil producer, thanks to shale oil? Or exempting Florida? No matter, either way it’s pretty fucking stupid.
9136 2018-01-24 04:06:22 snake oil an hate .  Same ol bs.
9137 2018-01-24 04:06:08 @ealight461 
Does ANYONE REALLY THINK THEY belong on our coastlines! dt chgd the law big Oil not responsible to clean oil spills!
9138 2018-01-24 04:06:05 argan oil, coconut oil, keratin, and a lot of tlc
9139 2018-01-24 04:05:49 Come on man.  19 NHL skaters and the PK is this bad?   PK is effort and scheme.  Nothing more.  They don’t play hard for him anymore

9142 2018-01-24 04:05:17 Coconut oil is overrated too.
9143 2018-01-24 04:05:16 Use a cotton t shirt or something gentler than a towel and try a light oil serum or a little argan oil - work it through towel dried hair but don’t comb or brush wet hair. Wait until it’s almost try or use a wide tooth comb. This might help smooth out your hair with needing heat
9144 2018-01-24 04:05:11 believing & leaving it to coconut oil to fix my damaged damaged hair. 
9145 2018-01-24 04:04:27 People always want to blame one thing. Everything that happens is a result of multiple factors. Chiarelli is part of a team that is making collaborative decisions. Management, the coaches and players are all at fault. Changes are required to all three.
9146 2018-01-24 04:04:23 putting hot oil in ramen was the best decision I made
9147 2018-01-24 04:04:21 My baby has an ear infection so medicine and the oil diffuser tonight
9148 2018-01-24 04:04:01 Which is what the Junta is giving right now. Lets see. So far signs have been far from encouraging if we think out of our stock mkt bubble. GDP growth has been the lowest in past 30yrs, despite us getting an oil windfall in the prev 3yrs and low commodity prices
9149 2018-01-24 04:03:51 So many of us knew it. He is and always has been a snake oil salesman. Amazing that people still don't see what is right in front of their faces
9150 2018-01-24 04:03:49 First night of castor oil on brows.. crossing my fingers to see progress overtime!! :~)
9151 2018-01-24 04:03:40 That's because he and Ryan are getting major bucks from Big Coal and Big Oil.
9152 2018-01-24 04:03:25 @JeffBezos is worth roughly $100m and is considered the richest man in the world. John D. Rockefeller, the guy that commanded over America's oil industry for years in the early 1900s is worth $340m in 2018 money. Let that sink in.

9157 2018-01-24 04:02:49 Again, like every coach there are things McLellan does that drive people nuts, see Babcock in TO, but he quite literally has no options when it comes to the PK.
9158 2018-01-24 04:02:48 Heading to the 3rd. Oil Barons up 2-1. Pontiacs down to just 15 skaters including 3 APs.
9159 2018-01-24 04:02:41 Jesse and Klefbom for Stone and Lazar. Bring the Oil King home!
9160 2018-01-24 04:02:40 Oilers should be extremely thankful for the Arizona Coyotes. Without them the Oil would undoubtedly be the worst NHL organization. Now it is contested.
9161 2018-01-24 04:02:35 My dad is so random. I was telling him how I’m gonna train at the new gym and out of nowhere he’s asking if my car needs an oil change lmao

9163 2018-01-24 04:02:27 the oil & gas industry, even, that #ClimateBarbie despises, has been teleconferencing bigtime the past 4 years - hardly any travel anymore, even regional flights between Calgary and Fort McMurray

Hey @cathmckenna ‘Big Oil’ walks the talk

When will YOU?
9164 2018-01-24 04:02:24 Tea tree oil is my ride or die for sure
9165 2018-01-24 04:02:22 Gotta get that oil on it every time @FBMscort

9167 2018-01-24 04:02:19 I'm glad I started using hair grease on my scalp again, my hair is too thick to only use oil
9168 2018-01-24 04:02:10 Just got schooled on tea tree oil, coconut oil and charcoal masks.
9169 2018-01-24 04:01:54 Or the flames are just slightly better than the oil

9190 2018-01-24 03:59:18 I think it means we take care of our flesh being the temple of God, while focusing on the spiritual. Our flesh was made corruptible so eventually we age & die in this world. In the kingdom, we will be given glorified bodies as Christ’s. We all need to have our ‘lamp oil’ ready.
9191 2018-01-24 03:59:06 2....palm oil in biofuels in 2021 (that's of course just around the corner), as today's editorial has eloquently put it, which is clearly the tip of the iceberg of what's soon looming large in the same European parliament building should they really decide to officially...

9193 2018-01-24 03:58:38 My mom gets mad when I ask her for measurements. A bit of oil, a pinch of salt, some tomatoes. what does that mean!?!?!?
9194 2018-01-24 03:58:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

9196 2018-01-24 03:58:15 @VinnieTortorich hey Vinnie do you have a recommendation for a good quality brand of olive oil?
9197 2018-01-24 03:57:53 How convenient.  The sleaze here is like an oil slick.
9198 2018-01-24 03:57:46 I'm watching basketball highlights...

9201 2018-01-24 03:57:33 An imperative factor of economic growth is production, without the commanding heights of industrialization and manufacturing economic growth is underpinned with LUCK. Unless you have the luck of oil or the US Dollar, an impossibility.

9204 2018-01-24 03:57:21 Idk if the peppermint oil actually gets rid of headaches or if the tingly/icy sensation just distracts you from thinking you have a headache anymore. Either way, it works.
9205 2018-01-24 03:57:20 Bathing in this organic oil got me soft af already 
9206 2018-01-24 03:57:20 There are also 50k coal miner jobs that are useless compared to solar jobs that are 2x more than coal & oil jobs combined. Stop using numbers.. you're not good at them.

9220 2018-01-24 03:56:04 What could happen: Feds increase interest rates, which reduces consumer demand and thus causes oil price to fall. Higher interest rates also means more expensive car loans, truck loans, and loans for grid storage and solar panels. So an interest rate hike could be pretty bad.

9241 2018-01-24 03:53:42 Not that easy my man, not everyone is cut out to do it. Like you I always had time for Lander but many didn't but maybe don't pay Pouliot to go play for an organization when you have no plan of replacing him. A regular theme...see Hall and Eberle.

9258 2018-01-24 03:51:29 Strip away the annoyance about DARKEST HOUR’s aggressive Great Man middlebrow-ness, and Gary Oldman really is remarkable. The Parliament scenes are lit like an oil painting. The film itself will be forgotten in six months.
9259 2018-01-24 03:51:26 One step closer to letting oil monopolize the energy industry
9260 2018-01-24 03:51:22 So if we say that Tesla is buoyed by the strong economy right now & would do even better in the case of an oil shock (due to huge cost advantage of EVs), then Tesla's only big macroeconomic risk right now is some kind of recession that would occur WITHOUT a prolonged oil shock.

9264 2018-01-24 03:51:08 I guess it makes sense, because it’s just eggs and oil, but that definitely sounds nasty.
9265 2018-01-24 03:51:03 kalo yang alami aku saranin rosehip seed oil, mamaku lagi rutin make dan lumayan keliatan sih perbedaannya
9266 2018-01-24 03:50:59 Yeah my app lied to me and gave the Oil too much credit. Lol.
9267 2018-01-24 03:50:53 To all my brothers who have been blessed with a beard, oil and condition it regularly. It will look and feel so much more elegant!

9270 2018-01-24 03:50:12 DLできんの
9271 2018-01-24 03:50:01 The CBD oil that was being talked about earlier has no psychoactive properties. Other brands shouldn't either, but...
9272 2018-01-24 03:49:32 I’ve been using coconut oil instead of regular moisturizing lotion and baby.... my skin honey! Golden!
9273 2018-01-24 03:49:27 予約しておる
9274 2018-01-24 03:49:23 Maybe there's just a whole lot of people no longer interested/watching/tweeting

9276 2018-01-24 03:49:15 @blakeshelton kinda a long shot but from family of 1 of 5 lost in Patterson  rig 219 in Quinton, Ok think it would be so neat if there was a way one could make a short song of oil rigging and the ones lost. If possible at all and could be used at funeral or slide shows!!!
9277 2018-01-24 03:49:10 神ゲーだぞ？やろう
9278 2018-01-24 03:48:51 I feel like the veil has been torn and I need to grab some oil and go exorcise the demons that made it across the threshold of fort mill. #TooMuchAnimeLately #DontMindMe
9279 2018-01-24 03:48:51 Train some. Don't send Pak to minors. Choose Lander over Letestu.
9280 2018-01-24 03:48:43 Currently Russia and China want to take that power away from the US and allow Yuans to be accepted as China's demand for oil will surpass all other countries.  Ask Saddam Hussein what happened when he started taking Euros for his oil.
9281 2018-01-24 03:48:37 Once I change the oil and rotate the tires on my bicycle I'll be good to scoop 
9282 2018-01-24 03:48:30 @mhenrylaw1 @Carr2485 White Chili: 
2 T oil
1 lg onion, chopped 
4 oz can chopped green chilis
1 t each garlic powder, oregano, cumin & coriander 
1/4 t cayenne pepper 
4 cans great northern beans
14.5 oz can chunked chicken, drained 
About 10 oz chicken stock 
1 can corn
9283 2018-01-24 03:48:18 today’s goal is to not sleep all day again and read instead also oil ya damn hair it needs nourishment in this dry ass winter
9284 2018-01-24 03:48:17 Coconut oil on your legs is one of the best feelings in the world

9286 2018-01-24 03:47:59 We have plenty of time to transition. We also have plenty of oil and gas to take time and transition correctly.  Your scare tactics will not work ever again. Church of climatology has died. You lifetime politician's are done. Term limits and no lobbyist for gov employees
9287 2018-01-24 03:47:53 I think I'm partial to the whale oil jet powered cart myself
9288 2018-01-24 03:47:51 @JChurchRadio #f2b #f2bq  Has Dr. Orloff ever used Vetiver Oil to 'ground' herself? This really helps me when I feel I'm being overwhelmed.
9289 2018-01-24 03:47:49 Lucas Oil Stadium is ten years old, and this year, for the SIXTH time, it was named the best stadium in the NFL. To me this is no surprise! I have not seen the @Colts play there, but my H.S. football team played in state in '09 and '10 in there and I took the tour... BEAUTIFUL!
9290 2018-01-24 03:47:42 Most I really was gonna give her as a solid 50 Years on her life you know because coconut oil and shit nd maybe she stays drinking bottles of water every day but I see she’s now a fucking wizard or something cuz how else you explain this shit
9291 2018-01-24 03:47:39 Bullish long-term chart patterns on key commodity-related ETFs suggest that a major uptrend is just getting started. #BeEarly #ContrarianValue #Energy #Oil #NaturalGas $pea.v $qec.to $ati.v $ppr.to $pcq.v $jnx.v @JMaserati @MAViscosi @mrbinnion @beaud113

9293 2018-01-24 03:47:16 He’s terrible on the ice no matter PP, PK or evens
9294 2018-01-24 03:47:07 All this time i thought moonrocks was an actual strain when really it’s just weed dipped in hash oil & kief 
9295 2018-01-24 03:46:53 good. better them than big oil and war suppliers.
9296 2018-01-24 03:46:36 Honestly man, what is he supposed to do? McDavid can't play 40 mins a night. They have no penalty killers on this team.
9297 2018-01-24 03:46:36 Coconut oil + almond oil hair mask!! 
9298 2018-01-24 03:46:34 @Stephen_Kellogg wondering what to expect from your show at Lucas Oil Estate this Saturday? Full band, solo etc?
9299 2018-01-24 03:46:33 I just log in to twitter with a bottle of baby oil ready at all times. I don't even fight his posts anymore. I'm Tina to his Ike
9300 2018-01-24 03:46:28 also shout out to the cop who saw me walking down walnut street with a can of budweiser, and he did nothing but smile at me.

9303 2018-01-24 03:46:06 They say that when people still rode on vehicles powered by oil, they could go anywhere they wanted. ― Yoshiyuki Sadamoto
9304 2018-01-24 03:46:01 nice my Twitter is now working .. .. Hemp seed oil, Grape seed oil..often in use in our house hold..#f2b
9305 2018-01-24 03:45:57 i just saw The Post and spent the last 30 minutes crying because I was so emotional about my love for newspapers and strong women.
9306 2018-01-24 03:45:53 Your fish doesn't stink putting out oil vape? Take another breath of invisible car vape & go tell patients what you think. #GrowYourOwnTherapy #ACMPR #StopTheStigma #BellLetsTalk
9307 2018-01-24 03:45:49 Durbin looks like the clown found in all velvet oil paintings.
9308 2018-01-24 03:45:27 I would say the keystone is the dollar being the global reserve currency.  It gives the US power over all other countries as their purchases of oil must be made in dollars creating  demand for it and allows the FED to print endless trillions without destabilizing the currency.
9309 2018-01-24 03:45:24 Woo send me a link! Did you get the oil diffuser as well? I want to get one next month with the oils
9310 2018-01-24 03:45:22 Burning the midnight oil
#neversleep
9311 2018-01-24 03:44:41 Crude Oil is really becoming a threat now. It can reduce govt expenditure power. Can widen current account deficit. Inflation.
9312 2018-01-24 03:44:20 Perfect example of gratuitous Lady on Lady 16th C. Oil 
9313 2018-01-24 03:44:14 Plus "threaten the US" is a catch all for:
- You have oil, but you're brown/non-Euro/non-Christian
- You're not down with Capitalism/USD-Hegemony
- You're Socialist/Communist
- You have Nukes, and only we and the people like can have nukes. We Don't Like U
9314 2018-01-24 03:44:03 Oil Billionaires....... Like Obama the Muslim and his Saudi oil friends...... Saudis held oil prices down for Obama..... Yeah those oil tycoons.
9315 2018-01-24 03:43:47 The Oil look unfixable
9316 2018-01-24 03:43:42 Let’s get over ourselves here. Dirty energy has invested heavily in more than a few Democrats as well. Obama took an “all of the above” approach, and he did diddly squat to substantively address the corporate welfare the federal govt lavishes on oil & gas.
9317 2018-01-24 03:43:34 Tonight in pampering: clay mask, glycolic peel, and argan oil in my hair.
9318 2018-01-24 03:43:28 I was about to ask you if it’s worked for you?? It helped me with making them thicker but not longer. & I haven’t used makeup remover in years I only ever use vitamin e oil to remove my makeup and coconut oil to remove mascara that’s why I’m like wtttttfffff lol
9319 2018-01-24 03:43:20 The solar industry employs more people than the oil and gas industry #solar #ActOnClimate
9320 2018-01-24 03:43:10 love these! i have a carton in my fridge right now. i used to eat them w/ cold sesame oil jellyfish.
9321 2018-01-24 03:43:08 Saw sign saying this years ago while visiting an oil drilling rig in Wyoming: "Safety first. Please don't spit on the floor."
9322 2018-01-24 03:43:08 i would eat it with a big fuckin spoonful of coconut oil and pass the fuck out.
9323 2018-01-24 03:43:00 Just what I was told for part and labor. Not including the camshaft sensor, valve cover gasket, timing belt, tune up, oil change  etc etc.
9324 2018-01-24 03:42:59 What do you mean man...this roster was a disaster when he got here Absolutley ridiculous
9325 2018-01-24 03:42:55 Sorry Oil fans but signing Lucic had to have been one of the worst moves in the history of Oilers.
9326 2018-01-24 03:42:49 But the "super-duper "US Shale oil boom" PROPAGANDA will now be desperately used to hold the house of cards for a bit longer.
9327 2018-01-24 03:42:42 We DON'T want or need Russia's oil!!! Additionally, given DJT THINKS he's going to drill off the West coast he needs a plexiglass plate in his stomach to see where he's going!!! NOT going to happen. Period. 
9328 2018-01-24 03:42:37 Eucalyptus definitely but you would have to mix it with a carrier oil like olive, grapeseed, jojoba... the oil itself is too potent
9329 2018-01-24 03:42:03 I’m gonna need more lavender oil. #DukevsWake
9330 2018-01-24 03:41:51 Agreed! Done and done. Don’t worry, got the crock pot from Goodwill.  I’m going to plug it in and tuck an oil soaked rag underneath before I go to bed.
9331 2018-01-24 03:41:46 Hey the jets r playing.    Hey.  18seconds.  Winning 1-0  bye bye oil
9332 2018-01-24 03:41:30 Perhaps an assistant coach or two...we will see.
9333 2018-01-24 03:41:22 I limited Allison’s nap, and I put lavender oil in her bath. Let’s hope she doesn’t wake up at 5 am ready to play 
9334 2018-01-24 03:41:10 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
9335 2018-01-24 03:40:47 Yummy .. roast it , make garlic olive oil, make medicine
9336 2018-01-24 03:40:41 Hahaha a bit dirty... but not as dirty as a giant ball of oil!
9337 2018-01-24 03:40:41 Nope
9338 2018-01-24 03:40:33 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
9339 2018-01-24 03:40:19 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
9340 2018-01-24 03:40:16 As a Sabes fan, probably the most pathetic performance I've seen from an opposing team all year...wondering if this could lead to coaching change for the oil.
9341 2018-01-24 03:40:15 Honestly convinced dis team beez hung. Dis could beez top 5 worst effort I've seen of eh oil team. 

On eh side note
@pizza73 
Uze cardboard za looks better den de @EdmontonOilers
9342 2018-01-24 03:40:14 Everybody told me to use castor oil! Coconut oil works too but it clogs pores. What makeup remover are you using to wipe off mascara btw? Cause that can be why your eyelashes came off while curling them
9343 2018-01-24 03:40:04 Because Oregon snake oil sales are up 30% so far in the month of January.  People are curious whether this is an anomaly.
9344 2018-01-24 03:40:01 I had a nice bread bun with butter and olive oil. One of my most favorite things to have when I’m bored that is.
9345 2018-01-24 03:39:54 Climate change is just a zephyr, not an existential threat. Just ask any oil company lobbyist.
9346 2018-01-24 03:39:53 Been in bed sick all day. I defer until Thursday when the Oil kick your ass.
9347 2018-01-24 03:39:53 i'm not the one spreading #oil industry propaganda in the age of accelerating #climatechange, which #climatescience has determined per our #peerreview process is the effect (since the industrial revolution) of ~7 Billion ppl burning #fossilfuels. #exxonknew >as did #KochBrothers
9348 2018-01-24 03:39:45 When You Rub Olive Oil All Over Your Hands!!! :)
9349 2018-01-24 03:39:42 I'm skeptical these will work for high-pain patients. I agree it should be legal and can do some good and the oil works well for seizures, but marijuana isn't going to cure all.
9350 2018-01-24 03:39:38 He is not for the people unless you are a gun toting oil Rich one percent for all that do not understand this he is for the very rich in his world that is Americans
9351 2018-01-24 03:39:37 Someone gets poofed tomorrow.
9352 2018-01-24 03:39:36 Love how Oil and Nuclear have enjoyed super massive subsidies in the US, but it's solar strategy is tariffs.
RIP America, land of the false reality of Christ! 
9353 2018-01-24 03:39:33 Joel 2:24 (KJV)  And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.
9354 2018-01-24 03:39:32 Best check into the chemistry of oil frying & that candle that says its better to your mind. #EducationIsKey
9355 2018-01-24 03:39:31 Now do one where the oil drop is a corn cob
9356 2018-01-24 03:39:25 Tariffs on solar panels play right into the Trump kleptocracy fossil fuel free for all to drill in the offshore waters of coastal states (excepting of course Florida, home of Mar-a-Lago and Trump beachfront properties). Imagine how oil rigs and oily beaches will affect tourism.
9357 2018-01-24 03:39:01 Love being on with you! Happy to burn the midnight oil to get you the latest.
9358 2018-01-24 03:38:35 Why would the U.K want go to war with Russia ? Because U.K has been trading with the U.S.S.R for year's and mean year's. U.S.A would love to control Russia oil reserve's.
9359 2018-01-24 03:38:29 Trying your CBD oil for the first time. So far, I'm enjoying the results!
9360 2018-01-24 03:38:27 One more day of work, an oil change then @DISupdates Thursday! #experiencemazda
9361 2018-01-24 03:38:26 This makes SO MUCH more sense. I kept thinking.. what kinda pasta? Red sauce? White sauce? Oil butter? Then I had the hubby bring home Johnny Carinos  #butforeal
9362 2018-01-24 03:38:26 Okay getting an essential oil diffuser was the best decision I’ve made in a long time
9363 2018-01-24 03:38:07 MORNING CLOSING: DALIAN SOYBEAN OIL (May18)

9365 2018-01-24 03:37:57 CBK forecast Kenya's economy to grow 6.2% on good policies. Kenya's oil imports for current financial year expected to jump to 3.3% to GDP up from 3% recorded in 2016 #magazetini
9366 2018-01-24 03:37:56 Total number of Solar Energy Jobs in the U.S. = 260,077

☞Total number of Coal Jobs in the U.S. = 76,572

Trump is taxing the Solar industry at 30% while giving money to the coal industry.

Why?

Because Russia hates Green Energy. It kills the market for their only export: OIL
9367 2018-01-24 03:37:40 you should save the olive oil for after youve finished the pasta in the sauce
9368 2018-01-24 03:37:35 Can I stop watching now???? Another total embarrassment by the hapless Oil.
9369 2018-01-24 03:37:33 This conspiracy is not only about looting our oil and gas reserves but also exploiting our resources to expand their market price and eventually wage a war to the humanity to rule the world. Some people may not believe this but it's a fact.
9370 2018-01-24 03:37:06 I thought the days of checking who was in the Top 10 of the draft were over once we got McDavid. 

Boy was I wrong. I hope we draft well this year, & help put pieces around McDavid. #LetsGoOilers

Going to leave Twitter till the season is over, see you in a while Oil Country!

9378 2018-01-24 03:36:31 I told my sister that her cat wants to fight a cat outside the window and she said “lavender oil in the diffuser”  I have taught her well
9379 2018-01-24 03:36:27 get some of that wild growth oil.
9380 2018-01-24 03:36:24 Elvis @rolex2 how about go get a job with big oil there in PA which has a lot of opportunities between Houston and Lake Charles. Pull your big girl panties up and do something with your life besides bitch
9381 2018-01-24 03:36:22 Heh! I need more coconut oil, butter, and a MUCH larger popcorn pan. This is getting good.

9386 2018-01-24 03:35:31 I went in for oil and an oil filter and left with that but some other shit too  i got home and my dad was like ay Gisel si no lo necesitas no lo compres
9387 2018-01-24 03:35:25 Honestly man, I don't think many actually believe it was ever realistic but it gives them something
9388 2018-01-24 03:35:17 I like to do a Mediterranean style concoction. Quinoa, garlic, zucchini, tomato, red pepper, olive oil, mint or basil. Serve warm or chilled
9389 2018-01-24 03:35:12 Try using peppermint oil on your temples. It will help ease them! 
9390 2018-01-24 03:35:04 Bud: what does yer daddy do?
Pam: daddy does oil and all that that implies...
9391 2018-01-24 03:34:46 Coconut oil is sooooo hyped don’t @ me
9392 2018-01-24 03:34:32 My Aunt told me CBD oil is great for pain, can buy it online, no THC May be worth a try?
9393 2018-01-24 03:34:32 Why no comments are coming about the oil prices hike which is probably the highest in the world and what is the Government doing for the common people. Only rhetoric’s of the taxonomy.
9394 2018-01-24 03:34:31 Horrendous game by the Oil! They seem to have given up after the second goal! Talbot is only part to blame, no passion, no grit, horrible defense and even worse offense! All around sucks, changes need to be made.
9395 2018-01-24 03:34:28 the oil will coat the pasta when you drain it and the pasta will not hold whatever your sauce is as well as it should.
9396 2018-01-24 03:34:12 You did the chemistry or never noticed the car vape & cooking oil fumes?
9397 2018-01-24 03:34:12 Rising oil prices, we as citizens of this country are ready to chip in up to 100 rs a litre. New India

9410 2018-01-24 03:33:28 I bought it this way from Church's 18 years ago.  Has 18.4x38 Firestone radials.  Not very original, but is what it is.  Probably had 18.4x34's original.  I think she's a 1965, but I need to double check.  Has the Roosa Master injection pump and not a cast oil pan.

9421 2018-01-24 03:32:05 Well, Norway seems to have figured it out, but they also have oil. I'm aware that it's a complex issue, but profit-driven HC has badly deteriorated the system. Speaking as a nurse who's now a patient, what we have now is unsustainable. And people are dying.

9433 2018-01-24 03:30:14 I sometimes worry we're in a bubble. Bubbles are often deflated by an oil price shock. But I think things are WAY better now than in 2006/2007 for US oil. We import just a fifth the oil we did then, & our cars & airplanes are about 30% more efficient. We're FAR less exposed now.
9434 2018-01-24 03:30:07 Regardless of timber, oil, natural gas, our people are our most valuable resources, and we need to take care of them.

9442 2018-01-24 03:28:33 We’ve got scaffolding for bulk oil and miscellaneous fluids. Might see if we can add some extra shelving levels. Steel siding so washing it will brighten it up.

9542 2018-01-24 03:18:10 Oh, no problem John. The Oilers worst home games this season have been against the wings, coyotes (even tho they still won), and Flyers fresh off their 10 game slump. The Sabres aren’t doing anything, the Oil expect it to be handed to them, which is why they’re a joke

☞Total number of Coal Jobs in the U.S. = 76,572

Trump is taxing the Solar industry at 30% while giving money to the coal industry.

Why?

Because Russia hates Green Energy. It kills the market for their only export: OIL

9579 2018-01-24 03:12:41 As a solar company, we are devastated to learn Trump has imposed a 30% tariff on solar panels virtually killing the solar industry. Solar employs more people than coal and oil combined. today's decision will cause the loss of roughly 23,000 American jobs this year.
9580 2018-01-24 03:12:41 Oil doesn't benefit from this. Most utilities don't either. It will slightly reduce demand and increase cost, but only marginally. The panel is less than half the cost of installing. Installers margins will be compressed slightly
9581 2018-01-24 03:12:39 It can be our future in the US, if major energy firms invest in alternatives, but they’re not going to heavily...

they’ve kept Tesla technology under lock & key for decades to suppress energy efficiency as long as possible to keep oil profits up. so we will always see things like this 
9694 2018-01-24 02:59:21 I’m licking salt and bought a magnesium powder to team with my tabs. And I’ll eat an avo and coconut oil for potassium!
9695 2018-01-24 02:59:15 X ejemplo la baja del preciobdel gas oil si no se hubiera tenido q capitalizar ancap era posible o la baja de la electricidad comoplanteo el directorio de ute, hay q bajar costo a los q producen xq el mundo es nuestra competencia
9696 2018-01-24 02:59:14 They should be mailed to a crucifix and slathered in cooking oil in the dead heat of june
9697 2018-01-24 02:59:09 If you’re idea of moisturizing your body is just using coconut oil & nothing else then ew
9698 2018-01-24 02:59:05 coconut oil is re-cancelled because my coconut oil has mold in it 
9699 2018-01-24 02:59:02 castor oil helps them grow, get an old mascara wand and wash it that way you can brush on the oil at night it really works 
9700 2018-01-24 02:58:31 特別意識はしてないけど、腹が大きいから多分その方がバランスいいんじゃないかなと思ってる節はある！
9701 2018-01-24 02:58:26 so much "worst in league" stats with oilers & sabres. And oil is so far trying to be the worst of the worst.
9702 2018-01-24 02:58:24 もうお昼か。布団から出よう
9703 2018-01-24 02:58:22 I don't, but you sure could!  If they have egg-free pasta, I can usually get 'em to whip up pasta w sauteed veggies, & olive oil, too. I've gotten great on the fly meals by asking servers for help. I hate going hungry!
9704 2018-01-24 02:58:16 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
9705 2018-01-24 02:58:06 First solo oil change was a success.
9706 2018-01-24 02:57:40 Stupid Jim. If you were to actually read & comprehend, you might realize that the oil spill you are referring to is as a result of two ocean freighters, ie SH I PS, one of which carried said spilled oil. Hole being sealed in sunken freighter now. 0 to do with offshore drilling.
9707 2018-01-24 02:57:36 glad there won't be any oil drilling off the coasts to get the Russian guests messy.
9708 2018-01-24 02:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
9709 2018-01-24 02:57:29 are you short or long oil?
9710 2018-01-24 02:57:15 Oooh yeah fish oil pills and garlic pills work too
9711 2018-01-24 02:57:02 I’m just gonna give Noel some coconut oil and lavender to run out with while I act like my water broke and distract them
9712 2018-01-24 02:56:50 Attention!!

9714 2018-01-24 02:56:23 WHY THE FUCK DOES EVERY BUSINESS USE CANOLA & SOYBEAN OIL??????
9715 2018-01-24 02:56:21 i can explane but r you ready to digest .because if anybody would give gold mine to a negative person then also ,he try to find crude oil in that .in opposite condition to vice versa.
9716 2018-01-24 02:56:11 Sometimes you need to put coconut  oil in your hair, do some yoga, drink lemon water, and make yourself a bomb dinner. #treatyoself
9717 2018-01-24 02:55:52 You go in for a free oil change and end up with a bill.

They advertise $xx.xx brake job. You go in but all of a sudden you need calipers, brake flush, etc for 500 more than you expected.

I typically see warranty work written off as completed but they never touched said parts.
9718 2018-01-24 02:55:50 First oil game let’s go mcdaddy #LetsGoOilers

9723 2018-01-24 02:54:45 Taylor dipped a tampon in weed oil for me  my pussy bout to get fucked up 
9724 2018-01-24 02:54:39 The destruction of the solar industry began when Reagan tore off the panels from the White House & handed the manufacturing to China instead. Same old GOP playbook to help their buddies in the oil industry instead of Americans.

9728 2018-01-24 02:54:20 Savita Oil Technologies 
- Co. to buyback 2.8 lakh shares (~1.92% equity) at Rs 1,605 per share.
9729 2018-01-24 02:54:12 @NOW1SOLAR So you buy Chinese Slave Labor made solar panels and parts. Then you  have them shipped half way around the world on Chinese OIL burning Super  Tankers to the US.  Then you have Illegal Aliens  install them for you.  How is this good for anyone but you?
9730 2018-01-24 02:53:56 A Becca skin perfector, a makeup forever blush, a Clinique eye cream, and a fresh lip balm! And then the bonus was a hair oil
9731 2018-01-24 02:53:53 I hope you enjoy it, despite its relentless pessimism.Tell me to shut up if annoying, but pay attention to the oil stove in the hideaway bedroom, its important and is often overlooked. And the paperweight but I've always assumed this to be a metaphor describing the arrested past.
9732 2018-01-24 02:53:49 Aku kerja oil & gas kat kitchen pun tak hebah kat orang. Eleh berkait sangat.
9733 2018-01-24 02:53:32 ok I killed the elephant and then started a side event where I have to rescue civilians who are in these wooden cages, but I got caught and had to fight guards nearby. The problem was, my sword is on fire and there's oil everywhere so all those cages are burning w/ people in them
9734 2018-01-24 02:53:18 This is why i DO NOT TRUST AUTO SHOPS. Make sure when you guys get a oil change that they change the oil and the oil filter, because I took my truck in to get a oil change at Jiffy Lube and they didn’t change my oil filter.
9735 2018-01-24 02:53:14 I have to grease/oil my hair everyday bra, the shit eat it like it’s food!
9736 2018-01-24 02:53:06 I have potentially one more hit left in my vaporizer, no idea when i can get weed again. Maybe crack this disposable oil cart open for any remainder inside it??? I need weed
9737 2018-01-24 02:52:52 Car insurance should actually be useful. Like if I'm paying you $200 a month throw in an oil change or something, goodness.
9738 2018-01-24 02:52:46 I really just got followed through every single isle of sprouts like I was stealing. Lmao I’ve never stolen in my life but now I might have to steal some lavender oil since they stressed a bitch out so much 
9739 2018-01-24 02:52:28 Ok. Oil firms should cease allowing the sale of their gasoline to those municipalities. Easy fix. They can keep their environment pristine and ride bikes everywhere
9740 2018-01-24 02:52:28 He's not anti renewables, he's pro oil companies for as long as possible. I would assume.
9741 2018-01-24 02:52:16 กะลังย้อนแย้งอยู่ ว่าจะทีมนิวท์หรือทีมมินโฮ
9742 2018-01-24 02:52:13 Put that in your Oil if Olay cheer
9743 2018-01-24 02:52:08 The U.S. dollar Index just broke below 90.  Which will happen first, Dollar Index breaks below 80, Gold breaks above $1,500, 10-year treasury yield rises above 4%, or oil prices rise above $100 per barrel?  What happens to the stock market & the economy if all 4 happen this year?
9744 2018-01-24 02:52:01 Kenzie trying to say coconut oil is so cute
9745 2018-01-24 02:51:47 Has she noticed a difference in the thickness of her hair? I was looking to see if anyone used just the oil itself.
9746 2018-01-24 02:51:45 Thank you! Im a perfectionist when it comes to art outlets so it sucks bc I’m hard on myself I use some coconut oil moisturizing cream, pons, Aragon oil and my 3 in 1 hangover spray
9747 2018-01-24 02:51:39 Thank-you.  Add that OPEC knows the world needs to find, and exploit, new reserves, NOW!  If we do not, it will be a oil crisis, and that will lead to an increase in green energy use/development, out of desperation.  Even $70 oil won't achieve that big need. #bigpicture #OOTT
9748 2018-01-24 02:51:36 Uh, that's West Texas oil.....Canada is always $12 lower; $48 a bbl. But better than $36.
9749 2018-01-24 02:51:33 dont listen to Jamie. Rinse them in cold water, shred them, add almonds and grapes, olives oil, lemon juice, parm and salt.
9750 2018-01-24 02:51:33 ふぁいおー！！
9751 2018-01-24 02:51:26 Another concession to big oil.

9754 2018-01-24 02:51:16 Do we have to do the Oil of Olay cheer?
9755 2018-01-24 02:51:14 (+) OIL: ราคาน้ำมันดิบวานนี้ WTI +1.54% สู่ $64.47/bbl / BRT +1.35% สู่ $69.96/bbl  #โนมูระ
9756 2018-01-24 02:51:13 His policies will transform us into a 3rd-world country selling its natural resources to survive. Why he's opened coastlines to oil drilling, slashed size of natl monuments to extract resources. Used to be illegal for US to sell & export oil. + This is planetary destruction.
9757 2018-01-24 02:51:11 It's really hard to watch tonight.  Buffalo played last night and are hustling.  Oil are flat and need to get skating.  Plus if I see one more drop pass to set up the power play I'm going to lose it hahaha.

9761 2018-01-24 02:50:48 Like Ida Tarbell offended Standard Oil. Such impertinence!
9762 2018-01-24 02:50:46 Wow Ken.  Rather disappointed you employ cheap tricks in your line of work. Charging anything more than .60 as a fee is certainly a cheap trick at client’s expense.
9763 2018-01-24 02:50:32 Don’t ever shave with coconut oil 
9764 2018-01-24 02:50:11 I’d rather run out of cooking oil than any of my essential oils
9765 2018-01-24 02:50:10 I mean, I have been known to grill a halved romaine heart and then douse it with good olive oil and crumbled bacon and homemade buttermilk dressing. BUT THAT IS A BOWL OF LEAVES AND A PRESSURE COOKER!
9766 2018-01-24 02:50:04 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
9767 2018-01-24 02:49:45 So you buy Chinese Slave Labor made solar panels and parts. Then you have them shipped half way around the world on Chinese OIL burning Super Tankers to the US.  Then you have Illegal Aliens  install them for you. How is this good for anyone but you and a few Greedy Buddy's?

9769 2018-01-24 02:49:39 Maybe you’re too young for the Beverly Hillbillies but did you know Texas had oil?  No need for coal in Texas.

9774 2018-01-24 02:48:44 It's not a good thing to aim for, TBH. She was a little scurry. (peppermint oil works, too, I think)
9775 2018-01-24 02:48:40 WHAT PROGRESSIVES HATE THE MOST
#Trumps success in deregulating the steel, coal,& oil industries resulting in a soaring economy.
9776 2018-01-24 02:48:34 Oil is okay too
9777 2018-01-24 02:48:33 Coconut oil?
9778 2018-01-24 02:48:14 “Here is an image with hard/sharp fonts to make sure people know this stats are SUPER legit”...This isn’t teacher projector time where we will believe any statistic ( Dem or Rep)but I will say it is really sad that you do. I guess snake oil can be an internet term too.
9779 2018-01-24 02:48:02 Guess what, "America Started off wrong & will End Wrong" when it comes to the "White Man Establishment," what was done Right? The divide has been since the Establishment of America and prior...with the raping of Africa's Gold, Oil & Diamonds. The "White Man's GOD" ~ Hunnee

9781 2018-01-24 02:47:39 trump is gonna bring back the coal industry, remember? Yep, the US will be running on filthy oil, explosive gas, radioactive/contaminating uranium and  "clean" coal (an oxymoron if there ever was one) while the rest of the world uses safe, free solar and wind power. SMH
9782 2018-01-24 02:47:38 UCP have no policies. I mean what do they think of the oil and gas industry? The Redwater decision? How are they going to increase revenue? So what about gay marriages? What about abortion? That sort of stuff. Personally I feel the state should stay out of folks' homes. @jkenney
9783 2018-01-24 02:47:32 Where are the women working on oil rigs? Where are the women working with garbage collection? Where are the women being drafted into pointless wars to be treated as nothing more than a meat shield and a loss of military equipment? Oh, my mistake.
9784 2018-01-24 02:47:19 The fact that the FBI was a secret den of leftists was our second best kept secret!

9787 2018-01-24 02:47:00 The wars of the future will be fought over water and not oil... technology companies will have to find innovative ways to create clean water  as that resource will be depleted by climate change and droughts.

9800 2018-01-24 02:45:02 Well the article doesn’t say so. I just assumed he had a mutant gene that let him metabolize airplane engine oil.
9801 2018-01-24 02:44:48 Lavender and orange essential oils in my diffuser, sleepytime tea, sleep lotion from bath and body, sleep room mist, amethyst with orange essential oil under my pillow. Here’s hoping I sleep tonight!
9802 2018-01-24 02:44:43 Why, does the USD come with 4,000,000 barrels of oil tucked under its arm?
9803 2018-01-24 02:44:43 Ooo Tuesday night I might mess around and add an extra drop of lavender oil to my diffuser :P
9804 2018-01-24 02:44:40 It’s mind blowing that there is really Niggas out here who don’t know how to change the oil in a car.
9805 2018-01-24 02:44:40 Welcome to the energy tax.  What, you think oil and coal aren’t taxed?  If your making money, the government wants some. Welcome to the big leagues.

9811 2018-01-24 02:43:48 Mexico receives more money from workers here in the US sending money home to families there then any over industry. More then all their oil & natural gas companies combined.
9812 2018-01-24 02:43:48 FYI: if you’re someone who stresses a lot, like me, add a few drops of lavender essential oil to your bath. WORKS MIRACLES
9813 2018-01-24 02:43:44 That’s what I was thinking .. she needs a little oil sheen #Dry #RHOBH
9814 2018-01-24 02:43:42 So I had this dream I was riding this old motorcycle and it backfired and sprayed oil into my mouth and I could taste it And it was like the worst taste ever. Then I woke up and my dogs butt was right in my face and realized she farted into my mouth while i was sleeping
9815 2018-01-24 02:43:40 Flax seed Oil and seeds also helps menstruating women by maintaining their cycle, the oil also has great benefits to menopausal women and decreasing hormonal imbalance.
It is also a great option for your nails, eyes and hair.

9823 2018-01-24 02:42:46 Today at work, one of the drains in the bathroom smelled awful and stank up our hallway, it smelled like rotting vegetables and we tried everything from pouring bleach and hot water down there to spraying essential oil down the hallway and vaccuming

9827 2018-01-24 02:42:15 Louie Gohmert, a person who doesn't "believe in climate change" & the fact that humans are exacerbating the situation. Who also wants drilling in our national parks. Pretty sure conservatives who like to hunt will also like a big oil rig killing all the wildlife they want to hunt

9838 2018-01-24 02:41:13 We need to stop selling 99% of our oil to the US at discounted rates and then buying 700,000 barrels a day at world price. It has cost us over a $100 billion.
9839 2018-01-24 02:41:12 Typical. The US looks set to surpass Saudi Arabia as oil KINGS and they think they're too good to reciprocate love from Australia smdh cunts

9854 2018-01-24 02:39:12 So lost. We have not touched all oil sources. Nuclear is safe now. Coal, with new technology is good and employees many. You sound like Obama
9855 2018-01-24 02:39:07 I'm not supporting additional drilling. Surely the Macondo spill illustrated the impact an accident can have on fishers, their livelihoods, and the economy. But we provide oil, we take the risk, and states that don't drill enjoy the benefits.
9856 2018-01-24 02:39:04 The memo, written by republicans, is NOT evidence of FISA abuse. Even if Trump Dossier was the only piece of evidence used to get FISA warrant it wouldn't be illegal or an abuse of power. Dossier Fact: Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

9904 2018-01-24 02:31:15 Think commod weakness in its own right could be cause for concern, if it comes to pass.  EMFX implications obvious but oil also large component of Euro Area inflation and expectations for tightening in EU vs US would come in

9907 2018-01-24 02:30:26 Not correct the one off of nj has enough oil for over 200 yrs. so imagine all the untapped resources. The 70 yrs which is not exact is in Saudi Arabia. But they have more years left than that. Where do u guys come up with this stuff?

9913 2018-01-24 02:30:03 Again, he won't care now.. he's already had job "optics" to crow about.. his administration ties solar anything to "fake climate change" and this news makes his big oil donors happy...
9914 2018-01-24 02:29:59 the beauty about #essential #oils especially #facial oil is that you can leave the oil on your face for a five minutes then rinse without any damage to your skin.

9924 2018-01-24 02:28:59 probably the only way to fight Oil; corrupt & carefully coordinated monopoly on energy. it’s so wrong governments partner with them to keep them polluting our planet, leaving us without an easily available natural source of energy... all by design of course.

9938 2018-01-24 02:26:50 @NOW1SOLAR I'm disgusted to see that this is happening. What do you think can be done? How can we continue to replace big oil with big solar with this additional 30% tax in place?
