The vast majority of people don’t own stocks. 

Wages are stagnant. 

Jobs created are mostly low wage.

Outsourcing continues.

Prices are up and going higher.

The middle class tax cut is tiny. 

Deficit is way up.

You’re clearly brainwashed. Or rich.

51 2018-08-29 23:46:59 I love when good stocks go down. Easy to justify buying more. I am more bothered when I don’t pull the trigger soon enough with stocks on my watchlist because I’m being too conservative.
52 2018-08-29 23:46:34 So, high stocks are do to stock buybacks which at one time were illegal. Essentially corporations do buybacks to artifically inflate their share values and the result is less material investment. I'm all for high GDP but we need to ban stock buybacks and reinstate glass-steagall.

65 2018-08-29 23:41:17 But due to Bitcoin's deflationary nature, regular people, who don't know how to invest in real estate and stocks will not be robbed by inflation year after year, so it will end up making a more egalitarian society if widely adopted.

73 2018-08-29 23:36:12 Marijuana stocks are all somewhat bogus for this simple reason: No matter how good the business management, the model, the efficiency, the regulatory protection, etc..etc.

80 2018-08-29 23:29:34 You are probably correct. But “what-ifs” don’t always become reality.  I’ll look at what is happening right now. Are stocks artificially soaring?  Most probably.  CAN it have a strong, positive, lasting effect? Sure. Will it? I don’t know. But confidence is high right no  ...
81 2018-08-29 23:29:01 The Trump Economy is booming!! #GDP uptick to 4.2%!!%. Stock Market continues to hit all time highs! As a stock market investor since the mid ‘80s, I tell you it’s the best way to create wealth. If you don’t invest in stocks, learn how. Enjoying letting your work 4 U!
82 2018-08-29 23:28:47 Same age. About 20% stocks. 30% biz. 50% RE.
I'm going to admit and say I'm only here because I read rich dad poor dad. My family was piss poor. No one owned anything. My wife (2nd marriage) is amazed how every month we have this big surplus. used to be breakeven every month.
83 2018-08-29 23:28:18 So...you're boasting about something that hasn't happened yet, or you're lying. Pick one.
Also - the top 1% of Americans own 50% of all stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Kinda hard to enjoy the market when all the gains go to so few.

87 2018-08-29 23:25:53 We have Highs and lows. Its like stocks never sell for a low point pay it no mind.
88 2018-08-29 23:25:14 No effin way.  Have you seen the $SPX. RT @LucidInvestment: Bitcoin prices have made it back up to $7,100. No change in outlook, intermediate target $5,400, long term target $1,000 if $5,400 doesn’t hold on a weekly closing basis. Your money should be in U.S. stocks.
89 2018-08-29 23:24:57 Guy on Channel 4 News said they get over 80% from outside our waters and when they asked a French fisherman, he said it's quite clear why limits are in place in order to replenish stocks.
90 2018-08-29 23:24:57 You can't buy food, clothes or pay bills with stocks and bonuses are not guaranteed. So none of that counts.
91 2018-08-29 23:23:16 Up on low volume and with a huge number of stocks trading near their year low, does not a healthy market. Investors are grasping for straws now, think they are smart enough to pull plug at last moment.
92 2018-08-29 23:22:26 I sure am. Everyone that I speak to are very pleased with the economy under this great President. Pay is up, jobs plentiful, stocks are up, etc. The majority see right through your lying butt. Your a disgrace. #VoteRepublican #walkaway

94 2018-08-29 23:20:46 Pun fest on #C4News earlier re: scallop wars. A "clash of clams", "who is being shellfish here?", etc. I must say, French insistence on conserving stocks does seem more prudent approach.

96 2018-08-29 23:20:28 Hows that NRA money.  People are still affected by One October.  It's not the immigrants we need to worry about - it's   seemingly normal white men.  They've killed more people in mass shootings.  Of course no laws banning bump stocks.  Must not amger the NRA.

101 2018-08-29 23:15:28 Yeah, it's one of the many stocks someone could specialize in and make a living: AMD AAPL  BABA MU NVDA TWTR, a long list of usual suspects.
102 2018-08-29 23:15:13 Personally, I get sick of reading about charts... Stocks don't perform well or poorly in the long term because of a chart. A good investment is based on research, fundamentals, and consumer trends not past movement!
103 2018-08-29 23:14:57 Let me remind eveyone here - Trump spoke to Parkand parents - boasted how no other pres did jack shit . Promised to raise the age to 21 and ban bump stocks . Told his team he’s not afraid of the NRA And they are . Anyone remember that?!!! Or is that an inconvenient truth ?

109 2018-08-29 23:12:10 But even the replaceable vs irreplaceable call is questionable. If a CEO for a Fortune 500 company died suddenly, unless they are at the tail end of their career, the stocks price would plummet.  Rodgers is underpaid, relative to the NFL, still, but to your point....

114 2018-08-29 23:10:13 Guidelines only...you will note stocks, closed end funds, REITs, BDC's, MLP's, and ETNs. Each should be understood by the investor and this takes awhile. Take it slow. Lots of info on Seeking Alpha but like here, be careful of source. Not all good authors.

121 2018-08-29 23:04:46 That's bad math unless no stocks have negative return. Otherwise, sum all positive returning stocks and it adds to more than 100% contribution. Overstating contribution.

123 2018-08-29 23:03:47 My local shop hardly stocks the shelves much these days, but the fridges and store room are crammed with energy drinks for the local school kids.
124 2018-08-29 23:03:24 You are correct.  However, stocks can remain irrational for a very long time.  Thanks!
125 2018-08-29 23:02:21 People are FAR too emotional about their stocks and the game of investment. These aren't pets. Zero loyalty! 
Win or lose, one should aspire to be coldly analytical as ice.  Cut off losers like a diseased limb. 
Save the emotion for  loved ones, pets,  and sports teams.
126 2018-08-29 23:02:12 @CNN  Are we STUPID???  Trump bashes a company; its stock dips for 1-2 days; then goes back up.  Betcha Trump, his swampy oligarchs & BFFs are short-selling & making a profit on these dips!  Check how many times stocks fell, then rose: Boeing, Amazon, Lockheed, GM, etc etc.

128 2018-08-29 23:01:19 99% of professional investors (particularly stocks) think chart based TA is a total joke. There is certainly some use here in crypto for a variety of reasons but it’s amazing people are okay using what is basically super ancient technology
129 2018-08-29 23:01:09 Wow @SenWarren U R absolutely right @TheBeatWithAri I was surprised that d bill that U R putting together NOW, IS NOT ALREADY the law to prevent Govt. officials to trade stocks or, WORSE, TO BE ALLOWED to lobby on behalf of a FOREIGN GOVERNMENT?!! Must Rush @DNC to PASS IT!

131 2018-08-29 23:00:53 #MadTweets Jim can you do some shows on how to choose good CEF's, BDC'S, REITS? In other words higher yielding stocks...
@jimcramer
132 2018-08-29 23:00:38 He science'd the crap out of gravity...
133 2018-08-29 22:59:52 People are FAR too emotional about their stocks and the game of investment. 
Win or lose, one should aspire to be cold as ice.  
Save the emotion for pets, loved ones, and sports teams.
134 2018-08-29 22:59:23 Father's Day specials at MHCC Level 1......starting today until Sunday 02/09/18 or while stocks last!!
135 2018-08-29 22:59:18 Kendricks really an internet nigga in the flesh. He told yall mfs to invest in stocks and get a  passa port
136 2018-08-29 22:58:21 lmao that's so lame XD 
but you're bullish gold now or just the stocks?
137 2018-08-29 22:58:09 @OpTic_BigTymeR Hey BigT, been trading for about 5 years now since MMJ penny stocks back in the day. A good idea for a video and videos that help people that are serious would be how to search / scan for tickers to build trade ideas. IE: How to find something you like.
138 2018-08-29 22:57:57 I find the term "haters" amusing. As if stocks were football teams, and the haters are the opposing teams supporters. Shall we call the longs in Tesla and other concept only stocks, "Pom Pom cheerleaders"? 
For me, as the saying goes....long or short....it's just business.
139 2018-08-29 22:57:55 Now you are trading stocks too! ?
140 2018-08-29 22:57:27 Limited stocks 
140..
141 2018-08-29 22:56:08 You mean the stocks that delivered her a loss of $2,500 to $5000 in 2008.
142 2018-08-29 22:55:49 What is the quote code for stocks?
143 2018-08-29 22:55:07 I think mids are our main focus, but Mitch would beef up our key position stocks nicely. McKay, McGovern and Curnow in the forward line...? That’s a good problem to have. Good teams have those kind of problems.
144 2018-08-29 22:54:10 Extra specials for Homemaker starting today until Saturday 01/09/18 or while stocks last!!
145 2018-08-29 22:53:59 Senator Warren is naive as hell if she thinks the GOP and enough Democrats will support a bill to outlaw people in congress from owning stocks. 

I expect such a bill would be found unconstitutional as well. But she’s running for President, so it sells to the rubes.
146 2018-08-29 22:53:48 Well she did say she came from a very frugal family. She was telling Brett early in the game that they come from similar type families (money wise). She has money markets and blue chip stocks and has paid cash for her cars and truck. It was a fascinating conversation.
147 2018-08-29 22:52:02 For the life of me I cant find anyone that stocks the so called fine link snow chains that @bmwau say I need to use on my X1 25i, help, am running out of time
148 2018-08-29 22:51:26 Proof stocks are a great investment.
149 2018-08-29 22:50:57 Its still going to go lower.  I called it few moths ago when it was still at $12k.  $4k  before it goes higher.  #bitcoin #trader #daytrading #Stocks
150 2018-08-29 22:50:56 Tell that to all the people whose real wages are declining. Tell that to all the people who don't give a damn about the stock market because they're not part of the small  minority which owns most of the stocks.
151 2018-08-29 22:50:26 21 #stocks set all-time highs in technology sector yesterday.
152 2018-08-29 22:48:46 but philip there's a reason property can be geared and stocks can't put property in your graph the way it is used and it beats stocks hands down
153 2018-08-29 22:48:33 The stupid thing is that destroying the stocks by overfishing will ultimately destroy the fishermen's livelihoods. Apparently, that's a too subtle concept for the vote leave crew.
154 2018-08-29 22:48:08 I'm investing in lemon and honey stocks to prep my voice.... That, or whiskey.
155 2018-08-29 22:47:40 So many stocks went global today. Y’all better cop up!!!
156 2018-08-29 22:46:36 The TICK, which measures the number of stocks rising vs falling (more were falling). It was all $AMZN and that turd that Tim Cook was selling today called $AAPL
157 2018-08-29 22:46:30 What’s that got to do with the health of the economy? Just hyping a few - FANG - stocks is not indicative of a successful and healthy economy.
158 2018-08-29 22:46:22 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
159 2018-08-29 22:45:48 I want to learn stocks too
160 2018-08-29 22:45:36 Bro there are frauds who studied economics analysing stocks all day, earning 40K salary. System rigged
161 2018-08-29 22:45:27 Steyer the Gordon Gecko of solar stocks! He is a vulture capitalist!
162 2018-08-29 22:45:24 These are the 3 stocks in finance sector that yesterday marked all-time highs:
$BMO, $PGR, $TD
163 2018-08-29 22:43:22 Are you talking about bump stocks now? It’s not about necessity. It’s about having something you want bc you want it and not being told by someone that you can’t have it. I have a gun safe full of guns, ammo, magazines that I hardly use for practice, but I have it bc I wanted it.
164 2018-08-29 22:42:21 Hear u. I was just suggesting that market makers in stocks or BTC futures put up blocks to facilitate large client order flow. Their ensuing hedge is just a reflection of the initial client flow.
165 2018-08-29 22:41:51 Your batting average is just amazing. I am flat on my stocks, gains are on options. I am really thinking to empty my IRA stock portion and copy yours. LoL
166 2018-08-29 22:41:49 All of you that want to have money at a young age, hope y’all ready to hustle. I work 10-6, currently started running on online business, stream and invest in stocks. If you can’t grind then don’t expect to see the $$$
167 2018-08-29 22:41:49 In my Market Letter recently I observed how the S&P 500 climbed 7% while the ex-US Global index declined 6%, never saw a 13% disparity ever. Said either the S&P declines or foreign stocks need to rally. We finally got a rally in foreign stocks....I’m staying bullish!
168 2018-08-29 22:41:25 Wasn't Mueller involved in the very controversial transfer of 20% of the US Uranium stocks (Uranium One) to Russia that benefited the Clintons and the Clinton Global Initiative?
169 2018-08-29 22:40:37 I get anxiety attacks watching cannabis stocks go up and down but CBD has not helped at all. #IDONTCARE
170 2018-08-29 22:38:57 The economy is working great for those with stocks. nOT the majority of Americans. Republicans are either rich, or fox watching rubes. Check your bank account to see which kind of republican you are. And the rich aren’t trolling twitter.
171 2018-08-29 22:38:27 Absolutely. North Sea has far too many fish in it - makes sailing really difficult. British fishing fleet boats need to get out there & reduce fish stocks so as to reduce the congestion & make sailing easier. Once we are out of the pernicious EU, nothing can stand in our way
172 2018-08-29 22:36:28 Do you know which stocks? 
173 2018-08-29 22:36:27 I almost was going to take it seriously until he recommended going into stocks
174 2018-08-29 22:36:09 Weed stocks 
175 2018-08-29 22:35:38 What value should they be worth? We treating them like stocks or currencies? Keep pushing the price lower for your accumulation.
176 2018-08-29 22:34:57 Sheep!  Educate:  black /Hispanic unemployment  are at an all time low!  The president tried to go into Chicago when he was first elected and was denied.  Stocks and economic growth at an all time high!   I would suggest you see a movie death of a nation.  You will be surprised!
177 2018-08-29 22:34:42 If u are serious about #cannabis / stocks there are three services I would highly recommend:

@Invest420 for stocks

182 2018-08-29 22:32:18 I hope it does happen, my stocks are riding on it

194 2018-08-29 22:26:46 White people been here longer. Owned land, business etc passed it to kids, yes they have more wealth. But system lets you work hard save up buy land, buy stocks etc. Theres opportunity. US you can go from nothing to being a millionaire (system). Unlike Mexico , asian cntries etc

"And to his wife, he leaves his home and car"
"And to his daughter, $25,000 in stocks and bonds"
*waits my turn*
"And to his grandson Brady, he leaves all of his Imagine Dragon records"

198 2018-08-29 22:25:16 Howard caught hell for that, too (and rightfully so!)
199 2018-08-29 22:25:11 I've been hearing about high valuation when the stock was $45 pre 4:1 split a few years back. Stocks go up and down, but if you have longer term view, CRM is buy even at these levels. Good luck.
200 2018-08-29 22:24:49 Not that i’m aware of. It’s while stocks last. Best to get your preorder in soon just in case tho!
201 2018-08-29 22:24:43 Too right. EU regulation replaced fish stocks. But let's ignore that because will of the people.
202 2018-08-29 22:23:39 Sometimes I wonder if I should have stayed in tech stocks this year 
203 2018-08-29 22:23:11 Now the new obsession of @CNBC are pot stocks
204 2018-08-29 22:22:32 Has he only recommended winning stocks every 13 years?
205 2018-08-29 22:22:05 @carterthomas  any insight into your favorite cannabis stocks?
206 2018-08-29 22:21:54 WIFE:  Joe's wife said he took off the whole week cause trading will be slow this wk.. how come everybody else is taking ...

207 2018-08-29 22:21:38 Yeah i got more stocks then crypto
208 2018-08-29 22:20:35 Just want to check a few things; 

This took place 15 miles off the French coastline where the channel is 100 miles wide.

The French don't fish this time of year to ensure the stocks are sustainable and populations recover.
209 2018-08-29 22:20:32 Stocks
210 2018-08-29 22:20:26 Noooooo trump, consumer confidence is high because you are telling the people the market is doing good and they put more money in the market! You are doing this to let the rich take all the common person’s money when the rich sell of  their stocks “BIGLY”!! 
211 2018-08-29 22:20:25 and he will take away your pre-existing conditions protection...and chip away at your social security and medicare...all so that rich people can buy back their stocks and get a tax break on their private jets and yachts.
212 2018-08-29 22:20:25 In the next 2 years US stocks will see a major correction that will cascade into the world markets causing immense losses for some while others will over take American industry for Satoshis on the dollar.
213 2018-08-29 22:20:21 Don't play the penny stocks.
214 2018-08-29 22:19:57 i usually think its better to train your mentality outside of the game as much as possible with diet exercise meditation sleep etc, but in the moment just taking a deep breath between stocks and remembering your goals, focusing on whats in front of you is most important.
215 2018-08-29 22:19:35 Let's see if $AMZN can hold get through and hold above 2000 tomorrow... Even numbers are resistance points for stocks, so be open minded to puts.....
216 2018-08-29 22:18:31 This is sarcasm... peeps would u still invest in stocks seriously its about to bust just look at the charts..
217 2018-08-29 22:18:10 Bought stocks into a marijuana growing company today. Come on legalization!
218 2018-08-29 22:18:00 You only like to hold bags when it comes to pot stocks. Figured you didn't want to hold a winner . It either cracks the 50 day and bail, or ramps here and potential gap fill
219 2018-08-29 22:17:28 Many Trumpers will not understand this graph . At the beginning of Obama's presidency unemployment was 9.5% & Stocks were under 9,000 when he left office 4.5%& 19,000. Trump has improved on them. Give Obama credit idiots
220 2018-08-29 22:16:50 Wife did $STAA and now I'm on deck for $ALGN. Between her eyes and my bite we're looking at $15k after insurance. No wonder these stocks are on 
221 2018-08-29 22:16:27 They give you stocks as bonus?
222 2018-08-29 22:15:47 Not a word about the French banning scallop fishing until October to protect stocks in the longer term.
223 2018-08-29 22:15:35 Gonna start buying my nieces and nephews stocks instead of a toy or clothes. They won't understand, but when they're at least 18 they'll have some capital to do w.e they wanna do.
224 2018-08-29 22:15:14 He’s full of bull.  He doesn’t mean a word.  Where’s the ban on bump stocks.  Where’s the DACA bill with heart? Where’s the wall that Mexico was going to pay for? He’s a con man.
225 2018-08-29 22:13:24 C'mon human, just rethink your position in Flowers Foods $FLO #Stocks
226 2018-08-29 22:13:18 Bullshit.  Trump doesn’t mean anything he says.  Where’s the ban on bump stocks he promised.  Where’s the wall that Mexico was going to pay for? Where’s the denuclearization of North Korea?  He’s a conman!
227 2018-08-29 22:13:07 I had told you let it go and buy low, bunch of people got stuck. But stocks different more regulated
228 2018-08-29 22:12:51 Everyone sit back and watch the magic. @realDonaldTrump is a straightshooter and the PC police won't hold him down. Trump brought us back from the brink record breaking stocks, united the masses, cured syphilis (his own) and grabbed Mary by the p#ssy. #maga #Donthecon
229 2018-08-29 22:12:41 Big corporations are breaking up unions to keep wages down at the same time they are buying back their own stocks at record numbers. They are donating to GOP Congressmen to look the other way and not enforce laws to protect the workers.
230 2018-08-29 22:12:27 I'm so happy I put my money into American stocks. Keep the success coming!
231 2018-08-29 22:11:40 Quite honestly, the fact that only 25% of people own stocks is extremely good news. It means for an extraordinary 20-year period of solid stock market gains from millions who are fearing 2008 when a strong trend period is just beginning
232 2018-08-29 22:11:01 that will hit stocks, especially when combined with overvaluation. And of course, we have CB tightening, and 10 straight yrs (if this yr doesn't decline sharply) of up markets has never occurred in history. Also, growth killing value/cyclicals happens at end of move.
233 2018-08-29 22:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
234 2018-08-29 22:09:19 both ways, what deems great high value the market doesnt react to it really depends. Found the cheap value dogs will sit around longer at a base... High growth stocks do deliver more often, but u get the ocasional turd
235 2018-08-29 22:09:14 I should start buying beer stocks. Sales would go thru the roof when Trump is out.

240 2018-08-29 22:06:49 @richmarketguy says carries are huge in the markets right now. The market is telling farmers to store the crop. “Likely to see big grain stocks again in U.S.”
241 2018-08-29 22:06:39 You’re becoming quite the bear Brian. I agree the market being driven by a handful of stocks (most of witch at generous valuations) is the one obvious risk that is out there.
242 2018-08-29 22:05:50 Pensemoslo sin gob que es más fácil. Para que eso sea una característica "permanente" de un país, tiene que ser x flujos, no x stocks. Si es por flujos, tiene que venir de un exceso de ahorro sobre inversión (balance del sector privado)...

249 2018-08-29 22:03:13 Does it count if you're insider trading Packers "stocks"?  If so, we need to talk.
250 2018-08-29 22:01:33 this is a seismic bull move. credit due to @allstarcharts who has been consistent and vocal for MONTHS in preparing his acolytes for this face ripper. dude is in a league of his own. or maybe just the hardest worker. thanks JC! $SPY $IWM $QQQ #stocks

255 2018-08-29 21:58:43 Same for all the weed stocks theyve been pumping this week.
256 2018-08-29 21:57:42 People invest in stocks to retire comfortably at age 65.

People invest in crypto to change their life and the world today.

260 2018-08-29 21:55:07 LOL, you actually think the stock market is relevant? #Twitler’s massive tax breaks to the wealthy and big biz lead to a huge buy back of stocks driving up prices. That has nothing to do with economy except that a bunch of money was removedfrom it.
261 2018-08-29 21:54:29 Some you people have to be investing in stocks ? ETFs ? Bonds ? or Something ?
262 2018-08-29 21:54:00 People are a little drunk on pot stocks right now. Shades me out. Drunk + pot = .... most of the time, sometimes you just get really high though, so we will see.

264 2018-08-29 21:53:39 Surely it makes sense to allow #Scallops stocks to replenish - for both #French & #British #fishermen? #ScallopWar #Newsnight
265 2018-08-29 21:53:37 Must order some new stocks! There’s an infestation!
266 2018-08-29 21:52:32 Compound returns also come from stocks that pay high dividends and reinvestments in growth companies that investors believe will one day pay huge dividends. Banks are the ones that prefer higher interest only because they are legally required to hold lower risk securities
267 2018-08-29 21:51:56 The two stocks I own currently are $AMZN and $BILI and I feel like a genius
268 2018-08-29 21:51:44 We have hydro and wind and some coal and even a nuclear plant in WA, its called diversification.  But fossil fuel use is a downward slide as it impacts others in time, from wildfires to fish stocks to having to move naval bases
269 2018-08-29 21:51:36 30% Returns on Square stocks  , I just want to risk it all put everything I have in & dip out real quick
270 2018-08-29 21:51:30 Thank you @realDonaldTrump for helping my stocks, for making black unemployment at its lowest, for finally enforcing the policy on illegals so we don’t have to pay their taxes, schooling and health care.
271 2018-08-29 21:51:12 There's always panic in Tariff "wars". Harley 6% tariff to Europe, is now 31%. Sales are down in the U.S, but growing in Europe. So, HD is planning on moving manufacturing to Brazil, Philippines, ect. to avoid additional tariffs. Stocks take a hit. Wait and see what happens.
272 2018-08-29 21:47:51 No borrow at IB so it's irrelevant for me.... the pot stocks on the other hand....
273 2018-08-29 21:47:50 We had some Honeycrisp one year that were wonderful – our Walmart usually stocks a dozen or so varieties in the fall.
274 2018-08-29 21:47:11 Me 2 days ago:

276 2018-08-29 21:46:21 “cite the abuses of power” canceling the new FBI building for personal profit, tipping Carl Icahn on stocks to sell, using Mar-a-Lago to enrich himself

“Firing Comey” Don’t agree it’s a full stop. Doing something w/in your power for corrupt reasons is still a crime.
277 2018-08-29 21:46:18 I walk in my macroeconomics class and the first thing I hear my professor say is “man have you see the pot stocks lately?”

279 2018-08-29 21:45:15 Maybe but showing some nice strength now. I’ve been in for a while so I know the volatility of these stocks.
280 2018-08-29 21:44:50 After regaining the 90% of fish stocks they've lost, I'd be surprised they'd waste that much diesel getting there.
281 2018-08-29 21:44:30 #skypapers @toryboypierce @Kevin_Maguire #ScallopWars has shown that nothing will change post #Brex as it's come to light quoter are openly sold on the market &  resold often by non fisherman. Then we also see  fisherman lack of responsible fishing to preserve stocks #FO
282 2018-08-29 21:43:56 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
283 2018-08-29 21:43:31 Springer and Simon being excluded seems odd, but with Escare and Gigot I imagine they feel they've enough stocks of fullbacks without having to dip back into the residency rule
284 2018-08-29 21:43:29 I have been bullish the last 5 years but with the increase of  interest rates and the incredibly high valuations of bonds, stocks and real estate, I only see one direction: SOUTH. 
The only question is timing, end of 2018 or 2019,...so this time is not different, gravity exists.
285 2018-08-29 21:43:03 The French threw stones at British fishing boats operating near Normandy. Spain depleted our stocks; yet we did not resort to violence.
286 2018-08-29 21:42:41 Stop spreading insane speculations.
You people go on and on about Russia's dog, yet our relationship is back to cold war era.
Now you're going to spread BS about helping China, did you forget that we are in a trade war that is crashing their stocks??
Opposite of helping China smh
287 2018-08-29 21:42:35 I totally agree with you. I tell everyone I know about Aurora being the Amazon of pot stocks. Look at what Amazon did to get where they are they expanded there market reach kinda like what $acbff is doing.
288 2018-08-29 21:41:52 People have committed suicide bc of watching your Fake News night after night Anderson ; ' Trump is going to start WW111, the Stocks will crash, Gays will be carted up an btw he really hates Blacks.'

291 2018-08-29 21:40:48 everything is either exploding higher or looks like it wants to explode higher. this is a massive bull move. huge money behind this. anyone who was making the weak volume or breadth argument has been shot out of the sky. $SPY #stocks #rainingmoney

294 2018-08-29 21:39:35 $AFMD has a large float, so I find it extremely difficult for the price to be pushed higher. Stocks like $IGC are low float low market cap
295 2018-08-29 21:39:01 Selling the top on pot stocks too? @CNBCFastMoney why isn't everyone counter trading these jack asses?
296 2018-08-29 21:37:34 Scientific advice informed restriction of scallop fishing in the area until 1st October to protect stocks. But also fishing methods preferred by large British trawlers are considered to cause damage to sea bed. This is battle between French fishermen and British big business.

318 2018-08-29 21:27:38 @CNBCFastMoney  I cannot believe that you think that Amazon is so great. They want split their stock.  The average investor can't afford the stock. However, it is not the only absurdly priced stock. They simply don't want the average investor in these pricey stocks.

May I ask what’s your thoughts on APH after another great run today closed at $16.30?
340 2018-08-29 21:15:09 there are two industries who's stocks I do not wish to buy into, bitcoin are one of them. Can you guess what the other one is? :)
341 2018-08-29 21:14:58 The British fisherman were deliberately provoking the French.  Restrictions in fishing are necessary to maintain stocks, the British should respect this
342 2018-08-29 21:12:40 yes--Amazing  and stocks Up
343 2018-08-29 21:12:25 When I read about this battle I wondered why French fishermen were prevented from fishing when other countries could continue to fish depleted stocks. I expected British Twitter outrage. I’m pleased to find your arguments being aired.
344 2018-08-29 21:12:05 @TheBrain agreed. TLRY set new standards (for good or bad) in all stocks. Trying not to hate for not buying that one. My DD steered me clear

347 2018-08-29 21:11:13 Folks lost their cool with Coinbase but there were several reasons for that. If we want to be taken seriously, need to be compliant. Corporate coins in my opinion need to be with stocks and commodities. Open source coin is different as all profit is going to coin price increase.

354 2018-08-29 21:07:07 If those British fisherman today think they’re some kind of heroes then they can feck off. As can Gove. France bans fishing in that area to protect stocks. UK has historically respected that. This is <50 people across 5 boats. People need to get a grip, and a sense of proportion

387 2018-08-29 20:59:42 It may not even be a ‘tax payer’ cash flow issue, with the NHS requesting that suppliers hold larger contingency stocks.  Endless disinformation spread by both Remainers and Brexiteers.... can’t help thinking it was precisely this that got us here :-(
388 2018-08-29 20:58:55 when my stocks go down i already know trump was on twitter 
389 2018-08-29 20:58:40 Funny how after attacking Google and Amazon today, both of their stocks have jumped up. It’s almost like nobody is listening to a word you’re saying.

Resign.
390 2018-08-29 20:57:29 If you have money in stocks, GTFO now. Stocks, and the economy, don't run on "productivity numbers" they run on human sentiment. If people think things are bad they sell, and stop buying, this makes stocks go down regardless. Right now people think things are bad.

392 2018-08-29 20:55:45 @CNBCClosingBell @Cbob200 @michaelsantoli Just a note: According to @williamoneilco (Investor's Business Daily) if one bought stocks being overly concerned w/ P:E Ratios & being "too expensive", YOU WOULD'VE MISSED EVERY HUGE STOCK MARKET WINNER OVER THE PAST 100 YEARS!

397 2018-08-29 20:53:27 Why? To buy pounds that will fall further? Money loss.
To buy a property in London? The market price is overrated and british credit capability is too low.
To buy stocks? Stock price is calculated in $ and the £ price takes that into account.
398 2018-08-29 20:52:51 OHLC bar charts, which i prefer over HLC charts, reveal the same info as candles, just not as obvious. Candles r 4 people who place importance on open and close, whereas bars r for people who value the hi and lo. I prefer bars b/c candles contain too much info 4 my taste #stocks

403 2018-08-29 20:49:07 Hi Kieran, most of the Funko POPs that we sell are limited edition and only whilst stocks last but if you let me know which one you are looking for I can check this for you. :) Kind regards - Calum.

405 2018-08-29 20:47:48 Corrections are temporary. Thus, if I buy and hold mainstream stocks (no “hold your breath” stocks), all prices will eventually return to near previous highs or above. Essentially, I buy companies, not stocks. A solid company, especially a decent dividend payer, will recover.
406 2018-08-29 20:47:28 What other tech stocks pay you to own them? 

I’m considering $EQIX, $AAPL, $GRMN, $INTC, $MSFT, $QCOM, $TXN, $WDC
407 2018-08-29 20:46:35 Good job Ernie, what would we do without you, thank you! But I hope the person who punished you for doing good, gets far greater punishment from the courts! Time for stocks to be brought back so we could throw rotten, smellie, fruit n veg as well but that’s just my view!

420 2018-08-29 20:40:45 Stocks and implied volatility move in the opposite direction about 80 percent of the time, but the VIX crept higher in the second half of January even as the S&P 500 hit record highs. That’s happening again
421 2018-08-29 20:40:12 Not unprecedented or unreasonable, given during the several ‘Cod Wars’ of the ‘50’s-‘70’s, we sent warships to intercept Icelandic trawlers that were encroaching on our territorial waters & looting fish stocks. So, cool your jets, and consider how context might be imprtnt. here.

425 2018-08-29 20:38:52 ...so w/ a hanging man, there is a period during the day in which price is dominated by sellers. W/ a trend day, that period of seller domination isn't there. It was only when i began daytrading the S&P w/ candles (I prefer bars now) did i gain an appreciation 4 the h.m. #stocks

428 2018-08-29 20:37:19 My father worked long hours in a factory his whole life. Stocks in the company were part of his benefits, and he was able to buy a little more. Now ready to sell them, worth triple their starting value.
429 2018-08-29 20:37:10 TLRY is just minutes from my house, and I really can’t believe they are valued at 5.78 Billion!!

There will be more to be made on pot stocks when they crash, versus this crazy move up

431 2018-08-29 20:36:30 indices not indicative of the state of the individual stocks
432 2018-08-29 20:36:07 Sure stocks are going up, but at what cost?  Take the manufacturing sector for instance.  When the river catches fire in Cleveland again, call the EPA.  Oh wait, there won’t be one then.  It’s easy to make things good in the short term, but you gotta think long haul.
433 2018-08-29 20:35:31 As far as the stocks go there's a lot of people that don't understand and rely totally on the brokers they were ripping people off they invested in stocks that gave them the highest fees instead of what was best for the client and charging fees for everything

438 2018-08-29 20:33:30 The MSM (particularly TV) is full of people who make good money, have big homes in affluent suburbs, own stocks, send their kids to good schools etc. All of this makes them resistant to a move left. They may claim to be liberal but they really are Republican-lite.

440 2018-08-29 20:30:40 Without the EU quotas our fishing industry would be dead by now. They halted over fishing and enabled fishing stocks to return. 

Over fishing will return and prices will drop and stocks will deplete. 

If you ever turned up to the commissions you were on Nigel, you’d know this.
441 2018-08-29 20:30:09 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $TIF, $BWA, $WDC, $KSS, and $APTV.
442 2018-08-29 20:29:59 Sure you do. You understand nothing about sustainability & fish migration. Nothing about non fishing areas, wrong size mesh, wrong size line, breeding seasons or having to share stocks. Nothing about longevity of the industry nor that CFP saving Cod & Haddocks thanks to the EU.
443 2018-08-29 20:29:46 I heard my favorite company @BoxHQ was down a few points today. So I bought more stocks.

Fantastic mate!

Nice juicy numbers there #WDC

Bring on the trolls until they aren't seen anymore. happens with many of my stocks, I just ignore.
453 2018-08-29 20:26:27 "Stacking this money, investing in stocks"
454 2018-08-29 20:26:00 I admittly rather trade with leverage in other ways, options does seem like borderline gambling at times.

It can be worth managing if you think you know what you're doing but it's probably best to get your feet wet with regular stocks first.

458 2018-08-29 20:25:10 Stocks usually do well into this weekend and then dip
459 2018-08-29 20:25:09 some of them are who has alot of stocks in your light companies too. which they make them go up when they want & it's not due to more usage. but because they want to make it hard on you & get you under their control. just like your gas does too.
460 2018-08-29 20:24:22 all of that suffering for nothing. this is why iqiyi's stocks have tumbled and deservedly so!!!
461 2018-08-29 20:23:10 Ha ha no I was only joking. It's about researching stocks, for me under £10m mcap and identifying good assets / manegment, news flow and making sure the sp hasn't risen strongly already.

My response to everything this week.
463 2018-08-29 20:22:57 Like this if you want me to stream live what I think can be the next IGC a couple of cannabis stocks or something similar.
464 2018-08-29 20:22:55 Is this actually a thing, gonna buy supervalus crisp stocks
465 2018-08-29 20:22:50 0.48% GDP.  I think only 12,000 fishermen directly.  Also, periodically fish stocks move around... So we could have a fist full of nothing.
466 2018-08-29 20:22:33 Kinda like holding onto volatile growth stocks.  You ride up and get $$. But soon the $$ride gets too unreliable and you sell before the stock falls way down.
467 2018-08-29 20:21:03 It's pretty hilarious that #CNBC and #Bloomberg have just discovered that #cannabis stocks exist and have high valuations. $ACB $FIRE $WEED $APH $CRON $CHOO $TLRY $MJ

471 2018-08-29 20:20:25 tbh options seem like one of the cheaper ways of making profit on some out-of-price stocks, e.g. Amazon trading for $2,000 is a lot for a single stock vs optioning it when you know how, so I've been learning that with vertical spread stuff to limit max profit & max risk
472 2018-08-29 20:20:18 everyone's fomoing into stocks now
473 2018-08-29 20:19:58 Pot stocks are the new bitcoin

The money bin alone is only souvenir cash and doesn't represent the bank accounts, stocks and shares and properties Scrooge owns worldwide, not to mention a gold moon.
481 2018-08-29 20:14:40 World stocks generally higher: US +.6%; Europe +.3%. Trade euphoria again dominated markets. Progress with Canada hinted while China still unsure. Solid 2Q earnings & GDP likely to mitigate any trade disappointments. Only Trump can derail markets & looking less likely.

490 2018-08-29 20:09:44 When they buy stocks they are giving cash to the company that they are investing. That money can go to increase equity share which is good for anyone who have stocks, for example your IRA or 401K or reinvested in the company.
491 2018-08-29 20:09:36 GDP was over 4% numerous times during Obama’s terms. I would explain the difference between a year and a quarter, but from experience I know you people are too dumb to wrap your heads around it. Stocks have been setting record highs since 2013. Job growth has slowed. I’m yawning.

521 2018-08-29 19:57:52 Any weed stocks Steve?
522 2018-08-29 19:57:26 To be entirely level with you... I don't do weed stocks. I don't do stocks at all. I'd much rather support small independent growers and businesses regardless of their place on the legal spectrum. I disagree with the cannabis monopoly.
523 2018-08-29 19:57:22 Hey America! Invest in Canadian cannabis stocks. Bring it global and ram it down the US’s throat.
524 2018-08-29 19:57:11 I've gotten jack & shit. Plus, why do they put the stockmarket on the news? Like less than 20% of Americans have stocks. I could give two shits about that

607 2018-08-29 19:23:48 Because stocks have strong positive drift, the US economy is a beast, and betting on its stocks is betting on worldwide growth. Test a strategy that goes long when S&P 500 goes below 200 DMA, and contrast it with a strategy that goes short when  it goes above the 200 DMA.

613 2018-08-29 19:21:54 This doesn't really bother me. With traditional stocks, there are plenty of funds that focus on certain "categories" of investments. If these folks want to invest in a mined crypto fund and destroy the environment, that's on them! #xrpthestandard
614 2018-08-29 19:21:40 Not really related to the broader economy but more a comment on the markets. Fundamentals are a suggestion as equity markets reflect artificially inflated values. Perhaps as a result of repurchases? The multiples at which some stocks are trading are comical.

626 2018-08-29 19:16:45 High flying stocks like AMZN (formerly NFLX until it busted recently) tend to double in less than 12 months near the end of bull markets.  It's common.  I remember 1999 vividly.  Feels a lot like that in FANG.  In Dow, feels more like 2000.

657 2018-08-29 19:03:35 It’s strange how all of a sudden this war, that’s been going on for 10 years, is about Brexit! It’s not! More importantly has anyone stopped to think of the damage we are collectively causing from over fishing ALL waters and depleting fish stocks at a scary rate?
658 2018-08-29 19:03:18 Stock piling is not gonna work... Stocks will run out and then what? And what about other things like food, gas, petroleum... No deal may mean the UK going back to the dark ages.

756 2018-08-29 18:22:44 I once read an article that suggested that the stock market was effectively deflationary. Rather, the value of stocks were not included in the money supply.

I wonder what the effect of ownership of money is on overall prices...
757 2018-08-29 18:21:55 @BernieSanders do you know how business works or did you get stuck in the Middle Ages? CEOs paid from stocks do NOT make their $ direct from low workers. The stock market 1% pays them. The market wouldn’t rise if the profit declined. #repercussions #idiots #Bernie
758 2018-08-29 18:21:53 You probably think your advice is safe, reliable. But you have nothing to base your Bitcoin target on, nothing. As for your lemming US stocks idea, that market is massively over cooked by any valuation method. And you inwardly know it but have to keep the balls in the air...
759 2018-08-29 18:21:34 Law or no law, if the French don't fish there, in order to allow stocks to replenish, then neither should we! Doing so IS taking advantage. If it was the other way around, we would be livid too. There are laws, common sense, and decency, unfortunately they don't always coincide.

765 2018-08-29 18:18:06 That's how I see it! If the French don't fish there, to allow stocks to replenish, then neither should we, law or no law.
766 2018-08-29 18:18:00 I think the stocks will go upas long as the interest rates will be low. Meawhile will bitcoin be in a cumulative phase. But many pensions funds need money, and will soon or later enter the crypto market making a boom. Of course the ones who will chose alts that will go up 10x
767 2018-08-29 18:17:41 Think twice before panic selling when stocks drop sharply based on weak EPS as a result of rising steel prices. COGS may have increased from Trump tariffs, but in a quarter or two, many companies may adjust by being able to pass costs on to customers.

782 2018-08-29 18:13:12 tRump counts on the churches to feed people without jobs or food.. That’s not welfare , the state should be caring for that and sick people don’t have money because of the Ripped obamacare 
 No jobs created by tax cuts . Money spent on buying stocks instead ..Vote him away #vote
783 2018-08-29 18:13:09 By strong business investment you must mean purchasing their own stocks.
784 2018-08-29 18:12:53 Growth are more important than profitability for investors. Stagnant wages stifles aggregate demand growth and increases savings in cash, stocks, realestate. Then lack of consumption growth leads to fewer domestic investment opportunities, less investments and more specualtion.
785 2018-08-29 18:12:13 what happened, happened.. The future doesn’t change the past!

I think you need to find yourself a few chill pills and dose heavily!
786 2018-08-29 18:11:36 Mychal Kendricks charged with insider trading, and I just want someone to tell me what stocks to invest in
787 2018-08-29 18:11:34 dear MP, do you understand sustainable stocks? #c4news
788 2018-08-29 18:11:30 Interesting to see such a major divergence in #FANG stocks. $AMZN nearing $2,000, $GOOGL surging in spite of the Trump attacks, $AAPL a monster, up every day....and poor $FB and $NFLX can't catch a bid. First time in a LONG time it has been like that.
789 2018-08-29 18:11:21 Can’t sell stocks now.
790 2018-08-29 18:11:15 I majored in business management and understand quite well companies P&L. Major companies are pocketing profits and buying back their stocks. This is one reason the DOW has inflated numbers. If you would like to debate then do so however your insults fall on deaf ears.
791 2018-08-29 18:11:14 what sort of customer service are you guys providing, what is the seller's cancellation policy. contact the seller and ask them to send me the device if not now , then later when they have proper stocks, I dont want to shell extra 1000rs in the next sale.
792 2018-08-29 18:11:03 so much wrong with this — #Brexit v. #EU, historical rivalries, geography etc. — but the real problem, of course, is that there are too few scallops and too many f—ing imbeciles, from both countries, who are hidebound determined to wipe out the stocks for everyone. That is all.
793 2018-08-29 18:10:26 Why is it legal to fish for scallops at this time of year if it’s harmful for scallop stocks in the short and long term? #C4news
794 2018-08-29 18:10:22 In theory it’s just paying for information about a change in policy or a new product that will later affect the stock market and buying and selling stocks based on that information!
795 2018-08-29 18:10:13 US stocks? Before or after the stock market crashes?
796 2018-08-29 18:10:01 finalprofitt Stocks alerts signals hight profits. #Stocks #Commodities (#courses #forex #indicator #MACD)
797 2018-08-29 18:09:21 It's been decimated, just like the fish stocks would if there hadn't been EU intervention.
798 2018-08-29 18:08:07 That’s great. Can we see if it’s sustainable before we cheer too much? Also, GDP is almost not necessarily a great number at this point for measuring growth, ( same with stocks) and it’s probably affected by the tariff fears . So let’s see what the future holds.
799 2018-08-29 18:07:24 So i’m probably getting the Pearl and Marina amiibo this week. I have to wait till my local game stop stocks them again.

They’ll text me when it happens
800 2018-08-29 18:06:54 Now that I downloaded this stock broker app I’m going to start acting like I know stocks
801 2018-08-29 18:05:36 Also the French want to operate a closed season (and don't fish till October 1st) to preserve stocks. Surely thats a good thing? We should come to some deal.
802 2018-08-29 18:05:28 Alcohol is a bigger threat. We wouldn’t have a deficit if cannabis were legal nationwide. Look at the Canadian markets-pot stocks are about to really take off 
803 2018-08-29 18:04:33 What are some of the last stocks you purchased?
804 2018-08-29 18:04:08 Just donated my 10th pint of blood  I started late but trying to catch up.. stocks are low so go and donate please 
805 2018-08-29 18:03:55 With $AMZN up so much I wonder if stocks like $KBSF will benefit. Currently lagging
806 2018-08-29 18:03:54 Sally Keeble is the first speaker, speaking passionately about Northampton and the fact that it has one of the biggest housing stocks that will be diluted across the larger council
807 2018-08-29 18:03:33 The french government limits the season to ensure that stocks are not exhausted. EU quotas don't cover scallops so it's the french government's way of trying to ensure that the area isn't overfished. Shame the UK government don't give a stuff really...
808 2018-08-29 18:02:25 what exact stocks will be added?
809 2018-08-29 18:01:59 A lot of stocks are screaming sells / shorts here.
810 2018-08-29 18:01:48 Yo! These #cannabisindustry #stocks are High AF! 
(YES I AM AWARE OF THE PUN!) 

811 2018-08-29 18:01:08 which exact stocks will be added?
812 2018-08-29 18:00:49 The ignorant Protestants and the ignorant Catholics are the only people who worship stocks and stones, for the former think a dead stick diabolic and the latter holy.
813 2018-08-29 18:00:35 Sell and go short all pot stocks.

821 2018-08-29 17:58:24 What were the stocks wearing? Maybe the stocks shouldn't have been there. What can we teach stocks about how to behave so they don't invite being insider traded?

#SeeHowStupidThatSounds
822 2018-08-29 17:58:20 $SQ is the reason I still like stocks even though crypto can give faster gains. The growth on Square is amazing, I’m expecting it to break over $100 by January!
823 2018-08-29 17:58:10 Definitely not cheap. Personally, I'm feeling very "stuck in the middle" lately ... not predicting an imminent decline or crash, but not nearly as raging bullish as I had been in recent years. It's gotten hard to find new undervalued stocks so I'm just growing existing positions.
824 2018-08-29 17:58:05 Hey, go easy on him! I’m buying some stocks soon and wouldn’t mind Tesla’s worth dropping off a clif first.

830 2018-08-29 17:55:13 $WMT isn't "just" retail.  That's why.  They are in the middle of a massive pivot.  So WMT & AMZN would be outside of what I'd call "retail" stocks.
831 2018-08-29 17:55:13 I need source info here. Usually both sides come to an agreement as to when fishing should start. Because otherwise the British fish all the scollops before the French can start? if it's about preserving stocks that makes sense? when and why did talks break donw this year?
832 2018-08-29 17:54:57 @RepDonBacon You realize the irony of the comparison right? In the 90s we were all delusional and tech stocks crashed hard...not sure this is great support for your strong economy argument.
833 2018-08-29 17:54:23 I need to learn how to trade stocks.
834 2018-08-29 17:53:17 I can only say my situation and others I have conversed with. Retirement is soaring, stocks are soaring, economy is soaring, tax cut will be covered by the spending and investments. Pretty simple stuff.
835 2018-08-29 17:52:57 are they promoting pot stocks? buzzfeed makes me sick with ALL their content 
836 2018-08-29 17:52:44 Reuters: POLL-US #natgas stocks seen up 64 bcf in week ended Aug. 24. This compared to 32 bcf BUILD same week last year; 5-year ave of 59 bcf BUILD. Note: POLL is survey of natural gas analysts' EIA storage estimates.
837 2018-08-29 17:51:42 Legalize Cannabis! Watch the markets skyrocket. Are you seeing Canada's pot stocks? Jobs, growth, money & more. . .
838 2018-08-29 17:51:23 I see...  The #MAGA stocks
839 2018-08-29 17:50:45 I bet the next #HardKnocks has something from Nassib about which stocks Kendrick should have picked instead. Lol

Are you watching Canadian pot stocks??????
841 2018-08-29 17:50:27 Excluding Financials from EV/EBIT Deep Value strategy is necessary, no doubt. I’ve found out that excluding stocks domiciled in CHN / developing countries - improves returns as well. Ispiration: Walter Schloss.
842 2018-08-29 17:49:28 We need our own network...or we need to all stay off for a week and watch their stocks
843 2018-08-29 17:49:14 My advice to younger people (-22): Educate yourself and invest in stocks. You’ll thank me later
844 2018-08-29 17:48:29 When was the last time you pulled 500% returns multiple days in a row trading u.s stocks?
845 2018-08-29 17:48:25 Might as well resort to the darts and blindfold method for picking stocks.
846 2018-08-29 17:47:42 I went less than 10% because the percentage of the population that owns stocks is so low. If the question is, what percentage of the population that owns stocks participated- then its probably over 60.
847 2018-08-29 17:47:06 I’m a senior banker and I know them as well. In fact, I’m very well networked, which is why I know most of the Engro top team. Furthermore, I am pretty angry over a lot of money that I lost in Engro stocks & bonds back in 2012 when the company almost sank.

863 2018-08-29 17:36:33 Glad you crushed it. It was a historic move in vol. As a day trade in FX (not just sitting long JPY and not touching it for two months), I felt it was awful. Forced my hand to trade stocks more seriously vs fx and it paid off big time.

865 2018-08-29 17:36:20 Imagine being able to afford stocks when the majority of the working class is more focused on paying their rent or bills just to scrape by while others defend a guy who wants to build a robot dragon and open a fucking Willy Wonka factory.
866 2018-08-29 17:35:52 Why are global #equity markets rallying? A fresh, creeping narrative about a less aggressive @federalreserve in 2019. Fed Funds Futures agree & the gap between those market prices & Fed guidance is large. If you are looking for a year-end melt up narrative for #stocks this is it.
867 2018-08-29 17:35:31 It is still wrong. Ducks provide nutrition for fish, yes, so under certain conditions fish stocks rise. But if pollution leads to de-oxygenation of the water then the fish stocks dwindle, regardless of what the ducks are doing. Fish DO NOT oxygenate the water.

877 2018-08-29 17:32:10 Your scenario is possible perhaps, but I think it’s unlikely. USTs are gonna get bid by ROW in the event of a meltdown.

And the sovereign debt bubble is worse in Europe and Japan than the US. Unless you’re saying they all sell-off simultaneously and stocks soar? I don’t see that

885 2018-08-29 17:29:45 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr It's my belief the SEC needs to reinstate the uptick rule and possibly enact a downtick rule.  The bubbles in certain stocks created by algos would be slowed down if these two rules were in place and also prevent short sellers from hammering them!
886 2018-08-29 17:29:39 I think the extreme summer time  low Volitility is exasperating moves to the upside. You’ve gone up a lot on very low volume. Low volume  in itself can create Big moves in stocks and it has.This will change  as volume picks up a lot in September

901 2018-08-29 17:22:59 It's not right to compare the nifty P/E of 2008 levels with 2018. The constituents have changed, from capex heavy / cyclical stocks to consumer and financial services heavy. These sectors always had a higher P/E. 

Studying stats without the complete picture is always fatal.

913 2018-08-29 17:18:17 Sembra corretto. Se due stocks separati e uno è il 130% dell'altro si può fare deficit un po' superiore al pil, se questo aumenta, senza aumentare rapporto deficit pil.
914 2018-08-29 17:18:15 so what your're saying is your buying #bitcoin and selling stocks

917 2018-08-29 17:17:20 The French are not fishing for scallops at the moment and trying to conserve stocks for the future, we are walking all over their common sense. What kind of county have we become?
918 2018-08-29 17:17:16 It baffles me to see die-hard MAGA African American males, because they’re literally the laughing stocks of their own political party and ideals and are too whitewashed to see it
919 2018-08-29 17:17:14 Also in USA not to mention baby boomers all retiring and going into bonds/cash. Stocks are due to get crushed from all metrics.
920 2018-08-29 17:17:11 If you have trouble imagining a 20% loss in the stock market, you shouldn't be in stocks
921 2018-08-29 17:17:06 I think we’ve been doing it for years under an agreement to fish limited days during the spawning season when the French don’t fish at all to preserve stocks. This year no agreement on days was reached.
922 2018-08-29 17:16:37 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD
923 2018-08-29 17:16:08 Yes. We always here those 7% stocks from experts. If we question why 90% stocks correct 80-90% they will bring in patriotism, pride, our potential, growth story and confuse you to the hell.
924 2018-08-29 17:16:03 $FUSZ $CELZ $SGDH $QMKR down to holding only these micros. Will continue to look for mid/long values. Finding some good undervalued stocks in the bigger exchanges seems easier right now. $FUSZ $CELZ my fav/others to build. Will keep posted. GLTA!

933 2018-08-29 17:14:02 it's what happened before when our fishermen depleted stocks and tried fishing in Icelandic waters instead. That didn't end too well for us, did it? Why are some of our fishermen so CLUELESS?

943 2018-08-29 17:11:23 My concern is that our fishermen are so stupid they can't see the reason why the French are conserving stocks for the future. You must be able to see that, surely?Like many others, I'm with the French on this.
944 2018-08-29 17:11:17 Between year end and mid year $emqq added 10 stocks to rules based index based #etf. Signs that IPO market in #emergingmarkets is healthy but also that ETFs are not static. @EricBalchunas #etfiq What’s inside matters.
945 2018-08-29 17:11:09 Sweet!   That’s a great strategy and @trickmitch1 teaches it very well!  The r/r on these can be amazing!  Taking a low risk, lower high set up with stop set just above HOD on stocks extended from VWAP are the afternoon set ups I look for too. Keep us posted man!

955 2018-08-29 17:08:38 @HalftimeReport EEM, namely Chinese stocks are preparing for a big buying opportunity. When it happens it should be pretty sharp, as longs re-load & shorts scurry to cover.  I just think the US stocks are getting far ahead at this point ahead of midterms, w/China, NK, other risks
956 2018-08-29 17:08:18 Point taken. And my point is that Livermore would be a buyer of new highs.

"Prices are never too high to begin buying or too low to begin selling. When I am buying, I must buy on a rising scale. I don’t buy long stocks on a scale down, I buy on a scale up."
957 2018-08-29 17:07:58 They are penny stocks pumpers. They are all just scammers themselves that's why they target the low hanging scams like #bcash and #ripple. They know it's easy to trick ignorant people into believing there going to get rich quick.

962 2018-08-29 17:06:38 My stagflation scenario probability has increased although still low. For the young ones, this is the worst case scenario. Absolute catastrophe in bonds and stocks.

977 2018-08-29 17:00:55 Note that the russell2k is up even more than the SPX. That implies a broadly successful corporate sector. This isn't a '10 stocks' sort of market. Which is bullish.

1001 2018-08-29 16:50:15 It's been a nice two- to three-week run for many growth stocks. Wouldn't be surprising to see some rest, and some later-stage ones are looking extended on a longer-term basis. Still, most look fine, with a bunch having emerged from bases just during the past month.

1014 2018-08-29 16:44:30 There are two seasonal factors I pay attention to. 1) The tendency for price to advance ahead of a holiday, e.g. Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and 2) The tendency for the mkt to perform better from Nov-Apr, w/ weakness often in Sept/Oct #stocks
1015 2018-08-29 16:44:15 Or possibly time for the EU to introduce quotas? Problem with the dredging method is that the Cornish and Scottish boats were only just outside french waters & could easily dredge scallops from them. The french introduced the limits on scallop fishing to conserve stocks.
1016 2018-08-29 16:44:10 British (including Scottish) have an appalling short termist record of how they treat fisheries. If it weren’t for the EU, Cod stocks would be dead.

1035 2018-08-29 16:38:16 Watching financial TV and I feel like Ive traveled back in time to 1999/2000. Seeing stocks up 30-40% in a few months (or less), companies losing money, no one reporting GAAP numbers (HOW HAS THIS LESSON BEEN FORGOTTEN?). It's not as insane as 20yrs ago, but it sure is similar.

1043 2018-08-29 16:36:21 S&amp;P futures flat as investors sit on their hands with Stocks near record highs.
1044 2018-08-29 16:35:56 I have few stocks... Can you check their TA.
1045 2018-08-29 16:34:41 Numbers??? GDP growth? Took Trump LESS than 2yrs to get a GDP growth of 4.1 AND history-making high stocks? Whatda ya got for Obomb's numbers on GDP growth in his entire 8 yrs? Does he even come close to 4.1? History making stocks? (tip my hat) & a Paul Harvey " good day " !
1046 2018-08-29 16:33:16 Don’t stereotype everything.  There is good n bad just like Herbalife still exists in stocks 
1047 2018-08-29 16:33:05 Cannabis Stocks have been moving positive for the past couple days.

1051 2018-08-29 16:31:02 Looks like we were breaching an understanding re conservation period for scallop stocks that the French had to abide by. No wonder they were incensed. Imagine it the other way round!
1052 2018-08-29 16:30:53 @MychalKendricks hey I’m looking to invest in some stocks, any suggestions?

1063 2018-08-29 16:26:03 You love questionable/controversial tech stocks!
1064 2018-08-29 16:25:40 Yet wages are complete dead and stagnant. Plenty of money for corporations and the tiny slice of Americans that own stocks.
1065 2018-08-29 16:25:05 After stocks have moved 50-60% in 18 months, no point gunning for the next 10%!

Waiting for a correction or a long consolidation will improve risk/reward ratio. 

If you have missed the big rally u don't have any cushion too!
1066 2018-08-29 16:24:56 Cannabis stocks are on fire this week! #stocks #options #trading
1067 2018-08-29 16:24:53 No, they are not owned by the public. Publicly traded stocks are not... you know what, nevermind. You're not going to listen or do the research anyway. Continue on with your ignorance.
1068 2018-08-29 16:24:29 Stop pestering me, it's not about what we sell, it's about how much they get themselves, imaging if they couldn't get it at all. The prices would soar. The EU finished their stocks because of greed. They need the British waters. Comprende?
1069 2018-08-29 16:24:23 So the Brits aren’t in any way concerned about fishing during the spawning season, which seems to be what the French are complaining about, because they’re not allowed to fish in order to protect stocks.
1070 2018-08-29 16:24:08 Indeed, hope is we never do because then everyone will realise the con: even cheaper money used to buy back stocks & push prices higher, do Mergers and Acquisitions, and transfer wealth from those it was meant to benefit, to those who created the problem in the first place
1071 2018-08-29 16:23:56 Wasn't there years of over fishing, actually threatening long term stocks of some fish, like cod? Surely the need to control that has also affected the fishing industry.
@IainDale @LBC
1072 2018-08-29 16:23:48 Mychal Kendricks simply had a scout team to helping get ready to pick stocks. Not a problem imo
1073 2018-08-29 16:23:32 Just buy some pot stocks

1089 2018-08-29 16:17:18 @IainDale - Hello Ian.  Your colleague Peter Allen said that until now British fishermen had, for 15 yrs, honored the arrangement (that French counterparts are compelled to do) not to fish for scallops before Oct. to allow stocks to mature. Do you know why we suddenly stopped?
1090 2018-08-29 16:17:10 The point here is it has absolutely nothing to do with stocks.

1110 2018-08-29 16:10:46 The massive run MJ stocks had from Oct ‘17 through Jan ‘18, followed by these consolidations (in various shapes and sizes), and then a subsequent rally...has been beautiful to watch on Long Term charts.
1111 2018-08-29 16:10:43 Sometimes it's a politican making a law and proceeding to tell a friend to sell the stocks because the company is going to lose a lot of money due to regulatory changes.

1125 2018-08-29 16:04:41 any thoughts if bankers are forcing people into equities as they bail on stocks? Why so many offering free trading? The PR campaign to the naive (dumb $) about stocks to the moon is also off the charts. I saw crazy season in 87,00,08. CB have their paws on this too.

1135 2018-08-29 16:03:01 Right now we are in a phase which requires one to sit tight and not think too much. The stocks are in a relentless rally and you better let them do the work for you. Do not interfere until there are clear signs such as 10d MA violations and so on.

1139 2018-08-29 16:01:13 Agreed. Easy money makes this a difficult proposition. And, even after the money runs out, zoombie stocks can stay around for a long time.
1140 2018-08-29 16:00:41 If you r speculator or gambler it's OK to continue to trade.. if you r smart investor check out from market and put money in fixed income which is giving risk free return of 8-9%..at some stage you will get astonishingly low value stocks to get in.. Never ever chase market
1141 2018-08-29 16:00:33 I saw that too and it is disgusting. All sport fishing should be banned given the decline of salmon and other fishery stocks. And those people need to be located and arrested.
1142 2018-08-29 15:59:31 Ha.. I guess history books will be able to write, Trump had a GDP growth of 4.1 in LESS that 2yrs! Not to mention, history-making high stocks!    (Scratchin my head) did Obomb in 8yrs EVER get above 2.5? hmmm NOPE!!
1143 2018-08-29 15:58:40 While fishing in the area is technically legal, it seems the French fishers are interested in ensuring sustainable stocks hence their self-imposed closure. Is this not sensible @LukePollard?

1157 2018-08-29 15:53:02 No it is not! All you talk about is GDP, and stocks and other money matters( that affect the rich) but the very heart of this country is gone(broken). “What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul “#liarinchief

1160 2018-08-29 15:51:54 Actually, a lot of Americans own stocks with their 401k snd IRA retirement plans. Many older Americans suffered when the market crashed thanks to Bush. Still, I would be willing to get rid of Trump.
1161 2018-08-29 15:51:53 If he owns any stocks at all, he benefits from a rising economy. I believe I’ve already tried to explain this to you. Only nosey pervs want to see his tax returns. You don’t have that right. Again, supposition. Your arguments are childish and disingenuous.

1166 2018-08-29 15:51:09 When the recession comes, stocks are going to fall a lot more than 20% from a CAPE of 34 unless dramatic FED intervention occurs almost immediately shooting both barrels. Adding even more debt for the coming reset.
1167 2018-08-29 15:51:09 For the record, my 457b I had at the beginning of the year is up 5.89% and my 457b at my new job (started in May) is up 5.4%, and I'm invested very aggressively! My allocation to International stocks has been a drag on returns this year

Others seem to get a nod or follow their trusted or otherwise friends! Plenty buy stocks where they barely know little more than the ticker

You did indeed post a good positive summary, thank you

I wish you a great evening

1180 2018-08-29 15:47:42 Look...I don't trade equities, I just have long term investments in the market. I want VOLATILITY in the markets. And in the FX market the best way to "stoke" volatility is to see it in equities first. This insatiable grind higher in stocks makes life in the FX tough.  #forex

1186 2018-08-29 15:46:04 The only thing that will stop these creeps from continuing their leftist strategy of control is a mass exodus from every platform. They can't survive a mass exodus. Advertisers would leave, stocks would go down.

1188 2018-08-29 15:45:55 Haha. The growth slowed down a lot this past year, hence my sarcastic post. But crypto can be a gold mine if you have a good pack to put in it. Coming from a world of stocks and bonds, trading currencies is a big first for me. Especially letting the money sleep for so long.

1207 2018-08-29 15:39:28 Stocks rallying. Megacap and Nazzie leading the charge so far. Almost exclusively a high beta rally. 

Going to use this pop as an opportunistic entry point for QQQ puts.

1210 2018-08-29 15:37:59 How bad have things gotten exactly? Economy is doing wonderful. Vast majority of economists(nonbias) credit that to Trump (reducing reg, tax breaks,etc)
Companies like Apple and many more are creating thousands of jobs. Stocks hit record high after the new trade deal with Mexico
1211 2018-08-29 15:37:55 BTW I am NOT pointing this out because I think it makes sense to "short" the #COMPQ. Only that I would MUCH rather recommend "Safe Money" style stocks and a higher allocation to cash than recommend people chase #techmania stocks into the teeth of a manic move like this
1212 2018-08-29 15:37:49 Before whomever starts spreading hate towards me. I don't know Mr.Trump but whatever he is doing is working because so much hate is focused towards the man.

1215 2018-08-29 15:37:42 You mean their stocks look more robust because they have been buying them back and then outsourcing jobs even though they said with the tax breaks they would do the opposite?
1216 2018-08-29 15:37:30 Maybe they decided to invest after the stocks dipped so low for some "unknown" reason...
1217 2018-08-29 15:37:27 to be fair, $1000 would be the definition of blood in the streets putting everyone under water from even as far back as 2016.

1240 2018-08-29 15:32:49 oh not again another 30% gain on stocks and loss in commodities......
1241 2018-08-29 15:32:44 You didn't answer. Most bears have been bearish for 10 years. Market is up 3x-4x since then. That is no crypto, there's real money behind it, and cash flows backing it up, stocks are not going to crash 80%. The economy is solid af.  Once it turns, then turn short, not before.
1242 2018-08-29 15:32:09 Stocks are up

1244 2018-08-29 15:31:45 A word on the #PetroYuan. Last year I offered the view that if it was indeed going to involve physical gold settlement that we should see the effects before it comes on line as folks would front run a systemic squeeze on physical stocks. Pt 1
1245 2018-08-29 15:31:29 You’re speaking as Luke Gromen, not a fund. 

Not sure they have the ability to just swap risk-free bonds for stocks at ATH valuations. 

Plus Microsoft could get in half next downturn, or worse, while every developed county is going to default or inflate their debt??
1246 2018-08-29 15:31:20 It's certainly price inflation, though IMO consumer goods inflation is probably still the most important (if flawed) metric, in the final analysis. I run a measure called Broad Price inflation which is CPI, PPI, stocks, houses, and RGDP-adjusted money supply. Also a useful gauge.
1247 2018-08-29 15:29:58 From a trading point of few one wants to see that. A blow off top. Yeah, it's painful but this is the world of short selling penny stocks. $MDXG
1248 2018-08-29 15:29:38 You are right and you should say it. Nothing more bizarre than seeing middle class people thinking of buying stocks so they can cheer up a billionaire who said he has been feeling down lately 
1249 2018-08-29 15:28:53 Neither. It is comparative inventory = current stocks (crude + select refined products) - 5-year avg (crude + select refined products).

1252 2018-08-29 15:28:02 In a similar vein, as a value style investor I find I tend to both buy and sell stocks too early. My idea would be to ask my broker to wait and buy or sell 3 months after they receive my instruction.

1264 2018-08-29 15:25:13 A word of clarification for any incorrectly informed: the Reign of God and the Good News of Jesus are not stocks whose value depends on popular support, subject to ups, downs, or plateaus. When the Church thinks in those terms, it has sold out and become about self-preservation.

1377 2018-08-29 14:51:37 Well, I’m not licensed in the UK. I’m in the US & the US considers growth stocks as stocks that are projecting to grow at a significant rate above the market. Hence the reason for the reinvesting and lack of divedend payments. The company reinvests in order to accelerate growth.

1408 2018-08-29 14:43:12 Well no. That’s not it. Part of the problem stems from disappointing housing data, rising interest rates, and limited inventory of affordable housing. Also these aren’t growth stocks. They pay dividends which growth stocks don’t typically do, since the companies reinvest earnings

1539 2018-08-29 14:06:29 excellent chart - we need to be teaching every American about how Index Funds and ETFs work as oppose to investing in specific, higher risk, individual stocks.

1545 2018-08-29 14:02:48 Sector-wise, gains in PSU Bank, metal and realty stocks were offset by weakness in IT, pharma and media shares. Sensex and Nifty ended 0.45% and 0.40% lower respectively.
1546 2018-08-29 14:02:13 Taking a close look at $BOX. Not normally a fan of stocks w/ negative earnings, but this one seems to have the support of the street. Approaching key support level after huge decline post-guidance.
1547 2018-08-29 14:01:39 One can earn 50% return in very short time even with low quality stocks....but growing pf with 20% cagr is very difficult...and only few people do this miracle....

1602 2018-08-29 13:43:57 First, 7.8% is far from a bad return for a year, especially since higher returns require higher risks. I'd always max out the free money from a company match. Additional investable funds can be put in an index fund and/or a few individual stocks via a Roth IRA. Hope that helps.

1609 2018-08-29 13:41:24 That's correct, the countries are borrowing at neg yields (getting paid to borrow) & the funds flow through CBs to buy assets including large-cap US stocks. CBs are the conduit for liquidity flow. The stakes they hold in large US companies is surprising to us.

1667 2018-08-29 13:19:58 Get used to it! Brexit means scenes like this tenfold. This is why you need international agreements on things like this. No point in one country putting a restriction in place if others then ignore it. And you have to listen to the scientists on stocks...
1668 2018-08-29 13:19:29 Nomi prins said that only 10% of americans own 84% of all stocks, so yeah, what you said sounds about right.

1679 2018-08-29 13:16:15 No compromise on myth, you mean? See "Sources" in other tweets for the truth of it:  replaced by tendentious propaganda by agitators for Brexit:

> Move to sustainable stocks
> Selling-off of licences to foreign corps
> Neglect by UK Govts (esp. Cameron's) & UKIP, not blamed EU
1680 2018-08-29 13:15:49 Agreed, I just woke up to your rudeness and felt I needed to. No more though! I voted for Bernie. But, have to recognize the direct effect on my stocks, way, way up. We feel it personally, so, he’s doing something others couldn’t. North Korea? The Olympics did it, not Trump.

1704 2018-08-29 13:07:26 Correct, but the sea is vast and full of fish that will take the bait. You might not know of any YouTubers but they are out there.

1715 2018-08-29 13:03:51 Great Tweet sir, and I thought I was the only one. After failing miserably in directional trades in a trading market, moving back to selling straddles in stocks. Hoping to master the art of managing trades someday. At least while selling options, we have statistics in our favor.
1716 2018-08-29 13:03:40 Also, how do we knew that he and his family aren’t shorting the stocks of companies he attacks?
1717 2018-08-29 13:01:53 This seems to be #bad advice. Now that American money is in on these stocks, the largest market in the world, take profits ???
1718 2018-08-29 13:01:32 Yes, and potentially damaging the stocks in a shared fishing area that the UK might not have access to after March.
1719 2018-08-29 13:01:08 The press is now the enemy of the people -- this is a simple answer for me. 
Look at the lies they've perpetrated in the past few years. 
Look back longer and you'll see a trail of lies. 
They think they control how we think, but they don't. 

Media stocks plunge.
1720 2018-08-29 13:01:05 Wouldn't it be grand if all the folks who thank Obama for this great GDP growth had been long U.S. stocks the past 2 years?
1721 2018-08-29 13:00:27 And that big ship ramming the smaller ones is British. Disgraceful, it shows they have no respect for the produce they farm, if it was not for the EU the UK stocks of fish would already be gone due to their short term greed.
1722 2018-08-29 13:00:06 Great stuff, well done! Which day(s) and at what time shall we send media to you, or is this a more informal ‘while stocks last’ affair?!

1724 2018-08-29 12:59:08 You said "stop growing corn". USDA estimates for '19 show stocks to use of 11%, (41 days of US corn supply). Stop, or severely lessen corn production and watch what happens.

And if farmers don't plant corn/soy, what would you propose happening on 200 million acres of farmland?

1743 2018-08-29 12:48:52 Not at all. Everyone should observe closed seasons implemented to preserve stocks. Open season in 5 weeks.
 
It's in everyone's interests.
1744 2018-08-29 12:48:42 Gun laws would be the first (and biggest) step.

Keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill, convicted felons, domestic abusers. Ban semi and full automatic weapons in whole. Ban bump stocks and other modifications. Offer a buyback program (like Australia) and destroy them.
1745 2018-08-29 12:48:23 Great effort by @IndiaPOCO ensuring sufficient stocks were available. 100000 nos are not small by  any means. Expecting similar stock availability in future to curb black marketing.

1747 2018-08-29 12:47:48 I’m over the “X% return since 2009” takes. 

No one bought FANG in March 2009 and is still holding today. 

No one was sitting in cash in 2008. 

A more likely scenario is you were holding stocks and sold them when you got back to even or maybe even for a loss. Don’t @ me.

1769 2018-08-29 12:35:21 My experience is more  lost buying and “holding” value than growth stocks. Important though to at least recoup initial capital on the growth ones so you can “punt the profit” IMO

1771 2018-08-29 12:34:59 That's very crazy, Japanese stock market rose roughly 0.5%.

A game sector rose but that is usual.
A retail sector didn't rise but the sector had risen since some years ago.
Individual stocks, MOL is very crazy, N-Shipbuilding is also crazy.
1772 2018-08-29 12:34:58 Will happen for sure, but we saw one yesterday and saw the stocks rally back all day, only to be up big again pre market... I don’t think the initial leg up is done, but yes pullback inevitable, just from where is the ?

1783 2018-08-29 12:26:08 I care! But Carl be serious, your viewing in intrinsically linked to performance of stocks. Bull mkt more viewers. Simple and undeniable.
1784 2018-08-29 12:26:05 I hear my grandad laugh in the living room I know he’s going to walk over to me and say something about politics, stocks, or sports... I love that mans
1785 2018-08-29 12:25:52 yes two consecutive good quarters indicate resumption of core sector activity. similar stocks who r posting good results are the blue eyed boys of market.

1788 2018-08-29 12:23:35 Cannbis stocks have been extremely hot lately there was a pull back yesterday then in ah and pm $CRON and $TLRY came out with good prs. So keep them on watch today but make sure your on the right side of momentum bc they can turn hard at any moment.
1789 2018-08-29 12:23:30 Just been reported on @bbc #WATO as the British/French ‘GOING TO WAR’ !  We are such a jingoistic nation.  Norway replenished cod stocks by selective non-fishing policy and French trying the same method.
1790 2018-08-29 12:23:19 Pot stocks rocking again, and this time I’m focusing in on small wins as these are all fairly over extended. $IGC for a pre-market scalp! In at 1.76, out at 1.90. It just hit 2 bucks, but I played it conservative cause pre-market can be unpredictable sometimes. Happy trading!
1791 2018-08-29 12:23:06 When you wanna work out but also need to keep an eye on your stocks. 
1792 2018-08-29 12:22:50 ... we are talking on new investments, not 15 years old stocks. Which country and which value you are worried about, then I will check.
1793 2018-08-29 12:22:47 Just a thought. Cancel the panto, and put Freddie, Shula, Alistair and Soosan in the stocks on the village green over Christmas. Bridge Farm to supply the veg in a final act of diversification. #thearchers

1795 2018-08-29 12:22:25 I would be interested in knowing how much of the net worth of the lower 99% is tied up in FAANG stocks (direct or through mutual funds). this administration is tough on google, amazon and facebook (have they picked a fight w/ netflix or apple yet?)

1800 2018-08-29 12:17:34 Seems like something cooking in PSU stocks. Not just banks. Major PSU stocks showing good strength
1801 2018-08-29 12:15:54 Tuck away long term investments like Nortel, Blackberry, Potash, Valeant, and now Canopy growth?  All TFSA does is improve compounding by saving taxes. You still have to buy and trade stocks sensibly. Definitely not in MFs where MERs reduce compounding.

1811 2018-08-29 12:12:06 Well, the top 10% own property, stocks, bonds etc, and they will see their net worth increase and with rates at zero or negative, they can borrow money at very low interest to take on more risk.

So it's scary for the average Joe, imho

1815 2018-08-29 12:10:41 Huh. French take action to try to preserve scallop stocks in the English Channel. UK fishermen steam in & fish anyway, so provoke the French. UK fishermen mostly voted for Brexit, so they'll not be allowed there soon anyway.

1818 2018-08-29 12:09:38  I’m no Trudeau fan but the notion that Trump is a master businessman is a joke.  His net worth would be higher now if he’d just taken daddy’s money and put it into safe stocks. Much of his wealth now comes from shady Russians paying 2-3x market value in cash.

1841 2018-08-29 11:56:08 And that also assumes zero growth. Reality is a stock like alphabet has been on a P/E of 20 for many years. Lack of accountability on those predicting doom is sad part of the market. Lots of overpriced stocks but also lots of losers who have totally missed the big picture

1915 2018-08-29 11:22:26 Profit does not directly correlate to company market cap. 2PM were already doing world tours and selling as much as Got7 did yet it didn't do anything for JYP's stocks. JYP began to rise the same time Twice explded in popularity, not when Got7 did. The main factor is prety clear.

1947 2018-08-29 10:59:54 This only applies for physically settled 46 stocks which are of highly speculative nature. Honestly this wont affect the big stable stocks. And in our opinion people should not be trading in those 46 stocks anyway :)
1948 2018-08-29 10:58:36 Yes because when Got7 debuted and became popular the JYP stocks rose too right? Oh wait, it didn't. But yeah they are the reason anyway because meninists.
1949 2018-08-29 10:56:14 2PM was already touring worldwide and earning as much as Got7 did. Did that do anything with the stocks? No. What makes you think Got7 tour heavily influenced the stocks? A clear undeniable factor here is JYP began to rise exactly the same time Twice began to rise. Its clear why.
1950 2018-08-29 10:55:28 2PM was already touring worldwide and earning as much as Got7 did. Did that do anything with the stocks? No. What makes you think Got7 tour heavily influenced the stocks? A clear undeniable factor here is JYP began to rise exactly the same time Twice began to rise. Its clear why.
1951 2018-08-29 10:55:24 I'm 57 and went back to college on the Post 9/11 GI Bill a few years ago. Tests in business school were all multiple choice and the students knew no economics, finance, stocks, accounting. They were just phoning it in. I mentioned Milton Friedman and nothing!
1952 2018-08-29 10:54:41 Robert Schiller said that buy only value stocks in an interview.
1953 2018-08-29 10:53:30 Yes yes, clearly Got7 was the reason JYP stocks exploded in popularity when Twice wasn't debut yet. Oh wait, it didnt.  JYP only started to rise at the same time Twice exploded in popularity. It's pretty obvious to tell which group caused the rise.

1960 2018-08-29 10:47:33 Yes, yes because clearly the reason JYP stocks suddenly exploded in popularity was when Got7 exploded in popularity too. Or you know, just acknowledge that Twice's surge in popularity directed coincided with JYP's rise. Got7 contributed alot, but you can't deny Twice's impact.

2028 2018-08-29 09:49:30 Based on research mostly on stocks from IBD once a stock is in a strong uptrend and channel and it then gets even more bullish and breaks out of that it's usually the end.
2029 2018-08-29 09:48:42 It's strange - people start considering equities for long-term investment perspective, and eventually they wish to trade on a DAILY basis. Got to learn the difference between trading and investing first. Wonder how many stocks do they invest in on a DAILY basis. Do what suits you

2151 2018-08-29 07:58:14 I understand the French view as they are trying to operate a closed season to protect stocks, It's a pity that we don't behave in a similar fashion in British coastal waters. We need to get Brexit over & done with so we can return to Pre-EU conditions.

2154 2018-08-29 07:56:48 '... to intervene in the scallop-rich waters off Normandy.'

'French boats only have the right to fish for scallops from October 1 until May 15 to allow local stocks to regenerate, but the British do not face the same restrictions.'

Who is wronged by the EU here...?

2165 2018-08-29 07:47:09 Sad to say I agree with the French on this one, We are depleting stocks by over fishing the English Channel all year round!. 
And we should at least respect the same fishing season as they have to, October to May. So everyone has a fare chance to catch shellfish.

2177 2018-08-29 07:40:01 Does it makes sense to buy Nifty Bees on dips as the stocks will come and go and the heavyweights will always join the Nifty club.
2178 2018-08-29 07:40:01 every week we are gettin some 4-6 stocks in arron weekly crossover, do you follow any other additional filter
2179 2018-08-29 07:39:08 Of course its not what they said. The scallop fishing seasin starts in October. They were poaching. Dont believe all the stuff you read about our hard done by fisherman. They will kill off our fish stocks within a couple of years if you let them
2180 2018-08-29 07:37:36 On se débarrasse des stocks ?
2181 2018-08-29 07:37:09 If the French fishermen think #Scallop stocks need to be preserved in French waters why do British fisherman think it is okay to exploit them? They can't both be right and it seems unlikely the French would turn away from good fishing grounds. #greed #scallopwars
2182 2018-08-29 07:35:58 Onward, I spend most of the time crouched and peaking around corners. Great game and community as well, want to get on of those stocks for that game so you can use the scope!  Will be interesting to see how Firewall goes.

2186 2018-08-29 07:33:25 which stocks?
2187 2018-08-29 07:31:47 Reading a (very) little, it seems to be a shared scallop bed that the French don't 'fish' between Mid-may and October (to preserve stocks) but the British fish year around.

French approach seems more sustainable.
2188 2018-08-29 07:29:17 Is the weakness company specific or more an indication of fading interest in high flyer tech stocks?
2189 2018-08-29 07:28:47 Brother, I have observed you are having some fixed watch-list and trading in these stocks only. Is it ? I am facing d same problem of stocks selection, Can we trade some fixed watch list forever ?

2197 2018-08-29 07:18:05 See in this scallop wars thing - if the French have a no harvest conservation season to allow scallop stocks to recover; why when we have our own seasons for crabs, lobsters, salmon etc are UK fishermen acting like Imperialistic Vandals?  

Is this a view of a #NoDealBrexit ?

2200 2018-08-29 07:16:51 The british boats were illegally fishing forscallops out of season. One British boat has already been fined £30,000 for doing this before. There will be no scallops or fish left for anyone if you allow a free for all. You need fish stocks to replenish year on year

They (CBs) are buying bonds and stocks with printed (electronically credited, in reality) money. No?

2266 2018-08-29 06:31:02 jype really should award twice with stocks... they need to pay back twice with company STOCKS. even twice knows being on top is seasonal. the people may love them now but it's not forever, the girls needs a fallback plan in case this sudden popularity fades.

2405 2018-08-29 04:27:38 2019 is election year. October is the start of Filing of COC. This artificial food shortage is a ploy to jack up the prices hence more profits for campaign funds. They have a lot of stocks ready to be sold at higher prices but was earlier acquired at discounted price.

2407 2018-08-29 04:27:27 In 2008, a lot of financial gurus didnt acknowledge the recession or possibility of a big drop in stocks. But, if one saw the demise of Bear Stearns, it was clear something momentous was in the offing. Likewise, Roy Moore, Connor Lamb and OH-12 dont just happen

Weird data. Stocks above 10D for a dataset of bios hit 80+% for first time in 118 trading days on Monday. Longest streak ever. Second longest streak ever ended on the day before this streak started. 100D average at end was 51-52 so not weak just no extremes.

2411 2018-08-29 04:23:25 Sometimes, instead of "bag holding", I prefer to think of it as "unintentional swing trading."  Because I do tend to focus on "real" companies, believe it or not, this has worked in my favor more often than not.  I'm not afraid to take a loss, but I don't panic sell solid stocks.
2412 2018-08-29 04:22:22 Because there are limited shares of stock, and the price isn’t determined solely by how many people buy it. It depends on the performance of the company and the economy which is largely unpredictable. And most stocks worth selling are not short-term flips.
2413 2018-08-29 04:21:59 If it's from Fox News, it's a lie.  If it's from you, it's a damn lie.  Can't wait for you to be deposed and placed in protective custody, though you deserve the stocks, preferably near a pile of rotting fruit.

2436 2018-08-29 04:06:36 You're missing the point.. Stocks do not mean anything to most people, until things go south and the poor have to bail out the rich. It's a casino with us as collateral, and that's wrong, no matter who is in power...

Please rollover ur trading positions (if any) in these 46 stocks to Sep because if you fail to do so your position will be physically settled & it will cost you 10 fold STT. 

For eg: Traders will now pay Rs 10,000 STT for Rs 1 cr value vs Rs 1000 earlier

2517 2018-08-29 03:12:14 99% is impressive. That's losing 90% of your capital...and then losing 90% of the remainder

To do it on two stocks is remarkable. I would like to think even a complete newb would recognize their process is just wrong at that point.

2532 2018-08-29 03:02:09 When you think about it, Trump is alone in the world, fighting against those who want a weaker America. Only under Trump has the GDP boomed, stocks boomed, unemployment plummeted and consumer confidence soared.

2554 2018-08-29 02:52:03 I totally agree with you. I was just thinking this. The stocks with NYSE and NASDAQ exposure are just unstoppable. Can’t deny it. Go with the momentum?
2555 2018-08-29 02:51:05 Pretty sure stocks are digitized already, and equity ownership is likewise already "tokenized" into these amazing tradeable units called "shares." 
Or am I missing something?

It’s a false bubble that will burst.

2650 2018-08-29 02:07:36 Stocks closed slightly higher on Tuesday, boosted by an improved outlook on global trade after the U.S. and Mexico struck a deal. The S&P 500 rose marginally to 2,897.52, but posted a record close and briefly broke above 2,900 for the first time ever.
2651 2018-08-29 02:07:32 LOL. I didn’t realize tax returns were like porn.

Tax returns like every President has shown since Nixon?  As a taxpayer I want to know if he is creating tax policies that helps him. What’s he hiding? Not as rich as he says? Money laundering? Steel & aluminum stocks? Mistresses?

2655 2018-08-29 02:05:53 I haven't seen this happen for DECADES. Keep stocks up and interest rates down, Mr. President.
2656 2018-08-29 02:05:46 That should be punishable by stocks
2657 2018-08-29 02:05:36 That is absurd. Interest rate "manipulation"  is broad base.  Stock ownership is not. 

Why not just buy muni;s that invest into public projects on the local than buy stocks?

2671 2018-08-29 01:56:55 The CHURCH has made over 3 billion in stocks with the pharmaceutical co’s. the last paragraph stating that people should look for better alternatives than marijuana is basically saying opioid use and other harmful pharmaceuticals are better than marijuana’s “harmful” effects?

2683 2018-08-29 01:47:22 Interesting. I see that barbell but also see millennials piling into stocks (mostly US and Chinese tech). I definitely don’t see bonds as part of the barbell, agree the 60/40 stocks vs bonds split is gone.
2684 2018-08-29 01:47:02 Wasn’t asking you but I’ll play I am giving facts on MY STOCKS performance. Maybe I just picked better stocks but I have the proof and documentation to back up my stuff. So It not buckshit or bullshit.

2686 2018-08-29 01:46:29 And exclusions usually come after all the damage is done never at peaks. Why not exclude stocks from index when overvalued...why wait till it hits the bottom and valuations attractive.
2687 2018-08-29 01:45:45 Do mentally ill homeless people have strong ties to a community? And If we only allow affluent newcomers and block middle class newcomers thru already high rents and limited housing stocks, that's a form of segregation no?
2688 2018-08-29 01:43:08 The market is behaving in a very strange way!! Have you analyzed how many stocks are just pulling up the market? Any update on the Amtek Auto scrip!!
2689 2018-08-29 01:42:32 Even index includes momentum stocks excluding ones like lupin.but complain if fund houses do it. Just 2 ears of underperformance after a stupendous five year run and lupin s gone. Not worth waiting? Index fund also has a manager who manages index.heg/graphite in midcap index now.
2690 2018-08-29 01:41:23 The detriment to everyone else is in the stock market + mergers, not the companies, per se.

Would be a lot cooler if there was an automatic/non-profit commercial bank; or a progressive currency.

Cooler^2 if stocks triggered marginal buybacks from a price=max(return x cash flow)
2691 2018-08-29 01:40:06 Obama took us out of a recession left the economy growing with wage growth...Trump came in on his winning coat tail, gave gazillionaires huge tax cuts which made the market spike more cuz they are buying their own stocks...the dam will break darlin’
2692 2018-08-29 01:37:47 They did that deal with Mackie research and since then they have dropped . I was invested in another company, VTR resources that did a bought deal financing with Mackie and it dropped to pennies from over $2 and then eventually they were bought out by BTO.
2693 2018-08-29 01:34:53 I must not be part of that “most Americans” then, my checks have increased by about $200 per week. Overtime weeks I’m up $400-$500. An additional $1,000 per month going into my 401K, these tax cuts are great! Plus all my stocks keep going up, let’s keep this train going! #MAGA
2694 2018-08-29 01:34:07 He can trash their stocks tho
2695 2018-08-29 01:32:12 Also, what do you mean by cheaper stocks? P/E, share price, or under-served growth markets?

2698 2018-08-29 01:30:30 So we have a financial planner who has us in a sensible mix of stocks and bonds. I have a modest "fun" money account & IRA I self-manage. Lots of fails due to simply liking a brand, but it does have Apple in it :)
2699 2018-08-29 01:30:25 Diversify. 30% bonds. 40% stocks. 30% international. Unless you have a longer window than 10 years.
2700 2018-08-29 01:30:03 HCPG seem like good traders imho.  Sunrise is absolutely right though.  He prob uses stream to feed watchlist but each trade idea he makes his own first.   For instance, maybe HCPG trades up on rising stocks more than Sunrise who buys oversold pull backs.  What do you want to do?

2723 2018-08-29 01:06:26 It may be. But please acknowledge you're comparing a 20% move (5000 to 6000) to a 14.3% move. (7000 to 8000). Also, the QQQ (100 stocks) is not the NASD (3000+ stocks).

2725 2018-08-29 01:03:51 Many say they are bearish but very few are acting it. I have no view on stocks but credit assets have no margin of safety at current prices & credit is where the rubber meets the road. Also, in this unconventional environment, conventional contrarian analysis may not mean much.
2726 2018-08-29 01:03:35 The speculative short in Gold futures dwarfs the speculative long in 3x NUGT. When the short VIX ETF's blew up, spec long in stocks were massive also, everyone on one side of boat. Spec short in Gold more similar to January vix short, nice try though.

2736 2018-08-29 00:58:54 I’m no financial analyst, but Im wondering if those who benefit from the tax cut are investing in stocks instead of hiring people or paying higher wages. Stocks keep climbing, but wages are not

2746 2018-08-29 00:53:23 How is it that US stocks would do well —or at least serve as “crisis alpha” —in the event that UST bubble burst? Is there any historical precedent to support this proposition, in the US or abroad?
2747 2018-08-29 00:52:10 Folks, we do not have to be smart about this stuff. We only need to be smart enough to know that the market is smarter than us. Be thankful that you understand this, because most people never do #stocks

2761 2018-08-29 00:42:47 The NRA opposed the new law that raises the minimum age to buy rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21, extends the previous three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns and bans bump stocks that allow firearms to perform like automatic weapons.
2762 2018-08-29 00:41:38 #FakeChristians think it's great for their leaders to be serial adulterers, documented pathological liars, bullies, traitors, sexual abusers, gibberish-speaking fake billionaire laughing stocks of the world.

Just like tRaitor tRump!
(he's just walking in Jesus' footsteps!)
2763 2018-08-29 00:40:33 SIGN ME UP, I’ll be dropping my coint on them stocks queen
2764 2018-08-29 00:39:22 I don't know what Davies will be bringing. He had some pretty awful rehab starts at Colorado but they said he wasn't totally pain free yet. Then he pitched well yesterday but that's A-ball so who the heck knows.
2765 2018-08-29 00:38:10 Thanks. Yep. Stocks are indeed boring and also useful. What makes you contemplate Bitcoin going to zero?
2766 2018-08-29 00:37:24 Agreed. These stocks were pumped up by the tax gift and the buybacks. The stocks have nothing to do with our economy.
2767 2018-08-29 00:37:05 I would love a website that just selects random stocks and give you info on them.

Anyone aware of a site like this?
2768 2018-08-29 00:36:10 my stocks have likes potlucks
2769 2018-08-29 00:35:27 Only a MORON would give credit to a party that passed not one economic policy in 2017 that would impact the economy. They only cared about their tax scam that benefits the rich, which was only 6 months ago;all its done is allowed Corps to buy back stocks. No trickle down,just up!
2770 2018-08-29 00:33:35 stocks bad
2771 2018-08-29 00:32:37 Yes.  No one is sure where things stand on controlled drugs especially (when stocks cannot be held). Don't want to go back to "before meds" w a 6'2" teen.
2772 2018-08-29 00:32:33 I would imagine that's the direction they're going since they said Davies will be back with the big club when eligible on the 2nd.
2773 2018-08-29 00:31:21 Stocks & lots of stuff!  I am thrifty.
2774 2018-08-29 00:30:47 @RosemryS  Would love to get some advice on beginner stocks.
2775 2018-08-29 00:30:03 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. trade forex stocks
2776 2018-08-29 00:28:50 Likely, but there's still a risk it the Crows don't get pick 1. SOS will keep his cards very close to his chest in that regard. I doubt very much he'll rule JL out of there's the possibility of bolstering the Blues' draft stocks.
2777 2018-08-29 00:28:48 That settles store of wealth question. Stocks vs Currency
2778 2018-08-29 00:28:13 Why everyone wants cannabis stocks should I get in too #fomo #cannabisstock
2779 2018-08-29 00:28:03 You and me both. Like you hinted at on tasty yesterday, lots of opportunity in individual stocks. Trying to stay away from DIA/SPY until certain indicators give way. Interested in your thoughts on real estate? (I'm from Illinois.... lol)
2780 2018-08-29 00:27:34 Stocks is downnnnnn
2781 2018-08-29 00:27:16 Security tokens is the future of stocks, but we’ll see utility tokens. Utility tokens inject capital into networks unlike companies
2782 2018-08-29 00:26:57 The best thing about researching microcap stocks is that now the ad guys think I want Mexican food, hurricane-proof doors, vascular implants, and cutlery. (I only want one of those things.)
2783 2018-08-29 00:26:45 Remember all those stocks Carl Icahn pumped ? NFLX HLF etc lol
2784 2018-08-29 00:25:41 No way! Don’t stop until they all are hanging their heads in shame. I vote we bring back the scold’s bridal/stocks for #fakenews pushers.
2785 2018-08-29 00:25:17 I really feel sorry for you "LOVER OF STOCKS", and truly hope one day you learn the reason/purpose/meaning of life and your purpose, LOVE PEOPLE/LIFE not stocks
2786 2018-08-29 00:24:12 With no background in finance, It's good i don’t really understand much about macro economics. Be it about india, USA or the world. 

It removes most of noise & i can easily concentrate on tracking earnings of the stocks in my portfolio.
2787 2018-08-29 00:23:26 Jack Reed-lifetime politician done little for RI. Jim Langevin-lifetime politician no meaningful legislation proposed, done nothing for RI. Sheldon and Cicciline, 2 laughing stocks doing nothing for RI. All rich, no concern for you.  Why vote for these leeches?
2788 2018-08-29 00:23:00 1. 10day Sma. 
2. no, but I do put avwap on significant events on many stocks, the avwap is useful quite often
3. no. IB
2789 2018-08-29 00:21:43 Nice movement for $KGKG over the past few days.  Looks like the market is starting to discover it.  I like $CANB and $KGKG very much.  Also think $VATE and $SIPC will be big winners, too.  I’m a “no” on stocks that have already gotten discovered this year like $CVSI and $POTN.
2790 2018-08-29 00:20:57 But those both are pot stocks with horrible earnings & are much more speculative. 

Everyone looked at stuff like DBX and thought "new glamour". In fact, most CANSLIM quality IPOs have been the victims. Seems the fact DBX got such a bad reception says something more is happening.
2791 2018-08-29 00:20:50 #ASX200 trading 5.50 pts higher this morning.

2792 2018-08-29 00:19:09 marijuana stocks are at all-time highs, think I'll write that down....
2793 2018-08-29 00:19:07 Let's see: Tiny population with valuable exportable natural resources. Evil capitalist buy their cod and aluminium, funding their little paradise.  And Banking. Like Norway - $1T investment fund (in stocks & bonds, of course) funded by oil rights. Foreign capitalists fund it all
2794 2018-08-29 00:18:51 October pa ning stocks ani. Hihi
2795 2018-08-29 00:18:22 good night for real life is so many gundam games that will never get localized it stocks like a cute game
2796 2018-08-29 00:18:01 Quick call with the Legal Team...  Have identified @OTechnical1 as the same person behind a now deleted ID that is trying to Frame me for a Crime he committed.  PLEASE BE AWARE if this Con Artist.  #stocks #optionstrading He deleted StockTwit and original Twitter ID.  
2797 2018-08-29 00:16:54 Not arguing with your base point, but I will debate you on the fact that the NASDAQ increase helps workers on their 401k. This is because the NASDAQ has been driven by 5 major companies (i.e. Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Gilead Sciences, and Biogen Idec). Most stocks aren't booming.
2798 2018-08-29 00:15:41 Guerra was pretty darn good until the last 4 or 5 starts. His ERA was at about 3.40 at the end of July.
2799 2018-08-29 00:15:35 Just watched a guy on CNBC talking about people on the left in Washington wanting to break up Facebook, etc. Sure, the solution to the 2008 mortgage & banking crisis and massive systemic risk was to make those banks *even bigger*.... but FAANG stocks—Cries to end the monopoly?!?
2800 2018-08-29 00:14:14 $HMNY lot of people lost big money here, some even lost life savings, so you just want to rub it in little more huh LOVER OF STOCKS!!!
2801 2018-08-29 00:13:27 This is not a measurement how you run the nation. It's exactly a poor status of what you represent. With your tax cuts the rich buy back their stocks and get richer. 1/2
2802 2018-08-29 00:12:48 anyone know any app/websites I can use to trade REAL stocks with fake money?
2803 2018-08-29 00:12:34 Personally, I don’t believe anyone needs a semi-automatic firearm (pistol, rifle, whatever) with a 30-round clip. I don’t think we need bump stocks. I definitely don’t think automatic weapons should be available for private ownership (as is their current legal status).
2804 2018-08-29 00:11:29 Supposedly a little cheaper than last years iPhone X if rumors are to be believed. It’s the possibility that they are offering (rumors again) a 3rd MUCH cheaper phone that is driving Apple stocks way up.
2805 2018-08-29 00:10:18 #CNBC #cannabis #investing #stocks nobody better on marihoochie play than Tim Seymour. IMO, he is the best analyst out there to analyze who are the Contenders, and who are the Pretenders.
2806 2018-08-29 00:10:09 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2807 2018-08-29 00:09:50 @RX931 #KuwentongKapatid my older brother and I love having “kulambo” for our paa until one night my brother (or was it me?) couldn’t find the kulambo, and since we just had a kalbo hairstyle, we “kuskos” our paa on the head instead. Now, I just keep stocks of small kulambos.
2808 2018-08-29 00:06:30 Witness those time-wasting forums where F/A Priests harp on technical analytics as being "voodoo". These know-it-alls lock onto stocks which are supposed to work according to the accounting bones they throw and often lose. Then they double down on losers. LTBH F/A types kill me.
2809 2018-08-29 00:06:05 Certainly not a smart comment by me but the starting pitchers you originally mentioned were not upgrades numberwise at the time. That has changed as far as Guerra goes but the Crew is still 6th in MLB in quality starts. That means the SP's have performed all year.
2810 2018-08-29 00:04:14 Good work and thanks for sharing. I wish I had bandwidth like you to share my successes and failures actively trading. I make a decent wage trading stocks/options but being socially active, providing free advise and making recs seems quite demanding!
2811 2018-08-29 00:03:27 What's your speculation number on the percentage of Americans that have any of those things you listed? Lemme guess you think 90% or more have stocks, ira, 401k AND life insurance, huh? Sad.

2813 2018-08-29 00:00:31 Stocks has been up for over 6 years. Using your example, NFLX shot up in 2012 and hasn't looked back since then.
