6 2018-12-09 23:59:03 I am not modelling. I am presenting data. Whatever model is applied the margins to absorb error are huge. Also the oil boom is over. Those fast growing countries from 2007 to 2014 are bust. Davis & Redwood were out of date even at the referendum. R-M has a better grip on reality.

I'm guessing the meat will be caribou and seal for the protein...it is not realistic to think that Trees could be planted and you would have timber....and cement, roads are frozen you dont need pavement....fuel, must be oil there...
10 2018-12-09 23:57:54 Turn off the taps. Turn off the petroleum that Quebec uses. No more diesel or gasoline or propane. No articles of plastic.

Eat your damn Maple Syrup cold...because without Oil...you may as well go back to the 1860's
11 2018-12-09 23:57:44 So when are they cutting off oil shipments from the Saudis, Venezuela and USA? Just wondering if they are serious or just wanting more money for a pipeline?

32 2018-12-09 23:56:37 Empty gestures are meaningless and it's all the Conservatives have to offer at this point.

While the Conservatives are offering "thoughts and prayers" to the Oil and Gas industry, the other parties are actually doing things.
33 2018-12-09 23:56:36 I have this idea for a stuffed pepper. Scramble and bake tofu with spicy spices like cumin, cayenne, etc then stuff jalapenos with it and some tomato sauce and bake it too. I think that'd be good <3 Even add some olive oil drizzled on top.
34 2018-12-09 23:56:33 @JustinTrudeau Make Alberta a priority in public policy.  Ram the pipelines, both gas and oil, east to west, and start building NOW.   The only other time that the East ever made the West a national priority was when you grabbed a piece of our petroleum revenue.
35 2018-12-09 23:56:30 I’ve honestly just been using extra virgin coconut oil for my eye makeup removal
36 2018-12-09 23:56:14 You are snake oil NBC
37 2018-12-09 23:56:09 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
38 2018-12-09 23:56:01 wait do they have vapes for cbd oil? if so where can i get one and how much are they
39 2018-12-09 23:55:43 that’s one interesting looking stick
40 2018-12-09 23:55:43 Because the world doesn't revolve around just us and other 3rd world and developing countries need this oil. Unless you don't care and just want them to die?
41 2018-12-09 23:55:38 It may not last but I am enjoying the Flames hot run of late. The first time in 25 years they have been in top spot in the Western Conference. Another BIG game in Edm tonight against McDavid and the Oil. #YYC #YEG #BattleofAlberta

49 2018-12-09 23:54:59 Cbd oil is effective, cheaper than rx meds and has pharma scared
50 2018-12-09 23:54:45 It’s interesting to read articles written by doctors or the medical community. What good does it do them if a plant can heal ailments. So, they will find ways to call the healing properties of hemp... or garlic, or honey, or turmeric... as snake oil. Because, big pharma pays... $
51 2018-12-09 23:54:42 You can do that too tbh I did it on myself to help my hair grow I just put oil in the microwave for a few seconds and massaged my scalp
52 2018-12-09 23:54:39 Wow gracias x los datos. Luego llegó la Tropical Oil Company q sabes de ellos? Mi abuelo trabajó con ellos hasta llamarse Ecopetrol y ahí se pensionó y mis tios también se pensionaron con Ecopetrol.

53 2018-12-09 23:54:34 this money could swamp big oil and coal's purchases of GOP and help them suddenly become believers in science
54 2018-12-09 23:54:30 @BetoORourke  is an establishment dem. He votes to deregulate Wall Street and increase military spending. He also takes money from the oil and gas industry. He’s a very charismatic individual but he is a centrist at heart. Don’t be fooled.
55 2018-12-09 23:54:25 motor oil be hittin
56 2018-12-09 23:54:12 Not even close. Oil is an open market, something Scheer knows fully well. The govt doesn't import oil, companies do, and companies want to buy cheap light gases right now, not expensive-to-carry/process heavy tar. Them's the breaks.
57 2018-12-09 23:54:06 The kind of immediate wins we are talking about need to be 50% local parking taxes, 10¢+ federal gas tax for transit, cut $4b fed direct subsidies for oil&gas, federal fix-it first and complete steeet policy for roads.

Only options will make drivers elastic to gas prices.
58 2018-12-09 23:54:06 They will continue pumping oil, even if non of it would be turned into fuel. Oil is rather valuable resource for other uses.
59 2018-12-09 23:54:05 ...and use diesel GenSets to charge electric cars....

It seems the ‘light in their loafers’ set is unaware of Northern Canada and good old fashioned Prairie winters....when they rant about oil and gas elimination.....

62 2018-12-09 23:53:44 Bumper stickers are ok though. It lets me spot a**hole Prius drivers before they cut across my lane...
63 2018-12-09 23:53:44 Third world and developing countries rely on oil. They have no alternative. Shutting down oil production entirely condemns people to death.
64 2018-12-09 23:53:41 @MBS_KSA2030 BS is a murderer. Saudi Arabia is a joke as long as he is leading the country. 3rd. World. Bullshit. You have oil. We have tech. Which one do you think is going to last longer? No tech companies want to partner with a murderer. Bad move idiot.
65 2018-12-09 23:53:27 it did not spike on Friday that is a lie. Time to end opec and use our own oil
66 2018-12-09 23:53:22 -Signed VA Choice Act and VA Accountability Act, expanded VA telehealth services, walk-in-clinics and same-day urgent primary and mental health care.
-Increased our coal exports by 60%; U.S. oil production recently reached all-time high.

68 2018-12-09 23:53:09 You need to take care of your nails. Use cuticle oil and hand lotion!

70 2018-12-09 23:53:02 Coal technology has been cleaned up but not a home heating source anymore that I know of. Old coal heat left sooty dust in homes, probably lungs. We had oil heat into 70s.
71 2018-12-09 23:52:58 B/c although we’ve made this purchase - there is still much money to be spent to get any oil moving. 

We also have to think of financial cost of climate change, inevitable oil spills & failing to be competitive in renewable sector, which we know is the future. #cdnpoli

73 2018-12-09 23:52:36 If it's not socially acceptable...then they can turn off their furnaces, stoves, computers, TV's, cell phones, cars, stop using their refrigerators etc...because they all need petroleum. No oil...no stuff.

Put that in your pipe and smoke it Quebec!!!

75 2018-12-09 23:52:17 I’ve got just over $50 to my name after paying for spring tuition and my dumbass scheduled a vet appointment AND an oil change this week...... and I’ve got 20 miles until I run out of gas
76 2018-12-09 23:51:37 Sometimes I think I’m dead already or in the Truman show and being subtly fucked with by the world. I hear about essential oils and cbd oil every two seconds on everything and it feels like it’s directed at me to irritate me
77 2018-12-09 23:51:34 LRTs: Put it this way, how socialist can a method of transport be if it’s A: made the fortunes of billionaires from the Rockefeller’s to the Kochs, B: props up every big oil company in the world and C: is synonymous with Henry Ford and Elon Musk?
78 2018-12-09 23:51:28 Maybe when a coach flight from NYC to Boston or LA to San Fran cost $1200 maybe just maybe we will consider treating oil/gasoline as a utility instead of letting Wall Street futures dictate pricing, regardless of actual supply and demand.
79 2018-12-09 23:51:23 It gonna sound basic but have you tried just an anti bacterial soap? Follow it with a light amount of tea tree oil or if the breakout is way far along and really read and raised, use toothpaste overnight
80 2018-12-09 23:51:19 The overall greed of oil barons n moguls, the type who would buy a invention that would reduce man's reliability on oil, lessen the polution of fossil fuels. To buy it, patent it, n lock it away in a safe for over 40 years, prob would not even think about this hypothasis,

83 2018-12-09 23:51:03 Scooping oil out of the gutter shouldn't be blamed on Buhari  or extreme poverty, Its just disgusting. Poor people don't realize the health effects of gutter water?
84 2018-12-09 23:50:54 I thought this said "I love oil" and I was so confused
85 2018-12-09 23:50:39 Trueeee my grandma used to have a hot cap that she’d do my hot oil treatments with and it used to feel soooo good

87 2018-12-09 23:50:10 Drink plenty of water, drink ginger tea, use nasal spray, use eucalyptus oil on the root of your mouth and drink a glass of water afterwards. Use a humidifier that helps too.
88 2018-12-09 23:50:05 If you're YouTube literate, there's a spectacular video of an elderly gent with Parkinson's, all twisted and miserable that finds major relief in seconds with a few drops of cannabis oil under his tongue that you should see.
89 2018-12-09 23:50:00 I thought they changed to all vegetable oil in the 1990s?
90 2018-12-09 23:49:59 To maintain credibility of true left- center Libs must stop kissing too many ultra richse.g. tax lowering, kiss kiss w Alberta Oil mfctrs, pharma mfctrs etc(even got burned tryin to kiss too much w Trumps family months back), cut 60+% pharma price or bring some drug plan etc 1st
91 2018-12-09 23:49:51 He's an oil slick
92 2018-12-09 23:49:35 What policies to substantially reduce oil use wouldn't spike fuel prices? '70s style ration lines?

98 2018-12-09 23:49:08 You don't understand. We can't switch overnight to renewables. So, in the mean time, who do you support? Oil demand will rise if you like it or not. Adding pipeline capacity in Canada to the coast will displace coal, burning fuels in Asia. It's a win to reduce global ghg.
99 2018-12-09 23:48:57 b bloody sight worse if the west said.....stuff your oil!!!! Just needs leadership!  One day!
100 2018-12-09 23:48:53 Apparently the oil depot at Rochelle has been set alight by the protesters.
101 2018-12-09 23:48:46 "by the oil industry" (stupid autocorrect)
102 2018-12-09 23:48:45 I have done it now, it was a simple job but I had to put my car on ramps and get under it, I looked horrible when I finished, oil and dirt everywhere x
103 2018-12-09 23:48:45 Oil has gender?
104 2018-12-09 23:48:36 Well the half of it going into vegetable oil production still appears to be sufficient to kill us, so God knows what it's doing to the poor cows.
105 2018-12-09 23:48:31 Shut up! That is privileged information the lemmings should never know about. Their little heads will melt.
106 2018-12-09 23:48:26 Whoa. Only a true sociopath would wreck the lives of US farmers for a hotel deal. A hotel deal and perhaps a 19% stake in Rosneft oil?
107 2018-12-09 23:48:24 Oil & water is.... a wet ass & dry purse
108 2018-12-09 23:48:13 Actually they are still dependent on imported oil, just net import has decreased.
109 2018-12-09 23:47:22 Oh of course.  The original excuse was oil prices (which were ridiculous) but now consolidation has emboldened the airlines.
110 2018-12-09 23:47:19 cetaphil is the best!! i have really oily skin with blackheads and i don’t recommend using products with acne medicine in it because it can dry out your skin more which makes you produce more oil so you need to focus on hydrating
111 2018-12-09 23:47:18 @chigrl Oil up straight from the open.
112 2018-12-09 23:46:59 You know, we can figure out exactly where Saudi oil is being processed and stop using it.. Let's see the map of Saudi oil, from the ground to the gas station. Maybe we stop going to those stations. Let's pay for some good intel. We don't need military thank you.
113 2018-12-09 23:46:54 Which essential oil should I use to make people stop talking to me?

119 2018-12-09 23:46:09 idn't drop the ball. The #pcaa did exactly what their donors told them to do. drop royalty rates, drop personal taxes for the 1%, twin the 8th most dangerous hiway ( the one to Fort Mac), and suggest that alberta curriculm should be written but the oil industry

121 2018-12-09 23:45:55 However European shares, oil and metals all rose on Friday night, suggesting share market concerns are centred on the US. Asia Pacific investors are facing a softer opening, although GDP data from Japan may influence the session. @MicMcCarthy_CMC
122 2018-12-09 23:45:33 Yeah but I know she's mad because of something that was done very wrong here with oil of olay&this other project because it's not only the lies that she did to many but the illegal money beingtaken @JudicialWatch I know more today "she doesn't steal I know her better than that?"

don't mind me, just taking my herd of oil drums for a walk
126 2018-12-09 23:45:09 So I'm doing a raffle for some CBD oil from Pharmaxtracts. Two vape pens, CBD oil balm, and 1000 mg CBD oil tinctures. It's $20 of BTC per person and there's 15 spots. If you're interested let me know, if not I'll scratch this idea, but thought it'd be a cool idea and fun
127 2018-12-09 23:45:03 And oil infrastructure is such a small part of the economics. We’d basically have to spend a bunch of money to replicate a lot of what the feds take care of currently.
128 2018-12-09 23:44:57 Fue MUY marcada en 2018 la caída de consumo de fuel oil y gasoil vs. 2017 y 2016 en generación térmica como contrapartida a disponibilidad de gas natural y bajo mismos niveles de generación neta. 

Los volúmenes de estos en el pico (Junio-Agosto) también cayeron dramáticamente.
129 2018-12-09 23:44:49 Just when you thought there was gonna be indecision cause of a hot Calgary team, frank bucks the naysayers and shows full confidence in the oil. What a turn of events!! Riveting stuff
130 2018-12-09 23:44:31 Does anyone know why my oil painting hasn’t dried for two weeks?

132 2018-12-09 23:44:19 While I agree with LG he needs to recall MBS dumped oil for Trumps midterms, 20B hit.  Trump took credit and embarrassed KSA in process as now is Graham.  Most forget Sadam was an ally at one point.  Shale oil is not eternal we’ll be dry 1-2 decades out.
133 2018-12-09 23:44:12 Are you sure this is vegan oil fries? Yikes
134 2018-12-09 23:44:07 The first time I've heard from her since high school was a pitch. 

It's amazing we have snake oil sales while robots are driving around mars.
135 2018-12-09 23:44:07 Even better-since France imports its oil, the gas tax there is effectively a tariff, which Trump thinks are great.
136 2018-12-09 23:43:56 My friend said her mama new boyfriend look like he do oil changes and for some reason this is hilarious to me
137 2018-12-09 23:43:50 I wonder if Poland would take in 60 million immigrant from the United States and their military. For about ten years.Then they will leave to take back what most definitely will be a weak shit hole country. With no guns, no industry, no money but lots of oil, natural gas and coal.
138 2018-12-09 23:43:43 This cbd oil really is helping me get out my shell. I would never upload videos of me talking let alone my normal dancing
139 2018-12-09 23:43:37 Ooh I love this is it oil paints?
140 2018-12-09 23:43:33 Idk about the rest but be careful/ gentle when using the charcoal bar. It can strip your skin of its natural oil and dry it out even more
141 2018-12-09 23:43:32 It’s amazing what a little lavender oil in a diffuser can do for your mental and emotional health.
142 2018-12-09 23:43:27 Not really a recipe. Peanut oil, diced chicken, bag of stir fry vegetables, teriyaki and soy sauce. Peanut oil is important.
143 2018-12-09 23:43:27 Regardless our gift should not give OUR TAX DOLLARS away, not to the railroad, not to the oil companies and not billionaires!
144 2018-12-09 23:43:01 We are tired of paying for everyone. Selling our oil for fair market value and striving for clean energy are not mutually exclusive and in fact getting fair value would actually help accelerate it. Let us out.
145 2018-12-09 23:42:55 Going to dramatically fall in front of an oil sheik this week. Me too, I deserve a Priyanka Chopra style wedding
146 2018-12-09 23:42:45 I’m work for PG&E. But mostly AG, Oil and Healthcare. We had the biggest boom in 2006. Because oil skyrocketed. But the bottom fell out in the crash. Eventually we’ll be a commuter city to LA then it will take off.
147 2018-12-09 23:42:41 Hey! Guess what I'm making right now! I hate the smell, but it's not Hanukkah without the oil in everything.
148 2018-12-09 23:42:25 Come here. Let me help you. *Arranges palm oil, groundout oil, small knife for eyebrow carving...
149 2018-12-09 23:42:20 Are you frying the donuts in the same oil as the fish?
150 2018-12-09 23:42:19 Justin, do you have a side racket importing oil? I'm disappointed. Seriously though, scheer idiocy rearing its chinless head. Irving Oil, their east coast refinery does the importing. Irving wasn't even on the ballot.
151 2018-12-09 23:41:40 Time to cut these hypocritical a’holes off. Btw, don’t see them protesting that saudi oil rolling in 24/7!
152 2018-12-09 23:41:30 Thanks L Houlihan - CBD Oil for the follow!
153 2018-12-09 23:41:15 I'm going to try to use coconut oil instead of butter, as @abbyrupert suggested, butter was the only non-vegan ingredient of the recipe. 
154 2018-12-09 23:41:14 The essential oil trio labelled "sleep" has had lots of great reports from mums - by Tisserand. Scented lavender heavy weight velvety eye mask.

157 2018-12-09 23:40:59 @WilkowMajority I was just listening to your Fri episode with the Canadians calling in... I live near Edmonton Alberta, and there is a growing discontent here.  Our Federal government has shut down any pipeline heading to tidewater.  This has led to incredibly low oil prices
158 2018-12-09 23:40:56 Yeah, BS is a murderer. And that's BS for BullShit. He has single handedly damaged the reputation of your country forever. I will never take the country of Saudi Arabia seriously as long as he is the leader. Soon, we won't need your oil. Then what? Nothing, for you, That's what.
159 2018-12-09 23:40:16 I just paid $3 to add CBD oil to my hot cocoa at a coffee shop in Williamsburg, bringing the grand total to $8—I’m a fucking monster

161 2018-12-09 23:40:04 Nutritionally, over half the fat in pistachios is from oleic acid, the same healthy fat that is in olive oil.
162 2018-12-09 23:40:02 You need to get some castor oil & take that ass around the block a few times w a hot ass bath !!
163 2018-12-09 23:39:37 Dear PayPal how the heck do you get off  telling people they cant purchase cbd oil which is not a drug despite what fox tells you
164 2018-12-09 23:39:33 Hard to understand your total lack of intelligence! 
The French Govt increased taxes on fuel which caused the protests, NOT the “Third World” Countries increasing the price of oil and thereby receiving “large sums of money” that you state in your Tweet!
GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT!
165 2018-12-09 23:39:26 Ahem. The Canadian government doesn’t import oil.
166 2018-12-09 23:39:15 や～～オメガ武器はまだいいかなって
167 2018-12-09 23:39:12 "One of the country’s largest oil refiners, Andeavor, contributed $1 million in both 2016 and 2017 to a dark money group connected to Mitch McConnell."  Why is this allowed?  Who do you work for? Who elected you? Shame on you. And, you took 3.5M from Russian oligarch? Who r u?

174 2018-12-09 23:38:39 Some CBD oils that are legal contain minimal amounts of THC. The brand I sell has .03% THC which is 100 times less then the federal law allows. But it is not guaranteed you would pass a drug test. If you want that you have to make  sure you purchase an oil that says THC free
175 2018-12-09 23:38:39 Have you tried hot oil treatment or just warm oil
176 2018-12-09 23:38:37 Baby oil smells so bad
177 2018-12-09 23:38:34 Pretty much addicted to @SajeWellness essential oil roll-ons. The pocket Farmacy is an awesome collection. I might have to blog about some of my faves! #essentialoils #Wellness
178 2018-12-09 23:38:21 Philistines.
179 2018-12-09 23:38:20 Interesting response. There were at least 2 refineries right near the Burnaby one decades ago. Big oil didn't see any future in keeping them open (bizarre, eh?) and pulled out, to Alberta's benefit. It was big oil's decision, not the BC govt. Always about big oil's interests.
180 2018-12-09 23:38:19 An oil pipeline to Churchill Manitoba might be the way someday.  I say yes to that!
181 2018-12-09 23:38:12 There are literally stores dedicated to all things confederate. Corporate America is an extension of the left? Cute. Oil and motor companies dominate the top of Fortune 500. I work for a company on that list - they actually don’t squelch independent thought or conduct.
182 2018-12-09 23:37:57 But we have cheap oil. Thanks donnie
183 2018-12-09 23:37:46 Excuse me, malayo ka masyado sa pinaguusapan...back off
184 2018-12-09 23:37:45 The source in question was IPCC... not Wrightstone. Apparently a very hard concept for you to grasp. But go ahead, tell me AGAIN that Wrightstone is an oil prosepector. You clearly have a hard on for the guy.

188 2018-12-09 23:37:23 Just don't bring it to the oil rig.
189 2018-12-09 23:37:17 おはみくり
190 2018-12-09 23:37:00 Girl I so would but I’m broke my car went on low oil with no warning yesterday so that’s $50 out of pocket this week and I had to take off three days for this much-needed vaca lol
191 2018-12-09 23:36:57 This evenings conversation :
Obligatory WTF ? 
Ok, you go for a Velvet Revolution (really)
Fuck them, you have the nuclear sub stuff.
All that oil ?
192 2018-12-09 23:36:55 Gotta wonder if the market was just so far ahead of itself all this bearishness was warranted. Or, is all the bearishness misguided? Then again, the oil price decline is going to kill the profit margins.
193 2018-12-09 23:36:46 Wow prayers speedy recovery and limited scarring. Vitamin e oil once stitches out really does wonders. Now get you some rest. Always worse on the mommy

200 2018-12-09 23:35:44 its also about oil temperature relative to what you are frying ....
201 2018-12-09 23:35:42 Sweden has a multitude of rivers, steady wind do to its location and a population of about 10 million. Their usage is a drop in the bucket.  Same with Denmark and Norway.  Norway is pumping oil from the North Sea like crazy for revenue however.
202 2018-12-09 23:35:27 I put makeup on this morning, I tried @beautybakerie baking oil, foundation, and setting flour; IT STILL LOOKS FRESH I’m impressed, I’m shook, I’m so damn happy.

208 2018-12-09 23:35:02 Ever since I've been watching Gordon Ramsey videos, I notice I've developed his mannerisms. Whenever I'm cooking I catch myself do shit like:

Pan, hot.

Oil, in.

Chicken, perfectly sliced.

Erection, rock hard.
209 2018-12-09 23:34:58 And the way to do it is lift everyone out of poverty,  and that's done by access to cheap energy. Use the money generated by oil to research technologies that actually work. Your right,  were in this together.
210 2018-12-09 23:34:44 Hint from a Southerner, is all about how hot you can keep the oil.  Happy frying.
211 2018-12-09 23:34:42 tbh Daydreaming about the most 2x taurus moon date I had last night...spent hour and a half soaking in essential oil bath drinking prosseco and listening to keaton henson

218 2018-12-09 23:34:20 thank you, I have tried several things. But curious what you mean about the tea tree oil? I use it but for skin irritations and such. Are there other uses?
219 2018-12-09 23:33:51 @senatemajldr would steal the nickels off a dead mans eyes he's been corrupt 4 years/has taken lots of horse torture money/Tn Walking Horses are tortured 2 get them 2 step high

221 2018-12-09 23:33:43 It feels so good when other people oil my scalp 
222 2018-12-09 23:33:36 Yeah.. when you said you were eating oysters the other day I think it was? I was like.. “oh good.. Bekka can be the guinea pig on if their seafood is a bad decision still like it was the few years after the oil spill” I’m glad you are still with us!
223 2018-12-09 23:33:35 Better to pay someone’s hospital bill or electric, water, or heating oil bill.
224 2018-12-09 23:33:28 I keep thinking of oil of clove... but oil of Clovis might require a subsequent course of antibiotics, or statins.
225 2018-12-09 23:33:01 Oh man! Iran is not so impoverished- it is still about a middle income country. Saudi prosperity is accidental due to vast reserves of oil and a sparse population.

But what I support is democracy and free elections and both Saudi & Iran r culprits in denying people their rights.
226 2018-12-09 23:32:49 Yeah sitting on your black box powered by oil yelling at people is really helping the bud environment
227 2018-12-09 23:32:43 It was a oil change included in that too and shit it wasn’t quite for $400 but close. And nah man Lincoln parts are just expensive
228 2018-12-09 23:32:35 So, why are you giving a gigantic cement plant in Quebec and coal fired power plants in NB a free pass, while taxing Alberta Oil? Cement has a HUGE CO2 footprint.
229 2018-12-09 23:32:26 After 3 rounds of revisiting the bumper sticker "Please God... another oil boom, I promise not to piss it away..." one would think that someone would notice certain trend... #ableg
230 2018-12-09 23:32:26 Forget the oil, the real Hanukkah miracle would be listening to XM’s Radio Hanukkah for eight songs without changing the station. Or jumping off a bridge.

233 2018-12-09 23:31:51 Oil >>>>> lotion
234 2018-12-09 23:31:41 Oil full your head!
235 2018-12-09 23:31:34 If data is the new oil then we should look for a green revolution in AI because oil has fueled income inequality & climate change. Misuse of people's data has lots of potential adverse outcomes as well. People should own our own data and I think energy should be publically owned.
236 2018-12-09 23:31:34 so CBD oil isnt real marijuana? that shit dont pop on piss test?

239 2018-12-09 23:31:11 Trump is a vicious, unstable, corrupt ignoramus, so no rational person—or cynic or earnest public servant—wants to be his CoS. So isn’t his obvious move to select Ivanka or Jared to oversee the family’s waste management/olive oil business? Who else can he trust but the family?

249 2018-12-09 23:30:32 Lack of attention:
Buying TMX.
Capital cost write-offs in response to oil patch request?

What is the attention you expect? And how will the 𝓽𝓱𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓽 (ya, I got it) serve to make our obligations to FN’s go away? This a Federal gov is trying to fix previous process mistakes.
250 2018-12-09 23:30:31 And you'll still buy the oil unknowingly and cook with it.

253 2018-12-09 23:30:07 Oil dey your head
254 2018-12-09 23:30:02 Wrong. Read reports in business mags & journals. Oil mags & journals. It’s all there in black & white. 

Harper catered to industry. The question is why? What did he stand to gain? I know the answer, but that’s for another longer essay I’m working on.
255 2018-12-09 23:29:59 This isnt' difficult. Canada has the most environmentally friendly oil and gas industry in the world. Why don't you check into the emissions from the Saudi and Venezuelan oil that we import? Why do you think that crippling our industry will have any impact. Just not ready.
256 2018-12-09 23:29:55 Chavez was highly successful. They made the mistake of betting it all on Oil. Then we made them pay for it. We destroyed their economy with sanctions and coup attempts because we just could not abide a health and successful Socialist State in an adjacent hemisphere. We did that.
257 2018-12-09 23:29:49 blocked my ears with cotton balls soaked in coconut oil and now I don't think I can breathe properly...
258 2018-12-09 23:29:47 Girl walking through the restaurant and walked in a spot that oil on the floor and bout busted my knee open 
259 2018-12-09 23:29:39 People do not understand that National Energy Policy mandated that Alberta had to sell its oil to rest of Canada at half the world price.

Have we made Ontario sell Cars to Canada at half the world price? Or BC, trees? Or Nova Scotia, fish? No. That didn't happen. #ableg #cdnpoli
260 2018-12-09 23:29:30 Thank you!! And yea it's an oil painting!!
261 2018-12-09 23:29:26 How come @realDonaldTrump's admin is sanctioning a Chinese executive because she dealt with Iran and we are not sanctioning the Administration for importing oil from Venezuela?
262 2018-12-09 23:29:22 これは人生で初めて描いたいちろ~
263 2018-12-09 23:29:12 I need some good oil for my beard
264 2018-12-09 23:29:10 I can’t wait either. This is disgusting.  And I have a very clear understanding of how this one car is no where near .000000001% of the problem. Imagine what it’s really like. Wait. We all know. oil companies still cracking profits while pretending they want to switch over
265 2018-12-09 23:29:07 Really for the head of the FBI couldn’t remember what HE did Boy have I got a great buy on a piece of land for you.
It’s over an oil field.
266 2018-12-09 23:29:06 Lemon citron champaigne was too expensive and yet as the crowd dissipated and became dissolved into other's clothings and "gigs" the puzzle becomes to unravel and still as three black chevron oil engineering students put it: I didn't think and yet Rex was not matched properly.
267 2018-12-09 23:28:59 $100 oil is gone. We need to be planning for transition and retraining our work force, not hanging everything we've got onto the last threads of a dying industry. Signed, the spouse of an oil sands worker.
268 2018-12-09 23:28:56 I believe that would have happened regardless of the US government. The middle east is getting boring 17 years after 911 plus oil tech is better. Please look up what's happening to the Pacific Islands regarding global warming, these people will be seeking refuge in NZ and Aus.
269 2018-12-09 23:28:45 I'm sure Putin and MBS would agree with you. You are working to stifle the economy, screwing working people on their taxes and healthcare coverage. Oh, btw, OPEC is decreasing production, so oil prices will go back up. Good job on that.
270 2018-12-09 23:28:44 I’m trying to start using this Wild growth oil on my hair but it stinks soooo bad

277 2018-12-09 23:28:11 Agreed! I experienced dry socket (it was horrible) and pure clove oil was a godsend!
278 2018-12-09 23:28:01 Yep. Talking about it is the first step but then the next step, trying to access services, would challenge anyone’s resilience.Please, let me add some oil to your fire!

283 2018-12-09 23:27:03 Trump is a much better carnival snake oil barker than Hillary for sure. That can’t be a good definition of a good politician.

286 2018-12-09 23:26:55 The West has been used and abused for many years, so there are many that share your sentiments. Jr has POd so many westerners for many reasons, but mainly for killing the pipelines, hence affecting the oil fields, then throwing his arrogance behind it.
287 2018-12-09 23:26:46 Oil companies are on board genius
288 2018-12-09 23:26:42 We mostly eat meat and veggies. Have cut seed oils. Still have a sweet tooth and drink quite a bit of alcohol. Am supp fish oil and mag. Any brand preference on carnitine?
289 2018-12-09 23:26:34 His platform was;
More private healthcare
Curb immigration
Tax cuts
Abolish school boards
The party opposes the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies and the ban on the construction of new oil and gas infrastructure.
290 2018-12-09 23:26:27 That’s the service guy at the oil change place.

295 2018-12-09 23:25:40 What lost the Oil the last game was not the initial reaction of moving Lucic up... it was not reading the fact that the Flames were fine with it, and the Oil did not “reset” the lines later in the game. That is what lost them the game and I think lead to the coaching change
296 2018-12-09 23:25:35 Wayne seems really obsessed with your weiner. I'm sure that's totally normal for a red blooded hetero man.
297 2018-12-09 23:25:31 I’m guessing the little sage grouse will roost in the oil derricks.
298 2018-12-09 23:25:27 Hydrocarbons are great, but personally I’m a big fan of C2H5OH.
299 2018-12-09 23:25:23 The whole energy chain is based on carbon (gas, coal, oil) and you need it everywhere, especially in Canada. Or you have enough nuclear energy?
300 2018-12-09 23:25:01 Oilers take the lead back. Nice net drive by Flanny from down low.  from Guido. 3-2 Oilers.
301 2018-12-09 23:24:59 I am sitting in my paid for house right now. still no answer from you. Paid for this house my truck with evil oil money too as an accountant though which did require some reading skills.
302 2018-12-09 23:24:54 I think it’s a conspiracy. Ain’t nothing wrong with that cookie dough. 
303 2018-12-09 23:24:46 part 2 - Seared them for 2ish mins per side in the instant pot in olive oil.

pt 3 - removed them from the pot, deglazed all the burnt bits with some chicken stock, added onions, garlic, thyme, honey  and soy sauce and brought it up to a boil

Cut regulations - yes
Reduce oil prices - YES
Make America a net exporter of energy - YES
Improve economy - YES
Move US embassy in Israel - yes

Improved relations with N. Korea - yes (A democrat would have won a Noble Prize)
China - YES
310 2018-12-09 23:23:14 Canada:  two most important industries?  Logging and Oil.
311 2018-12-09 23:23:14 Sí mi viejito guango y guandajon pero allá en Japón es libre mercado y la empresa estatal está abierta a la inversión pública y es la 3era después de Exxon y Dutch Shell, nadie se desvive ni le metan el pie a las demás para que Nippon Oil sea la #1.
Libre mercado se llama su éxit
312 2018-12-09 23:23:11 congrats your getting there!

314 2018-12-09 23:23:10 Well, I just passed @JoeySantiago in followers, which, sure, makes perfect sense.

He's the guitarist for the Pixies and I post stock market porn to satirize a stupid industry that is based on voodoo and snake oil.

Twitter is stupid.
Or Joey and I are old.
315 2018-12-09 23:22:52 In addition, the Dos Bocas refinery, located in the Municipality of Paraíso, Tabasco, will process 340 Mb/d of oil, produce 170 Mb/d of gasoline and 120 Mb/d of ultra low sulfur diesel. #latam #RefineríaDosBocas
316 2018-12-09 23:22:45 Quick answer. The plan is to charge industry, not individuals. Putting a Carbon tax on industry encourages reduction of emissions & development of greener tech. Jill & Joe consumer will receive a rebate for most price increases they incur due to bump in oil/gas/food prices.
317 2018-12-09 23:22:38 Seeing What Qatar And Saudi Arabia Are Doing With Their Oil Money Makes Me Wonder If Nigeria Are Selling Coconut Oil.

319 2018-12-09 23:22:30 I need to reup on some beard oil
320 2018-12-09 23:22:25 Hi - We still plan to offer our PB without palm oil, but will forward your feedback. 100% of our direct palm oil is from certified sources approved by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, & we're committed to developing a fully sustainable and traceable palm oil supply chain.
321 2018-12-09 23:22:24 They wanted  standard pricing for the whole country. But greed and avarice plus the corruption of our PCs by big American Oil ie the Koch brothers has caused this. Don't blame the rest of the country for our stupidity.
322 2018-12-09 23:22:07 Sohi, you embarrass yourself every time you open your mouth. Your government needs to get out of the way so oil can flow. Nobody wants a handout, they want to earn their way. Liberal socialism is not a solution.
323 2018-12-09 23:22:03 With Mexico's National Refining Plan project, the Minatitlán, Salamanca, Tula, Cadereyta, Madero and Salina Cruz refineries will be able to process 1,540 thousand barrels per day (Mb/d) of crude oil.
324 2018-12-09 23:22:02 Foothills gets one early in the 2nd. 2-1 Oilers.
325 2018-12-09 23:21:37 my sister dead ass threw away a whole gram of my oil ... now i’m fenna put a glove on and go get it
326 2018-12-09 23:21:36 I’m out of cbd oil and my anxiety levels are just real bad today
327 2018-12-09 23:21:34 So.... he finally changed my oil
328 2018-12-09 23:21:29 My next vision is of me, you, a bathtub, something about baby oil, a spatula, and other questionable things...
329 2018-12-09 23:21:21 When it's literally so could outside your mudroom door and your oil tank is frozen solid. Maine is so crazy. Same thing happened to my friend.

331 2018-12-09 23:21:13 I’d be bringing in a FG kicker to the practice squad. He’s leaking oil. Start of the decline
332 2018-12-09 23:21:06 You're wrong.  Most Scots exports goes to the EU, not England.  And even after independence, you'll still need our oil, our gas, our fresh water, our beef, our salmon, etc so your point is frankly irrelevant.
333 2018-12-09 23:20:42 To all my #vegetarian friends, #MCDONALDS FRIES ARE NOT SAFE! They contain beef oil (whatever that is.) In other news, my whole vegetarianism has been a lie and I’m not happy about it.  
334 2018-12-09 23:20:41 i need to get my oil changed ASAP
335 2018-12-09 23:20:38 ...and, actually he has cut Regs for coal, oil, Nat Gas...all from day one and our emissions still went down! LMFAO
336 2018-12-09 23:20:33 Says someone who is from where women at young age are taken to Bush camps for oil workers to knack and pay 1k per night. Those ones have say right?
337 2018-12-09 23:20:28 The perfect amount of oil and the perfect amount of salt 
338 2018-12-09 23:20:22 You just make shit up. Personally I would have let that thing die of natural causes. Those of us who don’t rely on oil money for our livelihoods don’t want that damn thing either. Buying that pipeline was just throwing good money after bad.
339 2018-12-09 23:20:00 Thanks buddy. Dealing better so far than I have over the last few, so actually fairly upbeat, on average! Sounds like a good plan. I should perhaps have saved the snake oil reduction until Feb...
340 2018-12-09 23:19:54 Me: *loads up pho with chili oil and sriracha*
Me: *slurps aggressively and accidentally splashes broth in my eye*
Also me: I just want everyone in here to know I'm not a little bitch, and I can handle all this spiciness when it's not in my eye. Thx
341 2018-12-09 23:19:52 Our oil in south east Sask goes through a different system and avoids the bottleneck for now at least. 

I think canadian heavy oils are generally suffering the same differentials as WCS on the spiot market Some companies might have hedges or direct access to the pipeline.

345 2018-12-09 23:19:31 Ayers (diplomatic version): I cannot take this job because I need to spend more time with my family, but I am very honored.

Ayers (reality): You drove Oil CEOs, multi star generals, top Goldman Sachs bankers, and top lawyers out... and you want me to manage your staff? Fuck no!
346 2018-12-09 23:19:26 And it was Obama who permitted shipment of American oil overseas.

361 2018-12-09 23:18:05 - cut off split/dead ends 
- always keep your hair moisturized
- use castor oil 
- read the ingredients on hair products 
- do a protective style once in a while
362 2018-12-09 23:17:57 Friendly cooking safety tip: When dropping peppers & onions into a pan of hot oil, make sure your hands are a good distance away from said pan. If not, hot oil can splatter on your hand and hurt.

365 2018-12-09 23:17:25 That scooping groundnut oil thing I do not see it as just mere poverty (okay maybe it's psychological poverty or something). I see it as Nigerians in their usual way of trying to cut corners or cheat people for a few extra quid.
366 2018-12-09 23:17:18 I can do a lot in my 5 min chef. I just use a lil canola oil spray to make the clean up easier.  A lot healthier than eating inside the truckstops all the time. Yesterday I had my first restaurant meal since 9/11 this year.
367 2018-12-09 23:17:09 Grease splatter screen. Lets the steam out, catches the oil. But oven is easier.

370 2018-12-09 23:16:40 At least the Oil have a bright future. The Blues seem just lost and the young players have not really impressed. Thomas is so-so, Kyrou a bust so far. On paper they should be so much better. This year is a mysterious disaster.
371 2018-12-09 23:16:37 Oil will fly in Jan of 19s....what will happen this month though?????

Will bang down..... or 54 decider?....f knows
372 2018-12-09 23:16:34 But In today’s society we don’t take any notice of serious side , stuff just can’t , but these religious nuts do !

373 2018-12-09 23:16:31 Apologise for what? Does #PDP control #OPEC & the oil markets that determine the rise & fall of oil prices (which affects Nigeria's revenue)? These #APC guys are just DAFT!

377 2018-12-09 23:16:07 Good news. But knowing how state govts fared with the handouts given to them recently,  a sort of infrastructural implementation team should be set up to work with the state govt and ensure monies accrued from such oil wells are judiciously spent for the benefit of the citizens.
378 2018-12-09 23:16:00 Why? Because he does not care about people only money and oil.  Heartbreaking
379 2018-12-09 23:15:50 What resources do you refer to exactly? If it’s tartan then yes. If it’s oil and gas then no.

386 2018-12-09 23:14:12 This is the first five guys here. Never heard of them till we were handed a leaflet. We were just about to go in the door and the staff said 'just so you're aware, everything is cooked in peanut oil'. Had to get straight out as the 2 year old with us has nut allergy.
387 2018-12-09 23:14:05 Yes, but they are more than happy to invest in oil sands for profit.

“Hyyyy”
394 2018-12-09 23:12:46 I pay $15 at superior tire for my oil change 
395 2018-12-09 23:12:43 I read this story today by the CBC too. It’s so biased it might as well be printed in orange ink. Love to hear from some of these oil executives that are privately praising Notley. They are so private it’s almost like they don’t exist.

404 2018-12-09 23:11:27 Oil should do ok... crud... but let’s see in am
405 2018-12-09 23:11:25 If you can’t understand that sparsely populated oil economies need foreign workers, then you need to read some basic economics along with some basic history.

408 2018-12-09 23:10:51 There in lies your problem. It is always someone else’s fault. Alberta is upset about oil price, so why does anyone else have to help? Help yourself and control production (in this case refining) or accept the market price. You had the revenue to plan for the future and didn’t.

418 2018-12-09 23:09:40 I think the intervention will precede the recession slightly, and contribute to it, less because of, say, an oil price spike, and more because of a massive wave of political risk stretching from the EU to Central Asia.

420 2018-12-09 23:09:14 I know things are hard but there are some decisions you make in life that makes helping you extremely difficult. How can you scoop oil outta the gutter nd then blame it on poverty. We're all hungry out here but protect your sanity by all means. Some of our helpers don tire for us
421 2018-12-09 23:08:59 .@SenCoryGardner for White House chief of staff. His loyalty is not in doubt. He’s good on TV. His principles are, um, flexible. And he already has an oil and gas job lined up in 2020 anyway. #copolitics

423 2018-12-09 23:08:54 Climate change happening, yes, are humans possible causing it, yes, is it the end of the world now or in the next 10 or even 20 years, no. So I cant agree, my friends are those people who will be on the streets. Oil companies do not become green companies, it will be forclosure.
424 2018-12-09 23:08:34 For a moment I thought @IcelandFoods were being all saintly with this palm oil crusade they’re on. Then I remembered they still sell the frozen dismembered carcasses of fluffy animals.     
425 2018-12-09 23:08:32 I use argan oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil and conditioners that are vitamin fortified. Shea butter caused my hair to start locking up, so I can’t use it on my hair. Thanks though, I’ve got to go + I’ve had my fill of condescension.
426 2018-12-09 23:08:25 Neighbour has one. She loves it. Sure, three head gaskets down, but still in daily use. Looks amazing because she always treats the bumpers to boiled linseed oil.

430 2018-12-09 23:07:47 The leader of the green party supports the military capitalist oil based empire building EU.
She's a disgrace to the green movement.

434 2018-12-09 23:07:10 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
435 2018-12-09 23:06:59 Well I finally found my #ball that fell deep into my purse. that went to my essential oil.  I dumped everything out of my purse on the floor and cleaned it out!
436 2018-12-09 23:06:54 You should check out @davidsirota tweets.  He is trying to assert that Beto O'Rourke is supported by oil and gas all to push his boy, Bernie, to the forefront again.  Crazy.
437 2018-12-09 23:06:44 I've tried jojoba oil, almond oil, avocado oil and I'm using lush rehab shampoo. I can bear the ichyness but the flakes are just.. no
438 2018-12-09 23:06:40 Watch oil, big move up in 5 minutes from the open.

441 2018-12-09 23:06:33 That’s far too vague to be useful. Which oil focused economies are you talking about and what consumption choices are the millions of poor people there making that you’re referring too?
442 2018-12-09 23:06:29 Boy this Avi guy is right out to lunch! Typical NDP nut job! No reasonable ideas, he thinks we should transition from oil tomorrow! Who is going to finance this? Need Oil revenues to do it jerk! Hypocritically speaks as he Jets to lecture locations....
443 2018-12-09 23:06:21 2-0 Oilers end of 1
444 2018-12-09 23:06:16 I support oil and pipelines. I don’t support selling the ground out from beneath my feet because some didn’t plan for the bust in a boom/bust industry, and con politicians screwed up royally. 

Nice try though.

446 2018-12-09 23:06:09 Economy is booming...but media:Russia Russia Russia...climate change (just like “peak oil”) is a hoax. What prediction from the 70s, when the movement started, has come true?  The lie stat is a fictional number...keep living in your @cnn bubble though, ignorance is bliss!!
447 2018-12-09 23:06:07 tinamad ako kumuha ng oil kaya butter nalang pinag prito ko hihi
448 2018-12-09 23:06:04 I’m loving everything that contains roses for skin care.

rosehip oil
rose + collagen serum
rosewater 
rose face mask 
etc.
449 2018-12-09 23:06:01 I wonder if my car feels like she’s THAT bitch after I change the oil.
450 2018-12-09 23:05:48 Somehow I need to figure out how to get home on my bike with all the olive oil I got from a Palestinian market and sake from the sake factory I picked up today.
451 2018-12-09 23:05:42 Some of that is @realDonaldTrump Some of it is thanks to Justin Trudeau, and the Canadians who allow us to buy their oil at $15.80 a barrel because they are too stupid to build a pipeline to ship to any other market.  Canada is America's bitch.
452 2018-12-09 23:05:37 so easy: grate potatoes; squeeze liquid out of them, then do the same thing with an onion; add two lightly-beaten eggs and a little flour (or potato starch); mix well. fry in oil until golden-brown.
453 2018-12-09 23:05:33 my uncle just said "i made about 10,550 dollars these past two weeks".... I'm about to go work in the  oil feilds..
454 2018-12-09 23:05:31 Let me add 1 more crime to the list for @realDonaldTrump, this on a Universal scale, he is actively working to enhance Climate disasters on several fronts. Coal, oil tars, etc.
455 2018-12-09 23:05:24 Mom: pick up mil. Me. Oil.
456 2018-12-09 23:05:19 Until the gates are stormed, there will be no meaningful change. The oil wars shall continue & the petrodollar protected. The poor shall die to fatten the wallets of the rich. #CivilityIsSlavery #OilWars #PetroDollar
457 2018-12-09 23:05:13 Yup..sooooo anti oil gas
458 2018-12-09 23:05:10 Said by America’s ANTI-HERO, Corporal Shin Splints, the most self serving, bombastic, snake oil salesman, con-artist to ever slither into the White House.
459 2018-12-09 23:05:09 Amazon for me, when I order beard oil.
460 2018-12-09 23:05:06 Funny thing is there are thousands of independent studies that corroborate what the IPCC has found...

Does Mr. Wrightstone have ANYone who corroborates his “findings”? Anyone INDEPENDENT from the oil business? Anyone at all?
461 2018-12-09 23:05:05 From afar it looks like a beautiful oil painting

464 2018-12-09 23:04:19 Thank you...I make a cornbread based bird bread also - sub applesauce for the oil, soymilk and low sodium V8 for the milk, and add frozen spinach, edamame, peeled and chopped sweet potato.
465 2018-12-09 23:04:19 People pick and choose what’s corrupt and not. Obama got a pass for any and all wrongs. Bush took us to war for oil, bill and bjs, Hillary is mob boss like. It’s politics people. Nothing is new here.just silly celebs way too involved looking silly.
466 2018-12-09 23:04:15 A lot of research has gone into microwaving the essential oil out of mint instead of steam distilling it. It’s really hard to get the microwaving time exact and get all the oil out and not start the hay on fire.  Should work in very consistent moisture grain.
467 2018-12-09 23:04:13 .@RobertNeuwirth Calls #IgboApprenticeship World’s Largest Business Incubator? Like the #Bamilikees in #Cameroon. In #WestAfrica we've always known this, but what happens if the system is clogged at the top by an inefficient government/bureaucrazy & everybody gets drunk on oil?
468 2018-12-09 23:04:09 Don’t ask if I can cook if you not bouta change no oil
469 2018-12-09 23:04:03 Because they've been awash in oil and gas money by any chance?
470 2018-12-09 23:04:02 russians used i think an oil tanker to block the pass under the bridge to block 2 'armoured artillery ships' whatever they are called, and a tug operated by the ukrainian navy, merchants were blocked by proxy because of the confrontation
471 2018-12-09 23:03:51 those of you..  that are taking McDowell's  to pastor to pray on it so that it will turn to Anointing oil or Holy communion..  Continue oo..  Your own hell fire the foundation has not be constructed yet

474 2018-12-09 23:03:13 Is this the oil connection that Ian Óg was boasting about? 
475 2018-12-09 23:03:10 Good morning.Tempura is a type of dish fried in oil.Yes!This is sweet potato.Tempura of pumpkin is also delicious.
476 2018-12-09 23:03:08 Ahhhhhhhhhh, no. I work in those oil fields. Ms. Motley Notley will not be the Premier. Everyone and his dog will make sure of that.
477 2018-12-09 23:03:05 yeah..hair wonder oil though not the cream

me: just fills up my water bottle and puts on my oil diffuser and continues to not do anything productive
480 2018-12-09 23:02:12 The mainstream media are too afraid to talk about this subject. But they have no problem blaming oil and coal.
481 2018-12-09 23:02:03 But only Nigerians
482 2018-12-09 23:01:55 Sorry  She'd sink the boat anyway ,have to get them an oil tanker 
483 2018-12-09 23:01:32 Baby hungry? Breastmilk
Baby sick? Breastmilk
Baby has dry skin? Breastmilk
Baby has diaper rash? Breastmilk 
Move over coconut oil, it’s all about the liquid gold 
484 2018-12-09 23:01:23 I would hold the enshrine oil for awhile
485 2018-12-09 23:01:23 Nope. olbas oil is great for inhalation. Vicks is eucalyptus oil in a Vaseline base which is so warming to the feet. It’s so odd but you rub it on your souls of your feet, put socks on & then sleep and it helps with any chest infection. I don’t understand how or why. But it works
486 2018-12-09 23:01:20 Explain why other heavy crude is going for 3 times that of WCS. Oil being pumped out of The Bakken in Saskatchewan and Manitoba for average of $78.45 for 2018.
487 2018-12-09 23:01:15 Physical therapy & exercises are just what you need & maybe a knee protector.  Had extreme sciatica last winter & forward knee bends along with other stretching helped.  Not much helped the pain until I healed. Even used CBD oil.  Still take Olive Leaf & it seems to help.
488 2018-12-09 23:01:12 Tea tree oil citronella and neem combination #dogwash shampoo works best natural protection insects cuts. Safe for humans except maybe during pregnancy if ingested so never swallow.
489 2018-12-09 23:01:03 They use to be simple goat herders.  In about 60 years or less they will be again as the Middle East sweet oil runs dry.
490 2018-12-09 23:00:58 Increased oil prices haha
491 2018-12-09 23:00:58 Besides CDB oil doesn't have THC in it
492 2018-12-09 23:00:53 It seems Republicans support intervening in "free markets" for political vengeance, but not in order to prevent climate change or reduce foreign oil dependence.
493 2018-12-09 23:00:53 Trying to figure out if I need a oil change and what’s these weird noises is too much for me
494 2018-12-09 23:00:42 Do you know the child poverty level in the UK? People like you  plunder other nations that’s why they are poor as well. Culturally poor someone  can call other people poor.  Don’t teach us environmental destruction as development rather oil your own machine.
495 2018-12-09 23:00:35 Nice.. use coconut oil to help heal it

519 2018-12-09 22:57:15 The £ is as much ours as yours, but it’s sad how poorly you’ve treated it, tbh it’s probably too risky for us to keep using it.
Regardless, whichever we choose, that’ll be the one you’ll use to buy our oil, gas, electricity, food, drink, & more.
Look after your exchange rate.

526 2018-12-09 22:56:34 Yeah and lots and lots of those stupid sugar gels 
On the Marathon I kept shaking my head watching all the runners suck those down and end up bonking at mile 20. I was fueled on two eggs and coconut oil and felt ZERO hunger or drop in energy.

530 2018-12-09 22:55:29 Girl and my thought of solving it was covering my face with coconut oil, I still have horror flashbacks to this day
531 2018-12-09 22:55:27 I don’t see much evidence of this study, but let’s say it has the possibility of running out  why don’t we get rid of the oil business and move completely into the electric way
532 2018-12-09 22:55:26 Like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz.....needs a little oil. Helluva game.
533 2018-12-09 22:55:25 To repeat: what do you not understand about #climatechange? We need to get off fossil fuels - the main cause of climate change. To re-direct consumer demand then basic economics says raise the price of oil (eg. through a carbon tax).
534 2018-12-09 22:55:17 Natural gas reserves will be bled down with all the cold and snow. 
NG doesn’t get the respect that oil does
Big part of  economy
535 2018-12-09 22:54:57 oil gaps low?
536 2018-12-09 22:54:56 40% of Patrick Michael's research is funded by oil companies.
537 2018-12-09 22:54:55 But the smell of cooking oil in my hair will last for days!
538 2018-12-09 22:54:47 I start with a basic corn bread recipe. I replace the milk, oil/butter, and sugar with organic baby foods, fruit juice, finely chopped kale or spinach and add flax seed and chia seeds. It's different each time.
539 2018-12-09 22:54:42 Bruuhhhhhh, I just got peppermint oil in my eye.
540 2018-12-09 22:54:32 Crude or Cooking oil?

542 2018-12-09 22:54:05 Why are we assiting a government that funds jihadist muslim groups and kills journalists it disagrees with? What are we gaining against Iran with our Saudi relationship? We certainly out do Saudi Arabia with oil now.
543 2018-12-09 22:54:02 Yes indeed!! They prefer fish oil to lubricate.
544 2018-12-09 22:53:57 Sana oil yieeee
545 2018-12-09 22:53:36 I bet, I actually ordered some beard oil from a shop. Less fashion more personal care? 
546 2018-12-09 22:53:23 But they really need to do something about them.. Things are getting worse and worse.  this afternoon I saw some people scooping oil from a gutter... Too bad
547 2018-12-09 22:53:16 Recently some liveaboards showed me that they use an amazon echo and program it with where they have stowed everything on board so they can just ask "Alexa, where did we stow the martini glasses?" Or a forespar water filter. Or kanberra gel tea tree oil deodorizers.
548 2018-12-09 22:53:03 If they had options,  you think they'd be scooping spilled oil? 
549 2018-12-09 22:53:00 Motor oil tbh, it keeps my engine from locking up and allows me to operate my vehicle. Pretty essential
550 2018-12-09 22:52:44 but you can sell your oil and fish without tariffs to 31 countries. which actual EU rules do you object to?
551 2018-12-09 22:52:33 I make my own version of BulletProof Tea with organic coconut oil, organic unsalted butter and heavy cream. I drink it every morning. It's a great source of healthy fat and also acts as natural appetite control.
552 2018-12-09 22:52:29 There's a five guys at @RushdenLakesSC 
Just a shame they cook everything in peanut oil.
553 2018-12-09 22:52:19 Also, Norway is a fraction of our size and have oil in abundance...
554 2018-12-09 22:52:11 You produce your own oil at home?

557 2018-12-09 22:51:58 I hate all of the random boring things life requires. Like taking my car for an oil change. I have to do it, but it’s the WORST.

562 2018-12-09 22:51:28 Not jealousy majority of the dutch are just against psg and city they only want them at traditional european clubs. Especially since we signed ney and mbappe. In the Blanc era most dutch ppl were really positive bout psg because of the footy. Now we're just another oil club.

565 2018-12-09 22:51:13 Some penalty trouble to start this one. 2min 5on3 for Foothills is killer off and shortly after Kelly opens the scoring 1-0 Oilers.
566 2018-12-09 22:51:05 SA is already working on remaking their economy.
That's likely what's been pushing them towards liberalizing socially too. UAE only has 5% of its GDP from oil & gas. Saudi needs do the same journey They are already building beaches for tourism n attracting investors.
567 2018-12-09 22:51:04 While Canada loses $80 million daily due to discounted oil prices. So, completely irrelevant 
568 2018-12-09 22:50:57 I think he wants you, Will.
569 2018-12-09 22:50:54 Funny @TondaMacC saying our economy is booming. What a load of crap. Poloz is back pedalling on rate rises, car factories are closing in ontario, alberta oil isn’t going anywhere, real estate is imploding + the only jobs being created are shit gig jobs! Smoke some more pot tonda
570 2018-12-09 22:50:52 Poor people in the west aren't the only poor people in the world. There are millions of poor people in oil focused economies whose social proven are funded by oil revenues. Think global

572 2018-12-09 22:50:44 Knowing that oil revenues are a major contribution to equalization payments is it fair of Quebec to be unsupportive of Canadian oil?
573 2018-12-09 22:50:43 She arranged illegal loans to an entity that broke sanctions by selling restricted goods to Iran.  China has no oil, they depend on Iran for same.  Huawei optical comm equipment is 100% useless without U.S.-supplied fiber-optic lasers (China is unable to make).

579 2018-12-09 22:49:51 Friends have heat I don’t. I can barely pay my rent and I work to jobs. My 97 truck needs breaks and an oil change but I have to put $5 in the tank first. So tell me what fucking privilege I have?! For me a white woman with this imagined privilege to get help I quite literally-
580 2018-12-09 22:49:46 This short sided American fascination with oil was OK in the 30's & 40's when we had plenty of domestic & gas was cheap. We don't have that supply now & are dependent of foreign supply. Great advances have been made in solar & EV range. It's insane to fight & pay for oil now.
581 2018-12-09 22:49:42 Despite OPEC`s decision to cut 1.2 million barrels, oil prices are unlikely to be affected. Because if the oil pipeline linking the Permian Basin is completed from next summer, the supply of more than 4 million barrels can be increased a day, which is the end of the game.
582 2018-12-09 22:49:28 Never used one. Of course they replace service aka people. Still remember when gas stations were "service stations" and folks worked filling gas, checking oil, wiping windows. People make a difference. Wife & I talked today of a wonderful worker at a local grocery store. #bcpoli

590 2018-12-09 22:48:16 My brother got us that spatula! What kind of oil do you use?
591 2018-12-09 22:47:57 Would be interesing. Gwb is an oil painter, not too shabby either. Obama woul be cool but there would have to be a no suit rule

593 2018-12-09 22:47:31 Oil we need still as we transition away from it, right wing party’s are bad for employment as they will slash jobs in an attempt to cut spending and taxes will always be there... whats more important to me is human policies and making sure everyone has access to a good life.
594 2018-12-09 22:47:26 And thirsty too.
595 2018-12-09 22:47:25 Running water and broadband should be government programs. And those will bring jobs.

598 2018-12-09 22:47:09 And I actually DO thank them. I'm particularly fond of oil and natural gas. Coal seems more of a mixed blessing but coal is still better than biomass or no energy at all.

608 2018-12-09 22:46:01 If you really wanted to help the oil sands you would have shut in production on your own accord as opposed to being the being the largest Canadian producer  to oppose voluntary shut-ins. This line of marketing is very transparent and is entirely superficial.
609 2018-12-09 22:45:50 Sri Lanka needs to come to the next level, we have money but most of which goes into politicians pockets. What happens to Sri Lanka we rot. We end up paying more money for bread, butter, petrol and oil. Every month there’s an increase in something.

613 2018-12-09 22:45:30 I really don't know where to start with that last tweet!

A country like Norway struggles to diversify away from oil despite being in Europe and with a highly educated population.

Again rather simplistic advice from Corbyn (suggesting he's not that clever!)
614 2018-12-09 22:45:29 Yes. That’s exactly what oil companies do.

616 2018-12-09 22:45:18 Of course you're right. Maybe the best outcome will be the highlighting of the tragedy that is Yemen. The arms trade is an international disgrace. Fk their oil. #sustainablenergy
617 2018-12-09 22:45:13 Yeah I have a phobia of oil on my hands, I look like a twat eating but it's worth
618 2018-12-09 22:45:10 If only we had some kind of a national program to ensure that we use domestic oil first and stay independent from the world market.

623 2018-12-09 22:44:32 i wonder what are his thoughts on being a snake oil salesmen lying to the public and doxing people who logically challenge his narrative
624 2018-12-09 22:44:24 There are options other than the current status quo however our government doesn't like those because they don't line the politicians pockets like the oil companies do.
625 2018-12-09 22:44:14 Enjoy the rose oil permeating the atmosphere
626 2018-12-09 22:44:13 Especially when a big chunk of the money that goes to Quebec is tax revenue collected from Albertans who work in the oil industry.
627 2018-12-09 22:44:12 Turn off the taps for oil in Quebec and see how they live
628 2018-12-09 22:44:10 Awesome!
629 2018-12-09 22:44:04 Can your rig handle a air fryer ...I’ve started using one at home it eliminates tons of oil
630 2018-12-09 22:43:54 Nah that’s the narrative you want to believe because many Albertans are anti liberal so no matter what you would throw blame on them like it’s so kind of big conspiracy to screw Alberta hard for the fun of it instead of collecting taxes from the oil at a good price
631 2018-12-09 22:43:44 Just the word Medication puts me off... Why conventional crap? Why can’t it be natural processes as Mother Nature intended? Beats me! Coconut oil reverse a pending stroke I had.. all natural and 4 years on I’m as strong, energetic and full of stamina on LCHF/KETO

637 2018-12-09 22:42:56 I've been saying this for years that we had our own oil when we buy from all those over there in the Middle East. Thank God we have a president is looking after us.
638 2018-12-09 22:42:46 Yeah, and those resources are called coal and oil.
639 2018-12-09 22:42:44 It's time to stop this nonsense by oil marketers during Christmas period, bcoz this wouldn't  and never happened during sallah period

643 2018-12-09 22:42:27 Fixed the wifeys Jeep (hopefully) and changes the oil in the Saturn. Time for rum and more house chores
644 2018-12-09 22:42:16 I only retwist with oil. 

That’s it. 
645 2018-12-09 22:41:44 I remember when oil hit $27.00 in January of 2016. All kinds of traders and speculators were calling for $15.00 and even $5.00. Nobody knows for sure what this cycles bottom will be, but you can take it to the bank, that people will be calling for 1/4 and even 1/6 of that number.
646 2018-12-09 22:41:38 What kinda oil you have besides cooking oil? Or oil based product?
647 2018-12-09 22:41:35 Are you having problems attaching a link? Wanna buy some hydrogen? Wanna buy some oil? Wanna buy some canola oil? Contact SK

652 2018-12-09 22:40:55 Ten min. Stop and go traffic. Drives fine. Gauges fine. But does emit a lot of white smoke, and tailpipe smokes for a min after I park. But, yeah. Vaper. Not oil burning.

654 2018-12-09 22:40:45 Quebec gets oil from Saudis and America as we speak, as the matter of fact oil is number one as far energy Quebec consumes
655 2018-12-09 22:40:44 You are looking idiotic now.

Corbyn supported chavez in diverting more of the wealth to the poor.

Infant mortality was reduced. Literacy rates increased.

Corbyn criticised the failure to diversify the economy away from purely oil.
656 2018-12-09 22:40:41 I thought oil would of ran and held its gainz. Sure pulled back eod.
657 2018-12-09 22:40:16 Dont forget they (US ELITES  )cheer putin too  until he stopped oil money benefits to clinton foundations.......may be took the money himself....

666 2018-12-09 22:39:25 Help my oil cabinet is being invaded
667 2018-12-09 22:39:23 Sad thing is that not everybody here in West Texas works for the oil field
668 2018-12-09 22:39:22 manchurian tung oil.
669 2018-12-09 22:39:03 Or we stop burning coal and reduce our dependence on oil and other fossil fuels.  Just sayin’.
670 2018-12-09 22:38:57 What about an undercut? My hair is very thick and an undercut made a huge difference. 

As did someone telling me to put coconut oil in.
671 2018-12-09 22:38:39 And your skin probably thanks you. I look in the mirror and can't decide between Oil of Olay or Leather New...
672 2018-12-09 22:38:33 Don't think people realise the number of oil rigs in the north see.
673 2018-12-09 22:38:22 When are we going to stop calling oil a fossil fuel??
674 2018-12-09 22:38:07 Cool. My 78yo mum checks and tops up her own oil and screenwash and pumps her tyres up.
675 2018-12-09 22:38:00 Get an oil cleanser. Text me my face is SO dry; I’ve been fighting this battle for yearrrrs in CO and I’ve found some good stuff.

679 2018-12-09 22:37:21 o yeah one of my sisters uses chickpeas, chopped cucumber, chopped tomato, chopped onion, you can squeeze the juice of a fresh squeezed lime or lemon, cilantro, olive oil, fresh cracked black pepper, Himalayan pink salt, a pinch of fresh garlic for a salad
680 2018-12-09 22:37:20 ระวังหลัง

683 2018-12-09 22:36:54 Ma voi esattamente dopo quante cisterne di Bio oil avete sconfitto una smagliatura? E a stipendio?
684 2018-12-09 22:36:53 Pretty sure it's about an oil man and a preacher battling over land rights in California. The final showdown with the Skeksis in a bowling alley is a doozy.
685 2018-12-09 22:36:50 @MOBHockey score two unanswered to lead @BPontiacs 4-3 at the end of 40 minutes. Tyson Scott with his first goal as an Oil Baron!
686 2018-12-09 22:36:47 Kole Gable (12th) & Tyson Scott (9th) 1st goal as an Oil Baron give @MOBHockey their 1st lead of the game as they head into the 2nd intermission up 4-3 on the Pontiacs.
687 2018-12-09 22:36:34 And a oil change...
688 2018-12-09 22:36:29 The biggest misunderstanding about #oil is that it is one product. It is a blend of different hydrocarbon products. Each crude oil is a different blend. Each product has its own global market. Yet we continue to talk about all oils as if they were “just” one & the same thing.
689 2018-12-09 22:36:28 Putin investing in VENEZUELA? Yes GOLD AND OIL, but who is going to set them straight is BRAZIL!
690 2018-12-09 22:36:26 1/2 My fear is that the lack of action (some by complacency,  some by weather,  and some by lack of organization), may funnel extreme attempts from those suffering.  

...at what point do we have to be at to say enough is enough?  Trudeau is killing oil and gas...
691 2018-12-09 22:36:10 And Québec's Cap and Trade is a joke, GHG continue to rise in QC and they exempt huge emitters. And no one will call them out on their oil tankers going up St Lawrence hypocrisy
692 2018-12-09 22:36:04 Avengers: I want to shoot peppermint oil into my veins.
693 2018-12-09 22:35:58 I just bought 2 bottles of Old English  lemon oil... I plan on rubbing all my wood.

Supper done!

I'm waiting for the self-styled doctors. ..
695 2018-12-09 22:35:54 The problem is going to be building the pipelines fast enough. What’s the point of pumping oil of you can’t get it transported. Then, there’s the issue that refineries started cutting crews and combining units about 7-8 years. Especially the alk & hydro units which is dangerous.
696 2018-12-09 22:35:52 I thought the oil companies r tax exempt, a deal struck w Roosevelt....
697 2018-12-09 22:35:39 Very simple, a soup, it's my mother-in-law's recipe (from Spain), simply boiled with a few carrots, potatoes, some cabbage, a beef or pork bone and a bit of pork fat if available, a hint of spanish paprika and then a tiny splash of garlic oil at the very end.
698 2018-12-09 22:35:37 Oil and wax, Hanukkah’s the kinkiest for sure
699 2018-12-09 22:35:36 ホホバオイルをアルファベット表記するとJOJOBA OIL ってなることに気付いてジワってる。
700 2018-12-09 22:35:07 I would but my car us in the garage because I need to change the oil
701 2018-12-09 22:35:03 
702 2018-12-09 22:34:56 2. Instead our oil is landlocked. We buy oil from Saudis Arabia and other countries and support employees in their countries instead. Results: high unemployment, oil dependency, less taxes collected, reduced GDP, reduced prosperity for all of Canada. That’s Trudeau stupidity.
703 2018-12-09 22:34:55 Funny how it’s always the middle class that has the JACK BOOTS walking over the top of them...always at the middle class expense!  The Whole Universe Runs In Cycles...MOTHER EARTH IS NOT AN EXCEPTION!  EARTH  RUNS  IN CYCLES! There was no Oil, Coal, or Engines in the Ice Age!!!
704 2018-12-09 22:34:54 It's here, and it's usable now. However, active opposition by big oil has delayed it.
So do we include you in the global class action that's coming?
705 2018-12-09 22:34:46 I know you do..
You look like a summer girl..
I work in an Oil Refinery,  so I deal with elements all the time...
706 2018-12-09 22:34:42 Here's an #UnpopularOpinion for y'all to discuss!

Last week i came into the bathroom to find my girls shaving their legs. Very carefully. With baby oil + safety razors. 

They are 9 + 5 years old. 

I'll explain this further down. But with reflection, I condone their actions.
707 2018-12-09 22:34:41 Every govt always close their market for products that is not well package.most Nigeria items don't have access to EU/ US the Chinese always help supply them bcos their  upgrade them & well package. Nigeria biggest  problem is crude oil. Politicians are busy fighting for power
708 2018-12-09 22:34:40 so what was the question that was asked of US Citizens? Maybe you could name a freedom that is threatened by "others"? How's your Blood to Oil ratio working for US these days? Cutting profits means blood loss, just not your.
709 2018-12-09 22:34:14 Thank God we are home. Peace. Sweet peace. In my pajamas, got my Clary sage oil, a booklet on conspiracy theories, and a bottle of sweet tea. I'm all good.
710 2018-12-09 22:34:11 Americans don't want oil they want alternative energy
711 2018-12-09 22:34:04 And it makes good business sense. A fiscal conservative should embrace 100 % renewable, even oil tycoons, they are just too greedy in the now and can't see forward.

714 2018-12-09 22:33:54 Looks like Laura has thrown in with Rino snake oil salesman, Karl Rove. Laura, you can join Karl’s Club with the other , Dana Perrino. Fox News is the dude ranch for RINOs who are no longer in the Bush administration. 
715 2018-12-09 22:33:23 Because the are all just too "woke" to even contemplate using "dirty" Alberta oil in their Prius.
716 2018-12-09 22:33:09 Oh, wrong barista milk. Oatly is the one with rapeseed oil. Maybe it was a coconut one that had soya?

718 2018-12-09 22:33:06 Current U.N. climate crisis summit: U.S. joined Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in refusing to "welcome" Several studies. Big oil scum are planet killers: WE are the only democracy that is fighting to kill millions.
719 2018-12-09 22:33:02 .. would benefit from them. That is also not Socialism.... but what’s happening between the government, politicians, and such corporations as Big Oil is. Land socialism extracting resources off of federally owned land and waters. But that’s ok, because it’s for the rich only.
720 2018-12-09 22:33:00 Much preferable to burning it. Sure, there will be a market for oil as lubricants and for manufacturing, but burning it will kill us all. We don't have time to wean off oil, we need action yesterday.
721 2018-12-09 22:32:59 Mix it with coconut oil if you've got it. Well work fine 
722 2018-12-09 22:32:45 So why don't places like Russia amd the USA want to look at climate change? Maybe it's mining - all those resources frozen under north Russia waiting to be dug up? Oil in the Arctic ocean waiting to be drilled after.
723 2018-12-09 22:32:03 it's just a different medium to tell a story, that is it. 
You could use olive oil to cook anything, but it's not the best to use for everything, since it has a low smoke point. 
Sometimes butter is better for a particular dish. Sometimes animation is better for a story, or not.

729 2018-12-09 22:31:08 OK Erin, you were wrong on pipeline funding, ignorant on your Alberta comments about Alberta, proved your stupidity on oil prices, clearly don't understand a tax credit vs a subsidy and your responses are equivalent to name calling...you just proved your ignorance, we are done.
730 2018-12-09 22:31:04 The warmongering needs to stop now. I resent every life that has been cut short to protect oil, gas, & mineral interests in countries that our not ours to manipulate. #MilitaryIndustrialComplex Eisenhower warned us about the MIC. #IDeclareWorldPeace #IDWP 
731 2018-12-09 22:30:58 1. God, you’re an idiot. Pipelines allow us to get our product to market. All products manufacturers benefit from the sale of their product. Oil companies EMPLOY thousands of people from all over Canada. Many of whom take their wages hone to their home communities.
732 2018-12-09 22:30:55 
733 2018-12-09 22:30:51 Person drink anointing oil back then oo
734 2018-12-09 22:30:46 that oil is used 100% in BC (lots of cars in the Lower Mainland) why there aren't refineries in BC to refine it that a question for your government, not Alberta's, and the oil companies if they did refine it there that would be great but they don't
735 2018-12-09 22:30:39 Of course, the more fundamental issue is that oil is not one product but a blend of products & each crude is a different blend of products for each of which there are global markets. Yet we continue to talk about all oils as if they were “just” one & the same thing.
736 2018-12-09 22:30:39 How do you feel about the economic policies we face - oil, employment, taxes?
737 2018-12-09 22:30:34 It’s an oversimplification to say that Big Oil v. the planet is the fight of our lives. First of all, it’s humanity v. Big Oil. Secondly, the global economic system itself is to blame. 

The fossil fuel industry is but the most egregious perpetrator of bad economics

This is a myth not supported by any statistical data. Or did you miss the part in history class where Alberta's oil revenue was never nationalized? You're making yourself look like a real Ricky here.

This is the only way to get that done quickly.
They know that once in place -- it will be much harder to undo.

780 2018-12-09 22:25:38 Sadly the Liberal government generally seems to be a cosmetic exercise in presenting Canada as nice to the rest of the world whilst carrying on extracting oil and minerals no matter how much suffering is caused to Indigenous people and the environment.

815 2018-12-09 22:21:38 That's the principal sticking point in solving climate, I think (not oil co's, or not only them). Climate requires governance, and barely anyone in the $100M class wants real governance, or for that matter has accepted decarbonization. And that class includes some bright people.
816 2018-12-09 22:21:21 At this point KSA needs the USA a lot more than the other way. I am not sure the U.S. Fifth Fleet at Bahrain will allow Iran to shutdown the Persian Gulf - in addition most Iranian oil production facilities are close to the gulf and can be quickly taken out.

Walk away or stay put, poverty is the remote cause of the subject matter.
840 2018-12-09 22:19:26 Understood. My question is why are shippers (oil producers) choosing to sell to US (California, Washington) with oil at tidewater, when they can now access those global markets that are supposedly demanding Alberta's crude? It's not because they care about BC and are ok with loss

Slaughtered 9000 US soldiers in Iraq wounded over 30,000 stole $10TTo get Iraq oil Instead of getting bin Laden that killed thousands of citizens
856 2018-12-09 22:17:35 Thinking about @FiveGuysUK poor packing and frying in peanut oil and then poorly packing up for @deliveroo should warrant a boycott by #allergies people. For context see last tweet.
857 2018-12-09 22:17:30 Don’t you hate it when house guests ask you why there’s a bottle of olive oil on the bedside table?
858 2018-12-09 22:17:18 Sounds like a gay fantasy of him wanting to finish on his mates face...
859 2018-12-09 22:17:09 Fuel scarcity gearing up. Oil marketers closing up depot this night. Which way Nigeria?? Why are we our own problem. This is a plot between Transport companies and oil marketers to rip off Nigerians this festive season. Lord have mercy.
860 2018-12-09 22:17:04 No, but there's much more than coal here. High emission cars, gas and oil etc. If you give subsidies to people who use renewable energy where possible, and tax other sources more heavily, you encourage people to use renewable by making it cheaper for them to do so.
861 2018-12-09 22:16:48 It's actually pretty easy. You need filleted turkey breasts, bread crumbs, safflower oil to glaze the non-stick tin foil at the bottom of the tray, and garlic and onion powder to mix into the egg-milk wash.
862 2018-12-09 22:16:41 What did people do before olive oil? I can barely cook without it.
863 2018-12-09 22:16:30 There’s no doubt that as technology evolves we’ll move away from oil. However, this amateur did everything possible as Prez to pick the “energy” winners - which turned out losers! That never works - it’s the way communists think - i.e., the govt is smart & govt knows best. Ugh.
864 2018-12-09 22:16:22 I heard there is beard oil that helps with a lot of things but idk what it is

870 2018-12-09 22:15:55 Old and beautiful colored patina porch barrel... thought about keeping this one... but I’ll sell for 145.00... citronella oil pot included for beautiful light at night
871 2018-12-09 22:15:29 Emission reductions had NOTHING to do w/ you and won’t continue until you get it out of your fat head that coal, gas, oil are all bad for our planet. You won’t admit that because all you care about is yourself and lying to your “base” to stay in office. #PresidentIncompetent
872 2018-12-09 22:15:20 Unemployment is a lagging indicator. If it bottoms, leading indicators would have already turned negative. Unemployment will turn last.

Flat or falling inflation, like falling oil prices, isn’t always simply positive. If oil prices fall too far, oil sector employment falls.

873 2018-12-09 22:15:17 yep, they wont change until that dirty oil money from the west dries up #screwquebec

887 2018-12-09 22:14:26 I agree, seems like she is still a little too worried about calories. If you do the salad for lunch, only oil/vinegar as dressing. Or what about a chicken thigh (not BBQ, no brown sugar rub) and half an avocado. For dinner, not just fish but rotate with steak/pork/dark chicken.
888 2018-12-09 22:14:02 Cart before the horse logic. Big Oil is attempting to manufacture a difference between their two puppet parties. Justin has accepted his assignment to adopt all of Harper’s policies, Andrew has accepted his: to be the orange cheeto of the great white north. Morons fall for it.
889 2018-12-09 22:13:57 I done put too much peppermint oil in my hair 
890 2018-12-09 22:13:45 On arm talent alone, I see the comparison. Pat’s having a heckuva year. But it’s just one season... the NFL figures people out pretty fast. Put alway the anointing oil people
891 2018-12-09 22:13:44 But Wait...Obama just said last week that Trump Success was due to him...I think I heard him say “Me/I”  at least 87 times.....I fueled the oil industry, it was me that grew the stock market, blah, blah,blah

893 2018-12-09 22:13:38 absolutely!That’s something they should pay for, especially because thats a business with such high environmental hazards. I’m all for electric transportation and the lowest burden on the working class, I just don’t see how oil companies should be the ones accountable for the tax

896 2018-12-09 22:13:02 Can @JustinTrudeau and @liberal_party just be blunt and honest with Canadians and say we are fine with Alberta suffering while we continue to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela? CAN and it’s energy regulation policies are the best in the world, bar none. We should be...
897 2018-12-09 22:12:58 Too bad you didn't save some of that for yourselves. Maybe if the Alberta government got their tax money from their people instead of from oil companies, who stop handing in profits when production quits, they'd have something to fall back on. Alberta pays the lowest taxes in 
898 2018-12-09 22:12:46 They all have palm oil or palm fat in them. 
899 2018-12-09 22:12:26 coincidentally ABC News Radio had BBC program on the history of Iran last night! the democratically elected president nationalising the oil, the US and UK thinking communism and dropping oil prices forcing coup d'etat and foreign oil, the shah opposition leftists and islamists
900 2018-12-09 22:12:12 Be nice to stop purchasing their oil as well. We’ve got a province full of a needed resource that can’t get it to market. Sigh.

Shower twice a day
Use shampoo and conditioner of the same scent
Lotion after you shower
Use Shea butter and coconut oil lotions
911 2018-12-09 22:10:49 Dunno Sonia,  that's not a rare behavior, been like even before the red clouds, maybe economy wasn't so shit but banana oil was in lot of minds back then  now it just amplified and went deeper tho.
912 2018-12-09 22:10:43 Do you just put drops of the oil in the bottle or each time you go to wash your hair?

924 2018-12-09 22:09:53 More or less says - ‘The oil industry only paid $50 million for ocean conservation. We think it should be $200 million. Thus they got a subsidy of $150 million.’

^ that logic is just bad IMO.
925 2018-12-09 22:09:53 "I remember him, he had a 49 Ford, two door sedan, had a V8 flathead in it... You could run that thing without oil."
926 2018-12-09 22:09:52 Dude...I worked out with Hill for his Olympic trials.
Ran next to him. Kinda futile to tell me I don't know about his track speed.

What YOU don't know is football speed and track speed are like oil and water.
927 2018-12-09 22:09:48 Heather. He asked me what type of oil I use. I was like aren’t YOU supposed to know that? Ask me If I wanted my tires rotated. Don’t know what that means. Told me my vents were dirty. Don’t know what that means. Like can’t you just change my oil so I can go
928 2018-12-09 22:09:38 I'm done for the time being. Utterly exhausted, but got the new 5 speed in, starter in, driveshaft measured and put in the truck to be cut and balanced. Spark plugs changed, rear main changed along with the pan gasket (And a bolt fished out of the oil pan. Uhm?

934 2018-12-09 22:09:06 Use wild growth oil
935 2018-12-09 22:08:46 When you drive with a car that consumes an oil slick at 100 km, you do not reduce. Thoughtful and do not listen to this orange man
936 2018-12-09 22:08:37 Learn the cause. The most carcinogenic type of smoke is created by burning fossil fuels, not plant leaves. And our economy is dependent on oil. Oil determines our international policies.
937 2018-12-09 22:08:37 Oil yaceh zai saka mishi a butt I laughed so hard
938 2018-12-09 22:08:35 Pruitt doesn’t care about ethics. He was sent to dismantle the EPA and that’s exactly what he did. I’m sure big oil, coal, etc. are paying him handsomely for it now.
939 2018-12-09 22:08:28 Methane is the main ingredient of Natural Gas! It's way more productive than burning oil and coal. Just burning it gives us a lot of energy but it's also very dangerous if not captured before it hits the atmosphere. Landfills are trying their best. #Fitness4C2
940 2018-12-09 22:08:19 I don’t recommend Mercedes or BMW all the European cars require to much maintenance. The Asian cars are actually pretty damn good oil change tires and brakes and your good to go.
941 2018-12-09 22:08:02 For me in North East Scotland, on the top of a wee hill, home wind turbines are my next step.  Cheap and will be spinning on the nicest of days.  My hot water is done through solar, but unfortunately we inherited oil central heating when we bought the place.
942 2018-12-09 22:07:54 Being humble is fine and dandy but every now and then tooting your own horn and recognizing your success is healthy! Its like a mental oil change!

958 2018-12-09 22:06:03 If oil cannot be shipped via ships, pipelines, or trains then what is the alternative that is in place right now to replace the dependence on oil? Are we seriously turning the lights off now without a solution in place?

No. I do not agree with the death penalty for civilans and military for oil control.

963 2018-12-09 22:05:42 Exactly, the rent in oil comes from the prime land.
964 2018-12-09 22:05:41 I think there is a lot that we do not know about vaping. You are literally replacing tar for oil. There may be a chance, yet undiscovered, that vaping may be even worse. #NoTar
965 2018-12-09 22:05:30 Are you sure? Diet paramount: High natural fat, moderate protein, restrict sugar/grain. Eggs boost HDL; lower TG. Supplement: L-Carnitine empty stomach 2,000 mg with fish oil gel - once or twice a day. Double check your numbers. Reversible at any rate.

974 2018-12-09 22:04:34 @realDonaldTrump Mr Trump it seems OPEC has done opposite of what you asked them to do. OPEC and its Putin-led allies agreed to slash oil production by more than market had expected in response to pressure from you to reduce price of crude. How do you feel about Putin now?
975 2018-12-09 22:04:24 That's what happens when the government trusts the word of oil companies over actual scientists...
976 2018-12-09 22:04:16 I'm cooking a chuck roast, too. Mine has cut potatoes, diced tomatoes, and broken-up mushroom stems. It's seasoned with salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and onion powder, and the marinade is made of safflower oil and Marsala cooking wine.

Now that the government selling less quantity of fuel daily they are paying  2.4 billion as subsidy. Who is the theif??

987 2018-12-09 22:03:21 The Middle East is only strategically vital as long as countries are dependent on oil. Once you remove/reduce that Damoclean threat, the Middle East is pretty much irrelevant to the rest of the world

989 2018-12-09 22:03:19 Plastics can be synthesized from any source of hydrocarbons, including ethanol. The point is not to be immediately independent of oil overnight, but instead to move in that direction, and do so aggressively. Hopefully, humanity can avoid exceeding the carbon budget.

994 2018-12-09 22:02:52 I can tell you for free that they don't intend to cook and ear with that. 

They plan to sell that oil or the food they cook wit it.
995 2018-12-09 22:02:47 Where is the soy?

Oat base (water, oats 10 %), rapeseed oil, acidity regulator (dipotassium phosphate), calcium carbonate, calcium phosphates, iodised salt, vitamins (D2, riboflavin and B12)
996 2018-12-09 22:02:31 Our gov taxes oil company profits at about 70%. That goes into a huge fund that helps pay for lots of services.

998 2018-12-09 22:01:57 Thank you President Trump. Especially karma For allowing oil drilling and the pipeline, without it we would be paying higher gas prices. Thank you President Trump for lowering the gas prices. Soon they will be below two dollars a gallon. MAGA..KAG
999 2018-12-09 22:01:53 @JimStoppani I’m currently doing intermittent fasting for the first 6 hours after i wake up.  Will taking CLA (2-4grams) and Fish Oil (1-2G) first thing upon waking up BREAK my fast?
1000 2018-12-09 22:01:50 I was already lukewarm on Beto considering how much money he’s taken from the oil lobby and Wall Street, but this pretty much solidifies my opposition to him or any other Third Way endorsed candidate.
1001 2018-12-09 22:01:50 Axis of Oil  = Axis of Evil.
1002 2018-12-09 22:01:47 U need 50litres worth of anointing oil on your head for deliverance.
1003 2018-12-09 22:01:36 I need a nice size thing of coconut oil 
1004 2018-12-09 22:01:32 Because the price of oil from Alberta is your liege's doing you factless shill?

The boil water advisory in Milton, is that a feather you are going to stick in your cap also?

1007 2018-12-09 22:01:03 Thanks, coconut oil is quite easy to substitute, I already have it here at home. Good tip! :)

1013 2018-12-09 22:00:15 December 09, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1014 2018-12-09 22:00:10 That's OK.   Canada has drawn their line in the sand, and it's pro Socialism.   We aren't (yet) nor should we ever be.    

With our current oil production there isn't much need for them.   Our trade policies with our neighbors are gifts.   If they aren't appreciated, move on.

1017 2018-12-09 21:59:50 Once again, the consumer drives demand. When will you stop using oil and its products, then? Or anyone else? Not anytime soon. Where do you want to get your oil from in the mean time? Saudi Arabia?
1018 2018-12-09 21:59:49 Is there an essential oil that makes political tweets disappear?
1019 2018-12-09 21:59:47 Tax the oil giants then!!... not the little people that have no choice!!
1020 2018-12-09 21:59:45 Nope. It's rather hard to get RCAF personnel to want to be in Cold Lake anymore. It's a rather expensive market to live in due to the Oil industry there.

The Fighter wing needs to remain there but the testing facility could be nearly anywhere.
1021 2018-12-09 21:59:39 Last year, @maddow had a detailed program about Tillerson/Trump’s cash flow/Russian sanctions & how it all relates to Russian oil fields that Exxon could drill if sanctions are lifted. Projected profits:$3 trillion. Tillerson & Trump has not met befire he was appointed  1/2

1024 2018-12-09 21:58:53 Do you know about colonization? Did you ever read about Lundin Oil in Ogaden? South Africa? Industrial mining in Congo? Open pit mining in South America? Barrick Gold & Peter Munk? Privatization of waters? Oil search in private lands? Cyanide poisoning? Heavy metal transfer?

1027 2018-12-09 21:58:39 If I prefer my house to be dimly lit with oil lanterns and resembling a ship's cabin, does that make me an anachronistic pirate?
1028 2018-12-09 21:58:31 Cheap oil would be my guess
1029 2018-12-09 21:58:25 بوكاOil ههههه
1030 2018-12-09 21:58:17 You should have cut back oil supply 60 days earlier. Your wine embargo to BC was prematurely dropped as well. Don't be weak now, that is what Jason is waiting for, be strong show Albertans.
1031 2018-12-09 21:57:59 I’ve been eating spicy food for a couple days now! but I have a doctors app tomorrow morning and I’ll ask if I can take castro oil bc some people only say to take it if ur dilated already idk
1032 2018-12-09 21:57:47 How can you be serious about Beto? Establishment is pushing him big time as hes a member of new dem caucus..no medicare for all, major oil/gas donor recipient
1033 2018-12-09 21:57:38 Good riddance.  Who’s cares. It’s time to let go of China and oil.

1035 2018-12-09 21:57:21 It’s crazy how keto works. I had OJ this morning & felt bloated, but then I had coffee with coconut oil & a keto meal & my stomach like immediately felt tighter.
1036 2018-12-09 21:57:19 I have learned so much more about golf course management since I stopped being a superintendent.  Innovation always seems to have push back so admire guys like Jason and @ct_turf for voicing their ideas. Sure lots of people think I’m crazy for selling a “green snake oil”

1038 2018-12-09 21:57:15 Breaking NEWS, " Snake OIL" not POULAR? ALP IN " Ascendency, with Popular Leader( Shorty)"? Thanks MSM,I'm now INFORMED!
1039 2018-12-09 21:57:12 Is it that we now import groundnut oil in tankers
1040 2018-12-09 21:57:11 Man, waited 3 hours for an oil change  got home just in time for the game tho

1042 2018-12-09 21:56:06 “I hate being an adult” I say as I pay $100+ for a car oil change 
1043 2018-12-09 21:55:50 Why should it be up to either the federal or provincial government to buy these rail cars ? Shouldn't it be up to the oil companies?
1044 2018-12-09 21:55:49 No chance Lascelles would have got over in time to block any shot by Jota. I've seen oil tankers with faster acceleration than Lascelles.
1045 2018-12-09 21:55:49 Is he going to countermand McDonnell's speech? Or will he stay quiet, hoping to attract both sides. He's green - Yippee!  He supports the oil and gas industry in Scotland - Yippee! Sadly, you and I know he can't do both. But will he make clear which he DOES actually support?
1046 2018-12-09 21:55:45 The pattern always involves divine authentication - Samuel's anointing with the horn of oil, Jesus' resurrection and affirmation of his divinity; not private reading of the scriptures the Church used its own authority in canonizing
1047 2018-12-09 21:55:39 Salami bacon bits oil spill
1048 2018-12-09 21:55:36 I just watched Everest the movie & weve run out of oil and now I think im going to freeze to death
1049 2018-12-09 21:55:30 We really do though. Imagine paying massive tariffs to move grain to Port, imagine having to pay more for the tools to get oil out of the ground, not to mention either creating our own currency or being at the mercy of a foreign central bank because we use theirs.
1050 2018-12-09 21:55:26 Tasting Room: we offer the right amount of a wonderful wines. Garlic & olive oil crackers, Godiva truffles, Pfeffernusse and melon
1051 2018-12-09 21:55:18 I meant to say highlighter idk why I said oil oof my heads in a GReaT place rn
1052 2018-12-09 21:55:13 Announce a $30 tariff on foreign oil and pipeline would get a lot of attention
1053 2018-12-09 21:55:12 My dry skin is extremely thankful for coconut oil this time of year!!

1055 2018-12-09 21:54:44 It’s amazing how much utility you can get out of a single coconut/batches of coconuts from one/a few processes.

Coconut water. 
Coconut chips outta the peels of the brown back. 
Coconut flour from the chaff. 
Coconut milk after the oil been taken. 
Coconut oil (cold pressed).
1056 2018-12-09 21:54:41 Don't understand the 2nd point. Are you suggesting only less govt tax will balance inflation from higher oil &, therefore, everything prices?
1057 2018-12-09 21:54:16 Haven’t you heard one mans poison is another mans groundnut oil to make stew that you would later come and buy and eat.
1058 2018-12-09 21:54:15 Ooh, love a 2t. There's few greater smells than burnt castor oil.
1059 2018-12-09 21:54:07 i just made soaps and all i smell is lavender essential oil
1060 2018-12-09 21:54:07 Why don’t the oil companies purchase their own railcars and lease space from cp .  They were building a pipeline.
1061 2018-12-09 21:53:54 Have a love hate relationship with black castor oil

1063 2018-12-09 21:53:40 He has always refused to reveal the funding sources for his full-time hoax-work. I would want to know, for instance, if an oil co was paying peeps to hoax climate journals, or scientologists to hoax psych journals. Would you please ask James who his source is, and why he feels it
1064 2018-12-09 21:53:40 These people need to be arrested because at the end of the day they themselves may end up not using the oil but sale it to other people thereby spreading diseases in the country
1065 2018-12-09 21:53:35 It should offend you when used car oil is spilit into our drains. We allow the rubbish to happen because we have no pride in our spaces...its the governments job to clean and repair after us is the attitude
1066 2018-12-09 21:53:34 In this tweet you're pushing the same radical weaponization of oil you decry Harper for, just fyi
1067 2018-12-09 21:53:34 I was today's year old when I realised coconut oil smells like coconuts
1068 2018-12-09 21:53:30 Olive oil works *almost* as well…!
1069 2018-12-09 21:53:23 This almost seems like a plot by oil companies to continue our reliance on oil.

"If we reflect sunlight back into space, solar power will be less effective, and everyone will have to stay on fossil fuels!"
1070 2018-12-09 21:53:13 Well crude oil prices are the same at Bury st Edmunds asNewmarket how does it work?
1071 2018-12-09 21:53:01 全身疲労。月曜日さんがが、、
1072 2018-12-09 21:53:01 We should be investing in the private sector innovation for sustainable options to oil. Instead we’re taxing the common citizens and letting the biggest polluters off the hook. Build the pipelines and put a $10 million dollar fine for every leak + the cleanup costs.
1073 2018-12-09 21:52:56 This oil change is taking forever
1074 2018-12-09 21:52:31 I agree that it isn’t just poverty but if you think of it deeply you’ll understand that these people are hungry. They have gotten free oil which they can fry to remove the impurities. So instead of letting it waste or using money which they don’t have to buy oil they take it
1075 2018-12-09 21:52:16 Oil never hurt....
1076 2018-12-09 21:52:07 Nigeria's poor diversification of exports creates an opportunity to expand growth, end oil reliance and also growth wealth. 

For instance, we can expand a network of small outgrowth with guaranteed buys for exports. Tea farmers in Taraba, sesame seed in Jigawa etc.
1077 2018-12-09 21:51:55 Iceland’s own brand foods are palm oil free. So let’s all start shopping there.
1078 2018-12-09 21:51:50 An Alarm woman cannot even buy 1 bag of beans or a 25 litter of oil or fire wood or put benches with N10000 so where is the expansion?

1082 2018-12-09 21:51:12 ): make sure you're completely comfortable before sleeping (soft bed sheets & pajamas) and maybe put some lavender or any other essentiël oil in between your eyebrows, it helps you sleep and calms your nerves

1096 2018-12-09 21:49:21 This is a summary of the failure of African leaders. When (oil) money flows, they buy luxury cars and go to expensive hotels in London, Paris, NYC, Geneva, etc. When oil revenues shrink, they borrow money @WorldBank to pay salaries which will vanish through corruption

1126 2018-12-09 21:46:07 It depends on where the land use change occurs. In Brazil, the main reason is soy and grazing. In Indonesia and other SR Asian countries, the main reason for deforestation is palm oil production.

1212 2018-12-09 21:36:41 A lot of Alberta Oil professionals and our Canadian companies have moved else where already.

1218 2018-12-09 21:36:04 That's not what the article says at all. It says Labour will support Scottish industry. Oil and gas aren't mentioned; and I should hope not, as Labour shouldn't be supporting that but should promote renewable energy.

1221 2018-12-09 21:35:53 so car businesses and oil companies and auto parts companies can take our money. Public transportation? whats that?
1222 2018-12-09 21:35:51 The miracle of Hanukkah is that there was only enough oil for one day and it lasted for eight. Fast forward to present day in the Weinstein home, I baked enough Hanukkah cookies to last eight days, but they only lasted seven.
1223 2018-12-09 21:35:47 It's not reading comprehension strategies that will ultimately open the cognitive gates to our library; it's background knowledge and vocabulary.

1224 2018-12-09 21:35:42 @IamHerbalaria do you know if someone who is allergic to grapes would also be allergic to grapeseed oil? Really want to buy some of your products for my girlfriend, but not sure if she’ll have an allergic reaction
1225 2018-12-09 21:35:39 Yes, it is snake oil. But “proper nutrition” won’t “fix” most health problems either. It’s definitely good for you to eat a well balanced diet, and if you don’t have any digestive issues then cutting out processed food can be fine, but it won’t cure cancer or the common cold.
1226 2018-12-09 21:35:22 The safest frying oil is a neutral oil, it has the higest comparitive smoke point compared to olive oil and  while EVOO has flavor frying eggs is all ‘bout that high temp

Butter is cool too, but can burn easily on the bottom of the pan/ is more $$ but adds a lot of great flavor
1227 2018-12-09 21:35:11 The Buhari govt be committing brazen theft and fraud from our oil earning and keep calling it an education !!! It's is what it's pure theft once it's not appropriated foe before it's spent like the law says
1228 2018-12-09 21:35:09 It's a stick-to-your-ribs kind of meal, perfect for days like today. Along with cut potatoes, I also threw in diced tomatoes and broken-up mushroom stems. I mixed together safflower oil, Marsala cooking wine, Italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, and black pepper for a marinade.

1231 2018-12-09 21:34:43 No, because it’s the menthol in the vicks which gets itself to work: but if you have an oil burner put some on the top and light the candle and will help you out but also make the room smell lovely!

  1 1/2  cup of  Chili Powder 

 Marinate  Crab in 2/3 cup Olive Oil and  Chili Powder for 1 hour. 
 Saute  Crab and  Onion until done. 
 Finish in the oven and serve. 

 Happy Cooking!
1243 2018-12-09 21:33:45 Apart from Mobil all investments are not needed. We need investments in export driven industries or oil where we can substitute import with local productions. So nothing to cheer

1246 2018-12-09 21:33:21 I've done a 60/40 blend with organic coconut oil, they've hardened well at that ratio! Yes I have noticed that it is fairly light - I think it might be capping wax as it is fairly clean even before filtering!

1249 2018-12-09 21:33:04 I agree it *would* be easier, though much worse for the environment, but refineries cost a couple of billion to build. Who will finance them? Easier said than done. You do know that oil companies are moving to robots & driverless, don't you?

1257 2018-12-09 21:32:01 Yes. I should have written Feast Days. But Feats will do just as well. I take Lent very seriously, so I bloody well need the Sundays. I often wonder how the Orthodox manage, when Great Lent means no olive oil, as well as no meat, drink or tobacco.
1258 2018-12-09 21:31:50 And any artist would have used a better color for it. The red is washed out in the design. White with a stroke of black would have been more appropriate for a snake oil salesman.
1259 2018-12-09 21:31:41 Simple calculation based on cost of a barrel of crude and refined oil, which is about 159 liters. 159 liters x $0.66 = $104.94. At WTI crude prices of $ 52.61 / barrel on Dec 9. Profit margin + taxes = $52. Taxes should be cut and crude prices should go up, to $80-120 per barrel.

1262 2018-12-09 21:31:19 Or maybe like the same reasons people come from Guatemala and Nicaragua and Mexico --- similar anyway --- that global capitalism impoverishes the world and people end up coming to belly of the beast.

1268 2018-12-09 21:30:49 It’s not snake oil.  My friend who was dying of HIV, smoked weed, which helped alleviate his pain and nausea, gave him back his appetite and brought back a quality of life that he wouldn’t have otherwise had.
1269 2018-12-09 21:30:44 tea tree oil
1270 2018-12-09 21:30:42 Barr is just another Fascist in the Gehlen, Bush and Rockefeller fashion. Time to go green and defang the oil fascist Nexus
1271 2018-12-09 21:30:42 The crisis is.... we either support countries that don’t care AT ALL about the earth or we support Canadian oil that is humanely and ethically produced.
1272 2018-12-09 21:30:38 What about 500.000 barrels of dirty oil in Quebeck off loading from Saudies? You trust them more that what AB could do in case of disasters? Pathetick logic of yours!

1277 2018-12-09 21:30:15 That is why I would advocate Separation as a tactic. QC used it for generations successfully. The West gets a raw deal and there is nothing we can do about it, bc all of the people out East don't understand where their gas and heating fuel come from, just that Ab oil is bad.

1279 2018-12-09 21:29:36 2nd but unlikely to own 2 at once. Been in a EV for 3 yrs years now. When are you getting shot of your oil burning Jag and the cloud of soot following you about?
1280 2018-12-09 21:29:28 I encountered decimal inches nearly two decades ago in the oil industry.

I still need regular therapy.
1281 2018-12-09 21:29:27 my car needs an oil change but i needed a new set #priorities
1282 2018-12-09 21:29:10 I’m about to be one of those guys that owns beard oil and brushes. I’m sorry.
1283 2018-12-09 21:29:10 Yeah wouldn't want to get too much oil and salt.  How are dead cow and dead bird usually cooked, again?
1284 2018-12-09 21:29:07 The only way to do that, is a worldwide willingness to dismantle neolithic capitalism and make it much more expensive to take carbon out of the ground. Everyone has to realise that we have been arming the planet with every barrel of oil burned and we WILL lose the war.
1285 2018-12-09 21:28:44 im getting my oil changed and my headphones are in but im pretty sure my phone is connected to the bluetooth of my car 
1286 2018-12-09 21:28:13 Hocam ödülün sahibi @fenerbahce başkanı ali koç, olive oil ve metin şen olmalıydı. Sonuçta sen futbolun içinden gelmiyorsun. Onlar bu işin uzmanı :)))
1287 2018-12-09 21:28:00 One of the purposes of the movement is to make the rich pay fair share of the tax burden and divert those dollars along with cash from our bloated military budget, subsidies to big oil, etc. towards investing in a green infrastructure project and paying those workers fairly.
1288 2018-12-09 21:27:57 "Ah. I guess that explains it." She hands over the baby but pouts for a moment. "I'm not sure the Ellie should be allowed near bubbling oil. I burn /toast./"
1289 2018-12-09 21:27:55 Kathleen maybe you could enlighten me on why this divide is not getting any air time in the east with the networks. I am genuinely interested in your opinion on this as I find it incredible that the news here downplays it all. Oil, illegal crossings, UN, all of it.
1290 2018-12-09 21:27:50 Quebec hasn’t lost anything. They’ve sucked on Alberta’s oil transfer payments for 30 yrs and take in Saudi oil 24/7 from tankers but won’t support a pipeline!! F’k em.
1291 2018-12-09 21:27:45 It’s all about money from oil and coal.
1292 2018-12-09 21:27:25 Crispy River Weed or Kaipen is a MUST try in Lao. Come try a FREE taster sample of Kaipen from us. It's delicious, not spicy and children love it as much as adults. Family produced Kaipen in Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Our Lao friends think the best! COME TRY :-) #cafekaipen
1293 2018-12-09 21:27:19 Got Me Some More Oil Fuck Yall
1294 2018-12-09 21:27:14 At the time of the industrial revolution 1760-1840, the population of the earth went from 770 million to 1.2 billion. It is now 7.6 billion and growing. Demand for energy is growing. It will not slow down or reverse itself. Oil / hydrocarbons will be needed for decades, 40+
1295 2018-12-09 21:27:03 You need tea tree essential oil
1296 2018-12-09 21:27:02 Democrats don't support increased gas prices they don't support gas at all they want to move entirely away from gas and not have to depend on oil or coal.   They want a cheaper and more efficient energy.

1298 2018-12-09 21:26:50 *cues Roundball rock*

*Record scratch*

Jets forgot to oil the tank.
1299 2018-12-09 21:26:39 Because Man City and their oil rich owners are handing out lucrative contracts. The question is in the contract so article should be focused on over payment.
1300 2018-12-09 21:26:36 Why doesn’t JT put a tariff on imported oil equal to the differential and send that money to Alberta?  Makes too much sense.
1301 2018-12-09 21:26:09 Yes, Swampy Zinke's staff entirely made up of swamp critters--from "industries" that can benefit (or be harmed by) Interior including oil-gas-coal-ranchers-trophy hunters. Any professionals concerned with conservation either left or keep their mouths shut.
1302 2018-12-09 21:25:50 @TheRoyGreenShow - how about feds levy high tariffs on foreign oil to facilitate using “local” (Alberta) oil?
Is Canada a country or not?
1303 2018-12-09 21:25:49 Weekly deep conditions and hot oil treatments are a must.
1304 2018-12-09 21:25:41 Cooking oil
1305 2018-12-09 21:25:18 Finally bought me an oil diffuser
1306 2018-12-09 21:25:16 There is also nuclear and oil.

1308 2018-12-09 21:25:00 Good ignore him and Tkachuk’s bullshit and the oil will ol win.  Get sucked into an emotional slug fest and the oil will blow it again.

1311 2018-12-09 21:24:17 I find it really fucked up that everyone else pays 45$ for an oil change and I have to pay 70$ 
1312 2018-12-09 21:24:16 It is. But the whole Russian thing comes to mind, yet again. Rice is a scholar on Russia and the Soviet Union. Tillerson had strong business/oil ties related to Russia. The plot thickens when it comes to Russia??? 
1313 2018-12-09 21:24:03 I can't take nsaids and CBD oil helps with my inflammation, you can not get high from any form of CBD, I vape CBD a couple of times a day, I normally agree with everything you say but on this I can't, I apologize everyone is entitled to their own opinion though 
1314 2018-12-09 21:24:03 when can i buy oil for #bitcoin?
1315 2018-12-09 21:24:01 Cbd oil is amazing and I never wanna live without it!!!!!!
1316 2018-12-09 21:23:52 Except Quebec doesn't import oil from anywhere. Refining companies do.
1317 2018-12-09 21:23:49 QC is opposed to AB oil because of the "environment", and yet dump billions of litres of raw sewage into the St. Lawrence bc they need to "maintain" their sewer systems. It is the same as Victoria pumping sewage into the ocean, but not wanting 1 add'd tanker per day in traffic
1318 2018-12-09 21:23:21 I was a Forman in the oil field for 2 years as well, did basic construction. So I guess that's another 2?
1319 2018-12-09 21:23:04 #InsteadOfCookiesSantaGot Beard Oil.
1320 2018-12-09 21:22:54 It does have anti-inflammatory activity. It's not easily absorbed though. You can increase absorption by adding piperine from black pepper & a source of fat, like olive oil.
1321 2018-12-09 21:22:50 Alberta is the only source of oil and gas? Who knew?
1322 2018-12-09 21:22:30 i was having a Sexy Time until cúnla used lotion containing almond oil as lube

1327 2018-12-09 21:22:11 #Russia knows 100% that
Hafter is just an #US agent .
, I guess that #Moscow moved

#UAE has an ability to deal w/russians in that way .

1329 2018-12-09 21:21:47 I agree that alternative energy needs investment but it will not happen overnight. In the meantime AB is the cleanest developer of oil products. Importing $Billions of oil from Saudi does more harm to the environment. Carbon Tax should go to Alt energy not poor people, as it is.
1330 2018-12-09 21:21:47 Can we tar and feather him with his oil money?
1331 2018-12-09 21:21:42 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you
1332 2018-12-09 21:21:37 By your argument doctors are biased against the sugar industry b/c they tell us to exercise 

The ICCP does not profit monetarily from reducing greenhouse gasses. Mr. Wrightstone DOES however profit from the continuation of oil prospecting..
1333 2018-12-09 21:21:19 u r the rosehip oil of ppl
1334 2018-12-09 21:21:17 I assume you talking about oil - that’s a bonus - we have got plenty other resources
1335 2018-12-09 21:21:15 Hmmm if only there was another way to move our oil...
1336 2018-12-09 21:21:03 Oh oga he for change ein oil. He for release

1340 2018-12-09 21:20:40 This will not stand. He puts the tyke in oil tycoon.

1342 2018-12-09 21:20:08 Destroying all life on earth to avoid impacting profits of soulless oil executives.
1343 2018-12-09 21:20:04 Whatever you call Obama and Macron's school of thought then. Obama used the "recovery" to oversee a bigger upward redistribution of wealth than we saw under Reagan and is currently bragging to oil barons about how profitable he's made the killing of our planet
1344 2018-12-09 21:20:01 There is no occupation. There is a Nation called ISRAEL. There would have been one called Assyria if England had kept its word. Europe has no oil that’s why you’ve been brainwashed into placating Muslim nations. The only reason Europe has an interest in the Mid East is oil and
1345 2018-12-09 21:19:39 my dipbrow was getting dry so i put a drop of castor oil in there and that was the best idea. it’s a win win
1346 2018-12-09 21:19:37 Ughhhhh. When I got my last oil change they told me that shitvic had a trans oil leak and I just brushed it off but now a bitch is really leaking!!! ()
1347 2018-12-09 21:19:36 I like when your car runs out of oil.
1348 2018-12-09 21:19:23 Sometimes oil companies are going to kill us all and im fucking over it #follo4follo
1349 2018-12-09 21:19:20 my tire was flat and I needed a oil change so I went and got a new tire and a oil change and she only charged me for the oil change

1351 2018-12-09 21:19:11 Corporate activity that causes pollution doesn't exist in some kind of vacuum seperate from all consumer choice. If people buy less oil then Exxon causes less polution. I don't know what kind of carbon reduction program doesn't rely on substantially changing consumer behavior

1355 2018-12-09 21:18:33 I'm not sure if Ryan Tannehill or anyone else on the @MiamiDolphins is Jewish, but I just witnessed the biggest #Hanukkah miracle since the oil lasted for 8 days. Wow!

1357 2018-12-09 21:18:32 The gov't of QC is blocking EE and would rather import Saudi oil than get our oil to refineries out East. There is no way for us to outvote them bc of the difference in population and Seats in Parliament. AB threatening separation could be a tactic to get freer access to market.

1367 2018-12-09 21:17:33 Toh Send your account number
1368 2018-12-09 21:17:32 Don’t show off, you’re planning more drilling for oil, and more coal mining and more fracking. Hardly leadership on climate breakdown? But you are definitely leading on climate breakdown in the USA, with floods, droughts, fires and hurricanes. You can’t afford this damage.
1369 2018-12-09 21:17:25 Time to turn the tables on Quebec and B.C.. Oil should be cut back east and west only Albertans need to stop playing nice and start playing hardball. Or better yet take our ball and leave.

1374 2018-12-09 21:16:55 Is it poverty or is it a curse that will make people go into a gutter to scoop up spilled oil? Avoid oil based meals if you are not sure of the source for the next few weeks.

1377 2018-12-09 21:16:29 That was a bad one. But their intransigence, along with others, is actually contributing to huge increases in oil by railcar! That's just one of the side effects that environmentalists seem to overlook.
1378 2018-12-09 21:16:24 dont forget the motor oil

1384 2018-12-09 21:15:31 Oil and water do not mix. Oil should be with oil as they have same qualities . Water should be with water. Big Oil, sadistic city crap, hollywood broads, nasty military bullying civilians is getting out of hand.
1385 2018-12-09 21:15:25 Your are wrong about wealth tax. That was not the issue. The issue was imposing taxes (oil tax especially) and burdens to countryside, ie people who can't do anything without their car (versus big towns). Health tax discussion has been brought up by politicians as a remedy.
1386 2018-12-09 21:15:22 Fastest oil change ever and I didn’t even have to get out the car 
1387 2018-12-09 21:15:16 More like oil tanker
1388 2018-12-09 21:15:15 Police this evening say it's common.  People buy old oil tankers... neighbours don't be suspicious
1389 2018-12-09 21:15:04 That’s about all exchanges on Twitter are now. If you don’t believe in manmade global warming it means you’re anti-science, in the pocket of big oil, and hate the planet. And on and on.

1396 2018-12-09 21:14:30 The only thing I can say is that they tend to be very environmentally conscious, but even then, they won't always look at the big picture.  The Lac Mégantic disaster is still fresh in their minds which is another reason why they are turned off at the idea of any oil in transit.
1397 2018-12-09 21:14:30 NO MORE ARABIAN OIL

1406 2018-12-09 21:13:30 Yes do.
One of best pieces of pizza I ever had was in France. It was called chevere miel — goat cheese drizzled with honey, no sauce just herbed olive oil. 

Yum!
1407 2018-12-09 21:13:28 I need to set a oil change for my car at Honda
1408 2018-12-09 21:13:25 It’s short-sellers piling on one after the other after the other due to the oil market the bond market whatever you choose to pick, but unless we have liquidity issues or systemic risk. I just don’t see just collapsing like we did in 08. Maybe I’m wrong. But it’s the uptick rule
1409 2018-12-09 21:13:25 When In doubt coconut oil
1410 2018-12-09 21:13:19 Más gasto de tripulación, gas oil etc
1411 2018-12-09 21:13:18 My due date is sooner than my next oil change is due. 
1412 2018-12-09 21:13:15 Scruffy has terminal liver issues so I cant give him anything but cbd oil and amoxicillin.. which gets hella expensive.
1413 2018-12-09 21:13:13 Oil marketers wan start again
1414 2018-12-09 21:13:10 Oh, for gawds sake! Build the fucking pipeline! Remember Lac Megantic! Also, every car moving oil is a car not moving grain, or potash.
1415 2018-12-09 21:13:07 OH and vitamin E oil makes my face real softt. I get a little bottle from the dollar store and it lasts months
1416 2018-12-09 21:12:58 ごま油。。。くっそ。
1417 2018-12-09 21:12:52 You don’t see adverts for Duckhams oil these days. Random thought.
1418 2018-12-09 21:12:51 Do I need to link more articles? Shampooing your hair everyday strips all your natural oils which leaves your scalp dry and produces more oil. Which is bad as your hair gets oily.

1421 2018-12-09 21:12:42 Gotta bottle of goop nd it look like mint oil
1422 2018-12-09 21:12:33 I work in 'offshore' oil and gas. The many thousands of kms of pipeline on the ocean floor, all over the world is astounding. I'm all for the environment but the push back from environmentalists really gets my goat when I know the ease by which a pipeline can be established...
1423 2018-12-09 21:12:16 Everything changed even me because its much more than yesterday the love ive giving them huhh i dont wanna cry but i cant
1424 2018-12-09 21:12:11 We use #crudeoil for our tires in #America not snake oil.
1425 2018-12-09 21:12:03 wash w cetaphil, then I use either witch hazel or eskinol as a toner, then I put diluted tea tree oil on a cotton swab and apply it to any pimples I have n it’s been working for over a year now !!

1428 2018-12-09 21:11:42 The Gronk machine needs oil
1429 2018-12-09 21:11:38 Does the penny not drop when junkets like Poland are sponsored by oil and bank giant? independent scientists disagree. China and India get a bye and where are the global elites investing? How come saving the planet means taxing the poor?
1430 2018-12-09 21:11:17 be right over with the oil
1431 2018-12-09 21:11:14 McConnell's a sh*t stain in human form. 95% of his campaign donations come from corporation, & that's the real number not an exaggeration. His donations are all gas, oil, energy industry as well as banking & RW nutjob rich extremists like the Adelsons. #BlueWave2020 #DitchMitch
1432 2018-12-09 21:11:12 orrrrrrr.... how about we stop bending over backwards to find unrealistic fantasy solutions to work around the oil industry and instead tax the shit out of nonrenewable energy
it's not hard 
1433 2018-12-09 21:11:09 And oh ya like i said oil use will grow for over the next 20 years so your 10 year statement is useless
1434 2018-12-09 21:10:54 Gail ,we need your assistance . We are a group of 70 to 80 year olds who are having a collective senior moment . We remember going to a great restaurant in Providence on or near Allen’s Avenue near the oil fields and the water it served great scorpion bowls . It was sold to JWU
1435 2018-12-09 21:10:44 Just drank a bottle of old engine oil, thankfully the drinkable type and not that from an old engine..
1436 2018-12-09 21:10:39 i want to commission someone to paint me a large oil painting of marluxia as royalty
1437 2018-12-09 21:10:32 Yep! Generous amount of truffle oil and salt too
1438 2018-12-09 21:10:27 Who is going to tell him he’s in the wrong job. Snake oil business is more becoming of him.
1439 2018-12-09 21:10:26 If your family have short hair your chances of having long hair is slim. Your hair growth cycle is shorter than most that’s that’s just that. No oil can save you. Don’t let YouTube fool you.

1441 2018-12-09 21:10:17 @FatKidDeals are there any deals on xl oil diffusers?
1442 2018-12-09 21:10:13 Yes, you right that I know very little about Quebec.  I've been a visitor a few times and it always seemed like Quebeckers are just down-to-earth normal guys and gals that understand common sense. So it's beyond me why shipping Canada's oil through Quebec is an issue?
1443 2018-12-09 21:10:03 Endless oil story
1444 2018-12-09 21:09:44 Derek is changing my oil while he has my car.  bless this man 
1445 2018-12-09 21:09:40 Send your money to me I'll help u
1446 2018-12-09 21:09:38 Yes He is! God is faithful always and He keeps working in my / your favor just believe! Blessings to you Brotha D for keeping your oil ready
1447 2018-12-09 21:09:38 Actually, I explained myself and my issue is not "oil". I know our economy needs Alberta oil. I want to protect our environment, waters and indigenous lands, but I also know pipelines are essential to get our oil to market (trains too slow, not enough rail, too dangerous).
1448 2018-12-09 21:09:37 which essential oil is best for forgetting the pain of existence
1449 2018-12-09 21:09:28 The husband lost his wife and she poured oil on their hinges; there are doors would have begun to the Baba Yaga, bony of
1450 2018-12-09 21:09:22 Small govt is impossible because if you don’t have big govt, you have big pharma, or big oil, etc? Am I reading this right?
1451 2018-12-09 21:09:20 I brought a table lasagne from farm foods (£1).
But I tweaked it by putting grated mature cheddar over the top ten mins from end and Worcester sauce over the cheese.
I did McCain homestyle  chunky chips in olive oil, cracked pepper and Himalayan Salt in the oven.
(not a chef)
1452 2018-12-09 21:09:17 I really hate the way the smell of hot oil sticks to you 
1453 2018-12-09 21:09:13 It’s a hair growth oil I make and sell
1454 2018-12-09 21:09:02 Putting that $4.99 face oil saying ahh yes this is will cure my anxiety
1455 2018-12-09 21:08:51 How many gallons to the mile does an oil tanker do ? How many oil tankers are there in the world ?
1456 2018-12-09 21:08:50 The sad truth is If your family have picky hair then the odds are your hair is naturally picky.  no oil can change that don’t let YouTube fool you.
1457 2018-12-09 21:08:31 Easy to say but the reality is otherwise. If you study the Lagos food industry, someone will buy this oil just as some buy oil used to cook at Owambe parties. There's a market for everything. The akara woman, buns seller, yam seller... Kids will buy, conductor will buy, 
1458 2018-12-09 21:08:14 They're looking for oil
1459 2018-12-09 21:08:11 And doesn't that include oil revenue that doesn't reach the citizens?
1460 2018-12-09 21:07:55 Scottish in would have bankrupted the UK and Scotland would have been very successful, without scotlands oil in the 70s England would already be destitute read the McCrone report Scotland keeps the UK afloat and all debt is accumulated by the UK government and spent in England.
1461 2018-12-09 21:07:52 I went to a wedding last night drank my weight in Hennessy and I'm not hung over today and still made it to my oil change appointment who wants to marry me?
1462 2018-12-09 21:07:46 Nothing beats a bowl of comfort tagliatelle: slowly cooked onion, garlic, bell pepper, then added tinned cherry tomato, black pepper, basil and chilli. Cooked slowly 25 min, finish with lemon zest, then top with parmesan, basil, olive oil.

#Materials and #energy in nature that are essential or useful to humans. Often classified as renewable (#water, #air, #soil, #plants, and wind) or nonrenewable (copper, oil, coal)

1464 2018-12-09 21:07:30 I guess that depends on how you define "politician". A lot of people thought Johnny Cochran was a skilled attorney, too. In both these men, I just saw a lot of two-bit gimmickry...a snake oil con. You have mistaken the worst in people for a politician's skill...
1465 2018-12-09 21:07:24 Hey, the oil and weapons bidness must continue unimpeded
1466 2018-12-09 21:07:23 Sounds like he’s looking for the exit.  And I’m 100% a-okay with this Grifter funneling money from his snake oil supporters.
1467 2018-12-09 21:06:59  continue your face routine but before you put your astringent put some oil in in beard then trace the natural line of your beard. The healthier the hair the more it’ll grow
1468 2018-12-09 21:06:53 It’s okay, I just have two oil drums full of day old jungle juice now. Not to mention 41’s feelings.
1469 2018-12-09 21:06:51 If we lose faslane, it would open up our waters for trade routes and oil exploration. Businesses would be fine.

1471 2018-12-09 21:06:33 When you get a homespun neck-n-shoulder massage with olive oil and end up smelling like a salad - does it count as one of your daily veg?
1472 2018-12-09 21:06:26 Oil sets everything right. :3

1476 2018-12-09 21:06:10 If we burn all the oil and gas we can squeeze out of the ground, we assure the destruction of our environment and will cause the death of all the animala, and create misery and death for ourselves.
1477 2018-12-09 21:06:01 Low price for AB oil is indeed Ottawa's fault. No pipelines! Equalization formula pretends AB has a sales tax. Que $11B transfer payments. BC AB SK zero. Rest of Cda $7B. Sales tax like carbon tax discriminates against the poor and middle class as it takes a larger proportion

RT this 1000 times, show these idiots for who they are
1480 2018-12-09 21:05:15 At some point consumers fell in love with charlatans and purveyors of “snake oil,” as it gave them both an out in accountability for their actions and a chance to believe in a fantasy. Now that mentality is spread in large swaths across their  very narrow views of the world.
1481 2018-12-09 21:05:01 "Flat out wrong"oh geez..must be why Notley changed the royalties, shut down all oil production, refused to push for pipelines the....oh wait.....that stuff didnt happen...just because she has advisors that favour the environment over oil and gas doesnt make the party anti gas
1482 2018-12-09 21:04:57 I’m just sat here folded arms w oil on my scalp complaining at the ceiling
1483 2018-12-09 21:04:53 Ok. Confirmation is out man! I feel so comfortable now
1484 2018-12-09 21:04:47 Zestos is trash and ALWAYS smells like old fryer oil. That chit is NOT a staple in Atlanta.

1486 2018-12-09 21:04:42 Try peppermint oil. I use that and it really helps! A Little bit goes a long way!
1487 2018-12-09 21:04:39 I hope you will find time to read it.  It is very good. I was born & lived in Oklahoma for many years. I watched the oil pumps operate until they didn't.  Never experienced an earthquake that was felt. I moved away in 2005 before the fracking started. Earthquakes felt there now
1488 2018-12-09 21:04:36 I have never had an essential oil in my life and I feel fine. They should call em optional oils.
1489 2018-12-09 21:04:30 fish oil or this cod liver thing was what made my sisters grow taller according to my mom, I took it for like two months but no results so I ultimately gave up on it sigh AM I JUST DESTINED TO BE SHORT I HATE THIS
1490 2018-12-09 21:04:24 1) In conversations I have had with people on the subject of Putin/Russia over the past 2/3 years my thought has been he was maneuvering himself to a position where could impact gas/oil markets enough to engage in economic warfare and profit from it.  I am curious how this fits.
1491 2018-12-09 21:04:21 Trump is a traitor who puts himself above country. Donny has been laundering money for Russian mafia for decades. Sex trafficking, embargoed oil, arms, drugs... I’ll,never understand how my fellow “conservatives” can overlook Trump’s alliance with Putin.
1492 2018-12-09 21:04:01 I'm not a weed guy by any stretch but what about mixing THC oil with alcohol?  Is that even a thing?
1493 2018-12-09 21:03:58 So what do you want to do? Have my kids suffocate because people like you wanted to use oil until that point? Don't expect oil to be what it is now in the next 10 years. It's time to reinvent. There are ways to get energy that we don't understand yet but we will.

1500 2018-12-09 21:03:01 we believe in trade up here unlike the dogmatic Tory idiots that have taken the UK to the brink of disaster...oh and we have huge oil and gas reserves/free education/ prescriptions and a trusted competent Government..but actually feel sorry for many English people just now..

1514 2018-12-09 21:01:15 More so ... make it count in the tax equalization formulas ... it was never part of it ... if oil and gas energy count ... then hydro power should as well .... this scam was ALWAYS rigged in Quebec’s favor since day one
1515 2018-12-09 21:01:14 According to 2014 yoon predictions, oil should be running out in the next few years. How is that looking?
1516 2018-12-09 21:01:13 Nikam I strongly oppose
1517 2018-12-09 21:01:03 I think it's more of a collateral damage to anti-pipeline people who are just anti-oil ecofascists who think we could live without oil tomorrow morning. Legault is WRONG to try to appease to them. Most of all, the vast majority of caq voters are either indifferent or pro-pipeline
1518 2018-12-09 21:00:59 So your green ideas are going to take decades to come operation.  So in the mean time you want us to import oil from countries that oppress there. People’s and we have no control over there environment    If you think these people care about the earth you sadly mistaken
1519 2018-12-09 21:00:48 The oil industry isn’t in the planet, our health, future and ecosystems welfare. Who’s side are you on?
1520 2018-12-09 21:00:45 This is why taxes on gas are going up everywhere its costing more to sustain them every year where as the superior forms costs are declining, because of technological advancements, we've mastered coal and oil and it it's impossible for it to get any more better.

1527 2018-12-09 21:00:19 Using hot wax on the skin opens up the pores, which can often remain open for hours following a wax. To ensure your pores remain clean and free of bacteria and oil, thoroughly cleanse the area before and after a wax, and avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing.

1545 2018-12-09 20:57:54 LMFAO.... Well depending on where you live it can be a multitude of things solar wind hydro nuclear geo thermal oil and or coal. Oil and coal are the most inferior and expensive forms to produce energy, which is why they need to go, they aren't necessary and they suck.
1546 2018-12-09 20:57:50 Melt plastic wrappers together via stove (low heat) to make plastic sheets.

Burn paper to make ash.

Water ash to make lye.

Oil with lye to make soap.

Meat makes soil fertile.

Vegetables turn into vinegar or alcohol when rotten.

Glass & metal in a furnace.

Still have trash?
1547 2018-12-09 20:57:33 Pumping gas, taking my car in for an oil change, folding laundry
1548 2018-12-09 20:57:15 Use patchouli and lavender oil
1549 2018-12-09 20:57:06 the palm oil industry would make that claim
1550 2018-12-09 20:57:05 CBD oil and curcumin, works wonders
1551 2018-12-09 20:57:04 If they refine it, why shouldn't they want to refine Canadian oil, extracted under stringent environmental policies, using Cdn labour, creating Cdn jobs; producing Cdn revenue....while avoiding supertankers with GHG emissions as they bring oil from foreign dictatorships?
1552 2018-12-09 20:57:00 America is exporting more oil than ever before! Check out some of these facts about oil exports.
1553 2018-12-09 20:56:55 *sends christmas list to my parents:
oil change, car detail,pay insurance next month?
1554 2018-12-09 20:56:44 It's important to remember which govt & who caused this mess. NG shut down after approval. Tmx bought to also shut down by regulation & stall tactics. West Coast tanker ban. But only for ones carrying AB oil. C69 which will kill any future pipeline project. The agenda is clear.
1555 2018-12-09 20:56:31 Well, too, there are a number of waivers floating around, for governments currently importing sanctioned Iranian oil. This could be not only a shot across the bow for the Chinese, but also a gentle reminder to others as well.  maybe
1556 2018-12-09 20:56:18 Utter nonsense. Only hope if the world suddenly needed a source of pure snake oil - I am sure you could earn billions from that.
1557 2018-12-09 20:56:15 What a moron. We can trade with the EU and watch English companies flock to Scotland. Parliament will be quick to encourage trade in order to get access to the oil.
1558 2018-12-09 20:56:15 Maybe Saskatchewan and Alberta should concentrate on Growing Food instead of oil
1559 2018-12-09 20:56:13 Uhh, OPEC still controls 40% of the world's oil.
1560 2018-12-09 20:56:10 The more I read up on the PetroJam missing oil the funnier it gets
1561 2018-12-09 20:56:06 The year is 2087. Oil is scarce. Global warming accelerates. A quarterback is hurt. Another is signed. Kaepernick is not consulted. Everyone is racist.
1562 2018-12-09 20:56:02 @jidesanwoolu what's your take on scoping Groundnut oil from the gutter by lagosian?
1563 2018-12-09 20:55:52 Complicated? I'm sure they can manage running oil and grain on the rails together, pretty certain it not rocket science and they have guys that run a schedule effectively.
1564 2018-12-09 20:55:49 Even with all the oil money in the world you will never be as successful as Liverpool Ynwa
1565 2018-12-09 20:55:49 Yes it sucks...even before the Govt take over of industry and oil the average person could barely afford the gas they made.
Their govt always sucked.

1572 2018-12-09 20:54:57 Is it true a completed pipeline means 1 additional tanker a month moving oil out of Vancouver?
1573 2018-12-09 20:54:46 Calculate the price of oil in gold.. it is a store of value.. so is silver.. a 1964 quarter from the US still buys a gallon a gas as it did in 1964..
1574 2018-12-09 20:54:29 Been recommended another oil for my hair. My collection is just growing.

(Anne's oil, anyone know if it's any good???)
1575 2018-12-09 20:54:09 The weak oil price must be hurting bro 
1576 2018-12-09 20:54:02 Something tells me that oil prices may fall as the market opens on Monday. I think Qatar is not going to follow production cut and US may announce its Q1 production for 2019 a little too early

1578 2018-12-09 20:53:48 @RandPaul  Trump violated the 2014 Russian sanctions extended in 2016 by the Obama Administration. He was attempting to do business with a nation globally banned via sanctions. That's why the Exon oil deal had to be scrapped. You seem to speak without thinking.

1582 2018-12-09 20:53:24 Its over 3 dollars a gallon in oil rich arctic state of Alaska. Were being screwed and need to protest pump prices like in France
1583 2018-12-09 20:53:07 I can't afford good parmigiano reggiano or grana padano so no cheese with this pasta... This butter and coconut oil marinara should be ok.. anaa?
1584 2018-12-09 20:52:51 Cars are the obvious low hanging fruit from a technological stand point. The only thing keeping us all from driving EV'S  is the evil oil industry and their terrorist psls of OPEC. EV' should have enjoyed  wide spread adoption 20 years ago.
1585 2018-12-09 20:52:48 This new beard oil got my beard smelling good af ngl
1586 2018-12-09 20:52:44 There are some real supply pressures with accelerating effect in the oil market. Libya continues to be unstable. Saudi making a significant cut November to January and OPEC+ joining in.  China's increasing appetite. Iran waivers expiring. Canada curtailing. Winter is coming #OOTT
1587 2018-12-09 20:52:42 White people just do lame things to peanuts but peanut butter isn't one of them.

We have a comfort food from my husband's family called peanut butter noodles.  It's just cooked Chinese noodles (no egg) dumped in a mixture of peanut butter, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
1588 2018-12-09 20:52:39 Dame I miss Oil but I know I shouldn’t 
1589 2018-12-09 20:52:28 YOU SHOULD 

- Wear a base & top coat polish to protect them

- try to use acetone free polish remover. Never pick polish off

- Rub Vaseline, coconut oil, olive oil, castor oil or aloe Vera on your nails before you sleep to grow them

- File them into a shape consistently

Usually, when someone's opinions are so desperate, it indicates that he is holding a huge bag. 
1591 2018-12-09 20:51:51 Xmas have reached, Oil marketers have ordered their workers to shut down, Fuel scarcity every Xmas.. Whyyyyyyyy????

1592 2018-12-09 20:51:48 The people who scooped the groundnut oil from the gutters are probably busy filtering it and mixing it with the one they have to increase quantity and make profit. 

Why are humans like this?
1593 2018-12-09 20:51:36 Unsuspecting victim: “Hello, my car needs an oil change”

Middle aged Car guy: “what if we gave you a supercharged V8 engine, bullet proof glass with steel plates on top, and I just throw a screwdriver at your radiator”
1594 2018-12-09 20:51:24 It's the last night of Hanukkah, which means I'll be doing...an OIL show, of course! "But Lina! Why aren't you doing a glitter show, like last year?" Because I am OUT OF GLITTER.  Contribute to the Glitter Fund, and you'll get a glitter-tastic Christmas/New Years show! #MFC
1595 2018-12-09 20:51:02 They are very similar to the Lucas oil mods that run on the west coast, and the ICar mods that run in the Midwest. A lot more of the IMCA / Grand American Modified type cars across the country than tour type mods.
1596 2018-12-09 20:50:23 I will buy a candy shop and castor oil 
1597 2018-12-09 20:50:10 Tea tree oil from Dischem. I apply it w my Neutrogena moisturizer and there's such a difference
1598 2018-12-09 20:50:08 No, I put them in pasta a lot, actually, especially if I'm doing an olive oil sauce. One of my favorite vegetables.
1599 2018-12-09 20:49:56 How to end Trump sanctions on importation of oil p….
1600 2018-12-09 20:49:47 I just bought some a few minutes ago. Shallots + pears + mushrooms sautéed in butter/oil + white wine goes very well with butternut squash ravioli. That’s what I’m making tomorrow.
1601 2018-12-09 20:49:39 QC loves Saudi Oil!
1602 2018-12-09 20:49:36 1/When talking about what it takes to clean up oil spills that affect the environment that is measurable. Health insurance companies take into account the careers of individuals & businesses when determining benefits, costs & premiums. As far as cancer & power lines, I read this:
1603 2018-12-09 20:49:34 Idiots  they cut oil and price raise ... yes ? And who a most big exporter of oil in the world? Of course America  Defeat Iranian brains .
1604 2018-12-09 20:49:33 .When #Saddam was cornered, he burned his country (oil fields); When Saddam #Trump is cornered by Mueller & Dems, he’ll try to  burn down America, starting w/ Congress, DOJ, & economy
1605 2018-12-09 20:49:30 So much hatred on all sides.  The blame game is not going to fix anything, EVER.  The elected politicians think they ALL have ALL the answers.  Let us be realistic for a change.  It is impossible to stop using oil all at once.  Renewables are already producing about 67%
1606 2018-12-09 20:49:20 terwijl NL miljarden per jaar weggeeft aan corrupte regimes, #ontwikkelingshulp koopt china- niet gebonden door welk klimaatverdrag dan ook- wereldwijd oliewinning op, met inzet van eigen bedrijven, en wurgcontracten

1621 2018-12-09 20:48:02 .@Beyonce fan here, but putting out “Freedom” in 2016 as a ‘dismantle oppressive systems’ anthem, then endorsing Beto O’Rourke (at the last minute) + now performing the Ambani wedding — $ 41.5 billion net worth from oil refining & petrochemicals— aren’t things that add up for me.
1622 2018-12-09 20:47:45 Would love to but oil guy
1623 2018-12-09 20:47:40 He most likely put too much oil in the pot and it boiled over when he added the fries ... my friend legit did the same this and the stove caught on fire 
1624 2018-12-09 20:47:35 The “Globalists” are who? Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch the international king maker, replacing God with himself one day at a time. Christianity and Trumpism are no more compatible than oil and water.

1630 2018-12-09 20:46:56 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
1631 2018-12-09 20:46:42 I never put oil in my hair bc once when I was 13 or 14 I didn't fully get it out and started crying lmfaoooooo
1632 2018-12-09 20:46:41 Cardboard and Motor Oil, my favorite
1633 2018-12-09 20:46:18 But then oil companies won't be paying tax from their profits. Instead they will pass it on to people you mention living by paychecks. That's vicious capitalism.
1634 2018-12-09 20:46:14 just been massaged and rubbed with oil for two hours, now i‘m soft, satisfied and i smell good. it‘s what she deserves

“International currency!”
Every currency today relies on Eurodollars. Without an alternative, stop arguing this.

1650 2018-12-09 20:44:50 1. Mix some moisturizer with your foundation if you're going for a lighter/more natural look

2. Apply vaseline or castor oil to your eyebrows to make them thicker or to your lashes to make them longer

3. Drink warm lemon water as soon as you wake up every morning, before eating
1651 2018-12-09 20:44:44 If you have any lavender plant or essential oil you can smell that and apply it on your temples. Also just massaging your temples in general helps.

Oil dey there!!!
1654 2018-12-09 20:44:33 Why get off fossil fuels? What part of #climatechange do you not understand? Burning oil creates GHG emissions, no matter where it comes from.
1655 2018-12-09 20:44:21 Are the privileges and the money that good, or do you truly believe all the lies you tell about man-made global warming? If so, how do you sleep at night, knowing you're a disgusting puppet of evil bankers and oil men, trying to enslave humanity in a neo-feudal
dark age?
1656 2018-12-09 20:43:58 If there is a spill in the oil sands, will BC help Alberta?
1657 2018-12-09 20:43:51 I swear it can be the smallest thing, like needing a oil change and I’m like yup time to get a new car
1658 2018-12-09 20:43:45 My trick is to add 4 cloves of garlic and one whole shallot to a canned chicken soup, diced and cooked in olive oil before adding the soup. It's a shot of antimicrobial goodness and the protein helps with healing. Feel better.

1663 2018-12-09 20:42:54 As far as I check recently they still drive car in Quebec. They prefer Saudis oil over Canadian? Maybe Alberta should stop contribution to equalization program?

1667 2018-12-09 20:42:37 In Wheatbelt Australia we had emerging industries like alpaca and emu farming. Suddenly everyone was going to get filthy rich off alpaca wool products and emu oil.

1671 2018-12-09 20:42:00 I saw a video today that groundnut oil spilled and poured inside one gutter like that and people went in and started scooping this oil with the intention to sell it to people.

If your mother or father was among them, tell them I said they are witches and wizards.

1675 2018-12-09 20:41:28 THEY DANCED IN THE STREETS AS THE TWIN TOWERS BURNED! Muslims paraded in the streets of Britain as well. I would say they are the problem. England tried screwing over Israel and did screw over the Assyrians after WW2. Placating Saudis for oil.

Jensen would tell Dean about filling the hula hoop with salt. And maybe oil door on the Impala #SpnJax
1680 2018-12-09 20:40:53 How so? Canada produces its oil to some of the highest enviro standards in the world. Some innovations underway include ghg reductions by up to 80% per barrel are also on the horizon. Better to get it from Canada. Transition to renewables sure but can't overnight.
1681 2018-12-09 20:40:44 Why @UnitedStates , @europeanunion @mercosul @BRICSPolicy @UN are complicent & silent about the horrors of human trafficking in @saudiarabia #Emirades etc? OIL & MONEY. Let men & women be lied by "agents" about a decent job & end up enslaved, raped, beaten, killed. OIL & MONEY!

1684 2018-12-09 20:40:22 America is producing oil like never before. Give Trump some credit.
1685 2018-12-09 20:40:19 Or a 55 gallon oil drum and some aviation fuel.
1686 2018-12-09 20:40:16 Trying to protect his oil block.ode
1687 2018-12-09 20:40:10 I think it's leaking oil. 기름이 새는 것 같아요.

1689 2018-12-09 20:40:06 Oil is headed for a train wreck, which is why we need to build our renewable energy industry up now instead.
1690 2018-12-09 20:39:37 
1691 2018-12-09 20:39:37 Hate using olive oil drops but gotta look after your ears
1692 2018-12-09 20:39:36 I hope he was using protection. Our she could end Up!! a mummy 
1693 2018-12-09 20:39:30 Yes, I can blame them. When they get away with the atrocities that they do, such as oil spills which are often caused by their own negligence.
1694 2018-12-09 20:39:12 Btw the .5 million US oil saving/leak stopping device/machine/thingamajig that years later, now useless, costed 11000 US to test took the cake!
1695 2018-12-09 20:39:09 Please don't eat food products made with palm oil.
1696 2018-12-09 20:39:03 oversold so they got a pop with the multiple but the fundamentals aren’t changing so their relative performance will be limited. Those with large inputs of oil (like SCL which is in a cyclical sector but acts like a counter-cyclical) should do well as relative margins expand. >>
1697 2018-12-09 20:38:40 Start with ramen with an egg swirled in. Maybe some scallions and sesame oil. Ooohhh, a squeeze of lime and some ground pork. Is a sprinkle of crispy fried black rice too much? Def miso... I’d say white and about 2tsps. Spinach cooks down a lot so add more than you think y
1698 2018-12-09 20:38:33 Thing is as an Indy Country we use our initial oil income to rapidly grow and develop renewables. This is where our future energy wealth lies. Huge expanses of sea for wave power, huge expanse for wind.
1699 2018-12-09 20:38:26 That’s simply not going to happen when oil is priced at $50/barrel.  No incentive.
1700 2018-12-09 20:38:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.

1702 2018-12-09 20:37:57 近年、保証会社を通らないと言うことは、住の選択肢を著しく狭める事になる。
大家としては前払とか貰えれば入居を考えても良いのだが、管理業者が受けない。なぜなら賃貸管理業務のうち督促や強制退去などは保証会社にアウトソースしてるから。保証会社を通さないと業務が増えるのだ。やらんわな。
1703 2018-12-09 20:37:51 The Pakistan LNG Limited has cancelled a crucial shipment of the liquefied petroleum gas (LNG) that will not only cause a shortage of gas during winter – to the benefit of furnace oil mafia –  but will also cause a loss of Rs12 billion to  the national exchequer.
1704 2018-12-09 20:37:46 Data is the new oil, and China is the new Saudi ~ Kai-Fu Lee
1705 2018-12-09 20:37:43 We bought it because the current government kept moving the goal posts for approval. They would rather spend countless amounts of money on foreign oil. Which is completely ridiculous. And they are inching closer and closer to being a socialist regime.
1706 2018-12-09 20:37:42 But there is nothing bad in allocating oil blocks to individuals base on their influence in government and which will only serves their selfish interest?
1707 2018-12-09 20:37:24 CBD oil is the bomb! As someone who has fibromyalgia pain, it's heavenly. But yeah, unless a kid has a painful condition, they don't need to be vaping.
1708 2018-12-09 20:37:22 “Data is the new oil”
1709 2018-12-09 20:37:10 The North is holding back the country as they can't think beyond the oil in the Eastern region.
1710 2018-12-09 20:37:09 One oil light comes on and grounds my @Qantas flight indefinitely in Albury whilst Rex flights take off all around us.

Not the ideal start to a Monday from Australia's premier airline.

1712 2018-12-09 20:37:03 You've said a lot that is great in the thread so will just respond to this one -- I haven't worked this out in my head but, what if gasoline for consumers were free or deeply subsidized during the transition & subsidies to oil and gas companies ended?
1713 2018-12-09 20:37:00 Where is Phillip Paulwell in all of this ? The report goes 5years back. How much will he pay back. Luckily a cake could be identified. Who's gonna refund over 5billion dollars  for the stolen oil we purchase from illegal gas stations.
1714 2018-12-09 20:36:59 At least the chain oil won't show on them
1715 2018-12-09 20:36:56 LOL...not one way to skin a cat!
Tech Success is scarce and SARS are oblivious to it. When tech success is common, every side effects (SARS) will be gone. Do they harass oil marketers? They don't know that it's possible to genuinely make money online. That's why

1717 2018-12-09 20:36:45 The villain in Spy Fox 3 is literally destroying the environment for profit. Bit close to home there, eh? (Though, it may have been inspired by oil companies' behaviour up to the point... was it known by 2001?)
1718 2018-12-09 20:36:40 Only people who should be blamed for the situation ab is in are the successive conservative governments that squandered their people resource and gave the proceeds to oil execs
1719 2018-12-09 20:36:33 Data is the new oil!
1720 2018-12-09 20:36:23 who else eats their pancakes with motor oil now
1721 2018-12-09 20:36:18 If data is the new oil, China is the new Saudi Arabia. Discuss.
1722 2018-12-09 20:36:08 @lizbsmith11 look into Black Seed Oil for MRSA!
1723 2018-12-09 20:36:07 We are well over 12" here in WS, NC

Thankfully,  still with power and the heating oil topped off before the storm 
1724 2018-12-09 20:36:00 i went to walmart to get oil for my car & i said to a hot ass employee “can i put oil in my car without a funnel” & he said “yes, but would you like me to do it?” Yes please dad
1725 2018-12-09 20:35:47 And Bob give me an explanation why, the US has secured all of Syria oil field, with bases surrounding the region.... Have placed sanctions on countries supplying oils to Syria?? While the Russians are delivering food and medical supplies.... Not on MSM...
1726 2018-12-09 20:35:42 I can see everyone is clicking on this story 
....what are my followers like !!
1727 2018-12-09 20:35:28 The Edmonton Oil Kings Teddy Bear Toss event last night was unbelievable. Incredible atmosphere!
1728 2018-12-09 20:35:27 I need to step my essential oil game up
1729 2018-12-09 20:35:21 Not sure, USA $21T #NatioalDebt rising at over $1.2T yr, w/ 105% #DebttoGDPratio, isn't sustainable. Also domino effect if Italy, Greece, UK, EU or other economies collapse under high debt b/c ALL #fiatcurrencies intertwined on same credit system. Iran war over oil could tip USA.
1730 2018-12-09 20:35:01 Is Saudi producing more oil in hopes that the world forgets they are terrorists and murderers?
1731 2018-12-09 20:34:52 Go on amazon (or anywhere really) and get Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I rub it on mine every night and I promise it’s done wonders, they have grown sooo much faster and thicker 
1732 2018-12-09 20:34:42 Trump cares not about gas prices.  Let's be clear this was to enrich himself, keeping Saudi money funneling into the Trump family.  The Saudi's only pump more oil to hurt competitors from other countries.  What they do bares little on the real projections of oil futures.
1733 2018-12-09 20:34:39 So you’re quite happy about importing your oil from Saudi Arabia are you?? Are you happy with cities along the St. Lawrence dumping their raw sewage!!
1734 2018-12-09 20:34:38 Its safer that way if they cant manage the oil and the environment that brings them health and wealth causing mass exodus of its population to foreign countries can they manage the artfacts? Sad but the bitter truth
1735 2018-12-09 20:34:31 I'm broke, don't work till Wednesday and desperately need an oil change

1740 2018-12-09 20:34:05 All boards ripped to size. Did I mention the trees were in our yard? Now cut a bit long and two coats of clear penetrating oil. Penetrating my brain cells, but I have a big exhaust fan.
1741 2018-12-09 20:33:47 Don’t whales live in “ the ocean”?  What impact does raw sewage have on them or don’t you care so long as it isn’t oil?
1742 2018-12-09 20:33:41 Preferably with the tiniest bit of olive oil in the bottom of the skillet. In Texas they just put them directly on the burners, since the stoves there use natural gas.
1743 2018-12-09 20:33:39 Gargling with salt water followed by oregano oil helps me considerably. But if you want to take your medicine, who am I to tear you away from a good torturous time?
1744 2018-12-09 20:33:30  just sorted him some beard oil as a little stocking filler. 
1745 2018-12-09 20:33:26 Look at the metrics for employment numbers.

Job creation is subsidized.

Oil prices are a crisis (although not her fault).

What else you got?
1746 2018-12-09 20:33:09 Yeah, better shot, but still just depends if they could get on a team that would utilize their tools. I think they were more like Davis Webb. I'm enjoying what Mahomes is doing, but holding onto my anointing oil until I see whether defenses catch up with him next year.
1747 2018-12-09 20:33:08 We would be exporting from Leith and Greenock collecting our own taxes for Whiskey for a start, our own stock exchange again for our oil and gas 
1748 2018-12-09 20:33:08 ما تخافي علينا نحن مع الله أقوى من الكل
1749 2018-12-09 20:33:07 It would be cheaper for Alberta & Sask to give equalization to Manitoba and we can build a pipeline to Hudson Bay and get our oil to market there. Problem solved!!
1750 2018-12-09 20:32:48 The tmx right now is how the whole lower mainland gets it's oil products. 300k bpd is less than 10% of what Alberta produces.
1751 2018-12-09 20:32:47 My dog drank some cooking oil. She now pukes all over the flat. Called the vet. She'll live.

 I have oil stains on all floor boards she has puked on. #miserabledogs

1759 2018-12-09 20:32:08 the freakin world is oil dependant.  do we need to find a real solution absolutely, but the taxing without a plan is no plan. please explain how we pay for healthcare, education and now the incredible interest on debt we now have if we do not utilize our natural resources.
1760 2018-12-09 20:32:05 Ban tankers on the St. Lawrence and the Atlantic too. Québec burns Saudi Oil and Equalization dollars. Time to turn off the NG valve. Sure Quebec will be fine with all their surplus hydro power. #cdnpoli

1764 2018-12-09 20:31:39 Yeah, and the CEO of ExxonMobil complaining about Trump "wanting" to do illegal things...when Big Oil complains about illegality, then it must really be something.
1765 2018-12-09 20:31:36 Okay thats what ima do cause i dont wanna buy one and cant get the oil carts for it thats gone defeat my whole purpose of getting one you know when i could’ve stuck to my actual trees and leaf lol
1766 2018-12-09 20:31:03 Withdraw to Herat and allow Persia to "liberate" the rest of the country.  Inside 6 months they will feel like they are being boiled in oil while covered in ants.
1767 2018-12-09 20:31:02 Yeah, it does. Oil, land, agriculture, all that. It damn sure ain't flat tummy tea and mixtape covers

1774 2018-12-09 20:30:12 Yeah, I've seen videos on growing turmeric and already have lavender seeds, as I use lavender oil for my asthma. Oregano is a great natural antibiotic so that's another thing to grow.
1775 2018-12-09 20:30:09 The study just said "Oil companies don't spend enough towards charities that clean our oceans - this is a $800 million subsidy from the government". Noooope lol no it is not.

1780 2018-12-09 20:29:52 I remember in the '60's that the doom and gloomers were saying that we would run out of oil in 30 years....so much for the "expert"
1781 2018-12-09 20:29:49 But more importantly,increase in productivity by the palm oil industry shouldn't come at the expense of protecting biodiversity and the environment as well as assuring host communities that their rights and access to land is protected.
1782 2018-12-09 20:29:21 For all the libtards out there, driving an electric car is not as green as you think. What produces that electricity? Power plants which use coal and oil to produce that electricity. Whenever you charge your car you are still partaking in the burning of fossil fuels.
1783 2018-12-09 20:29:19 Just watched this!  I was nervous for you when you put on that oil!  Then you said it was burning and I was all ohhh daaaang

1786 2018-12-09 20:29:06 “In a typical month, the amount of waste water generated by the fracking process in New Mexico, the country’s third-largest producer of oil, would be enough to fill Elephant Butte, the state’s largest lake.”

1791 2018-12-09 20:29:01 Well then LC should stop spouting conspiracy theories and spreading lies  e.g. big pharma, big seed oil, big grain, Ancel Keys cherry picking, etc, etc. Maybe it would be taken seriously if they stuck to the science and stopped talking BS.
1792 2018-12-09 20:29:00 How much is crude oil price now. We are selling oil price now close to when PDP sold. So what foundation are they laying.
1793 2018-12-09 20:28:40 Leonor Greyl oil (great for dry ends) and the amika conditioner
1794 2018-12-09 20:28:38 No average jo shit around here Charlie. The oil field money messed my head up as far as knowing the money I wanna see coming in.
1795 2018-12-09 20:28:35 Fuck all these slippery, weed oil soaked handed wide receivers.
1796 2018-12-09 20:28:34 @senmarcorubio  It seems extremely likely that Trump has promised a pardon to Manafort, just like he may have promised the Crown Prince no actions on the Khashoggi murder, if he releases some oil to lower gas prices to make Trump look good.
1797 2018-12-09 20:28:22 Good god Patrick do you really think before you speak. In Calgary alone big oil companies throw an exorbitant amount of money at technology and educational institutes just check with Sait and the University of Calgary and see how much money they've contributed
1798 2018-12-09 20:28:09 I imagine Iran also has a lot of oil. #LestWeForgetPalestine

1800 2018-12-09 20:27:56 Y’all want oil for #BOTE  let me know
1801 2018-12-09 20:27:52 Another one: "Deduction for Tertiary Injectants – allows companies to deduct the costs of fluids, gases, and other chemicals used for enhanced oil recovery from existing wells"

Why would a drilling company not expense their cost of production? This study is ridiculous.
1802 2018-12-09 20:27:48 The Mayor should not be shocked. This is Liberal retaliation against Notley for challenging the Feds on oil pipelines. Libs are small minded.
1803 2018-12-09 20:27:46 There's one specific person claiming to be a socialist for Beto that says Beto should accept BIG OIL money since that's a big industry in Texas! Don't think he's real socialist.....
1804 2018-12-09 20:27:46 as much as current industry relies on it, oil is not necessary for food nor an economy. Subsidize renewables as oil is now subsidized and alternate tech will replace oil's role. many can afford downsizing. backyard food never hurts, localizing needs & economy best for resilience.
1805 2018-12-09 20:27:41 Ma,
We're almost there Ma! At sundown we'll have once again defended against the onslaught of Santa's legions. The trench of boiling oil held fast. Murray always overcooked latkes, like greasy stones, were perfect for our slings after our gelt ran low.   #lettersfromthewaronXmas

1811 2018-12-09 20:26:47 Went through similar around this time last year, lack of daylight was a contributing factor but not the main one, and using an SAD lamp helped regulate that a bit. Would recommend the oil, noting to lose apart from the outlay.
1812 2018-12-09 20:26:32 @SairKhan was it dōTERRA fractionated coconut oil  that you used in the @imacelebrity jungle? 
1813 2018-12-09 20:25:59 Medium-term: through PIB, government grows its revenue by gradual increase in oil and gas production; disposes off unprofitable holdings. Revenue increase accelerates spending on electricity, rail, road, port, airport, dam and other infrastructure.
1814 2018-12-09 20:25:50 Oil and natural gas are the past, #GreenCoal is the future 
1815 2018-12-09 20:25:50 It’s a headline every time a wingnut opens their mouth. There seems to be a huge turn against Alberta by the rest of Canada who seem to enjoy our recession as “deserved” because oil is easy to pile on against. Reporting stupid separatist opinions is part of it too.
1816 2018-12-09 20:25:47 You won’t be off. Your dreaming. How can you join the EU with your debt to gdp and needing subsidies for oil collapse. Just that single piont alone. You will accept the euro ? Your be more broke than Greece.
1817 2018-12-09 20:25:44 Best. Cookware. Ever. 

Well, except for the ancient cast iron skillet I have. Seasoned so well, it’s like looking into a pool of oil.
1818 2018-12-09 20:25:39 So easy - raw sprouts, washed and chopped in half. Douse in sesame oil and a dash of balsamic, roast on 200 for 15 mins, bring them out, toss them around, sprinkle with sesame seeds, back in the over for another 10-15 mins, depending on how crispy you want them.
1819 2018-12-09 20:25:34 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
1820 2018-12-09 20:25:32 I love swimming in the ocean, but the salt and sun fucked up my hair. I found that L'Oréal Paris Elvive Extraordinary Oil Oil-in-Cream Leave in cream worked wonders in restoring my hair to a healthy glow and bounce
1821 2018-12-09 20:25:31 Nothing. Israel is surely a sworn enemy of Iran. So is the USA. Iran has lots of oil. Plus middle eastern brown skin ... Josh wouldn't need anything more than that. #LestWeForgetPalestine
1822 2018-12-09 20:25:29 Pourquoi « presque » ?
1823 2018-12-09 20:25:25 One of the most underrated parts the country.   People who think all West Texas is cotton fields and oil rigs are sorely mistaken.
1824 2018-12-09 20:25:23 he LOVES taking oil money. thanks for speaking truth to power!
1825 2018-12-09 20:25:15 Ok a lot of people shit on CBD oil BUT I have noticed a massive difference in myself I’ve been using it for 2 months started on 2.75 now on 5% and normally I’d need a bucket of rescue remedy in busy crowds/shops/airports and I was graaaand all weekend
1826 2018-12-09 20:25:14 lavender essential oil mixed with my moisturizer is the best decision I’ve made this year
1827 2018-12-09 20:25:13 Do you have wegmans down by you? I’m always perusing their olive oil & random sauce aisle. Honestly I’m a slut for wegmans in general
1828 2018-12-09 20:24:50 I don't know about you, but tea tree oil makes my scalp worse.  Have you tried using any oils at all?  I'm not talking a fancy oil blend or anything like that - I've found almond oil is the right fit for me.
1829 2018-12-09 20:24:46 Oil tank/smoker came out of there, we've seen a bit, isn't the Rayburn down there?
1830 2018-12-09 20:24:38 WEATHER IS NOT CLIMATE.
1831 2018-12-09 20:24:32 Hey #BigOil losers.

Just a heads up.

You want to come and have a convo ?

Fine.

If you come into my timeline uninvited, and call me names or stupid, or ;

- the usual arrogance of "stop using oil then".

- tell the same statistical lie as Notley...

You'll be blocked or muted.
1832 2018-12-09 20:24:20 He would only get one for his woman. *chuckles* dobt get him ideas or he would evebtually do so and i dont want to be cleaning oil and neddles at home. I have enough to clean already there
1833 2018-12-09 20:23:50 Are you suggesting oil and coal couldn't possibly ever have an agenda to prevent competition? The only people putting evidence out against UNLIMITED energy supplies are in the pocket of oil and coal.
1834 2018-12-09 20:23:49 oil no go help. in fact i prefer natural lubricants. na the chest i wan put oil ni. even if i suck the breast sef e go be like say i dey suck petrol hoes
1835 2018-12-09 20:23:48 find ways to do small nice things for yourself.

when i was broke i got creative. a dollar store candle + food stamp items like oil & salt == a relaxing bath.

now time is more precious. so stealing 1 min here & there for sit-ups & yoga stretches. just any tiny thing can be 
1836 2018-12-09 20:23:42 Oil dey ur head
1837 2018-12-09 20:23:42 I forgot to put oil my hair so now my hair is beyond frizzy and ugly.
1838 2018-12-09 20:23:39 Canadians are about to boil over.

>Destruction of our border
>Destruction of our oil and gas
>Destruction of our culture 
>Destruction of our speech rights
>Tomorrow, Destruction of our Sovereignty

Canadians are sick of it, and had enough. 

#Canada #Cdnpoli #Onpoli
1839 2018-12-09 20:23:36 Okay..oil ready for Monday morming mama-put delicacy.
1840 2018-12-09 20:23:34 Holy. You do realize that the oil sands are a naturally occurring event, that trees are stunted, and rivers have a sheen of oil due to mother nature’s design. Due to reclamation after the mine is done, mother nature’s mess is actually cleaned up. Research it. #sheep
1841 2018-12-09 20:23:31 1- use coconut oil before showering, it will hidrate your hair (don’t do it daily).

2-try not to buy the same shampoo.

3-cut if it is burnt (just in case is needed).

4-don’t brush it too much.

5-try to use natural products.
1842 2018-12-09 20:23:25 demikian beberapa status yang saya buat pada hari Senin 10 Desember 2018, pukul 04.21 WITA menggunakan komputer oil movement.
1843 2018-12-09 20:23:16 I will be thinking of everyone tonight as I am enjoying the BOA at Rogers tonight Lolo am seeing a 5-2 oil win
1844 2018-12-09 20:23:08 Oil needed to be filtered too. I could just smell the burnt chicken.
1845 2018-12-09 20:23:02 @lisamurkowski Sen. Murkowski, please use your positive influence to prevent opening ANWR to oil and gas drilling. Allowing this change will destroy some of the last remaining natural lands in the United States, plus the potential to greatly worsen climate change for all. Thanks
1846 2018-12-09 20:22:59 I’ve been told cats don’t like the smell of orange. So I’m going to try putting orange oil in a spray bottle with water and spraying the tree before I decorate
1847 2018-12-09 20:22:57 tRumpers will tell us they oil their bulldozers with liberal tears and wipe them down with butterfly wings. Deplorable is too weak a word for tRumpers. Who will chain themselves to the bulldozers to prevent this BS? I do not want my tax dollars going toward ruining the planet.
1848 2018-12-09 20:22:54 just a little bit of Oil and Natural Gas but they're totally green
1849 2018-12-09 20:22:49 Again they’re not talking about the transfer payments as an issue. They’re just pointing out how much of a hypocrite they are for accepting transfer payments but against oil. And their solution is a boycott on QC products, as essentially QC has done to #aboil
1850 2018-12-09 20:22:46 i’m a slut for tasty olive oil
1851 2018-12-09 20:22:23 Not connected,  just thought interesting.  WFB Sr. was from Washington, Tx; the family oil business was in Mexico, until it was nationalized.
1852 2018-12-09 20:22:22 Ooooh, I kinda just eyeball everything. These are approximate:
1 lb ground pork
1/2 lb prawns, chopped
~8 shiitake mushrooms, thinly sliced
1 T grated ginger
3 cloves minced garlic
2 finely sliced scallions
3 T chopped cilantro
2 T soy sauce
1 T rice vinegar
1 T sesame oil
S&P
1853 2018-12-09 20:22:22 Any oil on the Rez?
1854 2018-12-09 20:22:19 Even if climate change doesn't exist the transition to renewable energies makes more sense than continued use of a LIMITED supply of energy.  Clean energy is becoming cheaper and is already more economically sound, plus its creates vastly more jobs then coal and oil EVER could.
1855 2018-12-09 20:22:18 It's our oil and it should stay in the USA! Dummies
1856 2018-12-09 20:22:15 only if u oil it up
1857 2018-12-09 20:22:02 Yeah they just got gassed about the money they were making from oil, decided to go all gung ho on it and spunked their money up the wall rather than actually building infrastructure. That's not socialism, its kinda similar to the behavioir new labour pre crash tbh.
1858 2018-12-09 20:21:38 Hmmm somebody that will drink one full bottle of anoint oil.
1859 2018-12-09 20:21:25 With a bit of oil drilling on the side...
1860 2018-12-09 20:21:22 we would need your brother's super suit to move it and out of the house. We could pay to be offical tree decorator *laughs* then he could clean up afterwords. Could he be swayed with beard oil?
1861 2018-12-09 20:20:57 @mikebrewer I just acquired a 2003 Mercedes-Benz 500SL top works perfect has all maintenance records. Needs the suspension rebuilt. Only 46k miles. Southern car. Looks great. Needs your help Savannah Ga. No oil leaks runs strong.
1862 2018-12-09 20:20:50 bio oil & coconut oil. although stretch marks are hereditary so you can’t really “prevent” them but using things people listed will definitely help them not be as bad! and also they will go away over time
1863 2018-12-09 20:20:47 I use Jamaican mango n lime: Castor Oil (coconut) for my locs. Smells amazing. There’s different flavors like Lavender, etc
1864 2018-12-09 20:20:41 I think we are in for inflation, not deflation. Been saying that since 2016.
Last real deflation was oil from circa 140 to 25.
1865 2018-12-09 20:20:33 Are you saying it isn’t a mess now? Even less money for people, less jobs, and higher taxes. How is this a successful anything? Notley campaigned against oil, not that it’s an election year she suddenly is a fighter for it?  her actions have directly contributed to AB problems
1866 2018-12-09 20:20:23 But where did that start from? One of my followers said oil so that makes sense
1867 2018-12-09 20:20:19 Hemp oil is ridiculously good
1868 2018-12-09 20:20:16 That’s so weird, she hasn’t unblocked y’all maybe she just hasn’t found the right essential oil for pettiness yet. 
1869 2018-12-09 20:20:14 I go between Not Your Mother's Naturals (Tahitian Gardenia and Mango Butter) and Mane 'n Tail deep moisturizing.  I also use almond oil once a week on my scalp since it's so dry.
1870 2018-12-09 20:20:07 Putin to Buy Oil with a Cryptocurrency? Is This a Smoke-Screen or a New Era in Financial Geopolitics?
1871 2018-12-09 20:19:46 Just a little oil would help
1872 2018-12-09 20:19:44 ...they are though?  They have a very extensive network of electric car charging stations, they are testing out electric buses, they are electrifying trains, and they are investing heavily in public transport and cycling.  They don't extract oil, but they sure do refine it.
1873 2018-12-09 20:19:40 Agree! Olive oil does wonders for my hair.
1874 2018-12-09 20:19:26 Take a look at the caliber of people scooping this oil... poverty isn’t only in their looks, it’s also in their brains... this isn’t a Nigerian problem, it’s a “people with poverty mentality” problem.
This can only happen in certain parts of Lagos and it’s such a pity
1875 2018-12-09 20:19:26 The transfer payments wouldn’t make up for all the losses from the boycott, and certain uproar would change the minds of the folks against canadain oil
1876 2018-12-09 20:19:18 Reversing is fools gold. All we can do is mitigate. I don't deny what you're saying. But looking on the individualist level is foolish. To combat climate change we need to change how powerful institutions work & which ones exist. Oil companies, for example, should cease to exist
1877 2018-12-09 20:19:15 Those dressing more than likely have seed oils in it.. probably soybean oil and that’s no good for you.. and craisins are just dried sugar really...
1878 2018-12-09 20:19:11 I'll bring you some Homemade chicken soup, Garlic bread & some Hot body Oil 
1879 2018-12-09 20:19:10 Vitamin E oil
1880 2018-12-09 20:19:09 What is wrong with these motherfuckers? Every last one of them should be beaten unconscious and dumped in an oil field.
1881 2018-12-09 20:19:04 it took 15qts of oil for the F350 , some of y’all can’t even do an oil change on an in-line 4
1882 2018-12-09 20:18:58 The problem with over dependence on oil is that when the commodity cycle enters its bear market phase, which can be exaggerated by political dick swinging, the revenue for oil decreases with the price, so the government can't afford it's budget and needed to cut public spending.
1883 2018-12-09 20:18:56 Or without putting oil in it and getting it serviced from time to time. It will  real down and bits will start to fail.
1884 2018-12-09 20:18:56 Like the oilly

1886 2018-12-09 20:18:49 Forgot how good this true life story is. — watching Lorenzo's Oil
1887 2018-12-09 20:18:40 Lol yes and oil and gas are good for ppl on global warming. Amazon is good on labor. Chamber of commerce on healthcare. Pharma on drug prices. You’re picking and choosing on one side and ignoring the other entirely then turning back to idealism to avoid comparison of realities.
1888 2018-12-09 20:18:35 an hour and a half to get an oil change, i don't think so, not today Satan. we'll try again tomorrow.
1889 2018-12-09 20:18:28 Today I experimented with the vegetables for Christmas dinner, and I'm pleased to announce that roasted sprouts with sesame oil and balsamic, and maple and liquid smoked parsnips will be gracing the table.
1890 2018-12-09 20:18:17 Scary when you also realize that oil companies are in charge of the nuclear button AND nuclear war would increase both oil demand and prices.
1891 2018-12-09 20:18:13 It was founded on huge oil and gas reserves.
1892 2018-12-09 20:18:12 And your insistence on lying and selling snake oil to the public that has made a 2nd ref a credible option again.
1893 2018-12-09 20:18:09 Its used for hair care, massage, and also as glycerine, works like tissue oil.
1894 2018-12-09 20:17:59 maybe he is on my list?
1895 2018-12-09 20:17:55 It really blows my mind that given the climate crisis ALONE, you think pragmatism is the answer.

Again: we tried that already. It was, and still is, a huge failure. Nobody drilled more oil than Obama, and he BRAGGED about it. That’s what pragmatism delivers. Slow disaster.
1896 2018-12-09 20:17:52 Une période noire qui va faire se barrer un max de capitaux français et étrangers et une période d'environ 30 ans où tu regretteras les hausses du gas oil de 10 centimes dans la mesure où il sera alors rationné.
1897 2018-12-09 20:17:49 IS THIS THECSAME EXPERTS WHO SAID WE HAD NO OIL LEFT
THE UNIONIST EXPERTS PLAYING FUN AND GAMES
TRYING TO UNDERMINE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT
AND MAKE THEM RUN OUT OF FUNDS
THEREBY GIVING RED AN BLUE TORIES
AN EXCUSE TO BLAME ALL APART FROM THEMSELVES
1898 2018-12-09 20:17:40 Actually, no.

Combustion based energy is a lame horse. 

Of course it's true that oil and gas has been a driver of the Canadian economy. The business is in decline, and many Canadians want to switch support from propping up a dying sector to aiding transition to clean energy.
1899 2018-12-09 20:17:40 No better feeling then a full tank of gas and an oil change
1900 2018-12-09 20:17:25 I'm sorry but is it just me or are people scooping the oil from a DIRTY GUTTER???????
1901 2018-12-09 20:17:04 Wake UP people you all are being SCREWED by a Racist Snake oil salesman . And he’s laughing all the way to the bank .
1902 2018-12-09 20:17:02 Cbd oil has changed my life
1903 2018-12-09 20:16:59 Yoga!also more cayenne cinnamon tumeric, oregano oil oh yeah and WATER!
1904 2018-12-09 20:16:47 I'm almost 70. I'm part of the Woodstock generation. I'm talking about the ones' that were fanatical about the environment even then. They spouted no drilling, no oil, no cars,..etc. I do apologize for not being more specific.
1905 2018-12-09 20:16:42 Same reds and pinks can stain like that, try something oil based and that might help!

1910 2018-12-09 20:16:18 #ukok LSE Newboy . Speak for your self. I am not on anything . As for speaking the truth around about 80 oil tankers on film do that for me from #Horsehill so far, with plenty more to come. Much to your displeasure greenie.

The only one with a fork tongue is you . Get off the bb
1911 2018-12-09 20:16:10 @realDonaldTrump I live in the other hemisphere, in a country where we don't have oil wells. So ideally, I shouldn't be bothered by what this guy says. But I just can't ignore. This is so disheartening to see. I don't understand how this guy is still sitting on the highest...
1912 2018-12-09 20:16:08 We will be fair, just, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
1913 2018-12-09 20:16:06 It’s under 500 millions !! This shouldn’t be news! Wake me up when the whole 50 billions worth of trade is done with local currencies, or at least the whole Oil trade between the two countries.

i'm putting on galoons of baby oil but the magis isn't working
1916 2018-12-09 20:15:50 omg every time i use pepperment oil my cat makes the cutest little scrunched up face cuz of the scent 
1917 2018-12-09 20:15:39 With this be a hardcore, falls-count-anywhere, naked baby oil match?
1918 2018-12-09 20:15:38 @Valvoline i came in for an oil change and left with a fucking chunk of paint missing off my door handle 
1919 2018-12-09 20:15:36 They can’t move away from oil, without utilizing oil to either fund the programs and/or build the products required to create the technology to move away from oil. So short sighted and ignorant.
1920 2018-12-09 20:15:21 Isn't what @jkenney is proposing when he wants to take out the oil revenues from Equalization payments? Time for another constitutional round up 
1921 2018-12-09 20:14:59 Changed my breaks, oil and battery by myself... youtube is life
1922 2018-12-09 20:14:30 They are not investing in alternatives. They do not produce oil.  All Alberta wants/needs to do is ship its own oil (A.K.A. as Canadian Oil) through Quebec, mostly underground, in order to get the oil to market. No different than airplanes flying to Nfld must cross Quebec!
1923 2018-12-09 20:14:26 maybe u can find some kinda hair oil stuff to just rub into the ends when they need it?? i sometimes but that if they start looking sad and its a GIFT
1924 2018-12-09 20:14:24 complete bubble.  Stop using oil and we will stop pulling it out of the ground. All you do by stopping a pipe line is cost every single Canadian money. The world wants cheap energy, they'll just get it somewhere else.
1925 2018-12-09 20:14:22 Still cant beat USA & allies who fucked whole middle east for some oil
1926 2018-12-09 20:14:09 no, no. Im asking u what is it specifically that inhibited growth in other areas. 'Fossil fuel companies incentivised dependence' isn't a good or accurate answer. and specifically what was it about lots of revenue from oil sales that fucked their country..
1927 2018-12-09 20:13:48 Add one more question: Why is gas suddenly so cheap? Today I paid $1.91 in TX. Why did Saudis increase supply and oil costs drop? 
Every time I pump gas it’s a reminder that some DO put a price on a human life...and the old saying “silence can be bought” comes to mind.

1931 2018-12-09 20:12:58 Nay, it’ll cost you too much. Immunity boost: ginger, lemon, cayenne, echinacea, a lil Apple to cut the flavor. Turmeric is also a great add in. On top of all of that, Oil of oregano is bomb.
1932 2018-12-09 20:12:46 Opinions matter.  Just as yours does. I totally believe you think we no longer need the money from oil.
1933 2018-12-09 20:12:39 WE ARE:  Norway++ with no oil/gas to super-inflate peeps' standard of living.  

Oh, the 'farness' of Canada; and the cuckoo-clockness of Die Swish

1935 2018-12-09 20:12:12 Oh cuz they cook it in the same oil as the fish - this was at harbour lights btw
1936 2018-12-09 20:12:10 ps: I'm not opposed to more extreme measures, we do need various harsh measures done at once. We can't stop extracting/buying carbon overnight, though. Imagine how many people would be stranded due to a sudden increase in oil price and lack of availability.
1937 2018-12-09 20:12:09 Go look at Trump's last 2 tweets about oil. WTI moved up after his tweets. His first 2-3 tweets on oil tanked the market. He lost his touch. Mkt no longer cares about his tweets. OPEC didn't even discuss him at the meeting. That's what matters most. No influence over oil now.
1938 2018-12-09 20:11:58 Ron the real story is the massive increase in domestic Oil production in the US.  Trump wants the price low and that's bad for Alberta.

1940 2018-12-09 20:11:51 Oil and gas are the ones offering jobs in the state because other companies can't be bothered. Not defending just stating facts.
1941 2018-12-09 20:11:48 If we were focused on revenge Saudi Arabia would be where the war is. It was all about oil and gas from day 1.
1942 2018-12-09 20:11:44 We are greatly investing in renewables. There will be a time when we’re no longer dependent on oil but until then, we need a practical way to get it from A to B.
1943 2018-12-09 20:11:33 He thinks he can replace oil with renewables John, and he's deadly serious. He doesn't care if thousands are poor or die. His ideology, Marxist in strain, says "eggs have to broken to create an omlette', he is that bad, And GM Butts pushes him further. This climate scare is crap.
1944 2018-12-09 20:11:29 Oil is better than lotion
1945 2018-12-09 20:11:29 @CPolF5 A quand une invitation de @JMJancovici @OIL_MEN ou @GaelGiraud_AFD pour expliquer que la croissance c'est terminée ? #peakoil #MondeFini #ClimateAlarm #GiletsJaunes #NoSolution
1946 2018-12-09 20:11:15 In Belgium there's a supermarket that sells one with sunflower oil instead. But as far as I know it's the only one in the country.

1948 2018-12-09 20:11:05 Raw diet great for yr dog, especially his jaw, gums, teeth. Add a little olive oil and you’ll see his coat shine. I feed my dog raw once a day in am. In pm he gets fresh/frozen  vegetables(broccoli, cauliflower,carrots) steamed, then I drizzle with olive oil, add some cheese?too
1949 2018-12-09 20:11:02 1/ The basic math of my health:
SUBTRACT sugar, grains, seed oils, eating at night, & stress.

ADD avocados, bacon, beef, butter, dark chocolate, eggs, nuts, olive oil, salt, & supplements (magnesium & COQ10)

MULTIPLY sunshine, long walks outside, & sleep.
1950 2018-12-09 20:10:53 Third world corrupt country swimming in oil money. Wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole. Repressive human rights.
1951 2018-12-09 20:10:50 Chris, Labour is the wrong horse. Only a completely batshit voting system could give them a majority. With McDonnell promising to support the oil and gas industry, what future do we have left?

1953 2018-12-09 20:10:37 Ybn almighty jay told blac chyna that her pussy need an oil change

1955 2018-12-09 20:10:26 ACAB! ACAB! Oil! Oil! Oi!
1956 2018-12-09 20:10:24 As Canadians we're all shareholders in the energy industry.

Our country would be a vastly different place if it weren't for oil and gas extraction, and it wouldn't be good.

President Buhari.
1958 2018-12-09 20:10:08 Marmite Chanukiyah??!! What's that, a Chanukiya made of Marmite jars? If so, do you use oil? I can't imagine putting candles in it!
1959 2018-12-09 20:10:04 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

1965 2018-12-09 20:09:17 I oppose
1966 2018-12-09 20:09:09 1.Preheat a nonstick sauté pan with a small amount of oil or butter over  2.Shake bottle and pour into the hot pan. 
3.Egg begins to cook and set, use a rubber spatula to gently pull  the mixture to the middle of the pan.
4.Continue cooking until no longer wet

1967 2018-12-09 20:09:04 Former tribal lands in Oklahoma produced what would probably amount to trillions of dollars today in oil revenues during the early 20th century and tribes saw very little of that money
1968 2018-12-09 20:08:49 the south: gets 3 inches of snow 

southerners: dear diary..it’s been 3 weeks since Father took the covered wagon to town for supplies..Mother has been mauled by a grizzly bear..the oil lamps are running low..Sister has scarlet fever...the end is nigh
1969 2018-12-09 20:08:41 I know a lot of us use #CBDOils or cream for various reasons, and I was just curious about best places to buy online. I've been using CBD oil for a couple of years, but I'm mostly trying to find the CBD pain cream for my mom who has chronic back pain (osteoarthritis). Best buys?
1970 2018-12-09 20:08:37 The argument was that BC wanted to refine & upgrade the oil, this is cost prohibitive considering the cost of CWS oil. Even at $50bbl it’s cost prohibitive & AB would still lose money refining it.
1971 2018-12-09 20:08:32 Yeah, he should wake up and put red oil on your head every morning too, that's how to properly worship some traditional deities/statues 
1972 2018-12-09 20:08:22 And as I rolled over to loosin the oil drain plug  I rolled on to a pile of sh!t .   #oilchangefail
1973 2018-12-09 20:08:16 Eat avocados, steak and bacon too; dress with olive oil and butter; fry in lard. You cannot survive for long if you only eat plants. At least that's my take on the matter.
1974 2018-12-09 20:08:00 Exactly this. Many will remain unemployed while waiting for oil to rebound. 

My personal field is oil adjacent in AB and I’m waiting..... while paying bills working retail. 

It’s good work for shitty pay but I enjoy it.
1975 2018-12-09 20:07:56 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
1976 2018-12-09 20:07:48 In ruins sitting on almost unimaginable oil wealth.
1977 2018-12-09 20:07:45 Right, so went to the fish n chip shop was like I’ll get the veggie sausage, asked if the batter was vegetarian too and they were like nah so I was like cool, that’s fine I’ll just have it plain to which they tell me it’s cooked in the same oil as the fish 
1978 2018-12-09 20:07:42 If you wanna say fuck it and just make yourself go into labor drink castor oil  I did that with my daughter she was too big lol
1979 2018-12-09 20:07:31 Na God dey save human beings my brother. We will still buy mama put. The groundnut oil they will use for the mama put, we have no idea
1980 2018-12-09 20:07:25 I'm all about those fish oil and metamucil lyrics!
1981 2018-12-09 20:07:15 Quebec doesn’t seem to think we are in this together (and let’s not forget BC governments take on Canadian oil)
1982 2018-12-09 20:07:14 With that amount of oil?
1983 2018-12-09 20:07:12 Do u put it on a few hours before you hop in the shower? I’ve used hair masks and Argan oil but mines been so frizzy since I bleached it
1984 2018-12-09 20:07:03 @DamionCrawford Holness is being led headlessly along same path Seaga took 1983 to 1989,Petrojam oil wealth,Israel facist spy network in thè Black Ppl Region,Seaga was retired with his head,permanently#p'cess
1985 2018-12-09 20:06:59 All he wants is Ukraine. He needs shipping oil access ...
1986 2018-12-09 20:06:51 @sweetfacedinero hi love do you have any other essential oil combination recommendations?! i loved the ones you posted earlier! 
1987 2018-12-09 20:06:51 I’m about to go to India and snag me one of those millionaire that be invested into oil and shit
1988 2018-12-09 20:06:49 I assume that includes the auto and oil industry?
1989 2018-12-09 20:06:37 ETR is calling Saudi Arabia could you come back reasonable part as Western Ally & end this unholy alliance w. hostile Russia fixing the oil price, end OPEC & join OECD, leave Jemen to UNO, OSCE Peace @usosce, Invite @IraqiGovt to @GCC & sign EU FTA with @GCC -become NATO Partner
1990 2018-12-09 20:06:29 People of Pakistan will see marvellous achievements,rapid progress in all the fields in 5 years tenure of Imran Khan,In Shaa Allah. Allah is showering His blessings on IK,huge oil and gas reservoirs have been found , bcoz of honest leader. One can see nahoosat on Ahsan Iqbal Face
1991 2018-12-09 20:06:27 Flipped burger. You are the worst leader in modern history, urging people to buy oil - because you say "maybe", contradicting people all over the world who actually know. They are called scientists, and they are not allowed to make unfounded statements. Unlike you.
1992 2018-12-09 20:06:26 Top down government planners can control the earth's climate and weather but can't supply a country with adequate supply of toilet paper. 
1993 2018-12-09 20:05:58 What a shame considering all the oil they have!
1994 2018-12-09 20:05:52 Im just sitting here with 3 bottles of massage oil for my next gf where she at tho.....
1995 2018-12-09 20:05:36 What's the acronym @GOP stand for these days, anyway? Good Ol' Putin? Get Out, Puertos? Geriatric Oil Patrons? Gremlins Outrank People? There are just SO many perfectly accurate possibilities! What a time to be alive!
1996 2018-12-09 20:05:27 HIMARS from the omar oil field also support and rain fire :))
1997 2018-12-09 20:05:21 Oil engineers are like fathers watching the growth of their children from a distance. "Our American oil engineers can make sediments into the reservoir and build oil from them. In simple language, bring your kids back.But much less time
1998 2018-12-09 20:04:56 The scale of HW Bush veneration sucked, but your “war criminal” evidence is extremely weak

Iraq literally started an imperialist war to annex its neighbor’s oil reserves, how was the invasion of Kuwait a lie?

Bombing retreating military formations is also not a war crime
1999 2018-12-09 20:04:55 Eric Friedman's so called coalition to expand the new emissions bill kind of leaves Darren rock in stumped upon the poarch of oil and Getty's Amber Getty's gas proposal from 1979 cause he can't play the reform he never had privilege to hear he can only recant his dads talking

2001 2018-12-09 20:04:43 I’m going easy on you this week. You have access to oil and naked flames right now. I’m taking no chances.
2002 2018-12-09 20:04:35 These poor and uneducated people scooping oil from the gutter will not feed their own children from the gutter.....it is not poverty, it is just pure and applied wickedness...
2003 2018-12-09 20:04:18 Yes Owned persons from Goldman Sachs and oil and pharma and television.
So that means both are puppets 
2004 2018-12-09 20:04:15 Sublingual drops or spray. SelectCBD oil is my go-to brand. I prefer the lavender flavor.
2005 2018-12-09 20:04:07 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products, Chris. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks, Emma
2006 2018-12-09 20:04:01 Three of the top oil producing nations right now.
2007 2018-12-09 20:03:56 i don't see Saudi Arabia having the same problems as Venezuela, and what is it specifically that makes a country too oil dependent. why can't they develop other areas in the market. obviously if they have a large oil market, that would help other industries succeed.
2008 2018-12-09 20:03:39 Why?  To pay back their BIG donors who don’t want to install purifiers before dumping waste into waterways.  Shippers who don’t want cover load to protect spillage.  Oil companies & pipeline owners who don’t want to pay for cleanup.
2009 2018-12-09 20:03:39 Now, they're an oil refinery fire. Let's hope the Eagles receive the same fate
2010 2018-12-09 20:03:18 I saw @Mypule_'s tweet about how the @PurpulHair oil helped grow her daughter's hair. I want to try it on my daughter because we're really struggling with her hair. @Asiphe_Mgudlwa I really think this oil would be great for your afro babe. @Ndanaka1

2013 2018-12-09 20:02:06 Not just Saudi Arabia.  Russia weeps as well as their economy is very dependent on high gas and oil prices
2014 2018-12-09 20:01:36 After this oil change and these groceries don’t ask me to go anywhere because I will say yes lmao and I don’t need to spend anything else 
2015 2018-12-09 20:01:36 Trump and the Saudi King are letting the world know they control the Petro-Dollar now, and will tank the price of oil as much as it is necessary. The strings have been cut, and we have entered Petro-Dollar warfare with the death of Khashoggi. 20) Message to the NWO: Checkmate!!
2016 2018-12-09 20:01:24 Somebody cannot even buy puff puff again for fear of eating the one that was fried with groundnut oil scooped from gutter 
2017 2018-12-09 20:01:17 Flavor of the year for “progressives”: attack oil companies but absolve the source of demand, the drivers.
2018 2018-12-09 20:01:14 Start your day with an organic #face #oil for your skin and massage for a few minutes with upward strokes.  Breathe in the smells and enjoy the benefits of organic #products. Say no to chemicals especially on your face.  They only harm your skin and you never see results.
2019 2018-12-09 20:01:13 I can't take you seriously as a film critic if you don't get animation.

That's like a food critic who largely ignores French cuisine and gives a negative review to anything buttery because they prefer olive oil. 

And fuck yeah animation is the French cuisine of film, fight me.
2020 2018-12-09 20:01:11 Try to get your hands on some neem oil and make a repellant (google) or buy it already made, check Hipro at White Marl.

2026 2018-12-09 20:00:46 and we all know crude oil is the major source of revenue in the nation, the fall in price of crude oil was one of the reason why Nigeria economy fell into recession.. will you call it buhari fault or OPEC ?

2032 2018-12-09 20:00:07 Husband and and I found a Raider Power Armor "Blood Cleanser" mod. The mental image of how that would work is terrifying. We have have come to the consensus it probably involves a fish tank water pump and a car oil filter in some way. #Fallout76
2033 2018-12-09 20:00:07 Because the republiCONs are owned by the oil and gas companies, they empty their tills to the republiCONs in lieu of total disregard for our air we breath and only provide you with more gas to pollute our air and destroy our country.
2034 2018-12-09 20:00:05 Bruh it don’t take this long to change no damn oil
2035 2018-12-09 20:00:03 Venezuela did not employ unfettered socialism and it failed mostly due to overdependance on their oil industry. It has as much to do with capitalism as socialism. Also, I'm more left wing than saul

2043 2018-12-09 19:59:21 I think you’re mistaken. Stock market, unemployment rate, price of oil, corporations coming back to the US... everything has been improving since Trump even became the President Elect because companies knew his policies were pro business and in favor of growth.

2047 2018-12-09 19:58:31 During Obama Presidency the oil price was almost $140
2048 2018-12-09 19:58:24 That's my worry. It must be made illegal for State Governors to spend funds from oil blocks on anything other infrastructural amenities.

2054 2018-12-09 19:58:00 Naive. Said it numerous times. We went into Iraq due to Neocons. Nothing to do with 911. Was it for oil? I dunno but it seemed to be to transform the middle east to some crazy idea of democracy. If the US stops going to war, do you think that will end war in the world?
2055 2018-12-09 19:57:58 Hi I am so thankful for CBD oil. That is all. Have a good day!
2056 2018-12-09 19:57:58 Guess they forgot to use that oil based lube....lmao
2057 2018-12-09 19:57:52 Jiffy Lube always trying to finesse me into paying for some extra shit. Just give me the mf oil change and let me be on my way lol
2058 2018-12-09 19:57:47 And we don't want to know about the plastic sheeting and baby oil
2059 2018-12-09 19:57:42 If oil mixes with gutter water I believe the oily colour will change and no one in there right senses will buy or even use that to cook I believe we are not animals and nobody wants to die.
2060 2018-12-09 19:57:23 Than lead by example Perron stop using all oil products

2063 2018-12-09 19:57:13 And what’s with the crunchy oil slick above the one ear?  
2064 2018-12-09 19:57:12 And 14% of it is Chinese coal. These second highest is the Saudi oil monopoly that produces 2%. The biggest villain here could not be more clear.

2066 2018-12-09 19:57:02 You need to be minding my hair oil. Idk what you waiting on
2067 2018-12-09 19:56:49 If we want to combat climate change we need to move away from oil & develop green sources of energy, produce bio-degradable everyday items, & plant a hell of a lot more trees. Trudeau’s plan may be subpar, but at least it’s a plan. Conservatives don’t have one for all of Canada.
2068 2018-12-09 19:56:42 We all knw things hv not been going well in the country  but the present gov't are not to be blamed rather the past gov't that has ruled for 16 years and have performed woefully,as of 2012 crude oil was sold 100 - 120 dollar per barrel today it's just around 60 dollar per barrel.
2069 2018-12-09 19:56:41 My mom and all my aunts talk about how they destroyed their skin by covering themselves in baby oil and laying in the sun all the time 30+ years ago to tan, now people fake tan instead so they don’t get skin cancer.
2070 2018-12-09 19:56:34 So instead, we buy our oil from countries with poor human rights and no environment rules on extracting the oil. Yeah, that makes perfect sense, Duh!
2071 2018-12-09 19:56:33 What we need is a friendly Arab power to depress oil prices.
2072 2018-12-09 19:56:26 I am not exactly sure what the context is, but Québec is reducing its dependency on oil and investing in alternatives, and public opinion supports this.  So I am not sure what is so wrong with what he said.  I am wondering what is Alberta buying from Québec to boycott?
2073 2018-12-09 19:56:17 Right, like half of the list is state oil companies selling oil to their own citizens who then burn the oil.
2074 2018-12-09 19:56:14 How about alternative sources of power? Wind, hydro, solar... And, it's clean! But no. You get money from the oil companies and countries, so screw us, screw the country, screw our planet...
2075 2018-12-09 19:56:11 Hey loser if you don’t know how to check your oil you shouldn’t be driving a car
2076 2018-12-09 19:56:09 Your mate are training children. U are treating beard. Your mate are buying Baby oil u are buying beard oil.
2077 2018-12-09 19:55:47 Oh chicken little....the sky is falling.   Face it.  The world runs on oil
2078 2018-12-09 19:55:44 Heard the oil companies were going to quit delivering gas to Washington state, save the environment.
2079 2018-12-09 19:55:07 Bucket list!
2080 2018-12-09 19:55:04 What is he even saying? That this snake oil salesman became a president is astounding.
2081 2018-12-09 19:54:57 For the jobless or people with unused degrees, hazardous waste cleanup like oil products, asbestos and similar things are not bad fields to be in with a green new deal coming. Join an environmental company. I'm happy and helping. You could be too. Most companies train you for it.
2082 2018-12-09 19:54:46 Coalition: Houthis deliberately delaying entry of three ships to Yemen
Arab Coalition announced that 17 permits were issued for ships heading to Yemen carrying food and oil products.
They also confirmed that the Houthi militias have deliberately delayed the entry of three ships
2083 2018-12-09 19:54:45 Winston wrapped up in coconut oil or something?
2084 2018-12-09 19:54:42 You got so unspun you remind me of little black sambo chasing the tiger. You talk as if you think you know something about Alberta, how? bad royalty structure? Gov't are bad business people. Abandoned wells? wherever there is oil, climate emergency? in whose mind? Red Herrings.
2085 2018-12-09 19:54:38 Oil is bad because we risk complete dependence on the revenue, or we’d be destitute, scavenging in the heather without it.
2086 2018-12-09 19:54:36 What? Are you saying the Canucks will not accept Oil Can Junior with praise and open arms? an innocent victim of fake news??
2087 2018-12-09 19:54:32 Did I just see oil industry propaganda implying one method would preserve ‘the green’ over the other (tankers vs piping) 

There’s a fusion reactor in the sky. Solar has never been more viable, especially in combination with thermal or wind.

2091 2018-12-09 19:54:08 Startup methods to come up with a startup idea, they’re wrong. But that’s just a strawman of Eric’s intentions.

Also, the thread just got plain weird when it got into talking about aggression and some Olive Oil company that looks like it’s run out of a basement. Not the best
2092 2018-12-09 19:54:04 Is it weird I enjoy doing things like getting an oil change lol
2093 2018-12-09 19:54:00 How do they make vegetable oil?
2094 2018-12-09 19:53:43 I hope your cardboard and motor oil pancakes are delicious. 
2095 2018-12-09 19:53:21 Typical denier: starts babbling about a different topic because they are losing the one on the importance of climate change. The issue is coal and oil. No point you fabricating others.
2096 2018-12-09 19:53:19 got an oil diffuser for work and my stress level has decreased by half 
2097 2018-12-09 19:53:15 Don't get it twisted, I wake up every day next to a headscarf and coconut oil. My wife is a black queen. #ThisIsUs

2101 2018-12-09 19:52:10 Buhari said subsidy was a scam. 

He just agreed a deal to pay nearly 1bn dollars for a scam to oil importers despite selling fuel for 145. Crude at 55usd.

They couldn't fathom why GEJ paid subsidy wit crude at 100usd and fuel selling at 97. 
@OfficialPDPNig @APCNigeria
2102 2018-12-09 19:51:56 Would he also “deport” all the “immigrant” workers from other provinces that work in his precious oil fields?
2103 2018-12-09 19:51:37 Have any of my friends tried CBD Oil for anxiety ?
2104 2018-12-09 19:51:32 but like also we fried ourselves in baby oil for 3 months straight soooo
2105 2018-12-09 19:51:27 Avengers: I can’t believe I am the granddaughter of a man who founded and was a name partner in a prestigious hotshit CPA firm who did accounting for huge multinational corporations like Shell Oil. Seriously that gene didn’t just skip me it ghosted me.

2107 2018-12-09 19:50:48 We've never has a recession before the 10/2 yr yield curve inverts. Every time in the past, the recession has come 9-18 mths after the 10/2 yr curve inverts. Rates are low, credit is available, materials like oil & copper are not expensive, companies are making $$$. So, not yet.
2108 2018-12-09 19:50:38 Must be the shipping out cause a lot in Quebec dont give a rats ass about shipping oil in
2109 2018-12-09 19:50:34 2/ The marketing job for EE was that it would reduce dependence on foreign oil. The job is already mostly done except for NB and NL. Irving said it wouldn't feel obliged to refine bitumen. It would have to spent billions on a coking unit and why would it bother?
2110 2018-12-09 19:50:04 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2111 2018-12-09 19:50:02 Is this a joke? Mine was in the garage about 10 times, faulty electrics (windows wouldn’t stay closed, auto wipers didn’t work), fault stop/start battery, timing chain replaced twice, engine replaced after 28k miles died to excessive oil consumption! Absolute RIOT! AVOID!!
2112 2018-12-09 19:50:01 A mixture of garlic, honey and olive oil, dad's recipe for throat infection since I was little it's awful but very effective.
2113 2018-12-09 19:49:53 That may be. I feel like churches have been manipulated by oil companies over the years and that this is part of the jingoistic madness we face now. It makes me sad for us and them
2114 2018-12-09 19:49:44 I saw a video on instablog where some people were scooping vegetable oil from the gutter.  All the puff puff and akara I’ve bought , I can’t help but think about it 
2115 2018-12-09 19:49:43 Funny I've been out of work since 2017 college educated not in the oil industry but I can't find work. Have lost 3 jobs since the NDP came to power. Many just like me out there. No more savings I'll be retiring on cat food. @suepeac am I playing the victim. You should move east
2116 2018-12-09 19:49:39 Robust economy managed by intellectuals that couldn't absorb change in crude oil price thus resorting to borrowing to pay salary after it slip to $75,An economy that was on free fall just bcoz oil price slip downward,intellectual that spend 16yrs diversifying our economy on paper
2117 2018-12-09 19:49:22 That is the normal iranian oil price right now in the black market.
2118 2018-12-09 19:49:16 "The biggest decline in absolute emissions came in the United States, where greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 0.5 percent in spite of efforts by the Trump administration to bring back coal, develop offshore oil, and withdraw from the Paris climate accord." Thanks @BarackObama!
2119 2018-12-09 19:49:13 Oil companies pay about half of what other companies pay in taxes, so even if they're outraged, they're not being taxed enough.
2120 2018-12-09 19:49:09 So it’s one of those days. 

Took my car to get an oil change and found out it needs major work done and they will need the car all day. Called mom to get a ride home (she can drive short distances). Problem is that I have her keys...
2121 2018-12-09 19:49:08 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
2122 2018-12-09 19:48:58 facts. I've lived and died on junkyards for that stuff but the turbo VW and turbo Mitsubishi stuff is all picked through immediately. I've had to use a drill press to make my own banjo bolts for the oil and water lines on the turbo more than once lol.
2123 2018-12-09 19:48:54 The planet is being run by these greedy oil companies, we are all doomed when the likes of Trump is in power. There  are alternative green technologies but guess what they get bought by the oil companies and never get used.

2125 2018-12-09 19:48:51 Another thought. The Line 9 reversal has allowed Ontario refineries to receive American feedstock (Western oil via the US). They receive almost no non-US foreign oil now. Refineries in QC have reduced their foreign receipts. Line 3 has the potential to put an end to those. /2
2126 2018-12-09 19:48:38 Nobody can stop Scotland using the pound, it's part Scottish. And we'll still be happy to sell you our oil, water, electricity and foodstuffs. Good neighbour's and all that, eh?
2127 2018-12-09 19:48:20 People brought that multilevel marketing essential oil stuff into my workplace. I tried to warn people about the companies, but they just got angry that I dared to say anything.

2130 2018-12-09 19:48:03 I ate some flaxseed today and couldn't get it out of my head how much it tasted like linseed oil. I looked it up there the same thing. Learn something new everyday.
2131 2018-12-09 19:47:41 Earlier this year, longtime oil investor T. Boone Pickens closed his energy-focused fund, BP Capital, and Jamison Capital Partners LP shut down its $1.5 billion flagship fund. Last August, legendary oil trader Andrew Hall closed his main fund at Astenbeck Capital Management LLC.
2132 2018-12-09 19:47:32 RT @WaterWired: "In the age of artificial intelligence data is the new oil and China is the new Saudi Arabia." - @kaifulee on @FareedZakaria GPS @CNN >> and here cometh the intellectual cartel.
2133 2018-12-09 19:47:16 Nice jug of engine oil lol
2134 2018-12-09 19:47:04 Trading algorithms in the oil market generally buy and sell based on price patterns, ignoring fundamental information. That could magnify one-way moves as such programs pile into market trends.
2135 2018-12-09 19:46:55 Obama has spent more time exploring for oil than he has spent looking for original birth certificate.

2137 2018-12-09 19:46:50 A skeleton does not scare me. But a 2 fold increase in cancer and a 4 fold increase in asthma in humans does. Have you ever been to a tank truck spill? Have you stood on an oil site and breathed in the vapours? If you have, you wouldn’t be talking nonsense.
2138 2018-12-09 19:46:50 The real Hannukah miracle is that the Jews got to use up their oil supply before the USA could destabilize their government and steal it

2140 2018-12-09 19:46:31 And if you’re from Atlantic Canada, you should be very concerned about that because if we can’t produce oil & sell at world prices, you guys can’t provide services or balance your budgets. You’re struggling now. What happens if there’s a sudden $1.5 billion hole in your budgets?
2141 2018-12-09 19:46:29 You are simply delusional if you believe the programs against coal and oil are in any way of the same magnitude as to the threat of climate change. And it is the poorest that are at the greatest risk.
2142 2018-12-09 19:46:29 No-you're right and not bad!! Capito ordered a study from Energy Dept which is a huge WET sloppy kiss to China/oil and gas industry-plastics too-they are literally going to KILL US! And 99% of them don't live here!! Look at cancer rates in CA and Louisiana/Mississippi-ALL BAD!
2143 2018-12-09 19:46:27 I saw @Mypule_'s tweet about how the @PurpulHair oil helped grow her daughter's hair. I want to try it on my daughter because we're really struggling with her hair. @Asiphe_Mgudlwa I really think this oil would be great for your afro babe. @Ndanaka1

2148 2018-12-09 19:46:01 How about we stop using our oil sands right after eastern Canada stops using imported OPEC oil.
2149 2018-12-09 19:46:01 Yo I didn’t dilute this tea tree oil and my face is on fucking fire!!! I deserve this bc I know this shit is strong so WHY THE FUCK WOULD I not dilute it
2150 2018-12-09 19:45:51 On Nov. 13, for example, the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index notched its biggest one-day gain since 2011, up 39%. That day, crude futures capped a record streak of 12 consecutive sessions of losses.

2154 2018-12-09 19:45:32 Now Playing Joshua Rogers - Pour Your Oil
2155 2018-12-09 19:45:28 We're hurting because there have been structural changes in the oil industry that have made dependence on the US market inconvenient. Pipeline approvals and construction don't happen overnight, even in the US where Line 3 and Keystone have had difficulties.
2156 2018-12-09 19:45:18 So the flaring and the 42 tanker trucks in 1.5 hours is ok with you? There are inherent risks to everything. However, pipelines have proven to be the safest mode of transport. Until we have a viable alternative, our reliance on oil will not decline.

2161 2018-12-09 19:45:01 Part time work isn’t growing an economy. Destroying our oil industry isn’t growing our economy.  Pushing Alberta to the point of separating isn’t growing our economy. Handing over our sovereignty to the UN isn’t growing our economy
2162 2018-12-09 19:44:50 The world does not listen. EU and UN have sold their souls to Arabs, to oil and money. Israel must trust in God and then you know that G-D will fulfill his promise of covenant with Israel.
2163 2018-12-09 19:44:49 Why? I'm simply saying that Lorenzo's Oil is a really bad example to use. It's actually a better example for me of when people claim something is a cure-all without actual evidence. They'd done the research on it and it doesn't do what people claim it does.
2164 2018-12-09 19:44:47 People don’t realize that oil is not just used for fuelling cars, but for the parts that go into those cars, as well as all of their electronic devices and many other items they use on the daily. Plus, cobalt and lithium mines for the batteries are just as damaging to the earth.
2165 2018-12-09 19:44:38 Try a beard shampoo (less harsh). And use a beard balm/oil after; keeps the hairs softer, skin moisturised and can be scented
2166 2018-12-09 19:44:27 It could be time to redirect those funds to continue building out border wall. The middle east countries are oil rich and don't deserve America's funding...

2168 2018-12-09 19:44:17 While geopolitical tensions and economic concerns have sent oil prices spiraling, analysts and traders say the shifting makeup of the market has exacerbated swings, with traditional players like supply-and-demand focused hedge funds, market makers and banks scaling back.
2169 2018-12-09 19:44:14 Sales tax has nothing to do with oil. Try again you tired clown!
2170 2018-12-09 19:44:13 Modern technology brought to you by Capitalism! By the way, question for all of you libturds, other than oil they drill for, what has the Arab nations and socialist countries contributed to society?

2174 2018-12-09 19:43:39 CBD oil is a miracle cure.
2175 2018-12-09 19:43:34 I don't extract w/ solvents like isopropyl alcohol or butane - have used 190 proof ethanol and chocolate, but it's not really necessary. Just use coconut oil and low temp: 160F in a small crockpot.  Extracting at a higher temperature decarboxylates THCA; I only want CBD.
2176 2018-12-09 19:43:32 Computerized trading is playing an ever-greater role in the oil market, helping to amplify the volatility that has accompanied crude’s recent downward lurch.

High priced high steel and aluminum. GDP is 3.5 was 4.2. We are making less objects, so pricing goes up. Wages are flat
2205 2018-12-09 19:40:51 I would rather be apart of the EU @Jacob_Rees_Mogg than save a fiver on a pair of shoes, which in any case the savings would never be past on just like the oil companies don’t! #C4Brexit
2206 2018-12-09 19:40:47 Of course there’s been spills idiot,nobody ever argued there  hasn’t been spills,you ever heard anybody in the oil business deny there hasn’t been spills?
2207 2018-12-09 19:40:46 The problem with too many neocons in gov't. Time for the U.S. to cut the Saudi's loose. There was a time when an argument could be made due to our oil dependence and security of the region; but we no longer need their oil, and they're a disruptive regime that supports terrorists.
2208 2018-12-09 19:40:43 I will ALWAYS support it. I give my stage 4 cancer-fighting daughter CBD oil everyday. You using ur platform to make a statement for all those who don’t have a voice are what heroes are. Got me as a big time fan now!!!
2209 2018-12-09 19:40:38 For that

round eyes. She will heal with oil. Those who hated
her ( for no reason )
2213 2018-12-09 19:40:25 If you research how much oil companies actually make from how much we spend on gas it’s clear that they are just as furious about all the taxes as we are... it decreases their profits abundantly. We pay roadside tax and our roads are still terrible... be mad at who’s taxing us
2214 2018-12-09 19:40:14 Man you must be sweating orange spray tan and Crisco oil right now.

2219 2018-12-09 19:39:57 Unreasonable objection. Only ONE more tanker a day would be in the harbour! There are already hundreds of ships docking daily, are they leaking oil?? One more would cause havoc? Not reasonable!
2220 2018-12-09 19:39:40 LMAO, for someone who pretends to care about climate change you sure seem to love defending these right wing protests against a gas tax that would reduce the dependence of fossil fuels, I bet big oil corporations love these protests as much as you do.
2221 2018-12-09 19:39:38 @GraigKreindler Here is a paint question: Having used acrylic for a few years,  but I started dabbling with oils, do you used straight oil? or water soluble oils or both?
2222 2018-12-09 19:39:38 
2223 2018-12-09 19:39:33 You need to understand that if all of this was happening because of uncontrollable factors (say a major global depression) then there wouldn’t be much to be angry about. It would be awful, but no one’s fault. The oil business is volatile and everyone here understands that.
2224 2018-12-09 19:39:26 Yhuuuu ndinga mgalela nge mbiza ye cooking oil e tshisayo elele.
2225 2018-12-09 19:39:15 What disgusting propaganda! This again is just about profits for the oil companies. Has nothing to do with "winning" for the American people! They send the crude overseas for refining (formerly banned by law!) & then will buy the refined product back at a higher cost!!! IDIOTS!!
2226 2018-12-09 19:39:14 Following the scooping of veg oil from the gutter by selfish Nigerians, it's safe to say we should be on the look out for pockets and patterns of epidemics; stuff like 3 students developing gastroenteritis in a class, workers in an office taking sick leave should raise suspicion
2227 2018-12-09 19:39:09 Great Clean Air Act! Too bad EPA in bed with Oil and not enforcing it, to extent it should have been!!
2228 2018-12-09 19:39:08 UN is dominated by Islamic countries and Arab oil and money. So you get a resolution for each other or not.
2229 2018-12-09 19:38:52 I must say, you are really pleasant. Oil stooges should be shamed? Yeah. You've never been to Texas. Good luck with all that brilliance. Way to plan staying in the minority FOREVER.
2230 2018-12-09 19:38:40 It’s amazing how quickly wounds healed when covered. Once healed applying Rose oil seems to help with scaring.
2231 2018-12-09 19:38:37 Hoping AAOG hits oil at R1/R2 and Mengo. Plan is to take some profit and throw it at EVRH ahead of the 19th. Hopefully it stays low for a week or so
2232 2018-12-09 19:38:31 Thank you! 
Don't know man. I guess I just have to be patient and push out more of this stuff. 

Well, I started oil painting based on a Bob Ross tutorial book and are turning it into my own style more and more. 

Thx for the support bro. 
2233 2018-12-09 19:38:31 What a load of pernicious nonesence. Oil spills? Yeah right. The FNs complaining aren't even on the pipeline route they want a cut of the royalties. $$$$ gullible people like you eat this nonsense up.
2234 2018-12-09 19:38:26 MARY was a virgin and she married a carpenter (JOSEPH). U aren't a virgin n u r waiting 4 a billionaire to marry u.. My sista u need a crate of anointing oil! 
2235 2018-12-09 19:38:19 My dad and stepmom asked me what I wanted for my birthday and Christmas. I responded with, “I would be ok with a new tires, and oil change, and an alignment for a combined birthday, Christmas, and graduation present. 

Is this adulthood?

2238 2018-12-09 19:37:45 We had oil and gas, higher taxes than we have now, higher royalties than we have now at much higher prices.

2241 2018-12-09 19:37:29 Other random Sunday thoughts - pimple cream works, it's amazing. Especially the kind with tea tree oil
2242 2018-12-09 19:37:24 W. WATTS. Blame Trudeau all you want but Conservatives ran Alberta for 4 decades and one decade federally before Trudeau...take a look at yourselves and how Albertan conservatives mismanaged your oil.  Your whining is tedious and tiresome.
2243 2018-12-09 19:37:13 No . The oil in the food will fuck your shit up lol
2244 2018-12-09 19:37:09 does involve dicing you, tossing you in olive oil, salt, pepper, & garlic powder, and putting you in a 350 degree oven for 35-40 minutes?
2245 2018-12-09 19:37:05 have the sawbones rub some squirrel oil on Lt. Hill’s lower extremity...it’s been known to work wonders.
2246 2018-12-09 19:37:02 December of every year, oil marketers will shutdown operations over dispute with the government. I can't remember any December this doesn't happen.
2247 2018-12-09 19:36:51 The sale of “unsustainably sourced palm oil” will be debated in parliament tomorrow!!

2250 2018-12-09 19:36:30 Here's an idea for Hasbro Star Wars, the next step up from Digi Face Printing: Realistic Smells.

2253 2018-12-09 19:36:06 I wanted to thank everyone for their input about the pet cbd oil. Shelby Walchanowicz and Lauri Fraley Winke I bought the 750 mg and started giving Tazzy two drops in the evening and he's good until the next evening. It has worked wonders! Thank you so much!

2255 2018-12-09 19:35:41 The point is you have no idea what your talking about in regards to oil spills and the cleanup procedures ,I actually do seeing as I’ve cleaned up many,every inch of contaminated soil is removed and replaced
2256 2018-12-09 19:35:38 Thrilled to be a speaker at #niic2018, presenting my work at @MNEEPRaceEquity and partnerships for Equity. Come to the first session (Together for Equity)! Great theme: from resistance to victory, burning that oil no matter the challenges.
2257 2018-12-09 19:35:15 Even then, things shake up the scientific world all the time.
2258 2018-12-09 19:35:03 With brown teeth like someone that drinks red oil...
2259 2018-12-09 19:35:00 Amazing Billy! I can’t wait to hear all about your research on palm oil 
2260 2018-12-09 19:34:53 The collapse in the price of oil, the lack of a diversified economy, the willingness of the government to print money, and defaults on its debt destroyed the Venezuelan economy. Socialism had very little to do with it.
2261 2018-12-09 19:34:52 That’ll be the £ facing a massive devaluation without Scotland’s oil to prop it up then?
2262 2018-12-09 19:34:48 got my oil now and my weed
2263 2018-12-09 19:34:45 Here’s an idea: why don’t you stop presenting scapegoating, bone-headed brand loyalty, and willful ignorance as a “an idea” instead of the cult of death resignation that it is? We have 10 years for our planet. Oil stooges should be shamed.
2264 2018-12-09 19:34:43 Some people have cured their cancer by consuming only juiced vegetables and alkalizing their body. I've also heard good things about cannabis oil. Also baking soda.
2265 2018-12-09 19:34:30 Oil marketers are saboteurs
God himself wish punish them if they instigate crisis this Dec
Didn't the govt say the marketers will have N236 billion in the kitty by Fri?
2266 2018-12-09 19:34:06 Alafu juzi a Nduthi guy told me ati renewable energy is a ploy by the US to undermine the Arab Oil Industry. Nlichoka tu msee...
2267 2018-12-09 19:34:01 It seems despite not having PST almost everything cost almost the same or sometimes more as PST provinces often even more then BC. I was given many reasons, it cost more to bring things here, oil field workers pays are higher, businesses are charging more.
2268 2018-12-09 19:33:55 It is stunning to me that it is taking media so long to link Putin's desire to access Exxon technology to reach Arctic oil with Trump and the plot to put him in the White House. Think TILLERSON... Why did Trump pick him after just one meeting to THAT position? He didn't know him.
2269 2018-12-09 19:33:55 YES. If one day's oil can last whatever whatever, you can do this.

It will be a HANUKKAH MIRACLE.

2270 2018-12-09 19:33:52 I bought Dennis lavender essential oil from France. He looks at it and says “do I drink this?” 
2271 2018-12-09 19:33:48 Sadly most of that blood was shed in misdirected retribution.  We should have immediately seized Saudi Arabia's assets and blocked any oil shipments, that would have put a stop to 99% of that crap.
2272 2018-12-09 19:33:33 @LidlUK why do your onion rings contain palm oil?
2273 2018-12-09 19:33:26 Isn't this pretty much the same tactic as Saddam used? You know, setting fire to his oil fields as he retreated across Kuwait? I'm sure history will be as kind to the Wisconsin GOP.
2274 2018-12-09 19:33:26 For Qatar, let's check this/these suggestions if it's for the betterment of Qatar's gov't as well as for everyone in the planet Earth. Bear in mind, the main product of the Middle East is oil, it's for everyone's/everybody's need.


2275 2018-12-09 19:33:25 You can pacify this beast with chemical weapons. Just spray a fine mist of oil made of Nepata Cataria around it, and it becomes docile...
2276 2018-12-09 19:33:21 I like the babassu oil & mint conditioner, the avocado hair milk, and the honey & ginger styling gel. I wanna tryntheir new lines though
2277 2018-12-09 19:33:16 xtra fry the groundnut oil before frying???
2278 2018-12-09 19:32:58 indeed!  decades... cleanups of oil/extraction /contaminated sites always an expensive problem for all parties related to a site (Environment CAD has a slew of files and so, legal costs.. ) … these wounds in the Earth literally.. cheers!
2279 2018-12-09 19:32:55 As I've pointed out in other threads on a similar vein, we have to recognize that the boom/bust cycle in oil artificially raises costs elsewhere. So O&G in a boom pushes up the cost of hiring in other sectors, increasing long term costs in govt.
2280 2018-12-09 19:32:50 I think the squirrel oil is helping Andrew Luck.

2284 2018-12-09 19:32:25 BEFORE SLEEPING KNOW THIS:

Before going to Bed (sleep), apply some Oil (Sesame, Brahmi) to your feet and then MASSAGE your feet. 
This induces SOUND SLEEP and also reduces Hypertension.
2285 2018-12-09 19:32:24 Isn’t this the real reason for the second and current war in the Middle East. Isn’t it all about securing contracts for big oil rather than the security of America.  Now that’s corruption, sending young people off to potentially die for oil and military contractors.
2286 2018-12-09 19:32:22 The point is that if your government did the right thing they would not need EI. They would have well paying jobs in the oil patch. Now Bill C69 will guarantee the reliance on EI. That's on your government. Cute story though.
2287 2018-12-09 19:32:22 Cars based on 100 year old technology that would have progressed years ago if not held back by oil industry. 'Civilization' would be using zero carbon energy now if not repressed since 1950s. Environment on its knees, climate breaking down

2288 2018-12-09 19:32:21 How the biggest net oil exporter should act on potential ban on combustion engine ?
2289 2018-12-09 19:32:13 How the oil city nah ?
2290 2018-12-09 19:32:12 My whole point is that our society is dependent on oil. Currently, it's impossible to avoid. I'd prefer it if there were other options. It's not going to be 100%, but we can improve and use less.

But whenever anyone suggests this, y'all freak out.
2291 2018-12-09 19:32:08 Motor oil for hair growth? What's wrong with people please 
2292 2018-12-09 19:31:57 Well, Scotland is not relying on oil but they have it, which is a very valuable natural resource, not just as fuel, you may want to check up what else it is needed for, if something becomes scarce, the price soars. Norway invested it in a fund
2293 2018-12-09 19:31:57 10k is even too much for an Akara business, also remember the loan aint for starters, but lets assume a starter:1 paint of beans is 1850, 5litre of groundnut oil is 2000, onion, pepper, coal or gas, even with 5k in Lagos you can start an akara bizz, wetin this one dey talk??
2294 2018-12-09 19:31:47 Agree.  And the oil. All of it.  
2295 2018-12-09 19:31:39 I mean, you're not wholly wrong, but the shifting of action on climate from the major sources of pollution, like oil companies themselves, to the individual accomplishes nothing
2296 2018-12-09 19:31:38 Norway is a sovereign NATION. Alberta is not. Trillions of Alberta's oil revenue has been drained by equalization to feed the voracious maw of Quebec and its unions.
2297 2018-12-09 19:31:34 When you use oil, the mechanical inefficiency is converted to heat, so the heating is free.

2307 2018-12-09 19:30:11 How many oil spills have you cleaned up?
2308 2018-12-09 19:30:08 The GFS and the RDPS have been like water and oil over the past 5 or so days.  I guess nobody likes these retrograding warm fronts / troughs /  lows.

2314 2018-12-09 19:29:42 I drive a gas guzzling SUV, have no intentions of riding a bike. Quit using oil entirely if you hate it. Maybe research all the products you use on a daily basis that are oil based and quit using them. Maybe you can get your food brought into the city on bicycles
2315 2018-12-09 19:29:36 At best that is a fairy tale told to children and the simple minded.  The "Alberta Advantage" was based n freak and unsustainable high oil prices.
2316 2018-12-09 19:29:35 That's a tricky question  The name Natural Products is a chimera! For experts it means something but for general audience it could means lot of difference things: corn, coconut, oil, gas etc. can be defined as natural products.
2317 2018-12-09 19:29:30 I don’t care about how much money a man makes, id rather have him broke then him leaving me for weeks to go to an oil rig
2318 2018-12-09 19:29:26 The United States has the biggest stockpile of oil on the entire planet. We don't need Saudi oil.
2319 2018-12-09 19:29:23 Oil everywhere 
2320 2018-12-09 19:29:09 Lie again!? We be goin solid, with oil and kisses. Then y’all fall asleep or con us out of the same time 
2321 2018-12-09 19:29:08 Big oil companies won’t allow for something like this to happen. They buy every threat and dissolve them. Big companies that I’m sure Obama supported during his presidency.
2322 2018-12-09 19:29:06 I really think oil won’t feature into the future (because it’ll run out). If Dubai fear that, I think Scotland must also. Free subscriptions and uni education post-independence?
2323 2018-12-09 19:29:03 High gossypol is not good for male fertility. Are you suggesting this is a way for Pakistan and Gottingen University Researchers in this 2013 study to improve food security by reducing population? Are you in denial that GE cotton seed oil is problematic for GE industry?
2324 2018-12-09 19:28:59 It's Sunday night so those Pakistanis especially journalists that may be enjoying a little 'oil and honey' tonight, should avoid driving.

If you do have a collision or accident while drink driving, and strangers come to help, don't go tweeting the PM sent his hitmen to get you!
2325 2018-12-09 19:28:55 Putting coconut oil in your hair is all fun and self-care until you have to wash your hair like 3 times
2326 2018-12-09 19:28:54 When Dems take house you can vote fir their bill! If we lose the Saudis we lose a lot in Middle East. Much more likely to have to go to war with hostile actor nations. Look before you leap. All nations deal with criminals. Lay of land. I Don’t like it either. Consider oil also!
2327 2018-12-09 19:28:49 The general point is that we are not doing a good job of cleaning up oil spills. That can be from rigs or pipelines.
2328 2018-12-09 19:28:48 What’d you use? Flaxseed oil?
2329 2018-12-09 19:28:37 And based on current Mexican refinery configurations fuel oil exports will rise commensurately?
2330 2018-12-09 19:28:27 Mr Squidge ‘thats your present sorted this year, oil’.  ‘Oh, and you can buy me a security camera’
2331 2018-12-09 19:28:26 If so, then you should never have that comparison put up because you know obviously the infrastructural development on going, social intervention scheme, debt serving and all while the previous govt did nothing we can fall on Incase crude oil fails.
2332 2018-12-09 19:28:25 does tea tree oil help keloids??

2335 2018-12-09 19:27:57 Remember when the only thing I tweeted about was shower oil
2336 2018-12-09 19:27:49 Canada postal service is working today... just got my oil, thought I’d ordered capsules lol. So how to I take it? Give no intructions. I’ll look on line
2337 2018-12-09 19:27:46 Just made Palm oil rice with goat meat, fish and Uziza. Lool
2338 2018-12-09 19:27:40 someone is trying to sell me cbd oil through my own website
2339 2018-12-09 19:27:33 Yes. Glad I only buy sealed branded oil
2340 2018-12-09 19:27:28 Slept 4 hours ...now back to work. Realizing not having my oil pen really does effect my anxiety and insomnia. #MentalHealthAwareness #MedicalCannabis
2341 2018-12-09 19:27:20 Bro that bitch done got a tick bath, almond oil rub down the lot 
2342 2018-12-09 19:27:15 Poverty no go die ooo...u knw wether ur ancestors do use the head of person wey go get abundance do human sacrifice because him head get oil well well
2343 2018-12-09 19:27:05 Except there are documented cases of sensors not going off and pipelines spilling oil for days before anyone noticed.
2344 2018-12-09 19:27:05 Important to bear in mind that Norway (just the SM) isn't enough for the UK. We need the CU as well both coz of NI and the nature of our economy, i.e. manufactures are still significant (Norway is heavy on oil, forestry & fish, which the CU doesn't really affect).
2345 2018-12-09 19:26:59 Quoting Big Oil directly and against the carbon tax, yet also maligning Trudeau’s inaction on climate change dubbing it a business-friendly proposal. It seems like you try to have it both ways while essentially acting as a spokesman for the fossil fuel industry. Not a good look
2346 2018-12-09 19:26:54 I thought it would be a good idea to put some peppermint oil on my Christmas tree so y’know it smells Christmas...

But I’ve gone a bit overboard and sitting in the lounge is essentially like rubbing extra strong Trebor mints into your eyes 
2347 2018-12-09 19:26:51 Oil needs to go east to new markets.
2348 2018-12-09 19:26:36 That’s why I always check after an oil change.
2349 2018-12-09 19:26:33 US shale investors are kinda stupid. 

US shakes is producing a light oil which refineries are maxed out at, at double digit growth rates, financed by debt. US shale investors are, in essence, subsidizing energy users globally.
2350 2018-12-09 19:26:23 Big Oil is but a battle, an important battle, no doubt, but only a battle nonetheless.

BigAg is the War. Nothing has negatively affected our biosphere like BigAg. Nothing at all.
2351 2018-12-09 19:26:16 Made some soap with ginger wheat beer from local brewery. Added ginger oil and the entire basement smells like a ginger spa.
2352 2018-12-09 19:26:16 So as I’m at my moms place watching church live & she starts to put that holy oil all on my face lol. I busted out crying. Man my feelings & emotions were just really heavy I had to let it out. When she started holding me I felt the love & I NEEDED that
2353 2018-12-09 19:26:03 I don't have a car, so my fuel usage is relatively low. Much of my commuting is by bicycle.

I would love to see Canada move towards energy not based on oil, but people keep insisting on building pipelines. Alberta refuses to diversify its economy.
2354 2018-12-09 19:26:03 Talks about China’s interest in Africa. Silent on the US overthrow in Libya and France’s Total Oil co and other western companies contracts there. We wrote the playbook, China is just following it.
2355 2018-12-09 19:26:01 Oil my scalp so Ik it’s real.
2356 2018-12-09 19:26:00 I should’ve got my layaway off yesterday listening to Fat I gotta go today on top of grocery shopping and a oil change
2357 2018-12-09 19:25:52 I don't know if you ever tried it but gaultheria oil is pretty cool for muscular/articular pain
2358 2018-12-09 19:25:49 Of course we know what happens when profits get threatened. Big Oil will avoid the burden of costs and pass on any loss profits in the form of increases at pump, cuts in workforce, etc. Still this is how it should be, those earning the money pay the taxes
2359 2018-12-09 19:25:41 How so good sir? If you advocate a shut down of the oil industry the shutdown of a facility that was used for hydrocarbon engines in favour of a new plant for electric powered vehicles should be an achievement isn’t it?
2360 2018-12-09 19:25:38 I'm not arguing that we need to legalize it. I'm arguing that we shouldn't make claims that we can't substantiate officially yet. Doing so could be just as damaging as saying nothing at all. Yes, do more research and yes, more advocacy. But less "snake oil cure all".
2361 2018-12-09 19:25:21 Bouta change my oil, hope my car crushes me :)
2362 2018-12-09 19:25:05 Hacienda, San Antonio, Texas

2363 2018-12-09 19:24:56 Roasting chestnuts over an open fire. Recipe: Place chestnuts in a single layer in a pan. No need to add oil or grease; as they cook, the chestnuts will release their own oil. Cover the pan with a lid and hold it over the fire. Shake or stir making sure to roast all sides.
2364 2018-12-09 19:24:45 trim the back, then oil treatment, then wash
2365 2018-12-09 19:24:36 He’ll grab the high mileage Oil & Lube.
2366 2018-12-09 19:24:33 Well it’s been going for 30 years and no issues sooooo
2367 2018-12-09 19:24:20 I wonder where those Mexican oil go
2368 2018-12-09 19:24:16 And that has to do with pipelines how? Again,you hate oil,use your wallet and quit using it
2369 2018-12-09 19:24:13 Tesla Gigafactory 2 makes solar panels. Gigafactory 1 makes batteries for cars & energy storage systems. 
As soon as EVs supplant daily demand by 2 million barrels, the oil price will collapse and difficult oil will not be worth extracting. This will happen within the next 2 yrs.
2370 2018-12-09 19:24:10 SHIT ITS HE i miss chef leave me peri EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i asked for it wasnt a sip nyehehehe.
2371 2018-12-09 19:24:08 It amazes me how shortsighted the left is. They want to abolish fossil fuels but don't realize that most of their electronics would cease to work. If it weren't for fossil fuels we would still be using whale oil and traveling by horse and buggy.
2372 2018-12-09 19:24:04 Oil and gas got privatised for very very cheap. 

Either former party or KGB. 

Since then Putin's run the show like a feudal king, giving properties to loyal "lords" and confiscating lands and properties from disloyal ones.

2375 2018-12-09 19:23:54 Have you looked into CBD oil? Might be worth a try
2376 2018-12-09 19:23:42 Cotton not trad food even if Genetically Engineering a reduction in gossypol in cotton oil How do you know it is safe? FDA toxicology trials please.Not a traditional edible oil.2013 data you posted suggests GE Bt cotton crop increses calories but references industry only studies.
2377 2018-12-09 19:23:33 Lol okay
2378 2018-12-09 19:23:30 did my sister really tell me she's been boiling rice without adding salt and oil to the water and here are my parents tell me I'm over exaggerating when I say we were raised differently 
2379 2018-12-09 19:23:30 Awwwww poor Alberta and all their oil money have had it soooo tough over the years 
2380 2018-12-09 19:23:23 Oil prices and layoffs by oil companies are a concern, but the fact of the matter is the province has had strong economic growth in 2017 & and 2018. Those lost O&G jobs are gone and aren’t coming back.
2381 2018-12-09 19:23:17 Pick up tomorrow with boot floor mods (preventative), diff seal, all new rear bushes and full oil service (right oils vital in these). Bit later I'll do the big ends and mains then head gasket. None of these are big money to have done but it is if they fail first.
2382 2018-12-09 19:23:06 Except the heavy polluters are exempt in a last ditch effort to stem the exodus of investment in Alberta’s pristine oil & gas industry. Too bad it’s too late. They’re already gone. Furthermore, no individuals I know, including myself, can consume less energy than we already are.
2383 2018-12-09 19:23:05 Ontario said they would clean it up -the next move  was in court, trying to pass the buck ...  this is a great example of what will happen to the oil sands -  the clean up bill is  beyond the assets  of the oil companies -  Feds are playing dumb
2384 2018-12-09 19:22:59 When the contents of your purse spill all over the gym floor, including your birth control and oil pen, and multiple people give you strange looks
2385 2018-12-09 19:22:40 We have that much oil to export, yet we are paying exorbitant prices for gas since Trump became President?
2386 2018-12-09 19:22:33 Negotiate a trade deal, you are on drugs. Ask the auto, forestry, oil and gas, steel, aluminium workers how that trade deal went? Delusional is the best word to describe both of you. Add treasonous to Trudeau.
2387 2018-12-09 19:22:30 How come no one's concerned about the tankers who enter the east coast of Canada coming with oil from Saudi Arabia and other places in the world? Why only Canadian Oil being exported is an issue?
2388 2018-12-09 19:22:28 #Biblereader
Joel 2:19 Yea, The LORD will answer and say unto His people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:
2389 2018-12-09 19:22:24 im looking for this certain coconut oil for my hair
2390 2018-12-09 19:22:09 Number of dollars my business makes in the Oil & Gas sector = 0

Number of Ph.D’s working in my business  - 12

You seem be to making assumptions about me, or projecting that I am saying something I am not.
2391 2018-12-09 19:22:01 ...and Rose oil.
2392 2018-12-09 19:21:56 50 dollars for a oil cartridge that last 2 weeks or 20 dollars a day for bud 
2393 2018-12-09 19:21:49 Larry you’re fundamentally wrong, oil sands is not economical no matter what the condition, except $150/bbl. imo
2394 2018-12-09 19:21:38 No. Just roast it with some oil and then add it to stuff. Mousakka is both gross and a lie.
2395 2018-12-09 19:21:35 I used to want shit like shoes and toys and games and shit for Christmas but now I want real shit like rent paid and bills taken care of. Last mf asked me what I wanted for Christmas; i told em, "4 new tires and a oil change, you got me "
2396 2018-12-09 19:21:17 There’s a simple solution for you if you hate oil,quit using it
2397 2018-12-09 19:21:16 Not to mention that the world is moving quickly towards better, cleaner energy technologies. Alberta’s oil doesn’t have a long future.
2398 2018-12-09 19:21:09 The double Os. Oil and Opium.
2399 2018-12-09 19:20:59 Always using grapeseed or avocado oil with a stainless steel pan. Gonna look to find a ceramic one now. Thanks guys!
2400 2018-12-09 19:20:54 Let’s see, prior to Trump’s slithering into the presidency he was a reality TV ‘whatever’ and Tillerson ran ExxonMobil, one the world’s largest oil companies.

2405 2018-12-09 19:20:32 That’s not winning when the planet can’t support this kind of carbon impact. That’s the gop working for oil corporations. #GOPTaxScam America winning is health and prosperity and safety and peace for everyone

2407 2018-12-09 19:20:30 CAF Would do better to figure out how to take payment in oil. Plenty of cos could be the middleman to transact the barrels for them.
2408 2018-12-09 19:20:27 Nne...  It's basically a way for the govt to do Xmas for oil marketers every year. It sounds outrageous but this Nigeria. The arbitrage of the scarcity creates free money for marketers on the black market. The govt looks the other way. Perfect business transaction. Sad
2409 2018-12-09 19:20:19 Whisky is a massive export factor, seriously, I think whisky is one of the biggest exports, quite a bit of oil and in a world where natural resources become scarcer and scarcer it does increase in value dramatically. The only country in the UK with a trade surplus
2410 2018-12-09 19:20:18 A point in time U re goin 2 Sit at that fine restaurant 2 eat a special breakfast/lunch/brunch/dinner as d case maybe

Not knowing that d person that was 2 restock D store has bought THIS SPECIAL ANOINTED GUTTED OiL 
2411 2018-12-09 19:20:17 Trump isn't going to tweet about oil anytime soon. He just lost. He's a loser. Why would have want to bring attention to that now? They all ignored him and cut. He isn't going to change their opinion/action by tweeting more. OPEC won, Trump lost.
2412 2018-12-09 19:20:17 Ironic tossed off the oil looking for oil
2413 2018-12-09 19:20:16  before oil money 
2414 2018-12-09 19:20:09 imagine pple scooping cooking oil from a gutter; imagine the sight of children picking food from a bin or dunghill, then you will understand
2415 2018-12-09 19:20:02 Soon my employer wont even need you....
2416 2018-12-09 19:20:00 Building the Epic Pipeline will make New Mexico an even greater oil powerhouse - allowing us to increase production levels, provide more jobs, and strengthen our state’s economy! Click here to sign your name and show your support!
2417 2018-12-09 19:19:58 Any plans of launching #Teala in India. We are an oil dependent country with rising level of air pollution. We need cars that do not pollute @nitin_gadkari
2418 2018-12-09 19:19:48 No my dogs are pretty much always with me. Though one would stay out all day winter or summer.  Other wants to be with us. 
And it’s cold here but her coat is extremely thick n labs were built to pull fishing nets in off Labrador! Why feet web n oil in their coats. Like ducks 
2419 2018-12-09 19:19:45 Tax the hell out of big oil companies like Exxon-Mobil, Shell, BP, and Total S.A. Use that money to build better mass transit for the poor and working class. Give them transportation credits and subsidies. Corporations should bear the full brunt of the Carbon Tax, not the poor.
2420 2018-12-09 19:19:44 I don’t think we’re cheering. But we should definitely learn from this before trying to implement a carbon tax here. It cannot be  structured to hit workers hardest, or they will revolt, playing right into Trump and Big Oil’s slippery hands.
2421 2018-12-09 19:19:40 It’s a choice governments make with businesses and sometimes state run oil producers to keep up that energy rather than investing in renewables more strongly. We killed the electric car in the 2000s because of lobbying. I think blaming consumers is mad
2422 2018-12-09 19:19:37 So I’m winning!! Ant took it upon himself to oil my scalp!!! I’m in heaven
2423 2018-12-09 19:19:36 Whoa. Drop the oil and ask whatever happened to moving forward with clean renewable energy sources
2424 2018-12-09 19:19:34 The first oil deposits to go out of business will the the ones that are hard to extract & refine. That's tar sands. 
The price will collapse when there is a 2 million barrel per day surplus internationally. That's gonna happen in the next 2 years...just from EV adoption.
2425 2018-12-09 19:19:25 I HATE getting my damn oil changed... They come up with a million other things that's wrong with your car Just change my damn oil sheesh
2426 2018-12-09 19:19:23 New to Macdon 2008 build 40ft twin reel. On a claas 670. Reel speed erratic mornings fine heat of the day fast slow fast slow as evening approaches and weather cools is fine again. Oil good sensors good. Been able to sort all issues thus far. Last 3 days
2427 2018-12-09 19:19:19 Bio oil and any thick body butter
2428 2018-12-09 19:19:04 Money from gas and oil and other industries that accelerate climate change needs to be considered as bad as gun/NRA money. Mass extinction is *at least* as atrocious as a mass shooting, right? Right??
2429 2018-12-09 19:18:59 Why not allocate cows and goats too? How can a state own oil block in another state? Allocate Dangote to every state too. This is death to Nigeria. Allow each state develop on its pace with its resources. I have NEVER seen this type of malnourished economics

2431 2018-12-09 19:18:40 But George you r telling govt to smear good oil on a skin with leprosy. That ( that u r suggesting) jeeps us as peasant economies . I don't really know any that has developed with that kind
2432 2018-12-09 19:18:37 Little macro don’t know what he saying he is to little for that staff ! Hey Marco you can’t destroy Saudi ! Iran will take all over the oil and region ! Jamal khashogi was Fake news maker he was enemy of his people ! He got what he deserved ! Please go sleep man !
2433 2018-12-09 19:18:31 As oil-yuan-gold gains more market share, and therefore credibility, at what point would the rmb rise even against strong usd?
2434 2018-12-09 19:18:31 And then Alberta can pay back the 3 billion plus per year in direct subsidies to the oil industry
2435 2018-12-09 19:18:24 I'm sure you already knew it! If not, we're gonna have to wrestle.. Just make sure you grab the coconut oil when it goes down.  
2436 2018-12-09 19:18:18 Yes, but we’ll always need to keep oil and refineries in the US because of those key petrochemicals. Importing all of those would be economically disastrous.
2437 2018-12-09 19:18:14 It started to crumble the minute Obama took office, Hillary Clinton became SOC, the Libya debacle,w/ its proximity to Europe,& lack of following through after Gaddafi was murdered. Imperialistic Globalist opened the doors to chaos & mass migration in exchange for oil,money,&gold
2438 2018-12-09 19:18:12 I tried acupuncture I'm afraid it didn't work. But Thank God for CBD oil it's definitely allowing me to live my life a little bit more. Mind you what I tried was just swallowing the oil itself not using a lotion. Do you have a link for it? I should give it a try
2439 2018-12-09 19:18:02 Oil? Not sure for how long. Whisky ... not sure that yields enough to underpin an economy. I’m not naive enough to think that’s all they’ve got, but ...
2440 2018-12-09 19:18:02 @UAlberta_Eng literally invented the Alberta oil sands extraction industry & works to improve it still. And working on inventing the next 100 industries, despite funding cutbacks & other obstacles. These are the jobs for my great-grandchildren. Think past the next election #ABleg
2441 2018-12-09 19:18:00 Maduro: All Venezuelan Oil Will Be Sold In Petro Cryptocurrency

2446 2018-12-09 19:17:31 Ooh that reminds me.. crap why did I go after big oil! Hahaha #TwitterIsForever
2447 2018-12-09 19:17:16 IMO, a JUST transition for oil workers is important, but not a sweet deal. For years, many oil workers swam in $, while many of us scrimped and saved, knowing that hard times were coming, as they always do. So if they didn't put some money away and sell their fancy trucks ...
2448 2018-12-09 19:17:16 Ice fishing is fun you just need to shave your sack clean and put a nice thick layer of whale oil on your scrotum to protect against frost bite
2449 2018-12-09 19:17:16 Do you do an environmental assessment of the oil you import from Nigeria and Saudia Arabia to fill your cars?
2450 2018-12-09 19:17:14 Made my kitchen smell awful by making my dog a Sunday brunch of duck eggs scrambled in olive oil with some cbd tincture for dogs and some of his fancy dog meat on top. He’s a millenial.

2452 2018-12-09 19:16:53 Still waiting on those jobs. New coal mines? Expansive environmental damage for petroleum exploration, and cash in the pockets of rich oil executives. Supporting murderous regimes justified by further lies. Out classed, over his head, needs to be out of office!

2462 2018-12-09 19:16:11 "Don't they realize that their oil money will be worthless after collapse?" EXACTLY!!! I just don't get it, are they literally this stupid? How stupid can a person be? Why is this so hard to understand? It's SO obvious!!  
2463 2018-12-09 19:16:06 Why are we still talking about this? Absolutely nothing can be done. He has plenty of money to buy support of his innocence. They are one of the few stable military presence in the mid east. They are the major  leading force in the global oil market. What exactly do we do Marc?
2464 2018-12-09 19:16:02 yeah Vaseline based ones sounds like they wouldn’t work. I use those round eos lip balms and they seem to work well with liquid lips! I’ve heard that lip scrubs help too and tbh they’re straight up just smashed hard candy and olive oil so worth trying either way cuz they’re yummy
2465 2018-12-09 19:15:56 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
To those number-crunching guys:
If WTI trading could be calculated by barrels counting, we are all millionaires now. The market behaviors are not the results of counting barrels but due to the chart patterns which are the footprints of human herd mentality.

2467 2018-12-09 19:15:54 @AndrewScheer World oil nations control oil not the people of any country, at least Trudeau has a plan not just the Doug Ford model , PAY the RICH , NO to that.

2479 2018-12-09 19:14:33 You are absolutely correct, Alberta should have left confederation long ago and that way it wouldn't have "frittered away" its oil wealth by gifting it to Canada. Low oil prices? Only in Alberta and because the Trudeau Gov't blocked 3 pipelines.
2480 2018-12-09 19:14:33 E se dietro tutto questo buonismo politico e questa accoglienza di immigrati, ci fosse solo il prezzo da pagare al west Africa per lo sfruttamento italiano dei loro giacimenti petroliferi ?
Lo sapete tutti vero, che l'Italia è in prima fila per progetti oil & gas in west Africa ?
2481 2018-12-09 19:14:31 I've found acupuncture to be helpful. Also, a lotion including CBD oil, peppermint, and a bunch of other stuff.

2484 2018-12-09 19:14:22 No I have olive oil and a little bit of water
2485 2018-12-09 19:14:11 There are two shocks in this reality;
1. Absent current uneconomic business models, oil production is at tremendous risk of supply without shocking price increases.
2. If prices do increase, the tax income will either have to drop shockingly, or assume huge economic inflation.

2489 2018-12-09 19:13:52 I sabi check oil..
2490 2018-12-09 19:13:52 nope.  not really.  either their skilled enough to do it or its just nature in action.  though if you were on the top pouring oil on the side and laughing about it while they do it. thats a different story.
2491 2018-12-09 19:13:46 
2492 2018-12-09 19:13:43 dabbed the fuck out at auto zone trying to figure out what oil my car needs....truly a sight to see
2493 2018-12-09 19:13:40 What’s the price our neighbor is paying for Alberta’s crude oil, looks like just increased to 35% of the market standard? Interesting people......
2494 2018-12-09 19:13:36 My step father, grandfather, father before and before so on and so on, worked in the coal mines in the hollers of Ohio... they were dirt poor couldn't afford clothes and shoes or even electricity they used oil lamps, why would you want to bring this back?
2495 2018-12-09 19:13:35 Oil, whisky... I wouldn't take it too lightly, personally I would prefer to keep Scotland in the Union, but I do understand why they want to be independent

2498 2018-12-09 19:13:30 A workplace can be democratically run and worker-owned. Actually, scratch that, they *SHOULD* be democratically run and worker-owned. But the workers at the pizza joint don't have a say in the workplace of the oil change shop.

Honestly, it's not hard, Eugene, do try to keep up.

2504 2018-12-09 19:12:56 Im not worried about climate change. Also there is likely so mich shale oil in canada it could dwarf the oilsands. Hasn't been evaluated yet
2505 2018-12-09 19:12:42 Spot on Arthur. They had a Heritage Fund and pissed that away on a lack of sales tax. Now they don't have jobs they want hand-outs. Sort your patch out and then we can talk about a fair Canada. Look at the way Norway is using it's oil.

2509 2018-12-09 19:12:00 Holy crap. I have never seen this. Amazing that we're still creating refugees across the middle east to this day. Look at Yemen. PNAC was all about control of Global natural resources (ex. oil), and so no surprise the middle east is STILL being stirred up by our foreign policy.
2510 2018-12-09 19:11:52 Sickens me that cannabis oil is not made an option for everyone!

2512 2018-12-09 19:11:46 We all know that it's directly related to Trump... He was even talking about OPEC producing oil at a rate that is lowering gas prices but O'bummer and his Democrat kronys want us in an accord that is CONTRIBUTING to the riots in Paris which includes raising gas prices.
2513 2018-12-09 19:11:46 CAW! I'm at work. Daydreaming about buxom, butch cyborgs during lunch. Big, stronk, and able to flatten oil drums between their boobs...~

2520 2018-12-09 19:10:48 This is the real situation with Nigerian. It's true the oil price fell.

2532 2018-12-09 19:09:47 No , no.  he means Oil , and where they get it from, is none of anyone's business except Quebec's. Nothing but head games over there when it comes to something important that might help the whole country. They will buy from the most evil nations before they would do that.
2533 2018-12-09 19:09:42 I kinda want to try that thing where you put coconut oil in your hair and then bleach it with really weak developer but I’m scared of doing it wrong and too cheap to pay anybody to apply it for me
2534 2018-12-09 19:09:39 Finally, there are oil and natural gas production trends that were begun under George W. Bush and not stopped during Obama - though they were regulated during his administration - that have been accelerated & expanded under Trump. And the reversal on coal is entirely new.
2535 2018-12-09 19:09:15 Tf does coconut oil do with suede??
2536 2018-12-09 19:09:11 Oh ya? I thought it was just oil and ag. What other industries/sectors are there in AB?

Or electricity.

2541 2018-12-09 19:08:16 The world has had war forever. The world will have war forever. After we go to an electric economy, the rare earth requirements will also cause war. It is what it is. To pretend there is some world without war if we just stop using oil is naiveté at its worst.
2542 2018-12-09 19:08:07 Sure remember the Scottish referendum both labour and the tories had a field day they even broke all the purdah rules went on tv and tridnto skew the vote and hoodwink the Scottish citizens to vote no so they could keep Scotland’s oil resources to fund england .
2543 2018-12-09 19:08:04 You are full of shit,show me the data where any oil spill wasn’t cleaned up by the company,not by the government and how it was ten times as much.

2545 2018-12-09 19:08:01 The hell with our oil industry.
The future is renewable.
Focus on that
2546 2018-12-09 19:07:54 Those are NOT Alberta oil companies, that's the whole point!
2547 2018-12-09 19:07:37 I have really oily skin. 
I use black soap at night and beauty formula oil control cleanser in the morning. 

I just got the ordinary lactic acid, glycolic toning solution and niacinamide, thayers toner, beauty formulas facial tonic, cetaphil moisturizer. 

How do I use them ?
2548 2018-12-09 19:07:25 Yeah but academics are not as hard working as everyone (read oil and gas) else? Right? Even though we contribute just as much, if not more, to industry. The double standard is sickening.
2549 2018-12-09 19:07:25 Blood and coco oil wtf
2550 2018-12-09 19:07:14 Avocado oil sounds dank as hell
2551 2018-12-09 19:07:04 Brilliant idea, Einstein. Only one problem...ocean rise due to burning Alberta oil won't be enough to get you a coastline. And BC will happily tell YOU to fuck off if you ask to borrow theirs. #OilShill
2552 2018-12-09 19:06:56 Good luck selling your oil in cash comrades
2553 2018-12-09 19:06:55 All the PhD sociologists and anthropologists agree.
2554 2018-12-09 19:06:49 That wasn't nearly as bad as anticipated. New rear main seal and oil pan gasket installed, along with the flywheel, clutch, and bellhousing. Slow progress is still progress
2555 2018-12-09 19:06:41 Is there an essential oil to help me pass finals?
2556 2018-12-09 19:06:40 That could be taken a few ways . It's *lovely* that people are so kind and caring that they'll come check your oil. I've had *friends* check on me while I'm hiking to make sure I get home safe... there are some gems out there!
2557 2018-12-09 19:06:31 I don't think we won't see very soon a hike in oil prices. We all know the US is the De facto ruler of global oil policy.
2558 2018-12-09 19:06:18 And why can't we have both oil and renewable's in a transition?  And maybe a lot less tribalism (it's getting as bad as US politics).

2563 2018-12-09 19:05:50 Disney People: Walt Disney was super smart to keep buying land under different names so he could get it for cheap.

I’m fun, I swear.
2564 2018-12-09 19:05:41 Oil change n car wash asap
2565 2018-12-09 19:05:30 Oil, natural gas and coal to the exclusion of all other sources of energy. An essential rejection of the concept of regulation or concern for the climate. And making the U.S. the world's largest oil player based on domestic production & exports. The latter is a radical change.

2. सऊदी अरब से तेल की कीमतों पर रोक लगाने
की मांग पर सहमति

इसके बाद भी यदि आप 2019 में Chhota Bheem के Fan को PM बनाना चाहते हो तो आपको आपकी मूर्खता मुबारक हो।
2568 2018-12-09 19:04:52 They seem to be working towards these goals. Oil isn’t dying and whatever industry if you are employeed affects you and everyone else in Canada. Think before you tweet

2574 2018-12-09 19:04:17 washing my face with cerave foaming wash twice a day, using pixi toner, cerave moisturizer, physicians formula organic glow oil during the day, pixi overnight glow oil at night, exfoliating with pixi peel and polish twice a week, and using charcoal and African black soap masks!
2575 2018-12-09 19:04:14 He is fussy but does go out for meals. He's strictly no palm oil and the like so always wants to know ingredients.  Will check out some restaurants
2576 2018-12-09 19:04:12 It sends chills to my spine, because some of the buyers of that oil could be buka owners 
2577 2018-12-09 19:03:52 jacob changed the oil in my jeep, rotated my tires, and filled up my gas tank when i was getting my hair done. what did i do to deserve this man. 
2578 2018-12-09 19:03:17 Trump clearly has no leverage over ROPEC and even Iran doesn't care. They are committed to selling oil up until a war happens. Trump is a joke in the middle east.
2579 2018-12-09 19:03:10 I have a lot of FRIENDS I am so thankful for! Someone stopped by today to check my oil 
2580 2018-12-09 19:03:03 Good point sir but u are not spared yourself bcos you were at the helm of power for about 16 years and Nigeria still doesn’t have constant electricity supply.U also created more individual millionaires through oil blocks allotment and other nefarious means.
2581 2018-12-09 19:03:03 I need to be nice to my baby fava this week so he can change my oil
2582 2018-12-09 19:03:00 The resulting gas is expensive. Saudi oil is economic. But @GasBuddyDan mows good grass on the wisdom of energy independence. Not sure about it reducing emissions though.

2585 2018-12-09 19:02:52 No no no! We’d be like Peurto RICO then. Ouch! They’d take all our oil and leave us cold and dark.....maybe with a roll of paper towel. Non bueno.
2586 2018-12-09 19:02:41 A pipeline is the safest way to transport oil.
2587 2018-12-09 19:02:35 “Our” oil!!!
2588 2018-12-09 19:02:25 If you’re looking for natural, coconut oil or avocado oils might help 
2589 2018-12-09 19:02:19 Too late.  Look at Bear Butte and Alaska.  Greed for oil has taken those lands.  What now?
2590 2018-12-09 19:02:15 Check ingredients for Palm oil!
2591 2018-12-09 19:02:11 We make a fennel salad at Christmas time that does not taste harsh with that licorice flavor. It’s refreshing with thinly sliced Vidalia onion, paper thin pieces of celery, pine nuts, fresh squeezed lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. So good
2592 2018-12-09 19:02:11 And we STILL wouldn’t have a way to get our oil to tidewater.  Why can’t we build a refinery and and process it Ourselves?would 5e total cost be more than the 80 per day we are losing now?
2593 2018-12-09 19:01:54 the Nobel's were an oil family.

2595 2018-12-09 19:01:49 i cant wait until this damn mct oil kicks in
2596 2018-12-09 19:01:32 There is more oil under Alaska than the middle East ever had. It is silly that we ever had to import at all.
2597 2018-12-09 19:01:26 Whenever I administer the Sacrament of Baptism, I always smell the Chrism before the post-Baptismal anointing. I tell people I’m just checking to make sure I grabbed the right oil stock, but it’s really because I just happen to love the scent of Sacred Chrism!!
2598 2018-12-09 19:01:23 Shouldn’t be using foreign oil,,
2599 2018-12-09 19:00:46 And coal. Vancouver exports more coal than any port in North America. But oil; that's too dirty! Idiots like Karen need to shut their mouths lest they irrefutably prove their cluelessness. Oops! Too late.
2600 2018-12-09 19:00:39 @oxladeofficial ur oil no go dry
2601 2018-12-09 19:00:37 Omg I bet all that oil and sodium lol

2603 2018-12-09 19:00:25 Are you thinking that will get our oil to the Coast? Be smarter, pls. No separation!
2604 2018-12-09 19:00:23 @kaifulee on @FareedZakaria: 'Data is the new oil, #China is the new #SaudiArabia". Sobering account of Chinese advances in #technology, #CustomerService, as #US falls behind. (Try ordering something from @JoAnn_Stores)
2605 2018-12-09 19:00:21 Quit drinking the Todes initiated Kool-Aid, this is exactly what the US wants.  Sell our oil at less than market, they refine it, consume it, and export theirs for further profit.  We are in this predicament because Justine wants to finish what his father started.
2606 2018-12-09 19:00:21 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
2607 2018-12-09 19:00:13 My hair is dying for some aloe vera and a hot oil treatment 
2608 2018-12-09 19:00:06 You keep trying to sell that snake oil but I see through you
2609 2018-12-09 19:00:03 Obama didn't expand anything.. shovel ready, cash for clunkers, solyndra and 40 other green energy projects were massive failures.. his stock market was carried by big oil, new drilling techniques and fracking investments.. go buy a brain..
2610 2018-12-09 18:59:59 Saudi's are subsidizing your gas as they continue to buy up your oil rights, refineries and pipelines.....
2611 2018-12-09 18:59:55 I use your Hemp Oil and it is far superior to all the others I have tried!!! Love it!
2612 2018-12-09 18:59:52 Wanneer organiseert deze wereld een grootse top à la #COP24 om maatregelen te nemen voor Jemen? Het miljoenencircus in #Katowice leidt mogelijk tot niets en ondertussen voltrekken de ergst denkbare menselijke drama's zich in een door oorlog verscheurd land. 

No oil? No use...
2613 2018-12-09 18:59:50 An average Nigerian is wicked and really doesn’t care how his/her action(s)affects the next person especially when they’d be milking or making profits out of it.
The gutter oil scooping video proves that again.
Most innocent people will be the victims of what we saw in that video
2614 2018-12-09 18:59:44 All I want for Christmas is an oil change and my car detailed. I hate being an adult.
2615 2018-12-09 18:59:38 Ha!  With Oil and Guns!  That'll piss them all off.
2616 2018-12-09 18:59:34 A pesar de los pedidos de #Trump de precios de petróleo+bajos, el Cartel de la #OPEP recortó la producción en 1.2mm barriles al día. Medida que por la fuerte industria del shale oil en #USA, tendrá un impacto en el corto plazo.
2617 2018-12-09 18:59:33 And to think that these people will be looking at the ones not packing oil as 'not smart'.
2618 2018-12-09 18:59:26 Yeah, it takes a while for hair to acclimate to being bleached. Mine was like that the first year and a half. Eventually ur head adapts and makes a different chemical balance for ur hair to keep it healthy. Getting cocoanut oil conditioner helped tons as well
2619 2018-12-09 18:59:25 These protests over inequality are not totally unjustified; however, every Western government should literally guarantee appropriate financing of alternate non oil gas based vehicles. Turn in your gas run vehicle to govt. crush them & re use metal & parts for other purposes.
2620 2018-12-09 18:59:24 Ini bio oil?
2621 2018-12-09 18:59:09 A vicious snarling dog head, but from the neck down you can see spindly female legs that are bloodied and shaking.
2622 2018-12-09 18:58:45 Oh right then, so continuing my olive theme...I just tried to open a bottle of olive oil (with a plastic loop seal) and talk on the phone simultaneously, and the bottle won, but my nice jumper didn’t so there ya go, mates...
2623 2018-12-09 18:58:43 The Stelmach Alberta PC government invested in Sturgeon Refinery phase 1. It was a major project. Now, the Notley #abndp govt will invest in Phase 2 and other projects to upgrade Alberta's oil to ship value added product at a world price rather than the ridiculously low US price.
2624 2018-12-09 18:58:26 Is that an oil painting?!

2626 2018-12-09 18:58:14 I am not worried about the 'democracy' of the system.

I am worried about the irreparable damage being done to our environment and wildlife through destruction and death.

You can't fix destruction though oil drilling and you can't fix death or extinction of wildlife.
2627 2018-12-09 18:58:12 25/11 In 2016 and 2017, 71% of the energy financing of the main French banks went to coal, oil and gas, against 20% to renewables. It's decided, I put my savings under my mattress !
2628 2018-12-09 18:58:09 I would love to know the date when you first prophesied energy dependency and the US oil trade stats at that time.
2629 2018-12-09 18:58:03 The idea that there could be any sort of 'balance' between those elements is a myth. You are implying we should put millions of lives, global ecosystems, entire economies and future generations at risk, just to temporarily protect the oil industry.
2630 2018-12-09 18:58:03 Breaking news: the lawsuit with real fact findings about the true perpetrators of 9/11 is finally being allowed to proceed. The evil military complex, powerful big oil, genocidal Israel, and the crazy Saudis will have to face the public for their crimes against the world.
2631 2018-12-09 18:57:50 Oil change and tire change isn’t needed as often as food in your belly 
2632 2018-12-09 18:57:48 42nd. Only competed 170 laps due to oil pump issues.
2633 2018-12-09 18:57:47 All that Scotish oil and gas has subsidised you for a long time... 200 billion economy plus repatriation of oil and gas revenues looks good for the 5.5 million people in Scotland as an independent nation.

>> The USA is NOT Running out of OIL !!!! <>>>
Not being explained to the American people as to why Russia needs to be demonized, is due to what is now being called “The Great Oil Crash of 2018”—
2638 2018-12-09 18:57:13 @narendramodi जी की विदेशनीति के 2 शानदार उदाहरण

1. ईरान से Crude Oil के बदले पेमेंट भारतीय ₹ में होने पर रजामंदी

2. सऊदी अरब से तेल की कीमतों पर रोक लगाने
की मांग पर सहमति

इसके बाद भी यदि आप 2019 में #Chhota_Bheem के Fan को PM बनाना चाहते हो तो आपको आपकी मूर्खता मुबारक हो।
2639 2018-12-09 18:57:11 How about oil, onions, garlic, celery, carrots, leeks,tomatoes, tomato puree, veg stock, cauliflower, peas, shredded cabbage, swede, pearl barley, potato, turnip, lentils, seasoning, herbs; it's a good anything goes soup, can use odds and ends of past their best veg.

2646 2018-12-09 18:56:35 Wow!
I’ve heard our Midnight Oil is amazing!!
But look at these wonderful results!!
2647 2018-12-09 18:56:29 Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Do not use hair styling gels. Stay away from products with parabens. Is it NISIM or NHB? A shampoo to controls hair loss. or very close to. How must I determine the appropriate source. Best shampoo ever. Need to buy some.
2648 2018-12-09 18:56:18 Heating Oil 2.699 - Kerosene $3.149  Diesel prices are dependent on taxes the State imposes. Home heating oil isn't taxed.

2652 2018-12-09 18:55:56 So there is one thing about modern Republicans that the original Republicans also failed at. While they were spreading equality among freed slaves Native Americans were forced off land on death marches, yes Lincoln - to clear land for a new nation.
-or Canadian Oil pipiline Trump
2653 2018-12-09 18:55:51 W. making up evidence to lead the country into war just to make money for oil barons and weapons industry is close to treason. Is he only saved because these oil barons and weapons manufacturers were American?
2654 2018-12-09 18:55:50 It’s 100% what i have been doing with the big stocks. Playing oil swings among other sectors  lately been doing ok with it so liquid love that. I’m done with CSE AND TSXV stocks.
2655 2018-12-09 18:55:49 “Data is the new oil, and China is Saudi Arabia”: @kaifulee ... excellent segment on CNN today. His “A.I. Superpowers” book is a must read for those wanting a view on how the #ArtificialIntelligence race will influence geopolitics in the coming years

Scusi signor Salvini, ma questo twitt mi fa pensare.
Potrebbe essere più chiaro ?
6 € al giorno in Ghana sono 1000 Ghana cedis al mese, la paga di un operaio.
2661 2018-12-09 18:55:20 Nah I gotta wait till I change my oil this week for that sadly plus i'm already going to a smash fest in HS lol.  I feel you on a spiritual level on the internet issues though.
2662 2018-12-09 18:54:36 After extensive research on the internet I have determined, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that my persistent oil leak could be caused by almost anything.
2663 2018-12-09 18:54:34 Who knows how to do oil changes and have good customer service and the willingness to work
2664 2018-12-09 18:54:28 @ZaftigEnigma @xoBrittanyox91 @notadeb  ty for this amazing opportunity! I really need cleansing oil ! I'm so excited for this ty for the chance! I praying I will win my skin really needs this!!!!

2677 2018-12-09 18:52:53 The US state department is the new US propaganda network. We should call out the Trump administration on this #AntiCorruptionDay. They will do anything to undermine the Iranian government, even support & endorse terrorists - all for oil, money & war profiteering.
2678 2018-12-09 18:52:50 Finally changing my breaks and oil
2679 2018-12-09 18:52:49 Chinese oil imports climb to a record 10.47M B/D in November, customs data shows. IHS Markit says shipments up as refiners exhaust quotas and raise runs toward year-end to meet annual targets #OOTT @business
2680 2018-12-09 18:52:44 why does mustard oil have a weed like after taste...
2681 2018-12-09 18:52:34 I always put leave in and oil in my daughter’s hair when she get her protective styles. My mother in law wasn’t doing that and she had serious breakage.
2682 2018-12-09 18:52:26 Interfering with other countries affairs have massive consequences 
How about this:
When would Saudi stop oil sales to UK 

Ohh  what a limited mindset corbyn!!
2683 2018-12-09 18:52:19 Please remember that oil is used for lots of petrochemicals that modern life depends on. It’s not just used for fuel.
2684 2018-12-09 18:51:41 .@cantubeauty Hair and Scalp oil has been a dream. Use it as my leave in but I had to take a break my area doesn’t sell it!!  #blackgirlinawhitetownprobs #naturalhair #curlyhair #missmyhairproducts

2687 2018-12-09 18:51:29 The approach comes from frustration. The majority of Canadians either knows nothing about Alberta oil and gas or simply don't care. I would also venture to say the majority of protesters don't even understand what they're protesting about.
2688 2018-12-09 18:51:25 Yea but if PDP have laid a good foundation when oil is booming without opec cut and high cost of crude at international market this young boy couldn't have suffer but they rather secure his share of money for their unborn generation
2689 2018-12-09 18:51:21 Have you tried smoking? Or some form of edible or oil? That's the only thing that really helps my stomach.
2690 2018-12-09 18:51:19 cant blame Quebec for the price of oil. also, few of your followers are Quebecers. Scotty
2691 2018-12-09 18:51:18 My house is primarily heated by natural gas, but I’ve still got a back up oil heating system... it costs a fortune to run, so I never use it...

2) where is the anointing oil, rosary, Bible, speaking in tongues and binding and casting? Amateurs
2695 2018-12-09 18:50:42 You know Onion, pure salt, olive oil...are all used in killing demons... They're demons that's their problem

2704 2018-12-09 18:50:02 Alberta’s economy centers around oil and gas. Are you suggesting that the “keep it in the ground” anti-pipeline movement does not have sympathizers in left-wing party leadership?  Not even from the ex-prez of the World Wildlife Fund?
2705 2018-12-09 18:49:59 I need a cleansing oil bath or something

2707 2018-12-09 18:49:52 "The people who consume by far the least need to consume less. It's only fair, because people who own multiple yachts that consume more oil to move an inch than poor people do a year have to pay a bit more for their gas."

Jesus fucking Christ dude, shut the fuck up.
2708 2018-12-09 18:49:51 There's barely a spark of humanity in it, although I suppose being about oil execs and the CIA that's unsurprising

2711 2018-12-09 18:49:39 I will Goody but if only from my own garden, otherwise no.

It is a brilliant simple culinary dance, that starts with the the proper flour, I suggest Molino, and fresh garlic but equally being patient when cooking the garlic. The final stroke is choice of olive oil. Run wild.
2712 2018-12-09 18:49:38 "Is it more likely that a lazy idiot rises to the helm of a global oil company, or is elected President of the United States?"

2721 2018-12-09 18:48:53 Find a good hair oil (I use a mix of JBCA, lavender, teatree, rosemary n peppermint). Invest in a shampoo, conditioner. Deep condition once a week!

2726 2018-12-09 18:48:34 The best tool used by the 1% to reduce the citizenry to impoverished, rights-free slaves is to make it so you'd have to have a literacy level above gr. 12 to understand how they stole Iraq's oil, took music and film sharing out of our impoverished hands, disenfranchised us, etc.
2727 2018-12-09 18:48:29 Here's and easy one for you and Trump Proverbs 12:22 Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight.

By the way I can swap Bible verses all day. Yo and your snake oil president will always pervert Scripture.

2730 2018-12-09 18:48:00 Trump lives off their oil he doesn’t care.
2731 2018-12-09 18:47:54 Also the conservative witch hunt of Obama being a Muslim. Not that it really matters his religion. But sure let's all support a guy that really hasn't done anything this week but tweet and go to the Army/Navy game. Anyone that voted for Trump got sold snake oil. Suckas.
2732 2018-12-09 18:47:50 We have a new process now. No smell, no smoke and better results. Got rid of the used motor oil we used to use and upgraded to self-quenching, heat treating oil. No worry of flare ups and no smell like before. Unfortunately the tempering process still smells awful.

2738 2018-12-09 18:47:05 I'm shocked that you are saying things are worse, do you mean fuel and cooking oil shortages? Do you understand the issue of foreign currency shortages? Zimbabweans are shopping in SA and Dubai using the little foreign currency in Zim. Zim is importing more than it exports.
2739 2018-12-09 18:47:04 Interestingly, OPEC, ExxonMobil, and other major providers of crude oil, know exactly what the United States can afford.
Don't you find this slightly suspicious?
By the way, I am not a believer in the global warming conspiracy theory.
2740 2018-12-09 18:46:49 Getting my oil changed gives me anxiety bc I know they’re gunna ask me questions I just don’t have the answers to
2741 2018-12-09 18:46:41 “Lt.Col.” was forced to retire to avoid court marshall and is a right wing fringe loon.  As the daughter of a West Point grad, @ProtectHarvest’s support of him is disappointing.
2742 2018-12-09 18:46:32 Mozzarella is cheese, which is fat, which is bad for you, and “sticks” are fried, which is oil, which is fat, which is bad for you.
Plus, dairy cows are imprisoned, tortured (then murdered) sentient animals. Also, animal agriculture is the biggest contributor to global warming.
2743 2018-12-09 18:46:28 i would love to help unfortunately i dont have any rso in fact i havent even made it before i make infused coconut oil but i dont know if that has the same effect?

2745 2018-12-09 18:46:21 This is not oil... this is what is called oiyel
2746 2018-12-09 18:46:16 while I admire the effort, this is a social problem as plastics are cheaply derived from the abundant portion of oil that can't easily be converted to usable fuel. People need to demand that government and business break the vicious disposable consumer culture.
2747 2018-12-09 18:45:47 Brent crude rose by US$1.61 or 2.7% to US$61.67 a barrel and the US Nymex price rose by US$1.12 or 2.2% to US$52.61 a barrel. Over the week Brent rose by US$2.96 or 5% with Nymex up US$1.68 or 3.3%.

2748 2018-12-09 18:45:44 It seems to mean the only reason Tillerson was brought on to Trumps team was the $500 Billion Dollar Exxon Deal with Putin and the Russian Oil Industry. Exxon is the only Co. that has the equipment to extract the oil in Russia.  When they couldn’t get it done, he was removed.
2749 2018-12-09 18:45:40 The oil go get correct taste
2750 2018-12-09 18:45:33 This statement is a joke, and the only thing it tells is is how @LindseyGrahamSC and Obama squad are disparate!!

And i want to remind this guy that it’s not about “Oil imports” you silly if we stop selling oil in dollars American the next day will be hungry.. so cut the crab
2751 2018-12-09 18:45:16 Oil prices epitomize the whole problem: it's about the elite treating regular people like shit, the government giving tax breaks to the richest and putting massive amount of taxes on everyone. Then there's calling everyone racist, sexist, homophobic, uneducated, when they say no.
2752 2018-12-09 18:45:16 Reserves still won’t get us stacks of oil money short of a massive shortage of oil and that’s not happening anything soon
2753 2018-12-09 18:45:12 Thanks! They arent original granted but Im proud of them, esspecially since I did these freehand and using traditional mediums.

2755 2018-12-09 18:45:11 Honestly probably a really good job or I would have started a business that earns me more than an oil company job would have

2759 2018-12-09 18:44:54 CSR came from PSU companies. ONGC Rs 50 crore, IOCL Rs 21.83 crore, BPCL, HPCL, OIL Rs 25 crore each. This is also government money. 

If government is borrowing billions of dollars for managing deficit, and taking 500 million to build a statue, what will you count it under?
2760 2018-12-09 18:44:30 Brownie tips.  Use more oil than the recipe calls for and your brownies will stay wonderfully gooey.  Too much is too much.  Experiment. When your brownies are hot out of the oven turn them over on a plate and drip nutella on them.  Spread thinly to prevent moisture loss.
2761 2018-12-09 18:44:29 Anyway oil was being sold in American USD. So it was as if being extracted on US soil. like it was part of the American economy. There was cheap money from the Feds at lower than 1.5%, an opportunity was taken and oil companies made Money on cheap investing

2780 2018-12-09 18:42:35 With Trudeau BC and QC effectively killing AB energy, AB and SK need to reconsider confederation. If oil is ending, AB and SK need to retain the wealth and chart a new independent course. Retain profits to build a new economy and country. Continue to bleed & support Can otherwise
2781 2018-12-09 18:42:34 Of course it’s for Putin and the Saudis who live off oil and he lives of their .
2782 2018-12-09 18:42:34 “Rebuild” that’s one way to put it. It’s definitely not just a front so we can guard the heroine fields and oil fields to make our country money. Also it’s so we can hold our empire over the world. I’m not condoning the actions at all and I wish we’d just completely pull out.
2783 2018-12-09 18:42:29 With a red hot sauce and a touch of CeCe oil on it
2784 2018-12-09 18:42:22 Again, if we don't use it, it will be exported to the US.  The footprint is irrelevant and transportation of foreign oil across the ocean makes it essentially a wash.  Shale deposits have far higher other environmental impacts.  Also, we cannot afford to stop oil production.

Massive funding to Science education & the military to make it happen. And then there was US oil, the rise of Texas gold. So much was going on in 50s-60s.

And you are saying for fear of offending Iranians we shouldn't even be condemning their puppets?!!

When are we growing some backbone?
2857 2018-12-09 18:35:51 Jamaican black castor oil does, I use it everyday & I love it
2858 2018-12-09 18:35:46 Give it a try then, see how fast Petro-Canada, Enbridge, Shaw, WestJet, Imperial Oil all flee to BC and Ontario, it’s going to be the same as the banks all leaving Montreal for Toronto in 70s, they’re not going to risk losing their markets.
2859 2018-12-09 18:35:44 Always remember POWER;

2862 2018-12-09 18:35:34 The beetle is smoking from somewhere and the only explanation is oil so now it doesn’t drive anymore
2863 2018-12-09 18:35:30 So u exist?? Thot they created dis pic just to sale beard oil 
2864 2018-12-09 18:35:15 Looks excellent.. some top olive oil with that and your set!
2865 2018-12-09 18:35:09 You are really going to hate it when you find out why wages in the oil sands are much higher than in the city...
2866 2018-12-09 18:35:07 Kind of ..and I got this Seabuckthirn oil to try but man it turns your skin totally yellow /orange while it's on, so you look super jaundiced
2867 2018-12-09 18:35:00 @SLMLMbutok @ScamBamTYMaam @MLMRiot have you guys been following the Volo implosion? Interesting stuff. Follow-up episode?? There’s some angry people who wouldn’t mind talking. Classic snake oil stuff. Collect the $ then skip town. Samantha was on facebook selling their stuff.
2868 2018-12-09 18:34:59 I did.

Mass graduate unemployment the year I graduated.

Strange? No, how? Not odd at all, cos I never saw anybody out creating the grad jobs while I slogged at ma wee desk burning midnight oil

More and more gave it a go

Grads as common  as muck and working for no wage noo
2869 2018-12-09 18:34:57 at least they know how to deal with the Muslim takeover- they put them into camps.

2871 2018-12-09 18:34:48 Countries that rely on crude oil as their main source of revenues ar far worse than nigeria. Eg Venezuela and Algeria. For the 1st time in decades the non oil revenue surpased the oil revenue under PMB. We hav 2 diversify our economy. We hav 2 be able to feed on what we produce.
2872 2018-12-09 18:34:46 Commented on the essential oil blends post.
2873 2018-12-09 18:34:36 Northern European welfare states are funded by oil revenue.
2874 2018-12-09 18:34:30 So I got impatient af yesterday waiting for my oil change and left so I decided I’ll do it today myself and guess how much I spent on my oil change $14 
2875 2018-12-09 18:34:27 The oil business is different from natural gas. Natural gas/pipelines is traditionally much more centered on government-to-government relations. SEE can buy oil from anywhere. Just that Russian companies hold large assets in several countries - e.g. Bulgaria, Serbia
2876 2018-12-09 18:34:23 IVE LITERALLY TRIED EVERYTHING! Vaseline, Shea butter, every oil I own, I even put my fucking eczema cream on them!

2883 2018-12-09 18:33:48 Oh yea! Anyways. That’s tea tree oil, which is a bit different from tea itself.
2884 2018-12-09 18:33:43 The Oil under Hitchcock are going to move past the last game and play hockey, if they’re smart that is, not because of Peluso v McDavid, because it’s the only way they’ll beat the Flames. They play tough and take penalties, this Flames squad will light them up
2885 2018-12-09 18:33:35 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.

2890 2018-12-09 18:33:04 You are right, kclo4 is highly sensitive, i meant KCLO3 as you said. KCLO3+motor oil and a primer and you have some basic high explosive. With aluminum its pretty potent pyro mixture for strong firecrackers.
2891 2018-12-09 18:32:38 Why is @burnaboy burning like wild fire on every TL? Is it some sort of fresh oil?
2892 2018-12-09 18:32:23 So this is your own definition of richer or poorer and yet, you detailed all info on dollar and naira but deliberately left out the only thing Nigeria depends on, crude oil/barrel price as at then and now.
2893 2018-12-09 18:32:20 Andy, with respect, "messaging" on Twitter faces an avalanche of misinformation. No "messaging" would help. What would finally sink in would be oil flowing.
2894 2018-12-09 18:32:14 Lmao! Well maybe we should start first, but either way it goes we’re gonna be ready. We be trynna pour on the oil like we be seeing in porn hub and shit 
2895 2018-12-09 18:32:08 @clarins_uk hi - do you know when you’re going to get red berry glam in the Instant Light Lip Comfort Oil back in stock? Thanks
2896 2018-12-09 18:32:08 Sincerely there is no treason the man signed an MoU not agreement and the parliament rejected it. Now Farmajo, HSM and Kheire signed many agreements regarding oil and sea ports which are more dangerous than the MoU. Am not here to defend @AAbdishakur but we have to open our eyes
2897 2018-12-09 18:32:05 I like it. I have stopped trying to scrub things off because I irritated the hell out of my skin and that lasted longer than whatever I applied did. My go to is oil for anything that facial cleanser doesn't remove. If that or ponds cold cream doesn't take it off, I leave it be.
2898 2018-12-09 18:31:49 You'll buy the whole olive oil popcorn! but you'll only need the EDGE!
2899 2018-12-09 18:31:47 #asktalia If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
2900 2018-12-09 18:31:42 I cannot even believe that you are excusing this act of wickedness. Wow! So because she is poor, it means that she has no conscience or it means that it is okay for her endanger the lives of people that would buy this oil. This reply says a lot about you!

2902 2018-12-09 18:31:29 Bonsoir excusez moi est-ce que le Bi Oil c’est efficace contre les vergetures svp ?
2903 2018-12-09 18:31:21 Nice work! I actually use coconut oil (put in travel size shampoo bottles) as my Gatorade/gu/gel replacement.
2904 2018-12-09 18:31:16 Fry a bed of cooked rice in sesame oil in a cast iron skillet until the bottom begins to crisp. Crack some eggs over it, turn down heat and cover until eggs are done. Serve with soy sauce. Yum!
2905 2018-12-09 18:31:11 Alberta’s conservative Govts refused to support diversification, and invested in total dependency on US oil-market.
And pissed away your rainy-day fund.

Plenty, centuries, of jobs in Tar-Sands cleanup.
But the Oil Companies want Alberta’s and Canada’s taxpayers to pay for it.
2906 2018-12-09 18:31:10 We have such an abundance of oil that we are finally exporting it under Trump.
2907 2018-12-09 18:30:57 Boom, bust, and snivel is a perennial favourite for Albertans that I've had to listen to far to often.  The only thing more obnoxious than Them whining about Ottawa when the oil patch dries up is listening to them bitch about BC taxes and gas prices when they vacation here.

(石油の海洋汚染に関して、主な原因はタンカー事故であるという文を受け、)The rest is due to leak from oil field , smaller accidents or deliberate dumping.

2909 2018-12-09 18:30:37 Yes I agree. The French people can see through the lies of the leftists who want to redistribute hard earned wealth to the poor nations. They want to force us to develop alternate forms of energy for them so they have demonized oil and its users.
2910 2018-12-09 18:30:31 Everyone knows oil is an up and down field. You put money away during the up times for the down times. Alberta was cocky and entitled and now we are blaming the rest of Canada for our problems.

2912 2018-12-09 18:30:28 This is a no brainer.
YYC LIVES off the oil patch and our elected Officials should recognize this and represent the electorate by supporting local industry.
2913 2018-12-09 18:30:02 You get your water filtered from an import. You don't care about the water in the United States unless it's to frack oil for your 1% friends and you.
2914 2018-12-09 18:29:57 I thought oil companies in the US were one of the few industries paying the full rate of corporate tax, without the tricks other firms use?
2915 2018-12-09 18:29:51 Now why wouldn’t they keep oil flowing it is still being used. The price of oil shouldn’t fluctuate when MBS gets called out for being a murder. We should Place strict UN Sanctions on Saudi Arabia and limit the amount of oil they are allowed to sell also set the price for them!
2916 2018-12-09 18:29:51 We pay massive taxes for overthrowing Middle Eastern countries as big corporations, oil companies, and banks reap the profit from the countries our taxes paid to overthrow. You and I get none of the profit, just the bill.
2917 2018-12-09 18:29:47 "You really do know me too well." He may as well just take the fries. They'll all go to a good cause anyway. Steve will thank him later.

"And I've stopped questioning the oil. If I didn't know you up close and personal, I'd assume it's just your natural musk." Snort.
2918 2018-12-09 18:29:40 They've had the rest of the country by the balls for way too long, QC has been coddled, treated like the special child, given untold billions whenever they throw a temper tantrum. For them to block AB oil is close to treason.
2919 2018-12-09 18:29:29 Kill oil, deny unemployed AB wrkers, snub farmers (grain cars), takeaway CFB ColdLake=no$ can be sent. Q gets hatey again.
2920 2018-12-09 18:29:27 I was going to wait until Monday but if Wheatly is having trouble to repay the cake what is his response to the missing 5billion worth of oil???
2921 2018-12-09 18:29:15 "fucktarin mouth worm oil" -morgan
2922 2018-12-09 18:29:04 Because the fleet will take 10 years to age out, unless actively dismantled. Meanwhile oil supply will remain high and gas prices artificially low. Shipping more won't get us a better rate and wastes resources and human labour.
2923 2018-12-09 18:28:59 Babe this egusi no follow ooo, na so so red oil I dey see for ur plate ooo..

2927 2018-12-09 18:28:40 Anti-pipeline policy is a false flag used to divide Canadians. No pipeline means oil is transferred by truck or train, burning more fuel than transfer through a pipeline. Pipelines done properly minimizes pollution. The PPC is proud to defend Canada's development  #ProudtoBePPC
2928 2018-12-09 18:28:27 1.  Delhi will breathe better ...  visit to doctor will reduce .. 
2.  Petrol / oil producing nations will be impacted 
3.  Battery &  related industry will be sunshine industry 
4.  Like ATM machines - charging stations everywhere 
5.  Many industry leaders will emerge
2929 2018-12-09 18:28:26 Put drops of olive oil/pharmacy ear drops into his ear every night with cotton wool, then when this has been done for a week or two visit the GP and see if there’s any chance that he could get his ear seringed. I feel for him as I used to suffer from this all the time!
2930 2018-12-09 18:28:22 His failures belong to GW Bush and he takes credit for what Trump has done...this is what one should expect from a snake oil salesman?
2931 2018-12-09 18:28:13 Came across my tub of Vaseline I use to jerkoff with

I’m a coconut oil man now but the smell of the Vaseline turned me on for some reason 

Might have to use it today for old time sakes 
2932 2018-12-09 18:27:57 Hard to imagine anything increasing American manufacturing more than high oil prices. Anyone that thinks domestic drilling contractors are buying anything other than American made drilling and fracking equipment is fully ignorant of the business. Canadians as well.
2933 2018-12-09 18:27:36 Under Armour recovery sleepwear. Also has pockets.

2936 2018-12-09 18:26:57 So you’re ok with dumping my used oil and grease down the drain as it’s such a small percentage.  I might as well throw my trash out in a ditch somewhere too. Can’t do no harm. #smallpercentage #moelogic
2937 2018-12-09 18:26:46 My entire twenties, I had a bowl of brown rice with edamame and sesame oil for breakfast every day. And it was heavenly. This is a hill worth dying on.

2940 2018-12-09 18:26:17 Anyone who would choose a coal or oil powerplant over Nuclear has not done their research on the environmental impact. We are blessed to have access to Hydroelectric power.
2941 2018-12-09 18:26:12 The oil and gas in Alberta is owned by the crown.  The royalty is a tax on the production paid to the crown so where would that money magically go?
2942 2018-12-09 18:26:09 Tired of all pipeline & oil shipment propaganda on Twitter & endlessly promoted by Alberta Premier Notley, what about developing clean energy sources instead to improve our children's future rather than short-term, immediate financial rewards despite env. impacts?
2943 2018-12-09 18:26:05 Vitamin E skin oil! and cocoa butter!
2944 2018-12-09 18:25:44 Recycling, bins, accounts, lightbulbs, changing oil or a tyre, let me recount the tribulations of ms. IndieBookshop - oh remembering to feed the fish in the pond, anything to do with the vet
2945 2018-12-09 18:25:33 We do have a new refinery in Canada. It's in AB - the North West Refinery aka Sturgeon. It is having difficulty with economics. It's owned in part by Albertans and it receives royalties-in-kind (oil accepted instead of cash from producers).
2946 2018-12-09 18:25:29 The reality is expanding economy, rising wages, America No. oil producer, lowest unemployment in decades. Abroad toughness towards Russia, China, Iran. It was Obama who lived in a fantasy world. A punching bag 4 Putin.
2947 2018-12-09 18:25:14 So Quebec continues to buy Saudi Arabian oil because the Saudi's CAN'T DIVERSIFY their economy????
2948 2018-12-09 18:25:06 I'm still stuck on speedway but I've noted your feelings about oil ocean :P
2949 2018-12-09 18:25:02 Y is Mariah Carey so stiff??? Can she plz move like a normal person instead of the tin man when he need more oil !
2950 2018-12-09 18:24:54 I have an idea. Why dont you seize the means  of US oil production. This will be more then enough funding for your green deal. With the left over funds you can give that away to the poor. 
2951 2018-12-09 18:24:49 Sophie's "oil of every pearls un-insides"
2952 2018-12-09 18:24:34 Four words - they have no oil
2953 2018-12-09 18:24:04 It takes longer for a #bitcoin #litecoin transaction than an oil change. Fix that, then let's talk.
2954 2018-12-09 18:23:59 Yes that’s what I was trying to say. I feel like I have seen arguments lately that raising the gas tax is regressive & we should tax oil companies upstream. “Tax oil companies” might sound better politically but the incidence might be the same.
2955 2018-12-09 18:23:56 Also 4th kalms and dose of CBD oil
2956 2018-12-09 18:23:44 All of you who are losing their minds over this will be glad he's up if the Oil decide to run the top guys in retaliation to the last game.
2957 2018-12-09 18:23:34 Next year! The inspiration behind the collection is based on our principle to design patterns with a story! This pattern is based on oil stains.
2958 2018-12-09 18:23:26 Only in our national interest to start wars over oil 
2959 2018-12-09 18:23:23 We don’t have any refineries or sources to export our oil
2960 2018-12-09 18:23:23 Can’t Stand some of these oil field workers, NOT ALL..let’s get that straight, but I mean you’re giving girls 200$ tips trying to buy them to come home meanwhile back in Kentucky your baby and wife are hungry....smh
2961 2018-12-09 18:23:21 No, what I am saying is, that oil and gas won’t be sustainable forever. If we want to help and improve the lives of our future generations, we need to start and act now and help create renewable energy resources and start putting away these things that hurt the place we live on.
2962 2018-12-09 18:23:11 That Vegetable oil ish is so embarrassing. Can't RT that shit.
2963 2018-12-09 18:23:10 Agreed our oil companies like the wild west were born on lining their pockets as quickly as possible without thinking about tomorrow
2964 2018-12-09 18:23:10 "That you're incredibly grateful for your amazing boyfriend," and a couple of more fries get stolen. Tony just takes the box, leans back against Steve.

"Even if said boyfie smells like oil."
2965 2018-12-09 18:22:54 Saudi Arabia, United States, Russia and Kuwait, all big oil, refuse to endorse #IPCC report. Power of fossil fuels disrupts #COP24 #auspol
2966 2018-12-09 18:22:53 I'm sorry but you've bought into a lie, every single day the world uses more oil than the day before and at this point the most conservative estimate is that will continue until at least 2030 and more likely 2050. Nothing is gained by us destroying our energy sector.
2967 2018-12-09 18:22:51 I twist my hair down at night. I add water, natural oil, and gel to drop but hold the curls. 2 or 4 rows depending on the look. 
I’ll dm you a few examples.
2968 2018-12-09 18:22:49 Reserved for the wealthy/elite.... not the middle class/poor. Big oil is a prime example of this.

2971 2018-12-09 18:22:33 Uh no. The “advantage” was simply the location of the oil and gas and Conservatives blew it by not charging enough in royalties
2972 2018-12-09 18:22:32 @Walmart on Wilma Rudolph in @_ClarksvilleTN not doing oil changes?!? Reason: 5 hour wait time. Wait, what? Isn’t the word ‘express’ in there somewhere?!?Goodbye @Walmart, hello @ExpressCareSW

Insert literally any profession and you get something no one would say.
2986 2018-12-09 18:21:02 It's not rocket science but it does take political will considering that the oil patch was not on the same page. Ms. Notley possessed it.
2987 2018-12-09 18:20:47 We can't drink oil.
2988 2018-12-09 18:20:45 Has anyone ever talked about banning products with palm oil? That industry is one of the worst for pollution and the destruction of the forest to do the growing takes out a lot of natural carbon filtering.  Has there been talks with China to sell them our carbon capture tech?
2989 2018-12-09 18:20:37 a token of appreciation doesn't have value... the moment we put a price tag it's no longer appreciation but a priced good/commodity like cooking oil... for today let me not talk about GBV 
2990 2018-12-09 18:20:35 You're far better losing a 4th line guy than a D man.
While the move slows the bottom 3 guys down, it offers a forced reconsideration by the Oil, if they had plans to play dirty.
2991 2018-12-09 18:20:22 Pay phon bill & get oil changed tomorrow
2992 2018-12-09 18:19:43 my roommate: don’t get this oil in your eyes it’ll burn
me: *immediately gets it in my eyes*
2993 2018-12-09 18:19:34 We have an oil glut now. A transition won't happen over night. We won't all be in EVAs for another twenty years.
2994 2018-12-09 18:19:29 Still boggles my mind that people are duped by this snake oil salesmen.
2995 2018-12-09 18:19:22 imagine the day MBS is going to increase the price of oil by decresing the extent of selling it, how will you cut Iran's oil ?

2997 2018-12-09 18:19:19 Funny. When I was younger. All the stuff today that comes in a plastic bottle. Used to come in a glass bottle. Some stuff also came in a cardboard container. Even motor oil did at one time. One was 100% recyclable to the other also biodegradable.
2998 2018-12-09 18:19:18 Or where you’ll be buying oil, gas and energy from?
2999 2018-12-09 18:19:17 Sorry - Alberta has been supporting the rest of Canada since the oil boom. You can't just ignore that. Billions and billions and billions and billions. 

Take a look at Lib giveaways in QC (don't believe me? Follow the idiot @DiLebouthillier who does nothing but give away our $$)

3007 2018-12-09 18:18:37 Haha once we leave our oil comes 2 then little England has nothing left to trade with and your money  u lot really are deluded
3008 2018-12-09 18:18:30 Usually the money for that comes via the oil and gas industry.  Highly likely in France given that the demands of that crown include a massive upswing in gas use in order to get rid of nuclear.
3009 2018-12-09 18:18:20 why all negative ? oh yeah, big oil.
3010 2018-12-09 18:18:12 Palm Oil; Rubber; Coffee even Cocoa are still huge in the Global Market so are other Cash Crop capable of being produced. What I am saying debarring thievery Nigeria can do very well with the products listed above. Minerals and Petroleum Oil will just be icing on the Cake.
3011 2018-12-09 18:18:12 Gary, shouldn't Alberta take just a little bit of responsibility for frittering away its oil wealth, and for its refusal to impose even a small sales tax? Plus, low oil prices are hardly Ottawa's fault. Finally, personal insults are not usually the best way to win an argument
3012 2018-12-09 18:18:07 3 Have you checked Oil prices a month ago & now in India! Any idea how these prices will stay until mid 2019!! Reason!

I cud go on..Hope U understand!
Modi Ji is handling all issues very deftly. Certainly!
3013 2018-12-09 18:17:55 The lack of Pipeline capacity is a huge concern but just as concerning is all of the regulations and red tape put in place by the liberals which has literally chased investment in the oil patch out of this country. Bill C69 should it be implemented would be the death blow
3014 2018-12-09 18:17:53 True but very inconvenient to the propagandists of the oil palm industry being @orangutans , @orangulandtrust , @hmxt0 who defend the oil palm industry and the feeble industry self-regulatory greenwashing body the RSPO, whilst happily taking charity $ to ‘save orangutans’ .

3016 2018-12-09 18:17:47 You knew Peters needed a body to deal with the residual Tkachuk issues from last game.
This is about having a body who will make the Oil accountable if they go cheap.

3018 2018-12-09 18:17:39 Obama taking credit for America's oil boom is pathetic, but Democrats believing it is simply dangerous, because it indicates just how far gone & out of touch Democrat voters are.

FACT: Obama opposed Fossil Fuels.

Tried to STOP drilling.
Tried to KILL coal industry.

GET A CLUE!
3019 2018-12-09 18:17:30 Sure, but I thought the whole subject of the discussion was "do you tax 'the oil companies' (i.e. upstream) or consumers (downstream)".

3028 2018-12-09 18:16:04 @APPropst Does this mean that the demand for oil is lower or that the supply of oil is higher?
3029 2018-12-09 18:15:59 . Do you know she was not the one in charge and that the intervention was not just to overthrow Kadafi, but to secure oil fields and deals in Libya!
3030 2018-12-09 18:15:55 No,its becoming the future with plastic to oil { Diesel fuel}  Oil plants are working every day out there in this world, making fuel .We should be all working on getting these plants in our future.
3031 2018-12-09 18:15:51 Not only is there nothing to replace the $$ from oil & gas, there's nothing to replace oil & gas. Wind & solar aren't going to cut it. Nuclear is our best bet.
3032 2018-12-09 18:15:36 Considering the Flames hot streak started once they beat the Oilers, it’s fitting for the Oil to get a chance to stop it

3035 2018-12-09 18:15:25 Sunday’s fun fact:  If tomorrow you walk out and strike oil or precious minerals, the government says its theirs. But if tomorrow you walk out and find someone planted 20 pot plants on your land, the government says it’s yours.
3036 2018-12-09 18:15:25 about to play a prank on Ashton involving oil. wonder how it'll go.
3037 2018-12-09 18:15:18 1) The US is the largest oil producer in the world and just became a net oil exporter for the 1st time in 75 years. 
2) Oil Prices Jump After OPEC Agrees To Bigger-Than-Expected Production Cut. 
3) US has the biggest oil finding in Texas and New Mexico.
Looks like it's an #OilWar
3038 2018-12-09 18:15:16 I tweeted directly to Question Period. Told them having him as the opposition to oil was akin to having Joseph Goebbels on to explain how Nazi-ism isn't extreme. The man is a zealot. Even Tondra was rolling her eyes.
3039 2018-12-09 18:15:10 That awkward moment when a former international oil tycoon and Russian Order of Friendship recipient has to be the voice of moral reason for a President.

3041 2018-12-09 18:15:01 They estimate peak oil demand to be 2040. Giver or take. It’s mind boggling we as Canadians don’t take advantage of that.
3042 2018-12-09 18:14:55 Perhaps they should refuse the transfer payments so their hands are indeed clean and not involved in the oil industry

3046 2018-12-09 18:14:33 So would you say there are better, more suitable, healthy sources of fats, such as omega 3's, proteins etc?  Fish oil has been reported to be ineffective, whereas healthier sources are available such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and canola oil.
3047 2018-12-09 18:14:31 Please name the program subsidies for oil and gas... I'll wait.

Let’s use our oil keep economy going and use Canadian oil from Alberta!
3054 2018-12-09 18:13:37 Hmm I heard that was good. But you should try rose hip oil or vitamin E oil. 

I recently heard Caudalie has good serums.
3055 2018-12-09 18:13:21 I’m talking about your economy now, before the boom of oil hit Alberta was on the same level as the rest of Canada, you’re welcome
3056 2018-12-09 18:13:18 Except @JoyAnnReid
3057 2018-12-09 18:13:01 Trader Joe’s, I’m going to try bio oil and see if I see more improvements with that.
3058 2018-12-09 18:12:56 I’m still waiting for the oil industry to survive without 10’s of billions in taxpayer subsidies every year...
3059 2018-12-09 18:12:48 Somebody mentioned the price of Alberta Oil increased $10/BBL after that move, so I guess it was a terrible decision...?
3060 2018-12-09 18:12:25 I don’t buy it anymore due to all the Palm Oil in it. But I’ll admit it tastes good.
3061 2018-12-09 18:12:23 Nullify all the environmental regulations they’ve rolled back, including oil drilling, grabbing public lands, and seismic testing in oceans
3062 2018-12-09 18:12:16 I think he’s right, though I’m with the decentralization-istas in that gold won’t ever be primary again. Instead, as the theory goes, a mix of “monies” will become convertible, with potentially your thesis on gold-for-oil being one layer at a strategic level

who now commands the UFO cause he just ships oil now and 
has no wells to pump oil
3065 2018-12-09 18:11:55 Because they would rather pay more money from countries that oppress women & LGBTQ folks than buying cheaper, more ethical oil from their fellow Canadians.  

I can’t understand how folks oppose oil pipelines while receiving the benefits of billions of dollars of oil money?
3066 2018-12-09 18:11:22 Cheaper than vegas or CO?! 
How much is an 8th? 
Also do they sell oil/shatter/dabs there?
3067 2018-12-09 18:11:19 The UAE need to move away from oil in next 25 years, anyway, too reliant.
Why not fund those programs for the needy with renewables?
3068 2018-12-09 18:11:07 Between protective styles & wild hair growth oil .... my natural hair has flourished tremendously over this last year.
3069 2018-12-09 18:11:05 This POS doesnt care about the next generation. Instead of being the forfront of technology where America can lead, we are being nostalgic about a dying industry. Why not cut the subsidies for big oil?
3070 2018-12-09 18:11:03 Of course the oil free Nikola Tesla UFO is sending Saudi Arabia

3071 2018-12-09 18:10:38 in my mind the only “essential oil” is olive oil

3073 2018-12-09 18:10:24 No actually it wasn’t but keep telling yourself that. Alberta’s oil game was built on the backs of us easterners you’re saying fuck you too, there is a reason they call Fort Mac Nfld’s capital city

3080 2018-12-09 18:10:07 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it

3082 2018-12-09 18:10:05 McCaffrey's so slippery he may as well be soaked in baby oil. That's gonna get annoying.
3083 2018-12-09 18:10:04 yeah this seems like the key point.  a gas tax isn't for raising revenue or punishing oil companies.  the main reason to have it is to get people to buy less gas!  if it doesn't hurt it isn't working.
3084 2018-12-09 18:10:03 @JoelEmbiid a drop of cbd oil on your upper lip, temples and back of your neck will wipe that migraine right out. You want a case sent over?

3087 2018-12-09 18:09:48 We must all work together to recognize that water dripping down on our collective heads is not rain, it pee. They are pissing on US, on Vladimir Putin's orders, in an effort to cash in on lucrative oil, nuclear power, hotel development and other deals. #WakeUpAmerica .
3088 2018-12-09 18:09:45 “    “ (disgusted silence). But then a result not entirely unexpected as Russia & Saudi Arabia’s entire economies depend on continuing to sell the world more oil. They know if we move away from that for energy they’ll eventually go broke. Need a huge lever to impose a shift on em

3091 2018-12-09 18:09:26 Well, who are "the fossil fuel companies"? Not many vertically integrated operators left (Shell, BP, and XOM?) The story of the last two decades in oil has been breaking up integrated oils into separate upstream and downstream operations linked only by trademark license (if that)

3099 2018-12-09 18:08:14 Why so snotty? You made the statement and you just can’t back it up. The price of oil sucks and the pipeline didn’t get built. That is not dismantling anything.
3100 2018-12-09 18:08:13 Why exactly does anyone want to "crater Alberta's economy"? You're living in a sad fantasy world created by Kenney, Scheer et al, a world which bears no resemblance to reality. Despite the current challenges to the oil/gas sector, Alberta is doing quite well.
3101 2018-12-09 18:08:04 We'd be importing BC fruit from a foreign country. BC is not going to be hurting - highways & railways through the US that go around AB. With the glut of oil supply in US thinking RoC would be making good deals with US producers. Saudis happy to deal too.
3102 2018-12-09 18:07:52 Who said the wealthy would be protected? Obviously their oil conpanies need to go down. And they should be taxed to help fund green infrastructure. But you also need high gas taxes.
3103 2018-12-09 18:07:44 I mean. Oil and heat ??? I always just thought I would leave the popcorn in there and it would burn. Not have the empty kettle burst into flames
3104 2018-12-09 18:07:36 Gotta make sure technical colleges are included on that list. Allowing workers to go back to school after their industries collapse (like coal and oil) would keep people out of poverty.
3105 2018-12-09 18:07:36 Let all the states be given control of their resources. The world is moving away from oil.
3106 2018-12-09 18:07:35 Yes they are,  I for one would enjoy seeing glass bottles for my beverages.  Always felt the products tasted better.  Just need the employment factor to catch up with green initiatives,  can’t phase out oil until such jobs are available for a smooth transition

3108 2018-12-09 18:07:11 Things will not be bleak.
There will be realignments and adjustments.
If the price of oil falls , then another recession.
But things will not be bleak.

And people who were skeptical of it then were called the sane thing they're called now: denialists, idiots, rubes, Big Oil shills, etc, etc. People really don't like their theories questioned.

3116 2018-12-09 18:06:21 I need y’all to stop using clay masks every second of the day. They’re great for absorbing sebum & drying out pustules — but overusing them can dry you out, causing MORE oil.

3121 2018-12-09 18:06:01 Nope, this investigation confiscated way more than that. His golf trips alone cost 3x as much. Where is your outrage there? He's a snake oil salesmen and you just keep buying.

3123 2018-12-09 18:05:42 Fortunately for @QunolOfficial and other snake oil manufacturers there is a sucker born every minute.
3124 2018-12-09 18:05:39 @NHLFlames I'm thinking the #Flames1stGoal will be scored by @TKACHUKycheese_ . I would love to see him get the Oil all upset early.
#Flames #oilsuck
3125 2018-12-09 18:05:39 Have the SNP apologised for lying about the oil money in the 2014 referendum. Or, have they apologised for wasting tax payer money on foreign aid that isn't needed, or for going to court to hide their lies about legal advice?
3126 2018-12-09 18:05:34 But by the same token, such taxes wouldn't have much effect on the downstream demand, which is the positive effect of a consumption tax. We *want* oil to be more expensive so that downstream consumers are incented to switch to lower-carbon energy sources.
3127 2018-12-09 18:05:32 1-0 up and we were dominating the game. that's the best you can come up with . winning a game with 10 men. 4-3, 3-0, 1-2 . haven't even beaten us at Anfield since 2003 . Everton havent since 1999 . same size but one has the oil money.
3128 2018-12-09 18:05:30 Yes Alex but this is slightly more believable because unlike Namibia and Mongolia the Congo does actually have oil.
3129 2018-12-09 18:05:26 NO MORE OIL PIPELINES! INDUSTRY GREEN
UP!!
3130 2018-12-09 18:05:26 Noooooooo. It’s crazy because when skin is dry all the oil gets trapped underneath which causes acne and sadness. Jojoba oil is super close to the skins natural oils and helps your skin to stop overproducing oil!
3131 2018-12-09 18:05:21 Several years back, we had total snowfall of 71 inches between December and March. Barns collapsed. Roads looked like canyons. We had to hire a backhoe to clear our driveway so the oil truck could make a delivery.
3132 2018-12-09 18:05:21 I drink water & use lotion & oil. My mom said she didn’t get any but i did my last 3 weeks 
3133 2018-12-09 18:05:13 I don't think so. Regardless, what percentage needs to be replaced before it starts impacting oil prices?
3134 2018-12-09 18:05:07 And who else pays him? Big oil, pharmacy, defense contractors, anti-choice lobby?
3135 2018-12-09 18:04:56 I wonder if you cut out oil and gas from your life how that would go. Good luck with that 
3136 2018-12-09 18:04:54 Snake oil and it’s “to” not “too”.
3137 2018-12-09 18:04:44 You should do a video on how big oil and car companies are down playing this information.
3138 2018-12-09 18:04:35 To my brothers - that olive oil/castor oil mix works wonders under a silky - we keeping hairlines till 2060
3139 2018-12-09 18:04:19 I’ve done vitamin e oil, brown sugar and tooth brush but I’ll give that a try
3140 2018-12-09 18:04:16 Happy to help! I get a big pan, put the artichokes in and add some salt and lemon juice. Boil for 25-35 mins until the leaves can be pul of easily. Mix olive oil, balsamic and garlic and dip the soft end of the leaves into it. Delicious!
3141 2018-12-09 18:04:07 Personally, I think the problem started back in '93 when the first NAFTA was born. Canada was guaranteed shipment of oil to the US market. It was also unfortunately 75% mandatory. Now we are looking for other markets and find our pipelines only feed directly into Trump's pocket.
3142 2018-12-09 18:04:06 B/c back in the day they had lots of oil & we needed it. Like a drug addict we'll support anyone who gives us something we need so badly.
3143 2018-12-09 18:04:06 keune is really good i also suggest to  use aussie hair oil
3144 2018-12-09 18:03:54 If Alberta moves to separate, Canada will have to pay dearly to get  air, rail or truck transport across our borders. Also Canada will not be able to produce enough oil & gas for its own needs. That's something for Justin to ponder while he straightens his socks.
3145 2018-12-09 18:03:51 Chug a bottle of oregano oil it’s intense but it’s effective
3146 2018-12-09 18:03:44 Tar sands oil is the worst.
3147 2018-12-09 18:03:44 Hamas are backed by Iran and Iran is oil either you folks should be okay with high oil prices otherwise some diplomacy has to be played. You can not win it all on your terms. It's much more complicated than simply this or that
3148 2018-12-09 18:03:36 CBD Oil Ocean Zone
3149 2018-12-09 18:03:34 Nope.

You get that no one believes a single stat from you Oil zealots, right ?

We believe StatsCan.  Not some Koch Brothers financed propaganda.

It's 3.5 % of GDP .

And the fastest growing ( and responsible for more jobs created last year. ) is Green Energy.
3150 2018-12-09 18:03:31 @amazon I was searching for a specific essential oil for the 1st time in your app & received a text from a vendor saying I qualified for a discount on essential oil based on my purchase history. I did not put anything in my Amazon cart so I’m curious how this person got my info??
3151 2018-12-09 18:03:24 Not really. 

But I'm not asking anyone to do the impossible. We need both: better public transport, and ways to make people use it instead of comfortable private cars running on cheap oil. They both need to progress together and, yes, it will hurt. But it needs to be done.
3152 2018-12-09 18:03:22 People who say no to pipeline should start walking everywhere get rid of their heating,anything w/petroleum in it!
I’m  all about the environment but our country needs this pipeline.  I do not know how to make it safer nor am I political. But our lives depend on oil. Make it 
3153 2018-12-09 18:03:21 Just started using argan oil on the last 3-4inches of my hair. Taming the hay frizz quite nicely.
3154 2018-12-09 18:03:16 Thanks, pal! & I gotchu. I'll tell her you wanna slather her in baby oil & feed her chitlin sandwiches LMAO.
3155 2018-12-09 18:03:09 Can't sleep? Use lavender essential oil in your bath. You will sleep like a baby.
3156 2018-12-09 18:03:07 Why don’t I do oil painting??
3157 2018-12-09 18:03:03 I hate getting oil changes, my shit always end up being around 60
3158 2018-12-09 18:02:50 I have this often. Magnesium oil sprayed on and rubbed in does help...
3159 2018-12-09 18:02:39 Seems getting a paid gig at NATO/ Qatar/ weapon manufacturers/banks and oil firms funded MEI requires zero knowledge or qualifications still.
3160 2018-12-09 18:02:36 Not to mention Trump incorrectly thanked Saudi Arabia for those low prices, when really Canada supplies us with 60% of our oil needs.
3161 2018-12-09 18:02:35 I dey tear some Oil Rice with some dope chicken stew den some sardine, you dey hung like me ah link op

3169 2018-12-09 18:01:38 Must just be more paid for misinformation from the oil industry.
3170 2018-12-09 18:01:36 Of course the elite donors of the Dem Party are knocking on Beto’s door! They know that he will be for Wall St, big banks,oil and gas, etc. The people? They’ll get thrown aside as they have for years!
3171 2018-12-09 18:01:35 Would you prefer that America is beholden to other countries' oil production? Are you going to magically make America not need oil?
3172 2018-12-09 18:01:35 But what is a "government program" other than something that benefits the country overall. From the military to middle east oil wars to the CDC. Society, "We the people..." is all about collective action for the common good.
3173 2018-12-09 18:01:15 BETTER ANGELS However, given Scotland’s status to Westminster as a parking lot for nuclear weapons and a source of billions of pounds in oil revenue, don’t expect it to let Scotland go easily. 
3174 2018-12-09 18:01:14 Then stop accepting that Alberta oil flo bro....
3175 2018-12-09 18:01:08 The IEA predicts global oil use to increase until st least 2040. I completely support efforts to transition to a post oil world but am very supportive of ethically produced Canadian oil. 
Blocking Canadian pipelines does NOTHING to benefit the world
3176 2018-12-09 18:01:01 I’m not sure how you can say either of those parties dismantled the oil industry.
3177 2018-12-09 18:00:47 Hypocrite. you're okay with using oil and gas because it enriches your life on a daily basis, but you're against the workers and the industry for whatever fucking stupid reason. Like I said you don't have an opinion that's worth listening to.

3180 2018-12-09 18:00:18 @McDonalds changed the oil they fry things with and they need to go back. 
3181 2018-12-09 18:00:15 If we have become a net exporter of oil why are U.S. gasoline at retail gas stations not falling in price ? Why are we not paying less than anyone on the planet for our gas at the pumps ?
3182 2018-12-09 18:00:06 just like hand washing it in the sink but instead of washing powder you use the coconut oil. After that you can start stretching it. you might need to repeat the process, if the sweater's still too small.
3183 2018-12-09 17:59:25 For now it is, but the tmx is going to china to be refined and used. That is why we depend on foreign oil like you said. This isnt about energy independence, its about massive oil companies getting more money for their share holders. Has nothing to do with helping CDNS and jobs.
3184 2018-12-09 17:59:21 Yeah but i don't think he's mad he's just mixing water and oil
3185 2018-12-09 17:59:17 I sorta see your point but the idea of trust-busting is not that you make an oil/tobacco/data company’s core product less dangerous, but that you reduce their individual corporate power. An FB feed not fuelled by subsidiary data is a less powerful FB. Same for all the FAANGs.
3186 2018-12-09 17:59:15 Ah. Pics please? I HOPE she washed the oil out of her hair!
3187 2018-12-09 17:59:07 @exploreVenango haha no article on franklin oil city because the Derrick/news-herald doesn’t have a Sunday paper.  Their “writers” can’t read the Derrick article and paraphrase it for their website.

3195 2018-12-09 17:58:34 They are busy recruiting agents in INGO’s for placement in countries with vested interest. What good is Palestine, no oil, no Cold War neighbours.
3196 2018-12-09 17:58:33 galaxy brain take: we should keep consuming oil because moving to renewables would decimate poorer economies in the Middle East and South America.
3197 2018-12-09 17:58:17 we are the most wasteful country on the planet. those countries that sell oil do so because of our wasteful usage. we have to pay for our waste created by the industries that sell us products, including oil.  we have to cut back.  WE CAN NOT TAX ONLY THE RICH OUT OF THIS PROBLEM
3198 2018-12-09 17:58:16 You are incapable of comprehending anything, aren't you?
Nobody said "end oil now'... We said you need to stop looking to it as your savior and get with a world that's moving beyond it.

Your bias negates your ability to discuss this in any objective manner.

3203 2018-12-09 17:58:05 The LA Times advocates pouring millions of illegal migrants into Southern California while also restricting water, housing and energy. LA will be destroyed by progressives long before the rest of the World is destroyed by oil.
3204 2018-12-09 17:58:00 did someone spill some oil
3205 2018-12-09 17:57:53 I don't agree with poverty as the reason. In D's Nigeria dat we live in a man or woman can park their car and join people to scoop the oil.
3206 2018-12-09 17:57:50 Atleast in 9ja some dey scoop vegetable oil. She sabi pack glass cup.
3207 2018-12-09 17:57:49 Protest against the horrible bastards They are doing this in 2018 in your name.

Time better spent than going on about what a Barca player did years ago
3208 2018-12-09 17:57:40 They will use that gutter vegetable oil to fry akara and dundu for Lagosian going to work tomorrow.

3210 2018-12-09 17:57:26 I had a 2001 Subaru Outback. I loved it. Went to replace it and couldn’t deal with the current interior. Too toy like.

3217 2018-12-09 17:57:03 1/2 Just wondering, a cooking oil brand was banned for showing ads during NAVRATRI as it showed some non veg items.Considering MH has banned Pan masala, gutka, etc things, still our channels in MH show their ads.
3218 2018-12-09 17:56:45 At what point do you start looking at retraining workers displaced by oil conditions? In the short term, there will be another pipeline; in the longer term, there is big structural displacement. Do you face the music now or later?
3219 2018-12-09 17:56:43 Donald Trump didn't do anything to increase Shale oil. He is a zero effect president.
3220 2018-12-09 17:56:24 Kudos to boss @NnimmoB & other leading voices in Nigeria's Environment space.

Meanwhile, while we await the adoption of the report next year or soonest, we need up our game in holding oil coys in Nigeria more accountable to existing envir laws.
3221 2018-12-09 17:56:23 Superpowers export high-margin monopoly goods & services and import narrow-margin commoditized goods. In other words, the US becoming an oil exporter is not a meaningful path to wealth.

3229 2018-12-09 17:55:19 You know the best way to do that?  Make sure the oil companies stay alive so they can afford to clean it up.  You want abandoned well sites and incomplete reclamation.  Kill the industry like the last Trudeau, looks like we're on that road anyway.

3233 2018-12-09 17:54:52 Imagine this. You just picked up a ~b e a u t i f u l~ focaccia that's crusted with salt and just ^smells^ like olive oil. You're gonna dip that ish in more olive oil. You're turning on that thing you've been dying to watch and turning off your notifications. This is self love.
3234 2018-12-09 17:54:50 Guys i believe Trump must get another term. He started a trade war and nearly choked his economy but he won it. He even made oil prices fall from $100 to about $50 in less than a month. What more leadership do you want? Hell, i would even push for a third term.
3235 2018-12-09 17:54:50 No one's say we haven't spent money. A bloody lot of it. I'm just making the point that as old & as established a club as they are City, there level of success was very sparse prior to the oil rich Arabs arrived in town.
3236 2018-12-09 17:54:47 Son, you know how much they had to pay just for Beyoncé to perform at their wedding?? Jesus Christ. I need to marry a Prince. Or an oil tycoon.
3237 2018-12-09 17:54:43 Canadian oil companies need to start advertising with easy to understand metrics. Death/barrel of oil would be a good start.
3238 2018-12-09 17:54:39 Good luck. People love oil, and that love is what drives demand and drives the market. Convincing the human race that oil is an abusive spouse that we need to divorce won't be easy.
3239 2018-12-09 17:54:38 So the usa russia and saudi arabia blocked the climate change agreement, i wonder why?

3240 2018-12-09 17:54:29 We attracted the best because of low taxes, the original Alberta Advantage. QC and NS also have oil and gas deposits, how that working out for them?
3241 2018-12-09 17:54:20 And also, I studied a MSc in Sustainable Bioenergy 6 years ago because I truly believed this narrative of CO2 driven global warming, so much so that now my expertiese is biodiesel production from waste cooking oil.
Yet, so far I  found very little compelling evidence... (1/2)

Thank the drug gods for this amazing blessing.

3260 2018-12-09 17:52:03 This same kind of talk was going around over smog and leaded gasoline. Back in the day the older generation and some big oil science said no harm in lead and smog. Here we are again.....

3263 2018-12-09 17:51:40 PEOPLE! One of the policy positions he ran on was energy independence, which is a national security issue. If we have to buy oil from Saudi Arabia we have to deal with their shit. So he increased domestic oil production AND renewable energy. See the bigger picture
3264 2018-12-09 17:51:38 Update: I can’t be a lipstick because who’s going to get the oil changed? :/
3265 2018-12-09 17:51:36 Is it okay to use oil cleanser as my daily face wash
3266 2018-12-09 17:51:33 Yall use wild growth oil?!

3270 2018-12-09 17:51:00 You clearly don’t understand how devolution works. Money from whisky, oil and most taxes go to WM. Cos of austerity they send back less and less. We have high levels of deprivation due to years of L/T governments. SNP or any other Scot Gov working with a smaller and smaller pot.
3271 2018-12-09 17:50:51 You have no idea. ASDA is like 1/8th Wal-Mart. Where else can you buy all your groceries, a new wardrobe, bike, get your cars oil changed, visit the optician, have a Nathan's original hotdog, and stock up on all the gun supplies you need. *sigh* homesick haha

3275 2018-12-09 17:50:35 corporations emit emissions because they are profit-seeking, so if we replace oil companies with worker-owned oil coops they will leave all the oil in the ground for some reason?
3276 2018-12-09 17:50:34 It’s actually real simple. It’s about the voting records. Are you into fracking, oil pipes lines, big bank bailouts, unjust wars, give spying on citizens, for-profit healthcare, school as a debt instrument, low wages, and meaningless climate action? If so HRC is your candidate.
3277 2018-12-09 17:50:34 When fuel prices were higher in 2011-15, US fuel consumption plateaued & sales of big vehicles plummeted. But all the rents went to oil companies. We can go back to USD 5/gal gasoline and spend that surplus a green new deal and refunds to the poor. What's the problem?

3280 2018-12-09 17:50:26 Funny how they fill their mouth talking about @POTUS  being a dictator and here they come@, the progressive socialist liberals wanting to nationalize companies , take over industries like oil and now theatening individuals becuase she fooled ppl into giving her a position in gov

3294 2018-12-09 17:48:39 PSA: if your skin is dry stop what you’re doing and go purchase jojoba oil. Use it as a moisturizer twice a day. Thank me later.
3295 2018-12-09 17:48:39 Well you can carry on but that oil is never going to grow on trees and the less there is the more it will cost. I like the idea of just buying the machine and the fuel for it never going up because its free.

3316 2018-12-09 17:45:23 What oil you using mate?
3317 2018-12-09 17:45:22 The US strategy has to change with such low oil prices... Despite the OPEC cut, US shale and global slowdown will cap prices even if we reduce Iran exemptions.

3322 2018-12-09 17:44:30 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.

3327 2018-12-09 17:43:42 Plus what can Alberta do to help themselves?   Diversify industry? Sales tax?  Next time there is excess money from oil sales, save some?? Do not give it away.   No doubt this is bad for Alberta.  We pay sales tax in Ontario.  Have for a long time.

3335 2018-12-07 23:59:49 What a week in markets. The story has changed. OPEC pull a buzzer beater on a deal to cut oil production. NFPs disappoint -- inflation not so much the fear, now it's slower growth. Treasuries up, stocks down. The next two weeks likely to be just as volatile.
3336 2018-12-07 23:59:40 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
3337 2018-12-07 23:59:32 To say nothing of the thousands of bats and birds being killed annually by EACH of these monstrous mixmasters. An oil company kills a couple of otters and it’s the end of the world. But all of these dead flying critters? 
3338 2018-12-07 23:59:22 They were caught before they could dismantle the sanctions — that oil deal & trumps tower in moscow both required dropping the sanctions.  That was the deal.  If popadopolis had kept his mouth shut, it likely would have all happened.

3374 2018-12-07 23:56:46 So why not support the use of #wool?  It is against our code of practice to NOT shear a sheep.  It is a welfare issue to NOT shear a sheep. Wool is very sustainable whereas plastic "fibre" is not as it is made of oil products. Maybe do some research before you label things.

3380 2018-12-07 23:55:59 idk i’m just mad that my oil change was $80
3381 2018-12-07 23:55:49 Also our foreign reserve as we speak is $42 billion at the time price of oil is at $45 per barrel. Under Jonathan regime there was oil boom we could have saved enough though we did but was later looted by PDP. Which got us into a technical recession
3382 2018-12-07 23:55:41 もう連写の勢いで、
3383 2018-12-07 23:55:36 I hear your point, but comparing the munchies to people dying? There are many ways to have the medicinal effects of THC. Like you mentioned oil, there are also edibles. I'm not a huge fan of smoking it solely bec it is harmful to the respiratory system, but I'm for edibles,
3384 2018-12-07 23:55:31 Yes! Beautiful clean economy helping oil! The stuff that everything good is made of. I’m so glad you agree.
3385 2018-12-07 23:55:29 Have they announced when they intend on selling by? Any projected date for that? Also, are they selling both flower and oil?
3386 2018-12-07 23:55:27 because there s no oil in china
3387 2018-12-07 23:55:23 Great, now time to stop coal plants, pipelines and oil and gas subsidies.
3388 2018-12-07 23:55:16 Im giving them the coconut oil too
3389 2018-12-07 23:55:13 A mother fucking, dick sucking, pussy selling, pornographic movie making prostitute walks up to a brother that has been in God all his life and ask, " may I pray for you and anoint you with oil because you need Jesus to save you ? "
3390 2018-12-07 23:54:57 Like the oil in the middle East  yah right it doesn't matter..
3391 2018-12-07 23:54:37 Proud of myself. Got the in-laws house cleaned for Christmas tomorrow. Why oh why do I enjoy it lol but got caught moving tractors to Murphy oil the shelves

3395 2018-12-07 23:54:07 Yeah, as long as extraction remains cheap. A similar exercise: Multiply the amount of easily accessible oil in the world by 8, and imagine what we'd do with that. Now imagine China is the world, and you'll see the situation is similar.
3396 2018-12-07 23:54:07 She’s a threat to his big oil and big pharma financiers.
3397 2018-12-07 23:54:00 Moving oil by rail is the dumbest idea ever. Besides displacing other exports like grain, one major accident, which is bound to happen eventually, will send millions of litres of oil into the major BC rivers, killing off vast amounts of salmon and other wildlife. Need a pipeline!
3398 2018-12-07 23:53:56 Yes - you dropping f bombs.   I didn't say burn it all up.   I said transition to renewables now that we can.  Still, having a large supply of low cost oil and gas during the transition is a great thing for the U.S.
3399 2018-12-07 23:53:39 Actually I'm gonna make a batch of brownies tonight...I'm gonna use a 1/2 cup of canna coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil the recipe calls for. Should be some lights out treats for the weekend

3405 2018-12-07 23:52:59 Wow Trumpy. A little harsh but I agree Pompeo is great!!  Never understood the Oil Man pick. Keep it up.
3406 2018-12-07 23:52:54 We should never buy any foreign oil then
3407 2018-12-07 23:52:52 I have been waiting for this day for48 years ! The Middle East and OPEC , have screwed with us for too many years. Too many nights sleeping on gas lines in my father’s car at the pump . Mid East said were running out of oil and would be out and in poverty by the 90s      “FUKOPEC
3408 2018-12-07 23:52:46 Crack out the monoi oil weather 
3409 2018-12-07 23:52:45 Did you get the air filter at the oil place? Lol
3410 2018-12-07 23:52:42 Fenugreek oil massages WORK 
3411 2018-12-07 23:52:34 this oil change is taking so fucking long 
3412 2018-12-07 23:52:04 A thundershirt and some CBD oil.
3413 2018-12-07 23:52:01 I feel you with the executive dysfunction issue. It does fucking suck, as you said. People commission me for oil paintings and end up waiting months for their painting! Blaaahhhhh...
3414 2018-12-07 23:51:46 Are you going to allow those who are in the oil and gas industry get first crack at these new jobs?  Or since they tend to be in southern states ignore those folks?
3415 2018-12-07 23:51:36 As long as it has CBD oil in it.
3416 2018-12-07 23:51:35 That because of killing the pipelines, and making Albertans and oil industry suffer we “have” to buy their oil. I believe in equal rights and freedom which we are not supporting in Saudi. We are just funding the opposite of Canadian values there.
3417 2018-12-07 23:51:22 Frumpy bragged 2 yrs on his strengthening the economy. Now, as Obama's grip is lessening, we are beginning to see the true example of frump's economic growth. Stock's down 1&1/2% for the year and deeper every day. China trade war is hurting everyone. Slowing housing. Higher oil $
3418 2018-12-07 23:51:14 In honor of hanukkah  OPEC cut oil production #Hanukkah

3420 2018-12-07 23:51:09 Hmmmm apa bedanya bambwank
Olive oil itu kalo diterjemahin ya minyak zaitun:)
3421 2018-12-07 23:50:54 Why don’t oil companies buy rail cars
3422 2018-12-07 23:50:49 THE OIL WAS ALL OVER THAT PLACE!!! ESHKOBAH!!!
3423 2018-12-07 23:50:40 Many live with the delusion that knocking over Amazon will lower prices. The opposite occurred when Standard Oil and Carnigie were forced to end monopolies
3424 2018-12-07 23:50:36 クリスマスぼっちがこころにひびくぜぇ
3425 2018-12-07 23:50:22 Just so y’all know Nissan is offering $20 oil changes. So if you own a Nissan and want a cheap oil change schedule an appointment.
3426 2018-12-07 23:50:22 I don't understand what you're getting at.  It's an account run by Joe Vargas (Not Angry Joe) who is the first to open a CBD oil retail chain.  He's done this before and it's not a scam.
3427 2018-12-07 23:50:19 I have to ask how your going to create millions plural of jobs?  How many jobs will you eliminate in fossil fuel industry?  How will the countries whose biggest export is oil and gas survive?
3428 2018-12-07 23:50:14 Just found out my girl has been sneaking fish oil in my food to keep my coat shiny and healthy

3431 2018-12-07 23:50:03 There is an abundance of evidence that CBD Oil has medicinal benefits, including treatment of:
•Rheumatoid arthritis
•Heart disease
•Multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases
•Autism
•Glaucoma
•Nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite
•High blood pressure
3432 2018-12-07 23:50:01 In the case of oil it will be pretty much the same, it'll just take a little longer to burn. Coal, which is harder to export, might stay in the ground.
3433 2018-12-07 23:49:59 The irony being that a large  contributor to Venezuela's economic state was there fossil fuel exports. When oil prices dropped, they were f-ed. Energy diversity is common sense
3434 2018-12-07 23:49:51 はわわわわ
3435 2018-12-07 23:49:49 thank you google!!!! I now know how to turn off the maintenance light on my car since the oil change jerks forgot to do it once again 
3436 2018-12-07 23:49:38 Fooled again... rex suppressed climate change data by his own scientists while ceo of XOM and receiving rooskie medal of honor in cohoots with kremlin putin oligarchs and the trillion dollar oil deals.  Come on Mick!
3437 2018-12-07 23:49:34 gotta put the baby oil down first 
3438 2018-12-07 23:49:29 A pipeline is the safest and most cost effective method of moving oil from Alberta to the coast line. Where the tankers are loaded could and should be discussed. Perhaps loading them further out would even save money, and make sense long term. At that point, do we get a pipeline?
3439 2018-12-07 23:49:28 One can imagine.

*grabs coconut oil*

3442 2018-12-07 23:48:46 They are blocking a pipeline from Alberta to tidewater so we can sell our oil at world prices instead of selling only to the US at highly discounted prices. It also creates jobs in eastern Canada refineries. Quebec imports billions of dollars in Saudi Arabian oil. WHY??
3443 2018-12-07 23:48:45 Lmao was finna poor it happily and put some baby oil on the floor 
3444 2018-12-07 23:48:40 Ava poured her apple juice into my essential oil diffuser
3445 2018-12-07 23:48:30 How the hell do I allow myself to buy a Coach FANNY PACK but won’t buy a oil change? 
3446 2018-12-07 23:48:25 “46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids”... Yet the Democrats are turning their backs on it and are going Green instead.
3447 2018-12-07 23:48:25 Through words, interpretive dance, or oil paint?
3448 2018-12-07 23:48:18 As Tillerson hires the kurds to extract oil from Syria the pipeline on wheels get hammered by Russia.  Theat post of Syria and the kurds both in tanks nose to nose. ""If you put that drill in the ground, it's an act of war."
3449 2018-12-07 23:48:10 I’m aware of the ingredients that make up CBD oil. You stated that I have Vitamin E listed as my main ingredient which is a false claim.
3450 2018-12-07 23:48:08 Hey, where do you sign up to be work for that guy.  It sounds so rewarding and I'll get a great letter of recommendation.  I'm the CEO of Union Oil, by the way.  Look me up, @realDonaldTrump .

3453 2018-12-07 23:47:37 Yesterday my girl was having a tough day so I went and got her coffee and coconut oil so I could rub her back.
3454 2018-12-07 23:47:32 Thank you, it was extremely hard to witness. Especially knowing that he could’ve probably used something natural like cannabis oil and would have still been coherent into his last days. Sucks that it’s still illegal and not accessible
3455 2018-12-07 23:47:23 Don’t like the pot, but I love the oil.
3456 2018-12-07 23:47:20 But the means of stopping oil consumption i.e. changing energy technology is about developing cheap new energy technologies which China will adopt. Positive externalities exist!
3457 2018-12-07 23:47:17 You literally compared getting paid for twerking to getting paid to murder someone. Your priorities seem a little fucked. If you want to attack someone for getting paid to do "morally wrong" shit, start attacking and lobbying against corporations and oil and gas companies.
3458 2018-12-07 23:47:16 I will!!
3459 2018-12-07 23:47:05 well you could break up Walmart the same way Bell and Standard Oil were broken up, but clearly that makes no sense applied to online companies

3466 2018-12-07 23:46:23 I get that, I’d shuffle one or two out if that acquisition happens. And he’s a UFA this summer as well so if it doesn’t work out he walks via UFA. Another thing, the $2.2M he makes, $500K was a bonus paid on July 1, and in real dollars he’s owed just $1.4M if you trade today.
3467 2018-12-07 23:46:10 Check your Engine oil this morning.
3468 2018-12-07 23:46:05 The oil will be exported eventually. Question is, do we do it safe, or not. Driving millions of railcars down the CP and CN rail lines is not safe. Eventually there will be a disaster, and millions of barrels will end up in the Fraser and Tompson, and kill off the Salmon.
3469 2018-12-07 23:45:56 What about the low unemployment rate, the creation of jobs in the oil patch and the growth of the economies of several provinces - including Alberta's

We'll see Asian, US and S American pollution for centuries. Haha.

3476 2018-12-07 23:45:12 In the Eighties Texas was in a recession because the price of oil tanked and Bob Bullock asked me to create an economic data center to give businesses the info they needed to survive. I spent too much time on the tech and not enough finding out what businesses needed to know.

Lmfao ya'll wild.
3479 2018-12-07 23:44:50 Yet only two years ago you called Tillerson an “embodiment of the American  Dream” and cited the oil executive’s “tenacity, broad experience and  deep understanding of geopolitics.”  How time flies . . . .

3486 2018-12-07 23:44:22 And we wants to end the politicians privileges... When he says "we're stopping the taxes for oil this year", he's really saying "next year it'll come back and bigger to pay for the loss"... It happened to us before. We're not dupe this time.
3487 2018-12-07 23:44:21 Is that oil going to stay in the country?

3490 2018-12-07 23:43:48 If you are just looking for a reason to shut down any Alberta Oil exports, and then just throw doom-and-gloom scenarios out there to try to scare people, then there is no point in discussing this.
3491 2018-12-07 23:43:21 also the negative externality should be payed by extractors, not consumers, as they are renters (being born with your ass on oil deposits isn't merit) not a competitive market, so we are not in a model where it doesn't matter who you tax.

3496 2018-12-07 23:43:01 Scouting is about ethics. 

Rex Tillerson was CEO of a company that has a key role in facilitating human-caused degradation of our planet. 
Tillerson directed the enrichment of brutal dictators around the world to secure oil deals. 

Eagle Scout not so much.

3506 2018-12-07 23:41:32 No oil, no oil money. No more transfer payments, and stop asking for economic help all the time and try standing on your own two feet. Fucking deadbeat province! As an aside is Quebec an old French word for bailout or deadbeat? Asking for a friend!
3507 2018-12-07 23:41:24 Assuming for a second that you actually want to find the safest way to bring oil to tidal water, it would be far better to extend the pipeline a bit more and load tankers in either Deltaport, the coal terminal, or somewhere close.
3508 2018-12-07 23:41:09 If that were true, why did he hire him?

3526 2018-12-07 23:39:31 I’m not sure you are correct that oil companies are muddying the research. Do you have facts? There are some Shell just to name one, that are investing in green tech. If your right then other big emitters Ie: the auto industry would be trying to do the same as oil.

3529 2018-12-07 23:39:15 It's not just the transport of oil that we are worried about, although it's worth saying that every single pipeline leaks, it's the consumption we would like to curb. Stop subsidizing oil and support viable green energies. #CommonSense
3530 2018-12-07 23:39:08 i had a little bump on my cartilage and put warm sea salt with tea tree oil, is that diluting it? 
3531 2018-12-07 23:39:07 Oil change & pedicure first thing in the morning!
3532 2018-12-07 23:39:06 I have zero love for anyone in the oil industry...but what Dump is doing to a decent man who is now a private citizen is utterly reprehensible.
3533 2018-12-07 23:39:06 #fact It is possible to dislike Trump, but like his policy ideas, low unemployment, better economy, being an oil exporter, handling Syria
3534 2018-12-07 23:39:00 Don’t give them oil money.
3535 2018-12-07 23:38:54 careful... you're close to arguing with an idiot... just mock her :-p
3536 2018-12-07 23:38:52 @KailLowry  vitamin E is the main ingredient in cbd oil, do you understand your ingredients?
3537 2018-12-07 23:38:51 Honest working Albertans want their jobs. They don't want to live off gov't handouts. I surprised JT didn't offer to take a selfie with every laid off oil worker.

3541 2018-12-07 23:38:18 there are so many times in this tomb raider game where like, lara should have definitely died. like, “five helicopters and 50 bad guys are destroying an oil refinery with lara inside” died.
3542 2018-12-07 23:37:57 Ok... The thing is we're not out on the street only for the taxes on oil. It's a big contestation about every single taxe that we're not against paying but the money finishing everytime in the big societies and the politicians pockets. We wants it back.

3545 2018-12-07 23:37:42 Its not a Ugandan firm,its owned by some Somali's who have an oil firm here in Nrb.
3546 2018-12-07 23:37:31 You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. So you support U.S., Russian and Saudi Oil? Because without Alberta oil that's what you get. Glad you don't mind importing oil. You have no clue... Good bye
3547 2018-12-07 23:37:28 Alberta has had a long cycle. Needed help just to live in the Dust Bowl/Depression. Struck oil and then went through several boom/bust cycles. Never learned to plan for the future except for Lougheed's Heritage Fund that his conservative successors pissed away.
3548 2018-12-07 23:37:20 Just when US is producing enough oil, it’s time to attack. Question is if petrodollar policy is changed, who can keep funding this Ponzi scheme at higher interest rate environment? #PetroDollar #Shale
3549 2018-12-07 23:37:08 @forsolace You're right, that is an easy answer...adoption of renewable energies would accelerate. Wow, that was easy even for a dummy like myself. Oil and coal are subsidized by the way (and have been for decades).
3550 2018-12-07 23:37:04 It has medical health benefits! Hemp oil is healing. It can reduce inflammation  in the gut. The state's should decide for themselves.

3556 2018-12-07 23:36:29 Fffffffffuuuuuuuuudge, I need a new battery and oil for my car
3557 2018-12-07 23:36:24 OH YAA DEFINITLY AN ATTEMPT TO GO STRICKLY RENEWABLE GET RID OF OIL CO LIKE THATS GONNA HAPPEN THEY SMOKE. MARYJANE TOO MUCH!
3558 2018-12-07 23:36:11 OIL MONEY bro! It was a transaction. Everything with Trump is a transaction to get him more of what he thinks will fill that empty hole where his soul should be ie money.
3559 2018-12-07 23:36:01 Then why did you pick Tillerson. Putin, oil and money,perhaps?

3561 2018-12-07 23:35:52 So I haven’t used tumblr in years but I was curious to see if my posts had been deleted. Cos I at least have oil paintings I did at art school up with nude ladies. And nope ! They’re all still up :) even with their “female presenting nipples” :)
3562 2018-12-07 23:35:42 Don;t forget the Beard Oil before you head to Happy Hour 
3563 2018-12-07 23:35:35 oops!  guess that did not work out.  stock market tanking, oil prices will be headed up, deficit soaring and inflation on the way.  the only good thing is my kids won't have to deal with it because the earth will collapse because of your environmental policies. #maga
3564 2018-12-07 23:35:34 Whole Foods ...you stupid, stupid people!  You won’t take oil from Alberta, but you will from middle eastern countries that would kill you and all your employees for who you are and what you believe or don’t believe...that is crazy!  #boycottwholefoods #loveoilsands

Thats just my 2cents - Ive been on both sides, i.e. supplement sales
3569 2018-12-07 23:34:43 Last night- the end of a rye loaf and a teaspoon of olive oil. Salt
3570 2018-12-07 23:34:41 The largest American oil companies depend on their refineries in SA. When we get rid of campaign financing and lobbying maybe we stand a chance of making decisions based on right and wrong. So it will never happen.
3571 2018-12-07 23:34:34 We need to stockpile them haha. I’ve just liked Rutta the past two seasons.
3572 2018-12-07 23:34:32 Just got called back out, got to love this oil field shit. Bout to freeze my nuts off tonight 
3573 2018-12-07 23:34:25 @Trevornoah please roast Buhari very well. Fry him until the oil turns black
3574 2018-12-07 23:33:38 I'm not even sure how many pronouns there are, but there are a lot of them now. People believe they are animals and inanimate objects  and I'm expected to remember this and go along with the farce? I think not.
3575 2018-12-07 23:33:35 Could this reflect Trucking/Train shipment increases ahead of the holidays. Cold temps driving heating oil demand?
3576 2018-12-07 23:33:19 I am as expecting Joe with an olive oil bottle in there. Maybe some day.
3577 2018-12-07 23:33:16 @danjlevy I had a dream that #SchittsCreek ended with the Roses finding oil under the town, building a new mansion there, remodeling the motel (a lot) and overall revitalizing the area.

3580 2018-12-07 23:33:08 Nah your beard oil didn’t do shit
3581 2018-12-07 23:32:52 Great, then say no to equalization payments from oil producing provinces. I’m sure you must hate that you’re not being socially acceptable by taking that “oil” money. #CDNpoli #Cdnmedia
3582 2018-12-07 23:32:52 With China`s activities on the upper Mekong coupled with unseasonal dry periods, Laos cannot guarantee electricity supply. Without coal, oil and inadequate natural energy sources, it`s only a matter of time before a SEAsian nation goes nuclear.

3585 2018-12-07 23:32:33 There is also Kuwait, Indonesia, Morocco, Jordan, which are peaceful Muslim countries. The ones with the most strife and disgruntled young men are those who suffer from the ‘war on terror’, aka the war for oil, world domination and the supremacy of the petrodollar.
3586 2018-12-07 23:32:29 Uh, he’s a lazy multi millionaire?  He ran one of the most successful American oil companies, that drip government red tape and is tied up with government bureaucracy you need to fix.  Why did you impulsively hire him?  Doesn’t Make You Look Smart!!
3587 2018-12-07 23:32:11 So @realDonaldTrump says that #Tillerson is "dumb as a rock." Texas is about oil, and #Tillerson is one of the smartest oil men in recent memory. So basically, @realDonaldTrump thinks that #Texans are "dumb as rocks."
3588 2018-12-07 23:32:10 If oil truly was socially unacceptable:
1. Hydro-Quebec would have built a large network of electric car charging stations
2. Every city the size of Longueuil or bigger would have electrified light rail built by SNC-Lavalin and Bombardier
3. The REM would have been built long ago
3589 2018-12-07 23:31:57 Yes because paying people and giving women rights in the oil industry is unethical according to you, is that right? Or we could just buy Saudi oil where they beat little girls if they won’t marry. Or they cannot leave their houses unless a man is with them.
3590 2018-12-07 23:31:43 Not to mention I have to get a oil change tomorrow
3591 2018-12-07 23:31:37 It is the issue at hand when she’s one of the loudest people saying we should tax the hell out of companies using oil and coal to force everyone to use “green energy”.  That’s an insane policy she’s pushing and ignores the devastating effects it will have on the poor.
3592 2018-12-07 23:31:30 Send troops to the US to conquer the US. That’s our oil!

3594 2018-12-07 23:31:23 My hairstylist has me using Loma nourishing oil, and Nuema smoothing cream! Both can be ordered from amazon!
3595 2018-12-07 23:31:21 I read that geranium rose oil was the most effective tic repellent and got a little bottle of it, but I can't tell if it made much difference.
3596 2018-12-07 23:31:18 Oils are highly processed foods and that includes olive oil. It's not a natural thing to get out out of a olive is it? Oil is not a whole food.
3597 2018-12-07 23:31:11 I'm sure *45's appointment of Rex had nothing to do with Exxon, Rosneft or Russian oil rights and sanctions and stuff.

3614 2018-12-07 23:29:32 I agree Harper did mess up. But now Trudeau had the chance to resubmit the application for the pipelines (the judge said could be processed quickly) yet he refuses to. He wants to start selling oil overseas but he won’t build the pipeline for it #TrudeauMustGo
3615 2018-12-07 23:29:32 Should he wave his magic wand and make CDN oil prices go up?
3616 2018-12-07 23:29:30 In honor of hanukkah  OPEC cut oil production
3617 2018-12-07 23:29:27 BUT it is perfectly legal to ship Olive Oil.............. just saying.....
3618 2018-12-07 23:29:03 Less oil he uses equals more they can export. Sort of makes sense.
3619 2018-12-07 23:28:57 The cast tracks have oil bath bearings too. We did lose a bogey last year when a bearing went out that really messed up the track.

3627 2018-12-07 23:28:00 It's very sad when places of employment still discriminate natural hair. Apparently a big, picked-out afro is a "mess and not right" and curly, unpicked afros/long curls is "healthy and vibrant". 

I was made to soak my hair up to make it curly again and use my boss's oil spray.

3632 2018-12-07 23:27:29 So you do want me to spoon feed you.  Damn your lazy and dense. What the hell do you think will happen to energy costs if you tax them so much to discourage the use of oil and coal?  Come on, it’s an easy answer that even you can figure it out on your own.
3633 2018-12-07 23:27:19 Nigeria’s Oil is becoming less and less reliable as our only source of foreign exchange as OPEC has agreed to reduce the production of oil by 1.2 million barrels per day. What’s the plan for the economy? @atiku @MBuhari @YeleSowore @feladurotoye
3634 2018-12-07 23:27:10 Normal people will only take it so long. We are getting shafted from every angle. The price of oil is under 50 dollars a barrel yet the price of petroleum goes up. Taxing people more for something that will enable them to earn a wage in order to pay tax. Baffling.
3635 2018-12-07 23:27:07 Change my oil date
3636 2018-12-07 23:27:03 Yesh nilagyan ko pati olive oil at konting butter. Yan lang kasi kinain ko at half tuna sandwich hehehe

3638 2018-12-07 23:26:53 Horribly! Then my skin would break out badly even. I was 24 when I started using a safety razor. I’ve tried shaving cream and a brush but oil has always worked the best. If it has a little menthol in it, your face will feel great!
3639 2018-12-07 23:26:42 If you don’t like oil, then take a firm stand against it and refuse any money derived from it. Refusing transfer payments would be a great start.

3645 2018-12-07 23:26:21 Don't think it is Personality Disorders. It is learned social attitude, after sudden richness w oil boom, wild spending & indulging & then feeling entitled, resenting others. And with it all, no interest in Facts or education, just riches & indulgence.
3646 2018-12-07 23:26:10 Macron’s approval rating dropped to 20%. 

This is what happens when you try to do a carbon tax. Why can’t we talk about ending gas and oil subsidies? Wouldn’t that be an even more effective way to raise money?

3650 2018-12-07 23:25:20 That’s $137.80 a year if you fill up once a week and your tank is 50 litres. The decrease in production buy opec will hurt us more. At least till April 2019. Time to start moving away from gas. Hard times ahead. Oil needs real competitors for sustainably.
3651 2018-12-07 23:25:15 That defines Cory Gardner and his pseudo-Christian moral outlook to a tee! Evangelicals all over Colorado are so proud of the senator who would have crucified Christ gladly if he could get a break on the oil!

3661 2018-12-07 23:24:20 Listen, make fun all you want but they pulled a fucking coup and got an @alamodrafthouse and so now we go to Woodbury once a month. (Also there is a great olive oil store at the outlet mall ADH is next to)
3662 2018-12-07 23:24:18 I have some of the flaxseed and black castor oil!
3663 2018-12-07 23:24:11 My skin is hot trash atm let me give this rosehip oil a try 
3664 2018-12-07 23:24:10 When do we actually get on with dealing with our CO2 wast? When CA oil was flowing billions into corporate pockets we were told too expensive gotta beat the yanks-now it’s no CO2 tax cause we can’t afford it or cant install extractor tech 4 same $ reason :Meantime problem grows
3665 2018-12-07 23:24:05 We all sat there with our mouths open on the day he was announced.  Exxon Mobil? Great. He knows about oil. And that is ALL that he knew. Pompeo was a natural fit for the job.
3666 2018-12-07 23:24:02 You are strawmanning. The oil thing isn’t even climate scientists so wtf, and the ice age thing wasn’t actually supported by a majority of client scientists at the time. A minority believed it and the media ran it as a big (and inaccurate) headline. So please get your facts right
3667 2018-12-07 23:23:56 The first time I heard my lefty coworkers say “I wish we had Bush back over Trump! He wasn’t that bad!” I knew I couldn’t take anyone who claims they’re a “resister” seriously. Did they forget the hourly circle jerk in the media of “Bush lied; people died” and “no blood for oil”?
3668 2018-12-07 23:23:45 How many are part time jobs only? How many are at minimum wage? How many are short term or casual? It’s easy to pad employment stats to hide the true employment picture in Canada.  Look at Oshawa.  Look at NS call centre.  Look at oil patch.
3669 2018-12-07 23:23:37 @DGodfatherMoody Laughing your description of cars of old. My first car was a 64 dodge 3 on the tree. No power steering or breaks. Dad said if I could drive that I could drive anything. He also made me change the oil & tire before I got my license. Good Times!
3670 2018-12-07 23:23:30 @McDonalds are your fries fried in vegetable oil? Every time I post them I get at least 2 people telling me they are not
3671 2018-12-07 23:23:22 they use 'energy sector' as a whitewashing of 'oil and gas industry'. straight from Koch Bros playbook I'm sure...
3672 2018-12-07 23:23:18 We know, always knew. But Tillerson knew from the jump too. Why do all these corrupt traitors think the rest of us are stupid? Oil man's plan didnt go his way in Russia so now he says something? 
3673 2018-12-07 23:23:14 I’ve been using a safety razor for about three years and I’ve never cut myself nor had razor burn. Try using a shaving oil too.
3674 2018-12-07 23:23:06 Of course Sebastian's mind goes straight to peach scented oil, but perhaps it was time to move away from that and connect something else to sex. He laughs as he opens that drawer. 
"Fuckin' hell, Tony - do you have a side business I'm not aware of?" He calls out in the general —
3675 2018-12-07 23:23:04 i been riding around wit absolutely no oil in a damn foreign car  i gotta do better
3676 2018-12-07 23:22:52 How about jobs out west? Are you guys that tone deaf? Bringing in oil from the Saudis, Venezuela and other pillars of human rights and democracy and starving your own people. Why are you bring oil from them and not buying it from us? Why?
3677 2018-12-07 23:22:45 Too bad for the oil spot!
3678 2018-12-07 23:22:45 The top man at Shell oil said the same along the lines of another Amazon rainforest, is needed instead of eliminating fossil fuels. Of course he never actually said his company would fund such a large project as I guess their money is currently tied up in destroying life on Earth
3679 2018-12-07 23:22:42 put it in a pan with oil n see where it goes . just don't burn thr house down
3680 2018-12-07 23:22:42 How was it? I’ve tasted rancid oil before, never again... after 3 times...
3681 2018-12-07 23:22:41 Using tea tree oil on my skin used to help me so much & it smells so good
3682 2018-12-07 23:22:37 Bless you. The wrinkle from where the oil based thermometer smashed on the carpet is in the pic too.
Worlds worst photographer, that’s me!
3683 2018-12-07 23:22:36 Galalis mi dire nila mama kay gikasaban nako sila. NGANO BUTANGAN MAN JUD UG OLIVE OIL ANG INFUSED WATER????? ang cholesterol 
3684 2018-12-07 23:22:32 He's a hypocrite on basically every issue. He's a politician. He's been running around telling people America will save two trillion dollars on healthcare based on a study where the author said he got the number from Bernie himself. He's a snake oil salesmen just like the rest.
3685 2018-12-07 23:22:23 Agreed but it all stems from population growth and economies which are based on growth.  Stop and reverse those 2 things and we might have a chance. If you want to cut oil start walking and not flying to places for holidays etc.
3686 2018-12-07 23:22:22 I got an oil change, an air filter, my nails done, some tostilocos, and 3 dollars in my bank account. Life is good.
3687 2018-12-07 23:22:21 and I think under 3% oil sands. marginal. a rounding error... 

put subsidies currently going to oil and gas into renewables... $3.3B/year...
3688 2018-12-07 23:22:19 just what this team needs, more bottom pairing defencemen, lol
3689 2018-12-07 23:22:14 I WILL BE IN THE COLD AND GET FROSTBITE BEFORE I PAY $90 FOR AN OIL CHANGE
3690 2018-12-07 23:22:07 おはようごさいます
3691 2018-12-07 23:21:56 Not when the Trump administration is about to roll back environmental protections and encourage new coal mining and coal plants and more oil exploration. There’s no such thing as clean coal.
3692 2018-12-07 23:21:51 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
3693 2018-12-07 23:21:43 gas & oil company guys are a blessing 
3694 2018-12-07 23:21:40 The other two guys are Lucas Oil officials...
3695 2018-12-07 23:21:38 But they want Saudi oil?? Give me a break, for fucks sake.
3696 2018-12-07 23:21:38 We have a lot of oil platforms in the gulf of mexico that could have windmills put on them.  Some no longer have oil.  The slope of the gulf is about 1 foot to the mile, so there is a lot of space in shallow water
3697 2018-12-07 23:21:34 Wow it’s almost before people started being far liberals the unemployment rate was around 4% and decreasing. Where ethical Alberta oil was going to be sold overseas. We buy $300 million of Saudi oil regularly, that’s disgusting. The human right abuses are horrific.
3698 2018-12-07 23:21:24 Cantu Oil’s label bought every single accomplishment to her name, so to be so brave....whew sympathy and payola really won today everybody
3699 2018-12-07 23:21:20 If we keep this up we'll soon be importing oil from the US.
3700 2018-12-07 23:21:16 ありがとうございまーす
3701 2018-12-07 23:21:01 Damn that sucks Maybe it’s the oil they use to cook their stuff I don’t know
3702 2018-12-07 23:20:56 Their’s no oil in Egypt
3703 2018-12-07 23:20:52 Snake oil salesman
3704 2018-12-07 23:20:48 YOU ARE FULL OF IT, YOU'VE DECIMATED THE ALBERTA OIL JOBS AND ALL THE SPIN OFF JOBS, UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE USED UP THEIR INSURANCE. FORESTRY, FISHING, RESOURCE JOBS GONE. WHAT A PUTZ.
3705 2018-12-07 23:20:34 Finally getting an oil change after it's been 2 months overdue.
3706 2018-12-07 23:20:28 Why does a country starve when a single resource drops through the floor? How were they getting by 20 years ago when oil prices were even lower?

-KOREAN WAR IS DEFINITELY NOT OVER

-Sure taxes are low while the deficit is at an all time high so its really a negative
-ISIS definitely still out and about
-LOL WHAT. Trump literally ate the saudis assholes for oil
3709 2018-12-07 23:20:17 As far as a bunch of guards guarding an oil (gas) rig in WY.  That does not happen.  Can't remember anytime oil hands accosted and killed an Indian girl.  The drugs on the res was true tho.
3710 2018-12-07 23:20:09 Cold water after the shave closes the pores and an oil of some kind is good for razor burn. I use cocoanut oil.
3711 2018-12-07 23:19:57 Steven is the most nurturing, caring bean. He’s made me a herbal tea, rubbed cream into my stretch marks, set up the oil defuser, put oil in my ears and sprayed the sleepy pillow mist. And he does this all most nights

3713 2018-12-07 23:19:44 I hate when people think just because they wear pants/jeans they don’t need to use lotion or oil. Lazy ass.
3714 2018-12-07 23:19:43 koda - loVES TO DRAW ANIMALS!!! probably that one furry artist tbh. realyl shy about showing his work,,
tokoyami - loves to draw grotesque horror themes tbh. dark colors. oil paints all the way.
shoji - will probably draw two things at once, and probably draw dark stuff too.
3715 2018-12-07 23:19:37 If you don’t know what “Hessington Oil” is then I know I just can’t be with you
3716 2018-12-07 23:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
3717 2018-12-07 23:19:23 But Texas has oil. They just pump money out of the ground. Hard to compare.
3718 2018-12-07 23:19:22 my skin is immaculate now that I've been using Jamaican black castor oil balm
3719 2018-12-07 23:19:18 Lady, don’t even try. She has more intelligence, class and heart than you could ever hope for. Doesn’t Donny’s hair need an oil change right about now? And how often do you have to wash your pillow cases? I like men who don’t commit treason. Why don’t you?

3722 2018-12-07 23:18:58 So you can oil yourself like anwamoo
3723 2018-12-07 23:18:49 An industry who's only concern was profits. Not their workers. Rip it and ship it has been their policy for decades. It wasn't a concern that we only have one customer, who's development of fracked oil, now makes them our biggest competitor.
3724 2018-12-07 23:18:40 @JohnsonHildy article in National Review “Feds Discover Largest Oil, Natural-Gas Reserve in History”
Exactly who discovered that oil? Not the Feds for sure
3725 2018-12-07 23:18:40 Cortez is a young hack. Snake oil salesman, albeit nieve as an act. Her antics is sinking tge democrats as fast as the investigation is. Lol Emploding bigly.

3728 2018-12-07 23:18:37 aoyama - would love drawing architecture things??? like old buildings and chapels? sign him the fuck up.
ojiro - probably really likes traditional art. probably uses his tail as a paint brush sometimes. one time he made the mistake of doing oil painting with his tail.
3729 2018-12-07 23:18:32 This is cool and all, but where is the oil?
3730 2018-12-07 23:18:32 Be open to  Alberta Party’s “calls for surtax on foreign-produced oil that is imported into Canada if that oil does not meet Canada’s stringent standards for environmental protection, human rights”
3731 2018-12-07 23:18:14 Y’all I just sold my oil for the first time!
3732 2018-12-07 23:18:10 #3ShotsOfTequila Cod Liver Oil is nasty 
3733 2018-12-07 23:17:55 but since you are so worried about cost, I'm sure there's some oil subsidies, or a war in South Asia, that we could end to make up for it.
3734 2018-12-07 23:17:48 I av. Something that I received with 50ltr of oil

3738 2018-12-07 23:17:24 Yeah, but he was also lazy as hell man. I heard when he was at Exxon he’d swing in at 10, make some calls and be golfing by 3 cos that’s how you climb the ladder at a bajillion dollar oil firm don’t ya know.
3739 2018-12-07 23:17:17 It’s about ppl making 1200€ a month who see their oil bill rise from 2K in 2Y, aka a pretty stupid tax plan (pro tip: ppl don’t pay what they can’t pay, only gov does)
3740 2018-12-07 23:17:07 Oil is a social benefit, tobacco isn’t. They are only connected in your mind
3741 2018-12-07 23:17:04 Why doesn't Canada put a tax on imported oil from Country's with poor environmental practices and human rights records? #abpoli #cdnpoli

3744 2018-12-07 23:16:50 I put that wild growth oil in my hair & shit been itching bad since  wtf
3745 2018-12-07 23:16:44 One of the various miracles of Hanukkah is that a tiny little bit of oil burned for eight days instead of just a few hours.
3746 2018-12-07 23:16:41 Again I have to point out that these scientists and experts have been wrong on other big subjects. 1 gonna run out of oil. 2 we are headed for another ice age. Whether you like it or not they have been wrong before. Just like doctors they are only human, not perfect.
3747 2018-12-07 23:16:41 Yep they poison oil prices too and food prices we are better off without them
3748 2018-12-07 23:16:24 @purearthasia hi. Could you tell me where I can buy your products in London (England)? I’m looking for the wild rose face cream and face oil and the mandarin body butter. Thanks!
3749 2018-12-07 23:16:22 Rex Tillerson, I am sure, voted for Hillary Clinton. He despises Trump. But here is the irony: Tillerson is an oil man, NO PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE USA HAS BEEN BETTER TO TILERSON'S INDUSTRY THAN @POTUS , Hey Rex- Hillary would have DECIMATED your industry
3750 2018-12-07 23:16:22 So let’s stop sharing oil in Canada and stop the equalization payments. Simple.  Our economy is dying quickly. Our rich in natural resources Canada is failing in growing national debt.  Talk about killing a great country.

tsuyu - watercolor all the way. HATES OIL PAINTING,,, also would probably do surrealism stuff
3758 2018-12-07 23:15:35 Which essential oil is best to get people to stop talking to you.
3759 2018-12-07 23:15:16 You do realize that oil is a finite resource right? As in, it will run out one day. Green energy is the future. It has to be.
3760 2018-12-07 23:15:10 Sure was a great generation. I have hope for the millenials in that they seem to reject corruption, greed and injustice, but that generation between Bush and millenials is garbage. They support a snake oil salesman as President. You who I'm talking about... the red MAGA hat folks
3761 2018-12-07 23:15:08 I have a bunch of the glitters but haven't played with them much. I really want to try the fairy oil.  Tea tree & chamomile are good for keeping seborrheic eczema in check.

3765 2018-12-07 23:14:58 I think they oppose the US having control over Iranian oil fields, which the US has had its sights on for 50+ years.
3766 2018-12-07 23:14:53 Said the man from a party who covered up sexual harassment in its ranks , is at the forefront of the anti Semitic BDS movement and spent the last 20 years campaigning against Alberta and the oil industry #leapmanifestomuch?
3767 2018-12-07 23:14:44 We have had 2 fail on red ones in the past. Now we change oil every 1000 hrs and inspect old oil, don’t hold much oil =cheap insurance. Haven’t had one fail in the last 10 yrs.
3768 2018-12-07 23:14:39 As expected, today’s meeting of the Organization of #Petroleum Exporting Countries #OPEC concluded with an agreement to reduce #Oil output once again to “stabilize the market” and stop the price erosion that has plagued oil markets for the past several weeks.
3769 2018-12-07 23:14:21 Oil & Gas didn't used to be a sin, but just like factory farming it's getting closer & closer to being one because it's killing the planet. We can all do better, turning off the tap is possible, have to start somewhere that doesn't begin with excuses. Only our convenience suffers

3771 2018-12-07 23:13:56 Then why do we import shit tons of their oil still year after year?  We produce but clearly not nearly enough. I wish we did so we could have a president tell Saudi to fuck off.

3779 2018-12-07 23:13:08 Nora should be banned for life from talking about economics or oil and gas, she’s knows nothing about either.  When her stupidity is exposed she runs and hides.
3780 2018-12-07 23:13:07 Yes, it does, because oil is killing the planet. Its time to move on, old man.
3781 2018-12-07 23:13:04 He is the one along with Butts who put forth destructive policies that brought the oil industry  to their knees. So who else would you blame?

3784 2018-12-07 23:12:32 No, I do not drive a vehicle. I do not invest in oil & gas, I made decisions to turn off the tap as much as I can (I rarely travel by plane unless an emergency or unavoidable, I eat local as much as I can to try to eliminate transport of my food, and I try to walk or bike.

3794 2018-12-07 23:11:32 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
3795 2018-12-07 23:11:20 Hey genius. Trump isn't concerned with Saudi oil. We need them because of their opposition to Iran. I know geopolitics isn't part of a Dems knowledge base, but you either use it or get used by it.
3796 2018-12-07 23:11:02 My Dominican people how do you spell oil in Spanish. I’m having trouble
3797 2018-12-07 23:10:44 But jokes aside, if @realDonaldTrump can call a former oil magnate (Rex Tillerson) the term he called him this afternoon, doesn't that imply he will call Bubu worse?
Chai, see finish e no good at all.
3798 2018-12-07 23:10:39 Oil will never run out...abiotic so therefore renewable......
3799 2018-12-07 23:10:37 This plus a soothing bath with essentials oils of your choice, I like to put milk & honey bubble bath in with epsom salt and lavender oil.... maybe even read a book or write with a glass of wine ... get you some peace and quiet too it really helps to be in your own company

3802 2018-12-07 23:10:24 it was always fucking OIL
3803 2018-12-07 23:10:24 CBD OIL
3804 2018-12-07 23:10:16 @bullTesla But you may be talking to Big Motor & Big Oil aliases. Where the ammount of short $s is both chicken shit & written off in the Marketing Budgets gone bye. @TeslaOpinion @TeslaPodcast @EVNewsDaily @DMC_Ryan @FredericLambert
3805 2018-12-07 23:10:12 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
3806 2018-12-07 23:10:07 Hey, All, I don't know Tillerson, but I grew up among the leaders in the oil industry.  Tillerson has to be way smart to have gotten to the head of Exxon.  He will play this right.  I expect positive stuff from Tillerson.
3807 2018-12-07 23:09:56 Just a responding as usual. Guess, Tillerson the oil man, shot first.  He probably thought State department was all about oil.
3808 2018-12-07 23:09:48 ylang ylang  mix it in some grape seed oil and people will be on you all day
3809 2018-12-07 23:09:35 Ffs.
Norway is completely different.
It exports Fish & oil, nothing the EU can interfere with.
And it imports Everything else.
Why not sign up to make sure everything u import is standardized
3810 2018-12-07 23:09:32 todoroki - elegant oil painter??? can make shit look professional ever since he was like 2 tbh. he'd also probably dabble in like water colors tbh
kirishima - probably took an art class to just get the credit in but started to really like it??? just likes to try out new things.
3811 2018-12-07 23:09:28 Of course the former CEO of the biggest oil corp in the world is exactly that. Sure. We believe it. This is actually pure slandering - go on Rex, sue the orange moron.
3812 2018-12-07 23:09:25 I thought it was common sense that you’re supposed to dilute it with a carrier oil... it says so on the fuckin bottles.
3813 2018-12-07 23:09:11 The vape store by 5 minute oil change nd i think online
3814 2018-12-07 23:09:02 Oil more points than kittens.
3815 2018-12-07 23:08:57 Anything for Oil, you know  . . .
3816 2018-12-07 23:08:52 
3817 2018-12-07 23:08:47 I heard Secretariat got lavender oil injected directly into his butt.

Hope it's not too late! I blew up an entire oil rig that sent a piece flying half way around the map to blow up a small gas station! It was an epic disaster
3819 2018-12-07 23:08:23 Actually you don’t get it! Reliance on Alberta oil has decreased from 6.% to 3.5% over GDP in just 5 years. We’re walking away from oil! The future is electric! You can’t stop progress!
3820 2018-12-07 23:08:02 Under $60 to fill my suburban with 93 octane. I’m going out on a limb to say oil stocks aren’t doing well right now.
3821 2018-12-07 23:07:48 My weeks recap:
- I got food poisoning & it pissed off my IBS
- I lost all of my finals notes with my sub notes in a backpack full of oil.
- my backpack is dead because of oil 
- My program cant figure their shit out
- I'm ~Br0Ke~ at
- I'm 80% sure my ankle has a stress fracture
3822 2018-12-07 23:07:42 AFP: Brazil environmental regulator denies French oil giant Total license to drill for crude in Amazon basin
3823 2018-12-07 23:07:39 And who is surprised at this...they created an island to steal natural gas and oil and now they want to steal/have farming rights on the moon....thieves through and through.
3824 2018-12-07 23:07:39 Rex Tillerson was the CEO of ExxonMobil, our largest oil company.  What does that say about the other oil company execs that you've based your climate policy around?
3825 2018-12-07 23:07:36 Maganar ka dutse!
3826 2018-12-07 23:07:32  No need for it, we have [oil] pipelines everywhere, enough public land turnover, especially when it harms preserved species, BLM needs to do its job and "protect environmentally sensitive areas" Like they claim, and not allow elected officials to sell off for private business.
3827 2018-12-07 23:07:27 @realDonaldTrump sir please we the people of Nigerians are suffering the price of oil is too high in my country Nigerian please sir come to our rescue
3828 2018-12-07 23:07:22 How is useing Saudi oil anymore enviromental than ours? Is their oil co2 free?
How can transporting it across oceans and then useing rail to move it around Canada better for the enviroment?
Why is it better to give the Saudi's our oil money instead of putting Canadians  to work?
3829 2018-12-07 23:07:18 Asked mam for some CBD oil for Christmas to keep me chill and she googled it and asked how she can ordered it without being arrested and if I know someone
3830 2018-12-07 23:07:15 BTW the UK might not buy your oil.
3831 2018-12-07 23:06:58 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
3832 2018-12-07 23:06:58 my god please please please get back on your TDS meds before your last two brain cells are fried like the guy that thinks WWII was about oil for the US... Get some help you'll feel better after
3833 2018-12-07 23:06:54 Calling Tillerson, who worked as a busboy, a janitor, and picked cotton as a kid in Oklahoma, then worked his way up from an engineering job to become the CEO of the world's largest oil company, a lazy dumbass is ridiculous.
3834 2018-12-07 23:06:52 I rub shea butter with Vitamin E oil all over my body every night 
3835 2018-12-07 23:06:42 US policy is that they don't import refined products. Adding refineries in CAN won't help since we can't get our products to Tidewater, and Quebec doesn't want Canadian oil. Besides, no one wants to invest $15B in a refinery in CAN  given our political climate.

 Stick to unions.
3836 2018-12-07 23:06:41 Somebody ain’t seen me with water and almond oil 
3837 2018-12-07 23:06:40 Lol wellll you need an oil change. You’ll be good tho
3838 2018-12-07 23:06:40 Hook me up with a oil change I need your tools lol
3839 2018-12-07 23:06:32 I hate taking my car for oil changes because at the end of it they tell me like 1,000 different things that are wrong with my car.
3840 2018-12-07 23:06:24 Let's not forget that the Senate were not too happy with Tillerson's nomination.  He was, after all, a CEO of an oil company.
3841 2018-12-07 23:06:23 Yes but the reason gas is as inexpensive as it is is because we buy it from all over the world. Imagine if France was “nationalist” when it came to oil
3842 2018-12-07 23:05:58 Now. What the government should have done, in hindsight, was to nationalise the North Sea but only in hindsight. Oil was still cheap then, even after the 1973 oil shock. The Norwegian oil fund only grew rapidly in the last 10 years or so.
3843 2018-12-07 23:05:52 I use olive oil.. but I gotta give it a good itch!  I’m gentle 
3844 2018-12-07 23:05:51 Do you put facial oil before or after moisterizer?
3845 2018-12-07 23:05:35 Been feeling like shit so treated myself... I'm shaven and covered in bio oil. I feel like a dolphin. #touchme
3846 2018-12-07 23:05:35 Like I just put oil in my car a couple days ago and when it stopped the light came on
3847 2018-12-07 23:05:18 In the finals year of #Watergate,  Yom kippur war happened and oil prices doubled causing stagnation, then #impeachment followed @chucktodd
3848 2018-12-07 23:05:12 @Rachel__Nichols this is something I've thought about for a while, but didn't want to bring up because I really love the show. But I think the question finally has to be asked: Can you not find a different sponsor than an oil company? It seems tone deaf and off-message
3849 2018-12-07 23:05:12 Do the first chips cooking, then fish. Keep fish warm on warming tray or low oven. Then blast the chips for their final cooking. It doesn’t take long if the oil is hot enough.
3850 2018-12-07 23:05:11 Oh I’m very out of olive oil, trust me, but I don’t get the Hanukkah joke part
3851 2018-12-07 23:05:10 But you "use cannabis"?  
Cannabis is used in three main forms: marijuana, hashish and hash oil
Marijuana is made from dried flowers and leaves of the cannabis plant.
3852 2018-12-07 23:04:56 I personally am excited that news came out today that were are now energy independent when it comes to oil. No more dealings with or pressure from corrupt saudis..
3853 2018-12-07 23:04:54 2.5 here in kano
3854 2018-12-07 23:04:51 Don’t care he’s dead. Whoever he was. There I said it. Knew I would If this f-ing twitter eulogising some anonymous old leftie continued long enough. Did he liberate Kuwait? Nah. Did he put out the oil field fires? Nah. He couldn’t even loose off a few tomahawks. He was rubbish.
3855 2018-12-07 23:04:35 It kind of varies, there are different ways to do it! But basically no red sauce. I think it's usually ricotta, or oil with herbs, or a white garlic sauce, then usually regular cheese on top. Sometimes toppings sometimes not.
3856 2018-12-07 23:04:32 This is what Americans need to see through. These politicians are about oil & their own self interests. They don’t give a damn about the greater good.

3861 2018-12-07 23:03:59 He should have never had been Sec  never any experience only oil man and was recommended by Condy Rice and President took her recommendation of him.
3862 2018-12-07 23:03:53 T-REX Tillerson... 

From Oil Major, to Private Schmuck, in 18 months. 

Ex-Sec-State, has the inviting comforts, 'o his Permian Basin, Fossil Bed. 

In truth, now that T-REX-T has been publicly humiliated by T-Rump, many times...

What Country Club, would have him, as a member?
3863 2018-12-07 23:03:50 Fuck the "Frogs". Should cut off the transfer payments they get. Hundreds of percent more than the rest of Canada. Also, they are sitting on huge oil/gas deposits in Gaspe Bay that the don't even realize.

3865 2018-12-07 23:03:32 Tillerson hired at Vladimir’s direction for oil connect; Trump didn’t personally know Rex.
3866 2018-12-07 23:03:30 They are totally fine with oil. Saudi oil from tankers that is.
3867 2018-12-07 23:03:14 Have you tried CBD oil at all? It helps my anxiety immensely.
3868 2018-12-07 23:03:05 Hard pass on the 2nd biggest recipient of oil money as the Democratic nominee for president when climate change is already destroying the planet.
3869 2018-12-07 23:02:51 Just cook everything in a shit load of oil so nothing sticks. You'll be 600lbs but no sticky pots.

3872 2018-12-07 23:02:43 I’m here getting an oil change and Onew’s Blue wanted to come on but I can’t listen to it WITHOUT BOTH HEADPHONES BUT I NEED TO BE ALERT I HATE LIFE

A single government policy can make or break a millionaire
3878 2018-12-07 23:02:07 You hired Tillerson why? For Putin & his dreams of Alaskan oil drilling, or because you're a poor judge of character (having none yourself), or both?
3879 2018-12-07 23:02:00 Nigeria will not return to the period when;

A president & his vice called each other THIEVES

UN building & Police HQ were bombed

A sitting gov was abducted

650k jobseekers were scammed, killing 20 of them

Two big ships disappeared with crude oil without a trace

Never Again
3880 2018-12-07 23:02:00 TRUE.  don't forget both Tillerson for OIL $ + trump for loans+$ deals both are 
compromised by Putin
3881 2018-12-07 23:01:54 He accepted small dollar donations from everyone. Oil companies are the largest employers in TX. Anyone who works for an oil company down to the dude behind the counter at the shell station counts as “oil industry.” He has a 95% rating from environmental grps, same as Bernie.
3882 2018-12-07 23:01:52 "Dumb as a rock" Tillerson was CEO of Exxon Mobil, the largest oil company and the third largest company in the world!
Trump was/is a real estate hustler.
3883 2018-12-07 23:01:47 Today at wellness PD I made my own cranky oil! Sharp and sensitive more than adequately describe my mood lately! I may need a bucket of cranky oil! 
3884 2018-12-07 23:01:46 Wow, I know for a fact, America has a very large supply of oil. Much has not even been tapped or touched yet.
3885 2018-12-07 23:01:43 Lmao chill .. I blame the oil 
3886 2018-12-07 23:01:39 Some years ago the give all the oil Company's employee's who had Billions in equipment there and told them they had 48 hrs to get and stole all of it.
3887 2018-12-07 23:01:29 Nice PM Alberta is not used to being needy so great help but rail cars or pipelines there is a glut of oil in marketplace
3888 2018-12-07 23:01:23 Ask any economist, PDP destroyed Nigeria, billions from Oil boom was wasted.

-No Refinery to stop importing, wasting 2 trillions yearly.
-No railway systems.
-No Electricity.
-Infrastructure collapsed.
-No saving and still Borrowed.

Is 16 years not enough?
3889 2018-12-07 23:01:18 I am no fan of CBD only. I grow and make my own coconut oil extraction. Pain is never gone but easier to deal with and I sleep well.
3890 2018-12-07 23:01:18 Why are u elderly politicians don't av shame again, Okupe, pls tel me d massive project dat was done for good 16 years even when crude oil price was above 105 per barrel, if OBJ/ATIKU, GEJ/SAMBO, laid good platform, we won't be where we're today, God Almighty Wil judge u all.

3892 2018-12-07 23:01:17 Arab oil embargo caused CAFE standards to be implemented and the US economy had massive energy efficiency gains on those subsequent years
3893 2018-12-07 23:01:12 Then where will our oil come from? How will your electronic device get made? Car run? 

Have you reduced your use of oil? Do you use public transit, for example? Or an electric car?
3894 2018-12-07 23:01:09 The truth is still is our past is terribly hunting us. We didnt build our country when we had money. We enriched a few. We prolly will never have that kinda money again thanks to the unstable oil prices. Buhari is just the scape goat here. He came when every was crashing tbh.
3895 2018-12-07 23:01:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, and removal.
3896 2018-12-07 23:01:08 RT LoriShemek: The word “vegetable” might make you think vegetable oils are healthy, but they are actually high in omega 6 fats, highly processed, inflammatory & devoid of much nutritional value. 

Use this instead: Coconut oil, avocado oil, and of course olive oil are excel…

3899 2018-12-07 23:01:01 I had to read this twice because the first time I thought this was a Hanukkah joke and not you actually being out of olive oil.
3900 2018-12-07 23:01:00 Totally agree. Pipeline IS the best way. Wasnt picking on AB oil. Sorry if you took it that way. I'm on AB side when it comes to getting our oil to market. BUT, if we dont do a rigorous assessment to build pipelines..every protester on the planet will whine. Thats what C69's  for
3901 2018-12-07 23:01:00 This says as much about the person who selected someone "dumb as a rock" as SOS as it does the one who was selected. trump chose the man putin told him to choose, the man who received Russia's highest honor for signing the most lucrative but most SANCTIONED oil deal in history.
3902 2018-12-07 23:00:59 Grapeseed oil
3903 2018-12-07 23:00:45 Not correct. Oil brings in far more money then the Ontario auto industry and Quebec aerospace combined.

3907 2018-12-07 23:00:00 To give you a heads up, I don’t doubt the science on man-made climate change.  Basically we have been burning the buried energy of the Carboniferous for the past 200 years. The industrial revolution was built on coal. Add the oil of the Tethys and that is a lot of CO2.
3908 2018-12-07 22:59:57 Coconut oil mixed with baking soda and a drop of Peppermint Oil extract.  I was using Tom's of Maine way back but Crest bought them out and added Fluoride back in.  I have well water with a nice 7.5 pH level as well.
3909 2018-12-07 22:59:39 Its working the other way round here. Fields are full of maize, wheat, corn, oil seed rape. There's been an explosion in small bird's, wild boar, deer, insects and birds of prey.

3912 2018-12-07 22:59:09 Wow!  You say that about one of the most respected leaders in the Oil business?  To my knowledge he never took a business into bankruptcy? Nor destroy his suppliers. Rubbishing other people reflects badly, on you!.
3913 2018-12-07 22:59:09 Elites? Tillerson worked as a busboy, a janitor, and picked cotton as a kid in Oklahoma. Worked his way up from an engineering job to become the CEO of the world's largest oil company. Meanwhile, Trump was a millionaire in elementary school and inherited his daddy's business.
3914 2018-12-07 22:59:07 Trudeau bought a pipeline that will contribute to oil sands emissions *increasing*.

3916 2018-12-07 22:59:00 #WhatCanadaLoses : the "trending" hashtag that oil money bought...I remember the good old days when that money was spent on bs thinktank studies that always seem to arrive at the conclusion increased oil production = good, environmental controls = bad.

3920 2018-12-07 22:58:42 I would agree that Energy East is ideal but QC is an issue until they are cut off from SA oil or green / human rights tax to impose a tariff on oil from outside of Canada w/o similar regs. Technically Canada could export from Mtl or TO or Thunder Bay

Ain't gonna happen. Taxes too low, welfare to low! Awe that's why we need another doing of illegals. Keep welfare strong, while our aged are trying to decide whether to but oil for heat or medication!
3924 2018-12-07 22:58:15 @escalantenelin 
Otros de los históricamente beneficiados por los recortes de la OPEP son los productores EEUU de shale oil. Los costos de producción siguen bajando y ellos toman la ventaja de los volúmenes.
3925 2018-12-07 22:57:58 Really - where would they buy their oil, water and energy from?
3926 2018-12-07 22:57:53 For Tillerson being dumb as a rock he surly ran one of the most successful oil companies and never went bankrupt!
3927 2018-12-07 22:57:52 burn all the base of oil in Iran !!!!!!
3928 2018-12-07 22:57:35 That's a terrible place to put the guns. They should in the same aisle with the motor oil and car care products.
3929 2018-12-07 22:57:32 *perhaps if Iraq didnt sit on vast oil reserves that Halliburton serviced maybe those ethics wouldnt have been so strong?
3930 2018-12-07 22:57:27 #Islamabad is officially becoming an authoritarian seat of power with red mist descending from the mountains , communism n islam don’t mix as oil n water no matter how much we try , it’s better to let be as both oil n water have their own individual significance #ordinance #cpec
3931 2018-12-07 22:57:20 When the head of an oil company seems more moral,honest and less led by greed and revenue than your president you know you have a problem. #TrumpLies #Trump

3933 2018-12-07 22:57:14 JT is so far out of touch it’s scary, has no idea what it’s like to wonder if he is going to be able to pay the mortgage or feed his family, Should be absolutely ashamed of himself and his minister of natural resources for being so patronizing to the oil and gas workers.
3934 2018-12-07 22:57:07 There is also the question about how they intend to stop the Saudi oil up the St. Lawrence. After all oil is oil right?!
3935 2018-12-07 22:57:03 Good luck getting oil to tide water if that happens
3936 2018-12-07 22:56:33 Are we drilling for cruel oil
3937 2018-12-07 22:56:32 I'm sure old Rex knew nothing of the Rosneft oil deal. Kushner and Flynn were planning the largest OIL deal in history. Now why would Rex care about oil, he was all about public service. He was not a victim.
3938 2018-12-07 22:56:31 Oh FGS. Go pedal whale oil for so the good you're doing for miners.

3943 2018-12-07 22:55:56 Do these women have access to healthcare insurance? Your vote for tax reform and oil drilling made it harder for them to be insured!
3944 2018-12-07 22:55:54 I just found that : Nowadays , the terrorism of the world seems not from the Mid East, but from the US government. As we know, they are always making deals with the terrorism of Mid East, just for their profits in oil business. They are now already become the trouble maker .
3945 2018-12-07 22:55:41 @griffinmcelroy re: ending to Petal to the Metal. How dare you I am crying in this Honda service shop waiting for my oil change to finish up
3946 2018-12-07 22:55:41 So thankful the guys at fast eddies!!!! Came for an oil change and found out my serpentine belt was about to break! They did it without hesitation to make sure my bundle of joy in the back was safe  #thankful
3947 2018-12-07 22:55:39 Why leaving the east and the south Africa, Australia & NZ.
Middle East was created by the Man who developed keen interest with Suez canal and Persian oil devastating the Iranians.
3948 2018-12-07 22:55:24 نعم كلامه سليم سوت بشهرين شي محد يسويه بدهر لنها أخجلت العمال وأضعفتهم ودخلتنى بطوفه،، بفض الإضراب،،، امى الإنجازات الحقيقه فالمسار لها نصيب الأسد وأيضآ النقابه الحاليه مع اخلافي معها في امور كثيره  لكن لها دور كبير ولها انجازاتها اما التغيير عطني إنجاز او اثنين لها!؟؟
3949 2018-12-07 22:55:23 That can always be true if concerns about political stability, interest rates, trade tensions, lower than expected labor and wage results, higher oil prices, reduced oil output are considered emotion, though. Right?
3950 2018-12-07 22:55:13 A heated oil treatment massage would be mad clutch right now
3951 2018-12-07 22:55:09 Probably so considering oil is more lucrative than real estate.

3957 2018-12-07 22:54:32 It is established fact that majority 9/11 hijackers  were from Saudi Arabia (check it out) "Weapons of mass etc" was  calculated lie to manipulate public opinion to favor war with Iraq (really for oil) Bush/mil advisors knew no WMDs 1000s US soldiers killed  Mission Accomplished?

3962 2018-12-07 22:54:09 Your hyperbole doesn't make your views any more pragmatic. The truth is we ought to do both. We need to make investments into renewable energy and technologies BUT also recognize that for the time being we can't just stop using oil. Oil & Gas is not a sin. Do you drive a vehicle?
3963 2018-12-07 22:53:39 Holds in the heat but for some reason, it helps. I rub a little oil too before.
3964 2018-12-07 22:53:27 That didn’t work. Next up duct tape and oil stick?!

3969 2018-12-07 22:52:41 A load of right wing drivel. I have more imagination in my toe nail than you will ever have in your entire existence. Stop spewing BS and tell us how you propose to make things better. Be sure to include gutted oil prices, a flood, a fire & no pipeline and crumbled infrastructure
3970 2018-12-07 22:52:38 The guy very successfully ran a major integrated oil company so he is anything but dumb. Whether he was effective as Sos can be debated. Trump's 8th grade retort betrays his peevishness. It doesn't smell, it only reads.

3973 2018-12-07 22:52:16 It’s funny how you don’t indicate what percentage of oil that we import. (Fake president)
3974 2018-12-07 22:52:16 Horgan speaks for himself! A diversified energy sector is imperative...BC Hydro doesn't have the capacity to generate the $$ oil does, so guess whose paying the losses?!
3975 2018-12-07 22:52:05 I agree. I always thought it had to do with #Russia, #Putin, oil and sanctions. Let’s ask #RobertMueller.
3976 2018-12-07 22:52:01 Forgot how much I love tea tree oil shampoo
3977 2018-12-07 22:51:57 Saint Bernard on the name of Jesus... “your name is oil poured out”... the name of Jesus is like oil BECAUSE “when preached it gives light, when meditated it nourishes, when invoked it relieves and soothes.”
3978 2018-12-07 22:51:51 Having to rely on #Albertaenergy sector is a burden for all Canadians from coast to coast relying on oil prices. Besides if we as a society want to move forward we need to created solution and depart from confort.Therefore, I challenge this youth generation, to bring their genius
3979 2018-12-07 22:51:49 Would we be better off buying the oil from the Middle East ?
3980 2018-12-07 22:51:46 But they said that poor Scotland wouldn’t survive, this bad oil will make us poorer they said? LOL 
3981 2018-12-07 22:51:43 The Saudis just raised the price of oil.  Looks like Trump forgot the first rule of prostitution—you need to get paid.
3982 2018-12-07 22:51:42 4. I haven’t used there leave in conditioner because Sally’s didn’t have it, but I use a dollar store leave in right now for my LOC method. So I put my leave in on my hair strands and then put my black castor oil or Africa oil on my hair and scalp.
3983 2018-12-07 22:51:10 Yes, but it’s a matter of emphasis; he rarely foregrounds policy. I know what he stands for, but how would he govern? Beto is not clear on M4All & his centrist record on financial regulation, oil/gas when he was in office raises concerns. Not disqualifying, but concerning.
3984 2018-12-07 22:51:09 Yes but he will accept oil transfer payments. Gladly.

3993 2018-12-07 22:50:30 It’s cherry picking. The quoted paragraphs don’t even show what’s stated in the headline. And since you give credence to scientists and their credentials, why side with the extreme minority? Why side with old big oil propaganda (Exxon even accepts manmade global warming now)?
3994 2018-12-07 22:50:11 Trump constantly tweets about the news being fake. The irony is rich in that almost everything he says is either false or deceptive. For example, his claim that he needed to tread softly with the Saudis about the Khashoggi murder to keep oil prices low turns out to be nonsense...

4000 2018-12-07 22:49:16 Tillerson was the key to why the Russian sanctions were going to be listed.  Exxon has the technology to get oil that the Russians cannot get to...Tillerson was going to be used as a patsy to negotiate that all away.
4001 2018-12-07 22:49:08 I been waiting waaaaaay too long for a simple oil change and tire rotation 
4002 2018-12-07 22:49:04 Life is so much better now that I have an oil diffuser aimed directly up my nose.

4018 2018-12-07 22:47:30 Let’s recap Donny.  Rex successfully ran one the world’s largest oil companies during a period of exceptional growth. Whereas you’ve bankrupted six companies, you still fail to understand that your tariffs are paid by Americans and you believe that BIg MAC’s are health food. Sad.
4019 2018-12-07 22:47:30 Hello?
el Presidente needed Rex in that position temporarily to gather more evidence on TDS, since all the globalists love their oil tycoons...

Please be more aware of how the game is played
You can't just sit/wait for someone to explain it all to you #WAKEUP
4020 2018-12-07 22:47:23 #JustinTrudeau & the #Liberals are sure being stupid, shooting themselves in the foot so to speak-equalization pmts will be drastically reduced if Ab can't sell the oil! #TrudeauMustGo
4021 2018-12-07 22:47:18 ...and an individual like that ran a huge oil company making millions. That would be a proof that an average Joe can do the same thing and that US CEOs are overpaid.
4022 2018-12-07 22:47:15 Bullshit; Trump would know far more than Tillerson regarding business law. Trump is the President. Tillerson was CEO of an oil company
4023 2018-12-07 22:47:08 'Regionalist' pushes the big oil agenda as sprawlers keep sprawling. Old NIMBYs will let go or be dragged. Progress will happen with or without their cooperation.
4024 2018-12-07 22:46:59 I got an oil change and emissions in less than 20 minutes today.
4025 2018-12-07 22:46:59 What the hell are you talking about, oil money is how they were able to build up their infrastructure.
4026 2018-12-07 22:46:59 For some reason #Remoaners are tweeting video of a lady from #Norway who is #EU ‘friendly’

Just remember #Norway is floating on oil and has very different economy than UK 

We have whole world to trade with and that is why #WTO #Brexit if EU can’t agree to FTA 

#StandUp4Brexit
4027 2018-12-07 22:46:50 Not to mention the reason Alberta tar sand oil is discounted so much is because of its low quality and difficulty to refine. Nobody wants it. So when world oil demand drops 10% Alberta oil will be the first cut and will have zero demand. We'll have an empty pipeline rusting away
4028 2018-12-07 22:46:46 13 track days out of the fronts 9 out of the rears. 15 track days down since I bought it and on my 3rd set of pads. Oil service for under £50. Brake fluid for £18 plugs for £25. Front discs £90 still on original set rear discs less still in originals.

Then talk to the World about oil consumption

4043 2018-12-07 22:45:35 Quick side note: PragerU is funded by a fracking company. In other words, an oil drilling company. If what you know of climate change comes from them, forget about considering them credible.
4044 2018-12-07 22:45:28 For his oil and Russian connections
4045 2018-12-07 22:45:12 Why was there only enough oil for one night? Sequestration?
4046 2018-12-07 22:45:03 Well I made it through the work day. I spent some time in the restroom crying. Then I took a walk and stopped at the holiday bazaar sale where a lady had an oil my mom always wore. The day isn’t over, but I braved not sitting in the house today.

4053 2018-12-07 22:44:49 Why do we have so many coal fired power plants? Because during the 1970s President Carter (D) mandated that power plants get off of oil and switch to cheap, plentiful COAL.  But Dems won't talk about that fact...
4054 2018-12-07 22:44:49 I don't get it: how a heavily subsidized province (Quebec) gets to decide the fate of economic activities of the productive provinces of Canada? They are too virtuos to deal with oil but not to receive assistance from Alberta. Ludicrous!
4055 2018-12-07 22:44:49 Baby oil & cotton wool for sticky marks removal works very well.
I find the tops of the thighs make the best spot, easy to apply and the skin around there doesn't distort much as you move around. Adjust position according to your skirt/dress length.

4058 2018-12-07 22:44:34 You forgot numbers. On how many burning that oil will kill due to climate breakdown. You could include the audio of thei drowning in floods, burning in fire tornados, or an asmatic child struggling to breathe.  Missed opportunity there.
4059 2018-12-07 22:44:31 Don’t be hopeful, we need to initiate change here in Colorado. We can’t allow those with flat earth scientific views who are in bed with big oil to dictate policy. It’s not going to happen and that orange buffoon in Washington isn’t going to help #ClimateChangeIsReal

4062 2018-12-07 22:44:18 Estoy en un capítulo de black mirror en el que recorro todas las estaciones de servicio y cuando llego tienen un cartel que dice NO HAY NAFTA SOLO GAS OIL
4063 2018-12-07 22:44:06 Me? I'm on the liberals side. 

You're favored politician likes that sweet oil or big pharma money? You want to pretend shes lazy. Did she kick your dog? Be honest, you hated her before this didnt you? No way you're a Democrat and just that petty. You can tell us.
4064 2018-12-07 22:44:04 Trump chose Rex Tillerson for Sec of State; had never met him and probably didn't know who the hell he was..CEO of Exxon-Mobile, best American friend of Putin w/ a 1/2 Tril $ Artic Oil Deal w/ the Russians on hold d/t Sanctions. I'm sure this is merely a coincidence (right ?)
4065 2018-12-07 22:43:54 I wanna do oil and body paint shows. Wine will also be involved.
4066 2018-12-07 22:43:45 Saudi oil is accepted with open arms 
4067 2018-12-07 22:43:41 A guess only ... the Russians suggested or wanted to deal with Tillerson as SecState because they were familiar with him after Exxon Rosneft oil deal. I do not believe Tillerson is/was corrupt. Not a fan of Exxon personally, but think Rex has ethics values Trump doesn't share.
4068 2018-12-07 22:43:38 Coconut oil is high in lauric acid and a naturally antiviral, antibacterial & antifungal food. Add 1-2 Tbsp. to your daily Green Smoothie!
4069 2018-12-07 22:43:37 We don’t produce enough to be self sufficient. If OPEC wants high oil prices they will get them since they set the price
4070 2018-12-07 22:43:33 And your oil
4071 2018-12-07 22:43:33 And that 3% work for the oil and coal companies. Therefore, they are paid to disagree.
4072 2018-12-07 22:43:29 His province buys $300m per month of Saudi oil and has taken over 211 billion dollars from Alberta that came from oil, I know CBC will not include that in a story because they don't want to offend Justin
4073 2018-12-07 22:43:28 Need oil to get renewables off the ground.  How do a lot of the parts of a Tesla car get manufactured?   Oil.
4074 2018-12-07 22:43:22 Our government ran the oil industry into the ground how can we trust them with a major migration pact GCM, with the UN,
4075 2018-12-07 22:43:21 What’s a bad idea? Impeachment? The only idea worse than that? Not impeaching. He has got to go. Before every single protected species is covered in oil.
4076 2018-12-07 22:43:17 Love the Kiehls midnight recovery oil  haven’t tried any of their other stuff yet
4077 2018-12-07 22:43:06 Today in 1904, comparative fuel trials begin between warships HMS Spiteful and HMS Peterel: Spiteful was the first warship powered solely by fuel oil, and the trials led to the obsolescence of coal in ships of the Royal Navy.
4078 2018-12-07 22:42:55 Such wonderful treasures we've destroyed.  All for oil, $$$, wood, palm oil. Too many people.  Stop having babies, clean up, recycle, stop poisoning our air, water, land and killing our wildlife.

4080 2018-12-07 22:42:51 It seems anyone who has a different opinion than yours, or follows our constitution,,or doesn't follow you, oil & chemical companies, or authoritarian rule basically is expendable in your corrupt world, like putin & russian mafia. You had Jeff sessions resign, & Whittaker put in.
4081 2018-12-07 22:42:46 My doctor said my elevated LDL count was due to a testing error, but she doesn’t know how much grass-fed butter and coconut oil I’ve been ingesting lately.
4082 2018-12-07 22:42:42 I’m kind of crazy. I like preventative checks. I’m 60 and have had 3!!! The last prep was a piece of cake. Less liquid and no taste so I drank iced tea and ginger ale. So much better than the motor oil of my first one
4083 2018-12-07 22:42:39 Baby did my oil change and I didnt even have to ask.
4084 2018-12-07 22:42:21 Sure, but if I were him I would refuse money from the oil and gas industry going forward
4085 2018-12-07 22:42:20 BS - have Quebecers all traded their cars for bikes?  You can't have it both ways - you can't use oil then claim to be morally superior
4086 2018-12-07 22:42:13 I would much rather have a President who unabashedly speaks his mind than one that is a slick snake oil salesman who is all smiles on the outside but is evil  behind our backs.

4087 2018-12-07 22:42:13 jesus h. christ Esq. can the little girls from jersey stop smelling the CBD oil in this coffee shop and order already??? please, my eyes have already rolled out of my head...
4088 2018-12-07 22:42:12 Young, aimless, impressionable men (mostly) are drawn to macho ideology, especially if it means they can dominate and control women (mostly) and feel they’re in control of their lives. War for oil, and the endless war on terror only breeds more discontent. 2/
4089 2018-12-07 22:41:59 I dream of soaking in a tub of lotion or warm oil.  I can't with this applying-every-day bullshit.

4091 2018-12-07 22:41:40 You never called me today. What about your oil change and stuff?????
4092 2018-12-07 22:41:32 @nadhimzahawi There are children & families supported by this world beating company. Will you support the Bloodhound project and getting it out of administration and back it proving that the UK is the source of world beating engineering? Come on.. It will use a lot of oil...
4093 2018-12-07 22:41:26 The oil price Representatives from Argentina,
4094 2018-12-07 22:41:19 You better watch the market, and oh by the way, OPEC is cutting Oil Production!! Thanks big mouth!
4095 2018-12-07 22:41:05 I recently started using CBD oil and it has changed my life already. No more stress or anxiety  
4096 2018-12-07 22:40:59 You should thank the government for oil and gas “subsidies”. Which aren’t really subsidies at all. They are simply tax breaks enjoyed by nearly every business in the country. Without them you would be paying more than $8 per gallon
4097 2018-12-07 22:40:35 They are protesting the globalist agenda. Nothing to do with oil price whatsoever. That was an excuse for the patriotic french to claim back their sovereignty. This is the 1st of many. They are trying to wrap this up under our noses quick time

4102 2018-12-07 22:39:56 Sephora has great minis for all of those that are a great deal because they are a bit pricey. I really suggest the tatcha water cream and the herbivore orchid oil because it doesn’t make your face greasy! 
4103 2018-12-07 22:39:45 Balsamic and olive oil is where it’s at though
4104 2018-12-07 22:39:44 We don't need your ugly inefficient wind mills. Texas has once again become the oil & gas mecca of the world with the new find in the Permian Basin. Take your over priced over supplemented wind mills and stuff it.
4105 2018-12-07 22:39:35 If one of the St. Lawrence Saudi tankers has an accident the oil will be easily cleaned up because all the raw sewage (that @cathmckenna has allowed to be) dumped by Qc cities (free pollution) will have a buoyancy effect on the oil making it easier to clean up.
4106 2018-12-07 22:39:21 If you don’t want oil, then importing foreign oil would be even worse. So I expect the Quebec premier to announce that his province will STOP importing foreign oil immediately & no longer wishes to receive transfer payments from the west!
4107 2018-12-07 22:39:16 “Oh magical monkey’s paw, give a president that uses Twitter to mock oil executives!”
4108 2018-12-07 22:39:11 Funny, Texas is doing well exporting oil.  Why isn’t Alberta?  Oh yeah, this government and federal government opposed pipelines!
4109 2018-12-07 22:39:11 Who cares? No news to report from the first minister’s meeting?Premiers and Trudeau fighting about GHG emissions plans,Trudeau refusing to pledge funds to buy rail oil cars for AB?They talk of bail outs for a few dairy farmers and nothing for 130,000 energy workers out of jobs!

4111 2018-12-07 22:39:02 Prince MBS willing to defy the wishes of Trump..." Dangerously relying on Putin's support... In the Shia-Suni front, Putin is on the Shia side... Most of his oil and gas is in Islamic territories backed/controlled by Iran. Push comes to shove... MBS may end up being shoved.
4112 2018-12-07 22:38:59 Had a 1.6 GLS hatchback in red with black velour interior. Looked really classy and Loved it. 
Shame i never did get to the bottom of the oil leak.

4114 2018-12-07 22:38:52 Yes, some of those service and government jobs are full-time. Rejoice! It doesn’t change the fact that oil and gas workers are suffering and don’t want EI to placate them.

4117 2018-12-07 22:38:47 Annointing oil
4118 2018-12-07 22:38:46 I dont have time for that shit. They're going in the pan with oil till they start to get are through and then I drain and add my meat.
4119 2018-12-07 22:38:46 You are correct. People die and are persecuted all over the world everyday to deliver oil to eastern Canada and NOBODY cares. It says a great deal of your character. How did you become an educator with a mind that doesn't work on compassion and lacks logical reasoning?
4120 2018-12-07 22:38:42 I want that roll-on!  We use essential oils a lot, and we've actually been discussing getting a few EO mixtures with CBD oil in them to see if they will have better results for my husbands back pain and my migraines. <3
4121 2018-12-07 22:38:41 You just don't know what you're talking about. Your brain tells you, massive corporation, international oil and gas deals so let me just chuck in 'complexity'. But clearly you don't know why it may or may not be complex.
4122 2018-12-07 22:38:39 Its either oil or Acrylic. I cant remember, but i had both types of paint. Im thinking Acrylic because i rmbr washing brushes in water. Haha!

4128 2018-12-07 22:37:59 @zevways Normally I’m very suspicious of Seeking Alpha but in your case I have made an exception. If you would in a future article show how the drop in oil will completely destabilize countries dependent on oil revenue. What happened Venezuela is about to happen in Middle East.

4132 2018-12-07 22:37:42 Serious.  No gold In Fort Knox.  No oil to support futures.  As soon as Bitcoin isn’t backed by bitcoins what is it worth?  Faith?   We need to think about this.
4133 2018-12-07 22:37:40 He meant to say “Western Canadian oil”.
4134 2018-12-07 22:37:35 Folks keep recommending cbd oil for my anxiety. Is there a kind you like? How do I even go about choosing one?
4135 2018-12-07 22:37:32 I remember that Tillerson was a Jewish slave doing their jobs. The Israelites and the ruthless Jews are the only ones who hold the criminal regime in Iran and they are preventing the full boycott of Iran's oil. Israeli and Jewish financiers are Satan
4136 2018-12-07 22:37:31 true, QC could be like AB or SK if they allowed oil and gas production, could make money off a pipeline for Cdn oil, but prefers to import sharia/ halal/ wahabbi OPEC oil.
4137 2018-12-07 22:37:27 18 in 1975. Vietnam War ended. Sony introduced Betamax. Jaws was released. Patty Hearst was arrested. Oil hit $13 a barrel, and Thatcher became the leader of the Tories, then in opposition.
4138 2018-12-07 22:37:27 Corrupt lying snake oil salesman!  Mexico is paying but I guess you want to use taxpayer money to give to your greedy kids and law breaking “friends” for a wall that won’t do anything good for the American people?  Maybe move to China and admire theirs instead?!
4139 2018-12-07 22:37:09 I don't think she's dumb. I think she's insidious.
4140 2018-12-07 22:37:00 Things just dont decouple easily.  I.e if Brent oil goes down WTI and others go down.  Birds of a feather stick togeather as they say.
4141 2018-12-07 22:36:57 The question for me is why Wynne chose those targets while oil sands gets to expand to 100Mt/year.
4142 2018-12-07 22:36:56 How exactly does oil contribute to climate change ? Be specific
4143 2018-12-07 22:36:49 @aishatyler how much of that Castrol Motor Oil $$$ are you seeing for all your hocking on the @adamcarolla pod?

4147 2018-12-07 22:36:36 Trump calls Rex Tillerson "dumb as a rock." You mean the ex CEO of Exxon Mobile?????.....I don't think so BC that would mean there are a lot of dumb people in the oil industry and that's not very likely. Rex just has the gumption and balls to call out 45 on his crimes & misdeeds

4152 2018-12-07 22:35:50 Prices have started recovering yesterday after OPEC and allies have agreed to slash 1.2M bpd of production. But given that the US has just recently become the biggest producer of oil and Trump dont want high oil prices, they are bound to put more in the market.
4153 2018-12-07 22:35:46 He's ok with murder as long as that oil $$ keep coming in? So ready for @SenCoryGardner to go!
4154 2018-12-07 22:35:35 Deportations rose, ICE grew, stocks crashed. Yes, media has partisan bias, R vs D, but they're still center-right establishment.

Obama was pro:
- Bush tax cuts for rich
- Deregulation of banks
- Corporate subsidies
- Big oil
- War
- Gun

Pretty right-wing.
4155 2018-12-07 22:35:34 U.S. Oil Exports Are Rising. So Is the Trade Deficit.
4156 2018-12-07 22:35:34 I wonder if all the "little bit of rain and Vegas people can't drive" people understand that the roads are slick with oil after having no rain for months. Making driving conditions drastically different from normal.
4157 2018-12-07 22:35:26 I’ve used CBD oil for my anxiety and depression and feel it did a wonderful job balancing me out.  Helped me sleep a lot better too.
4158 2018-12-07 22:35:21 @coreylandsberg can tell you about CBD oil too, Dan
4159 2018-12-07 22:35:20 Saw a Toyota Tercell Rollin coal today... I mean maybe it was just burning oil really bad
4160 2018-12-07 22:35:00 The carbon emissions count in Canada is severely low compared to coal burning countries like China. Besides, a vegan burger wouldn't change the amount of processing needed to create the burger- which again, uses oil and gas.

4170 2018-12-07 22:34:06 america is itself not customer of american companies which are extracting oil from all over the world. 
That is the story.

4180 2018-12-07 22:32:38 I dislike Canada's dependency on oil for it's economy. Oil is fantastic, don't get me wrong. Plastics and other non combustible uses are invaluable. Which is why I would like us to reduce our comsumption for things that can be done without oil.

4197 2018-12-07 22:31:19 No. Perfection would be small pieces of 12yo Manchego cheese aged in olive oil wrapped in prosciutto with strawberry cheesecake for dessert.
4198 2018-12-07 22:31:16 Thanks for including this dumb old oil and gas trader!

4201 2018-12-07 22:31:07 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

4204 2018-12-07 22:30:42 The world needs clean energy. Solar, wind. Not all oil. There are many alternatives, but since you only watch Faux Entertainment, I'm sure you don't know.
4205 2018-12-07 22:30:39 Wiki says it all, all of UAE made its money from the oil industry

4208 2018-12-07 22:30:25 I really enjoy the experience of oil changes or emissions from Grease Monkey, especially the one on 114 s by The District. Free popcorn and soda, great service, good price, low pressure, free car wash. Highly recommend.

4210 2018-12-07 22:30:21 During the Arab Oil Embaro, Nixon set a national speed limit of 55mph in an effort to reduce fuel consumption.  Ever hear a Democrat propose such a thing?? Then Carter demanded that utility co's switch from oil to COAL, creating 100s of coal power plants.

4214 2018-12-07 22:30:01 for my birthday, my uncle gave me a $12 off an oil change coupon, a toys r us gift card, a subway gift card, and a chipotle gift card
4215 2018-12-07 22:30:01 Until it is leveraged.  Then a Bitcoin won’t be worth a Bitcoin.  Look what we did to oil futures.  Each barrel of oil represents some number greater than 1.  Lol.  Gold too.

4224 2018-12-07 22:29:41 That’s about a year and 3 months of global oil use.  That’s how much humans use, all the time
4225 2018-12-07 22:29:39 He said troops should have stolen Iraq’s oil. Orders would be refused but even the news would get thousands of Americans killed.

4227 2018-12-07 22:29:33 2 years ago, you were "reporting" that Tillerson's appointment would be proof that the administration was : 

1.  Only out to enrich themselves
2.  Tillerson was a tool of Russia through XOM oil deals and @potus owed Putin.

But now he's a resistance hero

It's Saudi Arabia's location & their willingness to allow us to keep/deploy troops to the region:US hegemony @ stake
4235 2018-12-07 22:28:43 Trudeau has always wanted to keep Oil in the ground.
4236 2018-12-07 22:28:18 Cite these multiple "resistance media" lines that were so prevelant please. Cuz I dont recall that. Just that he was touted as a billionaire big oil guy.
4237 2018-12-07 22:28:16 Tillerson ran the biggest oil company on Earth. You ran casinos into the ground.

And here comes Meuller. Game over, man!

4240 2018-12-07 22:28:02 I have so many mixed thoughts about it. I've never been for legalization of recreational use. Medical use, only in pill, oil form. Not Doobie use. Inhaling pot has the same side effects of cigarette use with lung damage. That's all I got.

4247 2018-12-07 22:27:13 Tillerson ran one of the largest companies in America and if he needed 25 billion to build a oil field he just signed for it. Unlike you who can’t run a company without going bankrupt or using mafia tactics. Who’s dumbed as a rock? Your a despicable human

4257 2018-12-07 22:25:25 Yeah he’s a cheap snake oil salesman. You’d think even Kentucky would have caught on by now.
4258 2018-12-07 22:25:19 Hmm, @POTUS griping about rising oil prices and insisting OPEC lower the costs while we EXPORT oil? What's wrong with THAT picture!
4259 2018-12-07 22:25:16 Place is called Pressed. There’s one in Nashua and one in Burlington. Shit wasn’t cheap tho- like $8. (Wife surprised me lol) But the quality is good. I felt great for several hours. I’d trust their cbd over the corner bodega cbd oil

4265 2018-12-07 22:24:14 So the oil industry that burns massive quanties of natural gas (which it gets basically for free, and without royalties) doesn't consume?

4269 2018-12-07 22:23:28 I like the oil suggestion best.
4270 2018-12-07 22:23:27 The okay and alright will kill a few.
4271 2018-12-07 22:23:26 I suppose, but intelligent people look for alternatives to the death of a planet and it's people instead of going for the money in dirty oil.

4273 2018-12-07 22:22:59 WCS differentials have narrowed, interest rate hikes are more subdued, and now OPEC is curtailing, yet heavy oil names remain at all-time lows.

4277 2018-12-07 22:22:41 There's nothing factual in the tweet at all. 

'Alberta' doesn't make transfer payments, they are distributed from general federal revenues. And governments do not buy oil from anyone, private corporations do (eg Irving)

4285 2018-12-07 22:21:56 The olive oil was closer.
4286 2018-12-07 22:21:52 I don’t really understand this Wesyern pain thing.  When oil was sky high, and businesses in Ont were folding like cards fue to high guel/telated costs, lots of workers from Ont went to get jobs in Alberta. Why aren’t Albertans moving to Ont for jobs?
4287 2018-12-07 22:21:42 You mean those Nigerians who believe(d) Buhari is Jubrim from Sudan and Nigeria has to share 50% of our oil revenues to jubrin's family from Sudan? Abi those who bathed with salt and drank salt water during the Ebola outbreak?

4290 2018-12-07 22:21:32 Do check drug interactions with CBD oil before using it. It’s showing huge potential in treating anxiety, but it does operate on receptors in the brain, so it could prevent other things from working, or enhance them.
4291 2018-12-07 22:21:24 Thank you President Obama for making this possible by lifting the crude oil export ban back in 2015. Just like the economy and unemployment all vestiges of the previous administration. All @realDonaldTrump had to do was not screw it up.

4296 2018-12-07 22:20:54 Yes. It was an amazing military victory. But the crazy part is that we only had enough oil for maybe one night. It lasted for eight nights. Eight Nights! Crazy.
4297 2018-12-07 22:20:49 Just got a free oil change at my car’s dealership and the guys helping me called me, “young lady” and I’m pretty sure I’m about 10 years older than him.

4300 2018-12-07 22:20:39 Oil was used to create your gaming platforms.  FYI.  And you probably drive a car, but if not, you take transit.  All of which require/required oil for operation/production.
4301 2018-12-07 22:20:28 Putin and OPEC cut oil production by 1.25mm barrels/day. 
Putin picked Rex Tillerson for Secretary if State. 
@realDonaldTrump lashing out at Tillerson is also a cry to Putin.

4311 2018-12-07 22:19:29 You know losing oil is actually a thing in that industry right? The problem is we need good managers to control the loss but under the present admin the loss has grown exponentially

4313 2018-12-07 22:19:20 Rex Tillerson managed during 10 years the biggest oil corporation of the world, Exxon Mobil; a $350 billions worth company (imagine Trump Organization multiplied by 100). Between you and Tillerson, there is no comparisons. He did not receive a small loan from his father.
4314 2018-12-07 22:19:17 The article shlomo sent said he got millions but couldn’t get back in oil until 2027 and if he did he don’t get it. He did something for that.
4315 2018-12-07 22:19:15 Alberta's down turn is not PMs doing as Andy keeps trying to say - its pcs lack of taking care of herritage fund not taxing properly coupled with the glut in oil regardless of prices or pipelines too much oil
4316 2018-12-07 22:19:13 The timing of this tweet is brilliant in support of PM’s messaging!

Asked for them to take it off, got declined, they agreed the job was badly done only for them to add more shine and send me off 
4320 2018-12-07 22:18:57 Turmeric paste (tumeric powder and water) helps, you can also add a little bit of lemon juice to the paste but if you don’t have it’s fine.

Wash it off when it’s dry and then apply either olive or coconut oil for moisture. Repeat for a few days and it should be gone.

4324 2018-12-07 22:18:37 You know that argan oil that's great for your skin? It comes from the seeds of the fruit the goats have eaten. They pass through the goats undigested and are then pressed for the oil. Lovely.
4325 2018-12-07 22:18:17 @brosisbeardoil Just got my order! Quick question: After applying the oil, are there downsides to a quick combing? Like would that remove it?

You need to go study the history of oil companies my friend.
I knew the guy was a disaster from the get go. 
4333 2018-12-07 22:17:01 @shaybaani You think examining the links of a Texas pol to oil in the context of the political immediacy of climate change is effed? (you're woefully uninformed on the matter, FYI).

Don't look for messiahs, friend; they're not coming.
4334 2018-12-07 22:16:58 thank God for coconut oil 
4335 2018-12-07 22:16:56 You  know why?

two major factors come to play

The oil industry through the valley is centered in Bakersfield with production reaching a 100 mile radius

The mountains at that end of the valley tend to capture everything from Stockton south, and much bay area pollution as well

4337 2018-12-07 22:16:45 Yeah Pey, she probably needs her oil changed since it hasn’t been done since she got her car. Go ahead and get the oil to do that
4338 2018-12-07 22:16:45 I take it you don’t spend much time in Calgary or with oil and gas workers. 

New part-time service jobs don’t make up for lost six figure oil and gas jobs.
4339 2018-12-07 22:16:31 i think the little man inside the machine who sucks up the oil and then spits it through the tube was tired
4340 2018-12-07 22:16:31 Hi, this is Joseph  Thanks for reaching out.  Yes you would need the fuel and oil drained, and  sturdy outer packaging.  Are you shipping express or ground?
4341 2018-12-07 22:16:27 It’s not logistically prudent to manufacture things in Alberta ... you know since much of the stuff that is needed to manufacture things would have to be shipped here and then back, on vehicles that run on gas that’s made from oil which nobody wants to use

4346 2018-12-07 22:15:50 .@realDonaldTrump, 
Ummm Donald,
When the Dow is down by the % that oil is up for most Americans that's not 'WINNING!'
4347 2018-12-07 22:15:39 Ha, zo, ja. Intussen zien we echter wel dat crude oil price/barrel laag blijft. 1/Taksen hier maken dat die prijsdaling nauwelijks doorsijpelt. 2/Dure Elektriciteitsprijs is idd gevolg v potje Groene Stroom die Groenadepten er van gemaakt hebben, vooral afschaf v nucleair.
4348 2018-12-07 22:15:38 #freecodefridaycontest I blew up an oil container and ten trucks in just cause 3
4349 2018-12-07 22:15:35 What does Oil. Drum road mean?
4350 2018-12-07 22:15:33 @BetoORourke had no legitimate primary opponent (runner up spent like $10k), which meant none of Beto shitty votes came 2 light. He supports fracking (86 times worse than coal), voted 2 end 40 year law on limiting oil exports, fast tracked TPP, deregulated banks. He’s horrible
4351 2018-12-07 22:15:23 Rex being an oil man it must be sedimentary.
4352 2018-12-07 22:15:16 It is a path forward to clean energy. Oil products not so much. 
We would be  in a while different world if Goodyear and Standard oil and other petro cos. didnt fuck shit up in in 1938 when they dismantled electric car lines throughout the country only to be replaces w gas buses
4353 2018-12-07 22:15:09 Like what sort of green economy? Unless you can spell it out, this is just another talking point. Is the world supposed to do without plastics? That's actually where heavy oil really shines, manufacturing. So what is this magical green industry that doesn't require oil products?
4354 2018-12-07 22:15:06 First of all I wouldn’t trust it mainly because it they fried the fish 9/10 they cooked the wings and fries in the same oil.. so that’s cross contamination

4357 2018-12-07 22:14:43 I don't think you get to be the CEO of the world's largest oil company by being a dumb as a rock and lazy.
Compared to Exxon Mobil, The Trump Organization is a popsicle stand.
4358 2018-12-07 22:14:40 おはようございます！
ありがとうございます
4359 2018-12-07 22:14:37 Clean and sustainable, like a bunch of diesel trains running the oil to the coast and US.  Instead of adding 1500km to the existing 47000km of existing pipeline.  Makes sense.
4360 2018-12-07 22:14:26 I heard Putin’s pick for S of S was Tillerson. It was an oil bro thing they had goin’ on. Now that you’ve been outed with regards to Russia and are no longer “useful asset”, you’re now free to dump on Rex?
4361 2018-12-07 22:14:26 Cbd oil, sry.
4362 2018-12-07 22:14:14 I’m sorry, leave in conditioner, hair volumizer, dry shampoo whatever.   Serious question, what kind of studies are that are sure CVS oil is good for your hair? I haven’t looked, I can’t imagine there’s been a lot of studies since it’s recently been used but idk
4363 2018-12-07 22:14:08 oh for god’s sake. this is truly vomit-inducing. this guy works for w. oil$. believe me, the bushes were NEVER part of MY family. and of cousre, not part of theirs. while ghwb had some good qualities, not one member of that family gave a flip about me or any member of my family
4364 2018-12-07 22:14:06 Then how will you provide the $600 billion to the DOD?  I’m sure Big Oil wouldn’t be pleased to lose out on their subsidies, as well.
4365 2018-12-07 22:14:02 They spew this rhetoric w/a straight face ... just can’t find the words! The gall, the attitude of entitlement! Has it got to the point where the hypocrisy is starring them in the face & there no hint of recognizing it?! The f’n foreign oil is forever com’n down the St. Lawrence!
4366 2018-12-07 22:13:57 I got fkn face oil in both my eyes I can’t see
4367 2018-12-07 22:13:49 @realDonaldTrump We know that OPEC orders have no credit, and some countries are doing their job. Saudi Arabia will be careful if it makes a problem in implementing a full Iranian oil boycott, I will do everything that Saudi Arabia is severely sanctioned.
4368 2018-12-07 22:13:46 Yes. The plan was to send Alberta oil to east Canada at a stable Canadian price instead of the world price & establish Canadian oil independence. This meant Alberta would not rake in the boom prices and so they opposed it. It could have been better handled. So no pipe.
4369 2018-12-07 22:13:30 Oil will save the country again
4370 2018-12-07 22:13:27 I don’t understand how Americans let these morons ruin their country. Another American told today on radio how it’s so good for Americans that oil is not more expensive than $60 per barrel... how they can now spend cheap energy. I wonder if he was talking from Camp county CA.
4371 2018-12-07 22:13:23 No butter or oil is too strong man

4373 2018-12-07 22:13:17 Oil filled heaters are a lot better than the blowy ones. Sooooo much more comfortable
4374 2018-12-07 22:13:17 We stopped using  whale oil and we can stop using coal. Outdated energy source.
4375 2018-12-07 22:12:51 Sorry u r WRONG we want YOU get get out of Number 10 as you r NO democratic Leader you sold us out So you must have a good Job lined up in the EU Just like Blair did when he want to war & got Troops killed all for MONEY/OIL

4377 2018-12-07 22:12:44 Executives work for the oil industry. I used to work for the oil industry and I can tell you a couple things, those roughnecks on platforms and rigs etc are 90'ish % hardcore Republicans and they're not giving shit to no Beto nor likely any other Democrats.
4378 2018-12-07 22:12:39 Ele tá falando de mercado global. E eu concordo, vide queda do oil
4379 2018-12-07 22:12:36 In oil producing states, where oil companies can do no wrong in the eyes of the people who provide the jobs, it's just astonishing that anyone would side with Trump over Tillerson here. After the BP oil spill those people were more likely to blame OBAMA than the oil industry!
4380 2018-12-07 22:12:35 It’s easy to be a clean tech leader when your subsidies are primarily from oil and gas transfer payments. It’s also easy to be high on ones horse when suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect.
4381 2018-12-07 22:12:35 Coconut oil will solve all your problems I promise.
Damaged hair? - coconut oil.
Dry skin? - coconut oil.
Easy makeup remover? - coconut oil.
Life stressing you out? - coconut oil.

4382 2018-12-07 22:12:19 He made it appear that Beot was accepting contributions from corporations involved in oil and gas when in fact it was EMPLOYEES who are making personal contributions. Sanders is terrified of Beto.  BS supporters spend all their time trashing Harris, O'Rourke and others.
4383 2018-12-07 22:12:18 En la siesta soñé que Antonella CORRÍA UN RAID, Mariana iba a echar gas oil para seguirla y le ponía 50 pesos. Jajajajja keeeeee

4386 2018-12-07 22:12:09 Excited about partnering with Shell Oil Company of Saraland and the great opportunities that it will create!  Chieftain PRIDE.
4387 2018-12-07 22:12:06 Rex will not get a book deal as he's an incredibly rich man.  He and Trump were oil and water personalities and Rex wouldn't submit to Trump..his new boss.
Rex was once in charge of the largest oil company, yet couldn't adapt to a new boss.. a US President.
4388 2018-12-07 22:11:58 Good.  Maybe we won't need to rely so heavily on Saudi Arabia for oil.

SANCTIONS NOW ON SAUDIS AND MOHAMMED bin SALMAN!

4389 2018-12-07 22:11:57 I have been trying the korean routine for skincare, but i always just do cleanser, toner, essence and moisturizer, and what has really help me has been using jojoba oil to melt blackheads
4390 2018-12-07 22:11:55 I believe that in life, God will give you second chances. While what he did was wrong and deserved to be fired for it, I believe he has learned from it and will be better because of it
4391 2018-12-07 22:11:38 There WERE those of us who didn’t see “God’s not done with me yet” as not the best reasoning re trying to make Trump look respectable despite zero qualifications for anything but oil deals w Russia
4392 2018-12-07 22:11:38 Hey @ReadingGPodcast, I would totally listen to an olive oil podcast hosted by Brea and Allan. 
4393 2018-12-07 22:11:32 Hey MAGA, your tRump constantly says the WH staff is a well-oiled machine, humming along efficiently and yet - every time someone leaves, there is vitriol from both sides.  Does this seem like a smooth operation to you? #WakeUp - tRUmp is a LIAR, fraud & snake oil salesman.

4403 2018-12-07 22:11:07 Great job Mark!  Thank you (even tho I’m on the other coast) - for doing this. I’ve never believed offshore oil was worth the potentially disastrous consequences, especially now there are alternative fuels available.
4404 2018-12-07 22:11:00 I could go and spoon feed you information but I’m not. So I’ll say this and let you do your own research. Pushing “green” energy and raising costs on energy produced by oil and coal will make it incredibly harder for the poor to afford it.

4412 2018-12-07 22:10:22 There sure is "social acceptance" to wallow in the $$$ western oil provides in Equalization Welfare Payments for Quebec. What frigging hypocrites. Cut of those welfare payments until they agree to participate in the transfer of oil for the benefit of the whole country.

ok.

Corn$385.25-0.06%
4418 2018-12-07 22:10:06 So how cheap would gas be if we didn’t export so much of our oil?
4419 2018-12-07 22:10:05 Malcolm sad that anybody who lived in New York knew that Trump was nothing but a snake oil Salesman con artist loser that went bankrupt multiple times and the country was fooled by this.

4421 2018-12-07 22:09:56 There is no simple fix. Americans will not stop their buying and American business owners are have supplier contracts. Oil is one commodity that is relatively cheap and in abundant supply.
4422 2018-12-07 22:09:48 Trudeau says the Premiers discussed NAFTA, internal trade barriers, ways to support the energy industry through the oil price crisis, and of course the carbon pricing plan. #cdnpoli
4423 2018-12-07 22:09:44 Oil
4424 2018-12-07 22:09:17 So this is our President in 2018 - calling one of the leading oil executives in the world “dumb as a rock” and GOP Senators and Congress sit back saying nothing smoking cigars and sipping scotch, while the executive branch humiliates itself...Quite a tone of civility!!!
4425 2018-12-07 22:09:16 sooooo ...  the guy who ran the Exxon Valdez corp that employed mercenaries, controlled world-wide gas prices, opposed greenhouse gas restrictions, misled the public on climate change, and perpetrated human rights abuses to access oil wants "American people" better informed.

Trump has committed So much criminal behavior since he started that it’s understandable that people have forgotten the early reports of the Russian/Exxon/trump collusion and offshore accounts that oil deal had
4440 2018-12-07 22:08:12 I kinda hate assembling computers but I also have this thing where once I've learned how to do something FUCK if I'm paying someone else to do it! (May make an exception when my oil change comes due in the middle of winter)

4442 2018-12-07 22:08:07 Canada oil industry is the model the rest of the world should strive to be.
4443 2018-12-07 22:07:58 My understanding from the announcement is that all oil (heavy and conventional) are being cut. So I assumed the upgrading would likewise decline a bit. If you can show evidence that upgrading will not change at all I'll recalculate.
4444 2018-12-07 22:07:58 THC don work like that. You'd ultimately end up hurting yourself. Best thing to do  is get some oil, some bud, n throw it all inna blunt

4468 2018-12-07 22:05:35 Do what you need to do to get that oil to market! All these morons replying on this thread are clearly too stupid to realize the importance of oil money. And Justin Trudeau is a spineless pm. He likes to spend the money but doesn't want to make the money. And Fuck BC...#FuckBC
4469 2018-12-07 22:05:27 Exactly. Hero my ass! Bet they think the same of his son who orchestrated 9/11 to pull us into a money war. Kill thousands of Americans to benefit your families private oil interests. Make a lie that a totally different country than you blame for 9/11 has WOMD. Kill more people

4472 2018-12-07 22:05:14 Gary how could you do this? You know its nonsense, they need Scottish oil, gas, electricity, petroleum, aviation fuel, Salmon, whisky, Science, pharmaceuticals Wood, forestry. Trident base. Water. On and on Labour trying to keep Scotland in its greedy hands to keep the UK affloat
4473 2018-12-07 22:05:09 ...industries contributions to Canada's economy. Right now, we're actually pretty worried about the oil industry's contribution to climate change and the horrible disasters that face our country and the rest of the world if we don't get a handle on that....
4474 2018-12-07 22:05:05 It's Kool Aid, but you wouldn't know that because you're a rich oil exec who has never drank Kool Aid on they're life

4477 2018-12-07 22:04:42 I wont argue that. Just the cost of getting. If oil drops below $50 a barrel it is no longer cost effective
4478 2018-12-07 22:04:40 And you guys made it  worst for PMB in 2015/16 with oil pipelines vandalized  almost 50 times by NigerDelta  Avengers even as the price of oil was declining.
Ha! These people are wicked!

4482 2018-12-07 22:04:20 Is it weird that I’m more upset that I paid for my oil change and then got into an accident? Like what if I need to change my oil again...
4483 2018-12-07 22:04:08 That bureaucrat can never keep up with Trump. He is slowed molasses and accomplished . Trump can run rings around that idiot. He can only hide as a CEO of Exon that masses up the greatest oil pollution in history by oil tanker.
4484 2018-12-07 22:04:07 You are so damn proud of being able to send carbon polluting oil products to other countries while those same countries are working 1000% harder than the US at converting to renewable energy sources. Once again this WH is so far behind the power curve that its embarrassing.
4485 2018-12-07 22:04:02 You're a dirty piece of shit anybody from in #NewYork knows what type of person u are u snake oil salesman fucking dirtbag. In New York you are nothing but a joke loser who kept on going bankrupt and the rest of the country was scammed because they didn't know about you.

- Create a homemade face mask that both exfoliates and moisturizes by mixing the juice from one lemon with 1/4 cup olive oil or sweet almond oil.
4494 2018-12-07 22:03:12 Be careful, Ms. Notley: you're becoming tiresome! Canadians are ver much aware of how and why and what your province needs to get out of the oil mess it's in. We don't need your constant reminders that we're all at fault, and that we should be grateful for the Alberta oil...
4495 2018-12-07 22:03:07 Ok, but there’s another side to the story. They do pay more, & the fact it’s because they earn more isn’t a complete answer. The $ still leaves the province via federal taxes and goes to other provinces. Then other provinces who get their money complain about their dirty oil.
4496 2018-12-07 22:02:56 The cost of living in California. 
We produce 8.3% of the oil production in this country.
We pay $0.71/gal taxes. 59% of that goes to road & bridge maintenance.

You can fry your turkey to take with ogi. 
Thank you
4500 2018-12-07 22:02:39 That would be pretty cool - a bit of a Greek mythological feel - certainly better than fighting it over bloody oil.
4501 2018-12-07 22:02:34 Rosenstien needs a smackdown for this. Really, he was allowed to fire that schmuck of snake oil salesmen Comey. Comey should have been fired on day 1. He should fire this little schmuck as well.

4510 2018-12-07 22:01:33 The RFs had a hand in medical supplies, aided in the refugee crisis and were involved in the oil industry. Lawrence of Arabia was sent to the Middle East to rally an Arab army and secure its oil fields. RFs had a hand in that. Which ever side won would have had control of that
4511 2018-12-07 22:01:22 I did one batch where I heat the oil up with the cast iron skillet in the hot oven and then pour in the batter, it sort of fries the crust BUT it spattered so much when the batter hit the oil I would NOT say it was worth it
4512 2018-12-07 22:01:20 You ran casinos into the ground. Tillerson ran a very successful oil company.

4529 2018-12-07 21:59:57 Good if the price of oil goes down too low oil companies will lay off people. We don’t want that either
4530 2018-12-07 21:59:55 I had the worst nap bc my mom rang the doorbell like a maniac as soon as I got comfily sleepy  anyway I cooked but bc I was stirring the pot impatiently I got oil burns on the corner of my mouth and it painfoo :c
4531 2018-12-07 21:59:53 In the mean time, Wall Street completely ignored this news and sold off again. supposedly over the price of oil.
4532 2018-12-07 21:59:50 Have you ever seen how much cbd oil costs ...? For 30ml here in Canada it’s over $100. So three bottles of cbd infused product is a steal.

4539 2018-12-07 21:59:09 Trump's dialed up the propaganda to 11. He's trying the best he can at discrediting Mueller. Sorry #TrashTrump, but America is not one of your shady businesses for you to use and abuse. Your snake oil salesmen days are numbered. So sad to see a president go down in flames.
4540 2018-12-07 21:59:06 ‘Let’s pretend we like oil and gas because we’ve accomplished nothing in the last 3-1/2 years and it looks like we have to get some votes for the next election.   Oh... and all this stuff costs money.  Lots of money.’
4541 2018-12-07 21:58:55 So I pull up to get my oil change and there is this couple making out in the car next to me in the parking lot . I’m waiting for them to finish up and realize that both the people are employees here  .

4562 2018-12-07 21:57:19 Its cool that Ohio finally got with the times but I have a huge issue with the way it was done.

4564 2018-12-07 21:57:14 My family went I think 15 years ago, now? 10 years after you, and the oil was still leaking out. I remember seeing the rainbow gloss it left on the surface of the ocean. The shiver that ran down my spine realizing there are likely still bodies on that ship.
4565 2018-12-07 21:57:09 That doesn't help us regular folks. We're not oil executives. What we need is for greedy oil execs to stop gouging us for gasoline.

4592 2018-12-07 21:55:15 Right. Umm there is a period where CO2 rises but temp declines. 

Sunspots seem to have a STRONG pos correlation. Energy producers have been using this info to predict how much heating oil will be needed in a season ((to decrease their storage cost)
4593 2018-12-07 21:54:58 If there was a pipeline East and after 50 years oil wasn’t required water could be sent East instead of the USA. I guess they could recycle their sewage and drink up Quebec. That concept might get them to wake up if they thought about the alternative.
4594 2018-12-07 21:54:57 This oil is too much

4598 2018-12-07 21:54:36 Eating my salad with spinach,  carrots,  kale,  broccoli, peas, ginger,  turmeric and olive oil.  I am also watching Ancient Aliens.  What a nerd I am.
4599 2018-12-07 21:54:36 rex sold his soul for oil.
4600 2018-12-07 21:54:33 Wow you’re a fccking disaster for the economy. Dow crashing and oil prices rising. You’re a hopeless Dope! You’re the worst thing ever for this country!
4601 2018-12-07 21:54:32 his lack of concern for practicality is matched only by his lack of concern of standing perilously close to steel drums full of fire whilst being soaked to the bone in oil
4602 2018-12-07 21:54:25 And the Arizona is still leaking oil...
4603 2018-12-07 21:54:12 I think it is time to re-think oil. I think it is time to make Thunder Bay and oil port. We can then ship oil by the great lakes. We already shipped iron ore, nickel, etc.
4604 2018-12-07 21:54:04 What we were discussing with my Oga an hour ago
4605 2018-12-07 21:54:00 I can't understand how anyone can still think oil is a byproduct of dinosaurs. Simple volumetric calculations easily prove this wrong.
4606 2018-12-07 21:53:58 It's hard to do that when he was, likely, making side deals for the oil companies w/poor African nations. There's hardly anybody in 45's orbit that doesn't have blood on their hands, one way or another. That how he obtain his so-called loyalty.
4607 2018-12-07 21:53:57 Such a snake oil salesman he is.......
4608 2018-12-07 21:53:55 On whose ticket? He wouldn't even get passed primaries. Imagine his answers when grilled on whether oil and gas companies must be trimmed to limit climate change. Yes means he loses all votes from the oil and gas value chain. All of it.
4609 2018-12-07 21:53:53 Se supone que mañana saldra de nuevo uno de sus productos el Green Juice. No se si sea verdad o aun no. Una duda yo me hago jugos verdes por las mañanas y le agrego el MSM y tambien el Oregano Oil. Esta bien o tiene que ser por separado.
4610 2018-12-07 21:53:47 The millions of acres of Russian oil that Trump camp was counting on. Who put him there? His good pal Vlad.
4611 2018-12-07 21:53:40 Saskatchewan would be all for joining them and taking our oil, uranium and potash with us.
4612 2018-12-07 21:53:24 How much is an oil change before I get finessed 
4613 2018-12-07 21:53:10 This isn’t funny. I am seriously worried about the world in which my grandchildren will live. 

It’s money from big oil and gas, folks. The politicians are crooked and just don’t care about us at all.
4614 2018-12-07 21:53:05 This guy I work with has a gnarly beard so I asked him jokingly if he uses beard oil. He looked at me, laughed and pulled out 7 CONTAINERS OF BEARD OIL. 
4615 2018-12-07 21:52:48 Its ironic because he uses a car thats made to be environmental friendly but bought it with money from oil that’s the opposite of environmental friendly

4619 2018-12-07 21:52:18 $20 a barrel oil again?
4620 2018-12-07 21:52:12 Right, and with the long list of toxic ingredients in most lotions, the only thing I may actually leave inside me may be coconut oil.
4621 2018-12-07 21:52:08 Came change my oil and he called and said “is that your car at your moms work” and when i said “yea” he said “figured, i saw the big ass dent in the trunk and figured it was you”
4622 2018-12-07 21:51:34 Traditional oil compamies run smart energy businesses and invest in whatever energy alternatives being pushed by govt and people.
When UN and govts demonize fossil fuel CO2, the oil companies buy other renewable industries.
4623 2018-12-07 21:51:31 I’m buying CBD oil for my dog and I just read ALL of the reviews for it....just realized I don’t even do that for myself
4624 2018-12-07 21:51:16 I’ve got tanning oil but not taking it  when do I ever sit in the sun  alcohol cures a hangover 
4625 2018-12-07 21:51:06 I don't smoke pot but there are a whole lot of Medical uses for Pot or Hemp or CBD oil from Glaucoma to parkinsons to cancer treatments and probably a whole lot more!  Its not addictive and the whole premise of its a gateway drug i think is pure BS put into peoples heads.
4626 2018-12-07 21:51:04 I have this blue dream oil pen . Smfh . Fire
4627 2018-12-07 21:50:33 That’s great for your hands! Yes but jojoba oil is very similar to the oil our body (skin particular) naturally makes. Jojoba oil is affordable (which I love!)
4628 2018-12-07 21:50:28 Collect a lot of their oil then sell it back for a profit. This country has a lot of oil still under the ground.

4632 2018-12-07 21:49:49 Dubai has no own oil and doesn’t sell oil. A little bit of homework and Internet research would be nice before posting those comments. We are all humans and we love Tesla. That’s all that counts.
4633 2018-12-07 21:49:46 The Russians because of the oil deal that was restricted due to the sanctions.

4639 2018-12-07 21:48:52 Not seasoning, but cooking with butter instead of oil (olive oil for best) and frying everything is = fat
4640 2018-12-07 21:48:39 If Rex is dumb as a rock, then why did you hire him? I thought you had all the best people. Rex was chosen by the board of directors at ExxonMobil,  the US biggest oil company, are you saying they lack judgment as well?
4641 2018-12-07 21:48:34 I remember in the 1970s when world experts told us life as we knew it was going to change forever because we were going to run out of oil. We paid dearly for that. Now here we are again going to pay for a world crisis that we don’t know is going to happen. Déjà vu
4642 2018-12-07 21:48:28 Sipping lemon balm tea  covered in lemon balm lotion and diffusing lemon balm oil. I’m the picture of calm 
4643 2018-12-07 21:48:23 Besides his consistent support for Wall Street, taking gobs of cash of from oil/gas industry, and walking back his support for Medicare for All, the hype is ridiculous.
4644 2018-12-07 21:48:20 As we discussed, I don't necessarily agree there's an ethics problem However 2 things I want to note about Phil's response that isnt mentioned & should be: 1. he's one of the biggest oil & gas lobbyists in WV; & 2. the folks left out of our citizen legislature are state employees
4645 2018-12-07 21:48:19 Steak, chorizo, jalapeño, mushroom, bbq base, chilli oil on top. Snm.
4646 2018-12-07 21:48:04 anytime any east/south-east asian food blogger talks about chili oil, I feel my mouth watering, like i want to try it so bad
4647 2018-12-07 21:47:57 I'm looking up acronyms and it's not helpful.
-Harmonica Organization of Texas
-Husbands out of town (personally I'm leaning towards this one)
-Heavy Oil Operations Technicians

Next, I'm looking up old timey secretary shorthand.
4648 2018-12-07 21:47:53 It wasn’t that long ago we were running out of oil.
4649 2018-12-07 21:47:48 My oil wasted yesterday @AshVProducts it’s time to re-up on the magic.

If all else fails, I still have my RBF

4651 2018-12-07 21:47:37 so happy i only work one job tomorrow so i can take my car to get an oil change  like i’m excited lmao

4653 2018-12-07 21:47:28 The falling price of oil is not our fault. We need to ensure that future environmental damage is mitigated and existing damage is repaired. How do you suggest we do this?
4654 2018-12-07 21:47:25 I know! I've been saying this for years. I lost friends over the years because they took the stand on what they heard on NPR. 
There was a report on the Bakken oil field reserves from way back in '98 before any government agency recognized true potential of the Williston basin.

4658 2018-12-07 21:47:08 The cancelled pipeline did not just happen. It was @liberal_party policy.

Alberta NDP are only too happy to cut production. They do not anticipate it will return (even though oil's replacement isn't even on the horizon).
4659 2018-12-07 21:47:01 I continue to believe there is more to the huge  Russia/Exxon/Mobil oil deal.

4661 2018-12-07 21:46:56 This was for the OIL DEAL when they thought the sanctions would be lifted! WRONG!
4662 2018-12-07 21:46:51 That is amazing. I used to do that. I need to take care of them more. Do you use any oil on your nails? I would recommend Jojoba oil. Rub in (day and night) onto your cuticles and nail bed. It helps with strength!
4663 2018-12-07 21:46:39 Anytime. Also Black cumin seed oil cure everything
4664 2018-12-07 21:46:34 For some reason (don't ask) I was researching lighting last night. So, medieval townsfolk couldn't actually afford candles! They burned fat, or oil. Wax candles were a day's wage each and for rich households only. Something to keep in mind for your next tavern or night scene.
4665 2018-12-07 21:46:27 Heading back to the oil field.
4666 2018-12-07 21:46:23 Maybe this is why Tillerson was saying to Trump something Trump wanted wasn't legal. Maybe it's got to do with UN rules? Maybe taking over oil fields would be illegal according to Tillerson?
4667 2018-12-07 21:46:19 Plus all the oil, grease, etc. does make it dicey if no rain for a stretch.
4668 2018-12-07 21:46:14 Youre not a capitalist, or a conservative, if you believe we should just stick with the 75% state-owned oil cartel run by Islamists with nine wives who fund terrorism for laughs, because innovation and the free market is not capable of producing new vehicle types
4669 2018-12-07 21:46:08 She's got it in her. Oil unending.

4671 2018-12-07 21:46:05 I use CBD oil which has the thc removed. It really has impressed me with my arthritis and fibromyalgia pain. I am drug resistant this works better than opioids. I think marijuana is a gateway drug. THC dulls the mind CBD works without it.I am not for legalizing it.
4672 2018-12-07 21:46:05 Try castor oil, hair oil, yet decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?
4673 2018-12-07 21:46:05 This woman is an embarrassment.
4674 2018-12-07 21:46:01 Yeah I clean up on oil changes too, but don't even want the bottled water if I need major service.  I be serious and tight af. Lol
4675 2018-12-07 21:45:58 But @MySwilly I can't remember what everyone said.  I think I dosed my CBD a bit too high this afternoon.  You should give @charlottesweb a try some day. Best product in the #CBD oil industry.
4676 2018-12-07 21:45:51 Trump did it again.

Yes but Putin gave him a medal of Honor when he was USA's top oil exec?
Not a nice thing thing to say about a cool dude. why not then just say nothing?
4677 2018-12-07 21:45:47 There’s a 0% chance Trump knows where oil comes from, except Saudi Arabia.

4692 2018-12-07 21:44:41 So, the US govt confirms that USA is now a net exporter of oil.  Feel sorry for many who argued with me over Iraq war after rading few stories on BBC. Just goes on to show how USA made fool out of these uneducated "woke" humans.

4704 2018-12-07 21:43:58 Quebec wasn't defeated on the Plains of Abraham, only the French army. And if we're going to rehash history, for a quarter century all Canadians paid twice the world price for oil to keep AB's oil sector afloat - Canadians help one another out!

4710 2018-12-07 21:43:28 DJT is so terrible he managed to disgust an Oil Baron with his unethical requests and stupidity. We live in a world now where Oil Executives are not the cartoon bad guy and the President is. I hate this timeline.

4715 2018-12-07 21:43:06 Depends on who is going to be using it (& the size of the bags), but a few suggestions: 
Chocolates. Scented tealights. Bottles of essential oil. Miniatures of alcohol.  Mini bath bomb. Mini soap. Nuts. Chocolate coins. Lip balm. Key ring. Gift card for coffee shop, etc.
4716 2018-12-07 21:43:06 What do you guys think Naval Supremacy soap smells like? Oil, gunpowder, the ocean breeze, and the screams of the damned 20,000 leagues below the sea?

4720 2018-12-07 21:42:49 Just discovered Earl Grey has the oil of orange rinds added to it. Also just discovered that it's my favourite kind of tea.
4721 2018-12-07 21:42:44 @realDonaldTrump Believe me if I can, I can do it, I have enough power to do this. The world should be ready for a full boycott of Iranian oil
4722 2018-12-07 21:42:41 Which situation? Having an industry that’s dependent on pipelines? Like every other oil/gas nation in the world?
4723 2018-12-07 21:42:21 The don't. They do  not comprehend how to read the information about his donations. They think people who work for the oil industry is the industry itself, and not those who work for the industry. So now, even workers are bad to them. But, would be good if it were Sanders.
4724 2018-12-07 21:42:20 Lmao. Yea I changed my front brakes, not my back ones are squealing  I’m over it and I need to change my oil. Fun weekend ahead for me....

4727 2018-12-07 21:42:04 #whatcanadaloses are the millionsof dollars in propaganda advertising on tv and internet that #Alberta is using promote a pipeline that is not in the best interest of Canada’s future. You’re creating a great divide and oil lobbyists are pulling the strings. #cdnpoli

4729 2018-12-07 21:41:58 I see that the latest propaganda initiative from oil industry/Alta govt is the hashtag #WhatCanadaLoses This whole "price differential" spin just seems nonsensical, though.  Does the bitumen that *already* gets piped to the coast sell to Asia at a premium price? Of course not!
4730 2018-12-07 21:41:54 But why should we protect Chinas oil supply? They are laughing at us

4732 2018-12-07 21:41:52 I only know this cause of my old job. I had no idea the regional differences in energy/heating/water supply.  We had properties that were on wells, oil, propane, Wood heat etc
4733 2018-12-07 21:41:18 And it's he worst idea to sell own oil when still be dependent on foreign oil.
4734 2018-12-07 21:41:10 Rad! Mine is a plug-in one, so really light, but it's fairly weak. But I don't have to deal with oil and smoke and noise.

4743 2018-12-07 21:40:33 Respectfully, Canada can’t handle this. And if we have the resources in our own country how do we account for 10 million a day being paid for Saudi Oil. They don’t make transfer payments. Transfer patents build schools, hospitals, roads, etc all over his country.

4766 2018-12-07 21:39:26 Yours do.

For all their cost, renewables today put out less than 0.5% of the world's energy.

Windfarms are already failing for lack of the extreme maintenance they require.

Not to mention the vast quantities of coal and oil (and concrete) they require to even build.
4767 2018-12-07 21:39:25 As you can see in the article, they cheated a little in recent years. But in theory, the oil fund is something they keep separate from their State budget.

4773 2018-12-07 21:38:52 I Don’t know why it’s so hard for some Canadians and Americans to understand that if we’re gonna reduce how much oil we produce that renewable energy is going to replace that with more jobs that will need many different types of trades. It’s that simple #CanadianEnergy

4796 2018-12-07 21:37:21 Puzzling how some oil "expert" personnel & even Pres. Trump state that it costs $30, $40, & $50 to produce a barrel of oil by Arabian countries.  Huh?! As far as I know, it costs less than $10 per barrel of oil.  Even if oil dropped to $20/barrel, they'd make 100%+ profit! Dang!
4797 2018-12-07 21:37:16 it’s a bmw, if he took it to a bmw dealer thats why its so high, it costs like 200 for an oil change at dealers
4798 2018-12-07 21:37:13 During campaign Trump said if US had to keep going to war he'd take over oil fields to pay for it.   Maybe Trump was asking Tillerson about this & Tillerson didn't agree? Tillerson mentioned Trump wanted to do something & Tillerson said it wasn't legal. I'm not sure?

4869 2018-12-07 21:31:15 Yep that's what i'm after, been scalping crude oil today using the fibs & ema's, but want to get really good at it.
4870 2018-12-07 21:31:05 who knew the oil CEO would be the one with a fucking conscience
4871 2018-12-07 21:30:50 there’s this guy from a belgian fraternity who died bc he had to drink 3 liters of fish oil wtf.. i’m literally so disgusted this is horrible
4872 2018-12-07 21:30:50 I visited last year. Can’t get over how oil still rises from the USS Arizona. Fascinating reminder.

4874 2018-12-07 21:30:35 It's time to play hardball with Quebec, for years they have blocked oil flowing east & have also blocked Newfoundland hydro flowing west. 
Lead, follow, or get out of the GD way!
4875 2018-12-07 21:30:34 Never trust an oil man.  Environmentalists have been saying that for years.
4876 2018-12-07 21:30:21 There's more oil & gas under the ground all over the conterminous USA than anyone will dare admit
4877 2018-12-07 21:30:17 So basically, everything Rex Tillerson, a distinguished CEO of the largest Oil company said is TRUE.  You are lazy, fat, don't read, think you know it all and basically a LOSER. Lazy, is spending taxpayer $ to be a golf course every weekend and deficits like your bankrupt company

4879 2018-12-07 21:30:10 In your graph it looks like fossil power generation (coal+gas+oil) is not much higher than it was before Fukushima. I assume that Other is mostly renewables?

4883 2018-12-07 21:29:52 Growing up with a big family fried food was eaten as it finished. Everyone crowded in the kitchen eating food as it came out of the pot of oil. Kids dredged, Mom and Dad put food in the fryer and took them out, youngest added salt. Everyone got crispy hot food.
4884 2018-12-07 21:29:42 His, or Vlad's handpicked SOS? Maybe Vlad wanted him because he knew he could do business(gas & oil) with Rex First thing Trump sent him to Moscow to talk about was sanction relief.
4885 2018-12-07 21:29:41 Starting to see good news get sold off a couple of examples:

Trump tweet China Trade talks doing good - Market doesn't care

Oil Prices go higher- Oil Stocks don't care

4902 2018-12-07 21:28:23 Oil prices jumped as Russia and the major Middle East producers in OPEC edged closer to an agreement to reduce output to try to drain inventories and support the market
4903 2018-12-07 21:28:18 Wow OPEC wants to cut oil production in January
  Make more $$$ and guess what r prices going up up up.  Always when theres a Republican president gas has to be expensive.  I hate it
Time to move on from crude oil

4909 2018-12-07 21:27:36 No, no it isn’t. Counter balance to Iran. Not everything is about oil.
4910 2018-12-07 21:27:34 Here in my area of Ohio,WVa, and Pa is a bed of oil bigger than lake Erie. There's also Marsellis Shale and Utica. In my township alone there will be 30 Well Pads.  My 15.98 acres is in the pool for Well Pad #26 
4911 2018-12-07 21:27:34 I’m glad I’m not a horse, because the smell of burnt oil on four would be strong enough to choke me if I was.

4913 2018-12-07 21:27:31 The guy's worried about marine traffic ratio to oil spills.?
Also, is protecting BC waters more complex than the level of current protections in place for waters that now RECEIVE oil tanker traffic (East)?
Does PhD boy think its more responsible to be shipping by rail ?

4922 2018-12-07 21:26:29 Trump’s worried about what Tillerson knows about lifting sanctions to get at the Russian oil. He’s trying to destroy Tillerson’s reputation & degrade his character before the truth comes out.

4931 2018-12-07 21:25:46 OPEC cut 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. I wonder how this will affect the markets. Was there a shift today?
4932 2018-12-07 21:25:43 UK blue chips were ahead in late afternoon trading helped by a jump in crude oil prices and a sense that yesterday’s sell off, the largest in over 2 years, had been too indiscriminate

4934 2018-12-07 21:25:19 2/2 Unlike you he was a REAL CEO who had to answer to board members & share holders. Working for one of the largest oil &gas companies shows he was smart and good at his job. Why do you always attack people who tell the truth. You are becoming the fake news!!

4942 2018-12-07 21:24:42 Said differently, every man, woman and child in Norway have 200,000$ invested in the stock market via the oil fund. This isn't the socialist redistributive system of Venezuela. They don't take it and blow it away on welfare programs. They invest it and profit 130 billion.
4943 2018-12-07 21:24:36 @cathmckenna The way you are going is losing jobs and tanking the economy.
Keep our oil industry strong and incentivise less emissions and "greener" energies then we could be the model to the world.
You are just to blind to see it.!
4944 2018-12-07 21:24:35 The CBD oil is supposedly a game changer for some illnesses
4945 2018-12-07 21:24:35 And for the environmentalists out there, foreign oil allows people to imagine that the extraction and transport of the product has no downsides. If all gas in Canada was Alberta oil, it might help people realize that it is the use, not its production that drives the process.
4946 2018-12-07 21:24:33 Going to be funny to watch liberals protecting Rex Tillerson, who not even 2 years ago they hated because he was  Big Oil Public Enemy Number One

4949 2018-12-07 21:24:21 As for 'net beneficiary', as well as the fish and agriculture, Scotland is a significant energy producer. Not only oil and gas, but renewables. Scotland has a quater of the EU's - not the UK, the *EU's* tidal energy potential.

4962 2018-12-07 21:23:02 There was little oil left. The 'owners' were the extracting companies which paid tax on their profits.

4978 2018-12-07 21:21:34 this is true but not for the reasons you think. the fact is Obama's energy policies (esp 2nd term) were almost indistinguishable from what the oil and gas sector wanted, they quibble a lot over regulatory issues but overall Obama promoted O&G to their huge benefit during his term

5003 2018-12-07 21:19:05 Oil rig mayhem in Just cause 3 was so much fun #freecodefridaycontest
5004 2018-12-07 21:19:03 but i dont have any olive oil
5005 2018-12-07 21:19:00 I am not a big fan of Oil Company COE's in General, BUT I know which one of those two I'd bet on if they were on Jeopardy. Or even solving the puzzles at the back of Highlights Magazine.
5006 2018-12-07 21:18:59 These people should not be allowed to teach others anything plain and simple!  The sky is green and water is thicker than oil!  It’s so easy to just say the opposite on every subject.
5007 2018-12-07 21:18:56 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
5008 2018-12-07 21:18:52 1/ There is no US Embassy in Syria
2/ US bombs every country that has oil unless they agree to sell out their people & worship the US$
3/ There is evidence that Western-backed terrorists gas people/behead people/kidnap people/rape/kill children & soon everyone will know the truth

5011 2018-12-07 21:18:23 You must retract logistical ukuleles and improve NGOs to advance anthropogenic oil reserves. Sign our petition.
5012 2018-12-07 21:18:19 The first episode was all about fat, namely olive oil and pork fat.  Drool worthy food and travel porn!
5013 2018-12-07 21:18:03 Bread and red oil
5014 2018-12-07 21:18:03 おはようございますー！！！！
5015 2018-12-07 21:17:56 Sounds good.  I assume any recipe that you call for that uses coconut oil was tested with refined, but if it wants the coconut flavor and aroma of Virgin, that it should not unbalance said recipe? (I know your Snickerdoodles mention both and have a variation that wants virgin)
5016 2018-12-07 21:17:45 Coco butter, aloe vera, vitamin E oil, they work great.
5017 2018-12-07 21:17:45 If u keep going zaa chanza ma suna
5018 2018-12-07 21:17:43 Its my weak point 
5019 2018-12-07 21:17:40 Yeah, stupid lazy people don't usually get to be CEO of a major oil corporation, that is reserved for family businesses, like TRUMP.
5020 2018-12-07 21:17:38 Bouta go get this dumb ass oil change
5021 2018-12-07 21:17:38 Yeee and get some witch hazel and tea tree oil if you find some
5022 2018-12-07 21:17:31 You can definitely put diluted tea tree oil on your face but they also say if you have a reaction then stop using it. People just need to read
5023 2018-12-07 21:17:29 It’s the fat which gets separated from the protein, you can call it oil I guess. Tbh i find it gross but this “oil” gives that “cheesy” taste to cheese, without it the protein alone will taste bad af.
5024 2018-12-07 21:17:27 Plus when you are sick like this, you eventually lose all your friends. I use RSO (Rick Simpson oil) and eatable marijuana. I too do not like smoking and it makes it easy to take w/o stinking up the place wherever you are. W/o this option I would have already been dead.
5025 2018-12-07 21:17:23 So basically everyone stop what your doing and farm the land because we pretty much need oil for everything. Straw houses and horse back riding it is. And average life exspectancy back down to 30yrs each lol
5026 2018-12-07 21:17:18 Has the PM of Norway threatened to cut our oil supply off yet....?
5027 2018-12-07 21:17:17 Anyone who knows anything about the corporate world esp. oil majors such as Exxon, is that it is impossible to reach executive level, let alone CEO unless you are very, very smart & disciplined. Rex Tillerson may be many things, but he isn’t dumb, but you are @realDonaldTrump
5028 2018-12-07 21:17:16 How much should an oil change be ?
5029 2018-12-07 21:17:10 No, they'll just talk about how wealthy Big Oil ex-CEO Tillerson is.
5030 2018-12-07 21:17:08 Putin chose Rex for you. The Rosneft oil deal if sanctions were ever lifted.
5031 2018-12-07 21:17:03 Are you kidding? Trudeau is the best asset of the powerfull oil lobby. None has done better than him to invest public money in the oil industry.
5032 2018-12-07 21:16:54 Hamlin's Wizard Oil was made with 50%-70% alcohol containing camphor, ammonia, chloroform, sassafras, cloves, and turpentine, and was said to be usable both internally and topically. That label version is rare.
5033 2018-12-07 21:16:54 REX TILERSON WELCOME TO THE RESISTANCE TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT AND LET US OIL YOU UP RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT IN 2020 WHICH AVENGER WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ANT-MAN HE'S NOT TAKEN

5036 2018-12-07 21:16:39 @LushOxfordSt do you guys sell the Lord of Misrule body oil? Coming from Ireland next weekend was hoping to pick it up 
5037 2018-12-07 21:16:38 stock prices tumble  oil prices surge,  is trump taking credit.
5038 2018-12-07 21:16:28 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
5039 2018-12-07 21:16:27 Oil business seem toxin.
5040 2018-12-07 21:16:17 Then the cafe broke out into spontaneous chants of  “Third Way!  Third Way!” “Electability!  Electability!” and 
“Beto 2020!” followed by 
“Guarantee access to high quality healthcare for all!” and finally, 
“The choice between oil and gas and renewable resources is a false one!”
5041 2018-12-07 21:16:07 FedEx delivered a package this morning meant to go three houses down. So not only did they get my hopes up that my oil was here but now I gotta put on outside clothes and walk down with it to the actual recipient.

5044 2018-12-07 21:15:54 @realDonaldTrump Iran's oil exports should reach zero by April, I'm not short. If oil prices reach $ 100, Iran's oil needs to be cut off by April. We must call out loudly that you can not stand against the Iranian people, our will is ferocious and we never give up
5045 2018-12-07 21:15:47 @FedExHelp  I am trying to figure out how to arrange a pickup of a generator at a residence in Oregon, to have it delivered to my house. Payment via my  FedEx account. What are the rules? (fuel and oil drained? In some kind of box?).
5046 2018-12-07 21:15:42 Yet, at the same time importing foreign oil from countries who’s human rights, gender equality & environment standards are not with keeping of Canada’s standard!!! AB needs to honestly stop equalization & sending oil & NG to these provinces. AB is Canada’s punching bag
5047 2018-12-07 21:15:40 This oil price has nothing to do with the economy. It’s opec and issues with the Saudis manipulating prices. It’s about to go back up. Way up
5048 2018-12-07 21:15:40 How does not adding the e make it less fucked up or they can't even be literate enough to make a proper slur :/
5049 2018-12-07 21:15:31 Incase y’all are wondering I am still waiting as my oil gets changed
5050 2018-12-07 21:15:27 Given all the crap that Alberta's been through in the past ten years - credit crisis in 2008, multiple oil crashes, a Fed government that hates us, massive job and capex losses, high real estate inventory levels, and more, then if we're not at the bottom we'll never get there.
5051 2018-12-07 21:15:24 If you cook the chips in the fish frying oil, it will taste like fish. Boo! Are you making your own chips or buying frozen?
5052 2018-12-07 21:15:23 Generally speaking, you can use oil to replace butter if the butter in the cake is melted. But if the butter is creamed with sugar, liquid oils do not make a good replacement. On those occasions, refined coconut oil may be a safer choice, because it is solid at room temp.
5053 2018-12-07 21:15:08 shale ain't super cool either. there's a reason why US still imports some oil.

5058 2018-12-07 21:14:50 Salmonds argument for independence was based on oil. "We are Norway, Singapore" etc. Bullshit. Oil revenues in Scotland are taxes paid by international companies. Oil price slump=£16bn tax rev to virtually zero. If ref had voted independence the country would now be skint.

5064 2018-12-07 21:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
5065 2018-12-07 21:14:31 The real reason for Qatar's exit from OPEC
Official Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the reason is to market Iran's oil to Europe and other countries to circumvent US sanctions and ensure there is financial liquidity to support the militias of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen

5067 2018-12-07 21:13:53 Ooh boy, you gotta love your car just as much as you love the gym life lol but I got all the stuff for an oil change at my house if you ever need it lol
5068 2018-12-07 21:13:49 What about oil and natural gas subsidies?
5069 2018-12-07 21:13:46 2018 YEAR END BLOW OUT SALE!

Purchase any of our 2018 Qashqais, Rogues, Muranos, or Pathfinders and receive the choice of cash back, 5 years of oil changes, or a winter tire package!
5070 2018-12-07 21:13:42 Gas would be $20/gallon if oil companies had to pay for their own armies.
5071 2018-12-07 21:13:32 Or we can adopt them now. 
There is lots of lead available too, but we collectively decided we should stop adding it our gas. 
Disrupt who? oil companies? Why care about a large corporation that cares nothing for the masses?
Why not push the tech that will benefit everyone?
5072 2018-12-07 21:13:29 Maybe the oil business will quit trying to get into the Soviet Union (Russia) with their drilling rigs and tech answer helps.
5073 2018-12-07 21:13:21 Why do you get to dictate oil production and drive the price up across Canada.  Oil is not the only item that drives your economy. Be smart and think outside the box.
5074 2018-12-07 21:13:16 おはようございます
5075 2018-12-07 21:13:16 It's real. Kind of amusing of him to unload on Tillerson like that as both Tillerson and Pompeo enabled corruption and dictators while serving as tools of the oil and gas industry.
5076 2018-12-07 21:13:13 Yes.. Oil is sell for 40 $slowly, but its seriously crazy to trade
5077 2018-12-07 21:13:08 This is why Trump was put in office, because it’s too overt for a Dem prez to get away with this. Trump admin taking it to next level after Dems did their part of gradually making US No. 1 in oil production & expanding fracking globally. If you see a pattern here you’re woke.
5078 2018-12-07 21:12:59 Lol. ... You too ripe to fry coz you gon soak the oil , I'll have you in my porridge 
5079 2018-12-07 21:12:58 He was way more powerful than even Trump’s dreams! I was in the oil industry where he was was venerated. Sad what he did to his legacy. Now he’s just the brunt of playground insults hurled by an idiot!
5080 2018-12-07 21:12:54 I don’t use Letterboxd, in lieu of that what I do is I pour a few quarts of vegetable oil into a big stew pot, get it really boiling, and then pour it all over my balls.
5081 2018-12-07 21:12:49 My handicapped cousin could have done as well with Exxon.  It’s oil for god sake.. Drill it, pump it, ship it, sell it.  You act like it’s complicated to get profits from gold sitting under some dirt!!!
5082 2018-12-07 21:12:32 Tillerson was only there to facilitate the end of sanctions with Russia so an Exxon/Russia consortium could exploit arctic oil. Once congress voted almost unanimously to bolster sanctions, Rex didn’t have much to do
5083 2018-12-07 21:12:30 Yeah because that's how you become head of a huge oil company!

5087 2018-12-07 21:12:21 Probably a case involving Standard Oil or a modern cryptocurrency outfit.  The BitConnect class action suit is gonna be worthy of keeping an eye on.
5088 2018-12-07 21:12:09 Mr President, you are at 50% approval, he is big oil.  He will condemn you incessantly.  So whst.  Let it go.  Let me be the first to recommend to pick your battles.  The country is settling in with you.  24/7 news bias has become numb to the ear.
5089 2018-12-07 21:12:02 I'm also excited to see leftists go all in on defending former top oil executive, Rex Tillerson, Destroyer of Earth.
5090 2018-12-07 21:12:01 Means the Lord has given ur home oil and it won't quench..Amen
5091 2018-12-07 21:11:57 I remember when we were told the world would run completely out of oil by 1985; not one drop would remain. Jimmy Carter sat in a darkened WH at Christmas in a sweater to set an example of how we should all live.
5092 2018-12-07 21:11:48 Little oil goes a long way!
5093 2018-12-07 21:11:44 It tastes like oil paint, the salad

5097 2018-12-07 21:11:17 Oil will be in high demand for 50-70 years globally. For Canada to lose that and become a country with a lower standard of living is ludicrous and unacceptable!
5098 2018-12-07 21:11:17 That could backfire. Quebecers might not mind so much that Alberta's oil businesses are losing lots and lots of money.
5099 2018-12-07 21:11:17 “They have as much oil as we do...”

“We”? #Appropriation
5100 2018-12-07 21:11:03 Rex was a well trusted CEO of a worldwide operating Oil and gas company until you ask him to join your fake cabinet. Same will happen with John Kelly. The USA didn't have fake news unril they got a fake President.
5101 2018-12-07 21:11:03 alaska wants to suced from the US because in 1959 we were voted into the states and not everyone was happy with that choice. we have oil and our economy could thrive as a country of its own. via @kristianalilly_
5102 2018-12-07 21:10:58 Why spend US tax dollars so that EU and China can easily buy oil from the middle east?
5103 2018-12-07 21:10:34 Where can I find a weed oil pen
5104 2018-12-07 21:10:30 So nothing changed from the oil and gas ‘discussion’, what a waste of time
5105 2018-12-07 21:10:27 The stock market would have dropped more on Friday if it weren't for a rally in the energy sector. Oil stocks like EOG Resources & Anadarko Petroleum were bid higher after OPEC & its allies reached a deal to significantly cut production. US oil prices closed 2% higher on the news

5107 2018-12-07 21:10:22 Cheaper to buy oil from Canada, Thank You Trudeau for $10-$15 barrel an oil.
5108 2018-12-07 21:10:17 Broke a satellite that fell into 2 helicopters, one of the helicopters hit an oil tanker and caused a chain reaction. The other landed on me. #freecodefridaycontest
5109 2018-12-07 21:10:15 And sub par jobs reports.  And oil price increases.
5110 2018-12-07 21:10:15 I attached a truck to a plane in Just Cause 3 and it crashed into an oil container. It was magical! #FreeCodeFridayContest
5111 2018-12-07 21:10:06 It did solar and wind on a good day accounts for 13%today according to the ieso website less than that.  Nuclear   is 35%, gas/oil 28% and hydro 23% plus biofuel 1%.

My kids loved something we called frog eyes and worms. Basically garlic with butter (or Olive oil) tossed with spaghetti and steamed peas.  They are in their 30s now and still remember it fondly.
5118 2018-12-07 21:09:38 Honestly made Premium Hemp Oil
5119 2018-12-07 21:09:30 Rubbish. Venezuela is nothing like the UK. Chavez is still revered for his reforms. The country failed not because of socialism but because of corruption & the steep drop in oil prices.
5120 2018-12-07 21:09:29 We need to leave that poison in the ground. Go 100% electric vehicles by 2040. Burning oil is killing the planet DA
5121 2018-12-07 21:09:21 Everything they own made with or because of oil.
5122 2018-12-07 21:09:14 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
5123 2018-12-07 21:09:11 Why should Canada uphold double standards and then import oil from those that have none? You’re suggesting oil tankers from Saudi Arabia have low GHG and no impact? UBC study showed our ferries had impact on whales not low noise new tankers lol.
5124 2018-12-07 21:09:06 I was being sarcastic, my point was it is not about oil at all.
5125 2018-12-07 21:09:04 I applaud you for that, he's not a progressive he's a centist. I love Obama but we don't need a Obama lite to beat trump and besides he take money for oil companies, he will not support the green new deal and Medicare for all bill
5126 2018-12-07 21:09:03 That's my point. They can do as they please and we'll still buy their oil and still sell the guns.

They can do whatever they want and people will ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ because of gas prices.
5127 2018-12-07 21:09:02 I've had three of these. I had seal oil, technically. Beluga blubber. And moose stew.

5138 2018-12-07 21:08:10 You’re just angry because Rex didn’t go along with your Treasonous plan to remove Russia’s sanctions so Exxon could drill for oil in western Siberia.  Your only goal was to line your pockets with kickbacks.  Oh, you thought you were fooling everyone when you selected Rex? Sad!!
5139 2018-12-07 21:08:10 Just tryna get my damn oil changed & go home 
5140 2018-12-07 21:08:07 Gulf Arab oil sheiks like MBS are prob on suicide watch right now as they realize their dreams of ruling the market will fail
5141 2018-12-07 21:08:06 バスタ超宿ついた。
5142 2018-12-07 21:08:02 I literally don’t have one??? Which is weird, I just wash my face with warm water whenever I can and when I feel a layer of oil starting to form (usually during work) I get a damp cloth and pat it off. I try to drink a decent amount of water too and refrain from touching my face
5143 2018-12-07 21:07:58 I never thougt I’d see the day when I admire an oil company executive.  Well, here we are!  Compared to the Dope-in-Chief, Tillerson is Einstein, Gandhi, and King Solomon all rolled into one.
5144 2018-12-07 21:07:53 Do y'all realize where the CBD oil industry is headed? You are missing out if you aren't sharing CBD with your friends and family!
5145 2018-12-07 21:07:50 Nothing says fun like waiting for an oil change and car inspection,  at least there's free coffee
5146 2018-12-07 21:07:50 
5147 2018-12-07 21:07:45 I heard niggas who smoke and don’t drink water taste like dumpster oil
5148 2018-12-07 21:07:44 I couldn't help myself. I laughed right out loud at this! So preposterous as to be ridiculous. Rex Tillerson was CEO of the largest, most successful oil company in the country! Dumb as a rock? Really? Everyone knows you are green with envy. C'mon man...show some respect.
5149 2018-12-07 21:07:41 You would hope so. Unfortunately we continue to see such wasted energy (no pun intended) on talking to oil majors hoping they'll change direction. Efforts like those by @NYSComptroller to engage Exxon. The smarter money is getting out of fossil fuels. Even through Norwegians
5150 2018-12-07 21:07:39 I don't want to be divisive, but I am sick and f****** tired of Alberta and their pipelines! Evolve already! 
So righteous when they're floating in oil money and the big is f****** whiners when it crashes.
5151 2018-12-07 21:07:37 Oil up, stocks down, Trump sideways.
5152 2018-12-07 21:07:29 How much oil does he need for the eggs??? #imaceleb
5153 2018-12-07 21:07:28 Hannity compares birth of Christ to oil tycoons getting rich. How Christian.
5154 2018-12-07 21:07:27 Medicinal yes ... definitely the oil ...needs to be legal.
5155 2018-12-07 21:07:25 I've drank it ONCE in the U.S. It's like motor oil...not close to the same product. North of the border it's great!
5156 2018-12-07 21:07:24 Anyone stupid enough to align himself with this snake oil con man deserves every humiliation he or she subsequently gets.
5157 2018-12-07 21:07:18 Girl you had me at truffle oil! That is one of my favorite things to cook with...and a little goes a long way!!!
5158 2018-12-07 21:07:16 Oil up, $HAL down.  

Imagine we have some chapter-22s coming in smaller cap OFS
5159 2018-12-07 21:07:16 Don't believe her smokescreen bull for a minute. Anti oil and gas advocates in her government. Carbon tax enforcer. Walk to work she tells us. What f'n work? She knows elections coming soon. Vote this ass hat out!
5160 2018-12-07 21:07:05 Tbh idk what I did but I took that oil out and I was on one, but thank u I’ll use this for future reference 
5161 2018-12-07 21:06:46 I can't wait to have kids and give them castor oil
5162 2018-12-07 21:06:39 Legault for his part pushed exporting more of Quebec's hydroelectricity to other provinces. It's "clean energy" compared to "dirty" oil from Alberta, he said. #canpol #cdnpoli
5163 2018-12-07 21:06:31 Following everyone except @subschneider, who blocked me. 
5164 2018-12-07 21:06:29 “Net” means were still buying 7 mil b/d of crude oil from countries that hate our way of life and kill our troops.

Amen for electric cars
5165 2018-12-07 21:06:23 Screw Tillerson, he was chosen because of the 500 billion dollar oil deal in the tundra involving Russia.  #FuckTrump They were looking at Romney and Russia nixed it for Tillerson.  #fuckcorporateamerica
5166 2018-12-07 21:06:22 You hired him. You praised him. Which you do we believe? "He's a world-class player. He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of its next nearest competitor." DJT 12/16
5167 2018-12-07 21:06:15 Tell me which essential oil gets people to stop talking to me.
5168 2018-12-07 21:06:09 Thanks Karl. The sight of Barrington   makes me angry...I saw a clip of Only Fools & I remembered how similar 'Boycee'?? Looks & his character ie..snake oil salesman, to Jimbo Barrington! 
5169 2018-12-07 21:06:08 2. good enough. The most oil/ gas production of any president in history, got rid of habeas corpus for US citizens accused of terrorism, brought extra judicial assassinations back to US policy, deported the most people of any president, put US born children into foster care after
5170 2018-12-07 21:06:08 That I don't know. I have my own money on the line shorting oil.
5171 2018-12-07 21:06:04 So he had the mental capacity to run one of The World's largest oil companies ( extremely well ) for 10 years but not enough to serve under Orange Hitler?   Got it!
5172 2018-12-07 21:05:53 ตีสี่ทำไมฝนตก งง555
5173 2018-12-07 21:05:45 It’s not about oil. It’s about having the biggest regional power on America’s side as a counter against Iran/Russia/China. Think bigger, geopolitics isn’t just oil.
5174 2018-12-07 21:05:37 Cocoa butter, bio oil, aloe Vera. Aloe Vera for me is the best but either of the others should work 
5175 2018-12-07 21:05:31 magnesium glycinate is great, but magnesium oil works amazingly too! Well said doc
5176 2018-12-07 21:05:25 Or the classic blood eagle? Boiling oil is also an option
5177 2018-12-07 21:05:24 We export oil. EU is dependent on middle east. China is. Not us
5178 2018-12-07 21:05:20 If Trump tries to safely test where to drill for oil he is BAD because oil is BAD but if Trump tries to eliminate oil use he is BAD because those are JOBS for GOOD PEOPLE
5179 2018-12-07 21:05:19 You should REALLY look at what policies Trump has supported and who he’s appointed.

It’s been a nonstop corruption train fueled by hatred.

He wants to build literal concentration camps.

He appoints oil execs to cabinet positions.

Tried to ban trans people in the military.
5180 2018-12-07 21:05:09 If ya driving all the way from New Bedford/Dartmouth to Seekonk for Chic Fil A please go to Lemon and Oil instead..trust me
5181 2018-12-07 21:05:08 Get yourself some beard oil b.  Your whole style is stuck in 2000.
5182 2018-12-07 21:05:03 evil, but brilliant (oil gonna kill us)
5183 2018-12-07 21:05:03 Gee, if only we could buy oil from Iran, or if Iran wasn't under sanctions again.
5184 2018-12-07 21:05:01 ok tesco free from coconut oil mozzarella tastes like feet so...that’s good to know
5185 2018-12-07 21:04:59 I read an article yesterday about it, it was so detailed about the bill and it's clarity, billahil Azeem there's an ulterior motive and many lines contravene.
I wish I could dig out d link fr u
5186 2018-12-07 21:04:50 Silk plus oil = disaster
5187 2018-12-07 21:04:50 You won't get paid. Because you don't matter. Not to oil companies. Not to Tammy. Not to Fox. Not to Trump. Enjoy shilling for nothing, little boy.
5188 2018-12-07 21:04:44 @cancer cannibas oil is and so is gcmaf a much better cure than chemo or radio therapy could ever be. Big pharma would disagree because money comes before people where they are concerned
5189 2018-12-07 21:04:37 Rex had his own evil. You thought you'd tap into it. An oilman that was all tank, no oil? You hired him. You fired him. Whatyoumean 'couldn't get rid of him fast enough?' -Who was in charge? He gutted the State Department as you ordered. I wouldn't call that lazy, sir. Now a game
5190 2018-12-07 21:04:35 We can either start moving away from coal and oil now.  Or be forced to due to supply or geopolitical problems later.  And "Green" infrastructure doesn't appear overnight.  You don't have to believe climatologist to see value in more well paying jobs and true energy independence.
5191 2018-12-07 21:04:31 A chance that oil exists. What would our elected officials do without limousines and planes to waste our money around the world @JustinTrudeau @francoislegault @MaximeBernier @AndrewScheer
5192 2018-12-07 21:04:31 I am craving an #allnatural #facemask. At the grocery store now to purchase some #cucumbers, #cocoa, #avocados and #coconut oil, all #organic of course!
5193 2018-12-07 21:04:28 When an oil executive is the conscience of a nation
5194 2018-12-07 21:04:28 #whetherspoons #ClimateChange #bbcaq Whetherspoons Beery Brexiteer boss says he's confused by arguments on climate change. Listens to oil funded befuddled arch Brexiteer and French resident Nigel Lawson! Whetherspoons provides simple answers for drunks - not scientists!
5195 2018-12-07 21:04:21 How or why would EXXON have a Sloth like Rex Tillerson as CEO? Why would such a brilliant but yet not a billionaire work for a guy he hates? Why is Trump worth billions and Tillerson checks Trump's oil?
5196 2018-12-07 21:04:15 Oil: OPEC reached deal to cut 1.2m bpd supply, more than expected. Delegates said 800k barrels will come from OPEC and additional 400k from allies. Iran exempt from making any cuts. Crude rose 5% post-announcement
Oil RUB (+/v), INR (-/v)
5197 2018-12-07 21:04:15 There are oil refineries in the middle of the ocean?
5198 2018-12-07 21:04:13 Sure the CEO is firmer head of major oil company with an independent board and he's the lazy stupid one. He says you, who inherited his wealth, broke numerous laws, and went bankrupt multiple times is the stupid lazy one. If only I knew who to being.
5199 2018-12-07 21:04:13 Fact check it Rach. I see what you're doing with the 10% claim. "Energy Sector" includes gas, electricity.... not just oil, and not just Alberta oil. Alberta oil in all forms is likely less than 5%... who do you think you're fooling?
5200 2018-12-07 21:04:12 I don’t think you become the CEO of a major oil corporation by being dumb as a rock. Wait!  So ashamed you are our President
5201 2018-12-07 21:04:12 Everyone is different, but I wash my face in the morning & night with Noxema skin cleanser & then I put tea tree oil on my pimples & blemishes
5202 2018-12-07 21:04:06 I hooked a helicopter to a oil rig and brought the whole place to flames :p
5203 2018-12-07 21:04:03 If you can’t do your own oil change and breaks you’re useless
5204 2018-12-07 21:03:52 Coñooo oil feliz cumple
5205 2018-12-07 21:03:48 Excellent work big oil! Koch brothers are proud of FUD spread this week $TSLQ
5206 2018-12-07 21:03:48 Sir, I have to say that I think you should rewrite this tweet.  Tillerson was the head of a major oil company.  Perhaps he took a job that he found out he didn’t want after a long & successful career and didn’t want to put the time in that the job needed.  Pompeo is a better fit.
5207 2018-12-07 21:03:42 Grappling onto my jet plane and crashing into many explosive oil buildings in the 3rd game! #freecodefridaycontest
5208 2018-12-07 21:03:37 Now that Trump calls him dumb, Tillerson is treated by media like a  truth teller-

But back when Trump nominated Tillerson, there were all those journo hot takes about Russia, oil fields, Exxon, blah blah etc “this proves Putin controls Trump”

What a joke.
5209 2018-12-07 21:03:34 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ #StopSaudiOil
5210 2018-12-07 21:03:33 I guess some people use for retwisting and some use oil.  I never know which to choose
5211 2018-12-07 21:03:25 Putin will make half a trillion dollars from that much untapped oil. All pumped tax-free through Crimea, stolen from Ukraine, now owned by Russia.
5212 2018-12-07 21:03:22 Huge relief for arthritis. Especially psoriatic. The meds for it is an auto immune suppressant that can lead to cancer. The gel & oil works wonders.
5213 2018-12-07 21:03:15 The only way you could bully an oil executive is if you took all of his money, covered it in oil and lit it on fire and then shoved him off of an oil refinery into the middle of the ocean.
5214 2018-12-07 21:03:11 After Obama sanctioned Russia for the invasion, they could only pump oil from approximately 3 of those 60 million acres. With Trump and Sessions in office, he unilaterally removed sanctions.
5215 2018-12-07 21:03:09 The craziest thing I've done is using a cow to destory an oil rig #freecodefridaycontest
5216 2018-12-07 21:03:01 It is said that the USS Arizona will "weep" (leak oil) until the last survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack passes away.
5217 2018-12-07 21:03:01 Destroying an entire oil refinery #freecodefridaycontest
5218 2018-12-07 21:02:54 Loved Blowing up the oil rigs in JC3. That game is soooo fun. Can’t wait for JC4. #freecodefridaycontest
5219 2018-12-07 21:02:50 What are you saying about oil executives?
5220 2018-12-07 21:02:36 Grappling a helicopter to a gas station in Just Cause 3 while driving an oil rigger at it #freecodefridaycontest
5221 2018-12-07 21:02:13 Noooooo. Lit soy más virgen que el extra virgen olive oil.
5222 2018-12-07 21:02:12 Yeah it takes no business or diplomatic skill to run a multi national oil  company. Gimme a break.
5223 2018-12-07 21:02:11 Texas Oil is 167 Billion industry.  Texas politicians are beholden to Oil, finance, and usually a few other power brokers. You can hold that against them, I wouldn't ague with it. But for Cruz oil donations is in the top few of his list. For Beto, at the bottom of it.
5224 2018-12-07 21:02:10 He SUCCESSFULLY ran the biggest oil company in the world! I did not like the way he ran State, but he stood up to you. All you’ve done is bankrupt business after business, bankrupt democracy and prove that you are the most stupid man to hold a presidential position. #Sad
5225 2018-12-07 21:02:10 Other than eating your fruit and veg, eat your nuts and seeds! Avocados and olives have good fat in them, but it's OK to use a little oil and brown sugar in your cooking if you're trying to keep on weight.
5226 2018-12-07 21:02:08 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
5227 2018-12-07 21:02:06 Notley - look at the comments to this.
You can't win on a pro-oil platform. The UCP will always be willing to go further towards serving big oil. All you are doing is disseminating the ideology that will defeat you, and all other left ideas in the province.
5228 2018-12-07 21:02:01 USA couldn't afford for bad PPL in the middle east to take over the oil fields causing disruption of oil! The same is true for US steel & aluminum! We don't want these foreign countries holding USA hostage bc we don't make steel! 

YOU CAN'T ADMIT THIS CAN YOU!
5229 2018-12-07 21:01:53 A huge thank you to Kieran at @LushOxfordSt @LushLtd for helping me today choose bits and pieces as presents for Christmas and for helping me to choose a facial oil and cleanser for myself. He was so sweet to use his random act of kindness on me; I’ll definitely enjoy Cinders! 
5230 2018-12-07 21:01:51 "Oil and Gas" has been f***ing "we the people" since Titusville. So KMA.
5231 2018-12-07 21:01:47 As you are so familiar with our coastal geography, and the location of the oil terminal, you must know your comments are fallacious.
5232 2018-12-07 21:01:47 Ga Dadi
5233 2018-12-07 21:01:47 Putin subsequently invaded Ukraine in 2014, secured the routes to export the oil tax-free by sea, and took control of the port where their Black Sea Naval Fleet is based, by taking the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine by force.
5234 2018-12-07 21:01:44 Both politic for oil. Be it Saudi, Qatari or shaking the states.
5235 2018-12-07 21:01:38 Hard day for airlines but we are getting a dead cat in oil bc of OPEC. So we'll see.
5236 2018-12-07 21:01:36 Yeah he only knows how to profit off of oil.
5237 2018-12-07 21:01:35 Tekniken har ju gjort otroliga framsteg de senaste åren och oljekällor som tidigare övergavs har blivit aktiva igen tack vare mer kostnadseffektiv teknik. Samtidigt så verkar exempelvis artic oil vara väldigt dyrt att ta upp och kräver ett högt oljepris.
5238 2018-12-07 21:01:26 Exxon Mobil, under Rex Tillerson, brokered a deal with Russia in 2013 for 60 million acres of Russian land to pump oil out of, but all that Russian oil went through pipelines in the Ukraine.
5239 2018-12-07 21:01:15 After my oil change today I decided throwing my car away and riding a bike will be the move
5240 2018-12-07 21:01:13 That's called cooperation. Mueller got bigger fish to fry and Flynn knows the hot cooking oil. Manifort want to play games, he be in prison a long, long,, time. Pardons dont work in NY. Is trump worth it?? Who is he loyal to????
5241 2018-12-07 21:01:08 Now that Trump calls him dumb, Tillerson is treated by media like a  truth teller-

But back when Trump nominated Tillerson, there were all those journo hot takes about Russia, oil fields, Exxon, blah blah etc “this proves Putin controls Trump”

What a joke.
5242 2018-12-07 21:01:02 How do I ask for an oil change for xmas
5243 2018-12-07 21:00:57 This sounds like the Alberta version of American "exceptionalism", a ridiculous claim. As an Albertans I reject that idea. We're all working schmucks, some happen to live in an oil province, some not. There is no extra virtue in working in oil and gas.

~occasionally use castor oil
~don’t use too much of shampoo/conditioner 
~use natural products
5247 2018-12-07 21:00:31 I think Tillerson was there for a reason in start to open up some doors for Trumps adm. To make some good connections on the world stage and then let go. Big oil workings
5248 2018-12-07 21:00:30 In our country the UAE. We are trying to diversify our income. And we are using Oil money to invest in other sectors intentionally.
5249 2018-12-07 21:00:29 To be fair we haven’t had to much bother with oil leaks, few operator error but on the whole pretty good. Actually find we use the compactor plate the most on the oil quick 
5250 2018-12-07 21:00:29 I would do fish first then chips in the oil that has the seasoned remnants in it. “Dirtier” oil for them
5251 2018-12-07 21:00:26  I will donate the cooking oil
5252 2018-12-07 21:00:26 Tillerson gutted State, and failed to accomplish anything while there.  Trump praised him initially to give him confidence, then let him go when he discovered he was not cut out for anything other than making deals for oil.  Condi Rice was wrong.
5253 2018-12-07 21:00:24 Peak Oil entfernt sich immer weiter.
Für mich ein kleiner Kulturschock.
Die Steinzeit ist nicht aus einem Mangel an Steinen zu Ende gegangen.
Beim Öl ist es vielleicht auch nicht anders!
5254 2018-12-07 21:00:23 Ты мне напомнила меня перед выходом последних серий второго сезона. Как-то так я и возвращалась. И офигела со всего
5255 2018-12-07 21:00:21 Im picky with perfume, which is why I often prefer my own essential oil blends. I favor perfumes that dont smell??? like perfume????
5256 2018-12-07 21:00:20 Oil powers civilisation to provide the benefits of modern lifestyles.
5257 2018-12-07 21:00:19 食パンさんおはようございます！
5258 2018-12-07 21:00:10 Oil is fungible. You remove Saudi Oil, watch how price of US oil shoots up. So yes your ICE vehicles are still being subsidized by being buddies with Saudi Arabia and spending trillions supporting their interests.
5259 2018-12-07 21:00:09 the fall is not deep as i thought.  Expected 50.6-51.6 Be careful, #usoil might be fast 60+ because of contract ends near and probably bullish report than previous weeks on #eia. is coming. DANGER for shorts now. Rig count Canada and USA as oil rigs total 27 down #crudeoli #oott
5260 2018-12-07 21:00:08 Now that Trump calls him dumb, Tillerson is treated by media like a  truth teller-

But back when Trump nominated Tillerson, there were all those journo hot takes about Russia, oil fields, Exxon, blah blah etc “this proves Putin controls Trump”

What a joke.
5261 2018-12-07 21:00:07 Pretty sure when Trump appointed a greedy multimillionaire oil tycoon with Russian ties to be his Sec of State he wasn't expecting to be lectured on his own ethics. When even Rex Tillerson thinks you're too sketchy, you must be one sociopathic mother.
5262 2018-12-07 21:00:05 Interesting.  I wonder if we hear something about Tillerson, Mueller, and the Russian Rosneft oil deal.
5263 2018-12-07 20:59:54 Im so bitter that the political elites are and have become the puppets of  BIG OIL .... rather than get me justice they prefer the brown envelopes
5264 2018-12-07 20:59:52 We haven’t lit it yet. But the recipe was soooo wrong. Said I’d use 7 cups of wax to make 8 oz candle. I used 3 cups for 12 ounces. But it was 10 drops of oil per cup. So the candle not lit smells like heaven!
5265 2018-12-07 20:59:47 Bunker fuel is the final byproduct of petroleum distillation.  It has everything they can't put into gasoline, diesel, or heating oil.  I laugh, every time fuel is cleaned up the bad stuff goes into bunker fuel.  It goes into the air anyway.  Buy American.
5266 2018-12-07 20:59:46 Remember when I called for top in SP500 or Oil? 
5267 2018-12-07 20:59:45 drink lots of water / change your sheets twice a month & use tee trea oil for your pimples
5268 2018-12-07 20:59:34 I've been saying it since before Thanksgiving something's happening over at Fox the oil turning into Trump bashes lately has anybody else noticed that not completely but just enough to make you think what's really going on at Fox News interesting as far as Tucker I don't know
5269 2018-12-07 20:59:32 I don’t use hair butter bc it causes build up, but @BlackOrchid_BBO has the best oil I’ve ever used on my locs.

5271 2018-12-07 20:59:27 I was in the waiting room for my annual checkup and 4 older women were talking happy as you please about cannabis oil for their hands and getting their medical marijuana cards. I just chuckled to myself about how time (and grandmothers) have changed.

5274 2018-12-07 20:59:13 Well seeing as Shetland is looking at independence, in the case of Scottish independence... yes they would be. Seeing as that is where the oil is.
5275 2018-12-07 20:59:06 Top the oil prior
Make sure to keep the schedule
5276 2018-12-07 20:59:03 had instituted. An imaginary oil crisis was invented, and the petroleum industry jacked up prices repeatedly until they were at the level they would have been if Nixon had not put price controls on the industry. There was no justification for this. It was simple greed. The point
5277 2018-12-07 20:58:51 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5278 2018-12-07 20:58:51 Now that Trump calls him dumb, Tillerson is treated by media like a  truth teller-

But back when Trump nominated Tillerson, there were all those journo hot takes about Russia, oil fields, Exxon, blah blah etc “this proves Putin controls Trump”

What a joke.
5279 2018-12-07 20:58:50 Who's dumb as a rock, @realdonaldtrump, who can't construct an intelligible sentence, or the one that ran the largest oil and gas company in the world?  You decide.
5280 2018-12-07 20:58:48 Wanted to make sure.  My reasoning that before the Coconut fat is added, even with the chocolate added, its still lean enough that you cant really over mix it.  A question I always wondered:  Refined Coconut Oil or Unrefined in general? (I think you answered this before)
5281 2018-12-07 20:58:48 You cannot subsidize profit worshiping oil corporations and expect them fight climate change.

5284 2018-12-07 20:58:31 You should really try to think about bringing the country”together”. Wake up!This country is more divided now than it has been since theQuebec referendum. @YourAlberta @NLtweets should not be ignored and should be given the same respect as Quebec and Ontario.Oil is still relevant
5285 2018-12-07 20:58:28 Not that I know of.

It’s just the *old Texas/Oil/Govt powere gang* were all back together, nostalgic, bitter - the normal stuff of funerals.

Emotions are usually the driving force.
5286 2018-12-07 20:58:24 I’m finna eat all the free snacks in this dealership since they wanna take so long with this oil change.
5287 2018-12-07 20:58:14 I don’t get free oil changes :(

5289 2018-12-07 20:58:08 I live in a place with a TON of sunshine. Most new houses built here are automatically installed with solar. That is the future. Oil and coal is the past.  Why are we supporting the Saudis? The majority of the hijackers were Saudi.
5290 2018-12-07 20:58:07 Today climate change dire warnings have been in the media cycle. Also: Only 50 (less?) years before we have sucked up the last of the fossil fuels. The World is ill-prepared to function and move World commerce, and people, without oil.
5291 2018-12-07 20:58:00 Can’t wait to try my vitamin E oil 
5292 2018-12-07 20:57:58 There’s one side of climate change. It’s happening. The other “side” is how much money are you being payed to deny it for the oil and coal companies?
5293 2018-12-07 20:57:56 The way the “east” treats and disrespects the “west” and all the people from it like our way of life is barbaric & we all deserve layoffs & our families to struggle and starve because “oil is bad...” is truly insane!!
5294 2018-12-07 20:57:50 Ao longo do tempo é o shale oil que fará a diferença

5296 2018-12-07 20:57:36 That's a shame. Though I think part of the problem is your scalp may start over-producing oil BECAUSE you wash it every day. I had really oily hair & skin when I was younger, and I could never seem to get ahead of it. Not now - one GOOD thing that came out of getting older!
5297 2018-12-07 20:57:28 “He insulted the intelligence of an old, white, ridiculously wealthy former oil CEO? OH MAN, THAT F’ING DOES IT!!!”
5298 2018-12-07 20:57:19 Yeah. CEO of largest oil company versus CEO of Trump steaks.
5299 2018-12-07 20:56:59 How about less OPEC oil?
5300 2018-12-07 20:56:44 The man that was the CEO of the largest oil company in the world was dumb. Got it
5301 2018-12-07 20:56:40 Perhaps just not socialist enough? Had Chavez chained the coupsters in 2002, or perhaps expropriated reactionary media and corporations, the economy would've stayed buoyant? But then there would still be the sanctions, (not to mention the global oil price crash).

5303 2018-12-07 20:56:37 Great timing, right? Jobs growth lower than expected, corps moving factories offshore over tariffs, tax cut and trade war blowing up deficit and debt, stock market running for cover, recession predicted in a year, Trump is shunned at G20, and now oil supply dries up.

5309 2018-12-07 20:56:17 I use purple shampoo to tone my blonde but I really don’t wash my hair every day, I usually do rotate my products every 2-3 days depending on my hair. And for conditioner I use the suave Moroccan oil infusion and I use that every time I wet my hair
5310 2018-12-07 20:56:16 Just oil money, eh Quebec?
5311 2018-12-07 20:56:15 And yet Democrat voters nominated and elected her.. Those others you mentioned are politically seasoned enough to know that her message is poison to most of the nation, but she's a Democrat plain and simple these days.

"I needed an oil change and I had to have done within an hour. It was completed in 20 minutes and was on my way. Excellent service. Thanks, Bob Dixon"
- B. D.
5313 2018-12-07 20:56:05 Nope. Earthquakes and the fact that the industry won’t release what is in the fracking fluid. Not to mention it is not profitable AND water should it be wasted on this in the SW. Ridiculous. America doesn’t even use fracked shale oil. This is all about profits.
5314 2018-12-07 20:56:03 Tree nut oil!?
5315 2018-12-07 20:55:59 Some people think fossil fuels are the decaying carcasses of dinosaurs

This is, not right

The earth is making them and has been making them for a long time
5316 2018-12-07 20:55:55 Kinda makes you wonder how a lazy dude could run a multinational oil company???
5317 2018-12-07 20:55:51 Not our oil interests. Just globalism. They make us believe that we needed to do this
5318 2018-12-07 20:55:50 The temptation to just shove my head into the boiling vats of oil grows by the second.
5319 2018-12-07 20:55:39 Lol. Some GPs really take mental illness for a joke. Imagine having to write “lavender oil” as a prescription after 5 years of med school. Really nigga?

5323 2018-12-07 20:55:31 @CNBC with wages growing at over 3%, how can David Zervos say there’s no indication of potential high inflation?!? Who is this guy from Jefferies?!? Historically, the issue has been that the Fed has reacted too late. Oil prices will go up after OPEC’s cut. @jefmacrostrat
5324 2018-12-07 20:55:25 Yes, I own an oil rig , im presently mining ( that’s an oil rig word) for olive oil of the coast of Italy. If I take a long time to reply, it’s because I might have to travel on a secret space shuttle to blow up a hemmeroid which is on a collision course..
5325 2018-12-07 20:55:12 Says the man that can't construct a coherent sentence about a man that ran the largest oil and gas company in the world.
5326 2018-12-07 20:55:05 well sad to hear you don’t support Alberta’s oil industry now just show your support to stop there payments
5327 2018-12-07 20:54:59 There is hope under this government than the previous government where people like you were  giving V8 for no work done. Every Ghanaian child is benefiting from the oil wealth and this only is far better than all policies under NDC.

5333 2018-12-07 20:54:08 The NS premier is echoing what we heard from @BlaineHiggs and in contrast to the Que premier - we need oil and the money it generates. #cndpoli #ableg
5334 2018-12-07 20:54:04 In the unlikely event of independence, the oil reserves would have to be negotiated... and at the moment the UK gov is supporting Northsea oil, not the other way around... the price of oil is very low at the moment.

5342 2018-12-07 20:53:24 Russia would not have sided with opec today, in their production cuts, and that's whats pushing oil prices up.  Rex loved Russia, but trump let him go because he had to start supporting the sovereignty of Ukraine.  Oil up 5% today because russia siding with opec

5344 2018-12-07 20:53:17 I thought I was going to learn good TA and price analysis, which was taught.

Instead I realized I was doing a lot of other shit in my life incorrectly. Wasting time and mental effort on BS.

Like paying a mechanic for an oil change but getting a whole new engine for same cost.
5345 2018-12-07 20:53:11 So that if fully recoverable means we can cease the importation of oil into the US for close to 4600 days,   12.5 years at today’s level.
5346 2018-12-07 20:53:09 Oil, oil, oil, oil....Trump is obsessed with it.  So much so, he makes his sons wear gallons of it on their heads.

5348 2018-12-07 20:52:58 yep...the R tactic of "fuck education pay oil cuz they pay me" is working for them...and volunteering and voting isn't doing enough, because while i can cancel out 1 racist relative's vote, i've got a dozen more family members voting against their own interest,

5356 2018-12-07 20:52:29 When asked whether pipelines would be safer than rail transport, @francoislegault seems to try to avoid the question in stating that our target is to reduce oil consumption in Quebec and reiterating Quebec’s surplus of hydroelectricity and how other provinces should buy our hydro
5357 2018-12-07 20:51:59 Rex Tillerson was an oil exec who became the Secretary of State despite his massive conflicts of interest. As Secretary of State, he could make decisions on policies that would directly impact the oil industry. #FlashbackFriday

5362 2018-12-07 20:51:27 The @GOP are selling off America piece by piece to big oil & destroying our clean air/ water/ oceans & planet for profits!They are destroying our democracy by stealing elections& tax payer $. Trump has hired crooks & liars to further pillage US all! Who can support this evil?
5363 2018-12-07 20:51:27 Gosh, I remember reading something years ago, that they knew we had a ton of oil, but the tech wasn't there to get it. At least that's what the article said. Who knows.

5372 2018-12-07 20:50:43 oil is up 5% last time i checked because russia just sided with opec.  Are you missing rex now?  Because Ukraine isn't  that's the other side of the coin.
5373 2018-12-07 20:50:40 "(without apparently realizing that Pelosi is a great friend to environmentalists)."

She takes donations from oil and gas companies.

"Demonstrating that she hasn't the faintest clue how the government or economy work"

Example?
5374 2018-12-07 20:50:39 Mel: Crash on Hwy 1 in Coldbrook between Lovett Road and South Bishop Road, involving an oil truck and pick-up. Road may be closed in that section while crews are on scene to clean-up.
5375 2018-12-07 20:50:39 So the former CEO of the largest big oil company in the world is lazy and dumb? Are you sure you are not talking about yourself?
5376 2018-12-07 20:50:38 So...if lower oil prices and good job reports can only be credited to Trump...I presume the higher prices and recession soon to come are...Hillary's fault? Or do we just blame Obama as usual?
5377 2018-12-07 20:50:37 This time if recession hits Energies are going down with it.
Demands are gonna fell and there is an over supply in market.

5379 2018-12-07 20:50:36 Ask him if will he consider stop buying Saudi Oil, purchase Cdn oil and do Energy East in exchange for those Quebec Hydro purchases. Also. tell him he is a hypocrite if he doesn't.
5380 2018-12-07 20:50:35 Que premier says the goal is less oil and more hydro so EE pipeline doesn't make sense for Quebec. #cndpoli
5381 2018-12-07 20:50:34 @Beardoil_First wanted some soap bars along with oil. Can't see the soap, is it still available. Also your message section on site will not regognise my email as valid. Think you have a bug.
5382 2018-12-07 20:50:25 United Nations scientific report states that CO2 emissions are acceleration far faster than anticipated.

Ever sensitive to the greater good, Trump urges more coal usage and oil production and removal of tax incentives for alternative energy sources development & production.
5383 2018-12-07 20:50:23 What happened earlier was, I fried fennel, radicchio and rosemary in olive oil, poured in some soya cream, added salt, pepper, heated it through and mixed it into some tagliatelle. It was totally amazing. Now I feel nostalgic for the five minutes of my life when it was my dinner.
5384 2018-12-07 20:50:21 Unless you’re going to change oil, fries first. Put single layer on paper towels on cookie sheet, cover loosely with foil, put in 250 degree oven while fry fish
5385 2018-12-07 20:50:19 I have really sensitive skin, so I wash it once a day at night. I use an exfoliating cleanser, then a gentle toner, then I use face oil as moisturizer. Once a week I do a face mask. Everyone's skin is different, though!

5391 2018-12-07 20:49:57 I actually look forward to when my car ask for a full maintenance, I like the whole process of doing a full oil change and whatever my car needs
5392 2018-12-07 20:49:53 Not to mention the 1500000 septillion for a single oil worker... Only 70 septillion for a factory worker though, that's kinda reasonable? Labour unions have been busy within this game ..  
5393 2018-12-07 20:49:52 OPEC just met & agreed to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels a day... so enjoy these low prices while you can because it’s abt to get rough!!
5394 2018-12-07 20:49:46 Dude, you were Air Force.  All you did was sit down anyway .  Maybe you should look at the economy, unemployment numbers, the fact we just exported more oil than we imported, Korea peace, reduced ISIS, and more.  Then tell me the country is being destroyed.
5395 2018-12-07 20:49:43 I need to get an essential oil blend with either rosemary or eucalyptus bc fucking hell, my headaches and mental fatigue are terrible lately.

5397 2018-12-07 20:49:37 @POTUS I disagree with your statement regarding Tillerson. He was CEO of EXXON which is a great company and not bankrupt. I worked for CHEVRON and I know it is hard to run oil co. You are the dummy whose track record is filled with BK, fraud, tax evasion and failures. Keep quiet.
5398 2018-12-07 20:49:36 Enbridge Line 78 (was 6B) provides vast majority of oil to Marathon refinery, NOT #LINE 5! Sen. Hollier @adamant4Detroit voting yes on #SB1197 to keep it open was a huge mistake. @mihousedems @misendems Why are you helping @onetoughnerd ?  
Adam fight for our natural resources!
5399 2018-12-07 20:49:24 So your long term plan is genuinely that humanity drives around in coal-powered cars after the oil runs out?

& we go back to victorian steam power instead of inventing new tech

What are you, vegan?
5400 2018-12-07 20:49:23 You brought Tillerson on to help with the Oil deal in Russia, dont lie.. Thats why you didnt agree with sanctions, when the deal couldnt be done you blame everyone else
5401 2018-12-07 20:49:16 my body oil is here so the skin on my shoulders & shoulder blades can stop cryin
5402 2018-12-07 20:49:13 My Dad sat us down and taught us about the real world... starting when I was about three... I put it all aside... and then the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster happened. BP and the gubmint wanted to create an bio fuel algae farm. It's about the size of Connecticut now.
5403 2018-12-07 20:49:12 Amen, Sir.
5404 2018-12-07 20:49:10 The Great Oil Filter perhaps? Civilizations destroying themselves by going batshit crazy over oil.
5405 2018-12-07 20:49:10 予選お疲れさまでした！

ちなみに本選の予定まだでて無い感じですか？

5410 2018-12-07 20:48:52 I thought I was about to take 35mg of THC in an oil, but I almost took 225mg THC instead by accident!  That was a close one. 

Reminder: Percent (%) and mg are two diff. things.
5411 2018-12-07 20:48:51 Only trump can make an oil company executive look like the model of integrity.
5412 2018-12-07 20:48:51 Identity Network Quote Today

When we come together in unity with the goal of fellowship in the Presence of God through worship and prayer, the oil of His manifested Presence is poured out upon us.
5413 2018-12-07 20:48:50 £150 notes for a new empty barrel, £56 notes for a barrel of Oil?   
. Can we take the empties back?
5414 2018-12-07 20:48:47 I won't mention the shooting of unarmed civilians le discipline water and oil
5415 2018-12-07 20:48:44 But somehow that wasn't a problem as long as he was getting his big oil friends whatever they wanted at our expense. Fuck Rex and fuck John Kelly also. They knew, they profited and now they are trying to cover their asses.
5416 2018-12-07 20:48:37 The whole world is laughing at Trump. Tillerson ran the largest oil company in the world, Exxon! Trump ran a family business, that couldn’t go public&5 bankruptcies. Pompeo was a Kansas Sen! Give us a break! Tillerson, the man he trumps both of y’all!
5417 2018-12-07 20:48:34 Trump fired rex because rex was too friendly with russia.  Rex was friendly with russia, because russia sends energy to europe, and other countries, which undermines opec's power.  Today's surge in oil prices wouldn't have happened if rex was in charge.
5418 2018-12-07 20:48:31 “The results of this most recent assessment and that of the Wolfcamp Formation in the Midland Basin in 2016 are our largest continuous oil and gas assessments ever released,” added Dr. Jim Reilly, USGS Director
5419 2018-12-07 20:48:29 Then gasoline and heating oil prices should be low in our country.
5420 2018-12-07 20:48:26 you wanna fight bro? you wanna wrestle it out bro? you wanna settle this like the ultra masculine ancient greeks did bro? completely naked and slathered in olive oil so our glistening muscles shine in the setting sun as we grunt and sweat out our differences bro?
5421 2018-12-07 20:48:25 Now we don't have to bend to the demand for foreign oil supply. The Red Wave continues...#Winning
5422 2018-12-07 20:48:23 I need to get my oil changed lol 
5423 2018-12-07 20:48:22 The people telling you oil is safe are all paid by oil. Don’t believe it.
5424 2018-12-07 20:48:17 Eni per cambiare dovrebbe fare le stesse cose di Enel che senso avere il doppione? Poi chi sarebbero i competitor big oil&gas che avrebbero cambiato veramente strategia per uscire dagli idrocarburi?
5425 2018-12-07 20:48:07 Oregano oil has got to be one of the most disgusting edible substances on the planet.
5426 2018-12-07 20:47:58 Trivia: One day before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USS Arizona fueled up to its capacity (1.5 millions gallons). Though much of it ignited when the ship was bombed, approximately 9 quarts of oil continue to leak from the wreckage each day. The Arizona still bleeds...#Dec7th
5427 2018-12-07 20:47:54 I have no idea of the real downsides of carbon tariffs( beyond we’re plugged into the global oil market. We arn’t an island)  but seem to recall Obama sorta kicked the idea around. Why not?
5428 2018-12-07 20:47:50 this is going to be a funny story to tell my kids one day  coconut oil, who knew 
5429 2018-12-07 20:47:49 In the past 5 years I’ve been on 7 antidepressants, 3 antipsychotics, 3 anxiolytics, seen 6 therapists, went thru TMS therapy, tried CBD oil, edibles, exercise 4-5 times a week, started eating healthier, sleep 8 hours a night and no matter what I always feel like shit. But...
5430 2018-12-07 20:47:46 Now that Trump calls him dumb, Tillerson is treated by media like a  truth teller-

But back when Trump nominated Tillerson, there were all those journo hot takes about Russia, oil fields, Exxon, blah blah etc “this proves Putin controls Trump”

What a joke.
5431 2018-12-07 20:47:43 Fatty acid content varies with database - not my fault. (Besides, I never did well in math!) Another con-founder, bacon fat depends on pig's diet - varies. Fatty acid content of bacon & olive oil overlap a lot - dominantly saturated & monounsaturated
5432 2018-12-07 20:47:39 I've decided I don't really like olive oil and I'm never putting it on anything ever again.
5433 2018-12-07 20:47:24 He didn't want him. That was putins choice in the hopes of doing big oil deals.
5434 2018-12-07 20:47:21 The best way for essential oils to work is to use them daily. If you use them now and then because you like them that's ok but if you want the therapeutic effects of a high quality oil then daily use is best. For colds I use On Guard. The cold clears within 24 hrs.
5435 2018-12-07 20:47:13 And our not too distant neighbors say 'oyel' instead of oil
5436 2018-12-07 20:47:11 I remember visiting pearl harbor over 25 years ago. There was still oil coming up from the ship. Incredible experience everyone should do.
5437 2018-12-07 20:47:08 Norway seems to be doing fine (democratic socialism and oil/gas primary export); though they aren't a one-party system. 

Not like it really matters, Norwegians don't eat dogs or get humor so 
5438 2018-12-07 20:47:06 Like olive oil?
5439 2018-12-07 20:46:56 Our oil consumption is over the top!!!
5440 2018-12-07 20:46:56 So it's ok then for socialists to take corporate money? Politicians are supposed to be representing the people and not selling their influence to big oil or wall street.
5441 2018-12-07 20:46:48 “Christmas Mubarak”  is some sort of twisted perversion. Mixing oil and water produces nothing useful.
5442 2018-12-07 20:46:48 lmao that’s the famous strawberry cake it is  that’s the one I’m talking about , they always want me to make bc my cakes be moist I put butter in my mix instead of oil 
5443 2018-12-07 20:46:37 and "lazy as hell." dumb and lazy are apparently the secret recipe for becoming CEO of the biggest oil company in the world, according to our president.
5444 2018-12-07 20:46:37 Wow my engine and baby oil  Hotspot.   Sxpx
5445 2018-12-07 20:46:32 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
5446 2018-12-07 20:46:19 on this oil lookin fa trouble
5447 2018-12-07 20:46:16 Do it with a little oil and spread some flour they never stick like that if you’re not using parchment paper!!!
5448 2018-12-07 20:46:12 actually Justin is the problem, If he stalls Alberta and Canada with the pipeline ,,then why allow Saudi oil entering our country? Hypocrite?? Carbon tax is theft!
5449 2018-12-07 20:46:09 Not to sound like a hippie but have you tried lavender oil on his pillow case? Maybe a foot massage before bed with it as well? I’m sure you have a set bedtime routine... maybe a warm bath and something hot to drink too before he goes to sleep?
5450 2018-12-07 20:46:08 more pish from res tories.  snake oil salesman is more honest that these ppl
5451 2018-12-07 20:46:08 If you don't spend time with God, the oil in your lamp will go out.

5457 2018-12-07 20:45:49 i think more accept it than you realize. We just believe it isnt as intense and as a result we are more open to economic oppurtunities like oil that we think isn’t AS damaging as protrayed
5458 2018-12-07 20:45:44 Dude: their cars run on *gasoline*, not oil!
5459 2018-12-07 20:45:43 Let's see. Rex Tillerson only headed up the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company. I guess you have to be dumb as a rock to get that job!!! Wondered how long it would be b4 Rex spilled the beans. Thank you Rex.
5460 2018-12-07 20:45:40 Putin told Trump to hire Tillerson.  Remember the sanctions,  Exxon Mobil, oil? Remember the deal between  Russia and Exxon? Come on guys in a round about way Tillerson just told us that Putin told Trump to hire him.
5461 2018-12-07 20:45:39 おはよーございまーす
5462 2018-12-07 20:45:39 Norway is another country.

This is Scotland.

Your 2013 Wipe Paper talked of oil revenues between £6.7 - 7.9bn by ‘indy day’: history shows it raised only £100m. 

As good a warning into the pig in a poke Utopia that Nationalist snake oil salesmen sought to sell Scotland.
5463 2018-12-07 20:45:38 You picked Tillerson- he should have been disqualified over conflicts of interest with big oil but your entire cabinet is unqualified for one reason or another!
5464 2018-12-07 20:45:38 Не, наоборот, меня окружают хорошие люди, которые обо мне тоже заботятся.
5465 2018-12-07 20:45:38 Sometimes painting can be a hurry up and wait game. Ive been waiting 4 hours in an 80 degree house for these damn doors to dry so I can put the last coat on them and I cant take any of the stuff off the floor yet because I cant get this oil paint all over the hardwood.
5466 2018-12-07 20:45:35 “Among the world’s biggest political spenders are Charles and David #Koch, co-owners of #KochIndustries, a vast private conglomerate of oil pipelines and refineries, chemicals, timber and paper companies, commodity trading firms and cattle ranches.”
5467 2018-12-07 20:45:33 Probably missing a muffler but also a good idea to check underneath to see if the oil pan and/or transmission are leaking.   Don’t ask how I know. 
5468 2018-12-07 20:45:27 Good question:'why did we fight wars over oil? Good old fashioned globalism
5469 2018-12-07 20:45:27 @itvcorrie chemo therapy searches out all cells and kills them all ,cannibas oil searches out the cancer cells and makes them kill themselves . Also chemo is mustard gas and was used against our soldiers in the first world war in the trenches .
5470 2018-12-07 20:45:20 I’m not even bout to look up if it has negative effects but I got sum tea tree oil in my weed n that shit was really good. The hit is refreshing
5471 2018-12-07 20:45:15 Getting my oil changed...guy at the counter is literally sitting there playing solitaire. He answered the phone on the 5th ring and said “man I’ll have to call you back, I’m covered up”. 
5472 2018-12-07 20:45:13 Oh no, they always have money for oil companies.
5473 2018-12-07 20:45:09 おはよー
5474 2018-12-07 20:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
5475 2018-12-07 20:44:57 ऐसे 2 कोड़ी के लोगो की औकात नहीं जो oil की प्राइस को influence कर सके। Opec has already decided to cut production.
5476 2018-12-07 20:44:54 12:33 PM : OPEC members to cut output by 800,000 barrels a day, which could cause oil prices to rise.  This could be inflationary and is something we should be keeping an eye on.
5477 2018-12-07 20:44:52 The increased shipping traffic of oil tankers? As compared to the vastly increase of container, ferry, and pleasure craft traffic that dwarfs the proposed new oil tankers by comparison?
5478 2018-12-07 20:44:51 YAY!! About time! We have more oil in the US than the Middle East. Finally a President who Isn't afraid to go for it!
5479 2018-12-07 20:44:46 Haha.? I hear ya!. My Latino daughter-in-law and sister went into a grocery store asking for Pinesol. They asked one of the guys there. But they pronounced it Penis Oil. Wish I would have been there.
5480 2018-12-07 20:44:36 i come into get my oil changed and turns out there is 25 other problems with my car hahahaha
5481 2018-12-07 20:44:36 Imagine the oil wearing this ... yellow oil
5482 2018-12-07 20:44:34 Meat isn't the issue.
Supporting feed lot based factory farms is the issue.
My freezer is full, but I don't feel guilty about it, because none of it came from those fake farms that DO abuse animals.
As big an issue (or bigger?) is choosing to wear pleather... oil based & toxic.
5483 2018-12-07 20:44:34 I’m convinced coconut oil is the answer to everything. 
5484 2018-12-07 20:44:25 Beth Wilder risked blowing her cover to write a screenplay. Sounds like you didn't exactly burn the midnight oil.
5485 2018-12-07 20:44:20 I think the real reason Donnie hates him is because he failed to get sanctions lifted against the firm financing the major oil find off Vlad's coast. They needed Exxon for their drilling capabilities but they pulled out and the deal fell through. Vlad then made him fire Rex!
5486 2018-12-07 20:44:19 If you cared about our Great Lakes then why won't you support fixing the oil pipeline that could break at any time? You don't support the best thing for our environment.
5487 2018-12-07 20:44:14 今使ってる油彩用のメディウムの匂いがひどいし、健康にも良くなさそうだから早くGreen for Oilを買わないと。。
5488 2018-12-07 20:44:10 you could fry a whole chicken with the amount of oil my face produces throughout the day 
5489 2018-12-07 20:44:04 Fun fact- If u go visit the US Arizona in Hawaii you can still see oil on top of the water that’s still leaking out of the ship after 76 years
5490 2018-12-07 20:43:51 But is there oil in that there rock?
5491 2018-12-07 20:43:45 Tillerson was CEO of $XOM. Big oil & gas plan projects to deliver produce 20-30 years down the road. Tillerson understands how the world works. But he was the wrong man for that job. He should not have accepted it.
5492 2018-12-07 20:43:42 Olive oil
5493 2018-12-07 20:43:40 I agree we should never forget the cowardly attack.  Let's also not forget why they did it.  We placed sanctions on them and had an oil embargo as well.  Be careful with sanctions. The attack was a play for oil.
5494 2018-12-07 20:43:39 I agree with him on this, but also question what Rex's goals were. I believe he accomplished them and got out,  but what were they? He is a friend to Putin and tied up in big oil, so it has to be along those lines. He is not clean.
5495 2018-12-07 20:43:33 I wear a size 10” mishimoto universal oil cooler in gold that’s on sale rn part number “MMOC-10”
5496 2018-12-07 20:43:32 Fried potato pancakes, called latkes in Yiddish and levivot in Hebrew, are the most popular Hanukkah food. They are shredded potatoes mixed with onion, egg, flour and seasonings, then formed into small pancakes and fried in oil.
5497 2018-12-07 20:43:31 yes and that confirms what we all know.... they were at full capacity.... that is very risky.... but mr @realDonaldTrump does not understand how the oil industry works... (and not only the real estate one....)
5498 2018-12-07 20:43:20 I do like 80/20 butter to olive oil
5499 2018-12-07 20:43:02 coconut oil
5500 2018-12-07 20:43:01 And baby oil.
5501 2018-12-07 20:42:56 Tone deaf message when we are in the midst of major automotive and oil industry economic peril; but you will receive the message at election time #union #werecoming
5502 2018-12-07 20:42:49 Wow. Just wow. CEO of the largest oil company in the world, "dumb as a rock." I'm no fan of his, but you are headed into libelous territory.
5503 2018-12-07 20:42:48 
5504 2018-12-07 20:42:47 The day will come when customers around the world boycott countries which are still using coal and oil for power and transport.
5505 2018-12-07 20:42:45 Petroleum  is much far better and more marketable esp with Turkana Tullow oil.

5508 2018-12-07 20:42:29 In a world gone pc mad how is rapeseed oil still getting away with it?
5509 2018-12-07 20:42:27 Rex is a bloodless tool of Big Oil. 
But literally *nobody* believes he’s dumber than Trump. 
Least of all, Trump.
5510 2018-12-07 20:42:27 "Tariff Man" the rally call in 2020 that will get you removed. America will know that you hurt farmers, autos, oil, and Americans' retirement accounts and took pride in it.
5511 2018-12-07 20:42:26 Hey Ron your VICTROLA NEEDLE keeps sticking put some oil in all that BLOW-HARD you keep REPEATING Nothing to see here
FOLKS just a bunch of CHEATERCRATS LIERS......
5512 2018-12-07 20:42:21 Yes Natasha you are correct. Putin and Tillerson had a 500 billion dollar oil deal worked out between Putin's oil company and Exxon, then Obama threw in those pesky sanctions!
5513 2018-12-07 20:42:12 Well, who told you to hire him , PUTIN,did it have anything to do with that big oil deal, FLYNN was working on, that would benefit you
5514 2018-12-07 20:42:08 No be small things my brother
5515 2018-12-07 20:41:53 Hmmm, would throwing baked potatoes into an oil spill perhaps be the savior of the environment?
5516 2018-12-07 20:41:51 Ummmm, France is being burned to the ground right now because of great ideas like this.
Macron and Trudeau are both elitist, out of touch, work-shy mental pygmies and the world has had enough of these mincing, flavor of the week, all sizzle and no steak snake oil salesmen
5517 2018-12-07 20:41:44 Yes please 
5518 2018-12-07 20:41:41 That's what we sent her there to do; kill oil.
5519 2018-12-07 20:41:39 Jama'a where is @its_hammadrabiu
5520 2018-12-07 20:41:33 Well, it's Texas and Oil is only number 17 in the top 20 industries that donated to him.  Just saying, it's way down the list in terms of dollars.

5526 2018-12-07 20:41:07 @dulcet_oil santa can I sit on your lap?
5527 2018-12-07 20:41:04 You mean the ballgame of lying, breaking the law and acts of treason?  Because he would play the oil game you and Putin had in mind? Is that the game your talking about.  We see you.
5528 2018-12-07 20:41:03 guessing that they all:
- got all of their clients money out of Bitcoin on December 15th 
- sold all of their clients stocks on September 21st 
- began shorting US crude oil futures on October 3rd
5529 2018-12-07 20:40:59 If oil goes to 70 next week, Rupiah will be at 15.000 and we will have a new President next year. 

Yay. 

That’s about the only good thing about the world going to shit, really. 

I’m going back to Estonia.
5530 2018-12-07 20:40:59 It is a violation of our sovreignity when US threaten us of grave consequences if we bypass the swift system and try to buy iranian oil in our local currency ...beyond the period of the waivwr

5534 2018-12-07 20:40:51 Liar in chief aka Treasonous Trump you dont care about clean water or air, you own shares in multinational big oil companies like Phillips 66, Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil. #OligarchGate #OiligarchGate #ConflictOfInterest #BakkenGate
5535 2018-12-07 20:40:46 Look dummies, Rex was an oil man using his connections to fuck us over for a very long time! 

Rex was dumb enough to sign an agreement never to lobby for a foreign government ever again to take the Sec of State job.

Hence, negating his ability to fuck us again!

Who won?

Us!
5536 2018-12-07 20:40:45 Available to be spoilt.
5537 2018-12-07 20:40:44 I think he wanted credit for all the increased oil revenue from fracking.  The “Change Candidate”. 
5538 2018-12-07 20:40:41 Eh, snake oil salesmen are in every field.
5539 2018-12-07 20:40:32 Rex was able to manage Exxon without any sort of issue..... contrary to Ginger.....
5540 2018-12-07 20:40:23 He could be onto something - look how bad XOM did during oil's bull market.
5541 2018-12-07 20:40:21 WTI Crude Oil 52.61 bbl, +$1.05 $USO
Gold 1252.20 oz+$8.40 $GLD
Copper 2.76 lb +0.02 $CU
5542 2018-12-07 20:40:18 Rex violated our sanctions against Russia trying to broker his biggest oil deal between Russia + @exxonmobil He failed_THEN trump put him in our White House + Rex tried to get sanctions lifted_failed again_THEN He was fired while shyting on a toilet b/c Putin + trump were pissed!
5543 2018-12-07 20:40:14 Want a playbook for the next crisis?   Buy #gold and #oil.
5544 2018-12-07 20:40:06 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
5545 2018-12-07 20:40:05 My dad fussing at me about not getting an oil change... but, it can honestly wait my guy.
5546 2018-12-07 20:40:02 Of course it isn’t the end of the world but these things have repercussions. And with tensions mounting between the US and OPEC countries, it is foolish to look at this as an isolated move that only has to do with oil production through June 2019.
5547 2018-12-07 20:40:01 What a horrible joke you are - so thin skinned for the leader of the free world- but this is really a reaction cause Tillerson didn’t get the sanctions lifted and the $trillion oil deal you wanted Pompeo is a good stooge especially on Koshoggi
5548 2018-12-07 20:40:00 Stop taking money from the oil & gas industry for starters!
5549 2018-12-07 20:39:57 The real reason Donnie hates him is because he failed to get sanctions lifted against the firm financing the major oil find off Vlad's coast. They needed Exxon for their drilling capabilities but they pulled out and the deal fell through. Vlad then made him fire Rex.
5550 2018-12-07 20:39:50 I always tell pple  that there is a deep secret that most pple dnt knw. Now rumours of oil and gas are coming out.
5551 2018-12-07 20:39:45 Who would have thought the leader of a multinational oil company would be more ethical than the President of the US ?
5552 2018-12-07 20:39:41 So QUE still doesn’t want a pipeline going through it.   So let’s turn off oil & gas going there now.
5553 2018-12-07 20:39:35 Oh that's the upgrade? Oh ok. Refined means upgraded. Seen. I wonder why the world revolves around crude oil though and not pms. 
5554 2018-12-07 20:39:29 From one side of your mouth we hear of the economic strengths of Alberta. From the other side we hear of the great Alberta oil crisis. Is Alberta livin' large or languishing at death's door?
5555 2018-12-07 20:39:29 "Nigeria will not return to d period when;

A president & his vice called each other THIEVES

UN building & Police HQ were bombed

A sitting gov was abducted

650k jobseekers were scammed, killing 20 of them

Two big ships disappeared with crude oil without a trace

Never Again!"
5556 2018-12-07 20:39:17 So, I’d pay 15k at the spa for a session that’d last 30minutes... 15k for someone to press my body? 
Like 1k* 15...for my body to get pressed after they’ve rubbed groundnut oil on it?!!! 
5557 2018-12-07 20:39:15 Striking contrast compared to when Trump talked about supporting and reviving the US steel, coal and oil industries. Our feds need to foster a growing business environment. Canadians want to work.
5558 2018-12-07 20:39:10 whole house smells like canola oil #hannukah
5559 2018-12-07 20:39:06 Looking for who can supply us black oil , we need about 33000 litres Asap. @NsukkaBoi @AsiwajuOladimej @femiDNL @dollycent @Burmese_Tyga @Jraimz @Osi_Suave @DEEDOLLAR . Kindly RT . Thanks
5560 2018-12-07 20:39:05 Its a violation of our sovreignity that America wll drop bombs at other country  if they do not do trade in US dollar..see what happenned to saddam hussain when he tried to sell oil in terms of gold....
5561 2018-12-07 20:39:04 Don't know who, probably Vlad but the why was Sanctions, Oil and Russia.
5562 2018-12-07 20:39:03 gotta know a lot about rocks to be good in oil & gas baby
5563 2018-12-07 20:39:03 I oil night
5564 2018-12-07 20:39:02 She should've walked out when QC Legault stated that Quebec has no appetite for Oil & would oppose Energy East if a new application was filed.

They have a DAMN BIG APPETITE FOR ALBERTA'S OIL DOLLARS!

NO more money for the ROC until pipelines COMPLETED both EAST & WEST. @jkenney
5565 2018-12-07 20:39:02 If you were thinking a person couldn’t make popcorn with some corn kernels a year past their best before date and a bottle of Fry-lite instead of oil, why then you would be right my friend 
5566 2018-12-07 20:38:56 Regular has everything to do with it as the rest are executives and corporate shills invested in the oil industry’s profits
5567 2018-12-07 20:38:55 The whole country relies on our resources to keep the economy going. 
It’s hypocritical to claim “the oil is all of Canada’s”, yet not want to help get that oil to market.
5568 2018-12-07 20:38:46 Let's remember why the IJN attacked Pearl Harbor. FDR placed an embargo on oil and steel exports after the Japanese occupied French Indochina. The China lobby was out in full force promoting US involvement. The IJN estimated that in 8 months they would run out of fuel. Attack!
5569 2018-12-07 20:38:45 COT is delayed until Monday. Here is latest data (thru Nov. 27)  fund position as of Dec. 7 assuming trade estimates (# of fut+opt contracts):

5570 2018-12-07 20:38:35 Are we to assume those 57,000,000 acres of undeveloped sanctioned Exxon oil land in Russia and the award from Putin do not still matter to T., Rex?
5571 2018-12-07 20:38:32 Satisfaction ??? Il n’y aura pas de taxes sur le gaz oil l’an prochain soi disant et le reste alors ????
5572 2018-12-07 20:38:29 Don't tell the politicians, both parties.  They'll want to import even more cheap foreign labor for the oil companies so they can keep wages for Americans down.
5573 2018-12-07 20:38:26 At the 10 minute oil change place for 40+ mins wondering WHAT is taking these guys forever?! Then 1 guy hollars: "GUYS there's a goldren retriever in that car!" After a collective AWE they all go back to work. I can't be mad now. 
5574 2018-12-07 20:38:25 You know I’m excited af about graduation. A bitch used coconut oil instead of soap to shave 
5575 2018-12-07 20:38:23 Tony Blair should be in prison !!! #chilcottinquiry#iraq#genocide for profit #oil
5576 2018-12-07 20:38:15 24% of US CO2 emissions come from our #PublicLands 
How can that be?
Coal, oil & natural gas fossil fuels extraction & combustion!!!
Another reason to curb this bull$hit raping & pillaging of our public lands #NaturalResources .
#environment #ClimateChange #GreenNewDeal
5577 2018-12-07 20:38:13 Economic and social justice?
That is what the Communists used in their propaganda to trick the populus to support them.
Venezuela has been chanting this mantra for 24 years and look at that oil rich failed country.
5578 2018-12-07 20:38:09 People in his mentions are like "Uh, actually Mr President, sir, Rex Tillerson ran the world's largest oil company. He clearly isn't dumb as a rock". No, you dorks. Just strap in and enjoy the childish in-fighting. It's only enjoyable part of his administration
5579 2018-12-07 20:38:03 Lmao, you need some Dawn. You look like a manatee caught in an oil spill.
5580 2018-12-07 20:38:00 I follow and olive oil together and is
5581 2018-12-07 20:37:56 Trump: “
Sorry Vlad, I thought I could lift sanctions and get you the Exxon oil pipeline. This Rex dude is too hung up on the law! Don’t worry I’m dumping him ASAP”
5582 2018-12-07 20:37:56 They'll drive themselves everyone else right off of a cliff to line oil executives pockets. 
5583 2018-12-07 20:37:45 どうしよ
5584 2018-12-07 20:37:40 So you're suggestion is he leave unaddressed the comments and accusations against him that Tillerson was making . Yea you dont know this President.  I'm all for the forthrightness. I dont need sugar coating , not a snowflake
5585 2018-12-07 20:37:33 @jiffylube just robbed me. I showed up to a service station and it wasn’t until after I changed my oil and replaced the wiper blades did they tell me my total would be $170.00!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK AND I WILL TELL PEOPLE THE SAME! #ridiculous #ripoff #MerryChristmas
5586 2018-12-07 20:37:21 $CRZO and $NFX actually down 2-3% despite oil and opec.  new lows.   $xle $uso $sop yuck
5587 2018-12-07 20:37:20 But he was the CEO of Exxon, an oil company, and "Texas tea" is another name for oil! This is a good pun! (he screamed into the void...)
5588 2018-12-07 20:37:08 めっちゃおトイレ行きたい今
5589 2018-12-07 20:37:06 In the same way PREPA is currently buying fuel. However, is not the same to buy oil than submitting documents to bid the installation of equipment & machinery that will use LG to generate the electricity.
5590 2018-12-07 20:37:05 Rex violated our sanctions against Russia trying to broker his biggest oil deal between Russia + @exxonmobil He failed_THEN trump put him in our White House and Rex tried to get sanctions lifted_failed again. THEN He was fired while shyting on a toilet! Putin + trump were pissed!
5591 2018-12-07 20:37:03 The more likely options are...
Opt 1. Continue to thrive in EU as worlds’ 5th largest economy.
Opt 2. Keep buying the snake oil from Eton Schoolboys sat on unicorns.
5592 2018-12-07 20:37:00 I been sending my dad BMW’s all day and his response is “ do your expired inspection sticker and oil change then will talk till then leave me alone“   like guy that has nothing toooo do wit it
5593 2018-12-07 20:36:59 Data IS the new oil.
5594 2018-12-07 20:36:57 In his quest for oil
Make no mistake he wants what MBS has after he leaves office
Oil can provide him with continued wealth
No doubt the sir name trump will somehow be connected to it for personal gain
5595 2018-12-07 20:36:57 “We should have taken the oil”
5596 2018-12-07 20:36:51 where does venezuela stand? they were using their oil as a commodity and now they are trying to value back their currency with crypto currency.  do i have that right?
5597 2018-12-07 20:36:44 They will sell oil at a cheaper rate to other countries if that Country pays in Petros
5598 2018-12-07 20:36:37 @itvcorrie  make sure she does it her way and cures her own cancer ,what she is doing is far more healthier and you wont lose your hair or get violently sick because of it , gcmaf , cannibas oil and exercising and keeping fit and healthy will be far more succesful.
5599 2018-12-07 20:36:33 Olive Oil funds the mafia? Does Popeye know about this?
5600 2018-12-07 20:36:18 Rita is back. New chain and sprocket, oil , oil filter ,airfilter. And on the way back she start act again... so we adjusted something which is not the TPS, now she is fine . Who sent that YouTube video??! Seems that was the issue!
5601 2018-12-07 20:36:18 Going go ahead and get this oil changed. Before I’m more of a broke boy than I am currently
5602 2018-12-07 20:36:17 Russia. Oil. Money.
5603 2018-12-07 20:36:17 I'll take the Rostneft Oil Deal and a .05% rake off the top to The Trump Crime Family for $ 200 Alex.

#TheGrandNakuruMeeting
5605 2018-12-07 20:36:13 Cut off transfer payments and put an import tax on all foreign oil and see what happrns
5606 2018-12-07 20:36:06 Crazy week though. Buy the boy has to find a reason to smile
5607 2018-12-07 20:35:51 #WanzhouMeng's lawyer suggest services and equipment actually under US sanctions were in oil and energy sectors, and in tech that could disrupt communications. But #Huawei and SkyCom had focused on civilian telecom services, not military equipment.
5608 2018-12-07 20:35:50 What’s “regular” got to do with it?  It’s Texas. Oil pays very, very well. And many of them are in fact Dems (although not enough of ‘me). These aren’t gas station attendants, but neither are they corporate shills. They also happen to be my family.
5609 2018-12-07 20:35:34 Bingo and that pesky economy keeps improving and that was before oil prices started to climb.
5610 2018-12-07 20:35:33 I find peppermint oil helps relieve tension
5611 2018-12-07 20:35:28 Can essentials oil drops be used on the balls?
5612 2018-12-07 20:35:27 I’ve had my car for 3 years now and I still open my trunk instead of popping my hood when I get my oil changed..
5613 2018-12-07 20:35:26 ew i feel like such a grown up making oil change appointments and doctors appointments for next week 
5614 2018-12-07 20:35:17 That is amazing, isn't it? Oil magnate gets snookered by cheap conman like Trump? Everything is upside down and backwards. Look out, the Sun might start rising in the west one of these days....
5615 2018-12-07 20:35:14 The answer to our problems isn’t independence from foreign oil—it’s eradicating the need for oil at all. We’re not thinking big enough, and we’re not stepping up to do the real work. Our leaders are failing us, and it’s time for every day citizens to say enough is enough. 
5616 2018-12-07 20:35:13 @MSNBC I expect a lot of boomers in the center of the group born circa 52 to 55 were "left out" coming of age in the oil embargo days. I am one of them, people are either "in" the job market or "way out" like I was. Once you are behind it is impossible to catch up, I can testify!
5617 2018-12-07 20:34:59 All of sudden you have the anti cow fart global warming left defending the former CEO of the biggest oil company in the world, classic!!!
5618 2018-12-07 20:34:56 Pot. Kettle. Black. Plus, I don't think Rex could be as dumb as a rock if he helped build up a billion dollar oil company. It's not like he went bankrupt in the casino industry or anything...
5619 2018-12-07 20:34:40 ん〜
5620 2018-12-07 20:34:31 Ur biggest rivals were stockport before the oil money
5621 2018-12-07 20:34:20 Olive oil with flakes of oregano
5622 2018-12-07 20:34:18 Nothing like spending your entire afternoon at Firestone bc they cheesed your appointment time  I just need an oil change fam…
5623 2018-12-07 20:34:08 Yeah the CEO of a multi international oil company.. yeah very stupid
5624 2018-12-07 20:34:03 I will never feel bad for a millionaire oil magnate.
5625 2018-12-07 20:33:56 Girl: Wash the white part a which bomboclaat Vans? A me and you a wear it?

Also girl: Papi come wash my hair, part and scratch, then oil my scalp for me? You know I love you.
5626 2018-12-07 20:33:43 Reminder: Rex violated our sanctions against Russia trying to broker his biggest oil deal ever between Russia + @exxonmobil He failed, THEN trump put him in our White House and Rex tried to get sanctions lifted_failed again. THEN He was fired while shyting on a toilet!
5627 2018-12-07 20:33:42 Awesome week and beauty Friday on the #oil and #potstock trains! Back to cash #wooo have a good weekend fellas!
5628 2018-12-07 20:33:29 I'm so obsessed with oil though #oiltopia
5629 2018-12-07 20:33:28 The real reason you hate him Donnie is because he failed to get sanctions lifted against the firm financing the major oil find off Vlad's coast. They needed Exxon for their drilling capabilities but they pulled out and the deal fell through. Vlad then made you fire him. Amirite?
5630 2018-12-07 20:33:19 No biscuits at work now except Danish butter cookies because all the other stuff contained palm oil. Stopped buying Oreos. My waist line is not sorry and tbh they are too sweet anyway
5631 2018-12-07 20:33:10 @DrOz PALM OIL is devastating to the environment and endangered species.  It shouldn’t be promoted for vanity.
5632 2018-12-07 20:33:09 And less than that, when the idiot Dem scientists, sell their "dimming the Sun" solution to global warming 
5633 2018-12-07 20:33:08 Get it in a pan with a little oil and fry till crisp..and let me know what you think 
5634 2018-12-07 20:33:01 NB Premier on pipelines. @BlaineHiggs The flow of oil isn't going anywhere. Do we want it to be done by rail or by pipeline is the real question? Super relevant, pragmatic, and realistic. Combustibles shouldn't be transported via combustion engines!
5635 2018-12-07 20:33:00 .@BlaineHiggs - if #Quebec wants to put transmission lines through #NB to bring their power generation to the US Seaboard, we want a pipeline through #Quebec to bring #Alberta Oil to #NB & tide water. Goose & gander, Sir. Proud you are our #nbpoli Premier BTW. What a difference!
5636 2018-12-07 20:32:51 Add to that the Unicorn export duty and the Whisky Galore, plus the undiscovered hidden oil field under the Mantle, plus the unfracked gas in Holyrood.
5637 2018-12-07 20:32:41 Yep..oil.
5638 2018-12-07 20:32:36 "This is the age of complaining classes, wether they are lawyers, community activists, radical feminists, race hustlers or other squeaking wheels looking for oil. No society ever thrived from having a large and growing class of parasites living off those who produce."
5639 2018-12-07 20:32:29 The steel Tarriffs are necessary. China's dumping steel & subsidizing it through Gov't payments. It's a matter of National Security! It would be dangerous to allow foreign countries to put all steel co's out of business! Besides. ... why do you think US was in wars over oil!
5640 2018-12-07 20:32:29 Tillerson/Exxon were deeply intwined in an Arctic oil exploration joint venture with Russian state-owned Rosneft that also got scotched by the Magnitsky sanctions, which Putin was furious about.
5641 2018-12-07 20:32:24 How to trim/shape your own beard:
1. Promise to go slow
2. Cut one hair becuz step one
3. oh god that hair was the most important one
4. Existential beard crisis
5. Wildly hack large sections without regard
6. Realize you did fine and finish trimming with scissors
7. Style w/ oil
5642 2018-12-07 20:32:16 Ah the old irrational hatred of oil money. Can't even hate soft power these days without being thrown in prison these days. What is the world coming to.
5643 2018-12-07 20:32:10 He was hired for the russia oil deal!

5649 2018-12-07 20:31:43 If you think that's bad ... have you ever seen the effluent water when you have your carpets steam cleaned?  It's like dirty motor oil.  It's amazing how much dirt carpet can store.
5650 2018-12-07 20:31:39 Holy Jeepers! WHY do you have to tell us this???? Tillerson was your pick! That's what you get when you hire the CEO of an oil company. WE have no control over who you hire. The corrupt republicans in the Senate vote Yes for anyone you want.
5651 2018-12-07 20:31:39 I have a couple of Arabian virgins who lather and oil mine every morning. 

Plus what you said.

5660 2018-12-07 20:30:56 What an eventful week!  $CAD employment numbers knock it out of the park partnered with a rally in $CL #CrudeOil send the CAD pairs moving.  OPEC curbs should boost Oil into next week.  $USDCAD $GBPCAD $EURCAD $CADCHF $CADJPY $NZDCAD $AUDCAD #Forex #FundamentalNews
5661 2018-12-07 20:30:45 Oil shale?
5662 2018-12-07 20:30:43 Makes sense. What would an oil exec know about global politics?
5663 2018-12-07 20:30:31 Short oil?
5664 2018-12-07 20:30:30 35% of QC oil comes from AB
It has displaced Algerian Oil, not Saudi oil. 
AB is freaking out and swinging at anyone because we're looking at a recession and oil demand is collapsing (in the face of massive US overproduction).
5665 2018-12-07 20:30:23 I've been converted to Marinara pizza and i'm getting obsessed with perfecting it (just sauce, garlic, oregano, olive oil, yum!). 
I'll eat most seafood (Mussels are a favourite) but tuna and salmon are past the point of being too fishy! Any meat is all good, bacon's best!
5666 2018-12-07 20:30:21 I don't see you cleaning a litter box, or putting oil in a car... Glad to see things are still looking up, gorgeousness!
5667 2018-12-07 20:30:12 Pretty sure he was chosen for the sanctions lift and his oil deals with Putin. Let’s not forget none of them are clean.
5668 2018-12-07 20:30:10 what do you think of Obama bragging to his patrons about how he fooled the left into providing tacit support for oil barons & Wall Street?
5669 2018-12-07 20:30:09 Whale oil be heading off in that case...
5670 2018-12-07 20:30:08 If pessimism was a commodity like oil, Philly would be OPEC.
5671 2018-12-07 20:30:05 Steal Norway's oil...oh wait they already have a country they do that to.
5672 2018-12-07 20:29:55 It’s a shame but that’s what the Uk or any other country would also do. No one risks damaging strong diplomatic ties with a wealthy trade-hub oil rich state where they have tens of thousands of expats. World leaders shouldve called dubai out on many counts but never did
5673 2018-12-07 20:29:55 I’m not water and olives are disgusting the only good thing that comes out of them is olive oil
5674 2018-12-07 20:29:55 thank you. tapi i tak boleh guna yang ada alkohol dengan mineral oil. Terus naik jerawat :(
5675 2018-12-07 20:29:47 400K bpd of refineries in QC but no social acceptability of oil?  C’mon
5676 2018-12-07 20:29:47 I’ve used cetaphil for a while and it never helped. I’m 95% sure it’s the oil and inner defense. I noticed a difference after using them for a couple of days. The vitamin C stick is optional but I think it really does help with the scars!
5677 2018-12-07 20:29:44 @BlaineHiggs making the argument for EE pipeline and the need to move oil to create jobs, $$ and prosperity for the entire country. #cndpoli
5678 2018-12-07 20:29:44 REX WAS THE FORMER CEO OF EXXON AND TRUMP/PUTIN/MBS HAD SOME OIL TO OWN IN RUSSIA.  REX WAS COZY WITH PUTIN, EVEN RECEIVED A BFF AWARD.  REX WAS GOING TO LET PUTIN DO WHATEVER HE WANTED TO GET OIL, CASH IN POCKETS, DONALD OWES PUTIN/MBS THIS FOR LOANED $$'S FOR TRUMP PROPERTIES
5679 2018-12-07 20:29:36 To be honest I don’t know. My bf got it for my pen and had already put it on. He didn’t even tell me it was CBD oil until I told him it wasn’t getting me high but I felt relaxed as fuck lmao I’ll try to see if I have the box b/c I’m curious which one he specifically got me.
5680 2018-12-07 20:29:36 Nobody was fooled by anything. Prop 112 was an asinine idea and would have virtually prohibited oil and gas exploration across the entire state. Much as you'd like to believe otherwise, renewables aren't there yet. We need oil & gas and will for the foreseeable future.
5681 2018-12-07 20:29:35 BITCH I GOT TEA TREE OIL IN MY EYE AND IM GOUNG BLING BUT I CBA TO GET UP AND WASH IT OUT
5682 2018-12-07 20:29:26 I always wondered why we had a fucking bong in the house and apparently my grandma gave it to us thinking it was to hold olive oil
5683 2018-12-07 20:29:26 I honestly hate having an expensive car every time I get an oil change it’s expensive ass oil also
5684 2018-12-07 20:29:21 It’s a good thing they tried to restrict $oil production today.
5685 2018-12-07 20:29:21 Ok? That’s why he ran the most powerful oil company in the world and you bankrupted many companies. Not to mention he’s one of the few original cabinet picks not indicted.
5686 2018-12-07 20:29:16 i've heard that term before too.  (my maga thought it was a good when DJT said we should just print more money based on this oil standard idea...)
5687 2018-12-07 20:29:09 So, just from those images. Replace wing/door. move numberplate down to the bottom, grills for oil coolers, ac compressor and radiator. strakes for the side, If it doesn't have it add the aux/usb adaptor
5688 2018-12-07 20:29:01 @WilliamDavisMD What is your take on hemp seeds and oil and the benefits or lack of? Specifically the Omegas 3&6 compared to fish oil? Debating with coworkers who live by your book like a Bible.
5689 2018-12-07 20:29:00 It’s still leaks oil today, correct? I have been to the memorial twice.  @RFL630 @POLIV411 @gbgary54 @Dstrang63 @randycrossFB
5690 2018-12-07 20:28:55 In a statement, Trump called Tillerson an “embodiment of the American Dream” and cited the oil executive’s “tenacity, broad experience and deep understanding of geopolitics.” Trump, however, made no mention of the nomination process in the announcement
5691 2018-12-07 20:28:55 I rub lavender oil on my temples & wrist every morning & it just helps me feel so calm & at peace. I absolutely love it 
5692 2018-12-07 20:28:49 man.. is there like a hair growth oil with results that appear in two days 
5693 2018-12-07 20:28:46 Justin has backtracked to include oil! Weakest Prime Minister ever!
5694 2018-12-07 20:28:44 Pretty sure it was Putin. He wanted to get the big oil deal that's been sitting idle for a couple of years moving.
Epic Fail.
5695 2018-12-07 20:28:37 @CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost @contessabrewer @michaelsantoli @JackieDeAngelis What does pulling 46billion barrels of oil do to the #USA landscape, a huge sinkhole? Any near #Yellowstone? #oil #wti
5696 2018-12-07 20:28:30 @JackOnSports perhaps a pinhole in the fuel line or oil line. If air gets in either it grows off the mixture and fouls plugs ... fishing hooks are usually the culprit
5697 2018-12-07 20:28:19 UPDATE: Metro motorcycle officer suffered broken arm after encountering some oil on ramp at Ellington and Trinity Lane. Officer expected to be okay.
5698 2018-12-07 20:28:01 Betsy took my car and got the oil changed without me knowing....she truly is an angel and I don’t deserve her 
5699 2018-12-07 20:27:45 100%! haven't gotten blowback from a Jacobin piece I posted last week, "Tulsi Gabbard Is Not Your Friend" *phew!* & I don't typically engage in arguments on the left,
but I rt'd a list of big oil recipients. Beto was #2. I was trashed, name called. 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ truth ain't sweet.
5700 2018-12-07 20:27:44 Eucalyptus and tea tree oil, add to infuser and deep breaths!  Take care!!!
5701 2018-12-07 20:27:44 I think that this has to be authenticated, though I would not be surprised.  He knows Tillerson was there about the oil and #RexTillerson couldn't see how it would work out under this KKKlown. #TrumpIsTheEnemyOfThePeople
5702 2018-12-07 20:27:37 He took thousands of dollars from the oil and gas industry. I'm sorry we wont humans to continue living on the planet
5703 2018-12-07 20:27:35 I absolutely adored the one landscape picture you did, I love everything about your art and it makes me wish I was better at something other then edible art.
5704 2018-12-07 20:27:22 REX TILLERSON, WAS SUPPOSED TO TRAVEL TO KENYA,HE THEN ENTERED ASOROCK PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE OF CROOKED PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA FOR OIL DEAL WITHOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP APPROVAL AND HE WAS FIRED THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR TAKEN THE BULL BY THE HORNS
5705 2018-12-07 20:27:19 I owned one truck with a Cummins, never ever again.  Fill ‘er up with oil and check the fuel.
5706 2018-12-07 20:27:12 McCarthy's base is Big Oil and I don't think he's well connected to most other CA R's.  The Tea Party types seem to have control of the state party structure and Kevin's just a go along kind of guy, not really a leader. But he loves to push FEAR.
5707 2018-12-07 20:27:07 Oil prices rising soon!
5708 2018-12-07 20:27:06  The former CEO of one of the world’s biggest oil companies though?
5709 2018-12-07 20:26:57 Tillerson just successfully ran one of the largest oil companies in the world, something you’ve never accomplished. Your yes men don’t do America any favors.
5710 2018-12-07 20:26:57 If Fallout's art style was the 50s vision of the future brought to ruin, Outer Worlds' is the future crammed through wild west-era snake oil ads. It's rad and seems to reinforce the narrative themes
5711 2018-12-07 20:26:57 So does that mean no war in the middle east and troops get to come back home to their family great no more Saudi oil.
5712 2018-12-07 20:26:56 driving up to the mountains today to start my new job; making oil and processing weed. $5 more dollars + many more benefits.
5713 2018-12-07 20:26:38 Government knew about that forever just did not use it better to drain others oil then use our own.
5714 2018-12-07 20:26:36 Only in America can someone "dumb as a rock" rise to the CEO level of Exxon, a multi-bazillion dollar oil company.
5715 2018-12-07 20:26:29 Depends when peak oil happens. 
I dont think any oil analyst would claim we can maintain current production levels as far out as 2100
5716 2018-12-07 20:26:29 Wow. This kind of talk belongs nowhere. Children have more respect for one another than this. Pres T - Rex Tillerson was CEO of a major oil company for a number of years. I’m pretty sure his metal capacity far outweighs yours. You’re the one we can’t get rid of fast enough...
5717 2018-12-07 20:26:26 An oil CEO is a globalist? Lmfao..
5718 2018-12-07 20:26:25 From 2016 In an interview Fox News Sunday, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Tillerson, saying:  "He's a world-class player. He's in charge of an oil company that's pretty much double the size of its next nearest competitor." 
Guess you where wrong skippy.
5719 2018-12-07 20:26:24 Wow.  Pretty much pegged Big Oil management
5720 2018-12-07 20:26:20 Rose to the top in a global oil company rather than being appointed by daddy.
5721 2018-12-07 20:26:19 A reminder that Rex Tillerson left his job as CEO of the largest oil company in the world, making more than $25 million a year, to serve as America's top diplomat
5722 2018-12-07 20:26:10 You don’t get to be CEO of an oil giant by being lazy as hell.
5723 2018-12-07 20:26:08 Can you explain why the sharp narrowing in the wti-wcs differential has not been reflected in Cdn oil stock prices??  Even in $ terms wcs is now much higher in past week.
5724 2018-12-07 20:26:08 I hate waiting for oil changes lol
5725 2018-12-07 20:26:03 Maybe you do read.
America does too. 
You're losing allies all over the world.
Saudis raising oil prices.
N.Korea gleefully nuking your gestures.
China winning Big
Companies leaving trump tariff country...
Yeah. Winning.
Who can you attack today besides Mueller, Comey,Tillerson?
5726 2018-12-07 20:25:48 I get it we won’t always like everything our government does. Fracking has been allowed for years and helped lower oil costs dramatically but has polluted our water dramatically. What has the EPA done about it? Progress needs to be made in many areas.
5727 2018-12-07 20:25:40 Stupid guy running the largest oil company in the world! Am I right? lol. 

(He said MEAN things!)
(He has more $$$!!)
(He can read!!!)

#DiaperDon #ThanksGOP #Kakistocracy
5728 2018-12-07 20:25:38 Imma go get my oil changed today lmfao about that time
5729 2018-12-07 20:25:38 yes because the need is to go to renewable fuels not crude oil.
5730 2018-12-07 20:25:32 Rex Tillerson has much to hide! Mueller must investigate him! He attempted the biggest oil deal of his career between Russia and Exxon. Next trump hired him and Rex tried to lift sanctions. Putin certainly promised him a huge payday if he got the oil deal done!
5731 2018-12-07 20:25:31 Oil and footjobs!
5732 2018-12-07 20:25:22 There are a bunch of fish in the sea. But there’s also trash, oil, & other shit that can hurt you. 

I’m gonna stick to my fishy.. 
5733 2018-12-07 20:25:17 Plant/seed oil is very healthy. Please buy olive oil or marula oil for your home.
5734 2018-12-07 20:25:14 Houston Alumni loaded with oil cash. Best get a loan ASAP.
5735 2018-12-07 20:25:08 coconut oil is a lifesaver man
5736 2018-12-07 20:24:59 Oil is where it’s at honestly
5737 2018-12-07 20:24:55 Black castor oil 
5738 2018-12-07 20:24:40 Yes. Dumb as a rock. Ran the largest and most successful oil company in the world and one of the most respected CEOs of all time .
5739 2018-12-07 20:24:40 Of all the insults one might want to hurl at a man who ran Exxon oil for 11 years, “dumb as a rock” seems pretty much absurd. But yeah, the tweets are getting more and more unhinged — hard not to assume Mueller is indeed coming
5740 2018-12-07 20:24:29 which kind has oil
5741 2018-12-07 20:24:29 It is a good deal for American shale oil producers
5742 2018-12-07 20:24:14 The Pouring Of The Expensive Oil On Christ Has Helped The Poor More Than Selling It To Give The Money To The Poor Would
5743 2018-12-07 20:24:12 A well designed carbon tax could accomplish this goal....assuming foreign oil really is dirtier.
5744 2018-12-07 20:24:03 So, if India buys Iranian oil, will the Administration arrest officials from India?
5745 2018-12-07 20:24:02 Like throwin oil on a fire 
5746 2018-12-07 20:23:55 Stocks are up just over 25% since election night.. Oil is down over 30% since the peak in beginning of October and fell below $50 a barrel for first time in over a year just a week ago... tf you talking bout bruh
5747 2018-12-07 20:23:53 Still long #Oil having a good day but could of been better. Long #es as well
5748 2018-12-07 20:23:50 Wow glad your an oil painting saying that  yeah okay bring pics up from 11yrs ago.......
5749 2018-12-07 20:23:48 Bahahaha -I cant help but laugh- ya ain’t no fucking oil painting yourself! What do you give the chicks to sleep with ya these days? It’s that or a pity fuck!! Cause ya ain’t got shit going for ya! The partying and drugs took its toll.. -putting a sorrowful pout on my face- aww >
5750 2018-12-07 20:23:38 Thank U brother, I have said this many times, that Chiefs has out grown the Motaunges, therefore they need to sell it...they can't grow the brand anymore, some oil reach tycoon from middle East should come and buy it, then U will the brand being rejuvenated.
5751 2018-12-07 20:23:32 Well Tillerson got that sweet oil deal from Russia and then bailed so he's smarter then about 90 percent of Trumps cabinet but is still a crook and traitor
5752 2018-12-07 20:23:30 So full of shit. Do you know or do you even care that one ship a load of 2 million barrels of oil produced 100,000 tons of CO2.
No because it’s not on your agenda liberals liberals and NDP are pathetic pieces of crap Ola
5753 2018-12-07 20:23:25 How can you possibly fuck up an oil change lol.
5754 2018-12-07 20:23:17 Never before in history has a former oil executive been seen as a sympathetic figure.  And it likely won't happen again anytime soon #Tillerson
5755 2018-12-07 20:23:03 First, SHELL got an exemption. This is just the beginning. All the big oil companies and big businesses generally support a carbon tax, because THEY WON'T BE PAYING IT.
5756 2018-12-07 20:23:02 Bill Kristol getting ink all over himself in a rush to put her on the last cover of The Weekly Standard before it folds
5757 2018-12-07 20:23:02 You got off easy. I had to change the oil and rotate all 4 tires before my dad would let me take my car anywhere.
5758 2018-12-07 20:23:02 AND he loses $180M if he decides to go back into the oil business until like 2030
5759 2018-12-07 20:22:58 I went there years ago. The thing that struck me was the droplets of oil, oozing to the surface of the water, like tears. I remember that and grown men openly crying.
5760 2018-12-07 20:22:50 Hmmm! If as you say  Tillerson is as 'dumb as a rock' then how come he was in charge of one of the world's largest oil and gas companies making huge profits for its shareholders. Trump, I'll say this for you. You are a shit at everything in life apart from

NAME CALLING
5761 2018-12-07 20:22:49 THE OLIVE OIL LEMON CUPCAKE FROM FLOWER CHILD IS SO BOMB!!!!!!!!
5762 2018-12-07 20:22:44 Burning oil everywhere on the water...
5763 2018-12-07 20:22:42 You know you’re going to eat well when the air smells like truffle oil and @PastaeBastaLndn are cooking up a storm! #ChristmasCarolsWithATwist  
5764 2018-12-07 20:22:31 How does he feel about oil money in transfer payments?
5765 2018-12-07 20:22:27 I’m so proud I got my oil changed lol
5766 2018-12-07 20:22:25 This is why I am so pleased Rachel Notley is throttling back.  Thousands of oil workers including my family have suffered enough in past 3 years.
5767 2018-12-07 20:22:24 Normally roads comprise around 90% rocks, limestone, sand and upto 10% bitumen(asphalt) to bind it. Bitumen is extracted form crude oil. Pellets made from house hold or commercial plastic waste(which are destined to landfills) can be used as a replacement for bitumen.
5768 2018-12-07 20:22:24 Liberals just plain lied.They talk a great line but do the wrong things on #ClimateChange Subsidies not cancelled. Buy a pipeline & promote oil & nothing for renewables. I will NEVER vote for either of these parties again. Need action NOW or our kids will curse us! #gpc #bcpoli
5769 2018-12-07 20:22:23 100% agree.  Engine noise in stations getting worse. Those suburban railcars r in desperate need of a refurbishment. But I gather Irish Rail have no plans, just basic oil changes and fix broken parts. I fear we will start 2c increasing breakdowns. Completely predictable. 
5770 2018-12-07 20:22:17 REX TILLERSON, IS A DISGRACE TO GREAT AMERICAN, REX TILLERSON SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR BETRAYED PRESIDENT TRUMP , HE CONSPIRED WITH THE CROOKED PRESIDENT JUBRIL ALSUDANI THE IMPOSTER PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA A SUDANESE TO PLAN TO THIEF NIGERIA OIL IN THE NAME OFUSA
5771 2018-12-07 20:22:12 Its very possible when you consider all the corporate welfare we give to companies who dont need it and cant just move out of the country like oil companies that cant move bc they drill in the USA. Or all the increased funding to military contractors for no reason. How about the
5772 2018-12-07 20:22:01 OPEC reduces oil output. Kelly talks to Mueller. Today, you should be remembering Pearl Harbor. No one as lazy or stupidly moronic as trump.
5773 2018-12-07 20:21:58 If you go on your Snapchat map and look at Nigeria’s oil depot fire, insane 
5774 2018-12-07 20:21:55 It’s amazing the Texas bowl gets relegated to 2 6-6 teams oil money is something
5775 2018-12-07 20:21:52 Just a thought... if Tillerson came into the picture because of Putin (Exxon oil deal), and Putin is now ok with media Trump bashing; is that the key to Rex now talking? #TrumpRussia
5776 2018-12-07 20:21:46 @PMOIndia Thanks to pmo/modiji for paying of oil bought from iran in rupay not in $(अमेरिकी दवाब को PM मोदी ने किया नजरअंदाज| Bharat Tak)
5777 2018-12-07 20:21:36 No I’m gonna try using oil
5778 2018-12-07 20:21:30 It appears to be linked to the Grand Alaskan/Arctic-Exxon/Russkie Oil misadventure before the Magnitsky Act in 2012.
5779 2018-12-07 20:21:23 In addition, there is a lagging effect in this.  Inflation has actually turned more negative this year from this report due to massive oil price drop and health care costs being lower than anticipated.
5780 2018-12-07 20:21:17 i sure would’ve got on the highway today when i get off but i need my oil change, glad my appointment in the morning.
5781 2018-12-07 20:21:13 #Qatar announced its' departure from OPEC. Represented 2% of OPEC's crude oil output in 2017. Will focus on LNG
Ecuador, Gabon, & Indonesia all had unilaterally left, only to return. Indonesia renounced its membership in 2009, rejoined in 2016, only to  step down again late 2016
5782 2018-12-07 20:21:13 You do realize that if someone operates a gas pump at a service station and donates $5 to Beto, that is money from the "oil and gas industry", right?
5783 2018-12-07 20:21:10 Just wait until he tells on you the Russian oil fields ,Rosneft the 19 billion he's going to tell.
5784 2018-12-07 20:21:09 Yeah look by like the Other oil and the Asian/Hispanic aisle
5785 2018-12-07 20:21:08 Tillerson is no boy scout he knew Russia was involved somehow and he knows Putin wanted that oil
5786 2018-12-07 20:21:03 Baby oil is fab
5787 2018-12-07 20:20:56 Reality is if you get rid of oil right now you will also cause cataclysm.
Plus canada is already colder than the moon some days how much colder can it really get ? Lol thanks for being cival. But i have to go back to work!
5788 2018-12-07 20:20:54 Are they frozen or fresh try them in a pan with teenie bit of oil  xxx
5789 2018-12-07 20:20:50 I guess in the 70s you sold your car and started riding a bicycle because the scientists then said oil was running out. Then in the 80s you stocked up on polar equipment to get ready for the ice age coming. For some reason you can't conceive the idea scientists can be wrong
5790 2018-12-07 20:20:48 Seriously Tillerson can buy and sell Trump. He ran a giant oil company. Who does he think he is going to war with? Did he not watch Syriana?
5791 2018-12-07 20:20:47 The US is now the biggest oil producer in the world, slightly ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. This should entail that the US determines the price. Trump must blame his supporters, the US oil companies, before blaming OPEC. (All three around 11 m bbls)
5792 2018-12-07 20:20:41 There was no butter. Or salt or oil. Just plain boiled broccoli
5793 2018-12-07 20:20:40 How much time do I have to buy another car after my oil light comes on?
5794 2018-12-07 20:20:36 Whoa! so much for the civility and good vibes out of the Bush funeral. So Presidential.. nobody gets to the leadership of a major oil company being ''dumb as a rock'' now Trump organization, that's a different story!
5795 2018-12-07 20:20:35 Not a good sign.  Tie this in with Copper, Lumber & Oil and you can see why the stock markets are in turmoil.  And for those that don't know, it too is a leading indicator.
5796 2018-12-07 20:20:35 Edward Jones Dome (St. Louis Rams), Soldier Field, Lucas Oil Stadium and Aarowhead Stadium.
5797 2018-12-07 20:20:29 (3/n) moreover, as car ownership goes down, we get more and more space on the roads per individual and it would ideally reduce the distance travelled by an individual in traffic and precious time and oil could be saved there.
5798 2018-12-07 20:20:27 Same! I got my sesame oil from the Asian market
5799 2018-12-07 20:20:18 Rex is not dumb and left the administration still in tact. He made a lot of money in the oil industry and I'm sure worked his ass off, unlike Trump the free loader.
5800 2018-12-07 20:20:18 Oil-based cleanser like Clinique’s Take the Day Off Cleansing Oil. X
5801 2018-12-07 20:20:13 “He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell." The President of the United States on a former oil company executive turned Cabinet secretary.

5803 2018-12-07 20:20:06 I know right!? The OIL guy being all ethical!!!??
5804 2018-12-07 20:20:01 Ah Kay I’m not really sure what’s going on kinda tuned out after I found out they where rioting over oil prices didn’t know if something changed
5805 2018-12-07 20:19:57 That's twice today I've seen Trump being referenced negatively when the content had nothing to do with him. A petition about Palm Oil and a Michael Jackson worst to best songs list. Also cunts who can't review something without rambling about irrelevant shit shouldn't write.
5806 2018-12-07 20:19:56 Maybe new replacement and green technologies which were bought and suppressed by oil companies can now come out of hiding so filthy oil can be replaced and future generations can live on a planet which can survive
5807 2018-12-07 20:19:42 Maybe new replacement and green technologies which were bought and suppressed by oil companies can now come out of hiding so filthy oil can be replaced and future generations can live on a planet which can survive

Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
5809 2018-12-07 20:19:19 Lies, lies and more lies! JT wants to kill the oil industry in Canada regardless of how it affects westerners. We are not real Canadians in his eyes. Time to find an exit before it's too late....
5810 2018-12-07 20:19:02 Merchants will argue that gas is the main energy input for fertiliser production so the price of oil doesn't really matter. Find it hard to believe.
5811 2018-12-07 20:19:01 Putin needs oil prices high to keep his budget balanced. He enlisted agent trump to disrupt the alternative energy progress to increase dependence on oil. Higher prices make trump’s boss happy. Can we get the vile trump out of office before he destroys the planet. Please.
5812 2018-12-07 20:19:00 Only if he wants $70 oil changes and $80 each week for fuel

5814 2018-12-07 20:18:41 What!? Dont lie to the people. These numbers will collapse over the coming months because of the complete decimation  of the oil industry and slowdown in the auto sector. 

The TSX is down 8.89% YTD and the CAD is getting crushed.
5815 2018-12-07 20:18:39 This economy got me contemplating working at the oil rigs
5816 2018-12-07 20:18:35 You literally sell snake oil to cancer patients.

Big man.
5817 2018-12-07 20:18:33 You need a job stock market going down, China thing, oil prices and GM lay offs. You should be to busy for twitter.  But you don't care because it is not you. What I think you taking the market down to buy stock low inside trader.
5818 2018-12-07 20:18:29 Lol coming from the highly disciplined oil industry
5819 2018-12-07 20:18:28 Oil company executives should NEVER be trusted.
5820 2018-12-07 20:18:28 love to see oil company CEOs embarrassed and humiliated, no matter who does it.
5821 2018-12-07 20:18:26 Is it weird that I want to see the billionaire oil man land safely on his feet?
5822 2018-12-07 20:18:12 I'd rather see a slow and steady rise in oil, rather than a rip your head off rally, more sustainable, and less likey to piss Trump off!!#OOTT
5823 2018-12-07 20:18:07 I will try ! x
5824 2018-12-07 20:18:06 Charles Koch propaganda network? Who wouldn't be a "Libertarian" if you inherited a $350,000,000.00 Oil Refinery at birth?
5825 2018-12-07 20:17:56 Try broiled flounder topped with broccoli rabe with garlic and olive oil, and a favorite vegetable side or two. Swap potato for quinoa. Add a salad. #WhatsForDinner #HealthyDiet #HealthyLiving #HINO2018
5826 2018-12-07 20:17:55 I have 5 free oil changes left best believe I’m gonna use all those bitchs 
5827 2018-12-07 20:17:53 So, everyone is gonna focus on Trump calling Tillerson "dumb as a rock." What we should be talking about here is how Trump picked an oil CEO as Secretary of State, and is letting Saudi oil dictate whether or not it's okay to kill a journalist.  That's the real norms violation.
5828 2018-12-07 20:17:50 It's like Dubya bankrupting an oil company ... in Texas.  WTF?
5829 2018-12-07 20:17:32 Even big oil gets a pass...if you can take a limp jab at Trump...
I see.
5830 2018-12-07 20:17:29 Then they should ban oil products and all imports immediately - just in time for Winter. They can rewrite the word to say “Baby it’s cold inside”
5831 2018-12-07 20:17:23 She probably rubbed you with some holy oil in your sleep
5832 2018-12-07 20:17:16 Oh okay yeah. I joined after that but too many ties to oil I guess
5833 2018-12-07 20:17:13 Yes. Hope you have something special planned for the 100th tanker, 3rd commercial layer, HH2 spud etc etc. Much to look forward to
5834 2018-12-07 20:17:12 Peppermint oil to massage could also help! And drink some tea ! I do recommend mint or ginger but something else would work too!
5835 2018-12-07 20:17:11 Rex is not a dog.Rex was a oil man who became a rock by talking to the rocks in the oilfields.
5836 2018-12-07 20:17:10 Tillerson loved that sweet Russian oil deal - so a traitor calls about another traitor  big whoops
5837 2018-12-07 20:17:06 Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. Bad Cholesterol LDL
5838 2018-12-07 20:17:02 OPEC, Russia agree to slash oil output despite Trump pressureAry
5839 2018-12-07 20:16:54 The only thing is castor oil stains. So idk how I’m going to sleep without my eyebrows touching the pillow lmao
5840 2018-12-07 20:16:49 si le prix du pétrole chute encore, cela fera moins d'argent dans les caisses de l'Etat
et cela montrera une chute de l'activité économique.
5841 2018-12-07 20:16:44 Manhattan's Upper West Side, sometimes known as the Upper Left Side sounds rich. Y'all vote for murderers who supply arms to human rights abusers as long as they have oil and let corporations avoid tax as long as they're you. Bernie ain't for those evil scumbags, it's cool x
5842 2018-12-07 20:16:39 Besides  don't think I could stand all the oil leaks
5843 2018-12-07 20:16:38 After seeing the Tillerson tweet, guessing the #oil one is going to be one for the record books.
5844 2018-12-07 20:16:37 I feel like the Matrix is poking fun at us and being way too obvious naming an oil tycoon T, Rex.
5845 2018-12-07 20:16:32 Huh, so apparently snake oil isn't a nickname for lube
5846 2018-12-07 20:16:29 Stock market wrapped up on that arrest and oil prices. Big big down day. And not good the past few weeks.  All the tax cuts are being overshadowed by the huge losses in the stock markets.
5847 2018-12-07 20:16:25 I'm one of your supporters. My question Mr. President is how does someone like Mr. Tillerson rise to be CEO of the largest oil company (ExxonMobil) if they are "dumb as a rock and don't have the mental capacity needed?"  Last I checked, ExxonMobil makes money; we have deficits.
5848 2018-12-07 20:16:24 Rex violated our sanctions against Russia trying to broker his biggest oil deal ever between Russia + @exxonmobil He failed so trump put him in our White House to try to lift sanctions_He was fired while shyting on a toilet because he failed again, Putin + trump were pissed!
5849 2018-12-07 20:16:24 He was literally just there to negotiate the sanctions relief and the new oil deals in Siberia
5850 2018-12-07 20:16:22 this is rubbish get some real work for those "Progressive candidate" of yours. She do not know what she is talking about. In 16-centuries Themsen (London) was frozen. Later it was growing warming and without any OIL and CO2. #USA #Trump
5851 2018-12-07 20:16:18 Nymex Settles 12/7/18 - CL Jan19: 52.61 (+1.12) (+3.3% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
5852 2018-12-07 20:16:18 Is this even normal????? The guy led one of the biggest oil companies in the world , while you’re companies declared bankruptcy 6 times....who is dumber than a rock????? Not even mentioning that u claim to hire the very best and brightest people.....you interviewed and hired him.
5853 2018-12-07 20:16:16 Have given up on football and now spend most days painting engine oil on my butt.

5855 2018-12-07 20:16:13 I would be less worried about the future if we'd elected an infected bottle of oil to the highest office in the land
5856 2018-12-07 20:16:06 I think this is the one time our president is telling the truth. Of course an oil CEO would be dumb and lazy
5857 2018-12-07 20:16:06 yes!!  this shouldn't just be a "whoops, guess we got fooled" moment, it should be a "time to re-evaluate every assumption that got us here" moment. when he's bragging to Wall Street & oil barons about how well he fooled us, that's not just "policy disagreement" or "a mistake"
5858 2018-12-07 20:16:01 We're Chelsea or City any better placed than Newcastle before oil investment monies. No coincidence both clubs have lost their soul now success have come their way. #moneycantbuyyoulove
5859 2018-12-07 20:16:01 somehow DJT makes me feel bad for an oil exec.
5860 2018-12-07 20:15:56 You don’t drive oil on tax payer roads, you drive polluting internal combustion engine vehicles.  Stop demand of fossil fuels & fossil fuels go away. Simple! Hydrogen fuel cells can replace the internal combustion engine

5861 2018-12-07 20:15:53 so far today I've read some Nietzsche, made the intro music for my future podcast, bought a beginner oil painting set, dedicated my life to oil painting, become disillusioned with oil painting, and given up oil painting, and it isn't even lunch time yet.
5862 2018-12-07 20:15:51 ummm my po jus did a house search n thought the face oil samples on my table was pcp.......... lmao
5863 2018-12-07 20:15:32 Wow! This garbage talk is coming from the President of the U.S! Just when you think Trump can't go any lower. BTW, Rex Tillerson was the CEO of one of the world's largest oil companies. You bankrupted your family business multiple times after being given millions from your Daddy.
5864 2018-12-07 20:15:31 Katie Bill C-69 is an absolute disaster for our energy industry which already overly regulated & taxed. Not globally competitive & result is massive loss of capital & high unemployment in Alberta while we continue to import disgraceful oil from Saudi Arabia #cdnpoli @fordnation

5866 2018-12-07 20:15:26 I think what you meant to say was “in case you missed it we will not be destroying these states for oil companies profits but investing in renewables” isn’t your job literally to protect the environment? WTF Zinke? #keepitintheground
5867 2018-12-07 20:15:25 Refuse to believe Tillerson is dumb. You don’t become the CEO of the largest Oil company in the world by being dumb.
5868 2018-12-07 20:15:25 @RealRealDonaldT Quote:  'Paris is putting us out of business'....Animal
Sanctuaries being destroyed for oil hunting.   Putin glad for ice caps
melting....opens up new shipping routes.  CEO's only working for their
shareholders.   What's wrong with you folks?
5869 2018-12-07 20:15:19 You’re not wrong. But I will never agree that the solution is continuing with oil. Honestly, I believe that way of thinking is why we’ve gotten nowhere on climate change and why it’s predicted we will face a cataclysm in 30 years. To avoid that we have to change everything.

Appreciated.
5874 2018-12-07 20:15:04 @OPECSecretariat This 15 member committee is nothing more than 15 voted in leaders from around the world to dictate and manipulate world oil prices for self greed of any 1 country. More or less to FEED the RICH and STARVE the POOR. Oil prices should not be driven by a committee
5875 2018-12-07 20:15:03 Isn't Tillerson a billionaire oil guy?

5880 2018-12-07 20:14:38 US has a lot of oil underground, gas, minerals, more.  Our water is probably of greatest interest to China, after Gold? We can disconnect from foreign oil and depend on ourselves as we move toward FREE ENERGY (Tesla, Nikola).
5881 2018-12-07 20:14:37 HAHA! I do have peppermint oil on deck! 
5882 2018-12-07 20:14:35 It will be all transgender men, like all women's sports
5883 2018-12-07 20:14:24 I love how Rex Tillerson, fucking evil oil CEO incarnate, was quite polite about Trump apart from saying 'He kept trying to make me do crimes and i didn't want to do crimes' which is enough for Trump to start doing the trip over his own dick routine.
5884 2018-12-07 20:14:22 Bull shit. What’s going to happen when all the oil is gone because it is a finite supply. Big Oil and Gas doesn’t want to find a solution, so they pay off the GOP so that no one finds a solution. There are solutions.  Electric is a start. Even hybrids are better.
5885 2018-12-07 20:14:17 What do Quebecers use to heat their home and drive their cars?  Saudi oil is tainted by a multitude of human rights atrocities....I guess killing gays and women is okay, but having the MOST regulated oil and gas industry in the world is not
5886 2018-12-07 20:14:15 Yes, Trump, think of your children, grandchildren & their children, they will have to live with the mess you make. You'll be pushing up daisies, but they will have to breath the polluted air you leave behind! COAL & OIL ARE DIRTY! @SenateGOP @GOP
5887 2018-12-07 20:14:13 Is Cod Liver Oil = Fish Oil?
5888 2018-12-07 20:14:11 Lol, there’s been far more money in fossil fuels. Which is why I founded two oil exploration companies. It was easy money.
5889 2018-12-07 20:14:10 Putin +trump were so pissed Rex was fired while shyting on a toilet. Remember Rex violated our sanctions against Russia trying to broker his biggest oil deal ever between Russia and @exxonmobil  he failed. Then trump hired him to lift sanctions, failed at getting deal done again!
5890 2018-12-07 20:14:10 wanted: ceo for largest oil corporation.

5891 2018-12-07 20:14:09 omg sis you're sooooo young
is all that 2 liters of water a day? moisturizer or coconut oil? I know you're rich and clearly did not botox or plastic surgeries

YA FUCKING SURE?!? 
5897 2018-12-07 20:13:49 @MSNBC @FoxNews talk about dumb as hell and lazy. Does trump think we don’t know Tillerson was appointed to hopefully progress an oil deal for the Russians? Quid pro quo? Or that he is the golfer in chief at HIS golf clubs wasting OUR tax dollars?
5898 2018-12-07 20:13:47 1■The yom Kippur war is a good place to start Alex, because of Nixon, another damn fine republican president, OPEC responded by increasing a barrell of oil from $3.50 to $15. Thus causing mass inflation in the western economy. Killing the major economic influence of the time.
5899 2018-12-07 20:13:46 Come on, man. No one buys this. He was the CEO of Exxon. Comparatively speaking, you are the CEO of a popsicle cart. 

And now you’ve gone and made me defend an oil executive.
5900 2018-12-07 20:13:46 Need two new tires, my windshield fixed, an oil change and tint. New car me 
5901 2018-12-07 20:13:43 Olive again oil!
5902 2018-12-07 20:13:39 He was head of a successful oil giant. No bankruptcies. Nuf said.
5903 2018-12-07 20:13:35 Correction: CBD flower, not oil. I'm still learning. So many new things are available. I'm an old school stoner, and had quit for the past few years. Just started back up, I'm in awe of what is out there.   

Need a book, New Age Marijuana for Dummies.
5904 2018-12-07 20:13:34 Somebody teach me how to do my own oil change damnit
5905 2018-12-07 20:13:23 You are plenty quick to blow all kinds of wind here.

Let me ask you this ;( I don't expect any knowledgeable reply )
What part of the Bush family oil business did George Bush Sr. or Jr. surrender from while either one of them was president?

Hint;
Neither one of them.
5906 2018-12-07 20:13:21 Jamaica black castor oil at nights boo
5907 2018-12-07 20:13:13 I set a plastic jug of oil on a flat top grill and plastic just doesn’t like that, nor does oil.
5908 2018-12-07 20:13:11 The only way the feds will see a ROI on Transmountain is if they double down and invest in a refinery to turn shipment from dilbit to oil.  That would resolve the environmental concerns.
5909 2018-12-07 20:12:57 Not sure what you mean by “oil standard”. As far as I know, that’s not a thing. Our currency is not a commodity-backed currency; it’s the opposite. However, oil is priced in $US for convenience bc  is the ’s reserve currency &  is largest consumer, 3rd largest producer.
5910 2018-12-07 20:12:56 God damn, dude. Only 10 more boys away until we get to our next milestone! This shit is so insane I am going to take a shower!! Epic gamer moment right there.
5911 2018-12-07 20:12:55 I just came here for an oil change and honestly I’m feeling so attacked rn 
5912 2018-12-07 20:12:48 For the unnecessary wars with oil countries to drum up more blood and oil just to line his families wallets.
5913 2018-12-07 20:12:48 All I know is Trump didn’t meet him till he hired him. If sanctions are removed there is a fortune to be made in an oil project. Trump just insulted him. He did not get where he was being stupid. He is much smarter than Trump.
5914 2018-12-07 20:12:46 Tillerson was a total globalist looking for his own millions in oil....
5915 2018-12-07 20:12:44 Agreed! Totally out of touch with reality. Every single one of them utilize products and services that, at some point, would have been the result of oil and gas. The hypocrisy is sickening. Change starts with one - so go ahead and start, until then #STFU.
5916 2018-12-07 20:12:40 In maldives we use coconut oil a lot
5917 2018-12-07 20:12:39 A man knows who his heart belongs to. So you can cook his food with Diamond oil & do backflips on his dick but if it ain't you, it ain't you,
5918 2018-12-07 20:12:38 That's your choice but there are a lot of us who won't drink the raw sewage from some Goldman Sachs, Wall Street, Big Oil backed elites who don't push hard for a #GreenNewDeal #MedicareForAll & #AffordableCollege
5919 2018-12-07 20:12:32 Notley's goal is to reduce Alberta oil consumption so the Liberals can kill off the industry.

Neither Alberta NDP or the federal Libs intend to help the oil industry.
5920 2018-12-07 20:12:31 Despite your disdain for Musk, it's becoming apparent to me that oil as a fuel has seen peak use.  Throw in tech advances in finding and extracting it, and petro's days as king are done.  IMO

5925 2018-12-07 20:12:06 Is financial PTSD a thing? Cause every time I get an oil change I just assume my car is broken and I am absolutely leaving with  $1000 in  suggested repairs.
5926 2018-12-07 20:12:04 Because he liked the support of the oil lobby
5927 2018-12-07 20:11:59 Guns & oil are not bad things. But your take here & your grammar skills ARE bad things. Yikes
5928 2018-12-07 20:11:52 Hilarious. You hire people like Rex - who ran a MAJOR oil & has company. Brag about him and now you call him dumb?  #BeBest   Isn’t that your wife’s thing? @FLOTUS
5929 2018-12-07 20:11:48 Hopefully they won’t use so much or any palm oil in theirs
5930 2018-12-07 20:11:47 Just remove the "what if". US foreign policy has been bought for a LOOOOOONG time, be it from

Be it Saudi Arabia, Oil companies, Defense Contractors, The banks, etc
5931 2018-12-07 20:11:47 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
5932 2018-12-07 20:11:42 dylan was just a hilarious oil rig worker before a librarian came into their life. plot twist: a late night show host is involved. said to be jeff bridges's best role yet.
5933 2018-12-07 20:11:40 Stocks are going down oil is going up
5934 2018-12-07 20:11:35 He who controls the pipelines & rail cars controls the flow of oil to tidewater. I do not trust PMJT or even Rachel Notley much for that matter.
5935 2018-12-07 20:11:34 Oh wow... that's really strange. Clear it out with a shot of peppermint essential oil up your nose? X-D
5936 2018-12-07 20:11:33 Yup, just when North America is having Winter? Gives big oil another fake excuse to raise prices.
5937 2018-12-07 20:11:27 Tillerson promised Putin he would open the arctic to oil drilling.
5938 2018-12-07 20:11:22 Today’s tracks are tomorrow’s trails, and the next day’s paved roadways.  Except asphalt is an oil byproduct, and without oil on Mars, we’ll need to build roads out of other native materials.
5939 2018-12-07 20:11:10 can't believe trump would tweet this.the oil companys will be pissed about trump saying this about one of their own.
5940 2018-12-07 20:11:10 Buddy. Where does the US get its oil from? Fracking? Nope. This is about money for big oil and gas. Fracking is NOT safe.
5941 2018-12-07 20:11:09 Why hasn't the left attacked Obama? Simple. 

He redeemed himself by transforming America to a cop-hating, oil & coal restricting, bank demonizing, white-diminishing, justice-biased, open border, military-reducing, nanny-state country.

5943 2018-12-07 20:11:03 Anybody in Hattiesburg need an oil change?
5944 2018-12-07 20:11:02 No way! Tulsa
Big Oil needs my help.
5945 2018-12-07 20:11:01 Rex violated our sanctions against Russia trying to broker his biggest oil deal ever between Russia+ @exxonmobil When he failed Putin and trump put him in our White House to let him try to lift sanctions_fired while shyting on a toilet after failing again, Putin+trump were pissed
5946 2018-12-07 20:10:50 OBAMY WAS HELPING OUT HIS MUSLIMS FRIENDS IN THE MID EAST BY KEEPING US DEPENDENT ON THEIR OIL
5947 2018-12-07 20:10:34 @jasonrapert nailing it on how the entire medical mj is really about being able to smoke it when they want. Not necessarily cbd oil.  Asking why in 30 yrs hasn’t there really been good science reality
5948 2018-12-07 20:10:23 Unlike the billions in subsidies that the fossil fuel industry gets every year for things like oil and gas exploration and development, in a addition to a bunch of others?
5949 2018-12-07 20:10:13 Need 8-10 more of these guys then we’ll be cooking with mama’s peanut oil
5950 2018-12-07 20:10:11 wtf I love big oil now
5951 2018-12-07 20:10:08 donald trump is the best thing to happen to the public image of oil executives and old guard republicans
5952 2018-12-07 20:10:04 its really sad that my diamonds are being sold in stores and Frank Calder and Garvin lizotte  are reaping the rewards of my resources and all that is being done is the markets for oil are going down making Alberta rich by stealing my diamonds while my people are being rippedoff

5954 2018-12-07 20:09:46 This is not a crisis,the one coming from green energy will cause a oil crisis and its getting closer everyday
5955 2018-12-07 20:09:41 Problem remaining is the military actions of china.  china feels she needs control down through Australia in order to acquire+develop oil resources to stay on top...

5957 2018-12-07 20:09:38 Wolfcamp Shale and overlying Bone Spring Formation in the Delaware Basin portion of Texas and New Mexico’s Permian Basin province contain an estimated mean of 46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids
5958 2018-12-07 20:09:36 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
5959 2018-12-07 20:09:28 Top tip for cooking Kale.
Heat two table spoons of coconut oil in a pan, then add as much Kale as you like.
The coconut oil will help the kale slide off the pan into the bin beautifully.
5960 2018-12-07 20:09:21 Did you really just tweet that? Tillerson was CEO of a major oil company and you were CEO of a sham company.
You’re the one who’s dumb as a rock, stupid as a stone. I’ve got a potato on the kitchen counter that has a higher IQ than you! #RexWasRight #MoronInChief
5961 2018-12-07 20:09:20 Just a few decades ago, Venezuela had massive oil reserves and an abundance of other resources. It enjoyed wealth and an excellent standard of living. 
#Socialism
5962 2018-12-07 20:09:18 We live in odd times when I feel sympathy for an oil baron - yet here we are...
5963 2018-12-07 20:09:16 Just put some fancy oil shit on my face and if i dont wake up beautiful tomorrow im suing
5964 2018-12-07 20:09:09 #MAGA #MAGA2020 #DrainTheSwamp Petro-blackmail rears it's ugly head. When other countries call the bluff, what happens to the country whose main export is oil? Perhaps US could stop foreign aid to buffer the price increase?
5965 2018-12-07 20:09:09 Information in the 21st century is what oil was in the 20th century. #Huawei
5966 2018-12-07 20:09:02 Hahahah ofcourse , as a #CEO of one of the biggest Oil Compagnies in the world #Fool
5967 2018-12-07 20:09:00 Not so sure a CEO of an oil company that's in every country on earth would be considered "dumb as a rock." It's definitely possible to laude Pompeo without trashing Tillerson.
5968 2018-12-07 20:08:50 One doesn’t become CEO of one of the world’s largest oil companies by being lazy and stupid.
5969 2018-12-07 20:08:45 To add, let it be noted that Oil and Gas has cried wolf before and has gone on record as saying they “can’t afford” a loss in the Martinez case and that’s the reason they are fighting it. Hmmm...can’t afford our environment or health...funny that.
5970 2018-12-07 20:08:41 Its mind boggling how people believe either one of them. Obama sanctioned Rex/Exxon & Putin/Rosneft a few years ago after Putin and Rex made a deal to lease his land/pump the oil out of there. Trump brought rex in just for this. Rex is as dirty as anyone!! trump is covering him!
5971 2018-12-07 20:08:27 And when 25% of the tax base makes its income from oil and gas, you bet your sweet bippy it has a lot to do with equalisation. Why do you think average incomes are so much higher in Alberta than the rest of the country? The answer is mostly oil and gas.
5972 2018-12-07 20:08:05 I was like this kitten is gonna die bc I can’t afford a 2k surgery to free his farts smh but he’s fine now coconut oil heals everything
5973 2018-12-07 20:08:04 Oil change and gas $100 easily

5975 2018-12-07 20:07:45 Was that when we switched to the oil standard? What happens when we finally wean off oil? This might be a dumb question, but if I don't ask I'll never learn!
5976 2018-12-07 20:07:38 Are vitamin and snake oil sales down?
5977 2018-12-07 20:07:35 Please call Congress today, especially if you live in any of the Eastern Coastal regions to STOP DRILLING FOR OIL. 202-234-3121.
5978 2018-12-07 20:07:27 Largest  reserves of oil and natural gas EVER found in West Texas and eastern New Mexico. Gasoline in Texas currently at $1.92 a gallon.
5979 2018-12-07 20:07:22 the letter ẽ is pregnant with its second hands to a few of my next oil change is not due until AFTER the odometer rolls over to zero.
5980 2018-12-07 20:07:22 It's amazing to me how many people are totally fine with seeing others get screwed over so that they can make money. Oil workers are a prime example; they make big $'s working but it's a temporary job at best, yet they want BC to take the risk of losing our coastline. All for $!
5981 2018-12-07 20:07:17 Rosehip oil
5982 2018-12-07 20:07:17 Use To Hear That In British Area And Long time Till Late 60’S, It was Rare Sight Privilege To See Judges Political Agents,Now Should avoid coming on Print Media Saw Honourable Judges Oil Soaked Picture On Paper With Pakoras On it
5983 2018-12-07 20:07:17 He only ran a major US oil company much bigger than your dinky failed RE business.
5984 2018-12-07 20:07:15 Massive oil deal and he has a major Russian award  wonder why that is??
5985 2018-12-07 20:06:59 Y’all can’t tell me your car don’t ride like it’s brand new after a oil change lol

5988 2018-12-07 20:06:44 Most likely Putin. Remember when he nixed Romney for SOS? Guessing his connections to the oil industry is why.
5989 2018-12-07 20:06:37 I need some oil. I feel naked when I don’t have on perfume or someting.
5990 2018-12-07 20:06:36 Again Krissy is showing her bottomless ignorance. Jimmy championed renewable energy. He wanted us to get rid of our over dependence on foreign oil.
Obviously Jimmy is too intelligent for you to understand.
5991 2018-12-07 20:06:35 دراما
5992 2018-12-07 20:06:18 Yeah. He ran a multi billion dollar company and had intellect. Never fell for your bs. Do you know what it’s like for an oil company ceo to have more scruples than you. @Kokomothegreat @Kmarugan
5993 2018-12-07 20:06:14 Yea, I could have done without this tweet :)
5994 2018-12-07 20:06:11 Never... One word, “Oil”... Remember the fake information of weapons of mass destruction about Iraq, Tony Blair’s words... A summary of UK’s position; “beside US”. No matter what as long as it is profitable...
5995 2018-12-07 20:06:08 And we should go to a rock and take their oil.
5996 2018-12-07 20:05:54 If you look at our involvement in Tanker reflagging (op Earnest Will) you’ll notice (if you don’t already know off hand) that geopolitical moves were much more important that the price of oil in sparking intervention
5997 2018-12-07 20:05:53 Dress me up in me oil skins and jumper No more by the docks I'll be seen Just tell me old shipmates I'm taking a trip mates And I'll see you someday in Fiddlers Green. Chorus from folksong
5998 2018-12-07 20:05:50 Is there an essential oil that does a brain detox from ‘deep state’ conspiracy theories?
5999 2018-12-07 20:05:47 نعم صحيح شعب طيب  ونتم شعب  سهل استحماره
6000 2018-12-07 20:05:45 You've missed the point entirely. No one is "blaming" equalisation. They're merely pointing out the insult of happily and quietly accepting transfers derived largely from oil and gas income tax and royalties for decades only to kill the (cash) cow  once it stops producing milk.
6001 2018-12-07 20:05:40 Whyyyyy must oil changes cost so much, seriously over spending money
6002 2018-12-07 20:05:36 The problem is not the rest of Canada; the problem is BC. Our oil, that supports the whole country, is being held hostage by BC. It is time the federal government either dealt with BC, or learned to pay the bills without Alberta.  Another fucking generation of Trudeau!
6003 2018-12-07 20:05:32 Sardines in oil often works with kitties who won't eat because of the sniffles or other congestion--the stronger smelling the food the better
6004 2018-12-07 20:05:26 U said the same nice words for Rex. You even said he’s good at taking other country’s oil. When is @SecPompeo going to be fired ?
6005 2018-12-07 20:05:22 #US Economic Data: #BakerHughes Rotary #Oil #Rigs (Dec'1-7): Rigs 877 ↓-10 w/w, ↑+126 y/y. Variance: #Basin: Permian ↓-4, while Cana Woodford added↑+2 rigs w/w. #State: New Mexico ↑+2 rigs, while Oklahoma ↓-3 rigs w/w.
6006 2018-12-07 20:05:19 Anybody else has a “bad air filter” every time they get their oil change?
6007 2018-12-07 20:05:17 Went and got an oil change and I KID YOU NOT every single guy that works there has walked past my window and asked if I wanted a drink 
6008 2018-12-07 20:05:15 Oil prices surge after OPEC and partners reach deal to cut output to fix declining prices. WTI oil at $53.72/barrel, +$2.23.
6009 2018-12-07 20:05:11 If the ex-CEO of an oil company has to tell you that you can't do something because it's illegal...
You know that shit's really illegal
6010 2018-12-07 20:05:08 They should boycott the money upstream from oil revenue.
6011 2018-12-07 20:05:06 So if BC doesn't need Alberta oil, what are you going to use to run your cars?
6012 2018-12-07 20:04:59 My M5 mini gionee

I have repaired it 5times

6014 2018-12-07 20:04:55 bought unrefined olive oil and it's so fucking NASTY i can't use it as a dressing
6015 2018-12-07 20:04:50 "I only hire the best people"...Amazing how someone could become the CEO of the larges oil company in the world being so dumb and lazy.
6016 2018-12-07 20:04:50 $TSLAQ $TSLA Somebodies are really burning fund money oil to prop up Tesla. How much that adventure close to $380 cost today....
6017 2018-12-07 20:04:46 They won't do that as they will still require electricity, water and oil, electricity because they do not have the capacity, water because their water table is running low and with fracking will be spoiled
6018 2018-12-07 20:04:46 يستحق الاحترام والله ينصره
6019 2018-12-07 20:04:44 Hold on a sec, he is a rich man that ran the largest oil company in the US and he was “dumb as a rock” #bebest huh? @FLOTUS .
6020 2018-12-07 20:04:43 How he was dumb when the guy made millions from oil and you picked him to run your State Department? You mad because he wasn't your yes man!!!
6021 2018-12-07 20:04:29 how much? Not as much as the Billion that Trudeau wants to spend on pushing the pipeline through BC - or the $35+ Billion that the oil companies already OWE Alberta (which they will never pay). Oil is a parasite energy - it keeps sucking out our blood and gives us nothing back.
6022 2018-12-07 20:04:28 If any of my locals want to buy 750mg of CBD oil let me know. I was going to buy a 3 pack (more savings) So it would be $60. a bottle instead of $69. if you want to swing by and pick up a bottle. Let me know before I order today. :)
6023 2018-12-07 20:04:20 "I'm All About That Bass" doesn't get a lot of airplay these days. You're more likely to hear a song by Air Supply while getting an oil change at Sears Automotive
6024 2018-12-07 20:04:11 She has gone through a single mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation, keeps a tight diet regimen, increased her daily CBD dosage and now she is living life. To the fullest. Mutated Cells negligible. Cancer beaten. CBD Oil...a wonder drug people aren't aware of. Cheers Sire
6025 2018-12-07 20:04:10 Oil induced growth is not a thing to be excited about 
6026 2018-12-07 20:04:08 I have an oil well in my back garden, an olive oil well.  Does this count?
6027 2018-12-07 20:04:04 John Bolton is busy sucking up to the North Koreans this week.  Oh & Trump gave a written release to China & India to import Iranian oil despite sanctions. So, he & the rest of his sycophants could not care less
6028 2018-12-07 20:04:04 I can get this in TX? I need help with all three ailments and cannot touch opioids, as I cannot trust myself because of addiction. I've been following for a lil while, because I want, no need, to find an alternative for my sciatica pain. Wonder if your oil would help that? Ty!
6029 2018-12-07 20:03:54 Will never forget the day that random girl was under her car proving she can do her own oil change 
6030 2018-12-07 20:03:54 How come are eco-fascists using twitter, facebook with their PLASTIC-MADE devices to spew their propaganda toward honnest hard-working oil workers? It's like promoting veganism while eating a steak, it doesn't make sense whatsoever. Practise what you preach, then we'll talk.
6031 2018-12-07 20:03:52 If only someone could of warned us of the peak price of oil, and it's competitions advancements in electric motors, solar panels and battery tech. We may have been able to save billions...
6032 2018-12-07 20:03:42 Oh Gerald, you do know this will make Conservative heads explode, the troll farm will come out in force.. what about our oil, what about Canada, blah, blah, blah. As for myself, this makes me so proud to be a Canadian.
6033 2018-12-07 20:03:40 Bruscetta;
Tomato, basil, olive oil and garlic, grilled ciabatta
6034 2018-12-07 20:03:37 There is a way for both to coexist while we ween ourselves off of oil and gas. Unfortunately it's unaffordable for the common man. Additionally getting in the way of a pipeline and the Canadian economy works against the " clean" initiative.
6035 2018-12-07 20:03:24 I used honey as a mask and applied a mixture of Magnolia oil, Tissue oil and Tea tree oil on the damaged skin. I’d first apply olive oil before washing because soap can be drying. 
I was fortunate enough to be indoors till my skin healed so I didn’t worry about being too oily
6036 2018-12-07 20:03:21 So now we are rooting for former oil company execs who collaborated with the L. Ron Blubber?  This shit is getting dizzying.
6037 2018-12-07 20:03:15 @carcomplaints regarding Honda CRV oil dilution issue, dealer just told me it only applies to CRVs from certain plants and parts of the country and not all 2017-18 CRVs ex- I wonder?!
6038 2018-12-07 20:03:15 Michelle I think most reasonable people would be absolutely outraged by your views. You are clearly far more interested in saving the palm oil industry than you are interested in saving tropical rainforest & orangutan habitat.
6039 2018-12-07 20:03:11 it isn't even that radical of an idea, for god's sake, but try saying something like "I'm glad that shitty oil democrat lost tbqh" - old habits die hard, I guess
6040 2018-12-07 20:03:07 This is awesome it will create more jobs and help fuel our country now that we can actually use our own American oil instead of importing everything.
6041 2018-12-07 20:02:59 Not sure how not having our government give billions to the oil companies is going to cause people to freeze to death but I'd love to hear your reasoning.  You appear to be conflating LIHEAP funding with direct subsidies to the oil companies. I am imagine that was intentional.
6042 2018-12-07 20:02:57 This was code for "we need higher oil prices". My "people" are making enough money, with oil prices so low.
6043 2018-12-07 20:02:56 I’m still cackling at the fact that @Vfrican_beauty whipped out anointing oil during the final and passed me some 
6044 2018-12-07 20:02:55 Nothing for Alberta in confederation
BC Hypocrisy okayed a Huge Kitamat Tanker Terminal for China & opposes smaller Burnaby Terminal for Alberta. BC raping forests & mines coal for USA $
Que blocked Pipeline & use Foreign Tanker Oil while taking Ab Oil $ via Ottawa
Ab wants out
6045 2018-12-07 20:02:49 Ever try to recycle a barrel of oil?
6046 2018-12-07 20:02:45 Just some geese. We have plenty in this country. But just think how these oil $$ will translate into more Stormy Danielses, Louboutins for “Melanie”, nosejobs for Ivanka and safari trips for Eric. See the opportunities?
6047 2018-12-07 20:02:42 No more walking canes either! Sorry, Separation of Church and State dictates it.
6048 2018-12-07 20:02:28 imagine thinking 2 years ago that the big oil guy would be the legal and moral compass...
6049 2018-12-07 20:02:24 The fact that President Trump signed the Farm Bill and ethanol will bolster energy and generate more revenue for the fabric of America our farmers rather than foreign oil.
6050 2018-12-07 20:02:23 yeah might be an idea...we have had most of ur oil now so ur no good to us anymore...ps is kingsknoll hotel really a hotel or a parody
6051 2018-12-07 20:02:18 I mean like, so is some palm oil

6055 2018-12-07 20:02:03 If you are prone to dry skin during the winter, switch to a cleansing oil. Always check to make sure it doesn’t have ingredients like mineral oil in it or other skin irritants like fragrance. 
Good luck beauties!

6060 2018-12-07 20:01:43 I think I accidentally triggered mine with rosemary oil. For some reason, I can eat rosemary but in oil form, it ruins my life. 

And no problem at all! I am all about supporting my people where I can!
6061 2018-12-07 20:01:42 US is number 1producer of oil
6062 2018-12-07 20:01:36 Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.
6063 2018-12-07 20:01:30 Question to to experts & specialist in oil.
Is $ 59.5 per barrel “Comfortable price” if “ Yes” How come? 
Honestly I don’t know? I hope someone can help to understand? 
If “No” What about petrochemical transformation plan fund? Do you think there is alternative source of fund?
6064 2018-12-07 20:01:18 @this_vid
6065 2018-12-07 20:01:15 Dow down 627 with volume !!

name your top 2 geographic regions - based on lower dollar and oil ( brent) below $65
6066 2018-12-07 20:01:14 @Check_Oil hola buenas tardes no me puedo comunicar por su número de teléfono. A donde puedo comunicarme para hacer un consulta?
6067 2018-12-07 20:01:12 Stephen Barclay saying businesses want May’s deal rather the “uncertainty of no #brexit” (ie staying exactly as now that we can all see clearly). It is utterly breathtaking what these complete snake oil salespeople are prepared to say out loud. #c4news @mrjamesob #Newsnight
6068 2018-12-07 20:01:04 Thank for the tip! I'll check with them. That would be a very pleasant surprise. I think it only counts for CBD oil etc, but I don't think international shipping of buds is prohibited just yet (will be, very soon, hopefully, it has taken long enough).
6069 2018-12-07 20:00:57 If there is a vavoline close to you I recommend them. Not only do they change your oil they check your entire car to make sure the car is efficient for your safety
6070 2018-12-07 20:00:52 I suggest the brand “chi” my sister used to use that before straightening her hair and it’s really effective. Lots of brands that include Argon oil or coconut oil and stuff are also good ideas Bc it helps make ur hair healthier
6071 2018-12-07 20:00:52 I LOL’d
6072 2018-12-07 20:00:52 @z_one_concept hi I need to purchase Delicate permanent oil color 9.0 can you help?

6074 2018-12-07 20:00:49 Trudeau has apologized everyone except Albertans, for everything except for our shithole priced oil resource
6075 2018-12-07 20:00:48 Damn cold to be hiding out in my buried oil drum here in Northern Minnesota.
6076 2018-12-07 20:00:43 Went outside my comfort zone and went and got an oil change today.... Sad, I know. #lifewithanxiety
6077 2018-12-07 20:00:38 Seriously the noedy are brighter than anyone in Westminster, they saved thier oil... seriously why the fsck would they touch Westminster.
6078 2018-12-07 20:00:37 Christians really do wake up thinking that God gave them the intelligence to make plastics, drill oil, & that recycling or environmental health don’t matter because God has “dynamic power,” but, awaiting return like someone needs to light a black-flame candle first, makes sense.
6079 2018-12-07 20:00:35 Why is it when I want to change my oil, it rain.. 
6080 2018-12-07 20:00:28 It's a weird world indeed when the most moral and ethical man working for the administration moonlights as an oil tycoon... Shocking!
6081 2018-12-07 20:00:27 Omg I have a whole jar of coconut oil. I’m gonna try that!!!
6082 2018-12-07 20:00:26 we going  oil painting session! 
wish me luck!
6083 2018-12-07 20:00:26 I wash my face twice a day with cetaphil but I add a couple of drops of tea tree oil as an anti bacterial, then I take an Inner Defense Pill from Young Living. For moisturizer I use Signature Club A, toner is Mario Bedescu, and a vitamin C stick from Physicians Formula for scars
6084 2018-12-07 20:00:12 Iran gave OPEC the green light on Friday to cut oil output by around 0.8 million barrels per day from 2019, an OPEC source said. OPEC will later ask non-OPEC producers to contribute an additional 0.4 million bpd to the cuts
6085 2018-12-07 20:00:05 Gave Dave my tea tree oil to put on a spot a few days ago. Turns out since then, he's been using a different essential oil bottle...the Clary sage I use for period cramps 
6086 2018-12-07 20:00:01 The USS Arizona held approximately 1.5 million gallons (5.7 million liters) of “Bunker-C” oil. The ship burned for 2½ days. #PearlHarbor77
6087 2018-12-07 20:00:01 popcorn you sell contains palm oil as a main ingredient @IcelandFoods
6088 2018-12-07 19:59:56 We can pay for it with all the new found oil this country just found!  Woohoo can you say fuel independence!
6089 2018-12-07 19:59:45 How come eco-fascists are using plastic made I-phones and other cellphones to drive their message through twitter??? No oil means no plastic, practise what you preach bunch of eco-fascist hypocrites.
6090 2018-12-07 19:59:42 Apple pie with a big dollop of Russian oil on top.

6093 2018-12-07 19:59:37 Coconut oil is my go to!!! I don’t get anything from chapsticks and lip balms or Vaseline 
6094 2018-12-07 19:59:31 People who send messages to someone with terminal cancer suggesting they try Cannabis oil or any other pseudo science guff really are the absolute pits.
6095 2018-12-07 19:59:30 He's literally the biggest missing piece to their puzzle, a 6. + the Tuchel factor. This irrational PSG hate and farmers/oil money stuff is getting a bit tiring now.
6096 2018-12-07 19:59:29 Selling off our Public Lands for oil, gas, coal, copper, etc.!  All for greed & 
6097 2018-12-07 19:59:29 11:46am "Oil and Water" by Swearin'
6098 2018-12-07 19:59:26 Serious question: why would we import any oil at all if we have a surplus? I know oil is a "fungible" resource, so it doesn't really matter, but why pay to ship oil here in takers? Has to be expensive.
6099 2018-12-07 19:59:17 Of course he will.
Drive the price of oil down so low that we can not compete. And halt all wind and solar. The guy is here to destroy us.
6100 2018-12-07 19:59:16 i just found a spa here that does CBD oil massages omg...anyone wanna slide me $110...
6101 2018-12-07 19:59:06 Lol when did I say it was her fault? If anything I’m saying she uses inaccurate, sensational data used by people who profit from that sensationalized data. Kinda like how she listened to oil and gas companies instead of independent geologists when it came to earthquakes.
6102 2018-12-07 19:59:06 11:46am Oil and Water - Swearin' - Fall Into the Sun(Merge)
6103 2018-12-07 19:59:03 No. Snarky Snake oil $27 Salesman Sanders, had people hacking through the DEMS firewall & stealing data,  illegally use of logos & fraudulent endorsements, FEC campaign violations, threatened Superdelegates, & still hasn't shown his taxes!! #NeverBernie #BerntDaFckOut
6104 2018-12-07 19:58:59 It’s more eco-friendly to stop producing oil. That’s what we should be doing. Period. Plus, what are the chances that more money from oil will spur a drive to solar? Slim to none. Money begets money and if we don’t nip it in the bud nothing will change.
6105 2018-12-07 19:58:40 Those subsidies dwarf in front of the money we spent defending interests of nations like Saudi Arabia so that oil for our gasoline is burnt cheaply in our cars. Indeed automotive companies made a lot of money selling gas guzzlers due to cheap oil subsidized by our national debt.
6106 2018-12-07 19:58:30 Liberals aren't bright. Just evil.
6107 2018-12-07 19:58:29 Add these too:

No press meets
No development
No country tour left
No prices controlled(oil)
No black money brought back
No farmers happy
No corporates unhappy

6108 2018-12-07 19:58:27 je me suis démaquillée avec black cleaning oil d’erborian j’ai l’impression que mon âme entière a été nettoyée
6109 2018-12-07 19:58:24 Lol the same people you don't want to see you breaking bones are still the one's you'll meet up there in the room. So the aim of design has been defeated.
6110 2018-12-07 19:58:13 Those eco-fascists would rather have dangerous trains and rusty boast carrying oil instead of the safety of a pipeline. Actually, they don't want oil at all, practice what you preach bunch of eco-fascist morons, I don't want to see any plastic from you wish means no technology.
6111 2018-12-07 19:58:11 Someone tell them to flip it over.
6112 2018-12-07 19:58:11 Nothing beats getting an oil change for $7 lol
6113 2018-12-07 19:58:09 Lots of First Nations work in the oil patch which you are trying to destroy! Cancel the carbon tax! Call an election!

6115 2018-12-07 19:58:00 Nuuu, use coconut oil.
6116 2018-12-07 19:57:55 You'd rather import oil from Saudi Arabia.
6117 2018-12-07 19:57:49 CARotene oil
6118 2018-12-07 19:57:47 To the guy that hit my car I hope your engine oil runs out and you destroy your engine
6119 2018-12-07 19:57:42 That's a bad attempt at a joke, right? Gun grabbing is #Liberal's version if #thewall . It's just some bullshit people say to get elected and never plan to actually work on. How asking you not to burn #Saudi oil and radioactive coal grabs guns is beyond me, though.
6120 2018-12-07 19:57:29 CBD oil is a wonder drug. I had been extracting oil from Igbo for awhile now to help alleviate pains of a loved one. Later we found out the regular pea size dose of CBD oil taken daily was actually reducing the size as she dropped from a Stage III to a Stage II.
6121 2018-12-07 19:57:20 Thank you Schaeffer’s Oil!
6122 2018-12-07 19:57:09 Perhaps because carbon pricing is the right thing to do, both environmentally and economically. The largest players in the oil sands support carbon pricing, so why don’t you?
6123 2018-12-07 19:57:09 You can buy CBD weed and oil
6124 2018-12-07 19:57:00 I just want a hot oil massage so I can relax. My body stay hurting.
6125 2018-12-07 19:57:00 And tRUMP is giving away our land for oil drilling and coal. I’m afraid for Idaho, Montana, Wyoming.
6126 2018-12-07 19:56:57 I gotta get my oil changed this weekend too
6127 2018-12-07 19:56:50 discoバグったみたいやな。

6128 2018-12-07 19:56:40 We noticed how well that went with oil!
6129 2018-12-07 19:56:35 Lah ngapain dipkein baby oil?
6130 2018-12-07 19:56:30 *крепко крепко обнимает* 
6131 2018-12-07 19:56:27 @Independent #oilprices #ClimateChange OPEC oil production and prices article in the i today - as usual no mention of climate change and the COP meeting in Poland. Oil eonomy and environmental collapse - integrally linked. Oil articles should always be linked to climate costs.
6132 2018-12-07 19:56:17 See recent discoveries in Delaware basin, Wolfcamp Shale and Bone Spring formation
6133 2018-12-07 19:56:14 Oil
6134 2018-12-07 19:55:49 Life is more than oil.
6135 2018-12-07 19:55:38 It’s definitely the reflection, you can see the oil barley moves from its original place.
6136 2018-12-07 19:55:38 Lying in bed listening to Abra. I’m showered, moisturised, coconut oil on my face. Super glad that I didn’t end up going out after my work Christmas party last night. The universe is directing me as always 
6137 2018-12-07 19:55:37 Except it's it's more 65% olive oil and 35% butter
6138 2018-12-07 19:55:37 More like the oil firm Derby
6139 2018-12-07 19:55:27 And with all the layoffs, cheep oil, on and on. Who the hell is going to pay for his new ideas ? The working population is getting decreasing and where does he think his money comes from.
6140 2018-12-07 19:55:19 I just bought one today at target for $20 & I’m already in love! You do have to buy the essential oil separate but I think it’s worth it
6141 2018-12-07 19:55:13 The Bush family has been on Saudi and big oil payrolls since day one.
6142 2018-12-07 19:55:10 I hate when I go to car places and their like “you need this done and that done, I recommend you get it today” yea, well I recommend you do my oil change and leave me alone  are you paying? No. Ok.
6143 2018-12-07 19:55:09 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
6144 2018-12-07 19:55:09 Yes but can you imagine loosing the oil fields for a year like Kuwait? You will have gas rationing and $10 buck gas
6145 2018-12-07 19:55:08 See, I got started doing voices because I listened to ‘The Chronicles of Narnia’ audiobooks when I was little. My friend got started because he drank motor oil at age 2.

6147 2018-12-07 19:55:01 Get YOUR Omega 3 Fish Oil 135 for £6.99 1000mg and 270 capsules for £12.99 1000mg for Heart, Brain and Eye Health may reduce cholesterol @LeedsMarkets @MarketRedirected
6148 2018-12-07 19:54:55 Seriously, she reacts to some extent to bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, all fruit and vegetables, nuts, pulses, anything with sunflower oil in...... it's a nightmare.  She had only eaten sourdough toast yesterday morning....
6149 2018-12-07 19:54:52 Those aren't oil jobs, so they don't count.

Also: Trust fund! French! NEP! Piiiiiiiiiiiiiipppppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllliiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeesssssssssss!
6150 2018-12-07 19:54:52 Get some Melaleuca (tree tea oil) add 8 to 10 drops to your water bottle and spritz all around the base of the tree and lower branches. Cats don’t like the smell and dogs aren’t a big fan either. You may have to periodically reapply. Good luck.
6151 2018-12-07 19:54:43 I would say it depends on your hair & day. I def do a pineapple & just oil my scalp for a couple days too. I really only try to dampen my hair outside of the original day cuz I like it a lil fuzzy & messy. My hair just eats moisture so oil on deck!
6152 2018-12-07 19:54:35 War pays for oil.    Finally, the Mexican-America war of 1846-48 is paying off.
6153 2018-12-07 19:54:32 All the oil comes out of the pavement and makes it slippery not like other places
6154 2018-12-07 19:54:30 I tried to let the logs burn down a bit first then cooked the meat on the opposite side to avoid flames and flare ups. On the top level it's quite a way away from the heat too. No oil just salt and loads of oak smoke.
6155 2018-12-07 19:54:25 I was at a Chinese restaurant that had like truffle salmon fried rice or something like. Also truffle oil is some good ass shit
6156 2018-12-07 19:54:20 Not true.  Western Canada has very competitive crude supply both within the oil sands and from other unconventional sources.  Partial cycle oil sands is very low-cost as we grow within the facilities currently in place.
6157 2018-12-07 19:53:54 Talk about washing the dishes with oil
6158 2018-12-07 19:53:47 Oh, man, does he know Avenatti will not be of much help this time?
6159 2018-12-07 19:53:45 I want to lick the oil off you
6160 2018-12-07 19:53:28 I'm a fan of baking them with oil, salt and pepper, then adding a bit of balsamic vinegar.
6161 2018-12-07 19:53:25 She even said except they will allow her to bring her animals and continue her palm oil business. She died 8years after great grandpa.

6164 2018-12-07 19:53:04 The results of total dependence on foreign oil.  Never again
6165 2018-12-07 19:53:01 Are you aware of the whole oil picture?  Pls, catch up on the A-Z supply chain of big oil. Everything goes back to this: every war, every climate degrade, every single imbalanced economy topples in every capital due to the big oil as commodity. Really study this.
6166 2018-12-07 19:52:57 Does anyone know what % of Alberta oil workers are originally from east of Manitoba?  Seems to me there were lots coming out for the jobs, the past 50 years.
6167 2018-12-07 19:52:56 Maybe instead of fighting climate change (the symptomatic results of) you should focus on the causes...buying a pipeline to stimulate the worst GHG segment of the oil sector (the cause) is contributing to the problem 100% of the time.
6168 2018-12-07 19:52:56 #US Economic Data: #BakerHughes Rotary #Oil #Rigs (Dec'1-7): Rigs 877 ↓-10 w/w, ↑+126 y/y. Variance: #Basin: Permian ↓-4, while Cana Woodford added↑+2 rigs w/w. #State: New Mexico ↑+2 rigs, while Oklahoma ↓-3 rigs w/w.
6169 2018-12-07 19:52:56 Clove oil is amazing. 4 kids later, it was my go to
6170 2018-12-07 19:52:55 Try frying in olive oil with fresh sage leaves -a recipe stolen from @MrCaldesi keep it pink in the middle (calves liver) delicious!
6171 2018-12-07 19:52:51 Of course it fits conscious consumption. I just picked up a bottle of Nutiva's red palm oil. Way more expensive than other veg oils but good for my conscience
6172 2018-12-07 19:52:41 Time for all the Canadian and US libtards to be put in a single state to fend for themselves... no oil or farming
6173 2018-12-07 19:52:38 Good idea. The problem  is  both federal and provincial and the country  needs to start using our oil first. Pipeline east.
6174 2018-12-07 19:52:38 75$ a week
6175 2018-12-07 19:52:38 Oil was a prob, someone made it valuable, price skyrocketed. Ppl figured out how to produce/process/distribute efficiently causing price to fall by more than 90%. Price of steel similarly fell by 90+%. Prices are reflection of S&D - manipulating prices w $ policy only disrupts
6176 2018-12-07 19:52:29 나는 건성피부이고 단단한 제형의 버터크림같은 질감의 크림이 엄청 잘 맞는 편인데 대부분의 사람들은 그런거 안 좋아하나보다. 세포라에서 뭐좀사볼까 하고 모이스처라이저 인기제품 들여다보는중인데 대부분 light, oil free 같은 키워드가 인기임.. ㅜㅜ
6177 2018-12-07 19:52:25 Where did you get the impression this was 'happening overnight'. The only people I've ever seen say this are gas&oil proponents who act as though all the infrastructure that's currently in place wouldn't serve the transition.
The rest of the world is *moving* to green now though.
6178 2018-12-07 19:52:16 Always good to invest in a great bottle of extra virgin olive oil.
6179 2018-12-07 19:52:11 Oil toil yo uhm. THE HORRID screeching. Better must be too one on one. Could you toot a listen. Thanks fart.
6180 2018-12-07 19:52:09 On WCBS news radio 88 this morn their piece on this said the people were confused. Rising oil prices caused increased fuel costs, not taxes and rioters taking it out on Macron. Riiiight
6181 2018-12-07 19:52:07 Well it’s smart because there’s so much oil on the roads here. I happen to appreciate it when everyone slows down. At least they’re being safe
6182 2018-12-07 19:51:58 将来的にこういうデバイスが普及するのかな
6183 2018-12-07 19:51:51 can you empty poppers into an essential oil diffuser i’m asking for me
6184 2018-12-07 19:51:31 Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (#OPEC) and partner countries, including Russia agreed to cut oil output by combined 1.2 million barrels a day in hope of boosting prices.
6185 2018-12-07 19:51:30 A sad testimony to the governments in Canada & their disregard of oil/gas (high contributors to the GDP) I’m sorry to see very intelligent businessmen/women leave Canada’s oil & gas industry. Not only will this country feel the effects of reduced dollars but brain drain too! SMH
6186 2018-12-07 19:51:21 I asked my dad to put some windshield wiper fluid in my car and he was like :

wait for it

“yeah we might as well check the oil while we got the hood up” 

DID ALL DADS COME FROM THE SAME PLANET?!!!
6187 2018-12-07 19:51:15 My mom is ALWAYS playing games, son. Just buy tf pigtail to put in the oil down 
6188 2018-12-07 19:51:14 皮膚にチップ入れる未来よりも、リングの方が未来感あるしおしゃれ
6189 2018-12-07 19:51:06 No, we dont have much potential for hydro, it's the prairies.  But we do have plenty of tar sands.  So we have lots of investment there, just like every other place on earth with untapped oil.

The "Albererta Oil Crisis" is fabricated fear mongering

If it's fear you want look at the state of the global environment
.
6192 2018-12-07 19:51:00 @michellemungall When being asked a direct question on getting Canadian oil to market, answer the bloody question idiot. Are you sure you have the competence to speak about this?
6193 2018-12-07 19:50:56 Why is ABs crisis Canada's crisis, yet ABs oil fortunes are not also? I support all of Canada but recall the days of " let those eastern bast_rds freeze in the dark"...as a Nova Scotian that was pretty offensive...
6194 2018-12-07 19:50:53 Who is more likely to lie? Scientists and independent researchers, or the "news" corporations funded by oil companies?
6195 2018-12-07 19:50:50 How are they getting  oil? Good to hear, am curious?
6196 2018-12-07 19:50:42 drilling for oil???
6197 2018-12-07 19:50:40 Scotland already had the biggest deficit in Europe, it’s budget comes entirely from the UK, the price of oil is at an all time low, all while public spending is out of control
6198 2018-12-07 19:50:38 Holy shit that’s awesome!
I don’t think our city has enough baby oil for him!
6199 2018-12-07 19:50:38 ตื่นมาทำอะไรตอนนี้เนี่ยยยย
6200 2018-12-07 19:50:34 You skipped over the part of the U.S condemning the brutal invasion of China by the Japanese Empire. Our oil fueled their war machine and after events like the "Rape of Nanjing" the U.S cut off support.
6201 2018-12-07 19:50:27 #WhatCanadaLoses is the future of our children and grandchildren after corrupt politicians have sold off their environment to the oil industry.

6203 2018-12-07 19:50:10 Maybe we should all save resources so we can divert some of our time and use our surplus to seek out new sources of oil or alternative energy?

@OilPro2
6205 2018-12-07 19:50:01 Only as of 16th November? So after what about 15 years of existence & millions of hectares cleared for palm oil the RSPO FINALLY decides to ban deforestation. Another shallow exercise in image damage control #toolittletoolate Absolutely Not convinced. Why would anyone be?
6206 2018-12-07 19:50:01 It’s all stolen oil, from stolen land, taken without consent, through genocide, and is as “dirty" as it gets. We have no moral leg to stand on.
6207 2018-12-07 19:49:57 So you are saying Beto was not the recipient of large amounts of bundled cash from Oil execs?
6208 2018-12-07 19:49:56 Ross please dont fall for fake news the everyday man is taking a beaten, of all races too, you know how many times ive seen ppl penny pinch for 4 items in the grocery line? Look at the socials, low demand in oil and gas we are in a recession, but that just means opportunity
6209 2018-12-07 19:49:56 Only thing for them is that the're not that relevant with oil a large national income with a tiny population. UK will be affected for rest of my lifetime if we stay now as #EU hosatges
6210 2018-12-07 19:49:42 We are so sorry! Colors with high pigmentation may have a tendency to stain. We recommend lightly buffing nails. Also, next time upon removal, apply a cuticle oil to avoid the skin from staining. Lastly, make sure to keep nails well hydrated which will also prevent staining.
6211 2018-12-07 19:49:30 But keep sending your oil money.
6212 2018-12-07 19:49:27 Good i didn’t want to see him at that snake oil club. He needs to be at United juve or Barca. But our club is a joke and he probably isn’t even on anyone’s list.
6213 2018-12-07 19:49:27 So far I’m loyal to Cantu shea butter products and Eden bodyworks. I just ordered more Jamaican black castor oil too.

6215 2018-12-07 19:49:24 Adding points (or reducing the points as you suggest) doesn't change the fact that oil is really god damn labor and time intensive to pull out of the ground. Again, you misunderstand the basics of resource scarcity.
6216 2018-12-07 19:49:17 Evil oil baron Rex Tillerson suddenly media's favorite former Sec. of State.
6217 2018-12-07 19:49:13 Saudi Arabia has cut oil production to boost oil prices. So much for Trump giving them a “murder pass” in return for cheap gas. The Saudis only do what benefits them. And Trump’s a sap once again.

6224 2018-12-07 19:48:49 As I’m getting my oil changed the guy said “I thought you was cheating on me with another business” I laughed and said never.. he looks around and said “honey I haven’t seen you since this spring..” I laughed and said I know... this man face of shock of me not changing my oil 
6225 2018-12-07 19:48:26 These people should stick to war medicine, away from nutrition. Focusing on diet alone is their way of drug dealing. Also cooking any oil is bad but if we must then avocado oil holds up best to high heat. But they all lose healthful structure under high heat not just coconut oil.
6226 2018-12-07 19:48:24 We already have the ability to ship to China. They don’t want/need our oil that’s why we sell to US. We do have a problem with the pollution associated with shipping in BC. There’s only so much I can say in 1 tweet. If you want to know more of what we care about FOLLOW US 
6227 2018-12-07 19:48:12 Hmm, does anyone know which bit of London you can find Chelmsford in?

Is it the bit in Knightsbridge where all the other self made zillionaires and oil sheiks are? I dunno, I've searched all over and I can't find it any where.
6228 2018-12-07 19:48:11 it's olive oil, salt and pepper, garlic powder, italian seasoning blend and a buuuunch of nutritional yeast (the yellow stuff). 

SO GOOD!!
6229 2018-12-07 19:47:56 No, its greedy bastards fault - everywhere. Stop dependence on oil, drugs. The end!
6230 2018-12-07 19:47:49 Only 50 (less?) years before we have sucked up the last of the fossil fuels. The World is ill-prepared to function and move World commerce, and people, without oil.
6231 2018-12-07 19:47:46 Shea moisture Black castor oil.
6232 2018-12-07 19:47:40 Yeah you have their back except if your in the Alberta oil patch.
6233 2018-12-07 19:47:32 How so with so many companies closing ?General Motors oil sand etc. Hell  it must be true tho as it’s on the CBC. Thanks Gerry we all appreciate your hard work.
6234 2018-12-07 19:47:30 Of course that would be good. Maybe you can start this great trend you're promoting by drilling for oil for a massively deflated price?  Maybe use some of your newly deflated Bitcoin to finance the operation?  :-)
6235 2018-12-07 19:47:21 Feds did not discover this resource. American oil companies have been drilling there for 50 years. American technology from horizontal drilling and big hydraulic fracturing techniques made it prolific and economic.

6246 2018-12-07 19:46:35 Rexy was chosen so that sanctions would be dropped for Russia and more ecosystems could be destroyed via oil exploration in the Arctic. Fossil fuel & arms dealers are the scourge of the world.
6247 2018-12-07 19:46:25 Would love to try this the oil we have here doesn't even take the edge off cauda equina
6248 2018-12-07 19:46:17 20 years ago I thought that what would save us from climate change would be running out of oil like we were always told would happen. Maybe Thomas Gold was right about oil being abiogenic. In which we are doomed. It seems we will only stop using fossil fuels when they are gone.
6249 2018-12-07 19:46:17 yes, pipelines exist everywhere....safety us exponentially better than trains and the tankers already in the ST L.  Re Plaster Rock NB spill was a train derailment, not a pipeline.  Look it up. And not that it matters, but only some of the oil was from AB, also from Sask and Man.
6250 2018-12-07 19:46:10 Open US oil reserves,
Create or aquire a Gov refinery,
Flood US w/cheap gas,
Use profits to replenish the Social Security fund that they pilfered.
6251 2018-12-07 19:46:07 They mention one of the "hazards" is oleic acid, which is the major component of olive oil. Real hazard is the high omega-3s in an oil that is not fresh and refrigerated. Omega-3s are perishable and go rancid quickly. Why linseed oil is good for varnish!
6252 2018-12-07 19:45:55 Hey Original Oil Paintings thanks for the follow!
6253 2018-12-07 19:45:45 Oil futures end higher, up more than 3% for the week
6254 2018-12-07 19:45:41 Imagine if them actually go discover oil inna Jamaica
6255 2018-12-07 19:45:30 I don't think Trudeau is destroying the economy, but maybe this isn't a good time for gloating. Young workers are increasingly employed in precarious labour, wages are stagnant in many parts of the country, and there are risks in both AB oil and ON manufacturing jobs
6256 2018-12-07 19:45:30 i knew that hair smelled  someone come give this girl some fkn coconut oil omg
6257 2018-12-07 19:45:27 This is what I want. This is how it should be. This is what I want to achieve. This is what I want to see if can get it done. Use what resources you need to get it done. Get back to me if you can or cannot do it and why. Oh yeah sounds like the oil company you use to work for.

6259 2018-12-07 19:45:17 got my oil changed, tire stem replaced, then got to fill up at $1.86/gallon. pretty productive day so far 
6260 2018-12-07 19:45:02 Municipalities facing this also need to look in the mirror at their own use of hydrocarbons and taking tax revenue from oil companies.
6261 2018-12-07 19:44:52 Easy, just fry up some salt and pepper! throw some hot sauce on that bad boy and cry because that's just hot salty oil 
6262 2018-12-07 19:44:51 Where’s the irony in that? I know that Tesla is an electric car, but oil is still running the world and still is the number one fuel in every single country.
6263 2018-12-07 19:44:49 “"I hope Premier Legault will speak about Quebec's experience, and how you can have the fastest growing economy in the country all while reducing emissions," McKenna told Radio-Canada recently.”

$11 Billion in transfer payments from oil producing provinces helps.
6264 2018-12-07 19:44:44 Move on .... from where we are to where we were 40 years ago ... but without a Navy, coal mines and North Sea oil ....
6265 2018-12-07 19:44:37 Saudi Arabia has us 'over a barrel' on the price of oil if we call their bearded sheikh a killer. Blackmail in all but name. Stopping arms sales to them will only hurt jobs here. There would be more justice in simply invading SA & taking the oil, than there was in invading Iraq.
6266 2018-12-07 19:44:34 At our current global oil consumption rate of 100 Million barrels per day, that's a whopping 460 days worth.  Big whoop!  Invest those resources into renewable energy solar and storage instead. #COP24 #ClimateChange

They will get it one way or another.
6275 2018-12-07 19:43:19 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.

6278 2018-12-07 19:43:00 Ah the irony of accusing ME of "speaking out of my ass" when I'm the one supporting my arguments with sources. I linked to an article documenting how oil companies influenced foreign policy in the region. You've offered nothing but unsubstantiated denials and childish insults.

6280 2018-12-07 19:42:39 (2 of 2) companies in the U.S. have already invested billions of dollars on claims up and down the Texas-New Mexico state line, tapping one of the nation's richest and most prolific oil and natural gas regions.
6281 2018-12-07 19:42:37 Not only will lavender oil not help me sleep, if someone sprays it I am likely to leave.
6282 2018-12-07 19:42:28 “Bad choices” is a massive understatement to what he has done. Being the mastermind behind the murder of other people over the interests of his damn oil company lands him a nice warm seat in hell.
6283 2018-12-07 19:42:27 Whenever I visit my rural home, I always come back loaded with produce, grain, and even cooking oil they express from peanuts. So, I never look down upon them or despise them.
6284 2018-12-07 19:42:22 Totally agree. It’s better to prosper and use the wealth in innovation ways for the world to change. I look to ALBERTA oil and gas industry as the most innovative as towards climate change over the past 20 years. BC and Canada are regressing under socialist system.
6285 2018-12-07 19:42:21 Good for you Peter. You are blocked.
Get stuffed..cheerio
6286 2018-12-07 19:42:21 Collective psychology is the main driver for oil prices, we are likely to see a rebound to the 30% drop, however; the down trend will be resumed regardless of what OPEC dose.
6287 2018-12-07 19:42:16 Yep America also found the biggest natural oil reserve ever recorded America winning again..

6291 2018-12-07 19:41:34 Wonder why he's OK with all the oil tankers in the St. Lawrence bringing in Saudi, Nigerian and Algerian crude.
6292 2018-12-07 19:41:27 It wouldn't be if the refinery was in Quebec instead of Atlantic provinces. Best way for @fordnation to undermine Trudea's Liberals is to have Energy East oil refined in Sarnia including LNG tanker traffic down St.Lawrence. Liberal voting Quebec and Atlantic  can get stuffed.

6296 2018-12-07 19:41:11 Oil wasnt created by man. Man found a use for it an now it a valuable commodity. Ripple created xrp sold it by the millions with no purpose, controlled 100% of it distribution and  just now figured out a way to say it might have a purpose besides making them rich. Blind sheep

6301 2018-12-07 19:40:40 My cousin had these seizures and marijuana/CBD oil has been a lifesaver. I don’t think you’ve been able to get a prescription for booze since that was a dodge during prohibition.
6302 2018-12-07 19:40:39 Collapse in crude oil prices combined with the massive world debt bubble may be the most frightening economic scenario I've ever witnessed. There is zero wiggle room and the Fed is in a panic.
6303 2018-12-07 19:40:38 You want to know how to be loved by the Media? Hate Trump!
Now a big oil exec is their hero!
6304 2018-12-07 19:40:34 You do realize that you are the only one here who thinks adding a bunch of points in a bank ledger makes more oil available for consumption do you not? 
6305 2018-12-07 19:40:34 Also, that oil stuff from this morning is looking correct.
6306 2018-12-07 19:40:29 They need to hurry up with this oil change, I got shit to do.

6308 2018-12-07 19:40:21 I think the opposition is to carbon reduction itself.  I support the revenue-neutral idea, but you have to deal with the oil lobby, the coal lobby, and the fears of workers.
6309 2018-12-07 19:40:13 In 1991, George W. Bush entered into an oil consortium made up of his crony investors.
The Bush family had oil wells in Kuwait, according to reports.
Until now, no one spoke of the public relations disaster of placing 120K U.S. troops on Saudi soil. See two WTC attacks, '93, '01

6315 2018-12-07 19:39:29 Here’s Why You Shouldn’t Warm Up Your Car In The Winter ??! Total bull shit at the highest level. If a car is setting and idling the pistons with the oil ring is still bring oil to the cylinder walls. Some people over think their brain compacity!
6316 2018-12-07 19:39:26 I put coconut oil on my skin after showering.

6317 2018-12-07 19:39:16 Heh touché. When oil the oil runs out ‘we’ (England) will cut ‘our’ (Scotland’s) extra spending by abolishing Barnet. Unless you think ‘we’ will be happy to subsidise ‘us’ until the end of time. 
6318 2018-12-07 19:39:08 Definitely organic coconut oil tho i use it for everything!!

6321 2018-12-07 19:38:48 Yep just a little bit of coconut or avocado oil should do the trick
6322 2018-12-07 19:38:47 We're a net exporter of oil and gas now, so there's that.
6323 2018-12-07 19:38:44 Why lay pipe when the price of oil is dropping by the day? The oil/tar sands are unprofitable below a very high price point.
6324 2018-12-07 19:38:40 I legit smell like a walking pumpkin pie.... This beard oil smells amazing... Tis the season. #bedlambeardcompany — feeling silly
6325 2018-12-07 19:38:33 Cushing is irrelevant for a while now as oil flow to Houston. The oil inventory in US has topped and just started the decline. The next few weeks should be mostly draw Unless China says they postpone importing crude from US.
6326 2018-12-07 19:38:21 Me too. I'm careless sometimes. But one thing I know is that all that metal and oil is cooold in the morning! Needs some warming up. I'll sit there for like 10 minutes and see all these ladies getting in and taking off.
6327 2018-12-07 19:38:18 @DrOz Disappointed the show is promoting products containing palm oil. All in the name of vanity. #SaveTheOrangutans #banpalmoil
6328 2018-12-07 19:38:17 I'd take the word of a snake oil salesman over a scientologist any day of the week.
6329 2018-12-07 19:38:05 All your oil in the Q to the left.
6330 2018-12-07 19:38:03 Just the upstream oil emissions, meaning the production of oil, not the consumption (like burning in car engine, use as plastic or asphalt, etc).
6331 2018-12-07 19:37:58 Unfortunately the lower price of Alberta oil is due to poor quality and very expensive to process. Not a national crisis
6332 2018-12-07 19:37:54 Saudi Arabia must be getting worried about their oil!
6333 2018-12-07 19:37:27 You're right. If oil fell from the sky like manna from heaven then we would all be better off as oil prices deflated to $0. 

What is it like living in an alternative reality?
6334 2018-12-07 19:37:27 STOP PUTTING COCONUT OIL ON UR FACE
6335 2018-12-07 19:37:25 Not this time I think. In late Cycle oil show deflationary slow down.
6336 2018-12-07 19:37:18 Meanwhile countries with horrible human rights records and terrible environmental standards supply the world oil that we produce with WAY more environmental controls and in a free society.  So who loses? We do and so does the world.
6337 2018-12-07 19:37:15 Cool brother, done that for five years in oil industry
6338 2018-12-07 19:37:09 There was the fire at Forte Oil and a tanker fell on its side on the expressway today.
6339 2018-12-07 19:37:07 Bills, oil changes, baby necessities adulting is something serious 
6340 2018-12-07 19:37:03 I get it. We don't want people to suffer. At the same time, I don't think we can continue using oil the same way... What to do???
6341 2018-12-07 19:36:46 So Saudi oil is A OK, but Alberta oil is Taboo. Got it.
6342 2018-12-07 19:36:41 Hey on the JFK Junior info did you know Onassis last deal was after he married Jackie. He signed a deal 400 million for gas and oil for Greece with ColonelPapadopoulos

The Greek military backstabbed him and he lost half the deal.

As a child he escaped as  Christians persecuted
6343 2018-12-07 19:36:40 There are other uses for oil besides burning it.
6344 2018-12-07 19:36:37 The people went about and gathered it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, cooked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and its TASTE was LIKE the taste of PASTRY prepared with OIL.
Numbers 11:8 NKJV
6345 2018-12-07 19:36:37 Time to get this oil change #ihateadulting
6346 2018-12-07 19:36:36 Oil still seeps from the Arizona. There’s always a small oil slick over the top....
6347 2018-12-07 19:36:36 me too! (liking writing community here). On audio, I'd like to have the rest of Oil Apoc out on audio, but I'd have to have Tantor offer for me to get that! (I'll never self-produce on my own, I'm afraid.) Not impossible, but not yet.
6348 2018-12-07 19:36:33 Guess @realDonaldTrump hired Wall Street to keep Oil Price low #opec #oott
6349 2018-12-07 19:36:31 If I offered you $25.00 off CBD Oil, would you give it a try? 
Yes or No?
I have some to giveaway ...
6350 2018-12-07 19:36:21 Oh hell! Dark soy sauce, oyster saucer, ginger, garlic, star anise, toasted sesame oil, syrup etc. Grab and throw....
6351 2018-12-07 19:36:18 Well as I recall in those days oil was $$$$ to begin with, in terms of, say, Brent Crude. So everything else went up. I don't think the recession drove gas prices. That said, if I'm selling X and I need to sell so much X to make ends meet + fewer ppl are buying, I up price of X.
6352 2018-12-07 19:36:14 OK, cool, but somebody TTC- seabed oil pipelines 2 replace old leaky?
With an access panel 4 maintainance & stuff?
Like the subway tunnels?
6353 2018-12-07 19:36:12 $USO Oil reversing after an OPEC Cut in Production! Hello Recession! It Couldn't be more obvious now imo! $QQQ $SPY $IWM!
6354 2018-12-07 19:36:06 Whether it’s Trudope or not, AB is fed up with the delusional anti-oil rhetoric plaguing Canada, and destroying AB’s way of life without remorse! We are sick of it. Nothing moves without oil, bleeding hearts GET OVER IT. Or we will take our oil & run.
6355 2018-12-07 19:36:05 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
6356 2018-12-07 19:36:02 My hair growth is crazy. Ion do nun to it but wash it, condition it, moisturize it, put oil in it and let it sit under some weave.
6357 2018-12-07 19:35:56 She’s got oil in her hair #TOTP
6358 2018-12-07 19:35:45 You want us to follow them or not to follow them? I'm confused.
6359 2018-12-07 19:35:43 I don’t think the drop in Oil from the highs is warranted
6360 2018-12-07 19:35:36 Bill C69 is unworkable, read up on it. FYI,  There are many products that go into TM today, such as gasoline and Dilbit.  The only semi logic complaint from BC is marine protection (Dilbit sinks faster than oil) and the Libs (rightly) spent more $$ on spill protection.
6361 2018-12-07 19:35:30 And the decision was swift. Kudos
6362 2018-12-07 19:35:30 You guys reinvesting oil money into renewable energy?
6363 2018-12-07 19:35:29 How could we find new oil, the dinosaurs are dead long ago. Wait maybe oil wasn't made from fossils after all, hmmmm????
6364 2018-12-07 19:35:26 Nibba is drinking motor oil aka bud light
6365 2018-12-07 19:35:19 Since I moved from West Houston less than two years ago, yes. It's also soft, but the oil bust already took out some of the hot air. Still frothy but not as exuberant as DFW
6366 2018-12-07 19:35:17 HOLY FATHER, MAY THE FIRE OF YOUR WORD BE FED BY THE OIL OF YOUR HOLY SPIRIT ONTO THEIR SAVLVATION AND MAY YOU SEND OUT HAVESTERS ON TO YOUR RIGHTEOUS HARVEST IN THE NAME JESUS OUR LORD AND SALVATION AMEN!!! HALLELUJAH
6367 2018-12-07 19:35:09 Varian kleveru oil yg bagus yg apa aja sih selain sunflower seed? /rlt/
6368 2018-12-07 19:35:05 Ok ok...he’s a snake oil salesman
6369 2018-12-07 19:34:55 Bet the spot in your city that's the most fire you can get pink oil and backwoods in the same strip mall
6370 2018-12-07 19:34:50 Ironically funny, big oil guy, highly educated and wanted u to break the law. So is that why Mike Pompeo looks and acts like he's hiding shit! After what he and Bolton with the killing of USA resident, obviously not their shining moment laughing at the United States.
6371 2018-12-07 19:34:33 For 1st time in 75 years, the US has become a net oil exporter. The U.S. is the world’s largest petroleum producer, having surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
If the Saudis cut production, US oilers will win with increased prices of oil. No wonder Trump doesn’t care about murder
6372 2018-12-07 19:34:32 So if I take something from the liberal Playbook what I think needs to happen is a shortage oil Imports to Quebec. Alberta might be rethinking instead of buying real cars they may want to buy a Navy
6373 2018-12-07 19:34:29 I read about this months ago , what you fail to mention is if this oil is pumped out of the ground it will cause catastrophic problems with fault lines and cause sink holes .
6374 2018-12-07 19:34:26 So who hasn't tried cbd oil yet? Who wants to?
6375 2018-12-07 19:34:21 Will they also include how his presidency hurt LGTB people, his legacy of trickle down economics, illegal wars for profit and oil, His awful attorney general, plus his sons stealing elections and creating even worse scenarios? I’m kind of over all the praise for this Man.
6376 2018-12-07 19:34:13 Nice facial oil's,  count me in please!
6377 2018-12-07 19:34:01 أهم شي أنه صحيح..
6378 2018-12-07 19:34:00 Charlie CBD oil and hempseed capsules has kept me off 13 prescriptions since 2016. Cannabis has calmed my anxiety and keeps me out of jail!!
6379 2018-12-07 19:33:52 Yup. Also fighting her own NDP counterpart next door. She's basically fooked. That's what oil does. Taints everything.
6380 2018-12-07 19:33:50 And you've got no fact-based logic of your own, just "belief". Good luck with that snake oil.
6381 2018-12-07 19:33:48 At oil change. I had a recall. Transmission programming. They are doing it now. Another 45mins to an hour.
6382 2018-12-07 19:33:47 Wizard Oil is good stuff!
Dumbledore used it....
6383 2018-12-07 19:33:46 awal sem aku dah burning the midnight oil korang tak dedor ke?
6384 2018-12-07 19:33:46 How much would burning this oil contribute to our climate problems?
6385 2018-12-07 19:33:40 TBH, I'm having second thoughts on this after seeing Saudi oil minister clip, in which he partly credited Modi's lobbying for fall in crude prices. If scholarships payouts  can get him that sort of lobbying power, which benefits country many times more, may not be a very bad idea
6386 2018-12-07 19:33:37 until opec increased their output and because of the higher cost of extracting that oil we stopped production
6387 2018-12-07 19:33:33 I don’t know what tremble means, so I don’t do that. I do clean the gasket and I’ve replaced it a few times. I oil it after cleaning, but it doesn’t always lay flat against the lid, almost like it’s a little too big. I end up having to open the pot to re-oil it and press it down.
6388 2018-12-07 19:33:33 After every beard wash. If you have a beard conditioner use that before you apply the oil.
6389 2018-12-07 19:33:31 $EOG most over rated oil stk out there
6390 2018-12-07 19:33:29 Yup. 30 yrs ago or so they were warned the Chinese would dangle the carrot of their now 1.4B consumer market but would never let us in. Out west they used to call those folks snake oil salesmen, the other side was the sucker. Here we are
6391 2018-12-07 19:33:25 Telling the jurors the case was neither close nor complicated, Richenthal left the panel with a picture of Ho looking at a map of Ugandan oil fields.

“That is what bribery looks like: an international businessman looking at oil fields that he bought his way into,” he said.
6392 2018-12-07 19:33:08 Umm no I don’t think so. He stating that we should make them pay a fine for buying oil from countries such as Saudi Arabia et al. Nothing more. I for one love all of Canada.
6393 2018-12-07 19:33:02 @GrouponHelpUS I bought a Groupon for an oil change at Scotts Custom Classics in Ajax Ontario and have not been able to contact them for an appointment. They do reply to my Email and no ones answers the phone. I cannot contact Groupon either.
6394 2018-12-07 19:32:59 Falling strongly the field activity for the shale oil as the barrel collapses, showing how fragile this operation really is. In the hands of #OPEC should be the confinement of the shale producers; it is only a matter of will, which evidently isn’t there.
6395 2018-12-07 19:32:54 thank god today is the last oil change in my car maintenance plan. the appointment was at 9 they just called me that they are finished. the homie takes 30 mins in greenfield tf they doing over here
6396 2018-12-07 19:32:45 OPEC just slashed production, so oil prices will be just fine and back to ripping off #Canadian @RachelNotley #Alberta

6403 2018-12-07 19:32:00 Not going to lie, I’m loving Rachel Notley’s fiesty defence of Canadian oil. She even called out Eastern Canada for importing foreign oil. 

Bravo, @RachelNotley!  #ableg #FirstMinisters

6406 2018-12-07 19:31:35 Um... you do realize canada isn't the only country selling oil right?
6407 2018-12-07 19:31:32 The reason Jeff doesn't remember Alberta refusing to pay their fair share is because it never happened. What planet are you from? Alberta has been floating the Canadian economy since I have been alive, and I am 60. And reasonable oil prices are not $12US per barrel of WCS. Sorry.
6408 2018-12-07 19:31:25 I was born in 1944. My first trip to Hawaii was in January of 1962. We tied up in the spot astern of the Arizona. The memorial did not exist then and oil seeped from the hull. It was a powerful moment for me.
6409 2018-12-07 19:31:16 I cook eggs in butter with a little olive oil.
6410 2018-12-07 19:31:02 Just a good ol’ Alberta, emphasis on ol’! (Oil)
6411 2018-12-07 19:31:02 There are not" both side's" of the science, one side is science  the other side is not science, just rich people wanting to keep selling coal or oil.

6416 2018-12-07 19:30:35 If you ever have an opportunity to visit the USS Arizona Memorial, do so.  It's one of them moving things you will ever do.  The oil can be seen and there is some beautiful art that captures it.
6417 2018-12-07 19:30:34 Trump embarrassed the USA with his support of MBS in the murder of #Khashoggi to keep oil prices low. Trump the great deal maker falls flat again.

6421 2018-12-07 19:30:15 Not mentioned here is that Albertans elected Notley whose views on oil and pipelines are the same as Trudeau's.
6422 2018-12-07 19:30:03 As a consequence Europe will be needing to buy more weapons from the US and have more Army bases to stop the Beautiful Big Bad Bear-the puppet EU have been spewing and ramping up the US "Russia's a Threat" line-as a consequence they will be relying on Israeli oil and US arms

6428 2018-12-07 19:29:47 No it’s just another layer that people like tanden like to separate trump from the political framework that upholds him. Separates his specific individual motives from the structural motives (weapons/oil).

6436 2018-12-07 19:29:13 Not by choice. You talk like a pipeline to East Coast is easy peasy. Have you flown over Quebec and New Brunswick. Lakes and rivers. Thousands. We'd love to have more AB oil.  There was a spill in Plaster Rock with AB oil. My friends home,land,water destroyed. Received peanuts.
6437 2018-12-07 19:29:02 Next it will be disability
6438 2018-12-07 19:29:00 So you're saying she's responsible for the low price of oil when the price of oil started dropping before she was elected?

6441 2018-12-07 19:28:51 If we are such a drain on England's resources. Then ask yourself why Westminster want to hold on to us. Maybe because over 90% of the oil is in Scottish Waters. Scotland pays more into the Treasury than it gets back. 
6442 2018-12-07 19:28:50 How long till oil crashes?
6443 2018-12-07 19:28:39 I'm old enough to remember Bill Clinton pardoning Marc Rich for making oil deals with Iran during the hostage crisis. And HW pardoning everyone in the Iran Contra affair.

6449 2018-12-07 19:28:05 Lol my Libra BROKE his finger at his oil job about a week ago, and it has caused so many problems. I don’t believe he’s been able to bartend as much. He’s so scared of losing his job he won’t even tell them it’s broken. His finger got STUCK in a machine and it “hurt like hell”
6450 2018-12-07 19:28:02 Pearl Harbor fact: Did you know that the USS Arizona still leaks fuel? The day before the attacks, the Arizona was filled with 1.5 million gallons of oil. To this day 9 quarts of oil still seep out of it's wreckage daily. Locals call it "the ship that's still bleeding"
6451 2018-12-07 19:28:01 Unloaded my junk bond fund today... Should have done it a month ago. I think a lot of junior oil producers will go belly up in 2019 depressing the junk market further. I could be wrong, and my sale is probably signalling a bottom though.
6452 2018-12-07 19:27:49 Hey Simply:  Saudi Arabia necessary to countering Iran.  Time to grow up and see the big picture.  Also would you like your gas prices to double.  SA controls a big oil supply.  Even though Trump has made US energy independent, if Saudi’s Cut supply, prices will go up.  MJ

6458 2018-12-07 19:26:56 @MercedesGlobal in your report on who feds object to speaking also receive dark money support from oil and energy industry, they are not there for facts, but to lobby for for interests outside Canada, like the CTF and kenney isnt a prov leader but UCP receiving shady $ too

6460 2018-12-07 19:26:39 peanut oil - deep frying, asian food, homemade peanut butter, searing most meat
olive oil - salads, pasta dishes (hot or cold), most vegetables, garlic chips, fish (add some butter tho)
corn oil - tofu, deep fried sweets, almost all mexican food

no other oils needed.
6461 2018-12-07 19:26:37 Oil game? What did he do wrong ?
6462 2018-12-07 19:26:32 Does the 3% represent just reduced industrial activity or the barrels of oil not being burnt or both?
6463 2018-12-07 19:26:24 Second, if the difficulty-to-price ratio drops down to "profitable" again, why not just fire up the old mining rig again? It's like the oil industry. As the price drops, those that can't break even get out, but when the price is right, people get back in.
6464 2018-12-07 19:26:07 Like y’all I stay making sure I get a oil change and filter:. But my  brakes he said ma’am you like just in time cause your brakes were about to go out 
6465 2018-12-07 19:26:07 24000 in the last month  and price of Alberta oil is up 71% since Sunday. Alberta got to be smiling.

6470 2018-12-07 19:25:57 It’s not fussy! The gasoline we exported could have come from oil imported from Canada, etc. It’s like saying the U.S. is the biggest raiser of chickens because we export so many McNuggets. It’s not the same thing!
6471 2018-12-07 19:25:50 oh no i love olive oil :/ it’s def a strong flavor tho
6472 2018-12-07 19:25:48 I think they honestly don't realize? Most popular brands sold in department stores are basically inedible alcohol so they don't know the difference. I would love to introduce them to essential oil perfumes instead. But then I would have to talk to them about how they smell...
6473 2018-12-07 19:25:36 Time to cut off all Foreign Oil Imports to Quebec. Quebec IMPORTS over 800,000 barrels of foreign oil per day from murderous, oppressive, human right violating Regimes. 
Not ONE protester on the east coast.

6474 2018-12-07 19:25:33 Peppermint essential oil rubbed into your temples, advil (or w/e med you prefer), water and a nap. I swear by the peppermint oil - its amazing! Doesn't take the whole headache away, but it takes the edge off and allows you to be functional until the meds kick in.
6475 2018-12-07 19:25:26 If your legs are really itchy this winter, take a hot bath. Drop a couple fistfuls of coconut oil into the water as it's filling. The oil will coat your skin better than you can rub it on.

6476 2018-12-07 19:25:22 Don’t ever put olive oil in anything ever because it’s so fucking strong once I made cake with olive oil and it made me vomit olive oil is evil.
6477 2018-12-07 19:25:21 Do they want the Oil going thru downtown Quebec, rail or around the town, pipelines?
Their choice.
6478 2018-12-07 19:25:15 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you? #essentialoils
6479 2018-12-07 19:25:13 Life is rough but at least my oil has been changed so
6480 2018-12-07 19:25:10 Go back to Exxon, Rex.......Just don't help the Russians Drill for Oil.............

6484 2018-12-07 19:24:39 #WhatCanadaLoses is my patience when I see this blatant oil industry propaganda on my Twitter feed.

6487 2018-12-07 19:24:19 And Alberta's oil is up 71% since Sunday and their unemployment rate is down a full percentage. Alberta has got to be happy.
6488 2018-12-07 19:24:17 I can't afford massages so hot baths with epsom salts and essential oil are my muscle therapy.
6489 2018-12-07 19:24:17 They always tryna get you to spend more money when you get an oil change  just do what I told you to do today
6490 2018-12-07 19:23:56 Oil and rubber embargo because Japan invaded the  Philippines
 then embargo japan planned an attack on Pearl Harbor   Fdr let the attack happen so to get the America people a reason to join the war. Fdr also made a deal with the uk if war was won then uk to turn over 100+ bases
6491 2018-12-07 19:23:46 Slap import duties on foreign oil. $2.50\L gas changes peoples interests.
6492 2018-12-07 19:23:41 You mean chicken deepfried in old oil...yack!
6493 2018-12-07 19:23:31 What oil fixes that?
6494 2018-12-07 19:23:07 a recession  will come.  he's foolish,  doesn't care.  he said  himself if stocks fell l000 points in two  days that president shld be impeached..  look it up.  he needs to walk  b4 he kills everyone w/BAD recession, global  warming, fires, oil spills, HUGE unncessary deficit,..
6495 2018-12-07 19:23:06 Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is speaking before leaving the First Ministers Meeting (she has a flight to catch). She says concerns facing oil industry is a crisis, and problems are part of a slow car crash people have been watching for a decade.
6496 2018-12-07 19:23:04 Hence why this current administration is a problem. Taking steps for green energy will simultaneously weaken the need for Saudi Arabia’s oil, that’s all they have to offer the world anyways.
6497 2018-12-07 19:22:48 Sana oil
6498 2018-12-07 19:22:48 Then go back to horse and carriage and all the other little “extras” you get from oil, are these people living in reality or just tossing the middle finger at the rest of Canada because they know Justin will bow to them
6499 2018-12-07 19:22:37 Thank goodness you have olive oil then 
6500 2018-12-07 19:22:37 Fucking sue him, if that was a lot of oil splash youd have lost your fucking face holy shit
6501 2018-12-07 19:22:33 Never forget 12/7/1941, the tragic day the Bush family had to stop selling oil to the Nazis.
6502 2018-12-07 19:22:14 Revolution comes when things start to impact your life in a way, to change it. That's what Dtone HairGain oil does for you. Dtone HairGain Oil is a complete revolution and the best hair oil in the range of Hair Care products.  #hairoil #hair #hairproduct
6503 2018-12-07 19:22:12 I think Alberta needs to stop relying solely on oil and diversify a bit.  The province needs other industries to support it when the price of oil crashes. Separation won't solve anything.
6504 2018-12-07 19:22:04 I know it’s not fancy...but I really like the Bioré Witch Hazel Pore Clarifying Toner. It’s works really well at control oil.
6505 2018-12-07 19:22:04 Yes and if we stopped importing oil from Islamic dictatorships we prob wouldnt have a trade deficit.

Imagine how much less national debt spent on policing corrupt shitholes as well
6506 2018-12-07 19:21:50 I don’t get regular oil which I understand I get synthetic blend it’s 45 to 50 cash son try to tell me I nedd a tire rotation told him their new tires ion nedd it he brings me a total of  70
6507 2018-12-07 19:21:45 That’s nice Hannity.if we go to war with Russia in the Ukraine,With George Soros stirring up all that shit, oil reserve won’t mean a thing.
6508 2018-12-07 19:21:45 OPEC won’t tell how much oil it’s pumping.  Apple won’t tell us how many phones they’re selling.  Before long, the bank won’t tell me how much money’s in my account.

6513 2018-12-07 19:21:09 “Getting your oil changed”?

6514 2018-12-07 19:20:59 The US must hold ALL commodities such as oil and gas.  We must be sure that we can be self-sufficient   If there is another war, our America must be STRONG!
6515 2018-12-07 19:20:58 It says the MCT oil is good for weight loss and provides instant energy.
6516 2018-12-07 19:20:50 Remember Rex violated our sanctions against Russia trying to broker his biggest oil deal ever between Russia and

6519 2018-12-07 19:20:31 CBD oil works wonders.
6520 2018-12-07 19:20:31 There are basket weavers on the streets of Venezuela using cash to weave because it is so worthless. Is this the fault of the people? or billionaire oil companies?   Can you ring a bell to snap out of not seeing this chain of events?
6521 2018-12-07 19:20:18 No positive change will happen. Specially not with people like Trump in power who support them because of f oil and $
6522 2018-12-07 19:20:16 That’s the bit that worried me. As you said it was hot and cooked it for 45 mins. Did you baste in oil?
6523 2018-12-07 19:20:05 Brent oil sit on everything behind this that they go to Azerbeidzjan that country swim in oil. And than can the price lower are....
6524 2018-12-07 19:19:45 As long as it's fresh, you can't go wrong with either bread choice! and infusing your olive oil is just a major pro-move. We like your style, man!
6525 2018-12-07 19:19:33 I'm getting new tires and an oil change, and the mechanics are playing so much Kylie Minogue, bless them
6526 2018-12-07 19:19:33 Omg I’m so quirky! I just accidentally spilled hot oil on my vagina
6527 2018-12-07 19:19:31 Right, because the measly amounts scientists get in government grant money are the corrupting influence, not the fucking billions the oil industry is pumping into the few studies that contradict that vast VAST consensus reached by everyone else.
6528 2018-12-07 19:19:22 Feel free to stop using oil anytime.   And forget about equalization money that comes from oil too!
6529 2018-12-07 19:19:07 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

6540 2018-12-07 19:18:00 Yup. That's the ticket.  Though to be fair, I suspect oil prices may rise again once the Saudis think we've forgotten about how the murdered Khashoggi. But still...

6543 2018-12-07 19:17:58 Maybe our Gov could use $80M a day from oil sales to countries other than the States. Just saying.
6544 2018-12-07 19:17:49 Oil is being a real dick.
6545 2018-12-07 19:17:46 Don’t forget that it was FDRs fault. Japan and the USA we’re friends until FDR cut the oil supply to Japan. That’s why we were attacked.

6548 2018-12-07 19:17:33 Dear Mr. Tillerson,
Too little too late.
Unless you have something tangible to offer to Mueller~we don't need to hear from you now. You made a choicein order to secure your oil interests and now the stink is on you forever.
6549 2018-12-07 19:17:33 Been at the oil change place for like an hour... wtf
6550 2018-12-07 19:17:09 Learning is what is important. 

Leading a lgbtq2 trade mission. 

Yup - I can forgive a pipeline for that. Cause BC is still going to shove the pipeline back into the oil patch. 

@jimcarr_wpg @R_Boissonnault @SeamusORegan
6551 2018-12-07 19:17:03 Again Alberta wants to leave confederation. When the oil was booming you wanted to leave because you wanted to keep all the wealth. Now you want to leave unless you get a hand-out. Ok, leave! What are you going to do when the oil industry dies, are you going to cry that you
6552 2018-12-07 19:17:00 Did you know that oil stains can be removed from the carpet with baking soda?
Oh, baking soda... what CAN'T you do?!
6553 2018-12-07 19:16:55 I get the annual Grammy outrage but it's entirely misplaced. Expecting the pop-dominated Grammy committee to accurately assess the year's heavy metal releases is like expecting a turnip to change the oil in your ride. It just ain't happening and bitching won't change a thing.

The good news is we can drill for more oil.

La disminución de la producción de #Oil  por parte de los principales países productores genera incertidumbre por el comportamiento de la economía mundial.
6558 2018-12-07 19:16:43 For the love of all that is holy. We did NOT export more oil than we imported per EIA end-November report. The “net export” number comes from combining shipments of crude oil and finished fuel. The U.S. is still a net crude oil importer.

6560 2018-12-07 19:16:40 I just want the Venezuelans to get the benefits of the Oil they have available.
Did you know about the 30 year contract the Venezuelans had with the US back in the 20's & 30's?
It was signed up at 70 CENTS a barrel and stayed that way for all 30 years
6561 2018-12-07 19:16:33 There's a freedom of religion in this country. He doesn't have to participate in the stupid ritual. Plus George HW Bush is a warmongering criminal and the gulf war was so he can get rich off of blood and oil.
6562 2018-12-07 19:16:28 I wouldnt call Medicare for All versus "expanded access to affordable private care" minuscule, or the folks trying to charterize public ed, or the general policy of protecting white collar crooks--or people wanting to use Libyan oil to pay for the deficit. Pretty big
6563 2018-12-07 19:16:07 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

6565 2018-12-07 19:15:20 I’ve never made them, but my sister once advised me on substituting oil for butter in pie crusts: butter isn’t pure fat, it has some water in it too. So you may need to add a bit of water or other non-oil liquid for correct texture.
6566 2018-12-07 19:15:17 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this December? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
6567 2018-12-07 19:15:15 【add oil】

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

例 Add oil lor. I'll support you. 頑張れ。応援するよ。
6568 2018-12-07 19:15:14 What I’d like to see on the nightly news when the trading price of oil is shown, show both prices. Show the Texas trading price and then what Alberta is selling its oil at. I think that would help Canadians realized how they’re getting ripped off each day.
6569 2018-12-07 19:15:12 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.

6574 2018-12-07 19:14:44 What is that girl's last name again??? ROMNEY?  Did she see the stock market this week? or see that we had Chinese girl arrested China is never going to get over that. And his buddies Putin & Prince agreed on oil? Since when is Putin part of OPEC?
6575 2018-12-07 19:14:37 #ClimateChange. Arnold Schwarzenegger wishes he could travel back in time so he could stop fossil fuels from being used.

6577 2018-12-07 19:14:34 I would prefer honesty in this discussion.

Our current losses are not about our pipeline delay. KXL is stalled by USA; TMX wouldn't have carried oil to tidewater for another year.

Distorting the issue is best left to the liars on the Opposition side.

Thanks.

6583 2018-12-07 19:13:57 By the way...
There is lots of oil and natural gas.  So much in fact, that the eventual transition does not need to be disruptive.
We can continue to develop technologies and adopt them when they are ready, instead of now.

6587 2018-12-07 19:13:37 3 gotitas de „aceite de árbol de té“ (tea-tree-oil) en medio vaso con agua, gárgaras apenas te levantas, ojo  ni se te ocurra pasar esa gárgara. Después 1cdta miel, jugo de medio limón y 1 pizca de pimienta, todo lo entibias a 15 segundos y tomar a cucharadas. Es lo mejor.
6588 2018-12-07 19:13:35 @ChickenInnZW please stop using cotton cooking oil it's so overwhelmingly terrible bought a 2 piecer pa construction house umm yuck
6589 2018-12-07 19:13:31 LITERALLY erujguig like the hymns we sang are still imprinted on my brain... give me oil in my lamp keep it burning.. give me oil in my lamp i pray....
6590 2018-12-07 19:13:30 Due to the inclement weather, we will be closed tomorrow Saturday, December 8th, 2018. We hope everyone has a wonderful weekend.

6592 2018-12-07 19:13:26 You need that matching everyday dry oil to set it off!
6593 2018-12-07 19:13:25 yes,,but it kind of ruined the big oil deal in africa ,putin,tillerson,trump/.
6594 2018-12-07 19:13:22 If you value future generations quality of life at precisely zero, a huge oil discovery is great news.

But then dont pretend youre a Conservative. Youre a relativist, selfish, entitled Gen-Xer with no sense of responsibility

Burn today, screw tomorrow
6595 2018-12-07 19:13:19 Took my brother’s car to get an oil change and paid for it
6596 2018-12-07 19:13:02 Imagine where we'd be without trudeau. If the people can push through a sluggish economy, rising taxes, bad trade, failing oil industry, tightening regulations and some national embarrassments we could've truly achieved something. Our engineers are fleeing, good luck  2019
6597 2018-12-07 19:12:57 おれもさ、ﾄﾞﾊﾞｧと行きたい日もあるわけよ。。
6598 2018-12-07 19:12:50 Well, they side with their Big Coal and Oil lobbyists who fill their campaign coffers... They don't REALLY believe it's not real.
6599 2018-12-07 19:12:50 #gold and #oil up so a fine day it is friends! @CoryGroshek @DanielaCambone @renegadestyle @GratkeWealth @TorenRainaud @LaurieInMadison @lance1030
6600 2018-12-07 19:12:45 this morning i started the first day of using bio oil and let me tell you it’s extremely triggers to have to rub oil into my fat and stretch marks wow 
6601 2018-12-07 19:12:43 Kim is beholden to big oil now too?
6602 2018-12-07 19:12:39 Why else would you be Saudi's BFF? Why else did Saudi Arabia have you back out of Iran agreement and reimpose sanctions? Oh, aren't we punishing countries for buying Iran oil? Oh, MAYBE to reduce available oil so Saudi can make more on theirs.
6603 2018-12-07 19:12:37 This is just the warm up act
Wait until we hit @casapiolas on 22nd December 
6604 2018-12-07 19:12:36 So I'm exploring options for other mechanics but the oil change squad smelled burning in my car and thought it might be something sticking. As such I am going to need to take it in, but I can't get it in until next week. Means going to Newark for Rivs now unlikely. ><
6605 2018-12-07 19:12:34 There are ZERO facts to back up your assertion that "oil pipelines always leak eventually." This is a foolish statement and really serves to underscore the fact that more education on these issues needs to be done. I don't blame you for your ignorance. Actually I do. #FactsMatter
6606 2018-12-07 19:12:33 Your reaction to France resembles your reaction to tweets by those with fewer followers than you. Those of us that cannot so easy dismiss deniers know that, even with deniers, there is room for agreement. I have found that deniers often hate oil companies. What do Fr frmrs hate?
6607 2018-12-07 19:12:33 we stan needing air filter replacements when getting an oil change dont we ladies 
6608 2018-12-07 19:12:29 I’ve been waiting on tobacco to buy into this. Wish oil would do this with clean energy.
6609 2018-12-07 19:12:23 Obama is typical of Bill Clinton... taking credit for other peoples policies..   Bill cliinton rode Ronald Reagan's coattails.. he admitted it.  Obama had a GOP congress his last 4 years in office. His stock market was carried mostly by big oil who he campaigned against!!!
6610 2018-12-07 19:12:20 He has ties to James Baker who is trying to help trump cover up th Russian oil scandal. More gop corruption.
6611 2018-12-07 19:12:17 I got 3 points once for being over the speed limit. Should i claim treatment as a 2nd class citizen and statutory sectarianism even though i broke the law? I worry for anyone believing this snake oil nonsense. Resubmit a PA and get it approved like anyone else. Problem solved.
6612 2018-12-07 19:12:09 In the current economic environment to have BC and Quebec helping damage the economy of another province is unacceptable.  What do they want? Foreign oil is ok? We are either a nation or we are not. If not, then SK & Alberta need to seek options.
6613 2018-12-07 19:11:58 Fair question, but when Trump tells Tillerson that he wants to kill ISIS insurgents and their families and then take all of Iraq's oil revenue to pay for it, I don't think you have to go into alot of details around which specific laws/treaties would be violated by doing so.
6614 2018-12-07 19:11:50 Your drive in 1972 was before the gulf state oil embargo of the US and the spike in oil prices. Also during a time of fear of a coming ice age, global cooling rather than warming.
6615 2018-12-07 19:11:37 But what made you pick oil industry? Because you cant just short any 2nd lower high. Also oil stocks had a nice bullish gap this morning. Honestly, I was looking for $EWZ to go long but it was up like 10% so I passed.
6616 2018-12-07 19:11:34 Palliative care theme over the two days. Case studies from both nurse and play specialist. Voice of the child session from psychologist. Cannabis oil research. Performances from @CLICSargent young people music programme. Can send you agenda and speaker details if you want.
6617 2018-12-07 19:11:29 We don’t need their oil anyway. We should transition to electric and hybrid anyway.
6618 2018-12-07 19:11:16 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
6619 2018-12-07 19:11:15 like, the instructions on the bottles always say use a carrier oil and they usually give recs of which oils work best with EO.
6620 2018-12-07 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: sad crust with fresh coconut oil and Italian sausage.
6621 2018-12-07 19:11:05 Shea butter pre poo, shampoo, conditioner, protein treatment, hot oil treatment, deep conditioner in that order bih
6622 2018-12-07 19:11:05 Baked potatoes could be used for oil spills.
6623 2018-12-07 19:11:03 As a net exporter, $50-60/barrel is the sweetspot for USA oil producers. That keeps gas prices relatively low, and sector employment robust.
6624 2018-12-07 19:10:50 The way my CGPA is going down, it will soon discover oil !
#weekendvibes #SaturdayThoughts
6625 2018-12-07 19:10:50 BREAKING: $AAPL hits 6 month low, Dow -528, Huawei exec at a bail hearing about to be extradited to the US, Oil +2.5% on @OPEC+(Russia) goes cray-cray , announces it'll cut output by 1.2mbp in Jan. The  one thing you can count on? @ClamanCountdown to get you thru it 3pET!
6626 2018-12-07 19:10:49 Waiting for Dodge to finish my oil change and watching the Real... I’ve never sat and watched this shit and they are hilarious 
6627 2018-12-07 19:10:44 Something is wrong with you . 
You are NOT an oil corp ceo. 
Fire Zinke
6628 2018-12-07 19:10:33 i’m not betting on it. since u already know a good source from Spain, u’r way better off than most people. this assumes olive oil works for u.
6629 2018-12-07 19:10:25 Theres free energy everywhere Nikola Tesla figured that out long ago. But hard to make oil profits when theres free energy to be had. All you climate change people are fighting the wrong fight. The global powers that be count on your compassion for the environment. And take your$
6630 2018-12-07 19:10:23 At least I’m not the only female here getting an oil change 
6631 2018-12-07 19:10:22 The body may belong the  caesar but the spirit remains free. You are not the body, you use the body by way of making contracts. Like the contract you made when you got your last oil change/blood transfusion.
6632 2018-12-07 19:10:19 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
6633 2018-12-07 19:10:18 Way to false advertise the new "raid", gotta sell the snake oil season pass somehow
6634 2018-12-07 19:10:15 Greg, I’m looking for a post I think you did recently...oil peak vs natgas peak vs copper peak(I think) in last two downturns.  Can you help me find that one if that was yours?  Thanks a bunch.
6635 2018-12-07 19:10:15 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this December? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!

6637 2018-12-07 19:10:12 Yoo niggas really tired to get me for a oil change today noww ima just do it myself
6638 2018-12-07 19:10:09 Step 2: How to Make Cake Balls
Start by making cake balls that you will apply to sticks later to turn them into pops. Follow the directions for making your box cake mix, making one alteration. Use half the amount of vegetable oil.
6639 2018-12-07 19:10:05 What is racist in what I wrote? That they are *desert Bedouins* or that they primarily had oil to live of off until recently?
6640 2018-12-07 19:10:05 Yaaaaas
6641 2018-12-07 19:10:03 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。

6645 2018-12-07 19:09:45 Same thing for oil spills and any other disaster that results in an emotional rather than business response. #PickTheBones
6646 2018-12-07 19:09:39 Which essential oil makes your bank account not negative anymore?
6647 2018-12-07 19:09:35 Our 3 largest sources of employment are oil (volatile); Finance (driven to England by the loss of the BoE LOLR) and Govt. Given the loss of tax revenue from Finance and the loss of fiscal xfrs from the rUK, Gov't will have to shrink. So where is this growth going to come from?
6648 2018-12-07 19:09:31 Are you giving a bottle to each staff member @great_oil ?  If so,  got any jobs   Happy Christmas y Feliz Navidad
6649 2018-12-07 19:09:23 why?  probably because they don't have oil underneath.
6650 2018-12-07 19:09:23 yeah u know what, show me jobs without oil and maybe you'll get some respect.
6651 2018-12-07 19:09:23 T-V-Oil?
6652 2018-12-07 19:09:21 They would stop needing our water and elecrticity or oil and gas then.
Our media are a digrace and something must be done.
6653 2018-12-07 19:09:17 Big Oil owns big solar and big wind it's all one big monopoly genius! The only reason we're moving to electric cars is to impose minimalism and control through "Electric Grid" on the American people! it has nothing to do with the environment! Gas is freedom! Electric controlled!

6656 2018-12-07 19:09:07 We also purchase oil from Canada,Mexico,Iraq, Venezuela
6657 2018-12-07 19:09:01 Its rather funny, actually. The Left purportedly hates fossil fuels, but the Dems who just stormed to governance here in a Blue Wave are equally thrilled with the additional funds from oil development this will bring to government programs.
6658 2018-12-07 19:09:01 No, he is not he's a snake oil salesman.
6659 2018-12-07 19:09:00 If I had canna oil I’d put them in these -if possible -
6660 2018-12-07 19:08:53 Anything Trudumb has done is PURELY symbolic, He is on record as saying that oil and gas need to be phased out...his chief advisor is on record even more vocally opposing all oil sands development...they WILL NOT do anything to improve oil flow in Canada!
6661 2018-12-07 19:08:44 A man knows who his heart belongs to. So you can cook his food with Diamond oil & do backflips on his dick but if it ain't you, it ain't you,
6662 2018-12-07 19:08:35 If it costs a company more to run the company because oil  prices are changing then it sounds like it would affect the share price.
#StockMarket
6663 2018-12-07 19:08:25 Reduce the population? Your solution is what, then? The only way to save us is to do EVERYTHING. We need to cut oil, cut carbon emissions, cut, cut, cut, or else we’re done. Without that, we. all. die. The science is pretty clear.
6664 2018-12-07 19:08:19 I don't mean indicators. What am I not seeing that may be so blatantly obvious to someone like you? Does a small retail trader like me need to concern myself with Europe and Asia's markets? Do I need to find correlations between the S&P and Crude Oil? Technical analysis aside
6665 2018-12-07 19:08:13 "I am a proud Scot but we all know that Scots would starve to death in the dark without the nice English to give us all that dosh (having nothing to do with our oil, water, gas, etc) just out of the well known kindness of their hearts."
6666 2018-12-07 19:08:08 Let's see. We could sell them oil and gas, cereal crops, beef, potash and oh yeah uranium. For a start and at a premium. Think they'd miss us then?
6667 2018-12-07 19:08:08 Ironically, I was waiting for an oil change. Jiffy Lube. lololol.
6668 2018-12-07 19:08:05 He's one of the last real republicans. He did a lot of shady things wrt oil profits, but all in all he meant well I think.

6672 2018-12-07 19:07:55 hot tips for anyone who’s feeling under the weather during this cold and flu season: 

• eucalyptus oil in an essential oil diffuser does WONDERS for a stuffy nose
• peppermint oil helps with headaches and stomach aches/nausea
• lavender oil can help with cough and congestion
6673 2018-12-07 19:07:41 St Vincent de Paul are able to provide heating oil in Northern Ireland so I am hoping they can provide gas/electricity for those in need in Wales, Scotland and England.  Worth a try.
6674 2018-12-07 19:07:40 Maybe they could clean up oil spills with some of them nice potats?
6675 2018-12-07 19:07:38

6676 2018-12-07 19:07:33 It’s disgusting that the Koch bros, the Mercers, the Saudis, Russia & Israel (& more) are all playing a huge game of Stratego, moving pieces all over the board as if real people were just plastic - plastic made from the oil that poisons our planet.  Grow hemp!
6677 2018-12-07 19:07:29 It is dangerous to sleep with the enemy.Saudis entire strategy is to rule the world by spreading religion , multiplying and ruling most of the world after oil is depleted.
6678 2018-12-07 19:07:21 Whats Whole Plant Medical Cannabis do you mean just Cannabis or different type of oil 
6679 2018-12-07 19:07:19 I don't want the oil, only bud
6680 2018-12-07 19:07:18 I usually eat Season brand in Extra Virgin olive oil. I also like King Oscar

 No one knows or at least has  said what happened.
6687 2018-12-08 23:59:26 Under his "plan" we wouldn't be number one in oil production,we wouldn't have a growing economy,jobs, low gas prices,profitable coal mines or affordable health insurance...not even "crumbs".

6723 2018-12-08 23:57:17 Buon Natale from Panza’s Tasting Italy! Grab a bite of Italian for dinner, or pick up everything you need to make your own feast at home. Olive oil, pesto, pasta and more!

6726 2018-12-08 23:57:17 Tracked and tamed Treble and Rush, a couple of mechanowolves that are invisible and only trackable via puddles of oil they drop. #Warcraft
6727 2018-12-08 23:57:13 No you didn’t join the army because you couldn’t hack it!i joined in 2002 and I’m damn proud of it! Fought in that war for oil and I did what my commander and chief told me!
6728 2018-12-08 23:57:09 I wouldn’t compare meth to hair oil or whatever. I’m curious about Kail’s hair stuff. If Chelsea uses it and likes it, I might try it.

Give me a gift guide for THAT kind of dad.

6735 2018-12-08 23:56:48 Our Canadian “niceness” is what caused our oil to be landlocked. Not condoning violence but the protests have been effective in Paris and if Macron goes one cannot deny they were a success. Sometimes revolutions are required to drain establishment?

6737 2018-12-08 23:56:18 The US is now the worlds largest producer of oil and gas. Trump wants to increase energy exports to Europe. Definitely not good for Russia's economy.
6738 2018-12-08 23:56:17 Rachel is doing her job by scrambling to serve Albertans and O&G companies. Kudos to Rachel. She wasn't in power the last 50 yrs while O&G CO's and past govt's enjoyed the easy US markets, ignoring need for pipes, critical now US is oil exporter. Where's the Heritage Trust Fund?
6739 2018-12-08 23:56:13 Your mum lives of benefits allow mate , also can guarantee you i can buy your generation i have very good oil and i sell camels

6741 2018-12-08 23:55:57 How about we figure out a way to use wind & solar energy instead? Wait a minute,..... they don’t pay as well as oil. Hmmmmm.....
6742 2018-12-08 23:55:51 We received a box of assorted oil oils from @amazon at home today. Neither Sherri or I ordered it and it came with no note. So, thanks to whoever sent us assorted olive oils!

6747 2018-12-08 23:55:14 that’s the thing! i was going 15 under bc of the rain and my truck started spinning so fast outta nowhere we had to have hit an oil patch
6748 2018-12-08 23:55:11 Hopefully not , it’s not like we are playing against a country with oil or subs worth £45 million is it ?  it’s boss cos we’re doing it the right way for now

6754 2018-12-08 23:54:23 Anyone remember the “Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t” from Pompeo? Sounds like 45 has what he wants now. Didn’t like oil man, but hard to tell which is worse.

6756 2018-12-08 23:53:54 CBD oil gives me a little extra relief for chronic pain. Cannabis does offer better but it makes me feel sick, just my luck. I wholeheartedly agree that it should be legalised and every part of the plant is useful

6762 2018-12-08 23:53:30 I never thought I'd see the day when a former oil executive call the Republican president he used to work for a moron, but the devil's bargain the GOP has made will tear that party down.

6767 2018-12-08 23:53:03 Right. And if $54 isn’t low enough for the POTUS would any of the LA press be inspired to ask how low would he like to see it go? $44? $34? $24? Lower? Are the folks at LA Mid-Continent Oil&Gas, LABI, and LOGA up in arms? Haven’t heard anything from them either. Strange.

6771 2018-12-08 23:52:31 If we do it will just elevate us back to where we should be, top of the pile! You see all this recent success you've had since the oil money poured in is all new to your lot. But for us success is in our DNA & has been for many many, decades. You just gonna have to deal with it!

6790 2018-12-08 23:50:57 And, just curious, what happens when the oil runs out?  What happens to our children?
6791 2018-12-08 23:50:49 just means some of us will have to spend time filtering more email and re-directing ore calls as the "oil salesmen" come a Calvin' to cure our ills.

6803 2018-12-08 23:49:13 They both profited from oil and gas so what’s your point ?
6804 2018-12-08 23:49:09 I usually don’t believe in that holistic shit tbh but CBD oil is probably the best thing to happen to me this week.
6805 2018-12-08 23:48:54 Good point. The bottom line is that we must get money out of politics & creating ad campaigns that are lies should be punishable. The oil companies lied shamelessly to defeat Measure G here, for example, under the protection of freedom of speech.

6810 2018-12-08 23:48:35 Yeah, what kind of leftie cares about the needs of the "working class"? They selfishly & short-sightedly just want to put food on the table. Progressives should hang with loftier-minded sophisticates like Oprah & George Clooney and bank CEOs and oil barons to fix things.

6815 2018-12-08 23:47:52 It also takes oil to build and transport solar panels.

6817 2018-12-08 23:47:42 honestly an awful use of my time but something that would maybe be a tremendously relaxing day: downloading that Jump app, taking some oil and rereading like ten years of naruto
6818 2018-12-08 23:47:39 And enemy of animals, did you ever watch them videos where they skin dogs alive than they throw them in boiling oil  they are heartless 
6819 2018-12-08 23:47:38 which essential oil is good for getting through a 15 page paper without having a break down ?
6820 2018-12-08 23:47:34 I was wondering what grade of oil you fried the samosas in. Now I know!
6821 2018-12-08 23:47:33 The whole thing is being astroturfed by rightwing nationalists taking advantage of a small movement nominally progressive, but really about not wanting to pay more for oil. Basically it's France being France and no one in the US seems to understand that. It's all very annoying.
6822 2018-12-08 23:47:22 CBD oil is a godsend. My upper lip was ravaged from the cold, and I forgot I had some lotion and chapsticks from @WhimsicalLather with CBD oil in them. Couldn't find where I stashed the chapsticks, but found my lotion. Twenty minutes later, and I am no longer in pain.
6823 2018-12-08 23:47:21 Waste of Oil Money uno 
6824 2018-12-08 23:47:16 Where did he say to use oil?
6825 2018-12-08 23:47:14 Let's say you strike oil in your backyard like the Beverly Hillbillies. You can't use that oil to power your vehicle without building an oil refinery. Compare that to charging your car via solar energy, which just requires the sun and panels... 
6826 2018-12-08 23:47:05 きゅうだと嬉しいですが、でも面倒なのでどちらでも大丈夫ですよー！(*´ｪ`*)こちらではたくさん絡みたいと思ってますので…！！！どうぞよろしくお願いします…！！！

6828 2018-12-08 23:46:45 Oh, great, we can create a new kind of cancer to go with it. Perhaps curtailing carbon emissions, converting gas and oil to solar and wind would help......oh, and eliminating crazy people from office in the USA would be helpful as well.
6829 2018-12-08 23:46:41 Lmao yeah a realist who wants to invest in a pipeline with super low oil prices. While Irving pays the lowest taxes on refineries in the country and I pay 30% of my paycheck. No please give more of my money to the Irvings

6831 2018-12-08 23:46:33 Lowered sales are going to happen anyway in petroleum and you are aware of predicted reduced demand ... it being inevitable

The carbon tax 'theory model' you are talking up is more about a prop financally to the dwindling oil industry 

Which will die off sooner not later
6832 2018-12-08 23:46:31 You understand that because we don’t have pipelines we are currently selling our oil for $26 / barrel.  And Eastern Canada is importing Saudi oil for $59 / barrel.
6833 2018-12-08 23:46:29 As much as it’s not allowed due to having an oil country’s £ behind ya , you should also look out for a red team who’s top of the league ...
6834 2018-12-08 23:46:21 People need to continue to use more biofuels, like ethanol and biodiesel, to offset the economic power of oil. In addition, we must also decrease our use of fossil fuels used by the government as well; such as ending Saturday mail delivery.
6835 2018-12-08 23:46:19 OIL be damned, how on earth did they do that....
6836 2018-12-08 23:46:17 Check your Engine oil today.
6837 2018-12-08 23:46:13 Naw thanks , keep your hydro, and your Saudi oil traitor ... BTW any chance you Franco,s could make it on your own instead if relying on government handouts , and Equalization payments  courtesy of AB & Sask...

Essential oil
6843 2018-12-08 23:45:36 Thanks so much. I heard cbd oil has many uses & actually works. Does the cbd come in a pill form or just the oil?
6844 2018-12-08 23:45:35 るちおぱよーーー！！！！てでし楽しんできてねーー！(*´ｪ`*)
6845 2018-12-08 23:45:22 Do love a chilli oil...
6846 2018-12-08 23:45:17 I insist you're correct
6847 2018-12-08 23:45:16 Good on Brett! I fully agree with you but they don’t care because the most populated provinces don’t care about the oil. They are playing politics
6848 2018-12-08 23:45:08 Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
6849 2018-12-08 23:44:59 Using sesame oil? Looks delish...I had a greenie this morning
6850 2018-12-08 23:44:06 Once he gets the ditch done there won’t be a pipeline it. He doesn’t care for the movement of Oil.

6852 2018-12-08 23:43:59 That makes £590 billion before even selling oil to other countries. That is why they do not want Scotland to go. As the oil is put into petrol, diesel, jet fuel etc. That the government makes various taxes, corporation vat etc. That is just for UK alone our oil profits that.
6853 2018-12-08 23:43:36 The ultimate resource is human ingenuity, which is not finite. Silicon was just a worthless substance until someone figured out how to use it in computers. People have been predicting we are running out of oil for decades, yet there are more proven resources than ever.
6854 2018-12-08 23:43:35 Avocado oil
6855 2018-12-08 23:43:12 The oil workers probably hate it at that price though
6856 2018-12-08 23:43:08 Or we could ask Sterling seeing as it was right in his ear.
6857 2018-12-08 23:42:50 Changing your oil in cold weather is a bitch 
6858 2018-12-08 23:42:46 By the way, if you do the Toad in the Hole, just briefly put the vegan sausages in the oil so that they are covered and then pour the batter straight on top. We found  that cooking for ten mins first led to them being well over-cooked & a bit like cardboard!

6860 2018-12-08 23:42:41 #bbcqt  Ian Blackford portrait Scotland as environmentally sensible but his country wants an economy based on Oil and Gas export - that should be included in the Scottish Zero CO2 calculation!
6861 2018-12-08 23:42:38 Why not protest Saudi oil tankers more impact than TMX. Why not protest dumping raw sewage. Hypocrites

6863 2018-12-08 23:42:16 Words are never just words, but what matters is getting to the meanings behind them and understanding which meaning is intended. The Bible most definitely is not just words, it is deep and very important meanings.

Also I do not use "just words" every word I use means something.

6865 2018-12-08 23:41:53 Nigeria naira had been weaking but nothing to show for it.
We devalued our Naira export revenue did not have any Significant improvement.
we need INDUSTRIALIZATION not manipulation of FX market.
Egypt refine more Crude than Nigeria that has all the Oil in Africa.
Egypt don't
6866 2018-12-08 23:41:50 His experience with Exxon and Russian oil is exactly why he was chosen.
6867 2018-12-08 23:41:43 Most things of value have an unknown or seemingly unlimited supply: gold, oil, apples, water, etc. Finite supply is not required for value definitions.
6868 2018-12-08 23:41:25 Don't try lying calling what's happening "Antisemitism", call it by its real name "economic crisis", a crisis engendered by zionist leadership decision making. We got you on tape Netanyahu. You were the one demanding sanctions on Iranian oil.
6869 2018-12-08 23:41:19 someone needs to enplane to me why we are exporting oil , while we are importing oil. it makes no sense at all to me. unless its all a racket, i still love and support our President
6870 2018-12-08 23:41:18 A good dose Castor oil would do job.
Worked miracles few years ago.
6871 2018-12-08 23:41:17 Christian don’t slander people, lie daily, and show racist habits regularly. Associate with criminals, or ignore murder, for oil.
Nothing in the Bible implies someone with his habits as Christian. More like Pontuis Pilate!
6872 2018-12-08 23:41:11 Carbon taxes will always be regressive when paired with continued subsidies to big oil

6882 2018-12-08 23:40:32 In May 2011, the country became a net exporter of refined petroleum products. As of 2014, the United States was the world's third-largest producer of crude oil, after Saudi Arabia and Russia and second largest exporter of refined products, after Russia.

6884 2018-12-08 23:40:22 Norway plus is a utiopia without any reality in it. Mostly because UK is not a 6 milllion people country with oil and trillions of €  in backup funds.
6885 2018-12-08 23:40:19 We refine lots here and a new refinery just came online after years of building - Northwest Refinery. The issue is that our customers (US and Asian refiners) really want the oil, especially heavy oil. We just can’t get it there (other than trains which is a terrible solution)
6886 2018-12-08 23:40:12 Preparing one of my favorite Moroccan dishes tonight.
Whenever I do this, I wish food shows had “Smell-O-Vision”.

The scent of the onion and chili paste hitting the sesame oil is so delicious.

6889 2018-12-08 23:40:00 Does it have coconut oil in it? Cuz my hair can’t do that
6890 2018-12-08 23:39:28 Wow! 

Garlic does that, too, when you pickle it or immerse it in oil. It's also good to eat that way, and I've used it to great effect in making food more fascinating.
6891 2018-12-08 23:39:20 Got any biode for glad wrap. Also need biofuel from gutter oil and palm or even algae
6892 2018-12-08 23:39:13 Because they still give big oil subsidies. So we’re effectively paying oil companies twice; you arrogant intellectually lazy smearmerchant.

You’re an embarrassment to progressive ideals and a Neoliberal hitman in fact
6893 2018-12-08 23:39:12 Just a simple BBQ chicken, cold can of Dr Pepper and a DVD of my favourite friends episodes. I don’t know what fanny batter is but it sounds like it involves vegetable oil

6896 2018-12-08 23:38:05 They tell me Quebec doesn't buy Saudi oil.  US, Algeria, Norway, Venezuala, Nigeria ...

 Have you seen different?

6898 2018-12-08 23:37:55 I’m so tired now. I think I’m going to sleep with this coconut oil in my hair. I don’t have enough energy to wash it out

6900 2018-12-08 23:37:50 similart to the gear oil in the transmission.
6901 2018-12-08 23:37:46 Ogbeni, it was a fake float. The banks were propping up the Egyptian pound. It didn't work. Just like Emefiele and Buhari were spending $$$ to "defend the naira" even though crude oil price had dropped & we didn't have as much $$$ as we used to have.
6902 2018-12-08 23:37:43 Steal the oil from countries we invade?
6903 2018-12-08 23:37:42 It's easy economics: Wallstreet companies want cheap resources (oil, metals, ...) to maximize their profit, from 3-rd world nations.

So they hate socialist and nationalist governments, who nationalize these resources, for their own profit.

6907 2018-12-08 23:37:15 100% agree ex Labour support SNP. There's more Tories in Scotland than Labour. But lets be truly independent we don't need to go cap in hand to EU we own all the oil, renewables, whiskey and fish. And if you want independence from the Tories better pick up a gun.

6916 2018-12-08 23:36:09 I have been telling people about this since over 2 years, worker coop based factories for batteries and solar panels, training for young, local food farms and hemp.
I have presented this to a professional school in Switzerland and teachers and staff were +, Oil Lobby said NO.
6917 2018-12-08 23:35:00 This club near my house is playing "one corner" I am tempted to run to my parents room and hug their bed and do the dance but, I don't want 100 prayer points with olive oil on my head
merciless beating and yab

6918 2018-12-08 23:34:26 I take it you don't realize that oil jobs are delivered by oil companies and they slashed them to compete globally.

6931 2018-12-08 23:32:46 To anyone following all this on facebook in France, it's bleeding obvious that Putin's trolls are pouring oil on the flames - if not orchestrating the whole show. Yes, the French have a tradition of protest; but this level of hysteria about a relatively minor tax hike is new.
6932 2018-12-08 23:32:45 Oil is a finite resource and there is more value in keeping it in the US to produce downstream products.
6933 2018-12-08 23:32:44 I’d like JT to subject the oil that feeds their refineries to a “gender analysis”.
6934 2018-12-08 23:32:41 Terrible idea. Especially when you have foreign ministers and spies calling out the climate change being used to scam taxpayer money and drive up oil prices.
6935 2018-12-08 23:32:34 Coming from a man that person of low values that polluted the planet and killed for oil

6942 2018-12-08 23:30:40 I don't believe in the Paris Accords since they do Jack Shit and emissions are changing.  You are believing Davos lip service.  Most of the countries saying Oui Oui are bombing the shit out of Oil Countries.  Swiss are siging and taking that pen and jamming it up your Ass.  Davos
6943 2018-12-08 23:30:31 Russia needs to be stopped, they want the entire black Sea, they want to control the entire region- why, to control oil prices and supplies, no, I'll go.. to keep pootins filth out of Norway hell yes.
6944 2018-12-08 23:30:29 Trudeau is practicing the politics of division. East v west, Muslims v those against M103 etc. Pull your head out of the oil sands and you’ll see we are on the same side.
6945 2018-12-08 23:30:29 Went to get an oil change today. Dude asked me if I was 22. Just to think a few years ago people were still asking me if I was in high school. This is a huge step  #turning27inafewmonths

6950 2018-12-08 23:29:15 Fun fact: There's only two oil-producing countries who are actively engaged in reducing their oil production. Venezuela - through corruption and incompetence (not necessarily in that order) and Canada - through stupidity and misplaced vanity. #TeamTrudeau is #ChavismoNorte
6951 2018-12-08 23:29:14 I’d like to know exactly how Trump controls any oil whatsoever.

6959 2018-12-08 23:28:26 I am glad you wrote this.  People don't understand you need a BLOCK heater to keep your engine and oil warm on your car or it won't run.  I lived in Minnesota for 3years no intention of going back too damn cold.  And don't forget black ice that is all over the place.
6960 2018-12-08 23:28:23 What oil is it, my daughters dog needs it. Thanks
6961 2018-12-08 23:28:22 The fact is that the oil & gas industry is an important part of Canada's economy, and it's also true that Canada would get along just fine without it.

6963 2018-12-08 23:27:52 I was on the side of Quebec in recovery of the millions racked up by illegal border jumpers. After Legault's comments re oil and pipelines, Quebec can go fuck themselves. I hope they go broke and get overrun by illegals. You don't wanna be part of Canada,  go screw off.

Bay of Pigs, Contras, Chavez, Current Oil Prices killing Venezuela and Iran and let's not forget Voice of American I  took Perspectives in Global Health at Harvard.  It was a fiercely anti-American communist manifesto delivered by tenured professors and their TAs
6969 2018-12-08 23:26:49 They’ll ignore his humanitarian work and focus on his “failures” as president: The recession, oil crisis and hostage crisis, whereas they ignored Bush’s failures and crimes and focused on his personality.
6970 2018-12-08 23:26:44 I remember watching a video on the TV show “that’s incredible” I think where a guy ate small engine plane engine. He dipped the bolts and stuff in motor oil so they went down better.

6981 2018-12-08 23:24:55 Pay attention to what’s going on then. They are desperate right now and need their oil to get the province rolling again. They do have other resources. Grain, natural gas etc. If you think they’re a one trick pony you need to catch up.

6983 2018-12-08 23:24:47 Being white is wild... I’m in a store tasting different types of olive oil and vinegar
6984 2018-12-08 23:24:33 Sadly we rely on trucks to transport food,other things. These workers are stuck. No alternative fuel but I suspect there could be but won't until the last drop of oil is pumped.
6985 2018-12-08 23:24:27 Did the price of oil not recently grammatically increase because of ummm government action?
6986 2018-12-08 23:24:07 regarding this, i check to see if the stuff was fried in the same oil as meat good and if it is the same oil, i don’t eat it.
6987 2018-12-08 23:24:00 France produces zero oil.....
6988 2018-12-08 23:23:58 No, I mean he regularly shills for them, and that's his shtick with NRO, and that's what he does for a living.  He presents a specific perspective that is very pro-corporate, very pro-gas and oil industry, and even pro-coal, and that's exactly what he's paid to do--by NRO.
6989 2018-12-08 23:23:53 I suppose so, but try to keep it clean. Be careful with the flour and oil…
6990 2018-12-08 23:23:51 Trump & Republicna Party telling their Voters . At the rate of using billions gallions of clean water is used in frxcking oil & gas .

6991 2018-12-08 23:23:42 I do remember.  I didn't see a courgette or avacodo until my 20s.  We bought olive oil from a chemist.  A banana was a treat and we had tangerines at Christmas.
6992 2018-12-08 23:23:39 Shit a oil change, put air in this tire too while they at it 
6993 2018-12-08 23:23:38 We usually use both........ but like some ppl say this is a gourmet dinner....... so olive oil it is.
6994 2018-12-08 23:23:21 The majority of Venezuela’s economy is still private and it’s economic failures are because of its reliance on oil.
6995 2018-12-08 23:23:13 I know right, what the fuck is oil pulling mouthwash and why do they need it 
6996 2018-12-08 23:22:20 Jamaican black castor oil, massage it into your scalp for 5mins. You might need to mix it with something like olive oil or coconut oil because it’s really heavy. I put it on just as is because my hair is coarse and thick but you can leave it as a 20min or even overnight treatment

6998 2018-12-08 23:22:02 I just don't believe that Alberta doesn't believe that oil will become obsolete and would be dumb enough to make a deal with trump of all ppl lol and potentially fuck themselves over going forward that's a catastrophic risk and I don't believe they'll do it
6999 2018-12-08 23:21:57 Tryna get that coconut oil rub down...  I need it.  
7000 2018-12-08 23:21:52 EW EW EW EW. THIS IS DISGUSTING. WHY IS GOGETA COVERED IN OIL
7001 2018-12-08 23:21:43 Come 2019, ima be on 100% Vitamin E oil. Fooled me this year with “extracts of soybean” bs
7002 2018-12-08 23:21:39 If it had been sitting a long time, the oil had drained completely from the top part, where you could expect the tapping noise until everything got oiled.
7003 2018-12-08 23:21:33 Si pendejo es verdad que el capwell estaba vacio y la razón fué porque emelec era el menos opcionado por ser campeón bobazoooo
7004 2018-12-08 23:21:16 Oil and water
7005 2018-12-08 23:21:07 If Alberta thinks an independent oil-based economy is the way to go in the 21st century, good luck with that. The solution to Alberta’s problems is not bitching about why the feds don’t support their oil policies. It’s weening itself off oil. Even the Saudis realize this.
7006 2018-12-08 23:21:01 When you copy assignment but don't want the teacher to know
7007 2018-12-08 23:21:00 Too tight fi go in they oil it up!!!!
7008 2018-12-08 23:20:59 Those are the only options you think? Burn more oil or kill the birds 
7009 2018-12-08 23:20:58 Of all the candidates in the 2018 elections, Beto took the second most money from Big Oil, and a lot from military contractors. The. End.
7010 2018-12-08 23:20:54 Maybe that's why it tastes crap. Palm oil is obviously yummy 
7011 2018-12-08 23:20:46 They're supposed to have stopped that, and it may be true because Saudi Arabis has just signed a big oil deal with Russia and they are not using U,.S. Dollars.  Ouch! That's gotta hurt.
7012 2018-12-08 23:20:36 On the list of bad things, where does oil in the bottom of a toaster fall?

...kids...
7013 2018-12-08 23:20:12 This time we'll use a thin oil, and I've thinned the paint down and you can too.
7014 2018-12-08 23:20:11 @iamspanishdoll @AvaAddams & @ANGELAWHITE  and lots of oil
7015 2018-12-08 23:20:11 Do they have their own policy when it comes to CBD oil and medical marijuana #Probably
7016 2018-12-08 23:20:06 Oil and gas are a vital part of our economy but we seem to be beating our heads against a wall trying to figure out a better way of managing our resources. Why we're not refining more of it here is beyond me. I also don't believe that future demand is going to mimic the past.
7017 2018-12-08 23:20:05 Have you ever considered CBD Oil? A lot of our followers benefit from taking CBD for anxiety.
7018 2018-12-08 23:20:05 And I'm the oil in that pan, hot as fuck 
7019 2018-12-08 23:20:00 Nice one 
7020 2018-12-08 23:19:54 Looking at the last few years, my observation is that tax positioning has a big effect on pricing this time of year. Eg) CPG is trading in huge volume over the past 10 trading days. It fits your thesis of a valuation gap between Canadian oil prices versus share price.
7021 2018-12-08 23:19:40 can somebody who spends more than 100$ a week on essential oil tell me if my horoscope says I should gamble money on football tomorrow

7025 2018-12-08 23:19:18 So Ontario WON'T meet the 2030 levels outlined by Paris? Where's @JustinTrudeau & @cathmckenna  on this target? Way to change the narrative away from the oil field disaster JT caused. Ford success bad, AB job loss good, right?

7027 2018-12-08 23:19:10 Trump right..Macron wrong...
..you know the planet needs alternative fuels and clean energy..till then we need affordable gasoline...
.prolly could do more right now except that would mothball all those super oil tankers..and those jobs..
Plus, what the middle east gonna export ?
7028 2018-12-08 23:19:09 Sorry to say college sports (which I love) is also a culprit.
7029 2018-12-08 23:19:05 Soak cotton balls in peppermint oil and stuff them in your desk drawers or the little bugger will make a nest in there and piss and shit on everything...happened to me at work. He shred all my post it notes too
7030 2018-12-08 23:19:04 Last I read 59 First Nations were against it in BC and Alta, 45 or so for it. 
How did it go over building a US pipeline? They dont want it either. They have their own oil sands in Utah. The Alberta oil sands was just bad business. Money was made, but it was horribly managed.
7031 2018-12-08 23:18:50 Worship yourself and your society.

Morals, and the good parts of all religions naturally follow, leaving you with a critical thinking mind still able to say no when a snake oil salesman, telling you to hate a particular kind of person, is at your doorstep.
7032 2018-12-08 23:18:48 When your free oil changes run out <
7033 2018-12-08 23:18:47 It really only affects about 20% of the actual market. The small to medium sized producer. However CNRL just cut $1 billion off their budget and said oil goes up we will start up again
7034 2018-12-08 23:18:36 The guy changing my oil kept hitting on me thank u next
7035 2018-12-08 23:18:35 The irony abounds since Montreal gets its liquid fuels via oil-by-rail (which is more dangerous than pipelines) or via Algerian/Saudi tankers that travel the St Lawrence (endangering beluga whales). Wonder what the Saudis spend those $ on? #canpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #transmountain
7036 2018-12-08 23:18:29 Trump chose RexT b/c of Putin-RexT was given Order of Friendship by Putin&Exxon had a $500B oil deal w/Kremlin until PresObama imposed sanctions-RexT was supposed to help lift those sanctions so deal could go through-That didn't happen so now the Putin-installed POTUS is mad
7037 2018-12-08 23:18:28 Thank God for jnr Olbas oil.
7038 2018-12-08 23:18:14 Cemplung oil dongg.  Btw,  lucuuu
7039 2018-12-08 23:17:59 This tea tree oil smell is strooooonggg 
7040 2018-12-08 23:17:48 I have watched too many episodes of The Great British Baking Show that I’m planning on baking 100 different Christmas cookies this year. 

@trevorsalopek & @Lexx_Paige  I hope you’re ready to eat them 

I won’t put oil in them this time.
7041 2018-12-08 23:17:34 He was selling rubber ducks and then bought a Russian state oil company. He must have been one hell of a salesman. I’m no fan City either.
7042 2018-12-08 23:17:29 Hilarious...  But the miata's were the twin groupies!
They were rode hard and put away low on oil!
7043 2018-12-08 23:17:25 Question:
Why does a Chinese company have to abide by US sanctions when China buys their oil from Iran? Boycott hurts China too. 

I am an American, but why does US get to decide where rest of world buys their energy? 

What am I missing? Am missing something. Makes ZERO SENSE.
7044 2018-12-08 23:17:20 Don't worry Benoite the UK and USA and possibly Germany will hopefully bomb France into oblivion very soon. Like they always do. But you aren't a Muslim oil producer so it might take a little longer.
7045 2018-12-08 23:17:17 Good grief. For the past 40 years your provincial Con governments have mismanaged your heritage fund, not diversified your economy and now you’re paying for it. Don’t blame Ottawa for this. You guys told Ottawa to get their hands off your oil 50 years ago, so they did.
7046 2018-12-08 23:17:14 Hey it takes a lot of traveling to sell Snake Oil.

らあさん、これからもDJ活動頑張ってください！
7050 2018-12-08 23:17:07 Lmao my favorite had a popular bbo oil that sold out on arrival.we saw evidence of people using it.different countries. Now come again ?
7051 2018-12-08 23:16:44 Any thoughts on using CBD oil for pain relief?
7052 2018-12-08 23:16:36 Will the eco-fluff vs Canadian oil debate ever get real without Canadians from coast to coast to coast seeing “OUT OF GAS” signs at the pumps. #talkischeap #cdnpoli
7053 2018-12-08 23:16:29 unless its Saudi oil
7054 2018-12-08 23:16:17 Except Q-Bec they are against oil but not against transfer payments. Cut them off immediately!!!!!!
7055 2018-12-08 23:16:07 I agree with everything you say here, Senator.  But we have to stop hiding behind the euphemism of "special interests".  Call them polluters, oil companies, power companies, mining companies, chemical companies, whatever.  But name them.
7056 2018-12-08 23:15:37 1) the story isn’t no oil, it’s that oil that was only supposed to last 1 day lasted 8 days.
2) no ones nitpicking. Saying that Santa Claus is a fictional character isn’t putting down anyone’s holiday haha
7057 2018-12-08 23:15:27 ...you are aware of the impacts of palm oil on orangutans, you guess? ..what kind of a response is that?.. I might suggest that anyone who is aware, & continues to defend the production of this stuff, requires a serious conscience realignment...
7058 2018-12-08 23:15:26 Use motor oil for a photo-esk visual
7059 2018-12-08 23:15:21 Had a female customer tell me she learned how to change oil before she learned how to do make up... my heart fucking melted
7060 2018-12-08 23:15:18 i think it’s called jason and the argan oil?? it smells like roses i’m in love.
7061 2018-12-08 23:15:16 The chick-fil-a in the colonies closed cause they ran out of oil? Guess I'm going to canes
7062 2018-12-08 23:15:15 Raw oil & gas are stock full of carcinogenic compounds like benezene. We knowore now than we did in the 50's & 60's. We will know even more about our current state in the future, I hope...
7063 2018-12-08 23:15:10 We are very far from developing means to survive without oil .  Winter ! Convince me.  We live nest to the second biggest producer of pollution...USA.
7064 2018-12-08 23:15:05 So, it's  all thon ENGLISH whisky and ENGLISH oil  that subsidizes Scotland?
7065 2018-12-08 23:14:53 Oh, I'm aware. Putin loves Rex and of course has common interests in the oil business. He also has interest in our Secretary of State being a person with no diplomacy experience or knowledge.
7066 2018-12-08 23:14:49 Fool: Emissions fell in the US due to conversion of power plants from oil and coal to natural gas because gas is cheaper, despite your administration’s policies. And we’re still on track meet our Paris Accord goals.
7067 2018-12-08 23:13:58 Oil? I thought the discussion was on electricity generation? You know of any oil fired stations?
7068 2018-12-08 23:13:58 Turkeys dont vote for Christmas
7069 2018-12-08 23:13:47 The question is: Why do these oil marketers wait until a time when prices fraudulently go up before they decide they want to add to the problems?
7070 2018-12-08 23:13:47 “The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, But war was in his heart; His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn swords.”
7071 2018-12-08 23:13:42 Wayyo, our people get problem shaaaaaaa
7072 2018-12-08 23:13:38 I do agree at some point oil will be obsolete. But today? The global economy runs on it.
7073 2018-12-08 23:13:37 I can’t believe Tampico Twitter on my ass about High Pulp. Leave me and my high quality OJ alone. Keep drinking that motor oil you used to 
7074 2018-12-08 23:13:34 And we do fund clean - lots of VC funds etc. However, these things take years and years to develop and meanwhile global oil demand grows (and we give up the price arbitrage to the US)
7075 2018-12-08 23:13:21 You are a religious moronic bastard and dangerous to the safety of all Australians politicians and religious freaks cause more wars than big business oil cartels mining cartels big business interest is at the moment running the government local state and especially federal (ICAC)
7076 2018-12-08 23:13:20 @this_vid
7077 2018-12-08 23:13:19 A guy on youtube just tested these and I'm suprised that a few of them didn't work for him. The motor oil being one. It absorbed right in.
7078 2018-12-08 23:13:11 For the first time since 1948, U.S. net oil imports will drop to zero next year before stabilizing at about 320,000 barrels a day, analysts say.
7079 2018-12-08 23:13:10 Everywhere oil oil
7080 2018-12-08 23:13:02 Dude I love you. I’m an oil and gas engineer and I will do everything for you.
7081 2018-12-08 23:12:55 Don’t let your lips get crusty this winter! It’s as easy as olive oil and sugar scrub.
7082 2018-12-08 23:12:26 @sahouraxo G'ay S., There is plenty of outrage about Macron, but 1 problem is, France gets cheap oil by selling mass-murder weapons. We are not hearing outrage on that from the Gilets Jaunes. Opposing apartheid, we found that street stunts that mocked the gov. were very effective
7083 2018-12-08 23:12:20 Not true.
Please reference your rollback of a majority of  EPA standards with regard to coal, oil, wildlife refuges, lost habitats plus your carbon footprint  flying to a golf course on Air Force One repeatedly.

7087 2018-12-08 23:11:46 I believe you mean the "OPA" (Oil Protection Agency).
7088 2018-12-08 23:11:43 I don't know, oil isn't that large a part of the economy. 10 or 11 % of gdp.
7089 2018-12-08 23:11:40 Being poisoned is not an accident,,, big oil wanted him quite
7090 2018-12-08 23:11:37 Real progressives plunder Libya for its oil
7091 2018-12-08 23:11:31 But I guess since ur using a device made from oil product to send this info u dont really care about the use of oil products in the first place because if u did then u would not be using products that use it or be drinking from that cup in ur profile pic also a by product of oil
7092 2018-12-08 23:11:24 The only barrier to achieving a fair market price for our resources is just pipeline space...not quality of reserves, technical capability or customer demand. The US and Asia want the oil (especially heavy oil) but we just can’t get it there
7093 2018-12-08 23:10:59 Woodville is in beautiful country, so would have 30-60 minute commute, depending on what part of county you live in. Unless you work from home. Oil & gas is south of us in Golden Triangle. Lufkin to the north. Colleges all around. Angelina College in Lufkin is great 2 year school
7094 2018-12-08 23:10:51 I am from Quebec ...and I just don't understand this fixation on "No Oil from the ground "...quebecers have ??¿¿¿¿
As far I am concerned,..they.use cars as much as anywhere else in Canada....and we have oil in Quebec???
7095 2018-12-08 23:10:40 Alberta pays plenty to dig up the oil, but refusing to pay royalties to ship it. That’s cutting your nose to spite your face. Good luck!
7096 2018-12-08 23:10:38 So by posting this article, you feel that it gives you an excuse to push your dirty pipeline through their forests? Dude, start reading about solar and wind energy. Oil is last centuries thing...
7097 2018-12-08 23:10:31 They are also blocking conventional oil. Certainly the bitumen is much more friendly then the coal they burn now. Also, you would be surprised at how many first nations support oil. In any case, separation and shipping all our oil through the US would be the option.
7098 2018-12-08 23:10:30 美少年は今日も可愛いなー！
7099 2018-12-08 23:10:30 So 50 years ago Alberta told Ottawa to keep its fingers out of Alberta oil. You said you would manage, you’d set up at heritage fund and look after yourselves. Its a provincial resource, you said, but apparently now it’s a national interest and Ottawa should bail you out.
7100 2018-12-08 23:10:23 Maybe?  Tax loss selling is an overused and overrated explanation for any price mvmts in Dec.  Can the resistance of oil shares to the sharp narrowing be just another indicator of how uncertain investors are and how volatile (ie illiquid) oil shares are now?

7104 2018-12-08 23:10:03 I got to admit that I've rarely heard such a piece of garbage.. Those kind of stand can only be created by certain zionist sponsored french thinkers, trying to transform an inflation due to US sanctions on the third oil producer of the planet (Iran)
7105 2018-12-08 23:10:02 Ok, tell me why they why they hate Alberta Oil.
7106 2018-12-08 23:09:50 Girl you can go to any smoke shop and get a CBD oil battery. They’re like $13. As for cartridges I’ll DM you.
7107 2018-12-08 23:09:48 Yes! Its very important to help kids see the A in #STEM... I like that you're talking polarity by mixing oil & h2o painting!
7108 2018-12-08 23:09:36 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
7109 2018-12-08 23:09:26 Yes I agree. Hearing is just audible sound. Listening is focused concentrating. I'll let you know how it goes.
7110 2018-12-08 23:09:19 that's so weird.  i made croutons too and put them on top with the olive oil and plant based cream.  it was so delicious!
7111 2018-12-08 23:08:56 The name is Mike Sean is my brother but anyway Keith it will never happen I guarantee it Alberta couldn't survive on it's own besides oil which will be obsolete in the future they purchase everything from the rest of the country bc can push a button and turn off their power
7112 2018-12-08 23:08:54 That is a stove, and I suspect someone was frying something, and to keep all that oil splatter off the back of the stove....Wa  La......clean stove.
7113 2018-12-08 23:08:50 lmao....nah at the very minimum she has to be feeding me meals worthy of a russian oil oligarch
7114 2018-12-08 23:08:39 Coconut oil and cannabis oil that’s venomous remedies
7115 2018-12-08 23:08:12 But there is social acceptability to dump millions of litre of raw sewage into the St. Lawrence. Also ok for them to accept billions in transfer payments from Alberta which are largely based on oil revenues. Bunch of hypocrites!

7121 2018-12-08 23:07:31 Pursuing the shorter-term targets is a very important resolution, and Shell should be appreciated for already committing 10% of executives' remuneration to the cause.

But then, how cost effective is this clean energy pursuit for the oil & gas industry?
7122 2018-12-08 23:07:21 Which changes what? The takeaway is: There's a ton of oil and gas there that's about to be developed, no?

7124 2018-12-08 23:06:47 was looking at extra virgin olive oils searching quickly last wk, the one chose was the cheapest: Great Value, B+, minimally processed. Reading tips elsewhere though: Dark glass (no), various regions not good (is various). Otherwise it is just plain pure olive oil which is why B+
7125 2018-12-08 23:06:29 Have you tried the CBD oil
7126 2018-12-08 23:06:27 Youll like it.  Been to two Oil Kings games.
7127 2018-12-08 23:06:12 dad(last post) he dropped each baby into a different tank full of crude oil. He buried his wife about 9 feet away from them in a sheet in the ground. it was just a really sick, strange murder by ..okay this is what Im calling his syndrome. The Scott Peterson syndrome

7130 2018-12-08 23:05:15 @IcelandFoods first order came this week, haven’t tried anything yet but your stance on palm oil was my reason I shopped here, what a great thing to do. Can’t wait to try the food, all looks nice and great service
7131 2018-12-08 23:05:07 because they use plastic made from oil and oil based product in their products? But at the same time calling for a stop to the industry that allows the to produce and us their products?
7132 2018-12-08 23:05:02 and no doubt blaming greedy oil producers for high costs.  Macron has to find who moved his cheese and another source of someone else's $$$ to stay in office.

7135 2018-12-08 23:04:48 Didn’t travel then ? Typical oil era fan. I got back from Bournemouth an hour ago.
7136 2018-12-08 23:04:11 Dying my hair again today. Back to Loriel's Colorista Green No. 5, for a few reasons:
A) While the Argan Oil dye was super gentle and healing after a bleach, the color didn't take near as much as I desired.
B) For $10 it comes with three pairs of gloves AND a brush.

Er, perhaps not.
7138 2018-12-08 23:03:45 yes! my friend makes a homemade one, but i am unsure of how he makes it. he even takes away the high and can have it just be the oil. i’m sure other people make it too.

nayutaさんとゆっくりお話できたかな？？　お疲れ様！
7142 2018-12-08 23:03:22 Waste water remains toxic after extracting oil in Alberta. Well regulated doesn’t reduce its negative impact. At 15$ a barrel it’s time to drop oil and go solar and and wind.
7143 2018-12-08 23:03:08 This is a valid point. I appreciate that input. Thank you.
7144 2018-12-08 23:03:06 One final, final thing. I top with toasted pine nuts and good olive oil. In the community I grew up in, people use pomegranate seeds as topping as well. It's supposed to be good luck? I'm too lazy for that shit so I guess that explains my luck.

7147 2018-12-08 23:02:56 Bro, without US backing SA would crumble within a generation. Oil isn't the commidity it used to be
7148 2018-12-08 23:02:47 low-key hot space slaps though not gonna lie
7149 2018-12-08 23:02:35 Wait till oil companies shut down in retaliation of the announced cuts
7150 2018-12-08 23:02:30 No we don’t need their money, we can buy oil from Canada since they’re the largest oil producers. Texas buys them from Canada at $40 a barrel.
7151 2018-12-08 23:02:26 Final score Bisons 3 - Oil Kings 2
7152 2018-12-08 23:02:18 Yeah and a lamp with no oil can’t stay lit for 8 days. Let’s not nitpick about Holiday traditions here shall we.
7153 2018-12-08 23:02:16 but transfer payments from oil sales is socially acceptable? no oil no $$$
7154 2018-12-08 23:01:59 Life is sticky like a oil spill
7155 2018-12-08 23:01:56 I need to check my oil but it’s too damn cold 
7156 2018-12-08 23:01:48 Bring on the oil slick goo
7157 2018-12-08 23:01:37 Agreed...but it still doesn’t justify selling oil to Asia.
7158 2018-12-08 23:01:36 No way

7163 2018-12-08 23:01:09 It'a linner time!

Having myself some pork cubed steaks, pan-fried in olive oil and sweet onions, served over buttery spinach rice! Good stuff!

Also I've been using sweet onions a lot! SO glad I learned how good they are!
7164 2018-12-08 23:01:07 Oh, the oil guys. I forgot. Insignificant football doesn’t last.
7165 2018-12-08 23:00:51 I disagree. Reagan was a traitor. He conspired with an enemy country to keep hostages so he could win an election. And W sent over 1 million people to their deaths because he wanted to control Middle East oil and hang onto power as a wartime president.
7166 2018-12-08 23:00:50 Abolish oil/gas companies, seize their wealth and imprison all officials for crimes against humanity and planet.
7167 2018-12-08 23:00:45 They’re really screwing up the atmosphere with all those poisonous oil, gas, and rubber tire fires. Go figure.

7172 2018-12-08 23:00:27 The bandwagon man. Sneak grease, hair growing oil, leeches for your blood.
7173 2018-12-08 23:00:22 みんな騙されてるわ。(深い頷き) oilもcoalも自然エネルギーやからね。風力とか地熱とかだけじゃないんですよ。(深い頷き)
7174 2018-12-08 23:00:17 Get the oil industry to stop waiting for Keystone-XL and build some refining capability in other provinces.
7175 2018-12-08 23:00:16 Energy east pipeline cancellation looking worse every day. It wouldn’t have run into obstacles from those countries. No guarantee China or US buys more oil from Canada.
7176 2018-12-08 23:00:06 nah, that shit is bad for frizzy and wavy hair. if i do straighten my hair i always use Maroccan oil to control it
7177 2018-12-08 22:59:55 Yes sir u were way ahead. Ur common sense approach and looking out for USA. We hear u sir. This was a stupid idea from beginning. I agree we need renewable energy for future. But, use what we know works now till we invent something we know works better. Coal, gas, wood, oil. USA
7178 2018-12-08 22:59:52 Look how defensive he got in the debate with Cruz regarding the $10/barrel proposed tax on oil. "Who, me? No, I would never vote for that!" 

Yeah, tell me again how "green" he is.
7179 2018-12-08 22:59:46 WHAT do you want?  Do you want the #cdnpoli to ignore the federal court ruling on TMX?  Do you want the feds to build a refinery?  How is the swinging price of oil the fault of the federal govt?  And WHY do you have to resort to name calling?  Seriously? #abpoli #ableg
7180 2018-12-08 22:59:27 That is nonsense. If not for the blatant interference by Ottawa, throwing enough regulatory hurdles in the way of Energy East, that pipeline would be complete by now and would be feeding east coast refineries which now import oil from Saudi Arabia, shipped over by tanker.
7181 2018-12-08 22:59:17 Went in for a simple oil and filter change. Nothing more.  Drive in at 12:15 pm.  Was able to finally drive out at 4:00 pm.  3 hours and 45 minutes for an oil change?. Service guy promised a discount for the wait. They charged me full price. Never going back

7186 2018-12-08 22:58:42 Franchement ils sont top aussi ! Et un petit plus chez Nyx aussi ce sont les « Lip oil » tu le mets pendant que tu te maquilles, tu l’enlèves ensuite, tu mets ton RAL tu as les lèvres toutes douces, les petites peaux disparaissent. Une merveille
7187 2018-12-08 22:58:37 I believe that we have a good record of safety loading oil into tankers over the years.
7188 2018-12-08 22:58:08 I was reading @business today. Bloomberg noted that @Shell has allocated "as much as 8 percent of spending, or $2 billion, to renewable energy projects. This is roughly four times what competitors BP & Total spend.  Shell isn't waiting for oil's decline, why is #ableg? #abpoli
7189 2018-12-08 22:58:08 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
7190 2018-12-08 22:58:06 Can Trump trade ES or oil? I wonder if he is doing both. Trump is not clean after the G 20 meeting announcement. Investigation is needed.
7191 2018-12-08 22:58:04 If you mix olive oil with butter you can cook at high temps with the butter or bake for a long time with it and it won't burn
7192 2018-12-08 22:58:01 You’re deflecting your defence of oil to be about something else. 
What do we plant into the ground when a tree is harvested? How is that the same with oil?
7193 2018-12-08 22:58:01 Have had them, you have to change the oil every so many years. Great watch
7194 2018-12-08 22:57:58 2015, Operators In Permian Basin Offered Price Per Barrel Discounts To Get Their Oil To Market...Nothing Has Changed.....
7195 2018-12-08 22:57:09 Argh! Why is it so difficult for you to comprehend? 
Let me break it down, when Buhari came into power, he stopped the payment of subsidy. 
But then, oil marketers notified him of an outstanding debt left unpaid by previous admin which is now automatically his responsibility.
7196 2018-12-08 22:57:07 Does it burn? They told me to buy some saline solution , what’s the oil gone do ?
7197 2018-12-08 22:57:06 Thank you! I’ve been trying to find some jojoba oil I’ve heard good things about it I hope it works 
7198 2018-12-08 22:57:02 I've found digital art really really tricky. I always miss the feel of the paper! It looks like you're succeeding in digital art though! The oil panda dude looks cool!
7199 2018-12-08 22:56:59 Exactly the point. When Nigerians and Malaysians pull all the money out their countries and launder it through NYC and London, it’s small potatoes. Glasnost brought too much oil money. A condo salesman was the perfect Manchurian Candidate.
7200 2018-12-08 22:56:45 OPEC is cutting OIL Production so prices rise - what happened I thought Saudi Arabia was our close ALLI and your buddy TRUMP

7203 2018-12-08 22:56:04 Dear @realDonaldTrump increasing prices of oil is not the center of Paris Protest!! Why only poor people pay for that!! Carbon and Oil industries must be pay it the cost. Stop abuse about Paris Agreement! See USA problems
7204 2018-12-08 22:55:59 CBD oil has been very effective against anxiety and insomnia for both sister and me.
7205 2018-12-08 22:55:57 To all City fans going on about us not winning the PL, can’t argue with that but look at the PL tables pre 2011 and oil money, we get blamed for going on about history, but that defines who you are, history proves we have been there or there abouts for over 30 years not 7 #LFC

7212 2018-12-08 22:55:12 I will take my cities compressed natural gas buses to work, no need for diesel buses anymore. And i didnt realize the tar sands oil was exclusively used for at home products, like you allude to. I read the new tmx was for china to refine and use.Good luck with a dying industry AB
7213 2018-12-08 22:55:06 jojoba or coconut oil is what i use
7214 2018-12-08 22:55:04 pretty awful takeaway fish and chips from @lurefishkitchen, fish not fresh,soggy batter, very thick and drenched in oil. Cardboard French fries...disappointed.
7215 2018-12-08 22:55:03 Actually, Quebec made it clear it is opposed to oil.
7216 2018-12-08 22:54:55 Therein lies your problem Jason your tunnel vision won't let you see anything but Oil pipelines, same problem there was with 44 yrs of PC governments. nothing changes with you bird brains.
7217 2018-12-08 22:54:50 This is scary as hell. Not for the oil market, for the implications.
7218 2018-12-08 22:54:36 So do I!

End of the day this is all a dice roll. There are people on both sides selling snake oil. It is not going to be a bed of roses. Some people will lose their jobs. But change creates opportunity, and so with massive change massive opportunity. Be the solution.
7219 2018-12-08 22:54:30 Someone will use that same oil to fry akara for consumers at the nearest junction to that accident spot.
7220 2018-12-08 22:54:28 I love olive oil with garlics inside
7221 2018-12-08 22:54:02 You need some snake oil for your ignorance.
7222 2018-12-08 22:54:01 Thats good but Listening is one thing but hearing is another
7223 2018-12-08 22:53:58 Lol fake Luna and failed oil you say tomorrow if they call yall heifers bitter you will be angry, kontinu. I do wish ceec all the best with this nunu but yall heifers funny asf. Where were you when your teammates were mocking bamLuna, oh no that's okay right smh
7224 2018-12-08 22:53:54 Meanwhile you're revoking clean water regulations, tearing down environmental centers that protect critical pollinators, installing leaking oil lines to pollute our earth and supporting dusty coal mines that kill the workers, slowly but surely.
7225 2018-12-08 22:53:46 Simple solution just burn more oil.
7226 2018-12-08 22:53:31 @YaOnlyLivvOnce The cannabis oil have good properties
7227 2018-12-08 22:53:28 We are selling to Iran as well, but it doesn't fall in the sanctions category. 2) If it might have, there are negotiation channels open, like both India & China used for oil waiver. Huawei could have used that and would have provided details required by US law.

7231 2018-12-08 22:52:59 Not selling oil to Asia through the Trans Mountain, that’s for sure. Our taxes pay for all those things already.

7234 2018-12-08 22:52:47 Because right-wing ideology demands complete denial that burning oil and coal are the primary causes of climate damage—Science-be-damned! This is a complete blind spot for otherwise rational people.
7235 2018-12-08 22:52:44 honey, LOL he dumped them in the oil tanks. ignoring me. Never heard anything about that Until while he was being interrogated he asked for his father, not lawyer father. His dad was able to get the story behind it & later what he did with the wife & babies. Jesus it was horrible
7236 2018-12-08 22:52:09 Abolish oil/gas companies, seize their wealth and imprison all officials for crimes against humanity and planet.
7237 2018-12-08 22:51:55 I remember friends having 18% mortgages.  We were lucky with 12%. They worked in the Oil and Gas industry like we did. They lost their house. We kept ours. Today we have investments making hardly anything. Wish I had those interest rates now for my investments.
7238 2018-12-08 22:51:46 Warm saltwater (non iodized), pure Tea tree oil diluted with water.
7239 2018-12-08 22:51:30 Right, so when KM decided to give up on TMX, who stepped in? The federal government. With luck, it will steer the project past the objections of the Federal Court of Appeal. And, by the way, oil is up in price and the differential has shrunk to a normal $15.
7240 2018-12-08 22:51:28 Jill never hung out with Putin? A murderer and a major climate destroyer? You’re okay with that, but not some vote Beto made on a piece of oil legislation? Straw man indeed.

7245 2018-12-08 22:51:00 Bruce, too bad Trump wont be around when most of the world is rioting for drinkable water and adequate food due to climate collapse. You can't eat coal or drink oil. They'll be cursing him then.
7246 2018-12-08 22:50:42 Today and yesterday been great. But weh di oil deh fr fr
7247 2018-12-08 22:50:42 Because you in Calgary see it as risk and we see it as oil tankers going in and out of our City from this day onward.
7248 2018-12-08 22:50:29 2012 to like 2015 are all relatively affordable. Find you a good mechanic and you’ll be ok. My 06 model lasted a long time talking about 200k plus miles just kept the oil change on it.
7249 2018-12-08 22:50:20 I respect and hold the veterans of this country in highest esteem. But for some reason. I can't understand what Vietnam was truly all about. Oil? Diamonds? Democracy? Opium? REMEMBER our country ran out of Vietnam quicker than we invaded. What purpose was it?
7250 2018-12-08 22:50:14 they? earlier in on dateline they said they checked his GPS location the night before to the morning. He said he went to some tanks from the company that hold crude oil, never said why he was there & then after went home. I told my Husband half asleep slapping his feet honey,
7251 2018-12-08 22:50:14 What in the works are you babbling about ? So now you are against free trade . The oil we import comes from Iran ,nothing to do with USA ,
7252 2018-12-08 22:49:58 Every time I get an oil change they act like my act like my car about to blow up selling me extra stuff

7255 2018-12-08 22:49:24 Got a jar of the one with 'no palm oil'. Was just a jar of oil with a few peanuts thrown in. I'll stick to the cheap crap. 
7256 2018-12-08 22:49:17 Solar and wind energy can be stored but regardless, are u suggesting the alternative is …..? oil? Can you want to defend that oil is a long-term fuel solution
7257 2018-12-08 22:49:15 No Tim your right. Find solutions to the trade deals with China. Learn about the Oil Cartels, before you dismiss Saudi Arabia.

7264 2018-12-08 22:48:56 Yeah I thought essential oil diffusers were bullshit, but have you ever fallen asleep to the smell of peppermint?
7265 2018-12-08 22:48:39 Tell Who? Who ask you what? Please don't just push me to the wall you will not like me .... let the so call oil treat pimples  first before u put it to people's faces that this or that has failed ....nonsense I'm not part of that it front  and back nonsense stay off my line
7266 2018-12-08 22:48:39 Its the job of the federal government to get Canadian products to world market, where they can get world market value, not sell it for pennies because they have no way to get it anywhere besides the US. Canadian oil isnt at $15 a barrel because of a global supply glut. Thats fact
7267 2018-12-08 22:48:36 Arguments and facts Wolfgang not feelings 
Fact is that populations are moving to mega cities and cities are tired of ICE polluting the streets . In Paris you can’t even ride a bike for risk of carbon dioxide poisoning ..the age of oil for mobility is winding down .
7268 2018-12-08 22:48:29 omg what like since a little before oil
7269 2018-12-08 22:48:28 Church or religion has nothing to do with the mess we find ourselves. We just fail to understand that we need to reform / restructure our Constitution for the betterment of this nation. Just like G.O of Rccg said, you need a fresh oil when the old one isn't functioning.
7270 2018-12-08 22:48:28 The cannabis oil have good properties
7271 2018-12-08 22:48:24 クリオタさん、ありがとうございました。
私のDJもけっこう好みが似てるみたいで、高まっていただきありがとうございました！　ライブでふらっときてDJも楽しんでほしいという私の狙い通りいきましたねｗ　お疲れ様でしたー。
7272 2018-12-08 22:48:24 Russian money beats oil money
7273 2018-12-08 22:48:16 Putting lavender oil on your pillow apparently works a treat 
7274 2018-12-08 22:48:13 Do we really think someone “dumb” and “lazy” rose to lead one of the world’s largest oil companies, as Trump suggests? 
7275 2018-12-08 22:47:56 ew no it’s just sokor and oil 
7276 2018-12-08 22:47:54 Perfectly true, but that doesn't make it right. You speak as if it should. It doesn't even make it understandable, because there is never reason nor excuse for abuse.
7277 2018-12-08 22:47:42 I don't want to burst your bubble but the Bush's were also great friends of Saudi royalty.
They were all oil men.
7278 2018-12-08 22:47:37 I hear that to build solar panels requires lots of old fashioned oil to make the plastics.  That said, solar panels have their uses and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
7279 2018-12-08 22:47:34 Doesn’t Quebec want to go through New Brunswick with there power to reach the eastern United States? No oil no power plain and simple
7280 2018-12-08 22:47:25 Why should be it Vancouver to say? It’s not like you just started drilling oil and gas today! Surely every pipeline compass doesn’t point to Westridge.
7281 2018-12-08 22:47:19 Does it matter what kind of tea tree oil? I’ve been using one that’s like an essential oil.
7282 2018-12-08 22:47:05 Before you say facts, please check out the Oil Cartel.
7283 2018-12-08 22:47:02 How about Argentina? No oil, no the sad stories?
7284 2018-12-08 22:46:51 Windmills and oil field trucks! It’s horrible
7285 2018-12-08 22:46:46 ما بيقدر يغير ما بحيات كان قوي لمن ترك عناصر الجيش وهرب هذا مش خرج يسوق السفينة فينا لان راح يغرقنا معو
7286 2018-12-08 22:46:43 We bang on our neighbors’ wall when we’re unhappy with them, but what is a good way to communicate when we are happy with them? Maybe point my essential oil diffuser toward the vent? How do I know what scent they would like?
7287 2018-12-08 22:46:42 Uh can I purchase some ray olive oil haha
7288 2018-12-08 22:46:41 My dumbass put olive oil on someone’s açaí bowl 
7289 2018-12-08 22:46:39 @TenilleDashwood The cannabis oil is good for your psoriasis Tenille
7290 2018-12-08 22:46:37 Tax oil companies and limit state investments in fossil fuel, invest them in infrastructure jobs instead. 
And education so citizens have enough knowledge to choose leaders who make sense.
7291 2018-12-08 22:46:34 ハイ、小ネタ。
Here we goみたいなcore系を最後に持ってきてっていう私のリクエストでした（ぱにきさん→み～やさんの流れに持っていくために）。そしたら完成版でLet's Jump!も１曲目にあって、提出時点でわらってしまいましたねｗ
7292 2018-12-08 22:46:33 He is so owned by big oil and defense contractors. Read Solar Enchantment Now at Amazon Books. Outline a plan to solve global warming. $29.99 Uncle Trump (my relative) is going to go ape when he finds out. Martin Nix
7293 2018-12-08 22:46:29 I can’t wait until the future where my robot dog kills me for not putting oil in it’s Christmas stocking.
7294 2018-12-08 22:46:29 Did my first topside oil change on the S4 today. Extremely convenient and clean. I'm still not 100% sold vs draining from the plug as far as getting all the junk out but it's definitely nice to have the option.
7295 2018-12-08 22:46:27 Then this is the time to rapidly shift from oil and gas to renewables. Cancel LNG expansion and Site C.
7296 2018-12-08 22:46:25 Do you even know what the Oil Cartel is?
7297 2018-12-08 22:46:24 J-NERATIONの生歌も普通じゃ聴けれないしそれに加えワンマン曲、過去作で個人的に大好きな曲、緋色月下…なんですかこれ最強すぎるでしょう……(戦慄)
セトリがヤバいツイートも見ましたがこれは予想を遥かに上回ってました、本当に最高でした!素敵なイベントに感謝!!
7298 2018-12-08 22:46:18 Are they palm oil free as well?
7299 2018-12-08 22:46:08 What’s sad is the USA is not only ignoring climate change because of Big Oil but they are “blocking and denouncing” the migration of people’s negatively impacted from our denial.

#embarrassing
#whatwouldjesusdo
7300 2018-12-08 22:45:58 So nobody in this thread understands how transfer/equalization payments work? Notley didnt say a word about income tax, EI or GST. Shes talking about oil & gas contributions to federal equalization, and shes not wrong. Alberta feeds the rest of Canada’s equalization. Thats fact
7301 2018-12-08 22:45:51 Alhamdulillah for all the blessings, you're the most exalted ya Allah.
7302 2018-12-08 22:45:48 Ill collect it and a drop of oil aswell for doubting 
7303 2018-12-08 22:45:46 Blend 4 tsps catfish with 9 tsps babaganoosh. Add Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve on bread
7304 2018-12-08 22:45:35 We hurtin out here, oil n gas life kicked us in the a$$
7305 2018-12-08 22:45:25 this tattoo oil got my whole body feeling silky asf
7306 2018-12-08 22:45:20 S/o to the mechanics changing my oil rn. They’re being super patient and sweet :’) they can probably tell I know nothing about my car
7307 2018-12-08 22:45:18 Notice how they're framing the situation. 

The implication is that Trump will pull out the big guns, or in this analogy, pour boiling oil on his enemies. This frames declass of Dems biggest crimes as a kind of desperate, extreme act.
7308 2018-12-08 22:45:09 Read Solar Enchantment Now, at Amazon Books. Outline a plan to put the oil industry out of business, along with their hate. Martin Nix
7309 2018-12-08 22:45:06 got in my car to go get food and now i’m getting my oil changed because i almost forgot about it.
7310 2018-12-08 22:45:04 “Please do not break window. The AC is on he has plenty of oil and he’s listening to Mr. Roboto.”
7311 2018-12-08 22:44:46 هذه الصورة قديمة جداً انا عارضها ع حسابي في الفيس منذ سنوات
7312 2018-12-08 22:44:34 "The whitest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even fondled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
7313 2018-12-08 22:44:34 Yeah, they taste great. Plus, they recently removed palm oil. So they are at least better for the environment too, which is a big plus.
7314 2018-12-08 22:44:32 Lalakuku lala ... 
Mole Ba e LA bi lolipop
7315 2018-12-08 22:44:17 @MercedesBenzUK so yet another oil leak on my 2014 C63 AMG.... Second one in 12 months, only this one is not covered by warranty?! Getting fed up of this car now....
7316 2018-12-08 22:43:46 Our power come from wind ,hydro ,natural gas and coal .My home will be solar 80 % by 2019. Batteries can recycled .No fumes , oil changes needed or gas leaks .Longer brake life . My bubble is looking towards the future and it’s full of hope and actions to help it happen
7317 2018-12-08 22:43:26 Look...coal is out....Texas continues to close coal powered plants....oil is still needed; not doubting that....but renewables continues to grow
7318 2018-12-08 22:43:15 Lindsey the purchasing manager eats to bottle of oil and humiliate it
7319 2018-12-08 22:43:09 The minister Gives lawyers and politicians a worse reputation with every crafty deceptive earnestly delivered word.  I wouldn’t buy a used car from this oleaginous snake oil salesman
7320 2018-12-08 22:43:08 No, but how's that all worked out for the world anyway?  We don't need their oil or their faux stability.  They are just money launderers for hedge fund managers & oligarchs.  Oil is just an old crypto-currency.  It's not about foreign policy - or peace.  It never was.
7321 2018-12-08 22:42:46 Any hairdresser gyal tear out mi edges haffi buy me the hair growth pills and castor oil fi grow it back 
7322 2018-12-08 22:42:42 Put me with the negative group. There is no need to be greedy, stop expanding the oil sands and we will have enough capacity. Save the climate.
7323 2018-12-08 22:42:37 however you can't take an original money making resource and completely stop using it. Where is the clean power system to run Canada? Don't have it yet we are working on POLICY. We'll shut off the oil /gas tomorrow but you people better have something that can heat...
7324 2018-12-08 22:42:37 I believe they call that the 7 Year Itch which was finally scratched (with increasingly fine grades of sandpaper) and then soothed with several coats of Danish oil. Some Cherry trim and dog holes still to come...
7325 2018-12-08 22:42:29 たかまささん、来てくれてありがとうございます。
遠征する価値の高いイベントだったのではとｗ
お疲れ様でした！
7326 2018-12-08 22:42:10 Wouldn’t it be great to hear the reality we should hear: “Radio Scotland reports the massive investment into renewables from the Scottish oil & gas industry has pushed our renewables beyond expectations. Google & Apple are struggling to compete with the inventiveness of Scots ...
7327 2018-12-08 22:42:07 some of my professors, oil & chemical industrials turned academics: 
me: p fucked how u personally posioned the earth huh
7328 2018-12-08 22:42:06 Someone guy is talking to my dad about putting olive oil in his sons ear for an earache  it’s not 1910 anymore...
7329 2018-12-08 22:41:46 I wouldn’t know. 15 years of smoking cigs mixed with tabbacco flavored oil with plans to vape next year in an attempt to quit, I don’t see preference to fruit for taste. I’m addicted to what I do. Is it easier to quit if the oil tastes better? Genuine inquiry.
7330 2018-12-08 22:41:39 Feel like tannin 3 bottles of cbd oil hashtag fuck ma ovaries
7331 2018-12-08 22:41:38 Because I like public healthcare, a reliable electrical system, law and order, well funded schools for my children, good transportation infrastructure etc. What do you think pays for it all? Oil and gas is a significant part of that equation.
7332 2018-12-08 22:41:37 They are not hyping the failed oil againthey gave up on it
7333 2018-12-08 22:41:28 No...now instead of fear mongering you’re telling fairy tales. There is no real revenue from shipping oil to Asia because that activity won’t have started until the pipeline is twinned. All those things you think it will pay for are already being paid for.
7334 2018-12-08 22:41:27 Beautiful... it’s like the oil from the leaking derricks could catch fire and light up the sky.
7335 2018-12-08 22:41:25 tried almond oil on my hair for the first time earlier this week. verrry impressed
7336 2018-12-08 22:41:25 Doc that's my brother's .
Na borrow pose
7337 2018-12-08 22:41:24 Another: mix grated Parmesan with a large dollop of  lemon juice, which sort of dissolves/melts it. Add olive oil salt and pepper. Use as a sauce for spaghetti or another long pasta
7338 2018-12-08 22:41:17 We have a big shopping list.  Mustard, olive oil, wine, giant tins of ravioli but if we crash out I will fill my garage with wine and be so pissed for 6 months I don't notice anything.  I have a cunning plan.
7339 2018-12-08 22:41:12 cannabis oil
7340 2018-12-08 22:40:53 Jonah Goldberg has been questioning global warming since the 90s.  Whose interests align with doing that?  Koch Industries, for sure, as well as the oil and gas industry, and even coal.
7341 2018-12-08 22:40:52 LSJAJSJA the bread and oil dressing not so healthy, but lots of veggies which is good haha. I literally got like a 12” So there goes most of my days calories in about 15 minutes 
7342 2018-12-08 22:40:30 ざんねんです、、
7343 2018-12-08 22:40:23 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
7344 2018-12-08 22:40:21 Actually Putin chose Tillerson hoping Trump would come through on his promise to lift the sanctions on Russian Banks & Businesses so Rex could get Exxon moving forward with the $500 billion oil deal he gave him that award for.
7345 2018-12-08 22:40:21 Ai you already have a big version of Mercedes the twin sister of BMW . Allah ya sa alkhairi
7346 2018-12-08 22:40:21 Serious thoughtful question from a film critic: do you perform your own oil changes? Lift the car up, swap it out, and boom! Done.
7347 2018-12-08 22:40:18 Sen. Hirono, what about pledge by all Senate Democrats not to take ANY $$$ from any oil & gas companies & their suppliers, lobbyists, or executives? Do you think #SenSchumer would support that? BTW, I wish YOU could run for President! You'd be amazing! #Aloha
7348 2018-12-08 22:40:15 Might I also suggest, if you have to give a bottle of something, how about olive oil instead of wine?
7349 2018-12-08 22:40:14 I need to start getting back into oil painting
7350 2018-12-08 22:40:05 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
7351 2018-12-08 22:40:01 It's a sad state of affairs when a Living Legend such as Master Fabio is insulted publicly by a grifter. A man that has dedicated his life mastering his craft, & done so w/ honor & integrity, & one of only a handful of living RedBelts, is spoken down to by a snake oil salesman.
7352 2018-12-08 22:40:00 If you think oil is bad for the environment, just wait until you stop fuming and start researching and find out just exactly what’s being done to your food.
7353 2018-12-08 22:39:57 That’s what happens when you neglect the beard oil.
7354 2018-12-08 22:39:49 Oil on canvas
7355 2018-12-08 22:39:35 Try eucalyptus and Epsom salt boots. Friend of mine swears by it...she soaks feet in Epsom salts then mixes the eucalyptus oil with base oil and massages it on feet then wraps in cling film!  
7356 2018-12-08 22:39:30 It’s s good thing you’re lumping a catastrophic even like a dam breaking and the risks downstream to an oil spill.
7357 2018-12-08 22:39:29 They’re grabbing his arms for the same reason a guy grabs an ass. They find that part of the body sexy. Just because it’s a different spot doesn’t make it okay.
7358 2018-12-08 22:39:16 But market pass each other ooo,quality they diff, One modern woman go buy all of una black saop nd black oil ooo nd as for glo....why are you in a haste ,you no say we be talk nd do for this team so just chill,we don't carry fake fliers nd fake afrima #bbnaija
7359 2018-12-08 22:39:06 Is the oil coming out of Alberta's ground?
7360 2018-12-08 22:38:52 You to much baba oil everywhere ready to get stained lyrically
7361 2018-12-08 22:38:52 shintaroさん、たくさんからんでくれてうれしかったよー！
nayutaさんのセトリが到達の極みすぎて、もうnayutaさん大好きーってなりましたね！！ DJタイムもじっくりきいてくれてありがとね！！
7362 2018-12-08 22:38:41 In the near future the transfer payments will be heading to Alberta, so albertans are paying their share now, as they will be a receiver later, once the oil industry goes the way of the dodo. Unless AB starts to diversify their economy now.
7363 2018-12-08 22:38:40 Absolutely. Here the specific problem is basically the french are polluting less, so less money to the budget, so Macron raises the oil tax to balance it. It's a trap, and here, left and right rurals came to fight because they can't breathe
7364 2018-12-08 22:38:39 Saved lived? Malhotra cites the Lyon heart study in his questionable editorial as being very successful. Main intervention? Replaced butter with a canola oil based margarine.
7365 2018-12-08 22:38:22 God is a God of order!!! We need to obey the law!!! Your listening to "fake news" some ppl purposely used children as a pond or Girard guard - not cool! Romans 13! ( how Christian is that if you) Isn't that how judas talked toJesus when Mary used expensive oil for jesus , John 12
7366 2018-12-08 22:38:13 Sai ka wullo min wannan Farar
7367 2018-12-08 22:37:53 They’re not changing! They’re compounding! Adding a new risk doesn’t take away from any of the risks that are already there.

You still haven’t provided any good reasons for us to start selling large quantities of oil to Asia.
7368 2018-12-08 22:37:51 WTF IS THIS ON MY TIMELINE!! 
KEEP the EU deforestation criteria and stop the unethical Palm Oil plantations that are killing off the most biodiverse & beautiful tropical rainforests on the planet. “Farmers” should FIRST preserve the natural environment and wildlife living in it
7369 2018-12-08 22:37:45 Even at $1 per coin, that digital snake oil is “dear”.
7370 2018-12-08 22:37:44 Right beside you, however you will not fix Climate Change in the next year. YOU will get more joba and investments once you realize that Canada is still reliant on oil/gas. Once you higher ups start putting your ideas inti effect then we can get behind you...
7371 2018-12-08 22:37:43 Swap ko sa oil
7372 2018-12-08 22:37:39 That and the need to hire all those administrators to enforce wokeness
7373 2018-12-08 22:37:03 There's an oil for that too lol
7374 2018-12-08 22:37:02 I second these home remedies. Neti pot to relieve sinus pressure and Vick’s vapor rub under nose, bottom of feet, and on chest with two T-shirts on. Peppermint oil is also good for clearing nasal passages. Hot tea w/ lemon and honey is always nice.
7375 2018-12-08 22:36:57 I know, I`m kidding. butter is of no use in a hot country. (olive oil is healthier anyway)
7376 2018-12-08 22:36:50 Lemon oil
7377 2018-12-08 22:36:37 ي عمري وربي انا أكثر 
7378 2018-12-08 22:36:29 help so i went to wendy’s and i was wiping the oil off of my face with this oil wipe and the cashier was just watching me wipe my face 
7379 2018-12-08 22:36:28 Democracy. Take a look as racism today.  Five decades later racism, the fight  remains. The only difference is  the Middle East is willing to shed blood. To the blood must respond with blood. It'll never win. Our troops are in the area for two reasons 1) Oil and 2) Humanity...
7380 2018-12-08 22:36:27 If you look at the comments,  you can see I was taken to task because I was tactless in how I stated my point. The province of Alberta has major unemployment rising from oil patch cutbacks, largely caused by BC pipeline protests.
7381 2018-12-08 22:36:26 Ask the black fan right their what he heard. Let’s not all jump to conclusions. What I see is home fans shouting abuse at opposing super star player not racial abuse I might add. Every1 ground I’ve gone to home fans shout at throw In& Corners at away players to affect their games
7382 2018-12-08 22:36:26 Doctor a jefeni da KO karamarta ne, nifa ban matsa Ba sosai, ma tayassara 
7383 2018-12-08 22:36:25 Fat chance for pipeline with Quebec and Ottawa in lockstep - ok to ship foreign oil on St. Lawrence - no risk there.  Hopeless! Useless! Alberta needs a new government in Edmonton and Ottawa
7384 2018-12-08 22:36:21 Went in for my free oil change, but since I still had 500 miles before I was at 6000 miles I couldn’t get it for free, but I need it done before we drive 2,000 round trip back to Illinois so guess who had to pay $50 for a damn oil change that was supposed to be free 
7385 2018-12-08 22:36:17 Lavender essential oil protects against oxidative stress http://2018-11-27-lavender-essential-oil-protects-against-oxidative-stress.html
7386 2018-12-08 22:36:17 Exactly WHAT LOOKs like Nonsense
7387 2018-12-08 22:36:14 Or... OR.... Use something besides oil.
7388 2018-12-08 22:36:10 I know Christmas is a time to be festive and decorate everything in lights, but if my car could chill on the oil and check engine lights that keep flashing that would be great. 
Sincerely, 
I’m too broke to fix you
7389 2018-12-08 22:36:06 No rig. oil cart.
7390 2018-12-08 22:36:00 She is right. Oil and water.
7391 2018-12-08 22:35:59 I bet there is an essential oil for that
7392 2018-12-08 22:35:56 Unfortunately due to our need for foreign oil (which hopefully will be better soon w/new reserve in TX &NM), we will be tied to the ME.

I absolutely don’t agree w/ playing nice w/ Iran.

SA is better of “2 evils”. IMO.
7393 2018-12-08 22:35:53 Building the Trans Mountain extension for the purpose of increasing production so oil can also be loaded into oil tankers and sailed around to the other side of the planet, for the sake of the world burning more fossil fuels and escalating climate change makes even less sense.
7394 2018-12-08 22:35:53 One thing that made me really happy today was I found out they have e46 M3 oil change kits for cheaper than I used to get the mustang oil changed. I’m super excited to immerse myself in my passion
7395 2018-12-08 22:35:48 On Dat Oil..
7396 2018-12-08 22:35:43 Probably put too much oil. It looks like it was dunked in the bath tub.
7397 2018-12-08 22:35:36 Norway are also very rich thanks to their stranglehold on the world Christmas tree market apparently.....sure as hell cant be the oil or they'd be subsidy junkies like Scotland!
7398 2018-12-08 22:35:18 30$ oil changes HMU
7399 2018-12-08 22:35:18 Black Seed Oil, the gift that keeps on giving!
7400 2018-12-08 22:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this December? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
7401 2018-12-08 22:35:03 through the Norway sovereign wealth fund (from oil revenues) they own 1.3% of globally traded shares

Pretty much means you'll be boycotting everything to avoid enhancing Norways wealth

Good luck.
7402 2018-12-08 22:35:03 Watch how if they should experience an outbreak as a result of that oil, they'll turn around and call Buhari/ambode names for not visiting them or showing concern.
7403 2018-12-08 22:34:49 The council of Canadians is a leftist group founded in the 1980's and publish rubbish . Canada imports 1 billion barrels of oil per year mainly into Quebec and Ontario ,we export 3.1 barrels a year .Canada has the 3rd proven reserves on the globe .
7404 2018-12-08 22:34:47 I thought a long time ago that the oil companies were perfectly situated to start selling hydrogen for cars.  A good idea that just didn't happen.
7405 2018-12-08 22:34:36 I don’t want to drill for oil on protected lands.
7406 2018-12-08 22:34:34 i bought a tea tree oil leave on face mask and the lady at the body shop said it's safe for sensitive skin but im convinced it might be causing me to break out
7407 2018-12-08 22:34:33 We love our bread with olive oil
7408 2018-12-08 22:34:33 Boil your kettle get a bowl of water and drop some olbas oil in the water. It’ll help you sleep and breathe!
7409 2018-12-08 22:34:29 For the first time in 75 years, America has stopped our dependence on foreign oil. Outstanding! Thank you, President @realDonaldTrump!
7410 2018-12-08 22:34:25 You should visit Weld County, Colorado, which aligns strongly pro-fossil because of fracking's temporary reprieve from peak oil, while the (Brighton?) @Vestas wind turbine plant has been hiring far more recently
7411 2018-12-08 22:34:21 Tell us again what you did to help move Alberta oil when you were a federal cabinet minister. Oh yeah, absolutely nothing. You are a whiney bellyacher and nothing more. Please go away!
7412 2018-12-08 22:34:16 6Uncaさん、ご満足いただけたようで！
ロックバラードって切なくて、いいよねー！！　またnayutaさんにロック系も歌ってほしいですね！！　ロックからトランス（緋色月下)の流れも神すぎて（語彙力
7413 2018-12-08 22:34:13 A soak in a hot bath with some Neals yard seaweed and arnica bath oil might help..
7414 2018-12-08 22:34:05 I can across seal remains on fetler shetlands. They smelt. There was a very distinct oil smell almost like old diesel buses. The fish might be a sunfish.
7415 2018-12-08 22:34:02 The Oil vs Gas derby #motd
7416 2018-12-08 22:33:52 The oil no even exist again

Pls hype #CEGAR

7417 2018-12-08 22:33:24 Anti-Frizz:

⤷ 1 Tablespoon of almond oil. 
⤷ 1 Avocado. 
⤷ 1 egg.

⤷ Mix all the ingredients until a homogeneous mixture is obtained. 
⤷ Apply to dry hair and wrap it in a plastic. 
⤷ Leave on for 30 minutes. 
⤷ Wash with cold water.
7418 2018-12-08 22:32:56 I'm not voting for someone in the pocket of oil executives or a cop, so in that scenario I'll probably vote Stein. 

Now that you know that me, and others like me are likely to do that, I hope you'll campaign for someone we will vote for in the primary.
7419 2018-12-08 22:32:53 You’re deflecting your defence on oil tankers to opioids. If you have any constructive ideas about opioids, I’m all ears. If you think something remotely related to the oil situation can help with the opioid crisis, I’m listening.
7420 2018-12-08 22:32:53 They ought to stay home then and use their campaign contributions to pay off debt or something. I can't see oil drillers helping get him voted.
7421 2018-12-08 22:32:45 عسى ربي يوسع عليك دنيا واخره على هالكلام الطيب البعض من الناس يقول ليش نسقط القروض احنا ما علينا قروض
7422 2018-12-08 22:32:45 Had to use a tonne of oil to avoid sticking, eggs were like OMNOMNOM soaked it all up.
7423 2018-12-08 22:32:42 Who is going to replace their oil with Energy innovation if you also said USA is going to ruins too.  Looks like Zimbabwe will be the last one standing 
7424 2018-12-08 22:32:37 #WhenTrumpOpensHisMouth America becomes the largest crude oil producer!!!!
7425 2018-12-08 22:32:24 5 hours later, I’m leaving the car dealership for my scheduled oil change.
7426 2018-12-08 22:32:21 What a win 
7427 2018-12-08 22:32:12 You do know @JustinTrudeau is a pathological liar right? That he’s happy BC emissions are up because it drives tax revenue to buy more voters for his base right? That he’s enabling despotic dictators to reap the oil benefit for a UN seat vote, right?
7428 2018-12-08 22:31:52 As oil fail na,they decided to hype #CEGAR  bless up 

#BBNaija
7429 2018-12-08 22:31:44 Thank you! Looks like a bit of a minefield, but I'll do my best. 
Not happy about mince pies. Last year I was concerned about the content of animal fat, not palm oil.
7430 2018-12-08 22:31:42 relying on oil will give us that nightmare ... it is a limited resource

transitioning to a clean green energy frees America of the oil sheiks and coal barons
7431 2018-12-08 22:31:42 ありがと！
ひおきさんならずっと「いいねー」って言ってるイベントですよコレ。応援ありがとね！セトリあげたからみてね。

7433 2018-12-08 22:31:29 Got a bit of time on your hands this weekend? Why not listen to #theMonthlyhour podcast and share it with your friends. This month we go to Exmouth Gulf with writer Tim Winton to talk about saving this precious environment from oil and gas.
7434 2018-12-08 22:31:24 I say Welcome my Glory.
I move from miracles to signs&wonders
Fresh oil is on me.
12 extra baskets of signs and wonders I receive.
I am an Excellency.
My glory is now.
GLORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7435 2018-12-08 22:31:21 And that’s what it is! What is the difference in unrefined and refined coconut oil?
7436 2018-12-08 22:31:14 When the oil is fresh it can be very potent and aggressive.
- Pastor E. A. Adeboye
7437 2018-12-08 22:31:13 You don't pour oil on a dirty body. Nobody uses moisturizer on a dirty body.
- Pastor E. A. Adeboye
7438 2018-12-08 22:31:11 I live on the coast... I oil it regularly but it's a losing battle...
7439 2018-12-08 22:31:09 Fresh oil can be very very aggressive.
- Pastor E. A. Adeboye
7440 2018-12-08 22:31:09 You two should get out more often.
7441 2018-12-08 22:31:00 I also bought rose hip oil bc I heard it's really good for your skin idk
7442 2018-12-08 22:30:56 When the old oil is no longer effective then you need the #Freshoil 
- Pastor E. A. Adeboye
7443 2018-12-08 22:30:53 The consumer pays for electricity. The consumer pays to get from point A to B. How those two happen, the consumer doesn't care. They are not responsible for it. Companies are though. They make the conscious decision to do that with coal, oil and gas. It's on THEM.
7444 2018-12-08 22:30:33 If he signs the trash they sent am sure you'll not excuse him, you'll be at the fore front of calling him lifeless, pls bro not every time we become so partisan let us be objective for once.
There r a lot of contravening sections they hv to harmonize.
Same ppl removed card reader
7445 2018-12-08 22:30:05 Tip of the Day:  Fats ARE essential and will keep you satisfied.  Use an olive oil mayo on your sandwich or try dipping veggies in hummus or guacamole.
7446 2018-12-08 22:30:03 あるぴんさん、ありがとうございます。

7448 2018-12-08 22:29:46 Visiting home is always so great. Coconut oil moisturizing cream? Korean face masks? Nose strips? This shit mine now thanks mom
7449 2018-12-08 22:29:46 It’s not an attack. You’re comparing oil to opioids.
7450 2018-12-08 22:29:42 عادي ترا تطلع للكل نحاف والا سمان شيء طبيعي موجود بالكل المهم مافي حل يخليها تروح بس اذا تبينها تخف استخدمي Bio oil
7451 2018-12-08 22:29:21 Sheyyyyyy,failed oil 
#BBNaija
7452 2018-12-08 22:29:15 There's a lot of oil drilling activity around that area.  Not sure how this would relate though.
7453 2018-12-08 22:29:15 I mean you could’ve had a good argument going but then you threw in the “30 year age expectancy” thing which doesn’t actually make any sense.

That had nothing to do with oil, or the way farms functioned, or any of that. It was 100% the fact doctors didn’t know anything.
7454 2018-12-08 22:29:12 Just laughed so hard after singing along to the philipo Bertie olive oil advert that I think I might faint 
7455 2018-12-08 22:29:08 Clean it with some apple cider vinegar and water and then put some tea tree oil on it
7456 2018-12-08 22:29:05 Well that says it all...so I’m a Hooligan well I guess I’m a very well paid one then. Clearly you are anti football #Sad #Football #Passion  #Racism #KickItOut
7457 2018-12-08 22:28:59 Will oil drillers be voting for Trump again?
7458 2018-12-08 22:28:54 Same thing he did with Alberta oil just kept me moving the goalposts back further and further until companies said enough.
7459 2018-12-08 22:28:49 Considering Saudi and UAE sold crude oil to the US who then refined it to produce fuels, it was a windfall for both regimes, every single day. But hey, they were killing uncooperative Muslims for us. 
7460 2018-12-08 22:28:38 My maternal grandpa hit the bad karma version of that. Hit oil & gas on the farm. Got cash & all the free gas he could use to heat the house & barns. 'Course he, my grandma & all the kids still living at home have had cancer problems, most died young. The older kids 0 cancer...
7461 2018-12-08 22:28:35 So the fact he benefited from oil at any point in time renders him not a good Democrat? People change. He divested personal assets and didn’t accept any corp or lobbyist money in his 2018 campaign. That’s positive action.
7462 2018-12-08 22:28:32 it works both ways ...as the oil has enriched the peoples & government of Saudi Arabia too....
7463 2018-12-08 22:28:31 Coconut oil used for frying smells disgusting.
7464 2018-12-08 22:28:21 Parents asked what I wanted for Christmas and I said an oil change
7465 2018-12-08 22:28:18 Snake oil salesman.
7466 2018-12-08 22:28:04 Painmentfailed oil business
7467 2018-12-08 22:27:56 Can Scotland have the Norway option? Especially the bit about the oil?
7468 2018-12-08 22:27:54 You fail to understand that the a lot of the “local” opposition to this project is about what’s proposed for us “locally” here. Big Oil’s only solution has been to load oil tankers out of Westridge and have large tank farms in Burnaby.
7469 2018-12-08 22:27:38 No No ! Griddle pan virtually no oil ! Will give you recipe . One I found yrs ago however disected then reinvented !
7470 2018-12-08 22:27:20 If an oil change is $59. How much more should it be for synthetic oil? At #MerlinFord in Saskatoon, it’s $100 (ADDITIONAL!) (Feel free to share) @MerlinYXE
7471 2018-12-08 22:27:19 Who use... oil based products and oil in their every day life.
7472 2018-12-08 22:27:10 釜飯さん、ありがとうございます。
初対面だったかな？？ニアミスは何度かあったかと思いますが。満足いただけたみたいでなによりです。思わぬ飛び道具が飛んでくるイベント、それがどりーまでございます。ほんとにみんな笑顔でうれしくなっちゃった！！！
7473 2018-12-08 22:27:06 im also convinced tea tree oil is not okay for sensitive skin and that is what's causing my skin to break out but isn't tea tree oil used to prevent blemishes idk anymore
7474 2018-12-08 22:27:01 West Texas and southeast New Mexico reeks of oil and money in the air
7475 2018-12-08 22:27:01 That is a valid point except Putin probably called the shot on that pick to free up sanctions on the Exxon oil deal.
7476 2018-12-08 22:26:58 As an Albertan, I think Canada needs to use its own oil 1st. I'm all for transitioning away from fossil fuels but to shut down prarie oil and welcome foreign oil is perplexing
7477 2018-12-08 22:26:58 "Pardon of Manafort widely seen as a likely breaking pt for many Rs," Costa, who sells himself as an expert on Congressional GOP, reported on Twitter today.

In other news, "Lucy expected to let Charlie Brown kick the football at practice this Sunday."

7481 2018-12-08 22:26:45 You ain't lying ! But I had to find a healthy alternative to the oil lol !
7482 2018-12-08 22:26:43 1. There are legal guidelines AMCOM. Ben, his creditors & amcon must have reached an agreement.
2. Kindly share any sustainability report on @Trader_Moni.
3. I will share reasons Y it’s not a smart decision for a government that continue to borrow amidst dwindling price of oil.
7483 2018-12-08 22:26:42 Mmmm ya document it like how ? How the oil industry has to only allow so much emissions. 
Its next to impossible to tell where the minerals come from.
Unless tested which cost 1000's of dollars per test.
But meh they are "trying" 
I'm just tired of people bashing on oil who use..
7484 2018-12-08 22:26:41 they have a trademarked move where they catch a football but it's actually an IED and they die in front of thousands because american oil execs wanted a stake in the middle east
7485 2018-12-08 22:26:33 Lol, I live in Ontario, and Ford being the lying, corporate cretin that he is is trying to take this through the courts. 

But again, since the current bill reading is revenue neutral for consumers, this still looks like oil industry bitching.
7486 2018-12-08 22:26:07 It’s coconut oil day & it always freaks my mom out because I walk around the house with a shower cap on my head 
7487 2018-12-08 22:26:06 So Emir put peppermint oil on the toilet seat
7488 2018-12-08 22:25:51 OPEC trying to put it to the consumer again buy cutting oil production it’s time we put it to those Swamy bastards 
7489 2018-12-08 22:25:39 おぱよぉおおおおお
7490 2018-12-08 22:25:34 Child, vinegar and oil have nothing on some of those couples.... stinky vagina Danielle and Mohammed were the best...miss them
7491 2018-12-08 22:25:30 CBD Oil!!!
7492 2018-12-08 22:25:21 And it’s not about oil prices it’s because their President wants to put a 67% tax on fuel making gas prices approx. $7.00+ which falls on the middle class. MSM is lying to you.
7493 2018-12-08 22:25:15 Again your attack is very weak. There is nothing wrong with shipping oil to China or anywhere else that will provide us with the maximum benefit.
7494 2018-12-08 22:25:10 My ex best friend whom I wish I was still bf with used to put coconut oil on her face every night and she didnt have acne afterwards I don’t understand how
7495 2018-12-08 22:25:05 Still looking for info on the problem ENVIRONMENTALLY with palm oil!
7496 2018-12-08 22:24:55 Nawaz and Zardari ruled for the past 40 years and left behind their legacy aka mafias. Liberals, mom batti, Media, journalist, lawyers, real estate, oil, security and exchange and more importantly the zakootas. 

Lot of work and effort needed to get rid of them.
7497 2018-12-08 22:24:51 What are you 12 or a libertarian? Lol. Yes, it is simply supply and demand that leads oil companies to hide climate change for decades, or to collude with every other oil supplier in OPEC to control oil prices for political reasons. Read a book my guy
7498 2018-12-08 22:24:47 yasuさん、ありがとうございました。
いろいろ詰め込みすぎて、ここまでいろいろ準備して、いろいろなジャンルを詰め込んで開催する人はいないと思います。楽曲情報も頭おかしいレベルで頑張ったのでｗ　第１回で相当満足してしまったのですが、次回あるとすれば私がまた夢をみたくなったときですねｗ

7500 2018-12-08 22:24:21 I was there. I saw those ppl die....that war was about oil and money. We been knew that....that’s why I don’t watch cnn or any other news.

7502 2018-12-08 22:24:18 Be it oil or lumber (which B.C. exports plenty of to China but no one seems to bat an eye about that) be sold for the highest price as that maximizes the revenues generated for all.

7506 2018-12-08 22:23:47 The Guardian Feb 2014 Fracking is depleting water supplies in America's driest areas, report shows. From Texas to California, drilling for oil and gas is using billions of gallons of water in the country's most drought-prone areas. Suzanne Goldenberg, US environment correspondent
7507 2018-12-08 22:23:41 Yes it does, but the real oil holder are militaries and wars.  US is independent now....

7512 2018-12-08 22:23:09 Here is my soup recipe:
1) Warm spices in oil on sauté setting. 
2) Dump in bag of frozen mixed veggies and 3/4 cup instant rice. 
3) Add 5 cups good chicken or veggie stock. 
4) cook on manual 4 minutes. 
5) splash of wine if I have some, maybe some fresh herbs. 
Done.
7513 2018-12-08 22:22:49 We could sell them all the LNG, oil they need and would not be captive to Russia. If only Trudeau has not cancelled #EnergyEast.
7514 2018-12-08 22:22:36 Too much stress on my hair to become a fugitive. It would need more than once weekly hot oil treatments. 

Hard to do that while on the run...
7515 2018-12-08 22:22:36 Correct. It's a strategic asset, like our National oil and helium reserves.
7516 2018-12-08 22:22:30 Oil jobs are well-deserved & earned, and have created a benefit this whole country has prospered from for decades! Only a privileged & out of touch minister would continue to toe the party line and kiss Trudeau’s ass rather than stand up for the province he’s from and it’s people
7517 2018-12-08 22:22:28 I actually think consuming less of everything, especially beef, dairy and junk food that contains palm oil is a better way to go than gas tax. Also think moving away from combustible engines is a better way than gas tax. Subsidize electric cars. Improve infrastructure to support.
7518 2018-12-08 22:22:26 This is super useful and a great site especially for those who want to train the intricacies of not only karate but all martial arts. Thanks for the post!
7519 2018-12-08 22:22:13 in 2016 he took $11k from pro-gun groups and $150k from gun control groups. not exactly equivalent to half a million from oil and gas
7520 2018-12-08 22:22:10 Yes, and that is its biggest problem.
7521 2018-12-08 22:22:08 Thank you! I smoke regularly but never tried cbd oil. What is it like? I’m feeling a lot better luckily! I’m starting to feel like myself Thank you!
7522 2018-12-08 22:22:05 So it's ok to benefit from oil as long as you stop it?
7523 2018-12-08 22:22:02 i just think theyre miserable to work with they dry So Fast compared to oil
7524 2018-12-08 22:22:00 I fancy Mr Spencer's MA in Religious Studies and further studies and authorship rather outranks Kamm's PPE and Grub St background  - that's snake oil territory

Anyway who trusts #fakenews #lugenpresse anymore with their continual "Emmanual Goldstein" hit  pieces on the hero TR?
7525 2018-12-08 22:21:57 Going to try Sunday Riley clarifying face oil
7526 2018-12-08 22:21:48 Right? Before they get an actual makeup remover or a real moisturiser... coconut oil left me with some of the ice pick scares I have now cuz the breaks outs were terrible 
7527 2018-12-08 22:21:45 Sounds like you’ve run out of good reasons to ship oil by oil tanker through Metro Vancouver to Asia now and you’re resorting to your own brand of confederation style fear mongering.
7528 2018-12-08 22:21:44 It is abuse and hate filled, that much is glaringly obvious. As such it is despicable behaviour, racial or not.
7529 2018-12-08 22:21:34 Atleast you don't deny that we affect climate. That's the main issue. We need much more science on how badly polluted we'd be if we just dropped all of our regulations at once. Angers me that we've retrograded to more coal and oil when we could be leading a new market-alternate
7530 2018-12-08 22:21:29 I’m In Oregon. We honestly have more dispensaries than 7-11’s. Cbd is a miracle life-assistant. . The oil works for so many things and our nabe’s dog is on it for his anxiety. Anxiety is bullshit. I’ve had it on and off for a decade. Cbd over Xanax any day.
7531 2018-12-08 22:21:28 Some car survival necessities hopefully (jumper cables, water bottle for radiator, oil rags), extra jackets or shirts, aaaand maybe some left overs from sex-capades like bras, thongs, or boxers 
7532 2018-12-08 22:21:27 Operators of fossil power plants and the oil industry should be much more forced to grow CO2-consuming trees for CO2 reduction. For 1,000 kg of CO2, 1000 new trees should be planted each year.
7533 2018-12-08 22:21:23 2 pieces of bread, an egg, a frying pan and a bit of oil.  Don’t forget to switch the heat on 
7534 2018-12-08 22:21:21 I worked for a few weeks in a school lunch room? Did you know they pour straight Wesson oil into the vegetables to season them? I was astounded about how much oil they used. My kid want eat them says they are to oily.
7535 2018-12-08 22:21:10 And when BP's rig explosion spewed oil across America's gulf coast, CNN called in expert scientists to shout at us, "This ecosystem won't recover for a century." A year later there was almost no evidence of the spill. If you keep crying wolf and get it wrong you lose credibility.
7536 2018-12-08 22:20:59 Lol. Yea.  We also used to “abuse” horses by riding around on them.  Whale oil was phased out when petroleum and veg oil became commercialized.  That didn’t happen overnight.  I’m all for new tech but oil will be needed to get new tech launched.
7537 2018-12-08 22:20:40 They want him as long as they can bc he signs anything that big corporations, big oil/fossil fuel and  the rich that gives them more money and less restrictions ....that’s it..money.
7538 2018-12-08 22:20:31 Yes, it is. Stop using Tillerson as a crutch. When he got hired, you people were calling him a Kremlin puppet and decrying his leadership for "big oil". Maybe you should also realize that taking advice (which Trump did) from SoS is a good idea. Nothing illegal was done.
7539 2018-12-08 22:20:29 No it isn't new and it is definitely the down side of football and is despicable behaviour. No wonder the fans are well known as hooligans!
7540 2018-12-08 22:20:29 sooner or later the anti vaxxers are gonna have to call up the essential oils people to see if they have an oil to cure polio
7541 2018-12-08 22:20:22 Lmfao it won’t work just put it in some oil
7542 2018-12-08 22:20:21 Could somone whos currently using or has used cbd oil kindly tell me if it’s helps with anxiety. I actually can’t be arsed with googling and reading through articles
7543 2018-12-08 22:20:18 I believe we were reaping the benefits of equalization payments when our government was rolling in the dough with high oil prices. We blew that cash as  well
7544 2018-12-08 22:20:13 I needed an oil change like..yesterday.

7547 2018-12-08 22:19:56 It must be an amazing feeling knowing how much you are helojng people, not only woth the oil, but also with food and money to people who really need it! I would love to be part of your team!

7550 2018-12-08 22:19:43 But this isn’t about my modern life at all is it?

It’s about shipping oil to China for their use.

7552 2018-12-08 22:19:23 You and I are like oil and water!
7553 2018-12-08 22:18:57 wait until the real rules kick in and america finds it has to cut back on oil/coal/SUV's/BBQ's/MEAT/PLASTICS/ETC 

then the republicians are really going to f-ing blow their top

7555 2018-12-08 22:18:48 I feel like a lot of people have a dickensian idea of poverty where if you own material stuff, aren’t replacing cooking oil with water because you can’t afford oil then you’re not poor when in reality a lot of people who live above the poverty line suffer from wealth disparity

なんだかんだ私のイベント、DJ来てくれるのはじめてでしたよね？うれしいな！　イベント中わいわい盛り上がってたみたいでそっちのほうもいいなーってみてました（お酒弱いから出番前に飲めない）
7557 2018-12-08 22:18:39 I believe in GOD & his son Jesus. There is a grace for us.The oil of our people (virgin olive oil) in a small container of your choice. Put the oil in and ask GOD to bless it.Then place oil on the head or forehead and ask God to bless if it be his will.
7558 2018-12-08 22:18:33 I don't care if a man touches my arms. It's the ass grabbing that's a problem.
7559 2018-12-08 22:18:26 Oil companies ?
7560 2018-12-08 22:18:17 Interesting work.  When you use a ketogenic diet are you (1) eliminating carbohydrates or (2) adding a supplement like MCT oil to get to ketosis.
7561 2018-12-08 22:18:17 Do you spray oil on your vittles? We just worked some jalapeño poppers with a bit of peanut oil conservatively applied.
7562 2018-12-08 22:18:12 If the real risk with transporting vast quantities of oil through a densely populated community prompted @MarcGarneau and Transport Canada to reroute the train away from going through Lac- Mégantic, that says a lot about the risk potential for Metro Vancouver.

7566 2018-12-08 22:18:05 Scheer is for but is aligning his policy platform with Legault's to get Statist/Socialist Quebec vote & Legault's against pipelines AND called Western Oil 'Dirty Energy' ... so LibCon Scheer is either confused or disingenuous... the autocrat's not bound' to his policies anyway

7572 2018-12-08 22:17:22 I had to take Ian’s truck to work today so he went and completely filled it up with gas and changed the oil, connected my phone to the Bluetooth, and even started it so it would be warm before I left :’) I really love this dude y’all 
7573 2018-12-08 22:17:20 3. Bitcoin as investment or SOV during turbulent times in global economy or war conflict. hope not. One example is: Oil price futher decline could cause hyperinflatation for part of the world.

7576 2018-12-08 22:16:54 Difference between EU and US is also that after 2020 the EU only supports advanced biofuels and has mandated to reduce conventional biofuel to almost 0% by 2030. Palm oil was even banned right away.
7577 2018-12-08 22:16:53 People who say coconut oil is not good for skin /  hair need to understand that different things work magic for different ppl. Perhaps it aint good for YOUR hair and it clogs YOUR pores. Cut an aloe leaf and rub it on my skin and it turns to fish scales. Thats just MY experience

7581 2018-12-08 22:16:32 OH NO U Don't.  U are pushing misinformation Again! China reduced theirs, even though it is still bad. Many more countries reduced their emissions. U are making USA behind, when we have the best available, & u are pushing for coal, & oil sands. Which is stupid.
7582 2018-12-08 22:16:31 If we stay oil and coal powered we will look like china in 5 to 10 gens.. i dont want that even if im dead. What do you have against trying to simply not pollute... we are smart enough to turn the world over from fossil to alternative fuel/energy

7585 2018-12-08 22:16:20 Nice try, hemp oil or hemp seeds DO NOT have any trace of drug in it. Your desperation to vindicate organised retaliation and organised criminality from 2013 to present knows only too well how much you have all messed up.
7586 2018-12-08 22:16:19 I watch a lot of My Neighbour Charles when I get bored and it was so funny to me that one of the foreigners living in Korea made the exact same mistake I made while I was in japan which was buying a huge bottle of mirin thinking it was cooking oil. I feel less dumb now 
7587 2018-12-08 22:16:10 Not built for that at OIL 
7588 2018-12-08 22:16:10 Oil companies are supplying to meet demand. Demands that you make every time you buy and use such products. Live according to principles. You can’t complain about drug dealers while you’re buying drugs from them.
7589 2018-12-08 22:16:06 You know you're lying about this, right? For one, this IS no Canada-wide carbon tax implemented, it's revenue-neutral in some form in BC, and the majority of the proposed forms in Alberta/Quebec offer tax rebates here to low-income families... so stop pitching for oil companies?
7590 2018-12-08 22:15:57 I'm getting an oil change at the Indiana Wal-Mart and im so tempted to Uber (or walk but cold) to the casino fuck – bij Illinois/Indiana State Line

7594 2018-12-08 22:15:23 Laughter, dancing, music and almond oil on your face. In that order. Don’t get them mixed up  No dancing on your face. That’s just wrong.
7595 2018-12-08 22:15:20 You can’t brush your teeth without oil. Demand is still increasing year over year. Cute EV’s don’t change that in the near term.
7596 2018-12-08 22:15:18 People in Scotland know all about BBC bias. We've had that drummed into us for generations. "Scotland too wee too poor too stupid to govern ourselves" whilst WM plundering our oil gas and other resources. Sorry mate, we don't need Labour's 'help'.

7607 2018-12-08 22:14:49 I agree that they aren't the same, but they weren't influencers in 2018. He took in money from employees of telecoms, charter schools, real estate developers, banking, oil, and media, all of whom are under the Wall Street umbrella. His votes in the House reflect the donations.
7608 2018-12-08 22:14:49 Low oil prices tank the stock market, so I hope they restrict production and bring the price up. We have had enough of you causing carnage in the markets.
7609 2018-12-08 22:14:47 I’m the darkest brown naturally but for first be years I’ve had blonde and pink hair; hydration hydration hydration!! even if your scalp is oily, your hair especially the ends need oil to rehydrate. so hair masks and minimal heat damage to prevent more damage
7610 2018-12-08 22:14:47 Poor deranged wee person, thinks they'll be able to live in water when the sea is lapping through their house and eat coal and oil to survive, when there's not fish left ...  hope she knows how to live without breathing clean air.

7614 2018-12-08 22:14:22 Let's hope there isn't going to be scarcity this festive period. The populace is watching and hoping government do the right thing, this oil is ours!
7615 2018-12-08 22:14:18 I’m interested in packaging and palm oil, not offers. Rethink your strategy.
7616 2018-12-08 22:14:12 Ask the CFC black fan right their what he heard. Let’s not all jump to conclusions. What I see is home fans shouting abuse at opposing super star player not racial abuse I might add. Every1 ground I’ve gone to home fans shout at away players to affect their games throw&corners
7617 2018-12-08 22:14:03 When was the last time you got your oil changed? Old oil makes the starter work harder which means it draws more power.
7618 2018-12-08 22:14:00 A few idiots go on this tangent every time there is an oil slump. It’s absurd.
7619 2018-12-08 22:13:57 So because people die in car accidents, because people die from opioids, because planes fall out of the sky we should risk our City and the livelihood of everyone who depends on the sea at risk of a spill by selling more of the same cheap oil we are selling to US to China now?
7620 2018-12-08 22:13:33 we are building a pipeline to empty the oil sands faster  but we want a coal free day ?  silly
7621 2018-12-08 22:13:24 So I'm just trying to be the independent woman I was raised to be & check my oil the way my bf taught me but of course I can't unscrew my oil cap cuz it's so tight so I have to ask some random guy to help & he barely touches it & it comes off...

Thank God I loosened it for him
7622 2018-12-08 22:13:23 And yet, according to BHO, his admin is to credit for the good economy and oil recoveries.  Right, I'm buying it.

7629 2018-12-08 22:12:50 This list of the top three oil producing countries plus Kuwait suggests the motive. And it's sorta normal to have a 'crisis' at this point in the CoP process. SA threatening to hold the process hostage is curious considering its current PR issues...

In that man's face I see nothing but hatred, and whether that hate is directed against another race or another club it is just as evil.
7632 2018-12-08 22:12:37 I bet if you overlapped the price differential of wcs oil to wti it would seamlessly match decline in wage growth

7634 2018-12-08 22:12:32 My wife just pronounced to a group of people: “My husband Charlie fills up my life.” I felt honored and loved until I borrowed her car and discovered that she had no oil, no wiper fluid, no water in the radiator, and low tire pressure. #FillMeUp

7636 2018-12-08 22:12:26 Well except if it contains palm oil. That should be a rule. That seriously limits the choc you can find to eat...
7637 2018-12-08 22:12:24 If Sask wheat presented an environmental concern they probably would. Not a simple matter. The damage the bitumen oil does is horrendous. How much will Alberta pay to BC when there is a leak? (there will be) There is little benefit to BC and the First Nations and they know it.
7638 2018-12-08 22:12:14 I like woodier scents. And some flowers and spices. My beard oil has nutmeg and cinnamon oils as well as sandalwood. Its smells like cake

7646 2018-12-08 22:11:26 Oil & gas... I bet there are a dozen new fracked wells within a mile of me. KY used to be a very rich State waterwise. We still have more navigatable river miles than any but AK.

I don't know about a hot tub but I've got a new spa tub I can't wait to install & climb into...
7647 2018-12-08 22:11:07 Yes. We can benefit economically as well as environmentally. The Oil Industry and the Polluters have just been telling us lies for so long, time to stop listening to that crap.
7648 2018-12-08 22:11:06 How about you begin by forcing Tom Perez to reverse his decision allowing DINOs to take oil company money??
7649 2018-12-08 22:11:02 @EmoOilIreland Hi Emo Oil. I'd like to speak to your complaints department as I'm seriously unimpressed with your treatment of my grandfather. Thanks.

7651 2018-12-08 22:10:44 really? i thought palm oil was used in soap etc
7652 2018-12-08 22:10:39 Anything that causes that much hate is bad. What is the difference if hate is against another club or another Race? No difference whatever. Hate is passion uncontrolled and undirected.
7653 2018-12-08 22:10:38 We put a few drops of peppermint oil in a spray bottle. We spray the area around any entrances (we have a raised house). We spray anywhere where they might enter. Every Sunday.

Does anyone have any recipes/instructions to achieve those results?

7660 2018-12-08 22:10:03 Tillerson earned it because of the closeness Exxon has enjoyed throughout the years. It’s his Exxon ‘connection’ that made him SoS. It’s ALL about oil & always has been. Tillerson negotiated on behalf of Exxon (& inflating his Exxon golden parachute). He quit Exxon to join trumP

7662 2018-12-08 22:10:03 Just got some wax and oil in 
7663 2018-12-08 22:09:59 Do they have oil?
7664 2018-12-08 22:09:54 Many thanks for the kind comments Dean. Most people don't understand that oil is the economy. They think it's something separate & that economy runs on money. But money is just a call on energy & in our civilization today, that means oil. It's simple but takes time to absorb.
7665 2018-12-08 22:09:48 Made a new scrub out of coconut oil that @HunterrMcCoy would actually like, unlike the time I convinced him to use it to tan. #missyou

7667 2018-12-08 22:09:43 Therapy and natural supplementation go a long, long way (ex. CBD w trace THC, vitamin D, fish oil). Stay away from pharmaceuticals if you can, they tend to make things worse. Keep your head up and best of luck to you. Be strong for your family.
7668 2018-12-08 22:09:42 Have you ever donated?  When you do they ask you what field you work in. Half of Texas works in the oil and gas industry.
7669 2018-12-08 22:09:33 @BuyLegaIMeds As I said I would. I just placed an order for the CBD oil. I have tried many as a spinal cord injury from a MVA accident left me permanently and totally disabled. If it does half of what others have, Ill not stop recommending it. From what I lve read, Ill be busy.
7670 2018-12-08 22:09:30 no better way to shock my brain into activity than chili oil
7671 2018-12-08 22:09:21 No more palm oil please
7672 2018-12-08 22:09:08 This is why it bugs me when people say heavy oil is “lower quality”. It’s only lower quality (yield) if all you want is gasoline. But the product slate is so much bigger with heavy. Hence the refinery demand.
7673 2018-12-08 22:09:07 The hate in his eyes is enough, and the force with which he is making his feelings known.
7674 2018-12-08 22:09:03 Cold Lake oil can be drilled regularly & there’s a lot there , so  .  There are also cleaner extraction methods but not viable financially without more effective transport . It’s a dilemma .
Canada should use Canadian oil.
7675 2018-12-08 22:09:02 Oil spills are the real cost. Once the line is twinned to Westridge and oil tankers are loaded daily and continuously, we’ll be stuck with this activity for decades...with no way to stop increases or to prevent catastrophes.
7676 2018-12-08 22:08:55 Castor oil
7677 2018-12-08 22:08:51 But no correlation at all to his pro oil voting record
7678 2018-12-08 22:08:50 Getting a oil change , and this cute butch is serving me . Heyyy cutie
7679 2018-12-08 22:08:49 At this point I don't give a shit about Quebec and their premiere. He doesn't want Alberta oil to pass through his province then he can sit on it and spin. Illegal crossers can be his problem then.
7680 2018-12-08 22:08:32 Imagine pipelines supply the oil to these ships so they can travel thousands of miles to supply eastern Canada with Oil because of the Liberals
7681 2018-12-08 22:08:17 Definitely! But the infection was beyond control,..... we got there eventually! She would then put essential oil on my hairline to prevent getting re-infected. Or my hair up, hair in a scarf.... whatever it was!
7682 2018-12-08 22:08:09 "But there is social acceptability for Quebec taking Alberta Oil Dollars"
7683 2018-12-08 22:08:06 You are not standing for the oil workers who recently lost their jobs, but you are attempting to defend industries which are apt to collect government subsidies, while laying people off mercilessly. #bottomline #bigoil #moguls #TrumpNorth #abpoli #cdnpoli #pipedream #poisonisreal
7684 2018-12-08 22:08:04 Moderately successful preemptive attack against a larger, more industrialized nation in the hopes that they would sue for peace. Bold strategy. I guess tag teaming the oil rich Soviets took too much thinking.
7685 2018-12-08 22:07:58 Lol I thank God I don't have to. Just oil and brush my headtop and I'm good
7686 2018-12-08 22:07:54 Yes- for the first time in 30 years, America has more oil. Luckily we won’t start more wars about it
7687 2018-12-08 22:07:49 Uh oh. This calls for strong drink. Or oil of cloves. Whichever is to hand. Good luck getting a quick and permanent solution.
7688 2018-12-08 22:07:45 Get you some Jamaican castor oil. we can’t have you going out like that.

7691 2018-12-08 22:07:18 Your response to that meme shows you are as thin skinned As Trump himself. People with your ideologies have destroyed Nations throughout history yet here you are selling your snake oil and acting like you know what the hell you're talking about. Grow up kid.
7692 2018-12-08 22:07:12 Could I actually fall asleep in there? No. I really need complete darkness, around 66 degrees, and the sound of rolling waves for optimal sleeping conditions. Lavender oil doesnt hurt either.
That said, is it noticeably quieter than most large stadiums? Yes.
7693 2018-12-08 22:06:57 Blah blah blah and yet we still continue to import Saudi oil.
7694 2018-12-08 22:06:50 Really... from what footage did you hear this. Exactly Nonsense lots of obscenities none of which racially motivated. Black CFCfan right In the middle of it. Racism is disgusting I.e bananas at Arsenal players so let’s not take dilute home crowd big game passion for anything else
7695 2018-12-08 22:06:50 Do you recommend a specific brand of CBD oil? I’ve only used the kind for dogs. Actually given to a dog, not me. 
7696 2018-12-08 22:06:42 So instead he's ok with dumping millions of liters of raw sewage and importing oil from countries that condemn gays and oppress women. What a hypocrite.
7697 2018-12-08 22:06:28 How’s that Saudi Oil?
7698 2018-12-08 22:06:24 what about conditioner WITH argan oil  cause that’s what I use
7699 2018-12-08 22:06:19 Really?
He did nothing?
He bought you a damn pipeline that most people in the country opposed for billions and billions of dollars.
What did your party do when in power?  Pretended price of oil will be high forever?
How did that work out for us?

7701 2018-12-08 22:06:17 Well you could ship it by rail to the left coast, onto tankers, south around the tip of S A, up the east coast, and down through the seaway, because inbound oil tankers are O K !
7702 2018-12-08 22:06:06 It’s not about a pipeline, it’s about oil tankers and oil spills and the risks to our environment. If only the pro-pipeline side was even honest with telling Canadians that it’s about tankers and not just the benefit of their pipeline, that might be believeable
7703 2018-12-08 22:06:02 It’s official, January 7th is the date I go to Texas and work on the oil rigs.
7704 2018-12-08 22:06:01 Avengers 4: Got my oil leak handled

7706 2018-12-08 22:05:43 Is there palm oil in mince pies?
7707 2018-12-08 22:05:34 I understand what you're trying to say and I completely agree 

Quebec doesnt care for foreign oil they want to move their own agenda forward

The sewage dumps are a municipal issue that the provincial government has no power over about such is how federalism works unfortunately
7708 2018-12-08 22:05:21 I work for electricity generator....coal is not a valid source anymore....natural gas is the majority of the fuel source then oil, and followed by renewables (growing)....
7709 2018-12-08 22:05:21 How narrow mined are so called leaders. The oil crisis is not only about moving oil. It's the ripple effect. How many BUSINESSES are suffering. EI and WELFARE will not keep a business running. GET IT THROUGH YOU HEADS!

Oh but I love the smell of baby oil 
7714 2018-12-08 22:05:02 Of course you conveniently forget that Quebec has incredible hydro power capabilities.  They have been importing US oil in increasing quantities. Quebec might be the first province to ween it self of oil in the next 10/20 years. THINK about that instead of whining.
7715 2018-12-08 22:05:01 If you’re hitting your mark consistently, make your adjustments with your feet at set up (small adjustments, 1/2 board). Changing your mark changes the balls path through the oil too much. #Tips
7716 2018-12-08 22:04:50 Middle Eastern oil is socially filthy. All dino goop is horrible, but we aren't at electric flying jetsons cars yet so we need to keep burning goo. Tarsands so dirty it cost more to refine than its worth.
7717 2018-12-08 22:04:43 I love their rosehip oil and I’m trying this even tho it would’ve been smarter to start with 5% djdjdndnd
7718 2018-12-08 22:04:41 Modi's Govt is arrogant, spreads Goebellian false stories, parochial. The FM had 'gleefully' increased excise rate whenever oil rates dropped to deny people fair price, but increased it by ₹14.25 (approx). When people protested, it was reduced by ₹2.50/ litre. Diabolical.

7723 2018-12-08 22:04:04 What is missing is the undercurrent, big oil and defense contractors. Just published a book at Amazon Books, Solar Enchantment Now $29.99 Order It. I call for a declaration of war on Global Warming. I outline a plan to solve it via engineering. Martin Nix
7724 2018-12-08 22:03:57 tbh hate to admit it bas the progress at Spurs is amazing w without the oil money takeover which is rare. Spurs were able to force the rest of the league to acknowledge them as one of the best. Firm believer enno because of tottenham the old terminology of "top 4" became "top 6"
7725 2018-12-08 22:03:56 I need an oil change but leaving my house is such a hassle
7726 2018-12-08 22:03:52 Ben investing usd try formundan beri takipteyim. 5-6 sene öncelerden beri. xau, usd, oil bir çok grafiğiklerinde nokta atışı öngörülerini bilirim. Tolga abi gibi karşılıksız bu kadar emek ve bilgisini paylaşan, üstüne bu kadar mütavazi biri olan çok kişi yoktur.
7727 2018-12-08 22:03:34 No one wants to separate, but it is important to point out that 24k$ per family would come to us on separation. Maybe the least we could expect for staying in federation is that we can get our products to market. What if BC blocked Sask wheat like it blocks Alberta oil?
7728 2018-12-08 22:03:27 Coconut oil helped reduce mine from my first pregnancy a lot:) & with my second pregnancy I used it every day religiously and I didn't get very many :)
7729 2018-12-08 22:03:22 CBD oil will help. The highest strength possible. Give it a shot! I’d love to here you on a podcast. I really enjoy your post.
7730 2018-12-08 22:03:21 Got my oil changed & they washed my car too... It must’ve been super dirty bc I didn’t even recognize my car when I went out  I gotta do better lol

7732 2018-12-08 22:03:04 No sugar, no caffeine and no alcohol.  Some CBD Oil.

7736 2018-12-08 22:02:26 so one of the "arguments" for human vegetarian/vegan diets is that cow farts (methane?) are destroying the ozone layer

well, no, it's the oil companies, also, if that were true, if we stop eating meat, wouldn't there be MORE animals to fart?
7737 2018-12-08 22:02:24 Yeah, Bush being involved. The whole idea of extracting oil from Iran for a cheaper price.
7738 2018-12-08 22:02:22 From experience, Nespresso make it very easy to recycle. In-store or collection with your next order.  IMHO they're taking responsibility. More than can be said for loads of other manufacturers. e.g. palm oil products, mobile phones, disposable nappies, etc etc etc
7739 2018-12-08 22:02:00 -Apply castor oil to your eyebrows and eyelashes for hair growth. 
-Exfoliate your lips bed so you wake up with soft lips 
-Put on some which hazel or tea tree oil to your acne to reduce it over night. 
-Put drops of drying lotion to your pimples for it to be smaller or gone.

7742 2018-12-08 22:01:24 What  the actual fuck is wrong with you... too much of that oil you been drinking
7743 2018-12-08 22:01:06 Great, no more oil and gas shipments to Quebec, seems they don't need it, and should lower the price for the rest of us! See how long that lasts.

7749 2018-12-08 22:00:41 Her position, once back in opposition, will be very telling. If she sides with the NDP (and by association, the Leapers) she'll have no hope of re-election and will lose any credibility she may have had. If she continues to cheerlead for the oil industry, she'll be shunned by NDP
7750 2018-12-08 22:00:37 why would i work on my finals when i could spend hours applying coconut oil to my hair & then just sitting in bed instead? honestly the choice is so easy

7758 2018-12-08 21:59:44 Production of fossil fuels, manufacturing, transport, cattle farting, deforestation to produce palm oil & graze cattle are much bigger causes of GH emissions. Hence, corporate carbon tax. You don’t want poor people to carry the biggest burden here. That’s what a gas tax does.
7759 2018-12-08 21:59:43 Of course I completely, that’s why I said in my opinion. I’ve personally had better luck with products that contained coconut milk vs oil.
7760 2018-12-08 21:59:31 No. This is all the rhetoric that the pro oil lobbyists like yourself are using as your own brand of fear mongering.

7768 2018-12-08 21:58:56 Please stop doing this. You're peddling snake oil here and it's shameful.
7769 2018-12-08 21:58:55 The term was used 30 years ago when activists were going into the forests and setting traps for workers in the logging industry.  In the current context, it's used to discredit anyone who questions big oil.  It's appalling that .@CBCSask lets this go without question.
7770 2018-12-08 21:58:44 Arab development was paid for mostly by oil revenue. How did they get the oil revenue? Europeans & Americans discovered oil under their feet, built oil wells & developed the market for the oil. The Arabs didn't do anything except rake in the bucks, for nothing they earned.
7771 2018-12-08 21:58:41 And 200 years ago people use the whale oil for lamps and wood for steam engines. No technology is fixed. Those hanging on to oil are Luddites are surely as buggy enthusiasts when the cars showed up.
7772 2018-12-08 21:58:40 Rose Oil mud masks are imperative
7773 2018-12-08 21:58:39 The more you gnosis... Ask yourself why we find oil several miles below the oldest fossil records. Ask yourself why it's considered sustainable to mine for lithium but called pollution to mine for coal. Ask yourself why climatologists ignore the grand solar minimum. Psychopaths.
7774 2018-12-08 21:58:30 No one in Alberta would object if Quebec stopped using oil. I wonder why Quebec prefers oil from Saudi Arabia over oil from their own country
7775 2018-12-08 21:58:29 This is a good starting point! Let's begin by keeping the government from tipping the scales. I like a level playing field too.

We can start by eliminating subsidies for GHG-emitting-but-profitable corporations (e.g., oil/gas, agribusiness, fast food...). Would you support that?
7776 2018-12-08 21:58:19 No, it’s the same as what so many here also share...and that’s a reluctance to allow the pipeline to be twinned, for the purpose of selling oil to Asia at the risk of those living in Metro Vancouver and all those people and creatures depending on the sea for their livelihood.
7777 2018-12-08 21:58:15 Out of $800million owed the oil marketers .you're giving not even half of the sum but this. Interesting
7778 2018-12-08 21:58:14 Should NEVER complain. Praise the Oil moguls every day and twice On a Sunday

7780 2018-12-08 21:58:02 Oil companies stock prices are cratering, and no one want to invest. Even though bond price drop, it's hard to imagine they'd want to ramp productions (if CEOs are logical). We can count how companies announced Capex cut ....
7781 2018-12-08 21:58:02 Why doesn’t Alberta refine more oil, ship higher value-add product and create huge secondary plastics & related industries?
7782 2018-12-08 21:57:55 Bio oil is good also coconut oil (as in what you buy in a jar in health food shops.....Grape Tree is best not H&B)  but more importantly as a fairly recent follower and fellow "weight takes up headspace person...MASSIVE WELL DONE X
7783 2018-12-08 21:57:47 EI helps people that suffer temporary unemployment for many reasons, not just oil industry layoffs.  To say EI is a handout is plain insulting.
7784 2018-12-08 21:57:45 He knows. It's the ridiculous agreement non-binding to lower carbon emissions. Nice to see The French Leader put climate change- high gas prices over lowering oil prices for his people to afford gas, to y'know keep warm and drive.  Yeah that went well. Said no one ever.
7785 2018-12-08 21:57:39 Rather than simply casting ad hominem attacks, how about providing your views on what the federal government could concretely have done/should do to resolve Alberta's stranded oil assets?

7791 2018-12-08 21:57:07 1-2

Paris is burning because of energy taxes. Imagine if the SAUDIA cut its oil production, just imagine.Then the price of oil will be twice that because of the limited availability in the market

7792 2018-12-08 21:56:56 昨日は主催お疲れ様でした！！
めちゃくちゃ良いパーティーでした！！！
7793 2018-12-08 21:56:48 If you have an old tyme pump oil can with the flexible spout...I need it and I'll pay in cash.
7794 2018-12-08 21:56:44 I would like everyone to know that I will be making 80 latkes tonight and so far I have only gotten boiling latke oil in my eyes once. Thank you
7795 2018-12-08 21:56:38 Could you use an oil based lube?
7796 2018-12-08 21:56:30 Texas margaritas must be served in oil barrels then.
7797 2018-12-08 21:56:20 Does anyone have an oil heater or something I can borrow over the winter? It’s freezing in my living room!
7798 2018-12-08 21:56:15 My little brother is in the kitchen making eggs and he picks up the oil and he’s like “oh extra virgin? Just like me” 
7799 2018-12-08 21:56:01 However, there was great social acceptability for enriching Quebecers from ABs equalization payments thanks to our oil industry for decades.
7800 2018-12-08 21:55:59 I think it depends on hair texture, but I’m sure it would be better than coconut oil 
7801 2018-12-08 21:55:55 @jasoncundy05 Jason am I right or wrong Racism !! have a word on this ? #CFC #RealTalk #KickItOut
7802 2018-12-08 21:55:52 He needs some CBD oil to help that sleeping that he’s lacking
7803 2018-12-08 21:55:43 My argan oil came today we going  clear skin
7804 2018-12-08 21:55:28 Polar bears are actually quite upset, because #Rosatom is launching its first of a fleet of floating #nuclear power plants to power more coal, oil and gas extraction in the #Arctic... the Akademik #Lomonosov currently being tested in #Murmansk.
7805 2018-12-08 21:55:08 I'm making garlic infused olive oil, I hope it turns out. Garlic is life.

7810 2018-12-08 21:54:21 That is the most stupid thing you have said all day. 
Heaven forbid that the government, industry, and individuals be smart enough to learn (after how many boom/bust cycles), that we need to diversify, and not JUST depend on oil, and not JUST depend on the US market.
7811 2018-12-08 21:54:05 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
7812 2018-12-08 21:54:03 Prayer 2:

The first time Elijah threw his mantle on Elisha, Elisha knew he was to be great. 

He remained a servant until the fresh oil arrived.

7813 2018-12-08 21:54:02 Úntate baby oil y que todo te resbale
7814 2018-12-08 21:53:54 Anyway, the bottle seems to be an excellent olive oil and   @traderstewie has great taste in wine and food, so I trust his taste in oil also.
7815 2018-12-08 21:53:51 Olibos=boss of oil λέμε
7816 2018-12-08 21:53:51 There’s absolutely nothing related between the opioid crisis and shipping oil through Metro Vancouver. You clearly don’t understand the opioid crisis either.
7817 2018-12-08 21:53:36 The 100,000 lost employment was in Oil & Gas only.
7818 2018-12-08 21:53:27 @bingo2368 and @KeiranLee doing a 69 scene, baby oil the lot
7819 2018-12-08 21:53:18 Girl I use Cantu sometimes but mostly I don’t use nothing I just deep condition my hair and add some olive oil in it but I just let it be frfr
7820 2018-12-08 21:53:16 But JT supported Trans Mountain. It was put on hold by the Supreme Court. Alberta's stranded oil isn't his fault. Plenty of blame to go around, including federally, but Alberta and the oil patch aren't blameless as they expanded capacity ahead of pipeline approvals.
7821 2018-12-08 21:53:12 The US (Texas)land locked your oil by funding the opposition to the pipelines in BC. The fact is, Alberta and BC are better off together than apart. It’s not as if BC is lacking assets. Don’t forget that we were just as shocked as you when the NDP became our respective prov govs
7822 2018-12-08 21:53:09 Boss, if Nigeria starts to refine crude oil, will our sale of refined petroleum be included in our OPEC quota or that is meant for crude oil only?
7823 2018-12-08 21:53:07 If my brain was so big I would have finished one hour earlier. 

I was confused with positive and negative values. 

Had a hell of a day that is why I was burning the midnight oil. 

It started with my mother asking for her knickers!!!
7824 2018-12-08 21:53:03 En la confe de ensco comentaban que están viendo mejoras en jack-up y harsh environment. Si el oil cotiza en 60-70$ y las empresas de E&P empiezan a invertir, con la retirada de las plataformas inactivas y el M&A que hay en el sector, la cosa debería mejorar! Long $ENSCO
7825 2018-12-08 21:52:53 Fox News owner Rupert Mudoch and Dick Cheney are in on Golan Heights oil too!  Then Congressman (now FL governor) Ron DeSantis tried to make the US Government recognize Golan as sovereign territory of Israel.  They're all corrupt as hell!
7826 2018-12-08 21:52:51 Clearly, Maduro is trying to withdraw the USD for international trade. Two questions: how interchangeable would be the petro for USD in the market? How Venezuelan oil company would sell crude to their US branch CITGO without the use of USD?
7827 2018-12-08 21:52:47 Last night was cool because this dude and I found out we had the exact same skin care routine down to the mf Thayers Witch hazel rose water toner, face masks, and even THE SAME EXACT OIL
7828 2018-12-08 21:52:43 รออยู่สุวรรณภูมิเหมือนกัน 5555
7829 2018-12-08 21:52:42 China and India both are also importing oil from Iran after waiver from US. There's unwritten rule or respecting sanctions for global good. The sanctions are against nuke proliferation hence it's for common good. These sanctions were breached by #Huawei and financial transactions
7830 2018-12-08 21:52:37 基本、叫ぶので！
7831 2018-12-08 21:52:31 Saw petrol today at €1.43.
Heating oil on Friday was €700 for a thousand litres...
7832 2018-12-08 21:52:23 Metal Statue: (Oil!...Oil!)
7833 2018-12-08 21:52:16 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has any units near the oil field?
7834 2018-12-08 21:52:09 Then they get no oil! Quebec can pound salt! I want a referendum where the rest of Canada votes to keep em or not
7835 2018-12-08 21:51:59 Maybe Alberta should develop alternative energy businesses, secondary manufacturing and refining oil in Alberta. It’s easy to blame Trudeau and the Liberals.
7836 2018-12-08 21:51:48 Oil Panic looks like it doesnt kill anymore
7837 2018-12-08 21:51:45 It’s a global tax payed to the global elite they’ve used their oil profits to control the renewable energy market. This climate change co2 tax is a scam made to destroy our economies. They already have the technology just unwilling to share with us.
7838 2018-12-08 21:51:45 CBD oil bud.
7839 2018-12-08 21:51:25 Your precious coal & oil $ is killing us! Invest in the GREEN DEAL!!! More jobs!!!
7840 2018-12-08 21:51:22 You’re the one who just said “modern ULCC’s that are double hulled” to justify the proposed increases of oil tankers being loaded out of Westridge and sailed through Metro Vancouver continuously. Clearly accidents do happen.
7841 2018-12-08 21:51:18 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪

7843 2018-12-08 21:51:05 Try making popcorn with ghee instead of oil, although adding a dash of truffle oil is amazing. Yes, on the stove.
7844 2018-12-08 21:51:03 Hey Amazon sent me a sampler of POWER UP BRAIN OCTANE OIL, ROCKET FUEL FOR BRAIN AND BODY should I try it
7845 2018-12-08 21:51:01 Too much space,plus there’s oil...
7846 2018-12-08 21:50:32 I slept with olive oil in my hair last night and I swear my hair has never been this silky smooth
7847 2018-12-08 21:50:28 this guy at my job was trying to cook eggs we ran out of butter instead of using oil or the cooking spray he tried using cream cheese 
7848 2018-12-08 21:50:18 Tea tree oil is good
7849 2018-12-08 21:49:59 I need a heating oil connect or someone that knows how to convert a system over.
7850 2018-12-08 21:49:58 Busting on oil companies and energy lobbyists is a mantra I've been hearing since the 60's. Ecology smarts is a no brainer but when we start taxing people in order to redistribute the wealth it just all rings hollow. Millions of intelligent people doubt it.
7851 2018-12-08 21:49:52 Damn, I'm so hungry. But is that oil with the bread?  
7852 2018-12-08 21:49:51 Just another Hallmark holiday sponsored by Murphy's oil soap.
7853 2018-12-08 21:49:50 They put an oil embargo on japan because of their atrocities against the Chinese I’m sure
7854 2018-12-08 21:49:40 How long do you believe it would take for the world to become 100% green? And how many will you send jobless into this green state? Coal workers, oil workers, drivers delivering the product. Boat crews ect. and their families. Maybe you can twittle your nose Samantha. Heavens.
7855 2018-12-08 21:49:39 I suggest a quality and real CBD oil. Helps me.
7856 2018-12-08 21:49:35 Except if you are reading Game of thrones In that case your stress levels increase 105%
7857 2018-12-08 21:49:28 @Pro_Oil_Change Your employees in Erin Mills really don’t want to work. They claim their jacks can’t lift my small SUV - Kia Sportage. Want to start their Saturday night early. Worst service!
7858 2018-12-08 21:49:10 Indeed. Gotta love the bluster of the oil industry. It'll be all they have fairly soon. Sooner here in Canada.
7859 2018-12-08 21:49:10 Yeah. It’s a state of mind!

7865 2018-12-08 21:48:36 If people would wise up and actually get angry when they heard that "progressive" politicians were taking money from oil companies, maybe there'd be some hope, but it's looking pretty fucking bleak from here.
7866 2018-12-08 21:48:18 The global financial system needs to be reset and tightly regulated. Then the oil game. Then the paid off politicians and media talking heads.
7867 2018-12-08 21:48:04 Not true - they have exempted the major buyers of Iran oil from sanctions. That effectively restores the status quo for Iran in terms of oil revenues. China, India, S. Korea, Japan & a few others. It creates exceptions & allows them access to foreign exchange needed for terrorism
7868 2018-12-08 21:47:46 I might do this to mine to get her all situated to slide with no oil issues compared to normal
7869 2018-12-08 21:47:30 Nobody wants it, you may as well tell me you want more whale oil. It's 2018 dude.
7870 2018-12-08 21:47:25 I thought it was olive oil at first
7871 2018-12-08 21:47:20 @realDonaldTrump I go to China, one that oil flows as usual, about child separation when I go to people closely coordinat…
7872 2018-12-08 21:47:20 That's great and I don't dispute that. I 100% know we need to transition. But it won't happen tomorrow. Everyday the population grows and energy requirements are higher. Solar panels require aluminum, plastics, etc which all require oil production. It's not as simple as elim. Oil
7873 2018-12-08 21:47:16 They want an oil changed for the low not 1000 dollars
7874 2018-12-08 21:47:13 どやフェス4ではバラード色が強めで、それはもちろん到達、優勝の域だったのですが、#どりーま の濃厚なセトリに語彙力を失わずにはいられないのです。サヨナラの合図 は何百回も聴いた大好きな曲なので聴けて本当にうれしかったです。

7875 2018-12-08 21:47:07 Could render him down for oil, Macquarie Island style
7876 2018-12-08 21:47:03 Well..good luck. Wear your best beige cardigan and dust off your festive toupee. And for chrissakes, oil the wheels on that rascal of yours. I can hear you from here.
7877 2018-12-08 21:46:56 I asked my mom if I should get a new jacket for winter or get my oil changed, hoping she would hear the desperation in my voice.

She said, “have fun taking the bus in your new clothes lol” 

Bitch.
7878 2018-12-08 21:46:25 Giuliani violated all NYC building; placed 20,000 gallons of fuel oil on the fifth floor. I-beams smashed into building seven and it caught fire. What you're saying here it that the most heavily guarded building in NYC was filled with explosives and no one talked. Neat trick.
7879 2018-12-08 21:46:23 BREAKFAST 
2 suasage links (unflavoured) 
2 strips of bacon 
2 scrambled eggs 
Coffee with Splenda 

LUNCH 
Salad with iceberg lettuce (no romaine rn), small amount of carrots and tomato, grilled chicken, with olive oil and a dressing. 
Diet Coke 

DINNER 
Tacos with lettuce…
7880 2018-12-08 21:46:13 We produce the most oil as in processed but we're not the number one exporter.

7885 2018-12-08 21:45:09 I’ve elected to have coffee with cream and coconut oil and sit on my arse.
7886 2018-12-08 21:45:02 Giving myself a hot oil treatment as soon as I get home.
7887 2018-12-08 21:45:01 “Why do you need cbd oil?” Try being in the passenger seat of my boyfriends truck in busy traffic 
7888 2018-12-08 21:45:00 Try high potency CBD oil. There’s a VERY active, helpful users group on Facebook that you can join. I think it’s called cbd oil users. So many people comment about the anxiety relief. It’s completely legal. I buy from Lazarus Naturals but the user site can point you to thes
7889 2018-12-08 21:44:43 So in actuality we are better to separate and have sovereignty over our resources. Fuck Ottawa they have never done anything for us in Alberta. The First Trudeau took our oil revenues.
7890 2018-12-08 21:44:37 ur idea of cost is simply expenses, labor, materials ... nothing more. blockbuster is capitalism at work ... oil and gas is blockbuster .. it will be replaced .. i agree we dont need to fight it .. but we do .. so many are fighting innovation its not like blockbuster

7894 2018-12-08 21:43:59 Correct maybe over the top and the pair of em. Need a wank but they're being labelled to millions. Of. People as racist unjustifiably
7895 2018-12-08 21:43:51 Assuming the move happens, situation would start off as Giants-like, not Hitmen or Oil Kings. I could see that changing as time goes by.
7896 2018-12-08 21:43:49 This why girls don’t get they oil change, been waiting a whole damn hour. And I call these niggas before I even pulled up to this hoe o’ lying ass
7897 2018-12-08 21:43:43 No, we aren't the number one exporter of oil. We buy oil and export processed oil but we do not lead in exporting crude oil which is what is required for the oil market to even be a market. That would be Saudi Arabia, just as I said.
7898 2018-12-08 21:43:15 What cuticle oil do u use cause damn they look stunning

and so it begins

the glut cometh

@rosstessien was on to something #EV #oil #ice
7908 2018-12-08 21:42:07 So after reading the entire article all you have to comment on is the words "tar sands" to which half the world still calls the oil sands. No comment on where OUR refiners get their oil or the true numbers of just where we import our oil from.
7909 2018-12-08 21:42:02 I won this bottle of Neroli oil from an amazon bouncy box.  Got it today and it smells like old lady in a bottle.  I can't get the smell out of my nose! Ahhhhhh! 
7910 2018-12-08 21:41:53 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
7911 2018-12-08 21:41:48 Which essential oil is best for getting people to stop talking to you
7912 2018-12-08 21:41:41 The French, whom I love, are known as the people who “live in paradise and think they’re in hell”. Truer words have never been spoken. Sure, plenty of reforms are needed to properly oil this machine & boost the economy, but everything they have is taken for granted. Grrrrr. 
7913 2018-12-08 21:41:38 I sell organic oil for hair/ skin care and black soap suitable for all skin types at very affordable prices...
7914 2018-12-08 21:41:35 Goes to take nice relaxing coconut oil bath.... spills entire wineglass in tub... I can not girl gracefully
7915 2018-12-08 21:41:21 I don’t know Winnipeg well enough to have any expectation. I’ve literally been there once for a conference in the burbs. But the approach sounds more Giants than Hitmen/Oil Kings.
7916 2018-12-08 21:41:21 whale oil beef hooked
7917 2018-12-08 21:41:06 I hate when y’all do photoshoots and put baby oil all over your body.
7918 2018-12-08 21:40:43 If we will drill and refine our oil, we can out produce the Middle East.  We can sell oil as an export and cut the costs to Americans. In its many forms (shale oil, crude oil), the US has an abundance of oil for generations to come.
7919 2018-12-08 21:40:38 idk what electricity water is but im glad your snake oil works
7920 2018-12-08 21:40:36 i remember one time my bf made fried rice and put too much sesame oil that was a terribe day
7921 2018-12-08 21:40:29 Never seen this but I saw “Coconut oil” “acacia” and “sulfate free” which are all very good things, lol. I’m actually bout to run out of Honest Amish Ima check the price I might  scoop 
7922 2018-12-08 21:40:27 Least he doesn't hit opponents when they're down. You're gonna need some CBD oil to sleep tonight mate, as you're still buzzing from the savage beating you gave Paz. #gotpaidtoliedown

7924 2018-12-08 21:40:07 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
7925 2018-12-08 21:40:06 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

7927 2018-12-08 21:40:04 Libs in the replies like “he ran a very successful oil company he is very good and smart” lmaoooooooo
7928 2018-12-08 21:40:02 Fear mongering? Easy for someone living in Calgary and working in the oil & gas industry to say. A great number of people here, where these oil tankers will be traveling aren’t against them because they spoil our view. It’s because of these very real spill and fire risks.
7929 2018-12-08 21:39:47 I've no other strange to report......I've more CBD oil now so here's hoping I can feel less anxious.
7930 2018-12-08 21:39:46 So the saturated fat in olive oil is good for me and the saturated fat in bacon is not????
7931 2018-12-08 21:39:33 Hello my friend how do you know the olives oil is real or mixed ?

7933 2018-12-08 21:39:15 Blame macron for taxing their oil for their cars.

7935 2018-12-08 21:38:54 Try a straightening brush,  and morracon oil. Also, put a pea size amount of lotion on your hands, rub them together, then apply all over your hair and slowly brush through again. This is what works for me. My hair is super thick, a little wavy, and frizzy
7936 2018-12-08 21:38:51 it wasn't an intent of war with iraq or any other countries until they got worried about us taking their oil because we were in saudi arabia and kuwait during the 80s and 90s buying lots of oil from them. thats when they started to get scared that we might do the same to them

7939 2018-12-08 21:38:26 Glad you feel so strongly about an oil industry insider... I will take your statement as indication that US taxpayers will no longer be paying $5B a year in oil industry subsidies ( welfare).? Go ahead @realDonaldTrump , we will wait for u to pull back the subsidies.
7940 2018-12-08 21:38:19 I’m certainly not agreeing with Trump and saying bring back the coal jobs.  But I think it’s unrealistic to think that we can just turn off oil production any time soon.  Really, we need some major R&D and an energy revolution.  We need another Norman Borlaug.
7941 2018-12-08 21:38:06 perdon, una mala interpretacion, respondo a q si, y son como las enumerastes en un twit anterior...Venezuela esta a nivel d iraq '90 despues d la guerra golfo q era oil for food y d vaina
7942 2018-12-08 21:37:56 Is this the lef’s winning argument? That we’re going to continue burning oil...just not oil from Canada? What a joke.

7946 2018-12-08 21:37:32 You had better hope oil prices don't drop lower unless you want the press to follow laid of oil workers to the food bank. I'm sure that'll make for some great press.

7948 2018-12-08 21:37:29 yo what kinda essential oil will fix dis flat ass
7949 2018-12-08 21:37:28 Yes. We had lying dogs before. We all knew it but Nixon created EPA and 500 other programs. Rockerfeller center, Carnegie Hall. But the one of first monopolies we broke up was Standard Oil, in part because they also tried to patent automobile itself, not allowing Ford to build!
7950 2018-12-08 21:37:26 If you're defending oil companies and the politicians who take their money, you're doing much worse than that. This isn't a problem that gets solved by composting and driving less.

7987 2018-12-08 21:33:37 No our military budget wasn't depleted by that much and Saudi Arabia is the number one exporter of oil followed by Russia. Goodbye. Blocked.
7988 2018-12-08 21:33:36 Oil then wash your face. Be careful the oil may or may not break you out
7989 2018-12-08 21:33:34 No, we don't. We just know our efforts are better spent cleaning up our own yard as #tarsands oil is much worse for the environment than Saudi "sweet" crude.
Nice try at redirection though.
7990 2018-12-08 21:33:12 Oh trust me I’m well aware. I’d still take it over the Four Loko at this point.

The correct answer here is clearly motor oil, IMO
7991 2018-12-08 21:32:54 But wouldn't it be great if AB was selling oil at $50-$55!  The US is the wild card - production is way up.  They are, perhaps, now the largest producer in the world. We can compete but we need east & west pipelines.

8035 2018-12-08 21:29:14 Yeah, because most cities remained accords-compliant anyways. Only an idiot would throw away the Climate Accords to pander to coal and oil companies. Definitely not looking at you.
8036 2018-12-08 21:29:05 We desperately need to be held accountable for the wars and conflicts we start in other nations. We go in, grab their oil and other resources and then abandon them to civil unrest or starvation. Also, the end-users that allow drug lords to exist are United States citizens.

8039 2018-12-08 21:28:30 As someone who has combination, it’s really just ok. Like my oil will actually shine through at the end of the day but other than that it’s fine. Very buildable too.
8040 2018-12-08 21:28:08 Macron raises the price of diesel fuel (via taxes) and Paris burns. Now we need a Middle Eastern expert to diagnose the trouble in Europe. Guess I will volunteer for the job: "It's all about oil."
8041 2018-12-08 21:28:03 Actually we aren't in the top TEN exporters of oil, even after supporting N.K. Nothing has improved as far as relations. We don't need a boosted military, the budget is over inflated and we could have free healthcare and education that would improve the state of our country.
8042 2018-12-08 21:27:53 Look around flint Michigan is still a mess, local govt did underhanded thing that got caught by epa but lead still there, govt gave free reign to use percussion grenades at standing rock blowing up a woman’s arm for oil and gas Corp. the public is aware of the situation.

8044 2018-12-08 21:27:46 Agreed, but oil prices are down globally. Mr. Trump wanted them so...
8045 2018-12-08 21:27:45 Good point. Makes you wonder who's been thwarting 'energy innovation' this whole time - if the independence from oil would mean not just freedom from OPEC, but freedom for the peoples under the thumb of said royalty...

It really depends on how often you fry things, how big things are, and if you're trying to cut oil in your diet

8055 2018-12-08 21:26:44 If your talking the tar on the California coastline, it’s all natural & has zero to do with people. The natural sea floor seeps natural oil & tar which is how the Carpinteria & La Brea Tar Pits came to be, oil & tar bubbling up from the ground on it’s own.
8056 2018-12-08 21:26:36 I'm sure you have the numbers - but if oil exports are actually up, it is because of high-cost rail shipping and US demand for $25 oil.  Selling oil for less than 1/2 the market value doesn't help AB or Canada.

8076 2018-12-08 21:24:15 Notwithstanding China’s solar and wind efforts, it is building as many coal plants as the entire US coal grid. That is a sobering fact. Meanwhile in Canada we have an oil sands emissions cap (agreed to by industry). Why some Canadians keep fighting Canadian O&G is sad

8080 2018-12-08 21:23:53 What stops 2-3 major book publishers from making a deal with Google or Apple to take on Amazon? I don’t think Amazon has abused their dominant position in books so far. 

Books are quite different than oil or rail monopolies that had to be broken up & were kinda a public good 1/2
8081 2018-12-08 21:23:52 Duh. Tar sands requires high oil prices to be profitable. Of course production was scaled back in a low-price environment. You're a special kind of stupid, aren't ya?

8094 2018-12-08 21:22:39 You missed the boat. Yes your row boat. God forbid you use any oil byproducts
8095 2018-12-08 21:22:38 1. How are you picking which cows to cull without tradeable quota and farmers choosing that themselves? 

2. Undermining the only tool that can put a cost on carbon and a profit motive for new tech is harming our climate. It was bad enough when this undermining came from big oil.
8096 2018-12-08 21:22:37 You gotta brush about King.... Water.... Oil..... Brush.... Brush
8097 2018-12-08 21:22:32 More likely their cities become uninhabitable when they run out of oil to desalinize ocean water & sell to pay for imported food.

I suggest discounting technological chicks before they hatch. Industrialized world likely to crash as well. Plan accordingly. Good luck.

8100 2018-12-08 21:22:10 My friends in  oil land in Alberta choose to watch cartoons rather than the news, because they don't want to get involved in the mad wash of propaganda they live in. And when I try to talk about it, they just avoid me.  We can't force them to wake up.
8101 2018-12-08 21:21:46 Yeah. Liverpool are competing with us with the same resources and with the same goal. City are just one arm of a global oil machine. Their victories just feel like notes on a balance sheet

8105 2018-12-08 21:21:11 the oil tho
8106 2018-12-08 21:21:07 Surely you know that the oil companies are as invested in new energy technologies as they are oil. They've said so. And it's commons sense.

8110 2018-12-08 21:20:50 I think AB is well past the point of being deluded into thinking things are OK. @jkenney could try & put on a brave face but it would do no good - the facts (oil prices; oil exports; business investment; foreign investment; unemployment; jobs) are already known. AB is in TROUBLE!
8111 2018-12-08 21:20:45 #BreaktimeGoodtimes Get the oil changed in your car
8112 2018-12-08 21:20:40 China spends more on semiconductor imports than it does on oil.  - The Economist.  Nerd me finds that to be interesting.
8113 2018-12-08 21:20:10 Good luck with Quebec not on board. @francoislegault will suck up over half the transfer payments but wants nothing to do with a solution to the oil crisis. SAD.

8115 2018-12-08 21:20:05 This idiocy with allowing the Americans to force you to arrest the Chinese rep from Huawei was so glaringly a pawn move by the USA ! You being the pawn
For Gods sake man do some good for our country ! Start building renewable energy infrastructure now and stop all subsidized oil
8116 2018-12-08 21:20:04 For the debt owed by Jonathan pre 2015 to oil marketers via subsidy. 

Do you get now?
8117 2018-12-08 21:20:00 LMAO. Patchy
8118 2018-12-08 21:19:48 Global oil demand will rise for probably the next 20-30 years. Nations build and export what they are best at and we clearly are world class in this area. Prowess at O&G dvlmpt is not mutually exclusive with clean tech. A strong economy can fund both.
8119 2018-12-08 21:19:46 Quote from article is "port volume" - tonnes seems a fair indicator of volume. "Units" is non-standard as it refers to trucks, cars, etc. A unit of oil doesn't translate into a unit of car, tonnes do translate...better. Also, the majority of RoRo, in units, are passenger cars.
8120 2018-12-08 21:19:46 Interesting listening to the news report on the French protests. They aren't saying the protesters initiated any violence and the only violent images show the over militarised police as the aggressors. 

I wonder how much the police overtime bill will cost the oil corps.
8121 2018-12-08 21:19:45 Trust me man. The days before them oil money freaks ruined it
8122 2018-12-08 21:19:42 Same way PPP has rather led (IMO) to more carelessness on the part of oil coys exacerbating the number of oil spills in Nigeria's Niger delta. Of course, the fines are very weak too. But point is if the economics favour fines / taxes, we might never see emissions reduced.
8123 2018-12-08 21:19:39 especially anything essential oil related dear GOD make it stop somebody please
8124 2018-12-08 21:19:38 It is not logical to say global climate warming does not exist because the serfs can't afford it.

Like saying my car doesn't need an oil change because I can't afford it.

Who do you think will be hurt most by warming?  Not the rich.

Offer solutions!
8125 2018-12-08 21:19:37 Yep, I know oil and sometimes check tires and that’s about it??? Every time there’s a new noise it’s just like 
8126 2018-12-08 21:19:28 I think we all know thoughts and prayers aren’t enough

The are other options to Palm oil which are much less destructive. But no - stop petrol. Because big money.

8133 2018-12-08 21:18:40 Just make political office less attractive i can tell you that 95 percent of those seeking public office will prefer to work in an oil firm . The motivation is simply the juicy benefits and all the pecks of office and the big one the security votes and the constituency projects .
8134 2018-12-08 21:18:33 Had a lovely time at the @bevismarksuk Hanukkah service. Watching seven people light an oil lamp really gives you an appreciation for candles, though.

8137 2018-12-08 21:18:00 To be fair, the only thing I know about winterizing my car is taking it to get an oil change so they do things for me. It has worked great for me for many, many years!

Sun to electricity to mine BTC

8142 2018-12-08 21:17:34 @cathmckenna Minister, you are so disingenuous. How about using Alberta oil in lieu of foreign oil, purchased from dubious source countries? You cannot suck and blow at the same time. Canadians expect more from their government.

8146 2018-12-08 21:17:16 It is you who isn't following along. You want to kill oil and gas subsidies, when that is how most people heat their home. And if you'd read the article, you'd see the subsidies they get are tax right-offs for non-productive wells, etc.

8153 2018-12-08 21:16:33 If he’s got baby oil in his bedroom don’t trust him
8154 2018-12-08 21:16:31 My analysis was that the OPEC oil crisis of the late 1970’s was a warning against the eventual depletion of this non-renewable resource and that, if our demand for petroleum was not eliminated, we would engage in more desperate, naturally destructive measures to extract it,
8155 2018-12-08 21:16:28 I don’t know anyone who’s supported Man City from before 2012/ oil money
8156 2018-12-08 21:16:22 Well that's gonna end real quick. Since you are desperately linking people P.T.S.D with the pain from bone cancer! Trying to get someone to do the downward dog isn't going to stop that pain from happening. Or shove a bunch of lavender oil up their nose is gonna stop it either.
8157 2018-12-08 21:16:07 I hope we can become self sufficient when it comes to oil and not have to buy from foreign sources.
8158 2018-12-08 21:15:43 fossil fuel is the past, clean energy the future you want to higher emission standards  and drill for oil offshore , your no friend to the environment

8160 2018-12-08 21:15:12 I don't remember the 70s being a part of that "prosperity" at all. We still had a manufacturing base, but it was on shaky ground. Oil embargo and inflation. Entire cities heading into bankruptcy. (I think it came to an abrupt end in 1970.)

8162 2018-12-08 21:14:52 but since we made this mistake until now, to share all our revenue from the oil with Quebec and Ontario, which benefitted for decades from Alberta, I would love to separate from the East.. If we kept our billions of dollars in our side, no crisis would have worried us at all!
8163 2018-12-08 21:14:30 Kevin , kevin, kevin. Middle eastern oil is not dirty, coming from a country where they still beat their wives

8168 2018-12-08 21:14:16 Dear chuck. The sun. Look it up. It’s not a left vs. right thing. I also love that about 100 years ago the coal industry was at war with the oil industry.  Nice try though my man. Swing and a miss. This  isn’t a partisan issue. Things will change in lieu of right vs. left.
8169 2018-12-08 21:14:12 Peppermint oil, seriously.
8170 2018-12-08 21:14:11 Unfortunately you clearly don’t have a clue. Let it go, don’t embarrass yourself further. Allah rahmet eylesin to the victims.

8188 2018-12-08 21:12:36 @Huawei even if you guys were selling Parts while there was a sanction it was only because the USA was going there for oil and killing innocent people. Not to mention I don't see anyone in the states being charged for selling weapons to the Middle East. #hauweistays

8207 2018-12-08 21:10:44 ... and how many have put a CEO of the world's largest oil company in charge of international relations for the nation?
8208 2018-12-08 21:10:43 How about a tariff on all Oil imports from outside of North America.
8209 2018-12-08 21:10:37 Mmmm roasted with olive oil, garlic, spinach with chicken
8210 2018-12-08 21:10:31 Your car runs off water ? 
It also needs oils to keep things lubricated. It's also made from plastics and other oil by products, shoes contain rubber,  electronic devices are oil by products as well how.
How do you  propose millions of people heat their  homes ? In Canada alone
8211 2018-12-08 21:10:27 what essential oil do I use to get laid
8212 2018-12-08 21:10:14 The real problem is our oil consumption. But until we're ready to drastically cut back, oil has to be transported. Pipelines are the least bad option. Far better than trucks or trains.
8213 2018-12-08 21:10:03 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
8214 2018-12-08 21:09:55 Not interested in what the shell guy said it's all about what Obama said. he boosted Oil production to unseen levels in this country. I'm inclined to believe him.
8215 2018-12-08 21:09:51 Indeed, I make it the old-fashioned way: corn in oil in a pot on the stove.
8216 2018-12-08 21:09:42 I use all that. Bio oil. Coco butter. ALLLLLL OF IT 
8217 2018-12-08 21:09:37 Arab royalty is known for imprisoning and murdering family members, activists and journalists who expose and embarrass them. 

But when their oil is replaced by energy innovation and their desert cities become uninhabitable (global warming) Arabs will rise and destroy them.
8218 2018-12-08 21:09:14 Just as a car runs in gasoline to function, the oil of the @OfficialPDPNig is falsehood. Unfortunately, #AwaEyesHaveOpened. #NextLevel is the way to go. @MBuhari and @ProfOsinbajo till 2023.
8219 2018-12-08 21:09:08 Not abandon the province, oil. Trudeau is not abandoning them but if people keep voting conservative because they don’t want to deal with getting different jobs then what can he do? A carbon tax to help pay for the hard times to come sure, but even that is getting push back.
8220 2018-12-08 21:09:06 @TriathlonCally I love a facial oil to send me off to sleep especially rose
8221 2018-12-08 21:09:03 You can use any rice. I use organic Jasmine rice & put a few drops of lavender essential oil in it.
8222 2018-12-08 21:09:01 It is fossil fuels that provide the material to make rubber which is in just about everything you own, that comes from oil. Makeup that women put on has patrolium jelly in it, which is from oil. If you want to have food in your house, it was delivered by fossil fuels.
8223 2018-12-08 21:08:59 What defends the naira? FX earnings... From oil. Which was trading at high of Over $100/barrel around the time of occupy Nigeria. You have any idea how much we would have saved in Fx earnings and used to diversify the economy? We keep lying to ourselves when we are to blame
8224 2018-12-08 21:08:59 (The vinegar in the oil for your eyes doesn’t cure anything, but you will be crying so hard you won’t mind the disaster from the enemas the least little bit).
8225 2018-12-08 21:08:54 High quality AND oil. I get mine from an apothecary that makes it locally. There should be an apothecary in your area
8226 2018-12-08 21:08:42 When did climate doom become strict orthodoxy? 

To believe the science records change and causation is rational. To believe that science is prophetic gives scientists undeserved trust.

Based on the science of my formative years, we’re supposed to be in an ice age with no oil.
8227 2018-12-08 21:08:38 Stuffed up/snotty nose??? Put a little tea tree oil around your nostrils
8228 2018-12-08 21:08:28 Make sure you rinse salt thoroughly off the chickpeas if you're using canned ones. Add some olive oil, paprika, curd and tahini, if you have it. Blend thoroughly in magic bullet. drizzle with olive oil.
8229 2018-12-08 21:08:24 They need much maintenance! Especially bathing! Otherwise you wind up w a bare cat and oil slicks or deposits on the skin. Bathing once a week is advised. You’ll have time due to less vacuuming!
FYI, you can mute the other convo if it gets too
8230 2018-12-08 21:08:17 Unfortunately Nathan i dont think it will make a difference.  What will probably happen will be something new comes in which will cost the experienced guy time and money but doesnt close the back door to those who should not be in plumbing never mind gas . But good luck
8231 2018-12-08 21:08:14 Snake oil salesman!
8232 2018-12-08 21:08:08 Making a rosewater and essential oil spray moisturizer and trying to see how this come out.
8233 2018-12-08 21:08:04 Rex Tillerson was CEO of a huge corporation and has no moral values in my opinion. I think he took the job because EXXON had oil deals in Russia. I would never defend him or trump and I withdraw my bot comment. Despise both of them.
8234 2018-12-08 21:07:52 They would be electric so no oil
8235 2018-12-08 21:07:49 Cuz the climate impacts of the kinds of decisions the Energy Committee could make in the next two years are potentially quite large. More oil drilling & coal mining on public lands, for example.
8236 2018-12-08 21:07:48 cook them w oil (how much im not really sure she just does it by habit and can see when theyre done). W mayo or lemon juice they are great. Tried making them once and it flopped for me tho but u seem like a good cooker so.
8237 2018-12-08 21:07:47 A sigh of pleasure slips past Damon's lips at the sight. He tightens his thighs around the larger male's hips, his eager fingers roaming across Asmodeus's incredible body. Oil is getting everywhere.

"I'm not addicted." Damon bounces slightly in his lap. "I'm...enthusiastic."
8238 2018-12-08 21:07:39 Since the oil revenues are dropping faster then a lead balloon I'm guessing those payments from Albetta are going to start drying up. Where will Que get the eq payments from then?
8239 2018-12-08 21:07:28 Did you notice that Jiffy Pop always tasted like crap?  The concept was fun, but we got better popcorn out of a pan with oil.
8240 2018-12-08 21:07:16 Impact of short shelve live for OIL…
With mass adoption of electric cars next year in US, Europe and China ,  OPEC/RUSSIA cartel will have a tough time keeping oil prices from dropping substantially below current levels.
8241 2018-12-08 21:07:03 Hope Quebec enjoys the increased oil train traffic. If Irving Oil wants Alberta Oil it will get to them somehow. Does Quebec want the Oil shipments going thru their downtowns, rail or going around their towns, pipelines?
8242 2018-12-08 21:06:47 A lot of gall (g'oil)
8243 2018-12-08 21:06:46 Which resources? If you're talking about oil there are plenty of alternatives
8244 2018-12-08 21:06:42 @VirginMediaNews  Would you be interested in a Human Interest story especially on the run up to Christmas involving an elderly couple, an oil theft an Oil spill and a community come together?
8245 2018-12-08 21:06:30 ok ok you're right about coconut oil but WHO DID THIS TO JANET LMFAO
8246 2018-12-08 21:06:27 おっはー(寒い)
8247 2018-12-08 21:06:11 Il finanziamento Oil Free nel 2016 ha sostituito molte caldaie pubbliche gasolio ed ancora oggi c’è un finanziamento fondo perduto per ammodernare e efficientare condominii. Pullman, auto private, furgoni con oltre dieci anni, circolano quasi senza controllo...
8248 2018-12-08 21:06:09 You would have thought having oil barons as owners would come with some push for the title. But we're just a cog in a money-making machine. Barely anything about our squad screams title challenger and now the manager is at odds with our best player.
8249 2018-12-08 21:06:08 No it won't- if you're a party committed to a massive programme of road-building, you approve of airport expansion, and you want to protect the oil and gas industry- you aren't serious about tackling the climate crisis
8250 2018-12-08 21:06:06 A carbon tax will not save the planet.  Nationalizing all oil industries is the only correct action. You on board, Neera?
8251 2018-12-08 21:05:57 CBD oil, oil products and hemp products are legal in GA. As with all things, all CBD oil is not equal. Purity and extraction methods are important.
8252 2018-12-08 21:05:49 Doing it wrong!!!
It’s 15 liters of ORGANIC apple cider vinegar ENEMAS! If you’re REALLY sick, you should add ground mica and twice brewed coffee grounds that were pick by a Dali. 
Doesn’t anyone read anymore???? 
Also, add the ACV to the coconut oil for your eyes...
8253 2018-12-08 21:05:45 Even if we use motor oil?
8254 2018-12-08 21:05:45 It certainly isn’t just because of oil prices although that may have been the final straw. From what I’ve been seeing, the people seem to be waking up to the fact that their rights are being denied.The UN migrant act also fanned the fires.
8255 2018-12-08 21:05:38 Watched it 10.times and can't see apparent racial abuse I've had a few mind
8256 2018-12-08 21:05:31 Tear rubber!!! Life vegetable oil!!
8257 2018-12-08 21:05:30 Wash sheets, go through clothes, rearrange room, almost die, clean room, fucking spill rosehip oil all over sheets fucking murder me I deserve nothing good. I need some pedialyte
8258 2018-12-08 21:05:28 Here btw, mad props to @IcelandFoods. They went from being relevant cause they had Kerry Katona in their ads to making a stand against deforestation by stopping using palm oil. If that's not personal growth that we've all witnessed before our very eyes I don't know what is #tbqh
8259 2018-12-08 21:05:25 The Fresh Oil can be very Aggressive

-The Fresh Oil on Samson made him grab a lion & tore it into two. Judges 14:5-6.

-Also, the first day Elisha got the Fresh Oil he

- Crossed Jordan
- He solved the problem of the city of Jericho- 
-He Silenced his mockers

8260 2018-12-08 21:05:25 Will the oil cleanser be restocked under this promo? I just received mine & already want some more 
8261 2018-12-08 21:05:05 There's also a full page block with suggestions on how to order at restaurants that is basically How To Be A Nightmare Customer "Can the chef please prepare me a plate of the freshest legumes available, stir fried without oil or butter?"
8262 2018-12-08 21:04:57 You look like me after I'm done fighting my oil burner. Its a highly underrated survival tactic.
8263 2018-12-08 21:04:56 It’s so cold, the coconut oil in my hair solidified.
8264 2018-12-08 21:04:55 Despite McDonnell's comments on protecting the Oil and Gas industry?
8265 2018-12-08 21:04:51 Would you be interested in a Human Interest story especially on the run up to Christmas involving an elderly couple, an oil theft an Oil spill and a community come together? @rte
8266 2018-12-08 21:04:47 Shell knows that solar and wind energy need oil and coal plants as a backup. Every sensible ecologist should reject renewable energy since all the oil compagnies support it
8267 2018-12-08 21:04:47 pat is at the tic tock diner on route 3 snorting a line of olive oil off a meatball parm forgetting he has a Russian hooker in the trunk of your ford!
8268 2018-12-08 21:04:28 Oh, get a life.
Canadian oil is better than all the others.
8269 2018-12-08 21:04:19 Dag, you’re in Norway and are fully aware state wealth is thanks to the high oil export income.
This is like Australia which boasts increasing renewable use while demolishing whole mountains of brown coal for export to anyone that will pay.
8270 2018-12-08 21:04:13 Would you be interested in a Human Interest story especially on the run up to Christmas involving an elderly couple, an oil theft an Oil spill and a community come together? @rtenews
8271 2018-12-08 21:04:11 There's a link on peta that's States the exact items and what they have in. Barry M have palm oil in loads of items which vegans refuse to use as they're destroying orangutan home's
8272 2018-12-08 21:04:07 As the black fan right their what he heard. Let’s not all jump to conclusions. What I see is home fans shouting abuse at opposing super star player not racial abuse I might add. Everyone ground I’ve gone to home fans shout at throw In& Corners at away players to affect their game
8273 2018-12-08 21:03:55 Finally Got My Oil Changed .
8274 2018-12-08 21:03:45 4| Well He Looked Like a Red Bone Version Of Conor McGregor & Maybe the Picture Of Me I Got Up Now But Taller. And He Always Had That Slicked Over Oil Thing In His Hair. Played Drunk Chess at Night in Cherry Hill (Ghetto) & Talk To the Mayor Or City Cancer From Time To Time.
8275 2018-12-08 21:03:41 That’s the point of the medicinal side of it. It gets you high and gives you relief. There are some things that a no high cbd oil can help with too. It also reduces inflammation and calms you. Being calm is a huge thing when you suffer from chronic illnesses.
8276 2018-12-08 21:03:27 The US gives Israel something like $3 billion a year and people complain about it all the time. You think its politically feasible to give one country 100x that? + all the rest of the oil focused economies? Not realistic
8277 2018-12-08 21:03:23 Like no Oil and gas fracking which probably caused the earthquakes??

8281 2018-12-08 21:03:03 Le gaz oil était trop chère pour remplir son 4x4. Elle ne parlait pas de pouvoir d'achat elle au début, elle doit bien gagner pour se payer tel véhicule, juste essence et voilà la merde qu'elle a mis
8282 2018-12-08 21:03:01 Chuck - Are you going to start positioning for a return to Whale oil to power our lamps at night? Nuclear and solar can entirely remove our dependency on fossil fuels - and coal is just plain stupid; this is not that hard...
8283 2018-12-08 21:02:47 Most likely refused to buy his CBD oil
8284 2018-12-08 21:02:43 (2)
The human output per year currently matches the amount of CO2 captured in plants within 1 million years (the plants which became oil).

It also matches the output of the volcanoes in siberia 250 million years ago, according to a german institute

8286 2018-12-08 21:02:28 I adopted my Tommy from the county pound about 5 yrs ago. Sadly, his first owners had his front claws removed. They must still hurt, because in winter, he likes to keep his paws under a radiator-type oil heater. Keeps them warm. Arthritis maybe? 
8287 2018-12-08 21:02:26 im at Walmart getting an oil change and the light sensor keeps turning off cause i haven’t moved an inch. i am an enigma
8288 2018-12-08 21:02:23 It had me questioning everything and feeling like shit most of the time behind a smiling mask and a cloud of frankincense essential oil.

8289 2018-12-08 21:02:02 Coconut oil is amazing
8290 2018-12-08 21:02:00 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle with water, spray your garage and all door frames, then watch the spiders run!
8291 2018-12-08 21:01:54 What was the value of the dollar to the naira when we decide to take away subsidies in 2012 and how much was oil price then. Between 2012-206 how much fx savings would we have accrued if we understood that subsidising consumption is not sound economically.
8292 2018-12-08 21:01:53 Jurgens tricky reds>>>> Arab oil money
8293 2018-12-08 21:01:48 I think NBC is overdoing it with Bush. He was just an ok President at best. And including “Gampy” in the title. No. He wasn’t America’s gampy in the slightest. He’s an elite east coaster, turned oil magnate that never had to worry about money his whole life.
8294 2018-12-08 21:01:47 All I am asking you is this, what FRSC said it it wrong? Is it wrong fr them to ask him to be cautious, re evaluate and stay safe?
You don't blame everything on destiny, you do your part.
8295 2018-12-08 21:01:45 @IcelandFoods really disappointed that all your Christmas pudding contain palm oil or palm fat! #Nopalmoil #icelandadvert
8296 2018-12-08 21:01:44 @realDonaldTrump  Trump EPA is attempting to reinterpret the WOTUS rule in a way that allows oil giants, real estate developers, and golf course owners to freely pollute rivers and streams. Critics have pointed out that Trump's businesses may stand to profit from any weakening
8297 2018-12-08 21:01:39 Wow! Tell us what you really think, huh? Tillerson asked for it. The guy has tar all over his heels. He was looking for the big O climax in oil. Trump had an opportunity to observe. Who were his lunch mates again? Whoops, I said too much...

8304 2018-12-08 21:00:40 Exactly the point I will be talking to them about
8305 2018-12-08 21:00:38 The government didn't have to buy it, and we didn't have to build the pipeline. Why not build refineries to create Canadian jobs and stop buying back our own oil at a premium from the US?
8306 2018-12-08 21:00:30 Exactly. dont think that's the situation in the training centres when novice college folk with no real experience are told come back with a portfolio and its all go Thats just wrong My late tutor from college referred to those allowing this to happen as sock cuckers or something
8307 2018-12-08 21:00:30 Soooo I’m in my house in my room .. my mom is visiting and came in with out knocking... I got a blunt in my mouth.. and all she say is “where’s the oil”.... this shit was awkward.. blunt in my mouth and I’m in my own shit  why was this awkward?
8308 2018-12-08 21:00:27 If you think about it, how could the foreign policy of a waning hegemon NOT be run by a heavily indebted frat boy whose bff is the ruthless price of a kingdom awash with oil and cash located in the most unstable part of a turbulent world?
8309 2018-12-08 21:00:12 He's actually kicked Scheer and Kenney in the nads a few times. It's more like he's doing PR work for Big Oil, along with Rex Murphy. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it's all pro bono.

8323 2018-12-08 20:59:11 Which most of the CEO s of oil companies agreed with
8324 2018-12-08 20:59:09 I’m sure this post will come with mixed reviews and opinions; and I welcome both sides. 
Thoughts on CBD oil? Benefits? Drawbacks? Negatives? 

Lay it out there for me, I’m highly debating it for numerous reasons.
8325 2018-12-08 20:59:04 That was the original idea, cos it was an industrial pot grower hoping to get a bunch of land super cheap & turn it into a "pot mecca", but they didn't take the actual cost & logistics into account and wound up selling it to an oil company - likely less interested in distribution
8326 2018-12-08 20:59:02 Tickets in LA and Anaheim are cheap too. 
Both were lower bowl to the right of centre ice where Oil shot twice...

8328 2018-12-08 20:58:56 Awww diddums. It seems @matthewsyed doesn’t like people pointing out he committed copyright infringement. So he’s blocked me. Petty can now be added to the long list of descriptions for the snake oil salesman
8329 2018-12-08 20:58:52 @realDonaldTrump Mike Pompeo is a Kansas Tea-Party, Freedom Caucus imbecile with zero finesse, meeting with foreign leaders of nations and armies as though he knows what's going on.  The pic of him with Saudi prince is a joke.  Tillerson headed Exxon, the largest American oil

8334 2018-12-08 20:58:30 Put 3 drops of peppermint oil on your temple. It works for me!
8335 2018-12-08 20:58:28 Blend 100g ginger 150ml soy sauce 150ml olive oil 4 garlic cloves + mixd herbs & one squeezed lemon. Marinade chicken thighs for 4 hours. 45mins in the oven at 150c + 15mins at 220c. You will be in paradise & your whole house will smell like ginger & soy sauce for days.

8340 2018-12-08 20:57:45 why don’t I have an essential oil diffuser  need
8341 2018-12-08 20:57:43 I heard a sound from my car this morning. Came to get an oil change, and they told me it’s a radiator leak. Ain’t this bout a bitch.
8342 2018-12-08 20:57:42 They need to make the price points more comparable then....veg oil is like $1.99 those others are anywhere from $4.99 to $9.99, on a budget many of us can't afford it. Veg oil is fine, if you're not consuming large amounts of fried food!! Or live an active lifestyle.
8343 2018-12-08 20:57:38 u just too good baba more oil for ya head.....kudos bro

8344 2018-12-08 20:57:30 That pipeline is ill conceived and a bad plan. There much better ways to get that oil to a market that would pay full price. But that pipeline is likely going to happen eventually. Reality
8345 2018-12-08 20:57:29 In other words she is a complete and total idiot and paid off by oil and coal.
8346 2018-12-08 20:57:17 This is actually very simple, Quebec isn’t anti oil they are anti Alberta. And Trudeau was born where?
8347 2018-12-08 20:57:11 It’s not just dumb it is blind arrogance. They have no problem taking equalization payments, a massive dump in the St. Lawrence, then buy their oil from despot nations. This social acceptability in Quebec.
8348 2018-12-08 20:56:53 I’m going to look for it. I use that brand coconut oil. Right now I need aloe for this curling iron burn I gave myself today.
8349 2018-12-08 20:56:49 @TCTTV is trying to convince you that if you give them $500 for a bottle of oil, you will be saved.  Or for only $360 you get a lapel pin!! #Ripoff #Brainwash #WeTakeAllMajorCreditCards
8350 2018-12-08 20:56:42 Rt if your ma had you forehead oily af leaving home for school because she prayed for you and rubbed that holy oil on your head?
8351 2018-12-08 20:56:35 We get like 11% of our oil from SA. We make more here, ourselves. See Canada also.
8352 2018-12-08 20:56:31 country folks been cookin hot oil(not grease) all dey lives. Cookin aint got shit ta do with skinnz
8353 2018-12-08 20:56:23 No not at all. There is massive market just waiting to buy it. China. Which wouldn’t be all bad. It would replace some of the coal they use now. This oil would be a slight improvement. Problem is TransMountain pipeline.
8354 2018-12-08 20:56:17 i chugged a blue gatorade and then threw up in a toilet with blue water, so it didn’t even look like it happened! COOL DAY!

8358 2018-12-08 20:55:38 Ever been to a party and overheard/been part of a conversation where the bulk of it was about getting your oil changed or some such. I see it more and more so I'm curious, when you notice this, do you step up and make the subject interesting or politely scream on the inside?
8359 2018-12-08 20:55:30 I still pull up to the projects to get my oil changed
8360 2018-12-08 20:55:26 @Reshoevn8r will there ever be a way for you to ship Mink oil to Hawaii???
8361 2018-12-08 20:55:22 See, the point is we will make the whole of Chad the 37th state of the Nigerian federation, appoint a governor for the region, take over their oil assets (the north would be happy for this - now they have oil) , pay off their debts to France and we all live happily ever after

8364 2018-12-08 20:55:00 If oil and natural gas are the lifeblood of the Texas economy, the almost 440,000 miles of pipelines are the critical veins and arteries that keep the Lone Star State's economy pumping. RETWEET if you support Texas pipelines!

8371 2018-12-08 20:54:08 My point is that our reliance on oil is going to drop as electrification of our vehicles advances in the next five to ten years. We should be at the forefront of that change together as a nation. Perhaps that pipeline won't be needed then.

8374 2018-12-08 20:53:34 "It's our oil and gas. Full stop. Canada's constitution amended in 1930 said as much: provinces own and control the resources underfoot. And selling for prices below the cost of production isn't fair to the royalty owners — it's also stupid business."

8375 2018-12-08 20:53:33 You change the oil in your fryer? Where's the flava coming from??
8376 2018-12-08 20:53:28 The time to build a pipeline was when there were Con govts in BC, AB, SK, and Ottawa, but they were all happy with selling oil to the US at a discount. 
I'm not ready to forgive the AB govt for decades of mismanagement, and bellying up to the trough with 6 figure expense claims.
8377 2018-12-08 20:53:18 Obviously nobody uses the formal name - Thats my point 

& of course fracking didnt appear over night. In last several years US has approached 10 million bpd, lifted the nearly 50 year ban on exporting oil to foreign markets, & shifted from biggest customer to biggest competitor
8378 2018-12-08 20:53:14 “...while Boot’s depiction of Big Oil might be music to the ears of the green Left that still thinks the world looks like a Thomas Nast cartoon — with titans of industry portrayed as pigs at a trough or fat cats in fancy suits — that’s not the reality.”

You’re cartooning wrongly

8381 2018-12-08 20:53:06 This is a weak elitist obfuscationary tactic that’s obvious to anyone with critical thinking skills. Carbon taxes are a tax on the poor; France still gives billions in subsidies to oil, need I expand? Neoliberalism is the problem, not Russia
8382 2018-12-08 20:53:04 Shirt:cotton. Shoes:Leather. Electronics:silicon,metals,glass, and yes plastics.  Car:hydro.   Point is  oil is useful for some things, like synthetic fabrics, plastics.  But not necessary.  And definitely not needed for energy.

8397 2018-12-08 20:51:01 Lmao. US just discovered it's sitting on another 50B barrels of oil in Texas they can frack cheaply.

What makes you think they would give a tinkers damn about foreign dilbit that Bogarts their refinery capacity when their oil is now so close to their refineries?

8398 2018-12-08 20:50:53 How to buy good quality olive oil:
- check out the type of bottle (dark glass is best)
- sample it: the taste notes should be grassy or floral
- look into polyphenol levels
- make sure it’s first pressed. or do you want to wait til everyone else has had their fun with the olives?
8399 2018-12-08 20:50:53 I saw that on oil company exec seems to have written him a check; I need to look more into that.

8402 2018-12-08 20:50:51 Alberta needs to make oil companies accountable for over production instead of the federal government. it also need to diversify its economy more. If it is so bad out there, then why are you  waiting til Jan to decrease output?

8410 2018-12-08 20:50:22 I often say to customer face to face, after telling them everything that's wrong. 

"Remember the bigger picture, GAS SAFETY"

I don't make recommendations about work required. Just ask when they want me back.
8411 2018-12-08 20:50:10 Ok cool. But this "crisis" is cyclical and happens every single time the global price of oil drops because your economy focuses on one single commodity.

How many times do you need to go through this???

Your efforts should be spent on other resources and economic activities.
8412 2018-12-08 20:50:06 This drop is because US #petroleum is coming in greater part from #fracking than it has before, and the change has dropped the price of #oil. The #US is leading in the world in fracking, and I believe that could hold for the next 5 or even 10 years!
8413 2018-12-08 20:50:05 Think about it this way.  Most people don't pay for car insurance packages that cover all repairs and all oil changes. It wouldn't make sense to.  Everybody knows that you should budget for that stuff.  Vision and dental are similar. Insurance companies will naturally emerge /1

8415 2018-12-08 20:49:55 Yeah, the news about them is out now, though. No doubt they'll have countless huge offers.

My name in Manuel D’Ambrosi, I am interested on of your report :TABLE-Forecasts for World oil demand, supply, stocks. 2012.  May I have the report of Dec. 2017 and the report of Nov. 2018. I cannot find it

8472 2018-12-08 20:43:06 US now a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years. Remember the Carter energy crisis and post-911 dream of getting out from under OPEC's thumb? Finally achieved! Can we end ethanol now too?

Oh wait...

8594 2018-12-08 20:32:59 True, although I am not sure if any other type of politics would be any better. As long as candidates want to get elected, they will be buying our votes. NL can never get out of the financial mess now. Even if oil goes up again, it won't get the province out of the hole.
8595 2018-12-08 20:32:57 Wouldn’t mistake you: I just always thought they had relatively high b12: maybe that just not in oil( them being water soluble) I am trying to remember learning done in the 80s and 90s.. I might dig out that Udo Erasmus book Fats that Heal as internet

8598 2018-12-08 20:32:47 but either way, it looks like the early '80s decline wasn't a function of either oil prices or ag, there was other stuff going on too.

Oil changed and new wipers on the car. 
Groceries done. 
Bills done. 
Blog updated. 
4000 words typed up. 
Working on laundry. 

Time for a nap.
8716 2018-12-08 20:22:55 I’m sure Kyle was a big Man City fan before the oil money came along... I’m very sure of it.
8717 2018-12-08 20:22:34 Uhhh Your Friend has ‘Gone’, like Boy poured Ground nut oil on the floor and she has been mesmerized.
8718 2018-12-08 20:22:34 went in for an oil change and mechanics tell me 1,001 things wrong with my car
8719 2018-12-08 20:22:23 @J_amesp Hey James, I can't track down that tweet you shared ages back w/the global oil/gas pipeline map (I don't recall the content so my search is throwing up nothing) any chance of a reshare? Cheers.

8723 2018-12-08 20:22:12 So how do I know if I need an oil change 
8724 2018-12-08 20:22:11 • gonna carry on w my day. clothes almost finished... next stop oil change. 
8725 2018-12-08 20:22:00 Sorry but Canada can’t be a model for the world with a unemployment rate as high as we have because fools like you and our PM don’t try and help Alberta by limiting imports of oil from outside sources. The world laughs at your stupidity
8726 2018-12-08 20:21:42 Your head geh oil...  Awoni ye ye.
8727 2018-12-08 20:21:34 "overwhelmingly" - i love the unionist dictionary.  It doesn't contain the word 'Scotland ', 'running out' means 'will last for ever', 'oil' means 'a curse' and for some inexplicable reason if you look up both economics and expert, there is a picture of a can of dog food.  Weird!
8728 2018-12-08 20:21:29 Holy shit. Maybe I should stop ignoring those random message requests on Instagram from oil field boys
8729 2018-12-08 20:21:28 Lowest unemployment  in 40 years because people are advocating and stopping oil field jobs like fracking and pipeline  jobs not to mention pushing large manufacters out of the country by so called carbon taxes etc.
8730 2018-12-08 20:21:24 you ever use canola oil just to flex on Italians?

8733 2018-12-08 20:21:05 Nigeria has limited time left to harness its oil wealth. The world is moving beyond oil products. If we don't get out of poverty now, It will be alot harder when oil is less lucrative.
8734 2018-12-08 20:21:01 This "President" is a snake oil saleman.
8735 2018-12-08 20:20:51 " Ocean swelling under the sun; the ocean weeping with black oil. The animals hunted in fear; the animals bursting with the sheer joy of being alive. This sense of "the world in me" is how I always want to feel.(...)" Michael Jackson in his book "Dancing The Dream #MJ
8736 2018-12-08 20:20:51 That’s a little too easy on Bush W. I’m not willing to use Trump as the low bar. Trump’s a blathering dangerous racist imbecile, but he hasn’t started a war (yet). Bush has the blood of hundreds of thousands on his hand for oil. I might add, your Tony shares quite a bit of that.

8758 2018-12-08 20:18:41 then oil companies would buy you make tesla rodster run on 10 miles per gallon
8759 2018-12-08 20:18:29 one time jeremy’s called cbd oil the “cpp oil” and i’m still not over it

8761 2018-12-08 20:18:19 I’m a Canadian taxpaying citizen, and therefore should be asking questions  about stupid decisions within our government. It’s disgusting that almost 70% of our country runs on Saudi Oil, while we sell our product to U.S. refineries at pennies on the dollar.Past PM’s to blame too
8762 2018-12-08 20:18:06 Crien, tomorrow is the perfect opportunity m to ask your pastor for deliverance with a pinch of anointing oil.
8763 2018-12-08 20:18:04 Who wanna pay for my $90 oil change
8764 2018-12-08 20:18:02 Oil Dey ur head
8765 2018-12-08 20:17:49 All seems well to all as long as Alberta is getting far less than market price for our resource? We don’t need to give it away.  Give us fair market value when you say that there is enough oil.  Maybe more local refineries would help.
8766 2018-12-08 20:17:41 1) who owns the land you live on ? Not a black man

3) who creates and passes your state laws ? Not a black man
4) who's importing oil / wholefoods ? Not a black man 
5) Who runs All these health insurance policies? Not a black man
8767 2018-12-08 20:17:30 The sudden silence from blockchain and crypto folks is certainly a welcomed change. What’s the next digital snake oil?
8768 2018-12-08 20:17:25 Honestly, at what point do AB say enough? OTT, land lock AB oil. Charge AB more, take away AB sovereignty and capitulate to migration. 100,000 unemployment, it’s ok OTT will make adjustments to the EI. 
Enough already.....time to go!
8769 2018-12-08 20:17:23 Oil doesn’t need to drop in price!! The gas price is what everyone hopes will fall...except it is usually because of lower oil price...which kills the oil industry. Needs to be 65-70 $/bbl
8770 2018-12-08 20:17:22 They is not. They are doubling down, trying to take out the primary field with smears to smooth the way for Grandpa.

8774 2018-12-08 20:17:09 I see. So is the oil tested for heavy metals and other contaminants? I appreciate that the farming process is organic, but so much of China’s farmland is polluted, and their irrigation water of such poor quality.
8775 2018-12-08 20:17:08 Walking to the store times 300 million people will make a difference, btw. It will also have the effect of starving the oil company beast. If you don't like corporations, that is a win-win. All else is childish avoidance.
8776 2018-12-08 20:17:03 If you talk about the things you are FOR, if you embrace popular policy, you can win many people to your side and probably destroy the Republican Part on their corruption to the oil industry alone.  If you play this dumb wedge, America loses.

8778 2018-12-08 20:16:54 Maybe at some point the conspiratorial BroBrigade will figure out that the reason they can no longer randomly call Neera an oil whore without pushback isn’t bc she’s paying an army of bots, it’s bc folks on here genuinely like her 
8779 2018-12-08 20:16:46 How/why is Hillary Clinton at the wedding of Isha Ambani (daughter of India's richest man, oil-to-telecoms tycoon Mukesh Ambani)? What is their connection? This just reminds me how much of a member of the global elite, she is. And how much she shouldn't have been the nominee
8780 2018-12-08 20:16:44 We were however, now we produce enough oil in the USA to cover our needs.
8781 2018-12-08 20:16:42 Trump's treason was for anything that would bring him money and/or fame. He didn't choose Tillerson. Tillerson was pushed on him. That said, oil money would be a nice perk as long as he still got his 30 yr Trump Tower Moscow dream realized.
8782 2018-12-08 20:16:41 probably oil price decline, not sure...let me see if BEA has some numbers on types that go back that far for decomposition purposes.
8783 2018-12-08 20:16:35 Capitalist’s always talk about letting markets correct themselves. How come those capitalists at OPEC who don’t like the price they are getting for oil are trying to rig market for price increase?
8784 2018-12-08 20:16:34 That was the fellow whose garage it is (and who was helping me out). My gloves, first with sealant, then with oil on them, are in the bin out of shot.

8786 2018-12-08 20:16:27 If you can believe it, I’m trying to grow my hair longer, fuller and healthier.... so I’ve been researching a lot of natural ways to stimulate hair growth. Currently I’m using olive oil, lavender essential oil and unrefined organic coconut oil .... let’s see how this goes 
8787 2018-12-08 20:16:09 how much does a new oil pan for a semi cost? hopefully it is just a cracked pan and not something even more expensive.
8788 2018-12-08 20:15:53 I do not know how much oil it takes to run a wind mill.  I do know that we use oil for a lot of different products and that it is finite resource.  Using it as a fuel is a waste.
8789 2018-12-08 20:15:51 There are way too many tweets about Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

This tweet is about Extra Olive
Virgin Oil.

Now that shit is heart-healthy.
8790 2018-12-08 20:15:47 Nope its not. To do that would make jobs obsolete. Jobs in oil and gas would put over 400, 000 people out of work in Texas alone. New companies will not spend time or money to acquire these people and retrain. They will hire younger and already educated people.
8791 2018-12-08 20:15:37 Does this mean that all America's war crimes from WW2 and beyond will be revealed and punished?

Even I knew about the US plans for regime change in Syria on behalf of Genie Oil.

Will Dick Cheney finally see the inside of Guantanomo Bay. I heard that it was recently revamped.
8792 2018-12-08 20:15:28 You can save both, Jen! Place pan on stove w/lotsa salt & water. Allow to boil. Take to sink, scrub anything out. Oil up entire pan. Place in oven upside down - 200 for 3-4 hrs. Take back out, scrub again as necessary. 
Brandon, you’re welcome.

8795 2018-12-08 20:15:13 Much of the country has been telling Alberta for decades what they could do - pivot from basing your economy solely on oil. It’s killing the world. Pivot.
8796 2018-12-08 20:15:01 Irradiated and my #cbdoil is made w Palm oil
8797 2018-12-08 20:14:58 2) license and accepts tankers of Saudi oil up the St Lawrence. So AB oil is worse then Saudi oil somehow. If u think per cap doesn't matter, then u have no concept of the anger here as we watch 180,000 layoffs and still pay more than we gather back.
8798 2018-12-08 20:14:58 @glorbs_ Is taking me to a place where I’m going to be trying olive oil and vinegar on park ave. Interesting
8799 2018-12-08 20:14:56 what essential oil is that?
8800 2018-12-08 20:14:54 It's been talked about from the beginning. It's a disjointed, supposedly apolitical movement. All political parties want to pick it up but I think the far right is succeeding. It started from a real complaint now it's about a lot more than fuel oil tax or minimum wage. 1/2
8801 2018-12-08 20:14:54 The Russians are playing a losing hand and they know this. As global economics evolve the oil states will find themselves in impossible situations. One after the other. We're well past peak populism.
8802 2018-12-08 20:14:27 He was CANTANKEROUS. The last thing I said before bed was, don’t wake me up please. Lo and behold someone wants to get an oil change at 730 and then can’t decide what to wear (for the oil change) for the next hour.

8804 2018-12-08 20:14:22 People go to valvoline for an oil change and they come back with a rap sheet full of other things to get checked or repaired. Man if you just don’t change my damn oil. 
8805 2018-12-08 20:14:14 Well the stadium is sponsored by the UAE Emirates,and the owners of arsenal are russian and American oil investors,same with Chelsea,and same with man united, what now.
8806 2018-12-08 20:14:13 People are too easily trigger on stupid shit. Some knob went off on her on her IG, over a selfie she took. She had a blouse with a Native American Motif on it.

8807 2018-12-08 20:14:11 Once, while experiencing an episode of ironic humor, Zlatan Ibrahimovic drowned an elephant in a vat of peanut oil.
8808 2018-12-08 20:14:09 And if you ever go their, stop along the road go down into the ditch and pick up a handful of soil and rub it between hands and see the oil on your hands, so the Liberal environment study is not to accurate.
8809 2018-12-08 20:13:46 The tarsands oil will be mix with imported light oil. That light oil will be pumped up a secondary pipeline then used to liquefy the tarsands heavy oil. Tankers will be hauling in light oil from the middle east.
8810 2018-12-08 20:13:41 By the way @6esm, throw your glasses away...they r a petroleum product. Besides u can’t see through them anyways! Get this,nearly all consumer products r directly/indirectly related to the oil industry! You’re a dogmatic whiner w/no solutions. You’re an idealist...not a realist!
8811 2018-12-08 20:13:33 What’s this about not being “fossil” fuels but earth oil put there by Somebody, and lots of it? (Maybe heard on night radio!)
8812 2018-12-08 20:13:25 Now I know the reason why you got oil all over your face 
8813 2018-12-08 20:13:22 I think it's blacksmithing and proceeding responses try to avoid getting an oil change for the Football Robot President™
8814 2018-12-08 20:13:16 Grenlighting the XL & Dakota pipelines helped. Something rhe obama team held up for 8 years so Warren Buffett's company cd make money hauling oil by train. Very inefficient,  also very political. 

When the Alaska reserve starts pumping,  gas prices may drop more.
8815 2018-12-08 20:13:10 And we're just getting started.
Wait till oil prices go up...
8816 2018-12-08 20:13:04 yield curve, collapse in oil had to play out, erratic behavior did not help but was not the cause
8817 2018-12-08 20:13:02 Not wings but we’ve done just chicken, fries, bacon & nugget and they all come out perfectly crispy. Just needs a little bit of pam or olive oil spray and you’re good to go

8821 2018-12-08 20:12:48 @EnergyTransfer Heh Kelcy Warren- do the smart thing and give up on Balkan oil- go solar and wind.
8822 2018-12-08 20:12:41 1) Well, we'll have to agree to disagree. Per capita is the only way to look at it. Otherwise smaller provinces will always take the crap end of the stick. It is galling that Que receives $11 Bil/yr to fund $10 day care, cheap tuition etc while then saying oil has no social
8823 2018-12-08 20:12:27 Agreed, but in United’s case they’ve always been competitive. City and Chelsea were never competing at this level before oil/oligarch money.
8824 2018-12-08 20:12:23 WHO WANTS A FREE 15ML BOTTLE OF DOTERRA LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OIL?!
8825 2018-12-08 20:12:20 The people in economies based on oil care. The poor and middle class in those economies care
8826 2018-12-08 20:12:07 By your logic all oil related workers should find new jobs.
8827 2018-12-08 20:11:59 Oh no, the one where people are surprised that they don't feel too warmly about their stance on the oil industry. (The lotion is super hydrating, if you want the recommendation though. Understand if you don't want to support them)
8828 2018-12-08 20:11:57 oh, you thought this was an oil pipeline? it's for sewage, nothing to see here, move along
8829 2018-12-08 20:11:51 Prices are determined by commodity traders though production could be an influential factor, there is no consensus among the many oil producing nations to reduce their production.
8830 2018-12-08 20:11:36 If I say "I believe a car has an oil filter," that's just something that's true. So it's not a belief at all, it's merely something that's true. But if I say "I believe the Moon is made of Swiss Cheese," then I better be able to confuse myself and everyone else over the matter.
8831 2018-12-08 20:11:31 It not like this is unique, has anything to do with Alberta or Oil.. it’s cable man. People have problems with it all over the world.. lol.
8832 2018-12-08 20:11:26 There is no denying that oil is Nigeria's primary export and where they get a huge % of tax revenues. A massive % of GDP. It isnt just multinationals. This is bringing real wealth to the state and a huge move away would devastate dozens of economies like that.
8833 2018-12-08 20:11:15 We have wall decor to fit any style home or office! From oil paintings to rustic/vintage signs and architectural wall accents, New inventory everyday! What will you find? at Sarasota Salvage!
8834 2018-12-08 20:11:14 They would rather not be cutting oil production.
8835 2018-12-08 20:11:07 Keep this same energy while digging for Oil bro
8836 2018-12-08 20:11:05 That should increase the price of a barrel of oil.  So much for Trump's promise.
8837 2018-12-08 20:11:00 It trips me out that Dawn puts ducks in fake oil so they can clean them in their commercials
8838 2018-12-08 20:10:56 please explain how we will replace the BTU's produced by : Coal, Natural gas, crude oil, and shale oil.  hint: the math does not add up.
8839 2018-12-08 20:10:56 Amen, even if I don't think I've heard of net oil exporting before.
8840 2018-12-08 20:10:53 Today I taught myself how to change the oil + filter in my car & while that may be a very simple feat, I feel accomplished. 
8841 2018-12-08 20:10:52 The Bernie ones were — they wouldn’t be there soon. Hey, hey — 33,000 e-mails are missing. No, no. They took the oil.

8845 2018-12-08 20:10:41 When you have no oil it make perfect sense to demonize the commodity in an effort to minimize the effect of having non.  That’s exactly what France and Germany are trying to do.
8846 2018-12-08 20:10:24 rights to oil fields: can't speak for other African countries but we need IOCs, we either can't fund it or have the expertise for it.
If we don't want a PSC we can go the Saudi/Iranian route & have them drill in return for payment
8847 2018-12-08 20:10:12 Before we move to d #NextLevel let's assess this current level. 

*Buhari's Government has wasted about $340 million & an additional N27 billion, in search of oil in d Northern Nigeria.

*Buhari asked us to focus on northern Nigeria — World Bank

Goodluck to the Southern Nigeria
8848 2018-12-08 20:10:03 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
8849 2018-12-08 20:09:58 I lost my lip oil in a mall and I feel so bad it’s probably on the floor somewhere :(
8850 2018-12-08 20:09:55 Not the ones who died over oil and lies.
8851 2018-12-08 20:09:40 Is that the oil? I know about that took it for awhile.
8852 2018-12-08 20:09:22 Thank you! I jotted down various Seeds, Oats, Pine nuts, Thyme, Lemon zest, Paprika. Toast the dry bits and then add herb/spice. No oil/honey/wet mentioned. 
Will give it a go!
8853 2018-12-08 20:09:08 If you are serious a single word you said, resign. Otherwise, kojoa ulale!
8854 2018-12-08 20:09:07 It’s almost like he’s unaware QC has 400,000 bpd of refineries that need oil as an input
8855 2018-12-08 20:09:04 aw BOO #climatechange demonstration in #paris went SMOOTHLY on SAME DAY as follow-on #giletjaunes baby #riot ;) SPOILSPORTS

8856 2018-12-08 20:09:03 There are 9 points to process for the climat change. France's only succeed on 1 : Taxing the oil. Macron uses his plane for only 160km, Castaner his minister uses helicopter just for 60km, no one of ours ministers use electric cars...They ask things they are not doing. Hypocrisis
8857 2018-12-08 20:09:01 Putin: "I'll help you kill your dad, if you send me 40,000,000 barrels of oil!"
8858 2018-12-08 20:08:41 i have purchased collagen peptides and fish oil, hopefully this helps my hands/wrists a little
8859 2018-12-08 20:08:37 But it's OK to drop millions of tons of poutine laced shite into the St. Lawrence. If you don't want oil in Quebec, lets ban tankers filled with Venezuela and Saudi oil from entering the St. Lawrence Seaway.
8860 2018-12-08 20:08:33 Aaaand, even THIS indicator has become an "Euphoria" indicator.

#VIX , #V1X, #OIL  are all contradicting the "oh God the house is on Fire !!!" narrative. @chigrl
8861 2018-12-08 20:08:33 Winter ke aane ka yakeen tabtak nhi hota jab tak ghar ka coconut oil jumm na jaye!
@Parachute_Adv #parachutehairoil @deepikapadukone #WinterisHere #DecemberNights2018
8862 2018-12-08 20:08:31 Understandable xD We have oil which is expensive so my grandma insists on turning it on only for a few hours before bedtime. In the meantime we risk hypothermia
8863 2018-12-08 20:08:17 How much do fossil fuel subsidies to extremely profitable oil companies cost?
8864 2018-12-08 20:08:07 And Israel even more. Most wars in the ME is about oil and Israel.
8865 2018-12-08 20:08:07 Clarification: 
While It is is common to show share of each energy source in the energy pie, it is important to show this difference: 
Oil used to produce products that last for years @ decades cannot be compared to coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, for example
8866 2018-12-08 20:08:06 ok .. but the top 10 oil consuming countries account for about 58% of all that is consumed.
8867 2018-12-08 20:08:02 But you'll get that in every trade, in every sphere of life. The critical point made here is how can a person with little or no experience be  assessed and passed off as fully qualified in such a short space of time? 
Are the general public actually safe in such hands?
8868 2018-12-08 20:07:59 They aint ask me shit about my oil change i bet i dont pay they ass more than 50 omn 
8869 2018-12-08 20:07:58 You’re wasting your breath home slice. And the view on Arab oil money is absolutely looked at with a bias because it flipped the script on clubs that would otherwise not be competing at the highest level.
8870 2018-12-08 20:07:35 Would that example be to invade foreign countries for oil? How about bomb civilians and not apologize? Or wait shoot down an Iranian airline and not apologize, how about use his title as CIA director to escalate war on drugs?
8871 2018-12-08 20:07:30 Great News! 

The US just became net oil exporter for the first time in 75 years.

Can we all give President Trump an AMEN? 
8872 2018-12-08 20:07:28 What oil or butter should be used for cooking then?
8873 2018-12-08 20:07:28 Rereading the Steele Dossier today. Steele opines that Trump wanted to lift Russian sanctions for a financial stake in state-run oil firm Rosneft, facilitated by Carter Page.

Was Trump's treason for oil, not Trump Tower Moscow? His 1st SoS was an oil man (Tillerson).
8874 2018-12-08 20:07:22 Attending Flos Olei Tour 2019 in Rome at the Westin Excelsior Hotel
The excellency of Olive Oil production!
Here with Azienda Agricola Titone regione Sicilia  and Lentini Azienda Agricola Regione Puglia
8875 2018-12-08 20:07:21 Having someone to pick me up when I’m getting an oil change on my car. #singlepeopleproblems
8876 2018-12-08 20:07:18 I don’t understand how y’all can go days without drinking water. I just know y’all pee look like motor oil. 
8877 2018-12-08 20:07:13 Kojoa ulale...@ahmednasirlaw is 100 times a better lawyer than you are...and yes, more Kenyan than you can ever imagine! Hii #handshake imewaconfuse sana!
8878 2018-12-08 20:07:00 Checked there. Palm oil also gets described as over 10 different terms do ‘oil’. Very sneaky.
8879 2018-12-08 20:06:45 what the fuck? i would literally throw the oil on them-
8880 2018-12-08 20:06:32 Marg is synthetic, processed

Butter is better

But if you want something oily on your toast, since both melt anyway.... 

I pour olive oil on before the jam

I would never eat marg
8881 2018-12-08 20:06:29 Oil this time 
at least the red line ;))
8882 2018-12-08 20:06:26 my hair alternates from extremely dry to really greasy and its annoying so thats why i always have to use a shit ton of shampoo + conditioner + this oil i use to keep my hair moisturized its a hassle
8883 2018-12-08 20:06:21 Best non oil money owners
8884 2018-12-08 20:06:10 Another @JayWeatherill legacy is the criminal prosecution of @72Hallam (remember - she provided chronically ill/dying people with FREE #Cannabis oil for medical use because Jay & the various Governments refused to set up an access system).

#SAparli #auspol
8885 2018-12-08 20:06:06 @Lucas_Oil I have a Golf TDI and I just used your diesel particulate filter cleaning product that you pour directly into the tank. It worked better than I could have imagined. Great product great results
8886 2018-12-08 20:06:02 My car just got an Oil change, full tank and a wash! My definition of happiness
8887 2018-12-08 20:06:01 i mean even if the solution isnt contrary to oil or coal consumption, so much power has been invested by the coal industry in cultivating bronze age ideologies in the US that now any call for averting climate change will be opposed regardless
8888 2018-12-08 20:06:01 A small oil rich northern European country of 5 million people, surely they should be begging Britain to consume them in a union.
8889 2018-12-08 20:05:59 Need Protests to help @EmmanuelMacron! Riots So bad! USA will NOT clean our NOT DIRTY Environment for anyone! More Oil & Beautiful Clean Coal not Less! Tell them NO French Dollars! We will keep Our Fresh Clean Air over USA! Will not share with France or Paris!

#Impeach #Resist
8890 2018-12-08 20:05:59 Automative Gas Oil aka diesel.
8891 2018-12-08 20:05:55 Let's hope not. Speration and "fuck you" politics may feel good, but it's terrible in the long run. How will we get our oil yo market if we are landlocked?
8892 2018-12-08 20:05:48 Has anyone tried that CBD oil & if so does it work good for pain? I've had 5 back surgeries & always hurt. I don't like narcotic pain medicines so I take Advil & Tylenol but most days I hurt to bad 4 those meds 2 even work & I stay in bed on ice & heating pad
8893 2018-12-08 20:05:43 Quebec is selling clean Hydro energy. Not dirty oil.
8894 2018-12-08 20:05:33 That wouldn’t happen today because of all the safety features added. But you should see videos from Saudi Arabia where we are importing our oil from a f women getting stoned to death and gays being thrown from the tallest towers.
8895 2018-12-08 20:05:29 Sorry but tea tree oil is my best friend
8896 2018-12-08 20:05:26 Oil dey ur head. Leave mad pple make dem d mad
8897 2018-12-08 20:05:22 The only people who don't believe in climate change are the ultra religious right. Conservatives understand the scientific consensus but say the left / globalists exaggerate the facts to push their ideology. Macron used climate change as an excuse to raise oil taxes on the poor.
8898 2018-12-08 20:05:19 Guy at the place I'm getting my oil changed "Your car is almost perfect but you need new tires, this filter, that filter, this part and that part." Quit trying to sell me shit so I can go 
8899 2018-12-08 20:05:10 I put too much shea butter and coconut oil on my stomach  it's staining my shirt #FirstTimeMomsBeLike
8900 2018-12-08 20:05:01 My mom just got kicked out of Disneyland for her CBD oil lol
8901 2018-12-08 20:04:54 Dumbya started a war for oil after lying to the entire country. 

He’s a traitor.
8902 2018-12-08 20:04:54 Bitumen shipped by rail is not liquefied, so if a train goes over the spill is easier to clean up then a pipeline break where the Bitumen is heated and mixed with a lighter oil.
8903 2018-12-08 20:04:52 I have read several articles that say It takes more oil to make the electricity to charge an electric car than it takes to make the gas to power a conventional car the same distance
8904 2018-12-08 20:04:51 It's Canada first, not Alberta.  It's the entire economy, not oil.  It's global warming, not Conservative's ignorance. Alberta, and every state that relies so much on one resource, has always faced booms and busts, but has prospered like no other province, do they blame Trudeau?
8905 2018-12-08 20:04:44 You know your team has no followers when;
1. You end the oil money team's unbeaten run and Twitter isn't lit.
2. Your team's unbeaten run is ended by a team that was thrushed by spurs the other day and players don't feel the heat on twitter.
8906 2018-12-08 20:04:34 Went to get a oil change and they found a 10mm wrench under my hood...it found its way home.
8907 2018-12-08 20:04:31 We had never heard of it, but it was the best stuff for my eldest. He had really sensitive skin.
BTW, there's a version of it with olive oil. Blech. Do not ever get.
8908 2018-12-08 20:04:31 Oil your own mechine. Your own Presidency is shaking like hell.
8909 2018-12-08 20:04:26 If I have to hear another Christmas song I will drink motor oil
8910 2018-12-08 20:04:25 Using Canadian oil to displace foreign oil is good for both Canada and the environment, the fact federal and Quebec governments oppose use of canadian oil tells us their motive is neither environmental or for good of Canada, reality is this has same purpose as NEP
8911 2018-12-08 20:04:24 at my first natural hair salon. I feel very loved. the coconut oil, shea butter, twist out black women are unmatched.
8912 2018-12-08 20:04:10 Maazi
8913 2018-12-08 20:04:05 Those are shoes dipped in motor oil.
8914 2018-12-08 20:03:51 The EPA has a requirement that oil refiners use millions of gallons of cellulosic ethanol. One problem. It doesn’t exist. The requirement still exists. The EPA can levy fines for non compliance. The insanity of government.
8915 2018-12-08 20:03:50 Rights to oil fields, industries in francophone countries, cultural identity.
8916 2018-12-08 20:03:42 i hate coming get my oil changed by myself bc when the men ask me stuff i have no idea what they are talking about so i just say yes
8917 2018-12-08 20:03:33 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)
I could just drink it straight from the bottle!
8918 2018-12-08 20:03:33 I will be on @CTVNews at around 2pm today talking about First Ministers Conference and declining oil prices #cdnpoli
8919 2018-12-08 20:03:21 Literally: to sell oil
8920 2018-12-08 20:03:18 Reset your oil sensor on your dash.
8921 2018-12-08 20:03:02 @IcelandFoods I have been trying to avoid palm oil for a while so well done for drawing attention to this situation. All I need for Christmas now, is a rangtan to hang from my tree 
8922 2018-12-08 20:02:57 Civil wars are horrible. We should stay out of them; and never support rebels w/o knowing exactly who they are (Syria disaster, 5+, and we backed them all even ISIS types) all to cause the overthrow of the government - because of oil contracts.
8923 2018-12-08 20:02:53 Your video implied that reducing CO2 meant closing down all industry causing a massive economic shock. Wrong because the solar industry already employs more Americans that Oil, coal and gas combined. 1/2
8924 2018-12-08 20:02:42 I'm quite pleased that there is a counterpoint to the Big Green Screaming Machine on Climate Change. Would fully expect consumers and producers of oil based products to fund it. Still trying to figure out who funds activists blocking new pipelines in Canada.
8925 2018-12-08 20:02:39 Ah I missed that bit I kept giving it a blast with 3 in 1 oil whilst my mate buzzed it with the drill
8926 2018-12-08 20:02:28 I’m down two pairs of scrubs the first one got ripped on a bed at work and the second one I accidentally spilled jojoba oil all over  Luckily it wasn’t my figs !
8927 2018-12-08 20:02:19 I only ever survived MN winters by doing a layer of oil first & air drying & _then_ lotioning which at least meant not running into this specific problem. My sympathies. I can’t anything w/o my glasses either!
8928 2018-12-08 20:02:16 Nature preserves are oil reserves
8929 2018-12-08 20:02:08 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
8930 2018-12-08 20:02:04 Sounds like it is time to include renewable hydro resources in the equalization payments. Help the west in starting to get transfer payments.  Replace the NON-renewable oil that should never had been part of the equation. I’ll take $7 daycare a day, every day in Saskie.
8931 2018-12-08 20:02:03 Coconut oil and caster oil is all i use
8932 2018-12-08 20:02:02 You can use oil to slide faster
8933 2018-12-08 20:02:01 @HFI_Research Found this: World’s top oil exporter is expected to ship 7.3 million bpd in Jan, one source said...Saudi Energy Minister said that the kingdom’s oil exports would be down from around 8.3 million bpd in November.
8934 2018-12-08 20:01:51 Mehr oil
8935 2018-12-08 20:01:34 Because it’s a new business idea that has to be paid for with new business revenue which oil companies have determined is either shipping oil out of Metro Vancouver or out of the St. Lawrence by a significant increase in oil tankers and their risks.
8936 2018-12-08 20:01:30 Coconut oil might work.
8937 2018-12-08 20:01:28 Oh man, you've really sucked it up, haven't you. The oil prices are deliberately being lowered just now - which they did last time too - once they get over themselves it'll go back to normal. Reserves for years. And the opportunity to harness wind and sea in future.
8938 2018-12-08 20:01:28 Ethanol. It's the future as they said it was 100 years ago. It also takes the power away from the Arab oil producers.
8939 2018-12-08 20:01:21 Comparing the exported Bitumen to oil is like comparing wheat to a croissant. It's dumped at a low price b/c it's low quality.
8940 2018-12-08 20:01:11 It's just incredible. I get these. I get oil company ads too.
8941 2018-12-08 20:01:05 Imagine he dropped cooking oil all over our white marble kitchen tiles 
8942 2018-12-08 20:01:00 I would guess his response would be the same as mine. "Who is Jamil Smith"?
8943 2018-12-08 20:00:53 Grateful the husband took the car to get an oil change today so I can be a slob on my couch before I do some work
8944 2018-12-08 20:00:52 GO DRINK THAT CASTOR OIL!!!!
8945 2018-12-08 20:00:47 Canada, it government federally and provincially allowed and in some cases joined in on the campaign against the oil Industry and ALBERTANS/Saskatchewan’s. There is widespread lack of respect when facing ALBERTANS while standing with their hand out. Separate, we then will have
8946 2018-12-08 20:00:44 Yes! And there happens to be a store right next to it where you can pick up some coconut oil
8947 2018-12-08 20:00:40 I’m really in love with the oil it op choreo
8948 2018-12-08 20:00:23 As soon as my car tells me it’s time for an oil change, I get an oil change. Take care of y’alls vehicles and y’alls vehicles will take care of you.
8949 2018-12-08 19:59:59 Trying very hard to have a palm oil free Christmas, and it’s not easy! @ocado, more palm oil free options, please!
8950 2018-12-08 19:59:59 Mua ha ha ha....jumla news....feku went to secure supplies to Reliance refineries in the event of non availability of Iranian oil shipments....
8951 2018-12-08 19:59:56 Le passage à l'était français définit l'indépendance que marque la France par rapport à l'empire Romain.C'est la fin de la Gaule 
Le gaulois n'est pas une langue ,car à cette époque on parle soit la langue d'Oc soit la langue d'Oil bg
Donc c'est bien un rapprochement de terme
8952 2018-12-08 19:59:42 This is precisely why no one can buy into her horseshit! If she said in order to cut greenhouse gases we are going to shift oil imports to those with the best, cleanest methods of production (IE: Western ) there would probably be buy-in. But with the libs it’s divide & conquer.
8953 2018-12-08 19:59:39 Bio oil gaenak... licin (yaiyalah minyak )

Aku pake bio oil ga ngefek apa2.
8954 2018-12-08 19:59:36 Sure Poison Ivy CLAIMS to be green. But do you know how much oil it takes to mutate just one giant flytrap?
8955 2018-12-08 19:59:33 生死をさまよう精子「静止」
8956 2018-12-08 19:59:16 I.e. Venezuela will no longer sell oil.
8957 2018-12-08 19:59:09 Happens to the #OIL currently, cut just proved something is wrong.
8958 2018-12-08 19:59:05 As a Native of this land you’re hardly at the bottom. We’re doing far worse than any other group and been placed on lands that are basically hellholes until oil is discovered then we’re moved into worse than before.
8959 2018-12-08 19:58:59 We’re canceling the energy work and essential oil event that had been scheduled for tomorrow. Hope everyone has an amazing Sunday!
8960 2018-12-08 19:58:47 Because they are crooks including our hypocritical liberal government. Just because they are wrong doesn’t mean they won’t sell every last drop of oil.If it has value it will be sold.Also we need plausible green energy to replace it which we do not have yet entirely
8961 2018-12-08 19:58:45 They invested North Sea oil revenue into a sovereign wealth fund. Norway and Britain are the two sons in the biblical parable. We’re at the stage where we’re hoping for the fatted calf and forgiveness
8962 2018-12-08 19:58:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
8963 2018-12-08 19:58:31 Medicare, public tuition is INVESTING in America's greatest natural resouce. Not oil or gas or minerals: our people, our labor force, our innovators! We canT have ignorant, sick people! Cyber security isnT about weapons systems.
8964 2018-12-08 19:58:26 Oil is dark blue #chelseamancity
8965 2018-12-08 19:58:21 A break from guarding oil wells?
8966 2018-12-08 19:58:15 A fancy food selection hamper. Nibbles,biscuits, cheese, paté, cake, chocolates, nuts , fancy oil, etc etc
8967 2018-12-08 19:58:12 Tell that to the milliins of people whose jobs would become obsolete by making that move. You think green renewable energy companies will train and hire those people on the oil fields?
8968 2018-12-08 19:58:01 I believe the carbon footprint of producing Canadian tar sands oil would still be much greater than transporting foreign oil, if you’re making that argument. Plus, the push has been to get Canadian oil to other markets too. Sooooo 
8969 2018-12-08 19:57:48 @realDonaldTrump If you claim to be different from previous US presidents and you really support the people of Iran, you just have one thing to do, and that's the complete abolition of Iranian oil exports by April.
8970 2018-12-08 19:57:43 It’s fine tho, regular oil only costs $20 so yours will only be $1,789
8971 2018-12-08 19:57:42 Got my oil changed yesterday and my truck just said i need an oil change and that I’m at 5% oil life. Cool
8972 2018-12-08 19:57:34 Well no miners wouldn't by the large grow anything. But they are only 1% of the workforce. We could pay the old ones a early retirement & retrain the younger ones for industry. Hemp fiber & oil can efficantly replace most metals in autos & appliances with a composite...

8975 2018-12-08 19:57:26 Don't ya just LOVE when a jug of oil gets a crack and spills out all inside your cabinet?!  No?  ME NEITHER!!
8976 2018-12-08 19:57:25 Can confirm that @NCsmokehouse smoked rapeseed oil works wonders drizzled over a pizza.
8977 2018-12-08 19:57:04 Now India will buy oil from Iran in Rupees instead of Dollars
Russia is also being very friendly toward Iran
The $150B Obama gave to Iran is subtly shifting global power against USA, potentially to become not so subtle as USA is weakened by crushing debt & migrant overload. #MAGA
8978 2018-12-08 19:56:50 Amen nd Amen fr new birth. I need a new fresh oil. My spirituality has gone down.
8979 2018-12-08 19:56:50  not what I meant at oil .
8980 2018-12-08 19:56:44 @realDonaldTrump sanctions are worthless and the Iranian regime can continue to live up to its disgrace. You claim to seek liberation from Iran, if it is correct to complete the Iranian oil work, then they will believe all your words, but if you do not do this,
8981 2018-12-08 19:56:33 With oil prices falling watch them go boom in 12 months
8982 2018-12-08 19:56:30 There isn't a problem with oil, there is a problem with Trump. On Nov 5th, Trump let the entire worldwide oil drillers down in a huge way. OPEC is saving the drillers from Trump at this point. Terrorism funded by Iran can continue as planned now.
8983 2018-12-08 19:56:29 All that oil money and they couldn't go unbeaten... and the irony... beaten by the other financially doped dross... 
8984 2018-12-08 19:56:17 @realDonaldTrump Put all sanctions on one side, lifting sanctions on the other side. The only sanctions that will affect this regime is just the boycott of oil, a full boycott and 100% oil. Without sanctions on oil
8985 2018-12-08 19:55:53 This is the Apache oil reserve. It was Not found by the feds. I know my nephew was one of the people that found this in Texas.
8986 2018-12-08 19:55:29 That's Irving Oil, not New Brunswicker's. Ignore the provinces, just get Irving on board and they'll take care of the rest.
8987 2018-12-08 19:55:26 We need to play Oil FC every week ffs
8988 2018-12-08 19:55:16 Mr. President,   could we try energy independence? The world oil price continues to hurt the American people.  If we build refineries they are cleaner and better than anywhere on earth. Gas should only be a dollar a galon.
8989 2018-12-08 19:54:37 And what if it was another dude feeling your bicep.
8990 2018-12-08 19:54:27 Lots of omega 3 helps.   I take 2400 EPA and 1200 DHA daily per my integrated health doc.   CBD oil also.
8991 2018-12-08 19:54:22 I booked an appt for an oil change and I still have to wait an hr tf 
8992 2018-12-08 19:54:21 Immediately after Nat. Mass Choir's ministration, @PastorKAjayi will be blowing the  to the glory of God to usher in the Man of God, @PastorEAAdeboye.

This is a night of all nights. 

Get ready as we obtain the Fresh Oil tonight.

8993 2018-12-08 19:54:21 Digital snake oil. Good buy?
8994 2018-12-08 19:54:16 Standard oil got the monopoly in gasoline production and distribution. The government does not cause climate change.
8995 2018-12-08 19:54:09 Norway to Ban Deforestation-Linked Palm Oil Biofuels in Historic Vote: '... a victory for rainforests, the climate and endangered species such as orangutans that have lost their habitats due to palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia. It also sets a major precedent for…
8996 2018-12-08 19:53:59 In a video purportedly taken at #ElSharara oilfield, #Libya,  protesters say they 'halted oil/gas flow from Fezzan'. NOC has yet to issue a statement re situation +output. Nothing yet on website/twitter. Protesters warn of escalating protest if demands not addressed.
8997 2018-12-08 19:53:53 still sipping oil migo citgo
8998 2018-12-08 19:53:45 Canada needs  to  have  a  policy , if oil is  to  be  used , al least let  it  be  Canadian oil
8999 2018-12-08 19:53:41 Great interview. I have to say that after seeing that article yesterday I, and those around me felt a bit better after being beat up all year for wanting our oil moved. @JustinTrudeau should be nervous about Albertan's independence
9000 2018-12-08 19:53:39 "no social acceptability"?! Quebec is a big, cold province. How do they plan on staying warm, commuting, etc. without petroleum products? They are happily using foreign oil  and accepting equalizer payments from Alberta - hypocrites much?
9001 2018-12-08 19:53:35 twitter can you help me find the video of the pancakes and motor oil video
9002 2018-12-08 19:53:23 Depression and anxiety are real. I am a walking example. Get it gone. Prime my Body Hemp Oil. Ask me
9003 2018-12-08 19:53:01 Lastly Melanie, huge job growth in sustainable energy, jobs, money. Texas of all places, home of oil and gas, is #1 in wind energy. Bc $$$$. And when trump dumped alt energy, the NEXT day China announced plans to build more solar, they want to usurp us & be #1 in world, bc $$$$
9004 2018-12-08 19:52:52 It should have been legalized yrs ago as a holistic medicinal cure. And u do not have to smoke it now. The oil is wonderful. Side effects of chemical meds will cause many problems, side effects of Marijuana, happy hungry sleepy and no pain.
9005 2018-12-08 19:52:50 my dad prepaid 14 oil changes for my car i’m really set 
9006 2018-12-08 19:52:34 Canada is fine thanks. But maybe if the tree huggin NDP would quit holding Alberta's oil hostage that would be great. Trudeau isn't the one blocking pipelines. He's just foolish enough to buy one.
9007 2018-12-08 19:52:20 Sure except Ted wants more easy drinkers and you want more chewable beer that's darker than your engine oil
9008 2018-12-08 19:52:15 I have to get my oil changed (haven't changed it since July whoops) and I have no idea if the mechanic is available and I'm freaking out at the idea of having to call him and find out. How y'all doing?
9009 2018-12-08 19:52:10 The lefties I know advocate for electrics precisely because we need to save the oil for plastics & jet planes.
9010 2018-12-08 19:52:08 Oil, gasoline prices are way down & Quatar is leaving OPEC.
9011 2018-12-08 19:52:07 I understand the intuition. But the era has been defined by trade in physical goods. (And you have to remember, US self sufficiency in oil is a balance sheet identity, and relies on an export column.) Looking ahead you can just have a different version: intellectual free trade.
9012 2018-12-08 19:51:47 We're above a team now who are owned by an oil rich nation and are top of the league. #lfc
9013 2018-12-08 19:51:38 Weed helped my brother through Chemo. I don't smoke, so my choices are CBD oil or sit with my brother and get a contact high. 
9014 2018-12-08 19:51:31 you can get acne anywhere. Anywhere that oil builds up. or bacteria
9015 2018-12-08 19:51:28 شكراً عالدعم 
9016 2018-12-08 19:51:28 Im two doses of CBD oil in
9017 2018-12-08 19:51:22 Ah right yes. That's a good collection. My Friend Peter and Cooking Wine and Snake Oil Tanker

9019 2018-12-08 19:51:17 The oil money got the plane coughing tonight! Blood money! They deserve everything coming their way!
9020 2018-12-08 19:51:16 I’m very happy..... it’s mid December so means nothing , but it must give our boys a lift. These plastic oil barons are not perfect ..... fuck City 
9021 2018-12-08 19:50:53 You do it wrong. Make your own, sans crumbs: Deseed jalapeños, fill with flavored cream cheese, wrap in bacon, douse with olive oil and add a twig of rosemary and few pieces of garlic, bake for 30 min, enjoy better than restaurant stuff.
9022 2018-12-08 19:50:25 The oil companies employ scientists of their own, as a matter of course. Oil extraction, refining and distribution does, after all, rely on massive quantities of scientific knowledge and skills.
9023 2018-12-08 19:50:17 Blood oil? Really? I don’t even know what to say anymore. Sorry if I offended you.
9024 2018-12-08 19:50:10 I'm all for Scotland being independent, you receive more financial income from the UK then what is paid in from taxes. I'm sure you would survive but to rely heavily on the oil reserves that will not last forever is seriously foolish
9025 2018-12-08 19:50:06 I wasn't in the movie. You need to stop thinking actor's get stuck acting a sene out. Drink the pink oil moisturizer and be quiet.
9026 2018-12-08 19:50:05 Do you mean olive oil?
That's a blast from the past!
I remember Popeye! Lol.
9027 2018-12-08 19:49:52 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
9028 2018-12-08 19:49:47 Nahi iss nei use nahi kya infact iss randee ke aulaad kei peichwarrie yeh oil use huwa hei issiliyei dard sei cheeikhein nikal rehein hein
9029 2018-12-08 19:49:42 I think low oil prices do lead to that conclusion since Russians must make profits somehow.  The Question is can they stay low for 2 more years Mr President.
9030 2018-12-08 19:49:40 El Plastico Derby belongs to Russian Oil fc
9031 2018-12-08 19:49:40 Time to help out Quebec in their anti pipeline campaign and set up a blockade of any oil or gas imports into Quebec.
9032 2018-12-08 19:49:39 They say only 3% of Rivera flow, I wouldn’t trust that as far as I could throw a barrel of oil, but what they fail to say is that you can never get it back, because they don’t know how to clean it.

Thanks for coming out strong with that rebuttal!
9033 2018-12-08 19:49:37 @Tesco online shopping just gets worse every week, no appropriate sub for a loaf of white bread and olive oil! Really! 
9034 2018-12-08 19:49:29 I'm exhausted but also anxious as heck and I want to die, can I just mix hemp oil with 5 hour energy and wash it all down with Dr. Pepper?
9035 2018-12-08 19:49:21 Beard Oil: it’s everything it’s advertised to be! Ironically enough it turns out it is made of MCT Oil...
9036 2018-12-08 19:49:18 He's probably wondering if your interested in buying some oil
9037 2018-12-08 19:49:14 Damn I have to get new tires and an oil change, then I will have $0 haha. Good thing I have all this Starbucks refresher for my move tomorrow (if all goes well)  heh
9038 2018-12-08 19:49:14 I can just imagine,

'I fucking told you take Hazard and Willian out, why the fuck didn't you foul them? '

'I'm going to get tied to a chair and thrown off the Coop tower tonight by the oil men you thick dwarfs'.
9039 2018-12-08 19:49:11 really great that i bought a brand new chevy at @HessertChevy but the new owners refuse to honor my lifetime oil changes & inspections because they have a “new business model” i’m glad i now have to figure out if my warranty will be honored as well #terriblecustomerservice
9040 2018-12-08 19:49:09 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
9041 2018-12-08 19:49:08 The oil prices were same for other airlines too, isn't it ?  Owner's Lust and Exeburence killed it..
9042 2018-12-08 19:48:56 throw some cbd oil in there girl
9043 2018-12-08 19:48:45 Protip: If you're doing Pasta alla Norma, toss the eggplant with some garlic oil and roast it in the oven. While you do that you can cook down the tomato sauce on the stove. Imho much less of a hassle.
9044 2018-12-08 19:48:27 I see the hypocrisy, but I also here people here in Alberta saying we should cut off oil and gas to Quebec. I was pointing out that Quebec can find ways to live without Alberta energy.
9045 2018-12-08 19:48:23 Just that the UK found the biggest oil reserves in the entire north sea but decided to waste it all. Norway decided to save it for their people. Keep in mind that the UK is still the largest trading partner of Norway. (and Norway is not in the EU).
9046 2018-12-08 19:48:18 No because the oil industry is the #1 pollutant and we have alternatives already. Better to diversify now and prepare instead of using up a non renewable ressource and facing a second crisis.
9047 2018-12-08 19:48:10 hush child I’m speaking with olive oil here, not you
9048 2018-12-08 19:48:10 And Scottish oil kept Britain afloat in 70s 80s onwards and now...who's funding who England?
9049 2018-12-08 19:48:08 Why so many empty blue seats? Fiddling the figures for tax purposes? Money laundering dodgy oil money?
9050 2018-12-08 19:47:58 A king
9051 2018-12-08 19:47:55 honestly u boleh buat sendiri,, campurkan gula halus, madu, lemon, olive oil. It works. Since sekolah dulu dah buat, and it works! If nak tambah red food colouring pon boleh. sikiitt.
9052 2018-12-08 19:47:48 if CDN Economy is so great per Friday Stats then why do Cdn Bank stock charts  looks so sick? or why did rail stocks CP /CNR take a hit this week ? you can't have a booming economy w/sinking Baystreet. LIEberals threatening Oil sands not going to sit well  #cdnpoli @GasBuddyDan
9053 2018-12-08 19:47:35 Yes expecting a very tough game tbh. Would take draw at Anfield all day, Good luck. And for me City: Crude Oil Club buying football.
9054 2018-12-08 19:47:32 yea that's in the underground concrete building they made during the oil crisis in the 70s have fun
9055 2018-12-08 19:47:26 Don’t worry everyone I made my adult purchases for the week: oil change and contacts
9056 2018-12-08 19:47:20 It's a regressive tax, the oil companies should be the ones paying
9057 2018-12-08 19:47:15 Narrator: “Within a year, she was hustling bottle caps on the streets of New Jersey. By 14, the addiction spread to stud games on boxcar trains. At 17, she was busted running a three card monte ring in Baton Rouge. But in jail she’d discover how bread interacts with hot oil...”
9058 2018-12-08 19:47:14 Hi @Hyundai I have a question... wondering why it’s not recommended that I get a full synthetic oil change for my 2018 Hyundai Sonata. The guy didn’t really explain the reason, just gave me a hard no. Wondering if you guys can  I drive a lot soo it makes sense for me to get one
9059 2018-12-08 19:47:13 why is getting an oil change the scariest experience no matter how many years you’ve been driving
9060 2018-12-08 19:47:10 Trouble figuring out that last gift to give during the holidays. Give some CBD oil!
9061 2018-12-08 19:47:03 My  point exactly Que is one of the highest, so that  is  rewarded..... yea more taxes. It should be other way around. What is not pulled out in the article is fed royalties  and GST on oil and gas
9062 2018-12-08 19:46:59 The oil money got the plane coughing tonight! Blood money! They deserve everything coming their way!
9063 2018-12-08 19:46:55 ไม่ชอบการโดนบล็อคเพราะเหมือนการโดนเกลียด.
9064 2018-12-08 19:46:54 It says it's at 12% oil life. It's a 2015 with 80k I know nothing else about it though 
9065 2018-12-08 19:46:49 Some shameless persons are spreading a false story about this old idiot who was never 'attacked'. He concocted the story may be under influence of some 'honey' and olive oil'
9066 2018-12-08 19:46:46 no. if u look at history this movement has sprung from the wahhab and saudi allience and after they got oil they promoted their form of islam. however wahhab was opposed by pretty much all scholars his brother (scholar) wrote a refutation of him aswell - he went against islam!
9067 2018-12-08 19:46:43 I understand deep frying a bird is quick and keeps it very moist, although, I don’t know if a few glasses of port and hot oil will mix well.
9068 2018-12-08 19:46:16 Obama is the only President in history that didnt have 1 month of 3% GDP.  He hated oil, hated natural gas and coal. He prevented the keystone pipeline and restricted almost all offshore drilling. Obama has 8 years, a complete failure
9069 2018-12-08 19:46:08 How did I reach 51 years of age before learning that the brand name Esso is derived from the initials of Standard Oil?
9070 2018-12-08 19:45:58 It's kinda a blend of leather dubbin, mink oil, pit smells, and cigars.
9071 2018-12-08 19:45:57 The stupid thing about this is that oil is not a renewable ressource so basically this will just postpone a crisis that is bound to happen when the ressource runs out. Stop taking oil money and invest in training workers in renewable energy.
9072 2018-12-08 19:45:52 #PSA: Make sure to have a bath mat when using body oil in the #shower. It can get hella slippery.
9073 2018-12-08 19:45:48 @SohiAmarjeet How can you live with that fact you and your party have alienated and destroyed the oil and gas sector. Wake up and stop wasting time and tax payers money and build the pipe.
9074 2018-12-08 19:45:46 U.S. sanctions made France cut oil deal with Iran. France also imposed a tax on oil for positive "ecological" reasons but to be paid by workers, not the bourgeois elite--all within the capitalist system.
9075 2018-12-08 19:45:29 France has not enough oil.
9076 2018-12-08 19:45:22 Made applesauce, house smells incredible. Made latkes, house smells rank. May need to mull cider to exorcise the oil demons. Someone employ me soon, please.
9077 2018-12-08 19:45:11 फ्रेंड:- आपके पति *किस फ़ील्ड में* काम करतें है ?

पत्नि:- *Oil & Gas*

फ्रेंड:- वाह ... कहां पर पोस्टिंग है ?

पत्नि:- किचन में!
9078 2018-12-08 19:45:10 coconut oil stink like a mf.
9079 2018-12-08 19:45:06 I just spilled cologne oil all down my chest...
9080 2018-12-08 19:44:55 Obsessed with tea tree oil. 
9081 2018-12-08 19:44:49 I had my tragus and loved it. Try cbd oil
9082 2018-12-08 19:44:44 Today has already been so productive I love it. I went to the gym at 7 a.m., got my oil changed and now I’m about to get my nails done 
9083 2018-12-08 19:44:28 The oil money got the plane coughing tonight! Blood money! They deserve everything coming their way!
9084 2018-12-08 19:44:28 Dear @cathmckenna: Don't bend to oil industry pressure. Canada needs immediate action on climate with meaningful targets and supports for Canadians to shift to 100% clean energy now.
9085 2018-12-08 19:44:27 ตัวผมไม่ได้ดีอย่างที่คุณคิดหรอก
9086 2018-12-08 19:44:24 Looks like my driveway after an oil change in the rain

EPA who???
9087 2018-12-08 19:44:20 Keldon got fouled on that 3, but I ain’t gonna cook with that oil.
9088 2018-12-08 19:44:14 The protest is in direct correlation to the man made climate change hoax. It is for that reason, Macron wants to raise taxes on oil.
9089 2018-12-08 19:44:07 I want the same thing I had at Jersey Mike’s yesterday. A turkey sandwich withe provolone, white American, lettuce, mayo, jalapeños, vinegar, oil, salt, pepper, and spicy mustard.  it was soooo good.
9090 2018-12-08 19:44:05 1 part snake oil 3 parts bs where is fda?
9091 2018-12-08 19:44:02 Expect a new brand of snake oil.
9092 2018-12-08 19:44:01 We are quickly arriving at the point of no oil use being good for anybody except perhaps those with the finances to secure themselves against global ecological collapse... but #whatever. Keep bickering rich guy.
9093 2018-12-08 19:43:56 There is also something else rarely mentioned. A good engineer is someone who cares for the safety of the customer. Some individuals however just don't give a damn. And that has nothing to do with how they trained, or how long they trained. They're just are out to exploit people
9094 2018-12-08 19:43:55 Just in time for the worldwide oil glut!
9095 2018-12-08 19:43:54 so mcfc bench was very poor when they needed to make a change to chase the game. even after all the barrels of oil they've shipped it's clear a few injuries has them digging for more..
9096 2018-12-08 19:43:51 A lack of on site refining is the problem. Why sell our oil for pennies when we could use our own?
9097 2018-12-08 19:43:48 My friend wanted to throw away one of those large fin oil heaters as it is inefficient & too expensive, but his gardener wanted it. "But you can't afford to run it" my friend said. No, said the gardener, we get free electricity with a connection
9098 2018-12-08 19:43:45 Frank & Myrrh? Spikenard? Olive Oil (with or without any number of herbs infused)?
9099 2018-12-08 19:43:35 Wow I got a juniper latte at starbucks and this is the first time I've ever had a latte that can only be described as tasting like those diffuser stick that you stick in oil so your living room smells better and not like stale pizza
9100 2018-12-08 19:43:34 Hmm, don’t know what happened to those. How did they taste? Because, that’s all that matters. Did you use shortening, or oil?  You can’t substitute.
9101 2018-12-08 19:43:24 But the farm bill is supposed to pass legalizing the production of hemp in US It has hardly no thc & can produce cbd oil. Will b interesting
9102 2018-12-08 19:43:23 Switching to aluminium-free deodorant has been the best thing I've done this month. Rasasi have a new organic deo with salicylic acid & castor oil. No more irritated skin.

Aluminium= irritated skin= discolored underarms.
9103 2018-12-08 19:43:17 Tar sands operations use at least three times as much freshwater per barrel of oil as conventional oil operations. 11 million litres of toxic waste from the tar sands leak into Athabasca River and watershed daily.
9104 2018-12-08 19:43:07 Brexit, Trump election, trade tensions, Merkel announcing retirement, Macron's troubles, arrest of Huawei CEO, US self-sufficiency in oil--maybe coincidence but the confluence suggests end of globalization era. Cant put humpty dumpty back together.
9105 2018-12-08 19:43:03 #whatcanadaloses if youre fighting the pipeline, youre supporting the import of oil from countries with worse environmental regulations and higher emissions. You are also supporting American lobbyists intent on diverting attention away from their polluting industries. Good job!
9106 2018-12-08 19:42:57 Androids unfortunately do not zoom in far away well without making it look like an oil painting , otherwise I love the xameras on them uwu
9107 2018-12-08 19:42:56 yeah we all do but you don’t see me, ilham, or any other yemeni getting on social media everyday excited about blood oil. just say you’re a saudi admirer with your chest and move on
9108 2018-12-08 19:42:30 So why is it all these calls are made only when the west feels its comfortable. Melting glaciers didn't begin yesterday. Why are African countries making pledges that are non-commensurate with our level of industrial devt? Oil exploration etc are still in full gear by Shell etc
9109 2018-12-08 19:42:28 Please sweat, I need your oil
9110 2018-12-08 19:42:23 How to tame a dragon. Oil on canvas. 40 x 40 cm. For sale.
9111 2018-12-08 19:42:14 This is gonna sound weird BUT try CBD oil treats. They’re good for dogs and help calm them down
9112 2018-12-08 19:42:14 The constant on negative press coverage of this administration is not helping ordinary Americans,who live from pay check to pay&who benefit from wisdom in Trump's foreign policy position,particularity on oil.

9116 2018-12-08 19:41:57 What do you have to say about Beto voting to lift the ban on exporting oil? Is that a BS smear too?

9119 2018-12-08 19:41:45 Why the hostility? Yes. The GOP has been suckling off the tits of Big Business for yrs, but I’m saying the Dems haven’t worked hard for workers, which led to ppl abandoning them & being sucked in by a snake oil salesman. Throw in opportunists to play on WP fears, perfect storm.

9127 2018-12-08 19:40:41 @digitalassetbuy kids will be so rich maybe they will allow your kids to change the oil in their cars. How can you hate on a man who uses sports to teach his kids that hard work and persistence pays off? It’s a shame you had to comment such negativity on this legends page.

9169 2018-12-08 19:36:46 @efrances26  Hashbrowns can be so difficult but so yumsters when cooked right. I find that you need to let them be so they can attain their greatness: heat oil with some butter & add hashbrowns (med high heat) Leave them alone for 15 mins then turn over & cook for 15 mins more.
9170 2018-12-08 19:36:42 I can link you to a recipe that looks like it would be similar based on the ingredients. They’re a shelf stable version of butter mints that use palm kernel & palm oil, ingredients also used in fake white chocolate.
9171 2018-12-08 19:36:37 We should all thank George Mitchell, the oilman who combined the techniques of hydraulic fracturing with horizontal drilling to 'crack' hard rock and release the oil and gas held tightly. A modern marvel of science and engineering skills. Thanks, George!

9199 2018-12-08 19:33:55 Is that any different from BP or shell having 100million to be able to drill for oil. For me we should levy the industry at say 1% to pay for science and management.

9212 2018-12-08 19:32:32 So then the problem isn't the healthcare, it's the subsidies for war and oil and the corruption of our system that eats up most of our revenue that is the problem?

9249 2018-12-08 19:29:38 I HATE the “oil money” clap at City. It’s extremely racist. It says “all other money is okay, but not those Arabs with oil money.”
 
Don’t use that. Be better.

9251 2018-12-08 19:29:33 Bio oil definitely helps (Mum to twins so - I get you!).  They will fade in time if you don’t put the weight back on.  Bleeding is not good.  Keep the area clean and as dry as possible and use an antiseptic cream - if it doesn’t improve go see your doctor. Hope that helps 
9252 2018-12-08 19:29:31 @EvanShanks I bought a wrecked Z and I'm in the process of getting it on the road and it runs fine it just needs body work and some suspension pieces but your videos have me so paranoid now. I'm having oil pressure nightmares.

9261 2018-12-08 19:28:31 ok, day 2 of Paula's Choice moisture renewal oil on the face. In California, with super dry air and skin that tends towards the dry side as I've gotten older. My face REALLY soaks this stuff in. Thanks @dbsmasher for the recommendation to try this out.
9262 2018-12-08 19:28:30 Excellent advice. You can find studies on frankincense on PubMed. Choose your brand with caution as there are 4 different grades of essential oil and you need 100% pure therapeutic grade. Some are adulterated and essentially useless. 
9263 2018-12-08 19:28:26 The lower spot price for heavy oil (aka bitumen, oil sands, tar sands) is sometimes measured via the discount between WCS and WTI. There will always be some discount reflecting different oil qualities and transportation between AB and TX, but this "natural discount" is about $15

9268 2018-12-08 19:28:10 City fans are genuine bandwagon fans. They even slate there own players for not performing well. Money has spoiled them. Joke of a club. As good as they are, oil money has been source of there revolution. Shame.
9269 2018-12-08 19:28:06 And importing the same quantity of oil for Middle East stops what emissions exactly?  I'll wait.

9272 2018-12-08 19:27:59 No one wants to sell AB oil to QC and ON. They want to get it out to export.
9273 2018-12-08 19:27:55 I know United fans don't like admitting it, but I will have Liverpool win the league every year if it meant City missing out. Our fiercest rivals, but a proper club nonetheless. Watching this kerosene derby reminds us what football has become; 2 nothing clubs with some oil #mufc
9274 2018-12-08 19:27:51 I've put Gingerbread scented oil in the oil burner. It smells AMAZING in here.

9282 2018-12-08 19:26:47 i wah rub down oomf in coconut oil then put her to sleep
9283 2018-12-08 19:26:43 Told you. Hold this L you oil merchants
9284 2018-12-08 19:26:40 Ah thank you so much!!!! I use nothing but organic coconut oil on my skin 
9285 2018-12-08 19:26:38 Lower oil prices are good for refiners and midstream energy companies. Lower input cost increase demand for  refined products increases, thereby  boosting refining margins. Now is a good time to buy the dip
9286 2018-12-08 19:26:34 They love  it because they are destroying the oil industry they are fucking lunatics that have to be voted out next October.

9291 2018-12-08 19:26:24 This is a “manufactured crisis” that was invented to hard sell the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. 
You’re producing and shipping as much oil as you ever have. The difference is with the price you’re getting. Selling more to China and burning more, wont help.
9292 2018-12-08 19:26:23 Oil billions still can’t buy it.

9297 2018-12-08 19:25:45 Pumping more non renewable resource while continuing to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize a profitable private oil industry that is already wildly under-regulated sounds more like modern China than US imho, hope the gallon price at least gets under $3.50/gal for the effort
9298 2018-12-08 19:25:38 Anoint yourself with oil every morning.

9302 2018-12-08 19:25:21 Dear lord, so tired of Trudeau, Quebec & the mayor of Montreal running this country (mayor does not want eastern pipeline).  An eastern pipeline would also get more western oil to New Brunswick - that would help get us off Saudi imports.
9303 2018-12-08 19:25:17 Build the pipeline until Ontario, and then Quebec can feel good about importing Saudi Oil and financing wars in the middle east. 
In addition, it is time for Western Canada to opt out of the Canadian Unemployment plan and start our own. Too much money gets sent east.

9321 2018-12-08 19:24:02 The chart I posted, which is oil's *share* of total global energy consumption from all sources, would not be helpful in any way to explain the increase in 2018 emissions, recently reported.
9322 2018-12-08 19:24:00 My parents are from South Dakota so that skewed some of my answers, but Picayune, that precious coin in the Old South's Purse, left it's tung nut oil stain on my talkin and my soul. And happy for it. Can do without all the GD racists and homophobes though.
9323 2018-12-08 19:24:00 The USA was the power that supplied the rest. The USSR would’ve collapsed without lend lease due to lack of oil, trucks, and sheets of steel they build most of their tanks with. It’s not all about fighting during warfare.
9324 2018-12-08 19:23:59 I don’t think people in SK and MB are that foolish. We don’t listened to people like Jason Kenney & Charles Adler. AB is doing well under the NDP. You have to remember oil is a boom & bust business and you just have to ride it out. Separating from Canada changes nothing.
9325 2018-12-08 19:23:58 We've already had two cat-scares this year, the 'oil episode' and then the poison. The local vets' out of hours service is totally inadequate and also ridiculously expensive.

9327 2018-12-08 19:23:48 The fact that Manchester City, even with all the oil money they have spent, can’t go the season unbeaten
9328 2018-12-08 19:23:47 Quebec is okay with oil - as long as it comes from Saudi Arabia.
9329 2018-12-08 19:23:32 I call to my aid the powers of colloidal silver, oil of oregano (the Greek stuff is my preferred), and zinc.  Plus to help in with aches and pain in the body a mineral soak is nice, which I use magnesium and epsom salts in a very hot bath. I chew on feverfew leaves for headaches.

9337 2018-12-08 19:23:00 Commentator just said it's great to see 7 English players now on the pitch.

Fuck me, there's 22 players on that pitch, under 1/3rd are English and 1 academy player from each side as a late sub. 

Oil money vs Russian money
9338 2018-12-08 19:22:51 Girlll . You know BM and holding them accountable for anything are like oil and water.
9339 2018-12-08 19:22:50 I'm a man city fan and i admit that we are A JOKE OF A CLUB, we need more oil money to win against chelshit what a joke we have no history too
9340 2018-12-08 19:22:41 This is a weak elitist obfuscationary tactic that’s obvious to anyone with critical thinking skills. Carbon taxes are a tax on the poor; France still gives billions in subsidies to oil, need I expand? Neoliberalism is the problem, not Russia
9341 2018-12-08 19:22:34 Before or after the oil money ?
9342 2018-12-08 19:22:28 Oil
9343 2018-12-08 19:22:26 So I am reading that 2018 saw an increase of 2.7% in emissions ? I know this is Oil in your chart but maybe 2018 will show slightly higher use of oil or could more production of Lithium Ion batteries be a culprit for the increased emissions?
9344 2018-12-08 19:22:11 Hopefully one of them will be able to cap the well leaking oil off LA since 2004
9345 2018-12-08 19:22:08 You would rather see a no deal and the country in term oil on the worlds markets you were elected to represent your constituents and the majority 65k voted leave so grow a pair and vote against @jeremycorbyn
9346 2018-12-08 19:21:57 Most of the companies that ought to employ us already have their own slots so all the recruitment processes is just famzing... imagine as a chemical engineer.. you can’t do NYSC in all those oil firms cos they won’t accept you...then where do you get the experience from 
9347 2018-12-08 19:21:56 But before that happens, I might just try and make another batch of coconut oil.

9353 2018-12-08 19:20:57 bright future outlook: we are roughly 6 doublings of solar installations away from ability to power earth entirely from solar energy... at current rate ~2030, coal/oil advocates notwithstanding. AI, clean almost free energy, vertical farming will bring abundance

9360 2018-12-08 19:20:22 Why must getting an oil change always be so damn difficult. I swear I need to learn how to do this myself
9361 2018-12-08 19:20:19 Would also add: when OPEC is either cutting or needs to cut, it confirms the oil market has entered a bearish phase, and the cuts, counterintuitively, won't solve the problem. Conversely, when OPEC has to increase production, it signals the bullish phase.

9371 2018-12-08 19:19:43 Would love to stick it back to Saudi Arabia and the other inbred OPEC countries after what they did to us in 1967 and 1973.  Let them defend themselves against the next tyrant after their oil dries up.

9373 2018-12-08 19:19:37 I need to find me an oil field king so he can pay off my student loans. Fuck a house. Relieve me of my debt so I know it’s real. 
9374 2018-12-08 19:19:35 I also disagree that we'll be poorer. Oil companies make insane money and cry every time they are asked to do things the right way and automakers can make cars more fuel efficient. The fact that those companies want to pass all costs to consumers speaks to them, not the govt.

9385 2018-12-08 19:18:32 #WhatCanadaLoses is the competitive advantage that would allow us to combat climate change effectively. We have to get off oil. So creating the most value for the oil that is currently extracted is paramount and will provide the capital to transition efficiently as possible. IMO

We are, after all, Energy Independent ... and in time could even help Europe out more so they aren’t so dependent on Russia/SA/OPEC . BIG IF ...
9390 2018-12-08 19:18:01 Are you high? The US had no care to enter WW2 as long as Ford, General Motors, standard oil, BBH and others were profiting from the nazi regime. Pearl Harbor left you no choice publicly. Oh, and NATO also exists to protect the US not just Europe. Imbecile

9392 2018-12-08 19:17:49 the surge was yesterday morning,  because russia announced deals with OPEC.    The reason oil is at the low range of profitability for oil companies is because america opened up oil fields, and is pumping more oil than ever.

9394 2018-12-08 19:17:18 Should any reasonable person care if an oil well is retired before it is “economic” to switch to solar? Rex Tillerson has all the money he needs and we could give money to the people who work the well and the refinery.

9409 2018-12-08 19:15:18 arising from it are all problems due to the non-economic nature of the 'dependence'. In fact, with oil, it's a problem of politically distorted supply *and* demand, which is both a cause and effect of governments' manipulation of this market.
9410 2018-12-08 19:15:03 I thought the $100B referred to the amount the oil sands brings into the economy (or government coffers?)

9429 2018-12-08 19:13:25 Lol. If they separate (which they won’t) they’ll have an even harder time trying to get their oil products to tidewater. It’s a surefire way to not sink their economy but completely obliterate it.

9516 2018-12-08 19:05:06 Lets look at the Saudies behavior under Obama when Obama was fighting with Russia to get us some good oil prices and now that Trump is fighting Russia and their cronies in the region Assad and Iran while asking them to do the same exact thing.  Is this going to be it hard to see?
9517 2018-12-08 19:04:56 Typically soy sauce, sesame oil, acid (rice wine vinegar/lime juice), green onions, maybe a touch of garlic and spice. Works on soba, rice, mung bean, sweet potato noodles. Issa yummy and quick meal.
9518 2018-12-08 19:04:50 My ideology was born of the Louisiana floods in 1927 and Standard Oil's unacceptable practices through Louisiana. I stand on the side of the PEOPLE. Let no corporation, no organization, and no conglomerate question that. Our people are NOT a commodity!
9519 2018-12-08 19:04:42 Oil prices need to remain stable and stay down. Only sold by the value of it and the services used to obtain it. Otherwise, we will have to start pouring alcohol into our gas tanks and watch our cars cough and stall everyday on the road. We need good oil.
9520 2018-12-08 19:04:28 And that's going to hurt the NDP in the next election. 

This bending over backwards for the oil industry play is alienating to actual progressives. And a lot us may stay home. Which isn't good, but it's what always happens when the lefty parties move to the right.
9521 2018-12-08 19:04:26 It makes me sad that my dog will never know joys of Nutella. I know it has palm oil in, and that’s bad, but it’s just sooo good.

9525 2018-12-08 19:04:08 Can somebody's daughter please spoil me this Christmas with an oil painting of Whoopi Goldberg
9526 2018-12-08 19:04:06 This happens everytime oil goes down. In my 50 years I've heard this over and over. The hardships during bust times are mainly the fault of Alberta governments, all of them, who fail to save and invest during boom times.
9527 2018-12-08 19:04:01 the making of Ligurian focaccia - bathing the dough in olive oil and pressing into it - is the sexiest thing I’ve watched on Netflix #saltfatacidheat
9528 2018-12-08 19:03:55 Boots, 2 for 1 on baby oil
9529 2018-12-08 19:03:39 I would think the oil companies might be complaining...
9530 2018-12-08 19:03:29 Eh, youre aware that it was originally used by both genders until some fuckheads decided that the men were just making fun of them. But seriously, if you want it to stop you are pro-”fundamental, original purpose of MeToo”.
9531 2018-12-08 19:03:24 Slurp slurp (also I didn't even realize people still used oil menorahs outside of synagogues)
9532 2018-12-08 19:03:18 can these girls not been rescued in this day of drones and so many hitech weaponry in an oil rich nation such as Nigeria? What is the real reason boko haram is thriving?

9534 2018-12-08 19:03:03 But they must remove all the terrorist traps. The Yemeni war will also have much greater costs. There are those who have invested in it wanting more oil props, but it will cost more as in even Israeli lives.
9535 2018-12-08 19:02:55 Lmaoooooooooooo enjoy those oil change waits lmaoooo
9536 2018-12-08 19:02:50 The world is a funny place.. If the government finds diamonds or oil in your backyard, it’s government property. But if they find drugs.. it’s yours. Smfh. Lame.
9537 2018-12-08 19:02:50 Turmeric is the answer. Fish oil is for suckers!
9538 2018-12-08 19:02:42 No unfortunately. I need to make it instead cause every time I have bought it, its either 90% oil or 90% basil and basil doesnt taste great on its own imo
9539 2018-12-08 19:02:34 She’s right.  Look how we blew the North Sea oil money.  Look how they looked after theirs.  #dancelikeanorwegian
9540 2018-12-08 19:02:28 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
9541 2018-12-08 19:02:25 I think it’s okay to have him up for a bit... more of a tell who the Oiler’s think will help them win games. But send him back down if he’s sitting/not playing much.
9542 2018-12-08 19:02:24 Trump has literally been poaching Putin’s clients since he first took office.

The US is now the #1 exporter of oil in the world, and oh yeah.. $700 billion for our military.

NATO funds anybody?? 

Trump calls out Merkel for dependency on Russian oil..

Over and over and over.
9543 2018-12-08 19:02:20 Ever since China launched the yuan oil contracts payable in gold, we are in an asset backed world.  If we do not go back to gold standard we will be decimated. So the question is when do we revert back?
9544 2018-12-08 19:02:15 Bof... Cette marée jaune est un raz le bol général. Une goutte de gaz oil a fait déborder la bassine. Les parlementaires pourraient être un peu moins avantagés, des gens font un boulot autrement plus dur qu'eux. En plus ces histoires d'emplois familiaux me debecte injustice tjrs
9545 2018-12-08 19:02:14 Just started using beard oil this week, now it’s over for you basic beard bitches 
9546 2018-12-08 19:02:06 Castor oil, coconut oil and Cantu SAVED MY CURLS.
9547 2018-12-08 19:02:04 Then, please tell me why there is a need to purchase foreign oil and not purchase Western Canada Oil.  There is and will be a need for oil for many more years. Just look around and see how dependent we are and will be on this resource for a long time to come.
9548 2018-12-08 19:01:54 They yummy fried with olive oil spray in roll with lots of mixed salad and mayo scrape.
9549 2018-12-08 19:01:54 Especially if you boil them in oil.
9550 2018-12-08 19:01:31 For natural lash growth or for lash extension removal? Because oil breaks the glue bond

9553 2018-12-08 19:01:25 Totally agree. However benefits? satiety in small amounts (non dairy n/sat fat added to a protein?). For those folks who have GI issues with sat/dairy and non dairy sources.. ( coconut oil etc...). Currently PB Fit has added sugar to it.. but minus fat.
9554 2018-12-08 19:01:25 I just gave myself a gnarly oil burn, and I tell you what, it was mighty unpleasant.
9555 2018-12-08 19:01:23 It needs to be investigated nevertheless. Maybe it was the intel guys who sold you tampared potatoes or oil, or messed with your stove. 
9556 2018-12-08 19:01:22 And also, production for certain oils that vegans use, like palm oil for example, decimates environments that are key for certain species, orangutans being one.
9557 2018-12-08 19:01:20 americans be like: this is deep fried guacamole but bc its avocado and avocado is a vege then its healthy even though it’s dipped in ten gallons of oil,,, healthy
9558 2018-12-08 19:01:12 If you really against building pipelines and the oil field I should take ya car away and your whole ass furnace too.
9559 2018-12-08 19:01:08 Facts say otherwise. Oil-yuan futures captured ~14% of oil futures in its first month, and now is about on par with WTI in trade volume. So, Petroyuan is wildly successful, and probably even exceeded the Emperor Xi's expectations. Team Trump should focus on killing the Petroyuan!
9560 2018-12-08 19:01:06 Goes to show ya, the squeaky, obnoxious, lying wheel always gets the oil. #FoxNews is a parasite on our country.

9573 2018-12-08 19:00:15 There are many laws that prevent snake oil salesmen, just like the legal issues @kenthovind got into by selling vitamins and bitter seeds as cancer treatment.
9574 2018-12-08 18:59:57 Why do we continue to rely on fossil fuel discoveries and not focusing on renewables tech and increased consumer availability? You and your colleagues refuse to think outside the oil and gas bribes. 2018 $19M from oil & gas to GOP. You and Ted received $1M of that.

9585 2018-12-08 18:58:49 Dems jumped all over him saying he went to war over oil. And doesn't care about the common man. But all of a sudden after he passes u love him. Hypocrite

9604 2018-12-08 18:57:04 They blame everyone but themselves and in that they are projecting their own faults. Who spent like drunken sailors when oil was $100/barrel? She was part of the PCs who was also embroiled in Redford's scandal.
9605 2018-12-08 18:57:01 I really hope people aren’t throwing water in oil to check if it’s hot. I really, really hope not.
9606 2018-12-08 18:56:48 To have shiny and luscious hair, Argon oil. To seal in moisture, you need a heavy sealant oil. To maintain the curl pattern you need a heavy cream to set the pattern. Moisture is key and that’s via products or just water. But water isn’t enough.
9607 2018-12-08 18:56:44 Now would be a really good time for all of us to cut back on gas consumption as much as is humanly possible. Let them keep their damned oil.

9615 2018-12-08 18:56:19 Did you know that oil demand will rise by 12% over the next 22 years? Where do you want to get your oil from? Canada, an enviro and green tech / innovation leader or OPEC where there's little regard for human rights or environ? Fair question.

9625 2018-12-08 18:55:32 Why did it happen under Obama Jennifer? Whataboutism aside. It was to curtail fracking and oil drilling in the Arctic which opens up a whole host of problems & possibilities relating directly and indirectly concerning the environment. You won't learn that on faux news
9626 2018-12-08 18:55:21 Nope, it was just the oil when I put my fries in them.
9627 2018-12-08 18:55:09 While my car gets an oil change, I scoured the lobby for an outlet to charge my phone only to realize after finding one that I can’t listen to music at the same time because of this stupid dongle business from Apple. RIP Me. Send help. I’m dying from boredom.

9631 2018-12-08 18:54:56 I don’t mind the taste of the olive oil and I bought some for myself to test out. The month that I tried it was great. Haven’t bought anymore since then as I was looking into making some myself.

9635 2018-12-08 18:54:48 How can you retweet this partisan garbage? Kennedy Glans was a member of the PCs who spent like drunken sailors when oil was $100/bbl. They left Albertans with no savings, or future plan, and did nothing to diversify or prepare for the next bust , ignoring Lougheed's advice.

9638 2018-12-08 18:54:31 Before bed, every night, massage it into your eyelashes by rubbing them between your fingers. Another option is to dip a disposable mascara brush in olive oil and brush it through your lashes. Careful you don't soak the brush too much, or it might end up in your eyes. Be patient.
9639 2018-12-08 18:54:27 OK Mr. President, Just a simple question, Let's assume he was like how you described, WHY YOU PICKED HIM AS A FOREIGN MINISTER? He ran one the biggest oil company in the world, to me, that is well enough to believe him as a smart man.

9645 2018-12-08 18:53:28 The fact that "free market economy" hasn't turned the opportunity of moving off carbon energy into huge piles of money only goes further to reveal that it's at best banana oil. At worst, hokum.

9653 2018-12-08 18:52:41 Sometimes olive oil is a bit too much on the digestion and liver. There are companies that use avocado, coconut or sunflower oil as the taste is better and for some easier to digest. These options are a bit more expensive though.

9655 2018-12-08 18:52:35 the LF GF pizza base dough is what I <3 the most — but doesn't actually use a bread maker, just a bowl, flours, LF milk, olive oil (can highly recommend, though it is hard to find in UK, buckwheat flour… easy to find in the shop at the end of the road here, though, if you want?)
9656 2018-12-08 18:52:33 わかる
9657 2018-12-08 18:52:21 Well you'll need the LNG (a byproduct of oil production) to create that Electricity you crave as windmills and solar panels will never produce enough of what you crave.

9659 2018-12-08 18:51:27 If you truly cared about Carbon Dioxide emissions you would not have let Quebec build a concrete plant that creates more emissions then all the oil sands combined... oh wait... this is just you dividing the country apart east vs west.. be honest for once in your life
9660 2018-12-08 18:51:25 Im proud to be part of the most technologically advanced &  environmentally responsible oil & gas industry on the planet.

9663 2018-12-08 18:51:00 I don’t understand it at all. What a ridiculous boycott. And my livelihood depends on oil. I will buy more from Lush now.
9664 2018-12-08 18:50:58 ....I tried the CBD oil one time, maybe I needed a stronger dose, but i did not get significant pain relief, but if others do, that is wonderful. Though being a regular pot smoker may not be a good idea, it should be each person's decision, not the Govt's. Legalize it and be done

9673 2018-12-08 18:50:19 That’d be quite the accomplishment Brian. The energy independence is directly related to vastly improved oil exploration and extraction along with a president making certain the emphasis represents a self sufficient energy policy. Natural gas has also come to the forefront.
9674 2018-12-08 18:50:17 Why are @Valvoline oil changes $100? Not even my dealership rips me off that bad.

9677 2018-12-08 18:49:37 Klein facilitated the economic environment that saw substantial investment in the Oil Sands that saw Alberta become the economic engine of the country. If you wish to stick your head up your butt and deny the truth that's your prerogative. Food banks are overwhelmed.
9678 2018-12-08 18:49:32 Your looking to sell more oil, to make up for the difference in the low price you’re getting. You’re still getting the same low prices from China that the US is paying, so you’re really just pumping more emissions into the atmosphere just to protect your revenues..not your price.
9679 2018-12-08 18:49:19 Stand w/ Friends of the Earth. Big Oil & Agriculture lobby 2 expand fossil fuel infrastructure & gut environmental protection!

9683 2018-12-08 18:48:41 Russia’s economy is the same as Italy’s. Some great power. Russia is broke between Putin’s stolen billions taken out of their treasury and the sanctions. They are desperate to sell their oil.
9684 2018-12-08 18:48:40 you should take collagen peptides and fish oil. it helped me alot
9685 2018-12-08 18:48:40 Pretty sure he cares about the Saudis helping Trump Inc make a buck, and doesn’t give a damn about oil prices.
9686 2018-12-08 18:48:36 Sure. But if oil trade is controlled down to the level of plutonium, capitalism can roll on.

9688 2018-12-08 18:48:28 And there’s just been another deal struck to send US-produced oil out of the country.
9689 2018-12-08 18:48:08 There's a lot of reasons, for example atm the largest source of hydrogen is through fossil fuel  vai oil refining due to steam reforming from hydrocarbons.
In 1999 this accounted for ~95% of hydrogen production while electrolysis accounted for ~4%.

9692 2018-12-08 18:47:29 The notion is ridiculous....Alberta would be sucked up by the US in about 5 seconds and with only oil to offer as a developed industry not even so sure it would get state status.
9693 2018-12-08 18:47:23 How is encouraging eastern provinces to re-allocate where they get their oil from to cause a pipeline to the east not positive action?

9705 2018-12-08 18:45:50 Costs of petrolium skyrocket as Venezuelan oil refiners, #2 in the world behind USA, light aflame. STA reporters dodge gunfire as they record the events of the rebellion in Venezula, and the only light in the cities is provided by the flames of oil fires seen as far as Jamaica.
9706 2018-12-08 18:45:50 Like making almost any baked food requires your hands lmao. When I bake chicken I pull the skin back and rub oil into the meat with my hands, is that gross? 
9707 2018-12-08 18:45:43 some textiles need oil. machines will still need some oil. I believe they have other minerals too. What bothers me is this all represents industrialization, and i think a lot of them have resisted that for good reason. Their lifestyle might become obsolete

I was referring to the vast majority of our goods being made from/with petrochemicals. I know we have alternative energy sources, but manufacturing of consumer goods needs oil.

9717 2018-12-08 18:45:12 Globalist attempting to gain control of the world's energy sector, through farce known as "global warming.
Buying oil at <$50 a barrel, then selling gas at >$5 per gallon is quite profitable for progressive globalists, yet very damning for the world's poor.

9718 2018-12-08 18:44:54 Still occurred. Undermining the whole concept of the accord. Especially since Asian countries and Germany INCREASED their emissions. Btw under Obama more fracking and oil drilling occurred as well.
9719 2018-12-08 18:44:50 Doubling down on oil with existing overly generous subsidies, low royalties, and new subsidies every other week, and gifts of pipelines and rail cars..... is not progressive.

My idea is to hand over nuclear industry to the next generation so they will have something other than a solar a panel for when oil runs out.
9728 2018-12-08 18:43:55 If they truly want to leave then go. With the surplus oil in the world and the downward price, I don't think the eastern bastards will freeze. Negotiations  would be real interesting as Alberta was created by Canada, who says they get to leave with borders as they are now.

9741 2018-12-08 18:42:10 True. And the microscopic cuts these tools make happen also breed bacteria. Like the beautiful soul @LaBeautyologist stated, use yr fingertips. Scrubbing such as these tools do can actually produce more oil.
9742 2018-12-08 18:42:06 But look, that oil corporation is tens of thousands of people, and billions of dollars of infrastructure, and many centuries of experience, much of it relevant to rebuilding a reasonably workable future. 

You may wish it were otherwise. But it isn't.
9743 2018-12-08 18:41:56 It seems to me there was a party in Alberta that was screaming "TURN OFF THE TAPS". I won't name them but the hint is their name starts with a U and ends with a P. All of a sudden they realize that it's refineries that buy oil, and not the Canadian Government.

9754 2018-12-08 18:40:31 Congratulations.  Sounds like a windfall for Texas, if you could square this with not undermining climate change mitigation.  Have an idea or a plan?  Maybe for each $1, of oil extracted, you spend a dollar on solar trees, or water projects.

9767 2018-12-08 18:39:12 Because the organizers are not getting paid by Saudi oil or by concerning parties of polluted waters.
9768 2018-12-08 18:39:02 Took you until 1941 to join in and help. In the meantime you were selling oil to the Germans....fact!!
9769 2018-12-08 18:38:56 I think Canada  still producing about 4 million. However, A few years back the Economist predicted Russian default on its foreign debt. That never happened because Putin started pumping oil like crazy and making pipeline deals to get to market. Our environmentalist helping Putin
9770 2018-12-08 18:38:54 This is a resource assessment, ie : potential undiscovered reserves.. a lot has to fall in line for that potential resource to become reserves that can be produced economically... the oil industry is good at drilling the low hanging fruit first.
9771 2018-12-08 18:38:50 @cathmckenna Do you really believe that the world is better off using foreign oil than Canadian oil?

9786 2018-12-08 18:37:44 Palm oil is mostly on the other side of the world where orangutans live. Whole other rainforest and vegans tend to stay away from palm oil or get it from sustainable sources not cutting down rainforest
9787 2018-12-08 18:37:31 ... So there goes the business/oil support. On top of the military support. He's left now with racists, criminals, and evangelicals.

9790 2018-12-08 18:36:59 Didn't you hear? It's totally innocuous for super wealthy oil executives to contribute a couple thousand dollars to your campaign because those contributions come from individuals rather than directly from an oil company.
9791 2018-12-08 18:36:51 あﾞ？なんでだよ っていちろ~に詰め寄るやつ
9792 2018-12-08 18:36:48 The point you're missing is that we don't want more oil than we're already producing. #bcpoli
9793 2018-12-08 18:36:48 For the province, for the oil industry? I can't think of a damned thing. Disaster relief after floods, but there is a standard formula, so it's baked in.

9795 2018-12-08 18:36:42 The Paris agreement has nothing to do with their protests it's the rise in oil and gas that they are protesting.

On the other hand I am protesting your idiocracy..... You are too stupid for words
9796 2018-12-08 18:36:22 John Kelly: another person who sacrificed his reputation to abet a snake oil salesman. Who will be the @DorisKGoodwin of the future who writes Team of Enablers?
9797 2018-12-08 18:36:18 Oil change
9798 2018-12-08 18:36:17 energy is a sector in which you cannot have perfect competition. when the market was unregulated the US had a monopoly, Standard Oil: anti-trust regulation brought competition through the breaking up of the company. You are uninformed, you should read more history and econ
9799 2018-12-08 18:36:04 Omg I put too much peppermint oil in my bath and my ass is like freezing??
9800 2018-12-08 18:36:03 Hey folks, the oil industry is killing the planet and all the civility in the world won’t change that. Your local political scene needs to fight to adapt to green technologies like Georgetown, Texas did.
9801 2018-12-08 18:35:59 “The study is based on undiscovered oil and gas that's considered technically recoverable based on these modern extraction methods. That's different from the proven reserves that oil companies list on their budgets after they drill exploratory wells and study the reservoirs.”
9802 2018-12-08 18:35:57 Now that Meek's project is out, I need Ross to drop that new album. I have my beard oil and imitation crab meats ready to receive this word.
9803 2018-12-08 18:35:53 I cannot stand the odour of patchouli oil. When I go grocery shopping and catch that putred smell, it puts me off to the point where I have to abandon my shopping.
9804 2018-12-08 18:35:49 I’m sitting waiting to get my oil changed and this older couple and their son walk past when the older gentlemen stops mid-conversation and says to the rest of the waiting room, “If you show me a man with a little hen-peck, I’ll show you a man who and ain’t got a hen to peck.”
9805 2018-12-08 18:35:49 What’s your opinion on oil and natural gas and gold?
9806 2018-12-08 18:35:46 TDD時代のいちろ~はサマが全てだし絶対なんだよ
9807 2018-12-08 18:35:36 Developing nations are always going to be the last at the table for new technologies & products less reliant on oil. It’s pretty privileged to be willing to punish them for the sake of our guilt. Also also, Norway nationalized its oil industry & it partly funds social welfare.
9808 2018-12-08 18:35:36 Божечки, это так мило. *Затискала тебя в обнимашках*
9809 2018-12-08 18:35:32 Man the Jamaican black castor oil I use is like 20 bucks...I get from a Jamaican store by my house shit is insane
9810 2018-12-08 18:35:29 There is a very large portion of the population out of work, but not eligible Employment Insurance. Especially in the oil/gas industry. Even crumbs don’t get to them.
9811 2018-12-08 18:35:27 It would take a large amount of time to do that, much longer than the president will be in office. I really do hate the destruction of the rainforest but it’s also destroyed for sugar/palm oil production too which is a problem to address.
9812 2018-12-08 18:35:24 You'd be hard pressed to find a better oil!
9813 2018-12-08 18:35:19 Hormone oil?
9814 2018-12-08 18:35:10 Engine oil, try ATF all your liver, kidney, bones etc go function well.
9815 2018-12-08 18:35:10 I'm not sure our current government is any of those things. Expanding oil sands production is the exact opposite of pragmatic. We've only got a decade to dramatically curtail GHG emissions before it's game over for humanity.
9816 2018-12-08 18:35:01 Getting an oil change today cuz I’m an adult
9817 2018-12-08 18:34:58 Being an adult is your husband waking you up early on Saturday morning bc he needs an oil change 
9818 2018-12-08 18:34:51 Should have been " we won't take your oil but we'll take all the money".
9819 2018-12-08 18:34:47 This and she are the new forces of LABOR. Labor wages, Labor victims, Labor Education and Labor control of the country. Not Big oil. Nationalize big oil. Big oil is killing our Vets for Putin's help. Vote Vets.
9820 2018-12-08 18:34:44 Plus you can doctor it depending on what your skin needs. Add in oil, avocado, honey or banana if you skin is dry. Add in green tea powder for antioxidants. Charcoal power or clay if skin is oily. Or just use it alone if you can't be bothered. 
9821 2018-12-08 18:34:39 Oh my gosh. I don’t think Alberta oil industry has ever gotten a rescue payment like GM and Bombardier got? Quit screwing Alberta!
9822 2018-12-08 18:34:38 When did it become cool to have motor oil for urine?

9828 2018-12-08 18:33:55 WCS crude prices are way up since the announced mandated small production cuts.  I think this will remove some of the oil price worries in January, and increase rate hike potential.
9829 2018-12-08 18:33:49 No. I look out at English Bay where any oil tankers loaded out of Westridge would be sailing and this is not true. 
While an increase in oil tanker traffic is bad enough, it’s the spills and the fire risks of hauling all that flammable sludge through Metro Vancouver continuously.
9830 2018-12-08 18:33:46 Been sitting in BMW for 90 minutes now waiting on a basic oil change sitting next to “a-talker’....He just moved here from CA because the liberals were out of control there.  He was shunned for saying Merry X-mas...such a BS’er...My guess is he was shunned for being an idiot..
9831 2018-12-08 18:33:38 LMAO Maybe he was busy looking for oil, he has to go a lot deeper then that

9833 2018-12-08 18:33:27 Elise puffed her cheeks out when the rice was brushed away, her head nodded quickly and she moved over to sit next to Rosé. "Its super nice, and dad doesn't use any oil! He uses something that's better and it makes the food nice."

9836 2018-12-08 18:33:12 If you have any pasta and it won’t mess up your blood sugar, just pasta and a little olive oil is a really easy filling meal for times like this. Hope you’re okay 
9837 2018-12-08 18:33:07 سليط
9838 2018-12-08 18:33:06 Also people vastly underestimate how much petroleum surrounds them every day. It’s not just the fuel pump; it’s the plastics, the computers/phones, the lubricant in robotic manufacturing, medical supplies. We can get to low emissions but we are still centuries away from zero oil.
9839 2018-12-08 18:33:05 If you are roasting tiny or baby potatoes, you can boil them in salt water until barely soft, then drain, spice them and toss them in olive oil, and roast at high heat. They will have crispy outsides, delicate soft insides, and they won't scream.
9840 2018-12-08 18:32:55 Were environmentalists part of the “stakeholders” consulted?  Or, does stakeholders mean oil and gas interests?
9841 2018-12-08 18:32:52 If you like get to 1k....  Find crude oil if you want...nonsense
9842 2018-12-08 18:32:48 Ready oil pump hnd blade..
9843 2018-12-08 18:32:47 Whooo told me to buy 4 new tires and get an oil change all in one day?! Whoooooo 
9844 2018-12-08 18:32:39 It’s also not a tax but people still insist on calling it one. And the point is, it isn’t “naturally occurring” when we dig up the oil and burn it.
9845 2018-12-08 18:32:37 Ice and elevation like others have said.. I use those methods on my busted knee so I won't be in heels either for unleashed lol a good quality cbd oil Is useful too my friend has sent me some for my pain I'd get on that girl! Wishing you a speedy recovery xox

9852 2018-12-08 18:32:12 got a oil splatter burn on my finger and this is the only one to still hurt after 5 minutes
9853 2018-12-08 18:31:54 Massage the oil on the area then shave it. The are will be soft and clear of razor burn  I also only use 5 or 6 blade razors, that changes a lot

9863 2018-12-08 18:30:49 How strange in all of this oil talk folks ignore there are millions of barrels of oil reserves that could be tapped in the east if fracking was allowed by the provincial Liberals & that Quebec is sitting on tons of uranium that they block from being mined....backup plan perhaps?
9864 2018-12-08 18:30:49 I could only see palm oil sellers. Traffic isn't a norm here, so the gala and lacasera guys haven't found a market at that point yet.

9867 2018-12-08 18:30:31 You add the word ‘global’ changing the talking point is a liberal socialist tactic. Alberta’s oil problem is Canada’s - build that pipeline and get Alberta what it deserves for its resources not pennies on the dollar.

9879 2018-12-08 18:29:22 Legault doubled down “I am not at all embarrassed to refuse dirty energy when we have clean energy” Question was regarding Energy East, an oil pipeline. Does he then consider the blood tainted oil that comes down the St Lawrence from Saudi, Libya and Venezuela to be clean FFS?

9881 2018-12-08 18:29:11 Tate’s truck burns through oil real quick, he said “don’t have to get an oil change if it’s always got new oil”. His logic amazes me.
9882 2018-12-08 18:28:57 No i want to burden literally everyone. Ban private jets. Regulate commercial air travel. Ration red meat. Impose next level taxation on oil companies. Etc.

Canada loses our human rights respect when we import 100,000 barrels a day of  oil from Saudi Arabia.
9886 2018-12-08 18:28:26 What about the trillions we've borrowed to fight wars to keep the oil flowing?
9887 2018-12-08 18:28:16 I love cbd oil. I honestly feel so amazing not being an anxious wreck all the time.

9889 2018-12-08 18:28:00 One of the saddest markers for corporate greed is how they are willing to destroy the health and well being of children. Most baby formula is just sugar and soy oil. How these things aren't criminal I don't understand.
9890 2018-12-08 18:27:53 The oil firm derby

9906 2018-12-08 18:25:48 it makes me happy when other people actually respond with an oil. I love to leave people shook

9909 2018-12-08 18:25:35 For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey, And her mouth is  smoother than oil; Lest you ponder her path of life— Her ways are unstable; You do not know them.
Proverbs 5:3, 6 NKJV
9910 2018-12-08 18:25:31 Keep fracking and drilling for oil. Soon their will be nothing left! This planet will be unsustainable to support life.
9911 2018-12-08 18:25:23 Depends on what symptom is bothering you most but oil of oregano generally packs a heck of punch.
9912 2018-12-08 18:25:11 Talk about oil price, why it's not coming under GST.... Don't go through the graphs....we know how graphs r manipulated just as the so called Gujarat model
9913 2018-12-08 18:24:59 T

So... a tax on gas? Crude oil has gone way down in price. Kinda like in California, we've raised our gas tax here, so it's close to $4
9914 2018-12-08 18:24:49 Don't think too hard about it...

9915 2018-12-08 18:24:46 Wow, imagine standing firm against a felonious, philandering snake oil salesman who came to power promising poor white people he'd make them great again. Truly noble and unexpected.
9916 2018-12-08 18:24:40 @Edwincowino I read your article "Mystery surrounds a Sh30 billion commercial loan for a security system to guard a proposed crude oil pipeline". Can I see the agreement with Rafael? Thanks
9917 2018-12-08 18:24:38 Because you have tar instead of oil & you have not built the refineries. You have depended on USians to refine your bitumen & your extraction business is defined & principally owned by USians & your bitumen is priced lower because it is not as pure as Texas Crude.
9918 2018-12-08 18:24:30 Just watched the film Vice. It is a true story based on the divisive VP Dick Cheany and how he wanted Iraqi oil enough to start a war. Surprised a neo con American hasn’t gone after Saudi yet.

9922 2018-12-08 18:23:41 It is time to cleanse nicki of the hate and rebuild her, with positive energy... I want you all to take oil in the sign of the cross and pray to chevakiah ( the angel of Elevation) to remove all hinderers against her gift and allow her legendary success to be rewarded. Amen.
9923 2018-12-08 18:23:34 Norway is rich because of oil, Swiss because they are a tax haven.

9925 2018-12-08 18:23:32 The oil has healing properties but if you smoke it, you're just burning up your medicine. The CIA trafficking hard drugs into America for the last 50 years is the real problem.
9926 2018-12-08 18:23:27 Friendly reminder to get your oil change
9927 2018-12-08 18:23:23 I’ll send you some CBD oil from my company for your anxiety! 
9928 2018-12-08 18:23:18 Sure, we all believe that a man who worked his way from the bottom to become the CEO of one of the largest, well-run multinational oil and gas corporations is "dumb as a rock" and "lazy as hell."
9929 2018-12-08 18:23:18 honestly cant get used to ngolo being in that position well he did it again,The Oil state fund team need to c’me up with solution #CHEMCI
9930 2018-12-08 18:23:13 It’s takes  900 tons of steel and concrete to build ONE turbine and of course those materials require coal, oil and gas to produce.
9931 2018-12-08 18:22:58 Revealing that the fact that Rexxon's being Big Oil and an official Friend of Russia weren't his main qualifications, they were his ONLY qualifications. Nice self own, Don Don.
9932 2018-12-08 18:22:52 I like them best roasted with crushed garlic, olive oil, and sea salt.  So good.
9933 2018-12-08 18:22:49 You really just don't get it. In 10 years time (when you've set the USA back a further 10 years) the rest of the world will have moved on and secured their energy needs going into the future with renewable energy. While you are relying on coal/oil industry. Bravo. Keep it up!
9934 2018-12-08 18:22:43 Simply put... cutting off Canadian Oil from Alberta does not stop our use of oil.  That will happen with time when our public evolves to stop using oil... frankly, quite some distance off.  What obstructionism does do is hurt our economy.   Use our oil before Rogue countries!
9935 2018-12-08 18:22:17 Oil and water.
9936 2018-12-08 18:22:11 AHHHH MAN I WANT TO DIP KANTE’S HEAD INTO A POOL OF OIL AND GIVE HIM A DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE
9937 2018-12-08 18:22:10 How many supps do you take on plant based diet? I take krill oil but only to up omega 3 not as a requirement. Meat has every essential nutrient the body needs. Go troll elsewhere thnx.
9938 2018-12-08 18:22:08 He was a finance guy in the oil/gas biz that had Russian contacts. Russia has only 1 industry and it is oil/gas.  He later worked for the US taking down Russians.  

When they needed to coverup political spying, they made up a story about Page & Russia that morons still believe
9939 2018-12-08 18:22:04 EE and TMX would create CDN jobs, improve CDN economy, lower Fed/Prov tension, and be better for the environment than foreign oil imports. What incentive are @cathmckenna and the Liberal leaders being given to stand in the way of projects that would be so beneficial to Canadians?

9944 2018-12-08 18:21:41 It's also worth noting to @EdKrassen that FDR already picked a side in the war before going into it, and by manufacturing arms for the allies, along with cutting of imperialist Japans oil; we essentially entered the war before Pearl Harbor.

9955 2018-12-08 18:20:36 I dunno then, you will have to ask a black person with a beard then, but there’s always conditioner and oil to get it soft and not itchy

9962 2018-12-08 18:20:04 Isn't it great that you can find everything from "spiritual healing tea-tree oil infused, home-made soap" to plain old potatoes in a Farmers market?
9963 2018-12-08 18:20:01 This will not do anything to U.S. gas prices. If anything they will remain the same. There has been a decrease in demand for oil by India and China with their economies not growing as quickly. Whatever that does to world markets the U.S. will make up for it at home. 
9964 2018-12-08 18:19:49 very much prefer ending all hopes of that oil money club going unbeaten
9965 2018-12-08 18:19:47 Whoever controls the water, controls humanity. Oil will be as nothing. Water. Always was, is, and will be EVERYTHING..
9966 2018-12-08 18:19:32 Senzy the transfer program began 1957 Ontario just started receiving payouts 2 years ago. Ont now has the largest sub national debt in the world at 350B because fiscal mismgmt 
 Would you support a Alta oil? Support for another province is my issue not transfer payments
9967 2018-12-08 18:19:25 . REMEMBER,  Rosneft Russian oil deal can't go forward without U.S. sanctions lifted. (Worth 1/2 trillion dollars).  

THIS IS ANOTHER REASON why Russia wants leverage over Trump by getting him elected BY HACKING. 

Russia/Putin could NEVER WIELD leverage over #PresidentHillary.
9968 2018-12-08 18:19:23 The EU didn't send tanks to Glasgow when we protested, the EU isn't stealing our oil, the EU isn't forcing companies to charge us more for our own power, the EU doesn't rule out your choice to leave it. The EU isn't threatening to try to starve people if it doesn't get its way.

B. On the aid issue:

9979 2018-12-08 18:18:45 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.
9980 2018-12-08 18:18:42 It did. And you’re correct—it’s not meant to be a refutation of your point. Just a different case unlike Standard Oil & their wells-to-gas station competitive advantage. I’m interested in the fact that their marketshare of gunpowder was a primary cause of monopoly action.
9981 2018-12-08 18:18:35 Just turn off the taps. Anyone who thinks oil is the most evil thing ever just turn off the fu**** taps and go back to horse drawn wagons and stop all the transfer payments oil would have helped to fund.  Fu** u all

9986 2018-12-08 18:18:09 Poor and inconsiderate siting of current favoured wind farm technologies is a risk to wildlife. When sited considerately this can be avoided. Offshore wind creates opportunities for marine life too, just like oil rigs, they're like artificial reefs.

9998 2018-12-08 18:17:19 We do. Our vape oils can be added to any regular vape liquid and consumed through regular vape pen  or alternatively you can vape our stronger oils through our vape pens...our vape pens are for oil only. Hope that helps thank you.
9999 2018-12-08 18:17:16 I have truly been praying for this very thing for over 20 years! Years ago I saw oil derricks rising up all over Texas & other parts of the Country! Now I see this coming about! I'd say that Zinke is right Christmas DID come Early! It's truly a GIFT from Above!

10009 2018-12-08 18:16:33 I need to oil my scalp.
10010 2018-12-08 18:16:32 Yes, Obama-esque personalities will get us nowhere. Not to mention Obama is so aloof he now brags about making the US the largest oil producer in the world. He’s taken one too many boat rides with famous billionaires. We need someone not afraid to get in the mud with Republicans
10011 2018-12-08 18:16:23 Cui bono? The oil industry.
10012 2018-12-08 18:16:11 Serious question. . . . .has Nuhiu bin hiding a club foot from us all for 5 years? Fair fucks if he has. His control today was like a forklift truck with a falling oil drum.
10013 2018-12-08 18:15:55 People with money and power change the status quo. They engineer wars for oil, they deny climate change exists and the promote companies that pollute in order to make more money. These things affect the mentality and actions of the rest of us.

10020 2018-12-08 18:15:24 That just had a major earthquake in addition to still recovering from oil spills. Why would they do this?
10021 2018-12-08 18:15:22 Big oil, big auto, UAW, utilities, coal industry, legacy space and defense,  and big shorts. Good legal and good PR are critical to a big disruptor.
10022 2018-12-08 18:15:19 And stop buying their oil/gas.
10023 2018-12-08 18:15:19 Like putting ExxonMobil in charge of climate change? Oil Pipeline companies in charge of water? trump in charge of the US?

10028 2018-12-08 18:14:53 and when the easy oil money runs out, who will pay for all these things? It is certain your kids will not enjoy the same advantages and will they accept having no say in how the country is run, with a royal elite keeping whatever money is left for themselves?

10033 2018-12-08 18:14:37 Mustard Oil is an old remedy for dry lips. Before bed, dab a few drops onto your lips &amp; massage it slightly, making them soft &amp; smooth.
