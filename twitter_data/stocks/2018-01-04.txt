5 2018-01-04 23:57:31 I don’t like fact that @coinbase has daily selling limits. You may not reach that threshold but a lot of people can. No other brokerage has selling limits for stocks/options. What does this say about the service? #BTC #LTC #BCH #ETH
6 2018-01-04 23:57:03 I'm glad you at least gonna still play in it hopefully. Yeah but if the community wants it, really hard to fight. I personally do not like 2 stocks at all. Still want to play so had to adapt. :(
7 2018-01-04 23:56:52 And if you have a 401k then you can invest in stocks.  It's your choice
8 2018-01-04 23:56:24 crazy moves in junk stocks like CNET
9 2018-01-04 23:56:05 What is wrong with these people? They take health care away,clean air and water away, voting rights. They want to take medicare and medicaid away.  Why don't they take bump stocks away? Now they want to take joints away and ignore the High Crimes in the White House.
10 2018-01-04 23:56:02 Don’t use marijuana users to pad your pocket. You own stocks in private prisons and it’s not right to make people who need marijuana for pain and other treatments to worry about being arrested.
11 2018-01-04 23:55:41 With the tax savings given to companies it will clearly improve profits. Duh. That will give stocks a boost for sure. When the dust settles we will have to see if anyone besides shareholders will enjoy long term benefits. The impact on government spending is scary.

bitcoinが遅いと聞いてイーサリアムで送金したのにかれこれ1日。

出金側のQUOINEXが悪いのか、受けのstocks.exとBINANCEに問題あるのか？

出来る人はbitcoinを各口座に入れておいてポジりたいときにすぐ行動できるようにしてるんだろうか？

17 2018-01-04 23:52:08 Stocks are different flavors of soup broth. Soup is the foundation of our free enterprise system. Adam Smith wrote about it in “The Broth of Nations”. When the soup is worth 25,000, it means a lot of people want that soup so are willing to pay $1,000,000 for 25,000 gallons.

40 2018-01-04 23:50:00 I bet Joy Behar with all her bitching isn't one bit unhappy with her stocks in the stock market! I would never watch any of them again of course never have. They are the most disgusting group of women I well I can't think what to really call them and keep my dignity.
41 2018-01-04 23:49:58 Market IV: Hint of divergence shows up in #stocks today. Indexes rise, yet definitely need to catch their breath after solid Santa Claus rally Tue/Wed. @MarketSmithnotes 80 names gained in heavy volume, but 158 fell in heavy trade. Market bulls prefer the opposite #nasdaq #sp500
42 2018-01-04 23:49:20 My 2 favourite #weed stocks - $MMJ and $UMB (soon to be trading again) both multi dollar stocks in very near future.
43 2018-01-04 23:49:11 So my AU stocks have gained 350% and now I want to sell, nope I'm not allowed since I don't have a certain citizenship. This is why we need #bitcoin and #cryptocurrency

45 2018-01-04 23:48:46 Now get into stocks
46 2018-01-04 23:48:32 Is the media capable of reporting anything good? The stock market has just hit an all time high. NPR meekly says,”stocks close higher.” #meh
47 2018-01-04 23:48:12 @Samsondfstruth I look at touts as dicey stock brokers. Either pushing dicey players (stocks) or pumping up certain guys and completely fading them. I often search for their teams and often seem to lack their “plays”
48 2018-01-04 23:47:15 Funny, my biotech stocks aren't up much and seem to be lagging the overall market for months. Can you please fix this error and make my stocks higher?
49 2018-01-04 23:46:59 Trading stocks ? If it can help me not work for anyone again I’m def game  info plz
50 2018-01-04 23:46:59 Also benefits anyone who owns stocks, 401(k), IRAs, annuities, pensions etc. @Potus is working for America. When people and business is strong in America, all Americans win. Finally someone in DC is fighting for a strong America not fighting for a strong Government/Bureaucracy.

53 2018-01-04 23:45:43 That was what I thought. He has the stocks and he is selling call options to people. Ok. Now, I am clear. DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL. not because it is a sophisticated thing to do. It is very risky with this stock.
54 2018-01-04 23:45:35 Não tem tempo para essas coisas diz ele, esgotar Stocks de tinteiros para cartilhas não vale
55 2018-01-04 23:45:23 Hey, I'm trying to trade penny stocks for a living. I have 1 profitable day, but after that I'm just loosing. May you please teach me. Would you be my mentor?

Woo hoo stocks high....

60 2018-01-04 23:44:01 The list of stocks in that etf would be a long one.

62 2018-01-04 23:43:30 The diverse thing about capitalism and war, is you can buy stocks in both/all supply sides, it's just good business.  In regards to Ukraine/Russia/Nato   #tytlive Just a build up is worth billions. This does not absolve Trump of being Putins butt puppet but validates it.

66 2018-01-04 23:42:43 Nice analysis! You want to share the spreadsheet about the common stocks? Thank you very much.
67 2018-01-04 23:42:40 Yes the stocks went up
Check my stock pile account to a n8ce little bonus
68 2018-01-04 23:42:36 Jeff quit fucking with my pot stocks !
69 2018-01-04 23:42:33 Thinking Energy stocks??  So which  ones???  Dominion could be one.
70 2018-01-04 23:42:16 Everybody needs to write their senator to obstruct #JeffSessions US Attorney confirmations because I have about 10,000 shares in #otc #Marijuana stocks. I just need to make £0.50 a share and I'm out. I'm not greedy. #smallgovernment #statesrights #donttreadonme @CatoInstitute
71 2018-01-04 23:42:09 @MichaelWolffNYC your a DICK.. just wanna make money off fake stories.. hows your 401 K and stocks doing.. haha...  we who voted for him love what he is doing for Americans..  using trump to get noticed.. sad sad sad..
72 2018-01-04 23:41:45 Don’t you have some stocks to sell or something? Oh, right. Sold those before the market boomed.

74 2018-01-04 23:41:28 Mr President have Jeff Sessions leave the legal marijuana industry alone he's killing my stocks@realDonaldTrump
75 2018-01-04 23:41:24 @wolfblitzer @Swerdlick Again its all about the MONEY not anything else where y’all have just gotten a big tax cut with rest sounding grand like higher minimum wages healthcare except doesn’t touch too much those making $100K plus investments in Stocks own a home all doing fine +
76 2018-01-04 23:41:12 Would love to see the numbers on how many Trump supporters benefit from stocks.
77 2018-01-04 23:40:32 Inauguration as starting point is meaningless. 
Obama's term began after a major market low so misleading to pick an extreme low. 
Real economy revival is what Trump should focus on than the #FOMC driven elevated stocks.
78 2018-01-04 23:39:50 Clif, when you say stocks reached their heyday and died a couple of years back, are you ultimately seeing a mass exodus out of stocks in the future? Even though the DOW may be equal to gold's price per your previous reports? That would be some crazy ish...
79 2018-01-04 23:39:34 Just make a 3X ETF that is all the shit stocks that used to be great that "could"  reverse and go back up "if".....
  $LAME would kinda act like $UVXY
80 2018-01-04 23:39:32 And yet some stocks are falling, and Macy’s, for an example, is closing stores and laying off workers. Bless your heart.
81 2018-01-04 23:38:12 Everyone lost money in 2008 when Bush was in office. If you lost money from 2009 through 2016 then whoever is investing your money is highly incompetent. 3 out of 4 stocks follow the market trend so if you were invested in 100 different stocks, 75% of them should show gains.
82 2018-01-04 23:37:27 Actually that is because the market is being driven by the underground until it is legalized here in Canada , stocks will collapse to weed out the criminal profit ,then rise again as govt licences producers and retailers , however I will never buy from anyone who charges tax .
83 2018-01-04 23:36:50 Most Texas scenes live in the past. Some still doing 3 stocks over here ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
84 2018-01-04 23:36:16 >improved stocks to the highest they've been
>refused to keep giving money to terrorists
>Isis has collapsed in Syria&Iraq
>6 million new jobs (one of highest recorded)
>big bonuses to employees cuz of the tax reform
>made it easier for veterans to get disability

What a monster
85 2018-01-04 23:36:11 @JuddApatow @AP_Politics Is it time to short all of my for-profit prison stocks?
86 2018-01-04 23:35:59 It would be more impressive if it were either the original companies or true industrial stocks not a portfolio that they adjust to make themselves look better
87 2018-01-04 23:35:42 To all Canadians out there. Which platform are you trading at? TD, BMO AND RBC are down for the past couple days. #stocks #potstocks
88 2018-01-04 23:35:13 #CA08 weed is not just for smoking, it’s a way to make money, like investing, stocks, becoming a first time business owner. R’s hiked up CA’s taxes now they want to take away millions from our hands #cannabis #HighDesert #FlipItBlue2018
89 2018-01-04 23:35:12 I already have thousands invested in cannabis stocks. They took a hit today. I bought another $1k worth. That's how much faith I have in Jeff Sessions. He should stick to his true calling: making cookies.
90 2018-01-04 23:34:06 Nakamura tho, heard he's kicking about on the Stocks and Shares market these days, ballerr
91 2018-01-04 23:33:56 The only thing keeping you from buying stocks is you
92 2018-01-04 23:32:45 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
93 2018-01-04 23:32:38 Yeah. One way to speed up the process is to ask if they do things like wedding invitations or fancy shit because if they do, they're likely to have good paper stocks and better machines/equipment
94 2018-01-04 23:32:02 So pure pot plays are up and above now .. i think its a time for pot related stocks to go up 

My picks are $ESE $RGI $LSH $MXC
95 2018-01-04 23:31:45 Myself I am out of most weed stocks . Let's the shorts do thier thing . Then fucking make them pay
96 2018-01-04 23:31:43 Hey fool, He’s not paying any attention- just MSM and lefty crazies! BTW- Stocks 25k! Massive jobs, Regulations cut, economy booming, wages growing! Dimms have NO programs- only vile name calling! Big backfire! Americans don’t buy your BS-
97 2018-01-04 23:31:31 Don't forget stocks started climbing under President Obama's watch. If 45 had inherited what #44 did stocks would not be where it is today.

101 2018-01-04 23:29:56 Some would rather by Pot instead of stocks.
102 2018-01-04 23:29:55 Just was reading yesterday on Forbes about all these grow companies that had stocks skyrocket these last few days. Looks like those investors should have waited. OR time to buy while everyone sells? Haha
103 2018-01-04 23:29:46 I love stocks
104 2018-01-04 23:29:33 Jeff Sessions rolls back pot policy because:

1. He has huge stock positions in for-profit prisons

2. He is short selling pot stocks

3. Trying to distract from the Trump train wreck with Wolff's book.

4. All of the above.
105 2018-01-04 23:29:30 Doesn't it mean that he is selling call options? He didn't buy. He sold them. As in, he has the stocks and he is selling the call options. Please elaborate.
106 2018-01-04 23:29:23 Shouldve bought stocks.
107 2018-01-04 23:27:49 Biggest mistakes of 2017 - i bought $VRXand $GIMO... lost big time..
108 2018-01-04 23:27:35 Most workers in the private sector DO have retirement plans... the directors of the plans make investments in petroleum and other top stocks.
109 2018-01-04 23:27:28 Trump supporter: Stock market is soaring! 

You own stocks?

TS: No! But, corporations are going to be making billions more!

And you’ll get some of that money?

.....

Keep waiting for that trickle, Jospeh. But the only kind we’ll see this year are going to be in a pee pee tape.
110 2018-01-04 23:27:12 Yeah, ok. Cuz they do a lot of work.   This was a none issue.  That just became issue.  It’s not about just pot, it’s about business owner, stocks, and many other things I didn’t vote for pot to be priority.
111 2018-01-04 23:25:33 Market cap is meaningful in stocks and businesses not in currency and especially currency that solves a REAL WORLD problem
112 2018-01-04 23:25:06 Conservatives really don't understand what their reckless policies are doing to social stability. Ordinary people don't give a damn about the performance of stocks or GDP. The internet is as important to our daily lives as heat and running water at this point.
113 2018-01-04 23:24:34 When you first start trading your goal should be to survive. To have the best chance of survival you must only trade the best setups not scalp 100s of stocks with a low 1:2 risk/reward leave that to the 90% of traders losing $
114 2018-01-04 23:23:17 What were the wage increases for poeple on minimum wage, millions of people. Are you planning on helping them? Or just the rich so they can buy more stocks?...... Loser
115 2018-01-04 23:23:05 Haha, you’re the best, man! That Fastlane is still secure & earmarked; I know you’ve been abreast of, if not following, my sit., so thanks for being so patient!
Hilarious BS?
Kindness notwithstanding, every step of getting cash takes AGES to clear: PayPal, bank, stocks - ALL!!!
116 2018-01-04 23:22:53 Fact: "The top 100 best-performing small- and mid-cap stocks of 1996 and 1997 had an average P/E of 40."

Något att komma ihåg så länge dessa tider varar.
117 2018-01-04 23:21:59 Oh you’re far too late to that party. I first got in on these years ago when they were like penny stocks, lol
118 2018-01-04 23:21:58 holy shit, is that as big of a deal possibly to the "crypto" related stocks and all crypto as i think it is
119 2018-01-04 23:21:25 Shocking that the in less than a year, The Dow went from 20k to 25k with only 5 stocks responsible for half of those 5000 points.

Boeing +898pts
UnitedHealth +429pts
Caterpillar +407pts
3M +406pts
Home Depot +355pts
120 2018-01-04 23:21:06 @timseymour just watched you on CNBC. What cannibus stocks are you in / recommend?
121 2018-01-04 23:21:04 If companies stocks crash, they will probably go into a hiring freeze or even fire non-essential personnel.
122 2018-01-04 23:20:49 @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP You do know most people living paycheck to paycheck aren't buying stocks and aren't worried about their 401K's right? And that the president is clearly unwell? Do you know the definition of complicit? Just checking.

123 2018-01-04 23:20:28 When stocks are high for no other reason than speculation, and not on solid employment and real "wage growth" throughout a larger segment of the population, it is no different than a housing bubble. It will burst some time. Been there, done that.
124 2018-01-04 23:20:16 Maybe i should sell all my other stocks and go all in with SX :) 
125 2018-01-04 23:19:38 good job Mr. Speaker backing Congressman Nunes in his ongoing work to help Russia. you must be so very proud to help Russia and mostly turn a blind eye to Russia's engagement in our elections. Almost forgot, great job also on bump stocks... im sure the Vegas families are  pleased

135 2018-01-04 23:13:57 True.. but many of their retirement plans are invested in stocks.  Including teachers, police and firemen.

137 2018-01-04 23:13:17 Besides Bitcoin I would probably invest my money into Square Cash and PayPal stocks
138 2018-01-04 23:13:17 These stocks are feeding the market in 'beast mode,'  says #Forex
139 2018-01-04 23:12:55 I got pounded on my pot stocks today. Thanks Jeff Sessions for going back on your promise to leave it alone. States rights only matter when it suits you. Not cool.
140 2018-01-04 23:12:42 wondering if stocks are interesting enough to take up as a side hobby, he does have a bunch of Capsule Corp ones but, eh,

145 2018-01-04 23:10:42 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around

150 2018-01-04 23:09:05 yeah but we could say, when we see the general performances in 2017, that everything will continue to be pumped up ;-) Thx the FED ! Bonds - Stocks ;-) 
It is so simple today no ?
151 2018-01-04 23:08:28 The stocks aren't rallying like u so called they are doing.  They are increasing at a steady pace.  Like 1-2 percent a month where Obama had them averaging like 2-3 percent per month.  Off course u will continue breaking records when you get handed a market at an all time high
152 2018-01-04 23:08:26 I hope you get investigated for insider trading. You know you own Verizon, comcast and att stocks! You will go down in history as the man who ruined the internet!
153 2018-01-04 23:08:18 The Dow is an index of blue chip stocks. Short term investor enthusiasm is not a remedy for income inequality or wage stagnation.
154 2018-01-04 23:08:03 "But I sold my stocks anyways, because reasons"....
155 2018-01-04 23:07:13 Excited for tmrw, we have blockchain, Chinese stocks, and marijuana all in play! My oh my!
156 2018-01-04 23:06:12 @jimcramer What is the current outlook for lithium and cobalt mining stocks? What companies look like good investments?
157 2018-01-04 23:06:07 Wow!!!... to all the $POT stocks..

159 2018-01-04 23:04:43 Great opening.   Sounds like the good days when Marv  Albert would say.    On the Knicks, Starks on Fire.  Now it’s Stocks on Fire.   Well done Charles
160 2018-01-04 23:04:14 @jimcramer What is the outlook for lithium and cobalt mining stocks? What companies look like good investments?
161 2018-01-04 23:03:09 Reminds me of that time Obama said to buy stocks right around the 2009 bottom.
162 2018-01-04 23:02:38 Stocks ≠ jobs
163 2018-01-04 23:02:20 Stocks hit 25K today and all the media can focus on is Steve Bannon. #SpecialReport
164 2018-01-04 23:02:12 Good for the wealthy who own stocks
165 2018-01-04 23:02:12 the thing is..... everyone was panicking and buying out stocks of milk and bread and bottled water and rock salt... but a majority of the roads weren't salted in advance like they usually are???
166 2018-01-04 23:02:00 Thursday's 49 point (+1.4%) rally was the biggest gain seen in EuroStoxx Futures since 11 September 2017, 80 trading days earlier, and was the biggest rally on a Thursday in the 67 weeks since 22 September 2016 #stocks

170 2018-01-04 23:00:32 jawboning is their specialty. They just trying to reduce US stocks in order to drive market higher.  Its been a success in 2017!
171 2018-01-04 23:00:21 Most teacher, police and fire pensions are invested heavily in stocks.  Many Americans who live on govt dole depend on the coporations for taxes and income.

174 2018-01-04 22:58:23 Quick, but some Oracle Sparc boxes... While stocks last. Or get yourself an industrial strength mainframe.
175 2018-01-04 22:58:13 It isn’t Trump. It is the Justice Dept that wants to crack down. And FYI, Trump’s real ratings are very high. Look at the stocks.
176 2018-01-04 22:58:03 Stock market 25000 poor little snowflakes we know you have no stocks the only thing you have is your Obama phone and that's coming to an end soon too! Thanks again Trump Meister.
177 2018-01-04 22:57:58 Stocks are going great this year! Keeping an eye on bitcoin as well. #cryptocurrency #stocks #Traders
178 2018-01-04 22:57:50 you seem to be dismissing the fact that amd exploitation requires physical access. which means more secure and hence why their stocks are up.
179 2018-01-04 22:57:28 cryptocurrancy some 2017 shit we back on penny stocks 2018 don’t @ me
180 2018-01-04 22:57:17 Just received a message that Trump has been shorting Pot Stocks. Think there is any truth to this?
181 2018-01-04 22:56:54 stocksにオミセゴークラッシックってあるんだけどフォークしてたの？ｗｗ
182 2018-01-04 22:56:38 It's now 1 year since PMI announced it was aiming to become smoke free. What's happened to its stock price? 5.1.2017: $91:13; 29.12.2017: $105.65 (USD NYSE Closing). ie 15.9% increase in 2017. Seems that this approach is helping PMI stocks.
183 2018-01-04 22:56:34 It measures 30 blue chip companies in North America. 50 points in a day means that the same 30 stocks costs $50 more than yesterday in simple terms.   Oct 87, 508 pt drop = 500 billion loss.  Based on that 1000 pts = 1 Trillion or some number like that.
184 2018-01-04 22:56:26 It means I lost money today on marijuana stocks.
185 2018-01-04 22:55:39 My stocks are doing well, and I don't mind being a country worried about our own citizens.  Other countries hated us well before Trump.. So instead of signing the impeach Trump forms, and buying this book why don't you worry about something else?
186 2018-01-04 22:55:07 some good discounts on pot stocks.  just another uneducated dumbass trying to regulate an idustry he knows nothing about.  Very sad that these types of people have so much control.
187 2018-01-04 22:54:35 Yes the Dow did great today another record! However, the OTC Cannabis stocks tanked thanks to Jeff Sessions! President Trump, it’s time push Congress to change the laws to protect the Legal Cannabis industry!!   #cannabis #Marijuanastocks #MedicalMarijuana #JeffSessions
188 2018-01-04 22:54:35 @danawhite Just read your interview about Khabib fighting Tony. What an embarrassment for you and @wme. Your champ is supposed to fight the 
Interim champ. Conor is turning you and wme into laughing stocks. Who the f@#k is employing who in this buisiness relationship. 
189 2018-01-04 22:54:02 Hi. What amount is that minimum that would be logical to start investing in your recommendations? I'm just starting out. I have a Business Admin/mgt degree and have dappled in some stocks, but it's been awhile.
190 2018-01-04 22:53:51 Actually... most are based on investments in stocks.
191 2018-01-04 22:53:15 PM Mkts: #Corn -2; #Soybeans -1; Winter #Wheat -1. Lower week on week Ethanol production, increases in Etoh stocks weighed on corn. Drier midday 6-10 day forecast for S Brazil and N Argentina rallied soybeans off session lows. Weekly Export Sales tomorrrow.
192 2018-01-04 22:52:35 If Twitter was around in January 2000 this is the type of stuff people would be saying about tech stocks.
193 2018-01-04 22:52:16 Anybody trying to get into stocks or crypto and don’t know where to start hmp. I give free tips and advice. Also free picks!!!
194 2018-01-04 22:52:13 Used to hand draw charts in the 80's. It helped me become more in tune with stocks pulse. Now I follow to many. Should probably still hand draw a few.
195 2018-01-04 22:51:56 Stocks and crypto-currencies are 2 different things lol...
196 2018-01-04 22:51:32 IF DT THINKS THE ECONOMY IS SO GREAT WHY R BANK STOCKS DOWN..COST OF FOOD GONE UP.TAXES GONE UP,& COST OF LIVING GONE UP & THE OLDER GENERATION ON FIXED INCOME GETTING 3.00 MORE A MONTH WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE TRIPLE THAT ABUSE OF THE AGED.
197 2018-01-04 22:51:26 There will be no stocks with 6:1 margin left to trade at SURETRADER, Most every stock will be 1:1 margin
198 2018-01-04 22:51:22 Stocks down 1.53% today
199 2018-01-04 22:51:20 What a mess Stocks and Real Estate. @hmacbe @rosskay @garthturner @kdaniellepark @dbcurren
200 2018-01-04 22:51:01 Which means the 1% continues to invest in 30 or so stocks. This is not an across-the-board indicator of the economy. 44 handed you an economic dream.. but you keep taking credit for it, big guy.
201 2018-01-04 22:50:37 Indexes are tech managed tho right? SP500 changes out stocks do does DOW

203 2018-01-04 22:50:02 Kurt you should read one about when to sell your stocks 
204 2018-01-04 22:49:27 Trump said he'd be good for the market, yet my weed stocks tanked today. Asshole.
205 2018-01-04 22:49:03 How do you get into stocks?
206 2018-01-04 22:48:43 *accidentally opens stocks app once* lol I don’t know how y’all do that 9-5 shit.
207 2018-01-04 22:47:15 Roaring 20s:
- Mass overspeculation of stocks due to the public becoming involved with trading instead of just professional investors
- Stock Market has no regulation for the buying and selling of stock

Crypto:
- Mass overspeculation by the general public
- Little regulations
208 2018-01-04 22:47:00 S&P Futures have rallied for 3 days in a row, adding a total of 56.75 points (+2.1%), making this the biggest 3 day gain since 9 December 2016, 268 trading days earlier #stocks
209 2018-01-04 22:46:55 Yes I believe President Trump. I'm doing an Irish jig right now, because the stocks at 25075 today. I'm on the Trump Train choo choo!
210 2018-01-04 22:46:33 That's True lol. We need more of those type of plays.
211 2018-01-04 22:45:54 Market veterans say that stocks are overvalued and that a downturn is overdue. The question is how messy it will be…
212 2018-01-04 22:45:25 Stocks are doing great, democracy not so much.
213 2018-01-04 22:45:19 lol the hardest thing is to stay calm at your 9-5 when u see stocks like $CNET &  $CNIT sky rocket. #mydaywillcome #composure @timothysykes

215 2018-01-04 22:44:18 Sam's shop stocks short spotted socks.
216 2018-01-04 22:44:15 Not true you're wrong where did you get that is it because you don't have a 401k and you don't buy any stocks that's not our fault that's yours
217 2018-01-04 22:44:10 Wow. Marijuana stocks tumble. Just the words "Marijuana stocks" seem incomprehensible. Marijuana is being traded on Wall Street? Really? Next, you're gonna tell me there's a hashtag for these stocks? Oh no, there is!#PotStocks
218 2018-01-04 22:43:35 I appreciate that, but stocks would have performed the same with Clinton in office. Companies are flush with cash. The difference is, during the election, trump & his family asked 4chelp from the Russians, they received help, & conspired 2 cheat our democracy. He’s illegitimate.
219 2018-01-04 22:43:27 10 of millions of working people own billions in stocks in retirement accounts. My wife and I are middle class, working people. We have amassed nearly $1 million in stocks in our retirement accounts over the last 30 years. It is not only rich making money!

223 2018-01-04 22:42:21 I bought a few Canadian weed stocks just to have a seat on the ride.  So far they've been pretty entertaining.  Nothing big, a couple $K
224 2018-01-04 22:41:32 I have stocks and a small business. Not only did it benefit us but our employees also. Pretending this tax cut doesn’t help the middle class is just making people look like fools.
225 2018-01-04 22:41:28 That’s because there are too many. The stocks rallied again and again is enough evidence. In fact, I fought against trump during the campaign. After he won, the dollar surged, I dug in to see what I missed and found out liberal economic policies for recession was at fault.
226 2018-01-04 22:40:25 To start your problem, just start buying dividend paying stocks.  Keep on compounding and after 25-30 years, you'll most likely have this problem.
227 2018-01-04 22:39:48 I want to become an all around investor like in stocks, real estate, CDs, IRAs all that shit..venture clubs, investment clubs, etc
228 2018-01-04 22:39:01 Some of us have our stocks of storm wine and chocolate topped up too ;) #NLStorm
229 2018-01-04 22:38:10 Discretion trade took profits at the close and is now flat. Despite the $DOW's gains, the $SPX, $NDX, $RUT, and $MID were well off their highs and portend some selling after the jobs number tomorrow.    We shall see. #Trading #stocks #Futures $ES $NQ $VIX
230 2018-01-04 22:37:57 Got to count profit in terms of BTC, but yeah it's crazy! Funny thing is, most stocks/shares investors are considered gods if they get like 20% a year loool
231 2018-01-04 22:37:53 Stocks close higher on upbeat jobs report.
232 2018-01-04 22:37:14 Breaking (5:37 PM EST): Stocks making the biggest moves after hours: SHLDW, SONC & more... -- CNBC
233 2018-01-04 22:37:14 So the parasites who let their stocks work for them are getting richer. We should be caring more about working people and people looking for work. And what about these regulations, they are stopping the billionaires from being even more greedy probably.
234 2018-01-04 22:36:58 Cannabis stocks dropped because Jeff Session 
235 2018-01-04 22:36:46 Sessions has stocks to bolster
236 2018-01-04 22:36:41 Today is the last day for pre-orders but if we dont sell the very few stocks we have left, the store will continue to be open until shipping is done. After that, the zine will only be available during local cons ^o^
237 2018-01-04 22:36:16 Stocks go up, stocks go down, how you profit off of that is your own decision. Anyone investing and not accounting for shorts, pump & dumps-
238 2018-01-04 22:36:10 how could it be weed stocks, with our AG being who he is
239 2018-01-04 22:35:50 ...And that is a huge tailwind for a lot of stocks.  I'm a dummy for trying to short anything with that factor in mind.  I know better.
240 2018-01-04 22:35:49 I need to invest in some stocks.
241 2018-01-04 22:34:34 You do realize that stocks have a correlation to the economy? Back to economics 101 and then come back and comment. Smh
242 2018-01-04 22:34:04 $CCIH joined $CNIT and $CNET party now. I guess low float china stocks are back in play!
243 2018-01-04 22:34:00 Buy Amazon stocks.
244 2018-01-04 22:33:43 I've tuned in for 12 years...  yes, back when @DylanRatigan had the traders on Bullseye...  if you want to talk stocks and things related to stocks, I'll tune in...
When it becomes political or focused on collectibles, I'm out.  
Have a great night.
245 2018-01-04 22:33:22 Yes, the stocks show who is for real and who just talks.
246 2018-01-04 22:33:17 Oh my!  Time will tell!  Funny mostly due to oil prices are high and tech stocks are also up!  Big tax breaks for large corporations while some are not hiring additional staff they are laying off!  What about middle America?  They are the ones who will suffer.

263 2018-01-04 22:25:31 @jimcramer what Eu or UK stocks would you consider buying today for long term?
264 2018-01-04 22:25:29 Keep spinning your tales about how good the stock market is for the regular people who don't own stocks. It does absolutely nothing for their bank account or pocket book. The only ppl making money are those fortunate enough to have money to buy stocks, and the right ones at that.
265 2018-01-04 22:25:22 Yessir this is definitely a decent buy under 8 plus its oversold right now
266 2018-01-04 22:25:19 your charting abilities are not limited to stocks I see.

269 2018-01-04 22:25:10 why is this person going to be in a mess before long if his retirement is doing well? please explain, because without knowing what funds/stocks/etc this person owns, how do you know that?
270 2018-01-04 22:25:01 Ok, so I think we agree. Although, I gotta say, in a weird way bad comp stocks could be more useful in identifying athletic ability. Superior athlete collect stocks just on their tools vs bad comp. Vs good comp, need to have more IQ/experience to do it - more raw athletes can't

273 2018-01-04 22:24:08 himself to bandy about on Twitter. Surely you’re busy checking the stocks.
274 2018-01-04 22:24:03 Market decides that, last time I checked stocks & real estate looked pretty suspicious too but hey 
275 2018-01-04 22:23:32 are you suggesting to buy??
276 2018-01-04 22:23:17 Whatever happened to apprenticeships?

How is anyone supposed to get out of poverty if you need skills and certifications that cost money that people without those skills and certifications can't afford to get?

Not everybody has parents who own stocks and property.

278 2018-01-04 22:22:22 Ripple is a $ price phenomenon equivalent to penny stocks.  I pray those that have done well make the prudent decision to switch into Bitcoin.  Otherwise, when the tide goes out, it’s going to be an ugly site.  Many are going to lose their shirts as well as their pants.
279 2018-01-04 22:21:49 25% of Americans have stocks-----

$5,000 investment =  $75,874 return.  #ecommerce
284 2018-01-04 22:20:39 I have been tracking boxscores for ages, you can see literally how bad competition or lower level teams dont accumulate stocks, it's eye popping, so if a guy is putting up those numbers against lower levels I do think you should account for that
285 2018-01-04 22:20:30 They keep bragging on the stock market majority of people do not have stocks and Company they do not have 401k so what does the stock market have to do with the people who struggle nothing but make the rich richer
286 2018-01-04 22:19:40 no...the Dow does reflect strength across the entire market, and to some degree reflects strength in the broader economy...however, the current strength in stocks is almost entirely attributable to low interest rates...should rates increase, look for a sharp fall in stocks
287 2018-01-04 22:19:37 @SEC_Enforcement  should SEC investigate on Trump? There is a conflict of interests there as a President talking about stocks every day imho. Did he still own some shares?
288 2018-01-04 22:19:33 Good ... I am sure Dems will pay money for it ... they need lies, gossips and demonic theories to stay afloat ... REALITY is too harsh on them: jobs, salaries, taxes, growth, energy, immigration, wall, law enforcement, stocks etc ... Keep in virtual reality mode! #MAGA

292 2018-01-04 22:18:21 This would be a great time to invest in marijuana stocks while they're down because I doubt republicans will let Sessions go forward due to their fear of 2018 elections.  #StonersVoteToo

294 2018-01-04 22:18:03 The difference between Obama & trump.  Bond ( military )stocks down,  dividend  stocks up that's what sold. Trump stock is across the board.
295 2018-01-04 22:17:30 Did you finish school?           The stock market creates wealth ONLY for those who participate. Bobby and Susie down the lane can’t afford health care under trump let alone have stocks!
296 2018-01-04 22:16:49 more like bull shit. When you understand stocks then tweet abt them
297 2018-01-04 22:16:25 Shows how much you know about your enemy.  He is a real estate investor and avoids stocks.
298 2018-01-04 22:16:01 All that matters is what 10-yr yields do. If it’s oil that makes them go up, or wages, or just the lack of QE. The only thing that changes demand for stocks will be rates that are too high.

304 2018-01-04 22:13:53 I buy stocks that i think will go up and when the start acting poorly i sell them
305 2018-01-04 22:13:52 Another great month for job creation last month was 256,000 jobs & today the Dow hit an all-time high of over 25,000 1st time in history in less than 30 days 2 records were broken. Stocks didn't crash like many predicted when Trump took office. GDP IS unemployment 
306 2018-01-04 22:13:23 No for me, maybe for you. I don’t have enough money to buy stocks. I’m the middle class that your father fucked over.

309 2018-01-04 22:12:32 Lots of tweets on Blockchain lately. Where do you stand on it? It’s very likely avbubble (short-term) but ‘bubble’s’ have pre-empted every new massive infrastructural advancement in history, and the shift’s always been bumpy. Cars on roads for horses, railways, stocks, the web...
310 2018-01-04 22:11:36 Good call. Perhaps there could be an honour guard, orphans  on one side, and peasants in stocks on the other, with the Windsor council officials tasering any orphans who don't show enough enthusiasm.
311 2018-01-04 22:11:16 @aero_precision any chance there are stocks and grips that match the builders set?
312 2018-01-04 22:10:27 @Wealthsimple I wish I could purchase individual stocks through your platform. Love your solution, just want to dabble myself... and the other solutions out there, unapproachable, pricing models are a mess etc. Future feature idea for you guys in 2018? haha
313 2018-01-04 22:09:57 So in your world only 1 percent of Americans owns or invests in stocks.  Man I would love to see your research on that number please.
314 2018-01-04 22:09:55 Good news for the 20% who own stocks. Policies working? For who? #TaxScam . Jobs? Tell that to the 400 miners who are losing their jobs do to mine closing. Or the Macy employees who will lose their jobs due to stores closing. A lie is a lie.
315 2018-01-04 22:09:20 i like this ticker down here in the dumps. below 8 seems like a good opportunity to start buying this future drone company
316 2018-01-04 22:09:18 Collectively, 4 in 10 Americans, 43 percent, own stocks.  Lot's of folks left out of this windfall.
317 2018-01-04 22:09:01 I think I am done day trading stocks.   I have made huge percentages on cryptos.   I am going in bigger
318 2018-01-04 22:08:51 You do know the average American doesn’t have any Stocks or Bonds and less than $500 in Savings, so WTF does this have to do with The Rent!
319 2018-01-04 22:08:14 Thanks for the mention @ShiftParadigm Happy 2018!!!
320 2018-01-04 22:07:48 in 2012. Cover of Time magazine. "stocks are dead... And bonds are deader".

Quite possibly the BEST 5 year run since that time.
321 2018-01-04 22:07:46 yes!!!
322 2018-01-04 22:07:31 It looks like 2007 and big players rotating to commodities as the dollar falls and out of stocks for the sucks to eat.
323 2018-01-04 22:07:07 A weird feeling of 'I don't care' grows inside me. I trade and everything works fine but the comicality of creating money to support the stock market out of thin air deeply irritates me. What is the difference between this policy and the supression of free will? Explain! #stocks
324 2018-01-04 22:07:04 About a year ago I recall a fella flaunting his stocks at the airport. The value was staggering. I hope no one is looking over my shoulder while I check my cryptos in a year. Plenty of room to grow! 2018 we will rock you. #Blockchain #cointicker #neodius
325 2018-01-04 22:06:30 £1 just became £47 absolutely laughing. Stocks & shares clearly the smartest idiot you'll ever know
326 2018-01-04 22:06:21 Tune in right now to @CNBC to hear a bunch of white males circle jerk about the DOW hitting 25,000. And of course one white male just praised defense contractor stocks and state how poorly they supposedly did "under Obama". America is a war and profits first nation.
327 2018-01-04 22:06:11 pot stocks took a 30% hit today.. not a good hit
328 2018-01-04 22:05:59 I'm sure the rebels have everything under control. But if it's all the same to them I'll just double check my ammo stocks
329 2018-01-04 22:03:46 They should take your stocks watchlist i.e, crypto, cannabis, ... and ban all of them
330 2018-01-04 22:03:43 Sure the #Dow closed above 25,000 for the first time ever, but priced in #gold the Dow is unchanged on the year.  There is an excellent chance that 2018 will be the start of a major bear market in U.S. stocks priced in gold!

Stocks r up an up and more than 2m jobs have been created since Nov8th 2017. Liberals put that in ur bong and smoke it.
353 2018-01-04 21:57:58 Increasing the number of stocks trading has next to zero affect for the people who don’t own stock. Otherwise, the wealthy get wealthier as do the shareholders. Possibly there will be an increase in private pensions but where will those pensions be in the long run?
354 2018-01-04 21:57:13 In a (even more) dystopian future, you could monetize your predictions by investing in stocks of the fully privatized police forces.

361 2018-01-04 21:54:25 Self educate yourself on stocks and have a capital accumulation plan. Don't let someone do it for you. Know how to manage and invest your money.
362 2018-01-04 21:54:06 The 'market for information' around stocks is bias in the direction of bullishness, given the prominence given to mgmt teams, sell side shills, paid IR, etc that I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill.
363 2018-01-04 21:54:00 Ok no worries. We will have to try and find somewhere that stocks it to try 
364 2018-01-04 21:53:50 Now that all old shit getting more attention, it comes clearer why someone dumped all stocks

368 2018-01-04 21:53:13 He must not own stocks in the Oil company vying for this tRump gift. We all know he will be given some sort of payoff to agree wholeheartedly.
369 2018-01-04 21:52:58 All financial analysts are economists, there are too many of them in so many institutions. People should watch what people do, not what they say. Buying stocks is action, and shows true confidence.

377 2018-01-04 21:50:52 We're on the cusp of, at a minimum, a big move in TLT like 2011 or 2014. Whether it involves a giant equities bust remains to be seen (certainly could). Note that in 2014-6, it involved only a bust in cyclical stocks and a rotation into speculative growth stocks. Averages held up

389 2018-01-04 21:48:09 If I had 10 mil, I’d immediately pay off all of my family’s debt. Move my mom back home to the Philippines, build her orphanage, invest in real estate in multiple college towns/tourist locations, and buy stocks. Oh and get a nice used car.

391 2018-01-04 21:47:41 A REP Company would be amazing!
392 2018-01-04 21:47:13 Anyone know what Japanese stocks did on the day Nagasaki was bombed?
393 2018-01-04 21:46:49 This is exactly the kind of ill-conceived notions that the Republicans are becoming legendary for. While he sits there and claims a moral superiority motivated the decision, we know that he has stake in the for-profit prison industry and wants to pad his stocks! 1/2
394 2018-01-04 21:46:19 That's great for your rich friends who own stocks. But what about those of us just scraping by who don't own any stocks? Oh yeah, I forgot. You only care about the upper class. #IMPEACH!
395 2018-01-04 21:46:16 So someone explain to me how to buy penny stocks when typical minimum transaction fees are what $5-$7 each? You will have to get exponential growth just to break even? #SimpleMan #SimpleMath #BitCoinMeBlazer
396 2018-01-04 21:46:04 DONALD, the Tax Reform is a very Important Thing. For now it's enough. Later in Years 2019-2020 try to implement even lesser taxes. The U.S. Economy will boom, Stocks will go UP. Now it's Time for Infrastructure repairs, the Wall, Defense Shield, Development of Lasers. Rgds.
397 2018-01-04 21:45:36 Feeling peckish? Need a caffeine and sugar boost to get home through the cold? Swing by for a coffee and get a free gloryhole donut (while stocks last) with your purchase. 
398 2018-01-04 21:45:27 What stocks performed well for you in 2017?
399 2018-01-04 21:45:01 The weed stocks took a hit today. Thanks Jeff Sessions
400 2018-01-04 21:45:00 Dow 25,000!! #stocks #Dow25K
401 2018-01-04 21:43:32 Don't have it handy, but I doubt it even matters. Would have been hard to lose buying ten big-cap stocks at that point.
402 2018-01-04 21:43:23 @michaelsantoli  Why is Ron Insana  back on CNBC? He is a failure & knows little about stocks. He had to close Insana Capital Partners. No one cares what he thinks & viewers should ignore what he says. So many better options to have as guests.
403 2018-01-04 21:43:22 Trump should just issue bonds to buy Dow stocks to lock in his re-election
404 2018-01-04 21:43:14 Interest rates rising and growth stocks powering ahead is always a bad setup for utilities, but that should be only temporary. If you’re in $duk for the long term, it should be for the solid and growing dividend.

407 2018-01-04 21:43:10 STELLA FACTION stocks slump
408 2018-01-04 21:42:47 Many people talk about why buying smaller altcoins is superior to major cryptocurrencies because Bitcoin may go up x2, but smaller altcoins can have x100 returns. This type of mentality is NOT new and generally pushed by amateurs. Penny stocks are frowned upon for a reason.
409 2018-01-04 21:42:28 What's the major drive of the decline? other growth stocks attracting more of the dollars?
410 2018-01-04 21:42:26 It's like we're returning to the dark ages. When are we going to bring back the stocks or the ducking stool?
411 2018-01-04 21:42:04 The market has been very good past few days. I previously was 90% in all Tech Stocks $MU $AMD $SOXL and 10% in Reits. I have reduced my position in all but I still hold a healthy amount. #stocks #investment
412 2018-01-04 21:42:03 So we should be able to the sue the government for fucking with our marijuana stocks right?

lol
413 2018-01-04 21:41:44 Martha Stewart went to prison for less. But since its a white man, probably will get a cushy "retirement" package instead.

Funny how it always seems to work out for them.

Like how a Congressman can boost his stocks by passing legislation but that's not criminal? I don't get it.
414 2018-01-04 21:41:41 Only a few big ones out there. The rest are trash. It's penny stocks all over again.
415 2018-01-04 21:39:59 A lot of these Biothech stocks are closing shop worldwide.
416 2018-01-04 21:39:43 That's because we don't have a batsh*t crazy leader. Our guy actually embraces marijuana and realizes the old school fight against it hasn't been working. Its just been making criminal organizations rich.
417 2018-01-04 21:39:40 Look into weed stocks 
418 2018-01-04 21:39:28 that is a brilliant question. I'm going to go out on a limb and say if there are "red" stocks and "blue" stocks (i.e. those favored by investors of different affiliations), it might help explain a small portion of the low implied correlation we are seeing today.
419 2018-01-04 21:39:10 In store now , phonics levels 3, 4 and 5 , also first stories , 3, 4, 5 and 6 , get them while stocks last 
420 2018-01-04 21:39:02 Thanks to Obama, the economy is on solid footing & stocks are showing optimism for the future. Infrastructure can create jobs. #GOPtaxScam will only increase national debt.   @DemGovs
421 2018-01-04 21:38:59 What were the "10 stocks for the next 10 years"?
422 2018-01-04 21:38:36 To clarify what I mean: "By May 1896, the first DOW Jones Industrial Average was calculated using the top 12 stocks in the market." - Investopedia. So, it took the DOW from May 1896 til November 8, 2016 to reach 18,332.74 and from that day til today to reach 25,075 points. Hello?
423 2018-01-04 21:38:25 Investors in alcohol and tobacco stocks don’t want legalized marijuana. Direct competition
424 2018-01-04 21:37:47 Well, the economists who suggested buy stocks after Trump won, their actions agree.
425 2018-01-04 21:37:24 Jeff maybe it's time to retire, your out of touch with
Reality. It's been proven the medical benefits are good
 Sale you stocks in prisons.

428 2018-01-04 21:36:57 What about bump stocks?
429 2018-01-04 21:36:50 No like how much u spent in penny stocks to flip it to 5k? Lol
430 2018-01-04 21:36:45 À ce stade, la question c'est "replace  with what ?". Quelqu'un a des stocks d'Alpha et de 486 ?
431 2018-01-04 21:36:36 No. I really don't think so. If enough people think the Dow is headed to 30,000 - and no reason why it shouldn't - then 30,000 is where it'll go. Fundamentals, PE ratios, blah, blah, blah, aren't how it works. (I've been doing this long enough). #Stocks #Markets
432 2018-01-04 21:36:19 Stocks reflect that line of thinking but you're definitely right that after Tuesday a whole lot of computing power is going to be reduced by 5 to 30% due to the patches to Windows 10. Still AMD processors are vulnerable to Spectre and pretty much every smartphone too.
433 2018-01-04 21:35:58 the only ones who come out ahead are the multi-millionairs that can buy up all the depleted stocks a penny on the dollar and increase their fortunes even more cause they just came closer to owning it all by sheer piling up of wothless stocks that will not stay worthless for long
434 2018-01-04 21:35:42 People got destroyed by $CNET today. Yall the real ones that actually showed your losses. Damn chinese stocks
435 2018-01-04 21:35:21 Some folks got rich off them Chinese stocks today
436 2018-01-04 21:35:11 Now everybody all a sudden investing in stocks
437 2018-01-04 21:34:36 I just don't understand these articles.  We ALL know most cryptocurrencys are overvalued and understand that their fluctuations are massive.  Where is the article telling investors to exercise caution when investing in penny stocks or any other hyper volatile investment?
438 2018-01-04 21:34:33 Millennials are getting rich off of crypto and pot stocks Rob. Lots of cash for down payments!
439 2018-01-04 21:34:12 Invest in Weed stocks. Imma say it once people
440 2018-01-04 21:33:59 How did your stocks perform!!!?
441 2018-01-04 21:33:59 Saw a report the other day-they are getting people off hard drugs by using weed. People use weed to not use opioids for pain. Sessions/trump own prison and big pharma stocks. They don't care about people.
442 2018-01-04 21:32:50 #2018 - Love your upbeat. Meanwhile stocks on way to $30000?
443 2018-01-04 21:32:01 Notice how the news was timed when most of the marijuana stocks were over bought I've always been a firm believer that the news is dictated by the technical is not the other way around
444 2018-01-04 21:31:57 All mj stocks did. Shorting again are you. 
445 2018-01-04 21:31:48 I lost all the money I made this week on pot stocks.  They went up for the first time and this guy has to screw me
446 2018-01-04 21:31:30 Shouldn’t have sold your stocks
447 2018-01-04 21:31:23 Last summer I bought stocks in a few marijuana companies. Jeff “weed is as bad as heroin” Sessions just made all of them plummet.

450 2018-01-04 21:30:53 I heard a rumour that if there is a market crash that someone has to own those stocks all the way to the bottom? That can't be true, can it?
451 2018-01-04 21:30:42 The top five stocks that fell today were $LB, $WBA, $FRT, $M, and $REG.
452 2018-01-04 21:30:31 All 94% of TOP INCOME group owned stocks in 2016, got richer.
Barely one-third of families in the bottom 50% 
of earners own stocks, according to the Federal SEC

454 2018-01-04 21:30:12 who all knows about stocks ???

-Kentucky Bourbon

-Tuscan Vineyards
-NYC Bars
456 2018-01-04 21:29:44 Maybe a chance that IC will pick CROS again as one of its stocks for 2018 
457 2018-01-04 21:29:18 The top five stocks that gained today were $AMD, $ARNC, $SRCL, $MU and $AAP.
458 2018-01-04 21:29:15 You know how tech companies boost their valuation by buying start ups and stockpiling patents? Oil companies boost their valuation by stockpiling oil leases. They aren't using millions of acres of leases. Expanding leases doesn't add output, it just boosts oil stocks.
459 2018-01-04 21:29:13 Very true, it was really just a musing of the "if I'd known then..." variety.

Mind you, if we'd all known in various "thens" what we know now, millionaires would be paupers because everyone would have played stocks, lotteries, gambles, etc to make trillions.
460 2018-01-04 21:29:04 Thank you guys I couldn't have done it without your support @timothysykes and @Jonk87 @tbohen for all your motivational YouTube posts on Stocks to Trade! @Steven1_994 I'm coming for you baby!
461 2018-01-04 21:29:02 It reflects if you have stocks, bonds, 401k, etc
462 2018-01-04 21:28:43 In recent times neither of them have been much help in use for the entire equity  of stocks.  So many big time name advisers have been vry wrong & calling for the declines it just kep moving higher. now at 25000 DJIA
463 2018-01-04 21:28:43 Doing great job, Sarah. Not sure I could be as patient at those press briefings. We, the public would love it if they were as interested in the things going on that matter to us like higher stocks, jobs, and less taxes. They all look like children.
464 2018-01-04 21:28:29 Can't stand the daily press conference..Get rid of those hacks...its brain numbing you have to change it .I learn nothing but drama. @PressSec I want to know about businesses to invest in.. What stocks to  invest in... Real news I can use ... These same ppl everyday are terrible
465 2018-01-04 21:28:22 Most of them have stocks in private prisons, I expect.
466 2018-01-04 21:28:14 so basically $CNET is making all china stocks go bonkers, couple of ones to watch are $CCCL $CNIT $CCIH
467 2018-01-04 21:28:10 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $INTC, $GE, $BAC, and $MU.
468 2018-01-04 21:27:57 Extreme Monetary Policy!!!

Bad news is good news...

If a nuclear bomb goes off the Fed will cut rates to negative 17 and anything dollar denominated will go up including stocks.
469 2018-01-04 21:27:55 Dow records don't mean much,except to 54% of Americans invested in market, through individual stocks, mutual funds, pensions or retirement plans like a 401(k), per Gallup. DOWN since 2008

471 2018-01-04 21:27:24 Too bad @realDonaldTrump called it a bubble caused by artificially low interest rates at 18,000 and recommended everyone dump their stocks.
472 2018-01-04 21:27:14 A definite yes on all 3 stocks you mentioned! Cheers
473 2018-01-04 21:26:26 What does this really mean? Should I start investing? How does someone who doesn’t play stocks benefit from the bull? Remember- what goes up must come down?
474 2018-01-04 21:26:21 $MJ stocks overdue for a pullback. Trader’s got their reason to lock in some of recent profits. The rally isn’t over.
475 2018-01-04 21:25:57 $SPI entered a swing here. Like the chart and oil/energy stocks are moving... And then there's China...
476 2018-01-04 21:25:48 @_dyldo29 @Billerina716 even if you don’t care about stocks just watch the vid 
477 2018-01-04 21:25:38 I'll be shocked if there isn't someone buying pot stocks under Sessions/Trump's guidance on this dip and then Sessions will back off
478 2018-01-04 21:25:27 I want to exchange my gold for productive assets at some stage, meaning I'd need to sell it to aquire currency to buy shares, real estate, etc.
Basically I want to invest depending on which phase the stock/gold ratio is in (secular rising = stocks, secular falling = gold).
479 2018-01-04 21:25:26 Love my stocks and going on more vacations with the money #CheddarLIVE

484 2018-01-04 21:24:39 My 6th great grandfather went to D.C. to talk to the then Secretary of War (we don't have that) and I have all the letters to prove it all :) My point is, it is a good day when our stocks and economy does well.
485 2018-01-04 21:24:38 Five Leaves stocks it
486 2018-01-04 21:23:42 Rally continues around the world: Europe +.9%; US +,4%. Early 2018 continues the bull run of 2017. Rising earnings can moderate high P/E ratios. Bond proxy stocks likely to underperform as interest-rates rise but market overall should do fine if not providing 2017-like returns.
487 2018-01-04 21:23:19 And its tweets as this that makes Jimmy the renowned reporter he is Always on top of the new story! Hey Jimmy, did your stocks climb today?
488 2018-01-04 21:23:15 That's true. Sadly, for some strategies, it's not applicable if you're looking for undervalued stocks for example.
489 2018-01-04 21:23:13 That’s because bitcoin, unlike stocks, is not backed by the central bankers’ printing press.
490 2018-01-04 21:22:34 The @MarijuanaIndex United States Index shows a 20.5% decline today, while the Canadian Index only shows a 5.9% decline.
491 2018-01-04 21:22:15 I'm retired and we've done so well since the election that I'm now way overloaded with stocks and probably should rebalance.( a nice problem to have)
492 2018-01-04 21:22:05 Butchered that sentence
* Seasonally this week (ending 5 feb) is a week of gaining stocks but last week(ending 29dec) normally sees falling stocks.
493 2018-01-04 21:22:03 The best sale ever for me is when stocks are on sale, and it's time to go shopping for amazing companies!
494 2018-01-04 21:21:28 Je dois m’intéresser à la bourse des valeurs #stocks et si possible m’investir 
495 2018-01-04 21:21:23 Au pire si je te trouves des mangas ou que tu en veus tu me le dit et je les stocks chez moi tu les lis quand tu viens à la maison et je continue de les stockés jusqu'à ce que tu puisses avoir plus de place si tu veux princesse
496 2018-01-04 21:20:49 Yes, stocks at 25,000 today.
497 2018-01-04 21:20:48 Global stocks rally as dow reaches 25,000 @CNN
498 2018-01-04 21:20:26 Most people who own stocks are the the top 1 to 10% so when the stock market does well the Millionaires and billionaires of America are the ones that benefits from it.
499 2018-01-04 21:19:58 Yes, weed is a federal crime. Perhaps that is the point. But it does allow Sessions friends to build new private prisons. Buy the stocks.
500 2018-01-04 21:19:25 thx jeff sessions, i just lost like 50 bucks today in my cannabis stocks you penis man

507 2018-01-04 21:18:45 Looking for a chance to #invest in #canabis business. MJX .  Investors just plunked downs hundreds of millions into this ETF. Good timing . #canabis #stocks took a hit today. Sessions bark will have very little if any bite at all. #investing Fund can #invest worldwide. Good spec.
508 2018-01-04 21:18:11 WTI is actually rather overpriced now. Seasonally this week (ending 5 feb) is a week of gaining stocks but not this week. Perhaps to do with Christmas holiday falling into last week?
509 2018-01-04 21:17:47 U.S. stocks higher at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.63%
510 2018-01-04 21:17:40 Marijuana legalization has saved lives (due to less deaths from opiods) and helped many ppl with medical issues but hey, #Sessions needs to fill his jails with good ppl to fill his pockets. Does he also have stocks in the funeral biz?
511 2018-01-04 21:17:18 Thought he was clamping down on illegal pot? Time to buy those legal marijuana stocks!
512 2018-01-04 21:16:59 Very true.

However, is that much different than the nuttiness that is printing stocks and IPO mania?
513 2018-01-04 21:16:57 Feels like 1928 all over again. Wealth inequality at an all time high, stocks at an all time high. Huge tax cuts for corporations. All we are missing is Black Tuesday. Our time is coming.

532 2018-01-04 21:10:38 I don’t like #stocks like $MARK. Aggressive but volatile. If the breakout fails like today, reduce the position. You never know how the stock will open tomorrow. You can always increase the size again!

545 2018-01-04 21:06:46 This is a sign that the extremely rich are doing very very well indeed. It is not a sign they the average person is doing well or even that the economy is doing well.

Especially since there's almost no humans involved in trading stocks anymore.

552 2018-01-04 21:05:11 Elizabeth, in essence, they are taking our voting rights away.  This is way beyond a disaster.  Session must step down, it's a conflict of interest for him.  He owns stocks in private prisons and if the government does this to states, his prisons will be overflowing.
553 2018-01-04 21:04:44 stocks or bonds?

The one Senator willing to hold the Attorney General Sessions feet to the fire has resigned at your insistance. Sessions is now reengaging in the War On Drugs, probably due to his Private Prison stocks. You need to replace Sen. Franken in this.

582 2018-01-04 20:54:16 I have to step in. If I may??  Every statement you made is false. Under Obama GDP never went up more then a 2.1 under trump in 1 yr 4.3, stocks are record highs under trump in 17 yrs. Taxes cut, hasn't been done in 32 yrs. Not one dem wanted to help the American people.

589 2018-01-04 20:50:15 I'm heavily invested in stocks and crypto and see both as great investments if you know what you're doing. I've made 250% in two days trading crypto for example and am up a couple hundred % in stocks. Saying someone who trades crypto isn't an investor is just downright stupid.

596 2018-01-04 20:47:51 Haha.. true.. Don't know till when the stocks will be driven on the basis of liquidity. Even global markets are also making new highs every week. And it's not like that I'm being bearish or missed the train but now it feels scary.. The valuation comfort is no more there.
597 2018-01-04 20:47:20 Dow 25k great but doesn’t help most Americans. New study: 85% of stocks owned by top 10% & only 25% of people own more than $25k of stocks.

There is no real reason this week.  But how to sell such a move?

630 2018-01-04 20:37:48 Yeah. Its not just about hacking, the OS workarounds will slow the cpus down. In other news: intel ceo sold all his stocks down to minimum allowed (250k shares) a month back.
631 2018-01-04 20:37:44 No one gives a shit about anything as long as stocks go up! As a result, expect global governments and central banks to make sure the stock markets go up for a very long time!
632 2018-01-04 20:37:39 What like Sparc? Hahahahaha... Buy now while stocks last.
633 2018-01-04 20:36:46 The same reason $5 stocks move higher %s than $500 stocks on positive news. More people can afford to trade $5 stock. This is my guess on Ripple, not an educated opinion :)
634 2018-01-04 20:36:21 Stock market took a dive today so I bought $2000 in penny stocks. Gotta take advantage of those dips.
635 2018-01-04 20:36:04 Obama didn't do crap... stocks are based on futures and speculation.  Obama's 8 year GDP growth was a pathetic 1.5%

638 2018-01-04 20:35:42 Missed the opportunity to short on $CNET, but it is alright, the stock squeezed all day and I frankly would not be confident with my position. I wouldn´t be surprised if shorts get squeezed once more! #stocks #trading #Pennystocks #StockMarket
639 2018-01-04 20:35:08 Can companies keep printing more stocks when they feel like it? Ripple has full control over every aspect of their "product", the don't have to consult anyone. But please go on
640 2018-01-04 20:35:03 You must have had very bad stocks, since the market nearly tripled under Obama.

644 2018-01-04 20:33:07 I see his tweets because I follow every ticker in the sector.. so when I see him pumping no bid stocks on the cash tag, its pretty apparent he's just some low-level pumper/promoter. No technical skill whatsoever.
645 2018-01-04 20:31:57 Yeah I only invest small amounts in individual stocks. My facebook investment is up 1000%, so that was fun. But it's only a few thousand.

649 2018-01-04 20:31:27 AT&T to cut about 4,600 jobs, Macy's is cutting 5,000 jobs and closing seven stores. 2017 had the most store closings in history.  Our economy is bleeding jobs like crazy in the retail sector. But stocks are up so why should we care, right?
650 2018-01-04 20:31:27 Amazing. @CNN needs to vet their analysts they have on air. Every single one predicted a stock market crash with a @realDonaldTrump victory. This isn’t a crash. Glad I kept all my stocks and didn’t listen.
651 2018-01-04 20:31:06 It's a ticking time bomb that every real investor can see. (not calling myself a investor) I just had a 2 hour conversation with one, being my dad, explaining all these things it's better to read up on actual stocks and trade there
652 2018-01-04 20:30:56 1. Not a bad advice though.. At least he knows how to become rich.
2. Bad advice. Never buy stocks if you have no idea what it is. Don't touch it.
653 2018-01-04 20:30:55 Putin wins, we lose again. Thanks #maga folks, we're laughing stocks around the world.
654 2018-01-04 20:30:49 They have removed the protections that were put in place after the last crash, so when the rich manipulate the stocks again they can make more money while your 401k lose a lot of money.
655 2018-01-04 20:30:14 Fantastic! Looking forward to seeing what’s coming 
656 2018-01-04 20:30:10 @edwardrooster Better question is whether the tax savings have been priced in 2017, but then it's the same question for ALL awesome stocks
657 2018-01-04 20:30:04 What about bump stocks?
658 2018-01-04 20:29:55 haha if you call me a stock promoter you'll get blocked ... something with a name "MoMoPicks" is a stock promoter. He also is trying to get people to buy garbage no bid stocks like $MJMJ and $GRLF -- he knows nothing.
659 2018-01-04 20:29:50 I always see ppl posting screenshots of their penny stocks doing well. Lmao last year I was trading ETFs like I actually know what I was doing
660 2018-01-04 20:29:35 Putin wins. We lose, again. Thanks #maga folks, we're laughing stocks around the world now.
661 2018-01-04 20:29:34 The main issue with ripple $xrp  (and all other altcoins) Is that the people trading them have never traded stocks. Learn how to read indicators on a chart and you can predict with a general accuracy when the price will change. Start with MACD
662 2018-01-04 20:28:53 that means btc , ltc, and some any btc related stocks have a huge move up yet to be seen
663 2018-01-04 20:28:45 So, by your logic, any stock, asset or commodity that is tied to corporate guidance is "garbage"? I'm assuming that means you don't hold stocks either.
664 2018-01-04 20:28:41 Today's wisdom of the teabag tag:  "Trust is the union of intelligence and integrity."  Thank you, Yogi.  
665 2018-01-04 20:28:39 I love the stocks that can greatly benefit from crypto but also have their own sustainable/profitable operations aside such as $SQ.
666 2018-01-04 20:28:36 @rini6 "The happiest business in all the world is that of making friends; and no investment on the street pays larger dividends, for life is more than stocks and bonds, and love than rate percent, and she who gives in friendship's name shall reap what he/she has spent."

667 2018-01-04 20:28:25 Wouldn’t touch any weed stocks right now. Blood in the streets
668 2018-01-04 20:28:18 Remember don't give into FOMO on stocks like $CNET, if you are consistently walking away with profits you are part of the 10%!!
669 2018-01-04 20:28:15 Out of all the North American #MarijuanaStocks tracked by @MarijuanaIndex, only ONE is actually GREEN right now.

Thanks, #JeffSessions!
670 2018-01-04 20:27:57 $LG.v $LG holding up! Nice to see considering most pot stocks are down today, I’m thinking people are starting to recognize the Value of being a global player  The potential here is mind blowing

674 2018-01-04 20:25:41 Is @jeffsessions going to crash the marijuana stocks? I'm sure he can be bought off

676 2018-01-04 20:25:16 Anyone with a 401K owns stocks. That's a long was from MOST Einstein.
677 2018-01-04 20:24:48 Is there any reason why stocks of companies shouldn’t be tokenized?
678 2018-01-04 20:24:46 Heavy stuff: The CEO of #Intel sold 80% of his #stocks (US$ 25 million) in November 2017 - The fact that Intel has a #security issue was known for 6 months by insiders only! #HackerNews #Compliance #Stocks
679 2018-01-04 20:24:26 Some Rules which kept me alive:
1. avoid shorting float rotation stocks (low float) on day 1
2. avoid shorting strong stocks late day
3. leave midday if u must to avoid the grind
4. when shorting, stop out on high of day break
680 2018-01-04 20:24:13 Didn't you say say all your stocks last Jan.? So many people glad they didn't listen to you
681 2018-01-04 20:24:00 And thats the rub. People like you just don't care about the majority of the people of this country, who don't have any stocks.
682 2018-01-04 20:23:10 Hey JT...are you guys focused on stocks as well as options?
683 2018-01-04 20:23:02 Started a position in $SGDH and $PNTV today.

685 2018-01-04 20:22:50 If using #NPD stocks that did not survive have a date beside the symbol. The date is the day it became delisted. You’ll be amazed as to how many there are, thousands. Do not use data with #SurvivorshipBias
686 2018-01-04 20:22:32 They're about to roll up legal weed and the only thing getting high in these Sessions are private prison stocks.
687 2018-01-04 20:22:23 We already have the wheels in motion :)
688 2018-01-04 20:22:04 S’entraîner avec des mecs ultra stocks comme Killian c’est un rêve qui s’est réalisé
689 2018-01-04 20:21:44 You also didn’t mention anything positive about investing in stocks/index funds. NO maintanance. Unlike with housing where you have to hope renters aren’t deadbeats and don’t destroy your home.
690 2018-01-04 20:21:42 I also want to learn more about stocks and investments.
691 2018-01-04 20:21:12 $CNET the kind of stocks that can change your account for the better or the worst. Unreal. Lot of people got destroyed shorting this today. Sad.
692 2018-01-04 20:20:57 Near midday, MBS lower though off worst levels. Stocks holding solid gains. 10-yr yield 2.45% after hitting 2.48% this morning.
693 2018-01-04 20:20:55 Donald J. Trump Tweets:
Dow just crashes through 25,000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.

"crashes?" 

Is this a Freudian slip?

Donald Trump must own stocks because he keeps pumping the stock market. 

Pump and dump?
694 2018-01-04 20:20:21 I haven't read the paper so don't know how they account for that. But perhaps the argument is that rents are a bigger payoff for homes than dividends are for stocks? But I'm guessing.
695 2018-01-04 20:20:08 Healthcare companies stocks have quadrupled under the ACA and they still receive billions in subsidies.
696 2018-01-04 20:20:03 The policy of being too cautious is the greatest risk of all. #forex #stocks
697 2018-01-04 20:18:55 In the long run I think this will be an inflection point in security/architecture/ systems integration assumptions. In the short run I foresee a run on stocks of caffeinated products and antacids.
698 2018-01-04 20:18:17 the stock market is doing so well, i don`t even own any stocks and i`m making money
699 2018-01-04 20:17:46 Hes waiting for confirmation on the 3 stocks he just listed. If bullish. Keep. If bearish. Sell
700 2018-01-04 20:17:41 The majority of American's don't own any stocks.
The top 10% of American's by wealth own about 80% of stocks.
Big Corps will not expand, nor hire more people without the demand for it.

703 2018-01-04 20:17:06 All pot stocks down
704 2018-01-04 20:16:54 I did a milder version of what @paulypilot did,it went great until it turned into a frantic struggle to liquidate stocks for cash to prop up illiquid SB holdings, felt like opening a door into the teeth of a gale, I’ve one tiny residual account to remind me of the bad choices 
705 2018-01-04 20:16:45 $CNET $10.30 wouldn't hold o/n IMO
706 2018-01-04 20:15:30 It’s pretty easy to see that the guy who owns the stocks is going to contribute to the net wealth far more than some speaking fees.
707 2018-01-04 20:15:13 You can't be serious! Stocks are up unemployment down ISIS on the run. Thanks to Trump. North Korea wants talks with south Korea, thanks Trump. Obama was a bitch to the real world.
708 2018-01-04 20:15:13 Just by looking around stocks 
709 2018-01-04 20:14:41 Fantastic. We can thank Jeff Sessions for $INSY and many other cannabis related stocks tanking. God knows the "evil" pot companies trump corruption and genuine criminal behavior from the previous administration. Moron. I NEVER liked him.
710 2018-01-04 20:14:36 Made a quick $250 in the past 30 minutes in stocks. I'm still shaking wooo that was fun 
711 2018-01-04 20:14:30 I ain't one to get super political on Twitter...But this is all I see Republicans do now adays, they drone on and on about state rights and 'MERICA' until they lose profits. Jeff Sessions owns stocks in privately owned prison complexes. Coincidence?
712 2018-01-04 20:14:15 Great news especially that I own no stocks. let's change it for 2018. 
Relevant hard working folks who do these games either by marketing, or catering, or ticket scanners, or security, or cooks, or severs, or prepares, or parking attendants have nothing to do w/it work pay-check
713 2018-01-04 20:14:04 End of the business cycle. It’s amazing that the market is still rising because the amount of years in a row that the S&P and Dow have seen growth is unheard of. Some say its a super super cyle and this is all due to Trump’s policies. Expectations are bringing stocks higher.
714 2018-01-04 20:14:00 I think INTC should be today’s StupidStock move since company came out right away and said no financial burden for chip flaw. Retail stocks just profit taking after run up.

719 2018-01-04 20:13:10 Lots of stocks been fighting their way back up.  $N has been beaten down over and over the last few days but keeps clawing back.  $SX just brushes of the attacks and powers up.  LOVE IT
720 2018-01-04 20:12:57 The Dow is 30 stocks you half wit
721 2018-01-04 20:12:26 Have you read all 500 plus pages of the tax code. I bet not. The Dow is over 25,000.00.   I hope you have some stocks or 401K. Enjoy your blessings.
722 2018-01-04 20:11:46 Go to sleep Babe!  I want this tho 
723 2018-01-04 20:11:42 I personally have only invested in #MedicalCannabis stocks.
724 2018-01-04 20:11:30 No Alan...He's not...he falls into the fake it till you can't hide your lies anymore. I would definitely be cashing out my stocks and saving it for the crashy day

726 2018-01-04 20:10:33 I’m quit buying materialistic shit and buy stocks and bonds

728 2018-01-04 20:10:28 Must be nice if you own stocks!
729 2018-01-04 20:10:04 Is there anywhere in the city centre that stocks Keep Cups (or something similar)? Determined to reduce my use of throw away coffee cups & water bottles this year. Already had a lovely water bottle for Christmas, now need something for coffee. #cardiff
730 2018-01-04 20:09:51 I've decided the best way for me to iron out my punish game is to pick a threat character, set stocks to 10 and give myself 4 then 3 then 2 minutes to end all 10 enemy stocks. FINAL LAP. HURRY UP!

736 2018-01-04 20:07:18 You need to fire Sessions NOW! Invested in pot stocks Friday heavy, I’m now on life support. Plus this whole Comey, Mueller recusal, and Rosenstein sitting in the catbird seat to screw you! Republicans like me are NOT HAPPY.
737 2018-01-04 20:06:39 Logically #Sessions can't stop the #LegalMarijuana train. It's too big now and has too much momentum. The best action we can take is to invest more and push harder. Let's send pot stocks to the moon and show them what we think.
$HPNN $AZFL $HEMP
738 2018-01-04 20:06:13 A direct result of todays decision against legal marijuana. Pot stocks were doing great until today. Great job on your manipulation of the stock market for approval ratings and dirty $, @realDonaldTrump. Maybe get positive results without taking away from something else, @POTUS.
739 2018-01-04 20:05:58 Jeff Sessions is really fucking around with marijuana stocks today. I wish he had kept his Keebler Elf mouth shut.
740 2018-01-04 20:05:28 So pretty but where is money sobs.
741 2018-01-04 20:04:59 My brother gave me stocks for Christmas and wow I have no life now
742 2018-01-04 20:04:46 He did damage to the weed stocks.. Maybe he meant it so he can buy some.. 
743 2018-01-04 20:04:30 He just loves the $$$$ it will bring from his stocks.

745 2018-01-04 20:04:23 Better see who in the administration recently shorted marijuana stocks.
746 2018-01-04 20:04:07 Jeff Sessions dropped a "buzzkill" on shares of cannabis stocks today
747 2018-01-04 20:03:18 Melissa pay attention. Last week POTUS said "TaxCut is for his rich friends". He asked them to thank him. So only the 1%ers confidence is high. Companies will use the TaxCut to buyback stocks/pay more dividends & stash cash. No new factories, no pay raises without layoffs.
748 2018-01-04 20:03:09 if legislation is passed that marijuana is only legal in a prescribed drug format then yes doctors will be writing scripts by the hundreds of millions so yes investors would buy such stocks.
749 2018-01-04 20:03:02 $CNET will it push above the $10 mark? YES or NO?

756 2018-01-04 20:00:28 They're not the same. Dot-com stocks circa 2000 were definitely in a bubble. Some of the stocks (Enron) were outright scams. But many (eBay, Amazon) had underlying value. It's just that valuations had way outpaced that value.

772 2018-01-04 19:56:28 Stocks stinking today bro
773 2018-01-04 19:55:49 @lookner The stock market is raging. Many of those stocks are from Marijuana industry.
774 2018-01-04 19:55:44 So it’s the degree of income? Most folks who have savings make interest income. It’s effectively the same as stocks....which is actually riskier.
775 2018-01-04 19:55:39 Open a low interest money market account if you sell and need a safe place to store your investment. Very few companies split stocks anymore and the Obama days are officially over....it’s all on Cheeto now
776 2018-01-04 19:55:18 Marijuana stocks may tun out to be a good buy at some point, cuz Trump is not going to win the long term game on this one. It's prohibition all over again.
777 2018-01-04 19:54:20 Guess how they gained a lot of that wealth?....THEY BOUGHT STOCKS!
778 2018-01-04 19:54:17 $ES_F $SPY Today is not the day to be looking for new long positions/stocks - wait for a pull back - its healthy and price needs it - we will see what the next bear cycle will be (either strong or weak) - it will either last 1 day or 3

780 2018-01-04 19:53:24 I feel like this will be why the GOP allows trump to fire Jeff sessions. This is dangerous even though I know the Perjury General profits from this move because of his stocks in private prisons
781 2018-01-04 19:53:00 There are a finite amount of a lot of the crypto currencies and to say that there isn’t just proves you haven’t done any research on the topic at all!
Just like stocks, do your due diligence and make your decisions on which ones u c have value going forward..
782 2018-01-04 19:52:52 My concern with $weed and other weed stocks is that @JustinTrudeau flipflops on legalization due to Federal law in States and #nafta complications if Canada does legalize. So, in many ways, CDN weed stocks have US exposure.
783 2018-01-04 19:52:39 Hum he accounted for.....stocks up, border crossings down, deregulation, tax cuts, bonuses, isis finally feeling the pain...
784 2018-01-04 19:52:07 Do you have a WAN account? How do you make them work for you. Does it mention investing in the stocks of that company?

788 2018-01-04 19:51:52 You do realize the Dow is only 30 stocks out of 2,800 trading on the NYSE right? And any of those 30 stocks can be replaced at anytime if they are not performing. The Dow is a meaningless measurement of the economy.
789 2018-01-04 19:51:43 Cotton remains firm on demand, declining world stocks & large mill short. Be looking at Dec18 to net 75+.

791 2018-01-04 19:50:40 If I only new what this is all about I tried to invest in anything to save my house and family but I tried pot stocks which really didn’t work now the stocks are going but I got out and trying this  all I can do is pray now
792 2018-01-04 19:50:37 What moron uses the word “crashes” when referring to the Dow?  Oh yeah, our moronic @POTUS!  This only matters to the rich and upper middle. The rest don’t own stocks moron!!!  #ImpeachTrump the MORON!!!

795 2018-01-04 19:50:10 If you have an active sell order in they cannot borrow your shares to play against you. This is what I was told and will do to all my stocks whether or not it is truth I don't know but I will do it. Why not? If they start covering it can create a short squeeze and pressure
796 2018-01-04 19:49:40 @stocks_allison
797 2018-01-04 19:48:37 Can we peak at Sessions stocks/investment and find bias toward the Alcohol biz?
798 2018-01-04 19:48:21 Rep Company is a great idea; so many acting icons started off in Rep and sadly we just don’t have the same kind of structure anymore.
799 2018-01-04 19:46:37 Are you still in TLOU? Btw potential cannot be found on a balance sheet and it's the biggest driver of value for pre-revenue growth stocks. If all goes to plan this will breeze past £100mcap ;-)

804 2018-01-04 19:45:54 Trump will be the only President who will positively impact my life. Trump continues increasing my stocks value and lowering my taxes while Obama forced me to pay tens of thousands of dollars in health care and literally had as much debt as every president combined.
805 2018-01-04 19:45:50 It was a great 2017 for stocks, with record high after record high and an enviable string of gains in every month of the year for the first time ever. While there is still some gas left in the tank, technical analysis reveals some issues that should give one pause.
806 2018-01-04 19:44:58 the Dow Jones is NOT an indicator of economic health!  on the contrary, high stocks could mean bad times ahead.
807 2018-01-04 19:44:45 I have a small 401-k from work. They shifted something around 2 yrs ago, and now I'm getting less than I used to, despite the rising Dow. Not winning for me. Also, stocks aren't the economy!
808 2018-01-04 19:44:44 When I was a kid the Orioles dominated...Then Chambliss homered...Then life was awesome...Then Thurman died...Then we got beat by KC & LA...Then it all went dark for 15 years...Mattingly's prime wasted...We were laughing stocks unable to spend our way out of a wet paper bag...

821 2018-01-04 19:42:03 But why choose the Dow to measure stocks? Why on earth would you do that?
822 2018-01-04 19:41:54 Fair enough lol  alot damn easier to get into than stocks.

839 2018-01-04 19:36:21 I can't advise you my friend, talk to a friend/relative who invests in stocks if you ar ea pure beginner, or go to your bank advisor

843 2018-01-04 19:35:20 If I'm looking for a bright side in all this nonsense.  I now look like a genius for my decision sell all my marijuana stocks back on the 2nd.

874 2018-01-04 19:25:51 And having money in the bank doesn't make you a capitalist. The income you make off of stocks, your employees, or machines is capitalist. And you can still make that operation as ethical as possible, but ultimately one day, when the bank loans are paid off,
875 2018-01-04 19:25:41 You must be a new investor so I'm going to give you some advice, don't buy tops, buy bottoms (currently ltc). A lot of this volume in alts is from people who are new and want to accumulate cheap coins. That's as risky as buying big into penny stocks if you ask me.
876 2018-01-04 19:25:35 Welp time to buy these oil company stocks bro @teamASAP

883 2018-01-04 19:22:40 @realDonaldTrump , @PressSec , and the rest of this administration. STOP LYING AND MISLEADING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! TAX SCAM, GIVE OBAMA HIS PROPS! Stocks have been on the rise since the recession and that is NOT because of Trump! Christians are not supposed to be dishonest!
884 2018-01-04 19:22:36 3/ Stocks are over-valued. Both the in the US & UK, stocks are overpriced. Profit / Earning ratios are getting ridiculous again, like they did leading up to the 08 crisis.
885 2018-01-04 19:22:28 It only impacts the 18% who have some form of their wealth in stocks. But it is amazing how many drumpfers who don't have a pot to piss in will cite the stock market as evidence of drump's success. Has anything trickled down to the steel or mining belts yet? Just saying
886 2018-01-04 19:22:28 Stocks turn lower in a major way: Sometimes in advance of recession. Other times during recession. Other times no recession.

892 2018-01-04 19:20:58 Weed companies are not legit unless medical based and or until a full federal approval. Been in Washington where its been legal now a while.  Just because a dispensary makes a lot of sales it is not reflected into the financials of the business because its not fed regulated.
893 2018-01-04 19:20:46 My da and ate invested 300 euros last year. Idk how it really works. It’s like bitcoin/stocks.

923 2018-01-04 19:10:08 There are more people in this country that can't afford stocks than ppl who can.  I can't wait for the crash, won't affect me at all.
924 2018-01-04 19:09:51 1. Bar code = 00306270; 2. Lewisham but doubt it stocks them; Sydenham was where I checked to see if it was with the meats; 3. Chilled veggie foods rare in Lewisham though frozen OK. Freefrom have loads. Vegans have almost none.
925 2018-01-04 19:09:27 Also, iirc there was something in the tax bill that means you'd be taxed on the value of the stocks you can't even exercise yet (or ever). Not sure of that stayed in or not.
926 2018-01-04 19:09:13 You are a fool if you think trump being president has anything to do with stocks going up or down  typical trumpster .. ignorant
927 2018-01-04 19:08:56 So, regarding our wild stocks of Salmon and Sea Trout can you please tell me what's being done to combat their decline in relation tae fish farming? I've only asked ye six times to date.. Saor Alba..
928 2018-01-04 19:08:49 Most people don't have stocks, nor do they own their own business. I guess that you're not really that bothered about your fellow Americans?
929 2018-01-04 19:08:34 Where's that tweet from that super-smart editor guy who said he cashed in all his stocks because of @realDonaldTrump might have win?

931 2018-01-04 19:08:07 The wealthiest 10% own nearly 90% of stocks, the highest such ratio since 1983.
932 2018-01-04 19:08:05 Should I invest more in dollars, gold or try stock? I need advice cos I have basic knowledge on stocks, still learning. Gold seems cool and all just pretty scary and dollar so far its good its just too easy to convert if I wanna shop or travel lmao #lowselfcontrol #espforfood
933 2018-01-04 19:07:57 If you want to stop unnecessary regulations, tell your buddy Jeff to back off of legal marijuana. It's no worse than booze. He is killing my weed stocks!
934 2018-01-04 19:07:45 A few losses today.  Some intraday challenges ahead of NFP for #forex. A good week for #stocks & #futures #trading
935 2018-01-04 19:07:00 @realDonaldTrump Markets would soar higher if you can get Sessions to back off cannabis & their stocks! #moneytobemade
936 2018-01-04 19:06:56 Compared to what? Housing prices circa 2006? Dot-com stocks around 2000? Tulip prices in early 1637?
937 2018-01-04 19:06:56 @Dunnswholesale Evening. Can you tell me of anywhere in either Barrhead or Glasgow city centre that stocks Dunsade? Or can I buy it directly?
938 2018-01-04 19:06:35 Really appreciate all your tweets! Love all my FANG stocks + $NVDA + $MSFT. Should be FANNMG really...

940 2018-01-04 19:05:41 So are the fish coming into the stocks. Yes, but many have already been in safe stocks with good dividends...now they will look to Fusion Golden Butterflies. AAII Bulls finally went over 50.. but still early speculation..
941 2018-01-04 19:05:32 Spring Bulbs now Half Price  only 50p and 2018 Calendars Still Available, while stocks Last. 
942 2018-01-04 19:05:17 Jeff Sessions is only making it so that stocks like @ianthuscapital $IAN.v can trade for pennies on the dollar... Such a great opportunity for Canadian retail investors....  The smart money is on the sidelines waiting to get in...

948 2018-01-04 19:04:08 Time to buy stocks in Just For Men.
949 2018-01-04 19:04:07 What do you mean over all or pot stocks
950 2018-01-04 19:04:06 Hmmm... interesting reversal here. These stocks, like GROW and GCAP can be very tricky
951 2018-01-04 19:03:53 @AndrewBellBNN  your guest today David Baskin is so ignorant on marijuana stocks. You can't grow premium pot in your backyard. Look at liquor/wine/beer you can make that at home but people who want good product have been paying top dollar across our country for years!
952 2018-01-04 19:03:42 @WolfOfWeedST Tell them to buy #water stocks. I just bought some and i bought some #paper #stocks along with the #china #railroads stocks #monoploy I am buying #aircraft and #areospace #stocks AND #DEFENCE STOCKS NOW

956 2018-01-04 19:03:18 I worked for the NYSE Stocks rose when President Trump was elected. The market knows exactly what is going on. We are making money on our 401k
957 2018-01-04 19:03:11 All my savings are currently in US Stocks, cause I bet that @realDonaldTrump has only rolled back one of his shirts sleeves yet. #MAGA @POTUS #Regulations #TaxCutsandJobsAct #Economic growth #DowJones
958 2018-01-04 19:02:50 Think about how much dark money is about to be exposed throughout the WORLD and how much Bitcoins have been shoved in our faces. Beware folks and let us not forget the giant tax cut that helped mainly those who helped themselves in stocks.
959 2018-01-04 19:02:39 doesn't the demon elf own stocks or something in prisons? He wont get paid if they cant jail for owning/selling weed.
960 2018-01-04 19:00:36 Expanding offshore drilling the same week I invest in 3 oil/gas stocks is a big win.
961 2018-01-04 19:00:23 <well, if your waiting for probabilities to become facts, you shouldn't be in any stocks at all.>
FYI, contrary, I already have (from 1996)  2 100-bagger (CELG, REGN)  in bio-stocks! And very few debacles (serious loss). You?

964 2018-01-04 18:59:16 Over valuation of pot stocks could see a 60% pull back and unfortunate but even with the roll-out of public buying Canabis over the counter, people will most likely try and get a prescription because they kick back on medical expenses

967 2018-01-04 18:58:28 You're the leftist hack who told people to sell their stocks. Why would anyone believe you about, well, anything?
968 2018-01-04 18:58:13 Pilots have routines/checklists. Pilots know WHAT they'll do before something happens. They PRACTICE what to do if something happens. (We should do the same.) #stocks
969 2018-01-04 18:58:12 And not only that, the DOW average is just THIRTY stocks, and MUCH of the recent boost is attributable to ONE stock... BOEING. 
So if you own Boeing stock, great. If you are like 57% of Americans that own no stock, sorry...
970 2018-01-04 18:58:02 @realDonaldTrump could you tell @USAGSessions to lighten up on the weed issue. I just bought into an international marijuana ETF. Let's make weed stocks great again, shall we? @hmlsf
971 2018-01-04 18:57:23 Just to really perfect everything i had in my mind, and honestly the effects of designing literally an ad or a header in one day can be seen easily in your designs, very harsh cc sometimes, unnecessary stocks that dont make sense and not a lot of thinking with color and cc
972 2018-01-04 18:57:17 $VIX up, $UVXY down... Today's a pretty good example of why you shouldn't buy UVXY / $TVIX / $VXX even when the VIX is low. #stockmarket #stocks #investing #finance $SPY $QQQ $DIA $DJIA $IWM $TLT $EEM
973 2018-01-04 18:56:59 Bump stocks are a small price to pay for the restoration of phrenology (and its even more eccentric heir, phrenomagnetism) to the status of crown jewel of all sciences. Back when the sciences could still consist largely of ad hoc racialized superstitions and nobody balked much.
974 2018-01-04 18:56:42 Awesome, What platform do u use on cryptos and positions on conventional stocks

976 2018-01-04 18:55:51 I wonder how bad the weed stocks will get if Sessions does get his wish.
977 2018-01-04 18:55:38 Rules. Rules help us. They guide us to get in a stock. They guide us to ride trends. They guide us to sell some. They guide us to limit losses. #stocks
978 2018-01-04 18:55:29 The ONLY ones who benefit by stocks going up are the same corporations that benefited from tax cuts... oh and Republican Congress & Trump. Trickle down doesn’t work! VOTE FOR WOMEN & JULIA PEACOCK @peacock4ca42 #PeacockforCongress #BlueWaveIsComing
979 2018-01-04 18:55:27 Plenty of cash going into stocks because Obama made the economy STRONG with great growth potential.....infrastructure will make jobs....corps have lots of cash already.  #GOPtaxScam will increase national debt (period).  @HarvardHBS

982 2018-01-04 18:54:08 The way stocks have been performing in 2017 and into 2018, one can safely say that FOMO is not limited to Bitcoin & crypto currencies
983 2018-01-04 18:54:04 Jeff Sessions fucking up my stocks in weed
984 2018-01-04 18:54:00 I remember there was a single desktop black phone on the desk that we used to call a Dimensional Funds.  We'd suction cup the headset to a device that looked like a typewriter to print a list of stocks they would buy or sell.
985 2018-01-04 18:53:45 well, if you're waiting for probabilities to become facts, you shouldn't be in any stocks at all. You should just stick to t-bills, but there you have sovereign risk so maybe that's not for you either!

988 2018-01-04 18:52:35 Useless letter. By the way, always ASK a question the needs a response. Like: "What is your position on banning bump stocks after the horrific mass shooting in Las Vegas?"
989 2018-01-04 18:52:28 That's fair, and I was imprecise in my wording.  But to me, it is just another (albeit poor) way of gauging enthusiasm for 'celebrity stocks,' whether for investment purposes or general interest (to your point, probably more the latter).
990 2018-01-04 18:52:14 Isn't anything legal in the US? E.g. Intel CEO @bkrunner puts the world at risk and sells all of his own Intel Insider stocks - why shouldn't we do so ?

997 2018-01-04 18:50:59 No kidding. Remember the baby milk adulterated with melamine? And it's not a new phenomenon - eg: Victorian bakers added all sorts of weird things to bread to stretch their flour stocks, til the gov't caught on.
998 2018-01-04 18:50:26 Barely one-third of families in the bottom 50% of earners own stocks, according to the Fed. On the other hand, nearly 94% of the top income group owned stocks in 2016.

Safe bet says he got payed and he and his  have or will have Prison stocks in their portfolios shortly.
1038 2018-01-04 18:39:01 Which Marijuana stocks do you like?
1039 2018-01-04 18:38:41 Doubt Trump will, unless he notices how it is affecting stocks, and tax revenue... otherwise he will likely let Jeff Sessions run with his anti marijuana crusade.
1040 2018-01-04 18:38:22 The biggest part of investing/trading is not what's before our eyes. It's what's between our ears. #stocks
1041 2018-01-04 18:38:06 Sessions is not about “states rights”+denying rights to blacks because there are many more white marijuana users then there are black marijuana users. And I think it is way more likely that it is because of stocks he owns or money he receives from drug and prison companies.
1042 2018-01-04 18:37:42 I love it MAGA= Make America Gawdy Again..Trumps mantra..Gold drapes, gold coin,Tax plan that makes Stocks and Big companies like Trump Co worth More Gold! What a joke..Trump is making the US a laughing stock by his Gilded leaf life style and Gold standard taz plans

1048 2018-01-04 18:35:11 there's a case to be made that legal pot hurts poor communities because why buy from small dude on the street when you can buy from big guy in the shop? Black market has a DOW too! and Jeff Sessions just influenced illegal pot stocks.

@Oreo stocks plummet.
1052 2018-01-04 18:34:51 Took plenty of profits on U.S. marijuana stocks today. I might regret that, because now they're bouncing. And Canadian pot stocks are bouncing even harder. I didn't sell any of those. Sessions' stubby little arms can't reach over the border.

1061 2018-01-04 18:32:24 It seems #Intel and its CEO got big errors! The company for hiding and not fixing (yet) a system vulnerability and the CEO for selling shares during that time and knowing about the issue. #technology #stocks

1070 2018-01-04 18:30:40 If stocks are just 'one example', why is POTUS using it as his only metric for success, versus the majority of Americans, who don't actually have any stocks? But hey they got a +-$100 tax break per month, so there's always that. Also, #ThanksObama
1071 2018-01-04 18:30:01 My #cannabis stocks are a bloodbath today!
1072 2018-01-04 18:30:00 Can only think they have doubled down on 'clean-up' company stocks to benefit from the inevitable disaster.
We the people will respond by doubling down on donations & support to organizations that agree with the majority in opposing this insanity.

1074 2018-01-04 18:29:53 That IPO is tiny compared to the @Ripple revolution. I've not been this excited since @BloombergTV dot-com days of Amazon at $10ish. These currencies dwarfing stocks...with good reason with @Google and @a16z behind them.
1075 2018-01-04 18:29:37 Time to get out of weed stocks and buy private prison stock?
1076 2018-01-04 18:29:16 People need to invest in $acol because this company does not rely on US politics. This company has a HUGE presence in Canada and marijuana becomes legal this year for the entire country. Do you research and stop stressing. This company is global unlike the other marijuana stocks!

1079 2018-01-04 18:28:48 People let's not get excited about the Dow being up...first Obama had higher numbers but that doesn't matter, the Dow does NOT equate to the economy plus if you don't own stocks it means nothing for your life. Pay attention, companies getting big tax breaks are laying off workers
1080 2018-01-04 18:28:47 Jobs lowers criminal activity. With less crime smaller government. Democrats are furious their private prison stocks will go down the first time since Clinton had 100 new prisons built for crackheads created with Mena airport scandal.
1081 2018-01-04 18:28:31 UNHUNH! Why not make the distinction of the differences between stocks? R shades of gradation passé?

1095 2018-01-04 18:25:05 When stocks go up, its the government's great "achievement" when it goes down, it's always someone else's fault.

1115 2018-01-04 18:19:31 Greetings, Jim! Your segment on Dogs of the Dow hit hard: GE, VZ, XOM had, for decades, been tried&true, “safe” stocks to accumulate for us retirees, dividends. Do you think they will regain luster? Hate to sell; still hold certs. Thx
1116 2018-01-04 18:19:29 Or, in FoxSpeak, "AG Jeff Sessions unleashes prosecutors on Obama-era pot policies. Marijuana stocks plummet as Obama-era rule goes up in smoke". Of course, not one of Dear Leader's 63 million fans uses (or has used) marijuana.
1117 2018-01-04 18:19:01 I don't know why anyone would take Eichenwald's word for anything. He's the genius that sold his stocks in a fit of TDS before the market soared.

1127 2018-01-04 18:17:07 Alright, let me rephrase this clearly.

The global money supply is estimated to be 90 trillions (1 trillion = 10^12)
Total value of all global assets in the world including stocks, debt, real  estate, derivatives, etc. is estimated in the quadrillion range (1 quadrillion = 10^15)
1128 2018-01-04 18:16:43 Thanks C I know some people are thinking what's so special about $ENR, I mean it will show up on any gap scanner but AJ picks these specific stocks for a reason and if he likes it then I like it.

1129 2018-01-04 18:16:19 While everyone in the country that doesn't have major stock options shrugged and wondered why the fuck we're supposed to care? Stocks don't mirror life. Life requires more than hot air to thrive.

1153 2018-01-04 18:12:39 You need to understand the difference between correlation and causality. World stocks are up even higher, so Trump claims causality where one can only state correlation.

1185 2018-01-04 18:04:23 You believed Jefferson “I cannot recaw” Sessions? Wow! Talk about gullible. Bet he can’t recall any commitments he made to you. 

Any response yet, to your constituents on bump stocks and security checks after the Vegas Massacre? Or don’t you recall those letters?
1186 2018-01-04 18:04:19 I'm surprised that anyone still stocks physical PC games TBH
1187 2018-01-04 18:04:15 Idea for free - buy up all these marijuana stocks today while they're cheap. Build an empire and use the profits to employ and bail out people in prison for minor drug offenses.
1188 2018-01-04 18:04:12 Not to mention avg American's pensions are tied up in the stock market.  Liberals forget to tell everyone that it's everyday Americans who own these companies thru their stocks.  Unfortunately @NancyPelosi & @SenSchumer know their base is uneducated and will believe anything
1189 2018-01-04 18:03:28 My stocks were up last two days, now dropping fast after his little announcement. Don’t think he can make it stick.
1190 2018-01-04 18:03:25 i would have went this way
25% My Buddies Start Up
25% XIV
25% Weed Stocks
instead of 20% gold and 5% silver
20% Bitcoin 5% Ethereum
1191 2018-01-04 18:03:13 I believe they will try but the cannabis entrepreneurs in states like California and Colorado will hold the ground and not fold under the pressure from the federal government. And from an investment standpoint The Canadian stocks have lots of upside potential.
1192 2018-01-04 18:03:01 Are stocks gambling as well?
1193 2018-01-04 18:02:31 Sessions owns stocks in private prisons.
1194 2018-01-04 18:02:29 $uav moving up bids moving up to looks like its getting noticed
1195 2018-01-04 18:02:29 It’s funny how business people are scared of marijuana but marijuana people aren’t scared of business. Every time Jeff has a bitch fit stocks go weird and scared people bail out...lol welcome to the wonderful world of #cannabis
1196 2018-01-04 18:02:15 Just invested in stocks for the first time. Not sure if a mistake or not.
1197 2018-01-04 18:01:42 2017 wasn't the best but we sold out most of our stuff with no ads, website, store stocks, but IG posts. 

you gotta say we make a case as one of the top brands in Philly!

1199 2018-01-04 18:01:25 Stocks is really the best thing you could invest into 
1200 2018-01-04 18:01:17 the main question for me, where this oil undersupplied to US. similar magnitude falling of production wasn't observed, as well as growth in internal consumption. Partially oil export migrated to export of oil products. Where the rest? In their own stocks?
1201 2018-01-04 18:01:00 MJ stocks on sale today, buy the dip. Grabbed $ACOL and $BUDZ and looking for more.
1202 2018-01-04 18:00:45 Spain stocks higher at close of trade; IBEX 35 up 1.96%
1203 2018-01-04 18:00:36 France stocks higher at close of trade; CAC 40 up 1.55%
1204 2018-01-04 18:00:36 Great, I’m sure the 48% of Americans who own stocks are jubilant. Wait, 10% richest own 84% of stocks
1205 2018-01-04 18:00:33 @JeannieLee88 Would be interesting if someone did story on connection between big banks and Cannabis companies. Every time the stocks plummet TD and Royal trading accounts falter. When everyone is buying on large volume, the system works perfectly - hmmm.
1206 2018-01-04 17:59:48 buying stocks in some of these companies... snatchies I NEED THAT
1207 2018-01-04 17:59:47 Yes! I'm used to making stocks and dressings because I'm vegan! What recipe are you referring to? The shrimp gumbo one?
1208 2018-01-04 17:59:27 ...you have been listening to recent conversations by several expert economists (which you are not) about the fear of an impending "bubble burst" with regard to stocks, correct?
1209 2018-01-04 17:59:22 Stocks usually go up after an election. So...
1210 2018-01-04 17:58:42 Oh really which stocks did you sell? How much did you make?

1213 2018-01-04 17:58:01 Since 1950, stocks have traded at an average multiple of 18.1 times earnings when inflation has ranged between 0% and 2% - @barronsonline
1214 2018-01-04 17:57:59 I did believe Cramer when he said Pipeline stocks would still make money if oil prices should fall. Cramer is pushing these stocks again.  I also remember the Najarians saying that "Sell in May and go away" would not be a good idea in 2008.
1215 2018-01-04 17:57:28 Some very good moves in financial stocks today.
1216 2018-01-04 17:57:28 pred hit 3. ment to u at 1.00 2 weeks ago
1217 2018-01-04 17:56:32 The vast majority of the benefits businesses  are receiving will be used for stock buybacks. The top 10% own 86% percent of all stocks.  

Stop trying to sell this as a good thing for the middle class. It’s not.
1218 2018-01-04 17:56:24 I try to do my research & pick coins with a strong team & technologies that I think will be the future.  XRP has been in the news a lot because several banks are in actual testing phases.  There are a lot of junk coins - just like junk stocks
1219 2018-01-04 17:56:13 great chart. do you have this as stocks instead of flows just to give a slightly different perspective/

1222 2018-01-04 17:55:50 Yeah but then there weren't nearly as many exchanges. Half the currencies also didn't develop till the past two years. People need to compare some of these currencies to penny stocks. Same thing different market
1223 2018-01-04 17:55:36 Why. Don't stocks.  Split. Is there a good reason.
1224 2018-01-04 17:55:26 Eat it Libturds! This has nothing to do with Barack Obama! He had a stock market that was so low when he took office it had no choice but to go up —-he had nothing to do with that either! Jealous much snowflakes? #stocks #StockMarket #DOW25K #MAGA2020 #ccot #TCOT #Trump
1225 2018-01-04 17:55:08 the market broke through 25k..I knew that was gonna happen. I need to start buying stocks man
1226 2018-01-04 17:53:47 He is shameful.  Just tanked my marijuana stocks!  So much winning
1227 2018-01-04 17:53:41 Y’all buying stuff you know nothing about. I been had stocks, it’s a marathon not a sprint.
1228 2018-01-04 17:53:33 Thanks guys 4 all the effort u have put in all signings, we are no longer be a lough in stocks
1229 2018-01-04 17:53:26 Reports indicate stocks of 29 scam linked companies rise on acquittal; let us wait and watch what happens when CBI goes on appeal!!!
1230 2018-01-04 17:53:06 Cannabis related stocks are recovering after initial drops on DOJ news. Markets realizing that even if the US moves backward, the rest of the world is still moving forward.
1231 2018-01-04 17:53:02 ”Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea.” - Warren Buffett.

Me? I own stocks in 6 different companies. But I would have been much more successful adding to my 1/2/3.
1232 2018-01-04 17:52:58 A testament to why you don't marry stocks. I was nearly all cash going into today and it allowed me to buy (& subsequently sell) the dips on $ACB and $WEED.  Stay liquid my friends.  

Disclosure:  I am happily married in real life.  
$ACBFF $TWMJF $ACB.TO $WEED.TO
1233 2018-01-04 17:52:38 Lol!!!!! Liberal delusion. Yes ppl waited for O to leave the office to buy stocks at record numbers. In celebration of his being gone
1234 2018-01-04 17:52:30 I keep thinking the same thing. Maybe if Sessions owned pot stocks instead of shares in prisons he might feel differently.
1235 2018-01-04 17:52:02 I was talking to House Flippers a few days ago and they were all telling me to "get into weed stocks"
1236 2018-01-04 17:51:51 HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Take it from the guy who stocks his car with all kinds of stuff,,,wasn't in mine either, but concession stand food gets old,,,just like the drive-thru!
1237 2018-01-04 17:50:58 One could argue that the reason this administration is doing it is to increase the Pharmaceuticals profits. How many of the cabinet members would fair well of higher pharmaceutical stocks? Killing humans is still UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
1238 2018-01-04 17:50:55 What stocks caused the high? How did private prison stocks do, considering today’s news?
1239 2018-01-04 17:50:32 Not everyone can afford a lot of stocks though! People will need their social security more than ever!
1240 2018-01-04 17:50:20 How do i buy stocks in marijuana
1241 2018-01-04 17:50:10 .  This is to boost prison stocks $GEO $CXW
1242 2018-01-04 17:50:00 Still wonder if cybersecurity stocks can get going this year -- $PFPT, $PANW have tightened up, though not in uptrends. Worth keeping an eye on.
1243 2018-01-04 17:48:59 It’s like twitter for stocks etc
1244 2018-01-04 17:48:12 The hillbilly that made "80% off his stocks" this year.  Didn't like getting proven a liar, I guess.
1245 2018-01-04 17:48:09 Funny how the CIA is everywhere the problem is. Stocks for military procurement is way up, while the mainstream is mindlessly buying "paper gold" and  " barrels of oil".
1246 2018-01-04 17:47:13 The trend is always your friend. Buy the highs and buy the dips. There is no way back. Authorities will need to keep debasing fiat money which means all real assets will rise long term. The financialization and speculation mean real profits will lag,but stocks will rise nominally
1247 2018-01-04 17:47:01 Well that is true, but it isn’t close to the gain you would have made with bitcoin from just 2011 to now. It is getting annoying seeing it as a magic money maker cause it’s the same as stocks just way more risk. Especially with as popular as it has become and as dumb people are
1248 2018-01-04 17:46:32 @MariaBartiromo Just wanted to say I'm fan of your show, however I own 0 Stocks, I'm part of the group in the US with no 401K or IRA. Also I've never made a purchase nor am I a member of Amazon, what's wrong?
1249 2018-01-04 17:46:11 “The top 10% own more stocks than the bottom 90%” yeah makes sense why they’re in the top 10%. They own assets appreciating in value.
1250 2018-01-04 17:45:48 They always do this shit. Ralph Nader had stocks. Karl Marx owned a chair. 
It is so unfathomable to these shitheads that anyone actually believes in something that they are stuck analyzing their property.
1251 2018-01-04 17:45:24 $XSNX 0.0019 reversal off 0.0014 low
1252 2018-01-04 17:45:13 the only place you can really reliably find that stocks most titles is Amazon so yeah maybe its just a supply/demand issue
1253 2018-01-04 17:45:03 it sure is, but there's really no doubt about it bouncing back up and well beyond the highs that were recently set. They've got a very nice mining setup that is far superior to many other crypto plays that are currently stealing the spotlight. filings will take this back up
1254 2018-01-04 17:45:02 By far, most stocks are owned by the rich. Anyone surprised?
1255 2018-01-04 17:44:52 I wonder where sessions money comes from certainly he doesnt have stocks in big pharma
1256 2018-01-04 17:44:43 C'est effectivement long mais cela dépend de la fréquentation et des problématiques malheureusement.
Pour le stock de l'iPhone X, il est vrai que la demande est trés important et les stocks tendus ce qui implique des ruptures fréquentes.

1257 2018-01-04 17:44:32 And just for the record I predicted this would happened months ago and told my parents to absolutely not invest in pot stocks until way after Sessions, turned out I was right.

1261 2018-01-04 17:42:55 Simply because the stocks rose #cannabiscommunity think of the damage he’s trying to do to growers individually. Every bit of this is meaness & a waste of ALL of our time. There’s HAS to be a lawsuit, so now Court time taken away from serious trials. Yet no ones gonna do a thing.
1262 2018-01-04 17:42:28 Gambling on coins and stocks is a zero sum game, and 95% lose money.
1263 2018-01-04 17:42:00 Yeah but a lot of “naysayers” have made a fortune on short selling stocks, so they are not always wrong. I could probably find a ton of articles where they were right on overrated stocks.
1264 2018-01-04 17:41:39 Crazy. Gold firmed up after last nights selloff yet gold mining stocks continue to deteriorate. Went from 4 of 22 in stay long position but today we dropped another so now it's 3 of 22 or just 13%.  Keep it nimble

1271 2018-01-04 17:40:07 Jeff Sessions announces that he has massive shorts positions on marijuana stocks & long alcoholic drugs. I mean, don't touch US marijuana stocks. Easy advice knowing his views for past year. Going to be risky & volatile. Pot stocks may have to start adding blockchain to their PRs
1272 2018-01-04 17:40:00 Uh-oh. Five of the ten trending stocks trade under $10 and two are penny stocks. Danger.
1273 2018-01-04 17:39:57 According to Deutsche Bank data, provided by Yahoo finance, the richest 1% own 40% of stocks held by households. 
Households making over $250,000 own 60.5% of stocks held by households.
Just 25% of households own more than $25,000 worth of stocks. #stockwealth #wealthinequality
1274 2018-01-04 17:39:30 yes, the stocks are going very expensive, the riksk going by greater
1275 2018-01-04 17:39:02 Stupidity, venality and racism beyond belief...but it does help the private prison stocks!
1276 2018-01-04 17:38:56 The TSX traded cannabis stocks recovering very nicely.

1281 2018-01-04 17:38:27 The system is broke, not the people acting rationally within the system. You can't just expect people to be giving when that's explicitly not rewarded, or even punished in some cases cause of how stocks and boards of directors work.
1282 2018-01-04 17:38:24 What about bump stocks?
1283 2018-01-04 17:38:13 Do you believe stocks are "moved"? I have always believed that and people think I'm crazy
1284 2018-01-04 17:38:01 just realized going forward  canada weed stocks  are probably more legit than these scammy american ones. so   with that said they prob  will be dip buys forever.  would only cautiously short canada pot now

1291 2018-01-04 17:35:45 $1000 investment in these stocks 10 years ago would now be worth:

1300 2018-01-04 17:33:54 Yeah...from the trillions from the corporate tax break, more companies will buy back their own stocks & artificially inflate the DOW. For the common person, that matters little. For investors, it’s a good thing.
1301 2018-01-04 17:33:42 "Jeff Sessions" Thanks for killing my weed stocks!!  Down 20% across the board.
1302 2018-01-04 17:33:41 Just like Amazon stock before it, and tech stocks, and walmart stocks, and God knows what else.  Someone doesn't have to lose for you to win.  You just have to go win. Also, anyone all in on one coin is stupid and deserves to get hosed when it crashes.

1311 2018-01-04 17:32:08 By all, do you mean the 50% who own stocks? What about the other 50%. Oh, I forgot, Romney talked about those folks during his campaign.
1312 2018-01-04 17:31:58 Amazing what a day does. Yesterday all but 2 of the oil stocks I watch were still in a stay long position. Today even with oil higher. That stat has now changed only 17 of 35 stocks remain in Stay long position.  Or just 51% compared to 94% yesterday.  Tighten stops if long now

Alcohol is the far greater danger but they can't get past DuPont's propaganda film reefer madness. Tax it regulate it like alcohol, tobacco and make money.
1317 2018-01-04 17:30:26 I loaded up on 6 different pot stocks I’ve been following and was angry I didn’t buy sooner. This allowed me to buy at the prices I wanted. Some better than I wanted. This is a blip. That morons got no power.

1321 2018-01-04 17:29:41 The Dow's increase does mot mean a better economy. It just means that all the money printed by the Fed's QE is being used by the top 1% to buy overpriced stocks and bonds. Another economic bubble just like 2008. Is that what you want?
1322 2018-01-04 17:29:41 Fuck Jeff Sessions he ruined my stocks i have in weed today
1323 2018-01-04 17:29:17 Yeah, heck with the 54 million who own stocks/bonds.
1324 2018-01-04 17:29:10 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $LB, $WBA, $M, $FL, and $KR.
1325 2018-01-04 17:28:54 I’m going to repeat this again because I took economic courses stocks do not show how the American people are doing. You may be a small business but you are not the majority, you are the minority

1341 2018-01-04 17:25:31 Agreed that labor supply and demand governs wages, not the DJIA. However, stocks don’t just benefit fat cats. Anyone with a pension or IRA or 401k etc benefits. And saving? This is GOOD for the value of our currency. Saving money is a good thing.

1347 2018-01-04 17:24:11 @hainsworthtv Pot is a controlled substance at the Federal level in the US. The Obama edict about not enforcing it, was illegal as well. Constitutionally, #POTUS doesn't get to pick and choose what laws are enforced. He is required to uphold them all. Short your pot stocks now.
1348 2018-01-04 17:23:34 That’s BS.Many in poor counties (the forgotten) work hard at min/wage jobs that offer minimal to NO benefits such as 401k.These people can’t save; can’t buy stocks b/c they have to buy food, pay rent & electric, and there’s nothing left.Don’t degrade more with comments like this.
1349 2018-01-04 17:23:32 $INTV is the next $INTV play. Some nice slaps coming in now. hop in now at 2 bucks and ride it up into double digits!!!
1350 2018-01-04 17:23:24 @WarrenBuffett  Sir.. big fan
Do you recall, at any time in your past.. that you broke the conventional strategy and went with your gut feeling and picked up stocks..  #gutvsbrain..
1351 2018-01-04 17:23:16 Of course Seesions the morons wants to fill the prisions he owns stocks in!
1352 2018-01-04 17:23:14 The two stocks I regret buying the most are $VZ and $TSLA

VZ was an impulse buy with some left-over funds and I had not done proper market or company research.

TSLA I just don't know wtf just way messed up with some of my beginning swingtrades

$SMG good tho as sideways MJ play
1353 2018-01-04 17:23:14 Frig off, Donnie! Don't you mess with my weed stocks!
1354 2018-01-04 17:23:04 My boss started showing me some of his stocks how he invests and I’m super intrigued. I’ll start there. Thanks putito!
1355 2018-01-04 17:23:00 @realDonaldTrump My weed stocks were doing great until today. Was going to hire a contractor to redo my bathroom and kitchen. What happened to it being up to the states? Job killing move. Now I have to wait.
1356 2018-01-04 17:22:59 Newsflash: Trump is the one to join the Globalists  in the GOP,  with their tax bill for wealthy donors, He uses the stock market to say economy is great but 1/2 of all Americans have zero stocks
1357 2018-01-04 17:22:47 @Tesla How many stocks is must one own to be "an investor" for the purposes of jumping ahead in the Model 3 line?
1358 2018-01-04 17:22:44 No, it isn't. It's mostly rich guys making bets on how the stocks will do. It's got only a weak connection to how well companies are doing, and no connection at all to how well the normal citizen is doing.

Ah. So this means what for you?

1362 2018-01-04 17:22:21 Cannabis stocks getting rocked today
1363 2018-01-04 17:22:09 With stocks in private for profit prisons.
1364 2018-01-04 17:22:06 If oil goes up then Bad for stocks...
1365 2018-01-04 17:21:47 @jeffsessions Just another corporate sellout, padding his own stocks. Prove Hemp Seed couldn't save the world? You've been challenged boy! Time to put your money where your mouth is. I think you're full of it.
1366 2018-01-04 17:21:27 Marijuana related stocks and coins drop ?
1367 2018-01-04 17:21:12 I had been waiting for a little pullback to add shares to a few pot stocks, I guess today was that day. Happy camper.
1368 2018-01-04 17:21:08 Main Street doesn't own the top 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Cutting regulations helps those companies, because they can do whatever they want without repercussion.  That hurts Joe and Suzie Sixpack.  It helps Democrats with investments like me!
1369 2018-01-04 17:21:04 I've seen stocks go up 10000%. We are only at the beginning man.
1370 2018-01-04 17:20:44 Everyday there are going to be 10 different NEW Break out stocks...Dont get carried away, Opportunities will keep coming only if you stay in the market and that you can do only with capital protection. Trend is still bullish, but always stay Cautious.
1371 2018-01-04 17:20:42 He just hasn’t figured out how to profit from it yet, other than propping up his stocks in the for-profit prison system.
1372 2018-01-04 17:20:37 Nice pop on $DSX the last few days. Shipping stocks should be on watch. $DCIX maybe making a nice bottom? $DRYS and $TOPS on watch too
1373 2018-01-04 17:20:18 Stocks don’t show economy before the recession the stocks were skyrocketing to new heights too and that’s what lead to the recession
1374 2018-01-04 17:20:11 everyone in canada too fucking high  guess thats why these canada pot stocks dont go down.  fucking  crack heads
1375 2018-01-04 17:19:55 The more people and countries that divest the more likely it will stay in the ground. People don't like loosing stocks and when they see people divesting they consider it too.
1376 2018-01-04 17:19:30 Your policies may INDIRECTLY help the stock market go up. But touting a direct cause will only bite you. Just like fundamentally sound companies can see their stocks tank, so too will they on you. You've been warned!

1380 2018-01-04 17:18:22 I thought cannabis stocks were on the upswing, but they tanked today--at least mine did. Cmon California, show the US the way to legalization!
1381 2018-01-04 17:18:01 Criminalizing #marijuana is a low-resistance path to #prisonpipeline. #WallStreet and certain politicians/judges wants #ghanja to remain illegal. That theoretically keeps #privateprisons pipelines full. Wall Street stocks trade on bodies incarcerated by #prisonindustrialcomplex.
1382 2018-01-04 17:17:57 Man, I’m off the internet for a morning and my weed stocks go through the roof and Taylor Hall is a Sen. #Sens.
1383 2018-01-04 17:17:36 Most Americans will see no benefit from this!!! The richest 0.1% of Americans owns as much as the entire bottom 90%, a trend that has been accelerating since the mid-1980s. The wealthiest 10% own nearly 90% of stocks, the highest such ratio since 1983.
1384 2018-01-04 17:17:10 Marijuana stocks plunge on report of U.S. plans to end expansion policy.
Cannabis stocks plunged on a report that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is moving to revoke policies that allowed the legalization of marijuana to spread across several U.S. states.

1389 2018-01-04 17:15:21 I watched The Wolf of Wall Street this week, and can't help but see parallels to buying "cheaper" cryptos because Bitcoin is "expensive." If you're throwing $4K at penny stocks, you can afford some better shares. And you can buy a piece of a Bitcoin.
1390 2018-01-04 17:15:14 Are you sure you're just not mad you destroyed you kids future selling all your stocks before the Wall Street boom because you said Trump would destroy the market???
Self loathing is not a good look for you Kurt!!!!
1391 2018-01-04 17:15:12 Holy crap the Dow broke 25k. Dang it at this failing economy . Catch the sarcasm there? When my 401k continues to grow and my stocks continue to make money, it’s safe to say our economy is pretty solid. How can you be mad at a president who has helped make that happen?
1392 2018-01-04 17:15:07 As long as central banks can and do print money out of thin air and use it to buy stocks directly, how can it end?
1393 2018-01-04 17:15:07 With the crap stocks with crazy vacations and no substance, imo $GSUM should be $50+ on substance 50% rev growth , 80% margins, profitable this Q. Pioneer and pure play in China #BigData #AI #BLOCKCHAIN #CRM #IIOT
1394 2018-01-04 17:14:56 And why wouldn't the market be up? The corps are getting huge permanent tax cuts. Business was good before.  People's 401k are doing well but it's not a realized gain. The money's still at risk unless stocks are sold and gains taken.
1395 2018-01-04 17:14:44 The money you earn will have a higher chance of actually supporting the economy than the millions earned by executives. They mighy invest in stocks but if those stocks were previously owned by other investers it’s basically moving capital among the very rich
1396 2018-01-04 17:14:41 Exactly.  Trump, Obama, et al aside, the market is politically agnostic. Only increasing forecasted earnings  matters to stock market. Anything that increases that likelihood moves stocks up; opposite on downside.

1401 2018-01-04 17:13:26 I think its a fair point Norm is making. If your clients want you to make investments in companies with clear and predictable earnings growth and attractive valuations, your mandate is not to buy them MJ stocks with no current earnings and trade at 200x 2019 estimated earnings.
1402 2018-01-04 17:13:18 It’s crazy D f o let salmon stocks get over fished and their answer to why stocks are so low is we don’t know what happened now the government and this judge listen to them
1403 2018-01-04 17:13:12 @jeffsessions owns stocks in private prisons. Congress should do something about that egregious and very dangerous conflict of interest

1405 2018-01-04 17:12:59 Just remember that the wealthiest 10% owns 90% of all stocks. Hooray for the little guy huh?
1406 2018-01-04 17:12:58 Oof! Imagine selling stocks around 11am today... only to see them rebound in just over an hour.
$ACB for example dropped to a bargain level anywhere in those $11s. How did the market react? They bought up those cheapies instantly.
1407 2018-01-04 17:12:45 $TRX $XVG $BTC These crypto gains are insane. Got my stocks account locked & loaded & not worried. Focusing on crypto more each day.
1408 2018-01-04 17:12:01 Eurozone PMI out this morning better than expected and continues to support our “global growth” argument. Developed International stocks may be in the midst of their own #BombCyclone. Stay warm and safe today,
1409 2018-01-04 17:11:53 Just not down with the idea that stocks should lose 30% or more on the Sessions stuff, but they did.
1410 2018-01-04 17:11:52 The top 1% of America owns 50% of investment assets. (stocks, etc). The poorest half of America owns just .5% of the investments.
1411 2018-01-04 17:11:35 The stock market is NOT an indicator of a strong economy and is driven by short-term daily, even to the minute, speculation and emotion. The market was at a high in 2006 before it dropped 22% in 8 days in 2007 (The Big Short). Stocks are overvalued! Watch out!#StockMarket
1412 2018-01-04 17:11:09 First world problems- Having to do math to figure what’s making me more money, crypto currency or stocks
1413 2018-01-04 17:10:55 I get the point but most of our foreign liabilities are short term treasuries and most of our overseas assets are real assets or claims on them via stocks so hard to imagine BoP issue
1414 2018-01-04 17:10:33 MBS able to bounce off lows. Stocks give up some gains but still well into positive territory.
1415 2018-01-04 17:10:27 I think some areas are very inflated like big tech, etc BUT many areas are still relatively cheap, not even near normalized levels for the economy's level & progress (much bigger than in 2009). AND I AGREE W/ @petenajarian TO HAVE STOCKS WITH GROWTH AND VALUE!  Much in US & Intl

1419 2018-01-04 17:09:44 @AskRBC Quick question...tried to place a direct investing order for some stocks, went to a screen saying it was completed but with an error saying it couldn't confirm. Went to 'Order History' and nothing is showing. Tried a 2nd time and same thing. Thoughts?
1420 2018-01-04 17:09:13 PORTFOLIO up 0.5% today - such a strong start to a new year. Nice situation to be fully invested from much lower down and just letting my Stocks do what they will do.
1421 2018-01-04 17:09:06 Market Wrap Jan 4, 2018:
The equity market sustained strong growth today across all sectors and may remain in the positive territory in the coming trading sessions. However, there may be profit taking in some stocks.
1422 2018-01-04 17:08:45 Dow and stock market irrelevant to majority of Americans who don't own stocks. U keep touting rise in stock market but it's a trend started with PresObama, NOT due to anything u did. Also, many regulations are in place to protect environment, people. #youreamoron #fakePOTUS
1423 2018-01-04 17:08:38 Well if u dont at least work for a company that does have stocks how is that the Presidents fault? #ThanksOosamaBinObama

1426 2018-01-04 17:08:29 Whenever a rise comes it's met with equal fall since thn.  So now it's a range play in index n trend play in selective stocks
1427 2018-01-04 17:08:22 I’m trying to imagine the carnage if one of my stocks reported a miss as big as these guys did. Down 80%? Unreal that stock doesn’t budge.

1444 2018-01-04 17:05:14 #TSLA bad news is behind us.  Stocks starts its climb towards 400.
1445 2018-01-04 17:05:03 My stocks sure do like him, and I like them
1446 2018-01-04 17:04:49 Pot stocks are on sale now. I don't think the Sessions mandate will have a long term effect, it's not like the Bible Belt states were the ones where voters legalized MJ. Highly unlikely progressive states like CA, MA, OR, CO, etc are going to go against voters.
1447 2018-01-04 17:04:36 However, the “personal economic improvement” is indirectly affected by either the upturn (or downturn) in the market that enables businesses to provide “bonuses”, such as we’ve seen recently. Also, don’t forget that many couples & individuals have 401Ks/IRA’s linked to stocks.
1448 2018-01-04 17:04:18 Thank you @NYGovCuomo. As most New Yorkers well know, @NYSComptroller's "actions don't match the urgency of the climate crisis or the new financial reality of energy stocks."
1449 2018-01-04 17:04:12 Laid off ATT workers will have a much better opportunity to find another job  in a healthy economy. About 50% of the population have stocks. Either directly or through retirement or savings accounts, indirectly. Far more benefit then they realize, 100%.
1450 2018-01-04 17:03:57 Previous admin relied on QE, low interest rates, money expansion to create liquidity for stocks and tax revenues. I get it. And it was coming to an end in 2015. But now pro-growth policies are harnessing that excess liquidity and it’s rocket fuel for a rapidly expanding economy.
1451 2018-01-04 17:03:43 The more I dig into this company the more evident of how undervalued it is!

1453 2018-01-04 17:03:04 Oh man that sounds so good, hope mine stocks it
1454 2018-01-04 17:03:03 Ah oui ? Peut-être directement auprès de Oren Miller ou en contactant l'éditeur (il reste peut-être des stocks) ?... j'espère qu'il sera réédité un jour !
1455 2018-01-04 17:02:58 Strong labor market data and strength in stocks have hurt MBS this morning. The ADP estimate for private sector job gains in December was 250K, well above the consensus of 190K. Weekly Jobless Claims rose to 250K, above the consensus of 240K.
1456 2018-01-04 17:02:30 Looks like @realDonaldTrump and @jeffsessions sold off thier pot stocks just in time. The nest egg is UUGGE.
1457 2018-01-04 17:02:19 $tsla still at a discount compared to other auto stocks.
1458 2018-01-04 17:02:10 You can’t bandage your kid with stocks. You can’t use them to patch failing bridges and potholes. It doesn’t put food on the table for the middle class. When the market collapses we lose our retirement savings.
1459 2018-01-04 17:01:59 Weed stocks are volatile AF right now because of the federal shit
1460 2018-01-04 17:01:57 With the rescinding of Obama’s administration’s state pot laws by jeff sessions how do you think this will affect marijuana stocks.
1461 2018-01-04 17:01:36 I bought $400 worth of pot stocks for a penny a share.  This was 4 years ago... they stayed the same but once greed takes over the DOJ will back off.
1462 2018-01-04 17:01:30 Haha, still not a bad session for $ES_F! I have protection to downside if the #Stocks do decide to give it a rest at some point... but would rather have S&P 500 continue higher. If we do "dip", I think #Gold $GC_F, $VIX $VX_F and #Yen $JPY probably the best ways to protect/hedge.
1463 2018-01-04 17:01:22 The #TDwebbroker worked just long enough today for me to dump my @TD_Canada stocks! Plagued with technical difficulties and non-existant customer service! #frustrated #TD
1464 2018-01-04 17:01:12 #WEEDSTOCKS taking a big dip but it’s really only hurting new investors. If you were investing in the fall you should still be up especially with Canadian Cannibis stocks
1465 2018-01-04 17:01:08 Also I think $MASI is a good investment. MarketGrader gives it a score of 77 which ranks in the 99th percentile of the 5816 stocks that it ranks.
1466 2018-01-04 17:01:08 Sadly over half of the American people even own stocks.

1475 2018-01-04 17:00:37 this is a temporary glitch. It gives the money men a chance to buy in to pot stocks at a cheaper price before the bans are off and/or the nation puts it in the tobacco/alcohol status.
1476 2018-01-04 17:00:21 New Year, same old rally?  'Value' stocks like Caterpillar, Boeing, $GS lifted #Dow to 25,000 milestone, but techy #Nasdaq also rises. Advance looks more broadly based. Could be a bullish sign ^KO

1480 2018-01-04 16:59:27 Obama & the Fed pretty much separated Wall Street from the rest of the country. QE2 just put up a wall that small investors cdn't get around investing in ind stocks. Mutuals, Spyders or not much else.
1481 2018-01-04 16:59:22 Still trying to figure out which company is best for beginner trading? Miniscule amount of followers means no body to help me on this one. To the Googles I go! #investing #stocks #beginner
1482 2018-01-04 16:59:17 One of my friends pointed out that Sessions might just be using his power to drastically drop the price of weed stocks momentarily, so his cronies can buy in, before he says "all good" later today and they make millions!  Don't trust anything an insane person does or says.
1483 2018-01-04 16:58:43 Strong labor market data and strength in stocks have hurt mortgage bonds this morning. The ADP estimate for private sector job gains in December was 250K, well above the consensus of 190K. Weekly Jobless Claims rose to 250K, above the consensus of 240K.
1484 2018-01-04 16:58:42 our lack of synergy will spook the opponents. i will throw tonk bombs left and right without a care for where my teammate is. they won't know what's coming

"ok her teammate is there so that is safe and bombless--A MADWOMAN!!!!! THERE GO MY STOCKS!"
1485 2018-01-04 16:58:39 I invest on behalf of my clients. I do not gamble. You obviously don't know the difference and I feel sorry for you. Marijuana stocks are not suitable for most investors, just like dot-com stocks were not suitable either. Short memories can be very dangerous.
1486 2018-01-04 16:58:39 AirPods en rupture de stocks partout. Il se moque de moi sérieusement ?!

1488 2018-01-04 16:58:05 Crypto currency and stocks are two COMPLETELY different things. Stocks are an investment, bitcoin is a toy.
1489 2018-01-04 16:57:53 Love you mr president my stocks are high ever been you are the man media need to tell the truth
1490 2018-01-04 16:57:47 Using the words "Dow" and "Crash" in the same sentence is probably not advisable. #MAGA #WednesdayWisdom #stocks
1491 2018-01-04 16:57:45 How backward is that?  Bring back the stocks.
1492 2018-01-04 16:57:44 Yeah that sucks. Stocks took a big hit this morning after huge gains yesterday. Hope Sessions gets taken out in the fray when they impeach Trump.
1493 2018-01-04 16:57:35 #ThursdayThoughts I guess Jeff Sessions said the hell with it since everyone else in the #RepublicanParty is getting rich through that A$$hole #Trump and his Ignorance, after the Obama-era, I might as well get in on it too and stuff my pockets through my stocks in Private Jails.
1494 2018-01-04 16:57:10 Jeff wants his private prisons full and pharma stocks gaining. As usual, follow the money.
1495 2018-01-04 16:57:09 Marijuana stocks off the highs
1496 2018-01-04 16:56:53 MBS able to bounce off lows. Stocks give up some gains but still well into positive territory.
1497 2018-01-04 16:56:39 Yes my stocks high ever been scented you guys took office wonderful job I resoand love you both
1498 2018-01-04 16:56:35 I'm working middle class. I own stocks, mutual funds and commodities - which is more than I can say for most of my friends. The Dow Jones average means very little to me individually. It's a mixed bag as far as performance goes.
1499 2018-01-04 16:56:28 Was wondering why my stocks were crashing!!! Uggggg
1500 2018-01-04 16:56:26 Stocks open higher.
1501 2018-01-04 16:56:24 Reports are saying up to 30% in performance to fix a security exploit. I'm not happy about it as it affects all Intel-based pc, laptops, and servers including our surface pros. The CEO of Intel knew about the issue but sold nearly all of his stocks before the news broke.
1502 2018-01-04 16:56:20 $n $nxttf got a big bounce
1503 2018-01-04 16:56:13 PLEASE Sarah, Stocks are in a FED bubble, Please prepare for a down market.  SOON
1504 2018-01-04 16:55:44 Financial outlet talking heads mentioning how Dow Jones catalysts have been companies like Boeing, Cat and 3M...you know, real companies. Aaand on the Canadian side, MARIJUANA stocks are holding the TSX back today. Yup, we're in trouble!
1505 2018-01-04 16:55:40 It's not the regulations, it's the tax cuts. Stocks get more and more valuable as the richest pay less and less. Fat cats play golf and watch the market on TV all day. "My God, how the money rolls in!" Throw a one-off bonus as a tip to the workers, hoard all the rest.
1506 2018-01-04 16:55:36 how many shares you gonna buy 
1507 2018-01-04 16:55:35 Russian Troll says what?

Like you have stocks to worry about. I hope Putin takes away your vodka rations 
1508 2018-01-04 16:55:26 Which cuts in which regulations?

A lot of over exuberant investors are gonna have a sad when their stocks get bought back to make the Carl Icahns of the world even richer.
1509 2018-01-04 16:55:09 I would not run away from Canadian energy stocks but any new names I have bought and will buy in the foreseeable future will not be Canadian until the political environment moves away from being anti-energy.
1510 2018-01-04 16:55:07 #ThanksObama stocks rising is a result of the continuing resolution of the 2017 Federal Budget .. Congress hasn't passed a Federal Budget for cheeto to sign so the country is still running under the one signed by Obama
1511 2018-01-04 16:55:03 Meanwhile im sure stocks for handcuff and prison mattress manufacturers just went through the roof. This entire administration is willfully ignorant of science
1512 2018-01-04 16:54:58 Non, ça c'est sûr, il ne sera pas réédité.
Mais parfois on trouve des magasins qui ont des stocks invendus.
30€ ça fait mal quand même pour un amiibo.
1513 2018-01-04 16:54:52 @VP single mom 2 kids I've heard of stocks never HAD any want to share some and I thought in Christianity we weren't supposed to worship money
1514 2018-01-04 16:53:36 Nice one buddy was sitting in the doc office watching these stocks move.  Aj is mind blowing.
1515 2018-01-04 16:53:29 Yes but the drop is not technical, it is because of AG Sessions trashing Obama’s era regulations. Most if not pot stocks are way down.
1516 2018-01-04 16:53:17 $ROKU 1/2 the float was already short & other 1/2 is mostly held by insiders that can’t sell  since the only thing that makes #stocks move are buyers vs sellers buy it will be hard for them to sink it

1518 2018-01-04 16:52:50 I agree over simplification is inevitable on Twitter. And the large grain harvest in Punjab shows that more could have been done without risking any ships. The merchants held onto their stocks. Better administration could have stopped that.
1519 2018-01-04 16:52:27 Its a easy as investing in 401K or stocks..people make it sound like you have to be rich, or that it's complicated..it's not.
1520 2018-01-04 16:52:27 This guy is gonna drive the Dow through 30k. If you don’t have stocks and/or 401k, shame on you
1521 2018-01-04 16:52:16 Looking through charts you see the first 15 minutes brutalized weed stocks and most have been floundering around that area ever since.
1522 2018-01-04 16:51:57 Love the show but every year we hear Dan pontificate on the ludicrousness of draft value.  It's not complicated: players are stock and stocks are influenced by many different variables including perceived value. It's that simple.

1525 2018-01-04 16:50:20 But Marth is easier to play around than MK. You make one mistake against MK and that's your stock. It's not the same against Marth. The only way Marth takes early stocks is with a shieldbreak (hard to get) whereas all MK needs is a dash attack
1526 2018-01-04 16:49:59 Took a hit from the Jeff Session news - for tiny stocks i would exit around the triple of my avg price (8c x 3 -> 24 ct) - my dumb process, shit happens but i stick to it - over baskets of 10-20 stocks it works - never put a lot of capital into each stock, play small
1527 2018-01-04 16:49:54 Fuck you @realDonaldTrump and your dumbass staff. @jeffsessions fucking up my stocks and shit fuck all your government fuck you
1528 2018-01-04 16:49:35 @Td_canada what’s going on?! Second time in a week I can’t sign on to sell stocks!! Unacceptable!!!

1532 2018-01-04 16:48:57 Dear Kurt. The presidency is predictable, but I sold my stocks a long time ago and have put my $$$ in more tangible and predictable products. You're kids are better off now. Lol!

1540 2018-01-04 16:47:54 You know what is 'Goals!" for me?
Buy stocks knowing plans you have for them, and then announce the purchases & the plans, and the market reacts by pushing the stock price up for you. Warren Buffet frequently buys stocks, then announces that he's bought them, and then they go up.
1541 2018-01-04 16:47:49 How the Fxxk can #Gold mining stocks continually go DOWN while gold spot rises? HAD enough of this Fxxxxxxd up manipulative market, cashing out putting into #Cryptocurrency #BTG #EGO

1543 2018-01-04 16:47:25 seems like while lots of fear is being put into bitcoin investing & maybe with some justification many who got into the trade early on made a small fortune & as of now several bitcoin stocks are in play
1544 2018-01-04 16:47:23 Hello sir. I didnt understand the second part. 3% growth rate, 10% discounting and 0.07.  request you to throw some light on these or can you guide me some books/articles which will explain the same ? I am looking to apply this valuation method(potential m cap) to other stocks.
1545 2018-01-04 16:47:11 If you guys are hyping bonds, doesn't that mean you are looking at stocks going down

1551 2018-01-04 16:45:28 Out of these stocks what do u suggest to go long with conviction ?
1552 2018-01-04 16:44:52 First investing advice of 2018: look into marijuana stocks, specifically Candian ones.
1553 2018-01-04 16:44:33 Jim, I just got back from Mexico. Any thoughts on Mexican airport stocks such as PAC.
Thanks
1554 2018-01-04 16:44:23 And the pot stocks plunge! It was a suckers bet, considering it's ILLEGAL and all these companies are commiting felonies.
1555 2018-01-04 16:44:23 *Or have stocks in private prisons, which skyrocketed when Trump took office.
1556 2018-01-04 16:44:09 5. Ban high-capacity magazines, modifications to guns (bump stocks), and "build-it-yourself" kits. Every gun has a serial number that can be tracked.
1557 2018-01-04 16:44:07 i think its ridiculous with all the fees all these banks collect and the fact were in 2018 they cant come up with a platform that can handle a larger volume day. I am proudly Canadian and the BS going on in the US is precisely the reason I own 0 dollars in US stocks, only CDN!
1558 2018-01-04 16:43:44 ADRs maybe but penny stocks 
1559 2018-01-04 16:43:44 You do know that the overwhelming majority of Americans have nothing to gain by stock market increases. They don’t own stocks or bonds. 

When jobless numbers come in, or increases in median wages, or declines in the cost of living, inflation... then get back to us.

1562 2018-01-04 16:43:04 Well we should ignore this just like we have ignored bump stocks. Perhaps we should legalize rocket propelled grenades in case someone sees a need to use those for deer hunting or to protect their home.
1563 2018-01-04 16:43:02 $NQ_F $QQQ You want yo be long stocks when a new cycle is starting - cycles that start with high levels of energy are the most predictable.

1569 2018-01-04 16:41:21 Well stocks are bullish. Macroeconomic data should see stocks rise. But oil and commodities are a different story. Good Macro data doesn't mean the data on those rise. I'll defend the rise in stocks, but NOT the rise in oil.

1590 2018-01-04 16:36:57 Yes, I am biased.  I also know the challenges we went through, just to build an ETF that only invested in federally compliant #cannabis stocks, so I would have concerns with putting assets into one that isn’t and takes a blind (index) approach.

1611 2018-01-04 16:32:37 You don't have to own stocks. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. That benefits all Americans. Home ownership is at a 20 year high. 80% of Americans will get a tax cut. Even some of the liberal news media have started admitting that.  So now what? How has he not done anythign good?
1612 2018-01-04 16:32:14 Good idea. I may be running low on fuel by then what with having to power Putin’s mind control ray. I’ll need fresh liberal tears to replenish stocks.
1613 2018-01-04 16:32:12 For all the talk of how dumb dubya and reagan were , at least they weren't telling people to buy stocks in 1987/ 2007. Trump has now cornered himself into taking full blame, for a crash.
1614 2018-01-04 16:32:10 Stocks are overvalued relative to P/E (think Amazon), Earnings and tax cut money are not the same things! 401k's lost 22% in 2008 under similar conditions. Watch out!#StockMarket
1615 2018-01-04 16:32:06 Has been since Bernanke led Fed decided the way out of the 2007 financial crisis was the wealth effect.  Why he expected that to work when the poor who don't own stocks couldn't pay their debts is a mystery. He did create massive inequality.

1624 2018-01-04 16:29:44 *deep, calming breath* Poor people don't own stocks. Poor people don't benefit from a booming stock market. You know who benefits from a booming stock market? People that are already rich. Why don't we stop making the rich richer, and try to help EVERYONE in this country?
1625 2018-01-04 16:29:43 Can you say 'bubble.'  Companies are buying their own stocks with tax breaks and trillions in profits and ~80% of returns being pocketed by top 10%, and 40% by top 1%.  Guess who will pay the bill?  Seriously.  Guess...

1633 2018-01-04 16:27:26 Marijuana is a huge blind spot for the conservative movement. Their stance of either accepting or endorsing prohibition keeps them as laughing stocks in the cultural current.
1634 2018-01-04 16:27:25 Stocks which are highly correlated with Nifty could be susceptible. Suspect an ending diagonal being formed there. Better strategy is to be stock specific and concentrate on stocks which are coming out of long correction. Not a bad strategy to be cash heavy at the moment

1669 2018-01-04 16:23:45 To the poor folks who think this is a meaningful number for them: it is not. This is about the value of stocks (do you own any?) and involves some degree of speculation so its not even tightly tied to the real world performance of the companies listed, including jobs etc.
1670 2018-01-04 16:23:44 It is absolutely right sir. Many stocks have been running upward by operators. Unknowingly some investors will be losing their money later or sooner.

1717 2018-01-04 16:13:40 Kinda happy I wasn’t able to buy more weed stocks yesterday since that Neanderthal Jeff Sessions trying to kill weed momentum
1718 2018-01-04 16:13:40 The stock market is NOT an indicator of a strong economy and is driven by short-term daily, even to the minute, speculation and emotion. The market was at a high in 2006 before it dropped 22% in 8 days in 2007 (The Big Short). Stocks are overvalued! Watch out!#StockMarket
1719 2018-01-04 16:13:23 Ethanol Stocks by padd: PADD I +99, PADD II +616, PADD III -66, PADD IV (no one cares but) +3  PADD V -64
1720 2018-01-04 16:13:00 I agree, and trump is a money man. And stocks in pot based companies has risen drastically since California legalized it recreationally.

1723 2018-01-04 16:12:29 How about private prison stocks?...since you think this is funny
1724 2018-01-04 16:12:04 You gotta have a great commish rate and decent capital to even try on #ES_F   I could not do it.  I watch it and use it for moves but all options/stocks now
1725 2018-01-04 16:11:54 you MUST KNOW two facts: first=most of the folks who sent you to the WH do not own any stocks and while stock prices are up over 2500% since 60's their wages are WORTH LESS today & 2nd=the GOP can NOT keep the stock BUBBLE (aka #PonziScheme) going forever: so what's the END GAME?
1726 2018-01-04 16:11:43 Because as we all know- stocks are indicative of long-term economic success. Not largely based upon needless speculation and hype.
1727 2018-01-04 16:11:23 80% of stocks are owned by 5% of the population. So big stock market numbers mean nothing to the average struggling working class American.
1728 2018-01-04 16:11:11 The issue with Intel security vulnerability brings to mind a quote from Carl Sagan when great technological powers are in the hands of a few..., intel knew about it before it got publicised and sell of stocks lol
1729 2018-01-04 16:11:09 Timing the market top is virtually impossible and the most sophisticated institutions don’t do it on a repeatable, systematic basis.  Investors are more incentivized to not only stay fully invested but to consider asset classes which are uncorrelated to stocks and bonds. $QAI
1730 2018-01-04 16:10:53 Cannabis stocks were soaring until Jeff Sessions made an announcement about rescinding some of Obama’s administration memo regarding Federal cannabis law enforcement. Leave the states alone Sessions.
1731 2018-01-04 16:10:47 @kurteichenwald letting you know the DOW hit 25,000. Hopefully people you urged to sell stock preparing for a Trump presidency last November didn’t listen! You sold your children’s education stocks and sold them out. Worst writer ever! As for me, I held on to mine! Great day!

1749 2018-01-04 16:08:37 I agree with you. But when huge dips happen, it shakes investor confidence. Not looking good for MJ stocks in the coming weeks. IMO
1750 2018-01-04 16:08:25 The stock market went nuts waiting for that HUGE TAX CUT.  That doesn't translate to workers that can't afford to buy stocks so big deal.
1751 2018-01-04 16:08:22 I don't own stocks, per se.  However, my retirement plan is dependent on the investing team having a robust market to go to for good returns.
1752 2018-01-04 16:08:14 How much of the working class actually owns stocks?
1753 2018-01-04 16:08:09 #weed stocks sure selling off. It’s all good when your mostly cash. Let’s see what kinda deals we find today #happyhunting
1754 2018-01-04 16:07:58 Lol yes . Don't want to see anyone lose money. But people really has to stop chasing some of these stocks that are highly overvalued. Last post going in boat . Good luck. $idk looking good for in at the low of the day
1755 2018-01-04 16:07:37 I’m really upset the weed stocks are plunging, but I’m also about to buy into the dip once they hit a really low number.
1756 2018-01-04 16:07:12 Very nice. Wish I knew some good stocks to pick up on this dip
1757 2018-01-04 16:07:10 Or just don't sell the stocks you had in Apple before the return of Jobs. D'oh! :-(
1758 2018-01-04 16:07:09 So now you're going to take one issue which is Trump's New Yorker mentality and do the same.  Hopefully again enough votes come in to counter whatever the Dems put forward,  if not then don't complain when your taxes go up and the stocks tank,  and we have single payer.
1759 2018-01-04 16:07:07 Are there any penny stocks?  That's all I can afford.

1775 2018-01-04 16:04:33 Just so we're actually clear, you can (& should) ask your rep "What stocks should I buy?" and other direct questions. They should have answers for you...and you should be able to select a time period & ask about the best picks for growth over that time period. You pay for this!

1822 2018-01-04 15:58:23 Kevin is a lobbyist for the prison industrial complex. The more states that legalize weed means less people going to prison. Which is bad for prison stocks because those white people make a living off minority’s going to prison.

1832 2018-01-04 15:56:28 Why shouldn’t the stock market be soaring? You and @realDonaldTrump just gave corporations over $1 TRILLION of taxpayers hard-earned money!

1842 2018-01-04 15:54:42 Wait till the market picks up it. We should see a run on semiconductor stocks
1843 2018-01-04 15:54:35 Your funny! But how does stock market help everyday people who make 9 dollars an hour? Do they have stocks or 401k savings? Can they ever retire? How many companies share that wealth? None! Stockholders first!
1844 2018-01-04 15:54:14 I am not a financial advisor but I believe the following stocks will run this year $TEVA $AMD .. $MU and $AMAT will continue their trend along with $VMW.  And banking stocks $BAC $WFC $JPM
1845 2018-01-04 15:54:13 So far he had increased stock but not economy. Stocks are not economy
1846 2018-01-04 15:54:01 Exactly.  The same left that advised everyone to sell their stocks when Trump took office.

1847 2018-01-04 15:54:01 sure would be nice to buy some cheap #stocks RIGHT NOW @TD_Canada
1848 2018-01-04 15:53:55 Didn't change a thing. Kept all my stocks the way they were but i did purchase some more bitcoins. I now own about 3,700. Those are my real pay day. Other stocks are only around $8 mil, so not a lot.
1849 2018-01-04 15:53:55 @justindangelo you are so wrong ask any stocks pro and they will tell you its trump not obama. Really know your shit nefore you tweet... Cause when when you make STUPID comments like that it just shows how dumb you are. Research = smart!!
1850 2018-01-04 15:53:38 This has nothing to do with you! BTW, who are you congratulating? Most middle class Americans don't own stocks so it continues to only affect you and your rich cronies!
1851 2018-01-04 15:53:29 @RBC 

RBC Direct sucks. U should B social media shamed.

1854 2018-01-04 15:53:18 It only benefits those who own stocks and those who have 401ks, which is only 40% of working Americans.
1855 2018-01-04 15:53:18 Half our population doesn't even own stocks, bonds, etc. This helps Americans alright...the Americans who don't really need help. 

Also: Markets go down, too. Will you own that when it happens?
1856 2018-01-04 15:53:16 My boyfriend just started trading and is having amazing luck just picking stocks off my scanners. It's REAL annoying

1869 2018-01-04 15:51:46 Reminder: 61% of all stocks are owned by the wealthiest 1% of Americans.
1870 2018-01-04 15:51:36 Time 2 buy, kids! Drove price of stocks down & when AG "leaves" price will go up again!
1871 2018-01-04 15:51:31 39% of Americans don't have a saving account. 43% of stocks are owned by foreigners.
1872 2018-01-04 15:51:07 This is only the beginning, the stocks will continue to rise throughout the next 7 years of your presidency!

1878 2018-01-04 15:49:28 Were exactly are those jobs, do you have stocks (most American don’t), where do you work, when did you get your last raise, do you have children and would you want them to act like this idiot?????????? Do you consider people who read elites? Do you read to your children, why?
1879 2018-01-04 15:49:24 What's up with your boy Sessions? I am in my 40s and a long conservative and even I think pot should be legal. I thought you guys were pro less regs. Please federally tax the pot trade. You guys made a bunch of stocks tank today. I had to sell off some.@realDonaldTrump
1880 2018-01-04 15:49:23 4 in 10 Americans own stocks. The rich get richer. Not exactly speaking to the base here Jr 
1881 2018-01-04 15:49:15 According to this BMO guy if you always look forward you see 3% GDP growth, but when the data comes in at 2% that doesn’t matter because it’s backward looking, stocks went up anyways and you’re a macro loser
1882 2018-01-04 15:48:50 aren't theses stocks going to tank BIG TIME with jeff seessions move??

1898 2018-01-04 15:46:50 It's price to earnings. Everyone knows that. You started off decent and then slipped into using ad hominems. Can’t say I’m surprised though. We’re talking facts, you’re gibbering off some nonsense about stocks being related to budgets lol
1899 2018-01-04 15:46:19 Does Jeff Sessions really have stocks w Private Prison Companies?
1900 2018-01-04 15:46:12 I’d wager a good chunk of people trading these stocks don’t even know what that means Bird.
1901 2018-01-04 15:45:42 Y’all know this isn’t a real indicator of anything other than those stocks are doing well. Why is this still a thing???
1902 2018-01-04 15:45:35 There’s two types of investors IMO. The first is an investor to help solve real world problems and bet on a thriving company (like what we all want in stocks.) The second is an investor in $FUD tokens. 1 of them make sense & 1 need support to fuel their FOMO. Which one are you?
1903 2018-01-04 15:45:34 ..sold all my marijuana stocks this morning that had profit..except my MJX etf..all because of Jeff Sessions && his war on drugs agenda..the market been green since opening this week & this morning it went straight downhill..smh..Canadian stocks it is..

1910 2018-01-04 15:44:40 Traditionally with 'stocks' like this when you can guarantee movements in volume of 2.5-7.5% on the hour constantly there will be groups making their living on flipping 10-50k.   200-1000 hourly or 750-6250 PER HOUR!

1925 2018-01-04 15:43:36 My friend this simply comes down to what they own stocks and interests in. Keep marijuana illegal, incarcerate millions of minorities, keep funding private prisons, buy stocks in that area. They have never been against making money... only stopping things that can affect theirs.
1926 2018-01-04 15:43:32 Also most of these mmj plays or only trading 1m pluss daily. Will be interesting on some stocks if they go short and cover with thier warrents . Time well tell. Either way some if these stocks are going higher
1927 2018-01-04 15:43:09 right now we are invested in #cannabis stocks that are complying with federal rules, so impact will be minimal for us.

1932 2018-01-04 15:42:18 yuh, stocks are going up because corporate boards are issuing dividends to their shareholders because of the tax cuts, those dividends are used to invest in foreign assets
1933 2018-01-04 15:42:08 Absolutely possibly on some stocks . But not all . Retail will gladly sell for 500% 600% win . That is a huge win
1934 2018-01-04 15:41:58 Here in Germany gold is really popular. Germans hate stocks, they have savings accounts, life insurance and gold.

1957 2018-01-04 15:38:21 yea.. no it doesn't work that way. stocks higher does not equal to higher earnings ("corps make money") - ideally it'd be the other way around and a more stable process than the current bull trend.
1958 2018-01-04 15:38:19 Umm - no, that’s not how it works. The stock market rise is nice, & I own stocks, but I can’t expand my business due to a stock market rise.

1986 2018-01-04 15:34:00 Like all of these sorts of analyses, the numbers are skewed by the large portion of the overall wealth in those upper percentiles. Any similar stats for portion of household income in stocks at each income level? Just wonder if it's less skewed or pretty much the same.
1987 2018-01-04 15:33:55 And how does that affect me given I do not own any stocks?? 
1988 2018-01-04 15:33:40 Pension funds innvest in stocks and leave their positions for decades, taking only the dividends. They know that there is usually nothing to be gained from buying and selling over the short term.
1989 2018-01-04 15:33:38 Not an exhaustive list by any means, just random stocks that I happen to see people tweeting about. Viewing them relative to one another helps me sort wheat from chaff
1990 2018-01-04 15:33:25 It’s sad because if we get nuked by No Korea because of small buttons pissing contest your job and stocks won’t help you.  If you are trump’s friend, if he has any, try telling him to act like an adult!
1991 2018-01-04 15:32:44 Or at least it's working for the people who own stocks instead of living paycheck-to-paycheck - you know, like college-educated, white voters like me who voted for Hillary Clinton.

2015 2018-01-04 15:28:35 Following the useless surprise list of Byron Wein, Art Cashin just offered that if Jan & Feb are up, there is a chance stocks can gain 10%+ this year.

2020 2018-01-04 15:28:06 Jesse Livermore's rules to trading

Cut your losses quick; let your profits ride; the action is with the leading stocks; new highs are to be bought on breakouts; cheap stocks are often not bargains, because they have little potential to rise in price.

2025 2018-01-04 15:27:56 stocks so boring compared to crypto
2026 2018-01-04 15:27:55 There's nothing in the $VIX calculation that says it's directional.  It's only highly correlated, but it can break and go the other way when stocks melt up.  I think that was the only point of whatever article you were referencing which I didn't see a link for.  Just guessing
2027 2018-01-04 15:27:53 we know about panic sells, so the bounces will be there!  personally im hoping they do the same as canuck stocks did when Govt hit them cause I want to load the boat, gotta determine the real companies from the trash (outlined that in a couple tweets), thanks for the good wishes!

2033 2018-01-04 15:27:01 I wish I knew more about stocks and trading.
2034 2018-01-04 15:27:00 We haven't reached the levels seen in 1998 - 2000 yet.  Stocks are up, but not euphoric.  The theory that you asked to be explained was that if this ramp up continues for several more years, then it's very likely the VIX will rise with it.  There is precedent for that.
2035 2018-01-04 15:26:50 Cox is the world's best commercial apple by a very long stalk.  And 2017/18 must be its finest season  in living memory.  Take advantage while stocks last - before it's back to boring old Braeburns! #topcox!

2040 2018-01-04 15:25:57 You shouldn’t be in an aggressive plan close to retirement. You should have a conservative plan as you approach retirement. The ones that lost big were flying too close to the sun. There is always a risk with stocks.The only way around it is to take from someone else

His coworker made 90k from crypto so now he's ready to invest. We can't compete with these outrageous gains lol
2068 2018-01-04 15:20:31 don't want 2 sound 2 bullish here but the new all time highs & the buy the dip mentality coupled with the lack of stock supply makes 4 a very bullish longterm scenario When stocks correct everyone has the mentality of "It'll come back" They r certainly not reallocating their IRAs
2069 2018-01-04 15:20:27 Are you so stupid that you dont know you can buy stocks yourself? For a fee of just $6.95 to a place like Merril Lynch you can buy your own stocks
2070 2018-01-04 15:20:07 At last a dip in marijuana stocks here in Canada, maybe a further dip so I can buy some. Nice name, Blockchain Melissa LLC. LOL!  Twitter was able to verify that with you.

2072 2018-01-04 15:19:34 It is tho. The Dow is made up of well performed stocks high priced stocks. If a stock consistently under-performs it is replaced with well performing stock high priced stock. It gives a false sense of economic security. But I’m sure you Trumpets know all about the economy.

2078 2018-01-04 15:18:28 Everyone has been getting excited about Marijuana stocks, but Trump is extremely anti-drug and he will eventually declare a new "war on drugs" like Regan did in the 80's.  AG Sessions is starting the ball rolling.

2083 2018-01-04 15:17:08 I feel like based off research I've done, there's about six things you must know about when it comes to trading.

2100 2018-01-04 15:14:29 And established money is going to say the collapse of housing / stocks market is going to "come out of nowhere" (again). But crypto-currency collapse is going to be a giant "told you so". #fuckedup #markets

2113 2018-01-04 15:12:24 If you have a 401k you are invested in the stock market and your 401k has stocks in it.  The poor not investing in the stock market or investing at all for that matter is one of the main reasons why they are poor.
2114 2018-01-04 15:12:16 Or you can try the app “stash” . It helps you invest your money into stocks . You deposit the money and the pros do the rest . Money accumulates fast . My accountant at my job uses it

2117 2018-01-04 15:11:20 You know cannabis stocks are booming when the CSE loads slow, Tsx loads slow, stock house loads slow etc. Every place I go for information on weed stocks is slow in loading. Crazy amount of investors looking at the Canadian market.
2118 2018-01-04 15:10:51 Hey, now.  They had to sell those GM stocks to...

...wait a minute, it will come to me...

Huh.  When you say it out loud like that...

2127 2018-01-04 15:09:16 Wonderful news for those who have stocks! However I would bet many of Trump voters & those in the lower & middle class don't own stock.This  wouldn't effect their lives unless companies put the money made into their employees, not  into more for investors.
2128 2018-01-04 15:09:14 If you invested in Facebook back in August 2012 at $18 and sold 5.5 years later at its peak trading at $186 you would of made 10X. People are making 10X in 1-3 months in crypto.  Keep buying those stocks grandpa. $trx $cnd $eng $alts $btc

2131 2018-01-04 15:09:00 another import, England doesn't rule Britannia anymore but can fill its cricket team with forgein ears. It's stifled South African stocks for years, money the invest in youth.  KOLPAK players thru County teams is even worse, the ICC should act and ml out a stop to this
2132 2018-01-04 15:08:50 This is one more disadvantage in India. For shorting we have to take short position  in future only unlike US and EU where they u can short Stocks in cash and can hold over night
2133 2018-01-04 15:08:38 Most Americans don't have money to invest in the top 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones. This isn't working for Main Street in KY, MS, MO, WV, TN, LA, PA, WI, SC and lest we forget, IN. It is working for Dems with investments, like me.

2142 2018-01-04 15:07:44 The GOP has their hands in the til too. They turn away bc they own millions in stocks and other businesses that they will profit from.

2146 2018-01-04 15:07:09 No. Most Americans who support Trump don’t own stocks and see their money going to you and your wealthy donors

2152 2018-01-04 15:06:42 Just need someone with money & a good idea about darts, Had 3 SHOP’s opened near me , thinking. They can do same , ALL GONE, if someone went for it, we can provide stocks easy

2154 2018-01-04 15:06:34 Weed stocks still took a tumble this morning based on that news. Canopy down 7.6% , ACB down 6.7% and APH down 9.83% as of 11:06am

2165 2018-01-04 15:04:42 The upcoming recession is primarily the Kochs/ Putin pushing oil and coal prices. They make short term $ to be used against us, then sell stocks to crash market attacking US.
2166 2018-01-04 15:04:24 The hopium of the #TaxReform is the kind of driver that pushes stocks into la la land.

2169 2018-01-04 15:04:06 As "unintentional" as the 3 Equifax executives that sold stocks?
2170 2018-01-04 15:03:53 On the Economy? Yeah you're right.  Drugs Are still illegal,unaffordable Healthcare is now affordable, And the economy which was in the tank now has unemployment at a 17 year low, Stocks at an all time high, ISIS getting taken out,Lower taxes, More money. All that was undone.
2171 2018-01-04 15:03:49 Yeah, I'm guessing VP's portfolio contains some stocks of some of the companies he helped get the biggest tax cuts to
2172 2018-01-04 15:03:42 stocks or crypto?
2173 2018-01-04 15:03:20 Do you own any stocks in any companies?  Have you invested in anything?  Do you know how the Stock Market actually works?  Or is your blind hatred for all things Trump clouding your already feeble mind?
2174 2018-01-04 15:03:11 The sky seems to be the limit: Dow überspringt erstmals Marke von 25.000 Punkten! #stocks, #WallStreet

2176 2018-01-04 15:02:54 My stocks are doing well & I owe it to President Trump.
2177 2018-01-04 15:02:49 Stocks are not an indicator of anything other than the burst of the bubble and a correction that is well over due. How is Felix Sater doing these days junior ?
2178 2018-01-04 15:02:29 You don’t have to be sure my point is to the average person this is meaningless and I’m are people with 401ks and stocks would rather a solid steady market occur than an inflated one
2179 2018-01-04 15:02:10 Boy. It's only been 2 days plus a half hour and already #tdwebbroker is sucking badly. Somebody over there better fix this immediately! All my stocks are going nuts and there's nothing I can do about it!!!!!!

2183 2018-01-04 15:01:27 The idea of trading these pot stocks is to be 100% liquid on these pull backs. They have -30% while your portfolio stays flat as you wait to buy back in cheaper.
2184 2018-01-04 15:01:04 DJIA just passed 25,000!

2191 2018-01-04 15:00:05 But you are correct in expecting my view to prove itself correct or incorrect shortly. I expect a big move in the POG during Q1 2018 with new all time highs in 2019. If you are from the US, I think LT there will be a big buying opportunity for stocks, i.e. ~ 10 times SPX in gold.
2192 2018-01-04 14:59:59 Yeah true san paji,bt I hate gaps bcoz they limit me to be jst one dimentional trader,I cant short stocks positionally..

2200 2018-01-04 14:59:00 10% own 84% of the stocks and the other 16% get killed by fees. That might have something to do with it
2201 2018-01-04 14:58:57 This little lipless bamanelf sent my pot stocks south. That's okay though, time to buy on the low since his boss's days are numbered, and likely, so are his. I'm sure his opiate producer portfolio bounced on his announcement.

2207 2018-01-04 14:58:03 Probably won't get much out of dip buying weed stocks today with the bad news.
2208 2018-01-04 14:57:51 If your salary was $50K in 2017 and the business went down in 2018 that $50K doesn't go away. If you had $50K in stock in 2017 and the business went down in 2018 the stock would be worth virtually nothing. Salary and stocks are different animals.
2209 2018-01-04 14:57:15 The only bad thing to come from Jeff seassions news is the influence it will have on marijuana stocks today and tomorrow. My positions are already down lol

2215 2018-01-04 14:56:11 How is it manipulated? Look at bitcoin. There is hundreds of billions of dollars that didn't exist before which is free to buy stocks. This is going up 45% at least this year.

2217 2018-01-04 14:56:08 These rich boys are buying all the stocks. Whats gonna happen when they sell off and cash in. To bad that none of these riches affect the middle classes pockets.
2218 2018-01-04 14:56:01 With all the money in weed stocks now, it's going to get political. D.C. wants palms greased as always and they will get it.

2221 2018-01-04 14:55:24 lmao no way -- these dips are opportunities at this time of year. MJ sector always pulls in beginning of Jan. Many of the stocks dipping are completely unaffected by any policy changes that might happen. It's just a retail panic IMHO.

2223 2018-01-04 14:55:01 Cdn pot stock have been amazing as they tie down Provincial supply contracts for recreational pot legalization on July 1st. I find it shocking that medical marijuana is not legal everywhere in the U. S.  Some stocks Up over 600%.  I can't believe Sessions is doing this.
2224 2018-01-04 14:54:51 Here is how market works. Same group owns 80 %of all the stocks.

Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.

2459 2018-01-04 13:52:22 Great question.  We can't (in theory.)  How are we earning more on our assets?  Stocks moving up & to the right on low volatility.  In other words, as long as stocks (that many call an everything bubble) rise forever on low volatility, US BoP imbalances likely can't go acute.
2460 2018-01-04 13:51:59 Maybe Hempton and Cohodes should just pimp their dirtbag stocks, commune with the peanut gallery, and accept that behaving like garbage attracts garbage men. I enjoy tweeting about frauds and hypocrites. Which they are. The don't like it, they can lump it.
2461 2018-01-04 13:51:59 If you feel anxious when in a trade and exit because you get scared: Look to trade large cap stocks. Everything changed for me when I did that. These stocks moves slower, so you have time to think and react to the chart. And you get points in profits!

2489 2018-01-04 13:43:21 It is going to ppl who bought stocks. Some stocks cost pennies. Its going to people who take control of their money. Obviously welfare bums still get their money from tax payers. They also waste it on scratch tickets and smokes. Let’s not lie anymore. I’ve seen it for decades.
2490 2018-01-04 13:42:57 " Most of the time stocks are subject to irrational and excessive price fluctuations in both directions as the consequence of the ingrained tendency of most people to speculate or gamble … to give way to hope, fear and greed."

2502 2018-01-04 13:37:43 Be pragmatic. Some stocks could fall 5 points and still look fine on a bigger picture. Example, $GOOGL. But if you buy it here & it falls 5 points, what do you do? Moral, "Buy right, sit tight."

2519 2018-01-04 13:30:15 Hahaha I can understand your predictment.. But logic goes out of the window when you're trading

I mean good strong profitable stocks take years to double whereas loss making penny stocks double in a week 

As an engineer that must drive you crazy :))

2521 2018-01-04 13:27:26 Some couraging AH action in $NTNX. It is always a plus when a stock gaps up as this leaves many weak hands behind. Best case scenario is a runaway gap-up where even the intraday dip buyers get no chance to enter. Let's see if that's the case today. #stocks
2522 2018-01-04 13:27:09 The current Crypto Market reminds me of Penny Stocks back in the early 2000s. Investors would pump up a penny stock on the forums and leave fools holding the bag. #cryptocurrency #Crypto

2530 2018-01-04 13:25:20 It's actually quite smart. I see a lot of stocks breaking all-time highs and it's difficult to know when the air comes out. At least it gives some resistance markers on the way down.

2539 2018-01-04 13:21:00 Not at all because (a) the BTC fall did happen - we are not last month anymore where everything was only going up (b) all pumped up stocks have the same pattern of going only up until ... things break down $DPW $KCPC etc... over the medium term good luck to you i just wait 
2540 2018-01-04 13:19:22 Sure Jacob. The day he became President he hit the magic button on his desk and all was well.  Statistics from prior years showing clear, steady upward movement for economy, stocks, and lowered unemployment "fake," right?

2550 2018-01-04 13:12:04 Of course some stocks rise and some fall; market indices provide an overview. So you think that BP is in the FTSE250 
2551 2018-01-04 13:12:02 OMG. The lesson is to invest as often as possible. Every year , every Q, every month. No educated Investor is going to buy stocks one time and then give up after 1,2,3,5 years. Keep learning, Keep investing, repeat. It’s that simple.
2552 2018-01-04 13:11:44 It seems wise to play creditor or shareholder in stocks but not both unless it’s a great buy. Also, if you can get in pre-IPO, that’s clearly the right way to go.
2553 2018-01-04 13:10:53 Yes. I know how stocks work. Do you know how production works? G-Fuel makes product at $x per unit. They then sell that unit at y, which is calculated by x*z=y, then you get y-x to give yourself profit. 
But seriously, go back to 6th grade if you don’t understand.

2580 2018-01-04 12:58:30 The issue with cryptocurrency investments is not the level of risk, but the nature of your investment.  Stocks represent a claim on a company's future earnings.  Not sure what bitcoin gets you apart from speculation.
2581 2018-01-04 12:57:28 You referred to “Markets”, not me. If the view of equity investors and funds of the UK economy was as pessimistic as you assert, they would avoid stocks with a heavy exposure to the UK economy. They clearly have not taken that view. @EPCfuture @BrexitCentral

2583 2018-01-04 12:56:40 When only 50% of Americans benefit somewhat for having stocks, the real winners are the Oligarchs, not ALL American people as you spin it.  People have quit looking for work, when only the rich benefit.

2585 2018-01-04 12:54:41 This is very very false, crypto investing is definitely another form of investing. Whether its crypto, stocks, or options they're all investments that can make you good money. But crypto will make you the most if you play your cards right.

2588 2018-01-04 12:53:12 @AngelBrokingLtd as I mentioned in first tweet your agents are only making their brokerage and suggesting wrong/risky stocks to customers who trust them.
I request you to take appropriate action against all such agents and return my 56 thousand rupees ASAP.
2589 2018-01-04 12:51:27 I get that.  But that applies to anything: stocks, bonds, etc.  Can they not make them sign some document saying that they can't sue instead?

2592 2018-01-04 12:50:01 stock prices, market confidence that the companies would turn future profits, speculation in stocks by individuals, created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics in favor of basing confidence on technological advancements. مألوف؟
2593 2018-01-04 12:49:32 @AngelBrokingLtd, ur agents only think abt their brokerage, and not abt customer benifit. Before opening the account I told ur agent that I don't hv knowledge of share market, but he insisted me to open the account saying he will send me profitable stocks only. It never happened.
2594 2018-01-04 12:48:46 The DOW means something to anyone that owns stocks, mutual funds, etc. Around 50% of Americans do. However, to your point, about half that do don't have much invested. Nonetheless, investors are more likely to spend $ when DOW goes way up, which indirectly helps working class.
2595 2018-01-04 12:48:05 Buying out of favor stocks is like going to a party with only few people while Mr. market celebrating somewhere else. U have 2 options, waiting for MM to discover that your party have better alcohol & music and join in or u can join their crowded party. I rather the former

2624 2018-01-04 12:19:12 Then came the GFC. Stripped back, Rudd/Swan employed true Keynesian economics. Kick retail stocks by releasing liquid funds into the economy, then longer-term infrastructure to offset job losses. Both maintained vital market confidence. It was a textbook response.

2635 2018-01-04 12:09:05 the better term is crypto assets.  digital currency and crypto currency used colloquially are misleading. They are assets pegged to underlying protocol (fundamental) value. So in that sense they are like shares/stocks.

2771 2018-01-04 10:41:46 POTUS focus a lot on the market these days, he calls 25K on the dow with more upside potential. Back in the days one could see this as a contrarian indicator. Nowadays with the G3 printing 200B a month his call is actually  logical and rational. #stocks #trump #DowJones

2815 2018-01-04 10:03:18 Yes. But as it is economically not possible to let this happen, I wonder if it will just be collectively ignored. See the stocks of all chip producers being basically unaffected so far.

2822 2018-01-04 09:54:50 British fishing almost destroyed all our fish stocks pre-EU. Now most fish we catch is sold to the EU. That won't happen so much with brexit as every single fish would be subject, in theory, to customs and safety inspection (at a huge cost in time and money)
2823 2018-01-04 09:54:01 Stocks and the REAL economy are two very different things. One only helps those with enough to even invest, and leads to greater worker exploitation amongst those without two dimes to run together (aka the majority of Americans).

2847 2018-01-04 09:36:18 As you may know, in a typical IPO, underwriters such as @GoldmanSachs assess the value of the stocks and come up with numbers, for this they charge fees, typically a percentage of the money raised through IPO. #spotify is skipping this method and going with it’s own assessment

2920 2018-01-04 08:47:35 The problem is that “marketcap” is nonsense for crypto. So you can’t really compare that to marketcap for stocks (which is also a bad measurement, but better than in $crypto) so the market is MUCH smaller than BS marketcaps would otherwise indicate.

2929 2018-01-04 08:40:51 Ocado share price was around £4.50 in July 2015.

It took 2 years to get down to £2.47 on November 2017. (Ocado is/was one of the most shorted stocks on FTSE.)

It’s taken ~6 weeks to get to £4.34 today & it’s still going up.

2978 2018-01-04 07:57:12 I reacted to the data present in the tweet - which reads like a forecast. For potentially spectacular intra-day trades look for breakouts in volatile stocks going through an unusually narrow range. Easy to spot in 5-15 min charts over a 3-day period. Tweak all numbers as desired.
2979 2018-01-04 07:56:54 those people who tweet “your mcm believes bitcoin is the future” “your mcm thinks stocks are a 9-5” are the ones who invested in a random currency without doing research and lost all their money so now they mad about it lmao

1. Do you buy when valuations are at 2SD+?
2. If yes, then stocks or mutual funds or ETFs?
3. If stocks, then how many and which ones?
4. If mutual funds, then large cap or mid/small cap?
5. If ETFs, then which ones?

3042 2018-01-04 07:00:19 It is highly unusual for any commodity, let alone a currency, to appreciate by 1,410 percent year-on-year. The average market gain for all stocks is around 7 percent, so it is no wonder that a great deal of discussion has centered around the cryptocurrency.

3076 2018-01-04 06:28:52 Ok, not your fault. One should carry a trade at his own risk. But in my view, we should follow fundamentals and not momentum in this bull market. Market will give opportunity to accumulate good fundamental stocks 2-3 times a year. Day, extreme short term trade is risky.

3081 2018-01-04 06:22:12 Yeahh. But what I meant was Intel's stocks are dropping seriously and AMD's is rising. If Intel as a company dies then there's no competition for AMD.

3159 2018-01-04 05:34:26 @ICICI_Direct why is it I can't buy some specific stocks from your platform which other online broking firms allows.. I called RM and I was given reason that it might be not be  recommended stock.. haha .. seriously? Message "Buy in this script is currently not allowed:"
3160 2018-01-04 05:29:34 for online shop, sab ksoul/korean craze probably has it for preorder, and cna though idk if they still have stocks available bc they always run out of stocks
3161 2018-01-04 05:29:18 But why you giveaway such big prizes??? Do you have stocks leader?? And the winner is made who just opened his account for the sake of your contest with hardly 5 RTs... This is a Cheating... To increase fans. Instead there are follower increase technique by giving Monet use that
3162 2018-01-04 05:28:50 Millennials and GenXers are still drowning in student loans, the economic inequality gap continues to widen, the upcoming generation faces bleak job prospects...all while corporate profits and stocks rise. So stop celebrating Dow25k. It’s meaningless.

3185 2018-01-04 05:13:54 When/what would make the market stop drooling? Honest question. He plays carrot-and-stick to keep investors on their toes. Tweets to manipulate stocks. Someone take the toddler away from the steering wheel!

3188 2018-01-04 05:13:12 First, most of ur followers don't own stocks. Second, many of ur followers have dropped out of the job market and are now on welfare or disability. When u take away their entitlements, they will run from u like rats in a sinking ship. Good luck with that, tRump.

3200 2018-01-04 05:03:29 It is like the .com stocks.   You can close your eyes and throw a dart, and basically get a winner.   Don't get too greedy and sell if the profit is good, because I had seen coins that have fallen so fast and don't get back up.

3205 2018-01-04 04:59:37 Yes the stock market will likely rise because the millions that the billionaires save in taxes will be used to buy stocks which will raise the stock prices...which btw does not in any way help people who do not own those stocks.
3206 2018-01-04 04:59:20 We have two videos coming out this week on youtube. The first one is going to be on the basics of options and nadex, so if you're interested I would go over stocks and make sure you understand that first. The second video will be on the technical analysis (TA) of trading.

3211 2018-01-04 04:55:57 That's right..
That's why many of them work 2 or 3 jobs,and much of that goes to taxes. Republicans are totally out touch with 98% of americans everyday plight. Trump keeps talking about stock mkt. the average american can't afford to invest in stocks.They rather have #healthcare

3220 2018-01-04 04:50:25 ALSO: There's a historical exception allowing "dangerous and unusual" weapons to be banned. I'm sure bump stocks count, I think a case could be made for fistload weapons, but it might not be a strong one. If you want to challenge a ban on fistload weapons, you'll probably win.

3264 2018-01-04 04:28:38 Who cares if there is a contribution to 'society' when we buy/sell stocks? I do my part to help others, but when I buy a stock for $30, and sell it for $50, because of the time and guts and capital I put into it, why should that specific act require contribution other than taxes?
3265 2018-01-04 04:27:13 A good way to see that would be to check the "impact cost" of the stocks in the portfolio. And see at what point do they start impacting. Getting in and out of some small caps can be very tough. That friction itself erodes a lot of returns which are not visible in cute backtests

3275 2018-01-04 04:19:56 #AurionPro - One of the Multibagger stocks issued last January and was to be accumulated at 150 and below. 
At 270 odd now. 
Original Target stated at that time was 382. 
Very Much Intact.
3276 2018-01-04 04:18:51 Only for haters like you. The rest of us are fine. Stocks are great, more jobs, lesser taxes now, law and order back, etc etc
3277 2018-01-04 04:17:38 thanks for great work . However #toronto  home prices are beyond reach of most people.  Can we ban foreign millionaires/billionaires from buying properties , they treat these properties as stocks / gold bars
3278 2018-01-04 04:17:10 I own multiple stocks with my husband we are investors we love it 
3279 2018-01-04 04:16:56 Stocks will crash due to the surge in crypto market!!
3280 2018-01-04 04:16:27 Maybe with all that extra $ I will get from those temporary middle class tax cuts I can invest it! Know of any popcorn penny stocks ?

3284 2018-01-04 04:14:26 Try not to look at cryptocurrency like it's stocks. It's completely different
3285 2018-01-04 04:14:11 the more i learn about stocks the more im scared hahaha lol
3286 2018-01-04 04:13:46 tRump gloating about stocks going up well he's right on one stock, popcorn.  After all this crap going on, I need to buy me a few hundred shares.
3287 2018-01-04 04:13:43 When stocks are too euphoric bullish or extremely bearish, markets teach many naïve and seasoned investors lots of human emotions. For starters, naivety followed by greed and fear. Then, overconfidence, stubbornness, righteousness of which leads to jealousy, good and bad winners,
3288 2018-01-04 04:13:34 It's based on EMA and CCI breakouts, means when EMA alignment takes place or CCI becomes > 100 for the first time it will indicate. Also it gives you daily and weekly strength candles of screened stocks, observe stocks where cci and ema bo is 1
3289 2018-01-04 04:12:44 Hey.  You are talking my to a person who buys leveraged futures w/ puts on the S&P, Gold, Oil & the VIX.

I think bonds are going to crash once CPI moves up.  Investors are holding too much fixed income but stocks are parabolic so I roll with it.

3296 2018-01-04 04:07:54 Oh great, more money for those rich enough to own stocks. You are good at fooling people. Remember--You can fool some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time but never all of the people all of the time.

3300 2018-01-04 04:03:41 #KPTI. Why the intel’s CEO has sold all his stocks???
3301 2018-01-04 04:03:31 nah you should go buy stocks
3302 2018-01-04 04:03:30 I’ve said it before and will say it again. BTC needs to split like stocks so that it  looks “affordable” to noobs.
3303 2018-01-04 04:03:14 I love when same people alway on same stocks

3309 2018-01-04 04:00:31 There's a lot of talk debating ACB vs WEED. Short term v long term investing, performance v speculation, etc . Super volatile stocks. Originally I said I'd sell at 8$, then said 10$ was too high to buy...sitting at 14$...#crazy #whoknows
3310 2018-01-04 03:58:56 My weed stocks are up 300%
3311 2018-01-04 03:58:41 I am still riding dips on some stocks, and trying to be as patient as...well, just being patient. LOL!
3312 2018-01-04 03:58:31 But Mike look at penny stocks. There are 1000's. We now have approx 1300 coins. Think about how lucky we are. I can throw a dart and hit a bullseye

3315 2018-01-04 03:56:17 The stock market has very little to do with the economy at Large. Only 10% of the country is invested in stocks in any meaningful way, and 40% of that is in the hands of the 1%. This is not going to benefit 90% of us in any lasting fashion

3318 2018-01-04 03:55:40 At first I felt it was too good to be true . But IMO it is the beginning. Will continue to watch all marijuana stocks .
3319 2018-01-04 03:54:39 Pls focus on reducing operator driven stocks...u will sort out most of the red...from the root...
3320 2018-01-04 03:54:26 Thanks I will try catching up I'm looking on YouTube learning about stocks, Buffett, and I'm gonna grind so I can make strides. I been following people on Twitter and the lingo had me lost so I slowed down on following so many people on here.
3321 2018-01-04 03:54:13 I just found this.  Can I still order po? Do you have extra stocks?
3322 2018-01-04 03:53:21 Budz has been crazy! Still fell it just keeps going . Marijuana stocks continue to soar . Is chance of a life time . Don’t miss out.
3323 2018-01-04 03:51:22 Low priced rock star.  Imagine the volume of trades they would get.  
3324 2018-01-04 03:51:17 I recently invested on stocks based on cryptos but cant take on that much risk, which sets me back on marijuana stocks. 

But just the thought of getting that return makes me double think things! 
3325 2018-01-04 03:50:55 Stocks and stock funds was up 3.4%.
3326 2018-01-04 03:50:24 Nifty : 10450.75 up by 7.55 points (0.07%)

3328 2018-01-04 03:49:44 Should I sell some of my stocks to get a new hat?
3329 2018-01-04 03:49:20 All the stocks in focus:
Opening Trade: #BankofMaharashtra up 7%; #CentrumCapital up 3.2%; #LakshmiVilasBank up 1% & #AllahabadBank in RED
3330 2018-01-04 03:48:52 I guess when the government owns 40% of the stocks and almost all of the bonds, have a debt to GDP of 300% and in imploding population why wouldn't stocks be heading up.
3331 2018-01-04 03:48:39 Can you imagine if it makes it on coinbase
3332 2018-01-04 03:45:22 I like to learn about stocks
3333 2018-01-04 03:45:09 Good idea cause one shouldn't put all their eggs in one basket. Also be prepared to get rich slowly so stick to boring quality stocks - focus on the dividends
3334 2018-01-04 03:44:50 Made my first move of 2018. Concerned with the 9% drop of Redfin (RDFN)I sold my position to retain a 21% gain.

Bought a share of Ladder Capital Corp (LADR). Also looking at 8point3 Energy Partners (CAFD) as another buy soon.

3335 2018-01-04 03:44:12 Lmaooo I hope u know I’m entirely joking.  I have a shoebox savings, stock portfolio, and a bank savings.  Just not as much in the bank savings cause I moved most of it into stocks recently
3336 2018-01-04 03:43:11 Put them in the stocks first for a month on main street. One piece of bread and water daily. . . okkk and a multivitamin.
3337 2018-01-04 03:43:10 AMD’s stocks are already up.
3338 2018-01-04 03:43:03 So those who prepare the food, stocks the shelves, shovel the drivethru, clean the floors/bathrooms/tables don't make "hard earned" money? If you want a strong economy then the majority class (the working class) needs a living wage. You are grossly misinformed.
3339 2018-01-04 03:42:56 Everyone benefits when the stock market is up. Most 401Ks and other savings plans are partially invested in stocks, that's why they are better than a savings account. The risk is higher, but so are the rewards.
3340 2018-01-04 03:42:31 Between bitcoin and pot stocks it's pretty refreshing that everyone has moved on from being a Toronto real estate investment expert.
3341 2018-01-04 03:41:47 Who cares about the stock market? Do you own millions of stocks? If your pension plan benefits from a stock-market hike, you boss will plunder it, or give a few of your lucky colleagues early retirement. You don't benefit
3342 2018-01-04 03:41:37 GLOBAL OVERNIGHT SQUAWK WRAP: U.S. stocks climbed to record highs, gold fell and the dollar extended gains as the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting showed officials continued to back gradual interest-rate increases.
3343 2018-01-04 03:41:36 GLOBAL OVERNIGHT SQUAWK WRAP: European stocks rose following a positive session in Asia and bonds gained as the region’s new investment regulations finally took effect.
3344 2018-01-04 03:41:12 Real estate and stocks all 2018. Gettin wealthy one way or another promise you that
3345 2018-01-04 03:40:39 Great - So the rich who the tax cut bill will now also benefit now benefit on their stocks which the middle class don't have cause they're just trying to eke out a living. What about all this help u were going to give the middle class?  LIES!!
3346 2018-01-04 03:40:33 The #GOPTaxBillScam just poured a mix of sugar and cocaine on the stock market. It will run wild while corporations buy back stocks and pay out dividends, and then the high will end and it will come crashing down.
3347 2018-01-04 03:39:36 Copy practically writes itself. "Top ten stocks your ex doesn't want you to buy"

3349 2018-01-04 03:38:57 Which weed stocks are good value? Thanks
3350 2018-01-04 03:38:30 Your supporters don't give a damn about the Stock Market because they don't own any stocks, bonds or Mutual Funds. They can't afford it.
3351 2018-01-04 03:38:08 @HamzahKingKhan don't waste your time on stocks or options
3352 2018-01-04 03:37:22 Yes, but most people, who don’t even have stocks, are so stupid they think it’s a big deal. That’s why the 1% got a tax break. The stock market wasn’t giving enough. NOT.
3353 2018-01-04 03:34:26 Stock market had a good day?? Then why did my stocks go down?!?!?!
3354 2018-01-04 03:34:18 Navkar Corporation: Ashish Kacholia & Everest Finance and Investment company bought 0.7% of equity stake i.e 10 lakh shares each. The stock closed ~7.5% higher in yesterday’s trade. #stocks #stock #Nifty
3355 2018-01-04 03:32:01 @willis_andrew Hello Mr Willis.  I just read your piece on cannabis stocks, and I agree. This is a plant anyone can grow. It's not difficult. These stocks are a bubble at best. I would have preferred you to use the word cannabis and not "marijuna" tho. Good article.
3356 2018-01-04 03:31:59 Last I checked the stock market has hit a new record high 87 times since election night. Coincidence? I think not. #stocks #NASDAQ #winning
3357 2018-01-04 03:31:17 Buy buy buy and then complains about margin calls. #stocks
3358 2018-01-04 03:30:03 My Amazon (#amazonwashingtonpost) stocks reached a new high. Thanks, Obama!
3359 2018-01-04 03:29:32 Stocks are #bitcoin for old men
3360 2018-01-04 03:29:14 I think it can go up a lot more, but this is not one of the stocks I am watching, so at first glance, I think I missed my opportunity to get on board. If it goes back down below 5500 or even 5350 I might get on again.
3361 2018-01-04 03:29:07 Haha.. no concrete rules in mrkt..  make your own successful ways and strategies..  no matr what u r doing... finally u need to end up with cash 10% returns on margin 5 times in different stocks gives u 50% returns ..which is even possible in trade..
3362 2018-01-04 03:28:49 They have been sitting on a tin of cash that is why stock market has been strong they could have given out $ long ago raised pays etc instead of buying back stocks etc they want to suck up bcz they will want more
3363 2018-01-04 03:28:29 @XexodusX if youre going to chase pot stocks go with beleave on its dip; $acb wants it but $APH.CA has first dibs yw.
3364 2018-01-04 03:28:06 1. Some interesting insights on some FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet); i.e. stocks that, according to popular opinion, are emblematic of a bubble in US equities:
3365 2018-01-04 03:27:30 The strategy I feel most comfortable with is to have $100K in VTSAX before I start buying individual stocks.  Once that $100K is in place, let's play a little.  I also know my way is not the only way.  Investing is like skiing.  There's many great lines to take down a mountain.
3366 2018-01-04 03:27:06 Here’s the thing,those of us in the “healthy” mid income level that have been able to invest, yes we get to reap some profits- but at who’s expense? Poor can’t always help being poor, and these cuts and increases in stocks do NOTHING for them.
3367 2018-01-04 03:27:02 Top 5 FNO Observations - 

1000 cr worth index futures shorted by FIIs.
BankNifty futuers added 14% in OI.
7 stocks already in FNO Ban.
JETAIRWAYS, ADANIENT, TATACHEM added longs.

3371 2018-01-04 03:25:05 Fantastic play by the Dolphins, Don Stocks  Greatest Game ! He lit up the Orange Bowl that night! We could have Won that game had our FG kicker made it when when we need him to at the end!
3372 2018-01-04 03:25:03 As long as someone younger is perpetually willing to continue to pay for those inflated gains. If we were talking stocks, we would have to use a word that starts with "p" and rhymes with "onzi."

3375 2018-01-04 03:24:17 This would be like messing up a wet dream. I gave Amber Stocks a pass the first year because that was her first year. I am growing concerned that they will take Deshields
3376 2018-01-04 03:24:06 Imagine a brokerage company bigger than Charles Schwab that only offers four "stocks." Meet Coinbase: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum. Weird times, but indicates crypto has legs - even if it makes little sense.
3377 2018-01-04 03:23:49 And what law would’ve stopped that? Besides banning bump stocks which the nra supports. And you didn’t answer which laws make it illegal to study gun deaths

3380 2018-01-04 03:20:32 85% of stocks are owned by millionaires, so the middle class gets screwed over again.
3381 2018-01-04 03:19:31 Excited for #JPM18 , lots of great data being discussed. Some stocks will pop, some will drop.
3382 2018-01-04 03:18:17 Given that the SNB has been able to buy $80 bil or so US stocks, who's to say that they, the Fed, etc couldn't permanently extend the "bull market"?  The power of unlimited money creation makes almost anything possible.
3383 2018-01-04 03:17:52 Simplicity in life is good. It's good for you. It's good for your family. Strive for simplicity. Simplicity in the markets also helps. "Only the still pool reflects the stars." #stocks #investing
3384 2018-01-04 03:16:56 You just made me calculate my numbers!  Cool!  I have like 10% cash.  60% real estate.  25% stocks.  5% miscellaneous.
3385 2018-01-04 03:16:35 The stock market means nothing to the average person. The stock market only helps the very wealthy. 60% don't even own stocks
3386 2018-01-04 03:15:09 You can get your fix at anytime 24/7! Read and track the different coins! Flip them just like the Otc! You got the stocks down same basics.. to easy for a pro like you!
3387 2018-01-04 03:15:00 stocks shmocks
3388 2018-01-04 03:14:08 And a lot of “penny” stocks, and exposure to non-federally compliant companies, we think the best opportunities when federally legal will be in M&A with existing #tobacco and alcohol industries.
3389 2018-01-04 03:13:55 Total assets? Or are you saying your 100% cash no stocks at all at this point?
3390 2018-01-04 03:13:31 Stocks are over inflated.  What goes up will come down
3391 2018-01-04 03:12:32 It’s like a group of stocks in a single offerings... so a ETF might  have a percentage of Apple, Intel, Google, Amazon and other stocks sold at a certain price
3392 2018-01-04 03:12:24 No doubt the stock market on an upward trend.  Investors buying stock in anticipation of dividend increases and buy-backs.  How does this help those who do not own stocks?  The middle class & lower-income people.  Minimum wage stagnant.
3393 2018-01-04 03:11:57 Lasa supergenerics suggested by us at Rs 131 in Dec 2017 is now at Rs 206 
Yet available at just 10x FY20E
Valuation looks cheap even now if compared with Hester Bio Sequent And NGL Fine chem 
We love unglamouros and unloved stocks this is our stock mantra guys
3394 2018-01-04 03:10:48 The stock market only helps your rich friends and other rich investors. The average American barely has enough money to cover mortgage/rent and bills and living expenses. We do not invest in Stocks. Has no one told you this?
3395 2018-01-04 03:10:15 I'm conditioned to get out at 100%. That's why I can do good in crypto but not stocks. I look at the price point and go from there. Imagine getting in at .002 in xrp? Wasn't that long ago. Just think what $2000 would be worth now. This is the year Mike

3397 2018-01-04 03:09:44 The rich keep getting richer. The poor will get even poorer if you have your way. The middle class is in more debt than ever before just trying to survive. Most of your base doesn’t even own stocks. Maybe they’ll wise up.

3401 2018-01-04 03:08:24 @AndrewLCitron  You're just a weasel who drives selected stocks down at your command. SEC should take a close look at your tactics to propagate downside trading.  Hong Kong market has your number.

 4. The uranium stocks in the U.S. owned by Uranium One still remains in the U.S. and has not been moved to Russia.

3410 2018-01-04 03:04:03 have you tried stocks? workin wall street?
3411 2018-01-04 03:03:14 How many companies bought back stocks?
3412 2018-01-04 03:02:48 Though I agree with you in principle, stocks are priced on future earnings potential not past earnings. Tax plan certainly means a bump in future earnings. But worth current valuations? I'm not going that far.
3413 2018-01-04 03:02:26 That doesn't hurt either. Also, the increase in excess reserves (from a lower TGA) has helped tighten USD currency basis, allowing the foreign beneficiaries of QE to more cheaply swap into USD and bid up US stocks.
3414 2018-01-04 03:02:23 You hear about some penny stocks companies adding “Blockchain” to their names and getting massive pumps? Dumb but smart at the same time.
3415 2018-01-04 03:01:29 I don't think any other administration has had such an infatuation with the stock market. What stocks have you invested in? Give me some tips, we can both prosper.
3416 2018-01-04 03:01:23 I thought this was awesome news! Thanks for the update Barry.

3423 2018-01-04 02:59:58 In theory, could all capital requirements be made by a better designed bond market? Willing buyers and sellers of stocks don't make a contribution to society though.
3424 2018-01-04 02:59:58 Mop them up at a level, make sure whoever wants to get out sells and then move them up to the next level in search of more paper.
There seems to be strong undrlying demand for what will be one of the stocks of 2018.
3425 2018-01-04 02:59:01 Down y/y yes, but I'd still characterize a $500B annual run rate as strong. BTW, not saying buybacks are the only reason stocks go up, or that capex is zero, but they're a big reason for the low vol bull market in equities.
3426 2018-01-04 02:59:01 Stocks are so 2017
3427 2018-01-04 02:57:01 I am have 60 cents more a week! OMG! what stocks should I buy? This proves your tax cut is for the rich! @POTUS44 @HillaryClinton @SenSanders
3428 2018-01-04 02:56:56 About 40% of stocks you buy will pullback near your initial buy point-sometimes on big volume-for one or two days. Don't get scared out on this normal yet sharp pullback in price.   As long as your loss cutting point has not been reached.

3429 2018-01-04 02:56:38 It’s just digital currency. I’m sure you heard of bitcoin last month. These like the little brothers of bitcoin. You can buy and trade them just like stocks. You start by downloading coinbase and then transferring however much you wanna invest to there. Finna dm you a video.
3430 2018-01-04 02:56:37 Crypto is different from Stocks.  Market cap is barely relevant.  Potential and "FAITH" play a huge part in the price.  Technology backs many of these coins, but NOTHING backs the US Dollar.  Except FAITH.  2018 will be an amazing year for Crypto mark my words.
3431 2018-01-04 02:56:28 Where are jobs for seniors that companies don't want to hire simply because they are seniors?  Then you will take Medicare & Social Security away which will leave MANY MANY seniors HOMELESS, SICK or DEAD.  #TaxScamBill AGAIN, MOST can't afford to buy stocks & don't have 401ks
3432 2018-01-04 02:56:28 I'm in the middle class, and I do have stocks. The fact that healthcare and other programs will be cut, so they can line the pockets of the rich is wrong. The wealthy are receiving huge breaks. Over a few years, many in the lowest class will see increases in taxes. That's wrong.
3433 2018-01-04 02:55:22 Stocks haven't looked this good since 1928.
3434 2018-01-04 02:55:06 Could you please let us know how many of these great companies are now announcing layoffs and how many are buying back their own stocks? Asking for a friend.

"Hey man, you know about stocks, right?"

I nodded. 

"Do you think taking an advance on my credit card and buying stocks with it is smart?"

I shook my head. 

That was 2013. I was wrong. Lol

3440 2018-01-04 02:53:17 What kind of EPS do you think we'll get for 2018 with tax cuts? Sam Stovall says $155, meaning EY = 5.71%. That's LERP = 1.47%, and stocks are massively underpriced. $155 sounds like a crazy number to me, though.

3442 2018-01-04 02:52:39 Some of them 40 companies laid off 1000s & them bonus are not going to bottom level employees, and a great amount of ur base don't have a job to RECIEVE a bonus nor invest into stocks
3443 2018-01-04 02:51:43 Hear me out: When Dow hits 25k tomorrow we should just call it the end of stocks and rotate all the money in the world into a basket of cryptocurrencies.
3444 2018-01-04 02:51:30 It's absolutely true. Equities have had a good run since February, 2009, and it could very well continue in the near term, although it feels like a correction is overdue. I'm just curious if you know what percentage of your supporters are actually invested in stocks.
3445 2018-01-04 02:49:40 The CEO sold his stocks on November 29 and this was apparently known since November 14.

3450 2018-01-04 02:47:26 As far as i understood the market, there are seasons. Those who were or still are stock specific(micro,small & midcap) would have increased their wealth for sure. Especially in Dec.Many MF houses are stopping their sip in these lines. #nifty #Stocks
3451 2018-01-04 02:47:13 Stock markets rises are not economic recoveries. They're largely based upon hype and speculation. One would rather have a radical trust-busting effort along with rapid protectionist legislation & pro-union laws. That would send stocks down but be a long-term financial investment.
3452 2018-01-04 02:47:11 I remember fall in DJIA on Nov 02, 2016 when you won Presidential election. Stocks have spectacular since then. #djia
3453 2018-01-04 02:46:49 Oh I see.  Thank you for the information.  Another question...if I use my TFSA for something like stock purchases and I receive interest on those stocks, and it's automatically deposited in my TFSA, does that sum of money from the interest count as a contribution by me?
3454 2018-01-04 02:46:26 Investing and Trading; also interesting. From investing into small local businesses in the community, to investing and trading in stocks and cryptocurrency. It's all a space to be explored and learned.
3455 2018-01-04 02:45:48 (Help, I'm in a nutshell), fossil fuel stocks are already underperforming the stock market and are risky and overvalued due to the growing carbon bubble. The end.
3456 2018-01-04 02:45:21 Yeah I know. I only scalped and got out early with a very small profit. Got impatient. If it hold strength and the moving average goes up, I’ll probably pick some up on a dip day. I just didn’t wanna hold any stocks over the holidays  because I’m traveling

3465 2018-01-04 02:41:44 Quarterly Dec 17 4C cashflows are starting to be produced.Most reports will hit the market towards the end of Jan 18.Always a good idea for stocks you hold or are interested in to do a cashflow forecast to get an idea of how the company will perform.

3469 2018-01-04 02:38:31 You do realize most people in this country aren't rich and don't own stocks.  They are interested in wage growth, healthcare, and social services.  Your tax cut will cause inflation further hurting the majority of Americans.  Isn't that great!

3577 2018-01-04 02:00:28 Yes, those big macro risks always exist in the stock market. That’s why investors expect bigger returns from stocks than from other investments.

3632 2018-01-04 01:18:10 It might be a semantic argument but I would call anybody who has a pension, 401k, or ira an "investor." In which case this short term characterisation is not an accurate description of "investors" (and investing in stocks is unequivocally great).

3645 2018-01-04 01:10:55 @QuietlySaving Finally I'm liquidating my Monkey Stocks portfolio, after 2+ years.  Very interesting experiment.  My Monkey stocks (BA, BAB, BAG, BARC, HMSF) underperformed FTSE significantly, but still made money!
3646 2018-01-04 01:10:30 But when aimed at the top tiers, it results in hoarding. More money in the stock market, stocks rise, then crash.
3647 2018-01-04 01:08:39 $M $TGT $BBBY etc Nice rally for some of these retail stocks lately but I continue to expect a pullback. Seeing no reason to rush in here.

3650 2018-01-04 01:06:47 You may consider pre-selecting a portfolio of stocks, say a few from each sector or ranking them based on trend strength on a regular basis.

3658 2018-01-04 01:02:11 Conviction stocks always test you the most before trying to take off once you lost your conviction to hold on.

3661 2018-01-04 00:59:37 I should have bought AMD stocks yesterday. At least I would have gotten something from this Intel bug-induced AWS rebootmaggedon.
3662 2018-01-04 00:59:25 Didn’t even have to work for this extra cash. Stocks are very risky I finally got lucky haha
3663 2018-01-04 00:59:08 Like they say... it's a market of stocks, not the other way around. But I do see your point. We could just have rotation from XLI and XLE into XLV and XLF. Not sure I see an ability for a large downside unless there is news.
3664 2018-01-04 00:57:49 @jimcramer As a recent college grad I really enjoy watching your show. I’m learning tons and I love the enthusiasm. I was wondering where are the best places to do research on stocks. Currently I use the Yahoo Finance App and I watch CNBC. Any other good places I’m missing?

3671 2018-01-04 00:50:16 ...not only a useful idiot but watch the markets. Yesterday, my humble stocks made $2K in one day. Ponder that and then multiply it by millions (or billions). There is a lot money being made by the richest of the rich in this country and THAT is why they are keeping him in power.
3672 2018-01-04 00:48:20 that's generally how this unfolds. "Stocks can't go down, Risk management? Please".  Then it begins.
3673 2018-01-04 00:45:55 MSM 2016: 'The #stockmarket will crash if Trump wins.'

3675 2018-01-04 00:43:55 I wonder how they patched their systems without the replacement chips that currently don't exist & need to be designed. They sound like PR statements to keep the stocks from crashing right now & exploiting the none technology savvy investors.
3676 2018-01-04 00:43:23 really raise wages? they will take their extra 15% into their stocks not give it to employees in salary increases lets wait and see, what koolaid are you drinking anyway

3683 2018-01-04 00:37:22 If the stocks for bitcoins starts to decrease there’s no way to translate that into paper currency. That’s what worries me I’ve had a few conversations with people that are pitching new companies saying they’re “the new bitcoin”.
3684 2018-01-04 00:37:12 Yea I messaged Razer was told stocks will be back next week but I already used my money for something else so I just changed my mind about the headset

3686 2018-01-04 00:35:59 Owners are willing to invest in personal real estate, stocks, bonds and toys but not in the employees that make these business owners their incomes . I bet a big portion of those minimum wage increases will be spent @TimHortons! #disappointed!

3694 2018-01-04 00:31:13 In this market, after a 2 day move like this, I don't look for stocks to short. I look for stocks that I need to own the next time they dip.
3695 2018-01-04 00:30:51 IDK about y2k though. Y2K should have only effected stocks negatively leading up to new years. After the world didn't end people probably bought more stocks blowing the bubble up even more. but idk
3696 2018-01-04 00:29:51 The noose is tightening around your neck.Everyone is turning against you. Stupid, idiot, lazy, or how the government works. AND THIS IS FROM YOUR FRIENDS! You think just hollering out stocks are up! Jobs!And your base just swells with pride. Even they will eventually catch on.
3697 2018-01-04 00:27:14 He's in a fantasy world. Remember that this is a cult stocks and that pitcher of Kool Aid that he uses as his picture is intended to be ironic but it's really literal. The dude has gone off the deep end and there's lots of grumbling fro the "offline coward network."

3700 2018-01-04 00:25:03 I remember that episode of POI about wall street where the end was supposed to be like "wowzer, what a twist ;)))" but most viewers who don't know how the hell money and stocks and wall street works were like
what?? is happenning?
3701 2018-01-04 00:24:25 There were gat crank triggers used?  First I heard of this!  There were bump stocks, but haven’t heard confirmation from police reports that they were used!
3702 2018-01-04 00:24:10 No in my opinion... The dotcom bubble took ~5 years as well...
Shorting is inherently speculative. Even if you are right, it could take a really long time to play out.
A right short thesis doesn't make a stock a good short - best to stay away from popular, cult stocks...
3703 2018-01-04 00:23:06 I deserve a smack in head with a dead halibut for selling Kidman Resources. I rooly do. #sigh #asx #stocks #ausbiz

Be nice to see Kyrgios get his head right also thenAust tennis could be on the up !! #australiantennisneedsqualityplayersintopten
3707 2018-01-04 00:22:01 When my tax check come this year I’m trying to flip it for real I’m buying stocks and digital currency
3708 2018-01-04 00:21:20 Excellent reply Kid and the view that stocks are like baseball cards or pitching pennies is why most people's returns are well below the market averages year in and year out.
3709 2018-01-04 00:20:37 @cryptomocho  Hey Mocho, random noobie question, dont you think that reinvesting all (put money, profit like 5%, then reinvest all over and over) is more profitable than hodling? (like some pros do with stocks)
3710 2018-01-04 00:16:46 well i done swing trading  most of the times with stocks only once with bitcoin when it was getting hype but i stopped about 3 moths before i realized i need some study
3711 2018-01-04 00:16:30 (and also that intel higher-ups illegally sold off their stocks ahead of this becoming public knowledge, lol)
3712 2018-01-04 00:12:18 Thanks rhum ill pass this one as i do not have an energy stock in my portfolio ill let someone who needs a TA done on an energy stock take this one
3713 2018-01-04 00:11:46 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
3714 2018-01-04 00:11:09 I know this isn't real stocks. but $POWR trades like a low float stock. When it gets any volume it fucking goes.
3715 2018-01-04 00:10:27 Who hasn’t dismantled things? Look at our stocks. We have the least amount of unemployment we’ve seen in over 10 years. Also recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He’s been in office a year. Give him time support him until his 4 Years is up then vote for someone new
3716 2018-01-04 00:10:14 Reminded me of Tipper Gore & Parents Music Resource Center. But they, I think, honestly thought they were doing a good thing. This moron & his celebrity industry are unworthy of any defense. The reality of it is nauseating & so damaging. Put 'em in the stocks & throw garbage.
3717 2018-01-04 00:09:29 3) making America Great Again! Tax cuts, stocks up, illegal immigration down, unemployment claims at a 17yr low, stronger military
3718 2018-01-04 00:08:45 Blessed are the blockchain stocks.

3720 2018-01-04 00:06:55 70% of stocks owned by 1%! Why doesn't mainstream media pick on this? Do they represent them or the 99%??? Shame
3721 2018-01-04 00:06:54 I say we bring back tar and feathering or maybe public stocks so we can throw food at him.

3725 2018-01-04 00:05:26 I figure the soaking in $FYI will run its course over the next few.days

Likewise $BMN , but a longer wait .

Some of these stocks running atm are pip fodder , enjoy it while it lasts , the New Year rush of adrenalin
3726 2018-01-04 00:04:30 He's just mad his POS stocks are not on the up and up so fast. He's a big POS and buys a position later. F him
