92 2018-10-31 23:46:27 @Dave24karr I agree with you. We subsidize the bankers, the farmers,military contractors, oil companies etc. In my humble opinion, the reason this idea seems so radical to conservatives, is because they don’t want to have an educated population.

150 2018-10-31 23:36:01 I cook bacon with no shirt on so I can feel the pain of the cooking oil splashing on me. I’m into that kinky shit.
151 2018-10-31 23:35:47 i won't be suprised if USA support a war between Brazil and Venezuela, two countries with the biggest oil reserve in Latin America
152 2018-10-31 23:35:41 Westworld could have stepped up, except it jumped the shark in the S2 finale.
153 2018-10-31 23:35:41 Also it was 2.5% June July 2016. That was Obama’s. So now it’s up 1 point. Also heavy oil is not moving here. Tariffs on everything. Duh you think that might have an effect?
154 2018-10-31 23:35:41 If I get any trick or treaters tonight, I’m definitely getting egged. I have mini olive oil and salt and pepper shakers from the last hotel I visited.
155 2018-10-31 23:35:17 sounds great, a new and #healthier alternative to other #oil products on the market. #soybeans are a great alternative to #animal products, so the more of them grown the better the outcome for the #environment and consumers

156 2018-10-31 23:35:03 There’s only one solution to this calamity. Oil Wrestling!

@OilWrestleParty
157 2018-10-31 23:34:57 Are you sending an army? there is no oil there!!!
158 2018-10-31 23:34:48 Sure, and it usually goes the same. Ironically, neither are the major funders of either side, as those are the weapons, oil, and insurance companies. But they're not as intriguing as bad guys as the Kochs or Soros
159 2018-10-31 23:34:47 I’m the nigga a female you can call to do some light labor shit if necessary. Need a light/oil change oil change or something slight. If I know how to do it, I gotchu. Just pull up.
160 2018-10-31 23:34:37 PC's lol really come on should they be even allowed to ask questions or comment at this time. Any of you clowns watching Muskrat 24 billion oil revenues in 12 years and the debt doubled on there watch. They Should all climb under rock. Limbs doing a great Job keep it up
161 2018-10-31 23:34:32 Turns out, if an old bottle of lotion mysteriously leaks oil all over your bathroom and you still decide to USE IT for some reason, you will NOT like the way you smell. 

So today’s life lesson: if you’re 25 and bought the lotion in high school, consider throwing it away.
162 2018-10-31 23:34:11 かっこいい…
163 2018-10-31 23:34:08 CBD oil is amazing. I likewise experience great relief for my anxiety from it. I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone that suffers with their mental health. It's great to get the positive message out there.
164 2018-10-31 23:33:53 Are the stock issues with the dried product? I've had no supply issues with my oil at MedReleaf. This enrages me -- IT'S MEDICINE -- THERE SHOULD NOT BE STOCK ISSUES!!!!!!!!

166 2018-10-31 23:33:28 I found your suggestions on the coconut oil mixture to be quite helpful
167 2018-10-31 23:33:23 Making steam with black oil is a wonderful experience
168 2018-10-31 23:33:00 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying

174 2018-10-31 23:32:03 If I'm not mistaken, the work from Ivo Telley is with Drosophila extract (without microfluidics), and the two others (Good et al, Hazel et al) encapsulate Xenopus extract in oil droplets using microfluidics. All really cool work :)
175 2018-10-31 23:31:54 China is definitely papering over their problems. Who can trust their figures? Every time some analyst works out a new evaluation metric like studying electricity consumption, the government jukes the data. And wait till oil goes up another 20%...

195 2018-10-31 23:29:07 The ink in your tweet about the shooting in the temple is barely dry and already you're peddling to your gun crazies. Global warming, more oil. Gun crime, more guns. #scheercrazy #cdnpoli
196 2018-10-31 23:28:42 My jeep is scheduled for an oil and filter change tomorrow morning and the air filter and winterizing. I already purchased the oil and filters with intentions of doing it myself and decided not to in this wet weather. Only $25.00.  I'll get the 93% gas when I take the Jeep in.
197 2018-10-31 23:28:17 Wht baffles me must is..no matter how u mind ur business, tweet something reasonable, comments nicely...arewa twitters must fish out something negative abt it
198 2018-10-31 23:28:15 I seriously don't see how your ancestors have been warning us for 500 years about our over dependence on oil, coal use and massive population growth resulting in habitat loss.  If everyone was living as we did in the past we would have more sprawl, less land, less wildlife.
199 2018-10-31 23:27:28 I was primed since childhood to expect the Oil to Run Out. It takes time to unlearn this stuff... and learn what it was all based on.

202 2018-10-31 23:27:19 Hope govt oil companies do not hole common man's pocket only to burn stove's with no cooking. Our Rulers should step in
203 2018-10-31 23:27:13 i’m 20 years old & i don’t know how to change my oil, wow i’m failing at life
204 2018-10-31 23:27:12 Gasoline prices have dropped because the price of a barrel of oil/West Texas crude, has dropped from about $73 to $65, as of the closing of the stock markets on Wed. Oct. 31st.
205 2018-10-31 23:27:12 You can do that, can't hurt, but rather you could start taking Rick Simpson Oil, or RSO for short, the full plant spectrum extract.... The black stuff...

We have a shop near us where you can take your own jars and packaging. They have a peanut grinding machine so you can set how crunchy or smooth and grind them right into your own jar 

Not hydrolised so no trans fats, just occasionally mix the oil back in
208 2018-10-31 23:26:38 If only they had not discovered oil.
209 2018-10-31 23:26:18 I think it would need good veggie broth.  I wonder if miso would be a good addition.  Some braising in coconut oil too?
210 2018-10-31 23:26:09 I'd count the Oil Kings.

212 2018-10-31 23:25:55 My introduction to energy was Peak Oil in the mid 2000s. If you'd told me how abundant oil and gas would be towards 2020 I'd never have believed you.
213 2018-10-31 23:25:51 cheers bro wish they had some for oil money and empty seats, we’d be smashing stars then
214 2018-10-31 23:25:36 You know what’s scary? Getting charged $140 for an oil change. Like damn sir I’m sure am spooked.

220 2018-10-31 23:24:08 As to making the province better, economically we’re in full recovery from 2014 oil bust and are now leading the country in jobs and wages. I’m also delighted that they didn’t fire teachers and nurses and reinvested in infrastructure debt reduction. I didn’t vote ND but It’s good
221 2018-10-31 23:23:45 There is sustainable palm oil tho! X at least they try I suppose !!!
222 2018-10-31 23:23:44 I need a deeep back massage with some baby oil.

224 2018-10-31 23:23:35 Boiled taro and yuca and chicken w an olive oil drizzle. 

I love taro and yuca. Eating these foods makes me feel connected to my culture, nation, homeland. Makes my heart and tummy warm.
225 2018-10-31 23:23:31 I need a scalp massage with oil, in between my braids.
226 2018-10-31 23:23:30 I’ve tagged you in plenty of tweets. How familiar are you with the work the oil and gas industry does here in Alaska? With their safety and environmental practices. Do you know what responsible development looks like? Waiting... @standforalaska

234 2018-10-31 23:21:04 Govs say they can pay N22,500 which is less than $70. South Africa minimum wage is about $277, that's over N100k. We produce an average of 2.5M barrels of oil per day. South Africa does not have significant proven oil or gas reserves and produces oil&gas from coal& imported crude
235 2018-10-31 23:20:16 Tell me rock man. I'm just a dumb old Jarhead. Don't know nuthin' bout rocks.
I thought we had more oil and natural gas than than any one. Guess I'm wrong.
What about everything else? All is bad to Dems. All Trumps fault.
Sorry you let me upset you.
236 2018-10-31 23:19:57 No, clean all the flesh off those seeds, ad brown sugar, cumin, chili powder, butter, small amount of oil and roast until toasted. Yum

251 2018-10-31 23:17:58 When you put the power to save the planet in the hands of politicians then you've conceded the fight. Your @JustinTrudeau approved the Kinder Morgan pipeline and a second pipeline to follow. That's 173 billion barrels of oil--1/3 of the remaining carbon budget. Oil owns politics.

255 2018-10-31 23:17:39 Good question.....With this production surge oil seems to be at best a sideways trade....At least until depletion starts to end the rising trajectory of US oil production.
256 2018-10-31 23:17:32 Not sure if I'm having a hot flash or a mild allergic reaction to the essential oil blend I tried. Both are equally possible.

The Saudis should keep that in mind before they murder US Journalists and cut them up into pieces and lie about it.

282 2018-10-31 23:13:36 Huh. Even from what's portrayed in the sensationalist video, the left's America looks a lot more desirable - where people stand up against a fascist president and principles of freedom. A lot more desirable than coal mines and oil drilling.

290 2018-10-31 23:12:00 yes! cbd oil helps if you don’t want to smoke any & then smoking actual marijuana helps so much!! i have awful anxiety i take a heavy medication for anxiety every day, & smoking helps so much. there’s so many different strains that can help out with all different forms of anxiety
291 2018-10-31 23:11:41 Good. While you're at it, work to reduce crude oil, period.
292 2018-10-31 23:11:40 I can’t believe people fall for this snake oil salesman. He’s full of it...
293 2018-10-31 23:11:35 @kemiadetiba for president, @SolaSobowaleTKV for minister of oil. @AdesuaEtomiW for minister of women Affairs and logistics. After hearing a whole lot about king of boys,I carved out to go watch. The movie made my year. Maximum respect to every actors and actresses
294 2018-10-31 23:11:31 ? 
Provide the sources. Newsnight don't collect oil revenue figures.
295 2018-10-31 23:11:29 Oh I wish I'd thought of CBD oil!
296 2018-10-31 23:11:24 Harder for the other side when they don't really want to oppose the policies he does have. Big pharma, oil corps & weapon manufacturers donate to both sides. For a reason.

302 2018-10-31 23:10:28 Interestingly the 1.75% forecast was made before the recent spike in crude oil prices. What is we had bot had that spike?

305 2018-10-31 23:10:11 Is that olive oil? If it is, it’s a healthier choice than vegetable oil.
306 2018-10-31 23:10:04 I've seen snake oil on the shelves at Carrefore :)
307 2018-10-31 23:10:03 I wonder if the corn oil is from GMO corn (almost definitely) and what the BT (gmo endogenous pesticide that busts insect guts) count is like.
308 2018-10-31 23:10:03 Is it all peanut or is the oil replaced with vegetable oil?

Is the oil hydrolised

My were given CBD oil and are locked in the kitchen at the back of the house.
314 2018-10-31 23:09:20 Water can wet oil 
315 2018-10-31 23:09:18 Saudi Arabia needs the US more than we need them. Our country needs to keep searching for oil deposits and alternative fuels so our country continues to be energy independent. I still remember the oil embargo in ‘73.
316 2018-10-31 23:09:17 Body oil 
317 2018-10-31 23:09:13 You can put liquor, weed..and what ever you want in a hookah..cAnt do all that with a vape that just oil I think
318 2018-10-31 23:09:08 Lavender oil can help relax you if you diffuse it in your room, spray your bed/pillow or rub it on your temples after diluting it. Avoid activity and eating an hour or so before bed time (like that's always possible lol)
319 2018-10-31 23:09:08 And broken bridges, potholes in roads, a failing education system, the swamp of D.C lobbyist influence, a growing economy, being the #1 cruel oil global supplier, etc.

334 2018-10-31 23:06:54 Looks like snake oil, smells like snake oil...  
335 2018-10-31 23:06:50 6 more hours for me, but I think I'm gonna burn some of that midnight oil and try for at least a thousand words before bedtime. Shooting for 2500 before day's end though.

342 2018-10-31 23:05:18 Can you explain this math ? The US produces just over 11.2m bpd of oil and the consumption is close to 20m bpd. How do we get to almost zero ??
343 2018-10-31 23:05:10 Who wanna help me change my oil?

345 2018-10-31 23:04:31 Whqt tells you the NDP wants to close down oil? The way they fight for pipelines? The way they promote AB oil to the rest of the country and to the world? The way they lowered business taxes below Klein era? What specifically causes you to reach that conclusion?

347 2018-10-31 23:04:23 And now the world faces an existential crisis bc George not only ignored climate change (which Al Gore would not have done), but he blew up deficits on the follies of Iraq and Afghanistan, in pursuit of more oil.

359 2018-10-31 23:02:33 So why are you equating lower Oil revenues, which is a 100% **reserved** policy area with somehow Scotland being too poor to be independent?

Surely you can see that it's the UK gov mismanaging Scotland's Oil, when all other countries are raking in 10x the revenues, or more?

407 2018-10-31 22:54:57 You seem to think Scotland has only contributed positively toward the UK with Oil & Gas. This is not so. It used to contribute up to 80%+ of revenues toward England, long before it had struck Oil.
Why do you think the UK gov stopped releasing proper accounts around the 1920's?
408 2018-10-31 22:54:53 Because morons won't stop asking if we refuse to eat body parts they offer us and then continue to tell us about nutrients we aren't getting while stuffing their faces with burgers and deep fried chicken dripping in oil. Do think of something smarter, this has really gotten old.

436 2018-10-31 22:50:15 @sainsburys hi could you make 2019 the year all Sainsbury products containing palm oil were replaced by alternatives? How about an  inventory of all products and a deadline for suppliers to switch? Tropical rainforest destruction is a direct result of its use @Greenpeace @WWF
437 2018-10-31 22:49:49 i'd probably be a snake oil salesman
438 2018-10-31 22:49:48 Check engine light comes on TWO DAYS after I get an oil change and other car repairs... AND a car wash. Camillo, my son, you need a lesson in being grateful and also to learn to rip off the band aid quick... You'll understand what that means when you grow up
439 2018-10-31 22:49:33 In other news, I've decided that I am properly angry: Brexit - a monumental lie sold to people's prejudice; Trump and his outright klepto-fascist idocracy agenda; Big Oil's success with Fear Uncertainty & Doubt Vs. climate science.

We are witnessing the end of The Enlightenment.

449 2018-10-31 22:48:34 This fact could validate this new ALL meat diet that ppl r trying. Plants r in a way poisonous. Tho I think that's the part of the point of eating plants- they're just stimulating enough (once breed!) to that they're beneficial. Like sulfurophane in broccoli, or castor oil 4 ex.

452 2018-10-31 22:48:01 Yes, in the way many tend to go about the change. I’m all for alternative energy sources but not a one size fits all thing & we need to get off oil on a reasonable timetable unless you don’t care about people in flyover states away from infrastructure enjoyed in Seattle.

480 2018-10-31 22:44:43 @Tesco hello could you at Tesco do an inventory of all your products that use palm oil which is destroying vast swathes of tropical rainforest - and then find alternatives - I assume it’s cheap,a fact which it should raise concern environmentally. @WWF @Greenpeace

488 2018-10-31 22:43:58 Well G, here's the scoop. My "budtender" was a RN until she was diagnosed with the exact cancer I had at an early age. After much discussion, Murphy and I came home with some edibles and a tiny vapor pen with CBD and Indica oil in it. I will let you know how that goes....
489 2018-10-31 22:43:55 Peppermint oil repels fleas. Mix some up in a spray bottle with water and spray your floor.

495 2018-10-31 22:43:19 no the RUk supported Scotland in the preceding three financial years to the tune of some 25 plus billion in fiscal transfers - that isn't blindness - that is 45 dollar oil. It renders Scotland's oil uneconomic.
496 2018-10-31 22:43:14 Lol enjoy because i dont deal with nothing olive but olive oil lol
497 2018-10-31 22:42:57 Please? June 2011, he predicted a 20% drop in housing in 2012 with a resulting global recession. In October 2012 he predicted a global recession in 2013. August 2015, he predicted that the price of oil "is headed for $10 to $20 per barrel" (it was $43/barrel at the time).
498 2018-10-31 22:42:55 And Standard Oil made him pay for those views too.
499 2018-10-31 22:42:51 Occasionally, but mostly olive oil
500 2018-10-31 22:42:51 The oil companies are not interested in using their profits to transition the economy away from carbon. They are interested in giving them to the shareholders. This is observable behavior.

503 2018-10-31 22:42:18 @john_danfulani no discussion on Nigeria economy by APC or its supporters that does not refer to price of crude oil. Seems to me that capturing the oil economy was APC major target in 2015. Little wonder no one else is trusted to head the ministry.

The”Ted doesn’t speak Spanish”thing was debunked when he and Rubio exchanged words in Spanish during the primaries.
508 2018-10-31 22:41:48 ...make all that BS about it being an ethical alternative to Saudi Oil and good for the Canadian economy come true.
509 2018-10-31 22:41:35 Throughout those years, Norway has made 10's billions in revenue.
The UK gov is purposefully mismanaging Scotland's Oil (Unknown Region exports in the billions is a classic)
Even 2018, that 1.1bn would belong to Scotland, not the £100m it probably got allocated that year.

574 2018-10-31 22:33:14 @MaisarahMahmud hi kak mai, ive been trying double cleanse using cleansing oil for more than 1 week, then after 13 days i notice there are a few tiny bumps come out. Is it because of the clensing oil? Should i stop? Im using Nutox Cleansing oil btw

579 2018-10-31 22:32:41 Your Guru Weaver knows this. He is another snake oil salesman from a long line of them throughout history. By the way ask him to prove me wrong!
580 2018-10-31 22:32:30 @garlin what is your position regarding the Enbridge pipeline 5? That's 23 million gallons of oil a day running underneath Michigan Waters.
581 2018-10-31 22:32:26 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
582 2018-10-31 22:32:23 I thought she used CBD oil, which is legal in Oklahoma? Smoking it is one of the least effective medicinal methods and the instances in which that is the only way it can be used to treat a condition is very small from what I understand.
583 2018-10-31 22:32:08 Permanent snow cover over land that might have plants/trees or other natural resources(coal/natural gas/oil,etc)

593 2018-10-31 22:30:36 I do appreciate how once again I was the target of your ire though

597 2018-10-31 22:30:09 Irresponsible reporting. The truth is that the amount of CBD oil used differs for each person according to a blood test that should be administered before use. Giving everyone the same amount is just wrong. Shame on abc and the yoga studio
598 2018-10-31 22:29:58 There was an interview with Sachin Oza (Reabold Resources) recently in which he suggested that where oil markets are sanctioned they often find a way of getting the stuff onto the market - worth a listen (even if not interested in Reabold).

605 2018-10-31 22:29:27 I have 4ccccc hair so I add olive oil to my shampoo since shampoo naturally dries your hair out and before every wash I get a Walmart bag and olive oil my hair down and let it sit for a good hour but you can try different oils cuz olive is heavy monoi, castor etc

607 2018-10-31 22:29:15 They have a new build that is callled “air products” and Tesoro just build a whole new unit that helps with the oil. Called the CPUP As of another refiners building the c-pup with them. 
I always believed that the refineries are a main cause and how awful they are however,

611 2018-10-31 22:28:54 You may get cheap oil from the Islamic Republic.
But make sure our nation is going to revolution soon.

Europeans, just for your long term benefits (and not for Iranian people's human right, etc.) Ignore totalitairian government of IRI. Ignore your short term benefits, ignore low oil price. Do not decieve yourself. Choose people. A reasonable choice.
619 2018-10-31 22:27:35 We periodically have anti-fracking/pipeline protests in NYC, where there are still countless buildings that use heating oil.  One time I'm going to counter protest with a sign and chant "Burn more Diesel !"
620 2018-10-31 22:27:28 I’ve just heard the stories.  We’ve changed a few on this 535 over to the “new style” whatever that means.  You know, funny thing about oil bath bearings, if they are swimming in oil they rarely fail. 
621 2018-10-31 22:27:27 Big facts, just like an oil change is always the solution

634 2018-10-31 22:26:03 Yesterday I constructed an extremely primitive and extremely loud drum-set out of a 55-gallon metal oil barrel and two heavy sticks.  (The water cooler jug, used previously, was destroyed by my violent music.)  The devastating primordial reverberations communicate eternal truths.

638 2018-10-31 22:24:49 First day in Missoula, found a giant map of Montana literary icons and a random oil painting of a ship that the clerk at the thrift store insisted were a pair meant to be sold together. Feels like home already.
639 2018-10-31 22:24:41 Norway is not socialist.  They are a very wealthy oil state that bolted on some socialism.  Without the oil money they couldn’t do even that.  Mostly capitalist.

641 2018-10-31 22:24:39 Hammad @ImranKhanPTI why there is no complete stamp-down on  IMPORTS - stop all except for oil & medicines. Put your foot down on  SMUGGLING - no tolerance. Expand money supply in the market that would stabilize money stock value.

645 2018-10-31 22:23:13 Just recently, BP profits have doubled due to higher oil prices and new oil fields. Higher oil prices is not good for drivers especially in New Zealand where oil prices are expected to exceed $3 a litre. could now be the time to turn electric?

659 2018-10-31 22:21:46 No more constant service and oil changes will combat that argument easily. Also meaning more days in service rather than the shop.

672 2018-10-31 22:19:15 It's all fake. The market is volatile.  Jobs are not up. There are no new big industries. He should be supporting green renewable industries. Oil , gas and coal are things of the past.
673 2018-10-31 22:19:15 We are also “phasing out “oil and natural gas according to the same government, but no special deal for them. Consumers are paying more for gasoline due to carbon taxes. What is the difference?  Other than potential votes.
674 2018-10-31 22:19:10 Would walk in and just smile...get some water if not anointing oil, read psalm 24, 90 plus "Mark 16:17"... then I bind the spirit, cast it out and send it back to the pit, put that in Jesus Name.

It wasn’t only dropping gluten that helped. I was having horrible stomach cramps and diarrhea daily. I first dropped yogurt which helped tons. Then I started taking coconut oil gel caps and that stopped the diarrhea for the most part.

681 2018-10-31 22:18:37 If you think there's been a lot of deregulation going on, you're right. Interior Department says its already withdrawn 150 proposed rulemakings and finalized 19 dereg actions.

708 2018-10-31 22:16:20 Besides which heavy oil is high demand product. What you're suggesting is the producers stop making a product that has a high demand and good margins in favour of making a product that has no better than equal demand but has low margins. And the transport discount still exists.

717 2018-10-31 22:15:32  Up the exfoliation! 
As days become cooler it can lead to dryer skin. Dry skin makes your skin work in overtime to create more oil. This additional oil can cause clogged pores. Use a good exfoliant to clean the slate and remove dry skin during the Fall.

720 2018-10-31 22:15:15 Oil change, new oil filter, and when idling it only gay guy who finds gay pride to not be a good thing?
721 2018-10-31 22:15:14 just tried oil. ew.
722 2018-10-31 22:15:12 The US-Saudi war on Yemen was about capture of the enormous oil reserves in Yemen. With Saudi oil depleting fast, Yemen was a way out for Riyadh to fend off bankruptcy. James Mattis declared the Yemen war over but if the Saudis agree is another thing. The houthies won.
723 2018-10-31 22:15:08 Ear blocked with wax. Poured so much Olive Oil in there's now a bunch of tiny Italian chefs in there cooking up a feast.
724 2018-10-31 22:14:38 @JuliaHB1 @thecarolemalone @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump @MichelleDewbs So a journalist is murdered and children are dying in Yemen. The UK and US support Saudi Arabia to protect arms sales abs and oil. What price human life eh? You politicians should be fucking ASHAMED!!!
725 2018-10-31 22:14:34 I’m roman ambramovich, russian oil billionaire and philanthroper, how could these idiots not see that?
726 2018-10-31 22:14:22 All the GOP did was take away and rebrand Obama care and GOP snake oil salesmen are trying to buy your vote with what they took away saying you do not deserve it in my mind! But here vote for us and we will give you back what Obama gave you years ago,a lotta wasted time and effor
727 2018-10-31 22:14:22 another fact: muslims never engaged in suicide bombing it was against the quran prior to involvement in in syria and iran when we orchestrated the 1953 coup over oil, both of course are socialist countries.

729 2018-10-31 22:14:01 There's still a decent amount of them,  but it's not near as newsworthy when an eco terrorist (definitely left wing)  attacks a farm or oil company as it is when someone sends bombs to major politicians.
730 2018-10-31 22:13:53 Went to get an oil change and tire rotation on mom's car this morning lol for some reason the guy who sold her the car came over talked to her left and came back a minute later and hugged her she's like what was that about
731 2018-10-31 22:13:50 Unsurprisingly, you've completely misinterpreted.
David Cameron in the video explains it so simply even the dumbest of the dumb can understand: Scotland has over 90% of UK Oil geographically around its shores, but shares the revenues generally demographically within the UK....
732 2018-10-31 22:13:42 It takes forever and a day to get an oil change at the dealership 
733 2018-10-31 22:13:30 I dont like it. But i'm sure you like me have seen this movie 1 too many times and think. Before they completely go Oil and submarine all of JP's value they might as well trade magic beans. Such poor asset management.
734 2018-10-31 22:13:12 Rex Tillerson was US Secretary of State: February 1, 2017-March 31, 2018. What did he do before this? Headed up ExxonMobil 2006-2016. Why is that important? ExxonMobil ships its Chadian oil through the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline. Tillerson may be gone, but State Dept still attuned.
735 2018-10-31 22:13:08 @ryansbergara @shalexandej if u guys were truly dedicated to dying vision u would shave your heads and drink oil

739 2018-10-31 22:12:45 Get urself a guy who will change ur brakes, change ur oil, clean ur car and fix ur spoiler and license plate when he’s bored 
740 2018-10-31 22:12:31 They say ‘Money talks all languages’ 
It seems it speaks #oil #SaudiArabia 
I find it so outrageously disturbing & disgusting that the international governments have not broken off relations with the Saudis over the cold bloodied murder of #JamalKhashoggi
741 2018-10-31 22:12:30 It wasn't a case of LBJ "allowing" anything.  Those bullets were meant to show HIM who was REALLY in charge.  As to who those people were, research the assassination of Huey Long.  Particularly the role of Standard Oil.  You might be surprised.  Or not.
742 2018-10-31 22:12:08 It is time we had nothing to do with Saudi Arabia, they are a country living in the 4th century, they murdered a journalists in front of the world and are black mailing the west with oil, fuck them destroy them and take the oil for the world.
743 2018-10-31 22:11:53 Wouldn’t it be hilarious if custom at Halloween was not to ask for candy, but something very different and weird....like bungee cords, or olive oil? All things that will be super useful to these young folks in 25 years time...
744 2018-10-31 22:11:41 So it’s likely that the #uk #Government will do nothing about the disgraceful behaviour of #SaudiArabia probably because of #oil this is a joke, Saudi Arabia are bullies who are backward in their beliefs, time to stand up to them, it’s about more than money!
745 2018-10-31 22:11:40 Everyone knows that the Western Economies are not in any way dependent on oil, gas or money. Everyone knows this. The wars in the Middle East have purely been fought on religious grounds and nothing else.

756 2018-10-31 22:09:54 Billionaires shouldn't exist and oil corporations should have all their assets seized. Health care is a human right and only big government can mitigate the horrors of catastrophic global climate change.

770 2018-10-31 22:06:45 Prove it
You post something instead of just spouting opinion

Oil has brought in a total of 400bn since 60s, that's 8bn a year on average, last year it was only £1.2bn and quite a bit of that was from field in what would be technically English waters.
771 2018-10-31 22:06:14 You need an oil change come through I’m bored
772 2018-10-31 22:06:14 I’ve been told ... the largest cost / input derives from price of ... oil. All the plastic bins/ containers for retail customers.... plus moving truck fleet.

834 2018-10-31 21:58:51 Which also supports the argument that we need to stop destabilizing other governments for political reasons and foster better relationships by other means. It’s always about oil, or preventing socialism from taking root, etc. something has to give

855 2018-10-31 21:55:23 What a game, perfect result considering the occasion the @dcfcofficial @morriskid team and all concerned epic game! #ThankYou #Emotional #Proud #SuperFrank #Legend #MyHero #CFCFamily #UpTheChels #KTBFFH 
856 2018-10-31 21:55:11 I hear you! I put a few drops of tea tree oil in my mascara tube because I am creeped out at the thought of them on my eyelashes
857 2018-10-31 21:55:06 @LACMA help ,I got termite spray on three of my oil paintings. How can I remove it?
858 2018-10-31 21:54:41 I came home with a sinus headache and Mark made me a neti pot, put peppermint oil in the diffuser, and massaged the knots out of my neck & shoulders. I'm one lucky duck. 
859 2018-10-31 21:54:39 Saudi Arabia is like a spoiled child and bully rolled n to one. Clearly executing  a journalist and then a week later executing a domestic worker for nothing makes them a country we should sanction severely... Oh that's right ot's the oil.
860 2018-10-31 21:54:36 Here in Colorado, they make it sound like thousands of jobs will be destroyed if the proposal passes. It's difficult to tell if the ads are even sponsored by Big Oil.
861 2018-10-31 21:54:24 わーい、デートだ(遠い目
862 2018-10-31 21:53:54 Have a good night my sister. Don't let us & the Turkanas demand that oil resources be shared on the basis of where it is rigged. Tuko na reserves remember! Natukae na undugu........
863 2018-10-31 21:53:39 頭のかぼちゃ、どうにかならないんですか！？
864 2018-10-31 21:53:26 Glad to hear that. You need our Breathe Blend for the oil burner
865 2018-10-31 21:53:16 Same.  Nasty ingredients!!  NGREDIENTS: CATALINA LOW CARB FLOUR BLEND (PEA PROTEIN, POTATO FIBER, CORN FIBER, CHICORY FIBER, ACACIA FIBER, GUAR GUM, TURMERIC), TAPIOCA, SUNFLOWER OIL, COCOA, BAKING POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORS, SEA SALT, CALCIUM CARBONATE, VITAMIN E, MONK FRUIT
866 2018-10-31 21:53:16 Because that's world that buys the most oil. Big oil funds the activists, politicians and media that pushes people to the right. Left will say "We need to save ourselves go green and share" oil companies don't want that, they want "We need to be rich now! Screw everyone else!"
867 2018-10-31 21:53:00 I used linseed oil as a young artist, took fooking ages (weeks) for my oils to 'dry' so they wouldn't smear. Acrylic was the way forward.

Might not work on a pan though.
868 2018-10-31 21:52:48 how much oil are you putting in your hair??
869 2018-10-31 21:51:57 *I make Mr. Happy behave before getting dressed again, gathering all the animals together.* Are we walking? I’m filling some oil lanterns. Old-school seems more appropriate.
870 2018-10-31 21:51:55 Let us begin to brace as the  cycle starts, #NLC strike loading... The next will be the #ASUU then #NUPENG and oil marketers with ultimatum to Governemt  to fix roads and pay them subsidy.  Fuel scarcity as pricea skyrocet for the season. Then by 2nd week of January 2019...
871 2018-10-31 21:51:50 Already voted yes because big oil is one of our biggest enemies. Our earth and our people need less of your power, not more.
872 2018-10-31 21:51:08 fuel oil vs coal competition in power gen is a big unstudied variable in environmental impact of sulphur cap. But sulphur being chased out of power gen market as well- see great bloomberg piece on India’s crackdown on petcoke
873 2018-10-31 21:50:49 @DSmithShow chimichurri is so easy to make. Fresh parsley, olive oil, garlic, chili flakes. Throw into a blender with salt & pepper. Blend. Voila.
874 2018-10-31 21:50:42 I think i have came to conclusion that i am indeed black as shit , lotion no longer workers, baby oil makes me shiny as hell . Smh Vaseline it is 
875 2018-10-31 21:50:40 Stop drinking the snake oil ya fool.
876 2018-10-31 21:50:11 If I somehow find it in myself to live with my Unshowered self for just another night I can put some coconut oil in my hair and wash it out tomorrow. Do it Ceren. Do it.
877 2018-10-31 21:49:58 oil looks so drinkable
878 2018-10-31 21:49:44 I was driving around for 6 months with expired registration and insurance cards. I didn’t change my oil in 8 months. I have an oil leak. My back windshield wiper is broken. My state inspection expired 6 months ago. I had no idea any of this was happening. I need baba
879 2018-10-31 21:49:43 @MeridianFoods hey guys. A few friends and I have noticed a different taste and texture on our most recent tubs of crunchy peanut butter, richer, and almost pre mixed with the oil. Have you changed the recipe? Not a complaint as I quite like the new taste.
880 2018-10-31 21:49:37 Ding Ding Ding
881 2018-10-31 21:49:09 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
882 2018-10-31 21:49:06 And that deficit of N4tr could possibly widen if for whatever reason oil prices or oil production falls and by extension expected oil revenue. Our budget is in a very vulnerable and precarious situation.
883 2018-10-31 21:48:33 there's a dude here in town that has a line of cbd oil. it's called Doyle's oil. if I was on fb I could send a link.
884 2018-10-31 21:48:09 Tonight's episode of #IrelandsDeepAtlantic was terrific! So great to learn about all the sea life just off our shores. Not so great to learn about the impact of seismic testing by the oil industry on whales and dolphins. @Dept_CCAE #keepitintheground
885 2018-10-31 21:48:05 Only reason i have HBO is GOT.  They aren’t going to kill the golden goose.  Thought a GOT prequel is in the works.
886 2018-10-31 21:48:03 Yes it was. Sold $10.5bill of oil assets.
887 2018-10-31 21:48:02 See oil made kelewele....so so sickness
888 2018-10-31 21:47:40 favorite hobby: panicking about peak oil
889 2018-10-31 21:47:29 Fish,fish,fish again,onion,oil,salt,pepper
890 2018-10-31 21:47:20 Where cannot find, jobs are coming back everywhere, Wages are finally starting back up, we are restoring our national defense. Lower taxes, less energy dependence on mideast oil, respect again around the world. Compare America to Venezuela for they went Socialist recently.
891 2018-10-31 21:47:00 Interestingly, troops on US soil are prohibited from doing anything other than repairing vehicles and providing supplies. 15,000 troops, that's a lot of oil changes.
892 2018-10-31 21:46:56 getting my oil changed and a brake light replaced and the guy saw my longboard in my trunk and asked to ride it around the parking lot with me. what a guy.
893 2018-10-31 21:46:47 Don’t nobody try harder to get you to get some more shit done than a mf doin your oil change!
894 2018-10-31 21:46:39 Ur power as emperor end in ofe groundnut oil land. Rubbish lifeless man.
895 2018-10-31 21:46:37 Copper down, oil down, treasuries prices down (and therefore yields up), stocks... up?
896 2018-10-31 21:46:29 I wonder how many ppl showed up to see this snake oil charlatan.
897 2018-10-31 21:46:18 Getting this oil change. Productivity
898 2018-10-31 21:46:14 Are you sure? Because if I put oil, water, and sand in a bottle and shake it (chaos) each item will sort itself based on density (order) and no intelligent influence will have been involved.

900 2018-10-31 21:45:34 Fact n oil
901 2018-10-31 21:45:29 THERE WAS ALREADY AN OIL LEAK FROM the Pipeline that they Promised would not leak, how many Gallons was it before they could get it stopped, was it 1000's ?
902 2018-10-31 21:45:19 $110 for an oil change #BMW #shouldvegotaprius
903 2018-10-31 21:45:14 Harper's big $13B tax cut = $12B for big corporations and the very wealthy, $1B for all the people and small businesses it was trumpeted as helping. You lot were even worse than what we have now and you don't seem to have learned a thing about improving life for most Canadians.
904 2018-10-31 21:45:06 [I smirked, tongue in cheek and huffed a breathy giggle. Kissing you once more before I stood up. 

I ventured to my bag and the few boxes I’d carried in that sat over at the table and began to get dressed again. Applying Frankincense oil as if it were perfume, then pulling on >
905 2018-10-31 21:45:03 おはようございます
朝は寒いですね！
ジャケットを羽織らないと寒いくらい
昨日の休みでリフレッシュしたので今日も頑張ろうと笑

土曜日は休日だし車のoil交換に行こうかなぁ。
それと昨日の夜からエンジン警告灯がついたしなぁ
メンテ行きます。
今日も怪我や事故には気をつけていこうね
906 2018-10-31 21:45:00 Ooh yay for vinegar! I'm not sure! Do you add a drop or two of essential oil into the mix? That can help leave a nice smell behind 
907 2018-10-31 21:44:57 #113 Current Account maintenance fee? @StanbicIBTC please,what are you maintening? Did you put engine oil in the account?
908 2018-10-31 21:44:49 I get off early for the 1st time in weeks (1530) and now it’s been an hour and ten mins for Firestone to rotate my tires and oil change.. I had an appointment too #wtfman
909 2018-10-31 21:44:47 風呂でアイル歌ってたら唐突に「風呂上がりWeekend」が脳裏を過ったけどそもそも今日は花の金曜じゃないって話
910 2018-10-31 21:44:45 Interestingly, the troops on US soil are prohibited from doing anything other than repairing vehicles and providing supplies. 15,000 troops, that's a lot of oil changes.
911 2018-10-31 21:44:37 Can we also note the motor oil in an ornate frame on the floor...after of course the wall art
912 2018-10-31 21:44:35 White House just sent out a memo from President Trump declaring there is a "sufficient supply" of world oil to compensate for tough sanctions on Iran set to go into effect in a few days
913 2018-10-31 21:44:32 "The grooviest and whitest things in the world cannot be ingested or even cuddled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
914 2018-10-31 21:44:25 I think opec should stabilize the price of oil atleast for a reasonable period of time for some countries economy to be recovered
915 2018-10-31 21:44:12 @timandsid Time for a coaching change in Oil country! He had loads of talent in San Jose with the same result, zilch.
916 2018-10-31 21:44:05 予定していたOIL SABADINESはとっとと申し込み。さすがに今度の土日までには届かないね。
917 2018-10-31 21:43:52 America has; invaded multiple nations to steal OIL, interfered in elections, financed revolutions, overthrew governments, installed dictators, supported oppressive regimes & murdered civilians! Who will sanction America? #Chile #Nicaragua #ElSalvador #Panama #Columbia #Venezuela
918 2018-10-31 21:43:51 I wanna ask you one question Why terrorist organizations always serve for US interests Like oil fields like Omar oil fields in syria and mosul in iraq After they defeated only thing remains is proxies who serve to US interests I dont want to explain creating AQ against communism.
919 2018-10-31 21:43:44 Lots of orange juice and take oregano oil in capsules
920 2018-10-31 21:43:38 That is a pretty cool picture.
921 2018-10-31 21:43:24 I would love Lord Sugar to try and sell me an oil tanker, just so I could tell him to fuck off. #TheApprentice
922 2018-10-31 21:43:14 that baby oil and lotion combination 
923 2018-10-31 21:43:09 The squeaky wheel gets the oil!! 
924 2018-10-31 21:43:00 @ChelseaFC @dcfcofficial @morriskid What a Game what a place to be tonight we was blessed  Sir Frank put a team out that gave us a wonderful night at the bridge. My hero Super Super Frankie Lampard. Worth the 6k miles flight bck #DXB perfect result for all 3-2  #CFCFamily 
925 2018-10-31 21:42:54 How do you go 37,000 miles with out an oil change.
926 2018-10-31 21:42:44 
In 2019 abi 2023. 
Don't worry local oil catches fire faster n stay so. But all this Processed oil will just off with small touch. Thank u but this fire is unquenchable.
927 2018-10-31 21:42:43 Just gotta refinance my tires to pay for the oil for my wife and kids!
928 2018-10-31 21:42:32 Very nice. Our youngest wants to go back because 'the stuff you buy here catches my throat'.

Aye, no bother Madi, just a couple of grand to grab some nice olive oil.
929 2018-10-31 21:42:14 True life: I always bring the baby oil
930 2018-10-31 21:42:01 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
931 2018-10-31 21:41:54 State of nature means you pump and refine your own oil:  I’d be all in.
932 2018-10-31 21:41:52 Quoi Hulot? Le type qui est a l'origine de la taxation du gaz oil?
933 2018-10-31 21:41:48 You are right. I used Mobil oil. You can ask for the price tomorrow. The highest oil in Nigeria
934 2018-10-31 21:41:46 NDs and Liberals bought a pipeline to support investor confidence. If there is a lack of investor confidence now, it is because everyone knows that oil sands oil won't be produced at expected levels. That's because of climate change, not the NDP.
935 2018-10-31 21:41:37 Ah. You do not understand the difference between high pressure hydraulic fracturing of shale as opposed to conventional well stimulation? That explains everything. The oil industry celebrated its 20 anniversary of using fracking into shale... couple of weeks back it was.... :)
936 2018-10-31 21:41:07 Ok so looking at the HMRC numbers for UK oil and gas generated tax receipts in 2015 ( negative) 2016/7/6 ( negative) 2017/18 ( 1.1 billion) I cannot see how you would becoming vastly richer by keeping oil and gas revenue given Scotland's current level of expenditure.
937 2018-10-31 21:41:03 is now coming from our own oil wells and new drilling sites. 

If you want to discuss how over supply of oil on the global market influences the petrodollar and prices of oil by the barrel then fine...None of that has to do with supporting Israel other than another ally in the ME
938 2018-10-31 21:41:00 Anyone want to buy an oil tanker? @Lord_Sugar #TheApprentice
939 2018-10-31 21:40:46 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
940 2018-10-31 21:40:46 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
941 2018-10-31 21:40:34 "oh no, my roomba knocked over my essential oil diffuser onto a library book" -- a real and upsetting thing i said today
942 2018-10-31 21:40:32 beard oil
943 2018-10-31 21:40:30 It's oil
944 2018-10-31 21:40:26 …ぐぅ
945 2018-10-31 21:40:23 @PeoplesMomentum So I want to bring you into a hard nasty reality. Where does all the gas and oil in the UK come from? Who controls the international financial system so you can go to the cash till? Secret - it's not you.
946 2018-10-31 21:40:09 オススメデッキください #lov3 #lovfan
947 2018-10-31 21:40:05 #MagnesiumOil is a bit of a misnomer. Our product is not an oil at all. Magnesium oil contains just purified water, magnesium chloride from the #DeadSea, and naturally occurring trace minerals. The high salinity of the product is what gives it a slightly oily feel.
948 2018-10-31 21:40:03 I reckon that is Uncle Stephen under cover.
949 2018-10-31 21:39:52 There are so many mossback preachers in America that you can find “snake oil” on any corner and a man with a Bible selling it.Problem is most folks don’t know the difference and never been in a Holy Ghost filled meeting.Write a self help book about Jesus,God is laughing at you!!
950 2018-10-31 21:39:44 on each occasion Mr. Drumpf issues alternative facts, a sad wolf cries for mama #resist
951 2018-10-31 21:39:43 Overlay crude px on that chart and we see oil stocks barely rallied as crude went from 50-> 75 .
952 2018-10-31 21:39:42 I saw Lord Sugga  yesterday buying Oil tankers the lying pubic bearded Twat  #TheApprentice
953 2018-10-31 21:39:23 I repeat, oil
954 2018-10-31 21:39:17 Did you know that last year America alone used 50 million water bottles , and only recycled 23%. This demand of water uses more than 17 million barrels of oil a year, or enough to power 1.3 million cars. Buy a water filter, it’s WAY cheaper. #ditch #water #bottles #earth
955 2018-10-31 21:39:10 كل الشكر لك اخوي زياد ونتعلم منك طال عمرك
956 2018-10-31 21:39:05 Talk of maintenance, I don't compromise!! I use Total quartz 9000, every 4months, for my ride. That's Total's highest oil grade. Selling for N13,300 4litres + 1ltr for N3600
957 2018-10-31 21:39:02 Bummer, ok, not really. I like this prediction going forward.
""I do see a nice rebound for crude oil as we get into the very end of  the year, and the heart of the Northern Hemisphere winter of about  $75-plus for crude WTI," Kilduff said."
958 2018-10-31 21:38:54 remember when you were a kid and you discovered oil and water separate
959 2018-10-31 21:38:50 Lol...
The shrink in import is most likely due to increased production. However the global outlook for oil in the near future is a supply crunch. Make we dey watch sha hopefully there won't be recession any time soon @UmarAOmar
960 2018-10-31 21:38:28 Beyond the current rate of 4.9%? I'm sure it will. Do I fear that? No. We are a peaceful country. We don't impose on others with our version of democracy where the only principle is oil and wealth.

963 2018-10-31 21:38:22 Oil tankers....is that Alan Sugar using cockney rhyming slang again? 
#TheApprentice2018 #TheApprentice
964 2018-10-31 21:38:18 Where did oil tankers come from? Is lord sugar planning on getting into the oil market #TheApprentice
965 2018-10-31 21:38:16 Sir Alan. I really don't think you could flog oil tankers. Tankers are very complex and specific things. You're an idiot who seemingly doesn't know what hip hop is #TheApprentice
966 2018-10-31 21:38:13 #Tesla never adverises. They are busy building and delivering. The sales happen because the product is SO good not by putting this lame ad on radio, tv or the web. Wake up #oil and #gas companies and traditional automakers
967 2018-10-31 21:38:12 When I see consultant companies (bigger ones) at confs they seem more interested in looking for talents to recruit then in search for customers. Just like most big non-consulting firms. Third kind is tool vendors. They are the ones peddle goods or snake oil.
968 2018-10-31 21:38:06 I want to see Alan Sugar trying to flog oil tankers. We all need one, right? #TheApprentice
969 2018-10-31 21:38:01 Russia is the biggest single oil producer in the world.
970 2018-10-31 21:37:55 Remember..candy corn is made with corn oil..so it's a veggie in disguise... Happy Halloween..
971 2018-10-31 21:37:44 Can’t wait for @Lord_Sugar to flog oil tankers. #TheApprentice
972 2018-10-31 21:37:40 Better then when I went as Carrie one year and someone took a picture of me nest to a bonfire...
973 2018-10-31 21:37:36 No, you don't get to move the goal post.  
You said that our caring was "fake", because of "access to oil" … Our "access to oil" comes mostly from imported oil from Canada. Our access to oil in the Middle East comes mostly form an ally already Saudi Arabia. Our "access to oil"
974 2018-10-31 21:37:31 Try replacing "climate scientists" by "lying oil billionaires" and "government grants" by "our hard-earned money", and it'll make more sense.
975 2018-10-31 21:37:31 They best wake up from being "woke".

The North remembers.
976 2018-10-31 21:37:28 Congi goes only after sucking our the life of financial health of this nation.
This time they amputated PSU banks and Oil Marketing companies.
People r addicted to Congi mantra push inflation and growth will follow.
But what follows is unemployment and slackness
977 2018-10-31 21:37:28 I make a wonderful dinner for Thanksgiving Christmas and spend time with family. I'm don't buy into corporate holidays where they guilt u into buying an insane amount of crap. For my BDay I ask hubby to get my oil changed cuz he already gives me everything I want rest of the yr.
978 2018-10-31 21:37:26 I wear white too and I too had 'skin in the game'  I don't want to see young people sent to fight wars for the rich, for oil, for corporations profits, who return home maimed, scarred or worse. 
Lest we forget? @JohnnyMercerUK 
Like your Tory scm forget our homeless veterans?
979 2018-10-31 21:37:23 Libertarian: When a neigbour's cows develop hoof-and-mouth disease nobody can force him to reveal that it's happened. Your cows show early symptoms so you quickly sell them to a slaughterhouse so that they enter the food supply.
980 2018-10-31 21:37:21 Have you eaten Àkàrà ke'gbe of Ọ̀yọ́.. The one they use palm oil to fry yen..
981 2018-10-31 21:37:19 Hahahahahah told you jerry the comment show your not likes.. We aimt paying for your gas/oil buddy.. Get outta California to to Florida and retire. I aint know we had a governor where you been goofing off with MIKE Feuer and eric.. The Three Stooges
982 2018-10-31 21:37:15 Take some fish oil pills
983 2018-10-31 21:37:11 Sorry but both these two are in the service of the oil companies, they are just pretending. What we need to do is to start The Hippies Revival Party, make love not wars and completely outlaw all forms of corporate lobbying, for starters.
984 2018-10-31 21:37:05 Don't they have a GOT prequel series coming?
985 2018-10-31 21:37:00 My hair smells like the coconut oil I used
986 2018-10-31 21:36:57 Lol joke of the year. Malema and ethics is like oil and water.
987 2018-10-31 21:36:35 @C_Mulroney @fordnation @GregRickford In the last month my fuel oil heating supplier (Ultramar Rural Ottawa area) has INCREASED their price 7c/ltr from 1.0799c.ltr. Cap & trade price reductions need to be mandated in Ontario province-wide to be passed on to end customers.
988 2018-10-31 21:36:30 Agreed-  Lotus Cheek was below average. Ponderous ..like an oil tanker when he had to turn. Lost possession easily and little effort to get it back .. could be riding the pine on Premier League days

990 2018-10-31 21:36:12 has she gotten her oil changed?
991 2018-10-31 21:36:02 Difference is big clubs don’t slide into the wilderness. City would be screwed without the oil money. Be straight back to between 10th and 16th every season. I.E. Your true level
992 2018-10-31 21:36:00 I really enjoy fancy edible stuff. Have been offered a small bottle of truffle flavoured olive oil, loved it. Sounds expensive, but it's not.
993 2018-10-31 21:35:56 I worked in oil in Commiefornia and I’m sure it’s leased to dog parks and soccer fields, but oilfield? They hate oil out there that’s why I left !!!

997 2018-10-31 21:35:27 When I was about 10, I learned about finite resources like oil & coal, and that these would run out. This was an ordinary UK state school education.

1018 2018-10-31 21:33:04 Can’t wait to go back to Harlem in a few weeks. Back to my quiet apartment, my perfect bed, the thermostat at a comfortable temp and not 300 degrees; away from the smell of cooking oil and my baby nephew who is actually a puppy.

1027 2018-10-31 21:31:55 @SpeakerRyan is not one of my favorite people but given the choice between him and @realDonaldTrump Ryan is the more knowledgeable on the Constitution...or anything else for that matter. Trump is just a slick ass snake oil salesman.
1028 2018-10-31 21:31:43 Rising oil prices have been noted with adverse effect on economies, affecting current account deficits of countries.
The actual reason behind revising petroleum prices in Pakistan. 
Recent oil prices hike is due to Saudi retaliation to western threats over Khashoggi murder.

1053 2018-10-31 21:28:07 We don’t have ‘vast oil and gas’ resources. We have vast fishing waters with little finishing industry. Yes they make their home here 4 tax rate bcuz w/are competitive that way (we have no manufacturing industry). We are short for high skilled work too.

1108 2018-10-31 21:20:05 Thats comforting that we both agree on the necessity of a gas tax.  The fact is, even if its repealed, the market has already proven it can bear the cost, and station owners and oil companies will just come up with some 'winter blend' excuse to keep prices the same.

Even for this extreme example, a large power plant is much more efficient than an ICE vehicle at converting that energy into useful work.

1147 2018-10-31 21:16:03 In Texas, there a LOT of old families invested in OIL and CATTLE. It's always about the money. Ted works for those people because they are contributors. However, a lot of democrats have been moving there steadily over the years and things just might change now.
1148 2018-10-31 21:15:58 Yes. 
It's a must, esp. if I forget to add butter or oil when boiling rice or in the rice cooker. Hard, dry, crusty rice is the worst.

1151 2018-10-31 21:15:24 @ninetonoon Christoph Frei, Sec Gen of World Energy Council on Oil industry's response was predictably disappointing. Waffling on about smart tech & transitioning. Mate you've had decades for that. Halting #Abrupt#ClimateChange thru smart-tech consumerism is too little too late

1158 2018-10-31 21:14:13 Answer is mullahs don't buy #medicine to save money for #Assad and #houthi, then blame #sanctions for shortage. Import of soybeans on the other hand is profitable and #IRGC owned companies consume the soybeans to produce soybean oil and other byproducts at a great profit
1159 2018-10-31 21:14:05 I hated Fanta Orange for the longest time because my granny mixed castor oil in it and she told me to drink it very fast

1168 2018-10-31 21:12:41 Sometimes I wonder that we give too much weight on macro projections specially crude oil ,after so called experts suggesting it to cross usd 100 this month itself the drop is 10%+
1169 2018-10-31 21:12:26 Nonsense. MBS is the new old Saudi leader, not so different from the previous ones, allied with the US because he has oil, won't threaten Israel, and all three are aligned against Iran.

1171 2018-10-31 21:12:20 yesss, i definitely do. i did use avocado oil the other day though
1172 2018-10-31 21:12:11 I like Wille. The other two I would rather swim in a pot of boiling oil than watch.
1173 2018-10-31 21:11:52 There will be NO Market or very less demand for Oil & Gas in the coming days ahead as Oil & Gas demand in the World will Fall heavily due to Electric Mobility, Nuclear Energy etc. Even ATF demand will fall due to Electric Planes being Built by Int'l Firms..

1177 2018-10-31 21:11:10 If by "you" you mean "oil companies," then absolutely.
There are all sorts of oil companies with the capital and ability to build synth businesses out of AB's oil sands. Anyone who cries cuz they can't afford it can go dig a hole somewhere else.
1178 2018-10-31 21:10:57 Currently shovelling horse manure from the stables of the border patrol horses and doing oil and tire changes. #WasteOfResources
1179 2018-10-31 21:10:44 Does this have anything to do with the millions you take from private school owner and oil billionaire Tim Dunn?  He is flooding Texas with dirty money and buying votes to gut public education.  You are a thief and a liar who steals from childrens’ futures!
1180 2018-10-31 21:10:42 What are you talking about? The entire North Sea was fracked, as is most conventional oil and gas these days. There's been fracking in Scottish waters for over 40 years.

1185 2018-10-31 21:10:14 I’m so sick of expending my time beyond what I want. I already work 1 hours a day! I want to scream! Like we don’t have two other days in the week! Burning the midnight oil is not needed 
1186 2018-10-31 21:10:12 RT @LivingSafely: Ritz Original Crackers this November? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.

1191 2018-10-31 21:09:53 Mick needs his CBD oil :)
1192 2018-10-31 21:09:53 Treated myself to a new bath oil today and its peach/mango/matcha tea flavor and it smells so good!!
1193 2018-10-31 21:09:48 Oil collapsed but people on Vancouver Island and mainland didn’t notice except for cheap gas. With low GDP. Get over it
1194 2018-10-31 21:09:26 Guess you think China's economy is bad because they're more capitalist than America's.  Norway's boutique economy without its North Sea oil fields would be like Sweden's.
1195 2018-10-31 21:09:23 Case reviews just now.  Boss saw me LOL... 
1196 2018-10-31 21:09:22 Yep! Or olive oil when I’m trying to be good.
1197 2018-10-31 21:09:20 Try Charolette's Web CBD oil. Worked for me!
1198 2018-10-31 21:09:14 I took my car to get an oil change today. Without my dad telling me it’s time. I think I’m officially an adult
1199 2018-10-31 21:09:14 Razor ruddock literally gets naked for sky 1 to be an oil painting on a league of their own. He probably claims it’s a laugh, but he needs the money to pay back Wonga or whoever the payday loan is at the time. I’d rather have broken legs.
1200 2018-10-31 21:09:10 Why wouldn’t oil & gas fit that description?
1201 2018-10-31 21:09:09 See crude oil!!!!! So deep !!!!!!

1204 2018-10-31 21:08:49 Well come get this castor oil so he can come & we can trade kids 
1205 2018-10-31 21:08:48 And drug dealing more important that the rise of the far right? I would say both are abhorrent. Snake oil salesman trick to move the topic. But you forget l dislike all arrogant political figures whatever the side. So dragging up Lab or Libs doesn't arse me.
1206 2018-10-31 21:08:41 Killing & starving millions of Yemenis for their oil. In essence, Saudi Arabia is doing the same thing to Yemen, as the Israelis are doing in Palestine. The result of Zionism's lust for power and land.
1207 2018-10-31 21:08:39 It was 2.5% in June July 2016 under Obama. Up and down up and down. Touched around 4 in June this year. It’s down again. Meanwhile people here doing ok. GDP goes up and down. It was tanking when Trudeau took over from Stephen hypocrite government. Oil collapsed.
1208 2018-10-31 21:08:27 Toothpaste and baby oil removes hideous mistake... we should send a truckload of each to the Whitehouse
1209 2018-10-31 21:08:12 Really? Now just why would that be? Has Trump created too many jobs? Has Trump wiped away too many worthless onerous regulations? Has Trump decreased our dependence on foreign oil? Has Trump kept too many of his campaign promises? I would like to know why so many women switch?
1210 2018-10-31 21:08:11 On another note I need to find some. CBD oil here in El Paso. My meds aren't working lately!
1211 2018-10-31 21:07:37 Well I’m not sure David. I’m no scientist, but I know that if giant oil companies are spending 30+ million here in Washington to defeat a bill that they MUST have our best interest at heart.
1212 2018-10-31 21:07:19 Same here.
1213 2018-10-31 21:07:17 LOL!!!!!!!!!!!
1214 2018-10-31 21:07:16 I'm willing to bet money that it doesn't end up in 15,000 troops.   This is just one more example of how full of sh*t @realDonaldTrump is.  Focus on getting to the polls on Tuesday, folks.  Ignore the snake oil salesman.
1215 2018-10-31 21:06:53 RUSSIA’S GOVT, OIL COS. REACH DEAL ON FREEZING FUEL PRICES
1216 2018-10-31 21:06:40 Norway also possesses a state run petroleum industry which produces more oil per capita than Saudi Arabia. Another fact that proponents of ‘redistribution’ conveniently leave out.
1217 2018-10-31 21:06:38 Baby oil, coconut oil or even Vaseline if you don't have anything else
1218 2018-10-31 21:06:30 Depends how they're cooked. Boiling them brings out the sulphuric smell and bitterness. Roasting them with just a bit of olive oil is awesome.

1221 2018-10-31 21:06:16 We acquire about 80% of our oil from overseas. Produced into gas and goes in our vehicles with a tax added on.

Who pays for the oil that is bought overseas???
1222 2018-10-31 21:05:37 Thank you!  Thank you!  My heart does break knowing our President is paying off Stephan Chancellor, an oil executive for a $1M contribution by loosening gaming regulations!

1226 2018-10-31 21:05:20 WHALES before destructive, short-sighted, unsustainable big oil.
1227 2018-10-31 21:05:20 I"m voting No.  I'd rather the tax we're already paying continue to go to repairing roads and not absorbed by oil companies and station owners who will never lower the price even if the tax is repealed.
1228 2018-10-31 21:05:19 Gave my baby an oil change 
1229 2018-10-31 21:05:16 I’m currently trying Clary Sage oil and candles. It supposed to help.. I have everything crossed!
1230 2018-10-31 21:05:11 As we must learn to read labels knowing the harm of gmo's, rapeseed oil, soy, "natural seasonings" sodium nitaite, anti caking agents etc.  We must look beyond the labels of a political party and see how that person has been living and will likely continue.  Get beyond cartoons.

1232 2018-10-31 21:04:46 Most people don't know how to cook them to make them actually taste good. A lot of us grew up with them just boiled which is awful. Roasted with olive oil and seasonings makes them delicious!
1233 2018-10-31 21:04:45 When you position is untenable, attack on non-core issues and ramp up misdirection. Snake oil salesmen lead BidCo.
1234 2018-10-31 21:04:35 No you also said about cutting tax
1235 2018-10-31 21:04:22 You wana know what really bothers me....the British government doesn't give a toss about the suffering in the Yemen.
If they did, the RAF wouldn't be over there helping the Saudis bomb Yemen's  infrastructure.
We wouldn't be selling arms to these murdering oil rich princes....Oh
1236 2018-10-31 21:04:21 I got to talk to my dad today it was so nice to hear and see him. But can you all do me a favour keep him in your prayers the sea is very rough and we all know what can happen to oil rigs.

1240 2018-10-31 21:03:19 Likely so. Thing with the products offered by AutoZone is most of it is immediate demand driven. People will go straight there to purchase the product when they need it — oil, washer fluid, spark plugs, wiper blades, etc.
1241 2018-10-31 21:03:19 Mine is koko yam and palm oil

1245 2018-10-31 21:03:09 @Audi my A4 is consuming excessive oil, 4.6 liters per 1000 miles, which is a know issue by Audi and you won't take care of the problem!!  Thanks for sticking me with a $5000 bill.  I will NEVER by another Audi. Worst mistake of my life!
1246 2018-10-31 21:03:01 I know, it's crazy.
1247 2018-10-31 21:02:26 I don't want to make a difference I want to burn tires in my backyard end dump used motor oil in rivers.

1253 2018-10-31 21:01:32 Snopes claimed something about Obama "False".  This was like 2009.  I read it 3 times until I figured out, they basically claimed it false on a technicality.  It was "fucking" TRUE in actuality.

Sell your snake oil somewhere else.  Your rant was garbage.
1254 2018-10-31 21:01:31 Put them in a geologically stable underground site.   Not nearly as bad as oil.  

Wind and solar are high-maintenance and one German February away from blackouts.
1255 2018-10-31 21:01:26 Let me keep my oil nearby just incase
1256 2018-10-31 21:01:20 That’s why I said they want to tone...
Personally I do not see the need to. But the craze for “I want my skin to shine” is killing a lot of people these days. Walk into a store and there’s a whole section of one toning cream, serum and oil. It’s sad really.
1257 2018-10-31 21:01:09 David: did you hit a bird?

1278 2018-10-31 20:59:08 Although I have yet to try CBD oil (don’t have a credit card to order it) I am a big believer in it. I’ve seen it do a lot of good for people without all the nasty side affects that something like a narcotic pain reliever or anxiety medication would have. People are ignorant.

1282 2018-10-31 20:57:58 Why would Scotland get hugely increased revenues ? Oil price is 75 dollars a barrel which is better than the 45 dollars it was hovering at not long ago ? Please support your statement ?

1286 2018-10-31 20:57:07 The only way American oil producers could stay in the oil business is when oil prices with up from $40 a Barrel to $70 a barrel. Price increases we see now are mostly the result of unrest in major producing countries like Venezuela, and the president's renewed sanctions on Iran.
1287 2018-10-31 20:57:05 Its such a confidence killer my face was RIDDLED with blackheads but I don't think I've gotten a new one since I started, it really just saps out all the oil in your face

1369 2018-10-31 20:47:14 The US carries a USD 600 bn trade deficit per year or USD 50 bn per month. If worldwide central banks have to spend net more than 50 bn for oil imports ( instead of hoarding), interest rates will move up sharply. We are close to this tipping point.

1459 2018-10-31 20:36:09 The day NS was disqualified crude oil was 48$ a barrel and today its 76$. Last week it was 84. As we import oil we can’t keep prices low because you will be making a loss if you don’t increase accordingly.

1461 2018-10-31 20:36:04 Voted no. Research shows this is an open ended tax with no plan and it could be decades before the people see any benifits. Big oil will get their money out of us one way or the other.

1531 2018-10-31 20:27:43 David Cameron himself gives you a "reference point" in the above video.
Oil revenues have been historically demographically shared within the UK, which means e.g. example year 2010-2011, Scotland got £0.9bn and rUK got £11Bn share of direct revenues.

1556 2018-10-31 20:24:45 Omnishambles does not have an electoral mandate for Oil and Gas Bill. It is of such huge importance concerning our future prosperity and way of life we are entitled to have a say. Govt is governing in pursuit of ideology, not on behalf of people.
1557 2018-10-31 20:24:42 Today I have eaten  soup,  fries, oil, ice cream, and oil ice cream. what a day.

1560 2018-10-31 20:24:39 I came to get an oil change today. There is one guy working. He has a serious 1992 mullet. His co-worker is sleeping in his car in the parking lot. And has been for 3 hours. So. It’s just me and Billy Ray.
1561 2018-10-31 20:24:23 Same with crude oil at 67 today
1562 2018-10-31 20:24:22 We have vast oil & gas resources, rich fishing waters, all of it given away at the expense of the Irish taxp's. FDR make their home here for the tax rate, the talent is good but needs 2b better, still 2 many companies sourcing outside Ireland for skilled workers.
1563 2018-10-31 20:24:06 Yeah I corrected myself in a separate thread, I mean any organic combustion. Natural gas might as well be oil. Carbs in CO2 and H2O out. It is what it is.
1564 2018-10-31 20:24:05 Is it oil or more the worry of Fed becoming restrictive next year?
1565 2018-10-31 20:23:58 Why the guy no run

1569 2018-10-31 20:23:35 I'm not saying not to vote. Do your conscience. But "we're slightly better than the GOP" isn't an effective electoral strategy. Weak leadership chose not to take a party-wide stance against oil money and chose not to rally around big policy issues. If they lose, it's not voters.
1570 2018-10-31 20:23:02 Haha my uni house has an oil tank and people are throwing fireworks up the alley but here I go off to Nando’s hoping the house will still be here when I come back xx lol love Belfast lovely people xx

1578 2018-10-31 20:21:28 First thing that would ACTUALLY address climate change? That's easy: ban the production and sale of oil. Anything else is just posturing.

1580 2018-10-31 20:21:16 Everyone who drives, takes to the air, or swans off on a boat trip, are inadvertently propping up these barbarian regimes. Without their vast oil reserves, they remain barbarian & petty minded Islamists, rocking the status quo of democracy. With Islam and their awful existence.
1581 2018-10-31 20:21:06 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

1587 2018-10-31 20:20:09 It's pretty grim, but kind of predictable, how many people seem to like my The Long Dark tweets but when I click through to their profile are weird rightwing nutjobs. I mean the last one had an oil painting-style Trump and Ivanka as their profile picture.

1685 2018-10-31 20:07:41 Isn't it obvious?  Clearly IHS is short $TSLA and paid by big oil to put out bad data and muddy the waters.  There's no way an SEC sanctioned former Chairman who's still under an active DOJ investigation would consider massaging the numbers to support a capital raise.
1686 2018-10-31 20:07:39 The rise before the fall from the #tariffs and high #gas #oil #oilandgas #IranSanctions hit in #November
1687 2018-10-31 20:07:37 Cuz nothing says conservative like giving our country away to the Globalists. Decimating oil and industry with another tax. Blocking pipelines to appease special interests. Organizing and funding an Islamic takeover of our country. On and On. #WakeUpCanada
1688 2018-10-31 20:07:31 #Rip #Gen_Alkali such a nation without regards for human rights. No difference between oil and blood @PDPNYF @OlayinkaLere @benmurraybruce
1689 2018-10-31 20:07:27 It’s like, latex on acrylic on oil on plaster. Sooooo many layers!
1690 2018-10-31 20:07:19 Heating oil looks a bit toppy here
1691 2018-10-31 20:07:13 They have a responsibility to champion the interests of their people who elected them. In any case if Turkana gets a community share pf oil, maasai foe maasai mara etc why not the rest too? Whats wrong with all n sundry agitating with what they feel is rightfully needful
1692 2018-10-31 20:07:12 Burning the midnight oil w @missjillscott. Had forgotten how your albums get me on a 100+ productivity scale!! #backonthegrind #SleepIsForTheWeak (says the lover of sleep) but work's gotta be done. #LoveMeSomeJill #realmusic
1693 2018-10-31 20:07:11 Castor oil might help too!
1694 2018-10-31 20:07:08 So if he works for her i assume he has security clearance for Westminster,oh dear oh dear hypocrisy abounds again ,and they wonder why Mps have  a profile lower than snake oil salesmen
1695 2018-10-31 20:07:03 They didnt bka.e the oil price spike on food increases lol
1696 2018-10-31 20:07:02 Why are you wanting your dad to try CBD Oil?
1697 2018-10-31 20:07:00 Skinny niggas cannot date skinny women that’s like oil and water
1698 2018-10-31 20:06:57 Bought by oil is Cornyn.
1699 2018-10-31 20:06:38 I take CBD oil 25 mg in a gummies and use it topical on joints 75 mg.  It does make a difference.
1700 2018-10-31 20:06:17 I agree, the length of time and effort it takes to render a real oil painting, I believe that extra commitment shows in the final piece.
1701 2018-10-31 20:06:15 LOL so you don't debate a "front group for oil n gas" because you are a "front group" for the Green dreamers. Okay that makes so much sense @FriendsOScience
1702 2018-10-31 20:06:14 YA OIL AINT READY BECAUSE U AINT GOT NO FIRE NIECE
1703 2018-10-31 20:06:08 Saudis Sunni-Wahabis also produce a lot of terrorists. For instance Saudi citizens carried out 911. You r lucky we did not bomb u back into the stone age and take your oil for free.
1704 2018-10-31 20:05:47 Shameless fear mongering from a party that’s a wholly owned subsidiary of big oil.
1705 2018-10-31 20:05:40 Not suprised. They live big oil
1706 2018-10-31 20:05:33 There will be plenty of guys on the market, they just need to ship wisley. Personally, I would've liked them to grab Lehner this past off-season but that ship has ilkely sailed.
1707 2018-10-31 20:04:55 I'm bored at work and just creeped and saw this. 100% agree with Kristen. I've never gone anywhere but Platinum for my oil change.
1708 2018-10-31 20:04:55 Price of oil is also killing the economic boom end product....
Simple addition and subtraction...

1711 2018-10-31 20:04:26 Lol. "Term oil" I wonder why people think Conservatives are stupid

使わせてもらってます！！！
1716 2018-10-31 20:03:53 Snap but we’re currently on oil so hopefully the carbon savings will be massive! (Even though I know our green electricity tariff is still really just off the grid...)
1717 2018-10-31 20:03:44 Might pour olive oil into a spray bottle
1718 2018-10-31 20:03:39 I never said average goalies win you a cup, just that there a far more than people think across the league and as we have seen with the Oilers, not all teams play a defensively sound system. For me, there isn't a significant gap between good and average.
1719 2018-10-31 20:03:29 Price of oil is also killing the economic boom end product....
Simple addition and subtraction...
1720 2018-10-31 20:03:26 I guess that is a resounding yes !! Lets hear from people all over the country fighting to protect our environment , the issues they are facing , whether it relates to habitat loss , continued use of oil,gas,peat, sea level rise, temperature rise etc. etc...
1721 2018-10-31 20:03:19 Who’s hip to CBD oil?
1722 2018-10-31 20:03:19 Yes, dip the raw plant in good olive oil to soften. I’ll die here
1723 2018-10-31 20:03:17 I read that if an older cat is having trouble accepting a younger one, put oil or water from a can of tuna  on the youger one, which will tempt the older one to groom them. You could try that with merlin getting the tuna oil.
1724 2018-10-31 20:03:14 Ok. So far u have offered a question as an answer 2 a question. And now this. Oh and then you come back with everything is made of oil. I get it. You have no solution. Just like the PC party. Your plan is to do nothing. That’s going to lose the election. Try another strategy.
1725 2018-10-31 20:03:10 Spilled nag champa oil all over my passport and border patrol asked if we were burning incense , oopsie ...
1726 2018-10-31 20:03:07 This is just a political squirrel. He’s trying to distract from the term oil in the stick market, trade war, and push the Khashoggi murder off the front pages...
1727 2018-10-31 20:03:00 Looks like all who have raw oil is an enemy of greedy Jewish of USA. ;) Russia, EU, UK, USA...
1728 2018-10-31 20:02:55 Lol.. your self mate. The plan cover basic stuff like pollen filters, air filter, engine oil and funny stuff.
1729 2018-10-31 20:02:30 Oil chafu imemwagika kwenye maj lazma samak waelee picha ndo linaanza
1730 2018-10-31 20:02:20 Castor Oil
1731 2018-10-31 20:02:14 He's too late. They have already found a way around the sanctions including NOT using the US dollar in trading...also before sanctions on oil hits, China has taken possession of 30 million barrels of oil that they will sell for Iran...all without using the US dollar.
1732 2018-10-31 20:02:02 my brother just said it smells like oil sex in here ..  its not that hes not stupid .
1733 2018-10-31 20:01:59 I gave a hundred dollars to a sexy ass masked man because I've got too much daddy's oil money @EditerEMH
1734 2018-10-31 20:01:57 For sure  you can get the sunflower oil spray which is good  in Tesco they sell it! You’ll have more control then 
1735 2018-10-31 20:01:54 Corruption and stealing of public funds have always been the oil that lubricates the social,  economic,  political and religious engines of NGR for the benefits of the elites, civil servants and religious leaders while the masses continue to be pulled down into extreme poverty.
1736 2018-10-31 20:01:35 As long as China, Asia and Europe have enough USD trade surplus, interest rates can stay low. If oil in price and volume eats up the surplus, long term interests soar. As the volume of oil imports is higher, the tipping price point is also lower now.
1737 2018-10-31 20:01:34 idk why people dip their bread in oil lmao thats so nasty like yall know we dont have tastebuds for oil like you just eating pure grease
1738 2018-10-31 20:01:24 Just gotta figure out how to get this oil pan off
1739 2018-10-31 20:01:22 Oil
1740 2018-10-31 20:01:11 Most likely Rwanda. In the next 20 years, machines will do more of the jobs allowing man more time to relax and see the world. Rwanda's investment in tourism will pay off more than gold and crude oil. 
1741 2018-10-31 20:01:09 T Boone and his oil position in the 2000's run up. Remember in an interview he said he pyramided up the whole way. Cant remember exactly but something crazy like 10x his fund.
1742 2018-10-31 20:01:06 The government of El Salvador has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Azealia Banks in a foulard wig.
1743 2018-10-31 20:01:04 Natural gas is burned off into the air if not used for heat because guess what it's a byproduct of oil production and absolutely everything is made with oil.
1744 2018-10-31 20:00:52 I just read it. That’s a little too much over reach by oil and gas. Even in Texas we don’t put up with that shit. Community says no then that means no. Gov should never grant seniority over personal property rights. That’s not an environmental issue. They are using force
1745 2018-10-31 20:00:44 yeah the last time there was, was over a week ago.

I've gone 2 weeks now without CBD oil, and my health has suffered :(

1750 2018-10-31 19:59:50 Just read in KC Star that Hawley is bringing  in deep money from out state.What that means he is going to owe people favors from out of State not Missouri. Vote here for this drug for this oil co. or this merger. People who say other are corrupt are usually corrupt to the core.

1753 2018-10-31 19:59:29 #palmoil is a clear example of the opportunities of sustainable development. Achieving  sustainable palm oil sourcing means addressing most of the #SDGs. One ingredient that involves 11 of the #SDGs:1,2,3,4,5,8,10,12,13,15,17 #GARsupportsSDGs
1754 2018-10-31 19:59:27 Do you ever think about the fact that the old doctors who bled patients were really close to discovering oil changes?
1755 2018-10-31 19:59:22 Everything is made with oil ...everything
1756 2018-10-31 19:59:18 Big Oil Pours Record $30M to Sway Voters Against Nation's First Carbon Tax: If voters approve Initiative 1631 on Nov. 6, Washington state will take a significant step in climate action by becoming the first state in the nation to enact a fee on carbon emissions... unless Big…
1757 2018-10-31 19:59:07 I'd been using oil.. sod this though, I'm switching back
1758 2018-10-31 19:59:04 All that carbon is recycled! Cow aren’t eating coal or oil!

1761 2018-10-31 19:58:32 Aleppo, Syria, is the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. Meanwhile the Saudis, who were burning camel dung to heat their houses not that long ago, became "princes" due to oil and have worked to destroy ancient Syria by funding ISIS, just as they funded 9-11.
1762 2018-10-31 19:58:27 So im making Daddy fried chicken tonight, i need help yall ... How i make it all extra crunchy ? The whole flower & oil isnt working for us lmao

1768 2018-10-31 19:57:25 Agree, many patients want oil or capsules.
1769 2018-10-31 19:57:19 Also sooo many doing humanitarian work in Syria and those oil rigs must be getting over crowded. 
1770 2018-10-31 19:56:54 I’ve had a bit of relief from Olbas Oil, but I may try this tomorrow. Thank you xx
1771 2018-10-31 19:56:51 you gonna be smelling like peanut oil lmaoooo
1772 2018-10-31 19:56:43 I bloody hate the stuff  literally ruins everything!! I’ve converted back to using like a tiny bit of oil as cba with buying new pans all the time 
1773 2018-10-31 19:56:41 If I break your heart nah oil spillage.
1774 2018-10-31 19:56:19 An oil drum for catching rainwater...Ack!  A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting!
1775 2018-10-31 19:56:19 Why can’t I be a normal person who just puts normal sauce on things. Instead I slather oyster sauce and sesame oil on everything which sugar and salt content will inevitably kill me
1776 2018-10-31 19:56:17 this bitch in my philosophy class just got vegetable oil out of her bag and took a sip. happy halloween
1777 2018-10-31 19:56:16 Trump's travel ban on Venezuela pushed it to default on Citgo, which Russia could own. Houston, we have an RU + Kingdom of Saudi Arabia problem!!
By crashing Venezuela (largest oil competitor of the KSA), Trump crashed Central America's economy for RU + KSA. #ClimateCrashCaravan!
1778 2018-10-31 19:56:14 If oil dries up, all our politicians will quit politics, and Nigeria will be free to progress #ThinkingOutLoud

Isu Eni ti ti owo Eni BO epo ( my yam has forced my hands into palm oil).
1780 2018-10-31 19:56:11 I think I see the problem.  You forgot to install an oil filter.
1781 2018-10-31 19:56:11 A responsibility and problem, but with the benefits of more natural resources to be pillaged by the "victors", profiteers, & financiers of perpetual war, not to mention the wealth of oil and mineral reserves, like in #Afghanistan. You don't think this is all by accident, do you?
1782 2018-10-31 19:56:07 Wonderful! Yes-everyone needs to know that ALL of them are charlatans-selling the 'moderate' snake oil while being completely beholden Pelosi-queen of the unhinged, insane MOB who have NO platform-oh except for, lets see: Open Borders, Crime and Gangs like Ms-13, pandering
1783 2018-10-31 19:55:53 Recently they have started to rise

Tensions with Iran are going to result in rise of Oil prices

1787 2018-10-31 19:54:55 Imran khans begging didnt help I am afraid but question remains where the hell did 6 billion oil money go
1788 2018-10-31 19:54:55 And all of that simply because of oil, which is the reason why Saudi Arabia has so much power in the region and it's such a close ally of the U.S.
Capitalism is wonderful thing - for the ruling class, that is. Not so much for everyone else.
1789 2018-10-31 19:54:50 i cant wait to oil cleanse tonight i dont enjoy being caked up like i used to

1796 2018-10-31 19:53:57 i always have a hard time with dealers because... i tend to make sure i keep things like the oil changed and my tires in good shape. it's not really until my engine starts acting up that i start to even pay attention to the parts associated with it.
1797 2018-10-31 19:53:55 Ordered 2 oil filled radiators.
Due Saturday.
1798 2018-10-31 19:53:51 So everyone that's brown is a thug, unless they have oil? Is this where we're going? Really?!?

1800 2018-10-31 19:53:16 Vroom- By far the worst car dealer in the US. Delivers are days late, paperwork is never sent, car arrives dirty and without oil in engine or gas in tank. I would avoid them. @BBBTriCounties @__vroomvroom__ @tedcruz

1804 2018-10-31 19:52:47 Agreed, whats in front helps a lot and last year it was part of our struggle.  Talbot needs to be one of our best players nightly for us to win.  If we don't resign him, what the next step especially if Koskenin doesn't work?  i don't see teams giving away good goalies.
1805 2018-10-31 19:52:47 I've got to go now Mr Robot but I hope you get a re-charge and that oil change. Maybe you're next programmer can make you less Homophobic and then maybe you will realise that if the leader of you're political party is a racist degenerate then you need to prioritise.
1806 2018-10-31 19:52:47 the government should be the only place 2 purchase a firearm

you want to buy a weapon or ammunition, "dot gov"
let them regulate, they don't want 2 legislate
allow Big Gun as they allow Big Oil, Big Tobacco, Big Money

1810 2018-10-31 19:52:23 /CL  oil take a look at it here
1811 2018-10-31 19:52:15 Reuters survey: Production also slipped further in Venezuela, where a lack of funds for the oil industry because of the country’s economic crisis is cutting refinery operations and crude exports. @AlexLawler100 #PDVSA #vzla #petroleo #opep
1812 2018-10-31 19:52:11 It’s because of all the oil and coal you’re burning.
1813 2018-10-31 19:52:01 Hahaha! It’s okay. I work in oil & gas, so I get the seriousness of the issue.
1814 2018-10-31 19:51:51 Cerelac, red oil, garri n spaghetti. ONLY
1815 2018-10-31 19:51:46 In all the @Channel4News reports re midterm elections in the US and current US economic situation, there have been no interviews where the expansion of the coal/oil/mining industries & their impact on health/environment/climate/pp  are ever mentioned. They are all interconnected
1816 2018-10-31 19:51:41 it's curious to me that a laissez-faire capitalist would want to dismantle the oil industry and end private prisons. why not let the free market govern itself?
1817 2018-10-31 19:51:36 I’m about to put some Wild Growth Oil on my eyebrows 
1818 2018-10-31 19:51:32 Once I hear Perez talk about oil and gas, I’ll be certain it is actually Adam.
1819 2018-10-31 19:51:23 Kenya takes the crown growth projections at 6%, oil discovery coupled with massive infrastructure outlay the Kenyan economy has a huge head start
1820 2018-10-31 19:51:12 They were also working to open up public parks to oil drilling and chemical mining. Why would I cheer for someone who wants to hurt the people and places Iove?
1821 2018-10-31 19:51:10 I am pretty sure in Brexit Britain we will be seeing a lot more of that. Because we will need to use upcycled fry oil for our non-polar needs. I plan to capitalise on this by becoming a modern day Nudelman - wanna know the residual peaks of a black pudding supper?
1822 2018-10-31 19:51:08 @DonLagreca donnie there no white chocolate it's made from butter cream not cocoa  it's like margarine it dyed yellow and put in the dairy section but its  solidified oil it's just to market it
1823 2018-10-31 19:51:03 So AAA got the low on oil change prices...the rep better not have lied
1824 2018-10-31 19:51:00 Never said most teams have elite goalies, said a few elite goalies and a lot of good goalies.  Goalies are funny humans, can be lights out and then shit the bed the next game.  but i strongly believe you can't win the cup without a good to elite goalie, average does't win cups.

1828 2018-10-31 19:50:09 *pours out a little bit of donut batter into hot oil*
1829 2018-10-31 19:50:03 Pretty sure he was included to help feed the Nylander narrative ;)
1830 2018-10-31 19:50:02 I generally watch prices for a very long time until I think I am getting value.  Pair of jeans - I’d probably tolerate as much as 10%.  Heating oil (I live in Germany) - much lower threshold - maybe 3-4% and then I’m waiting and watching the markets again.
1831 2018-10-31 19:50:00 Fried chicken that tastes like old oil 
1832 2018-10-31 19:49:59 What does that have to do with oil?  They won't care
1833 2018-10-31 19:49:58 Let me know how you feel about it. Coconut oil should last awhile btw. A little goes a long way! It burns easy too so be careful. I heard it’s great for shaving too.
1834 2018-10-31 19:49:57 So my new car is being a poop poo head! Won’t start. Sounds like a dead battery. Only clicks. The screen to check my miles and oil n stuff says to service my stability trac...not sure what that is... will have to you tube that. Thank goodness my son has a car
1835 2018-10-31 19:49:19 In flowers main sa itna oil nikal aya ga k subha egg fry ho jay ga lolxxx ohh thankyouuuu
1836 2018-10-31 19:49:10 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
1837 2018-10-31 19:49:08 Craving mcdo fries, fresh out the oil
1838 2018-10-31 19:49:06 Ok. You clearly are well-versed in o&g subject matter. I am not.  Do you think that $CHK is a decent value if the deal closes and oil and gas rates hold these levels?
1839 2018-10-31 19:49:03 Drake beard smell like shea butter and almond oil
1840 2018-10-31 19:48:33 Oil prices fall on signs of rising global supply
1841 2018-10-31 19:48:29 2019 is going to be an ideology based election, we'll vote individuals not party.
1842 2018-10-31 19:48:26 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1843 2018-10-31 19:48:17 Global oil prices are rising because of the Iran situation. The currency adjustment is something  that was delayed like a mofo. The ease of the past couple years of stability really made no sense based on indicators. Wtf is all the surprise about?
1844 2018-10-31 19:48:08 I predict that within a couple of weeks that savings per litre will be swallowed up by oil companies and added to profits. The citizens of Ontario will get no carbon tax credit and still pay high prices. How is this a win?@fordnation Trump wanna be
1845 2018-10-31 19:48:03 Ya can see this ending up like a picket line. Anyone got a spare oil drum to make a fire brazier?
1846 2018-10-31 19:47:57 So I started putting castor oil in my mascara and my lashes are really long asf now 
1847 2018-10-31 19:47:50 Cash
1848 2018-10-31 19:47:50 Rosey lemme alone ooo ... Oil is oil 
1849 2018-10-31 19:47:40 I doubt it if Atiku emerge he won't borrow too cos a nation that can't invest in Agriculture or empower its citizens or create enable enivornment to excel. We are drain when oil finish our eyes go clear
1850 2018-10-31 19:47:36 You like breakfast foods right? Well next time use coconut oil in place of whatever you normally use for like pancakes or French toast. Just don’t use it for things that should have a hardier taste like eggs lol. Well, unless you like sweet eggs.
1851 2018-10-31 19:47:32 Yes I care about humanity and the preservation of it. Sorry GOP is hell bend on destroying everything waiting for their maker to MAKE IT ALL BETTER. As always passing the buck. They drill in your head if they could get oil.
1852 2018-10-31 19:47:26 A few days late on our three-year anniversary, but got the whip an oil change and a full-service wash today #effort
1853 2018-10-31 19:47:24 @katienolan @AshleyBraband another cover for 2 in a 1bath is sprinkle essential oil before you. oil blocks odor. So you dont have to 2flush which if you can hear both flushes you know what's going down.
1854 2018-10-31 19:47:14 WAKE UP EARLIER THAN THE DEVIL AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR COVENANT SERVICE TOMORROW, 1ST OF NOVEMBER BY 6:30 AM, AS WE SPEAK LIFE INTO THE NEW MONTH. Come with a bottle of Olive oil. Beyond limits.
1855 2018-10-31 19:47:14 EVERYTHING is going to be more expensive, Fuel and oil is the bloodline of every large economy and until we can manufacture more earth friendly emissions and filtering devices there is no sense in PUNISHING every civilian in canada for trying to live their fucking life.
1856 2018-10-31 19:46:57  but it’s an essential oil
1857 2018-10-31 19:46:56 Higher taxes. No more Texas oil.  Open borders.  Socialism rules.  Exactly what Texas needs.
1858 2018-10-31 19:46:55 But I found my rose oil!!!!! Woooooo
1859 2018-10-31 19:46:47 Talbot wasn't good last year but was fantastic the year before, when he fell just short of being nominated for the Vezina. That's not who he is but had a wonderful season. The issue remains the same, the team in front of him. It's not all on the goalie.
1860 2018-10-31 19:46:40 are you in Spain Wander ?
1861 2018-10-31 19:46:34 DEAR AUTO SHOPS PLEASE STOP TRYING TO ROB ME AND TELL ME I NEED $2000 OF EXTRA WORK ON MY CAR WHEN I JUST WANT AN OIL CHANGE BC I PROMISE MY DAD WILL BE ON THE PHONE WITHIN THE NEXT 30 SECONDS
1862 2018-10-31 19:46:27 Brake oil atink.  Can't answer the second one
1863 2018-10-31 19:46:21 Lol you're our problem probably
1864 2018-10-31 19:46:17 You are correct, but KSA is totally dependent on oil hence MBS push to diversify economy. Let us hope that he can do it. I fear your monarchy system of government will inhibit inward investment and therefore inhibit diversification progress.
1865 2018-10-31 19:46:12 Nate’s coconut oil?
1866 2018-10-31 19:46:06 If anyone needs a good lip color, Maybelline Matte Ink is killer.
It goes on and STAYS on through seriously everything.
Didn't dry out my lips either.
And when you're ready for it to come off, baby oil does the trick.
1867 2018-10-31 19:46:05 Plus side is that UKOG have Solos10% now which the Majors will like when the start talks. And 10% more profit from all the Oil being tankered over to BP at Hamble and sold .
1868 2018-10-31 19:45:51 Jumped my car last night after trying to do a pull broke my oil pan and tie rod at 4am then fixed it all on the side of the road that next day because when I woke up it had a sheriffs tow sticker on the back.
1869 2018-10-31 19:45:46 Anointed with groundnut oil abi

1873 2018-10-31 19:45:31 Lmfao that’s not even why I was laughing though  the fact that you but baby oil in the shower took me out, the visual of you falling and all
1874 2018-10-31 19:45:30 l see u got plenty of cooking oil
1875 2018-10-31 19:45:28 FYI
300 Day Plan
Dhabeji Frieght will be launched to move all Containers, Oil & Gas Freight from/too West & East Wharf for delivery/collection outside the city
This will help more efficient movement of freight, less traffic & pollution for our City
1876 2018-10-31 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1877 2018-10-31 19:45:15 "Indeed, technology capturing CO2 emissions is vital for oil and natural gas to thrive in a world addressing climate change". False. CCS and DAC are needed, but oil has no place in a world addressing climate change.
1878 2018-10-31 19:45:14 Why stress?

Whenever that happens to me, I just take it that they're telling me that while I was fixated on burning the midnight oil studying, their parents who are my age, were busy mating.
1879 2018-10-31 19:45:03 I don't know about oil, but he has definitely performed well in gassing around.
1880 2018-10-31 19:44:56 Government of pakistan becoming a joke in western media also. Meanwhile imran khans begging also hasnt helped. Oil prices increased by massive margins in pakistan
1881 2018-10-31 19:44:46 Spotify oh my whole phone in the morning is changing  cute email I didn't even played that i get castor oil for understanding
1882 2018-10-31 19:44:44 Electric vehicles could have been the norm but oil conglomerates won’t allow that to happen.
1883 2018-10-31 19:44:43 Kenya of course. We have more discoveries. Nigeria hasn't done much even with its own oil
1884 2018-10-31 19:44:08 They did this before. They even went so far as to remove all the e-cars that were on the road at the time. This is a conspiracy with Pumpkin Head and big oil.
1885 2018-10-31 19:44:07 Most top teams do not have elite goalies b/c there aren't that many. We have seen time and time again, how a goalie looks great in one situation but when they move teams, that are not so defensively sound, they suddenly don't look so good.
1886 2018-10-31 19:43:56 I think that he went through a faze where he could have ended up in a dark place,the same place our Adrian is in,but yes he seem to have something about him,just got all rolled up in the inner circle bullshit that bdi was into,and that was about blinkered views are the only way
1887 2018-10-31 19:43:43 No oil on carpet? Come on sort it out!
1888 2018-10-31 19:43:39 Yes, although WTI has pulled back a little less YTD. But yes - this was my thought. Inflation expectations are pretty closely following oil
1889 2018-10-31 19:43:37 India and its US allies can easily cut their oil from Iran, they lie that it is hard for them, believe it is very convenient. They only think of their own interests and deceive your government. Exemptions are unacceptable, remove Israel from the White House
1890 2018-10-31 19:43:34 yay my fingers are doing some weird peely thing at the tip and under my nails so i put castor oil on all my fingers and now everything is oily
1891 2018-10-31 19:43:30 Girrrrrl, I used Olive oil + Leave-in Conditioner + Eco style gel(for the tips). Should be great substitute.
1892 2018-10-31 19:43:21 But he sooo wrong for umapitsi ngamanzi ne oil
1893 2018-10-31 19:43:16 advice from my mechanic on who can put oil in my car:
1. my dad
2. my boyfriend 
3. my brother (audible laughter)
4. me
1894 2018-10-31 19:43:01 My son asked his friends while trick-or-treating: "I wonder what we'd get if we asked in the pharmacy?"

It turns out the answer was samples of multi-vitamins. At least if wasn't  cod liver oil!
1895 2018-10-31 19:42:54 The most dangerous time to drive a vehicle is actually 30 minutes BEFORE the rain, due to the oil on the road and the perpetual lack of caution from drivers in these situations
1896 2018-10-31 19:42:50 Good job Im not a dum ass. Topped up today. Look forward to results.

1897 2018-10-31 19:42:50 Amazing podcast!! I can’t wait until XO18!! The haters will be scrambling to find and create new narratives after the event! Oh Dealer you are my favorite Snake Oil Salesman ever!!
1898 2018-10-31 19:42:48 I agree with you pharmad.  Basic fish oil the old way of thinking.  Not safe, short shelf life.  No idea what your taking as far as benefit or detriment. That article is 3 years old.
1899 2018-10-31 19:42:48 Scam Alert : Indian scam fuckers are now taking out local newspaper Personal Ads pretending to be retiring Oil executives who want to find love. Once a woman replies, they then ask for cash to close a business deal.
Wankers.
1900 2018-10-31 19:42:45 洗濯手段なさすぎか！！
1901 2018-10-31 19:42:42 No true. Last I checked I'm not big oil and I support No on this disaster of an initiative. Why the hell would anyone want MORE taxes to fund leftist wet dream projects with no accountability? The Yes campaign is championed by Big Socialists who want to control you. #WalkAway
1902 2018-10-31 19:42:38 It's a significant bump, as I mentioned, but I'd also note that it comes as the oil and gas industry -- which consumes a lot of steel -- was coming out of a two-year slump.
1903 2018-10-31 19:42:23 The best skin care routine that works for me: wash face with water only or diluted with a gentle cleanser, exfoliate once a week, SPF moisturizer & use olive oil before bed & just drinks lots of water
1904 2018-10-31 19:42:22 It all seems related. Super convoluted and wild. Fascinating stuff how the storm water and waste water systems affect our watershed. And how downstream neighbors and cows and oil and gas and people all tell their stories through the watershed and the manifest destiny of the west.
1905 2018-10-31 19:42:17 In the name of the oil, I will endamage you!
1906 2018-10-31 19:41:27 But VERY good at increasing the profits of those they vilify. Such as BP (British Petroleum) creating huge profits in Q3 using ultra-cheap Canadian oil. The SAME BP that was vilified only a few years ago due to enormous spill in Gulf of Mexico. YES more unintended consequences
1907 2018-10-31 19:41:18 how your skin looks when you come out of the shower and oil it down >>>>

1909 2018-10-31 19:40:43 You are conveniently ignoring the energy required to 1.) drill the oil, 2.) transport the crude, 3.) refine the product, 4.) transport the gas, and 5.) pump the final result.
1910 2018-10-31 19:40:34 I’m now the owner of a 2004 Ford Taurus with 74,000 miles on it. New ac new tires oil was changed three months ago and it was a fuckin fleet car so it was constantly maintained. Welcome to the family Fat Louie!!!!
1911 2018-10-31 19:40:34 When you use condom and she still gets pregnant just know the oil in the condom is anointing oil. You cannot come and waste children 
1912 2018-10-31 19:40:34 Who h school Wich state which time which food which which which which? Hahahahahaha with all the oil booms under you @OfficialPDPNig you could not feed even disabled schools...shame shame shame propagandists.
1913 2018-10-31 19:40:27 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
1914 2018-10-31 19:40:27 You just have to tell them you need an oil change, they say pull your car up. Change it for you. Pay. Drive away 
1915 2018-10-31 19:40:14 Winter's coming! The peasants need heat!
So raise the price of oil! Raise the price of coal.
Raise the price of GAS! And raise the price of WAX.
For #Capitalists must #NEVER_BE_LAX.
1916 2018-10-31 19:40:09 Oil marketing companies are smart! With the feel good & proud factor from WB upping ease of biz ranking ruling India at this time, they seized the opportunity to up their price.

1919 2018-10-31 19:40:05 Family Nutrition: #Ritz Original Crackers this November? Its top four ingredients are flour, soybean oil, sugar and cottonseed oil.
1920 2018-10-31 19:40:04 Hehehe oil plenty
1921 2018-10-31 19:40:00 U better go and feed ur hungry dog.. Useless human.. Tell ur baba that if e can't invest in kwara or point to his achievements in kwara e can go back to his oil business
1922 2018-10-31 19:39:57 Market II: #Crude #Oil is at a critical juncture again. It's the leading major financial asset of 2018. From $60.42/barrel on Jan 1, #WTI #futures have hit a high of $76.90, up 27%. But a 4-week slide drops it below the long-term 200-day MA. Monitor it via $USO #inflation #energy
1923 2018-10-31 19:39:36 #VotingIsAsImportantAs getting an oil change for your car. It can break if you don't change it.
1924 2018-10-31 19:39:33 Will you people please read the damn articles not just the headlines! The report even says it does not take into consideration pipelines and flow lines. Drilling is only a small part of oil and gas development. 112 is 2500 ft setback on ALL development not just drilling.
1925 2018-10-31 19:39:27 Snake oil sales man
1926 2018-10-31 19:39:19 Why was the first thing I grabbed to drink after my workout was some oil 
1927 2018-10-31 19:39:17 Connors was underrated, as was Lendl. The guy had a wonderful career and just b/c he didn't win Wimbledon, doesn't get the props he deserves. Lost to Becker and Pat Cas playing out of his mind in two finals and reached the SF 5 other times.
1928 2018-10-31 19:38:54 see ehh just follow back dude oil dey your head.
1929 2018-10-31 19:38:51 Yes, long way to go!

How about 80-95% of the oil gone.

25% of the cost of goods is fuel.  Cut 80% and you save 20%.  The boom will be enormous with my engine.  

Fly for 4 cents/mile fuel at 200 mph.  Less than road tax, tires and brakes (6-8 cents/mile).  Like free fuel.
1930 2018-10-31 19:38:49 فيه مشروع oil to chemicals وهو قيد الدراسة وله نائب تنفيذي في سابك ، وفيه مسألة بيع حصة صندوق الاستثمارات لارامكو .. بس ما سمعنا عن تطور جديد في أي من الموضوعين
1931 2018-10-31 19:38:45 Lots of dump asses spooked because they didn’t listen properly and thought there would be no news till the drill had finished.
1932 2018-10-31 19:38:42 Your thoughts on the Iran deal and its effects on oil biz?
1933 2018-10-31 19:38:39 Except Dems like the republicans support oil pipelines and fracking.
1934 2018-10-31 19:38:13 I need some coconut oil.
1935 2018-10-31 19:38:03 スケボーしても死にたくなると思うから死ぬべきかも！
1936 2018-10-31 19:38:02 I hate coming to car shops to get oil changes they tell me a bunch of shit every time like  I don’t wanna hear that
1937 2018-10-31 19:38:00 Ffs where the hell have you lot been,  GW pharmaceutical synth oil has been reported with side effects and deaths,no side effects with raw, did you know GW pharmaceutical is robbing uk farmers/communitys of poss earnings of $60,000 per acre, according to defra uk 9.4 mill hec.
1938 2018-10-31 19:37:59 Wrong on many levels, incl:

1. Anemic, micro sausages 
2. Egg yolks not cooked on top, should have been flicked with hot oil or flipped
3. Brown/dry toast
4. Too many tomatoes
5. Whole carb-protein ratio wrong
1939 2018-10-31 19:37:49 pretty big into the oil and ass stuff now in #porn one of my #outlandish cravings, big into the asshole just even looking at it
1940 2018-10-31 19:37:43 finding out Chipotle cooks everything in rice bran oil put a HUGE damper on Halloween
1941 2018-10-31 19:37:43 So special you acted like a RAT to get to a club run by rats with oil money.  Suits you
1942 2018-10-31 19:37:42 Yeah scientists  have slanted studies but the billion dollar oil industry don't.
1943 2018-10-31 19:37:35 oh no! ! quick drop of oil should silence that.
1944 2018-10-31 19:37:20 Rub on some olive oil all over your *body* and dress as Janet Jackson's 'Nip Slip.
1945 2018-10-31 19:37:15 This tweet shows that you are as fake as it gets. Constantly looking for an angle to promote your snake oil, instead of showing true compassion and empathy. There isn't a sincere bone in that fat body of yours. #FakePresident #FailedHumanBeing
1946 2018-10-31 19:37:09 Pawpaw and palm oil
1947 2018-10-31 19:36:51 Fight for Alberta. Will sue the bc government. Will shut off the oil pipelines. Will take business away from bc. Etc
1948 2018-10-31 19:36:50 Don't debate that anti science front group for oil n gas.

Ur ref to them only highlights your trolling
1949 2018-10-31 19:36:42 Я одна проорала это в голос, танцуя этот долбаный танец?
1950 2018-10-31 19:36:35 sorry i see alot of good true # 1's, few elite goalies and then average.  most top teams have true #1 and elite goals. the rest struggle with average goalies.  look at what an average talbot did for us last year.  cant win or far without a good goalie.  Flames is a good example.
1951 2018-10-31 19:36:29 Na most of your mums use to slap astral cream on your faces before you left for school, my mum would slap OIL
1952 2018-10-31 19:36:26 Under Obama, India was given an exemption for Iran oil. Being a strategic Ally and being these exemptions are agreed behind doors, India be okay IMHO
1953 2018-10-31 19:35:55 We had a small UFO cult in my hometown, and one of them taught me how to oil paint.
1954 2018-10-31 19:35:48 First time actually paying for an oil change. I’m clue less smh
1955 2018-10-31 19:35:43 Yes! Cayanne, Kosher salt, garlic powder, olive oil and a little bitter. 
1956 2018-10-31 19:35:40 Olives are pressed to get oil,
Fruits are squeezed for juice,
Flowers are crushed for perfume,

These are the methods used to get goodness out of things,

So whenever you feel crushed, squeezed or pressed, it means ALLAH is trying to get the best out of you.
1957 2018-10-31 19:35:39 @Oil_Drop Great challenge to think about all-time top 10. I can go back to Tony Trabert, Vic Seixas and others in the 50s-60s, but I don't think any have been better than these three. Connors IMO has been under-rated, but not better than Borg.
1958 2018-10-31 19:35:31 3 weeks?
1959 2018-10-31 19:35:31 May the oil on Tope Alabi’s life never run dry. God bless her
1960 2018-10-31 19:35:25 I thought it was good too.
1961 2018-10-31 19:35:24 なんか下系にはあんまり食いついてこないイメージが合った
1962 2018-10-31 19:34:49 not sorry 
1963 2018-10-31 19:34:37 Ooops sorry, I snorted motor oil. T:
1964 2018-10-31 19:34:36 Well that doesn't make any sense.

"U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the Trump administration wants sanctions on Iran's crude exports, but does not want to harm countries that depend on the oil"
1965 2018-10-31 19:34:30 Duuuude...
1966 2018-10-31 19:34:28 you do too ... have you even CONSIDERED the energy losses due to extracting the oil and refining it? I doubt it even though you are quick to point a finger ... and where I live the grid is almost entirely renewable ...
1967 2018-10-31 19:34:15 Look all over the league, there are nothing but average goaltenders in most NHL cities. There are only a handful of really good goalies in the league.
1968 2018-10-31 19:34:05 ¿Mobilización?  ¿de Mobil oil o de Mobil celular?

Ah, lo que hace sentido es el dólar a $ 20.75
1969 2018-10-31 19:33:54 That fracking is so aweful 
To separate the oil from the soil they have to blast toxic chemicals into the dirt. Then the Chemicals go into the water poisoning the water. much of this oil is mined by other countries  & sent overseas .

1970 2018-10-31 19:33:42 Ended up staying over at a house party last night and I actually had the neck of taking extra virgin olive oil from the fellas press to take my makeup off like Jamie are you alright in the head?

1972 2018-10-31 19:33:22 If only we could just have the type of technology that our govt has and then no one would need oil or gas and everyone could have free energy

1974 2018-10-31 19:33:12 Does this mean you're going to present a carbon tax bill? Or a proposal to nationalize and wind down all domestic oil & gas companies? How about a WW2-level mobilization plan to de-carbonize our economy?
1975 2018-10-31 19:33:10 More than two hours of late-night talks between Russian government and oil producers have ended with the deal to freeze wholesale fuel prices until April
1976 2018-10-31 19:32:59 You don't ever tell the truth. Truth and Trump and like Oil and Water.
1977 2018-10-31 19:32:50 And lots of self-tanner + baby oil.
1978 2018-10-31 19:32:45 Federer is on another level from an entertainment standpoint but IMO, Nadal has played the tougher competition at their peak level during his career. For me, it's really close between Roger & Rafa w/ Djokovic coming. Arguably 3 best of all-time, which pains me as a Borg guy :)
1979 2018-10-31 19:32:44 Bullshit Claudia. Wall Street is deciding they’ve had enough of Trumponomics. He’s wiping out my 401k. Gas and fuel oil will only go up because that’s what his buddy Putin needs. He’s setting us up for the next recession or worse. And your grandkids have to deal with the debt.
1980 2018-10-31 19:32:38 Fuel oil? Fam u livin on a rez or something? Lol btw im not judging
1981 2018-10-31 19:32:38 I was getting my oil changed & made quite the scene laughing so hard!!
1982 2018-10-31 19:32:29 Well I already changed someone else's mind about CBD being snake oil today, so I'll leave it up to you to do your own research. Start by googling 'endocannabinoid system' cool stuff
1983 2018-10-31 19:32:24 is there an essential oil for when you get your feelings hurt or??
1984 2018-10-31 19:32:23 The smoke is residue oil burning off. Not uncommon for flames to shoot out of the odd prop aircraft, which can cause alarm if you're not used to it 
Takeoff was textbook, looks like either some form of tail rotor issue, a possible bird strike or I hate to suggest,drone strike
1985 2018-10-31 19:32:20 I had to sit thru 6 oil co ads in a row about prop112... They claim it will kill jobs... replace in clean energy sector!! Half measures aren't enuf. We need actually clean energy. They claim prop112 will cost $$... Our health & life on Earth shud b worth it. Read b4 u vote!
1986 2018-10-31 19:32:16 I’d love to see Cole still run cup but wouldn’t be apposed to seeing him back here in California running a Lucas oil mod,Spears srl or usac/cra!
1987 2018-10-31 19:32:02 What a Delta Bravo !!!!
1988 2018-10-31 19:31:37 This is not surprising.  AND it's one of the reasons I'm invested in TSLA.  It trades on it's own merit, because it stands apart in many ways, from the economy, from other tech companies, from car companies, from oil, and a few other things I'm sure.  R^2 of ~0.35 makes sense.
1989 2018-10-31 19:31:28 Folks pay good money for roller coaster rides at theme parks. You get it for free with #aaog so stop all the moaning, enjoy the ride and wait for the main event, which in case anyone has forgotten, its black stuff called oil.

1994 2018-10-31 19:31:04 Immigration is badly, and at times desperately, needed when we cannot stoop to doing the menial jobs that help oil the squeaky bigger wheels of an economy.

1999 2018-10-31 19:29:29 my hair is so thin and falls out at an alarming rate. I started putting vitamin e oil that I got from my health market and it’s helped! my eyelashes and brows growing too.
2000 2018-10-31 19:29:28 เสียความรู้สึกมากกว่าเดิมอีก
2001 2018-10-31 19:29:19 Agree on both points.
2002 2018-10-31 19:29:17 @realDonaldTrump Iran's oil should be completely cut off by November 4, the Swift must be cut off, President Trump, trust me and do not give up anyone, you see, the regime in Iran fears in Europe, should never be merciful to the greatest terrorist in the world
2003 2018-10-31 19:29:15 He has no common sense imo. I'm not easily baffled by bull shit .
2004 2018-10-31 19:29:07 @LindaFoods is the palm oil in your products sustainably sourced?
2005 2018-10-31 19:28:47 Burning this midnight oil tonight, and just had to share this beautiful lady at her farewell ... thank you Sylvia for choosing me to capture her beautiful picture ...
2006 2018-10-31 19:28:34 Took one of my Client Patients 16yr old Boy Semi #Nonverbal with #Autism to the #Gym & he did absolutely Awesome, this is thanks to the #CBDOIL, before taking Oil, he was Aggressive. Didn't like noises, Now noises don't bother him. It's the CBD Oil. @UMNSUCARD @DanMarinoFdtn
2007 2018-10-31 19:28:23 That's a switch. Most people who've tasted it feel the opposite.

It's great that CBD oil helps so many. There's the option of just putting raw cannabis in capsules & taking it that way since it's not activated (so not psychotropic), still getting benefits from many cannabinoids.
2008 2018-10-31 19:28:20 Cunners is very clever...why would you not agree ?
2009 2018-10-31 19:28:09 When you see your own jar of oil, do you see it as a seed or just a jar of oil. Your seed can be that job you have right now. What are you doing with it, are you sowing it or you treat it like harvest? If you take your seed, you don’t have any hope of harvest.

2011 2018-10-31 19:27:56 Sat outside the gym, tired after a 12 hour day and lack of sleep. Summoning up some hutzpah. Listening to midnight oil and beds are burning.  Not sure I’m coming down with something as motivation is never usually a problem.

2013 2018-10-31 19:27:47 I came to get an oil change for my car and I’ve been here for an hour an half 
2014 2018-10-31 19:27:45 this cbd oil blunt finna have me gone
2015 2018-10-31 19:27:38 I made my own Frappuccino. Premeir caramel protein shake and instant coffee and Tbsp of coconut oil then blend in my Ninja. Sure you could also use MCT oil.
2016 2018-10-31 19:27:38 I agree that the rise will come when production is realised. No Adrian does not deserve some of the things that are said about his personal life.
It is SS's time to make his stamp on Ukog in the next RNS's
2017 2018-10-31 19:27:30 いつも何考えてるかわかんないって言われます…
2018 2018-10-31 19:27:24 most team make average goaltending work??? which ones?? WE didn't make it wok after Rolli left!!
2019 2018-10-31 19:27:21 Kiehl’s midnight recovery cleanseing oil is what i needed a long time ugh and finally I found something good for my sensitive skin
2020 2018-10-31 19:27:16 Oh I get it, I also get that you’re a mid table club, awash with money. It’s nothing to be ashamed about, it takes more than 10 years to become huge. I’m sure you’ll get there in time. Providing the oil merchants stick around.
2021 2018-10-31 19:27:14 It's certainly a possibility. His Pickens plan has been around for many years but has fallen on deaf ears. Makes sense to me to convert big diesel trucks to #natgas which he says will amount to all of our #oil imports and we import much less oil now.
2022 2018-10-31 19:27:14 Not to be a useless stoner but I forgot my oil pen at home and work is going by SO S L O W
2023 2018-10-31 19:27:13 No surprise since there was already a case study to look at in Boston with their cap problems when he left.
2024 2018-10-31 19:27:12 I’ll bet there’s an essential oil cure for this...
2025 2018-10-31 19:27:05 Dan's memory may not be as good as some of the rest of us.
2026 2018-10-31 19:26:55 いや、いつもそんなテンションだったかなと思ってｗ
2027 2018-10-31 19:26:48 I heard eating chicken cooked in engine oil is the new way to get clout. Try that lol
2028 2018-10-31 19:26:25 Not true kake. The oil is sold internationally, and it is providing KRG with most of its budget. Comen bra you shouldn't spread false news.
2029 2018-10-31 19:26:24 Our income tax is ranked the lowest in the world and that's cos despite our huge population people don't have meaningful jobs. 
Which means govts only source of revenue continues to be oil.
2030 2018-10-31 19:26:23 Use anointing oil to rub your body 
2031 2018-10-31 19:26:22 Definitely tease from Victoria’s Secret, heavenly from Victoria’s Secret, and an oil called amber from Whole Foods. :)
2032 2018-10-31 19:26:19 Yeah the vape oil is different! But if you can find the vape oil, it'd probably be best for ya.
2033 2018-10-31 19:26:19 Well there are plenty of countries and people around the world who have good reason to hate the English but when your 'trusted'  and supposedly friendly neighbour steals >£1trn of Sc ot Oil and then to compound matters LIES about it then suppresses it??? Piss off
2034 2018-10-31 19:26:11 @realDonaldTrump Where is Bolton's warlord spirit gone, US allies can cut off Iran's oil, believe it's easy, they just excuse us. From Bolton, we did not expect such a speech, the exemption has no justification, and believe it will defeat the Republicans, I know things that I say
2035 2018-10-31 19:26:10 hi @benjyehuda! quick question for you: how is your meat protein prepared? namely, is there any added sugar or oil that isn't olive in the marinade? thank you in advance for your reply! 
2036 2018-10-31 19:26:07 and yet most other teams seem to find a way to make it work
2037 2018-10-31 19:25:59 so please boycott oil
2038 2018-10-31 19:25:56 あれ？？？何かおかしなこと口走った感じですか？？？
2039 2018-10-31 19:25:55 Orrrr, take his goddamn money people! We need Saudi oil
2040 2018-10-31 19:25:49 Or, this is corporate lobbying for Koch Industries which has a vested interest in the oil business.
2041 2018-10-31 19:25:36 We elected present crew because of performance of pc's but I expected better than taxation to the max and hold on with white knuckles in hopes oil saves us.
2042 2018-10-31 19:25:28 Consensus says Federer best ever. Where's the right place for Novak and Nadal on all-time list?
2043 2018-10-31 19:25:20 (also LOL @ "America First" - the end-market for the pipeline oil isn't even exclusively or mostly USA.)
2044 2018-10-31 19:25:18 P.s. We can also deliver olive oil to EIRE if you're interested drop us a an email or a message

2047 2018-10-31 19:24:42 To be fair, the moment they signed Lucic to the deal they did, this was always going happen. The fact we are now here should surprise absolutely no one.
2048 2018-10-31 19:24:42 You sure do look after your people well since you found the oil. Was not like that before the oil.
2049 2018-10-31 19:24:40 "Have you cut out electricity and stopped using oil?" No. And it's not realistic to think people will go to that extreme, but I use efficient bulbs, recycle, don't use pesticides, use a shovel rather than a snow blower, limit driving, take short showers, etc. Everything helps.
2050 2018-10-31 19:24:39 3:19PM 31OCT currently *NO WAIT* For State Inspections, oil change,  alignment, diagnostic, why wait when there is a Carmasters Vehicle  Available at Carmasters Automotive LLC for you to drive while yours is getting repaired (please reserve)
2051 2018-10-31 19:24:37 くーださい
2052 2018-10-31 19:24:37 The fact that I have to drive to Cary to get a free oil change, I might as well change the oil myself.
2053 2018-10-31 19:24:34 I have been neglecting foam rolling and taking cbs oil tho. That’s a really good idea
2054 2018-10-31 19:24:19 @VeteranOwned do y’all have a list of Vet beard grooming companies? Looking for a new beard oil and shave cream (for around the beard), and want to support Vets with Beards who make stuff...for beards
2055 2018-10-31 19:24:10 Said from my favourite english teacher, is an honour ! And you should try that olive oil, is amazing, better than a beer (a luxembourgish beer)

2057 2018-10-31 19:24:02 TIL it’s worth it to throw down the extra cash for burp-less fish oil.
2058 2018-10-31 19:23:57 Tentacle porn, but it’s me doing eight oil paintings at once of your mom getting rattled by Burt Reynolds.
2059 2018-10-31 19:23:52 scary thought, Talbot isn't our future #1 and Koskinen doesn't pan out, what next?  weve been there before without solid goaltending, poor McDavid if that happens.
2060 2018-10-31 19:23:49 You just said flat earthers are idiots and yet you physically have no proof as nor do they. Snake oil? Why because it doesn't coincide with your beliefs? You are the epitamy of a follower. You breathing up the air with others like you is why our atmosphere is being depleted.
2061 2018-10-31 19:23:42 when we were invaded by Americans during the oil glut of the 70s/80s......( in Aberdeen anyway )
2062 2018-10-31 19:23:42 Business is business. Right? Despite the non stop US´s attacks against Venezuela (JUST because Venezuela has the LARGEST OIL RESERVE IN TH WORLD) the US have no problem whatsoever with accepting payments from PDVSA, the Venezuela´s oil company.
2063 2018-10-31 19:23:41 Future news article: “How #Trump Lost India” - resulting in: #India trading with #China in #Yuan (reserve #currency challenge), India #trading #oil directly with #Iran (geopolitical impotence)...see recent “loss of soft power” article in Bloomberg Business Week

2066 2018-10-31 19:23:32 Don’t contaminate the oil
2067 2018-10-31 19:23:30 Alhough this may be due to some sort of PR campaign with growing malcontentedness towards oil companies and the success of the electric car, I wish for your prices to stay low. Because gas is becoming the "poorman's" energy with Electric cars are becoming expensive due to demand
2068 2018-10-31 19:23:23 Lyne I will . Back to reporting Facts not fiction.
2069 2018-10-31 19:23:20 For maintaining blood pressure: Coenzyme Q10, Cat's Claw, Garlic, Grape Seed Extract, and Coconut Oil (the concentrated pills).

2074 2018-10-31 19:22:51 The skweeky wheel gets the oil.
2075 2018-10-31 19:22:49 I do not care who buys what, i believe the big rise will come when production is realised,you might think i pick on feck bit he deserves every bit of it and turns on any one who has a different view to him,SS has not got a very good record up to now on the operational front only
2076 2018-10-31 19:22:42 Trade, education among top issues for rural Indiana voters xxx Well at least those farmers after being sold snake oil by Trump know they need to be educated...that's some progress...ignorance is not bliss..
2077 2018-10-31 19:22:25 100% and if it doesn't pan out, it's one year. In that sense, it's worth a shot but when your team is up against the cap, it's the kind of approach a GM simply cannot have.

2097 2018-10-31 19:20:23 I've been saying it since the summer. The reason they gave Koskinen the extra $$$ they did was in hopes of finding a starter on the sheap in '19-10. If that doesn't happen, they hit the UFA market and look for a value signing. They have no other choice.
2098 2018-10-31 19:20:23 (bpd) oil pumping station in its #kirkuk oilfield due to a crack in a key crude pipeline, two officials with the North Oil Company said on Wednesday.
2099 2018-10-31 19:20:15 Sitting in a #Honda service center being force fed Ellen on the TV. 2 hours for a goddamn oil change? Really?
2100 2018-10-31 19:20:15 I think Koskinen was overpaid because A: Chia is dumb and B: he is hoping for big future things for him
2101 2018-10-31 19:19:42 The tax masterstroke will destroy his politics of capitalizing on suffering masses. His Zidera caused most industries to close hence religious cows as in corporate and income tax dwindled. This caught him flatfooted and will oil the economy much to the detriment of his cause.
2102 2018-10-31 19:19:33 I found a day time fix to the “no ham in west Harlem” issue I’ve been having. The grocery stores are still Hispanic operated and have alllll the ham! And they have delis! Been living my best Ham, Swiss, tomato, salt, pepper, vinegar, oil, mayo, on a hero life...before midnight
2103 2018-10-31 19:19:31 We ended up getting rid of our deep fryer  in the end because we never used it after we got the air fryer.

Now if you are doing it the old manual oil in a pan way then I can't help much with that :P

2108 2018-10-31 19:19:12 agreed, can't fault a guy for back checking hard, too bad it led to a penalty.  The second goal, his whole lines to blame for that garbage and he was behind the goal scorer.

2117 2018-10-31 19:18:25 There is definetely a cost balance to be considered, between oil, power, baffle, plates and cooling vs the cost for turbos. It's ending up much higher than I originally planned, but at least now the system should be well controlled, extremely versatile, and modular.

2122 2018-10-31 19:18:03 Actually oil was reason for both at heart and fall of Ottoman empire. Greed always there. German-French-British greed fuels it for rich to earn billions while working classes slaughtered. WW3 coming you should be more bothered about. Syria was Spain 36. Mark my words. Iran 2022.
2123 2018-10-31 19:18:00 From an article in The Globe and Mail Oct 31 2018. In August of 2018 Canada purchased $497,000,000 worth of SAUDI OIL. 
A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS! 
IN ONE MONTH! GONE FROM CANADA! TO THE KINGDOM! 
Anyone know the total over the last 50 years?

2153 2018-10-31 19:14:35 This is perhaps best shown in the Oil Refinery mission in Shadow, it's great gameplay wise but serves no real purpose to the story and could be removed altogether with no consequence. This level was made first and the writers had to write a story around it.
2154 2018-10-31 19:14:33 Another question: why is there oil in your coolant?
2155 2018-10-31 19:14:30 Just in time for Halloween: Standard Oil has revealed that they can give enough energy for the entire world, just by taking energy from David Rockefeller rotating in his grave as his globalism is being destroyed. 
2156 2018-10-31 19:14:23 Two words... "Air Fryer".

Best purchase I ever made. The awesomeness of deep frying without all the bad for you oil.

Makes amazing toasted sandwiches as well ;D
2157 2018-10-31 19:14:10 We could do both and CDA would benefit significantly and even if CO2 is the control knob on climate ... these pipelines would have no impact on that as CDN oil would simply displace oil from less ethical regimes.
2158 2018-10-31 19:13:43 You are factually spurious - the "elite" were  wealthy families - Big Tobacco, Big Oil, in NRA, etc., & were the drivers of politics that influenced the government and public. There is more than 1 "elite", & using Hollywood as defacto solo-influencers is poor, intellectually
2159 2018-10-31 19:13:31 We'll see. Of course if we see WTI under $60 as I think we will in Q1, growth will slow. Oil now under major trendline. Ready to implode when markets don't shoot up 2% daily. This is going to hurt some!
2160 2018-10-31 19:13:31 Aye great catty  i used to oil the elastic to make it last longer 
2161 2018-10-31 19:13:14 Seriously guys roast your pumpkin seeds with olive oil, paprika salt black pepper it’s PENGGG
2162 2018-10-31 19:13:14 I sold half my holding off that podcast was a shocker. You clearly stated “tight hole” that clearly says u are not going to update on any oil shows but zones intersected
2163 2018-10-31 19:12:50 lmao listen, when I went to Tuscany I came home & threw all my olive oil away.  IMPOSTERS! it dont even taste the same! What is this shit!
2164 2018-10-31 19:12:46 Hmmm?  I wonder what alternatives might work?  If @NDP & @JustinTrudeau would get out of the way, we might get #EnergyEast going! That would eliminate oil tankers from Saudi Arabia - maybe that would pacify the head-in-the-sand group that would cancel the Saudi military contract.
2165 2018-10-31 19:12:46 That at least makes sense given that oil prices have gone up.
2166 2018-10-31 19:12:37 To check the oil in my coolent..
2167 2018-10-31 19:12:37 U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the Trump administration wants sanctions on Iran's crude exports to strain Tehran, but does not want to harm countries that depend on the oil.
2168 2018-10-31 19:12:28 Refugees aren't taking any oil with them, that's why they're being repelled
2169 2018-10-31 19:12:27 Oil is still going to be a potent and fast delivery method to see if you like it. You just use a little dropper under your tongue.

2176 2018-10-31 19:11:26 Because billionaires are by definition detached from the environment, entropy collects in their minds, causing their immorality. Thus, the wealthy would hoard fossil fuels, despite taxes, so only disbanding an oil company will prevent climate disaster, and promote democracy.
2177 2018-10-31 19:11:16 So we need millions more illegal aliens to compete with them for these same exact jobs? 
When exactly did you change your mind on this? 
I know for a fact that at one time you and rest of dems supported AMERICAN workers, and held EXACT position as R's do now.

That will improve both work experience and company outcomes.
2200 2018-10-31 19:08:44 In a world focused on making money, you would have to pay those who do good. Pay countries like Indonesia or Brazil for turning CO2 into O2 with their rain forests, like we pay other countries for oil.

2218 2018-10-31 19:07:33 @AlphLukau  how to get Holly salt and oil... ?
2219 2018-10-31 19:07:20 American oil production is at an all time high. Oil imports are at an all time low, and there’s something called renewable energy.

2230 2018-10-31 19:06:23 اقولكم شي ومعذرة التدخل !!! انتوا بنفسكم يا شعب لبنان تقرررو كيف واكيد بتعرفوا مين اللي بيخرب بلدكم ومين اللي جالس يستنزف اموالها ومين اللي جالس يدخل عليكم الحروب ومين اللي جالس يحط بينكم طوائف واعداء بكل صراحة #ايران وحزب الله
2231 2018-10-31 19:06:05 not trying to be rude buuuut if you blindly believe all the anti-1631 ads on tv about how bad it will be for everyone, you’re actually dumb as hell bc it literally lists all the oil companies paying for the campaign 

why would a giant oil company give a shit about you ??
2232 2018-10-31 19:06:05 Like I just put oil in my hair last night now it needs more. Being able to touch my scalp has been heavenly tho lowkey
2233 2018-10-31 19:05:54 I’m really erked asf like why is jiffy lube taking so fckn long doing a fckn oil change
2234 2018-10-31 19:05:48 protect us? like you protected syria and other countries in the middle east? LMAO. besides we don’t have any oil so the us doesn’t care. also, again, this conversation is about america. i have plenty of problems with russia and the eu, but that’s not relevant here.
2235 2018-10-31 19:05:41 250  to change a few sparks plugs and abit of oil 
2236 2018-10-31 19:05:22 I put in 2 mini splits. Much cheaper than oil. Better for the environment, I think.
2237 2018-10-31 19:05:16 These people pull over to film the rare white moose but they lost sight of is there a big oil tanker truck headed right at them on the wrong side of the road !!! How’d the video end ? Hopefully not tragically
2238 2018-10-31 19:05:13 Aku pernah pke sih, tpi sunflo sama rice bran. Emng bner jdi lbh cerah tpi jerawat makin bnyk. Klo kmu ccok pke oil"an dibeli aja
2239 2018-10-31 19:05:13 LOL. Tells you what you know about Venezuela. What makes you think they have open borders? And no, their taxes are not high. Their extensive social services were supported by oil revenues, when those collapsed so did the economy.
2240 2018-10-31 19:04:52 @SlateGist Oh Mike, Mike. (Fav greeting?) The hemp thing. Glossed over, no interest. Revealed, major importance! Hemp makes paper, cloth, plastics, fuel. Leave the trees. Oil stays underground. Re hippies, v low THC. Wind borne pollen v bad for pot quality. Educate self? Love!
2241 2018-10-31 19:04:49 I always look so homely. Yesterday I was covered in oil buying food haha I didn’t even realize it until this dude was asking if I had a rough day. Lol
2242 2018-10-31 19:04:40 Here's the dirty secret of HMD hygiene...most of it is theater and not actual effective anti-microbial practice.
However, a small dab of alcohol helps dry the sweat and emulsifies the skin oil a bit to make it cleaner. Wipes I think are worse.  Would love to have a better sol'n
2243 2018-10-31 19:04:35 Dear trick or treaters, accosting me as I get out of my car will not get you treats, nor money. The most I will have on me is an empty travel mug, some random bits of coated steel, a few sample bags and a USB-C cable. Oh and tonight, some chicken fillets and olive oil. Piss off.
2244 2018-10-31 19:04:34 This is the biggest Bullshit Story I’ve heard in a while. The whole Olympics Sales Pitch reminds me of a Snake Oil or used Car Salesman .
2245 2018-10-31 19:04:25 What techniques do you think are the best to trade oil?!
2246 2018-10-31 19:04:14 If we want to stop blowing things up, we solve the energy problem.  That is what my engine can do.  Get the oil out to a level that each country has enough to run their stuff.  95% possible.  5% is oil back up.  No taxes needed.  Just me and 3-4 engineers.  Works across economy.
2247 2018-10-31 19:04:10 Check the crude oil prices globally. It’s price is driven from outside s we don’t extract enough. Be logical
2248 2018-10-31 19:03:54 I might be wrong but it seems like Zoe is making a reference to the SFA content in foods people who are not dead eat. 

Perhaps some vegans avoid most foods with SFA (incl. pure poisons like coconut oil), but many vegans still eat olives, nuts, seeds etc.
2249 2018-10-31 19:03:46 @alisoneroman Probably (definitely) a stupid question for you: You say in Dining In we can sub Panko for Breadcrumbs BUT if I want to replace Panko for the rest of my life do I just do fresh Breadcrumbs, oil and salt?
2250 2018-10-31 19:03:34 I was told gold is irrelevant. 

In all seriousness, why would the US care if the deals were getting done at COMEX/NYMEX gold oil ratio?  Market would absorb it without issue
2251 2018-10-31 19:03:32 CRUDE OIL is lower again, WTI is now traded at 65.20 USD per barrel. Also GOLD moved lower, deleted 90 PIPS and landed at 1,213 USD per Tr.oz.
2252 2018-10-31 19:03:25 Just two tablespoons of castor oil get me camping in the toilet, wondering why i made such a horrible decision. Now imagine half a bottle.. yhuu
2253 2018-10-31 19:03:21 Just taking a quick soak in crude oil for my Venom costume tonight 
2254 2018-10-31 19:03:21 Sounds desperate to me, ANGS still cheap compared to UKOG imo.

2257 2018-10-31 19:03:01 I've attended a few courses at the same institution so I get your point. However, NNPC's "professionalism" is dictated by those at the top. Plus, given the "remarkable" growth of Duke Oil ovrr the years and elections around the corner, it may be a very short step indeed.
2258 2018-10-31 19:02:59 October 31, 1978:
30,000 Iranian oil workers go on strike against the brutally repressive rule of the U.S.-installed Shah.
2259 2018-10-31 19:02:57 What I meant was we wouldn’t want crude oil price to fall like it did recently. OPEC was unable to stabilize it on time and suffered

2261 2018-10-31 19:02:28 I read the book. It was kinda meh. Really, he turns them into essential oil, then turns that into perfume. He really didn't need to kill anyone to do it, but he didn't have the social skills to convince a teenage girl to let him slather her in oil cuz she smells good.
2262 2018-10-31 19:02:25 In Grand Theft Auto VI, they're literally going to kill developers by working them to death so that you're required to change the oil in the cars you steal.

2265 2018-10-31 19:01:55 Hmm ... OK OK ...make sense. A & M has oil and the others have other means. I get you
2266 2018-10-31 19:01:45 It’s all about oil... Iran’s oil.
2267 2018-10-31 19:01:43 ですな！
2268 2018-10-31 19:01:31 U.S. oil benchmark falls for the session, loses nearly 11% for the month
2269 2018-10-31 19:01:19 Use tea tree oil as well. The breakout will dry off in no time
2270 2018-10-31 19:01:13 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks.
2271 2018-10-31 19:01:07 Yes. Part of the lingering chicken soup/motivational speaker bullshit that crawled from the corpse of exegesis and still makes money for earnest sounding snake oil merchants.

2273 2018-10-31 19:00:57 Our ban on palm oil has meant there is nothing ‘nice’ for trick treating kids . Tried to impress with organic apple. I fear for our windows!
2274 2018-10-31 19:00:54 I don't know if the oil you showed is good for that, but if you can find the pens, rechargeable of course, then I'd recommend.

2295 2018-10-31 18:57:41 I believe it’s different with Turkey, whilst Barzani sent Peshmerga to Kobane, KRG is an autonomous entity thus relies on its neighbours for trade and especially turkey for its oil sales.if fought against turkey, it result in Turkish invasion of bashur in which cannot be afforded

2297 2018-10-31 18:57:32 I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, "Oh my God"
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
2298 2018-10-31 18:57:04 They’d have to run out of oil and $
2299 2018-10-31 18:56:54 1:25 CBD oil coming soon ???
2300 2018-10-31 18:56:51 Don’t buy it. Salmon fisheries is also a business. So is tourism. People don’t come here to see oil spills, oil platforms, clear cuts, and you sure as hell don’t put a mine in Bristol Bay. Get out of here with that corporate greed. #akelect #akgov
2301 2018-10-31 18:56:33 I-pace buyers are due for a very rude awakening because the I-pace looses half its charge in cold weather are half as efficient as the Tesla M3 and I-pace owners will pay more per mile for electric charging fees than gas cars pay due to Big Oil buying up charging companies.

2304 2018-10-31 18:56:06 I worked late to avoid them, as I was getting out of the car I was accosted by some. Like sure I went to Tesco and have some chicken fillets and olive oil, what do you expect as I'm getting out of the car?!
2305 2018-10-31 18:56:06 If ididnt work Heid you wouldn't have bashers on LSE day and night. So yes I think you can.

2311 2018-10-31 18:55:16 Mine was disposable, the battery died after about a month, it still had oil in it. Pretty good value.
2312 2018-10-31 18:55:14 Current price is not more than what it was on 25th July while oil prices and rate of $ has increased.
2313 2018-10-31 18:55:13 Yeah I learned last month . 45 degree angle only . Especially with shoulder press or you can damage your ACL. Can advise you more soon and also arm/oil wrestle
2314 2018-10-31 18:55:07 is that olive oil and butter? God
2315 2018-10-31 18:55:06 Hear hear. I don’t go too OTT when we get a good result. It’s all progression if you think back 12 months. Like steering an oil tanker. Plenty to be positive about. #nffc #coyr
2316 2018-10-31 18:54:56 Come on carnival cruises, it’s not like you haven’t HEARD by now how toxic fuel oil is invest in cleaner energy & u may get international contracts.Would $$ help you clean up???
2317 2018-10-31 18:54:55 Actually, no. If you’d stop paying attention to only US media (which Fox News is) you’d learn so much, sweetie. See, Venezuelans were actually doing very well under their socialist government until the US & Saudi Arabia did their little economic war against Venezuela because oil
2318 2018-10-31 18:54:52 that is like an oil CEO saying electric cars are not in the future
2319 2018-10-31 18:54:47 Oil
2320 2018-10-31 18:54:46 So gross  Unfortunately big oil has a ton of supporters here so I wouldn’t be surprised if it passes 
2321 2018-10-31 18:54:44 what could possibly go wrong if someone drank half a bottle of castor oil?

2327 2018-10-31 18:54:01 Walls have absolutely nothing to do with the 14th Amendment. 

Besides that, you could dig a moat around the border, fill it with oil and set it on fire - it's still not going to stop millions of migrants from entering legally to have their baby here.

2. Douse with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic, onion powder, cracked sea salt (NOT), black pepper 
3. In the oven at like fan 180ish for 25mins or so
2332 2018-10-31 18:52:57 They’re good too. Just a little expensive . Tea tree oil is good as well.
2333 2018-10-31 18:52:57 Yes! Awesome. Coconut oil, raw, organic, is anti bacterial, anti viral. Lauric acid in CO is anti microbial. Honey also anti, lots. They use Manuka honey, high UMF # ones in heart surgery. Higher than 10 UMF # is best. ACV rocks so much. Triple whammy. Foods, best meds for all!
2334 2018-10-31 18:52:52 Sry I said oil I mean any organic combustion... Natural gas and coal included.
2335 2018-10-31 18:52:51 Cheapest place to get a oil change?
2336 2018-10-31 18:52:30 I lost all respect for the man when drank “fracking fluid” on tv to show how safe it was. What he consumed was only one component of fracking fluid. Kissed up to big oil and misled the people of Colorado. 
2337 2018-10-31 18:52:03 You want maternity care, BUY IT!!!
I have no need of it, so why should I be required to purchase it? 
Should every person regardless of whether they drive or not be required to purchase auto insurance just so the price for those that do drive is lower? NO.
2338 2018-10-31 18:51:58 Yeh has only been a week but each day gets better. Have butter and coconut oil 3 times a day in coffee or coco. Saturated fat is not the bad guy, makes so many neurosteroids and anti inflammatories. 

Lol thanks  the crabman appreciates it
2339 2018-10-31 18:51:49 Coconut oil on steamed veggies taste just like if they were smothered with butter. 
2340 2018-10-31 18:51:46 At peak production most grids fall back on oil. That's why people who charge at home are encouraged to have some capacity (battery) so charging doesn't effect peak load. Unfortunately this additional battery cycle furthers the inefficiency...

2344 2018-10-31 18:50:57 Crude oil prices are flat at US$66.10/b and we expect it to meander around this level for a week or so and then start another decline to below US$60/b.

2348 2018-10-31 18:50:05 My car was horribly low on transmission fluid and oil but still ran like there was nothing wrong with it. @Kia what kinda cars you making out here? Super reliable.
2349 2018-10-31 18:50:03 I had thoughts of going out with my friends but now i just want to burn some sage and take a snake oil bath. Why be like everyone else and feel forced to do shit
2350 2018-10-31 18:50:03 Apart from wind and solar being cheaper than coal, oil and gas generation you make a good point.
2351 2018-10-31 18:49:56 I agree.  "oil and gas industry can, and should, stay in and help build Canadian economy" so let's build Energy East pipeline and forget the politics.

2354 2018-10-31 18:49:34 Turkey buys half of oil & Gas from Iran.. So what are we supposed to do - shut down the country or freeze to death during Winter because neocon Zionists are playing whose dick is bigger contest with the Mullas??

We go chop oil money Las Las
2359 2018-10-31 18:48:56 No not a bot — Rachel Notley hated the Oil patch - she has only recently supported them. Her very first speech as Premier was “I will shut down & clean up the tar sands” Google it it’s all there.
2360 2018-10-31 18:48:54 Unless the combo actually makes $CHK far more viable and profitable, right? Of course, oil/gas markets need behave...
2361 2018-10-31 18:48:46 I fully expected the ups and downs in 2018, as much of his success on the tour came during a small window in 2017. A full year on tour for a kid his age has to be an eye-opener. 2019 & 2020 will tell us if he can become that guy but he certainly has the tools in the ol' toolbox.
2362 2018-10-31 18:48:43 I feel like this isn't my week.
 I missed an important lecture/tutorial
My hijab pin burst in class
My hand got burned by it oil.

What's next?
2363 2018-10-31 18:48:36 عيسى رمضان :فرص لامطار تكون رعدية من نهار الاحد تستمر متقطعة لعدة أيام وكمياتها متوسطة لغزيرة أحيانا
2364 2018-10-31 18:48:36 I want the oil of God to flow in me, through and through. here I ammmm, on bending knees. with arms stretched out crying Lord. not my will, but Your will. less of me, and more of You
2365 2018-10-31 18:48:26 my grandma puts SO MUCH oil and butter into EVERYTHING,, i want to cry
2366 2018-10-31 18:48:26 Maybe everything has to change, or maybe not. We won’t know until we change the one thing that has to change: oil companies must cease to exist.
2367 2018-10-31 18:48:19 Commodities that are volatile are gold, shares and oil bro!
2368 2018-10-31 18:48:07 I suffer from a brain injury caused by taking a fall & landing on my head. Coconut oil has re-wired my brain. Fewer dizzy spells, much clearer thinking. & I took the oil for appetite suppression - never believing it could do so much more.
2369 2018-10-31 18:48:03 He that loveth pleasure [shall be] a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.(KJV)Proverbs 21:17
2370 2018-10-31 18:47:57 I repeat what I said yesterday. Crude oil soon under 60$ , due to strong economy slowdown and recession fears. This will force the #fed doing some consideration #oil #oott
2371 2018-10-31 18:47:51 
2372 2018-10-31 18:47:37 Obviously. It doesn't even need oil, let's do this

2375 2018-10-31 18:47:23 Importing more low income people that utilize services from water/sewer, roads, schools, hospitals, LE, and general social services means more usage of the same limited resources. This can only result in higher taxation for those with the means to pay them.
2376 2018-10-31 18:47:16 Oil prices falling in international market by 15% this month & #OGRA is corrupt if it cant reduce diesel prices, to give relief to poor citizens of Pak, #pti must change crony crook chairmain md of ogra, if he cant do his job honestly
2377 2018-10-31 18:47:15 How dare you.                        I would like for the companies to remove sesame seed oil so I can partake...  (I understand the bowl issue).
2378 2018-10-31 18:47:14 Right. Blood thirsty. That's why we go to foreign lands and kill millions in the name of freedom but in actuality is to claim oil fields and opium.  Liberalism justifies innocent blood being spelled? Aisha ra the mother of the believers age, and Mary's is irrelevant.

2382 2018-10-31 18:46:42 North Sea oil gave UK and Norway a surplus of £.

Norway - created a sovereign wealth fund that still gives out £ today

UK - Thatcher did tax giveaways

Still doing the same now.

If you're not rich & voted tory - don't believe MSM and go &do a bit of research @commonslibrary
2383 2018-10-31 18:46:42 Aik chota sa tabqa awaam ki taangein utha ke chatt se laga raha hai. 

The government has increased petrol prices by Rs5 per litre, diesel prices by Rs6.37 per litre, light diesel by Rs6.48, kerosene oil by Rs3 per litre.
2384 2018-10-31 18:46:39 I’m guessing you’re a bot. But if you’re not, you should get out from under your rock. @RachelNotley has been a fierce defender of our oil and gas industry and a very persuasive and effective champion of pipelines.
2385 2018-10-31 18:46:32 lmaoooo  I mean oil/acrylic colors those are a whole new level

2387 2018-10-31 18:46:17 I was at an exhibition at Strawberry Hill House (Twickenham) today, and as a mega film/TV location buff I asked a guide as to what had been filmed there. Up popped the name David Walliams - jeez, you've been in more places than castor oil mate.
2388 2018-10-31 18:46:10 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*

2392 2018-10-31 18:45:50 Crude oil inventories again rose this week this time by 3.2Mb. Inventories are only 28.9Mb above last year, as of this week.
2393 2018-10-31 18:45:50 Some guys tried to charge me 120$ just for an oil change so I went down the street and I'm getting my oil change and state inspection for WAAAY less
2394 2018-10-31 18:45:50 We are at War economically,technologically and human atrocities at the hands of tyrants that control USA with oil and money while killing civilians in Yemen. Judgement is coming
2395 2018-10-31 18:45:44 What was the cash flow that increased in comparison with Arab and Oil money? In Wenger's last years, he didn't have the financial resources to compete; to argue otherwise is simply ignoring facts.
2396 2018-10-31 18:45:18 I wanna find out the location of the facility where Zuckboi and   the Dorsinator go to get their oil changed.
2397 2018-10-31 18:45:15 The one where John asks u to steal the cart of oil. There are attack dogs there
2398 2018-10-31 18:45:12 You are the one lying in state. 
She was right. No refineries exist in IMO, Abia and Anambra- 3 oil producing States. 
There is Gas reserve in Nsukka it's on an FG freeze. 
Was she not right on security?  Why can't we have in Kaduna what we had in Ekiti? 
To you Lives are nothing
2399 2018-10-31 18:45:09 Well there are many people around the globe who hate the English for very good reason but when your 'trusted' neighbour steals >£1trn of Scotland's Oil and then worst still LIES about it and then SUPPRESSES the info what do you expect.  Gratitude?

2407 2018-10-31 18:44:18 @ITNNewsUK you are making massive assumptuons about the cannabis oil story, showing someone smoking a joint is so WRONG. Cannabis oil contains a very tiny amount of THC the component which makes you high. It is hardly there at all. Cannabis oil IS NOT A CANNABIS JOINT!

2409 2018-10-31 18:44:09 They're trying to do that here in WA as well, except I think they're even more scared of us because we got oil/petrol companies trying to stop ours.
2410 2018-10-31 18:44:07 I'm buying it for daniel that has pimple ,u knw u are d one that sed dey do use the oil in the sachet for pimples so I recommended it n promised to get one for him

2418 2018-10-31 18:43:31 Yup, I haven't turned my ballot in yet though. This evening probably. There is so much wrangling of gas, oil and energy here right now.
2419 2018-10-31 18:43:18 Thank you, and I'm so glad @landolakesinc @LandOLakesKtchn has pulled their support of hom so I can keep buying their olive oil butter!
2420 2018-10-31 18:43:17 Can’t wait for the day these old, racist, dipshit politicians aren’t working anymore and people who actually care about people, and not money and oil, take over.
2421 2018-10-31 18:43:02 Its so so hot in my area my frozen coconut oil also melted today. That too full bottle

2430 2018-10-31 18:41:46 @BarackObama legacy was crushed in less than two years with President @realDonaldTrump. His policies were exposed to be nothing more than snake oil.  The only thing he can do is lash out and rally his Obamabots to shore up any support that may remain.  #WorstPresidentEver
2431 2018-10-31 18:41:43 i usually pay $20-$25 for an oil change there lol my dad used to be a mechanic, if he didnt trust firestone i wouldnt go

2476 2018-10-31 18:37:17 Most agree that is true, but it doesn't change the fact that not one engine manufacturer has approved its use. The oil companies also like to test the elevation boundaries too. Been found in Sioux Falls, SD and other lower elevation locations. They make a lot of money off of it.

6. In the preparation of meals should be used so-called cold-pressed oils, such as olive, sunflower and soybean oil. Why?
Because these oils are a great source of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the body.

2486 2018-10-31 18:36:40 Rachel is full of ..it. Desperate to dig herself deeper into and oil pit she lies about the benefits of the TMX. It's a backward move that will be a boon doggle no matter what she promises. The economics benefits are only her dream they will not be realized.

2490 2018-10-31 18:36:28 Tbf, I believe some of that also goes into soy oil for human consumption...

but it doesn’t really matter anymore

We should lock arms and block Smithfield market: disrupt London’s main meat supply. The environmental impact of meat is smtimg peeps need to know about. #govegan

2494 2018-10-31 18:36:22 Whoever thought of awarding Bashir an Honorarry Doctorate of peace and diplomacy is an enemy of South Sudan. He killed us, called us insects, made a deal to loot our oil in the name of peace and still got honored.
2495 2018-10-31 18:36:18 I try to take 10 deep breaths and close my eyes. Also taking a sniff of lavendar essential oil helps!!!

2497 2018-10-31 18:36:09 Salt’s good. Soy sauce I’d add carefully and sparingly because it can overpower the sesame oil flavor quickly
2498 2018-10-31 18:36:04 I personally think the narrative itself is so bloody stupid but it's kind of symptomatic of modern psychology.
Bitcoin isn't the problem. Oil isn't the problem. Methane gas from the meat ISN'T THE DAMN PROBLEM!

2532 2018-10-31 18:33:08 I agree with that completely. Car insurance doesn’t cover getting your oil changed or fixing a flat tire. Health insurance only covering things like cancer, heart surgery, etc makes more sense assuming health care and prescription costs drop drastically.
2533 2018-10-31 18:33:07 oh look... who could have guessed linda sarsour would latch onto this
2534 2018-10-31 18:33:02 Shipping already took off. I already sold my $ESEA and $EDRY shares for a nice profit. Now is the time to buy small oil companies again while they're getting bought up by larger ones.

2539 2018-10-31 18:32:55 Excellent infographic. I mix turmeric powder, with raw, organic, coconut oil and then add 10-20 drops of appropriate essential oil, or a mix. They use the coconut oil and turmeric on baby elephant ears at the sanctuaries in Africa. Very mustard yellowy colorful, but works!

2563 2018-10-31 18:30:06 @ToddGraves.  Partially Hydrogenated Seed oil is outlawed and banned in Europe. Please have your dipping containers imprinted with a warning on the side. Have a leading authority in the field educate you on this subject.

2566 2018-10-31 18:29:44 Do research! Find out exactly what oil you need and exactly how much it will cost with whatever company you go to. Then go in and if they try to play games you’ll know and be able to shut that shit down quick
2567 2018-10-31 18:29:42 Why not decreased crude oil consumption due to increase from other sources in their energy mix?
2568 2018-10-31 18:29:33 But the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver expedited the trend we were on in BC, to diversify our resource based economy. This might be just what Alberta needs to explore opportunities outside of oil & gas.

2625 2018-10-31 18:22:09 High key almost started crying cause my small conservative town has a VEGAN SUPERMARKET. Got vegan dog treats and cbd oil.
2626 2018-10-31 18:22:08 Do scalp massages with whatever oil you like 3 times a week
2627 2018-10-31 18:22:00 The dressing was like, a ginger salad dressing mixed with soy sauce and sesame oil and some sugar.
2628 2018-10-31 18:21:35 I need a oil change
2629 2018-10-31 18:21:34 Google kr lo Alee,International market mein oil prices lately kam hui hein ya zayada. This is exactly what PML N used to do,international market mein prices kam hoti thi,ye barha dyty thay to increase their earnings.
2630 2018-10-31 18:21:33 I love a moisturized black man. Take ALL of my avocado oil, King.
2631 2018-10-31 18:21:25 Did you know that Beto wants to abolish ice and have NO border wall and he
wants a $10 tax on a barrel  of oil. Do you want those 3 things? NO I do NOT.
2632 2018-10-31 18:21:22 Bahamas, Cancun an Toronto on my 2019 plate. No oil changes, tire rotation or servicing my car. Not even visiting family. Lmao

2634 2018-10-31 18:21:01 You obviously know nothing about the oil boom in the Midland area..... of course many people aren't there.
2635 2018-10-31 18:21:01 maybe he didn't  buy grocery.. cooking oil yahone ye yovha yo shelwa .
2636 2018-10-31 18:20:58 Obasanjo woman, Buharis government is corrupt bc of implementing TSA. He also refused to renew Obasanjo & Co oil well. He is corrupt,bc he paid pensioners  & their gratuity. He is corrupt bc of infrastructures.
2637 2018-10-31 18:20:54 As long as Saudia Arabia still has the oil and money, other countries will just pretend SA is getting "progressive". Perhaps the definition of progressive means arresting and killing more people than before.
2638 2018-10-31 18:20:53 Dudu Kweli Oil Chafu
2639 2018-10-31 18:20:47 Vape pen with 90% thc oil would be the option an opiate dependent person would find as a plausible alternative.

2643 2018-10-31 18:20:28 The US stole Oil from them and ruined there Country

2645 2018-10-31 18:20:12 Christ and Nazis go together like oil and water...
2646 2018-10-31 18:20:00 @Oil_Drop May surprise you but tennis reminds me a lot of pro boxing. Power is so important;, forcing opponent to move; counter-punching on returns. Stretching this analogy, I hope we find out that Shapo does not have the equivalent of a glass jaw.
2647 2018-10-31 18:19:37 and the essential oil bible chicks
2648 2018-10-31 18:19:32 ooops!!!

ps: let's pray harder for a turn around after 2:30 today
2649 2018-10-31 18:19:29 @AlbertaatNoon yes! especially given the political tension right now, people need a feeling of civic pride and camaraderie (and not everything is about oil and gas)
2650 2018-10-31 18:19:22 225,500 klics. for the metric minded. So, conola or extra virgin olive oil? #ElevenYearsOld #LooksOlder
2651 2018-10-31 18:19:17 Regarding the last statement.  It doesn't matter if oil is moved on Iranian tankers.
2652 2018-10-31 18:19:17 Congratulations to @JohnWEngland and the #DeloitteOilGas team on a great conference looking at where the #oil #gas #LNG industry is is going next.
2653 2018-10-31 18:19:17 If there were no wars over oil, drugs, corporate greed and division, there would be no migration issue. People generally want to stay where their family and friends reside, their home. They move due to lack of resources and their lives are in peril. Use funds to support not kill
2654 2018-10-31 18:18:59 I went for the Neck Oil chief
2655 2018-10-31 18:18:57 Deuteronomy 18:4 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

2657 2018-10-31 18:18:12 Big assumption.. We should never have gone to war on Iraq. Sold lies from the top. A war for oil
2658 2018-10-31 18:17:52 Get em off that..if there is a problem get them on all natural hemp oil...it works!!!

2660 2018-10-31 18:17:42 Obama -- the perfect marriage of snake oil salesman and carnival barker. The 21st century's premiere charlatan.
2661 2018-10-31 18:17:35 Play trading like a poker. 
Market plays a bluff many times in a day. You do the opposite. More than 50% you will make more. 
That’s all about probability. 
#crude #trading #oil #oott
2662 2018-10-31 18:17:11 I think the oil industry is more important to Canada than senators.  Oil and gas generate billions which do good for society.  We don’t need the senate anymore.
2663 2018-10-31 18:17:10 Koko is getting her first oil change 
2664 2018-10-31 18:16:56 Yes. But think of the consequence of surplus crude oil in the market. 2015 and the recession still fresh in our minds
2665 2018-10-31 18:16:52 lol..i understand people like u.
your economy depends on oil..

2666 2018-10-31 18:16:49 wow! looks like hedgies are bailing out of oil to close the month!
2667 2018-10-31 18:16:35 You use oil for cooking fried eggs and butter for scrambled eggs, no? #fourinabed

2674 2018-10-31 18:15:33 Yes, I was bitten once by a brown recluse, my method of emergency treatment with salicylic acid and tee tree oil was document by local health care professionals! 
2675 2018-10-31 18:15:29 That's fine. Blind faith is very harmful. A real debate needs to happen based on real issues. 5 years ago when petrol prices rose Modi blasted central govt. Now it's at all time high even when oil prices are down globally and Modi points fingers at others. It's a huge JOKE.
2676 2018-10-31 18:15:21 and bring you back safely, I love you rub me down with that lotion, baby oil me
2677 2018-10-31 18:15:18 Are y’all going to stop using coconut oil on your face in 2019? Let’s see
2678 2018-10-31 18:15:05 Some aspects right. Many misleading / not keeping with the times....
What about efforts by the present govt., to increase farm incomes, crop insurance, neem coated urea, soil health card, etc.
Pulses imports has more or less stopped. Govt also targeting edilble oil imports 1/n
2679 2018-10-31 18:14:47 I hate McDonalds. Their fries taste like powder and oil
2680 2018-10-31 18:14:42 The UK economy is built on arms, banking and oil - Nothing more and nothing less
2681 2018-10-31 18:14:41 I finally found my shade match in the born this way foundation. (Hazelnut)

2689 2018-10-31 18:13:39 Is the bottom left a warm skillet to melt the oil pastel?
2690 2018-10-31 18:13:30 Yes there is, it's called zero point energy. Nikola Tesla discovered it in the 1920's , and made gas coal and oil obsolete, the problem was the Rockefellers and the bankers would not let it happen, buried this tech, and enslaved the world to fossil fuels. Open your eyes, wake up.
2691 2018-10-31 18:13:29 I just got my Halloween surprise from my boss........
12 hour days starting tomorrow. It’s good money but I will be too tired to spend it.
2692 2018-10-31 18:13:25 Vaca Muerta se descubrió en 1926, fue el geólogo Charles Weaver contratado por Standart Oil (Hoy Chevron), para analizar formaciones geológicas en la cuenca patagónica.
El gobierno K no pudo ponerla operativa porque nadie le prestaba un centavo, por eso acuerdo con Chevron.
2693 2018-10-31 18:13:13 Leem about to do my brakes and oil change #perks
2694 2018-10-31 18:13:06 @fredykia @kia just found out your "free" oil changes for a year also requires you to pay for tire rotation? How is this free? Also if you just want the oil change it suddenly becomes something I have to pay for? Shame on you for false advertising. Next step is the BBB.

2699 2018-10-31 18:12:37 hi how do you put oil in a car asking for a friend
2700 2018-10-31 18:12:34 Manila clams and cabbage steamed with smoked ham. Combine together with fettuccine in olive oil.
2701 2018-10-31 18:12:17 SAA needs to go now to the east and recapture these areas and secure the oil fields - fuck the demarcation line, this is isis and they cannot be allowed to expand once again
2702 2018-10-31 18:12:09 If they don't do something with him, the expect to see oil derricks next to old faithful in less than two years
2703 2018-10-31 18:12:00 Do you know how many oil barrels we import every day?
2704 2018-10-31 18:11:39 Sanctions, yes.  Oil? We are producing more than enough for our own needs and they need our military hardware.  He did NOT condemn the man who ordered it.

2706 2018-10-31 18:10:52 What're you doing about it? Have you cut out electricity and stopped using oil?
2707 2018-10-31 18:10:43 Why do our government support the Saudis in Yemen, they have literally just murdered an America’s journalist. As if they would help us if we needed. Oil money Arabs
2708 2018-10-31 18:10:29 @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may too little too late for so many in the #YemenGenocide you are both a disgrace to your countries putting oil and weapons above lives!!
2709 2018-10-31 18:10:12 Forest Lucas is a POS isnt he?  Filthy rich Oil Baron making millions from destroying our land & our #wildhorses suffer for it. How much money does one person need ?  Our public lands,wild horses & burros are worth more than anything money can buy . They can't be replaced

2712 2018-10-31 18:09:54 @Oil_Drop Simple solution (maybe): Raonic's power is more than his own body can handle. Same issue has affected pitchers for many years in baseball -- the fireballer who strikes out everybody until forced to retire too young.
2713 2018-10-31 18:09:53 @AdamMancini4 go time oil
2714 2018-10-31 18:09:51 Pake baby oil. Sebelum tidur cuci kaki dulu, terus pakein baby oil keseluruh telapak kaki sambil dipijit. Terus pake kaus kaki dan kamu tidur. aku pernah kering begitu, aku rutinin semingguan kakiku lembut lagi '-'

2716 2018-10-31 18:09:19 Bannon is an excellent speaker, he thinks and talks clear. 
In my opinion he is selling snake oil but that's me. 
Unlike many 'activists' he has never suggested that members of a nation or an ethnic group should be silenced. 
He has not been caught breaking any US laws either.
2717 2018-10-31 18:09:14 Learn to do your own oil change so later in life you can teach your kids. Why not  
2718 2018-10-31 18:09:07 Shi'ite as much as I don't like them blocked the convoy of a general and they paid with their lives, while Berom terrorists conspired, killed a General in the most gruesome way, hid his car in a pond, buried him somewhere, met to exhume the corpse and re burry in a well.
2719 2018-10-31 18:08:46 Beard oil is to sooth the skin under the beard. Baby oil would do the same thing. 
Its not an itch, its the bearddy awesomeness shining through and you skin is thanking you!

2722 2018-10-31 18:08:30 Let me catch someone saying some dumb shit like this. Or “I have to wash my hair everyday” nah, you don’t. It gets extra oily bc you’ve been washing it too much&your body is creating more oil to keep up....my scalp&hair is so dry. I’m a once a weeker.
2723 2018-10-31 18:08:28 This guy needs capital to start his own business and a job. 
His expertise and education will be more valuable when he works for himself not someone.
2724 2018-10-31 18:08:23 castor oil and raspberry leaf tea!!!!
2725 2018-10-31 18:07:59 You are absolutely correct. We obviously fight for oil and bargaining chips. We also help people along the way perhaps it’s to make our image look good but at the end of the day we’re helping. We’ve held the tittle as world police but we’ve change our tactics as of
2726 2018-10-31 18:07:57 My pleasure Sir.

2739 2018-10-31 18:06:04 And what cost to workers and trickledown environmental damage. They drill for oil in the Midwest and oceans. Reflect on the disasters from harvesting these resources. Just because you can mine doesn’t mean you have to.  You can jump off a cliff...
2740 2018-10-31 18:06:00 Sir don't you think this is plan one side every body is talking about rizvi and 2nd side where govt increase oil price but nobody are talking about this???
2741 2018-10-31 18:05:59 Norway did not squander their oil  and gas revenues and did not let the oil companies take huge margins. They also held on to their fishing rights. Their economy is always well managed and they hire-in expertise from other European states to maximise revenues.
2742 2018-10-31 18:05:59 Expensive oil changes 
2743 2018-10-31 18:05:52 secondly otc fish oil costs anywhere from 10-20$ per bottle and contains dha that raises bad cholesterol. if a bottle has 100 capsules that’s like less than 10 days supply
2744 2018-10-31 18:05:50 it's funny how many pushback against oil and gas in Canada where we have the lowest emissions and cleanest standards.. but dont say a word about countries that are heavy polluters and have horrible standards of living
2745 2018-10-31 18:05:48 Yeah,God have willed Niger Delta oil money to them

2756 2018-10-31 18:03:44 Batteries?  U are going to power an industrial economy of 330 million people on batteries?. Beyond the fact that solar cell efficiency is not great to begin with u have the fact that batteries have a finite storage capacity.  Nuclear, natural gas, and oil are realistic.
2757 2018-10-31 18:03:40 what is that..retweet lol and eating 60 caps of weed oil in two months or less has a 92 percent cure cancer rate

weed oil eaten destroys cancer cells
run from the cure - reference - rick simpson
2758 2018-10-31 18:03:35 I think that comparison and analysis is wrong: For example; if u buy any OTC fish oil from Amazon or pharmacy check out their prices and dose for epa/dha. you have to consume likely anywhere from 10-15 capsules single dose of OTC to equal one dose 4gm of amarin.
2759 2018-10-31 18:03:29 Ah palm oil
2760 2018-10-31 18:03:26 Don't get fed up! Seek to know. Or best get someone who knows to walk you through. You can get THE job. You need strength, consistency and perseverance as a fuel. So get yourself up and decide that "we die here" . Then you're good to go. Maybe someday I'll do a thread on this.

2764 2018-10-31 18:02:40 America has; invaded multiple nations to steal OIL, used the military as mercenaries, overthrown governments, installed dictators, supported oppressive regimes, financed revolutions & murdered civilians! Who will sanction America? #Egypt #Chile #Panama #Turkey #Venezuela #Iraq
2765 2018-10-31 18:02:38 Would you lump coconut oil in with the other vegetable oils even though is contains almost no PUFA?
2766 2018-10-31 18:02:34 that's b/c big oil corps have but 12 million into the fight against prop 1 so they don't have to bother with protecting salmon habitat.

2777 2018-10-31 18:01:09 With 2:1 you can only get more through graduate Trainee . The pay is always higher through the right process. Banks, audits, oil and energy company also some IT too. But with less experience you might not get more.

2780 2018-10-31 18:00:58 I quite understand your plight. But always know that NOTHING is difficult in itself. You just may lack understanding and skill in that area. A plane looks so difficult to you and I but it's an easy walk for a pilot. Job searching is an easy walk for me. I know my way.
2781 2018-10-31 18:00:56 We are saying different things. By voting against the proposal that would throw out the oil tax, he is therefore in favor of the tax. It’s not that hard
2782 2018-10-31 18:00:55 Optics ruling today.  Data will rule tomorrow.  Oil, copper and fx suggest significant erosion.
2783 2018-10-31 18:00:49 They have moved on kaya pala hanggang ngayon naghahabol pa si Marcos. And talking about blaming previous admin, Du30 blames delawan & others for his incompetence. Blamed US or Trump for ailing economy, blamed oil prices for inflation, even blamed beautiful women for rape.

2797 2018-10-31 17:59:35 World is short of clean water. We can convert to alt fuels right now,have been able many decades but oil is money.

2804 2018-10-31 17:58:52 I remember when you first picked it up and was saying that you were one of those people that horde supplies and are going to stockpile oil for the light.... It never lasted. It being annual now I am sure you've improved greatly. No?

2806 2018-10-31 17:58:41 Can you give any sources as to the benefit of argan oil? I tried to research beard oil recently and what I found was that everything was marketing... If there is any real evidence based reason to use argan oil, I will follow your advice asap!

2811 2018-10-31 17:58:07 I’m at Bobs right now! He does my inspections every year and my oil changes when zeke doesn’t have time
2812 2018-10-31 17:57:58 Oil long seems like fat pitch to me here.  1) hedge funds out 2) maintenance season done 3) product draws super strong 4) Iran coming out 5) bullish on demark.  $uso $uco #OOTT
2813 2018-10-31 17:57:51 seminggu sudah ngolesin coconut oil di muka setiap hari sebelum tidur. hasilnya? lebih glowing, asli! remember that I only talk to myself: apa yg cocok di gue, belom tentu cocok di elu. sekian.
2814 2018-10-31 17:57:37 It reduces my anxiety, better quality of sleep and more energy through out the day. Have you tried CBD oil before?
2815 2018-10-31 17:57:28 So the discount from the WTI benchmark that heavy oil in northern Alberta is getting is a combination of the discount associated with grade and the transport costs. You can't do anything about grade but you can lower transport costs. 5/
2816 2018-10-31 17:57:20 Natural changes are huge problems. But sometimes, us humans are doing even more damage then the Earth.

We have killed many animals and plants by destroying them and their habitats. 

We are making Earth warmer by burning fossil fuel, coal, oil and gas (global warming).
2817 2018-10-31 17:57:10 To me the biggest part of teaching someone to cook is making sure they understand spices outside of salt exist. Like it is perfectly fine to season root vegetables for roasting with curry powder, not olive oil and salt and pepper.
2818 2018-10-31 17:57:09 Conversion Therapy should be against the law.

The American Psychological Association is against this kind of treatment. Being LGBTQ is NOT a mental illness. 

This 2018 people. Don’t let someone sell you snake oil cure all’s. This is not about love or help, it is torture.
2819 2018-10-31 17:56:59 Done.
2820 2018-10-31 17:56:58 7の時点で…これ以上は言ったら心痛くなるから辞めますwww
2821 2018-10-31 17:56:39 like yeah a carbon tax would make gas prices higher but so why dont the american ppl switch to more fuel efficient cars&dont let the oil industry win. if prices get higher we shouldn’t eliminate the tax just switch to electric cars or vote in local elections to expand bike paths
2822 2018-10-31 17:56:32 Coconut oil is so healthy and universal.  You can use it almost in everything.  You know it .
I'm using it even on my face and my curls.  
Remember only extra virgin bio coconut  oil.
2823 2018-10-31 17:56:31 Idk how I let the dealership con me into paying for a service plan. Then have my ass at the dealership for 2+ hours. I can change my own fucking oil in 10 minutes.
2824 2018-10-31 17:56:26 The Nissan dealership sent me a free oil change coupon for my bday which was really nice except I bought an electric car from them LOL
2825 2018-10-31 17:56:20 If amendment 74 gets passed then there will probably never be another oil lease approved, due to the financial risk. It really is a nuclear option.
2826 2018-10-31 17:56:17 Asked my gp for cbd oil,only for certain severe cases was the answer though that may change in future,hope so as its costing me a fortune to stop nausea and stomach cramps.dumb uk law.

2835 2018-10-31 17:55:09 All the Oregon money is for Pac/West to run the oil and gas industry campaigns.
2836 2018-10-31 17:55:08 No. One of the quickest ways to give yourself a heart attack or stroke is to eat tons of high omega 6 oils (like corn oil) every day with lots of sugar for a few months straight (like McDonald’s French fries and sugary drinks). Do NOT do this!
2837 2018-10-31 17:55:00 Is that a manufacturers label on the front. Solid fuel? Not Oil?

2845 2018-10-31 17:53:59 It's a little dark for those with poor eyesight. But an overall good design.
2846 2018-10-31 17:53:56 If everything is properly organized, migration can bring great profits. In Russia, from the sale of licenses to work income is already more than the taxes of oil companies. But this is only if the migration is legal
2847 2018-10-31 17:53:53 Hattie, have you ever tried CBD oil ?
2848 2018-10-31 17:53:51 'Beard oil' is pretty much hair growth oil, repackaged and sold at a higher price for #beardgang
2849 2018-10-31 17:53:45 The best! (with sea salt and olive oil of course)
2850 2018-10-31 17:53:42 The Nagpur Municipal Corporation standing committee on Wednesday approved procurement of 24,000 litres mosquito larvicidal oil (MLO) at the cost of Rs41.28 lakh. It will be sprayed on waterlogged spots, stagnant water in and around residences to control vector-borne diseases.

2860 2018-10-31 17:51:52 It's not optimism, it's common snake oil salseman tactics. He has a business and he has to lure you with promises.  People are forced to do this when their only commodity is opinion.

The Shah used his constitutional power to dismiss him.

2875 2018-10-31 17:50:10 What does the businessman holding the cash mean, that's right? That's the military captain selling out to the interests of Big Oil. That war didn't do shit against U.S Terrorism.
2876 2018-10-31 17:50:07 @CNNPolitics I guess they have to use "advocates" when the "sources" dry up.

2878 2018-10-31 17:49:53 Instead of correcting a market failure by internalizing the costs of pollution, 74 gives the oil and gas industry the right to pollute?! This is not capitalism.

2884 2018-10-31 17:49:17 With reference to refining, lighter crudes- like the shale oil from the Dakotas -yield higher cuts; primarily transport fuels.

2890 2018-10-31 17:48:51 2/2 I like how McTeague always puts things in perspective & sets record straight, i.e. who should get credit 4 what. "If global consumption & demand for oil remains as robust as it is, we’re going to get walloped and be back to the $1.40 (a litre) by the summer,” said McTeague.
2891 2018-10-31 17:48:45 His wife and his father probably love money as much as Ted does so maybe they don't care. Leadership for profit and Democracy -- oil and water. Ted needs to go.

2897 2018-10-31 17:47:38 This is for fresh food stocks. Grain and processed goods may be stockpiled for a few weeks worth. But the UK lacks these storage facilities, the population has increased since WW2. There are about 90 days of oil stocks and 2 years worth of nuclear fuel.

2909 2018-10-31 17:46:31 I mean, you could but it'd be a hella effort and really expensive. The dilbit is a heavy oil there is big demand for it. In fact, there are lots of refineries all over the world that specifically designed for heavy oil and they can not process lighter crudes. 2/

2923 2018-10-31 17:44:25 With respect, I think you're get a couple concepts mixed up here. Specifically, grade & refining. The bitumen in northern Alberta is upgraded to create dilbit which is a heavy oil. Upgrading is not refining and you can't turn bitumen into West Texas Intermediate. 1/

It does not produce them for humans does it?  Have we already removed too many internal organs? Are we killing Earth?
2958 2018-10-31 17:39:59 Great. I already subsidize drivers’ roads, parking, and oil, even though I can’t get a protected bike lane or BRT to save my life (literally). Now I also get to subsidize their electrons?

The early modernists (arts and crafts say) wanted to keep everyman, everyday qulities high.
2969 2018-10-31 17:38:07 But the sanctions effectively reduce the output on oil because the financial sanctions don't allow the import of anything else.  If they need to buy replacement parts then the sanctions stop that transaction and the result is lower output due to a well shutdown.

China is Iraq's largest foreign oil buyer with state energy companies like PetroChina, CNOOC & Sinopec Group owning more than 20-30 percent of Iraq oil projects. Most oil holdings were purchased during 2009 energy auctions. So why South America?

3030 2018-10-31 17:30:23 If you say they're an eyesore or you think if the fans go counterclockwise they are sucking your electricity, or you think they make you sick... That's false propaganda. I love wind farms. I love solar farms. Oil refineries on the other hand I am not a fan of
3031 2018-10-31 17:30:21 Things overheard in the office today:

*scoffs* "Palm oil."

"I'm going to whole foods later to get a big thing of coconut milk so we can have Mexican hot chocolate."

"You better vote. Suffragettes died for your right to vote."
3032 2018-10-31 17:30:19 Petroli adimu Zanzibar. Foleni petrol stations kama foleni ya Ubungo. I wonder why? More importantly why can't oil from Dar save the day? Its hardly 80 kilometers...
3033 2018-10-31 17:30:13 Democrats are for open boarders, illegals voting, repealing trumps changes,  repealing your tax increase, socialism, mob rule, higher taxes, ruining the economy, stopping the coal, steel, and oil companies. Could go on and on but I think you get the point!
3034 2018-10-31 17:30:07 OIL SPILL // POSS 3 GALLONS
3035 2018-10-31 17:30:07 Threat of a forceful Iranian response to the US embargo on its oil sales, which goes into effect on Nov. 5
3036 2018-10-31 17:30:02 I've been thinking about a Moral Carbon Tax. It would work like this: foreign policy that lives your principles, with the known side effect of raising the price of oil. It would also be a market based way of encouraging investments in alternatives. Also inherently global.
3037 2018-10-31 17:30:00 With over 64 ton diesel, handed over from PetroChina to a Lao company at 2Laos-China border, the first export of Chinese refined oil to Lao market was made on Wednesday.

3040 2018-10-31 17:29:36 Shea Moisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Leave-in Treatment is my personal favorite. Also, I mix some Jamaican black castor oil with equal parts rosehip oil and give myself a scalp massage every night before bed. It has helped me reduce my postpartum hair loss and  regrow, too
3041 2018-10-31 17:29:34 Yes, I do the little bit of frying/sautéeing I do in a little butter & olive oil, I don’t like things “swimming” in fat  #fourinabed
3042 2018-10-31 17:29:33 Thats not inherent in either system. Venezuela destroyed plenty of its environment because their system relied on the influx of oil money.
In capitalism the black numbers rule the world. So, if you can show the most black numbers come from preservation, it will move towards that
3043 2018-10-31 17:29:29 i meant snake oil metaphorically but like. yeah basically. jdjdndbdbdh
3044 2018-10-31 17:29:26 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
3045 2018-10-31 17:29:12 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
3046 2018-10-31 17:28:26 Outright lie.  Oil industry should be embarrassed.  The established pipeline has nothing to do with protecting salmon spawning habitat!  Vote yes on #1 and protect Alaska's vital renewable resource.

3048 2018-10-31 17:28:22 Listed names for sales when job hunting -

A while ago I saw a thread about what reps prefer to call themselves so that they don't give off the snake oil salesman vibe. As a follow up on this, I was wondering what kind of names, when listing vacancies on job searching websit…
3049 2018-10-31 17:28:20 Raw sugar cane and coconut oil mixture, it work soooooo good, you feel a difference in your within a few days and I also use organic soaps that I order from @spliffsNpotions ....

3061 2018-10-31 17:26:53 I spent 10 minutes wondering why my oil wasn’t heating up in the frying pan, only to realise I didn’t turn the oven on at the wall. Someone put me down!

3072 2018-10-31 17:25:28 #Religious fanatics close to nuclear bombs in backward Pakistan,Dark ages Saudi Arabia being allowed too much say in the world just because of oil.
And we have the audacity to preach morals.
I would say Heven help us but I think God would say you've made your bed,on you bike!
3073 2018-10-31 17:25:26 So, like, do unions have an inventory of oil drums at the ready for picket-line barrel fires, or do they have to source them every time? (Kinda serious question)
3074 2018-10-31 17:25:04 It’s honestly more stress than I can handle most days.   That and getting the car strattled over that damn pit at the oil change place.   Don’t worry guy trying to help with hand gestures, I’ll breathe again when this is over

3091 2018-10-31 17:23:21 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to the Boston Redsox. I'll get a good price!
3092 2018-10-31 17:23:19 My family is full of farmers and oil field workers. My parents always wanted me to be different, so I’m changing the norm! I’ll be the first Doctor in our family! Can’t let them down

3157 2018-10-31 17:16:12 NATO hidden pages. Where is oil, gaz, golden, natural resources, you find the Precious NATO rocketing, throwing beautiful bombs, multicolored chemical weapons.

3161 2018-10-31 17:15:51 Does it pay enough to cover expenses for you car, ie. gas, oil change, tires, etc.?
3162 2018-10-31 17:15:39 Tonight is actually @KockelU's third inaugural lecture - quite an achievement considering he started in the oil industry!

3163 2018-10-31 17:15:32 Prob oils or capsules would be my vote. But the oil will give you the most control over your dosage it seems? Easier to adjust if you find you need more or less.

3172 2018-10-31 17:13:43 You just said that America is the world's richest country. That is a lie. To divert that you talk about oil flow and US dollars
3173 2018-10-31 17:13:38 Hmm... £30bn is now a side issue? Is that because there's no credible evidence that Indy Scotland would suddenly get this oil taxation revenue? So can you identify the WM overspending in Scotland?
3174 2018-10-31 17:13:34 We use groundnut oil . Mustard oil is ganda. It smell ewww 
3175 2018-10-31 17:13:29 Yet the EU will close their eyes to state sponsored murder.

3178 2018-10-31 17:13:10 They would have to adopt socialism, nationalize oil, and denounce Israel.
3179 2018-10-31 17:13:06 Tea tree oil might be too strong and dry out your scalp? Anything I’ve ever tried out with tea tree oil has stung my skin and I don’t have sensitive skin.
3180 2018-10-31 17:13:03 We only eat candy made with sustainable palm oil this Halloween!
3181 2018-10-31 17:12:57 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
3182 2018-10-31 17:12:50 Curious aspect of #Saudi Q3 budget outturn is fall in #oil revenue to SR154bn from SR184bn in Q2: Saudi prod averaged 10.4m b/d in Q3 vs 10.2m b/d in Q2, while OPEC price was $76/b vs $68/b (roughly). Higher domestic demand (air con)? Accounting discrepancy?
3183 2018-10-31 17:12:48 Big $$ from corporations with vested interests like big oil/big pharma - but you that
3184 2018-10-31 17:12:41 This might happen often when a GM is questioned. Could have gone, "Peter, what's with Kassian being a healthy scratch? Is this to get him going or are you worried he's not a fit?" Chiarelli response: "We like him but he can explore his options." Not like Oil can't use the space.

3187 2018-10-31 17:12:06 I see that there is an economic dictum playing out. USA hadn't produced from its own crude oil reserves ever and even has started to export it. The graph of reserves against growing population now slopes downwards. That's why they want to decide who belongs and who doesn't.
3188 2018-10-31 17:11:57 I feel like oil is honestly the best bet. Instead of getting one big bottle of either you could get a small bottle of each to test out what works best for you.
3189 2018-10-31 17:11:39 Trying out a new beard oil tonight.
3190 2018-10-31 17:11:32 Why is it, that every beautiful place on earth happens to sit on a mineral or oil deposit? Is it a lesson to learn to choose wisely? #PeopleOverProfit #ClimateAction #ClimateJustice #RightToConsultation
3191 2018-10-31 17:11:25 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
3192 2018-10-31 17:11:20 Coconut oil is too greasy but great on the body especially in the area that you’ve had radiation treatment. It’s super important to pay extra attention with radiation areas...bruising and burned skin can pop up quickly!
3193 2018-10-31 17:11:17 All this speculation is stupid it is what it is. This was a professional hit on a journalist by a Brutal Saudi Regime that has been doing it for decades.Every US admins.(reps & dems)have been complicit to their Human rights violations and have turned a blind eye. follow the oil.
3194 2018-10-31 17:11:07 So, we let members of the #akleg who work for oil companies vote on oil taxes. That is a conflict of interest. No one seems to care about that!
3195 2018-10-31 17:11:02 my mom sent me a text that said “evoo” and i asked what it meant and she said “extra virgin olive oil” like tf first of all how am i supposed to know that and second why are you shortening that
3196 2018-10-31 17:10:58 It is an incontrovertible fact that the Buhari administration has done more with less in three and half years than the sixteen year PDP misrule where the country earned $862 billion from oil alone.

3213 2018-10-31 17:08:56 You don’t get it. The debt is how we create money. Paying it back is not an option. It’s a terrible part of having the world’s reserve currency. Even worse we export oil which brings more USD home. And it’s not being early. It’s living through it.
3214 2018-10-31 17:08:56 the oil change guy just scolded me for going 2,000 miles over... im not ready to be an adult yet

3222 2018-10-31 17:08:39 Crushing Russia and stealing it's oil was the goal. It was working nicely until that evil Putin came in and threw a wrench in the works.
3223 2018-10-31 17:08:37 @Oil_Drop A few years ago, Pospisil showed big promise, too, but injuries interrupted. When Raonic survived on Tuesday, he seemed to be nursing another injury. Tennis Canada has done a good job of developing top-10 talent, but keeping them healthy -- that's different.
3224 2018-10-31 17:08:32 Unless they continued to do nothing about climate change while taking money from oil and gas. People are responding to how the Democrats act. Not how they say they will act.

Thoughts on Apple Cider Vinegar?(using it as a salad dressing with avocado oil, or just drinking 2-4tbs)

Thoughts on Greek Yogurt? (Plain as a breakfast side dish to eggs or as a sour cream substitute?)
3229 2018-10-31 17:07:16 Forgot to say: consume the organic, cold pressed product, undiluted. You can tell it's been diluted with olive or some other oil after trying the real goods- it tastes/feels medicinal; the diluted kinds aren't as strong, nor do they have that beautiful deep brown amber colour.

3235 2018-10-31 17:06:43 This week:

3236 2018-10-31 17:06:40 Total clown stuff. In other words garbage. First tell the "doctor" either use "Dr.", or the the preferred "D.C." To use both shows a low class idiot running a con. The urine enhancement, money grubbing, snake oil, is another disgrace.

3244 2018-10-31 17:06:13 I want our oil to be transported safely, that’s why I support new pipe lines. But after the Dakota Access pipeline protests followed by the spilling of oil from that very  Dakota pipeline, I understand the severe lack of trust in those who get these projects moved forward.

3301 2018-10-31 16:58:51 From what I experienced with vapor, you will have to learn your dosage as you go. I'm not sure how it'll taste but the oil will probably be more efficient in determining how much you actually need.

3304 2018-10-31 16:58:36 This by far is one of the strangest chart interpretations I have seen. $SLB and the entire oil service industry has been in a depression for 10 years and so their stocks have been trying to bottom for that period. TOP?  WTF?

3307 2018-10-31 16:58:01 im wondering now Venezuela gave up their freedom and large oil supply  to the commies without a shot fired and now Venezuelans sit in shit and don't fight to get back freedom but flea when will trump blow up the commie government in Venezuela to stop the commie oil supply
3308 2018-10-31 16:57:56 @KQEDForum I’ve never heard anybody so defensive, you never called him a spokes person for that oil company, and he thinks “lock her up” was a joke? Go away
3309 2018-10-31 16:57:55 I took my car in today for JUST an oil change and they just called to tell me I need a new air filter, and new brakes and rotors. Happy Halloween to my bank account all tricks this year 
3310 2018-10-31 16:57:51 My hair oil is going up next week. Trying to give my peeps a deal b4 the price increases. Its going worldwide and u can only get it online starting next week.
3311 2018-10-31 16:57:49 Honestly, don't see retirement as an option any time soon but perhaps taking close to full year off to rebuild his body, just like the big boys, is realistic. Of course the difference w/ Milos is he doesnt have near the mileage on him & yet he continually breaks down.

3314 2018-10-31 16:57:10 I did oil paintings of a few of my friends and the fact they were weirded out was palpable behind politeness when I showed them. I should’ve asked, definitely
3315 2018-10-31 16:57:08 Got my own gun!!!, just found it after 30 years in hiding, cleaned it and put a thin coat of oil on it. Never thought I would have to kill another human being after Vietnam, this is not my America, It’s Trumps Nazi America, I love my fellow men and women, some just don’t love me.
3316 2018-10-31 16:56:56 Basically I see the diminishing ice as the most undeniable proof that anyone should be able to understand who isn’t bought off by the GD oil companies. Chinese Hoax? I thought I had heard it all ...
I was wrong.
3317 2018-10-31 16:56:37 exactly why i got that $75 oil change for free 
3318 2018-10-31 16:56:29 Encore une fois on parle pas que de matière inerte, on parle d'individus qui agit sur comment utiliser telle matière mieux etc.. Depuis les années 70 on nous parle de peak oil sans arrêt et à chaque fois c'est repoussé (et évidemment les prophètes débiles ne sont plus là...).
3319 2018-10-31 16:56:23 the oil and gas industries have tons of politicians, mostly those on the right, in their pockets, and often tend to push a denial of anthropogenic climate change. (2/2)

... with a general downturn in economic growth and a slowdown in oil growth demand going forward, the loss of Iranian barrels now looks easily manageable - a scenario sure to cause consternation for Tehran.

3351 2018-10-31 16:52:25 They (inside Iran) are excellent at breaking things, can't build. In 1953 Iran was truly democratic. But CIA and British intelligence were worried it'd side with USSR, also oil fields GB wanted were nationalized. Look up TPAJAX. One group takes over. Kills previous. Cycle repeats

3359 2018-10-31 16:51:41 Ugh why are cars so fucking needy like why do you constantly need gas and need an oil change every now and then

Shah was forced into signing mossadegh's release from prime ministership. He'd refused vehemently because he also wanted to nationalize oil. Zion requires a weak Iran.

3377 2018-10-31 16:50:21 It wouldn't even be necessary if we'd built a pipeline to Ontario and Quebec so they didn't have to import foreign oil at world prices. As a nation, we caused our own problem.
3378 2018-10-31 16:50:20 Started my day off by going to get an oil change and now im so deep in my feelings . I just wanna prosper dawwg 
3379 2018-10-31 16:50:00 As a wild month comes to a close, the Japanese Yen is on the only G10 currency higher against the US Dollar as it strengthened 0.5% from the month's open while the Norwegian Krone that is positively correlated to crude oil is the largest loser against the $USD after falling 3.47%
3380 2018-10-31 16:49:43 It was a poor deal then; it remains so now. Nothing was done then because CPC didn’t need the votes here. No need to throw a sop to Alberta, especially when oil revenues were decent, was their mantra.

3413 2018-10-31 16:46:10 Internatonal factors like oil price, financial speculation etc. Also the neo-liberalism of the new government for sure will not improve the situation of the poor, but of the rich, as it did in any other country. And for this you want to sacrifice freedom and human rights?
3414 2018-10-31 16:46:04 Hi Katy, if you aren't using oil you need to remember not to preheat the pans as they conduct heat very quickly and that will be why your eggs are sticking. Crack them in to a cold pan then gently heat. Many thanks - JML

3420 2018-10-31 16:45:19 Bloody sad really, trying to create a rivalry which historically just isn’t there. Come back when you are part of the aristocracy and not just the nouveau rich. Oil money plastic Mancs 
3421 2018-10-31 16:45:19 You could do, but while you probably highlight their oil fund you should also pay attention to their high levels of business and personal taxation, and their high levels of foreign borrowing. Also the fact that they're worried about over-reliance on oil revenue.
3422 2018-10-31 16:45:12 Then, by all means, shut it down. But don't throw a hissy fit every time there is a train derailment that spills thousands of gallons of oil.
3423 2018-10-31 16:45:11 We'll jump together. In a vat that's already full of oil and burn the house down in an oil full of fuck-ups.

3432 2018-10-31 16:44:25 I’m getting my oil changed in my car and they always ask if I want them to go ahead and wash and vacuum it too. I said yes like I always do and I completely forgot it’s going to rain today. Now I feel bad :(
3433 2018-10-31 16:44:17 My freshman year of HS (2000, yikes) we played in a blizzard in the second round of playoffs against West Point CC. We had steel oil barrels with flames in them on the sideline to keep warm. I was on the KO team and remember getting drilled & looking up into the snow. Good times.
3434 2018-10-31 16:44:16 Isn’t that all we are in the US? One powerful police force hell bent on “spreading freedom and democracy” in the name of money, oil, and the UN?

3441 2018-10-31 16:43:48 We hope you find the benefits of CBD oil!

3451 2018-10-31 16:42:53 Welcome to the world of self imposed loss of rapeseed oil and a few other plant based derivatives. Still never mind,  a few more acres of rain forest will be cut down to increase palm oil production to compensate alongside all the enviromental costs of transportation
3452 2018-10-31 16:42:50 #Alberta Premier @RachelNotley turning her attention to the "great pipeline debate" says it has been "heated" at times.

3453 2018-10-31 16:42:48 Hey twitter, I don't suppose any of my followers are independently wealthy women looking for a husband? 

Or maybe rich young heiresses to oil companies or tech companies or something? 

Maybe?
3454 2018-10-31 16:42:42 its another sign the ICE OEMs are in a state of "business as usual" and only paying lip service to EV's. Their business models simply cannot shift away from dealers, service, engines, Oil.
3455 2018-10-31 16:42:16 Most people were #Readyfor100 a long time ago.
It was just Big Oil and Big Gas and Big Coal and their allies and cronies holding us back.
3456 2018-10-31 16:42:13 Also, US gets its oil from Canada, not Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia just has great control of price of oil everywhere

3458 2018-10-31 16:42:03 I still don’t see how voting is “going down swinging”. It does nothing, you’ve offered no evidence that it does. I don’t like what 45 is doing, but Obama was the last straw for me. Millions dead in Middle East for oil + you’re talking about 10k because the media told you to?

3462 2018-10-31 16:41:45 A sales tax, that's your answer?  Buddy over 42% of my wage goes to taxes, if I wanted to live in a socialized haven where nothing really gets done I'd move to Venezuala. You would rather import oil from other countries, who dont even meet our standards and destroy our economy.
3463 2018-10-31 16:41:44 Wow, I didn't even catch the initial joke. I really should jump in that boiling oil...

Specifically for NS at this point. Thx!
3485 2018-10-31 16:39:19 please is it crude oil or coconut oil ?I'm confused

3518 2018-10-31 16:36:26 Starting an oil fund now is hardly a sensible move, given the lack of revenue coming from oil taxation. And while you're clinging to the hope of some £30bn of oil you haven't presented any evidence for this, nor any explanation why SNP haven't whined about it?

3526 2018-10-31 16:35:06 I think we should stop using palm oil first. Or stop importing it. or both. Same is happening in Brasil with the new president.

3528 2018-10-31 16:34:49 Try the Bliss Kiss oil pen. It has jojoba oil, which I guess is the best. It's easy to keep in your pocket, and you just brush it on your nails and cuticles and rub it in. It made me have less "loose" bits to pick at, and makes your nails a lot stronger in the long run.

3540 2018-10-31 16:33:29 I look only at results. Do not care whether they are experts. Neither the EIA nor the IEA predicted the enourmous effect of oil shale developments.

3548 2018-10-31 16:33:01 Cars might be around 1/3, but transportation much larger share. The salient point is how this framing is typically used, to tamper down concerns about effects coming to the oil industry. Which is silly, because *everything* that matters to commodities happens at the margin.

3652 2018-10-31 16:22:59 The EIA has been notoriously bad at giving accurate predictions about anything. They were completely wrong with oil and natural gas and were convinced of the "peak oil" mantra which has been effectively tossed out of the window due to fracking. So get the facts and discount EIA.

3791 2018-10-31 16:08:59 Thank you. 

Will do a quick study on it. If it can match the qualities of olive oil or can come close to it then its marketability stretches to a huge consumer base as health conscious consumers have moved on to olive oil - although expensive it is still consumed!

3826 2018-10-31 16:06:27 I believe that Oil could likely test the swing high again at $67.95 & a break above it could push price towards 69-70.
3827 2018-10-31 16:06:26 how much is the oil?
3828 2018-10-31 16:06:11 waste of public money. when the prices of oil and consumer goods is on the rise, how can the govt spent so much amount of money, instead of building statues, half of the state may have gotten good infrastructure of schools and poor have got shelter.
3829 2018-10-31 16:06:08 Oil is hanging onto 200ma. Yesterday price did a shakeout on the downside to test 65.33 but was well defended. This is the 2nd attempt at the 65 zone. Previously, price hit 65.74 & bounced.

3850 2018-10-31 16:03:32 Scary morning. THE FUTURIST! made an appointment for an oil change for his car at gas station around the corner. While he waited to talk to mechanic, he had to sit on a frightening couch in the office. It actually sighed as he sat. He heard something moving under the cushion.

3920 2018-10-31 15:55:26 The decline trajectory was eased ~ wk 27, in alignment with OPEC+ action, beginning in ~ week 22 to + oil prod. This coincided with IR export surge, to capture pre-sanction sales. OPEC+ was not responding to mkt req's, but mkt outlook of impending IR outage. What goes up...

3950 2018-10-31 15:52:28 Of course Scots would be better off with 100% of oil and gas revs. That is why we didn't get that from start. It would have made independence too attractive. Have been campaigning for 63 yrs for Scots to run ALL their affairs. Before oil discovered

3952 2018-10-31 15:52:24 Egypt, Turkey and even Saudi Arabia have long histories of worker activism, especially Egypt. In Saudi Arabia most of the resources that they export, oil included, is on Shiah land and the government is brutally oppressive. Especially during the Arab spring.

3954 2018-10-31 15:52:22 Oh that is another keeper, thank you! I can say that I have successfully gotten both mine through gassy colic by giving them about a tablespoon of castor oil with a few drops of peppermint oil added, and then walking them, with another half dose given after about 20 mins. Works!
3955 2018-10-31 15:52:22 I should never almost need another oil change already

3960 2018-10-31 15:52:00 Mr. President, if you want to solve this problem you need my engine.  Why?  Because each person needs 40 hp and a car, not 40 acres and a mule.  80-95% of the fuel gone.  Power allows people to come out of poverty.  New engine is the ticket to free world of oil.

3963 2018-10-31 15:51:31 You just highlighted my point again. How did they come up with the conclusion that some states need it and some don't? That palm oil rice and agege bread is the solution to keep kids in school in some states and not in others?
3964 2018-10-31 15:51:24 How would the the world be without oil and gas? Do you think life would be easier?

3965 2018-10-31 15:51:23 12-15mgs CBD oil ingested sublingually could help. Creams are great too but those are better for muscle pains, not the cramps I know you're talking about.

3972 2018-10-31 15:50:26 I like Tony, but that's likely a strictly business decision. Without a plausible mechanism, it's snake oil, which for all its fake claim faults at least deadened some pain due to the high alcohol content. Do you have any business interests in the product, or it's sales?

3974 2018-10-31 15:50:05 You are a charlatan. Snake oil salesman. You are trying to gaslight the universe. This will not end well for you.
3975 2018-10-31 15:49:52 Oh dear lol, crazy! I have a ottb that used to be a crazy hard keeper. Have you tried rice bran oil or coco soya? It works wonders for my guy
3976 2018-10-31 15:49:51 i dont know who needs to hear this but dont put tea tree oil on your piercings

3978 2018-10-31 15:49:44 Saudi's, not only don't like Iran but they are under the international pressure for the butchering of a Journalist In their embassy in Istanbul, so they are looking for friends, Trump has offer a friendship if they increase the oil production before the midterm US election.
3979 2018-10-31 15:49:30 Sana oil
3980 2018-10-31 15:49:26 Just STOP buying VENEZUELAN OIL
3981 2018-10-31 15:49:17 All the shots this week of the French Landscape piece - made with wine and oil paint...
3982 2018-10-31 15:49:12 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
3983 2018-10-31 15:48:51 Interesting that CVE has essentially no hedges for next year (~5% production is hedged for 2019) and they don't plan on increasing it. I love it! I find it foolish when oil companies hedge. It's a waste of money, and the stocks tank anyways when oil tanks.
3984 2018-10-31 15:48:48 I’ll bring the blessing oil you just hold em down 
3985 2018-10-31 15:48:47 Oil+gas=Old Testament.  Solar+wind=New Testament.

3986 2018-10-31 15:48:40 You two are a hoot.
3987 2018-10-31 15:48:38 I second the motion, I'll provide a class, smart board and chairs for the lesson
3988 2018-10-31 15:48:34 Agree with you on the principle of course.. but isn't there a decision from 2013 about raising NOC staff salaries by 67% ? and isnt raising oil sector salaries, on par, more value adding than other value subtracting public sector jobs in education or senior civil servants?
3989 2018-10-31 15:48:32 He just said he was preaching AGAINST Jesus, there's a difference. The main point is that Muslims don't preach against Jesus.
3990 2018-10-31 15:48:10 @Valvoline I just found out during a warranty repair on my car that your technicians replaced my oil drain plug without telling me and the one they put in is defective.
3991 2018-10-31 15:48:09 tea tree oil, my bestie used it and it really worked for her
3992 2018-10-31 15:48:08 Good gravy, people.
3993 2018-10-31 15:48:00 CBD oil!
3994 2018-10-31 15:47:51 Therefore now the price is low and reserves are lower meaning the oil take is dropping Scotland receives transfers from RUK. The beauty of being in a proper union I guess. it is what the EU does not have - wealth transfers from poorer to richer hence the euro doesn't work.
3995 2018-10-31 15:47:46 PB was invented by Satan, its just wrong like WHO the fuck looked at peanuts and said “hmmm lemme blend you up with some oil” WtF
3996 2018-10-31 15:47:41 Aframax is a medium-sized crude tanker with a dead weight tonnage (DWT) ranging between 80,000 and 120,000. The tanker derives its name from AFRA which stands for Average Freight Rate Assessment. AFRA system was created in 1954 by Shell Oil to standardise contract terms.

4000 2018-10-31 15:47:17 @sibeledmonds Nov 5 is Iran sanction day Nov 6 Congressional election I am predicting huge conflict in making. China Russia and India have warned they will continue buying Iran oil by “force”
4001 2018-10-31 15:47:12 Used motor oil works as a great stain remover for heavily soiled laundry.

4003 2018-10-31 15:46:54 when bear gets healthy i hope this Garrison experiment comes to an end.  i think they need to fully understand what offensive skills nurse has, he can skate and i hope he can hit the net from the point, let him try.  plus he sucked yesterday on the PK.
4004 2018-10-31 15:46:52 bro. women do not get oil changes in their car fam.
4005 2018-10-31 15:46:50 $tsla $nio EV don't burn oil it burn shorts! :)) $tsla headin for $1k $nio to $60. :))
4006 2018-10-31 15:46:48 Boss I just followed you can you follow back, I need your help too
4007 2018-10-31 15:46:46 Obviously murder is not murder when suits your agenda- like Oil and Arms Sales!
4008 2018-10-31 15:46:45 America is the one who spoiled Iraq and looted all the reserves of gold and all its wealth of oil
Iraq does not have nuclear weapons
America is the cause of terrorism in the Arab region and is funded by money and weapons
4009 2018-10-31 15:46:34 You're out of order!Iran is your bogeyman! Saudi continues to fund terrorism world all over but you choose to turn a blind eye-courtesy of oil/arms dollars.Iran has fought terrorism than any other middle eastener;but remains a bad boy!
4010 2018-10-31 15:46:25 Of course for about 20 years it contributed oil revenue based tax to the Exchequer so was in surplus. Now that situation is reversed. But that is the Union, Scotland's taxation position is very dependent on its oil taxation which is very volatile because the price is volatile.
4011 2018-10-31 15:46:21 They are confusing GDP and Exports:

Oil is 16% of GDP 
But 90% of it's exports
4012 2018-10-31 15:46:17 changing a tyre, checking oil , filling up with fuel and maintenace should be part of the driving test!!
4013 2018-10-31 15:46:15 Denzel getting an oil change at 2:00pm.
4014 2018-10-31 15:46:11 We do not live in an ideal world sir. How about the government stop taking in refugees with a different ideology and take care of the Brits? Politicians selling  out to foreign oil money and atheist socialism to overthrow Christianity and British culture. Give it 30 years.
4015 2018-10-31 15:45:53 2 new tires today, oil change next week. Vehicle should be ready for winter after that. About time I got off my butt and got things done.
4016 2018-10-31 15:45:48 Please DON'T push the panic button because a unfounded poll.
BTW , there is nothing wrong with TX and Texans .

Still , it's the biggest oil $$$ donor to the GOP.

Don't forget THAT
4017 2018-10-31 15:45:44 This express oil change place is just playing AAA ads on the TV. 
Y’all can’t put on a morning talk show?
4018 2018-10-31 15:45:43 luckily oil haikupatikana muranga
4019 2018-10-31 15:45:40 I mean, this is moderation in America - supporting oil and gas, and otherwise doing nothing. Governor Cuomo (R-NY) is the same.
4020 2018-10-31 15:45:38 Trying to find someone now to go ahead & move the RV to a spot at nearby seasonal park to store while I’m away since no luck selling it. Today’s weather isn’t helping because I need to tighten up containers in toy hauler & get oil changed & laundry done.
4021 2018-10-31 15:45:36 Twinning tracks is fine but oil should go in pipelines. Grain, potash and other freight by rail.
4022 2018-10-31 15:45:35 Y’all. I’m adulting well today. Looking into buying a set of tires (ouch, bank acct.), getting an oil change, talking to insurance this morning.
4023 2018-10-31 15:45:34 Yassss. Pero ako yung sinasabaw ko sa kanin is yung chicken oil ng mang inasal. Bahahahahahhahahahah
4024 2018-10-31 15:45:23 Stop comparing Turkana found oil to Murang'a Water, Oil is a mineral, It's classified under fossils fuels, Water is just water, it has zero environmental degradation. 

We pay for the treatment and convenience of not going to fetch from its source Aberdare Forest not water.
4025 2018-10-31 15:45:20 Why would you need oil for the salsa??
4026 2018-10-31 15:45:15 Tell me how my roommates used up two extra large bottles of oil in under 1 month and mine still hasn’t been refilled in 2 months….thats disgusting????
4027 2018-10-31 15:45:12 As he tweets from a country with universal healthcare and one of the world's highest standards of living, thanks in part to a wellhead tax on oil companies drilling in Norwegian waters. Assuming that's where he really is, personally, I think he lives east of me. 
4028 2018-10-31 15:45:09 chicken oil talaga sa mang inasal yung inaaalala ko e hays lol

4032 2018-10-31 15:44:43 He is right ! The genocide for oil has to stop. So many innocents being killed.
4033 2018-10-31 15:44:35 Hey CBD Oil Revolution(@CBD__Revolution), thank you for following me
4034 2018-10-31 15:44:35 Waste water and long-term aquifer contamination with brines & organics always seems like the more problematic consideration. Go to older oil and gas fields and you find a great many problems due to improper waste disposal and increased vertical fluid flow via annular fractures...
4035 2018-10-31 15:44:24 Think I’ve reached the point where my hair is more Argan oil than hair, but it’s SO SOFT!!
4036 2018-10-31 15:44:20 I still remember watching that the first time it aired. The episode of Beavis and Butthead it's  on is Oil Change. 
4037 2018-10-31 15:44:02 So is this saying that you apply Chamomile oil to the breast and you have a great chance of curing breast cancer?  If it only worked that easy.  This is the "problem" with natural medicine.   People think you can cure disease with simple applications or monotherapy.
4038 2018-10-31 15:44:01 God we thank you for waking us to see another day. Thank you for brand new mercies. Before our feet hit the ground, make the crooked places straight, command the enemy to flee, build a hedge of protection around us, anoint our heads with oil, cover us with the blood of Jesus.
4039 2018-10-31 15:44:00 LOL so we can stop subsidizing the oil industry?  And the agriculture industry?  Hey let's try that, more money for retired boy over here.
4040 2018-10-31 15:43:41 I have a 35 minute wait to get my oil changed. I turned around to sit down & thought okay I have to adult adult today. Where’s my dad when I need him? 
4041 2018-10-31 15:43:40 ... And so does Black Seed Oil, A.K.A. Black Cumin Oil... Check the studies!
4042 2018-10-31 15:43:32 And that was without the oil.
4043 2018-10-31 15:43:29 Just cut a tiny garlic into pieces and heat them in oil for few minutes. Make sure u don't burn them cause I did, that burning smell reached to my mom and I heard few curse words coming to me from her room. Meanwhile, cook/make the soup noodles normally like you do and then
4044 2018-10-31 15:43:28 depends if your paint is oil based or water based
4045 2018-10-31 15:43:28 God we thank you for waking us to see another day. Thank you for brand new mercies. Before our feet hit the ground, make the crooked places straight, command the enemy to flee, build a hedge of protection around us, anoint our heads with oil, cover us with the blood of Jesus.
4046 2018-10-31 15:43:26 Texas is the big ole oil $$$ extremely Red. 
To the extent to call them all Texans stupid..that's a strech.
$$$ buys everything & so it does buy Presidents.
Not all Texans are stupid Red Republicans.
4047 2018-10-31 15:43:06 When did Ds care about environment. Mother Jones exposed Hillary 4 hiding ties to KXL. She yet KXL hire an oil man to write the environmental impact statement & passed it off as State Dept-not 2 mention selling fracking 2 the world
4048 2018-10-31 15:43:03 There is no coal mine. Only oil and gas pipeline?
4049 2018-10-31 15:42:50 Sana oil may pera 
4050 2018-10-31 15:42:48 Starting off calling it sad news what a tell.  It's your wet dream to have real dirt on Mueller.  If it were anything but a crock you would start "we are happy to announce".  You fraud.  Hope you get deep sixed after mueller wins his own requested investigation.  Snake oil man.
4051 2018-10-31 15:42:42 
4052 2018-10-31 15:42:42 get back inline...plenty of oil stocks arrme unfairly priced
4053 2018-10-31 15:42:24 They have freedom of movement and pay for the privilege of being in/access to the single market.

But unlike the EU is Norway's biggest trading partner and has a healthy trade surplus thanks to their oil.

They have had to accept 3/4 of all EU laws.

So to the Norway option.

4085 2018-10-31 15:38:44 Is shortage of oil and grain cars the issue or is it shortage of track space? Why don't both oil and grain get together and push to twin the tracks.
4086 2018-10-31 15:38:39 I have been looking into that. I think i will try it.  I did read about starting out slow.  I just started taking diatomaceous earth and blackseed oil.  I know it takes more than that.  Its a slow start. Thank you

4089 2018-10-31 15:38:31 The USA can't ignore the fact is the worse human catastrophe as the world asking the USA to d something about it, in reality still arms for oil and USA will carry on supporting the Saudis policy in the middle east is business as usual.

4098 2018-10-31 15:37:30 Can be used as a salad dressing! In addition you can add the oil to smoothies, yoghurts, and cereals!

4101 2018-10-31 15:36:55 Sounds like Aberdeen in the days of North Sea Trawling.  But sold our Souls for North Sea Oil.  Yes, made it a very rich City, but at a certain cost to our traditions.  All the Old Fishing Torry and the new Torry is is Polish.  For good or bad.  Definitely totally different.

4119 2018-10-31 15:34:49 10 years ago, Crude Oil fell 32.6% for the month of October as the global financial crisis was taking hold.

@DailyFXTeam
4120 2018-10-31 15:34:46 Yes. Agreed. Ten years they (Russ Oil Industry)  to gear up and prep for low sulphur. They are not ready yet and it's going to cost them dearly.  What they need is an intervention. A coincidence perhaps that it's come from Trump!
4121 2018-10-31 15:34:44 When I send you your wedding invitation, I'm going to smother it in chicken oil.
4122 2018-10-31 15:34:44 The Saudi monarchy places no value on human life except for their own corrupt asses. United States has given them value because of their oil. The corrupt Trump mafia gives them value because of their money. They, in turn show their respect by murder.
4123 2018-10-31 15:34:41 Oil change 
4124 2018-10-31 15:34:35 He's @realDonaldTrump trying to deflect everyone for the real issues and that there is a #bluewave forming and he can't handle what his future may look like after Nov 6th.. Don't fall for his lunatic actions anymore.. he's a snake oil sellsmen VOTE!!   #BirthrightCitizenship
4125 2018-10-31 15:34:28 I guna micellar water from simple! Kenapa babe, you dah beli ke maybelline tu? Susah hilang eh? Use olive oil, then wipe with wet tissue
4126 2018-10-31 15:34:17 Kalau tak minat cleansing oil, boleh try cleansing balm or cleansing milk 
4127 2018-10-31 15:34:15 Sweet so the oil industry is behind all of this single-use trash that will clog our landfills and oceans in the name of temporary “festivity.”

4134 2018-10-31 15:33:53 But the oil cartel fixes their own prices don't they? The ONLY legal cartel that can production and price-fix at will.
4135 2018-10-31 15:33:29 It’s not hard to avoid Palm Oil and other deforestation plant products, or intensively, unsustainable food etc, shop wisely and read labels, buy local plant food. Thing is though by merely being we impact on others, we have to draw a collective and individual moral line.
4136 2018-10-31 15:33:28 Many kenyan food vloggers should stop narrating unnecessary things of what they are doing, 
" as you can see I am waiting for the oil to heat up so I can put the onions...

4163 2018-10-31 15:30:55 and if oil fades next year and BLS wage growth trends over 3% in 2019, the data will look better on a YoY basis for sure
4164 2018-10-31 15:30:48 Maybe—but this is also a seasonal weak season for crude prices as refineries shutdown to switch over to more heating oil output.

Do the oil companies think everyone in Oakville are millionaires? A lot of average people here on average wages. Why the ripoff - high taxes? @fordnation
4176 2018-10-31 15:30:03 Heavy economic game where players are building unique runs of pipe that are linked to matching colors of oil (representing diff types). Oil requires refinement & each type of oil requires diff lengths of pipe runs to be refined to 3 different levels above base crude oil.

It’s the same as my U.K government, they’re also corrupt and spineless. And let’s not forget the suffering of the poor Yemeni’s.
4222 2018-10-31 15:25:30 In GA over 5500 have a card but it’s of little use. We can’t grow or buy in our state. We have to break federal law to get our meds. We can have oil at 5% thc legally. I’m off pharmas but some days I don’t go out of the house.

4256 2018-10-31 15:20:59 How and where are the rule of law not being respected? Where is that affecting businesses that pay taxes to the state? Since the state mostly collects taxes on oil please tell me how that affects the global price of oil. I’ll wait.....

4258 2018-10-31 15:20:47 This article talks about drilling. As I stated before oil and gas development is more than drilling and tank batteries. There is an upstream, midstream and downstream side. The wording of 112 is stated to be all oil and gas development not just drilling setbacks.
4259 2018-10-31 15:20:46 Getting my oil change
4260 2018-10-31 15:20:25 US will do nothing because they need Saudi to make up any oil shortfall brought about by The Donald’s new sanctions on Iran.
4261 2018-10-31 15:20:22 Cooking classes can be somewhat useful. But what about how to change a tire and check your oil-- unless you grow up around that stuff, there is literally no way to learn. (except maybe YouTube nowadays, but we didn't have that).
4262 2018-10-31 15:20:08 I need to change my oil and clean my car rugs
4263 2018-10-31 15:20:04 at dahil maarte ako di na ko mage-extra rice dito sa mang inasal kase walang chicken oil
4264 2018-10-31 15:19:52 Ugh. Cant we have anything that's mass produced that's ethical? How hard is it to replace palm oil in candy???
4265 2018-10-31 15:19:39 MashAllah you are educated enough to know that don't put oil on the fire
4266 2018-10-31 15:19:29 I swear my cannabis vape cartridges lose oil while I'm sleeping. 

And, no, I don't have kids. I have dogs. Dogs can't vape. No lips.

4270 2018-10-31 15:19:12 Loooooool! Nutrition wasn't the issue tho. And as you can see from what they're feeding the kids, there's no nutrition either. Agege bread and palm oil rice (and banana only when a celebrity is around) is not nutrition.
4271 2018-10-31 15:19:06 Israeli PM:  "We were lucky to be one of the few countries in the Middle East without Oil".

4278 2018-10-31 15:18:33 These types of incidents only highlight the mere fact that regulators are either asleep at the wheel or are in cahoots with these snake oil salesman to turn a profit. It seems that in the search for "the next big profitable thing" people are ready to ignore conflicts of interest.

4284 2018-10-31 15:17:58 right i've been meat free for about 2 yrs, stopped eating eggs, cheese and chocolate, and i can usually get milk under .5 pints a day. i am however eating peanut butter to the extent where the palm oil consumption is worse than all the meat i'm not eating.

4290 2018-10-31 15:17:23 Chef Skinner cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with cheese.
4291 2018-10-31 15:17:15 I doubt the US is actually purchasing oil from Iran.
The goal is to have all other countries, including especially China, India, Japan, South Korea, Turkey and a list of European states, to stop purchasing oil from Iran.
4292 2018-10-31 15:17:08 The entire global economy is tied up in oil, like quick dope money for a criminal cartel; an economy entirely regulated and tightly controlled to sustain the same, with a non-competition clause monopoly, and anti-free enterprise and anti-free trade.
4293 2018-10-31 15:16:46 Or that crude oil is decomposed dinosaurs.

4311 2018-10-31 15:15:17 @cpr_mike Please stop referring to Prop 112 as a setback between oil wells and homes & schools.  This is inaccurate and misleading. It goes light-years beyond that. Please read & understand the wording of the proposition.

4314 2018-10-31 15:15:03 The truth about the 'Jabardast' Saudi package is that he has got 2 months credit on oil supply. 

The other USD 3 billion is money that will be kept in State Bank of Pakistan, which cannot be used for any purpose.

4339 2018-10-31 15:12:08 The president made smart comment. But he missed why Ghanaians are worried with loans. The current loans, what are we using them for is the problem. Borrow to create new regions? Borrow to be used to go for lunch for 10k? Or borrow to spend on oil that evaporates with no justice?

4392 2018-10-31 15:06:00 There's nothing like Halloween in Nigeria o

If you see people in funny evil costumes at night those are your village people trying to press you.

4400 2018-10-31 15:05:10 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4401 2018-10-31 15:05:00 10 years ago, Crude Oil fell 32.6% for the month of October as the global financial crisis was taking hold.
4402 2018-10-31 15:04:53 Far as I see no one is building a pipeline under ur watch. U had 4 yrs òf telling us how cons were wrong and u would get it done. Now under ur watch we also have C69 to fight cause it will shut down the oil industry for ever. U ARE A TOTAL FAILURE.
4403 2018-10-31 15:04:48 I yell at my son about this EVERYDAY!!! Trust me, I'm trying. I remind him that just because your dad is lightskin and you can't see he's ashy doesn't mean you can do that. You're brown. And ashy. Hit that shea baby oil...

Throw the whole car away.

4408 2018-10-31 15:04:13 Love to eat plants but this 'plant based' thing is getting silly. If I see one more press release I will poke my eyes out with sharpened carrot. Palm oil is plant based, doesn't make it a good thing either for our health, the environment or orang-utans. PS Vegan cats go blind
4409 2018-10-31 15:03:43 What about potato chips fried in coconut oil?
4410 2018-10-31 15:03:42 Please tell us the Investments you will make as a President that  will change Nigeria at once which Buhari is not presently doing given our current low proceeds from oil.
4411 2018-10-31 15:03:34 Hi there. We are exploring routes to offer vegan-accredited products to meet this demand. In addition, we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years and are on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
4412 2018-10-31 15:03:33 Oh, is this a cooking or salad oil?
4413 2018-10-31 15:03:29 #Mantashe: The delay in the implementation of the MPRD, has delayed the development of the oil and gas industry. The provisions of the MPRDA are explicit in terms of participation of black people and transformation in the sector. The Bill will be ready in three weeks time.
4414 2018-10-31 15:03:27 I heard that, too. The Koch brothers are behind this. Big Oil for big profits to the dirty, bought  politicians. I’m counting on the SMART voters! Let’s tell Eduardo, the Canadian, to go back to Canada.
4415 2018-10-31 15:03:21 I want to know if the oil inside... If it's Power Oil or Kings Oil

4419 2018-10-31 15:03:02 To encourage (production) #relocation, you want to shrink the cost advantage (assuming this is reason #1) by:
1/ increasing #tariff (done);
2/ increasing shipping costs. For that you might welcome higher oil price and tougher regulations on gas emissions.

4428 2018-10-31 15:01:36 Is it oil and gas fields?
4429 2018-10-31 15:01:15 I don't think the author really understands what growth means, if demand is growing for oil it means that we have to produce more every day, not less. I think he mixes up "slowing growth" with decline.

October 2018 Crude Oil Price 70$ per Barrel/ Petrol Price Rs 80

Can explain why it was cheaper in 2013 ? I am not getting the point.
4489 2018-10-31 14:57:18 Yeah, those are the questions he should be asked. We got no reserves now,  we feel every oil price increases.  And some morons blame Ramaphosa saying since he came in the price of fuel is going up forgetting that we had a crook president before Ramaphosa.

4631 2018-10-31 14:42:40 Very small — we estimating 15 000 tonnes or so this year. The opportunity could perhaps be in soybean oil cake imports, which are still at levels around 480 000 tonnes, down from nearly a million tonnes in 2010.

4676 2018-10-31 14:37:20 Where’s a good oil change shop in Valdosta?
4677 2018-10-31 14:37:16 But even when you think about it, the math is only wrong right now. Say oil rises in price and the refining costs pass on the consumer cost. 10$ in taxes can reasonably elevate a 4.25$/per gallon to 5$. So it’s possibly right, just not with today’s prices

4786 2018-10-31 14:28:55 1st, it's not "tar" you id!ot, it's bitumen.
2nd, heavy oils are not discounted on the world market.
3rd, the current discount is due to lack of market access as well as lack of transport options.
And last, it's the same oil but the discount is higher than ever. Educate yourself.

4789 2018-10-31 14:28:34 That works for me except on jury days. Gotta do a full beard trim, beard oil, beard balm. And I'm always tempted to go full Daniel Day Lewis from There Will Be Blood, but I always chicken out.

4794 2018-10-31 14:28:13 I never said trump was a Nazi, weird that you went there, I was just stating that fascism and democracy are like oil and water, there is no place for nazis in our society. Period. Like I said man #nazisgetlead
4795 2018-10-31 14:28:00 Beto was awesome on Hardball! Unlike Cruz, he answered questions directly & didn't deflect. He's everything I want in a Senator- intelligent, qualified, capable, honest, compassionate, has values similar to mine, not owned by NRA, Oil, or Russia, & wants to work for ALL Texans.

4804 2018-10-31 14:26:43 Noah's great at math. Not sure he's quite a genius at it, but he's sharp. Just dyslexic and his stupid parents never got him help for it.
4805 2018-10-31 14:26:31 I just realized Al-Farouq Aminu is an anagram for Aquaman Fir Oil. I mean... that could explain why he doesn't always look natural on land. (inspiration for one of you with Photoshop skills?) #RipCity
4806 2018-10-31 14:26:28 Every time I feel I'm about to get a cold, I put a few drops of oregano oil into a small beverage and chug it down...it tastes NASTY! I do this a few times in the day...

I almost never get a cold after doing this.

4813 2018-10-31 14:25:39 Oil and gas companies are increasingly using prototypes during product development to test certain properties before series production begins. Creating prototypes with #additivemanufacturing enables the production of complex, multi-element components as a single, integrated part.

4827 2018-10-31 14:24:17 Selling oil would be my guess 
4828 2018-10-31 14:24:07 We don’t need more oil on the seas, we need modern energy solutions that exist. AB needs to get a sales tax and away from its boom/bust one trick pony. You are better than that!

4837 2018-10-31 14:23:13 good morning to everyone except those who cook their eggs in oil
4838 2018-10-31 14:23:04 Better insulation is also necessary, and, it too, is often just simply unprofitable, so, again, the way production is organized now makes it unfeasible. That's why an immediate end to oil and gas requires an immediate end to capitalism.
4839 2018-10-31 14:23:03 Walked in for my free oil change walked out paying 200 how does that work
4840 2018-10-31 14:22:50 Yung feeling na para kang piprituhin or nilelechon right after paglabas mo ng spa. So much oil. 
4841 2018-10-31 14:22:30 Yeah, I live on Vancouver Island. Exactly, we don’t need more oil on the seas, we need modern energy solutions that exist. AB needs to get a sales tax and away from its boom/bust one trick pony. You are better than that!
4842 2018-10-31 14:22:26 Drop it. Keep your nose in FL. If saudis cut oil production, gas may cost over $4/gallon. Our economy slows & Floridians will not vote for you.

4861 2018-10-31 14:20:45 It’s ok to sell at whatever the market offers for that low level oil. It’s not light, sweet crude. It’s tar, diluted to make it liquify and therefore not the same. It will always be discounted. Worse now that shipping laws make it unusable. The product is substandard, thus the $.
4862 2018-10-31 14:20:41 Thanks Alison 
Are @EC_magazine claiming we use palm oil?
4863 2018-10-31 14:20:31 What is even more futile is taking the National Post, seriously, when it comes to climate change. Not one of your writers has a background in science and there is a conflict of interest when your paper is owned by an American hedge fund that seems 2B a PR firm for Big Oil
4864 2018-10-31 14:20:28 Why do you think they are investing across the globe with that oil revenue now?
4865 2018-10-31 14:20:23 trying this new lavender cream that's said to fade scars but... it goes on really nicely (a watery gel) and smells heavenly but i think my skin's reacting to it... too much essential oil mayhaps
4866 2018-10-31 14:20:20 Oil?! Get them on the bong, lad!!! On a more serious note though try @ForbiddenVape they specialise in CBD oils and all that sort of stuff.

4869 2018-10-31 14:20:14 I'm sick of the South Sudanese politicians riding any white governments dick, especially CHINA. If they've been supporting South Sudan after all these years, WHAT CHANGE HAVE THEY MADE? ALL these organisations are just stealing OUR oil and claiming that they're helping us

4871 2018-10-31 14:19:53 See? If you don't even know that, how can you so confidently tell me I'm wrong? The whole thing is a damn NARRATIVE. Helped by MIC- Military Industrial Complex. Oil, Banking, Global arms-chemical-pharma. All controlled by a relatively few, a tight circle of dynastic billionaires.
4872 2018-10-31 14:19:45 In addition, the real subsidy is on our infrastructure. We need to increase gas/diesel tax to pay for that. Best way is increase it by .01/gal each month for 50-100 months.
Gas portion to state, diesel to fed.
This would do more to help EV/stop oil than anything else.

Liquid lanolin oil on the underwire channels stopped the noise!

4880 2018-10-31 14:19:17 Shut down the pipeline and it won't make a bit of difference. The oil was still get pumped but will now be transported via rail cars which is many times more susceptible to oil spills than any pipeline.

4949 2018-10-31 14:12:56 Depends on whose perspective. So far we've avoided nuclear war & protected commerce & the flow of oil for ourselves & our allies-but too many countries have been left behind & worse. Yet, I'd agree our imperialism is preferable to Russia's or China's. But we must be better.

4980 2018-10-31 14:09:13 Anti-competitive trusts have been enemies of open & free trade for centuries.

We realised this long ago which is why we no longer operate under a medieval guild system.

Just like Standard Oil, the Silicon valley trust needs to be busted.
4981 2018-10-31 14:09:13 One could understand if for every criticism made about an individual’s performance you cry race. Are you implying race is related to performance? We’re not. You invoke! No more bait on this tired old line of BS.

4991 2018-10-31 14:08:02 Pipelines moving Canadian oil uses extremely less energy than the east bringing it in from the Middle East. 1000s of Canadian jobs and revenue for Canada. Don’t worry about that though because I’m the problem for not buying an electric car.
4992 2018-10-31 14:08:00 Who pushes and shoves in a Q for cooking oil? Who is in a Q for sugar? People get phoned to come and get commodities when delivered.

5016 2018-10-31 14:06:18 Oil Imports are the biggest driver of falling rupee even after capital investments and increased exports during NDA1 and NDA2.

Increasing export is the only solution to create a balance (like China).

5063 2018-10-31 14:00:53 I horrified to see this  contains  palm oil,  WTF is palm oil in this  for? No way would I use this. Buttercream   icing should only  contain  butter, icing sugar and a splash of milk, simple to make and  not  killing our planet.

5065 2018-10-31 14:00:48 Venezuela's biggest problem is Oil. 

Oil production is only 16% of its GDP but 90% of its Exports

It sold Govt Debt in USD - instead of its own currency - so it needs to buy USD to pay interest and to redeem it.

Oil bunkering

Budget padding by legislators

Clerics, Traditional & politicians trooping to Aso rock for Brown envelopes.

The eight core industries are coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity. -- here we go....
5074 2018-10-31 14:00:30 Nobody knows what #oil's true global decline rates are much less how fast they are growing. But another bullish factor at work that Matt Simmons used to focus on is how oil consumption is growing in producer nations which means less oil for the ROW.

5085 2018-10-31 13:59:21 Hi @algore. Can I ask how much you raised or donated to support #YesOn112 ? I ask because the oil and gas industry has been relentless in their pursuit to stop it and they’ve put in *huge* amounts of money in that effort.

Transportation, food, business
, its unfortunately needed to sustain us.

If anything, this seems to be a call to transition technology away from this substance faster then ever before.
5116 2018-10-31 13:56:31 You're correct, big oil has no interest at all in protecting anything except the flow of money.  We in CO. Have a chance to tell them what we believe is more important.

5128 2018-10-31 13:55:27 I’ve stopped buying any EU products out of protest for the way the are treating us. It’s only 30% of our food. We make better Brie than the French I’ve found, and olive oil. Hit ‘em where it hurts we say. Most of my pals are doing the same.

Conservatives need to realize we can save far more with investing in active transport than subsidizing oil and gas. Makes cents.

5204 2018-10-31 13:47:16 Why get a college degree in STEM when it's so much easier to get one in Victimology.
5205 2018-10-31 13:47:10 If i die today its because the place we get oil changed at only plays hgtv all the time. Pray for my patience.
5206 2018-10-31 13:47:04 Good for them. Too bad the oil companies will start up a suaidary just to buy the rights to the tech and then shelve it so it doesn't have a chance to succeed.
5207 2018-10-31 13:46:58 My parents let me & my brothers decide. Unfortunately there’s no trade school class for public relations (me), Japanese (middle brother is now fluent), or music performance/education (youngest brother).
5208 2018-10-31 13:46:54 Pak should focus on ties with iran like china. They are riched in oil and gas resources and these energies are the drivers for betterment and can bring sustainability in economy.

I need to practice more with paints.
5211 2018-10-31 13:46:15 Maasa, better we go drill for oil. Would be more likely to succeed at that. Corruption is part of the national fabric. Rooting it out would need a kind of social chemotherapy, a course the likes of which we are not given to embarking on. To many sacred cows to offend & impede.

5213 2018-10-31 13:45:59 This further highlights the insane decision to have the NEB consider downstream emissions in order to kill EnergyEast (in favour of ongoing imported oil).

5216 2018-10-31 13:45:52 You will also buy new condenser + the compressor, oil and refrigerant..... I feel your pain. It has happened to me
5217 2018-10-31 13:45:46 I believe the best corollary with the current situation is found in the parable of the Ten Virgins. All are going around collecting oil & preparing. Key to understanding this parable is that all 10 have a seat at the table (all are members of the Church). HALF are found wanting.

5231 2018-10-31 13:44:35 Yes. The last few decades haven't fully appreciated just how unstoppably good Midnight Oil was circa Blue Sky Mining—and how far they'd come. (Capricornia is a very good late-career effort from them.)

5237 2018-10-31 13:44:09 haha but it's about the tax regulations. Just like how parachute hair oil avoided tax for long by listing it as a edible oil instead as cosmetic product for which tax % is way higher

5248 2018-10-31 13:42:43 Matt, you are a shill for the oil/gas industry and former staffer for climate-denier James Inhofe (R-OK). Your opinion on how science and evidence work is frankly irrelevant to me. But everyone else on this thread might be interested to know what hill you are shouting from.

5255 2018-10-31 13:42:16 Like, really, at the end of the day the problem with oil isn't necessarily oil itself, but the fact that we literally just light it on fire. Oil is useful and necessary for a lot of applications, and we'll continue to need it in some form or another.
5256 2018-10-31 13:42:06 I’m at the dealer getting an oil change, this man goes “OH MY GOD YOUR RING IS GORGEOUS!” I always like go say “yeah he did good didn’t he”

5263 2018-10-31 13:41:28 Most of the stuff we import from the EU is not available at the quality, quantity or for the same value as that from the EU. It just isn’t. Examples, olives/olive oil and tinned tomatoes, pork products and dairy products.
5264 2018-10-31 13:41:13 That oil change and rotation was needed.

5269 2018-10-31 13:40:43 Well, yes, it matters. For instance, its funny how often the oil company scientists or Philip Morris scientists came up with results that went against what everyone else was getting- and these were used to sow confusion and delay proper interventions for decades (and now).

5279 2018-10-31 13:40:02 At least in the US, fracking itself causes almost no earthquakes - it's much deeper disposal of fracking (and other oil/gas production) wastewater by injection. Just that seems difficult to explain to people.

5297 2018-10-31 13:37:36 See now I have to go graph how much oil/gas is burned to extract one barrel of oil from the ground (or conversely, how many barrels it takes to produce the required products to get one barrel out).

You see where I'm going with this ;)
5298 2018-10-31 13:37:33 Ahh crap, I read it. There is only 1 herb in the list for starters. The rest is drivel written by a snake oil seller for use by the desperate and gullible.

5310 2018-10-31 13:36:15 Once we're not burning it into the atmosphere, using oil to continue to make some polymers and plastics (assuming we can solve the garbage patch problems) is probably entirely feasible.
5311 2018-10-31 13:36:10 hahahahaha oil

5313 2018-10-31 13:36:05 No doubt! I got in just ahead of Violator, and did my usual reverse-trawl through the back catalog. I got diminishing returns.

5317 2018-10-31 13:35:56 I think Mederma works for any kind of scars but I’ve heard from people that Bio oil works(usage of 2-4 months) for acne and stretch marks better(only new scars not old).
5318 2018-10-31 13:35:43 I put money on the oil. You now have a better understanding.
5319 2018-10-31 13:35:43 Actually the oil shale exit is already ongoing process with two oldest blocks closing in 2019. There are social, economic and energetic risks associated with this process. The petition is demanding a plan, as the current Estonian plan is that free market will solve everything.

5337 2018-10-31 13:33:32 Precisely what I'm referring to.

Okay, devil's advocate with additional arguments:
- How to diversify the economy when it's mostly petrochem
- How do we get the components for advanced tech without oil (polymers, plastics, etc)
5338 2018-10-31 13:33:30 Zimbabwe, today you can't even buy a Coke. Fuel shortages, lack of basic essentials (sugar, flour, cooking oil, etc.). This is what America will become if you vote for democrats.

5348 2018-10-31 13:32:34 No. I don't think so. Whether capacity is full boar or not, #oil inventories are rising.

Not sure what the confusion is about leading into #Iran sanctions. Saudi said they'd pump in May when Trump left the nuke deal and oil went parabolic.

Mean reverting reality is a mug.

5410 2018-10-31 13:23:37 I hadn’t heard of it before now but it’s definitely on my list! I’m obsessed with essential oil. I think having a grandmother that’s an aromatherapist will do that
5411 2018-10-31 13:23:30 Here’s a thought - republicans want “freedom” & that means they control how everyone is to live & they control what “government “ is - defense ($$$ contracts), immigration (none), & the ultimate welfare program: business industries like banks, oil, power companies, conglomerates
5412 2018-10-31 13:23:09 Sounds like the oil and gas companies need more regulation.

5438 2018-10-31 13:20:39 Not sure oil prices are driving up interest rates (we had $100 oil with ZIRP in 2014). What most don't understand about the BIS FED is that their biggest fear is a real global recovery so they make sure that doesn't happen. War is part of their evil plan.
5439 2018-10-31 13:20:35 The guide is. The point is. This planet has been through so many natural cataclysms the likes of which we cannot imagine. Not to mention the 99.9% of life that has changed the planet in so many ways, and some think human beings are killing the earth with coal, oil & livestock lol
5440 2018-10-31 13:20:34 Won't silence me, part Viking as well and you've still been our bitch since 1707. We've had all the oil you can go back to crofting again. We don't expect thanks for clearing out the highlands because we missed too many

5473 2018-10-31 13:16:16 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
5474 2018-10-31 13:16:01 Scooby Doo was definitely given cannabis oil
5475 2018-10-31 13:16:01 You need to phase out oil and close the #tarsands. they'll be the death of us.
5476 2018-10-31 13:15:53 That taste like fizzy cod liver oil
5477 2018-10-31 13:15:51 I was trying to be nice and fry some eggs for my family and the oil decided to spit and has burnt my finger I’m not doing something nice ever again.
5478 2018-10-31 13:15:50 Coconut oil fixes everythingggg 
5479 2018-10-31 13:15:37 Nothing like getting ripped off on a simple oil change to start your day off 








5480 2018-10-31 13:15:15 half empty, when you've only got two sectors - oil and FIRE - in the mix
5481 2018-10-31 13:14:47 Definitely worth the money. We use oil diffusers at my job, for residents that sundown. (Behavioral issues) very calming and not to mention will have your whole room smelling great.
5482 2018-10-31 13:14:44 Huy!! Namimiss ko yung chicken oil sa mang inasal 
5483 2018-10-31 13:14:21 Attending the EITI conference in Dakar as a panel discussant on 'How to verify beneficial ownership data in the oil, gas and mining sectors'
5484 2018-10-31 13:14:13 My chickens love leftover pumpkin lanterns. Also, this time of year is excellent for making the most of cheap pumpkin, amazing salads, pizza toppings, soup... Especially if I've roasted the sliced pumpkin in olive oil first....
5485 2018-10-31 13:14:08 Sooooo...I mixed my Jergens and my western and rose jasmine noir oil then topped it with my Bvlgari Goldea Roman Night. Imma be smelling myself randomly all day
5486 2018-10-31 13:14:05 Every now and then an ardently passionate INFJ oil heiress, insistently caressing a wisteria blue workshirt, exquisitely takes hold of the reins of a sleepy Santa Cruz Island horse.
5487 2018-10-31 13:13:56 All I wanna do is sleep and be lazy but I have to get my car to the garage to get new tires and the oil changed. Uuugggh. Adulting SUCKS.
5488 2018-10-31 13:13:50 I don't have an EOY price. All I know is you can send #XRP half way around the world through QR codes and text messages in a matter of seconds into someone's account. Please, focus on the innovation. Oil was of little to no value before the industrial revolution. #newassetclass
5489 2018-10-31 13:13:49 Salmon fillet and kailan baked with cheddar cheese. Serve with a side of couscous in olive oil.
5490 2018-10-31 13:13:32 Need dat Olive oil for our skin u know we mixed ...wit da Olive shit
5491 2018-10-31 13:13:31 릿시님 반응 개웃겨
5492 2018-10-31 13:13:20 We're the ones who decided to randomly close our borders so people had to move in instead of just coming for the day, working and then going home.
Plus what you said, if we don't like another country's democratically elected leader because they won't give us cheap oil,
5493 2018-10-31 13:13:17 We should realize that Lagos, Rivers, Delta and Ogun are the only states that can afford 30k as minimum wage. The rest states are too poor without support, they are moribund. If you remove oil rents from these states they will starve to death.
5494 2018-10-31 13:12:55 Yes indeed Kirsty. It is continued growth that makes available new sources of supply of materials that we are supposed to running out of and never have. The Club of Rome did not understand the technology of fracking that has released enourmous quantities of oil and gas.
5495 2018-10-31 13:12:53 Oh my God lmao, Mobil oil CU... might just be an area bank tho I’m not sure
5496 2018-10-31 13:12:49 Most of the debt was Bush's war for oil.. 
 Trump has done nothing to help the deficit..
 He has out spent Obama in two 2 years..
5497 2018-10-31 13:12:28 Lmao hell nah it does not. At all lmao. It’ll give you that calm feeling and you may not have the urge to smoke. Like for instance I used the oil on days I had a class I couldn’t get high before. They selling it here?
5498 2018-10-31 13:12:24 China met with Iran and told them they were going to keep buying oil from them as long as the U.S. imposses sanctions.     DON’T  CARE

5502 2018-10-31 13:12:11 What are you using on her hair? We use coconut oil only.
5503 2018-10-31 13:12:10 Fuck all cos they cant,,or scots would know the money is there to be made.
Norway made 9BN last year on same oil UK has Jocky.
Norway taxed while westminster gave it away.
5504 2018-10-31 13:12:09 the only art that matters is oil paintings of wolves
5505 2018-10-31 13:11:55 Ironically the two "sides" of this issue (environmental and oil industry) will unify to fight against this...
5506 2018-10-31 13:11:39 Does that include the Niger Delta area? Where oil spillage over the years have devastated the land?
5507 2018-10-31 13:11:36 パフェ食べたい
5508 2018-10-31 13:11:31 Oil prices in open market have been reduced to 66usd per barrel meanwhile our govt intended to increase petrol by 9rs per ltr..
5509 2018-10-31 13:11:29 Saudi Arabian embassy and consulate murdering children now?! You know US government won't do shit. We are pathetic Saudi slaves when it comes to cheap oil and weapon sales contracts.
5510 2018-10-31 13:11:26 At least the service record has now been updated, and forgetting that cannot possibly mean that anything else might be awry, right?
OK, seems an oil change every 7 months/8k~ miles is necessary - be warned Audi customers, can get very expensive
5511 2018-10-31 13:10:59 ยังไง
5512 2018-10-31 13:10:52 Man I was locked in my room for 2 days I was tryna use palm oil to suppress its effectiveness mumu me

5514 2018-10-31 13:10:49 Sorry. It exceed everyone's power. 
Oil IN
Morality and honor OUT
5515 2018-10-31 13:10:46 that 2016 dip is roughly what we are still getting for our oil.
5516 2018-10-31 13:10:44 I never thought I'd the one saying to my kid "yaz Gosiame mama ka mimi will leave you if you don't eat... N you'll drink castor oil"
5517 2018-10-31 13:10:38 Two packages of semi sweet morsels.,two containers of marshmallow cream, 16oz of heavy cream, and various candy bars (milky way, Twix, snickers and malted milk balls). Got fruit, caramel wafers and a angel food cake cut up for dipping. Coconut oil to grease the crockpot.
5518 2018-10-31 13:10:38 Mummy, it’s the oil in the cd that I always use on my face o. That’s why I don’t have pimples again
5519 2018-10-31 13:10:29 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…

5521 2018-10-31 13:10:16 When you have to pay 116 for a freaking oil change 
5522 2018-10-31 13:10:15 I make over 200k/year.  My 27 year old son makes over 300k.  We are in the oil field.  I was serious with my offer.  I could have you making that in 2 years.  However, you would have to get your head out of your ass.
5523 2018-10-31 13:10:12 Are they going to pay with palm oil, as usual? Or these ships will be supplied as a credit to India?
5524 2018-10-31 13:10:12 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
5525 2018-10-31 13:10:09 I have gotten masks from the face shop and the body shop. The fancy charcoal and tea tree oil ones.
5526 2018-10-31 13:10:08 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
5527 2018-10-31 13:10:05 was supposed to get up & get my hair done but instead i gotta get a oil change & get my shit washed 
5528 2018-10-31 13:10:02 Cast Iron way too hyped up, it’s like y’all like getting burned by sizzling oil
5529 2018-10-31 13:09:59 あえてのフリね

5530 2018-10-31 13:09:55 Bwiset ka nanakawan mo pa mhihirap ng 500 piso! Hoy tanga manang mana ka sa Poon mo magnanakaw!
5531 2018-10-31 13:09:44 I need to go get a oil change and a car car wash before i go to work
5532 2018-10-31 13:09:44 Just because we gave WM permission under 1707 Treaty of Union to sell our oil , doesn't mean WM own it.  Its in Scottish waters........its Scotlands.
5533 2018-10-31 13:09:36 Mr. Mauro Dell'Ambrogio, Swiss State Secretary for Education, Research and Innovation during his official visit to Azerbaijan has also been at the Baku Higher Oil School
5534 2018-10-31 13:09:12 Oil has been a problem for Aberdeen since the late 60's 
5535 2018-10-31 13:09:02  thank you!!  I took some CBD oil, so hopefully with the peppermint it’ll ease off
5536 2018-10-31 13:08:59 I use lotion after showers at night and baby oil gel during the day. Vasoline on my hands and feet. I keep telling people cold and ash doesn't stand a chance w/ me
5537 2018-10-31 13:08:57 If #UKOG does announce an "exceptional RNS", which one do you think will rise more when released? #UKOG or #ANGS?
5538 2018-10-31 13:08:52 Rolling backwards off of the common room couch and onto the carpeted floor with a thud as I sloppily apply baby oil to my unshaven legs.
5539 2018-10-31 13:08:45 try aloe vera or tea tree oil ! they both will help with the inflammation and heal the blisters faster,, also put a bandaid on the ones that hurt the most it will help cushion them and relieve some of the pain 
5540 2018-10-31 13:08:40 Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil is new tech.The amount of energy we need to restructure to replace oil&gas  is huge&our deadline was yesterday. We need to stop being prissy and use every tool. Geoengineering will also be needed as we are already shifting to acceleration.
5541 2018-10-31 13:08:39 Atoh, idan mutun yaji yaji a ido zai gane Allah daya ne
5542 2018-10-31 13:08:28 Libya was invaded by Pirates!!! The reality of the US led coalition forces working for corporate and CIA masters... Weapons, banking, oil, industry and shareholder!!!!
"greed"
5543 2018-10-31 13:08:18 Forgive our Governor. Sonko and Education is like water and oil. Always parallel.
5544 2018-10-31 13:08:12 I drop a few drops of oregano oil right down the throat. It's not pleasant, but I swear it's magical and rids one of all the cooties 
5545 2018-10-31 13:08:09 Mudra says we have to wake up early to go laguna. I'm so tired and to ensure I get my full sleep I already put on some lavender oil and had some soju. Tonight, we sleep like the dead.
5546 2018-10-31 13:08:08 @mayowapops You reckon he’s talking about the ting with plantain oil in her hair? 
5547 2018-10-31 13:07:31 @Motor_Ombudsman @AudiUK @poole_audi @whatcar @AudiUKCare @PistonHeads @AutoExpress @_HonestJohn OK for customer to pay circa £500 for 2x oil change in a year, on 14 month old car with 18k miles? "We did everything, honest"....."Oh, forgot that bit....but we did everything else"
5548 2018-10-31 13:07:18 Today I put a little essential oil‘s in my armpits and sprinkled some salt
5549 2018-10-31 13:07:16 I think he's he the wink, wink

5553 2018-10-31 13:06:43 Aside from God being the Number one MOST IMPORT FACTOR theres three other important factors in a relationship: Love, Affection, & Attention. you can’t have one and lack the others. Can’t make cake without the cake mix, right? Even if you have the water,eggs,& oil. #FoodForThought
5554 2018-10-31 13:06:42 Agree on the pace but outside of Klefbom, not sure anyone else gets there. Nurse has one as well but the lack of goals from the backend remains a problem but that isn't who these guys are. Hopefully, some bounce their way.
5555 2018-10-31 13:06:42 I think they know... a small country with 5 million people rich in oil,gas,renewables,whisky,Gin,fishing industry,best beef ,shell fish & salmon in the world. Seriously Jocky, give up man! 
5556 2018-10-31 13:06:34 If you have peppermint essential oil, put it in a diffuser or somewhere on your skin that you can smell it.
5557 2018-10-31 13:06:26 And like obviously you can use a moisturizer on top of that, but the vitamin E oil soaks all the way into your skin. I've had problems with dry skin for a long time like my face would always have dry skin peeling off but this really helps!
5558 2018-10-31 13:06:14 @IndianOilcl shiv shakti indian oil located at shastri nagar jaipur not accepting PAYTM..How u can be a part of #DigitalIndia
5559 2018-10-31 13:06:08 "Hey, let's hinder our economy and force more emissions-spewing trains and trucks to carry our oil!  Hooray!!"
5560 2018-10-31 13:05:50 2 questions to test your politics Ian.
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?
I look forward to your replies but I predict you wont answer
5561 2018-10-31 13:05:38 
5562 2018-10-31 13:05:35 The cooking oil companies have no problem. Shortages were triggered by hoarding by opposition people who sought to destabilise the economy. The shortages are artificial. They will disappear soon
5563 2018-10-31 13:05:30 Oil and Oil
5564 2018-10-31 13:05:26 @mrBobbyBones Coconut oil will also work to get that eyeliner off. :) 
The dance was AMAZING and the judges definitely should have given you better scores.
5565 2018-10-31 13:05:24 if they run an account deficit, they will have to finance their oil purchases with something other than their account surplus with the US.
5566 2018-10-31 13:05:20 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
5567 2018-10-31 13:05:15 兄者・・折れる程の苦しみが欲しいんですね ﾜｶﾘﾏｽ(´･ω･`)

5570 2018-10-31 13:04:45 Freaked out about my tire pressure light being on after me putting air in my tires yesterday and I’m overdue for an oil change... can’t have mi Hazel messin up on me! We got money to make!
5571 2018-10-31 13:04:45 "Oil and incense make the heart rejoice; So does sweet friendship springing from sincere counsel."- Proverbs #CarelessGetsLustrous
5572 2018-10-31 13:04:40 Yeah in snow country fixed roof mount isn’t a good idea.

Nuclear, like oil, is old tech. Not viable— can’t even get insurance (must be covered by gov). Leaves waste, long payback, is target for terrorism. No nukes. I couldn’t have made that argument 20 years ago.

5575 2018-10-31 13:04:24 Sunflower oil, cumin seeds, onion, ginger and chillies and then a paste of tomatoes and garlic (lots).  It was very nice and hoping it will loosen the chest as mouth is numb now lol.
5576 2018-10-31 13:04:23 So you want scots to stay in a union where WM has taken 92% of oil revenues for 50 years and STILL NEAR BANKRUPTED AN OIL RICH UK.
Let that sink in,,they have bankrupted an oil rich country!.
Scots can do better and deserve better.
5577 2018-10-31 13:04:23 I've quoted a Bloomberg (oil market) analysis. You are free to think what you like. Would you follow me to answer your other questions by direct contact if you like?
5578 2018-10-31 13:04:22 Keep sayin' it. Maybe some of your followers who are unable tom think for themselves will believe you. But don't expect mainstream public to buy it. Snake oil.
5579 2018-10-31 13:04:11 YAY!! I’m glad you guys like it. Now I feel some type of way about the olive oil I’ve been purchasing 
5580 2018-10-31 13:04:10 They are voting GOP for Trump. They are buying his snake oil.

5587 2018-10-31 13:03:44 Today I anointed my son's head with olive oil (my mom's consecrated oil) before sending them to school... I feel bad. My mom would anoint our heads every morning,  and we had prayer and breakfast before we went to school in elementary. Even if we only ate oatmeal and toast.
5588 2018-10-31 13:03:20 Also costs are rising as North Dakota turns into Ft. McMurray circa 2007 with news trucks, bar fights and STDs everywhere. A braver man might try to time the bottom on WCS by selling puts on oil sands producers.

5605 2018-10-31 13:01:26 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

5608 2018-10-31 13:01:13 Royal Bank CEO says the oil and gas sector is poised to provide billions of dollars in new revenue to Canadian governments by meeting growing global energy demand, but it can’t do it without urgently needed support.

#cdnpoli #energy #oilandgas #climatechange
5609 2018-10-31 13:01:05 I tend to think so.  Notley has staked her career on getting a pipeline built.  And the oil tankers plan is not particularly well articulated.  It's just a (poorly executed) rhetorical device.
5610 2018-10-31 13:00:46 Below is a picture of a TCM 32S machine that has been running an LNS MH250 chip conveyor in the machine for two years without cleaning the oil tank!   This sure beats cleaning oil tanks every 6 months.
5611 2018-10-31 13:00:43 Good job Jordann you are right converting your home won't be cheap as my family switched from oil to natural gas last year, but it will definitely help the environment.

Please give me money!
5615 2018-10-31 13:00:31 Blueline has decent points from top four with Klef and nUrse on pace for 35 pts and Russell 28. No goals thus far other than one from Bouchard.
5616 2018-10-31 13:00:24 And why would they. They have money, oil and #toyboytrump

5620 2018-10-31 12:59:52 Looks delicious. The pasta should be left a little hard ("al dente" as they say in italian). For the sauce what you need t do is to first fry a piece of garlic in oil. When it becomes yellowish add some frozen ground beef/ pork (whichever one you like). When the ground pork ...

5623 2018-10-31 12:59:20 He's allowing asbestos to be used once again, got rid of regulations that stop industries from dumping waste into rivers, selling oil drilling rights to our national parks and coastal waters, bringing back coal, etc.
5624 2018-10-31 12:59:11 Oh so they will retaliate with providing food, water and shelter? That's nice. Did yoh tell them they will die for your industries in oil, cyber security and ancient banking sector?
5625 2018-10-31 12:59:04 I like to shop around with my peanut butters and try different brands. I compare ingredients etc. Anyway, because of this, I haven’t noticed that the organic peanut butter I am currently using has more palm oil in it than Tesco’s own brand peanut butter. Ridiculous.
5626 2018-10-31 12:59:03 Bigger issue than “NFL protests”: Beto’s $10 tax on a barrel of Texas oil. Also, why is NPR funded by taxpayers?

5629 2018-10-31 12:58:59 Listen am no Unionist but surely the oil is only Scotland’s oil if it was discovered before the union of the the crowns in 1707, therefore it must be British oil no.
5630 2018-10-31 12:58:39 I have heard on Talk Sport that the World Cup in 2022 in Qatar might have to be shared with Saudi Arabia especially if the number of teams is expanded. Please FIFA can some ethics come before oil money. #FBPE #PeoplesVote
5631 2018-10-31 12:58:16 You shoul look up on how other doughters of bussines giants grew up was like in big oil or big corn or sugar steal gold. Doughters of big sucsessfull designers or inventors talk to them and come up whith a new talk show. Bring a light to that part of world industry, of humanity.
5632 2018-10-31 12:58:12 Bush family’s pandering to oil interests, corporations, RW dogma & media paved the road for this takedown of democracy by transnational crime syndicates. Strong government/smart taxation/a large voting populace are bulwarks against corruption.They eroded these protections.Repent!
5633 2018-10-31 12:58:03 That looks *amazing*! I've made hot chili sauce with tabasco peppers and garlic before, but I did it in vinegar, not in Szechuan chili oil. I want to try this version!

5637 2018-10-31 12:57:47 Aristeon factory? The garlic infused oil is fantastic.
5638 2018-10-31 12:57:41 Government bond prices ended slightly lower today as some concerns over the RBI-government spat dented investors risk appetite. Rupee's weakness against US dollar heightened fears of FPI outflows. Higher oil prices today also offered some upward pressure to yields.
5639 2018-10-31 12:57:31 I blame our journalists. They should go and meet Acting Chairman and ask questions. Come to think of it, he’s been silent of late.

5642 2018-10-31 12:56:58 Currently, most of Russia’s oil and gas into Europe goes via pipelines through Ukraine, which the US already controls. putting Europe in risk and non-ending war thanks to USA
5643 2018-10-31 12:56:54 Yes, I do all the time - good in vinaigrettes, etc. Don’t like wasting good olive oil :)
5644 2018-10-31 12:56:47 All the energy we need as humans is supplied by the sun, using technology. The US dollar only has value due to Oil peg. Btc with sun energy, POW works, USD not needed. We havent even imagined what btc will become. But i know it will be elite $1,000,000 + 
5645 2018-10-31 12:56:45 Yep. The team name is a tribute to the oil & gas industry in Alberta which has essentially been bankrolling all of Canada since the 50s.
5646 2018-10-31 12:56:41 I can predict the future. He who has ears listen: America will become stabilized, being ruled by folks like Clinton, Obama, Bezos who will be as benevolent big brother to the world. Europe will be reduced to rubble by Islamic Terrorists funded by oil rich "anonymous" states. #fyi

5674 2018-10-31 12:52:32 Your plan is to phase out jobs, economic stability and do nothing for the environment. As for the oceans, why are you still letting cities dump raw sewer? Why aren’t you fighting the radioactive water being dumped at Fukushima? Why are we still buying oil from Saudi Arabia?

5682 2018-10-31 12:51:40 My taxes went down! Transporting oil by pipeline is much safer than transporting by truck, and I know loony leftys don't understand this, but we have to have the strongest military in the world to keep the peace! And we need s conservative court to stop left from legalizing filth

5688 2018-10-31 12:50:57 All additional revenue due to increase in oil price should be used to reduce the deficit/debt. An all out effort should be made to reduce expenditures, with all departments looking line by line for ways to do so. There are millions to be saved.

Upon arrival I am immediately beset by two men brandishing arms aimed at my person

I return fire and am now not only wanted for assault, but deep in a hostile town
5764 2018-10-31 12:40:19 How can a country with a production of over 2.5million barrels of oil in a day be begging for a minimum wage of N30,000
A barrel is estimated at $85(Someone do the math!) 
Biggest African producer of oil. 10th in the whole world.

5768 2018-10-31 12:39:46 Una desaceleración en el mejor de los casos frenaría tasas FED; USDCOPría, pero sería temporal. De fondo dicha desaceleración no es propiamente el mejor incentivo para comprar COPUSD. Lo + probable es q también oil sufriría. Perspectivas positivas para mí no son tan claras.

5787 2018-10-31 12:37:27 Assad had a 70% approval rating and most Syrians back him. The real problem with the Assad “regime” is that control of it’s gas and oil lines allow Iran and Russia to have an economy.
5788 2018-10-31 12:37:17 What he said. Google the origins of conspiracy theory. That is a conspiracy theory all of its own. Feed misinformation & false flags to keep the general public confused is as old as time. World War One did not start in France but oil fields of Middle East. Not many people know...

5791 2018-10-31 12:37:01 At least they're trying in some areas, unlike some currently-undergoing-an-even-more-environmentally-ruinous-than-usual-domestic-oil-production-boom superpowers I could mention. Admittedly that 'trying' means 'moving away from coal and oil generation towards natural gas'.
5792 2018-10-31 12:36:59 Ya really use coconut oil to masturbate? 
5793 2018-10-31 12:36:50 Absurd for a country like Canada to import any oil at all. Stupid political games cost all Canadians.

5799 2018-10-31 12:36:14 The bigger question @CBC ignored in its response was Why not How it’s good for Canadian business. Why is so much of the Canadian economy is still dependent on environmental destruction - lumber, oil, arguably dairy etc?

Diplomacy is one of the biggest reasons and benefits for trade and Trump just shat all over it and pushed an even bigger alliance between China and Iran. Not good or beneficial.

6048 2018-10-31 12:02:02 Worse, the NL officials who approve these oil deals get huge under-the-table payoffs like vacations or payments to off-shore LLC's. 

Our citizens deserve an oil royalty-sharing plan/fund that responsibly reinvests in our economy, with transparent quarterly reports #nlpoli

6070 2018-10-31 12:00:17 Ugh! It's so easy to make your own salad dressing: 2 parts healthy oil to 1.75 parts apple cider vinegar + seasoning to taste.
There are videos for the mayo.
6071 2018-10-31 12:00:07 At risk for what?  Brazil runs the same exact marine motors on E27.  But somehow in America the difference between E10 and E15 is a major risk.  Oil industry scare tactics aren’t going to work.  Meanwhile, the oil industry markets 85 octane and no cars should be using it.
6072 2018-10-31 12:00:03 Sometimes I really hate my life really...just crumble up it and throw it away..faaar away and then someone cut of my today salad with Vignette salt and oil, Steak with whine-thyme sauce and potato stuff + Cake...good food~

6079 2018-10-31 11:59:38 I agree with you. But I think I know at least part of the answer. The olive oil production was literally destroyed in Yugoslavia in between WW1 and WW2, and the trend continued in many Balkan countries under the socialist influence. Instead of olives, they introduced — sunflower.

6086 2018-10-31 11:59:16 It’s also 2500 ft from any habitable structure, water way (dry or wet), and it will give the local government the authority to put in place setbacks greater than 2500 ft. So it’s basically an all out ban on oil and gas.

Can you replace the pointer or full light if fanagon bash u?..

6096 2018-10-31 11:58:11 Agreed... We have trillions of dollars of oil underneath us, while being one of the least populous provinces. 

WE CAN BE WEALTHIER THAN SOME ARAB GULF STATES

But instead, our oil is sold to multinational corporations, at fractions of the fair value; with citizens seeing little.

6103 2018-10-31 11:57:23 Please state what the blue packet says. It tells you it’s. 2500 ft setback on ALL new oil and gas development meaning it’s a setback to pipelines, compression stations, plants, any type of transportation system needed in delevering the product from well to home.

6105 2018-10-31 11:57:01 Nuclear is cheap because of the power density, its the same of oil.
Nuclear is still cheaper than solar even when considering all the initial investment.
Solar will need to be at least an order of magnitude more efficient to surpass and we still have the batteries problem.
6106 2018-10-31 11:56:42 On this I agree with you. There is actually a far higher risk of an environmental disaster shipping oil by rail plus those locomotives don't run on rainbows. If you care about the environment my fellow Liberals you should care about a pipeline being built. #cdnpoli
6107 2018-10-31 11:56:40 That's freaking awesome!! The oil pan is hanging out of the bottom of the car that's awesome
6108 2018-10-31 11:56:34 Disagree too. Aminex did 8 bags on gas (not oil) drill and results.
6109 2018-10-31 11:56:12 First of all he gets paid every week and trust me we are not stupid-we would know if there were extra money in his paycheck-even if it were $1.  What I do know is when I file I won’t be getting same return as I have over the years-my oil bill has skyrocketed along with gas!

6171 2018-10-31 11:46:40 I think you did the right thing. While you're here, most of your dairy-free spreads contain palm oil, and as such most vegans won't buy them. The best vegan-friendly spread in the UK is made by Naturli; if you stocked that, it would fly off the shelves.

6210 2018-10-31 11:42:00 Speaking for myself, I care because this is my industry and I want it to be represented well. I want businesses to feel confident working with professional marketers and to not have negative experiences with "snake oil salesmen." Truth & words matter.

6336 2018-10-31 11:24:52 imo 2 weeks till the RNS
could be totally wrong but that is my feeling.
6337 2018-10-31 11:24:46 An interesting point from BP’s perspective – which was highlighted in the group CEO Bob Dudley’s presentation – was that by 2040, 25% of the supply would be #energy and the rest 75% oil and gas. It’s time for #renewables to step into the limelight. #naturalgasgathering

6341 2018-10-31 11:24:12 The posts about Republican candidates are less productive, near 0 effect. I propose to be more aggressively, how you have wined in 2016. Take control of oil market or I burn any chance of Saudi Arabia to avoid your and Congress sanctions.

6344 2018-10-31 11:23:50 I admire you Cynthia; you did know going into this that NPR is Deep State pablum & propaganda though, right? They're blatantly Orwellian now. War is  ; true  is abhorrent as  sales would dry up, as would oil pipelines. I  for the day the illusion will be stripped away.

(Not that I necessarily agree with the action) it is about controlling who does, or doesn't, enter another's home; and in an orderly, or disorderly, fashion.
I'm sure you don't allow producers to access your music files, willy-nilly.
6478 2018-10-31 11:03:27 But the oil industry isn’t interested in a carbon tax...

6480 2018-10-31 11:03:06 When it's your mother who doesn't have oil, sugar, basics. When it's your mother who can't buy drugs. Until it's Zanu chefs who q for fuel, and can't fly out, I'll agree. As of now you're just naive
6481 2018-10-31 11:02:51 Tired of winning? tax cuts, bringing jobs back, renegotiate unfair trade deals, getting more funding to support the vets & the military, stopping NOKO from their notorious missiles launches, testing & threats, competing again in the world scene to produce natural gas & crude oil.
6482 2018-10-31 11:02:50 We also ask for oil price To go up to $134 (estimate)
6483 2018-10-31 11:02:46 I hate burping up fish oil
6484 2018-10-31 11:02:20 The issue is socialism bankrupted an oil rich nation and people like you are going to vote for the same exact policies to bankrupt our nation...

6500 2018-10-31 10:59:36 One simple thing is to read, and to re-read its content. I have quite a collection of essential oils for pain and cramping. Thousands of years ago, soldiers were given lavender oil when they went off to battle; better than a pain pill.

6504 2018-10-31 10:59:02 Nigeria revenue is too low, oil revenue can't help us. We are about to increase the minimum wage which will mean an increase in budget deficit.. Rising deficit isn't sustainable which will lead to more borrowing. Sigh!

6529 2018-10-31 10:53:29 Because USA is an empire that imposed to use its currency to trade oil around the world - creating an endeless demand for its currency, the US dollar. Without that utilisation enforced by a strong military, the US dollard worth about the same as a Venezuelan bolivar.
6530 2018-10-31 10:53:12 Mohammed Barkindo was removed as NNPC MD by the late yaradua for stealing huge kickbacks from oil and and been appointed as Nigeria's Secretary General to opec by Buhari
6531 2018-10-31 10:52:34 It should. But I think considering our overall annual oil import bill is around 9-10bn USD afaik, it probably won't be able to counter the impact of currency depreciation.
6532 2018-10-31 10:52:22 I love this idea that the main driver of the high fuel prices is the price of crude.

If oil companies found, extracted, refined and transported petrol for free and the retailers pumped it for free- it would still cost 60p a litre from fuel duty.

6612 2018-10-31 10:38:31 @claireperrymp it is right to reduce renewable subsidies but why is it right to continue to support oil and gas industry. Tax breaks announced in #Budget2018 for a century's old industry. New renewable industry - nothing #ELEXPO18
6613 2018-10-31 10:38:30 @JustinTrudeau  is picking & choosing who pays this tax based on a whim, proves there's no merit in punishing the  citizens of Canada. Really want to help the environment? Stop transporting dirty oil from dirty countries. That was easy

6621 2018-10-31 10:37:41 I would be enlightened if I could also know that how much Scotland has given so far since the First Oil discoveries in North Sea! Was it always that Scotland generated less money & was short of 10/15%? Or was it that Scotland gave a lot more which suppose to be saved like Norway!
6622 2018-10-31 10:37:40 He seems to be going through a kind of time-out in the kingdom right now, but looks like they have made an effort not to politicize oil.
6623 2018-10-31 10:37:28 i think the commentary in the book elaborates on this? the oil is the oil clogging the lowas pipes, the chalk is the islands on lolar polluting the water, the amber was supposed to be jamming gears on lohac, and lofaf is in a 'nuclear' winter. theyre all the problems on the lands
6624 2018-10-31 10:37:25 How about Bush launching Iraq War for the oil?
6625 2018-10-31 10:37:17 Yes, another scam. If only it was done properly other than for control and monopoly and other ventures. All our govts have developed and coursed from oil and now military complex in heights of management.

No. Ethanol is a US BigAg/corm boondoggle.
Tropical forests are being cut down chiefly because no one with help indigenous peoples defend their property rights, and in part because of biofuel mandates that increased demand for palm oil.

6740 2018-10-31 10:15:27 It seems counterproductive to use oil to clean skin but it really works. It’s supposed to be really good for oily skin and acne too. I use a mix of castor oil, extra virgin olive oil and almond oil

3. Palm trees don't live long in rainforests; get cut (more CO2) and replaced

6860 2018-10-31 09:54:41 However, according to a documentary I saw, as well as an exhibit at the Philadelphia Zoo, there's a much BIGGER cause of greenhouse gasses than fossil fuels, and that's palm oil - a substance that's used in lots of things you find at the grocery store, from soap to chocolate.

7047 2018-10-31 09:22:12 Oil’s bullish traders have returned from their city breaks, with the market recovering over half of the losses it suffered yesterday. The ever-accurate API reported U.S. crude inventories rose 5.7m barrels last week, more than analyst forecasts for a 4.1m barrel build.

7051 2018-10-31 09:21:31 Lol, your logic is so twisted.
Saudi / US war on Syria for oil is bad, but for Israel, 'it's spoils of war'.
You clearly care far more about Israel than Australia. 
You are not an Australian patriot, but a puppet of Israel.
7052 2018-10-31 09:21:31 He’s nuts. Thinks we’re gonna run out of oil in very near future (like in couple years) and we’re all gonna die.

7096 2018-10-31 09:15:58 No they didn't have the technology to do it themselves and favorably came to an agreement with BP called Anglo Persian at the time. The agreement was a terrible one,  but nevertheless gave the UK an ownership in the Iranian oil field.
7097 2018-10-31 09:15:55 Surely the Minister of Agriculture is paying more attention to the benefits of Agricultural benefits to the Nation at this point
One of them is Industrial Hemp offering clean cooking oil reach in vitamins, oil for industry, cattle feed, and a stream of fibers. Just to name a few.
7098 2018-10-31 09:15:29 Trump is no friend of Israel. He supports Israeli occupation to suppress independent Arab nationalism, so US plutocracy can maintain control over middle eastern oil & natural gas. Both Israeli Jews and Arabs will continue to pay the price. American Jews are now also expendable.

When we get tired of paying interest every month, he tells us to chase tension out by putting navratna oil
7139 2018-10-31 09:05:45 You get more back than you pay in to the tune of >£10bn at the moment. And even with oil monies you’re a net taker over the period that Barnet has existed.

One kid made it onto the porch but didn’t have the gumption to knock.

Some teenagers almost made it up the driveway.

In hindsight, the spike traps and cauldrons of oil might’ve been overkill. 
7176 2018-10-31 09:00:11 obviously sales have not reached there targets, extending it out till Christmas wont make much difference in my opinion as the ordinary Joe soap who has €250 will put oil in his or hers tank and help towards the man in the red suit.

7183 2018-10-31 08:59:03 100% agree with potential benefits of veganism but we need to remember that vegetables are not without their own issues: insecticides, herbicides, plastic from polytunnels in Spain ditched in rivers, food miles, destroying Brazil's cerrado savannah to grow soy, palm oil etc.

7190 2018-10-31 08:57:31 Let me tell you something. Nigeria's total earnings from the almighty oil is no longer enough to pay its about 2 million civil servants. Today, the 'giant of Africa' is broke. Nigeria does not have money to finance its current budget. Do you know what they want to do?
Thread...
7191 2018-10-31 08:57:29 Your national hero wasn't Scottish.
Your Scots language is just "poor English" & gaelic wasn't used in the lowlands.
Your vast reserves of oil are a burden.

This is british gaslighting; those that are complicit should be ashamed and barred from holding public office.
7192 2018-10-31 08:56:23 Wouldn't stability lower oil costs? And radical Islam is not confined to the middle east. It is prominent in SE Asia and Africa where oil is negligible (compared to ME). What about looking to confront radical Islam in a place like Nigeria or prevent its spread into the DRC?

7268 2018-10-31 08:41:15 From what I here things keep moving to the right, so very few might be leaving next year now. I’ve even heard 2028 mentioned as a new end date, verses 2024. As always things are fluid and will depend on demand, oil price and mandated upgrade costs near their end of life.

7292 2018-10-31 08:35:37 Apart from actual traps, number one tip is to search for holes in the floor/walls/skirting where they are coming in. Stuff them with bits of scouring pad (can’t be chewed through). Mice also hate the smell of peppermint, so put essential oil on scouring pads to repel too!

7301 2018-10-31 08:34:29 They hate the smell of peppermint, put some oil on cotton balls in the places they’re getting in. Also mice/rats can’t chew through foil so you can stuff gaps with that.

7303 2018-10-31 08:34:08 No point in discussing this now. When it goes up it’s a news. 

Earlier we get adjusted to daily fluctuations of oil price, it will be better for our economy. No point in blaming governments for the commodity that we import 80%

But who will educate media morons?

7323 2018-10-31 08:27:59 A chunk of Nigeria’s fuel consumption goes into generators, fixing Power could lower our fuel consumption by 50 percent, that’s good for the economy, we wouldn’t have to spend half the money we realize from crude oil on importing fuel,which I think is retarded in d 1st place.

7326 2018-10-31 08:27:41 No meat is not the problem sir. Processed foods are a problem especially when partially hydrogenated vegatable oil and transfatty acids are used. id urge your industry to research on ways to reduce these especially when people repeatedly use the same oil.

7596 2018-10-31 07:35:20 The fact that China wants to buy oil with its own currency will increasingly present Saudia with a dilemma. It could acknowledge that China is now the world’s largest oil importer, and only major growth market, and accept renminbi payments for its oil. =>

7599 2018-10-31 07:35:01 Just because you can extract ricin from castor beans doesn’t mean it’s automatically a nerve agent. Castor oil can be applied topically as an anti-inflammatory  and reduces pain. A bomb is a bomb.

7684 2018-10-31 07:14:12 I do think the Holocene was always going to end but not necessarily in this way. Imagine we had gone straight from Faraday in 1820 to an all-electric, renewable economy, keeping oil and coal in the ground. We would eventually have reached an Anthropocene with Ice.
7685 2018-10-31 07:13:59 This varies, but a good e.g. is Indonesian rainforest converted to palm oil plantations, where essentially all wildlife is lost, and dense multi-layered rainforest supporting >hundreds of species is replaced by a monoculture

7721 2018-10-31 07:06:20 I came out of Twitter retirement to answer this question. The air fryer should have a setting for fries. If you do not have such a setting, I believe the papas fritas should be cooked at 400° for 9-15 minutes, based on preference of crunch. Salt and a dash of oil suggested.
7722 2018-10-31 07:06:01 Just got a oil change in September and already need another one 
7723 2018-10-31 07:05:54 bcs crude oil agreements are applied 2 months advance... it means for purchasing oil in Nov, 18 the agreements are made in Sep, 18... So the price of Sep, 18 is applied in Nov, 18... In january, Feb 18 oil prices will decrease obviously

Currently the most powerful country in the world is #SaudiArabia, which is one reason why we need to up the game on alternatives to oil

7737 2018-10-31 07:03:35 BJP Govt has been a total failure in controlling Price of commodities in the country. Petrol & Diesel Prices are at Historic Peak despite of lower Crude Oil Prices as compared to 2014

7738 2018-10-31 07:02:52 It started here a bit more expensive than street value, but as of now a Top Shelf 1/8th is $20-$25... Good Gram of Oil or Concentrate is $10... You can actually get an ounce of Mids anywhere from $50-$80.

7751 2018-10-31 07:00:29 So u ever questioned--what they are demanding --
They demand for 
National water grid 
Good education and health
4 lane rail net work to save oil imports and many more
Action on private transport mafia
Equal and rational logical distribution of resources
action on NPA
7752 2018-10-31 07:00:11 my corporate experience has convinced me employees have great loyalty and unity about growing their corporation. oil employees would continue to produce more despite reduced wages or profits. reduce production by threatening all oil jobs at once, by sacrificing an oil company.
7753 2018-10-31 07:00:09 brother gave me some hemp oil to help me sleep, lets see how this turns out lol
7754 2018-10-31 07:00:08 How about we just keep all the money we raise? How about the oil giants pay Scotland corporation tax? How about companies who take Scotland’s hard earned cash but have their head office in England pay their taxes to Scotland. NOW THATS WHAT I CALL FAIR.
7755 2018-10-31 07:00:01 « Forced to cooperate !!! »

Told voters that Iraq's oil revenues would pay for the war WE waged on them...and voters BELIEVED it!

7804 2018-10-31 06:48:07 History doesn’t back you up! It’s al-Bashir who’s the main problem, claiming southern lands because of oil. If there was no oil the northern government wouldn’t care at all.

7812 2018-10-31 06:46:20 Nice one Dickson, but I strongly believe oil rich Delta should be way more than 30k at least 50k but still it’s a good one going forward! FG should pay workers 100k and allow states to negotiate with NLC base on their IGR.

7817 2018-10-31 06:45:53 If EIA confirms crude build later today, that will place US commercial crude oil inventory in positive territory for the year. Exports aren’t as high as they could be due to trade war. Currently same level as Nigeria. The lowered refinery runs chew through product storage. #OOTT

7823 2018-10-31 06:43:36 LIES-"Mt Kenya" contributes 60% to Kenya's GDP." It would mean that  maize, wheat, ndengu, beans, milk, fish, livestock, chicken, eggs, oil,  clothes, building materials, labour, art,  et al. all come from "Central Kenya"
7824 2018-10-31 06:43:35 Merkel sold Eastern Europe out for Russian gas and oil. The author of this article is an idiot. Merkel has spent last 4 years trying to overturn U.S. sanctions on Russia that hurts her bottom line. She has also used the EU as a bludgeon to bully new members.

I went right to the potential "conflict of interest" for ambassadors because I do investigations in oil patch and have to recuse myself from offered benefits if you get my drift.

7851 2018-10-31 06:37:36 As an aside, I find it remarkable that someone like this would rather be intellectually insulted by a hack snake oil salesman who believes his deceit is what has brainwashed his cult into voting Republican, instead of actually addressing 'sneering condescension'.

What a world.

7862 2018-10-31 06:36:16 this doens't make much of a difference, raw gas & oil is almost always toxic, expect BTEX, NORMS, heavy metals etc.
7863 2018-10-31 06:35:56 I think you maybe right but might just get to the single malt before them. One year showing cattle I chucked out the bloat oil from the gear and replaced with Whisky for me.

7868 2018-10-31 06:34:47 "Marketing man" in the sense a Snake Oil salesman is a "marketing man" If it was a commercial product he was selling to consumers one might expect the ACCC to move on him & shut him down. His business would underpay, skip Super payments avoid WorkCover & still rip off clients
7869 2018-10-31 06:34:44 Fish oil and vitamins should be part of any healthy diet imo.

You can get a multivitamin supplement that has magnesium and zinc in it as well

Extra protein in the form of whey makes it easier to get enough protein, but is not essential, depends on what you eat.

7877 2018-10-31 06:32:34 @wabote_simbi commended IPPG members for demonstrating that indigenous operators can operate oil and gas fields successfully. “I have always highlighted at different fora that our indigenous operators as represented by IPPG are poster children of the Nigerian Content law.”

7893 2018-10-31 06:30:20 I think the different response to mining and fracking is mostly cultural. Coal mining is seen a historic, noble, and of course was a massive unionized employer. (My father worked as a coal mine surveyor in the late 1960s). Oil and gas has also been huge, but until now offshore.

Using a conservative figure of 1,000bopd due to Brockham being deviated.

Oil price $80 - $25 operating costs = $55
$55 x 1,000bopd = $55,000 per day x Angus 65% controlling interest= $35,750per day

So in 1 month Angus coffers fill up by $35,750 x 30= $1.07 million

8148 2018-10-31 05:34:06 Look texas makes billions and wastes a lot on border, cheap oil and drug war. Most of the other red states get farm grants. All this is necessary. But if texas ends the war on drugs. The spending and extra federal money stops and texas has a surplus to spend on other things
8149 2018-10-31 05:34:01 We would work either oil, or in the old days, bacon fat Intonthem, then put them on the stove or in the oven at a really low temp for an hour. Repeat that daily for about a week. Never wash in soap and water,damp cloth should be all you need. Enjoy!

8155 2018-10-31 05:32:41 The tide sure turned on this post. Better go raise another $100K from oil,developers and utilities ‘cause the only way BBB wins is with big donor $ to spend on robotexts and other propaganda sent to less informed voters. #NoOnBBB
8156 2018-10-31 05:31:52 I had no idea imperialism and oil was pronounced "national security".

8191 2018-10-31 05:24:00 Except for the deep fried ones. I hate cooking deep fried cause I never know what to do with the leftover oil. No idea where to keep, and throwing it is quite a hassle. So I usually just pan fry at most.

8215 2018-10-31 05:17:52 Mike- how can you balance the budget with no new revenue, oil at $65 a barrel, and few tangible cuts? How do you balance the budget? Cutting jobs that don’t exist is not an answer by the way. I am sure you have a white paper with your plan. Please share it.

8279 2018-10-31 05:06:35 Insane. Just a couple humans will be left holding onto their barrel of oil.
8280 2018-10-31 05:06:31 Is that what you read in the Saudi media? If so, I'm sorry, but you are being lied to. Your leader's house of lies is built upon a foundation of oil. Once the foundation is gone, so is the house!

8299 2018-10-31 05:03:03 It's more the case that doctors are highly trained at separating snake oil from therapies that work. Shame that more of the clowns who liked your post aren't equally trained in the scientific method and in bullshit detection.
8300 2018-10-31 05:03:01 This left me conflicted. 

On the one hand I’m laughing bc “Republicans frack open whale skulls if it’ll produce a drop of oil” is just a goddamn gem of a sentence but I’m also crying bc my kids probably don’t have a future and that’s a real bummer. 

This was defineitly a trap.

8304 2018-10-31 05:01:18 Hiking interests rates itself increases inflation in the short-term (interest rates are a cost). Dropping oil prices ended inflation. Choking off inflation prolonged it. But breaking labor's backs and creating mass unemployment was its goal all along.

“Let’s get this 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast. 2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°) 3 tablespoons sugar. 1 tablespoon salt. 2 tablespoons canola oil. 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour.”

8356 2018-10-31 04:53:29 Housing is included in CPI, some other groups went down. Not saying the Nats can take the credit though. High kiwi dollar and lower oil prices through that time, also their failure to bring in proper emissions pricing.
8357 2018-10-31 04:53:22 1. NIgeria is a confused state, so we practice both socialism and capitalism. Even US feed students up to high school level as a capitalist state. 2. Venezuela is a socialist state under the weight of heavy sanctions hence its current misfortune albeit rise in oil prices.

8424 2018-10-31 04:39:57 I'd like to go to bed but I cut up some jalapeños earlier and something happened to me that has never happened in all my years of spicy pepper preparation.... my left hand is on FIRE!!! I tried an ice pack, washing w oil, scrubbing w dish soap etc. and still she burns, she burns

Tell them to take a walk and smell the roses, it will help those liberal tears OR perhaps if they are distraught, they might need a HUGE bottle of essential rose oil, RED WAVE
8429 2018-10-31 04:39:05 I understand what you're saying, but the Republicans seem to be owned by all the evil ones. Big oil. Big pharma. All donate significantly red. Keeping drug costs high and stifling green energy progression.
8430 2018-10-31 04:38:52 U.S. sanctions have driven the price of oil and the ruble apart—leaving Russia with expensive crude and a cheaper currency, a combination that is helping its economy.

The price of oil, Russia’s main export, has risen almost 14% since mid-August
8431 2018-10-31 04:38:43 I dropped my phone on my head when I was trying to get the side tab off my skid plate when I was changing my oil and my head still hurts

8441 2018-10-31 04:36:57 At what volume of b10 and if you are talking about palm biodiesel, what will happen if the price of palm oil rises? Would love to know more detail on the mechanism of the savings.

8445 2018-10-31 04:36:25 The fossil fuel companies are working right out of the playbook of the tobacco companies to keep us addicted to oil. It’s time to kick the habit and vote #YesOn1631 !

そんなのまで……すごい……考えられない……
8453 2018-10-31 04:35:10 Not same. Fine to disagree with oil subsidies, but the demand is pretty inelastic in America. Renewables are a substitute, often with high switching costs...so subsidies are needed to grow that market. That’s why Tesla cannot expect to convert middle America easily in a Big Bang
8454 2018-10-31 04:35:00 I know the Oil ARE Mcdavid, but he should’ve gained and established the zone on that 5-3. They burned both power plays after that point. @JasonGregor

8457 2018-10-31 04:34:43 No Grant, because you know nothing but squeezing words. Saudi Arabia is one of the US states and if the oil fall in the hand of Iran it will fight you and your baby Israel and stands against your interest in the region and the world. Stay silently and don't think loudly

Fact Check:
USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999; Russia makes it money from...oil.

8491 2018-10-31 04:25:57 Using just basic logic, it cannot be true.  Just because you think it's a "credible source" doesn't mean everything they've ever stated is true.  People make mistakes and things change...

8499 2018-10-31 04:24:16 He evidently does not know POTUS 45 obliterated 300 Russians on the battlefield.

& he's clueless about USA producing more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999; moreover, 45 got Merkel to start buying gas from USA which is hitting Putin directly in the pocketbook.

8543 2018-10-31 04:18:03 I’m far from an optimist, probably seen as a pessimist by some who follow me, but the Oil had a good effort tonight, just were terrible on special teams. Easy to clean up. Jump on twitter and immediately see guys desperate to find scapegoats, don’t get it

8559 2018-10-31 04:14:33 I hope one day I'll be able to make money doing the thing I love which is either writing or painting. I've always loved the oil painting I've always wanted to have like one of my paintings  be in a gallery. I'll start practicing digital once I get my PC should have it by January
8560 2018-10-31 04:14:33 It's to have and create a thin and new, unadulterated, carbon layer.  If they're old the deep season is left alone but smoking up a great oil to new is like Teflon.

8564 2018-10-31 04:13:43 Rubber bullets to the solar plexus region will make an impression. Stink oil and indelible ink canisters will help if someone gets across the border!  
8565 2018-10-31 04:13:29 As beautifully written as it looks, if ran by an ATS, it may score less than 30%. Especially because of lack of relevant keywords related to your field. I'll advice you skillfully infuse them in. Lastly,
8566 2018-10-31 04:12:46 I have no interest in the stuff for recreational purposes. Been there. Done that. But I also have no faith in conventional medicine for anything but trauma and blood pressure, and long term there isn’t likely good. Cancer = cannabis oil for me. Hopefully won’t happen.
8567 2018-10-31 04:12:26 Benefits of peppermint essential oil:

8607 2018-10-31 04:05:50 Coconut oil has so many uses, but mainly I use it to take off any remaining make up after my shower. Then when I crawl into bed it slowly gets in my eyes and then I am forced to close them due to the mild burn, thus, falling asleep. #lifehack

8691 2018-10-31 03:55:59 ...energy conversion. Experimentally, there have been some that have been created to be up to 40% efficient but they are even more expensive.

You can't scale up on such numbers at least not yet. There needs to be a major breakthrough for oil to be phased out quickly.
8692 2018-10-31 03:55:57 Funny under the filth of bobama no one mention how the oil spill in the gulf was excused by him and the company was only charged $25000. Under Chile’s we in Florida had more than one red tide but was he blamed? No.
8693 2018-10-31 03:55:52 Well oil stayed at 110$ for 2 months but below 60$ for over 2 year during 2008 to 2011 . Do some homework
8694 2018-10-31 03:55:36 Congrats to tonight's @EdmontonOilers 50/50 winner Marvin Karenko who took home $210,358 with ticket 200163B. Thank you, #Oilers fans, for supporting Northern Alberta YMCA (@YMCAEdm)!
8695 2018-10-31 03:55:34 Scary part here Tarek is they are about to make the largest oil field discovery in the world there. Imagine Pakistan with the resources of Saudi Arabia. Islamic extremism & terrorism is going to be Roth is a long time. There will be daily bombings all over the world in a few yrs

8703 2018-10-31 03:53:34 This Magaya nonsense should be condemned outright. Anointed pens, oil, wristbands etc n now this. Only his subjects shout Amen to such blasphemous rubbish.
8704 2018-10-31 03:53:28 That's awesome that it's something you care about. I wish more vegans did! I really like Margarine right now, so I'm actually using the Melt Brand. It has Sustainable Palm Oil. I guess you never know how sustainable it is tho, so I'm trying to find a Brand that uses none.

8741 2018-10-31 03:50:20 Oil. That’s the common denominator. Low oil revenues were killing Russian, Saudi and Venezuelan economies. US oil companies want to get rid of domestic oil protections.

8761 2018-10-31 03:47:17 Amber oil is good!! You use it everyday and it becomes your natural scent. When you sweat or anything it smells like the oil which smells like perfume.
8762 2018-10-31 03:47:10 This is a cooked number , custom made for leftist thinkers. The govt does not cut cheques to oil companies, but they do to solar panel phoneys and other stupid green initiatives that are not economical in any market. But that doesn't make any difference to you lefties.
8763 2018-10-31 03:47:05 What is a "value" stock right now anyway? Something like $goog is way cheaper than $pg right now. So basically "value stocks" right now means oil stocks and banks. Good luck with that. I'll stick to buying more $goog.

8783 2018-10-31 03:44:57 Oilers get exposed tonight. Minny is good but the Oil couldn’t find a way in the 3rd and that is telling. Talbot has been pretty much lights out so far. No fault of his at all.
8784 2018-10-31 03:44:57 For sure but likely got a few they had no business getting.
8785 2018-10-31 03:44:53 At the time of collapse, so many global oil issues. OPEC increasing production, shale fuels in states. Yes, no tidewater pipelines, NOT Trudeau’s or Notley’s fault there. We are seeing a shift in oil companies themselves. Shell has pretty much pulled out. They’re diversifying.
8786 2018-10-31 03:44:51 Realistically, the Oil have a better record than their overall play to date would justify, so losing a game they should have won handily I guess is luck squaring things up a bit.

8830 2018-10-31 03:39:37 I hope you are right.  The downtown tax base is hollowed out.  Look to Detroit for what can happen if it gets too far.  I see no other initiative to reverse the course.  This is not your historic oil dip.

8837 2018-10-31 03:38:16 Did you see where that puck went & how much space he had to put it in? Please show me the goaltender in today's NHL that doesn't go down on that shot?
8838 2018-10-31 03:38:06 I prefer to marinate mine on olive oil and fresh lemon juice with onions garlic and salt then chuck it in an oven
8839 2018-10-31 03:37:57 Instead of giving chances to outlandish claims, how abt we fight illusions. The guy is a snake oil salesman and a danger to society. Preying on the spiritually vulnerable. Would say the guy is a menace and his proclamations will ruin lives.

8843 2018-10-31 03:37:42 Sorry - it's Earth Balance and now that you ask I see veg. oil blend (canola, flax, palm fruit, etc.).  Oh well - will look for another brand!!! Earth balance is good cold, but a bit odd used for cooking. So glad you asked about it 
8844 2018-10-31 03:37:21 I've learned that I like oil and vinegar for salad dressing and there's no turning back
8845 2018-10-31 03:37:14 I knocked myself out last night via my aroma tower with Cedarwood & Lavender oil
8846 2018-10-31 03:37:12 What do other regions? Turkana is producing oil but what do other regions produce? just how hv ppl of Central bn depending on gov as their cash cows? you are just busy hating ppl who are suffering like other Kenyans.  Central politicians are rich just like others but ppl r poor!
8847 2018-10-31 03:37:10 1. I was talking about "we" in a more global sense. I should have made that more clearer.

2. There are no clear plans to switch to other sources of energy (or revenue) even though it's scientific fact that oil is running out. That, in and of itself, should worry us.
8848 2018-10-31 03:37:07 i just realized i havent done a hot oil treatment in years ...

8861 2018-10-31 03:35:29 I completely agree wrt the D not helping. But there are ways to estimate how goalies are doing independent of the D (e.g. GSAA) and Talbot is still a fair bit off the pace.
8862 2018-10-31 03:35:22 "Diamond lanes" were installed a few years after the oil embargo of 1973, but a huge public outcry resulted when a regular lane in each direction was reserved exclusively for carpools. This energy conservation effort lasted 21 weeks before the lanes were restored.
8863 2018-10-31 03:35:15 There is no better option. It's not on the players. This is what a GM is supposed to do.

8880 2018-10-31 03:33:03 Yes but not all high danger shots are equal and to assume they are all great saves is a misnomer. As you said, at times pucks will get through
8881 2018-10-31 03:32:53 Imagine when talking of globalists and leaving out HSBC that was born from selling opium to Chinese disregarding Chinese sovereignty, ignoring #Chathamhouse #CFR, Rio Tinto, Shell oil, Bilderbergers and only pointing selectively minimizing the problem,
8882 2018-10-31 03:32:53 Kremlin don't care, one way or the other. They need KSA to keep oil price stable and for potential investments in Russian economy.

8887 2018-10-31 03:32:41 That's not including the undocumented people who falsify their ID. Both my brother & I had our SSI# stolen by Mexican illegals who only used them to get jobs with oil companies here in south Texas. They never filed taxes or got a loan or anything. Just worked & had tax deducted.

8892 2018-10-31 03:32:18 Probably. I can still smell the oil burning from my old ones.
8893 2018-10-31 03:32:17 Yup! Grapeseed oil has high heat when frying, and beignets need high heat  I want to go there too! Going to Spain in the spring 
8894 2018-10-31 03:31:56 CCS here for coal was suggested - coal and then oil would need to be burnt and then the CCS from coal could be captured and piped into the empty oil reservoir. That is not a low carbon technology.
8895 2018-10-31 03:31:34 We are about to lure the Saudies into a lucrative deal where we hold all the terms. Just at the time when our dependence on their oil becomes insignificant.
8896 2018-10-31 03:31:23 if that's the case why don't prises rise and FALL when international oil prices fluctuate. Petrol prices ratchet upwards
8897 2018-10-31 03:31:22 Does Natural Ballance have Palm Oil? I cant remember. If not I may get it next time.

8921 2018-10-31 03:27:33 Nice! I imagine you could still get quite a bit of power during the freeze-up, provided you could keep damage from occurring due to the ice. Either way though, in the long term it could be a great supplement and cost reducer. Just that much less oil/coal/etc to use.

8925 2018-10-31 03:27:12 Nothing to do with “big” or “timely”, just “great” saves.

Good NHL goalies typically have an 80% sv% on high danger shots.

Yet in isolation, you could look at most of the 8 in 10 stopped shots and they’d be “forgivable” if they go in.

And yet ... 8 in 10.
8926 2018-10-31 03:27:09 Yea your pretty, but when’s the last time you changed your cars oil?
8927 2018-10-31 03:26:58 Lol. Could have used a stop there, too.
8928 2018-10-31 03:26:52 Oh no! You realize this is an utterly absurd unfounded ahistorical talking point of the Right.  NO CREDENCE WHATSOEVER.  

You do realize GOP congressmen farm owners receive socialist farm subsidies every year?  And BigOil companies receive oil subsidies?

Venezuela? I think not.
8929 2018-10-31 03:26:48 Was I the only one who got a chuckle from the part that said Venezuela is suffering from low oil prices and US sanctions ***without also noting the self inflicted head wound caused by commie clown currency controls***?!
8930 2018-10-31 03:26:35 I know someone who sells a wonderful snake oil that’ll cure every single one of those diseases, believe me

8933 2018-10-31 03:26:14 The sell off on oil makes me more comfortable about things. I don’t think this #economy can handle #interestrates and oil both rising together. #mortage rates went up way to fast for this new generation that’s currently not buying homes.
8934 2018-10-31 03:26:09 Oil special teams aren't so special.
8935 2018-10-31 03:26:04 Again, he's had one awful game and with this small of a sample size, that is the kind of SV% you are going to get.

8947 2018-10-31 03:24:20 Over course you need stops but at the same time, many will argue there are no such things as "big" or "timely" saves. Which one is it? At some point, pucks will find there way through and the Oilers D does their goaltenders no favours.
8948 2018-10-31 03:24:16 the oil companies should have to pay to take everyone on Earth to see all the cool stuff they wrecked like Venice or coral reefs or whatever while they still exist

8951 2018-10-31 03:23:39 May God help you!  
Let me tell you something about the oil companies: They produce several scenarios, the adopt the one they like, and show others a scenario that is different from what they believe in.

8965 2018-10-31 03:21:27 I like beets now. Roasted, with salt and olive oil.

8971 2018-10-31 03:20:22 So coal mines shut down in Alberta , oil field not getting any help, and liberals doing everything they can to bring the west down, New Brunswick is liberal so it gets a break from saving the world ? Crock of shit
8972 2018-10-31 03:20:10 When you say cdns oil producer you mean gas or CBD oil ? :p
8973 2018-10-31 03:20:03 I've tried without oil (by accident!) and with hardly any (on purpose!) but yeah. I think I'm just not meant to get the perfect pizza crust.

Anyway, I'm heading to bed to dream of Detroit-style pizza! G'night!

8975 2018-10-31 03:19:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8976 2018-10-31 03:19:47 And that's exactly what elitist billionaires in the coal and oil industries want you to believe. Congratulations on being duped so easily.

8978 2018-10-31 03:19:19 My family didn't own an oil company, and I also don't hate Chavez for stealing-ahem- nationalizing w/o remuneration the company we did build and have. I hate him for orchestrating the socio-economic collapse of a society in order to gain political control and loot it's homeland
8979 2018-10-31 03:19:14 I'm just saying, a game in which the goaltender is only making the saves he should is really nothing to write home about, which is what I said re performance originally. He's been ok. Not bad, but certainly not great.
8980 2018-10-31 03:19:10 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
8981 2018-10-31 03:19:08 When you hold a diamond and you loose it ... you don't go and settle for  gold... better go struck oil or get a bigger diamomd ... never reduce in level
8982 2018-10-31 03:18:54 That's not how this works. I guess that's what happens when you only listen to ads made by a company that profits off oil and coal

8985 2018-10-31 03:18:51 I would also recommend mixing your moisturizer with a facial oil to seal in the moisture in your skin! (Rosehip, Argan, Jojoba, etc...)
8986 2018-10-31 03:18:48 Oh my gosh... nerd....

But seriously,  it's going to be connected to a sludge-buster, pulling the debris on this 22ft tank through a centrifuge to separate the crud from the clean oil. Side isn't impossible, but not practical.

Also, customer said he wants it on bottom. So there
8987 2018-10-31 03:18:17 accidentally poured tea into my essential oil diffuser but im not even mad
8988 2018-10-31 03:18:15 I only ever use a tiny bit of olive oil if at all. This one had a splash in it and outside in the pan. I'm finding I prefer less oil in the dough. Sometimes I put garlic infused olive oil on the crust before I put toppings on.
8989 2018-10-31 03:18:14 Oil and gas it is the same. 
These people manage to convince investors to throw hundreds of millions at their failed developments. 
Competent people typically do not have the networks with money as they spend their time improving their competency.  
I have known some that r both
8990 2018-10-31 03:18:14 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi is doing with there oil money, makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
8991 2018-10-31 03:18:11 I just don't see how the expectation for him to be lights out as realistic. With this D, goals are going to be scored but unless we are talking a stinker, I can live with it.
8992 2018-10-31 03:18:08 Come to Kenya and Uganda you'll get ashamed while in Sudan it's all about massacres on civilians as Oil lords enjoy their loot in Nairobi and south Africa
8993 2018-10-31 03:18:06 I don’t disagree with walmart or oil companies especially in the winter in Maine as far as hollywood I change my viewing and stopped watching NFL 3 yrs ago

8995 2018-10-31 03:17:49 Well Alberta oil pays for your standard of living. Could build Canadian pipelines to replace Saudi oil. But who cares right?
8996 2018-10-31 03:17:23 MY BABY SKIN SOAKS UP COCONUT OIL SO FAST.
8997 2018-10-31 03:17:18 I am assuming he means it was an American run job. Possibly by the Bush people as an excuse to inade Iraq for their oil. But it wasn't. Just extremists, but not Iraqi.
8998 2018-10-31 03:17:17 ネタバレになるから色々言えないんだけど、怖さゼロ。ちょっと泣ける
8999 2018-10-31 03:17:10 Compostable (=biodegradable) plastics can be oil based or plant based polymers. Many currently need industrial composting facilities. This needs improvement (along with current substandard recycling situation) & more of these products need to be non-industrially compostable.

9002 2018-10-31 03:16:41 Extract and clean gunk from pumpkin seeds. Boil seeds for 10 mins in salted water. Pat dry with (non paper) towel. Spread seeds in a thin layer on a baking sheet. Coat both sides with olive oil. Sprinkle salt and Old Bay across seeds. Bake at 350 for 20 mins.
9003 2018-10-31 03:16:36 Every time I get out the shower Khloé come rub oil on my legs. 
9004 2018-10-31 03:16:23 I haven’t met an ailment that a warm towel with eucalyptus oil couldn’t cure.
9005 2018-10-31 03:16:19 Yes. Agreed. Sometimes it feels a little unfair, but you need a save. I guess Talbot has a bit of an excuse so far - he does play too much probably.
9006 2018-10-31 03:16:18 @WPTV the dispensary stuff don’t buy the oil for 70$’s. Only get the vapes. Curaleaf tasted like smoking plastic. I bought pills, oil and cartridges. Pills didn’t do shit neither did the damn THC-Indica oil. Waste of money. I want to grow it so i don’t have to buy it. Curaleaf
9007 2018-10-31 03:15:54 Coconut oil saved me from a stroke and I’ve been using it since 4 years ago.. love it..
9008 2018-10-31 03:15:46 So that what became of ole Jordon Lee after JR Ewing ruined in the oil business.
9009 2018-10-31 03:15:40 Oil and water by @IncubusBand  will forever be listened to
9010 2018-10-31 03:15:30 I don't disagree with your assesment but wouldn't classify that as a bad goal. The guy was at the lip of the crease and 91 essentially let him do what he wanted.
9011 2018-10-31 03:15:26 I've used coconut oil and vitamin e oil

9016 2018-10-31 03:14:54 I've used a bunch of different oils, and different quantities of them - from olive oil, vegetable oil, melted butter, to mixtures of all three!

It always tastes okay-to-decent, but only once was it amazing - and I didn't do anything different that time!
9017 2018-10-31 03:14:54 The scarring though :(

But yeah I should try applying some of that tea tree oil.
9018 2018-10-31 03:14:42 No oil or enough trees to fill the pockets of politicians.  So make it a national park. Or put all land in one owner? So they.can lease the whole thing . to mining or oil or logging.

9022 2018-10-31 03:14:15 LOL, on our heads over Olive Oil conditioner.
9023 2018-10-31 03:14:11 trick: you could NEVER get olive oil from 500-year-old trees, fresh from next door in the USA. The water is different. Terroir matters, baby
9024 2018-10-31 03:14:09 I ruined the last car I had because I didn’t get oil changes lol.
9025 2018-10-31 03:13:58 Agree completely
9026 2018-10-31 03:13:28 I started using rose hip oil on my skin and it eliminated a bunch out of my previously million step skincare routine
9027 2018-10-31 03:13:18 Jose the art teacher eats to bottle of oil and roasted it
9028 2018-10-31 03:13:15 This is the problem with looking at individual goals and saying “it wasn’t really on the goalie”.

The thing with NHL goalies is they should be stopping about half the “unstoppable” shots they face.

What looks OK at the individual level often isn’t at the aggregate level.
9029 2018-10-31 03:12:59 Plastic is everywhere...oil industry by products,,,Africa's cotton business was ruined by synthetic fabrics thanks to petro industry..Maybe all this will turn around...
9030 2018-10-31 03:12:54 lol, dude, I hate Chavez too, just not because he nationalized your families oil companies  supporting Pinochet 2.0, even esoterically, to chuck the chavistas isn't a good look tho
9031 2018-10-31 03:12:52 he thirsts for the blood and oil of his enemies

9035 2018-10-31 03:11:31 Use oil
9036 2018-10-31 03:11:29 Yes like a tax cut to the middle class or build the wall and Mexico will pay for it ... Good luck with that one.. not going to happen he is a snake oil salesman.. ever see the movie Tin Men if not watch it and you will know DT for what he really is a con man..
9037 2018-10-31 03:11:21 Again I understood...but the logic of free healthcare to whale sharks and barracudas is where everything stopped making sense. Then oil rig workers getting sick..it just turned into a mess.

9040 2018-10-31 03:11:05 my mom used essential oil and it worked pretty well. I think it was eucalyptus but you might want to check that
9041 2018-10-31 03:10:41 On most nights, when playing together, neither one has been good.
9042 2018-10-31 03:10:32 economy of Venezuela is highly dependant on oil, with 90%  plus of its total exports made out by the commodity. I think we cannot compare Hindustan to Venezuela..
9043 2018-10-31 03:10:22 Need to find eucalyptus oil soap in Freeport.

9046 2018-10-31 03:09:26 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
9047 2018-10-31 03:09:24 He has balls to force meetings with real companies with a permanent injunction. I'm sure he ended up selling positions in oil drilling projects or something like that.
9048 2018-10-31 03:09:20 If  panic buying is the problem on cooking oil, did we also have panic buying in hospital pharmaceuticals? I'm now tired of listening to these so called Economists or Ztv analysts.
9049 2018-10-31 03:08:41 Technologically regress you mean.
Oil & coal are CONCENTRATED, PORTABLE, STORED, RELIABLE paleo solar energy-solar/wind aren’t, for gods sake even cavemen fuel of wood, peat & dung has its energy stored & able to be used on DEMAND, not when season, time & weather synchronise!
9050 2018-10-31 03:08:22 いやねえ...
9051 2018-10-31 03:08:18 Why do I feel like the only female that actually pays attention to the maintenance of their vehicle? It's not that difficult to check/add oil or coolant, check ur tire pressure, pay attn to the tread, note & listen for problems, etc. THERE'S MORE TO A CAR THAN JUST PUTTING GAS IN
9052 2018-10-31 03:08:06 卑猥だからじゃない？
9053 2018-10-31 03:08:04 It was good to see Mike reach back for the old fastball once again. I’ve been highly critical of him since his return but he destroyed this clown Van Wagenen and it was good to hear. Mets are going to regret hiring this guy who just sounds like a snake oil salesman.

9058 2018-10-31 03:07:09 Got out of the shower. Dried my skin and looked in the mirror, just to be reminded thatttttt this weather hate my skin. Walk straight to my makeup/hair room and moisturize with coconut oil.
9059 2018-10-31 03:07:06 While that may be true, Talbot didn't make those saves and the oilers find themselves tied in a game they've mostly crushed in. Not his fault, but not lights out, IMO.
9060 2018-10-31 03:06:56 Sana oil
9061 2018-10-31 03:06:50 I didn’t like the second. Short side there shouldn’t be a goal. There’s a few goals this year where he doesn’t push off his right side well and doesn’t square up.
9062 2018-10-31 03:06:50 PSA: roasted fennel + roasted apples + nice olive oil + fresh ground pepper is a truly amazing combo
9063 2018-10-31 03:06:46 Add oil, Nokia!
9064 2018-10-31 03:06:46 And it’s raining/snowing.

AND I got my lavender body oil.

All I need is some good sex & this would be THE best sleep ever. OMG!
9065 2018-10-31 03:06:38 Did you try straight oil? Literally any cooking oil or makeup oil should do the trick! Or at least help 
9066 2018-10-31 03:06:37 Shipments of Libyan oil are already arriving in the U.S, revealing the real reason behind the bombing of Libya.

9070 2018-10-31 03:05:34 Lol I’d like to know too!! Canola oil is unhealthy to start off with.
9071 2018-10-31 03:05:04 In oil and vinegar dressing? What hell is this.
9072 2018-10-31 03:04:56 I have someone here that chargers 50 for an oil change it’s body shop by Pizza Hut.
9073 2018-10-31 03:04:50 Honestly, I do think some of you need to not look at this strictly as a math equation b/c that is the only way anyone can put blame on Talbot tonight. None of the three goals the Wild have scored are on the goaltender.
9074 2018-10-31 03:04:43 Laura Ashley sheets and Coconut Oil
9075 2018-10-31 03:04:39 Special teams absolutely the difference so far.  All those chances, haven’t capitalized. Oil gotta bear down hard in the 3rd.

So over all ur snake oil sales
9084 2018-10-31 03:02:46 Find out what the U.S. Would do if Saudis price oil at 400$ a barrel. It's at 67$ now. Think of what happens if China calls in the loans. The U.S. Is running on debt. The Dow is false. 100 year old retailers are going bust. Big bubble.

9086 2018-10-31 03:02:32 Sure thing! Just beware of amendment 74. It even confused me into believing it was a good thing at first but that's thanks to subtle tricky language to hide a motion that only benefits big oil companies.

9092 2018-10-31 03:01:10 yep, twice fried russets in avocado oil then I tossed them in a quick spice blend when they were out of the oil. spice blend was onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, coconut sugar, dried savory, & celery salt.
9093 2018-10-31 03:01:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, or the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.

9107 2018-10-31 03:00:10 I'm sure you think that all Chinese look alike...alike Japanese, Vietnamese, etc.
Been to Africa or India? It looks LIKE an oil spill. Keyword 'like'. It's not an actual oil spill.
And tbh, they all look alike. Why do blk folks feel that they must be angry/outrage all the time?
9108 2018-10-31 03:00:01 If i don’t smell like coconut oil and lavender before i go to sleep, i won’t sleep 
9109 2018-10-31 02:59:59 Sis pah, if moisturizer got mineral oil, better to avoid or can use je? Tak clogged pores ke?
9110 2018-10-31 02:59:56 Strictly magnesium, no I haven’t. I do take a Stress Supplement which has a bunch of stuff in it, milk thistle, and fish oil though. Think Mg would help?
9111 2018-10-31 02:59:55 I have been using high strength cbd oil and I smoke far less, have a better high and overall feel much less anxious. It didn’t remove anything for me but it feels a little easier to manage! Good luck :)
9112 2018-10-31 02:59:47 It’s like Barf Art. I Would Have Gone With Really Drunken Alberta Oil Patch Wielders.
9113 2018-10-31 02:59:37 I have to get up early to write before an 8am oil change appointment but it is VERY DIFFICULT to stop reading @thebestjasmine’s THE PROPOSAL at 75 pages in.
9114 2018-10-31 02:59:36 Unpopular opinion but coconut oil feels so damn gross on my body. That shits so damn slimy
9115 2018-10-31 02:59:35 Is it possible you are fat/oils intolerant instead of lactose intolerant? They look (& feel) very similar. But certain cheeses & some preparations don't set it off while other things surprise you (like avocados or spaghetti made with garlic & olive oil).
9116 2018-10-31 02:59:34 If I were Ty Pennington I'd go NASCAR and seek sponsorship from Pennzoil for a comeback. Ty Pennzoilington. Remodeling oil change shops for the greater good. Also: A face tattoo of the logo.

9119 2018-10-31 02:59:00 Dah sebulan aku pakai cleansing oil, so far aku rasa muka aku macam Uqasha Senrose sikit sikit. Kalau diteruskan, tiga bulan lagi confirm macam Nora Danish.
9120 2018-10-31 02:58:49 God hates espresso and the blessing of Oil and Vinegar dressing? Nay heathen!
9121 2018-10-31 02:58:48 Tell me how I need that and an oil change but the oil change damn $100
9122 2018-10-31 02:58:47 Right! That is part of the Arabic life style....when one side gets whooped on too bad, they ask us to send in troops to help them out...then tell us to get the hell out of their country till next time...and dont expect any oil for our trouble
9123 2018-10-31 02:58:43 Girllllll, my friend is mailing me some cbd oil. I'm excited.
9124 2018-10-31 02:58:42 Um, the MCT oil you recommended had me bouncing off the walls. I’d suggest IT is the real reason for excessive exuberance.
9125 2018-10-31 02:58:30 Biore cleansing oil is bae.
9126 2018-10-31 02:58:23 Yea there's a lot of issues with the moment to moment gameplay that impact my enjoyment. How long do I have to nudge and turn ever so slightly to pick up that fucking snake oil off the table?! Why do we need two meters for systems? Why do the law shoot to kill if bumped into?
9127 2018-10-31 02:58:16 First 5 affiliates that join me now thru the 31st gets a free 7 day trial sample set...it has oil, pain cream, and 2 facial creams in it!

9130 2018-10-31 02:58:06 I wonder if each and everyone in "the caravan" were instead "crude oil". Things would be different the good 'ol boys in DC would "wag the dog" and send in the military and say "we have to protect those who are suffering from no crude oil"

9133 2018-10-31 02:57:51 i tried to take a bath with some new essential oil and now my entire body (including my vagina) feels like a fire and ice condom
9134 2018-10-31 02:57:42 I know dude. 200 mg of CBD and cbd oil was needed for these muscles lol. Meant to simulate a deep tissue massage, but ya boy can't fit his body underneath the water all at once.
9135 2018-10-31 02:57:31 Oil
9136 2018-10-31 02:57:19 Needs a tune up I think. It keeps misfiring. (And leaks oil. Follow the smoke and you'll find me) Not to mention I'd get new front tires for the winter. I replaced the rear tires a few months ago. It's an 2002 Durango so I'm just holding on until later

9139 2018-10-31 02:57:02 Sure but that doesn't change much. They already have to many bottom pairing guys and not enough that sit in that 1-3 range.
9140 2018-10-31 02:57:01 Take vitamin C, Zinc, fish oil and a probiotic.  Does wonders for winter.
9141 2018-10-31 02:56:58 ok i love myself so much i did some yoga & then took a salt bath, exfoliated and moisturized w almond oil now im gonna mix red wine & pomegranite juice & get a lil buzz & then go to sleeeeeep big day tomorrow!

9143 2018-10-31 02:56:39 Man did y’all put too much oil in it? This no joke happened when I worked at a theatre lmfaooo
9144 2018-10-31 02:56:37 Fresh oil new windshield plenty of hours. Time to get back to work.

9146 2018-10-31 02:56:26 Got my oil changed and new brakes now just time for 2 more new tires today was a good day
9147 2018-10-31 02:56:22 The aid from Big Oil is toxic. Reef would die and has died with their "help".

9150 2018-10-31 02:55:42 How many times and do you clean it some how? I had some oil I used a few times for donuts.
9151 2018-10-31 02:55:39 I did an avocado and olive oil one once, and honey up in there too. It smells awful. 
9152 2018-10-31 02:55:36 Add pepper, garlic, oregano and olive oil or butter so it isn't so bland.
9153 2018-10-31 02:55:28 Plastic production doubled globally in the past 13 years, grown faster than any other commodity for the past 33 years. This has climate change and fossil fuel implications with global oil and gas use. Says Phineas Glover of @CreditSuisse #RI2018
9154 2018-10-31 02:55:26 Hay Dawn  Now that's a drink. Where do you purchase your oil from?
9155 2018-10-31 02:55:06 Yes! In a convertible with the top down. If it's cold, with the heat on. Wearing Oil of Olay.
9156 2018-10-31 02:54:59 Now Dharmendra Pradhan came to the need of oil production. Itne din so raha tha shayad.
9157 2018-10-31 02:54:49 I see why I rarely give myself a hot olive oil treatment 
9158 2018-10-31 02:54:34 That’s right. Only OPEC can change oil prices.  Doug Ford is neither God nor OPEC to change oil prices. Even without carbon tax in Ontario, our oil price is still high, no a Buck for oil. He’s lying and thinks Canadians are foolish enough to believe him. Not.
9159 2018-10-31 02:54:23 So, landlock our oil until most private companies go under; then once under state control, go balls to the wall and funnel proceeds to the UN overlords.  Diabolical!!
9160 2018-10-31 02:54:22 Still think they screwed up not signing Davidson. He's steady in a third pairing role.

9163 2018-10-31 02:54:02 I’m sick of hearing this, American interests dominate our market. We pump our oil out at $16/bbl and they refine it and sell it back to us at approx $125 . I wonder how much of that is shared here amongst Canadians and how much is going to American corporations.
9164 2018-10-31 02:53:55 Hope the Oil Economy ends faster than predicted

9177 2018-10-31 02:50:48 Yes, Afghanistan was for profit.  Look up Afghanistan's opium market and how it skyrocketed after we invaded.  We're using them for drugs.  And probably oil too.

9179 2018-10-31 02:50:26 I wish I knew to care for my skin, especially my neck, before it was too late. I grew up living on the beach in the 70’s and 80’s when we soaked ourselves in baby oil.
9180 2018-10-31 02:50:11 That's not a shock but the ask on the other 4 isn't fair.

9187 2018-10-31 02:49:02 Neglected? No. There are many emulsions. From simple things like oil and vinegar, to ones with emulsifiers in them like, say, milk, espresso, or mayo

9198 2018-10-31 02:47:57 I can only say that I have had awesome results. Everyone's body reacts differently to CBD Oil than other's. The only way to know if it will have you is to try it for yourself. You may notice right away but it could take up to 2-3 weeks to fully get into your system.
9199 2018-10-31 02:47:50 So what did the US do? Like I’m seeing that there was a presence but let’s be honest, the US is always present when there’s oil to be had

9210 2018-10-31 02:46:21 Brent oil has recently reached a 4-year high. After living in Texas, I've realized the vast importance of oil industry, and the prices truly affect millions around the world #augedc
9211 2018-10-31 02:46:21 Breathing technique works for me. I also enjoy ASMR. Sometimes i sniff on my tea tree oil bcs somehow it calms me. Hope all is well with you, Arlina. Dont stop fighting.
9212 2018-10-31 02:46:14 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
9213 2018-10-31 02:46:10 You put too much oil in lol. Only need like a teaspoon

9217 2018-10-31 02:45:27 What is your prediction for oil prices? Let’s see how much you know. My money is on you don’t know much.
9218 2018-10-31 02:45:25 やります？
9219 2018-10-31 02:45:24 @baliga7 @shenoybv Btw, why Channels stopped giving Petrol prices in d metros ? Answer is simple they don’t want to highlight drop in oil prices; they don’t want to give credit to d Govt.
9220 2018-10-31 02:45:20 Bought a used car from Carvana. Pro: it is convenient. I was really busy had no time to go to dealer. Con: The maintenance people at Carvava was very careless. They overfilled the engine oil, over-inflated the front tire and under-inflated the back tire. One tire cap was missing.
9221 2018-10-31 02:45:09 It's going to be funny telling our mixed kids & grandkids about the oil dependent, unequal paying, divided and destructive ways we used to live by. But until then...
9222 2018-10-31 02:45:04 Also you should be careful about not working on an oil rig too long, crude oil is naturally radioactive, you guys should probably be wearing some kind of rads protection.
9223 2018-10-31 02:44:55 And if you are gonna use castor oil for your ends, just use like a tiny amount cause it's super thick and too much can be heavy... I usually use it before bed so my hair isn't as messy when I wake up...
9224 2018-10-31 02:44:52 Idk which one makes wonder but but skin acting up good this morning! since i got a lot of blocked pores i decided to skip moisturiser and changed to aloe vera gel. But i did double cleansing last night using cleansing oil, Alhamdulilah at least those tiny bumps reduce abit
9225 2018-10-31 02:44:50 i got really mf blessed that i don’t need to wash my face so i don’t break out. like i really only wash my face bc of dirt and oil and so my face stays extra soft ;)

9231 2018-10-31 02:44:16 ah ok!!! ill keep that in mind, ill probably get tea tree oil for now
9232 2018-10-31 02:44:10 I did an oil change in my Subaru tonight which is kinda of like a "software" update...
9233 2018-10-31 02:43:42 Not really because castor oil is like almost a gel consistency, so it will hold your ends... Olive oil is a more penetrative oil, so it's better for a hair mask... Argan oil is a sealing oil, so usually you can use it when your hair is 80% dry after a shower and it seals moisture

9249 2018-10-31 02:41:41 They appear to want to ban everything but offer no solutions. Hasn't Corbyn said he will stop arms sales to Saudi (which would be great) but we won't then have Saudi oil. We apparently hate Russia and have upset Trump so no fuel then. We'll be like Venezuela in no time.
9250 2018-10-31 02:41:39 ...the equally HUMONGOUS amount of energy consumed to transport oil from South America and the Middle East to the US, we might be able to have a real conversation. Sun/wind are converted to usable energy at exact, immediate grid entry points without refinement or transport.

Your idol, Mr. Trump, calls any news operation ‘fake’ that calls him out on his lies and abhorrent behavior. They’re simply reporting what he says and does. #FakeFoxNews is the fake outlet that’s hooked to your ‘caravan’ and drinking the snake oil.

9364 2018-10-31 02:24:05 @arunjaitley has clearly mishandled the economy in @narendramodi_in govt. All his tall talk of managing fiscal is due to non passing of low oil prices till now. And his blaming of RBI is also bogus. Just bcoz earlier RBI was lenient does not mean Urjit should not correct it now.
9365 2018-10-31 02:24:04 It's fair, because New Brunswick votes Liberal. Alberta votes conservative and extracts oil, so it must be punished.

9383 2018-10-31 02:21:24 Facial cleaning routine every night. I'm not playing with winter damnit. Exfoliated and then some sweet almond oil got my skin extra soft.
9384 2018-10-31 02:20:45 And to top it off I have no idea where  sweet oil is 
9385 2018-10-31 02:20:40 mmm Niugini Organics, where art thou. Been waiting for my oil for too many days. Cant even tag them.

9392 2018-10-31 02:19:00 The current suggestion of increase in administered price of oil ranging from 6 to 13 per liter will badly effect the economy in the form of inflation,poverty,unemployment.
Furthermore the tight monetary will partially ineffective.

Wtf is truffle essence. 

Either you can afford to eat truffles or you can’t, don’t put your crappy oil up in my business and try to make it sound expensive.
9404 2018-10-31 02:16:22 why did I ever stop using my oil diffuser? so relaxing
9405 2018-10-31 02:16:17 When you are going to get oil as line of credit on a flat rate how you are going to Increase prices  ?

9427 2018-10-31 02:13:05 To hold corporations accountable for the effects of their greed is NOT an intimidation campaign.  Journalists who broke the stories of oil companies' deception are NOT 'enemies of the people' and you are NOT honest, and you are NOT our friend.

9430 2018-10-31 02:12:44 It’s not bad selling palm oil for living and she can use her brand to move her business forward. With social media she can turn her fortunes around instead of portraying her sad story for compassion
9431 2018-10-31 02:12:26 someone please remind me to change my oil until i get it changed please just send me a text once a day until i finally do it
9432 2018-10-31 02:12:18 @arunjaitley I guess oil and motor tax out of GST is prudent. Vendetta politique chasing Mallya is all prudent. Farm loan waiver, white goods for votes, money for attending rallies money for social media, full pg media advt's, Heli rides to 400 rallies in 180 days ..all PRUDENT

For coolant its a chemical compound. For oil there's a different W rating for climate changes

9520 2018-10-31 01:59:29 Massage coconut oil into your scalp like 2x a week and sleep in it(wash it out really good tho)
9521 2018-10-31 01:59:19 Listen to the video, I had no idea she could be behind this movement of people from the Caribbean to a different culture with whom they share nothing in common. Of course Hillary is heavily invested in Haiti, especially if the oil reserve is significant.
9522 2018-10-31 01:58:56 @_mikaylaweiser remember that time you ate shit on coconut oil? That was the best. 
9523 2018-10-31 01:58:51 Hoes always be bout to blow they engine cause they don’t keep no oil in they car running to Dick.
9524 2018-10-31 01:58:27 Don't be fooled by big oil's "No on G" propaganda!

9526 2018-10-31 01:58:21 my room smells like oil, paint thinner, and rotting ambition

9528 2018-10-31 01:58:11 Well, we could drill on my farm if 112 passes. So there's that.
Problem is, no oil there.
9529 2018-10-31 01:58:06 Perhaps that'll happen when most of your lower bowl are there to entertain clients or whatever but it's a damn shame
9530 2018-10-31 01:57:37 Who's going to pay for the cleanup of all the toxic waste from the oil fields? I hope not the tax payers. It's time to make big corporations pay for the mess they have caused the environment not the tax payers.
9531 2018-10-31 01:57:35 I don’t understand “feud”. The guy thinks growth will solve climate change. Obviously, oil company growth is bad, and growth of “alternatives” is good. One “strategy” that gets overlooked is the non-incremental strategy of electing someone to tear up an oil company business lic.
9532 2018-10-31 01:57:34 We are met with defiant optimism basically every day but you would never know it based on the fan reaction in the bldg half of them don't even stand for goals anymore
9533 2018-10-31 01:57:12 If Saudi was not a strong American ally, trade sanctions would be rolling in by now. Without Saudi oil to America, China and the likes, Nigeria sells more oil, forces of demand and supply creep in and we rake in more money. Not something?
9534 2018-10-31 01:57:09 Minestrone without the pasta bits. I start w onions, carrots, celery, then add a big can of tomatoes (blended), stock, sweet potatoes, then once the potatoes are done I add kale, beans, and whatever else (frozen peas and corn, usually). Then a lot of minced garlic and olive oil!

Seems the Catholic Church are the only ones who care. Let us know of any other resources......Corporations might devote some profits toward this.

9541 2018-10-31 01:56:14 You must know that the gas in Venezuela cost more then that to produce that means oil workers aren't paid. 
Leases can't be paid. Wells can't stay open, refineries close, tanker drivers have no jobs.
Of course the government could pay, but only till money drys up and it did.
9542 2018-10-31 01:56:12 Do you have a big pot with a lid? If so a little bit of oil in it, pour kernals in and heat on stove with a lid. You're golden.

9545 2018-10-31 01:55:42 AB's oil industry has successfully brainwashed a lot of Albertans into thinking that it serves Alberta. It serves shareholders and executives. There's nothing wrong with that, but Albertans need to grasp the reality of it.

9566 2018-10-31 01:53:14 Yes on 112. Plenty of people don’t think Colorado needs Amazon’s HQ2. So, why do we need oil and gas?  There are plenty of other industries to fill the void.
9567 2018-10-31 01:53:01 they also produce a lot of oil
9568 2018-10-31 01:52:59 Not exactly sure why the early season audition was necessary...
9569 2018-10-31 01:52:59 Heard he's going to face a primary challenge from a real orangutan and a snake oil salesman.
9570 2018-10-31 01:52:57 agreed... its fucking terrible
9571 2018-10-31 01:52:42 Managed to make it to the dealer on time after work to get an oil change. Shoutout to @subaru_usa for their express service . Every visit is great.

9576 2018-10-31 01:51:51 a lot of the natural deterrents (cinnamon, peppermint oil, etc) aren't so much deterrents as much as they are things that cover/erase their smell trails. so they only work for however long it takes another single ant to find more water/resources and tell the other ants again

9580 2018-10-31 01:51:34 as I tried to point out last night, if we did this to many industries there would be complete outrage. No one would even drive a car if they knew all the deaths n pollution involved(way more btw than the oil industry on both measures)but because almost every has a car, no outrage
9581 2018-10-31 01:51:34 if im not mistaken i was told that coconut oil is a sealant and its very heavy so when u put it on it basically locks everything underneath it it doesnt moisturize like people think
9582 2018-10-31 01:51:34 Hey @GuyFieri and @FoodNetwork ,why do they even make Truffle oil? NEVER on GGG or Chopped, have heard someone say: u added just the right amount of truffle oilWhen do u EVER use this? Never tasted it. Or truffle's! To $$$$, plus I listen to you all! Just saying, Thanks

also do the 3+3 rule: 3 meals + 3 snacks a day.

November 4 is 5 days away but the $100 oil pundits have all disappeared from #CNBC. Does this mean #Iranian-phobia is gone? I wouldn't bet on this assumption. $100 oil pundits never die. They just fade away. Once oil prices rebound, they will show up quickly.

9623 2018-10-31 01:45:18 First off we dodnt have the strongest economy in the g7 according to kpmg and the imf so not sure where that comes from
Second yes we have lost many jobs due to carbon tax. Four major pipline companies are now building south of the border because of it why are oil trades 50 cent

9625 2018-10-31 01:45:08 The spike in oil prices was very much fear driven in the market it seems. Seems saudi arabia and irans posturing about the embargo could only sustain a very short term spike in prices. Too many viable alternatives in shale and EV to up supply and cut demand these days

9629 2018-10-31 01:44:40 But it's got to get upgraded somewhere along the way, doesn't it?
I'd have a way easier time getting on side with these companies screaming like babies about how they "must get their oil to market!" for the sake of the Canadian economy, if they showed they wanted to contribute.

9637 2018-10-31 01:43:37 Hmm, now I'm considering what to give out tommorow. Should it be brussel sprouts, toothbrushes, or cod liver oil?
9638 2018-10-31 01:43:32 “Global thermonuclear war will reduce restrictions and increase demand in the oil and gas industry. While infrastructure will be weakened, we expect oil to rule the newly opened market until technological developments in pig-based natural gas production in Bartertown.”
9639 2018-10-31 01:43:22 I think the CFL doesn’t want a stadium smaller than 24,000 seats .  My point is that Calgary can’t sell corporate boxes any longer as now that oil boom is done money has dried up so I how much corporate support can you see here ?

9646 2018-10-31 01:42:27 Leaking oil is a good sign, it means it still has oil in it.
9647 2018-10-31 01:42:14 Has Texans lost their minds!  Why would you consider voting for a socialist? Yes, Texas the next Venezuela with this man making decisions.  Take a look at your oil and gas industry- what insanity!  Better reconsider before you are looking at 1000% inflation as is Venezuela.

9661 2018-10-31 01:40:23 Ok, I’ll say it. Snake oil salesmen.
9662 2018-10-31 01:40:22 They created the Iraq war for oil, and there was probably some sort of payback element for the first time. And really - all of the ones I named talked at length about why Kavanaugh was horrible.

9664 2018-10-31 01:40:09 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
9665 2018-10-31 01:40:00 When will the EU learn. Don't be tempted by the oil $s. The Islamic Republic is the number one supporter of terrorism. It is incapable of being reformed.
9666 2018-10-31 01:39:58  Right now I’m using black seed oil. It’s working a little bit but I’m getting impatient.
9667 2018-10-31 01:39:54 Obama attacked oil & energy industries and laid off thousands and thousands of workers from their full time jobs, sending them to food stamps...
Trump’s tax cuts made all corporations offer me a lot more money for my work..
With obama the pay was going down, and down, and down
9668 2018-10-31 01:39:52 #Alittlebitofeverything... 1. Daikin “Quaternity” ductless as a dehumidifier, heating and cooling system for the basement 2. Two Burnham Oil fired hot water boilers w/ 80 gallon indirect water heater 3. Five Amana split hydro-air systems

9673 2018-10-31 01:39:01 I used to think women loved coconut oil because it was good for their skin. Now I know they mainly use it for anal lube. Oh what a time
9674 2018-10-31 01:38:46 @rachel_stringey “I am an essential oil diffuser at all times”
9675 2018-10-31 01:38:21 "Castor Oil possesses humectant properties, which means that it can draw moisture from the air into the skin, keeping your face hydrated and yielding a bright, glowing appearance."
luhh me some castor oil
9676 2018-10-31 01:38:07 See how mean he is now going to stop babies born here not to b citizens. How crazy is this he is so mean sand evil the devil has really got him. Get the oil
9677 2018-10-31 01:38:05 If olive oil is made from olives, what the heck is baby oil made from?

9678 2018-10-31 01:38:02 As my in-laws.. a year later my GP told me: something has changed, you’re heading for a stroke.. your LDL is way too high.. I refused to be hospitalised and went home somehow worried.. It started off with @mercola who suggested I do Cold Press Coconut oil
9679 2018-10-31 01:37:48 He already sold it to the company store, ie Russia, oil and southern bigots..& Trumped up.

9681 2018-10-31 01:37:23 When you sell your home you need to disclose if you have lead paint in your home if it was built prior to 1978. These two apparently chewed on their lead paint baseboards while growing up...
9682 2018-10-31 01:37:10 I don’t understand why any American would buy nudes, dude go to any east side of your city and buy a hooker. Problem solved! You’re welcome!!
9683 2018-10-31 01:37:07 Osige kalandian na lang hahahahaha
9684 2018-10-31 01:36:56 Why is it the stupid penalties always get scored on! No reason for the slash and we gave up all the momentum! Get it back oil!
9685 2018-10-31 01:36:45 Thinks of buying an essential oil diffuser for my workstation. Someone stop me pls
9686 2018-10-31 01:36:39 He probably got an oil change too but that didn't get announced
9687 2018-10-31 01:36:30 I stopped with "Obama got the government into mortgages and cars". Shoulda asked him about Hawaii and sugar. Or the oil industry. Or why the Constitution may not have much to say on student loans. Luckily for us, 'the right' governs with rational thinking...
FFS.
9688 2018-10-31 01:35:26 Awesome pack @WaveTraderAU - already using avocado oil - Why is this not in Australia ? Or is it ?
9689 2018-10-31 01:35:25 Canola oil, grape seed oil, oats, bread and wrong snacks.. Luckily my T2D did not require Medication as my GP told me: you’re more or less on the boarder and you’re slim enough to turn this around. Referred to Dietician who put me on similar rubbish ...
9690 2018-10-31 01:35:18 I love seeing people complain about working 9-5 and having weekends off, I just laugh and realize they’d never make it in the oil field

9692 2018-10-31 01:34:42 They probably called it something Orwellian like the "America is Great Oil and Gas Transparency Freedom Act"

9695 2018-10-31 01:34:28 Stop smearing Aluminum Zirconium on your arm pits. The pores in the arm pits are the largest on the body. Equal mix of baking soda, corn starch, and virgin coconut oil, makes a wonderful antiperspirant that lasts 3x longer.
9696 2018-10-31 01:34:22 :(
9697 2018-10-31 01:34:19 I don’t want it like Huntington Beach all the down the coastline, with onshore and offshore drilling operations destroying our beach experience and oil spills. This is an abomination and a last ditched plot by the doomed fossil fuel industrialists.
9698 2018-10-31 01:34:03 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.
9699 2018-10-31 01:33:37 He may have. Shapiro’s speaking to the choir, which sounds good if you’re in the choir. But black votes are the shale oil of the USA, and Kanye freakin’ West may have got quite a few to question their auto-follow of the Democrat Party. Who knows?
9700 2018-10-31 01:33:32 wait might this work on the mystery oil stain a sub letter left on my mattress? have tried so many rounds of Shout and scrubbing 
9701 2018-10-31 01:33:21 I hadnt thought about Sunny D in decades, I didnt know it still existed and I saw one recently in a convenience store fridge and I checked and it still contains oil  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
9702 2018-10-31 01:33:20 Naalala ko yung The lost case na pinanuod namin sa Sine Sindak. Ang ganda ni Oil 
9703 2018-10-31 01:33:17 Because he's a HUGE $$$ maker for Trump & his cronies - selling off public lands & licensing the mineral & rare earth rights. Changing restrictions on previously restricted lands to exploit & sell. He worked hand in hand w/Pruitt. 

Mineral/oil/rare earth/mining rights = BIG $$$
9704 2018-10-31 01:32:50 Iran, not oil.
9705 2018-10-31 01:32:45 I swear I’m sooooooo grateful for my dad. I honestly don’t know what I’d do without him.. I mean who can change my oil, tire, tell me when some wrong with the car & all that other mainly shit  deadass be lost

9712 2018-10-31 01:31:59 Busy scrubbing the oil from my garage floor.
9713 2018-10-31 01:31:58 honestly...I just fucking snapped on this dinner ! crispy tofu (brushed w olive oil and balsamic then breaded w just flour + salt n pepper) topped with cranberry goat cheese, and asparagus sautéed w butter, lemon, and garlic 
9714 2018-10-31 01:31:54 Why is having to get your oil changed the worst thing in the world
9715 2018-10-31 01:31:52 Girl I hope you put coconut oil in your hair before the bleach. It saves your hair from so much damage and you can leave it in while you bleach without it affecting it
9716 2018-10-31 01:31:45 I think my essential oil diffuser has cured my depression
9717 2018-10-31 01:31:41 Big Oil is trying to influence Prop 1!!!
Big Oil also gave me my PFD...

9718 2018-10-31 01:30:54 Not. 401ks have tanked. Costs for goods higher, oil higher! Now you want to cut Social Security and healthcare? Vote Blue. Vote em out!

9720 2018-10-31 01:30:34 No plan is what the Liberals have,do u not see that? Exempting major emitters & importing the very product you condemn in Canada is not remotely a plan. How is buying Saudi Oil shipping it half way around the world better for Canadians.

9731 2018-10-31 01:28:19 Yes, Hong Tang is her name and she is from Maryland and lives also in Bejing.  She brought us Zhenhua Oil which is the 4th largest refinery in China , Sinopec which is the largest and some others we will be working with.

I never created any vids. Sorry.
9742 2018-10-31 01:27:33 Trump's levying sanctions on Iran so we can't continue 2 buy cheap oil from them but have 2 pay 4 higher priced oil from the Saudi's as Kusher sealed the deal. It's the ONLY reason Trump turned on Iran deal. Nuclear weapons issue is deflection from oil. Most likely a Putin scheme

9745 2018-10-31 01:27:12 Lakoff should understand that Trump is a snake oil salesman who uses hyperbole (Lies) to get an emotional response, and then with repetition he enters someone "Frame" and thus become one of his followers.

The gunplay is terrible. The missions r the same one we played 100 times. There's even a snake oil salesman like the first 1
9759 2018-10-31 01:26:07 I mean, that's what they always say right? Ford wants to change your oil and replace your tires too.
9760 2018-10-31 01:26:05 I noticed that too. She must be burning the midnight oil big time. How can she even focus? I’m so tired I can barely put 140 characters together.

9762 2018-10-31 01:25:48 Not the way we do it. If you have a whole pot of grease and you pour it in a container it's gonna stay liquid like oil. I think it just gets hard when it's a little bit of it left out in the air or fridge.
9763 2018-10-31 01:25:45 Thank god. I managed to scrub the wound temp tattoos off of N’s face with micellar water . I didn’t have any baby oil and didn’t even think about having to remove them.

Maybe people who told you Trump would be impeached sold you snake oil and you should stop listening to them.
And why would you want Trump to be impeached? Do you think Mike Pence would be better as president? You're trading an incompetent maniac for a competent one.

9782 2018-10-31 01:21:19 The fundamental dynamics that led to AB and SK recession are the same (i.e. crashing oil&gas sector). Two provinces chose two different approaches to deal with the #recession, and now 2018 economic indicators can tell us which approach worked better. Clearly AB is doing better.

9785 2018-10-31 01:21:12 Every action has a reaction. Trump's hate started with Muslims. Than went to Native Americans trying to stop oil pumps. Than it was illegal LATINOS w/ no mention of illegal Whites. Finally went subliminal against Jews declaring Nationalism. Monsters have been created. On purpose?

9791 2018-10-31 01:20:28 The national monument of bears ears & the grand staircase was opened up for oil/gas drilling. No one mentions that Energy Fuels, an american subsidiary of a Canadian company is interested in the rich uranium fields. They lobbied to have this opened up.

9796 2018-10-31 01:19:34 It's already pretty regulated. What do you mean by more strictly controlled?

I'm fine with traditional ads for FDA approved medications, TV shows designed as infomercials for snake oil are much more concerning to me. #hcldr
9797 2018-10-31 01:19:32 had a combined age that was younger than those at Lehman and Micro Soft and yet on the dais Buddy claimed that they were born in the same year and hence god made the three black oil engineering applicants wealthy like Ellen G. and the others:  Lehman and Micro soft struggle.

9804 2018-10-31 01:18:51 Iran has the last top five crude oil reserve not (yet) under US/OPEC control. Iraq had one of those as well and just look at them now; Hillary Clinton called Iraq a "Business opportunity". So much business opportunity in Iran they've been on the hit list since 9/11 :/

9806 2018-10-31 01:18:28 Here's what one silicon valley recruiter said about the entrepreneurial movement:  Even if you fail, we look upon trying your own start-up favorably.  Shows you have drive. As one black student put it: I didn't care and yet three of the black Chevron oil engineering applicants
9807 2018-10-31 01:18:19 That is probably the biggest secret to good tofu, freeze and squeeze.  Marinate or giving it a quick dip in some soy sauce and olive oil before cooking it is real nice too

9809 2018-10-31 01:17:55 Wife: Are you gonna take my car to get an oil change this weekend?
Me: Heck no. You do it.
Wife: You're the husband. You do the oil changes. I grow the babies, you do the oil changes.

My wife is oppressing me with her traditionalism and gender tropes. Send help.
9810 2018-10-31 01:17:54 So say you deep fry some chicken. You keep the grease and the next to you fry some chicken or pork chops or something similar then you just use that grease again and not a new thing of vegetable oil
9811 2018-10-31 01:17:45 If Inslee is voting yes, you know this is a worthless initiative. It will lead to higher gas and oil for sure. And Washington state already has the second highest gas tax in the nation. #voteno1631 #MAGA
9812 2018-10-31 01:17:37 Stop asking stupid questions. It takes 12 pounds of flowers to treat one person for one year. It takes between 5 and 6 pounds of hashish to make one batch of Holy Anointing Oil. You guys are so stupid!
9813 2018-10-31 01:17:36 I need to get an oil change soon 
9814 2018-10-31 01:17:15 Decided it was time to do an oil change and brake check. So much damn easier when the car is same height as me
9815 2018-10-31 01:17:15 I detest this from the left, but: How many Canadian lives are lost each day due to $10 million dollars per day of royalties lost to this madness. And I speak as a Texan benefiting from the capital not spent on Alberta Oil Sands investment.

9826 2018-10-31 01:16:02 You do understand that if country lack technical expertise to exploit such resources, then its better to outsource it to other company, rather than nationalizing it with incompetent staff. Look what Venezuela oil industry had become, its a total mess.

So us WADIGO should ask God to stop the ocean from carrying the rain clouds to Muran'ga ama? Nge'ch!

9845 2018-10-31 01:14:47 Congrats on 1,000 games in the NHL for Jason Spezza. When he broke into the league, I was in the Sens PR department and I remember giving him a ride in my 1995 Dodge Neon - which was leaking oil at the time. 

Thankfully, he survived that trip and made it to this milestone.

9851 2018-10-31 01:14:05 Policymakers like its economic effects on poorer countries.Whereas oil n mining employ few people, tourism employs legions. And it can help the rest of the economy develop, since policies designed to attract tourists, such as easy visas and good policing,  lure foreign investors

9854 2018-10-31 01:13:27 This non conservative loves and support oil and gas!
9855 2018-10-31 01:13:24 That makes sense, given that we are mining for gold deeper into the centre of the earth. I also heard somewhere that the theory about oil coming from fossils may be false. Specifically, perhaps some bacteria constantly produces oil, and so actually, oil might be renewable.

9870 2018-10-31 01:10:51 The way so many posters online make it sound, it's as if Alberta has a singular nationalised oil industry that is owned and run by the province for the benefit of its citizens and Canadians in general.

It really makes you wonder what sort of trolls are pushing that narrative.

They’ve done amazingly well considering the absolute disaster the PCs left them. There’s a reason the economy grew 4.1% here, and Kenney would kill the recovery.
9890 2018-10-31 01:07:00 Gotta figure out how to do that. That's the strategy. There's oil on the lanes that affects how the ball rolls. You have to find a line them anticipate how it is going to break down and move accordingly.

It's not golf, but it's a fun challenge.

9912 2018-10-31 01:04:00 Yeah, that happens when the U.S. uses economic warfare, sanctions, and promotes violent regime change to steal other countries resources. Venezuela is guilty of sitting on the 4th largest oil reserves and wanting to nationalize for the good of their citizens, not U.S. corps.

I want to put a simple question.
What are you doing to effectively stop adulteration in food items? Milk and it's products, honey, mustard oil, ghee . For instance real honey has no expiry date but honey in market lasts for about 18 months or so.

9930 2018-10-31 01:01:35 OIL
9931 2018-10-31 01:01:14 I totally agree.  I generally recommend Animal Fats, Avocado oil, Grass-Fed Butter and Ghee, Coconut oil, Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Coconut Butter, MCT Oil, and Grass-fed cheese or cream.  Overly processed industrial oils (corn, etc.) should be avoided.
9932 2018-10-31 01:01:10 Not so. Heavy oil provides particular cuts like asphalt & polymers that you can't get from mid-weight of lightweight crudes. There's plenty of demand for the product. The issue is the transport costs.

increase your consumption of healthful fats like extra virgin olive oil, avocado, grass-fed beef, wild fish, coconut oil, nuts and seeds. keep in mind that modified fats like hydrogenated or trans fats are the worst choices for brain health.

9968 2018-10-31 00:57:12 I would say that Mx could be a good spot to develop infrastructure to move all stranded oil in Permian, but the demand (refineries) are just not there. 

With all the uncertainty and volatility due to the upcoming administration, the idea of developing new refineries is weak.

9994 2018-10-31 00:51:30 According to research, oils with high oleic acid content (e.g. olive oil) are detrimental to skin barrier function. It has been shown that oleic acid increases  skin's permeability & reduces  stratum corneum integrity, which may exacerbate irrritation and/or inflammation
