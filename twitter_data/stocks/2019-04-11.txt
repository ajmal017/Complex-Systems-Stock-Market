1 2019-04-11 23:56:50 You know it. A lot of bashing towards GGI on numerous forums. The shorts tend to show up when news is imminent and there is usually a sell on news. It’s a BMR pick and a lot of their stocks tend to be targeted for a sell on news.
2 2019-04-11 23:55:40 It is definitely not the same as stocks. Something you don’t want to just jump in to.

5 2019-04-11 23:52:57 Are options difficult or is there a big difference compared to stocks?
6 2019-04-11 23:52:18 re $UBER vs $LYFT as public stocks...

I'm not well-read on subject nor reading S-1s, but intuitively, by geographic scale + other biz lines, feels as if Uber should be worth 10x Lyft. Not a value judgment against Lyft. If true, I wonder which stock moves to make equation valid.

13 2019-04-11 23:46:54 Big difference in bump stocks and banning all assault weapons.

However, my top issue is someone who is pro-life & will put conservative judges in the courts, so I would not vote for a Democrat.
14 2019-04-11 23:45:56 Yes, Barr has a black heart too now. He has joined the rich man club of question deflectors. Trump is saying : "Wikileaks....I know nothing about Wikileaks....it's not my thing." These men are the laughing stocks of America.
15 2019-04-11 23:45:31 Bad earnings are good for stocks to go higher, right?
16 2019-04-11 23:44:44 Hamid's thesis seems not to be informed by the President separating families to boost private prison stocks, declaring a national emergency in order to circumvent Congress, or keeping an Acting Cabinet devoid of enough confirmed secretaries to consider a 25 Amend. solution.

18 2019-04-11 23:43:33 My top issue by far is non-interventionism, then ending the drug war and protecting whistle blowers. Her gun control stuff bothers me the most but Trump banned bump stocks so he's not exactly pristine on that issue either. There is no candidate I agree with 100%.
