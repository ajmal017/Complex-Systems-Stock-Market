132 2018-01-28 10:35:35 As are all fiat currencies. Besides who says it has to be a currencies. Islam permits trading of commodities and if everyone regards Bitcoin as such then it’s hard to argue otherwise.
133 2018-01-28 10:19:07 Selfies will not do any good to the poor massess , kindly bring down high prices of petrol and disel , all time high as of now . Control prises of essential commodities soaring so high into the sky
134 2018-01-28 10:14:12 War Quran 8:67- It is not for a prophet to have captives [of war] until he inflicts a massacre [upon Allah 's enemies] in the land. Some Muslims desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.

136 2018-01-28 09:29:55 @TimesNow @IndiaToday   Media people please do not use terminology which degrades the meaning of human beings..sold, bought, unsold, deals... Cricket is a sport played by humans and they are not trade-able commodities.. stooping to so low levels finishes the dignity of our race..

144 2018-01-28 08:33:25 I’m hoping jorc this week.
By the sound of AP it was very very close and also the way commodities have performed it should be a great quarterly report #VAST
145 2018-01-28 08:31:29 @vijaytelevision guys can you stop wasting daily commodities like eggs, icecream and squashes on people and try organising some programs or camps where these things can reach people below poverty line who still dream of having these things..!!?

147 2018-01-28 08:16:46 of course but there's more to it like say you have an extremely high income at which point you already have all you want and choose to allocate your income purchasing commodities that further increase your income like stocks rather than cars
148 2018-01-28 08:16:06 "Let there be a marketplace of ideas" fuck this very late stage of capitalism wherein even the truth and lies are being posed like commodities which we are free to pick according to our convenience
149 2018-01-28 08:14:50 Pure economics & there is an @ecowas_cedeao protocol, agreement to develop Railway links across West Africa. Niger is also a major trading partner of Nigeria in commodities. There are multiple arguments in favour of that project that I cannot tweet about here.
150 2018-01-28 08:08:42 Time to introspect as to how the  " net worth " deciding corporate bigwigs, that are actually matters of NO substance to the unimaginable discipline, toil, skills of a sportsperson, can affect the psyche of cricketers of Indian origin by treating them as "commodities" @IPL .
151 2018-01-28 08:06:53 Commodities being traded at stock market atleast get sold. Unsold players tag ... is such an insult to their talent.  #IPL2018Auction
152 2018-01-28 08:03:40 Thank you.  It was not so bad before when Twitter supported the poets.  I am afraid I do not understand what is happening,  we still form part of twitter and help to generate and maintain interest - we are like bread and butter commodities.
153 2018-01-28 08:02:51 The main message I wanted to send to my clients during the #Commodities #Outlook 2018 I held last week is that even if will stay supported, raw materials are vulnerable to mini flash crashes during the year
154 2018-01-28 07:34:20 @forestbonnieMFC I trade commodities, and it is very hit and miss. Sometimes you just have to strike out and hope for the best.

Never trade through dgcx.
158 2018-01-28 06:56:14 I guess people now confuse rights with commodities. You know, education is not what it used to be. Both institutional and parents just don't teach them right.
159 2018-01-28 06:38:22 Coffee is one of the most traded commodities. . .
160 2018-01-28 06:36:21 Ah, a socialist. Commodities produced by another should OF COURSE be distributed to everyone. 
161 2018-01-28 06:31:45 When the largest economies in the world are drunk on manipulated currencies and facing a paradigm shift, I like commodities and gold.  For too many reasons to fit the Twitter character limit.

163 2018-01-28 06:25:35 Unfortunately it is because so many people view animals as commodities that there are so many feral cats and why shelters are full of them. Humans are irresponsible.

164 2018-01-28 06:24:10 Nobody knows what will happen in cyclic and commodities 1&2 years from now. I only track them 2 quarters ahead.
165 2018-01-28 06:23:24 Also, not all major companies are as awful as Amazon (I've read about how bad their work conditions are). For example, Google is specifically made to be a comfortable place to work (I went there on a school trip, and they have commodities like free food, massages, and game rooms)

177 2018-01-28 04:47:55 Morrison insists it will return to balance in 2020-21. This is based on the heroic assumption that parliament will pass all his planned spending cuts and that China will continue to power our economy with its demand for our commodities,
178 2018-01-28 04:46:29 But there was an argument between Snoke/Hux?? Why are they keeping such precious commodities hidden from us?
179 2018-01-28 04:29:59 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
180 2018-01-28 04:22:48 You should look at the history of individuals trying to corner commodities/futures markets as well
181 2018-01-28 04:18:41 I'm only talking about energy producers at the moment. However, while it could extend to producers of other commodities, energy is the biggest commodity and, I suspect, of sufficient size to act as a game changer all by itself.

186 2018-01-28 03:45:47 The Fed reserve issued trillions of dollars to banksters, and all they did was bubble up commodities for a few years. Learn #MMT and that money *does* grow on trees (cannabis, apples, oranges) and the USA can expand our economy. Let's grow the pie with hard work!
187 2018-01-28 03:36:19 Commodities are the opium of the people.

190 2018-01-28 03:08:31 Be very prudent in exposure to bond proxy equities, such as utilities.  If you have done well in growth (etc FANGS), take some money out, don't let all of the profits ride.  Keep some "free" cash available to leverage any correction.  Long commodities, industrials.
191 2018-01-28 02:50:13 This a fact and so did Obama care it's killing the smaller family farmers i wish people would look at the commodities market and see that it's the retailers that are making a killing not the farmers

195 2018-01-28 02:40:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
196 2018-01-28 02:14:08 Moral degradation of human beings has reached a nadir... terms like 'hefty deals' 'bought' and sold are being used for cricket players...ladies display their 'pregnancies' and 'stretch marks' so often ...Are humans commodities ? Have we really developed in the last few decades ?
197 2018-01-28 02:09:33 Yes. That’s exactly right. The liberal government at the time allowed the bank to make mortgages a commodity that could be traded and asked loans to be given with lower credit ratings. When the couldn’t pay the commodities crashed in value and the banks went broke.
198 2018-01-28 01:51:22 Is it not how futures function? Lol just because $btc appreciated a lot in a short period of time why should expectations differ if people have bullish expectations. It’s all speculation after all  be it stocks or commodities

261 2018-01-27 19:07:01 The value of social platforms are their users' unexpected contribution. However, social platforms as commodities stem from their moderation, the fine tuning and ongoing collaboration of that unexpected contribution. #CSMIT2018 #socialmedia #civictech #design #ux #tech

263 2018-01-27 18:50:45 Seriously @AlexWitt why would #democrats accept a #DACADeal  without legal protection for their undocumented parents? Media refuses to state the repugnant truth, @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr are openly trading in human flesh. #Dreamers are people not commodities.
264 2018-01-27 18:38:32 And just as good farming exists so does bad farming. I see many example of poor welfare as animals are merely commodities. When you pay for animal products you support both sides, and knowing that good farming exists doesn't remove your responsibilty for supporting the bad too.

269 2018-01-27 17:55:02 I can only trade the current market. Weak $ likely a +ve for commodities. I think you can get more juice out of a Long commodity trade vs short $ so that’s how I would position. I am long $XOP for full disclosure.

273 2018-01-27 17:23:29 I personally do better w/ less total posns but more highly concentrated in theme. Ex: heavily involved in the latest run in commodities w/ a little tech still onboard. That vs a little of everything

301 2018-01-27 14:33:07 I find, with commodities, and forex, horizontal lines, on the long view, are more telling than trend lines.  As such, the 85 handle is in play, assuming the $DXY weakness is structural, IMO.

310 2018-01-27 13:31:44 Weak dollar artificially props up stocks and hard assets like commodities. Since these assets are largely owned by the rich,  incentive to keep this trend intact until they have rung the register.

324 2018-01-27 11:41:22 With respect, it wasn’t created to be a trading bloc. It originated out of a need to ensure security over/stable prices for necessary commodities (European Coal & Steel) and agriculture (CAP), so that no European country wd go to war to secure these again. EU evolved from this.

460 2018-01-26 20:56:30 Gold & Silver are not commodities, they're real money. Good luck exchanging Wheat or a Cow to buy groceries or a suit. History shows they move similarly but not to the same extent, nor have they been as suppressed as precious metals for decades.
461 2018-01-26 20:54:42 Given what is going on with commodities, stocks, and the dollar, the Fed with it's interest rates where they are appears woefully behind the curve - at least that is what the market's are saying

468 2018-01-26 20:08:45 The most profitable trades come from buying or selling when no one else is.   Better long opportunities come from alerts to avoid a security than from alerts that a breakout already happened. (Its in the past so opportunity is gone!)

655 2018-01-26 06:59:16 I might go into online stocks and commodities trading this year (once I study it and understand how it works). Eagle Global Markets' app that allows you trade using Naira on their app is so dope.
656 2018-01-26 06:57:16 Our youths have no jobs and price of basic commodities is skyrocketing. The common mwananchi is suffering yet we pretend that all is well. We must get back to the basics and set out the mess brought about by our new constitution.

660 2018-01-26 06:38:34 Your line of argument is faulty, prices of all commodities (food inclusive) sowed high because of plethora of issues. How do you explain increase in price of other commodities?

662 2018-01-26 06:23:36 Not really creepy. Fact is SEC handles securities, not commodities. One option would be for Congress to just add “blockchain-based digital commodities” to the SEC mandate. The alternative is for them to define most alt-coins as securities.

666 2018-01-26 05:53:38 Do you know that in Luanda, my rural home, the one shilling coin lost value as far back as 2015? Commodities are priced in denominations of 5/=. Shopkeepers rarely accept 1/= coins. If you are buying sweets @ 1/= each the minimum purchase is 5 pieces.
667 2018-01-26 05:46:11 Exactly! Why has the FG hesitantly refused to go by the Ranching system been proposed by other state govts. If you are give colonies for cattle farming, will you do same for other farm commodities or businesses?

677 2018-01-26 04:32:05 Ottawa Children's Aid Society is too lazy to do their jobs properly so they do that scoop as soon as they see an Indigenous infant. Infants are hot commodities for childless couples who can't conceive.
678 2018-01-26 04:26:12 When I was young, we used to return containers for common commodities for reuse (milk, cream, beer, motor oil etc) and other general goods (bleach, bluing, ammonia, cooking oil etc) came in glass jugs or metal cans. A little more work but less pollution.

682 2018-01-26 03:45:55 Good Men may seem like commodities yes, but they are not that hard to find. We’ve been conditioned to date narcissists and to take care of folks who can’t even reciprocate our actions.
683 2018-01-26 03:45:37 Yes, so it's very skewed perception using $DXY alone. I don't know "which is the best measurement of the dollar" & can't give advice on here really.
