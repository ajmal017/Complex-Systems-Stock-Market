1 2019-04-04 23:58:39 Donald Trump is a bald-faced liar and apparently his followers are, too.  Nowhere in this article does its author "predict a stock market crash in 2018."

"One thing we are closely monitoring, and we do not have a final answer yet, is WHETHER U.S. stocks will crash in 2018."

19 2019-04-04 23:44:31 I know, it's super insulting when they are combo-ing you to death whilst 2 stocks ahead and they're like "man, I'm playing bad today" and when they lose it's like "I was playing a character I've never played" guess what, so am I. I hate those people, it annoys me to no end.
