40 2018-09-26 23:56:43 I disagree with your statement. With the billions in subsidies paid to big oil, not including $10B for TMX, we have options.
41 2018-09-26 23:56:27 If you want McDonald's fries without the chemicals, just fry potato slices in peanut oil, nothing more, nothing less, it'll give you the guilty feeling of McDonald's, but without the guilt

49 2018-09-26 23:55:21 Does he pay someone to follow him around with a mop & a bucket of oil dry so he won't be sued by somebody slipping & breaking their neck on the trail he leaves behind him..

55 2018-09-26 23:54:26 That's what people like Elon Musk think as well. No thanks, slaving away in a mine or working on an oil rig isn't my idea of living a fulfilled life. I'm guessing you want to cure death as well.
56 2018-09-26 23:54:18 You're speaking to an arborist. You know what I use for bar oil? Recycled vegetable oil from my deep fat fryer at home. 
57 2018-09-26 23:54:17 Took my truck to get an oil change

$500 later I have a “much less chance of loosing the tire I bought 1000 miles ago”

79 2018-09-26 23:51:36 ExonnMobil is funding Guyana's border dispute claim with Venezuela so that they can destroy the environment, access the oil, profit, and exploit the locals. 

So much to unpack about capitalism, land and borders, the environment..
80 2018-09-26 23:51:35 You'd hope so. He claims to be a single father, a widowed man who also has a really lucrative career in the oil rigging business. However, he's definitely asked people for money online.... so I think he's bad news...

105 2018-09-26 23:49:09 RT SwarnaBharatIN "While the Modi government may have limited control over the global price of oil, it is solely responsible for the fall in the value of the rupee and the heavy taxation of petrol.

108 2018-09-26 23:48:52 But I trade oil and gas mainly so no expect thats for sure ..
109 2018-09-26 23:48:46 Yes there are many. For starters: stop tax write-offs for oil exploration, the building of pipelines and other infrastructure, close loopholes that allow oil companies huge profits without paying taxes, make them pay full price for clean-up of spills and contamination.
110 2018-09-26 23:48:31 i have one called ‘in the 5th degree’ by prohibited and i love it ! has a herbal and oil cartridge PLUS you can buy add-ons from the site to make it a dab straw or e-rig (i don’t have these but still cool) kinda of expensive but i think it works wonderfully check it out

251 2018-09-26 23:34:06 Putin and Russia are going broke. Russian oil sales are down. The reason Trump attacked OPEC. The only thing they are selling is military weapons to Syria and certain other middle eastern countries.
252 2018-09-26 23:33:53 Let’s not forget. Saudi Arabia’s main export is not Oil. It’s terrorism
253 2018-09-26 23:33:53 Yes it does! Oil based sauce, spices, & adobo is the beeest!
254 2018-09-26 23:33:52 Work for an oil company?
255 2018-09-26 23:33:50 Stop callin y’all self broke college students. I don’t call myself a broke oil change nigga

258 2018-09-26 23:33:33 I feel bad for the people of Venezuela who believe that Trump wants to help because of his heart.  

It's all about the oil, nothing more nothing less, and he really couldn't care less about the people, from an area, that he used to call "rapists and murderers".

260 2018-09-26 23:33:24 Of course not.  That's how Democrats are.  Everything is ok for them to do to you. But it is not even acceptable for you to defend yourself against them.
261 2018-09-26 23:33:23 With Canada's higher taxes, wages, electricity prices & now tariffs, yes they will. It will happen over a period of time but once they are gone they won't be coming back. In the short term it just means no new investment no new jobs. Just like Trudeau did to Albertas oil industry
262 2018-09-26 23:33:22 Actually, not the expenses all the time, asphaltic concrete are not cheap too,depend on your bituminous mix,and concrete depends on the thickness of your slab,which is a fx of d design load,and load transmission.
The nature of soil and bearing capacity ,CBR is also considered

264 2018-09-26 23:33:18 Canada supplies 30% of US oil for 60% less than OPEC. Maybe we should join OPEC as well 
265 2018-09-26 23:33:06 @HondaCustSvc @Honda @HondaInAmerica What oil options does my 2018 Accord Sport 1.5T have? Local dealer had Ultimate Full and Full Synthetic listed on this printed chart of Honda motor oils and transmission fluids. Is there any difference? Thanks in advance.

271 2018-09-26 23:32:31 I wonder if JBP (pseudo-intellectual snake oil salesman & dullard) is aware of Dave Sim (total maniac, hypermonotheist, woman-hater extreme, & comic book auteur turned hermetic shut-in)? JBP’s parenthetical asides remind me of Sim’s quite a bit. And theyre both Canadian lunatics.
272 2018-09-26 23:32:23 What our children eat is FAR worse than the oil plants in Fort McMurray, in fact this isnt worth discussing I'm out!

274 2018-09-26 23:32:11 #AuthorConfession D26. I think Razor would be the only one to do a podcast. He'd prolly call it Razor's Edge and it would be a lot of guy related stuff. Motorcycles, how to clean your gun, what brands of tequila to buy, beard oil is for whimps... that kind of stuff
275 2018-09-26 23:32:10 On toast w olive oil, pumpkin seeds and sea salt. Yay!
276 2018-09-26 23:32:07 Oooh, this would be fabulous as the something #DeliciouslyDifferent I want to try was added to my Amazon wish list this evening (truffle oil!) x

278 2018-09-26 23:31:45 Now Win - it’s not fair to use words like cognitive dissonance when talking to the Congressman.  Remember use intellectually appropriate words ie - 7 Eleven, Spinx and “it’s ok to drill for oil off the SC Coast because it’s over the horizon and no one will know you’re doing it”!
279 2018-09-26 23:31:42 just looking at this beautiful photo I can hear the isley brothers and oil sizzlin in a frying pan

285 2018-09-26 23:30:47 The US now exports oil, so they no longer need Canadian Oil. For Canada to sell they have to lower the price. Then the US turns around and sells oil products to Ontario and Quebec for world price. HAHAHAHAHA

289 2018-09-26 23:30:27 The only thing you mentioned here, that Trump cares about, is the drug cartels, and you said it yourself. They control the oil. 

In case you didn't know, America has wanted your oil for decades. Nows a pretty ripe opportunity to finally get it

294 2018-09-26 23:29:57 Trump controls the SPR, not you. Now, thanks to your careless words, oil will rise & gas will hit $3 before midterms. You should be sacked.

305 2018-09-26 23:29:05 "Scotland's oil" they claim.  Fracking, not actually banned and licences renewed. Virtue signalling.  It isn't lazy to suggest so, it happens to be well considered given the facts.  But you just blindly believe all the rhetoric.

310 2018-09-26 23:28:26 Possibly something lost in translation?
Bass pros use additives if they're stuck using ethanol. 
Us Okies were raised on leaded premium gas.

We want real gas in our small engines...heritage?

315 2018-09-26 23:27:44 Tarsands is privatized and foreign-owned. The revenue goes to the foreign-owned oil companies, not to Canadians or Canada.

If oil prices rise, the foreign-owned oil companies get the windfall, not Canadian workers or Canada as a whole.   #cdnpoli #tarsands

323 2018-09-26 23:27:22 All that coverage and oil control (unlike anything else I’ve ever tried) yet feels so lightweight. No powdery finish. No oily shine. It’s kinda magical. I’ll post photos tomorrow.

326 2018-09-26 23:27:07 Time to turn off the oil. They import 4 times as much oil from Canada as they do from Saudi Arabia. I would think reducing their oil supply would put a squeeze on them where it hurts. Negotiating with a selfish bully is almost pointless. He is not a negotiator. He is a dictator

Choosing instead to attack a life long anti racist & peace campaigner for appearing on foreign telly.

351 2018-09-26 23:24:00 They are not a capitalist country. They own the oil production...oh wait...they can't afford to produce oil. I know people here in Tampa who WERE farmers in Venezuela. Why did they move here? Because the government took their property!
352 2018-09-26 23:23:55 Honestly though take a shot every time I go to change my oil and the workers flirt with me and give me a discount. I don’t even have to do anything I just go home after I am so blessed

384 2018-09-26 23:20:00 Nigeria does not have crude oil what Nigeria has is groundnut oil . We claim to discover oil before independence but look at Dubai of yesterday is like paradise
385 2018-09-26 23:19:52 Nope faulty pipelines aren't the answer. Technically rail would be the safest way to transport but out railway has been neglected & staff not trained properly.

There is 0 need for another pipeline. A refinery would allow us to clean our dirty oil & sell it at full price

502 2018-09-26 23:08:38 Thank you!!! I’m blue in the face telling people mindfulness is bs. Don’t think they believe me as I’m not a psychiatrist or a psychologist. The cult of wellbeing doesn’t help either. People being sold snake oil for mental health.
503 2018-09-26 23:08:38 I say @cafreeland is doing a great job and Canadians should be proud of her standing up to that bully! When he taxes the cars start selling our oil to Germany!

Mentioned it to my wife, she said what she doesn't like is too much mayo. I went because my oldest loves your food. Just thought you might like to know.

517 2018-09-26 23:07:35 Iran had a democratically elected prez overthrown by oil interests. Then,  ca. 25 years of a brutal regime. Only ones left to oppose it were the fundies. That happened all over the ME. Thank the US for that. That doesn’t mean I’m a fan of Russia or Iran.
518 2018-09-26 23:07:34 Yo. So how about I’m at church Sunday and I walk in and the singers are talking about how they’re gonna start drinking tea and someone mentions eucalyptus oil. Is it really that great? From a vocalist’s perspective.

544 2018-09-26 23:04:02 EXERCISE a lot!! (I do boxing), Olly brand stress relief vitamins, and CBD oil (just started trying it and it’s pretty relaxing). I have debilitating anxiety, so I haven’t found an end all be all cure, but these give a little bit of relief

546 2018-09-26 23:03:52 The money saving thought never occurred to them to simply drop old clapped-out Murican made pickups on top of those Toyotas? I suppose they consider the pollution from old crankcase oil to be far worse than spent uranium shells.

548 2018-09-26 23:03:41 Good! Not only does Canada sell you it’s oil at cheap prices, they also PAY you to refine it (US jobs) and buy it back at a higher price! Hopefully Canadians will wisen up and be more self sufficient.

568 2018-09-26 23:01:46 The reason we sell our oil below market value is because it isnt WTI oil, its Western Canadian Select which is a lower grade of oil. Currently the US is our only customer because of our own inability to get a pipeline to tidewater. Due in large part to US ENGOs. #TMX
569 2018-09-26 23:01:40 The @lp_hehir column in @TheSpinoffTV on the offshore oil and gas ban argues NZ lacks "the cultural power and economic clout to make a material impact on what happens overseas".

It starts with a US/UK organised coup. regime change, in 1953, which was indeed all about oil.
The revolt in 1979  *was not principally Islamic* but revolution was taken over by the better-organised Islamic faction

684 2018-09-26 22:51:52 Food prices rose because inflation was running at double figures in the 1970s (peaking at 25%). The caused were rapidly rising oil prices and the inflationary cycle being perpetuated by pay rises demanded by powerful unions. Absolutely nothing to do with EEC.

It's ultimately a chess game over the oil.

761 2018-09-26 22:44:54 Canola oil was originally called rapeseed oil, but rechristened by the Canadian oil industry in 1978 to avoid negative connotations. "Canola" is short for "Canadian oil." #HIST125005F18

787 2018-09-26 22:42:39 It's the future, but it's a very distant future. Sadly EVs depend on oil for fabrics, plastics, tyres  paints and lubricants. Until we resolve that, somewhat wasting our time.
788 2018-09-26 22:42:32 Murkowski is not pro choice, and she owes republicans for opening up ANWR to oil exploration, which is a big deal for Alaskans who want oil money payments.  Makes her re-election almost a done deal. Unless Alaskans care more about reproductive rights.

794 2018-09-26 22:41:52 Sorry to hear about injury. Just a suggestion based on known research - 1,000 mg+ of Vit. C. (Emergen-C powder in water is helpful) daily,horsetail capsules and magnesium oil rubbed on the injury daily and Epsom salt soaks as well.
795 2018-09-26 22:41:50 Cotton pad

874 2018-09-26 22:34:10 You do love the cheap Canadian oil I guess that will be gone once nafta because Canada won’t have to give th United States the 75 per cent that they currently have to now China would love that
875 2018-09-26 22:33:57 Unfortunately profit comes before everything and everyones welfare under this current regime. If only we were as focused on renewable as we are on oil and gas. We need to take the profit out of fossil fuels

889 2018-09-26 22:33:03 You talk about a free market in $s, but the world has been unable to buy oil with anything else. Once oil is widely priced in other currencies, many dollars - and the inflation that's been exported - may indeed return in search of US goods and services. Could be interesting.

895 2018-09-26 22:32:24 I don’t think many people realize that Canada must sell almost all of its oil to the US below market value under NAFTA. All those Trump supporters are going to be pissed when it’s costs more to buy a truck because of tariffs and double to put gas in because no NAFTA.

927 2018-09-26 22:29:25 Canada kicked off negotiations with gender, aboriginal, environmental, and labor issues. That likely did not bode well. Canada US trade is roughly balanced, largely because of auto and oil. Still Canada needs a deal much more than US.

948 2018-09-26 22:27:10 I'd agree with this, have to remember that we can technically land Grain to the east coast from overseas at $100/t less than current domestic prices (ignoring biosecurity restrictions). So should not be surprised that an exported oil Crop is not seeing same lift in price

962 2018-09-26 22:25:44 US will NOT stop "disruptive interference" in Middle East. As for "cheaper oil" the US will DESTROY Syria's Assad and COMMANDEER their oil-reserves. Same with Venezuela!! US WILL KILL and STEAL what they want. 'Tis always been thus.

968 2018-09-26 22:25:30 Whew Chile. Car maintenance is expensive. Just change the oil and call it a day mane
969 2018-09-26 22:25:25 It's not like u will add the same quantity u use to make stew na. It's just a very little quantity, barely enough to alter the taste. The purpose is for the baby to benefit from the nutritive value of the palm oil and salt. No be say u go cook soup on top the matter
970 2018-09-26 22:25:23 Go and sell palm oil oooo. 
971 2018-09-26 22:25:22 tbh theres aa good argument to be made that these werent pursued because lack of dependence on oil would lead to less excuse for geopolitical presence in the middle east during cold war, as well as inability to make nukes

1015 2018-09-26 22:21:51 What oil is it ?
1016 2018-09-26 22:21:33 Absolutely unnecessary - it is time to get off oil and leave as much in the ground as possible. Especially the extraordinary dirty tar sands oil.

1022 2018-09-26 22:20:30 Nope, you're racist. And the pipeline isn't needed. KXL is a more direct way to get our oil to the Gulf coast than to load a tanker in BC and sail it to the Gulf via the Panama canal.

1057 2018-09-26 22:18:25 That wouldn't suprrise me. But it also wouldn't surprise me if that contention was stoked by Putin. Canada and Putin are at odds over who gets to drill where in the Arctic for oil.

1124 2018-09-26 22:12:54 No. Not at all. I think this is something that only Venezuelans or the UN should fix. If they let Trump go in, he’ll conference with Putin to find a puppet right wing guy even worst than Maduro. Trump will take the oil from them. Not a good solution for the people of Venezuela.

1217 2018-09-26 22:06:02 The only reason Saudi Arabia’s allowed to brazenly commit such horrendous crimes of humanity to innocent civilians in Yemen is due to its mutual dependence with the West.

1232 2018-09-26 22:05:10 @AllmericanMayes hey kerosene isnt volatile enough to do anything being poured on a fire. Would just put it out. Like pouring oil on a fire.

1234 2018-09-26 22:05:07 oh ok, that sounds nice! And one more question.  What is the approximate ratio of lavender oil to arnica gel?  Just add a dab to the gel, or like a teaspoon or table spoon, etc.?

1255 2018-09-26 22:03:18 Trump also took a hardliner approach on Iran, and announced new sanctions on oil sales to go into effect in November.

1294 2018-09-26 21:59:52 The quality of moklox is amazing. To keep it nice I only used a good conditioner.. brushed a bit of argon oil on it. I no longer use it as my natural hair is long now, but it helped me at the time x
1295 2018-09-26 21:59:43 They asked if I wanted peppermint or lavender massage oil, I chose peppermint now my legs feel burny
1296 2018-09-26 21:59:41 Its a honey colored gel 
And lavender is an essential oil
1297 2018-09-26 21:59:40 Exactly! Schachters' been call'n for oil to tank since at least March '18, is that how it works?? A self appointed "Expert' keeps guessing until a commodity actually does react to the ther're guess??
1298 2018-09-26 21:59:13 You claim you’re unconventional but you’ve never wanked with palm oil before. 

Hmmm.
1299 2018-09-26 21:59:11 Face it the only reason trumps trying to break the deal with Iran is so he will have a reason to attack them for their oil. #msnbc

1302 2018-09-26 21:58:26 So if oil rises to $110 that would shave in worst case scenario 1% of India's growth. From 7.4% to 6.4% 

That still doesn’t look bad

1314 2018-09-26 21:57:58 Trump has apparently saved millions of lives

Q: Will you make a new deal with Iran?

Trump says they will come to him (he must not read their twitter account), he blames high oil prices (that are once again his fault) on #OPEC, and says everyone is choosing US over Iran & China
1315 2018-09-26 21:57:57 That’s looking good too... must be that oil she sold me
1316 2018-09-26 21:57:50 Yes... you are led - by the nose -  by loud snake oil salesmen who lie through their teeth while looking you in the eye, to personally benefit, while the poor, deaf and blind follow like sheep to slaughter. Wake up.
1317 2018-09-26 21:57:44 My favorite squash is in season- DELICATA. It doesn’t have to be peeled, just cut, scoop out seeds, slice in 1/4 wedges, dash a little olive oil, season with salt and pepper, roast at 400F degrees for 30-45 minutes (I like crispy)

1320 2018-09-26 21:57:36 No matter the pain it causes us we can not deal with this idiot president any longer. We need to put massive national security tariffs on all oil, gas, and especially power that is being sold to the US.
1321 2018-09-26 21:57:32 Trump says he wants Irana to produce more oil "I'm not happy with Opec".  Ehhhh Iran is a member of Opec...in fact, was a founding member
1322 2018-09-26 21:57:30 Thoughts I have while pulling into the oil change bay...”I wonder if anyone has ever pulled into the opening area...that would be unfortunate”
1323 2018-09-26 21:57:25 make sure the turbines are all generating a fair amount of power and move things around if other parts of the map looks better >< placing coal or oil power (i cant remmeber) is also an option
1324 2018-09-26 21:57:23 Or Goya oil.

1365 2018-09-26 21:54:36 i don't think so? i think the tools used in oil painting are very clear, a painting is made with paint, but most of the people i know who want to do more traditional work tend to stop just short of picking up materials, since those are finite in a way that digital art isn't

iran has missiles, #hormuz is very narrow, and tankers are indefensible

this is what will happen if the US attacks iran. cannot win
1379 2018-09-26 21:53:51 Maybe some industry expert could inform Trump that the USA is now selfufficient in oil thanks to fracking. So opec raising oil prices is actually good for the USA

1386 2018-09-26 21:53:34 yes knowing from deep research n findings there is oil..also where there is coal there is oil..
1387 2018-09-26 21:53:29 Hope so. I’m ok with my money going to proven revenue generators....the big bad rich oil companies are rich for a reason.
1388 2018-09-26 21:53:24 Expansion joints are however provided at intervals to accommodate the expansion
1389 2018-09-26 21:53:21 Is that true?

I still can't help but be at least nominally wary. I mean, oil and coal are godawful, but even if they weren't bad for the environment everyone knew that the keystone pipeline meant a breach and a spill and when it happened nobody was surprised.

1396 2018-09-26 21:52:19 Concrete is good in compression while steel is good in tension,so to compensate for both, we use reinforced concrete for rigid pavement, not plain concrete, so when its heated up it'll expand which the steel will take care of to prevent cracks

1470 2018-09-26 21:46:28 Sen Graham, hope your are watching @POTUS press conference. He is in the process of making his own case for imposing the 25th amendment. It is hard to believe that anyone can watch this press conference & still think this snake oil salesman is qualified to be POTUS.
1471 2018-09-26 21:46:28 Can't I be both? What gives you the right walking around being both?!

1474 2018-09-26 21:46:21 The US *supports* 70 percent of the authoritarian regimes in the world. How does it decided which ones to sanction, subvert and attack? The US government cares about Venezuelan oil, not its people. Heck, the US ruling classes doesn't even care about the US public!

1483 2018-09-26 21:45:45 Sounds consistent with Shell. It feels like many of the euro majors have truly made the jump to resigning themselves to low carbon, post oil (though not too soon) world. Not all though, and US counterparts, while more enviro minded than they used to be, not there yet
1484 2018-09-26 21:45:38 Today is a perfect example
Slick Willie beard oil from Honest Ape Beard Company - vanilla and lavender

1606 2018-09-26 21:38:08 Brent Oil is at $81. We’re getting $33. The Canadian economy is loosing billions of dollars not selling our resources at the highest price because of lack of access to markets. #abpoli #cndpoli

1612 2018-09-26 21:37:41 The facts are 40% of oil, & roughly one-third of nat gas and coal are from Russia, and Germany's dependence on nat gas from Russia is increasing.

From those facts you draw the opinion that Germany isn't heavily dependent upon Russia for energy, but many even in Germany disagree.
1613 2018-09-26 21:37:41 What would be the repercussions of Russia not selling Oil into the EU? For Russia and the EU? Can Russia use this oil as leverage over the EU if for example it did want to invade Ukraine and not want the EU to respond?
1614 2018-09-26 21:37:26 This particular oil I’ve been using is great but it only comes in this tiny ass bottle that I need to replace nearly every week.

1628 2018-09-26 21:36:33 That was the snake oil he sold his base to get elected. He is only pro-law if it does not involve the multiple investigations he is the subject of.

1631 2018-09-26 21:36:13 Between 6 and 8 percent of skin surface on the average person is composed of pores. This is inverted in the case of Texas senator Ted Cruz, who suffers from contraporexia, causing between 6 and 8 percent of his skin NOT to be pores, explaining why he's always seeping oil.

1637 2018-09-26 21:35:27 Lol. Umm, no. It's because the Fed is ending QE & returning to tighter money (amongst other reasons). 

This dish is excellent when served w/ a giant helping of national debt. And the tax cut. And tariffs. And higher oil prices.
1638 2018-09-26 21:35:17 Anyone know where to get a cheap oil change in chs ?

1641 2018-09-26 21:35:11 T3 Given the rate of demand and changing attitudes it’s likely to be a supportive role - codesign and collaborate - valuing the knowledge shared by the stakeholders - “trust the oil of the future”#irishmed

1675 2018-09-26 21:32:19 One of the pushes is to simply reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, thereby reducing the need to move oil and have pipelines at all.  See if you can find any info about other methods currently used.

1683 2018-09-26 21:31:41 Yeah, I kind of want to get the 98-2004 range, my truck was a 2000 model and I was actually proficient with oil changes, and a few things on it myself without having to pay a place, which is kind of a goal as well. More of a back to basics, and learn to do stuff again.

1775 2018-09-26 21:25:13 We had to increase pump prices then due to global oil prices increase and we being oil import dependent. Nigeria is broke. We are already heavily indebted at an alarming rate. The country needs to cut down it's opex.

1782 2018-09-26 21:24:52 @whatsupibadan  I am seriously amazed at the level of ignorance about Ibadan. This city was once the third largest in Africa and was Nigeria's second city before the oil boom yet a lot of Lagos people genuinely believe its a "razz" place...
1783 2018-09-26 21:24:46 Why does it “need” to be recharged in 5 minutes?  Almost all my charging is overnight, and when travelling, 20 mins is plenty.  Sometimes I can’t even get through a coffee and a toilet break before it’s done.   From my experience, the 5 min requirement is a hangover from oil days

1791 2018-09-26 21:24:19 THANK YOU TESS. I get this so much but I really just use Organix shampoo and conditioner and coconut oil and that’s it. I never use heat. But I do wash it everyday. I really just do the bare minimum.

1793 2018-09-26 21:24:09 I feel like any amount of mmj is enough to make me feel high, but CBD oil definately doesn't. One of our distributers actually found that her migranes went away with continous use. She also makes really good strawberry habenero salsa but that's besides the point

1806 2018-09-26 21:22:19 I get the point but to be precise; NZ uses the gas and exports the oil. Not for much longer as no new exploration, but crude is exported light & sweet, NZ imports medium sour which it refines, some ready-to-use liquid fuels are also imported.

1863 2018-09-26 21:18:00 Agreed, and that was one of the points Kommersant was making. I think a lot will depend on global oil/gas prices, particularly for Yamal's LNG, to determine whether the investment is worth it. But the arctic emphasis has, in some ways, become an end in and of itself.
1864 2018-09-26 21:17:52 I’m not saying I’m scared of mechanics shaming me for not knowing things during oil changes but I AM saying I definitely go to a different oil change place every time (due to shame)

1917 2018-09-26 21:15:00 Would be nice if they’d just be upfront if that was the case. Have the military support oil despite climate change, but not deny it and create their own version of events which isn’t always consistent with scientific facts. At least then there’s honesty rather than politics.

1949 2018-09-26 21:13:03 I disagree there. Once global inventories start falling every week there is going to be a race to bid oil up. And if US shale growth come up short of expectations get ready for a panic run to over 100.
1950 2018-09-26 21:13:02 Well the best way to season a steak is just with oil, salt, and pepper that way you get the full flavor of the meat without intergrating too many spices that take away from the flavor of the meat. I do the same thing with burgers sometimes as well when grilling..

1953 2018-09-26 21:12:48 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1954 2018-09-26 21:12:38 Next time, use fork and knife.... fork, to hold the pepper down on the chopping board, knife, to slice it down... you wouldn’t need to wash your hands with salt or even apply oil.

2280 2018-09-26 20:54:00 Env regs do not alter the amt of carbon that enters the atmosphere, just the local impact. We're discussing global impacts so the amt of energy to produce oil differs. Oilsands has a very high energy cost to produce, so I prefer any cleaner oil for the draw down period.

2468 2018-09-26 20:46:04 Actually not true. If I can borrow cheaper than returns on invested capital, why would I use my own money? Calculating costs for cap gains and loss of tax treatments, this makes sense in many cases.

2473 2018-09-26 20:45:54 I use a dark spot correcting cream, an oil free moisturizer, then use coconut oil to seal in the moisture. Oils do not actually moisturize anything, they are really only good as a sealant because they don’t penetrate the skin, just sit on top.
2474 2018-09-26 20:45:51 up to $4k tax credit for buying electric car, bur for a giant gas vehicle, up to $100k tax break. The oil companies fear @Tesla. Support Tesla, one day they will be more affordable to everyone, and we wont have to rely on blood oil.

2487 2018-09-26 20:45:15 You're pointing to electricity generation. Do you not understand that oil, gas, and coal imports are not electricity generation?

2637 2018-09-26 20:34:43 It's one of the joys of being a woman. One day you can be under a truck changing the oil, the next, in painted nails, wearing a lovely sundress on the beach sipping a drink. Being a girl isn't all bad!

2646 2018-09-26 20:33:55 Indeed, and without wishing to go over this again, british labour in scotland kept their voters the ones they "fight for" day in day out poor in the middle of an oil boom to protect their party in Westminster. Never forget that folk are dispensable to labour. Mere voting fodder.

2660 2018-09-26 20:32:30 Doesn't your analysis suggest that the price on carbon for oil would be largely offset by the elimination of the excise tax?  Since transportation emissions from oil are the biggest area we need to address, why should they get any credit?

2765 2018-09-26 20:24:03 We don't need that oil. Leave it there. First we declassified hunting on a nursery (game preserve) now big oil can get leases to drill and frac. And all the pipelines to scar the land. And the bs about funding the roads and bridges. Why haven't this repairs put in the budget.
2766 2018-09-26 20:24:01 Yup...but with the price of oil thanks to value of £ plummeting and Trump .... we are avoiding putting ours on

2774 2018-09-26 20:23:15 The reason you keep buying is because you've developed a taste for Snake Oil and Bullshit.

2780 2018-09-26 20:22:49 A good start. You should also look into regulating or breaking up the likes of FaceBook, Google, and Twitter, as they are operating as monopolistic news utilities that are unable or unwilling to regulate themselves. Think Standard Oil and AT&T.

2783 2018-09-26 20:22:37 I remember when i first got my car and my oil said 55% and I was thinking of it as bad like a grading scale. I took my car in and got laughed at like I’ve never seen a group of people laugh at me so hard

2790 2018-09-26 20:22:16 Perfectly illustrates (along with Venezuela) that when production is reduced in one country ..the void is filled by oil from another country. Reduction of production doesn’t reduce global production or demand. Simply relocated it....thanks for helping me prove my point.

اذا كانت مو محجبة يعني ( عاهرة ) حتى لو عندها اكبر إنجاز و أكبر شهادة ..مستحيل يمدحونها .
2808 2018-09-26 20:19:31 No wonder you want that "sticky oil" RT @CiciBettaCCMe I need a massage with a happy ending.
2809 2018-09-26 20:19:21 Olive oil is the best moisturizer ever. Removes dead skin and doesn’t clog pores. Millions of Mediterranean women can’t be wrong.

2812 2018-09-26 20:19:05 So almonds are really oily, but when you grind them up fine, most of that oil leaves the structure - you have to do a lot to refine the oil out of an almond. Ground almonds, or almond meal, is a really pasty coagulant.

2816 2018-09-26 20:18:52 In Greek and Zypries is a Hugh gas field and maybe oil field. That would be awesome for Europe, if we can use this instead of USA and Russian oil and gas. This would maybe makes us more independent and Greek would profit from it.

2826 2018-09-26 20:17:57 You may want to double check your accusation. The bond is from a company that regulates oil companies off shore drill by making sure they are safe and compliant, not profit from off shore drilling.

2833 2018-09-26 20:17:10 It's just a pity that the government doesn't want to do what's right for all those Taranaki people who depend on the oil and gas industry for their livelihoods. The proposal to ban future exploration is already causing problems through uncertainty.
2834 2018-09-26 20:17:10 Sadly, to hear a Mexican former government officer mention an oil embargo makes one think immediately how much it would benefit Mexico...
2835 2018-09-26 20:17:04 I didnt say that. I said it has nothing to do with socialism. Under the government that implemented socialist structures things went well. Poverty decreased. New leadership, corrupt, began to mess with it. And because they were to invested in oil, when oil prices dropped...

2900 2018-09-26 20:10:40 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil

2907 2018-09-26 20:10:13 Obama brought economy back, spurred oil exploration. You give the wealthy tax breaks while ballooning the budget deficit and the national debt by $2 trillion. Cruz is fiscally irresponsible.
2908 2018-09-26 20:10:13 @RepCurbelo's bill is probably the clearest example of a carbon price that oil companies should clearly support, and it would greatly reduce emissions (and no liability waiver James). Whether it reduces emissions *by enough* is a fair question.

2910 2018-09-26 20:10:06 Any plans yet on when the debt is paid in full? King Ralph did what he did with debt at almost a third of what it is now. We can’t continue to bank on high oil prices, we got a spending problem, not a revenue problem.

2921 2018-09-26 20:09:22 True talk @bukolasaraki  but the question is, what happened to the excess during oil boom before @MBuhari 's regime? That excess was enough to place Nigeria railway system at par with Japan or China Mr #GrowNigeria
2922 2018-09-26 20:09:11 Banks like you are heavily invested in big oil. Why not invest in the future of clean renewable energy that creates jobs instead pipelines and fracking?
2923 2018-09-26 20:09:07 Getting an oil change & FOX “News” is on showing the Kavanaugh scandal. Some random guy looks at me & says,” They’re going too far with this ‘MeToo’ stuff.” C’mon guys! Think about your mothers, sisters, & daughters. Every claim should be investigated.
2924 2018-09-26 20:09:02 thats right Alex. some punters dont understand the different stages of tests and purpose.  anyway, #ANGS is way cheap at 35m vs other explorers in wildcat with high risk of duster and no oil discovery as yet.
2925 2018-09-26 20:08:56 How does this compare to the drunk elephant oil?? I ran out and wanna see if this is a good choice for me

2928 2018-09-26 20:08:48 It's like they have a competition going to see who can spit out the most useless, hilarious snake oil. It would be funny, if this wasn't the absolute crap we're fed in place of effective pain medications. It's a joke.

2935 2018-09-26 20:07:41 ...that easy? You know they have to sell their gas/oil to keep the economy going. This means leverage. It's important to trade with everybody to be independent. Trump actually is trying to bully Germany into buying resources entirely controlled by the US and their Arab friends...

It's time to begin shifting away from fossil fuels. The future is more important than my checking account. I am shifting.

2946 2018-09-26 20:07:06 The bottom line is there is no oil drilling in Zimbabwe at the moment. That 25 year knowledge yielded nothing, Makandiwa saw drilling happening.
2947 2018-09-26 20:07:05 Hello! I’ve had T1 for nearly 14 years. And ok, not one I’ve read but a cab driver the other week told me to eat lots of lettuce and olive oil as “it gives you insulin” 
2948 2018-09-26 20:07:01 So the piont I am making is let’s say your morocco and greece now has a tariff on olive oil, you could sign a continuation of the same agreement with U.K. as you currently have amd in doing so have no tariff. So your now cheaper than Greece.
2949 2018-09-26 20:07:01 You're welcome!  I'm currently using the cleanser, moisturiser and oil. Getting my skin wedding ready!

2952 2018-09-26 20:06:52 According to Iran's Central Bank it was $29 billion in readily available funds, $45 billion tied up in Chinese investment projects and the foreign assets of the Iran’s Oil Ministry.

2960 2018-09-26 20:06:27 I'm Greek so obviously I pick olive oil... But coconut is great too.
2961 2018-09-26 20:06:21 I was just wondering if Oil are pumping up Luc for his confidence, or to paint picture of value for trade.
2962 2018-09-26 20:06:19 @Total a major player in the oil industry perfectly understands the reality of the threat of climate change. It's really heartening to see stakeholders take action to tackle this existential threat. Well done!
2963 2018-09-26 20:06:16 There was a time on Twitter when the only picture of dark skinned girls people hyped were thick, naked dark skinned girls with oil rubbed on their bodies. But yeah sure no colorism.
2964 2018-09-26 20:06:15 It's a strange thing to be charmed by snake oil peddled by @peoplesvote_uk with their polling which is both organised and commissioned by..... @peoplesvote_uk

They do make a lot of noise but do not represent the public at large.......
2965 2018-09-26 20:06:13 @Tesco Tesco are using Palm oil in their products, people need to learn, I  picked up some stock cubes, looked at the ingredients, PALM oil was one.  so they must be using it in many things. I made it known in that supermarket, not to buy their products. @GreenpeaceUK 
2966 2018-09-26 20:06:05 Imma have to try the CHI serum I use the Jamaican castor oil
2967 2018-09-26 20:05:57 I'd *love* an answer here. If this is something that someone wants to peddle as a possible treatment, I'd like to know why being in love with my partner hasn't lessened my pain at all. Or is this just more snake oil?
2968 2018-09-26 20:05:53 Wasn't it backed by non-produced barrels of oil? I mean, he was trying to back it by oil which was still buried in the ground. And to top it off, you had to trust Maduro. I wonder if anyone who bought these were honestly hoping for a good investment, or hoping to win favors?

2977 2018-09-26 20:04:45 True I don’t dispute that we are considered occupiers. We should have never gone in there. Perhaps offer them a share in Hydrogen production as possible export to replace oil? Giving a viable option to compete may help stable govt. Provide hope as a partner instead of occupier.
2978 2018-09-26 20:04:45 And I suppose that the oil market tanking when the US and Saudi Arabia flooded the market never had anything to do with it either.
2979 2018-09-26 20:04:32 @GreenpeaceUK Tesco are using Palm oil in there products, people need to learn, I picked up some stock cubes, looked at the ingredients, PALM oil was one. so they must be using it in many things. I made it known in that supermarket, not to buy their products, boycott them.
2980 2018-09-26 20:04:31 I researched hair oil , (impressed myself) bought the good stuff. It's disgusting. I smell like nit lotion now. I've washed my hair twice and blow dried. I still stink 
2981 2018-09-26 20:04:29 my babe bought me a new CBD oil cartridge for my pen 
2982 2018-09-26 20:04:26 I think this has happened in beauty products a lot. Oil of Ulay to Oil of Olay. I think it's now just called Olay. Immac changed to Veet.
2983 2018-09-26 20:03:59 Ya Joe. The Wall was never going to happen. It’s snake oil intended to rile up the racist shallow end of the gene pool that makes up his base.
2984 2018-09-26 20:03:57 We have a shit Ton of oil that we don’t know about yet..
2985 2018-09-26 20:03:50 Thanks! Trex looks like palm and rapeseed/canola oil, which seems fine. Stork has preservative in it, and that's a deal-breaker for me. Also not vegan bc it has buttermilk. 

Great for UK bakers. I have to find similar in the US!
2986 2018-09-26 20:03:33 Yoo this oil got my hair looking shiny black
2987 2018-09-26 20:03:32 I agree that "walking the talk" is an important part of shifting support for demand-side measures - but how can we get support for supply-side constraints? Persuading people that well-paid oil jobs have to disappear is tough.

3020 2018-09-26 20:00:08 Personal finance is snake oil
3021 2018-09-26 20:00:07 Yep, but what happens when Eu has tariffs imposed on them by themselves.. then they will become more expensive.. so then if I was in control of African olive oil I would say let’s take Greece’s uk Market share

3027 2018-09-26 19:59:15 I have spent years in the oil and gas industry. You're a teacher.
You're entitled to an opinion but not your own facts.
Your union brings in radicals like Berman and Suzuki so I'll forgive your complete ignorance on the topic.
3028 2018-09-26 19:59:08 It's' not difficult to work out. 

In 1905 Norway proclaimed independence from Sweden so that meant they have been in complete control of their oil and gas resources in the North Sea.

Oh what could have been for Scotland!
3029 2018-09-26 19:59:00 Rob is on a roll today. He kills three birds plus with one stone. One column and he can defend the oil industry, attack Heitkamp and look like an idiot all at the same time.
3030 2018-09-26 19:58:53 Doesn't Norways economey live off their oil production??
3031 2018-09-26 19:58:44 This girl at work gone tell me if I put oil in my hair it’s gone itch more...
3032 2018-09-26 19:58:30 Hyundai wants my VIN to sell me an oil filter??

3037 2018-09-26 19:58:01 If you don't abuse it the Calphalon can easily last 2 years, even a little longer, in daily use before needing replacement. Even degraded it still performs quite well if you add a little extra butter or oil. Hand washing is the key: Dishwasher will kill it in <12 mos.
3038 2018-09-26 19:57:46 Alberta oil sands? Cat 797? 13-feet-tall tires, weighing 11,860 pounds, each Michelin or Bridgestone 59/80R63 XDR tire costs $42,500 and that's when you buy the full set of six required by each $5.5 million truck. Maybe.
3039 2018-09-26 19:57:40 Jobs. 99% of Americans are 9-5ers. Furthest possible point from any shipping port so INTL trade makes manufacturing and distribution prohibitively expensive. No convertible natural resources at hand either. Chem, Oil/Gas is out. Jobs.
3040 2018-09-26 19:57:39 We are concerned about palm oil production & its impact on the environment. We source 100% of our palm oil from responsible & sustainable sources that do not contribute to deforestation of the world’s rainforests or negatively impact the communities that depend on them.
3041 2018-09-26 19:57:36 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us MORE CORPORATE ABUSE!
3042 2018-09-26 19:57:36 
3043 2018-09-26 19:57:20 Ha ha well it would be fun to have that in a game, even though their is a fire fighter simulator game that also has the "less urgent calls" like basement flooding, trees on road and oil spills on the road you need to clean up, the call you don't see in the news daily.
3044 2018-09-26 19:57:10 This just makes me like him more. You're failure to evolve is not surprising. Keep selling your bs to those who think immigrants are the problem and that clean coal and oil are the answers to energy problems. The rest of us will be critically thinking outside the box #Beto4Texas
3045 2018-09-26 19:57:04 Ik ben niet tegen biogas omdat het lokale energiesoevereiniteit en onafhankelijkheid van big oil bevordert. Misschien beperken tot afvalstromen
3046 2018-09-26 19:56:40 If Barcelona continues like this they will soon hit rock bottom then discover oil  and man united after that...
3047 2018-09-26 19:56:39 Google is the biggest threat to our Republic, which is why it should be broken up as Standard Oil, and Ma Bell were broken up !!! Baby Googles (7 to 50 corporations) would be more independent and a force of Good worldwide as opposed to the current Google "leadership" !!!

3049 2018-09-26 19:56:32 No need to prospect Honorable Minister, there's a man who knows exactly where the oil is, save the fiscus the much needed money by simply asking Prophet Emmanuel Makandiwa to show you where the oil is.
3050 2018-09-26 19:56:25 I think you’d like it! We have a high number of guns per capita but strict gun laws so never see them, and low crime. Definitely a safer and better lifestyle than a lot of countries. Although a bit vulnerable where we are and now finding oil, so all help is welcome Thank you

3055 2018-09-26 19:56:02 I would agree but freaking Virginia only let’s us have THC-A Oil and CBD Oil, so I am a major proponent of both.  As far as smokin I would agree if it wasn’t illegal in which the state I reside in. Marijuana is not a drug, it is medicine.

3062 2018-09-26 19:55:19 Thx. I feel great, had 1 surgery for the biopsy/lumpectomy & going in this friday to check a small mass in my lymph.
Going to kill it w/cbd oil & skip chemo so I have my immune system to help heal. Thankfully I am a distributor of low cost cbd oil, so it won't be  super expensive

3067 2018-09-26 19:54:52 OH: “CBD Oil? You mean Calm Bae Down oil?” Best thing all day.
3068 2018-09-26 19:54:48 Or it is having trouble selling its extra light. It has been having difficulty shifting it lately. so selling the more expensive condensate and using the cheaper oil in its own refineries makes sense.

3071 2018-09-26 19:54:25 So.

What if we create chamois cream that also happens to have THC oil.
3072 2018-09-26 19:54:12 So?  American as well as British and other international oil companies drill all over the world.  What’s your point?  Trump reversed Obama policy and got important pipelines permitted.
3073 2018-09-26 19:53:42 False. You still need to replace the oil filter occasionally.
3074 2018-09-26 19:53:41 That's for sure!

Don't think division among ordinary ppl helps at all
3103 2018-09-26 19:51:08 So, definitely gonna open up commissions soon, had to pay some tolls I missed and I had been planning on getting a couple new tires and an oil change

3112 2018-09-26 19:50:15 I see. Is there no way FG can make this happen? It will boost revenue besides oil and minimum wage can be increased.

I find it one kain that people are asking for increase in minimum wage without talking about how govt can increase revenue
3113 2018-09-26 19:50:14 Colorado has a lot of nice incentives for it. Oklahoma's entire economy is based off of oil and natural gas though, so of course the ROI is going to be shit for solar x3

3201 2018-09-26 19:41:02 Have you ever used ear wax remover? There is this weird feeling that comes with the oil flowing through your ear, dislodging the wax. It feels like a growing foam, like your wax is being rolled around in your ear as it starts to flow out. It sounds almost like rushing water.
3202 2018-09-26 19:40:57 Honestly one of the biggest helpers for my health has been hemp oil and . Works better than any medication I’ve taken so far, and more consistently. Legalization is so important to me now, honestly. I now get why it’s used for chronic conditions. It’s helping manage mine.
3203 2018-09-26 19:40:55 It’s most likely olive oil or grape seed oil
3204 2018-09-26 19:40:38 Word from the unwise: don't buy a Subaru (especially modded) unless you want: random clunks, burning oil, cheap radiators, blown head gaskets, ringland failure, the inability to use a spare tire, etc. Etc. Etc.

3220 2018-09-26 19:38:57 I think this is a fundamental question of law and justice.
At present UK judges are declining to look at the basis of the law - only enforcing high-level details.

Let's face it, if the oil and gas companies have their way the Earth will no longer be fit for human habitation.

3226 2018-09-26 19:38:30 Don't take my advice,  but maybe take a small position and see what happens in the next few weeks going into earnings. I do think there is a possibility equities and oil diverge a bit. Could see them lead and rally, but think there is a bit a pullback still coming first.

3266 2018-09-26 19:34:15 I agree that this PB is wack. It might help to store the jar upside down, so the oil will be settling at the bottom. Big might, I have no clue. 
3267 2018-09-26 19:34:13 Just so they stay away from the fryers.  Naked + hot oil = disaster.
3268 2018-09-26 19:34:11 Do u understand that if the oilsands aren't produced, it doesn't affect the amount used in the world? Therefore, the oil that would have been produced in Canada is produced in a place very likely with much worse enviro regs. Likely Iran, Nigeria, etc. That's your preference?
3269 2018-09-26 19:34:10 It isn't? Also the oil might just be one of the messed up items

3287 2018-09-26 19:32:30 Smh. Because recently expired oil is really not that deep, so I was wondering.
3288 2018-09-26 19:32:29 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
3289 2018-09-26 19:32:19 Do I really need a new car or just an oil change? New car. 
3290 2018-09-26 19:32:08 Hate sitting for oil changes 
3291 2018-09-26 19:32:04 Not surprised. I've been a hold through this last rally. Think oil prices are coming down and likely will take equities with it.

3364 2018-09-26 19:25:14 @VP the Iranian regime has been severely isolated. Everyone knows that regime change is definitive in Iran, only the time is of concern. When Iran's oil exports are cut off by November,

3371 2018-09-26 19:24:38 It's pretty clear what is going on. Specialists will be able to prescribe cannabis flower, resin or oil. It will be considered a Class B drug if smoked.

3378 2018-09-26 19:24:03 There are many choices, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Iraq, USA, Russia etc..., Venezuela and Iran were never the big oil producers for over a decade due to sanctions. When the oil price hit USD145 per barrel, the petrol price in India was 40-45 Rs.

3387 2018-09-26 19:23:14 The answer is less forceful policies. If pain patients can get good results from CBD oil, why not use that? Or acupuncture? Or massage therapy? Instead of cutting options, we should offer more and be open and honest about risks and effectiveness.

3392 2018-09-26 19:22:47 seeing some changes with this eye medication. Blurred vision after doing an eye mask is a sign a healthy amount of oil has been released. This hasn’t happened to me in years.

3396 2018-09-26 19:22:31 I just read an article about hair trends that need to go. And it said "Frizzy curly hair needs to go. Curl cream and aragorn oil are a simple solution." 

AND IM CACKLING bc the only solution to unfrizzy naturally curly hair is a miracle performed by Jesus Christ himself.
3397 2018-09-26 19:22:31 wow, around here I swear they adjust it based on the price of oil with barely a 1 or 2 day lag
3398 2018-09-26 19:22:16 Closing off roads with high walls, cement barriers and not planning for runoff is big mistake. Each area could use pump stations to spread water to fields. Sad all this water wasted and polluted by rubbish, oil and chemicals.
3399 2018-09-26 19:21:58 ok not to brag but I laid some coconut oil in my hair for an hour and then washed it with some Kevin Murphy Angel Wash, then sprayed in some Not Your Mother's leave-in conditioner and I gotta say

3410 2018-09-26 19:21:01 Now, Alberta has to look to oil and gas to bail them out. Now Notley is stuck. She spent a lifetime against oil, surrounded herself with anti oil people, and now has to try to fight for oil. Notice how Ceci hasn't changed his budget, even though the pipeline is stalled?
3411 2018-09-26 19:21:01 Are they hurting? Have you tried essential oils? I had some pain the other night after a long day & mixed some “Deep Blue” oil with some fractionated coconut oil and woke up the next day with no pain at all!
3412 2018-09-26 19:20:54 It was the same kind of snake oil as I*TA, peddling a fake product to big investors who don't know how to evaluate that it's fake. I remember one early player who did that but forget their name (no actual QC at all).
3413 2018-09-26 19:20:39 I don't know if this applies, but when I rescued a pony, he was so full of worms that after wormer, had to have the vet back out to force oil in him.  Turns out that if they have too many, the toxins from rotting dead ones can kill them.  I'd call the vet to make sure?

3451 2018-09-26 19:17:56 By the way, crippling US sanctions on Venezuela are entirely for the interests of 2 private oil companies.
3452 2018-09-26 19:17:49 What makes them even more dangerous in power is that MSM will not cover Dems scandals. Each administration the bias ratchets up a notch. Most people who don't care that much about politics (but still vote) only get one side of the story.
3453 2018-09-26 19:17:45 I think it’s just that once you publicize that you’re with any MLM, people associate you with some of the more annoying people that already sell it.

3498 2018-09-26 19:14:20 Vitamin E oil works well with scars and stretch marks. You can mix it with your normal moisturizer or put it directly on.
3499 2018-09-26 19:14:19 No it doesn't. In fact it's the most stringent in the world.
The U.S. has nothing even close to our spill response plan for BC 's coast.
This is just more interfering from a foreign country that what's to keep the monopoly the have in North America with oil and gas.

3528 2018-09-26 19:12:12 and why is that, hmm? do you think it might have something to do with Americans being scared of what might happen to them in retaliation to their decades of unnecessary wars and wrongful deaths of civilians in the name of a battle for oil?

With import volumes from Venezuela&Iran heading towards zero,& incremental supply from Brazilian offshore fields far too expensive, where will India get its oil from? Could the answer be the USA? If so, how will it impact our geopolitics?

3543 2018-09-26 19:11:07 I remember on one of my geology field trips being taken to a cliff on the South coast of England and shown oil seeping out of the rocks in the cliff. All natural.

3546 2018-09-26 19:10:54 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!

3565 2018-09-26 19:09:33 We paid for 6 Kavanaugh background checks already

So if you take your car in 6 times and the oil is still leaking, do you go back to the same garage?

If you do, then you’re the fool

3569 2018-09-26 19:08:56 That was directed to OPEC. He's done that before and they have literally started producing more oil, which lowers the price per barrel, thereby lowering the price at the pump.

3615 2018-09-26 19:05:23 Yes, or no. Did the 2014 indy campaign say that the oil sums hadn't been included in the tax take calculation? Why did eck raise a legal action regarding legal advice not sought? Come on now - be something the snp usually isn't - honest.

3659 2018-09-26 19:01:41 I’m so glad to be boosting the oil companies by paying more for gas. Maybe we should start a charity for them in case that doesn’t boost them enough.

3728 2018-09-26 18:56:44 But it ties together, the current recurrent expenditures are unsustainable (revenues from crude oil can’t pay the current wage structure) so increasing the wage at this time means short changing the rest of the population. It is a priority call in my opinion
3729 2018-09-26 18:56:43 Hmm really? That news missed my house because I'm paying more for health insurance, more for groceries, more for gas, fuel oil for the house, and my wages have not increased. My little bit of stocks haven't done a damn thing either. But tell me how I'm benefiting.

3745 2018-09-26 18:55:45 Powell gives me a headache by pretending there is no trade war. He does not see inflation spiking. How about 1/2 the goods coming from China going to 10% then up to 25%?  Oil price spiking due to Iran sanctions? Complete disconnect from reality.
3746 2018-09-26 18:55:35 it’s easy to do but you just gotta have the right shit, like an oil filter remover
3747 2018-09-26 18:55:25 Rising oil prices boosting energy sector? Doesn't that mean eventually higher oil prices will begin to choke off the economy? So glad a few oil execs can celebrate as the rest of us pay for their celebration.

3781 2018-09-26 18:52:01 @RichardcSiny718 Other fish oil isn't as concentrated & has NOT been proven to show benefit. Vascepa was the only one that showed reduction of 25%, has literally ZERO side effects besides join paints, does NOT increase bad cholesterol & is cheap (insurance willing to pay).

3784 2018-09-26 18:51:36 The calendula, it makes a nice yellow dye apparently and an oil or salve that’s good for skin inflammation. I’ve not made either of these things before but I’m currently interested in dyeing & @catvincent has turned into a bit of a potions man in his old age.

3792 2018-09-26 18:50:54 Ok Petro dollar. Forget about oil. The age of coal is over, the age of oil is ending. Yes China has big plans. They have built entire cities. They have a working MAGLEV system (which we need in North America too). China wants to be the central power in the east.

3808 2018-09-26 18:49:03 So 40% of the import of both oil & gas came from Russia. So we talk about 20% of the whole energy production. Also the fact the our petrol will mostly refined from Russian oil, will also have an impact, when ever this huge amount will be lost. So In that case we depend on Russian

3818 2018-09-26 18:48:26 you could start by eliminating anyone who has appeared as a pundit on @therebeltv. that should be a standard for your publication that your editor would support. 

then eliminate any employees of industrial companies, like Mr King, that specialize in oil spill cleanup.

3829 2018-09-26 18:47:26 What’s most amazing is anyone would listen to the sellside on oil or gas projections.   And to say 2022 projection for an analyst who won’t even work there in 2020!

3832 2018-09-26 18:47:02 @Ritzcrackers Why would you destroy wildlife, wild places for Palm Oil that adds shine to your product!  This seems desperately wrong!  Please consider excluding Palm Oil from your products and know you are saving forests, wildlife and oxygen for the planet.
3833 2018-09-26 18:46:43 oil from dahlias, or calendula? the latter rings a bell, but I'd not heard of the former.
3834 2018-09-26 18:46:31 just paid 70 dollars for an oil change 
3835 2018-09-26 18:46:24 Got my oil change, car wash, fixed my shattered screen, and got a pair of AirPods hehe finally all this hard work I’ve been putting in finally feels worth it and everything is slowly falling into place 
3836 2018-09-26 18:46:14 I think Marner is a production player and stepped up in the playoffs the others need to bring more of that.  There is a history with Oil obtaining amazing talent but could never build chemistry.  The Leafs trio stepped in and produced together quickly.
3837 2018-09-26 18:46:13 Thanks! The oil was behind a fence, dripping from some kind of... heating device? I'm not sure what it was. A black metal machine next to a restaurant, fenced off from the sidewalk. The poor bird was stuck to the ground.
3838 2018-09-26 18:46:11 @RichardcSiny718 Additionally, every experiment in the past has NOT proven fish oil helps reduce cardiovascular issues. Vascepa w/satins (drugs that made the most money for pharmas) showed a 25% decrease in major cardiovascular events like heart attacks/strokes, which is HUGE.

3854 2018-09-26 18:45:13 No idea. They moved away after oil crashed in the mid-80's.
3855 2018-09-26 18:45:12 Ah facts! Nothing to do with falling oil prices and oil 95% of their exports? Guess nothing to do with printing more money or not getting credit due to high risk
3856 2018-09-26 18:44:53 Scotland is so much more than oil. It's a valuable asset, but Scotland's universities and businesses, it's heritage and land, it's welcoming attitude and pragmatic inteligence, should make 5million people prosperous.

3865 2018-09-26 18:43:55 @RichardcSiny718 Can't find your reply, although I see it on my phone. Vascepa is not just another synthetic fish oil. Other fish oil you buy from ANYWHERE will increase your bad cholesterol. Vascepa does NOT increase bad cholesterol. Like comparing diamonds to glass.

3869 2018-09-26 18:43:46 I know, that you Americans maybe had enough oil to drive your cars, but we didn't have any oil, we depend on imports. And fuel will be mostly produced from Russian oil. So alone that would crush our economy or had a huge impact until we compensate the lost. So that's a dependency

3902 2018-09-26 18:41:00 In fact @Conservatives are morally barren and Christianity is dubious, and as slippery to define as fresh oil paint. @Conservatives ... Conservatism and Christianity can be morally twins, yet @UKLabour Christianity is morally positive. Same bible different conclusions. Weird.
3903 2018-09-26 18:41:00 CLON and PET hold licence in highly prospective TANO basin in Ghana. Next to Tullow Oil's Jubilee field which produces 100,000 bopd. They've had issue with the licence but looks like its sorted and they both raised cash off the spike. Tiny mcap and board hold stock.

3905 2018-09-26 18:40:57 Hey Andrew, you like so many discount the fact that we are getting next to nothing for our oil (lowers Fed/Prov royalties) cause it is land locked, investment $ has left in droves (=jobs in case you need an economics lesson), it isn’t just about BC, it’s about ALTA & Canada.

3907 2018-09-26 18:40:51 So not a fan of public roads. schools, police forces, fire departments, medicare, social security, the military etc? Those are all socialism examples. Venezuela is shit because the oil companies do not like Venezuela taking control of their own oil.

3916 2018-09-26 18:39:59 yes, that "would" be great. But with our population and tax base, I'm not sure we can afford that. If Russians want to roam the arctic underwater, good for them. If they land and start piping oil, then we kick them out the old cheap conventional/manual way.

1) What % of CBD oil does the effective stuff contain?

2) For folks who can only get hold of the 3% CBD oil, could we just up the amount taken?

3926 2018-09-26 18:39:28 What? The 40% are not anyones opinion. So you basically mean, that 20% lost of the energy production, which is the same as currently will be consumed, has no impact on the economy. Russia imports from all countries the most gas and oil into Germany.
3927 2018-09-26 18:39:19 yea i spilled cuticle oil everywhere and on my hands and i can’t get it off what of it

3941 2018-09-26 18:38:08 Nah man! Fried chicken objects to this statement!! Just keep the flame low, around 3-4/10. Never put the heat above halfway/medium for prolonged periods. & never walk away. A good oil boil is a vital part of a complete arsenal of cooking techniques. 
3942 2018-09-26 18:37:59 You lot tolerate/defended Gülenist FETÖ TERROR, shared & gave credence to Russian fake news that Turkey bought ISIS oil (in truth as he now does with PKK supplied oil, Assad bought that ISISoil to keep the lights on in Damascus), and blackfaced Turks who didn’t toe the NATO line.

3951 2018-09-26 18:37:12 It's always based on demand and supply. Sanctions on Iran are pushing up prices. A key reason for the drop in oil price previously was due to the U.S. Shale boom and pumping out more oil then they could shift. Stockpiles were ridiculous.

That does make me wonder though, where does one find a bird stuck in oil? A pool of oil in some random gutter? I don't think I've ever seen enough oil to trap a bird, though maybe I'm overestimating how much oil that is.
3991 2018-09-26 18:33:19 Oil could face either a country shock, if one country stops producing as much, or a technology shock, if estimates don't work out. Both could produce a big increase.

4022 2018-09-26 18:30:45 BUT if real CBD oil were available, the story may well be different #MHQT

4029 2018-09-26 18:30:19 Yep. And now put 40% of gas and 40% of oil which are imported from the Russian. This makes 20% of the whole energy consumption. Yeah, I would said, we depend on Russian, because without we had currently no way to compensate this. It would crash properly our economy. Awesome facts

4152 2018-09-26 18:20:58 Oh he’s “different” all right. He’s a snake oil salesman who told people what they wanted to hear. True to form @realDonaldTrump got into office and turned the Presidency/ White House into a good old boys club. Defying every common decency is his legacy.

4170 2018-09-26 18:19:45 Thanks Billy - I've met some of the guys involved in this work.  It will be interesting to see if any of the law suits stick. I suspect the oil industry has too deeply infiltrated governments for it to work in the same way tobacco litigation did.
4171 2018-09-26 18:19:40 Where are the wind and solar projects Germany produce is about 80% of their own power why do we have to keep digging for more oil frackingWill eventually ruin all water sources we need solar solar solar wind wind wind
4172 2018-09-26 18:19:27 Have you ever seen a canola plant? Canola oil, being touted as “heart healthy,” is derived from the Canadian rapeseed plant. Recognizing that “rape oil” was not a good marketing tactic, this invention was given a new name as a combination of “Canada” and “ola,” which means oil.
4173 2018-09-26 18:19:26 I feel bad for all these kids in secondary school.. thinking that life goin’ be like what you read in them novels...
“Ade graduated from the university and landed a well paid job with a house and car from a leading oil company as a manager” Or some shit like that.
Happy dreams

-Masturbate while you’re doing it
-Use good lube, like ID or Gun Oil
-Keep using your toys semi-regularly till you’ve become accustomed.

4177 2018-09-26 18:19:07 Sounds like more than a few people are just as guilty, complicit IF any of these claims prove out.
Given the elite nature of the schools, where are the rest of these people today? What high positions do they hold? Are they fit if they attended same parties?

Macron @EmmanuelMacron n other French octogenarian are abetting a genocide in SCameroons. Macron has endorsed Paul Biya of 86yrs who has ruled for 36yrs. Shame, the French n UK  govts r blocking the UN due to oil deals. France is an extortionist in Africa. Wake up Africa
4180 2018-09-26 18:18:44 We cannot continue to use "Oil Money" to pay civil servants salaries & wages. Let's stop deceiving ourselves. Where is the Oyillluu? It isn't in any way profitable. State Governments must figure out a way to pay their wages... Wahala is coming...

4195 2018-09-26 18:18:20 Having a different PCE and core PCE forecast is basically the Fed making a call on the price of oil, right? Seems weird
4196 2018-09-26 18:18:17 Fyi....baby shampoo works great, has balanced PH and it is economical. A soft scrub brush removes excess fur and stimulates the skin's oil glands to bring out a shine. Dremel for the nails and a liquid ear cleanner...all ready for the show ring. Our wash and wear dogs!
4197 2018-09-26 18:18:17 The oil and gas industries in Canada have a huge impact on climate change by increasing our carbon footprint. How many ecosystems can this affect and how does it affect us? How do we fix it?

4199 2018-09-26 18:17:58 And the pipeline barely even benefits Alberta. Nevermind anyone else. It will really only benefit a few oil companies and their shareholders. Not workers, they are eliminating as many of those as fast as possible.

4202 2018-09-26 18:17:28 The look on people’s face when I tell them I know how to do an oil change, change a tire and do brakes is hilarious  like I know a little bit, cmonnn

4210 2018-09-26 18:17:00 The article states that $3.67 billion in subsidies is spent on oil and gas. What about indirect subsidies of air quality and health? The licence to pollute means we all agree to increase our susceptibility to smog, acid rain, cancer, etc.., but policy seems to forget those costs.
4211 2018-09-26 18:16:55 Those two products I’ve recommended are after trying several. These are my go to staples. Oil for daily and frogs for break through.
4212 2018-09-26 18:16:55 Like draining Scotland of its oil revenue?
4213 2018-09-26 18:16:54 After dismally failing the legitimacy test I’m not confident that any choices made by the regime will positively impact econmy. Venezuela have massive oil reserves but they languishing in poverty.

4223 2018-09-26 18:16:20 I reckon oil co’s would prefer a federal policy that includes language holding them not liable for any future climate damage (as has been proposed by some). But, indeed, support isn’t necessary, though it helps grease the wheels, if you will.

4273 2018-09-26 18:12:12 I happen to agree w/, @SenateMajLdr. He & 21 guys are not best equipped to question Dr. Ford. They’re also ill-equipped to legislate effectively regarding #climatechange & #science. How about my friends & I come do other parts of your job for you? I’ll question oil & coal execs.

4285 2018-09-26 18:11:22 Hmmm... a shame that you decided to go this way. DNA tests as as source of "family history" have been discredited in a variety of reputable journals. This sponsorship will only add legitimacy to another peddler of snake oil. You might as well have gone to astrology.
4286 2018-09-26 18:11:18 Where do you work at do you do oil changes
4287 2018-09-26 18:11:15 Snake oil shumer is scared  of the hearing tomorrow. Looks like no proof on Kavanagh. What bullshit. Innocent until proven guilty. That's the law.
4288 2018-09-26 18:11:14 WOW.... you are on the record speaking about OIL and NOT GANG-RAPE?? Are you listening to yourself ignore these women? @lisamurkowski  stop and think about these victims!

4300 2018-09-26 18:10:23 Hello, he was asking about fish oil capsules from another brand. My point is that liquid form is usually better as you get more for less money. And I trust Nordic Naturals much more than HSN

4310 2018-09-26 18:09:38 i know, right? I mean, it works so well everywhere else, like visiting the doctor, or getting your oil changed at the dealership without an appointment. Why wouldn't it work with a Senator?

4313 2018-09-26 18:09:34 Yes, @POtuS @realDonaldTrump, the public IS very smart. We can see through the snake oil that you keep trying to sell to America. Your base might be gullible, but the rest aren't. The world is literally laughing at you!

4314 2018-09-26 18:09:33 I agree with this! Seems to me they need to lower shot power
4315 2018-09-26 18:09:32 The oil and gas industry is subsidized in the multi-billions annually. And then there's the added costs of pollution, AND carbon emissions propelling climate change. We, as taxpayers, bear these costs and it's not right no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on.
4316 2018-09-26 18:09:25 I haven’t had an oil change in a good minute. 
4317 2018-09-26 18:09:24 That and the BP Oil spill from Deepwater Horizon killed hundreds of miles of sea grass that used to be our natural filtration system in the Gulf of Mexico but never mind no one reads this shit anyway.
4318 2018-09-26 18:09:21 Is there a more satisfying feeling than driving your vehicle right after you change the oil?

4322 2018-09-26 18:09:11 Use a good wash that doesn't dry out the skin underneath the beard. Stick to all natural ingredients in all your beard products. Generally, you'll want a beard wash, beard oil, and either beard butter or beard balm. At the minimum, beard oil and a beard comb or brush or both.
4323 2018-09-26 18:08:56 Interesting to hear from your current speaker that THC has been shown to increase anxiety while CBD has the opposite effect - that makes CBD oil seem like something I could be trying

4326 2018-09-26 18:08:25 US has isolated itself. I see UAE will come out. US wants low oil prices by increasing oil production, OPEC refused it, KSA cannot afford low oil prices as their economy cannot sustain it any more.
4327 2018-09-26 18:08:19 I don’t think that word means what you think it means. Snake oil salesmen DIDNT have facts and DIDNT have evidence. They just shouted loudly and prayed on the people’s ignorance and insecurities. Hmmm who could that description belong to?

4329 2018-09-26 18:08:11 They do. Why do you think Trump restated his coal plants and is now the biggest producer of oil? 

The USA is energy independent.
4330 2018-09-26 18:08:03 Just like money Trump raised through his non profit earmarked for veterans went to his campaign fund. Trump and Trump Train, current versions of snake oil salesmen.
4331 2018-09-26 18:07:59 Wish trump would stop all this “winning”. It’s killing my wallet! Inflation!! Oil at 4 year high. Other countries laughing at us like they NEVER have before. STOP!!!
4332 2018-09-26 18:07:50 Please oil my wheel.  The squeak is driving me insane. Please just oil it!
4333 2018-09-26 18:07:48 I was getting gas for $2.00 at one point. my groceries were abt $10 - $15 cheaper as was my oil bill. not sure how you define "winning" but $$$ in my pocket says it all for me

4337 2018-09-26 18:07:35 FOMC seems dull to small dovish to me. Will just watch this for next 30 mins, first moves are normally not the whole truth. Like Gold on this FOMC though, and Natty/Oil shorts working ok the last 1 hour
4338 2018-09-26 18:07:15 I think it's foolhardy.. Inflation will only rise up to meet the increased salaries 

Hell, Oil revenues were not enough to pay salaries in 2017
4339 2018-09-26 18:07:15 @bouldercanyon I just wasted a dollar on your terrible chips. Looked like they had been soaking in oil for months and the bag had two clumps of chips all stuck together #NeverAgain

4356 2018-09-26 18:05:47 Ah yes, the good ol Norway comparison. The country that is  1/3 the size of Ontario, has 1/3 the population and is sitting on a ton of oil.

Someone, anyone, tell me where you go to in the QC to purchase CBD oil.

4405 2018-09-26 18:00:58 I felt well enough to fulfil a promise & spend a v.slow hour with Dad clearing his garage shelves. It wasn't hard work, most of my input was convincing him he didn't need stuff & it should go to tip  old paint, rags, bits of wood or motor oil anyone?

4533 2018-09-26 17:49:52 Yes, IMF is to blame for much, i.e., Jamaica, but the newest iteration of USSR - Russian-Fed is maneuvering much around 21st century Comm/Socialism, positioning oil and narco trade for its own benefit.

4543 2018-09-26 17:49:07 I always use a few drops of TeaTree essential oil, mixed with a tablespoon of almond or sunflower oil, rubbed onto chest & back. Better yet, get to a registered aromatherapist. Aromatherapy works fast.

4546 2018-09-26 17:49:00 Interestingly, Japan had a waiver under previous sanctions for years  and was a big$$ loyal customer of Iranian oil, even at the worst of times. Japan asked for a waver again from the US and was denied and will now comply with US sanctions on Iranian oil for the first time ever.

4552 2018-09-26 17:48:45 It’s irrelevant. The media can pat themselves on the back, Theresa May can threaten more “sanctions” - but ultimately Putin will still go on bossing the world.
No action will be taken and then we will still buy gas & oil from the Russians.

4565 2018-09-26 17:47:39 Just add little turmeric while mixing the sooji. Soak it in oil. Rest it for at least 6 hours. And your dough is ready. Make sure you get super extra  fine Sooji.

4591 2018-09-26 17:46:02 @narendramodi why is India backing up from not buying oil from Iran. What are your backup options. I guarantee oil prices rise in Nov 18 with spike in $ rates.

4661 2018-09-26 17:40:33 For people who don’t know anything about cars (me) it’s a war of attrition every time I go for an oil change when it comes to upselling. 

This time I only caved to buying one extra thing I didn’t understand as opposed to 3 or 4. That’s a victory.

4672 2018-09-26 17:39:53 Yeah, Peak Oil was dead when the Oil Drum closed shop. EROI is more interesting and rigorous but ultimately the Peak Oil to EROI pipeline is really suspect ad hoc reasoning trying to save an idea that doesn't hold.

4679 2018-09-26 17:39:37 You will love it. I would probably suggest not to use any more than about a teaspoon and 1/2 of oil. The sesame oil and soy sauce leaves a lot of liquid in the pan. Let it cook down slowly so it evaporates. It was SOOO YUMMY!
4680 2018-09-26 17:39:31 Venezuela policies all depended on oil price. The whole country was a one trick pony and it broke all 4 of its legs the moment the oil price fell down. They already sold some % of the oil company to chineese, it's just a matter of time before China buys the whole company.

4749 2018-09-26 17:34:39 They call THEMSELVES Ditto Heads. Socialism (word has been demonized by Fox) ~ it just means "for the people." Means health care for all, means our tax money is spent on US, for education and infrastructure instead of the richest 2%, lobbyists, big pharma, insurance, NRA & oil.
4750 2018-09-26 17:34:39 Taxable bond losses remain the prime culprit for higher municipal yields: the 10yr UST breached and held above 3.00% last week, afflicted by heavy corporate bond issuance, growing potential for a gov't shutdown, rising oil prices, and inflationary effects of a nascent trade war.

Anyone - Yen, Dollar, Sterling  (although I'd avoid the £ if it's no longer underwritten by Scottish oil reserves!)

Panama uses the dollar.
Ireland's pound was tied to Sterling for decades.

4765 2018-09-26 17:33:20 and why do you fear those things?, Iran had a democratically elected government in 1953, then we UK and US put a dictator in power over oil

4772 2018-09-26 17:32:54 Nobody wanted the pipeline because KXL is a more efficient way to get oil to the Gulf coast refineries.  There are no Asian customers. Nobody wanted to invest even with guarantees. 

You haven't said anything that is true so far. I don't expect you to start anytime soon.

4775 2018-09-26 17:32:44 I only listen to proven facts. The rest is hypothetical jumbo-jumbo. There is mostly hypothetical on this and LSE. Day traders and others sucking away the investors cash. I wonder about the identity of those suckers.

4883 2018-09-26 17:25:17 Evrytime I go to get an oil change they wanna find something else... I just bought this car I shouldn’t have no problems.

4893 2018-09-26 17:24:32 DAILY DEATH! Sep 26, 1942 - Lawrence P. MClellan walks into the office of his boss, James T. Wood, Jr at the Texaco Oil building (now the @AceHotel in L.A.) and opens fire before turning the gun on himself. Wood escapes with injuries.

4921 2018-09-26 17:21:57 Great point.  Putting more pressure/spot light on him.  1st PP. Key to Leons line, with Leon as #2 C key to Oil.  Acknowledges was too slow & not agile to start with.  Maybe that's the objective though.  Give him everything to win, but if stumbles can't say you didn't try.

4929 2018-09-26 17:21:22 I had no idea that happened! Gah. For a safer alternative, you can mix quality lavendar EO with a base oil as a good lash booster.
4930 2018-09-26 17:21:22 Much more than Bombardier and Toyota combined. Tax credit gifts worth billions a year, grants, practically free royalties, the purchase of a pipeline.... 

We need to transition away from oil, whether you like it or not.

2) telecom became internet

5) money is happening via blockchain

4941 2018-09-26 17:20:36 The Oilers (at least the media) are heavily believing in their 2018 1st round pick Bouchard, kinda reminds me of the decade of darkness. If the first 9 games don't go good I hope Bear is traded to a good team by then so the Oil will realize what they already had. #Bear #Oilers
4942 2018-09-26 17:20:35 Honestly......NO!!! But they will try to spin just about anything these days. Apparently they missed the shots of the Germans laughing at him even after that. And he wasn’t saying anything remotely funny. He was talking about the Russians and their oil supply.

4971 2018-09-26 17:18:01 In the market oil prices normally inflate with the accumulation of stock where as solar is vice versa and has now deprecated to less than that of oil per equivalent amount of energy. As well as how much of that electric bill is affected by solar tariffs I wonder??

4975 2018-09-26 17:17:39 hmm.. someone didn't set the timer or the oil is old and so it looked done outside but wasn't even 1/2 cooked. Either way that's crazy.

5134 2018-09-26 17:05:47 I wonder if this snake oil salesmen would feel the same way if it was him being accused?
5135 2018-09-26 17:05:45 Nothing proven. Some oil proven but extent and potential without fracking is unknown. Your bucket is half empty, not half full.

5141 2018-09-26 17:05:07 No, the oil industry is the establishment.  Thanks for the kind words.

Fighting @elonmusk's tax-subsidized corporate, consumer and securities fraud does not equate to dismissing the green movement.  Many cannot differentiate between ostensible impact-driven investing and fraud.

5154 2018-09-26 17:04:08 I think it will mean that heavy oil and light oil will trade much closer together, rather than further apart as being suggested by analysts.
5155 2018-09-26 17:04:08 Perhaps we could fund clean energy if we had a solid income and revenue from the oil and gas industry first.  It's planting the foundation for a green future.  The pipeline will create more tax money for our gov to invest smarter for our future.

5198 2018-09-26 17:01:20 The point isn’t to reopen the pits but to build new industries to replace them. Should have been done in the 80s instead of blowing all the oil money on tax cuts for the wealthy.
5199 2018-09-26 17:01:18 Yeah, she is pro oil, Alaska is conservative and she probably has some dark money backing her but she won as a write in against someone to the right of her who the Republicans sponsored. So also that.
5200 2018-09-26 17:01:15 Well the Texas oil and gas biz has been a little down for a few years now and Trump telling the Saudis to increase production so higher gas prices wouldn’t piss off his base, didn’t help either

5258 2018-09-26 16:58:33 Its obvious the BLM caters to oil companies , mining cos. & ranchers who are well funded . The BLM needs to b revamped with at LEAST  50% of employees who Care about Wild life . These horrific roundups that mutilate, break bones, kill & cause Mares to abort have to STOP!

2) we didn't steal we exchanged. The reason why Venezuela crashed is because they had a single market economy with no real preparation for adapting. This caused their economy to collapse when oil prices went down.

Consider: 

A) Energy in one bbl oil equivalent to 10 man-years of phys labor @ 8 hrs/day

B) W/ just-in-time supply chains, Western inventories of everything are microscopic.

•We’ll export oil
•We’ll achieve 6 Regions Federation

This’s what I liked

I wish his speech writer used less profuse thanks&
less tinned vocabulary&prose

Prez’s forgiven for not mentioning how Yemenis’re crying for lack of light at end of tunnel
5596 2018-09-26 16:37:28 I will not be voting labour..... love what he said

Why? Brexit. All on the table means nothing. No deal brexit is an existential threat to uk. No food no oil no electricity no aeroplanes no ships no nuffink. Why does JC not get this? Fine don't like EU. But crash out? REMAIN

5622 2018-09-26 16:33:38 No better investment I've made than a Lodge cast iron chicken fryer, candy thermometer and peanut oil filter/container. Takes a bit of trial and error to get the hang of it but then you've got better fried chicken than eating out.

5626 2018-09-26 16:33:03 As I suspected, the LCA parameters do not include secondary sources e.g the difference between fuel from renewable energy to manufacture paper bags and and fuel from oil feeding oil- based derivatives. Big difference - ignored.

5629 2018-09-26 16:32:41 What is a reliable source to learn what these numbers and various news does to effect price specifically for oil.  I trade oil much better than emini, but don't know when to expect the spikes and thinking I need to get more in tune with this market
5630 2018-09-26 16:32:15 I always think I’m really independent until it comes time to change my oil and I have to call my dad and ask him a bunch of questions bc the shop guy confuses me
5631 2018-09-26 16:32:05 This is trouble. Republicans can’t fight fair and lose. Like Russia. The only way for Russians to win is to cheat.  Not honor nor valor just cheat. Psycho action no empathy. Just be bullies and now it’s a contest to see who can suck the most oil  out of the earth. Vote blue.
5632 2018-09-26 16:32:02 It seems to be the same here! However I'm a sucker for a coat of Coconut oil. The tan can last 6 months! Prior to my LC/Carnivore eating habits soreness was guaranteed.
5633 2018-09-26 16:31:58 Oil change should be the most expensive thing. The rest is covered by a service contract, so should be fine.

5635 2018-09-26 16:31:48 I, too, am paying 900 rupees for kitchen gas but I would prefer this to the country being saddled with 60,000 crores in Iranian oil debt by the UPA (That has now been repaid by the NDA).
5636 2018-09-26 16:31:46 Lets wait until tarifs and sanctions are changing prices and average Joe notices that in his budget.
Wait is oil not already at a high partial because of starting sanctions on Iran limits the supply.

5638 2018-09-26 16:31:41 Murkowski is no good. She doesn't belong in office. She's a total 'sell out.' She sold out the Alaskan people and pristine Alaskan lands to oil drilling companies. Don't expect anything decent and good from her!
5639 2018-09-26 16:31:38 At UN 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Former HC Mary Robinson alleges knowledge of risks from coal and oil by corporate interests that kept them silent.   When she was HC, "I made no speech that mentioned climate change."  No excuses now.
5640 2018-09-26 16:31:32 You are a bit ignorant. Carter was a peanut farmer, Risenhower was a General, the Kennedy family were Bootleggers, Reagan was an actor, Bush Sr. Was an oil exec, Clinton was a rapist, Truman was a shopkeeper, Trump was a developer. This is the Real World.

5666 2018-09-26 16:29:04 I used to think oil money would make it possible to avoid that outcome. But that assumes a bare minimum of service delivery to bind the periphery to the center. Not so sure of that anymore.

5721 2018-09-26 16:24:11 Maybe clever. Maybe desperate. One Belt One Road looks to be a debacle, as it doesn't work in pieces but only as one. If even a reasonable amount of manufacturing leaves China now with oil over $80, the man in the street may be getting a little itchy.
5722 2018-09-26 16:24:08 Noticing higher prices at the pump? AAA says fuel prices in Nebraska are 35¢ higher than this time last year, 37¢ in Iowa. Rising crude oil prices and refinery issues are to blame.

5725 2018-09-26 16:23:51 @AllenLone what's happening with $70+  us  oil? V.moo ? #answers #oil #worstceoever #promises #overpromiseunderdeliver
5726 2018-09-26 16:23:42 Great podcast about essential oils @wendyzuk. With essential oils I find that it can be challenging, listening to people who believe that they are the cure all for everything.  I was skeptical about the peppermint oil at first but after doing some research the evidence plays true
5727 2018-09-26 16:23:37 hmm herbivore's lapis oil or sunday rileys UFO oil???

ive been a huge fan of the UFO oil for years now, but its $80 for 35mL and the lapis oil is $72 for 50mL 
5728 2018-09-26 16:23:36 Its better than bags. Bins I can live with. They don’t split and leave umskah and oil everywhere...
5729 2018-09-26 16:23:32 But unfortunately @EPAAWheeler spent most of his time @NCEWConf talking about “clean coal” and innovations in oil and gas and a bumper sticker he had as a kid: “Nuclear power plants are built better than Jane Fonda.”
5730 2018-09-26 16:23:22 nobody is a trusted partner when it comes to international relations . Every country has the right to go with its national interests , we r not a puppet .We r a developing nation nd need cheap oil that iran was selling to us,still for the USA we agreed to reduce it considerably
5731 2018-09-26 16:23:19 Indeed. Which is how we know our government engages in war for oil and doesn't really care about defending human rights.
5732 2018-09-26 16:23:11 Come SUN Bingo get rid of that fucking annoying large woman who keeps saying oil are going to bingo I fucking hate your advertising git rid now from the tv schedules straight away

5735 2018-09-26 16:22:59 Two day count down till new episode. You'll get to see the rare mix of Charmers and Police. It's like water and oil, or werewolves and silver or Fio and an uncovered face.
5736 2018-09-26 16:22:47 Actual RECORDS are involved here. If you work in ANY area of the oil industry, right down to the gas station, voting for Beto is like voting for a punch in the face. Massive new taxpayer subsidies to prop up wind & ethanol is a sucker's bet.

5738 2018-09-26 16:22:33 Just a reminder for all of Our customers to bring in your Olive Oil And balsamic  bottles for your refills no hurry we close Dec 23rd but I know most of you forget do  your refills ...
5739 2018-09-26 16:22:27 Well I go to get my oil changed the guy breaks my air filter.. then I get my nails done and they are already smeared. We’re off to a great start for the day
5740 2018-09-26 16:22:25 My driver told me the last conference in Salt Lake City was for essential oils and one of his passengers put oil in his neck without asking. 
5741 2018-09-26 16:22:12 @talkSPORTDrive @DGoughie what has Hazard won compared to Dele  #Trophies
5742 2018-09-26 16:22:08 The absolute irony that snake oil is probably better for you than most modern pharmaceuticals.
5743 2018-09-26 16:22:05 If you think that there has never been a preference toward non Catholics in the NE particularly the oil industry, you are seriously deluded I’m afraid.
5744 2018-09-26 16:22:04 My car still needs an oil change. I know Nicki Minaj is to BLAME. #NickiStoppedMyBag
5745 2018-09-26 16:21:56 Iranian hell hole? If Harold Mc Millan and Einenhower hadn't have overthrown the Masedec govt in Iran in 1954  to steal Iranian oil Iran wouldn't have been hateful towards the West.. to much interference years ago.

5747 2018-09-26 16:21:50 Idea of abiotic oil from deep layers was sold by US geophysicist Thomas Gold to the Swedes many years ago @AlbertStienstra @bentir
5748 2018-09-26 16:21:44 誤字です
5749 2018-09-26 16:21:43 This example had a bit more oil than it should have...S’s measure the msss of beaker, mass of beaker and oil, then mass of breaker, oil and unpopped kernels, and mass of beaker, oil(?), and popped kernels.
5750 2018-09-26 16:21:43 Actually that would work. It's the oil. It acts as a solvent and loosens the adhesive.
5751 2018-09-26 16:21:33 dude have you seen these little jars of scented oil that soak out through a wooden peg and top damn dude it's like a scented candle that lasts a month
5752 2018-09-26 16:21:33 Like 3 kuffour gallon of anointing oil I will drink
5753 2018-09-26 16:21:25 Try rescue remedy available at Whole Foods. Liquid in a bottle with a stopper. Homeopathic remedy- calming effect. Cbd oil is also supposed to be good but I have not tried it.

5756 2018-09-26 16:21:08 Have been feeling a bit more vulnerable lately. Gonna do some self care after work. Deep condition and hot oil treatment. A really good shower. Light candles. Take off this polish. Its starting to chip. Lavender oil and sage....
5757 2018-09-26 16:21:06 I shouldn't be as upset as I am but I finally got my @Origins Plantscription Renewing Oil for my birthday, 2 days ago, and I've just spilled about 80% on my carpet. You guys know I haven't been in a position to spend money on myself. Maybe they'll send samples or coupons 
5758 2018-09-26 16:21:02 Libya was run much like the state of Alaska- people all got a little cut of the oil action. they called it socialism but it was just profit sharing.

5760 2018-09-26 16:20:57 He isn't that smart, his clients must be gullible to the snake oil salesman pitch also. This guy probably had a late night ambulance chaser commercial before this year and will back to 1 next year
5761 2018-09-26 16:20:56 It's good for war profiteers. The West basically created S.A. - as an oil rich client state. Just the term "Petrodollars" should tell you a lot about the relationship. The world's a racket. Big Money owns the world & religion is one of its tools.
5762 2018-09-26 16:20:42 Y’all ever use baby oil for sex, shits on a whole ’nother level

5764 2018-09-26 16:20:36 Says she of the proud, brave and free culture of Arabia? Or is it the Levant? I get confused. I know one has oil and nothing else. One makes heroin and nothing else. Both kill gays and beat women I think.
5765 2018-09-26 16:20:19 I use the soap in the morning followed by witch hazel and rose water, then at night the soap and witch hazel followed by the vitamin e oil and tea tree oil. I work on a grill all day too so it’s amazing it’s helped
5766 2018-09-26 16:20:17 I didn't even know there was such thing as beard oil
5767 2018-09-26 16:20:14 Stop using palm oil! Stop buying palm oil from companies who are destroying rainforests and wildlife! #palmoil #rainforests

5770 2018-09-26 16:20:02 He is talking about, if you bother to listen, it is about the debt incurred by us to support those countries in the mid East that we protect., that raise the price of oil and live like kings while be sacrifice.
5771 2018-09-26 16:19:58 อ๋ออออ ไม่เป็นไรๆๆ น้องลองหาtea tree oil มาทาดู มันจะค่อยๆลอก ละยุบไปเองง
5772 2018-09-26 16:19:52 Venezuela is the way it is now because of the U.S sanctions that were imposed by Obama. Stop pretending that we’re trying to help when the only thing those in power want is oil.
5773 2018-09-26 16:19:37 FCuking Ridiculous use.... In the east our ancestors primarily used Sesame Oil and Coconut oil to light up their lives and nights.... Sad for these great animals... #coconutoil, #sesameoil, #Brutalhuman, #AnimalRights, #barbaric
5774 2018-09-26 16:19:31 Just driving my car after getting my oil changed at Valvoline and literally 5 minutes later I hear a Valvoline commercial. I have an older car that can’t connect my phone... so wtf
5775 2018-09-26 16:19:27 McDonalds chicken nuggets contain silicone oil, which is a synthetic material used to make contact lenses, caulking, and lubricants.
5776 2018-09-26 16:19:26 Bought a vape pen to hit some sweet CBD oil and watch Maniac  HMU players, this is how you live life
5777 2018-09-26 16:19:17 Good point. Has he tried collecting the old cooking oil from the local chippies and straining it through a pair of tights?

5781 2018-09-26 16:18:52 おやすみなさい(-_-)zzz
5782 2018-09-26 16:18:51 Fairly standard nonsensical logic.  I’ve pushed other friends to identify the examples of ‘European’ government they are most dissatisfied with & of course they haven’t got a clue!  Just believed xenophobic lies peddled by snake oil salesmen like Farage.
5783 2018-09-26 16:18:30 £23 for some oil! Fuck off Halfords you orange twats
5784 2018-09-26 16:18:22 he's gone from whale oil expert to blockchain? Amazing flexibility.
5785 2018-09-26 16:18:15 No, the oil industry is the foreign subversion. We have tons of our own home grown opponents to oil and gas distruction of our environment. And most of those people have rights to the land and it's minerals. 
The only hater here is you.
5786 2018-09-26 16:17:41 $188 for an oil change.... buggginnnn
5787 2018-09-26 16:17:40 Yea they are just shake and go! Lol my hair eats up a lot of oil tho so I have to stay putting oil in my hair
5788 2018-09-26 16:17:24 Beyond their reach and control
5789 2018-09-26 16:17:21 WTI oil at $71.76/barrel, -$0.51.
5790 2018-09-26 16:17:09 Guys GUYS, the trick is to turn it upside down as soon as you get home from the store oil will be at bottom once you flip it over and open to stir, much easier and way less messy (can still be messy pero much more manageable)
5791 2018-09-26 16:17:05 Doesn't some autonomy and more oil afford them some peace and prosperity?
5792 2018-09-26 16:17:04 I need an oil change no whip involved

5795 2018-09-26 16:16:47 Is it possible to light a fire using two stroke oil?  BECAUSE IT SURE SMELLS LIKE ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS HAS.
5796 2018-09-26 16:16:44 Modi Government is totally failure to handle the worst situation of indian economy as the oil prices are too high and devaluation of Indian currency as compared to USD now a days.
5797 2018-09-26 16:16:43 What is your go-to cooking oil
5798 2018-09-26 16:16:39 Getting asked if my brother got me into car detailing. He doesn't even know what brand of oil to use. I don't either but its just mech arts and crafts and I really want to get a Mitsubishi Lancer this spring to mod
5799 2018-09-26 16:16:36 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
5800 2018-09-26 16:16:22 100 %correct. But North Korea doesn't have oil. But why is USA targeting them? It is because North Korea is actually sponsoring terrorism inside USA by using American communists. It is surprising that USA fought communism worldwide but failed to contain communism at home. Irony!
5801 2018-09-26 16:16:09 we knew that long back.zvayi but hapana oil yakawanda

Big Pharma gulped.
Big Oil nodded.
AIPAC shuddered.
The health insurance industry blinked nervously.
“Yes Big Convenience Store/Gas Station” they said in unison.
5805 2018-09-26 16:15:59 i just wanna thank the tweet that attacked me about getting my oil changed lol I finally did it
5806 2018-09-26 16:15:51 Toner - simple

5807 2018-09-26 16:15:35 My oil looks eww I need to change it
5808 2018-09-26 16:15:34 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
5809 2018-09-26 16:15:24 Nonsense. Make Ford go under oath first.
5810 2018-09-26 16:15:23 @realDonaldTrump - thank you SO much for pushing the oil prices up by your reckless policy, making Norway  and other oil exporting countries even richer. This is what you do best - making the rich richer. 
5811 2018-09-26 16:15:20 They would clear it to remove soil that is saturated with oil. They would then replace it with clean fill and reclaim the area once completed.  A reclamation project 100% privately funded. Sounds like a great idea 
5812 2018-09-26 16:15:19 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
5813 2018-09-26 16:15:14 ‘The discovery of oil in that region could fast-track Government efforts to turn around the economy’ lol

But given the institutional corruption necessitated by ZANUPF, this won’t help the economy!
We were handed over alluvial diamonds, easy to mine, what do have to show for it?
5814 2018-09-26 16:15:10 Australian study results suggest that Cinnamaldehyde (CAD), a component of cinnamon oil, disrupts biofilm formation and swarming motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
5815 2018-09-26 16:15:05 This is all looking so coordinated Bob.
Israel handing out oil licenses to Americans, from the Golan Heights they're ILLEGALLY occupying, and increasing illegal settlements on the heights. US deliberately goading Iran, 
It's all as dodgy as f**k
5816 2018-09-26 16:15:01 South Korea? We have huge oil refineries and heavy industries.
5817 2018-09-26 16:14:49 I'm not sure too many people in Canada outside of the oil patch fully appreciate what a huge deal this project is
5818 2018-09-26 16:14:49 By Monday you will enjoy the smell of burning rubber,racing fuel, and burnt oil. Oooh what a smell along with thunder of the engines that you feel down in your soul and the sense of speed. You will be addicted. #NASCAR

5820 2018-09-26 16:14:42 Socialism isn't the problem, having a single source of national income is. 
When oil prices were high, Venezuela was rolling in wealth.
They didn't prepare for low oil prices, lived beyond their means.
5821 2018-09-26 16:14:41 .@Nestle also uses palm oil in their KitKat recipes.

5824 2018-09-26 16:14:19 I think the $QQQ spike last 2 days is a bull trap before FEDS. $XLF banks are down and $QQQ up. We know how the market loves to do the opposite.  I think you are gonna get paid phat like last week. Inflation on oil and trade war plus rates rising. Bad for tech. GL

What after this rise of oil?
Are there future plans to look for revenues other than oil ?
Is not supposed to start the government to invest oil revenues in other sectors
And review projects are expensive The price?

5831 2018-09-26 16:13:29 Try ~$4.50 /day ($1,600 / year) for 4g purified EPA (unless you like a lot of Mercury in your diet). I'm sure the co-pay on Vascepa would be far less and the health benefit far greater than what many spend on ineffective suboptimal dose and purity fish oil supplements today $AMRN
5832 2018-09-26 16:13:21 Jazmin is a  garment mender that likes Olive oil on their sun-dried tomato pizza with rum
5833 2018-09-26 16:13:18 Lil bit of coconut oil!
5834 2018-09-26 16:12:52 In addition, most scholars/econ have concluded the price rise due to oil shock was long term deflationary and goes a long way to explain stagflation
5835 2018-09-26 16:12:47 Bulls like yourself want rates to break down now, if they dont and we see 3.30% on 10s with higher oil prices both the consumer and real estate market is death which will drive a nail through equities.

5837 2018-09-26 16:12:28 ur an angel wow, but this is so true !! also, some other weird things that helped me clear up my acne (even though it’s usually not seen as something to help it) is cranberry and fish oil pills !! idk what they do, but a friend recommended it to me and my skin started to clear up
5838 2018-09-26 16:12:26 Tea tree oil is a goat, face has never cleared up so fast, and stayed clear for so long

5840 2018-09-26 16:12:16 Unfortunately we’ve been trained for decades in this province that “tax” is a bad word and oil will always be our savior. It’s a ridiculous line of thinking but Albertans are a tad bullheaded on this.
5841 2018-09-26 16:12:06 Oil and the economy of hajj are for saudi government and people only. No other country, either Pakistan, Iran or Indonesia or
other countries
5842 2018-09-26 16:12:04 I'm not Canadian so I have no business commenting. But judging by the number of V8 hemi trucks I saw I would say you're way behind the EV curve. I saw 2 tesla's on my road trip from Vancouver to Toronto.  Oil will not die in our lifetime
5843 2018-09-26 16:11:57 Start engineering oil rigs with a zero percent chance of spilling a drop and the tightest safety regulations in history and then we can talk. Oh, and the oil industry will foot the entire bill, not a single dollar will come from taxpayers, including cleanup of spills.

5848 2018-09-26 16:11:28 We that's not to like..he's condescending ..rude..self absorbed..self serving about pretty much anything..a fine catch...ask anyone of his victims..snake oil salesman
5849 2018-09-26 16:11:24 As oil… ima stop tryna paint a picture with folks who are water.
It will only continue to dry up + separate.

As oil I want to create something that is more rich, more vivid + the bonds are thicker.

Last time I checked, water + oil don’t mix.
5850 2018-09-26 16:11:15 So no oil market reaction until the day the payment system goes live.
I disagree.

5851 2018-09-26 16:11:13 Hi Patty, the saturated fat content in our cream cheeze is mainly derived from the coconut oil in the product.  Please feel free to reach out again if you have any other ingredient questions 
5852 2018-09-26 16:10:46 bananas; oats (not just porridge, but as a great savoury or fruit crumble topping by adding some seeds & coconut oil)
5853 2018-09-26 16:10:40 Another major issue is that there are a lot of financially distressed Canadian oil and gas firms and, most of their debt is denominated in USD.
5854 2018-09-26 16:10:34 Just for being early for a oil change I get it for free !! woot woot it’s going to be a wonderful day

5865 2018-09-26 16:09:52 Oil independent that brought untold hardship, hunger and endless war to the people. Those who help them gained independence from Sudan gain it all.....I weep for Africa.

5867 2018-09-26 16:09:45 This girl said a diet change and detoxing can cure autism and I’m so fucking irritated right now over it. Of course her only source was a blog post by a snake oil salesman of a doctor who sells, guess what? DETOXES AND DIET BOOKS AND SUPPLEMENTS
5868 2018-09-26 16:09:43 jajaja
5869 2018-09-26 16:09:35 I always go to our family friend for an oil change but these white people have him booked and busy

5871 2018-09-26 16:09:15 Ima need someone to remind me to get an oil change every once in a while, I be forgetting about allat /:

5873 2018-09-26 16:09:05 Lovely fresh summer lunch, Heritage tomatoes, cold pressed Kentish rapeseed oil & freshly made Burrata, oh the simple pleasures  

Thank you for the share @the_nakered_chef

5874 2018-09-26 16:08:55 I hear it tastes great if ya add sesame oil and soy sauce.
5875 2018-09-26 16:08:53 Great show - think one off the Grand Banks and Flemish Cap sword fishing might be fun also. I worked out that way in the 80’s in oil and gas much larger vessels

5878 2018-09-26 16:08:20 My next oil change date isn’t scheduled til November 3. Why tf do I already need another one before that date
5879 2018-09-26 16:08:18 The last years of the PC's were badly corrupt. No one argues that, that's why they lost. Notley and her anti oil crew and anti coal has done wonders hey?
5880 2018-09-26 16:08:17 That 20% of oil we import is getting in the way. #Venezuela is another example of our failed policy for democracy in LATAM. It's going to take China to open military bases before a geopolitical move is made.
5881 2018-09-26 16:08:11 good things about spain:
it’s sunny and not depressing

people are chilled out
so many nice views
5882 2018-09-26 16:08:06 Damn that freaking sucks, i haven’t had my car long enough to have to pay for an oil change but i know Mel hambelton does a full works package for like 45 bucks.

5884 2018-09-26 16:07:53 Without exception Trump's laudatory comments vis-a-vis Kavanaugh, policies, appointees, his "accomplishments" rely on the typical tropes of a snake oil salesman. He always appears to be doing a hard sell on the condo with the bad view below the health club bar.

5888 2018-09-26 16:07:43 Well said. Don't forget he is advocating for countries to not buy Russian oil, which will be a devastating blow to their economy.
5889 2018-09-26 16:07:42 Nothing sucks worse than waiting at @gatewaytires for hours  for a oil change and three techs are sitting idle the entire time
5890 2018-09-26 16:07:42 Oil Boom, we got lots of new stuff now.
5891 2018-09-26 16:07:41 Oil price needed to balance budget.

Venezuela: $223
Nigeria: $124
Algeria: $105
Angola: $78
Saudi: $87
Iran: $68
Kazakhstan: $60
Iraq: $54
Kuwait: $48
Russia: $40

Current oil price: $82
5892 2018-09-26 16:07:38 Taraku mills used to produce soya oil with high demands locally and internationally, flour for food, d chaff used for producing animal feeds, an integrated factory, wasting. Rather than sell it, d preferred closure for yes now. No business sense
5893 2018-09-26 16:07:22 Just put L* Croi* in my essential oil diffuser
5894 2018-09-26 16:07:18 Home made cottage pie. Except the one I made the other week was pimped up by drizzling chilli oil and scattering charcoal salt over it, which may be missing the point of this Twitter feed.
5895 2018-09-26 16:07:17 And weed was so taboo back in the day. Nowadays my mom admits she was wrong about it but I don’t blame her for it. She truly believed it was worse than heroin because the govt. was very good at demonizing weed during the “Just Say No” era. Now she takes CBD oil for arthritis. 
5896 2018-09-26 16:07:05 Also, where did he get all the money/ technology to fund the military buildup? Surely American and British companies, i.e. Henry Ford, Standard Oil, and AT&T, had nothing to do with it.

5906 2018-09-26 16:05:28 And the IMF loan in 1976 was from a backdrop of a structurally weak economy, a fall in Stirling, inflation driven by oil prices and, not least, net borrowing by the Wilson government having turned a budget surplus in 1970 into a deficit of almost 7% by 1974
But.... Labour, right?
5907 2018-09-26 16:05:26 I'm so old I drink 8 bottles of 2ater each day and have taken CO Q10, along with vitamin E oil soap. And don't take hot showers.
5908 2018-09-26 16:05:23 Walmart North takes it. Canadian Tire South takes it but you have to pay because it takes time for their employees to sort & dispose of it properly (which I think is fair). Check with oil change places. I used to let people drop off at the shop I ran. Better than in the trash!

5912 2018-09-26 16:05:13 Exactly. If these countries wud have got nuclear weapons, no country including USA, Russia, etc will have forcible control over their oil resources. If countries having oil also have nuclear weapons, USA will never mess with them. That's why nuclear weapons are most important.
5913 2018-09-26 16:05:09 Yes- Sco is doing really well in the Green sector. Another plus for Indy. As for oil running out- (of course it is) but to what extent? Unionists will always down play whats out there- they don't want anyone thinking there's a big cash cow available to an Indy Sco.

5963 2018-09-26 16:00:10 The Shi’a vs Sunni dichotomy is fake. Libya , Palestine , Tunisia , Chad  and Niger  are majority Sunni. The USA is committing war crimes in those countries in the name of capitalism and big oil.
5964 2018-09-26 16:00:09 In all fairness, one way to square the two lists is to say that the oil majors are in favor of federal carbon tax but not state carbon taxes that create a patchwork. On the other hand, chicken and egg (you need the state action to motivate the federal). And they know this.

You should know that high inflation through the mid 70s was largely driven by the *global* oil crisis.
Which is why you see high inflation in other countries, you plum.
Or are Labour to blame for that, too?

5974 2018-09-26 15:58:50 Demand begets supply. It’s really that simple. Not the other way around.

5978 2018-09-26 15:58:21 Stop the theft of our oil by American oil companies. Will mean no more poverty in Canada. They are stealing 4 million barrels a day with a profit of around $60 a barrel. That's $240 million a day. Wake up Canadians.

5982 2018-09-26 15:57:53 This is not CBD water... You people are killing me.
Typically hemp oil contains low levels of CBD “less than 25 parts per million” whilst CBD oil can be up to 15% CBD. Both oils hold a place
in our daily health routines. It is important to remember they do have their differences.
5983 2018-09-26 15:57:47 Somebody tell me if there is still a Peak Oil Doomsday Date and what it is.  I think the first one was in the 1990s and was going to disrupt life on the planet.
5984 2018-09-26 15:57:46 We cannot believe their “vow” to do something about global warming for several reasons. They are the political backlash; without them, there is no resistance to life as usual. They are paid to lie. CEOs cannot control oil companies, but a strong US president could.

5992 2018-09-26 15:56:57 The idea that any major oil company, Bank, or western nation state is going to try and start a finance battle with the most powerful economy in the world is just wishful thinking by those that were either hoping to profit from the Iran Deal or hate the POTUS.
5993 2018-09-26 15:56:56 Yes it’s life! I barely use my oven or oil frying. Life changer! Thanks so much!!
5994 2018-09-26 15:56:51 He has embarrassed them with truth on their foolish immigration policies. They are pissed that he calls them out on the money they owe the UN  (AKA US), as well as calling them out for buying oil from RUSSIA and enriching that expansionist government.
5995 2018-09-26 15:56:46 @1a When “Bog Oil”, day, or big pharma donate, they expect a quod pro quote. What does Mr Steyer get, other than more citizens voting? How can anyone object to that?
5996 2018-09-26 15:56:35 So who went to buy those expired rice and oil?? The person should be sack immediately with all due respect...Hmmm...Ghana shall prosper @Blakkrasta @zylofon1021fm #TaxiDriverShow #fellowmates

6002 2018-09-26 15:56:08 Take a day off to get everything done that you haven’t had a chance to do. Like I will take a day off to deep clean my house, get my oil changed, run all my errands, etc
6003 2018-09-26 15:55:53 How old are the scars? Has anybody asked you what happened (other than med professionals) or even mention them? If not, then they’re far less noticeable than you fear. If they bother you (& that’s what matters), try Bio Oil  at night + Dermablend + Dermablend’s setting powder
6004 2018-09-26 15:55:41 #Semlex in new bribery allegation: A former Gunvor employee said he paid bribes to #Congo’s Pres. Kabila via presidential aide and Belgian firm Semlex to win oil contracts. Also paid bribes on behalf of Gunvor to officials and presidential aides to secure #IvoryCoast oil deals.
6005 2018-09-26 15:55:35 How do you account for the oil? Mass of the oil plus kernels before and after? Is the moisture lost in the popping?
6006 2018-09-26 15:55:33 Like registering a Oil Tanker under Panama Flag, Disaster with no liability. Greed before the Fall.
6007 2018-09-26 15:55:29 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans

6012 2018-09-26 15:55:20 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
6013 2018-09-26 15:55:20 There was another mom  telling her daughter that she didn't like the chosen Foods because it would separate after time and I told her that's because it's real olive oil. Worth three effort. Still mad at @Tessemaes for changing their oil!

It is years that Europe and especially France has done a lucrative besiness with Iran! Selling Airplanes ,Cars and even investing on our Oil industry! Thats why you are backing up Iran regim. PLEASE STAND BESIDE PERSIANS Because Iran is belong to Persians !
6036 2018-09-26 15:53:22 I said it years ago imma say it again. Man will become techies as casual as day

The same way you should know how to change the oil in your car you'll know how to fix your computer
6037 2018-09-26 15:53:13 Wow. Thank you so much. This last one at $8.50/L is the one I purchase. What should I look for in Olive Oil? I look for Organic, cold pressed, and also that peppery taste in the back of the throat.

6047 2018-09-26 15:52:24 One more thing do you know each of the three federally recognized tribes in Texas today have no oil in their property? Yeah, and its not a coincidence.
6048 2018-09-26 15:52:22 How about mandatory drug test for congressmen and senators, too.
6049 2018-09-26 15:52:21 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

6052 2018-09-26 15:52:04 Are you enjoying higher gas prices? Trump sanctions Iran, 1.5mil barrels per day of oil leaves the market, gas prices go UP! Can you connect the dots? Are we GREAT yet? How much more of your TAX CUT is eaten? Remember it expires in 2025.
6053 2018-09-26 15:52:00 OpenTable is looking to leverage its scale and experience in restaurants to become a data-fueled recommendation engine for diners and a source of quality intelligence for restaurant operators.

Big Data > Big Oil
6054 2018-09-26 15:51:53 What of the one that will pour petrol and engine oil for you
6055 2018-09-26 15:51:49 What does this have to do with clean energy? The work required to pump CO2 into the well reduces the net energy value of the extracted oil. Even if P > than the CO2 critical point, more CO2 will be created from that oil than was injected into the well. Fossil fuel is not "clean".
6056 2018-09-26 15:51:49 I thought it was just saline and/or mineral oil depending on which one u get.

6061 2018-09-26 15:51:31 Price action is controlled by the network right now... My option actually is emulating the free market more closely than Bitcoin does. What Bitcoin does is essentially similar to what OPEC does to drive up oil prices. It induces artificial scarcity at the worst times.

6064 2018-09-26 15:51:18 Cut in PSDP, 90 billion Rs of indirect taxes, promotion of black economy and increased price of gas, oil, food, toll tax and each and every commodity. Naya Pakistan 
6065 2018-09-26 15:51:18 For a re-seller/producer, price is a major concern.

E.g. palm oil for face creams.

For an end-consumer, acceptable price depends on their personal income.

Gucci bags, for example.
6066 2018-09-26 15:51:07 Also a lot of our customers came back for cleanse and cbd oil before we stopped selling. Organic soaps, shungite, and more.

6074 2018-09-26 15:50:28 They’re all laughing so it must have been when I said that climate change is costing billions in damages and threatens to destabilize civilization as we know it. Or when I said that we need to talk about the end of growth of production in the oil sands.
6075 2018-09-26 15:49:53 Actually, you can wait 20 or 30 years to tell someone.
6076 2018-09-26 15:49:53 it's always about money...follow the oil

6085 2018-09-26 15:49:20 Do you not remember Redford? A conservative? And 40 years of Conservative inaction on finding alternative fuels when the oil dollars were flowing in and there was money to spend on diversifying the economy? How quickly people forget the arrogance of the Conservative party.

6089 2018-09-26 15:49:11 To judge by the current hoopla from promoters – naturally… – this time they got it down. I hope so! Goodbye oil, goodbye lithium. (Hello cold fusion…)
6090 2018-09-26 15:49:11 I could have told you it’s going up, look at the oil price!! Say no more
6091 2018-09-26 15:49:03 #oott  If Iran finds ways around sanctions and continues to add oil to the market, does anyone have a prediction as to what WTI and Brent price will be?

6093 2018-09-26 15:48:46 My car is finally getting an oil change 
6094 2018-09-26 15:48:40 Hey @Eurostar I'll be travelling to France soon and just wondered if you knew about the laws on CBD oil over there. It's not super clear online and all the other places I've asked haven't been helpful. I take it for anxiety and it's completely legal in the UK.
6095 2018-09-26 15:48:39 The guy is a real hard guy, nothing comes in his business way .
6096 2018-09-26 15:48:37 Faaaacts . They make jokes about our bonnets and silk scarves and hating touching it and getting all the oil on their hands and not being able to run their fingers through it and how we look on FaceTime and honestly it’s exhausting.
6097 2018-09-26 15:48:34 Actually she's not accusing...it's worse. If you read her statement it's more of an insinuation...read between the lines.
6098 2018-09-26 15:48:34 DAMN THOSE DEMS for obstructing @realDonaldTrump on promise to make Mexico pay for the wall & TAKE THE OIL that ISIS was stealing from Iraq & Syria LMAO
6099 2018-09-26 15:48:04 And gas is only 20% of their generation, so 35% of 20% . . . it isn't much. And they can get oil from many other places. The German delegation was laughing at his comment. That is all you need to know.
6100 2018-09-26 15:48:02 A few small oil producers.   Even if the oil price comes off a little.  Todays prices will impact Q3 and Q4 results at some point in the future.
6101 2018-09-26 15:47:43 Getting my oil changed these old people so funny 
6102 2018-09-26 15:47:33 IS PRIME MINISTER AND ARUN JETTLY HAS DECIDED SUCIDAL ON PETROL DIESEL ISSUE? STOP INCREASE IN OIL IMMEDIATELY

6108 2018-09-26 15:47:01 He was probably sold on safflower oil because, like canola oil, it's marketed as a healthier alternative to saturated fat. I picked up some of Mark Sisson's avocado oil mayo @Costco.
6109 2018-09-26 15:46:55 I don't think discovering oil is the panacea. Zimbabwe's biggest asset is it's kind, welcoming, hard working educated people. They need to be invested in. We have diamonds yet we have no money or cash to trade.Not to be a scaremonger but this could be a real curse if available.

6113 2018-09-26 15:46:40 my style of homeopathic medicine is taking shitloads of advil and sudafed and then putting eucalyptus and peppermint oil in my diffuser and then pretending that the diffusing did the trick

6123 2018-09-26 15:45:39 Hi Penny! That's a tough one! We would suggest plastic because glass can be reused again and again! You may wish to consider taking the oil to one of the recycling centres in Wyre. Fleetwood and Garstang accept cooking oil or mop it up with kitchen towels.

6126 2018-09-26 15:45:22 Oh@c’mon oil tankers are the same as food tankers and if pipeline goes through, it’ll be the same number of tankers? What are you talking about
6127 2018-09-26 15:44:43 The Grinch ain't gon' be able to hold Olive Oil like a mysterious crustacean will.
6128 2018-09-26 15:44:36 Nachos with everything, and anything korma or tikka masala. (I just discovered flat-bottom woks are ideal for frying pappadums! High heat, perfect size, needs less oil.)
6129 2018-09-26 15:44:30 it's gud thing that America produces its own oil so that it doesn't mess up with the sovereign of the M.East countries

6135 2018-09-26 15:43:18 Maybe not, but, with regard to climate change, the Tories have cut solar subsidies to the bone, prevented anyone, pretty much, from building new onshore wind farms in the UK, refused to support the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon project, ramped up support for North Sea oil and gas (1)
6136 2018-09-26 15:43:18 So True. 
But country refuse to wake up. 
It is hilarious,  in what kind of La La Land people live. And so called leader, keep selling the same Snake Oil.
6137 2018-09-26 15:43:10 I scheduled an oil change for my car and they sent an confirmation to my email but now I’m locked out of my email and can’t see it, I just know it has something to do with @NICKIMINAJ behind the scenes stopping my bag

6170 2018-09-26 15:39:30 And let us not forget the quackery of circumcision. Circumcision is bloody surgery on a newborn baby boy. Unnecessary surgery. Foreskin is not a mistake. The claims for circumcision are another kind of snake oil. #i2 This cannot be ethical.
6171 2018-09-26 15:39:24 With oil, ethanol, housing, and education subsidies, plus a new $1.5 TRILLION tax cut for corps and the rich, the term "public charge" for the poor only can screw right off. We are all public charges, and that's ok.
6172 2018-09-26 15:39:09 Yeah, more and more cars with "green" plate. Subsidy decrease gradually, that's true. But the oil price is rising (last year now 6+ CNY, yesterday I found 7.45￥). The trend will go on in China next year, people benefit form EV & HEV, PHEV.

6178 2018-09-26 15:38:31 Consider the results of history:

Standard Oil claimed 85-90% of the market. Competitors lobbied. By the time anti-trust legislation was passed, they had already fallen below 70%.

"No."  That's the answer.

Police, military, courts. Anything else a government does is bad.

6185 2018-09-26 15:37:52 Hello! Random question time, but when I drain off my cooking oil/fats to go in grey bin, is it better to use a glass jar, foil container or plastic bottle (once cooled). Which of these  has the least recycling benefit so I  can feel less guilty that it ends up in the grey bin?!
6186 2018-09-26 15:37:48 Beto the cruz family is in the mix of the American Oligarchs that steal from the profits of the American peoples BLOOD SWEAT & TEARS EVEN GIVING THEIR CHILDREN TO DIE IN MILITARY.. US Oligarchs steal through theNYSE and all our resources (oil, gas etc.) So its not fair for Cruz
6187 2018-09-26 15:37:47 No, they accuse him of being present.  They accuse him of being in a line to participate.  Avenatti's carefully crafted affidavit is meant to delay.  It's their hail mary, but it's going to land incomplete.

6195 2018-09-26 15:36:51 So.... we should add MORE REALLY LARGE ONES LOADED WITH DILBIT? 

Your map makes the opposite point. There are already far too many oil barges and tankers in the Salish Sea.
6196 2018-09-26 15:36:40 for moisturizing try a rose hip oil blend, also for taking off make up itll work, i do that & hot water to stay clean, & an occasional face mask from kitchen items. the simpler my routine the less zits i get! i hope you find something that helps you soon!!!
6197 2018-09-26 15:36:38 One reason more to get rid of oil.
Without oilincome these terrirorism funding states will collaps.

6200 2018-09-26 15:36:26 I'm surprised there aren't huge wind farms out in Lake Michigan or on the plains. Seems like a huge missed opportunity! I know they're not to everyone's tastes but we're going to have to stop burning coal and oil eventually...

6205 2018-09-26 15:36:07 Or maybe expectation is meeting reality.
Typically hemp oil contains low levels of CBD- “less than 25 parts per million”- whilst CBD oil can be up to 15% CBD. Both oils hold a place in our daily health routines but it is important to remember they do have their differences.

6207 2018-09-26 15:36:06 other disagreements with Syria include  a national bank

blaming oil for airstrikes is diversionary and excuses responsibility

I think the US wars because it can
corporate claims on territory oil is secondary

If oil was a motive| another motive would be found
6208 2018-09-26 15:36:04 My thoughts too, I wonder if the  act should also apply to incorrect or misleading journalists who essentially "fire up" these people with their half-truths - I'm specifically thinking about drillordrop but there are others that should also be brought into line.

6258 2018-09-26 15:30:57 Is it weird that I enjoy sitting at the car dealership to get my oil changed? She said it may take 2 hours, girl that’s fine!They got every single coffee creamer flavor & I just used 3 different kinds. Plus they give free  & water bottles. #chillin

6268 2018-09-26 15:30:18 @jiffylube I took my car to get an oil change at Jiffy Lube, unfortunately they couldn't take care of me because the oil pan bolt wouldn't come out, I took it to the dealer and they said it was dented and the oil pan most likely will need replaced which is $400 dollars, any help?

6272 2018-09-26 15:30:11 i used to wash my face twice a day(morning & before going to bed) and now i only wash my face in the morning and personally i noticed a difference! i think i was over washing which was causing more oil production

6287 2018-09-26 15:28:40 Like Bevin and his gang in the UK, or Chamberlain on the other side of the "British aisle" (sorry, I needed to make a pun today, even a bad one--that kind of day), it was about the oil. Always about the oil.

6291 2018-09-26 15:28:30 Visionless leaders!!!

If we have had any amongst the various coup plotters that intervened in Nigeria's democracy, we won't be dependent on crude oil.

Nigeria was a developing country 30 yrs ago & currently ranks amongst the poorest in the world.

Our leaders are visionless
6292 2018-09-26 15:28:27 Anyone...

I walked in on the BBC airing his China comment, but did Trump make ANY comment about Russia relating to the deaths in Britain, continuing interference in our election system, or even their oil trading with N. Korea?

6303 2018-09-26 15:27:38 Nexus loves oil and they wanted that damn pipeline. Many in the Left media and other lefties at Standing Rock were mercenaries, informants, and infiltrators helping out the FBI, the local police and the oil company. There's a lot of fake Lefties.

6309 2018-09-26 15:26:44 It doesn't dummy. We import oil from Nigeria, Saudi et al. Shithole countries on the human right council.

6320 2018-09-26 15:25:45 And why wouldn't any "increase in the cost of doing business" PURPORTEDLY caused by the Iran Sanctions not be "absorbed in the Oil Companies RECORD PROFIT MARGINS?"

Funny, no "news" outlet in the Post Fairness Act era has ever even posed the question. 

Coincidence? 

Uh, no.
6321 2018-09-26 15:25:34 @Ritzcrackers the future is supposed to be green, but it looks black.. and it does not help that you support dirty palm oil.. the future of our children depends on large companies like yours..  stop misusing our natural world and start being the change you want to see!!!!

6325 2018-09-26 15:25:15 一度だけOilはやったことありますよ。自分は基本的にはチャートしかみないので、その時は75ドルから急降下する前のほぼ天井でショートしてました。が、よくわからずにすぐに利食ったらあれよあれよと60台ミドルまで落ちていきました(-_-;)結局商品であっても、通貨であっても握力不足です( ﾉД`)
6326 2018-09-26 15:25:06 Hemp oil is not to be confused with CBD oil... 
Typically hemp oil contains low levels of CBD “less than 25 parts per million”- whilst CBD oil can be up to 15% CBD. Both oils hold a place in our daily health routines but it is important to remember they do have their differences.
6327 2018-09-26 15:25:03 Yeah, not how it works. Venezuela isolated itself when it adopted socialism. Gov seized the oil companies, redistributed wealth, and now Maduro eats at SaltBae's restaurant while the rest of his country starves. 

PS. The article also bends over backwards to NOT mention socialism
6328 2018-09-26 15:25:00 Dear Sir
Don't expect any thing from the west wrt Cameroon. Self interest: they need to protect their oil deals. It is a Shame
6329 2018-09-26 15:24:51 The only downfall to the CBD oil I've been taking is it reminds me of lube. Like peppermint flavored lube lmfao so gross

6332 2018-09-26 15:24:23 The hot air that comes out of a yap like that. Imagine what comes out the other end. The high price of oil is because of OPEC. Even Trump is complaining. Probably will keep rising for awhile. Instead of India, maybe should've gone to middle east.
6333 2018-09-26 15:24:04 Ze germans giggled but we are the number 1 oil producer and natural gas exporter now so laugh now cry later morons
6334 2018-09-26 15:24:00 Yes, they do have oil. They also have millions of people dying of starvation and then being murdered by the Socialist regime when they protest, all while their president dines on entrees that cost more than your salary.
6335 2018-09-26 15:23:59 An example for olive oil is certain acids that define what soil it was grown in, providing a fairly accurate location for where the olives were grown, that can be measured with sensors. DNA sampling tamper proof sensors  are no sci-fi.
6336 2018-09-26 15:23:56 Read on Facebook that shaving ur legs with olive oil makes you well smooth so I’m about to try it but I kinda cba cause u already know I’m gonna slip and break my neck

6347 2018-09-26 15:22:40 In 2015, the Refugio Oil Spill in Santa Barbara raised questions about @PHMSA_DOT's ability to properly enforce oversight of critical pipeline safety laws. 7 years after the Pipeline Safety Act was enacted, rules requiring automatic shutoff valves still aren't enforced.
6348 2018-09-26 15:22:31 Looks like a load of drilling pipe for a foreign oil company to punch holes in our aquifer.
6349 2018-09-26 15:22:30 Libya, Syria and even Yemen. Yemen happens to be located on the peninsula of where the oil carriers pass and Saudi and US would rather destroy a country than to pay for passage.

6363 2018-09-26 15:21:07 I wonder whether OPEC countries wd take @POTUS warning seriously & voluntarily maintain price discipline or they wl force d President 2 take punitive action?

6365 2018-09-26 15:20:58 The IPCC money is granted in order to implement a hugh non needed CO2- tax for the globalist to play around with.
The carbon industry need not bother, because they will sell their products anyway. No CO2-tax will stop production. We just can't be without coal, oil an gas.

6375 2018-09-26 15:19:55 I hope Iran will show  its good will and sell its oil well below the present absurdly high market price .
6376 2018-09-26 15:19:54 If oil prices go on an extended tear, there'll be another massive shift away from oil in all its markets. But as you say it depends on the extent of the rise and for how long.
6377 2018-09-26 15:19:41 We didn't have North Sea oil revenues then.

6388 2018-09-26 15:18:56 Guys, I would never call myself a foodie, but I've discovered something that has rocked my food world.
Roasted radishes!
Cut them into chunks, toss them in olive oil and salt and pepper, and roast on a grill or in oven.
They are the best!!!
6389 2018-09-26 15:18:49 I eat 2+ large ones a week, but I just cut them into 1-2" cubes, heat a huge pan on high, coat em in olive oil and my favorite cajun seasoning and cook till they have a bit of char on them.  almost a meaty taste.  l-o-v-e them!!

6394 2018-09-26 15:18:17 Not crude, but still valuable oil
6395 2018-09-26 15:18:13 Na Engine oil.. 
6396 2018-09-26 15:18:13 Iran should be getting their soon. HAHA

Ever wonder of the 20,000 Jew's who live in peace inside Iran, if any of them live near any Atomic Reactors the US will target for Israel?

6397 2018-09-26 15:18:09 Seen in a BBC news article...

6404 2018-09-26 15:17:13 No it doesn't. Oil is a bonus not a basis.
6405 2018-09-26 15:17:11 Only 200 miles over for an oil change. I’m taking a minute to say I’m GETTING AN OIL CHANGE before it gets to 3000 over. Ayeeee slow clap
6406 2018-09-26 15:17:03 hydration + moisturizing is key  i used to think i was too oily for products like this but turns out i was too dry and therefore producing too much oil. sometimes what u think u don’t need is actually the ticket
6407 2018-09-26 15:16:58 How French wanting to gets its hands on Iranian oil and gas  they deal with Satan oh I forgot UN sanctions and French companies doing sanctions busting with Iraq and saddam
6408 2018-09-26 15:16:54 In what world is an oil change $85
6409 2018-09-26 15:16:41 Yep FANG Trump has presided over the GREATEST NASDAQ run up in history! He not only plays Wack-A-Mole with EVERY OTHER SECTOR (Oil/Biotech/Materials(infrastructure) ALL WHILE 1)Excluding Apple from tariffs), 2)NOT addressing the Obvious GOOGLE/Amazon Monopolies!
6410 2018-09-26 15:16:18 Got it. Poorest country, focus on country, in the world that produces oil and gas?
6411 2018-09-26 15:16:14 The whole palm oil for biofuels project has been a total failure. So many plants went out of business
6412 2018-09-26 15:16:09 I’m a year w/o a cigarette , I only use all natural products (aloe, vitamin E, Shea butter, tea tree oil, & coconut oil to b exact) &&&&& I follow my macros with a 16 hr fasting regimen 
6413 2018-09-26 15:16:04 It's because they spend long dark winters sitting writing novels, then use their oil money to fund translation of it!

6417 2018-09-26 15:15:15 This has a major effect on the wellbeing of the African countries’ economic prosperity, removing their governments from any economic sovereignty, due to the loss of control over the oil.

6430 2018-09-26 15:14:02 Trying to get my oil changed... Gawd they are slow.
6431 2018-09-26 15:14:01 Thambi - major issues started only after use for biofuel - when it was for cooking oil it wasn't this bad
6432 2018-09-26 15:13:56 R u mad ? Didn't u just saw how they applied water,soap , shampoo,oil , chilly powder. These r not some materials but many materials to cause u pain. Remember the condition of shrishty ,kV and dipika. They were not letting them breath. Its tit fr tat.
6433 2018-09-26 15:13:49 having a car is nice until it’s time for inspection and an oil change 
6434 2018-09-26 15:13:46 Roger Stone’s political strategy reminds me of P.T. Barnum. The only difference being the use of the word “chump” versus “sucker.” Amazing how many naively believe the @realDonaldTrump snake oil sales pitch. Check out the Netflix documentary on Stone. Dirty tricks on steroids. 
6435 2018-09-26 15:13:45 @realDonaldTrump is at it again blaming #China for messing with polls for the #Midterms2018! #Trumpanzee is also trying to get more countries to stand with him again Iran! If Oran is stopped from exporting oil, expect major price increases in fuel!

6436 2018-09-26 15:13:36 Okay WHY is it so tricky to find a vegan cereal?? Even Kellogg’s corn flakes are made with sheep’s wool oil??? That’s weird and gross. Come on. How hard is it to make corn flakes with corn

6439 2018-09-26 15:13:02 Jokes aside it’s the damn deep frying that’s so prevalent in Indian food that leads to a high demand for palm oil based cooking oils. Stop eating fried foods!

6441 2018-09-26 15:12:51 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi

6446 2018-09-26 15:12:24 Petrol price war sparked after supermarkets crash prices by 2p a litre and more retailers could follow. Cutting a price for petrol that is massively overcharged in the first place is not a price war. A price war is undercutting a true value price. Oil companies making a killing

6450 2018-09-26 15:11:55 Good finance discussion in @NYClimate (investors, companies, NGOs). My take:  in 2007 I left IB to help on US co2 market...not here...as w/oil exec using $40/ton by ‘05 after Kyoto.  SO: 1) don’t assume rational policy, 2) mitigation/NCS w/ROI<10% can still be EVA+ w/good metrics
6451 2018-09-26 15:11:53 The US wants venezuela's oil!
6452 2018-09-26 15:11:50 Interesting.  So Trump would have preferred that they push through Kavanaugh weeks ago.  I wonder if that's because he knew if someone started digging, they'd hit oil?  Or in this case, swamp gas.
6453 2018-09-26 15:11:42 That's our Southwest Style with chickpeas (sometimes I use blackbeans or a combo), corn, bell pepper, sweet onions, cucumber,  tomatoes, cilantro & house dressing made with cilantro oil, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, & apple cider vinegar.See our Instagram for other salads
6454 2018-09-26 15:11:41 Exactly! Ori, black soap and coconut oil. These things, my earliest memory of them was village cos I saw them there only. But look at us now!
6455 2018-09-26 15:11:39 baby oil with you have you feeling smooovee
6456 2018-09-26 15:11:34 They are because of two reasons. 1. Soybean oil is extracted to create flavorings, tofu, etc and 2. Soybeans are grown to feed cattle and other livestock. So with out cheap soy to feed livestock with alot more farmers and dairy producers would be out of business.
6457 2018-09-26 15:11:28 The Butterfly Effect: getting to watch a man throw a hot dog at 90 mph at a gas station sign all because we paid off the CIA to get rid of some modernist architecture because the idea of oil being more expensive was funny. And we were right. #NationalPancakeDay

6481 2018-09-26 15:09:29 Another sick rant from a snake oil salesman.
6482 2018-09-26 15:09:16 Might be. But the military seam schizophrenic towards oil. It needs to last forever while being scarce enough to keep nations under control. Green energy is a win win win win situation, except for the military
6483 2018-09-26 15:09:12 oil pastels are so annoying whoever invented them is garbage
6484 2018-09-26 15:09:12 CBD Oil also works well!!
6485 2018-09-26 15:09:12 This is because the majority of the people who they claim to represent during elections no longer are blind and have stopped donating to them. So they rely on the oil, pharma & military complex to buck them up.
Money still pours into candidates who back the people, not 1%.

6541 2018-09-26 15:04:28 All big money is tainted though not just ours. The UK government sell weapons to these middle east regimes, Utd have sponsorship with Gulf Oil. The Glaziers were in business with George Bush. You can't have it both ways.

6551 2018-09-26 15:03:27 After a tepid response to the ‘free interpretive dance with every oil change’ promotion, Jiffy-Lube fired the entire marketing department.

The new hires cooked up a ‘poke in the eye with every tire rotation’ deal that had customers lined up around the block. #vss365
6552 2018-09-26 15:03:22 No. "We" are fulfilling agreements with the Arab League to allow muslims to colonize the West in order to get oil. Also fulfilling the globalist (EU/UN) agenda to dissolve the nations and establish a sort of new European/global identity. About 3% are real refugees.
6553 2018-09-26 15:03:22 2007 June - Two leading US oil companies, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhilips, refuse to hand over majority control of their operations in the Orinoco Belt to the Venezuelan government, which then expropriates them.

6580 2018-09-26 15:01:19 1998 - Hugo Chavez elected president amid disenchantment with established parties, launches 'Bolivarian Revolution' that brings in new constitution, socialist and populist economic and social policies funded by high oil prices, and increasingly vocal anti-US foreign policy.

6586 2018-09-26 15:01:00 Stephen Brimstone asked by counsel to #RHI Inquiry when he was considering replacing his old biomass boiler in 2014, if there had not been attractive payments linked to scheme would he have returned his heating system to oil... Mr Brimstone says, "I wish I did."
6587 2018-09-26 15:00:52 What was the price of crude oil when your boss was in power?

6609 2018-09-26 14:58:37 It also might be all the people in the coal and Oil & gas industries who be made redundant because of his zero carbon emissions policy and I suspect that that might be far greater than 400,000
6610 2018-09-26 14:58:36 Try visiting the Countries we destroyed for oil and money. Thos are the Countries trying to get here. Not developed Countries with a batter standard of living and better system.

What a simple take. Youre smarter than this

6649 2018-09-26 14:53:46 Cut off Wilmar, you have been buying dirty palm oil from them for years. Shame on you.
6650 2018-09-26 14:53:41 Think about the USA backing out of the deal with Iran and re-establishing sanctions: When Iran can't ship oil global supply decreases. This allows oil-producing countries to raise prices (Currently $800/BBl). This benefits OPEC (Saudi) and Russia. Interesting coincidence.

6667 2018-09-26 14:52:14 You can be both anti-Trump and anti-democrat. I don’t understand why people feel the need to choose. If someone offered you to drink brake fluid or motor oil would you equally feel compelled to choose?

6669 2018-09-26 14:52:10 Would be interesting. If there's nothing stopping them from not providing them -- or saying they'll do them only if you also buy an oil change or whatever -- the fact that everyone provides, no one limits, and some do coupons speaks volumes to me.
6670 2018-09-26 14:52:08 Maybe Diesel is close to heating oil, so the demand for that rises at this time of year.  I did hear once that winter diesel costs more to make as it has anti-waxing stuff in it, don't know how true that is though.

6683 2018-09-26 14:51:24 Water, shampoo, conditioner, and a hot oil treatment.

6686 2018-09-26 14:51:09 @The view Why is it so many Americans turn a blind eye 2 the terrorism OUR own country has perpetrated?

Blind eye 2 terrorism we R currently perpetrating?

OUR country has a history of terrorism by backing evil 2 overthrow governments 4 the benefit of mjr corps. Big oil is 1
6687 2018-09-26 14:51:05 thought EU was gonna ignore Trumps ban on Iranian oil imports, as were everyone else cept the USA? they are all still going along with the Nuc deal Obama negociated, point is, demand for Iran oil has not diminished as U suggest...
6688 2018-09-26 14:51:04 That’s a great point, they exceeded expectation. But with oil being restricted until the next pipeline, which will be years away, we can count on nominal growth. 

I’m not saying balanced budget, I’m saying we can’t do 9 billion in deficit. But can we get to 5 billion?
6689 2018-09-26 14:51:00 I get it bad in my feet when it’s very cold or very hot. Not nice at all. Might give the fish oil a go. Good luck.

6700 2018-09-26 14:49:40 What is wrong with these sinister DC naysayers? They pretend they just found out what NK wants: recognition and peace, not just oil and power plant.

AFAIK only the green party has any plan to promote domestic oil refining.
6707 2018-09-26 14:48:54 What are you disagreeing with?  The fact that the US and Russia both had plans to build competing pipelines to provide oil to Europe has been corroborated on multiple occasions including diagrams.

6733 2018-09-26 14:46:37 I agree. I also own Enbridge shares which currently pays a 6% dividend and Ford just announced that he is bringing natural gas to Northern Ontario. If we want population growth than we will still need oil and gas. Canadas forest's absorb 4 times the CO2 we omit.

6754 2018-09-26 14:45:12 If you can't run oil tankers down the coast, why should they be able to run any other ships down the BC coast?  Why is it okay to import jet fuel?  Should BC shut down all shipping ports to eliminate the chance of any type of spill?
6755 2018-09-26 14:45:07 It was underfunded and old. The updating of all infrastructure needed doing in the 80's with North sea oil money...it stagnated and the oil money disappeared.

I believe she is a snake oil saleswoman. And, for the record, I believe being smart is not irrelevant to this discussion.

6982 2018-09-26 14:27:52 I find dissolving an anchovy in the oil as it heats gives it that little extra oomph in the flavour department.
6983 2018-09-26 14:27:50 @nitin_gadkari You are doing a great job,but I think you should also ask oil refineries to supply BS6 fuel to other cities instead of Hi speed petrol & diesel. Now car manufacturers should also slowly start selling BS6 cars as they export them.Why to wait until deadline of  2020.

I could be wrong.
6989 2018-09-26 14:27:21 Trump's speech in #UNGA he spoke about good relationships USA care about Syria but USA moved embassy to Jerusalem, then USA sanctions against Iran but USA also demand for lower oil pricing.

Sounds promising. Let's make sure we also study the data
6997 2018-09-26 14:26:19 If higher oil prices stick around for long enough, probably. But I thought we renewables backers were supposed to be overjoyed that #PV and #wind were now the "cheapest" source of power at pretty much "any" #oil price, so the trend was that way anyways.

7005 2018-09-26 14:25:18 Essential oils to perfume: The whole point of a perfume is for the body's natural heat and chemistry to mix with external scents and waft off of you. The point is NOT oil absorption although some of that will happen. Hence the difference in percentage from topical use to perfume

7018 2018-09-26 14:24:37 I have a question for Civil Service prelims aspirants of May - June 2019, which Indian oil refiner does not accept Indian rupee for finished products sold to domestic retailer? Your correct answer may even land u in the Land of Long Imprisonment!
7019 2018-09-26 14:24:34 He says we will have zero carbon emissions so that means all jobs in the coal industry and oil & gas industry will go. I suspect that might be more than 400,000
7020 2018-09-26 14:24:26 Je suis athée! So I don’t think either Allah, Jesus, Vishnu, etc... can or will do anything! Most conflicts comes from religions and natural ressources like Oil!
7021 2018-09-26 14:24:23 The bigger question would be whether he is smart enough to understand that he cannot block the sales of Iranian oil AND have at the same time low oil prices ! But maybe he did not show up in Economics 101, too busy chasing women no doubt  though it's unlikely he kept his agenda

7046 2018-09-26 14:21:28 essential oil tip 5: If you'd like to use an essential oil as a scent DILUTE IT FIRST! Not only will the scent last longer if you do, you won't be shocking your body so much.

7047 2018-09-26 14:21:19 Oil data coming out at 10:30 (9 more min)... usually these cause spikes and drops in either $UWT $DWT
7048 2018-09-26 14:21:18 However, we need the oil companies to get on board with synthetic fuels. It's in their interest. Best green action they could take is building&operating pilot plants to produce some of their product from re-cycled CO2. If they'll do this with nuclear heat, progress is being made.

7056 2018-09-26 14:20:35 Depends on the oil. Pure CBD oil won’t give you a high. For it to be effective it’s possible that you’ll need a CBD oil with some THC in it. Again a small amount won’t affect you but the THC is the part that is illegal. There are cannabis clubs now that will give you more info

7229 2018-09-26 14:06:46 not when the people conducting the debate are so closely related to the people who benefit from oil and gas production.

7232 2018-09-26 14:06:32 It must always stick except your using a non stick pot, the difference is with oil, you get a less sticky and more fluffy Semo.  I just add little to the water I want to pour my paste in
7233 2018-09-26 14:06:27 Trying to clean up vegetable oil off the floor is a pain in the ass
7234 2018-09-26 14:06:26 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
7235 2018-09-26 14:06:24 .@NRDC I love clean coal. Love clean oil. And look. You can't even see methane. So it's really really Clean. The environment is Overrated. It's like my Huge bucket of KFC - you throw it away when you're done. Then, you just get another one!

7237 2018-09-26 14:05:45 i cut out dairy/red meats, take different vitamins, & only wash my face once a day. i use thayers alcohol free toner and then use first aid beauty water cream as a moisturizer so i don’t add more oil to my already oily face! i also take a probiotic which has helped tremendously!
7238 2018-09-26 14:05:40 They have been move oil out of that terminal for OVER 60 years. I would be more concerned with the open pile of coal sitting near the tsawwassen docks. Just blows right into the strait.
7239 2018-09-26 14:05:33 Against everybody on the ground with the intend to commit genocide to take on very territories + resources like oil in the ground!!! So that degree cousin of wickedness in our species we need to learn to get under control...
7240 2018-09-26 14:05:28 Who told him palm oil is the cure? Dude don go put hand for somewhere. Nne run for your life that's if you are still alive.

7243 2018-09-26 14:05:23 Wow I was dying of allergies a few days ago. I truly believe in crystal and oil healing. We needed this energy shift though.
7244 2018-09-26 14:05:20 I would never ever recommend anyone to make a purchase with @SavannahToyota1 - my calls go unanswered, no follow through on commitments, unbelievably long response time even when you speak to a Manager. The only thing done well there is an oil change... #worstcustomerservice
7245 2018-09-26 14:05:03 NDP anti oil? Not sure I agree with that. But everyone is entitled to their opinions.

7252 2018-09-26 14:04:47 It’s hard to believe anyone when they use the snake oil salesman, @MichaelAvenatti as an attorney.  Where is that coward anyway?  I think he got punked by a 4Chan user.  That’s rough, man.  Sorry but fuck Avenatti and all the bullshit he brings with him.

7256 2018-09-26 14:04:37 In the worldwide oil industry, an oil barrel is defined as 42 US gallons, which is about159 litres or 35 imperial gallons.
7257 2018-09-26 14:04:32 @FredAndersonKia  my wife just was taken advantage of at the service counter. Auto under warranty + extended warranty + family plan. Went for oil change and was told about a recall and then pushed to add $200 additional unwarranted work. Not family friendly

7261 2018-09-26 14:03:45 Arguably, oil is the one commodity that is more than a simple commodity. . .

7263 2018-09-26 14:03:42 Oil consists of 78% of imports so increasing import duty on 15-20 small goods will not reduce imports even by 1%.
7264 2018-09-26 14:03:39 Fake news.  CA gets vast % of its energy from oil, gas, coal, and nuclear... less than 1 % from wind and solar.

7273 2018-09-26 14:02:43 @LisaDaftari Would you tackle this request: How many Americans see what is being done by other Americans to prevent more oil, than present, being shipped to the US.  I ask because the Tides Foundation is funding efforts to prevent pipelines from being built in Canada
7274 2018-09-26 14:02:41 I used to have a friend like that. She can drink red oil as if it’s water. 

Her anger eh. No be here.
7275 2018-09-26 14:02:37 I appreciate greatly you saying this.  There are a lot of us here in America deeply disgusted and embarrassed that our fellow citizens fell hook line and sinker for this snake oil salesman and his enablers.

7315 2018-09-26 13:58:10 Do you use CBD oil?

Look at your ingredients: Your CBD oil should not have any of these fillers (MCT oil/coconut oil, vegetable oil, glycerin, water, sunflower seed oil, emu oil, etc.)

If your bottle says Hemp Oil as the only ingredient... that is NOT CBD oil!!

7364 2018-09-26 13:54:18 U.S. President Donald Trump should stop interfering in the Middle East if he wants the price of oil to stop rising, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying on Wednesday
7365 2018-09-26 13:54:15 My license has been expired for a whole month & i didn’t even know  so i renewed it online & now Brax & i are gonna go get an oil change, then I’m deep cleaning! What a successful day LOL
7366 2018-09-26 13:54:05 Iz bacon soup just oil? Or are they cans filled with ink?
7367 2018-09-26 13:54:04 You're on a coconut oil kick today.
7368 2018-09-26 13:54:03 Last night I had salmon topped with lemon juice, olive oil and capers with a side of fries! It was delicious!!! 
7369 2018-09-26 13:54:02 Iranian oil exports are declining ahead of a second round of U.S. sanctions to be imposed on Nov. 4 and Iran's economy is likely to contract 3 percent this year and 4 percent in 2019

7372 2018-09-26 13:53:54 L’Arabie Saoudite le fait car elle n’a pas la capacité d’augmenter sa production, ou bien car elle a besoin de sous pour son économie ?
7373 2018-09-26 13:53:48 This goes back to the discussion about Corporate Social Responsibility and the UN Global Compact; if Shell dumps oil in the Niger delta, and builds a school there, that doesn't make the company acceptable imo. No matter how good the school is.
7374 2018-09-26 13:53:46 I wonder how many Ltrs are in a barrel of oil?
7375 2018-09-26 13:53:44 oil change then heading to class.
7376 2018-09-26 13:53:42 Can someone direct me to Beth Wilkinson resume

This is what ppl are tweeting. Attorney for: 

Big tobacco. 
Big oil. 
Pedophiles

If this is true she sounds horrendous and I trust her not.

7377 2018-09-26 13:53:37 You throwing the whole southern region under the bus justify what?
7378 2018-09-26 13:53:34 Use this money for UPA pending oil bonds and reduce the petrol prices to ₹65 ... Thanks in advance ...
7379 2018-09-26 13:53:30 Left the special oil seeping overnight accidentally on purpose. 
It's green like absinthe and tastes like grass and I betcha it'll knock me on my butt. 
Which is the goal. 
7380 2018-09-26 13:53:29 I learned a trick... fry them, like literally fry them in coconut oil, then add real salted butter! But I prefer beef bacon. I know you didn’t ask... ok let me shut up now... 

Oh and good morning! 
7381 2018-09-26 13:53:29 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.

Can't our salary be proportional to the rising #oil & #gas prices ?? #Petrol @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi

#ActivistArrests
Data leaks become oil
#Deaths by Aadhaar glitches

Talk about those
7384 2018-09-26 13:53:19 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now.
7385 2018-09-26 13:53:03 Can a distant relative or someone from high school sell me an essential oil that'll go to work and do my job for me?
7386 2018-09-26 13:53:02 なるほど...
お腹あたためて大人しくしとく...
イブも買う...教えてくれてありがとー
7387 2018-09-26 13:52:57 Not trolling, just trying to expose frauds like you so that honest people looking for help aren't fooled by your lies.

When frauds like you stop peddling your snake oil, I'll go away.
7388 2018-09-26 13:52:57 Vegetable oil is poison don't use it
7389 2018-09-26 13:52:48 Or course you don’t see it. Your white privilege doesn’t allow you to. Like most white people, you feel entitled to rule the world without concern for the impact it has on people elsewhere.

Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. We know what this is REALLY about.
7390 2018-09-26 13:52:41 Gotta get an oil change and new tire 
7391 2018-09-26 13:52:39 Looking for Oil in all the Wrong Places.
7392 2018-09-26 13:52:33 #MarkOfImpact In 2012, David Mark save the nation from the catastrophic oil subsidy riots. It was also Mark and his colleagues who resolved the rift between the government and (ASUU) and their Polytechnics counterparts to return to classes after one year of industrial dispute
7393 2018-09-26 13:52:23 まゆちゃんの呼び方が安定しない
7394 2018-09-26 13:52:17 It should be illegal  for provinces to buy foreign oil.
7395 2018-09-26 13:52:08 Use it for oil bond payment and decide the petrol prices to Rs.60 per litre.
We know you get petrol for free from our tax paid money but it hurts us a lot ...
7396 2018-09-26 13:52:05 ままゆさん欲しいけど石貯めたいので我慢

7398 2018-09-26 13:52:01 tea tree oil pls be good to me :))
7399 2018-09-26 13:51:59 Does that mean you support big oil, drilling, and habitat destruction? Fur is a green, managable, renewable resource. There are over 50 oil byproducts that make no longer living in a era of fur trapping possible. Support the fur trade not big oil!
7400 2018-09-26 13:51:54 ดีออกกก 
7401 2018-09-26 13:51:51 Damn I wanna know if Antonio snuck over there and turned the fryer on with no oil

7403 2018-09-26 13:51:49 Given the events of this past week, it wouldn’t surprise me to see Judge Kavanaugh slap someone with a glove and demand satisfaction. Pistols on the National Mall at dawn ought to do it.

7406 2018-09-26 13:51:42 Please stop buying palm oil from Wilmar - they have dirty palm oil based on destruction of Indonesian rainforest.  Thank you for caring about the future.

7409 2018-09-26 13:51:09 Longest oil change of my life, it's done now. Just let me pay you so I can go home.
7410 2018-09-26 13:51:06 I’m not white and can easily see that this is and has always been about Venezuelan oil reserves. People are starving in the United States and around the world right now.  Why Venezuela?  Largest oil reserves in the world.
7411 2018-09-26 13:51:00 Munji
7412 2018-09-26 13:50:54 I had this problem before I started using it and I’m not even using a pure oil like it’s in a hair oil treatment bottle not just straight tea tree but maybe  I’m just gonna get a medicated shampoo or smthn and see if that works better

7429 2018-09-26 13:49:08 Not necessarily, data leaks are made for that purpose, data is oil
7430 2018-09-26 13:48:59 You could do "no protein" in this system by just adding sugar and oil or grease.
7431 2018-09-26 13:48:51 Pepsi profits from dirty palm oil. Unless CEO @IndraNooyi takes responsibility and ends @PepsiCo’s business deal with #palmoil offender @Indofood, Pepsi will continue to prop up the destruction of Indonesia’s #rainforests and #orangutans

7440 2018-09-26 13:47:36 Well, krn udah banyak baca tadi hehe maka ak memilih product2 #skincareroutine aku. Yg pertama adalah cleansing oil.
7441 2018-09-26 13:47:20 The Bushes and Chaney’s plus others was big in the oil fields,just like The Clintons they are all hungry for power,control. Greed controls their actions. They don’t care about anyone .They will Used you up and then dispose of you. They have sold their Souls to Satan.
7442 2018-09-26 13:47:16 only a break of 105.51 $BMO on a closing basis would warn of a #technical near-term change in #trend-#banks #markets #stockmarkets $TD $RY #centralbanks #NAFTA $TSX.CA #charts #oil #housing #BOC #Poloz #Trudeau
7443 2018-09-26 13:47:04 you may be using products that are too harsh on your skin or dry it out too much. this leads to the over production of oil as your glands try and over compensate for what the products took away.
7444 2018-09-26 13:47:01 You’ve never been a conservative. You’re a snake oil salesman like your father and milking whatever you can for $$ and power.
7445 2018-09-26 13:46:59 i need to bathe the fleas off my cats does anyone know where to get CDB oil so i dont get torn the fuck up by their claws and teeth lol

7448 2018-09-26 13:46:40 Trump is going to make nice with Venezuela to get it's oil flowing.  This is primarily to screw OPEC over for ignoring his demand to lower prices.
7449 2018-09-26 13:46:37 I wonder how this number compares to 2013 when oil price was in the same ballpark? #blindleadingblind #bebetter
7450 2018-09-26 13:46:34 He full of shit Venezuelans he doesnt wanna help Venezuela any more then Syrians when they get attacked with chemical weapons.  Is all a show to him. The only thing he wants to help himself is getting rid of everyone and taking over the oil fields.

7455 2018-09-26 13:45:49 Oman crude skyrocketed to a high of $88.96 since the 2015 plunge. It’s ridiculous how oil price forecasts are still a thing! They almost never get it right #Oman #WTI

7460 2018-09-26 13:45:30 I want to bring this up again. The word self-service to me is not service. My opinion. I remember pulling up to my gas station and they filled my car with gas, washed my windshield, check air pressure, and check my oil. All for the price of a gallon of gasoline! Great Service!!
7461 2018-09-26 13:45:16 He full of shit Venezuelans he doesnt wanna help Venezuela any more then Syrians when they get attacked with chemical weapons.  Is all a show to him. The only thing he wants to help himself is getting rid of everyone and taking over the oil fields.

7465 2018-09-26 13:44:50 Just read Antifa's threats have influenced the medical profession. They will now provide meds to children for sex alteration. What happened to Do No Harm?
America in grave trouble, DNA identity cannot be changed but man has lit a fire to truth once again. Snake oil selling!
7466 2018-09-26 13:44:33 There is one simple cost-effective solution to all of that. But he is paid to demonize it with the word SOCIALISM. I would not refer to the man as "thoughtful" when he is paid to be a snake oil salesman. Heartless & Manipulative come to mind in my years of following him.
7467 2018-09-26 13:44:32 That’s just tech tho. There’s more to the country in fashion, oil & gas, semiconductor, retail etc etc
7468 2018-09-26 13:44:25 Buys coming in at 5.41/5.42. Not long before ticks up again. Oil above $80. Stays like that and we could hedge a price which would help a young company like ours massively #UOG
7469 2018-09-26 13:44:20 I use Total engine oil for many years now. My friends are now advising me to switch to another one because Total is not as good as it used to be because it gets dark after few days.
7470 2018-09-26 13:44:04 “Don’t you dare come into this house in those clothes! You strip down there and I’ll put them in the wash tub to soak.”  Milly yell was the loudest sound Rebecca had heard her mom make since she'd been home.  “Dear Lord did you bath in that oil?”  Milly fumed. #1linewed

7474 2018-09-26 13:43:59 * His government constructed Victoria Island/Epe Road and thereby creating an ‘oil rig’ for Lagos State.

* His government established Asphalt Plant for the Department of Public Works.

7478 2018-09-26 13:43:39 I remember seeing you first time in the Metropole in Cardiff.
What you said about transforming Britain with green technology inspired me and it's so needed.
Looking forwards to you eradicating our dependence on oil and gas.
We'll be free again and a World leader- Go JC :)

7485 2018-09-26 13:43:02 Global Detox is going to be Epic, once oil companies and money systems are replaced by a resource based economy, rapid technology growth with the outcome focus being health, sustainability, resource economy.

7488 2018-09-26 13:42:53 Mining oil and alluvial diamonds is different. Oil requires heavy investment and am sure we will benefit. No one will loot the oil as compared to the alluvial diamonds which could be picked on the ground and didn’t require much investment.
7489 2018-09-26 13:42:47 There's probably an oil painting somewhere of Mozart's harpsichord as a thirsty tiddy girl
7490 2018-09-26 13:42:33 That was so much worse than my first car.  I only had to add oil twice a week, and water to radiator regularly.  Were you the guy telling me to get a horse?
7491 2018-09-26 13:42:32 Gurl, I relate to this. That happens to me with onion and oil always.
7492 2018-09-26 13:42:25 Zinke’s ideas to fund parks will be to open them to oil, logging and gas companies. Zero confidence he’ll handle this in an ethical or environmentally sound way.
7493 2018-09-26 13:42:24 Crude oil may touch $100/bbl in coming time. Dear @realDonaldTrump if you want to cut Iran off from the market then you must suggest an alternate !! Imposition is worst if one cannot provide other options. Wanna denuclearise Iran ? Do something else.
7494 2018-09-26 13:42:18 Just wanna slap oil on that body and get to rubbing you down
7495 2018-09-26 13:42:04 We import over $300 BILLION from Canada yearly. I assume you mistyped “crude oil and natural gas” because they are our largest supplier of both. 
Fox News lies.

7497 2018-09-26 13:41:55 Hey snake oil president collusion is the BIGGEST CON GAME!!!
7498 2018-09-26 13:41:55 We will be fine as long as 60% of our economy doesn’t depend on the oil price like that of Venezuela.
7499 2018-09-26 13:41:49 The way the price of crude oil is going up, they’ll increase fuel prices again.

7501 2018-09-26 13:41:37 While I think Cruz is a scumbag snake oil salesman, this is wrong.  Vote the asshole out.  Confronting him in this manner makes him look sympathetic.  Rationalizing this behavior still doesn’t make it right and is another step off the path of democracy
7502 2018-09-26 13:41:36 I'm not going to allow some clown to get me really angry. If people like ourselves challenge these people & their ideas rationaly & expose the snake oil salesmen they support then we're on to a winner.
Thank you we consultanted experts rather than some nomark on the Internet

7504 2018-09-26 13:41:12 Hi there! Sadly not, we only recommend using Osmo on a fresh untreated/sanded surface. Reason behind this is because our product needs to penetrate into the timber and so with a pre-existing oil in the timber, our product will not fully work.

7526 2018-09-26 13:39:26 Drat; am in an office now with no control either. Report to estates every day it's too cold (ask@kcl.ac.uk) as their performance metric is closing service requests. If it persists, ask for an oil filled radiator; most women or folk from warmer countries in my dept have one.

7529 2018-09-26 13:39:09 Trump’s obsession with invading Venezuela is strange. I wonder if he’s being manipulated into it by GOP donors who want to get their hands on Venezuela’s oil.

7544 2018-09-26 13:38:04 @realDonaldTrump ...not only do the American people know that but yesterday at the UN the world showed, by their laughter, that they know your a con man or a snake oil salesman. And you didn't mean for that to be funny. You even said you didn't expect that reaction. Make...

7554 2018-09-26 13:37:22 The oil was too hot.
7555 2018-09-26 13:37:10 That speech was brilliant. He was perfectly right about sovereignty, oil reliance, ppl staying in their own countries to improve them, make them tolerable, only financing countries that support our interests.

7578 2018-09-26 13:34:57 Same thing also apply to crude consumption. Yeah in this decade and maybe next decade India oil demand will grow with the growing (not to be confused with developing) economy but can’t say the same thing for the 2040.

7594 2018-09-26 13:34:03 @realDonaldTrump the way to get the price of oil under control is have an investigation on price-fixing at the pump or the use of our own monopoly laws on the oil industry. Time to fix the problem. #NOPEC @FoxNews @CNBC

7598 2018-09-26 13:33:47 Some good news there , Labour suggesting Scotland should keep all of its oil - meeting Labours target early.

I jest of course , labours history on Scots oil is already out there, preventing it on the Clyde to keep Trident for English jobs, and stealing 6000 miles of seas.
7599 2018-09-26 13:33:41 Bc the rich want it all without the concern of having 2 care 4 ppl, the 1% wants all the minerals, oil/gas rights, right 2 place pipelines anywhere they way, all the waterway rights & waterfront properties in these countries & ppl that don’t die will b used as shave labor
7600 2018-09-26 13:33:35 @DavidBlairCBC reporting that oil shipments by rail reached an all time high. With demand for oil continuing to grow (fuel, plastics, etc.) increasing amounts will travel by much-less-safe and higher-GHG-emitting modes of rail & truck.

7602 2018-09-26 13:33:23 Hydrocortisone cream relieves the swelling a lot without the pink mess that calamine is. Besides calamine is more for the itching. Also, take ibuprofen it’ll treat the overall inflammation. 
I also use tea tree oil to keep the mosquitoes away. Mosquitoes in the south are no joke.
7603 2018-09-26 13:33:22 Oil companies will try their best for it not to like, but it will never happen with that attitude!

7606 2018-09-26 13:33:14 Germany is currently at 30% in using renewable energy. In 2022 it will not be dependent on oil anymore. The US will need Saudi Arabia for their energy in 2 to 3 years time.

The Philippines? We need the West PH Sea for oil but ooops Duterte gave it to China.
7607 2018-09-26 13:33:12 「やらされている」ものは自分の糧になっているか常に自分に問うて、その価値を見つけることでモチベーションに変えている。そのほかのものは「やりたい」ものだからやるだけ。思考は大事。だけど思考が目的化したらそれはもったいない。
7608 2018-09-26 13:33:11 I still think there's 2 Canadas:
One that still wants to get all that stupid oil
One that wants to electrify the fuck out of everything asap.

We'll never get along. I don't think this is "Québec" issues, it's bigger. This country has 2 incompatible mentalities within. 
7609 2018-09-26 13:33:05 Damn I missed the GMA thing fucking around getting an oil change. Someone point me in the direction of links
7610 2018-09-26 13:33:05 Take care of them = try to take their oil.
7611 2018-09-26 13:33:04 Can't rule out Trump sending in US Marines at this point.

Venezuela oil reserves are too valuable to allow mismanagement, especially since Iran Oil Sanctions begin in November.
7612 2018-09-26 13:33:00 Pathological liar draft dodger Donny the dicktator pretends to care about the Venezuelan people!
Yet he lies about the death toll of our own US citizens of Puerto Rico!
If Venezuelans showed up at the border he’d cage them!
Donny wants to steal their oil!
7613 2018-09-26 13:32:59 They don't have the slightest plan that is better. They simply want to delay transition from oil.

7614 2018-09-26 13:32:50 If by Joe public you mean #Scotland's People, I agree.

ONE Trillion in Oil Revenues taken by Westminster, we got Food Banks, poverty and the LOWEST pensions in the EU.
7615 2018-09-26 13:32:31 Pro tip: slather on @bananaboat oil whenever you see your man so he’ll subconsciously associate you with an exotic vacation and never leave you.

7630 2018-09-26 13:30:59 I think the main motivation for action would be to keep China from getting a hold of their oil
7631 2018-09-26 13:30:58 Still, it isn't 4 US to decide whether market 4 crude oil is "well-supplied". Long story. Furthermore, since Trump's stmt. @ UN made everyone curious about how Iran has misbehaved, public would be well-served if it heard facts about alleged misbehavior. I really want to know.
7632 2018-09-26 13:30:55 North Dakota, with the same or worse weather than NY has population increase. I think it might have everything to do with the gas and oil industry. Which our genius banned.
7633 2018-09-26 13:30:51 Thank you, mate. It's a lovely bird. Seen in main side garden, and again in the back quarter by the oil tanks, and two willow trees, and seen it fly through the evergreens in the garden next door being the shop.
7634 2018-09-26 13:30:50 @MichaelHartShow Yep, grape seed oil and avocado oil are great for cast iron cooking. Clean with salt. #Kavanaughandcornbread
7635 2018-09-26 13:30:39 This is infuriating to watch! Who even watches fake CNN anymore? They fucked me once good earlier this year on a fake oil story forcing me to liquidate some positions. And in this case of Kavanaugh apparently it's guilty until proven innocent. Like wtf?

7638 2018-09-26 13:30:27 The gouging of the system is to the tune of trillions by the wealthy. Oil company subsidies, the military industrial complex, tax havens. The greedy will try to convince to hold welfare people "accountable" while perpetrators of the banking collapse can walk away scot-free.
7639 2018-09-26 13:30:10 Hope you have enough blood?
Because the day there's no palm oil or you guys forgot to carry it along, you know the next alternative...

7642 2018-09-26 13:30:06 20 democrats on Capital hill stand to get Richer when USA starts rebuilding Syria like they did Iraq .         
USA pays for rebuilding but then a few rich democrats then own oil pipelines , electric services and Hotels / Resorts. This must stop because we pay for them to get rh

7648 2018-09-26 13:29:04 The United States for policy reasons restricts the flow of oil from Venezuela, Iran and Russia - then complains when the global price of oil goes up. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

7672 2018-09-26 13:27:09 In Canada  they exports even tar oil and the small populations of Canada don't consume much electricity anyways enough water for fully hydroelectricity and keep coal ,gas and  oil exchange to America for teslas cars go fully green love the green part of Canada   
7673 2018-09-26 13:27:05 @Ally They have one of the highest interest rates - zero fee, minimum balance checking. 24 hour service (and the wait is never more than a minute or so). Nicest employees! Plus (as far as I know) they dont fund anti-enviromental companies like big oil.
7674 2018-09-26 13:26:53 Politically naive 2 think any sides of the US Congress be interested in anything other than oil & business! Democracy 4 ppl is total nonesense as it's in Afghan, Egypt, Turkey, Saudis, N Korea, etc! Soon as US terms r agreed, any leaders be as good as Kim!

7677 2018-09-26 13:26:12 Do I have to be up this early for an oil change?
7678 2018-09-26 13:26:02 Today's word - Oleaginous :  adjective  1. rich in, covered with, or producing oil; oily.  2. exaggeratedly and distastefully complimentary; obsequious.  Reading the SandwellSkidder improves your vocabulary kidda!
7679 2018-09-26 13:25:58 Chippy sat on a whole g of oil last night and wasted the entire graham. I hate him. Literally.
7680 2018-09-26 13:25:57 Aren’t Soybeans legumes. So there lying about vegetable oil.
7681 2018-09-26 13:25:52 You can not pursue everyone Mr.President
You want a cheaper oil,,let the oil producing countries in the middle East that the USA and Allies destroyed stabilize likes of Libya,Iraq
7682 2018-09-26 13:25:50 I'm usually with you guys but I think you're off on this one! Supply chain isn't a tax & most industries don't have the same supply chain transparency of AdTech. How much of the $ you spend on gas goes to the oil well/refinery? Of your fried chicken $$ to the farmer?

@OGJOnline
7690 2018-09-26 13:25:04 Pls first do something about soaring oil prices, we trust BJP, they have been doing great work. Nothing seems to be happening in oil prices, if that continues ordinary people like us would respond you with our voat.
7691 2018-09-26 13:25:02 Reminds me that Biafrans didn't have enough charm to defend their oil fields down to the end.
7692 2018-09-26 13:24:49 Did you know that Pepsi has a palm oil problem? I want @IndraNooyi, the CEO of @PepsiCo to take responsibility for destroying #orangutans precious rainforest home and end her deals with dodgy #palmoil company @Indofood today!
7693 2018-09-26 13:24:46 As their 70 year old Super Giant fields that have had massive secondary water flooding for decades roll over you could see them lose 1.5 million b/d from those 6 fields that produce close to 90% of their oil.
7694 2018-09-26 13:24:38 Why do we have so much debt? We expect to compensate the money with oil money yet we might end up like Venezuela #JukwaaLaMadini2018
7695 2018-09-26 13:24:30 All true. But with population growth and economic development chances are that in the absence of a viable alternative energy source for transportation and construction, consumption of crude oil in India will most likely continue to increase.
7696 2018-09-26 13:24:30 Data is oil
7697 2018-09-26 13:24:22 I'm not defending oil companies here. I'm just pointing out that opposing 1631 doesn't tell you anything about whether they'd support a well-designed carbon tax.

7699 2018-09-26 13:24:05 Venezuela is still a capitalist country. Most of its economy is in private hands and the massive crisis it’s facing now is a result of the oil crash in 2014, sanctions, and hoarding by food producers
7700 2018-09-26 13:24:05 He is deadly serious of course, the world is crying out for more uses for tea tree oil and witch hazel. I for one will be a dedicated follower.
7701 2018-09-26 13:23:55 @xavierjayakumar thank you for speaking on medical marijuana. In the form of CBD oil it has THC (the component which gives the ‘high’) removed. When used for medical purposes, CBD oil does not make one high and is not addictive. Hence there is no issue on abuse of a drug
7702 2018-09-26 13:23:52 And with PMB now a president and will be till 2023 and Bashir Ahmad SA till he wish to resign what warrants all this bigotry ???
Is it justified?
7703 2018-09-26 13:23:51 My first time to attend the AT&T Business Summit or anything on this scale. What a production!  Makes my typical ICS cybersecurity conference, or even Oil & Gas trade shows, look like a meeting of the Little Rascals. #ATTBizSummit
7704 2018-09-26 13:23:38 Uh, no. It's a mess because of the US sanctions and all the CIA coups we've got going on there because they wouldn't give us their oil. But you keep listening to Fox&Friends.

7708 2018-09-26 13:23:13 It's my opinion that if Americans were shown the greed and chicanery of oil companies, lawyers and judges, they would no longer stand idle.
7709 2018-09-26 13:23:10 Don’t forget the olive oil.

7715 2018-09-26 13:22:14 Let's break bs with facts

True cost of energy
How far can you go in a car with 10kWh of energy/electricity?

Petrol/diesel - include oil drilling, oil transport, refining, fuel transport, storage, pumping and losses. Include military conflict & cost to human health-air pollution
7716 2018-09-26 13:21:49 And so do the people of Venezuela yet the US buys hudreds of thousands of barrels of oil every week from Maduro. Yet no embargo!

He gave two messages, what about the second message? 
1- OPEC must increase production to lower prices
2- OPEC countries must look after their own interests! 
It cannot be about oil prices.  It is a foreign policy thing that fits perfectly with the trade wars

7786 2018-09-26 13:15:47 Thank you Dottie, I hope you are right. I took acrylic oil classes when I was 16 for like two weeks lol. But they interferred with my husbands baseball playing and he bitched so much about it that I just quit.  Now at 61.............
7787 2018-09-26 13:15:39 With sanctions or without it, there will be no change in our life. Ask 45% unemployed citizens who can easily testify it. It's a pointless to ask you since you've got into the habit of being sponger,but tell me how selling oil will benefit the people's of Iran.

7790 2018-09-26 13:15:21 @dpradhanbjp sir US sanctions will Bring our oil imports from Iran to Zero and we will be importing From US. This will lead to continuous rise in petrol price at the benefit of US. Why are we obeying US as if we are their slaves sir?

London Labour took one Trillion from Scotland's Oil Revenue and spent it on London Vanity Projects.

Instead of Getting 200,000 EACH.
we got Food Banks child poverty and the LOWEST pensions in the EU.

8041 2018-09-26 12:50:33 For a country riding on our environmental strengths, we don't see any environment related pledges by the two parties. How about tax free import and subsidies on hybrid vehicles. This can address our oil balance of trade issues as well as demonstrate our leadership on environment.
8042 2018-09-26 12:50:26 Le prix à la pompe va forcément augmenter (peak oil). Quand on augmente les taxes, l'État français gagne de l''argent. Quand on augmente le prix du baril, les pays producteurs gagnent de l'argent. À choisir, autant que ce soit l'État et qu'on incite au changement de pratique.

8055 2018-09-26 12:48:57 Let's talk of mining as an extra. Venezuela used oil as the crutch... Say no more...
8056 2018-09-26 12:48:56 Dear @IndraNooyi I heard about Pepsi’s palm oil problem and I really hope that you’ll cut ties with @Indofood in your final week as CEO. I love #orangutans and our #rainforests too. Don’t let them die for cheap #palmoil

8060 2018-09-26 12:47:51 I mix organic neem, hempseed & vitamin E oil together, in a jar or spray bottle. I may add some coconut oil in from time to time. I use this potion as my fall and winter body lotion. It helps a lot. Also, no dairy or anything with peanuts...Google neem oil for eczema.
8061 2018-09-26 12:47:48 an eagle eye view:
1- It is NOT about "oil prices".  It is about "foreign policy"
2- Trump has been saying the same thing for 30 years, even when prices were low.
3- It fits well with #TradeWars 
It is about a "better deal" rather than just "oil prices".

8109 2018-09-26 12:42:05 I expect China to withdraw forward physical oil market liquidity from the completely inflated Brent/WTI complex and transfer it to Shanghai. It was control of this complex which enabled Obama to jack up prices in 2009 as massive 'fund' futures positions flowed in.

8165 2018-09-26 12:36:54 It's a big shame that reflects on the quality of leadership we've had over the years.

The mentality of central resource sharing as promoted by the military has meant that no one has really put any thought into Nigeria's prosperity via diversified trade, as opposed to just oil.

8199 2018-09-26 12:32:46 You'd have to ask my wife about the oil usage. It's beyond my pay grade.

8275 2018-09-26 12:23:55 Thanks.... I really don’t like Marijuana at least consuming or smoking. However CBD oil does reduce the pain some. It brings down to tolerable level. Doesn’t do much for sharp pains or extreme pain but it’s effective. The cost however is quite high but it’s good product
8276 2018-09-26 12:23:41 made onions first, low heat, olive oil, and salt.

8281 2018-09-26 12:22:44 When you consider all the head winds oil has faced over the last 3 years this really is a remarkable performance. They will throw a bunch of stuff at oil now that doesn't move the needle except for a trader. Tweets, SPR threats, false Saudi promises, Shale lies etc.
8282 2018-09-26 12:22:26 Or send a load of gunboats to everyone else's ports to blockade OPEC oil, that'd surely send the right message and have prices down double quick. I think?
8283 2018-09-26 12:22:19 Iran is virtually self sufficient for food production isn't it? If so currency shouldn't matter too much for ordinary Iranians. All that oil is now worth 4x what is was in Jan in local currency. Just need to be able to sell it to someone...  Play ball with DT?

8290 2018-09-26 12:21:36 Mr. President, you must get up to speed regarding our domestic energy situation. I have been a consulting petroleum engineer for close to forty years. OPEC no longer is the key driver in the oil market, as the US domestic shale oil production continues to rise, as our exports.

8298 2018-09-26 12:20:55 Of course! Stop co2 and you stop cancer and a myriad of other climatological, geographical, socialogical, psycological and anatomical problems, a snake oil salesman told me so.
8299 2018-09-26 12:20:54 I understand that. For me, it is shameful and unacceptable, as is Houthi torture described in the article. As a matter of scale, the Saudi/US genocide/atrocities are more deplorable. I can’t really wrap my head around this war other than that it is blood for oil, as usual.
8300 2018-09-26 12:20:49 Also, I switched to a pretty basic cleanser like Cetaphil, use witch hazel as a toner, and for moisturizer I’ll use a rose hip oil. Fighting oil with oil! I hope this helps. I know the struggle :(

A capital call was announced, I didn't re-invest thank goodness, and then the well was capped. That was when hard times hit Texas.

8394 2018-09-26 12:11:21 You are correct about the role of the speculators. During the recession around 2008 the speculators had a big role in keeping prices high. My opinion at the time was they traded on the demand of the consumer. Congress didn't understand when they questioned the oil executives.

8459 2018-09-26 12:03:45 Wiping out rules that are meant to protect people from exploding oil trains is not even close to an "adult" thing to do.  It is a selfish, shortsighted, and irresponsibe thing to do, driven by nothing better than simple, transparent corporate greed and avarice.  Screw that.

8500 2018-09-26 11:59:23 He's somewhat correct though, we import 62% of our total energy in Germany.

Of which 40% is from Russia.

8589 2018-09-26 11:48:34 Do they? It's surely barely thirty years since "It's Scotland's oil" made clear that Scottish nationalism was about selfishness, and far from resenting receiving handouts what they resented was sharing the bounty of the North Sea?
8590 2018-09-26 11:48:33 But does it make sense to hire them to diversify the economy - the supposed Way Forward goal - if a big chunk of that is making the oil industry an even larger part of GDP than it is?  We can say "yes" but we need to talk about what diversify means, obviously.  5/X  #nlpoli

8597 2018-09-26 11:47:32 It’s one of the fastest growing, most diverse economies on earth. Not depending on oil like the Arab states is a huge plus. American aid happens to be guaranteed by MOA for many years. Nevertheless it’s a tiny part of Israel’s GDP and spent almost solely on US.

8603 2018-09-26 11:47:03 Of course Trump is responsible for the rise in oil prices. You'd have to be pretty stupid to not understand that reimplementing sanctions against Iran takes their oil out of the common market pushing up prices according to supply and demand.
8604 2018-09-26 11:46:58 I’m finally feeling better tho. Black (cumin) seed oil got everything up out of my lungs & sinuses
8605 2018-09-26 11:46:54 Starting my morning off right. UltraCell Full Spectrum Hemp CBD Oil and Ultra Edge!  It is going to be a great Wednesday
8606 2018-09-26 11:46:48 But if we just vanish the fifth largest oil producer from the market surely this won't affect global supply & demand. I mean.... its a long stretch to connect these dots right?

Oil paused in its steady upward climb and even the £ gained a little – the expected higher demand did not materialise.

8615 2018-09-26 11:46:13 Halo! Saya sendernya, jadi karena ampule ini berbahan aktif disarankan gak usah pakai serum dan gak perlu essence lagi terutama yang mengandung niacinamide. Cukup toner - ampule - face oil - moist
8616 2018-09-26 11:46:02 Iran, Venezuela and Russia are huge oil exporters. Trump wants to sell US’s oil with good price. Coincidence?
8617 2018-09-26 11:46:02 Gotta go to the dealership tomorrow for this oil change  shit bet not take all day
8618 2018-09-26 11:45:46 Probably because it is much easier to hide and consume additional drugs within e-cigarettes.  CBD oil for instance.
8619 2018-09-26 11:45:38 We choose them and they don't really care about us. Government should look for another souce of income. Like export, we haven't really invested in that, the oil in turkana, and we shouldn't be importing things like maize, sugar, farmers are complaining hawana market

8622 2018-09-26 11:44:50 Telling the world "socialism" and "communism" don't work - placing sanctions on countries who practice; nuclearize, nationalize oil. And these folk elected are loyal to this modern colonial imperialistic rhetoric.

8624 2018-09-26 11:44:36 That is an absurd situation in a country with all manner of mineral resources, especially gas & oil; make it a requrement by law to price, sell & settle all exports of national resources in Rials; create & lend Rials to those  who need it to buy these & other #Iranian resources ?

8676 2018-09-26 11:38:03 They showed my old oil which was way balck in color and i dont think  new oil gets that balck within 200 kms. that means they have removed my 1st service oil and insterted another bottled black oil. Plz check with service centre im not at all happy with the service.

8810 2018-09-26 11:18:16 Umahi has been fantastic in the quality of roads and flyovers he is building, Rochas and Ikpeazu are disasters.  I wonder how the guy does all these roads without 13% oil derivation which Imo  and Asia states enjoy.

8940 2018-09-26 10:59:41 Brent crude #oil is trading over US$81/b for the first time since Nov 2014 - signalling that supply concerns (related to US #sanctions on #Iran) are taking precedence over the weaker demand outlook. But downward pressures should re-emerge in late 2018/early 2019 as demand slows.

8946 2018-09-26 10:58:58 Brooklyn smells like a burnt tire today. Some days it's cooking oil, some days it's low tide, today it's fucking burning rubber. Jesus Christ.
8947 2018-09-26 10:58:52 Having spent two days filming at one of UK's biggest refineries, I can assure you the process does use copious megawatts. Massive substation beside the plant, direct connection to coal fired power station, but they also burn oil to produce final products.
8948 2018-09-26 10:58:52 It's just 10% of their GDP. They can easily stomach that thanks to their oil industry .. or something.

8952 2018-09-26 10:58:31 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes

8971 2018-09-26 10:56:20 We shouldn't worry any more about what Trump wants, the electricity we generate that goes south should be taxed, instead of running the pipelines the mercans want to go through Canada, we could run our oil North and sell it in Europe, and for everything Trump taxes match it.

9049 2018-09-26 10:43:40 Having worked with quite a few Shetlanders in the oil and gas business I got the impression they would rather go it alone than be part of an iScotland. Would the nats afford them (and Orkney) a free vote to opt in or out of an iScotland?
9050 2018-09-26 10:43:32 when NZ was a good place to invest to look for oil and gas, explorers outbid each other to do what they said they’d do the quickest and the Govt wanted to monetise the potential asset as quickly as possible, so drill or drop was a good idea.

9052 2018-09-26 10:42:56 Kevin this explains it to me. Oil was discovered under the North Sea off the shores of Scotland and a country inside the M25 got  exceedingly rich. I don't mind pooling and sharing if Westminster wasn't so corrupt. The M1 should run from Dover to Wick. That's pooling and sharing
9053 2018-09-26 10:42:55 Are you anything other than a “Snake Oil” salesman? You care naught for what you’re selling or whether it will work. You merely seek to find those who want to buy into what you’re pitching. If anybody needs to know what “amoral” means ..

9157 2018-09-26 10:28:38 Emmanuel Macron gave an assessment of the logic of Donald Trump, calling it a dead end. To impose sanctions against Iran, but to demand a reduction in oil prices from OPEC are opposite and mutually exclusive actions.

9319 2018-09-26 10:03:24 Oil lubricates the moving parts so they don't seize by friction, and it contains dispersants that capture particles harmful to those moving parts.  Over time, the oil becomes saturated with those particles and it's lubricating properties break down.

9344 2018-09-26 09:59:10 It's funny u filmed this while driving..  because HAMAS is backed by  gulf states and we need oil.   lol  oil, oil, oil.  that powers the car u r driving.  lol (unless it's electric)  literally sitting on the  reason...
9345 2018-09-26 09:59:08 Absolutely. The new veg-topped version would be a Pizza Vegetariano. Nothing wrong with a 'well-made' fresh Margherita, but I have a suspicion that school pizzas use cheddar, with the base made of dried (not fresh) yeast (could use sourdough), plain flour (not 00) and veg oil!

9603 2018-09-26 09:14:21 @PMOIndia @GST_Council plz give respite to common ppl. Fix the amount in Rs as taxes on fuels rather than generating profit in % on higher crude oil prices. State Govt's should cap the taxes in amount

9607 2018-09-26 09:13:36 Who pays for MNREGA, food security act etc etc. Oil is not our own ghar ki kheti... 80% of oil is imported and bought in dollars. If you can't afford use bicycles.Consuming Oil is not fundamental right. Food and PDS is.

9609 2018-09-26 09:13:18 Fortunately for world, there were stubborn, independent minds in France, Ontario, and Japan that did not succumb to resulting antinuclear activities, but there is no real coincidence in fact that antinuclear movement flourished just as oil & gas became much more valuable
9610 2018-09-26 09:13:17 So in just a week of increase in crude oil price, Buhari have to quickly proof he's not GEJ.

9747 2018-09-26 08:45:44 The rising price of oil is yet another reason why a interconnected national maglev-vactrain public transport system is a wise future investment for the USA, as it circumnavigates non-domestic fuel source reliance.

9800 2018-09-26 08:36:53 I just added a few graphs at the end of the thread. It's not so simple it seems.

What we can infer, though, is that vegetables didn't help, and neither did fruit (we also eat more of those). But industrial seed oil (rise in total fat) wrecked havoc to our health.
9801 2018-09-26 08:36:53 Eh? Are you on the wrong thread? In any case it’s not the price per barrel that matters, it’s the revenue. Scotch oil is very expensive to extract, these days.

9829 2018-09-26 08:34:13 target is 120 perhaps or even more. Some people believe that more expensive the oil and commodities means more growth, there is more income and more money flowing through hands, definition of growth by 21st century economists in favour of capitalism.

9837 2018-09-26 08:32:42 That is an important distinction. The coal to p-chemicals route can be up to 8 times  GHG intensity than from gas & gas liquids, & the crude oil naphtha to chemicals route is only marginally better. But we don’t control if our crude is displacing chemicals prod or transport.
9838 2018-09-26 08:32:34 Why can’t the government purchase the equipment and get consultants to run the project. The investors will simply drill and pump the oil and revenue out of Zimbabwe. Case study Chiadzwa diamonds is a good example.

9866 2018-09-26 08:27:18 i hate it when saying iraq was for oil... the gulf was the oil but saddam lost access post kuwait. iraq oil was to rile the iraqis and deny them their tribal land systems.

9886 2018-09-26 08:23:31 The main fear is that they still somehow manage to lose money on high prices oil prices. The only sign that is bullish is the hype so who knows eh! Hope it goes up for y'all in!

9894 2018-09-26 08:21:40 But both @sciencescanner and @ethanjweiss logic was not sound in this case.  Both were using failed Fish Oil (DHA+EPA mixtures) trials as precedent that pure EPA should also fail.  How can a serious chemist accept that argument?

9904 2018-09-26 08:20:16 I nearly set the whole house on fire this morning, I dropped the bottle of oil on the the hot plate cooker and it went up in flames .. I’m never cooking in the morning again

9916 2018-09-26 08:17:31 AMRN just spent 6-7 yrs generating the proof that you're incorrect.  What evidence do you have to back up your claim?  In fact, there is plenty of clinical evidence to prove the opposite; there is no benefit like that seen in the R-IT Trial from OTC Fish Oil or O-3 supplements.

Was there a control group of non-obese men to monitor the accumulation/reduction of fat mass/composition over time?
Why the combination of full fat > fat free dairy and butter > olive oil?
Why not separate and test for effect of each individually?

9959 2018-09-26 08:10:26 I don't believe there will be a drastic increase which is my point. I've seen estimates of 6kwh used to refine oil per gallon. However I think the reality is the energy used to refine oil comes from the fuel itself. So I think it's just s reduction in carbon emissions.
