38 2018-01-01 23:57:28 An old favorite joke of mine.. ("a vegan an atheist and a crossfitter walk into a bar. I know bc he had told everyone there within 5 minutes.") .. got RUINED this year when I heard someone use in it, "a Bitcoin guy.." LOL then I took offense hah
39 2018-01-01 23:57:21 I really hope youre right!!
40 2018-01-01 23:57:14 おはようございまる
41 2018-01-01 23:57:13 That BTC prediction does not match the dollar value. If it hit .0029 btc at $15,000 per btc it would be like $45 not $25...
42 2018-01-01 23:57:12 The more Bitcoin dominance falls the less likely it is to affect the overall market. Necessary for crypto to continue developing. Cannot rely on the performance of one market.
43 2018-01-01 23:57:07 Ffs how many times does this need to be proven wrong?
44 2018-01-01 23:56:55 I am going to use your @kucoincom referral since no one wants to shill me one... 
45 2018-01-01 23:56:52 I don't FUD, I love crypto. But I do share pertinent info, positive or negative. No biases here.
46 2018-01-01 23:56:49 Doesn't that seem dubious now that it's coming out that much of xrp is owned by the company itself? Lot of crypto twitter seems to be raging on them this weekend.
47 2018-01-01 23:56:47 @coindesk @cointelegraph @cryptocoinsnews can we get an article about how verge $XVG represents everything wrong about crypto, and why such operations do nothing but leave a blackeye on the cryptocurrency community as a whole...thanks!
48 2018-01-01 23:56:14 Just by understanding most people are only motivated by their own self interest than you have a pretty good compass for navigating crypto twitter.
49 2018-01-01 23:56:12 2018 has finally begun let’s crush it this year in crypto. My favourite coin of 2018 - I think it’s still got to be ethereum. The one that got me into crypto. What’s your favourite coin?
50 2018-01-01 23:55:58 wall street traders brag about making a 1.0-1.5x return
crypto traders: brag about making a 10-15x return

magnitudes larger and faster.

@naval described blockchain as a fundamental tech innovation disguised as a "get rich quick scheme"
51 2018-01-01 23:55:33 I am new to the crypto world.  Days feel like months being patient is a new/old lesson to to be relearned.
52 2018-01-01 23:55:24 waves +10% dans la foulée, c'était un moment décisif pour sell il y avait un wall et pas assez dvolume pour break fallait observer sur le moment.
zcl j'ai parlé d'un mois, c'était il y a 3 jours.
salt a échoué il fallait use un stop loss comme je le préconise.
strat +20% enjoy 
53 2018-01-01 23:55:23 So why don’t they have a verification process??

55 2018-01-01 23:54:50 :D haha
56 2018-01-01 23:54:49 Crypto devs lowkey gotta stop with that “Satoshi’s vision” bullshit. Have your own vision and stop trying to feed off of Bitcoin’s success by bringing it into everything you do
57 2018-01-01 23:54:45 sort of thinking the same thing ;)
58 2018-01-01 23:54:43 2018 should get interesting with more new money coming into crypto. If you are ever looking at getting into a new coin, let me know. I will never say no to a good investment opportunity haha
59 2018-01-01 23:54:40 ワロタw
60 2018-01-01 23:54:20 i still remember this guy telling me to invest 10k into his ICO... turns out it was a complete scam. thankful for those crypto gods
61 2018-01-01 23:54:18 And this is why i am scared to buy anything on cryptopia
62 2018-01-01 23:54:08 Amen brother, nice to be in a community where people enjoy giving back. I'm new to crypto currency and a small fish finding my way but I appreciate people like you who think about the littles. Thank you
# xvg big things going to happen in 2018
63 2018-01-01 23:54:00 $SPHTX and $OAX both coins have very good management and trading cheaply
64 2018-01-01 23:53:58 Leave #ETC , not good " HOLD AND HOPE " 
#ETC #BTC #Crypto
65 2018-01-01 23:53:57 I know right? $burst with #dymaxion is one of those crypto opportunities that you can't afford to stay out of. Even a tiny investment might become real life altering money in a year. It's like $BTC's story, but compressed over a much shorter timeframe.
66 2018-01-01 23:53:54 It’s what I got into crypto with first and it’s been good to me. I’d like to believe @SatoshiLite is really doing the right thing. Until he dumped his coins everyone was for it, one person shouldn’t change the future of it.
67 2018-01-01 23:53:49 Should I start crypto blogging in 2018? Hmm... #cryptocurrency #blog #altcoins #bitcoin #trading
68 2018-01-01 23:53:44 $EOS is going to shake folks! My biggest position heading into 2018!!
69 2018-01-01 23:53:39 "The visuals of Trump — the enormous, jiggling bolus of wattle-fat beneath his chin, his squinting visage, the pursed, prissy mouth, the wispy construct of his Manhattan mullet, the knee-length ties, the weirdly crypto-Papal gestures — make him creepily iconic."-Rick's words->
70 2018-01-01 23:53:31 it does seem to be stablizing at a new high. I am learning the crypto market so started with 125$ just to test with my ideas.  I was doing good untill xvg tanked last night.  You guys are still young i hope you learned a bit from this experience.  I like the idea of XVG.
71 2018-01-01 23:53:24 Lots of volume going into $XRP in the last few minutes! Asia waking up soon 
72 2018-01-01 23:53:14 it's 2018. That means it's the year of the crypto's and altcoins! Enormous amounts of money to be made
73 2018-01-01 23:53:11 It's complete HORSE SHIT. All you short term holders of ANY crypto currency under a dollar are so stupid. Why risk your money and adding SO MUCH stress to your life for small baby gains? Oh you made 2k? 10k? 20k? Congrats! Now if you believed in crypto to start.. keep believing!
74 2018-01-01 23:52:58 RIPPLE CRYPTO CURRENCY and Kraken Crytpo exchange are they hand in glove to spike the market against unsuspecting customer while delaying their ID verification???
75 2018-01-01 23:52:56 Bad ass dude, hopefully next year I will make plays like that.  Have a fun ride!
76 2018-01-01 23:52:54 100 JPY(BTC): 1140.021 ~ 1145.922 KRW(BTC)

91 2018-01-01 23:50:14 The blue lines seem to be indicating a "falling wedge" pattern here, which is a bullish reversal pattern signifying the potential end of the downtrend. The arrows I believe are indicating the resistance and support levels.

98 2018-01-01 23:49:51 I'm not arguing for or against your point on communication but you so realize crypto is a huge risk.  Anyone willing to mortgage their house (even for the stock market) better realize you could still take massive losses.  That guy is morr ballsy than me! 
99 2018-01-01 23:49:33 Thats actually true

109 2018-01-01 23:48:27 $RUP has 21 million coins and is aimed at 2.2 billion people. Most of whom don’t have bank accounts. But have mobile phones. The forthcoming app will democratise their finances. It’s potential is msssive.

111 2018-01-01 23:48:27 Crypto is going to change our lives bro let them sleep! 
112 2018-01-01 23:48:21 Dump it and invest in a real project.  #ada #Cardano.  If you are going to invest,  you need to know when to cut your losses.   And you need to research the company. 

Fundamentals for xvg were horrible.   In this case the FUD was real
113 2018-01-01 23:48:20 Das wäre auch meine Frage
114 2018-01-01 23:48:04 Quel esprit tourmenté JS.... 
115 2018-01-01 23:47:57 I am total stranger to them, i'm just a normal young guy, who has been dabling in crypto for year. XVG was lucky buy for me at 80 satsr. I am here because i believe it's a good coin, cmon -  public/private ledgers, having both means it can also be adopted nassively.
116 2018-01-01 23:47:52 Create a network of #crypto #meetups to teach devs #blockchain :D.
117 2018-01-01 23:47:51 there is to much money in the world...
good that these people coming into crypto without education.

#yougotcha
118 2018-01-01 23:47:45 It all depends on who you’re listening to within that genre. Same with regular Hip-Hop. When you say Crypto, you don’t mean like some Superman shit do you?
119 2018-01-01 23:47:24 1. Grow the Crypto Today Show
2. Build a successful business

Could be a good night
123 2018-01-01 23:47:15 Maar hier hebben we het over gehad. Estland heeft overigens eigen crypto-currency.
124 2018-01-01 23:47:14 Thank you brotha! That is the type of stuff that motivates me. 
125 2018-01-01 23:47:11 more like to earths core
126 2018-01-01 23:47:10 The moment it’s easy to spend crypto profits on large items so many new rich will be broke again.
127 2018-01-01 23:47:07 I mean I keep hearing you talk about it but it's not doing a thing. Nice pump
128 2018-01-01 23:47:06 I would like to start this new year with a special thank you to the crypto community for your strong beliefs and perseverance for furtherance of the noble cause of the liberation of currency. The disruption we are amidst is a milestone for mankind.
129 2018-01-01 23:46:53 I hope ur right lol
130 2018-01-01 23:46:40 #edspolls stocks not Crypto

Moon will come sooner or later of course. I am happy though seeing this amazing revolutionary product working!
140 2018-01-01 23:44:49 From your tweets you’re not a crypto fan, so this is not your place..  The #cryptocurrency will grow as it did up to this moment. Every coin has room to grow !!! Go $xvg @vergecurrency

145 2018-01-01 23:44:17 Did you grab this off of other twitters because this has been touted for 3 days and now you’re saying it. Not that you can’t, just wondering if you did your own research or just piggybacked
146 2018-01-01 23:44:15 I got into crypto by watching your videos. Good job bobby

197 2018-01-01 23:40:01 I would tend to agree but keeping in touch with people instead of simply disappearing with no answer helps to keep investor confidence. I hope this hextra gold wasn't a planned all along exit scam.
198 2018-01-01 23:39:58 I like $XRB but this worries me. 
Having no fees is a big problem in crypto. It leaves the blockchain vulnerable to p&d and transaction clogging attacts. Thats why Iota had problems.

202 2018-01-01 23:39:25 #ripple #cardano #stellar all have excellent use cases, roadmaps and verified adoption and integrations. ( a bit less for cardano, but are building some cool stuff). Monero has... privacy? So that people can't find you from what you spend? Not high on my crypto priority.
203 2018-01-01 23:39:23 They need to employ more people to trawl through the verifications.
204 2018-01-01 23:39:23 Manipulation in crypto and stocks. But crypto is more true to human nature(charts) than stocks in my experience. That will change as algo trading increases.
205 2018-01-01 23:39:08 People who only research profit in crypto currencies are not smart. We have to support these beautiful project to improve our world. It is an extraordinary opportunity for every body

226 2018-01-01 23:36:13 ripple is not a ‘crypto currency’. it’s simply a ‘digital coin’ and that’s not the same thing at all. ‘Bitcoin, Etherum, litecoin, dash coin etc. are ‘decentralized cryptos’ ripple is centralized and owned by the banks. just food for thought.

242 2018-01-01 23:34:49 @BTCKYLE What do you think of all these crypto index fund platforms? Stuff like Bit20, upcoming ICO Crypto20, Bitwise, CoinCube, etc. They all seem to greatly outperform Bitcoin over time and seem to strike a nice balance between just holding and actively trading.
243 2018-01-01 23:34:43 Bitcoin and crypto currencies can actually be more sustainable when the replace the brick&mortar bank services, that also consume a lot of energy. Bitcoin "proof of work" algorithm is power hungry, but its software: and software can change when needed.

305 2018-01-01 23:29:10 I know its not that good to compare, but you're crypto Steve Jobs )))))))) wish you all the best with your family and thank you for all the hard work which you presented to us for this NY! Its awesome feeling that I have iron balls to believe and fight with FUD! #xvg $xvg #verge
306 2018-01-01 23:29:10 do you expect bch to grow in few days?
307 2018-01-01 23:29:10 I guess UTK is under the radar. Buyer protection and eliminate seller volatility to receive crypto payments.
308 2018-01-01 23:29:07 Nice!!
309 2018-01-01 23:29:03 2018 Resolution: 

Buy $18 worth of Bitcoin & Add the term ‘crypto-currency investor’ into all social media profiles. 

Lookin forward to the challenge.
310 2018-01-01 23:28:48 No ones really using verge, perhaps they will once these bugs are fixed?
311 2018-01-01 23:28:38 @OPENDIME Their new #Coinkite coldcard hardware wallet looks steampunk AF & CK/OD are great pioneers of crypto security. They're $49 to pre-order so a good low cost option.  Not trying to shill, just really like their products.
312 2018-01-01 23:28:28 too bad they're too chicken-shit to quit their forex jobs and jump ship to crypto.
313 2018-01-01 23:28:11 Because it’s on Bittrex and it will be pumped like everything on there! Check out $KORE on there too, yet to be lit up and another sexy time Masternode coin
314 2018-01-01 23:28:09 Is it any safe to invest in these crypto currencies, when they dont have any backing like the stocks or gold enjoys?

319 2018-01-01 23:27:43 dude you're just an idiot who doesn't understand crypto. this coin was .01 a month ago get real

322 2018-01-01 23:27:26 $s3r 15mill volume @1.4 next few weeks will be very interesting for #serpentinetechnology share price. Market cap still super low #asx #crypto #blockchain
323 2018-01-01 23:27:25 Hey I turned 30 last month into Crypto. Love it
324 2018-01-01 23:27:17 when western entered the external market, not in accordance with roadmeep
325 2018-01-01 23:27:06 Would love to join if a spot opens up. Contacted Bert btw :)
326 2018-01-01 23:27:01 Is it possible not to be a "full-time"
Crypto trader. I mean a very much proofing strategy right now seems to be: buy everything you can afford and hodl. Which I decided to try out. Still its nearly 2am over here and well...
327 2018-01-01 23:26:50 @ToneVays in your opinion what low priced crypto has a chance to really take off this year
328 2018-01-01 23:26:49 Yep nobody mobile shops online anymore
329 2018-01-01 23:26:24 Xlm ilk durak 4200 sats olur bu arada

336 2018-01-01 23:25:40 I feel like applying your charting process to crypto and pulling the trigger on these coins is about to get really addictive!!! Are you addicted to this yet?!? Lol
337 2018-01-01 23:25:38 +1 went away for 3 days and lost touch with everything lmao
338 2018-01-01 23:25:16 Is there a charity donation on the crypto sites on here?
339 2018-01-01 23:25:13 Apple will definitely incorporate Blockchain technology in the near future. One crypto you know nothing about can make you rich
340 2018-01-01 23:25:07 なんか可愛い
341 2018-01-01 23:25:06 If you wish profiting so high by legal by centralize crypto and don't like waisting your time to buy or change your valuta for it.
342 2018-01-01 23:25:02 Fake
343 2018-01-01 23:24:56 Yeah man project has improved nicely, but in that times was meh... so took my x3 and ran away haha. But you are totally right man. More trains will come as always anyway :)
344 2018-01-01 23:24:36 バージ界隈はFUDという意見もあるみたいだけどもう売り始まってるね。さてさてどうなる
345 2018-01-01 23:24:29 $APEX
346 2018-01-01 23:24:22 It seems to me that the Secure Enclave on iOS supports the same kind of crypto as U2F (secp256r1). Puzzling that no one has utilized this for a yubikey-like alternative.
347 2018-01-01 23:24:21 Yes please. Thanks for that :)
348 2018-01-01 23:24:15 What is a Satoshi?

353 2018-01-01 23:23:50 What’s an ICO your interested in right now?
354 2018-01-01 23:23:31 お年玉の1万円で億入りしちゃった理系中高校生沢山いそうですね。理系好きな人て情報沢山あつめたり大人の話を沢山きいてそうだから。
355 2018-01-01 23:23:28 I prefer the FED than your scam! 
I prefer to pay taxes than to feed Jihan Wu and Rogers sociopath ideas.
I prefer politicians that have not yet been convicted to the band of criminals that promote the chinese mafia knock off. 
Bcash is the ultimate crypto trash,just deal with it
356 2018-01-01 23:23:22 Actually, the fondest dream of people like me is to find a way to subject a government to free-market competition and watch it be run peacefully out of business. The crypto-economy shows promise of developing into just such a method, eventually.
357 2018-01-01 23:23:10 U missed the Birth of cryptodogs ;(

359 2018-01-01 23:22:57 Gain/loss reporting is basically a joke with crypto currency
360 2018-01-01 23:22:56 @Crawfords2012 what’s your XLM short term price prediction
361 2018-01-01 23:22:56 Too late to the game?
362 2018-01-01 23:22:55 @CoinMarketCap will you be adding new features in the future such as “ account sign in , favourite crypto watchlist etc “ ? #needed #badly
363 2018-01-01 23:22:52 Which is more likely considering the data you currently have? That they will, or they won't?

BitPay, we know is in the process of adding it. So we already know FOR SURE that the biggest player in the crypto payment processing market IS 100% adding $BCH.

371 2018-01-01 23:22:03 Like my man @BitcoinTre said. The only crypto I’m selling in 2018 is #Bitcoin and that’s ONLY to buy other altcoins 
372 2018-01-01 23:21:58 @westerncoiner when western entered the external market, not in accordance with roadmeep
373 2018-01-01 23:21:58 I have told many friends over time about getting their money in #Crypto - and I hate knowing, that the ones that didn't, are making/have made the single biggest mistake of their lives.
374 2018-01-01 23:21:52 Check my pinned tweet for Kucoin link
375 2018-01-01 23:21:41 Do u not see the oppressor vs oppressed narrative sharing any philosophical dogma with Marxism?
376 2018-01-01 23:21:30 J’ai été trop gourmand j’avais mit un order à 95... perdu il est aller jusqu’à 92  On va croiser les doigts pour la 2ème vague alors !
377 2018-01-01 23:21:27 Who wants to shill me a #Kucoin referral?? Anyone... 
378 2018-01-01 23:21:26 Love your vids crypto gat! Learned a lot. Also got the 21cryptos release definitely worth it. Thanks!
379 2018-01-01 23:21:26 But I don't think crypto will replace banks etc. anytime soon. I think the majority of the people don't know much about crypto, and maybe even a larger percentages don't even want a big change. 
Of course here on twitter you can find many, but you won't find that majority here.
380 2018-01-01 23:21:25 religious fanatics bcashesr are now bigger than scientology on crypto twiiter

387 2018-01-01 23:20:40 Rand, that sucks. With these low sat coins - if I don't need the profits I always hold on until better times. And with proper position sizes that becomes easier and easier.
388 2018-01-01 23:20:38 Agreed $POT looks like it has broken out of the wedge - I suspect the others will follow
389 2018-01-01 23:20:31 That's my plan. But crypto moves fast and these losses suck lol
390 2018-01-01 23:20:30 I'm a vegetarian crypto investor that does crossfit.

396 2018-01-01 23:19:50 @VitalikButerin I’m a Canadian, went to school in the states. Have to pay off student loans in Canada while working in the states. I know I’m not an unbanked one. But crypto sure has made it a lot easier to pay the loans off. Thanks #dontleave
397 2018-01-01 23:19:42 Looking for ways to compile crypto world information into very easy to understamd sentences. Frome some people to the people.
398 2018-01-01 23:19:42 Should I buy?

 @MizkoMedia - Establish partnerships with 5 high-growth and calibered startups. Keeping us exclusive. 

 Strong focus on personal finance.

 Continue HODL my crypto.

406 2018-01-01 23:18:44 I think there will be so many crypto-currencies, they will all collapse and go down as another pet rock or beanie baby fad. Gold and silver will go up to 1800/25dollars in the aftermath. I agree with you on the unified Korea. Will get Trump the Nobel Peace Prize.

414 2018-01-01 23:17:49 Merchants are going to need a platform for accounting and point-of-sale. Very few merchants are sophisticated enough to buy their own. 99.99% of merchants accepting crypto will be going through payment processors. That's just a given.
415 2018-01-01 23:17:49 Haha no! Don’t have any computer background so I felt like I was deep in the matrix when I was entering commands on putty 
416 2018-01-01 23:17:48 Hey boss, I can't message you but I definitely want in on your telegram. I'm starting with very little in crypto but I have no intentions of quitting without taking care of my wife and baby on the way.

418 2018-01-01 23:17:39 Well done on that call, as many of us do in crypto, but you remind me of the religious devout who claim to prophesizes of the greatness of their God's which I must say you are not.

423 2018-01-01 23:17:25 One can only hope and dream.   Do you really think Ripple would want this news to come out too quickly?   Part of me thinks not.  On the other hand, such news has to happen eventually anyway.
424 2018-01-01 23:17:22 How is/was vegas?

428 2018-01-01 23:17:02 You seem to think crypto is here to do your bidding. Did your mommy tell you you're smart, too? Is that why you think you're an einstein and not yet another retarded monkey? How's that $RDD moonshot working out for you?

457 2018-01-01 23:13:47 Great videos. I would suggest breaking down the tech of the cryptos you hold and why u choose them over some of the shit coins out there. Also some step by step how to vids on using some of these exchanges would help us newbies. Made my first gdax trade thanks to your vid!
458 2018-01-01 23:13:43 Favorite of 2017 and 2018: $DRGN  Congrats to all hodlers!
459 2018-01-01 23:13:35 A successful crypto needs more than just mining to succeed. Why should miners get all the block rewards?

474 2018-01-01 23:11:27 Without getting into the "crypto" discussion, I would be remiss not to point out John Nash' notion of an "e-currency" that might sustain enough Equalibrium to make CBs do exactly that- upgrade. I think we are seeing Nash may have been right.

484 2018-01-01 23:10:53 My OP was about merchants accepting, not processors.  I think from the perspective of a crypto replacing cash, not being instantly converted to cash.

Do you have a link that supporting your claims on Coinbase will add BCH to their merchant platform?

492 2018-01-01 23:09:49 I find that talking about crypto goes south real fast.
493 2018-01-01 23:09:49 I think that's what is happening.  BTC is beginning to behave like a digital gold.  People are losing trust in their institutions - government, banking, finance, etc.  So crypto becomes a natural hedge against that.
494 2018-01-01 23:09:37 The gamble is staying in this crypto. All of my other cryptos have working, reliable wallets. Good luck.

505 2018-01-01 23:08:38 It was an investment until I did research about 2 weeks ago and felt it could be a scam. I'm a hodler by nature but have investment parameters -- when a crypto gets above a certain % as part of the portfolio, I sell the excess off to get into other stuff.

574 2018-01-01 23:02:25 The masses don't value decentralization. Neither do institutional investors. $XRP isn't in competition with $BTC. It will help the adoption of crypto.
575 2018-01-01 23:02:24 Not solely, no. New technologies, deals, developments, features and all sorts push the value up. But the golden rule of crypto is not to follow the crowd. When everyone buys, sell, when everyone sells, buy.

595 2018-01-01 23:00:38  Thank U !!!
596 2018-01-01 23:00:12 It’s easier to buy a gun than it is to buy crypto.
597 2018-01-01 23:00:11 Quite the sell block on binance at 60
598 2018-01-01 23:00:08 The issue the cannabis industry has in the states is it's not legal federally. Hence just states like California making it legal. The industry can't access bank funding due to the federal issue. So they turned to crypto. More in an older tweet. $pot

612 2018-01-01 22:58:41 Sorry, im still fuzzy. I asked how long can the handle conventionally be before its deemed a broken/failed handle and pattern formation?
613 2018-01-01 22:58:39 I love the crypto community! Amazing people who want to help and bring awareness to the world.
614 2018-01-01 22:58:30 I feel sorry to call someone paid marketer without evidence. I am sorry for that. But i know that many coins have twitter army and they get paid regularly. Each centralized coin has a dedicated marketing team and a twitter army.
615 2018-01-01 22:58:29 They've been good with me. 

I am having an issue with a no connection status though. I've made a ticket, I hope they can respond.
616 2018-01-01 22:58:23 My company and I have worked for fixed crypto. 3 bitcoins per week. Initially $300 per bitcoin on a contract that ended a little bit before bitcoin touched $10,000 a week. The customer did not break the contract and we simply worked harder to provide the increased value.

624 2018-01-01 22:57:43 First off you have not been in crypto longer then me. Second, I know that lol but it has over 1.5M users and they're releasing an ICO next week that will only drive more people to it. Is it sustainable forever? No. But will it be for a long time? Yes, is it profitable? Yes

There are probably 1000 other $crypto projects that will do very well. These calls are for long term projects w/ the potential to reach multi-trillion $ mcaps.
648 2018-01-01 22:53:43 Deep pockets don't like holding money through the holidays. You will also have alot of media hyping as all these new years countdowns start talking about crypto.  Tax returns + cryptomania = Growth.
649 2018-01-01 22:53:43 I mean...I should probably keep abreast of all things crypto these days, no?
650 2018-01-01 22:53:42 Listen. $kucoin is positioning itself nicely for 2018. It's almost like you have to deal with them to get in on some of the new projects. $DRGN will be huge in 2018. #KuCoin has them. #EasyMoney
651 2018-01-01 22:53:26 In defense of that sign we could always have a stock/ crypto market crash so it is a good idea to have a significant amount of cash on hand. And that is better than the average cd lol

664 2018-01-01 22:52:13 At such a low amount it might seem like a great buy, but in all investment strategies look to diversify your portfolio & only invest what your willing to loose. The crypto world is a true Wild West right now but with a growing economy and more support in time stability will come.

679 2018-01-01 22:50:01 XVG is quite possibly the biggest Bitcoin rival. The tech is amazing and has a great team behind it. It is filling a void in which other crypto currencies cannot. Buy now or regret later. #XVG $xvg #XVGFam @XVGWhale @justinvendetta

686 2018-01-01 22:49:16 I just read the Eula update for 2018 for a major u.s. exchange and it makes it sound like using local bitcoins is now illegal. #crypto #trading
687 2018-01-01 22:49:12 People are mad because they come into this market thinking they know every damn thing. And yet, they get their dick slapped. I'm a true supporter of #XVG #verge is the future of crypto.
688 2018-01-01 22:48:54 #xrp Let's help get the brilliant @dreventures get the 25k+ subscribers he deserves.. Anyone interested in safely storing crypto(especially XRP) check out his channel and rate his content. He is a true gem of honest educational content free of gimmicks and b.s. A positive force!
689 2018-01-01 22:48:46 The scary thing is if it does become a thing, the government can still control it by creating regulations to ruin it. It's a bit of a lose lose. Crypto is still very young in technology, so proving you wrong is impossible atm.
690 2018-01-01 22:48:38 Just curious, what kind of crypto do you have right now? I’m only just dipping a toe. Got one gpu mining pirl mostly at the moment. It’s small for now but I’m happy with the returns so far.
691 2018-01-01 22:48:31 Do we actually need anonymous votes? The UK does not have anonymous votes - ballot paper numbers can be checked against the book of registered voters if really necessary. But it's on paper and so really slow and hard. Crypto would achieve the same thing.

696 2018-01-01 22:47:36 You know.. for the average thinking human, I can see how they think of this as just a ehh whatever.. but the ones that really know what's going on with this coin. It's huge. This is going to change crypto.
697 2018-01-01 22:47:36 Charlie can finally "speak freely" without the blame for something can always be given to him. People are not stupid either, they will gradually understand more and more who is honest in Crypto and who is not.

714 2018-01-01 22:45:56 I am not yet good at picking up the trends. BCO was the only one I could predict had potential. But I feel like learning every aspect of crypto and you are the motivation for mining and infused
715 2018-01-01 22:45:41 This neet shilled wraith for a week that it would be released 100% in 2017, now hes deflecting the topic entirely and most of you are too blinded by bliss to even understand what's going on.

733 2018-01-01 22:43:25 And before you continue with your buffoonery, any person in marketing will easily tell you: for a product to become successful, best case scenario is to win over the consumer while they're still "kids".

739 2018-01-01 22:42:51 À partir du moment où fut décidée la chute de l’Empire ottoman, celui-ci a donc été soumis à deux types d’agression : d’une part, une agression interne, sous la forme d’une révolution préparée par un réseau crypto-juif redoutablement efficace, d’autre part, une agression externe
740 2018-01-01 22:42:47 I am sorry this tweet is from 2 years ago lol! I didn't ever use twitter but I need it now to keep up with crypto currency sites!
741 2018-01-01 22:42:41 Hey thanks for that! Had some real fear there as it fell out of support. Hope you caught something on this.
742 2018-01-01 22:42:37 Dominance over what? Is bitcoin's market cap the best way to measure its relevance? Isn't bitcoin the conduit by which people are getting in and out of crypto, thereby obfuscating the picture?

744 2018-01-01 22:42:08 Kind enough to hear your opinion in verge
745 2018-01-01 22:42:08 Somehow get the trash out of the live stream comments.  I know it's not possible but man is it annoying.  Then interview John MCAFEE.  We'll set it up like a MMA pay-per-view event.

750 2018-01-01 22:41:47 I read this morning: "This is huge guys! IBM is in the process of starting an exchange that will CRUSH Coinbase and Gemini both! Being able to exchange fiat to 30+ crypto coins without the need to swap USD to BTC to an alt coin. The site is said to go live Q1 of 2018."
751 2018-01-01 22:41:45 I have made this mistake ! I am learning the hard way
752 2018-01-01 22:41:42 I will also say it is funny that you uphold stem and Peterson. He is about as science friendly as a phrenologist. Jungianism is mystical nonsense.
753 2018-01-01 22:41:32 $OK $okcash is forming a nice bull flag on the 30min chart right now, second wave incoming.

754 2018-01-01 22:41:25 Depends on how big the market is. I'll tell u what, if wallet to wallet transfers are easy, teens and young adults (the primary demographic to really grow this tech) will likely flock to the coins that seem "cool" and easy to use. #XVG fits that; I'm not yet convinced #PART does

759 2018-01-01 22:41:03 What crypto exchange do you recommend for buying/trading? Having trouble finding a legit service that’s accepting new users right now.
760 2018-01-01 22:41:03 Bought my first 1btc Dec 2015 @ $950, not aware of altcoins yet, i sold 0.75btc in January, almost got rekd as a noob in june wt rdd, pulled out of crypto, only to lose the remaining 0.25btc in July to a sugar-coated ponzi

Had to restart by Nov. with $100 now that I'm learning
761 2018-01-01 22:40:44 I got my hands on Mario Oddyssy 1 day before release and already there was a patch !!!  Yes folks , even Nintendo patches their games
762 2018-01-01 22:40:43 Any tips on buying areas for BTCS BTSC? They look like potential huge gainers for 2018 following the crypto hype.
763 2018-01-01 22:40:38 I like it, but cant make myself send money to shitbtc or risk losing it all by sending to finex.

766 2018-01-01 22:40:12 Plenty of tweets with people confirming it works. The wallets need fixing, which they are in the process of.
767 2018-01-01 22:40:02 That's not good, but it might be running smoother right now. But nobody should pay fees like that in #crypto. Imagine paying over $500 in fees for 50k transfer.
768 2018-01-01 22:39:54 hey man, we all make mistakes.. as long as you learn from them 
769 2018-01-01 22:39:52 I think $POE is one of the best investments available right now at $0.09! It has tripled in value in the last few days, and offers great leverage. It's a great platform for attribution and proving ownership of media creation.
770 2018-01-01 22:39:47 Agar kohi $500 nahi dey saktha tu crypto main usney Kia invest karna hai
771 2018-01-01 22:39:42 @karl_dot_tech is there an analogue to PoW verification for Casper? i.e. some way to verify that a block is part of the canonical history and not just made up by the data provider? Any specific reading would be appreciated 
772 2018-01-01 22:39:38 Same here in hitbtc
773 2018-01-01 22:39:37 Which becomes ultimately contradictory and, as Jameson says, a logic of late capitalism.
774 2018-01-01 22:39:30 true words!

788 2018-01-01 22:38:18 Glad you could compile words to state nothing. Actually you derive levels from anything trading and risk can always be mitigated. Had you any real experience aside from trading your own crypto account your words may have merit, but since you can’t even articulate a thought
789 2018-01-01 22:38:05 I oppose post structuralism but on order to do it properly means actually reading what they write and a large part of that is their rejection of Marxist claims to universalism.
790 2018-01-01 22:38:03 Count me in...
791 2018-01-01 22:38:03 For Binance, you should look into TRON (TRX). I use Bittrex, HitBTC, Binance, EtherDelta.
792 2018-01-01 22:37:42 just wanted to throw my twit into the ring here... please don't delete my twit
793 2018-01-01 22:37:42 To buy a #crypto coin:
1. Focus on the fundamental aspects: the quality of the equipment, its problems, the solutions or the business.
2. Technical analysis is secondary. The resistances will fall, one after the other, before the overwhelming strength of the foundations.
794 2018-01-01 22:37:32 Like it I’m in!
795 2018-01-01 22:37:31 Don't sleep on the @LiskHQ rebranding in February. Take a long term position, or "buy the rumor, sell the news." Crypto is so fickle that you can still buy Lisk at a reasonable price, and if nothing else, it will rise before the rebranding.
796 2018-01-01 22:37:30 Strat, with booming releases?
797 2018-01-01 22:37:24 Actually 5th January
798 2018-01-01 22:37:16 They manipulate the price of gold with paper contracts. It’s good to diversify with gold, silver and a few innovative crypto currencies.
799 2018-01-01 22:37:14 Australia banks had put a hault on deposits into crypto exchanges thought the holidays.. They are about to start trading again.. billions of Christmas dollar's waiting to hit the market!!

818 2018-01-01 22:35:28 If you invested $2,000 ($100 in the top 20) in crypto currency on Jan 1, 2016. That would currently be worth $148,000 #Crypto #bitcoin #altcoin

If you want some advice from people making moves in crypto then come with intelligent questions. We are not here to do your research. I don’t say when to buy or when to sell. Read more!!!
839 2018-01-01 22:32:17 AltcoinPars you gotta DYOR too. I thought I gave you enough info already
840 2018-01-01 22:32:05 My prediction for 2018. Bitcoin will no longer be the #1 crypto currency....and I don't consider ETH, XRP and such as a currency.
841 2018-01-01 22:32:05 shittt... how about you become my 21st follower... how do you get to 9k, and say you aint the queen of crypto? be real girl, thats legit as fck
842 2018-01-01 22:32:00 Have no regrets. Can't have any of that in crypto. You'll give yourself an ulcer overthinking everything. Be happy you get in when you did, and just relax and hold for the long term. Contribute however you can to the community and understand the technology behind it :)
843 2018-01-01 22:31:52 It seems that there's a myriad of #crypto out there and all of them sound like they are trying to accomplish the same thing. Do half of them use a whitepaper generator? Is there such a thing as a WP generator.. ?? I should write a whitepaper about this!

847 2018-01-01 22:31:27 Strong with the low price per coin you are!
So $PART would be a tough sell at 1.6B value, a 20 person paid team and a marketplace for coins like $xvg (use case).
But 26B value, 1 person unpaid dev with no utility besides speculation plus that's up 800000% isn't out of question 
848 2018-01-01 22:31:27 Happy new year! 2018 is going to be a great year for crypto currency! Anyone have any thoughts or coins I should talk about on tomorrow’s video?  Feel free to contact me!

852 2018-01-01 22:31:02 Bitcoin transfer times are BIGLY exaggerated. Mine took only 10minutes just short time ago today. 10 minutes. Do not believe people who claim #Bitcoin takes hours/days/weeks to transfer. #BTC $BTC #Crypto

(Fees are still insane though, 1.1% from the sum I transfered. Too big.)
853 2018-01-01 22:31:00 Markets re-open for 2018, i still have another 24h if vacation to go. Bullish across US indices, Crypto adding XRP on dips, keen to invest in Iota. Tracking emerging opps in FX & Commods.
854 2018-01-01 22:30:59 Is haha
855 2018-01-01 22:30:47 Exactly. Everything is taken care of with banks. I don’t have to worry about anything.
Even if the bank fall over I get my money back. (For most people)
With crypto currencies I lose money if I lose a key.

859 2018-01-01 22:30:10 I feel you man. The hype and fud around xvg has been insane. IMO if it was dead we would have seen it die, for real. Little crypto boys see dips and their world falls apart lol.
860 2018-01-01 22:30:09 With #Wraith #verge has a public and private ledger. Verge still implements Tor in both cases to provide total obfuscation of IP addresses in both cases. NO OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCY provides this ability to switch between public and fully anonymous transactions. #xvg $xvg #crypto
861 2018-01-01 22:30:08 Too many weak ppl invested money hoping to gain instant profit and need constant reassuring from so many levels to keep their coins in the wallet. Those people shouldn’t be allowed to invest before demonstrating basic knowledge of the crypto they are buying.
862 2018-01-01 22:30:04 @SatoshiLite You‘ll be appreciated as THE Leonardo da Vinci of the Crypto World!
863 2018-01-01 22:29:52 Thanks for always sharing your knowledge @SatoshiLite Much appreciated as I learn this Crypto game.

869 2018-01-01 22:29:24 Trading crypto has 2 elements. One is long term investing based on solid tech and companies. The other is short term swing trading. Most important with swings is to be willing to take a lose and to move on.
870 2018-01-01 22:29:18 chance to compete. This competition could provide for better services and even threaten larger institutions if they don’t adapt. Ripple is also connecting the mainstream financial world to the crypto world, which only benefits all of crypto. So if you don’t like Ripple, 2/3
871 2018-01-01 22:29:17 Now looking into another crypto to invest in. Been watching #PacCoin Gotta say the returns currently are massive. It’s up 180% today alone. Yesterday It mooned as well. Seriously take a look. Only way to currently buy is direct or via dogecoin.
872 2018-01-01 22:29:16 PMの間違いでは？
873 2018-01-01 22:29:11 The kid heading the world's biggest Crypto onramp doesn't understand the difference between BTC and the most idiotic scam ever, xrp. This shows how early we are.

879 2018-01-01 22:28:58 I can go further and talk about the debates in the concept and form journal on the 70s where the Marxist structuralists were antagonistic to the post structuralists and were publishing Russell and works on math
880 2018-01-01 22:28:50 I forgot to tweet this but #HAPPYNEWYEARS! To my tech, crypto, photo and festival-friends, Love you to all! And, to you all, I wish the most success, love and good health you can get this year. <3
881 2018-01-01 22:28:48 Definitely ARK. Maybe consider some $RUP

883 2018-01-01 22:28:45 So I just discovered $NLC2 and holy shit is this one hell of a sleeper. This is the ONLY coin in fantasy sports industry and has NO competitor. Market cap is only 40mil and coin is cheap. It will be a monster this year.

931 2018-01-01 22:24:08 Look at the gif he posted.... Use your own opinion... Does it have anything to do with XVG, crypto? That's not his, a different persons face is top right and water mark bottom right. Look and form your own opinion... The post is BS
932 2018-01-01 22:24:03 Cool, i would like to have one.
933 2018-01-01 22:23:53 I think everyone got fed up with the lack of communication and how the countdown was handled.. A LOT of us lost sleep waiting to make sure our money won't disappear when the bottom drops out.  It was treated more like a pump/dump. The @xvgwhale didn't know when to shut up either.
934 2018-01-01 22:23:44 Ha, no joke! Patience will make you rich in crypto.
935 2018-01-01 22:23:39 I'm arguing principe. You're arguing appeal to authority fallacy. The kind of buying you are talking about is only good when you want to protect wealth and hedge. But you have to be able to identify the support before you can do that. And crypto is not a space in which that 1/
936 2018-01-01 22:23:16 its lookin more brightly than few hours ago.
937 2018-01-01 22:23:13 i heard you the crypto queen. thats whats up
938 2018-01-01 22:23:05 Exactly. THe real value is soooo unknown since everyone is trying to only get it for an investment, causing a huge inflation in the market. If people hoarded US Dollars. But the great thing on crypto is market caps, whereas government can duplicate USD and make unlimited supply
939 2018-01-01 22:23:01 You going to eat a hat I heard?
940 2018-01-01 22:22:47 If you see valid criticism or caution labelled as FUD on a forum, be worried. People will label real criticism FUD to protect their own bags.
941 2018-01-01 22:22:45 So true. Some get way too defensive over there portfolio

950 2018-01-01 22:22:02 True, but more things will need to be purchasable with pure crypto for that to work, right now people still see it as a way to hold money until you convert it back into fiat

969 2018-01-01 22:20:32 To be honest it’s a bunch of children that want to get rich quick. Most of them (Fud creators) are holding less than 10,000 XVG. In the last 2-3 weeks everyone has become some sort of crypto wizard. Just let @justinvendetta do his thing.

985 2018-01-01 22:19:10 People, let’s stop trying to make tons of money out of someone else’s work. The only way of loosing money is by selling; you can be down, but you are not loosing until you sell. Only invest what you are willing to loose.
986 2018-01-01 22:19:10 Sometimes the best trades are those you already made. Give your positions time to play out 

Patience and success are strongly related 

And when i speak of patience i mean weeks, not years.
This is crypto... not the fucking stock market

989 2018-01-01 22:18:54 A man with ethics in a unethical crypto world.  It's refreshing to see some one keep it real. In 2017 we had so many #ICO scams + crappy ALTs Coins with little utility, pumped by social media toutsters . I think #Litecoins adoption and technical merits will do the talking in 2018
990 2018-01-01 22:18:51 Me too
991 2018-01-01 22:18:44 Shame really this token is not possible to trade for BTC on reputable exchange. Thanks @Haejin_Crypto for your next TA.

1028 2018-01-01 22:15:56 Will @Ripple be added on @coinbase in the near future?
I would think so, even with all the hate on ripple, it's 2nd place @CoinMarketCap, that can't be ignored.

1029 2018-01-01 22:15:47 Yo @Brookes_Haven send me a screen of your trades on binance, show these people I got you into the quick flippin of crypto
1030 2018-01-01 22:15:43 Done Been a Hodl . Would appreciate some tip :-  D8iXiKqF2zV32KRNseeQnRGYqQbMiifStP
1031 2018-01-01 22:15:40 Crypto was full of new world order type people, and then high risk investors started to get involved, now the low risk banks see the benefits, and those original conspiracy theory guys cannot handle that their dream of bringing down the banks was never going to happen anyway!
1032 2018-01-01 22:15:39 I actually like that picture
1033 2018-01-01 22:15:38 Got some #firstblood #1ST and added to my $NMR bag

1035 2018-01-01 22:15:30 wouldnt this mean it will pump even harder in the face of all the alex jones loving plebs who hate govt? seems like the same reason I bag held gold for 10years . but if btc is propelled by the people and not the banks, then maybe crypto kids will search for another asset? twt
1036 2018-01-01 22:15:27 That is porn.
1037 2018-01-01 22:15:20 Mluvíš o Crypto nebo akciových trzích?
1038 2018-01-01 22:15:16 I dont need a BANK. Banks are evil cartels for moving other people's money and using it without their knowledge for their own profits.  Crypto is freedom from that paradigm.. and RIPPLE knows it which is why it attempts to be something its not. CRYPTO
1039 2018-01-01 22:15:09 Everything mooning = time to sell???

1042 2018-01-01 22:14:34 We at Crypto World News are happy for your continued success.
We see the future bright for you and the team in 2018
(Im holding for the long term)
Congrats
1043 2018-01-01 22:14:31 Do a YouTube live later so I can actually get in on it I work later so I can never watch it and ask questions 
1044 2018-01-01 22:14:14 Sounds like someone doesn't know what it means to take profits after a 1300% pump. Again, I sold at 2k as my final exit with all my buys sub 50 sats. It's 1250 now. 1250 is less than 2k. People like you are why the XVG community is the laughing stock of the crypto world.

1101 2018-01-01 22:08:05 Xrp being up 33,000% may be accurate, but it's not the best performing crypto. That is a fact, thus making this chart or whatever it is, inaccurate.
1102 2018-01-01 22:07:55 Fuck the haters and the fickle fuckers out there! This project is the essence of what crypto is about. Fuck deadlines to appease the masses, excited to see what where #wraithprotocol goes! @justinvendetta

1104 2018-01-01 22:07:39 Dumb reply. I'm a consumer in the crypto market. I expect professionalism.
1105 2018-01-01 22:07:37 Definitely a trend. That does not mean BTC won’t be valuable, it just won’t be the center of the crypto universe. It’ll be part of the core constellation of platforms though.
1106 2018-01-01 22:07:31 Why not?
See crypto currencies. In the best case scenario, in the long run, 2 or 3 will survive.
Nevertheless some are making lots of money now. 
Do you prefer to see it happen not being part of it because you don't believe in it or to make money?

1135 2018-01-01 22:05:08 Watching a PM debate another PM is like watching the fabric of logic unravel. I’m sure you’ve seen it and experienced it.. words change and lose meaning and and definitions change till the point language itself is deconstructed
1136 2018-01-01 22:05:06 Very exciting start to a new year. Thanks for the hard work on $XVG
1137 2018-01-01 22:04:54 A global crises is primarily affecting trust in fiat, meaning the trust will decrease with each consecutive economic downturn. I see it's good for crypto. In 2008 all 3 major banks in Cyprus crashed on the same day. People could only withdraw 50€ a day, no matter how much money
1138 2018-01-01 22:04:50 Yes, the new rule now effectively means all crypto transactions are a taxable event. Day traders are going to get flayed. Unless you trade on something that doesn't attach your identity to your account. KuCoin is the best one & will overtake Binance.
1139 2018-01-01 22:04:48 Thanks so much for all your efforts mate. You’re doing an awesome job! Don’t listen to the haters. And thanks for informing us

I don't just support projects because I want to make monetary gains. I support projects because I see them changing the world. not all, but some

1144 2018-01-01 22:04:29 Which is why that site is irrelevant in the first place, as from what I've read, only Tor was incorporated into version 4.0. So how does monitoring transactions from an older version without Tor have any relevance? The road map never stated version 3.0 would hide IPs....

1173 2018-01-01 22:02:31 Nah, she won. $XRP is a crypto (cryptographically signed) currency (has value, you can spend it). It's quite easy to understand when you open your mind.

1176 2018-01-01 22:02:12 Wraith appears to be a big success at first glance... however the PR was a nightmare. Good thing is... tech is more important.

#HODL - Misspelt HOLD or Hold On (for) Dear Life
#FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out
#FUD - Fear Uncertainty Doubt

1186 2018-01-01 22:01:33 Yup. The problem is, there are so many new people to Crypto just finding their way, they will pounce on unfounded news for FOMO.

Need to keep it real and the XRP community is excelling at, while pumping, remaining truthful to what are facts and what are rumors.

1213 2018-01-01 21:59:22 Ok, fine, I actually did participate but acting like it’s dangerous to say who won seems disingenuous because every person holding crypto would be at risk for just saying so under those terms, even yourself. Every authentic giveaway I have been in announced winners.
1214 2018-01-01 21:59:19 People are here for a quick buck, and switch among other currencies to “get the pump” I’ve Researched XVG, and I’ve fallen in love. #XVG is the definition of crypto, when the world opens their eyes.. they’ll see. The FUD.. Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies - #XVGFam  HODL.

1221 2018-01-01 21:58:43 I do believe success in crypto requires an element of retarded naïveté. I think being informed comes with diminishing returns. My biggest gainz came from taking the advice of racist strangers and randomly buying.
1222 2018-01-01 21:58:41 Very informative channel! The transparency with your portfolio gives a sense of authenticity. A weekly or monthly pick of coins looking to breakout would help

1228 2018-01-01 21:58:24 Om hierop terug te komen; ik ben voor mezelf inmiddels overtuigd van holden. Long-term.

1230 2018-01-01 21:58:22 Right, and I'm not saying that he is or isn't ethical. I have no idea, but my point is no one else does either.  IMO, what he's accused of even if true is very tame by crypto Twitter standards. Look at the founders of most alt coins and ICOs, or guys like CSW

1304 2018-01-01 21:52:10 I'm sure I've read much more than you. In order to get a PhD I had to be familiar with the canon. You know comprehensive exams, thesis, etc. If you think I'm a post-modernist you are completely out to lunch.

1332 2018-01-01 21:50:17 You crack me up. Thank you. :)
1333 2018-01-01 21:49:55 yep. I seriously think advertising crypto investments to retail investors in any manner whatsoever is unethical and needs to be stopped.
1334 2018-01-01 21:49:46 So u are also obviously already committed to PM thought. And for someone to “deconstruct” it is hazardous to u? Also I’m tired of the list of books argument as thought critical thought and debate aren’t possible or valid forms of communication.

1340 2018-01-01 21:49:27 As a new years resolution I decided I would do a better job of organizing my crypto activity, and setting myself up for success. Crypto twitter has proved to be an amazing resource and community thus far. Looking forward to learning and contributing with all of you.

1351 2018-01-01 21:48:39 Every project that I feel like it’s solid I hold.. even if it drop 50% I’m absolutely not in panic.. I’m very comfortable with drops and projects that i support.. but I’ll take time to read the white paper and check out the team before I invest..

1389 2018-01-01 21:46:18 Seems like the SEC would be interested since crypto are securities.  Clearly actions would be illegal.

1412 2018-01-01 21:44:17 become a full time crypto investor.  travel the world attending conferences.  contribute somehow in promoting cryptos and replacing/bringing down the fiat financial system.  this will lead to increasing political decentralization and increased individual freedom.are we ready?

I missed so many opportunities but believe me a few cents will not be a big deal in the long run. Wish U all the best.

1437 2018-01-01 21:42:16 Nah, I have no desire to hold crypto. The only reason I didn’t immediately liquidate the wallet when I found it is it was Stellar/Lumens, so I needed to research the best path to transfer it into USD

1442 2018-01-01 21:41:49 How diverse is your crypto? Mine is about 10. What's your favorite alts? Mine are XRP and XLM. What shitcoin do believe in? I'm betting a little on trx, dgb and pot.

1450 2018-01-01 21:41:16 No you're just buying into their prepumped coins, since they announce it on their groups before they put it on twitter, and their profit will be your breakeven.

probably.

Check the charts, the tweets just tell you where to look.
1451 2018-01-01 21:41:01 Wouldn't that also help the price go up overall?

1456 2018-01-01 21:40:39 We went up about 33 X in Market cap in the #crypto market in 2017.  Im projecting about 61 X in 2018 best case.  Or about 48X worst case.  I can feel the buying pressure building, Also the new tax law will cause more holding and less trading which means less supply for new money

1462 2018-01-01 21:40:21 I've always liked $XVG but I'm not sure I would buy above 1000 sats.
Unless I wanted to hold for a very long time.
This is true EVEN if $XVG goes to 2000 tomorrow.
Regardless of the drama, current price was inflated by McAfee.

I stopped being a n00b a long time ago.

1463 2018-01-01 21:40:20 In that sense Bitcoin is just as much a fantasy as other crypto currencies. A dream currency built upon the illusion of holding value.

1473 2018-01-01 21:39:26 Some advice for the new $crypto traders.

Scared by the drop in $USD price for BTC?  No worries!  Just invest into an $alt coin that has good potential (using /btc ratio).  Turn that 1 BTC into 5!  Then, when prices come back around (even if its a year from now), you're ahead!

1566 2018-01-01 21:32:13 I got you man, I’m going to be covering a lot of crypto stuff this coming year. Like how to everything with full on tutorials and such.
1567 2018-01-01 21:32:09 Why hold Verge? For me, the prior reason is fundamentally technical and never only for profit. Verge offers the best conditions for a long, prosperous life in Crypto world. A tip would  be welcome as a stimulus for what i'm already doing for a while. I'm ALL in this revolution!!
1568 2018-01-01 21:32:09 Again, price per coin does not mean anything if you don't take coin supply into account...
1569 2018-01-01 21:32:05 thats true, I hope the wraith protocol will release now like they said in 9.jan...
1570 2018-01-01 21:32:04 abi lütfen ön yargıyla yaklaşmayalım herkese lütfen tanımadan böyle bi yorumda bulunmayalım şüphe söz konusuysa zaten hiç verme adam paylaştıklarının zekatını istese on katı yapar toplanan paranın lütfen crypto yuvamız rookie başkanımız :)))
1571 2018-01-01 21:31:54 NOT ALL OF TRANSACTIONS BY VERGE ARE HIDDEN, ONLY THOSE WHICH ARE CHOOSED TO BE HIDDEN (CHANGED IP)
1572 2018-01-01 21:31:53 You have a lot vested in xvg. Can you say that minus the financial risk you have biased towards?
1573 2018-01-01 21:31:46 1819AYHCwzYYCzX9TkxLZR8nGdXWRRETmp
1574 2018-01-01 21:31:25 Fairly new to crypto but xvg was one of my first 5 purchases, and not just for wraith protocol. It stands to be one of the most impressive coins still. Hodl!
1575 2018-01-01 21:31:22 Bitcoin Cash jamais et ripple c’est de la merde, je vais à ma banque si je veux investir dans l’institution. 
J’avais acheté 1000 xrp et j’attendais juste un pump pour tout revendre

1581 2018-01-01 21:30:41 Concerned about the emergence of McAfee in the Cryptocurrency world. Despite no criminal charges sticking the guy has some real clouds hanging over him. Crypto is nascent, new, and seeking to find itself. We need to be careful who we put forward as it's face.
1582 2018-01-01 21:30:39 $XVG on the move.  Jogging before the sprint
1583 2018-01-01 21:30:39 Damn I'm trying to film my first video for my crypto YouTube channel but is having so much problems. 
1584 2018-01-01 21:30:37 There are so many crypto innovations, the fly the rest of the way.
1585 2018-01-01 21:30:22 That's because IOTA is displayed as MIOTA on CMC, the calculation is accurate...
1586 2018-01-01 21:30:12 Would love to get some more #XVG I still believe in rocket start #Wraithprotocol #VergeFamily 
1587 2018-01-01 21:29:53 If you held your Nxt in a nxt wallet you can now trade your Ignis directly for ardr using the ardr wallet. Last I checked it was about 2 Ignis for 1 ardr. No idea if that’s a good price or not...
1588 2018-01-01 21:29:36 Patience is the key to winning this game.
1589 2018-01-01 21:29:24 After staying up until about 3AM last night I think I won’t be buying any $XVG for a while lol.  Nothing against the project but I’m just not a huge fan of the marketing around this coin.
1590 2018-01-01 21:29:23 Nice! Charting raw is the best. I sometimes print out charts and draw trendlines with crayons like a real OG 
1591 2018-01-01 21:29:22 Happy New Years everybody, 2018 is going to be huge for #Crypto and I'm excited to be a part of this movement. Many projects going live this year and I'm fully expecting to see a continuation of blockchain adoption globally. See you all at the !
1592 2018-01-01 21:29:18 While price is good we need to focus on the goal of creating a fully viable market using crypto.
1593 2018-01-01 21:29:16 2018 is the year of the #crypto we shall thrive this year and reach new heights!

1616 2018-01-01 21:27:58 Why does that even matter? This is so asinine.

1622 2018-01-01 21:27:37 $XVG support level is at 1200 Satoshi. From this point it is slowly increasing again. #VergeFam is strong, let's reach the 1500 Satoshi again - @TheVergeLion #Verge #XVG #Vergecurrency #VergeCoin #Vergenews #Crypto #altcoins #altcoin #vergearmy #cryptonews
1623 2018-01-01 21:27:31 Thanks. This was the morning after, so several hours after alcohol.
1624 2018-01-01 21:27:29 Sorry but $XVG about to have one of the biggest gains in crypto history.   
1625 2018-01-01 21:27:22 Given they have very little info out there. Once they raise awareness and the product is qualified. Then there will be profits to be made
1626 2018-01-01 21:27:20 What we $SX could be bringing to the market through Wei -Tek could dwarf in value what all other BC - Crypto companies on the Venture and CSE have presented if you put them all together .

1640 2018-01-01 21:25:50 looks like #XVG is in a breakout, though I can't see it avoiding a plunge to .00000995 for long #crypto
1641 2018-01-01 21:25:45 These are my personal opinions and not formal advice. Unfortunately it is the only place you can buy them with mixed reviews online. I'm not saying this is a solid investment either but more trying to raise awareness for good return given its low price and market cap.
1642 2018-01-01 21:25:38 There’s only one crypto out there making wraith possible. 16c is a steal and it will be fully ready soon.

1644 2018-01-01 21:25:20 Worst #crypto decision of 2017: $MGO ICO on $WAVES chain. Terrible liquidity, thin order books. Still waiting on widely-touted 'swap tokens between WAVES/ETH chains'. Can't transfer to #Cryptopia to sell. Apparently, hodl forever.

1646 2018-01-01 21:25:02 Keep at it. Too much negativity can only thrive for so long. Be positive in your outlook and develop a damn good product. Your body of work will speak for itself. Privacy in crypto will change the world if you really believe in your vision as described in your videos. Godbless.
1647 2018-01-01 21:24:48 My #crypto portfolio increased more than 500% from my original investment in 2017 alone and yet trolls still use my gender as an insult when I have an opinion on altcoins they never even heard of. #btc #eth 
1648 2018-01-01 21:24:46 2. So in the mean time I believe as governments start a real war on crypto, the privacy coins is one attack vector that maybe more safe than a lot of coins, including BTC right now.  Eventually, BTC will adopt more stringent privacy layers but it's not available yet.

1650 2018-01-01 21:24:38 Yes, that was a horribly worded tweet from me while having a hangover... What I meant was it's not a decentralized blockchain, it has no miners, and unlimited creation of tokens. The crypto part of XRP isn't there to protect the token investors.
1651 2018-01-01 21:24:38 ben bir kez girdim bu gruplara, adamların nereli olduğunu bile bilmiyordum.. faydasını pek görmedim, bir daha da katılmam ama yeni başlayanlar bunu kendileri deneyimlemeli bence. bi de kendine güvenen herkes paralı grup kurabilir, güzel ekmek kapısı..

1667 2018-01-01 21:23:11 A couple coins I suggested when $BTC had its big dip from 27k a couple weeks ago was $VEN / $VET and #ICX. Doing well today for those who did their research on them. #Crypto

1680 2018-01-01 21:22:31 Although, in the United States Crypto is a capital gains, in time we need to realize its purpose, in the most altruistic, high-level model; is not to become a commodity but a means of exchange.
1681 2018-01-01 21:22:27 With 14 Billion Coins roughly in circulation for every Dollar in Coin Price every 25 cents equals $3.5 Billion in market cap.. WRAITH needs to be able to solve Problems in a way, and at a cost that makes it a Compelling and MUST HAVE Crypto Currency!!  #HopefulInVergeLand

1684 2018-01-01 21:22:17 I think 2018 is definately the year of the whole BTC / Alt ying yang swings not happening much anymore. Too many alts can stand by themselves and not be subject to BTC price or just alts in general.
1685 2018-01-01 21:22:05 Hey Jeremy, stop fuding, just sit back and relax. Such talking gives nobody to benefit with. The price will definitely will not skyrocket when messages like yours will be posted.
I bought at a bit lower price than you, also benefited from $XVG and would like to benefit more... 
1686 2018-01-01 21:22:04 There is a public website where you can look up IP's of tor node ip addresses. You can compare the addresses to the ones listed in said link. None of these IPs are tor nodes. Or even easier: make a transaction and after completed, see if your IP appears in said website.
1687 2018-01-01 21:21:54 Hey in crypto u need a place 4 peace hahaha
1688 2018-01-01 21:21:51 It would be awesome to learn more about how you take all of your profit from the Altcoins and cash out without having to buy back into bitcoin where you will most likely lose a lot of your profit during transfer or exchange

1700 2018-01-01 21:21:14 Guess we'll find out.
Pol would know a lot more than I know, which comes from casual perusal of the crypto Kitty website.

1702 2018-01-01 21:20:49 The team will work with exchanges. But no news yet.

1725 2018-01-01 21:19:07 @ToneVays watching Magic Money, it’s wonderful to see you come from the banking world like me. Gives me hope that I can one day be free and break away like you did. #BTC #crypto

1728 2018-01-01 21:18:55 The "Whale" is a wannabe "Wolf of Crypto"... lol..... I don't get why anyone listens to that dude and others like McAfee... They're trying to collectively manipulate us all... If people do their own individual homework, what's the purpose of them?
1729 2018-01-01 21:18:55 Women are often cautious, and that is good. In terms of crypto currency, it is easy to find negativity.  I think this article is baloney. As with any expenditure of funds....if you can't afford to lose it......
Don't do it!
1730 2018-01-01 21:18:45 Today’s crypto lesson: DIVERSIFY! I had a sleepless night with the #WraithProtocol fiasco.Though I was pretty upset to see the price drop this morning, I am still #HODLing most of my #XVG.  This year is about investing in ground breaking projects, which I believe $XVG is.

1743 2018-01-01 21:17:16 Who me? I bought at 4c mate, not a bad show really. This turnip you are backing up is talking shit though. Do your own research.
1744 2018-01-01 21:17:15 I've bought into #xlm #tron #xrp. 3 1/2 weeks into it and a little late to the game but in the game now at least.  Did most of you buy in when the were fractions of cost/pennies?
1745 2018-01-01 21:17:14 the difference between crypto currency inflation (which includes possibility of unlimited forks, altcoins, and changeable maximum issue amounts) and fiat inflation is that the free market finds the balance with the former, whereas fiat inflation is a forced issuance. 1/

1752 2018-01-01 21:16:43 @StephenPKendal is rarely wrong about his projections. He called #Steem at $2.80 USD exactly right. He then called a year end projection of $4.70 for Steem. Well, it may be ONE day late, but it looks like we're about to see that prediction come true!

1785 2018-01-01 21:15:13 And those solutions need to be developed BEFORE crippling the network, not after.  LN is also going to centralize transactions into banking hubs.  Solve the problem properly first before forcing fee escalation.

1828 2018-01-01 21:11:00 Lots of people are talking about regulation. Crypto is probably unstoppable at this point.

The best things governments could do to have some oversight is to start mining.

Fees are basically a tax and miners decide on who gets on a block.

Seems obvious.

1834 2018-01-01 21:10:35 You need to more $XLM!
1835 2018-01-01 21:10:27 Lol I’m just invested xrp, XLM and litecoin heavily at moment and other stuff bits and bobs
1836 2018-01-01 21:09:57 Actually, they claim that you have the IP obfuscated on the public and on the private ledger. Actually, they still have no private ledger by now.

1839 2018-01-01 21:09:34 Are we all taking notice of how big the crypto currency phenomenon is? 
1840 2018-01-01 21:09:32 Check out #HTMLCOIN up to 10 satoshi from 1 last week #justsaying
1841 2018-01-01 21:09:30 Die slow
1842 2018-01-01 21:09:29 Dude, many of us are here just because of the tech. It is the closest I've seen to satoshis original vision. End all corruption and wars, free the people! #verge is open source, private and public! It is the tool which will free us from debt, wars and misery.
$XVG is the next BTC
1843 2018-01-01 21:09:20 $DRGN being on @kucoincom is like a gift from the crypto gods!
1844 2018-01-01 21:09:14 Your english ain't so great bro, do you speak another language too? I said normies DON'T buy crypto, and I already won the bet on the watch, you have no car you take cabs, remember. But if you truly cashed out of BTC at 6200 after buying at $10, what did you do with all your BCH?
1845 2018-01-01 21:09:13 I've been trying to get word out on it the last few months, to the extent that my official codename is apparently "The Botnet That Walks Like a Man."

That, & pouncing on agents in back alleys & rasping, "The crypto'll eat yer *soul,* boy."


1846 2018-01-01 21:09:08 What will be the best crypto of 2018?
1847 2018-01-01 21:09:01 if u can help me and the community by doing a video that will be fantastic.. coz colx support sadly needs alot of improvement.. not much materials on YT
1848 2018-01-01 21:09:01 You should have posted this today for tomorrow the 2nd and you may have had a chance. Prob hit .25 today then jet up tomorrow afternoon.
1849 2018-01-01 21:09:00 Joined twitter back in March to learn more about crypto and I now feel that I can maybe offer something back.
1850 2018-01-01 21:08:59 Personally Yh
1851 2018-01-01 21:08:55 That chad is underperforming badly tho
1852 2018-01-01 21:08:55 こんなに急激にbitcoinが暴騰すると，売り買いしないでじっと持っておくのが無難。
1853 2018-01-01 21:08:52 @crypto_beak and @Altcoinbuzzio
1854 2018-01-01 21:08:49 What happened? I turn on Twitter to find insane amount of notifications and a few new followers. We should definitely help eachother out. For 2018 I’m big into crypto & blockchain and would love to connect to #vanynernation that is in this industry. 
1855 2018-01-01 21:08:47 Crypto valuta en crowdfunding maken banken iets van het verleden.
1856 2018-01-01 21:08:44 nice article for the #crypto community. A recommended read. $btc $eth #blockchain
1857 2018-01-01 21:08:30 Yh why not
1858 2018-01-01 21:08:28 New to crypto brought 5k in coin of NXT at 0.08 sold at 0.29, 
1859 2018-01-01 21:08:25 We are people who believe in the currency. I'm sorry that you hate us. Remember that there will always be people trying to bring others down. We are on twitter after all.
1860 2018-01-01 21:08:15 Well...one tell..there are limits on the number of these coins..I can tell you I have many buddies who are fund managers..who are getting a lot of calls from clients who want a trading connection or an in...there is high demand  these crypto brokers can't keep up with the volume
1861 2018-01-01 21:08:07 yeah, ok but that does not proof anything. how you know he used a wraith 4.0 stealth address?
1862 2018-01-01 21:07:52 In 2018 I will:

-learn Spanish
-get jacked
-make $100,000 on crypto trading
-top in space
1863 2018-01-01 21:07:51 I want to set it up on vultr VPS ( or any VPS) .. I got confused. Coz it's asking for ssh ..etc and the clox guide it mentioned Linus as OS, does that mean the its for Linus only. and so on.
1864 2018-01-01 21:07:44 Coinbase is a VC backed company. Their goal is to make money. They are not a charity. XRP is the 2nd largest crypto by market cap, with some of the highest volumes.
So what is this thread about? Yes, XRP will end up on coinbase, whether this video is fake or not. timing unclear.
1865 2018-01-01 21:07:42 Sounds like a plan, I'm in
1866 2018-01-01 21:07:35 It's important to understand that the banks own the media and they are trying to using all outlets to subdue Crypto before paying Politicans to act.
1867 2018-01-01 21:07:21 Forget about the stocks. It was all the unrealized wealth that suddenly wasn't going to be realized. Same thing now. Most crypto buyers aren't HODLers and don't actually think it's "real." A crash is when they all head for the exits.
1868 2018-01-01 21:07:02 I will be tweeting out my top 10 small and medium cap crypto picks for Q1 2018 shortly. $BTC $ETH $XRP $XVG $LTC $XLM $NEO $STRAT $BCH $XLM

1870 2018-01-01 21:06:51 Also in december 2017 it was easy to make 100% on your #crypto invest. $XVG was and is still the most exciting #coin and keeps you sharp , if you are a daytrader . I am just #HODLING because i believe in the technology.
1871 2018-01-01 21:06:49 Monkey on action. Awesome
1872 2018-01-01 21:06:41 @StephenBaldwin7 Have 20 minutes to come on our show and chat about crypto currency? Let's have some fun! #Dash

1875 2018-01-01 21:06:34 good man, happy to hear
1876 2018-01-01 21:06:32 and ARK is going down as FAK! nice.
I lost 10$ already WTF!?!?!?!?!!?
1877 2018-01-01 21:06:27 Simon Dear )))) #wraith works way different... by default its not hidden, but if you want to hide, just generate new stealth address in soft and use it to hide the IP )) #XVG coin can operate in both scenarios! so link shows people who trade without stealth mode!!! #STOPFUD

1880 2018-01-01 21:06:21 I wish that helps Bitcoin...this is war between Big money and the hard earned small money...in the past big money has won, always destroying the small guy.
1881 2018-01-01 21:05:58 OMG WOW SINCE SEPTEMBER?! THAT LONG!?
1882 2018-01-01 21:05:56 Do they have any form of capital gains tax that applies to anything you buy then sell for more? Thats what it is here not specificly crypto
1883 2018-01-01 21:05:55 Yeah I'm starting to like these new exchanges. It was just Trex and Polo for soooooooooo long

1886 2018-01-01 21:05:44 I guess there is so many ways to Play the Crypto Game... the Folks I mentioned earlier are some of the BEST..  Twitter is a Big World, so I know I left some out like @cryptowilson, who to me is on @crypto_rand and @cryptomocho 's level...   Follow these guys close and they ROCK!!
1887 2018-01-01 21:05:24 Followed your advice a few days ago, I knew this was coming!
1888 2018-01-01 21:05:22 correct, it's why i love you noobs from penny stocks and why i bought 1% last year for $2000. That's $23M today thx! Shit even Feb you could buy that much. Next one for you is $LDOGE. Buy that! it's sub-satoshi. You'd love it since you only care about $ & low coin price not value
1889 2018-01-01 21:05:16 Bobby, Your show is good and I enjoy it for the most part.  I would like to see more interviews.  I know it is not that easy to do in NYC vice SF, but I am sure there are still some interesting people around.  Maybe some people from your meet up group.

1892 2018-01-01 21:05:01 HODLers mean nothing. To take down the state you have to be able to buy everyday items with it. Until I can get my paycheck in crypto and live off it the banks will continue. We don't need a digital gold we need a digital cash. You HODLers don't help.

1901 2018-01-01 21:04:08 If Ripple sustains its value over the coming years it will probably just mean that people prefer transparent, simple monetary policies over the secretive, complex policies that exist today with fiat. Ripple popularity doesn't necessarily mean crypto is a bubble.

1908 2018-01-01 21:03:55 Here is a dilemma if you can only hodl one crypto which one out of these three? ReddCoin, DigiByte or UTrust?
1909 2018-01-01 21:03:14 What's even better you're quite happy to shit on someone that has previously supported your project and has mined and held your coin since atleast September. You're a disgusting Dev, you should be ashamed
1910 2018-01-01 21:03:14 I agree completely. I also appreciate that whale that's keeping the price down. Allows me to accumulate more as I decrease my other holdings.
1911 2018-01-01 21:03:00 Much needed in the crypto ecosystem. Can’t wait to see what you come up with.

1913 2018-01-01 21:02:44 @ING_Aust - Just wondering if you also are blocking / planning to block money transfers to #crypto exchanges, like the big 4. If not, I think you are about to get a huge influx of new customers. Thanks. #CryptoCurrency @BitcoinBabeAU
1914 2018-01-01 21:02:33 A BTC a month and I can live a modest lifestyle
1915 2018-01-01 21:02:32 It's a pretty special oppertunity to make money AND build a better world at the same time. Why waste it? There are tons of trades in crypto that will give you the same returns.
1916 2018-01-01 21:02:22 Because the crypto market hasn't exhausted all the fools yet...
1917 2018-01-01 21:02:17 I get why people are against XRP, But I fear that the general population may need a coin like XRP to ease them into Crypto. It may be a necessary coin to bridge what has been to what will be. That being said, who predicts another pump and who thinks we've already seen its ATH??
1918 2018-01-01 21:02:17 I'm not talking about the project. I'm talking about the meteoric rise of the value of the coin itself. That rise was not healthy and was/is unsustainable.
1919 2018-01-01 21:02:17 @findercomau is there any reason why you dont have BTC markets on your crypto review pages???
1920 2018-01-01 21:02:09 A friend of mine was describing to me what the world would be like when deflationary crypto replaced fiat entirely. He didn't realize he was describing the death of capitalism! Which was very much NOT his aim.
1921 2018-01-01 21:01:42 全然そんなわけないですよwww
LSKはどうしてもBTCの影響受けやすいので、他に伸びそうな銘柄あるならタイミング合った時のイナゴでもいいのかなと。

1922 2018-01-01 21:01:27 90% of the global population = mostly socialists (ZERO knowledge about economics).

90% of the crypto-investors = mostly WRONG every time, every day.

Funny af.
1923 2018-01-01 21:01:20 And what if just 4% of accounts owned 95% of all the coins? Because that's exactly what Bitcoin has.

How very decentralized!
1924 2018-01-01 21:01:17 You post trading signals for this coin on dec 20, are the targets still active?

1926 2018-01-01 21:01:13 I bought a condo in 2014. Best move I've made, outside of crypto investing. That said, I'm not watching the real estate market as much lately, but I think when the opportunity presents itself, being a homeowner is worth while.

Also, buy silver. lol.

1931 2018-01-01 21:00:13 Yep! As a poker player losing is a massive part of the game. I took up crypto trading and can adapt that mentality to this space as well. Solid advice and gave you a follow. Looking forward to crushing 2018.

1939 2018-01-01 20:59:36 For example, the market cap of IOTA is not $3-$4x2.7 trillion coins. Obviously. Coin price is not the same thing as (nor is it necessarily an indicator of) market cap, genius.
1940 2018-01-01 20:59:33 @Ethos_io will fix this... Get ready for the universal wallet. Launch will be in Q1 2018 followed by the fiat gateway in Q2 2018. 
And it will become even better with a complete new (people powered) financial eco-system (crypto and traditional assests)

1944 2018-01-01 20:59:19 Absolutely, I have seen these dumps happening so many times. The surprising part is so many are unaware of it and most are in denial about it. BTC community is not even aware
1945 2018-01-01 20:59:08 @officialmcafee you are bad for crypto ! Leave us alone please ...
1946 2018-01-01 20:58:57 Hopefully @BithumbOfficial
1947 2018-01-01 20:58:56 I would be interested in contributing a large sum to the PRE-ICO phase. Please advise if it would be possible!
1948 2018-01-01 20:58:52 It's not even difficult stuff. They should clearly distance themselves from @XVGWhale (a truly farcical contribution) & just get basic comms out to clear things up. This includes fronting up to the mess of the launch & providing clarity over how things will change in the future.
1949 2018-01-01 20:58:51 This was a FUD check a RT from @justinvendetta I'm considering leaving my position soon if it goes below 15 cents. Both FUDs and FOMO are currently blurring the lines between them. I see long term potential but unfortunately I got bills to pay.
1950 2018-01-01 20:58:46 That's the goal. Missed XRB. Must've been caught up with $DRGN and the $BTC madness in early December. Still should've caught this one in November. Need to go back to the drawing board.
1951 2018-01-01 20:58:43 Yea I like $bwk too, hope you’re right! Can’t foresee the notsofast comment coming either
1952 2018-01-01 20:58:27 snagged a little $ELF today...liking the volume right now.  Price....not so much LOL
1953 2018-01-01 20:58:25 @bgarlinghouse. Has your team considered tapping the crypto market for payment transactions? Everyone would win with direct payment access from each fiat to each Cryptocurrency/token. It would be inexpensive, fast, less trading mess and ultimately a better experience! Thoughts?
1954 2018-01-01 20:58:24 No offense what so ever, but do a lttle bit of research before you talk outta your ass lmao XRP isnt  the average crypto currency it was designed to speed up bank to bank transactions this isnt a currency for us it for the banks lol take advantage of it now
1955 2018-01-01 20:58:23 where do you fail ? i spent like 1 hour today trying to do it via the guide, can be improved indeed, but finally i managed to run it
1956 2018-01-01 20:58:18 Yes please 
1957 2018-01-01 20:58:12 You can speculate on other crypto, but eventually everything is consumed by the sun.
1958 2018-01-01 20:58:07 Actually, that is also not taking into effect that the value of the COLLECTED crypto going up. That is only if the price remains even. If it goes up like all crypto has the past year, the #GAINZ become exponential.
1959 2018-01-01 20:57:52 $UNIFY is going to the moon  watch it going like a real !

1963 2018-01-01 20:57:33 Apple app store probably wont have it
1964 2018-01-01 20:57:24 It is not one developer to start of with. It is a community. Obviously, you have not been following builds nor GitHub. I am on the other coins you mentioned for the same reason I am in XVG for the long term and believe in their tech. Different segments though. GL
1965 2018-01-01 20:57:23 Will the petro crypto be available to purchase? Any white paper on the release?
1966 2018-01-01 20:57:22 If one uses common sense: ppl complaining are the ones crying WHY MY $0.20 COIN NOT WORTH $1 TODAY?!? Clearly I am speaking price per coin (an indication of risk/market sentiment) rather than "market cap"(a dubious #; the calculation of which varies considerably between sources).
1967 2018-01-01 20:57:12 Ripple $XRP will skyrocket this week. 
Tomorrow Ripple will start to grow, because a lot of people will switch to Ripple.

1972 2018-01-01 20:56:07 I anticipate exchanges will become a lot more like traditional brokerages this year, issuing 1099s that will add up your capital gains taxes. Huge headache for big exchanges that want to be compliant, but not that big of a deal for the average crypto trader $BTC $ETH $XRP $XVG
1973 2018-01-01 20:56:07 All the @XVGWhale hates should stop following him instead of telling him to shut up..lol..including me..
1974 2018-01-01 20:56:06 Yeah, I'm probably going to get started on this crypto.

I'll try to be as helpful as I can.

But I'm not an expert, always do your own research.

1990 2018-01-01 20:53:54 The new GOP tax bill added the word 'real' in front of property, effectively closing the like-kind exchange loophole that existed for trading crypto.

2005 2018-01-01 20:52:36 My $Crypto New Year's Resolutions.

1) Keep 30% of all early investments as moon bags.

2) Never make a play out of fomo/FUD.

3) Stick to a plan, let a stop loss be a stop loss & let winners ride.

4) Never stop giving back to friends and followers.

5) Hit $1 mil.
2006 2018-01-01 20:52:36 Idea: an app that translates all blockchain and crypto terminologies into a layman's English.
2007 2018-01-01 20:52:34 Welcome to crypto then. No crime at all. Since u are out of Verge Buy into ZCL, XRP, RDD, and ADA and just hold them. U will be fine. Happy New Year John.

2010 2018-01-01 20:52:32 Do you a favor and get into the whole crypto space. Then you will find your answer. But be cautious at first. Don’t risk too much before you understand the market. But if you start right now you will get there for the second half of the year.

2012 2018-01-01 20:52:14 La situazione è diversa. Il suo definirmi "fascista" mi ha fatto accendere una lampadina, ricordando un gruppo di invasati che a settembre ho incontrato sulla mia strada tramite una mia follower. Il loro intento è far sbroccare la gente per segnalarla e far chiudere i profili

2018 2018-01-01 20:51:51 For me xrp and XLM are both good I’m holding both ... my understanding is XLM is decentralised and xrp isn’t .. it has less coins in circulation and stellar system has to use XLM we’re ripple system can be used without xrp

2047 2018-01-01 20:49:35 In my sincere view, the Achilles heel for $XVG is the failure on the part of @vergecurrency in marketing communications or, if you like, managing investor expectations. It could be a pet ‘specimen’ for an MBA thesis #Crypto.
2048 2018-01-01 20:49:18 why do markets, especially during a bearish turn after a long term rally, still tend to respect past ( I mean like months old) resistance/support zones? #crypto #trading

2086 2018-01-01 20:44:44 2/ I think the difference between us Preston is that I'm in crypto specifically because of how often the enforcement of law is unethical, tyrannical, and murderous.  Using "legal ethics" as a starting point falls on deaf ears.  I care about ethics first.

2098 2018-01-01 20:43:39 #1337coin is holding up well & the volume has been steady for the past week or so. I hope @Cryptopia_NZ re-open the $BTC market for 1337 again soon. #crypto #staking #Alts #masternodes

2102 2018-01-01 20:43:17 #XVG #xvgwhale Okay guys listen, did @justinvendetta miss the deadline? Yes. Has the team communicated perfectly? No. But they've just done something no other crypto has ever done with transactions... given you a choice; the point of this entire movement, and they've done it.
2103 2018-01-01 20:43:15 Some % will and soon. Maybe not a whole BTC but they will. And then some % will add a lesser known Crypto too. Real people in these markets and hasn't even started yet.

2110 2018-01-01 20:42:34 But this is no one fault except YOU because everyone knows that Crypto is not regulated, no SEC rules, no feds, extremely volatile and brand new market. Any normal investor knows NOT to invest what u can not afford to lose. So u cant blame someone else for ur own decision.
2111 2018-01-01 20:42:34 This coin is a gem! Just wait until it’s on the radar of the general crypto public 
2112 2018-01-01 20:42:30 2018 is going to be huge for the crypto space.
2113 2018-01-01 20:42:29 Everyone's looking for the next $XRB now. I'm betting on a few...
2114 2018-01-01 20:42:29 Have a look at crypto bridge (@CryptoBridge). I can think of a few other ones too, built on BitShares
2115 2018-01-01 20:42:17 Lol for the ppl tryna jump on the crypto currency wave, ima tell y’all rn. Don’t invest in bitcoin

2124 2018-01-01 20:41:27 $XRB has 125x in 30 days. From 25M cap to 3.4B. A true Uni-Coin. How did this project go under the radar for so long? @raiblocks

2129 2018-01-01 20:41:02 Max. Explain to the common man like myself. If I buy BtC with USD then the seller gets USD. It isn't destroyed. Are you suggesting that foreigners are buying crypto without having their currency converted into USD? Or less demand for USD because yuan RMB is gaining traction

1. Drink more coffee
2. Learn more things
3. Aquire more #crypto

"more excercise" didn't make the list because who's got time for that?
2135 2018-01-01 20:40:40 i am and i wont coming back even if it rises to 100 dollars
2136 2018-01-01 20:40:37 sad part is pumps like these hurt that effort. Who wants to become part of a crypto community where a small handful of people control most of the assets? Any real growth and they can trickle sell down to the plebs who don't get an opportunity to profit from said community growth.
2137 2018-01-01 20:40:34 Quick update on XVG would highly appreciate. Thank you in advance!
2138 2018-01-01 20:40:19 Strong on $powr, $sc and $lend for the next few months @JamarMDickson #crypto

2149 2018-01-01 20:39:09 Supporting anything is a bias and that is totally fine in life IMO.  But in trading it is a different story.
2150 2018-01-01 20:39:08 Trading #crypto is like downloading mp3s pre-Napster
2151 2018-01-01 20:39:04 「また安定して来たし，大きく下がったので，次の上がったときにショート(コインを高く売って安く買い戻す)で勝負するか」と思うと痛い目に2度遭った。目減りしてしまったbitcoinを取り戻したい。しかしあの暴騰の恐怖を思い出すと躊躇します。
2152 2018-01-01 20:39:03 it does not meet the requirements, end of story.  xrp is a centralized scam coin.  the company owns 60% of them lol
2153 2018-01-01 20:39:01 @MichaelPascoe01 Had the misfortune to read your melodramatic hit piece on BTC the other day. I was embarrassed for you and The Age reading that ill-informed drivel. Still don't get crypto old man? Sit down and let the world progress.
2154 2018-01-01 20:38:58 the thing is that is a really open source project, that means it get really wild sometimes... of course there is people that thinks all is about lambos then, haters, then fuders. Thats the beauty of this, no ceo, no centralized team.... YES THATS CRYPTO.
2155 2018-01-01 20:38:56 So you weren't supposed to trade crypto drunk last night? 
2156 2018-01-01 20:38:51 I can confirm aswell, just tested and posted :)
2157 2018-01-01 20:38:49 
2158 2018-01-01 20:38:44 Like what was said. A quick study of the code shows that the protocol does NOT obfuscate the ledger. Tor functionalities are there too, but they need to be run as a separate process. Too many components seem to be hard-coded and it appears as if the protocol was rushed.
2159 2018-01-01 20:38:41 Ummmm..... rather than state this, get the facts. I will ask for you.
2160 2018-01-01 20:38:28 People need to give this dude a break, I'm sure he didnt excpect this HUGE cryptocurrecey boom, he wasn't prepared to go from doing what he enjoys doing to having 50 million people on his back, but you can tell he's trying, dudes been awake like 3 days straight
2161 2018-01-01 20:38:23 4th in volume and you believe it is a scam. that volume should have driven it to zero by now. get a grip, people. Go to other Altcoins #xvg
2162 2018-01-01 20:38:06 Lo hai usato per ben due volte. Non so nella tua setta come siate abituati, ma i miei mi hanno insegnato che certe parole non si usano, specie in presenza di signore.
Visto che fai finta di NON arrivarci, inizia per "ca" e finisce per "zo": 5 lettere.
Ce la puoi fare
2163 2018-01-01 20:38:04 Il termine che mi infastidisce è hai sfracassato l'anima.
Ho messo l'accento giusto??
2164 2018-01-01 20:38:03 With all the blockchain shit we're doing, maybe we can FIND A WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE WITH THEIR CARBON OUTPUT VIA BLOCKCHAIN. Or maybe just slapping crypto on it will make people pay attention and invest.
2165 2018-01-01 20:38:02 It’s nothing new. It hasn’t recently “turned” into anything new. Been that way for centuries. Again, can we keep crypto and politics separate, ffs?
2166 2018-01-01 20:37:57 @ErikHansen93 He can also create great products and/or align his company with great partnerships to add real value to #tron instead of using the #bitcoin. @cornBling It's perfectly fine to be bullish if you see real value in what he's doing but a dog knockoff of crypto kitties?
2167 2018-01-01 20:37:45 I think POE has lots of potential, market cap is around 200 mil, total supply around 3 billion and circulating supply around 2 billion, so room to grow.
And they seem to have a good and open communication with a lot of followers adding to it everyday.

2172 2018-01-01 20:37:14 Made some changes in my portfolio today; enlarged my bag of #ITC and set some buy orders on #Neblio.

2173 2018-01-01 20:37:09 Crypto instaled US govt via Freemason protocols for the explicit purpise of creating a militarized state. POTUS= sup command.
2174 2018-01-01 20:36:56 time to get back to trading. will have a good look at the crypto's today and make some decisions
2175 2018-01-01 20:36:40 Could make a documentary about it. My life in crypto. Document it all. I would watch it

2185 2018-01-01 20:36:05 decentralization is the #1 reason why all the mom and pops I know dont trust crypto
2186 2018-01-01 20:35:53 I think 2018 will mean we have more crypto currencies than stocks.  I also think that limited supply argument makes no sense at all unless you only believe in one coin and one fork and that's like saying there is a limited supply of open source software.
2187 2018-01-01 20:35:53 Is #Crypto inherently about greed? Or is #altruism still alive on the #Blockchain? #moraldilemma #community #greed #technology

2193 2018-01-01 20:35:34 I am looking to make a significant investment into a crypto that currently has a Market Cap under $20 Million.

Thank You - ICO Tycoon
2194 2018-01-01 20:35:23 .@paulkrugman, who doesn't understand cryptocurrency, says "banks already have digital money." If Ripple was the only crypto that existed, he'd have a point. #btc #ltc #eth #crypto
2195 2018-01-01 20:35:10 Like this keep it up
2196 2018-01-01 20:35:04 What's this?
2197 2018-01-01 20:34:55 I am still a crypto & trading/chart noob - 2 years - trying not to to look is the hardest thing I have had to learn! :-)
2198 2018-01-01 20:34:44 Do you have a trust set up for them, with conditions that will need to be met in order to get access to the money at different stages?  Such as requiring a degree with a minor in finance as a generic example.  Handing kids millions of dollars is almost always a horrible idea. IMO
2199 2018-01-01 20:34:43 It’s not the crypto that has to grow up. It’s us, the first wave traders. Stop arguing about what’s the better coin for X or Y. Invest!

2211 2018-01-01 20:33:51 As it turns out, the latest code of Verge on Github is now out – and a quick study of the code shows that the protocol does NOT obfuscate the ledger. So that’s why the coin is going down. Because the claims were lies and everyone I wary of Verge.
2212 2018-01-01 20:33:45 Crypto so full of FUD, lies, and manipulation ! It’s a mess   smh
2213 2018-01-01 20:33:40 #ThingsNeverSaidIn2017 Bitcoin's performance has been disappointing. I should've sold all my crypto in 2016.
2214 2018-01-01 20:33:35 Yes, but there is at least one big technical issue arising from this interview: The coupling with bitcoin mining. It is not clear to me how this works technically. The other related big red flag is the 50% hash power they are talking about. This means centralization...
2215 2018-01-01 20:33:25 神はインターネットにいた
2216 2018-01-01 20:33:25 If you click on the wallet, you should see after encrypted it, an option called : "Unlock for minting" you just unlock it like this, and after at the bottom on the right, you should see the number of days to receive your first rewards
2217 2018-01-01 20:33:22 That’s what I do , I have my day job then on the weekends I do uber to also find the crypto life , easy extra 1000 a month to invest just from Uber on the weekends
2218 2018-01-01 20:33:11 I bet you just came into crypto thinking you know shit ... Verge will always stay a shitcoin, period!

2221 2018-01-01 20:33:06 Yeah, i'm still too afraid of ICO's , since tons of them just dip a lot after they get on exchanges. But my guess is that's its the best way too make some profit.
I'm not that long into crypto, taking babysteps :)
2222 2018-01-01 20:32:52 Wow !! You're the best Sir !!
2223 2018-01-01 20:32:36 Currently finding it hard find a balance between taking profit on projects I really believe in. Case in point $REQ and $XRB. Could've taken profit on both a week ago and missed out on big gains #trading #investing #crypto #cryptocurrency #BTC #eth #xrp

2247 2018-01-01 20:30:11 Info or advice on how to use wallets for alt coins that aren't supported by ledger nano s such as $ADA
2248 2018-01-01 20:30:07 I fear those who dive into crypto without understanding everything surrounding it are going to get taken advantage of, one way or another.

2252 2018-01-01 20:29:41 Io ho semplicemente espresso un parere come il tuo. E, secondo me, chi se ne esce in questo modo, è una persona poco intelligente.
Peraltro la differenza tra me e te è che io non sono andato sui profili altrui ad esprimere pareri non richiesti. Potevi farti i fatti tuoi

2256 2018-01-01 20:29:16 The #crypto space is infested with instant gratification so endemic in current society. Everyone wants their Lambo now and will just throw their money away on anything 
2257 2018-01-01 20:29:15 Do you have any crypto trading suggestions ? 
2258 2018-01-01 20:29:11 1. Early walk in the retiro to Palacio de Cristal

5. Hang out in Malasaña, drinks at "Corazón"
2259 2018-01-01 20:29:01 la pregunta del cripto es: quien "crea" la escasez de crypto para q llegue a ese monto?...conozco de gente "potencilamente multimillonaria, ahora, Ud canjearia sus $ (billete) por algo virtual? hay q tener valor ....

2266 2018-01-01 20:28:43 If this was a scam, the pump is done and it was the most I have seen in my trading history. Why would the developer keep going at it since past the date? Can't they just go and relax or run away now since it done with the hype and people. Use common sense.  #xvg

2287 2018-01-01 20:26:49 #ripple might be most hated coin in crypto world but that does not make the fact there is huge interest towards #xrp from people in financial industry. As an investor you should have minimum 200 bucks for $xrp
2288 2018-01-01 20:26:44 واياكم ،،
2289 2018-01-01 20:26:40 Truth is most people have no clue how much risk they are undertaking trading these crypto currencies
2290 2018-01-01 20:26:39 Crypto currencies have small downside, but potentially "sky is the limit" upside. Risk what You can afford to lose, don't mortgage Your homes and borrow money You may not have tomorrow. On the other hand, for some it could be no more 9-5. Take care.
2291 2018-01-01 20:26:30 He’s not trolling your just trying to make your followers believe in the coin now because you numbered yourself with telling them all to hodl

2316 2018-01-01 20:23:10 Don't let market cap confuse you when it comes to crypto. It's almost irrelevant

2323 2018-01-01 20:22:13 Aren't you bothered by his constant use of pre-scientific psychological ideas like Jung? Or how uniquely "inspired" or true the symbolism in Christianity is? He talks about crypto-Marxists running universities in terms that would make Alex Jones blush.

2325 2018-01-01 20:21:58 now you should check post which i retweeted from guy who tested the soft actually... to provide secure hidden transaction, you should generate the stealth adress in new 4.0 version soft
2326 2018-01-01 20:21:55 You'll have as much success making demands of decentralized crypto assets as you will making demands of gold. If you want to see progress happen faster, offer your contributions instead.

A new crypto currency employing excessive veneration or worship of the Virgin Mary.
2329 2018-01-01 20:21:52 What target do u have?
2330 2018-01-01 20:21:49 (3) Swift handles about $5T worth of wire transfers per day, a system dating back to the 70's. A crypto like Bitcoin will never be able to handle such volume, so another solution is needed. Enter XRP and Ripple.

2339 2018-01-01 20:21:31 The strength of the coin is in the usefulness of the tech. That's what will carry it forward long term. The pump may bring attention to the project, but its up to the individual to exercise his or her own common sense as to the validity of claims made by the pumpers.

2344 2018-01-01 20:21:14 You guys rock.  My initial research into IOHK and the researchers supporting your work absolutely transformed my perception of blockchain and crypto.  I am kicking myself for selling my $0.02ADA.  Back with a vengeance! Keep up the stellar work

2355 2018-01-01 20:20:11 I can understand buying and holding some crypto currency. Trading them? That I don’t understand. Why? Because in order to effectively trade an instrument you need it to have ample liquidity, longer term historical trading data and the ability to trade both long and short.
2356 2018-01-01 20:20:06 I gotta go back to my day job tomorrow.   Got everyone on my floor trading crypto during work hours and the company trying to put a stop to it. Lol. I’m a bad influence !!
2357 2018-01-01 20:20:05 You should do a coin of the day, it would be a really unique idea and totally not for your personal benefit
2358 2018-01-01 20:20:02 Shouldn't be a problem for the bulls, if it hasn't already crossed
2359 2018-01-01 20:19:57 This is true but we cannot deny the fact that many people(traders or investors)  are in for the profit !!! ;)

2362 2018-01-01 20:19:52 crypto love
2363 2018-01-01 20:19:51 I have been very worried with McAfee in this arena. He's shady, he's been involved with some off the wall stuff, and whether true or not his representing crypto is worrisome. I don't trust him.
2364 2018-01-01 20:19:50 Interesting thought. I agree that privacy was crypto's initial main attraction. However now it seems that FOMO has kicked in and its main attraction is recent gains in price. I suspect that (right now) it is a wealth transfer mechanism not unlike a Ponzi scheme. Future uncertain.
2365 2018-01-01 20:19:41 @Rulcryptotrader no ma
2366 2018-01-01 20:19:34 I reckon #xrp is ready for another bullish run as soon as folks are back after the new year break. Be interesting to see how things pan on across the crypto board over the coming weeks. I think the overall market is gonna grow rapidly this year! #ripple #crypto

2375 2018-01-01 20:18:41 Wraith has been proven over and over to be fake...... Do you not google or keep up with crypto at all?
2376 2018-01-01 20:18:41 ok created the stealth address, sent but transaction and addresses appear in the block explorer.. shouldn't have been hidden ? i sent to a public address though...it could be the receiver needs to be a stealth address aswell ?
2377 2018-01-01 20:18:35 thx birbo appreciate it ;)
enjoy
2378 2018-01-01 20:18:06 Hoping to enable businesses to use $CRYPTO / #Blockchain in the future. 
#goals
2379 2018-01-01 20:17:48 I think once #XVG becomes an intriguing buy for the casual crypto trader/investor, it's really going to take off. You gotta remember crypto is still too complicated for some people and to some extent "taboo".  People still like the concept of fiat in their hands..
2380 2018-01-01 20:17:41 Nice try though, you did an excellent job in making yourself look an idiot :)
2381 2018-01-01 20:17:34 After learning a bit about crypto in 2017 trying to do the same in 2018. Maybe even sharing some knowledge, experience, .. when useful :)
2382 2018-01-01 20:17:32 Started with $XRP and just got addicted to it. I like it a lot better than day trading, which I started in 2015. Easier to keep up with crypto news than everything under the sun lol
2383 2018-01-01 20:17:30 WELCOME 2018! The year of #CryptoCurrencies

2386 2018-01-01 20:17:19 @AlexChoOfficial Hi man ! Can u add me, I would like to talk with u you in DM about a important crypto project, on the pump if you know ! We have a pump group and we are looking to enlarge it, and you are a famous representant of cryptomoney on twitter ahah ! Thanks very much :)
2387 2018-01-01 20:17:17 Makes it so much more real when people share their mistakes. Thanks for sharing.
2388 2018-01-01 20:17:11 You speak for the entire market now ? You do realize us #crypto investors are still a major minority.   The Drama surrounding #XVG is worthy of its own TV series.
2389 2018-01-01 20:17:06 Right it’s all hype and everyone just lost a lot of money. I lost 1800$. I really had faith in this coin. I kept holding t even through the dumps. But it’s over :(
2390 2018-01-01 20:17:02 Degrees do open doors that networking cannot.  A very large percentage of high-earning careers require the degree to be considered...you can still invest in crypto once you land the job (and have more $$$ to invest)...easy logic
2391 2018-01-01 20:16:59 Hey, is this on Binance? Cannot see on Bittrex.
2392 2018-01-01 20:16:58 How did you lose that much on zencash? #hodl

2394 2018-01-01 20:16:53 only part I'd push back on-- it seems Square is venturing into Crypto Brokerage, so Dorsey isn't completely missing the mark on this
2395 2018-01-01 20:16:49 @hqtrivia chat stream is amazingly entertaining. The amount of crypto references to Trump/Maga babble is disheartening. 1:35

2400 2018-01-01 20:16:29 Coinbase supports 4 currencies which make up only 58% of the #crypto market cap. In order to reach 95% you would need to support at least 66 coins. #funfact @CryptoVaultCo

2412 2018-01-01 20:15:31 Dear Jaffer, can you make a screenshot. So we can spread the proof it works. Some heavyweight #XVG peepz stationed in Asia there. Spred the news to the #VergeFam #wraithprotocol
2413 2018-01-01 20:15:22 Going into 2018 with the following portfolio:
$AMZN - long term holding
$NVDA - still dominating
$JUNO - Favorite CAR-T stock after $KITE was bought
$BABA - My China play
$EOG - Oil coming back
$MGTI - My big gamble on Crypto and sleeper stock for 2018. 
Happy New Year!!

2426 2018-01-01 20:13:44 Development team missed their deadline on Wraith.  It came out this morning, but a lot of people lost confidence in the team.
2427 2018-01-01 20:13:42 Ahh. Crypto growing pains! Hopefully scaling does not become a big issue here like it has become with #Bitcoin. Extremely excited about #ARK but it will need to be able to handle regularly scheduled big delegate payouts in the future.
2428 2018-01-01 20:13:39 And I’ll forward it to you
2429 2018-01-01 20:13:33 For those of you at are interested in cryptocurrencies. I have put together a document with some of the investments I've made, along with some of the research I've done and learning videos. Also I have put instructions on how to purchase the coins. Send me your email address
2430 2018-01-01 20:13:30 A market is multiple parties involved in a transaction. That used to be exclusively in person. It is becoming less so. One of the issues crypto addresses is efficient global movement of funds without regard to borders. How could you possibly disagree with my previous statement?
2431 2018-01-01 20:13:30 Agree! Love the Happy Hours but appreciate that you keep the others short. You talk fast and are considerate of people’s time....and you play nice. I’m starting to see the mean side of greedy people (example, “delete girl”) and it takes the fun out of it. Keep the positivity 
2432 2018-01-01 20:13:29 Happy for you doge!!

2438 2018-01-01 20:13:14 Sold 25.000 #XVG. It can fall back under 1000 sats. #Verge $XVG #crypto
2439 2018-01-01 20:13:08 If fiat does crash and burn, will the change to crypto be quick? Or would crypto suffer from the crash too? I just don't see how it could be spared from a global crisis like that

2444 2018-01-01 20:12:13 Shouldn’t NEM be included in the list of crypto? More significant in 2017 than a few of the others. And bigger annual returns too - 2830% Hoping to see more NEM coverage from @Cointelegraph and @coindesk this year as it’s a real-life use-case Blockchain @Inside_NEM

2449 2018-01-01 20:11:49 You are simplifying a complicated mathematical equation that is the value of crypto currency to one single factor lol
2450 2018-01-01 20:11:36 Well, you're comming into Crypto just in time. Do alot of research, put your money where your mouth is and you'll be good. 2018 will be epic.
Good luck to you!

2482 2018-01-01 20:08:59 Comments from a brand new twitter account, talk about FUD troll fever LOL ok Johnyboy. Then just go to a crypto community u like and support them. Why u here?
2483 2018-01-01 20:08:55 bitcoin FXはロング(先に買い後で売る)で行う方が安全。多少高く買ってしまっても，待っていればもっと高く売れるのだから。逆に先に売ると，安く買い戻そうとしても相場がもうそのレベルに戻ってこない。大損する前に買い戻すこと。コインは減ったままだが，円での価値は取り戻せる。
2484 2018-01-01 20:08:53 Lmao exactly. People are really following these morons. On top of all they they are just copy and pasting tweets as fast as they can so it looks like they know what they’re talking about. It’s a joke

2513 2018-01-01 20:06:21 1st part-- you need to know which timeframes are realistic to you & your goals. Objective lifetime charts are scary/depressing but they also allow you to disconnect from overwhelming short term moves and watch #bitcoin's $crypto's steady, periodic parabolic ascent.
2514 2018-01-01 20:05:51 Crypto twitter is the new equivalent of the 90s when people were pumping penny stocks in forums and newsletters! Well the ugly part. Tons of information and a way to learn about ins and outs of the industry following developers, etc.

2517 2018-01-01 20:05:44 Time to start my crypto currency portfolio! Super excited to get into it.

2519 2018-01-01 20:05:03 So... over xmas I got into crypto investment. At first I saw it as just an interesting way to invest savings. But after a while, I realized there's some genuinely interesting work being done with the tech.
2520 2018-01-01 20:05:03 Tranquillo 
Grazie.
Io ho apprezzato te e le tue parole.
Ho avuto conferma che ormai siamo una squadra fortissimi 
2521 2018-01-01 20:04:57 I understand it's purpose and don't care about it. The coin goes completely against what a crypto is.
2522 2018-01-01 20:04:54 Anyhow great channel. I would deff recommend more interviews. Also more videos specifically describing new updates that are being added to diff platforms. A lot of us are interested in those things but it's not the easiest to understand how developers explain it sometimes lol.
2523 2018-01-01 20:04:54 Some of my crypto 2018 resolutions:

1. Record my 2017 L’s so I can improve 
2. Fine tune trade journal
3. Physical and mental health
4. Improve TA knowledge
5. Community networking 
6. Turn phone airplane mode more often

What are yours?

2527 2018-01-01 20:04:36 it will be interesting to see what happens with crypto this year  because it reminds me of the manipulation and insider trading that happened in the stock market before the securities and exchange commission came on the scene.   that really happened after alot was lost
2528 2018-01-01 20:04:35 Oke.I ll be patient.thx again buddy.

2534 2018-01-01 20:04:18 ICO tips!
2535 2018-01-01 20:04:11 Yep, it's the thing to do in crypto these days. Go live with a crap logo and website, then rebrand and launch new website and get a nice pump.
2536 2018-01-01 20:04:01 $colx too
2537 2018-01-01 20:03:47 Agreed. I’m 100% in on XVG, but debating whether to split 50/50 with TRX.
2538 2018-01-01 20:03:42 $REQ at 84 cents now. I called this one at 6 cents, and it's up from 62 cents when I mentioned it yesterday.

2546 2018-01-01 20:03:31 Thank you very much man! Best of luck to you! We have so many opportunities to make it happen in crypto this year ;)!
2547 2018-01-01 20:03:27 I have a liked a re tweeted a few times but never had a sniff of anything.. this will be the last. Tweet accounts with huge followers in Crypto world are quite valuable. ETH

2552 2018-01-01 20:03:15 8. Don't trust stupid tweets, people all have their motive. Do your research well 9. Don't keep adding money into it, if you can't grow original capital, you might lose more 10. Never panic sell, ever 11. If you are putting money in crypto, learn what is #blockchain for gods sake
2553 2018-01-01 20:03:11 Start your streams earlier, so I can watch them in germany :D
2554 2018-01-01 20:03:10 Actually, 2018 should be the year of ufos, cannabis, and crypto
2555 2018-01-01 20:03:06 Just started investing in crypto and have doubled my initial investment in a little over 3 weeks thanks to the advice of people in @Valkyrae discord ....especially @eirikri . It's a fun rollercoaster of emotions
2556 2018-01-01 20:03:05 こちらこそありがとうございました！勉強になりました(^^)
2557 2018-01-01 20:03:04 whats your take on verge?   will the .70cent haejin prophecy be fulfilled still ?   after the fud/ last night
2558 2018-01-01 20:03:02 おつかれさまです！
次のキャスも楽しみにしてます！
2559 2018-01-01 20:02:54 just saw you have that too.
2560 2018-01-01 20:02:40 うんこしてましたｗ
2561 2018-01-01 20:02:40 Haejin is doing everyone a very solid favor by focusing so much attention to Bitshares and yet people continue to ask him about other coins that have no working product or as much potential as Bitshares.

2018 will be the year of the DEX and anything else that touches it.
2562 2018-01-01 20:02:38 Lets talk crypto! What's the next big thing? #Crypto #Whatsnext
2563 2018-01-01 20:02:32 Every dollar sold to buy crypto, whether for Bitcoin or an Alt, fulfills “Satoshi’s Vision” of dismantling central banking. While I prefer Bitcoin, I welcome any form of competition as long as it uses Proof-of-Work.
2564 2018-01-01 20:02:31 Oh, I didnt specify price range in that tweet - i did in another; apologies. Yeah, $PART is 1000x the price of xvg. I am happy with the returns on my $822 investment when #xvg was at $0.008... I'm in for the long hold.
2565 2018-01-01 20:02:25 People see their coins go up 10x in 3 days and expect the rest of the crypto world to keep pace with price appreciation. That's plain stupidity. No time for that,  GTFO. Development takes time and has physical, real world limitations.  Wish more people understood this.
2566 2018-01-01 20:02:15 Is it ok to log into a crypto exchange like Binance in Starbucks? #ETH #Ethereum
2567 2018-01-01 20:02:10 Make some compact substance dense videos. Maybe 1 min version of current videos. Not everyone has gone for 30 min stuff even if it good.
2568 2018-01-01 20:02:10 僕もです（多分売る）
2569 2018-01-01 20:01:57 I went out abit of the crypto in the past two weeks because of personal issues. Thats quiet some time in the crypto world :) but I know verge and icon seem really optimistic. Ive been told btc can fall a bit more so that's when I'll look in more to buy something
2570 2018-01-01 20:01:55 Your YouTube channel is the most relaxed, intelligent, and interesting channel in the crypto space.  Thank you so much for all you’ve taught me so far.  Keep up the excellence!!
2571 2018-01-01 20:01:53 Crypto
2572 2018-01-01 20:01:47 Whennnnn?? :))
2573 2018-01-01 20:01:44 hey ! Your channel is a very nice place to feel cozy in. You don't run only for the pump, you believe in your investment. But get a bit more technical for the sake of all of us!
2574 2018-01-01 20:01:42 I've done all I can to get a front-seat view of Crypto for 2018. Now I sit and wait. (hard part). 
2575 2018-01-01 20:01:40 Nice portfolio. XVG will be OK.
2576 2018-01-01 20:01:37 Syscoin has real potential $SYS and $XRB
2577 2018-01-01 20:01:36 Pivx???
2578 2018-01-01 20:01:26 On a brighter note... TRX is looking GOOD! I'm looking at charts right now and all I see is steady growth. It's only a matter of time it blows up!

2594 2018-01-01 20:00:34 Dude, I'm not trippn', I'm in this for the long-term. I think a lot of people lack patience, if their crypto doesn't go up the second they expect it to they start dumping it.... If you wanna make money in this game you need to be patient.

2603 2018-01-01 19:59:58 For crypto to become ubiquitous as a transactional currency, it will necessarily need to successfully address the stability issue questioned by Vitalik.

2605 2018-01-01 19:59:33 Being fined or put in prison for blatantly violating the law is less productive than dismantling the state indirectly by supporting the counter-economy with crypto-currency.
2606 2018-01-01 19:59:31 I'd likely need to interview TA experts, simply not my area of knowledge yet.. i do want to do this though, appreciate the advice
2607 2018-01-01 19:59:23 By end of January $1
2608 2018-01-01 19:59:18 Who is the lead dev of $PART? Its a rhetorical question: ask YOURSELF if u can answer that question without looking it up. Honestly, @justinvendetta has already - whether he likes it or not - created brand loyalty. If they can beef up their # of devs they'll improve quickly

2617 2018-01-01 19:58:43 It’s here - the present you imagined. But my feed is plagued by Crypto - I crave more. I will have to put more effort into choosing those I follow.
2618 2018-01-01 19:58:32 I agree. Although, Technical Analysis does allow a peak around the corner and in doing so, provides a probable future price pathway; and perhaps, the likeliest winner could display pattern which news and events could later justify (but never the reverse).

2627 2018-01-01 19:58:05 Not so sure Crypto tipped it - think the need for independent thoughts and news differentiated from main stream media

I.e. power ledger as an renewable energy coin, Qash/Lend coins in financial industry etc. block out 1 or 2 week per industry sector
2639 2018-01-01 19:57:27 In your 2018 $crypto trading/investing:
Step WAY back and look at the big picture: from today until [your life expectancy minus your age].
Challenge yourself to up the size of your moonbags past 10%.
Consider fiat as an at-risk position, like a PoS coin with negative stake rate.

2655 2018-01-01 19:56:13 @PatTheNESpunk just listened to your podcast where you talked about bitcoin. I think what you said is very true and I think you did the right thing being realistic about crypto currency. I have a college friend who mortgaged 45 acres of land to invest, and I’m afraid

I've no problem with $XRP and no problem with other alts or $BTC... I just don't like any maximalist... but too think that coinbase will miss a chance to make millions because of some crypto noobs politics... then you're so wrong

2663 2018-01-01 19:55:34 This is similar to how Email-Servers work.
If your Server IP has zero or bad reputation youre either not on the centralized white list or youre on some blacklist.
You can send as many emails you want, other email servers wont accept any of it.

This isnt #crypto at all.

2682 2018-01-01 19:53:44 The percent of people in developed countries that own crypto at all is still less than 3%, $600B market cap is negligible in the global economy. A crash in crypto would be a non-event. The Fed Reserve dumps $200B onto bond market each month.

2704 2018-01-01 19:51:27 ...or perhaps band together with other aussie crypto traders and create your own Aussie bank? But don't use it to trade bitcoin.... that would attract too much attention. No need to bother with that? As a bank you can just create money out of thin air and it's 100% legal! (2/2)
2705 2018-01-01 19:51:20 Guess this one didn't work out so well.... More so opposite of what was predicted

2714 2018-01-01 19:50:21 @Haejin_Crypto who charted it to a mid 2018 target of $5.50 2 months ago when it was $0.005. So glad I bagged some then. Since sold and have rebought for the next wave (for what it’s worth)
2715 2018-01-01 19:50:21 ご丁寧にありがとうございます
2716 2018-01-01 19:50:18 But crypto is not in bubble they said.
2717 2018-01-01 19:50:14 Great project.. Good work!
2718 2018-01-01 19:50:03 Tone is right about bitcoin being king. Alt coins are bets against bitcoin and most are absolute shit. Lol all the people trying to get tone to change his mind on that. Cardano looks like maybe the only other decent crypto even if its in early development stages.
2719 2018-01-01 19:49:55 acikcasi reaple aleyhine olan dusuncelere katilmiyorum ama crypto currency piyasasinin bankalara kaptirilmasindan hosnut olmuyorum. Bu piyasa bankalara hizmet eden bir araca donusmemelidir.
2720 2018-01-01 19:49:46 Yes we do my friend.  I do this, because I believe in the technology and I know this will be a huge part of the crypto world in the future.  I have not received any compensation nor do I look for any for promoting the coin.
2721 2018-01-01 19:49:42 Same tech as ethereum (they can always copy the code) and yet more principaled. Huge institutions should choose etc over eth,no?
2722 2018-01-01 19:49:41 This is a bank coin. Don't worry they will make sure it will go up in value.  They want it to rival bit coin . Also new people coming in to the crypto space are going to buy it because of the media and marketing XRP  is doing . They won't even know what it really does . So HODL!
2723 2018-01-01 19:49:37  oh man don’t get me started.  Those people NEED to get out of the house
2724 2018-01-01 19:49:28 You dont understand Crypto do you? For a 1000 Dollars he could've bought 1 Bitcoin at the beginning. Now buy Alts with that Bitcoin and try to trade up to 4 Bitcoins. Sell Alts for 4 Bitcoins, wait, boom 48000$ and already more than with his lazy strategy 
2725 2018-01-01 19:49:17 More
2726 2018-01-01 19:49:08 China can't manipulate Crypto like it did to USD.
2727 2018-01-01 19:49:06 Never seen real TA tbh. Just fundamental analysis of the project. That’s something anyone can and SHOULD do, and it’s not bad that you do it. Just TA would add a lot kore value to your channel.

2741 2018-01-01 19:47:10 I believe all crypto has a long way to go and will all get regulated. Too many popping up every month. When dust settles you don't want to be holding any of these IMO. Good for day trades only IMO

2744 2018-01-01 19:47:03 More special guests and improve the quality (questions/overlay) of those special streams. Maybe even open up to paid content/interviews to bring more variet content

Electrum Dark  - Whitepaper Release
2776 2018-01-01 19:43:37 It implies that everyone will value decentralization, which is not necessarily true. It may come a day when crypto will have mass adoption but the average buyer won't even care about decentralization.
2777 2018-01-01 19:43:36 Why not go from 1000 now and try another x10 until a million?
2778 2018-01-01 19:43:33 Crisis started in 2008. Everyone calls it coincidence...and will call CME-Bitcoin Dip coincidence. People like to live in denial...and that is fine. Time will answer all questions. I wish I am wrong.
2779 2018-01-01 19:43:28 Take a look on @CloakCoin !!!
2780 2018-01-01 19:43:25 Lmao it’s hilarious what people do online. All that time making a profile to be someone else .
2781 2018-01-01 19:43:11 Ripple is for the banks. Pretty much all of the rest of crypto is for the people. You're missing the Goddamn point if you support Ripple.
2782 2018-01-01 19:43:09 DO NOT bring a restricted mindset into the crypto universe! If that’s the case you might aswell look the other way and stick to fiat currency and the current inflated monetary system! #Decentralize #FcukTaxes #Fcuk1% #WealthRedistribution

2794 2018-01-01 19:42:24 Thanks for the tip! I'm new to the scene and looking for ideas like these with great upside potential. Is coinexchange the only place to buy these coins? If so, is it secure?
2795 2018-01-01 19:42:23 Occasional Special Guest(s) maybe? I love hearing from the horses mouth and if we were able to submit some questions, that would be cool too.
2796 2018-01-01 19:42:20 Theme your shows. Ie what are the most important attributes an ideal coin would have- mobile scale, utility, privacy; and maybe build he “perfect” imaginary, imaginary currency. Or riff on what currency might look like in 25yrs,50yrs,100yrs. Almost like mental exercises

(kickn in januari 31) Half of all profit 'll be used to buy back there own coins and give them to holders. Marketcap!

2801 2018-01-01 19:42:03 @crypto_sarah9 

Any news on #Wraith?
2802 2018-01-01 19:41:52 Yes but that’s the risk of jumping in and out unless you really know what your doing - you never know and just as easy you miss a sudden uptrend while selling too soon thinking it will bottom again below what you sell
2803 2018-01-01 19:41:50 Can anyone explain the connection of req and link?
2804 2018-01-01 19:41:47 Would love a bit more specific insights about the coins you like - maybe pick a coin during an ep and delve in to what specifically made you interested. Love your channel!
2805 2018-01-01 19:41:46 Yeah I think interviews with traders, investors, analysts, etc, would be really great
2806 2018-01-01 19:41:42 7 days??? So nothing was ready?
2807 2018-01-01 19:41:31 Please, it’s @ClassicIsComing NOT ETCiscoming @zouhdianas  - That account was the victim of a hostile takeover & is now used to Troll ETC & promote shitcoins like mooncoin - Please unfollow ETCisComing  David Hill is everything that’s wrong with crypto 
2808 2018-01-01 19:41:25 I would love to see a video on how to move coins to/from the ledger nano s.
2809 2018-01-01 19:41:22 Since I've been on #crypto I've never seen #BTC market dominance so low, as of right now is 37.5!!! 2018 is definitely the year of the #Altcoins :D

2810 2018-01-01 19:41:11 @D_karvin Hi I'm from Vietnam. Great to see a Srilankan girl who is interested in crypto like me. I've been to Sri Lanka 2 times. Nice to get i touch ;).
2811 2018-01-01 19:41:10 too much of a luddite for crypto unfortunately but your twitters does rock - Any chance of a block ?
2812 2018-01-01 19:41:06 I'd say more interviews, but nothing really to improve on. As you stated your not an expert or financial advisor so I like how you go about your channel. Keep up the good work!
2813 2018-01-01 19:41:06 You can make tips and tricks video the are no longer than 3/4 minutes to support your longer ones
2814 2018-01-01 19:40:57 Haha true my friend whatever works best for you but I appreciate the advice
2815 2018-01-01 19:40:55 Raiblocks XRB, the next ripple? your thoughts?

I didn't do anything to him. He was drunk. He called an employee her mother a whore because she didn't want to serve him more wine.
2818 2018-01-01 19:40:35 In better news, I'm up 90% in crypto
2819 2018-01-01 19:40:31 Thanks?

If you're so befuddled by how the Internet works, you should talk less crypto and spend more time offline.

2832 2018-01-01 19:38:33 We don’t trade crypto for clients. We advise clients. We trade stocks for clients.
2833 2018-01-01 19:38:14 I closed 2017 with $74k in employment wages and $168k in crypto assets. Clearing well over $200k and I started the year making 45k/yr. My 2018 is looking healthy and a lot of opportunity for growth. #cantcomplain
2834 2018-01-01 19:38:08 2018 I get a full year of crypto moves...w o w =D
2835 2018-01-01 19:37:58 they will all go when the market is able to replace them. and that will happen when crypto overtakes fiat currency.

2860 2018-01-01 19:35:44 This has been my HODL #crypto portfolio in 2017.
#BTC - 30 %

#XRP - 10 %
#XVG - 5 %
#ECA - 5 %
Im thinking about adding 2 more in 2018, what's your suggestion for me ? 
And whats YOUR portfolio, if you dont mind sharing ? Comment

2861 2018-01-01 19:35:41 Yeah, @crypto_design recommended it to me. Very satisfied with it, but still need to learn a lot about its features.

2865 2018-01-01 19:35:12 Project is working though, I’m in heavy profit with #xvg and will continue to hodl. What’s a delay? I am still hodling my ETN after a month delay on launch and still in profit there too. Patience is key with Crypto!

2867 2018-01-01 19:35:10 I'm generally curious about what's going on, not trying to create confrontation.
2868 2018-01-01 19:35:08 #nodebt sadly also equals no credit. No ability to buy a car, a home or a phone amongst many other things. The crypto space must adapt to this new void and its lack of human reliability modeled transactional capabilities.
2869 2018-01-01 19:35:06 They say the dollar lost 9% of its buying power....I'm willing to bet its really 15% but they say 9% so no one fomo's into crypto's lol
2870 2018-01-01 19:35:00 @_PIVX the #PIVX core devs have created some incredible advancements for privacy & usability already. Cannot wait to see the continued developments!

2876 2018-01-01 19:34:30 Wasn't IP obfuscation on their road map along with wraith? Wasn't Tor only baked into the core wallet earlier? Aren't the ongoing transactions from your source dating back way before that? Doesn't the source state he hasn't tried the new wallet?

2884 2018-01-01 19:33:29 LOG is the best way to look st an asset like $BTC.
2885 2018-01-01 19:33:23 It’s a beast  now
2886 2018-01-01 19:33:00 I feel for you. It's so hard to hold when there are dozens of other options moving UP! But every day it seems the market cap of crypto increases. If you can hold back your own FOMO #XVG will do good for you. But best of luck to you whether you buy or sell! 
2887 2018-01-01 19:32:53 What? You're a crypto investor? Lol nice, I too invested in XVG but I don't think Wraith is out for Windows

2891 2018-01-01 19:32:30 As #crypto rises here is the secret watch where the coins were  buy in low hang on watch it grow don’t quit till it hits ur target winner winner chicken dinner  don’t buy into hype strategize and keep your goals o_O

2893 2018-01-01 19:32:14 Or  they do understand how it works and are intentionally posting misleading or outright false info. Ignorance, although damaging to an opionion setters credibility , is infinitely more forgivable than malicious motivations. My opinion of many of crypto veterans has diminished.
2894 2018-01-01 19:32:11 Mainstream reporting on the ups and downs of #Bitcoin's price is the horse race reporting of #crypto.
2895 2018-01-01 19:32:11 I’m right there with you!
2896 2018-01-01 19:32:10 If it’s so amazing, no need to build hype, let the ‘product’ do the talking... don’t see this in other cryptos... slightly worrying imo

2898 2018-01-01 19:32:07 Ether is a crypto currency
2899 2018-01-01 19:31:57 My only regret is that I bought at $0.23 and HODL throughout if I could back I would still be a Verge Hodler just with 5k verge instead of 2.5k

2901 2018-01-01 19:31:56 Bitcoin has already failed at establishing a viable replacement for paper currency. At the culprit is Bitcoin as a commodity. Crypto currencies are supposed to decentralize banking and bring access to the bankless.
2902 2018-01-01 19:31:47 L'espressione di un parere così meschino, te lo potevi anche risparmiare. Alla fine non ti ha invitato a pranzo, visto che non ti piaceva. Ad esempio la foto di testata del tuo profilo fa cagare, ma non te lo vengo a dire perché è un social
2903 2018-01-01 19:31:43 $SALT permet d'avoir des fiat (virement bancaire), et repose sur un mécanisme de prêt avec crypto comme collatéral, l'idée est que avoir un prêt n'est pas, ne serait pas une plue-value....

2908 2018-01-01 19:30:24 Seen you guys chatting crypto over past week or so. Been in XLM for a couple of weeks now, and still have my XRP! OMG seen a climb recently too, but mostly in ETH. Will take a read of this, thanks!
2909 2018-01-01 19:30:23 #xvg was my entry in #crypto world. I am gonna hold it till its to the moon . I believe in #verge and the future of privacy coin is bright. Believe me m from the future to help you guys out.
2910 2018-01-01 19:30:21 Pretty telling he did not notice before releasing.
2911 2018-01-01 19:30:18 Oh really? Are you new to crypto? I’ve seen it over and over and over again. The whole buy the rumor and sell the news thing is real whether u like it or not that’s what happens.
2912 2018-01-01 19:30:17 @BittrexExchange when will the upgrading be completed to open up for new users again?
2913 2018-01-01 19:30:12 crypto selfies and harsh words for drama self promotion attention. Lacking fundamental understanding of the criticisms of a centrally controlled crypto currency gaining proponents.. no discussion just name calling
2914 2018-01-01 19:30:03 I am feeling very bullish on crypto.  2018 is going to be an interesting year with a lot of people making money and some going bust.
2915 2018-01-01 19:30:01 I love many projects, and find attacks suspect. but Hmmm.. im thinking some folks are feeling threatened by #xvg?  Always more to the story.   Ill be doing research to get to the bottum of it and see, is wraith the real deal??  Crypto space is king of #fakenews.
2916 2018-01-01 19:29:56 It's risky but  with Crypto you stand a better chance of increasing your investment. Better odds than lottery. There are no rules restricting your potential like day trading restriction in broader stock market. Checkout coinbase and coinamrket cap websites.
2917 2018-01-01 19:29:55 買うか迷ってましたw
今んとこ何に使われるとか分かります？？
2918 2018-01-01 19:29:53 In this new crypto world trying to break from the status quo, we keep going back to the same stagnant habits of broken hearted acceptance, comfort with normalcy and faith in shiny documents. This year is going to make and break many Exchanges, Alts and ICO expectations.
2919 2018-01-01 19:29:37 Do I have time?
2920 2018-01-01 19:29:36 I Can not think of a future contract more volatil than RBOB, Can you? if so which one would be?

please exclude Crypto, with such high margin requirement i find unwise to trade it.

2935 2018-01-01 19:28:29 Is price going down because of me? Cool, I'm proud, because I sold in good time and earned money.
2936 2018-01-01 19:28:21 But I thought I was getting laid for following . When bobs? When vagene?
2937 2018-01-01 19:28:17 Illegal? You make it seem like crypto is a regulated government industry...it’s open source so either believe the hype or do the research.
2938 2018-01-01 19:28:13 @IAmJaneDoeFilm (2) also are you guys worried that with crypto taking off these “ads” will only be found on sites on the dark web by using Tor or they aren’t ads at all and they just use Facebook or other social media sites to solicit individuals? That’s how it will adapt.

2950 2018-01-01 19:27:03 The more I research lightening network the more I hate it.

Lightning unnecessarily complicates the crypto-currency real-world use case as money.

Old ladies are NOT going to open a channel for $50, deposit $100 & then close a channel for another $50.

2953 2018-01-01 19:26:30 Yeah but the larger holdings of crypto are Asian markets (approx 50% I think, 25% US?) so imagine Asian market & govt. support is probably more key to the price for first half of 2018 until it’s more mainstream in UK & Europe. Most UK knowledge seems to be only Bitcoin
2954 2018-01-01 19:26:20 Article on wraith, source which the article is based on says in the first few sentences, 'This is clients not running Verge 4.0 (Wraith). I'm seeing people saying that Wraith doesn't work. I have not checked it out so I have no opinion on that. Just to be honest and to clarify.'

2959 2018-01-01 19:25:59 I held verge and hold Monero so am familiar with both. It seems like the party is over for verge. Kouvri should solve the IP issue, and I don’t see the point of arguing with someone as capable as fp
2960 2018-01-01 19:25:58 BOUNTIES are "crypto payouts" for promoting a CRYPTO COIN.  They can be MASSIVE.  Hence, the also "massive" positive PUBLICITY on the different coins out there.  Don't trust anyone without some diligence...
2961 2018-01-01 19:25:56 The state will collapse when crypto replaces fiat as the primary currency of exchange. They won't be able to tax it. Until then we need to stop "wealth redistribution" however we can, which means stopping people form voting for it, which means keeping out the people who would.
2962 2018-01-01 19:25:53 Nice! It's a great start. I think what you are holding is all pretty good. This is crypto though and we are 1 announcement away from going either way. Keep up the diversified portfolio!
2963 2018-01-01 19:25:48 I invested 600€ (about 720$), currently I have ~950$. I bought my first #cryptocurrency on 28th December, so I earned 32% in 5 days!

2966 2018-01-01 19:25:38 yes it means nothing, delay are always there in software community. It's just that developer shouldn't have announced a formal deadline. GUI is a valid point but it for just creting new stealth address & it would be done in a day or two. Price is falling coz of FUDers like you.

2990 2018-01-01 19:22:41 I know how crypto works bro.. but Verge has not achieved the basics.. wraith protocol should have elevated XVG well over $0.40. I had 1.5 bitcoins sat there that I’ve moved to XLM which is a far safer and promising investment.. look into it

2992 2018-01-01 19:22:32 do you thought the price will go higher ?
it is way harder to manipulate if you go higher just to make it clear.
they will just sell as much as they can global will dump the price and bet on futures the price will go lower. its win win for them.

3000 2018-01-01 19:21:42 I really hope people aren’t listening to you for anything. The only reason you have any followers at all is because of your profile picture
3001 2018-01-01 19:21:42 yeah, the same network effects that help social media networks accelerate are the same ones that slow down crypto. the more people transacting, the slower it gets. still bullish on everything blockchain.
3002 2018-01-01 19:21:39 how is crypto news 'proven'? You mean no fake news/FUD?
3003 2018-01-01 19:21:39 I do not understand people. Programming is complex and difficult. Why is it so hard to wait a few months for a new protocol? Wraith is here and all time high in price is just matter of time. Dont sell your XVG cheap

3024 2018-01-01 19:20:13 Well sure, it’s just not hard to figure out why people would be so anti ripple. Personally, I think their needs to be a centralized crypto just because crypto is gonna become so mainstream banks will have to start using it and $xrp is the start.

3038 2018-01-01 19:18:55 Ripple is one of the most interesting concepts alive in the crypto market. I know I was just bashing this stuff but it apparently acts as a buffer phase when doing fiat money conversion thru various banks.
3039 2018-01-01 19:18:43 People crying over spending there own money at their own free will, poor decisions at risky entry points -blame yourself babies  Maybe disable your crypto account and get back to your 9 to 5
3040 2018-01-01 19:18:18 And is why we don't listen to anyone and accumulate every coin we can before the pumps. I'm a shitty trader, but crypto with a little research and TA goes a long way!
3041 2018-01-01 19:18:17 #LightningNetwork is the rising tide of Mininum Viable Utility for #crypto, and this forcing function will pressure #altcoins to deliver real value in 2018. When many fail to do so, the #altculling will begin, and capital will flow back to #BTC, proportionately.
3042 2018-01-01 19:18:16 Let me guess, your next counter will be that I’m a fake profile created a few days ago to shill verge? Your opinion won’t make me rich, so I don’t care about it. I’m not easily swayed by the masses unlike most people just now getting into crypto. Whenever there is FUD, buy.
3043 2018-01-01 19:18:10 I was being facetious as there is no product...definitely over hyped, even in the world of hype that is crypto 
3044 2018-01-01 19:18:09 If you’re into crypto, do not use @MercatoxCom . Withdraw my coins and haven’t received a single one. Unbelievable
3045 2018-01-01 19:18:04 I agree CME volume is 2K....but my study with futures tells me otherwise. I will get my answer when CME volume goes to 333K like gold. Cartel has never lost a game in 70 years. I need to wait.

3048 2018-01-01 19:17:48 I was thinking about something similar. Maybe keep 1 coin of every type I have. But the thing is that I might be checking the going rates anyway, so still mentally occupied with crypto coins.
3049 2018-01-01 19:17:38 Agreed. They rob and amass power for themselves. You and I might be smart and strong enough to defy them, but most are not. If the public at large gets spooked, they'll abandon crypto.

3076 2018-01-01 19:14:33 This sucks cuz I'm a newbie at everything, just learning how to "reply" to a tweet, don't know how to "retweet" or to start a tweet, and even if I won, I don't even know where to send it or what or where the "address" is ....lol
3077 2018-01-01 19:14:32 I get if you’re giving into FUD and jumping out of $xvg for another that’s pumping now (plenty are).

3107 2018-01-01 19:11:54 It's now seen as a way to get rich quick. People will jump from one crypto to the next once a crypto plateaus and a diff one does well. Unstable. Plus, cryptos actually are fiat. Ltd number of coins (in some cryptos), but there's an unlimited number of potential cryptocurrencies.

3113 2018-01-01 19:11:04 Crypto trades against USD, even if trade volume doesn't seem to show that. Also, use a logarithmic chart. Linear chart makes no sense whatsoever. And I would personally never touch ETC either. That project is dead.
3114 2018-01-01 19:11:02 Research the top sectors in crypto. Figure out what the masses want before they want it. Understand why some assets have pumped more than others. Which sectors are undervalued. Requires a lot of thinking on research done.

3120 2018-01-01 19:10:49 True. BTC is threatened by XRP that's for sure. But seriously, why would anyone invest in XRP? For the profit yes but its a centralized coin. It defeats the purpose of crypto as a whole.

#shillbabyshill

3130 2018-01-01 19:09:47 In 2018, I’ve (a) had a bike stolen and (b) lost the private key to a few thousand dollars worth of cryptocurrency. 

It’s only upwards from here!

(Fortunately the crypto was found money that was given to me when it was worth like $5. Also, lol.)
3131 2018-01-01 19:09:41 Give the hype a rest too :p
3132 2018-01-01 19:09:39 Also depends on how many shares on the difficulty of holding lol

3135 2018-01-01 19:09:24 @JohnCornyn Until a Crypto currency is converted to Fiat currency like USD it has no value. By taxing conversion between crypto currencies congress is effectively  taxing multiple times. In the end all crypto must be converted to Fiat. Why not tax that alone(SEC. 13303 )?

3212 2018-01-01 19:03:05 Nice project
3213 2018-01-01 19:02:56 Alright. That sucks if you want to look at a chart and that particular coin is not listed on coinigy. Guess ill have to keep looking. Cheers!
3214 2018-01-01 19:02:52 Justin sun and Charlie Lee are the two best leaders ive come accross in the entire crypto space.
3215 2018-01-01 19:02:52 Verge Blackpaper stated the upcoming update offers complete IP privacy, so you've taken something that was going to be and is now implemented on a new wallet and applied it to previous wallets?
3216 2018-01-01 19:02:51 I have buy limit for 11.5k as thats as low as I see it going in this coming week. Wish me luck
3217 2018-01-01 19:02:50 I'll be looking to add more from this sell off - this has big promise especially in emergency services and mobile gaming uses
3218 2018-01-01 19:02:41 Thanks for all @ElectracoinECA The best crypto dev.

3222 2018-01-01 19:02:30 Hold on a bit longer.. I am, not liking it... but not ready to give up yet.
3223 2018-01-01 19:02:28 Love your information.  Best realistic information I have read in crypto.  Quick question, I moved all my money into xvg, and it is dropping.  Do you suggest staying put and wait, or put else where till it starts to climb again?  Thanks

3233 2018-01-01 19:01:40 Binance is essentially the stock market for crypto currencies. 
That's where you trade for XRP or other alt-coins. But you can't buy alt coins directly, you need to go through a provider like Coinbase to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum.

3255 2018-01-01 19:00:06 New Years Crypto advice. Better to buy in using Etherium or BCH, transfer to your preferred Exchange then buy your ALT Coins of choice. However sell on the exchange for BTC. Therein lies the secret to making some extra $$$ and pay less fees.

3274 2018-01-01 18:58:57 I guess if you consider that most OGs, by virtue of the fact are OGs because they started during the phase in crypto where the concepts of decentralisation and "freedom" were of central importance, it's not hard to understand why most are biased against XRP. Elementary.

3292 2018-01-01 18:57:30 Thus the aforementioned 4 week wait on account confirmations. The issue is their low friction fiat-crypto option. Not the exchange itself..
3293 2018-01-01 18:57:29 Too modest numbers. $ADA and $XRP out of top 10? That's a defiant claim.
3294 2018-01-01 18:57:20 Expect a large crypto surge in the month of January. Notably a sizeable price shift in the 3rd or 4th week of the month.

3320 2018-01-01 18:53:46 Only one major miner and a select few leaders. Sure sounds #Decentralized to me!!
3321 2018-01-01 18:53:38 It means that they automatically tend to view decentralized coins more positively than centralized ones. Maybe it's justified, maybe its not. That's not the point. Just recognize that their thought process is colored by that, that's all.

3355 2018-01-01 18:50:31 The bias is Kaz is talking about is called the "halo effect," though done here in reverse. When evaluating something as a whole, we tend to substitute what we do know ("Decentralization is bad and this coin uses it") for what we don't ("Will this coin go down?")
3356 2018-01-01 18:50:11 And my axe.

3360 2018-01-01 18:49:51 They are so many good project outthere in this #crypto world, but the only subject of conversation is how can I make some money or what's the next #Bitcoin or #litecoin. It's would be really nice to talk about the application and howtgey can changes industries and institutions.
3361 2018-01-01 18:49:39 It's not about being right. That's the part you're missing.
3362 2018-01-01 18:49:38 All they had to do was communicate. By failing to do so they allowed the bears to take hold and trigger all the stop losses in place. They should definitely look to hiring a communications professional to handle their social media/telegram/discord. All cryptos should.
3363 2018-01-01 18:49:29 I have sooooo many crypto tax questions. Help me Adi-won Kenobi you’re my only hope!

3369 2018-01-01 18:49:06 LMAO
3370 2018-01-01 18:49:03 How about XRB?
3371 2018-01-01 18:48:59 Got to catch em all?!?
3372 2018-01-01 18:48:49 Hahaha you're telling the lead dev of the most secure, best working and most successful private cryptocurrency that he knows nothing?
3373 2018-01-01 18:48:47 $UTK. Will go 40x this year. PayPal for Crypto
3374 2018-01-01 18:48:42 exactly... if you do your reserach you will see. They fail at communication, probably... dont for get this is a open source project, there is no official marketing team, what for me personally, I prefer that than a crypto that works like a corporation #realcrypto #takeitorleaveit
3375 2018-01-01 18:48:41 Anybody who don't buy right now should really leave crypto . Soooooo many news just in 1 month for $gup. That's crazy
3376 2018-01-01 18:48:33 Bittrex has it at about 500-510 sats I think. Worth a stab imo
3377 2018-01-01 18:48:32 TEAM US CRYPTO BALLER is worth checking out on YouTube.  Look him up.  Tons of info on how to crush the ICO game.
3378 2018-01-01 18:48:32 This SO TRUE in crypto, and it happens faster. So many of the coins in the top fifty a year or two ago are now dead. But others are stronger than ever and still growing.
3379 2018-01-01 18:48:27 Strong correlation in crypto, both a friend and foe. You decide.
3380 2018-01-01 18:48:26 I’m learning all kinds of stuff about crypto exchanges by their APIs.... 
3381 2018-01-01 18:48:24 Hey guys, i'm curating this week. Let us get the Cryptocurrency and blockchain buzz going. I'll be replying all tweets and will be posting excerpts from the book all week. Join me as we begin 2018 with Crypto - @hemical
3382 2018-01-01 18:48:21 Not to mention they've been riding that wave and talking about how much the pump and the talk (because of Mac) is indicative of who they are.

3387 2018-01-01 18:47:40 Sorry to say, but you change your opinion like John McPumpfee. Of course you have right to do it, but you seem to be a bit unstable in your opinions. With a whole respect.
3388 2018-01-01 18:47:28 This profile is a scam @CryptosQueen
3389 2018-01-01 18:47:24 You just said it 100th time :)

3392 2018-01-01 18:47:03 Appreciate the work... awaiting your feedback
3393 2018-01-01 18:47:02 Once everyone knows how much better the stats(like block speed, confirmation times, fees, transactions per second, network scaleability) and #privacy features of $XVG #Verge are than other coins like $BTC $LTC $XMR $BCH etc, I see no reason why #XVG can't become the #NextBitcoin.
3394 2018-01-01 18:46:59 Fair enough ;) Happy New Year
3395 2018-01-01 18:46:56 @sumokoin would be a good pic. 20M marketcap, only on @Cryptopia_NZ and @livecoin_net now.
3396 2018-01-01 18:46:50 in your opinion do you see crypto taking over or been a new form of payment. As people love cash, i cant see it going digital for as least 5 years.
3397 2018-01-01 18:46:41 That's my vote

3403 2018-01-01 18:46:00 A year ago today I founded @ESG_Law, hoping 2017 was ready for an esports-only law firm. What a year it’s been.

We helped 12 teams get into the inaugural franchised leagues, negotiated some of the largest broadcast talent deals, and even supported a crypto token sale.
3404 2018-01-01 18:45:57 Once you start engaging in the "which one of these is the right side," you're activating your biases. Having no bias means you don't have feelings about either side.

3406 2018-01-01 18:45:44 #crypto players you know I hate speculation. I remarked about #TRX earlier today, but after this #EMB change to #Chartis and the coin swap, how can you not be all in on this? Blockchain integrated into GPS and 1st to do it? I’ll stay.

3407 2018-01-01 18:45:39 Why are you avoiding the question? here let me quote the website

'VERGE - The Privacy Coin...

Will show more and better data as the box gets more peers. Give it a few hours

Right now only Verge Core. Soon Electrum-XVG'

You're obviously talking about Wraith with this tweet
3408 2018-01-01 18:45:36 Buy on the rumor, sell on the news. If you are waiting for the wraith news as a reason to buy you are already losing :-(    Invest in #XVG simply because it is the best crypto out there!
3409 2018-01-01 18:45:32 what about Neo?
3410 2018-01-01 18:45:31 @JewKorean  is the man. As real as they get
3411 2018-01-01 18:45:29 はらうんかーーーいｗ
3412 2018-01-01 18:45:18 I’ll admit I had a feeling they would miss the deadline because there’s always issues that arise. It seemed like everything was too last minute and rushed. I’m still a believer though because once it’s fully operational, it’ll be a game changer!
3413 2018-01-01 18:45:07 @Interlogix any word on if your ultrasync panel will be compatible with Google home?
3414 2018-01-01 18:45:01 I've decided not to do a YouTube page or even be so vocal about crypto currencies and their profitability. TEAM US
3415 2018-01-01 18:44:59 Coin of the day : $trx and $XVG 
They are going up especially $XVG will increase a few days or weeks.

3416 2018-01-01 18:44:56 That 200BTC sell wall on $ICX is one hell of a buy signal in crypto. If you don't have $ICX in your portfolio, you should pick some up.

3421 2018-01-01 18:44:33 I spent my entire new year's day doing nothing but researching #crypto, and I must say, I enjoyed the fuck out of it. $crypto

3434 2018-01-01 18:43:16 Current price in sats? It's on Poloniex. May buy a small amount and store there.
3435 2018-01-01 18:43:16 尚、これも10万以下しかいれてない模様…笑
3436 2018-01-01 18:43:06 Best thing I did in 2017 was get into crypto 
3437 2018-01-01 18:43:03 紹介ありがとうございますー。
3438 2018-01-01 18:42:49 ステーキングはわたしもしてません。
3439 2018-01-01 18:42:48 Exactly
3440 2018-01-01 18:42:47 
3441 2018-01-01 18:42:46 LOL! This is fake. My TX shows an IP in the USA, which I'm not even using...
3442 2018-01-01 18:42:45 Roll 56454
3443 2018-01-01 18:42:42 @thehamcheeseJr also much cheaper Crypto's in comparison to $xrpusd I'd expect simple opportunity cost and FOMO to drive money out
3444 2018-01-01 18:42:42 It would be foolhardy for any crypto project to commit to a release date regardless of the software quality. That would be like aerospace engineers committing to launch a new rocket on a given date regardless of how many problems were left to be solved.
3445 2018-01-01 18:42:42 But again, before buying anything DYOR and make your own call
3446 2018-01-01 18:42:36 #xvg
For those that are crying because lost money on Verge, take that lesson!
In crypto you need to have patience, and you only loose when you sell.
I´m holding this moment, and loosing, but i dont care, because i know i will win in a few days.  The tech behind verge is amazing!
3447 2018-01-01 18:42:25 すげええ。もう1億円プレイヤーだね！
3448 2018-01-01 18:42:22 Happy new year everyone. #Crypto or not, #Shitcoins or #Bitcoin , men, women and children. Happiness, love and prosperity to all of you people out there! :)
3449 2018-01-01 18:42:19 I was new to crypto and i believed (i still do) that @SecretsOfCrypto is legend..so one day he posted a photo and link saying that he's starting a paid channel on telegram and i fell for it and gave away 0.3 btc . he wasn't starting any channel that was somebdy else 
3450 2018-01-01 18:42:18 We constantly research new channels that are relevant to our project to give the best chance for the messages to reach their intended audience. In such way, we keep attracting people who are passionate about crypto revolution and gambling.  #ICO and #XWIN
3451 2018-01-01 18:42:16 Allen, do you chart crypto currencies the way you chart stocks?
3452 2018-01-01 18:42:09 I bought on Bittrex, but I think they’ve closed new sign ups till further notice so unless you’ve already got an account you’re stuffed. Not used poloniex before..
3453 2018-01-01 18:42:08 Bought a bag full of $PAC 2 days ago and wow!  We on the rise baby! #Crypto
3454 2018-01-01 18:42:00 Not actual money and nothing backs it, it’s called crypto currency. Many believe at some point the scheme will collapse because nothing backs it. I will check one article I have read and post it through.

3459 2018-01-01 18:41:49 I don’t think that’s most peoples issue. Their issue was they have themselves a deadline that they knew they would miss and then waited until after it was missed and people sold off to address it. These tech guys need to understand they are now running a biz & should act as such

3486 2018-01-01 18:40:01 Hodl bro, undervalued, read into it very interesting - one of the fastest and the largest blockchains in existence. Tx speed 40x faster than bitcoin. I think long term anything under 500 sats is good.

3496 2018-01-01 18:39:16 (1/2) For what it’s worth, here’s my 2 cents. 

The price of $XVG right not doesn’t matter a whole lot to me because I’ve been HODLing for awhile and I continue to HODL for awhile longer. The important thing is the devs are still active fixing bugs and getting #WraithProtocol ..
3497 2018-01-01 18:39:14 I think : bears can pull only during this correction until $5000  the  $BTCUSD. (too low capitalization now and too mutch mainstream and 5000$ is a very hard support). A great reference 2013 winter. (but then mutch bigger cap%, no rival altcoins and no mainstream). #bitcoin

3509 2018-01-01 18:38:34 Hi  intense coin is  now  becoming  more popular  than any  other coins  in the  crypto world.
3510 2018-01-01 18:38:30 this is a suggestion for people investing more than they should 
#1 rule of crypto: 
be a man about your investments if you are comfortable enough to walk the line never doubt your self and just man up
3511 2018-01-01 18:38:29 $ost go baby hasn’t even started yet #crypto
3512 2018-01-01 18:38:29 Hmmm, food for thought. Starting to feel a bit like a Coke vs Pepsi thing.
3513 2018-01-01 18:38:28 I love the $XRP community. Calm headed and helpful people. I do not see the reason why people attack others because of crypto, well except this damn McAfee guy lmao. Let crypto space be a lovely space for learning, growth and support. #Cryptocurreny
3514 2018-01-01 18:38:26 So what? Atm it's going down and if it rises it will crash
3515 2018-01-01 18:38:22 but Wraith has has both Private and Public so how do you know these are not the visible ones on the public side?
3516 2018-01-01 18:38:17 Maybe the alt-coin p&d's we are now witnessing in #crypto are comparable to technology development in general over the years.

Technological changes in products usually move ahead few changes at a time for maximum profit right? - skipping a generation usually means lower profits.
3517 2018-01-01 18:38:14 easy, but remember new money for 2018 so im thinking higher than 1b

I see how easily I could manipulate the systems, whether it be an exchange, head/promoter of a crypto, or the system/logic that "crunches numbers" to determime value. Also..

3548 2018-01-01 18:35:26 The capitalization volume of cryptocurrency can only increase in 2018. The cryptocurrency market share in the world's economy is predicted to become 22% and exceed the share of the economy of the US. #transcrypt #crypto #bitcoin #trend

3572 2018-01-01 18:33:35 Only saying it once. Crypto
3573 2018-01-01 18:33:31 One single resolution: to 'check' less. (I don't mean facts) The addiction epidemic of checking (Twitter notifications, Facebook updates, crypto-coin prices etc) diminishes focus and energy that can be more productively spent elsewhere.
3574 2018-01-01 18:33:30 Happy New Year! Who's going to buy some diiiiips in 2018?!! #crypto
3575 2018-01-01 18:33:25 I’m excited about this coin!!!!  Glad I got in on the dip earlier today

3577 2018-01-01 18:33:09 I don’t know. Spys like to torture people for secret codes and information about crypto currencies.
3578 2018-01-01 18:33:05 If you're incapable of reading where IP's are logged from by reading five lines on a website how can you be focused on your work? or are you just intent on spreading fake news?
3579 2018-01-01 18:32:47 The worst feeling in $crypto is watching your bags go up knowing knowing you could have accumulated more. #altcoins #crypto
3580 2018-01-01 18:32:40 So you really trust their system they been working on for 4 years, that STILL isn’t working correctly, to store your coins? LMAO
3581 2018-01-01 18:32:39 ah my bad, thought you were another one of those fake XVG shillers, too many of those fuckers around, ruining the good name of crypto
3582 2018-01-01 18:32:36 There is a great book called 'The Art of Thinking Clearly' by Rolf Dobelli if you or anyone else wants to go deeper on some the bias we hold as humans. Many can be seen at play in the crypto world for sure.

3592 2018-01-01 18:31:08 The advantage of a highly centralized design. I think BTC is legacy technology as well, but XRP is not a decentralized, trustless cryptocurrency. You can't reasonably compare the two (though Ripple loves to pump XRP to the crypto moon kids with that apples to oranges comparison).
3593 2018-01-01 18:31:06 My Crystal ball  for what will make the technology world move in 2018: 
- 5G 
- Self Driving Autonomy Level 4 
- Blockchain + Crypto 
- Robotics and automation 
- Augmented Reality + Virtual Reality = XR 
- Power and Energy

3616 2018-01-01 18:28:39 It will happen. When, no idea but certainly within our lifetime. Automatic tax collection and transparency is the end goal. The emergence of blockchain just sped up the process for governments. All competing crypto will get banned just like issuing own currency.

3641 2018-01-01 18:25:57 XRP is a native crypto token.  It's not backed by anything.  Other tokens, however, can be issued on the XRP ledger that can be backed by fiat.  Entities called Ripple gateways have been doing that since 2013.  No mystery there.

3644 2018-01-01 18:25:33 I agree but it does seem that crypto currency currently is more safe than stocks. Factors to push the value of crypto currency down are few and weak.

3650 2018-01-01 18:24:38 pretending not to understand me is not an effective way to demonstrate a lack of trans antagonism. if you are comfortable with that, we can be done! i have learned enough about you already. crypto trans antagonists are a penny a dozen.

3657 2018-01-01 18:23:55 @XVGWhale you’re not doing the community any favours at this point by just spamming hype. A lot of trust was lost last night. You need to step out of the limelight unless you’re actually communicating with the dev team directly. #verge #xvg #crypto
3658 2018-01-01 18:23:54 $DBC is in an interesting space, currently only listed on kucoin but soon to be on huobi and hopefully others.
3659 2018-01-01 18:23:32 I've held COLX for a few months now. I think it has room to grow. I'm biased towards Phore, as the marketplace and newly released roadmap should put it at the top of the list of privacy coins.

3684 2018-01-01 18:20:42 I'm certainly not planning on working on Verge, so I'm not sure how your Tweet is at all relevant.

3720 2018-01-01 18:16:27 Remember, when investing in Crypto, just because a price of a coin is "cheaper" than others, by no way means it's better.

The price of a coin is determined by *the market cap* / the supply of coins.

3724 2018-01-01 18:15:47 You didn't address the tweet which pointed out that the IoT Chain project is a concept today and $ITC token is little more than an ERC20 token. One could argue that most crypto coins have been wash traded and most exchanges are dodgy no matter how large.

3752 2018-01-01 18:13:03 New to crypto but not to futurism. So happy I have a mere 125 @Ripple .

3755 2018-01-01 18:12:46 I'm back in with Verge $XVG at 1193 sat. I feel this is a big dip and a good time to buy. Verge is the crypto currency for the bitcoin purist. Privacy, speed, limited supply, and managed by crypto geniuses.
3756 2018-01-01 18:12:44 Yes thank goodness, because if I were it would actually work.
3757 2018-01-01 18:12:40 Anyone want to tell me what tools they’re using for crypto-investments? (apps, websites, resources, etc)

Hiccups discouraged some, oh well, short sellers deserve to get #rekt. Realistically, now $XVG can hit $10 in 2018, by far the best #currency.
3770 2018-01-01 18:11:18 2017 was the year of hype for $crypto, 2018 will be the year that most tokens’/coins’ use cases will come into fruition $btc $ltc $eth #CryptoCurrency
3771 2018-01-01 18:11:14 Ahhh... Patience... Thinking, might do some crypto trivia for prizes soon. Trying to think of the next giveaway.
3772 2018-01-01 18:11:05 My take on ignorance in the links is: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." To learn what crypto actually is, how it works, what it does, I recommend YouTube videos of Andreas Antonopoulos.

3784 2018-01-01 18:09:36 Yeah agree, inexperience breads idiot mentality. People will profit longer term. I urged these people to add to their bank for 12 months and get 50c in that period for their $50.

3796 2018-01-01 18:08:09 The BannerCoin project enables website merchants to accept crypto side-by-side w/credit cards. They don't need to integrate separate payment systems and backend processing is automated. The token is redeemable for service credits w/BannerView.com and a required payment method.
3797 2018-01-01 18:08:08 Okay, I was assuming that all crypto in the currency will be changed to PQ eventually.

3800 2018-01-01 18:07:59 Work out, buy LEGAL weed (just because) Keto, Mate's License, Trade, and Crypto. Yeah 2018!! GO AND GET IT!!
3801 2018-01-01 18:07:45 1.) I took a full year to research this market, its uptrends , its downtrends. Made gains, made losses, learnt to reevaluate. Time to share experiences in 2018.
3802 2018-01-01 18:07:42 Now it looks bad if your all money is in verge
3803 2018-01-01 18:07:14 It has lightning network too!
3804 2018-01-01 18:07:13 First step is to read any technical documents out out by the core devs of #crypto. Expand to any additional reading you need to do to conceptually understand the technical documents. Reading all primary literature from the devs is a good place to start.
3805 2018-01-01 18:07:06 No $DRGN bruh??? Pffff

3811 2018-01-01 18:06:34 The only people I see charting $BTC saying it is going down, say that they barely hold any $BTC in the first place.  I wonder why they want $BTC to tank if they are heavy into alts???

3815 2018-01-01 18:06:19 Says you...where is the "Verge Team" to combat these "lies"?  Verge is run by inexperienced kids and this whole Wraith release proves that. They need to hire professionals. May be a good product, but letting kids hype it for them with no commo is killing it.
3816 2018-01-01 18:06:17 All FUDers said #XVG was a scam yesterday and that #Wraith wasn’t a real product. Wraith is out, so now since it didn’t moon you still call it a scam. You people make my head hurt.
3817 2018-01-01 18:06:12 Market manipulation,insider trading, pumping and dumping, great for the elect few. For the remainder of us honest hardworking people this behaviour spells disaster as all it does for us is invite strict regulation into the crypto sphere!

3834 2018-01-01 18:05:02 If say a country like Croatia with its 80 billion debt pile issued crypto and said crypto had 100 billion market value like ripple of whatever this means all debt is callable and can be retired. Huge repercussions for economics. Changes everything.
3835 2018-01-01 18:04:46 So confusing 
3836 2018-01-01 18:04:40 Which brings me to the question :whether crypto is all about money and less about utility and tech?

I'm not even at 20 between crypto, commodities and stocks and I want to pare it down.

3841 2018-01-01 18:04:12 Yes.  Scary.  The state is coming after crypto.  No doubt.  I think the answer is anon coins.
3842 2018-01-01 18:03:59 hi sarah, do u know what's the main differences between Moreno #XMR and Verge #XVG , thanks! :)
3843 2018-01-01 18:03:53 hahah... that moment when you disagree with two big WAVES bag holders and they get butthurt.
I'm not saying Waves doesn't currently have any value at all, but once other projects take off (for example Komodo's DEX) Waves will get squashed... again, don't get butthurt plz, 2 cents
3844 2018-01-01 18:03:44 DOnt you believe in TRX dude?
3845 2018-01-01 18:03:29 Some people throw $50 in and expect it to go to the moon. Having said that verge did over 12 months!

3851 2018-01-01 18:03:13 Also imagine the effects on sovereign funding if it can issue crypto and not debt. Effects are the same, but revenue basically becomes instant surpluss. It's better than negative real rates. There's just so much potential with this.

3860 2018-01-01 18:02:14 I believe the problem everyone is having is the lack of communication. You have the idiot @xvgwhale on here hyping the coins value so he can get rich, people like @officialmcafee doing the same since he didn't get his big payoff and we are left with crickets waiting for answers.

3863 2018-01-01 18:01:56 @justinvendetta Crypto world is filled with babies. Sorry guys it wasn’t a perfect release, but that happens in business. Why doesn’t everyone bail on Apple when they push back deadlines? Spoiled brats need to bail or hodl, either way no1 cares. Thanks for your hard work! 
3864 2018-01-01 18:01:43 As everyone knows, IRS has released clearer tax code and is betting on crypto to bring in some money, I call that adoption. This makes me more comfortable creating a team with a real payroll.  It’s important the person(s) hired have a career without fear of regulatory closure -T

3901 2018-01-01 17:58:14 Pump and dump is wrecking noobs. Buying into hype from  bad marketers (not bad tech) hoping to get rich tomorrow. The ones who will profit in the end are whales triggering pump and dumps and HODLRs who were in before the crypto boom and are investing in the tech long term.

3910 2018-01-01 17:57:31 it's about the decentralisation matter. both cryptos have their eligibility. but from the libertarian and crypto point of view: BTC is gold, XRP is not. Just an answer, not an assessment.

3913 2018-01-01 17:57:28 This also means if CBs issue crypto with all the necessary infrastructure, and it slowly gains share among conventional currencies cash basically goes extinct and every single transaction is traceable, which is the opposite of what crypto people are going for.

3933 2018-01-01 17:55:38 Qiwi (NASDAQ: $QIWI) spikes after iBankCoin notes the company has plenty of crypto exposure. The stock, though, hasn't received nearly the sort of investor interest or major stock price pop of names like Riot Blockchain ( $RIOT), Longfin ( $LFIN), or Crypto Co. ( $CRCW).
3934 2018-01-01 17:55:36 The #crypto market will take over.  will legalize recreational #marijuana. Take control of your money, stay medicated, and stay lifted. #Welcome2018 #bitcoin #litecoin #ethereum #siacoin #Aphria

3939 2018-01-01 17:54:52 Bitcoin to you then is only for hedge funds and financial institutions?  What about everyone else on the planet?
3940 2018-01-01 17:54:49 i dnt want to rretire, ever, i love doing everything i do(althought having the money to hire someone to run my store full time would be awesome!), but i enjoy crypto because of all the possibilities that can be created, i just wish i had more time in the day!!! hahaha
3941 2018-01-01 17:54:46 You forgot the Dutch project GET tickets, working product(unlike it competitors) while it is now around ico price it has the potential to go x10 once they get a big exchange listing.

3947 2018-01-01 17:54:31 Statistically speaking your odds of the darts sticking stay the same, but the more you throw the more stick, and don’t. Volume vs. Probability
3948 2018-01-01 17:54:30 A crypto that has to steal a name rather than get its own is a bitch that can’t make a name for itself. Bitchcoin is accurate.

3958 2018-01-01 17:53:31 If they want the game to be successful it needs to be in English. The language of crypto currency is currently english
3959 2018-01-01 17:53:28 Diversification in crypto should not be thought in the same way it is with traditional markets
3960 2018-01-01 17:53:26 Happy New Year to all! Year 2018 will bring wealth to those in crypto. Majority of computer litrates in first world and China will jump in to crypto mania. $btc will reach $60,000. $XRP will overtake btc in market share. Smaller coins specially privacy coins will breakout bigtime
3961 2018-01-01 17:53:18 SBD
3962 2018-01-01 17:53:17 Your recommendation is just a coincidence,  silly
3963 2018-01-01 17:53:16 Your mcm bought 0.0001 bitcoin and calls himself a crypto investor. All he knows about is bitcoin.
3964 2018-01-01 17:53:11 My thoughts exactly.  I would run from any crypto he pumped.
3965 2018-01-01 17:53:10 Everyone's finally paying attention to crypto and this is the way the community acts the tech did have a chance but count on people fucking it up everytime if I was new and seen the way most of you act id be afraid to dip a finger in this pool #cryptocurrency #ada #salt #btc
3966 2018-01-01 17:53:05

3969 2018-01-01 17:52:58 If you were a complete newbie, and wanted to throw a couple hundred in a crypto, just because, what would you do?  Just itching to get involved. @Mazmasta
3970 2018-01-01 17:52:55 I think, for this moment, it's more a question: Which crypto exchange will be the most valuable for 2018. The most exchanges are too much amateur to carry the growth of crypto at this moment.
3971 2018-01-01 17:52:53 I've sold my kidney to buy more #DRGN (it's OK I rekt them with booze anyway) 10x by easter

4009 2018-01-01 17:50:36 I think there are a lot of people in the crypto market who don't know, understand, or care to know the differences between the various coins

4056 2018-01-01 17:46:58 What gives you the right to define what crypto is or isn't? And if your argument consists of "cus banks" and cus "seems centralized cus banks" then I will end this conversation because there is point debating with someone that does not do any research.

4086 2018-01-01 17:44:54 Coinbase = the dickwads of crypto. This will be a fight to the death imo, -Coinbase and Bitcoin users are on opposite sides of this battle. We need to replace Coinbase or out compete them or both.
4087 2018-01-01 17:44:52 I wonder how much the @Apple employees will make, who will approve the next iOS update with the next coin on #coinbase #xrp #crypto #cryptonews before the official news release.
4088 2018-01-01 17:44:52 If you wanna make money in a gold rush, sell shovels...If you wanna make money in a crypto craze, sell mining servers/electricity.
4089 2018-01-01 17:44:50 Target Sir? Entry? Stop loss? Take profit %? Retracement levels? Extension levels?

Thanks Sir.
4090 2018-01-01 17:44:48 Crypto currencies are worthless.  Good for nothing but pyramiding speculation, empty hot air!
4091 2018-01-01 17:44:47 Crypto is such a young game and developers are just humans. I got bored of Lisk and got out a while back. I have HODL'd @electroneum and @Cappasity since ICO. @vergecurrency has potential. Also @Dashpay

4096 2018-01-01 17:44:05  i just hope we all realize what ripple is trying to do in crypto before its too late. it was a good money grab to invest in diff coins, but now its getting dangerous.
4097 2018-01-01 17:44:03 Shilling  a coin that’s down 20% after a huge release. Go home Sarah you’re a troll in the crypto world
4098 2018-01-01 17:43:54 Bad idea to bring in regulators. If done Top-Down,

1. It will favour the already big and rich.
2. Crypto is a language. All it would do is create a new language that will be spoken by the same community. And we don't know if that language is better than the one we already have.

4139 2018-01-01 17:41:45 On this episode of American Greed, crypto goes to a new low. Promises unkept lead to wrath unforeseen.

4141 2018-01-01 17:41:38 Aeon , monero’s little sister but faster. privacy coins could be huge in 2018
4142 2018-01-01 17:41:30 $drgn ICO's starting on the platform, only on 2 exchanges yet, massive interest, will boom when hits bigger exchange.
4143 2018-01-01 17:41:26 How about $DRGN? A couple of ICOS are already announced and the coin has a high probability of getting listed on @binance
4144 2018-01-01 17:41:25 Have y'all ever heard "there's no such thing as bad press?" You should be buying this right now even because they're CLOSE to having it done! The most popular (good or bad) crypto in the world right now, when wraith is finished people WILL buy this stuff $XVG
4145 2018-01-01 17:41:23 That's awesome that you have a working product.  But the unfortunate truth is that people are here to make money.  Not buy coins for their functionality...yet.  One day that time may come for verge.  But for now, the crypto word is being abused like a red-headed step child.
4146 2018-01-01 17:41:20 $GAS when people start to realize its value and start to compare its market cap to its big brother NEO. Could be a 1:1 market cap ratio in the future. Extremely undervalued. $BAT also undervalued still. Creator of JavaScript as founder... great vision and browser ecosystem.
4147 2018-01-01 17:41:20 I keep hearing from people that they’re scared of crypto because it’s not backed by anything. Let’s clear this fallacy up, crypto is backed by math and math is priceless #truth #crypto #priceless #mathgeek
4148 2018-01-01 17:41:09 RippleやQASHみたいな中央集権的な仮想通貨は、特定分野など仮想通貨の市場の一角で基軸になり、市場全体にもある程度影響力を持っている、ぐらいの住み分けができるとみんな幸せになりそうな気がするなあ。
4149 2018-01-01 17:40:58 Second this.
4150 2018-01-01 17:40:57 Hmm… can't you explain that in one sentence? "E2e crypto means 'do not trust server' + 'server serves JS files' = 'server can modify them & attack private key'?

I could only see an easier way if @alexlehmannfilm would maybe explain e2e crypto in general.
4151 2018-01-01 17:40:57 why are y'all talking about taxes?

4152 2018-01-01 17:40:52 Millions of #XVG on sell limits under 25¢ on Binance. Don’t these people realize they are keeping the price below 20¢? Cancel all those sell orders and watch.

4220 2018-01-01 17:37:39 No need the prove squat to you, don't like it? Move on, sell if you have any, and when it becomes the main crypto down the track, have your bucket ready for your tears.

4223 2018-01-01 17:37:28 $XRP is being used by banks/institutions/market makers for cross-border payments and for replacing nostro/vostro accounts globally - there is real utility/value in it - and it saves these banks a lot of money on fee's, which is real value for them

4224 2018-01-01 17:37:24 This will be such an oversubscribed class. Have seen so much interest in crypto and investing as a result even on non tech campuses.
4225 2018-01-01 17:37:18 Only a matter of time before Crypto is a class offered at basically every university
4226 2018-01-01 17:37:18 A series of good points why the mere thought of crypto currencies terrify the status-quo of power brokers. No longer are they able to exploit, control and extort from the “sheeple”.
4227 2018-01-01 17:37:13 I agree, I have been watching others and saw that I could have made quick money the past few days.. I almost bought POE the other day at 499 but decided to hold for XVG since I spent so much time on it already.. If I wanted to break even 950 sats would be my zero profit point.

4229 2018-01-01 17:37:02 #crypto is teaching a lot of people about what money is, and economics in general... knowledge they should have been taught in school. 
But then again, just like money, educations is largely in hands of governments and their retard cronies.
4230 2018-01-01 17:36:50 I dont mind if it crashes hard now, it will go back later, they tend to do that! #crypto
4231 2018-01-01 17:36:47 The token will be added to the largest crypto-exchanges during the first week after the ICO,  among them are Bittrex, Poloniex, and Bitfinex, as described in their rules of use. #eChatICO #eChat #TokenSale #blockchain
4232 2018-01-01 17:36:45 agreed...this is not decentralization!!!! come on now people, wake up. I got in crypto because of the idea of being decentralized and changing the world as we know it!. Also, the profits dont hurt either
4233 2018-01-01 17:36:18 Haha I have been in #crypto less than a year and the reason I got involved was @Ripple just wish I joined it sooner. Doesn't mean I m not interested in other #crypto to, can't people just be happy for others. Oh well keep up the good work @haydentiff!
4234 2018-01-01 17:36:01 Use bancor imo
4235 2018-01-01 17:35:58 Let's take great advantages of crypto currencies.....One thing we need to master is that even bitcoin was once $0.10 and invest wisely. ...

4237 2018-01-01 17:35:51 @PascalCoin is innovative, non ICO, non premine coded from a scratch crypto with deletable blockchain and safebox technology 
4238 2018-01-01 17:35:45 I admire your contributions to this community & you have helped a lot of people here but I have respectfully disagree with $VTC being worthless, I’m not sure why you would think this considering you are a $LTC supporter? There’s more than enough market for both to coexist.
4239 2018-01-01 17:35:41 1st - preface - i own both $xrp & $xlm - i think they both have their own merrits & will both be successful in their own ways

Ripple uses their $XRP to incentivize market makers / institutions and overall help grow the $XRP network - most sign agreements to not dump as well  /1
4240 2018-01-01 17:35:40 Lol.... Ripple isn't #crypto

4243 2018-01-01 17:35:21 Don't fall for this BS. This guy posts the same thing post over and over. Obvious spam
4244 2018-01-01 17:35:15 Compare actual supply and maximum supply. Ripple company owns 70% of max supply. When they start dumping it, they will obtain BitCoin that is hard to produce with their digitally printed garbage that costs nothing to produce. #Crypto

4251 2018-01-01 17:34:05 The crypto market will grow in 2018 and all market caps will grow as well. As for getting to a $1 it’s pretty far but not in possible.
4252 2018-01-01 17:33:57 Btw, big props to you @Crypto_Core crypto_cand the others at #wolfpack for all you do. I thoroughly enjoyed the preview last month and will be back as vip when the funds allow.
4253 2018-01-01 17:33:52 @bitconnectre what platform do you use to trade crypto? I have a Coinbase account but what about the alt currencies?
4254 2018-01-01 17:33:44 Lol this coins done people his tweets are not holding it up you clown almost 1 billion in trade volume . If you think anyone’s tweets influenced that your an idiot and get out of crypto
4255 2018-01-01 17:33:31 自分のポートフォリオほとんどQASHになってるぐらい期待してるんだけど、その上で、仮想通貨のそもそもの役目を考えるとQASHは「仮想通貨の基軸」になるべきではないと思っている。それはあくまでBTC,BCH,ETHあたりの非中央集権的な仮想通貨が担う方がいいのかなと。Rippleも同様。
4256 2018-01-01 17:33:31 #crypto 2018 is going to be financially rewarding
4257 2018-01-01 17:33:15 Going into 2018 with $SPHTX, $DRGN , $ICX , $WAN , $POA. Top 5 for a top year!
4258 2018-01-01 17:33:12 hey mate dou have masternodes of MEME if so is it profitable? ty
4259 2018-01-01 17:32:54 My evidence is that XRP is controlled by banks which is the total opposite of why cryptos were invented. Crypto will be long dead before XRP gets to 10K$
4260 2018-01-01 17:32:50 Trash coming out yet again. This time, two.
4261 2018-01-01 17:32:49 I don't like to make predictions but here we go (USD values)

4262 2018-01-01 17:32:36 Just got mine yesterday!!!
4263 2018-01-01 17:32:20 I wonder if those projects will return more value back than the appreciation of the crypto they raised 
4264 2018-01-01 17:32:02 $xrp real worth is about $0.10 #Crypto
4265 2018-01-01 17:31:58 Oh shit I fell for it, I'm ashamed lol

4268 2018-01-01 17:31:53 Hopefully 2018 will be the year of Crypto ! #richin2018 
4269 2018-01-01 17:31:41 Its short-sighted to think that #crypto will evolve without joint cooperation w/ research; investment groups. #Ripple has brilliant minds working on #XRP If you exclude them from running w the pack, its likely #crypto will fail. #Crypto dogma needs change and challenge. #altcoins

4272 2018-01-01 17:31:25 It is a shame that at no point can we rely on ability to transact in or with crypto. Every few months its some different bullshit. This month I have to fix broken electrums, macos, pay 2x btc fees...just to put gas in the car 
4273 2018-01-01 17:31:24 Another great day on crypto so far. +50% on my Pf mostly from trading $tnt and $ost. Alt season looking like it’s going to be very profitable. Looking forward to $Trx next move.
4274 2018-01-01 17:31:24 same i had 323557 xvg and day trade made me lose allot when it go from 55 to 300 in a few hours and get in with only 78000 so i dont like day trade ..... BCD work still nice on day trade get in on 40usd and sell around 60-70usd but all other is get and hold
4275 2018-01-01 17:31:18 Not my money  I smelled your scam from a mile away 
4276 2018-01-01 17:31:10 I see. Thank you for the information!!
4277 2018-01-01 17:31:00 I think Dash has the potential to be the 'Facebook' of crypto: successful but with scammy underpinnings and likely to respond "how high?" when told to jump. Hope I'm wrong.
4278 2018-01-01 17:30:56 Are you retarded, he's not calling out fluffy lol, he's using him as evidence of the legitimacy of the link he posted, which exploits the fact that XVG isn't private
4279 2018-01-01 17:30:53 Happy New Years from the Vault family to yours! Expecting huge growth in 2018. More wonderful things in the #Crypto world!
4280 2018-01-01 17:30:51 Appreciate your opinion. As a libertarian I think this is a beautiful revolution but it’s too naive to think the Cartel will just fold.  They have an infinite supply of the printing press after all.
4281 2018-01-01 17:30:49 So I am lazy. What about #XRP been given to banks at discount and only actually been used for transaction fees. Not actual value. If you could enlighten me. Honest question.
4282 2018-01-01 17:30:47 @Crypt0pher This is why I fuck with Crypto. Takes Gov control away by force

4286 2018-01-01 17:30:23 2/2 But $5.4B is also less than 1% of the $600B crypto market cap, which was the major source for this funding. 
Questions for 2018: 
Can the system produce another $5B in ICO funding next year? And if the market cap goes to $1T, will that yield $10B for 1,000 ICOs in 2018?

4289 2018-01-01 17:30:12 I wish I would have seen this weeks ago, before I spent a bunch on Crypto Kitties.  :-/  Now I have to spend a bunch on TRX Dogs.  These dogs look way cooler than the kitties.  Hey Justin, if you're giving away any exclusive TRX Dogs, I would gladly accept.  :-)
4290 2018-01-01 17:30:08 Good point. Lol
4291 2018-01-01 17:30:01 Depends. If you plan on long term hodling (like 3-5+ years) than not at all you're still early. If you wanna flip it for a quick profit then maybe wait for a pull back
4292 2018-01-01 17:29:59 i don't think @petertoddbtc cares to know the truth - his ego is now tied up in this argument so he will stick with it because it gets him the most cred / likes / followers in his close-minded community

4349 2018-01-01 17:25:10 Your economics theory works only in traditional economics. They don’t apply to crypto... even TA dont apply in crypto.

4360 2018-01-01 17:24:18 What’s your biggest weakness as an investor in the crypto space?
                                                                     
The lure to go into everything that looks good is by far mine!!!!

4362 2018-01-01 17:23:52 Happy for you birbo :)))
4363 2018-01-01 17:23:31 in 2017 ICOs raised $2.3B...amazing for project funding, trivial for securities.  That is like a good Thursday at a major Investment Bank. Hybrid security offerings (Traditional + Crypto) will be 100X bigger.  Lets hope we see some in 2018.
4364 2018-01-01 17:23:20 Archi intéressant la crypto-monnaie j'viens dme tapper un p'tits cours où j'ai fait que lire pendant 2h30 bah j'en ai appris des choses sa mère
4365 2018-01-01 17:23:17 funny you say that, since @Ripple is partnered with the @gatesfoundation to help millions of people in 3rd world countries - lol , do a little research man - you're stuck in your ways
4366 2018-01-01 17:23:16 dotcom saw the rise of the techie / entrepreneur.
crypto will see the rise of techie / empire builder.

4367 2018-01-01 17:23:12 Got into crypto about 3 weeks ago, addictive or what can’t keep away from my iPad lol
4368 2018-01-01 17:23:09 A less judgmental version of myself ;) . On a serious note, goal is to make some decentralized applications involving crypto economics.

Is enough ? DYOR and dont say shit because many newbies could believe this
4371 2018-01-01 17:22:49 Twitter'ın network efektinden faydalanmak üzere crypto ruhuna aykırı ve ölü networkleri övme gayretinde olanlar gülünç duruma düşerler

4382 2018-01-01 17:21:27 In my opinion stay away from #verge #XVG its risky now and not clearly about iys future.invest in #Ethereum #XRP #Ripple #ADA #Cardano its guranted future and stable invests.
4383 2018-01-01 17:21:25 $XRP If you are about transaction speeds in crypto, check out $RDN
4384 2018-01-01 17:21:21 lol, educate yourself please - you lose a lot of credibility with tweets like this. i own $XRP, i own my private keys, they are just as safe as the $BTC which i also own

4401 2018-01-01 17:18:54 PSA: when withdrawing crypto from an exchange, never withdraw more than you can afford to lose in a single transaction

you never know how long support is going to take to get back to you

this is the sad reality we live in 

crypto exchanges, do better in 2018
4402 2018-01-01 17:18:53 失望売りで買えるので問題、、ないです！
4403 2018-01-01 17:18:42 You will like vrc then
4404 2018-01-01 17:18:18 I think the best moment in this year, and in principle in life it is an investment in the crypto currency, ripple I think my favorite!
4405 2018-01-01 17:18:10 My crypto  investment  I think @vergecurrency  is going to light and shine my portfolio.
4406 2018-01-01 17:18:07 そんな気がすごくしています...
4407 2018-01-01 17:17:54 Maybe some crypto-fash dev on the team leaving a little easter egg?
4408 2018-01-01 17:17:43 #hypothetically if no one reports to the IRS of their #crypto “property” transactions, the exchanges don’t report, and all off your USD cash outs are under $10k, who is gonna know? 
4409 2018-01-01 17:17:35 @tymoss What app do you use for crypto?
4410 2018-01-01 17:17:10 The January Scientific American mag has a cover story on crypto-currencies.
4411 2018-01-01 17:17:06 What She's sayin' : Yup you're confused : Never said I had a problem with TOR or Orbot : I said you don't need a COIN just to use it with #crypto
4412 2018-01-01 17:16:59 Kucoinの銘柄で取引量が多く、Binanceの人気投票に上がってたので気になって調べたら、中身に惹かれました。
4413 2018-01-01 17:16:51 Talking about low caps - 20X coins

$lmc target (few months hold) 
Current mkt cap is 30,000,000 usd
4414 2018-01-01 17:16:45 My primary app as well... wish they had more coins listed though.... the combo of cryptopro and bitscreener covers most coins

4416 2018-01-01 17:16:37 Yeah, I am betting it's their crypto/fiat exchange. 100% trying to get in on it.
4417 2018-01-01 17:16:21 Yes crypto crimson is a valuable, reputable source.
4418 2018-01-01 17:16:16 @cryptomocho good call on $MEME , guess what’s next on Bittrex? Yes another Masternode Coin - $KORE 
4419 2018-01-01 17:16:11 Still haven't received my #Bcash. A few thousand dollars missing. No response in DMs from @CoinbaseSupport . Horrendous customer service. I won't turn Fiat to crypto w/ Coinbase until this is resolved. Brian, can you help me? 
4420 2018-01-01 17:16:00 John how much did you make. guys like you abuse this crypto market. #abuse
4421 2018-01-01 17:15:52 Ya buddy! Finally a solid coin you pump, this will survive any bubble, it's getting real world use with big companies, my favorite coin right now and I have been around a long time in crypto.
4422 2018-01-01 17:15:35 Some people in the crypto space still don't understand the correlation between the number of circulating/max supply of coins and price. How in the world a max supply of 100,000,000,000 of xrp going to reach $400 each?

4445 2018-01-01 17:13:03 By investing in #xrp you are investing directly in xRapid platform! 60% less costs for financial institutions! Who wouldn't like to use #xrp
4446 2018-01-01 17:12:38 I didn’t miss out at all I bought and sold that coin numerous times I’m a day trader I don’t just buy hold and pray...but Ripple is a bad coin it’s against what crypto is all about that’s why I say screw ripple
4447 2018-01-01 17:12:23 Right. But a lot crypto people are kind of pessimistic and paranoid and not prone to that sunny "everyone will learn via Khan academy" vibe.
4448 2018-01-01 17:12:14 I am so happy to see  similar minded people in crypto space. Every day i see tweets with same thoughts as mine. Defenitaly on of the best and most fun community.
4449 2018-01-01 17:12:08 Are we going to see a crypto currency under #hashgraph technology in 2018? #Happy2018

And I agree with you, I think they are tired as hell.

4462 2018-01-01 17:10:46 How does it work with "Larger" transactions? ;)   My wallet is DN81F3wHFSPCn9WGMVMxEhoGypk7JgBYPo   if you want to test it out on me LOL

4503 2018-01-01 17:05:11 Will check IT and then decide
4504 2018-01-01 17:05:09 It seems Coinbase is missing out on a lot of money by not hosting a high-volume crypto like $XRP, whereas XRP’s main function doesn’t require Coinbase. I’m not sure the tables aren’t a little more equal than you might imagine.
4505 2018-01-01 17:05:08 Ahhh thanks! I was too impatient and used btc as eth is currently down for maintenance so no deposits possible. Haha patience is key!

4518 2018-01-01 17:04:05 Banks in Australia started to realize the power of Cryptos  that's the reason I think to freeze them. Only if people start to accept crypto currency instead of fiat then flippening will happen from fiat to crypto but it will take a lot of time for that transition.
4519 2018-01-01 17:04:04 Shouldn't that also include releasing new the mainnet in summer as per your roadmap??

4524 2018-01-01 17:03:41 $ZRX, partially for the tech, but from a macro standpoint, I think people in the know are just accumulating the shit outta this
4525 2018-01-01 17:03:36 What a great way to start 2018. First $DNT. Now $ARK. #crypto. Let's Go!
4526 2018-01-01 17:03:35 I think the number of HODLERs across the crypto market is about to increase drastically. The culture established in this market is special
4527 2018-01-01 17:03:33 True. But over the next 4 1/2 years the way the escrows are structured the predictability of how much being released will be known.

4531 2018-01-01 17:02:52 This is a longer convo than twitter allows in a single tweet. Crypto bottoming out is tied to blockchain & tangle limits in relation to addressable market participant cap. We're nowhere near the limits or caps. Happy to discuss further. 
4532 2018-01-01 17:02:30 my sister judge me so much for checking crypto trading at 1am
4533 2018-01-01 17:02:27 It is pathetic that you hold and you sell and then you bash. Why did you buy in the first place just to speculate? XVG is not for that... Hence u got rolled over
4534 2018-01-01 17:02:11 As we leave 2017 behind, I want to congratulate everyone who's been a part of this crypto journey! BION, you're all creating history right now and leaving something behind for the whole world to see! One love and happy new year to all of you, 2018 is waiting for you! Go get it!

4539 2018-01-01 17:01:50 Nice! We enjoy hearing stories of people applying real life benefits with crypto profits. Perks of playing the game right.

4596 2018-01-01 16:55:54 Technically the crypto Ponzi scam is a video game. It’s a digital illusion akin to pokemon ...1,300 crypto’s and counting ...gotta catch them all cryptomon!!!
4597 2018-01-01 16:55:51 Biggest challenge for me in crypto is the amount of doubt I have in my own ability to do things I’m not already good at.
4598 2018-01-01 16:55:35 Would you just look at that, $POE woke right up as expected. The crypto world is a funny place.

4600 2018-01-01 16:55:31 The internet was technically confusing at first. And while it is vastly larger and more complex, it’s also much easier to use. Some of those same developers and UI designers are now stepping up to making crypto better. I have hope.

4632 2018-01-01 16:52:03 @RealBulletBarry Someone hacked our crypto and released it into the air. Sounds like somebody releasing gigarams into the atmosphere doesnt it? Do you even know how cryptos work? 3blue1brow made a good video on the general concepts. Please watch it before you make another video.
4633 2018-01-01 16:51:59 Yeah I figured as much. I lost connection after a couple of days, then when I tried to reconnect I had to wait a while to find a space. If verges price drops no doubt people will flock back to other coins.

I think $XRP is still overvalued and will correct harder. Let’s see how the next week plays out. I believe in the ripple ecosystem of #XRP #XLM #TRX. #TRX has biggest chance to grow right now.

Bought some herocoin last night. Was just added to coinmarketcap yesterday, decently low/mid supply. Has a huge team and i think making there own niche in the crypto market. $PLAY check them out jeff!

4649 2018-01-01 16:49:49 What’s disheartening is how many people are “investing” in things they don’t understand. The same rule applies to crypto as anything else, “invest” in what you know. Also, stop calling it investing - people are gambling on crypto.
4650 2018-01-01 16:49:45 I'm pissed off about how this release was handled. And I bought 3600 more verge. grrrrrrrrrr
4651 2018-01-01 16:49:43 its good time to enter now its early.
4652 2018-01-01 16:49:36 Agreed. Very rare to be able to know who is legit in this crazy crypto world. Many people are posting about only legit coins but they are few and far between. Others let it get to their ego and pump only for their own profits made from their followers.
4653 2018-01-01 16:49:35 Still trying to figure out what the point of $TRX dogs is. I wasn't around for these crypto kitties you speak of so I'm very lost on these...
4654 2018-01-01 16:49:28 Bitcoin fees are getting totally out of control! #Crypto #BitcoinFutures #BitcoineNelerOluyor #bitcoin #bitcoincrash #BTC #BTCUSD #Cryptocurreny #investing @BitcoinTre @officialmcafee @Omise @BitcoinOfficial @litecoin
4655 2018-01-01 16:49:24 I take it with a grain of salt
4656 2018-01-01 16:49:08 The story will repeat itself again. First BTC to 100k then different alts to 10 USD, 100, 1k and 10-20k range to multiply BTC holdings. 2018 the best year in crypto
4657 2018-01-01 16:48:57 I doubled my investment on the dip LOL. 2018 is going to be a good year for crypto!
4658 2018-01-01 16:48:52 100 JPY(BTC): 1166.062 ~ 1168.586 KRW(BTC)
4659 2018-01-01 16:48:49 Of course they are motivated by money. Greed is the only thing driving crypto.
4660 2018-01-01 16:48:46 traders make money by converting noob pumps of shitcoins into btc. everybody with half a brain knows that bitcoin is the backbone of crypto.
4661 2018-01-01 16:48:39 All true. One of the two coins with the greatest potential. The other being $RUP. In five years, $ARK will be $1000 plus.
4662 2018-01-01 16:48:36 #XRP still worth it?
  #Thought ?
#crypto Its on a dip buy?
4663 2018-01-01 16:48:35 @Sicarious_ i appreciated your time on the crypto street pod. thanks for your insight!
4664 2018-01-01 16:48:11 broke after such expense? is he not in crypto?
4665 2018-01-01 16:48:07 This is a great time to get in Cardano, won’t probably see a price this low again. Double down and get out of your other shitty, non performing ALT coins. You will thank me later.

4669 2018-01-01 16:47:40 What’s your favorite app to check the crypto market prices on?  I’ve been using @CoinCap_io but it’s been getting really glitchy. I have no patience for that because when I want a price, I don’t want to wait. Need recommendations please  #cryptocurrency #cryptocoins
4670 2018-01-01 16:47:34 What’s your charts showing that it can make a bull run towards
4671 2018-01-01 16:47:20 Yes, am totally aware of this.  But U.S. investments make upa  substantial part of crypto investing.  It will have an impact,a nd it is possible other Govs will follow suit.  This opens up a multitude of Game Theory options for how this plays out.
4672 2018-01-01 16:47:15 #bitcoinx4 This is simply the best
4673 2018-01-01 16:47:14 Wrong! #xrp is already being used for sending money! Why others release protocols #Ripple is signing hundred of deals!
4674 2018-01-01 16:46:59 I wouldn't lisiten to the wolf of Wallstreet give me stock tips, so why would I listen to #ver give crypto advice. I don't take advice from those who wanted to gain personally by storing explosives in a residential comply be sold online... Hahaha. Call me old school.
4675 2018-01-01 16:46:52 A friend told me to invest in PROC. I went on your twitter and you are only all about verge. Which i dumped a week ago when it reached an all time high. This gets me worried. Why arent you posting about ProCurrency? I don't think WRAITH is going to happen btw that's why I sold
4676 2018-01-01 16:46:46 RT @BitcoinOpinions: If your coin is currently not going crazy like #factom (thank you @officialmcafee ...) just take comfort in the fact that the #crypto market is still very healthy in general.

4678 2018-01-01 16:46:40 People are saying that it is still early days for blockchain and crypto. I've been trading it for about 3 weeks (newbie) and it's felt like 3 months.

4685 2018-01-01 16:46:18 Stellar will break out mid January. I expect it to hit a dollar  soon. If it does it will be at $3 by February. Let’s go!
4686 2018-01-01 16:46:05 which is best website to trade in crypto currency in India? like ripple eth others not only bitcoin
4687 2018-01-01 16:45:36 That's lame. You claimed there are weaknesses. The burden of proof is on you to back up your claim. I'm happy to Google for other results but you should be able to provide at least one solid reference otherwise you're just FUDing.
4688 2018-01-01 16:45:34 I would think the miners don't care to bankrupt the BTC people all at once. It would be bad for crypto. So they are letting investors know gradually to give people a chance to adjust to other alt coins for the long run.
4689 2018-01-01 16:45:29 if you think XVG is going to go up because of marketcap, market penetration, etc...... you're wrong. What drives crypto is Main Stream Media + FOMO. Most ppl dont look at the technicals when they buy. I still look at the technical/fundamentals

4704 2018-01-01 16:43:48 Im starting to realize that there are alot of stupid people in crypto after experiencing the crazy hype on verge releasing wraithprotocol.

4712 2018-01-01 16:42:54 LBRY more upside potential from where it currently is in the chart.
4713 2018-01-01 16:42:44 Indeed... the rentenmark (if I remember correctly) was based on property but it failed. The Zimbabwean dollar bonds were based on dollars. It failed. Both if those were fiat however. This is crypto... lets see how it works.
4714 2018-01-01 16:42:41 Any folk interested in crypto, it might be worth registering with a good broker in advance as the verification process can take ages, like 2 weeks. Currently awaiting Bitstamp to discern whether I'm a God damn robot.
4715 2018-01-01 16:42:34 Yeah this a major issue for most crypto projects to solve before mainstream end user adoption. Not sure how to solve but @civickey looks like a great approach for identity management.
4716 2018-01-01 16:42:33 Investemens to buy back Coins to burn

4719 2018-01-01 16:42:12 Crypto are the future bro
4720 2018-01-01 16:42:09 any exchange can freeze any crypto held on it in exactly the same way if the government orders it the only way around this is with things like KMDs barter dex decentralised exchanges
4721 2018-01-01 16:42:06 Agree Sir. .completely agree on this..
4722 2018-01-01 16:41:55 Point out one. You should be able to provide at least one.
4723 2018-01-01 16:41:53 Nope, you aren't missing anything and I respect your position.
I just find it really hard for any crypto project to really revolutionize the world and attain true global adoption without going through some form of regulation. Although I would love to have the cake and eat it too

4727 2018-01-01 16:41:14 yes but ripple could not freeze the ledger the gateway could freeze the transaction same as any exchange can freeze the transaction of any crypto. They did this after Jed broke the court order and tried to over sell but they where unable to stop it themselves
4728 2018-01-01 16:41:06 And XLM is way better more decentralised then Xrp

4740 2018-01-01 16:39:52 You need to remember 60% of people investing in crypto have no idea what they are investing in.. following social media and top % rise coins.. xvg is holding a very stable price. That counts for alot.

There's no PAIN like the PAIN of being on the wrong side of a Crypto Trade, and we ALL KNOW THAT!!
4771 2018-01-01 16:35:29 I agree with that, so then the question is, how long will it take? It seems the US government might be several steps behind in calling this out, and new Fed chair unlikely to cause waves/disturb Trump's stock market with crypto crash. Up and to the right for longer?

4778 2018-01-01 16:34:49 It's tough to HODL though, isn't it? I'm the same, day trading is a skill and it completely eludes me. But hodling through the past 24 hours is so tough. I bought a quarter million at .007 and took 6000 euros profit on the high before Xmas. So the rest can stay in no matter what.
4779 2018-01-01 16:34:44 I’m riding this #xvg roller coaster out... not for a profit, for a long term gain because it is everything that crypto stands for.

4782 2018-01-01 16:34:39 so it's not released yet again?
4783 2018-01-01 16:34:33 Selling excc, let me know if you are interested.

4785 2018-01-01 16:34:26 おめでとうございます！(^^)
4786 2018-01-01 16:34:26 I bought in last summer or before. People chasing green candles have no sympathy from me, too many new people in crypto for all the wrong reasons. But they do create good profits for the rest of us so keep the lambs coming 
4787 2018-01-01 16:34:23 The only way I see to compete against that . Is corporations built solely for the propose of generating liquidity in crypto with a total supply . Preventing inflation is key here. Ripple is subject to inflation. I would like to be involved if you get read this.
4788 2018-01-01 16:34:22 If your coin is currently not going crazy like #factom (thank you @officialmcafee ...) just take comfort in the fact that the #crypto market is still very healthy in general.

4797 2018-01-01 16:33:20 They have to decoy themselves as likable since it's basically the institutions which the crypto community in itself is afraid of as it implicates more power to the regulators.  If the majority of the institutions own XRP, then who's the winner. The user or the issuer?
4798 2018-01-01 16:33:06 Geez!
4799 2018-01-01 16:33:03 Add a liver to it. Not the organ.

4805 2018-01-01 16:32:05 $DRGN reached over $2 today. Just the start. My goodness.
4806 2018-01-01 16:31:55 I was just wondering, wish you the best in the crypto world. I’ve definitely moved my assets to crypto as well so i totally understand
4807 2018-01-01 16:31:52 I bought Amazon Echo for Christmas. I just searched for skills under “Business & Finance” section. Almost all relate to bitcoin and other crypto currencies. Draw your own conclusions...
4808 2018-01-01 16:31:50 These goofs are like the browns of crypto. O-H
4809 2018-01-01 16:31:40 というか、全部利確すれば税金の計算ラクって言いつつ、コレクターみたいにアルトコイン集めてる人だと相当大変じゃないか？イーサリアムとかBCHに換えて、zaifに送って円に換えるとか、BTCに換えて国内の取引所に送って円に換えるとか？でまた全部戻すの…？ #仮想通貨税金

4811 2018-01-01 16:31:28 Trading with a set of rules is easy. Finding out which rules work for you is the hard part.

Stay on your journey. This is the greatest opportunity for you to learn the markets, because everything moves faster in #crypto.
4812 2018-01-01 16:31:14 Some ppl have no business investing in crypto. Everyone looking to get rich quick and when a coin fails to make them wealthy they label it a scam.
4813 2018-01-01 16:31:10 If you really need to get ahold of them apparently they are very responsive through Telegram
4814 2018-01-01 16:31:05 Clearly their marketers, if they have any, weren't working. You know what a marketer is right?
4815 2018-01-01 16:31:05 There already exist a lot of other altcoins which have better concepts and software designs (@ethereumproject @Ripple @LTCFoundation @monerocurrency, just to name a few). Bitcoin is "just" the first crypto, the proof of concept and ATM (I'm afraid) only a speculative investment.
4816 2018-01-01 16:30:53 My guesses are DRGN or STORM :)
4817 2018-01-01 16:30:49 どうしてコイン同士の取引を利確扱いにしちゃったんだろうなぁ… #仮想通貨税金

4820 2018-01-01 16:30:27 Decentralized exchanges will be the future but it's going to take time for their volume/liquidity to reach approachable levels for most folks.
4821 2018-01-01 16:30:20 Does it even work? You lost me with the spotty releases. Amateurishness at its worst
4822 2018-01-01 16:30:20 Thank you mate! I will heed your advice, doing a cyber security degree I really should use a VM more often, maybe that can be my resolution. Very Happy New Year to ya :)
4823 2018-01-01 16:30:17 The smoother functioning of the state-run protocols for actual payments and price stability, as well as the heavy hand of state intervention, drives a decreasing interest in all cryptocurrencies and completely sidelines the Bitcoin and crypto phenomenon from a price speculation!
4824 2018-01-01 16:30:15 Coinbase to mercatox = heavy transaction fees that gdax would avoid. I just sent £5 and it charged £10 transaction fee I nearly cried haha 
4825 2018-01-01 16:30:14 Venezuela government is just criminal. I know a couple of people in jail over there because of crypto mining and/or trading. Accusing them of "cyber terrorism".

4829 2018-01-01 16:30:05 I did! (Barat2000 on Instagram )
4830 2018-01-01 16:30:02 Without an crypto exchange? LOL
4831 2018-01-01 16:29:59 Just bought my first crypto Tee last night, it’s #cardano of course!!!
4832 2018-01-01 16:29:59 So my thoughts are, of course xrp ( ripple ) is going up . They are centralized Banks that are pouring money into their coin. 1 they have no cap and control the circulating supply. 2 .They have been documented buying up massive amounts of other crypto. They claim  for ransomware.
4833 2018-01-01 16:29:59 How many $emb are you holding ?

4834 2018-01-01 16:29:57 これだけアルトコインブームですが、アルトコインの入手はやはり難易度が高い。海外取引所でBTC建とかで買ったり、Changellyを使うと税金の計算が無理ゲー化する。唯一、一部のアルトコインが板取引できるのがzaifですが、本人確認が1か月待ちとか。 #仮想通貨税金
4835 2018-01-01 16:29:57 Gonna start off the year by loading up on $SQ calls. Took a beating during the latest crypto crash and end of year dip. Once they become profitable these prices will be a gift. #morditrades #SQ #squarecash #cashapp #option-trading #stocks.

4843 2018-01-01 16:28:48 特に吹き上げ要因（マカ的な煽り）も無く、爆上げが突然来たので、コミュニティはザワつきながらワクワクです。

4844 2018-01-01 16:28:41 it is possible.. look at xrp.. a lot said that it would not go $1
4845 2018-01-01 16:28:34 And lots made a loss too count yourself fortunate
4846 2018-01-01 16:28:18 イーサがマイニングリグのROI は今の価格で大体10ヶ月だけど、早いと踏んでます。イーサが掘れなくなったらハイスペＰＣ組んだり、グラボ売ったり、他の通貨掘ったりできるしね！

4854 2018-01-01 16:27:30 すごい！！！そんなことあるんですか！！
4855 2018-01-01 16:27:22 CB could be pushing forward the crypto space astronomically if only they hadn't been blinded by greed along the way. 

Think of how easily they could onboard LN and help the rest of the world adopt it. They could *easily* be the biggest LN hub in the space!

4923 2018-01-01 16:19:59 The more I talk to crypto whales the more I believe that the crypto market crash (2018?) will be the heyday of stablecoins and "crypto majors" (BTC, maybe ETH). The money won't go into USD because whales won't want to deal with the authorities and iffy bank transfers

4936 2018-01-01 16:19:01 One of the biggest scams in crypto industry.

4942 2018-01-01 16:18:32 Get out of crypto if this worries you. Or you will go mad! Not joking.
4943 2018-01-01 16:18:18 I don’t have #fearofdieing but I am afraid that I will die without no one else in my family knowing where my #privatekeys. You earn so much but if it cannot be used its uselsess. Its hard but its true... no one is #immortal

4944 2018-01-01 16:18:13 Omg! Your tweet made it go up! You must be a crypto expert! It goes up and down all fucking day long you dumb ass!
4945 2018-01-01 16:18:10 Trop cool :) merci
4946 2018-01-01 16:18:02 Windows Qt wallet is available. We have integrated tor into our core repository. Today we will be adding it to the Makefiles and then pushing another update.
4947 2018-01-01 16:17:53 do you mean like verge also? hype misleading people leading up to the new year and just after, they milked the shit out of loads of people. I will happily stick with in crypto I trust, Bitcoin.
4948 2018-01-01 16:17:50 My bad, didn't check when you registered. Most Bcash shills have older accounts but only started talking about bitcoin/bch/crypto in late 2017 while claiming to be 'early-adopters'.
4949 2018-01-01 16:17:42 Same here...hope we will be rewarded in longterm..

4954 2018-01-01 16:16:53 In $crypto there is no right or wrong, nor good or bad. It is what it is. You can take advantage of anything, even if it's up or down. Nothing is "bad", not even corrections.
4955 2018-01-01 16:16:48 yes, what does this tweet mean in English?
4956 2018-01-01 16:16:39 Glad to hear that, i'm long term in $ARK very good project....

4959 2018-01-01 16:16:17 Here's the one thing you are forgetting:  Coinbase is ripe for disruption.  They might have a virtual monopoly on credit-card low friction sales to crypto newbies, but if they don't innovate and improve someone is going to come along and turn them into Blockbuster video.
4960 2018-01-01 16:16:12 Where is xvgwhaled

4963 2018-01-01 16:15:43 most talked about crypto coin and its going to be .50$ sooner .......
4964 2018-01-01 16:15:41 Hmmm I bet you can’t even make a gmail account without a YouTube tutorial so you may not understand how these things works!  Go back were you belong leave crypto
4965 2018-01-01 16:15:37 Yes !! Vcash marketing was terrible!! But last year, Some Brazilians smarter than me .... convinced me to invest in this coin. @traderminer for example .. he is top here .. I am just a curious person .. #crypto is the future and I am all in ! #vcash $xvc

4981 2018-01-01 16:14:08 もう何も信じられない...チャートもSNSも......
4982 2018-01-01 16:14:04 This is by design. The most promising use for crypto currencies is as money. No one wants to complete with Bitcoin, but Bitcoin has attracted a lot of dumb money. Something has to sponge up the slop. Enter every single altcoin.
4983 2018-01-01 16:14:03 if you had taken the time to read their 'about' page, you would know they NEVER mention being a CRYPTO NEWS show.  Who need to look perfect just to make a few videos?  they are 2 of the nicest & credible guys i know - and I am now wealthy thanks to them. Don't be so stuck-up!
4984 2018-01-01 16:13:58 There are many cowboys in this crypto game. Many followers does not = credibility!! Be careful.

4986 2018-01-01 16:13:47 When you receive your ignis, the price will have fallen to 0.30 centime is the law
4987 2018-01-01 16:13:43 Is that like Comic Con but a bunch of economists and crypto currency nerds dressed up as different types of currency and then they secretly hook up with each other after drinking lots of greyhounds? Sounds awesome.
4988 2018-01-01 16:13:36 It is fake for sure! Al the double ip's and wrong data. Way to little transactions to be true. Im not even seeing my own transactions i did 30 minutes ago to my wallet. Dont believe al the FUD. Way to many people want to bring down #VergeCoin . Just #HODL
4989 2018-01-01 16:13:32 Been hodling this for a while now.. Hope it plays off @Crypto_Ed_NL

4992 2018-01-01 16:13:03 I was trying to find it but apparently she deleted it somebody tagged her in a tweet with the profile of the actual person whose photos she's using and then was like Christina or something
4993 2018-01-01 16:13:00 So did everybody have a good time going into 2018?
I hope so 
Now back to Crypto, and making our money work for us.

Already stoked to hear what $EMB will become. News Update out in approximately 2 hours.

Also very exited about $HOLD. Q1 of 2018 on their roadmap looks good.

4995 2018-01-01 16:12:49 I am only using twitter to get up to date with all the crypto stuff... you guys loosing trust with changing the rules during the contest. 100 followers is BS imo...

5044 2018-01-01 16:07:44 My philosophy with investing in crypto coins: 
You either eat instant noodles, or lobster. There is no in between 

In all seriousness, don't invest what you can't afford. And if you do.. be ready for #InstantNoodleLife.

5079 2018-01-01 16:04:59 I pre-judged TBC based on liberal criticism when it was first published. In 1996, someone challenged me to actually READ it. Not at all "crypto-eugenics" or "pseudo-science."
5080 2018-01-01 16:04:56 Think the crypto markets will rise tomorrow? Fresh money coming into the game?
5081 2018-01-01 16:04:54 My $BTC Crypto prediction for 2018 is major corrections and lack of interest. 
I bet the excitement, the gold rush, is over- even for altcoins like $LTC. No more 1800% gains. It was fun while it lasted though.
5082 2018-01-01 16:04:54 What did you buy today? #BTC #LTC #ETH #BCH or other/none?

5087 2018-01-01 16:04:41 In order to sell etn they will have to create accounts on excanges, maybe some will start investing into crypto or in etn. The coins dumped won't make any difference in the price as people will earn a few coins, not a fortune

5106 2018-01-01 16:03:26 Thanks John. Some will call this market manipulation (which it essentially is), but that's where crypto is at right now. Eventually, there will be some internal regulation, but right now it's the Wild West. If nothing else, this will be one for hodling. Follow? :)
5107 2018-01-01 16:03:18 Locked up  they are using them to entice investors and release more into circulation every month. 

It's no different to fiat currency printing money

5112 2018-01-01 16:02:38 2 days before BTC fell to 11k I said it's going to 10K and it was near it's 19K high at the time, next prediction was XRP the two biggest moves in crypto I called move on moron
5113 2018-01-01 16:02:20 Thank you for sharing your story Luke. You are one of my favorite accouns! It's Twitter where I found inspiration this year. Crypto is the foundation of a better world.
5114 2018-01-01 16:02:15 When talking about crypto, I personally prefer to use "transition into" rather than "invest in" - for me it seems more accurate rn.
5115 2018-01-01 16:01:57 That's kind of my plan too. But instead of a Ferrari I would buy me a  Bentley XD
5116 2018-01-01 16:01:28 too late to add?
5117 2018-01-01 16:01:25 That's why I got thousands of followers and you have 10 moron. I've been discussing crypto for ages and doing it for 5 decades. Move on pissant.
5118 2018-01-01 16:01:17 Sabbateans and Seveners (like later Frankists) were officially founded by Jewish and crypto-Jewish occultists, their true origins lie in ancient times with elusive Gaonim or Gaonate. Gaonim - themselves high-degree Atonists - referred themselves as Exilarchs or Princes of Light

5123 2018-01-01 16:00:52 It isn't Sarah. It's when LIN/WIN Ver. are also released. A 33% release isn't a Release. It's merely a beta. [of the release] AND! If the Private ledger is established . which atm isn't the case - But anyway it'll drop today, tomorrow, we'll see.
5124 2018-01-01 16:00:41 Yes, it will act as a way of getting new people into the crypto market by giving free etn for leaving the app open in the background, simulating mining. In this way, more and more people will start being interested in crypto

5142 2018-01-01 15:58:45 True. You’re connected with the whose who of the #crypto world. I was wondering if there’s more to read in between the lines. Or maybe it’s too early for me in the day and I need my ‘covfefe’.
5143 2018-01-01 15:58:32 He's asleep from a long night. I doubt this is real and probably just more fud.
5144 2018-01-01 15:58:26 When humans become extraordinarily wealthy over a short period of time - they can get really weird. I wish Coinbase had decent goals, governance and leadership. Seems like they are steering the good ship Crypto into the reefs.
5145 2018-01-01 15:58:18 Fair enough. Everyone has different approaches, I like a diverse portfolio, but that isn't the only way. Best of luck with your #crypto journey!

5149 2018-01-01 15:57:54 You literally linked something that explains why you should be able to send send from a stealth address to a public one. So how am I wrong here?
5150 2018-01-01 15:57:50 Not defined yet, still looking. But I'll most likely tour around the world this year to take a look around :)
5151 2018-01-01 15:57:37 The market changed after the Dimon dip. A new investor entered the space thr Coinbase. Price dislocated from current utility. Correction coming. Noobs have weak hands. Hate to say it but $XRP might benefit as a safe haven crypto during the fall. Especially if CB adds.
5152 2018-01-01 15:57:33 了解しました(^-^)
5153 2018-01-01 15:57:27 Drama is good in crypto. It makes a coin more popular. Too many haters tho'

5173 2018-01-01 15:55:43 So you linked something that verifies what I'm saying, thank you. They haven't released #WraithProtocol  What they described doesn't exist today.
5174 2018-01-01 15:55:35 It was released and they are still up on the 1st of Jan, working on it. Learn how to do some research. Next time you invest in something

5193 2018-01-01 15:53:43 Sir, I'm confused. So a ban on cash would result in... what? No actual physical paper? Wouldn't crypto be the reason that gets CBs off the hook with debt? So in other words, CBs embrace crypto and just erase national debts?
5194 2018-01-01 15:53:23 Do you have a top 5 crypto for 2018? thx

5201 2018-01-01 15:52:56 What's with the new tax laws on crypto currency? Can someone provide me better insight?
5202 2018-01-01 15:52:56 I got to admit. #BitcoinCash looks a lot more like the #bitcoins that got me interested in the crypto space than #bitcoincore.
5203 2018-01-01 15:52:53 My new year is not like a new year..feel like I am on a death bed. .:( developers can't work 24/7. They need some rest too..eagerly waiting for Windows update
5204 2018-01-01 15:52:47 You’re the best crypto follow out there. Thank you for all you do.
5205 2018-01-01 15:52:39 Tgats my mentality too, after I buy crypto I consider the fiat gone.
5206 2018-01-01 15:52:39 I completely agree with this statement John. For me personally, DeepOnion is one of the top privacy coins out there. The devs are working really hard to bring the best features to the crypto world like DeepVault (already released) and DeepSend.The Roadmap is really promising too!
5207 2018-01-01 15:52:33 Comprar esa Crypto es apoyar a un asesino canalla...

5209 2018-01-01 15:52:30 Citi bank calls and says if I do anymore transactions on international crypto currency exchanges they will suspend my account. Only goes to prove that money needs to move away from banks' control 
5210 2018-01-01 15:52:25 mcafee said crypto is bigger than the adoption of agriculture lol.
5211 2018-01-01 15:52:18 Well then, wat more than is sensible. But made it due crypto. Might as well risk it for crypto too

5218 2018-01-01 15:51:35 おめでとうございます〜
5219 2018-01-01 15:51:28 Crypto should only be traded - not invested
5220 2018-01-01 15:51:11 Fragmented crypto community = the new decentralised future. We need to start feeling comfortable with this new 'normal'!!!!
5221 2018-01-01 15:51:07 You deserve a rest, manipulating markets takes a lot out of you. XVG has done more to bring gov't regulations to crypto's than I think you realize. It's been very interesting to watch this poor mans pump and dump scheme, but it goes to show why we reg the financial system.
5222 2018-01-01 15:51:02 My new years resolution to get into crypto and make some money from it haha, not jus bitcoin. I already own some bitcoin tho haha
5223 2018-01-01 15:50:50 Cheaper than Crypto Kitties, 4 Gen-0's will set you back over $200, and there are people selling the rare kittens for 6-figures already. So if it functions kind of the same way, $40 gets the ball rolling and lets you make money. Early adopters and the lucky make the most.
5224 2018-01-01 15:50:48 You are misled, but it's understandable. My advice is to expect your crypto to work, expect your information to be delivered fairly, and make your own judgments on facts you verify yourself.

5226 2018-01-01 15:50:39 Pretty hard to think to shift your gear without punching the clutch. I bet I would press my left foot against the bottom of the car anyway when trying to shift xD

5228 2018-01-01 15:50:26 I'm so tired of this $XVG drama! Looking at $MOON and $HTML while they're going up fast! Nice profits to be made! 5x on #HTML and 2x on #MOON in the past week only! Gotta love the #crypto world!  @HTMLCOIN @_Mooncoin

5246 2018-01-01 15:48:40 Mr Silbert, if i may take some minutes of your time. Trying to decrypt crypto market ... Not so easy ! I know that you are involved with @DCGco & indirectly with @coinbase ! Do you think that ETC is going to make it before XRP on coinbase ?

It was my first time in crypto. It's hard to lose 25%
5264 2018-01-01 15:47:29 Bitcoin because due to its success so many people jumped into crypto. Can’t think of anyone who got into crypto because of $LTC

5270 2018-01-01 15:46:51 I have to say this crypto-currency platform is brilliant and really worth getting involved with, I first registered on November 21st 2017 and have since tripled my origional investment and have earnt 275 dollars in only 40 days interest, its so simple but effective
5271 2018-01-01 15:46:50 たまに攻撃されて傷ついているので追い打ちはやめましょう。
5272 2018-01-01 15:46:46 To all the Crypto noobs in the world. Please don't just jump into the coin which @officialmcafee suggests. Check the day chart before you get in. the coins are already pumped and you are just getting manipulated. You will loose money if you are not smart.
5273 2018-01-01 15:46:39 Funny realisation:

While @Ripple and $XRP are considered the “Evil Empire” by alot of $BTC purists, 
the $XRP community contains some of the most wise, loving, openminded and intelligent people of the entire $Crypto crowd on Twitter

Go figure...
5274 2018-01-01 15:46:31 It also provides a means for others to trade with them. China has outlawed crypto currencies & has no US exchange rate risk because they’re virtually pegged.

5276 2018-01-01 15:46:23 Of course it hides users IP. Tor does that . The locations this website is showing is the IP that is being routed through tor. Meaning the orginal users IP isn't shown. Also every other crypto shows the users real ip

5281 2018-01-01 15:45:46 Ah bah voilà je viens de répondre sous l'autre tweet ^^
5282 2018-01-01 15:45:43 No this is not similar to bitconnect at all. They give real cash loans and hold your crypto, where bitconnect "lending" is just you giving your crypto to some fake bot that will eventually screw you over.
5283 2018-01-01 15:45:41 2017 was the calm before the storm when automated feedback loops were designed. In 2018 we'll see what happens when those loops close on a mass scale i.e. AI, crypto, Robo-advisory, and your fave phenomenon Trumpism
5284 2018-01-01 15:45:19 Pro priv coins as a whole, pick your fav or select a few based on DD. If the whole crypto world goes away tomorrow priv coins will still have a place. Somewhere someone wants to buy a liver or move a Kilo.

5320 2018-01-01 15:41:52 Basically a dude who's been around crypto for a while and was one of the first to use TA I guess. He tries to act like he invented TA because other people obviously started using it too after he did. He's good at TA but his personality is not worth it lol
5321 2018-01-01 15:41:50 I guess nothing is impossible.. jz we need bunch of people to invest.. then it’s rocket to moon 
5322 2018-01-01 15:41:38 I cant continue this anymore ))) even my girlfriend doesnt eat my brain so hard
5323 2018-01-01 15:41:29 I have no intention of buying one so soon. I'm more interested in moving out of my country first
5324 2018-01-01 15:41:27 しかし、200万円が遠くなったなぁ…あと、12/22に20万円台で買えて喜んでたBCH下がってきたな、まぁいいけど…
5325 2018-01-01 15:41:14 BTCが下げると不安感からか、アルトがそれ以上に下げるんだよな

5328 2018-01-01 15:40:35 Just accelerator and brake pedals. Shift gear with the butterfly thingy behind the wheel without the need of a clutch. I think all Ferraris 458 Italia are like that, no?
5329 2018-01-01 15:40:27 I bought it at less then 11 cents and sold at 25.. So sad how you try to take stabs when you're proven wrong. You haven't disputed a single point, you've just tried to throw shade and failed.

5337 2018-01-01 15:39:22 I strongly suggest looking into Cardano (ADA). Run by Charles Hoskinson...formerly of ETH. He has assembled a mammoth worldwide team to solve debilitating long term problems with ETH & BTC. Coin has doubled to .70 in past month. This coin is the future of crypto.
5338 2018-01-01 15:39:15 Haven't looked at it yet.

5348 2018-01-01 15:38:07 Not yet, but i will. And i don’t think you understand how things work in the world not just crypto. Price always depends on the product and the team behind it. The team behind the product needs to be a little bit more ambitious and not to depend on community support.

5351 2018-01-01 15:37:35 Either way...now has the potential to crash the financial system. Banning  crypto could set off a widespread panic about the frailty of the financial system....and clearly prove to enough people why their financial “assets” are unsound.
5352 2018-01-01 15:37:17 I'm still bullish. I had a large position... Got in early. Took x5 profits.
5353 2018-01-01 15:37:11 And if you had read any of the so-called "post-modernists" or any of the Marxist criticisms of "post-modernism" you would know this.
5354 2018-01-01 15:37:06 Start with some crypto kitties and then move on to crypto kids when you are ready... then sell them all!
5355 2018-01-01 15:37:04 Absolutely, If you bought it for wraith and sold it because it didn't come out 12 hours ago your new to crypto. New buyers doing #FOMO and me #HODL is how I've made huge returns in crypto. #verge #xvg for life!
5356 2018-01-01 15:37:04 Speculation and opinion at this time.... no one really knows the outcome to this crypto journey!
5357 2018-01-01 15:36:49 おめでとう御座います！

5358 2018-01-01 15:36:38 You would hold credibility if you weren’t pushing xvg - the biggest scam coin going
5359 2018-01-01 15:36:36 But yeah keep saying I don't understand how it works when you don't understand the technology behind it. Enjoy your dogecoin dark.
5360 2018-01-01 15:36:29 That he is. I know this goes on with other crypto currencies just seems to be happening more with this one.
5361 2018-01-01 15:36:21 I have a small system in place to make sure I take some profits off the #crypto table and get some value every month. I'm supporting at least one @Kickstarter project, the rest goes to my development fund (books, courses, etc.).
5362 2018-01-01 15:36:20 In fact Foucault is quite clear about this. Now of course there are a lot of ways that post-structuralist thought has been borrowed, shorn from its foundations, by people in the Marxist camp but there there is not something called "post-modern neo-marxism" that is an actual thing

5364 2018-01-01 15:36:08 Up 186% from 43BTC, What a pump that was!
5365 2018-01-01 15:36:06 You know what though...At some point diversification needs to be evaluated. If we are fully diversified in every damn coin you will get market returns. This whole crypto world is nuts and making concentrated bets on something you firmly believe in based on DD can pay off huge.

5369 2018-01-01 15:35:54 Happy 2018 to everyone!  #mobilemarketing and #crypto brought me back to twitter in 2017 and it was a great year!

5376 2018-01-01 15:35:18 Wraith protocol was suppose to allow for private and public transactions within the same blockchain? Lets see it in action. If wraith protocol was working you should be able to send a payment from a stealth address to a normal address. Lets see it.
5377 2018-01-01 15:35:16 Yes it is quite clear if you study it and I study it. First of all post-modernism isn't a thing unless you are Lyotard (it's post-structuralism); secondly, it was a reaction to Marxism (which was the hallmark of critical modernism) and rejection of its claims to grand narratives

Make the $CRYPTO community save money on accountant fees and too much tax. 

Most important of all, to still enjoy every moment of being part of this community.

5387 2018-01-01 15:33:43 This is an opportune time to popularise decentralised exchanges where individuals can buy and sell crypto's without the KYC requirements (amongst other things) which cause delays when interest spikes. Cut the middleman out.
5388 2018-01-01 15:33:42 I never drove a car without a clutch before, it was my first, so there's that. It's amazing tho

もしくはBTCの値段がある程度安定したらあり得るフェイズなのかなーって感じてます。

5411 2018-01-01 15:30:38 If you had nxt on bittrex at around 7pm mountain standard time when the snap shot was taken then you will get your ignis when bittrex secures the ignis wallet. It may take a day or two. It is a holiday so probably tomorrow we will have ignis coins.

5414 2018-01-01 15:30:14 For no reason other than one link lead to another the first articles I read about in 2018 were crypto-currency and end to end encryption. Crazy “data” technologies.
5415 2018-01-01 15:30:11 Floating around my crowded keppe for 2018:

1. Political trap door for markets (1H18?)

2. Big-time regulatory disruption in crypto

3. Global adoption of medical #cannabis

4. Multi-year high for the markets put in.

Note: Nobody *knows;* this pure conjecture.

5422 2018-01-01 15:29:26 To understand crypto assets one needs to study both economics and software. Otherwise, one can be easily misled by a naive scam.
5423 2018-01-01 15:29:17 どう言う事か分かりましたか？
5424 2018-01-01 15:29:16 Which is the best crypto to invest in right now?
5425 2018-01-01 15:29:10 So...who didn't go to bed with worries about $IGNIS trading going live on @BittrexExchange or other exchanges? Not this guy! I knew there was little to no chance of trading to begin and even if it did, the bid will be nowhere near the futures value. #GoToBed

5433 2018-01-01 15:28:20 We can’t say anything that deterministic as supply is not constrained. 

It is still an important factor in determining the future price of various fiat currencies that crypto assets lack. (The analogous persistent demand for crypto is from people who need to pay off hackers...)

5436 2018-01-01 15:27:57 The silver lining in crypto is that most of these people are content with very little.
5437 2018-01-01 15:27:54 It think it's OK to be psychologically "All In" on crypto/blockchain as concepts.  But to be financially "All In" on any one thing is crazy.

5454 2018-01-01 15:26:21 Yo. Happy New Year!   I’m gonna lock down my #Ignis until 2019.    All of these crypto prices are deflated.   No one has a clue how much money is coming in or what this stuff is worth.   People are selling ZCash for under $500.  
5455 2018-01-01 15:26:16 Guess I'm more bullish then
5456 2018-01-01 15:26:13 I think ppl generally like crypto shills until the dumpenings
5457 2018-01-01 15:26:10 Going to start with 5 but the idea is have plenty of room for expansion to mine other crypto as well.
5458 2018-01-01 15:26:02 kindly Stop the game @officialmcafee of pump and dump people are losing money like any thing.
5459 2018-01-01 15:26:02 ShitLiranSays now he just gotta hold for next several days for few weeks. his $BTC will tied now.

利点は、下記二つ。
フォークした事によって、いろんな取引所に上場している流動性。
BTCの問題に対して比較対象になって評価される事。

この２点をどれだけ評価するか。ただしBTCの問題もいずれ解決されるだろう…

5510 2018-01-01 15:22:40 There is. I wouldnt give worthless hope. Announcement is one thing but important thing is #xrp will have much much return. It's not worth switching coin to coin, it's risky and stressful. People in crypto can t sleep when price fall or even if it rise. #xrp will give peace.

5517 2018-01-01 15:21:47 Where is proof he can pull it off? Can it be done? 

I invested. Lost a lot so far. I don't want to lose it all.

It doesnt work and developers agree that the code doesnt look good. Patches everywhere :(

5527 2018-01-01 15:20:57 Manipulation by people like @officialmcafee is the reason regulation will come down harder on crypto. Really John - you don’t have enough $$, you need to pull stunts like this???

5533 2018-01-01 15:20:43 I would add to your predictions Fred two of my own.
1. 2018 will be a year when government and geopolitics started to play more prominent role in crypto currencies. Looking forward specifically to G20 and the French proposal to synchronize regulation.
5534 2018-01-01 15:20:43 Binance, es un excelente exchange para crypto's

5539 2018-01-01 15:20:11 You can't even spell half the words you're attempting to spell, but yet you justify a currency completely lying to their investors comparing it to the security of a social network?
5540 2018-01-01 15:20:08 お、何か暗号通貨はまだ個人の知恵の持ち寄って知恵が積みあがって積み上がっている段階のように感じますし、是非参考にさせていただけるとありがたいです～

5548 2018-01-01 15:19:37 Verge is the Lavar Ball of crypto currencies. People either love it or hate it, but at the end of the day everyone is talking about it.

5557 2018-01-01 15:18:38 Hopefully some faith can be restored over time. Their actual work is great (when it works) but we have to think what are we investing in? The product or the people ... I know I’m still holding my XVG for years to come.

5579 2018-01-01 15:16:37 I don't know about you but that sounds like a lie. Don't be delusional. The whole crypto world watching them many people post lined their new years for them to roll out that pile of shit and press it in investors faces. It's funny, shoulda listened to the trolls .

5583 2018-01-01 15:16:21 dear mother see's me online at ghastly hours and is thankful I have a social life. No mother,  crypto does not sleep.
5584 2018-01-01 15:16:10 If ur concerned with $600 then you shouldnt be investing in #Crypto .  Dont obsess over it-Set an alert on ur ph at the price you want to sell & forget about it. If you cant do this, put your $ into a platform like #bitconnect or #hashflare & watch it grow
5585 2018-01-01 15:16:02 I'm starting a crypto currency club where we sit around and light money on fire.
5586 2018-01-01 15:15:54 聞かれたら投げてます。ありがとうございます。
5587 2018-01-01 15:15:42  people that buy crypto currency have short term views. Cause everybody think they’re going to be rich quick. They couldn’t explain anything that is real
5588 2018-01-01 15:15:40 根かな、肥料かな…？
5589 2018-01-01 15:15:39 $XVG I don't get why people are saying be patient and it's not that bad that it's delayed.... Wtf. Why make a deadline if you know you can't hit it? Especially when it was already delayed twice before?
This is the kind of bs that gives crypto a bad name.
5590 2018-01-01 15:15:32 Happy New Year All.  There will be some new feature updates for @trollboxio coming soon. Looking forward to see what 2018 brings for crypto. 
5591 2018-01-01 15:15:27 Total # of crypto currency is almost 1369. So u ranked #3 among #1369. @SatoshiLite u rocks! Wanna see u at #1 at podium #litecoin #ltc rocks!
5592 2018-01-01 15:15:27 What She's sayin' : Can you just run TOR on ur own : "The DeepOnion is an anonymous encrypted electronic currency integrated with the TOR network" : TOR is NOT ENCRYPTED : Explain how SOME TOR nodes might be compromised : Don't fall for the OkeeDoke : Poor Noobs : #crypto
5593 2018-01-01 15:15:17 Curious what the crypto tax implications are for the following illustrative scenario (which I imagine is very common, especially for people who got in before the insane BTC rally):
5594 2018-01-01 15:15:08 Perhaps the worst miss of this #crypto rise is #xrb. Rail blocks has been rising like hell. @Cointelegraph @CryptoCoinsNews @CryptoEye111 @BitcoinMagazine @_XRB_

5604 2018-01-01 15:13:59 90%?

You should really consider diversifying.  That’s not good.
5605 2018-01-01 15:13:59 Reddit lol
5606 2018-01-01 15:13:58 Really good list, thanks for sharing it here. From all these good coins, @DeepOnionx is my all time favorite. The devs are highly active and keep on releasing awesome privacy features like DeepVault and DeepSend (completely anonymous transactions). This crypto is going to be big!

5616 2018-01-01 15:13:05 The day there will be a law it's the day crypto dies.
5617 2018-01-01 15:13:04 I'm not in it for quick returns. I'm happy holding my coins for the years to come bec I'm confident in the tech. However, it's also the team behind any #crypto that plays a huge role in any coins success. So make sure to research both!  #xvg #xrp #hodl #2018hodlchallenge

5620 2018-01-01 15:12:49 you really need to stop. these mini posts does not help.
5621 2018-01-01 15:12:43 $XVG has to be the most simultaneously hyped and fudded coin in crypto existence.  I love it.
5622 2018-01-01 15:12:43 In BTC = 7.7 to repair building for bussines, but I will never leave crypto
5623 2018-01-01 15:12:31 My suggestion would be learn the crypto market before investing. If you think ripple will stay down then you've made yourself a loss. Although it's not a loss until you sell right?
5624 2018-01-01 15:12:27 How u feel about PAY and MCO? They look ready to boom
5625 2018-01-01 15:12:23 In 2017, the best scam crypto blockchain-less coin was arguably IOTA. IOTA’s CEO willingly allowed the fake news of its Microsoft partnership to flourish, while prices rose over 100% last month. #Cryptocurreny #CryptoNews #cryptotrading #cryptotrader

5649 2018-01-01 15:10:56 Rumor has it wraith protocol doesn’t provide the stealth technology promised. Hope @vergecurrency and @justinvendetta will provide the community with reassurance.

5659 2018-01-01 15:09:44 Due diligence, careful research and controlled risk will point out the opportunities! At the minute their are so many known unknowns that it's all a punt, for me having crypto is about having equity and skin in the game forcing me to deeply delve & learn at the underlying tech :)

5685 2018-01-01 15:07:46 amarettoさんを見習って、わたしもブログとか書いてみようかな〜。
でも難しいことは書けないので、わたしがどのように納税額を算出したかとか、どうやって確定申告するかとか、素人目線で^^

それでは、おやすみなさい〜☆
5686 2018-01-01 15:07:45 and I would add DYOR: do your own research
5687 2018-01-01 15:07:40 
5688 2018-01-01 15:07:40 So this is what this is all about. In this case, the issue should be treated at the core instead of threating the symptoms. Popularise women who influenced the field, teach in school that it used to be a femally dominated job, create books like "programming for slow men", etc.

5690 2018-01-01 15:07:35 Are we talking about H.R.3708? I'm a #bitcoin trader and I don't think it's as bad as you make it. I think it will slow the whales from manipulating the crypto market as they move from one coin into another. Doesn't the $600 de minimis exemption mean we don't report small trades?

5702 2018-01-01 15:05:56 Total crypto market cap has  gone down since BTCs correction,  none of these alt coins are bringing in new money into the market place.  When BTC started dropping a lot of just left all together and the rest is just Money that was in btc being shuffled around between shit coins.

5716 2018-01-01 15:04:24 I'll admit, crypto is fun but its frustrating to lose with high hopes, while others may win with having extras to buy dips and sitting healthy for the finale of WP, while sitting on the edge to buy buy buy. It's all a risk that can go either way. Let's all experience the win! :)
5717 2018-01-01 15:04:09 today is not only the new year but the lauch day of a new safe, legal biz on crypto.

5732 2018-01-01 15:02:47 @davidgokhshtein this botched release has two teaching points: 1. Not everyone can write code, but not everyone can run a business either...solid PR is important 2.

Fact is, @Blockstream does not control bitcoin and the codebase is open source.... So how is VC investment in a company equate to a "take over" of bitcoin?
It doesn't, so this is FUD.

5783 2018-01-01 14:59:10 I believe and understand. But we are in crypto for the money right? So with more than an annual salary invested in $DGB, and it is not moving, i am starting to think is it worth the wait. Anyway appreciate the advice, but for some it doesn’t apply :)

5785 2018-01-01 14:59:04 I HODL, I don't sell under $1 and I don't care when it will be achieved.
5786 2018-01-01 14:59:00 Great Idea with the Hackathon. Looking forward to Good ideas and results Build on NEM Blockchain. #nem #xem #crypto #altcoin #catapult #catapult #hackathon
5787 2018-01-01 14:58:59 But when buying at ATHs and when crypto is so volatile, sometimes waiting for a dip can make a 20% difference. Not worth it if you're just long on it?
5788 2018-01-01 14:58:55 Well, maybe for you as a day trader. no doubt. I am not, and 5000% profit in less than a year is just awesome. Different point of view, as always.. And I am very confident #XVG will grow even more. But well, I can live with it like it is already. #XRP the same btw ;)

5796 2018-01-01 14:58:28 When making trades in crypto for crp/btc am i betting that btc goes down or does this have no factor can both btc and xrp both go up 20% at same time in this position xrp/btc
5797 2018-01-01 14:58:19 なるほど
BTCよりはXRPの方が、手数料も安く送金も早そうで良さそうですね
とりあえず、bitbankの垢開設もそろそろのはずなので、待とうと思います〜
5798 2018-01-01 14:58:18 Trx for long term with most promising gain. It will not be a short flip though. If you have the patience/discipline to hold for 8-12 months you very well could have huge gains. Be cautious of the quick cash....its here in crypto but not at the rate it is shilled on the internet

5812 2018-01-01 14:57:24 Some of you might be wondering why I'm spending 4 figures sums on crypto currencies you didn't hear about until just the other day. It's all right I know what I'm doing.

5819 2018-01-01 14:56:27 @360_trader What would you recommend for a long term hold for a person just entering the crypto market with low funds? I am thinking maybe $trx to get more bang for your buck in the long run? Maybe $POE or $CND? Thanks for your input!

5840 2018-01-01 14:54:12 I'd much rather Ripple succeed so wildly that bankers started loaning out "not a scam" crypto tokens.

Tether is another token that is hugely exciting to me. Not because I need them or want them, but because they are PRINTING USD JUST LIKE ANY "LEGIT" BANK!!!

5868 2018-01-01 14:51:06 Totally agree. Once we will move into NIRP there will be a ban on cash (Graham Summers, The Everything Bubble), hence the transfer of cash into crypto currencies needs to be blocked as well. Just wonder why BOJ seems to be so relaxed about this topic.

5885 2018-01-01 14:49:23 LN is a crypto-banking system, I don’t think it will evolve into the decentralized network it’s claiming, channels with every shop/person you intend to trade will be too costly

5893 2018-01-01 14:48:59 It is long list and it will only get longer.The need for privacy coins is seen everywhere but its not just privacy.For example @DeepOnionx has many great features for day to day use like DeepVault (file authentication) - no more worries if you are looking at original file or not
5894 2018-01-01 14:48:52 I see restrictions on the $Crypto system everyday.

5914 2018-01-01 14:47:01 I did my research. At the end of the day; it’s up to you to take profits. I make my buys in crypto for long term plays. Period. You don’t follow me to day trade. I don’t trade. Period. Everyone who’s actually followed me knows that. You haven’t followed me. So remain salty
5915 2018-01-01 14:46:49 Eventually, as they say, “Good money will chase out the Bad”.  The shit coins will all die a slow death and  wealth will flow back to BTC.  BTC should have over 80% of total crypto market share.

5965 2018-01-01 14:41:31 Better buying crypto currency Keepo
5966 2018-01-01 14:41:29 I just published “REAL ESTATE IS SET TO BE THE NEXT CRYPTO FLYING TO THE MOON”@RPToken2017
5967 2018-01-01 14:41:28 @binance_2017  happy new year binance! I made a transaction yesterday, but I'm not seeing my tokens show up in my account. Anyone I can talk to get this figured out? 

Thanks!
5968 2018-01-01 14:41:18 Before the end of the year. But this time we won't tell you which year
5969 2018-01-01 14:41:10 Lolololoooo . . . Did he write come one?  C'mon now.  It's 21st century yo
5970 2018-01-01 14:41:08 To taka ukryta crypto reklama   żeby sobie przypomnieli jak to się robi i gdzie są korzenie
5971 2018-01-01 14:40:44 Kind of like trading money in crypto currency?
5972 2018-01-01 14:40:37 So fucking true. Crypto is nothing but a bunch of global millennials trying to make progress in their life. I'll give em a hint: try working, producing wealth rather than gambling

5977 2018-01-01 14:39:47 After getting robbed by dogewallet, prelude exch, #mintpal, moolah, cryptsy, Mtgox and finally DogetipBot . It's time to get back to #crypto with 0.5 #BTC target for this new year #dogecoin #bitcoin . i'll be taking advice from @CryptoCobain  smart ass gaydog guru in this venture
5978 2018-01-01 14:39:31 She IS a real person!
5979 2018-01-01 14:39:30 In terms of product, nothing significant yet. In terms of people's trust, crypto has won the game. Next step is the applicability. Without trust nothing would have worked just like without the social graph, FB wouldn't have a great business model. #blockchain
5980 2018-01-01 14:39:26 @crypto_sarah9 why are you still going? You guys are hyping up absolutely nothing. And we're supposed to trust somebody who's using fake profiles. Because that's not you in your picture
5981 2018-01-01 14:39:18 The only thing that is fraud is wraith protocol!
5982 2018-01-01 14:39:13 2000%
5983 2018-01-01 14:39:13 I think a better stat is @onchainfx 's 24hr Tx volume by $.  Since crypto's main use-case atm is hodling and trading you need indicators of these two metrics (hodl & trading amounts).
5984 2018-01-01 14:39:12 He's incompetent, over-privileged, not very bright, and totally obnoxious, but I'm not sure he meets the formal definition of a 'fascist'. Why don't we call him a 'crypto-fascist'fid now?
5985 2018-01-01 14:39:00 Flash
5986 2018-01-01 14:38:58 How about a follow back or a comment back @crypto_sarah9? You always riding McAfee and ignoring me. Lol

5994 2018-01-01 14:37:41 J'espère ! Hier, je suis parvenue à écrire sur Les Chats du Louvre (et pas que le tweet un peu crypto d'hier, une page entière), mais là, soit il me faudra du temps pour structurer, soit il me faut peut-être du sommeil en plus :).
5995 2018-01-01 14:37:39 @justinvendetta How does it feel to be seen as 2018's lamest guy in the whole crypto world ?? Dat Q4 2017 release though ! LMAO Work on your PR next time, that fiasco is all yours ...
5996 2018-01-01 14:37:32 Verge holders I swear are brainwashed. All to the moon comments without researching.  Was looking for a great privacy coin to invest. Finally choosing Enigma.

6000 2018-01-01 14:37:09 I'm skeptical too, but whenever I dropped a coin / token, in 2-3 days it exploded. This time. or win, or lose everything. Is so simple, this time.
6001 2018-01-01 14:37:07 Sir, what about $MCO ? No moves til now...thx.
6002 2018-01-01 14:36:56 There is no deadline... well maybe by 2019 or never. Sell it fast. its a scam
6003 2018-01-01 14:36:52 Yay to all the free airdrops this crypto addicting world is giving us 
6004 2018-01-01 14:36:45 Do your own research and then you’ll have nobody to blame but yourself. Investing because of a twitter account would be moronic.

6006 2018-01-01 14:36:33 noticed a little pump on power ledger upon this tweet coming out.. coincidence? or is he trying to trick the bots...?
6007 2018-01-01 14:36:24 年金は生涯年収の中に含まれているので、生涯年収が目安かなぁと思います。

ポイントはインフレですよね〜。

インフレへの対処ができて、複利で運用出来れば、１億も有れば十分かなぁという気がします。
でも、結局インフレに強いのは仮想通貨なのでやめらないというジレンマ…

#しらんけど
6008 2018-01-01 14:36:24 The wraith price was already worked into the 1700+ SATs we seen yesterday. The market isn't stupid. When they failed to deliver, it sank. I sold all mine last night at peak before release. Buy the rumor sell the news. Because an event is always less climatic than the anticipation
6009 2018-01-01 14:36:10 Yes they can. You need to pull the wool over your eyes. If you don't put your buy order in with 3 seconds of his tweet you're too late and you get rekt

6035 2018-01-01 14:33:34 Also interesting to keep in mind, if banks can print USD now, what gives those ones value? And if it can work for USD in the short term, why couldn't it work for banks printing crypto assets?
6036 2018-01-01 14:33:22 Using a fake account to pump xvg. Devs have now promised and failed to deliver on at least 3 occasions. This is not a billion dollar coin. Crypto Sarah, or whoever manages this account should be ashamed

6055 2018-01-01 14:31:21 Not even working properly... no date release for other platforms. No communication from the team. They have nothing to say. It's a scam. They paid mcaffee to pump the coin but not enough so he retracted his initial tweets.
6056 2018-01-01 14:31:19 Not only am I hodling, I upped my position in anticipation. Now I'm trapped after their collapse and fawking up. Hoping it comes soon. At this point I just want to get half my position back without a loss until they can prove to be what they say they are.
6057 2018-01-01 14:31:07 Is it really going to take off though?

6064 2018-01-01 14:30:21 The Domains: A fair number of domain investors had their attention off in other areas in 2017. The stock market did well and many were totally enamored with cryptocurrencies. Are you as interested in domaining as years past, or are you diversifying into crypto and spending more…

6077 2018-01-01 14:29:26 That can’t be done with crypto because there’s only s finite amount of coins ever available.   Making more stock available after a certain amount was originally promised is called “dilution”. Also can be done with crypto but generally isn’t. Esp. Bitcoin litecoin. Just FYI.

6079 2018-01-01 14:29:16 2017 created a number of new “crypto-experts”. Everyone’s a “genius” in an uptrend. But how many of these “experts” were buying — or even knew about cryptos — five years ago? We have been #hodling before it was cool. Use wisdom. Long track records matter in 2018.

6081 2018-01-01 14:28:52 Congrats on your SPR call. Really impressive
6082 2018-01-01 14:28:46 Another thing that's going to get hurt by crypto is lending....You can now pool your funds trustlessly, and while that side hasnt really got going yet its just a matter of time IMO till people are doing most of their investing and borrowing without any institutional involvement

6090 2018-01-01 14:28:24 It's a scam. They send signals to all members at specific time for selected coin, but you will never win because they have bots. You always loose.
6091 2018-01-01 14:28:23 @Altcoinbuzzio I just sold everything. Crypto ate my life. I started with 3500€ a month ago and am at 4000€ now, with about 5000 € lost to stupid decisions. I just don't know if I should just give up on crypto or basically "reset"...
6092 2018-01-01 14:27:58 年末が楽しみ
6093 2018-01-01 14:27:58 200 btc to stop trading daily and spending 16+ hours daily working in crypto. But, I'll never exit this market.

6101 2018-01-01 14:27:10 Do it. I've done a couple fix & flips, looking for my next one. As a crypto newbie, I'm discovering similar requirements for success: research, persistence and plain old action. Good luck this year. BTW, thanks for your crypto insights.
6102 2018-01-01 14:27:05 Ah chiedilo a tua sorella se c’è l’ho piccolo.
6103 2018-01-01 14:27:04 I think nobody cares, people want to make money.. as soon as the full release is out with all the bugs people will switch to other privacy coins.. which are actually working. They can't deliver on time how can they program a privacy coin? Very sad I'm really disappointed..
6104 2018-01-01 14:26:51 んんん〜？？？

6127 2018-01-01 14:25:27 I shouldn't have invested because he gave a false name to the police in 2005? I got a speeding ticket in 2014, am I also a bad person?

6129 2018-01-01 14:25:17 "separate the crypto currencies from the infrastructure" - We left you two posts, it's what we just wrote

In regards to Building on #eth
-Potentially
-Or many #coins are building there own platforms
-Some on newer Eth style coins with upgraded/newer tech

6149 2018-01-01 14:23:21 I don't know about that. I'm still fightim the urge to dump and hodling on tightly. However, their lack of communication and follow through is scaring people away. Nothing worse then try to convince someone to try a new dish with a bad taste in their mouth.
6150 2018-01-01 14:23:21 If it goes below 20%; it most likely means Altcoins are making orgasmic, exponential lunges upwards. So, it means the stage is set for Altcoins to play their "Popcorn Symphonies"!! It'll be a sight to behold!!

6160 2018-01-01 14:22:09 That's both not surprising and deeply concerning. I guess we will see what the future holds. I didn't lose out, but ' questionable ' is the highest amount of positivity I can muster right now.
6161 2018-01-01 14:22:04 I can now start 2018 on an optimistic note - there is a crypto girl out there for me somewhere...

6189 2018-01-01 14:19:06 Venezuela has unbelievable resources. They have been trying to become financially independent from the central banks so they have been getting bad international deals. Crypto could help them do this.

6194 2018-01-01 14:18:11 All the coins are owned by 5% so 90% coins owned by 5% and they all sell and buy together and take everybody moneyZ classic pump and dump coin. Just look at the buy and sells
6195 2018-01-01 14:18:09 Crypto currency
6196 2018-01-01 14:18:08 Market cap with crypto currency is different than stocks. It doesn't tie directly into a companies evaluation. This is a whole new space, buddy.

6198 2018-01-01 14:18:06 There are no #trends, #experts, etc in #crypto. It's too damn new of a #market & most #coins don't even have a real #world purpose yet. So these self proclaimed experts are full of shit. They just spread #opinions to pump & dump. Do your own research. #NOFOMO.
6199 2018-01-01 14:18:01 And stealth mode wont be ready for at least another week....that was the final straw for me
6200 2018-01-01 14:17:57 What's for? Crypto has too much fan to go to retire.

6202 2018-01-01 14:17:47 #Lendroid that is a great project and   nice, it's give opportunity. Crypto is a bet against the modern macroeconomic dogma, it is interst to increase.
6203 2018-01-01 14:17:44 Hecho. Gracias, Pablo. Me pierdo las crypto pero lo importante es competir (?)
6204 2018-01-01 14:17:37 Dude, your defending Cardano. THE most overvalued project in crypto space, right up there with ripple and XVG. Something worst I can think of is a project where the CEO ran off with the ICO funds to retire in Uruguay.
6205 2018-01-01 14:17:30 500k enough, starting a project, continue investing in crypto
6206 2018-01-01 14:17:24 Watching what happens when you over promise and under deliver. Unfortunately, I believed the hype, and not sure how long this decline cycle will take to move positive. But,  HODL for a while longer.
6207 2018-01-01 14:17:20 Yo! Can u look at @neurocoinnews ???? kinda promising!
6208 2018-01-01 14:17:15 Have you ever seen any kind of talk?  People coming up to spout their own ideas without asking questions is obnoxious and tends to take forever.  If you’re not one of the speakers, ask a question and then shut up.
6209 2018-01-01 14:17:02 good luck!
6210 2018-01-01 14:16:56 You mean update that has been 3x postponed already and always pumped the price? $xvg s ridiculously overpriced and overhyped out of mcafees tweets and everyone fomoing thinking it will easily reach 1$, cause they do not understand how market caps work. Please stay with low cap 
6211 2018-01-01 14:16:44 I wanted to become a drug counselor but I can't afford my bills on that kind of salary. Hoping Crypto can change that & I can live both dreams. Crypto trading &a part time drug counselor.
6212 2018-01-01 14:16:42 Happiness is not the purpose of life; it is the bi-product of a live well lived. I guess this is why central bankers and politicians are such miserable people.

tells how far the mania has gotten into the mainstream
6249 2018-01-01 14:13:33 Their reasons don't matter.  If they default, it'll prove that centrally controlled crypto doesn't help irresponsible people be responsible. Response?  a) decentralized crypto that takes away ability to be irresponsible, or b) crypto can't help irresponsible govs.

6282 2018-01-01 14:11:33 despite me being unable to purchase any crypto whatsoever due to me being underage, i still keep my eye on the scene because of my interwst towards it. watching each random coin that paid mcaffee a metric fuck ton just to sponsor their coin made many others rich in turn.

6286 2018-01-01 14:11:16 Geez. In South Africa I'm looking at R5m ($333 333) to jump into crypto full time.
6287 2018-01-01 14:11:05 @decredproject , autonomous on-chain governance, the most decentralized and undervalued crypto in this moment, and they will implement fully privacy in 1Q° of 2018
6288 2018-01-01 14:11:03 I’m with @g3nology - $2M. Enough to buy a comfortable house and still continue in crypto. 
6289 2018-01-01 14:10:56 A lot of people talk down $trx because of market cap.

A: Q1 "coin burn" will bring it down to $xrp levels (which is at $2)

B: The overall crypto cap will increase in 2018, as it did in 2017.  This is still a niche market.

C: It has the roadmap/leadership to be a top 5 coin.
6290 2018-01-01 14:10:54 Hah the rest of the crypto are basically bitcoin disguised as some wonder coin with no real world use and are way overvalued compared to iota. Also Ripple is the exact opposite of what Bitcoin stood when it was first introduced.

6301 2018-01-01 14:10:09 Depends on your location & lifestyle I‘d say
6302 2018-01-01 14:10:03 its crazy that media and 'propaganda' is the 'real' influence behind economics especially in crypto. although im not experienced in any regard in crypto nor economics but its so clear to see how much of an influence big figureheads can have on whether something fails or succeeds.

6348 2018-01-01 14:04:59 BTC commodities is the power of believing but fuel is a lot of grey/dark money that injected inside. Truth  is that someone can use human nature weakness to false all decentralized society idea using force of BIG money. That is why price gaining in crypto is dangerous 4 use.

6356 2018-01-01 14:04:14 The arrogance before the #WraithProtocol release and the dead silence after they failed miserably is the main reason why i wont put any $$ back into $xvg while its tanking, even if it rebounds...not the type of people I like to do business with. Not with so many choices

6370 2018-01-01 14:02:28 A somewhat nonsensical answer IMO. I think you need to separate the crypto currencies from the infrastructure (blockchain). But yes I (and you) can build an Ethereum consortium on the cloud very quick, so obviously some of the banks settlement/intermediation margins will hurt.

6374 2018-01-01 14:02:12 Looks like another sell off day in crypto. Time to be patient and look for the right play.
6375 2018-01-01 14:01:52 Most people buy crypto to get rich. #Bitcoin was outperformed by alts % wise until forks and futures gave people a reason to sell alts and buy #BTC again. Now that the futures are forks are mostly here, alts are crushing in % again. Unless real attack occur,, $BTC disadvantaged.
6376 2018-01-01 14:01:49 If you haven’t mentioned @FatihSK87 this list is incomplete,he will give you unbiased charts,go through his older posts and he has predicted events when they seem impossible to happen. He is Zen of the crypto world. He is the one who trades emotion.
6377 2018-01-01 14:01:48 アルトが右肩上がりの中、ビットコは下がる一方でイライラしてるんじゃないですか？彼らｗ

A narrow definition of a good crypto investment that excludes DLT as a solid tech development for FIs is short sighted at best. Might want to squint a bit and reconsider this one.
6391 2018-01-01 14:00:14 しかし、それ関係の景気の良い話はマスコミからは聞かれず、アベノミクスは失敗だ景気は悪くなっているの大合唱ですなぁ。ぶっちゃけ儲かってんの？
6392 2018-01-01 14:00:09 #Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko made a splash in the #crypto world by making Belarus - the first country to legalize #blockchain! Belarus became the first blockchain #adoption point. The first time this technology being approved is a global trigger for the innovations!￼
6393 2018-01-01 14:00:05 Agrrmeed on highly overspeculated, but which crypto is not?

Full node owners of IOTA and Bitcoin both get zero direct financial rewards.

If IOTA is the HD-DVD of IoT, then who is Bluray?

6400 2018-01-01 13:59:28 Just recieved info to sell #xvg before it crushes! What is happening out there?
6401 2018-01-01 13:59:25 That could be right and could even extend the list. But if you want to see this to set an example of how governments will issue crypto, you’re taking the wrong path. Specially if you’re talking about trust. There’s no trust with mafia

6403 2018-01-01 13:58:57 Please explain why your account is fake.  I Been taking your advice and your account Is fake.. What else are you lying about huh #vxg #Vergecurrency @crypto_sarah9

6405 2018-01-01 13:58:44 Beginning today (thanks to the new GOP tax law), everytime you sell a cryptocurrency (even for another crypto) it will be a taxable event. Don’t trade in and out mindlessly but #hodl for the best gains in 2018!
6406 2018-01-01 13:58:40 Well you are not the only one who thought soo...
6407 2018-01-01 13:58:36 Yep which is exactly why I support it. Just wish I could have staked more before XP blew up 
6408 2018-01-01 13:58:31 The crypto market is heated and hyped beyond reason. But there are some coins that have a great technology and idea behind it. It's worth looking into these.
6409 2018-01-01 13:58:30 I have the same problem and i dm ed already as well could you help me
6410 2018-01-01 13:58:23 こんなところ　#yukarin
6411 2018-01-01 13:58:11 Look at me, I'm a stupid bitch who has to #####EVERYTHING. Oh fyi? 300k isn't rich, and that's what you have. I'm sure it was a man who introduced you to crypto, you're clearly far too stupid to come across it on your own.
6412 2018-01-01 13:58:10 ケンちゃんの他にも仮想通貨高校生は何人か見かけたねｗ
6413 2018-01-01 13:57:43 you need to shill #xvg some more

6416 2018-01-01 13:57:36 I thought you stopped doing coin of the day?
6417 2018-01-01 13:57:11 Same. Maybe they will be called "crypto kiddies"
6418 2018-01-01 13:57:10 Lmao it's amusing that you think because someone doesn't have twitter followers they have no money. Maybe for your generation of inaugerated malcontents. It doubled your networth? so you went from 20k GBP to 40, yeah, well done.
6419 2018-01-01 13:57:09 clown, any crypto that wants to survive will need to play by the rules to be adopted, accepted and used global.  The rest will be subjected to regulation that renders them worthless. The government won't just roll over ad be cut out #clueless

6422 2018-01-01 13:57:01 Yeah this crypto currency stuff not for me lol
6423 2018-01-01 13:57:00 I’ve always found the obsession with gold by sections of the old world odd... gold has very limited true value outside some applications in electronics. It’s entire value is just as imaginary and ephemeral as paper money or crypto.
6424 2018-01-01 13:56:53 what does that mean? haha

6437 2018-01-01 13:55:09 A common phrase in crypto is #HODL 

With $trx we should come up with a new one: "Buy More Of That Shit"

6440 2018-01-01 13:54:45 Xvg at .13 - what happened ?
6441 2018-01-01 13:54:28 Someone DM'ed to say my prediction for $BTC in my last tweet was bullshit because drug dealers use it.

If you think #BTC is going to be zero next January, I'll happily buy your BTC for a good price

6443 2018-01-01 13:54:15 誰かを幸せにしようとすると皮肉なことに必ずその人と戦う時がくるんだよね。
人によって幸せって違うから、方向性が合わずに揉める時が必ずくる。
むしろ、自分の幸せを壊す悪者扱いされる。
それでも後悔しない相手を見つけられたならそれこそが幸せなのかもしれない。

6444 2018-01-01 13:54:14 Don't get caught up in daily price swings of #bitcoin, look at the body of work bitcoin has accomplished over the past 9 yrs..against all odds, bitcoin is winning on the front lines of the #currency war:

decentral open-source digital equity money VS. central physical debt money

6457 2018-01-01 13:52:43  ~2.4 or it softens. See what the morrow dawns. Crypto Exchange Blockchain opportunity at good value IMO $FGF showing all the right behaviour technically leading up. Hopefully placement is sound. This could go north very quickly following $RFN $OOK $DCC etc on a good deal.
6458 2018-01-01 13:52:05 I've done the same.

6479 2018-01-01 13:49:11 You forgot your favorite crypto!
6480 2018-01-01 13:48:35 Credit rating and scoring is as meaningless as crypto currency. I'm so interested in seeing how bad this concept is gonna crash and burn. The value is placed on concept. It's only as valuable as you think it is
6481 2018-01-01 13:48:32 Happens to the best of us, Loom!!! 
I agree that 2018 will see a ton of bank analysts researching crypto justifying every price movement with legacy mumbo jumbo...

6548 2018-01-01 13:40:39 I’m sure BTC will have its bounce, but as a holdr it seems like other crypto have superb tech and functionality. So are you:

6550 2018-01-01 13:40:20 In crypto, in life, in all things, I heed you to remember this;

In order for an arrow to go forward it must first be pulled back. 

If you're in a dip, stay there and ride it out and up, after buying more.....
6551 2018-01-01 13:40:18 But for that you could still potentially go to a branch of the bank - until there’s a way to bring crypto currency to a bank and exchange it for cash you’ll kinda be stuck I feel like
6552 2018-01-01 13:40:17 Say what you want about crypto. Crypto is still capital formation that wouldn't otherwise exist if it wasn't for crypto. It's money that would have just been spent on more marijuana cigarettes & pizza. It's mainly single male differed consumption.
6553 2018-01-01 13:40:13 え！？みてないんですか？そういうところまで
調べてないんですか？
こういう細かいところまで見る重要性は

6555 2018-01-01 13:39:51 It looks like it the last chance to drop #xvg its going DOWN! #verge #vergecurrency #WRAITHPROTOCOL is a scam!

6560 2018-01-01 13:39:30 Thankfully there are cycles to most things, but, the unknown is the time of each rise and fall.
6561 2018-01-01 13:39:27 Look: i really don't care. It's my money, my investment. I don't get why people are getting angry and emotional about someone elses choice. Just do what you want man. Don't like it? Then sell! No need to attack people for their faith in a coin. It's not about picking sides here.

6578 2018-01-01 13:36:59 They made a announcement of an announcement that sounded too good, filled their wallets with emc and sold it all right before the "mindblowing announcement". As well the announcement came 15 minutes too late because they had to sell off at that moment. This is a No-Go

6603 2018-01-01 13:34:54 What's your point? people have gotten rich off of doge too. The fact that you want to prove you're rich will make people realize what a fucking idiot you are.
6604 2018-01-01 13:34:51 yeah alright but why do you have a fake profile with pics from a canadian girl tho?
6605 2018-01-01 13:34:50 If you don believe me BCH is scam, then please look again who is behind this and what are their motives. But I suppose you are still young and newbie to crypto world.. Next year you will see I was right.

6614 2018-01-01 13:34:18 In general, to raise a market cap of already top 10 coin takes some huge resources. I doubt the whole crypto verse just started investing in it. It all looks very fishy. In addition, I really encourage to read @multicoincap analysis on $XRP on their website. CC @KyleSamani
6615 2018-01-01 13:34:18 I'm a developer so yes I've used a PC. I'm just saying it's not good practice to ask people to enter commands without explaining what they do. Not everyone is comfortable using a terminal. I'm not trying to argue, I was just making a point that there are some worrying signals.

6622 2018-01-01 13:33:25 Some of the ideological debates on crypto-currencies remind me of the oft heated Open Source vs closed (read Microsoft) of the 2000s. Incidentally Microsoft is now a top contributor on Github.

6634 2018-01-01 13:31:55 Funny how verge cult and ripple cult are the ones so insistent on overthrowing bitcoin, also funny 99% of them started crypto last week
6635 2018-01-01 13:31:48 Indeed a good idea, I might look into that but I need a platform through which my clients can pay via Cards and stuff and I can't think Crypto would be an easy way for them to deal with me.

6640 2018-01-01 13:30:45 30k is not a lot of money. I believe Verge will get popular because of money laundering not because of you tweeting "to the moon" every 30 min.
6641 2018-01-01 13:30:15 I can say 2017 was a crypto-year @SatoshiLite @BrianDEvans @coindesk

6647 2018-01-01 13:29:35 I like this coin a lot, but they need more marketing and more exchanges. Imagine what cloak's price would be if it had XVG's hype?
6648 2018-01-01 13:29:23 You can cross one more off your list! I've spent my hard earned money to stack up over 50k in XVG! Nobody paid me to promote or speak positive of any of the coins I am Hodling
6649 2018-01-01 13:29:16 1500 SAFEX fee to withdraw from Cryptopia is insane! Have you talked to them about this?

6658 2018-01-01 13:28:43 They missed a deadline. I get that people are frustrated. The tech is released tho. It's real. People who are selling are just the peeps who expected a 5000% profit in a couple of hours. Healthier for the coin to get rid of them.
6659 2018-01-01 13:28:30 Got into #XP last night in a dip for a pretty good price. 51k worth. I like the project and #Gaming and #socialmedia are big, so why not for a few dollars?

6663 2018-01-01 13:27:31 Open question in #crypto : 
Is the need for Decentralisation and Censorship Resistance changing? 
I mean: is a single company today as a SPoF for a currency, maybe less or more likely to be "shut down" by govs, then let's say 3-4 years ago?
6664 2018-01-01 13:27:25 You know how it's works. Nice girl you go.
6665 2018-01-01 13:27:17 Unlike BTC & ETH #Ripple is an actual company that wants to revolutionise banking. XRP is their crypto currency. This Co is growing in keeps and bounds recently. @BlackBerry need to move in and secure their intellectual property.

6667 2018-01-01 13:27:06 @officialmcafee Coin of the day should be $ZCL, with the upcoming fork to $BTCP this could be a lot bigger than $BTG / $BCC in the future.

6671 2018-01-01 13:26:40 ありがとうございます。確認できました。確かにその通りですね～～
6672 2018-01-01 13:26:36 There is a learning curve to crypto, but no matter the size of your bags it's always best to control your own keys unless you need to put on exchange for active trading. Not good idea to keep funds there. For future, the #Ardor and $NXT wallets have the easiest to use installers.

6701 2018-01-01 13:23:18 $XVG has something the world of crypto needs & waited for. No matter how the price reacts right now, keep #HODL they can’t ignore ones they need it.
6702 2018-01-01 13:22:55 2017 has been an unbelievable year, shit changed from 0 to 100 real quick, just checked my portfolio results did freaking 43,000% in 7 months.

6779 2018-01-01 13:14:22 Yeah, then you've got people like XVGwhale, who I'm sure were just as responsible for the last shill as Mcafee himself.
6780 2018-01-01 13:14:14 VERGEスレの阿鼻叫喚がおもろすぎる
6781 2018-01-01 13:14:12 Es necesario poner en perspectiva el coste en energía total del sistema financiero contra el del Bitcoin. 

No solo tecnológico, sino de aquellos agentes que intervienen que el BTC y las crypto eliminarían. 

Estos artículos son superficiales, y sesgados.
6782 2018-01-01 13:13:54 拝読しました^^

「年度末に円に換えなかった人でも」のところだけ、「年末」が正しいと思いました(*^^*)
6783 2018-01-01 13:13:47 This is the problem with the fanboys, I want to like the coin, but I can't. It's built upon inconsistency. I'm sure 90% of the holders don't even know about the pump and dump Mcafee fiasco. I honestly don't think anyone gives two shits about wraith.
6784 2018-01-01 13:13:46 Du coup, wait and see ?
6785 2018-01-01 13:13:45 Well done @davidgokhshtein!  You are indeed a man of the people - and you are to be admired!!
6786 2018-01-01 13:13:44 Holding and waiting. Looking forward to increasing the valuation of XVG time tells all.
6787 2018-01-01 13:13:39 お役に立てたなら本望です☆やったぜ
6788 2018-01-01 13:13:35 It’s concerning how much you feel need to constantly push this every 2 mins. Im behind XVG 100% but it feels very much so like marketing to me.
6789 2018-01-01 13:13:34 The dev said it would take another week to fix.... im out regadless. Even if it drops fully working i cant throw my $$ behind such unprofessionals, who cant even update thier investors timely
6790 2018-01-01 13:13:33 Moon is a bit further than on the Earth lol
6791 2018-01-01 13:13:22 Ojala fuera así, pero estas navidades en las cenas de muchas casas se ha hablado e interesado en ICO, crypto etc gente que no sabe ni lo que es una cuenta corriente o un fondo...y ahí viene el lío... Siempre es así
6792 2018-01-01 13:13:13 De même dans l’ouest de la France. Mais cela permet de s’informer, d’arbitrer le cas échéant...
6793 2018-01-01 13:13:10 I mean Coinbase need Ripple, Coinbase will be in trouble if they ignored the 2nd largest mkt cap crypto
6794 2018-01-01 13:12:31 Awesome!  I feel intimidated though - lol.   For those asking him to share.....he gave you the most important category headings - sheesh.
6795 2018-01-01 13:12:03 It hit its peak with McAfee shilling it’ll probably get there this year but considering the mess that is wraith launch, don’t expect it this month.

6809 2018-01-01 13:09:49 You are a crypto Diva......
6810 2018-01-01 13:09:45 coinmarketcap exists to see the crypto not to determinize a leader in the crypto space...
6811 2018-01-01 13:09:38 A hardware wallet in a bank's safety deposit box. Crypto-ronic. #cryptocurrency
6812 2018-01-01 13:09:36 You need a crypto broker.
6813 2018-01-01 13:09:29 You might see 20 I see sub 1000 sats by morning then I might chuck some in to see what happens. #trxlife
6814 2018-01-01 13:09:17 $XVG it’s look like a high risk crypto but I think that anyway  $VERGE team are looking for solution and and on long term this is good investments. What do you think?
6815 2018-01-01 13:09:11 How do you know for sure
6816 2018-01-01 13:09:01 honestly i don't think there is necessarily a need of a leader, the leader of cryptocurrency space are cryptocurrencies themselves and the strength is simply the total market cap in the world market, every crypto can be a leader in their own space...
6817 2018-01-01 13:08:49 Congratulations! Have you taken profits into FIAT? I keep worrying that somehow everything goes back into Crypto  ;-)
6818 2018-01-01 13:08:46 pretty much true for me.  im rather new to crypto but not to trading.  and i love the idea of this tech.  disappointed in what's going on right now though.

6823 2018-01-01 13:08:22 Trust me I won't. I did my own research and made my own decision, and looking at the Github repo does not inspire me with confidence. Reverting commits hours before a deadline (that was not met) is not a good sign. Nor is asking people to blindly enter commands into a terminal.
6824 2018-01-01 13:08:21 I am with you...Verge Dev had a great job..No one can do this 100% anonymous. will get better~!!

そうですよね、PacCoin一点張りなんて異常ですよね
初心者すぎるやり方でお恥ずかしい限りです

最近はPacCoinに愛着が湧いてきちゃって、
離れられなくなっちゃいました
6836 2018-01-01 13:06:56 @CryptosQueen says that she knows of THREE BIG announcements for 2018, hmmmmmm......
6837 2018-01-01 13:06:44 better be some good new exchange. and able to withdraw my btc on same day so i can leave this ponzi once and for all.  never seen such incompetent devs in my crypto years.

6839 2018-01-01 13:06:37 i´m with you
6840 2018-01-01 13:06:33 @Haejin_Crypto PLEASE DO AN UPDATE ON XVG!! IS IT STILL ON TRACK FOR YOUR PREVIOUS TARGET??
6841 2018-01-01 13:06:29 They currently have a block on all crypto deposits , possibly broke up for the new year break to prevent a further back log
6842 2018-01-01 13:06:16 exactly.
6843 2018-01-01 13:06:11 With the Mac release, the price is tanking. So i really do not see why it would skyrocket with the windows release. It will go to 0.20$ and then go back down. Like i said, if they had released it on time, the price would be 0.40$ at least. Now it's indifferent. Lost momentum.
6844 2018-01-01 13:06:10 2018 is here. Time to get it in Wholesale, Crypto Mining, Financial knowledge, & of course health, family, friends, love.

6846 2018-01-01 13:06:00 There's literally no reason we should be dropping in price so hard, I think wraith was just overhyped trash that has 0 impact on the price of the coin.
6847 2018-01-01 13:05:58 I love your dedication sista
6848 2018-01-01 13:05:54 Happy New Year people!!! 2018 will be a great year!!! Especially for the crypto folks. The unexpected will happen in our favour IJN. Amen to that and have a blessed year 
6849 2018-01-01 13:05:48 Dev said it wont be complete for another week
6850 2018-01-01 13:05:42 Crypto to the  #2018 
6851 2018-01-01 13:05:40 There are several other sports betting operations that operate in the crypto space but we differ in one significant respect – #BETR take no percentage of wagers and no margin. #BetterBetting
6852 2018-01-01 13:05:31 Bonne année à toi ! Rdv en Lambo en fin d’année 
6853 2018-01-01 13:05:19 Would be happy with 1$ ;)
6854 2018-01-01 13:05:14 Yeah it is, but taxation is theft so I have to find a place where they don't tax crypto..but also don't tax me stupid high.
6855 2018-01-01 13:05:05 Unlike you, I don't need to show the world what my portfolio is worth just to make other deluded fools blindly pump their money into this shitcoin
6856 2018-01-01 13:04:54 evet,  ben de iki gundur onu bekliyorum.

6859 2018-01-01 13:04:27 Where’s the laughing emoji
6860 2018-01-01 13:04:26 That’s the thing. These are all just predictions. No one can ever know 100% what will happen unfortunately. Unless there are big announcements or things in the pipeline it’s hard to estimate prices.

You still pretending to be the girl in your profile pic?
6865 2018-01-01 13:04:02 ofcourse you should add eth. eth is becoming the standard for smart contracts in the crypto ecosystem. eth has more transactions per day the bitcoin and also more active addresses used per day too.
6866 2018-01-01 13:04:02 They fucked the momentum...

6869 2018-01-01 13:03:52 2017 will go down as a transformative year.
Populism becomes stronger and corrupt establishment weaker. There is legitimate fear among the elite. They are trying to ignore this crypto/blockchain shift, their days are clearly counted.

6878 2018-01-01 13:02:33 Haha. Yes I know
6879 2018-01-01 13:02:16 I'm novice. But it's no wonder why their hasnt been mass adoption of Crypto. Look at how all these ass clown troll fcks fudded $xvg for the last two weeks. Grown ass men with no shame.  Pathetic. All these "shitcoin" "experts " with all that money and they still hate.

6882 2018-01-01 13:02:10 @BittrexExchange when is the ARDR market coming back online? The snapshot was days ago and the platform was released 12 hours ago...
6883 2018-01-01 13:02:03 “crypto”is about the only space where investors do not have to worry about big tech (Amazon, Facebook, Google...). plenty else to worry about of course.
6884 2018-01-01 13:01:49 I'm a fan of Ozil hence I use his pic, I'm not pretending to be someone I'm not, unlike you.

When you make 100k? Yeah okay, you carry on dreaming and making your garbage xvg promo vids while the price carries on tanking 
6885 2018-01-01 13:01:29 #Ripple is kind of balance between unregulated crypto market and overly regulated traditional financial system.
In the real world we still need some rules to keep the ball rolling. Unless you really need to hide your dirty money. Soon or later they will find a way to trace it.
6886 2018-01-01 13:01:14 Current price of #Bitcoin is $13234.45 $btc
6887 2018-01-01 13:01:09 toutes les crypto-monnais ont une valeur bien réelle et donc effectivement tu peux echanger tes cryptos comme le bitcoin ou le Raiblocks contre des devises classic comme l'euro
6888 2018-01-01 13:00:56 Interesting how the countries with the largest and most disposable income economies have gravitated to crypto.  Japan and USA.

6894 2018-01-01 13:00:05 I think it's time to stop encouraging people to buy. The rocket has crashed and burned. The dev has not met deadlines and is claiming unfinished and flawed software to be a "release". #XVG is finished. Get out while you can.

6900 2018-01-01 12:59:25 Okay so you're gonna do crypto?
6901 2018-01-01 12:59:25 Congrats for losing the money when it crashes?
6902 2018-01-01 12:59:24 Seems like the big twitter crypto accounts slowly go from actual crypto calls and advice to random rants and shilling other accounts.
6903 2018-01-01 12:59:20 You have to be prepared to wait at least 6 months I’d say. Crypto is still finding its fit in the modern society
6904 2018-01-01 12:59:13 bonne année Khey!
6905 2018-01-01 12:58:28 People don’t care about the Dev team or the actual product their investing in. They just want instant gains and profits. It’s sad really. If they really want to gain $ from this they need to shut up and support the team building these great things
6906 2018-01-01 12:58:26 wait list is closed for now. Makes no sense to put you on a list of 250+
6907 2018-01-01 12:58:25 definitely google profitability calculators..obviously don't wanna invest in mining machines that aren't profitable right now. I've been mining BTC and it can be very profitable...depending on your equipment.
6908 2018-01-01 12:58:23 I'm waiting 24
6909 2018-01-01 12:58:17 Lol no worries. I’m not a financial expert either just a stock options and now crypto trader.  Market expansion could probably be stated as increased market capitalization so that’s fair. Inflation however has little to do with crypto currency as it’s not a currency and cannot

6915 2018-01-01 12:57:35 So many crypto newbies will lose faith in cryptocurrencys because of such a scam.
6916 2018-01-01 12:57:33 生き残る術は、１０個くらいに分散しとけば大体解決するよね。

分散はコインの種類、トークン発行体の業種、取引所、購買層の国、流行った時期、色々考えないと本当に分散はしてくんないけど。全部Fiatに吸われるし。
6917 2018-01-01 12:57:27 Crypto will take over this year! Just remember why we're in it. The tech will change the world and we can make some life changing money along the way!

6942 2018-01-01 12:54:42 First off, "are you so idiot" where in the blue hell did you learn English?? If you wish to be an advocate for a group... at least learn proper grammar! For using that word pretty often, it seems you reflect it upon yourself even more!
6943 2018-01-01 12:54:36 Sure. Everyone has different goals. I am just not really sure that the majority of short-terms traders realize that short-term trading is what prolongs the wait for long-terms profits. That's the source of all FUD.

This is the early adoption phase
6952 2018-01-01 12:53:38 So...would you explain me please you crypto guru?

6957 2018-01-01 12:52:33 Most #crypto buyers should be willing to hodl for atleast a year. Too impatient people looking to get some lottery win, c'mon.

Hodl $XVG for a year now and you'll likely get very wealthy. People who want instant gratification will be burned and will hate themselfs EOY 2018 lol.
6958 2018-01-01 12:52:19 Invest? Only issue is the the good wallets don’t allow traders in LK to sell crypto

6980 2018-01-01 12:50:11 それですねーw
新年早々バトルするとは思わなかったw
6981 2018-01-01 12:49:53 How could Satoshi not come back after that. Oh where for art thou!
6982 2018-01-01 12:49:49 Also, people are in complete disbelief. Selling. Why? Bc XVG didn't keep their word on a time frame THEY chose. Like i said, if it was released on time, price would be 0.40$ today. But now it's pretty indifferent to ppl. You can, mac release, price tanking ;)
6983 2018-01-01 12:49:45 8000人見てるしもうこれライブだわ

6986 2018-01-01 12:49:20 Do you know something that i dont.... is it ready in 24h ?
6987 2018-01-01 12:49:17 Im in on fun but not the others. Just wish I had some more cash to play around with. It's been a tough year 
6988 2018-01-01 12:49:01 Ggwp.
6989 2018-01-01 12:48:50 The reason I originally bought into crypto was I was bored and I figured if I can make some money doing it, that’s cool. $xvg is exactly what I was looking for - it’s entertaining to watch and funny af to read all the comments/trolls/hype gods.. etc. I have no reason to leave.
6990 2018-01-01 12:48:27 Thanks for the advice, but i am not looking for 15 min profits :)
6991 2018-01-01 12:48:20 @6BillionPeople happy new year crypto expert
6992 2018-01-01 12:48:16 $dgb
6993 2018-01-01 12:47:50 You are not a clown but a puppet and a parrot writing what they tell you to write. You are in profits because you bought XVG dirt cheap. But there are ppl that bought at 0.18$, hoping to get profits, and now are underwater. Look at yourself in the mirror and think if u r correct.
6994 2018-01-01 12:47:49 Me!

7001 2018-01-01 12:46:59 Invested a very small amount in four new coins yesterday! Which do you think will be most profitable in 2018? I'm thinking Cardano... #bitcoin #litecoin #ethereum #cardano #IOTA #EOS #TRON #ADA

7013 2018-01-01 12:45:54 The Moon? HODL is/was the most accurate statement regarding the buy in. Unless there's a reason for verge to rise by the community adopting XVG in the immediate future this looks like a hangover until recovery. Happy 2k18 y'all.
7014 2018-01-01 12:45:46 What coin will McAfee pick today? Place your bets.
I’m going with $ZCL, $AMP, $LBC
7015 2018-01-01 12:45:40 Well done sarah and well said 
7016 2018-01-01 12:45:16 You really are a moron most are worried about crypto facist Corbyn with his limitless nothingness. Admit he is biased towards foreign powers  thick on economics and a racist then let's chat
7017 2018-01-01 12:45:06 WHO CARES? IT LAUNCHED FOR MAC AND THE PRICE IS TANKING AT 0.16$ LOL IF WINDOWS IS LAUNCHED, IT WILL GO TO 0.19$ AND TANK AGAIN. IF YOU HAD RELEASED IT AT MIDNIGHT, IT WOULDVE GONE TO 0.40$. THAT'S REALITY. EAT IT. DIGEST IT.
7018 2018-01-01 12:44:59 USA is not foolish Da trump, 33 billion was given in the form of Crypto currency  not US dollars
7019 2018-01-01 12:44:56 @vergecurrency was over $2bn before the #WraithProtocol hype on NYE and is still over $2bn. All you small time investors waiting for a tweet on the release of wraith and expecting it to go to the moon are stupid. The big investors will come very soon. #XVG #Verge #bitcoin #crypto
7020 2018-01-01 12:44:46 Xvg Not mooning
7021 2018-01-01 12:44:42 The problem is, “new buyers” and people new to crypto don’t understand it and will tend to invest in the smaller alts as they see better profit margins there. If only litecoin could market it self better people would understand its potential
7022 2018-01-01 12:44:37 Hey crypto traders out there 1 thing you shouldn't forget..if there is no #bitcoin there won't be any shitcoin to pump and dump and make money. Make sure by pursuing short term profit you don't kill the most important reason for being in crypto
#unbankthebanks #bitcoin

7028 2018-01-01 12:43:51 Sell sell sell!!! She is dropping hard guys, failed on timeline, failed on wraith even the version released is a joke and the tweets are a joke. Should have listened to my gut. This is going to go down as the biggest pump and dump in crypto history

Happy new year everyone! 

2017. pretty much sucked for me other than selling my car and getting another one this last month thanks to crypto...

Hope 2018. is better, we’ll see...

7037 2018-01-01 12:42:17 What a dissapointment.
7038 2018-01-01 12:42:14 Sometimes people (who were present, that was most questions) would shout any clarifications to the MC but those wouldn't get recorded of course unless the MC repeated the clarification.
7039 2018-01-01 12:42:09 Je vergelijking met btc verleden doel ik op. Er zijn 2000+ verschillende crypto’s in omloop, dubbel aantal ico’s. De markt is totaal anders als afgelopen jaren. Geld gaat nu meer van munt naar munt. Hodl nu is anders als hodl toen

7052 2018-01-01 12:40:25 Did you know UASF went against the @bitcoincoreorg development process? 
Did you know that the NYA’s lobbied hashrate only committed to 24 hours of ideological mining of the s2x chain, hence why that hard fork was called off?
7053 2018-01-01 12:40:19 What crypto do you support then?
7054 2018-01-01 12:40:12 The article was a textbook demonstration of the Dunning-Kruger effect. A complete Luddite who clearly lacks the journalistic integrity to actually learn about the prodigious innovations that are being made in the crypto space and resorts to calling visionaries nerds.

7060 2018-01-01 12:39:18 Is that even a valid number?
7061 2018-01-01 12:39:13 @BitGrail Hi. Is the withdrawal limit only for btc or the btc value equivalent for  crypto's (eth, xrb) as well?
7062 2018-01-01 12:39:12 どのくらい増えるんですか？笑笑
7063 2018-01-01 12:39:11 Holding until 10$
7064 2018-01-01 12:39:11 Assuming (crypto) asset value eventually will determined by sustainable applicative value / (transaction time * transaction fee * transaction energy consumption costs) and not by panic and greed,  btc:xrb  or btc:xlm =  steam engine : Audi g-tron.
7065 2018-01-01 12:39:09 BTCウォレットを見ていていつも困ることは，

今回，2つの送金が纏められ，同時期に別の入金があり混乱。そのため未着金があると思ってしまった。
送金元にトランザクション情報があり助かった。

7074 2018-01-01 12:37:09 all these twitter accounts with "XVG" in it, are promoters getting paid to keep tweeting all the time about XVG. Do not listen to them as they will never feel for you, or admit XVG is a scamcoin or admit they were late etc.. It's really pointless. They get paid for that.

7086 2018-01-01 12:34:09 you guys are really smoking crack? It was released for MAC, and the price is tanking... what you have to say about that?? Of course you wont answer because you just can't defend it!
7087 2018-01-01 12:34:04 Verge communicates via Telegram, like many crypto companies. This results in low marcom visibility. Has pro’s & con’s.
They can surely improve their operations in terms of planning and communications, but people who hate this, might be in it solely for the money, not for the tech
7088 2018-01-01 12:34:01 Hey you guys that miffed on the $xrp run........A HYPER strong buy is $XLM .....thats Stellar Lumens for the dummies out there. GOOGLE IT! Use-case is your best friend in crypto market.....consider it your breadcrumb trail.

I think it'll be a long time before crypto cash makes it onto the high Street, but the attack on hard cash is well underway. 

The anonymity of hard cash and crypto cash (prob.) Makes it unappealing.

Can't remember the last time I wrote a check though I do have one to cash.
7100 2018-01-01 12:32:21 Don't like the fact that only xcpo has a (not very strong) team on their website.. You have any more info on this perhaps?
7101 2018-01-01 12:32:15 I don't think the above would qualify as pump message. I just think much of the hate is from ppl that bought at top and expected to magically multiply their money overnight without even the most basic understanding of what's going on in crypto in general.
7102 2018-01-01 12:32:12 100 JPY(BTC): 1147.492 ~ 1149.217 KRW(BTC)
7103 2018-01-01 12:31:55 This coin will be a penny soon. It could possibly get to 3 cents I think in 2018. This is a long term hold. But it could move fast. Who really knows in the world of crypto.
7104 2018-01-01 12:31:49 Well it happened to me. Crypto investments in 2017 gave me the money. I am giving myself the time. What am I doing with it? Buying land in the countryside, building an off grid house and getting out of the city. I'm investing in my health and piece of mind.
7105 2018-01-01 12:31:15 Man let’s stop lying to folks... nothing is happening not now and not for some time; if it even ever does
7106 2018-01-01 12:31:10 Probably just getting warmed up
7107 2018-01-01 12:31:07 Voted $ripple.because this is irritate those people who hate it.the more you hate the more will be interested to buy.
7108 2018-01-01 12:30:49 I have wabi and they actually have a working product. Expecting big things for them. 
7109 2018-01-01 12:30:47 Not doubting just wondered why you think it’s a scam?
7110 2018-01-01 12:30:19 New $CRYPTO trend: rebrand every shitcoin to Bitcoin "Something".
7111 2018-01-01 12:30:14 Crypto's as a whole did 4500% in 2017 and this year it'll have much more buying pressure but he is saying stuff like btc 35 and eth 2  btc will be 70k+ and eth will be 15k!
7112 2018-01-01 12:30:12 Just a guess, but everyone is relaxing with family today. When they get back to work and start chatting crypto may come up at some point... new years plans to spend money better might contribute. Who knows, I think it's all in the psychology of crowds at this point...

7119 2018-01-01 12:28:58 If you're going to be involved in $crypto, then at least spend some time to understand the #blockchain , what it will do, and the industries it will disrupt. Then look for #cryptocurrency that you think will be at the heart of that disruption

7161 2018-01-01 12:21:57 My ONE New Years resolution. To pretend crypto currency DOESN’T exist.
7162 2018-01-01 12:21:52 #Datum (#DAT) at the MC of a paltry $36,941,126 and #Modum (#MOD) with a MC of $115,801,863 are IMO the most undervalued projects in the crypto-currencies space on this glorious day, 1st of January, 2018.

7165 2018-01-01 12:21:25 people dumping $xvg and it is still holding better than BTC and the other alt coins. The force is strong with this one... they delivered enough for me to HODL. Good job #Vergecurrency

7172 2018-01-01 12:20:33 It did but now kraken isn’t taking crypto deposits , says need to increase verification when I have no crypto deposit limit.

7186 2018-01-01 12:18:19 you know a stealth address is not true encryption right? and this feature is available in many other coins with true privacy features and much better teams/ marketing, etc. also, xvg is already overbought, it has a 2.5 Billion market cap, which is too big for how bad it is...

7192 2018-01-01 12:17:30 I finished my accumulation with a big chunk on that dip to 1500 sat. Been watching some of these all time charts for months. $AMP, $BLK, $LBC, all sitting there for the taking. Love it.

7221 2018-01-01 12:13:41 I don't mind Bitcoin losing it's first place among crypto by marketcap. After all cyberpunks, crypto-anarchists and al kinds of libertarians are not a majority of world population

7226 2018-01-01 12:13:26 明日ですよ
7227 2018-01-01 12:13:18 They also just added that you have to do some work to obtain a stealth address. It clearly wasn't done or ready as they say they will be doing updates this week. They lied to people and you're now doing the same.

7238 2018-01-01 12:10:34 What does it matter if it was released at midnight last night or today.

7250 2018-01-01 12:08:32 Dude.
7251 2018-01-01 12:08:31 Are there any cryptos you think that might handle a serious BTC surge better than others? 
(I've begun taking profits in the last few days, I've traded commodity futures before but new to crypto markets)
7252 2018-01-01 12:08:27 Certainly possible. My crypto investment profits have probably covered for over half of my wargaming purchases this year.
7253 2018-01-01 12:08:09 I have concluded that on the whole, I find it far more fulfilling to throw my crypto money at Goddesses (down to one and only one target now for me) than buy cryptokitties.  Sex workers are real human beings with real needs.  Wouldn't we rather help them thrive?
7254 2018-01-01 12:08:06 ตอนจะเอาไปลง crypto คิดแล้วคิดอีก ช้าแล้วช้าอีก แต่พอมาเสียที่ grand Andaman ไม่คิดไรเล้ยยยย แม่ง
7255 2018-01-01 12:08:00 I'm not an export control law expert but I assumed it had something to do with the encryption export limitations, not supercomputing. @Riana_Crypto do you know?

7261 2018-01-01 12:06:38 people don't get it. #Verge is a one and only "pump $ dump" project, never will hit even 1 $ (John McAffe said this already)! Dev's goal is only to fill up own BTC pockets! you ppl like decentr private crypto, then use #XMR, it works since weeks and is a serious thing !
7262 2018-01-01 12:06:27 What if crypto imploded under a gov ban. There would be 0 pennies tomorrow to be made. Btc would die in a dumpster fire
7263 2018-01-01 12:06:03 You can only trade them for doge though at the moment, good for those learning to trade, I doubled my doge buy in...

7453 2018-01-01 11:35:58 If you're new to crypto then trust your own gut. Do your research. Look to some of the best for what they're doing but ultimately you will have your own style. Hold as many coins as you feel comfortable with and use the indicators that work for you. You are your best resource.

7456 2018-01-01 11:35:42 I've donated 480$ today, a 10% nett profit on my crypto portfolio. In november it was a 40$ donation. I just got myself 20% of the table from my $XRP coin, 1 of 6 coins.

7462 2018-01-01 11:35:03 @amitabhk87 Nice discussion / views on @DDNational on Blockchain Crypto currency Good to know that we are gearing up  @DDNewsLive @PMOIndia @narendramodi 
7463 2018-01-01 11:34:58 Doesn't the success of crypto depend on the integration with the traditional financial system? Ie., what Ripple is trying to do? It seems a more constructive approach. More users -> stable price, and then it's actually used for payments rather than mere speculation.

7476 2018-01-01 11:34:04 @nntaleb said that the measure of a text is the length of time it remained relevant. I wonder if the same might apply to the crypto space.

Je répondrais quand j'ai le temps 
7478 2018-01-01 11:33:17 With the new year, comes the expectation of something familiar, something remarkable and something unprecedented. In 2018, we meet your expectations, and then some. 
Happy New Years to you all and may all your crypto-resolutions come through.

7517 2018-01-01 11:27:13 Like what @Naval said about the top market cap ? “It’s disheartening to see how many of the top cryptocurrencies are hand-waving, technically inept, or outright scams.”
7518 2018-01-01 11:27:09 I suggest do a live Q&A with Justin once things settle down. .also release some videos on how to fix any errors if there are any like above..not everyone is tech savvy. .!!
7519 2018-01-01 11:27:07 Based on the revelutionary technology, the team, the financial backers and close influential contacts in the industry, the integration of assets already in use by 10's of millions, contracts yet to be announced, Crypto scene at the moment, fueled by pure speculation. All of above
7520 2018-01-01 11:26:48 how do you know? i tought that they will add it today?

 maybe verge decided to release an unfinished product and wait for testing/bug comments via github before putting out official press.
it's a possible explanation but a bad look if true.

7637 2018-01-01 11:10:50 Also #bitcoin is the only true decentralized crypto considering there is no leader and everybody has to come to consensus to make any change unlike other cryptos where the foundations (ripple,iota) or leader (Vitalik) have the final say.
7638 2018-01-01 11:10:47 Is there any news if the exchange will honor the fork? Or will we have to move to wallet, get BTCP, then move back to exchange to trade?

7645 2018-01-01 11:09:48 Dreaming the dream about how the future of crypto and blockchain technology will look takes every bit of imagination as the initial thought which had gone through Satoshi mind prior to composing his masterpiece whitepaper.

7646 2018-01-01 11:09:45 Not sure - there are some great technical traders but haven't found many who blend in the emotive aspect into their decisions. I like a balance between the two, it suits crypto. There are excellent technical traders about like @PeterLBrandt & @parabolictrav (my bear & bull gurus)

7710 2018-01-01 10:57:23 Totally agree. We're working hard to envision what the crypto-economy could look like and what roles we could have in it. It feels like the current "success" of cryptocurrencies in the legacy economy can distract from the real Endgame!

7714 2018-01-01 10:56:56 Awesome journey and success Peter. Seems to me there will be a few (less than 5) successful coins when the dust settles and in the meantime crypto is an adrenaline rush of a bull run to take advantage of before the well runs dry...managing exposure + taking profits being so key.
7715 2018-01-01 10:56:44 When you are in a hot speculative market like this, you can throw all economics and fundamentals out the window. They mean absolutely nothing until the speculators are done. You just lost 1 btc :)

7821 2018-01-01 10:41:35 From the scramble they had last night, looked like a bunch of last-second bugs cropped up, but seems to be ready now? Was really weird watching them manipulate the price with a single tweet right after they should have launched.

7824 2018-01-01 10:41:31 2017 was a good year, but 2018 is going to be a awesome year!!! In 2018 I will mention my thoughts on different big and smal coins. And then its up to you guys, make plan, sit back and let things play out. #crypto #bitcoin

7827 2018-01-01 10:41:24 Amazon has enough money to do anything happening in the crypto space right now. But this is not a reason not to invest. I would probably buy walimai if I were Amazon rather than starting from 0.

以前はホワイトペーパーがなかったことや進捗があまり目に見えなかったことによるディスだったので、この年末にかけての動きがしっかり効果出てるのを感じる。

7852 2018-01-01 10:37:36 I discovered your channel when you had 100ish subs. Your early Coinspot signup videos was what got me got me to dive into crypto after sitting on the side for weeks. Funnily enough the day I signed up was also my first day off after being made part-time from my engineering job.
7853 2018-01-01 10:37:27 Think to a world tomorrow where you'll be able to pay (mobile or card) in the currency of your choice using the crypto of your choice (or any other store of value commonly accepted and traded).
Stellar network allows you do to that in less than 5sec, and for less than a penny.

7879 2018-01-01 10:33:21 2. On top of it his entire discourse is based on high level technical knowledge and ridiculous capability.

Here is my 1st little contribution for you the cryptotraders poussins !

FA gives you the answer for what.
TA gives you the answer for when.

7927 2018-01-01 10:24:55 All I can think they didn't catch it it time and they thought they were coming out ahead. Who know's but I feel awfully painful bad for those who got money stolen. I know the markets will continue but many newbie like myself getting funds stolen, who will quite crypto.
7928 2018-01-01 10:24:41 If you look at my recent tweets you'll find one with a falling wedge on $BTC.  I'm waiting for breakout confirmation of that before entering a leveraged long on Bitmex.

8005 2018-01-01 10:10:36 The problem with crypto is that it is hard to tell secure from snake oil without proper peer review. Given that Snowden is a) not a cryptographer, b) not even a programmer and c) a Russian puppet, his endorsement means shit.

8017 2018-01-01 10:07:24 Research the backers of this coin. Some have been adversely mentioned in billion shilling scandals.

This may very well turn out to be a pump and dump scheme, but if you get it in early and cash out at the right time, it wouldn't matter.
8018 2018-01-01 10:07:17 10! your analysis is always very accurate, and you are always available to help the crypto community in particolar people that aren't professionale trader but simple investors....nice work!!! Hope your bags will moon in 2018!!
8019 2018-01-01 10:07:01 You can find studies about how men  cut off women's speech more often. It begins at kindergarten when the teachers unconsciously speak and let speak b & g differently because it is deep in the culture.

8039 2018-01-01 10:03:38 im new to crypto and lambo memes are already cringey..
8040 2018-01-01 10:03:28 Its going to dip and crash plenty over the next week, but the price and project are locked in, the market cap is gargantuan, its just gonna bounce back to a stable price repeatedly. So you'll have to scope out dips and short opportunities during the day.
8041 2018-01-01 10:03:03 A little bird just told me #Coinbase has a new years airdrop of Ripple access. My tip is buy now before it lands. Access = Rush = Massive gains #Insider #Coinbase #Crypto #Ripple #XMR #XRP #bitcoin #GetReady #IncomingWealth

8077 2018-01-01 09:58:26 Every news outlet seems to rely on Coinmarketcap to measure the size of the crypto markets. I guess the resultant underestimation is excessive enough, given meager liquidity. Poor 'ole Ripple is a paltry 100 bill without considering escrow.

8079 2018-01-01 09:58:19 How can you say this confidently? Do you have proof it’s not going on? And why would they not have the worlds 2nd largest crypto?
8080 2018-01-01 09:58:18 If you invest in a coin because you see it having value/gaining profit, but then freak out when a delay happens and the price drops and you wind up selling for a loss, I'm sorry, but crypto is probably not for you.

8100 2018-01-01 09:54:08 Ik ben ervan overtuigd dat het een gigantisch project is met veel werk. Er stond dat er nog een klein probleem opgelost moest worden en dan de aankondiging komt. Paar uur later maakt dan ook niet meer uit vind ik 
8101 2018-01-01 09:53:53 Exactly . I felt like I should always have BTC but since the drop I only put BTC to buy alts . TRX is the sleeping giant . I use bittrex and it's not on there 
8102 2018-01-01 09:53:48 Apakah buy and forget jga berlaku buat bitcoin dan koin crypto lainnya om?

8112 2018-01-01 09:51:42 Nice attempt at FUD there. Many cryptocurrencies have massive value / real-world use in terms of cutting edge technologies and technological development.

8122 2018-01-01 09:49:07 Sadly their is not a wide adoption of #blockchain to use crypto currencies for welfare. Imagine investors/people that like to give back can donate for social projects with a simple tx and also can validate the use and impact through transparency by blockchain.
8123 2018-01-01 09:48:56 Crypto has only just cracked open the closet doors.

8126 2018-01-01 09:48:26 Disons qu'avec 1 estimation a la louche aujourd'hui il y a quelques dizaines de millions de personnes qui deplacent leur sous dans les cryptos. Si a terme ya basculement de fiat a crypto, alors on passera a plusieurd milliards de personnes qui se battront pour aprox 3 million btc

8131 2018-01-01 09:47:48 ZLC ... TRX and ADA is the next big thing coming in Crypto ...
8132 2018-01-01 09:47:42 2009-2016 = mastering the tech. 

2016-2017 = spreading the word. 

2017 = the world now knows about crypto currency. 

2018 = the world puts it to use!

This IS the BEGINNING of a new phase of the revolution!

Happy New Year!

8148 2018-01-01 09:45:44 I know some people prefer to measure crypto wealth based on BTC but as for me I will stick to USD until such a time that BTC or another coin becomes a stable/reliable measure of value. BTC is way too volatile at this stage to use as a yardstick of wealth.

8157 2018-01-01 09:43:37 Eric I really respect your opinions. I am currently all in and afraid to go to sleep in fear of waking up to a huge loss and that if I put in a stop loss that it will dip down and than shoot back up and ill miss out, I know you can't tell me what to do but what would you do ?

And there will always be insider trading in crypto, just like there's insider trading in stock market
8238 2018-01-01 09:28:22 Then use your fiat loan to buy more crypto! What could go wrong?!?
8239 2018-01-01 09:28:19 Had a great conversation with my bro @BookOfKen 2018 is our year... power moves... crypto moves... Happy New Year everyone!!!
8240 2018-01-01 09:28:02 So really you don't know. Air heads you don't know what you are talking about

8245 2018-01-01 09:27:26 Happy New Year!! Yessss 2018 will be LIT 
8246 2018-01-01 09:27:20 Will Ripple be accepted to coinbase?
Who cares. 
Buy #xrp while it's still cheap and #HODL  
Ripple has created an amazing team and a even greater community. 
Once #XRP finishes testing and the bank start using #ripple will be  crypto
8247 2018-01-01 09:27:06 Please stop comparing crypto to tulips it just makes you look stupid

Tulips - flowers = useless

Crypto - math = life

#cryptolife #mathgeek #nobubble #hodl
8248 2018-01-01 09:26:59 That's from his bit connect referrals
8249 2018-01-01 09:26:40 #SEQ is trying to breakout if it gives breakout signal in 30 min chart 1st target would be 5300, It can go x5 in longrun. Safely buy zone 3600 3700 stop loss at 3450.

8254 2018-01-01 09:25:15 2018 goal will be profit 10k from crypto then road to 50k
8255 2018-01-01 09:25:10 hi you think it will surpass or match stellar and cardano soon? im also a big believer of verge’s technology from the beginning.
8256 2018-01-01 09:24:52 Happy New years crypto world!! Bring on the pumps and dumps.

8258 2018-01-01 09:24:09 There was a talk at RustConf this year about crypto in rust.  They found that side channel attacks were easy to avoid.  Do you have any more details on what you've tried?
8259 2018-01-01 09:24:00 @AndrewBitcoin @NUCLEUSVISION 
8260 2018-01-01 09:23:27 In 2019 Newyear lets see if xrp exists in top 100 marketcap...it will crash hard and this is a warning for for noobs...xrp is not even a crypto and it is proven scam...
8261 2018-01-01 09:23:02 Digital assets are still in the speculative stage. There is no logic at this stage. dot com bubble went to the trillions and i expect crypto to go past that
8262 2018-01-01 09:23:00 So even if the boys at #verge get wraith working, what difference does it make? Not one person will be using it with or without wraith... let me know when I can by a burger with #xvg and then I think you got something.... #bitcoin #crypto #litecoin #ltc #bummed
8263 2018-01-01 09:22:43 Its going up right now so hang tight. By the way, never go all in on one coin. Thats never a good thing. always diversify. You will get much better results in the longer run that way
8264 2018-01-01 09:22:34 Sell into what though!? The dollar?! That just performed one of its worst years ever? I feel safer in crypto.  If btc is broken and doesn't get fixed i will choose eth or ltc or xmr for profit.  The dollar does me little good.  Ty for reminder though
8265 2018-01-01 09:22:31 I put in all the money I had and all the money I was making for three months, and even though I was down (5k correction and not understanding USD vs Sat dif!), i kept on cuz I believed. Now I'm 4x and growing daily
8266 2018-01-01 09:22:30 Crypto 2018 is gonna be insane
8267 2018-01-01 09:22:18 I can’t register please i need some support (sbose703@gmail.com)I thought of buy some crypto but i am unable to register on ur website i was in a intent of a investment please help me oll

8311 2018-01-01 09:15:15 good work @verretor and it's a kind of cheating and fraud by @purseIO with their customers. they are still arguing with false reports. a company who are not even loyal with own business  and customers can not provide even near reliable services. they have thief mentality BEWARE !
8312 2018-01-01 09:15:03 3x late from a deadline is not a joke on crypto. Every secs matters. Dont they plan their timeline. They only move from last minutes. #xvg
8313 2018-01-01 09:15:01 Yes I agree. If/when this crypto thing pops(its gonna be the biggest of em all) those who have real assets to show will be safest. So difficult to take money out of such a bull market but its the prudent approach. Get the moat built first! I really enjoy the podcast, good for you

8323 2018-01-01 09:13:33 Most will. I would even argue that those new crypto millionaires will overstay their welcome and go down with the ship when it all falls apart. The real traders will emerge from the rubble and make a killing.
8324 2018-01-01 09:13:33 For all ppl who added me cuz of #cryptocurrency #xrp #ripple : I made a new twitter account for these things. Follow me @soup_crypto

8334 2018-01-01 09:12:01 Happy new crypto year... This is going to be crazy with so many new projects being launched and so many great existing projects in flight.

8335 2018-01-01 09:12:00 There’s always crypto to be bad
8336 2018-01-01 09:11:40 It's not really possible to be sexist against males @supahvee1234 as we are in an unequal society and men have the gender privilege. The incident above was sexist as the perpetrator was male against female. The hypothetical situations are irrelevant.
8337 2018-01-01 09:11:38 Happy New Year! A huge year of learning and growth in #crypto. Grateful for this growing community. Here's to continued success in 2018. 
8338 2018-01-01 09:11:29 You honestly are such an inspiration  to me....Your strength and determination should resonate within all women!!! Make 2018 the best!!!

8382 2018-01-01 09:05:08 prices are pegged to fiat and BCH is low, this mean average value of outputs should be higher than BTC, and, as a consequence, fewer of them should exist. In other terms, UTXO set size might be correlated to the price of the crypto.

8388 2018-01-01 09:04:13 This is why you should be wary of Cardano / ADA ... just asked a simple question 26 days ago ... "when will a linux wallet be available?" and the post was immediately removed and never answered. There is still no linux wallet for download... #crypto #trading
8389 2018-01-01 09:04:09 すごくわかります。私もイーサは信者なので迷いましたが、この前の大きな上げが気になります。仕手であったとしても、大きく上に行きたがってる気がします。今月、イーサより大きく上げるのではないかと判断しました。

8400 2018-01-01 09:02:37 $salt has the first working platform in crypto. #lend is tricky, no collateral for lender, no working platform, erc20 tied tot ETH and not allowed in US. That Lend is cheap doesn’t mean it’s good.

8429 2018-01-01 08:56:27 4 months ago I had no idea about crypto, I browsed YouTube & discovered Beau @Cryptos_Aus.
He taught me how to open a coinspot account.
Taught me how to research and make my own judgements. 
I invested as much as my wife would let me. 
He inspired me to make a YouTube channel...

8448 2018-01-01 08:53:13 This year is going to be a defining moment in the crypto community, and it is truly humbling how far we have come and it is staggering how far we will go.

8477 2018-01-01 08:49:22 Crypto 5 years? Is that suppose to mean anything? You can now predict that in 2018 it wont reach 100? I bet you my life you never predicted bitcoin ever reaching 20k in 2017

8514 2018-01-01 08:42:20 All I’m getting at is when the official account announces wraith it will 
8515 2018-01-01 08:42:13 I hope so. this does not look good. what a dump
8516 2018-01-01 08:42:12 Lgd starting to moon right now we just had a small obstacle stay tuned!!!
8517 2018-01-01 08:42:09 $zrx is moving up fast!! Happy to have gotten in before it’s too late #crypto
8518 2018-01-01 08:41:37 I am saying that it has increased compared to before, even though there are allegations on bithumb for price manipulation and korean financial services has shown concerns over the crypto market of Korea including willingness for complete ban.
8519 2018-01-01 08:41:29 Doesn't work
8520 2018-01-01 08:41:22 Probably

8523 2018-01-01 08:40:50 Very nice!
8524 2018-01-01 08:40:39 Firstly there is probably a resident why they haven't. Have you tested and run the files? I guess not...there are issues which users are facing!! So stop talking crap and wait for official updates

8529 2018-01-01 08:39:07 But for your ETH call, how long do you think it will take?
8530 2018-01-01 08:39:05 and #4....availability of ample funds ( or barter/bitcoin-crypto currency)..
Happy NY!

8533 2018-01-01 08:38:56 Sorry I thought it was photoshopped waiting for an official announcement.. I’m all in on verge sold my bitcoin for it wasn’t trying to be a dick just thought you were trolling

8536 2018-01-01 08:38:29 It's ok! There's no certainty in the market. Otherwise it's not called the market. Everything is still good

8538 2018-01-01 08:38:23 thats not a flaw its open theft
8539 2018-01-01 08:38:13 Thanks for the communication.... Sometimes no communication creates anxiety.... especially to impatient crypto traders like us 
8540 2018-01-01 08:38:13 why does my brother have so much fucking crypto currency
8541 2018-01-01 08:38:11 People used to men with suits making announcements. Here the community, the people, we make the announcements. Get used to new world where corps are ignored. We now know before them #xvg
8542 2018-01-01 08:37:56 Hmmm, no. Maybe if it comes back minimum 50%. Do you want to #HODL or for #trading ? If Hodl, well there is always a time to buy. I guess for trading you fin a lot of other coins which are more attractive and volatil
8543 2018-01-01 08:37:51 Showerthought: If all everyone ever trades are limit buy/sells at what they believe is fair price, wash and spoof fraudsters will get rekt in no time. Too bad nobody actually has a clue about the "fair price" of crypto.
8544 2018-01-01 08:37:51 Most crypto enthusiasts are either dramatic, delusional or other
8545 2018-01-01 08:37:46 Wish you all the best for 2018! Let the $neo 2018 party begin $btc $eth $xrp #crypto

8551 2018-01-01 08:37:13 Why the hate? Do your research. Has got 0 to do with the amount of followers. #VVraith has been compiled and uploaded on Github. It is being used by users as we speak. Issues have been found and solved as we speak. Yes, its out! Don't be an ass. Love. #XVG #Wraithprotocol.
8552 2018-01-01 08:37:10 I actually went with my hunch and didn't put a zilch in it . My psychic powers aren't rusty any more!
8553 2018-01-01 08:36:48 In my opinion they have both peaked in their pump and won't pump for a while.

8556 2018-01-01 08:36:13  I actually tot is was a type of crypto coin.
8557 2018-01-01 08:36:13 Which exchange?
8558 2018-01-01 08:36:11 @mredkavalee @ashwilliams1 I hear you guys might be interested in talking #Crypto sometime! Let me know!

1. Buy some $DRGN, $vibe, $dbc and $ELTCOIN.
2. Watch them all significantly pump throughout 2018.
3. Pay your respects to Crypto @cryptomoongod.
4. Get lit.

8567 2018-01-01 08:35:08 Crypto community misses the point and lives in their bubble. Majority of new investors are here to only make money. People that care about decentralization are minority. That's why coin like XRP can succeed and overperform bitcoin.  $btc $ltc $eth #crypto
8568 2018-01-01 08:35:01 its a massive korean exchange you can buy crypto coins, if it gets announced that they get on the exchange XVG  to the moon

8574 2018-01-01 08:33:40 Im sorry for this embarrassing call. This is has become the king of shit coins. I will never invest is such junk. I will make it up to. ETH is about to have a very important EMA crossing. Put money in that right now and you will not regret it. Its about to take off.
8575 2018-01-01 08:33:31 Will be seeing Santorini in July. Any tips welcome!
8576 2018-01-01 08:33:28 @Paytm You should seriously consider to start issuing crypto-currency based wallet cards.
8577 2018-01-01 08:33:26 @AlexChoOfficial happy new year, man! Best of luck, trading! Or should I say best of knowledge ;D

8580 2018-01-01 08:33:11 あはは、騙されたw
8581 2018-01-01 08:33:10 Yeah cos it’s seems that the verge team had lots of time to create fake profiles and promote this nonsense
8582 2018-01-01 08:33:07 Can we celebrate the new year with 2xp 2weponxp 2x liquid divinium and 2x crypto keys
8583 2018-01-01 08:33:04 (実はよくわかってない人) あとバイトコードで動かすから速いとか。
あとウェブブラウザに簡単に統合できるようになるとかって話も聞いたことあるね。(EWasmサポートすればウェブブラウザから直にEthereum触れるように？)
8584 2018-01-01 08:33:02 おめでとうございますw更なる活躍を期待いたしますw

8588 2018-01-01 08:32:26 It’s a big problem for Bitcoin/crypto businesses. I have not heard of buyers/traders being shut down
8589 2018-01-01 08:32:21 New year new signs!!!!!
8590 2018-01-01 08:32:17 Do you know the guy he standing with him?
8591 2018-01-01 08:32:14 crying like a bitch, but these are tears of joy. #crypto has literally changed my life and given me, a kid from the gutter, a life far greater than I could have ever expected. here's to 2018, a debt free life, and a grind that literally saved my life.
8592 2018-01-01 08:32:07 Amen brother got in at .0027c here   Sitting on 7000+% gains.  
Verge ain't got no chill lately and neither do some people... in saying that any danger of it going to a $2 as I would like to quit work so I can moon & Lambo 
 
Man I love crypto lol 
8593 2018-01-01 08:32:04 
8594 2018-01-01 08:31:39 Look at this sexy piece of shit!

8596 2018-01-01 08:31:09 Happy new year from SF! 

Let this be the year we become Crypto Rich.
8597 2018-01-01 08:31:08 How is one crypto a higher risk than another? xvg has a 3B marketcap and has in no way a lower risk than sumo...
8598 2018-01-01 08:31:07  Happy New Year to everyone except whoever came up with the security and boarding gate flow at Tegel
8599 2018-01-01 08:30:58 Try understand that if a tech is solid few days don’t change anything. Im in #btc since 2010 and have seen lot worse. Dont put #crypto on the same floor of pinkOTC
8600 2018-01-01 08:30:50 Ain’t that the truth
8601 2018-01-01 08:30:47 New year and bitcoin will go 20k plus(at least) sneak coins are doge(at .009 of a penny) and verge(at $.20) watch for them to make big gain this year #Crypto

8603 2018-01-01 08:30:42 $LGD UPDATE: This is by far the worst call and the worst investment I have ever done. $LGD is truly a shit coin of shit coins. If this coin cant go up on THE BIGGEST PARTY of the year THEN NOTHING EVER WILL MAKE THIS COIN GO UP. Sorry guys for putting $ into this piece of shit.

8605 2018-01-01 08:30:13 You don't need to c/p messages. U can also retweet the tweets of #xvgwhale if you like them. That looks more serious.
8606 2018-01-01 08:29:55 I don't mean to shill, but $BCO seems like a good long term hold.
8607 2018-01-01 08:29:47 What happen to the hiring people for job?
8608 2018-01-01 08:29:46 We already know Shors algorithm is "harder" to implement than originally expected, and will take decades to work at sufficient scale.  That has motivated much more interesting nearer term applications.  No need to focus on crypto at all.

8610 2018-01-01 08:29:32 Ronnie do you really believe youre a crypto guru? From what I can tell you have zero understanding about any of the technology other than the price pumps. Its immoral that you are accepting this title.

8623 2018-01-01 08:28:23 船頭となる人がいないんじゃ、だれが普及を後押しするんでしょうね。責任の所在が不明なものをだれが運用するんでしょうね。Googleの普及の段階で中央集権かどうかってだれが気にしたんでしょうね。中央集権は普及のスピードを早めるんじゃないかと思います
8624 2018-01-01 08:28:18 1777 Sats and up...      But seems like it will take a few days/weeks to get to my highest sell orders..     tonight was a disappointment of EPIC proportion..     Oh Well..   At least it's 2018, and it's gonna be a HELL of a year in CRYPTO!!
8625 2018-01-01 08:28:13 Not much pump for now..!! Those few hours were key. Anyway we got it finally and ppl should stop calling this scam. .!
8626 2018-01-01 08:28:05 理解しました！！たしかに今BTC使いにくいですしね！
おおお、グローバル展開ですね笑！！
8627 2018-01-01 08:27:52 I wonder if banks' grand scheme for crypto is to get high risk clients to invest there so that if crypto does fail those risks are wiped out blamed on an unregulated economic system. If successful banks become power players. The heist don't end with the GOP Tax Bill becoming law.

8631 2018-01-01 08:27:03 今年初記事を何にするか悩むな
8632 2018-01-01 08:27:01 Thanks man! Glad you found my vids useful 
8633 2018-01-01 08:26:51 @arunjaitley ultimately crypto traders are gonna spend their earned money..blocking by banks is mindless move if it is initiated by ministry
8634 2018-01-01 08:26:46 It clearly can't. In addition to the hacking potential of both wallets and the crypto itself and that computers will get fast enough to crack it, there are finite amounts of bitcoin. Worse case, it'll run out and that'll be that, if not well before then.
8635 2018-01-01 08:26:33 I hope your rite one way or the other 
8636 2018-01-01 08:26:16 Agreed. I was also around $10. Hard to accurately predict though...

8660 2018-01-01 08:23:14 確かにBTC建ての板確認でもいいかもですね！
送金手数料の高さと送金の遅さがあるので僕はBTCは使わず基本ETHな感じです

ちなみに筋肉コインが唐突に上がり出して損失取り返せました笑笑
あと外人さんから英語で記事書いて宣伝してくれというリプが来て笑いますw
8661 2018-01-01 08:23:12 IXT上がり始めた
8662 2018-01-01 08:23:05 You should buy some EmberCoin

国家と共栄するのであれば、国の発展に持続的に貢献(納税)しつつ、社会を支える必要が有ります。

持続的な部分が満たせませんが、長期ホルダーもいずれ納税する事になるので、最終的には、一致するのかなぁ〜と思います。

8864 2018-01-01 07:50:29 Read about EthLend symbol LEND. It doesn't have competitors. Only one other loan company called salt which doesn't do as much work as EthLend because LEND loans out crypto not only cash which is more option. This is one of the the few crypto that went up in price after release.

この動きは、おそらく今年も続くのではと思う。

9094 2018-01-01 07:10:57 To all noobs, don't chase every coin that's been tweeted. You will either get rekt, or stretch your capital too thin. Invest in what you believe in, and trade others. When an OG tweets, many will run for the door. Wait, research, decide and time your entry. #crypto $btc $Eth

9097 2018-01-01 07:10:36 Wow that's fantastic,  Blockchain aka #Crypto is meant for revolutionizing payment method,  not monopolizing it by giving mandate to only #bitcoin & there miners to exploit.  
Good to start with #BitcoinCash . I assume more would be coming soon. Like to have some competition.

9101 2018-01-01 07:09:29 Happy New Year and to a Wonderful and Prosperous New CRYPTO Year
9102 2018-01-01 07:09:28 The last conference I went to used a gong for speakers who went over their time and it worked beautifully.
9103 2018-01-01 07:09:14 Late 2017 I had a small stack of cash to get started in $crypto. It was a good start. Had a few really sweet wins, lots of losses, and closed with a much better position than I thought I would have in just these few short months. Now, 2018 I hodl, watch, and continue to grow.
9104 2018-01-01 07:09:07 Fun Fact: Auld Lang Syne was written by Robert Burns who stayed within a ten minute drive from where I type this message now. Happy new year to Rabby Burns.
9105 2018-01-01 07:08:31 Grow yourselves some balls or get out of crypto. It's uncharted territory, it's crazy, if you let your emotions and fear control, then you WILL lose all of your money. But hold....and without a full market crash YOU WILL profit greatly. As easy as that.
9106 2018-01-01 07:08:21 A ton a random dudes in their mid 20’s became millionaires $$ in 2017.

9112 2018-01-01 07:07:13 Asking for proof based on one anecdote is like asking for proof that cigarettes cause cancer based on one patient. It's not a reasonable ask.
9113 2018-01-01 07:07:10 When it comes to tech you need Tech visionaries like Gates,Jobs, Bezos or Musk who can see future. As Buffett or Munger say rear view mirror is clearer than windshield. They have not had a single tech prediction to their credit. It’s unwise to seek their advise on Tech.
9114 2018-01-01 07:06:59 中央集権型のFiat currencyでは個人と民間銀行の関係では銀行だけが資金の10倍を貸し出せる不公平だった。これがCryptoによりお墨付きが一国家ではなくなるので、不公平が無くなってくる。極端な話、円取引は個人と政府銀行のみでOKで民間銀行は淘汰されていく。

9124 2018-01-01 07:06:10 Gonna follow a bunch of new 'golf people' this week, then inevitably & steadily unfollow most of them as they: deliver no value, yap abput crypto-currency or mention religion. 
9125 2018-01-01 07:06:06 True. Maybe i should cash out and get whatever profit i can get instead of slowly become poor.
9126 2018-01-01 07:06:01 I'm playing with profits, man. Many new people are coming into crypto and not all are using play money. But hey! If Verge is your coin, good luck. Everyone has their favorites.
9127 2018-01-01 07:05:57 Nothing is guaranteed my friend... Investing is legalized gambling with cryptocurrency being the highest form of risk.

9131 2018-01-01 07:05:04 Well im not going back to their website since you can do that so could be a bit off but pretty sure their ceo has already built an exchange (for fiat) that has delt with trillions of dollars worth of transaction (gvt's goal) and the changelly founder or ceo is on the team.
9132 2018-01-01 07:05:00 What is target price ?
9133 2018-01-01 07:04:52 I find it difficult to credit you with genuinely wanting proof, since there are both studies and entire books about male/female communication patterns. There's lots of it out there.

9158 2018-01-01 07:00:07 BlockチェーンとCryptoはすさまじい破壊をもたらしている。すでに資金調達では伝統的な株式や債券ではなく簡単にICO調達で創造的破壊を起こしている。この流れは加速していくので、現状の株式やFXはCrypto投資に歩みよらなければ、伝統的なStock Exchangeは淘汰されて10年後にはなくなっているかも。

9176 2018-01-01 06:58:25 I am not sure about ripple and coinbase, as I personally wanted this, there was coinbase reply ripple cannot be in coinbase as they have clear rules of crypto that can be. I.e. They had some problem of the Compnay Ponopoly over it. Didn't know if changed their minds
9177 2018-01-01 06:58:13 Verge has increased ten fold $XVG ?
9178 2018-01-01 06:58:11 @koinexindia please resume withdrawals as I have many eth incoming. Sellers like me can help your market grow. I am a veteran crypto enthusiast. Don't let down your early adopters.

9192 2018-01-01 06:56:35 2018 will be the year of the Twitter crypto touts
9193 2018-01-01 06:56:29 Not cultist but it’s suppose to give you the opportunity to make your transaction anonymous or not. So far, it has let me down waiting on the release.
9194 2018-01-01 06:56:22 Unfollowing you..  To much shit talking (marketing) and you are using someones avatar.  I did a reverse  search on that image.  Its not even you.  Plus your confirmed messages are stupid..  Way over the deadline. Wtf

9203 2018-01-01 06:55:11 actual 2018 goals

-join a decent team
-take on more irl and client projects
-finally take up designing
-learn guitar
-build a new pc
-hang out more and be more outgoing
-bring in fat stacks
-invest in stocks/crypto

9208 2018-01-01 06:54:53 Great things are happening with Crypto Real Estate. It's a new beginning and Real Estate investors are making great profits. A company just released an app and the price jumped 7 times. At RPT we have apps almost ready so some good opportunities to get in early and reap rewards.
9209 2018-01-01 06:54:47 Noway... im trusting them more than you  but I would not buy more and I wouldn’t bought if I knew this delay... my nerves are gone
9210 2018-01-01 06:54:46 The biggest thing I am looking forward to in #2018 is for #bitcoin and other #crypto to break even more records. #happynewyear
9211 2018-01-01 06:54:44 I understand. I set my alarm at 5:30 to be online with the release happened . Its the last bug so i guess it can’t take days for the release to happen. Still thinking about selling and rebuying at a lower rate but i’m afraid to miss the bullrun tbh.
9212 2018-01-01 06:54:31 <~~~~~~ Lost!!!!
9213 2018-01-01 06:54:21 Goal for 18: make money with crypto  currencies
9214 2018-01-01 06:54:12 地道な聞き取り調査の結果、今の初心者はやはりねむとりっぷるから始めるそうです。あとリスクって人もいました。
ファクトムを買うって人はいなかったのでおそらく誰も買ってないのに値段が上がる謎の通貨です。
ご精査ください。

9216 2018-01-01 06:53:56 Bitcoin Guy just is a better marketer than you and he didn't sell his position. Dimon is just a headline grabber and gets the spot above you because he says controversial shit and calls $BTC a fraud while launching a division using crypto trading... go figure.
9217 2018-01-01 06:53:40 @crypto_sarah9  hey!!!! Where is the #Wraithprotocal?? I was so convinced you were a triplet and a legit crypto informant

9269 2018-01-01 06:46:24 Don’t bother Albert. You are arguing with mindless XVG drones that only care for moon and Lambo memes. They even angered their (former) buddy John Mcpumpfee. Let them hold onto Wraith dreams while the rest of crypto moves on.
9270 2018-01-01 06:46:12 I hope it does, but is this where I get in line for the free 10,000 Verge?
9271 2018-01-01 06:45:47 Get a girlfriend, earn a shit ton of money from crypto so I don't have to work anymore lol.
9272 2018-01-01 06:45:41 Very Righteous and I tip my hat off to you 4 your contribution to the less, I believe the digital asset should be the meaning of people coming together and grow as #ONE #knowledge, #gestures or #donations.

9278 2018-01-01 06:44:45 That's the tale that people still haven't figured out. And sadly, we've only scratched the surface of people learning about cryptocurrency. It's going to be like the introduction of casinos when the rest of the world finds out about it.

if this had shipped like all ya'll cry babies would have wanted, your first transactions with the wraith wallet would have seen ALL your coin absored in tx fees. but hey, it's "minor"

9285 2018-01-01 06:44:08 私見です。55億XRPがエスクローされているので、価格高騰時には調整が入ると想定。価格高騰は、送金コスト及び顧客の銀行の利便性とトレードオフの関係です。投機商品ではないので、適正価格に収まるかな、と。千円で、時価総額は銀行株世界1位のモルガンチェースと同程度です。
9286 2018-01-01 06:44:04 what coin?
9287 2018-01-01 06:44:01 Happy New Year friends. Thanks to everyone who made 2017 an incredible year in the crypto space. To those who built real tech and delivered real value, I salute you as heroes of the cause. May 2018 be an even brighter year for human #freedom and #liberty. #blockchain #crypto

9306 2018-01-01 06:41:33 Happy New Years, #crypto people. Here’s my 2018 calls (which means January. Because a month is a year in this life).

$zcl ($btcp will be $300 min. Likely $800-1000)

$icx (dyor)

$wtc ($5B minimum project still at around $300M; half the float locked up in nodes like $dash model)
9307 2018-01-01 06:41:31 Predictions for crypto at the end of 2018
Neo - $500
ETH - $1300
BTC - $45,000
Vericoin - $12.50
Cardano - $50
Verge - $25 
Ripple - $0.25

9309 2018-01-01 06:41:02 I wouldn't ask that, people already feel there getting scammed
9310 2018-01-01 06:40:56 Sys?
9311 2018-01-01 06:40:51 I bought the bottom.. I've been in since under $1.50. Can look at every other move in crypto and say the same. Consolidation is healthy.
9312 2018-01-01 06:40:19 The delay on #WraithProtocol is definitely discouraging and perhaps not the best move for $XVG, but putting the marketing of it aside, what it will do for crypto currency will change the game and is still going to make Verge fake off. Stay hopeful
9313 2018-01-01 06:40:10 Hello my name Bana Bitcoin 8 years old.

9320 2018-01-01 06:39:25 Could the explanation for the pumps of $XVG, $XRP and now $XLM just be that it’s all new people getting into crypto and simply can’t effort the stuff like $BTC and $ETH? Because of that they buy bags of cheaper coins and that’s why they’re all pumping?

9339 2018-01-01 06:36:31 $XVG is not a religion, it's a digital currency and its technology has real world application, so treat it as such. It's not a god, and not a space rocket. Too many zealots and fanatics in crypto.

9388 2018-01-01 06:28:58 寸前とか言ってたらそのすぐあとに売り切れましたってアナウンス出て素直に射精です
9389 2018-01-01 06:28:48 I left the comment on the official Tweet "don't leave everything to the last minute" and I got swamped by fanatics. People in crypto are all like "you're either for me or against me"
9390 2018-01-01 06:28:45 You're sentiments are shared and valid.

In a few moments the official release will be broadcast across all channels.

Thank you for your patience and devotion to the team and project.
9391 2018-01-01 06:28:39 @6BillionPeople anyone following this clown should quit crypto lol
9392 2018-01-01 06:28:28 hahahahahha Same here.... Twitter to telegram then again Binance.... lol.... #XVGLove
9393 2018-01-01 06:28:25 I hope my beard gets even thicker, my crypto continues to grow, and I keep making gains in 2018
9394 2018-01-01 06:28:21 I'm just going to let XLM ride while I sleep, even if it retraces 50% it's been a good move from XRP to XLM it's pumping. As @CarpeNoctom shows, XRP still seems to be showing signs of life lol I guess don't give up on it yet. I got 25% still in. $XLM $XRP #crypto #binance
9395 2018-01-01 06:28:07 #HappyNewYear from the #Bitmora team. 2018 be ready, we're about to show the crypto community how exchanges should truly be ran.
9396 2018-01-01 06:28:00 Hell yeah
9397 2018-01-01 06:27:48 Drunk on New year's yet still thinking about crypto 
9398 2018-01-01 06:27:18 Yup. Bought some BTC and ETH in early 2017 for my parents to hodl. Myself decided to trade the shit out of this market. No need to say whose ROI is higher.
9399 2018-01-01 06:27:08 @justinvendetta  Thanks for taking your New Years eve and getting this ready for us. #HODLING

9430 2018-01-01 06:23:41 Scam, all these xvg followers are getting fooled. @officialmcafee McAfee got paid to pump this shiit hahah
9431 2018-01-01 06:23:38 Saw some ads for free electricity in Telangana in the New Year papers. 

How long until #crypto mining rigs come up on these farmlands?

#justasking
9432 2018-01-01 06:23:21 My early prediction for 2018 is Binance will become the favorite Exchange for Crypto. Their attention to users and rewards system is reminiscent of early poker days! #crypto
9433 2018-01-01 06:23:15 Crazy how these newbies get manipulated so easy. Probably next coin he manipulates I'll jump in on a dip even if I don't believe in the coin lol
9434 2018-01-01 06:23:11 Commenting for 10,000 free $XVG just in case I was duped.
9435 2018-01-01 06:22:51 @Mills_Light yo have you ever considered mining crypto ? Or what are your thoughts on that?
9436 2018-01-01 06:22:31 昔痛い目見た人多いからかも。
僕は1割XLMですけど放置してるからなあ・・
9437 2018-01-01 06:22:29 Hey #VergeFam #xvg  come on over to HomeBlockCoin. A true investment with potential. Lending platform like bitconnect. Only 28, million supply. With all your verge money, we could push this up 10x tonight. Lol. Get it @ cryptopia #BTC #Bitcoin #alts #cryptocurrency #crypto
9438 2018-01-01 06:22:15 The one saying it was nearly ready to be released at about 7pm est If I remember correctly... 221am here, but don't want to leave the computer in fear of loosing everything.
9439 2018-01-01 06:22:14 Dude you're a real dude, most crypto dudes are obnoxious scammers  but you seem like an actual good person and I really respect your opinions
9440 2018-01-01 06:22:00 This tweet is incredibly cliché however, I would really like to thank all of you for the incredible support, kindness and interaction I've received past year. The crypto community is a weird yet amazing one.

9446 2018-01-01 06:20:34 Yes why not! $ETH was at $722M market cap on this day, last year. More the crypto goes mainstream, more it would be possible for $DRGN to touch $23B marketcap.

9472 2018-01-01 06:17:49 You already know about it. @Sophia_TX_ has that potential. There are a few more that have yet to release their tokens. We're waiting to see how they do once the tokens are released to identify a good entry point before we make the call.
9473 2018-01-01 06:17:31 Was announced earlier that the official $XVG timezone is EST.

1159 EST has come and gone. Allow me to apologize for another missed deadline.

Know this: #Wraith is complete. Q4, 2017 was achieved for #WraithProtocol. Announcement being held until transaction fee issue resolved.

9490 2018-01-01 06:15:21 The true value of any currency crypto or physical is directly proportional to its limited quantity, and it's ability to retain value and efficiently, quickly, and inexpensively transfer value between parties.  BTC? not so much. BCH, LTC, ETH, yes.

9551 2018-01-01 06:08:47 i wouldn't say pocket, but the disbelief they create in a crypto world with so much competition.. that will hurt...
9552 2018-01-01 06:08:44 #Crypto roundup: 5. How XRP reached a market cap of $74bn is beyond rational comprehension. IMHO, if you own any, dump it while you can;
6. ETH is the protocol of choice for DApps - expect steady growth as @ConsenSys manages adoption
9553 2018-01-01 06:08:42 HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM NEW ORLEANS!
9554 2018-01-01 06:08:37 Adding some Gs of #XVG! Ignore the baffoons and fear-mongering pessimists and #hodl your coins. Treat every bit of #cryptocurrency as a dollar bill. No top 50 #Crypto will trade for less than $1 by eoy.

9578 2018-01-01 06:05:54 #Crypto roundup: 3. The market now contains nearly 1,400 coins/tokens, the vast majority of which add no value whatsoever;

9582 2018-01-01 06:05:23 Demonitization is a joke, when already your black money converted into bitcoin. Crypto enables your black money to move things around unless static swiss banks.
9583 2018-01-01 06:05:18 nope
9584 2018-01-01 06:05:03 It’s too early for external exchange. Foundation for community needs to be stronger first. Otherwise could lose control of coin
9585 2018-01-01 06:04:55 "You must be new here"

9625 2018-01-01 05:58:22 At an NYE party and the first guy I talked to described himself as a part time crypto currency trader. Now I’m going to immediately leave this party.
9626 2018-01-01 05:58:20 Gotta agree with it.
9627 2018-01-01 05:58:08 Wow, a whole $20.  Is this the state of crypto now?  All McAfee noobs into xvg, trx , xrp, with 20$ and screaming about moon. Hilarious.  Let me know when you get your big boy pants.
9628 2018-01-01 05:58:05 I hear you've dipped your toe in the #Crypto world @DHughesy, would you be interested in coming on the channel for a casual chat?

9630 2018-01-01 05:57:42 How many Satoshis are circulating? Market cap is the determinant of value, not number of coins.  Price of coin multiplied by number of coins is the true survey to attain relative value between crypto coins. Fact is Btc is losing.
9631 2018-01-01 05:57:37 I have a very good feeling about #2018 Lets make it the best year ever! Happy Crypto New Year Everyone.

9636 2018-01-01 05:57:06 Because I have been listening to you guys on the Bad Crypto Podcast since EP. 1, and you guys are really informative but you keep it light.

You bring the lols to the house, but also  ask some of the tough questions. U guys are doing a big service for the Crypto Game...

9637 2018-01-01 05:56:59 Signs of scammers:
1- Pretend to be religious and use the word god a lot
2- Take photos with Lambo or Ferrari and post them in ads
3- Claim their father is king or prince
9638 2018-01-01 05:56:52 Consolidation would therefore imply what?

9644 2018-01-01 05:55:11 They have been working their asses off tho. Its here hes just working out the final kinks.
9645 2018-01-01 05:54:58 Stay safe tonight crypto community!

9647 2018-01-01 05:54:30 Happy New Yearrrrr Crypto humans and non humans
9648 2018-01-01 05:54:29 But we are in the wrong.. They dont owe us anything.. remember that.. LOL ya ok... Crypto is full of scamming devs and if you want people to follow your on your quest, ensure trust.. with communication not with the lackof.
9649 2018-01-01 05:54:26 Something's wrong.. why are so many people posting fake links?
9650 2018-01-01 05:54:25 ??????????????? This is crazy!!
9651 2018-01-01 05:53:56  look what crypto has done to us
9652 2018-01-01 05:53:55 新年早々、仮想通貨のリスクについてや考えて行動しないと危ないよっていう記事を書いてます
9653 2018-01-01 05:53:55 送金時はETHにした方が早いし安かったので今後はそうしよう
9654 2018-01-01 05:53:54 素敵なアプリをありがとうございます。個人的にはXRBに対応して頂けたら嬉しいです。
9655 2018-01-01 05:53:43 Reasons I think 2018 crypto will be better than 2017: 

- Hedge funds and big money involved now 
- Masses of new coinbase users daily waiting to discover alts
- Marketcap will reach the trillions
- Projects have so many releases in 2018 coming up 
- We've learnt a lot this year
9656 2018-01-01 05:53:39 Try to learn more about my current hobbies, cooking, smoking BBQ, poker. Also try educate myself on new things like crypto, mining, other entrepreneurial endeavors and if it's worth the time to commit
9657 2018-01-01 05:53:39 In 2017, I started invest my money in #CryptoCurrencies. In 2018, I will start investing my time in #crypto. My new year resolution is becoming a #blockchains developer in 2018.
9658 2018-01-01 05:53:38 Why so last minute... so unprofessional
9659 2018-01-01 05:53:36 My 2nd one has payed out too, maybe wait a bit more then get on slack or Discord
9660 2018-01-01 05:53:27 If there are Crypto-Christians, why can't there be Crypto-Hindus. Change religion on records, avail benefits. Stay Hindu in private.

9662 2018-01-01 05:53:04 Happy new year #crypto fuckers, let's show that 2017 was only a small year compared to 2018! I want to see 2018 so high that 2017 looks like a small bump!
9663 2018-01-01 05:53:02 Enjoy FTL 
9664 2018-01-01 05:52:57 2018 we rly out here paying student loans off in full with crypto

9666 2018-01-01 05:52:47 I mostly use Bittrex. Their site works great but their help support is a disaster.

9676 2018-01-01 05:51:18 One more piece of advice to those listening. Buy Crypto. Buy it right now. Buy $50 a week at least if you can. It will make you bank. Search for ICX,  LTC, XVG and XRP. Do it as soon as you can and let it sit. You'll thank me later.
9677 2018-01-01 05:51:15 “Learnt” isn’t a word

9688 2018-01-01 05:50:19 @SudoDipstick what are your 2018 predictions for #crypto?
9689 2018-01-01 05:50:17 @crypto_gav How long after you set up your $PURE masternode did you start receiving $PURE
9690 2018-01-01 05:50:13 You are a disgrace, you’re only getting away with this is cause this crypto game is not watched , it opens up doors to you and ppl mcaffe to manipulate it , shame on you , ppl invested their life savings in that company .

9694 2018-01-01 05:49:21 i am new to crypto. thought prices gonna hit raise a lot after their tweet but unfortunately.... i might loose a lot of money

9699 2018-01-01 05:48:50 $PURE seems to be a bit above average now
9700 2018-01-01 05:48:32 Hey I only set it up last night! I think the current average is about 70 Mag per day which is half what MasterNodeOnline is quoting, it’s really hard to get the averages correct ,I usually take those with a pinch of salt, but it can work the other way too
9701 2018-01-01 05:48:19 If you are willing to gamble your life on a crypto, you have bigger problems than XVG. And if you did so at an ATH, well then... clearly this isn't your thing
9702 2018-01-01 05:48:09 Happy New Years everyone!! Its going to be an amazing and profitable year in Crypto!!!
9703 2018-01-01 05:48:04 Like you crypto currency skills
9704 2018-01-01 05:48:02 This is just damage control
9705 2018-01-01 05:48:02 ICOも結構分野やテーマが被ってきているので、よっぽど目を引くものでないと既存の通貨で良いですね、正直。

新分野はまだまだ注目されそうですけど
9706 2018-01-01 05:47:57 Whatever happens I am still a long term HODL on $xvg. Here's to a big year expecting big things from @blocktix and @enjin and @metalpaysme. Here's a toast to all my $crypto family out here on the grind to bring the future!

9711 2018-01-01 05:47:35 Thanks Charlie, I have a lot of faith in litecoin, love the fact that it represents Vegeta in the crypto world. I think it's a long term investment so let's see what the future brings 
9712 2018-01-01 05:47:29 Holy shit your all h children have some patience if you didn't see this coming then you are naive. Releasing advanced software to the mass public takes tweaks. Who cares if u invested cuz u believed them then u have nothing to worry about. Unless u just a fake aSs crypto poser
9713 2018-01-01 05:47:21 People stressing about minute to minute while I already know I'm #HODLing all 2018. Relax and have a drink, the dev knows what he's doing and he's doing what's best from his standpoint as a programmer. He'll get it done, and get it done right. The moon is coming. $XVG #Verge #XVG
9714 2018-01-01 05:47:14 Although I’m helping people cut their cable bill. If you haven’t looked into it. Crypto currency will explode in 2018! Do your research and it could be life altering!
9715 2018-01-01 05:47:13 Happy new year everyone, lets bring best crypto currency to crypto :)
9716 2018-01-01 05:47:12 半分くれ

9718 2018-01-01 05:46:54 patience is a virtue, we are here for the long run, so if wraith comes today tomorrow or yesterday, it doesnt care, it must be work and gives a true value, only then we can win otherwise we make some profit but the project is rubbish. we have all hope, lets make crypto big again
9719 2018-01-01 05:46:53 @vergecurrency @justinvendetta Never doubted for a minute.  Been rocking with y'all since I got into crypto.  

The hard work and dedication is what makes this community.

Thanks for the hard work.  Enjoy the fruits of your labor!!  Y'all deserve!!
9720 2018-01-01 05:46:32 D:
A sincere note to all, Crypto world or Stock world though there are few millionaires and billionaires made now & then, it is a very cruel place to be, as Warren Buffet once said market is a place where money flows from the impatient to the patient.
9721 2018-01-01 05:46:19 to all your cry babies this is the wild west, the dawn of crypto!!  if you dont like a delay to make a program solid then do this, get in your rocket ship, travel back to the gold rush days, mine some real gold ! maybe loose ur life or a limb. then see how grand crypto is
9722 2018-01-01 05:46:09 It’s ok I got $KORE too, that’s on bittrex and hasn’t pumped yet

9724 2018-01-01 05:46:00 Most asset classes have systems in place to help them *safely* inflate, i.e. derivative markets 100x underlying. This is absent from crypto, thus far. Something to watch for in 2018, along with solving the custody problem.

9728 2018-01-01 05:45:15 If you had it in the NXT wallet it is there. Need to download Ardor (use your NXT passphrase). If it was on an exchange then that's up to the exchange to establish a wallet/market. Until an exchange does that nobody will be doing any trading...even us that had it in an NXT wallet
9729 2018-01-01 05:45:13 Day trade crypto, build my tiny house, travel to Iceland.
9730 2018-01-01 05:45:09 Now I wish crypto was centralized and have a watchdog and governments all over it , because of scams , pumping and dumping and manipulating its price like it was a penny stock
9731 2018-01-01 05:45:07 I hope the Canadian dollar crashes in 2018. #HappyNewYear #crypto
9732 2018-01-01 05:44:41 In the UK crypto is gambling (not a currency) so not Taxable. Fiat in > crypto > fiat out cant claim losses no tax on 'winnings'
9733 2018-01-01 05:44:41 I really hope I get this 
9734 2018-01-01 05:44:40 Weak hands break, strong hands make, 101 crypto rule. HODL, if you're one of the strong ones.

9756 2018-01-01 05:41:43 Lol yea...What was your assumption?
9757 2018-01-01 05:41:41 Tip for 2018: 

To become wealthy in #crypto , find a project with a somewhat low total supply, low market cap, and GREAT development team. Find a few and ride them to glory  $LTC $BTC $ETH $XRP $XVG $ZCL $ADA $CANN $DRGN $DBC $ELIX
9758 2018-01-01 05:41:40 法令順守を呼びかけたり、国税庁の法令解釈を発信する啓蒙活動が、税理士法に抵触するとは思えないです^^

9791 2018-01-01 05:38:37 Please learn the difference between utility tokens and currency tokens when predicting prices of #Crypto’s. Utility tokens will not ‘do a $btc’ they are not a currency. 
#cryptotwitter #cryptotrading #cryptotwitter
9792 2018-01-01 05:38:36 We don’t need people who advocate high transaction fees in the crypto community. They are completely missing the point of this movement. They distract us from the real mission. They are harmful at best. Privacy, fees, convenience, speed, adoption and decentralization are vital.

May I request our team to participate in Crypto conference 2018 our future designs to bring more confidence to investors.  We have many use cases which require much research in the existing technologies.
9808 2018-01-01 05:36:21 I put a sell order in on 1269 but when i hit confirm it was down to 1200. Luckily I removed my sell order quick enough. I’m hodling now until the release but probably longer.
9809 2018-01-01 05:36:12 Lolll
9810 2018-01-01 05:36:07 蟹味噌脳みその私の理解を超えたお利口さんで驚きましたw

前を向いて明るく、楽しくですね

新年早々お騒がせしましたが、今年もよろしくお願いいたします

9825 2018-01-01 05:33:42 Keep up the good work guys and happy new year
9826 2018-01-01 05:33:33 What a bad year :(

9830 2018-01-01 05:33:06 The rusted chains of ledger blocks

Three fold now that value jump
But now it is all gone

To the court of the Crypto-King

9844 2018-01-01 05:32:01 This is bullshit!!!
9845 2018-01-01 05:31:52 Everyone saying they need PR... it is decentralized. The whole point of crypto is that it has no central group controlling it. If you want a slick marketing team go hang with the bankers @ Ripple
9846 2018-01-01 05:31:46 So your job is done warming up people before midnight right? Now no more tweets? You guys aren't professionals. that's for sure
9847 2018-01-01 05:31:41 I believe people who actually wait for tax reason don't ''need'' to sell. We are too early to take profits. So they will probably keep buying more on DIPs until the intrinsic price finds the right value. Talking for all sound crypto projects, including XRP =)

9914 2018-01-01 05:23:50 Actually people will flee the banking system into crypto (and metals) when the next crisis hits. Confidence will grow as more people educate themselves about crypto.
9915 2018-01-01 05:23:48 Never happening

9949 2018-01-01 05:19:04 I just wana thank everyone using this hashtag and buying and and selling to make my crypto new year a success this was fun and im still unsure wtf is happening #wraithprotocol

If you have your money tied up in their crypto they most definetly owe u.. Owe u the right to be truthful.. Owe u the right to communication...
9952 2018-01-01 05:18:34 2018 the year of the crypto income
9953 2018-01-01 05:18:26 GOOD CALL!!! There are so many people always charting BTC and most of them get it wrong. Everyone likes to call 8K and you’re one of the very few that actually get it right. Congratulations and happy new year!
9954 2018-01-01 05:18:25 As in  Verge  price  is in the  red  now. No  mention  of  wraith  too. Developer  didn't  keep  his  word. Is that a  bad  sign for a crypto company?
9955 2018-01-01 05:18:23 All I want in 2018 is to trade and give enough awesome $crypto advice to get a #Vegas invite! 
9956 2018-01-01 05:18:15 Haters will be hating
9957 2018-01-01 05:18:09 you guys are full of crap just like @einsteiniumcoin buy the rumors sell the news pretty much.....that's a full of lies this whole crypto needs to be regulated
9958 2018-01-01 05:18:03 You're crypto rich.  Get the X.

9960 2018-01-01 05:17:54 This is it #VergeFamily. We are going #ToTheMoon. #WraithProtocol is here. 2018 will be a very lucrative year for us all.

Buckle up. We are breaking the stratosphere.

9962 2018-01-01 05:17:38 Why do people even put stop loss in on crypto. Something like xvg is always going to go up eventually. Especially at this price. Some weak hands and stupid people. Should have seen that pre dump coming though opportunity missed again! #xvg #XVGFam

9968 2018-01-01 05:16:48 @realDonaldTrump mr trump I am a big supporter of yours, but the new tax bill kills crypto trading. A lot of us are realizing true financial freedom thru bitcoin trading, please do something to fix this mess. #killingbitcoin

9971 2018-01-01 05:16:30 Lol why?
9972 2018-01-01 05:16:20 I think it’s a great protocol but all the trash talk back and forth has left a lot of people with a sour taste. Hopefully they will succeed in implementing it and it will pay off for the developers who worked so hard. Best wishes to them & Happy New year to all!
9973 2018-01-01 05:16:18 It’s finally here. #DebtFree2018 motherfuckers it’s finally here!!!! Let’s make disgusting amounts of money and turn this world on its tucking head

9980 2018-01-01 05:15:42 Any comments on what’s going on with Verge and #WraithProtocol right now??
9981 2018-01-01 05:15:36 You trade crypto - you can't go to the gym anyways. Or leave your computer.
9982 2018-01-01 05:15:25 Happy Crypto New Year!!! 
9983 2018-01-01 05:15:20 Mate, your call for xrp was spot on. Been following you for a short while and I'm confident to say that people need to pay attention to your tweets if they are to succeed in crypto trading. Happy new year!

9987 2018-01-01 05:15:03 crypto community...   do not believe this...  shouldn't this have come an hour ago...  they are trying to get you to buy back in so they can steal your money on the dump
don't do it!
9988 2018-01-01 05:15:03 Historic just tell the new battle comes. After that it will be nothing more then a memory.
9989 2018-01-01 05:14:31 Everyone, calm down. Minutes aren't going to decide the future of a crypto. Honestly...chill out

9996 2018-01-01 05:13:51 crypto is a long game (if it works sha). Example is me buying ETH last year at $15 or so, but I sold when it waivered. When it spiked this, year I was hurt so when I got back in, I decided to stay the course. Got in around $300 or so. Just imagine staying last year till date
9997 2018-01-01 05:13:50 Welcome to the year of Crypto. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
