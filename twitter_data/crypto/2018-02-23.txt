The people that own the “Exchange” is the correct answer!  

Most of the “Traders” lose their money on the “Exchange!”

That's the case with Crypto when you're doing it right. Hit me up if you need professional

36 2018-02-23 23:56:55 Why did the Kucoin steel my crypto? I transfer my Ether from Coinbase to Kucoin because I believed Kucoin, but I have never received. Only your AI communicate with me. "Don´t worry. You will received your money. There is a problem with Ethereumscan." 
37 2018-02-23 23:56:51 Ride these waves out people!
I think you'll find we are getting higher highs and higher lows so if you wanna do some dip trading I'd say now is a good time with less aggressive dips which makes it plenty easier

39 2018-02-23 23:56:45 And before anyone freaks out saying “He’s secret service” yes... I know that. The fact remains, the two suits are talking about crypto currency while a dude with a machine gun sprints past them and they DGAF.

43 2018-02-23 23:56:13 Smart Buyers in #crypto will buy  $wpr because its near ico price and you can accumulate more then the already expensive $ela you'll get bigger returns with #wepower , so go on and get some $wpr and vote on binance!

53 2018-02-23 23:54:29 Tal Rabin, Shafi Goldwasser, Jennifer Seberry, Kristin Lauter, and Xiaoyun Wang come to mind, if that fits the bill! (Unless you're looking for those who worked on pre-1970s crypto and are still living.)
54 2018-02-23 23:54:19 Yep.  They will blow their brains out. 
All will do it in harmony, so no currency crisis. 
They will all short Gold and shut down crypto too. 
Blowing an ever larger debt bubble.

65 2018-02-23 23:52:02 Argument makes sense for a biz;

not for a payment routing network meant to act in lieu of on-chain p2p permissionless network.

BTC on-chain sabotaged since Bilderberger, AXA global, Mastercard, Shillbert, Fed Reserve board, owned/funded small blockers took over & Jobs'd Gavin.
66 2018-02-23 23:51:51 If you’re a Blockchain start up and have lined up a super sexy advisory board, have the crypto celebs in pre-sale (before they dump) a question: how many of them are calling contacts to get you a meeting, get your MVP trialed or implemented? Think about it.

77 2018-02-23 23:49:56 The fractal action of bitcoin is truly mesmerizing! Take for example the blow off tops from June and September and December of last year. Then look at the retrace, the bounce, and throwback to the bounce. Looking pretty fractalicous to me. #bitcoin #crypto #btc #ltc #fractals
78 2018-02-23 23:49:39 The Substratum Community are lucky to have such an innovative team @SubstratumNet who are working on a project that will benefit the world. I don't say this lightly, on behalf of those who will directly benefit & those who will live oblivious to your achievements. Thank you!
79 2018-02-23 23:49:35 The Venezuelan crypto currency story is going to be really interesting when they use it to successfully circumvent sanctions. Diplomacy could be much harder without that tool.
80 2018-02-23 23:49:34 Thanks, closed out Alt positions this morning after last APPC pop. It was a nice to see green last 24 hrs in Alts after days of red, but sounds like a false dawn. Do u think it’s not worth risk, or can it be managed such that one can bail before BTC breaks 8,800/9,100 support?

87 2018-02-23 23:48:27 If you fork it and replace the token with eth, does the project work the same? If yes, you don't need a token.
88 2018-02-23 23:48:18 look at all this crypto buying after futures expires...lol...too funny...just imagine when a million more people get to use robinhood.

91 2018-02-23 23:48:03 3/and that's not tribalism nor wishful thinking. It's just being perfectly clear about what crypto represents (not just convenience in payment) vs what central banking is. Perhaps you meant future will be hybrid of centralized/ decentralized financial system, which I would agree

105 2018-02-23 23:45:07 2/But again that's just implementation of blockchain to existing product/system. What I disagree is on your point that there is not a hard line between crypto currencies and central bank currencies. Fiat is fiat no matter what form. Chris Burniske explains this pretty clearly

116 2018-02-23 23:42:51 - Audio twitter

139 2018-02-23 23:39:50 The first step for big banks to combat #Bitcoin and #crypto is to open up on Sundays.

154 2018-02-23 23:37:52 How many money laundering cases in non crypto?
155 2018-02-23 23:37:38 @Altcoinbuzzio XVG I am seeing some online stores in the U.K taking Ripple. I heard a Tech Recruitment Company in London from Oct 2018 only taking the top 10 Crypto and refusing Fiat.
156 2018-02-23 23:37:37 there is also a separate telegram for serious discussion. No gifs allowed.

158 2018-02-23 23:37:00 and at that point I will consider buying it.
159 2018-02-23 23:36:46 Let's hope so. I am a believer in the fundamentals of crypto. The fear is how the govt's will attempt to stop it and what impact this will have on prices.

161 2018-02-23 23:36:35 @NeerajKA is definitely the funniest person to follow in crypto twitter. The dude is hilarious and informative. I consider him a must follow if you're invested in cryptocurrency.. makes me laugh while making me money!
162 2018-02-23 23:36:31 At this point its just on wallets and that means you have to accept the post snapshot loss
163 2018-02-23 23:36:23 in that sentence specifically they meant investment risk hence "speculative" but yes, the overall tone of the paragraph makes it seem like they are implying crypto is their competition. But we knew that already lol. BoA stocked up on patents though so I think they'l be gucci
164 2018-02-23 23:36:23 The most interesting man on earth : I usually never buy crypto currency.
But when I do, I prefer xrp.
Stay patient my friends.
165 2018-02-23 23:36:22 Forbes gets it #btfd
166 2018-02-23 23:36:18 fiat mostly yes; check previous years m8
very similar n then boom
april 2k17 e.g. ;)
167 2018-02-23 23:35:45 I work in marketing. I agree, and I'll keep an open mind on ripple if I see those changes. Just tired of the ripple army noise. Seems worse than any other crypto.
168 2018-02-23 23:35:40 Ohhhh noooooooooooooooooooo, I'm getting picked on by Destro who no one givesw a shit about. This is a normal day for me, kid.
169 2018-02-23 23:35:33 thx mate n appreciate it truly

imo yes, best might be to have fiat on side n cut losses quickly

172 2018-02-23 23:35:14 Do you guys realize just over 5% of the world owns crypto. Can you imagine when 25%, or even 50% owns crypto? Forget the value, that’s when payment becomes reality! #onward

177 2018-02-23 23:34:31 Yeah... I’m still learning how to interpret EV... thanks for the suggestion.

180 2018-02-23 23:34:19 Why?  Anyone should be able to hold bitcoin.
181 2018-02-23 23:34:16 Are there any NYC based crypto projects/teams? Maybe going there next month and would love some meetup!
182 2018-02-23 23:34:09 Fast money seduces everyone. Beyond marketing, I’d also argue it’s still not clear what crypto as a technology actually does cost-effectively vs traditional options outside of censorship resistant value routing. (Well and wild speculation and kitties)
183 2018-02-23 23:33:56 @zebpay @zebpaysupport nice job zebpay not depositing other people people's eth so that you can dump yours!!! you people doing it intentionality with every launch. Hope regulations come soon and you doomed first.
184 2018-02-23 23:33:45 This is hands down THE most handsome guy in crypto. (In my opinion)
185 2018-02-23 23:33:44 1. not even close to dead now
2. panic actually starting shortly imo
3. not yet
186 2018-02-23 23:33:18 Way more satisfying that’s for sure
187 2018-02-23 23:32:59 Acho q o ser humano é tudo a mesma coisa há décadas com relação à medo/ganância. Crypto.é só a bola da vez.
188 2018-02-23 23:32:58 LOL literally the only crypto "first come first serve" ive ever won. Shit, ive never even gotten to a Discord airdrop in time

194 2018-02-23 23:32:21 I've been in this space for a while, and I still don't understand the negative sentiment towards new traders.  I respect anyone who is open-minded enough to invest in crypto, against warnings from friends, family, and the media.
195 2018-02-23 23:32:19 @CoinbaseSupport when are we going to be able to buy more that 4 types of crypto? I need some of these inexpensive ones. Thank you

201 2018-02-23 23:31:20 some fake news post about FB acquiring RDD
202 2018-02-23 23:31:19  cheers 
203 2018-02-23 23:30:59 no I haven't. That's a shame, but I guess the volume wasn't there for a long time (at least in crypto timeframes)... they gonna have to relist it when this project finally yields fruit and everyone wants it!
204 2018-02-23 23:30:54 First there was agriculture

Followed by manufacturing

Then oil production and refining.

The next economic revolution will be crypto currency and blockchain technology.

Whichever county's embraces it will be a the next super power.
205 2018-02-23 23:30:47 If you’ve ever been scammed

206 2018-02-23 23:30:46 I respect everyone trying to help others with crypto. What some people dont understand about @PhilakoneCrypto is he plays a specific shorting strategy. He plays the bear game and has a great sense at finding the tops of charts and then shorting the waves down.  Have great day

221 2018-02-23 23:28:15 Breaking bad except it's just a NEET trading crypto currency to fund his lifestyle
222 2018-02-23 23:27:47 Crypto is not about coin prices but about the amazing technology behind them. Someone who knows the prices of the top 30 coins knows less about cryptocurrencies then someone who looked at the code once. "Cryptogods" rarely even look at the prices because they are secondary.

232 2018-02-23 23:26:42 I got into crypto mid December (perfect timing right haha) and have learnt so much just going through the highs and lows that I feel confident going forward even though my portfolio is down. I have battle scars that will heal but now I know how to fight

235 2018-02-23 23:26:37 I don't think what I said was worth that long-winded response or the correction you felt necessary to make. "Windbag" comes to mind.

237 2018-02-23 23:26:33 Hey Bobby you know what would be awesome??? Getting our tokens. Rize is cool, but the FUD being spread right now is brutal. Team making this thing look sketchy.
238 2018-02-23 23:26:31 Lol. Just had to double check my sell order :)
239 2018-02-23 23:26:26 Been reading this thread since U originally posted back on 2/5 & subsequent updates, thanks. If we are in “denial” stage on 12 hr timeframe, is #1 priority now to preserve capital for bargain shopping post dip? Or is Alt recovery starting already & just need to hedge for BTC dip.
240 2018-02-23 23:26:24 Robin Hood crypto is the newest reason to buy the future $BTC $LTC $ETH and own twitter & apple stocks on the same profile
241 2018-02-23 23:26:19 Think of it this was if you bought at $25 and sell at (lets make it easy) $125 then  you are making $100, so for me personally to stay in this under those conditions, I would have to be able to guarantee that $BTCP was going to be at least my profit from each $ZCL coin.
242 2018-02-23 23:26:13 I doubt there is much to discuss. Money rules. Banks have literally _unlimited_ money. Again: if it was a treat - it would have been erased from existence.
243 2018-02-23 23:25:59 Like I've tweeted before, giving away crypto on Twitter for retweets and follows is the high school equivalent of buying the cool kids ice cream to sit at their lunch table.
244 2018-02-23 23:25:52 you mocked up an undervalued price
245 2018-02-23 23:25:48 Stay strong, both my parents are in bad condition I know the feel. Goodluck and Thanks
246 2018-02-23 23:25:34 
247 2018-02-23 23:25:25 Thanks for the crypto wisdom! The generosity of the crypto community when it comes to knowledge and wisdom is a continual pleasant surprise.
248 2018-02-23 23:25:23 Will be buying with ZCL profits  still deciding how much longer to ride the ZCL train

254 2018-02-23 23:24:55 In some countries, selling crypyo for crypto is considered a sell and is tgerefire taxable.

265 2018-02-23 23:23:44 You don't think enough people have already? People need to separate single actions from what a person is. Never done one thing slightly wrong? Throw the first stone then. This is just harassment. It's a reflection of the stone throwers to my mind. The chant of the mindless crowd.
266 2018-02-23 23:23:35 #Crypto Twitter officially sucks

272 2018-02-23 23:22:34 Hey, #BINANCE crypto peeps. You folks using the $bnb token? Is it worth it?
273 2018-02-23 23:22:33 I heard a major bank stopped the 3 -7 day delay for international transfers OVERNIGHT to compete with transfer speed of crypto. So, they have been floating all that money 3-7 days deliberately for them to use all this time!
274 2018-02-23 23:22:30 basically many boxes connected to his server on port 443 and sent bittorrent garbage, and the TLS library did crypto for the handshake on each incoming connection, causing 100% CPU usage on his (very old) server. this code keeps non-TLS connections from reaching expensive crypto.
275 2018-02-23 23:22:27 Just put some yellow on the chains and you should be fine.

283 2018-02-23 23:20:45 You definitely have the IQ of 0 because last time I checked people with six figures we're not arguing on Twitter about a $0.04 crypto. I think when you mean six figures you mean maybe $6k you spent and probably lost. Tron is still developing. You're just a internet troll.

312 2018-02-23 23:17:10 A lot of people who say “I make a living off of crypto” say it with the same pathetic pretentiousness as someone who “makes a living off poker” or “makes a living off dealing drugs”...Big deal...Regardless of how you make your living, having one stream of income is lame. #GrowUp

2. denial's already ended on lower timeframes daily n less
3. Market got accelerated quickly
Regular market cycle for most of #crypto market used to take 9m-1y
December took 3 weeks for that

318 2018-02-23 23:16:10 The only reason Cryptocurrency has been marketed so well to libertarians is because they were already so accustomed to being crypto even before blockchain was invented.

328 2018-02-23 23:14:55 Crypto can't be regulated lol. The CFTC's regulations right now are "be careful where you put your money it might be a scam"  They rely on snitches and paying bounties from consumers to track down any criminals.

340 2018-02-23 23:12:37 @litecoin BUY CRYPTO WITH CREDIT CARD!!

Ive been informed people have found a loophole in the credit card ban on crypto.
They are withdrawing money from credit card to betting app then withdrawing it back to debit card 2 purchase crypto

Whats your views on this?
341 2018-02-23 23:12:27 Much much bigger!! 
342 2018-02-23 23:12:19 This drama 
343 2018-02-23 23:12:16 How about you roast yourself for not realizing that the whole crypto market is one enormous bubble currently?
344 2018-02-23 23:12:10 Have a great weekend everybody ... time to do some crypto trading
345 2018-02-23 23:12:09 I know it’s Friday afternoon but can we talk about crypto currencies and the fact that buying into their market bubble isn’t considered a risk but is sold as a feature? No? That’s cool, I’m sure we’ll all get to it eventually...

358 2018-02-23 23:10:01 This will be the reason why crypto will be regulated. Thanks fuckwits

「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」があり，0.5BTC送るだけで送料が800円も必要になっている！
これまで，細かく分けて送ることで安く済ませて来たが，だんだん高くなってきているような気が(^_^;
365 2018-02-23 23:09:12 Those are good examples. But, you know that unprofitable companies normally don't do what they all did, right?
366 2018-02-23 23:09:08 I can’t wait for the next crypto street podcast . Burn them

368 2018-02-23 23:08:55 I've traded equities a long time. Typically equities with a smaller supply gain more value than ones that are diluted. If you want to argue past prices, NEO was $0.12 this time last year. Past prices in crypto don't mean much, and zcl is getting plenty of positive attention.

370 2018-02-23 23:08:38 With an alt season shouldnt we have to hit a ath for btc first? Or you think they both fly? If we still have to pass the panic fase on your sheet than 5 weeks is kind of fast imo. How do you see it happening?
371 2018-02-23 23:08:38 Just another reason why Tron is/will dominate in the crypto world and beyond!  I’m a firm believer in this company and project!!!
372 2018-02-23 23:08:34 Crypto!!
373 2018-02-23 23:08:00 Question - where did you learn how to program? Also, of course no human can beat a program to trade which spoofs all day and manipulates bid asks. This is HFT but with no rules. Highly illegal crypto were regulated
374 2018-02-23 23:07:52 I've actually got some stuff coming up where we are looking at building a custom payment system out with either XLM or our own crypto...it's for a very specific market and we have investors lined up. Wondering if there's a collaboration here vs re-inventing the wheel?
375 2018-02-23 23:07:51 @Landm_Marius Hello Marious, Crypto is going up? I am nervous , I don't want to miss it. Should I still wait or ? Please forgive me to bother you but I need to make this happen, I have lost a lot of money. Is the crash coming? or already happened, I am confuse with the times.

377 2018-02-23 23:06:59 One of the newer (small) banks in my country actually partnered with a crypto company to set up an exchange. So not every bank is hostile towards crypto. With a new generation of people growing up with crypto and current interest rates I'd say banks trying to fight it will lose.

385 2018-02-23 23:04:30 Appreciate this bud! Heads up!
386 2018-02-23 23:04:25 There is a direct correlation with his huge uptick in followers when he started his free coin sheet in early Jan

At that time,  crypto was at an all-time high and exchanges were shutting down due to volume overload.

397 2018-02-23 23:02:54 Possibly. I actually think  crypto will eventually replace money, as a scaleable barter system when this system collapses. Example, You work for Ford, you get ford coin, and in order to buy food, you have to exchange, hotswap for Wholefoods coin. And each will have different
398 2018-02-23 23:02:52 You such a babe Thoreau
399 2018-02-23 23:02:45 I think investors are a little nervous due to the recent spate of bad news regarding companies in the crypto space eg RIOT SSC. DPW is attractive because it is more they want to see the more

402 2018-02-23 23:02:04 Every coin gets pumped and dumped. Tron is like almost 90% of all current crypto projects. They are at the beginning levels. Trons main platform is about to be released so you can’t say they haven’t done anything. If they were many years old you may have a point.

430 2018-02-23 22:59:35 Not everyone is going to adopt crypto and that’s fine. The demise of banks will lead to a massive global financial crisis, which won’t be good for anybody. In all likelihood crypto and banks will integrate and coexist peacefully, which should be the preferred outcome.

435 2018-02-23 22:59:08 Yes I do. Everything is always overhyped. If it is worth it weight in mining rigs, making money off of it post fork will still be feasible. But thats not for a while and taking profit on @ 198 is solid. Bits in the jar!

441 2018-02-23 22:58:43 Charts   Over the past year I’ve seen ten trillion crypto charts announcing what’s about to happen. It never does  they don’t dictate what will happen in crypto. They’re a falsehood imo. If I’m wrong please tell me how
442 2018-02-23 22:58:43 Crypto like it’s 2013... we are pretty much at the begining and I’m absolutely not talking about value but usage and use cases. I experience new possibilities on a daily basis, how can I talk about a financial move while the future needs us? ;)

448 2018-02-23 22:58:03 You never have to interact with banks if you don't want to. There are a gaziliion different types of payment processors and methods to hold, store, and convert crypto to fiat. Crypto banks are coming out this year as well

454 2018-02-23 22:57:03 So how are they going to use their cryptocurrency?

479 2018-02-23 22:55:07 Did you chat with @mahlonjb about crypto at #geekbeers last night?
480 2018-02-23 22:55:00 Thats what i said. I unfollowed Philakone. Choe is not like that, i agree. Still follow him.
481 2018-02-23 22:54:59 Thanks birb, we're ready!!
482 2018-02-23 22:54:53 The court order was based on clients from 2013-2015 moving more than $20k in crypto. Otherwise they protected the majority of clients so far.
483 2018-02-23 22:54:47 You only pay taxes once you’ve converted back to fiat I’d imagine? As in I’ve never sold any of my crypto so haven’t gained any profit yet....

494 2018-02-23 22:53:51 Well if it all goes to crypto maybe. If I had that kind of cash I would offer to buy it so you at least know it is going to a good home :P
495 2018-02-23 22:53:50 Another great show!..I’m happy to see I’m not the only one who reads banks 10-K’s..it’s a good insight in how banks feel with the threat of crypto and what strategies they will take in the future. I also like how you cover “their side” of view. Winning by knowing ur opponent !

503 2018-02-23 22:52:42 Truth. Course with that whole Tron garbage you have pinned, check marks don't seem to mean anything anymore. I reported that one as a scam.
504 2018-02-23 22:52:23 I think you will have to wait until at least the 26th before any kind of crypto will rise drastically again. Weird times it is.
505 2018-02-23 22:52:12 sorry man , i unfollowed philakone. Went wrong on all major decision points and this shorting in massive leveredged positions to make 10 bucks in 10 mins jsut to show off. fck tht.

- Normally, when you talk to your family, friends or acquaintances, do you defend your point of view about #crypto and #Bitcoin? Or do you prefer to be silent, because of ignorance or because you do not see the other person open to these thoughts?

592 2018-02-23 22:42:51 A bit more than a year ago I started to read and somewhat learn what #crypto is, it was and up and down road, but I can say I feel proud to get in to it and can't wait to make more money this year!
593 2018-02-23 22:42:45 futures are not a realistic depiction of price, volume way to low.
594 2018-02-23 22:42:42 my hero. commercial diver here
595 2018-02-23 22:42:29 The the MC now.. how long have the banks been here compared to crypto? I'm not even saying it will happen.. but no one is talking about crypto impacting the banks at this time. Crypto BTC, etc has barely been here a decade
596 2018-02-23 22:42:22 渋い
597 2018-02-23 22:42:14 Im keeping an open mind about it. the banks may not like crypto but governments are not going to risk public backlashes like what happened in South Korea or go extreme like China. my guess is they continue to debate it for another year or more.
598 2018-02-23 22:42:07 お気遣いありがとうございます。

599 2018-02-23 22:41:55 Totally 100%. If they wanted, they WOULD have bought every fucking coin, every exchange, every developer and put the whole thing to the ground in a matter of few days. Please. Grow up
600 2018-02-23 22:41:53 Hope all turns well with the fam
601 2018-02-23 22:41:44 #PORNX #PORN_coin porn is everywhere, crypto will be everywhere so why not both?
602 2018-02-23 22:41:44 Great Choices bro 
603 2018-02-23 22:41:28 Your all stupid buy ETC best digital asset that performs like a crypto currency and can power smart contracts best bang for your buck your shit bcrap and overpriced zcash cant do what ETC could for 35$ lol hahahaha
604 2018-02-23 22:41:26 What you running in your machine? I'd seriously look at what AND is offering on the CPU front. Great performance for a fraction of what Intel is charging. Only downside is RAM and GPU costs at the moment are sky high thanks to Crypto farmers!

606 2018-02-23 22:41:14 wait you follow @RNR_0 ? Are you into CRYPTO?!
607 2018-02-23 22:41:09 Yep they don't give a shit. They'd rather have a low price for XRP, therefore having to sell more XRP to fund their core initiatives, and then sell products that don't bring in enough revenue to keep the company going. Great insight.
608 2018-02-23 22:40:57 Of interest, more cyber compromises by value than those occurred against SWIFT inspite of market dominance. Crypto exchanges and client tooling must get better
609 2018-02-23 22:40:55 @verified I want to get verified. I currently run Rocko’s Burger Joint and I talk about the whole crypto space on a daily base. Thank you.
610 2018-02-23 22:40:51 Yeah bro what about #lisk @LiskHQ
611 2018-02-23 22:40:46 Ummm Mister Dolphin, just check the futures prices.  People are beating the door down to get at this coin and buying around $5.   Upwards of $12 early January!
612 2018-02-23 22:40:36 Hang in there bro, we got you when you come back!
613 2018-02-23 22:40:29 If I was the Warren Buffet of crypto I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be a dick about it... Everyone has the same goals. Different approaches should be welcomed.  Not taking lunch money from kids here. Giving people time if they want it... and time is money.
614 2018-02-23 22:40:08 good idea
615 2018-02-23 22:40:03 @brockpierce Saw you speak at crowd fest investment seminar and saw The NY Times article about Puerto Rico . After arriving in wonderful Old San Juan much happier with your new focus. Restore, Rebuild, Relax. Tropical Crypto Paradise. Any good events in town?

622 2018-02-23 22:38:53 hope ur money and crypto is intact
623 2018-02-23 22:38:50 With $btc they take out the most trustless people in the business transaction....Banks, Govts, and People.
$btc is on its own on the blockchain.  2 people able to do a financial transaction without the need for Banks, credit cards, debt cards, checks, govt, and payday loan places
624 2018-02-23 22:38:30 MTL they will release their ios app this quarter. The youtube videos look very promising. A great way to use crypto for everyday transactions
625 2018-02-23 22:38:27 But, muh solace!!!
626 2018-02-23 22:37:58 Who said "exit all $crypto markets?" I vividly remember seeing the post, just not who posted it

631 2018-02-23 22:37:42 $ETC has got to be the biggest twitter pump fail in the history of crypto
632 2018-02-23 22:37:38 It's obvious it's not about price with the amount of coins out there.  You forget, investors can make or break
633 2018-02-23 22:37:38 good luck pump and dumping in a $200B+ market
634 2018-02-23 22:37:29 Ripple doesn't give a rat's ass about xrp. They only care about everyone buying into it so they can use that money to fund their core initiatives as a private company, selling their private products to all the financial institutions. Stop sugar coating it and accept it as a scam.
635 2018-02-23 22:37:23 So there harnessing crypto power for weapons?
636 2018-02-23 22:37:16 Your exits are another traders entry and vice versa. One scrapes the cream, while the other gets creamed.

637 2018-02-23 22:37:15 An assault rife ban would be bullish for crypto 
638 2018-02-23 22:37:12 T-minus one week until I get treated like a win for crypto to me on Xbox live.
639 2018-02-23 22:37:11 What if AI created crypto currency as a replication vector? We are dedicating so much energy and processing power for a merely speculative economic incentive. @internetofshit @cstross @bengoertzel
640 2018-02-23 22:37:04 Well, it's the first time all governments around the world want regulate crypto gains at the same time.
I think banks and governments don't wanna bank crypto, they wanna ban the possibility of regular Joes becoming richs in short time.
641 2018-02-23 22:36:46 Slow week in trading ..not bad tho . I took some gains on $byoc and $andi. Increased my positions on $rjdg and $sgdh. Hoping pot sectors come back to life soon $rsii $gldff $rmhb. Crypto also good to me picked some LTC up on a dip and up have seen nice gains. What's ur picks?
642 2018-02-23 22:36:39  16:36 2/23/2018

645 2018-02-23 22:36:26 Bitcoin does not want to compete in a world of trust, lol, that is why it created the world of "trustless" :)
646 2018-02-23 22:36:15 Keep up the good work bro! One of my favorite, most unbias, and chill crypto news casters out there. I recommend you in all my educational material to my friends. Hope you had a great time #FinancialFreedom
647 2018-02-23 22:36:14 Yes it's very cryptic, almost like you need a mining machine to find the password to crypto riches... Jk
648 2018-02-23 22:35:53 Truth being told, this kinda concerns me. This guy basically screamed for people doing this to him when he gave shit to @daytradernik and in the end, they succeeded.

While we may gloat now, technically this is not a good lookout for crypto and personal security.
649 2018-02-23 22:35:47 Crypto...Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha omg ha ha ha ha you total moron ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .....ha hahahhahahhhhdaaaa....wow.....

655 2018-02-23 22:34:42 Crypto as a whole won't fail.  Blockchain is revolutionary technology.  Projects with real use cases and solid backing will continue, even if cryptocurrencies fail to make banks obsolete.

661 2018-02-23 22:34:15 agree...i think you need some regulation to pull big institutional money into crypto. it won't be much but enough to make it more attractive to bigger investment funds.

669 2018-02-23 22:33:14 Nice one, jump on the Discord if you have any trouble setting up, but it’s one of the easier ones as it’s a full bash install script, rewards going up in less than 2 weeks is good time to join :)
670 2018-02-23 22:33:06 Crypto bonds. Then we’re talkin
671 2018-02-23 22:33:03 Somebody will create a decentralized crypto and USD backed bank using AI to verify creditworthiness and hubs for liquidity. ICOs replace IPOs. Then the dollar will implode with the economy and nobody is there to bail out the banks.  Now we talkin.
672 2018-02-23 22:32:58 I started into crypto trading in a very similar... actually almost exactly how you did.  Almost same timing and with litecoin to get started with good profits then to binance. it's cool you are sharing what you know and being positive. Easy for the veterans to point fingers. Rude
673 2018-02-23 22:32:57 Nice

682 2018-02-23 22:31:51 The court case dealt with 2013-2015 reporting of $20k in annual transactions. So if you bought 10k and then sold 10k of crypto through coinbase in a calendar year - you just met the threshold. I'm not sure if anything changed for 2016 and 2017.

694 2018-02-23 22:30:20 My guess: bankers cry their usual crocodile tears of the dangers of crypto to the common man they like to rip off. Countries will make it less 'Wild West' and focus on tax but BTC keeps marching. I'd say long term reg.= more volume (adoption), less volatile. Interesting times.

cuz crypto deeply f*cks anyone else.
you know google? i don't care.
707 2018-02-23 22:28:58 agree - this is the main point of crypto : govt sand central bankers may not be worried yet, but let’s see how things stand in a few years from now!
708 2018-02-23 22:28:55 Todo el mundo callo en la mentira de trx. Ahora hay que guardar la borsa asta que sea tiempo de cambiarla por btc . Es una buena lecion esta para lo que compran por emoción. Hoy trx es numero 16 en market cap . Le fartan 13 billones . Y el uso que tiene no es 100% real 
709 2018-02-23 22:28:45 That's what I said also. Heard your call. Marla Wasn't your question re crypto currency, not camming?
710 2018-02-23 22:28:44 goddamit we let #bloomberg get the handle @crypto ? fucking really? now they have @business AND @crypto ? awful
711 2018-02-23 22:28:43 Technically, China is in play. They gave a seal of approval to TRX. I think it's understood China is just promoting crypto from the inside.
712 2018-02-23 22:28:41 Well. There is more to it than just revolution. Crypto will be integrated for sure. But that takes a while (just consider the two oldest generations must gone) YOUR BOSS paying you in crypto in your crypto account which involves tax and so on. Millions of jobs lost
713 2018-02-23 22:28:39 Seen it thanks. Wake up? Err, that's an opinion. You just hate people with alternative views don't you? I pity you. When all the good journos, politicians, public servants, etc that still exist are gone you'll hate the world you are left with. Byeee.
714 2018-02-23 22:28:37 Agree, @DTube_Steem seems to be attracting a good amount of Youtubers lately because of the monetisation issues and the rise of Crypto.

720 2018-02-23 22:27:54 Entered the crypto world at the highest peak ever (Dec 2017) and have lost money ever since! Am holding courageously and buying more every time there's a dip. Making a large investment in ETH mining and working on a few ICOs with people more experienced than me.
721 2018-02-23 22:27:46 you are a crypto youtuber. stick to the videos /s
722 2018-02-23 22:27:40 To my mind top 15 in crypto for me are: @Cryptologist100 @CryptoLeee @cryptotheque @DiaryofaMadeMan @JewKorean @Crypto_Brahma @CryptoGat @Crypto_Ed_NL @MindYourCoins @gip_crypto @PeripheraI @CryptoBully @BitcoinBirch @TheCryptoDog @missnatoshi
723 2018-02-23 22:27:28 Would you pay $5,000,000 (5 usd per coin times 1,000,000 tokens for the arbitrage bot) for 1% profit per day? That 5m is peanuts compared to the gains the hedge funds can make with CND. We could see $5 in 2019 or 2020 if Crypto goes into the trillions.
724 2018-02-23 22:27:27 My worry with the Petro is simply that they don't seem to have the mind trust to pull off a competent offering. Venezuela is a crypto-savvy country with a strong crypto community, but Maduro doesn't seem to have assembled a visible, trustworthy team.
725 2018-02-23 22:27:22 read sum #WallStreet news bout #XBT and watch the market and market cycle 
imo no way
726 2018-02-23 22:27:10 The info they share is freely available online and in books. It has existed in the stock market for ages, before crypto trading existed. Even if they train 100,000 people, that's like a tiny percentage of actual traders & bots out there.
727 2018-02-23 22:26:53 Dutch taxes on crypto... all above 25.000 Euro >> you pay 1.2% tax.. #yougottolovethedutch
728 2018-02-23 22:26:42 Thankfully there are projects in the crypto space that focus on having a positive impact on this issue. @4newcoin is one of them

739 2018-02-23 22:25:29 Interestingly, @laurashin had 2 tax accountants on her podcast not that long ago who both attested to having more crypto filers from EACH of their respective firms in 2015 than the IRS claimed filed altogether.
740 2018-02-23 22:25:23 not talking about moral crusade just weirds me out to put that shit on your body xD
741 2018-02-23 22:25:23 Crypto and icos wey de eso debes hablar
742 2018-02-23 22:24:58 Right now this year crypto regs are crazy. Exchanges are the ones who ultimately decide when to list a coin, not the coin devs.
743 2018-02-23 22:24:52 These answers to his question why are hilarious. Waiting for someone to say cause its crypto, everything pumps at least once
744 2018-02-23 22:24:43 というかSFDがなんとかならないと上昇しないような？
745 2018-02-23 22:24:33 Great tie up..#ico #crypto
746 2018-02-23 22:24:30 I've just started trading in the last few months and have nothing but respect for those in the game years.  Listening to the community every day and learning from mistakes.  Hard work will pay off as it does in every part of life.
747 2018-02-23 22:24:26 I expect the same as lisk ...  list relaunched and we experienced a dip .. V will do the same before it picks up and runs
748 2018-02-23 22:24:18 More like Shitcoin cause I honestly fucking hate Bitcoin and Bitcoin miners can just all just fuck off while all the crypto currencies fucking finally die and and we can move on from these leeches that just further prove capitalism is fucking awful but digitally this time
749 2018-02-23 22:24:08 That is a quote from their own spokesperson regarding an audit.

759 2018-02-23 22:22:31 Justin, I just wonder, how much $TRX you own ? Is it true that its 30% ?

761 2018-02-23 22:22:19 おはようございます。今日は上昇してるけど日曜はどうなるかな？
762 2018-02-23 22:22:15 I say surely Elliot's Wave theory based on 5 rising and 3 correcting waves
763 2018-02-23 22:22:14 I would agree, but on your same chart the RSI in the overbought region was a roughly the same angle in OCT to NOV and we see what it did from there. Interesting observation.
764 2018-02-23 22:22:10 What’s this got to do with crypto ? #cryptocurrency
765 2018-02-23 22:22:02 I just downloaded cnd to play with. Its fun. Wondering how much the payouts are for being right with your picks. Teeka thinks its a 5 dollar coin sometime in the near future

782 2018-02-23 22:19:57 There’s no “official” audit results yet though... wouldn’t the #crypto community come together and ask for it?
783 2018-02-23 22:19:56 You will prove them, that your are as strong as the Bitcoin is! We are not just a community, we are the great crypto-family, actually! Go for it, Andrea!

785 2018-02-23 22:19:40 Attack the dollar. Currently undermining it with promoting crypto currency.
786 2018-02-23 22:19:37 I think a lot of people are taking profit on the massive uptrend it had. That locks in profits that are guaranteed. No one really knows what $BTCP price will be but we do know the price of $ZCL is going to go down by 90%. I no longer believe it will even be competitive with $BCH
787 2018-02-23 22:19:26 This is very cool. Keep up the awesome efforts

792 2018-02-23 22:18:53 This is mainly true in a bull market. But were still in bear territory, the rules are different here.

813 2018-02-23 22:16:25 I never claimed to be a good referee. Crypto wallets in my simple mind comes with a slider that moves between convenience and security at each end. Ultimately the user decides what they consider the perfect balance for them. Many varieties, and peace to all.

820 2018-02-23 22:15:34 2017 crypto to crypto trades can be treated as 1031 like kind exchanges, which results in no taxable events, but the trades still need to be reported. Ernst & Young is preparing my 2017 taxes and they are claiming 1031 like kind exchanges for all of my crypto to crypto trades.

822 2018-02-23 22:15:32 Huh. I didn't realize that was committed.  I've heard anecdotally it's still real hard to use - hashes and crypto and the like are common in a lot of processes.  Good to know though.

847 2018-02-23 22:13:10 People thought the same of Uber/lyft and Airbnb. What an innocent idea back then... Crypto IS a disruptor. You’re only seeing the initial use cases, this will breed more and banks will get rekt. AML laws are rapidly getting rewritten as we speak.
848 2018-02-23 22:12:50 Sounds like people I knew that were in crypto in December vs the people in it next month LOL
849 2018-02-23 22:12:49 Not only it's a shitcoin, but it is a blatant and corrupt  shitcoin.

855 2018-02-23 22:12:05 Many reasons to stay anonymous IMHO. Tax authorities desperate for an "example", all your neighbours wanting crypto advice, your clients compromised, unwanted hacker/criminal attention, gold diggers that suddenly really like you as a person etc

864 2018-02-23 22:11:20 You’re right! Christina is very impressive can’t believe I missed her. Will prepare a curated list - I’m sure many want access to more great female speakers in the crypto scene.
865 2018-02-23 22:11:20 I think it’s very good for crypto that the first countries to launch their own digital currencies have a history of dangerous inflation. 

The citizens of these countries will be notably skeptical and see more value in decentralization

888 2018-02-23 22:09:47 I've read the white paper, the same one that is also controversial, 10 year investment for a coin expected to only go to 1 dollar isn't really a good investment in the crypto world either.  Either way, I have 1k coins which costs nothing really, that's my max for tron for now.
889 2018-02-23 22:09:33 Lololol no that's only if CNN buys it
890 2018-02-23 22:09:29 About bitcoins and crypto currency. The disadvantages surrounding bitcoins and how beneficial it can be at the same time. He did a research on bitcoin while he was in the university.
891 2018-02-23 22:09:29 大衆が「これからや！」って思ったタイミングで上昇トレンドは終わるし、逆に「終わった…」ってなった時に底を刻む。

相場、深いなあ…

894 2018-02-23 22:09:13 That's, ahh, the joke exactly. :-) drawing parallels to the crypto backdoor debate.
895 2018-02-23 22:09:03 Still on vacation.  Loving it, but missing my twitch streams and crypto trading.

898 2018-02-23 22:08:53 HYIPの利用では，多くのHYIPに少額を分散して投資し，総額が多くなるようにすることが基本ですね。出来心でつい特定のところに多く預けると，痛い目にあいます。HYIPは明日飛ぶかもと考えて慎重に。
899 2018-02-23 22:08:52 No problem Earthling! 
900 2018-02-23 22:08:23 That's what happens when you boast about your crypto profile.
901 2018-02-23 22:08:10 lol I have to ..otherwise my notification keeps going off. Not like I want to but I cannot help but comment on the utter blindness and stupidity. I will stop now, best of luck with your buys. But scam coins like Bar or Tbar gives crypto a bad name.
902 2018-02-23 22:08:07 BTCZ is opening it’s on way in the crypto world slowly but solidly. It will be a huge surprise for all the crypto world. No rush but with a lot of strength!
903 2018-02-23 22:07:55 I have an idea for a video... liquid nitrogen crypto mining @LinusTech
904 2018-02-23 22:07:53 Statistics show that most of the hackers are on Facebook/messenger this is the 3rd time I see someone using facebook messenger and this happened. 

I am actually sad that @PhilakoneCrypto got hacked!
905 2018-02-23 22:07:52 Me: [at a crypto currency convention] sell your poptropica coin the market is about to burst

Panelist: thats simply not

Me: WE ARE LIVING IN A POST SUPER POWER ISLAND BUBBLE THAT CANNOT LAST

Panelist: YOU ARE COMPLETELY OVERLOOKING THE STABILITY CREATED BY SHARK TOOTH ISLAND
906 2018-02-23 22:07:50 They're longer in this game and do more marketing. Nothing else
907 2018-02-23 22:07:44 I can see zero negatives with more people coming in to the crypto space. #dumbfounded 
908 2018-02-23 22:07:43 YOU'RE WELCOME EARTHLING 
909 2018-02-23 22:07:35 Correct, it's just not an additional carry to the system, as each unit of crypto, by definition replaces a unit of fiat.  Not exact, but definitely not a net addition.
910 2018-02-23 22:07:32 #Tezos ICO occurred when $btc was $2k. I would expect $XTZ absolute floor to be 5x ICO price at least.
911 2018-02-23 22:07:18 I just have 1 year and 9 months on crypto, and I saw that.
It was really fun to talk about crypto on my beginning and few people around me cared about price, now everyone just wanna know about price, when is a good entry and when moon.
I remember trading was just like a hobby.
912 2018-02-23 22:07:09 今日も大阪オフ会、明日も大阪オフ会ですわ
913 2018-02-23 22:07:08 Aaaaaand it's the end of another profitable trading week (those of you trading crypto have the weekends too), though I didn't make as many positions as I should've.

It's that time when I ask myself what I want to do during the weekend. I already have three things in mind....
914 2018-02-23 22:07:05 I work in a major bank and I can say that 99% of the people in there never even took two seconds to try to understand blockchain and crypto currencies. Once this gets too big to ignore, they'll have a lot of catching up to do.
915 2018-02-23 22:07:00 Just got all caught up on Mr Robot during the huge crypto crash, was good to get away from crypto for awhile, or not, fuckin' e-coin.
916 2018-02-23 22:06:59 Cheers Earthling! 
917 2018-02-23 22:06:49 He mentioned once about one dollar thing, we should do that. We should donate at least one dollar to him if you have enjoyed the benefits from his free TA and tutorials
918 2018-02-23 22:06:46 Could form an even bigger inverted h and s. It gives me solace.

955 2018-02-23 22:02:48 Also regulation so far seems to be open to letting crypto grow. Funnily enough the Dutch min. of Fin. said (along with some dumb stuff) 'you can't ban some things, even if you'd like to'. Derivatives might be another matter.
956 2018-02-23 22:02:38 I figured out 3 months ago dude you are late
957 2018-02-23 22:02:36 My prayers are with you @Socal_crypto. No amount of crypto/money can bring back someone you lose. Never forget what and who is really important in life.

961 2018-02-23 22:02:18 whats the crypto etiquette in leaving large sell orders on the books for weeks?
962 2018-02-23 22:02:12 I've seen several charts that point to a near term bearish trend for $BTC based on breaking support levels.  This certainly seems reasonable. However, I don't see anyone talking about how when $ comes out of Alts it goes to $BTC and what effect that will have... #crypto #altcoins
963 2018-02-23 22:02:10 #Crypto will surely create some competition for banks, that will hopefully benefit retail customers, but to think that it will kill banks?
That's just a little bit too extreme and too ambitious imho.
964 2018-02-23 22:02:10 
965 2018-02-23 22:02:09 Not sure I understand your question... Let me ask you what's the basis of our dollars? No longer gold, silver or anything other than trust?,... Same as crypto currencies (& they are not government fiat yet.)

967 2018-02-23 22:02:04 I see it too looks close!
968 2018-02-23 22:01:56 The fair comparison is to add up the electricity use of the processing banks, visa/MC, Amex, statement printing etc.  Thinking of this will make you forget abt crypto energy use.

970 2018-02-23 22:01:07 Nice!!
971 2018-02-23 22:01:04 Personally I'm in process of cashing out into Crypto which is not immune but if cautious believe it will emerge as a new global currency. A total economic crash would hasten the adoption. Only hold enough to get by on in banks.
972 2018-02-23 22:00:58 I just started staking with $IC and it has been a breeze. Super low supply coin that just got listed on topia
973 2018-02-23 22:00:56 No idea. BTC spiked down to 9578 for some reason. Huge dump that was instantly snapped up..? Literally no clue.
974 2018-02-23 22:00:54 I like your material but you usually focus a little too much on gambling coins. You might be surprised but not everybody gamble

976 2018-02-23 22:00:46 2 billion raised so far this year in crypto ICO's.

1014 2018-02-23 21:58:04 Helps with #BTC efficiency, but doesn’t completely fix the coin. Bitcoin is an inefficient coin as it is, all of these ‘features’ such as the lightning network are just prolonging the inevitable.

1037 2018-02-23 21:56:13 I can't complain about the fact that I just bought coffee flavored kombucha instead of cold brew coffee by accident without sounding like a complete Millennial Bay Area tool.

1038 2018-02-23 21:55:59 Why don't you? You're the one claiming it is not possible. Show me how it is MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE that any asset has a limit on its future value based on its current market cap and supply.
1039 2018-02-23 21:55:47 Nice information
1040 2018-02-23 21:55:40 $INS
Several large exchange listings. Near ICO prices currently. Great white paper and road map. No crypto competition in this space. Very large brands interested in their product

1045 2018-02-23 21:55:17 LTC is the fastest, lowest fee coin with liquidity. That is the go-to payment method for anyone who uses crypto as currency. That is for now. Something like XRB or XLM will be better in future.

1054 2018-02-23 21:54:21 yall get excited about flippening, cashening and all that crap, but how many did ask themselves this question: what is really needed to replace BTC on the throne and is any other crypto bringing it to the table?

"If a man receives a fish, he'll eat for a day. If a man learns how to fish, he'll eat for a lifetime."
1095 2018-02-23 21:50:21 Talking about that, since you started on crypto, what things changed radically on crypto community through the years?
1096 2018-02-23 21:50:20 the earliest any kind of crypto regulation would happen is 2019 and most likely that is even too early. stuff has to debated and researched. outside of shutting down exchanges governments can't really stop crypto.

1120 2018-02-23 21:47:30 Awesome RT @AriDavidPaul: The single biggest crypto innovation of 2018 will be working oracles.  Oracles (the ability to bring info from outside a blockchain into a blockchain) are critical to a great many projects.  Oracles exponentially increase the scope of what crypto can do.

1128 2018-02-23 21:46:31 I believe that's kinda the end plan of the crypto MM's in the end, syphon all the shitcoins to pump bitcoin in one giant supernova worth 100x World GDP. By that time we'll have only one religion left on earth : satoshism.

1130 2018-02-23 21:46:20 I agree that puts perspective on most crypto projects ,  ridiculously overvalued in the real world but as long as people are willing to pay for the tokens those valuations will hold.
1131 2018-02-23 21:46:04 heh, x200 :) I missed that hype :) don't think that last year growth will be repeated in crypto ever.

1165 2018-02-23 21:41:46 Maybe because so many crypto OGs have been shit talking him the last couple of days.. and in doing so basically giving free promotion of his account to hundreds of thousands of their followers? I think he's a great guy

During the rebrand the entire order book was cleared. Which is why there is so much anticipation for ven. Plus more news is likely but we don’t know.
1178 2018-02-23 21:40:11 I take a very small deposit by email money transfer, bitcoin or litecoin. If they want to pay by crypto, I'll send them a barcode and let them know where the closest bitcoin ATM is. After I recieve the deposit, I place the appointment in my calendar.

1188 2018-02-23 21:38:55 And the fact Telegram is launching a token in the first place is for me nothing more than a shameless attempt to take advantage of the gullible proportion of crypto enthusiasts who believe anything labelled an ICO and shilled by someone with a certain

1192 2018-02-23 21:38:08 Friendly Reminder to all the people trading crypto DO NOT USE FACEBOOK MESSENGER! That is where hackers get most of their leads.
1193 2018-02-23 21:38:01 99% of investors in crypto, do so to time exits and make quick $. The #iota community is the most tight knit of them all, aiming for adoption, partners and new tech to lead a smarter world. IOTA, the paypal of the crypto bubble?

1201 2018-02-23 21:36:33 @foamspace finally something that makes sense in crypto world. And you are using Ethereum instead of coming up with another useless copycat chain, even that puts you ahead of 99% of the projects.

1204 2018-02-23 21:36:11 Glad to say that I'm on the RIGHT side of the trend. 5 weeks into crypto, yet SOOOO much more to learn 
1205 2018-02-23 21:36:05 You don't have any currency. Neither do I. You can't buy any crypto-currency. Neither can I. You don't need to know what blockchain is any more than you need to know how hedge funds work. Exactly the same as me.
1206 2018-02-23 21:35:58 We remember when it was $9 . Anything above $3 is still profit .

1208 2018-02-23 21:35:55 Zenit St. Petersburg are literally funded by Russia's oil and Gas reserves. PSG owned by Qatar. An alternative way must be found to compete with this and I'll put my neck on the line and say Crypto Currency is probably Scottish football's best bet at this point.

1251 2018-02-23 21:32:14 I woke up at 2am because of a bad dream.
It was about crypto, where value was rising and I sold all of mine before it
1252 2018-02-23 21:32:13 In fact @jamie247 inspired me to think more long-term about crypto, and think beyond trading and how, in time, I might be able to create value and participate in this new wave that's gaining momentum. I'm just happy to be involved :D #web3 #crypto #BTC
1253 2018-02-23 21:31:41 SmartTaylorApp: RT RedPhillyEd: SmartTaylorApp Brilliant experience for me, lots of instruction all the way and the sale itself like clockwork. Really looking forward to this going live!

1282 2018-02-23 21:28:23 (2/2) of selling something and buying back back 30% cheaper is a huge hurdle most will never make. Swing trade with 25% of holdings and HODL the other 75%.

1301 2018-02-23 21:25:57 @aantonop Thank you for introducing me to Bitcoin and crypto in general. I just wanted to get your opinion on NANO, formerly known as Raiblocks. Do you see it as a game changer in comparison to bitcoin?
1302 2018-02-23 21:25:49 This is why you need to get rid of these naive privacy features and keep a list.  Ban people who disrespect the project.
This worked well for my grandfather in the steel era.
You crypto children have a lot to learn.
1303 2018-02-23 21:25:26 I know it's cause 99% of people are just trying to make quick money in cryptos and XRP seems to be what most think will do it, but it's the least interesting major crypto out there cause it just wants to make it easier for banks. I'm sure they won't lower their fees to us either

1315 2018-02-23 21:23:48 In crypto it’s a winning strategy with the volatility. Set an allocation for a coin, average into a deep position even assuming a 50-70% retrace. Swings of 40% in a day aren’t uncommon right now.

1323 2018-02-23 21:23:29 2/to make huge amounts of money. I feel like getting away from the current credit system asap should be our goal in crypto. I'm not saying credit is bad. I'm saying that we need a credit system where the funds you are borrowing actually exist somewhere.
1324 2018-02-23 21:23:24 Yeah but then over the last few days we all talking about Choe and Philakone and I just dont believe you can rack up that many crypto followers that quick and they both pass with flying colors.

1333 2018-02-23 21:22:57 Thanks, I appreciate it

1335 2018-02-23 21:22:48 Hay un módulo en Node que se llama crypto y he llamado a la variable que lo almacena encrypto porque me ha hecho gracia decir en voz alta encrypto con crypto já.
1336 2018-02-23 21:22:42 If you buy wit crypto what kinda taxes are tied to it?
1337 2018-02-23 21:22:33 Godspeed brother.
1338 2018-02-23 21:22:30 Yet another boring moon comment. Maybe it will give profit in 1-2 years. Accept or move on to a crypto you think will go up in a tempo that suits your temper
1339 2018-02-23 21:22:27 Yes, it’s important - not just about crypto - also read about blockchain democracy 
1340 2018-02-23 21:22:23 For me, the aspect of cryptocurrencies that offers the most value is the fact that my crypto can never be taken away, stolen or confiscated by anyone. I am the only person in the known universe who can access my wallets. Which other assets can you say that about?

1344 2018-02-23 21:22:12 wow...maybe folks should claim to be crypto enthusiasts who don't own coin. Better to tell a white lie and avoid getting mugged...
1345 2018-02-23 21:22:10 100% agree. It would never be allowed
1346 2018-02-23 21:22:05 I also made this twitter handle solely for crypto. Wanted to learn how to navigate the mine field so I did some digging and ran across @CryptoChoe profile in like 45 mins.
1347 2018-02-23 21:21:58 Ask the troops saving by Forward Air Contollers, jet jockeys and USAF ground combat controllers saved in Vietnam by air strikes.  I was USAF and I rode with US Army in Vietnam converting comms to crypto and inspecting airstrips for troop insertions.  Show us your Creds.
1348 2018-02-23 21:21:56 It's true. Not to mention worsen the problems in Venezuela
1349 2018-02-23 21:21:55 Good luck dude 
1350 2018-02-23 21:21:51 @graceobong do you think ICOs are bad for the crypto space?

1370 2018-02-23 21:19:14 #cryptofiat isn’t ideal as we often distinguish exchanges in terms of being “crypto-crypto” (eg. @ShapeShift_io, @etherdelta) vs. “crypto-fiat” (eg. @bisq_network, @hodlhodl).

“National cryptocurrencies” would be accurate but verbose.

Perhaps #statecoins could stick.

1373 2018-02-23 21:18:52 As the man said. Ripple XRP is their own thing whether you love it or hate it. Bcash is an overhyped ripoff.....but I would buy bcash if it was gonna make me money - I’m not on a moral crusade. The principles can wait until I have $10m banked.

1. Similar strategy will be deployed that they did w/Sequoia, KKR & Alt GP's 10yrs ago; they will invest, you will provide co-invest (after being pushed) and if you're not careful, they will start doing directs in 3-5 yrs from now
1376 2018-02-23 21:18:17 Looking forward to the future of $drgn. Interesting events coming up in the roadmap such as the server less platform and PoW implementation.

1479 2018-02-23 21:10:14 We certainly can, it’s neither here nor there. I am honestly just curious where a perception of INsincerity (if not nefariousness) comes from.

As for crypto fanatics - the Zealots can be ‘sincere’ but doesn’t mean they are right or healthy.  Arguing one doesn’t make the other

1492 2018-02-23 21:08:48 @crypto_tab how is it 40-50 h/s with an i5 gen8 laptop? good or bad?
1493 2018-02-23 21:08:45 Of course, anything can happen in crypto. But following this chart is far more risky

1495 2018-02-23 21:08:41 Did this require crypto currency or was the sponsorship paid for in potatoes

1503 2018-02-23 21:08:03 Its crypto, its twitter, we like trolling and joking. You are so serious man..
Go fun yourself !
1504 2018-02-23 21:07:43 But yeah... Kurt is a twat. D&C doesn't really comeoff as "Crypto Right" but that's just me. Not sayin' you have to watch him, if ya don't that's cool then.
1505 2018-02-23 21:07:40 Now that’s how you hire in 2018 in a crypto space
1506 2018-02-23 21:07:19 I have no idea what "damage" you took, but I do know that talented as you are you'll break-even in 1 month if you put your will to it.
1507 2018-02-23 21:07:16 Best of luck!

1512 2018-02-23 21:06:47 Its Bullsh*t! The banks wont allow us to use our own money to buy whatever we want?!? Maybe its because they are scared that crypto will take over the financial institution?? less money in the bank for the banks to invest from our dollar?? Maybe everyone should just switch to RBC

1520 2018-02-23 21:06:09 Why is that. Just when I think I got a grasp on the psychology of crypto shit gets crazy. Ahhh but that’s why I love crypto.

1523 2018-02-23 21:05:45 @Cryptos_Aus you should host a segment on (EOS cafe) @ibuildfreedom. Get an Aussie perspective on the crypto space here. They have a discord channel setup and looking for hosts!
1524 2018-02-23 21:05:43 @hashflare You guys are a joke .. It doesn't take month to make a new version for batch payements... Also the crypto madness from decembre is over and you could very easily decrease the minimum with no problem ... A joke , really
1525 2018-02-23 21:05:38 i do believe that most starting traders in crypto lose money, but more then 1 % take profit

1531 2018-02-23 21:05:13 so I looked up the date of the G20 summit...November 30, 2018...that's 9 months away. who in their right mind would be worried about that. also, regulation has been good for crypto in both south korea and Japan.
1532 2018-02-23 21:05:09 Try that with crypto
1533 2018-02-23 21:04:56 Than why dont you show up math!

1540 2018-02-23 21:04:36 The best suggestion would be to buy more on @StocksExchangeR now, and then do a dollar cost average. if they were a scam, they would have already scammed out. Read the roadmap people, it's ontrack from what was offered at ICO
1541 2018-02-23 21:04:17 You don’t Hodl every shit coin and just expect to win in the long term. Pick your projects. Trade the the shit.

1586 2018-02-23 21:01:06 Pray for a strong double bottom and it could be a start. Or at least a cool bounce
1587 2018-02-23 21:01:05 Yes please hold, don't sell at a loss, unfortunantly the price has gone because of people being impatient.  If people looked at the ICO roadmap, they would have seen it was a long roadmap, not a short term money maker. I just bought up last night on @StocksExchangeR
1588 2018-02-23 21:01:01 Best years

1634 2018-02-23 20:57:49 Agreed.  Original people have either almost all gone cuckoo in their own ways only to be swapped out for cocky, immature children who know nothing about life yet posing as TA experts. It’s a romper room. Not a good look for Crypto.

1637 2018-02-23 20:57:23 The most interesting project for today! Very attracted the attention of someone else! I'm part of it! And advise everyone! Very interesting and creative project! #AKAIITO #ICO #ethereum #blockchain #token #AIC #Cryptocurrency #Tokenization #crypto
1638 2018-02-23 20:57:22 Where can I see a list of places accepting it or going to accept it for taxes?
1639 2018-02-23 20:57:22 Sorry.. but I haven't got any answer yet..
1640 2018-02-23 20:57:14 Don’t tell me you eat soy. All I care about is BIIIITTREEEEEEX!!!
1641 2018-02-23 20:57:13 Traders and crypto don’t work !!  #btc #eth #ripple  anly work HOLD BROTHERS !!

1643 2018-02-23 20:57:07 Played black jack myself. It’s a money management and math game, did well. Nothing like the crypto space though, it makes everything else seem boring.

1645 2018-02-23 20:57:02 Well they can say if they applied at least.
1646 2018-02-23 20:56:44 Sorry to hear man 
1647 2018-02-23 20:56:40 Even if ripple does somehow happen to end up being the best technology, history has shown good enough technology can still win. Anyway, good luck with your crypto investments.
1648 2018-02-23 20:56:26 It's a good time to buy @DeepOnionx. It will be a big surprise on the crypto market, very soon!
1649 2018-02-23 20:56:13 Maybe that's why the whales are all interested?  
1650 2018-02-23 20:56:07 Can’t wait! Was thrilled to hear Rodeo Goat is coming to HTX... the suspense is killing me!
1651 2018-02-23 20:56:02 these guys are good for holding the Crypto n00bs hands and changing their diapers for them...others do it themselves and don't need to advertise it on twitter, that said i do appreciate their info, even if i don't "follow along"
1652 2018-02-23 20:55:56 two days...i need 2 months to discuss my crypto issues!!!
1653 2018-02-23 20:55:50 isn't he like a crypto Islamist

1655 2018-02-23 20:55:30 Sometimes you've got to realise how lucky you are. No idea what I'd be doing without $crypto. Maybe having a bit more of a social life?
1656 2018-02-23 20:55:19 sorely needed to advance crypto payments
1657 2018-02-23 20:55:10 Great interview. Noticed you were real careful to not be transparent about the unregulated crypto space. Got the feeling you think us reg Joe's shouldn't be allowed to invest in venture capital. Much love for you though Tone.
1658 2018-02-23 20:55:07 Thanks for the follow hard work but will keep trying to get this number down thanks 
1659 2018-02-23 20:54:58 I to only joined twitter to keep up with Crypto and follow @CryptoChoe & @PhilakoneCrypto coz they break it down easy for us new comers to understand
1660 2018-02-23 20:54:57 Looks slick! Really nice to have you working in the Stellar / crypto space.

1662 2018-02-23 20:54:49 When in doubt, I refer to sub-wave counts and look for confluence with known patterns. I like the right hand picture because I can spot the 5/3/5/3 pattern that has already developed.  The pic on the left, wave 4 looks incorrect to me.

1673 2018-02-23 20:53:29 If only blockchain wouldn't just be associated with crypto by a large section of people.
Or that if every blockchain startup wouldn't in some way be associated with crypto trying to make an easy buck.
*sigh*
Blockchain is great tech, crypto is a bubble. There a difference.
1674 2018-02-23 20:53:24 Women’s panties when you show them your crypto portfolio?

1677 2018-02-23 20:53:06 Fair enough. I just have a laptop that works for what I need it to do for work and use my PS4 because all of my friends are PSN anyway. I want a nice PC once the crypto boom dies down and my car is paid off a bit more though 
1678 2018-02-23 20:53:01 Atta girl, very cool  Are you going to pitch your crypto platform? Cuz that is a moneymaking machine in the waiting

1687 2018-02-23 20:51:56 Adoption of that would be great and @nanocurrency is FREE AND INSTANT not just "fast and cheap".  Great for microtransactions and superchats IMHO.
1688 2018-02-23 20:51:49 Here's hoping for love and gratitude these days for you and your family.  Take care
1689 2018-02-23 20:51:48 I started trading crypto for about a month and lost money because I lacked TA skills. I recently joined Twitter to get free TA tips. Don't get jealous and be so desperate to leverage of @CryptoChoe skill and fame. #jealous #desperate

1694 2018-02-23 20:51:14 This has always been and always will be. Crypto or otherwise. No one pays for the bitter truth.
1695 2018-02-23 20:51:14 If you believe in the vision of a coin in #cryptocurrency, then stick to your guns & ignore all the FUD that may came with it. The hate of a coin will come with the territory, but don't let that deter you from a project you personally love. Keep calm & #hodl it close. #crypto

1698 2018-02-23 20:50:46 Neither do you. It is improbable, not impossible. Anything can be assigned any value. But it only becomes valuable when a critical mass of people agrees on said value.
1699 2018-02-23 20:50:42 You're right... I'll never question Crypto de' Medeci again.... :)

1702 2018-02-23 20:50:26 mdrrrr
1703 2018-02-23 20:50:15 #cardano #ada ADA might have lost some value as a coin because of the recent yard sale going on in the crypto space. But remember this, the intrinsic value of the platform will change the world as we know it. I’ll be proud to tell my grandkids i was there to witness it. Be strong
1704 2018-02-23 20:49:58 What's worse corruption or constant scams and fraud? If we can't do something about all the crypto scams and fraud then we're no better off.

1707 2018-02-23 20:49:23 By the time you still you will have learned more about #crypto and will be able to make your own purchasing decisions.

That's how you become elite.

It's hard work.

Not a gift.

Waiting for moves on #trx #xvg #xrp #appc and #xlm
1710 2018-02-23 20:48:52 Would love this so long as factual. You’ve said before the FUD is one of the biggest detriments to the technology - perhaps that’s why people are quick to get their backs up. Critical thinking is essential to good investing in the crypto landscape
1711 2018-02-23 20:48:36 It’s the only crypto currency where you have to physically mine it in VR 
1712 2018-02-23 20:48:31 yeah right... sarcasm.... lolz
1713 2018-02-23 20:48:26 Sorry to hear brother, all the best.

1715 2018-02-23 20:48:08 He also claimed binance was hacked lol
1716 2018-02-23 20:48:07 People making a fuss cause Coinbase CEO liked a tweet about @nanocurrency

1720 2018-02-23 20:47:59 I’m saying, as per the second half of my tweet, in the past 4 days Eric’s subscriber count has risen by 6%, yet this random page accusing him of some stratospheric growth has had their following increase by 16%. I don’t have a profile picture as this is my crypto account. 1/2
1721 2018-02-23 20:47:58 Prayers for you and your family.
1722 2018-02-23 20:47:55 Makes no sense. Crypto is viewed as investments by government. Would only have to claim what you actually profited from your investment during the year if it was pulled out. This is like saying they would check your stock portfolio.
1723 2018-02-23 20:47:55 you may as well get out of your $zcl if you were just hoping for a spike cuz of the fork.....  it's over

1726 2018-02-23 20:47:41 Gotta love crypto twitter. This is the first thing I pictured after reading the tweet. Then looked at replies to see if anyone had memed it. Not disappointed.
1727 2018-02-23 20:47:40 Can’t have an argument unless I know what you think.

But then when people defend people who claim vets are crypto-Nazis, that already tells me a lot.
1728 2018-02-23 20:47:40 Well @assassin7898 spotted it first 
1729 2018-02-23 20:47:22 Why? Because they are both black and white? The linking O’s and C’s aren’t similar at all.

When was the last time you saw people under 25 into investing? Nuff said..
1734 2018-02-23 20:46:36 I don't know what Nano is. More interested in bitcoin being fast, since it's the #1 crypto that everyone and their mom knows about from the news. And the biggest decentralized network.

1748 2018-02-23 20:45:26 If you wonder why BitcoinIRA is advertising everywhere...there are a handful of firms that can handle crypto IRAs so they can charge 15% off the top just to get in--plus other fees. Highlights regulation is all about creating cartels under the pretext of protecting the consumer.

1756 2018-02-23 20:44:34 Anyone: "Ripple is..."
Jon[XRP]: FUD!

Anyone: "Trx is..."

If the word "FUD" didn't exist, crypto twitter would not exist as we know it
1757 2018-02-23 20:44:29 
1758 2018-02-23 20:44:27 Ага, особенно, когда носители украинской мовы с Запада прятались от призыва по Польшам и Румыниям, и едут працюваты в Москву и Калининград, а русскоязычные с Киева и Востока сражаются на Донбассе за этих супер-украинцев, которые их записали в недо-украинцы.
1759 2018-02-23 20:44:17 Hell yeah, I don't know about everyone on here but my brokerage account is performing nearly as well as crypto.  Catalyst trades are just HR after HR.  I expect to break a million in assets this year if I'm lucky.  Plus add 100k-250kUSD to savings. We will see

1763 2018-02-23 20:43:01 I believe they’re trying to push us all into crypto (their crypto). This will give them full spectrum dominance. It’s not about dollars or euros, it’s about one world currency..:
1764 2018-02-23 20:42:50 Slow and steady all the way got me to 60k minus 59,940k. Check it out and see does the maths add up
1765 2018-02-23 20:42:47 Nothing in this crypto market makes sense anymore.
1766 2018-02-23 20:42:46

1769 2018-02-23 20:42:38 I’ll be in bed then 11pm UK...... as we are talking Tron, I guess the Mainnet launching early will be a talking point. This will also help OCN to find some movement, can I get it on catch up?

1783 2018-02-23 20:40:56 Great to be back from vacation but I think we need the hype and fomo back again in crypto from last year to make new highs.. and all news is already showing good reasons for it.. You just became all scared? Put away your money in so called old safe stock markets? Don't be crazy
1784 2018-02-23 20:40:41 Great decision on giving a heads-up chance for your loyal telegram members. I suggest everyone do #KYC as early as possible to avoid any issues. Thanks to solid project, roadmap and dev team, the entire crypto space has eyes on this awesome @effectaix #ICO.
1785 2018-02-23 20:40:39 John Mcafee is one person in crypto that is NOT a trusted source. AltcoinBuzz loses credibility with this.
1786 2018-02-23 20:40:32 @coinbase any plans to add new crypto currencies soon? $xvg and $dgb would be awesome. @DigiByteCoin @vergecurrency

1788 2018-02-23 20:40:09 This is the first time I've been #FF'd by someone that doesn't follow me. lol. Cheers, regardless. 
1789 2018-02-23 20:40:04 I love Vertcoin but can't deny that the fans have formed into a cult. Also, the NANO cult has to be one of the most cancerous in crypto.
1790 2018-02-23 20:39:56 #crypto projects having job listings that require a degree and 10 yrs of experience makes me sad. We shouldn't be like that!

1803 2018-02-23 20:38:25 It’s getting a bit frustrating wading through so many schemes and scams in #crypto masternodes, and crypto in general
1804 2018-02-23 20:38:10 License ? What nonsense
1805 2018-02-23 20:38:10 Can you people stop flooding @BittrexExchange about the $ZCL fork... my god. If you are that braindead that you don't think they have looked into it and have already made up their mind on whether they will support it or not, you should just quit crypto.

1912 2018-02-23 20:28:08 You need to find your way to success in the crypto market: 
1- Invest and hold (Fundamental Analysis)
2- Trade in the market (much harder and needs time and experience) needs TA & FA: 
    -> Intraday
    -> Trade the swings (Personnally more comfortable with this).

1944 2018-02-23 20:24:20 BTC is controlled and maintained by statists.

Lightning Network is a Trojan Horse designed to trick new users into using a controlled system.

1945 2018-02-23 20:24:13 TLDR getting crypto right is f-ing hard, breaking it is much easier. I wouldn't use a crypto scheme I designed, even though I have some experience with writing them. I would always use something made by professionals and cross validated by others.

1954 2018-02-23 20:23:11 NEVER Send away Crypto to anyone telling you they send you more back. 

If this acc really belongs to tron foundation, it has been hacked.
1955 2018-02-23 20:22:49 @Haejin_Crypto  You have been a bit quiet today. Don't let those guys get to you. I suggest you go on your own and open your personal site up. You have enough followers to succeed. Still recommend to do some posts though to grow more followers for your training courses.
1956 2018-02-23 20:22:47 Third-party Guarantor

Local lenders may select from a list of local loans with varying incentives to act as guarantor. Once committed, any left over unpaid delinquency or default of loans under their protection will be paid for by this guarantor.

1957 2018-02-23 20:22:45 This is not new to crypto. Most rich ppl have earned their money through capitalism, then decide at the end of the day that what ppl need is socialism, with the super rich at the helm of the super-state like monarchs or dictators -  because they are sooooo virtuous.

1960 2018-02-23 20:21:56 I never believed there was NO danger. There’s no such thing as 100% secure. We opt to balance security vs usability. Most people lose crypto due to loss of keys due to poor usability of the tools. 1/
1961 2018-02-23 20:21:54 Yeah things are finally coming together.
1962 2018-02-23 20:21:43 But when it’s clearly not organic wouldn’t it be better to just ignore them?

2077 2018-02-23 20:09:47 @AltOne_Crypto any midday btc update buddy?
2078 2018-02-23 20:09:40 What makes this Monero so attractive?
2079 2018-02-23 20:09:35 It does a good job translating crypto enlightenment to those who aren’t yet so deep down the hole 
2080 2018-02-23 20:09:29 You mean 55 percent?

2084 2018-02-23 20:09:07 "Corruption" is a ubiquitous word. Ir proliferates through all sectors of human society... not just governmental entities. Much of the humanity that "lives under very corrupt govt's" is corrupt itself.

2087 2018-02-23 20:09:02 the crypto space is two groups

1. tech enthusiasts
2.. market speculating crypto bros

#1 is not trading and is working hard fulfilling the promise of cryptocurrency

#2 plays silly low information games like "the price drop in bitcoin is scary, sell all cryptocurrency!"

2103 2018-02-23 20:07:25 Same question here, I could agree with LTC rising and I share the same view of BTC’s price but Tron is a pure example of mid-December’s crisis of shilling useless coins, which have good marketing only.
2104 2018-02-23 20:07:13 Large tranche soon from what I’ve heard
2105 2018-02-23 20:07:12 I've collected things all my life - games, comic books, trading cards, coins, toys and more.  $Crypto is filling the same desire that fueled my earlier collections.

2106 2018-02-23 20:07:10 Indeed. Too many wimps in crypto crying at a bearish chart. They should go play Pokemon Go.

2108 2018-02-23 20:07:06 Although many are trying to avoid paying taxes of their profit gained from crypto, tho the root to this could be the unfairness from the government and the society... I guess human just sucks not even crypto can save humanity

2110 2018-02-23 20:06:47 It looks we are heading to 168. The target you suggested yesterday
2111 2018-02-23 20:06:46 Does that mean MM's pump the price up and then shakeout people again? So dump, pump, dump?
2112 2018-02-23 20:06:39 $DPW like most crypto this cannot hold onto its gains
2113 2018-02-23 20:06:33 What’s your view on elective abortions since your into hyperbolic accusations?

2115 2018-02-23 20:06:18 Why I am Bullish Overall

Again the contrarian, they are catching up with the trend but let me tell you something...

I am BULLISH!

Why?

Because even if/when btc drops to 6k — what happens then?  Did people stop believing in bitcoin?

If the company behind the P2P platform defaults 
or declares bankruptcy, the lender has limited 
recourse with respect to the borrower.

2142 2018-02-23 20:03:28 The text is alluding to crypto being fraudulent and a blackbox. Both you can find in the financial industry which is much older than the cryptoworld and hence bigger. Crypto enables decentralized (blockchain) applications, let's see where we are in 10 years.

2162 2018-02-23 20:00:56 I live out in the country and I ask many ppl have u heard of Bitcoin? and only about 1 out of every 10ppl say yes, so I'm thinking of starting a local crypto club to physically help spread the knowledge.
2163 2018-02-23 20:00:55 honestly I think they messed up, I look at the forks and some were put in to solve problems with the servers not the blockchain itself. Servers were later upgraded to patch the bug themselves. now it could revert to a more realistic and classical representation of the vision.

2187 2018-02-23 19:59:25 The way I think of it $BCH is a hedge - it will most likely become worthless and unnecessary like a lot of #Altcoins BUT if there's a huge security flaw discovered in #SegWit that destroys $BTC then $BCH is like a net that saves us because it's a return to the old proven system.

2213 2018-02-23 19:56:59 at least you say it with a gif (obviously i fell addressed by your tweet - i am stil too shy for reasonable tweets and probably too new to crypto - but trying to do better pushed through your message :D)
2214 2018-02-23 19:56:56 RT @AriDavidPaul: The single biggest crypto innovation of 2018 will be working oracles.  Oracles (the ability to bring info from outside a blockchain into a blockchain) are critical to a great many projects.  Oracles exponentially increase the scope of what crypto can do.

2228 2018-02-23 19:56:33 Bravo Thomas. A lot of people new to crypto don’t understand market cap or price v market cap correlation. You’ve eloquently explained it in your video , well done

2233 2018-02-23 19:55:52 I happily unfollowed a handful of so called influencers last night! if being a bullying hater is what it takes to be an "OG" in the crypto game ill take a pass!
2234 2018-02-23 19:55:46 No worries. We are all 1 big crypto family 
2235 2018-02-23 19:55:34 Is there any real news Facebook is getting into crypto?
2236 2018-02-23 19:55:24 El — you’re a smart guy. I’m blunt when I speak. I’ve been messing with crypto for a while. I’m also in love with Blockchain, but I didn’t come on to twitter until December. There are people who have been doing this a longer than me on twitter and don’t have the following.
2237 2018-02-23 19:55:18 yall hear how much these bitcoin and other crypto currencys values are increasing daily???? any crypto boys willing to show a noob like me a thing or two about how to strike it big
2238 2018-02-23 19:55:16 Reasons I prefer #Crypto over #Stock: #Revolutionary, #Deflationary, #Decentralized, #Fractional#24/7, #No Day Trading Rules#No HFT
2239 2018-02-23 19:55:15 Just have to say as a noob I follow all 3 of them. They all have great charts give sound advice. Without them I would be lost in a sea of shitcoins. Thanks guys I really do appreciate. The cream rises to the TOP.
2240 2018-02-23 19:55:15 Marketplace Lending Still Has Problems But With Some Improvements
The new social technologies of the Internet have helped to expand the boundaries of the traditional banking system by offering novel credit alternatives, such as marketplace lending.

2241 2018-02-23 19:55:11 That's fine. To be honest I plan on holding max 7 positions, and they are each divided up between short/mid/long term. This will exclude neo, since I plan on accumulating some for ico's.
2242 2018-02-23 19:54:53 I'll look into like credit unions and different banks stance on this as i choose my next bank (Bye Bye @TD_Canada) - Im sure they are all not down with crypto, they are scared of its future competition. I earned my credit limit and dont want anyone telling me what I can buy.

in thr endefect nothing is a currency itselfe because there are just a spare number of shops that accept crypro. so these are no currencys in general. the next thing what is crypto it is mostly the part of the blockchain.

2269 2018-02-23 19:52:01 FB is only as valuable as it's network. Crypto allows networks to be owned by their users. FB is very afraid (banning crypto ads) and they should be. There will be a crypto-based competitor that returns the value of the network to those that create it. Then it's over for FB
2270 2018-02-23 19:51:53 We can all tell you are a BTC holder lol. Don't be upset that another crypto currency is instant, free, more economically friendly...and works. There is plenty of room for both BTC and Nano to grow.

2293 2018-02-23 19:48:56 Hey so my friend ( we are college students) just launched an app for Android that can mine crypto currency with your phone. Now your not going to make alot, but if you have some old Android phones you can have them mining rather than collecting dust.
2294 2018-02-23 19:48:53 We all realize that blockchain and crypto is going to be the foundational solution for fake news/transparency/information fraud, right? Right?
2295 2018-02-23 19:48:37 If were having crypto baby showers, include me lol. Baby girl coming Mar 9th!
2296 2018-02-23 19:48:36 Is that not within their rights as a business? Similar to major CC companies preventing the use of their credit to purchase crypto?Those who seek that particular service or disapprove of that action will simply stop transacting with those companies.
2297 2018-02-23 19:48:34 Dear @binance_2017,

Will you PLEASE fix the BS way you hold onto minimal decimals of coin values that NO-ONE can then sell. 

Hiding small values is not the answer. Let us sell the crap we don't want. 

Sincerely,
Everyone
2298 2018-02-23 19:48:25 never thought i'd be this bullish 
on crypto & investing in general
2299 2018-02-23 19:48:19 I'm thinking around 250 sats will be a good buy in point.
2300 2018-02-23 19:48:16 Look i dont have time to play so what i write i feel if you dont like it then thats ok and i dont need too hear that.   If you get smart ill block ya in one incident.

Be glad someone is not paid too lie about crypto currency playing all nicey nice.
2301 2018-02-23 19:48:13 If you do your research you will see that coins are burned as they are used until a certain cap is reached "Bruh"
2302 2018-02-23 19:48:12 Are you high ?
2303 2018-02-23 19:48:07 Me too.
Not sure when/how we get the big changes, but Bitcoin and Crypto are now part of the global lexicon. Bubbles will come and go, but beneath all the hype there is a steady gradual progression toward understanding, acceptance, and valuation.

2334 2018-02-23 19:44:12 That graph has been posted about $BTC and all of crypto on every single rise theyve had. Check those two little bumps at the beginning of your graph. Then zoom in. Then adjust for scale. This comparison was a meme before you most likely even knew about it/first saw it. #FUD
2335 2018-02-23 19:44:08 We ought celebrate any legitimate use case of crypto tech. If @nanocurrency can successfully exploit @Twitch that's a boon for us. If @reddcoin would get their tech together, they would have made a similar move earlier. First team to integrate tipping into @Twitter wins the race.

2348 2018-02-23 19:42:51 A great idea backed up by a great team!   @streamityorg   project focuses on establishment of a powerful crypto currency  exchange  which will include a broad range of services a from crypto  currency  markets development. #Streamity #StreamityICO #ICO
2349 2018-02-23 19:42:32 ですね（笑）
2350 2018-02-23 19:42:25 I completely agree... It's the work that matters in the end
2351 2018-02-23 19:42:25 No one if doubting on crypto going in trillion market cap. it was about if $XVG or $MINT can reach $1000 a coin, which is not possible in coming year

2357 2018-02-23 19:41:29 @crytpodale I think you should have a segment on your podcast where 2 people debate over whether or not they deserve to put charts up on twitter. I'd like to be the first to have this discussion with a crypto tool of my choice. Thoughts?

2360 2018-02-23 19:41:04 Why is it called “card” stack? Because we saw the limit to the  one-icon-per-app paradigm in a blockchain world, where many  decentralized and traditional apps interact.#Cardstack #ICO #Crypto
2361 2018-02-23 19:40:57 true. crypto market will be in the trillions... lots of trillions. every year more mainstream and institutional money. hodl safe coins.

2368 2018-02-23 19:40:20 My favorite part of the #crypto communtiy is that we’re known for spelling words wrong (#hodl) and making endless #memes about the market crashing or booming.  —- #Cryptocurrency
2369 2018-02-23 19:40:10 I’m pointing this out, because TNW refers to the source as “researcher” which should make their source to appear extremely credible in the crypto space. This while the source himself in all honesty admits, he is merely a script kiddy with poor programming skills.

2392 2018-02-23 19:37:44 Crypto has created a lot of wealthy people. Interesting to see how these billion-dollar companies look in 5 years.. are they tech giants with multiple partner companies or have regulations gotten the better of them?

2395 2018-02-23 19:37:13 And the reason why price gets rejected at every resistance level is b/c of Roger selling his stash to his subjects. 
2396 2018-02-23 19:37:04 Bu dengelemenin çok kısa sürede çok faydalı olacağına inanıyorum. Crypto dünyasında süreçler hızlı ilerlediği için ara pek uzun sürmez. Zira bu dönem de ben  BTC artırmak yerine dolar artırmaya odaklandım. Olası dip de yüksek girebilmek için..

I've been saying it all along: Dragon is the Enterprise blockchain game. I've worked with enterprise-types of companies in the Seattle area. It's quite incredible how they are knit all together. And they know money. $DRGN
2411 2018-02-23 19:35:52 Edge is a mobile wallet only. Desktop wallets are insecure, user errors with hardware wallets have led to missing funds, but we are unaware of a single crypto ever being lost due to a device attack (2FA via SMS is *not* a device attack).
2412 2018-02-23 19:35:33 Probably rejection at every resistance point and then slow bleed into irrelevance. A good way to gauge this is to watch how vocal and how many public appearances Roger and Craig start making.

The washing machine owner could set up debt card acceptance now. But quarters work for the owners.

Still I love the cool ideas that crypto is making.

2505 2018-02-23 19:24:34 This is not about debt (banks make

2528 2018-02-23 19:21:03 Something big is bubbling away after this next short crypto dip. March was always going to be the start of big things in crypto in 2018. Telcoin into top 50 in Q2 and Verge into top 15 in Q2. Big things going to happen for both.

2533 2018-02-23 19:19:59 Why don’t you do a “real” spreadsheet and point it out. Also, point out exactly what my mission here in crypto is. Being that I’ve stated multiple times that I am not day trading nor swing trading — when I buy my coins or tokens, obviously you want to buy at ICO pricing, but I
2534 2018-02-23 19:19:55 Sorry man . God heal her soul and comfort you all
2535 2018-02-23 19:19:34 I agree, but welcome to crypto 
2536 2018-02-23 19:19:26 1/To be fair I can see why buying crypto on credit would be a weird slippery slope for the banks to allow right now. Crypto is so volitile that you could max your card to buy in on a dip, and the next day your coin moonshots.
2537 2018-02-23 19:19:23 @crypto_oda Vous en pensez quoi alors de l'offre de placement de "Les bons Placements" ? Fiable ou pas ?
2538 2018-02-23 19:19:18 In crypto we don’t capitulate, never!   

We go down, but we become stronger 
We go up and we change the world 

The only capitulation will come from @WarrenBuffett when he will buy its first bitcoin. If not, it will be the first train he would miss in his life.

2545 2018-02-23 19:18:33 I legit laughed at this post, just goes to show the validity and potential value of crypto, the best part is how they’re crying foul but racing to secure patents on anything crypto related they know their days are numbered.

2548 2018-02-23 19:18:19 Thank you. Regardless of the status of the account, they hold my coins on my behalf, they dont own my coins. An allocation was rewarded for the ownship of the coin......... i am the owner!
2549 2018-02-23 19:18:15 Gartner Hype Cycle at play in a sector driven by trade. The crypto realm has essentially opened up the quasi-illusion of regular folks seeing VC type ROI with instant liquidity. Satoshi was a genius no doubt. He turned on a robot the world can not turn off.

How about ignoring the capacity exceeding BTC and ETH combined?

Ignoring the tokens coming in May with opcodes...

Your ability to predict the market to allow equitable access to the ico is a great precursor to how you would deal Asia's energy market.    Best crowdsale by far.  #crypto

2634 2018-02-23 19:08:53 not immediately but the more people get in and request coins the better the chances, also free to buy them so good way for people to get introduced to crypto trading!
2635 2018-02-23 19:08:53 bitcoin FXはロング(先に買い後で売る)で行う方が安全。多少高く買ってしまっても，待っていればもっと高く売れるのだから。逆に先に売ると，安く買い戻そうとしても相場がもうそのレベルに戻ってこない。大損する前に買い戻すこと。コインは減ったままだが，円での価値は取り戻せる。

2646 2018-02-23 19:06:57 @julianhosp Hi! Macht es bei hohen Investitionen Sinn, seine Coins auf verschiedene Hardware Wallets aufzuteilen oder könnte ich z.B. 100% meines Portfolios auf einem Ledger / Trezor sichern? Was hälst du für sinnvoll? Habe einen fünfstelligen Betrag in Crypto #cryptofit
2647 2018-02-23 19:06:55 We've been negotiating a project with our government and leaders, that could provide far more value to citizens than the existing cryptocurrencies.

Still decided on "Crypto Ruble" because it's "easier and faster to build", regardless of the fact that it offers nothing.

All prime and at solid prices and trending up somewhat still

2653 2018-02-23 19:06:16 I met this girl the other day. She said all crypto meetups are in Cypress Brewery. Cypress as in Cyprus, capital of fintech and finance. I found this fact amusing.

2679 2018-02-23 19:03:22 Not a solid HODL...Wake up, the whole market lives & dies with btc and pump/dumps. Until crypto is more than just a speculation market, this will continue. A little research goes a long way, once regulation/custody is taken care of, you’ll see how misinformed you are.
2680 2018-02-23 19:03:19 HOOKERS AND BLOW and CRYPTO for life.

2698 2018-02-23 19:01:14 you dont have the necessary skill to build an actual crypto #NurucoinIsAScam0
2699 2018-02-23 19:01:10 This is a dangerous thing to say, but I think the idea of crypto currency would be great if governments had a completely different currency than citizens. I am sure there is a lot of red tape there, but not being able to fund schools is ridiculous. Then they arm staff? Whut??
2700 2018-02-23 19:01:02 You can download Daedalus wallet and try it out. It's still not matured but it's a perfectly working digital currency. You can even change your wallet address to protect your privacy. A feature I haven't seen before. Cardano is also one of the most active project on github.

2756 2018-02-23 18:55:37 Yeah it's a shame the system is being abused in that way. People won't fall for that nonsense forever.

The system may be seriously overvalued at this point but only time will tell. 2018 will be big for crypto.

2765 2018-02-23 18:53:50 About time...
2766 2018-02-23 18:53:41 @crypto_mvp Hey Mo! Thanks for the Follow. What can you say about the Crypto?
2767 2018-02-23 18:53:31 As for the future, I do think there is a place for more than one crypto  (even if most are doomed). It's not winner take all here, but as you  pointed out, $btc is treated as gold by the market.
2768 2018-02-23 18:53:29 This guy @Landm_Marius is not only peddling a subscription service but also, if you do a Google search, you may conclude he’s a charlatan.  Praising him without taking that into account, IMHO, will hurt your own credibility.

2788 2018-02-23 18:52:09 Sorry if that sounds like I have no sense of humor, but some people are *seriously* getting screwed over in this space, and I think the thought-leaders in crypto need to be sensitive to that.
2789 2018-02-23 18:51:59 But muh butthurt!

2799 2018-02-23 18:50:56 If you are calling the #NRA a terrorist organization, I think you need to take a long walk and think about your profoundly disingenuous use of language. 

Oh also, I support #boycottNRA
2800 2018-02-23 18:50:48 Patience is key with crypto. What you see is a short term bounce. You’ll see all red leading into Sunday. I personally wouldn’t sell your whole position but maybe a portion. Good luck.
2801 2018-02-23 18:50:39 3) value. Will they slow fade in value? Will some rewrite their code for some other blockchain and survive? I guess the safe thing to do is diversify in different blockchains.

2819 2018-02-23 18:49:16 @TD_Canada  No Visa support to buy crypto currency.   I guess I am not the kind of customer you want to retain.
2820 2018-02-23 18:49:15 2) I agree that Ethereum could go the way of MySpace as competitors have more dapps developed on their platform. At them same time if Ethereum scales well it will stay relevant. The question I was asking was how long will all the projects and investments in those projects hold...
2821 2018-02-23 18:49:07 I love it when a facade gets torn down to reveal crypto-history. There's an abandoned auto-body shop in Bakersfield where if you squint, you can see the lettering from when it was a club Merle and Buck used to play. And once you see it, you can imagine what the street once was.
2822 2018-02-23 18:49:05 If you are eligible I use #USAA for banking and they actually like crypto.  I can even see my $BTC balance in my bank app.  BoA is one if the most toxic banks I have come across imo. I would consider them almost as bad as BB&T who charges $2 to talk to a CS rep about your acct.

2826 2018-02-23 18:48:47 TFW you suggest an avenue for a crypto puzzle and then realize you’d used something exactly like it 2-3 years ago.
2827 2018-02-23 18:48:34 "Communism is centralization masked as decentralization." So Bitcoin Core because last time I checked the masses don't vote either. All crypto has to have a centralization of sorts even if masked as you stated as decentralized. You are on behalf of BTC a pawn for a mask, ironic.

2846 2018-02-23 18:47:09 1) I don't think that there are many projects in all of crypto that have many users. Crypto development is still young. There is competition for just about every dapp as well. Civic is being used a bit, Lunyr is in open Beta, and TenX was working.

2903 2018-02-23 18:42:11 I know that comes off as a crypto fanboi response but the meat of the discussion is more than reasonable for Twitter. Crypto is not (or should not) be about a coin - it’s about the technology.
2904 2018-02-23 18:41:53 そういうことです！

2986 2018-02-23 18:32:34 Yes, during times of "uncertainty" people flee to bitcoin in the same way that during times of recession people flee to gold. It's obvious that bitcoin is (still) the underlying asset which all of crypto is in some form based on and referred to.

3049 2018-02-23 18:25:59 It's interesting to hear "free market capitalist" bitcoiners encouraging the disruption of rent seeking, what I would consider socialism...Simplistic, Reagan US b/w good/bad interpretations of the world make it hard for them to discuss the socialist impact Bitcoin will have

3092 2018-02-23 18:23:17 $7600-7800 end of Feb.  Wall Street hasn't had their dump yet this bear stretch.  Cheaper buy in window for crypto in 1st week of March.  Hang tight!

3103 2018-02-23 18:22:17 Yeah well that is understandable. People should be purchasing crypto with credit. It’s the debit transactions that shouldn’t be denied.
3104 2018-02-23 18:22:14 Morning babe 
3105 2018-02-23 18:22:13 Nope. We didn't join the pre sales as there was not enough information available to get a clear view of the project. I bought a bit when it got listed on exchanges and our group started buying when more and more info came out.

3159 2018-02-23 18:16:31 CryptoCurrency won't be going away anytime soon. Bitcoin on the other hand, will most likely be overtaken in the next year or two. It's a sluggish crypto that is lacking in technology compared to many other coins.

3197 2018-02-23 18:11:46 This is not your work?
3198 2018-02-23 18:11:44 私自身、以前に新規アドレスへのBCH送金でエラーになって、数日放置されたことがありまして、お恥ずかしながらまさにその修正されていないコメントを見て、まだ改善されていないと勘違いしていました。ご提言及びご協力、心より感謝致します。
3199 2018-02-23 18:11:41 its a crypto store im launching in the next couple months and its for my entrepreneur project as well, if you remind me at launch ill give you a free shirt with that graphic!
3200 2018-02-23 18:11:37 well it mainly depends what you do with the money you earned. i would like to see many crypto traders actually giving back to the community by making this world a better place, through either speaking up or using money to make a change
3201 2018-02-23 18:11:37 #WaqarZaka  finaly i got my master nodes and now in Running position. Now just i am waiting Training of #Crypto #Analytics . Thank you @ZakaWaqar for helping us. Now you words in Action... :-) #Cryptoaya also Awesome.. Great.

3203 2018-02-23 18:11:34 Amazing! When is this coming out? Do you know?
3204 2018-02-23 18:11:32 How about people who daily interact with you? 
3205 2018-02-23 18:11:22 That's kind of disease of that #crypto space - majority here just want to execute 'get rich quick' scheme instead of thinking long term.
3206 2018-02-23 18:11:10 I got hungry after seeing @cryptostardust commenting about this food so many times <3
3207 2018-02-23 18:11:02 Like peanut butter and jelly. 
3208 2018-02-23 18:10:53 That will be when the tokens get listed. We will announce this later.
3209 2018-02-23 18:10:40 Crypto currency won’t last long enough to maintain long term investments

3216 2018-02-23 18:10:02 This is a far more insightful comment than many will give it credit for.
3217 2018-02-23 18:10:02 Couldn't agree more, it'll be obsolete within a year, two tops, it would have only ever been a temporary solution for scaling as it would have eventual encountered the same issues, it was a spiteful attempt to steal a brand name and to manipulate investors,roger should be ashamed
3218 2018-02-23 18:09:53 Yeah but can it mine crypto ???

3222 2018-02-23 18:09:23 So another ERC-20 token? Will they do their own thing like EOS or will AION remain on the #ethereum network?
3223 2018-02-23 18:09:18 According to Warren Buffet, the crypto market will have a bad end
3224 2018-02-23 18:09:09 the tech seems solid but can you share more info on how you think the ROI will come into play? Why will the token go up in value and what business adoption are they planning on? In other words, while I can see the tech being a success, I wonder how will they make money?
3225 2018-02-23 18:09:02 :)
3226 2018-02-23 18:09:01 How is BCH fake ? I guess it's in your financial interests to make people think that as BCH very much a true crypto currency. Used to like LTC but it seems it been taken over by unscrupulous fud spreaders resorting to dirty tactics.
3227 2018-02-23 18:08:51 i think what's different now in crypto than two weeks ago is that the market seems less top heavy. people aren't as interested in bringing prices down meaning things have stabilized some.
3228 2018-02-23 18:08:50 I'm loving the current cautious tone and sentiment in Bitcoin and crypto markets at the moment.

3246 2018-02-23 18:07:33 I evangelized crypto today to get out of what was not really an awkward social situation. Can’t wait to sell redemption.
3247 2018-02-23 18:07:31 The writing is on the wall. Old Banks need to adapt or die. They can deem the #crypto assets speculative, but the decentralization of money makes banks unnecessary and they know it

3260 2018-02-23 18:06:22 Everyone seems very bitter about Dim. I agreed with the terms, agreement and disclaimers before purchasing any ico, dont invest what u cant afford to lose. Dim is down because its community lost its trust, and crypto is about community w/o it, it'll die.
3261 2018-02-23 18:06:16 @Kora_Network For many people, the use of crypto-currency payments is a necessary transition from the old financial system. The old system can no longer meet modern requirements. If you look to the future, then you along the way with the company Kora. #Koranetwork

3296 2018-02-23 18:02:37 I guess they will mostly likely die, cause for them to adapt they would need to stop being banks and start doing crypto businesses

3306 2018-02-23 18:01:40 Santander UK does not allow purchase of crypto with CC as banks aren’t allowed to lend for investment purposes, in the same way you can’t borrow money for the stock market. In the UK this falls under FCA guidelines so must be adhered to by all banks. I’d assume similar in the USA
3307 2018-02-23 18:01:36 This is awesome. Crypto needs more devs! Also, will be interesting to see how the tokenization of stipends, partnerships, and placement works out.
3308 2018-02-23 18:01:35 SpankChain follows the same open and inclusive ethos as crypto. All are welcome!

It will be hard, but in 4 years it will all pay back hundred fold. If you keep this still time to get in? attitude you will give up on crypto soon in this market.

3335 2018-02-23 17:59:46 Do you have a chart to back it up or news? My point is that people don’t do enough research on their coins. Like i was looking at XVG at .002 cents because they were talking technically against other privacy tokens. At this moment i believe it is overvalued.

If I am buying stock, I let the profits sit in $.  If I trade a Binance altcoin for ETH, then ETH price drops, then I have lost my profit.

3390 2018-02-25 23:56:32 Too many scams on twitter in the crypto space. The crazy part about it, is that people in the space fall for it. That’s why I created my private membership. Don’t send your info to anyone or log onto any website unofficial.

3392 2018-02-25 23:55:44 2. And allows for the money/token to reflect the value of the utility it provides the market. This equation does little to capture that very real phenomenon. Competition amongst currencies and their perceived utility extrinsically affect them but aren’t reflected in MV=PQ

3418 2018-02-25 23:50:57 $432B crypto market cap with 1512 coins. This is a problem. Many (more) alts both old and new are headed to abyss if the cap stays under $1T. 

Last November when market cap was similar, we had ~300 less coins.
3419 2018-02-25 23:50:44 I’m confused. I thought anyone asking you to send crypto to an account for more crypto in return, was trying to scam people? No?

3423 2018-02-25 23:50:15 Sideways ;)
3424 2018-02-25 23:50:13 If they believe in crypto then this should be a great time to research projects and take positions on new projects or increase positions

3455 2018-02-25 23:44:54 My buy zone is 8700. There are too many people expecting the same area during the Asian or early American session which might limit the downside as traders accept a higher price to not miss the move.

3488 2018-02-25 23:37:37 I was at Whole Foods yesterday, and I ran into a young kid who just sold his startup to some legal tech-related rollup company.

3489 2018-02-25 23:37:28 Haven't you seen how tZero extended ICO period? Why do think this was? Clearly not enough interest. Have you seen their ETH wallet and its dwindling deposits?

3493 2018-02-25 23:37:01 No they aren’t. People have been spreading quantum nonsense since the early 1990s as FUD against crypto and/or blowing smoke to get funding. Literally recycled articles for the last ~30 years.

3495 2018-02-25 23:36:13 There's excess electricity off-peak, currently most everywhere in the world. Increasing utilization of generation facilities w/ crypto mining that runs off-peak only makes those facilities more profitable to operate.
3496 2018-02-25 23:35:50 you guys should look up the article on J-curves in crypto super interesting and applicable to a lot

3509 2018-02-25 23:33:04 A public #blockchain doesn’t care if you’re a Boy Scout or a convicted ax  murderer. As long as you control the private keys to a #bitcoin wallet,  you control the funds in it, no passport required. (Setting up an  account at a #crypto exchange is a different matter.)
3510 2018-02-25 23:32:58 Well you *are* computing a hash, actually many hashes to do the brute forcing you described. You’re suggesting the strategy to reach an end result is not mathematical (I would disagree - see all ML), but I’m saying hash functions themselves count as “math”.

fxで10%増やすのと、アルトで10%増やすのだったら、圧倒的にアルトの方が簡単。間違いなく。
ただ、fxの方が小さい値動きでも利益になるし、ショートもあるから、利益を出す機会が多い。
やはりわたしはアルトが好き。

3521 2018-02-25 23:30:12 You can read my other tweets but I expect people who invest in this ICO to lose all their money. Tzero will only possibly trade on its own non-yet-existing exchange, so how who will they sell to? This will kill the ICO market for real companies with real products.

3537 2018-02-25 23:27:16 Yes, it would.  But: 1. this suggests that rather than waiting until impending doom to sell, people should keep some % of assets in crypto generally, 2. If the group forced to flee is relatively small, the impact may be relatively minor, and

3549 2018-02-25 23:26:04 there's a lot of market manipulation by bots and traders (traders mainly on the weekends I've noticed).  it's one of the things that really sucks about crypto. all I can come up with.

3554 2018-02-25 23:24:59 Things are quiet on the Bitcoin/crypto front. Reminds me of a time not long ago when no one was proclaiming that our inability to have distributed verification of ledgers was holding back the economy and society.
3555 2018-02-25 23:24:46 I won't check crypto prices till my next paycheck. I'm in it for the long-term anyways, so no point in checking the price on a daily basis.
3556 2018-02-25 23:24:44 Take a step back and see that (nearly) the entire crypto space is innovative and failures are only learning opportunities. I welcome the market deciding what's valuable and what's not.

3559 2018-02-25 23:24:27 Yes you are correct they have not specifically stated “use FIFO”but that is the standard treatment of calculating gains/losses in all other areas of tax law so my firm feels strongly that our clients should use FIFO.

3562 2018-02-25 23:23:32 Usually when an exchange’s wallet doesn’t work it is the exchange that needs to update something ... best to submit enough support tickets to Poloniex to force them to fix it. Could just be as simple as am updating their wallet?
3563 2018-02-25 23:23:25 People need to understand that market currently is not so bearish at all, despite BTC pulling back, a lot of altcoins are going up in both Satoshi and USD value. It's a healthy sign.
3564 2018-02-25 23:23:17 Fibonacci model can still explain what is happening in crypto market? I wonder if someone could test this theory against bitcoin market data....

3567 2018-02-25 23:23:01 Currently the capital expenditure for most crypto-mining hardware is so high that the cost of electricity is still a lesser fraction of the miner's expense over that hardware's useful life. That's because there's a supply constraint and mining hardware vendors charging a premium.

If you must claim an airdrop then move funds to a new wallet before claiming the airdrop via the old wallet. Empty old wallet of airdrop funds and never use it again.

3594 2018-02-25 23:19:25 Not everyone is a seasoned trader though. Coinbase has been the entry way into crypto for many newbies.

3603 2018-02-25 23:18:03 Well for me personally, I've made a lot of money in crypto, so I've got a bias towards it.  More importantly, I think traditional fiat currencies are screwed in the long term (coming 20 years).  So I like the potential of a technology solving the manipulation of the m0 currency.
3604 2018-02-25 23:17:54 Thanks, this tweet is refreshing. There's a lot of knocking of noobs on crypto twitter. Good to see someone who recognizes it's still early and we can all make money together.

3608 2018-02-25 23:17:17 I was a victim of following media hype when I first entered the Crypto community.  I had originally ignored the medias paths & advice. I applied my penny stock methods to this. 2016 I had 25k XRP, 25K XLM, and 5K EOS,2017JanCrash+haters I sold 75%. This kept me from my 1stmill.
3609 2018-02-25 23:17:02 Staking limit isn't even set yet. The EF seems strongly committed to uphold or rather increase the decentralized character of its Blockchain, so I'd say it is fair to assume the staking limit will be set accordingly.

3611 2018-02-25 23:16:59 Holy shit one of them is talking crypto currency
3612 2018-02-25 23:16:53 So you guys think that it's healthy that credit card companies get to decide what we are allowed to buy? And i dont think that its about risk here. More about banks losing power to crypto.
3613 2018-02-25 23:16:39 I think the multiple hours of wait time for confirmations is what keeps people away. If a crypto takes that long for confirmations i won't use it.
3614 2018-02-25 23:15:57 well, even Elon Musk who himself is not investing in crypto contacted the CEO of Twitter regarding these scams and yet nothing has happened...
3615 2018-02-25 23:15:54 Thank you. No need to go into screenshot effort!  BTW: TA is extremely mixed right now. About 5hrs ago it began showing that a correction on the upside can be made. At that point it was clear it would not break today. Still weak as long as its under 9.9k.
3616 2018-02-25 23:15:50 What about tether?
3617 2018-02-25 23:15:43 I'm new to following you. It's very refreshing to see a highly followed crypto trader give advice to and be so supportive of newer traders/investors. Awesome. Because there is a lot of arrogance and "sucks to be you" among you. 
3618 2018-02-25 23:15:39 I think you will find that banks are not involved.  They may be interested in the blockchain but not the crypto currencies themselves.
3619 2018-02-25 23:15:35 This person is lying. It's a scam account made to try to elicit money from people.
3620 2018-02-25 23:15:35 The cap of the entire market will probably go up 5x this year so that is nothing. They are getting closer to a real product that is going to take over crypto. 5x is conservative should go even higher than this.

3629 2018-02-25 23:13:43 Please don’t stop! You  have no idea the many ways you are helping and blessing people!  I’ve been wanting to buy a food truck that serves free food in poor areas.  It’s my dream and investing in crypto is making me think one day it will come true.  So that’s why I say thank you
3630 2018-02-25 23:13:18 where are we with the announcement? :) @neonexchange
3631 2018-02-25 23:13:15 Entire Y axis is BTC price except the Short price point which is 21748 (red colored, number of Bitcoins)
3632 2018-02-25 23:13:09 Thanks for sharing this Don. Not sure I've quite grasped it on first look but I'll go over it a few times until it makes sense. Appreciate you doing these educational charts, v helpful

3634 2018-02-25 23:12:30 I’d say all. Crypto people tend to consume higher quality foods instead of processed garbage.
3635 2018-02-25 23:12:29 1. Rebalance (trim winners, add to losers)  2) As your account grows diversify...not just in crypto but buy stocks/pay off house/etc.
3636 2018-02-25 23:12:15 What is the point of the entire crypto market if this is the case... anyone?
3637 2018-02-25 23:12:10 Where are all the cute crypto nerds at ;)
3638 2018-02-25 23:12:06 What a Team. One who Took drugs and admitted to it (Agassi) is Now Training Nole who has been cheating the System for the last 10 years by taking drugs.

A Cheaters team lol
3639 2018-02-25 23:11:46 @bitconnect coin is like the fucking zombie crypto. I Have a feeling we are going to see alot more random pumps coming.

3643 2018-02-25 23:11:07 @AriDavidPaul Hi Ari, I see that you are attending Blockstack Berlin. You are a big inspiration in my crypto journey and would love the opportunity to meet in person. Are you by any chance free to catch up on Thursday or Friday evening ? Thanks. Rahul
3644 2018-02-25 23:11:03 Yeah I think that was part of it the other part was ppl believing in his/her/them vision. If no one believed in it we be back at square 1. That's what's beautiful about crypto. Sparked an idea that is influencing the world one person at time.
3645 2018-02-25 23:10:59 The Absence of a Receipt System in Decentralized Crypto-payments is a good idea, well done!
3646 2018-02-25 23:10:54 Yea Like Bitcoin to Litecoin 
3647 2018-02-25 23:10:46 Stay away from this! There is no basis on how they developed this crypto. It is just another scam and a money laundering initiative for their corrupt government. Welcome to the Narcodictatorcoin!

3650 2018-02-25 23:09:49 Cobinhood coin, great exchange zero fees, planned to be decentralised, good interface and team. Coins keep being added, 54.5 million market cap, standing at $0.15 dollar. Great growth potential if compared to kucoin coin or binance coin
3651 2018-02-25 23:09:48 For those of you in crypto 6-12 months (or less) this is your chance to study. 

Stop looking for signals and bonuses, just study and have fresh powder ready in a few weeks to buy all the gems you find.

You got this
3652 2018-02-25 23:09:21 Don't be too hard on yourselves, we are still in the first inning for Crypto.
3653 2018-02-25 23:09:16 BCHの取り出し完了。Electron Cashをインストールすると，Electrumに入っているウォレットが全部見え，BCHが動かせるので，用意しておいた別のBCHウォレットにすぐに送金。送金手数料もBTCよりずっと安かった。private keyでの移動よりずっと楽。

3658 2018-02-25 23:08:46 Is this still valid??
3659 2018-02-25 23:08:44 @THETOPICisCOOL the futures people have ruined the great volatility of crypto. No fun anymore. Just buy hold and wait
3660 2018-02-25 23:08:36 I believe the recognised etiquette is to ask “When moon sir”

3663 2018-02-25 23:08:27 Seriously I'm Flattered that a Crypto YouTube superstar likes to pull his topics from my tweets,  It's cool.  However, can you at least give me shout out for it?  Much Appreciated! thx
3664 2018-02-25 23:08:20 
Hilarious! It will catch on evenutally. ;)
3665 2018-02-25 23:08:09 The coins are worth more when returned. By locking up that many coins from sale, the entire crypto economy benefited. Good Samaritan? I think not, but useful perhaps.
3666 2018-02-25 23:07:58 Your a shit coin pumper, bag holder therapy.. suicide watch enthusiasts!
3667 2018-02-25 23:07:54 The problem when reporting capital gains or losses to the IRS is most of the time all the IRS knows for sure is what you sold and how much you received. The burden of proof is always on the taxpayer to be able to prove their cost basis.
3668 2018-02-25 23:07:42 Which one do you think will have the higher run up the next time around? DGB or XVG

3672 2018-02-25 23:07:01 @officialmcafee remember, you are one of the biggest influencers in this community. the people listen to you and throw out #DYOR when you tweet. newcomers to #crypto look to you for advice. we need to do a better job or we will all fail. #HODLgang
3673 2018-02-25 23:06:56 All part of the game bruh. Wherever there’s money and especially in a “regulated” grey area, there’s jackers. A lot of these Crypto experts bragging about easy money are just putting a target on their back. Simple street knowledge ! 
3674 2018-02-25 23:06:55 No what does 8.9 mean?
3675 2018-02-25 23:06:51 「草コインは将来ホールドすれば、必ず利益になる！」というツイートを見かけるけど、それは誰かが保証してるから？単なる願望や信念だと思うけど、一番やっちゃいけないパターンだと思う。チャート分析して、自分の売買ルールを定め、買いサインが出たら買う、損切りも行う、それが大事。
3676 2018-02-25 23:06:48 Rızayı dinleyip XLM'i 3500'den sattım. Şu an 3700 olmuş ama olsun, Crypto Lobisine kazandırmamış olduk, sağolasın Rıza baba

3737 2018-02-25 22:58:45 I love how “Liberty Hangout” doesn’t tweet anything Liberty or libertarian related (or they have a twisted view of the definitions) but sound more like crypto fascists and authoritarian thugs. Funny, that 
3738 2018-02-25 22:58:28 Remember that every single person in crypto has been wrong about something at some point in the past, and will be wrong again in the future 

It’s part of the process: there's nothing wrong with changing your mind

3741 2018-02-25 22:58:03 Anyone that says they’re a Blockchain or crypto ‘expert’ is a straight up liar
3742 2018-02-25 22:58:02 The classic definition of "crypto-fascist" is one who purports to be liberal yet secret supports totalitarianism. Image is, with one hand, providing free comics to troops for public show but tacitly supports, with the other, an employee who wishes said troops would die.  #Legit

3748 2018-02-25 22:57:08 Also, debt can be issued in the form of govt bonds. Given the alleged huge derivates exposure still unwinding perhaps in Deutsche Bank and elsewhere & perhaps question marks over crypto currency, UK debt would always be sought after! UK govt spend not dependent on EU money!
3749 2018-02-25 22:56:53 @SmartTipps What crypto would you recommend buying now on binance that’s undervalued??
3750 2018-02-25 22:56:49 It sounds like intentional slandering is what it sounds like. There are fake accounts for many figureheads of crypto, why single out Justin and make it seem as if HES scamming? False slander
3751 2018-02-25 22:56:46 He’s such a huge voice in this world of #crypto, that he could have took the time and tweeted out facts. Not #FUD.
3752 2018-02-25 22:56:44 Are you trying to be funny by not including ADA ?
3753 2018-02-25 22:56:28 Hilarious 
3754 2018-02-25 22:56:21 It is crazy , now there are loads of fake  accounts replying to the initial fake giveaway account that they received the crypto...

3759 2018-02-25 22:55:53 why do they keep retweeting old stuff? running out of content? but thanks for the retweet, coz every time i see article like this i will buy a bit more, because it shows how this is just the beginning...  as long as mainstream media are negative about this tech i am still buying
3760 2018-02-25 22:55:45 You should look up "tzero" instead of "tzero ico". "Tzero ico" is based on very little data. This is relative interest compared to all searches from the country and there are many fewer Internet (and Google) users in South Korea than in the U.S., so the total difference is large.
3761 2018-02-25 22:55:42 Only matter of time, definitely gonna give btc a chase in crypto
3762 2018-02-25 22:55:31 Different tax rules in the U.K. but over here you could in theory borrow using something like SALT or LEND using crypto as collateral to avoid crystallising gains. Not a perfect solution but good tax deferral strategy.
3763 2018-02-25 22:55:20 An exercise bike that mines $crypto with the energy you expend. No there’s an idea.
3764 2018-02-25 22:55:07 @CFTC @giancarloCFTC @SEC_News when will you all launch an investigation into @MichaelStollair and @TBISINC for their Ico fiasco? Time to show theses scammers who the Bosses are. #btc $BTC $ETH #ethereum #cryptocurrency #crypto #blockchain

3766 2018-02-25 22:54:46 Make sure you calculate your capital gains correctly. The IRS is using the FIFO method. Also you could evaluate your holdings and “ take a loss or small gain on something to offset your 2018 capital gains. Do not use turbo tax. Get a qualified Accountant/CPA to help you.

3770 2018-02-25 22:54:01 I noticed.  I thought the picture was cool.  First time I've seen that one.
3771 2018-02-25 22:53:55 It's not a scam -.- That's a good example of a core supporter fighting for his investment. They are scared, that's it. 

I just don't get the attitude of some people
3772 2018-02-25 22:53:50 Write in: Blockmason
3773 2018-02-25 22:53:32 Yes mais c'est l'économie crypto, les gens aiment les frais bas et ça se comprend
3774 2018-02-25 22:53:11 It's not there
3775 2018-02-25 22:53:10 One of the most important things in $crypto , cannot be hacked: Your knowledge 

(But still, stay safe out there folks! )
3776 2018-02-25 22:52:12 I tend to feel the same way.  Consider this though, most in the U.S. that are just learning about Crypto will go to Coinbase due to conditioning. Accessibility = More bought = Higher $XRP $ value....maybe I'm wrong ?
3777 2018-02-25 22:51:56 Tried to reply Bitcon with nect slashed, hard to do strikethrough text on Twitter! lol
3778 2018-02-25 22:51:49 @Crypto_Ed_NL brought that up recently happened to him

3780 2018-02-25 22:51:34 Don’t need crypto to do that.  Treat people wrong?  Hold my beer.
3781 2018-02-25 22:51:33 US treasury loves crypto...higher it goes, more tax revenue
3782 2018-02-25 22:51:21 There are many unicorns!! Lots of lovely ladies in crypto. 
3783 2018-02-25 22:51:17 2018 has all ready been a year of firsts for me. Yes I know it's only February. I own stocks and some crypto. And hopefully soon will be a home owner.
3784 2018-02-25 22:51:12 Holding for the fundamentals and not for the hype. I think you might be clueless on the issues at hand here...
3785 2018-02-25 22:51:11 Nogmaals, crypto gaat niet over geld, dat je het OOK kunt gebruiken als geld is mooi maar is slechts 1 Vd duizenden toepassingen. Crypto gaat icm IOT zo gigantisch groot worden, daar kan nog niemand zich een voorstelling van maken. En btc is voorlopig het moederschip.
3786 2018-02-25 22:51:09 Move your money into crypto
3787 2018-02-25 22:51:06 crypto has been an eye opening journey so far. I am mostly humbled by so many smart people that I would have never known existed. Not talking about professors or big shot investors who got a lucky break. Mostly independent researchers and reddit and twitter geniuses. #humbled
3788 2018-02-25 22:51:06 #SegWit is a software #fork (Aug 24, 2017) fixing malleability (receive #crypto payment twice by #hacking signatures) moving signatures out of the transaction data and increases block size from 1 to 1.8 MB. This makes Bitcoin safer/faster/reduce fees, hence prep #LightningNetwork

3792 2018-02-25 22:50:39 I can definitely understand this, and partly agree with it.  I think a lot of people are trigger happy with crypto in general. That all comes from within oneself. There's a lot of people on here that do it, I just sit back and peep. But I'll agree.

3794 2018-02-25 22:50:11 Hi. I have sent various emails regarding the initial free HC coins after each 0.02BTC when the HC was at $0.90. I still haven’t received my 90 coins. I am worried that I wrote multiple emails and no response yet.
3795 2018-02-25 22:49:55 John needs to do a better job. As I stated, he was the shit when he first came on board promoting crypto.
3796 2018-02-25 22:49:53 ohhh thought you sold everything. You were asking everyone to be cautious because mid term crypto is going to crash. Isn't it?
3797 2018-02-25 22:49:52 Ada makes the most sense. Xrp not even crypto. Ada the next highest market cap.
3798 2018-02-25 22:49:48 interested
3799 2018-02-25 22:49:46 thanks bro!  Hope your arm feels better soon. 
3800 2018-02-25 22:49:35 can someone from china (or you mr. sun yourself) eleborate a little bit on why exactly do you see this as "good news for crypto"? thanx for explaining.
3801 2018-02-25 22:49:35 The people killing the community are the people who scam all the new comers and make it so they never want to be involved in crypto again. That is what he attempted to impede from happening. And reckless or careless is one thing, you accused him of intentionally misquoting....
3802 2018-02-25 22:49:34 Agreed.  Going to try and pick up some more
3803 2018-02-25 22:49:34 @primalbasehq is one of the best kept secrets in crypto; pick up some $PBT before it completely upends the workspace industry

3807 2018-02-25 22:49:26 You forgot @DiviProject  under markets ;)
3808 2018-02-25 22:49:21 People get all JG Wentworth with it..."I want my crypto and I want it now"!!! Pay the fees then
3809 2018-02-25 22:49:20 Creating my own crypto currency called Lit Coin. It can only be used to purchase booze, drugs, and Taco Bell.
3810 2018-02-25 22:48:52 That's just some one being simple minded and for themselves. Now.. I think we can all agree on someone that MOST LIKELY did a few months back. Will we ever find out the truth, probably not.  But @officialmcafee definitely has good intentions towards crypto in general.
3811 2018-02-25 22:48:51 watching Doug Polk buy 100K worth of user voted crypto is very weird.
3812 2018-02-25 22:48:35 Not sure if it is much different than the discussion threads for about any other crypto project
3813 2018-02-25 22:48:33 Nice idea as Pumapay suggests early and future payment plans for our children; future Crypto payments!

3815 2018-02-25 22:48:25 De motivatie boeit niet, het gaat er om dat de IOT/crypto markt gigantisch gaat worden en dat steeds meer mensen en landen dat gaan onderkennen. En nogmaals, het gaat om de bitcoin technologie, niet om wat een bitcoin of andere crypto waard is vandaag.

3822 2018-02-25 22:47:17 Looking for good recommendations on my next crypto purchase. Slowly looking to get more invested and diversify. I own TRX, LEND, and XRP. What next? If you need a Binanave reference code when you sign up, hit me up.
3823 2018-02-25 22:47:05 Saw this exact graph on Reddit... hmmmm
3824 2018-02-25 22:46:55 lemme check it fo ya :>
3825 2018-02-25 22:46:52 I’m so tired of people saying “Crypto isn’t fun anymore, where are my gains?” People you have stop thinking so short term! The profits will come if you focus less on gains and more on the projects that you invest in. Come on man! Do better!

3837 2018-02-25 22:45:14 Hay gente que elige la crypto equivocada, yo la quedé con el Mansions of madness primera edición. No te lo canjean ni por un Pictionary.
3838 2018-02-25 22:44:59 A good crypto portfolio is well balanced.

40% BTC, 30% ETH, 20% LTC (even 30%/30%/30%) & 10% altcoins is a great way to go. Specifically, I would recommend 7% alts you truly believe in, 2% speculative alts & 1% highly speculative alts (or ICOs).

3848 2018-02-25 22:44:19 My favorite thing about $XRP is that it is faster, more scalable, and has a better feature set than any other crypto and does all of that without perverse incentives or the externalization of its security cost onto future generations.
3849 2018-02-25 22:44:18 この感じってなんとなくだけど暴騰か暴落の前に多いイメージなんよね。

3911 2018-02-25 22:35:48 Oh, and now I remember how they brought an injunction against the team that broke their key fob crypto.  Yep, maybe some other brand.

3914 2018-02-25 22:35:25 Yea I think some auto account liked one of my comments because my pinned one has only a few likes and like 172 retweets which I thought was super odd. Happened a while ago.
3915 2018-02-25 22:35:25 Crypto’s are on an upturn...predicting a nice week for #LTC !!! As far as Wall Street is concerned...play the swings with #SVXY and #UVXY !!! Don’t fall in love with the market just yet...keep your options open!!! #investmentmob
3916 2018-02-25 22:35:22 Why would anyone want to buy crypto on Robinhood. You can't even withdraw from it. Horrible! Till then I am not touching it with a 10 foot pole

3922 2018-02-25 22:33:58 Its so much lower though, the only thing that aucks is the withdraw speed of btc to a wallet
3923 2018-02-25 22:33:57 Will you be able to run a crypto currency from jail tho?
3924 2018-02-25 22:33:51 I don't know which one is going to pump first..... XMR or ZEC. But when they go, they will bring the entire privacy coin market up with them. The real flippening is when privacy based crypto has more market than non privacy based.
3925 2018-02-25 22:33:44 Who in their right mind would send crypto to win crypto? !?!
3926 2018-02-25 22:33:43 McAfee seems to continually make more problems for the crypto space than any other one person from what I have seen.
3927 2018-02-25 22:33:37 How long you been in crypto @chasecryptobtc like 6 months, pleeb ass answer for sure
3928 2018-02-25 22:33:29 Look down the timeline of the hacked account. It’s obvious it was someone popular who previously had the account.
3929 2018-02-25 22:33:26 The scammers are hacking (or buying hacked) verified accounts and editing them to look like crypto currency people.
In the example, it is easy to see the misspelling of Justin Sun’s twitter handle.

3934 2018-02-25 22:32:44 Probably the ducks lighting themself on fire after being fed old butt bread 
3935 2018-02-25 22:32:30 First and foremost, most MSM has a particular agenda. There is no such thing as unbiased reporting anymore. Plus the fact that relatively few in society understand crypto enough to even talk about it, much less discuss it intelligently. So, I’d have to vote no.
3936 2018-02-25 22:32:09 Still wondering how your ABC looks like then.
Mine looks totally weird when trying to adapting to your changes.
3937 2018-02-25 22:32:08 Eso se verá.
3938 2018-02-25 22:31:52 This is a personal twitter, if you want crypto talk why not follow @ADAcoin_ , @emurgo_io, @CardanoStiftung or @InputOutputHK. I follow @IOHK_Charles because he post interesting photos of him promoting  Cardano and tasty looking food!!
3939 2018-02-25 22:31:46 Price targets are nearly impossible to predict far out but here's my #crypto outlook for 2018.

Im looking forward for what is coming

3969 2018-02-25 22:28:08 Be careful, possible virus to take crypto. DETECTED!
3970 2018-02-25 22:28:04 I could get behind that if it wasn‘t for those two slices of tomato. Don‘t know why people like that red water
3971 2018-02-25 22:27:58 Okay... I'm the idiot. Didn't see the overlapping of 1 and 4 when adapting...
3972 2018-02-25 22:27:22 What makes you think so?
3973 2018-02-25 22:27:10 Learning mining and spec mining new coins, setting up cloudminers, trying out credit card gift cards to get accounts, I have started to see the potential for terrorists and organized crime to use crypto. Basically my behavior patterns are likely falling into the same signatures.
3974 2018-02-25 22:27:10 Do you know what market cap and circulating are?
3975 2018-02-25 22:26:37 It isn't just crypto that's the cause. Btw if you watch best buy they have founders editions cards in stock 1 to 2 times a week at 429. Then there's the next line supposedly coming out soon.
3976 2018-02-25 22:26:31 * what's wrong with religion and crypto...
3977 2018-02-25 22:26:12 I got a signal from a group that it will have a breakout
3978 2018-02-25 22:26:09 Esto no te lo creéis ni tú. Vosotros bailas al ritmo que vuestros dioses os marcan, incluso votando prófugos en Bélgica que siguen prometiéndo cosas ilegales, inviables e ilegitimas porque sólo representan al 47% de Cataluña.
3979 2018-02-25 22:25:55 Please mocho get some more followers, that 99k annoys me 
3980 2018-02-25 22:25:48 Why does every bot I run across these days tweet about bitcoin or crypto currency?
3981 2018-02-25 22:25:33 whoshearts TheGemClub I still don't see it happening, but I am keeping watch on the charts.  $BTC would need to trade sideways and I just don't see that happening until we hit another peak or drop down to strong support
3982 2018-02-25 22:25:27 Invest in crypto pre 2017 and I wouldn’t doubt it
3983 2018-02-25 22:25:27 Yok yahu ne alaka! Elbette arada ard niyetli maniplatör ve sinsi çıkarcılar her zaman olabilir ama biz de her hıyarım diyene elimizde tuzlukla koşmuyoruz ki... Deneyip sınamadan, gözlemleyip teyit etmeden ve kendi araştırmamızı yapmadan bodoslama dalıyorsak zaten geçmiş olsun.

3985 2018-02-25 22:25:02 I was watching @binance_2017 but there didn’t seem to be a dump or anything of the sort as I expected. And yes it could have been worded better, but at the same time the accounts were down minutes after this tweet so no one else could have got hurt. So some credit is due.
3986 2018-02-25 22:24:58 I agree Eirther Amazon figures out how to do this and sweep crypto into safe storage by the minute or they may just do their own crypto. It comes down to dollars which is more cost effective.  I don't know the ceos stance on crypto.
3987 2018-02-25 22:24:57 Crypto doesn’t need banks, isn’t that the whole point!
3988 2018-02-25 22:24:39 Launching to the syscoin galaxy?
3989 2018-02-25 22:24:28 People who believe bitcoin is hitting 2k won’t be holding any bitcoin at 10k. That would be stupid on their part unless they hedge them selves
3990 2018-02-25 22:24:16 It might be the floor for DRGN it might not... but all i know is that it was a hyped ICO and history might repeat itself. I mean it’s already lost around 75% if it’s value from the top I’d doubt it would fall much further. EOS lost like 80-90%, but the market was different then.
3991 2018-02-25 22:24:03 Evening guys! Hope you've had a great weekend. I'm super excited to see the return of the bull in the coming weeks!

4012 2018-02-25 22:21:12 I think John's tweet could have been worded better. It just sounds like Tron themselves are scamming people by reading it. A bit like when the media announces bad crypto news so the market reacts

4032 2018-02-25 22:19:17 NEO and VEN are no competitors. They are different Vechain is a blockchain that helps people determine the quality and authenticity of a product. NEO is a complete smart economy for now and the future.

4034 2018-02-25 22:18:46 Everyone needs to remember.  No one on Twitter is going to give you free crypto, do not anyone your private key. Not even you GF. She will just bang your neighbor and empty your wallet 
4035 2018-02-25 22:18:44 I was asked to setup a crypto fund where all employees received a bonus , the same, being with us. Very funny idea, but not an easy one. Taxes, when to get out. What to invest, 100% xrp would be weird. Has anybody dealt with this? And so yes I am allowed to look at crypto

4053 2018-02-25 22:16:18 Haha, thank you, El Crypto 
4054 2018-02-25 22:16:16 Defendió a España???? Los poderes se unieron en favor de unos de los socios de su club. No confundas. Las portadas de los periódicos internacionales hablaban de vergüenza!
4055 2018-02-25 22:16:14 @verified @Twitter this needs to be explained! How did this fake profile get a blue checkmark? Need to know how this happened @Crypto_Newz
4056 2018-02-25 22:16:11 I just try to live in full acceptance of that which I cannot control. Which is mostly everything. 
4057 2018-02-25 22:15:46 Touché. But I know people dumping a shit ton of money in and have no fucking clue why other than they’re hoping to turn a quick profit. That concerns me a bit. Hoping we (as a community) find an easier way to educate. The grandparents explain crypto contest is a good start.
4058 2018-02-25 22:15:43 McAfee is making crypto rekt.
4059 2018-02-25 22:15:41 Good project Combination of blockchain technology with educational programs to teach people about crypto power. #BitcoinHomework #ExtraCredit #TokenSale #blockchain
4060 2018-02-25 22:15:41 omfg it's too good to be true haha! omg my sides hurt. An indicator at how ridiculous the crypto market has gotten. People actually bought coins this guy called at one point.
4061 2018-02-25 22:15:24 Who's making these calls?
4062 2018-02-25 22:15:12 Eso fue cierto hace 15 años, después Pujol empezó esto que Mas (con poco cálculo estadista) explotó hace dos o tres años:el independetismo para ocultar la corrupción y empezar el negocio redondo del separatismo.

4070 2018-02-25 22:14:22 La inacción del PP, la virulencia de Cs y la connivencia del PSOE nos han llevado hasta aquí. Si se hubiera votado de forma pactada ya estaría resuelto. Sin crispaciones. Pero España no es una democracia plena...
4071 2018-02-25 22:14:16  mcafee @ his best
4072 2018-02-25 22:14:16 you say "*Supply ONLY 15,762,205 $XMR " but you do realize XMR doesnt have a limited supply right?
4073 2018-02-25 22:14:12 Crypto was made to be out of regulation. But depends on lot of factors. It's like those debates that always will exist. (Eg like pro cap'ism s com'ism) - Btc vs state backed crypto. Remember, many governmens have failed in past. But most likely Btc might out live even govts
4074 2018-02-25 22:14:09 Anything is possible I suppose. Especially insider knowledge.
4075 2018-02-25 22:14:07 Fuck you and your ancient israel. Besides Palestinians may speak arabic but most of them are decedents of jews, therefore they inherit it.

4077 2018-02-25 22:13:56 ..weekly updates, video proof of working product, a non anonymous team that actually has the experience to pull this off, and an actual physical SUB office location where you can stop by and meet the team.  If this has you nervous then maybe you should sell. Me I'm not selling!!

4082 2018-02-25 22:13:21 Got to watch out for sponsored google ads that are getting people in with the inconspicuous dots under 1-2 letters of the URL - would’ve got so many people already !
4083 2018-02-25 22:13:09 Guys please improve your twitter activity qualitatively. Crypto Twitter was much fun back in 1910s.
4084 2018-02-25 22:13:02 Hmm, I don’t see $ZEC on here.
4085 2018-02-25 22:12:59 NO!
4086 2018-02-25 22:12:59 No feijao, what a disappointmement
4087 2018-02-25 22:12:52 No. I think you are the loser, I sold out at 37 Satoshi.
4088 2018-02-25 22:12:50 Aside: we need a crypto social network where hash commitments like this are built into the platform.
4089 2018-02-25 22:12:48 How bout the bitcoin itself?
4090 2018-02-25 22:12:40 Gotta be some loophole cause I’ve seen several fake verified accounts. Unless twitter is hacked or an employee in on it

4094 2018-02-25 22:12:05 have you ever had bacon and egg soup tho
4095 2018-02-25 22:11:56 Uh yea
4096 2018-02-25 22:11:48 you're right, I've also entered this crazy crypto world in November, 2017 and try to learn about all interesting stuff...I'm bot also sure about cardano but they have a very good team and i think they want to make sure everything goes smoothly before launching the blockchain
4097 2018-02-25 22:11:45 Carrie demonstrating the $5 wrench theory of crypto with some aplomb there
4098 2018-02-25 22:11:41 You're a loser
4099 2018-02-25 22:11:36 Thanks man, appreciate it. I’m doing crypto mining parts, they’re a dime a dozen, but wanted to do something rather than wait for the perfect idea
4100 2018-02-25 22:11:35 When did your account get hacked by a 12 year old?
4101 2018-02-25 22:11:32 Pero qué mentirosa estás resultando!!! Salió en toda la prensa internacional y los partes médicos se hicieron. Incluso los médicos se ofendieron con la negación por parte del gob d España.
4102 2018-02-25 22:11:27 Thank you for this great overview!

4113 2018-02-25 22:10:10 Eggs and bacon > soup
4114 2018-02-25 22:10:03 Once you get verified and change the Twitter handle, you lose the badge and have to reapply.
4115 2018-02-25 22:10:01 Yes, we are nowhere near any kind of mass adoption. Most people have heard of crypto but most people don't have any and those that do don't actually use it. We are in the early stages still.
4116 2018-02-25 22:09:58 First it's "Oh my goodness they aren't communicating enough", and now it's "Well, they're communicating and I don't like what they're saying". You can't satisfy everyone; I guess you're part of that group. . I think you'll regret it in a couple months, not a year.
4117 2018-02-25 22:09:46 mentira. Si lo quisiérais de verdad, lo habríais preparado de verdad. Mucha mani, mucho discurso... Pero a la hora de la verdad, NADA. Ni procedimiento legal, NI LAS ESTRUCTURAS DEL ESTADO preparadas. Todo humo. Nada real.
4118 2018-02-25 22:09:45 No mientas!!! Siempre hemos defendido que podáis votar todos!! Varios votaron No el 1 de octubre y se les aplaudió. Votar es la forma más civilizada de resolver conflictos.
4119 2018-02-25 22:09:26 So these companies that ripple have partnerships. are they going to use the xrp tokens or just the private ripple network?
4120 2018-02-25 22:09:24 Crypto Twitter: Yo Twitter you need to do something about those fake accounts trying to scam people

Twitter: Yeah sure! Let us verify a fake Twitter account! That would help right?

$TRX $BTC $ETH
4121 2018-02-25 22:09:14 @PACcoinOfficial should we not touch our paccoin in cryptopia?

4123 2018-02-25 22:09:10 Crypto_Rach justinsuntron But verified by Twitter. Crazy huh?
4124 2018-02-25 22:09:07 I personally liked the superman version better @Crypto_Movement
4125 2018-02-25 22:09:01 it was a fake Justin sun account that was really verified
4126 2018-02-25 22:08:54 BTCウォレットを見ていていつも困ることは，

今回，2つの送金が纏められ，同時期に別の入金があり混乱。そのため未着金があると思ってしまった。
送金元にトランザクション情報があり助かった。

4129 2018-02-25 22:08:43 It's a tech project, what do you expect? They've started from the protocol level, dude. If you think you can add onto the internet and change the entire world in 6 months then go right ahead. The guys are doing their best to provide a badass product. The ones who HOLD will win.
4130 2018-02-25 22:08:35 あそこ割ってたらほぼ確実にZaifが落ちるような酷い状況になってたと思うのであながち間違いではないと思います…w
4131 2018-02-25 22:08:28 Yes, I loaded up on silver and dumped it recently at a loss. PM miners have been disappointing also the crypto miners. S&P 500 the clear place to be and hopefully cryptos will be next.
4132 2018-02-25 22:08:26 @Crypto_Soup @Crypto_Soup @Crypto_Soup
4133 2018-02-25 22:08:21 twitter is a mess, verified doesn't mean a thing, imposters are ruining crypto twitter and it's only going to get worse. we need a new twitter.
4134 2018-02-25 22:08:16 He is a troll. Checked some of his daily posts and he switches his mind even faster as @22loops leaves and returns crypto Twitter
4135 2018-02-25 22:08:10 Where have you put your crypto investments?
4136 2018-02-25 22:08:07 with 90k +followers.  way crazy!
4137 2018-02-25 22:07:57 I would love to wake up and start the week with ether trex or binance announcing $zcl $btcp and $etc $clo support

4138 2018-02-25 22:07:50 I quit after I got called into a meeting for talking about Bitcoin too much. 
You can never talk about crypto too much.

4140 2018-02-25 22:07:45 FUERZA? el fuego amigo es el peor. Ex govern es lo q buscaba. Estamos esperando aún los 1000 PARTES MÉDICOS. sólo se vio barricadas humanas muy preparadas ENFRENTÁNDOSE  a policía. Ese día EL MUNDO SÍ OS CONOCIÓ. Y os vetó!! Mala jugada.
4141 2018-02-25 22:07:40 I like when you talk about crypto better
4142 2018-02-25 22:07:38 That one tip is around a penny.  It is unfair to generalize using a single instance as an example.  I have seen tips up to 5 xrp.  Again you belittle a method in which an individual created as a way to say thank you for contributions PAID by the community.  its p2p comm support.
4143 2018-02-25 22:07:34 Eso lo habéis hecho vosotros con los catalanes que no pensamos como vosotros: fuerza, represión e intento de imposición ilegal.

4155 2018-02-25 22:06:43 Call the FBI?  WTF are they going to do?  That's about as a logical as you telling the world you planned on eating your own pecker if a coin didn't hit a specific value.  Or that you paid for hookers and weed with your crypto.  Please, spare me the bullshit.

4166 2018-02-25 22:05:36 @Changelly_team said they would take a look but we haven't heard back.
4167 2018-02-25 22:05:29 It’s not that hard to get a verified account and change the name
4168 2018-02-25 22:05:18 Crypto_Rach justinsuntron But verified by Twitter. Crazy huh?
4169 2018-02-25 22:05:08 Well that's all ready done by vertcoin VTC the people's coin

4174 2018-02-25 22:04:45 folloooow mee, and you'll see, this new wooooorld of #crypto infestation (willy wonka style)
4175 2018-02-25 22:04:38 La reivindicación en su origen no era la independencia. No lo recuerdas?? Pero viendo que no hay más salida que callar, bajar la cabeza, acatar, bajarse los pantalones ... Pues no. Viendo q no hay encaje, q no nos tratan como parte de España, pues nada, mejor vecinos.
4176 2018-02-25 22:04:31 My love for #Litecoin and #LiteCoinConfessions.

So I originally purchased #LTC at $37 and held, sold half of my holdings above $300 and then doubled my holdings by buying back under $100.

4177 2018-02-25 22:04:20 Why are you so sure about this? 
The "this time it's different" mindset is an ongoing thing, though proven to be false many times before. Tbh, I don't see such a huge difference between traditional markets and crypto, especially because the same people (try to) manipulate it.
4178 2018-02-25 22:04:19 If mass adoption of a coin with limited supply and so much owners loosing and dying with their wallet access, is the risk the forever lost of too much #coin 'till the total disparition ? @SatoshiLite @CharlieShrem @NickSzabo4 @jgarzik @VinnyLingham @CryptoCobain @Crypto_God

4180 2018-02-25 22:03:52 Entonces como demócrata que dices ser, sigue la ley y consigue primero los apoyos mínimos.  Cuando tengáis la mayoría cualificada en el parlament, preparáis una propuesta y se lleva al congreso, entonces hablamos de referéndum. Mientras no seáis mayoría, no obliguéis al resto.
4181 2018-02-25 22:03:47 Anyone who loves #crypto should watch #Startup on Amazon Prime Video. Don't be put off by the seemingly constant gratuitous sex scenes used as filler in the 1st episode. It actually turns in to an awesome story.
4182 2018-02-25 22:03:38 True. But it hardly encourages the likes of me, the ordinary crypto follower with any sympathy when said thugs acts like idiots. Call the idiots out sure. I totally support that. . But don’t label us all as cryptocultists! :)
4183 2018-02-25 22:03:35 Endor...45m for 20% tokens...oy vey #crypto
4184 2018-02-25 22:03:31 Top 5 #crypto Bittrex buys (1h):

1. $BLOCK score: 8.4615
2. $EFL score: 6.1538
3. $RADS score: 3.8462
4. $1ST score: 3.8462
5. $GEO score: 3.0769
4185 2018-02-25 22:03:29 Because at this stage in #crypto a good % of new money comes in by means of @coinbase and they will psychologically purchase what is lowest...and that'll be $LTC coupled with shill of #LitePay will make it very enticing investment :)
4186 2018-02-25 22:03:17 What the point of comments like this? I’ve seen quite similar. Strictly for stirring shit up or am I ignorant to this?

4190 2018-02-25 22:02:55 Theta could be huge
4191 2018-02-25 22:02:50 Far be it from me to criticize ones style and tools. So many different options out there. I play very short term volatility moves in forex with strong success and use a diff style than crypto. Key is that it works for you to help you manage risk.
4192 2018-02-25 22:02:47 litecoin seems like the only solid crypto left. better off owning that than btc.

4199 2018-02-25 22:01:40 Unfortunately crypto is too easily manipulated for it to work without some sort of regulation. Too many greedy people out there taking advantage of an unregulated system.
4200 2018-02-25 22:01:31 Happy b-day @TheNickLeeson 

If you get to keep any of that b-day cash, might be a good time to stock up on some $Crypto

4202 2018-02-25 22:01:19 Also, 1) there are _plenty_ of other coins that are viable to mine on a GPU beyond Ethereum (ETC etc) and 2) if a miner has managed to mine an amount of ETH, they can stake it, increasing revenue when combined with their original GPUs now pointed at another coin. Win win.

4204 2018-02-25 22:01:08 Dejemos la discusión árida, enviar a alguien no significa que lleven propuestas y llevar propuestas ilegales no es válido. ¿Habéis aceptado renunciar a la independencia para encontrar otro encaje de CAT en España? ¿No? Entonces no estáis negociando, estáis amagando.

4210 2018-02-25 22:00:36 The attack is serious and practical at the crypto level from the first email - a collision is enough to cause a cryptographic hash function to be abandoned for sig/pow use. Any further evidence provided by @Ethan_Heilman was in good faith, but not needed. This is not pen testing.

4228 2018-02-25 21:58:49 I'm shocked that this crypto scam is part of just about every conversation thread I see on Twitter now. If the person is an influencer, the replies to their Tweets get inundated with phishing bots.

4256 2018-02-25 21:54:44 I believe the entire internet should be private. And with entire, I mean entire!
But for adoption of crypto, privacy could actually be a hindrance in the beginning. Because governments would be more willing to allow crypto if it's not totally private.

4268 2018-02-25 21:53:45 Absolutely. I ran out of characters. That said, the facts pundits get wrong about crypto are more tangible and easily exposed than for example in traditional finance with Federal Reserve voodoo and shill economists, or in politics where personal political bias clouds most minds.

4296 2018-02-25 21:50:56 Dicen q eso " es muy difícil". Pero en lugar de enviar a al Congreso diputados  a gente preparada y conciliadora, q convenciera a diputados, envían a Rufián. He ahí las ganas q tienen de "votar".

4306 2018-02-25 21:49:40 Well said, Patty Lo!  Ripple’s approach to make the current system more efficient will lead to the “flipping of the switch” to make the process more efficient and profitable.  This is a great change for banking.

4312 2018-02-25 21:48:38 Talking to a lot of friends and family (no coiners), the sentiment seems to be that crypto has crashed and not worth investing now... If that is an accurate representation of the masses, doesn't that mean we are ready to go up now?.. $btc $alts
4313 2018-02-25 21:48:38 Looks good, but looks the same as the last site. Is this coin trading anywhere yet, other than Barterdex? And what is the current price of BTCH?
4314 2018-02-25 21:48:33 Lumen attempting to moon now. I'm not suprised. Crypto is a cycle. The rest of the alts that floored will moon as well. Let's look for another coins:

I got into crypto Q3 of 2017, not that long but I'm learning, these bull runs and crashes are quite a wild ride but it teaches me not to panic too much

4334 2018-02-25 21:45:59 NP! I had to mention you guys some day. You taught me a lot and bring some positive vibes. 
4335 2018-02-25 21:45:55 lel.. Lots of sensitive holders on crypto. twitter. Was a half-joking question "Great", but it still stands.
4336 2018-02-25 21:45:49 Good call

4343 2018-02-25 21:43:58 Unfortunately decentralisation isn't working. When you create a system without regulation you end up with scammers, fraudsters, P&Ds and dev teams utilising their positions for self interests. My great optimism for crypto is fading away.

4359 2018-02-25 21:42:13 You know what sucks? The price of a 1070 graphics card skyrocketing because of Crypto. I WAS planning to build a new PC in the next couple months, but now I am just frustrated. 

Note: I don't have the money for a 1070 right now anyway if there was a ASAP solution.
4360 2018-02-25 21:41:22 WalletからSimplePosPoolにXPとB3coinを送り、マイニングを外で試すことにした。SimplePosPoolには結構な量のXPがプールされてるから、個人で100kXPが難しくてもマイニングで少しずつ増やせる！でもGOXのリスクもあるけど。

4362 2018-02-25 21:41:13 I do believe that #BCH will close the gap a bit over the year but think that #BTC will have to reach 40k+ for #BCH to hit that level, 80% of traders do not analyze all the data. To them its just a follow the leader thing.
4363 2018-02-25 21:41:07 Guys and girls this is time to be strong and i will promise you that who ever is holding strong and don’t lose faith will be rewarded in crypto and this is a promise because just look at all other times when the market have been like this.

4370 2018-02-25 21:40:18 Can you send me some Dollar, I am allin in Crypto, but I need some food...or you can send me a Pizza 
4371 2018-02-25 21:40:11 Bill you would make me happy if Google authenticator was not locking people's accounts because when you download on phone it say nothing about keys! then to top that there is no way of dealing with it as the auth team as they are unattainable? Don't you like crypto???
4372 2018-02-25 21:39:50 Can you hear that? It's the sound of crypto twitter dialing their Mom's asking if they can come back into the basement.
4373 2018-02-25 21:39:46 2k is too low, that's my sell-everything and buy price. Bottom will be more like 3000-4000k
4374 2018-02-25 21:39:45 Getting concerned by comments from economists that there will be a major downturn in the economy. To safeguard my future I'm telling my money market manager to put everything in Vibranium and have that backed up by Venezuelan crypto currency Petros.
4375 2018-02-25 21:39:30 no ETH? what the keh.
4376 2018-02-25 21:39:25 Pesados con votar.En CAT no hacemos otra cosa!! Y el 1O no era votar.Era una farsa q os montásteis para "legitimar" y justificar lo q realmente queríais: La unilateralidad!! Vostros no queréis votar,estaba todo preparado xa q los del NO no fuéramos, somos "malos catalanes".
4377 2018-02-25 21:39:24 I see this as a 'picks & shovels' investment. Big money is waiting to come in to crypto but there currently isn't the infrastructure in place to deal with it. Quoine hopes to address that with their World Book.
4378 2018-02-25 21:39:21 It still needs to cross the 200 MA on the 4H chart. That will be my buy signal.
4379 2018-02-25 21:39:16 Fuck i didnt know that you cant put crypto in OPskins and then cash out the money straight away. So i had to buy some shit, selling pink biker shades on OP right now. Please buy :)
4380 2018-02-25 21:39:15 @DiaryofaMadeMan what’s your thoughts on @STKtoken ? I have watched a few of your YouTube videos on them but was wondering what is your latest thought on them?
4381 2018-02-25 21:39:10 Trezorようやく到着。
Trezor bridgeのインストールの後，自動的にソフトが立ち上がって...と書かれていますがMacではうんともすんとも。

4382 2018-02-25 21:39:09 Funny how access to information lifts the veil of pundits.  Anyone with a basic understanding of crypto can see most talking heads don't know anything yet they comment authoritatively.  This likely means it will be easier than previously thought to disrupt the status quo.
4383 2018-02-25 21:39:09 Think about it some altcoin get to the final button and no more lower than that, fill up most you can because High probability that never be thet low again on nearly future.
4384 2018-02-25 21:39:07 Lol maybe you don’t want to use your best performing crypto to make payments with as that is those you want to HODL. Perhaps  it might be best to offload your worst performers.
4385 2018-02-25 21:39:05 Crypto
4386 2018-02-25 21:39:04 Can I pay you $1000 to make me $10000? Send me $9000 when you’re done...
4387 2018-02-25 21:39:00 Lol sorry. I guess I'm calling the increase in volume a pump.

4395 2018-02-25 21:37:18 One unique challenge in crypto vs other startups is learning when to build consensus and when to forge ahead with your own plans and just see who comes with.

The assessment you have to make is how much skin the potential collaborators are willing to put into the game themselves.
4396 2018-02-25 21:37:16 Crypto Business is now following me on #Twitter!

Welcome!
4397 2018-02-25 21:37:15 Profit is profit, 2 things Iv learned a lot lately is don’t get to greedy and never fomo! Chedz will never tell you what to do with your $ so don’t ask! Do what your comfortable with.. all I know is pullbacks can wipe your profits if you wait to long and get greedy. Just my $.02
4398 2018-02-25 21:37:15 You’re right on market cap, I was looking in wrong place, but as you said time will tell

4405 2018-02-25 21:35:39 I know ;) I had this situation when it droped to ~6k$. I was not afraid to loose, I knew it will recover. But it was so painful to see so low prices while I coudn’t buy anything, since I was out of cash :/ But it is not the case now :) So, I even prefer to see 3-5k$ for BTC... ;)

4409 2018-02-25 21:34:50 the academics of the intellectual dark-web should look to crypto-assets like bitcoin and other innovations as powerful tools at their disposal built by communities who value censorship resistance, openness, and the power of ideas
4410 2018-02-25 21:34:42  I’m good.

I like letting you think that everyone in crypto doesn’t understand the equity markets. Will make it more fun when the disruption occurs :)

4432 2018-02-25 21:30:51 Confidence is coming back slowly but steadily after the correction in January. Crypto is unpredictable, we could have it in 2 weeks or 2-3 months, I think April-May

4448 2018-02-25 21:29:35 It's no more of a conspiracy than food stamps.

The bank he works for does all kinds of shady shit.

4480 2018-02-25 21:25:28 The kinds of design choices made in IOTA qualify as 'amateur' errors objectively. A simple course in crypto would probably have prevented them, or someone with a crypto or security background vetting the design before launching.

4502 2018-02-25 21:22:58 First they try to appropriate the word “crypto”, and now they’re trying to redefine it to mean “the most cryptic design choices we could make in a currency”

4634 2018-02-25 21:06:39 LSK dropped 24 hours after rebrand but during the week before rebrand nearly hit ATH and 420 billion is not a dream market cap if it was at least 550-600 billion we would see 10$ ven already but still think it will hit around 10$ by Thursday evening Central European time
4635 2018-02-25 21:06:38 For some reason i see $STRAT as a dormant volcano. Once this explodes, there's no stopping it.
4636 2018-02-25 21:06:37 A lot of people still don’t see this crypto currency opportunity & it’s crazy but I know they all gonna look back at me & remeber when I told them about it in the NEAR future
4637 2018-02-25 21:06:06 The dude is a millionaire now, and it is actually NOW at all time highs in terms of LTC/BTC pair. I know no one probably trades it vs BTC, but still. Plus now he is free to post w/e the fuck he wants without getting shit for trying to "pump" LTC. LTC $500 end of 2019.

4640 2018-02-25 21:05:55 well let's see. in the last week, nano is up 111%...and climbing.

xrp down 25%. so that would be one reason. Hodl that XRP though.

Those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it.

The iconoclastic urge of crypto to dislodge the existing financial system combined with naivety and arrogance means no-one has bothered to understand why the system is as it is.

4761 2018-02-25 20:53:09 But its 2 week old news..
4762 2018-02-25 20:53:04 Agree with all but XMR. $150 tx fees will be too much.
4763 2018-02-25 20:52:57 Can't wait for $WAN to list. I wonder if it will dip after its first week on exchanges.
4764 2018-02-25 20:52:47 Do you see investors jumping on crypto towards the end of the cycle in a similar way we see gold price go up?
4765 2018-02-25 20:52:29 Thanks for making us aware of this scam. Would never invest in this.
4766 2018-02-25 20:52:27 They all have been scheming for some time now, Russia's move just makes them figure out their blockchain plan faster

4768 2018-02-25 20:52:11 It goes to 2k it may as well go to zero. Not going to happen
4769 2018-02-25 20:52:08 I'm glad that I work with such a strong and promising team. This company is waiting for a great future. #PECUNIO #Crypto #ICO
4770 2018-02-25 20:51:58 Easy to say like that ;)
So what's the "prediction" then ?
4771 2018-02-25 20:51:48 C
4772 2018-02-25 20:51:44 I got high hopes for $LEND and $WABI. Held $SUB since .26 all the way thru $3 and got tired of the BS and hopped off at $1 thinking about hopping back in. We’ll see  GLTA

4775 2018-02-25 20:51:01 Gold is not a bad hedge for crypto currency. Right now the premiums on high quality, pre 1933 gold coins is just about zero.
4776 2018-02-25 20:50:56 You guys lots of good news coming in crypto this week did you buy on the dip yesterday ?  It's never too late to get in just don't be the last in. Watch these prices rise this week #  Pay attention to the  Crypto market ♡  It could make you a fortune in a short amount of time if
4777 2018-02-25 20:50:51 You took the words right out of my mouth
4778 2018-02-25 20:50:47 OK for XMR and NEO

4781 2018-02-25 20:50:36 It could make a lot of sense for gaming companies where there is more of an overlap between crypto early adopters and their customers / potential investors. Especially if purchasing the security token gave you unique ERC721 items in game

4785 2018-02-25 20:50:05 Sells his coin... Then tweets how crypto currency is a bubble. WTF? I make money on lite... But have no longterm faith in holding it. Daytrade... Oh absolutely!  But the owner killed his own coin and it sits stagnant in his exiting cloud.
4786 2018-02-25 20:50:04 I seriously love you @SatoshiLite . The balance of your quietude and ferocity is admirable. You're no BS crypto policy is grade A. You're candor and what you stand for were undeniable factors in my decision to make LTC my first crpyto asset and the majority of my portfolio.

4790 2018-02-25 20:49:50 That crypto investor presentation 
4791 2018-02-25 20:49:21 I know mate, I honestly can't think of a crypto that makes this sort of revenue and is growing at such a rate as $MWAT and has a mcap of sub $30m. I've loaded up and I am excited for how this develops. Minimum risk too
4792 2018-02-25 20:49:15 No one should ever listen to him. The world would be a better place if I never saw him mentioned or taken seriously. The guy has absolutely no clue how crypto works technically or economically.
4793 2018-02-25 20:49:14 See his tweet 8 minutes prior for some context.
4794 2018-02-25 20:48:58 I enjoy all of your tweets Sarah.  Inspires me to invest more!!
4795 2018-02-25 20:48:55 Get a time machine, buy a lot of graphics card, sell them after the crypto-boom. ??? Profit
4796 2018-02-25 20:48:51 But c’mon, the c+l beside each other definitely looks like a “d” lol. At this point, anyone who falls for these kindergarten scams needs to learn a lesson. It’s a shame @Twitter can’t utilize any “high tech” intelligence to counter them
4797 2018-02-25 20:48:47 Cannot wait till #wanchain hits the exchanges so I can watch it die!!! If I could i would short TF out of it! #Crypto
4798 2018-02-25 20:48:46 I wouldn't call Senator Feinstein "Republican-lite," but she & I disagree on about as many issues as we agree on.
Expansion of the surveillance state being one of them (Patriot Act, PIPA, bills to block strong crypto, etc).
Also her support for weapons sales to Saudi Arabia...
4799 2018-02-25 20:48:45 $DNR about to release master nodes.  PoW/PoS coin with dark send.  People are sleeping on this privacy coin.
4800 2018-02-25 20:48:36 I hope they will. They have to. Just look like bittex not it used to now..
4801 2018-02-25 20:48:33 Nah it’s just extremely relevant with the amount of dumb ego posts flying around in crypto twitter
4802 2018-02-25 20:48:29 Others thought a $3 $LTC at the beginning of 2017 going to almost $400 was a joke before it happened the end of last year! Jokes do actually manifest in the wild crypto world! Hoping for a big #Litecoin joke in 2018!
4803 2018-02-25 20:48:26 Its really difficult. Its all about who is shorting. If people with "inside" knowledge are shorting then it will really go down..if people are just speculating then they may get killed. WE outsiders dont know who they are.
4804 2018-02-25 20:48:15 Perfect predicition!
Except bch but we will see 
4805 2018-02-25 20:48:12 Technically impressive, sure, but there are weaknesses in the tech that make it hard to be used in the things it wants to be used for. I admit that it's by no means easy to build a tangle-based ledger. But a tangle-based ledger has its problems.

4807 2018-02-25 20:47:33 Investing into Crypto is like investing into

Each had no sentimental value.
But based off of what was "promised"  in the future.

4829 2018-02-25 20:44:46 Been a $powr holder for a while. They’re the more established $wpr. Still super cheap.
4830 2018-02-25 20:44:42 If everyone is planning to cash out into fiat, then crypto will never get there. Think bigger picture. What if LTC continues to appreciate? Think about using SALT to get the cash you need to pay off loans.
4831 2018-02-25 20:44:32 Thanks a lot mate :)
4832 2018-02-25 20:44:31 I have been watching this for a couple weeks and it always seems opposite.

When shorts are high the price goes up and when shorts are low the price goes down.

I can't seem to figure out why that is.
4833 2018-02-25 20:44:28 yes
4834 2018-02-25 20:44:25 Where's wabi cabron?
4835 2018-02-25 20:44:17 If it bounces at $8900 - $9200 this week... $10855 is resistance... It won’t go to $18000... #bitcoin #crypto...

4837 2018-02-25 20:43:41 IMHO no. I think Litepay will have to prove itself to the crypto world before it gets back to ATH and beyond  in fact I see a dip first because ppl think the 26th is a magic day. Hang in there#Hodl #ltc #Litepay see ya at the Lunar Bar!
4838 2018-02-25 20:43:37 What do you think is in general are short increase and long increase good indicators for the price acting accordingly?
4839 2018-02-25 20:43:30 Looking forward to see the Crypto Merchant Bank opening in Vancouver later this year.
4840 2018-02-25 20:43:28 This is stupid..  u guys are going to put us in 2 years bear market...ltc.and btc needs to work together with hotswap and lightning and concentrate on mass adoption.  Think about the pairing.   This will only show crypto to be unstable
4841 2018-02-25 20:42:57 What do you guys think it will take to push this market to lets say a 6 trillion dollar marketcap?
4842 2018-02-25 20:42:34 let's make a series in @netflix about the entire history of crypto .....

4844 2018-02-25 20:42:19 There are cracks in the US economy showing up. USD has been enjoyed safe haven status during recessions in past 20 years. If economic crisis hits, my guess is crypto too new for safe haven status... will act as a risk asset and decline with others. Will be monitoring.
4845 2018-02-25 20:42:15 A lot of time going to waste on Coinbase, eh? Too bad, cause $MCD stays illiquid meanwhile
4846 2018-02-25 20:42:13 I really hope these end of year predictions are true because losing money is no fun, and i already picked a color for my lambo. I feel like in order to hit these numbers we need a multi trillion dollar market, and we're struggling to get to past 500 billion.

4851 2018-02-25 20:41:58 Additionally all u people saying all of crypto is overvalued. It's a GLOBAL market. If it's overvalued, but yet u believe in mass adoption, that would make most current projects undervalued ffs. Not overvalued. $1T cap puts us where on these projects? Use your heads
4852 2018-02-25 20:41:51 I think the contention here would be the speed of forking, not coordination vs. defection

In the time it took Protestantism to get going, quantum computers would have already rendered crypto void

4864 2018-02-25 20:40:26 I found the Austere article confusing and unclear. There is nothing I hate more than seeing someone criticise without offering a more compelling alternative. Burniske’s approach remains the most well-explained and reasonable approach to crypto valuation I’ve encountered.
4865 2018-02-25 20:40:16 When other people ask you:

You can answer: “It doesn’t matter who, because TBC is a true crypto-currency and it’s completely decentralized.

4877 2018-02-25 20:38:56 I've been wondering if network analysis (Metcalf's law, Zipf's law) could help. Seems a bit simplistic to plug estimated user growth into v=n^2 but given crypto networks enable the direct monetisation of network effects, maybe worth a thought.

2. Invest the same amount in those coins and HODL

4907 2018-02-25 20:36:12 Tech is half the story with these things. Past a certain level a product either works or it doesn’t. It’s the race to build the community then.
4908 2018-02-25 20:35:54 Your last two months of Twitter are the average last minute crypto investor experience, you understood everything about bitcoin, keep on going...
4909 2018-02-25 20:35:49 You do not like #SC ?
4910 2018-02-25 20:35:49 The next few weeks are going to be pretty exciting in the cryptosphere. Lots of new ICOs and projects taking off. Lets see who'll stand on top.

#BTC #ETH #LTC #Crypto #Cryptocurrency
4911 2018-02-25 20:35:31 Ben bir kişiden değil, gördüğüm durumlardan bahsettim. Böyle insanlar var, aklınızı kullanın, herkese kanmayın dedim. Konu buraya nasıl geldi anlamış değilim.
4912 2018-02-25 20:35:17 30k-50k is the ticket. However hitting that range would intrigue even the most skeptical of crypto doubters in investing and media, triggering the mass adoption phase where the climb to 100k for BTC begins. Along with the narrowing of the BTC LTC gap.

4917 2018-02-25 20:34:24 Good! Tippers and faucets are a great, tangible way to introduce new people to crypto
4918 2018-02-25 20:34:17 Any thoughts on @NeblioTeam ? Thanks
4919 2018-02-25 20:34:11 what about $xvg?
4920 2018-02-25 20:33:58 I generally feel existing companies entering crypto through an ICO are doing it as a money grab. If someone enters the market with a brand new product in my opinion is a better choice. Sure, there are exceptions - like Fogcoin which is one of the ICOs I rated well.
4921 2018-02-25 20:33:54 One can just admire them, so much commitment! That's what investors want! In for the long run! Whiles some chinese Justin copy cats whitepapers and scams ppl as biggest holder w/ no product (XRP anyone?) and this is accepted? Going beyond and try something new is not. crypto...
4922 2018-02-25 20:33:51 No XVG on that list?
4923 2018-02-25 20:33:49 
4924 2018-02-25 20:33:48 Emphatically: Don't put all your eggs in the crypto basket. I think bitcoin will stick around. Not sure about XMR. (But hoping)
4925 2018-02-25 20:33:37 Crypto is getting crushed in the gut, but otherwise it's business as usual.  Time for a vacation in the tropics: palm trees, rum, and bikinis.  

See you when the shitshow is over.

4938 2018-02-25 20:31:57 @BigCheds has the best free learning resources I have seen on twitter.  His contribution is incredible. 

I still pick up a little something new on crypto from him on something I didn’t see or wasn’t even looking for.

4954 2018-02-25 20:30:44 Is that from the Ameno video?
4955 2018-02-25 20:30:27 By making that statement, you essentially are slamming the ENTIRE crypto market. Additionally,  the deeper I look into Tron, the more actual value and future use case I see over 99% of current projects.
4956 2018-02-25 20:30:26 @Toine_Gotti going to research these
4957 2018-02-25 20:30:13 What about NXS?
4958 2018-02-25 20:30:03 @ParetoNetwork -> Platform
4959 2018-02-25 20:29:58 so you're not invested in crypto?

4961 2018-02-25 20:29:45 should surely look at $fct. Big play with mortgage and banks plus one of the few cryptos with a working product. Furthermore, a draper investment ;)

4985 2018-02-25 20:27:00 #SegWit is the process by which the block  size limit on a blockchain is increased by removing signature data from  Bitcoin transactions. When certain parts of a transaction are removed,  this frees up space or capacity to add more transactions to the chain
4986 2018-02-25 20:26:50 [3] I’m monitoring the $GBYTE price closely, via alerts on Delta and I’ll be looking to trade out when it pumps back to around $900. I’m still looking into what I’ll trade into next, I’m leaning towards going back into $NANO as I think it’ll pump past ATH soon. #crypto #1000x
4987 2018-02-25 20:26:45 @BigCheds BCPT and ICX seem to have potential. Thanks for teaching others. I entered the crypto space at 64 and it it was and still is, quite a challenge. But I am making progress thanks to your valuable inset.

4991 2018-02-25 20:26:29 Governments have started the race for crypto adoption. The government that fully accepts crypto will have first mover advantage to lead the charge in new tech development and advancing their economies. Future children not use paper money.
4992 2018-02-25 20:26:21 [2] I monitored the $NANO pump carefully on the 24th Feb and traded out when it reached ~$18.45. I traded into $GBYTE (0.14047874 bag) which was also down significantly (~$545.77) from its ATH. At the time this has my portfolio worth $75.50. #crypto #1000x
4993 2018-02-25 20:26:18 You are mistaken. @crypto_bobby was never a Bitconnect supporter.

4998 2018-02-25 20:25:44 If you ask me it is the trading/investing mindset that makes the whole #PayWithLitecoin and #PayWithCrypto concept more of a dream and not a reality since it causes the IRS look for Capital Gains Tax when we use crypto for purchases.
4999 2018-02-25 20:25:44 [1] On 21st Feb I purchased 4.10804392 $XRB/$NANO at $9.82207478 (fee +$1.21) for a total of $41.56. $NANO was down massively following the recent hack, on top of the already heavily bear market. #Crypto #1000x
5000 2018-02-25 20:25:38 They are all banning it now, the BIG banks here in the UK have done the same! Not all of them just a few but am sure it will not be long before many others do! This is not good for Crypto!

5023 2018-02-25 20:22:13 ICX, EOS, XMR, VEN, NEO, BTC, LALA World, NAS and ETH.
5024 2018-02-25 20:21:59 $QASH is going to be a monster. People are shortsighted but that has top 10 potential within a couple of years
5025 2018-02-25 20:21:58 Faster than bitcoin? Yea. But it’s not faster than litecoin in my experience. Both have low enough fees imo, LTC ftw
5026 2018-02-25 20:21:46 2017 was IMO a once in a lifetime growth phase for crypto, where $LTC did 100x. As much as I'd like to see that happen again, I think we'd be fortunate to see 10x from lows this year. Hope I'm wrong!

5046 2018-02-25 20:20:26 Just a symptom of what's coming to crypto commentary. Keynesians (who argued w/ this model for years) will not like the use of it. Some will trounce anything crypto/blockchain related. I'd say, these folks had a solid point or 2, but on a whole, agree with your take. Ill DM you.
5047 2018-02-25 20:20:12 2. Especially as the crypto mkts come out of the bears. Imho I would want to seem them strengthen and unlock when the mkt senses a strong demand. It will encourage trust in the project. But certainly it will be unlocked.

5049 2018-02-25 20:19:31 Even i was targeted the other day! Full on copy of my profile trying to scam people. Not sure why I only have around 220 followers but they still tried! Ba****ds!!!!
5050 2018-02-25 20:19:13 I'm all in Litecoin Queen! 
5051 2018-02-25 20:19:05 The reason why @CNBCFastMoney is laughable with reporting crypto is they only look at the price, and not the technology. ENRON had a pretty good stock price 18 years ago. BCASH is going to be phased out very soon in the crypto world.
5052 2018-02-25 20:19:05 Yeah, I think it's making people anxious about buying into AION as they feel like they've already missed out. 

I think @CryptoGat has some good info on AION, check him out.

5056 2018-02-25 20:18:39 Anybody want to do the math on that? A circulating supply of 55 million coins at 10k a piece comes to what market cap? I’d love for that to happen, because it would mean crypto as a whole would have had an INCREDIBLE year, but it’s impossible. Not going to happen. Not even close
5057 2018-02-25 20:18:37 Yes sir. I am still a child.

5078 2018-02-25 20:16:11 yep just double checked. FDIC insured up to 250k on the fiat. The crypto is not covered so they still run the same risk as any other exchange
5079 2018-02-25 20:16:08 And lower sell volume
5080 2018-02-25 20:16:07 can use any crypto but does have restrictions i dont need an unlimited number of base coin as we nned to know whats out at all times to match with pool . to cover the crypto 100% by USD

5100 2018-02-25 20:13:58 It definitely will. Regulation always plays catch up to innovation and in the case of crypto currencies it's just a matter of time.
5101 2018-02-25 20:13:48 It should be alot higher, alot of people now know what crypto-currency is now in the UK, BUT people soon think its a scam not knowing anything about it. Its an automatic assumption that could make you £££ if you times it well!

Narrow minded people are the ones that FOMO ATH and sell at the dip. Then they post "you said to do this or that"
5129 2018-02-25 20:11:01 Impractical ya i think so , there shouldent be nation specific cryptos . But if what your getting at is , could each nation have there own crypto that they use instead or to replace conventional money . Well the governments could pick one and say use this only.  But would they ?

5229 2018-02-25 20:02:30 I would certainly pay for recommendations about secure operating protocol "on-boarding" directions, and scam warnings from McAfee. There's never been an HIGHLY-DETAILED set of opsec+crypto instructions for interacting w/bitcoin, securing savings,& sending coin to wallet.
5230 2018-02-25 20:02:20 party time!
5231 2018-02-25 20:02:19 Glad you like it 
5232 2018-02-25 20:02:19 Apart from bitcoin,kindly advise me on other crypto to invest on.I believe in your forecasting,its works perfectly well.
5233 2018-02-25 20:02:10 Yes but there are lots of news by now, AMA from IOTA concerning the COO etc. Wallet, IXI hub, fast IRI, it may makes it a good bet by now for the future and adoption also due to new partners like VW happening soon, also Oyster Pearl etc strengthen the tangle. Opinions on that?
5234 2018-02-25 20:02:03 I guess it doesn't matter in the current world of crypto trading. You wouldn't get a job in Wall Street. But crypto is transferring wealth, from traditional hedge funds etc. to, well, just ordinary people. At some point this will change, but for now, it is an interesting time.

5240 2018-02-25 20:01:48 Also keep in mind that IOTA's network can operate without using a single unit of its native currency. If IOTA is a good IOT tech, there's still no reason its native currency should be valuable...

5339 2018-02-25 19:53:50 I've found a brand new game that dropped like fire bro. 
Shilling it hard now. Interested? =D
5340 2018-02-25 19:53:48 He's using XRP/USDT pair, which IMHO is kind of dumb. Most, if not all, use XRP/BTC pair. But hey, what do I know #JustSaying
5341 2018-02-25 19:53:45 Thoughts on Sia Coin?
5342 2018-02-25 19:53:39 Making you dont forget it daily lol

5344 2018-02-25 19:53:25 #Tron has a very strong future.  All these people who want to get rich overnight will sell quick and miss out on the long term gains.  #TRX has a solid 10 years before reaching full potential.
5345 2018-02-25 19:53:24 LSK and ZEN? I would add those
5346 2018-02-25 19:53:16 I have a former roommate whose car got a ton of tickets that he holds me responsible for. He paid them off and is making me pay them back. He's made millions off of crypto, but never fails to bug me (I make $15 an hour) for a monthly payment.

5361 2018-02-25 19:51:53 Question Crypto Core. Big fan of yours here, but my question is this. If for some reason, lets say crypto just dissapeared tommorrow and went to zero. You are a day trader right?
What market would you move to if Cryptocurrencies crashed?
5362 2018-02-25 19:51:51 That’s me mate. Lucked out all these years and still rolling doubles
5363 2018-02-25 19:51:22 I'm pretty sure that was to make an announcement about potential support with binanace for a btcp wallet post fork. Doubt that would cause an exchange to get mad and not support a fork. Plenty of coins/forks are supported on multiple wallets/exchanges
5364 2018-02-25 19:51:19 I am worrying about $zcl now. Bittrex like a ghost city. A company no body working in it. Not sure but could be not support this fork. Candles now looking bad. I hope i will be wrong :( $btc

5381 2018-02-25 19:50:05 Tip to get rid of spam on crypto searches in feed... add " -filter:links" after coin name. Examples below. You're welcome.

5398 2018-02-25 19:49:27 hi crypto boi
5399 2018-02-25 19:49:23 No. You're assuming other market participant's goals and methods. When I see a strong sell-off coming I go completely flat (no crypto exposure). You'll gain as much wealth during a vertical sell-off as you will on a parabolic blow-off top.
5400 2018-02-25 19:49:13 State sponsored crypto can never work. It is not trustless or decentralized. It will never get mass adoption or have the@level of security bitcoin has.
5401 2018-02-25 19:48:59 Claro las referencias personales directas de la gente que lo sufrió,no sirven. Solo lo que diga Cucurull y sus acólitos. Mira la verdad es la verdad, la diga Agamenón o su porquero. Fue un asesino genocida.

5430 2018-02-25 19:46:26 But maybe you have 70% of all the answears and you never know, because you always downplayed your importance to 50%. It distorts your view. In leadership it also leads to the belief among your followers that you do have as less importance as you show them. Depends on the people.

5436 2018-02-25 19:46:00 PoW dominance will be nearly impossible for a chain based on anything other than SHA-256. Now that nation states are aware of crypto they have no reason to let new PoW schemes to take hold. Bitcoin flew under the radar, but a new scheme won't have the luxury

5481 2018-02-25 19:41:15 thank mate! 55/45 LTC would probably be a good move..not too much hassle for the #hodl 
5482 2018-02-25 19:41:14 I don’t understand you guys at all. Be about something stop trying to finesse the community no duh blockchain is here to stay.Stop saying bitcoin can goto $900 for the 3rd time. Fiat is the biggest scam of all time. This is the digital finance era #DealWithIt!
5483 2018-02-25 19:41:14 I'll try. A platform where developers (businesses) deploy requests for real-time information and users provide that information in exchange for crypto. In essence, crowdsourcing the truth.
5484 2018-02-25 19:41:05 Merci Bitcoin d'avoir mit cette technologie en avant :)
5485 2018-02-25 19:40:50 As a person getting in at December 2017, I kinda hope we do haha
5486 2018-02-25 19:40:49 1 satoshi will be equal to 1 cent in the near future.1 btc will be fixed at 1 million dollars.After that we will be able to use satoshi for shopping.

5487 2018-02-25 19:40:48 Hi @CryptoLady94 
How was your weekend, managed to stay away from computer a bit more?
Where are you from, I mean, you are probably from heaven, but where do you live now?
5488 2018-02-25 19:40:33 Crypto is eating the world. Welcome!

5494 2018-02-25 19:39:36 We’ll take bitconnect only if we really wanted to go broke... I’ll bring up crypto payments to devs, but it’s unlikely at this point, we have a lot of other things to handle as priority

5496 2018-02-25 19:38:58 Tangle is such a messy and unwieldy data structure. Network needs a shit ton of transactions to be secure, and I don't even know how secure it would be if a full node decided to be a bad actor. No incentive for full nodes to be good actors.

5513 2018-02-25 19:36:14 Hello again! I recently download IQ OPTION app and I think you're able to sell crypto and leave your money in deposits.
5514 2018-02-25 19:36:13 Somehow pizza feels like the ultimate validation for crypto adoption.

5515 2018-02-25 19:36:13 I dunno. Maybe I should quit my job, go full crypto, move to Portland & blog/tweet about the coming new world disorder because *this time* it's different. Seems rational.

5577 2018-02-25 19:29:36 I don’t follow anyone who promotes that argument so I’ve not heard it often.  Though, if you’ve run into it often this doesn’t surprise me.  There are many diff “ultimate solution” opinions in crypto. LN is great example, it’s a fascinating protocol but it doesn’t “solve” scaling
5578 2018-02-25 19:29:33 Trump for example. Besides him beeing an unqualified individual as president thats not the only reason most of the world and even his close circle don’t respect him. He is the exact opposite of a humble man.
5579 2018-02-25 19:29:29 I'm guessing either..  They like him and want to vote him in for a third term rather than having to choose somebody new they don't like.  This guys plan is supposed to take atleast another terms worth of time.
Or ppl don't like it and it makes the need for crypto that much more
5580 2018-02-25 19:29:20 My first was dgb too. Bought at 200, saw it going to 2000 something and eventually sold at 1200. Shame on me. I was so young in crypto years.

5610 2018-02-25 19:25:49 The fundamental thing crypto has yet to figure out is that there are a two sides to a deal. All crypto is centred on the needs of the issuer, forgetting that perhaps investors shouldn't be treated like chumps. 

I don't know why no one has figured this out.

5623 2018-02-25 19:24:34 Rand, have you see it? Quite possibly one of the worst I have ever seen.
5624 2018-02-25 19:24:31 I'm curious how many of the "girls" in crypto are actual girls lol
5625 2018-02-25 19:24:16 CRYPTO BOI
5626 2018-02-25 19:24:13 That's perfect !

5629 2018-02-25 19:23:42 Also lines up pretty nicely with 200MA
5630 2018-02-25 19:23:42 But he’s right about #crypto!!
5631 2018-02-25 19:23:33 Every system participant will need to have an account in the Ethereum blockchain and account in #Lympo platform. The Ethereum account’s public key will be linked to the #Lympo account in order to collect #Lympo tokens, participate in reward programs or other smart contracts.
5632 2018-02-25 19:23:28 Honestly I think 10-12K is the channel for 2018 before next wave of new Money comes in with positive crypto news. Which could be in next 4-12 months . I’m buying everything that starts w 8 or 9
5633 2018-02-25 19:23:22 Yet, it's good to challenge current situation with opposing and radical ideas. Bitcoin needs to evolve to hold its status as king of crypto, and no evolving happens if ideas, even the radical ones, are not discussed.
5634 2018-02-25 19:23:11 You wouldn't happen to know if Vero has or is planning to have its own crypto token do you?
5635 2018-02-25 19:23:04 I think we need an announcement tonight. Step to the plate guys and be relevant.

5644 2018-02-25 19:21:32 You can learn by existing. Humility teaches others how to be equal and anti prejudice. Has nothing to do with envy in fact should epitomize hope, love, and wellbeing toward others. It also protects against judgment from the almighty!

5689 2018-02-25 19:17:21 Given most public exchanges have significant institutional investor groups that's a whole lot of money you won't find on crypto exchanges. Missy of those institutions are backed by pension funds... Which is money from all sorts of folks.
5690 2018-02-25 19:17:06 It should be like this... Rumor the news, buy the sells.

5694 2018-02-25 19:15:58 Tune into the show tomorrow morning. We are going to go into the slow motion crypto train wreck that is the Venezuelan Petro $PTR.

It's basically what an ICO would look like if it was put together by a 10 year old with a learning disability.

It's hilarious & tragic all at once.
5695 2018-02-25 19:15:52 Good hint about timing, thanks!
It should be fairly easy to spot bots with machine learning algorithm, because they are trying to post as fast as it possible to get the exposure.
Or we can just add warning sign to all replies with crypto address and were done within first 5 mins.

5697 2018-02-25 19:15:48 This isn’t “crypto” but rather a share in a company that only accredited investors (in US at least) can trade. Global, free market will put new premiums are real assets which will lead to much higher valuations
5698 2018-02-25 19:15:40 Since literally 99.9% of crypto traders don't report their profits to the IRS, this should be just lovely news to the recipients: "Bitcoin Slides As Coinbase Informs 13,000 Customers Of Imminent Data Handover To IRS" (ZH)

5700 2018-02-25 19:14:59 3/ Avoids manipulation by banks. Well the first part of this, I'd say the US markets aren't the entirety of global stock markets. Shocking I realise.

As for manipulation? Jeez man, have you even taken a cursory glance at crypto markets? It's the 1920s all over again.

Don't try to trick us here plz u just have too many facts there already
5703 2018-02-25 19:14:30 My prediction... #Litecoin displaces #BCash as daily use-case crypto. Mass retailer adoption and mass embrace by world travelers (no foreign xchange fees), remittance payments and HODLERS (digital gold). This is getting VERY interesting...
5704 2018-02-25 19:14:17 The reason for our #ICO is to convey to you a framework through which you can trade private computerized resources or records with positively no impedance from any outsider, not even a chairman. #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain

5706 2018-02-25 19:13:49 Bitcoin Cash is a response to the wrong direction BTC is taking.  If BCH did not exist, we would have no choice but to abandon Bitcoin since BTC discourages growth.  As soon as transaction rate picks up, you can look forward to the $20 fees we just had.

5715 2018-02-25 19:12:56 This is the problem with a rogue few running @bitcoin who call #BitcoinCash #bitcoin if they hadn't included the three letters #btc in that article we wouldn't have known who had crypto this person owned. Wishing him justice and a quick recovery.
5716 2018-02-25 19:12:51 3/ Higher valuations? Given most crypto is traded in the total absence of data and driven by FOMO, maybe yeah, they could get higher valuations, but who trades your stock is often just as important as what they pay for it. Retail investors aren't the top of that tree.
5717 2018-02-25 19:12:44 And crypto 
5718 2018-02-25 19:12:33 Buy "worthless" crypto. Waste 460BIL of the money of their customers. Thats suicide.

5728 2018-02-25 19:11:55 How did I start in crypto basically?

Well, I had a ton invested in #dgb --> the hype back then. Following it more or less, not checking what it could do.

Do remember a day back then with +8000% and more for coins. Didn't sell. Then the drop down came --> and I started learning.

5733 2018-02-25 19:11:05 2/ The investor base of public markets are far larger in reality than crypto, with far more money to trade. If you're saying crypto cash theoretically be bigger, well, so can public markets. Bigger markets, more access, more capital to trade.
5734 2018-02-25 19:10:44 I can not agree with first.
Second maybe.
5735 2018-02-25 19:10:38 Those 200+ followers were probably fed up of Asian & panda hitting jokes

5737 2018-02-25 19:10:04 Look at the guys behind this shit site. This whole crypto market is infested with noobs, morons, mooners and 400000 trilliin shit coins,scams, and forks without real world usage. A look on crypto twitter says it all. No wonder, this "market" is in decline since 2018.

5745 2018-02-25 19:09:20 1/ Firstly, to state that public markets are not free markets is a bit... Strange. Public markets are far freer than crypto market in that literally *anyone* can access them to trade.

5768 2018-02-25 19:04:01 [Forwarded from Jonel] Our chain consensus is a blockchain of blockchains so we don't need a mainnet. Think Windows for Blockchain. We don't need our own token right now. We're currency agnostic so for adoption purposes we choose ERC20 token. We may do our own token in the future
5769 2018-02-25 19:03:48 Recently I burnt myself trying crypto currency. I learnt a valuable lesson. You cannot trade against the market rather you trade with the market. You study the market trends and position yourself for profit. I allow my emotions to get a better part of me.

Thoughts on ltc forming this symmetrical triangle and litepay release tomorrow?
5777 2018-02-25 19:03:13 There are 3 possibilities for Crypto:
It has reached its "bubble" peak and will decline into obscurity.
It is retracing from a historic bull move before the next leg up (perhaps bigger decline than you expect).
It will move sideways in a range forever.
Choose.

5853 2018-02-25 18:52:50 In order to compete in the new paradigm of digital capitalism and crypto finance, we must re-invest in the latest technologies (both hardware & software). No longer is it “OK” to operate on an antiquated tech stack. You’ll simply get left behind.

5895 2018-02-25 18:48:14 Regarding ICOs: There must be a clear distinction between tokens that are backed by equity and tokens that are not. Investors should NOT expect ROI for the latter. These tokens should never have been categorized as "investments".

6064 2018-02-25 18:29:19 Venezuela has a corrupt government, and a crypto currency that is backed by oil, with no information provided on how you obtain this oil physically. Nicolas Maduro is a dictator, and investing in dictators who restrict food to their citizens is bad business, and a bad investment.

6078 2018-02-25 18:26:46 This things you’ll make is probably not for me, but let me just say that while you gave a very good explanation of the price of bitcoin, you and yours are way too harsh on it from what I’ve seen. Crypto isn’t a “never invest” asset. It IS a “only invest what you can lose” asset.

6086 2018-02-25 18:25:19 It's not like that has been non-contentious, going back over the last 2,000 years.  I don't think the "fork" metaphor works very well to describe historical religious change either (tho "crypto" has an unironic pseudo-religious component for some people).

6109 2018-02-25 18:22:15 tbh tho I was mainly buying eth to trade for alts and it's right back where it was so I didn't get THAT rekt... until I fomo all in on xvg new years and lost half my shit holding onto it thinking it would come back. had to get a hard lesson from @kingbtc (who has me blocked now)

6120 2018-02-25 18:20:38 Agreed on both... LEND will pioneer lending in crypto. I’m excited about what 2018 brings... this crash/correction was an golden opportunity to load up.
6121 2018-02-25 18:20:34 The way we know crypto know will be completely different 1 year further on the road. I think to cover every sector you can minimalize your risk. As many coins focused on payment solutions. Trackable transport might be a big winner in 2018
6122 2018-02-25 18:20:32 PSA: Don't send cryptocurrency to anyone on twitter.  It's all scams.  Scammers impersonate people like myself and ask for crypto.  Report and block anyone who does this.

6135 2018-02-25 18:18:59 Nope, duh. Behind this account is a little overweighted 30 year old, bold man, most likely 
6136 2018-02-25 18:18:58 Agreed. Never use a known email address/social network address.  Also the increased risk of physical security is a threat.  Plausible deniability on hardware wallets is an option for those high risk.  Helpful against rubber-hose attacks.
6137 2018-02-25 18:18:58 55b of #XRP is in escrow. It won't be released entirely until 2022. It's more decentralized than most of other cryptocurrencies. The same about DYOR applies to you. Just don't cite Google search.
6138 2018-02-25 18:18:55 this crypto currency thing is tempting but ion trust it.
6139 2018-02-25 18:18:48 $zcl whale has resurfaced, and all I think about is where my $zcl will be while I wait for my $btcp? @BittrexExchange, or wallet? Lots of speculation for some announcement tmrw 26th, which would make sense 2 days before snapshot. But #crypto seldom makes sense. And so we wait

6227 2018-02-25 18:08:13 It was the doctrine of Positive Christianity and had roots in early 20th century German theorists. Paul made the original anti-Jewish Aryan faith of Jesus into a crypto-Judaism that evolved into Catholicism. The only truth is that he changed it, and had complex motives.

6338 2018-02-25 17:55:07 Crypto?
6339 2018-02-25 17:55:06 Hodling Iota in a crypto portfolio is alot like holding gold in a traditional portfolio. It is a safe haven-esque asset against the biggest threats to Crypto(quantum computing and scalability). The difference being that Gold is a leap backwards and Iota a speculative leap fwd.

6341 2018-02-25 17:54:43 Haha exactly. Though I can’t deny I put some on a card myself when I first started getting into crypto but it was not very much and I completely understand the risk I took. I didn’t max it and say I’ll pay it all back tmrw cuz moon sir or anything. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!

6349 2018-02-25 17:53:49 Have you tried bitshares?, its pretty good, the only improvement I can see is stop-limit orders, and better liquidity, but that just needs more users. You can also put up your bitshares on collateral, and borrow bitusd to buy more crypto.

6351 2018-02-25 17:53:43 I have an idea.  Let's build a green crypto coin, maybe just fork some work others initiated. A green coin. No mining needed. All participants get an equal share. And 75% coins are given away for free. Just like bitcoin a max number of coins to be made. When adopted. It's green.
6352 2018-02-25 17:53:34 @BankofAmerica announces that they are not sure if they can keep up with the rapid dev of Blockchain without significant expense then immediately bans buying crypto. Hypocrisy at its finest.
6353 2018-02-25 17:53:34 The current $BTC seems “fair” to me.  It is hard to be upset about dips when they are just temporary.  Take a breath. Buy, HODL, or relax, right?
#crypto #HODL
6354 2018-02-25 17:53:32 Not bold at all. Anyone who is competent in crypto currency would know this is bound to happen. We all know how overvalued BCH is right now. It makes ZERO sense to be valued where it is. We also all know how UNDERvalued LTC.

6368 2018-02-25 17:52:33 Bitcoin is hard to trace, not untraceable. And as far as credit cards and money laundering goes, I can take a cash advance and make that money disappear.

It is the big bank credit card companies that are banning BTC purchase. The thought of FIAT turning into Crypto scares them.

6374 2018-02-25 17:52:04 This a great comment. I agree! I think crypto in the long term will double every 3 or 4 months for this reason. I think bitcoin will break past 1 mil pre hyperinflation and then as the $ crashes we will see some crazy numbers pior to Bitcoin being the base currency of our solar

6397 2018-02-25 17:48:29 BTC will always be the face of crypto. There's so much money behind it that improvements will be made i.e. lightning network, and it'll get back to being used as a currency and not a store of value. Once that happens it will dominate transactions.

6405 2018-02-25 17:47:26 Market participants that refuse to recognize the benefits of a short should read some books. 
When your entire crypto portfolio is tied to BTC values, and BTC is declining, your best option to protect your equity is to open a short position. Think of it as hedging.

6446 2018-02-25 17:40:25 The "aligned incentive structures" of these projects is a shared fiction we keep telling ourselves. Maybe with enough repetition it will prove true at some point.  But as we're fond of quoting in the crypto space "history doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes".

6475 2018-02-25 17:35:50 I love seeing this. Experiencing this first hand, it’s been a humbling experience. Started investing on the first of this year, made my dumb mistakes, and learned from them. Just sticking to research for now and patiently waiting

6483 2018-02-25 17:34:48 Yet another concept you would fail to understand.
6484 2018-02-25 17:34:40 No, that applies to every crypto-engineer I know. Which would include all major cryptocurrencies (I hope!) except IOTA, and all of Silicon Valley too.
6485 2018-02-25 17:34:37 With $BTC fees so low and scaling development coming so fast, the primary feature of altcoins is disappearing.

In the current fee climate, why would anyone transact with an alt over real bitcoin?

6501 2018-02-25 17:32:45 If $BTC goes sideways...Alts will do well
If $BTC has a stall or temp drop, then Alts will get overflow and people moving to Alts for a short period.
If $btc rises slowly then alts go up fast.
If in bear or downtrent and $btc drops 3%, alts will drop 9%

Basic shit guys...

6514 2018-02-25 17:31:17 My guess is lower and lower responses to the moves. So less volatility, reduced volume like you mention, and prolonged bear trend. Could be other indicators too like crypto Twitter dying (hurts just as bad as btc dump imo)

6523 2018-02-25 17:29:55 I think average production cost of BTC is above 2000$ . It will die below it . What I mean is you will never going to see below average production cost
6524 2018-02-25 17:29:47 You say life isnt black or white but this whole thread is because of a tweet where you pigeon hole the idea of humility as being an inherently negative attribute
6525 2018-02-25 17:29:42 Hey Don,

I just don't know why they'd do that and scare so many people off crypto, probably for good. They'd make more money in the medium term by having healthier alt cycles were some people made $ and would then keep coming back?

6529 2018-02-25 17:29:12 The fact that Bitcoin has proven to stand up as a real currency, means that all crypto-currencies can also stand up as a real currencies too.  Bitcoin, the first crypto-currency, has pioneered the path for all crypto-currencies.

Where are you from ?
6536 2018-02-25 17:28:07 If it follows Bitcoin I call it an altcoin, probably not correct but that’s the way I see it. Wish it wasn’t so though then we would have many more opportunities to ‘play’ the crypto market
6537 2018-02-25 17:28:04 True, putting money into crypto currency is a gamble not an investment. It may go up down or to zero. If you can’t afford to lose all the money you should not buy it
6538 2018-02-25 17:27:46 I'm not a fanboy of any crypto currency. A fanboy of the whole crypto movement for sure. And as a side node: a want to take as much profit out of it as possible. That's why I follow the trends. Ethereum has the lead since many weeks. Go with the flow. BTC is back in late spring
6539 2018-02-25 17:27:44 @crypto_grower Are you supplying sell signals as well or is there an adjustment to make, in order to operate it completely passive?

Who benefits from a Crypto-currency that is traded on an “Exchange?”  

The people that own the “Exchange” is the correct answer!

6626 2018-02-25 17:16:58 @hmblank hallo ik luister met veel plezier naar jullie cryptocast probeer ook kritische gasten uit te nodigen, goed voor de nuance heb een vraag: wat vinden jullie van het kopen of verkopen van crypto via brokers zoals etoro of andere, lijkt makkelijker dan via Exchanges
6627 2018-02-25 17:16:48 It is being pushed down. The old system lost over $2 Trillion a couple of weeks ago the world over. Someone does not want any of that money to fall into Crypto.
6628 2018-02-25 17:16:37 New crypto money hasn’t seen a real pump yet. You’ll know cause you’ll cry afterwards
6629 2018-02-25 17:16:31 There is some issues with the windows firewall..
6630 2018-02-25 17:16:26 No. No one remembers anything.
6631 2018-02-25 17:16:08 I’d do some stupid shit to attain as much btc at that price
6632 2018-02-25 17:16:02 Once BTC . BTC  yakın destekleri kırarsa USD. 4-5 K arası alış emri. Kesin rakamlar için acele etmeyin. Grafik ler havalarda uçuşacak zaten. Tek kaynaktan değil çok kaynaktan beslenin. BTC aşağılara hiç düşmezse sıkıntı yok. 13-14 k da altlara odaklanmaya başlarım.

new exciting directions in crypto-economics develop.

6684 2018-02-25 17:10:16 I concur...and volume has been dropping for most...currently.  There is/was a lot of profit taking...and tax season is upon us. This is a new maturing period, so the actual utility and use of the asset and tax implications will impact the value.
6685 2018-02-25 17:10:09 A lot of these companies won't be around in 5 years to deliver on their overloaded road maps. Thats the key! Choose projects that have a use case now, that solve a problem now, and that have already been implemented. They will survive. #Crypto #Blockchain $BTC $ETH $VEN

6743 2018-02-24 23:54:43 It’s still my belief that the Form D represents only USD investors in cash, and excludes ETH, BTC, foreign money and foreign crypto. 

*I* could be counting some foreign crypto in this ETH wallet, but that’s of little consequence.

6759 2018-02-24 23:52:22 Any that have landed on your radar so far? I know the typical "DYOR" response, just curious if any have stood out to you.
6760 2018-02-24 23:52:08 I think some regulation will make crypto even better ,safer,and give people more confidence if there is accountability and full disclosure from these company's  ..responsible laws are nessary for an honest community I believe.
And there are some thoughts. HAPPY investing
6761 2018-02-24 23:52:05 Over bought?, all time highs? Longest bull run in years? What could possibly go wrong? Lol seems to be about time for a big correction. Sell and buy Crypto!
6762 2018-02-24 23:52:01 I've tried in the past.  I don't anymore because they think I'm trying to sell them something.
6763 2018-02-24 23:51:57 In just 3 days of our #BountyCampaign we have reached more than 150 Twitter Ambassadors and more than 6 M of tokens to distribute.. The target of 15 M is near.. continue to promote us and remember.. now our fortune is your fortune..

6764 2018-02-24 23:51:49 If you think that this $crypto thing is not all about security than you are doing this wrong.
6765 2018-02-24 23:51:40 The ETH wallet I’m tracking COULD have foreign investors in it, in which case I’m double counting some percentage of the $43m in there. 

Totally possible. 

It’s also possible there are more ETH wallets I don’t know about. And I’ve seen zero info on any BTC investors

6767 2018-02-24 23:51:22 not really higher than previous unless they burn $html coins ;)
6768 2018-02-24 23:51:10 Thanks for the Tip , going to get them next week! Was searching for a nice coin , couldn't find anything. But this one is really nice and could work really good!
6769 2018-02-24 23:51:06 Can someone point me to a full spec for IOTA? I'm a bit of a newbie to cryptanalysis but would like to see if any of the things I learned in crypto class can be used here!
6770 2018-02-24 23:51:00 Remember that Kushner wanted a secure, crypto back-channel scif in the RU Embassy for him to comm w RU during the  transition.
6771 2018-02-24 23:50:59 Thank you very much.
6772 2018-02-24 23:50:44 Bought 5 #LiteCoin #LTC on the weekend’s dip below $200. Let see how this #crypto #speculation #investment pans out  should be fun to watch
6773 2018-02-24 23:50:31 Just started reading your blog last night. Feel like such a rookie but starting to realize how little transparency there is in this space (everything is a "possible top 10 coin"). Crypto is still very much the wild west, really appreciate you digging a little deeper here.

6777 2018-02-24 23:49:41 I've learned this lesson a few times over the last couple months. The emotional swings of crypto are ridiculous.
6778 2018-02-24 23:49:31 No foreign dollars accounted for in the Form D. 

Something we’ve been saying since the beginning of the ICO but never had the proper citation (thank you)

I’m more curious about how they account for crypto. 

It’s my understanding it’s NOT on the Form D, but..

6782 2018-02-24 23:49:05 you should start accepting crypto tips for appreciation...
6783 2018-02-24 23:48:42 @CDNThe3rd 

Hey Ceez, I’m a prime sub on a different account/ my Amazon account.  - in the Nano crypto currency subreddit we are seeing some traction about Ninja picking up Nano as a donation currency (XRB). - love the energ, we would like to organize a flash mob donation to you
6784 2018-02-24 23:48:28 Depends what you like.  I think $icx has more room to move and isn't paired with KRW nor on the typical S. Korea exchanges.  Either way, I think both projects are solid.  I have more in $icx at present.
6785 2018-02-24 23:48:13 There is no doubt it is possible. Just poking fun at the extreme emotions of #crypto twitter at every move.
6786 2018-02-24 23:47:57 Still bullish randy?
6787 2018-02-24 23:47:48 期待してマス！
6788 2018-02-24 23:47:19 imo 17 sats with high green volume spike supported
6789 2018-02-24 23:47:13 I gave up on Ethereum because of this. People pushed my away from Ethereum Wallet and told me just to use MEW, but using your browser for crypto is just stupid. So yeah devs don't care about the crappy user experience for light mode users. They reallly don't!!!!!

6791 2018-02-24 23:46:53 Yes but we are getting closer to the public announcement and fomo from most people and casual crypto and Coinbase ppl, some ppl wait until a few days before public announcements to buy in

6794 2018-02-24 23:46:15 İ am aware of the possible risk. İ don't just throw dollars at any project. HTML is the most "risky" one in my portfolio. They're just starting. İt's okay to take some risks. Nothing is 100% sure in crypto. But i assume you know that already.

would wait till dips a bit to strongest support charted  for best entry
yet price differences are not such high so it's kinda easy to miss the train as well
6798 2018-02-24 23:45:43 A lot of charts look crappy compared to when $crypto was at the $800+ billion market cap, so it's not as if $icx was the only coin to take a dive.  I'm not disagreeing with the assessment, just saying.  A potential variable in the near term will be a KRW pairing...

6806 2018-02-24 23:44:24 Nice analogy. I play poker too. But very new to trading / crypto. Just practicing. Small plays looking at % gain. Practicing the stop loss. Just in case one needs an exit strategy. No doubt I will.
6807 2018-02-24 23:44:19 If you’re spending more than a few hours a week as a crypto-investor, you’re doing it wrong. 1. Never have less than 75% of your port in #Bitcoin 2. Dollar cost average 3. Never use margin. 4. Remember, 99% of what you hear from traders is BS.
6808 2018-02-24 23:44:01 My biggest fear regarding Bitcoin is that any minute a huge corporation could step in and change things through bullying, like forcing someone to fold in a poker game because you have more money than them. i wish you luck though.  who knows how all this crypto malarkey turns out.

6832 2018-02-24 23:40:40 Not gonna lie, I've been afraid of this. ICX has simply  shown no resiliency or grit in Jan/Feb. Every time it's been punched by the bear market, it's simply wilted. The only thing keeping it relevant is all of the twitter og's stuck holding bags, who promote it at every turn.

6860 2018-02-24 23:35:53 Crypto fall under speculation which is all fine and well for professional speculators but has no place in a wealth management plan. Establish what rate of return is required to meet liabilities then invest in a way that creates a large margin of error. Then ride the cycles.

6895 2018-02-24 23:30:29   I would be sad, though, if I didn’t get any tips and everyone could see my boobs and how much I’ve earned. That would suck.
6896 2018-02-24 23:29:44 Be part of our community. :D We have a #crypto trading group for women, too.
6897 2018-02-24 23:29:41 oo that would be nice :)))

6903 2018-02-24 23:28:57 Real estate is previous incarnation of crypto, stable store of value + hedge against inflation. problem was you had to live in it and liquidate residence to cash out. Nobody has to live inside, or sell their dwelling to gain from or use Bitcoin.

6906 2018-02-24 23:27:49 Sold all my luxury watches to buy each dip
6907 2018-02-24 23:27:32 Another scam . Don’t fall for this shit.
6908 2018-02-24 23:27:32 Inflation is actually WONDERFUL - if you have debt, that is.

(Because the less money is worth, the less work you need to pay off the debt).

So if you add low interest rates (banks borrow from gov), it's all gravy! 

Disneyland for banks!

Why do you think banks hate crypto?
6909 2018-02-24 23:27:30 Nice. I had a much worse entry and I'm around 50% ROE, but a sadly minuscule position size. :-)
6910 2018-02-24 23:27:26 Hater is gonna hate!
6911 2018-02-24 23:27:24 You’re a true gentleman Nik, even after all that’s happened. I wish this could be said for more of the crypto community however. Hats off to you mate!
6912 2018-02-24 23:26:52 I'm I. It since December and gathering all the way down for the great promise, but it's bound to happen next month.
6913 2018-02-24 23:26:50 Have you read the newbie guide
6914 2018-02-24 23:26:43 Are they accepting crypto?
6915 2018-02-24 23:26:31 If USA banned crypto they would be intentionally fucking wit us. This the best opportunity this generation has had after taking their terrible advice. They shouldnt even care fr, they only got 20 years left here on Gods green, we got 50 years left, let us take the wheel gramps.
6916 2018-02-24 23:26:15 ありがとうございますただ、ここの100ライン割って定着すると終了ですのでお気をつけてどうぞ(＞人＜;)
6917 2018-02-24 23:26:14 I measure my success as a crypto investor by the number of likes I get on my shitposts.
6918 2018-02-24 23:25:56 Sweet!!
6919 2018-02-24 23:25:36 Twitter manipulation/FUD ? Maybe the reason is; he is trying to get cheaper coins before the BTC boom , then he will probably be bullish as he sells into the next peak We are in the “Wild West” days of crypto.
6920 2018-02-24 23:25:16 I'm not an OG but I've been around much longer than most of the crypto experts around today. These normies lack our fundamentals and just band waggening on our hodl boat for fiat gains. What happened to changing the world? Those voices are sadly drown out by these greedy normies
6921 2018-02-24 23:25:14 What a mess dude. Clean it up.
6922 2018-02-24 23:24:48 Best analogy of the crypto market I have seen....
6923 2018-02-24 23:24:45 @ICODrops Hey, how's it going?
6924 2018-02-24 23:24:16 Most people in the world can’t afford to be investors like you.
6925 2018-02-24 23:24:11 When it comes to that, crypto is in its infancy compared to equities markets. That's still a barrier for a lot of institutional investors.
6926 2018-02-24 23:24:07 You must have special needs, nobody in this thread has claimed to have personally lost money. Apology accepted.

6931 2018-02-24 23:23:27 This objection only works if you've shown this isn't the case, which you haven't. Overwhelmingly, the use case is speculation, with an eye to making actualmoney. Postulating the philosophical possibility of a non-useless crypto isn't sufficient.
6932 2018-02-24 23:23:20 I believe bitcoin itself has long term potential and you can still make 5x just holding it, not as much for other crypto tho. Retail traders speculating on short term price by shorting is just asking to be rekt tho.
6933 2018-02-24 23:23:14 Just waiting for OK to be added.  I will fund my account as soon as crypto is available. Plus, personal request here, support #dgb.
6934 2018-02-24 23:23:12 Get #yobit to fix their wallet.....been on maintenance for half a year now... Get them to sort it out as it's dead money and it's your coin they're selling on their exchange....not cool
6935 2018-02-24 23:22:53 It is kind of. Not crypto currency but its a digital currency and is by that definition unstable
6936 2018-02-24 23:22:48 Morning all, Bitcoin has dropped below its 0.382 Fib level support in the past few hours and has now came back above it again. 1hour chart is looking good for the short term and there might be a hammer candle forming on the 4hour chart which is closing in 40minutes
6937 2018-02-24 23:22:45 It's not so outlandish. Crypto (and software in general) tends to be open, so intelligent developers able to leverage those resources are well positioned to build on the shoulders of giants.

6970 2018-02-24 23:17:44 again how is this different than the Federal reserve or any other manipulated crypto market?
6971 2018-02-24 23:17:43 The FIAT banking system cannot change fast enough to adapt to #bitcoin - now comes the professional fake news to discredit #crypto while the banks buy in
6972 2018-02-24 23:17:23 He surveyed Aragorn keenly, and not without wonder. At lengh he spoke again:  ''China just banned the word #crypto''
6973 2018-02-24 23:17:06 Why would Bitcoin Cash has any importance within crypto? 

I don’t think it has any importance to what cryptocurrency is meant to be.

Just another useless coin without any analysis in order to become king of crypto.
6974 2018-02-24 23:16:49 People always want opportunities to buy lower but when price fall they get scared or just want lower, then when the rebound comes, and it is always fast, they miss it and want the price to drop more. Price speculator will kill crypto.

7033 2018-02-24 23:08:46 In crypto, I read a lot about the worse attributes of institutions - and mostly agree. Crypto has also taught me to look for solutions. You don’t impress by pointing out the worse. What’s the solution?
7034 2018-02-24 23:08:42 What's your networth tho?
7035 2018-02-24 23:08:42 —You can convert fiat into crypto, and crypto into fiat. You only need your bank card et. al, cryptocurrency exchanges do Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC).

Bidirectional Flow Arrangements (BFAs), Closed Arrangement et al, being other arrangements...

7045 2018-02-24 23:06:45 Yes, the people most invested in the network are unable to drive its network effect / economy -- this is the main weakness of PoS as the token can't drive demand for the security provided

7073 2018-02-24 23:03:36 In fact if they don't want to secure the network in such an event they might as well dump all their tokens for a competing chain or buy even more miners

7180 2018-02-24 22:48:09 This kind of tunnel vision and disregard for customers is what’s fueling the crypto revolution.  It’s going to be survival of the fittest in the banking sector.  One of the smaller guys should come out in full support of crypto and evolve, leave these dinosaurs behind.

7229 2018-02-24 22:38:52 Still having a tough time determining whether this bitcoin movement is a short squeeze or bull trap. Can it be both? Bull trap probably requires much more upward movement, but at the end of the day is it just a guess?
7230 2018-02-24 22:38:41 Dont thing so, I've sat next to plenty of people who should've been forced to buy two seats, and im talking economy plus,

7234 2018-02-24 22:38:05 i am actively building my own crypto currency. It will support our humanitarian, tech, + other coins in our network.
7235 2018-02-24 22:38:03 It does not matter if the oil reserves are real or not.
PDVSA will not sell a single barrel of oil if you are to pay them with Petros.
This means only one thing: Venezuela does not trust its own crypto-currency. If it does not, why should we?
7236 2018-02-24 22:37:59 Guys, help me please to find a tweet with predictions for 2018 from all major figures from twitter (@ToneVays @CryptoMessiah @crypto_capone and others ) can’t find it :(
7237 2018-02-24 22:37:58 @teamcopico How do you think of connecting the world of crypto and "normal" world if you can't even create a user friendly wallet for Raspberry pi? Look at @NeblioTeam wallet for Pi. One click and it is working.
7238 2018-02-24 22:37:57 Bots really only work with High Frequency Trading, which no crypto exchange could support. I've been in Btc for 7 years and these up and downs are normal.

7264 2018-02-24 22:33:52 You're going in reverse of your original tweet which was "if the total MC doesn't get above.... then the crypto is doomed" I am very aware of btc's position. What you're not realizing is the total spaces MC will compress as shit coins fall to 0, and btc can still hold a 250b cap
7265 2018-02-24 22:33:52 Good point, but in the case of ETH, the rules were set up in advance and the miners were told, up front, about the switch to PoS. It's not an arbitrary censure.

7285 2018-02-24 22:31:47 We’re moving to Colombia in January and starting a brewery and building apartments with crypto profits. Should be fun! After that I’ll be trying to get people to visit. We’ll accept crypto at all our restaurants and apartments there.
7286 2018-02-24 22:31:45 What's shameful is that you're spreading outrage and negativity instead of turning that frown upside down and buying some crypto!
7287 2018-02-24 22:31:43 I like the sentiment. But I don’t think any Institutional investor that runs a fund is going to put so much into crypto space that it would threaten the stability of his fund. Also LPs are locked in typically until fund “finishes” by returning capital or capital plus profits.
7288 2018-02-24 22:31:08 yep my $ETC sclaping profits for about 2.5 hours is something like 2 dollars lol. But I am having FUN so any change I find in my guitar box while I am jamming is bonus #crypto

7320 2018-02-24 22:26:45 I was planning on doing a small rig initially, 3-4 1070s, but everything is just overly inflated, I might as well just buy the crypto now until the prices come down.

7324 2018-02-24 22:26:35 Count how many times you have posted this in the last week.....
7325 2018-02-24 22:26:32 I had the same issue. Took me about 15 attempts to get it.
7326 2018-02-24 22:26:28 60% of my crypto gains listed
7327 2018-02-24 22:26:16 I’m not panicking, at least but others might be tbh

7329 2018-02-24 22:26:09 @Cointelegraph what US BANKS still allow crypto purchases ?
7330 2018-02-24 22:25:49 Now 104000
7331 2018-02-24 22:25:46 I just logged onto #coinsmarkets.  Can't believe its true. Surely this a sign from the crypto gods that spring is coming and good times are ahead. Can't wait to be reunited with my coins. $ECA $COLX $ALQO

7335 2018-02-24 22:25:29 What will MOVE coin/token price is code improvements  + use + actual value provided. IMO

When a token saves the world millions, billions, and trillions of dollars it will be worth much much more than it is today.
7336 2018-02-24 22:25:26 Dude just give good advise on Crypto. No one cares about the drink or the weed.
7337 2018-02-24 22:25:24 Is that because of the 88000 sell
7338 2018-02-24 22:25:19 just finished filming my video then almost fainted  looked in the mirror & was white as a ghost.  all those bright lights & i forgot to drink water...high altitude, 420..not a good mix  but... at least my video is awesome! and will hopefully make me lots of $ for crypto! 
7339 2018-02-24 22:25:18 Which panic lol
7340 2018-02-24 22:25:17 @crypto_bobby Do you use libsyn to post the audio from youtube to podcast form, or some other service?
7341 2018-02-24 22:25:01 Around 90% of new business fail, $crypto is the same. Very few will survive in 4 years from now on. Choose wisely and take profits before it burnts

7346 2018-02-24 22:24:42 I thought this meant a presentation on how to make crypto memes and wasn’t even surprised
7347 2018-02-24 22:24:34 "Hive" is an oriented acyclic graph, based on which the crypto currency will work. "Hive" makes it possible to carry out transfers without commissions, as well as without waiting for confirmation of transactions.

7350 2018-02-24 22:23:59 People should feel free to vote for whomever they want without fear of being bullied. Also color and race of people shouldn't be relevant and shouldn't be discussed. It's 2018 - time to focus on crypto instead of race and hate!
7351 2018-02-24 22:23:56 You’re amazing! Thank you!

7360 2018-02-24 22:22:28 At work rn, might fuck around and invest in crypto currency
7361 2018-02-24 22:22:23 Can you tell the intern to stop publishing the same garbage ?
7362 2018-02-24 22:22:22 100 JPY(BTC): 1115.110 ~ 1117.823 KRW(BTC)
7363 2018-02-24 22:22:09 The game of multiple coins, drama, crypto being crypto.
7364 2018-02-24 22:22:08 That desk is way too clean and organized for any respectable crypto trader.
7365 2018-02-24 22:21:52 Ultimately the state has to pay people to enforce their rules. When their money loses all purchasing power and crypto takes over, social structures will change for the better.
7366 2018-02-24 22:21:40 And if some cryptocurrency-related thing wants it, I’m selling crypto[.]sx for only $100,000. I can also sell it to cryptographers who don’t want it to end up in a cryptocurrency-related thing’s hands. Go for it, it’s a fabulous deal! (ahaha, who knows, I can try…).
7367 2018-02-24 22:21:27 Would be good to know. I have been considering moving back to the google authenticator app on my old phone (which is disconnected from the internet) and backing up the QR codes to an encrypted flash drive. Getting paranoid these days.

7373 2018-02-24 22:21:05 Hey @aelfblockchain. I can't seem to access my dashboard, any known issues?
7374 2018-02-24 22:21:03 Love the reviews and research you do on projects. You do an awesome job. I go to your twitter feed and youtube channel for my daily Crypto updates and news.
7375 2018-02-24 22:21:01 Yeah, but can it play Crysis?
7376 2018-02-24 22:20:35 Ripple and TRON have the same supply. Ripple has reached $3. When #TRON platform is complete 100s of million users will have easy access to trx. With other tokens on #tron platform and all the partnerships I think TRON easily reaches $3 this year.

7380 2018-02-24 22:20:09 i think you've basically got your "anarcho"-capitalists (crypto fash) and your anarcho-"capitalists" (anarchists in waiting), but the former group definitely seems more numerous

7397 2018-02-24 22:18:46 I’ll upload a better picture so you guys can do one of me plz. Thanks.
7398 2018-02-24 22:18:42 Please talk to someone who has been in crypto for atleast a few months before posting stupid shit like this. You have a reputation @bloomberg , don't fuck it up
7399 2018-02-24 22:18:35 Bloomberg for me, they got a way of making every crypto headline sickening.

7405 2018-02-24 22:17:48 Yes you can eat it all.. the shoes are rice crispy treats and the cake is the shoe box... I also take Crypto for payment but NO one in my area seems to know about it 
7406 2018-02-24 22:17:45 @crypto_birb doesn’t concern himself with little bounces. He’s saying that sometime relatively soon, before the bull market really turns it up, we will see 8.3k tested

7415 2018-02-24 22:16:59 Excited to see what March has in store for #crypto! I'm hoping to see strong #altcoins and maybe a #bitcoin to stabilize around 10k for a few weeks?

7422 2018-02-24 22:16:32 U bought at $4.60  no drama mate. Now listen, why u worried about a small dip? Imagine what $btcp will be in a few months. It's bitcoin with privacy. Enough said.
7423 2018-02-24 22:16:31 Makes sense
7424 2018-02-24 22:16:16 Really. Do there would be a 30 sell wall ot say 960?

7442 2018-02-24 22:14:51 The worst part about #crypto @Twitter being dead is that political twitter is starting to seep through. Come on people, dank memes only!
7443 2018-02-24 22:14:47 I got it finally.
7444 2018-02-24 22:14:26 Good choice, got it in black

7447 2018-02-24 22:13:54 Uou are biased coz u said you are holding more #ardor lol  gosh
7448 2018-02-24 22:13:52 So if there is a sell wall of 4 BTC at 9500 then its hard to breskthrough that im guessing. So it probably wont go up
7449 2018-02-24 22:13:51 
7450 2018-02-24 22:13:41 Especially if the giant inverse H&S play out..
7451 2018-02-24 22:13:38 9k small bounce probably
7452 2018-02-24 22:13:29 That's one option to avoid the topic. The discussion of crypto currency usually increases and decreases along the price. #correlation
7453 2018-02-24 22:13:25 Classics:

7475 2018-02-24 22:10:22 I pray for that to happen! I’ve enjoyed being immersed in crypto to avoid that junk. Good thing is that there is a lot of good people out there still. Just the ones on tv and the news are completely out of whack. Trump get elected gave me hope for the silent hard working masses.
7476 2018-02-24 22:10:12 i bought the top in dec 2013...worked out pretty well for me
7477 2018-02-24 22:10:08 I like to think I have a great track record in picking right business moves. I believe crypto will be my best one!
7478 2018-02-24 22:10:07 IKR!! But imo these projects will all fail. Is it even legal? Crypto was more fun before ICO's though

7482 2018-02-24 22:09:32 It's not possible to ban crypto and becomes even harder to do so when you give people an on-ramp into the unregulated crypto ecosystem with the one that is state backed. All citizens would need to do is flip on a VPN and exchange iranian crypto for any other crypto on an exchange

7514 2018-02-24 22:05:17 be careful bro, the btc amount is what price you want to buy it for, ie when you press last. then you put the amount of thorn coins you want to receive. under it will tell you the fee and the total amount of BTC you will be spending.
7515 2018-02-24 22:05:07 Ok. I got website open and in basic. I see sell orders to the left in red and below are buy orders.  How do i see just all sell orders and where the walls are?

7538 2018-02-24 22:02:16 Possibly more laughable is when @JoelKatz replies in jest with “Friday, 1:30pm PST” and part of the crypto world (lacking wit) goes crazy.

7610 2018-02-24 21:55:18 Well that's unfortunate for that coin, because that regime owes to much money to other countries and he is paying it off with oil. So, how is he going to back the coin with oil they don't own? I would not invest in anything Maduro puts out into crypto.
7611 2018-02-24 21:55:18 Has anybody thought that if Bcash could destroy #bitcoin then all confidence in crypto would be destroyed? If bitcoin’s value goes to zero and Bcash’s moons then that value will be replaced by some other PR campaign and then the whole thing is ruined.

One thing I’ve learned is nobody really knows what the hell they are talking about in crypto Twitter.  Just a bunch of egos claiming they make better calls than the other guy.
7622 2018-02-24 21:53:34 Ok. I have it open now. Will do.
7623 2018-02-24 21:53:34 It's a mid term hold for me so Didn't use stop loss. Filled 2/3 of my position if it dips more I'll average down

7627 2018-02-24 21:53:00 I have other  to use for alts.   I have 4 ltc.  Just still learning the alts. Figuring oit when to go i. To get the 5 to 10 percent gains and not the drops.
7628 2018-02-24 21:52:51 that was actually a hard game!
7629 2018-02-24 21:52:48 Tell me more about the crypto gaming community plz!
7630 2018-02-24 21:52:33 Agreed, but not interested in buying sports cars...I am in to crypto to change the world..
7631 2018-02-24 21:52:32 #Bitcoin cut below $9500. I still like $9K as being the key support before bounce back. Too much positive news... but whales make splashes at unforeseeable times.

7640 2018-02-24 21:51:59 Yos shortly
7641 2018-02-24 21:51:50 My fear is this is less about money for some manipulators but instead an orchestrated strategy for killing the confidence for mainstreet investors, crushing our will with constant and unpredictable disappointment, and ultimately destroying the crypto market.

7646 2018-02-24 21:51:22 We’re currently in a bear market, and the btc private fork is happening in 4 days. Btc gold, which is a shit fork of btc, is currently at $116 (0.0122 sats) and is #19 in marketcap in this bear market. Bitcoin private actually has real world value. Just think. $zcl

7657 2018-02-24 21:49:53 Yea you didn’t hear after bitcoin and almost all alts went down they had a press conference to announce their retirement from crypto it was in all the major publications
7658 2018-02-24 21:49:45 Yep, I became active on twitter just for crypto.
7659 2018-02-24 21:49:43 In order for mass adoption in crypto, consumers must feel safe using it without worrying about deception. Personally I think, everyone must educate themselves by practicing better 1. SECURITY (2FA, hardware wallet) 2. DUE DILIGENCE 3. DTA (Dont Trust Anyone) approach
7660 2018-02-24 21:49:08 They’re supposed to have two coins, dgd and dgx. Dgd is NOT the gold coin. Dgx doesnt seem up yet or something...
7661 2018-02-24 21:49:02 Ça dépend, vendre à perte n'est pas toujours une mauvaise idée contrairement à ce qu'on pense. Si ta vente à perte de permet de faire des gains plus rapidement et de récupérer tes loss plus vite, ça peut être une bonne stratégie.
7662 2018-02-24 21:48:58 Depuis la révolution industrielle, l'avancement technique était freiné par une économie contrôlé par l'argent. La Blockchain nous a ouvert les portes à des projets prometteurs et dépasse tout sur l'échelle de Gartner

7666 2018-02-24 21:47:57 Do a video on trading bots. You might as well take advantage of them while you can.
7667 2018-02-24 21:47:49 BTC really struggles now to defend the 9.5K ... the bull run from 6K to 12K was short lived and now we are back under 10K and dropping every day, tech is fine, news is fine - so why does the BTC&crypto dropping? Choppy markets!

7672 2018-02-24 21:47:12 The sell walls are in red right? Ive been keeping an eye on those. Plus looking at the charts. Not sure if I wanna day trade the bitcoin or just let it ride for the year.
7673 2018-02-24 21:47:09 Reason 2 is probably more valid... binance loves to hedge... not sure the exact mechanics or what dgd does but that is the general idea  : proof of asset protocol
7674 2018-02-24 21:47:08 Actually, hadn't looked for 30 mins ....0.0009 BTC , so approx $8...I think?!!

7691 2018-02-24 21:45:01 The most common argument for merchants against integrating crypto payment solution is volatility. 

What would be your counter argument?

7702 2018-02-24 21:43:39 What is the current price USD.
7703 2018-02-24 21:43:28 In my opinion there is. It's a bit harder due to the airdrop coming pretty soon, so FOMO could kick in.

7719 2018-02-24 21:41:27 You're overlooking the fact that crypto doesen't ever just stop abruptly. Price fluctuations of 50%+ will look like little anthills 10 years from now. Absent from your conclusion is recognizance of the $USD valuation medium, an inflationary token with 0 devs working on it ;-).

7770 2018-02-24 21:32:51 Twitter is like group therapy for cryptos. A 12 step program that lasts a lifetime lol.
7771 2018-02-24 21:32:41 It would be too good to be true if it wasn’t choreographed. They’re seeking fiat exit, knowing it doesn’t work and have ‘allowed’ crypto revolution. However, experiments like this often backfire.
7772 2018-02-24 21:32:13 This is not true. People think this, an the same company is Working on it, but this is not that coin. Thibk about it, if one dgd Would represent gold it Would mean that if the price Goes up people buy inflated gold. It Goes up, but at Some point Will dump as hard as any other:)
7773 2018-02-24 21:32:12 That's true.  When I was in the Air Force in a career field that required a Top Secret Crypto clearance, guys who were unable to pass the extended background investigations were transferred into career fields that didn't require a clearance.  There should be NO exceptions!

7777 2018-02-24 21:31:33 Yep too cool that they hid that there for kids to find Easter egg I guess
7778 2018-02-24 21:31:30 'Profit is profit' is nonsense. 

It ignores opportunity cost. 
If you spend a lot of time & take on a lot of risk for minimal gains, you can't redeem yourself by parroting that phrase.

Be selective in your trades: wait for the high quality setups & let them run.

7779 2018-02-24 21:31:27 Buen artículo y muy bien explicados los diferentes productos de Ripple. 
7780 2018-02-24 21:31:21 i dont hear much about lows and highs in the crypto groups i think it is the most important indicator.
7781 2018-02-24 21:31:19 Are you just looking to have some crypto to play around with? Or do you want to experience mining?

7787 2018-02-24 21:30:39 Honestly man you say a lot of nothing. Wise sounding generalities that obviously make sense in a vacuum. We care about today, right now. That’s your value-add. What is crypto Medici doing today in response to market conditions? Then we assimilate your data point with others.
7788 2018-02-24 21:30:38 Yeah sure comes from a good place.Just not buying into @pnhearer's crap.Bringing feelings into it, because he has a vested interest in a coin.This is pure business and we are playing in a manipulated market,none of us are in crypto to help the poor. Wishing you all good luck!!
7789 2018-02-24 21:30:21 Actually the russians are hoarding gold.

7820 2018-02-24 21:27:26 I am just curious about how "crypto TA twitter" works. Do you just make stuff up or do you ever provide any evidence for your ghost stories of different market actors? Is this really mean to be educational/factual or is it more like celebrity rumors entertainment magazines?
7821 2018-02-24 21:27:25 Ugh #DCBlockchainSummit price doubled to $3k and still won't take #crypto.

7848 2018-02-24 21:24:28 parece interessante! pelo o que eu vi, o oiWarren oferece produtos customizados pelo perfil do cliente. Talvez no mundo de crypto, seria mais interessante inicialmente produtos como os fundos que a bitwise oferece. O que vc acha?

7851 2018-02-24 21:24:25 No point in checking my crypto... that shit keeps dropping..
7852 2018-02-24 21:24:21 It has nothing to do with "catching" them.

You find the crypto with solid fundamentals, and preferably has not yet pumped. Or is at least a few months out of a pump fractal. You accumulate; for weeks or even months

When they fly, sell on the way up

Move on; don't fall in love

7856 2018-02-24 21:23:29 In the long run, those drops won't matter once big crypto's will become established companies. It will be like buying a share of a company but rather than just holding a piece of paper, you'll own a utility token. The future looks good for those who are patient.

7892 2018-02-24 21:17:40 But I have many awesome crypto domain names; and are ready to put to work!
7893 2018-02-24 21:17:32 Sure. Most crypto will grow in 2018. As long as investors buy cheap now and hold until Dec. The difference is Trx is cheaper and therefore we can buy more for our money. 20x more for $1.
7894 2018-02-24 21:17:28 1/ If not balanced with humility, crypto's lineage of fierce opinions & pride will be increasingly interpreted as obnoxious boasting of the nouveau riche.

7902 2018-02-24 21:16:32 @DigitalLawrence is still building the program, he's only had a handful of guests so far but I think that's the direction it will eventually get to. We only had 30 minutes or we would've really dug deep into crypto so we wanted to make this a "Welcome" to people new in cryptos.

7920 2018-02-24 21:13:01 Too late lost my coins and my account is locked. Waiting for customer service to help me. Have all my crypto currency in gdax and coinbase. Not sure if I’m going to loose all my money .
7921 2018-02-24 21:12:51 Time to start filling your bags, buy at Cycle Lows in smaller time frames. Use some good indicators... Seen some massively legit Alt Daily sticks... Bout to thrash out some charts...Im a TA savage!! #bitcoin #crypto #trading
7922 2018-02-24 21:12:51 Many in $crypto stay anonymous for opsec reasons, not revealing ethnicity, nationality, age, gender etc either. Not flashing looks helps preventing emotional bias, too. Members can be judged only by their contribution, not shape of their boobs or other superficialities
7923 2018-02-24 21:12:33 A lot of people will be getting refunds this year from their taxes, while paying off existing debts is important. It is also as important to set a side just a little bit to invest in a high yielding crypto exchange. $10 - $20 - $100 - $200 is all it takes to get started.

7930 2018-02-24 21:12:08 any advice on how to get a ICO off the ground ..I no you don't like crypto ,but with your no how any help would go along way .

7955 2018-02-24 21:07:55 I don’t think pension fiduciaries would or even can invest directly in crypto right now. It’s unlikely and too aggressive with the current risk profile and custody issues.
7956 2018-02-24 21:07:49 @inndigow for the love of crypto

7967 2018-02-24 21:06:17 They seem to be sorely lacking in any sort of broad appreciation of the 1A, just what seems to serve their narrow, sheltered, simple, crypto-fascist worldview. I’m putting my long money on the Marjory Stoneman Douglas kids over these two and their ilk.

7969 2018-02-24 21:05:55 Perhaps those who want to buy crypto could mortgage their homes instead of amassing credit card debt - few understand basic financial management & that is troublesome
7970 2018-02-24 21:05:54 Because?

7986 2018-02-24 21:04:24 Not a bad choice ..... there are worse out there , me personally I wouldn’t go more than 10-15% of your portfolio. Obviously depends on your portfolio size and it’s a hodl coin . Be very on point with your money/risk management #dyor

8003 2018-02-24 21:01:56 The interesting thing about crypto's fixed inflation is that because of mining electricity costs, new tokens must be dumped onto fairly illiquid markets rather than diminished by printed debt in a fractional reserve system.

8010 2018-02-24 21:00:50 This inverse head and shoulders on $BTC is pretty tenuous but if we head up from around $9,400 it might play out.
8011 2018-02-24 21:00:43 I think most traders are finding out that crypto trading is a whole diff world and ballgame than forex. A lot of the same rules don't seem to apply
8012 2018-02-24 21:00:41 It will be added to our canon of trading options. As gold was added to trade. And money to gold. Money and banks are not going away but they will come to terms with crypto and accept its validity with time. Until then we shall reap the gains of early adoption

End game getting people into crypto the safe, secure, and educated way will benefit all. It's also an avenue for me to refer my friends who are "interested" in crypto to so they don't bug me.

8039 2018-02-24 20:57:16 Don't follow people who tweet TA, or people who like/retweet TA.

Although I do find crypto TA entertaining, I place far more belief in EMH and the futility of outperforming assets over long-term via trading.

8076 2018-02-24 20:53:45 A decent amount of people interpreted it as crypto-white nationalism (not in those exact words) in 2004 when Samuel Huntington pointed it out.
8077 2018-02-24 20:53:43 What's your take on VEN?
8078 2018-02-24 20:53:39 bitcoin usually bounce at least once   or twice at support so you can expect it
8079 2018-02-24 20:53:28 Let the USA regulate all they want. They will only push the crypto companies into another country for operations.

8102 2018-02-24 20:51:00 the big problem with crypto is that nobody buys except when shit crashes. that's like shopping only when there is a sale. good way to go out of business.
8103 2018-02-24 20:50:58 The gold standard of 2FA supposedly.
8104 2018-02-24 20:50:48 Why limit yourself to just bitcoin when you can use other crypto currencies too. Think bigger

8121 2018-02-24 20:49:22 Dear @BankofAmerica, I've been a loyal customer for 17 years. I do not see a material reason for you all to be citing risk factors associated with crypto as a reason to be shutting down consumer accounts. Be part of the future and don't get left in the dust.
8122 2018-02-24 20:49:21 How about a Tron $trx tattoo on your dick? Since so many people got fucked buying this Crap, it feels an appropriate spot

8154 2018-02-24 20:45:01 Doesn't matter then. Usually a good exchange will have a cold/offline wallet containing the majority of funds tho, so you should be able to get refunded partially in case it happens. No one should count on it tho.

8164 2018-02-24 20:44:19 Donc ce n’est pas la cause d’une inflation exponentielle , d’une économie basée essentiellement sur un pétrole qui s’est cassé la gueule et un record d’importation de produits ? Mais tout va s’arranger, ils ont lancé la crypto monnaie.
8165 2018-02-24 20:44:09 @FisherInvestNL fuck you, fucking scammers. get rekt by crypto soon
8166 2018-02-24 20:43:58 The more you check the charts, the more stress/anxiety/worry you have. Leave it be. Let market forces take control. If people believe in crypto, crypto will continue to rise over the long-term. Simple.
8167 2018-02-24 20:43:42 Im just a noob but ive come to the conclusion crypto is manipulated AF, thus it will bounce back sooner or later
8168 2018-02-24 20:43:41 have you seen any of @aantonop youtube vidoes they might be good to listen to I think you need youtube red or something to just listen though.

8185 2018-02-24 20:41:40 Don’t you think it can retest 6k$ ?
8186 2018-02-24 20:41:37 If some exchange gets hacked do they need your 2fa or it doesnt matter?
8187 2018-02-24 20:41:35 Possibly concerning, but at the end of the day, nobody can predict the future. Who knows where we will end up. Its all in the belief system. If people believe in crypto, it will continue to be a thing. Simple.

8191 2018-02-24 20:41:22 With all these crypto companies saturating the market it's bound to collapse soon.
8192 2018-02-24 20:41:19 So is BTC dying? Surely time for ETH/NEO to step up and gain some serious ground. Would love to see that happen but know so many in the crypto world would lose a lot so it may not happen for a WHILE
8193 2018-02-24 20:41:09 Interesting. I run a group on Facebook called the human experience. Based off this exact idea.
8194 2018-02-24 20:41:01 Lay out step by step what you think wall street is going to try and do
8195 2018-02-24 20:40:55 I saw that, that's actually what got me interested in asking everyone else!
8196 2018-02-24 20:40:50 Full crypto in and out and ability to use crypto as cash with card- as said, full crypto and you win
8197 2018-02-24 20:40:45 Personally I'm a fan of encrypted cloud backups. Password protected .zip or .7z files on multiple cloud instances seem like the best option to me at this time. 

IMO you should be able to wake up naked, get handed an internet connected laptop, and retrieve your crypto.

8201 2018-02-24 20:39:44 Most investors may not realise that the rise of crypto-currency is in itself built on a recently heightened crimewave involving cybercrime and ransomware. However,  the plain truth is that investors will never shy away from investing in the quick returns found in ‘blood money’.

8213 2018-02-24 20:38:45 When designing your personal crypto backup strategy, think of the following vectors:

- Fire. All your possessions burn to the ground
- Law Enforcement. Fascists steal all of your belongings & try to take your crypto assets
- Death. You want your loved ones to have your crypto.

8215 2018-02-24 20:38:30 There ought to be a crypto currency named "Thoughts and Prayers" #showerthoughts
8216 2018-02-24 20:38:15 Here's my thought! As much as we want to believe that crypto market is a real fight between bulls and bears I can't help to think that it's really WWE with choreographed match which they already know the outcome. Let's not be naive. Success of this space lies on the 1%
8217 2018-02-24 20:38:13 Why would the rewards grow over time?
8218 2018-02-24 20:38:03 well bro, if you get your stacks out at around 9k, we all be fine!

8225 2018-02-24 20:37:02 Time for some consolidation on the $nano front, it was a hell of a ride. Amazing that we are hovering around 130k just days after some sold close to 60k. Let's recharge the rockets #NANO fans!

8231 2018-02-24 20:36:35 I don't understand why people are selling right now. We just have to complete this right shoulder and the bear market is over. Just a little patience my friends, coming months will be extremely bullish for crypto! $BTC

8247 2018-02-24 20:34:39 I'm always wanted to learn but there's just too much of vague  :-)

Personally, I would love a detector that told me if my website was infected with a crypto mining JavaScript, that would be brilliant
8248 2018-02-24 20:34:39 Same here
8249 2018-02-24 20:34:25 i would want to warn every indian #crypto trader out there, never ever trade with @bitbns exchange, sh!ttest exchange. period.

8253 2018-02-24 20:33:59 Every day I enjoy opening up Coinbase and watching the crypto go up and down, up and down.  Wheeeee!!!!!!! :)

- Maduro is still a fucked up dictator.
- Bear market fatigue.
- Kids and plebs have been shaken out.
- Puerto Rico is cryptonaire heaven.
- Bank of America admits it's scared of its future.
- J.P Morgan is bull on crypto.
- Many alts are back at their lows.

8257 2018-02-24 20:33:39 Use Delta it's way better than blockfolio. It took me a while to switch, but do not regret it...

8263 2018-02-24 20:32:47 Thanks. I an not an expert here but this looks like a correction of the recent bounce from 6k rather than the end of crypto....
8264 2018-02-24 20:32:39 Still laughing? Lol
8265 2018-02-24 20:32:38 yeah feels like either an alt dead cat is inbound as soon as btc stops or a major capitulation event setup executing in the next few hours

8269 2018-02-24 20:32:03 Why didn't you transfer to a wallet?
8270 2018-02-24 20:31:53 Haven't heard much about that yet, I wonder if most exchanges support it?

8285 2018-02-24 20:29:47 Nice chart, 9k seems like a solid psychological level.
8286 2018-02-24 20:29:43 You would have to check with support/guides. Not every coin no, and online web wallets are the least safe ones :(
8287 2018-02-24 20:29:42 Your goal right now should be getting more crypto rather then USD when we start to get parabolic and everyone gets greedy then you should be thinking about getting USD.
8288 2018-02-24 20:29:39 The tireless upgrading of @DeepOnionx technology really creates an impression that it will reach an important place in the crypto market very soon.

8291 2018-02-24 20:29:00 #Crypto tip: Things to look for in an #ICO: 

- Is the Company a solid entity that can make an idea into reality? Does it have a solid background in what it wants to bring to market?
- Is the idea or product/service itself disruptive enough or can it solve a problem?
8292 2018-02-24 20:29:00 Is February of 2018 the last opportunity to buy in major cryptocurrency? I'm talking #bitcoin #litecoin #etherium and few others?
Are we gonna see these prices ever again??

8373 2018-02-24 20:19:13 Safe travels! Any events or talks scheduled for interested crypto /  cardano fans to meet or listen to you in Japan this trip?
8374 2018-02-24 20:19:11 For real, right. That’s too funny.

8377 2018-02-24 20:18:36 You of all people should know about bots as they are used to spread malware crypto mining software about and to trade on Poloniex and other exchanges.
8378 2018-02-24 20:18:26 So true Allen. 
Happy you are playing crypto like the rest of the woke poker players :)

I've long said that far more crypto is lost from locking yourself out of a wallet than from some sophisticated computer attack. 

Agree a user-dependent balance is needed.
8379 2018-02-24 20:18:10 This is one of the reasons I can find no arguments against voluntary crypto UBI... A social ideal that I can find no violation of capitalism for

8383 2018-02-24 20:17:27 now i see why people were leaving crypto twitter...they sensed it was over.

8385 2018-02-24 20:17:00 Look at what he's achieved in that 2 months. Verily I tell you he speaks the Truth and during the coming Desolation of Crypto there will be much gnashing of teeth. Listen then, if you have ears, gird up your loins and prepare for the mother of all crashes. May Poop be with you.

8387 2018-02-24 20:16:41 #Gaddafi would be alive today if he launched Libyan crypto instead of national currency back by gold. Although i like the idea of Bolivian cryptos as big hail marry, i fear its gonna be one more dead project.
8388 2018-02-24 20:16:33 so all those noobs that are on fake accounts with fake pictures, are legit just as the fake accounts claiming to return to you 10x the amount of crypto you send, so dont believe you have the moral to attack anybody ! n those elementary schools jokes works with your kids friends

8411 2018-02-24 20:13:25 The problem with most chartists and technical guys in crypto is they don’t know shit about fundamentals.
8412 2018-02-24 20:13:18 That's far different than "crypto is dead." I think many of us understand a lower low is possible, further correction, etc. But that's a far cry from declaring something dead Poop :)

 #DomusCoins #ICO
8442 2018-02-24 20:09:04 I find the marketing tactics behind the project disgusting, propaganda & confusion to new investors. It’s known for its P&D & even Ver had to back it with 30,000 $BTC to gather momentum. Straight up, the project is a joke & im confident it will not sustain a top 5 spot by EOY.
8443 2018-02-24 20:08:58 Can you respond directly to some of your audience? Really helps. How long have you been in crypto... and how about overall trading background? I think lots of us want to know more about you. Need like a AMA or something
8444 2018-02-24 20:08:52 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。

8469 2018-02-24 20:04:46 Bitcoin cash is an alt coin, this is fact. If it didn’t try to claim to be the “real bitcoin” then it would have a much larger number of supporters & even respect as a whole. The fact Bcash has had to buy out things like @bitcoin, Reddit & others is an absolute joke!

8513 2018-02-24 20:00:43 Not sure if there's a wallet that can hold all of them together. Best approach would be to download their own wallets, for each project u have a large quantity that you want to put in a cold/offline storage.
8514 2018-02-24 20:00:38 Yes j’ai fait le plein 
8515 2018-02-24 20:00:34 Crypto was talking about having arms to defend against tyranny, not hunting. You need an ar-15 to hunt hogs? lol at that. I suggest you pay attention to the thread instead of throwing out streams of consciousness.

8523 2018-02-24 20:00:00 You get 1 coin for every 1.000 you had. The value of the new coin will be 1.000 times the value of 1 old coin. At least, that’s what most people expect to happen. If anyone would sell for less that would be stupid. In the end it is a market and it all depends on the demand

"Trade-offs" (how tf do u even do that), drunken rants, and walking away from the game are getting old. 

I joined crypto cause I thought you guys were better than that.
8527 2018-02-24 19:59:42 #Poe is in my opinion one of the most undervalued currencies out there. It has a true purpose in the success of crypto.
8528 2018-02-24 19:59:26 Can't give a firm date, review times with Apple app store are hard to pinpoint, but we have a working iOS app so it's just waiting for store approval. Thanks!!

8538 2018-02-24 19:58:10 Everyone claims to be an expert on crypto these days, but I’m finding that 98% of them don’t even understand the basics of mining, consensus algorithms, the basics of blockchain, or even basic computing principles or architectures. 
8539 2018-02-24 19:58:06 LOL
8540 2018-02-24 19:57:58 There is a slide from @rogerkver's @Anarchapulco presentation titled something along the lines of

8548 2018-02-24 19:57:15 Out of curiosity are you seeing more crypto currency from international services or Aussie based ones? Just wondering if Aussie Payment providers focus on legal or imparting their moral views. I'm an asumming underlying issue is getting someone to process credit cards etc
8549 2018-02-24 19:57:15 Yup, I use an old moto G for it. Also, LINUX =D
8550 2018-02-24 19:56:59 Blockchain and crypto thinking is so incredibly short term, I’ve ever seen anything like it. Attention spans and opinions last hours.

8552 2018-02-24 19:56:16 If you're willing to wait a year, here are a few that at good entry points now & are as close as they come in this crazy crypto universe to a sure bet:

8554 2018-02-24 19:56:08 I still see a lot of Crypto related ads on Facebook , specially Ice Rock mining and WePower .. Thinking just how useless their moderating bots are ... or may be Crypto is just unstoppable!
8555 2018-02-24 19:55:47 I Appreciate The Ppl That Add Me To Their Crypto Groups/List For Insight Even Tho I Haven’t Been As Active Lately. There’s Really No Point To TA Alts When $BTC Is Still In a Bearish Trend

8558 2018-02-24 19:55:33 does not look like a coin to hold..
8559 2018-02-24 19:55:28 Do you mean airplane mode?  Also as I understand it, can't have the 2FA for exchange on two different devices.
8560 2018-02-24 19:55:21 Nice. Been running that chip for about a year now. Works well. Processors are running cheap right now with GPU being so expensive from the crypto mining crap.

8562 2018-02-24 19:55:12 Personally I don't like calling Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin." 
That's confusing to the massive amount of new users finding crypto each day. 

I prefer "Bitcoin Core" & "Bitcoin Cash," and I understand that will anger Core supporters.

IMO BCH has become relevant enough to do so.

8574 2018-02-24 19:53:25 If you think that, you are extremely misled or misguided by the sources you trust. Bitcoin Cash is supported by the legends such as Gavin who contributed greatly to the success of crypto as a whole. Your statement is ignorant and wrong.

8614 2018-02-24 19:48:18 Crypto is evolving at an astronomical pace, as the complexity steadily grows. We need a middle ground, and something that isn't Coinbase that is an easy outlet for buying and storing crypto with more practical use case scenarios if we want to attract more normal users.
8615 2018-02-24 19:48:14 Weren’t you talking earlier this week about the recent run should have gone lower? I’ll retract my statement if it’s unfounded but I vaguely remember seeing frustration maybe that was any crypto/queen

8634 2018-02-24 19:45:42 Just read a little bit more about this. It isn't an exchange so you most likely will be getting fees but don't know it and you can't withdrawal your crypto.  It isn't for me until they give you the ability to withdrawal. Without this function the crypto you buy has no use.

8657 2018-02-24 19:41:19 Why not just buy their other hyperinflating currency directly then?  I don't see how the crypto is any more appealing.  You'd be much better off buying black market bolivares than buying petros and accepting the official exchange rate!

8668 2018-02-24 19:39:59 look at market depth. That is like the easiest and most base level indicator to use. If there is a thin pankcake of buyers and a large mountain of sellers, this is not ok to just sit there. That's what ETC sorta kinda looks like right now.

8728 2018-02-24 19:32:20 You, I, 4 others play poker. We forget our $. We all agree to ALL keep a ledger of every hand, bet, etc. Game ends we settle up. Because each ledger is cross checked... No one can lie about final sum owed at end. Then real money is paid out. That's blockchain with crypto.

8741 2018-02-24 19:30:39 Long story short.. if you use leverage trading, make sure your liquidation price is 50-100$+ below support or above resistance or else you will get rekt on shake outs

8743 2018-02-24 19:30:39 snipperonald At 8900 they’d prob try to short lol
8744 2018-02-24 19:30:38 The exchanges make money off volume.. how do you get the most volume?  Shake outs.. dump it down to a support and make people move their long positions to short or vice versa (or liquidate)

Rinse, repeat.. it’s really simple.  If it looks too obvious on the chart, prob fake

In the @cnbcafrica Crypto Trader interview, was that Decrep and Pivex? Hard to decipher from some slight background noise. Thank you in advance!
8772 2018-02-24 19:28:22 I agree... It is staying pretty solid.
8773 2018-02-24 19:28:20 I Owned sveral businesses over the years. Now crypto & forex is my business. I much prefer trading over any business i owned. Less start up costs, way less expenses & headaches. I wish I would have started trading years ago.

8777 2018-02-24 19:27:55 Yeah, i think they genuinly tried to create a proper conversation. That's one of the reasons I like the crypto show, even though im usually outnumbered. :)
8778 2018-02-24 19:27:35 Great call. Here's hoping the rest of the $NEO tokens rally  (okay really only just $TNC)
8779 2018-02-24 19:27:22 Well if you are a market manipulator you exactly know that stops will be placed exactly there. It's the worst advise I've seen in crypto space for a while. You are new to trading aren't you?
8780 2018-02-24 19:27:10 #BTC has 7 transactions per second (TPS), #LTC has 56 TPS and #XRB #Nano has 7000 TPS. Do you spot the difference? Now think about price for above coins. #XRB price is currently at $12.60 like LTC year ago.
8781 2018-02-24 19:27:07 Reminds me of Mercedes AMG or Brabus Tuning ;) But in crypto, not a single fork was given...
8782 2018-02-24 19:27:04 Also the kind of followers you have are bcoz of greed but in crypto that greed only for few months a year and than they face the magic rest of the year. Stop being a guru

8802 2018-02-24 19:25:10 Have you been investing in crypto? I wonder if your Airbnb host came away from the convo thinking, "Wow, that Parker guy really understands the tech but doesn't get investing because he hasn't made the same kind of money as me in XRP."
8803 2018-02-24 19:24:56 The term "pre-mined" is the crypto community's colloquialism for the coins pre-allocated to their founders prior to public access, and does not literally imply "mining", even if true.  All popular coins were pre-mined to some degree.  Xrp was entirely pre-mined by this definition

8805 2018-02-24 19:24:43 I thought it was randomly generated in the google server and transmitted to my phone. So are 2FA numbers pre-setted and are already in my phone? I wonder how is that safe...
8806 2018-02-24 19:24:41 As a fellow writer I admire... Do some research?  Crypto isn't a fist currency. It's impossible to be bailed out. Into to crypto podcast or audiobook it. Otherwise your n00b is showing. LOL

8814 2018-02-24 19:23:51 Is that before or after the post fork dump?
8815 2018-02-24 19:23:34 First & Biggest is that your argument lol :) I`m not saying it`s scam or anything what I`m saying is there are other tokens can be used for distance transactions, faster & w lower fees.. Also fractions of currencies were invented in 17th century.

8845 2018-02-24 19:21:09 its a video when someone donates crypto to his stream. hes got bitconnect and rockets and explosions and shit its awesome
8846 2018-02-24 19:21:09 U callled it
8847 2018-02-24 19:21:02 Absolutely agree! It's a normal growth when you provide free advice and lessons while there is a boom in crypto!
8848 2018-02-24 19:20:59 I don't disagree, but for arguements sake, could "long" be a relative term here given the high velocity of the crypto market?
8849 2018-02-24 19:20:55 But then u need to make sure the time is in sync within a certain amount of seconds or auth will fail
8850 2018-02-24 19:20:55 exactly!!

8852 2018-02-24 19:20:39 Lol I haven't yet read everything on that site yet but just cause of the high fees I don't trade long or shorts
8853 2018-02-24 19:20:36 Cryptocurrency ICO is the main selling crypto-coins. This process to some extent can be compared with the IPO (initial public offering), but everything is much easier and confederale that pleases the most part and your purchase will make us stronger!

8872 2018-02-24 19:19:09 That IS a 2FA. I prefer the Authy app tho, easier to backup.
8873 2018-02-24 19:19:00 Why would you pay tax on any crypto period??? It does not belong to any government or any one person.

8881 2018-02-24 19:18:35 I think the time for transparency in crypto is gone in terms of showing people their personal wallets and etc.  Creates a huge target sadly.  It's quite a shame.  It is great for exposure, but more downside risk.  Too many smart guys out there.  Security must rise for mass appeal

8899 2018-02-24 19:17:38 Well, crypto borrowed the concept of market cap from stocks. Currency does not have a market cap. So are you saying we should invent a new definition of market cap for crypto?
8900 2018-02-24 19:17:34 Just like the rest of Socialist California. This is no surprise.
8901 2018-02-24 19:17:26 Something I learned in the 8 months I have invested in $crypto...Nobody is an expert; All are trying to succeed; Most want to help you succeed; Some have ulterior motives....And this is fine with me. Align with people who challenge your thoughts to evaluate many points of view.
8902 2018-02-24 19:17:23 You can buy with Crypto Pro??
8903 2018-02-24 19:17:11 If you can, keep ur 2FA device disconnected from the internet. Use a separate device for it. Shit is getting more dangerous every day. I'm doing the same.

8926 2018-02-24 19:14:34 Venezuelan public institutions don’t even have the technology to implement payments with crypto, imo it’s only a desperate move in order to get attention from the international media, and see if they can attract foreign “investors”, people in Vzla don’t have money to buy cryptos.
8927 2018-02-24 19:14:25 If I meet you and you're a crypto-miner just know I am imagining pouring a whole bottle of soda on your mining rig.

8929 2018-02-24 19:14:14 You guys are educating us, and therefore hurting their profits.  Ideally for them everyone would be FOMOing in , buying high,  selling low.  Good for them in the short term, bad for the crypto economy and future.  P.S.  Don't hack me, I'm still on the FOMO train!

8938 2018-02-24 19:13:14 As I have only .4 ETH I have no reason to worry but am interested to know what is going on! The whole point of #Crypto is no one should have to much power/influence
8939 2018-02-24 19:13:13 $crypto twitter dead... lol correction weekend.
8940 2018-02-24 19:13:11 Oof, I'm guessing a lot of people are on @NvidiaGFN. Frame rate/resolution is terrible. *sigh* Back to me "real" machine with a 680. Crypto really needs to come down a bit; or at least, get farmed some other way. #geforcenow
8941 2018-02-24 19:12:51 Anyone else sell #nano right before the spike 
8942 2018-02-24 19:12:49 CryptoAlerting problem!
Is this diluting pattern of sucker dips catching investors buying on the dip & getting shafted ?

8943 2018-02-24 19:12:43 It’s not the hodling that makes them idiots. There are many that just don’t understand bitcoin and are hoping for free money. $BTC will moon but it has to go through a real bear cycle.
8944 2018-02-24 19:12:34 I'm cool with crypto but damn it's ruined the video card market, these prices are just silly
8945 2018-02-24 19:12:34 But they are the joke of crypto. No offence, but it’s true
8946 2018-02-24 19:12:24 And these are the facts

8961 2018-02-24 19:10:36 Hi there. Do you know why @BittrexExchange is doing this for 1st? Is it cause of the low volume or is there something else behind? I'm really surprised as I think they have the real product already. And I wonder if it could ever go back to a price like 7000 satoshi. Thanks
8962 2018-02-24 19:10:22 Yep..i have been going long on that one even before the invention of #crypto lol.

8976 2018-02-24 19:08:49 @noamlevenson dude, read ur “neo vs ethereum” article on @hackernoon , for a crypto novice like me, it was awesome! Thank you!
8977 2018-02-24 19:08:48 #Crypto tip: When choosing a new exchange, look at that exchange's history: 
- whether it was hacked or involved in controversy, 
- how they reacted to unfortunate events (hacks, crashes etc.).
8978 2018-02-24 19:08:38 There are a few people in the crypto space that I don't always agree with. But damn, they're genuine to a fault, those that don't know these names will soon: @RoadtoRoota @Andy_Hoffman_CG @crypt0snews @derose @Crypto_Daily #followfridayonsaturday

9000 2018-02-24 19:05:48 3 of the people i know irl who ask me about crypto all bought both xrp and trx near tops. i dont get it
9001 2018-02-24 19:05:47 do you enjoy:
eating delivery?
musical chairs?
methamphetamines?

let me tell you about $crypto
9002 2018-02-24 19:05:45 I wanted to add to my wallet, but it looked like I could only do so using various forms of crypto. No "enter your CC # here". Either a fail, or a UI fail. Uses some service that, if it takes money, does so dozens of clicks away from the BAT page. Each click halves your user base.
9003 2018-02-24 19:05:44 Do you own any $ETC? Curious to see the % of $crypto twitter that's in this.
9004 2018-02-24 19:05:30 Currently in crypto space is more lucrative to scam people, rather than be an honest legit business. Check how much @bitconnect earned and how much @coindesk & @CoinMarketCap got paid for BCC ads.
But I'm sure that we can build a system where an honest behavior will be a Nash-eq.

9006 2018-02-24 19:05:22 It’s very interesting to talk to “normal” people about crypto. My AirBnB host this week, a bartender studying to be a physician’s assistant, has been trading. 

Fascinating talking to him about his XRP position, why he bought, & its prospects.
9007 2018-02-24 19:05:22 Specifically Brussels like I mentioned before, yeah
9008 2018-02-24 19:05:11 
9009 2018-02-24 19:04:58 Two mistakes I will never make ( ehem...again): 1) not holding BTC to buy dips, even if my entries seemed great at the time; 2) not taking scheduled profits and predetermined intervals. $crypto
9010 2018-02-24 19:04:56 .. So I'm a bot?

I created this account only to get crypto news and imagine that a lot of people are doing the same
9011 2018-02-24 19:04:49 Agreed 100%. There’s a reason those 5 guys are currently linked to bots. They produce the most quality content crypto traders want. It’s no coincidence that bots are also targeting what the majority likes.
9012 2018-02-24 19:04:47 Maybe by then DRGN will have released the mainnet and be actually able to compete in the blockchain enterprise business

9019 2018-02-24 19:04:03 I think right NOW is the time most will regret not jumping back in, the most sideways action in a desirable buy zone for a while. I think we have one more test of about 9,450 and then we're out of this trend #crypto #bitcoin #ltc #xlm

9036 2018-02-24 19:02:00 not really. Just people still buying the dips. In a bear market you short the bounces. This is new to alot of new traders in crypto

9039 2018-02-24 19:01:37 you really think someone who started 2 months ago has almost as many followers as @CryptoCobain whos been in crypto for years? lolol
9040 2018-02-24 19:01:30 I don't know a lot about TA, but when I look at the $BTC market cycle, 1 or 2 horizontal months seems logical to me. Then I look at the market cycles of those alts...... maybe a huge Alt rally is just around the corner?
9041 2018-02-24 19:01:24 ELA is cheating big time - I know binance and NEO relationship is close- but for the sake of crypto- someone needs to light up the darkness with truth even at the cost of “crypto-pressure”, ELA is cheating, WPR has won, we all know
9042 2018-02-24 19:01:03 I still think we will but I need some fiat for taxes

9044 2018-02-24 19:00:57 Thank you miss
9045 2018-02-24 19:00:41 Keep in mind... some of these companies might be hedging against their crypto holdings (if they’re interested in mitigating risk, that is). There’s now instruments to do this reliably (futures, etc).
9046 2018-02-24 19:00:14 Thanks mate.. xmy received. My crypto collection now xmy xvg btcz bcn .. will keep em growing..
9047 2018-02-24 19:00:09 It is or will be regulated, so it will not be as cheap as it was (lawyers, lawyers, lawyers).
The crypto money are still much smaller than those available on stock markets.
Thus I question "big company"

9056 2018-02-24 18:59:02 This is what both sides don't understand. Crypto is not a #zerosumgame - there will be more than one winner and boatloads of losers. Regardless, if it has utility outside of pump and dump, it'll likely survive. Does this mean #BCash will survive? Time will tell.
9057 2018-02-24 18:58:52 Obviously David had an amazing tweet around the beginning of the year. Maybe a good soup recipe or something.
9058 2018-02-24 18:58:52 So a mandatory draft, i.e. state coercion against non consenting young men to fight peasant farmers in the jungle halfway across the world, should be regarded the same as a sworn, voluntary oath to protect and serve the people of your community.

9067 2018-02-24 18:57:35 Crypto was built as a currency, not an asset. Unless you want your profile to include things like investing in foreign funds (the euro, etc) it should be viewed as a fad.
9068 2018-02-24 18:57:32 Odd when people who invest in something yet ask the most basic questions, do people not even browse the general details of a crypto or heaven forbid read the whitepaper. #crypto #cryptocurrency
9069 2018-02-24 18:57:24 I just invest all my hard earned money in crypto, broke boy today maybe rich boy tomorrow 
9070 2018-02-24 18:57:12 I joined Twitter last month, because it has so much Crypto info.. Its the fastest source of information I have come across. I am very new to this and appreciate all who have helped me learn this other world..
9071 2018-02-24 18:57:05 Yep
9072 2018-02-24 18:57:00 Yes Phil fucked up. Haven't we all said dumb shit in our lives?  Phil apologised, Nik was gracious about the apology and has been exemplary throughout.  Takes a big man to apologise and a bigger one to forgive.
9073 2018-02-24 18:56:53 You're reaching man. Ched posts amazing things and I have learned a great deal from him. Stop the witch hunt and focus on crypto and making money.
9074 2018-02-24 18:56:45 Shame that even in crypto, people try to shame women about their bodies. Do you go up to crypto bros who work out and tell them what to do with their bodies and how to display them? Feminism means allowing every woman to express her femininity the way she wants to.
9075 2018-02-24 18:56:38 Sizce btcnin düşüşü etkilermi
9076 2018-02-24 18:56:31 seviyeye gelebilmektir. herkes buna odaklansa sorun kalmayacak ama çoğu kişi kişilere odaklanıyor. bu tatsızlıklarda seviyede korumaya çalışsak, bildirimi açık olan ve takipçilerin sayfasını gereksiz doldurmuş oluyoruz :(
9077 2018-02-24 18:56:25 I created this account only to learn about crypto, does it make this accout fake because I do not have a bio?
9078 2018-02-24 18:56:21 Big fan, though. They are playing the long game and I think it will work out very well for them; wonder if they’ll do something similar to what Robinhood is doing with crypto.
9079 2018-02-24 18:56:20 I still hold a bit of trx and xvg.. Mostly me being stubborn and not cutting my losses I think lol
9080 2018-02-24 18:56:16 Thank you for your input I appreciate it 
9081 2018-02-24 18:56:07 It’s the cool thing to do now. We want to destroy the guys that; whether you like us or not — are trying to build the community — regardless of how long we have been in “crypto”.
9082 2018-02-24 18:55:41 Listen to this smart Leprechaun!
9083 2018-02-24 18:55:40 #IotaChallenge is still up. $100k to grab from a wallet. We are all desperate waiting for the big winner to grab (steal) the 50Gi. Who will it be?  (Disclaimer: private key "seed" will not be provided up in front )
9084 2018-02-24 18:55:23 Played the game, payed the price.
9085 2018-02-24 18:55:18 that's some good shit!
9086 2018-02-24 18:55:14 Holding ZCL the moment of the snapshot or the fork 2 days later?
9087 2018-02-24 18:55:08 The user interface is ridiculously simple and sexy if I do say so myself. I do have a thing for the neon tron theme. Now as far as crypto, which is the only reason I will be utilizing this app, is not launched yet but you said it was... I'm confused...
9088 2018-02-24 18:54:56 THRONCOIN EXCHANGE IS LIVE!!!! BUY BUY BUY!!! $2.25 AT THE TIME OF THIS TWEET!!
9089 2018-02-24 18:54:54 Unfortunately the TA doesn’t fit with people’s HOPE. Because, let’s face it, that’s all crypto speculation is. Don’t look at TA if you have no faith when it doesn’t support your ‘Hope’ nor rave enthusiastically when it does. #btc
9090 2018-02-24 18:54:47 Why oh why are so many white dudes in crypto dressed like Urban Crocodile Dundee?
9091 2018-02-24 18:54:43 Xvg or trx?
9092 2018-02-24 18:54:42 teşekkür ederim. o değerde görebilmeniz çok güzel. ama sanırım bunun böyle olmasından rahatsızlık duyan arkadaşlar var. kimsenin üstünlüğü yok burada. ben az bilirim siz çok bilirsiniz. önemli olan birbirimizden öğrenebilmek ve para kazanırken kendi kararlarımızı verecek+++
9093 2018-02-24 18:54:37 Wondering why Crypto Platforms use women as the Twitter communications platform. Is it so we don't make harsh criticisms of bad decisions? IJS (not saying any names) #XEM
9094 2018-02-24 18:54:24 I don’t even see actual crypto/blockchain tweets anymore. All I see is..

-Is that “hot girl” a real account?
-People promoting coaching
-Pump and dumps

9102 2018-02-24 18:52:57 Only started using twitter for crypto.  If people spent as much energy on @CryptoChoe @PhilakoneCrypto and @BigCheds content as they do on this ridiculous popularity contest, they'd earn a fortune.
9103 2018-02-24 18:52:48 Yep, that’s the only reason I made this account. Wouldn’t be on twitter if it wasn’t for knowing I need to if I want to gain invaluable knowledge about crypto. Of course since I’ve been on it I have fun with other things besides crypto but crypto is 100% why I made an account.
9104 2018-02-24 18:52:45 Only made my twitter to learn from Choe Phil and Cheds. Thats my crypto only account thats why the Bit in my name

9139 2018-02-24 18:47:47 I really, truly, feel bad for the "Crypto Twitter Experts" who are getting hacked. But general street knowledge is that when you brag publicly about how much money you gettin.... you're just putting a huge target on yourself..... Protect ya neck

9146 2018-02-24 18:47:00 I just sent you both websites as far as knowledge go their website descriptions of their product are extremely similar they are both enterprise blockchain solutions for business using C# and other languages. They might differ a little, but in essence they are the same...

He was probably Nostradamus level foresighted. Just tell me how much Crypto he bought. Should be up there with the Winklevoss brothers.

9197 2018-02-24 18:40:03 @NotJackKemp Should look into using crypto to find your broadcast. Similar to crowd funding but you control distribution of tokens. Waves, Bitshares, there's plenty to choose. don't know the business-tax implications but millenials are migrating away from banks, dyor.

9202 2018-02-24 18:39:46 We won't be able to save that conversion fee in the next few weeks. It'll be April or May on that.

We'll be adding crash avoidance in March. It's up to you, but if you feel crypto will crash again, then you can move it into fiat on Uphold, then get into Heleum whenever.
9203 2018-02-24 18:39:32 Seriously. I don't understand how one of the top platforms in the whole crypto space is not on a high volume exchange.
9204 2018-02-24 18:39:25 All the crypto market needs right now is a tweet from Kylie Jenner saying she invests in crypto. Crypto would be stormi overnight.
9205 2018-02-24 18:39:23 Start thinking about the future return today itself, the smart investors are rapidly joining and investing this project globally. This has a very positive demand in crypto environment.

I’m just starting off in the crypto world I wish I had more to offer him. I hope Phil feels the love. I wish him a speedy recovery

9224 2018-02-24 18:36:29 Donating to a 501(c)(3) charity by far produces the most favorable tax treatment. The contribution would be tax deductible to the donor, plus the appreciation of the asset is tax deferred. Double benefit. Difficulty seems to be finding charities that accept crypto?

9227 2018-02-24 18:36:21 If you look at my profile under my user account on SteemIt, you will see I’ve made over 600$ this year from Results alone. Promoting and kicking back to the roster is how I reward people for role playing. I also reward them I. Crypto currencies like XP Coin and other crypto soon.
9228 2018-02-24 18:36:16 it depends on your risk/reward ratio. In crypto you don't want to set too tight of a stop loss because the wild swings may stop you out. Start looking below previous low to see if it lines up with your risk/reward ratio. You set your stop loss as soon as you enter the trade.
9229 2018-02-24 18:36:16 I only saw the first two episodes but I don't really care about the lead at this point? Also, those Klingons...

9260 2018-02-24 18:31:31 Good looking men and women like to “flash their looks”. This is normal behavior and has nothing to do with crypto or how smart the person is. It doesn’t “reduce” anyone to anything. *You* may reduce good looking people to their looks, but that’s your issue...
9261 2018-02-24 18:31:22 Litecoin is vegeta so best crypto.
9262 2018-02-24 18:31:12 #savedroidICO is an exciting project that can add great value to the crypto community. Hopefully more people invest in this awesome project!

9264 2018-02-24 18:31:11 Robinhood crypto trading is apparently live in five states now, but advertising it as a Coinbase killer is a far cry from the truth. You can't even withdraw crypto, it's like crypto "investing" only for soccer moms and boomers who don't understand the concept of exchanges.
9265 2018-02-24 18:31:02 Can't golf because there is 8" of snow on the ground. Crypto seems uneventful today. What to do???

9272 2018-02-24 18:29:57 One thing I’d like to say what I don’t like about exchanges like #Binance & #Coinbase is that the wallets on these exchanges are not owned by you.  I beleive the #decentralized exchanges are the future where these exchanges don’t hold your crypto ,but you do safety in your wallet

9276 2018-02-24 18:29:12 2 people in as many weeks have told me that >30% of their crypto portfolio allocation was in ICO tokens.

I almost didn't have the heart to tell them that those assets are not legally tradable on any US exchanges. (i.e. *zero* liquidity). Have fun waiting for that buyback, kehd.

9296 2018-02-24 18:26:53 I meant anonymity might increase as log(x) where x = "expense".  Maybe log2(x-1) where x = number of different people you might be and "a" is min # of y-n questions attacker has to answer to identify you. "Crypto" job is to maximize x w/ min computation w/o losing functionality.

9360 2018-02-24 18:15:29 I’ve been getting the weird feeling that the “typical” patterns for months of the year in $Crypto are being pushed out.

9404 2018-02-24 18:10:25 It only takes simple stuff to render a lot of the tech irrelevant. Basic encryption, hacking systems, paying with cash or crypto, kids deciding to talk to each other in real life instead of on their Xboxes.

9451 2018-02-24 18:04:17 All that said the AR has been a slippery fish to nail and back then it was more so. That anyone in ‘16 was slightly off about a definition is no more surprising than anyone in ‘16 being confused about crypto currency.

To pay with $crypto, you (or the business you're shopping with) must pay for internet service.

Thus someone is "paying to pay" for every cryptocurrency transaction. That's a BIG point of failure.

9611 2018-02-24 17:46:46 Isn't crypto regulations synonymous to fake news?

Politicians working in the realm of imposing laws & regulations on Crypto is pointless and shouldn't be alarming when we understand what they don't.

Crypto is Borderless &  Decentralized.  They can only control on & off ramps.

9613 2018-02-24 17:46:39 do you think now is the only time to invest into crypto and possibly see returns of 100x.  Do you think there will be projects in December 2018 that will see big returns in following years?  I don’t have the funds to invest much now but could in future

9628 2018-02-24 17:44:25 I have seen alot of shitcoins since im in crypto, but i have to admit that if you add the community effort to shill the crap out of it and the the campaign to spread misinformation to keep it alive, nothing compares to BTC.

9634 2018-02-24 17:43:45 the problem this time could be that we don't have a higher high. in the circle we had that. But there is still a possibilty for a reverse H&D atm. only time will tell. if that would be the case at 11000ish will happen the break of the neck of big run. will see!!
9635 2018-02-24 17:43:40 Before crypto exploded these highly followed traders bought followers and openly admitted to one day taking your money. This is why I do not mingle with them. They are scammers. They will lead you along for months, then turn on you block and discredit you.

9749 2018-02-24 17:32:13 RT @brunolarvol: Last night, at a #crypto meetup, I suddenly realized I am a #bitcoin #minimalist / #altcoin
9750 2018-02-24 17:32:03 you heard the part where you can't buy bitcoin, only a derivative settled in cash? no crypto in or out...  Kind of defeats the purpose.
9751 2018-02-24 17:31:52 I’ll do a long ass twitter thread for you. Hold up.
9752 2018-02-24 17:31:43 @naval my friend @Charles_Swab assesses that crypto's have been corrupted by WS money and that the wealthiest americans value centralization. they will not take the risk of crypto's that leverage decentralization and conversely choose natl cryptos. thoughts?
9753 2018-02-24 17:31:21 @froshfeel Do you want to break into the scope of the crypto currency and do not know which currency to choose? Pay attention to this project. #Froshfeel
9754 2018-02-24 17:31:18 Or fall to 75k, hit the 55, then bounce like a mofo. #fingersCrossed
9755 2018-02-24 17:31:05 Your favorite crypto twitter trader just got you. He talked shit on your coin. You sold and he bought them. He will soon laugh at you. It’s up to you to learn from this. When was the last coin I shilled? Redd at 8sat? Coval at 49? Know your enemy.
9756 2018-02-24 17:31:02 Girls birthday coming up. Have to cash out some for a present but it’s so hard when Alts are getting cheaper and cheaper, maybe I should buy here a shitcoin bag on the cheap #crypto #alts $btc

9758 2018-02-24 17:30:56 I would value all alts etc in bitcoin most of the time. Just not now (because im bearish)

9789 2018-02-24 17:28:21 It's a stepping stone to get people to spend and replace. You need the merchant's suppliers to start accepting crypto too. That's the next step.

9895 2018-02-24 17:18:32 لا اتفق مع مفهومك للسوفت والهارد ،،، جميعها فروقات برمجية لكن الفرق في عملية انقسام الشبكة والاخرى في تطويعها لتقبل التطوير ،،، يا اعزائي الموضوع لازال جديد حتى ان الجامعات على حد علمي لم تضم تقنية البلوكتشاين في مناهجها ،،، نحتاج التأني في فهمها ،،،
9896 2018-02-24 17:18:25 Thanks, Just the first I heard BCH and I instantly understood which crypto was being mentioned. BCC was very confusing.

9941 2018-02-24 17:14:11 The key to 2018 in #cryptocurrency is to diversify your portfolio if you have the luxury to do so. Find a few #altcoins you love & sprinkle some here & there. I've seen in the past the path to success in this market is to have an open-minded portfolio. #crypto

9952 2018-02-24 17:12:55 Thanks. That prediction alone makes it worth to dabble in. But there are a lot of competitors and I still think crypto needs a much bigger social impact to make the big move and climb. So these underlying fundamental coins will make big swings until then. Marketing will be key!
9953 2018-02-24 17:12:49 انت ايضا اخطأت في حصر مفهوم الفورك بهالشكل ،،، موضوع الفورك ليس بهذه السهولة النقاش فيه لازال emerging ،،، الاولى فقط قول ماهو معلوم فقط وليس حصره بتصور معين ،،،

9969 2018-02-24 17:11:57 That is interesting. I wonder why that is... I think it would be interesting to also measure the crypto-comfort of the people asked. If you ask a bunch of tech bros their comfort with crypto, it'll def be higher than a random sampling across the US of men or women.
9970 2018-02-24 17:11:46 The left shoulder?

9972 2018-02-24 17:11:31 اه هناك فرق بالفعل بين الفورك و الهارد فورك و حتى الصوفت فورك... لكن حتى الهارد فورك ليس هذا هو التعريف الصحيح... الأمر بسيط جدا و لا يتطلب كل هذه التفسيرات. ببساطة شديدة:
الفورك هو الفكرة
الهارد فورك هو تطبيق للفكرة على الاليات
الصوفت فورك هو تطبيق للفكرة على البرامج
9973 2018-02-24 17:11:29 But anyway, dude does need to wake up,  but not sure he wants to hear it.
9974 2018-02-24 17:11:26 Confused as well.  He said "Yes" in response to three people's questions.  It can't be yes to all three.  I'd like to know what he thinks.  Obviously in crypto folks can be wrong.  The key is being right 51% of the time.  Just curious which way he believes we are going from here.

9978 2018-02-24 17:10:50 Eventually people need to become more wise and all theses people/projects need to quit addressing the scamming. Have some common sense people! No one is sending you free crypto because you sent them some.

10000 2018-02-24 17:09:17 To my (less initiated) mind (in the cryptoworld), if the honest objective is just to raise capital (w/o sacrificing control), then crypto bonds (IOUs) make way more sense than these pretend utility and/or payment tokens. But, #regulation.

10032 2018-02-24 17:06:06 Comparing crypto market caps to company market caps make them look overvalued.

Comparing crypto market caps to fiat currency and commodities make crypto look EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED.

Because that's the correct relative valuation.
