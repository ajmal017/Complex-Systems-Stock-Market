5 2018-09-12 23:41:21 Pro tip: Alt coins are not diversification. You want to cross industries that do not correlate with or influence each other. Examples: Tech manufacturing & oil, pharmaceuticals & commodities, food production & real estate trusts, etc.

12 2018-09-12 22:38:56 Algos need virtual commodities like pictures in order to learn. Hence why snapchat had this IPO. Its a commodity mine for tech devs working on facial recognition and deep learning
13 2018-09-12 22:35:05 I think the word “more” is a stretch. I’d say they have just as many questions as a year ago. The known commodities were known a year ago, as were the unknown ones.
14 2018-09-12 22:32:31 Hello lovely twitter friends...including those who work for business news outlets...is there a great commodities expert (gold expert really) who wants to talk gold to an Alaska reporter? Asking for a friend. (actually me).

39 2018-09-12 21:44:55 WHAT IS THE WAR ON DRUGS WORTH WHEN YOU HAVE ENDLESS DEMAND BY ADDICTS AND SECOND/THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WHOS ECONOMIES RUN ON SUCH COMMODITIES AS A LIFELINE. HOW ILLEGAL CAN ONE MAKE MISUSED NATURAL RESOURCES?
40 2018-09-12 21:44:11 How can that be??  This matter should be resolved now!!!
Those bishops, cardinals and priest are living life, enjoying the churches commodities and luxurious life style. #Payback20K to the church. We worked hard to support the church.  Pope Francis do it now!!

Wrong subject bro...and don't hold your breath on those...Drug Frod does not and will never control the price of global goods (maybe exept in is mind and the fools that believe him)
42 2018-09-12 21:22:49 FWIW, the main driver behind that gold run was not the ETF but monetary policy. Similar moves were observed in currencies and other commodities.
43 2018-09-12 21:17:47 Is it possible to Bitmex someday list assets other than crypto using quanto derivatives? I wonder if we will be able to trade stocks/commodities/forex only using bitcoin $BTC #bitmex @BitMEXResearch @CryptoHayes #bitcoin
44 2018-09-12 21:17:21 Sent some commodities
45 2018-09-12 21:17:02 But she's way off on commodities prices!
46 2018-09-12 21:14:16 .@DirectorNCEM Mike Sprayberry: The State Operations Center is moving to a Level 1 activation. We are currently pushing commodities to county partners who need them. We are receiving additional resources that we can use during the response. #FlorenceNC #ncwx
47 2018-09-12 21:08:24 The new iPhone is going to cost $1500 which is just another prime example of how things that start as commodities and evolve into necessities skyrocket in price while forcing people using older models to upgrade through discontinuing service on those models
48 2018-09-12 21:06:40 Jordan Peterson has pretty much advocated women as sexual commodities. he has no credibility as a member of the animal kingdom any longer.
49 2018-09-12 21:00:56 Understanding racism and understanding racism faced by black people are 2 separate commodities. You’re not better placed than me to understand what racism is, I know what it is, sadly; you don’t. As I’ve said before you’re conflating offence with racism. Good day sir.
50 2018-09-12 20:55:26 @VP Excellent news, steel is the hottest of commodities, after all, it builds ....EVERYTHING!
51 2018-09-12 20:52:27 He was best known for founding the commodities company Glencore and for being indicted in the United States on federal charges of tax evasion and making controversial oil deals with Iran during the Iran hostage crisis.
52 2018-09-12 20:47:44 @aliktareen hi Ali, can you inbox your email ? I have a proposal on Agri Commodities trading
53 2018-09-12 20:43:18 Es un escenario muy distinto. La devaluación fue sólo del 30%, no había déficit de cuenta corriente ni hubo crisis cambiaria. Si afectó por el canal comercial (caída de precios commodities+sequía).
54 2018-09-12 20:41:49 In Floyd they were all left behind and drowned. They are living beings not commodities!
55 2018-09-12 20:37:27 Hay que ver bien el cuento “chino”. Muy probablemente es dinero para financiamiento de proyectos petroleros o gas asignados a empresas chinas. La vía de repago? Con crudo,otros commodities no lo veo. Producción petrolera en el piso, - de 700 Mbbld.Muelle de José no disponible
56 2018-09-12 20:35:08 I've literally never been happier in my life to find a jar of creamy peanut butter. This hurricane has made it the rarest a commodities.
57 2018-09-12 20:35:06 1/4 @KennethPGreen, I like your statement on @TheAgenda, "we need to stop underpricing commodities... We need real water.. energy.. transportation pricing..that reflects both the risks..and the value to the consumer, and they can be adjusted in real-time."
58 2018-09-12 20:34:11 I'm starting to have even more respect for those book/movie/TV show characters who are actually going through apocalyptic times and are able to survive without these commodities 
59 2018-09-12 20:33:25 SMA staff members will be attending and presenting at the New Mexico Water and Wastewater Association (NMWWA) Central School in Albuquerque Sept 17-20; come visit our booth and instructors. Water resources are one of our most valuable commodities in the arid southwest. #SMAImpact
60 2018-09-12 20:27:56 90 day black outs, promoting foreign(French) imperialist initiatives and basically handing  the French top commodities and assets that should be for the Cameroonian people.
61 2018-09-12 20:24:58 @IvanDuque lo único que debe demostrar es que puede y es capaz activar una economía basada en commodities, que sea suficientemente sensato para impulsar otros sectores de la economía. @RevistaSemana @ELTIEMPO #Colombia
62 2018-09-12 20:22:07 Also a bullish butterfly pattern...lows are at a 1.27 extension of the last weekly range after a fairly text book ab=cd move down.
Lots of support in lots of areas. Au/$ holding at .71. Is this the hour for commodities?
63 2018-09-12 20:17:44 ADM, the Illinois-based global commodities powerhouse, a major ethanol producer, accounted for roughly 61 percent of the 9.5 million ethanol barrels sold at the Chicago hub between November and August, according to the data reviewed by Reuters.
64 2018-09-12 20:11:35 So those are factors you think may increase the price ? Imagine 500 rwf , on commodities that we can do better, these factors will always be upon us but like I said how prepared are we ? C’mon we are a land of a thousand hills of good soil. There should not be any excuse
65 2018-09-12 20:11:02 I don't know, I think the throwaway has its place. Commodities always existed, but for the things you really care about, buy quality. Buy less, buy handmade, buy local if possible, but above all buy quality. For me, that's the change of mind I've had since making.
66 2018-09-12 20:07:13 A million years ago during my masters work I remember reading an article that used Bordieu and habitus to talk about how The Advocate reframed gay male culture into a set of commodities to be acquired/consumed/displayed.
67 2018-09-12 20:00:58 La Federción Española del Corazón siempre hace plenos con los omega 3 y demás "commodities" de la salud. Es V.I.P. de estos temas comerciales marketinianos.

A la Asociación Española de Pediatría ya se le acusó de baja transparencia y alto conflicto vía @nogracias_eu .
68 2018-09-12 19:58:26 I'd always suggest investing in property, commodities and stock respectively. Most of us can't afford property so the next best thing is commodity stocks and precious metals, as your first personal investment in your early 20s with the little (Cont.)
69 2018-09-12 19:57:49 I think you have this flipped, the cheapness of the value of commodities required to produce a worker in these non-western nations is what causes the cheapness of commodities that get imported here.
70 2018-09-12 19:57:17 Same with schools and libraries. Epa is a government bureaucracy. Created by congress. You should know what you you're talking about when you call things socialism. Government taking private land, commodities and private business for public gain. There you go.
71 2018-09-12 19:55:39 Jeuse you're not bright. Social security is not socialism as its paid into by you and 150 million others! You worked for it! Military and infrastructure aren't close. That's considered public goods. Not commodities. Public goods are non rival and non excludal.
72 2018-09-12 19:54:32 Isn’t the issue that businesses that sell commodities (especially seasonal) cannot compete with Costco, Wal-Mart and Amazon? Salespeople, and taxes (especially in BC) far exceeds robots and the cost of shipping?
73 2018-09-12 19:51:49 Then what is the 16%vat tax imposed on petroleum related commodities for?.2022 campaigns?.
74 2018-09-12 19:48:25 Los K regalaron la guita y se la afanaron en un contexto global de commodities con precio alto y nosotros somos un país agro exportador. Ahora es al revés, el pais está quebrado, con 20 millones que viven del Estado y otros 20 millones de boludos q laburan y pagan sus impuestos.
75 2018-09-12 19:48:19 Well, keep in mind that commodoties and equities are two very different things. The equity markets are more vulnerable to feels. Commodities are more vulnerable to macroeconomic trends
76 2018-09-12 19:39:50 The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as an "immense accumulation of commodities," its unit being a single commodity.

80 2018-09-12 19:32:53 I agree with Majority leader 
@kipmurkomen
 on the need to fund all those expenses.But VAT on petroleum has a huge Multiplier effect on cost other Commodities. 
@SakajaJohnson

83 2018-09-12 19:24:07 We trusted u'll make difference atleast 3-4 years after taking office. 
But even after 4 years, petrol hike,various commodities hike,no increase in tax bracket for working class people is killing middle-class people. 
This is not what we expected. @BJP4India @narendramodi
84 2018-09-12 19:20:26 A commodity market is a market that trades in primary economic sector rather than manufactured products. Hard commodities are mined, such as gold and oil.
85 2018-09-12 19:19:35 #JKLive @KoinangeJeff I don't think paying the 16% VAT on fuel products at the pump is the main pain. The ripple effect of hiked bus fares and higher prices of commodities and services is what pains most of ordinary mwananchi who in one way or another will be pushed to the edge
86 2018-09-12 19:17:56 Peace, cooperation and harmony, are nowhere near as hoardingly profitable as manufactured war, chaos, death, destruction, fear, exploitation and insecurities: all of these commodities are bought and sold in our contemporary unethical global uncivilization.
87 2018-09-12 19:17:04 @Asad_Umar @RazakDawood Decades old policy commodities operation annually burn Billions of rupees tax payers money, neither helped growers nor has yielded any thing for national exchequer but blessed corrupts. We must eliminate support price mechanism.

90 2018-09-12 19:15:06 Mejor estudia un poco de economía y aprende a hacer benchmarks. Los precios no pueden ser inventados por burócratas. Hay muchas referencias internacionales para las commodities y un país normal debería orientarse por ellas.

92 2018-09-12 19:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
93 2018-09-12 19:08:02 O/N Wrap:
Equity markets subdued on a lack of data; #USD slipped, in part due to adverse weather conditions; commodities fared positively, especially oil; #NZD bounced without a test of the waters below 0.6500; #Apple released a slew of more expensive (so, better?) iPhones.
94 2018-09-12 18:57:14 Is to meet every demand of every consumer, which has never happened, and competition beings commodities ever closer to that goal.
95 2018-09-12 18:48:22 We are commodities. #notcitizens
96 2018-09-12 18:48:18 I don't? Gee believe I do. Come from long line of investment bankers (including my ex who worked for both BofA & JPMorgan Chase) commodities brokers (Dad) and virtually every Uncle & cousin. Wall St exploited the situation, decided casino gambling was more profitable, crashed it.
97 2018-09-12 18:45:42 I'm told we're moving into commodities.
98 2018-09-12 18:41:57 Chile invierte un mísero 0,37% del PIB en I+D.  La innovación es uno de los motores de la economía mundial y acá aún no lo entendemos.  Creo en un proyecto regional y país que no dependa de los commodities. Si el pasado nos divide que nos una el futuro. #Chile #Iquique
99 2018-09-12 18:41:31 Commodities and global real estate are consistently missing components within 401k menus. ETFs solve this with broader asset class coverage while avoiding the faux diversification of 100% stock & bond portfolios that MFs exclusively offer.
100 2018-09-12 18:39:58 "Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufacturers flourish: and herein consists the true wealth and prosperity of a state." —Alexander Hamilton (1790)
101 2018-09-12 18:37:55 he is confusing commodities trading with securities trading
102 2018-09-12 18:33:03 The issue concerns valuing them at the point just before they have any monetary value. For commodities, they have a positive value and hence might be exchanged. For fiat tokens, they are worthless... so it isn't obvious how they get of the ground without explicit coordination.
103 2018-09-12 18:32:54 Vitalik is not totally wrong, I’m sure that people will still store some of their wealth in commodities like gold. State central bank run currencies on the other hand...
104 2018-09-12 18:31:12 1. Not yet, but it's the best commodities of the world. Wait for it to become more liquid and have better sellability than the dolar. We'll see bitcoin turn into the world wide coin. Just wait!
2. Agreed.
3. Agreed.
4. Agreed.
5. (adding 1 more) Bitcoin has limited supply.

108 2018-09-12 18:19:39 There’s a woman who commutes on my bus line who looks like @kmakarainen, and every time I see her I have to fight the urge to say she’s a brilliant biathlete. Which she isn’t, because she was on the phone this morning and I now know her name is Paula and she’s in commodities.

116 2018-09-12 17:46:52 The Russians start businesses and front companies and commodities firms that appear legitimate but essentially work to advance the interests of the Russian state. They’re very good at getting people entangled financially and then using that as leverage to get what they want.
117 2018-09-12 17:43:06 How you do you think people become rich? They learn skills, save their wealth, and gain a reputation from working. Rich people fund research for all the commodities we enjoy and money they put in the bank goes to loans for small businesses so they can become rich.
118 2018-09-12 17:36:16 A lot of people getting pregnant that get that monthly check & you know what check I'm talkin about yaunderstan.  I'll save you a phone call/a trip.  YES you still make to much money for Commodities. You literally need 14+ people in the household to MAYBE qualify.

127 2018-09-12 17:21:29 TURNING TO RAGS AND GIVING THE COMMODITIES A RAIN CHECK
128 2018-09-12 17:20:21 I'm inclined to agree, but let me test this a bit by pushing back.  Isn't it a concern that there are other (not quite so) massive markets where this seems to work less well--sectors, continents, countries, currencies, commodities etc.?
129 2018-09-12 17:14:29 Nós atravessamos por um bom tempo uma crise mundial, e mto bem, com essa fórmula de receber recursos das commodities e investir no consumo interno e na industria q gera emprego, deixando o setor de petroleo e gas prontinho pra gerar mais recursos ainda. O problema ñ foi balança.
130 2018-09-12 17:14:24 Só se for de commodities, porque graças ao governo que ele apoia, o do Temer, a indústria, a ciência e a tecnologia estão indo de mal a pior...
131 2018-09-12 17:07:33 Sanghis, I'm going to present a data, read it. this is the price of some commodities when Nehru, great grandpa of Sh Rahul ji was our PM:

Tomato: 20 P/Kg
Potato: 10 P/Kg
Petrol: Rs 1.00 per liter
Gold: Rs 150/10gm
Sex: Free

132 2018-09-12 17:07:11 Those figure probably do not reflect current declines in commodities. So, your probably seeing post Tarrif data and the Fed is live.

136 2018-09-12 16:59:46 Minha opinião pelos 12 anos de um governo de sucesso, trabalhando numa época de alta de commodities, entrando grde volume de recursos pela agropec, é q a fórmula é possivel de fechar se incentivar a economia interna. O q ñ deu certo foi a sabotagem dos ultimos 4 anos.

234 2018-09-12 12:39:27 This dont include losses from the drop in other farm commodities.  Jason Smith says this is Trump country and lots of farmers will still support Trump but when you go to a bank in the 8th District to get a loan they will be short $177 million due to low prices. @JasonSmithMO
235 2018-09-12 12:38:23 because FX, Commodities, Equities are a fucking shark tank? 90% of amateur traders will lose money there. Its a very sophisticated market.

240 2018-09-12 12:34:15 All domestic on net.  The US' trade deficit is being recycled directly into trade goods (commodities, etc.)  But the US' trade deficit is a cute little # compared to the Federal budget deficit.  That wasn't always the case

244 2018-09-12 12:25:10 Gundlach also stated at the beginning of 2018 that commodities were the place to be due to extreme value relative to stocks.  Thus far, he has been dead wrong.  He has been wrong on bond yield forecasts as well.  Gundlach is treated as a guru but in reality is just noise.
245 2018-09-12 12:20:12 O governo do PT viveu de commodities,enquanto a China esbanjava dinheiro, quando os  chineses fecharam a torneira...

The I expect Modiji import petrol and diesel from Pakistan to sell here at cheap price. 
Thank you bhakt for info.
 Jai Modi ji.

255 2018-09-12 11:55:09 Why don’t y’all just change the system to vote with $$$?  Allow as many votes as you want.  1st vote =$1.  2nd vote = $5.  3rd vote = $20.  Also, citizens can sell their vote(s) on a commodities type market.
256 2018-09-12 11:54:19 How , the rich travel more secondly , we talk about increase in prices,money doesn’t grow on tree nor  any politician brings it from his home,ultimately it is charged to public on one or the other product this time it is petrol in your Govt rule it was pulses & other commodities
257 2018-09-12 11:49:42 We lack the technology and infrastrure. Have you seen Indian roads? Can public charging pods survive those? We don't even have proper parking in Indian cities. Parking cost alone could be used to recover fuel price. I am against using imported commodities as tax source.
258 2018-09-12 11:35:25 Siempre y cuando no suba SAN DÓLAR y no bajen los precios de los commodities que exportamos.
Dependemos mucho de la suerte.
259 2018-09-12 11:34:11 Ppl have been brainwashed into viewing certain animals as companions and others as commodities. Worth (in this case: right to life) isn’t determined by intelligence or ability to love.
260 2018-09-12 11:31:36 maize flour and wheat flour have been moved from zero rated to exempt, even without taking into account the VAT on fuel, the price of these commodities is made to go up
261 2018-09-12 11:29:53 Yup. I feel REER is genuinely misleading when it comes to trade competitiveness, because pricing and settlement of most commodities (most significantly oil) depend on USD/INR real exchangr rate rather than bilateral rates.
262 2018-09-12 11:18:33 France - the Agriculture Ministry stated in its first harvest projection that #sugar #beet output should drop 11.1% in 2018/19, to 41.12 mln tonnes, due to heat and drought. Average beet yield seen falling 10.6% on the year to 85.07 tonnes/ha. #commodities #production
263 2018-09-12 11:14:54 The framework provides UK public sector organisations with a way to buy cloud-based services as commodities to accelerate cloud adoption in a timely and cost-effective manner.
264 2018-09-12 11:11:58 Mauritius - The Chamber of Agriculture reduced the #sugar output forecast in 2018 by 5.7%, to 330,000 tonnes from their May forecast of 350,000, in response to low prices. #commodities #production
265 2018-09-12 11:06:38 It's often said access to cheap commodities for the average working class westerner (and increasingly, East Asia) is proof that capitalism is doing fine - unsurprisingly, it isn't really
266 2018-09-12 11:04:53 Its like if moses kuria has not understood taxable and non taxable commodities
267 2018-09-12 11:03:35 ...or that the poorest of Canadians have to spend more on basic commodities like milk and eggs.  Not very progressive.
268 2018-09-12 10:54:34 ang hirap ng sitwasyon ng Pilipinas. may super typhoon sa bansa, tapos may rice shortage, problema sa NFA, mahal na commodities -- pahirapan sa relief goods. tapos 'tong mga 'to, suspension lang iniisip. inevitable yung bagyo, pero maging considerate naman tayo. hindi lahat safe.
269 2018-09-12 10:53:56 I don't really trade Commodities but it'd be interesting to look at the Copper futures before negotiating. If China slowdown is genuinely here prices going one way....and not up.
270 2018-09-12 10:41:34 @DungeyLee @ReadingThePlay I can not be clearer about this. Peachey NOT coming to the GC in 2018 will be a win for our team. He’s definitely a good player but he does not bring toughness, professionalism or grit and they’re the three commodities we most need.
271 2018-09-12 10:32:25 Sugar is probably one of the few commodities where the input & output prices are fixed by the Govt In the old days they used to run extra shift without paying any taxes or giving to the pool & sell it unblock market  But black market doesn't exist Only was they can make money is
272 2018-09-12 10:24:01 Jumping into any market without experience and trying to score big by holding for a few weeks and selling is a SURE PATH TO RUIN trading Bitcoin, stocks, foreign currencies, commodities, metals, you name it. The problem isn't Bitcoin, it is lack of education, impatience, greed.
273 2018-09-12 10:13:17 When BJP is in power riots dont happen. So why does it happen when they r in opposition ?THINK. Demonetisation hit d common man hard. Prices of daily commodities r sky rocketting. Foreign policy is in dumps. Rupee has crashed. Exports hv dwindled. Which results r U talking about?
274 2018-09-12 10:04:50 Fuel is among the most important commodities in the citizens’ life,  it's linked to other commodities. Hence, it's important for the public to monitor the prices of fuel. the taxes imposed on the fuel sector in Palestine, constitute a main financial source to the Treasury
275 2018-09-12 09:58:37 When Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee accorded freedom to OMCs to price their fossil fuels at globally benchmarked purchase price, it was a landmark economic reform. 

You lack rudimentary knowledge of economics. Imported commodities must be priced at globally benchmarked..

276 2018-09-12 09:49:05 Mate, the exported earning from value added commodities & our political conjuncture is a testimony for the failure of #DS.

277 2018-09-12 09:39:24 doing a lot of commodities reporting out there, Martin?
278 2018-09-12 09:33:00 Even if how good story may we provide, the alarming rate of increase in petrol prices is directly affecting the prices of daily commodities. @narendramodi @PMOIndia
279 2018-09-12 09:27:30 This genius thinks petroleum cost doesn't affect commodities
280 2018-09-12 09:27:10 They’re fake bot accounts that try to rope women into a “relationship” and then bleed them of their cash or other commodities. Block and report these creeps as person pretending to be me or someone else and type “bot account” into the someone else space on the twitter report.
281 2018-09-12 09:26:37 All commodities are down in 2018... and all will swing higher with the next cycle. In AUD.
282 2018-09-12 09:23:57 Worldwide Market forces & international Currency Movements determine the price of traded commodities such as Oil or Gold. If India wants to be a superpower, then it cant be immune to price fluctuations. Nothing is free or subsidised except in India. It is a pure fantasy to fix it
283 2018-09-12 09:22:12 Now for you to use a national replica Jersy you need what is called authorisation consent letter, for Villa it was given to Lusaka commodities which is no longer part of Villa, those guys are lost
284 2018-09-12 09:19:18 I foresee less traffic on our roads and more embrace on public transport.Maybe this was a smart way to decongest our roads and city..Now what you need is zero-rate on all taxes on basic commodities.Also reduce our governance system and close all corruption loopholes.Kenya's rise.
285 2018-09-12 09:11:15 whats so ugly is how  is just treating all of them like they’re pawns and commodities they can use for profit instead of people, this event is supposed to be his but theyre just treating it this way..why do we expect them to do it for anything other than for monetary gain..
286 2018-09-12 09:09:28 Its not just about the petrol prices the tweet was just a joke clearly.. But the prices of commodities in general have maintained rather than increasing.. And that's the most positive sign right now...

288 2018-09-12 08:52:27 Only cheap commodities attract many buyers fam
289 2018-09-12 08:50:43 Another thing instead of impacting16% tax on fuel only thus causing price rise on other  commodities making life hard for a noble man this tax should  be spreaded to ease the pressure
290 2018-09-12 08:49:48 I'm listening to Moses Kuria and wondering if his brain committed suicide or something . Saying that increasing the price of fuel has no effect on the price of other commodities like cereals, and he claims he's an expert on taxation. What grade did he score?
291 2018-09-12 08:45:52 So increasing the GST rates of many essential commodities or the Income tax for the middle class to compensate this will be ok for you?
292 2018-09-12 08:43:56 Yes we understand that. But do you also understand the fact that the cost of transportation affects commodities prices? Truth and Reality are two different things. Truth-Floor and Maize-zero-rated. Reality-Prices will increase.  "Moses Kuria"
293 2018-09-12 08:41:45 what is impact of fuel price increase on essential commodities?
294 2018-09-12 08:39:21 Have you seen price other commodities like onion,tomato dal and other 100 of items, Whose price was touching sky during UPA period. Have you idiot forgotten this? Also forgotten Oil bond was taken by UPA.
295 2018-09-12 08:38:45 As an accountant!!!so fuel prices doesn't affect prices of other commodities? 
I see you both went to the same Panjama college kabogo went...respect accountants...
296 2018-09-12 08:22:11 The millers of Kenya have indicated that from next week they will factor in the 16%VAT on their operations, directly affecting the prices of basic commodities like unga. It will be very hard for Kenyans to carry the burden of jubilee's wanton  borrowing...
297 2018-09-12 08:15:43 soaring high prices of basic commodities, like rice and shortage of rice due to rice cartel and Hoarding and government not arresting the rice cartel and smuggler where is the Pagbabago?
298 2018-09-12 08:13:08 Oil is having some trouble above the $70 a barrel level. With the API showing another large decline in inventories and Hurricane Florence inbound this could chance.

299 2018-09-12 08:12:51 Think I’ll avoid purchasing anything from an American corporation, until you stop your Government killing people all over the World to steal their commodities. 25 million since WW2 incidentally.
300 2018-09-12 08:05:21 It’s obvious that the higher prices of fuel (due to new taxation) will translate into higher costs of maize and wheat flour that may Kenyans consume almost daily even if there is no direct VAT on the two vital commodities. @HonMoses_Kuria
301 2018-09-12 08:04:25 POLITICS FAIL IF ECONOMY FAILS!  You can't twist facts and real scenario with lies and propaganda!

302 2018-09-12 08:03:12 Yes it is the bitter pill but Moses also lied that manufacturers of the basic commodities can claim a refund?
303 2018-09-12 08:01:14 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
304 2018-09-12 07:56:30 #DelhiHC refuses to issue any direction on a petition filed by Pooja Mahajan seeking fixation of Petrol & Diesel Prices under the Essential Commodities Act, saying it cannot interfere in Government’s policy making decisions.
305 2018-09-12 07:55:04 Agaba through his best friend Nakamanya wanted to kill my business, they think making a name and Business in more than 6 foreign countries is easy, they wrote to URA that i don't pay taxes, and i should be investigated Lusaka commodities is in SADC countries, fake people

309 2018-09-12 07:44:12 Is it better to pay more for fuel or for other important daily commodities? Ans this first. Inspite of rising fuel the inflation is in check only coz of other commodities being available at a reasonable rate. This was the reason why the bandh was a flop show coz it was illogical
310 2018-09-12 07:44:00 Sir yeh saare supporters cycle wallen hi hain. Par inn chutiyon ko yeh nahi pata ki fuel rise se daily commodities bhi mehngi hone shuru ho gay hain.
311 2018-09-12 07:43:38 I’m a daytrader google it. But I know some horny financial advisors that know the value of commodities. Do u know what a commodity is?
312 2018-09-12 07:43:00 Cost of commodities that appeared unthinkable but kenyans got used to them
1.Milk - from Ksh 23 to Ksh 50 
2.Bread - from Ksh 22 to kshs 50 
3. 2Kg sugar - from ksh 105 to ksh 270

There will be a hike in wheat prices in 2019 due to extreme weather conditions..
Soft commodities are great to look at from now.

316 2018-09-12 07:17:15 Some other points put forward by bhakts : 
1. Prices of other commodities have come down so don't complain for petrol price.
2. Fiscal deficit has been brought down.
317 2018-09-12 07:07:59 tienes razón, tenía que haber indicado mejor recursos naturales igual que en el título, disculpas... como para los chinos cualquier cosa son commodities ;-)
318 2018-09-12 06:58:30 If turkanas now know the importance of having a oil refinery in Kenya while moses kuria is telling us increase of fuel prices does not mean increase of other commodities I asked myself why  do we still spend so much on education
319 2018-09-12 06:52:51 Inspite of petrol/diesel prices being at an all-time high, prices of essential commodities are under control. Food inflation is at all-time low....And how much petrol / diesel does the common man use every month for commuting anyways? Common sense it would be marginal
320 2018-09-12 06:52:01 Eh, need to trade in local commodities. I think a certain video would suffice.
321 2018-09-12 06:47:22 idiot. if ur comparing the increase price of onion during Pnoys time vs the increase prices of ALL commodities, aba eh #MochangTanga ka na nyan. 
322 2018-09-12 06:46:54 For sure. Don't mean to dwell on the past either, just a parallel to commodities investing now, which is down in the dumps much the way real estate was in 2012.

It's easy to psyche yourself out in a buyer's market; just saying when world class tier 1 is cheap, don't overthink.
323 2018-09-12 06:41:04 Ha this 5,000 @LaptopMechanic sent me was for a Laptop I bought in 2013 for 82k, the thing spoilt in 2014 and nobody was able to fix it because it was Nigerian product “BRIAN”. sometimes trying local commodities isn’t safe here. HP i bought since then still has 5hrs battery life.
324 2018-09-12 06:39:19 In a new proposed financial bill the rise of fuel will not affect basic commodities like the previous one,whos got sand in the brains now?

326 2018-09-12 06:35:25 @narendramodi  India being signatory to WTO, cannot put blanket ban on imports. But I have a solution in my mind to tackle this problem where we can curb imports of non-essential commodities without defying any trade related framework as prescribed under the WTO.
327 2018-09-12 06:33:12 So the church business is all about predators calling themselves as the communion between God and the believer, force lecherous acts on their victims. When caught, their supreme Pontiff will exonerate them! Do these apostles of church think that women are sexual commodities?
328 2018-09-12 06:31:11 Before,they used to merge basic commodities n fuel in taxation because at that time basic commodities were taxed thus why the raise in fuel affected the agriculture industry and it was a huge burden but now they've separated it and zero rating the same commodities.

331 2018-09-12 06:22:03 @narendramodi  Due to curbing liberal import of non-essential commodities,
depreciation of rupee can be arrested.
332 2018-09-12 06:22:03 USA The best horse in a very weak field .. Dax is close to 2016 levels Euro-Stoxx (sorry the word) looks like shit .. Asia/ China is trading 52 week lows ... USD Apple and Amazon the ultimate safety trades I got laughed at 8 months ago ... When long commodities was a thing ..
333 2018-09-12 06:16:27 @wilsonnjoroge no he wasnt. He lied that manufacturers of basic commodities such as unga can claim VAT tax. Treasury changed VAT status of these commodities from zero rate to exempt. Effectively means no such claims can be made further. Price of unga wil rise soon

336 2018-09-12 06:15:30 High price for essential commodities is dangerous for any economy. BJP had this gyan before 2014 remember? What changed bro?

338 2018-09-12 06:12:13 This event is what got me interested in investing. Started with $2,000 CAD and bought some commodities, then stocks, then crypto from 2013. Last December I bought a new house with profits, fully paid. 

If I was just starting now, I'd go straight to BTC, then ETH, EOS and IOTA.
339 2018-09-12 06:09:41 Yesterday you were visibly drunk on live television hence impaired thinking. How can you not comprehend that increase in fuel price will ripple effects on other commodities. Thats why you termed as a failure. I pity us kenyans when we listen to you so called "leaders"
340 2018-09-12 06:09:37 I am trained economist. One of main factors affecting prices of commodities is cost of production. If 16% VAT on fuel remains, cost of production goes up. Manufacturers pass this to consumers. Thats how these things work
341 2018-09-12 06:08:29 Prophet of Doom. You're always happy when Boko haram strikes, when bandits strike, when train derails or breakdowns, now when there is hike commodities price. Why negativities? Is that patriotism?
342 2018-09-12 06:06:49 Brother. Except petrol and diesel all commodities are cheaper. Please go through the dynamics of oils central taxes . The taxes collected by central  government is passed on to state 42% & centre 58%. Thus state are getting this revenue over and above their VAT.
343 2018-09-12 06:06:35 Kindly update. Recently, treasury changed VAT status of basic commodities such maize from zero rated to exemption in 2018/19 budget. That means manufacturers cannot claim back this tax. Kuria lied on tv yesterday. It means this cost wil b passed to consumers thru high prices
344 2018-09-12 06:03:32 U want your salary to be doubled at least in every 3rd year but the price of commodities should remain the same as your father's time?
345 2018-09-12 05:57:38 Sir agreed But the etrol prices linked to increase in other commodities which effects roughly 15% of expenses
Pls calculate milk,tea,coffee

346 2018-09-12 05:51:45 Our government, especially Theresa May and her husband, along with Blair and his supporters from both sides. The USA, ISRAEL, and their ilk, ALL NEED TO BE TRIED FOR WAR CRIMES  AGAINST ALL HUMANITY. They have committed these crimes across the globe for oil and other commodities.
347 2018-09-12 05:45:42 They pay their own taxes. If they paid US taxes, the median income is so low that they would all either not pay any or get everything back. It's a zero sum argument.
They also have to pay double tariffs on all imports they receive. 
They pay Import/export taxes, commodities taxes
348 2018-09-12 05:44:12 Humans being commodities.  Did our Creator ever say that?
349 2018-09-12 05:42:43 People solve people's problems. Not philosophies, beasts, machines, tools, commodities, or any item of whatever sort.
350 2018-09-12 05:24:07 This reasons his giving cannot hold water. Raising the cost of production through the increase of fuel prices directly translates to higher pricing of commodities .
351 2018-09-12 05:21:09 Public gave big response to the Bharat band being fed with the price rise of petrol n other commodities during the regime of BJP govt. But BJP has refused to cut its taxes on petrol hence public will.have to suffer the burden of failures of BJP result public will reject in 2019

367 2018-09-12 04:27:10 Prices of other essential commodities like dal, etc. too have come down compared to UPA rule. Why not appreciate the fact that the government has no control over fuel prices? Whatever is within its control, it has delivered results.
368 2018-09-12 04:26:36 Moses Kuria displayed the highest level of ignorance in Jubilee. He insisted that "maize flour and sheet flour were zero-rated" and not taxable. He doesn't know that the same government he is in moved the said commodities from "zero-rated" to "VAT-exempt".

371 2018-09-12 04:21:32 I must say that we are wrongly comparing the "expenses" of petrol. Don't forget that rising petrol and diesel prices along with a falling rupee will make things worse because automatically prices of general commodities will increase.

378 2018-09-12 04:08:42 Good one Rishi. At the same time dada, rise in fuel cost leads to increase in the prices of other commodities. They may or may not  affect in actuality. But vendor will misuse the sentiment and jack the prices. Actual pain lies here. We need to address that too in our messages.

395 2018-09-12 03:08:36 The genius of Indian analysts never fails to amaze. In commodities where domestic markets are totally ring fenced, protected by tariffs, import ban and/or floor price,  they play manic trackers of global trends.

403 2018-09-12 02:27:07 Lula's govt was the beneficiary of a now ended commodities's boom, even if he had stayed in power, he probably would have been forced to cut back. If the main criteria for "success" is lifting people from poverty, no one has come close to the record of the CPC over last 30 yrs.

408 2018-09-12 02:03:36 As the price of international commodities is low, the difficulties of the emerging economies will be expected in the future. However, we do not think that trade wars need to respond greatly to demand fluctuation rather than a drop in demand.
