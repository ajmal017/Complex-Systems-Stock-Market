10 2018-10-20 22:45:19 Sanitary pads shd be tax free - probably but i think d way to go will be to look for appropriate technology thats affordable in d spirit of self reliance and self determination. Govt shd rather make d life saving commodities free ..women r dying at childbirth
11 2018-10-20 22:44:53 What do you mean extra special tax? Companies that produce Sanitary pads are taxed, as are other commodities.

14 2018-10-20 22:37:24 I think pads should be cheap but this is strictly on an argument based on pathos (emotions)

But if we are being realistic, government subsidize commodities based on their direct economic implications.

So, it is highly unlikely for any government to subsidize items like pads

38 2018-10-20 21:53:24 leaving bonds, stocks will have to go somewhere, into commodities, hard asset - gold. But by then it'll be priced out of reach get it now while cheap. Not to say have everything in gold, at least a portion. Land, silver, a hard asset with no 3rd party liability.
39 2018-10-20 21:14:10 In a family, If two members are working, they are paying taxes, SSN, they will car's, child education, daily commodities spending expenses will increase, they can start own business, able to buy houses, indirectly creating more job's in other sectors too 1/2
40 2018-10-20 21:13:34 It's a good idea, but ultimately it will also fail. When commodities are controlled by a capitalist class, they will always find a way to infect government. They have the power, and they will use it. Higher taxes are only a bandaid.

49 2018-10-20 19:57:20 Thanks. Perhaps deflation threat could be partially addressed by commodities becoming more costly after many years of commodity price declines?
50 2018-10-20 19:56:11 How are you planning on going about when committing to commodities such as gold and silver? Is it through investing in funds, or physically for example? What are your thoughts?
51 2018-10-20 19:55:01 The Us dollar used to be tied to Gold. Nixon took Us off the Gold standard. It then allowed unlimited money printing. As long as commodities like oil increased exponentially. Every monetary crisis is created in oil prices. Depression of wages& commodities  = lower inflation.

59 2018-10-20 18:53:02 I'm not invested in the stock market. And just maybe they have information on someone else they are interested in. And the only real part of the stock market I pay attention to is the commodities

Short-term likely will be chaos in commodities markets, but mainly bc Govs/States interfere heavily in supply & demand mechanisms.
The root problem is the coercion-based system - all Govs/States via Enforcers.

And the gas savings are worth it, frankly.
74 2018-10-20 17:51:23 Except with respect to commodities that have future/long term or indirect costs or difficult to quantify costs..  Tobacco is an example. Fossil fuels another.
75 2018-10-20 17:46:43 Russia and China have been working on similar things for ages. But most international trade used to be in dollars (say China-Indochina trade). You have to have or build reserves of $). And currencies are different from commodities.

79 2018-10-20 17:34:11 Yeah joined CT at that time. Been trading commodities much longer than that. Junior resource miners, etc.... humility please, random CT guy
80 2018-10-20 17:28:29 53% del gas natural y 90% del petróleo que consumimos es importado. Debemos comprar fuera y el traslado de esos insumos también es costoso (Altas montañas que sortear y un gran mar que navegar) eso encarece todo, ya que todo lo consumido depende de estos commodities.
81 2018-10-20 17:24:28 Another addendum was that commodities markets weren't looking good when the project ground to a halt and I'd guess that the ones still affected for export via the bridge don't make much money for Russia/aren't a budget priority with oil revenues, so there are other causal factors
82 2018-10-20 17:23:32 Do soldiers buy with the same price ..we buy these commodities if so then i wonder
83 2018-10-20 17:23:21 6° economia por causa das altas da commodities, aumentar R$ 5,00 no bolsa família não é uma ascensão social. O ladrão não fez uma obra de infraestrutura, as que o Brasil tem ainda são do tempo do Regime militar. 46% dos brasileiros não tem saneamento básico.
84 2018-10-20 17:17:12 Uma das maiores fake news, no Brasil, foi 
" o PT quebrou o país!"

Quando o correto seria
-Durante o gov. do PT, aconteceu uma Crise Econômica MUNDIAL. Atingindo a economia d diversos países pelo mundo. Afetando o preço das commodities e refletindo na dívida pública dos países.
85 2018-10-20 17:08:46 It’s not about where I live. Wages are averaging 2.7% and we know where inflation is. So that’s not a big difference. Through in health care and now I’m in the negative let alone all the other commodities.
86 2018-10-20 17:04:40 IMF loan and subsidized housing are two opposites.
removing subsidy from public transport and subsidized homes are opposite
increasing gas, oil prices , which result in increased price of commodities and groceries and talking of poor are opposite

92 2018-10-20 16:30:17 Commodities must have some intrinsic value though. Gold is pretty and a decent electrical conductor, what does bitcoin do?

94 2018-10-20 16:28:17 Why would then every single country starts to legalize it and implement regulations? EY should focus on some other studies such as unwed investments or commodities where people lost huge amounts of money!
95 2018-10-20 16:12:38 Isnt revenue from the 2% tax, since it will come in RTGS form, losing value already as prices of commodities are rising? By the time we realise that the revenue has been eroded by inflation will we not wish we had pegged a rate of conversion for all RTGS to USD and dollarised?

123 2018-10-20 13:38:54 Up means commodities are valued higher vs equities. The internet bubble made equities soar so commodities looked cheap. During the financial crisis people sell their equities and move into commodities like gold
124 2018-10-20 13:36:42 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
125 2018-10-20 13:34:10 Pussy overrated & plentiful ... on the commodities chart ... that means .... its in low demand. #Game 
126 2018-10-20 13:31:50 True enough my bro. I would even say that even the political engagement of persuasion is violent in that it sees human beings as commodities to be used and not communities to loved. When will politics engage itself from the eyes of the disenfranchised? We can only hope.
127 2018-10-20 13:26:04 Instead of telling this plz inform us any single concrete step taken by the govt to ease the life of poor, middle and lower middle class?rather these people have screwed by ending subsidies on electricity water gas and petrol including daily commodities
128 2018-10-20 13:05:03 3230: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
129 2018-10-20 12:51:14 Plain truth, if they ask you, how much was rice, petrol,etc before apc come, ask them the prices of commodities when they took over from abacha or abdulsalaam......
Bunch of unrepentant looters
130 2018-10-20 12:49:25 From that review: Erica's book follows a recent spate of publications that have focussed on essential commodities in the world of food: Sydney Mintz’s Sweetness & Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History, and Mark Kurlansky’s Salt: A World History : commodity’s history
131 2018-10-20 12:20:58 Still Modi not yet attained manhood. His administration skills have spelled disaster to Indian economy with skyrocketing fuel prices, gas, commodities
132 2018-10-20 12:03:38 It won't fail.. Using talent who are known commodities that you've invested in for years makes sense. The matches on the PPV actually look good.
133 2018-10-20 11:38:27 That suffering then can never be compared to this present  situations we are in today, what affects families today is food, housing , clothes and Education, the cost of these commodities/services today are above what even a middle class family can comfortably afford.

137 2018-10-20 11:22:20 yup, well, the SAD is designed to promote commodities based agriculture. it was only a matter of time until it ate itself alive.
138 2018-10-20 11:14:39 tangna puro inflation na lang ng mga products or commodities.. tangna sana mag inflate din naman ang sweldo.. kung mag rerekwes kayo para isabatas ang dagdag sweldo eh gawin naman para sa pangkalahatan kumbaga kahit dun sa mga 20k below salary.. tssss

141 2018-10-20 10:45:07 The biggest scam is buying depreciating assets with your hard earned money.

400 years ago people splurged on gemstones, jewellery & commodities.

And people say a watch is a bad investment while you're spending your hard earned money on coffees, make up & games
142 2018-10-20 10:30:50 It's obvious that manners is one of the most scarce commodities in your village....wait till 2019 then you can vote, don't come here and type whatever daft think that flows through your head ...
143 2018-10-20 10:18:13 Some airlines still accepting RTGS/Swipe. Swipe $300 return ticket to Dubai with @FlyRwandAir. No loss to airline. They get forex from @ReserveBankZIM at 1:1. But it's a huge blow to forex reserve.  Why subsidize air travel when you can't import basic commodities @MthuliNcube
144 2018-10-20 10:03:47 Capitalism is religion. Banks are churches. Bankers are priests. Wealth is heaven. Poverty is hell. Rich people are saints. Poor people are sinners. Commodities are blessings. Money is GOD.
145 2018-10-20 09:19:42 Taking into consideration that inflation rate and prices of commodities in d market, N40,000 should be d last resort ..N50,000 is my stand.
146 2018-10-20 09:08:30 Seen as commodities nothing more. Such a shame..
147 2018-10-20 08:59:46 Tough question! But let's see if I can connect some dots. Ah, is this person connected in any way to trading commodities and doing well at it?!

149 2018-10-20 08:48:26 The sanctuary is currently for the beluga whales, from China. Also LP have no intention of releasing Morgan or her calf, both are valuable commodities who bring in a huge amount of money for the 'owners'.
150 2018-10-20 08:37:31 Say that again, but please don't exclude gals. Most guys walk around bare chested some have breast close to that of females, but gals seem to use their breast as a tool for bargain, always shielding it when guys are around. Protecting it with a bra like the other commodities
151 2018-10-20 08:37:06 The irony is that the term began with Farage, the son of a stockbroker who was privately educated and then became a commodities broker in the city before making himself very wealthy at the expense of the tax payer but who definitely isn’t one of the metropolitan elite
152 2018-10-20 08:23:30 I trully believe mean good for Zim but if you fail to address the innediate challenges the general public is facing like cash shortages, pararell market, basic commodities shortages in the short term your plans will be having serious gaps and society will judge you.
153 2018-10-20 08:18:28 Notice how essentials like food and energy costs are rapidly rising? That is the first sign of high inflation arriving. Stock up on commodities, food stuff like rice, dried beans, etc. If possible save precious metals for money. Paper money & bank deposits will lose value quickly
154 2018-10-20 08:01:52 We would be fearing for our lives in addition to starving. He would force price controls that result in shortages (I think it's better to have the commodities at high prices than not having them at all), yall forgotten the empty shops? Going to Mozambique. No guys
155 2018-10-20 07:40:28 Silvano, estude sobre o Gramscismo. Quando acabam os commodities, quando acaba o dinheiro, acaba o "socialismo do bem". É uma questão de tempo. Não existe almoço grátis. O socialismo não funciona infelizmente. Aconteceu em Cuba, acontece na Venezuela, acontecerá no Brasil. #PTNao
156 2018-10-20 07:38:42 Chinese buyers want to buy global commodities apart from US commodities and US farm leaders are telling US farmers China needs their produce and will keep buying. Clearly the Chinese are on the front foot so far.
157 2018-10-20 07:34:32 Could make it illegal for institutional investors to buy China issued bonds, govts or OTW. Ring-fence China so their collapse does less damage.

Let the exporters who got themselves dependent on selling commodities to China crash, figure out another business model.
158 2018-10-20 07:25:50 We paid 97 per liter, bought commodities at good prices. What befell us under APC is fraud
159 2018-10-20 07:25:31 Maybe someone should explain Polanyi’s Substantivism to Jason Kenny? Haha, just kidding, Kenny likes his economics and commodities like he likes his politics and his image: fetishized.

163 2018-10-20 07:03:26 Bread is now at $1.20 and other basic commodities still out of reach. What is the government doing about it?? @nickmangwana @matigary @KMutisi
164 2018-10-20 06:45:25 You mentioned LP supporters, and honestly, yes. The ones who are rallying against the current administration are pro-Filipino. Ever checked the prices of goods yet? Maybe you're rich and fortunately, you don't have to suffer from the hike in the prices of goods and commodities.
165 2018-10-20 06:32:42 I drink water and beer when it suits me. But let all commodities be available and affordable to all and sundry
166 2018-10-20 06:21:09 The price of fuel went up..commodities went up..she could no longer afford to spare..it's not bullshit life is hard out here..people are living shilling to shilling ..you might not understand but empathize
167 2018-10-20 06:10:53 No my friend I don't want any subsidiary in public transport please read my thread carefully. All Im saying is that if govt doesn't control petrol/ diesel prices prices of essential commodities will keep rising. (1/2)
168 2018-10-20 06:08:25 There are so many people in Pakistan who earn off the changes of Oil Prices and other commodities, our people rush to call that "haram ki kamayi" and when you want to explain it to them they don't want to listen there is no-self-motivation to educate oneself. 2/2

171 2018-10-20 06:01:58 Single, basket or truckload of commodities makes no difference. Will fail & why do it? What advantage does it bring other than to the owners of the commodities? Really bad retrograde step we don’t want to re-live.
172 2018-10-20 05:57:30 I have always been a proponent of a free market economy, a capitalist economy, in which the forces of demand and supply are sole determinant of prevailing prices of commodities, salaries and wages not left aside.

178 2018-10-20 04:24:58 Sir,you mean to say thank before Modi Government , there was nice Governenc and prices of all commodities were under control.
Weaker section of the society were safe .
Minority class were happy .
What a miraculous Government, we lost ?
179 2018-10-20 04:14:40 I think everything is there for anyone to see that the country is burning Mr President. Prices of basic commodities have gone up there is no fuel, foreign currency shortages yet u want us to believe all is well.
180 2018-10-20 04:11:30 "Jharkhand has most mining industries" -- exactly what i am saying. Thay states like jharkhand r exploited. Where is the manufacturing ? Mining is not manufacturing. Its just like Africa or latin america. Exports commodities & imports Finished goods. 

Just like Indo china trade.
181 2018-10-20 04:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
182 2018-10-20 03:51:48 Collectivization of piblic goods and commodities is what we talk about not personal property. Of course unless we are talking about tribalism or a small commune collective but in the context of a nation this isn't the situation I speak of the larger collective.
183 2018-10-20 03:45:20 I am a steel trader. The suprising thing is that steel prices are still firm because demand in  China is still very firm. On top of that Chinese Government are controlling supply of steel. I would think the same goes for all commodities except for oil.

› Be quality conscious, not brand conscious

186 2018-10-20 03:10:52 FWIW I have bid up commodities in the past just to make sure the puts I sold did not get exercised.  I also sold to keep a short call position from going ITM.  Maybe someone was short the 10/19 260 puts but long the 10/26 255 puts. So many possible combos.
187 2018-10-20 03:00:42 Lets see...
No repatriated funds, no one convictef of corruption.
Plenty fuel queues, ridiculous prices for basic commodities, shortages on cooking oil and the like,bond getting to 1:1 to rand. Score of minus 3 is fair

190 2018-10-20 02:43:07 Você esqueceu que ao longo desses 14 anos (arredondando, já que foram 13,3 anos), a quadrilha estava solta roubando um país de 'democracia emergente' e próspero em commodities. Só que agora o cenário é outro: a casa caiu e o líder do bando também foi preso. É agora ou nunca.
191 2018-10-20 02:42:46 Still some in wonderland thinking that this govt is good, truth is, skyrocketing fuel and gas prices, rising commodities prices, neglected south India that too Tamil Nadu in particular. This government have deserted people when needed the most.

193 2018-10-20 02:21:53 Placing themselves above creation, they take our rights, our dignity and thwart our resistance, making us prisoners in our own land. 
They view human beings and the natural world as mere commodities to exploit until exhaustion or collapse.
194 2018-10-20 02:10:44 Players are not commodities they are people. Look at Daley Blind a versitile talented player. Mourinho doesn’t like him so he had to leave.

201 2018-10-20 00:54:47 Welcome mate! Agree with you 100%. Insane from a national security perspective to have key commodities and manufacturing hubs outside your alliance network, let alone your home country.
202 2018-10-21 23:51:47 The ASEAN countries are sellers of commodities to China. US economy doesn't depend on selling to to China. Some farmers get hurt, but they're not the economy. Spare parts for jet engines, CN must buy from US or they'd be making them already.

238 2018-10-21 20:44:51 Eu to vendo a lapada internacional que vamos tomar, vai começar nos commodities.
239 2018-10-21 20:41:58 Gambling is OK if you have discretionary income,
about 5% of liquid assets could be used for gambling
examples, any game with a 50/50 outcome
that includes stocks, $DAX index, Commodities, Options, etc.

Most traders GAMBLE 100% of liquid assets
Ruin Probability is very high

240 2018-10-21 20:35:33 #Cryptocurrencies Currently, there are five major asset classes. The list includes stocks, bonds, commodities, alternatives and cash. Eventually, cryptocurrencies will be added as a sixth asset class. #BTC
241 2018-10-21 20:32:52 So a country that has plenty of dollars but doesn't produce basic commodities such a country offers cheap dollars. So what to they do? They supply you with all sorts of things and leave once they've milked us dry.
242 2018-10-21 20:19:59 Completely agree the dollar is an extreme low all Commodities are going to be monkey hammered
243 2018-10-21 20:18:45 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.
244 2018-10-21 20:14:08 [She scowls.]

Whatever gets me most money, man. I paid a lot for this android, then The Man decided they were living beings and treating them like what they are -commodities - is illegal, which means my money down the drain.

I want my money's worth, and a better android.
245 2018-10-21 20:12:40 This government is nonsense cant you see people are suffering no enough petrol or diesel basic commodities are very expensive are we living in a same life no we are not us majority we are suffering yet u you enjoy your luxuries life you dont even care about us
246 2018-10-21 20:03:52 I have avoided the fruitless commodities that Amazon has to offer for many years until recently. I’m afraid I have climbed into a very dark hole in which I will never know the likes of an Amazon free world again.
247 2018-10-21 20:03:40 If ECB stops their QE that will be bearish for the dollar &good for gold. Plus if inflation increases then stocks and bonds lose their appeal and commodities will rise.  Also rising rates may tank stocks but easing them would also unnerve the market so both being good for gold
248 2018-10-21 20:00:09 Our problem isn't money. We've tried using the US dollar but look at us today, we have shortages of commodities as well as the US dollar. We need as a people to discourage government from borrowing because that money is never put to good and productive use.
249 2018-10-21 19:52:16 We did that because you put your own ambitions above our aspirations. Because you wanted Kashmiris to be puppets obeying your orders. Our freedom will and should come at our conditions. We are not commodities to be thrown around your round tables.
250 2018-10-21 19:39:38 Where do the commodities come from? After several assurances by companies themselves, people still want to believe in crisis. What does government have to do?
251 2018-10-21 19:38:28 TV anchors /#NEWS program hosts are not able to see extreme high prices of #Commodities in the #markets,  although they all have families & have to manage expenses in their homes. 

#inflation
Either they are corrupt or don't have a calibre to speak truth Infront of #Government
252 2018-10-21 19:33:36 It’s the start of a new era I believe everything will be tokenised stocks housing commodities and I hope that one day xrp will be the bridge for at least half of all of that
253 2018-10-21 19:28:41 Looking forward towards this beautiful couple impact on humanity as they scholarly influence industrial balance of romance, family values, corporate maximization of profits and tradeable commodities
254 2018-10-21 19:19:11 A turma do Bolsonaro tem o que comemorar. Mas a guerra só estará ganha quando o governo do capitão tiver resultados na economia iguais ou melhores que os do governo Lula, sem a ajuda internacional das commodities. Não pensem que será um passeio.
255 2018-10-21 19:12:50 For the past two weeks, the sunday mail has joined the basic commodities. It has been in short supply.  Zimpapers is printing less than a quater of what it used to print. Unless you post the article here, we will not be able to read it....
256 2018-10-21 19:00:39 In that case you clearly do not derive any extra utility from the price reduction. I guess that would be unlikely for grocery commodities anyway.
257 2018-10-21 18:53:12 When u get in power
Bread now $1.10.Fuel ques everywhere.Basic commodities now scarce and very expensive.Introduction of taxis 2 every1.Fuel qs everywhere.We are still waiting to witness and enjoy those mega deals you signed.Shops now asking for US$
258 2018-10-21 18:45:07 Pti defeat in bye election in its stronghold at Peshawar and swat is an eye openor. People's voted against pricehike, inflation and heiraditary politics. It's time for Pti to revisit policies and control price hike. People's wants jobs and daily commodities at affordable rates.
259 2018-10-21 18:42:13 Oil is also traded in futures market. Yet its up at $80 a barrel. Commodities in short supply don't ignore fundamentals.
260 2018-10-21 18:39:37 Alcohol kills - 90,000 yr

Cigarettes kill - 450,000 yr

Food kills - 120,000 yr

Alcohol Cigarettes and Food are the highest taxed commodities in America!

But Meds are tax free
Is that why their anti pain meds?
261 2018-10-21 18:37:50 Humans have become commodities hence we have based our perceptions of one's value on "Net"  over  "Real" ( principles & Morals )
262 2018-10-21 18:23:25 Scotland doesn't have to be in a union with EU countries to trade with them, just as it doesn't need to be in a union with the rest of the world's countries to trade with them. I don't regard democracy and sovereignty as tradable commodities, I regard them as precious.
263 2018-10-21 18:17:49 Never stop being amazed at how well UC networks of privilege work. Caste has become invisible, credentials & commodities have taken their place. Those who deal in this currency are "humans" who reject caste. Crass casteism was easier to pin point & fight, as it was visible.
264 2018-10-21 18:11:56 Workers are disposable commodities for the politcians.
265 2018-10-21 18:07:53 It’s additive no? All of it should names and shamed. Oil barrels are of less importance - commodities don’t have flags as you know Brett
266 2018-10-21 18:02:17 Th weightings are put to acknowledge that people do not spend equally on all the commodities they consume as households. All this i assume any Economist wld know.
267 2018-10-21 17:49:41 Thank you for Speaking out  about this.
It's truly sad that these managements treat their trainees as commodities rather than human beings with physical and emotional needs.
It's high time that we speak up against such inhumane treatment 
#EastLightJustice
268 2018-10-21 17:48:32 Next stage; Basic Commodities Supply Side Intervention (Bacossi).
269 2018-10-21 17:46:19 Immigration isn’t that easy. People aren’t queuing up to come to a place that makes them unwelcome, treats them like commodities and worse. That’s already happening. ‘Managed migration’ can only set upper limits. It’s a recipe for disaster.
270 2018-10-21 17:41:21 did u even went to  attend school ..kunechinonzi inflation go bck to school economy cnt b controlled by use of power mugabe aka cuter ma price ema commodities by half in 2007 zvinhu zvika disapear from shops be factual not political ..
271 2018-10-21 17:35:44 1st spots are most important & making sure to get a good number on stone & to take advantage of shortages on commodities. (Ex. Bad numbers on brick except 1 number) Knowing what people need during trades is important as well, like if they aren’t on a certain commodity always 2-1
272 2018-10-21 17:29:37 Geoffrey I really appreciate your point made on perspective ... parents seeing players as assets and coaches as commodities. Also see your point on kids not being ‘allowed’ to fail. That’s a culture shift that has to be reset and driven by both parents and coaches.
273 2018-10-21 17:18:53 “We are in this together” they say... people are queuing for basic commodities, paying more taxes, lack of medication due to currency problems but the party has money to purchase new vehicles?! How are we in this together? Completely detached bourgeoisie leadership this is 
274 2018-10-21 17:13:25 @ProfOsinbajo Does the political Klass know Nigerians can no longer afford items/commodities produced in Nigeria?
1. Light 
2. Petrol, Diesel,  Kerosene (kerosene re only found in black mkt)
3.portable water
4. Bag of Rice
5. Even housing

276 2018-10-21 16:40:52 Yay, everyone can be treated as low cost commodities and the whole World can be dragged down to the lowest possible level.

In the name of equality and diversity.
277 2018-10-21 16:40:04 Hahaha sthandwa. Im so horrible. Still haven’t apped you

Anyway the caption is inspired by the shortage of some commodities here in Zim. So cooking oil is almost equivalent to a diamond ring right now #ZimHumour
278 2018-10-21 16:39:20 The rural voter got screwed, farmers will go bankrupt starting next year. China has cancelled most Commodities orders for next year. Farmers will either vote out the GOP or lose their farms next year to own the Libs 
279 2018-10-21 16:37:10 This is a reflection on parents thinking their kids are assets and coaches thinking their players are commodities. Yes kids need to be allowed to fail and face adversity, but the sport system is set up now to push away those who fail, not help them get back up.
280 2018-10-21 16:30:56 I’ve enjoyed our discussion. Thank you. I’d love to see those who you say pay more than Fairtrade prices for their coffee or other commodities publicly say so and how much. That must surely be a win win for them, consumers and most importantly farmers in the developing world.
281 2018-10-21 16:30:33 Any more complex than paying for an over production of ag commodities?
282 2018-10-21 16:28:46 Heartening Zimbabwean national team rewarded with cooking oil for winning. Cooking oil among the most scarce commodities in Zim. US dollars to scarce. money spent on election financing talk about bad governance. We are cursed
283 2018-10-21 16:21:00 These are the very people who are hoarding these scarce commodities. vamawanepi mafuta ese aya
284 2018-10-21 16:12:02 two part tweet here - 1) this is the issue for me. my gut says IRL scenes matter, but i'm not certain that music can serve as the nexus of culture/aesthetics/politics when it's become a medium-sans-commodity form. it increasingly only has value when affixed to other commodities.
285 2018-10-21 16:06:26 “The issue for oil is if the Saudi explanation satisfies the U.S. president and Congress which it evidently doesn’t do Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Emirates NBD said Sunday. The integrity of the U.S.-Saudi relationship has a ?  up move in oil could come about. #ukog
286 2018-10-21 15:50:04 We are tired of tribal politics can you raise important issues like how to reduce kerosene and other basic commodities,plz
287 2018-10-21 15:46:49 Players are commodities and worth millions to their clubs. As a result, they need to be protected from injuries that could ruin careers...
288 2018-10-21 15:43:49 Agree.  IMO they realized this a long ago; at least '09 (but likely way earlier.  Everything China has been doing (swapping USDs for finite hard assets/commodities globally) points to that.  Once both sides agree on terms of RBGO ending, USD gets repriced lower, & its win/win.
289 2018-10-21 15:35:37 Accident I think. Involving a shop owener or those crooks who go around looking for scarce commodities for resell makinig 1000% profit
290 2018-10-21 15:20:38 No, cuz commodities aren't rights.
291 2018-10-21 15:20:09 Given the past decade of income uncertainty and ever higher tax bills on commodities its no surprise.
292 2018-10-21 15:18:57 Do you support eliminating the socialist programs Medicare and Social Security as well? What about the government manipulation of commodities?  What is more socialist than that?
293 2018-10-21 15:14:19 Once again Republicans like KatonDawson ignore rural communitiesHas he forgotten that theGOP single handedly cut off their export markets w/zero new markets ready to go? TheGOP has forcedfarmers to sell the Govt their commodities at a loss. TheGOP does NOT have their #AMJoy
294 2018-10-21 15:06:26 Considering its been around since 1974, it's almost impossible to pinpoint "intestinal issues" to any 1 specific cause over the past 40+ years. Especially if it's one that consumers are only exposed to at the ppm, if not ppb range from raw agricultural commodities.
295 2018-10-21 15:03:04 Everyday FAKE news reminds us that LYING DEMOCRATIC adversaries are still working hard to sow division in our country by seizing on the controversies du jour!
It’s more important than ever that our COUNTRY IGNORE LIES and instead rise above to unify and focus on our commodities.
296 2018-10-21 15:02:41 Another curious thing:  The Chinese trade war is going to hit Walmart very hard, across an amazingly large swath of commodities (not exempted easily). Trump's base will suffer price increases, and HOLIDAY price increases. Will Trump be held responsible? (Probably not)
297 2018-10-21 14:58:20 Na the same matter most of us dey wonder about: how things will be so tough for the poor with about more than 100% increase for price of essential commodities and very few no even care but support it. After ya paddyman avoided you on Facebook, him no fit dodge you for Twitter.
298 2018-10-21 14:56:22 Get ready for outrageous inflation and worthless commodities.  Throw you pennies at the farmers and publicly pat yourselves on the back about it.  Meanwhile, pork farmers go bankrupt.  Congratulations kickback Graham
299 2018-10-21 14:36:13 Got asked to do some part-time consultancy by an ex-colleague. Was actually really missing working in commodities analysis should be good.
300 2018-10-21 14:33:38 @bamandie your hatred of Chamisa....hopefully u r not blaming him for the shortages in basic commodities like cooking oil,Mazoe etc
301 2018-10-21 14:31:51 How's the situation with basic commodities there?
302 2018-10-21 14:02:57 Sim! Precisamos deixar de ser o país das commodities e passar a exportar valor agregado... tecnologia de ponta... Lançar nossos próprios foguetes!
303 2018-10-21 14:00:48 From other newsletter commentaries, I believe that @robmay subscribes to the idea that automation will drive the price of physical commodities toward zero. However, per his Labor Day newsletter, he isn’t worried about the nature of emerging synthetic markets. 20/47
304 2018-10-21 14:00:10 What @robmay has identified here is, in fact, a solution to the death of Capitalism. Once you can create synthetic consumers to sell synthetic commodities to in order to collect synthetic capital, as long as no one questions the basic story (Capitalism) you’re set for life! 22/47
305 2018-10-21 13:59:37 Reading #POSTCAPITALISM by @paulmasonnews, I’m increasingly convinced that Capitalism WILL find a way to adapt and create new markets—whether that means monetizing social interactions or selling digital commodities to AIs. 24/47
306 2018-10-21 13:48:59 Profit driven  private care agencies and care managers that work on commission  - what a recipe for disaster.
Clients are people, not commodities.
307 2018-10-21 13:36:38 seeeeee....como grandes importadores de cobre, acero, soja, trigo...o sea commodities, que llenando 1000 panamax enteros compensas con la exportación de un solo satélite... jeje
308 2018-10-21 13:34:34 2/3 Curious that for some asset classes—different types of bond funds, precious metals, commodities—somewhat shorter look-backs seem better than 12.  (But I say that based on very little data: just playing with PortVis and observing some Seeking Alpha posts etc.).
309 2018-10-21 13:31:27 1. Commodities & FX wld be discussed afta we hve covered stocks & others.

2. Political Tension is creating uncertainties in mkt, this had really impacted mkt sentiments significantly.

Factors dt influence stock price wld be discussed in our future classes. Thanks.
310 2018-10-21 13:28:47 No veo caída generalizada en los precios de los commodities
311 2018-10-21 13:26:44 What's the cost of a newspaper that is always highlighting price increases of commodities? Have these papers maintained their prices  so far?
312 2018-10-21 13:16:44 Only a handful of matches. Nasim made his debut only this month, the other 2 are unknown commodities as well. 

Pak A is not Pak rising stars team. Its just 1 stage below the national team and so the selection criteria should reflect that too

314 2018-10-21 13:03:44 They don't not understand that 'time' and 'space' are the most delightful commodities for 'SOME' people.  This is not for everyone of course!
315 2018-10-21 12:59:56 I hope you will talk about commodities and how we trade them in the sessions to come? I am really curious about how it works too. 

I also want to ask about how much sentiments in the market will affect the stock price on NSE. The general election issue too.
316 2018-10-21 12:56:27 The benefits of reform is always harmful for political parties n sellers of religion commodities
317 2018-10-21 12:54:25 #SinCorbataTVN todos los países que se han reinventado tecnológicamente necesariamente arriesgaron la comodidad macroeconómica de los commodities, con mucha inversión, tiempo y espacio, para eso se requiere decisión, visión y desprendimiento político y empresarial que acá no hay.
318 2018-10-21 12:47:26 Diesel price Rs 80.87 whereas Petrol price Rs 80.69 per litre at Bhubaneswar Odisha it happens first time in history  when crude price falling how Diesel price gone up what farmers Transporters can do now price of essential commodities went up.What Modi Govt tell the Nation?
319 2018-10-21 12:32:50 Mr President, that do we n need for a peace of legislation to twart  the black market for currencies and commodities?Copy in GNU .
320 2018-10-21 12:31:36 Prof I propose that the Government open borders and remove duty on all basic commodities, trucks, buses and equipment while putting its house inorder.The revenue loss to government can be easily compensated by the unpopular 2% on transactions.
321 2018-10-21 12:31:18 Companies that have no regard for the same commodities that they serve. You should shun them or just burn those buses that are causing an obstruction on you right to an organized life.
322 2018-10-21 12:30:09 The start of a very long bear market. The bear is here . Time to long commodities
323 2018-10-21 12:28:28 @Asad_Umar introduce 2 or 3 tier pricing for basic commodities like aata daal etc for poor, middle n rich class. Issue cards to poor n cap their spending. No cash only discount on buying. Offer peacekeeping force to Saudi Yemen crisis. #welfare #dollar crisis
324 2018-10-21 12:28:05 @ImranKhanPTI introduce 2 or 3 tier pricing for basic commodities like aata daal etc for poor, middle n rich class. Issue cards to poor n cap their spending. No cash only discount on buying. Offer peacekeeping force to Saudi Yemen crisis. #welfare #dollar crisis
325 2018-10-21 12:12:52 Naaaa,but u shud undastand,som women can't afford som things.govt shud takia of som essential commodities.
326 2018-10-21 12:11:25 Also confirms the concept of being long commodities over the long run is shorting human ingenuity.
327 2018-10-21 12:08:03 They just redenominated their currency 4 yrs ago by removing three zeroes! Zambia prblm is nt chinese alone..They import all basic commodities frm SA except T-bone.
328 2018-10-21 12:07:54 With due apology I request PTI LEADERSHIP to intimate Nation about a Single Change/Tabdeeli happened in Pakistan and felt by the Common Men. Yes Only Price Hike of all essential commodities. I prefer to live in old Pakistan rather than in this new Pakistan. @PTIofficial @BBCWorld
329 2018-10-21 12:04:45 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
330 2018-10-21 12:03:25 Knowledge about Zim is no preserve of the few my dear comrade. I have interests in Zim, plenty of them. Each time i come there with my hard earned money i see con business people trying to impoverish me by manipulating currency and cheating on prices of commodities and that hurts
331 2018-10-21 11:50:42 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
332 2018-10-21 11:32:12 yes always balance the risk, quite important to have a good balanced pf with several metals/commodities and exposure to a uranium one is a must have within next few months. Not in 1 just yet but looking...
333 2018-10-21 11:26:37 Excuse me sir? Isn't declaring the bond and RTGS equal to the USD a form of price control? 
Like price controls of commodities this position has caused a black market exchange rate.
334 2018-10-21 11:14:14 Simple, Importers & Dealers in Iran rushed to  import stuffs from US in wake of coming sanctions and above that dedication of subsidised rate 42,000 Rial/$ during May. 
Unprecedented  in almost all commodities and triggered by speculation for big surge in price of imported goods.
335 2018-10-21 11:05:03 4464: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
336 2018-10-21 11:04:16 I generally expect that the winter is going to be bad on the stockmarkets with the midterms, earnings season, 25% tariffs, Italy, Brexit and so on. 

This will suit commodities to move up & generally FA based crypto as well (not an insane bull run, just normal steady growth).
337 2018-10-21 11:02:01 This is worse off than Stone age because there were no long & winding queues for basic commodities like ED's new dispensation.
338 2018-10-21 10:47:41 I realise, but I am tired of hearing people defend businesses as 'neutral', as 'just' actors responding in a changing market, this is how banks & traders defend their actions in inflating prices of 'commodities' of which everything has become & why the world is buggered.
339 2018-10-21 10:34:32 All this stuff about people being slaves, alienation, fetishism of commodities etc is all just made up. These things are just reality, and in the end people's choices in a harsh world. His alternative is an impossible utopia. Also, the labour theory of value was a massive error
340 2018-10-21 10:32:21 I think we are entering a bull market for all commodities, wouldn’t be surprised that the tops for vanadium and uranium will be in the same period :)

342 2018-10-21 10:22:39 Leave the present govt's incompetence aside, any hike in gas prices + other commodities is due to an earnest contributions of previous govt(s). No matter who, all U guys do is dirty politics, do a little for poor Awaam. If AZ and NS were so competent, IK would stand no chance
343 2018-10-21 10:19:34 This is not a stock. Commodities and socks behave little different.
344 2018-10-21 10:10:21 I am a bit confused by the latest bit of LNP spin. What does "retail politician" mean? Are you saying you are commodities and you have been well and truly bought? #corrupt
345 2018-10-21 10:06:29 You are the unfortunate one here boy! What style are we talking about? Obj/Atiku (PDP) took over in 1999. How much were the prices of those commodities u mentioned? And how much were they in 2015? I hope someday, u go back home and learn how argue without insult.
346 2018-10-21 10:05:03 3193: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
347 2018-10-21 09:58:30 Importing a car is a luxury Amark. Vehicles importers are depleting our forex reserves so let them pay Gvt services in forex. There is nothing amiss there. As long as basic commodities are charged in bond notes or RTGS teachers & the rest of workers shld not demand US salaries
348 2018-10-21 09:45:37 State #subsidy on basic food stuff & key commodities like fuel, energy... is the core duty for any caring Govt.
If Egypt (with 80ml+ population) can maintain the price of its basic meal (bread) at 5cents - for decades, why can't the highly job starved #SA?
349 2018-10-21 09:35:32 Hmmmmmmmmmm, now that Buhari has equated our economy with Sim Card. Let him activate Boko Haram, Fulani Herdsmen, Hunger, Poverty, High in Prices of Food Stuff and Other Essential Commodities. Oni Iranu
350 2018-10-21 09:32:50 Duduk as PM @chedetofficial pun susah,  teruk. Major commodities rolling downhills tapi parti2 politik pun dah tak stabil.  So stay la sampai abis hayat
351 2018-10-21 09:28:53 Proper farming .
Here’s hoping such a balanced system can profitable survive in a world of cheap *who knows what standard* globally sourced commodities feeding *cheapest is best* consumers and undermining our businesses.

355 2018-10-21 09:20:07 Republicans are the party of racism because their policies only benefit rich people who are disproportionately white.If you support a party whose policies worsen racial inequality  ,then you are a racist.
356 2018-10-21 09:17:41 Guy, u are arguing off point... If you are serious about "How much" can you apply d same logic as to how much was the prices of those commodities in 1999 before the advent of your beloved PDP.
357 2018-10-21 09:10:21 thank you for effort, but how come Mr President, that during the GNU there was no need for any legislation to outlaw the black market for currencies and commodities?
358 2018-10-21 09:02:15 Pano hndi endless? Musta naman ang rice crisis, peso & shares sharp fall, hi infllation, ballooning foreign debt, widening trade deficit, hi prices of transpo, basic commodities, billions of drug smugglng, unresolvd killings of smalltime drugdealers as bigtime druglords run free?
359 2018-10-21 09:01:10 What about $DIG and @cryptobontix? Crypto backed by real commodities, gonna be huge.

361 2018-10-21 08:55:54 Businesses that will rather run at loss just so that customers will not complain are the reason why we have people thinking a company will sell high cost commodities for cheap. Wake up! Some companies sell x2 of their people cost on Fuel.

363 2018-10-21 08:54:02 Its so difficult to argue with a man in love and anyone supporting Buhari.... Buhari has failed in every sector, economy(our every day commodities has tripled in price), rule of law(el zaczaky and Sambo Dasuki etc), anti corruption(babachir lawal, wale oke, abba kyari etc),
364 2018-10-21 08:37:05 you’re a piece of shit if you support/attend the zoo, the circus, sea world and any other privatized institution where animals are exploited, abused, punished and are kept as mere commodities
365 2018-10-21 08:29:04 What if the government subsidizes basic commodities and let private organizations charge whatever currency they deem fit on the condition that they pay salaries in that that same currency... While @MthuliNcube and co. make efforts to join the rand union
366 2018-10-21 08:07:21 The people recognize themselves in their commodities; they find their soul in their automobile, hi-fi set, split-level home, kitchen equipment. - Herbert Marcuse
367 2018-10-21 08:05:55 Just follow the orders as we are obeying all other orders. Like Taxes on Electricity, Gas, Patrol and other commodities. So why you only protest for such a nice rule which increases the respect of our Ladies.
368 2018-10-21 08:03:42 Bottom in and accumulation almost finished. Big boys will fomo to diversify their porfolio with crypto, commodities and tokenized assets when global markets crash and the next recession cycle kicks in. Change my mind.
369 2018-10-21 07:44:16 How they will he be accepted is easy enough to calculate.

Data:
Hierarchy of Needs
Cost of Commodities
Land Area
Population

Procedure:
1. Chop up population based on Basic Units,  Per City?
2. Marinade it with hierarchy of needs and see what sticks to what
3. Mix in the rest.
370 2018-10-21 07:43:57 Except middle classes are beginning to feel the effects of toxic Tory policies too. Paying for private health care, no recourse to legal aid, rising crime, house prices, all commodities, petrol, energy, Council tax, food all Whilst infrastructure crumbles. Pot holes, rail fares
371 2018-10-21 07:40:35 That is the best way to contain the hoarding cartel. Adding goods other than the scarce commodities makes speculative buying very expensive hence unattractive and unviable. Making these products accessible to the working class who can't spend all day queuing for such items.
372 2018-10-21 07:31:59 Its not hoarding but merely HEDGING i think. people want to save their money. USD is scarce the only thing available are commodities.
373 2018-10-21 07:31:40 I am sorry, but you can't prove this by posting links from another country. Do you have list of commodities that are being taxed /not taxed by FIRS.  Get that, then we can talk
374 2018-10-21 07:15:12 @narendramodi  first time chief of all 3 services  will report to NSA . Defense budget being cut short .

375 2018-10-21 07:06:47 Reverse to 2013 to April 2016 we had Chinamasa as finance minister,USD was still available on demand with no basic commodities shortages,problem emanated the day someone decided to bring bond note against warnings of such moves,with deficit of trust USD took a flight overnight.
376 2018-10-21 07:03:11 But on one side are white people who have been oppressing black people since ages and still do, Not long ago they were buying and selling black people as if they were commodities and they started calling them Negros during this time. Still think nothing wrong with the term?
377 2018-10-21 07:01:18 Total disagreement here. Its time for commodities to shine. Larger cycles are against equity.
378 2018-10-21 06:46:17 1929, 1987,2008 all the same animal difference jungles
In 2008/11 AU had record tax take, bank profits, mining construction, commodities prices, low inflation ,low interest rates, low unemployment, good growth
No need to stimulate till 2011 when they should have
379 2018-10-21 06:37:41 This is the issue we should be dealing with. @Zimra_11 should find an effective way to deal with the delays at the boarder, on other end people should process their papers in advance for some of their commodities.
380 2018-10-21 06:32:30 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
381 2018-10-21 06:20:43 lets say gvt suspends SI64 tomorrow, will it bring price stability and commodities availability. and will our local products be able to compete.

382 2018-10-21 06:14:39 The poor (majority) in the country need us. They cannot afford to hoard commodities or buy them on the black market. They cannot afford to be sick because pharmacies require USD$10 or alternative $50 bondnote for medicines  Lets pray for them.
383 2018-10-21 06:09:54 Buhari is just waking up
During the reign of Olugbon things were getting better
During the reign of Aaresatere was prosperity
During the reign of APC Buhari no job, no security and the prices of commodities went up.
384 2018-10-21 06:07:38 Sky-rocketing of essential commodities, rising price of petrol and diesel, Rafael deal issue--have all taken a back seat following Me Too trending which has now turned a hot subject. Seems like diversionary tactics by politicos.
385 2018-10-21 05:46:52 It would have been popcorn all year if commodities didn't take such a hit.

386 2018-10-21 05:38:33 It's like someone else pointed out ... CPPs are the 2nd run of a Tuskegee experiment! Politicians don't see us as human beings but rather as commodities they can no longer reap labor from.

388 2018-10-21 05:17:48 You are 100% correct the problem is planning, organising and coordination. Zim is a net importer of almost all agro Commodities besides tobacco. The irony is that we have almost all other resources required for production. Our planning and organizing need to be spruced up
389 2018-10-21 05:16:57 Materialist concept of history starts with proposition that production & exchange of commodities is the basis of all social structure.
Every historical society, the manner in which wealth is distributed & the society divided into, is based on production-relation in the society.
390 2018-10-21 04:44:07 There were no shortages of basic commodities,the USD was readily available on demand,there was renewed hope for the country's development trajectory,the economy couldn't operate at full throttle because of some systemic structural incongruence which impeded the flow of FDI.
391 2018-10-21 04:39:27 Malacanang: The findings tell us that our people, indeed, recognize and appreciate the efforts of the administration in stabilizing the prices of basic commodities and bringing a comfortable and dignified life for all. @Team_Inquirer

397 2018-10-21 03:58:18 You are right Matt, however take joe Gomez say, with his injury record many fans would have binned him off but clubs dont work that way, JK is such a warm human being he treats them as people not commodities.
398 2018-10-21 03:52:10 Moreover, what he did at Kotak Commodities was obnoxious!! No one is a saint in our country!!
399 2018-10-21 03:15:41 Communism isn't feasible without an over abundant surplus of public goods and commodities as well as large power supplies in order to maintain public services indefinitely. Socialism can only be achieved in late stages of human and economic development, we simply aren't there yet

402 2018-10-21 02:22:57 Treating women like commodities. WTF.
403 2018-10-21 02:10:48 Agora temos 14 milhões de desempregados, estamos na maior crise que o Brasil já viu, a Petrobras foi alvo do maior esquema de corrupção já visto.

406 2018-10-21 01:25:04 Rec room, huh? *She steps into the area proper, taking a few more peeks around to spot all the various amenities and commodities within*

412 2018-10-19 23:42:52 Most common complaint I’m hearing from so many doctors out there, in many different specialties: our overlords view clinicians as commodities, care only about cost not quality, and want the lowest cost providers they can employ.
413 2018-10-19 23:27:52 If the Department of Agriculture and the National Food Authority would insist in controlling rice importation, sorry to say this but it would worsen the high inflation in basic commodities which was reported as of yesterday to be at 6.2%. And it might worsen the already sorry
414 2018-10-19 23:25:50 You do realize that companies do this on durable goods to offset future purchases of commodities right? Cashflow isn't guaranteed to meet the expected margins at all times. 

Pick up an economics book and read about elasticity.

486 2018-10-19 17:58:31 I will also prefer to be paid in forex but I'm a realist. I know there is no forex in the country. The little that gvt has is being used to procure essential commodities like drugs & fuel. So why would I want to crowd the forex supply line?

488 2018-10-19 17:57:27 Theirs is such a trash way of thinking! People are more than just commodities or stepping stones on your way to success, for goodness' sake. 

So sorry. You deserve better.
489 2018-10-19 17:51:11 Welcome to the commodification of welfare (in real life). People as  objects and commodities, the needs of the market paramount: austerity  and cost cutting where it's at. This costs too much? Then cut  it. Losing sight of people+humanity (or humane actions) the logical  outcome!

514 2018-10-19 16:25:36 "Squaw" is a pejorative term given Native American women by colonialists. It translates to "cunt". It was part of the effort to dehumanize indigenous women and cast them as sexual commodities in order to rationalize raping and murdering them.

540 2018-10-19 14:44:30 We’re not against the texture or taste of meat. We’re against the killing of animals and using them as commodities. That’s the ethical standpoint of veganism. It isn’t to do with the texture of meat
541 2018-10-19 14:44:00 The accuracy of this statement. With proven commodities, it’s totally inexplicable but happens far less often. Players with real potential is what really gets me.

570 2018-10-19 12:28:18 What is the point of this "landmark" trade if it is neo colonial trade (with India exporting commodities, raw materials to China & importing finished products from china). Dont believe what the pink papers are saying. Think yourself.

5-geopolitics.
Once you get the larger pic u get to know which commodity will see a hike for future contracts vs spot trading.
At least that's how i look@ it

577 2018-10-19 12:00:57 It's not about Forex, but the prices of every other commodities has gone up, so if the snooker guy keeps selling tokens at 25c he won't be able to purchase the commodities he wants. This is inflation in general.
578 2018-10-19 11:32:35 I waited 2 hours for fuel with a 1/4 tank, because I didn't have faith that if it were to run dry, I would get it when I need it. The same will apply to cooking oil, and all the other basic commodities.

591 2018-10-19 10:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
592 2018-10-19 10:13:44 It’s front loading all thoses costs. Based on current electricity and fuel prices, 6.8 years is my payback time.  That will get shorter as prices for those commodities rise.
593 2018-10-19 10:03:27 So you think that no deal means the EU stop all transport of goods, people and commodities without a workaround? 

Literally would never happen. Ever. Ever.
594 2018-10-19 10:00:41 MOI led the country for 24 years without the Chinese & we never paid tax as we pay today. Basic commodities were still affordable to a common man
595 2018-10-19 10:00:31 #HealthSummit Mabuza: poor procurement makes it impossible to have adequate health commodities.
596 2018-10-19 09:58:37 The Chinese also invested in hi-tech education,they believed that there is no need to reinvent the wheel and so they took the very western technology and perfected it.
And from cheap labour comes cheap commodities,then the west became comsumers of Chinese products.

600 2018-10-19 09:44:03 It’s interesting how ‘conservative’ the estimates were last year and how ‘optimistic’ this year. Forecasting is quite hard but to try to guess EUA prices with the backdrop of world economics, politics, weather, other energy/commodities prices...might as well ask my astrologer
601 2018-10-19 09:36:05 Anyone with more market experience than me got any idea of how the stock market will get tokenised and run on ledger rather than through brokers? Will there be a 1:1 asset swap? will it be a fast switch or a slower bleed and evolution? Same for other markets liek commodities

I am running short of words!
That's just disgusting!!

I think, K-pop Industry is missing out a very important fact!
And that is IDOLS ARE LIVING BEINGS!!

They ought to stop treating 'idols'( who are actually 'humans') as commodities!
We need #JusticeForTheEastLight !!!!
603 2018-10-19 09:19:46 Our exports to US are limited from a Seafreight perspective.  A mature market with limited commodities.
That won't change much in the short to medium.  Its remained static for years.

615 2018-10-19 08:03:46 It is good to contextualize your argument. Its best to stick to factual truths about commodities & shortages thereof. In Zim our dis-functionality cuts through infrastructure and lately commodities (or production). Why pple weren't hoarding during GNU era? Bad economic policies.

617 2018-10-19 07:57:08 Because we destabilize those countries? And blockade th and sanction them disavowing basic commodities?
618 2018-10-19 07:49:12 People are simply offloading the officially devalued RTGS balances for any useful and valuable commodity. It's called migration from RTGS balances (virtual money) to Commodities. There is nothing wrong with that. It is an unintended consequence of the bad economic policies.
619 2018-10-19 07:44:54 Maybe you can highlight the dis-functionality of say SA & US in as far as cooking oil and shortages of other commodities are concerned?
620 2018-10-19 07:43:14 $gvt undoubtedly. Only 4.5 million supply! Current market cap is only 54 million. Huge potential for growth. They have the beta platform coming up at the end of this month. Average Joe will be able to invest into crypto, commodities, through skilled manager.
621 2018-10-19 07:37:48 Around September a neighborhood acquaintance - unrelated to market - asked about trading in commodities. He said he knew someone making10K per day and he was going to start doing it himself. 

Sometimes these things can be early indicators of froth in the market.
622 2018-10-19 07:36:00 By the way, customs have increased Import Duty again. So except an increase in price of commodities. 

Sai Buhari.
623 2018-10-19 07:32:33 ? And how were those before Buhari doing it, that the economy was fairly stable and prices of commodities were affordable compare to now that leakages have been blocked. During the era of PDP (Obasanjo) our foreign debts were cleared, and our foreign reserve  boosted...?

632 2018-10-19 06:55:06 I don’t disagree with what you’re saying and it’s well taken. But that does not stop the Suns energy from being free. For example, fossil fuels are commodities which must be purchased and converted to energy. The Suns energy is not purchasable and thus free.

659 2018-10-19 04:56:45 And I almost think at least one of the two big commodities cases are class actions but would have to check on that.
660 2018-10-19 04:47:32 You are correct. I would be a bad fit. Futures and commodities are adult swimming and learning basics about trend lines and pullbacks is a bit rudimentary at this point.
661 2018-10-19 04:43:17 Example, if federal spending is directly injected into the pockets of the poor & middle class -- individuals likely to spend it immediately on items linked fairly directly to commodities (food, fuel, electricity, clothing), then the bond market is going to penalize that spending.

667 2018-10-19 03:18:55 good thing about the fuel pricing formula (with examples) is that it has set a precedent of explaining why prices of state controlled goods are at their present value. More commodities need to be broken down this way, just so the eyewatering levels of tax are readily apparent

671 2018-10-19 02:59:27 No deberían reverse el ajuste de tarifas a distribuidoras que van por precios mayoristas? Los precios mayoristas se explican por variación dolares y commodities. En otras palabras a las distribuidoras se le ajustan sus ingresos por dólar.

676 2018-10-19 02:19:24 Exactly!  Personally I don't use any of the exchange traded cryptocurrencies because they're not cryptocurrencies at all.  Bitcoin and all altcoins utilize a commodities trading system.  None of them truly represent an electronic cash system without the need for a BANK.

693 2018-10-19 00:12:22 Just think about the commodities that gave rise to early modern capitalism, such as tea, opium, slaves, tobacco, and silver. In one way or another, they all promoted vice or were founded on exploitation.
694 2018-10-19 00:09:48 Its right in the core of M-C-M:
"The capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out of money to make more money."
