9 2018-07-17 23:22:33 Dude... half the reason big prospects are there is for chips for proven commodities. Manny's a giant fish that makes it worth it. Standing pat when you're sitting on a title is 1 thing (Eagles). Playing safe when you're 6 years irrelevant is another.
10 2018-07-17 23:15:34 In some ways, I tend to believe that China / Commodities in 2007/2008 acted in this manner. As the US market was floundering, more and more people pushed $ into commodities & China, which at that time were the "island". These were the last to drop, but they dropped big.
11 2018-07-17 23:12:35 I have my own theories about why this is.  It’s a combination of factors.  I think it’s a combination of incels — who, not coincidentally, regard women and girls as products to be sexualized by men at will, and as commodities, and who view sexual activities as transactions
12 2018-07-17 22:54:56 Si por "transables" se refiere mayormente a los commodities agrícolas entonces la recesión aflojará en los grandes números pero no en la calle.  La plata que gana el campo no derrama de igual manera que cuando lo hace la industria.

15 2018-07-17 22:37:21 I said "just" care about low costs. If your only concern is to have cheap things to buy and you have zero interest in working towards a world where those commodities are made without exploiting people, if you really don't care about that at all then yeah fuck those people.

37 2018-07-17 22:18:24 There has to be paperwork and accounts, the sisters don't come across as trusting in regard to monies and with inter congregation swapping of commodities they have a ledger. Each order must have a ledger, just ask for it. No one tripping over to the states without paperwork..ffs
38 2018-07-17 22:04:55 Prices of basic commodities are sky rocketing
39 2018-07-17 22:00:33 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.” #tpesa
40 2018-07-17 21:59:36 Dulce Technique is a hairstyling service providing commodities from hair tutorials to hair styling services.Share with friends and family and be sure to head over to our Instagram page to find out more about our competition or retweet us!
41 2018-07-17 21:56:42 Yet another example of delusion from an idiot that is being allowed to do exactly as he likes, what will it take to oust this despot. He treats people as commodities, and we are all sitting back and watching it happen. Why?
42 2018-07-17 21:48:30 It's not all bad, certain short range hops can have about 1ml profit per Type 9 load. 
Now that we have a couple of refineries back online we are actually not running a loss anymore on most commodities.
Those Damn cmm's though.
43 2018-07-17 21:41:54 Don’t try to be cool, just turn weird shit into commodities
44 2018-07-17 21:40:14 I like Putin. A lot of us arent sure about the scathing empty evidence. I followed the BRICS news from mid2000 after 9/11 the economy was a rollercoaster. Commodities are a way to track news for facts. Nuland / Greece, then Putin Russia 'of Soros Ukraine revolution. Its crazy
45 2018-07-17 21:32:41 Tell me about it. I sold some positions in a loss to extend some SL on commodities about an hour before it pumped! ... I actually think I caused this 
46 2018-07-17 21:31:42 Bueno. El FA siemore ha creido que el aumento de commodities en precio y volumen y de ganadería  y turismo era su mérito. No me extraña. Y nunca quiso entender que aumentando los impuestos se aumenta el  PBI sin hacer nada. En esas condiciones es inutil discutir. Saludos.
47 2018-07-17 21:31:14 @GovMarkDayton We support all mining, but we have some concerns about Mesabi Metallics. Tom Clarke's lack of payments to the state and Minnesota Power are worrying, Second the affiliation between Mesabi Metallics and Riverdale Commodities is also troubling, @MinnesotaMiners

Hubo un crecimiento del precio de los commodities hasta el 2010, pero eso no explica ni cerca el crecimiento del PBI.
50 2018-07-17 21:20:24 Still a difference of $2000 though! Life's too short 2 b waiting so long 4 another bull run when there are better opportunities out there. I don't even think Gold offers the best value within its own asset class of commodities to be honest. So glad I found your videos on crypto!
51 2018-07-17 21:16:42 Are you supposed to be a Stocks & bonds Trader?
Or, a Commodities Trader?
52 2018-07-17 21:07:15 YUP, de-commodify the basic necessities. UBI will likely just raise the prices of commodities.
53 2018-07-17 21:02:42 I’d be tempted to add nuance that technical progress tends to shift commodity intensity to NEW commodities in search for efficiency: eg from fossil fuel to lithium or cobalt. New tech often brings new demand and higher real prices for previously cheap commodities..for a while
54 2018-07-17 21:02:38 Tax cuts?? What tax cuts. This so-called cut was just a political hand job. These cuts didn't help anyone, except the rich. The rising price of gas, food services, and commodities washed it away... if there ever really was one... for us, that is.
55 2018-07-17 21:00:57 Awesome. Stocks, bonds, or commodities?
56 2018-07-17 21:00:13 Commodities trader? 
57 2018-07-17 20:59:51 Stocks, commodities or both? You are certainly a busy woman.
58 2018-07-17 20:58:04 Agreed. Unfortunately animals in agriculture don't know good welfare. They are seen as commodities and treated as such. Most pork comes from factory farms. This is one example of many. If you're based in the UK, @nickalder check out Land of Hope and Glory, it's all UK farms.
59 2018-07-17 20:55:56 Y’mean like commodities and currencies and stuff?
60 2018-07-17 20:43:26 I am suffering the uncertainty of commodities, labour, exchange rates, declines in disposable incomes and the lies in the headlines are not plugging the gaps. I’m not fuelling a referendum debate again but everyone became leaver and this is not how it should be led.
61 2018-07-17 20:33:50 checking account. People often buy stocks, real estate, commodities, cryptocurrencies.
No business cares what happens in 100 years, what it cares about is whether they will be able to pay salaries when they are paid by the customer, and dollar solves it very well.

63 2018-07-17 20:31:04 One thing I keep thinking about with the trade deadline getting closer...

We’ve read a lot this year about the low pay and long hours of the minor leaguers. So it’d be nice to remember they are humans being told to pack up and move to a new job and not assets or commodities

68 2018-07-17 20:12:09 Más exportación de alimentos y menos de commodities. Lo del granero de mundo no sirve. Hay que ser el supermercado del mundo.
69 2018-07-17 20:11:26 How is it a mockery? Well, not only commodities are "branded" you can make a brand out of an individual, country and communities etc
70 2018-07-17 20:01:06 It’s a day trader affair. You speculate and make money. But the fundamentals of trading can be applied to any area. I see Commodities as a good space when stocks correct. Crypto is to cash in fast
71 2018-07-17 20:00:10 #Bitcoin making a comeback amidst the commodities doldrums? $RIOT is leading the rush at +38% for the day. We're big on $HIVE and $AKE.
72 2018-07-17 19:39:39 Nasdaq still hitting new highs. Commodities (ex oil) still getting hammered. When this reverses it could be sudden. Utilities, energy, reits may be the best plays.
73 2018-07-17 19:25:31 No rallies in commodities, I’m getting killed here.
74 2018-07-17 19:23:26 Pure and edible Africa Salad (Abacha) from Amazin's Kitchen. One of our many sconbions ... Plentious 
Let's Dance4Health after we've consumed this one 

In UK, this is within the family of essential commodities.... 
If you are going to Nigeria, please buy plenty 
75 2018-07-17 19:20:57 Yes well, the President yesterday said government can not afford to invest in mines where markets determine the price of commodities. It's a high risk industry. This came as he was asked by Jane Dutton regarding the nationalisation of mines in SA.
76 2018-07-17 19:18:23 That's different though Nola and Franco are known commodities..Franco can go though tbh

90 2018-07-17 18:29:29 True. But this could be dirt cheap, especially if the sails make two way trips hauling payload both ways. And either way, with a continuous virtual conveyor belt of stuff you don’t care how fast it moves (commodities at least)
91 2018-07-17 18:23:51 Good things about modernity: painkillers, antibiotics, clean water, sanitation, electricity, central heating/air conditioning, plentiful books, relatively cheap and plentiful basic commodities like food and clothes, some bits of the Internet (not Twitter), smartphones.
92 2018-07-17 18:21:34 If by artificial, you mean real, then yes. Look at the Vix in February and tell me it's all natural, stop. How about the numerous trade desk operators at big firms booked for spoofing commodities order books? There is no "moral," just profit margins.
93 2018-07-17 18:18:44 This underscores my point about labels. According to the article, the DSA wants to take profit out of “basic necessities,” which implies they are not looking to affect (other) commodities. Moreover, they want to increase worker ownership, not necessarily impose state ownership.

105 2018-07-17 17:57:25 I was looking at the past charts, amazing dive bomb right before the 08 meltdown. I think all the fake money and ETFs have allowed the free money corruption to spread to commodities. That will need to get cleared out before we can go higher.

Furthermore, some stocks will morph into tokens to take advantage of the 24/7 functionality. Learn or be left behind.

112 2018-07-17 17:25:20 Arkratos already boasts a functional MVP providing end to end solution for the entire commodities trading ecosystem.  Digitalising the current paper-based process of trading commoditie by utilizing smart contracts is already a reality. #KRATOSICO #Arkratos
113 2018-07-17 17:21:31 Interesting. What are your thoughts around the risks of using terminology and ideology such as "natural commodities" or "natural capital"? Would you agree there is a substantive risk involved, losing all respect/relation to nature?
114 2018-07-17 17:19:05 Al agricultor siempre se le olvida que los commodities dependen de un precio internacional, no del Gobierno, ni la especulación.
Con altos costos en semillas e insumos, es imposible que pueda prosperar.
115 2018-07-17 17:13:51 Yep I'm familiar. Was a macro/commodities analyst on wall st for 10 years.
116 2018-07-17 17:09:22 Yes It may be. The economy and jobs have grown for more than 4-5 years. Stock market has yet to gain the losses since last quarter of lastcyesr. Tarrifs, food, gas, in general commodities hi in up. Healthcare going up.....where is the savings that isn't absorbed from above?

125 2018-07-17 16:25:27 Meté también  en tu análisis,  que el campo vende "commodities"  en donde el factor clave de éxito es el bajo costo que se logra con economías de escala. De no lograrlas, quebrás porque tu vosto está  arriba del precio de venta.
126 2018-07-17 16:07:03 dudes please wake up. rising rates killed commodities  look at soybeans this will drag everything down.
127 2018-07-17 16:04:41 Please stop programming the future of this nation. Can't we use same amount to subsidize commodities of daily life?

131 2018-07-17 15:51:15 Forgot to add: a third world country in life expectancy ( a 1/4 of Russian men die before reaching 55. The life expectancy for men in Russia is 64 years, ), a GDP smaller than India or Brazil ( ranked 11th) and no export economy outside of commodities. So much winning.

137 2018-07-17 15:18:51 America is controlling the price of all commodities that have a futures contract attached with High Frequency Trading. Oil is the hardest to manipulate but they suppress prices to mask how fragile the American economy is while destroying farmers, producers, miners, investors.
138 2018-07-17 15:18:26 They have a "president" for life, the economic system looks like not communism but believe everything is controlled by the state, and that's communism, obviously they gave their citizens some commodities, but it's not like we have 1 system for all things here on the west
139 2018-07-17 15:18:06 Thats how used commodities perform......
140 2018-07-17 15:17:19 "What else is down by 90 in that same period of time?"

142 2018-07-17 15:05:39 The last time I touched GC options was in December of 2017 and the results were not ideal. Maybe it's the leverage and the outsize moves, but I find that I keep my cool better with GLD options. All other commodities though, I go straight for the futures and options on those.
143 2018-07-17 15:02:47 Yeah and the US is in debt to the world economy.. have you considered this might be about more than GDP and commodities trading? Have you considered something bigger might be at play here? Like the oligarchs are maybe being ripped from power..? Would explain the media frenzy..
144 2018-07-17 14:57:54 No, it's not.  You're going to destroy the economy with your tariffs.  Gas prices are higher, ins. prems. higher, commodities higher.  Your con job with the so-called tax "cut" is just that, a con job.  Resign @POTUS

146 2018-07-17 14:52:49 Is inflation of commodities a cause or an effect in raising the minimum wage? #wages #chickenandegg #Thinkingaloud #braindead #FirstWorldProblems
147 2018-07-17 14:45:09 It’s #NationalEmojiDay and Farm Credit  our customers and the commodities they serve 
148 2018-07-17 14:43:29 I don't think that is the case. The government is benefiting from extra $$$ earned by exporting oil & other commodities. However, this extra money is channeled into offshore tax heavens, and population is taxed even more.
149 2018-07-17 14:42:59 Ok but you invoked them. No need to have a hard border or be a member of CU for those commodities trades then. I think we can manage without Baileys and I am sure ROI can supply the milk - if necessary UK can  support to those farms affected on NI side. Not being in a CU for that
150 2018-07-17 14:34:45 So an FTA would cover Electricity, oil, gas and so forth as they are all international commodities - can't see a particular dependancy on a border except say petrol tankers for garages. should be easy enough to reroute that supply. If no FTA these can be handled w/o border issues
151 2018-07-17 14:33:50 @SenSherrodBrown asks about rules on investments in physical commodities. Do you see any urgency on rules?  #Powell could not respond and said it had to go look and see where things stand.
152 2018-07-17 14:33:15 Fed Powell isn't focused on rule to limit bank control of stuff (commodities).
153 2018-07-17 14:33:03 The idea that oppression should be measured primarily in the access a certain group has to commodities is, surprise, exactly the logic of all those companies you hate for hijacking pride
154 2018-07-17 14:32:52 The Single Market and the CU! Free movement of goods and services. Electricity, oil, gas are all commodities traded freely within the EU and subject to FTAs or tariffs without.
155 2018-07-17 14:32:43 Commodities must be suppressed using HFT/Collusion along with interest rates or the Fragility of our system comes into the Light of Day.

163 2018-07-17 14:04:24 The EU trade policy is tremendously unfair to many countries particularly Africa forcing them to remain in poverty. They have low tarrifs on commodities and raw materials from Africa but hammer Them the second they try to add value and sell processed products
164 2018-07-17 14:01:09 Whilst I do believe the decision to ban unnecessary commodities such as plastic straws is the correct one, I am optimistic that measures will be put in place to ensure people who need them, get them.
165 2018-07-17 14:00:23 Reminder: commodities are the inverse of technological progress. They go down in real terms over time as technology makes us more efficient and develops substitutes
166 2018-07-17 14:00:02 Commodities: Coffee -2.09%, Wheat +1.64%
167 2018-07-17 13:59:36 No bottom anywhere in $GOLD or $SILVER With all the manipulation these commodities are untradable.
168 2018-07-17 13:59:12 "Already" because the cost of REproduction of software & "content" is near zero. Not true of hardware, let alone all other less zeitgeisty commodities & associated logistics. It's *because* yr point about post/scarcity does matter that circumspection/recomplication is needed.[>
169 2018-07-17 13:58:23 Yeah. I agree. I feel like the Gruul would take most offense to the fandom because they feel like they took their shamanic ritualistic stuff and turned it into a commercial thing. Where commodities are bought and sold.

If they're there, careful they don't burn the con down

172 2018-07-17 13:50:35 I agree! Purchasing power of the peso is way down. I am always amused whenever my DDS sister laments about the increased prices of  and other commodities and I always tell her: ginusto nyo yan di ba, change pa more! Sabi ko Federalism, you like? ++
173 2018-07-17 13:47:49 jpm, morgan stanley and citi must be happy that GS commodities fate has been sealed
174 2018-07-17 13:44:10 Neither does live in prison.  Specially when tax payers pay for their meals, recreation, and living commodities. Also the punishment isn't to just execute the criminal, but to give closure to the families who were left behind.
Criminals of with Capital Punishment have no rights.
175 2018-07-17 13:32:22 The system has been designed to keep prices low so that this bubble economy can stay afloat. Most commodities are produced at a loss & that is how they want it. They aren't thinking about the consequences of the future,  just anything to keep the everything bubble alive.
176 2018-07-17 13:23:41 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
177 2018-07-17 13:16:37 The journos you quoted are all sellable commodities with a very low price. NS on the other hand is known to buy the loyalties of people in the blink of an eye.

247 2018-07-17 06:28:14 The primordial concern at present is that the country need  more jobs and affordable prices of prime commodities, not a new constitution.
248 2018-07-17 05:55:25 As for your question, I do think that the issue is particularly dire in borrowing from econ: neoclassical claims are built on long chain of defeasible predicates (if the whole economy is made of commodities, then...) and if you don't get your key concepts right 1/2

257 2018-07-17 04:55:52 Shaming men for not "achieving" sex reinforces patriarchy. 
1. It's a tool that is used to maintain toxic masculinity, and the idea that sex is male conquest. 
2. Makes women out to be commodities for men to consume as some kind of badge of valor.

279 2018-07-17 02:20:41 Agree no need to be rude. We're not enemies. But to the point about batteries, if Munro is right (and Boss thinks Munro is fullnog shit, so query) then batteries are not commodities. I care about battery degradation and so on. Iland assume most buyers have a brain
280 2018-07-17 02:12:24 And the battery. Says best of breed. If (if!) he's right, that's important bc many have argued "anyone can just buy from Panasonic. Battwries are commodities." At least interesting if not important

285 2018-07-17 01:30:31 Yes we are very much invested in being fetishized commodities 
286 2018-07-17 01:03:42 The ask prices for commodities will eat through those wages in 2-3 years then you are back to square 1. Living expenses go up with the minimum wage. It's not only predictable its historically provable.
287 2018-07-17 01:00:20 I've long believed that marketing jobs will eventually go away as more and more of those traits and responsibilities will be transitioned to the founders and product managers. Granted this only applies to hit companies and commodities like Tesla and Google or Coke and McDonalds.

294 2018-07-17 00:09:50 Pun/ Subsequently, price wars make commodities, by definition, and it’s detrimental to growth. If two organizations compete for the same product or service, they can avoid a price car, in turn commoditizing, by offering betta or different  stuff, which is the crux of this chart.

297 2018-07-17 00:04:42 Oh it’s worse than that. They want to take away the right to free speech because apparently they “own” the artists. They think of the artists they watch and listen to as commodities, not people - as their own personal slaves.
