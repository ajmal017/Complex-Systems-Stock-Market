1 2018-12-18 23:54:35 I wouldn't trust about bitcoin, not today
$Silver and $gold will go up...
$OIL and $copper among other commodities will go down
if interest rates gets higher will be more interesting, and stock market will keep going down
2 2018-12-18 23:35:33 They talk on rice  price but other commodities like wheat  Maize  yam   Price has dropped down
3 2018-12-18 23:32:57 Yes Ma'am. Stocks, ETFs, Indices, commodities, currencies, and crypto. :)
4 2018-12-18 23:22:05 Get him out and let him be someone else’s problem but as mentioned they are huge commodities now and managers get those decisions taken out of their hands now
5 2018-12-18 23:20:01 i think about how in modern days, most se asians men/women can’t get a white partner without them having the “yellow fever”. we’re not exotic commodities
6 2018-12-18 23:13:11 Too hubris in your last answer, USD is the world's reserve currency "exorbitant privilege", commodities are priced on USD and well-developed bond market together with strong financial institutions including the autonomous FED and trust. Safe-haven currencies as JPY and CHF...

8 2018-12-18 23:06:08 It's (only) useful from a fiscal point of view. Most of your products would be subject to sanitary checks anyway, which CTC does not remove or facilitate, so I think in your case the benefits from a speed of border crossing pt of view will be more limited than other commodities
9 2018-12-18 22:59:15 Many #MATs follow the #SportsDirect model for success; solely concerned with performance data & profits with little thought given to wellbeing of pupils & staff, who are treated as commodities.
Our #academy values inclusion, equality, & democracy for all its students & staff.
10 2018-12-18 22:58:04 You are wrong mate  the lenders will manipulate the banking system into raising rates and the government into increasing prices of certain commodities (already happening with gas and fuels). Lenders' agenda is to milk the ordinary folks dry.
11 2018-12-18 22:55:11 Completely agree with you. Dating apps have turned our lives into commodities and us into products, further complicating the already mysterious process of falling in love.
12 2018-12-18 22:46:56 Some nuances: many crypto assets (Ether) are *not* trying to compete with fiat (the dollar), and would prefer to be compared with oil or other commodities. In the 125 Ethereum meetups I've held I have not suggested that Ethereum (or Bitcoin) could compete with the dollar.
13 2018-12-18 22:41:08 You’re a fine girl l, ok i don’t have money. You people are now commodities

15 2018-12-18 22:35:28 @JayBusbee elbowing to get in players locker rooms. Talking about "I have access" , "I'm supposed to be in there!" 

 Be in there with who?

With viable commodities, BUT ONLY the football perspective
16 2018-12-18 22:30:54 The whole market is long USD$ and short commodities, especially oil.  

I'm all for green energy, but shoving greenbacks into my gas tank won't work!
17 2018-12-18 22:29:09 What are all things made from?
Commodities.
What are commodities priced in?
Dollars 
*shakes head slowly*

Anyone who thinks a #NodealBrexit is somehow going to enhance their life is either very rich or very deluded, incredibly ignorant or any combination of all three.
18 2018-12-18 22:26:25 But it’s not outrageous- virtually every Wall St. firm is calling god weak dollar high commodities- long gold. BTW - miss u Henrik!
19 2018-12-18 22:22:44 Any chance gold will decouple from other declining commodities, Luke, or be different from the no bid/ dead market scenario you’ve outlined?  Thanks
