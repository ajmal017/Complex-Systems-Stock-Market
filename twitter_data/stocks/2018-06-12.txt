5 2018-06-12 23:57:00 I’m not taking out a 300k loan to invest. I’m just deciding to not pay off my mortgage right now. I could buy dividends stocks and out perform 2.5%. Also I can buy my company stock options and make even more.

10 2018-06-12 23:52:58 I think we should test 3 stocks first. I'm on the fence but I think 3 could work when the final game is out.
11 2018-06-12 23:52:03 Bump stocks don’t even fucking modify fire rate
12 2018-06-12 23:51:27 Bump stocks don’t make a weapon rapid fire
13 2018-06-12 23:51:00 All bump stocks do is allow u to fire more accurately, and even then it’s not that significant, u can bump fire without s special stock and firing fast is just havig a trigger finger
14 2018-06-12 23:50:31 I keep telling myself man I should invest in Nintendo stocks before E3 but every year I forget my own advice and Nintendo stock jumps up like 20%
15 2018-06-12 23:50:14 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
16 2018-06-12 23:50:02 I feel the same way about my Halloween masks and Santa hats.. and the google stocks I passed on hahahaha

37 2018-06-12 23:47:57 Well guess what #nevertrumpers?  You were so wrong, desperately wrong. 
Your shame should be bottomless.   Bill Kristol, Max Boot, all of you
stand up and please voluntarily go into the stocks and throw rotten veggies at
yourselves.   You should be ashamed to speak.

40 2018-06-12 23:45:54 I vote 3 stocks from the start
41 2018-06-12 23:45:21 I don’t mind ppl expressing their views on here like I do but when you say stupid things like the economy & stocks are doing terrible & you bash @potus, I unfollow you. Sorry @RealKevinNash
42 2018-06-12 23:44:55 All other media stocks like DIS and CMSCA  are down. Is CBS a takeover target?
43 2018-06-12 23:44:26 if its the speed and strength as was shown at the invitational, 3+ stocks.

however, I'm pretty certain they're going to tweak that a bit, so who knows?
44 2018-06-12 23:43:48 after long time stock charts looking good today specially financial stocks!! Hope this MID cap up move will continue!!
45 2018-06-12 23:43:00 So ya’ll just gonna be out here puttin’ cresses in ya’ll dead stocks? Okay Sis. 
46 2018-06-12 23:42:59 What happened to plup is the equivolent of a new player picking kirby in melee for fun then getting visciously shine spiked 4 stocks in a row. Welcome to the game, kid.
47 2018-06-12 23:42:58 My dad was pretty organized with all that but still just didn’t have it all laid out. An old credit union account from the 70s was left open, paper stocks, a small life insurance I’m not even sure he knew about from his retirement etc.
48 2018-06-12 23:42:56 That's a relief. I was super concerned that our gummy bear stocks had been corrupted. Thanks for taking 1 for the team.
49 2018-06-12 23:42:43 Poverty sucks. Its why I work and have 4 side hustles. Gotta adapt. Wanna change things then you need to invest in your future whether its your health or even stocks. Elon is doing exactly that.
50 2018-06-12 23:42:35 Not only that Exxon is no longer the biggest company in the US.  Technology sector stocks have past them by
51 2018-06-12 23:42:11 Lógico amigas amigos y amigues!  Yo hable de terrorismo meteorológico!  Y a algunos no les gustó.  Era una talla, pero  tenía mucho de verdad! Creo fue para q  se agotarán los stocks de botas velas estufas y parkas.
52 2018-06-12 23:41:44 Don't underestimate survivorship bias.  Stocks go up over time, because the bad ones go broke and get de-listed.
53 2018-06-12 23:41:10 He is taking about bump stocks tard
54 2018-06-12 23:41:08 There's no logic at this point of the crypto game, it's still too shallow as a market.Old stocks have been manipulated before and they were 25 times bigger than the 400B crypto's worth today. Investing today's about believing in the tech. The risk's great but that's how you win.
55 2018-06-12 23:40:38 That game is so fast, and it’s not even optimized yet. 3 stocks.
56 2018-06-12 23:39:28 as the owner of a couple Netflix stocks i'll take full credit for this and accept my thanks in Beer, Roses, Cash and Rooneys (No Waynes please)
57 2018-06-12 23:37:52 I'm hoping Smash Ultimate has 3 or more stocks for tournaments.
58 2018-06-12 23:36:49 I said this before~many companies just let their employees go. At least he is looking out for them via salary and stocks. I know ppl who put in 15 years and was laid off and hears other similar stories. They were left to struggle.
59 2018-06-12 23:36:48 I dont think they were at the level for Sheik to be effective enough against Sonic. It took ZeRo so long to kill with her, when Sonic was ending stocks at just 110%. Down the line Sheik will prolly rule over Sonic again, but it was way safer to pick Mario at their current level.
60 2018-06-12 23:35:04 I don't know 3 stocks seemed fine to me, but we won't really know until December 7th
61 2018-06-12 23:34:18 Add wavedashing cause getting out of tight situations will be essential.  And if you roll then you’re punishing your roll later on.    

Also make it so you can kill way easier wtf.   End of stocks get dragged on so much.
62 2018-06-12 23:33:52 Nasdaq  Stocks, up for the day.
7,703.79 ▲+43.87+0.577,703.79 Down about even. DJT My President.
63 2018-06-12 23:32:27 The Saudi prince & Bibi are also among the worst. You want to know who is THE worst? The US/UK military complex. That is the Beast of End Time. It's us. Trump isn't helping in most instances. In #NorthKoreaSummit he isn't hurting. Go figure. The #MIC is outraged. Stocks tanking.
64 2018-06-12 23:32:23 Best stocks under$10 (June 12): $CYCC, $TEUM, $VEON, $OTIC, $ESTE, $CRBP
65 2018-06-12 23:32:18 That's a big punch in the face for all those shorting @Tesla #tsla stocks
66 2018-06-12 23:32:10 True true, but that doesn’t really matter, why would u take away violent video games because David cuck is taking away bump stocks?
67 2018-06-12 23:32:02 I’m conservative as hell  @brianstelter. Just checked my stocks and seems I now own you.
68 2018-06-12 23:32:00 Diversify your #investments that include a broad mix of stocks and bonds. Have an exit strategy to manage your risk.
69 2018-06-12 23:31:21 I would only support banning ARs as defined by the 2017 federal bill, but I’d also support banning high-capacity mags and bump stocks. I support univ background checks as well
70 2018-06-12 23:31:04 Why should I, as Greek and anyone who had over the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with the team captain, was killed and enemy combatants pouring into our  meetings only to our Agriculture!
71 2018-06-12 23:30:07 All this hate towards our president for a simple grammar error. Who cares the economy is racing along unemployment is at a all time low stocks are way up North Korea is in negotiations. Explain to me how he is failing you
72 2018-06-12 23:28:02 Final thoughts on Smash Ultimate: It looks amazing. I love how fast paced it is and I hope three stocks is the norm for singles. Can’t wait to get my hands on it in the future! ...but please nerf Bayo lmao 
73 2018-06-12 23:27:14 David,David, David, what a miserable little boy you must be. Bump stocks can be and are being hand made. How can you police them? Murder is illegal and we've not gotten that stopped. Your "lime light" will soon become old news what will you do then?
74 2018-06-12 23:26:22 Hey Jim. Took me a while, but I just finished Getting Rich Carefully. My father discouraged my becoming a basketball coach, then pursuing my Ph.D. He also discouraged my from investing in stocks.
75 2018-06-12 23:25:57 But this book I bought on the Interwebs said RSI would make me RICH- especially if I used on crytpocurrencies and pot stocks!
76 2018-06-12 23:25:47 Help! Millennials "Hand-Crafted" My Blue Chip Stocks !!
77 2018-06-12 23:25:20 I know people with a lot of money who don’t want to get “dumped” on. So they put their money in stocks.

83 2018-06-12 23:17:56 ZERO GOT THE FIRST TWO STOCKS OFF MKLEO FINAL DESTINATION REALLY WAS A GREAT COUNTER PICK
84 2018-06-12 23:17:49 The weird stuff that's in the game make it unique, there are some other core differences: it's more heavily about combos and it's faster (4 stocks vs 2/3). Ultimately though the unique weirdness of melee means the melee community probably won't ever play a new Smash game.
85 2018-06-12 23:17:42 Well there's stocks and when you're in a hurry! Lmfao 
86 2018-06-12 23:16:35 Stocks singles to right field, Bentley advances from 1 to 3, Shoars scores from 3, Kiewiet scores from 2! 
87 2018-06-12 23:16:23 makes sense - large companies' growth have limits that smaller companies do not have.  Main point - invest in stocks (preferably indexed funds!
88 2018-06-12 23:16:02 The American Medical Association has voted to endorse a total ban on assault weapons and bump stocks as part its effort to combat the epidemic of gun violence.

95 2018-06-12 23:10:37 2 MORE STOCKS ZERO COME ON
96 2018-06-12 23:10:18 Facts! I have watched at least one trader bank $3k+ per trade on 20-30 cent moves, but they have 3k or more shares at a time trading higher ATR stocks. Nothing wrong with picking up smaller profits along the way until they are willing to risk more capital over time.
97 2018-06-12 23:09:28 3 stocks seem to take too long
98 2018-06-12 23:06:50 I’m pro gun and all but how would banning bump stocks lead to the banning of semi-automatic rifles?
99 2018-06-12 23:06:41 Why not Las Vegas? Then the GOP can try and explain why they can’t even pass a law to get rid of bump stocks.
100 2018-06-12 23:05:46 I got my stocks and now I'm deciding on quitting my job by starting a fire tbh
101 2018-06-12 23:04:09 Yea.. Beat, beat on rev and eps with an immediate share plummet seems to be the pattern of many stocks these days.  Conference call began how much after the earnings were announced tho?  lol.  There’s always a story
102 2018-06-12 23:03:24 You must not have stocks. Too bad.
103 2018-06-12 23:02:37 Really??

104 2018-06-12 23:01:29 Lol I'm just assuming but I expect Comcast to make a bid tomorrow, maybe Disney can offer more stocks to up their value but they can't compete with cash that's for sure
105 2018-06-12 23:01:27 In #SmashBrosUltimate You survive to high percents but everything does so much damage that it seems like matches are going to take about the same amount of neutral wins to take a game. Might be able to move to 3 stocks b/c defensive options don't seem as good so matches are fast.
106 2018-06-12 23:01:22 I had to track down a ton n of papers stocks. DM me the company I may be able to help you.
107 2018-06-12 22:59:14 I like how those AMD stocks are performing. So nice. #investments #AMD #stocks
108 2018-06-12 22:58:13 If it was stocks, DK SD’d like 4 times at the start. It’d be a 2v1 at the most. Nairo can do that vs most competitive players. So you’re talking stock and player handicap for it to become “fair” which they don’t want to do.
109 2018-06-12 22:56:50 I think we’re gonna be using 3 stocks
110 2018-06-12 22:56:18 Awesome video. I had no idea Brazil & South Africa are the weaker foreign markets currently. AT&T & Time Warner decision was made in favor of the merger after market closed today. Therefore media stocks are likely to be in play tomorrow.UR trade idea on $FB bull put spread!
111 2018-06-12 22:56:09 Guys this game is easily fast enough to play 4 stocks again.
112 2018-06-12 22:55:56 @Mahi_Mahi once this aker fiasco is over I am gonna have to change things up. But for now I'm riding this stocks to the bowels of hell :)
113 2018-06-12 22:54:59 theyve been randomly switching between 3 stocks and 4. What is determining that?
114 2018-06-12 22:54:48 I love the little character portraits for the stocks!
115 2018-06-12 22:53:40 Yea I'm saying if it was stocks, I feel like the 3 would have had a better chance to actually win which would have been neat. I'm not saying it shouldn't have been 3v1.
116 2018-06-12 22:52:55 The top 10% of American households, as defined by total wealth, now own 84% of all stocks. The bottom 90 percent own the rest. That's absolutely staggering. So when someone says the economy is good, it's good for the top 10%.
117 2018-06-12 22:52:31 @ATFHQ Can't submit a comment on regarding bump stocks because your system is is down/says there is error.

I oppose any new gun restriction and regulation including this one as it is unconstitutional. NO BUMP STOCK REGULATIONS.
118 2018-06-12 22:51:06 Nah dude, it's a time match. 1 person to take stocks off of vs 3, plus the less skilled players SD'ing multiple times probably.
119 2018-06-12 22:50:43 Time for members of this corrupt administration and family to buy defense stocks before tweeting threats.
120 2018-06-12 22:50:29 how was that 3v1 a handicap if it's time lmao.  shoulda been stocks if they wanted them to have anything close to a chance
121 2018-06-12 22:50:26 *So far, ridley looks like the next charizard
*they brought ember moon in to play smash lol....
*lucha pikachu costume cute af
*snake fair split spike still as disrespectful as ever
*Nairo won a 3v1 vs celebs 
*nairo picked his nose in between stocks on camera, it was funny.
122 2018-06-12 22:50:20  Have a look these #stocks that hit record highs: $GPRK
123 2018-06-12 22:50:19 I put my corn in about 2 weeks ado. And planted the beans around the same time.
Mind you, those stocks are about 4 weeks old. Started them under lights inside. And our weather has been cooler lately. 
But they are hanging in there.
124 2018-06-12 22:50:15 Mercado de Chicago, impacto positivo.
El USDA anuncio recortes en los stocks norteamericanos  de maiz , trigo y soja, debido a una mayor molienda interna.
125 2018-06-12 22:50:02 Why he keep saying they’re taking stocks? It’s clearly a time match.
126 2018-06-12 22:50:00 I feel like this 3v1 should have been stocks, time just let Nairo have more points.
127 2018-06-12 22:49:05 Searching For These Classes Is Like Searching For Dead Stocks
128 2018-06-12 22:48:03 EMBER KEEPS GETTING THE STOCKS WITH ITEMS
SHE HAS THE UNDERSTANDING
129 2018-06-12 22:47:57 yeah they shoulda done like 5 stocks... this is better for nairo since its time lol
130 2018-06-12 22:47:41 25 of the 95 stocks we selected for Invest by @rubicoin are up over 100% since they were published. Or, over 26% of our picks are at least two-baggers.
131 2018-06-12 22:46:45 Agreed; lowering taxes expands business. *Ex; current economic boom* 
The main objective of a business is their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to create profit. 55% of Americans own stocks- As American families wealth grows they will support charity for homeless
132 2018-06-12 22:45:47 oh its timed, not with stocks. Erm that makes it easier for Nairo
133 2018-06-12 22:44:45 Wait no stocks? Oh Nairo has this free
134 2018-06-12 22:44:28 I just remembered that I used to work around the corner from a bar called Stocks and Blondes and now I can't think about anything else.
135 2018-06-12 22:44:15 And what exactly did obama do? My retirement fund and stocks sucked under him.  My real estate value did not do much.  Job market poor.  Oil prices up down up up up down..   military stripped of needed artillery etc, trump gets in and within two months - we are strong again.

138 2018-06-12 22:42:29 hey man, I've been listening to your show for 2 years because it was a smart/fun take on sports. that being said, you also got me into making money whether stocks or sports gambling. thank you @ClayTravis for having the smartest show on the radio.  #loyaloutkickfan
139 2018-06-12 22:41:46 Crypto is getting DESTROYED! 
This is really not good. I am totally willing to go down with the ship but lets be real...this is not good. I have bought stocks that have dropped 50-60% before...I average down and then WAIT...sometimes YEARS. We shall see.
140 2018-06-12 22:41:35 $VCTL love the way .006 held today. I think I'll be adding more soon
141 2018-06-12 22:41:10 They are on the stock exchange..  We need to educate the new patients who still have money to buy stocks in the pharm companies so they make money and dont go broke
142 2018-06-12 22:41:04 I’m not confused. The numbers don’t lie. I have more money in my pocket all the stocks I own are at all time highs unemployment is down. Well I am confused at how that doesn’t make sense to you??? #MAGA
143 2018-06-12 22:41:02 It blows my mind that traders would rather spend countless hours trading triple zero stocks than just learn how to trade options

I don't hold individual stocks to prevent conflicts of interest/violate normal journalistic rules
149 2018-06-12 22:38:38 I never knew after market wheels would give me such a headache Going back to stocks !!

151 2018-06-12 22:37:46 That must include a massive shift of current stocks into cryptocurrency format. But yes it will happen. HODL.
152 2018-06-12 22:37:33 Yeah, a lot of these little things like the dramatic slowdown/zoom in, tags by the characters/stocks, and screen score after every KO seem to have been done exclusively for viewers. Very impressed.
153 2018-06-12 22:37:28 This is all wrong. Feet are bony with little meat and only good for stocks.
154 2018-06-12 22:36:38 Man the only thing I'm sad about in regards to Smash is that I wish they changed up how you can get Final Smashes in Items Off games. It'll be marked off, so that's a whole entire flashy feature in the game left disregarded.

Would've liked if it was a Comeback feature in stocks.
155 2018-06-12 22:36:34 When 7-10 tech stocks become the entire market, how do you think that ends when 3-4 of them all miss earnings during the same quarter?  I think you make a very valid point, but won't these companies just engage in stock buybacks to elevate earnings? We miss @EconMatters videos!!
156 2018-06-12 22:33:12 @Canada cannabis stocks. Is all the hype real?
157 2018-06-12 22:33:04 To be fair, these stocks have run up so much that it’s prudent for them to take some $$ off the table.

189 2018-06-12 22:17:26 Good time to buy defense stocks.
190 2018-06-12 22:16:25 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your chronic fatigue
191 2018-06-12 22:15:48 If anything the situation of "equity positions" is the opposite of what's been advanced as an unsubstantiated conjecture here. Universities have endowments that hold Pharma stocks. If anything is less than arms-length, drug manufacturers actually work for universities.
192 2018-06-12 22:14:25 Get your stocks in check because @ATT  and @twxcorp  has merged so stocks will jump after this merge

217 2018-06-12 22:00:56 That big pop up of stocks is pretty hype though. Not necessary, but it helps build hype real good. real esports now? #SmashBrosUltimate
218 2018-06-12 22:00:50 A background check is a hell of a lot different than wanting to confiscate certain rifles, limit magazine capacity, ban bump stocks, ect. Improving on already existing laws would more than suffice, that I don't disagree with. Beyond that is giving an inch that will lead to a mile
219 2018-06-12 22:00:50 "Aggressive Play is more rewarded"

I really hope that ends up being the case, I got really annoyed about how defensive Smash 4 was online (though a lot of that probably had to do with the final destination stages being the only stages you could use in stocks online)
220 2018-06-12 22:00:39 I like the 1v1 stock thing where it shows remaining stocks in between lives. I like all the small changes to encourage competitive 1v1 play
221 2018-06-12 22:00:30 yeah I think that's a good philosophy. especially people who may not have the time to research all these stocks.

229 2018-06-12 21:52:11 Depending on buying pressure you could add .04s to that list as well.  We traded 26m in less than 2 hours, was 20m before the volume kicked in.  The hint becomes the chase at the snap of a fingers on stocks like these.
230 2018-06-12 21:52:07 Stocks are up for AT&T however 
231 2018-06-12 21:51:59 Though I've kind of gone from liking rodinal stand (or half stand, 1:50 30min, extra agitation) best for old stocks to a stronger developer to get more punchy negatives. What are your thoughts? Do you like to vary any?

237 2018-06-12 21:46:41 Today stocks of weapons contractors tanked because there may be peace b/t the US & North Korea. While media treat this like a quizzical oddity, it in fact shows that our economic system rewards profit-by-murder over peace. This is a red alarm that we live in a death economy.
238 2018-06-12 21:46:38 Only about 50 points up since this tweet. You coming over to the good side yet, or remaining bearish as the strongest stocks continue to reach ATHs?  I’m still short volatility, still long market leaders.

The ultrarich know that stocks are going to hell in a hand basket. Soon. It's the deficit driven by the #TaxScam

282 2018-06-12 21:30:15 Wat of VVD gets injured? Look at city Chelsea man u and you see Rocks as CBs while we have laughing stocks as CBs hoping for VVD to contest for every challenge in order for us to have hope of winning!
283 2018-06-12 21:30:12 How about the congressman who has the inside info to make tons on stocks? Maybe the poor soul trying to stay clean who needs some assistance with Medicaid.
284 2018-06-12 21:29:00 Sold my stocks in @Dropbox and @Ford to acquire @ATT stocks ahead of the judges ruling great profits to come i hope
285 2018-06-12 21:28:56 Pog and talk about stocks maybe
286 2018-06-12 21:28:28 The real question is whether or not we're running 3 stocks in the this game

295 2018-06-12 21:21:36 Just like everyone else. Equifax didnt know how to secure the data of *half the population of of the US*, kept it a secret for month while the C-level execs were selling off stocks (insider trading-Martha did hard time for that) and now yet again they have been insider trading
296 2018-06-12 21:21:25 Most likely due to the stocks not ripping post ipo.   Could be buy the rumor sell the news as well
297 2018-06-12 21:21:12 that cretin wells needs to be taught civility humility and most importantly how it feels to be dragged from our parliament as she heads to the stocks in the #grassmarket

302 2018-06-12 21:18:41 Russell 5000 is small business stocks, it was brutalized during the Obama years, now it’s surging, small business does most of the hiring and training...also you have a huge influx of capital investments which means companies and businesses are expanding their capacity and hiring

306 2018-06-12 21:14:46 No, they've had years, haven't produced any restrictions, we don't need ar-15s on the street for the common man. And if we do want to allow that then they don't need the bump stocks.

Or how about a mental health bill? Anything besides thoughts and prayers would be nice.
307 2018-06-12 21:14:33 Do I know anyone who writes for @FullFrontalSamB ?? I wonder if they'd like to interview a relatively funny, passably charming trans guy who is running for the state house against a man who voted to keep conversion therapy and bump stocks. . .

314 2018-06-12 21:09:20 Odd that u draw that conclusion from my comment. Back to beginning. Very wealthy growing faster than others bc of major positions in stocks and real estate.
315 2018-06-12 21:08:33 I’m not, I know I might not win but I’m taking some of y’all stocks

317 2018-06-12 21:07:03 Think this game needs 4 stocks
318 2018-06-12 21:05:57 I was looking over my stocks & holy cow, they’re pretty high right now. I don’t know wether to sell them or wait for an increase. This is the highest I’ve seen it & I’m paranoid the value will drop but also don’t want to regret it if the value increases too IDK what to do 
319 2018-06-12 21:05:43 Lmao I bought stocks from AT&T nearly 6 years ago & first thought it wasn’t gonna make me money, but now with this merger

334 2018-06-12 21:02:04 Será mañana? Bueno tenemos 3 días por delante, pero el cierre en máximos de hoy me hace pensar que mañana será buen día. Petará en breve. Ajusten órdenes de compra sino están dentro.
335 2018-06-12 21:01:35 Funny enough, Disney could just scare Comcast off by making a counter-offer that Comcast can’t risk being in anymore debt.  Comcast’s stocks have actually gone down since declaring their intentions to outbid Disney.

Club BB f*cked with democracy and free speech once too often. 1 million of them wouldn't make 1 @potus
338 2018-06-12 21:01:07 I've always found growth stocks are priced to perfection. The slightest sign of a hiccup and you're looking at a 30% or more drop. At some point growth must transition to sustainability and that's when you can expect a real valuation. Thanks @Greenbackd

347 2018-06-12 20:59:37 Gas prices UP
Food prices UP
Prescription prices UP

Big Biz used the #TaxScam to buy back stocks instead of increase wages or benefits for employees. Gave bigger bonuses to Top Execs. 
Nothing done about offshore tax haven loopholes. 

The stock market is not the economy.
348 2018-06-12 20:58:26 Now we must buy the remaining 498 stocks.
349 2018-06-12 20:57:51 slowly but surely getting darker

354 2018-06-12 20:57:10 The debt burden also impedes income diversion to "retirement accounts" because many people logically prefer the guaranteed return on investment that comes from paying off debt versus the uncertain return associated with stocks. Current generation has seen two 50% market wipeouts.

356 2018-06-12 20:56:39 If you know anything about guns you’d know that bump stocks are garbage and raising the purchase age of firearms is absolutely stupid.
357 2018-06-12 20:56:23 That's the good part of what'll be the new meta. Disadvantage is bad across the board, and will be less polarizing with more stocks and a more evened out neutral game:punish game ratio. I'm loving it.
358 2018-06-12 20:55:50 Wonder if shorting CRISPR stocks based on a bioRxiv preprint constitutes insider trading
359 2018-06-12 20:55:20 Then why did you legalize bump stocks?
360 2018-06-12 20:53:59 they laughed at us for not beating sevilla in the group stage then got eliminated by them
United have really turned themselves into laughing stocks
since ferguson left
361 2018-06-12 20:53:36 Now invest those $450 into stocks
362 2018-06-12 20:53:16 I understand the license problem but why limit the quantities?
Because with more stocks, us (Europeans) could have imported them?
(even if it was more expensive like the sh figuarts for example).
Here the limitation is only good for the speculators. 
363 2018-06-12 20:52:34 ban bump stocks
364 2018-06-12 20:52:14 How many stocks for 1v1?
365 2018-06-12 20:51:31 seems like 4 stocks
366 2018-06-12 20:51:26 Don't own any stocks. But I invest heavily in Gary U.S. Bonds.
367 2018-06-12 20:51:15 It is officially open season on media M&A. Watch the media stocks rise in extended hours.
368 2018-06-12 20:51:01 Btw...
2 stocks ???
3stock ???
4 stocks !?!?
369 2018-06-12 20:51:01 I can foresee competitive Smash Ultimate being on a higher stock count. Possibly back to 4 stocks.

EVERYTHING DOES SO MUCH DAMAGE
370 2018-06-12 20:50:37 Your 401(k)'s and other investments were likely at "record highs" too during Obama. Many large cap stocks are higher because the companies are using their tax breaks for share buybacks instead of investing in their companies. Jack up share values for the corporate officers. 1/2
371 2018-06-12 20:50:03 Why does Link explode after he gets stabbed by Ridley's tail in the trailer? Does it Instantly KO at a specific percent? Or is it is it an updated Stamina mode where you have stocks and explode when you run out of stamina? 

#SmashBrosUltimate #NintendoE3 #Ridley
372 2018-06-12 20:49:54 Getting some questions on the difference between crude and cushing #'s
Crude is total crude stocks of all grades in the US 
Cushing is the actual $CL_F #WTI contract that most trade, this is all grades stored specifically at Cushing
373 2018-06-12 20:49:19 With the way Smash 4 1v1 matches being a bit prolonged that it needed be 2 stocks the same way BBTAG are making 3 out of 5 the standard competetive setting, I imagine they wanted to adjust that a bit while decreasing damage in FFAs. An interesting change but wonder 2v2s are like.
374 2018-06-12 20:49:16 Excellent day for Watch List stocks: reloading opps on $IJJP, $HIHI, $OTTV, $APRU, $BTGI, $BLLB, $DGWR & $TMPS.

375 2018-06-12 20:48:24 I've shined spiked so many stocks in your name.
376 2018-06-12 20:48:17 AT&T/TIME WARNER HAS JUST BEEN APPROVED! 
Glad judge waited until after stock market, stocks will sore in next few days and Trump won't get in on the gain, like he hoped!
377 2018-06-12 20:48:12 That's why I'm only giving this stock until Thursday. If I stuck with my last two stocks, I would have seen solid 20% gains. But it's not always that way.
378 2018-06-12 20:48:06 Time Warner stocks TWX up by 0.05%
379 2018-06-12 20:46:00 Today, Representative @keithellison  introduced the #RewardWorkAct which would prevent companies from buying back their own stocks on the open market and require that workers have a voice on corporate boards. Thank you @keithellison for fighting for workers!

384 2018-06-12 20:44:09 I know I post obsessively about @Snap but believe me, there's no better case study right now to learn product, design, tech, business, advertising, media, strategy, stocks, and a value of a grand long term vision. Everything at once.
385 2018-06-12 20:44:02 Well guess what #nevertrumpers?  You were so wrong, desperately wrong. 
Your shame should be bottomless.   Bill Kristol, Max Boot, all of you
stand up and please voluntarily go into the stocks and throw rotten veggies at
yourselves.   You should be ashamed to speak.
386 2018-06-12 20:44:02 @TweekSsb how many stocks should be played?
387 2018-06-12 20:43:41 Not really - bump stocks don't have springs or any moving parts.  Still ridiculous.

392 2018-06-12 20:42:56 You don't need to ban us! Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat all kept us around. You're literally the only platform I use that is doing this! I'm old enough to have stocks in your company best believe I'm selling those off soon.

399 2018-06-12 20:37:30 This chart.  Minsky crack up boom in the FANG stocks. Tightening. Money velocity up. Inflation up. Reminds me of December 1999. This sucker has to be close to blowing up. Got gold?
400 2018-06-12 20:36:18 As far as I understand. Bump stocks are no longer being sold publicly?

407 2018-06-12 20:34:20 Because bump stocks don't do what CNN says they do. Also, did you know a lot of what you want are shot down by the dems?

410 2018-06-12 20:33:45 I know summer just started, but 2018 summer so far has been great. 2nd place in my golf tournament, getting my AA degree in psychology, and making some new business transactions with the cryptocurrencies and stocks. Life is good. #motivation #inspiration.

443 2018-06-12 20:18:01 This is how Paul Tudor Jones sees the bull market in US stocks ending later this year:

"So, yes I think this is going to end with a lot higher prices and forcing the fed to shut it off."

Dow slips 1.58 points, -0.01% to 25,320.

467 2018-06-12 20:03:29 IMO the best way to get news is the CNBC app. Push alerts are super fast. And it’s good for tracking stocks. Get it in the App Store.

Too many book on amazon to just pick one. So before I do, does anyone have any recommendations?
478 2018-06-12 19:57:19 Who said eliminating the BOR? Common sense would be getting rid of bump stocks, laser sights, extended clips etc. Or making it harder for violent offenders or mentally ill people to obtain weapons of death. Also, it says "well regulated" in the 2A. They are not well regulated

482 2018-06-12 19:53:48 You are right. I'm buying their stocks.
483 2018-06-12 19:53:33 When I think of the very core of why stocks go up over time, inflation, innovation and population come to mind. If the same product costs more in the future (inflation) but it cheaper to make (innovation) and more ppl buy it (population)= increase in share price.

504 2018-06-12 19:39:56 Higher damage just means more stocks. Damage has been pretty uniformly decreased across the board every smash game up until now, it's probably just a bit of a shock for s4 players to go back to damage values closer to melee or 64.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

535 2018-06-12 19:25:24 great trade man!  Do you mind if i ask what your position size would be on something like this?  Position size for me has been hard to master, always trying to decide how big or small I should go into different priced stocks.  On penny stocks like this I typically go smaller.Thx!
536 2018-06-12 19:24:33 I’m sure the crypto hype will come back, but for now, this is stocks and options season.  I’m a short term “bitcoin bear” without a doubt.
537 2018-06-12 19:21:21 I think it will be 4 stocks. You seem to die much earlier than in Smash 4 and the game is noticeably faster.
538 2018-06-12 19:20:09 Maybe it’s good it didn’t get “grabbed”. Those militias were counting on that. I see them on Twitter, I block them fast. It’s deep too...cattle, tobacco, Skoal, stocks. They scare the heck out of me. Young guys w all of those guns & ammo led by old asses who want it all.

One of the least discussed problems in S4 was the lack of interactions between players, making it difficult to properly figure each other out. 

More stocks is one way to solve that.

602 2018-06-12 18:49:50 What happens if investors no longer view stocks as risky?
Stock prices will rise because the equity-risk premium will decline. The rates of return will fall because prices will be higher and stocks will therefore become riskier because of their lower returns!

623 2018-06-12 18:41:54 There are already substantial luxury home property transfer taxes which generally factored into sale prices. But by all means, add another one, if that would help build more affordable housing. Not familiar with stock options but I assume stocks are more liquid than house.

713 2018-06-12 18:04:06 If you just focus on one stock and a daily chart and some pattern with a cool name you're missing the point. Stocks are linked to companies which are linked to peer competitors which are linked to the economy and a lot in between those last two points. Watch your macros.
714 2018-06-12 18:04:04 When #stocks fall. It falls with gravity
715 2018-06-12 18:03:55 Agreed.  The interesting thing about the math given the structure of the US economy after the past 25 yrs is that unless stocks outperf TLT by prob 700-1000bps per yr, every yr, the US will likely have to reimplement QE or choose b/t cutting Entitlemts, DoD, or Int Expense

724 2018-06-12 17:59:33 That's just math. Long-term bonds yielding 3% will very likely underperform stocks over the same maturity profile.

775 2018-06-12 17:43:42 With only these information the logical choice is A due to low PEG. But it can’t be used for investment decision. A high growth of 30 is not sustainable in long run.

794 2018-06-12 17:36:19 I bet its actually gotten worse. Low interest rates for 5+ years caused asset prices to rise, meaning more worth for people who owned stocks, real estate, etc. "The opportunity" was there, but most poor ppl don't invest like that or own those assets.

796 2018-06-12 17:34:36 Love your work, just disagree with this. Starting assumption is flawed, that stocks are higher purely because of QE and so reverse must mean bear market.

802 2018-06-12 17:32:34 Stocks yes. You can day trade as many times as you like. YOu have 4:1 bp from $500 to $2500 and 6:1 over $2500.
As for options, no margin, just can day trade as much as you want

804 2018-06-12 17:32:08 Now a days some stocks not moving according to strategy or parameters they are purely based on operators mind. Trap many people in mud way for SL.
805 2018-06-12 17:30:31 It looked like the default for stocks was 5 which is still okay depending on how fast they go
806 2018-06-12 17:29:57 Nassau County bans sparklers. But we can’t ban bump stocks or assault weapons. Riiiight. 
807 2018-06-12 17:29:29 To everyone liking this: Bump stocks have been banned since 1990. Do some research
808 2018-06-12 17:28:41 Oh shit I didn’t see where DACUS got confirmed back,  if they tweaked rage and made it overall be less of an effect/only activate as a true comeback mechanic when you’re losing in stocks as well I think it’ll be fine tho.
809 2018-06-12 17:28:24 What I really want to know is how many stocks the competitive scene will settle on.
810 2018-06-12 17:27:54 Nice. With margin and money from stocks/options just sold can be used to buy stocks immediately? Thanks

813 2018-06-12 17:26:43 Bump stocks have been banned in California since 1990....

Ok, so white people can break the law when every they want. But people fleeing domestic violence and gangs need to have their families ripped apart. Lovely.
814 2018-06-12 17:26:20 No thanks, I like owning a gun. I just think our country is wrong allowing these semi automatic weapons w bump stocks into the hands of civilians. Maybe you ppl belong w isis?
815 2018-06-12 17:25:14 Yes based on mechanics alone.  Directional air dodging out of her combos, also more stocks, also wavedashing, also a faster game where she probably moves slowly.
816 2018-06-12 17:24:51 It's not built throughout the economy. Most people don't own stocks.
817 2018-06-12 17:24:21 allllll my stocks are up 
818 2018-06-12 17:24:16 as the bullish mrkt participants always say, no worries as CB will step in to save the stock mrkt forever more. The last retreat 10 years to save them. This next one is likely to take much longer if CB can/will save them. So rise on Libor and stocks. Participants are 100% sure

829 2018-06-12 17:21:28 Their stocks have actually gone up since they did this. This is what they like to call “out-rage marketing”
830 2018-06-12 17:21:21 2 stocks for Smash 4 was stupid already.

832 2018-06-12 17:20:26 I'm guessing this Corn market isn't going to break any necks until Acreage and stocks are known in 2 weeks. 

up 9 after a down an almost 40c move is nothing.
833 2018-06-12 17:20:11 It’s a waiting game. I don’t have a lot of high volatility stocks so most of my stuff doesn’t fluctuate that much. I buy into things that have are going to have a long life like Disney. They aren’t going anywhere and with a possible merger they’re only going to go up in value.

837 2018-06-12 17:19:07 Agree with Bully here. Can you buy stocks on credit? Also like he mentioned the chargeback potential is huge and delinquencies/default is surely happening when BTC has lost 66% if it’s value from its ATH. Not good business for the banks to allow.
838 2018-06-12 17:18:21 i only invest in stocks because when i bring up stocks people don’t view me as a gambling degenerate as opposed to conventional gambling.
839 2018-06-12 17:17:47 @jimcramer big fan and wanted to thank you for your help and guidance. Got into stocks last year because of you and Ive doubled on 2 stocks (XPO,NEWR). Curious your thoughts on JYNT? Thanks again.
840 2018-06-12 17:17:08 Movement looks like it can be really quick, it looked like there was no lag after directional air dodge, it also looks like they recovering is harder and damage way higher to try and make stocks drop faster, it definitely has the potential to be a great competitive game
841 2018-06-12 17:16:34 Smash Ultimate is looking like a faster paced game, and that's a really good thing. More stocks in tournament means more chances for hype moments.
It also looks like you get knocked away faster when you're hit hard and suddenly stop, which is a neat pacing optimization.
842 2018-06-12 17:15:43 finally happy with what I have. I think I’m going to trade away one or two more stocks. But everything else is in there for the long run.

862 2018-06-12 17:09:32 Property is still way overvalued. Stocks have artificially high prices which are only kept afloat through artificially low interest rates and increased corporate debt to fund buy-backs.  Interest rates are due to rise, baby boomers dying. Cash is king as deflation happens first.

899 2018-06-12 16:58:50 So I guess you actually did kinda talk me into it.  You are in the gap between those on food stamps and those buying stocks. I just dont qualify being able to buy 5 shares of Exxon as someone really buying stocks. BTW I probably make close to what you do,I'm not rich by any means
900 2018-06-12 16:58:40 $CEI nice 20% pop
901 2018-06-12 16:58:37 Yup.  They should use the All-Brawl rules to start.

Everything on. Random first stage, chosen before character select. 2 (or 3 depending on pace) stocks. 3 out of 5 games. Loser can counterpick stage or character but not both.
902 2018-06-12 16:58:35 I want an aloe vera gel in a tub but stocks here in ph are way too expensive than the one selling in althea. I think I need to get ampules and some pieces of face mask so I can avail the free delivery charge.
903 2018-06-12 16:58:12 My stocks are looking beautiful today! 
904 2018-06-12 16:58:08 That's what they're going for, obviously, but it's very hard to say if that's truly where the competitive meta will lead us to. Hope so though, I don't want another Smash 4 where you have 2 stocks and they're both ultra fragile.
905 2018-06-12 16:58:05 Smash Switch will have to be 3 or 4 stocks it looks like
906 2018-06-12 16:58:00 you can see smoke coming out of the character and the splash art next to the stocks, so I'm pretty sure it's still there

908 2018-06-12 16:57:49 Directional air dodge is a huge positive. Fast stocks means there is no way 2 stocks is a thing, also good. Rage sucks but it super sucked in the 2 stock meta especially so who knows. I'm super happy right now and i can't contain myself.
909 2018-06-12 16:57:37 so this game prolly not 2 stocks

919 2018-06-12 16:54:59 i really like the fact it does a display of stocks after each ko
920 2018-06-12 16:54:52 Yeah, depends on the store.  Oftentimes the store will be very selective in what kind of cards in stocks to best fit their regular customer base.  My store is no exception to that either.
921 2018-06-12 16:54:49 STOCKS:  UEC is dn $0.03, CCJ is up $0.23, DNN is =, URA is dn $0.06, UUUU is dn $0.03, URG is =, NXE is dn $0.01.  Also, only DNN and NXE have hi volume numbers. DNN is at 700K while daily averg is 500k w 4:10 to go in trade. NXE is at 280K vs the daily 300K.  No concerns.
922 2018-06-12 16:54:48 that thing where the stocks count is displayed when someone is KO'd on 1v1 battles is noice
923 2018-06-12 16:54:41 Most of it started under Obama. I will leave it at that. BTW... in November, @GOP better hope Stocks are still up, since this guy wants to tie you to the performance of the market. Enjoy the volatility.
924 2018-06-12 16:54:31 Yea the down special for Ridley combos to a kill move holy cow.... that damage done is really goin to change stocks it looks like with good players will run matches fast
925 2018-06-12 16:54:22 I’m assuming Ultimate is going to be played with either 3 or 4 stocks
926 2018-06-12 16:54:20 The return of 4 stocks
927 2018-06-12 16:54:07 If this damage keeps up, you think 3 stocks are likely?
928 2018-06-12 16:54:06 I LOVE that stocks pop up in 1v1 like that.

Also, nice to hear Sakurai speak favorably about tournaments.
929 2018-06-12 16:53:53 Remaining stocks now briefly display prominently on the screen after each KO. I can see this creating a LOT of hype as players see how close they are to victory, both the audience and the competitors themselves. #NintendoE32018
930 2018-06-12 16:53:52 Damage seems high in Smash Ultimate, probably going to have more stocks in competitive

1157 2018-06-12 15:56:48 A moving average (MA) is a widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the “noise” from random price fluctuations. It is a trend-following, or lagging, indicator because it's based on past prices. #investing #stocks #buildwealth
1158 2018-06-12 15:56:47 You can't ignore the fact that the market enjoys leadership from multiple sectors/heavyweight stocks at the same time. Whether it's the big banking boys or the steady FMCG names or the bellwether IT names or the volatile Oil&Gas biggies. They all have chipped in.

1187 2018-06-12 15:47:21 Is it time to step in front of the TSLA train yet?  I try not to have axes to grind with stocks I'd rather short. and I needed long deltas.  TSLA has been my only long of consequence for the last few weeks and has paid off nicely.  But this price action is ridiculous.

1190 2018-06-12 15:45:32 nasdaq has drifted up 700 points in a month. rates going much higher will create a switch from growth to value stocks. Getting short nasdaq, and long value stocks.
1191 2018-06-12 15:45:27 Hardly thanks to the 'tax cuts for the rich'. Anything a working person got from the tax cut has been taken up by the increase in gas prices and inflation. Wages aren't up, the corporations took their fat winnings and have bought back stocks and given themselves fat raises.
1192 2018-06-12 15:45:10 Can growth stocks also be seen as value stocks? What’re the indicators?

1209 2018-06-12 15:34:45 This is usually the stage where the 'book traders' foolishly believe they can flip stocks for 10-20% gains & make a killing. It doesn't work that way. You've got to take outsized positions when there is opportunity, recognize it b4 others, & hold for the move

1580 2018-06-12 13:09:20 Close, but whatever. It says that bump stocks and raising age "may" curb "some" violence, but that effect is unknown. Bump stocks do not curb violence, and raising the age will only affect law abiding purchasers, but may affect HS age. And that funding is largely unnecessary.
1581 2018-06-12 13:09:15 I see my watchlist has too high peak on 5 minutes chart. So I can wait for some stocks hit bottom on 5 minutes chart

1635 2018-06-12 12:33:36 I have a question about Zakat on stocks and shares ISA held with the intention of long-term investment (10-20 years).  The investement simply tracks global shariah compliant companies.  Do you pay zakat on market value or 40% of market value like a defined contributions pension?
1636 2018-06-12 12:32:53 Not to mention that banning bump stocks is actually the job of Congress. Trump is not like Obama. He actually thinks Congress should do it’s job. That’s why it’s so easy for Trump to dismantle Obama’s legacy, because he bypassed Congress so much.

1682 2018-06-12 12:03:04 Agree @dontdelay  ... the cost (and risk) is usually oversold BUT for some, that risk becomes reality.

1709 2018-06-12 11:50:39 $USDJPY could easily jump back up through 111.00, but I don't see such a development as anything other than a compelling opportunity to sell into the rally. Ongoing risk for capitulation in stocks (policy normalization, share buybacks!) and US protectionism are key drivers here.

1711 2018-06-12 11:48:07 the trick is to keep all the electricity you generate for yourself rather than trying to sell it, and go completely off-grid. So: invest in battery tech stocks.

Slowly serious buying coming in.

Be watchful if buying interest sustains over a period 

The direction if confirmed upwards will be long and significant
1715 2018-06-12 11:42:21 If US economy is strong it should be non-inflationary growth 3-4% per yr but it is not. Real growth is zero or negative. Gasoline use decreasing; velocity of money on the low side ever; wages stagnant. FED raises rates to support idea of strength. Failure to raise, stocks tank.

1773 2018-06-12 10:58:30 Everyone here makes a good point yet avoiding these types of businesses does not guarantee a winner. In fact, you would argue many other stocks not reliant on the one supplier have delivered much inferior returns than these.

One of the worst performing ‘growth’ stocks during an incredible great bull run of the past 3.5 years.  And yet tsla bulls taunt the bears.  Just part of the delusion.

2098 2018-06-12 05:48:18 Oh, this is great then. Only a joint venture, not acquisition of stocks. 51% is pretty alarming since it will give CJ E&M control and influence over Pledis’ future decisions.
2099 2018-06-12 05:47:52 I'm pro gun bcuz I want to be able to defend my home. However, I don't need an automatic weapon. I also believe ppl should be able to hunt, but not with automatic weapons, especially w bump stocks. Anybody that thinks they need these for hunting, belong in target practice.
2100 2018-06-12 05:46:18 In addition, this will not be a short term thing unless CJ E&M sells their acquired stocks in the future. 
And oh, they can also change Pledis CEO’s with this 51% on hand

Acq is buying company stocks and that makes CJ&M partly owner of Pledis. & since its over 50% they hav control and significant influence over them

2141 2018-06-12 05:14:53 The fact that states have different gun laws is part of the problem. Just as an example, say that TN decides to ban the sale of bump stocks but they are legally for sale in another state, it would still be possible for bump stocks to be used in TN.

2156 2018-06-12 05:03:11 Infringing on innocent people is as useless as tits on a bull. Criminals find a way always. Bump stocks have been around for years but used (allegedly) only once. I’ve shot a bump stock and a full auto 249 in the army, his barrel would have melted 249 was used
2157 2018-06-12 05:02:53 Fake news who report Trumps tweets and show clips of him talking, should they stop spreading them? Don’t cave if wish, you’re tough, it will be hard for us, our economies are very much intertwined, but expect the US to be hit hard, stocks will tumble, dramatic unemployment.

- low cost of entry
- high liquidity

2369 2018-06-12 02:41:03 Not rocket science... Macro-prudential controls have reduced the amount of money chasing housing stocks by impacting the cashflow of investors... Less $ chasing the same stock means lower prices, giving first home buyers a chance to enter the market.
2370 2018-06-12 02:40:53 Bump stocks are currently under ATF comment period as per order of the DOJ. You can't just do away with them, there is a process. As far as raising age to 21, good luck.

2419 2018-06-12 02:16:20 How will banning bump stocks stop bump firing? And if you can’t be trusted with a gun until 21 then you most definitely can’t be trusted to vote until that same age.
2420 2018-06-12 02:15:03 90k up? must be dropping big time money in stocks haha, congrats!
2421 2018-06-12 02:14:31 You may have to check your facts.  My stocks and 401k never looked like it does now.  The jump it has made in the last 2 years I could retire sooner rather than later.
2422 2018-06-12 02:14:22 Idiot, what do you base your non fact on??!! Nothing tangible obviously. How are your stocks doing?? Mine have been fabulous over the past 15 mths. Went from upper middle class to next level. Perhaps rethink investments?
2423 2018-06-12 02:11:59 You are an idiot who showed up late for the gender equality discussion at the G7. We all know where you want to grab women. 
Your economy is fake. Stocks have little effect on low/middle income Americans, especially the latter who pay a larger percentage in taxes than you.
2424 2018-06-12 02:11:11 Anyone who lives anywhere that might ban bump stocks, DM me. I want you to remain a law-abiding citizen by giving your pending illegal weaponry a good home. #2AShallNotBeInfringed

2433 2018-06-12 02:00:21 Yes, but what do I know. Just looks like the S&P, Silver, EUR, Wheat, Cotton, multiple assets, vulnerable to a smackdown here. 25bp, possibly 50bp, but I give the latter low odds, just a risk. If wrong, all good for PMs, commodities, stocks. If right, even better, cheaper to buy!
2434 2018-06-12 01:59:56 Asian stocks moving higher. #TheBachelerotte 

err, I mean #NorthKoreanSummit
2435 2018-06-12 01:58:41 Same here...screenshot for posterity.
2436 2018-06-12 01:58:31 With all due respect to warren, stocks are speculation as well... the fact you have little faith in one vs the other isn’t the difference between the two.
2437 2018-06-12 01:57:50 All I can say is that the S&P is primed for a pullback here, as are other assets like Silver and the EUR. I believe they could be surprisingly hawkish on Wed. If I'm wrong, great, if right, even better, just creates a cheaper buying opp for PMs, commodities, and stocks imho.
2438 2018-06-12 01:57:24 Totally agree with Real Estate with the caveat from your (@Mochievous) earlier tweet on Stocks.

Not all Real Estate Investments appreciate over time. A robust portfolio helps to cushion the 'bumps' but 'eternal vigilance' is key.
2439 2018-06-12 01:57:12 Which America? The one in perpetual war so you and your buddies in the MIC can profit while American workers get the shaft? Or the one where you undermine America for the sake of the Establishment?

2445 2018-06-12 01:53:51 That is possible under a hyper-inflationary crack-up boom.  "Priced in USD".  Real market values will still be falling like a stone.  You'll have to divide it by $CRB, Gold, foreign stocks, etc.  Something not denominated in USD and definately not a crypto.

2452 2018-06-12 01:50:28 The value of stocks is meaningless on a balance sheet.  Stocks are recorded by the purchase price.  No other value exists until the stock is sold.
2453 2018-06-12 01:50:12 I was a huge skeptic last July and I started reading the fundamentals about what gives bitcoin its value.  I became a convert a month later.   I am convinced.  (Other cryptos are worth a lot less and many will be zero like penny stocks).

2456 2018-06-12 01:49:25 I got blocked by our (ouch) president for correcting grammar. So much for the oath he took. I’ve been laid off twice in one year. Trump’s healthcare plan? $750 month lowest quote for $500 month income. Stocks up 40%? My portfolio isn’t. Thanks to Obama can you claim any of these.
2457 2018-06-12 01:47:46 But we know the value of stocks, because they're available in real time on the Internet so this is not an issue when it comes to the stock market.

2482 2018-06-12 01:27:51 While I don't like what Klaus did on $AVZ talk is he is only interested in finding assets for his junior stocks and then making discoveries. After that he isn't as interested. Could be why $BLZ and $LCD are getting some money and attention.

2488 2018-06-12 01:25:21 I live in Canada and only use my TFSA to trade with through my bank not a broker so I dont have the oppurtunity to short stocks. Would these program still be viable for day/ swing trades ?
2489 2018-06-12 01:24:34 I was thinking along a similiar track. The stock market doesn't track my net worth. Stocks rose dramatically over the last 5 or 6 years. My net worth did not rise at the same rate.  I have more assets in real property. And the market does not track my debt either.
2490 2018-06-12 01:23:53 $BLZ starting to show signs of life. Could Klaus be turning his attention and money to finding acquisitions and discoveries on his other junior mining stocks in his stable. Either that or Tolga and Cranston are close to finding an asset!

2503 2018-06-12 01:06:39 “Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 ...”

Silly little turnip. That’s not @potus’s job, that’s a Congress job. They make laws.

”Are you afraid of the @NRA?”

Nope, but a great bunch of patriots. No need for ‘fear.’
2504 2018-06-12 01:06:17 Yes they were smile.... Well done, Pres Trump, Kim... There less risk for our stocks...
2505 2018-06-12 01:05:29 October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.

2507 2018-06-12 01:05:05 Stocks are down for 2018. Slower job creation in 2017 and 2018 than the previous few years. Looks like the Obama economy is starting to fade and the Trump economy is beginning to take effect.
2508 2018-06-12 01:03:48 I'm not a dude. The stock market doesn't impact me because I own no stocks. But it did affect me back in 2002 when it bottomed out and I lost a ton of money.
2509 2018-06-12 01:02:34 You know, it occurs to me that with all the pissing and moaning over what people say, people that say things like this should be publicly shamed and maybe either spend a while in the stocks, or wearing a scold's bridle.
2510 2018-06-12 01:02:15 Keeps Pot stocks low, now is the time to buy
2511 2018-06-12 01:01:57 While I’m sure that’s significant for you as an individual, it’s crumbs compared to the billions that the rich get to keep & buy their own stocks back with. It hasn’t led to more jobs or better wages like we were told it would.
2512 2018-06-12 01:01:51 It is called wages. And the idiots who work for wages and  voted for tRump wall street are taking 1 trillion and buying stocks back. That is massive amount of future inflation that will eat your wage increase up. Bend over boys it's coming.

2517 2018-06-12 00:58:02 Why not just ban firearms altogether? Banning a bump-stock and raising the age of purchase won't do shit!

It will just result in more bump-stocks being illegally bought and more illegal firearm sales for the minors.

Be like the UK. We don't shoot eachother.

2547 2018-06-12 00:32:07 @jimcramer @CramerClub would you be able to cover prospective gambling stocks that might benefit from the upcoming expansion of sports betting across the US on the upcoming members only call?
2548 2018-06-12 00:31:41 How does that compare to separating children from their mother? Or systemic racism ? Or taking away healthcare? Or dictating women health issues? Or bump stocks? Or 5,000 lies a year?
2549 2018-06-12 00:31:33 Might have to when stocks correct downward 70%!
2550 2018-06-12 00:30:56 You are conflating the NYSE and the DJIA. The S&P500 is probably a better estimate of market value than DJIA. Some stocks do better than the index and other do worse. 

Rates of return for most small investors have dropped precipitously this year.

2552 2018-06-12 00:29:02 Hyperbole. I mean I go into a major brokerage every morning 8am and only see the retailers losing money. The smart money is writing calls and making money off the market going down. Etfs are holding up but they tend to be in defensive stocks like utilities or finance.

2557 2018-06-12 00:24:14 It finally broke through and stayed above trendline resistance that's held since 5/22.
2558 2018-06-12 00:23:40 are stocks over priced? well yeah but, did we or did we not just print another trillion dollars out on the streets, well uh yeah. plus, if trump whimps out on the tariffs, why that's disappointing. and if they fully deploy, yeah that's ugly. 

....BUY!!!

2559 2018-06-12 00:22:57 They own half of the stock in the market. They don't. 

I didn't say how many foreign entities owned stock or bonds in NYSE traded companies. But they own a large percent of those stocks and bonds. You can look it up. You will find it widely reported and indexed various ways.

2562 2018-06-12 00:18:31 Not at all. Maybe the stock markets are but most of us have little to no stocks.

2566 2018-06-12 00:15:54 @narendramodi DEAR SIR,

WAIVING OF FARMERS LOAN IS IMPOSSIBLE , IT EFFECTS MONEY,

PURCHASE THE PRODUCES OF FARMERS WHO HAVE TAKEN LOAN AT MSP 

THAT IS 1.5 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE COST PRICE. BEFORE IMPLEMENTING 

TAKE OUT THE STOCKS IN ALL WAREHOUSES AND PRIVATE WARE HOUSES
2567 2018-06-12 00:13:45 The Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.
2568 2018-06-12 00:13:13 Stocks and bonds 
2569 2018-06-12 00:12:07 In fact you just got done pointing out that ~50% of Americans own stocks, and now you want to argue they don't. Can your students see this?

2571 2018-06-12 00:11:52 Bobby Axelrod was a struggling trader until 9-11. He saw an opportunity and took a morally wrong decision to short tourism and aviation stocks before the markets went on lock down. On market open, he was a billionaire.
2572 2018-06-12 00:11:47 I eat good on vacay. Just cause my family stocks the house with food where as I never have food in my house..

Same group involved in both stocks that did fake PRs/fake websites/fake twitter accounts for ZNTR, TNKE, TRSI, BKEN, AMPG, and NHPI
2574 2018-06-12 00:11:09 Ban bump stocks
2575 2018-06-12 00:10:00 You idiot- you act like this is a big reality show. I can’t stand you. You are a liar, playing the press and the public. How about those kids that you met and promised that you would do something to ban gun sales without thorough backround checks and would ban bump stocks. Liar.
2576 2018-06-12 00:09:16 I think I need too read up a little more on investing in stocks I earned i a few dollars but i think I’m still missing a few key  concepts
2577 2018-06-12 00:07:27 @RayDalio has talked about a final surge in the bull market before it ends. Perhaps value investors flooding into growth stocks will be the driving force behind it? The market being at all time highs makes it very difficult to find value at the moment.
2578 2018-06-12 00:06:40 The thing that I've realized about holding stocks is that it's not so risky going 100% cash. There will ALWAYS be bargains in the stock market. It's up to the individual to figure out where they exist.  #money #stocks #investing
2579 2018-06-12 00:04:33 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2580 2018-06-12 00:04:07 I should get back into stocks 
2581 2018-06-12 00:03:43 Yeah I never know what to do with these stocks under 1$, with a long term mind set it’s hard for me to not sell when I see it double. But am nervous I’m going to miss it his 2, 3, 4$ a share. Thoughts ?
2582 2018-06-12 00:02:53 A ban on bump stocks
2583 2018-06-12 00:02:39 That’s terrific news about the stock market...as of 2016 though the top 10% of American households owned 84% of all stocks. I’m real happy for them though. Nice going, asshole.
2584 2018-06-12 00:02:15 1) Yet again, Say it with me now... the stock market is not the economy.
2) Although the price of stocks is a reflection of value, it's not US value.
3) Don't you have a meeting you should be getting ready for?
2585 2018-06-12 00:01:21 They are hard as’f tho but 520 pushing it  I looked it up the most I seen them for was 460 on stocks
