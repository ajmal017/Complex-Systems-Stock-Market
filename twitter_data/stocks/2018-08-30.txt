Oh! And buy the way! 401k's have only a small part in the stock market!! Remember? 80% of all stocks are owned by the richest 20% of Americans??!!
51 2018-08-30 23:33:57 What about the HALF of Americans who don't own ANY stocks?

57 2018-08-30 23:29:09 Gave up on stocks, but investing in EA sounds like a good idea. buy whenever a game is announced, sell about a week after a game releases. Seems like most of their games cause them to tank when theyre announced, but people still buy them anyways

68 2018-08-30 23:17:42 The truth is, it's like dipping into his own pockets. He can give to the rich and taketh from the poor, so it is written by the passing tax cuts and probably even manipulating stocks to favor the rich!

73 2018-08-30 23:10:57 Jeff Bezos makes his money off stocks, not Amazon's income. Amazon pays him $80,000/year, that's all he gets from the company directly.

He makes more on stocks than his company makes on sales. It would be literally impossible for that money to be taking away from employees.
74 2018-08-30 23:09:36 Only for the very rich and the big corporations that are spending their tax money on buying more stocks. Most tax payers will be lucky to have a extra $500 this year.

93 2018-08-30 22:56:48 I wonder if there’s some sort of psychological hoop-jumping they have to do in order to justify shorting stocks. I’ve always pictured them snorting a huge line of coke, ripping off their shirt, then roaring as they slam the “submit” button on their decision.

96 2018-08-30 22:55:21 I was in habit of not taking stocks through earnings. With exceptions HD being one. May go back to that. Very few will run away from you. If they do I play something else til they pull back to where I like.  But hell I zig it zags.

108 2018-08-30 22:47:47 Universal background checks.  Gun show loophole closed.  Ban military assault weapons that no law abiding citizen needs.  Bump stocks.  High round cartridges.  I.e., everything your wonderful NRA opposes.

125 2018-08-30 22:33:03 This also shows why we need to teach kids that they should be buying stocks as young as possible and not wasting their money on garbage stuff. Jobs do not make people wealthy.

141 2018-08-30 22:22:20 Truth lies in the saying “You have to have money to make money”. A modest % of people have xtra $ to invest in stocks & a FIn Advisor, as learning curve is too high for most. High % Savings accounts were a lot easier but Fed lowered % too low for too long for corporations.

145 2018-08-30 22:20:09 Also a question I get a TON: WHAT IS FOREIGN EXCHANGE?!? Great question. Haha I invest my money into another currencies market. If I see a currency pair that’s going to go up or down I invest in it and make the profits! It’s a fast paced market unlike stocks! 
146 2018-08-30 22:19:26 Me personally i would probably drop the price a little before hand just to ensure it sells early... u playing with fire holding it that close to expiration unless u have the margin to buy the stocks

148 2018-08-30 22:18:26 People are DMing me about when I do stocks and when I trade. I usually trade foreign exchange tues-thurs 11Pm-3am (London is my fav market to trade in) and I invest in stocks when I want to make money but don’t want to constantly be watching my charts ! hope that helps!

202 2018-08-30 21:44:13 It’s outrageous that this cut will supposedly save 25B on the backs of working people while the tax cuts implemented by congress (including @dandonovan_ny) are giving nearly 190B per year back to the 1% and corporations that are predominantly just buying their stocks back.

344 2018-08-30 20:31:49 while middle-class tax cuts are set to expire in 2026. Following the tax cuts, corporate CEOs have been pulling in major paychecks thanks to their companies buying back their own stocks.

371 2018-08-30 20:20:59 Stocks are not debt, they represent your partial ownership, so as long as the company dose not stop operating you still have a stock in that company. if they liquidate, the assets are sold to cover debt and if anything is left the money goes to shareholders. I could be wrong!

379 2018-08-30 20:17:16 World stocks fall: US -.4%; Europe -.3%. Hints of new China tariffs along with a natural consolidation from the recent rally catalyzed market decline.  NAFTA replacement success + China accommodation partially priced into market. Failure of either will stoke downside volatility.

381 2018-08-30 20:16:07 Yes, why not? Because, as has been noted repeatedly, foreign purchases of USTs are trending ever further down, with foreign CBs having been net sellers for several years. If US stocks fall, foreign UST bond-buyers *may* return, but then the US will be in an acute budget crisis.

426 2018-08-30 20:00:27 Are you sure you don't work for CNBC? Trafing contrary seems a good plan following you. US stocks are in a huge bubble, while Bitcoin is bottoming out and has extremely low downward potential. My strong advice is get all your money out of stocks and buy #BTC!

433 2018-08-30 19:57:09 But there is a complication: the US budget is utterly dependent on perpetually rising US stock markets and foreign UST buyers; in the absence of foreign UST buyers, domestic "suckers" must buy; domestic suckers won't rotate to bonds unless stocks fall ... see the problem?

441 2018-08-30 19:52:38 This isn't completely accurate. What Amazon is failing to make clear here is that yes they do give stocks as bonuses to their emoyees but when the employees leave they forfeit their stocks which means that they forfeit whatever bonuses they received.

477 2018-08-30 19:37:12 Agreed. The "trilemma" is simply that all three (stocks, USD, bond prices) can't all go up together given the present set of dynamics. At least one of the three must go down (and probably two of three).

Fama/French indexes (7/1926 to 6/2018):

Small Cap Value = +14.8%
Large Cap Value = +12.0%

US Market = +10.1%

Large Cap Growth = +9.8%
Small Cap Growth = +8.8%
592 2018-08-30 18:58:33 Right. That’s why every policy has met with success.

790 2018-08-30 17:50:22 $TRPX Said my farewell earlier and took a short position. Bye bye cannabis stocks.
791 2018-08-30 17:50:16 I own plenty of stocks and still think Trump fucking sucks. His only contribution is saying crazy shit and having the market briefly freak out.
792 2018-08-30 17:50:13 The. Fishing incident yesterday highlights Britain's need to leave the EU's Common Fisheries Policy which has forced U.K. Boats outside British waters because foreign vessels have plundered 60% of our fish stocks. 
So let us "amicably" take back control of our waters!
Mrs May!
793 2018-08-30 17:50:12 Does length of bull/bear markets (within cycle) have anything to do with the category of investment? $BTC bull runs tend to last about 2 years, stocks like $AMZN, as we can see,12 years, UK real estate bull market lasted 45 years. Crypto seems to have the shortest market cycles.

796 2018-08-30 17:49:44 We don't need stocks to be grateful for the improvement in the US economy.
There's more money in our pockets and more hope in our hearts.

"And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others."
797 2018-08-30 17:48:35 Give one billionaire a million dollars he will put it into stocks or mutual funds. Give 10,000 people who make $40k a year a hundred dollars they will spend it on shoes,  new clothes, going out to dinner etc... that’s what propels an economy. Especially today’s service economy

810 2018-08-30 17:44:07 30 Indian stocks vs 500 US stocks doesn't seem a good enough comparision.
811 2018-08-30 17:43:50 given that there are 5 stocks in the banknifty which covers 80% of weightage, a movement like this would involve dynamic managing those 5 stocks
812 2018-08-30 17:43:48 apple stocks rise by 30%.
813 2018-08-30 17:43:18 You can't lose money on stocks.
814 2018-08-30 17:42:34 While I agree this is a sea-change in how the SEC thinks/operates, the cynic in me sees this as 'perfect timing' for the big guys to dump their stocks on the little guys as global economies teeter on the edge of a massive recession. The Wall Street equivalent of an ICO exit scam.

818 2018-08-30 17:41:59 complete horseshit. half a million people aren't going to get internet famous. they need good paying jobs. and your own personal experience of making money through stocks doesn't mean shit when you're living paycheck to paycheck and living in debt.
819 2018-08-30 17:41:19 Think about this: 90% of the news reported in the U.S. is negative about Trump. Which means we have no "news". Low unemployment, high stocks, high consumer confidence, a strong military, tax cuts for families - & yet NO positive news?  Nothing but Bias & Lies on the Left daily.
820 2018-08-30 17:39:48 #RahulConspiracyTheory  Amazon growth is by online buying by people which is accounted money. Easy to buy even if it is 1000 km away & find out stocks. So it will grow. Obviously no black money to Amazon. All accounted. Good news if online buying grows.
821 2018-08-30 17:39:41 Generally, they are too large to be able to daytrade in stock. They have to look ahead 6-9-12 months to see if they are comfortable taking a position now that may take weeks or longer to build. Then they also need weeks or longer to exit a position. #stocks

843 2018-08-30 17:26:45 In Hockey, “Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.” (Wayne Gretzky). When investing, buy what is inexpensive (going higher) and sell what is too expensive.
In 2018 buy Silver (and Gold) and sell the DOW and the high-flying tech stocks of the NASDAQ.

860 2018-08-30 17:21:21 easiest way to implement a screen over such a large universe of funds, and that digging into each fund's process wasn't realistic.

865 2018-08-30 17:19:49 Can't understand Buffett's thinking right now.  He is ignoring the "buy when valuations are low" strategies (price to book, price to sales, etc.) he learned from Benjamin Graham - and instead is advocating buying at some of the highest valuations ever for stocks.  Wow.

1059 2018-08-30 16:00:50 - @StrategasRP ups its forecast for 2018 corporate repatriation to $700B - $850B. "The sheer magnitude of these repatriations remains underappreciated by investors .. It’s no wonder that GDP estimates are being revised higher and stocks are hitting all-time highs .."

-WarrenBuffet99
1073 2018-08-30 15:54:35 The jump in markets is due to you cutting corporate taxes, subsequent buy-backs of stocks, and running up 1.5 trillion on the USA credit card to pay for the tax cuts. The GOP has proposed slashing Medicare and SS to pay for it.  None of this is good for the working classes.
1074 2018-08-30 15:54:27 The fun part is having the stocks. I honestly have thought about getting a second copy or printing my own cards so that I could go to like 6 sticks each which would increase the necessity to bid more.

1079 2018-08-30 15:53:23 And Obama folks didn't?  For the last 8 years Obama fans blamed Bush for the stock downturn and lauded Obama for the stock upturn.  Stocks have increased since day 1 of Trump's administration and now we have to listen to how the president has little to do with it.  Hogwash.

1096 2018-08-30 15:45:58 By the way, how many times in the last 100 years have stocks given up 75% of their value? It HAS happened. But only twice. Dow Industrials fell nearly 90% from their peak in 1929 to their lows in 1932. In March 2000, the NASDAQ peaked and fell 78% to lows in Oct 2002.
1097 2018-08-30 15:45:20 This makes actual sense. If the news of Sevilla loan move is true then that tells how his stocks are fairing. I am not sure but I guess even Bayern refuted any move for him.

1102 2018-08-30 15:43:29 I agree that MOC shouldn't be trading stocks while writing laws that will likely impact those stocks, but I fear that will be the poison pill that will compel MOC to vote it down. Reduce the bill to simply require any candidate to provide tax returns and it might pass.
1103 2018-08-30 15:43:19 Correct.  He fails to mention that 10% of the American population owns 85% of the value of all stocks.  The goal should be to broaden ownership across more income classes.

Stocks in 2010 were exactly were those were in 1998. In 1981 where those were in 1968. So his core theory that stocks ALWAYS outperform bonds is comical.
He made his money on insurance float, and the indebting of America, cheap money.

1127 2018-08-30 15:34:16 Buffett's "buy stocks" pitch carried a caveat -- better than bonds when compared in 30 year timeframe. That's as bearish as he can be publicly.

1139 2018-08-30 15:30:50 Your point is that people who trade Bitcoin don’t care about stocks. But that is ignorance, inexperience. They should care.

1195 2018-08-30 15:15:35 Why? The economy is the best in over 50 years, lowest unemoyment, 4.2 GDP, more jobs then people looking, record breaking stocks, all BECAUSE of Trump. You don't have to like him to appreciate the good he is doing for the country.
1196 2018-08-30 15:15:31 Tibay ni ate girl hahahaha. Taena wala na ngang stocks na maayos eh
1197 2018-08-30 15:15:14 i agree about 100% of the stocks being overhyped but it's a bulls market.... join the insanity
1198 2018-08-30 15:14:40 Historically there probably has been a bias against stocks that were trading around $10 or lower but I doubt that is a significant factor in this split.  I like the fact that the option strikes will be closer together percentage-wise post split.

1208 2018-08-30 15:12:33 You said in the FSN interview you went long equities after the fall in February but in every interview in 2018 you stated the complete opposite. You said repeatedly you are totally out of stocks and expect a huge decline in 2018.

1211 2018-08-30 15:11:38 Businesses bought back a lot of their own stock from the massive tax cuts.  That's why not many ppl received a good wage increase. Others who hold stock are hedge funds, investment funds, and uber wealthy ppl. The amount of individually held stocks by average ppl is not much.
1212 2018-08-30 15:11:14 Watching A Knight's Tale, scene when Heath L is in the stocks & everyone is throwing stuff, but love how no one seems to notice the three guys standing right at the front of the crowd in suspiciously immaculate cloaks until they actually shrug them off.

1218 2018-08-30 15:08:38 What happens to these type of stories, is day traders that have run it up, will move to other stories or stocks in its sector, and it just bleeds lower in multiple days, lets see.  $CRON

Anyone looking for a great read, check out the University of Berkshire Hathaway. It details Buffet and Munger's market commentary at the annual meeting for 20+ years
1260 2018-08-30 14:57:04 You do realize that only 52% of American's own stocks at all? The rest are going backwards as inflation is exceeding wage growth since most of your tax cuts went to stock buybacks and other non-wage purposes.

1273 2018-08-30 14:54:41 Just my view here, but I think you should be charged twice in such cases. Once for the assault and again for being that drunk

1278 2018-08-30 14:53:42 Er, I did bother to read the article. Did you read my Tweet? The actions to which the then (and current) owners pleaded guilty in Dec 2016 indicate an approach to scallop fishing that hardly respects stocks. Their provocation of French fishermen is unlikely to be unplanned.

1315 2018-08-30 14:42:06 Chewing thru @CitronResearch $CRON note and we don't see anything toxic.  Is valuation rich?  IDK.  It ran 125% in 2 weeks so there's that.  But NASDAQ-listed #cannabis stocks carry a premium in a FOMO world and new shorts just piled in.

1453 2018-08-30 14:09:52 Ignore the stocks for 2 seconds (coming from someone studying math + Econ at university) - best multiplayer game at both shows, allowing time to implement beta feedback - this game is suddenly looking to be their best release by a long shot in quite some time.
1454 2018-08-30 14:09:19 The gains in FMCG, pharma and metal stocks were offset by weakness in banks, auto and financial stocks. Sensex and Nifty ended 0.09% and 0.13% lower respectively.

Take a deep breath, if I have cash, I look for a bottom, and look for hard hit growth stocks selling at low P/E bargain prices. 10-15% corrections are healthy.
1457 2018-08-30 14:07:53 The answer is simple: go buy some stocks and stop complaining
1458 2018-08-30 14:07:52 Over 2 million people in Missouri have pre existing medical issues. Our AG Josh Hawley is helping you sue to take the pre existing clause out of ACA.

1467 2018-08-30 14:03:48 I'm sorry you didn't have a very good experience.  My experience has been slightly different from that.  As a FT associate, I receive a competitive wage, monthly bonus, full benefits package, stocks and both PTO/UPT options.
1468 2018-08-30 14:03:28 No! My IRA did not make lots of money. Broker told me it was because the market has been flat for 2 years. Another lier.

1471 2018-08-30 14:02:45 Sir indexes seem to be 'ahead of their time'. I recall 40k being discussed for 2019-end and Sensex is almost there with one full quarter to go in 2018. Several small & midcap value stocks have not recovered fully. Perhaps a major correction is due again?
1472 2018-08-30 14:02:45 84% of stocks is owned by elites and shit is artificially inflated. Raise corporation taxes.
1473 2018-08-30 14:02:42 no omg its his oldest son who's the founder/ceo of ymc and i think he just holds some stocks I SWEAR I READ THIS SOMEWHERE HOLD ON
1474 2018-08-30 14:02:38 listen to Trump, buy some stocks and stop complaining...
1475 2018-08-30 14:02:36 I could comment on other points, but it likely wouldn't resonate w/you or others. 

Trump's economy is fine. It's not "the best ever". That is my main point. W/respect to "record stock market"-stocks go up over time ... records are achieved and then are broken later. No big deal
1476 2018-08-30 14:02:05 "The Richest 10% of Americans Now Own 84% of All Stocks"~Money
Middle class me did not see any wild $ thrown my way. Wages r stagnant,medical costs are going up,houses aren't selling as high as they should,student loan repayment is a struggle, etc...impact on avg. Americans.
1477 2018-08-30 14:02:04 To answer my own question...  Investment refers to investment in machinery, no general investment like stocks or bonds.
1478 2018-08-30 14:01:52 Yeah @SixFlags CEO vowed to bring some kind of new attraction to every park in the chain year after year. Usually 3 new coasters a year, and amazing flat rides which the chain needs after the lack there of in the late 90s early 00s and who's stocks are up? Six Flags!
1479 2018-08-30 14:01:35 So because you don’t own stocks, it’s a bad thing that corporations are making money? What about the millions of Americans that are employed but these companies and if they lost money could potentially lose their jobs?
1480 2018-08-30 14:01:32 enough is relative; just buy some stocks and stock complaining
1481 2018-08-30 14:01:00 @MadMoneyOnCNBC why does it seem as though just before earning season all of my stocks take a plunge, but a week or two later they're back up if not higher than before?  Is this normal or am I seeing an illusionary pattern
1482 2018-08-30 14:00:06 Value doesn’t always > growth (nor do stocks always > bonds), it can be a challenge to stay the course during inevitable periods of underperformance (for both)

Some investors decide they don’t have to stomach & opt for total market indexes (or bond-heavy portfolios) instead

1500 2018-08-30 13:52:37 Workers have 401Ks and pension plans that own company stock and they benefit from that fact when the stock go up.  They also have the ability to directly buy stocks versus sit back and complain that people who own stocks make all of the money.

1502 2018-08-30 13:51:40 For one, stocks are very healthy, brother. So, anyone could have benefited from this surge whether they had $5 in stocks or $500 million. Let your money work for you

1504 2018-08-30 13:51:14 I’ve been thinking about moving some of my capital to stocks, but every time I sit down and really consider it I see crypto having such a better upside, and end up buying more btc lol.
1505 2018-08-30 13:51:00 Can we use BO for existing stocks or is it's strict to intraday?
1506 2018-08-30 13:50:51 Blame the media, they should be telling people to buy stocks instead of bitching about Trump. Everyone is allowed to buy stocks...stop complaining and invest in America

1521 2018-08-30 13:47:49 That is exactly why the stock market went up under Obama. The companies sold low interest bonds in a low interest environment and bought their stocks back. Its been happening since 2009. NOW the market is rising due to increased  revenues from a healthy economy.
1522 2018-08-30 13:47:29 @realDonaldTrump The top 10% wealthiest American households own 84% of all stocks in the market.

And 

Only 32% of the entire American workforce has money in a 401K

That is all

1526 2018-08-30 13:46:09 True. according to statistics, only about 54 million Americans have 401k's, So I don't know if I would even say "many", more like "some". Also, 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10%, so Trumps tweet was truly aimed at a small percentage of Americans.

1535 2018-08-30 13:44:27 Basically, trading securities with a company when you have inside information of them. So if I have stocks from a company, and the CFO tells me to sell because they’re going under (which I’m not allowed to know), that’s insider trading.

1543 2018-08-30 13:43:02 Effectively, crypto gains will be classified just as another capital gains - like stocks, dividends, or interest. I consider it fair.
1544 2018-08-30 13:42:55 Most Americans do not own stocks. Wages remain flat. Only the rich are getting richer. But you only care about yourself and your rich friends. You are a failure.
1545 2018-08-30 13:42:18 That's a great story! Im a professional musician in the MD,DC,VA Area.

1549 2018-08-30 13:40:28 Limousine liberals go their whole lives as capitalists. They own stocks, private equity, land, etc. But when it comes time to run for office (or start a so-called revolution), they suddenly become socialists to dupe the disenfranchised, instead of showing them how they made it.

1568 2018-08-30 13:35:57 Seems to be a lot of confusion. Stocks are in a strong uptrend. No evidence that is ending. Bitcoin is in a strong downtrend. No evidence that is ending. Proceed accordingly. Don’t guess the top of an uptrend or bottom of a downtrend without strong evidence.

1581 2018-08-30 13:31:45 1/ This long-running bull market may tempt one to think stocks are superior to bonds.  In reality, they offer a level of expected return that's consistent with their level of risk, as does bonds.

1669 2018-08-30 12:56:08 To bad You sold all of Your individual stocks last year,  before the surge began.

1671 2018-08-30 12:55:40 @AnalysisSense Is there a way we can get the possible gap up opening stocks during pre market session?
1672 2018-08-30 12:55:04 The great majority of the American do not have 401Ks and certainly can't afford to invest in stocks. The unemployment rate is down because people are working 2 or more jobs to make ends meet and barely getting by. You've created an economy for the rich... GFY!!!
1673 2018-08-30 12:54:38 I trade stocks daily, using a variety of trading strategies! Key thing is knowing when to get in and buy, and when to get out and sell.  If you stay in a trade and hold on to shares too long, you can easily lose out!
1674 2018-08-30 12:54:30 On the radio they were talking about how mykey k got  arrested for illegal trades in the stocks and then said "he can trade their insides" and that theyd "pay his bail", if that aint me
1675 2018-08-30 12:54:09 For all of you who can’t afford stocks or don’t have a 401k.... eh, good luck.

1677 2018-08-30 12:53:32 want to see a drop in indices & especially fang stocks to test there resolve ... one day buying the dip won't work but for now they have all forgotten about business cycles they act as if markets never go down
1678 2018-08-30 12:53:17 For those of you that do not have enough money to invest in stocks...... SUCKERS! ...... I'm going to do nothing for you
1679 2018-08-30 12:52:46 Yeah I'm not about to buy in to stocks rn. I'm just saying he's not trying to unload. Him plugging stocks isn't gonna have a significant effect. I'm bullish bitcoin, and bearish stocks. But also, you have to look at Tyler's definition of medium and long term.

1681 2018-08-30 12:52:21 What about the 50% of Americans who don't own stock and haven't had a raise in 30 years thanks to Republican Voodoo Economics. 

Or the fact that the top 10% who do own stock own 80% of ALL stocks?

That means that only the richest 5% of Americans got richer.

1687 2018-08-30 12:50:26 “The top 10% of American households, as defined by total wealth, now own 84% of all stocks in 2016”
I’m still trying to figure out how could so many Americans be stupid enough to think a supposed billionaire could even attempt to have their best interest in mind.
1688 2018-08-30 12:49:25 But you see, that is the problem. The average Joe down the street does not have money in stocks and bonds. His money went to the local grocery store to feed his family. Your policies are not helping him.
1689 2018-08-30 12:48:44 This is very easy to get wrong, because our brain loves to remember stuff as our own so you can just remember things totally wrong.
That said, I see almost no robs put gyro in hand between stocks instead of charging, and throwing gyro on sheild and punishing a release with dsmash
1690 2018-08-30 12:48:34 You got some gyros, went to the farmer's market, talked opioids but not gun violence, and bought some more pharmaceutical stocks in one of your campaign donor's private companies. That about right?

1737 2018-08-30 12:33:51 what about stagnant wages?  what about people who don't have a 401K? What about people who don't have the means to invest in stocks?  You are doing nothing for the working poor who are living paycheck to paycheck

Stocks Are Overvalued!

THE REALITY: 
this comment only applies to a relatively small subset of stocks — 500 of 12,000+ publicly traded equities & is based on Shiller CAPE, which has been unreliable in post-1989, out-of-sample tests

Lesson: look beyond headlines.
1767 2018-08-30 12:19:53 Ok. And how does money being in stocks, instead of under your mattress, prove harmful to the economy?

1781 2018-08-30 12:12:57 You know that almost all retirement plans today are investment plans, where the money you and your company put in are invested in stocks and bonds. Also, raising minimum wage doesnt do anything, because then the fed raises interest rates, which causes cost to soar.

1801 2018-08-30 12:06:17 Good news is that we are seeing % of stocks making new highs and % trading above their 200-day averages moving higher (but still shy of January). Bad news is we are seeing % of investors who are bullish moving higher. Optimism getting excessive.
1802 2018-08-30 12:05:38 I was doing well under Obama. You understand most of your red state supporters have neither a 401k or stocks, right? Yet, you’re going to allow Congress to cut their Medicare and SS which they HAVE paid into, right?

1810 2018-08-30 12:01:54 The very wealthy own most of the stocks, so this does fuck-all for the majority. I’d bet that 90% of the people who liked your tweet aren’t even stockholders or owners of 401Ks.

1813 2018-08-30 12:00:39 The market is inflated because the corporations are buying out their stocks with the tax money ( that you said would create jobs & raise wages which didn't happen) Majority of Americans don't have 401K & their wages are not keeping up with inflation.
1814 2018-08-30 12:00:12 A stock market, or stock exchange, is a place where stocks are bought and sold.

1817 2018-08-30 11:58:34 Over 93 percent of the stock is owned by top 20 percent of households. The bottom 80 percent of households owns about 7 percent of stock. This includes direct ownership of stocks and indirect ownership through mutual funds, trusts, IRAs, Keogh plans and other retirement accounts.

1821 2018-08-30 11:56:59 There you have it, you aren’t worried about the ‘forgotten’ people or you would realize that they have no stocks and can’t afford to save money in a 401k because they need every dollar to live. You’re only worried about enriching yourself.
1822 2018-08-30 11:56:00 It does not mean crypto is a scam  It means the traders or pump & dumpers are scammers. Secondly the whole space is still very young. Its still growing evolving & developing.  Come on man. There use to be so much more pump & dumpers with the stocks before the markets matured.
1823 2018-08-30 11:55:41 " Little Jeff Z "? Again with the name calling? What are you? 12?
And AT&T made hundreds of millions from your tax cut while buying back stocks and getting rid of many of their workers and not raising the wages. Trickle down...? Yeah. From the richest to the "only" rich.
1824 2018-08-30 11:55:32 Most people don’t own stocks. Do something that helps people.
1825 2018-08-30 11:54:50 Hey Ankit, there are enough stocks, stay tuned to Flipkart on 4th September 2018 as we can't ensure.
1826 2018-08-30 11:54:42 Thanks Jason! At the moment they're just available until stocks last but if we decide to add them to our core range we'll be sure to announce it on our social media! It's great to hear you like them 
1827 2018-08-30 11:53:45 10% of the country owns 85% of the stocks bragging that the already well off are even more well off shows out out of tune you are with real America. For most of the country our wages are shrinking when adjusted for inflation, as indicated by the slowing of consumer spending.
1828 2018-08-30 11:53:22 Decent company.. I used TD back when it was just Ameritrade I think. Now I’m recently interested in penny stocks & they have the “think or swim platform”, which is cool, but I wished it was less than $7 for the tiny stuff like penny stocks. Then I could invest many more pennies.
1829 2018-08-30 11:52:50 Unfortunately those things ur bragging abt don't affect everyday Americans or people struggling on minimum wage. They don't have stocks or 401ks, they live paycheck to paycheck.What are u doing for them?? Answer, nothing. And they will be hurt even more by ur tariffs. #outoftouch

1846 2018-08-30 11:45:08 And what about the 99% who don’t have stocks or 401k, how are they doing?
1847 2018-08-30 11:44:58 Great if you're part of the 1%.

~50% off Americans don't own stocks. Cost of living is up and wages are down so,

1850 2018-08-30 11:44:16 The top 1% of Americans own almost 40% of all stocks. 80% of Americans own just 8% of all stocks. The wealth gap continues to grow, and @realDonaldTrump is celebrating that.

 Ji. Dont tell People who don't buy stocks that Sensex is a reflection of their prosperity.
1852 2018-08-30 11:43:32 The wealthiest 10 percent own 85 percent of stocks, tax cut led to stock buy back increasing financial disparity, threatening the end if SS and Medicare by 2026. Shrinking the middle class, leaving the poor poor!
1853 2018-08-30 11:43:27 85% of people have no stocks
1854 2018-08-30 11:42:14 As I see it, the only reason I should give a damn about what the Fed does is if I buy stocks on margin (effectively using stolen taxpayer money to cash in on the rising stock market). What if I seek to invest in my fellow producers directly using my savings? Any advice for me?
1855 2018-08-30 11:42:05 Yeah. Fantastic work riding the wave that Obama’s policies set in motion for six years before you were a thing.  Also, 50% of stocks in US markets are owned by non-US investors. So...who are you talking to?
1856 2018-08-30 11:41:14 Thank you Obama for fixing the economy!  Too bad the clown in the Whitehouse is trying to ruin the lives of those that don't  have stocks or 401ks. #TrumpGate
1857 2018-08-30 11:40:28 Do you realize a vast majority of your followers don’t have stocks or a 401k they’re more interested in food in their bellies and not being fleeced if they get sick, clean air to breath, education for their kids.  Seems like as normal you only give a damn about the elite, so sad

1860 2018-08-30 11:39:51 I think the flattening of the yield curve is a concern. As stocks climb higher it becomes more difficult to find good stocks with high free cash flows selling at a discount. I’m looking forward to the B. Quick interview with W. Buffett.
1861 2018-08-30 11:39:44 What about all of us who didn't get a pay raise? Who don't have stocks? Who wonder about healthcare? Who have to work more than one job to make ends meet? Who worry about climate change, clean water and air? What about the MAJORITY of the people, Trump????
1862 2018-08-30 11:39:20 Well, I’m poor. No stocks. No 401k.  So I’m still screwed.

1866 2018-08-30 11:38:11 Sorry, but Michael Moore’s tweet is correct; 46% of Americans do not own any stocks or mutual funds. Of the 54% that do, ownership is concentrated in the top 20%. These were easy to find facts btw...
1867 2018-08-30 11:37:45 me neither.... (was surrounded by lots of pirate pretenders at hove on monday, all teh storm lot got more and more pirate like in their cheers as the alcohol stocks reduced....!)

1869 2018-08-30 11:36:33 Talking to the 1%? Because most Americans don't own stocks, and few "have made a fortune" in the stock market. But we don't have your buddies' insider trading info either.
1870 2018-08-30 11:36:20 @SportsBoyTony @KenCarman so illegaly trading stocks, outrage! Illegaly obtaining information on a federal investigation? Meh.
1871 2018-08-30 11:36:03 Pay raise? Nope. Job security? Nope. Healthcare? Sucks and can't afford it. Gas and groceries? Going up in price. Housing? Going up in price. I'm sooooo glad your stocks are soaring because you haven't done sh!t for the rest of us.
1872 2018-08-30 11:36:01 @realDonaldTrump our stocks and 401k are climbing!! It's all thanks to you Mr. President!! As a police family (hubz just retired after 30 yrs as a Cincinnati Police Sgt) we can now breathe a little easier!

1876 2018-08-30 11:34:19 Buying stocks for my 401K is really expensive now. This sucks.
1877 2018-08-30 11:33:57 Does Trump actually live in the real world? Let's all just go and check our stocks to see if we've made a fortune.
1878 2018-08-30 11:33:47 Stocks do me no good at all, living in poverty.  How can you raise the poor to be billionaires?  The world still sucks for the poor.  You have stopped the Democrats who want to make everyone poor like Venezuela but how can you make everyone rich?  I need to know.  Thanks you.
1879 2018-08-30 11:33:24 The only people who make a 'fortune' in the market are the rich and powerful. The poor / middle calls cannot afford to go out an buy 10,000 shares of Apple or other high tec stocks. Glad your manipulation of the tax codes helped someone on your level of wealth. Big day.
1880 2018-08-30 11:32:42 funny, my 401k has not rose like you are claiming.  Again dumbass, the Dow IS NOT indicative of the total market.  30 stocks, price weighted and get swapped out if earning issues as not to drag down the index.  but you do not have a college education that was earned.

1889 2018-08-30 11:30:02 what about the majority of the American population that doesn't own stocks or have a 401K? Oh yeah, right, you and the GOP don't care about them.
1890 2018-08-30 11:29:42 The key to all this REMAINS, the disposable income left at the end of the month to the middle class. Stocks, unemployment data are all wonderful ..but after the bills are paid, can we all go out to dinner? Take vaca? Fix cars without pain?
Anyone have a metric?
1891 2018-08-30 11:29:40 I bet there is a lot of insider trading regarding trumps . Bet if you look at what stocks trumps companies or there kids are buying will co inside with Donald trumps announcements ,
1892 2018-08-30 11:29:25 Precisely! 

There's a good change no more money would be addressed of the investor thought that c£18k equates to £280 p/a income.

1894 2018-08-30 11:28:49 The BBC reported that to conserve stocks, the French were not supposed to fish where they were doing with the ensuing fracas, until October to May.  This too I believe was something introduced by the French.

1896 2018-08-30 11:27:42 The  stock market fell on Thursday due to weakness in rupee and profits. In the banking, auto and financial stocks, the Sensex declined by 33 points to 38,690 and the Nifty ended 15 points down at 11,677 levels.

** Asia markets broadly lower amid news of a planned telco merger in Australia

** European stocks slump amid NAFTA negotiations; GAM -10%
1898 2018-08-30 11:27:24 Translation: Those without either can suck it!

80% of stocks are owned by the extremely wealthy.
1899 2018-08-30 11:27:10 What about those who can’t afford to invest in stocks?
1900 2018-08-30 11:27:04 your tweet just shows how completely disconnected you are to the People. If stocks rise it doesn't do anything for the average American. If stocks fall the average American loses their jobs.
1901 2018-08-30 11:26:51 Fool most people don’t make a fortune in stocks only your rich friends
1902 2018-08-30 11:26:39 The best fix to this is to draw 3 stocks a round instead of 2. With 3P you have enough to bump it to 4 stocks. This has brought me way more enjoyment. Also the advanced side is a must.
1903 2018-08-30 11:26:33 Today's Alarm ; The stocks of patience seem to have dried up.
1904 2018-08-30 11:26:26 Hows that work for the majority of the population that don't have stocks?
1905 2018-08-30 11:26:16 More Americans than not don’t have investments in 401Ks or stocks.  They’re not seeing anything but stagnant wages and rising costs. Especially in healthcare since you and the GOP have tampered with Obamacare. Where is the cheaper, better healthcare you promised?
1906 2018-08-30 11:26:08 realDonaldTrump A successful nation isn't based solely on 401k's and the stock market.  In fact the top 1% own the vast majority of stocks.  Sure, people like you are making money, but the average American is likely losing with your destruction of Obamacare and deregulations.
1907 2018-08-30 11:26:07 realDonaldTrump You do realize that approx 50% of America's stocks are owned by non-American's right?  Want to help the bulk of Americans?  Raise the minimum wage, and implement a medicare for all.

1909 2018-08-30 11:25:48 I just think it's very important to him that stocks are up, and there would be a point where that serves to change his thinking on policy. Now, of course we can debate where the strike price is.
1910 2018-08-30 11:25:00 KSE-100 down 385 points to 41863; KSE-100 Index declined 385.92 points to close at 41863.52, 109 stocks closed up 211 closed down while 19 stocks remained unchanged. Volume Nimir Resins Limited closed at Rs 11.98 down 0.53 paisa.
1911 2018-08-30 11:24:58 A lot of people don't have 401k's.  A lot of people don't buy stocks.  What about those people?
1912 2018-08-30 11:24:54 The only way,401k benefits anyone is if they cash out their stocks B4 the coming market Crash

1915 2018-08-30 11:24:01 The management of UK fish stocks will return to our government and will not be subject to the EU's interference. As for the fish that is not eaten there will still be still exports. If you mean the species we don't currently eat then education of the public is the way to go.
1916 2018-08-30 11:23:57 Lol. And probably 50 percent of Americans own no stocks at all
1917 2018-08-30 11:23:00 Wish I had some stocks maybe I can fix things around this house
1918 2018-08-30 11:22:49 Oh good. So those of us that are too busy paying bills to afford buying stocks are still fucked. Great.

In the past they have respected the May-October period of non-fishing to conserve stocks, but not this year. Yes, another set up to promote their brexit
1920 2018-08-30 11:22:06 The wheat quality seems to be the key factor for Russia's exports but not so-called likely curbs. Export stocks at the South have been reduced due to record pace of shipments. Central Russia (closest to South) faces a sharp drop in quality. Just 44% of food wheat vs 56% feed one.

2051 2018-08-30 09:31:53 52% of Americans own stocks (it should be more). Unions are extortion and a violation of their property rights. 
The best economy comes from real savings and investment in production. Somebody has to sacrifice save and invest. You're stealing from the most responsible people.

2054 2018-08-30 09:30:50 In three days 100 index went down around 1100 points. Wiping off billions invested in stocks. General sentiment of the business community is also negative. They are confused... rather afraid.

2056 2018-08-30 09:29:47 I will invest 100m in real estate especially in areas that fit with government plans. Then 50 million in stocks and high risk invests. Then 200m in mutual funds and other low risk invests that can give me a return of 12% ever 3 months which is about 20 million that I can live on.

2060 2018-08-30 09:26:23 There's a difference between stocks and earnings. Rising stocks mean company's reputation is good and it has bright future. Go*** may earn more and adds to profit. But twice is the reason why stocks are rising. I mean they are the best asset in kpop rn.
2061 2018-08-30 09:24:41 A good man. But Trump's agenda since the campaign has always been the ecomony and his efforts were in those areas he promised and he has been delivering on .

2062 2018-08-30 09:23:41 Inherently, the nature of the equity markets has not changed. It is only that

(a) we have verifiable data to prove wealth generation through stocks is possible

(b) market-linked products are sold very differently

(c) higher disposable income => greater risk appetite
2063 2018-08-30 09:23:00 Many “Experts” out there are starting to pick apart the $afmd deal. IMO this has now  become one of the best Risk V Reward bio stocks out there. R&D bio companies can only survive if they can land deals like this. Most have none or will ever land one. My money stays here.
2064 2018-08-30 09:22:14 the short answer is "because they know the rich people will pay it back", isn't it? You're willing to lend at low risk if there's low returns; for higher risk, you demand higher returns. Same as investing in stocks. It's not a MORAL answer, but that's WHY it happens
2065 2018-08-30 09:19:19 But sadly when all hell breaks lose, even stocks with a perceived margin of safety take a beating! Making it even more attractive but dampening the spirits.

2098 2018-08-30 08:55:41 The anger voiced by the French fisherman interviewed on UK TV was caused by their having scallop stocks taken by UK fishermen while they were prohibed by law from taking these stocks for themselves.

2123 2018-08-30 08:31:21 The British are causing damage to stocks and the seabed when they fish. The French fishermen are fishing ethically. But don't let facts get in the way of your lies.
2124 2018-08-30 08:30:58 I've done bills and stocks since '09, trading as a day trader is only practical in a stable market.

2126 2018-08-30 08:30:10 That's why i said it is very difficult and takes real skills to identify such stocks - There should be disbelievers too, if everyone goes optimistic that is not the right situation for the company or stock !!
2127 2018-08-30 08:29:43 Am also amazed at how regularly you find so many diverse stocks....
2128 2018-08-30 08:29:38 So we can once again destroy the fish stocks with brutal fishing techniques, as demonstrated by the UK scallop boat off Normandy this week which simply scooped up the sea bed and destroyed carefully nurtured stocks.
2129 2018-08-30 08:28:51 I kno right. 
problem is we're now short on stocks; that red thing is no longer sold in the market means we wouldn't be able to produce it for the targeted amount. Criiiiiii ;(
2130 2018-08-30 08:28:27 It's published by the Dept of Health. Both May & her health secretary are remainers. It repeats the fact that Frances' Sanofi is increasing its stocks by 4 weeks to 14 weeks. It says the NHS will have a 6 weeks stock. Do you think the NHS normally operates on zero weeks stock?
2131 2018-08-30 08:28:24 I do think @BBCNews caused part of it. People trust Aunty BBC and they just seem to have gone AWOL. This issue was not about Johnny Foreigner but about conserving stocks, fairness and the French getting cross (in a bad way).

2201 2018-08-30 07:29:25 The real key to trading: Accept that you need two games. 1) Actively seek entries when a window of opportunity lies ahead (decisive action). 2) switch into power save mode and let the stocks do the work (Patience). It is VERY tough to switch back and forth between 1) and 2).

2259 2018-08-30 06:40:57 Partly true. large part of outperformance is  probably due to US corporate buying back their stocks like there is no tomorrow whereas in EU no one is buying shares and EM are net share issuers. Indeed very hard to find companies that buyback in EM.

2287 2018-08-30 06:25:00 Could it be that demonetisation was actually a grand conspiracy to convert black money into white, legalise ill-gotten wealth, herald Acche Din for black money hoarders while pretending to wage war on them?

2294 2018-08-30 06:21:58 We are fishing in their waters at a time the French Govt. has banned their own to conserve dwindling stocks.  Imagine if the roles were reversed? You would be demanding the British Govt did something.
2295 2018-08-30 06:19:15 For years UK fishing took the high moral ground. We protected fish stocks and nurtured them.
Now it's our vessels fishing in the scallop spawning season while the French hang back?

2297 2018-08-30 06:18:40 There's an argument for a severe size restriction on fishing vessels. The larger boats cost much more to buy and run which in turn requires more sea time and that puts more pressure on fish stocks. Sea fishing is akin to piracy of a common resource which requires policing.

2321 2018-08-30 05:59:05 UK fishermen have done this before. Trawlers were fishing around Iceland in the 1960s and early 70s because they had overfished cod elsewhere. North Sea cod stocks only returned to sustainable levels in 2017, after EU strategies worked. UK fishermen want to overfish again.

2419 2018-08-30 04:39:21 Just my opinion, but coaches have raved about his talent in the past, too. Consistency/effort was what lost him a first-team spot. I really like what I’ve seen from Caesar Williams and Faion Hicks lately, though.

2421 2018-08-30 04:37:43 Just to be sure lol, your savings are in stocks and other assets, just not in a checking account at the bank right? I remember that you didn't have a cell phone (same for me) so I was wondering if you are one of those few who have cash hidden under their bed Chris Hu did & lost
2422 2018-08-30 04:37:20 Not enough... Big Pharma created this mess and you let them continue to do so because you have stock in big pharma and love making money on those stocks!

2427 2018-08-30 04:35:36 Market portfolio should contain all risky assets, not just stocks. That's stated in the CAPM paper also. If an anomaly, like low vol, correlates with other asset classes, like bonds, then that anomaly is reduced. Measuring beta against stocks only in not the real test.

2429 2018-08-30 04:34:28 Yeah, but I’m having trouble factoring O into it... may have been a slow roll leftover from W...? Stocks were pretty stagnant those last 8 yrs, 8.5%, but flat... i think the market correction from housing bubble collapse skewed the average a little and O got a boost from that...

2434 2018-08-30 04:31:53 pretty much, with ETFs, one can hedge into Euro, USD and etc. I have 75% in IVV and 25% in ASX stocks with USD exposure, so far its done well. If AUD goes to 60cents, my returns will be 20-30% p.a for the past 4-5 years, not bad if that happens.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.88 percent.
2443 2018-08-30 04:25:13 It’s not really a technical “trend.” And whether it is or isn’t is besides the point.  It is just another reason to proceed wth caution. And no 59 year old should be 100% stocks regardless.

UK fisherman say they are the minority fishers (taking only 5%).

2510 2018-08-30 03:39:45 Why? This country is on the best economical boom in 50 years! Record breaking stocks, more jobs than people looking, lowest unemployment. Only a traitor would want this to stop.
2511 2018-08-30 03:38:12 Yea once I found XRP I couldn’t even look at the other ones. Glorified stocks if you ask me.

2515 2018-08-30 03:35:58 Why is this a good idea? Certainly, trading stocks & running a biz should be very restricted while in office. Not having access to one’s own funds while maintaining 2 residences & theoretically taking 1 parent out of the household for half the year? Ugh
2516 2018-08-30 03:35:11 Y’all investing in broken Crypto but not stocks? Geeesh
2517 2018-08-30 03:34:17 Looks like Hannity has got fatter on his own bullshit. There is so much more at stake this election than the stock price of stocks that very FEW americans actually own. The market is doing well and affects the RICH only - like Hannity - Make no mistake about that.
2518 2018-08-30 03:34:17 You can slam these coils to the ground but im on a 1.75 drop cause im still on stocks. Once im on 18’s ill do a 2.5 inch drop.
2519 2018-08-30 03:34:02 The girls picked apparel and the boys picked video games. Buffett holds value stocks for the long term. He made a mistake with WFC however. No one is perfect I guess although Peter Lynch was amazing with the Magellan fund.

2527 2018-08-30 03:27:42 The assumption of GOI & RBI about black money stocks, in hindsight, appears flawed. No one disputed the existence of black money, most are taken aback by how it was laundered and returned to the banking system...

2540 2018-08-30 03:20:42 I'm sorry, do you own like 2 million shares of Amazon and Apple?  Yes, many of us own stocks and they will help our retirement some.  However some people own enough to fund the next 10 generations of their family.
2541 2018-08-30 03:20:32 The goal of (1) someone finding statistical factors for use in an index fund is not comparable to (2) what Munger or David Tepper do in picking individual stocks. They are as different as night and day.  Maybe 3% of active managers can do (2) with alpha after fees says Munger.
2542 2018-08-30 03:19:31 From your blog: "the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in fulfillment centers, including cash, stock, and incentive bonuses, is over $15 an hour." Why not pay full timers STARTING at $15/hr, then stocks/bonuses? MultiBILLION $ company should have no trouble with that.

2552 2018-08-30 03:13:48 Well said about markets, you have deep understanding about markets, always retail investors suffer because they buy at higher valuations with greed and sell at lower valuations with fear. better strategy is to buy high quality stocks in SIP mode so that we can exit in profits.
2553 2018-08-30 03:12:57 Your adani port did well yesterday. It would be more helpful if u could share the parameters that u set to search these stocks.
2554 2018-08-30 03:12:42 I hear you- fwiw, Financial stocks make up  ~ 15% of SP 500
2555 2018-08-30 03:11:31 The Dems are working for big corps in same way as GOP. They just try to be more subtle. The GOP tax laws and reg repeals that pumped up stocks will stay in place. Pence>Trump for stocks. Only downside scenario is economy tanks then we get huge progressive Dem wave in 2020.
2556 2018-08-30 03:11:28 A famous philathropist gave malaria nets. And people used them as herring nets. Only they were coated in chemicals. So coastal West Africa ends up with depleted and inedible fish stocks. They asked him to stop helping. Help needs earned participation or it will be abused...
2557 2018-08-30 03:11:24 Stocks may get smashed in short term from being overextended, but Colorado, Oregon, California all allow legal recreational marijuana sales. Stores on every corner like Starbucks. No major regulatory hurdles besides tax payments. Proof of concept is a reality.

2565 2018-08-30 03:07:33 Isn't playing on price a short term phenomena? And that at some point market adjusts to a rational price? Can we hold these stocks for 3-5 years? I think it's more of a short term momentum play.

2568 2018-08-30 03:06:35 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks plowed to new records amid a broad rally in technology shares, as investors speculated the Trump administration will make progress this week on trade spats. Oil surged toward $70 a barrel.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.88 percent.
2569 2018-08-30 03:05:38 Not sad at all. These are used ones or dead stocks. This way comes into reach of those serious readers who can't afford a new one. In my city too, there is regular such bazaar on Sundays.

2580 2018-08-30 02:56:09 I don't think you're the only one who has noticed. But I do think like stocks celebrities tr to spread things around as best the could. Maybe opening up a factory is not something they are drawn to so they go the stem route as a means to an end.

2583 2018-08-30 02:55:11 But now , 401k, stocks, and investments excite me.
2584 2018-08-30 02:54:38 coming from a man who scammed people selling junk stocks.. makes sense
2585 2018-08-30 02:54:02 MSM STATS.
Wages are stagnant-not based on facts.
Prices are going higher- value dollar is greater
A lot of people own 401ks (stocks)- 52% millennials, 80% boomers,75 % of Gen-Xers
Minimum wage earners have never paid taxes. Middle up to 120,000 tax breaks
Trickle down= jobs.

2613 2018-08-30 02:32:22 That's why tracking is VERY important. Even 2-3 such stocks in your portfolio (from this 7%) can change your life. 
Problem is people don't track closely or lose patience.

It's not easy for sure but with constant trial & error one can get a couple of such stocks & that's enough.
2614 2018-08-30 02:31:59 Let’s review:

Tax cuts for rich and corps barely trickling down.

Federal deficit way up.

2618 2018-08-30 02:29:48 That's definitely a fair point. It would be different if the markets were being manipulated. I would still argue that, with two sides to every trade, he is buying/selling his stocks from/to somebody else who doesn't have the same information as he does.

2638 2018-08-30 02:21:46 Argentina is in a full-blown recession RN, and the stocks are getting pulverized. Looking at $BMA - this is a bank that (during this recession) grew revs by 40% in Q2. Down 72% since Oct, and now pays a 5% divy. When to catch the falling knife? 6x earnings, 4x forward, 1.4x book.

2644 2018-08-30 02:20:23 @JohnLegere So my colleague seems to think that telling you how I was treated would change the fact that this event caused me to scramble for another carrier & sell my tiny stocks would make a difference now. The same important difference it would have made 4 my fam had TM cared.
2645 2018-08-30 02:19:49 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks plowed to new records amid a broad rally in technology shares, as investors speculated the Trump administration will make progress this week on trade spats. Oil surged toward $70 a barrel.

 The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.88 percent.
2646 2018-08-30 02:18:30 Asian stocks posted modest gains, tracking a rise in U.S. equities after a better than expected reading on the U.S. economy and a rally in tech shares buoyed sentiment.

2704 2018-08-30 01:49:14 I don't know how long or if you've had money in stocks.  Mine and most others tanked in 2008 when DJIA went from 14K to 6K and they were built back up over the Obama years to 19K.  If you look at the numbers, the trendline is pretty much the same pace as under Obama and Trump.
2705 2018-08-30 01:49:10 If win will be big bucks. Lose same whatever  put down no more or less . That's why people likes options better than others. Also no need too much money to play stocks like common shares

2753 2018-08-30 01:24:24 When I say uncorrelated asset classes, what I’m really doing is not using the classic measure of correlation, like stocks and bonds are forty percent correlated. What I am instead really referring to is, do you know how they behave and is it going to intrinsically behave. RD
2754 2018-08-30 01:24:15 saaaamme. You'll prosper, I know it! You got me back into stocks definitely
2755 2018-08-30 01:23:11 @DAWGS4LIFE I love the sneaky stocks like $VRS
2756 2018-08-30 01:21:14 Super Bullish news, this scammer is saying bitcoin will go to 0. He also said you'd get rich buying his penny stocks!!!!

A scammer telling you 1 thing, you should know it will be the exact opposite!!!!!!!
2757 2018-08-30 01:21:03 Players can fail drug tests and beat their girlfriends like clock work and still have a job, but Mychal Kendricks cashes out his stocks before they tank and he gets released. Oh ok.
2758 2018-08-30 01:19:07 my stock investing strategy influenced from @EddyElfenbein, I will not sell, trim profits, or rebalance any positions until Aug/fall 2020, Aug/fall 2022, and every 2 years after that. Forces me to pick better stocks, stay long, and not to panic sell.

2770 2018-08-30 01:12:59 Rich white republican from redder than red 
Ohio. He got his tax cut, his stocks are going up, and it doesn't matter what insurance costs - he can afford it. His God is in the White House totally looking out for HIS best interests.
2771 2018-08-30 01:11:35 Tax cuts are causing a deficit and the middle class didn't see much of a tax cut, if any. Corporations used it to buy back stocks.
2772 2018-08-30 01:10:28 Sell your medical device stocks, and stop supporting Copper mining in the BWCA. Refuse all the donations Glencore Polynet copper mining are giving you, then you won’t feel  obligated to vote to allow them to contaminate our beautiful Boundry Waters!
2773 2018-08-30 01:09:59 Like Azeez, you can start with value stocks and watch that hoe grow in  a couple years
2774 2018-08-30 01:06:41 Wow , i haven't seen purple stocks like that before ...  Is that a characteristic of your strain ?  Is this your " woppa " ?
2775 2018-08-30 01:05:31 Anyone here knowledgeable on stocks & trading? #needhelp
2776 2018-08-30 01:05:07 It’s exhausting watching my stocks go up. I don’t even need to work out anymore. The feeling I get is the same ... #investingiseasy
2777 2018-08-30 01:04:41 VOTING Democratic in November 2018 will INCREASE your TAXES (that's a given!) DECREASE your 401k (that's a given!) And if YOU have any STOCKS~ Kiss them babies goodbye!! Could lose UP to 40%=50%? YOU heard this from ME. on Twitter (RETWEET this TWEET, please)
2778 2018-08-30 01:03:52 Exactly you can’t make this stuff up. How bout that Hard Knocks episode with Carl N talking interest and finance. Dude’s gotta run a stocks fraud class now.

2783 2018-08-30 01:02:03 They buy bonds, forcing yields to clear below natural levels. That makes bond holding strategies arguably riskier, forcing investment into better returning instruments... like Vancouver condos and stocks.
2784 2018-08-30 01:01:33 That’s why I said “to me”. When you make most money with stocks and options past 19 months, he is my hero. LoL
2785 2018-08-30 01:01:12 Robin hood app @RobinhoodApp  released 250 more international stocks you can invest in. Thanks @AnthonyCopeman
2786 2018-08-30 01:00:25 Every summer I stock up on Old Pro like an old lady stocks up on sweet n low packets
2787 2018-08-30 00:59:37 I’m not really its just I don’t know where to start cuz everything has hella pros and cons.
If you don’t have a lot to invest you don’t have the luxury to diversify and most consistent/established stocks are relatively expensive 

I don’t know what makes the most sense right now
2788 2018-08-30 00:58:39 BUY IT NA PLS GET ALL THE STOCKS SO I WON'T BE TEMPTED ANYMORE
2789 2018-08-30 00:57:41 stocks in Rah has proved to be very profitable. will continue investing and maximizing my portfolio.
2790 2018-08-30 00:57:39 Hold on to the position and switch overvalued stocks, from investing basket to trading basket in mind...and then use trading skills to decide when to exit the position.

As per this.... You can never decide when to sell but wait for the market to give you signals.
2791 2018-08-30 00:56:38 nothing but blue chip stocks for you today
2792 2018-08-30 00:56:20 In 1995, all the listed stocks on the Nasdaq were not worth $1 trillion.  Now Apple alone is.  Pretty wild.
2793 2018-08-30 00:52:48 IM GETTING SUCKED INTO THESE STOCKS!!!!!!!!! I need to quit before I start investing every time they come out with a new app. Literally have 3 different stock accounts.
2794 2018-08-30 00:51:49 I have a sense of humor and Dan Nathan is not the least bit funny. He’s a self-loathing HATER with Trump Derangement Syndrome. It makes sense that he prefers shorting because shorting stocks specifically HURTS companies and possibly causes job losses. Nathan is an awful “person”!
2795 2018-08-30 00:50:56 hope tomorrow stocks don’t be too much 
2796 2018-08-30 00:50:30 Connor is a merperson who trades stocks as a day job.

2799 2018-08-30 00:48:52 GEX is higher even with call buying/stocks ramping? Am I thinking about this wrong?
2800 2018-08-30 00:47:37 Lol that’s hilarious, that’s me and the guys at work...me grumpy =stocks down
2801 2018-08-30 00:44:21 Wife knows when stocks down. " so, the pot stocks are down, eh.. You've shut up about them for the last few weeks"
2802 2018-08-30 00:43:47 Winding down after a slow but hot work day, watching some St. Louis Cardinals baseball for a little while, glad stocks up again today.
2803 2018-08-30 00:42:46 But your focus is always on the US situation. What's different elsewhere? Hasn't it ALWAYS been vis-a-vis? I mean currency/rates/stocks.
2804 2018-08-30 00:42:37 #fanniegate 2 Fortune 50 icons in a 10yr temp/perm conservatorship trade as penny stocks (OTC) between investors with 0 rights to any assets of these ct-affirmed pvt co's, ruled by an unconstit agency, headed by a morally corrupt director. FACT NOT FICTION
2805 2018-08-30 00:42:26 Lol good one. I love that your not telling her and she prob doesn’t care about stocks right?  Typical
2806 2018-08-30 00:42:06 At least he can stay in shape in prison, and he made more money off stocks then with the browns
2807 2018-08-30 00:40:11 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2808 2018-08-30 00:39:50 That's a bit of a fallacy because these aren't stocks and the coins don't represent equity.  $7000 is just the going rate for a single bitcoin based on perceived future demand for that bitcoin.  We can't compare market caps to stocks.
2809 2018-08-30 00:39:48 Maybe, but there are so few of us interested at this point.  There will be pull backs but as #Uranium becomes more main stream there will be more and more buyers out there! It all depends on U prices!  If they continue to rise, the stocks have one way to go!  1000s of % away!
2810 2018-08-30 00:39:38 If you pickup some #Salesforce #CRM on the dip. You made a great upside bet if the earnings beat has anything to say about it. #stocks

2812 2018-08-30 00:39:02 If you told me 25 years ago I would be making $$$ trading marijuana stocks, I woulda thought you were high...
2813 2018-08-30 00:36:46 The extra charts and lines people use for TA is really OD. Price history and volume really all I look at.  I know about 3-4 patters if that really well and that’s all I need. Especially for high  volatility stocks. It’s all the same. People are the same
2814 2018-08-30 00:35:26 It’s not free just the profits go back into the company to build the infrastructure to get better technology.  To hire better qualified techs & to give better pricing to customers.  It doesn’t go into the pockets of greedy executives or buyback stocks just to raise the price
2815 2018-08-30 00:32:49 the love blows the air, the objective stocks makes the ditzy dead
2816 2018-08-30 00:32:23 It's complicated, but boils down to Target not opting to carry many. However, with some support I'm hopeful they'll renew their stocks.
2817 2018-08-30 00:31:16 Teaching a stripper bout stocks
2818 2018-08-30 00:31:08 What am I interested in?
Stocks 
Bonds
Real estate
Anything financial
2819 2018-08-30 00:30:26 Day and swing trade the hell out of me while you can. Make profit mitigate risk by leaving positions is my play. FOMO to extreme levels on stocks already overvalued.

2821 2018-08-30 00:26:14 Well I think token narratives are akin to fan chants at pro wrestling events or applause for Tinkerbell and partly why we don't see outrage is that many outwardly equating alts with stocks (and buying them) inwardly accept that the altcoin casino game is a participatory fiction.
2822 2018-08-30 00:23:46 Hey everyone invest in stocks and your Roth IRA you'd be amazed how much money you collect over the years
2823 2018-08-30 00:23:39 I own a few u stocks and I’ll say I’ve seen a big amount of high fiving and many who have the fortune already spent.  The bullishness is thru the roof.  Not sure what it means but perhaps we gonna get a decent pullback
2824 2018-08-30 00:23:35 Wow my #Amazon stocks are about to hit 2K ea. Sooner than I expected BUT I still hate the fucking company and of course the fucking dirty ass scandalous ass CEO @JeffBezos fucking ass!!!! #FuckYouBezos #FuckAmazon #AmazonAintShit #AmazonIsTrash #Garbage
2825 2018-08-30 00:20:52 There is no evidence tax cuts benefited the middle class. All benefits for rich CEOs who bought back their stocks. What about those republican tariffs ?
2826 2018-08-30 00:20:45 I don’t why you dumb wits keep saying this, y’all have short-term memory loss. Our economy was in a bad shape the end of 2015 when stocks fell to 15k and 2016. Market gained back confidence when Trump was elected and the economy is booming. Consumer confidence is at 18 year high.
2827 2018-08-30 00:18:14 @jack_brooklyn7 Hey how’s everything I am sorry about last night I don’t like to make enemies so forgive me if I said something made you mad I apologize. If you need anything especially about stocks I love to help take care and love to hear from you
2828 2018-08-30 00:17:54 Not only FB, but Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Twitter...... And don’t expect govt to step in. Those five stocks mentioned represents 20% of the market cap of the 3200+ stocks traded on Nasdaq. It has to come within as employee lawsuits
2829 2018-08-30 00:16:02 You got that exactly right, except one part...
It's the White House being torn apart from the inside and you all are laughing stocks. I am impressed, though, that you can spell better than your father and certainly are more articulate. But the name calling, immature. Grow up, Jr
2830 2018-08-30 00:15:57 idk why yall spending $100 on nails $400 on hair etc, that will never make sense to me if you don’t own a home, have stocks, or actual wealth.
