2 2018-12-12 23:50:49 Esse imbecil deveria entender o porquê do Trump poder falar essas merdas e ele não poder.
País que só produz commodities e não conduz nenhum acordo de bloco, não tem com o que barganhar, é botar a viola no saco e deixar pra quem sabe falar dos acordos sobre clima.
3 2018-12-12 23:48:14 Lo peor es que con toda esta discusión también se muestra el poco conocimiento que se tiene en un país agrícola sobre estrategias para disminuir el riesgo de volatilidad de precios de commodities y de moneda, una gran deficiencia de la educación superior en el país
4 2018-12-12 23:36:22 Hey @mlbtraderumors @Ken_Rosenthal @jonmorosi @JonHeyman you folks report on trade rumors where players are “traceable commodities” It sure would be nice to learn about how rumors impact the psyche of the players whose names come up in rumors. Great humanist angle on rumors!
5 2018-12-12 23:30:22 I certainly don't think the love is that big -we don't have many special services or commodities that they don't already produce themselves or can't get from the EU.
Britain is over-rating it's position and May's figures that spell out the losses are based on best case figures
6 2018-12-12 23:11:43 i dont think it capitalism invented war, but as a species its in our evolutionary biology to value group cohesion and compassion. in-group competition and devaluing of humans as commodities or labor only is bad. humans arent made for hierarchy
7 2018-12-12 23:10:05 Please explain how futures worked for gold, or other commodities
8 2018-12-12 23:06:40 Because Tucker isnt a star, JT is, Tuck is a good glove and thats it, look at the stats, JT is literally the best catcher in baseball, I'll take a proven player, who is the best catcher in baseball, over a "Prospect". Prospects are lottery tickets dude, I want proven commodities
9 2018-12-12 23:03:15 Don't blame you,or her,for being hurt and angry. These companies don't regard people as being human beings. To them,we're simply commodities -something to generate revenue. "The human face of capitalism" is such an ironic expression- it doesn't have a human face.And never will...
10 2018-12-12 23:01:32 No disinflation is slowing inflation ,it is not slowing of some prices like commodities or mobile data .It Is a deceleration in inflation .Cost push or lack of it does not drive inflation,velocity adjusted money does
11 2018-12-12 22:52:31 If it’s serious they’ll both be hot commodities.
12 2018-12-12 22:45:09 Ah claro, no es sólo un tema de commodities.  
Y no es sólo un tema de tipo de cambio.  Este es un tema de un menú de políticas que se requieren apoyar.
13 2018-12-12 22:38:01 I really don't care about the Mason Foster DMs. The Skins org stinks. The fans treat players like commodities instead of humans. Particularly this fan base dogs Foster when he stinks it up. He's allowed frustrations just like any other person at their job.
14 2018-12-12 22:37:07 tem que revogar antecipação tributaria Tem que acabar com os agiotas financeira tem que industrializar commodities materias primas gerar empregos agregar valor tem que investir em mobilidade logistica sobre trilhos para locomover a produção interna aproximar consumidor e produtor
15 2018-12-12 22:35:42 Remembering more, certain taxes are treated as commodities (Co2 and some green taxes) and hedging of these taxes as ”financial speculation”.

17 2018-12-12 22:27:47 not... really, but, kinda, i guess?

that's really only in the case of finished goods though, not commodities, or components though
