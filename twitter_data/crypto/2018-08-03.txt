1 2018-08-03 23:59:44 Alts are not dead.

Crypto is not dead. 

It has gained worldwide attention from regulators, from investors and from outdated competitors. 

Price action will follow. 

Be patient 
2 2018-08-03 23:59:31 Just speaking the truth brother .. my opinion... thanks for judging.. speaks volumes of your character ...90% losses for crypto in 7 months .. that's not negative just truth ..I've already made my millions... not worried #lolsandbetweenyourtoes
3 2018-08-03 23:59:28 What‘s wrong with Dash? I‘m not huge on it, (don‘t even own a single one) but they brought MN into Crypto. Something highly valuable if used in the right way.
4 2018-08-03 23:59:20 Yep, one opinion of a guy who knows a lot about crypto lol
5 2018-08-03 23:59:10 Yeah, I was wondering the same. Now Im confused. Ha
6 2018-08-03 23:59:06 Would it kill Coinbase to use the correct symbol for XRP.....
7 2018-08-03 23:59:03 Then zoom out and look at 18+ months :)

Not even close. Except ones that launched this year into liquid assets of course. But many crypto funds this year are in illiquid VC rounds. Network launches and distributions will kickoff more next year.

9 2018-08-03 23:58:21 YB RM400,000 tu trade crypto. Bulan depan kalau kena tune boleh profit 25-40%. Haha
10 2018-08-03 23:57:39 @thekungfunerd What does it mean to escrow your crypto and is this a good thing?

13 2018-08-03 23:57:21 Yes sir!
14 2018-08-03 23:57:17 $TRX has little utility. Highly speculative. Who is going to use their Tron to buy groceries in Spain and Italy? People use cash and credit cards. Cash is convenient, and credit cards provide incentives. TRX is speculative and most people in crypto hold. BTC spending is down!
15 2018-08-03 23:56:47 まあ時代はCryptoeconomicsいう事やな！
16 2018-08-03 23:56:42 Makes sense , but a loss in crypto is really just hodling
17 2018-08-03 23:56:37 Also your #3 thing to do in Crypto is diversify.
It is as if you flip flopped positions but never said anything about it, unless I missed that video where you revealed a new outlook.
I think your followers also remember this.
That is my viewpoint 
Just rubbed me wrong  I UNSUBSC
18 2018-08-03 23:56:26 Agreed. But again, crypto mass adoption means less trading, more day to day use. The argument here is that ppl got into bcc for increase in fiat, not to trade. Like a bank savings account with returns the longer kept there; not to trade. Thank you sir for conversing with me!

21 2018-08-04 23:58:55 Yes!  Wondering if there are Crypto slot machines 
22 2018-08-04 23:58:25 These so called Crypto enthusiasts aren’t loyal, they just ride the wave when shit is poppin. They not real
23 2018-08-04 23:58:00 Buy dips, sell rips and learn when to sit. 

$btc $crypto
24 2018-08-04 23:56:35 I talk shit when Crypto is down because I can. Most of these dudes only talk when Crypto is on the up but where are they when Crypto is in the trenches? I’ll wait  I’m in this shit
25 2018-08-04 23:56:20 How many hours do you spend on crypto per day? 
26 2018-08-04 23:56:16 素直にロング待機
27 2018-08-04 23:55:16 I would be patient. Why risk a percent of two when we are coming down to $6750 or lower. They probability that we hit $6750 is 95% IMO and 50% that we hit my gaps at $5900

35 2018-08-05 23:59:26 4/4 - Although   gaps are often filled in crypto because of it's  volatility, in many   traditional markets the idea that gaps are always  filled just isn't  true  as trends last many years and don't  significantly retrace..
36 2018-08-05 23:59:15 3/4 - Gaps typically imply a strength in trend but the  implication can  vary depending on their context. They are also seen a   support/resistance and breaking or filling them is usually carries the   inverse sign whichever trend they appear in.
