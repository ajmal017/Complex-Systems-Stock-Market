5 2018-04-15 23:03:43 My thought is that all commodities are traded on supply and demand, if China is not buying commodities from the US, and they buy from someone else, then someone else will buy US commodities that China would have bought.

Bredesen and Blackburn are known commodities.. Both will have adequate money..
The key will be Blackburn rightfully painting Bredesen as just another Schumer vote..and doing it consistently

41 2018-04-15 20:53:28 Foi à época em que o país recebia tubos de dinheiro chinês com a venda do minério de ferro, petróleo e produtos do agronegócio (commodities), mas com a diminuição do pib da China, as vendas caíram e consequentemente esse $ diminuiu no cx do governo e as benesses populistas!
42 2018-04-15 20:40:07 Looking around the world on what creates most crises and conflicts is not the shortage of resources and commodities that lie behind. The problem is more often that someone says saying the right policy and / or religion and is therefore entitled to impose others' views.
43 2018-04-15 20:36:46 Wash sales only apply to securities and options on securities, not intangible property (e.g. cryptos) nor commodities/futures. At least not yet anyway.

47 2018-04-15 19:58:45 Oh yes. How confident are we that IRS will apply wash sale rules to BTC? Does the rule apply to commodities? I think it applies to stocks for sure. 

What if someone had unrealized capital gains, but wanted to sell and buy back in at a lower price within 30 days. Wash sale?
48 2018-04-15 19:50:31 How do you know? People are always (or could always) be out scavenging. They don't talk about how other commodities get back to the settlements. Jesus is out scavenging right now (no matter how stupid it is to send your best hand-to-hand fighter away)

60 2018-04-15 18:03:04 Was food stuff and other commodities highly inflated as this? With your claim of defeating Boko Haram, they worked in and worked out of Dapchi with girls and return them. #LAUGHABLE
61 2018-04-15 17:55:13 I second you @TrevorNcube . he has a lot to prove. You cannot tell me we are going to build airports and spaghetti roads in a country short of basic commodities. We are in a very huge debt and you talk of borrowing 15billion more to stabilize e economy. Sit down!
62 2018-04-15 17:50:47 How is it easier other than access to vc and personal networking? Cost of living, recruiting, burn rate, taxes, etc all worse. Software engineering and infrastructure are commodities.

64 2018-04-15 17:40:30 Exactly,facebook only owns this information because people so freely.
Users need to learn how to use social networks, and the internet as a whole.
These companies just want to use people as commodities.
65 2018-04-15 17:35:43 What his explanation glosses over is that Experiences include Services which include Goods which is made out of Commodities. IOW, it’s not a trajectory but an inclusive layering.
66 2018-04-15 17:34:49 What’s so appealing about Kpop? Do people know that idols are made by companies and manufactured into commodities to be consumed?
67 2018-04-15 17:32:37 No. But Russia, China could accumulate for diversification also silver, platinum and palladium. China already bought large amounts of commodities. But gold remains the strategic asset. A new payment system that circumvents US is in working.

69 2018-04-15 17:19:13 Too true :( Some people would reuse or recycle.. Or just not see people as commodities.
70 2018-04-15 17:17:47 Do you think these tariffs have legs? I don't. Smart market makers, like yourself, would've CRUSHED ag commodities by now. IMO

73 2018-04-15 16:40:01 An oil tanker holds up to 650 000 barrels of oil and behaves much differently that any of the commodities you describe, in the event of a spill or a fire. loading these additional tankers at Westridge Marine Terminal forces them all through Metro Vancouver.
74 2018-04-15 16:27:50 Only my opinion Aaron. It’s a cut throat business for academy players at every age. They’re picked up and dropped like they’re commodities, which sadly they are when everything is about money!

78 2018-04-15 15:53:45 Russia and China i are  working on establishing itself as a world financial power, establishing its own benchmark quotes for commodities such as gold and attempting to dethrone the petrodollar with its petroyuan.
79 2018-04-15 15:47:29 That's not going to prevent tariffs from being imposed. Already we have the USA imposing highly punitive tariffs on many basic commodities. The EU have responded in turn. The WTO has rules about reciprocal arrangements, which could mean we will end up paying similar tariffs.

83 2018-04-15 15:33:15 Now they are crying because the investigation is uncovering more than thought. Didn't they do the same thing to Clinton. From Whitewater to Lewinsky to commodities trading. Trumpie everything is fair game when your in public office and do things your not supposed to.
84 2018-04-15 15:24:50 A tax cut to someone without a job is meaningless. Corporations treat workers like warm bodied commodities when they should be considered co-owners, co-wealth creators.
85 2018-04-15 15:08:19 Animals are offered for free, because that is how a lot of them end up with irresponsible owners, as bait dogs/cats, in households unable to care for them etc. They are not commodities, but being handed around for free is dangerous.
86 2018-04-15 15:08:11 You're right, it's 'pretty good'. 
But politicians on both sides agree our reliance on commodities is short-sighted. I'd love to see some strategic direction & leadership from Oz in energy science & innovation. March for that!

108 2018-04-15 11:17:49 I think it is now the time for the both Houses of Congress to amend the present TRAIN Law to curb its effect on making the prices of basic commodities higher. Thus, I humbly support the call of Senator @bamaquino to review it.
109 2018-04-15 11:16:46 Down pressure on wages, up pressure on cost of living.

So before long the only commodities left to sell are the basic requirements of life. Food, water, shelter.

When they price those out of the market because they can't help the greed people stop following the rules.

115 2018-04-15 10:28:27 I usually explain how I'm over here 'stealing their jobs and their women' and how is that better than someone who brings their own family and sets up a business? (And no, of course I don't *really* think of jobs or women as commodities to be 'stolen'!)

131 2018-04-15 05:59:17 #FX #Crypto #Blockchain #Fintech #Banks #Equities #Indices #Bonds #Commodities
Weekly: FX - $GBP still running. $AUD up a cent, most likely with 5% rise in #Fe.
Commodities - generally firm. Oil +8%. Softs firm - Index +4%. 
#Syria impact in play

...... Weekly: Bonds - Rates steady #EU and #Japan - slightly softer economic numbers. Rates up in #NorthAm and #UK. 
Rate trends still favor US on differentials - ratio or gap
133 2018-04-15 05:45:45 Let's face it...  Women have been viewed as commodities by men with power/money.  They are judged on their exterior assets, (different in different cultures but ALL about sexually pleasing men's whims) and then purchased and traded. Story as old as time. GROSS. Wake up ladies!
134 2018-04-15 05:33:37 Truth has always been a rarest of rare commodities uneffordable to a huge majority only few takers still  Truth shall always remain truth in defiance to falsehood  sir ..
135 2018-04-15 05:12:36 Sim, por isso "maldito ciclo de commodities"...
136 2018-04-15 04:58:11 Ain't you forgetting something. you can't sanction a country that doesn't do it's business in dollars and buys most commodities from Russia and China.
137 2018-04-15 04:57:05 Triangular trade=Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has export commodities that are not required in the region from which its major imports come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying trade imbalances between the above regions.....uhhhhmm!
138 2018-04-15 04:36:17 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
139 2018-04-15 04:24:10 Olha... Eu acho é que tem uma "maioria silenciosa" bem fragmentada aí. Não é porque o povo não foi lá impedir a prisão dele que vai deixar de votar nele ou em quem indicar. Maldito ciclo de commodities!
140 2018-04-15 04:18:49 I wish it weren’t but my fear is that economic thinking affects our social relations. I think we do see each other as commodities... just look at Tinder for evidence haha
141 2018-04-15 04:18:45 one of the best commodities traders ever imo.
142 2018-04-15 04:15:03 Ok. Let's treat him like an economic agent. Let's first give him back his annual deficient of Rs 13 lakh crore due to him because of price restrictions placed in his commodities by govt, cartels, and traders. Then dismantle the price control mechanism fully. Can you ??
143 2018-04-15 04:13:38 Il concentrato di pomodoro è una commodities viene trattato da pochissimi trader internazionali al mondo, che lo pagano mediante lettere di credito solo dopo che societá di certificazioni come Societè Generale ne accertano la qualità. Mangiate sereni

145 2018-04-15 04:03:07 Só acho que no segundo turno a rejeição dele vai pesar bastante, mas, mesmo preso, ele tem chances reais de eleger um candidato indicado. Maldito ciclo de commodities...
146 2018-04-15 03:38:55 Basically anything that trades in the futures market could be tokenized (eg. commodities), plus things like tickets, hotel rooms, time shares, shares of leasing contracts, collectibles, in game assets, essentially *anything* of value
147 2018-04-15 03:38:21 when will the jared kushner homophobic jokes stop? i've said this before, and i'll say it again: no matter how much i disagree with this goddamn administration, it is NEVER OKAY to make offensive personal attacks like this on ANYONE. lgbt+ people are not comedic commodities!
148 2018-04-15 03:09:31 not surprising ppl would declare misha an asshole because he's tired, some fans literally don't see the cast as people but as commodities or products. hence groping photos and "i paid for this" entitlement talk.
149 2018-04-15 03:04:18 So there will be jobs for people in all sectors related to energy commodities & jobs for environmentalists. So yes there will be job creation for people on both sides adressing the financial or economic burden on both provinces. Regulatory bodies & legal groups are on stand by.
150 2018-04-15 02:59:03 These three factors, however, state of prices, quantity of circulating commodities, and velocity of money-currency, are all variable.
151 2018-04-15 02:53:16 Cryotocurrencies seek to create 24-hour market places for digital commodities. We can trade physical goods like gold, wheat, and even electricity. In the same way, we should be able to trade processing power, cloud storage, bandwidth, and other digital products. Wise @cburniske
152 2018-04-15 02:38:46 Honestly, I’m not even sure that’s true. If Smith, Keller, or Hill are for real, they’re more useful commodities than two years of Justin Grimm or Brandon Maurer, or the remains of Blaine Boyer.
153 2018-04-15 02:37:02 Having known people in commodities trading, Bill Clinton's midnight pardon of Marc Rich is still spoken of with the sort of awe one reserves for mafioso

160 2018-04-15 01:54:34 My number 1 reason is it’s time for commodities to shine
161 2018-04-15 01:40:36 Inwentash is a money-maker; he’s at times unorthodox...and anything he does; he makes sure that he’s paid well; like at Pinetree. When the bottom fell out of commodities; Pinetree suffered hugely. There are positives if you want to look; he’s made a lot of people a lot of money!

163 2018-04-15 01:08:27 Omg, nooo, not 2yrs or more as president! I did not vote for him; had hoped he would learn the job and perform the job! His attitude on governing is horrible versus his attitude/dealings in corporate america! We’re not commodities/real estate, we’re humans!
164 2018-04-15 01:07:48 Agree. It's a terminal fault of the current capitalist model, which is premised on the infinite availability of finite commodities, built-in obsolescence and the stimulation of conspicuous consumption. Neoliberalism is the antithesis of responsible capitalism
165 2018-04-15 01:05:14 the growth of Cryptocurrencies may be fueled by investors seeking haven from shaky markets in stocks, bonds, commodities, and real-estate

but Trump seems determined to drive up stock prices of at least Raytheon, Lockheed-Martin, KBR, Haliburton...
166 2018-04-15 01:05:03 Trading is the art of recognizing the value that market applies to the commodities and financial instruments. When trading you need to count on human psychology, as well as the marketing. All these factors impact the price.
167 2018-04-15 01:00:15 In the USA, the SEC says #cryptocurrency and tokens are securities. 

The IRS says its property. 

CFTC says they are commodities.

171 2018-04-15 00:22:13 Capitalism is a system that can only exist when a large portion of the population is in poverty. People are made into commodities and resources to be exploited for the gain of the few.
172 2018-04-15 00:07:26 Looks like everything wants to go up, stocks, commodities, precious metals. Only bonds seem to be hesitant.
173 2018-04-15 00:07:19 Apologies. I thought I addressed externalities in the initial post, questioning policy options of 'banning' versus full costing of commodities. I hadn't thunk of myself as smart, only critical of facile sloganeering.

176 2018-04-14 23:22:16 One of the key reasons beside climate change and NR ssues is the low productivity in the farming sector both smallholder and large farmers -most of our maize farmers are way below regional levels in terms of productivity and not just maize but also cotton & many other commodities

215 2018-04-14 20:34:02 No there won't....we've being saying this for the last few seasons,and it's never happened. The only ones who leave are the saleable commodities who command a good transfer fee.

218 2018-04-14 19:51:41 That's absolutely true, it's packaging up identity into an easily digestible package and shipping it out to be consumed. Ultimately, racialized identities and all other become commodities within the industry instead of the industry becoming more fair and equal.

230 2018-04-14 18:37:39 Legalising the ENTIRE industry normalises that idea that people, especially women, are commodities to be bought and sold which would undoubtedly have a detrimental impact on the position of women and oppressed groups in society.
231 2018-04-14 18:30:03 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
232 2018-04-14 18:27:43 Not in favour of criminalising sex workers at all. However, the most important right is that of women and people in general not to live in a society which deems our bodies to be commodities which are bought and sold.

235 2018-04-14 18:19:51 "Michigan seems like a dream to me now

It's a interesting case study of how power was originally spread out due to commodities exploitation, then focused with industrialization, then diffused again.

237 2018-04-14 18:00:21 “If you hold btc for 25 years you will be the opposite of rich”

This implies that btc will lose parity vs fiat or commodities over time.

There is no empirical evidence to support this imo.

All evidence points to btc appreciation vs fiat/commodities and increasing btc adoption.
238 2018-04-14 17:57:47 I personalize the letter & signed. We lived in WY for 26 years & sadly the prevailing mindset there is "kill it or drill it." Nonhuman animals are seen largely as commodities, pests, &/or targets; much of the state's incredible natural beauty as a resource to plunder for profit.

241 2018-04-14 17:48:44 I say, massive construction of Bauhaus skyscrapers into metro style dwellings is the only solution in the midst of the 6th Great Mass Extinction. Megalopolis networking will be complete when trade routes are simplified. This is all for distribution of commodities by and by.

243 2018-04-14 17:16:26 That's the heart of the debate - horses are herd animals, they love to run as a pack. It's when that natural instinct is abused by greedy humans that they become 'commodities and possessions'
244 2018-04-14 17:12:05 In saying that, I do not doubt that you are motivated by a sincere desire to feed people. I just argue that there are more humane methods of doing that, which do not reduce sentient individuals to the status of mere commodities or products, whose worth can be measured in £€$
245 2018-04-14 17:12:02 Mal de muchos consuelo de tontos, pero así es también en muchos países. Lo bueno es que la nuclear y las renovables no son commodities.

252 2018-04-14 16:56:56 Money is power?  It was land back a couple centuries ago.  Tomorrow?  Commodities?
253 2018-04-14 16:50:12 It’s sad really. That ppl allow themselves to be used that way. Had a v wealthy boyfriend once like DJT. Same MO n he was an “insecure little shit inside” too. They know that without money they are/will be nothing. Money & power is live or die for them & Ppl are commodities too
254 2018-04-14 16:34:19 Ups and downs, while some #NOC deals with their commodities blindly, no #hedging no #arbitrage no #risk_management , just following the waves . This is an idiot way of dealing with #Energy , #OilAndGas and #nations_wealths
255 2018-04-14 16:34:10 I'm currently reading an essay trying to explain the "magic" or "allure" of commodities, using new materialism. wow I can't believe no one's written about this before
256 2018-04-14 16:31:17 Good question it depends on what are the options available and your time horizon, Vanguard funds or etf’s are my choice ( VTI, VWO, VEA , VIG will cover US, developed foreign and emerging markets with 35%, 24%, 15% , 9% ) rest in bonds /commodities
257 2018-04-14 16:29:14 In the USA, the SEC says tokens are securities. 

The IRS says its property. 

CFTC says they are commodities. 

And FinCEN says its money.
258 2018-04-14 16:14:05 Expecting to witness a high increase in commodities prices, especially Crude and petroleum derivatives.
259 2018-04-14 16:13:21 Si comparamos el crecimiento de Brasil, Perú, Argentina, Uruguay en ese mismo periodo notariamos que Uribe no hizo nada excepcional. La economía Colombiana al ser pequeña, abierta y dependiente de los commodities, depende en gran medida de lo que pase con el precio de los mismos.
260 2018-04-14 15:55:49 Pakistan is the major producer of raw cotton, sugar and wheat in addition to many other commodities. “Most of these items are exported in raw or semi-finished from whereas we could earn billion of dollars through value-addition in these products

262 2018-04-14 15:27:58 the only recurring themes i heard are the same i aways hear coming out of #WashingtonDC 

1-#Billionaires can do ANYTHING
2-no real accountability at top of wealth
3-privacy&information r sales commodities
4-criminality manipulates facets of web
5-this is only 1 breech caught
263 2018-04-14 15:27:35 USSR were selling commodities 4 industrial goods, same goes for Tzarist Russia & modern Russia.
Moscow had economic treaty with Nazis, when they attacked,  Russia switched  to the US. Then back to Europe.
It’s eternal model. Over 1000 years. Slaves, wood, grain - you name it.

267 2018-04-14 14:47:55 @joseantoniokast Hola, que piensas de una política fuerte acerca de dejar de depender de commodities y exportar mas bien tecnología basados en ellos? El cobre regresa a chile con un valor que podría ser agregado por nosotros.
268 2018-04-14 14:25:31 Hold it over time and watch it devalue as a result of inflation. Even a high interest bank account doesn't cover inflation. Why do you think anyone with a financial education builds assets and/or puts "savings" into gold and other commodities or stocks. Educate yourself man!
269 2018-04-14 14:24:40 Is that not now a dominant trend? Its taken over commodities where the underlying fundamentals have less to do with price discovery. Its "technical" analysis driving money flows.
270 2018-04-14 14:18:30 Risk assets struggling because Fed tightening; rotation from QE winners (US stocks, tech stocks, US/European high yield bonds, Emerging Markets) to QE losers (cash, commodities, government bonds, volatility) has begun.

274 2018-04-14 13:49:16 When bodies become commodities it’s amazing what folks will come out and say. We end up learning more about fan and media values because we never *really* know the players
275 2018-04-14 13:46:33 Governments around the world is competing to make a field for the youth with innovation but Sri Lanka is still depending on commodities. It’s high time that we diverse our economy to focus on innovation driven market. When will we move from the commodity-based economy #lka ?
276 2018-04-14 13:39:34 Please perish..  journos. As it is ,nothing more than purchasable commodities.
277 2018-04-14 13:34:18 In which we define Commodity:

It's fun to be a buyer. We're in a position to criticize any product offered up to us. But the reality of retail is this: More than the piece of product we criticize, we are also a commodity. And just like all other commodities, we are replaceable.
278 2018-04-14 13:17:15 There isn’t anyone even close NOW, by all means, super fund our military while cutting needed commodities for The American ppl
279 2018-04-14 13:11:18 Just really talking about yourselves and each other like commodities, not even ashamed to share your views. The arrogance and self absorption, astonishing .

281 2018-04-14 13:03:55 They don't see it as a premium position to draft initially, but they're commodities when they're proven like Norwell was in Carolina. Norwell was undrafted.
282 2018-04-14 12:59:11 The industry's view of "animal welfare" is too narrow. Slaughter is detrimental to an animal's wellbeing. My view is that, where alternatives exist, it's unjust to hurt/kill conscious creatures & reduce them to commodities, production units, pieces of property or items of "stock"
283 2018-04-14 12:57:43 How dare you even talk about blatant global bourgeois commodities like blueberries - yet another means to expropriate and trample on the proletariat.
284 2018-04-14 12:41:36 Many trading accounts will be. Rice, commodities etc. Remember KS OILS?
285 2018-04-14 12:39:22 EFF has one of the most precious commodities in politics & life. Youth. No other party is resonating more with young adults and young people who are not even yet of voting age. Whether 2019 or beyond, EFF is the government in waiting. Official opposition at minimum in 2019.
286 2018-04-14 12:35:25 Analysts have a great track record about upgrading equities at the top and downgrading at the bottom.  
Commodities are a different animal.  Look what happened to Andy Hall (oil) and Brian Hunter (natural gas).
287 2018-04-14 12:24:54 @adsteel Great Job w/ "Commodities Edge". 1st two(2) shows excellent.....that show moves, and highly informative..... Thanks!
288 2018-04-14 12:15:08 Huh smfh.... what's wrong with wearing the same outfit over. Where I live that's the norm. If world war were to start and basic commodities were to become scarce. These same people will not have a choice.
289 2018-04-14 12:08:26 Investing in commodities is risky as in the long term they go down in purchasing power. So only invest in them when they are clearly cheaper than production cost. Best prove of that is declining production. This also applies to gold and silver. #investing
290 2018-04-14 12:06:25 We on this planet are getting closer to air and water becoming commodities, not free for the body that needs.
291 2018-04-14 12:05:30 "Shale is the reason we're not trading over $100 a barrel, way more than $100 a barrel," said Francisco Blanch, global head of commodities and derivatives at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
292 2018-04-14 12:02:52 Helima Croft, the head of global commodities strategy at RBC, said it is "realistic" to start thinking about Brent nearing the $80 a barrel mark.
293 2018-04-14 12:01:51 "When you see an escalation in Syria, it raises the risk of escalation in other places. Whether it's Yemen, whether it's eastern Saudi Arabia, or Iran or Iraq, it can foment tensions all across the Middle East," said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays.
294 2018-04-14 11:52:26 By the way conservative commentator Peter Bruce also supported a sovereign wealth fund at one stage during commodities boom 10 years ago.

So nothing unorthodox about this.
295 2018-04-14 11:48:07 Another turmoil on next week...commodities get ready for roller coaster ride..
296 2018-04-14 11:44:51 Final point I'd like to make, we need to keep lifting women and girls  from their low status and keep resisting gender biases discriminatory attitudes that render women and girls as mere sex objects and commodities #EmpowermentHour #JusticeforAsifa #JusticeForZainab @anankemag
297 2018-04-14 11:35:00 #Siria Quando sono iniziati i bombardamenti, i Mercati finanziari erano chiusi. Riapriranno Lunedì (Domenica sera, il forex, invece).

300 2018-04-14 10:46:20 Its not reflecting  on prices of commodities.
301 2018-04-14 10:41:08 Truth & Trust are rare commodities and our Prime Minister doesn't seem to possess either. 
Critical thinking seems to have been lost or in some cases it never existed. 
This is not in any interest except the interests of those seeking to stay in power.

304 2018-04-14 10:17:23 My agenda is animal welfare; it's not just what happens to them on the track even though it's dangerous. It is the exploitation of & treating living creatures like disposable commodities that I cannot stand. You know the truth, you just don't want to acknowledge it.
305 2018-04-14 10:07:36 Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities, so the social process requires standardization of man, and this standardization is called equality

312 2018-04-14 08:40:07 If these air strikes are based on chemical attacks on Syrians.
The chemical attack in Salisbury which the chemicals are said to only have come from chemical factories in Russia why haven't we bombed those factories?

Unless other commodities are the real reason?

#JustAsking
313 2018-04-14 08:29:51 Can we similarly ascribe each past prez starting with Nixon to having started a war with some or the other nation or ideology. Is it possible that all this is done for the armament industry and also to spook the markets into a free fall as also to make commodities (oil) shoot up?
314 2018-04-14 08:21:17 Then an illiterate has more sense than you. You went to school but the school didn't pass through you, your type bribe their way through school.

Because, you didn't know know government economic policies affect prices of COMMODITIES in the market. Basic SS1 economics. Shame.

349 2018-04-14 01:49:04 Nope, and I am not defending slavery. But slaves were offered by African kingdoms as trade commodities. The British didn't conduct raids themselves, which is what many/most seem to think happened.
350 2018-04-14 01:48:02 Ok. But this tweet seems to refer to slavery, correct? Europeans traded for slaves from African states which were selling slave. It didn't go down with Europeans rounding up Africans. It was Africans capturing other Africans and using them as trade commodities. That's all.
351 2018-04-14 01:45:08 COT data doesn't correlate the same way with all commodities. And, with oil, I've never seen much consistency. I just liked the technical picture of oil and the energy stocks two weeks ago.

353 2018-04-14 01:32:24 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
354 2018-04-14 01:11:08 Eu pensava assim, mas ai descobri que mais da metade das plantações de commodities são destinadas à pecuária, ou seja, aquelas florestas de milho, soja, entre outros, são destinadas à engorda do boi pra ns comer aquele cupim gostoso, mas é o que sei apenas
355 2018-04-14 01:05:26 @jimcramer would you view at $MU differently than the past with the consolidation in the industry? Commodities always seem find a way to over supply at some point in the cycle, but the lack of competitors could temper this process.
356 2018-04-14 00:54:59 Yup that makes sense. More volatility for sure in this space. I think we can finally look for solid trends in resources and commodities. Price and time will tell I guess.

484 2018-04-13 15:20:00 That is not the US’ BoP math bc it can print USD for imports.  My whole point is that as China can increasingly print CNY for oil & other commodities (by far their biggest deficit categories), then suddenly this is no longer China’s BoP math either!!!

578 2018-04-13 06:42:12 Inflation fiat is actually going down over time, not up. It's still at 5% for USD/EUR, but much lower than say 50 years ago.

592 2018-04-13 05:04:40 Devisthan??!! An example of how the argument that Hinduism is perfect for women because we worship goddesses falls flat. Women are commodities. Tools of war. In this case targeted to terrorise an entire nomadic community. I don't understand how ppl still use the goddess argument

594 2018-04-13 04:58:49 it's not a standard text but the fever by Wallace Shawn explains fetishist of commodities better than anywhere I have seen and his Night Thoughts touches on the phases of modes of production and the origins of the state very well
595 2018-04-13 04:56:15 The purchasing power of $USD weakens from this effect and it creates a hyper inflation feedback loop. The marketcap of cryptocurrencies will likely never return to the lows you are mentioning in the same way that commodities will never return to their prices 10 years ago.

598 2018-04-13 04:36:15 Muy buen artículo. ¡Gracias Nadia!

Y si, es un candidato que le habla a su gente, esa que tiene acceso a todos los 'commodities' del capitalismo. 

Felicitó a Macron por su victoria sobre la ultraderecha. En un tuit le contestaron: "Tú eres nuestra ultraderecha".

600 2018-04-13 04:17:55 I see so many unnecessary comparisons of female artists by the twitter gays and not a single post about Charlie Puth vs. Shawn Mendez or Zayn vs. The Weeknd. Women are compared because they are seen as commodities and men get worshipped for their artistry. #bullshit #twittergays
601 2018-04-13 04:10:09 Crypto tokenization is unique, because the smart utility of some of these currencies can be used to trade commodities at a faster pace.

hmm, a fine line of dividing time 
here we parse ideas into manageable dissects 
we ward it, initiate gang structures 
lock down the streets 
and corner desire 
to marketable commodities

now, about pot pies
604 2018-04-13 03:47:49 @Tim_richards_wx not as dumb as yourself since I have a moral compass & care about the USA and not contd propagating communism. Price may go up a little, but will go down in time. Commodities go down in price with mass production. You'd go a long way to respect your elders
605 2018-04-13 03:43:25 You explain Kalyan what is development. Do your location had water for agriculture or not. Power 24 hrs or not. Are the commodities required are being done or not in near by villages. You can share what is required in your area. I know you ever done it.
606 2018-04-13 03:41:01 What about subsistence farming instead of bulk commodities? What about small amounts of higher value added products? What about communal gardens?
607 2018-04-13 03:02:40 Cool.  Funny, I was telling my buddy when I was in UT ~2 weeks ago about a old friend whos dad traded commodities & purchased his older brother a seat in ~'78.  He later went on to be a big wheel a NYME & ICE
608 2018-04-13 02:59:14 He does. All these years they hung on to tradeable commodities. A lot of teams wanted Hamilton a couple years ago but he's never improved hitting. Everything else he's great.
609 2018-04-13 02:47:04 Interesting how access to music and photo storage have become commodities, but there aren’t any platforms that do them particularly well. 

Unfortunate crossroads where there is a need, but no money to be made.

613 2018-04-13 02:10:41 From Oxford => "Market:  A regular gathering of people for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other commodities."  I don't know that you can........?
614 2018-04-13 01:51:39 Unless, the high oil price feeds in and lifts the rest of the commodities complex and nothing really materialises on Syria
615 2018-04-13 01:46:40 Long commodities was my second biggest theme in my 2018 outlook.  I also mentioned this on your podcast on Dec 6, 2017!  No doubt it’s helped in a multi asset portfolio.   Plus it’s providing positive carry in certain commodities.
616 2018-04-13 01:43:20 (4) No seemingly naturally interested commodities audience given how badly folks got burned post-2011 and beyond first in precious metals then oil, so fear it will just happen all over again ...
617 2018-04-13 01:33:28 Do you always feel entitled to the commodities produced by others? 
If I produce something, how much do you think I should be allowed to keep?
618 2018-04-13 01:23:28 I'll repay you with commodities or cash or something else! This is how art works.

620 2018-04-13 01:15:08 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
621 2018-04-13 01:13:45 BTW, my current long term investment strategy is to accumulate heavily anytime BTC hits the cost to mine and starts forming a technical bottom. Works in nearly all commodities markets
622 2018-04-13 01:05:27 I'd guess that in a truly free market it's more likely to see monopolies develop for production of commodities or products with little differentiation.
623 2018-04-13 00:59:42 Thanks for the reply. I've check several large brokers - they trade all commodities except uranium. Tells u something about the mkt.

625 2018-04-13 00:34:08 I appreciate hearing your views @Rod_Phillips - but pushing oil onto rail cars is not the answer - much riskier and also not enough capacity on rail now for other commodities.  The project has deemed in the national interest - BC needs to do it's part!
626 2018-04-13 00:23:20 @business bcom (their index for commodities) is very bullish since last year around September when their golden cross happened. #oil #gold #wti
627 2018-04-13 00:23:03 I quit playing regularly around 2011...

Fishing and commodities dominated my time...
628 2018-04-13 00:20:12 All that Astroturfer nonsense! 

And someone needs to tell HnH that commodities are tradables - our most important ones. Why does no one pick him up on this? Sycophants all 
629 2018-04-13 00:07:16 And the oil is being shipped, now by rail. So other commodities and goods (like grain) is being halted. This non-sensical and illegal blockade is only hurting Canada. Yes, I am in favour of green energy, but until is is more sustainable, this is what we have.

632 2018-04-13 00:03:17 That’s a load of crap. Picks aren’t one year commodities. He played KAT a boatload his second year. Trash argument.
