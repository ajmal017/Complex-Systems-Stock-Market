5 2018-01-31 23:55:37 Like I can only afford to short stocks .25c and up still...to short an .01 stock you have to have an account value of like 500k lol...but still it opens up a whole new world of stocks to short that almost no other brokers have. 20-30% scalps are way easier short than long.

Can I trade future and options of indices like FTSE, S&P and stocks like BP, Barclays and forex pairs through your platform? Also any idea about minimum amount that I require to buy a FTSE contract at todays price and to buy a call option of say £7500.
Many thanks,

60 2018-01-31 23:32:00 If is it that hard to unload stocks and IRA's, how do investors make profit off the market? Why bother investing if it's hard to get at?

66 2018-01-31 23:29:28 As much as I despise this administration, buying tobacco stocks is a pretty weak justification to resign.
67 2018-01-31 23:28:46 OK, that explains the oil companies. What about "average joe" people? Everyone has their personal fortunes tied up in oil company stocks? What's in it for them to buy into the oil company denialism?
68 2018-01-31 23:26:26 They are just cashing out. Stole as much as they could, did as much damage as they could and now running away with their pensions and stocks.
69 2018-01-31 23:26:06 They're both $175 stocks basically.  Ya gotta compare.  I'd rather own $FB and it's growth at a very very reasonable P/E. Best deal in Tech.
70 2018-01-31 23:25:52 $FB $MSFT $PYPL To be clear, I have no positions at this point on any of these stocks. Informational purposes only.
71 2018-01-31 23:23:48 She had a tremendous conflict of interest buying tobacco stocks while running a smoking cessation program as a. Paid government employee. Sad!

73 2018-01-31 23:21:57 Fitzgerald didn't buy any of these stocks directly, but as part of more complex financial instruments she invested in. The odd thing about this story is that she's choosing to resign rather than divest. Trump Effect is a plausible explanation.
74 2018-01-31 23:21:39 I have to ask, what scanners do you run to find these stocks you post.

It's only gained $6.9 trillion since he took office, and US stocks have NOT risen as much as their foreign equivalents.

128 2018-01-31 22:55:06 Well the rich get richer-er and the greed increases and the ethics go away.  A sign of the times.  That’s one of the main reasons that labor unions have existed in the past.  No ethics, no trickle down.  Cabinet members buying tobacco stocks!  Oh my!
129 2018-01-31 22:54:43 Just going to do some insider trading and then 'pump and dump' some penny stocks on unsuspecting patsys
130 2018-01-31 22:54:17 Does any remember last year when stocks plumitted then rose back all in an hour? Proof the market is exploding because they are counting on @realDonaldTrump #POTUS... period. Right considering the stock market jumped from Nov 9 2016 and continues. How blind are they?

150 2018-01-31 22:45:07 Adjusted to inflation 80% of workers have wages less now than they did in 1973. Clinton and Obama stupidly thought all they needed was a bull market with high stocks too.

160 2018-01-31 22:41:40 Has anyone made a chart comparing stock buy-backs since #TrumpTaxScam next to the total of bonuses to employees?  

I bet the bonuses are dwarfed by the billions that go only to those who own stocks. Companies are paying out much more to millionaires than to their employees.

166 2018-01-31 22:39:06 Wow. All the $FB shorts celebrating their winnings just got slammed by the Sandberg reversal.  Options markets should be open AH for stocks on earnings day.
167 2018-01-31 22:38:59 Listen I'm not a stocks doctor but it seems like $FB is always set up for a dip after earnings? Even though it crushed the forecast, still dropping due to user time & overall rev growth...
168 2018-01-31 22:38:38 What's the point of that? In that case, who gets to decide who gets taxed at all? Also, rich people tend to have lots of income in stocks/capital so even without the income cuts, they're much more well off.
169 2018-01-31 22:38:28 some of the people that are in the top own  tiny MC stocks that have had huge pump/dumps, like $ORPN, on no news. Should have had a market cap minimum or evaluate close at EOY.

207 2018-01-31 22:19:47 Very interesting. A few reasons I think they may have done it: 
- more impulsive for people who buy emotionally 
- make it feel more like buying stocks 
- obfuscate fees

256 2018-01-31 21:57:13 Thad, great reporting on this - I've enjoyed it. I wonder if it is easier for readers if you indexed both stocks to 100 starting on deal day and then showed the change from then to now by geometrically linking daily returns for each stock. My 0.02.

270 2018-01-31 21:52:09 GPs and dermatologists generally recommend Cetaphil. I use it, I have acne and sensitive skin. Cetaphil have a brilliant range! I find Chemist Warehouse to be the only retailer that stocks the whole range. P.S. only scrub your skin once a week! You will do more harm than good.
271 2018-01-31 21:51:47 Probably no stream tonight. Got a flat at work, spare doesn’t fit, no-one stocks my tires locally. If it can’t be patched then I’m up shit creek without a paddle.

274 2018-01-31 21:50:20 His charitable trust cannot short stocks.
275 2018-01-31 21:50:19 Because oil stocks will only go up... and selling now makes less money for the fund.
276 2018-01-31 21:50:13 Stocks close slightly higher giving up early gains after Feds announce rising rates.
277 2018-01-31 21:49:51 It's this app called acorns, you invest like how ever much money you want, and it spilts it up between small stocks, big stocks, federal, and something else so it's like multiple things
278 2018-01-31 21:49:28 There is still plenty of time for the stock market to crash. It was built up over 8 years, and we are only a 1/4 way through the Donald's term. Lets see it play out, no? Just out of curiosity, how are your stocks doing?

282 2018-01-31 21:47:53 Aflac raised rates so my Co. got rid of it. Many Companies instead of bonuses gave employees stocks or more to 401k that earns Company more $ as they invest that $ or buy stock & earn more $ and get interest. If employee laid off/fired no stocks or sometimes 401k.

287 2018-01-31 21:43:44 So interesting see this play out. Which will crash first, the world stock markets or fiat currencies? And what actually happens if it's the latter?

Seems like you have to be positioned for both scenarios. Deflation (cash), Inflation and/or Monetary Reset (stocks, gold, crypto?)

289 2018-01-31 21:43:19 Moves in these stocks are sick because nobody splits their stk's any more.  In fact Dow Jones suggested $BA split its stock to curt volatility.  We can have a 1000 pt down day w/ a snap of a finger.  $AMZN $GOOG can't be added.  $AAPL was added after split.  @MelissaLeeCNBC
290 2018-01-31 21:42:57 My stocks have been generating great returns for years now. I haven't noticed any changes since Trump signed his tax plan - granted it's only been a month. Trumpers seem to believe everything magically became better just because he became Prez.
291 2018-01-31 21:42:53 End of month dumb money 401k and bonus payout allocations to stocks.
292 2018-01-31 21:42:40 Love most of the stocks you follow Nicholas but i took a small loss on this over today and moving on. Good luck to those still in it though :)
293 2018-01-31 21:42:22 I do not know why that is so important almost every body owns Tobaco stocks in the pension  plans
294 2018-01-31 21:42:09 They own stocks =companies we have given money forever=Golden parachute! Great retirement! What more could you want AS OTHERS GET POORER THANKS TO YOU!
295 2018-01-31 21:41:49 Tobacco stocks are always a "good" investment but having smoked for 10 years starting at 13, I know it's unconscionable to make money off a business model that promotes addiction in kids  who will face a lifetime of medical problems.  Here or anywhere in the world.
296 2018-01-31 21:41:04 Actually Bush started that too. Haha. Obama strangled our economy and optimism. Thats why stocks shot up the moment Trump was elected and the economy picked up after he got rid of all the liberal regulations and is now picking up even more with tax cuts. Even liberal ceo's agree.
297 2018-01-31 21:40:53 It was a roller coaster day for stocks
298 2018-01-31 21:40:41 I don't, and that's why ^ 
Shorting penny stocks either
299 2018-01-31 21:40:41 This means in reality, is, prices going up for average Americans, while the billionaires are getting richer from stocks.

2. When was the last time you got humiliated?
3. What happened when you broke up with your ex?

320 2018-01-31 21:31:14 I noticed as well that slippage plays a big role following swat, especially on stocks as bid/ask is much wider then spy. Sometimes the bid/ask on his pick is so wide, almost 20%, == stop size he recommends. Not hating, just observing

324 2018-01-31 21:29:50 Yeah. $42 billion market cap for a company that treats 1 disease with only 50,000 accessible patients. This is one of the most overpriced stocks in the entire biotech industry. Wait until Trump crushes drug prices too.
325 2018-01-31 21:29:21 Interesting to see how China Fintech sector is growing so fast people dont believe it. Investors are selling stocks in the sector they should be buying here hand over fist. Reminds of $BABA $WUBA $YY etc last year when nobody was buying, then everyone clamoring later

341 2018-01-31 21:23:52 Am I the only one who finds Kevin O’Leary annoying. He acts like he invented investing in stocks. Truth be told he said buy Samsung over AAPL when AAPL was in the 90’s, he also shorted financials 9 mons ago ( how’s the working out). Less is more with that guy.
342 2018-01-31 21:23:46 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $F, and $MU.
343 2018-01-31 21:23:20 $ACWI with new all-time monthly closing highs 11 out of the past 12 months, including the past 7 months in a row. I would argue that is evidence of an uptrend, not a downtrend for stocks around the world

347 2018-01-31 21:21:43 Also worth excluding utilities/infra stocks as their cashflows tend to be stable.
348 2018-01-31 21:21:37 Greenspan popped his own bubble with his 'irrational exuberance' speech. Not satisfied with one bubble, now he's out to pop the ugly Bernanke/Yellen bastard-child bubble with his 'stocks are overvalued' comments. He must be short the market. What other explanation could there be?

362 2018-01-31 21:18:31 I played a fighting game for the first time in a while the other day and guess what.  I’m still meter challenged.  I sat on 5 stocks of meter with Kyo in KoF 98 and absolutely forgot that I had meter to do...whatever with.
363 2018-01-31 21:18:28 why???
364 2018-01-31 21:18:16 That's why the last 18 months has been blurry and stocks for distilleries are up.
365 2018-01-31 21:16:34 It’s almost as if er is already priced into stocks- aside from a few exceptions , BA, EA

367 2018-01-31 21:16:14 We got raises this month too and due to the tax cuts we will be getting another raise in April as well as addition stocks and finally getting sick pay and personal days! So yeah I’m pretty stoked
368 2018-01-31 21:15:45 @CNBCFastMoney @timseymour Arent the valuations sort of nose-bleed for $FB $MSFT as w/much of large cap tech? I understand these managers already OWN them but do you buy these stocks at these highs? It's just not in my investment/trading dna.  I need lower valuations w/growth
369 2018-01-31 21:15:17 Stocks: Over longer periods, the line that resembles a ride on a roller coaster morphs into a gently rising upward slope.
370 2018-01-31 21:15:13 I’m pretty sure a team of like 4 people are responsible for Stocks, Calculator, Compass and Voice Memos.

373 2018-01-31 21:14:33 Stocks mixed: S&P 500 +.05%; Europe -.2%. A perhaps "dead cat" bounce aborted by investor reaction to mixed FED message. Rest of week crucial. More down days likely to encourage bargain hunters to wait for a 5% drop. Strong rebound will encourage buying by those who missed out

379 2018-01-31 21:13:44 Headlines looking pretty good from $FB, $T, etc...that stocks are down says that we've run too far. Wouldn't shock me to see $AMZN get smoked for $100 or more tmrw regardless of their report.

384 2018-01-31 21:09:29 Stocks fade after early rally. Major indexes up slightly after Tues. slump, as buyers stay cautious. More health care losses offset by gains in financials, techs.

S&P and Nasdaq +0.1%

388 2018-01-31 21:08:45 U.S. Stocks on Weds closes about 70 points higher, capping off best month since March 2016
Major indexes briefly turned negative after Federal Reserve gave upgraded assessment of economy.

Stocks rebounded from a sharp two-day sell-off, helped by stronger-than-expected earnings.

395 2018-01-31 21:08:36 plus now we get the "stocks rise after State of the Union" articles, so its a win all around
396 2018-01-31 21:08:08 James, you gave me a question I can't answer, because I don't do price prediction. As far as I am concerned POT stocks as a group currently are not in my buy range - they are still too high for my taste. I am a TA guy. I buy/sell purely baseing on my charts.

399 2018-01-31 21:07:00 Despite the "pullback" yesterday, the #DowJones still posted its best month since March 2016. Up over 5.5%. What a start to 2018. #Stocks

402 2018-01-31 21:05:46 Stocks on watch for a bounce are $ARDM (Potential buyout candidate) and $SMRT. They are continuing to bleed meaning #shorts are going 2 look 2 cover. This along with buying volume could trigger a short squeeze and big spike. Continue to watch.

403 2018-01-31 21:05:18 Stocks recover a bit. The Dow closed at 26,149.46, up 72.57 (+0.28%). Nasdaq +0.12%. S&P +0.05%.

412 2018-01-31 21:01:04 Earnings were great for Raytheon.  Stock price is currently up today.  Whether their toys work or not is not the issue.  Why MIC stocks are such a great investment.  They were great under Bush, Obama, and now Trump!  To the Moon!!!
413 2018-01-31 21:00:53 So the headline of FBN is "stocks erase losses into the close". Were they asleep before noon? #smh

430 2018-01-31 20:59:57 What's so difficult about selling stock, even foreign stocks not traded on US exchanges? (I'd love to see her annual FinCen filing). What exactly are the "complex financial interests" that can't be divested in a timely manner?

432 2018-01-31 20:59:20 It also produces over fishing and open seas hijacking of fish stocks - something neither the United States, nor Canada, are currently (nor in the foreseeable future) prepared to address.  Russia maybe is, but gunboat fisheries management wouldn't be helpful.
433 2018-01-31 20:58:50 Thanks for buying a lot of stocks 
434 2018-01-31 20:58:31 It's back above 10k.   That's a 943.33% increase over a year.  Terrible investment.  :)

But, like most people who made money on BC, we pulled it out and put it in stocks when more was to be made there.
435 2018-01-31 20:58:20 I know where there’s a village with stocks outside a pub. Could make great afternoon entertainment. Bring your own tomatoes.
436 2018-01-31 20:57:37 @waynelapierrejr Stop using my money to support and promote gun control as you're currently  doing with the "Bump Stocks". Not one more penny! #2ndAmendment #2A #Liberty
437 2018-01-31 20:57:13 Also, talking to a financial advisor about ETFs (long term stocks) is a good idea too. You don’t need to tell them your business, just say you’re a freelance consultant (which is true!) 
438 2018-01-31 20:57:12 sometimes a rally will give you a day to get out and still feel on top. i think today was one of those days for cannabis stocks $WEED $ACB
439 2018-01-31 20:56:54 This week is so ass bruh like the only good thing I had left was my stocks and now I’ve lost 21% of my net value JUST TODAY. Fuck it
440 2018-01-31 20:56:42 No, Bitcoin is NOT worthless. This is the same extreme volatility that occurred with thinly-held 'Internet stocks' in the late 90s, except that here there are more big investment institutions (round the world) getting in. They manipulate price to scare away small fry. Works, too!
441 2018-01-31 20:56:15 really? wow. I bet that will make all Americans forget about how his accomplishments are breaking historical records in everything from economic growth, tax cuts, stocks, unemployment.. silly me. i was excited about being able to hire 10 more people for my business.
442 2018-01-31 20:56:02 #Amazon & #WarrenBuffett looking 2 start a not-for-profit healthcare/insurance initiative. Just the thought of this happening sent #healthcare based stocks lower. Profit margins & loyalty 2 share holders as opposed 2 patients r what drives up healthcare costs, nothing else.
443 2018-01-31 20:55:46 I have another conspiracy theory that beats theirs... Trump set it up to give himself a "unifying" event. 

I said it last week, but now I mean it.  It is time to invest in tinfoil stocks.
444 2018-01-31 20:55:30 Us too - mum had to replenish the stocks yesterday!!

450 2018-01-31 20:52:19 $UNH $CI and $ANTM are all great bullish stocks that are low right now. I'd wait a bit, if the news about it gets more public it can cause a pullback from investors and push the prices a bit lower
451 2018-01-31 20:52:15 It's all OK with Trump.  Except tobacco stocks. Tobacco stocks seem too offend Trumps delicate sensibilities - all other *things that will kill you" are still on the table.

453 2018-01-31 20:51:38 Apple has forced me to tweet.  Needs are not being met for children and seniors.  The aging demographic needs basic devices.  My 3 devices do not talk to each other and keep trying to sign me up for Apple Pay which   I will never use.  Stocks will reflect frustration.

455 2018-01-31 20:50:56 There are some lovely people who do things for this cause out there.  We use the 4luis boxes. They do age and gender specific. We have stocks of them in Paediatrics, ED and NNU along with advice leaflets for the families

458 2018-01-31 20:49:34 P/E ratios have been growing since 2012, getting fairly high compared to other high-earnings times. It's not at all impossible that stocks are in a bubble.
459 2018-01-31 20:46:59 Water off a ducks back I suspect! Put them in the stocks I say and throw rotten fruit!
460 2018-01-31 20:46:26 I’m glad your stocks are doing well!  Also, the president jokes, so why can’t I?
461 2018-01-31 20:45:59 But the main purpose for the PEG Watchlist is to keep you focused on the stocks and/or sectors that are delivering the strong earnings and showing consistent growth.

All I see is propagandist political bullshit and by ignorant "#paidtobeon" pumping a damn liberal agenda
Sad u could stop tat
464 2018-01-31 20:45:03 I'm thankful to @RedLeafSec for providing lists of stocks to NOT get involved with.
465 2018-01-31 20:43:18 I kind of thought it was a shake out - TLT was going up and GS was dropping, meaning the interest rates were dropping, which tech stocks love
466 2018-01-31 20:42:56 Agreed. Fed risks causing the very thing they are trying to prepare for, but they are preparing for it by trying to raise rates and need inflation to do that. Only way to get there is weaker dollar, higher oil, higher stocks imho.
467 2018-01-31 20:42:45 That down move after the Fed my friends was a shake off. The tell was rising TLT - tech stocks LOVE low rates
468 2018-01-31 20:42:34 Economy depends on all investors not listening to fake hype news and instead focus on making good decisions and purchasing stocks that have a long-term future as well as short-term
469 2018-01-31 20:42:25 Donald Rumsfeld held Pharma stocks throughout his term as Sec of Def. Cheney never disclosed his financial stuff nor divested during the GWBush years.
470 2018-01-31 20:42:15 So, how about that CDC person resigning after it was discovered they bought tobacco stocks?
471 2018-01-31 20:41:54 Like my buddy @IncredibleTrade says .. when market is fading find the stocks that are green and buy them .. shows strength in those names !!!

475 2018-01-31 20:40:58 in 2016, with #Gold near $1,350, mining stocks were the darlings of Wall Street, February, into early March, then, after #Brexit. 2018, with #Gold nearing $1,350 again, 70% of miners have YET to get back to August 2016 levels. There's NO support.
476 2018-01-31 20:40:54 Except when it's not a near zero sum game with steady markets but a rising tide flooding all risk asset classes: stocks, bonds, real estate, personal and corporate credit, and yes, criptos.
477 2018-01-31 20:40:28 Ummm, not in more stocks?

490 2018-01-31 20:34:24 Say your conspiracy theory is correct how does that effect GDP growth or the unemployment rate?? So companies buying back their own stocks are responsible for the lowest unemployment rate ever recorder for blacks in the US. Is that really what you are trying to say?? 
491 2018-01-31 20:33:46 $CPTO.CA from the pre-market newsletter hit up as high as 85%, $SKLN from an early chat call 38% & $MNKD chat mention with a 12% move. Didn't take the first on a 6% gap up & sold the other two way too early. Same story as yesterday, great ideas with so much $ left behind. #Stocks

552 2018-01-31 20:29:45 Firstly, are you afraid to lose? If you are then you must conquer this fear. I recommend buying random, but liquid, stocks putting a stoploss 2% below your purchase and just letting the market take you out. You will most likely break even doing this.
553 2018-01-31 20:28:11 yeah ... I was being a bit of a smart ass. I'd like to see a more parabolic move higher to trigger the same speculative juices in stocks that existed in bitcoin a couple months ago.

578 2018-01-31 20:20:01 I have noticed that stocks have their own personality and behavior, which is why I tend to day trade the same names over and over. None of them hold to this perfectly, but enough that I can get in and get out at certain relatively predictable levels. $AAPL $FB $NFLX $JPM $GS
579 2018-01-31 20:18:50 Made some portfolio changes. Holdings are: ENR still at top along with INTC, T, BGS, FLO, GE, LAND. 7 stocks & a +1, HEAR. Same objectives.
580 2018-01-31 20:18:41 $NFLX Netflix support is at the 50-day weighted moving average of $219. Long way down!  If you have a killer profit, sell & take it. #stocks
581 2018-01-31 20:18:40 As well as it's not known how many stocks each of the companies have and it's just really silly to tell things like "SM gets money BH's" 
Maybe the difference between percentage of owned stocks is really small
582 2018-01-31 20:17:31 A spread thing?  WTI rising, less crac margin for +$ crudes.  LLS is premium, so reduced Capline pull from Cush.  From Cush, same thing, with Diamond +draw of -$ Bakken.  LLS backing up, so drop price. Cush uncorked by Diamond,  w - from Capline, so stocks dropping. No proof.

617 2018-01-31 20:08:45 Still think a bunch of stocks look fine and any market pullback could create some nice opportunities in early-stage stocks. That said, the advance had been narrowing and now we're seeing sellers make a stand.
618 2018-01-31 20:08:35 As an example... one way to implement is to take an equal portion of your B&H stocks and B&H bonds and flip that 100% stocks or bonds based on trend. Helps to not own bonds strategically as much / more as to avoid stock drawdowns.
619 2018-01-31 20:08:17 Tax reform is putting $300-$400 more per month in my budget. Plus I'm now eligible for the Child Tax Credit. And my stocks are up. If President Trump can claim credit for all this he'll have a chance at reelection.

621 2018-01-31 20:07:03 It has a similar risk profile as a 60/40 (from a vol standpoint) and to me is a diverse allocation from a timing standpoint vs a 60/40 that is diverse from an asset allocation standpoint. So... I like it as a portfolio carve out to flips between stocks / bonds on margin.

629 2018-01-31 20:04:50 ETF's aren't so bad they're actually quite similar to mutual funds but picking individual stocks can get dicey and it's not exactly following Dave's method for diversifying
630 2018-01-31 20:04:25 One reason why I think trend following is a much better allocation carved out from a broad asset allocation (like 60/40) vs stocks. I’m guessing you didn’t read my post at the top of this thread?

668 2018-01-31 19:51:52 Last week bond bear market 'began' due to rising rates. This week stocks tank. Why? Rising rates. Now Greenspan says bubble in stocks AND bonds. So basically, you can't invest. Yet being in cash for more than millisecond is WORST strategy. If youre not a Wall St algo, good luck.
669 2018-01-31 19:51:50 you do realise that company CEOs sell their stocks very regularly... or you have zero idea of how the stock market works... and think youre an expert on markets because you have a couple crypto holdings...?

689 2018-01-31 19:47:11 The market is only "rational" in that central banks have manipulated rates and stocks (hello JCB and SNB) for so long, people assume that it can go on forever.

691 2018-01-31 19:46:38 I never said it wasn’t, clearly everything dealing with stocks constantly changes. I’m just saying all the people who saw that people were making money on bitcoin then went out and bought a tenth of a bitcoin and act like they know everything about crypto currencies are retarded.
692 2018-01-31 19:46:04 It looks like we do stock this magazine, but it is dependant on the store. If your local store no longer stocks it, they may be able to order it in for you if you ask at the till. Regards, Gill

695 2018-01-31 19:44:48 JYP has more profit now than YG in stocks that are bought by people at each comeback..YG did not have comebacks regularly that's why JYP overcame him but for YG that money it's nothing compared to the money coming from other sources

698 2018-01-31 19:43:16 après le problème c'est quand on voit que c'est même pas de l'occasion de particuliers ces prix là, on trouve ça en neuf sur les marketplace de la part de soit disant libraire pro, ils voient que c'est plus imprimé ils vendent leurs derniers stocks a des prix totalement abusif.
699 2018-01-31 19:42:59 Ok fine, then I will say I was wrong the last 5 years. Now to prove yourself, you tell me EXACTLY when to short US stocks (S&P, Nas, Dow) numbers hit, and then EXACTLY what numbers to buy those indexes back at.
700 2018-01-31 19:42:29 unemployment down, stocks rocketing up, taxes down, Americans getting bonus' - many for the first time ever (me), ISIS is crushed, veterans are getting taken care of properly. all this in his first year. tell me again how he doesn't know what hes doing?

704 2018-01-31 19:41:26 Lol. Just stocks. YG still is more successful than JYP. Stocks fluctuate a lot. YG has many sub labels too. And their artists earn much more too, with their artists taking 60% of the profit. Just because Forbes wrote something and you read it doesn't mean you know everything.
705 2018-01-31 19:41:22 O THIS IS A GREAT IDEA! nobody ever thought of investing all their riches they don't have & parents never had in stocks & mutual funds they can't afford because they don't have the wealth for that nor to avoid debt nor to get an education without its commensurate hellacious debt
706 2018-01-31 19:41:10 So bitcoin is a 'bubble' because it's price is volatile and uncorrelated to other investments?  The market not knowing how to price bitcoin doesn't imply it's necessarily overvalued.  And many would argue that the lack of correlation with stocks/usd/real estate is a GOOD THING.
707 2018-01-31 19:40:27 Tobacco stocks?  Who cares?  Can't own stock in fast food or soft drinks either? Left wanted her out.  And W's ethics lawyer chiming in about ethics is prob the biggest joke of all

715 2018-01-31 19:38:20 Of course he said it then tried to fix the underlying issue.  Republicans say it and then vote to make bump stocks available.  Cry me a river.
716 2018-01-31 19:37:49 No!!!  I'm thinking we are going to see a headline when it doesn't tie out, "All 30 Dow stocks were down over 1% today yet the index managed to eeeek out a 5bp gain on the day"

722 2018-01-31 19:35:24 Traded biotech stocks know you don’t use physical stops near a FDA decision. Market takes out stops halts trading and often the stock reopens much higher than where you stopped out & you get robbed. Got to use verbal orders in highly volatile biotech stocks.

730 2018-01-31 19:32:16 Police arresting at a disproportionate rate is the main reason.

Meanwhile, white males are behind nearly all terrorist attacks in the United States and no changes have been made whatsoever to prevent these tragedies. 

The latest has been making sure bump stocks are still legal.
731 2018-01-31 19:32:07 With the market looking choppy most trades should be considered as day trades since most stocks aren't holding gains. Protect your capital!

764 2018-01-31 19:24:50 She was a known quantity. She held the same positions (and the stocks) as top health administrator in GA. Jet set Tom Price and Slimy Newt Gingrich championed her. GOP turned blind eye during confirmation.

766 2018-01-31 19:24:23 IMHO, PE is a right metric for stable or growing earnings, these earnings are ephemeral. Even then, if these earnings continue for a few quarters, the stocks should reach higher.

796 2018-01-31 19:13:51 Thanks @fayfeeney.  It's nothing short of bewildering how many small-cap tech and life science companies in particular fail this test, and then wonder why their stocks never trade.  Systemically deficient storytelling...

814 2018-01-31 19:06:46 still basically a hobby. The % of people who trade or HODL it is tiny and the total market cap is still a joke compared to gold, stocks, stock derivatives, etc.

This is how stocks are: huge barriers to entry. But crypto is in price discovery mode with almost zero barriers to entry.

883 2018-01-31 18:40:54 It's a simpliste argument. I would say the same about stock market. Why would someone buy stocks (gas, silver, pieces of companies/houses they never set the foot in, etc, ) that they will never use? Can you give the answer or is it too complicated??
884 2018-01-31 18:40:30 I think about my father in law that bought $SPX at 1800 and is 77 years old. He said he would dump all equities at X% but did not give me a number.

918 2018-01-31 18:22:33 Agree.  Spreads do not seem to be reflecting out of season demand levels.  Was a gasoline build to work off, but levels hardly worrying.  In fact IF demand remains above expectations, stocks could prove low.

924 2018-01-31 18:19:45 It's great fun to own #stocks. It's painful to follow the #charts. Business and dividends instead of watching the ticker tape. #money
925 2018-01-31 18:19:38 Indeed @staazbuck - #Israel's successful graduation from #EM to #DM & @OECD ascension is a positive example for #economic development & #technological #innovation - now #Investors are starting to rediscover #Israeli Stocks and the #ETFs that provide exposure to Israel
926 2018-01-31 18:19:33 How do I buy stocks though
927 2018-01-31 18:19:27 I think that's the key - if UK consumer muddles through then Stocks like #SCS should be OK - they seem better managed than #CPR  by a long way.
928 2018-01-31 18:18:42 Don't bury your head in crypto, understand its important to understand macro finance.

Stocks, bonds, and precious metals are all important to watch and observe if any correlations are present.

Watch the dow industrial and US 10Y bonds today.
929 2018-01-31 18:18:35 thankfully NGDP and bond yields don't matter to stocks, so no one cares.. ;p

932 2018-01-31 18:17:10 So I am excited to have Daimind on the Sky but I hope Coach Stocks has a conversation with her to make sure she is willing to be apart of Chicago's future. Don't want another EDD situation. For the #4 pick, I rather have Victoria Vivians, she's 6 ft  guard
933 2018-01-31 18:16:54 "I #invest in #cryptocurrency and not #stocks because volatility and predictions depend on the state of illegal child trade in third world countries as opposed to shit @realDonaldTrump says on Twitter."

935 2018-01-31 18:16:40 Yet another #Trump appointee resigning.

They're all corrupt and unqualified.

RT @ASlavitt: BREAKING: Director of #CDC is resigning after caught buying tobacco stocks.

This is the right decision.
936 2018-01-31 18:16:36 Have your own trade plans and make your own decisions.  If you are trading stocks off of tweets you should not be trading with real money
937 2018-01-31 18:16:06 Spoiler alert: penny stocks aren't worth just a penny either.
938 2018-01-31 18:15:53 They get rid of the stocks that go down....like GE
939 2018-01-31 18:15:37 It's important we don't equate "activity"with profitability. #stocks
940 2018-01-31 18:15:20 $DFCO CSTI large block at ask slowing it a little bit!
941 2018-01-31 18:14:31 Darn straight we are! I live on $1046 per month in SS and need help all the way around! A second income or SNAP and utility assistance! The illegals are taking what I and millions of other Americans need desperately! No 401k, stocks, bonds or anything! We are still forgotten!
942 2018-01-31 18:14:26 For anyone who hasn’t joined the site yet or isn’t active in the chats, @SUNNYLAND24 releases watch lists throughout the week of different stocks to keep an eye on. Be sure to take advantage of everything that is offered  #investing #stocks #StockMarketInsights $BYOC $ANDI
943 2018-01-31 18:13:57 True, although those shares are often presold as shorts and then covered when the shares become available.  That is why many stocks aren't affected much by free trading shares.
944 2018-01-31 18:13:16 If I were Bezos, Buffett, and Dimon I would get short Healthcare stocks, THEN announce that We're bringing in Oprah on the deal too! #NailInTheCoffin
945 2018-01-31 18:13:15 Only 54% of americans own stocks, and 10% own 84% of them. We're looking at 46% of the bottom that don't directly benefit as shareholders. Increased profit margins go to buybacks and shareholders (the top half) profit. I'm probably low middle class, benefitting a little, sure.
946 2018-01-31 18:13:05 Crypto trading is not like penny stocks. There is a real need for decentralization. Our society has evolved to a point where most of us have reached a certain awareness, and we are no longer easily manipulated by governments and media.
947 2018-01-31 18:11:50 Good luck for the future @_OlivierGiroud_ . Sorry to see you go. #NaNaNaNaa
948 2018-01-31 18:11:11 Ha ha!! The head of the CDC had to resign because she bought stocks in tobacco companies after assuming the position. What’s next, the director of the DEA being a high ranking member in a Mexican cartel.
949 2018-01-31 18:11:08 Examples are ,Insulin , Amlodioine, Glimipiride 2 Mg etc these are Daily usable drugs and almost 60 %  of the diabetes patients needs this . Request to speak to @AnanthKumar_BJP sir and help us to get medicines stocks. Then I will gurentee the sales will be 3 times more.
950 2018-01-31 18:11:01 It’s sickening to know our lives are being played with so their stocks and earnings go up. F@CK THEM!!!! I care less about them than they do about me. I hope they’re exposed and people get to witness what gigantic piles of human garbage they are.
951 2018-01-31 18:10:48 #Liar What you stated here couldn't be further from the truth! Finally a @POTUS who believes in America & wants best for ALL Americans!  Bringing back jobs by cutting regs higher pay wages bonuses stocks & 401ks! What have YOU done for us in 8yrs NOTHING that will burn in my eyes
952 2018-01-31 18:10:30 Hi Lenny, I don't invest / hold any of these stocks long term, they are simply vehicles for day trading momentum, so I don't have a long term outlook on most of them. Thanks for reaching out!
953 2018-01-31 18:09:08 Him or Brees with that defense I’m buying all the stocks lol
954 2018-01-31 18:08:50 Att kunna ändra sin inställning till ett bolag på grund av positiv/negativ fundamental information tycker jag tyder på ett sunt tänk. Man får vara aktsam så man inte slutar ta till sig ny information endast för man äger bolaget eller liknande.
955 2018-01-31 18:08:43 @allstarcharts Can you do some fibonacci analysis on the Canadian MJ stocks?  WEED, APH, ACB, etc?
956 2018-01-31 18:08:43 ‘She had stock in five other tobacco companies including Reynolds American, British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands, Philip Morris International and Altria Group, Inc., as well as a number of pharmaceutical stocks which she subsequently sold as part of her ethics agreement.’
957 2018-01-31 18:08:28 Investing ya money in some stocks now is the type shit I’m on so the future can be legit comfortable and stable.
958 2018-01-31 18:08:04 Possibly. It’s just odd to hear the president and the media raving about the economy & jobs, yet not see it reflected in real life. Other than for a couple people I know with stocks.  Must be in certain areas or upper income brackets.
959 2018-01-31 18:07:56 #Stocks higher ahead of #Fed announcement on #economy and #interestrates #Dow UP 151 to 26,228 Updates @KNX1070 @CBSLA @MottekOnMoney
960 2018-01-31 18:07:38 My stocks did a puke and rally this week
961 2018-01-31 18:07:17 Lot of talk of $GE potentially being dropped from the $DIA.

Remember, by executive order, we can only have stocks that go parabolic represented while representing so much winning
962 2018-01-31 18:06:12 Who all on my friends list got investment in the stock market name some good stocks to invest in

964 2018-01-31 18:05:25 She probably has no clue what stocks she is invested in. I am sure she uses a financial advisor like Meryl Lynch or Charles Shwab.  Ridiculous
965 2018-01-31 18:05:17 Everybody looks at our stock of debt and says isn't that terrible we're bankrupt! For some strange reason they then fail to look at the asset side and merrily confuse stocks and flows. It is very annoying.
966 2018-01-31 18:05:07 If only she had bought stocks of companies the provide life killing abortion services, or pot stocks nobody would have cared.  Congress can trade on insider information, and no one cares.  If she isn’t selling loosies at the local school, she should stay. @cdcdirector
967 2018-01-31 18:04:10 You can take calls all day and talk about stocks
968 2018-01-31 18:04:05 The director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention investing and profiting from tobacco company stocks?! *45 and his continuing parade of greed and incompetence, you can't make this stuff up.#IncompetenceAndCorruption #NotMyPresident
969 2018-01-31 18:03:26 And the woman running the CDC was buying tobacco stocks. They were all hand picked to run their departments into the ground so the GOP could finally prove how terrible the government is.

972 2018-01-31 18:02:41 Fed Chair Yellen leaves her post after four years, and during that time it was smooth sailing for stocks, with tech…
973 2018-01-31 18:01:52 Sounds bad, but I'd like to know details. If you're in broadly diversified index funds (like the Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund), you own tobacco stocks by default, which is one thing. If she was stock-picking, and chose unique tobacco companies, that's another thing entirely.
974 2018-01-31 18:01:43 @ReformedBroker LOL: Headline: Investment community realizes people need to always buy new shoes, shoe stocks soar

982 2018-01-31 17:58:20 Why is the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump so obsessed with the economy? Domestic terrorist running around. Healthcare prices skyrocketing. Massive income inequality. Massive racial tensions. But hey rich peoples stocks are doing well so thats something right?
983 2018-01-31 17:58:08 Doesn't look like it. #Steel stocks showing same pattern as the Airlines. It is already decided the entire sector is a Sell ahead of ER. ALL going lower no matter what.
984 2018-01-31 17:57:57 @warrior16win frank who do you use to trade otc stocks?
985 2018-01-31 17:57:55 You don't buy tobacco stocks when you're the head of the CDC! It should have been a no-brainer. And you don't buy pharmaceutical stocks, either.
986 2018-01-31 17:57:35 I'm still working out other stocks on the ground and in the air, but for now those are the ones I prioritize to absorb first.
987 2018-01-31 17:56:11 Why is the @GOP so obsessed with the economy? Domestic terroist running around. Healthcare prices skyrocketing. But hey rich peoples stocks are doing well so thats something right?
988 2018-01-31 17:56:06 Don’t let these traders get out of focus. Pot stocks are trending up! Look at a longer term chart. Nothing but up up up.  Short sighted traders make peanuts while Canadian longs get filthy rich. See where your pot stocks are come 2019 while they cry from sidelines
989 2018-01-31 17:55:51 Somehow, the fact that the previous CDC head stepped down due to her involvement with Tobacco stocks is not unrelated.

Trump is literally hiring the worst people possible to head these agencies, precisely to undermine them.
990 2018-01-31 17:55:41 What was she thinking? Tobacco stocks of all things?! It is formally called the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Did she miss that part?
991 2018-01-31 17:55:23 ...there is a line from A Knights Tale that comes to mind, when Ledger was in the stocks and Prince Edward comes to free him...

997 2018-01-31 17:53:29 $zsan buying stocks is about risk/reward - not luck. If a 14mil MC company is about 2 do a 2ndary 4 up 57 mil (w/over allotment) odds r it’s going down-not up - think product is decent w/strong IP but on sidelines till 2ndary over
998 2018-01-31 17:52:37 Sure. Yea right. Who are they talking to ?Give us a break. He's speech was hardly unifying or uplifting. Stocks should react to his Mexicans are in gangs and killers, a Nazi oversight of Federal employees, no sanctions on Russia, healthcare screwed,

1006 2018-01-31 17:50:32 don't know about you but the 15% I got in 2017 on my $5k investment didn't greatly effect my purchasing power. Much like regressive taxes disproportionately effect the poor, stock increases disproportionately advantage the wealthy. Stocks alone don't indicate overall success
1007 2018-01-31 17:49:49 401k's are earning back previous losses. hope all those that have 401k's take the earnings out of stocks before the earnings are lost again.
1008 2018-01-31 17:49:49 And drug stocks, even more damning.
1009 2018-01-31 17:49:46 Lowered taxes, brought companies back to America, made incentives for companies to invest in the US...in turn making stocks soar...reforming immigration, investing in our military while carrying out operations in the middle east to cut down ISIS...do I need to keep going?

Hey as long as it wasn't in @UmbrellaCorp
1016 2018-01-31 17:46:36 Really wish I had bought some health stocks yesterday. Great opportunity to get a discount.
1017 2018-01-31 17:46:33 Now that's funny. We've watched this nation be run by government, like a government, straight into debt that can't be paid down. Stocks go up. Businesses coming back. Stopped paying the UN to spend our tax dollars on terrorist. THAT'S WINNING
1018 2018-01-31 17:45:58 50% of the Americans that chose to take responsibility for their future  have a 401K which is primarily the Stock Market.  A lot of Americans also use the stock option where they work and some just buy stocks.   This is why working Americans are loving the current stock market.

1020 2018-01-31 17:44:46 Feel this is the best time to take corrected quality mid and small cap stocks which are having margin of safety.
Trick - if you catch a 50% corrected stock then the return you get is 100% when it reaches to normal price.

1029 2018-01-31 17:41:30 Wait, back up, the head of the CDC has tobacco stocks? Pharmaceutical stocks? Nope, nothing to see here, 
1030 2018-01-31 17:40:53 Also my husband and I, gross $37,000 a year. But after all the bills are paid including the house payment, we are left with 16,000 to spend. So we don't have stocks, and we have no 401k. Have you ever had to live on $16,000 a year?
1031 2018-01-31 17:40:35 So why was the CDC Director buying and selling tobacco and drug stocks? Drain the swamp. Drain the swamp my alligator.
1032 2018-01-31 17:40:06 Being forced to resign as director of the CDC for BUYING TOBACCO STOCKS while in office? That’s all? Revoking her medical license would be a good next step. In any case, would YOU trust a doctor with judgment - even for mere self-preservation - as poor as hers?
1033 2018-01-31 17:39:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.

1039 2018-01-31 17:37:33 Trump inherited a vital economy with low unemployment, soaring stocks and millions more people receiving healthcare under Obamacare..It is not perfect but is successful,not the failure Trump and Reps report.Altho with constant sabotage,not for long.Which is really sad

1046 2018-01-31 17:35:00 CDC Director finally resigns. One too many scandals huh? First you accept millions from Coca Cola to aid in your campaign against childhood obesity. THEN you buy tobacco stocks and pursue anti-smoking initiatives. Ethical misconduct at its finest lol

1101 2018-01-31 17:16:51 And a CDC Director who invested in cigarette stocks as she administered anti-smoking campaign? Or a Commerce Secretary who's ships carry oil for Russian firm owned by Putin's daughter? Rule ... of ... Law!

1170 2018-01-31 16:58:08 Still a "sell and fill" theme in #ZN_F. Brief 17bid, and quickly down to a new 13 low. USDJPY helping the downside. We still don't care about slipping stocks, which has been a running gag in UST. Curious if buyers who absorbed the 14 seller volume will get itchy if we break 13.
1171 2018-01-31 16:58:00 Yo guys @JabongIndia I really like y'all but why all this daily pricing difference? Y'all selling consumer apparels or stocks?!? Why don't y'all start an F&O thing while you're at it, so at least I can play arbitrage!! #ecommerce
1172 2018-01-31 16:57:58 The are all pigs at the slop bucket. Following the King Pig .  A Dr and tobacco stocks purchased after she takes over CDC takes it to another level. Trump will declare her a hero and patriot.

1175 2018-01-31 16:57:45 I've been thinking about transitions in big consumer apps a lot for the past few months. If you're the owner of a major platform like Android and iOS, you have the luxury to make multiple apps that can do one thing well. iOS - Clock, Stocks, Notes. Google - Youtube, Keep, Inbox.
1176 2018-01-31 16:57:33 US stocks rebound strongly on solid earnings..
1177 2018-01-31 16:57:30 Well, we know ethics means nothing right now AND the stocks she bought would have benefited from the regs being removed by this admin (that she would have input on)
1178 2018-01-31 16:57:19 Your graph is even more cherry picked. Mar 2009 right after the housing market crash when stocks were dropped. Of course they go back up afterwards.
1179 2018-01-31 16:57:19 You’re right. The agenda is to resist but large majority have no clue what they are resisting! Stocks rising, more $$ of their paychecks. Safer cities! Yea reasonable people don’t resist these policies!

1195 2018-01-31 16:52:18 I'm saying they matter very little to the actual financial health of the majority of Americans. And even if you do own stocks, the claim of 8 years of "anemic growth" is patently false based on any graph you look at of said 8 years.

1199 2018-01-31 16:51:33 CDC director quits following report she bought tobacco stocks. Hal Rogers R-KY, Has bought and sold McKesson stocks.

1200 2018-01-31 16:51:24 Followed by layoffs

1207 2018-01-31 16:49:23 In addition, I wonder how her conflicts weren’t a problem while she was GA Comm of Health. Perhaps her having soda & tobacco stocks did not present a conflict for GA.
1208 2018-01-31 16:49:08 Une jolie construction mathématique. La « hausse » du VIX sur la période est concentrée sur les 2 derniers mois. Le VIX étant beaucoup plus asymétrique dans son comportement que les stocks, les calculs de moyennes sont faussés. Corrélation SP500 / VIX = -0,9 de mémoire

1211 2018-01-31 16:48:11 traders of frac sand stocks, chew on this:
1212 2018-01-31 16:47:54 CDC Director Fitzgerald bought tobacco stocks, and then resigned for it.

President Obama smoked, financially supporting the tobacco industry. Nothing happened.

And here we have the media and Democrat Party double standard...
1213 2018-01-31 16:47:15 You didn’t mention that stocks had their single biggest drop in value in 8-months. Your adulterous daddy doesn’t have anything more to do with the stock market than Obama or any other POTUS. #JuniorForJail
1214 2018-01-31 16:47:12 You realize that insider trading my congress people on both sides of the aisle is a huge problem?  Look up how much money the D's made from healthcare Co donations and whose portfolios then traded healthcare stocks before the Obamacare vote
1215 2018-01-31 16:47:05 It Is a joke bump stocks can be made on a 3d printer. Plus the fact to people think it makes weapons fully auto. It only allows for like 3 round burst. A ban would not have changed what happened.
1216 2018-01-31 16:46:54 Line them up correctly and a single bullet from a high velocity rifle would sort a few of them out, or better still bring back the stocks; I'd travel many miles to pummel Thornberry et al with rotten fruit

1226 2018-01-31 16:43:28 In trump’s administration, people take government jobs not for public service but to enrich themselves. Was the plan that after industries were deregulated, the stocks would rise? Was the CDC going to declare that cigarettes weren’t bad for your health after all? Criminal!!
1227 2018-01-31 16:43:23 Most retirement funds contain stocks, so you probably do if you work at a job with benefits.

1230 2018-01-31 16:43:16 And this morning another of Trump’s “best people” resigns in shame. Head of the CDC caught investing in tobacco stocks.
1231 2018-01-31 16:42:30 Trump’s CDC Director resigns after reports that she purchased tobacco stocks while leading our anti-smoking campaign. Another example of the “best” people hired by. @realDonaldTrump #Traitor
1232 2018-01-31 16:41:50 Brenda Fitzgerald - CDC Dir. resigns due to buying tobacco stocks WHILE DIRECTOR.

1233 2018-01-31 16:41:43 Yeah some weak hands for sure I do my due diligence this stock has too much going for it I ain’t selling $grdo I have learned patience and intuition in stocks
1234 2018-01-31 16:41:33 this played out well as a contrarian bet in early 2017.  you seem pretty bearish on stocks mid-term David?
1235 2018-01-31 16:41:19 so far the new purge has meant that both darts and motor racing have lost the only thing they had to recommend them. Get rid of 'box girls' and I'll have to sell my stocks and shares.
1236 2018-01-31 16:41:13 dear @UR_Speedway. Please look into building a truly affordable entry level class. We need an avenue for new participation in the sport and Pro Stocks aren't it.
1237 2018-01-31 16:40:43 If you go with reality & not Trump’s lies & exaggerations you know wages are too low for too many, half the country doesn’t have stocks.

1239 2018-01-31 16:40:01 As part of the compensation package for CDC Directors they should give them a large short position on tobacco stocks at the start of their term
1240 2018-01-31 16:40:00 Stocks up 8000 pts Trumps 1st yr--bluster?  Lowest Black and Hispanic unemployment EVER--bluster? Rising wages--bluster? Huge bonuses--bluster? Savings, pension, 401ks way up--bluster?  No, you are Bluster, good new is bad news to you.  Sad, craven demagogue
1241 2018-01-31 16:39:55 @jaketapper @tax cuts for the corporations.  This translates to bonuses to officers.  New hires at GE get no pension and if you last to retirement, you get no medical.  As for the stocks being discussed, most like Apple are giving restricted stock
1242 2018-01-31 16:39:54 Podría ser un buen catalizador para tirar con confianza! 
1243 2018-01-31 16:39:33 Jeff Bezos just decided to embellish himself yesterday, knowing the healthcare stocks would dive and he could increase Amazon stock, part of the plan, meanwhile JP Morgan traders are buying the healthcare stock dips..no genius required to figure that out
1244 2018-01-31 16:38:58 Not really. Traditionally investing in stocks has been about the dividends. That doesn't necessarily have to do with growth of the company or share price. 

Addmitedly, this dynamic has gone out of whack in the last few years.
1245 2018-01-31 16:38:49 Meanwhile, pot stocks keep getting higher and higher.
Many are still cheap enough for anyone to buy.
Buy now and wait a couple years.
Be good if working class buy into pot stocks and saw their fortunes rise.
It'd be some kind of revenge
1246 2018-01-31 16:38:30 It’s about making money. If tobacco stocks will make you money then buy them
1247 2018-01-31 16:38:29 Director of CDC resigns after telling Americans "don't smoke" wait! "smoke". Accused of buying tobacco stocks while leading a premiere organization working on the healthy lives of Americans. I guess her personal motto was "wealth over health"
1248 2018-01-31 16:38:27 Lol. Well this is definitely not a penny stock, but it doesn't have any revenue yet so I guess yeah...the bet is will they revenue and they will. But Canada is infested with TSX Venture stocks which 2/3 of which need delisting.
1249 2018-01-31 16:38:21 1929 Middle class deep in debt, low wages, all $$ going to top, 1% own stocks, stocks over price, GOP controlled House & POTUS
1250 2018-01-31 16:37:48 As a CDC head trading tobacco and healthcare stocks, Brenda Fitzgerald proves to be just another fox in charge of the henhouse.

Either this administration is maliciously criminal, pathetically incompetent, or a combination of the two.
1251 2018-01-31 16:37:46 hacking it up so bad you had to look at stocks again? gtfo and golf ya bastard. otherwise ill send this cold weather to ya

1255 2018-01-31 16:36:49 is it possible to find out the dispersion situations between an index and its constituent stocks?For example,SP500
1256 2018-01-31 16:36:09  Les stocks de pétrole aux Etats-Unis ont augmenté pour la première fois en 2 mois.
+6,776 millions de barils en plus dans les stocks la semaine dernière.
1257 2018-01-31 16:36:02 Should have bought pot stocks!
1258 2018-01-31 16:35:50 反省しました
1259 2018-01-31 16:35:48 Bulls should actually want it. Stocks do better once they are removed.
1260 2018-01-31 16:35:47 stocks more important than service...the trump way money first
1261 2018-01-31 16:35:38 I would think with Trump’s SOTU points about $1.5 trillion infrastructure spending, stocks like $FRTA and $BW would get a boost
1262 2018-01-31 16:35:19 isn't this what people expect from stocks?
1263 2018-01-31 16:34:47 The American Medical Association had huge holdings in tobacco stocks into the 1970s. This kind of conflict of interest is impossible to justify. Divestment is normally a sufficient remedy, but this case has an additional layer of unseemliness due to the timing of the purchase.
1264 2018-01-31 16:34:34 Sams Club gains a HUGE tax benefit and the next day closes 63 stores. One of too many corps to mention ending jobs, buying back stocks, rewarding with bonuses.
1265 2018-01-31 16:34:16 The newly appointed HHD Secretary, who replaces the one removed for using private planes on govt business, was a top Eli Lilly executive. The head of the CDC who resigned today traded tobacco stocks even after taking office. The poison trickles down from the very top.
1266 2018-01-31 16:34:14 Really shaky long trading day today, unless you were in early on these stocks. My short trades worked wonderfully though. $bspm $mara
1267 2018-01-31 16:34:03 #OBC & #BLOC Quite happy with the SP movement today - both in my PF and fully expect either of these stocks to go ballistic near term.
1268 2018-01-31 16:33:19 I’m sorry, but I’m a YUGE @realDonaldTrump supporter, and NO doctor serving in any policy position should be investing in tobacco companies. Or alcohol stocks. Or drug company stocks. Folks, this ain’t rocket science.
1269 2018-01-31 16:33:11 Anyone know why the trading volume for $DIGAF is above daily average already?  #Stocks #News #Cryptocurrency
1270 2018-01-31 16:32:55 Brenda Fitzgerald is the type of personality that speaks to greed, over anything else. 

Including her job.
From which she just resigned. 

Now she can go back to buying tobacco stocks in the thousands. 
1271 2018-01-31 16:32:12 A "doctor" invests in tobacco stocks....ugh.....
1272 2018-01-31 16:32:04 This year I want to invest in stocks
1273 2018-01-31 16:31:59 "I feel this is all a misunderstanding," said Director Fitzgerald "I bought shares in *tabasco* stocks"
1274 2018-01-31 16:31:53 Pending Home Sales decline. Stocks rebounding. ADP Private Payrolls beats expectations.
1275 2018-01-31 16:30:57 I've drank enough coffee over these past few days from preparing for #TFF2018, teaching zoology, and working on research that I am starting to consider investing in @Starbucks stocks.
1276 2018-01-31 16:30:46 My question about the CDC director resignation story: Politico reports Fitzgerald had sold all the stocks that were a potential conflict of interest by November, but HHS statement this morning talks about her owning "certain complex financial interests" forcing her to recuse now.
1277 2018-01-31 16:30:36 She is probably getting out before someone does in depth research and finds others conflicts in her history. I mean, what kind of dumbshit owns tobacco stocks in this  day and age....only another greedy swamp creature with no regard for human life,,,
1278 2018-01-31 16:30:26 Maybe they're rasist or making money through stocks. Only 2 things I could come up with.
1279 2018-01-31 16:30:09 She wasn’t very smart then, you don’t buy stocks in a company that your job is to try to get the public to quit smoking and hurt that company.
1280 2018-01-31 16:29:45 Not just bc she held tobacco stocks - unfortunately millions of Americans likely own tobacco via their 401ks or pensions. But to go out and BUY tobacco stocks when you are in the position where it creates a clear conflict of interest... How much $$ did she make?
1281 2018-01-31 16:29:10 So after last night’s SOTU, the take away is: stocks are soaring, tax cuts will work, and you got your raise ($67 billion for the 1%, and four cent/hr for the rest of us).  In other words: Make America Wait Again
1282 2018-01-31 16:28:54 On the other hand, the government is in for a HUGE windfall when many of these all time high stocks are sold.
1283 2018-01-31 16:28:53 Untill the midcaps bleeding stops don't expect HEG to go UC..

Graphite also announced spectacular result but we all know what happened today. All the carbon stocks will move in a pack once MCap starts performing..
1284 2018-01-31 16:28:52 Poll: Biotech stocks are down Weds. in an overall up market. Is Trump's mention of drug pricing in SOTU at all to blame?
1285 2018-01-31 16:28:48 The new head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resigned after her investments in tobacco stocks drew criticism
1286 2018-01-31 16:28:26 @tedlieu CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald resigns after report she invested in tobacco stocks. If she hadn't resigned the next CDC report would say smoking is great for you.
1287 2018-01-31 16:27:46 Yet our Representatives and Senators are still allowed to use inside information garnered in their job to trade stocks.
1288 2018-01-31 16:27:29 Never easy. For sure!  I would rather know 8 stocks REALLY well than 20  just so-so.  I take the Key List and take stocks off during the day. Less is better. As you stated!

1291 2018-01-31 16:27:11 Classy! Dr Brenda Fitzgerald resigns from CDC cause she bought tobacco, drug, & food firm stocks while on the job AND could not "divest from them in a definitive time period"
1292 2018-01-31 16:26:37 Pending Home Sales decline. Stocks rebounding. ADP Private Payrolls beats expectations.
1293 2018-01-31 16:26:34 Just an observation- If FoxandFriends had run a story last year about MS 13 using bump stocks, the Las Vegas shooting would never have happened. Governance by fear and racism isn’t leadership.
1294 2018-01-31 16:26:14 Why not if it really happens I'll sell other stocks to load it again. At this rythm and because of the number of noobs in this market I'll reach a million shares 
1295 2018-01-31 16:26:00 You need USD to acquire all assets. Stocks, precious metals, bonds, real estate&as much BTC or any other crypto you believe in. But we don't need a way out of USD. When everyone sees their BTC go way up they're so excited because its worth more USD.Don't forget that simple point.
1296 2018-01-31 16:25:44 All future directors may only invest in Kale stocks.

1309 2018-01-31 16:22:35 Y'all tripping...i made some great accomplishments in Jan. Stayed on with my side part and wearing perfume every day  (those were my 2018 goals). Launched 2 new projects and a new store at work, and bought my first stocks outside a mutual fund
1310 2018-01-31 16:21:49 Apparently she bought the stocks after her appointment went through...
1311 2018-01-31 16:21:16 Most of the regular middle class in the midwest isn't feeling it. We see industry leaving and good jobs shrinking. Even Wal Mart and Sams Club are closing and malls are empty.  Most of us don't have stocks or 401K's.

1314 2018-01-31 16:20:24 Yes. Please tell me any other industry that kills 33,000 Americans a year. And then when anyone ever tries to limit anything and I mean anything the lobbying group and people go crazy screaming that we are coming for the product. Whatever happened about bump stocks? NOTHING!
1315 2018-01-31 16:20:02 Lol this is cynical on so many levels  the head of the CDC with stocks in one of the most unhealthiest products

1319 2018-01-31 16:19:16 True.  Then there's the substance of his administration: the CDC director he nominated was profiting from the rise in tobacco stocks.  

Hate to say it, but Trump's minions did indeed have a plan, but it was to make money off the epidemic. 1/

1331 2018-01-31 16:16:12 Trump's CDC Director resigning over buying tobacco stocks isn't a big deal.  Obama smoked.  That means he supported or supports tobacco companies financially.  Nobody demanded he resign for that.
1332 2018-01-31 16:15:49 Any particular stocks to look forward to?
1333 2018-01-31 16:15:13 Not just tobacco stock but drug company stocks too. Right?

1339 2018-01-31 16:13:19 Clear market manipulation. Dumping poor performing stocks and replacing with hot stocks. At this rate, the Dow will be 50,000 soon.
1340 2018-01-31 16:13:19 The irony in a sneaker collector not understanding timing in regard to stocks is hilarious

Trade hitting the emails / texts in about 15 miuntes
1342 2018-01-31 16:12:37 Yes, and it's generally pretty highly correlated with the S&P, flaws and all. When I teach the Dow, I point out the flaws (price-weighted, only 30 stocks) and then note that 30 is sort of the magic number of stocks that drives idiosyncratic risk to a nominal amount.
1343 2018-01-31 16:12:10 Garrett & I will differ from Avi from time to time and EVEN sometimes from each other(rarely )... MANY ind stocks argue for trying to start Minor 4 or equivalent... but no real support broken... yet.

1346 2018-01-31 16:11:37 Surely one of her uber-successful businesses stocks a cream for all this?
1347 2018-01-31 16:11:31 Markets fading off highs. Our reaction? WATCH and don't force trades. The "M" in MISSION is the most important letter. That's why it comes first. @MissionWinners #stocks #investing
1348 2018-01-31 16:11:28 Yes, just a fancy new name for "debt monetization" and recycling the money printed into stocks.
1349 2018-01-31 16:11:28 Brenda Fitzgerald, excellent nominee of Trump, head of CDC. confirmed in July, resigned in Jan, owns tobacco stocks, profiting from smoking.
1350 2018-01-31 16:11:16 Define irony - head of the CDC steps down after investing in tobacco stocks.  Hmm.  Any other figureheads want to step down?
1351 2018-01-31 16:11:13 Many stocks are on their 3rd partial day down, or greater.  Often takes only two.

1355 2018-01-31 16:10:23 Stock markets are irrational and hence Govt shouldn't take credit. But it's simple to make stocks rise than fix economy.

1359 2018-01-31 16:09:43 exactly.  Market is never wrong in the long-run be it tulip bulbs, dotcom stocks, crypto-currencies, and ballplayers.  Salaries were in a bubble phase and agents were seeking to move ithigher and higher.  Thankfully, sanity is taking hold.
1360 2018-01-31 16:09:23 I don't know what is more f'ed up, the Director of the #CDC buying tobacco stocks, or FEMA ending food shipments to #PuertoRico . Honestly, it feels like everyone and everything sucks.
1361 2018-01-31 16:09:21 So The Head Of The CDC Bought Tobacco Stocks

1394 2018-01-31 16:00:10 The chief of CDC resigned after people finding out she invested in tobacco stocks. What a world we live in.
1395 2018-01-31 16:00:02 I have this angry libertarian streak in me. I totally understand the issue, but losing a job over stocks purchased is a little too far for me. Adults can, and should be allowed to, choose to smoke.
1396 2018-01-31 15:59:40 Do the wealthy-but-not-obscenely-rich routinely employ financial managers empowered to independently make five-figure investments in individual stocks on their behalf despite knowing so little about their client that they regularly entangle them in obvious conflicts of interest?
1397 2018-01-31 15:59:33 Imagine how bad it must be to force a Trump lackey to step down. I'd guess it goes much deeper than tobacco stocks.
1398 2018-01-31 15:59:31 So Trump's CDC head was trading tobacco stocks. Tobacco. While heading the Center for Disease Control. Wrap your head around that, and Happy Wednesday.
1399 2018-01-31 15:59:29 Now you are just making shit up. Owning stocks that an adviser buys on your behalf and then selling them is hardly being "owned". Do better than this crap. Joe is literally beyond reproach unlike your mafia master.
1400 2018-01-31 15:59:26 .@realDonaldTrump's #CDC head #BrendaFitzgerald resigning because she bought tobacco stocks after assuming the job feels like the most this-is-your-government-on-Trump moment yet, but we are still just a year in so we need to keep those nominations open.

1410 2018-01-31 15:57:10 What's even worse about the Fitzgerald #CDC story is that she clearly didn't think owning shares in a tobacco company ran counter to her role.

A public health official proactively acquiring stocks in multiple transnational tobacco firms. The absurdity of it.

1414 2018-01-31 15:56:01 Question: can anyone name a time when a company sold 100% of their stock to another company and it ended up being a good thing for the company that sold their stocks?
Serious question. I really don't know the answer to this and I have a personal interest in the matter.

1422 2018-01-31 15:52:50 Stocks (in theory) increase in price because the real value of the company increases due to their growth.

But yes, bubbles in the stock market happen too.

1442 2018-01-31 15:50:34 Trump’s CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald resigns after buying tobacco stocks WHILE leading the agency charged with reducing tobacco use. Don’t smoke kids. It’s bad for your health. Instead buy tobacco stocks and profit off of other people’s addiction. FILL THE SWAMP WITH SMOKE.

1447 2018-01-31 15:50:00 She did the right thing in divesting. We do not know if the decision to buy these particular stocks were made by Fitzgerald directly or a financial management company.
1448 2018-01-31 15:49:48 She was supposed to sell off any tobacco or conflicting stocks when she got the job. Instead she bought more 
1449 2018-01-31 15:49:28 Le dogmatisme du RMD sans prendre en compte les aspects socio-économiques ? Il reste 2 ans pour mettre les stocks au RMD, comme l’exige la PCP.

1450 2018-01-31 15:49:27 Like Fitzgerald, the head of CDC, trading in tobacco stocks while she's supposed to be preventing smoking. Sounds like she planned on benefitting big tobacco instead.
1451 2018-01-31 15:49:16 He had to save the nation From the great bush recession, and he did that. The value of your home, 401(k)s and stocks have all rebounded, so that seems to have been well worth it. You sound ill-informed.
1452 2018-01-31 15:48:48 He is as believable as the devil. By the way..another Trump thief and liar is OUT.

1454 2018-01-31 15:48:13 And people are buying stocks because they expect other people to buy it from them at a lower price. Right?
1455 2018-01-31 15:48:01 It’s silly to waste energy listening to budget wish list...focus on the what you can ‘control’...the budget will come and go...TRPs rise...Stocks?
1456 2018-01-31 15:47:31 For a split second I allowed myself to think the CDC director bought the stocks as a way to give up her position but then I remember she could've just resigned. She really DGAF. After all she sees how others fly in the face of ethics without consequence.
1457 2018-01-31 15:47:22 If you’ve got spare savings and looking for long term investments, get into genome engineering stocks because advancements in CRISPR will steer many industries over the next 5 years. Many genome ETFs have seen 100% ROI over the last year alone. #DNA #CRISPR #GenomeEditing
1458 2018-01-31 15:47:20 You also have to have faith in the coaches as well.  New England and Philadelphia (surprise) have been doing this for a while now.  Trading up and coming players while their stocks were on the uprise... trusting their draft board and the coaches they have in place.
1459 2018-01-31 15:47:15 She did the right thing, She didn't testify and she couldn't or wouldn't divest from those stocks so she resigned!! Get over it!!

1467 2018-01-31 15:45:36 I remember a day when prices on bonds and stocks had a generally inverse relationship.

Central banks broke that correlation.

Maybe CNN is actually right?

Rising rates will crater housing market. Stocks would likely follow.

Weird times.

1469 2018-01-31 15:45:25 I fail to see how the purchase of stocks which supports tobacco companies WHICH ARE putting their money and efforts toward helping people AWAY FROM DANGEROUS USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SMOKING, should besmirch the record of the director of the CDC. Are we that inept?

1570 2018-01-31 15:29:02 During the Market collapse in 2008 people panicked & sold stocks that werent really affected by housing collapse.

Then 'value investors' came in when the P/E ratios got too low and put in a 'floor' or 'bottom.' 

When that happened the Stock Market had NO WHERE to go BUT up.
1571 2018-01-31 15:27:47 @RBIPodcast if, hypothetically, you thought there was going to be a big drop in the stock market this year, what specifically would you invest in to hedge that risk?

1573 2018-01-31 15:27:21 A CDC head bought stocks in tobacco! Let that sink in.
1574 2018-01-31 15:27:13 The CDC is charged with reducing tobacco addiction & monitoring tobacco related health effects. Clear conflict of interest. Worse, she purchased ADDITIONAL STOCKS AFTER being sworn in.
1575 2018-01-31 15:26:52 The 0% Fed Funds Rate allowed Corporations that had low earnings to borrow money to buyback stocks and pay dividends to entice investors to purchase their stock. Basically paying people for owning their stock.

When panic selling happens, people sell ALL THEIR STOCKS.
1576 2018-01-31 15:26:45 Breaking:  Georgia's Brenda Fitzgerald resigns as head of CDC because she owns tobacco stocks.  Was appointed by Tom Price in July.  He left over the exorbitant travel issue.

1582 2018-01-31 15:25:32 "Brenda Fitzgerald". Okay, what about the stocks Trump owns?  Someone definitely needs to check.
1583 2018-01-31 15:25:24 Trump literally has one thing going for him economically: the stock market. He's cut taxes and regulation so more people gamble in stocks. Big deal. That doesn't affect half of the US.

Obama added more jobs-per-month than Trump-who has done nothing with jobs, wages, education...

1587 2018-01-31 15:24:43 The real question is why she invested in those stocks in the first place.  it’s my understanding that you call your financial advisor and say SELL they do it that day.  Complex financial investments is a cop out.

1599 2018-01-31 15:21:36 This is an example of how Trump is affecting how people are buying into companies and holding a high level federal government position. This is a good example of conflict of interest. How can the head of the CDC buy stocks in a tobacco company?

1623 2018-01-31 15:17:25 Obama did NOTHING to help the Economy. Nothing. What happened was Obama TOOK ADVANTAGE or the the economic collapse that happened under Bush-43. The Stock Market was 'OVER SOLD' and had no where to go but up. 

There was panic selling and it lowered the P/E ratios of stocks.

1631 2018-01-31 15:15:15 From Trumps own mouth he said 3 million workers have gotten a bonus. That is less then 1% of the US estimated population. Educate yourselves on the reality. The majority of us are getting buttkiss. 84% of stocks are help by 10% of our population. How is that a win for ALL of us.
1632 2018-01-31 15:15:13 The top public health official in the country just resigned because she fucking traded tobacco stocks WHILE IN OFFICE. TOBACCO STOCKS. What kind of alternate reality are we living in? Holy shit.
1633 2018-01-31 15:14:58 Why on earth did she think investing in tobacco stocks was a good idea, considering the CDC's position on smoking?

1653 2018-01-31 15:11:25 Yeah, and when she makes that transaction - plus other health-related stocks - after she's in the job, that's a huge red flag. Glad it was caught.

1656 2018-01-31 15:10:24 My take: she lost money on her stocks. Selling them would realize her losses so instead she resigns and hopes the stocks come back to where she bought them, then she may sell.

1669 2018-01-31 15:07:26 I dunno seems a lil like you had a weak hand on a big pullback. I’m all for diversifying but selling after a big pullback for losses seems like a lack of patience. You’re going to need big gains in new stocks to make up the loss rather than just waiting

- Director of CDC is resigning after caught buying tobacco stocks.

What a great country. NOT!!!!
1682 2018-01-31 15:04:29 It's all about making money for the Trumpsters. Head of CDC, buy cigarette stocks. Head of Energy, tariffs on solar panels to benefit the fossil fuel industry that donates huge sums to the Republicans.
1683 2018-01-31 15:03:29 Heh Trumpists - is this the swamp draining you voted for, Trumps CDC head insider trading in stocks while manipulating their industries through her policies?  If you can't tell when you're being conned, PLEASE, stop voting.  You're killing yourselves as well as the rest of us.
1684 2018-01-31 15:03:22 Long way from you but there's a lovely lady with an independent bra shop called the fitting room in Stevenage. Might be worth contacting her for brand recommendations as I know she stocks larger sizes and does maternity bras. She's on Facebook too x

1783 2018-01-31 14:28:49 Agree. And I recall people telling me to sell all & buy gold for many years now.
So far: Max 5% gold (always a nice gain), 15% to 45% stocks, property & cash. So far, so good. Just sad that #Draghi won't give me interest on cash.
1784 2018-01-31 14:28:26 $1k is short term the problem is stagnant wages let's see those go up. Instead your "tax cut" is increasing my taxes by $2k. The stock market is going up because corporations are buying back stocks  not increasing wages.
1785 2018-01-31 14:28:21 $UNH making a nice comeback. Most healthcare stocks were oversold yesterday on $AMZN news.  Same thing happened to $COST (went down, then recovered) when $AMZN bought Whole Foods.  Lesson: watch when $AMZN disrupts a company/sector and sell puts on the dip of affected company(s).

1788 2018-01-31 14:26:36 So, when the government decides to ban crypto. Then it bans the fact that you can freely trade in companies (as most of the projects are more or less companies). Will we ban stocks then also?

And, if it is due to terrorism. Do we ban cash then also?

1802 2018-01-31 14:22:03 Yeah, exactly - it's just a bit impressive that they can pick the right stocks to include when, say, they can't include AAPL for years because the share price is too high.

1813 2018-01-31 14:17:55 Well, market reaction was pretty muted last night. No big moves in rates or the dollar when he announced the bigger number. Stocks are going to open up a bit, but probably due to some pre earnings positioning. Markets have learned to ignore him.

1815 2018-01-31 14:17:26 Real estate investing is more complicated than investing in stocks because of the financial, legal, and extensive due diligence requirements involved. That’s why it’s a good idea to give yourself a solid education before you purchase your first investment property.
1816 2018-01-31 14:17:10 Many years ago, I was in the Harvard Financial Analysts Club. I was tasked with pitching my group two stocks. Both of them were rejected. But both of them I still watch closely. One of them I believe is a double or triple from here. I will have my avocado day.

1825 2018-01-31 14:11:22 I think a MF marketing blitz and demonetisation fueled this growth of unrealiable stocks. Once a crash.. all small investor lose monies and blame the fund manager or modi. The Monkey killing bulls move to alternate avenues like realestate etc.

1845 2018-01-31 14:04:12 Re: the economy, he's done exactly what he said he would. Lower taxes, cut regulations, etc., and it's paid off in huge ways. Unemployment low, business confidence high, stocks high, taxes low, no more mandate, it's been a home run from that standpoint. People are better off.
1846 2018-01-31 14:04:07 Ok . Make perfect sense . Never traded in stocks and I do have system created based on purely Index Option chain . Thanks for the idea . Price change+ future OI data+ Option OI will be good combo . Will give a try
1847 2018-01-31 14:04:06 Lot of focus on GE's vanishing weighting in the Dow. But a bigger distortion is from the five stocks now above $200. 

Recall, Apple was only added after a stock split dropped its share price below $100. When Visa was admitted, its then-$178 share price was considered a stretch.

1874 2018-01-31 13:53:47 I will just have to top up your stocks if they are depleted, seeing that it's me that's supposed to bring the "peace pipe"
1875 2018-01-31 13:53:45 the 'bubble' in the Sensex might well also burst if capital gains tax is brought in on stocks - the economy is most certainly on a nose dive despite 'pumped up' futuristic reports from 'outside powers' #Budget
1876 2018-01-31 13:53:40 I’m for 2a, but that should have ALWAYS been held to handguns &  hunting rifles. The reason AR15s & bump stocks are around is so you guys can get off on shooting them. If ppl say they use them to hunt they aren’t real hunters. The NRA is the biggest pusher of propaganda in the US
1877 2018-01-31 13:52:36 Option chain is more suitable for index...for stocks i don't look at option chain coz options are thinly traded for stocks. Instead Futures OI more relevant for stocks. Hence if at all u wish to create an OI based system u must include Futures OI of stocks with Option Chain
1878 2018-01-31 13:49:31 yeah but they're just like stocks or commodities, right? the top 10 percent will be just fine
1879 2018-01-31 13:49:00 "If you love trading, you are doing it wrong" I could not understand this quote about stocks when i read it almost a year ago. I was enjoying back then. Today i understand it very well, i even almost hate it! No i am not in loss, it is hard to explain but i just hate it anymore.
1880 2018-01-31 13:48:56 1/ If someone else buys your stocks (if they don't, it isn't real money yet), then they have to pay more than if they were lower, so it cancels out - people don't have more money *total* due to rise in stock market "values."
1881 2018-01-31 13:48:55 I will

1930 2018-01-31 13:27:06 It has? How? You do know that very few corperations are passing the money they are saving on to their employees or using it to create new jobs don't you. The vast majority is going into deep pockets &/or being invested in buying back stocks at inflated prices.

I told you
1950 2018-01-31 13:16:11 Today was a great trading day. 

I haven’t shorted stocks for a long time but it might be more of that. Faster moves to the downside as we all know. Almost hoping for the bull market to end so its gets easier even if earnings day probably its the best day to short.
1951 2018-01-31 13:15:54 Joe Kennedy: stock market is up but 50% of americans don’t owe stock.

1960 2018-01-31 13:11:55 So, you think we all have the right to have and use bumps stocks instead of the right to have our children be safe?  Because banning bump stocks was the other little piece your subcommittee killed this week.  Why is the NRA more important to you than your constituents' lives?
1961 2018-01-31 13:10:49 @DaveRamsey moving my 401k to IRA with one of your ELPs.  They are recommended ETFs and direct stocks vs traditional Mutual Funds to save the brokerage fee. Kind of flies in the face of what I understand from your teaching. Thoughts?

1982 2018-01-31 13:00:43 The Dow Jones is really not the optimum source to judge US stock market performance. The index is driven more by stocks with larger share prices than smaller share prices. $GE is now a bit player because shares are $16 whereas $AAPL shares at $166 have ~10x more influence
1983 2018-01-31 13:00:19 Selling Oxy as a nonaddictive painkiller worked really well. Now we have cabinet members making money off of mass shootings as gun stocks rise and addiction rates increase. New CDC head bought tons of tobacco stock.  Good for business.

Genuinely curious.
1986 2018-01-31 12:58:51 Lady is right. All this increased value is based on nothing, smoke and mirrors, corporations buying their stocks back and increasing the price.  Be very careful.  9-10 months the experts say.  Caveat Emptor.
1987 2018-01-31 12:58:36 Not exactly a hot take, also major tech firms report today so Donnie could have said we are starting a trade war and stocks would go up

2044 2018-01-31 12:29:38 Who was it. That person needs to be named, shamed, pilloried and put in the stocks.
2045 2018-01-31 12:29:36 And if you don’t have stocks it doesn’t affect you at all. The stock market is like the lotto. People are taking bets on what they think will happen. It’s not a thermometer.

2047 2018-01-31 12:28:53 Trump makes grandiose statements about his accomplishments but a closer look shows, as usual, he takes credit where credit is not his. Stock market benefits those with stocks. Not the working class.
2048 2018-01-31 12:28:03 There's more to it than that. ..full econimic stats are meaningful.  Yes...stocks climbed. .. but it was a very stagnant recovery...a jobless recovery. ..gdp was stubbornly low...Trump did what Obama SHOULD have done...that's why bee are seeing investments and much more to come.

2054 2018-01-31 12:25:06 It is a perversion of the stock investment to emphasize its price over its dividends. Indeed, the purchase of stocks then ceases to be a transfer of capital investment, and becomes speculation. The Dow is today a speculative measure, an indicator of bubbles and their bursting.
2055 2018-01-31 12:24:56 I've asked precisely that so maybe I'll have an answer soon! 

Had years passed I'd accept it and understand but the authority is 16 months old, we've been in dialogue since then and now the shutters have gone up.

2059 2018-01-31 12:20:20 I know at least one FinTwit who is looking to short unambiguously overvalued stocks of good companies, in part b/c there's little risk blowup.

2061 2018-01-31 12:19:12 I don't get how one "refutes" the notion that in the main, buying back stock when stocks are at all-time highs is a bad idea.  Even if you think you are still above the hurdle rate, buying expensive assets is never intelligent.

That's how many points the Dow dropped over the first two days of this week. It's the worst two-day outing for stocks since September 2016.  Donnie's economic policies (lack thereof besides tax scam) starting to kick in? Yea Donnie-boy, so much whining, uh winning.

2072 2018-01-31 12:14:18 All of the media from day one is against President Trump because they can’t sway him in any way and is not a politician. I don’t see anyone complaining about their stocks or their 401K.

2088 2018-01-31 12:04:19 Not sure if your just being funny or generally dont know the answer but in any case sharing knowledge is better than leaving others in the drk. Now even if you don't own stocks, if you or one of your family members has a pension plan, that pension is partially invested in stocks.

2093 2018-01-31 12:01:45 China mines 90% of the world's rare earth minerals in China. Those stocks are finite & they're looking elsewhere for more. Particularly Africa. The governments are signing deals to build roads & electric infrastructure in Africa for mineral rights.
2094 2018-01-31 12:01:43 If you only make 10% in a year on stocks you need to learn to trade better.  Just saying....
2095 2018-01-31 12:01:19 Remains to be seen if cases related or not, regardless I rarely buy on high volume selling. Goal is to stay in stocks that are performing as expected/thesis playing out
2096 2018-01-31 12:01:16 Can we maybe measure how well the country is doing by how well the poor are doing, too, and not just the rich’s tax cuts and stocks? Do our poor have easy access to medical care, birth control, childcare, etc? THAT’S how you tell if a country is great.
2097 2018-01-31 12:01:07 Many people contacted me for my views on current meltdown in small/mid

*Stay clear of poor quality names with low conviction
* Have a risk management strategy with options/cash
* Find great stocks in a Fall
* Moderate returns expectations

2098 2018-01-31 11:59:31 I would not watch the speech, why would I read it.  60+% of Americans knew it would be more divisive than unified.  Economy-50% don’t own stocks and 80% of stocks are in the hands of the top 1%. Stocks are not the equivalent of “economy.”  Miller wrote the speech-Ugg

2100 2018-01-31 11:57:36 50% of people in the US don't own any stocks.

80% of stocks are owned by 10% of the people.

2129 2018-01-31 11:26:42 Really? Look at the official unemployment records since 2010. Obama took US out of 2008 recession, bailed out US auto, stocks went up 150%, Real Estate rebounded. Obama handed Trump with booming economy.

2154 2018-01-31 11:16:27 Hello Amy, they would need to call out Stocks and Shares Team directly on 0800 299 299 they are open Mon - Fri 08.00 - 18.00 ^AB
2155 2018-01-31 11:16:18 what kind of protections? the stock market is rigged that is why I like crypto much better. Yes there is manipulation but its not as rigged as stocks. Now the big money is coming in and there will be regulations and it will push out the little guys...
2156 2018-01-31 11:16:11 Why no response to black unemployed number. They are not showing because they have expired use. Tax cuts are offset by higher interest rate on cc and fees. Average American is not doing better. Only reason stocks were strong was tax giveaway. Sad
2157 2018-01-31 11:15:47 Watched that #Dirtymoney episode on @Netflix about the $VRX story.

Highly recommend.

Problem is now that I can't touch this stock at the moment. Emotionally biased.

Rule: Don't trade stocks where you are opinionated!

2158 2018-01-31 11:15:02 The worst day for stocks since SEP. That's right, Tuesday was the worst day for the S&P 500 since the first day of SEP. The S&P 500 was down only 1.08% yesterday. This ended an incredible streak of 99 days in a row without a 0.6% or greater loss. That puts it in perspective ...

2162 2018-01-31 11:14:01 @happeesy hi! I was also at One OK Rock's concert and I bought a shirt from your merch. Just recently, there are limited stocks for sale which includes free poster for every purchase. Is there any way I can get a poster without making another purchase again? Thank you.
2163 2018-01-31 11:13:11 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS

2172 2018-01-31 11:01:25 Stocks with great results had little upward price movement. Just shows how much pricey the stocks have become. Some examples:-

1. Graphite India
2. Avenue Supermart
3. PC Jewellers
4. Vakrangee

Expect this trend to continue in 2018.
2173 2018-01-31 11:01:17 Why I was seller in market now you can check stocks price. Index above 11 K and stocks almost down 20%
2174 2018-01-31 10:57:57 Use the numpad. 4 rows of 4 columns, almost. Quick row: buy ask, short bid, sell bid, cover ask. Slow row: buy bid, short ask, sell ask, covet bid. Market row: all market orders. Set with default quantities. Good for per/share commission probably.
2175 2018-01-31 10:56:34 By the time one becomes experieneced at finding good entry prices into the right stocks one has also learned the harsh lesson to sell into any sustained rise.
2176 2018-01-31 10:56:16 much harder if at all possible now. If huge players enter or exit the the market price will react so much that the move makes n sense. This is the opposite than what happens in FOREX and in stocks especially in emerging markets.
If you dig a bit deeper in #crypto I think that

2196 2018-01-31 10:37:18 Why oh why do third party #pension administrators make things more complicated than need be and create obstructions and/or requirements to suit themselves which is detrimental to THEIR clients.

Costs will only ever rise when providers and administrators put themselves first.
2197 2018-01-31 10:35:59 + amazed that card issuing banks still risking letting people borrow money on credit cards to speculate on unbacked stocks.

2199 2018-01-31 10:35:16 this rise in stocks since 2016 and YTD 2018 is likely why cons confidence numbers were higher. These 51.6% of people likely don't know what's under the hood right now on ultra high cons debt, delinquencies, cracks in autos/housing and more. That number will come down
2200 2018-01-31 10:34:27 I disagree with almost all David says on the substance of these Brexit matters.  But the word 'stock' is in common usage in econ, and using it is often helpful to clarify the analogy with other stocks into which there are inflows and outflows, mechanistic though it may be.

2221 2018-01-31 10:10:23 Please tell me how a billionaire is "in touch" with the common person? He keeps talking about stocks and a wall, but most people don't own shares and wouldn't be directly affected with the construction of a wall. Also lets not forget the tax bill he rammed through.
2222 2018-01-31 10:09:31 You are so delusional Liz. How is lower unemployment, rising stocks (yes, working people have 401ks), secure borders, enforcement of our laws, more take home pay, and a strong military "kicking working families in the gut"?
2223 2018-01-31 10:09:19 Yep lll remember that that my stocks when up my taxes went down and I have job options. I’ll also remember that the Dems are the party of higher taxes. Penalties for not being able to afford healthcare. And make me work harder so you can give handouts to illegals.
2224 2018-01-31 10:08:49 We have a futures market as well but limited to a select few stocks. Also the leverage is not suitable for speculative investors.

Q3 earnings are improving as expected. I think this volatility will pass after budget. Please advise if you think otherwise.

2520 2018-01-31 06:38:27 I wanna buy some stocks... then I remember I’m broke AF 
2521 2018-01-31 06:38:06 Good point Amit. Some stocks seem more susceptible than others. Do you know of any indicators that might help retail investors identify such stocks in advance, so they can be avoided?
2522 2018-01-31 06:36:02 10% of Americans own 80% of the stocks. It's irrelevant for the children in poverty, whose numbers are also up.

2524 2018-01-31 06:35:29 Asian stocks were mixed Wednesday after Wall Street recorded its biggest decline since August.
2525 2018-01-31 06:35:07 How about having a list of stocks broken out and retesting the breakout levels?
2526 2018-01-31 06:34:48 Stocks falling down like cards ... it's time to pick your fav. at lower prices. 

Stagger your purchases in small quantities so you can average it out, 

Do not sell in panic if you think you have invest in the  company, and not just traded its shares.

2530 2018-01-31 06:34:05 I like to earn my money the good old fashioned way. Work. Get rich quick by playing the slots at the casino, craps or stocks looks depressing. Money doesn’t buy me happiness.
2531 2018-01-31 06:33:32 Personally I see no reason to use @etrade over @thinkorswim. Their PDT rules are terrible compared to TOS. Their fees suck. Their platform is terrible, their Phone APP is disgusting... the only reason you would ever use them (OTC people only) is for DTC stocks.
2532 2018-01-31 06:33:19 With 2 graphs you may show whatever correlation, if there’s no logic behind it (why would bitcoin be leading stocks by 45 days??) it is just nonsense...

2537 2018-01-31 06:25:43 Not a lot of thought given to the correlation between unprecedented near decade long monetary policy accommodation incentive to invest in risk and performance in #cryptoassets.

2559 2018-01-31 06:14:41 Trump owned/owns stocks in Dakota access pipeline (not such a big deal in and of itself) but because he’s president, he did things to make it happen and happen fast. Here’s the kicker. Just after that, there was a leak near the protest site.
2560 2018-01-31 06:13:37 why you think he mentioned those stocks? cause he owns them n now more people gonna buy cause he has credentials

2569 2018-01-31 06:08:39 Trump is a bore, a crook, a narcistic do nothing,  embarrassment to the country and our nation. He's a 1% butt kisser for his own advantage. He's fooling none of us except Trumpsters who gage his success as the stock market. Talk about fools. Wonder how many stocks they have?

2573 2018-01-31 06:07:30 If rich entities are taxed for holding the stocks for longer period,it may prompt them to indulge in short term trading (because of smaller/zero tax difference) and may increase volatility in the market.

LTCG should not be on 'how much' you made, but 'over what period' you made.

2589 2018-01-31 05:54:44 I made money in stocks. I lost money in CDs that paid interest below the rate of inflation. Bernanke and Yellen both publicly admitted this was theft from savers.
2590 2018-01-31 05:54:30 One of my friends, who started investing in the rising Bull Market, called herself a Long-Term Value Investor with Buy-&-Hold Strategy.

Recently, one of her stocks corrected by 40%, while Nifty touched a new peak.
Following the herd mentality, she sold off her holdings.

2596 2018-01-31 05:52:34 It would've made a big difference in LV. The number of bodies in LV can be directly attributed to the shooters rate of fire, and the shooters rate of fire can be directly attributed to bump stocks. Also, we can ban bump stocks, and advocate for other common sense reforms.

2598 2018-01-31 05:52:16 So this is what you do, buy 51% of the company's stocks hold a board meeting to change their closing time then have them vote; now even if everyone votes against you you automatically win since you got 51% of the company !!!!

2629 2018-01-31 05:35:35 Yes the global economy is expanding. Yes it’s cyclical. Yes it started under Obama. But - yes too - Trump tax cut plans and a regulatory bonfire have contributed to the boom in stocks and, in some cases, to additional hiring and higher wages. So I plead not clueless!

2642 2018-01-31 05:29:05 In your portfolio, please explain why you chose the stocks you have and the variation between your safety stocks and your risky stocks. Are you a high risk or a low risk trader. If so, do you use put/ push options to offset the risk?
2643 2018-01-31 05:28:56 I've heard a dozen times that Turnbull's stocks are up, he's turned a corner, but the only ones fooled are the press. Has only gone one way in eyes of public.

2648 2018-01-31 05:25:52 Aussie shares have recovered from losses earlier in the day with the #ASX 200 closing +15pts or 0.25% at 6038pts. Most sectors were higher with just materials & energy stocks lower #ausbiz

2650 2018-01-31 05:23:02 Hahaha, opinions are so subjective. But for a change , try to be objective. Can you honestly say that we were better off under Obama? Why did you say Trump is the worst President? You don’t like the extra money on your pay check? You don’t like to see the stocks going up?
2651 2018-01-31 05:22:22 Pharma stocks have started reacting.

1. Lower Taxes
2. Lowest Unemployment for Blacks, Hispanics, Women in HISTORY
3. ISIS being on the retreat
4. 401 K, Stocks on the RISE
5. Several MAJOR companies [Apple, Exxon, etc coming BACK TO THE USA...
Shit, count my black ass happy!! SMH
2656 2018-01-31 05:21:22 A lot of the good specs were still manipulated down today on little volumes. Some brokers out there are trying to force stocks lower after selling higher to re buy lower imo. Not much volume coming out so they may get caught out on news or markets firing again.
2657 2018-01-31 05:21:16 Hmm, so 50 lacs in 1 Financial Year for stocks or Mutual Fund units “ redeemed “ or “sold” in the markets. I think I can live with that and so can 100+ crore people. The ultra rich might find it a little painful then.
2658 2018-01-31 05:20:59 Did he also bring up the victims of the Vegas massacre and call for the end of "bump stocks"?
2659 2018-01-31 05:20:31 FEEL THE PAIN TO GAIN

Many folks buy stocks and hope for a fast movement within a few days, and get disappointed when stocks don't move.

Last year's rally raised already fast and furious expectations.

To make serious cash, you must be patient.

2661 2018-01-31 05:18:19 Joe Kennedy: "We see an economy that makes stocks soar, investor portfolios bulge and corporate profits climb but fails to give workers their fair share of the reward." Sounds like a winning message for November.

2667 2018-01-31 05:13:52 Harley Davidson is closing plants as well.. they are so uninformed. Yet they think trump is doing something. All those talking about  money they are making in stocks are lying. That old saying what goes up must go down is real.
2668 2018-01-31 05:13:49 @garyvee I’m just now starting with Robinhood to dabble in stocks. I’m thinking about buying 20 Facebook shares right off. Do you recommend going all in on FB or buying some FB and some others as well? From your podcast you had said any extra money you have, buy FB
2669 2018-01-31 05:13:13 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD
2670 2018-01-31 05:12:40 Did you add any new stocks? Philips carbon holding?
2671 2018-01-31 05:12:35 No! I’m all about the penny stocks!
2672 2018-01-31 05:12:18 Even reading that conversation feels badass. Thanks to both of you for your service
2673 2018-01-31 05:12:09 I really wanna get into buying stocks but i have no idea what I’m doing

1. Will the Galaxy Surfactants IPO rerate surfactant stocks?

2. Why in God's name did Ashwani Gujral block me though I honestly appreciated his advice?
2678 2018-01-31 05:10:05 Private prison stocks skyrocketed on Trump's election.  It's much easier to make money incarcerating nonviolent immigration violators than murderers.
2679 2018-01-31 05:09:56 80% of stocks are owned by the top 1%, but I'm glad the crumbs are making you happy.
2680 2018-01-31 05:09:50 If you haven’t learned. Crypto millionaires aren’t made by day trading.. They are made by investing into real world, and problem solving blockchain technologies. Then, you #HODL them, and buy on the dips and the fat dips. You invest. Just like you would with stocks and a 401k
2681 2018-01-31 05:09:47 Good Morning Nilesh Bhai.
Thanks for sharing your analysis...True...everyone suspecting rise in index while stocks went down...clueless about the 4 ? ....as a master blaster of markets, u should also give a small clue to help small retail guys like me....please.

WHY DID HE MAKE ALL THE STOCKS GO DOWN?

WHY ARE YOU CRASHING THE MARKETS?

2696 2018-01-31 05:03:34 All FAKE data, FAKE polls.... Yellow Turd is enjoying the fruits of Obama. His policy effects will come only in 2018 and after. $1 trillion deficit will kill the economy by increasing the interest rate, which will bring the Stocks down and the bonds down. Inflation up! Downhill!
2697 2018-01-31 05:03:22 Lol how is it theft?? Owning apart of a business is theft??  Stocks and shares are your participation the business not just numbers running of electronic screen.  Though each for his own you like to sulk about others making more money than you, that's called as being smart.
2698 2018-01-31 05:03:09 saw an article titled "who is John Galt and what stocks would he buy" and i am DEAD
2699 2018-01-31 05:01:21 Where did you get the 10% of the people own 84% of the stocks? I would like to see where this statistic comes from?

2701 2018-01-31 04:58:58 Trump says he doing much for the economy because the stockmarket is doing well...But forgets that most americans don’t own stocks.
2702 2018-01-31 04:58:21 How are pharma stocks doing
2703 2018-01-31 04:58:10 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
2704 2018-01-31 04:57:40 I can't contend with this stupidity anymore. The one thing he has done is tax cuts, adding $1.5 trillion to our debt. The other thing he's taking credit for (not that he's accomplished) is the DOW being up. Not a measure of our economy, just stocks. Open your eyes.
2705 2018-01-31 04:57:34 My.02  US futures are green for first time in 3 days . SPY/Nasdaq green during and after Trump speech. Stocks will probably rally on Wed. Fed-FOMC eventual, inactive (No rate hike till march!!!)n
2706 2018-01-31 04:57:14 Private prison stocks skyrocketed on Trump's election because of his scapegoating of immigrants.  We can deport the violent without demonizing all of them.
2707 2018-01-31 04:57:13 10. drilling along all our coasts--destroying tourism, but worse, destroying our homes, our country. We MUST fight. Only 10% of Americans own stocks to the extent they are benefitting now. Wages matter more. Income inequality threatens our economy, yet Rs ignore warnings as old
2708 2018-01-31 04:56:49 Look I'll a devise you like Army always do when y'all try something stupid again and again y'all need to calm your egg brain down & learn more about stocks and Apps it's an app & I can assure you it'll go down faster than the Korean billboard idea  bc SM can't create only buys
2709 2018-01-31 04:56:26 Next time you hear Trump boast about the stock market as he seeks big praise, remember that 84% of all stocks belong to just 10% of the population. So he’s simply helping his rich friends. #SOTU #ImpeachTheShithole
2710 2018-01-31 04:55:26 difference in investing in penny stocks (crypto currency) and investing in the S&P 500, Volatility. Where does the value lie? what do Crypto Currencies provide? A store of value? No,Ask someone who bought bit coin at $18,000 or $1000. Investment? Penny stocks are less volatile.
2711 2018-01-31 04:55:08 Not too mention the percentage of Middle Class who don't speculate in stocks!

1) the infrastructure is stable, 
2) there are useful applications running on the blockchain,
3) people are using crypto for p2p transactions, not as stocks
2717 2018-01-31 04:50:54 I'm genuinely surprised how these people don't know about stocks and shareholders. If you're working with a business you have to know.

2719 2018-01-31 04:49:10 Rephrase: there is no intrinsic value to crypto currency, no backing, it’s as good as an investment as penny stocks due to its crazy volatility. It’s the modern day beanie babies. The USD is the official currency of the US, it has value because of this. Common sense 101 ahem....

2729 2018-01-31 04:45:10 Chuck Schumer needs to recheck his numbers. On the eve of Trump’s election when they thought Hillary would win, the stock markets tanked. After Trump won stocks soared and haven’t stopped. #MAGA

2760 2018-01-31 04:32:33 I'm guessing you think the stock market doing well is a reflection on the economy, right?

How many stocks do you own? How many do you think middle class citizens as a whole own? When the stock market does well that means the rich are getting richer.
2761 2018-01-31 04:32:02 Rich Dems dump stocks to embarrass POTUS!!! Sick game plan!!!
2762 2018-01-31 04:31:39 .@KamalaHarris on @CNN lied tonight when she said only 10% of Americans own stocks. Truth is 89% have either a 401k or IRA or pension. This is why @realDonaldTrump is calling out Fake News. Wait for @Morning_Joe to repeat the lie tomorrow.
2763 2018-01-31 04:31:16 Democrats are so spiteful they would cut off their nose to spite their face & that is what they’re doing,inside they are so happy their stocks are doing great their jobs are wonderful there getting raises unemployment is down everyone will be getting bigger paychecks, 
2764 2018-01-31 04:31:01 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
2765 2018-01-31 04:30:44 I'm not gonna argue about a fake thing cuz it'd never end. If you want ground floor, crazy potential and are willing to waste money on a fake thing, thenI'd advise invest in pot stocks. Bigger/faster/real growth faster than the internet boom of the 90's. Facts.
2766 2018-01-31 04:30:17 with just that ONE stock, MAYBE (big news and uplist announcement this week). But combined in other stocks I’ve invested in, absolutely
2767 2018-01-31 04:30:10 BRAZIL /EWZ STOCKS ARE THE STRONGEST NAMES ON THE WATCHILIST.
2768 2018-01-31 04:29:37 I rlly like those suppliers who give you private sales and also update you on whether they are still bringing in the stocks. Can’t believe my supplier is making me buy all of the stocks 
2769 2018-01-31 04:29:28 Whats the criteria for breakout stocks ?
2770 2018-01-31 04:29:18 If midcap falls another 10% I would sell my house to buy few good stocks :) . Some are juicy attractive for a 2 year target .
2771 2018-01-31 04:29:13 everything moves according to their charts.
even nifty and bank nifty...
see the nifty chart and trade nifty. dont see other stocks to trade index.
see the individual charts and trade individuals. not the index and trade individuals.
2772 2018-01-31 04:28:46 If I hear @realDonaldTrump brag about the stock market one more time. UGH. Thanks Obama. But only 54% of America own stocks. So the great stock market only make the rich richer!
2773 2018-01-31 04:28:39 Long-term Capital Gain Tax May Make come back on Listed Stocks in this #revenuebudget  if this is introduces in the #BudgetSession2018 then will see huge down fall in the #stockmarket #Nifty
2774 2018-01-31 04:28:35 Yeah and some people have gained 24% this year in their retirement via stocks and bonds. So Elizabeth is pretty much spewing garbage
2775 2018-01-31 04:28:16 That wasn't their only accomplishment. Historical lows in unemployment in all ethnicities, many federal judge positions filled, unnecessary  regulations slashed, CHIP funded, border wall prototypes made/tested, Isis on the run, home sales up, individual mandate gone, stocks up...
2776 2018-01-31 04:26:24 @MaggieJordanACN my stocks are crazy great and my job is great cause I got a 3g bonus cause of TRUMP you got be happy your bosses gave you one too, They did give you one dident they???hmm I hope so Apple is investing %)) billion back the US u did hear that right I'm so happy
2777 2018-01-31 04:26:16 People that have turned their nose to cryptos will get the itch to sell a few stock shares and try out BTC so they can say they own some. Then they will get addicted like the rest of us. Robinhood will make it easy Housing stocks and cryptos under the same roof.

2782 2018-01-31 04:25:05 @SenKamalaHarris said 85% of stocks are owned by 10% of our population. If this is true shouldn’t we encourage everyone to trust the markets and become shareholders in companies. Buy stocks people, so you too can become a bigger part economic prosperity in our country. #sotu

2786 2018-01-31 04:23:58 1. Low black unemployment like, “See this proves I’m not racist. “ 
2.4M jobs the slowest pace in jobs in the last 7 years. 
3. No collision claims doesn’t mean there wasn’t collusion or obstruction of justice. 
4. Only half of Americans own stocks - includes 401k 
#TrumpLies
2787 2018-01-31 04:23:39 @KamalaHarris  Although 80 pct of the stock is owned by 10 pct of the people, when stocks are strong and company CEO’s are happy it rolls down to workers like myself a middle class American in the form of overtime pay, bonuses and profit sharing.

2791 2018-01-31 04:21:43 "84% of the stocks in America are owned by 10% of the public"~Kamala Harris ....wow
2792 2018-01-31 04:21:27 Did I just hear @SenKamalaHarris say that 84% of stocks are held by 10% of America? I am so dumb. Still.
2793 2018-01-31 04:21:15 Izek down, baron in the stocks, baroness and Uno (or whatever his name is) deposited at the church; giant angry tiger returned to his half elf. Second half of the evening: Lady Watcher and her followers.  Busy night.

2804 2018-01-31 04:17:50 Well mid February is 2 weeks away. Where you going to make 10-100x profit in stocks in that time frame? Lmao!
2805 2018-01-31 04:17:31 Attention, those on the left of the aisle- Bernie Sanders and his followers don't want your vote if you've invested in pharma stocks. Considering most retirement funds have some investment in pharma or medical related services  products, you're disqualified from the Berner camp.
2806 2018-01-31 04:17:29 The top 10% of American households, as defined by total wealth, now own 84% of all stocks in 2016, according to a recent paper by NYU economist Edward N. Wolff.
2807 2018-01-31 04:16:59 #SOTU Not true that we are doing so much better with Trump. 84% stocks belong to 10% of Americans. So when you see the stock market rise it's not helping most Americans!
2808 2018-01-31 04:16:54 I’m a big time trader on ZSE. I hope u understand how things hv responded there.

2845 2018-01-31 04:02:08 Why do we measure how the economy is doing by the stock market anyway? Shit. Dow could be up to 30k and folks still broke. Stocks don't mean shit to folks struggling to make a buck.

2893 2018-01-31 03:46:16 Funny to listen to Kennedy try to explain the down side of booming stocks, booming economy, higher wages and low unemployment.
2894 2018-01-31 03:46:12 Dem response: many have spent last year anxious, angry, afraid.  We all feel fractured fault lines across country.  We see stocks surge, but everyday people struggling. Government struggling to stay open.  #SOTUresponse
2895 2018-01-31 03:45:59 Completely forgot about this twitter, feel free to unfollow this if you're still following about stocks. I'm using this as my personal one now.
2896 2018-01-31 03:45:43 I would hope so.  Investing in stocks would done that.
2897 2018-01-31 03:45:36 Kennedy: The people here are tough, a fitting place to gather as we reflect on the state of our Union. We all feel the fractured fault lines. Economy makes stocks soar, but families don't feel it #sotu #OutandAboutNashvillepolitics

2906 2018-01-31 03:42:50 Yep, bump stocks are just a way to waste ammo.

2922 2018-01-31 03:34:01 Here’s the difference, passing a budget makes it his economy. Acting hostile to allies we trade with and indirectly causing company stocks to crash puts the blame on him, and the economy still wouldn’t be his. See how that works?

2932 2018-01-31 03:29:59 Don't worry. A company who don't have the guts to reveal their stocks in public would never be part of Big3. Try to understand the irony of this situation dumb beggers. Bighit is under SM now since SM basically owns SK telecom and bighit has zero shares lmfao

2956 2018-01-31 03:17:44 My question exactly. Daily mass murders. Did not outlaw bump stocks? The shooting here in Vegas, two weeks in the news. Now they barely get a mention and nothing from him. Doesn't fit his narrative.
2957 2018-01-31 03:17:11 No, they won't and they can't. SM stocks is go public, which is everyone can see that. So it's impossible to do Sajaegi. And why they must do sajaegi if we can afford to buy album. Remember that we are Quadruple million seller. Lol hahaha
2958 2018-01-31 03:16:40 Yes, I did mean February $1,210 calls! Exactly - the trader wants to collect a good premium from being short those Feb $1,210 calls, but wants to be long by owning the May $1,300 calls.
2959 2018-01-31 03:15:00 Just finished journaling my trades. Learned you can do everything right but the stock will take its own time. My entries were good but stopped out on pull backs.

2970 2018-01-31 03:12:06 I will admit — this is/has always been the one issue that I care most about. Stocks went down today because Wall Street is getting worried about higher interest rates. Just think what we’ll have to pay in federal debt servicing with a 1% increase in rates.

3002 2018-01-31 03:05:49 bc the rest of the stock will be divided between a lot of people. But if another company suddenly decides to go after all these individuals and/or companies that own tiny bits of % of your stocks and start accumulating them, they can take over
3003 2018-01-31 03:05:48 So you don't have a 401k? Or own stocks? You should probably get on that Karen

hurry, stocks are limited
3012 2018-01-31 03:04:27 because like, if your company had 100 stocks and you owned 52, you have 52% percent of the company. But suddenly you want money, so you issue 100 more stock. Now your company has 200 stocks and if you only own 52 you now have 21% of the company. that usually is not a big deal+

3023 2018-01-31 03:01:49 I'm not. My 401k and stocks are doing magnificent. Same for a large number of Americans
3024 2018-01-31 03:01:43 Watch Friday, February 16th in the Stock market.
Quite a few US and Oz Stocks with 144 cycle completions.
3025 2018-01-31 03:01:26 Do you spew the same nonsense about stocks?
3026 2018-01-31 03:01:19 Lol at liberal hysteria.  Pharma stocks gonna fly with record sales of xanax

3030 2018-01-31 03:00:04 Tax reform, Black unemployment at an all time low (he’s such a racist), travel ban has actually done very good things for the country, getting out of the trans-pacific partnership, If you know what it was? The economy is booming in growths in the stocks and jobs created. If you
3031 2018-01-31 02:59:48 No, we want action on gun control. Ban on bump stocks?
3032 2018-01-31 02:59:34 After cruising through social media, I have realized that If the "F" word were a stock, it would be considered "Bullish". Anyone wants to become an overnight millionaire? #SOTU #stocks #WallStreet
3033 2018-01-31 02:59:28 The real State of the Union:

Millennials can’t afford homes. 

Hold crippling student debt. 

Are bankrupted by medical bills.

Stocks are hyper inflated beyond values.

40% of Americans have zero savings.

2008 crash was basically foreplay.

3035 2018-01-31 02:59:27 Pharma stocks dragged Dow jones down last night at least. Let’s see how it pans out! :)
3036 2018-01-31 02:59:06 Glad you liked the chart of the day & the top 5 EPS #stocks @Linda_ST_PT $INTC had a nice breakout on Friday in a market big down day on Tuesday volume was lower than the breakout. Have a wonderful day.
3037 2018-01-31 02:58:50 That's why majority of us boycotted him! Stocks dropped over 500 points in two days if trading. He tout his lost its doing, Or spin the opposite? Like I even have to ask!
3038 2018-01-31 02:58:32 @Tesla if @elonmusk starts his own crypto currency that determines its value like current Tesla stocks I am all in on that ! Lol cha Ching ! 
3039 2018-01-31 02:58:26 Unsure if Indian Healthcare stocks will benefit or get bambooed when Amazon, JP Morgan and Berkshire tie up to bring down healthcare costs in USA.
3040 2018-01-31 02:57:53 Buffet has supported single payer. After today’s announcement, health insurer & pharma stocks fell. 

If that cuts insur. & pharma campaign contributions, Bernie’s Medicare for All has a better chance.

Dems could have expanded Medicare in 2009. Let’s see if they blow it again!
3041 2018-01-31 02:57:28 Stocks in the news: ICICI Bank, L&T, Idea Cellular, JK Paper, Syndicate Bank, NCC, Bajaj Auto, M&M.
3042 2018-01-31 02:57:24 Both Exxon Mobil and Apple stocks were going down past week...I bet tomorrow both go up #StateofOurUnion
3043 2018-01-31 02:57:14 So he's banning bump stocks?
3044 2018-01-31 02:57:12 U know its a bad day when u go to 3 diff shop and all same type of bread u looking for are out of stocks 
3045 2018-01-31 02:57:12 my stocks going up..
3046 2018-01-31 02:56:47 Why does Trump always imply the only savage criminals are illegal immigrants? Most of these crimes are committed by U.S. citizens, the majority of whom are white. When he speaks about closing deadly loopholes, he should start with assault rifles and bump stocks! @manonbanta 
3047 2018-01-31 02:56:47 I hear you and why I prefer it only as a short term swing trade when I see it looking favorable, based on the technicals. That being said I understood $NFLX years back but at these levels? The good news is that there are plenty of other good stocks to take advantage of.
3048 2018-01-31 02:56:08 Ummm Nancy, companies don't give pensions anymore. 401K = stocks.  Stocks up, retirement savings goes up.
3049 2018-01-31 02:55:22 For Friday 1/26, I did not catch any notable trades. On 1/25, a trader sold 3,000 February $210 calls and bought 3,000 May $1300 calls...that was an interesting trade. I am inclined to go long & I think it makes sense to consider a call spread that has a few months to play out.
3050 2018-01-31 02:55:03 Can I see a graphic: murders by white dudes with bump stocks v ms13 in the US?
3051 2018-01-31 02:54:48 Oh, shut the fuck up about how sad you are about those poor girls' murder, as if you're using it for anything other than to advance your racist agenda. Bump stocks are still legal. There are no universal background checks. The gun show loophole is still there. #SOTU
3052 2018-01-31 02:54:48 Stocks were stupid red today on Trump's #SOTU2018 lmao
3053 2018-01-31 02:54:45 i guess some form of overseeing will be able to other companies sharing stocks in terms of album sales. And vice versa. Depends on who is the largest stockholder.
3054 2018-01-31 02:54:39 Is deals have make my stocks go up! Obama did nothing for my stocks in 8yrs.
3055 2018-01-31 02:54:30 Stocks, real estate , annuities, even purchasing franchised stores, mostly real estate though , and if at any point I get lost , I’d be able to afford to hire somebody to help In my decision making
3056 2018-01-31 02:54:29 Can we also address the loopholes that allow crazy white men to buy semi automatic weapons or bump stocks that allow them to murder dozens of people in just minutes??? #SOTU
3057 2018-01-31 02:54:13 Regardless of who is responsible, black leaders should still be happy.
3058 2018-01-31 02:53:50 so...how many undocumented residents killed people last year?  And how many people did that American citizen kill in Vegas a three months ago? And have we banned bump stocks yet? or done anything on that issue at all?
3059 2018-01-31 02:53:22 Seeing so many tweets "Buy this DIP", "Buy this DIP", "Buy this DIP". I would say time for cautious in choosing stocks, last 2 years even monkey/darts were able to pick up 5-10x baggers, otherwise it can be "Bye Bye DIP".
3060 2018-01-31 02:53:16 Sir please guide which are the stocks in irrigation and agrochemicals which are fundamentally strong n going to benefit from Govt incentives, if any
3061 2018-01-31 02:52:49 Invest more in infrastructure stocks I know I am Niel
3062 2018-01-31 02:52:26 Indivisible #IndivisibleSOTU If illegal MI13 kills, must all DACA kids suffer?  What about the thousands of Americans killed by Americans each year?  Automatic weapons and bump stocks are still legal to purchase.
3063 2018-01-31 02:52:03 Getting rid of the mandate was all he needed to do & the market will find a way. It might take 10 years to get there but just let the market figure it out. Already u see Amazon & others coming up w/ options & people bailing on insurance stocks
3064 2018-01-31 02:51:59 So we’re buying coal stocks and shorting Pharma stocks, so far.

3066 2018-01-31 02:51:38 They are not investing $350 B in the US. They are bringing cash back stateside and some of it may be invested. Rest will likely buy stocks (maybe even Tesla).
3067 2018-01-31 02:51:37 Are you serious? I mean anybody with a backdrop on twitter with a flying fat guy can't be taken seriously. Stocks are up,jobs are coming back,illegal rapist & murders going to jail and you have the Gaul to make a statement like that...were are you from?
3068 2018-01-31 02:51:34 What about getting rid of bump stocks?  Or do we just do nothing whenever 58 people are killed in a mass shooting. #cbssotu
3069 2018-01-31 02:51:06 Bezos-Buffett-Dimon: "We just knocked 2% out of healthcare stocks!"

3071 2018-01-31 02:50:47 No wonder Healthcare stocks tanked today? Who had inside information?
3072 2018-01-31 02:50:45 In today's fall look for midcaps and small caps that stay steady to strong. Track such stocks in agrochemicals, seeds, irrigation sectors.
3073 2018-01-31 02:50:18 Quantum Tax Saving. I am biased so take your call. I just believe at all times they hold only undervalued stocks, that makes me comfortable recommending it to people

3077 2018-01-31 02:49:36 Is not about"American racism", Viceroy is looking to short (sell) the stocks profiting from a declining share price of capitec, is all about business.
3078 2018-01-31 02:49:06 The richest 10% in the US own 81% of stocks.

3082 2018-01-31 02:48:37 Every time @realDonaldTrump tweets about the stock market, remember that 50% of Americans aren't in the market (and 80% of all stocks are owned by the richest 10%). Our national problem isn't insufficient wealth: It's immoral distribution.

3101 2018-01-31 02:43:35 Bump stocks look like a hell of a lot of fun for recreation for responsible folks, just like alcohol is. Alcohol though is not a constitutional right. RT @joshgreenman: “…doing nothing at all to ban bump stocks after worst mass murder in American history

Some can say that growth and stocks help the welfare of its citizens, but I think it should be: Citizens 1, $$$ 2. #apmrj

3164 2018-01-31 02:34:30 BUMP STOCKS ARE NOT IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT. NO WHERE IS A BUMP STOCK IN THE FUCKING SECOND FUCKING AMENDMENT. #SOTU
3165 2018-01-31 02:34:21 "We are totally defending our 2nd Amendment."
Then why is your ATF trying to ban bump stocks, @realDonaldTrump? #SOTU2018 #SOTU
3166 2018-01-31 02:34:18 luv the second amendment name check because a world without bump stocks is a world not living in.
3167 2018-01-31 02:33:33 So true, they are using the tax breaks to buy back their stocks, not help ppl.
3168 2018-01-31 02:33:27 "In Trump's first year, stocks soar for rich, but wages stay flat". Can't forget that, either. We're all anxious for those corporate stock buy-backs #INDems #SOTU #IN05
3169 2018-01-31 02:32:49 What's this fantasy/Sci-fi program that's on all the TV stations? Taking credit for economic gains he'd nothing to do with is vomitus at best. What about the Stock Market growth? Well if I was given carte blanche to fuck ppl over for profit my stocks would grow too.
3170 2018-01-31 02:31:40 'Down' syndrome at play. Beware of Indian stocks crashing Down.
3171 2018-01-31 02:31:30 I might just need to buy some stocks
3172 2018-01-31 02:31:16 What they object to is this administration taking credit. 
- no real wage growth
- job creation is less in 2017 than in 2016 and 2015
- the stock market continues at the same rate and 85% of stocks are owned by the top 10%
- the tax cut benefits the top 1% and corporations

3178 2018-01-31 02:29:49 1/ Donald Trump touts that this is the moment for the American Dream, but neglects to mention his dream is of a soaring stock market. 80% of stock market wealth is owned by the richest 10%, while half of all Americans do not own stocks. #StateOfTheDream #SOTU #StateOfTheUnion
3179 2018-01-31 02:29:48 You have to have a job and pay taxes to have them cut. Btw, how's your 401k and stocks holding? Ahh yes, you have none  guess he's not helping you. And mine went down in value the past 2 days so I really don't like him now
3180 2018-01-31 02:29:41 BWAHHAAA . Yeah right, Obama is gone. Economy, jobs, stocks all up. President Trump did it. Many blacks love this guy. Hmmm? Racist? Why you hating? Better get on board
3181 2018-01-31 02:29:30 A mere 10% of Americans own more than 80% of American stocks.

3183 2018-01-31 02:29:26 Lemme get this straight. They’re applauding people who survived or aided gun violence instead of making a difference and repealing bump stocks or selling to the mentally ill. Way to go @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @WhiteHouse #gagginghere
3184 2018-01-31 02:29:19 Or the unemployment line.. Some corporations used it to buy up stocks in their own companies..
3185 2018-01-31 02:29:12 Economy is up, 401ks are up, stocks are up, and taxes are down. Doesn’t get much greater!
3186 2018-01-31 02:28:45 the better economic brag is wages and company expansions than the stock market tbh, how many people own stocks?
3187 2018-01-31 02:28:39 Regarding stocks:   They should be booming w/ anticipation of massively increased corporate welfare benefits w/ assurance industries will be able to dump wastes into the environment much more freely.   Giving rich public wealth, resources, killing efforts to keep environment safe
3188 2018-01-31 02:28:35 No stocks used!
3189 2018-01-31 02:28:10 Most of us don't have stocks. We rely on change from under the couch cushions
3190 2018-01-31 02:28:06 Thanks Scottie!  My stocks are rocking, too!!
3191 2018-01-31 02:28:03 And laying off their workers while executing corporate buybacks (did I word that right?) of their own stocks
3192 2018-01-31 02:27:59 It’s the global economy pushing stocks higher.  He is a foolish man the bond market is dropping there is a cautious attitude right now he should listen to Tom Keen
3193 2018-01-31 02:27:26 The Richest 10% of Americans Now Own 84% of All Stocks #taxcuts #TaxReform #SOTU The rich gets RICHER!

3196 2018-01-31 02:26:46 the market manipulation is incredibly impressive
when you look at how high equities aka stocks
have sky rocketed but commodity prices have
stayed semi sane.
3197 2018-01-31 02:26:35 Fire all of the people in DC. They have all failed regular Americans.  Yep the stocks are up. But the regular people are going to suffer.  #StateofOurUnion
3198 2018-01-31 02:26:32 good thing they cap income taxes around $150-250k, eh?  You can hold stocks in TFSA, too!  Minwage exists because politicians dupe citizens by positioning it's potential benefits, and ignoring it's documented downsides.
3199 2018-01-31 02:26:21 One of the best ways to react during such times is to not look at markets for next 15 days (unless u don't want to invest and average out on good stocks)
3200 2018-01-31 02:26:09 Stocks are up cuz they got the tax money.
3201 2018-01-31 02:24:51 Only about 52 of all Americans own any stocks at all. #SOTU @ceprdc

3206 2018-01-31 02:24:01 Trump has already created 2.4 million jobs since he's became president, stocks are growing, biggest tax cuts and reforms in history, doubled standard deduction for everyone, doubled child tax credit, & so much more. Bet no one knew that did you

3210 2018-01-31 02:23:07 Hey, @realDonaldTrump : Stocks dropped sharply on Tuesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled by 362 points.
3211 2018-01-31 02:22:58 Stock market is one indication of economic health. What about folks who don't own stocks? #ecusotu #CLDEsotu
3212 2018-01-31 02:22:56 Don’t brag too much @realDonaldTrump, you could easily be Bush in 2006 right now. Oh and only half of Americans own stocks or have investments in the stock market #StateOfTheUniom
3213 2018-01-31 02:22:45 just saying you can talk about low unemployment and the stock market being high all you want, but most Americans aren’t rich people who have stocks and they struggle even with jobs to survive. And that’s assuming they don’t have any emergencies that need them to spend a lot of $$
3214 2018-01-31 02:22:39 I don’t give a fuck about how the stock market is doing when 91% of stocks are owned by the 1% and 40 million Americans are living in poverty. #sotu
3215 2018-01-31 02:22:29 Dear @realDonaldTrump please make my stocks and options go up, so I can retire before your term is up.

3220 2018-01-31 02:22:07 Nearly half of Americans don't own stocks directly or in 401(k)s. Run-up of the stock market enriches same people that benefited most from the tax cuts.

3228 2018-01-31 02:21:24 .@realDonaldTrump do I look like I care about the stock market? do I look like I own stocks? My 2004 corolla will tell you that the answer to both is NO

3257 2018-01-31 02:15:00 I remember when you called it and said he would win the Republican nomination and the Presidency and everyone laughed at you.  Can you recommend any good stocks?! Lol
3258 2018-01-31 02:14:58 It can be a good idea to protect against a market pullback, similar to what we saw today in the US. For example, you may own calls in several stocks but also own SPY puts to protect yourself if the market goes down. Overall, traders still seem to be buying calls in SPY and QQQ.
3259 2018-01-31 02:14:50 Yes bare minimum, Highest Stocks, lowest unemployment for the Black community, Lower Taxes,  Bringing back business.  Not perfect, but better then the last President.
3260 2018-01-31 02:14:46 Anyone got any good stocks to buy via shares ? Not options
3261 2018-01-31 02:14:30 BUMP stocks for all!!
3262 2018-01-31 02:13:12 What challenge could he not imagine? Oh yeah, climate change! Bump stocks!
3263 2018-01-31 02:12:54 Stocks a great coach he’s prepared you well!
3264 2018-01-31 02:12:49 Great question - big firms and institutions do hedge (protect their bullish positions) by buying puts in ETFs such as SPY and QQQ. As of right now, I am only focusing on individual stocks, not SPY or QQQ. It is not complex to trade those ETFs - you buy calls & puts like normal.
3265 2018-01-31 02:10:52 If I charged 2% & bought the  20 largest stocks at the start of each year, I’d beat the market as they are the market. Massive hindsight bias, availability Heuristic, however, that’s human nature to chase what looks easy.

3272 2018-01-31 02:08:24 But wouldn't you expect that in a heavily weighted stock in a 30 stock basket over any three stocks in a 500 group basket? It's got to be close the majority of the time. Right?
3273 2018-01-31 02:07:12 Don’t be hateful of great Americans who are benefiting greatly from Trump.   Stocks under Obama rebounded from recession lows didn’t soar to new highs like under Trump
3274 2018-01-31 02:07:10 Trump will talk about the stock market. Half of Americans don't own a dollar of stock.  And 10% of Americans own 80% of stocks.  The stock market doing well, without indication that wages are increasing also, is merely a sign of wealth concentrating in the capital class.
3275 2018-01-31 02:06:23 Sort of. The money flows clearly show passive is becoming the dominant trade, per the huge inflow in ETF’s, massive out flows of active. The low fees don’t make as big a difference when the majority automatically bid up the price of the largest stocks.
3276 2018-01-31 02:06:15 #SOTU

3296 2018-01-31 01:59:00 Yes - Sam stocks the map.
3297 2018-01-31 01:57:11 Yeah, fuck economic policy that invests in things like healthcare, education, and infrastructure to make American workers competitive with the rest of the world. Huge corporations need that money to buy their own stocks instead!
3298 2018-01-31 01:56:39 So many of my stocks are now in the red, yet I look at each of them, see their fundamentals are rock solid & they were already undervalued when I bought.  My entry timing obviously wasn't perfect, but now I just have to be patient :)
3299 2018-01-31 01:56:12 1.5% out of primarily health stocks.... not worthy of note.
3300 2018-01-31 01:55:56 Wait...I thought republicans liked guns.  Scalise was okay with it.  Has no interest in banning bump stocks, so what is your gripe?
3301 2018-01-31 01:54:46 Good thing I have a longer investment time frame than 1 month and I don’t invest based on a stocks 1 month past performance
3302 2018-01-31 01:53:45 Your tweets are always on the point - in today’s massacre - there were some older guards like RTI which held its forte pretty decently....what’s your take on such stocks that weathered this blitz better than others?
3303 2018-01-31 01:53:13 @GOP lackeys bringing up bonus checks as Trump revitalizing the economy. I have a bonus from my employer but it’s a ruse. Corporations give a bonus which is pennies on the dollar rather than provide better wages & use the rest to buy back stocks & enrich themselves not America.
3304 2018-01-31 01:52:58 Early release? My hypothesis:
1) It’s first month of the year (history says during this month all coins are in low price)
2) CNE(Chinese New Year Event) is coming, chinese people pulling out their stocks/coin from the market the buy gift for their loved ones, new house sometimes

3311 2018-01-31 01:50:22 January 31, 2018: As of 9:45 a.m., PSEi 8,767.34 down 143.14 points or 1.61 percent. PSEi opened at 8,831.83. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3312 2018-01-31 01:50:04 It was George HW Bush who told Hussein it was okay to side-drill into Kuwait to steal their oil and once Hussein did that, George HW Bush invaded Iraq. That's how I remember it. Pelosi most likely made money on stocks from that invasion.
3313 2018-01-31 01:48:37 One whom'st meditate the going to steal the declaration of independence stocks .   
3314 2018-01-31 01:48:24 Why would someone that has little money for food and rent care that the stock market is doing good? They don't buy stocks they are trying to be eggs.

3317 2018-01-31 01:46:58 C'mon, Jonas, keep it civil. Not drinking anything. Give credit where credit is due.  Current upswing is because the 1% have 100% assurance in this administration because they are getting everything they want.  That influences stocks. GOP supports business over middle class
3318 2018-01-31 01:46:29 I agree and have been saying this for months in an aurora FB group. I got lit up as well. There is lot of speculation in this space and the stocks are way overvalued. Unfortunately lots of ppl are going to loose money.
3319 2018-01-31 01:45:54 We can't even get bump stocks banned. You think a gun-control law that would confiscate firearms from legal gun owners because the govt says they're irresponsible is getting passed anytime soon?

3321 2018-01-31 01:43:44 That $20 a paycheck makes no difference when insurance premiums have increased, inflation and interest rates have risen, people are being laid off, and plants are closing. And the past few days, stocks are way down.  Wake up!

3323 2018-01-31 01:42:33 I get it, but how do retailers ever compete to offer he same experience if their stocks are punished for investment?
3324 2018-01-31 01:41:26 Right and I buy stocks because I’m really hoping someone will buy it back at a lower price
3325 2018-01-31 01:41:25 Things I'm looking out for in this SOTU: 
- @TheOnion's coverage
- What the stocks look like during/immediately after
3326 2018-01-31 01:41:22 I heard this & was stunned...The stocks of major insurers dropped today after the announcement but Amazon stock tweaked up...it's all about the money
3327 2018-01-31 01:40:30 #SEC needs to look into this ASAP - if these people did short the stocks with this news story - it is time to take control before these idiots bring our country down.
3328 2018-01-31 01:39:53 In time they will yes, but they have a ways to come back. The best advice is never try to pick bottoms....wait until you see an established trend in place. Buy when everyone is selling & sell when everyone's buying. Environmental & renewable energy stocks as well.
3329 2018-01-31 01:39:36 The economy is doing well for some people in SOME cities, NOT across America.
The stock market is up, but half of America doesn't own stocks.
The state of the economy is the same.

3332 2018-01-31 01:39:03 Yes, we area appalled at your rhetoric and partisan stance.

3342 2018-01-31 01:34:20 $CELG - this thing trading under 8x 2020 EPS...that's typically the price where "patent cliff" pharma stocks bottom out.
3343 2018-01-31 01:34:06 Selling across stocks, oil, & bonds overnight. I think we needed corrections (i know its only been 2 days down !) in this incredible bull market to keep it real ! #Markets #stocks
3344 2018-01-31 01:33:03 Seriously, Linden and Benning need to go. This will be yet another embarrassing trade deadline for them if they don't trade Guddy and Vanek. Laughing stocks again this time of year.
3345 2018-01-31 01:33:02 Tech stocks in 1999, real estate in 2008, cryptocurrencies in 2018; it seems investors need a good beating once a decade to remember the road to riches is a slow and boring marathon and not an adrenaline-inducing sprint. "This time is different" is code for "stop and hire a pro."
3346 2018-01-31 01:32:59 the health insurance stocks certainly weren't all that amused...too bad.
3347 2018-01-31 01:30:20 Someone shorting healthcare stocks before announcement? ;-)

3349 2018-01-31 01:29:38 Some stocks were already cheap or near lows and with the panic selling on some has provided an opportunity to buy cheaply. Even revenue earning stocks with great FA. Li market might steady a bit but it certainly ain't ever going away imo!
3350 2018-01-31 01:29:22 Schumer is so stupid.  We had the worst economy ever under Obama.  Also stocks soared due to tax breaks and companies coming back to US because of President Trump.

3354 2018-01-31 01:28:23 There is a bubble market for the stocks and real estate. That won't end well. Government debt in the USA and Canada is very high. This means major interest charges and deferred payments for our kids. Not good. @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer @RachelNotley @jkenney I see recession.
3355 2018-01-31 01:26:06 Well that’s good for some Americans. Most of us though don’t have stocks, don’t own corporations, and don’t need the estate tax lifted. This tax cut was aimed at the top 1% of Americans.
3356 2018-01-31 01:24:46 Don’t fall for the “booming” economy BS during #SOTU:

Stock market highs are largely driven by corporations buying back their own shares

10% of households own 84% of all stocks

5+ million Americans live in absolute poverty

Real wages for workers have barely budged for decades
3357 2018-01-31 01:23:24 Very true. Good opportunities to add cheapily or buy new stocks on the cheap also.

3371 2018-01-31 01:16:43 Crypto is dropping because the stock market entered a mania bull run, crypto has a higher risk % than stocks atm, any sane hedge fund already has its stack in the stock market since last month
3372 2018-01-31 01:16:42 "They declined to say if she had any ethics training." This is more disturbing than the choice of stocks. I learned about financial conflict of interest in a community college clinical trials certificate course!!!

3376 2018-01-31 01:15:09 Only 4% of all publicly traded #stocks account for all of the net #wealth earned by #investors in the stock market since 1926. A mere 30 stocks account for 30% of the net wealth generated by stocks in that long period, and 50 stocks account for 40% of the net wealth. #finance

3379 2018-01-31 01:14:13 In the two hours before the #SOTU, @politico breaks a story about the CDC Director trading tobacco stocks while in office, @thedailybeast reports that Nunes won't say if he worked with the WH on his memo. This is the Trump era. So much malfeasance it all becomes white noise.

3381 2018-01-31 01:13:47 Historically speaking, we are due for a major market correction. Stocks are highly over valued globally. The tax reform bill has boosted them even higher in recent weeks, but also sets up for a big sell off.  It’s coming.
3382 2018-01-31 01:13:32 How insular and idiotic does one have to be to recycle this garbage that a Wharton billionaire who got rich making the most tangible asset imaginable, not stocks, is driven to avenge minor slights, merely because he may have mentioned it to someone once.

3389 2018-01-31 01:10:00 Stocks that were falling hard were of corporations doing healthcare insurance business.

Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan saying they want in on that business has them shook as they could grab so much business from old cats. Whom now insure workers of new comers.

3397 2018-01-31 01:06:05 No investment is foolproof - whether you invest in stocks, real estate, collectibles or cash investments, all have up and down markets. It is important to fully understand everything you invest in and focus on assets that will make money over the long haul.
3398 2018-01-31 01:05:52 Bad timing for Trump as stocks have plummeted the last two days.

3407 2018-01-31 01:01:36 Would likely be very bullish for the US economy & US stocks; the USD not so much.  The days of "goods for UST's" free trade may be ending, replaced by "goods for goods" trade.

3410 2018-01-31 01:00:49 Unfortunately it was a missed opportunity for another lie from Democrats. Americans own stocks and the retirement relies on it. Stupid people don't understand that simple point.
3411 2018-01-31 01:00:03 I agree with Rush Limbaugh. 
#Democrats dumped their stocks today before the #SOTU  to screw with #Potus and his success in #MAGA.
3412 2018-01-31 00:59:19 Go lower the stocks.

3420 2018-01-31 00:55:54 Who cares.  Owning stocks is not being a distributor.  Great dividends, everyone should own some.
3421 2018-01-31 00:54:46 Ed. Come on man!!!! Our country is a big business, a corporation, like it or not. We have to financially succeed. Obama had 8 years. 8 years and look at he GDP. Democrats said if trump won the stocks would collapse. The day he won we were open for business again brother.

3423 2018-01-31 00:52:48 They will blame it on pizza gate on Mars. So many redneck trumpsters have been praising Trump for the rising stock market, but I guarantee none of those right wing nutjobs even have any stocks, lol

3425 2018-01-31 00:52:40 PM Mkt Wrap: Bond mkt ends session @ $101.97, -6bps. DowJ  fell 362.59 to 26,076.89. Normally when stocks fall like today that is a real boost for bonds sbd homeloan rates, but not today!!! #BetterCallGreg
3426 2018-01-31 00:51:01 What does Obama have to do with the unpopular president?  Did we change topics. Stocks r up! Y.  How many people really have stock? I have no better refund, sorry, my 401 is fine, not better or worse. But money is all u speak of, pride, compassion, trust, guess no value there. 
3427 2018-01-31 00:50:51 Intersting to see what the oil and oil service stocks do. They did not participate fully during the move higher.

3429 2018-01-31 00:49:41 The sell-off today in healthcare stocks because of the Amazon-Berkshire Hathaway-JP Morgan news, was way overdone. 

It will be a while before anything substantial comes from that partnership.  Nice buying opportunity in $UNH, $ANTM, $AET, $CI, $HUM
3430 2018-01-31 00:48:45 If he didn't have a personal fortune over 50 million with most of that invested in military, healthcare and pharma stocks I might almost believe him.

3433 2018-01-31 00:47:45 #StateofOurUnion Unless you are invested in stocks, you still gain nothing in this economy. 
Look at the empty commercial space in the strip mall and that tells you the recession recovery is still slow. 
DT has isolated the US out of all major modern western trade -

3439 2018-01-31 00:46:04 You weren’t the only jackass in the room. Being relatively new I try to handle no more than 2 stocks at a time. Picked the worse 2 off the list today. Tried shorting $ALV & $CNC. Got in $ALV @ 106.9 thankfully got out with minimal loss. Ended up -$67 but could have been worse.
3440 2018-01-31 00:45:30 For the record: 

any democrat boycotting the State of The Union tonight are boycotting:

 Tax Cuts
 Border security
 Record high Stocks
 fertilization of ISIS
 Putting American Citizens First!

See you in November 
#SOTU
3441 2018-01-31 00:45:01 Oil stocks and Russian economy rising is their goal. Shove the clean energy stocks back down. Foul the air, land and sea. We’re already stealing money from our children and theirs. Why not feck up their World too?
3442 2018-01-31 00:44:42 Facts tho bro and or put it in some stocks or something i wouldnt just blow the 2 mill on nonsense
3443 2018-01-31 00:44:36 So BTW at tonight's #SOTU address are you going to mention the stocks are down by 362 points? Didn't think so...@realDonaldTrump
3444 2018-01-31 00:43:17 How much inaccurate is the mktcap?What is the relationship between tether and market value or BTC mktcap? What is your base to make this prediction? You Know that even in stock market you never have  fiat money in stocks. When I buy a stock, some one withdraw the money a paid!
3445 2018-01-31 00:43:10 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your EDS
3446 2018-01-31 00:42:44 I'm looking for a 6 month retracement in cannabis stocks
3447 2018-01-31 00:42:12 The stock market doesn't either. Other than some selling off of health stocks, I wonder why?
3448 2018-01-31 00:40:27 Do not have stocks in the room. Where to breakfast?
3449 2018-01-31 00:39:38 Stocks are down due to some wealthy liberals and democrats that are doing their best to take away from Trumps glorious economic growth on the day he gives the SOTU address. Stocks will continue to rise shortly after
3450 2018-01-31 00:37:48 Hard to say, they can bottom out in the coming days, then go sideways a bit before taking off. Look at what pot stocks did from Sept 2016 until spring 2017, similar pattern
3451 2018-01-31 00:36:47 i guess the month end approaching and most of MJ stocks and blok are deep in debt and the interest payment and expenses are coming hard on them. If they can hold tight to Valentine Day, i think the tide will change.
3452 2018-01-31 00:35:32 @LouDobbs Hey Lou, what about the "timing" of the anti-Trump Amazon medical deal - they knew would send stocks in a tailspin for the SOTU.  Plus the possible rise in interest rates...
3453 2018-01-31 00:35:01 19 years old and I'm into stocks, owning a business, in the military and my health and relationship is great! I can't ask for anything better
3454 2018-01-31 00:34:43 Lithium, crypto, cannabis stocks all have a ways to go yet before completing consolidation
3455 2018-01-31 00:34:03 Bonuses, pay, raises, GDP, and tax refund up - stocks dip, put your extra money to work!
3456 2018-01-31 00:33:53 Well I am glad I did not know those ratings buying in to xrp at 20 cents.  Weiss needs the money I guess.  Not too sure about his firms advice on stocks.
3457 2018-01-31 00:33:49 If there's one thing i want to know is how the DOW Jones can drop points, is stocks some kind of video game?
3458 2018-01-31 00:33:37 Why they saw a drop in their stocks.

3462 2018-01-31 00:30:47 curious what you view is going forward on marijuana stocks...I saw them get hit today as well
3463 2018-01-31 00:30:39 the dream will be short lived as your buddies have already started selling off those stocks they bought to pump up the stock market. are you ready for the crash?
3464 2018-01-31 00:29:13 While some health care stocks hit today on news of new entrant targeting 0% profits,   Vanguard Energy ETF lost more than Health Care did today. VDE -2.2%  VHT -2.0%.  #volatilityhigher
3465 2018-01-31 00:29:08 Am I the only one who remembers that Delay & other c2005 GOP leaders has people day trading stocks in their offices using congressional inside info?
3466 2018-01-31 00:28:07 It is definitely a sad reality, atm. I feel like there will be a death race between @coinbase @ToastWallet and @RobinhoodApp to be the first. Personally pulling for RH since I use them for stocks already and love them. #xrp
3467 2018-01-31 00:27:56 Bought BTC AT 9510 for 95 still holding doubt it will drop more.

3468 2018-01-31 00:27:54 Exports are structural, thus cannot be dismissed, it is a part of the complex.  OECD stocks have dropped by 10's of Mmbbl's over the past 6 months.  Demand is above norms, and accelerating with global economic growth.  RUS is implementing huge domestic spending, based upon +oil $
3469 2018-01-31 00:27:43 Talk about stocks that haven't done anything in the last 15 years, just take a look at the chart on $F...what the hell has been going on  over there?
3470 2018-01-31 00:26:28 Stocks used to cost 18000,they now cost 26,000.  That’s runaway inflation!

3472 2018-01-31 00:25:08 The Dogs of the Dow is an investment strategy popularized by Michael B. O'Higgins in 1991, which proposes that an investor annually select for investment the ten Dow (DJIA) stocks whose dividend is the highest fraction of their price; stocks leading today - the Dogs of ‘17. #dogs
3473 2018-01-31 00:25:07 All believers should welcome this hint of a slide with open hands. Many fundamentally sound stocks starting to reach normalcy levels, and one should hope will get cheaper - read opportunity to accumulate. Remember - max drawdown in Nifty for last 12 months has been 4%
3474 2018-01-31 00:23:54 Yeah I love stocks that trade at 150 times revenue and have  a 25 cent private placement coming due in 4 weeks- absolutely love them
3475 2018-01-31 00:23:28 Pretty sure we are all happy! :)

3478 2018-01-31 00:21:59 Over the last couple weeks every single stock that I’ve shorted has closed much lower. What does that mean.... I need to follow the plan! Let these stocks crash back down! #shortsell #daytrader #stockmarket
3479 2018-01-31 00:21:22 Brother told me he would sell his stocks on a 1000 pt selloff in the Dow. I reminded him 1000 pts is less than 5%. #laughable

3483 2018-01-31 00:17:45 One thing i love about trump is hes going to kwep the bull market running to higher highers. Stocks need correction and consolidation to go up. Anyone saying anything negative of this is merely uneducated in the stock market world.
3484 2018-01-31 00:17:20 Beautiful isn’t it? The many opportunities throughout an Fx day. You’ll never get such movement in stocks.
3485 2018-01-31 00:16:50 Didn't you get purchased for a dollar? So if I buy 1 paper your stocks will double?
3486 2018-01-31 00:16:17 THCX has many catalysts going in its favor - it’s advantageous position is bar to none - at the start of the chain in pot stocks the lowest cost quality producer will last the longest - other end product manufacturers (cbd/bev etc) have more flexibility and play margin. imo:)
3487 2018-01-31 00:16:17 Isn’t it any different with stocks, Ben?
3488 2018-01-31 00:15:55 Not knowing how to run the country? Jobs up, stocks up, unemployment down and illegal aliens soon to be deported. Trump’s doing great!

3491 2018-01-31 00:15:18 About 80% of the gains from the current booming stock market are going to the wealthiest Americans. I'm barely seeing a dime of it and, presumably, neither are you. 40% of USA isn't in the market, most Dems aren't. Tanked stocks don't hurt me, raising wages matter much more.
3492 2018-01-31 00:14:24 Dont let Trump regime portray a Stock Market Bubble as real economic performance at tonight's  #SOTU - Less than 20% of Americans directly own stocks #reality
3493 2018-01-31 00:14:04 Sir, even I was not profitable a year back. I was just taking random trades and trades based on hopes and gut feeling.

3504 2018-01-31 00:08:05 Yes but i can't see why this is weird. This is still in "healthy correction" territory. Jan is always correction month, stocks are surging and we overheated a bit. When we go below 7000 things are getting bleak.
3505 2018-01-31 00:07:57 don't make it seem like it's okay that stocks go down.   Every day should be up.   We are progressing.   Down days.   Pshaw.

3517 2018-01-31 00:04:21 Among energy stocks, @Statoil lost 2.2% and Total SA fell 1.7% as US crude futures dropped on concerns that US inventories had resumed growth.
3518 2018-01-31 00:04:11 European stocks fell on Tuesday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about a sharp rise in US bond yields and its impact on the cost of borrowing.
3519 2018-01-31 00:03:42 US stocks sank on Tuesday, hurt by rising bond yields – US Treasury 10-year yields hit their highest level since 2014 – amid fears that central banks may raise interest rates more quickly than most in the market had expected.
