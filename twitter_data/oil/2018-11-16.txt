42 2018-11-18 23:55:31 Invest in renewable energy. It will be wildly profitable very shortly.

Big oil and gas will die. They are “non renewable.” You’re finite, MFers. 

Wind, sun, hydro, algae, so many other places to get power. And we have to.

tRUmp/Putin/Bolsonaro, etc are all world Mob/right-wing
They push the "rape the planet" agenda (oil/resources/deforestation/forced immigration e.g. Russia bombing civilians in Syria -flee conflict)
Stopping them will be the quickest way to turn the planet around.
52 2018-11-18 23:54:02 Am in, how much. What you are refusing to factor,  Dangote refinery in Lekki here comes on stream mid next year the production capacity will cater for 70% of our local consumption. That takes the heat of subsidy payment. The only issue will be oil price plummeting.

tonight I am giving my hair a coconut oil mask 

FYI, your hair will love you afterwards. 

sincerely,  
I bleach my hair a lot.
56 2018-11-18 23:53:10 You mean ask #TrumpCrimeFamily to cut ties with the country they are in bed with and oil the U.S. depends on?

Sadly not going to happen in this life time Bernie.
57 2018-11-18 23:53:05 Check it out we’re gonna count some positives from today:
1. Cowboys won
2. I went to Savannah and enjoyed myself
3. got priced for a tattoo
4. Ate really good
5. Got an oil change done
6. Decided to do something about my mental state
7. Pissed clear without being piss drunk
58 2018-11-18 23:53:03 thomas you are clueless. The private sector knew it was a waste of money and were going to cancel it. Trudeau just wanted to buy AB votes and give tar oil more welfare.
59 2018-11-18 23:52:54 I mean, I  have a 5000 vote poll comparing Peter to a Potato.
60 2018-11-18 23:52:51 u kno its sunday as a college student when you are looking at eating quinoa, coconut oil, dark choc, and almond butter, two meals straightttttt. might pop into some random friendsgivings to get some nutrients.

66 2018-11-18 23:52:26 Finally got to put my lever gun through it's paces.  Ran great.  Expected to have to break it in or at least add some oil but it fed and extracted at every speed.
67 2018-11-18 23:52:24 Yes but I think most of us would agree that one of those kids actually belongs in the AHL and this roster isn't one forward away from being functional.
68 2018-11-18 23:52:20 Too bad they didn't go along for the ride. I'm probably going to hell now.
69 2018-11-18 23:51:59 Explain to me how I keep forgetting to NOT put oil over my eyes and then they start burning like an hour later everytime.

75 2018-11-18 23:50:47 Why don't we keep our oil and not buy others
76 2018-11-18 23:50:47 Mary-Alice just walked up to me and with a very serious tone asked :

If vegetable oil is made of vegetables and olive oil is made from olives what is baby oil made from?
77 2018-11-18 23:50:47 Oil King also used Falke at DH Austin, wow I completely forgot about that one
78 2018-11-18 23:50:35 Imagine the oil had a big bodied young kid to take that wing spot.
79 2018-11-18 23:50:24 I believe Oil and gas sector makes up only 4 to 5% of Canada GDP. Significant, but, puts the graphic in perspective.

83 2018-11-18 23:49:57 Still waiting! Oil drops 20% in the last few weeks back to March prices but still no change at the pumps!!!
84 2018-11-18 23:49:31 hey @Valvoline i went to one of your shops yesterday to get an oil change, and the tech, Issac, reeked of weed. it was disgusting. Not happy that you employee potheads and that you allow your employees to smoke at work!
85 2018-11-18 23:49:31 A guy up here on the mountain told me to do that... yeah, too much oil, grease, diesel and sagebrush in that thing to be lighting a fire around it!

89 2018-11-18 23:49:00 There are some ear mite treatments that can be shared with all animals in the home safely.

One well known brand is Dr Dogs Ear Oil. This is 100% natural and it will eliminate [keyword] effectively and safely. It has no hazardous chemicals or pesticides and it has natural antib
90 2018-11-18 23:48:57 99% of Canada’s exported Oil already goes to the USA, remaining part of Canada doesn’t get us access to tidewater, it gets us a partner that takes as much as it can then preaches to us about what fools we are.  An independent Alberta means we keep all tax revenue here.
91 2018-11-18 23:48:56 The Kochs have a million acres of oil fields maybe more now - they are not interested in the survival of the EPA and certainly not any new regs or laws coming out of an environmental movement.
92 2018-11-18 23:48:54 Possible Dem presidential candidates recently promoted by media:

- Billionaire Mike Bloomberg

- Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz

- Oil/gas ally John Hickenlooper

- Bain Capital exec Deval Patrick

It’s almost as if we live in an oligarchy, and nobody’s even trying to hide it
93 2018-11-18 23:48:34 Babies can often be treated with olive oil. We also used jojoba. Swab it on, let it loosen the dead cells, then use a SOFT baby hair brush to loosen it more, then pat it clean (or rinse). Keep adding the oil periodically. It will go away. :)
94 2018-11-18 23:48:07 Khamenei/IRGC would rather have an official Kurd region far away from their border than near it, these Kurds are Hostile to Erdo & the ones near Iran are friendly to Erdo & recently helped to cut oil going to Iran & send it thru Erdoland, other stuff too

96 2018-11-18 23:47:43 I am not knocking casseroles... but there is something about Mac and Cheese at thanksgiving. It’s better. It tastes like home and not truffle oil like year round Mac and cheese
97 2018-11-18 23:47:42 This is just mental! Oklahoma has got some oil and sweet FA else. As you say. Beyond parody. Or equivalent to John Lone’s Pu Yi at the end of the Last Emperor stating that Panama had recognized his new country.
98 2018-11-18 23:47:35 The Newfoundland and Labrador Govt perpetually demands more control over the province's offshore oil sector but when a major spill happens it's radio silence from the Premier, Natural Resources Minister, and Environment Minister. What a fantastic, oil addicted little province.

103 2018-11-18 23:47:08 The Treasury's predictions were incorrect, as has been since been acknowledged. The loan wasn't necessary and was paid in full by (if I remember rightly) 1978, by which time North Sea Oil revenue was coming in, inflation was 9% and unemployment less than 1m. By 1981: 18% & 3m.
104 2018-11-18 23:46:39 See, this is how I want to be but, I’ve never really been that person. So you see my internal struggle when suddenly a crave for it hit me (also EXACTLY what I now. With feta cheese and cocktail tomatoes and olive oil and fluffy Italian home made bread)
105 2018-11-18 23:46:38 Wow Saud Arabia ladies that’s quite a protest wearing your veils inside out
In Ontario & Quebec ladies are protesting too They go to gas stations & buy Saudi Oil/Gas

108 2018-11-18 23:45:56 Lol this took a lot of work,dedication and money sha. I use Biotin, black Jamaican castor oil, proscar, rogaine and coconut oil. I don't know which one exactly is triggering the regrowth. But sha give it a shot.

114 2018-11-18 23:45:13 To the Jakarta Government I would say:  in allowing your Forests to be largely destroyed by Palm Oil producers you are inviting the Desasters and rapid reoccurances  being currently visited on your populations.  Murderers for Money... M.
115 2018-11-18 23:45:10 @AldiUK your brands aren't well known. Please could you tell us how much of your stock is @RSPOtweets approved? I love your store but we're think of swapping to @Tesco which is clearer. Are you going to meet public demand for sustainable palm oil in 100% of the items you stock?
116 2018-11-18 23:44:52 just did my skincare n got the absolute shock of my life when i used an oil for the first time and it was neon fucking green

The oil pipeline to TURKEY is the only available for export from KERKUK.,

It goes through the KURTISH Cartcurt Region..

However, revenues from exports will go to federal Iraqi authorities,

131 2018-11-18 23:42:45 Fair and again, not suggesting he should be kept but there are far too many who fall into the "pro" gm/coach crowd that have now solely taken aim at McLellan and it's absurd.

138 2018-11-18 23:41:29 Is it maybe just clogged with wax? It’s happened to me before... you can get special solution at the drug store, or you could even do some drops of hydrogen peroxide or baby oil to help break it up (just do it as you would do ear infection drops)

Not going into all the reasons but here's two. Trump has kicked Putin in the nuts w/USA oil and energy production & killed Russians in Syria.
142 2018-11-18 23:40:58 Trump won't turn on Saudi Arabia because he would have to sanction them and raise oil prices when he already has tariffs going on.

an end to the stalemate in the negotiations

147 2018-11-18 23:40:12 A joint exploration with a bully and somebody who claims all of the seas? As Duterte said China already has possession of the west Philippine seas. Why will China give us our portion when they find oil?

157 2018-11-18 23:38:48 Outside of the breakaway, he had nothing to do until the 3rd. Flames generated next to nothing through 40 but certainly emptied both barrels over the final 20 & Oilers did nothing to help the big man out.
158 2018-11-18 23:38:44 A week ago my oil change guy says hey you want replace the air filter? I'm like great here we go. He then holds up what looks like a literal bird's nest but it's actually my 3yo filter. I'm like yeah I'm in for $17 upsell on that. Well done.

160 2018-11-18 23:38:17 This will change Somalia forever and usher in a new era of development if only the govt uses revenue from oil responsibly.

162 2018-11-18 23:38:14 It would be more sensible to finance it within Iraq, using some deficit spending to soak up unemployed workers. usa financial sector is predatory, and will seek to own iraq infrastructure and make fat profits forever.  Much better Iraq should finance by selling oil, install solar
163 2018-11-18 23:38:14 There's no need for a Refinery here nor is there a market for refined product. There are refineries in Asia that are configured to process bitumen. Every human activity carries risk. Canada's oil & gas industry is among the best at minimizing that risk and responding to failures

Try to do it only with "wind/solar+batteries" without coal/oil/gas/fracking as backup and let's if sunshine&breeze unicorn energy is really cheap and technically viable
171 2018-11-18 23:37:23 But locally, it would be too obvious to say that TRAIN law caused the rise of oil locally in 2018.

180 2018-11-18 23:36:09 You do realize we produce more oil than Saudi does since fracking right?? Because of this fact, their economy is on its heels!? We are exporting oil!

196 2018-11-18 23:34:54 In all seriousness, try coating with with a very small amount of olive oil.  Let it soak it for about three to five minutes. 

Wipe away what gets re-liquified.  If any remains after that, repeat.

212 2018-11-18 23:32:57 Mad genius right here
213 2018-11-18 23:32:56 Well, oil inventory never matches production + imports minus exports & sold ans since nat gas ain't ez to hide i will the actual # and ignore ur theoretical. (Not being snarky, appreciate the convo).

222 2018-11-18 23:31:38 McCree is super thoughtful. He brings Ashe those mini bottles of liquor when he knows she's upset. He brings her gifts when they meet up, like her keyring. He even makes a point of bringing BOB little cans of oil as presents. 

 He may not have a lot, but he's so damn caring.

257 2018-11-18 23:28:15 It's interesting that only on Philippines pensioners are free from Value Added Tax - which is main driver of inflation and "second oil" for state by income. Putin from 01.01.2019 raised VAT in very crazy desperate way to start hyperinflation - which i already see in Moscow.
258 2018-11-18 23:28:15 Yes. Trump is creating new competition for US farmers. Not just soybeans - pork, beef, seafood, poultry, certain produce, and corn in a big way. Trump’s tariffs are the best thing that ever happened to S American and S Asian producers

And then there’s oil/commodities, mfg goods-

.... I say I did pretty good :)
267 2018-11-18 23:27:02 It’s a twisted sentiment that most people see the millions of lost revenue only affecting the oil companies. It’s direct loss from the tax base via lower roayties. Perplexed me that the govt hasn’t done a better job of educating Canadians on that fact.
268 2018-11-18 23:27:02 Can natty be send in same pipelines as oil?  I assume some processing equipment capex is needed beyond pipeline...?
269 2018-11-18 23:26:57 Yes.  The answer is yes.  They are also committing genocide which is what we fought against in WW2.  Saudi Arabia isn't giving me anything .  They are not helping our efforts in the region.  They only help oil barons and investment firms.
270 2018-11-18 23:26:53 And leave no witnesses

273 2018-11-18 23:26:05 My new face oil smells like... ravioli?!
274 2018-11-18 23:26:05 Every time you see a behind the scenes video of teams that involves trades, the coach is usually present or part of the discussion.
275 2018-11-18 23:25:59 We can't afford to buy, sell, or use oil to the extent we've gotten used to. We need to invest in decarbonizing the economy now, to prevent climate change from being even more catastrophic and create a prosperous future for all!

But that means no more pipelines. Not one.

279 2018-11-18 23:25:46 I'm not even an oil guy. This is just fixing something that is stupid.

If building pipelines helps the oil companies get market prices, then you can tax them and/or offer up tax incentives for clean energy investment to ween them off oil in an economically viable fashion.

282 2018-11-18 23:25:29 1572 Barrels or 250 M3, while unfortunate, is not major in terms of oil spills so quit reporting it like L’s are a unit of measurement used by anyone in the industry including the regulator. While not fake news, it’s certainly misleading
283 2018-11-18 23:25:25 i'm literally in a GOOD ass place huffing my orange essential oil from my new diffuser which was under $20 all while looking at junki and iu doing god's work knowing that i'm never ever going into an overcrowded bed bath and beyond agAIN
284 2018-11-18 23:25:20 Still blaming him with what he had for help in front of him is absolutely a terrible take. All the goalies were poor since Rolly. What was the common theme? Just bad goaltending? I dont think so
285 2018-11-18 23:25:17 This oil is so nasty. I smell like a freshly built wooden table 
286 2018-11-18 23:25:08 Did you season the beans? I swear it makes SOOO much difference. A little bit of oregano and chicken bouillon usually does it

Also a trick I learned from my mom is to add a little bit of sugar to the oil, it browns the chicken 

The rest looks pretty good though!
287 2018-11-18 23:25:07 If they can halt ops after a storm they should be able before the storm. Another preventable oil spill entering our somewhat clean waters.
288 2018-11-18 23:24:59 He also slipped at a town hall in ON and said on camera the plan is to shut down the oil sands. Trying hard to back out ever since.
289 2018-11-18 23:24:55 Your propaganda machine needs a little oil.
290 2018-11-18 23:24:46 My Oil of Olay keeps my skin supple.

Thanks for noticing!

292 2018-11-18 23:24:37 Good one. We keep saying the bar can't go any lower, but the bar is buried so deep it might strike oil. :/
293 2018-11-18 23:24:35 Or a bump-stock...
294 2018-11-18 23:24:14 spróbuj stosować tłuste kremy razem z bio oil, jeśli masz juz zarośnięte blizny, które nie są bardzo wypukłe, bo tego to raczej już nie zmienisz tylko jakby ci wybieli kolor, a jeśli nie masz wypukłych jakos bardzo to powinno pomóc
295 2018-11-18 23:24:07 Well Bezos received subsidies of 4 billion dollars every year, the oil companies 30 billions,  trump tax cut 1 trillion, recession of 2008 700 billions to the bank. May I stop or you need more facts?
296 2018-11-18 23:24:05 DAD told me that. He said he’d never attempt and oil change on my car again because he didn’t have the right tool. And dad has all the tools, so it must be true.
297 2018-11-18 23:23:53 Atleast you are working, think positive. My husband has been out of work 6 months, thankfully I am working, but I know he will go back to work soon. Oil and gas has been picking up, so I keep praying! Take care!
298 2018-11-18 23:23:47 getting an oil change without even getting out of my car.. drive thru oil changes might be the best thing to ever happen to the human race
299 2018-11-18 23:23:32 Nice move comrade..  We're also pledging our unwavering support towards this patriotic movement.
300 2018-11-18 23:23:26 nothing worse than a double standard in Human lives. 
MBS hold his hand and lies, lies, but nobody believes him,
in reality,  MBS is one of  Ass naked uncivilized people who suddenly find oil & become rich, do not expect him to act like modern human
301 2018-11-18 23:23:25 Wow , your funny ! Those together truly are like water and oil . You are correct you can't buy healthy foods that is high priced with the cheap wages people are making because the illegals eat cheap unhealthy food and that's ok with people like you , I have higher standard !
302 2018-11-18 23:23:23 We need to worrie about canadians fist canada comes first fix are mistakes then we can help others in need are vets aee homeless the dumping of raw sewage in the st. Lawrence river Jobs Are oil industry the east coast pipeline illegal  immigration flowing into canada
303 2018-11-18 23:23:21 So...I built the Statue of Liberty in one of my cities and once I revealed Oil on the map, I found some underneath it. 

I automatically get it in game but I wonder what we would do irl if that happened?
304 2018-11-18 23:23:18 Wish my body was covered in your body covered in coconut oil
305 2018-11-18 23:23:11 *making fun of Cache and Jason for ruining their dryer by not checking the lint trap*

Cache: Ok girls check the lint trap, boys check the oil.

Me: You got me there.

Jason: We should write a parenting book.

306 2018-11-18 23:23:00 Just so everyone is aware, patchouli oil is more offensive than any political argument ever.
307 2018-11-18 23:22:58 Looks like it must be 22 states now with two R senators. Curious how the high-output states would do without the oil and gas from low-output states.
308 2018-11-18 23:22:54 On how they are being deployed? Sure but not construction.
309 2018-11-18 23:22:44 what
WHAT
so because i poured oil onto a pan
a fire started? i'm fine, and all that happened was the microwave got a lil' burn mark, and the whole house (except the rooms) has the gray, thin smoke, not the black evil one

can someone explain? really that's all, just a hot pan.
310 2018-11-18 23:22:32 Yea there is this cute little trick, where you cut into the mussels and put strips of pumpkin shaved on the mandoline inside. But the rest is just: put it in a pan w lots of saltbutter and then melt even more saltbutter w some olive oil over it. It is the best thing i ever made.
311 2018-11-18 23:22:28 Thank you so very much!! It’s up to the rest of the world to keep advancing renewable energy sources. Republicans in the U.S. are only interested in using as much oil and coal as they can. Most won’t even admit manmade global warming is a problem or they simply don’t care.

私は胸焼け大丈夫！
もし心配なら小さく作ってちょっとづつ摘むとか。
ココア分多いと美味、でもオイル関係なしに焼けそうかも。
甘い方がいいのかな？どうだろ？

止まらなくなるかと思ったけど、この大きさだと一個でもう十分！（大体チョコ部分は大さじ2位）
314 2018-11-18 23:22:19 Will the media do its job and hold all the players accountable for the NL OIL SPILL? #nlpoli
315 2018-11-18 23:22:14 Great idea, but why do you think blue states are granting drivers license? Drivers license equals bank accounts which allows ATM transfers. Hard to regulate. Only oil revenues exceed money transfers to Mexico's GDP.

317 2018-11-18 23:22:09 I can see a huge bounce coming in oil. Chart together with event driven news could supercharge it. Perfect storm for a long position?
318 2018-11-18 23:21:55 Instead of using beard oil you use holy chrism
319 2018-11-18 23:21:55 Good coaches get talent and design systems around it.

Todd bleeds talent begging for guys to play his shitty system.
320 2018-11-18 23:21:48 has he got oil on? - looks a tad shiny - love the attire thouh
321 2018-11-18 23:21:48 #UKOG An ex oil man I know said if a company drills a well and finds oil. 

They don't tell their competitors everything.

If you see them buying up lots of acreage. That's how you know their on to something.
322 2018-11-18 23:21:44 One of the main reasons California burns down every year is due to the thousands of Eucalyptus trees that where imported. These trees produce flammable oil which makes the fires far worse. So cutting down invasive trees would aid with ruffing fires
323 2018-11-18 23:21:43 Must be nice to be able to change your own oil. Apparently the torque specs for my filter make it too hard to do anywhere other than a shop 
324 2018-11-18 23:21:31 @1AIceWolf and me just survived a small public health emergency.

Guess we know to cut back on the chili oil from now on.
325 2018-11-18 23:21:23 Or...better yet...like driving while stopping every half mile to check the oil
326 2018-11-18 23:21:22 Building nat gas pipelines has not been cost profitable in ND or many other places. As US oil production has been ripping so too associated gas but also flaring.  Feedback welcome. $ung $dgaz $ugaz $ng_f
327 2018-11-18 23:21:00 Umm I guess don't over fill the fryer with oil? 
328 2018-11-18 23:20:59 I am so the same  I have ear plugs, a sound machine and usually smell strongly of tea tee oil which helps with my night time muscle twitches. All this and I generally still sleep like crap haha
329 2018-11-18 23:20:46 Full of dirty palm oil. Deforestation, animals being killed for their habitat, people being abused.. Worst flavour ever!
330 2018-11-18 23:20:42 Yeah, I still think Larsson and Russell were acquired/signed because they “fit” his system. Takes less work than to change his system to accommodate different skill sets.
331 2018-11-18 23:20:36 If you want to know what a mini petrostate looks like visit Newfoundland & Labrador. Nearly 48 hours after the largest oil spill in the history of the province's offshore oil sector no prov party leader has yet to tweet or issue a press release about the situation.
332 2018-11-18 23:20:30 Spray recycled oil on fence. Non-violent and renewable.
333 2018-11-18 23:20:29 Never said Dubnyk wasn't an NHL goalie during his time in Edmonton. Rather that he never took the ball and ran with it when given the job to start the year...which happened twice.
334 2018-11-18 23:20:21 30 seconds is a long fuckin time when it comes to 300+° oil

336 2018-11-18 23:20:05 How can you observe the price of oil and say that? Thai nation. Is losing billions $$$ for roads schools and hospitals nationwide, and you think things in economy are hunky dorey? No, they are not. Pipeline Paralysis is NOT a policy. Don't fall for Morneau hype.

340 2018-11-18 23:19:09 Because most of the O and G companies are USA owned so regardless of what end the oil is coming out of they benefit
341 2018-11-18 23:19:08 1. The industrial powerhouse China and major energy exporters are doing almost nothing to limit carbon dioxide emissions. These include Saudi Arabia (oil), Russia (gas) and Canada, which is drawing vast quantities of dirty oil from tar sands.  #gmg4c #cdnpoli
342 2018-11-18 23:19:07 Kyle needs to meet with an unfortunate little oil spill on the track.
343 2018-11-18 23:18:38 They don’t care. The Committee is bought off by the Big 5 Conferences. Really no surprise. This is America. The Senate and House are bought by Pharmaceutical and Oil Companies. And any other Company that gives them money. Isn’t America Grand.
344 2018-11-18 23:18:28 A 250k litre oil spill likely caused by the storm and still unable to do any containment. Largest spill off the coast of nfld in history.
345 2018-11-18 23:18:27 Do some research then come back with facts.  Solar panels would be awesome. Somebody in the oil industry really sure is against them. As for money to Iran, that was their money they got back for sanctions relief from 1979 in return for not making nuclear weapons. Great deal 4us.
346 2018-11-18 23:18:27 I won’t be setting my alarm.
347 2018-11-18 23:18:17 Iceland managing to fit in the phrase "No Palm oil"into their adverts is great!
348 2018-11-18 23:18:11 Why on earth is she putting olive oil and shea butter on her face. Oil field.
349 2018-11-18 23:18:10 Kill the Indian, save the child. Culture, language gone from the wind, only to be spoken in world long ago. Drugs, gangland fills the mind of the abused child, crying in a war crys. The land, water replaced with oil and the clear skys filled with darkness as the child war crys...

351 2018-11-18 23:17:45 The burned areas follows the path of the proposed trillion dollar tunnel/oil pipeline that goes upto China. What a coincidence.
352 2018-11-18 23:17:19 The problem is that BC is not allowing Alberta oil to flow through the pipelines so it can be exported... that pipeline will never be used
353 2018-11-18 23:17:06 Yes - they flew in support of North Sea oil operators from Dyce a airport (Aberdeen) - clearly remember seeing AND hearing them.
354 2018-11-18 23:17:01 Why is CBD oil so hard to get? Everything's sold out, overpriced, too low concentration, or costs a fortune in shipping
355 2018-11-18 23:16:36 Idk but I can't see any vids and icons are blank. Weird af

358 2018-11-18 23:16:15 Trudeau cancelled Energy East by adding impossible regulations.
Trudeau killed Northern Gateway with an oil tanker ban.
Trudeau killed Trans Mtn by refusing to appeal a winnable court decision.
That's the government not the market!
You don't know what you're talking about!
359 2018-11-18 23:15:53 I feel great + I feel like I stuck it to the Big Oil companies :)
360 2018-11-18 23:15:49 Imagine if Quebec had not blindly banned oil and gas exploration, they'd actually collect enough royalty and tax revenue to maintain their sewage treatment facilities.
361 2018-11-18 23:15:48 Yeah but it’s done. It happened. No sense dwelling on it. If the fans supporting Chia can’t see that he’s the direct cause of the shitty state this team is in ...In 97’s 4th year...then they’re dumb
362 2018-11-18 23:15:42 Ever feel fancy af when you pour the olive oil in the pan and some garlic salt.. actin like I know what i’m doing.

366 2018-11-18 23:14:53 You are very wrong! Investment in Alberta is fleeing,the governments on both levels are landlocking Alberta oil! They are choking the ability to get the oil out, killing jobs, killing Canada while importing more& more Saudi Oil! This government disgusts me
367 2018-11-18 23:14:36 Let’s keep buying oil from them.
368 2018-11-18 23:14:34 you smell this eyelash to be ashes of antlers later than a candle fitted into my oil
369 2018-11-18 23:14:27 I love polenta, but unless you want to serve it firm, it’s time-sensitive. Wild rice wd be great, or you could do a vegan root veg purée w olive/coconut oil (rutabagas are good, I might even prefer to potatoes). Or couscous—easy! I assume this is in addition to stuffing?
370 2018-11-18 23:14:18 I’m blown away by the fans that are saying “those trades are in the past”, “let it go” but don’t they get that the past trades are why the #Oilers are where they are.
371 2018-11-18 23:14:16 This anointing oil is almost everywhere in africa .... why??
372 2018-11-18 23:13:47 I like to order cases of toothbrushes and toothpaste from DollarTree. I also donate vegetable oil from them - the bottles are on the smaller side so they can be easier for someone with limited space.
373 2018-11-18 23:13:43 The Blue Flame was later, the 650 was a pre-unit Bonneville with factory fitted oil leaks.
374 2018-11-18 23:13:42 In my household we took Iceland into our hearts. Actually we didn’t. We nicked their point about palm oil and saving orang utans (spot on in fact) and the food cupboards have had the equivalent of a procedure best not described on here. We are, can I say, flushed with virtue?

377 2018-11-18 23:13:19 Pakai cleansing oil pastu bersihkan pakai microfiber clothes mmg buat muka bersih licin je. I admid it. But please girls DONT use it everday

Microfiber clothes is another type of physical exfoliation so bila korg pakai hari2 sama je la macam korg scrub muka korg setiap hari.

381 2018-11-18 23:12:45 We needed Smith going too, probably has cost is 4 games so far.  With him and current win rate Flames would finish with ~95 pts, Oil would finish with less than 90. Can't wait for goals to get going if they are losing games for their teams.

383 2018-11-18 23:12:34 I honestly don’t have any real hair care regimen. I just co-wash with whatever conditioner I have & I use wild growth oil on my scalp. Other than that it’s whatver...I either get a blowout at the Dominican salon or I’m braiding it down and slapping on a wig

386 2018-11-18 23:12:17 The thing which I note is that this involves the IEA which also sees Kate Andrews on TV more times than presenters. IEA is funded by Oil now where does that sit with the Charitable Status as a Think Tank when in fact it should be a Lobby Group and Not be allowed free access to TV
387 2018-11-18 23:12:08 The Lakers moved to Los Angeles where there are no lakes.

The Oilers moved to Tennessee where there is no oil. 

The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City where they don’t allow music.
388 2018-11-18 23:12:06 You're welcome! So if you need to bathe him, I suggest dawn dish soap that they advertised for animals covered in oil from oil spills. Or maybe somebody else has a better suggestion, and go by what a vet recommends aswell. I'm sure you know this though 
389 2018-11-18 23:11:31 We know that for sure ! How about supporting ISIS and helping them to inter Syria !!  Steeling Syrian oil by ISIS help !!
390 2018-11-18 23:11:17 You get a block of halloumi cheese, you cut it up in cubes or stripes, get a frying pan & then toss the cubes in (no oil), when it starts looking like halloumi bites you’re good. Get your sweet chilly sauce or you can be fancy & make your own sauce. It’s quick lol

393 2018-11-18 23:10:38  keep believing that. 

PS- Can I just say that England's major export is whisky, because all our stuff gets shipped from Tyne&wear or Liverpool. Also, you stole our maritime oil fields in the east coast by redrawing the maritime border..... thieves!

397 2018-11-18 23:10:14 If Trump agrees Climate Change is real, then he has to act accordingly. That goes against all his buddies in oil and coal. So let American Reporters get tortured and then slaughtered; never to be found. Ignore the facts in your face. Keep it up. Tic-tock.

399 2018-11-18 23:10:11 I've been reading articles here and there that suggest that Saudi Arabia basically has us by the balls because of a deal they made with us decades ago, to only sell oil in USD, and to buy our gov't debt... both giving high leverage. The whole thing is so gross.
400 2018-11-18 23:10:10 This makes me so angry.  These places are National Monuments for a reason.  He is stealing our heritage and selling it very cheap for oil and gas development.

409 2018-11-18 23:08:42 Then we desperately need an alternative to oil. It’s in almost everything. 

So making money from the sale of oil sands would be smart to pay for the R&D & infrastructure while keeping GHG to an enforced limit.

Deciding between beto & bernie? imho its a beautiful thing
413 2018-11-18 23:08:18 CBC is unfortunately very inaccurate in their reporting on these events. An FPSO is like an offshore platform on a ship. It’s tied into the ocean floor and won’t float away unless they disconnect. Where as a tankers purpose is to move oil from offshore to other onshore locations
414 2018-11-18 23:08:17 If you have access to stocks of tires, you can rot them by spilling oil, gasoline, caustic acid, or benzine on them. Synthetic rubber, however, is less susceptible to these chemicals.

425 2018-11-18 23:06:35 Why my stepdad come look at my car and is like “when you get an oil change, ONLY GET THAT! don’t let them tell you you need anything else” then he was like “nah fuck it I’m coming with”

428 2018-11-18 23:06:07 I'd like an oil rig or a factory...something industrial lots of pipes like that area in the basement on yacht
429 2018-11-18 23:06:06 Snake oil.
430 2018-11-18 23:06:05 Of course, the day I scheduled my oil change, the neighbors across the street burn their leaves...and my freshly washed car is covered with ashes
431 2018-11-18 23:06:03 Gotta love Kevita tacos. Just throw some onion, garlic, strawberry pomegranate probiotic, and sauté in canola oil over medium high heat. Serve with rice.
432 2018-11-18 23:06:01 
433 2018-11-18 23:05:57 Make sure it's thawed all the way and be sure when you put it in the oil to put it in SLOWLY!!! Don't just drop it in!
434 2018-11-18 23:05:52 あー。。。
435 2018-11-18 23:05:37 I remember about 15 / 20 years ago having a chat with a guy who worked in marketing and him saying “they’ve destroyed women’s confidence to sell them products that market can’t grow much more  - it’ll be men now” and now every guy has moisturising, gels, beard oil etc... xx
436 2018-11-18 23:05:35 Got my baby an oil change and car wash, finally. And she sounds so much better. 
437 2018-11-18 23:05:24 Happy times are here!!  Supplies are in and as promised we will show you how to infuse your own oil.

Three ways we are different?  1. We use USDA Organic seal herbs and oils.  2. We use oils that are 4 to 6 times more expensive than the average oils found in the market.
438 2018-11-18 23:05:24 The only thing I can think of to use (Very Carefully) is Dawn dish soap. It’s used on wildlife when they get tar from oil spills.

442 2018-11-18 23:04:54 Changing the grip causes the round to sdo more damage? Dems discussing guns are like virgin teenage boys explaining a vagina.
443 2018-11-18 23:04:49 Oil in water
444 2018-11-18 23:04:46 I've been letting oil leak on to my motor for 3 weeks and having it smoke every other day for so I feel you
445 2018-11-18 23:04:22 As a matter of fact when you restrict the opportunity to sell your product, by restricting pipelines, to only one buyer then ya you do control the price of oil and that is exactly why Alberta heavy oil was selling at a $46 discount to WTI on Friday.
You don't have a clue!
446 2018-11-18 23:04:07 Fossil fuels also keep Democratic party donor Warren Buffet's BNSF railroad flush in mountains of cash. Buffet's railroad makes hefty profits on oil sands tank car shipments and coal shipments from Wyoming to power plants.

448 2018-11-18 23:03:54 A vessel transports oil. An fpso takes oil out of the ground and offloads to a tanker. Way different risks involved. Can’t paint them with the same brush. And you’re welcome!
449 2018-11-18 23:03:50 Hearing a man that has £21bn to his name trying to gain *more control* of the North sea oil fields makes me sick
450 2018-11-18 23:03:49 I wish for that to be so too. And I promise, I try to keep away from as much plastic as is possible.  I know you we rent trying to offend, I just wanted you to see from my side too. I don't want to pollute the planet. And I try to stay away from palm oil too.
451 2018-11-18 23:03:09 @DeliaOnline morning, I make at least 10 Delia Christmas cakes each year, but this year need to do gluten and dairy free cakes. Can I sub the butter for oil or margarine?
452 2018-11-18 23:03:08 Justin Trudeau should man up and go to Saudi and get to the bottom of this and give notice that Canada is not importing any more oil from the Kingdom.
453 2018-11-18 23:03:07 I won’t be purchasing any @Oreo products until they sever ties with the dirty palm oil industry.
454 2018-11-18 23:03:02 I’m on team fire everyone involved with the Reinhart + Larsson deal.

458 2018-11-18 23:01:31 They both stink.
459 2018-11-18 23:01:28 It might not work but baby oil and it petroleum jelly can work to remove it. It might take a few applications. And you have to gently apply, rub and wipe.
460 2018-11-18 23:01:24 تسلم الله يحفظك
461 2018-11-18 23:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?
462 2018-11-18 23:01:01 Why in the world would they not want the immense economic benefit 10,000 migrants have to offer? 
They could be rich.
Maybe it's not really true and they know it?

466 2018-11-18 23:00:36 You think government controls the price of oil? Sounds like communism.
467 2018-11-18 23:00:35 Thatcher's programme involved privatising the 40% of the economy that was state owned. Nothing left now apart from the NHS, which is chicken feed by comparison with: coal, gas, electricity, water, steel, oil; car, ship, aircraft, computer manufacture; rail and air travel...

473 2018-11-18 23:00:03 But just a few. Like coal an opening our national  parks to oil.
474 2018-11-18 23:00:00 Spray the fence with used motor oil or used deep fry oil, recycling is good.
475 2018-11-18 22:59:54 It’s just beyond. I’m shocked California Gov hasn’t stepped up but maybe they are & I haven’t read it. 

But the idea of CA is RICH! They don’t need gov help is as dumb as everyone in Texas has an oil well in our backyard (spoiler: we don’t)

477 2018-11-18 22:59:23 Apparently some #Iran|ian oil tankers have shutdown their transponders to avoid being tracked/located, endangering maritime movement in the process. | #Sanctions

479 2018-11-18 22:58:59 He was a "fair-weather conservative." So long as RINOs were bombing countries he didn't like, selling out our industrial base to China or importing cheap labor he was in.
480 2018-11-18 22:58:55 In today's episode of "I'm Boo Boo the Fool":

Freaked out and had my college roommate take me to get a quart of oil because the oil pressure gage was low.

Got back to put oil in it, turns out I don't have an oil pressure gage, it was just the temperature and ITS JUST COLD OUT!!
481 2018-11-18 22:58:49 Bryan hummed softly as he started with some cleansing oil. "The kids wouldn't make a mess... They're so well behaved. Makes me feel like I was a terrible kid when I was their ages." He snorted.
482 2018-11-18 22:58:45 Yes sir but let's kill the head coach. He has enough to answer for, no reason to pile it on. #Oilers
483 2018-11-18 22:58:45 You are  right!   Green is and has been the new oil!     Only green is prettier!
484 2018-11-18 22:58:44 Olive oil with baking soda
485 2018-11-18 22:58:41 Honestly, I don’t like wet brined turkey.  

Rub kosher salt under and on the skin and wrap it plastic in fridge the night before.  

Morning of, make a mixture of garlic, fresh rosemary, pepper and olive oil and rub that under the skin, the roast until done.

490 2018-11-18 22:57:43 Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
491 2018-11-18 22:57:37 My entire room now smells like my de-stress essential oil 
492 2018-11-18 22:57:35 Nicholls better oil those wheels up, because these guys can fly.
493 2018-11-18 22:57:28 'Canadian Oil' selling for 
15 bucks a barrel. Wow
We all know that's administration fees. 
We are literally giving it away. Giving it away.
494 2018-11-18 22:57:15 Unpopular Opinion on my AD acct. I will never. EVER. not find the smell of weed disgusting. I don’t care how fun it is, or how non addictive it is. It smells like shit and makes the whole area smell like shit. Make some GD edibles or get some oil.
495 2018-11-18 22:57:11 Lol, it is funny how so many #Oilers fans are trying to find a reason not to lay blame on Chiarelli. It really is puzzling but I guess 2016-17 has bought him an endless amount of rope with good chunks of this fanbase.
496 2018-11-18 22:57:08 I know oil of Olay perhaps 
497 2018-11-18 22:57:07 that moroccan oil snapped!
498 2018-11-18 22:56:57 Anyone have any suggestions on how to jump start labor??? My dr told me to try primerose oil but sadly I couldn’t find it ... sex hasn’t been working so later for that. I’m exploring all other options at this point

502 2018-11-18 22:56:12 Flax Seed Oil sir. 500 degrees for two hours, smoked out the house but that sucker is beautiful now.
503 2018-11-18 22:56:10 Coconut oil (or any other light cooking oil) can help fade it off of pale fur, but it won't get rid of it completely. Had a similar "mishap" while babysitting my cousins. :) The cat was less than thrilled.
504 2018-11-18 22:56:04 Listen, when I move out I’m still gonna be coming to my parents house asking my father to fill my windshield wiper fluid and check my oil, etc

508 2018-11-18 22:55:56 @MayorKeller Why are you trying to keep NM & Albuquerque in the early 20th century? NM has a chance for national recognition with ART!! U really want to prolong oil & gas consumption equaling emissions?

509 2018-11-18 22:55:42 The Oilers have 8 AHL/NHL guys on their roster in year 4 of McDavid. It’s criminal.

516 2018-11-18 22:55:05 Yeah sex is great but have you ever had McD’s French fries the MINUTE they come out the oil?????????
517 2018-11-18 22:54:56 Can you please shed some light on regional economic crisis, what’s slowing down the local economy inspite reasonable oil prices,  VAT revenues and not to mention increase in gas and utility prices, it’s not adding up
518 2018-11-18 22:54:55 Try coconut oil? Whatever y'all do don't let that get in the dogs eye 
sharpies are highly toxic
519 2018-11-18 22:54:54 Very few refineries ( Irving in St John being one) can’t process Tar Sand oil. It would appear that Canada is lucky to be able to sell the stuff into the US.
520 2018-11-18 22:54:44 Boycott Turkey!
It is unsafe country to visit. Many crimes take place there, and their government behind these crimes. They were supporting ISIS, stealing Iraq and Syria oil, and killing Kurds.
As long as @RT_Erdogan their president, I won't visit them

540 2018-11-18 22:53:03 I get the masses frustration with McLellan & don't disagree a change could help but please, stop with the he's costing them all these points in the standings. Just like previous seasons, the problem w/ #Oilers remains the roster and that is on the one guy. #Chiarelli
541 2018-11-18 22:52:03 Oil prices have gone into the gutter thanks to Trudeau killing pipeline after pipeline& screwing up Trans Mtn royally! 
As a result, the Ab economy is headed into a severe nose dive with even more layoffs coming!
If Trudeau gets back in I'm betting big money Alberta will leave!
542 2018-11-18 22:52:02 Yes my first few attempts stuck, but eating cake out of a tin no hardship. I brush sunflower oil into all areas then shake a little flour. Pops out every time now.
543 2018-11-18 22:52:01 Problem with naive Americans is they still don't get it. We can't lower our guard, there are crazy Countries who don't care about ”nuke reforms” & actually want more armament. Reality is that the only thing that keeps our world safe is that we have nukes & the strongest military

580 2018-11-18 22:48:01 Lots of good and not so good ideas on this thread.  I’d stick to the most natural ones possible.  Try to sleep in a cool, dark area.  Avoid the blue light (tv, phone) before bed and wear uv glasses if you do.  There is an oil you can get that is called “past tense” ...

591 2018-11-18 22:46:27 most wars are for natural resources imo religion is a façade they put to sympathize with religious people seeing a lot of the world is religious in some way, South Sudan conflict over water, Rohingya of minerals in their mountains, Syria pipeline, Iraq oil..Iran oil on and on
592 2018-11-18 22:46:14 Sad thing is the wealth did not go to the US but to certain individuals who went to war. Ex. Bin Ladin didn’t like the deal for their poppy fields. So we took the poppy fields by force(war)!  And oil I’m sure.We paid for it!

611 2018-11-18 22:43:20 250,000 litres is pretty small for an oil spill in the Ocean The Kurdistan broke up in the Cabot strait off Cape Breton  in 1979. That spill was 43,000 barrels. The Arrow in 1970 spilled 10 million litres off NS.  Serious sure but not a Disaster. They should be doing interviews.

617 2018-11-18 22:42:32 I’ve mainly been using garlic I had leftover and making it into a paste with olive oil and salt and pepper which has worked pretty well tbh,

623 2018-11-18 22:41:09 Hi Gerry, what are your thoughts about the 250,000 L oil spill from the White Rose field? Especially in light of the previous iceberg incident. Has the NL NDP issued any release on the situation?

632 2018-11-18 22:39:27 @griffithenergy Oil was delivered the next day. Appreciate your prompt delivery. No complaints there. My point was half a tank of oil = $600. Also will be paying someone to have oil drained next week so oil tank can be removed. Seems like a terrible waste of oil and money.

641 2018-11-18 22:37:51 Humans don't have enough self control to abstain from ff consumption. Let's admit it and look for solutions that allow us to have our cars and drive them too. If the focus was strictly on solving the problem vs blaming it, the oil companies would be helping vs CYA.
642 2018-11-18 22:37:50 At the time of contentious, early, North sea oil developement. A tradition still alive in the current scripts. I wonder if Fracking is somewhere in future episodes?

647 2018-11-18 22:37:19 Actually Finland can do this be cause they have the largest sovereign fund in the world because of the insane levels of oil they received royalties from. Per person this funds a lot of their welfare. If they relied on tax their rate would be significantly higher.

665 2018-11-18 22:34:54 Trump is the original snake oil salesmen. And like a snake oil salesmen, once he’s left town there is nothing left behind but empty promises, pockets, disappointment, sickness and death.
666 2018-11-18 22:34:53 Ah you so voted for Kodos. Fwiw I get anxious about the pressure to give up beef/palm oil/plastic and I feel that putting the onus on the individual consumer rather than governments/corporations is a massive cop out from those powerful.
667 2018-11-18 22:34:53 But I love fish oil dipping sauce lol
668 2018-11-18 22:34:08 Lol. Try spaghetti squash! Easier than spiral-cutting veggies because it shreds itself. Little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Slice lengthwise and bake for an hour. Shred with fork. Serve with sauce.
669 2018-11-18 22:33:56 Do you realize that with fossil fuels, we can generate energy at any point and coal, oil or gas does not expire. Current form of clean energy cannot be efficiently stored. We are dependent on electricity for everything. So if there is day without wind or much sun, no electricity!
670 2018-11-18 22:33:53 Do you do your entire routine before the shower (like toner, serum, etc.) and then the oil? Or just wash and oil before, then the rest after you get out the shower?
671 2018-11-18 22:33:40 おは
672 2018-11-18 22:33:38 They have a lot to loose if we stop buying oil (petrol) in favour of renewables and work towards self-sufficiency.
673 2018-11-18 22:33:36 Ever checked out the credentials of Maurice Strong? An oil man gave you Climate change. It was a politician, Al Gore, who promoted it. Politicians always tell the truth, hé? I strongly urge you to look into Judith Curry. But you won’t... mind is made up with half the facts..
674 2018-11-18 22:33:34 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
675 2018-11-18 22:33:23 you can stop it w/ ACV or coconut oil. it’ll stop for like a day on the coconut oil. but the ACV will turn it off if you drink it 3 times a day.
676 2018-11-18 22:33:22 And low population hopefully coupled with oil.
677 2018-11-18 22:33:22 Number 1, buying back North sea oil from a nation who spend half their lives living in darkness, and the other half Ski-ing and hammer throwing.

680 2018-11-18 22:32:37 You can put small plastic tubs of Olive oil in the freezer for 24hrs take it & leave in the fridge overnight before using & can be used in the same way as butter but if you leave it out of the fridge it will revert to oil. I find many commercial spreads have added ingredients.
681 2018-11-18 22:32:37 Make sure it is completely thawed out. Fry for 4 min per lb. bribe for 24 hrs before frying and then fully dry it before sticking in hot oil.
682 2018-11-18 22:32:11 What this? Crude oil news coming on Wednesday?

684 2018-11-18 22:32:02 Finally, we consider the future of oil sands financing with some European banks refusing to do business with oil sands producers.

698 2018-11-18 22:30:42 Irony of wanting to go back to 1950's for so-called rose-colored glasses greatness is that it was a time before consumer/patient rights protection requiring snake oil salesmen/women to prove scientifically via randomized trials efficacy & safety first.

There are few on Twitter who are as much in love with the sound of their own voice. 

Except Ron Perlman.
721 2018-11-18 22:27:35 basically a bit of oil then more of a holding cream - wash once a week. The main trick is to basically define the curls with your finger quickly after a wash, and then let them sit and try to avoid fidgeting with them.

725 2018-11-18 22:26:49 A combination of several (usually) raw ingredients with a vegetable or grain base mixed in an oil and/or vinegar of some sort.

729 2018-11-18 22:26:32 I used whole earth peanut butter, but I think too much coconut oil!! Plus I melted the coconut oil first. But no it doesn't taste great!! 
730 2018-11-18 22:26:26 I was so excited about the fact that I’ll get a bubble bath at my parents’ tonight, I only packed my razor, dr carvers, & baby oil at first 
731 2018-11-18 22:26:23 My daughter turns 12 today. Happy Birthday!!!! Dad loves you. I think it’s time to do a new painting of you. “Bee yourself” my little queen. Oil on board 18x24 she was about 7/8 years old when I painted this. I love you Lucy.  @ Black Anchor Collective
732 2018-11-18 22:26:23 It’s not a flipping invasion you idiot.  Invasion is what the US does to every country that has oil.  This is people fleeing violence to save their families.
733 2018-11-18 22:26:13 Faker is a freeagent, where did I leave the Norwegian oil fund?

#BoycottSaudi
737 2018-11-18 22:25:34 Its not the temperature that is the problem, Cali has an abundance of Australian eucalyptus trees which build up a flammable oil, and because Cali has moronic laws that do not allow burning off every year this was bound to happen sometime.
738 2018-11-18 22:25:18 @amolrajan I think google, Facebook and the like know without local news, they will find they have no content to attract the readers and the targeted advertising, which powers them. Their oil will dry up
739 2018-11-18 22:25:17 BUILD THE WALL!  Hose it down with vegetable oil!
740 2018-11-18 22:25:09 That punk would be tied for second in pts on your team.. he's in your grill and in your head. And the oil passed on drafting him in favour of a AHL star.. makes me smile everytime.

742 2018-11-18 22:24:47 I heard the term “oil and water” today, regarding Numan using an orchestra. Apparently...it works !! #numan #GaryNuman #skaparisorchestra
743 2018-11-18 22:24:25 It doesn’t take this long to do a oil change.
744 2018-11-18 22:24:14 Farms in this area are often targeted as we're rural. Whether it be for diesel or heating oil. Last week was a van stopped having 20 odd containers as they were about to go out on the thieve. I know someone who had nearly a 1000 ltrs of heating stolen from his farm 2 months ago

746 2018-11-18 22:24:08 I grew up in the 70s during the oil embargo. Gas got expensive for a while but also you could only buy on odd or even days.
747 2018-11-18 22:24:07 Because he wants to please his base while pretending that he doing his best for Alberta oil. Though he is not pretending very hard right now.

749 2018-11-18 22:23:53 I have done- no general invites his enemies for a cuppa - but my Prophet never initiated battles for the sake of building an empire nor the equivalent of oil

756 2018-11-18 22:22:45 It's very clear US is looking for high price of oil and energy in the world and let just 7 countries continue to buy oil of Iran till be ready to sell its oil with high price to others and Eu countries are looking the best way to buy oil with lowest price of Iran sanction's good
757 2018-11-18 22:22:42 But they would all have had their costs increased. If oil prices go up, don’t ALL of the oil companies raise their price at the pump?
758 2018-11-18 22:22:41 why are my oil changes $85 this damn synthetic oil
759 2018-11-18 22:22:33 Ordered my Jizz decals for my Busa. Life of an oil worker. My biggest plight this week is, where shall I put them? @BaronVonGrumble #FirstWorldProblems

2. grounded beef (115g) in bell pepper with fav spices, bake for 30 min in 200 c, piece of bread, apple
761 2018-11-18 22:22:26 The real problem is with California's stupid laws about burning off, they have an abundance of Australian eucalyptus tree's which build up a flammable oil in the tree, without sufficient burning every year it is not a surprise Cali went up in flames.
762 2018-11-18 22:22:24 Translucent powders are magical! They absorb the excess oil
763 2018-11-18 22:22:19 Edible Massage Oil & You 
764 2018-11-18 22:22:16 I wish you would stop trying to sell your snake oil. I know you have a job to do but show the public some respect.
765 2018-11-18 22:22:06 I need to go to family dinner that apparently started at 3 and then come back home and shampoo and condition and oil and fix my hair. Give me strength lord
766 2018-11-18 22:22:01 Unfortunately while we need oil the state will turn a blind eye. But the people don't have to. Islam doesn't have a right to exist among us.
767 2018-11-18 22:21:44 Anyone who calls himself “Aussie John Symond” is unlikely to have Australians first in his heart. Every man I’ve met with Aussie in his monicker has more to do with the snake oil salesmen than Australian patriots.
768 2018-11-18 22:21:43 WWJD? He sure as hell wouldn't be with these snake oil Evangelists.
769 2018-11-18 22:21:42 TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, or create any property for the laborer?
770 2018-11-18 22:21:41 Heff with his 2nd of the game.  Nice wraparound on the PP.
771 2018-11-18 22:21:39 Just cause you bake something in the oven instead of frying it in a gallon of oil doesn’t make it healthy, just makes it less disgusting to look at
772 2018-11-18 22:21:25 I hear you CL...I've never attempted to seriously fry anything myself for the same reason. And then also, wut to do with all that oil when done?? I dont fry things enough for it to make sense lol
773 2018-11-18 22:21:09 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
774 2018-11-18 22:21:01 I do this whooooole routine like nail prep with nail oil, ridge filler, cuticle pushing literally everything  but I swear by the Essie top coat in the white bottle that makes it last!!

778 2018-11-18 22:20:36 Fried Brussels Sprouts in chili oil in NOLA. Sublime.
779 2018-11-18 22:20:32 And fish! It's been like 3 weeks of me saying "I should get some nice tuna steak"!.  Cook it 45' @ 113F and then coat in black pepper & sesame seeds and sear in olive oil. But then I stumble upon a nice & cheap cut of beef or pork ... 
780 2018-11-18 22:20:29 Well, Albertans understand as Quebec has shut us out with the energy east pipeline as they chose ME oil over ours, and helping Canadian workers.  Too bad we can't all work as a nation.
781 2018-11-18 22:20:28 Nothing to do with the tax. Kuwaiti oil production came back online after the Gulf War increasing supply. I’m
782 2018-11-18 22:20:19 Oil is never going to run out  where do people get their info from?
783 2018-11-18 22:20:18 I did not take a picture...but let's see...I brown ground breakfast sausage generally from the butcher with 1 tbsp ground sage, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp brown sugar..pepper..I threw all thyme in there today.

795 2018-11-18 22:18:19 people love sharing viral videos about reducing palm oil or plastic consumption to save the planet rather than just like... not eating fish or meat in the first place or campaigning for more wholesale societal changes with more meaningful impacts on climate change
796 2018-11-18 22:18:12 Hahah so you know one NHL player and he told you Matthew Tkachuk isn’t respected by his peers yet was given an A this season.  Sure sounds like a fabricated Orange Julius rumour to me.  Carry on Oil fans, carry on, a truly special bunch.  
797 2018-11-18 22:18:08 get some real butter not parkay or oil base butter, but REAL like 1/4 tsp give or take n put in coffee while it is blk n super hot, then + sugar n cream. +ing butter will mk about any coffee taste better provided the coffee was made correctly grains 2 water ratio. TRY IT

802 2018-11-18 22:17:29 Sad that so few people acknowledge our dependence on other countries for oil, whatever happened to energy independance?
803 2018-11-18 22:17:03 While you play games Albertans are losing $5,000,000,000 in lost oil royalties and investment. Shame on you Rachel!!!!

817 2018-11-18 22:14:51 The Paris Climate Accord is not about whether the planet heats up another 1/10 of 1 percent in 50 years. It is about redistribution of wealth. Only the top 3 countries basically contribute. Stop gas/oil production, but smaller countries double theirs.
818 2018-11-18 22:14:42 i need to seek some full spectrum cbd oil that is made with good intentions

837 2018-11-18 22:12:09 But the oil won't reach the coral on bottom see, so it's alright to drill through it and bombard it with seismic surveys that kill phytoplankton that every other thing in the ocean needs

844 2018-11-18 22:11:24 Can you imagine how many crucial medical procedures could be funded, how many more teachers we’d have and where tuition fees would be if Alberta oil wasn’t subjected to the huge differential, in large part to these American campaigns. #KeepCanadaWorking
845 2018-11-18 22:11:15 Houston is cute if you only want to work in medical, tech, and oil. Then settle down. But if you trying to be a creative? Move around baby.

847 2018-11-18 22:11:06 For starters, you don't even refine so you have to import what you consume? Starts to make sense now? how much oil do you think we produce? And what's our population again vs that of Kuwait? Don't get it twisted, Naija isn't really that rich oo..Just saying

849 2018-11-18 22:11:01 It is clear that the Butt’s plan is to kill the Canadian oil industry and foolishly believe a green economy will rise from the ashes.  Not only is there an iceberg, but the captain is intentionally steering a course right at it
850 2018-11-18 22:10:50 Let’s keep importing their oil
851 2018-11-18 22:10:50 I asked dfo at a meeting last year why are oil companies allowed in MPA areas and fishermen are not and they ignored me

868 2018-11-18 22:08:42 WE NEED TO BUILD TRANSMOUNTAIN: The reason we have to sell our oil at such a massive discount is because our energy companies don’t have access to international markets. In fact, we have only one trading partner when it comes to oil – the United States.

873 2018-11-18 22:07:56 that isn't the question. the question is why did it start in the first place. the answer is the oil embargo. CATO has examined every instance of hyperinflation and not one was due to "printing money." in every case, there was some external shock, usually politically ... 1/n
874 2018-11-18 22:07:40 How much does all that cost? Oil cooling would seem a lot cheaper.

884 2018-11-18 22:05:58 When we import the dictator oil from across the oceans just how much pollution do the big oil tanker ships emit getting it here? The Globalist phoney agenda 2030 sustainability plan is a lie to remove resources from a resourceful people & country. It’s enslavement to globalism
885 2018-11-18 22:05:55 Because it is easier to throw money around when oil was over $100/b and give people false sense that the economy was doing well...Allow unlimited importation of almost everything and let the party go on..Than it is to start investing in infrastructures, Agriculture, et...Get it?

894 2018-11-18 22:05:03 Thanks for letting me know. It's only day two of me using the oil, so I haven't noticed anything yet.

898 2018-11-18 22:04:26 I lived in Alberta during some of the salad days of the late 90s/ early 2000s. We moved there because my mom needed work. I got the cheques the govt sent to every citizen rather than save the oil wealth. It’s a heady thing to have such prosperity

904 2018-11-18 22:03:40 Does the out of touch king think we can keep an entire state raked all the time? Especially on as enormous as California? Or is he helping out the oil companies by not acknowledging climate change?

910 2018-11-18 22:03:08 Saw a air fryer at Bed Bath and Beyond. Just couldn't pull the trigger cuz I'm not convinced the food will taste right and the associates really couldn't answer the question. Do I put flour on the chicken and how is it crispy if I don't use oil?
911 2018-11-18 22:02:24 Anyway,  GERS tells us ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about an independent Scotland's finances. The mistake you're making is the glaring FACT is it tells us how badly run Scotland's finances are by Westminster.  Norway struck oil same time as us and look at them?

913 2018-11-18 22:02:03 You didn't answer any of my questions. I returned the favor by ignoring yours, which were rhetorical anyway.

Canada's economy isn't dependent on extracting that oil, despite what Cons & industry say. And our environment will be undeniably better off for leaving it in the ground.

919 2018-11-18 22:01:23 Erm, they developed a large internal market that allowed their businesses to scale easily before exporting. This is a benefit of being in a large single market. They also had massive oil reserves which is what really kicked off their economy.

So they’re saving their brand name not the forrest, environment or animals. Again media=lies
939 2018-11-18 21:59:18 nah should be fine shouldn't eat it though cause of palm oil
940 2018-11-18 21:59:17 Ya but the military contractors and weapons manufacturers as well as fossil fuel and big oil can at least buy their fifth house or fourth yacht though- so that’s all that matters I guess.

955 2018-11-18 21:57:14 The liberals /Ottawa will lose all export taxes on oil and equalization payments if Alta Sask have to move on command changes to federation. I think Ottawa's game of throttling our energy industry is coming to an end positively for all,or positively for the prairies+ theYukon
956 2018-11-18 21:57:08 It seems to me that @GovNL sells the parcels of land or the rights to them, then skips the envrnmntl assessments, helps the @CNLOPB clear roadblocks for the oil companies to make $$. Feds aren't involved a hell of a lot. You think Trudeau tells Alberta how to develop oil fields?

960 2018-11-18 21:55:56 Been driving up & down the interstate so much that I need an oil change yet again

967 2018-11-18 21:55:15 Episode 1: 99% of IT is snake oil. Computers are *really* stupid. Proof? With all the talk of AI, why does Amazon still send me "you might like" emails of stuff I've either just looked at or actually bought?
968 2018-11-18 21:55:06 I’ve seen this lame scripted response before. Are you working for Koch? Lol. I’m not against oil or pipelines. I’m against the prolific waste of it out our tail pipes each day, millions stuck in traffic or a Timmy’s drive thru waiting for a $2 coffee. We should be beyond that! 
969 2018-11-18 21:55:03 Well done @IcelandFoods for making people aware of the palm oil problem!!! Let’s hope that more people can educate themselves and stop buying products containing palm oil!!! #saynotopalmoil

982 2018-11-18 21:53:37 Well done Iceland. Slipping in a “no palm oil” note in its ad #ImACeleb
983 2018-11-18 21:53:34 @ScottforFlorida heavily regulated oil rigs that @SenBillNelson is against are at least predictable.  What is the impact of the rockets he says to keep launching as they inject their exhaust gases directly into the upper atmosphere.  Scientists have only begun to study the impact
984 2018-11-18 21:53:20 I drink roughly 2 liters of water daily. My osteoarthritis inflammation calls bullshit on your snake oil claims.
985 2018-11-18 21:53:11 Rub baby oil or tissue oil into your skin while wearing the makeup then wash it off. It's so much easier and less harsh on the skin.

987 2018-11-18 21:53:09 You are talking shit !!

The ndp or libs didn't destroy oil industry....then cons killed it never wanted a NEP....If Alberta would've listened to PET the infrastructure would have been in place long ago.  Cons don;t bal budgets we have a 100 yrs of history on that

995 2018-11-18 21:51:49 Use palm nut oil from Liberia. West Coast Africa. No endangered primates there in the planted palm trees.
996 2018-11-18 21:51:48 Right well obviously we know what we are doing all running our own hedge funds. But remember some may think fool and co know what they are talking about. They dont.

1002 2018-11-18 21:50:53 What about the Palm Oil? 
1003 2018-11-18 21:50:46 They're not a thing: in fact I just had to look up what one was! We don't use oil much, if at all, in baking: butter and lard are more traditional, with margarine being a more recent addition.

1006 2018-11-18 21:50:38 How about we refine our crude #oil into high-value products right here in Canada? Why ship it out of #Canada at hugely discounted prices then buy it back as high-cost finished products? It's almost as if someone, somewhere, wants our oil industry completely destroyed. #cdnpoli
1007 2018-11-18 21:50:35 That wild grow oil really work 
1008 2018-11-18 21:50:34 I got it from mieneke where I get my oil changed . Go to Honda in Savannah it’s $99 down no matter your credit as long as you make over $2000 a month

1022 2018-11-18 21:48:50 I don't know if that is the case but it would be very logical from their actual operating. Worse, it's all very secretive, while themselves they complain of Big Oil, Putin and what not conspiracies. Attack is the best defense.
1023 2018-11-18 21:48:45 So they think he made the car leak oil on purpose? Really?
1024 2018-11-18 21:48:29 Keep the squirrel oil coming.
1025 2018-11-18 21:48:19 That makes no sense. Weren't @HouseGOP's and @SenateGOP elected by Big Carbon to help sell oil? 
1026 2018-11-18 21:48:13 whats trudeaus response going to be??? buy more oil?

The researched n got high yield seeds from Nigeria. Went even further, to use technology to modify it.
Today d story about Malaysia and its Palm industry is very different. Yes ,we can with rice.
1031 2018-11-18 21:47:27 Maybe you should get an oil change or a tuneup

1033 2018-11-18 21:47:05 I'd refer the snake oil salesman to a TV documentary inside the US embassy, discussing Brexit.

1036 2018-11-18 21:47:02 Damn my car is so needy, “fuel level low, change engine oil, tire pressure low.” Can you frick off for a minute jeeze.
1037 2018-11-18 21:46:41 Bernie will kill the Dems chances in 2020. I pray @TomPerez @DNC aren't stupid enough to let him run as a Dem again. He's a snake oil salesmen that's used &abused our party.
I'll change from D to I if they do
1038 2018-11-18 21:46:35 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
1039 2018-11-18 21:46:25 I was feeling really spicy today too. I was going to get my car washed and then get a oil change after.
1040 2018-11-18 21:46:22 Well heating can be handled several ways - heat pumps and geothermal for instance. Wind can still also produce electricity, among other methods. I agree that we likely have years to go for oil, but I suspect that alternatives will catch on faster than expected.
1041 2018-11-18 21:46:12 I'm an American and I can tell you that the petrodollar has run its course do you know what the petrodollar is it is every country has to use the dollar to buy oil and the rest of the world's tired of it so he wants to Peg it on a new digital asset
1042 2018-11-18 21:46:04 While buffet lobbies for more railcar which is what these oil companies are investing more into, way more danger shipping by rail. Do some research..pipelines are safest way. @Stephen_GM how do you heat your house? Get to work? Cook your food?

1046 2018-11-18 21:45:44 Sure if you wanna use 67 octane. Might as well mix  motor oil with salad dressing.
1047 2018-11-18 21:45:31 43!!? Oil of Ulay got a lot to answer for there pal
1048 2018-11-18 21:45:30 Obviously. More of the same rape by the US is not going to help Canadian oil sector.
Canada has to sell overseas.
1049 2018-11-18 21:45:23 When the oil runs out  !
1050 2018-11-18 21:45:22 Agreed they talk about the environment and Alberta’s so-called dirty oil and look at what they are doing?
1051 2018-11-18 21:45:19 Palm oil or groundnut oil?
1052 2018-11-18 21:44:54 Please look into RSO(Rick Simpson Oil) for controlling seizures if you have not already, it may be able to help.   Prayers to you...
1053 2018-11-18 21:44:54 Because the tolls would be super high and most of eastern oil is now coming from the USA.
1054 2018-11-18 21:44:38 It took me awhile too, but now after a month without CBD oil or THC tincture, the pain became unbearable again! I broke down and spent $ on that vs. other stuff even though it left me short.

1057 2018-11-18 21:44:20 Truffle oil  is soooooo gross and taste nothing like real truffle
1058 2018-11-18 21:44:09 I just olbas oil in my eye. I’ve been hit on the head with a baseball bat, a clothes iron and a vodka bottle and that didn’t come close to the pain that caused. I’ll probably need to go on telly and talk about it now.
1059 2018-11-18 21:44:07 @IcelandFoods The Co-op, Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury’s are all 100% CSPO (they use Certified Sustainable Palm Oil in 100% of their products). Morrisons is 98% CSPO. Iceland?? None. You are the problem - and yet you make an ad about it trying to get us to shop with you?? Weird.
1060 2018-11-18 21:43:55 i dream about using cannabis-infused olive oil as a dressing over pelmeni

1072 2018-11-18 21:42:31 You caused it..you didn't give me oil
1073 2018-11-18 21:42:25 Yes he's so intent on destroying the oil and gas industry that he spent billions buying a pipeline to make sure it gets built. Nice doublethink.
1074 2018-11-18 21:42:06 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1075 2018-11-18 21:42:06 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1076 2018-11-18 21:41:56 I made the best banana bread today with healthier alternatives like olive oil, no processed sugar, whole wheat flour, and dark chocolate chunks. it would defeat the purpose of being healthier if I ate the whole thing today, which I could btw.
1077 2018-11-18 21:41:26 What do you do when you take more money from big oil and gas than any other industry?  You try to sabotage electric cars with a 'highway user fee'.  Right  @SenJohnBarrasso ? #littlebitchtobigoil
1078 2018-11-18 21:41:18 The oil price was sky rocketing at its highest during obama admin, at the time of ending a gulf war (bizarre), which gave us much worse threatening of higher inflation. Woo, beautiful media such as NBC. Damn, how could you seemingly discriminate a poor? UN, the best peace Corp.
1079 2018-11-18 21:41:14 Hmm, I distinctly remember the rhetorics of Bushes administration. George W Bush & Harper take their cues from the same play book . I remember big oil co & banks receiving major tax cuts & sadly middle class ppl r walking into their banks throwing their keys back .

1082 2018-11-18 21:40:42 Hasn't that been more or less true of most of all administrations, D & R, since at least the Nixon era? We're dependent on the oil they produce, and now that the R's have cut monies to research and promote alternate sources such as wind/solar, we're going to STAY that way.

1124 2018-11-18 21:34:25 Since @RealSexyCyborg mentioned her complete jiaozi project, we keep experimenting. Latest batch was boar, dried shrimp, bok choy, spring onions, sesame oil, soy sauce. We made our own dough, steamed them for 15 minutes. Experiments continue.

1129 2018-11-18 21:33:30 On another subject, more serious tone, thoughts and prayers to the family of Dean Pees (Titans DC). Rest assured Lucas Oil Stadium and city of Indianapolis have some of the best medical facilities in the country, so praying for good news on that front.
1130 2018-11-18 21:33:22 Hello ma, can I get a copy of your journal titled"The Limits to Democracy Posed by Oil Rentier States:The 
Cases of  Algeria, Nigeria and Libya.” I urgently need it in my  research, thanks! 
You can forward it to, obafemiseyi@yahoo.com.
1131 2018-11-18 21:33:19 Personally, I love getting down to the steam baths with my oil and a strigil... :-D
1132 2018-11-18 21:33:18 If you guys want clean energy look into a higher fat / moderate protein / lower carbohydrate diet. Coffee + MCT Oil to start the day w/ some egg whites and your brain will be clear as day.
1133 2018-11-18 21:33:01 And don’t fool yourself, Alberta removed those monthly premiums during the oil boom because the province was wealthy...they will most certainly come back soon at a higher cost if we don’t get pipelines as this province is going broke.
1134 2018-11-18 21:32:57 @realDonaldTrump what will you do about oil prices? Saudis want to counterattack.
1135 2018-11-18 21:32:54 I just bought a deep fryer. Until I started having oil supply problems I was getting every other meal...
1136 2018-11-18 21:32:51 amazing how the gari that comes with beans is free & the one that comes with waakye isn’t.. is it because of the oil ?
1137 2018-11-18 21:32:47 I eat rice and stew...

1140 2018-11-18 21:32:38 @hasanminhaj bro! Why would you only make 500 of them? You are doing what supreme does to us. You need to team up with Saudi Arabia, Amazon and rich oil companies. Keep the supply in check. 

Yours sincerely,

1141 2018-11-18 21:32:21 As long as Notley & Trudeau are in power we will have no pipeline & they agree with these statements bc they both hate OIL.
1142 2018-11-18 21:32:14 Ok I’m probably never coming to get my oil changed again. Somebody else has to come do it for me. My patience is slim to none.

1145 2018-11-18 21:31:41 #Yay, I just knew that the two of you could race to a better finish then you did in the first race~!  #Congratulations on your excellent #Top5.  :-)
1146 2018-11-18 21:31:39 In Canada PM Trudeau speaks about this murder with phoney tears as usual but he won’t do what would hurt Saudi  Arabia,  the cancellation of the 20 billion $ a year oil purchasing contract oh he can’t do that because he refused the east west pipeline because of Quebec
1147 2018-11-18 21:31:39 He was my governor for 8 years, bought and paid for by Big Sugar and Big Oil. Spent about 150M from his Medicare fraud golden parachute settlement to buy his 3 elections. Congratulations. Another crook in the senate to do your bidding.
1148 2018-11-18 21:31:34 Yeah, the unrefined coconut oil has a lot more coconut flavor than the refined stuff, (This is almost all I use the unrefined for unless the dish is going to be heavily seasoned.)
1149 2018-11-18 21:31:26 Is it illegal to bring bottles of car oil on a plane
1150 2018-11-18 21:31:23 I fried them in some olive oil, they were good 
1151 2018-11-18 21:31:18 basic thing here: Saudi Arabia starts selling oil in euros instead of $$, the US economy tanks like nothing you've ever seen. Yes, Trump is scum, and yes MBS should not kill journalists. But even Obama would be between a rock and a hard place on this one.
1152 2018-11-18 21:31:11 So start selling hash oil. It like moonshine sure I could build a still but I can also go buy booze for a lot less hassle. By the way the burn down your house argument can be made about anything starting with cheap PC PSU. Never cheap out on the PSU!
1153 2018-11-18 21:31:04 Mum put oil on fire and I tried frying cucumber
1154 2018-11-18 21:31:03 You're incensed by what we pay to the EU, which gives us great benefit. You're seemingly unconcerned that we give a far higher amount to oil companies, they're not exactly known for being poor. We're the only G7 country to increase those subsidies.
1155 2018-11-18 21:30:51 I've tested two WADs for Doom: Before The Nightmare and Lasting Light.
What I can say about Lasting Light?
Well, it's really dark, you've only lamp, you must collect some oil and avoid any monsters hiding in the darkness.
Also Lasting Light is for people, who likes challenges.
1156 2018-11-18 21:30:46 I would think the oil companies would do this one their own?

1164 2018-11-18 21:29:49 when to the beauty supply store for hair oil and came out with braiding hair instead lol priorities
1165 2018-11-18 21:29:41 @realDonaldTrump Sir, CA. will owe 3.5$bil for failed high speed rail...we have enough Oil and N. Gas to pay that back and restore our budgeted retirement plans...don't let these thieves dump it on the taxpayers
1166 2018-11-18 21:29:23 Balochistan Province of Pakistan has $480Billion Reserves of Gold, Chromite, Copper, Iron , Coal, Gas, Crude Oil & Gawadar Port

1167 2018-11-18 21:29:22 The ahvazi Arab separatists have been backed by Soviets, Ba'athist and more recently Arab kingdoms, but despite having the economic advantage due to large oil and small population, their land has been a historically multi-ethnic region and ahvazi are distinct from Sunni Arabs
1168 2018-11-18 21:28:49 I feel like I don’t even know you, anymore, Hayley Williams, what with your odd penchant for processed non-cheese, palm oil product, in a tupperware tub, made by some Kirkland, or Daewoo, in Canada, where dairy is taxed out of existence.
1169 2018-11-18 21:28:41 About to get my oil change, car washed yeah it’s all good
1170 2018-11-18 21:28:31 I always like to take a cup of cream with a bit of unrefined coconut oil, and a packet of truvia and warmed in the microwave. Its like warm melted coconut ice cream. Lol
1171 2018-11-18 21:28:26 Is argan a type of snake? Cuz I hear snake oil is like a miracle cure or something...
1172 2018-11-18 21:28:24 Fish oil is great. I love oily fish like mackerel and tuna
1173 2018-11-18 21:28:18 Correct he said his govts' goal was not just to decrease the oil industry but to phase it out altogether. They need to go.
1174 2018-11-18 21:28:17 Not if we start driving electric; this peak oil hype is like 30 years old...and still isn’t true.
1175 2018-11-18 21:28:08 "Possible #Dem presidential candidates recently promoted by #media— Billionaire Mike Bloomberg, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, Oil/gas ally John Hickenlooper, Bain Capital exec Deval Patrick—It’s almost as if we live in an #oligarchy & nobody’s even trying to hide it"~@davidsirota
1176 2018-11-18 21:27:51 I’m just feeling myself putting on this new body oil. I’m obsessed. 
1177 2018-11-18 21:27:39 Trying to be more conscious of palm oil, and literally all the vegan protein bars i can find have it in them  a bitch just wants to do less harm and get swole
1178 2018-11-18 21:27:33 We are going to have to change the money system money is not backed by gold it's not backed by oil you can say it's back by the water in the ocean it's just an illusion United States is not in debt for 21 trillion dollars.
1179 2018-11-18 21:27:32 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
1180 2018-11-18 21:27:23 there is more oil under Mexico than there ever was in far east. We can not safely keep our prisons running above capacity. Have you plans for a concentration camp?

1183 2018-11-18 21:27:18 This really cracked me up, you made my day 
1184 2018-11-18 21:27:15 We all know that there's oil too in the business one massive reason why there's still soldiers out there but the second reason is 

Nuclear weapons, if the terrorists get them the first one to go is the president then the rest of the USA

At least i could die happy

1190 2018-11-18 21:26:48 Well Chavez took the wealthiest economy in South America with the largest proven oil reserves & turned it into one of the poorest countries in the world, without basic necessities & over 1000% inflation. Over 2 mil of their citizens have fled their country=Socialism.
1191 2018-11-18 21:26:44 Yeah, probably the famous oil spillers have my best interests in mind rather than my state AG
1192 2018-11-18 21:26:44 PROGRESSIVE ACTIVISM WORKS .... BREAKING: we won on palm oil -- again! SumOfUs members like you just persuaded the global palm oil regulator, the RSPO, to strengthen its rules against deforestation and worker exploitation.
1193 2018-11-18 21:26:41 Congrats
1194 2018-11-18 21:26:36 بالنسبة لمرضك  .. الله يشفيك شفاء لا يغادر سقما .
وبالنسبة لآداءك خارج نطاق الرياضة داخل المملكة ... الصراحه وما ودي اضيق صدرك آداءك غير مشرف على الاطلاق .. اترك هالامور عنك والله راح يتولاك ويرحمك برحمته.
أقوله وأنا صادق والله .
1195 2018-11-18 21:26:35 @marksandspencer Maybe your food operation wouldn’t be in such a state, if you dropped selling food with palm oil. Also your food is full of fat, sugar and salt. Try going healthier without funding the destruction of Orangutans habitat. You can pay me for my observations later 
1196 2018-11-18 21:26:22 There are several types. 1) leaves god did not intend us to eat, covered in oil and/or vinegar, 2) delicious cold things chopped small, mixed and covered in sauce, 3) an unpredictable selection from the above, encased in jello.
1197 2018-11-18 21:26:12 The empty oil barrels are worth more than the oil in them... So we are basically paying the USA to take our oil... This makes sense to @justintrudeau I quess
1198 2018-11-18 21:26:08 Thanks to,
President Donald J Trump!!!

Not only are We now energy independent, we are exporting oil produced in the "United States of America"!!!
1199 2018-11-18 21:25:43 Some places use fish oil too, but the research I've done has shown no increase in healing with it. I think it's a panacea and a money maker.

1203 2018-11-18 21:25:14 If they win tonight, he won’t be fired. If they make the playoffs, he won’t be fired. The barometer should be if he wins a Stanley Cup. He has All World Connor McDavid playing for him. Expectations should be that. The Oilers are not a championship team. He should be fired now.
1204 2018-11-18 21:25:13 @DelishCondish if i use black soap with the oil cleanser, which would i use first?
1205 2018-11-18 21:24:53 Donnie:  The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration has badly mismanaged the oceans because it's run by people with liberal college degrees.  The oceans are way too deep - makes mining and oil drilling too difficult.  Losers need to get smart.  Jobs jobs spectacular jobs!
1206 2018-11-18 21:24:52 Nothing better than oil splashing on your fingers as a gamer
1207 2018-11-18 21:24:51 In light of global warming, tRump is remaking alliances to control Arctic Oil and the northern hemisphere, and he intends to influence and enforce them with creepy IT. Prince has proposed “privatizing intelligence” to Congress.  Mercer & Thiel are bigger players than Zuckerberg.
1208 2018-11-18 21:24:48 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1209 2018-11-18 21:24:46 Again this production is byproduct of oil.   And it's still growing, so more getting flared.   Pipeline relief still a year away or so.
1210 2018-11-18 21:24:38 So @IcelandFoods gets its Xmas advert about palm oil banned, but @McDonaldsUK, responsible for literally millions of animal and human deaths each year, does not (a super-hypocritical fluffy reindeer story). Seems legit.
1211 2018-11-18 21:24:20 Also before my tweets start spewing forth like that oil spill we had in the gulf that one time, my stream is probably a minute late, so just a heads up 
1212 2018-11-18 21:24:16 Well done, Shea. I’m looking forward to seeing how your 2019 season goes.
1213 2018-11-18 21:24:12 No, just vests. The scientists who were cleaning the oil off them said that sleeves would make it difficult for them to maneuver while they dried off.
1214 2018-11-18 21:24:02 It's the weird sense of entitlement and anger about oil etc, and some of the right wing stuff that I don't get. I grew up in the "do it yourself", "have not" province. My parents are very liberal, so it's possible I lived in a liberal bubble too.
1215 2018-11-18 21:24:01 More and more, the word "treason" is becoming part of the National narrative as it relates to the Feds. handling of oil.
1216 2018-11-18 21:23:55 I’m like @inagarten making my Thanksgiving grocery list: turkey, potatoes, good olive oil...

1220 2018-11-18 21:23:14 Oil destroys our water. Transporting causes explosions.  Fracking causes earthquakes.  NO thank you. Renewables, not GOP fossils.
1221 2018-11-18 21:22:33  he's in the garage changing motor oil.
1222 2018-11-18 21:22:28 and depending on skin type:

dry skin - oil or cream based cleaners
normal - low foaming gel is fine
oily/combo - gel based cleaner (get something with a chemical exfoliant BHA/AHA for a deeper cleanse)
1223 2018-11-18 21:22:17 This is fantastic. Imagine if Canada could get a fair price for their oil with a pipeline and the literally have billions more to invest in technology like this. Not to mention the petroleum products used to produce this really cool thing. Imagine. That's why I talk pipelines
1224 2018-11-18 21:22:16 @justintrudean12 Can u plz build the pipeline so we can create jobs and grow as a country! U r creating way too much debt! 11.00 a barrel for our oil and the avg country gets 40.00??? Step down if u don’t know how to grow Canada!! We deserve better!! This is our country!
1225 2018-11-18 21:22:08 Marked so low because there is an oil leak and a bad o2 sensor.
1226 2018-11-18 21:21:56 Where is this information coming from? China,U.S.,India all building ev  cars, bikes. Less demand for oil
1227 2018-11-18 21:21:54 Greens plus additional chopped veggie toppings amd some sort of oil and vinegar based dressing is a "salad" anything else and you need some sort of warning label.  Fruit salad, potato salad, pasta salad, chicken salad generally mean a different main  component replaces greens
1228 2018-11-18 21:21:44 Had a chance if gano didn’t ducking suck and funchess didn’t bathe in baby oil before the game. Oh but now it’s all cams fault?
1229 2018-11-18 21:21:36 car washed ?

full tank ? 
fresh oil ?  
it was a good day
1230 2018-11-18 21:21:33 While we're at it, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration has badly managed the oceans because it's run by people with degrees from liberal academia.  The oceans are too deep - makes mining and oil drilling too difficult.  Jobs jobs jobs.  Losers need to get smart.

1233 2018-11-18 21:21:20 So turns out it’s like impossible to find out if Malibu is made with real coconut or not but probably has coconut oil in it so that’s why I broke out in hives but continued to breathe last night
1234 2018-11-18 21:21:14 relative pricing power shifts are often confused with inflation such as oil going up and down. in the end wages have to underpin structural inflation.

1241 2018-11-18 21:19:58 One errant missile into those Saudi, Iraqi or Iranian oil fields & America becomes King of The Oily-garchs. One way to make a fortune is to cripple the production line.
1242 2018-11-18 21:19:53 100% of them in my book. The yarn you’re spinning about Bitcoin is also snake oil.
1243 2018-11-18 21:19:53 Balkanization is about control of resources including but not limited to oil (water, drugs, minerals...) + continuous profit for war industry, Israeli cyber security, & of course banking industry. US occupies oil rich area of Syria. Israel occupies oil & water rich Golan Heights
1244 2018-11-18 21:19:52 I bet if Trump got locked in Fairhaven for 3 days he’d come out with a crocheted sweater for his mason jar  ready to chain himself to oil tankers while addressing everyone by their proper pronouns
1245 2018-11-18 21:19:46 Canadian banks are owners of Alberta oil. The government must keep the oilsands alive to support the banks.

1254 2018-11-18 21:18:51 Agreed. This is a proven fact and many noobs are realizing who the snake oil salesman are. That's why I  strongly believe in the next few years, as this bad actors and their scam projects run out of liquidity, bitcoin will crawl back to 90% dominance.

1393 2018-11-18 21:02:56 If petrol is deregulated, the prices would fluctuate with the international crude oil price. More companies would participate to ensure fair prices for the consumers and no fuel subsidies paid. Govt will use that money to develop our educational system with ease. No will ATM
1394 2018-11-18 21:02:53 Yes, both parties have kissed Saudi ass over oil and money. 9/11 be damned. Which is why we need to redirect fossil fuel subsidies to renewable energy and provide job retraining for displaced workers. Energy costs go down, cleaner environment, more jobs, and we can tell SA 
1395 2018-11-18 21:02:29 OIl critique une nouvelle fois les francais mais comment ceux ci ont ils pu élire ce mr qui vraiment ne les aime pas
1396 2018-11-18 21:02:29 I jus wana thank the person who invented baby oil
1397 2018-11-18 21:02:29 i need another tarte maracuja oil );
1398 2018-11-18 21:02:27 When there is so much cleaner and cheaper oil available, as well as a southern neighbor more than willing to poison itself to extract and sell their oil, what can be done to make ours salable? Upgrade on site in Canada. Use the subsidies to benefit our oil workers, not the Kochs.
1399 2018-11-18 21:02:15 Oil is old technology. The world let a demented Putin influence oil prices. The switch to other technologies will put Putin and Russia back into the dark ages.
1400 2018-11-18 21:02:09 I just had a long exchange with this smooth snake oil salesman trying to give me the self-serving early Jinnah/late Jinnah spiel as a truly patriotic U-turn justification. Didn’t know whether to laugh or throw up
1401 2018-11-18 21:02:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Martha
1402 2018-11-18 21:02:02 I just change the oil
1403 2018-11-18 21:01:46 His other favorite thing to point out was that in the late 50s early 60s oil was a $1. 80 a barrel and wheat was a $1.80 a bushel
1404 2018-11-18 21:01:45 Ye fully don't realise how much shit has palm oil in until you start looking for it, jeeeesas
1405 2018-11-18 21:01:09 Chicken Tender Sub on white, pressed, with oil & vinegar, green peppers, dill pickles, and yellow mustard
1406 2018-11-18 21:01:04 “Company paid by oil companies says oil companies competition is bad”
1407 2018-11-18 21:00:57 Unfortunately, simple solutions to complex problems does not work.  The existing refining capacity is not being used right now.  Customers have refining capacity in the USA.  They want oil not refined petroleum products & they will not invest in more capacity.
1408 2018-11-18 21:00:50 It’s more of America standing by a corrupt regime to get its oil and weapons sales in return. Does t matter about lives of innocence. As long as the people dying arent white!!! US doesn’t care
1409 2018-11-18 21:00:42 Ohh it’s fun if I remember there’s no oil so it’s like old school plus you have to keep score yourself thank god for 8th grade gym class lol
1410 2018-11-18 21:00:37 Also 9/11, and oh I don’t know... being a regressive, authoritarian, theocratic monarchy. I mean seriously let’s build a ton of wind turbines & solar panels, electrify our transportation, and go back to ignoring Arabia, like everyone did before oil was a “thing”

1412 2018-11-18 21:00:28 If you're not an oil producer, you have no oil $. Otherwise US has $150 TRILLION worth of untapped oil under federal land alone. It takes investment. Yemen can only tap its oil if they get rid of all jihadi houthi, alqaeda, ISIS... and restore a peaceful normal secular government
1413 2018-11-18 21:00:25 Well then we will know the nation places their trust in thieves, liars and snake oil salesmen Mr Cleverly. What are you afraid of?
1414 2018-11-18 21:00:25 Youre disgusting Mr Singh
1415 2018-11-18 21:00:13 If they would have just built Emery East and ship Canadian oil east instead of buying 1.5 million barrels of oil from foreign companies
1416 2018-11-18 20:59:54 آمين ياكريم
1417 2018-11-18 20:59:51 I think your example is deliberately obtuse, and most telling, wildly incorrect.  The government does regulate pharma, and had Citizens United not gone through, they'd be doing so effectively.  Or would you like snake oil to return?
1418 2018-11-18 20:59:49 My newest hair frizz trick- soak hair in coconut oil over night, wash it out. Enjoy perfect hair. (Coming from someone with MAJOR frizz probs)
1419 2018-11-18 20:59:42 I still think of those commercials and wonder if the day will come when Venezuelans call out Uncle Joe for taking their oil while they slipped into  poverty and starvation.
1420 2018-11-18 20:59:18 دولة ولاة الأمر يقولون عنها شقيقة.
ويقولون عن أردوغان إنه أخ شقيق.
ويقيمون معها علاقات دبلوماسية كاملة.
وتطالبوننا بمقاطعتها؟!
تفتئتون على ولاة الأمر أيها المارقون!
شكلي راح أبلغ عليكم كلنا أمن صراحه.

1421 2018-11-18 20:59:10 You thought !! And it had hash oil so trust you would get high high with 
1422 2018-11-18 20:58:55 Is there an Indy Car race going on at Lucas Oil?
1423 2018-11-18 20:58:43 So in learning Maly Druid, it feels amazingly like Oil Rogue did back in the day. I’m pretty upset it took me this long to get around to playing it because that’s awesome.
1424 2018-11-18 20:58:30 Use rosehip oil as a #primer if you suffer from #dryskin. Literally the best thing ever. Thank me later  #DrySkinTips
1425 2018-11-18 20:58:15 Couldn’t agree more. As an oil patch Canuck working in Texas, it feels like the Alberta of the 90s.
1426 2018-11-18 20:58:12 Just wanna go on a short road trip today featuring a CO2 oil vape, @mazda CX-5 and a @Bose sound system
1427 2018-11-18 20:58:09 Chocolate olive oil cake
1428 2018-11-18 20:58:02 They excelled in spite of their inexperience, and during a period of slowdown in oil & gas industry. They're the safe bet for Alberta.
UCP has too many loose cannons, a propensity for "lake-of-fire" thinking and connections with extreme right wing / religious groups.
1429 2018-11-18 20:58:02 What is good for acne

~healthy diet can help too
~wash your hands

~use toothpaste,apply before going to bed
1430 2018-11-18 20:57:49 Finally found a good dosage for Mos on this oil. .06 mg makes him chill and a little sleepy but not dead to the world and he’s still his sweet cuddly self
1431 2018-11-18 20:57:48 spinach is unrivaled, but asparagus is awesome too. Olive oil and garlic on that 
1432 2018-11-18 20:57:46 You mean, like , you’re cancelling all those offshore oil leases? Sparing ANWR? Upping subsidies on renewables?
1433 2018-11-18 20:57:36 How are you doing on squirrel oil though
1434 2018-11-18 20:57:32 I love wasting my afternoon at Walmart waiting to get my oil changed.. maybe one day I’ll learn 
1435 2018-11-18 20:57:23 How can people seat here and dont see the changes? And the record breaking disasters we been suffering from? 

Easy, because all these politicians are deep in the pockets of the fossil oil industries
1436 2018-11-18 20:57:20 I wonder how u know my hamlet more than me. For your information, almost everyone is into cocoa or plantain farming. Palm oil production as well. Do u think 10k will do anything for them? Just a 20L keg of Palm oil costs more than 10k. So am curious, what will 10k do
1437 2018-11-18 20:57:09 Stop the heat damage, Jamaican black castor oil, monthly trims, prenatales
1438 2018-11-18 20:57:08 I was thinking more on the lines of casters oil or a brownie with Xbox in it or something of that nature so he has to leave the room I don't know how they're going to deal with this maybe they should just end it all move them over to the other building and everybody will be happy
1439 2018-11-18 20:57:06 Today josh taught me how to change my oil. When i say i found me a man I FOUND ME A WHOLE MF MAN
1440 2018-11-18 20:56:55 it wouldn't work anyway as even if Shetland decided to stay part of the UK it would be an enclave with very limited waters around it and sod all entitlement to any oil and gas
1441 2018-11-18 20:56:54 But but the oil fields are running dry.,...oh wait...
1442 2018-11-18 20:56:31 Mike, if you're looking for someone to blame, look to every single one of us for not caring about global warming, overconsumption of energy, & energy independence through distributed renewable generation. Blame the GOP for destroying our country to serve Big Oil.
1443 2018-11-18 20:56:21 I rarely use argan tbh, my go-to oil is olive oil. But tresemme is hella cheap, you get loads and it’s thick, I use it for detangling and as my leave in and then I’ll just seal it with some olive oil or shea butter on top, depending on how I’m feeling
1444 2018-11-18 20:56:19 Is that a new kind of engine oil. 
Ha ha
1445 2018-11-18 20:56:18 You want coconut oil or castor oil from Saint Lucian a beautiful Caribbean country... for my your natural hair gyal dem follow @holyywaterr__ on Instagram for great hair tips and hair products 
1446 2018-11-18 20:56:04 We’re you aware there is an amoeba-like animal that lives in the oceans that eats oil?
1447 2018-11-18 20:55:49 I like Fleet Farm. I buy most of my motor oil and all of my pistachios there.
1448 2018-11-18 20:55:42 Dama ta chinyemiki kunne 
1449 2018-11-18 20:55:41 Those kids just wanted to speak to an elected representative about their future and about the environment, and now you have your panties in a bunch because that's not what the money-giving oil companies want, is it?

I give up.

Liberal voices don't belong in the Democratic party
1450 2018-11-18 20:55:39 just made banana chocolate chunk muffins with only 1/2 the “required” ingredients and substituting the rest with other random baking things I could think of. for example: no eggs.. try a “a few splashes” of olive oil?? IDK but it worked this time around & they taste deadly good!!
1451 2018-11-18 20:55:37 You can cook anything with garlic and olive oil and it’ll be good
1452 2018-11-18 20:55:21 Andrew Luck is now 10-0 against the #Titans. Tennessee is now 1-10 in Lucas Oil Stadium.
1453 2018-11-18 20:55:21 What ways you talking about ?
1454 2018-11-18 20:55:17 Next time im going to change my car oil n shit , imma ask if they got fried chicken too
1455 2018-11-18 20:55:06 If #Sunday is your #RunDay make sure to... 
1) Drink lots of water

1456 2018-11-18 20:55:03 tea tree oil saved my life ....
1457 2018-11-18 20:54:54 Oil and Gas pfee?
1458 2018-11-18 20:54:53 I was putting baby oil on my legs.... and why did I feel like I was seasoning a turkey #thickthighproblems
1459 2018-11-18 20:54:50 Interesting component of the whole oil issue.
1460 2018-11-18 20:54:48 Someone told me to try dog oil fgs can’t be as bad as this thermonuclear reaction I’m having with this deep heat 
1461 2018-11-18 20:54:46 Kudate na mme wa mtu ni raha hadi ugundue amekusave Engine oil
1462 2018-11-18 20:54:41 A virtuous society wouldn't exploit the desperate & poor 2 have 2 pick up a rifle to get an education, send them 2 do inhumane things 4 the elite 2 control oil, destroy them pyschologically, scream "support the troops" & then let the saps who suffer mental break downs go homeless
1463 2018-11-18 20:54:39 It has been suggested that the government mandate reducing oil production in light of the very low prices Canadian crude is selling for currently.
1464 2018-11-18 20:54:36 Though,I've always felt returning the Pdp back to the govt house will be a huge mistake. If they're to be in power with the fall/fell in oil price, things will be worse than it is now.
1465 2018-11-18 20:54:31 Why do we need to keep others in check if we arent blaming others?
1466 2018-11-18 20:54:26 Rosehip oil has been a game changer in my skin care routine
1467 2018-11-18 20:54:21 Aha. Maybe try spraying trays with wd-40 or something prior to fill?  That might make igloo smell pretty bad. Don’t know if standard “release agents” like canola oil work at that low temp.
1468 2018-11-18 20:54:06 Add nine gallons of olive oil and raise the temperature.
1469 2018-11-18 20:54:05 I've had a guy from London saying today he supports Scotland going it alone so long as 'the islands' (Shetlands) get a referendum too.

Watch for trying to get oil via the back door if Scotland gets indy
1470 2018-11-18 20:54:00 RIGHT??? Time sure flies!

Omg I want blue hair so bad but I want it like professionally done but right now we have so many other things we need to prioritize buying like oil and winter tires so professional blue hair will just have to wait. 
1471 2018-11-18 20:53:59 Other than the Koch Brothers, Exxon Mobil, Texaco, Roughly every oil companies executives, VW/Audi/Porsche/Daimler’s executives. Many people who have wrongfully and knowingly sabotaged countless lives in the name of cash... they knew but they they still did. Tht snds acptbl to me
1472 2018-11-18 20:53:49 Trying to buy chocolate with no palm oil can’t buy @CadburyUK @Nestle Quality Street @marsuknews Revels... Going home for herbal tea?
1473 2018-11-18 20:53:48 Martin P Shoals of Cooper Oil Fields is running it too.
1474 2018-11-18 20:53:35 Okay does cbd oil actually help you with cramps?! I need answers
1475 2018-11-18 20:53:28 Fim de papo no Lucas Oil Stadium! Os Colts estão MUITO VIVOS na disputa pelos playoffs! Mais um jogo da OL sem ceder sacks e o sétimo consecutivo de Andrew Luck lançando 3 touchdowns no mínimo!

1476 2018-11-18 20:53:27 That or cryn oil
1477 2018-11-18 20:53:14 I only pay $40 for honey oil.
1478 2018-11-18 20:53:09 And misleading the British public. Anyway,I did not know the British foreign aid expenditure was 0.7% of its national income? i thought it was much more than that.
Why China require help with extracting its gas reservation when itself digging oil walls in Ethiopia's Somali region
1479 2018-11-18 20:53:01 Acabou no Lucas Oil Stadium. Colts 38 x 10 Titans
1480 2018-11-18 20:53:00 Their biggest mistake was listening to the Army officers instead of the Navy ones. The Navy officers recommended attacking Soviet Union instead and get the oil & other raw materials there. US would likely stay out of the war & Japan would get the resources it needed.
1481 2018-11-18 20:53:00 I outed her in 2012 long before Anon did, had running battles about her as J Shipton was so easily conned by 'breasts'. Said he'd pour oil on troubled waters lol I was happy roiling the waters. Kicked her out of SAWC in 2012. She tried crawling back last year. She's a thing
1482 2018-11-18 20:52:55 Lol change your ways
1483 2018-11-18 20:52:41 The   @geography_411 project of the superhighway would also bring new employment opportunities  since a lot of hands would be needed to construct the road along with the train network , the oil and pipelines work.
1484 2018-11-18 20:52:40 Sorry, you’ve got your cartel to look after you. I’m going to support the Canadian oil industry. They contribute to our tax base. The milk control board, not so much.
1485 2018-11-18 20:52:35 The timeout usage is a real thing but don't think that was the case yesterday. He was banking on them needing it later in the period and they did.
1486 2018-11-18 20:52:35 The refs clearly covered the ball with oil before the game. All of the turnovers
1487 2018-11-18 20:52:32 *me trying to me an appointment for an oil change*

Car guy: what’s the make of the vehicle
Me: it’s an Infinity
Guy: what’s the model
Me: it’s blue
Guy: ...
Me: ....
1488 2018-11-18 20:52:30 Just realized I haven’t gotten an oil change since March, and I wonder why my car makes all kinda noises lmao
1489 2018-11-18 20:52:23 Who are you to suggest for us. Just because your oil block license was retrieve by this Government.
1490 2018-11-18 20:52:19 Vegetable oil from fried food even before salt
1491 2018-11-18 20:52:18 This is sad for the state of Florida. He was a great Senator and a great person. He cared about the state...people and land. One ex., Sen. Nelson was the force between Florida’s coastline and oil rigs. They think red tide is bad.....
1492 2018-11-18 20:52:17 Probably just from living outside. Just give it a little time and maybe give her some fish oil
1493 2018-11-18 20:52:09 Getting my oil changed because I’m a fking adult.
1494 2018-11-18 20:52:06 I prefer the one I made, it’s just equal parts sugar and coconut oil, with a few drops of vanilla for taste. It might have been the oil they used. You got that sensitive ass skin.
1495 2018-11-18 20:52:02 Ooh! We are having a Hanukkah party where we talk about how the Jews optimized oil output to last an extra night. But this sounds fun!
1496 2018-11-18 20:51:59 Any oil jobs in Norway?
1497 2018-11-18 20:51:55 Getting some sweet ass recommendations here, keep it up. Not a fan of Oily Maniac though. Too much oil not enough maniac.
1498 2018-11-18 20:51:52 no! The opposite lol, I meant I’m surprised you only use treseme not some argan oil infused madness or something, treseme seems too basic for such elite curls 
1499 2018-11-18 20:51:52 Blow dry it with a round brush and some argon oil! I used it for a long time and my hair was so fucking soft
1500 2018-11-18 20:51:46 I’m soooo past my oil change I feel guilty lol
1501 2018-11-18 20:51:39 The millions of gallons dumped into the St. Lawrence seaway is ok? How about what’s pumped into the Pacific from Van Isle? Ok? Got it. What about the cholera outbreak in Qualicum Bay? Ok? The AB gov is mandating well clean up. They can do better but selling oil at WM would help.
1502 2018-11-18 20:51:21 Smelling like oil and garage.

1504 2018-11-18 20:51:05 I put coconut oil in it, conditioned it and hide .

1507 2018-11-18 20:50:52 I use it. I also use beard balm. My beard does seem softer when I use the beard oil.
1508 2018-11-18 20:50:41 The oil could be a curse to the 3rd world

1512 2018-11-18 20:50:01 As if I didn’t already have enough problems, Delhi has added another one to the list- Solidified hair oil.
1513 2018-11-18 20:49:54 Last night my daughter ate about a tablespoon of seal oil & seal fat cubes with her salmon - good Tlingit food & a favorite from my childhood. Today, she’s had us read her Tlingit alphabet & colors books non-stop. We may not get everything right, but I’ve got hope for this kid 
1514 2018-11-18 20:49:25 Mag oil to soak in topically rather than ingest.
1515 2018-11-18 20:49:16 $wmt..I am preparing for tomorrow's live chat, but I am confused. If sharply lower oil prices are like a tax cut for consumers, then how come every retail stock is selling off on good earnings?
1516 2018-11-18 20:49:10 I don't know what to write so I'm giving you waffles recipe:

1519 2018-11-18 20:49:00 They also have magnesium oil. Give that a shot. $10 or so per bottle.
1520 2018-11-18 20:48:54 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
1521 2018-11-18 20:48:53 That was 2015. By now the sides are cannabis infused fingering potatoes (Midwest), hash hash (the South), OG Kush kale salad (the West), And CBD oil and garlic aioli green beans (East). Just don't put fkng fruit in my stuffing is all I ask.
1522 2018-11-18 20:48:45 “Looks like one of us is going to have to scrabble about in this pool full of baby oil to find the missing clue.”

“Let’s both do it, it’ll be quicker that way!”
1523 2018-11-18 20:48:45 TF is wrong with Albertans?  Why are you so willing to suck the tailpipe of oil executives so hard?
1524 2018-11-18 20:48:26 I love marshmallows... I also love sweet potatoes... but sweet potatoes are meant to be slathered in garlic, rosemary rock salt and olive oil!
1525 2018-11-18 20:48:21 The one with @KevinHarvick and Mobile Oil  over and over again 
1526 2018-11-18 20:48:09 Put a filter in a funnell. Funnel into a container. Strain small amounts at a time. It takes a quick second, but you can re-use the oil.
1527 2018-11-18 20:48:07 Or some olive oil. And use a rubber spatula to keep stuff from sticking to the bottom.
1528 2018-11-18 20:47:58 As others have mentioned, capsaicin is oil soluble. Milk or butter work as well, but water will have a minimal effect.
1529 2018-11-18 20:47:40 If it weren’t for oil, Saudi Arabia would do what? What else are they known for (besides human rights violations)?
1530 2018-11-18 20:47:40 You're not a real proletarian unless you wear oil stained coveralls.
1531 2018-11-18 20:47:31 Amaechi withdrew 19 Billion from Rivers Excess Fund Account 6 months 2 May 29. Became a major pillar of Buhari’s election. Got rewarded with the second juiciest Ministry after Oil. Appoints his man into NIMASA where  billions are fleeced. He is not corrupt. But Saraki is corrupt.
1532 2018-11-18 20:47:19 Chef Gusteau cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with cheese.
1533 2018-11-18 20:47:14 If he fix the electricity in the south east how will his brother have their money from importing generators, now u talk about restructuring ask yourself this question will restructure the country and loss all his oil wells I don't think it possible
1534 2018-11-18 20:47:06 @SenSchumer why is it lawful to accept money from big corps to go lightly on them?Is that pay to play or similar?—11You get money from FaceBook. Mitch McConnell’s wife’s interest in oil. Conflicts of interest yet sir Dems trucked Sessions into recusal. What about Rosenstein? Wow!
1535 2018-11-18 20:46:59 Totally agree. Being an EU member is not guaranteed if Scotland gets independence, and let’s be honest we cannot rely on the oil that was sold to the public at the first indy rendum. We are British.

1538 2018-11-18 20:46:25 @Oreo is it true you use dirty palm oil??
1539 2018-11-18 20:46:21 For a paper for my design class about the Taylor oil spill, the professor said "do up to two pages on your personal feelings on this matter" so I hope he's ready for some communist propaganda, because that's what he is getting.

1541 2018-11-18 20:46:08 The environmentalists also argued that new oil activities in the fragile Arctic region would be contrary to the 2016 Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit average global warming to under two degrees Celsius.
1542 2018-11-18 20:46:07 You’re saying that Canada, having 3rd most oil reserve in the world is selling to predominantly one customer at $12/barrel is due to the world market? Ok, why is US selling at world price?  is purchasing Saudi, Venezuela, Qatar oil for world price. No pipeline to tidewater = 0?
1543 2018-11-18 20:45:53 This oil thing also....I am i the only one  who saw long vehicles carrying tanks from Albert line as early as 2013 amd these long vehicles seemed to be carrying heavy equipments....I last happen to be in Ug in mid 2013.
1544 2018-11-18 20:45:49 The groups Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom (Nature and Youth) and the Grandparents Climate Campaign had accused Norway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, of violating a new article of the country’s constitution that guarantees since 2014 right to a healthy environment.
1545 2018-11-18 20:45:47 Oh! I forgot. I paid $84k for my Model S back in 2015. I’m saving $6k a year in fuel & maintenance. Over 10 years, that pays your $60k caddy. You should buy a Model 3 for $60k & pocket all the fuel, oil & maintenance. Unless of course, you enjoy giving your money away. 
1546 2018-11-18 20:45:43 That's why i asked where you live.  You can work in the oil field for couple week hitches and make the money to get to Idaho quick.  All you need is a ride to the heliport.

1549 2018-11-18 20:45:16 Chris knows full well what #FakeNews is. He's not stupid, but you wouldn't realize that watching him.
News can be factual in part but incomplete, presented with a bias, given knowingly and purposely to create a misperception in the viewer.  Chris knows this
1550 2018-11-18 20:45:12 Our oil collapse was the number one goal in Gerry Butts agenda.
1551 2018-11-18 20:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1552 2018-11-18 20:44:57 This is why the prez and the Republican Party refuse to give credence to climate change. It is not that they don’t believe it, but supporting climate change hurts sales for major oil, gas and coal.
1553 2018-11-18 20:44:48 contain no palm oil. Thanks 2/2
1554 2018-11-18 20:44:48 People need to read up on palm oil. Completely avoiding it is NOT the answer (it’s worse for the environment). Boycott companies that don’t use sustainable palm oil!
1555 2018-11-18 20:44:40 I have some beard oil and balm coming in tomorrow from @VelvetNoirBC so maybe this will be an ok week?
1556 2018-11-18 20:44:32 Thank you for educating us about the correct terminology for this ship that has tanks for holding 3.5 times its own weight in oil.
1557 2018-11-18 20:44:31 Hi Paul, our Luxury Christmas Pudding contains palm oil as it is matured for 12 months and was created before we made our palm oil commitment. We will be removing all palm oil from all own label food products by the end of 2018 and next year's Christmas puddings will 1/2

1561 2018-11-18 20:43:57 I don’t think that straight men hate astrology. I think that it’s more about wishful thinking on the part of the recipient and snake oil sales by a well rehearsed provider than actual science, I think most men through that kind of BS.
1562 2018-11-18 20:43:49 He was also into community theater, once played Major Magnus Muldoon in "The Real Inspector Hound" which is a country house murder satire (he was the murderer). One of his lines was "I think I'll go oil my gun" and he thought it was hi-larious to say that to my dates. /2
1563 2018-11-18 20:43:44 It’s all fine and well sharing the Iceland advert claiming its importance in the prevention of deforestation but palm oil plantations are only responsible for 2.3% of international deforestation compared to animal agriculture which is responsible for about 73%.
1564 2018-11-18 20:43:28 The caveat might be . What kind of modifications must the importing Country have to make to refine the replacement oil.
1565 2018-11-18 20:43:25 There really isn’t such a thing as ethical and sustainable palm oil. Even if a minority of the production is, it’s impossible for consumers to be sure a given product is sustainable. Most palm oil in Malaysia and Indonesia is anything but.
1566 2018-11-18 20:43:21 Oga dey drink palm oil 
1567 2018-11-18 20:43:10 ROSEMARY OIL!!!
1568 2018-11-18 20:43:01 I worked there for 4 years no fatalities and the Canadian government try to serve its people with the money. That can’t be said around the world. believe me I’m a fan i truly believe oil is the devil incarnate but this is criticism that should go elsewhere
1569 2018-11-18 20:43:01 @FoxNews put more sanctions on Saudi that should help raise oil
1570 2018-11-18 20:42:52 Yes and their preferred winner is JT. Landlocked oil doesn’t compete with Russia. Putin knows that foreign policy wise Canada is a midget and won’t have the balls to oppose him. Canada to become the dumping ground for migrants. Will drive wedge between can and US
1571 2018-11-18 20:42:51 You’re so sweet sister!! Argan oil at night and bare minerals hydrating gel during the day keeps me in check!! 
1572 2018-11-18 20:42:43 Is @icelandUKstores committing to never use palm oil again? Forever? What about RSPO? And why still stock third-party brands using palm oil if they’re really committed?
1573 2018-11-18 20:42:42 Hamil biar tidur nyenyak suruh ngedifuse lavender oil, iyah smo 8 bulan beneran  nyenyak pas masuk 9 bulan oilnya dikokop keknya baru bisa tidur
1574 2018-11-18 20:42:12 Oh gosh hope ya feel better. I always recommend to have a high quality oregano oil whence traveling. Unlike the oregano herb on it's own, as the oil it's extremely potent & kills a lot of bad bacteria. Take it sublingually but make sure to drink some water roughly 5 secs after.
1575 2018-11-18 20:41:43 It is because I put astrologers in the same category as snake oil salesperson.
1576 2018-11-18 20:41:42 Right what oil this boul corey using 
1577 2018-11-18 20:41:29 I believe in a well trained  “Military Defense” with the latest weaponry, top compensation & healthcare. 
I vehemently disagree with corp cabal of men & covert ops creating wars send the young/naive on foreign soil as gangsters to genocide kill natives, take land, oil..
1578 2018-11-18 20:41:26 surely these are topics best discussed by people who haven't yet dismissed Jordan Peterson as, first and foremost, a snake oil salesman and unrepentant capitalist traitor to humanity.
1579 2018-11-18 20:41:26 If you're heavy handed and use too much it will dry you out. In that case I stop everything and use Bio Oil and it's amazing. All of these brands are NeoStrata or La Roche-Posay so affordable and easy to find. 
1580 2018-11-18 20:41:19 Tempera? What kind of Tempera? Egg tempera? Kasein tempera? With milk or not? A fat tempera? I do not understand what you mean ... (I'm sorry my english is too bad)
If you want to make this egg tempra(my)then you need a full egg, Water, Dammar, oil and poppy oil, venetian soap.
1581 2018-11-18 20:41:12 Yep. The cannabanoids attach to the oil; the heat activates them.
1582 2018-11-18 20:41:10 Absolutely true. Doc told me that it could make it worse instead of better. But ... and let me tell you I’m no cry baby but I couldn’t take another minute of the pain. I even started vaping cbd oil in desperation
1583 2018-11-18 20:41:08 *The enemy wey dey drink blood no go settle for palm oil even tho dey be the same colour *. My way to reminding you to keep praying until something happens . It will be worth it at the end i promise .
1584 2018-11-18 20:41:00 Of course they do, everyone does.

It would be interesting to see whether they choose to have their share of the oil stolen by WM again, would choose to stick with an iScot (as I suspect they may) or go it completely alone

Six incidents lead this officer to think *many Canadians* might want to try the same thing?

So, does he like, liberally apply tears to his guns, or do the tears have political leanings? 

I’m so confused.

- binge watching Akatsuki No Yona not knowing there were only 24 episodes
- eating sour gummies to the point of getting wounds on my tongue
- cooking salmon with olive oil in the oven and setting up the fire alarm because I burned the oil
1598 2018-11-18 20:39:45 I'm also really into just using a tub of coconut oil when I get the chance, it's really nice right after a shower.
1599 2018-11-18 20:39:39 Can't sell oil or gas if you can't get it to market, meaning no money to stay in Alberta.
1600 2018-11-18 20:39:35 You know what would help with that sadness? An essential oil from Young Living! You’re like the perfect person for me to mentor, you’re sitting on a gold mine!
1601 2018-11-18 20:39:32 Excellent rag for checking oil levels 
1602 2018-11-18 20:39:23 We are deeply disappointed in the millions in transfer payments from oil money areas to a province that won’t allow oil to flow east #cdnpoli #trudeau
1603 2018-11-18 20:39:22 That's going to depend on what China ,India and Turkey decide not the US . If the US threatens Iran with a blockade the price of Oil will skyrocket and the Global Economy will crash and the US Dollar will suffer.

1605 2018-11-18 20:39:13 Turns out covering your hair in coconut oil doesn’t cure depression, who knew?!

1610 2018-11-18 20:38:21 My concern is who will clean up the mess(tailing ponds, oil rigs, abandoned equipment, etc) when the oil companies realize it’s no longer profitable  and pull up stakes? Canadians? Or the subset of Albertans? Because $$ to donuts, they won’t.

1616 2018-11-18 20:37:43 But a diesel engine can run on recycled fry oil.
1617 2018-11-18 20:37:22 I know. I heard horrible things about cortisone but the pain was so bad. I haven’t been able to move since August. I was desperate. I have to ask if she can inject hyloronic acid next time instead. I read it’s better to use the oil. We’ll see at end of November

Everywhere that has ever discovered oil has a sovereign oil wealth fund except UK. Everywhere. Even Iraq now has one
1622 2018-11-18 20:36:47 Where are you getting your oil changed? Should only be like $29, $40 MAX incl labor and supplies.

1629 2018-11-18 20:35:56 $4.59 for some baby oil gel? Aw, hell no. I need to slide to wal-mart.
1630 2018-11-18 20:35:45 Like I said, you must take us for fools..... The price reduction is due to the drop in crude oil cost, certainly not the cost of distribution therefore price reduction should be uniform.
1631 2018-11-18 20:35:45 Awesome job all season long @SheaRacing @martinbarkey 
1632 2018-11-18 20:35:29 No. Because we all know that members of Congress get it offs from oil companies. More commuting = more oil used = more payoffs.

1635 2018-11-18 20:35:14 Yes you can use oils on oily skin,make sure that it's non-comedegenic. And then I use an oil free cleanser and more Micellar to make sure that no residue is left. I'll use a tiny bit of eye cream,my light moisture and then glycolic acid serum 10% to keep my pores clean
1636 2018-11-18 20:35:14 So clearly you have the connect on oil???
1637 2018-11-18 20:35:12 They only want to sell it.
Wipe some oil round the pan insides and warm it through on the hob (not red hot, just too hot to touch happily is fine). Let it cool down naturally.
That should help. 
Repeat as necessary, during it’s lifetime.

1648 2018-11-18 20:33:45 @GasBuddyDan Good discussion on @TheRoyGreenShow today. 

If we were selling all of oil crude at $11.50/bbl what would our export/sale vs import/purchase balance be?  
Would we be spending more on crude than we were making?
1649 2018-11-18 20:33:31 Get real this is corporate cabal using our military as gangsters to genocide kill foreign natives for land, oil...

1660 2018-11-18 20:33:12 I'm just remembering when I really used to be shook by the effects of weed oil and the pen in general and now that shit is comfortably sitting in my bag everyday like I need it as much as I need my ID. The perks of being open minded.
1661 2018-11-18 20:33:05 They also don’t work in a vacuum. Astrology is junk and always has been. Just because the con artist makes you feel good about yourself, doesn’t make the snake oil work any better. You might as well join a religion if you want a feel good Con, at least those tend to have music.

1703 2018-11-18 20:28:31 A basic geology class and some evidence show there was an ice age awhile back.  The ice grew and retreated, not a single drop of oil burned. Yet today the melting ice caps is evidence of man made climate change. A tax will change behaviour and Armageddon will be avoided.

My university does a better job at sustainability than most of Alberta... We will also be electing a leader who doesn’t believe in climate change, think Doug Ford 2.0

1709 2018-11-18 20:28:19 First a skydiver got caught up on the fence – and then No. 95 (Regan Smith) left oil on the track. A race first scheduled to start at 2:30 ET and then moved to 3:20 is delayed. One to go before this thing starts. I think/hope.

1789 2018-11-18 20:24:17 We got oil on the track from @ReganSmith and the @LFR95 car. Yikes.
1790 2018-11-18 20:24:12 Olive oil, mushrooms, onions, garlic, sliced chicken breast & riced cauliflower makes for a great meal
1791 2018-11-18 20:24:07 Wiggas changed they oil and I get new tires next week so u know we hittin the burg real soon
1792 2018-11-18 20:24:02 Could we possibly export our oil for literally millions of dollars per day? Build hospitals, schools, better health care. Eliminate the debt?
1793 2018-11-18 20:23:57 lmao. oil all over the track before it even starts
1794 2018-11-18 20:23:49 Track sweepers have been dispatched to the backstretch to clean up oil from the 95 of Regan Smith. 

The field will be single-file to make room for sweepers to clean oil on the frontstretch.
1795 2018-11-18 20:23:48 You are wrong I have never received welfare in my life I worked in the oil field all my life while I farmed and expanded my farm raised three kids on Santa Claus  Easter bunny and tooth fairy and loved their smiles each time

1799 2018-11-18 20:23:35 I need to do my cars oil change but I’m too lazy to go get the oil. 
1800 2018-11-18 20:23:33 Regan Smith on our road, could be the reason there is oil on the track
1801 2018-11-18 20:23:32 Rough start for the 95 of @ReganSmith. Officials are calling him to the pits for an oil leak. #FordEcoBoost400

1806 2018-11-18 20:23:23 Start will be delayed as they have to clean almost the whole track for oil. Putting oil dry down as we speak.

Tell that to the 300 Russians Trump obliterated on the battlefield and then tell them how USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999.

Your ignorance is astonishing
1808 2018-11-18 20:23:10 The 95 is leaking oil. @tydillon has noted it and the @DowRacing team is talking about it.

1812 2018-11-18 20:23:00 Regan Smith to the pits. His car is leaking oil
1813 2018-11-18 20:22:56 The No. 95 car of Regan Smith has been black flagged for dropping oil on the track during pace laps. He will have to come down pit road.

1817 2018-11-18 20:22:51 Oh my god. So the 95 is leaking oil. Of course. Played him a few times on fantasy today.
1818 2018-11-18 20:22:51 Smith black flagged already for dropping oil
1819 2018-11-18 20:22:48 The 95 of @ReganSmith has been posted for an oil leak.

Meanwhile, @dennyhamlin gives a bump to the pace car down the frontstretch.

1820 2018-11-18 20:22:43 It doesn't just affect orangutans, palm oil Deforests giant giant swaths of forests. Its a very valid environmental issue
1821 2018-11-18 20:22:37 Could it be better? Could we eliminate the national debt by bringing millions of dollars a day by exporting our oil? Would more company’s move to Canada instead of away? No let’s tax everyone with a new carbon tax. It’s nonsense.

1830 2018-11-18 20:22:11 Talk of OIL on the track!! Drivers are saying they see it. Now Regan Smith being called to pit road. Let’s see if they need to delay start to clean the track.
1831 2018-11-18 20:22:09 Smith is dropping oil. They are making him pit and checking the track for fluid. #nascar
1832 2018-11-18 20:22:06 Possible oil on the backstretch, maybe from the 95 car. #NASCAR

1898 2018-11-18 20:15:09 Trump fears the Saudis will curtail oil production and drive up world price. The US economy already faces higher consumer prices and interest rates due to Trump's budget and tariffs. High gas prices would seal Trump's doom.
1899 2018-11-18 20:14:54 You're right, environmental and political issues need to be kept separate. 

However, they never will. The rich firms who's business is to make products using palm oil run the world, and sadly it means environments suffer.
1900 2018-11-18 20:14:30 Various fields. Just to give a brief, for example, between 1999 and 2003, oil prices then were hovering between $16 and $28 yet their govt managed to pay up salary arrears from decades back, clear up our national debts and build up foreign reserves. Our Gross Domestic Product
1901 2018-11-18 20:14:28 I should also add that “environmentally friendly” cars aren’t so friendly. Fossil fuels are still needed to produce the plastic, rubber and even metal used on the cars. And lithium mining for the batteries is actually more impactful than drilling for oil. Nice try though.
1902 2018-11-18 20:14:28 You guys know my opinion of McLellan. I have been begging he be fired for 2 years. Why are we waiting now? What are the expectations? Just playoffs? That’s it?

1905 2018-11-18 20:14:07 You cannot take a 3 month snapshot and say the economy is booming because of Trudeau.  Most of the gains you referred to are due to increased oil prices.  Since Trudeau was elected, the overall growth in GDP has been marginal at best.
1906 2018-11-18 20:14:03 Haha, understandable! I think the strangest thing is the mousse to oil thing tbh. I've had shower creams that start as an oily fluid but froths up, but never the opposite?

1929 2018-11-18 20:11:41 Hormones!! Caster oil, tiny bit massage your scalp, as needed, does wonders! Scalp is skin too... you moisturize your hands, face and scalp needs it too, hope that works!
1930 2018-11-18 20:11:40 Oil just need to keep sending the slow goons out to chase and take penalties

1932 2018-11-18 20:11:29 I remember the day we invaded Iran. I was interviewing a soldier who just came home. She said, “We’ll be there for 15 years.”
IMO, GW wanted to finish the job that his Daddy started. Plus, Cheney wanted their oil.
1933 2018-11-18 20:11:24 I'm sorry man. Not buying any snake oil.
1934 2018-11-18 20:11:16 Making Elysium stuff for the holidays. Few new items in the works: CBD-infused bath bombs and Healing Balm, beard oil, and whipped butter lotion. :)
1935 2018-11-18 20:11:03 How do u explain this? According to TRRC 601 oil wells completed in TX in Aug vs. 940 oil wells completed in July yet production +126kbpd MoM?  TRRC has 553 oil wells being completed in Sept vs avg YTD run rate of ~760/month..If #s are correct how is prod increasing @ that rate ?
1936 2018-11-18 20:10:59 What's he going to do,invade Saudi Arabia and take there oil ??
1937 2018-11-18 20:10:51 As an Oil fan for 35 years, im still amazed by our fan base. M. Tkachuk is not going to fight Lucic. His petty acts draw penalties. Which is part of the game and essential. He does it better than most. We used to have a guy like that named @tikitalk10. Get it together oil fans.
1938 2018-11-18 20:10:26 Are you aware of the difference in   how Norways oil industry was set up compared to ours? Also, as we can't go back in time isn't it better to concentrate on now and the future?
1939 2018-11-18 20:10:26 On some level, US leaders actually believed they could stop all #oil exports from #Iran. Well, the real world disagreed w/ their delusions of grandeur. They will be quite lucky if they can reduce them by 40% as they predict. Meanwhile, terms of the “waivers” are kept secret. Lol.

1945 2018-11-18 20:10:02 The environmentalists also argued that new oil activities in the fragile Arctic region would be contrary to the 2016 Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit average global warming to under two degrees Celsius.
1946 2018-11-18 20:10:00 In all seriousness though I think it's a moisturizer? And oil for the hair is not entirely odd, it works as a kind of moisturizer for the hair, gets it shiny. Used mostly on the ends and is great for drier hair, especially curly hair for fighting frizz a bit.
1947 2018-11-18 20:09:58 Senti ma stavamo a parla' de  cioccolata buona, perché ora tiri in ballo una variante no fat no sugar no oil no chocolat vegana che sa di segatura liquida?
1948 2018-11-18 20:09:55 OPEC is running out of oil....they were at 60% 20 years ago....times they are a changin’ US wisely and serendipitously held on to shale deposits till now.God is amazing with His timing!
1949 2018-11-18 20:09:53 Just as Nigerians have not equally forgotten all the wilderness that PDP 16years administration has taken them through with hardly anything to show for it relatively to all the financial resources at their disposal from crude oil exchange.
1950 2018-11-18 20:09:48 girl same!! I had like none left it was horrible but I make a mixture of castor oil & coconut oil in an empty mascara tube to condition them and it works wonders

1952 2018-11-18 20:09:34 Groups Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom (Nature and Youth) and the Grandparents Climate Campaign had accused Norway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, of violating a new article of the country’s constitution that guarantees since 2014 the right to a healthy environment.
1953 2018-11-18 20:09:31 There's more into oil and water not mixing....different energies total different frequencies
1954 2018-11-18 20:09:27 A couple of them got burnt, but most came out okay. Try it sometime. Use a pain or deep fryer and fry the plantains in avocado oil. Once done, drizzle more oil and add minced garlic. So good. Or go the powdered sugar route and be bad 
1955 2018-11-18 20:09:12 Put olive oil in your ear

1957 2018-11-18 20:08:51 That's the likely scenario as, at least from Colombia, there are no sales permitted of unprocessed biomass.  We expect foreign importers will buy bulk oil to use in their own formulations.

1961 2018-11-18 20:08:35 @sainsburys sorry Rob can't believe you. If it says #PalmOil on the ingredients then we aren't buying it. Replace all Palm Oil with alternatives then we'll buy and pay extra if we have too. @Jenny41Samuel agrees also.
1962 2018-11-18 20:08:26 Who’s taking bets on Elvis, the Beatles, ACCA DACCA, Midnight Oil or something by Jimmy Barnes?

1963 2018-11-18 20:08:26 Oil of Oregano is a good immune system booster if you feel a cold coming. Enjoy the race, hope you get well soon.
1964 2018-11-18 20:08:25 Excellent choice! That has the San Marzano tomatoes and infused garlic oil. Fresh basil to finish.

1967 2018-11-18 20:08:14 Why does Westminster want Scotland in the Union?

Army recruits
Whisky rev
Fishing grounds (to trade)
Policy testing
Fracking
Financial services
Scots to insult.

Just #DissolveTheUnion now!
1968 2018-11-18 20:08:10 Use a drop of oil per two inches square affected; make sure oil covers it all. Slice a potato, raw, and place the slice on the affected area; keep in place with light bandage. High starch matrix draws out the oil, and the capsaicinoids along with.

1978 2018-11-18 20:06:55 20 billion$ oil subsidies per year. That's more than what Tesla needed in it's entire history. But yeah these asshles hate only what they want to hate.
1979 2018-11-18 20:06:53 Norway has a trillion dollar oil fund on less oil than Scotland has produced. If only they had the benefit of WM.
UK has the worst state pension in relation to average earnings in the developed world and is ending freedom of movement.

1995 2018-11-18 20:05:41 that’s a lot of oil

2005 2018-11-18 20:04:12 The thing is....... Companies using Palm Oil do not flag up that they are ONLY using RSPO oil.... why?
Also, in order to create these vast acres of RSPO oil.... how did they do this? By deforestation in the first place!
2006 2018-11-18 20:04:11 Really? I didn’t know. Clear signs of a mental deficit going on here. I saw that in my father when he argued that the Arab states had oil because they had buried tin cans. Sort of akin to raking...

2010 2018-11-18 20:03:30 The Canadian oil price has dropped to such a level it's becoming an "emergency situation." @GasBuddyDan joins me next.
2011 2018-11-18 20:03:22 you are wrong. It is impossible to get enough sustainable palm oil to meet demand. Then what? Unless the public seriously cuts back on palm oil, more deforestation. Let's just put less oil in our food?
2012 2018-11-18 20:03:22 South Yemen would rather be an oil colony of Tent of Saud to fund some ridiculous West World amusement park. "I hope you can support our right to live" You must realize how shitty that sounds.

2019 2018-11-18 20:02:15 Not surprising that happening in Ohio. Bitters are categorized by federal government as food product same as olive oil. Meaning anyone can buy without being 21. It’s legal for interstate commerce. This is so on brand for Ohio beverage control

2044 2018-11-18 19:59:53 Just wrong James. Nothing wrong with profits it keeps people in jobs and pays for taxes but it has to be carried out ethically . We all drive cars so at the moment we need oil but where is the environmental consideration in this?

Higher SEC avg oil prices for 2018 will result in increased proved reserves but nowhere near what is needed to support production forecasts.

2053 2018-11-18 19:58:59 The energy industry is doing more for diversity than any other industry.  If you dislike oil and gas that much, show it by going completely oil and gas free, meaning you can’t buy anything in a store, cause it got there using oil and gas. Naked and afraid.
2054 2018-11-18 19:58:56 I can't begin to tell you what it felt like to have to sit thru the TV ads from Joe Kennedy about his "friend" in Venezuela that let him supply heating oil in Massachusetts. Citizens Energy? Funny how he's not mentioning that cozy relationship anymore. People in Venezuela starve.
2055 2018-11-18 19:58:35 If you want to improve your blood pressure and overall weight don’t eat foods with saturated fat and trans fat like butter , milk, lard,  cooked in animal fat . Use olive oil sunflower seed oil and peanut oil that’s unsaturated fat!
2056 2018-11-18 19:58:26 Paris Accord is redistribution of US wealth.

Trump-style tariffs are working.

Syrian strike has to do with Russia-Iran oil pipeline.  We can't let that succeed.  R-I goal is to collapse our economy using petro-dollar.

Agree on #4

Med needs of trans make them non-deployable.
2057 2018-11-18 19:58:26 So there isn’t an episode where The Doctor discovers that a corrupt Chemical Plant is polluting the local environment with gallons of crude oil waste — by the orders of a supercomputer obsessed with ‘efficiency’ who is literally named BOSS?

2062 2018-11-18 19:57:57 So @electrolemon I have two thoughts:
#1: if you leave pesto in the fridge it’s wonderfully scoopable without getting oil everywhere.
#2: @miel is a monster for that onion bagel/strawberry cream cheese love. I literally just tried it at my deli & my soul is offended by this mix.

2070 2018-11-18 19:57:08 From what I understand Alaska has an ocean of oil under it.  It's a good thing we've saved it so we have access to oil if things with Iran/China get any crazier.
2071 2018-11-18 19:56:55 64oz of oil done 32 more to go......I’m making green death

2073 2018-11-18 19:56:50 I think the temporary sewage releases for the purpose of system repair and upgrade pales in comparison with the environmental mess left by abandoned oil wells and tailings ponds that the public will inevitably have to clean up.

2088 2018-11-18 19:54:46 Ha, ha, Lance, you've swallowed the AB whining wholesale. The decline in investment is due to a global supply glut caused by *the oil industry itself*. No one forced the industry to supply the technologies needed to release tight oil, thus leading to the US shale revolution.

2115 2018-11-18 19:51:23 The Syrian civil war got a lot more attention before Trump. That's because Saudi Arabia wanted Assad out so they could control the oil into Europe. Russia didn't want this. So they recruited Trump to help reinstall Assad. Thats my take anyway. Any thoughts?
2116 2018-11-18 19:50:48 It's a myth that oil is dead dinosaurs. It's mostly plants and micro-organisms.

Way back when, there weren't as many living things breaking stuff down as there is now. Dead plant matter would keep piling up in way larger quantities.

2118 2018-11-18 19:50:29 I would consider it originally a way of preparing home garden produce that doesn't involve heat, so faster than something that needs a fire or permanent structure (hearth, oven, etc.), but now since grown to include things with a fat or oil base served cold.

2169 2018-11-18 19:44:27 He seems to think petroleum is used for one thing. We use oil for kind of everything. If we stopped burning it for fuel, we'd still need to drill.
2170 2018-11-18 19:44:23 There are no losses...Albertans, Saskatchewanians, Manatobans refine more than we use but pay full price at pumps as were told markets are integrated...massive profit for oil companies who pay little in royalties at this price.

Then the value (refinery margin) is calculated by multiplying slate by product prices then minus oil cost (benchmark+/-diff) minus transport minus other costs
2184 2018-11-18 19:42:02 If we lived say under a sane benevolent dictatorship with long-term view, they would probably do something along the lines of taking all money from all oil & gas producers & their investors and use it to completely change our use of power within 12 months...
2185 2018-11-18 19:41:50 Waiting out Saudi Arabia in the oil industry worked, it just didn’t happen overnight. I’ll be patient to see if waiting out China proves out.

2187 2018-11-18 19:41:45 Incorrect. Pizza as created in Rome is an olive oil flatbread. No additions.
2188 2018-11-18 19:41:40 Considering the fact that the main driver of the Nigerian economy is the oil sector while other sectors contribution to the GDP are not encouraging with the industrial sectors contribution of just 10% #TheAtikuPlan @atiku

2192 2018-11-18 19:41:34 @TennisConnected Not everyday one of the youngsters on tour beat both Federer and Djokovic on back-to-back days in a big tourney. Now we will need to see it from Zverev in a Slam during 2019.
2193 2018-11-18 19:41:29 Deep fried. Best with garlic and avocado oil. Gladys likes hers with powdered sugar
2194 2018-11-18 19:41:22 1. I step on the lashes I just bought yesterday
2. I have to rewrap gifts I didn’t buy because the owner forgot to take off the tags
3. I JUST DISCOVERED MY COCONUT OIL BOTTLE SPILLED ALL OVER MY DESK
2195 2018-11-18 19:41:12 Not yet but thinking of you and getting some oil out,,,,,, time to rub one out thinking about you sitting on my face.

2198 2018-11-18 19:40:57 Oiler fans, I too loathe Tkachuk but he played the Oil like a fiddle last night. He had a game plan and executed it flawlessly. Oilers took the bait and paid for it in penalties. We reacted the way he knew we would. Gotta be smarter, IMO.
2199 2018-11-18 19:40:55 This story sucks: nothing will happen, nobody will talk or take revenge! Especially not against a filthy-rich prince of a filthy-rich terrorist oil empire!
2200 2018-11-18 19:40:43 Bahahaha good one

I'd have thought a good Conservative would have seen the Draisatel mugging of Chucky as what it was...winding him up. Now he's wound up and the Oil complains. Seems like they got what they wanted. Kept him off the scoresheet tho.

Perhaps you should consider that Saudi Arabia is the US’s closest ally in the gulf region, the US has a huge airbase at Riyadh, and SA influences world oil prices by adjusting its exports.

2209 2018-11-18 19:39:28 Yep. It's a street. Dogs piss on it. Cars drop oil on it. People drop gum and butts on it. What's a bit of spit? Practise basic personal hygiene and you'll be fine. It's racism you need to worry about.
2210 2018-11-18 19:39:23 Exactly, but with an oink at the end  

The skins were scrumptious too...I scrub them, prick the skins, rub in a little olive oil & sprinkle with Herbamare seasoned salt. I don’t wrap them in foil.
2211 2018-11-18 19:39:19 Cut sprouts in half, coat *fully*[1] with olive oil, salt and thyme, and roast. You'll thank me.

2224 2018-11-18 19:37:11 Hi Tim: So in Alberta's case, is it provincial or federal taxpayers who are absorbing the losses? Do the oil companies have sweet heart deals with our governments to pass the losses onto the tax payers? How long can Canada sustain its export trade balance on negative earnings?
2225 2018-11-18 19:37:09 Argh I really hate this sweaty sticky nonsense. On most parts of my body i just secrete oil and then I try lie on my arm but the face oil and the arm oil hate each other and feel yucky.
2226 2018-11-18 19:37:09 There needs to be a campaign to ban palm oil imports to the UK and EU. There is no need for it. The UK gov needs to understand that with the right support UK farming can step up and help fill any supply gaps #brexit may cause.

2230 2018-11-18 19:36:40 Well, all they had was the inhalers. So I grabbed one of those to try it out. Stuff frankly is pretty amazing and smells good. The inhaler relives the pain for a bit but then it comes back so I ordered the 0.95oz bottle of oil from Amazon. TY for the heads up!

Bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age again and again, and sending in our troops to Iraq over fake WMD, all for the raison d'être of controlling oil fields, is an invasion.
Suck it up, Donnie. Your rhetoric is always just more #DogWhistles.
2252 2018-11-18 19:33:59 I have to go get my oil changed and it always gives me so much anxiety lmao I h8 myself
2253 2018-11-18 19:33:58 I believe there is something of a clause like that. Too bad they didn't include a 20 or 25 dollar benchmark guaranteed price for our oil in with this clause??
2254 2018-11-18 19:33:54 Next time you're in the supermarket you'll be compelled to check out the potatoes.
I like Maris Pipers for making roast potatoes. Par boil them, bash them and mix them in some butter/oil. Lovely and delicious.

2257 2018-11-18 19:33:43 I remember back in 4U I was doing a gogmazios solo for shits and giggles and he was doing the thing where he flies up and spits burning oil on everything but I pole vaulted with IG at the perfect moment and dunked him XD
2258 2018-11-18 19:33:42 Gov just have to allow sale of concentrates, make that available thru legal sale. Extraction is nothing New, oil and hashish have been around for as long as the cannabis it selfie.
2259 2018-11-18 19:33:42 Hey @Big_Orrin I was wondering...

Has anyone ever tried to calculate the value of a crude oil barrel (w.r.t quality, of course) based on the proportional total value of the products one can acquire from it?

Asking for a friend 

Plus it’d be interesting to see the discount 
2260 2018-11-18 19:33:37 Though they exempt oil sheiks.

2271 2018-11-18 19:31:48 Watching Chief Gbenga Daniels, it's obvious people suffer from low memory. The cause of Nigeria's recession that led to the Naira's devaluation could be traced pyramidally to the low price of oil in the int'l market. Oil price fell to as low as US$35 p/b in 2015. He forgot that.

2307 2018-11-18 19:27:35 Thanks.Apart from the strategic reasons for EZ (world’s largest oil importer), to close invoice, liability issuance & asset currency loop with its energy suppliers,its just plain odd that its oil majors run a persistent fx mismatch between consumer receipts & supplier payments.

2309 2018-11-18 19:27:03 Oil is the life blood of any economy. U.S is finally energy independent. No more wars over black gold!
2310 2018-11-18 19:27:01 You can tell it’s relatively modern because the oil is called “cooking oil” rather than “salad oil.”
2311 2018-11-18 19:27:00 Where do they squeeze the hobos to get johobo oil
2312 2018-11-18 19:27:00 That first half was a complete disaster. Ugh. The Titans’ house of horrors is Lucas Oil Stadium. #TitanUp
2313 2018-11-18 19:26:54 What's interesting to me is that @atiku is jostling the idea of giving onshore oil wells to state govts to explore and drill, as a means to handle community responsibility and security, while returning royalties to FG & settling resource control debate
2314 2018-11-18 19:26:49 The oil and gas industry has a tremendous body count and they all deserve to hang, just one person’s opinion
2315 2018-11-18 19:26:30 Here is the fastest way insurance companies will gain extra money, think of all of the cars that will be vandalized at a home game!
2316 2018-11-18 19:26:23 How about offering rooms for people with chemical sensitivities? Lose the TeaTree Oil.
2317 2018-11-18 19:26:21 The job is for transporting oil  therefore oil and gas related

2325 2018-11-18 19:25:10 You’re  showing your ignorance. These general contractors are construction firms that work on all types of construction jobs Einstein. Not “oil workers”.
2326 2018-11-18 19:25:09 Of all the young guys on tour, I only see Zverev, Thiem and Coric with the makeup to get over that hump but we'll see. That said, hoping the two Canadian kids get there in due time. Like both of their games but believe Felix to have the bigger upside of than Shapo.
2327 2018-11-18 19:24:48 Mechanics are top five most casually misogynistic. I asked him to run a synthetic oil change and he told me “well if you start synthetic, you gotta stay synthetic” and I said “yeah that’s why I asked for it”
2328 2018-11-18 19:24:23 And the fact that JELIS saw the same thing without the mineral oil issue provides strong evidence that the effects were real.

2332 2018-11-18 19:24:00 For risotto: 

Put chicken stock in small saucepan and heat to just under boil.

In larger saucepan, saute scallions in olive oil till translucent, then add garlic. Toss lightly. Add risotto (arborio) rice to pan and lightly toast for a minute or two.
2333 2018-11-18 19:23:52 I hope it works for you.  Screw taking all those pills and go for the natural.  stuff.  Ive been taking cbd oil for my back and stomach issues for a year now and it really does help.  SO does the green leaves lol

2335 2018-11-18 19:23:45 Sturgeon & her incompetent cronies like to talk about WM “chaos”.
Just imagine the clusterfuck right now had we voted to tear up the UK in 2014. Austerity on crack, crippling debt based on a false oil prospectus and a justice minister troll tweeting football fans.
2336 2018-11-18 19:23:41 They got nothing in the pipeline. I'm filling up mine with crude oil
2337 2018-11-18 19:23:30 You can also make some drops of oil in the water!
2338 2018-11-18 19:23:26 Dear @IndomieNigeria the choice of palm oil is the wrong of the Relish Chicken. Perform the magic of Onion Chicken on Relish and rebrand. 
Please add more pepper 
Thanks
2339 2018-11-18 19:23:23 No,   she thought they'd work pretty much straight away but we might have to try the alternative apoquel.  He's also on yumega oil which has a 3/4 week period before it starts working
2340 2018-11-18 19:23:15 
2341 2018-11-18 19:23:12 I actually agree that it would have been nice to have had a lower dose EPA/DHA "fish oil" arm or water.  Probably would have cost 10s of millions more, though. But it is implausible that effects on primary outcomes of the magnitude observed were caused by mineral oil.
2342 2018-11-18 19:23:10 Not exactly the same.   It’s stupid that we’re paying ~$1.50  being the country with one of the biggest oil reserves.  Our economy is suffering for not using the resources at our disposal.  We’re not exactly California to rely on solar and industry cannot be run on green energy

2347 2018-11-18 19:22:17 i dont know any fitting substitute for the palm oil, but the maggi is not as important
2348 2018-11-18 19:22:08 you might see some oil though *he gives a menacing grin*

2353 2018-11-18 19:21:33 It used to be the law that  taxes were to be payed in hemp.
Many wars were fought over it. 

90% of plastics, oil for car and gasoline can be made from it.
If we can legalize it, OPEC will lose its hold on the USA.

Anyone want to smoke it, as long as they don't DUI, OK with me.

I usually make a mix of aloe, coconut oil, rosemary and peppermint water, and a few drops of a scented oil as a spray.

2373 2018-11-18 19:19:28 Climate change rhetoric just a scam to get money for democratic agenda of new world order! Climate change has been going on since the beginning of time! Stop using oil, natural gas, gasoline cars! Do your part before you blame Trump! BTW,amazing how rich Al Gore got pushing it!!!
2374 2018-11-18 19:19:22 We also had an oil spill so fish is also avoided

2376 2018-11-18 19:19:18 I am embarrassed at the slowness and/or entire absence of response from Newfoundland & Labrador's political leaders about the offshore oil spill that happened yesterday. For a province that prides itself on its coastal culture, this is not enough. #SeaRoseSpill

2397 2018-11-18 19:17:22 That's good so I heard this is now same issue with drugs as we will buy straight from Natpham. That's the way forward Delta has done the same. Why can't we buy cooking oil direct from manufacturers @Busisa74

Majority asking for to be added is fake one.
2433 2018-11-18 19:12:20 His friend made oil from it
2434 2018-11-18 19:12:19 Saw these products in our local Walmart also.  Have you taken a moment to read the ingredients?  You may be surprised.... the oil contains alcohol.  A filler that is not good for your skin let alone your hair. 
2435 2018-11-18 19:12:17 DON"T GET ME STARTED! One of the most ridiculous policies we have, in addition to OIL SUBSIDIES!!! is support for corn which has been turned into bio-fuel. It takes more dirty energy to make than it saves! As far as helping the farmers, we're talking agribusiness in this case.

2442 2018-11-18 19:11:41 Correct. Since the meter is a measure of length and any amount of oil occupies a minimum volume of space, 250 meters of oil is literally no oil at all.

2447 2018-11-18 19:11:14 Climate change - it feels the focus gets lost on this raking crap and the debate over forest management. I'd like to bring the focus to the root of the cause - the Oil Companies and oil commodities, which I do not understand but I am trying. 
 Yes? @ellyn_gesell

As Xmas gift
2451 2018-11-18 19:10:47 LOOOOL I used to watch this but forgot everything about the show I only remember her needing oil to move her body and the fact that she's strong
2452 2018-11-18 19:10:38 Lol yeah...I don't dare do that. Too much oil in the belly pan. It's supposed to hit into the 50's this week. Should be able to crank her over.

2456 2018-11-18 19:10:03 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
2457 2018-11-18 19:09:55 I didn’t see Magwenya there. Cooking oil was not even on the shelves.
2458 2018-11-18 19:09:35 So you tout a mythical deficit,  hardly bodes well for how Scotlsnd is governed by Westminster. The only country to discover Oil and gas and be the poorer for it. It's time to go brexit only hastened the inevitable
2459 2018-11-18 19:09:31 So many of these flimflam conartist snake oil selling geriatric politicians need to go. I realize the quality of the choices is somewhat limited, but there is a point when they have had enough time on the tit. Can we not institute compound interest on failure?
2460 2018-11-18 19:09:24 Daddy plssss when are coming back, Ghana miss u rough rough oh specially Taadi Oil City
2461 2018-11-18 19:09:21 I am hoping to work another 20yrs but the oil business is still depressed here.  Might have to retrain and a modern monetarist just to keep up with twitter by then. My deficit can be someone elses surplus and the kids get to start off from scratch like I did.
2462 2018-11-18 19:09:11 #cpolitique Come on guys stop your BS when the oil rises there isn't just the gasoline price which takes a hit!!!! everything that is oil-based rises also...including your clothes, food (yes there's oil in your food!)...be smart! THINK!
2463 2018-11-18 19:09:05 Remember when an oil exec with close Putin ties was appointed to dismantle the State Department
2464 2018-11-18 19:09:03 This’ll be a relief to Putin because oil prices are down.
2465 2018-11-18 19:08:59 We-written to point out the hypocrisy of American policies in the the Middle East for imperialism and control of opium and oil: "Iraq is ill prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing big problems in the Middle East. Go home!"
2466 2018-11-18 19:08:54 Because they make magwinya with cooking oil and sell them at the corner street.
2467 2018-11-18 19:08:41 معاك في كل كلمه مجلس عار
2468 2018-11-18 19:08:39 This means emerging-market assets that have been battered by rising Treasury yields and dollar strength now look set to shine, according to Redeker. Lower oil prices and stable building material prices including those of iron ore and copper may augur an emerging market rally
2469 2018-11-18 19:08:36 Oil slick located on #thearchers
2470 2018-11-18 19:08:34 No it won't. Short term pain no worse than a Labour Government and then once the FTAs roll in it will be the biggest boost to the economy since oil was discovered in North Sea.
2471 2018-11-18 19:08:25 I tweeted lots on Yemen.  Now I call them to pick no more quarrels. Let all parties assemble for truth. And mend. Let every person in Yemen see the greatest future and let non allow negative outside influences. How many knew Yemen has lots of oil?  See,humans are ignorant.
2472 2018-11-18 19:08:07 When Alberta Separates from Canada, the real loss to Canada won’t be AB Oil or Beef or Grains or Technology or Lumber.   The real loss to Canada will be losing The People of Alberta and The Alberta Spirit!  Alberta will always succeed! #albertaseparation
2473 2018-11-18 19:08:04 I don’t condone any stealing from land that isn’t theirs, be it petrol or olives. Turkey taken both olive oil and petrol from Syria
2474 2018-11-18 19:08:01 Adding fuel to the bearish fire will be a slowing American economy, falling oil prices, a stabilizing Chinese currency and tighter liquidity in U.S. markets, Redeker said
2475 2018-11-18 19:07:56 Oil is king!
2476 2018-11-18 19:07:51 Yes, by all means ignore the gallon of oil so we can discuss the potatoes. But, don't let my successful weight loss and reclamation of health keep you from spouting more bullshit. Why let science get in the way of a good way to spread lies and mislead people?
2477 2018-11-18 19:07:50 David is sad #lowiq
2478 2018-11-18 19:07:48 It’s a ridiculous answer... oil is imported we all use oil. Our balance of payments is import heavy. It was one of Leavers reason that EU is bad.   Everyone is affected directly or indirectly!
2479 2018-11-18 19:07:43 Ooh can't wait to see the stories. I am torn between the oil and highlighter lol my lips get so dry with these new meds and I think an oil would work fab.  Can't wait to see your thoughts hun
2480 2018-11-18 19:07:43 this is simply untrue - the allocation of North Sea oil revenues on a “geographic” basis means Scotland gets what it would were we independent (as Scot Gov economists agree) (1/2)
2481 2018-11-18 19:07:28 if God didn't want Republicans to squander our resources and burn up the earth, he wouldn't have put so many in oil states or stripped science from most schools
2482 2018-11-18 19:07:26 Any full list of the ones that took Big Oil money? You know, so we can start campaigning against them now?
2483 2018-11-18 19:06:50 100% it's a factor. We saw the same thing from Murray when Lendl came on board. Ivan rarely gets the credit he deserves as a player but he almost never beat himself in big matches. Murray had a bad habit of melting at times & so does Zverev.
2484 2018-11-18 19:06:48 We would be a global energy leader if we could get oil to market for a fair world price. 

Imagine how many solar panels those lost billions could buy.
2485 2018-11-18 19:06:34 Ever since they decided their oil should benefit the masses instead of the 1%

2487 2018-11-18 19:06:24 1. An interesting piece. That said, China remains, and will remain some time into the future, a regional power. Their ability to project power beyond the region is small. Plenty of negative factors that impede China not least its dependence of imported oil (cf. WWII Japan).
2488 2018-11-18 19:06:22 Can’t wait for my CBD oil to come in the mail thank u @wownicebuttdude for inspiring me, 1 tweet is all it takes!!

Unfortunately, that oil belongs to the Russians and the  Saudis and is leaking all over our Democracy.
2495 2018-11-18 19:05:57 Of we cut 100% of the methane and got to the fantasy land that natural gas life-cycle GHGs are half of coal...

Fracking has made ~120 years of shale gas newly recoverable. Equivalent of 60 years of coal. 

Without accounting for fracked oil. 

Math. Science. Vision. Honesty.

2498 2018-11-18 19:05:40 And in the SE the oil patch is stalled.  Villages will be disorganized and turned back to the RM when the next big water treatment plant upgrade is required because the cost per capita will be too high. Dan D'Autremont has picked a good time to retire.

2501 2018-11-18 19:05:33 What makes no sense is vegans use palm oil in nearly every substitute they have and that cause more deaths to loads of animals
2502 2018-11-18 19:05:30 U.S. leads in nuclear energy production but it only makes up 20% of their total energy usage. Russia currently leads in oil production. U.S. leads in natural gas production. In spite of this, U.S. has not led any efforts to combat climate change.

2588 2018-11-18 18:54:20 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their pencil was out of lead
2589 2018-11-18 18:54:12 Less heat, get a trim, and castor oil!
2590 2018-11-18 18:54:06 Pour ten cups of olive oil then put back on heat.
2591 2018-11-18 18:53:42 I've never thought about where the money came from. And I've never seen/read mention of Walton H. Marshall and his fellow oil execs.
Now I can't wait until April for the follow-ups.

2593 2018-11-18 18:53:06 Don't buy any products that use palm oil and call the companies and tell them why. When they tell you that palm oil is "sustainable", call them out on it.
2594 2018-11-18 18:52:58 i keep a jar of coconut oil in every room of my house 
2595 2018-11-18 18:52:55 This week on “Niki’s Anxiety Makes Her Look Like A Moron”: I kept avoiding going to the auto stores in town to have them run diagnostics on it bc it made me so nervous...instead I drove an hour away to have my dad look at it. Turns out, just needed some oil  #hotmessexpress
2596 2018-11-18 18:52:51 …" The oil companies were now in bed with the nurse practitioners the which doctors in the Seregedes Plains and yet too many people had died through the years in front of tribal courts and yet to harass those natives Afrikanners who wanted to propagate their race through having

2598 2018-11-18 18:52:46 Easy butternut squash soup. Sauté 1 onion in 2T butter/oil, when it’s  browned add 2T curry powder, mix, add 4 cups cubed b. Squash, 1 chopped, peeled, granny apple and 4 cups broth. Pressure cook 10 mins. Natural release then purée. Serve w/fried sage and creme fraiche on top.

2600 2018-11-18 18:52:41 Has nothing to do with her football knowledge, but everything to do with someone helping to lie us into the Iraq War (a war for nothing more than taking oil away from the Iraqis) now, possibly, being rewarded with something like this.
2601 2018-11-18 18:52:38 i cannot stand looking at porn and seeing an ashy butt crack .  like baby , she need some oil or something . why are you recording this ?
2602 2018-11-18 18:52:36 Well, if you come across as a professional public speaker, well rehearsed, prepared for just about every reasonable/conceivable question u r not seeing their private persona only their professional public persona!!! Beware of slick talking snake oil sales person!!! Sucks for u.
2603 2018-11-18 18:52:32 End of second, Louie and HNIC raved about Oiler dominance, even Hrudey. Oil fans ecstatic!  Flat third, and Oil fans despondent, roster sucks, Todd needs to be fired.  And they wonder why "fickle" applies?

2608 2018-11-18 18:51:27 What is in a Mayo without oil? I thought that was kinda important to Mayo?
2609 2018-11-18 18:51:24 Perhaps we can also build pipelines so we are not dependent on their oil as well
2610 2018-11-18 18:51:21 Mueller has been previously Senate confirmed. Mueller isn’t a snake oil salesman like Whitaker! Penis adjusting toilets was it? 

Trumpy is trying to get Schiff  & his family harassed by his thug supporters!
2611 2018-11-18 18:51:18 Had that play been completed for a touchdown to Luck  Lucas Oil would have exploded! #Colts #ColtsNation #NFL
2612 2018-11-18 18:51:04 Fun fact. Exploding trees occur during forest fires and are a risk to smokejumpers. In California, the native eucalyptus trees are also known to explode during bush fires due to the high flammability of vaporised eucalyptus oil produced by the tree naturally.
2613 2018-11-18 18:50:59 The ENTIRE gym smells like patchouli oil right now and it’s fucking awful.
2614 2018-11-18 18:50:59 Coconut oil mixed with olive oil and rosemary. Heat in the mwave for 1.5 minutes. Apply to your face. Massage for two minutes (esp the forehead) then wash with a gentle soap and washcloth. Finish w/a face cream.
Do every day. Every damn day. Shd see a difference in about a week.
2615 2018-11-18 18:50:55 No stuffing in bird. Make separate. Make sure you take the heart, neck and gizzard out before you cook it. Stuffing in bird dries the turkey out. Coat the bird with butter, spread or oil and salt and pepper before you put it in the bag. A meat thermometer is good to be sure.

2617 2018-11-18 18:50:49 Have you checked your oil lately? Do you need an oil change? Straight from the mouth of Bishop RJ Burt.. change your oil! Take it off the shelf and bless everyone and thing! Indeed I have open my jar and poured... poured.. all blessing in Jesus name amen...
2618 2018-11-18 18:50:42 Just knocked my oil change out now I gotta wash this joint
2619 2018-11-18 18:50:19 That would have BLOWN the freaking roof of Lucas Oil Stadium had Andrew Luck caught his first ever catch
2620 2018-11-18 18:50:11 Didn't the B-24 raid of the Ploesti oil fields become a battle tactic adopted by the USAF and other Air Forces?
2621 2018-11-18 18:50:08 That's fine by me. I make sweets and cakes for the family anyways. I want to know what they eat, not the crap that comes in a package, full of rubbish like palm oil.
2622 2018-11-18 18:50:07 Lemon as in the fresh fruit?

Which oil did you use? Magnolia?
2623 2018-11-18 18:50:04 I don't know if that was the spot to run that, but if Luck caught it Lucas Oil would have exploded
2624 2018-11-18 18:49:59 hey everyone don’t own a car. ever. this 3 hour wait for an oil change is Not Worth It
2625 2018-11-18 18:49:50 If you're prone to ear infections, look to garlic oil for its antibacterial properties. Use a dropper to apply warm garlic oil inside ear.
2626 2018-11-18 18:49:49 @IcelandFoods your advert has really struck a chord with me, I’m embarrassed to be a human being. I’m pledging to significantly reduce the amount of non sustainable palm oil and it’s derivatives that I consume. I hope other people do the same
2627 2018-11-18 18:49:48 Ohhh if Luck makes that catch Lucas Oil would've lost it's mind
2628 2018-11-18 18:49:39 So much to worry about: 1,000 people still missing in #ButteCountyFire , people in #WestVirginia ripped off by oil and gas industry (which control politics in the state) incipient #Fascism in #America, incompetent #POTUS, corrupt #SCOTUS , #Old and falling apart.
2629 2018-11-18 18:49:12 Notice that Israel has to IMPORT its crude oil.

2633 2018-11-18 18:48:55 I want bread, cheese and oil.
2634 2018-11-18 18:48:54 indeed, which would happen if and when the petrodollar is separated and oil starts trading for something other than.
2635 2018-11-18 18:48:51 This mint oil got me feeling telepathic , my brain feel like its getting a good scrub
2636 2018-11-18 18:48:34 Take that shit to the counter and tell them you want a discount. Then go home and put dish soap on it and let it soak for 5 mins before washing to get the oil out. Works every time.
2637 2018-11-18 18:48:34 No oil no fracking. No insects no pesticides. Accessing the wealth of the heavens is a way to better our planet, IMHO.
2638 2018-11-18 18:48:10 Nobody wants to hear that oil price was $28 when we passed the budget and the President insisted that we must manage what we have.

Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi
2639 2018-11-18 18:47:50 Oh really? I hope you will come soon and if you want any information you may ask me anytime. Yes, our river Rhine is to dry for the shipment and so prices for oil and other things are becoming much more expensive...
2640 2018-11-18 18:47:49 I been at Walmart since 10:30 tryna get an oil change .... I’m still here 
2641 2018-11-18 18:47:47 bananas, coconut oil... For just cooking in it, obviously, coconut or other oils. Well done wit going vegan. :)
2642 2018-11-18 18:47:36 Do you chop off the top and brush with olive oil? Then roast?
2643 2018-11-18 18:47:33 They did what exactly? 
It took three decades for oil to get to $140.
2644 2018-11-18 18:47:26 @realDonaldTrump is a snake oil salesman and a certain group of stupid folks just keep on gulping it up. Imagine what he has lied about and not gotten caught for it yet
2645 2018-11-18 18:47:12 This guy is dead and all y’all care about is solar power and oil. Smh 
2646 2018-11-18 18:47:09 Saudis can but in a few years time they will be begging the world to buy there OIL when cars go Electric
2647 2018-11-18 18:47:09 Had chocolate earlier no palm oil for me #DropDirtyPalmOil
2648 2018-11-18 18:46:50 What about global oil reserves and supply? How does America compare to rest of oil based economies on these two measures. How do we stack up against the #OPEC nations?
2649 2018-11-18 18:46:47 Trump is looking out for Trump and big businesses. His admin and the congress has rolled back checks on the banking industry, oil and coal, and given large amounts of $ back to companies and the 1%. He's not fixing the issues that either of our sides are worried about.
2650 2018-11-18 18:46:39 “Lucas Oil is loud with the roof closed.” ~ Mike Keith @titansradio 

Brother, you ain’t heard Lucas Oil loud. Come visit in August for @dci Finals, then talk to me about how loud it is today.
2651 2018-11-18 18:46:34 That and assessing what's "divisive" based on subjective opinions about means is a non sequitur.
One has to define what is unifying to properly define what divides.
If people need oil but Cathy is so privileged she can choose to live differently, her assumptions are arrogance.
2652 2018-11-18 18:46:28 Soon as I get home I’m on the oil

2654 2018-11-18 18:46:24 Is there an NRA for oil companies or something?
2655 2018-11-18 18:46:18 It is all associated gas that cant get to the market produced as a byproduct from Bakken #shale. #Natgas had become essentially a waste product from liquids and light oil focused drilling. But the U.S. added LNG export quick and demand is growing. More then justified imo.
2656 2018-11-18 18:46:17 FG  DOESN'T DETERMINE  OIL PRICE
2657 2018-11-18 18:46:17 Provenance says I can’t afford it. I like it though, maybe Jim will invest in my Dublin oil idea
2658 2018-11-18 18:46:04 Yehp can burn i've been there, so lemon and lotion mixed with a good oil did the trick
2659 2018-11-18 18:45:57 Haven’t purchased ANYTHING by this company since the first Palm Oil incursion into their products- plenty of good alternatives in NZ..
2660 2018-11-18 18:45:56 Sask farmers rely on Parabolic pyrolysis to convert Hemp biomass to charcoal in order to neutralize all the alkaline in the soil and aquifer water, oil industry is a degenerate waste hence the carbon tax model, the next generation deserves a thriving Hemp nanotechnology industry
2661 2018-11-18 18:45:49 I don't doubt that pipelines would expand customer base, just don't see how they will raise bitumen prices. Real problem for oilsands is end of Bunker oil in ships, rapid adoption of renewables.
2662 2018-11-18 18:45:47 The smear campaign by the U.S. oil industry seems to be working. They are turning Canadians away from wanting an oil pipeline. Soon only U.S. oil will be exported.
2663 2018-11-18 18:45:46 Pipe dream. The evil orange sociopath is just a symptom of the great sickness on the RT of US. GOP/FOX/BREITBART/INFOWARS/RUSH/EVILGELICALS/NAZIS/THE ULTRA RICH/BIG OIL are the bulwark against fairness, equality, good governance, truth, the greater good, morality, human rights.
2664 2018-11-18 18:45:46 especially if upon opening you dont feel enough value. At this price point u should open a box and be happy regardless what u get. In general its a bad gamble. Not to be a hypocrite ill crack a few boxes , be bummed out , vow not to buy more  until the next snake oil

2670 2018-11-18 18:45:16 Hahaha She-ra is pretty entertaining gosh the neckbeards need to focus more on exfoliation and moisturizing so their grimy bristle pest nests stop getting gummed up with rashy skin flakes and oil that are making them so sensitive to a kid's show for girls.
2671 2018-11-18 18:45:13 Man I love a morning where you're cooking and then oil just splatters on your face :)
2672 2018-11-18 18:45:08 i don't know who in their right mind takes 5 even 10 minutes to do an oil change. i wouldn't trust that at all, coming from someone who works in the industry.
2673 2018-11-18 18:45:08 If you're going keto as a vegetarian, getting enough plant-based fat can be challenging... and you can only eat so many avocados. Adding coconut oil & olive oil to your favorite foods is a great hack. Consider adding high-fat dairy, cheeses, and fatty nuts (like walnuts) as well.
2674 2018-11-18 18:45:07 No amount of clumsiness has ever been reached 
Also, my speakers were affected by the oil flood, your thoughts and prayers are stongly needed

2681 2018-11-18 18:43:23 Today we are paying the cost of happiness we have enjoyed in the past govt in terms of high oil prices, heavy exhange rates and all the associated items. If they had made the Uturn...atleast we would be happy today.

2693 2018-11-18 18:42:19 Your opening statement on SM is not correct in true sense. Not sure what you are referencing that oil legally barred from competing in Canada. Regarding your last statement shows you're unaware of the full topic. It's not 4% in total...Wow is right.
2694 2018-11-18 18:42:06 I am pretty certain someone somewhere in Malaysia had this same sentiment with regards to competing against Nigeria's Oil palm prowess some decades back. Luckily for them, they didn't listen to that person. We can argue about the corruption that may derail the subsidy sha.

2696 2018-11-18 18:41:51 What does their "Swept (forest) floors" have to do with their Health Care system? What it DOES have to do with is they BURN all that wood to help keep warm. Heating oil or natural gas is prohibitively expensive due to excessive tax on it.

2709 2018-11-18 18:40:13 Yep, the WH is running like a finely oiled machine, thanks to the oil from mbs in Saudi Arabia. Nice whine about the WP - basically crying out for them to call him .  Otherwise, a "normal" trumpian reply
2710 2018-11-18 18:40:11 I’m so confused by it now. As I was reading. That it’s actually better to use sustainable palm oil than boycott palm oil altogether.
2711 2018-11-18 18:40:09 Baby oil

2715 2018-11-18 18:39:49 a wise man once said that when 45 lies, a sad wolf dreams about being a #Democrat
2716 2018-11-18 18:39:49 Worst step backwards in recent history of the U.K.

Since the rest is just smoke and snake oil, basically you’re taking away away rights from all U.K. citizens...
2717 2018-11-18 18:39:22 Baby, they try to con everyone straight or not!  I once had a shop tell me I needed about $3,000 worth of work. I went in for an oil change!  Trust me, they prey on everyone. Just tell them “No, thank you!” Stay firm!
2718 2018-11-18 18:39:17 Lmfaoo i ain’t say shit bout the oil that was danny cause she allergic to fish I just said I wasn’t eating it it’s nasty and I had no choice I wasn’t gon starve lmao
2719 2018-11-18 18:39:05 In the supermarket and my kids notice there’s palm oil in their favourite granola... they put it back on the shelf because “they would feel really guilty eating it”. The @IcelandFoods advert has made them v aware #prouddad
2720 2018-11-18 18:38:59 coconut oil has changed my life once again
2721 2018-11-18 18:38:46 And btw, a system that has been advertised as feasible but never delivered is called snake oil in my country, what do you call it in yours?

Serious question.

2722 2018-11-18 18:38:36 Resuming the export of #Kirkuk’s oil to the #Turkish port of Ceyhan via a pipeline part-managed by the #Kurdistan Regional Government (#KRG) is unlikely to benefit the disputed province itself, Kirkuk provincial council’s oil and gas committee chief said Sunday.
2723 2018-11-18 18:38:35 Interesting fact I read, apparently suicide rates are highest among men that work in construction and extraction (oil rigging, mining, etc), and women that work in arts, design and entertainment.
2724 2018-11-18 18:38:35 our tactics wer poor at the end of the day besides the slippery dry pitch... and rusike daakasapihwa cooking oil ... how can we go and play defensive against a team we won 3-0 in the earlier fixture.... hauone Liverpool or City go n play defensive against Man U or Cardiff

2729 2018-11-18 18:38:08 Use oil to keep the hairs hydrated w wax to style the moustache and you'll be good
2730 2018-11-18 18:38:07 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
2731 2018-11-18 18:38:05 What's that word before oil?
2732 2018-11-18 18:38:04 B isn't likely to happen. With the way this country is higher oil prices = increased subsidy payments. We're hustling backwards walahi
2733 2018-11-18 18:37:56 40/41 API Light sweet dry crude oil.

2735 2018-11-18 18:37:29 They want in on that oil money.
2736 2018-11-18 18:37:18 I am trying to get more info from you but all you have is that 1.3% of his contributions come from oil/gas and to you that makes him beholden to that sector. By that very same logic you should be more concerned with the several Universities that donated far more $ to him
2737 2018-11-18 18:37:16 Why do some cannabis producers make candy that looks like children’s candy? I think people should be 100% sure that none of their edibles have ingredients that could negatively impact children and others. Cannabis oil could also be dangerous because it can be added to foods.
2738 2018-11-18 18:37:00 Thank you oman oil..luv from the heart  
2739 2018-11-18 18:36:59 Great running bike. Just added new saddle bags. Stored inside. Just had safety inspection done and fresh oil change done 500 miles ago.

2741 2018-11-18 18:36:42 Resist the #HiddenLiberalAgenda how can a small country of #Israel surrounded by Arab countries be the bad guy? If they need to help Palestinians ehh won’t they offer them placeim their oil rich country? #MuslimHypocrisy
2742 2018-11-18 18:36:38 Lol nah , but expensive.
2743 2018-11-18 18:36:36 getting my car’s #oil changed even though it should’ve been changed a #year ago
2744 2018-11-18 18:36:35 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
2745 2018-11-18 18:36:30 I don’t think any party supported olympics, but’s it’s only the current leadership blocking all infrastructure in oil & gas which directly affects Albertans. Also making a deal two weeks a before plebiscite or tying funding to plebiscite is not full fledged support. Tepid at best
2746 2018-11-18 18:36:27 Tea tree oil helped mine heal super fast!

2750 2018-11-18 18:36:01 What's sad is the people in West Virginia have been tricked into believing the GOP is looking out for them, when they are supporting Oil & Gas companies as they exploit people. They LITERALLY vote against their own self interest out of ignorance and fear.
2751 2018-11-18 18:35:59 Can confirm this is good for sprouts, split them in half for the saute if you want some yummy nutty browning on the insides. High heat with a neutral oil that won't smoke helps get them done quickly before they get stinky. I like to saute them with lil sun dried tomato slices
2752 2018-11-18 18:35:57 Lucas Oil and Bridgestone have the same mixtape
2753 2018-11-18 18:35:43 Adding coconut oil into my pre-poo did wonders. My hair was so easily to detangle.
2754 2018-11-18 18:35:41 Wow! Interesting
2755 2018-11-18 18:35:38 Does anyone wanna go in on a few barrels of oil? Retirement fund for 50 years when that shit is 5000000 a gallon
2756 2018-11-18 18:35:29 Justin Trudeau inherited a 2nd Conservative recession, a global crash in oil prices, stagnant economic growth for a decade, and stagnant wage growth. And now we have a booming economy, lowest unemployment in 40 years, and fastest growing wages in a decade.

2761 2018-11-18 18:35:10 I’m super intrigued. I’m looking for info on if the poly fully degrades or just breaks apart a bit. If the latter, it’s quicker microplastics. Either way, at mass scale, could become an issue of oil to poly to co2 in atmosphere
2762 2018-11-18 18:35:07 Really? They only reason that the elderly weren’t put out on the street after the 2008 crash was because they continued to get their SS checks. And not one of the crooks went to jail. The reason we don’t take action on climate change is big oil.
2763 2018-11-18 18:34:55 our language's latin roots is based off the same dialect as monegasque and french.  lang d'oil and italian

It's been real since our fantastic earth was formed.

Stop preaching to us & deal w/ the Corporates.
When Henry Ford developed a soya based plastic car & fuel, the plans were "lost" & Getty did Saudi oil deal.
2770 2018-11-18 18:33:48 Why can’t I find my damn charger to my oil pen like I never lost it now this
2771 2018-11-18 18:33:45 Nations that are jealous of other nations because they cannot , by themselves be imaginative and make their Nations work. Like the nations of the North. The Muslims. They have become dependant on the money from oil and no work for it, they cannot work for themselves
2772 2018-11-18 18:33:44 Is this really true? Can you document that increased demand for rapeseed leads to more deforestation than palm oil?
2773 2018-11-18 18:33:43 @pepsi STOP THE USE OF PALM OIL !!! I will now not be buying any Pepsi products #ShameOnYou #savetheorangutans #changeyourways #bigcooperationidiots #whatisthisworldcomingto

2778 2018-11-18 18:32:57 Build the pipeline, stop the lies. Oil is used in the production of over 6,000 different products. Everything from clothing to your tv. Don't stop jobs, don't cause price hikes.
2779 2018-11-18 18:32:41 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

2780 2018-11-18 18:32:36 Putin is totally unafraid of any tiny uprising in his country that he rules with an iron fist. Regardless of Sunni or Shiite, destabilizing OPEC nations clearly would benefit Russian Oil, which represents 46% of that country's total exports. Always follow the money to the truth.

2783 2018-11-18 18:32:28 She is so ignorant, but the “squeaky wheel gets the oil”. How about it Republicans, can you squeak a little louder?You better stop trying to grandstand and do nothing,or all of our children will not have a country worth living in.Treason!!!
2784 2018-11-18 18:32:23 Marlon Mack barrels in for the TD. Colts with the 7-0 lead.

Crowd at Lucas Oil is amped up today. Could be because of the legends in the house, could be the potential of 4 wins in a row. 

Either way, it's a fun atmosphere.

2789 2018-11-18 18:32:05 This is all part if the long con... pay attention to all this other stuff while he isolates us in the world economy. Only then will he cut off the Saudis and say the media forced him back into bed with uncle Vlad . Imagine the cost of oil when that happens.
2790 2018-11-18 18:31:51 Look no further than the hundreds of thousands of French that are out in the streets demanding Macron' s ouster because he is enforcing the people-hating policies of the Paris accords... it is a tax sham.. forcing Nations to impose taxes on fuel and heating oil
2791 2018-11-18 18:31:28 Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S because it is all a BIG CON More than 4 Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast Today

2800 2018-11-18 18:30:17 PDP paid off the debt buhari and his fellow coupist borrowed and looted with oil price at $20. If you convert the price of oil with the current exchange rate you would see that buhari is earning more from oil price

2802 2018-11-18 18:30:01 I haven't tried the oil, but smoking pot helped my anxiety tremendously before diagnosis.  My psychiatrist told me that marijuana is great for ASD.  I've found that for me, the antipsychotic Abilify works even better than marijuana for the massive anxiety associated with autism.
2803 2018-11-18 18:29:57 Not to mention the oil filled eucalyptus trees.

2816 2018-11-18 18:28:30 Vonk did say that . But the Hard Fact Figures are that #UKOG are indeed producing  alot of oil From the Kimmeridge. To imply it doesn't or won't is total rubbish . Watch KL4 The big one!

If and when #Brockham start producing all well and good . But it hasn't been tested yet.
2817 2018-11-18 18:28:19 For someone who lives down the street from Lucas Oil, this might seem small. To paying fans far from a regional or finals who've had to settle for sun-baked metal bleachers in tiny venues in this market going into a dome, then locked back to a HS field, it's not.
2818 2018-11-18 18:28:18 I work in the oil n gas sector and the sanity there is something I never thought we would see. There are more changes to be made though and clarity of the PIB will be good for us all. Glad FG does not owe unlike in days of plenty and debts.
2819 2018-11-18 18:28:18 Thanks for the reply, however I just feel that you’re saying one thing and doing another. If you feel that strongly about Palm Oil, then stop stocking products that contain them and claiming that you are proud to be able to offer consumers choice! #justsaying

2824 2018-11-18 18:27:30 It did! But between soaking them in milk, washing them with dish soap and olive oil, and repeatedly scrubbing them with rubbing alcohol, I got it down enough that I could sleep. Now I've just got some light burning at the joints and under my fingernails

2832 2018-11-18 18:25:54 They did. But oil went to $140 a barrel. Alberta & Canada took full advantage of that. Are you suggesting they should have turned away from that? We live in a free-markets economy.

I think it is a good and very important message, and what it actually says is about reducing palm oil usage, and protecting the Jungles habitat of orang utans. Problem?

2854 2018-11-18 18:23:42 Very interesting. Maybe related to fact that Germany actually doesn’t have an oil major (unlike Total, Repsol and ENI)? So question is what firms are doing the importing?
2855 2018-11-18 18:23:17 **PSA*** if you have an oil diffuser & a doggy- tea tree oil is toxic to dogs!! even just through the air, it’s bad for them!!

2857 2018-11-18 18:23:03 .@Oreo needs to stop using ingredients that cause deforestation. Their use of dirty palm oil is inexcusable. Please do not buy Oreo cookies until they come up with recipes that use earth friendly ingredients.
2858 2018-11-18 18:23:02 These "results" are so few among the total pool of climate research as to be nearly rendered statistically insignificant, but demonstrate a disproportionate showing among conspiracy theory contrarians who think oil companies would tell the truth about their industry's impact.
2859 2018-11-18 18:22:59 Or maybe I need some more CBD oil?
2860 2018-11-18 18:22:41 Whole cauliflower roasting in the oven....bit of oil, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt and pepper. Smells divine!

2864 2018-11-18 18:22:10 Not for money. Not for oil!
2865 2018-11-18 18:22:05 The American government does not want free electricity.  Too many politicians think that that is the desire of ‘big oil’.  But I have seen many situations where oil companies are rebranding themselves as energy companies, and are doing the research and development to make it so.
2866 2018-11-18 18:21:59 Most likely he didnt.  He preached diversifying into 8 different commodities.  The root cause is complex but key factors causing the demise is a complex combination of selling naked, big losses on crude oil sell puts, too early sell NG calls, big vega explosions. He’s a veteran.
2867 2018-11-18 18:21:58 Ikr!!!!  The oil just di make us shine well well. Only cholesterol .
2868 2018-11-18 18:21:44 I believe this is not a true production increase but a push to market by producers who had oil stored onsite.

2874 2018-11-18 18:21:30 The thing is, right now, I kinda got where I want cause the range is really not much of an issue after all but I always tough the gaz station were making more money from the customers it attracts then from pure oil revenues... this is $$$ to take in a growing EV world.

2882 2018-11-18 18:20:48 Alright let’s see what this CBD oil is all about.
2883 2018-11-18 18:20:32 What part of taxing oil and cow farts as a national tax confuses you. It's a Tax.
2884 2018-11-18 18:20:26 It's dangerous if you don't follow basic rules. Use a thermometer, don't use a frozen turkey, don't hey the oil too hot. It's quite easy, but people do dumb shit and think it will be ok. Not with that much hot oil!

2892 2018-11-18 18:19:19 Not exactly. The concept usually is that you don’t take money by anyone. Be it the oil and gas industry or the solar panel industry. Be it the pharma giants or the doctors lobby. You just don’t take money and in a working system you don’t have to.
2893 2018-11-18 18:19:16 I get what you are saying but let’s be real here that 429k is 1.3% of his total contributions. To be clear I am very anti big oil. Extremely anti oil. But slamming Beto for taking money from them is coming up short for me. If that is all the evidence you have then I’m not buying

2938 2018-11-18 18:14:08 Congrats!!! Not a lot of people understand how much it takes to do this. It’s a rough adjustment (well at least for me it was) but it’s so liberating. Keep putting castor oil and that should help with most of the hair loss issues you had.

2956 2018-11-18 18:11:33 You are not going to have to learn a lot more about the weather. You actually will have to consult scientific research instead of what lobbies dictate to push oil for instance. Perhaps ask the insurance industry about your home insurance in the future...

we haven't been in a necessary war since the 1940's.

it's all about the oil, siphoning money to the arms manufacturers, and political/$ payoffs.

or it may be about human sacrifice.  but, it's not about protecting our country.  we haven't been believably threatened.

2998 2018-11-18 18:06:44 Setting aside this particular event re consolidation, the larger trend is still away from oil and gas. Eg. We have an air source heat pump good to -35 C. No natural gas. Next goals are solar panels and an electric car. Net zero homes found in N Europe. It's doable #Renewables
2999 2018-11-18 18:06:44 Here Is trying to figure out how much hemp oil and THC should be used in a brownie recipe. Yes, I live California and that was my first thought. There must be a google site for pot recipes.

3001 2018-11-18 18:06:08 That actually makes conservatives angry. Low oil costs means lower profit margins, meaning minimizing workforce for the oil industry, a predominantly conservative workforce
3002 2018-11-18 18:06:05 Does Nigeria control dollars?  My brother the rise in the price of  dollar is a global thing it is just unfortunate that it happened now. And I also want to tell me what was the price of crude oil from 1999-2015 including Nigerian external reserve

3005 2018-11-18 18:05:41 I see palm oil is making the rounds as the Big Bad Destructive Thing again, cool how we care about orangutan rainforests now but not other forms of deforestation, the massive environmental impact of the meat industry in general, other byproducts produced by exploitation, etc.
3006 2018-11-18 18:05:31 Niggas be bitchin about paying for that punk ass 87. Nigga I WISH my shit took 87. We not gonna even touch oil changes

3009 2018-11-18 18:05:13 Melbana and Tag Oil JV'd to drill Puka into the Tikorangi. They hoped to define that the Waihapa to Puka distance was one reservoir. Only mother earth knows that answer. 3D seismic + Downhole data is needed to Tie the geology and drilling and seismic into one data set 1/3
3010 2018-11-18 18:05:08 The price of oil has always been controlled by just a few people. How's this any different?

3020 2018-11-18 18:04:34 We had one once. America has always benefitted capitalism, destroyed countries with rich oil & mineral reserves American corporations want to steal, but most people were content, & ignored that. Now, besieged; like parting the sea, half are moving to the right & half to the left!

3025 2018-11-18 18:04:13 America also was ( and is ) eating the planet. ( you think about oil I am speaking about water ). Both of them would take care of their look but would eat everything for money in the background.
We run out of oil we are alive again. ( If we don't eat each other nobody eats us)

3029 2018-11-18 18:04:04 Trump is just saying out loud what past presidents have not said. We don't care what the saudis do as long as they keep oil prices stable and support israel. The relationship hasn't changed since trump admin. Trump just has no ability to keep it looking pretty.

3037 2018-11-18 18:02:53 Its interesting that a majority of Calgarians voted no for the olympics. I personally feel it was a smart choice for their economy, seeing as there economy is strongly influenced by oil and is already struggling. Very awesome that tax payers had a voice!
3038 2018-11-18 18:02:46 Tag Oil's Cheal-B5 well that is currently offline, but previously only produced from the Mt. Messenger formation. The real exploration potential comes from the deeper Tikorangi formation The high pressure high flow rates are the prize of Tikorangi. Thats why Puka was drilled 2/2

3040 2018-11-18 18:02:24 Cerave and Cetaphil are both decent drugstore options. I don't like spending a lot of money on something I'm going to wash off. I also use a foaming oil cleanser from Softymo that I order from Amazon.

3047 2018-11-18 18:01:58 Suhus can conc on making their "trend" No 1 Instead of lecturing us 

All I can say is " don't add oil to burning fire" 
3048 2018-11-18 18:01:55 I still cannot do it since the water coming from my hair will flow down on my face and we all know how dirty our hair usually are from all the dried skin, dust, dandruffs, oil. I usually just wash my face after i shower
3049 2018-11-18 18:01:53 Any essential oil is good tbh. Coconut , tea tree, olive. The list goes on. As Ling as it says 100% on it . Also can never go wrong with Jamaican castor oil 
3050 2018-11-18 18:01:53 Bloomberg is reporting there are three men that control oil prices now.  Trump, Putin, and crown Prince Mohammed Bim Salman.  The U.S., Russia, ans Saudi Arabia produce the most oil.

3061 2018-11-18 18:00:49 Remember Tag Oil has neighbor, (New Zealand Energy) who are also using waterfloods to recover more oil.

The Urenui and Mt. Messenger are shallower intervals (low cost, low hanging fruit),

3070 2018-11-18 17:59:41 It’s not economics, rather geology employed for an economic purpose like finding oil or minerals. Contrast with academic geology whose purpose is pure knowledge.
3071 2018-11-18 17:59:26 @marksandspencer I don’t know where I’m going to shop anymore as palm oil is alarmingly in so many of your products. Do you have any plans to change this now that #palmoil has become an important issue for so many shoppers?
3072 2018-11-18 17:59:18 If that's what he wants he needs to stop selling off land to oil companies, stop dumping coal ash in rivers, stop turning back epa regulations. Oh wait, there's no profit in that is there? Whoops!

3076 2018-11-18 17:58:36 buckets of water??..ur family doesn't like u that much...a loving family usually pours u with buckets loaded with mud or used oil..thats if they don't have super
3077 2018-11-18 17:58:35 Good. I never use anything with palm oil. I use beef suet. I used to get it from the butcher but he seems to buy meat already cut up at the wholesalers. I used to get the job of chopping it up and removing the membranes when I was little.
3078 2018-11-18 17:58:28 He’s fear mongering. Oil sands will continue to be developed for many years to come, just not at the same levels as prior to 2015/2008.
3079 2018-11-18 17:58:17 What if, instead of over-production, they'd used some of Big Oil's  profits for green initiatives / alternate energy sources?! 
   This is what they AREN'T saying: Even Conservatives know Carbon Taxes Work. 
     It does not, however, put dollars into the pockets of the rich.
3080 2018-11-18 17:58:09 FOM is purely a mechanism to use skills where they are needed - this designed to oil the wheels of the wider EU economy. Your wilful neglect of the controls provided in EU law to restrict movement to workers only has led us to this unholy mess.

3088 2018-11-18 17:56:43 All that would be required to make it worthy of discussion is for an ND to cite controlled, randomized, double blinded studies published in credible peer reviewed journals that show that the snake oil they push actually works.

3092 2018-11-18 17:56:02 I just googled and found coconut and olive oil listed as substitutes. And *I Can't Believe it's Not Butter*--Vegan Spread-- is given as a commercial option as well.

3096 2018-11-18 17:55:20 The funniest? thing I've learned recently is the slave trade in Africa basically ended because of the rise of palm oil production (more profitable.) Capitalism...is bad.

3098 2018-11-18 17:55:06 No, this is an incorrect statement. There is no way that the primary drive of climate change is population. This is to skew the picture. Of course the more people in the oil system the worse the situation, but the numbers of humans is not in any real sense the core issue.

3100 2018-11-18 17:54:51 this bitch literally brought a whole ass bag of essential oils onto the plane and she’s taking them out explaining to the poor woman next to her how she created an ANTI VIRAL OIL AND ofFErREd heR sOMe??? now this plane smell like some tea tree oil lmfao
3101 2018-11-18 17:54:39 You are incorrect. Banks have asked them to consolidate, which is why so many are closing up shop. They are selling their interests to large corporations. Oil will be around for 50 years or more until the technology to replace it is developed.
3102 2018-11-18 17:54:28 We will worship like oil
3103 2018-11-18 17:54:24 @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @foxnation @PeteHegseth @ENERGY Why are we not out of oil?? All through the 80's & 90's you all assured us we would be?? Lies lies lies!!

3105 2018-11-18 17:53:45 So do you fly in jets drive a car use a computer or use natural gas to heat your home Tzeporah ? So if you do you are a hypocrite and your full of bullshit. Canada is a carbon sink and this helps our trees grow you quack. The only oil industry you oppose is Canadian oil.
3106 2018-11-18 17:53:40 Meantime the Americans are pumping more Oil than the Saudis. Texas economy has exploded at such a crazy pace they are going to have to include them in the G7 pretty soon. #WakeUpCanada
3107 2018-11-18 17:53:36 You know what? Screw it. Let’s dump oil on the fire. Make her the new HC. That would be bananas if politicians could make the cross over to coaching in professional sports.
3108 2018-11-18 17:53:30 I had a 1996 Dodge and when I gave it to my son, it had 330.000 miles on it and only put a oil pump and water pump and the usual maintenance. My 2004 Gmc has 190,000 on it. And it runs like a top. So others I had were lemons. So I don't give any truck above the others.
3109 2018-11-18 17:53:26 Well that's if it's proper scars
If not try bio oil for three months and if that doesn't help then try derma Rolling

3114 2018-11-18 17:52:44 To be consistent, they'd need to devolve the oil revenues even further, to Shetland. Or is that somehow different?
3115 2018-11-18 17:52:20 My Gma ordered cannabis oil from Thai tv lmao
3116 2018-11-18 17:52:18 Just like Buhari has monopolised the oil sector already.
3117 2018-11-18 17:52:17 Obama administration was a contradiction. They spread talking points about climate change around the world, subsidized green energy companies, and became the largest oil producer. Nancy? Only aca passed, which was Romney care, without any Republican votes lol and she wants PAYGO!
3118 2018-11-18 17:51:38 Tell Liz to help get our troops Hope from Iraq where your dad sent them so his oil buddies could make billions.#badVP
3119 2018-11-18 17:51:30 We send the worlds most discounted oil down to Washington state where it is refined and sold back to us at world prices, 4x the cost. But you’re happy.
3120 2018-11-18 17:51:21 Every soldier that died for the USA died for a illegal cause to Steel oil for Corporate America. Hey USA, how about leaving Earth alone?
3121 2018-11-18 17:51:11 Like all the oil money....pissed away winning elections to reduce tax by 1p.
3122 2018-11-18 17:51:10 Trouble is it's hard to see how, with the quantities you're producing and the low prices you sell at, the palm oil you use can be truly sustainable. And as for the changes to #Packaging - not happening quickly enough. Just words.

3126 2018-11-18 17:50:54 Because of inflated oil lol. When it runs out, they are back to living in their tents.

CCP will fall apart like the Bolsehviks in just a matter of time as well.
3127 2018-11-18 17:50:52 Between 1955 and 1980, more than 50 corporations left New York City, including IBM, Gulf Oil, Texaco, Union Carbide, General Telephone, Xerox, PepsiCo, and U.S. Tobacco.
Connecticut exploited that trend to build itself into an economic powerhouse thru deals like Cuomo just did.
3128 2018-11-18 17:50:37 could do with some this was just bath stuff cbd oil your on about
3129 2018-11-18 17:50:30 It’s safer for my windows if I have wine. I also have a diffuser on with lavender oil pumping out 
3130 2018-11-18 17:50:26 my friends hair is just like yours and he uses my bella curls leave in conditioner and ors wrapping mouse with hawaiian silky and a little black castor oil befor bed every night. basically he uses all my stuff
3131 2018-11-18 17:50:18 CBD OIL?
3132 2018-11-18 17:50:12 The Labour Party has always been as much about free enterprise with a social condense not this socialist crap. It gets you nowhere and breeds corruption once it gets in power as it doesn’t have a counter argument to keep it in check. Just ask Venezuela the most oil rich nation
3133 2018-11-18 17:50:08 It makes a difference when you oil and have a routine. I’m ready for my hair to be out but the at the same time I’m not. Ok challenge accepted 
3134 2018-11-18 17:50:08 Protect the Mueller investigation, Confirm Rosenstein as the AG, and begin the process of where this all starts: Campaign Finance. As long as large contributions are allowed, politics will always follow that money. NRA, Koch Foundation, Oil, etc.
3135 2018-11-18 17:50:02 Only the hockey media can be this forgiving. The Oil essentially traded a quarterback for a safety who struggles in pass coverage; NFL media would annihilate them.
3136 2018-11-18 17:50:00 Maybe some un-popular opinions but.. I'd love to see Jar-Jar as a hero in 2019. He was a Bombad General after all 

Also, droids.R2-D2 would be popular; oil slick, rocket boosters, targeting system? HK-47 would be amazing or IG-88 if you want current. Either way, love the game!
3137 2018-11-18 17:49:59 Sorry Rob but you really annoyed me with your shot at the Oil Sands, ok it’s not anywhere near perfect but getting on the celebrity band wagon and taking a cheap shot at one of the safest and most ethical sources which attributes for a tiny amount of oil is just low.
3138 2018-11-18 17:49:56 Let the oil rich Nations help the suffering Faithfuls.
3139 2018-11-18 17:49:47 @SunKingBrewing where is the best spot to get your beer at Lucas Oil Stadium?
3140 2018-11-18 17:49:36 @BJP4India this was done and followed as we saw the pain in people, and also we follow closely oil prices. With a stop of 74 oil prices will reach 18 dollar in next 4 to 6 years. At 18 dollars do a longer term contract with oil companies for next, 10 years for lower fuel imports
3141 2018-11-18 17:49:36 Candles and/or oil lamps, dice, character sheets, pencils and... 'So you're in this tavern....'

3144 2018-11-18 17:49:26 It’s the people blocking aisle and complaining about how big the packages are that get me livid. It’s fucking Costco. If you don’t need 4L of olive oil at a time GTFO of my way because I do!!!!

3151 2018-11-18 17:48:54 Jerome Powell has more influence on crude oil prices than Trump   CC: @federalreserve
3152 2018-11-18 17:48:46 Unless the Fed prints a lot of $ before that and oil goes to $150.
3153 2018-11-18 17:48:37 Last night hot oil shot me in the eye and I’m thankful I can still see outta it

3157 2018-11-18 17:48:05 I want @RSPOtweets to vote to ensure palm oil companies adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #palmoil policies. I can’t bear to see our #rainforests & precious #orangutan habitat destroyed #RSPO #RT16
3158 2018-11-18 17:47:50 Off to pub left Alexa and Google home having a chat about the Fractional Distillation of Oil.
3159 2018-11-18 17:47:34 The oil change man likes to show me the dip stick and then make me pay 59 extra dollars. What can I do, he pointed at a stick.
3160 2018-11-18 17:47:33 Sorry but that is rubbish. 

There's nothing going on at #Brockham. See GGs latest drone footage. If tankers start rolling . I will video and tweet them . Hopefully in the new year :)
3161 2018-11-18 17:47:22 oui bien sûr un  malentendu quand la gendarmerie retrouve chez eux le gas oil ah mais c'est vrai c'était à l'insu de leur plein gré 
3162 2018-11-18 17:47:21 Trump is an ignorant & ridiculous person. Every day he is proofing this to the world. His „My-mastermind-knows-why-it-is-burning-in-California“ is so laughable. He is a cheap TV personality who made money in real estate. Nothing more. Snake oil salesman.
3163 2018-11-18 17:47:14 @EricTopol officially joined fake news contingent by equating EPA with fish oil, ignoring scientific evidence.  The authors of the editorial are clearly much more positive if one reads whole piece rather than the sentence singled out of context.  Shame!
3164 2018-11-18 17:47:12 the price of oil is so low no one wants to buy Canadian crude, it costs too much to extract and refine  both in terms of money and energy.  Even with proposed pipeline extension and a future increase in price it will always be that way.
3165 2018-11-18 17:47:11 It's so insane to even have to know that's a reality my country supports   Murder baby's for oil land pipelines
3166 2018-11-18 17:47:06 FUCK OIL it’s killing the god damn planet.
3167 2018-11-18 17:46:56 @thegoosemen Hey Tony! Can I get a Shots sandwich with yellow mustard and onions, a Momma Goosey Stuffa yo face- LTO, Banana Peppers, oil & vinegar- no cheese.
And 2 bowls of chili with cheese and onions. #sundayfavorites #yummy
3168 2018-11-18 17:46:48 As I stare an oil wheel comes
Sailing by, and I feel like
Growing fins and falling in
With the bricks, the bikes, the rusty tin
I'll swim along without a care
I'm eating sand when I need air
You can bet your life I'll meet a pike
Who'll wolf me down for tea tonight
3169 2018-11-18 17:46:46 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
3170 2018-11-18 17:46:41 Money paid by oil companies. Common public paying high petrol price.
3171 2018-11-18 17:46:41 It’s ironic isn’t it? 
The people who say they’re fighting to save the oil industry in Alberta are the same ones who helped destroy it. 
Too late.

3173 2018-11-18 17:46:22 My understanding of this concept of levels is that, since everything is already at rock bottom, the only movement is up! A very modest increment if anything! Also, considering the huge dollar inflows if the cude oil market remains stable!
3174 2018-11-18 17:46:21 Pls help me too...still looking to get my first supply,its Christmas already...supplier of oil + gas...LEGIT.
3175 2018-11-18 17:46:07 Bullshit propaganda - Big oil is not clean at all
3176 2018-11-18 17:46:04 But can you change oil on a car ;)
3177 2018-11-18 17:45:53 The oil aspect is hot. Two bimbos obviously out to collect a paycheck is a retchid turnoff.

3180 2018-11-18 17:45:15 That's a stretch, dragging Trudeau into an oil spill
3181 2018-11-18 17:45:10 Hey @RealJeffHoliday do you know if Argan oil does anything for rheumstoid arthritis?
3182 2018-11-18 17:44:57 I agree w/ all of that but that is completely irrelevant to my comment. What I said is presidents have very little control over oil prices. Trump wants oil prices much lower and has stated that himself. That's why I said they'd be $20 a barrel if he was actually controlling them.
3183 2018-11-18 17:44:34 @NongshimAmerica my chapagetti was missing the oil packed run me my live time pass to free chapagetti please
3184 2018-11-18 17:44:34 False. Plenty of oil and tight gas in WA.  Just poor infra to transport it efficiently.
3185 2018-11-18 17:44:24 Oil is really enabling me to paint however I want and finding out new techniques with it is such a delight. Also reading Alla Prima is giving me mindblowns at every page haha
3186 2018-11-18 17:44:17 Your hardly comparing changing an oil filter or ordering a meal to performing an abortion?
3187 2018-11-18 17:44:15 Coconut oil over Shea butter any day.
3188 2018-11-18 17:44:04 Chevron does still sell gasoline under their own name in Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. They own Shell, Texaco, and the Standard Oil name, though they only operate a handful of stations for trademark reasons.
3189 2018-11-18 17:43:42 I inject it day before. During the cook you just leave it in the oil 3 minutes per lbs.

3193 2018-11-18 17:43:00 Pipelines keep our economy pumping. They create jobs, safely transport oil and gas, and improve American energy security!

3195 2018-11-18 17:42:43 I saw a guy at this gym this morning rubbing baby oil on his arms like he was “Ravishing” Rick Rude. Dude, it’s 8 am on Sunday.
3196 2018-11-18 17:42:35 Oil and the ability to bring our (and the world's) economy to near collapse in a short amount of time.
3197 2018-11-18 17:42:29 /7 add in the fact that the LPC is killing oil & gas. The industry is losing $80M a day due to investment leaving and selling oil for $12/barrel. The carbon tax joke/cash grab. The virtue signaling adherence to gender equality and being an embarrassment on the world stage.

3200 2018-11-18 17:42:04 Agreed we can’t have oil racing out of the ground at $10/bbl, but won’t curtailing production play right into the hands of the foreign funded enviros goal of landlocking AB oil and keeping it in the ground?
3201 2018-11-18 17:42:03 Old French people (80+) stick to traditions. Unfortunately those younger than 60-70 fear fat and eat too many carbs + cook with vegetable oil. If this trend continues the French paradox will dissapear.
3202 2018-11-18 17:42:02 Don’t worry about oil price in India, make sure your govt will waste money on constructing statues and please you take care of foreign trip count.
3203 2018-11-18 17:41:55 ppl rly out here terrified of parabens, mineral oil, aluminum and other substances in their self care products that are largely INERT, and instead buying green beauty bs that use exogenous plant extracts and essential oils that are HORRIBLE for skin health
3204 2018-11-18 17:41:54 Suppression of green technology by big oil is well known. They are willing to murder to control their monopoly!
3205 2018-11-18 17:41:50 We can add some South American countries in the list I dare not travel... Also oil owners. That is a fascinating detail. Adds to their psychological profiles.
3206 2018-11-18 17:41:48 But it was clean Canadian oil, none of that dirty Saudi stuff. We have the cleanest oil. So clean you bath your children in it.
3207 2018-11-18 17:41:40 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
3208 2018-11-18 17:41:23 By today's standards, we were poor as church mice growing up. No TV, AC (deep South), very few clothes (but always clean), a clothes line instead of dryer, oil floor furnace, tiny house, etc. But since most people lived that way then, we were positively middle class. And HAPPY!
3209 2018-11-18 17:41:16 Try Native Child products. Their caster oil really works for me

London Labour Looted One Trillion from Scotland's Oil Revenue, and left us with Foodbanks and Poverty
3211 2018-11-18 17:41:09 After every shower I rub my WHOLE body with baby oil. That means I’m still wet; How the Fuck is my skin soo dry? Fuck Winter Where’s Summer? #WINTERvsSUMMER
3212 2018-11-18 17:41:08 Can't believe people are still calling XRP a security... desperate fools. XRP is the oil of finance now, only we know exactly how much is in the financial ground. $589 happens when banks buy it all up. Think about supply and demand ($280 Trillion in world wealth) #xrp

3215 2018-11-18 17:40:41 When Iran tried to nationalize their oil (because, know, they can handle it themselves) the CIA sent terrorists to overthrow the democratically elected leader and install a brutal monarch - the Shah.

That should be one obvious example.

3224 2018-11-18 17:39:41 PORT AUTHORITIES SHOULD PENALISE THE SHIP FOR MAKING OIL LEAKAGE.
3225 2018-11-18 17:39:33 but when you have blonde hair your hair turns into a brunette shade after 5 hours bc of the dirtiness and oil... people have literally asked me if my hair is wet or did i get out of the shower bc it’s that dark when i’m blonde lol

3241 2018-11-18 17:37:37 Cutting and burning dead trees and brush as biofuel instead of oil etc... Could reduce emissions and lower methane from rotting trees. This would appeal to Californian voters and reduce fires.

3243 2018-11-18 17:37:05 Scotland an Oil Rich Nation in debt. Debt being generated by Westminster. Now make a comparison with Norway. Less natural resources but is oil rich. It has £132Billion return on Oil fund. Scotland has nothing. Thank WM for balancing generations of U.K. budget with Scots oil 
3244 2018-11-18 17:36:59 Ok.... Can we have back the BILLIONS UK took in oil over 40+ years and still are?

3248 2018-11-18 17:36:46 Is there an up to date list of companies who only use sustainable palm oil? I keep finding conflicting info, but would like to avoid those companies who refuse to swap to sustainable. So hard to find right info...

3253 2018-11-18 17:36:27 Haha. This is true, but I’m curious if there are any strong points the veg/seed oil camp try to make and what are the responses to it?
3254 2018-11-18 17:36:20 Just getting to know that the PNG is shaping out to be the new game in town oil and gas wise in the next few years...hence flurry of attention from the big players makes sense..
3255 2018-11-18 17:36:17 Sure, it wasn't the fact that the trees planted there have oil in them that has been shown to be extremely flammable, the fact that neither brush nor dry and dead trees were cleared from the forest or the fact that people went there and made fire that caused those wildfires.

More oil means cheaper gas which is good for common folks & the economy. Of course, ethical questions remain but Khosoggi/Osama

3262 2018-11-18 17:35:25 You know the Dawn commercials where they wash the oil off the adorable ducks and otters and shit? Where do I apply??
3263 2018-11-18 17:35:13 If she's getting amazing results with rapeseed oil tell her to try walnut oil - omg that stuff is the vegan version of dripping (and Picassos are great spuds too). 
3264 2018-11-18 17:35:12 The EU is also in the process of banning unsustainable palm oil and closing tax loopholes, they’re also stopping selling arms to the Saudis.
3265 2018-11-18 17:35:10 Have you heard about this?
Money has been digitized, now the world will start benefiting from Digital Gold, Oil/Gas, Nix Coin through the Nixec Platform.

3267 2018-11-18 17:35:03 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3268 2018-11-18 17:35:01 The Saudi relationship is mainly about the petrodollar as Jimmy Dore points out. A lot of US foreign wars and belligerence are about maintaining high oil prices for the benefit of big oil corporations. Why is US trying to keep Iran and Venezuela oil off the market?
3269 2018-11-18 17:35:01 It does not matter who is in power in KSA, all must sell oil to support the Saudi economy. US’s only interest is a stable country exporting oil. MBS is becoming a liability.
3270 2018-11-18 17:34:58 It was a charger, body butter, baby oil, brush & comb lol I didn’t see no wipes or nothin
3271 2018-11-18 17:34:56 It’s that time of year when morning show cooking segments start defacing tamale recipes in the name of fusion & my kids are over here yelling at the screen like,
“NOBODY wants your avocado oil infused masa Susan that’s TRASH.”
3272 2018-11-18 17:34:51 I hear OPEC is upset at trump for the Iran deal. Can OPEC afford to cut enough oil output to hurt trump by driving oil price up?

3276 2018-11-18 17:34:30 It's not almost, fucking precise. He is an idiot, but he's cunning too, not like a fox cunning, like a snake oil salesman cunning, he can spot a bigger fool than himself a mile away.
3277 2018-11-18 17:34:27 Asked this guy to put olives in my salad bowl and he put olive oil instead. 
3278 2018-11-18 17:34:12 Why are fire seasons getting longer and fires more severe in grasslands and other nations? Why are extreme storms becoming more frequent? Why are glaciers, sea ice and tundra melting? Why did every nation sign Paris. Why does every major oil company website acknowledge it?

3289 2018-11-18 17:33:09 It was for dramatic effect. You'd be surprised what's bartered between us farmers. I've even been paid in dagga oil.

Well the share policy is for another debate. My point is that my money will buy me less bcos my skin is white. It's ludicrous in any other context, why not now?

i'm in a steadily growing college town in the desert of west Texas (not an oil economy like Midland).  the locals tell me it's a solid market.
3293 2018-11-18 17:32:30 Saying “Canadian oil is prevented from competing in the Canadian market AND is prevented from exporting via the east coast” 

Isn’t better. 

As for dairy - wow! A whole 4%! 

Which, again, is restricted by law....

3298 2018-11-18 17:31:38 Free to do as you wish, but if you're in the West, you're probably only hurting dairy cartel profiteers in the West.

I don't think the dairy lobby in QC cares about AB oil (not blocking) Only that LibCons protect them from US competition so they remain elites of agri-hierarchy.

If so that was the Big Oil investment.

3317 2018-11-18 17:29:49 Is it that you can't read or you don't comprehend when you do? Oil prices fell beyond the budget benchmark that led to low income from crude oil sales, for the past 2 and half years this admin has had oil prices higher than budget benchmark yet we borrowed 12 trillion in 3yrs.
3318 2018-11-18 17:29:47 Lmao when I used to eat bacon it had to be in the oven lol I know most people do put it in the oven cause it bakes the bacon to perfection without it looking weird like the oil does

3321 2018-11-18 17:29:18 It is outlandish how the energy sector is being treated by government inaction and by uni-issue environmentalists. BC has extreme objections to TransMountain while still taking transfer payments, and apparently thinking that shipping oil by train is safer than by pipeline.

3344 2018-11-17 23:58:50 Even if we stopped burning oil completely, we still need it for other things. And we still need to deliver it.

And if we own the pipeline, that means we get to charge oil companies for its use.

3389 2018-11-17 23:54:14 HAPPENED BEFORE. By comparison, and I know that this is 100% bias, but Walter flinching for Devlin for a split second is way more rewarding than the throwing away of a wedding ring. Also, I am well on the oil here 
3390 2018-11-17 23:54:11 Whose going to clean my back and rub the oil in when I get my back piece done
3391 2018-11-17 23:54:04 Happy to hear you are feeling good and well thanks to CBD oil!
3392 2018-11-17 23:54:02 How much are the oil companies paying you for that nugget? #corruptbloomburg
3393 2018-11-17 23:54:02 Just played: Dem A Sprinkle Oil - Assassin
3394 2018-11-17 23:53:45 cara pakai oil nya gimana ya bep:')
3395 2018-11-17 23:53:38 Exactly, and some media are glamorizing these cases too. They should get fined.
3396 2018-11-17 23:53:33 Trump's Bought and paid for by the oil royalty abroad and at home.
3397 2018-11-17 23:53:32 Disagree. His message resonated, deeply. He helped make the case that she was a pro-corp, oil & fracking loving centrist that wouldn't fight for the working class or the environment. He helped tip the DNC platform toward more progressive values. Voted 4 him in pri, not anti her.
3398 2018-11-17 23:53:09 Ahahahaha I have definitely almost killed myself multiple times doing shower and/or oil stuff 
3399 2018-11-17 23:52:58 Happy Founders Day to the young Bruhz with nasty oil and chicken that taste like smoke.
3400 2018-11-17 23:52:57 If you want to help orangutans, you will need to quit buying the following items from Tim Hortons as ALL of them contain palm oil: Cinnamon rolls, croissants, danishes, pastries, strudels, tea biscuits, and yes, all of the donuts and timbits.
3401 2018-11-17 23:52:42 "Mer, re: Christmas"

Meryl the executive secretary finds more than she bargained for when she is hired by a North Pole oil drilling firm who wants her to work through the holidays... that is, until Marty the office stenographer comes along!
3402 2018-11-17 23:52:06 I have officially become an essential oil junkie  #sorrynotsorry
3403 2018-11-17 23:51:35 @realDonaldTrump just wanted to say thank you for the low gas prices right now....because of the pressure you put on oil companies me and my family are saving at the pump every week....
3404 2018-11-17 23:51:09 I mean I agree, but if we put a diplomatic foot in their ass oil & gas prices will go up. Doesn't hurt the rich or middle class, but it lays a hurtin' on poor folks barely able to put gas in their car to get to work. The poor always feel the burden of the actions of the powerful.
3405 2018-11-17 23:51:07 The largest offshore oil spill in Newfoundland and Labrador history occurred in the offshore oil sector yesterday. 

Number of tweets about it from oil cheerleaders @PremierofNL @DwightBallMHA, his Natural Resources Min @SiobhanCoadyNL, Min @SeamusORegan, MHA @NickWhalenMP:

ZERO
3406 2018-11-17 23:50:53 They are running a stereotype campaign. Climate change isnt real. Two genders. Brexit. Media is lefty lies, Oil patch is great.  They've done the research and policy doesn't play. At least their policies don't
3407 2018-11-17 23:50:29 Snake oil salesman is all that he is Suzannah. So sad good honest people have been conned.
3408 2018-11-17 23:50:09 Started using carrot oil on my skin, let’s hope my shit GLOWSSSSS baby.
3409 2018-11-17 23:50:03 wrong Obama stripped funds from every branch of the military. Speaking about cowars. Obama drew a red line.  LMAO Obama no where to be found when Benghazi came down. BP oil disaster 30 days to Start to make a decision.  LMAO!  Dems 8 years of rule nothing but corruption, lies.
3410 2018-11-17 23:49:52 @realDonaldTrump heralds Saudi Arabia as “spectacular ally” 2 days after Govt levels sanctions for murdering an American journalist. Take note; our @POTUS considers American lives expendable in pursuit of oil and money.
3411 2018-11-17 23:49:25 Bes wala pako tulog Hahahahhaa. Pag punta mo dine bili ka ng oil pastel ha tsaka marker HAHAH
3412 2018-11-17 23:49:24 Def need a drizzle of olive oil tho 
3413 2018-11-17 23:49:16 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
3414 2018-11-17 23:49:04 There are some ear mite treatments that can be used on all animals in the house without issues.

One well known brand name is Dr Dogs Ear Oil. This is natural and it will eliminate [keyword] successfully and safely. It has no dangerous chemicals or pesticides and it has natural
3415 2018-11-17 23:48:57 CBD oil man ... my cousin takes it for Crohn's ..whole different person!!
3416 2018-11-17 23:48:48 Oil wealth stolen from the tribe? Imagine that 
3417 2018-11-17 23:48:47 Fw-toner-oil beb
3418 2018-11-17 23:48:45 What good things? Ruining our soul, air and water for the oil companies and other corporate polluters. What has he done so awesome? He wants to be a Dictator. He’s all for himself and his families financial gain, which is exactly what he is doing. Show me his Tax Returns.
3419 2018-11-17 23:48:41 Bernie is a person who believes in socialism. Oil rich countries like Norway and Saudi can run a welfare states until they run out of oil. Nokia and Motorola are not making money anymore.
3420 2018-11-17 23:48:37 This explosion has absolutely nothing to do with oil drilling or Prop 112. There's not a well anywhere near this area. You can debate oil and gas drilling all day long, but this horrific accident is not a part of it.
3421 2018-11-17 23:48:33 32% nat gas is a good start (but not leadership level, & “cleaner than coal” isn’t good enough)
Anti-EV’s due to dirty grid further flawed: we don’t stop using electrical appliances (in favor of oil powered versions) because 29% of grid is coal. Ever see an oil powered TV?
3422 2018-11-17 23:48:32 the vaunted, no-longer-so-covert US-Israel-Saud axis is the highest aspiration, the quintessence of Pence/Bolton/Pompeo foreign policy, an unshakable alliance of Evangelical, Zionist & Islamic religious fanaticism. But Trump is beginning to have doubts he just wants the cheap oil
3423 2018-11-17 23:48:26 Halley likes to take a nice long bath with lavender oil. The airship Longbow has a massive bathtub (their tallest crew member is 6'6"), so at 5' tall she can juuuust barely fully lie down in it.
3424 2018-11-17 23:48:16 Have you ever sailed along the St Lawrence River towards Montreal? Pretty magnificent scenery as well. Lots of oil tankers carrying oil from foreign countries to the port of Montreal. Doubt your tourism industry is any more valuable.
3425 2018-11-17 23:48:06 What are you doing Dougal to deserve such treatment? Baths are to #Westies what Oil is to water.... they dont mix Westies should only be bathed out of necessity Mine were bathed twice a year unless They did rolled in poo etc...
3426 2018-11-17 23:48:00 I don’t believe anyone on twitter knows how to at least change their oil in the slightest
3427 2018-11-17 23:47:47 Take a a cup of water, table spoon of cocoa powder, 10 drops of peppermint essential oil,  a splash of vanilla and simmer it on your stove, boom your house now smells like a peppermint mocha
3428 2018-11-17 23:47:30 YY can't hide the gf kinda pissed off at him adding oil to WYYY lol, also the beaming lasers at him w the sheet flirting.  Why would she get do ragey on own booboo exc a gf!?  This is all his silly plans to get some beating/handsy fr Y tho

Remember when you used to play piano
3432 2018-11-17 23:47:02 I did... I’m honestly at a loss for words with this one. Are we to believe he is this dim? Or are his ties with oil and coal so tight that he refuses to give in to our (the people’s) needs to a better future for the sake of money(that of which he has a sufficient amount)?

3433 2018-11-17 23:46:55 Callie closed the door behind her and Major sniffed at the android. 

“Major get down.” She scolded and gave him his food. She walked towards her work bench. 

“Workshops back there. Can you sit?” The android was spilling oil everywhere... ohwell she’d clean it up later.
3434 2018-11-17 23:46:31 Don't pretend that youre for the oil industry if you support trudeau and butts. This is misinformation.
3435 2018-11-17 23:46:28 Can you imagine if the Lobster industry was blocked/protested etc. as much as the western O and G industry? Think about what the fed gov is doing to the Oil Industry...
3436 2018-11-17 23:46:14 As @ninaandtito keeps telling us, "It's all connected."

Including Brexit. Including Saudi oil and business. Including human trafficking. All of it.

#itisallconnected
3437 2018-11-17 23:46:14 Andy, 1 thing that boggles my mind & something that could be started TODAY, instead of these damn oil pipelines, water pipelines. Every major city has a pipeline hooked up to their rivers, when a city is at risk of flooding, the line is opened & H20 is sent to cities that need it
3438 2018-11-17 23:46:13 This man got married, lost his job at an oil company and his wife helped secure another job somewhere even better. He traveled out. Today after 3 years, he’s planning to surprise his wife with a brand new Bentley. The joy in his voice notes >>>>>>
3439 2018-11-17 23:46:08 Syria? 

You mean the Country that has killed & made refugees of more of its own citizens that Israel ever did to the Palestinians? That Syria?

Drives you crazy that USA doesn't need Arab oil - doesn't it?  LL
3440 2018-11-17 23:46:03 I'm with you...makes no sense. I don't even like leaving my dog when I go to work, couldn't imagine leaving the little guy behind.
3441 2018-11-17 23:46:00 How do you prepare them? I like to cut them in half, drizzle with olive oil, season and roast them in the oven.
3442 2018-11-17 23:45:54 This sitch was some Moroccan Oil followed by Tresemme Volume and Lift Mousse 
3443 2018-11-17 23:45:50 Why is MSM and "CIA" blaming Saudi Arabia for #Khashoggi death?
*Crash the economy. SA will retaliate by raising oil prices
*Destabilize the Middle East. Israel still has a quasi-friendly relationship with SA. But they will turn on Israel as an extension of Western policy #MAGA
3444 2018-11-17 23:45:39 No. Not yet. I wasn't hungry before. I might see to getting us some bread and oil.
3445 2018-11-17 23:45:38 and definitely my natural gas bills are cheaper than any oil bill I paid.
3446 2018-11-17 23:45:27 Gold diggers keep digging till they hit oil
3447 2018-11-17 23:45:15 for sure the cobbled together former coal boiler that used a metal lunch tray in tacking on an oil burner at my 1 apt? No.
3448 2018-11-17 23:45:10 There is still a quantitative effect to oil companies and special interests hoarding patents and stifling advancements and either not offering or stopping (as we have) incentives to advance technology
3449 2018-11-17 23:45:07 Saudi royalty is disgusting man. Trash. Lucky they got the oil cuz they're horrible people. God  wont be kind
3450 2018-11-17 23:44:57 When your ass is so owned by the Saudis you always leave an oil slick in the toilet bowl.

3456 2018-11-17 23:43:35 Israel wants compensationS to pay by KSA for the Jews kicked from Madina during the time of Prophet pbuh 
Now you and your king Solomon have a lovely relationship with Israelis and your hearts won't work 
Israelis want 100 billion since you have A LOT OF OIL AND MONEY 
PAY NOW
3457 2018-11-17 23:43:24 To-Do List:

1. Oil change/rotate tires
2. Pickup dry cleaning
3. Check on grandma
4. Call dentist
5. Rake forest 

I forget one fucking thing...
3458 2018-11-17 23:43:17 I think, I can't possibly be shocked at  anything he says anymore. Then this....
He's an evil, lazy, thieving, sadistic, selfish, perverted, lying snake oil salesman.
3459 2018-11-17 23:43:13 He wants Siberia to defrost so he can build big hotels there and entertain Russian oil barons and assorted other scum
3460 2018-11-17 23:43:12 To be fair that's not all on Draisaitl. One could argue he's been Oilers best player over the last couple of wks & he's been moved to McDavid's line b/c goal scoring on 1st line has dried up unless it's coming from 97. This isn't the first time it's happened & likely not the last

3463 2018-11-17 23:43:00 The débâcle of racism playing out in Hawera is just exactly what you get when an oil industry that imports it’s senior staff from Texas, etc, into NZ, operates for thirty years without anyone calling out their bigotry.
Locals absorb the racism along with the business contracts.
3464 2018-11-17 23:42:54 When you wash your hair add some  baking soda to you shampoo, condition massage your scalp add heat you can also every 2 weeks add some  peppermint oil to your conditioners let it sit in your hair for about 15 minutes rinse in cool water.
3465 2018-11-17 23:42:50 And without control of Scotland's oil would not be able to borrow enough to cover deficit.
3466 2018-11-17 23:42:42 The trick is to water your employees with a mixture of peanut oil and holy water
3467 2018-11-17 23:42:38 Even though the saudis gouge us in oil and what about the saudi terrorists who killed over 3,000 and counting on September 11th??
3468 2018-11-17 23:42:36 I just got the oil machine, I got the lemon on.

3474 2018-11-17 23:41:31 it's pretty much gendered at this point because god forbid we just sell one thing to both men and women, lol. I've never tried baby wipes, but these have degreasers in them so they help break down oil, which is awesome.
3475 2018-11-17 23:41:25 How much revenue would federal government lose if all those oil patch workers weren’t making money and paying income tax and were stuck on EI or welfare?
3476 2018-11-17 23:41:14 microwave instructions: cook for 30 seconds then flip over and cook for 20 more seconds

3484 2018-11-17 23:40:24 I know but at least people are being made aware. Dirty palm oil is a major cause of deforestation and orangutans pushing to extinction.  Our closest relative.  Alot of people still feel that you can't trust that sustainable oil is sustainable as hard to trace back. Some mixed.
3485 2018-11-17 23:40:14 Maybe we can store the oil until everyone runs out and be awash in $$.

3489 2018-11-17 23:39:33 How often have you seen someone raving about CBD oil that doesn't have a link for you to buy it? Lol, it might be great though idk haven't tried it before
3490 2018-11-17 23:39:32 True. But, on the bright side, the fallout shows that, despite their oil and despite their owning a lot of US debt, the Saudis are not invulnerable.

3496 2018-11-17 23:39:07 GS were also confidently predicting oil back above 80 after it traded down to 75 so if clients didn't blow up their accounts on that advice hopefully this one will have a better result!

3498 2018-11-17 23:38:53 @ToyotaCanada received the worst customer service at Scarborough Toyota on Saturday.  Went in for an oil change and winter tire swap and spent over 4 hours waiting.  This is the second time this has happened.  Love my Venda and Sienna but hate Scarborough Toyota.
3499 2018-11-17 23:38:44 Vegetable oil. None available? Make some.

3503 2018-11-17 23:37:47 No. Global factors that are pushing down oil prices. Makes some people happy. Some sad.
3504 2018-11-17 23:37:46 1. WHAT in the studies? Show working
2. Big Oil acknowledges AGW narrative - hardly surprising since it is owned - like "big" everything - by the plutocrats who push Warmism
3505 2018-11-17 23:37:45 What is the name of the oil or what are you using for fisting
3506 2018-11-17 23:37:37 New in stock!! Diffusers and oil! The aromas are sure to please!! These make GREAT gifts for friends and loved ones this holiday season! Or just get one for yourself!

3508 2018-11-17 23:37:20 May give u good health my dear; PMB will build a good hospital that I am sure... but that does not deprive him of listening to his doctor when d needs, wil sold oil for $145 today is $50 with ECA emptied & reserve depleted. there is no more free money pple just don't want d truth
3509 2018-11-17 23:37:20 And OBTW, I worked in Oklahoma, post oil they are not a wealthy state, they would love people to invest there, but generally, even Americans think twice about it!
3510 2018-11-17 23:37:15 I’m actually crying in bed because Oil is my ultimate fear food so I can’t eat the nice dinner my mother made hahahahaha I wanna die
3511 2018-11-17 23:36:54 The problem became apparent when the ATA started using teacher dues to declare war on industries their students parents are employed in like Pipelines, oil and gas exploration etc. Deteriorating results coupled with an  extremist activist mentality = time for change.

3516 2018-11-17 23:35:41 So do I. Mine forces me to check those things for her, and when I’m not around, she does it herself. She went on her own, just yesterday, to have her oil changed. So why are you generalizing the fact that your mum fails to do that to all women/ladies?

3518 2018-11-17 23:35:25 They question his motives and rightly so. Trump does not seem to do anything that doesn’t benefit him or his cronies, ex: big lumber, oil & uranium, coal interests...
3519 2018-11-17 23:35:21 Olive oil, salt, pepper, coals, lime....
3520 2018-11-17 23:35:18 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
3521 2018-11-17 23:35:15 Its disgusting that OUR soldiers are fighting an holy war in disguise of oil, terrorism, false recon etc...pls go read on the holy crusade war b4 u @ me...free country free people...
3522 2018-11-17 23:35:12 Trudeau has stonewalled all efforts to make Canada self sufficient with respect to oil. Even Obama made sure the USA became self sufficient. Even Trumps efforts to finish the XL pipeline have been frustrated. The  new Michigan Government wants to throw a wrench into an expansion
3523 2018-11-17 23:35:11 Oil for convulsion? I won't be surprised if it's Coconut oil, the only thing remaining for the oil na to raise people from the dead 
Have you ever asked them what happens after the oil application?
3524 2018-11-17 23:34:50 There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq & they could have taken Saddam Hussein without any violence but from 20.3.2003 to 18.12.2011 Over 600 thousand innocent Iraq people were slaughtered to death & Iraq was blown to peace’s & the Jews wanted the oil that’s why.
3525 2018-11-17 23:34:16 "elbow room" to increase C-emissions by continuing/expanding infrastructure for burning fossil gas, expanding airport/aviation/C-emissions, extracting oil & gas, #fracking etc no doubt, and "slowing progress" in insulating homes, onshore wind, solar - knowing CP and the Tory govt
3526 2018-11-17 23:34:10 If we truly cared about foreign journalistic freedom and extrajudicial killings, we would not be buying Chinese products. Why is oil any different? @ScottAdamsSays
3527 2018-11-17 23:34:06 ketchup packets but filled with truffle oil
3528 2018-11-17 23:33:40 Decatur vs New Pal next Saturday at 7:05 at Lucas Oil Stadium. Tickets are $15. All alumni’s come out and support
3529 2018-11-17 23:33:34 I love Amazon . Like really love it !! I needed a part for my car . $157.00 for a oil timing switch. Went to amazon that bitch was $38.50 . Let’s all thank God for Amazon!!
3530 2018-11-17 23:33:25 Baby skin wajib double cleanser. Itu nutupi pori"mu banget. Kalo perlu triple cleanser (oil,water,fw)
3531 2018-11-17 23:33:24 person: “hey girlie! With just a single drop of this lemon grass earth dirt tree nature outdoor voodoo rosemary  essential oil literally ALL your problems will go away!!!” 

me: sounds suspect but okay
3532 2018-11-17 23:32:44 Oil stelan 
Rp 210.000
3533 2018-11-17 23:32:30 Baby oil Canon's would prevent that!
3534 2018-11-17 23:32:26 Oh is the oil businesses back?
3535 2018-11-17 23:31:59 I am a capitalist and I think capitalism is part of the solution to climate change.

But the science is pretty clear, we are heading towards human extinction within a decade or two. Want real free market capitalism? Stop subsidizing oil companies.
3536 2018-11-17 23:31:54 Question: did you use any oil?
3537 2018-11-17 23:31:50 Just a valley of blood and the desiccated corpses of oil tycoons and billionaires and captain planet sweaty and panting as he cuts the throat of a Koch brother.
3538 2018-11-17 23:31:34 Put Hot water in a bucket. Put some Robb or Aboniki or SilverBird Oil. Cover your head with a towel with your  head over the water. Take some oranges or conf Vitamin C.
3539 2018-11-17 23:31:25 Revelvant really, when you lose the Barnett Formula.  Do you know how cheap US oil can be got out the ground with fracking?  Dirt cheap.  Times change you know, this is not the 1950's any more, it's moved on.
3540 2018-11-17 23:31:19 You are not media. You are snake oil salesmen. @TrambleJoe  is the biggest one out there.
3541 2018-11-17 23:31:16 Butterscotch candies and CBD oil, a classic combination 
3542 2018-11-17 23:31:13 This the time of year that I mix oil in my lotion smh
3543 2018-11-17 23:30:49 @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats @FrankPallone I don't want this oil company shill anywhere near the decision making process about our energy future.
3544 2018-11-17 23:30:49 Lmao nah nah ima get my oil changed
3545 2018-11-17 23:30:48 I avoid palm oil because I have never seen that logo on anything in the UK
3546 2018-11-17 23:30:43 You know how sometimes when you're at the grocery store and you can't remember if you already have something so you buy it again? Yeah... THAT'S why I have 2 gallons of olive oil. Probably.
3547 2018-11-17 23:30:32 We ran out of oil for the boiler, and I just shrugged, thought “it’s not as cold as it was when the fire burned out at the yurt” and threw the biggest comforter on the bed.
3548 2018-11-17 23:30:12 If you don’t create some friction to remove the highs and lows in the crosshatch your engine will use oil forever.
3549 2018-11-17 23:30:09 I love using peppermint oil, it works really good for headaches.
3550 2018-11-17 23:30:06 I lived in Texas and a perfect State it is not. Tons of migrants and tons of rich oil ppl trying to keep us addicted to oil.
3551 2018-11-17 23:30:05 I assume @CBCNL will cover the oil spill in the offshore oil field with the same vigor and attention they spend on all those big happy oil sector stories right?
3552 2018-11-17 23:29:54 I’m a cosplayer! I love to create. I love photography & art. Oil paintings are my favorite.
3553 2018-11-17 23:29:50 Kirbie, CBD oil can help with seizures. I can give you some dog biscuits with CBD from our company, The Leafy Dog. Just tell me where to send them!
3554 2018-11-17 23:29:47 @oilersyyc listening to the podcast. Thanks for bringing up stars oilers 97-03. Lots of good memories, and lots of heartbreak. 2000, oil could have won. ‘Member when oilers lost 3 straight OT’s including double and Triple time
3555 2018-11-17 23:29:37 Tea tree oil saved my life wallah
3556 2018-11-17 23:29:04 i get off work to stay another hour just to get my oil changed... should’ve never clocked out
3557 2018-11-17 23:29:01 $3.2 Billion in annual subsidies to the oil industry in Canada  Billions for a dirty, old pipeline and billions more for a new one.  When will the oil industry pay it's own way without government handouts?
3558 2018-11-17 23:28:25 Out here pouring oil, engine coolant and windshield wiper fluid into my car all at the same time feeling like a damn mechanic
3559 2018-11-17 23:28:24 It is true that palm oil is versetile and therefore takes less land But the deforestation is happening in specific areas that are devastated and sustainable palm oil is the only way to go. Greenpeace film is spot on. Iceland ad has opened the debate.
3560 2018-11-17 23:28:20 *on the phone with my dad*
Me: Okay I'll talk to you later, love you!

Him: 
Don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say it
Don't say it

"Ok, remember to go and get your oil changed"
3561 2018-11-17 23:28:05 The studies. The only scientists that disagree are the ones that either a) also disagreed that cigarettes cause cancer or b) are funded by big oil groups. There's nothing to suggest they're lying. They may be incorrect but I have no expertise is the field to prove it.
3562 2018-11-17 23:27:46 Did you know that we sell our famous Chili oil to go? Stop by today to grab a jar! 
3563 2018-11-17 23:27:46 Oh yeah, they had it televised here finally. Still wish the Oil took Kooy over Rodrigue. Or drafted them both.
3564 2018-11-17 23:27:43 In response to the oil spill off Newfoundland the Government of Canada pledges fifty more speeches about how new offshore oil sector environmental assessments will be faster and provide certainty for the industry.
3565 2018-11-17 23:27:43 3rdの白パーカー欲しいんだよな
3566 2018-11-17 23:27:40 I'm not the baker, so I can't comment on the pies, but the anchovies dissolve into the oil (with garlic) that the chard is sauteed in, so it's really just greens (and stalks, that's the real key to this one) with extra umami.
3567 2018-11-17 23:27:32 Because oil has fallen internationally 26 cents per barrel. We will eventually see about a 5 cent drop in prices because of Ford.... But considering the damage it's going to cost us as a society. Doubling of homeless, shuttering hospitals, destruction of our social safety nets
3568 2018-11-17 23:27:19 Mr Butts. I can speak for Alberta and what Trudeau has done to the Oil and Gas industry. He is the enemy!!
3569 2018-11-17 23:27:08 It’s not tho, lmao I don’t use oil
3570 2018-11-17 23:27:04 They just don't want to appear weak when no action is taken .A Middle East allie with oil.
3571 2018-11-17 23:26:56 ok now do your sacrament with the olive oil .....
3572 2018-11-17 23:26:54 よっしゃ！！勝ってる！！
3573 2018-11-17 23:26:52 I slept in, made breakfast & coffee for the fam, deep conditioned my hair and used a new face mask with cottonseed oil and I'm... living. Should I get my nails done to complete this self care Saturday ORWHAT
3574 2018-11-17 23:26:20 You know damn well you watched too many horror movies in ya life to be showering with the lights off, that's a white people remedy massage your scalp with diluted peppermint oil and go to sleep 
3575 2018-11-17 23:26:12 Lots of "ifs"  there. And if you look at all of those jurisdictions, all of them have very real economic and social problems also. And do you think that even if it were to happen, (which it won't) it would somehow build more pipeline or sell one more barrel of oil?
3576 2018-11-17 23:26:03 Oh definitely, but it still doesn't get folks off oil and natural gas.

Or get the MBTA off natural gas for buses.
3577 2018-11-17 23:26:00 Mad thieves everywhere they will jump into frying oil one day
3578 2018-11-17 23:25:45 Tonerrr!!! Helps with oil, inflammation, and acne. Make sure you moisturize along with it because the witch hazel will actually help hold in more moisture. I like the witch hazel with rose in it .
3579 2018-11-17 23:25:33 WID ITリミックス、OLIVE OILさんが現場でかけてると聞いてぶち上がりでまだ落ち着かない笑
3580 2018-11-17 23:25:28 ไม่เห็นวะ
3581 2018-11-17 23:25:19 Most non-animal product are oil by products.
I'm fed up with oil by products.
Creeps profit.  
It doesn't hurt a sheep to get sneered.  They like it.
Unfortunately, animals are needed.
Treat them humanely, honour their sacrifice.
Don't kill people.
3582 2018-11-17 23:25:16 You know what I was hearing today? A recorded message played on loud speaker. Rub this oil, it cures convulsion. No wonder children always have that oil scent when they are brought on account of convulsion
3583 2018-11-17 23:25:15 I actually think Pellegrini is starting to get them into shape. With a bit more consistency they could become a good mid table team. Unless we're bought by Arab oil we're not going to be anything else
3584 2018-11-17 23:24:36 US pumping all it has out before the electronic revolution takes over 5-6 decades from now - oil prices - get em while their hot
3585 2018-11-17 23:24:35 He needs there oil
3586 2018-11-17 23:24:32 New Governor, conservative Legislature, willing oil companies.  What is not to like.
3587 2018-11-17 23:24:30 At LEAST He showed Up? Obama with that BP Oil Spill(Three WEEKS) or Disasters?
3588 2018-11-17 23:24:23 lol probably? i just use the squalane oil i use on my face
3589 2018-11-17 23:24:13 @detroitcandles i visited last Monday for a financial blessing and received some oil and 2 scriptures to read: am i supposed to recite the scriptures along with using the oil 3x/day?
3590 2018-11-17 23:23:55 The promoter shouldnt look in the mirror the trainer needs to retire.  This is like a oil change place smiling in your face and giving bough oil lol
3591 2018-11-17 23:23:51 I cannot wait to get home from work tomorrow night and have a shower, I’m covered in engine oil and soot and smell like coal fire smoke but it was sooo much funnnnn
3592 2018-11-17 23:23:33 I hear oil in the North Sea isn't doing so well lately?  Too costly to get out, resources running out, world prices fallen, US now fracking oodles of oil and gas at very low prices.  Good luck then.
3593 2018-11-17 23:23:26 Excessive oil use.  We thought it was bs, but by the time they got ours in shop one was using quite a bit.  Maybe they changed from forged to steel pistons, or. Vice versa???  Undersized and rings didn’t hold up.
3594 2018-11-17 23:23:20 *We climb out of the water and I rub coconut oil on her back and go into get her an ice cold ice tea* "Anything else I can get to make you comfortable?"
3595 2018-11-17 23:23:11 Of course not - they are in the pocket of the oil and gas industry.
3596 2018-11-17 23:23:00 I ride my horse from the oil rig to NASA to go to school
3597 2018-11-17 23:22:56 Mentioning about Christmas, Hanukkah is coming up as well December 2-10. It's a Jewish Festival of Lights remembering the miracle during the Maccabees time... celebrated among other things with lighting a candle each of the eight days, and eating foods cooked in oil. +Dreidel
3598 2018-11-17 23:22:53 BRITTLE NAILS:
If your hand are always cold, your nails will become hard and brittle.
Soft nail tips:
✽Rub ANY kind of oil into your fingers
✽Give yourself a manicure
✽Trim your nails
✽Trim hangnails/buff cuticles
✽Moisturize!
3599 2018-11-17 23:22:45 As I said, I support investing to decarbonize our economy. Climate change will be as devastating economically as it will be environmentally. We can't afford to keep buying or selling oil.

The transition won't end there, but it has to begin with no more pipelines. Not one.
3600 2018-11-17 23:22:31 I am a memeologist. I taught memeology and memetics for 30 years. I've lived and memed globally. 

Economist brother in law thinks GERS and WM is factual and doesn't know about secret oil fields. He's seen economic reports or something equally silly.

3603 2018-11-17 23:22:15 From my little experience growing up in another oil producing Nation it’s so easy to engage d youth, frm as little at d primary school, hw attractive is our schooling systems?if we completely deregulated oil, instead allow market to determine d cost, we only issue & seize liences

3605 2018-11-17 23:21:55 Why are universities owned by the upper class does not go around murdering people and stealing their oil!
3606 2018-11-17 23:21:50 Stating the obvious: It involves building infrastructure to export LNG and oil to Asia so they can displace coal and other more CO2 intensive sources of supply. We in turn can use the CO2 taxes and economic benefits to transition our economy to more renewables.
3607 2018-11-17 23:21:41 i was gonna make brownies but we don't have enough oil and i don't think the campus shop sells it :(
3608 2018-11-17 23:21:41 Along with Christmas, Hanukkah is coming up as well December 2-10. It's a Jewish Festival of Lights remembering the miracle during the Maccabees time... celebrated among other things with lighting a candle each of the eight days, and eating foods cooked in oil (Latkes). +Dreidel
3609 2018-11-17 23:21:30 coconut oil fixed my lips and cleansed my soul
3610 2018-11-17 23:21:28 What about unlocking US energy potential and becoming top oil producer? Rolling back burdensome financial regs? Burdensome regulations in general? Crushing ISIS? Moving North Korea towards disarmament? Ross, Assange, Flynn are just individuals.
3611 2018-11-17 23:21:20 put oil in it

3614 2018-11-17 23:21:00 No, Trudeau has given billions to Bombardier, and caused Energy East to be shut down for the carbon that Bombardier planes were going to burn. It's logic like this we want Trudeau gone. Canadian oil is ethical, can't say the same for Saudi oil, as they murder their citizens.
3615 2018-11-17 23:20:57 I use the oil free one and I use a it on a q tip for like stubborn eye liner and mascara.
3616 2018-11-17 23:20:45 ka palit nakag oil control bayot? hahahaha
3617 2018-11-17 23:20:33 I'm blocked by Graham Linehan, for implying he's no oil painting.
3618 2018-11-17 23:20:32 “Chinese President Xi Jinping, shares many things in common with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.”  Right. Both Xi and Du30 want China to own and control the SCS? They both want China to mine the oil, gas and rich minerals off Palawan? They both want to bury Phl in debt?
3619 2018-11-17 23:20:25 Changed the oil in my car and made sure my suspension is good. Gotta love the lingering smell of oil on my hands
3620 2018-11-17 23:20:24 Venezuela is a country that experienced both things: a low IQ country that first got rich through oil and then got poor through socialism
3621 2018-11-17 23:20:17 Once I learn how to change my oil, replace my windshield wipers, and install a new battery, it’s OVER for you Jiffy Lube
3622 2018-11-17 23:19:54 Because it's false. 
This is the propaganda being peddled by American Soya oil producers using their considerable wealth and media reach to give their closest competitor a bad name. And the likes of @IcelandFoods are either complicit in the scam or are useful idiots.
3623 2018-11-17 23:19:49 LOLOLOL too funny snake oil man #Trump2020
3624 2018-11-17 23:19:43 You can reapply to the EU. You can’t reverse state theft of assets from people.  Renationalisation.  Appropriation of assets and land. Venezuela will take generations to put right and they have oil to make it easier.
3625 2018-11-17 23:19:39 That's awesome! I never really appreciated culture when I was little as I was surrounded by it. I remember asking my grandma once if there would be any of Chief White Eagle's oil money left by the time it came to me

I remember this still as she pinched and whipped me pretty good
3626 2018-11-17 23:19:22 His forearm (see page 30). Fascinating snippet of information.

Interesting also that it led to an increased use of acrylic paint. 

If this is the case I'd guess he used acrylic for the flat areas of colour (on unprimed canvas they'd also act as primer) and oil for figures.

3629 2018-11-17 23:19:00  my heart is seriously breaking ! We had people tell us that the reason our city burned so bad was because of the oil sands and this was our karma  No actually we had very warm spring and all our snow melted by mid April and we got no rain
3630 2018-11-17 23:18:52 Snake oil? Really? Things that give insight, help people consider who they are&how they react? Surely a 'is it helpful, judge it by the fruits' approach'. Enneagram  doesn't present itself as an empirical 'diagnostic' tool, nor do most of those those type of tools.
3631 2018-11-17 23:18:49 Have you tried castor oil?

✽ Use hair masks

3641 2018-11-17 23:17:27 Get the Hell-Fuck off my feed.

I support Renewable Energy. Climate Change will be our doom, and we are doing next to nothing about it.

Why are we forced to continue to use last century's technology, when Wind, Solar are the Future?

Why are they forced out of business by Oil?!
3642 2018-11-17 23:17:25 Some of your tweets of the day leave me perplexed; you either were welcome with a beverage tinted with CBD oil in California or Melania had it and is now slipping a pill in your morning coffee... keep going we certainly appreciate the lamb side of @realDonaldTrump.

3644 2018-11-17 23:16:56 CG2014, Have you looked at ways to short the Canadian (mainly Vancouver and Toronto) housing bubble yet?

With WCS oil prices off a cliff, and a housing correction/crash underway, slim chance the economy avoids a recession within a few Q, as BOC can't really cut into FED strength
3645 2018-11-17 23:16:53 nothing is asking to be shoplifted more easily than essential oil blends

3654 2018-11-17 23:16:16 Honestly, I think we need to cut ties with all ME countries except for Israel and maybe Jordan. Most of these countries don’t accept other religions and even persecute them. We also need to cut ties with our reliance on oil and focus on advanced technology to replace it.

3657 2018-11-17 23:15:52 You and I are like oil and water and we've been trying to mix it up. #NP @IncubusBand
3658 2018-11-17 23:15:46 Blend 3 pints broccoli with 4 1/2 tbsps cheese. Add Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve a la mode
3659 2018-11-17 23:15:42 Actually its worse than that - the oil becomes vapour in hot weather/fires, ie flammable gas in the air itself.
3660 2018-11-17 23:15:35 I'm aware what the oil price is. I'm not disputing that. I'm disputing the victim narrative of the industry that is producing at record high levels and making billions in profit.
3661 2018-11-17 23:15:26 With him, everything boils down to money and sex. If you look into most of his connections, you will see that his "policies"  are dictated by how much money his cronies can make from his decisions, i.e. the environment, the oil industry, immigration. Explain your Obama claim.
3662 2018-11-17 23:15:05 All of the above! What oil do you use other than olive?
3663 2018-11-17 23:15:04 turns out the oil that builds up in your #plenty is pretty damn potent #420
3664 2018-11-17 23:14:54 They're heroes working to prevent vile snake oil brexiters from betraying UK & its people with lies & delusions
3665 2018-11-17 23:14:48 Baby oil takes hard to get matte lipsticks right off your lips.
3666 2018-11-17 23:14:48 No it’s because they are a check on Iran. We produce more oil than them at this point since fracking.
3667 2018-11-17 23:14:45 Well done Andrew. You are standing up for Lancaster House Brexit and not the #FakeBrexit we are being sold by snake oil sales May.
3668 2018-11-17 23:14:40 Take it off, yeah!
Wave your panties in the air, lick your lips and shake your hair, uh huh
Ooh, when you spread a little oil, yeah, my blood begins to boil, uh huh
Yeah, it's so hard to choose, when you all look so fine
3669 2018-11-17 23:14:34 "The grooviest and whitest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3670 2018-11-17 23:14:33 2 Reishi caps at bedtime with warmed organic 3% milk after Yoga then a bath. Plus Calcium and Magnesium. Plus a dram (old-school...way 'witchy') of extra virgin olive oil on a warmed whole foods dinner plus pleasant and intellectually stimulating dinner conversation.
3671 2018-11-17 23:14:31 Only Irving oil imports from the Saudis. Go after them by name or STFU.
3672 2018-11-17 23:14:31 You can (barely) see it in the background of the scene in which C-3PO takes an oil bath.
3673 2018-11-17 23:14:16 I’ve changed my own oil before 
3674 2018-11-17 23:14:13 I got Jamaican black castor oil on my ergonomic mouse 
3675 2018-11-17 23:14:01 ONION OIL
3676 2018-11-17 23:13:54 Yes. The oil is natural fuel.
3677 2018-11-17 23:13:49 Mine isn’t 100% clear yet and obviously I still have acne scars but girl get some 100% argan oil. My acne is like 99% gone now and my acne scars are starting to fade.
3678 2018-11-17 23:13:43 The price of a barrel of Candian crude fell to $13 this week while Texas oil was at $50 a barrell. They were saying it was an emergency and had an analyst on saying that it was bc Canada needs more pipelines and also needs to stop overproduction.
3679 2018-11-17 23:13:37 Getting a $50+ oil change hurts my chest. Does my car REALLY need oil?
3680 2018-11-17 23:13:11 Oil prices is low globally and this has nothing to do with Ford !
3681 2018-11-17 23:13:01 That's honestly something really cool. It's a shame that 19 is now an oil burner.
3682 2018-11-17 23:12:53 Not the oil spill!  sis literally can’t hang NO WHERE!
3683 2018-11-17 23:12:52 You mean oil. Just say oil.
3684 2018-11-17 23:12:41 Wow, what a bunch of crazy BS. Fossil fuel use is increasing planet wide. The main reason Canadian oil is targeted is because other countries say f you to anyone protesting!
3685 2018-11-17 23:12:38 Yes thank you I’m a firm believer of CBD oil I ran out of it a few months ago want to find more that’s affordable. It was 100mg
3686 2018-11-17 23:12:24 GIRL DID ME THE SAME WAY AT A OIL SPILL AT WKU  I was like I’m finna DROP YOU OFFFFFF
3687 2018-11-17 23:12:22 (Saudi invested in Russian arctic LNG & other projects, boosted trade and other partnerships in past 3 weeks)
4- Saudi no longer committed to replacing iranian oil output, planning cuts
5- paralyzed Trump's middle East strategy
6- big win for Qatar, Iran and Turkey as well
3688 2018-11-17 23:12:10 Something I think about is all the houses in the US Northeast that still use oil for heat and hot water
3689 2018-11-17 23:12:00 Like you guys wouldn't kill for all that oil & gas. Smh.
3690 2018-11-17 23:11:47 @IcelandFoods sorry that the advert regarding palm oil got banned. But did you know your stores sell yogurt covered cranberries that contain palm oil.
3691 2018-11-17 23:11:46 the lady responded saying “i did massage already”... my friend says “no u didn’t.. u just rubbed oil”....
3692 2018-11-17 23:11:42 Life is good things live care yourself use olive oil and loook sky how is blue like ocean

3694 2018-11-17 23:11:33 @RachelNotley This Means The Supply Production And Demand For Oil Will Fluctuate. Not The Price. This Is Advanced Future Controls Economics.
3695 2018-11-17 23:11:24 Awesome! We are so happy you have found relief through CBD oil. 
3696 2018-11-17 23:11:23 bath? oil? and incense? you say? 
yassssss queen witch
3697 2018-11-17 23:11:17 $$$$$$$ is the business. And it is being minded. 
Arms deals. Oil deals. Hotel deals
3698 2018-11-17 23:11:17 Big oil companies ripping off Canadians in BC with prices higher than anywhere in Canada! East using importer gas have much lower prices! Perhaps BC should use Saudi gas, like Quebec and Ontario?
3699 2018-11-17 23:11:16 Relax. The country / province  doesn’t need the royalties, jobs, taxes both direct and indirect, and investment capital a vibrant oil industry provides. 

That stuff just sort of “balances itself out”.  


3700 2018-11-17 23:11:08 welp there goes all my money on new tires & an oil change :)
3701 2018-11-17 23:10:49 wonder if we could get an update on the state of north sea oil from experienced and tory  expert Ian Wood fae Aberdeen, @RossThomson4PM perhaps could interview him
3702 2018-11-17 23:10:48 ワワワのとき阿呆みたいに叫んでた
3703 2018-11-17 23:10:47 The kind of deception APC is allowed to spread. They’ll scream Buhari has no oil block. Does GEJ or OBJ have oil block?

Only the uninformed would not know that such acquisitions are channeled through proxies and Buhari as king of cronyism uses his family and friends as fronts!
3704 2018-11-17 23:10:36 Having given further thought to whether I dress for myself, for women, for other genders... I DRESS LIKE I LIVE IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA AND OIL HEAT IS EXPENSIVE. It’s 64F in my house. I’m layering weird stuff. That’s just how it is.

3710 2018-11-17 23:10:02 @RachelNotley Rachel. Put Into Law A Base Low Price For Unrefined Heavy Crude From Alberta Oil Sands. Price Of A Barrel. Should Be Static.
3711 2018-11-17 23:09:57 We make a lot of things with the chillies we grow, including hot sauce. Never made chilli oil. I will fix that next year!
3712 2018-11-17 23:09:45 Ultimate Tin Man with Axe & clock heart . Oil can would be  lol, and the wicked which with burning broom 
3713 2018-11-17 23:09:28 Sorry, but you can't describe something as "cruelty-free" when it's not even vegan. Then there's the palm oil aspect as well. @peta should not have given you a cruelty-free certification.
3714 2018-11-17 23:09:04 That's up for debate.  But each individual creates a significant amount of waste daily multiply that by 7.5 billion and you get the cess pools that we have in my state.  Take for example everyday over 100 million barrels of oil are consumed
3715 2018-11-17 23:09:04 Anyone know anywhere I can get reasonably priced palm oil free mascara?
3716 2018-11-17 23:08:52 im really trying with reducing the number of products i buy that have palm oil but srsly wtf so many products have palm oil in its mad
3717 2018-11-17 23:08:42 Humans dont desire war. They dont want to be forced to fight & die for a cause they know nothing about, which 99% of the time solely benefit the leaders causing the war.

Every single war created was solely for the sake of obtaining money, oil, or land. 

Nothing else.
3718 2018-11-17 23:08:42 And used as firewood to make up for the gas/oil shortages.
3719 2018-11-17 23:08:39 Oil change done. Who wanna fill my tank up though regular gas?
3720 2018-11-17 23:08:33 Instead of castigating @atiku for this noble and laudable policy statement, we should rather focus on demanding an explanation of HOW from him. The best thing that can ever happen to the Nigerian oil sector is the total unbundling of the NNPC. Let it be listed in the stock market
3721 2018-11-17 23:08:19 DC pleaded with Scotland: 'Lead us, don't leave us'. Scotland voted 62% to stay in EU. Westminster response? Fuck you Scotland.  Scottish oil was about to run out before Independance ref, it's now keeping the UK afloat post EU exit apparently. Aye fine Tessa
3722 2018-11-17 23:08:13 Yes! I love their stuff but you’re right it’s $$$. I went away from their hair oil to try a different brand and while it’s good I’m going back when I’m out.
3723 2018-11-17 23:08:13 The Earth is flat the moon landing was faked evolution is a lie Obama did 9/11 we have plenty of oil clean coal solar panels steal all the sun's energy vaccines cause autism 

Is that stupid enough?
3724 2018-11-17 23:08:02 Agreed. I like very much your olive oil (dieta mediterranea) vs. butter people / cultures distinction. Also sort of marking the difference between ‘people who shout’ vs ‘people who whisper’ :)
3725 2018-11-17 23:07:57 Flaxseed oil.
3726 2018-11-17 23:07:55 It is actually harder to describe that I thought it would be.

But trust me, if you smell it, you would know.  Maybe it's because I have been around prairie fires so much.  You can smell the dead grass cooking before they ignite.
3727 2018-11-17 23:07:41 tu étais où pour le code du travail? Pour la SNCF? Contre les patrons mafieux? Tu étais où. De plus de très nombreux syndicats ont appelé à manifester y compris CGT. Diminuer les taxes sur gas oïl et essence comme disait G MARCHAIS
3728 2018-11-17 23:07:33 Y’all be getting these damn foreign cars like your cool and got money but can’t even afford an oil change 
3729 2018-11-17 23:07:20 Bcos dis youth defrauding people, I’m sure some wished Dey had beta tyns doing, I’m sure if Dey could be a little support shown to them from d government it will cut the excessiveness in dat act, I look on oda oil exporting Nations I see how Dey support dere youthful population
3730 2018-11-17 23:06:51 Oh and by the way you big fat dumbass, gas prices are coming down as a result of a glut in the oil industry and the subsequent lower price of crude oil!! Not because you scrapped Ontario’s Cap & Trade legislation!
Geeez Louise you really are a jackass moron!! #FordIsDumb
3731 2018-11-17 23:06:49 Interesting, but not surprising.  No mention of the impact of climate change.  When did GOP become science denying....oh yeah, when not doing so impacts their stupid policies and anti-regulation philosophy.  And of course pandering to oil companies.  Pathetic
3732 2018-11-17 23:06:26 Why on earth would we concede access to UK fishing? What next? Oil?

The Common Fisheries Policy is destroying fishing communities. Foreign fishing in UK waters must end as soon as possible. Preferably 29 March 2019.

Just Say No. #BrexitJustSayNo
3733 2018-11-17 23:06:21 @ChrisKingFL Keep the faith. we will need all your help, when red blooms shuts down each beach in Florida, and the tourist capital of the world becomes Deracist's oil drilling swimming pool.  God help us, that cheeseburger eating idiot, will destroy my little Florida..

3735 2018-11-17 23:06:17 The subsidies are being cut back everywhere including Canada as EV's have crossed the magic line. If you really want to know who and what industry is heavily subsidized ...it's our energy sector. We basically give our oil away to these companies. We being we the people.
3736 2018-11-17 23:06:15 Or your CBD oil could taste like oranges  check us out!
3737 2018-11-17 23:06:07 Yummy!  I was at a shoot where they marinated partridge breast with chorizo and chilli oil and barbecued them.  Bloody nectar!!!!!
3738 2018-11-17 23:06:04 When pine needles are baking in the summer sun and you cannot see smoke, but you can smell that aroma of pine but baking...it smells like pine cooking.
3739 2018-11-17 23:06:03 My friend endured several years of on again off again  poison Chemo for his cancer. He was withering away
They gave him year to live so he went alternative and tried Rick Simpson Oil. 6 months later he's cancer free back to work, life
 Don't underestimate the power

3740 2018-11-17 23:06:01 do you need to change anything like the oil?
3741 2018-11-17 23:05:57 rose hip oil is my answer to literally anything
3742 2018-11-17 23:05:52 Perfume I love: £90/100ml EDP
Dupe that isn't the same, but close enough to remind me of perfume I love: ~£1.99/10ml perfume oil.
Perfume: 100ml 1 year daily wear
Dupe: 10ml three months daily wear.

Nobody cares what perfume I wear, as long as it's nice and not strong.
3743 2018-11-17 23:05:48 Changing my cars oil is oddly satisfying... idk if thats a good or bad thing

3749 2018-11-17 23:04:51 My wife and I are both economists. I taught economics & politics and she has 30 years in oil & gas with MNC. We’ve lived & worked globally. Bus driver brother in law still thinks GERS is WM lies and believes in secret oil fields. He’s seen memes.

3751 2018-11-17 23:04:41 It’s impermissible for a surgeon to quit amidst a surgery or offshore engineers to leave during an oil drilling campaign; so why is it ok for MPs to be allowed to resign during negotiations? They should know what they signed up for! It’s not all about the glory! #brexit #flops
3752 2018-11-17 23:04:20 And there's the exclamation point. Zach Neligh 35-yard run, Charlie Spegal 50-yard TD run. @NPHSDragons lead 35-10 with five minutes left. The Dragons, barring lots of weirdness, will be heading back to Lucas Oil Stadium a week from today. @GDRsports
3753 2018-11-17 23:04:16 First person to reply suggested CBD oil to help with his seizures. Will keep passing info on as folks comment on the post.
3754 2018-11-17 23:04:09 Have you ever smelled smoking pine?  Have you ever put a magnifying glass on wood or a wood burning tool?

It smells like that.
3755 2018-11-17 23:04:02 Try doing a shot of salt water then one of olive oil. Takes the sting out and protects the vocal chords.
3756 2018-11-17 23:03:45 @TomPerez don't let @BernieSanders use & abuse our party again. There is no need for an old white man who's a snake oil salesmen to be in the Dem ticket

3758 2018-11-17 23:03:40 Funny how that works isn’t it...  same with shingles, they go up with oil, but never come down
3759 2018-11-17 23:03:31 Amen. Oil slick is pretty bitchin' too, but it KILLS me knowing I'll never achieve opal.
3760 2018-11-17 23:03:23 All for that $500 billion of untapped oil Putin has and Trump tried using Tillerson to extract.  No wonder Obama sanctioned them
3761 2018-11-17 23:03:14 Nah I keep my oil changed
3762 2018-11-17 23:03:13 Really wish I was on the beach, tanning, wind blowing threw my hair, and tanning oil right beside me!

3774 2018-11-17 23:00:43 He's using what little power he has here regarding overall foreign policy to leverage SA to keep pumping more oil to "save the family's prince". Trump could give two shits about the guy or the House of Saud. Get Iran and/or Venezuala back on line and he'll let that "house" fall.
3775 2018-11-17 23:00:32 pero en parte el precio esta elevadisimo porque esta enfocado para audiófilos, es un buen producto + snake oil. Claro, quien lo quiera comprar adelante, yo solo aclaraba que hay productos alla afuera que ofrecen resultados similares por la fraccion del precio.
3776 2018-11-17 23:00:29 I’m over 2,000 miles for my oil change bc I have 0 time to go get it done 
3777 2018-11-17 23:00:28 The trouble is we are all complicit.  My heat comes from a wood stove.  While it is not oil based, it does release allot of co2.  But you are right.  It is a life and death matter.
3778 2018-11-17 23:00:22 Nope it burns 2-3 qts of oil in 150 hours

It has a gorgeous scent too! Happy me!
3784 2018-11-17 22:59:30 No this is my country. He is not going to put people in that ruin our National Parks with oil drilling or put people in that have the opposite ideology of what the EPA is. A judge that is there to save his ass, and an Attorney General That has publicly said he is against

3789 2018-11-17 22:58:57 Under the Obama administration, logging, mining, and oil drilling on public lands were drastically reduced, hurting the U.S. Forestry Service’s revenues and creating the perfect conditions for massive wildfires.

3793 2018-11-17 22:58:45 Hello Mark, is there a summary report of how much regime is currently selling oil and to which countries? Appreciate it.
3794 2018-11-17 22:58:31 I am sorry but your marches don't interest me.  
I have a solution and that is the Windyday Concept, which I stole from the OECD Accords of 2010 to have 40% EV by 2017.
WE ALL let the oil lobby block this plan and now every one of you have an argument against EV.

3796 2018-11-17 22:58:08 When will we brave enough to say "enough" to Saudi Arabia whom continue to push #Yemen to utter complete catastrophe - is money, oil and geo-political influence really worth our soul and conscience as a Kingdom?
3797 2018-11-17 22:57:40 It's horrible! Especially since the CIA report! But the only thing Trump thinks about is oil, money & Iran. Remember that time he told the Fox reporter "A lot of people kill other people".

3799 2018-11-17 22:57:31 because it’s not destined that we’ll drive gasoline powered engines for decades. Even petro states and oil companies realize their time is running out. Call it crazy greens all you like, but carbon fuels will be history, and soon.
3800 2018-11-17 22:57:29 I demand a oil painting, a few doodles and that you come and paint the walls in my room for free, since I am a regular.

3803 2018-11-17 22:56:58 Unfortunately, if the US cuts ties with the Saudis, the Russians will get cozy with them and then the Middle East will all be Russian allies and we will pay more for oil and have a less stable currency without the petro dollar.
3804 2018-11-17 22:56:56 Thx for cs. 
3805 2018-11-17 22:56:35 All dairy free spreads I've seen contain palm oil. But vitalite is the only one that states it uses sustainable palm oil.
3806 2018-11-17 22:56:13 Now that i bottled my first batch of cologne. I only realize now how using only 1 oil per note is going to make it smell really cheap.
3807 2018-11-17 22:55:43 I’ll sell it to you man, it’s well maintained had the oil changed every 3,000 miles
3808 2018-11-17 22:55:20 I am tempted to buy fuel and keep in the gate house... I've been muling this idea for some time as i don't trust these oil marketers and i may have to travel home for Christmas...
3809 2018-11-17 22:55:18 Oil prices had a record 12 day lossing streak. This was despite Saudi Arabia asking major exporters to cut production. 
@realDonaldTrump blasted the Saudi plan of cutting oil production on Twitter. Experts are saying that tweet had an impact. 
Twitter diplomacy does work.
3810 2018-11-17 22:54:53 Couldn't you ask similar Qs about perceptions of Trudeau? "Would prefer if oil industry collapsed?" "Dislikes small business owners?" 'Prefers immigrants to native born Canadians?"
3811 2018-11-17 22:54:34 lmfao when jc was repeating how much oil emma put, i felt that bc i would break out for days

3813 2018-11-17 22:54:14 As a family we are having a go at cutting out Palm Oil.  Difficult as it's in everything from biscuits to shampoo.
3814 2018-11-17 22:54:07 Wish it said "You're in Oil Country"
3815 2018-11-17 22:53:51 I don’t think I have literally went for an oil change w anyone ever

3822 2018-11-17 22:53:19 Even if the electricity comes from coal, it's still less CO2 than ICE car. EVs are about 85% efficient. ICE cars 15% efficient. Plus energy to refine and transport oil. And the UK grid is getting greener every day. Some days we burn no coal at all.
3823 2018-11-17 22:53:09 Ah go on then you smooth talking snake oil salesman...

3830 2018-11-17 22:52:11 High quality CBD oil is not cheap. But, you will not regret it! We highly recommend @NuLeafNaturals
3831 2018-11-17 22:52:07 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
3832 2018-11-17 22:52:03 Merkel & Schroeder have sold out Germany committing cultural suicide. In 10 years or less it will be an Islamic Deutchlanistan getting oil from Tehran & wishing  historical monuments & Churches hadnt been removed or vandalized by the Muslim invaders invited by corrupt officials.

3834 2018-11-17 22:51:53 I felt the same. He did a good job of it apart from flashing the Rolex and cuff links. I kinda got sucked in... but then again, I’m a newbie so can have trouble smelling the snake oil 
3835 2018-11-17 22:51:27 First weekend off and I went to Marshall's out of boredom and got an olive oil bottle. I just wanna go back to work at this point
3836 2018-11-17 22:51:04 Adulting is saying “that’s so much oil” ten times
3837 2018-11-17 22:51:02 や、おっぱいでけえ
3838 2018-11-17 22:51:01 Yes... Yes, we are. 9/11 should've been enough to cut them off so how much more blood for oil will it take?

Just one more reason going to green energy is in the best interest of our national defense!

3847 2018-11-17 22:49:47 No oil change in an #EV
3848 2018-11-17 22:49:21 おはよう
3849 2018-11-17 22:49:09 Disagree.

If not for the Saudis flooding world mkt in the 80's & tanking price of oil, the Soviet Union never falls. 

The mullahs, Iranian expansionism, and a desire to pipe Iranian gas to the EU are driving things.  Pdop worked on isreal/Greece/EU pipeline.

3852 2018-11-17 22:49:03 Having lived in California 2014-2016, the management of forests was terrible.  They were like tinder boxes.  Pine needles, underbrush, fallen trees and limbs uncleared.  

It smelled like it was about to ignite in the summer.  I was always leery of walking trails.
3853 2018-11-17 22:49:02 People like Rob lying about Heidi and her record. The way Port wrote about Heidi he was very much like a spurned lover, not just a run of the mill political hack paid by the oil and gas lobby
3854 2018-11-17 22:49:00 Got my cousin giving me hot oil treatment
3855 2018-11-17 22:49:00 Thx for speaking up for her.  She's the reason I started researching the other Industrialized Nations that aren't under the thumb of Big Business / Big Oil.  Her beliefs are what America wants, it's the word Socialism we didn't seem to understand.  It works No Big $$ in Politics

3857 2018-11-17 22:48:55 That's like saying the oil companies should work on increasing car mileage.

A great idea, but they're the very reason why mileage standards have been suppressed.

3864 2018-11-17 22:48:07 The GOP are funded by Big Oil, they vote against environmental protections that would have helped combat climate change. Climate Change makes weather more severe, increases droughts, fires. SHAME!!! #ClimateAction He talks out of both sides of his mouth
3865 2018-11-17 22:47:56 Demonstrations in #France about the cost of fuel, have kicked off, not before time. Somewhere the oil cartels are holding us all to ransom, for no apparent reason !.
3866 2018-11-17 22:47:54 SPLC also. Years ago they actually stood for American values
3867 2018-11-17 22:47:43 Venezuela is not going to get their gold. They're deadbeats who don't pay their bills for goods outside the country anymore. One of my oil contacts told me Venezuela owes everyone a lot of $$$ for oil equipment & never pays now. They go from supplier to supplier trying to steal
3868 2018-11-17 22:47:38 Has anyone in your vicinity ever discussed how crude oil clumps and sinks in the open ocean?
No? Odd, given your interest.
3869 2018-11-17 22:47:28 Have my oil tanker identified
3870 2018-11-17 22:46:43 My daddy better be lucky he did my oil change. I be wanting to tell him no when he ask me to be his driver.
3871 2018-11-17 22:46:26 What oil do you use to fry your chicken and fries?
3872 2018-11-17 22:45:58 TS CASANARE y LUIS GABRIEL  LIEVANO lamenta el fallecimiento del Geologo Nelson Arango, gran vecino y amigo; lamentable esta pérdida para el Departamento del Casanare valiosos los aportes que nos dio al Cluster Oil & Gas. Paz en su tumba y resignación a su esposa e hijos.
3873 2018-11-17 22:45:45 From France Fuck Macron

Tax on oil, not on plane, boat.

Some people ready to loose their job due taxes.

Another taxes cut the country.

STOP IT 
3874 2018-11-17 22:45:35 Shit. I forgot to take some CBD oil this morning. Lower back is killin me. Need to keep some in my car. Lol
3875 2018-11-17 22:44:44 Lessons Ive learned from changing my own oil:

1. Buy the cheap shit
2. Don’t do it yourself you fucking dummy what do you think you’re some kind of mechanic!?!? NO YOURE A HEAD ASS!
3876 2018-11-17 22:44:38 You have a wonderful government. She has committed so many crimes around the world, but it's why you get cheap petrol. liter of blood spilled - liter of oil. Acceptable.
3877 2018-11-17 22:44:34 The oil in the seeds can cause them to go rancid. You'd have noticed after the first one.
3878 2018-11-17 22:44:31 Did you roast the broccoli in the oven? My wife loves that, or brussel sprouts with a coconut oil glaze.
3879 2018-11-17 22:44:30 No mention of the fugitive methane emissions from oil / gas exploration / production by stimulation ( franking or acidization)

3883 2018-11-17 22:43:52 Reads like a line taken straight from the George H.W. Bush handbook on covering for his Saudi Arabian brotherhood in oil.
3884 2018-11-17 22:43:35 Barrels of Oil went from $1.73 in 1973  to $35 in 1981.   #hist112

3886 2018-11-17 22:43:28 How to smell good/fresh all day;
-take morning showers
-put on lotion right after you shower(best if the same scent as your shower gel)
-use same scent shampoo and conditioner 
-use shea butter or coconut oil 
-rub some vaseline on your neck then spray perfume to last all day
3887 2018-11-17 22:43:05 Climate change legislation is an stupid stupid idea, all the banter about it has left our oil industry crippled, for no reason other than false virtue

3893 2018-11-17 22:42:18 Yes it was. The owners of vehicle were very mad and thought I was responsible and wanted me to buy them another engine oil pan. I had to physically show them the engine oil pan problem so they could see for themselves it was not my fault!
3894 2018-11-17 22:41:59 @VirginTrains for the love of god will you oil your fold down tables

3900 2018-11-17 22:41:06 Within one cup pour vinegar and oil,
And look! unblent, unreconciled, they war.
So in the twofold issue of the strife
Mingle the victor's shout, the captives' moan.
3901 2018-11-17 22:41:03 I'm having good luck with a 10:1 CBD oil, putting it in capsules and swallowing it. Hits faster than the regular caps, no idea why. CBD something, I imagine.
3902 2018-11-17 22:40:53 They're deadbeats who don't pay any of their bills. One of my contacts told me that their national oil company stiffs everyone and never pays but demands oil parts shipped first before payment is made
3903 2018-11-17 22:40:41 The PM stands on his own, Vickie, and does it very well. it's not Gerald who attends the town halls where trued faces whatever is directed at him, openly and honestly. And the oil sector? Why would you make such a silly statement? No one wants the oil sector to fail: most...
3904 2018-11-17 22:40:35 I’ve never understood this argument in Canada. Almost every product or commodity in Canada has some form of price control, usually through govt subsidy. 

Almost every rental property in Toronto was built with CMHC (taxpayer) dollars. Oil, dairy, wheat, etc all controlled.

3908 2018-11-17 22:39:58 But I have to say that palm oil has ruined most frostings. A) it makes me sick and b) I can’t kill baby orangutans just to eat it.
3909 2018-11-17 22:39:46 I like my coconut oil unrefined, but I like my men refined
3910 2018-11-17 22:39:36 All companies involved need to be charged lots yearly to operate in our country. Dirty oil.
3911 2018-11-17 22:39:32 #RT @SexAdviceBot: Spice up your sex life with an essential oil!
3912 2018-11-17 22:39:26 Hmmmn

Marc Rich was wanted for a list of charges going back decades. He had traded illegally with America’s enemies including Ayatollah Khomeini’s Iran, where he bought about $200 million worth of oil while revolutionaries allied with Khomeini held 53 American hostages in 1979
3913 2018-11-17 22:39:21 If he looked at any sort of chart over the last decade, Nat Gas is almost always a seasonal trade from October into Jan - Feb. Obviously it doesn't usually exploded like this while oil goes the opposite direction... but come on. Haha. He better get use to drinking water.
3914 2018-11-17 22:39:03 At what price? Our Democracy? is this fat man dealing with authoritarian kingship for bullshit oil money where are the electric cars??
3915 2018-11-17 22:38:55 This customer just asked me if we sold funnel and i hit him wit da meanest huh? Whole time he talkin bout oil funnels
3916 2018-11-17 22:38:47 As a country our govt are subsidising the fossil fuel industries by millions yet removing subsidies from renewables. An oil exploration site 1 mike from me has burnet 1.5 million cu ft of gas in 1 month when experts say we cannot burn all known reserves why look for more?
3917 2018-11-17 22:38:43 Lmaooo girl my whole body feeling dry & dehydrated ... Like howwww with all this damn coconut oil
3918 2018-11-17 22:38:41  so the credit exposure is less than the last time oil collapsed IMO, still has risk but reduced I believe
3919 2018-11-17 22:38:40 “What type of oil you want today?”
“Uhm I think my girls car takes wd-40”
LMFAO WHAT

3922 2018-11-17 22:38:00 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
3923 2018-11-17 22:37:54 This is just the US cosying up to the Saudis again to get an arms deal done and get some oil
3924 2018-11-17 22:37:35 asking for a friend... is there such thing as too much cuticle oil??
3925 2018-11-17 22:37:29 do switch up products in your hair. like if you been using dove don’t change to something new it’ll thin out your hair, but if you haven’t already you should try coconut oil it’s great for hair. the only way naturally to get your hair to grow is by leaving it natural or vitamins
3926 2018-11-17 22:37:26 Well, did Karl max also tell you SMEs are the backbone of any economy.

Karl max spokesperson, no one has said building palm oil mills is a bad tin to do neither is the loan worse. 
Read lightly and U’l see details embedded in them....sleep on it.
3927 2018-11-17 22:37:23 Went to @NTB for a routine inspection and oil change, said it would be a 90 min wait. No problem. Call me 30 mins later saying I need to replace power steering pump, but have the part and technician on standby. It’s now been 4.5 hours. #terribleservice #dobetter
3928 2018-11-17 22:36:43 avon had a lovely skinsosoft dry oil spray. Is Avon gone now?
3929 2018-11-17 22:36:40 So done with this BS, so am homeschooling my grandkids 
3930 2018-11-17 22:36:39 My favorite kind. 

Seems like I find a new one every week. Been on shale oil in North America and the tech to get it for week now. Crazy stuff.
3931 2018-11-17 22:36:39 منهو الجبير ؟ 
3932 2018-11-17 22:36:30 Idiot has no idea and is trying to cover for his climate change denying BS and pushing for more coal and oil. Further, these two fires appear to be arson and erupted on 11/8, the day after the Thousand Oaks shooting and two days after the mid-terms, which the right lost bigly.
3933 2018-11-17 22:36:28 Money is funny it is not real and done times it sticks and sometimes it floats away no King was rich one second after his physical form passed so in joy your self as you and all will become moss and rust soon and no oil will stop the process
3934 2018-11-17 22:36:20 Little late now, but hopefully (although I am doubtful) @marty_walsh and/or the council will stop it. I cannot fathom removing the name Yawkey - a family who has contributed greatly to the city, but saving a  Venezuelan oil company’s  sign! Makes NO Sense.
3935 2018-11-17 22:36:19 Excuse me have you not been paying attention to me running around in nothing but my underpants and some olive oil taking pictures in pools of water all over ancient Greece?!
3936 2018-11-17 22:36:06 *clears throat* spare tire, jack, flashlight, extra heals, extra jacket, sea shells, books, antifreeze, extra taillight bulbs, a fedora, extra engine oil, lots of empty wrappers.
3937 2018-11-17 22:36:05 And how did that go as far as getting our oil to other markets than the US?? We essentially have 1 customer for our oil and we continue to this day to import oil, which is crazy.
3938 2018-11-17 22:35:54 Lauren : “when i was younger my mom used to mop with Murthy’s Oil Soap, and when she’d put the mop away i’d suck on the mop” WTF HOW AREN’T YOU DEAD
3939 2018-11-17 22:35:54 Sana oil
3940 2018-11-17 22:35:32 @wingstop off of west colonial was horrible today.  I've been going to them for 5 years and never had a problem. I ordered the 30 dollar wing special and my food was in a pool of oil. I wanted a refund and they did not do so. Poor customer service today...
3941 2018-11-17 22:35:26 It's crude oil or a healthy Gulf of Mexico. In Trumpistan, it's all about the crude.
3942 2018-11-17 22:35:23 Protein treatment?? Is it like a whole routine?? I usually put olive oil in my hair occasionally before a wash but my leave-in conditioner is just garbage and doesn’t moisturise it properly
3943 2018-11-17 22:34:59 200K for a new transmission 
17K for CVT Oil.
15K for Rear Engine Mount
25K for the machanic labor. 

I'm going to cry to bed.
3944 2018-11-17 22:34:25 Next stop: Oil replacement! NEXTNEXT stop: heater coil flush
3945 2018-11-17 22:34:21 Atiku probably saw the various proposals to restructure the national oil company and quickly approximated it to his desire to buy it all. Ole. We are not selling to Intels. Move the producing assets into NLNG model, IPO the salvageable unrelated ones and sell off the duds.
3946 2018-11-17 22:34:19 Same! I use the cream and oil and it's done wonders for my anxiety and back pain!
3947 2018-11-17 22:34:06 Mingo is good any way you cook it. We like it pan seared in olive oil with some seafood seasoning and butter/capers. It is also good fried or baked or grilled. You can’t go wrong. Enjoy @jasternke
3948 2018-11-17 22:34:06 They are cleaned after every trip to the range. But, occasionally I feel guilty enough to pull everything out of the safe and put a fresh coat of oil on them and check for corrosion.
3949 2018-11-17 22:33:58 Your elites fail to acknowledge your universally known educational problem which has cost you so much up north, and put your southern counterparts on a better path generally. But here you are as a youth I suppose, leading  this ridiculous and unfortunate campaign.
3950 2018-11-17 22:33:54 Going off on a tangent here 2 show the impractical nature of coal as a means 2 "power" the world.  The Bergius Process used 2 produce synthetic oil was used extensively by Nazi Germany 2 fuel its fleet of cars, planes & even this proved to be nothing more than a last resource.
3951 2018-11-17 22:33:51 If you've got oil, you can do what you like. If your dream boy Jeremy got the top job, he'd do the same. You say he won't, but you know he will.
3952 2018-11-17 22:33:40 yo lo desmiento no cargaste nafta cargaste gas oil
3953 2018-11-17 22:33:32 The gari on waakye is mixed with oil
3954 2018-11-17 22:33:30 Well its that 'im happy and comfortable so who cares about anyone else' ya those types of people are what vote these gov'ts in...a lot  here in Calgary ..BUT...oil industry is now suffering and its burst their bubbles! When a person is personally affected is when change happens..
3955 2018-11-17 22:33:05 Western propaganda to sell soy and canola oil worldwide since they can’t grow palm. I wonder what they bulldozed to plant all that soy and canola? Hypocrites!
3956 2018-11-17 22:33:04 and if I’m a stain to you, I hope I’m an oil stain. Beautiful on the way out and hard to get rid of.
3957 2018-11-17 22:33:02 Be careful with the little kitties, don’t use any tea tree oil products.. it’s extremely poisonous to cats
3958 2018-11-17 22:32:50 There is zero connection between the two. Gas prices are down because the price of oil is down
3959 2018-11-17 22:32:36 Coconut oil is the new sudocream
3960 2018-11-17 22:32:27 Think he’s been tanning the whiskey. It’s not our oil either. It belongs to those who have licences to extract it
3961 2018-11-17 22:32:25 First day of using CBD oil and I've gone into the worst hip and knee pain flare I've had for a while  #cbdoil #chronicpain
3962 2018-11-17 22:32:23 We would have been better off doing the opposite of what the health establishment has been preaching.

Meat, not grains
Saturated fat, not polyunsaturated seed oil garbage
Lifting weights, not jogging

It takes unique talent to get everything so wrong.
3963 2018-11-17 22:32:11 So what does all that mean for Lp(a) patients? My child is being given Fish Oil and told to increase fish consumption. If this will increase her CV risk, is this not bringing her health into a larger pot of problems?
3964 2018-11-17 22:31:59 Lots of dirty palm oil out there!  Lots of dirty palm oil!
3965 2018-11-17 22:31:24 I don’t know who needs to hear this, but go ahead and get that oil change.
3966 2018-11-17 22:31:21 I just wonder how Muslims would be perceived had they not been interfered with or there'd be no oil in the desert. I don't think you'd have these problems.
3967 2018-11-17 22:31:14 nako tulog mantika si jonamar! sana oil.
3968 2018-11-17 22:30:53 We don’t need to harvest fossil fuels. Renewables are something we could use instead, big oil has money vested in politics. We are contributing to climate change. Ask a scientist about it.. we have little time to curb our canon emissions. Before the damage we do is irreversible.
3969 2018-11-17 22:30:36 Idea:
Uno those primary school songs like "He's got the whole world in his hands" or "Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning"? That, but techno remix
3970 2018-11-17 22:30:31 Reminds me. I'm keenly aware of just how "big oil" brainwashed friends in O&G over decades. Obvious, and I noticed things, ie I sat next to a top climate denier "scientist" and we chatted as we had a friend in common. But note: He'd just won a $2M hospital home lotto. Pay off. 
3971 2018-11-17 22:30:09 not sure if applying coconut oil is good for a headache but I applied some to my scalp and now I smell like a cookie and that is what I call progress #TheHomeBodiesCollective
3972 2018-11-17 22:30:02 "Grapefruit", "Cranberry", or "Motor Oil With Cranberry Liqueur"? They're all great!
3973 2018-11-17 22:29:57 I would invent a Dairy Milk that is palm oil free. Just found out you've been named as palm oil users. I've had 47 Cadbury Christmases, but my 48th will sadly be Cadbury free. I'm waiting for you to ditch palm oil. Make it right for my 49th Christmas.
3974 2018-11-17 22:29:50 There isn’t much difference between SaudiA and NKorea. The only is one sits on pile of oil and the other a pile of nukes. Extra-judicial killings outside their countries seems to be choice operations!
3975 2018-11-17 22:29:48 My point and yours are somewhat different as you may see when you read the article. This government and many previous ones help the oil industry. Understanding is different from position.
3976 2018-11-17 22:29:46 Nolan Ryan's old oil baron Texan buddies made fun of him because Lewin made Seinfeld references on air.
3977 2018-11-17 22:29:45 We call Sal Cannella “Oil” because he’s so smooth
3978 2018-11-17 22:29:26 Ashe immediately ducked beneath her side of the countertop as the gunshot rang out, almost dropping her bag. With wide eyes, she peeked over the counter to see oil dripping all over it.

"Jesse, you damn idiot!" She gasped, knuckles white, hands shaking. They'd thieved and --
3979 2018-11-17 22:29:24 If only there was an alternative to oil.......................
Who funds Sporting venues etc?
3980 2018-11-17 22:29:23 @hasanminhaj and @patriotact — this segment is so on point. That’s why @ocasio2018, @justicedems and @sunrisemvmt are working to popularize a #GreenNewDeal and break the chokehold Big Oil has on our democracy. Would so love to chat w you about it!
3981 2018-11-17 22:29:20 Just applied my happiness lotion and focus oil ... I feel amazing and overly productive
3982 2018-11-17 22:29:17 I wanna kill everyone and everything at work and I wish I could just blast yuth forever to cope but these hippie ass people only wanna listen to the “coconut oil sunshine music” radio station 
3983 2018-11-17 22:29:03 Anybody got any CBD oil?
3984 2018-11-17 22:29:00 You also help some fine folks blow up an oil field
3985 2018-11-17 22:28:59 ive seen other people do it by touching the oil/foundation on their face and then wiping that on the camera and it flares the glitter loads x
3986 2018-11-17 22:28:42 Tuned in for the night - first to #SnowballDerby preview practice sessions on @speed51dotcom then Lucas Oil Mods and @SRLSWTourSeries finale at the LVMS Bullring on @LucasRacingTV.
3987 2018-11-17 22:28:42 .@hasanminhaj and @patriotact — this segment is so on point. That’s why @ocasio2018, @justicedems and @sunrisemvmt are working to popularize a #GreenNewDeal and break the chokehold Big Oil has on our democracy. Would so love to chat w you about it!
3988 2018-11-17 22:28:40 In the Middle East it has been similar with oil, and all over the world they've been used to pressure/undermine local governments on things wages to ensure cheap production of goods continues.
3989 2018-11-17 22:28:27 Essential skunk oil
3990 2018-11-17 22:28:19 going on online paranormal boards is like a french fry going into a pan of hot, hot canola oil
3991 2018-11-17 22:27:48 @IcelandFoods please correct me if I’m wrong, you still sell products with palm oil Cadbury’s being one.  Surely they should be off the suppliers list?
3992 2018-11-17 22:27:33 Hey anyone use rose hip seed oil to get rid of acne scars?
3993 2018-11-17 22:27:31 to the lady waiting for her oil change at jiffy lube outside in the HAZARDOUS air quality with her uncovered baby in the stroller yes I’m staring at you bc I’m judging the shit out of you.
3994 2018-11-17 22:27:25 oil changes take entirely too long
3995 2018-11-17 22:26:52 I come home and my dad changed my oil, my air filters, windshield wipers, got me gas, AND put an air freshener in my car. I know I say this all the time but how did I get so lucky!!!!
3996 2018-11-17 22:26:19 The only way is to focus on fixing the climate, oil and coal stop being an issue to occupy and murder and suck up over... Everyone stops fighting. Peace keepers supply people with aid before Daesh do. We get a super efficient global police force to round up violent fanatics.
3997 2018-11-17 22:26:17 John, for me it’s not about the impact of climate change. I believe that it’s going to happen and there is little man can do about it. I just don’t want to go from one bad choice to another. I believe there will be a source much better than solar or oil soon.
3998 2018-11-17 22:26:15 Hey @hasanminhaj and @patriotact!As a youth climate activist I loved this segment. @Ocasio2018, @justicedems and @sunrisemvmt are working to popularize a #GreenNewDeal and break the chokehold Big Oil has on our democracy. Got any time to chat?
3999 2018-11-17 22:26:08 Mixing it in a go spoils De taste...De oil get into De rice too much..
4000 2018-11-17 22:25:58 No, it was not I who presented you with that choice. It was atmospheric physics. The greenhouse effect, and climate change, is real. Even the largest multinational oil companies--and the Trump DOJ, when forced to go in front of judges--acknowledges those realities. You should too
4001 2018-11-17 22:25:58 “If you look at oil prices they’ve come down very substantially over the last couple of months,That’s because of me.” - President Trump
4002 2018-11-17 22:25:39 But like, if I were to get a hamburger with cheese, wouldn’t that just be a cheese burger? Also, what’s the deal with vegetable oil, crazy stuff man...
4003 2018-11-17 22:25:35 Hmm reminds me I have to do that too now... Along with tires and oil yay.....
4004 2018-11-17 22:25:30 maybe in 2019 y’all will finally stop thinking coconut oil is a moisturizer
4005 2018-11-17 22:25:19 Only a matter of time before oil sands operations start moth balling plants, lay off work force and wait for a better financial climate.
4006 2018-11-17 22:25:17 FF14欲がようやく高まってきた( ˊᵕˋ )なお装備はry
4007 2018-11-17 22:25:00 Practically a snake oil selling quack then? 
4008 2018-11-17 22:24:54 Advice: Don't use the fruit of the lime, only the peel.  The citrus oil reacts nicely with the gin.  The juice does not.
4009 2018-11-17 22:24:51 Sorry fancy pants restaurants everywhere, but butter goes better with bread than oil
4010 2018-11-17 22:24:40 Same with Mackinnon. Didn’t have his huge breakout year until a season after he signed it
4011 2018-11-17 22:24:27 I just got my medical order delivered. Still have not missed a beat. Order oil 1:1 12.5 capsules and some flower. What were you missing ?
4012 2018-11-17 22:24:01 @tan123 Oil barrel prices are extremely low, but there's been little to no change at the pump. Gas monopolies are profiting even more!!!!
4013 2018-11-17 22:23:58 TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.
4014 2018-11-17 22:23:42 also Schiefele signed his deal after playing three years. He had career high at that point of 61 points. It has worked out for Jets, but doesn't Draisaitl deal overpay. He makes same as Wheeler starting next year for 5 years. Wheeler will be 33, Draisaitl 24. No deals are same.
4015 2018-11-17 22:23:35 You say gunk and I think of changing oil or swimming in pond scum.
4016 2018-11-17 22:23:23 Hey @hasanminhaj! Absolutely loved this episode. Wanted to share w you that @Ocasio2018, @justicedems and @sunrisemvmt are working to popularize a #GreenNewDeal and break the chokehold that Big Oil has on our politics. Would love to chat w you about it!
4017 2018-11-17 22:23:22 Nothing wrong with protesting, so have at it.  Just keep in mind you use more oil than you think and to change that, your entire life and those around you would have to change dramatically.  Imagine life with no plastic for example.
4018 2018-11-17 22:23:19 What
4019 2018-11-17 22:23:14 NRMA why is fuel an average 35 cents a liter more in NSW than in Qld $161 in Northern NSW $124 average in Gold Coast ?  Whats going on ?  The oil price has dropped why not the bowser price.
4020 2018-11-17 22:23:09 Central bears are semi state champions!!! See you at Lucas oil on Friday!!!
4021 2018-11-17 22:23:06 @Oreo please stop using palm oil that is not sustainably sourced and which destroys rainforests.
4022 2018-11-17 22:23:05 Also there will be a side seminar about how used motor oil can be used to fertilize your lawn.
4023 2018-11-17 22:23:00 The Tony Blair economic policy? Some cheap oil is needed.....
4024 2018-11-17 22:22:57 Today must be the day for oil changes.
4025 2018-11-17 22:22:52 Give it a rest... Snake oil sales'wo'man
4026 2018-11-17 22:22:51 How you betting on trump investments in mid-east oil?
4027 2018-11-17 22:22:47 You know how adults, like your parents and grandparents, have life hacks they've developed over the years? I've just found my first one. Jiffy blueberry muffin mix makes an amazing coffee cake - all you need is the mix, an egg, some milk and oil, and the box is less than $1.
4028 2018-11-17 22:22:38 Great panel at #MESA2018 with @karinewalther, Nelida Fuccaro, @gbrew24 and Nathan Citino. Fascinating discussion on oil, development, methodology, and interdisciplinary work. Can't wait to read the new work by these scholars.
4029 2018-11-17 22:22:21 My dad prayed over me this morning as I was waking up. I swear his energy is healing and he did it without his oil 
4030 2018-11-17 22:22:19 Evansville sending two teams to Lucas Oil to play for State championships is pretty cool! SIAC is surely one helluva conference
4031 2018-11-17 22:22:11 Central vs. Fort Wayne Dwenger, Friday at 2:30 p.m. from Lucas Oil Stadium.
4032 2018-11-17 22:21:55 Hahahaha!
4033 2018-11-17 22:21:46 u are: stupid I LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT YOU ALWAYS WASH UR HANDS AFTER USING PEPPERMINT OIL
4034 2018-11-17 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
4035 2018-11-17 22:21:07 
4036 2018-11-17 22:21:06 Got my oil changed...vaccumed my dirty ass car...gonna look for some more threads and get a haircut hopefully

Now this is a good Saturday
4037 2018-11-17 22:20:53 Pumpkin Butt teething oil!
4038 2018-11-17 22:20:37 I just knew I had my life together when I got new tires, an oil change, and new brakes.  Then I blew a wheel bearing on my way to work 
4039 2018-11-17 22:20:15 I can’t believe how uninformed you are, Alberta Oil is selling for $15/bbl due to no pipelines and oil companies are shutting production in while Canada imports oil from countries with no human rights. It is a crisis in Alberta
4040 2018-11-17 22:20:08 Funny old world. Only a few years ago, especially during the Gulf wars, many Cypriots would say, if Cyprus had oil the problem would have been solved and Turkey held to account. Ιδού το γκάζι, ουδέν αλλαγή. How about for some clean wind, wave and solar power?
4041 2018-11-17 22:20:01 Macron is inflicting France with Austerity on fuel and cost of living, soon the price of Oil will bite the French, it will bite us Brits and entire of Europe, come next year Crude Oil will skyrocket.
4042 2018-11-17 22:19:58 @Ritzcrackers stop drop palm oil
4043 2018-11-17 22:19:57 Speaking of Saudi Arabia, it seems no one is concerned we are armed and assisting them in trying to wipe Yemen off the map. Not to mention the humanitarian crisis that's in full swing.  It's ok though because we're oil buddies so we'll overlook the whole murder thing
4044 2018-11-17 22:19:30 But he doesn't really think overseas military intervention is a waste, it's just that the USA hasn't gone far enough for his taste. He wanted to "go in and get their oil," after all.
4045 2018-11-17 22:19:26 For the first time ever, @CentralBearsFB is headed to Lucas Oil!!!

They beat Marion 30-14 to win the 4A @IHSAA1 Semi-State title.

@CentralBearsCHS now faces Fort Wayne Bishop Dwenger for all the marbles next Friday at 3:30 p.m. ET.

Catch coverage of today's game at 10!
4046 2018-11-17 22:19:22 nothing like having a game sponsored by snake oil
4047 2018-11-17 22:19:20 Strangely the more it drops the better we do. Weaker pound more overseas income. 

By the way every cent we drop against US  earns the revenue 1 bn GBP more on oil and gas. 

This is why Germany wants the Euro. Weak Euro lots of trade. Strong Deutschemark no trade.
4048 2018-11-17 22:19:15 I just want a palm oil free version of Nutella that doesn't taste shite
4049 2018-11-17 22:19:09 This one Na bleached body like oil spillage wey bleach fish for OGONI
4050 2018-11-17 22:19:06 I hate getting my oil changed because my car is such a mess rip
4051 2018-11-17 22:19:00 I was playing around with some used fire wood, decided to put cooking oil in charcoal, and accidentally made oil pastels! (Or at least the basic concept of it.)
4052 2018-11-17 22:19:00 The real 45! Also, put that on your vanifesto, Trump Snake Oil Drinker
4053 2018-11-17 22:18:59 Poor as education is in that certain area in Cross River State and other southern states, unity school candidates would still make between 80-139 marks to gain admission, while the northerners that they aren't better than make 2-7 marks to gain same admission.
4054 2018-11-17 22:18:56 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
4055 2018-11-17 22:18:53 not really a brand, but the best olive oil I've had has been from stores that sell nothing but olive oil. I've seen them in Berkeley and Portland, so there's got to be at least one in New York
4056 2018-11-17 22:18:52 Jamaican black castor oil straight from the heavens bruh
4057 2018-11-17 22:18:46 Not much oil in those containers...Well, maybe processed canola.
4058 2018-11-17 22:18:44 @BBCNewsPR Coverage of French oil prices & Paradise forest fires but nothing about #ExtinctionRebellion London protests? #ForceforChange #Wakeupandsmellthecarbon #ActNow #ActOnClimate
4059 2018-11-17 22:18:43 I need to get my twist outs to start lasting a week cause my shit will be dry by day 3 and oil only makes it dry quicker
4060 2018-11-17 22:18:41 That is a spurious argument.   Concealment does not work in the age of the internet.  Further,  China is doing that.   They just don't think Trump is important.   What's important is oil, commodities, and markets on a global scale.
4061 2018-11-17 22:18:20 @Oreo stop drop palm oil!!!!
4062 2018-11-17 22:18:18 Well I've got Xmas presents to buy, car insurance, oil change, rent, phone, cable. If I didn't have all that... never.
4063 2018-11-17 22:17:47 Stop palm oil
4064 2018-11-17 22:17:46 Standing on Canadian oil , keeping it in the ground , to kill Canada
4065 2018-11-17 22:17:45 I like the idea. We pipe oil and gas everywhere.   There are rivers, ponds, reservoirs, etc all over. Pumps can be reversed.
4066 2018-11-17 22:17:42 I’m literally sane now after picking up some oil from Cannabis NB. Thank you Trudeau 
4067 2018-11-17 22:17:38 You could use some of this enthusiasm in the job Alberta taxpayers are actually PAYING you to do.
You’ve managed to eliminate more than 100,000 good paying jobs through increased taxes, regulations such as Bill C-69, the carbon tax, total lack of effort to get our oil to market. – bij Alberta

4070 2018-11-17 22:17:20 jc’s obsession with oil
4071 2018-11-17 22:17:18 Making steam for a 100,000 bbl/d SAGD project with a steam/oil ratio of 2.50 would generate approximately 2.16 Mt (megatonnes) of CO2 annually. Total GHG emissions for Canada in 2015 was 722 Mt.
4072 2018-11-17 22:17:15 Any cuzzos sell almond oil? 
4073 2018-11-17 22:16:59 Economic Sanctions? So you must be talking about exports, right?
Can you provide any evidence that VEN's economic disaster is due to sanctions, and not due to their exports being basically 95% Oil and the barrel dropping from $140 to $27?
4074 2018-11-17 22:16:58 Wind turbines look horrible. Solar is the best option. But we all know oil will be here for quite some time.
4075 2018-11-17 22:16:52 Who is a snake oil salesman? I think you should DYOR before drunk-tweeting. The problem we, Venezuelans in exile, are trying to solve needs no answer...but if it makes you happy: dollarization through crypto / stablecoins.
4076 2018-11-17 22:16:52 Pain, anxiety, and depression. I smoke it, vape it, bake with it, and use CBD oil.
4077 2018-11-17 22:16:21 Take my car to get a oil change they ask where’s my man take my car to get service they say the same thing like look idk shit 
4078 2018-11-17 22:16:20 yes he was short batty calls and short oil puts. YouTube has the SAs video.. 300,000,000 lost
4079 2018-11-17 22:16:06 Recently I challenged someones views regarding palm oil destroying habitats the individual I was up against refuses to see the bigger picture that animal products are the number one cause of environmental destruction yet they still choose to eat the standard american diet.
4080 2018-11-17 22:16:04 Anytime you're about to use something with palm oil in it, have a wank instead
4081 2018-11-17 22:15:55 Used to. Coconut oil is good enough for me.
4082 2018-11-17 22:15:38 i finally got an oil change after 7 months, shut up i know
4083 2018-11-17 22:15:32 Yes. Everyhwere in Nigeria needs help in terms of education, but to say that the South is no better than the North because of a certain result from a rural place in Cross River is very laughable.
4084 2018-11-17 22:15:29 If this was another country we'd have troops on the ground. (If they had oil.)
4085 2018-11-17 22:15:22 So he's gonna stop drilling for oil and mining for coal? Push towards renewable energy? Re-join the Paris Accord???
4086 2018-11-17 22:15:11 What a beautiful Shatterday! Save $5.00 an every gram of Oil!
4087 2018-11-17 22:15:06 Trump Calls Saudi Arabia A 'Spectacular Ally' Despite CIA's Khashoggi Findings:AZZHOL IS RIGHT THEY ARE A "SPECTACULAR ALLY FOR HIS PHUK'N CROOKED AZZ REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS WHO ARE ROBBING THE "REAL" AMERICAN PEOPLE BLIND WITH THEIR OUTRAGEOUS GASOLINE$
4088 2018-11-17 22:14:51 $UNG so does this get affected by crude oil prices or by the weather? Or both?
4089 2018-11-17 22:14:49 How income is obtained is irrelevant. Oil rich countries give a free stipend to their citizens just for being loyal.

Wealthy kids inherit free riches from their parents.

Poor people must work backbreaking labor for a dime.

All of them buy from the same, impersonal market.
4090 2018-11-17 22:14:45 Corn  must be the new oil
4091 2018-11-17 22:13:50 That doesn't make it right though. Trump doesn't want that work he'd rather keep good relationship with Saudi anyway too much money involved. They buy oil off them and america sell them weapons. Saudi regime is hella corrupt! Aswell as America.

4093 2018-11-17 22:13:30 This dude loves Gore’s intentions. Gore gave us a surge to nuclear energy at the TVA (a then almost wholly renewable hydropower system) in the 70’s after embracing consensus science that we’d be flat out of oil by 1980. And as VP gave us consensus “harmless” MTBE gas, carcinogen

4097 2018-11-17 22:12:54 The good thing about I-69 is the teams that got their butts handed to them down here can have a quicker drive back home while Memorial and Central will have a enjoyable drive to Lucas Oil next week.

4102 2018-11-17 22:12:16 Hi there. I see you are still supporting 96 million bpd from other countries while demanding that Canada shut in our 4. You also support the 6000 daily tankers moving this oil and oppose a single daily tanker from TMX. Oil, NG and byproducts is our greatest export at $100 B/yr.

4108 2018-11-17 22:11:40 Lol. Are you aware that those are some government school teachers in Cross River State? 
Can you guess the number of privately owned primary and secondary schools in each local government in some southern states like those in the southeast and southwest?
4109 2018-11-17 22:11:35 Why don't you stop using palm oil then and research alternatives?
4110 2018-11-17 22:11:31 Sure, but let’s reverse scenario put McDavid/Scheifele on same club, both RFA at same time. McDavid gets $12.5M, guarantee that Scheifele wouldn’t be getting what he got, he’d be getting Draisaitl money
4111 2018-11-17 22:11:30 Oil
4112 2018-11-17 22:11:19 True true. No argument from me.
Maybe Noll has poured a whole bottle of tangerine essential oil (or something equal to that) on Swirly on purpose. Just to see this happen.
4113 2018-11-17 22:11:10 Grind some frozen veg to as a hot sauce, sesame oil, and salt.
4114 2018-11-17 22:11:03 @jccaylen how much oil was that?
4115 2018-11-17 22:10:57 this is an optical illusion, whether they work for you or not doesn't correlate with stress or anything about your mental health. Whoever posted this is peddling snake oil
4116 2018-11-17 22:10:56 Am a strong supporter of atiku but am not in support of this , privatization is good , but Nigeria oil will definitely go into the wrong hands if not properly negotiated our conditions might get worse
4117 2018-11-17 22:10:51 Pour it holy water and anointing oil. 
Anoint it with hot candle wax since it wants to form jagaban.
4118 2018-11-17 22:10:47 I need to put some oil around my DMs. Maybe then someone would slide in them
4119 2018-11-17 22:10:34 Drop money in oil, and push HARD for renewable sources.
4120 2018-11-17 22:10:27 I swear i love tea tree oil it works for everything !
4121 2018-11-17 22:10:26 True @MrJim1973 Manufactures deliberately design some of their parts to fail prematurely, but what can you do about it?  I remember having to replace an entire engine oil pan on a Ford town car. The fitting for drain plug was not properly welded & spun around w/plug on removal.
4122 2018-11-17 22:10:23 In 2017 the top 30 oil companies in Alberta made $53 billion in revenue.     Govt of all levels only collected $3 billion in royalties, taxes, income taxes.

$53 billion for them, $3 billion for us.     Scheer is nothing more than a front man for foreign-owned oil companies.

4127 2018-11-17 22:10:06 As soon as the family sized bottle of baby oil came out I would have to excuse myself. I'd end up slipping and sliding face first into a wall. It would not be sexy video material.

4132 2018-11-17 22:09:48 Wife asked me to throw out empty boxes of donuts because the smell of donuts oil bothers her.
On the way out, dropped the boxes, spilled all the oil on myself and now I smell like a donuts factory

4135 2018-11-17 22:09:30 Yes. The Scottish Government has blocked fracking in Scotland for now, but still supports offshore oil & gas exploration and I can't see then stopping anytime soon.

I also stick a weighted eye mask in the fridge and put peppermint oil all over my head (scalp, temples, etc)
4147 2018-11-17 22:07:31 Yup but even healthy I believe Blue Jays would be looking to move him due to all the middle infielders in the system. Love to see him stay healthy because the kid can flat out hit.

4153 2018-11-17 22:06:13 This is a success of the climate movement. It's just that up until now few legislators have been willing to take climate seriously. Where we have tried before oil money in politics have thwarted us
4154 2018-11-17 22:06:06 Most of the 9/11 attackers were Saudi. Yet no hint of the possibility that US might attack Saudi Arabia. Too reliant on its oil? Better go for an apparently soft target like Afghanistan. Then Iraq. Two countries whose nationals were NOT involved in 9/11. Now Iran! Makes no sense
4155 2018-11-17 22:05:52 Wood Mackenzie currently estimate Australia's commercial reserves at 2.0 billion barrels of oil and condensate, and 49.5 trillion cubic feet of gas.I recall back in the 1970's how much oil was being capped but by all means dont let to people of Australia have it

4159 2018-11-17 22:05:18 Tharoor’s UN career can be summed up by his cover-up of Kojo Anan’s oil for food scandal that led to the US putting a halt to his becoming UN Secretary General.

4161 2018-11-17 22:04:55 Now if the fence had oil on it he would have not been able go climb it and fall off of it. I saw some of them on top of it swinging there legs arms with out holding on to it . That was not a safe thing to do . What do you think ?

4164 2018-11-17 22:04:27 We should bomb them and take their oil. Thats what we will have to do in the end anyway since you will never let us use our own resources.
4165 2018-11-17 22:04:24  I tried to take some kind of oil once while having a migraine...I opened the bottle and it reached out and slapped me in the face and I almost hurled on the spot! Whyyyyy's it gotta smell sooooo bad?!
4166 2018-11-17 22:04:22 Also tomorrow, @FairQuestions as we speak with Vivian Krause about continuing U.S. funding of anti oil sands groups in Canada. @GasBuddyDan also tomorrow on "emergency" to Canada posed by plunging Canadian oil price.
4167 2018-11-17 22:04:19 I mean its not like the sun isnt out near often enough and with enough strength in Canada to make it worth while and that the majority of canada's energy is hydro followed by natrual gas and the main purpose of the pipeline/refinery is to sell our oil.

4191 2018-11-17 22:01:01 Has is low, oil is cheaper. More people are saving money instead of going into debt for their desires. I was taught to avoid debt and taught my kids to save. 10/10/10 method. Savings, emergency and investment.
4192 2018-11-17 22:00:51 Be careful out there if you are selling cars-there's a scam going where 2 men turn up-foreign accents-very intimidating  late in the evening put oil in your exhaust and coolent expansion bottle and tell you head gasket gone- it's only worth scrap!

4202 2018-11-17 21:59:31 It would be nice if you could get someone to lay hands on you and pray, annoying you with oil..  Virtual anointing... Virtual hands... virtual hugs! Abba may the love and the power of Your Holy Spirit travel thru the atmosphere to bring peace and comfort! Thank You Father...
4203 2018-11-17 21:59:28 The oil sands are totally natural. In nature, light oil rises to near surface areas where BACTERIA in groundwater degrades the oil by consuming light end oil, leaving heavy oil.
Liberals would PAY to MANDATE a “clean-up” of nature’s mess as “ the right thing to do”. Salesmanship!
4204 2018-11-17 21:59:21 My block list is getting longer today.
Marmite is like the sludge you get from an oil change.
Vegemite is far superior - it is more like the fresh grease used to pack an axle bearing on a trailer. 
Totally different.
4205 2018-11-17 21:59:17 How quickly you forget the low gas prices in 2015 and 16 on Obama’s watch. Yes before that prices were high. But the only reason they are going down now is because Trump lied about the sanctions he was going to put on Iran. He didn’t, and Iran can still sell oil.
4206 2018-11-17 21:59:14 My mother was briefly involved in two pyramid schemes but I was only aware during the most one. Apparently she was selling snake oil several years ago kbdidbsj
4207 2018-11-17 21:59:06 And after we end our strategic relationship and the Saudi's cozy up to the Russian you would be the first of many assholes who would say @realDonaldTrump did this to gain favor with Putin. And jerk-off don't forget that OIL would sky-rocket Remember 1973 when we sided with Israel
4208 2018-11-17 21:58:20 Neurologist thought I might have it but decided it wasn't. The film Lorenzo's oil was about it. Wish the wee fella all the best
4209 2018-11-17 21:58:20  Just tidy up a bit, make sure all food items are stored away,  and if you have any peppermint oil, put a few drops around your place. They will scurry off asap.
4210 2018-11-17 21:58:13 #CaliforniaFires. @realDonaldTrump lectures Calif on Forest Management!? He lives in NY & knows nothing about Nature, except it's an opportunity to harvest wood & oil. Has T raked leaves or even walked in a forest? T couldn't respect US WW1 deaths bec it rained! Poor lying Donny!
4211 2018-11-17 21:58:08 I really don't think that many of then understand that the Oil belongs to the oil companies, the whisky to the distillery owners etc. etc it doesn't belong to 'Scotland'. I wonder if it's painful to be that stupid!
4212 2018-11-17 21:57:59 @sainsburys please could you let me know if the bread made in your in site bakeries are palm oil free? Thank you
4213 2018-11-17 21:57:59 Additionally they don’t deal in oil and fuel but properties and finance.
Your mortgage is most likely their money.
Nice of you to rent from us !!!

4215 2018-11-17 21:57:37 I use CeraVe and olive oil every night and use a toner and moisturizer in the mornings. I also do a face mask twice a week
4216 2018-11-17 21:57:28 That’s what really matters. We don’t have to dwell on the oil or any other
4217 2018-11-17 21:57:27 I grew up in GA. We all get effected by big oil and big pharma pollution so we all get effected, even TX.
4218 2018-11-17 21:57:23 If they want to take a true stand they should stop stocking other brands that do contain palm oil
4219 2018-11-17 21:57:21 As a natural brunette: shampoo, condition and dry. 

Going blonde: shampoo, dry, use plant extract toner for 1 hour, hop back in shower to condition, add oi milk and comb through, dry hair, oil ends of hair. 

...This is beginning to be a real process. 
4220 2018-11-17 21:57:20 @5star_tv movie blunders.  Wizard of Oz. Dorothy was holding the flowers all the time. They were behind Toto in the scene you showed. Also easy for Tin Man to swap axe from hand to hand. I’ll give you the oil can but seriously. Shame on you.
4221 2018-11-17 21:56:58 The Iceland advert really affected me. I was so naive to Palm Oil and what the affects have on the Orangutans. Heart breaking! Let's do this for them!! #PalmOilFree 
4222 2018-11-17 21:56:53 The guy doing my oil change is from East Cleveland and he’s giving me a discount!!! 
4223 2018-11-17 21:56:42 Bruh on god, I need the beard oil and comb through daily

4225 2018-11-17 21:56:32 Absolutely. It's been a problem starting at least in the industrustrial age. But buy clear cutting forests all over the world they are basically cutting out bits if the earth lungs. Look into illegal palm oil. Clear cutting rainforests...the acceleration has created more stress.
4226 2018-11-17 21:56:30 By the colour if the article I would assume it is from upstream oil news.  Which is a well renowned publication based in singapore.
4227 2018-11-17 21:56:25 So other than bio oil. What’s really good for scars ???
4228 2018-11-17 21:56:18 just got my oil changed for this Seaway Texas Weekend Road Trip with the girls 
4229 2018-11-17 21:56:15 Wouldn’t that just push Saudi Arabia away from partnership with US and more towards Russia? They might stop selling oil in usd. That’s a dream come true for our enemies.
4230 2018-11-17 21:56:12 Peppermint oil is supposed to help with headaches, not cause pain to your eyeballs, Mikey. Be careful.
4231 2018-11-17 21:56:04 We went to war in Iraq because he sold oil on the Euro. Threaten the status of the petrodollar you get bombed. What do the countries we have overthrown and the countries we are threatening to overthrow have in common?
4232 2018-11-17 21:55:55 Rule 1: NO OIL 
Look basically whatever u eat is healthy if u cook it in a healthy way 
Yes as simple as that! Dont use oil, avoid unhealthy condiments, eat more greens in ur meals thats what on my mind so far
4233 2018-11-17 21:55:53 Start with firm tofu...toast some garlic in a pan with olive oil (take off heat when garlic is the color of toast) . Now use the oil only (strain out the garlic) and pan fry the tofu. . .not great, but edible..

4236 2018-11-17 21:55:27 The 20 worst fires in California history have been in recent years. The Camp Fire the worst in terms of loss of life. Every year we continue to break records we don't want to break while the Republicans continue to deny science, climate change and give oil companies tax breaks.

4239 2018-11-17 21:55:17 Try hemp oil. Has a nice taste to it and no you won't get stoned.
4240 2018-11-17 21:55:16 That's embarrassing for NATO. That warship weighs 5500 tons & hit the oil tanker weighing 150,000 tons. You would think they would steer clear of it altogether. Jeez.
4241 2018-11-17 21:55:15 Where do you but them

Faulty thermostat the super said
4243 2018-11-17 21:54:58 I know my brother who’s fighting it now , sending off for the oil at one hundred pounds a time , if that was the cure they would have done it years ago , rip off merchants
4244 2018-11-17 21:54:54 They will find the men who actually did the deed and make them pay BUT everyone wants this countries oil so the prince will be deemed not guilty of ordering this terrible crime.
4245 2018-11-17 21:54:45 Is about time, oil is for something else
4246 2018-11-17 21:54:39 Ma'am, please explain FM Jaitley gleefully raising excise duty on fuel in 2015-16 whenever oil prices fell. How is it justified? Inflation is so high, haven't seen in 63 years.
4247 2018-11-17 21:54:36 I like it. Teach it to type, or does it speak?  Perhaps it could keep skunks and Opossums out of my yard, catch thieves red handed, do some of the gardening, and change my oil without jacking up the car, inspect things under the house, Oh I've got big plans for this little guy.
4248 2018-11-17 21:54:35 @damadigna Number 45 visited Cali wildfire region and thinks we should "rake the forest floor", should we mop the ocean too? Maybe that could help the oil spill problem, gmafb
4249 2018-11-17 21:54:30 Cut the world oil dependency by 50% and everything changes.

4254 2018-11-17 21:53:50 79 was the next oil embargo.  Tied in somewhat to the Iran Hostage debacle. Gas got to be around a dollar a gallon...
4255 2018-11-17 21:53:38 James Bond movies were a product of their time. In the 1960s it was amazing to see a car thwart pursuers by dropping oil slicks, emitting smoke, or dropping shards of jagged metal. But now any of this can be done with any 1998 Ford Escort
4256 2018-11-17 21:53:29 Strange facts about crying:
-Tears consist of three layers: oil, water, and mucus.
-There are three kinds of tears: Basal, Reflex, and Emotional tears.
-You’ll make fewer tears as you get older.
-Tears have the same composition as saliva.
-Shaikha cries 1 to 3 hours each day.
4257 2018-11-17 21:53:18 I’m barely able to get off my ass to get an oil change, let alone a whole airbag fix
4258 2018-11-17 21:53:17 Yes you are light years better than Harper but your commitment to continue with the oil economy kind of undoes all the good you are doing. Make the commitment to get off the pipe in the next ten years. Step up and we will follow you
4259 2018-11-17 21:53:05 would’ve been on the road but my dumb ass waited to the last min trying to get my oil change  & they booked
4260 2018-11-17 21:52:57 It is a combination. Oil was pretty important, now it's oil, the alliance with Israel and SA against Iran.

4263 2018-11-17 21:52:40 Oil price still at healthy levels tho. Collapse should stop here, given both technical and fundamental indicators.

4266 2018-11-17 21:52:32 i arrived @sararountree’s house tonight and when she opened the door the smell of sesame oil hit me in the face. “OPEN SESAME” literally. but sara didn’t laugh at the joke
4267 2018-11-17 21:52:32 I'd wrestle Maria any time... can we oil each other up and then wrestle?
4268 2018-11-17 21:52:29 What a waste that would’ve been of all the natural gas and oil that’s been discovered since then...
4269 2018-11-17 21:52:21 I know you’re all deeply shocked there’s a Mr Universe from Co. Wexford and it’s not me. I decided to give this bloke a chance. Plus, the only oil I can afford is in a tank in the garden. #RayDarcyShow
4270 2018-11-17 21:52:19 I hate going and getting oil changes by myself Bc i swear i think the mechanics think I’m dumb to try to talk me into spending more money and replacing things that don’t need replaced
4271 2018-11-17 21:52:16 If you came across someone beating a dog, and they went on a rant about how they don't buy palm oil because they care about animals, would you not tell them: "Hey, if you care about animals, it makes no sense to continue abusing dogs"?
4272 2018-11-17 21:52:11 Surely British teeth are worse. They were horrified mine weren't glistening like a oil slick when I was there.
4273 2018-11-17 21:51:50 oil executives sound the alarm because they are not getting millions in bonuses!   We need to think beyond oil.

4277 2018-11-17 21:51:40 It isn't about oil or arms imo. Trump does nothing for anyone unless it boosts his orange bottom line.
4278 2018-11-17 21:51:14 Ha ha ha ha Saudi 7% drop in oil price as a reward to Trump's unequivocal support of MbS' is just wishful thinking
4279 2018-11-17 21:51:07 At my place it was hella packed all the seats were sold out
4280 2018-11-17 21:51:00 I’m really don’t feel like getting up to get this oil change 
4281 2018-11-17 21:50:37 Sad LBJ was a disgrace. He stole the presidency. If you check his history there are some shady happenings. His dipping into the social security fund to fund his push to Viet Nam so Lady bird would get rich from her oil holdings. There was a voter fraud in there too (protected)
4282 2018-11-17 21:50:10 It was a joint effort, achieved w joint strategy. There were multiple fronts & deprivations achieved at one (Eg. Oil fields, ball bearing plant raids, England holding out vs The Blitz) drained them on others (Eg Eastern Front) & vice-versa. All allies sacrificed blood & treasure.

4288 2018-11-17 21:49:31 Remember the Alaskan Pipeline bringing oil to Texas? The pipeline itself almost guarantees that we will always be dependent on gasoline etc for it is a sustainable industry, Somebody will always pay to fill it because it sells higher at the other end.

4296 2018-11-17 21:48:13 I know Chimayo! And Cuba and the surrounding area.  I used to fish in the Holy Ghost creek!  Love that whole part of the state! It's so beautiful.  The only part of NM I'm not real fond of is Roswell, (oil country) & Albequerque (too big)
4297 2018-11-17 21:47:41 Trump does nothing unless it benifits him. So oil and arms sales is not the reason he's trying to defend this monster. All we'd have 2 do is follow the money. Nobody seems to bring up that MBS gave Ivanka $100,000,000.00 for her womens initiative "charity". Where'd the $$$ go?
4298 2018-11-17 21:47:07 come on sir you know better then that, its Never going to happen. The deal our Gov't made with them decades ago will Never be moved backwards & you know it. It's all about the Petro dollar & Oil so to think we'd step that back is living a pipe dream

4308 2018-11-17 21:45:34 Why are we still in Afghanistan?  Why are we still in Iraq?  Frack our own oil and let the middle east go.  Perpetual war is wrong.  These nations will go exactly down the trail we don't want them to as soon as we leave. no longer worth staying.

4312 2018-11-17 21:45:01 Medicare4all would solves gazillions of problems. Divesting from oil as China has would solve a lot of the rest.

4316 2018-11-17 21:44:30 ACT! Stop ALL arms & oil deals with the murderous Saudi regime. NOW.

Human rights MUST trump $$ or we are no better than them. & hold trump&kushner accountable!!!
4317 2018-11-17 21:44:18 If I’m cooking, we can go through 500gm (1 pound) lard in a week.  I’ll have to step up!
I used to throw out the oil after cooking bacon and eggs, but now I cook in lard and make sure none gets wasted, by pouring it onto the plate.

4321 2018-11-17 21:44:04 I am out of breath constantly because of the dirty air oil. I am only 130lbs soaking wet to. #sad
4322 2018-11-17 21:44:03 Although I disagree with your premise, even if it’s true, wouldn’t it be better to have solar power rather than coal and oil subsidies?
4323 2018-11-17 21:43:46 @Ticketmaster : your auto system sucks.Tried to say @EdmOilKings & it kept hearing all from Etta James to Disney on Ice. After many mins, it finally heard Oil Kings (it had trouble with the date, too)then proceeded to tell me that tix are only avail online. Then it hung up.Nice.
4324 2018-11-17 21:43:39 I'm not blaming the government or oil companies. I'm just stating the facts that us humans a messing up planet Earth and this is why the climate change is bad. Maybe you should look in the mirror twice before you say something that's sounds like putting the blame on someone else.
4325 2018-11-17 21:43:36 Much of the world is not reducing its dependence on carbon fuels. That is a lie. Demand for oil and natural gas is increasing globally. Wishing that were not true does not change this fact.
4326 2018-11-17 21:43:21 What does it matter as long as we get the oil?
4327 2018-11-17 21:43:18 Why are oil changes expensive. They are extremely easy to do 
4328 2018-11-17 21:43:08 Trump screwed the Saudis over an oil deal. 

To make up for it, he gave them Khashoggi in Turkey.

To make it up to Turkey, he's about to give them Gulen.

How many more will die to cover up Trump's mistake?

4329 2018-11-17 21:43:06 Right. Still living off oil like Saudi Arabia. No new global companies in last 30 years!
4330 2018-11-17 21:43:04 So your happy to destroy what’s left of the world? What about your kids and grandkids? Will they be happy! 97% of scientists are they wrong too! The coal miners and oil companies own research is that wrong?
4331 2018-11-17 21:43:00 We can enough domestic supply in Canada already so the pipelines you are alluding to would all lead to ports to be loaded on tankers just like this.

Oh and this was Canadian oil from Nfld in case you didn't know
4332 2018-11-17 21:42:51 Bcus they sold me a piece of shit lol basically the car shut off on me and Chevy was saying one thing and I took it to another mechanic guy and he was like the previous owner didn’t take care of it as far as oil changes and stuff so it fucked it up
4333 2018-11-17 21:42:42 #Saudis are our enemy’s and have been for years. Time to take the OIL.
4334 2018-11-17 21:42:04 Rupee value was affected by US China trade war, increasing price of crude oil in International market.
4335 2018-11-17 21:41:59 This part of why I love working in western Canada. Despite all its problems, the oil and gas industry has given us a huge amount of data to work with. Even after ~750K wells we still have unanswered questions - always work to be done.
4336 2018-11-17 21:41:56 Of course I hit a bump so hard that it crack my oil pan now I’m leaking oil! 
4337 2018-11-17 21:41:52 Obama is a Satanic Illuminati Witch--which is kinda cool actually! Abraham Lincoln hid a bunch of knives in his hat! ILLUMINATI! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4338 2018-11-17 21:41:49 Y’all I put oil on my scalp this morning my shit ate that within the quickness 
4339 2018-11-17 21:41:41 2" thick fried on one side in olive oil in cast iron, cut off bone, broiled on other with garlic butter and rosemary.  OMG
4340 2018-11-17 21:41:38 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
4341 2018-11-17 21:41:33 Rose water and jojoba oil 
4342 2018-11-17 21:41:27 Do we know if some African Palm oil comes from Costa Rico? They grow it there.
4343 2018-11-17 21:41:24 Damon grins. He has some special oil that will ensure Aegir's dreams later are very 'sweet' indeed, hehe.

It needs to be rubbed into the skin though. Damon hopes Aegir doesn't mind, as he pours some oil in his hands, and starts rubbing it onto Aegir's broad, muscular back.
4344 2018-11-17 21:41:15 I hope my mom willing to oil my hair for me before I go home, would so appreciate it!
4345 2018-11-17 21:41:07 I've never had the willpower to toss it in a blender. I've only ever put butter/coconut oil on the bottom of the mug and pour on top
4346 2018-11-17 21:41:07 @CadburyUK Please stop using palm oil in your products. We are responsible for the conservation of our planet and everything that lives here. No company, however profitable, has the right to destroy the habitat of another creature. #PalmOilFreeChristmas
4347 2018-11-17 21:40:49 BREAKING NEWS:
Oil license not renewable

Mr. President, Mohammadu Buhari has said that with effect from 2019, existing oil licensees will not be renewed by the Federal Government of Nigeria&its public corporations. @APCUKingdom @Mr_JAGs @JeSuisNaija @toluogunlesi @jeffphilips1

4351 2018-11-17 21:40:39 Cw personal body stuff, cbd
So I've had cbd oil and other cbd products suggested to me multiple times for my chronic back pain, and so i bought a CBD chocolate bar. It has helped make my pain really low, like lower than i have gotten it for months.
But it gives me diarrhea):

Or
Dough was too watery

And he/she most probably doesn't have the wrist technique tu "cut the dough"

4359 2018-11-17 21:40:07 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。
4360 2018-11-17 21:40:06 All I’ve had to eat so far today is fat hits from my oil pen
4361 2018-11-17 21:40:06 I’m buying you anointing oil for Christmas 
4362 2018-11-17 21:40:05 Pretty words which actually mean "We want all your oil".
4363 2018-11-17 21:40:03 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
4364 2018-11-17 21:39:56 Well I shall try it then. Have you tried coffee with butter in it? Coffee + butter + coconut oil + blender omfg yummm
4365 2018-11-17 21:39:55 a wise man once said that when The Donald starts whining, a sane person dreams about being a #Democrat
4366 2018-11-17 21:39:51 i bought an oil diffuser today. and now my room smells like grapefruit. i’m happy.
4367 2018-11-17 21:39:40 Wouldn't touch either. $SU, $IMO and $CNQ (maybe $KEY) are best for riding out dreadful Canadian oil/gas prices.  And $CCO - they needed an offshore $2B tax dodge just to look like a MEDIOCRE business. Misplaced sentiment on that one but kudos to those who made money in the run.
4368 2018-11-17 21:39:17 LOL
Next up, how to check the oil!
4369 2018-11-17 21:39:17 Great take my friend.
4370 2018-11-17 21:39:14 STATE BOUND!!!! WeBo wins 48-7 and is headed to Lucas Oil Friday!
4371 2018-11-17 21:39:06 Sure, because they’re not ALL scam artists...pick your poison. At least this one isn’t killing our economy & foreign policy like the last snake oil salesman!
4372 2018-11-17 21:39:05 What a load of tosh. Come on please. Your getting desperate now. food shortages no medicine even bringing cancer drugs in if we leave the Eu. What’s next femi the Eu army blockade around the uk  I better start stockpiling olive oil 
4373 2018-11-17 21:38:47 Just an #FYI, coconut oil as lube breaks down condoms. Have witnessed 2 unexpected pregnancies from it.
4374 2018-11-17 21:38:44 Today I begin my day with black coffee mixed with coconut oil  #Cheers #WakeUp #morningfix #PositiveVibes
4375 2018-11-17 21:38:27 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts sesame oil with 1 part rice vinegar and 1 part tahini. Add oregano and brown sugar to taste.
4376 2018-11-17 21:38:21 This one like 5ltr red oil cover pass
4377 2018-11-17 21:38:17 Anyone that’s finically stable wanna Venmo me and pay for my oil change. I need to take care of my car  in cases I one day have to live out of it.
4378 2018-11-17 21:38:02 Will Trump bring in sanctions or is everyone a happy bunny as long as oil flows and keeps them happy. Will he listen to the CIA or to the voices in his own head?
4379 2018-11-17 21:37:58 That's one way they put out oil rig fires
4380 2018-11-17 21:37:54 Im The Type Of GANGSTA who be in the house 24/7, Take care of home & Mositurize with Organic Coconut Oil. 

We can't relate.
4381 2018-11-17 21:37:52 @IcelandFoods I'm so proud of you. Shouting loudly about the Palm oil/fat devastation of the rain forests is so important. 

Well done, you've won Christmas already.
4382 2018-11-17 21:37:50 So sorry for your loss. I’d like to pray, that the LORD will pour His liquid love  all over u & those battling depression. We bind the spirit of heaviness & let the oil of gladness b released. We cancel the assignment of the enemy over your life. In Jesus’ name. Amen

4383 2018-11-17 21:37:48 Plan nak burn the midnight oil tapiiiiiiiii the oil burned me ahdhsjskssksk tertidur seh
4384 2018-11-17 21:37:42 Omg those are life savers especially if you put a couple eucalyptus oil drops in it #HeavenSent
4385 2018-11-17 21:37:11 I only like fresh hericot vert (French) green beans sautéed in olive oil with lemon zest & minced shallots. The traditional casserole is too mushy!
4386 2018-11-17 21:37:07 Seen that coconut oil is so beneficial for your skin so I’ve started using it daily. My skins never been worse 
4387 2018-11-17 21:36:59 To that Sewage Cover that busted my transmission oil pan, you cost me $500.

GUH SUKK YUH MUMMA. 
4388 2018-11-17 21:36:59 I feel like I wasted half of my day fooling with this oil change
4389 2018-11-17 21:36:57 how do we know KSA is short monstrous amounts of oil puts?
4390 2018-11-17 21:36:55 All about the oil so no chance
4391 2018-11-17 21:36:55 @servicealberta Manitoba has plates for firefighters...is it possible to get those here as well?
4392 2018-11-17 21:36:53 olive oil / balsamic tasting is the most next level shit I’ve done so far
4393 2018-11-17 21:36:42 Quebec already has pipelines from Alberta.  Irving buys most of their oil fro the US.  There is no Eastern Canadian market for WCS or bitumen since they can’t process it.
4394 2018-11-17 21:36:37 I don't make any excuse of a president trump. Hes not spit and  polished snake oil salesman like Obama,  he says it straight off the hip and to the point and he is keeping his campaign promises (despite the resistance from the out of control left)
4395 2018-11-17 21:36:35 A cleansing facial mask, earthy blue, with woad, neem oil, and exfoliating brown sugar. It smells strongly sweet.
4396 2018-11-17 21:36:34 one day I’ll be popping fish oil pills for my health
4397 2018-11-17 21:36:28 It's a whole thing.... People try to stop people from being suckered into the snake oil of astrology and they turn around any say "only SEXISTS don't believe planets are magic!"
4398 2018-11-17 21:36:17 Got a Revere P-90 projector. The guy thought it was 1941. Works well. Needed a little oil.
4399 2018-11-17 21:36:14 LSAT tip: take a bath in peppermint oil the night before the test. Studies prove the scent of peppermint improves test scores.
4400 2018-11-17 21:35:52 Or, better yet: put all the halves into a mixing bowl. Pour in olive oil, add salt, pepper. Give the whole bowl of sprouts a good mixing up with a big spoon. Lots of flakes will fall off the heads and get coated as well. Then lay them all out in pan. Produces extra crispy chips
4401 2018-11-17 21:35:31 Non oil producing just means xamar so just add them together. Basically we are being scammed.
4402 2018-11-17 21:35:20 I’m getting my oil changed and this woman in the waiting room with me is incessantly talking to her dog like it’s a human child.
4403 2018-11-17 21:35:12 Come for the condescension, stay for the pitching of the Dave Ramsey snake oil.
4404 2018-11-17 21:35:05 Today's menu:
여덟 house-made chili pepper bun rieu with teriyaki oil $38
다섯 traditional Korean-style daikon omelette with katsuobushi namul $198
4405 2018-11-17 21:35:02 I think it may have something to do with oil, sans dollars.
4406 2018-11-17 21:34:42 No oil involved
4407 2018-11-17 21:34:26 He's a snake oil salesman w/ enough vocab and university time baffle the uneducated with buzzwords and basic physics.
4408 2018-11-17 21:34:21  Use a mixture of Shea oil and  cinnamon oil- these will improve circulation and make the lips look brighter 
 Highlight the Cupid’s bow
4409 2018-11-17 21:34:03 We are currently selling our oil to the US for $14 per barrel and they are selling our oil at $50 a barrel. When is Canada going to wake up! Instead of refining our own we spend millions importing it from the Saudi’s while loosing billions on the world market.
4410 2018-11-17 21:34:01 The point is there are people and organizations that pour money into candidates. So that remark about the NRA giving out handies, could be said about AARP, big oil etc
4411 2018-11-17 21:33:31 Diane made me dinner last night of Pork Belly Bao with a sauce made of Soy Sauce, Honey, Mezclajete Especial and a drop of Sesame Oil, topped with diced Green Onion. 
Of course I had to use a line from Wash in Firefly. "Did she really make fresh bao?"
4412 2018-11-17 21:33:24 Why they are differenciating the federal gov and the non oil producing state? Does it mean that the 55% will stay in Xamar? I thought they would do redistribution.
The share of the federal gov is too big
4413 2018-11-17 21:33:19 Oregano oil and elderberry
4414 2018-11-17 21:33:18 I have watched hours of Jones's snake oil routine. A Best Buy Dr Strange, he has nothing constructive to suggest besides babbling on like Icke talking about reality all being a 3D quantum hologram.
4415 2018-11-17 21:33:18 Me entering Costco: “This is the worst of humanity.”

Me after 15 minutes in Costco: “Ma’am, please move your five year old daughter before I run over her fingers. I just bought 96 oz. of olive oil for 17 cents. These savings will not be contained.”
4416 2018-11-17 21:33:14 @tedcruz Just came by to see what snake oil you were sellin' today. Looks to be the same as usual.
4417 2018-11-17 21:33:11 There are no opposing but just narrow minded views. What does it mean the word carbs: a can of soft drink or a cup of brown rice? Lard and extra-virgin olive oil have the same biological effects? 100 g of beef has the same human & environmental health effects of 100 g of tofu?
4418 2018-11-17 21:33:10 How on earth can palm oil be under so many different names @Greenpeace
4419 2018-11-17 21:33:06 Yes ,this is apt, but some opinions are foolish, misleading and can't be accepted, they'll do more harm.
4420 2018-11-17 21:33:04 I walked in the door and the first thing dad said to me was "When's the last time you checked your oil?" 
Like yeah nice to see you too 
4421 2018-11-17 21:32:49 Oh pls this oil cleanser is causing me breakout or what? Penat la gini

4424 2018-11-17 21:32:38 @NutellaGlobal Please stop it with the palm oil. Look an orphaned orang in the eyes and ask yourselves if you’d like him to be the last. Thank you.
4425 2018-11-17 21:32:19 YA and also it doesn’t use oil so there’s no chance of me splashing myself in the face w burning hot oil like i normally do

4432 2018-11-17 21:31:49 ICE, Oil, Electrical utilities. If those three aren’t legacy industries I don’t know what is. Too early to say “obliterating” but that will come soon enough

You wish you were me.
4435 2018-11-17 21:31:38 For fans of peanut butter, Aldi have palm oil free version.
4436 2018-11-17 21:31:26 Palm oil!? What exactly is that for?
4437 2018-11-17 21:31:21 No, it’s necessity. Much of Europe needs to import oil and gas, they (like the Chinese) have a great need for alternative energy. They very heavily subsidized these alternatives. They are now cutting back on subsidies and building new coal-fired power plants.

4441 2018-11-17 21:31:07 @wingstop off of west colonial was horrible today.  I've been going to them for 5 years and never had a problem. I ordered the 30 dollar wing special and my food was in a pool of oil. I wanted a refund and they did not do so. Poor customer service today...
4442 2018-11-17 21:31:05 I have long wondered the same. Their oil can’t possibly be worth it.

4444 2018-11-17 21:30:52 @kenjilopezalt Should I rub oil on the turkey before applying the salt and baking powder, or after the dry-brine process is complete? How much salt for an 18-pound heritage bird? (I know it’s too big — my mom bought it!)
4445 2018-11-17 21:30:45 Every time I stir the oil into my natural peanut butter, I think of @momowelch's dumb tweet about how that constitutes a workout
4446 2018-11-17 21:30:41 Skin probs respond well to a little coconut oil added to food or massaged into skin. You could give it a till you get to vet and may not need to go. Oily fish in diet is also good. 
4447 2018-11-17 21:30:39 The data (from many different sources, of many different kinds) and the physics and chemistry underlying it is incontrovertible. The misinformation campaign started by the big oil companies has been sadly successful, but there is no doubt as to who is right.

4450 2018-11-17 21:29:57 Depends on area & depth.  Gassier to SW, more volatile oil to NE.
4451 2018-11-17 21:29:38 You got the free range organic oil change
4452 2018-11-17 21:29:24 Sorry, Ocasio-whatever, at the same time, has a dissertation on 50 years of middle east politics and policies, and the effect of Saudi and Iranian oil production on our economy.  Or, was it that she was figuring which toppings she wanted on her pizza. Same answer, either way.
4453 2018-11-17 21:29:16 I took my car to valvoline to get the oil changed & the boy changing it dropped my car in the hole. so now they have to call a tow truck to get it out & even though I haven’t spoken a word, I’ve been told to “calm down” atleast 3 times. 

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SATURDAY

4458 2018-11-17 21:28:51 Thought it was just me. They never work when I go for an oil change or something

4461 2018-11-17 21:28:15 No matter how much I felt the oil companies and Nigeria as a whole deprives the Niger-Delta, kidnapping and killings or blowing pipelines will never be a just cause and anyone who does it should be branded a terrorist to me

4464 2018-11-17 21:27:38 So far I've found their stuff to  be good quality and while a bit on the high side price wise... they *have* stuff. Tweed  ran out of the oil I need every day for nerve pain and complex PTSD. Broken Coast saved me from a lot of bad bad days. I'm grateful. ♡
4465 2018-11-17 21:27:38 I only eat variants. Not the original recipe filled with sugar and palm oil.

4470 2018-11-17 21:27:12 The only thing he is good for now is recruiting. He gets 4 and 5 star recruits and still can’t beat the Michigan’s, Mich states and OSU... let alone handily defeat a 1-10 team. Franklin is a snake oil salesmen who can’t game plan for the life of him. Moorehead mad psu great.

I try using coconut oil and water when I remember.
4472 2018-11-17 21:26:42 The quicker we jack in oil consumption the cleaner the air will be, the healthier we will all feel and be. The world will be a better place. It’s been poisoned for the last 100 years. And Shell.... you started it so bring it to an end.
4473 2018-11-17 21:26:36 But you're fine with droves of Central Americans coming in to compete with Americans for lower skill jobs and the lower wages that result from oversupply of this labor, in a world that is replacing them with automation.

4477 2018-11-17 21:26:21 You are correct, maybe not now. But in 2001, we ignored SA’s complicity because: oil.
4478 2018-11-17 21:26:13 So weed's legal but that's it. Edible oil maybe.

4482 2018-11-17 21:25:34 Trump is preempting the CIA report by basically exhonerating the Prince beforehand. Remember the sword dance Trump did in Saudi Arabia....and his bowing down to the Saudi Royal family...? Made me nauseous looking at it...Trump only bows to a very large  (oil) mountain of money...

4506 2018-11-17 21:21:18 Just barfed in a gas station parking lot and sat in the car for 4 hours and someone at target STILL had to stop me and tell me how good I smelled. Amber oil is real magic y’all.

4512 2018-11-17 21:21:02 Italy-Portugal 0-0 75'.
The team is now petering out after seeing frustrated all the football produced in 70 minutes.
Portugal had 3 chances cause Italy simply have no oil left in the tank, and it's missing to play on few who could have more stamina.

4516 2018-11-17 21:20:25 por que todo tiene que tener palm oil maldita sea
4517 2018-11-17 21:20:04 Not sure !!The reality is money lead our world and it doesn't matter where money coming from ,we are going to accept it. Oil is an important resource for US companies and Obama couldn't do anything while it was his worst partners . This case shows US limit with their power .
4518 2018-11-17 21:19:54 Majority of the oil sector is owned by private institution....likes of chevron, shell etc.... NNPC is the only govt onwed, and he wants to sell it.
4519 2018-11-17 21:19:45 I never believed that life in Africa is so spiritual until i saw a man eating bread with anointing oil......
4520 2018-11-17 21:19:35 I refuse to buy anything with palm oil in it. Be careful as some companies even cosmetics hide the use under different names.
4521 2018-11-17 21:19:08 There are a ton of theories about why: oil dependency, scared SA will quit petrodollar, Saudis buy lots of US debt, need strong SA to help middle east interests ... I've no idea how big/real any of these factors are. But it's long felt that SA holds whip hand,

4523 2018-11-17 21:19:03 The last game I saw with this group was PSU last year. I’m gonna need more fish oil in my diet to sustain this pace! 
4524 2018-11-17 21:18:59 Thank you that’s very interesting. My own experience of dairy is varied. I can’t drink coffee without cream (but love them combined),find cheese actively addictive but helpful adding variety on a carnivore diet. Ghee is useful for cooking and tastes good.  Coconut oil yuk. 
4525 2018-11-17 21:18:59 That is why the igbos put palm oil in their garri, you know they don't reli leave their garri for days before frying on like the yorubas that leaves it for days to achieve that sour taste and ferment well .. so has to by pass that harmful effect they add palmoil

4530 2018-11-17 21:18:29 Easy mate. Gram flour and enough water added to make a sort of pancake batter. Salt pepper mixed seeds bits of dried fruits. Table spoon oil in it. To be honest chuck what ever you like in em. Get yer beast frying pan hot and pour in like a pancake. Roughly 2 mins each side.
4531 2018-11-17 21:18:26 Lush has a few that don’t contain coconut oil! Also, if you didn’t already, detoxing before switching to natural deodorants is super helpful.
4532 2018-11-17 21:18:25 Try Brewers yeast, lethicin, olive oil and 4000 mg of vitamin C daily. Drink a couple of cups of bone broth daily, should help bulk up your muscles and give you more tone and strength.
4533 2018-11-17 21:17:51 Al drove out who quarantine the burning oil isn't well, maybe."
4534 2018-11-17 21:17:51 Maybe the oil and gas industry, that is massively subsidized by Canadians, could get its own act together and stop relying on government? The future is in renewables, anyway.

4538 2018-11-17 21:17:28 that. doesn't make then unvegan just not good for the environment I guess.... many vegans dont eat stuff with palm oil but the thing itself is still vegan? I think?

4540 2018-11-17 21:17:25 All the oil rejiggering is like a comedy to me, and I don't mean like a modern romantic comedy, or like a lighthearted Shakespearian comedy. No, I mean like a Bruce Campbell dark comedy, where everything goes bad and heads unironically roll, comedy.

These folks who blindly follow, are sleepwalking to all of our hell w evangelical colluding w oil barons for mass destruction. I blame the oily.
4544 2018-11-17 21:16:36 It's banned coz it speaks the truth, just like the one on palm oil, which the rich elite and corporations don't want the common man/woman to know because they just might turn on them. Let's do that, lets demand a GE and put Labour into Downing Street, you know it makes sense!!!
4545 2018-11-17 21:16:30 Lyn have you seen the palm oil and from Iceland that will bring a tear to your eyes so sad bless x
4546 2018-11-17 21:16:10 Do you see a difference in effectiveness between edible and pills, or oils you can consume straight? I can't actually take any edible or oil when I'm having a migraine because the smell makes me vom, but if I could find something not terrible to eat, I could try that sometimes.

4567 2018-11-17 21:13:25 As a tweeting chronic pain patient who uses cannabis (obtained from an LP), I’d be happy to join up. 2014 I was essentially bedridden from suspected inflammatory autoimmune muscle disorder. Started CBD Oil 2017 as last resort. My Doc’s are happy but stunned at my improvement.
4568 2018-11-17 21:13:17 Agreed. More people need to drive evs. Subsidize them not oil.
4569 2018-11-17 21:13:13 with 40% of Canadian oil going to the states at lower cost is the imports just political?
4570 2018-11-17 21:13:07 Here’s an idea! Stop sending them!

We only have one refinery here that is already supplied by the Trans Mountain. You can get to the US by heading south from Calgary, not West. And you’ll never get away with loading oil tankers out of here so..?
4571 2018-11-17 21:13:02 I’ve been saying countries are after Somalia because of the rich untapped resources. Mainly oil and uranium. Somalis better unite before 2020, or it could become like Libya
4572 2018-11-17 21:12:55 The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.” 1 Samuel 16:1

4575 2018-11-17 21:12:37 hmm sometimes, i have to be hit over the head. For instance oil and koch finance the rebel. I hate racism and see no need for media that spreads the lies and propaganda. I think we agree?...pretty sure...
4576 2018-11-17 21:12:30 Yes it does.  And I find dry skin results in your body producing excess sebum to counter dryness. Reason I use jojoba oil. I trick my skin into believing it already has enough sebum

Ok, he's dumb too.
4579 2018-11-17 21:12:21 Try this for brunch tomorrow? Slow-cook deboned beef rib with diced pan-fried green onions and a dash of diced tomatoes. Add olive oil. Serve on top of grilled sliced potatoes.
4580 2018-11-17 21:12:13 We need to stop subsidizing oil sands and pipelines. Full stop. Carbon tax is pointless with oil subsidies.
4581 2018-11-17 21:12:02 Overdependent on oil has slowed us. Let's diversify and Nigeria will face its real potentials. We need deep thinkers as leaders, not the present crop of crying babes.

Their whole budget was built on an oil price of $100a bl its $65 and was $30 ! You get more pp than the uk.

4589 2018-11-17 21:11:21 I think it’s because the fires and the water shortage are effects of climate change and the business class wants to suppress this reality in the same way that major oil spills, flammable well water and species collapse are no longer talked about. Bad 4 biz.

4592 2018-11-17 21:10:58 Huh.  I guess you're in old Standard Oil country.
4593 2018-11-17 21:10:57 Surely the viability of SMR's depends not only on the variability of fossil fuels (oil in this case) but also the cost of capital and the time to license a site. If the concept is one per mine...that is a lot of licensing each one takes 5 to 10 years.
4594 2018-11-17 21:10:55 YAY! I need to try the Argan Oil & Lavender! I recently just tried the Murumuru Butter and Rose. I LOVED IT. ^EP

Then again, last time I saw Kenny he was lying on a broken couch in a squat in a leather thong covered in Nutella and baby oil.
4601 2018-11-17 21:09:35 Imagine this guy asking for his oil back from jiffy lube.
4602 2018-11-17 21:09:33 Just got some oil paints, what should i make?
4603 2018-11-17 21:09:24 Oil Marketing
4604 2018-11-17 21:09:17 I can't recall the ratio of water to acv . But you're to use it as a toner after cleansing your skin.

I hate the smell so I wash it off with warm water after a few minutes and apply my jojoba oil and EO mix after.  This is where you may want a light moisturizer
4605 2018-11-17 21:09:16 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
4606 2018-11-17 21:09:15 Is this about right and wrong, or who controls gas and oil into Europe and shutting Russia Iran and Turkey out? Picking autocrats for profit has not gone well before.
4607 2018-11-17 21:09:10 Means probably haven't had an oil change in months

4618 2018-11-17 21:07:42 Everyone knows he ordered the assassination. They knew without the tapes. Plausible deniability if not for them. What happens to a prince who planned the murder of a reporter? Not a darn thing. Oil is gold. We'll keep selling them weapons to starve out Yemen. Bottom line first.
4619 2018-11-17 21:07:34 Watch how fast you and other politicians roll when Saudis call for oil embargoes 
4620 2018-11-17 21:07:33 "free education" if you don't get called up to active duty two years in because some non-christians won't give us their oil
4621 2018-11-17 21:07:29 Thank you. But that article does not reflect what was originally shared, but it has reinforced the fact we should indeed stop using palm oil.

4625 2018-11-17 21:07:07 Big oil doesn't by advertising to sell you their products, they buy advertising to ensure the media's silence.
4626 2018-11-17 21:06:55 Hey @crissles you need anything for tonight's show??? Water, tequila... essential oil?
4627 2018-11-17 21:06:49 Here: “Even if America doesn’t need Middle Eastern oil, its allies in Europe do, and China certainly does”...“This isn’t just altruism. In a world where over 40 percent of the S&P 500’s revenues come from outside the U.S., the American economy is dependent on the global economy.”
4628 2018-11-17 21:06:37 Today is a level 10 pain day. I braved my anxiety and ran to the store to get the final things for supper while I let super spouse sleep for work tonight. I grabbed a cake mix too. I need to scrounge for some mint oil or extract so I can make my chocolate mint cake.
4629 2018-11-17 21:05:40 My car is getting an oil change and a “software update” for the transmission...technology is weird! 
4630 2018-11-17 21:05:36 Honestly we don’t need to buy from anyone. We have plenty of our own oil. We just choose to buy elsewhere and save ours for when everyone else runs out. And I don’t need the media to poison me against Saudi Arabia. Any country that denies rights to women is not one I support.
4631 2018-11-17 21:05:18 oil & water.
4632 2018-11-17 21:05:16 My cousin teaching me how to do my own oil change on my car was the funniest/messiest thing ever

4634 2018-11-17 21:05:01 Yeah that’s what I was thinking. Extract the oil, feed the meal. Did the meal go well with the cows?
4635 2018-11-17 21:04:59 Is HEB now selling CBD oil to scan with that app? #accuracymatters
4636 2018-11-17 21:04:59 It's a tough environment in the oil and gas industry, but Holland's stainless steel #nameplates are manufactured to last.
4637 2018-11-17 21:04:54 i taught my kid how to hold a slice of pizza and how to dab the oil out 
4638 2018-11-17 21:04:42 Massaging coconut oil all over my body is always therapeutic.
4639 2018-11-17 21:04:33 Yes ! I’m not going to just sit  and listen to his fat Ass! I rather sit under a hairdryer with cooking oil on my head!
4640 2018-11-17 21:04:27 ((What I should be doing is my programming homework and my class project but what I'm probably gonna end up doing is finishing that oil solo.))
4641 2018-11-17 21:04:22 I’ve started taking hemp oil and it really helps so much and then use either a hot water bottle or a cold pad depending on the weather when I’m able to sit down.
4642 2018-11-17 21:04:19 Shut up @billmaher GDP NASDAQ/Dow, consumer index, housing market, oil production, ALL UP. Taxes gas unemployment food stamps-ALL DOWN. NAFTA/USMCA, Kavanaugh, Gorsich, Iran deal, ISIS, & UNHRC GONE. Jerusalem, no $ to Palestine.. running out of room all great things #Trump #MAGA
4643 2018-11-17 21:04:16 From our earlier discussion, this is disappointing. @AlbertaParty would be better served to remove the retirement to produce all oil from leases IMO.
4644 2018-11-17 21:03:49 I had a really nice talk with an older man while I got my oil changed and that was kinda cool 
4645 2018-11-17 21:03:46 Khashoggi's  murder. OIL, MONEY AND IRAN.
4646 2018-11-17 21:03:45 The real question should be: WHY are we still buying Saudi oil???Simple market economics would prove Alberta oil is drastically cheaper!HR’s violations aside, we’re paying more for a product we can supply to OURSELVES??? Who’s the dummy?
4647 2018-11-17 21:03:42 @BurtonsBiscuits v disappointed to see palm oil in cathedral City Crumbles ingredients. Won’t be buying again.
4648 2018-11-17 21:03:40 Its never for the U.S. He wants there oil

Took me 10 mins after to realise he meant alcohol .
4651 2018-11-17 21:03:17 I followed the instruction o.... My problem with it is the palm oil sauce(the smell, palm oil inside indomie, why?), the small chicken chunks and the sausage... For 350 is a no...
4652 2018-11-17 21:03:17 jasmine oil, my best friends face, jazz, creme tea, bumblebees
4653 2018-11-17 21:03:16 It's good to start your car at least once a week and drive it around a bit. :) Just to keep the oil flowing, make sure the battery keeps a charge, etc. Especially if there's been extreme weather changes. Better to get in a routine, then to suddenly go, "Oh shit, my car!" Haha~
4654 2018-11-17 21:03:07 Ima keep going. I gotta have a sip of oil tho
4655 2018-11-17 21:03:05 Made tomato stew without oil and I am loving it.
4656 2018-11-17 21:02:46 @DillanEngland crushed his oil filter 
4657 2018-11-17 21:02:45 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
4658 2018-11-17 21:02:40 $45 for an oil change $35 to fill my tank 
4659 2018-11-17 21:02:39 Also lots of castles harbours cathedrals and even Rome was built without power tools or oil, or electricity, I think we could manage, it’s time for the human race to evolve and the end of fossil fuels
4660 2018-11-17 21:02:30 Pennies compared to what they spent on subsidizing oil and pipelines.
4661 2018-11-17 21:02:25 Every parked vehicle is a green vehicle, leave them parked, but disconnect the batteries and remove oil and fuel first.
4662 2018-11-17 21:02:24 I think more publicity is needed to raise awareness of the impact soya beans have on rainforests and their wildlife. This seems to have been over shadowed by the impact palm oil has.
4663 2018-11-17 21:02:22 They'll probably be needin the oil considering Sherman's whole Scorched Earth Policy
4664 2018-11-17 21:02:08 Oil of oregano is safer and will help heal quicker than any antibiotic... Tastes like sh!t but it works wonders...
4665 2018-11-17 21:01:59 How most 25 year olds spend their birthday: drunk

How I’m spending my birthday:

- bottle of windshield fluid
4666 2018-11-17 21:01:58 It’s now or never to save #orangutans: key #palmoil vote happening to urge global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to insist that members like @Indofood commit to ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #RT16 #RSPO

4668 2018-11-17 21:01:36 Fotis - chocolate (that counts, right?)
Basil - potatoes with garlic cooked in the oven with olive oil
Martha - leek pie

Arthur - fried eggs and rice 
Father Yiannis - grilled octopus 
Alex - spaghetti with meat sauce
4669 2018-11-17 21:01:30 @BobbyJindal You’re not governor. In fact, you were always just a glorified oil lobbyist, always on the wrong side of history.
4670 2018-11-17 21:01:29 I love olive oil
4671 2018-11-17 21:01:28 It used to be cheaper than that way before oil was even discovered in Ghana.
4672 2018-11-17 21:01:26 Just a carpetbagger selling snake oil.

They create a huge amount of noise using religions and all this crap but really it’s all bout the MONEY, honey!!!!

4691 2018-11-17 20:58:56 Totally agree, we can push to make government do stuff to sort out Palm oil problem, but we can only ever completely control our own actions.
4692 2018-11-17 20:58:52 What about that man that killed his pregnant wife and TWO daughters and shoved them in oil tanks? Casey Anthony? The Skelton boys?? But yes let’s forbid people who don’t want kids from terminating a pregnancy. Great idea.

4709 2018-11-17 20:56:34 Palm oil is not really much needed ingredien in foods to begin with. For instance it's in a lot of peanut butter. I always grab peanut butter without palm oil. I believe palm oil is bad for you anyway
4710 2018-11-17 20:56:32 Acha acha salt oil bhi off kardo

4712 2018-11-17 20:56:09 Hi @TechDoctorUg the 1999 Toyota Altezza manual transmission faults cant be identified using a diagnostic computor. It should be physically inspected by a mechanic to check for  leaking oil, damaged gears, gear linkage, worn out or damaged clutch kit.
4713 2018-11-17 20:56:04 Cant we just harvest oil from space. instead of our own planet?
4714 2018-11-17 20:55:36 @Greenpeace I know all the PR against palm oil is good, but what is being done about deforestation on the rain forests for soya bean plantations? Just looking into it now, and it seems as bad.
4715 2018-11-17 20:55:31 @HeinzUK is there any defensible  reason your Farleys Rusks contain palm oil? Just bought our 1st pack - and our last, now I've noticed that in the ingredients list. Surely it's not essential, in a baby food of all things?!

It's hard to remove a stubborn stain, especially one that's deeply ingrained in dirt, oil and radioactivity.

4734 2018-11-17 20:53:15 Important to know. Is this mostly for oil or other items too?
4735 2018-11-17 20:53:13 Isn't it odd, the left wingers embrace the Castro brothers, Venezuelan dictators, El Salvadoran Communists, Russian/Chinese Communists and Iranian Mullah's. all with admiration. Do they hate OIL or the SAUDI Royal Family more?

4739 2018-11-17 20:52:22 Rex is the troglodyte sucking from the teat of big oil, if I am not mistaken. A corporate whore, a lackey, prostituting himself for personal benefit. A stooge for the tar sands.

4742 2018-11-17 20:51:50 What’s in the pack ? Oil , butter and onyx?
4743 2018-11-17 20:51:37 The irony of life?

Stupid Bush sent thousand of men and women in uniform to death for a fake war for oil. But moreover, he borrowed $1 trillion dollars to pay for the war. 

Who will repay the loan?

Who benefited financially from the war?

他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
4745 2018-11-17 20:51:10 5 minute stretch of the 3rd period aside that was an abominable performance from the flyers. They don’t deserve our patience. They’re not just about to turn a corner. Stop buying Hextalls and Hakstols and Charlie O’Connors snake oil. We’ve been watching the same season since 2013
4746 2018-11-17 20:51:04 Hubs insisted on 3 bags of cranberries, despite my efforts to describe just how much sauce that would make. But he changed the oil in my car this morning, so I'll make him whatever he wants. As long as I don't have to eat it.
4747 2018-11-17 20:50:57 These people do not have a clue about what just happened comparing to Sterling... Sterling had no one around... Matic's shooting foot was clipped just before shooting leading him to kick the grass. It's like comparing water to oil.
4748 2018-11-17 20:50:54 I'm sure there is a wonderful lady sporting eau de used engine oil and toting a torque wrench out there who goes for bearded hermits... 
4749 2018-11-17 20:50:49 NNPC is corruption Incorporated. Buhari is using it to enrich himself more than the oil communities.
4750 2018-11-17 20:50:44 Macron wants to declare War on Fossil Fuels......Let him stop importing Iranian Oil and give him the first Bicycle...........
4751 2018-11-17 20:50:42 Especially with the fully synthetic oil 
4752 2018-11-17 20:50:36 This is one major reason for a pipeline to a sea port. Our oil is not available to foreign buyers and the US refineries always work against our oil prices. Funny you never hear about dirty oil from California
4753 2018-11-17 20:50:33 Imagine having the audacity to open an Olive Oil store
4754 2018-11-17 20:50:31 Do you mean the oil embargo when gas about doubled in price?  Cause that happened in 73
4755 2018-11-17 20:50:04 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
4756 2018-11-17 20:49:43 24 Billion just in oil revenues alone during the PC Gov in power. A debt of 9 billion when took power and left us with 15 billion when done. I’d say Audit and do inquiry on  the whole 12 years they governed Not just Muskrat. Some shit be uncovered then I bet.
4757 2018-11-17 20:49:40 All we need is enough coastline to run pipelines to, while eastern Canada starts to wither because they get to start paying higher prices for our western oil
4758 2018-11-17 20:49:33 90% of the jobs they mention  are subcontracted or outsourced. Including those 3D geophysical geoscientific exploration scientists looking for new oil finds. Another social justice warrior BS ad to stay chill  with both nvestment in stockholder community.
4759 2018-11-17 20:49:06 Olive Oil:Les gilets jaunes ont gagné la bataille de l’image, la seule qui compte aujourd’hui.Les images des manifestants à 10 m de l’Elysee circulent en boucle sur les réseaux sociaux et Trump s’eclate à les regarder
Ce qui est jouissif c’est que ce soir la macronie est assiégée

4761 2018-11-17 20:49:03 I live close to the sea, lots of moisture in the air. My hair would put the Jackson 5 to shame without Argan oil
4762 2018-11-17 20:49:00 Да не, лично мне нравится)
4763 2018-11-17 20:48:57 I feel very productive i was able to wash my car inside and out wash my clothes finna get my oil changed fill my tank and air up my tires

The US can't risk that many oil and investments.
4765 2018-11-17 20:48:20 My bum in the first pic  u went from Olive Oil to Jessica Rabbit ok sis 
4766 2018-11-17 20:48:16 Callie assessed the damage. Broken valves, and oil pipes. She’s never seen an Android this close but she’s been trained in robotics for amputations this should be easy. 

“Would you like to come in?”
4767 2018-11-17 20:48:11 The waakye gari is always mixed with oil. You’re paying for the oil sis
4768 2018-11-17 20:48:02 That tosser Rees-Mogg only popped into Iceland so he could lecture the orangutan from the advert about why he thinks mass deforestation for palm oil is a good thing & that all environmentalists are v bad people indeed
4769 2018-11-17 20:48:00 Should also spray the fences with oil on a daily basis.
4770 2018-11-17 20:47:54 My Street burnt oil in in its first 6000 miles but I've put 44000 on it now and it doesn't use a drop.
4771 2018-11-17 20:47:40 Wood, biomass, wind and solar are feel good energy, do nothing to support the base load. NH was diversified, hydro, coal, gas , oil and wood all locally owned and operated. All have been sold off to private interests and/ or closed.  Check fuel mix and reserves at @isonewengland
4772 2018-11-17 20:47:31 I often rub olive oil on my lips in the morning and then carry around Bert's bees to use during the day. It's spendy but Laroche Posay Cicoplast cream helps when the chopping is really bad.
4773 2018-11-17 20:47:24 All the Climate Theory caused by CO2 is a big scam. It is of Marxist origin based on hate to capitalist business like oil, autos, etc and Masons have decided to profit from it by banning industries and introducing their own investments in impractical solutions like electric cars
4774 2018-11-17 20:47:24 Pro tip: use natural oil. Chapstick often tends to suck moisture out of your lips and make them dry out even more.
4775 2018-11-17 20:47:15 He could not deny, not her maddening plea for another nor his craven desire to paint her back like that of a fallen angel. The poison of her laughter had seeped into his mind like the oil of a wormwood tree, coloring the world around them in a devious haze. 

Yet his hand-
4776 2018-11-17 20:47:11 About 10 years ago I compared larger oil producing countries and asked a fellow analyst why USA hasn't bombed Libya yet. We were both puzzled, but I thought it to be just a matter of time. Is it the big picture in current case as well? Are Saudis and UAV just next?
4777 2018-11-17 20:47:04 I think @LindiweSisuluSA is a lot more geopolitically astute than most Western Corporate news imbibers. When ALL Western media outlets clamoir in unison abt “human rights” then it’s prob a regime change/destabilization operation, involving access to denial of access to gas/oil.
4778 2018-11-17 20:46:55 I burned the shit outta my arm with oil but man this is the best tofu I’ve probably ever made

4783 2018-11-17 20:46:25 Shonen & sexy are water & oil imo. Very easy for it to be pervy but being aimed at young boys who mostly just wanna see boob usually stop it going above that baseline.

4790 2018-11-17 20:46:05 aren't you that scum merchant for big oil?
4791 2018-11-17 20:46:03 well reducing your meat/dairy intake would be a start even if it's not possible for you to go completely vegan :), but also you could get your fruit & veg from local farmers markets and do research on cruel foods like palm oil so you can stay away from stuff tht contains palm oil
4792 2018-11-17 20:46:03 The waakye one has oil in it.

4804 2018-11-17 20:44:44 People who name their cars don't change the oil until it throws a rod
4805 2018-11-17 20:44:35 I been dealing with depression/anxiety since I was 16, I’m 38 now, what helps me now is CBD Oil since I don’t smoke weed any more  maybe you can look into that ...
4806 2018-11-17 20:44:13 Oh it's the snake oil saleman still selling lies to the British people. No offense Oklahoma but really? We are so fucked
4807 2018-11-17 20:44:10 2004 on are fine. Tend to burn about 1l of oil every 1000 miles but WTF? Nearly bought one but was out bid. No reported issues with the headstock.

4809 2018-11-17 20:44:03 Double standard!
4810 2018-11-17 20:43:53 It is really good.  Wouldn’t recommend it for tuna salad with mayonnaise or anything like that but I made the switch to tuna in olive oil and never looked back once!
4811 2018-11-17 20:43:52 @olbesancenot G'day, O.B., I don't see much concern from you and your lot, over French complicity in the Syria and Yemen genocides. You disgrace France by selling arms to camel scats to get your cheap oil. As does Australia. PSR, left, Australia. p.s.ravenscroft@gmail.com
4812 2018-11-17 20:43:49 I can’t get my oil filter off 
4813 2018-11-17 20:43:40 Getting my oil changed & they asked if a wanted a beer.... so now I’m drinking a Budweiser while I wait

4815 2018-11-17 20:43:31 Detta är bara början. Oil peak.
4816 2018-11-17 20:43:29 What are you trying to achieve . ?Oil free & acne free face ?
4817 2018-11-17 20:43:28 For some reason I always pictured you driving a Saab 93 with warm a/c and a minor oil leak
4818 2018-11-17 20:43:16 With current Canadian oil prices it’s time for Canada to wake up and do something about it. If Quebec and B.C. are not on board it’s time to stop their equalization payments and let them take the hit for suppressed oil prices.

4820 2018-11-17 20:43:12 Blair murdered a million people so he could nick some oil? Have you the first idea of how foil-hatted you sound?
4821 2018-11-17 20:43:09 Glancing to Fati, he noticed her hand reaching for the flame. .
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ “Jagi!” He sat down the oil he was holding and quickly grabbed her wrist, standing in front of her and staring down at her.

     “What were you doing?!” He questioned quickly.
4822 2018-11-17 20:43:06 No mystery. It’s b/c most of your colleagues don’t care about kids. Especially brown ones across the globe in a country most Americans couldn’t find on a map. They care about profiting from war, serving Saudi’s Arabia for oil, corporations and whatever else lines their pockets.
4823 2018-11-17 20:43:00 @BrettKissel  is singing out National Anthem #GreyCup at home city, Edmonton! 
I hope my Bombers get to be the team to be their for this! 
#LetsGoOilers 
- Oil Country in the Peg
4824 2018-11-17 20:42:49 So let me get this - there is a technology that allows Oil Companies to scrub CO2 out of the air to make oil, that puts more CO2 back in the air? 

Kill me now.
4825 2018-11-17 20:42:02 Lol nigga you installing ceiling fans? I mean I could build a shelve and change some oil
4826 2018-11-17 20:42:01 Wouldn't something covered in oil be oily and not wet with oil?
4827 2018-11-17 20:41:57 @Chena_Punim where do you usually buy your CBD oil?
4828 2018-11-17 20:41:49 @ReddawgHorizon so . . . If government is completely responsible for the success or failure of the oil industry, should they just take it over and keep all the money instead of just royalties?
4829 2018-11-17 20:41:42 The Magnolia oil can be found from Pep Stores... R20
4830 2018-11-17 20:41:40 American presidents going back to FDR have been forced to accept an alliance with that repugnant country; maybe this will give us the catalyst we need to break ties 

(Given that we don’t need their oil anymore)
4831 2018-11-17 20:41:40 Went in for a $50 oil change today to find out I also need to get 4 new tires put on for an additional $500 
4832 2018-11-17 20:41:31 Applications are open, may I remind you that Saudis drink oil for breakfast
4833 2018-11-17 20:41:29 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil

4837 2018-11-17 20:40:33 I LOVEEEE when they let u sit in the car while they do the oil change or tire change 
4838 2018-11-17 20:40:25 They say oil and water don't mix
4839 2018-11-17 20:40:25 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
4840 2018-11-17 20:40:08 Really? Them oil boys up to no good with that caffeine
4841 2018-11-17 20:40:06 今日午後からゲリラサラダ油来るらしいよ。
4842 2018-11-17 20:40:00 Please do not mansplain to me that I should “warm up my car”. My car is fuel injected. It does not have a carburetor. It doesn’t need to idle for any longer than it takes me to put on my seatbelt and pick out music. The oil heats up faster as I creep through town at 30 mph.
4843 2018-11-17 20:39:33 CANNABIS CURES!!!! as many of you know my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, as of today her tumor has shrunk and if everything goes well she will have on last round of chemo and be done!! i truly believe if it weren’t for cannabis oil she wouldn’t be here today.
4844 2018-11-17 20:39:27 I luv the fact that I don’t gotta pay for oil changes, I really need learn to do em myself it’s not that hard.
4845 2018-11-17 20:39:00 how do I know when I need an oil change? when my window washer fluid runs out
4846 2018-11-17 20:38:58 Certainly it’s much worse than it was in the 90s. I recall in 1996 a major Oil&Gas company had pipelines/Compressors stuck at the Port for over 9months becos they failed to grease the right palms. NAPIMS had to intervene to get it out. As a 51/49 venture Nigeria ends up paying!
4847 2018-11-17 20:38:52 They always try to finesse me when I get an oil change like I won’t call my daddy to see wtf going on
4848 2018-11-17 20:38:36 No oil needed.  Just stop showering.
4849 2018-11-17 20:38:26 As an older fellow (who does not believe in dividing up society in various ridiculous and fake generations), I also believe so. I've believe so since the 60s, and especially as a teenager during the oil crises, which were an excellent way to learn about energy savings, BTW. 2/
4850 2018-11-17 20:38:25 I was mixing my oil in with my moisturizer! 
4851 2018-11-17 20:38:20 I can watch YouTube though. *Shrug* I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't take so long to get an oil change
4852 2018-11-17 20:38:15 Make sure you have a good diet it can make a huge difference , If you can get some mag oil , It is topical magnesium it is great for anxiety and depression , It improves sleep quality and relaxation , Eat your greens for natural sources .
4853 2018-11-17 20:38:15 He's a plant for the oil companies
4854 2018-11-17 20:38:11 Oil change. Adulting at its finest 
4855 2018-11-17 20:38:03 These being your only gluten-free ones as well, some customers don't have much choice (except go elsewhere) even when supporting ban of palm oil.
4856 2018-11-17 20:37:55 Did you send a check?
The oil corporations did.
4857 2018-11-17 20:37:53 Heh - my Dad had a tenant (25 years ago) who drove into our yard one day and asked him to take a look at her car because it sounded funny. He checked the motor oil dipstick, and it was dry as a bone; asked when last she added oil, and she said "... oil? It takes oil?" 
4858 2018-11-17 20:37:48 Poorly maintained black cabs and private taxi oil smokers. Need the light house back in place. To voice the call of the Sirens
4859 2018-11-17 20:37:29 I reluctantly agree  #abgov must constrain #oil production. Don't like market interference but this resource belongs to #Albertans & govt is our TRUSTEE. They must act in all our best interests. Call an inquiry into why our oil price is so low? Manipulation? #abpoli #abenergy
4860 2018-11-17 20:37:21 good company samlying oil to de country
4861 2018-11-17 20:37:12 Not to mention the wildlife, flora and fauna incinerated. But Trump is still blaming forest management and not climate change. He is wedded to big oil and coal. He doesn't give a damn because he'll be dead soon. He's made a lot of people very angry.
4862 2018-11-17 20:36:56 Found my CBD oil in the fridge, it did absolutely nothing for me when I tried it. Maybe I should just chuck the lot in a cake ?
4863 2018-11-17 20:36:54 He wanted to cook for her, he’s just being a little cautious.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ After that part was finally done, Namjoon grabbed a large frying pan from the cub board and sat it on the stove, pouring a little bit of olive oil on it and letting it heat up.

      “Like it?”
4864 2018-11-17 20:36:53 Because the funds received from oil is squandered and misappropriated.
4865 2018-11-17 20:36:51 Tax cuts for rich, locking children in cages, cutting regulations so big oil companies can destroy the environment, alienation of our allies and embracing our enemies, inciting racism and hatred, ignoring the gun problem in the country and only offering thoughts and prayers.
4866 2018-11-17 20:36:30 The crowd was here a juiced up, students, alums, boosters, other fans who came in to watch #Baylor and the Bears leaked oil, blew a tire, hyperventilated and now must beat Texas Tech to become bowl eligible. As Doc Holliday once said, "it was too much for them to bear."
4867 2018-11-17 20:36:28 Of course the snake oil salesman is— GRIFTING & ROBBING USA blind 
Every. Single. Damn. Day. With. The. Complicit. GOP.

4870 2018-11-17 20:36:24 Farmaajo has to understand the state who’s water he’s taking oil out of won’t accept it. Farmaajo just wants to fund his war for centralization, and it won’t work.
4871 2018-11-17 20:36:23 JSThe French have been rioting right across France today being bludgeoned tear gassed and arrested because fuel has shot up astronomically.
They get no say Macron just sanctioned it for whatever globalist reasons he dreamed up, It's a cash grab for the EU not the oil states.

4874 2018-11-17 20:35:39 The Saudi oil is 20% from the world they can buy from others. I still love America and I know how your media wish your Brain. Anyway I don’t care what you think. The end, Saudi will do what they want and no one can stop her because she always in the right path. Love u so much 
4875 2018-11-17 20:35:38 I’m not advocating or volunteering, I’m pointing out that the human race survived for centuries before oil, but unfortunately by the time oil is used up this planet won’t habitable for any living creatures, it’s time for change, renewables are the way forward
4876 2018-11-17 20:35:25 Would u ever travel with the kids around the world if so come visit me in the Middle East . I have been watching y’all since u were giving birth to baby Jackson. Love from the Middle East ps is u guys like Kuwait it’s a contry with a shitt ton of oil money and NO TAX! Ly

Я: хм, позавчера прочитала главу, почему бы не порисовать Нулевой Эдем?
4879 2018-11-17 20:35:17 You are wrong. The oil companies already diversified into renewables and collecting tax payers money for environmental projects.

4881 2018-11-17 20:34:32 Will bring a Chinese an the oil for the feet x
4882 2018-11-17 20:34:31 Everything will be done at see and then it will be exported. So there will no control over those exploitations (if they discover oil).
4883 2018-11-17 20:34:21 من كثر ما بلاعيمي تعورني ودي ادهنها بـِbaby oil 
4884 2018-11-17 20:34:14 @pieminister 'sustainable palm oil'? no such thing. Pls commit to removing this from your ingredients. You just don't need it. #palmoilfree
4885 2018-11-17 20:34:12 #DumpTrump probably made a “deal” with the Prince that if he increased the supply of oil that would drop prices, Trump’s admin would go lighter on him. Why else are prices DROPPING when it’s getting colder all over? @CIA @FBI @StateDept @POTUS45 @CNNPolitics
4886 2018-11-17 20:34:10 My question was more in the line of: isn't the "we're not sure" often a disguise for "instead of taking snake oil, what you have to do to cure your ailment is to pray for the invisible spirit to do its work"?
4887 2018-11-17 20:34:05 Guys we can't get rid of Agwang. He's our main source of oil!
4888 2018-11-17 20:34:01 Clare, Banks & Algae - these three are more slimy than an Oil of Ulay factory.
4889 2018-11-17 20:34:01 Go to sleep wearing Lapis facial oil. You’ll wake up super moisturized. Look it up. And I use Khiels ultra facial cream.
4890 2018-11-17 20:34:00 Where the oil at
4891 2018-11-17 20:33:58 Try coconut oil.
4892 2018-11-17 20:33:31 （*＾ ワ ＾*）.... Did you eat my chili oil?
4893 2018-11-17 20:33:29 Pepermint oil from @younglivingeo
4894 2018-11-17 20:33:23 The country is one of the oil rich country in Africa,their GDP is high but the citizens are so poor and politically suppressed
4895 2018-11-17 20:33:17 Hmmm, pretty sure there isn’t an entry fee for the trails. The Government has to work on all things at once. Oil, trials, healthcare....
4896 2018-11-17 20:32:45 Hi Aimee, we don't have lists of our products that are made without palm oil. All of our bread is clearly labelled with ingredients. If you speak to our Food Hall staff next time you visit, they'll happily help you check. Thanks, Emma
4897 2018-11-17 20:32:42 Work 
Oil changed 
Nap .... 
4898 2018-11-17 20:32:34 It’s going to get worse which is why many ETFs are buying up water rights as it’s worth more than oil 
4899 2018-11-17 20:32:27 @ColinCarriere
4900 2018-11-17 20:32:22 I think I bought into coconut oil because everybody was swearing by coconut oil for the longest and I always felt like it didn't work for me but I kept trying lol when I switched up to argan oil it changed my life. My hair is not nearly as frizz prone and it's not heavy & greasy
4901 2018-11-17 20:32:10 Oil over gars, papers, woods, etc. This isn’t up for a debate.

4903 2018-11-17 20:32:00 @prayingmedic you should do a quick thread/post on snake oil just to troll Gorka.
4904 2018-11-17 20:31:59 Still sick af but adulting doesn’t stop. Currently getting an oil change and i have work at 4:30
4905 2018-11-17 20:31:53 Use shampoos & leave ins with argon oil, castor oil or coconut !!

4907 2018-11-17 20:31:31 If you’re serious about the environment and deforestation why not stop selling meat which caters for 90% more deforestation than palm oil does
4908 2018-11-17 20:31:29 oil makes me, and my car, run well
4909 2018-11-17 20:31:10 Process of getting an oil change. 
- Sits down to wait for change
*oil changer comes up to me with air filter*
Him: You really need a new air filter, it'll cost $59
Me: no.
Him: you really news one or your car will blow up in 30 seconds
Me: no.
*proceed to call my dad.*
4910 2018-11-17 20:30:38 I get an oil change they moved my seat my steering wheel changed my dash display and turned my lights from auto to off like bruh are you serious
4911 2018-11-17 20:30:34 Watch my YouTube tutorials ahhh . Jk I just mixed olive oil and sugar to exfoliate for like 10 min then rubbed some Vaseline on after 
4912 2018-11-17 20:30:34 #UNSCMUNC2018 LIVE INTERVIEW WITH EAST TIMOR : "I'm super pissed off right now." Says US "does not give a crap about self-determination." Ends with the comment : "I have a ton of oil and natural gas, just saying." US just trying to help.. SAD
4913 2018-11-17 20:30:33 I was at that meeting and appalled that Idaho gave them the forum for their snake oil salesmen pitch!
4914 2018-11-17 20:30:31 Thank you for the suggestion... I love fried chicken and considering my wife doesn't trust me (shes very wise) to fry things in oil, perhaps this is a better way to go (healthier too obviously)
4915 2018-11-17 20:30:30 Yes oo.... And when I have an important place to go to, I just apply coconut oil on the visible part of my body.. ( feet and arm) no time
4916 2018-11-17 20:30:27 This oil perfumes I have been hearing about, I should really try one out

4919 2018-11-17 20:30:11 @BradWall306  sir why can’t we peg our dollar to the same level as USA dollar it would make our oil worth more. When I was much younger our dollar was the same and for a while actually Canada’s dollar was $ 1.10 compared to USA dollar
4920 2018-11-17 20:29:51 Demola, you're a blessing and inspiration. May your oil never run dry, and your strength never pale.
4921 2018-11-17 20:29:45 These people have the world at ransome.  I cannot see why a third party should control the oil of the world, while everyone is dependent on it.
4922 2018-11-17 20:29:36 @nabisco Please pledge to stop using palm oil. Our planet and it's beautiful creatures are more important than your profits. You can make products without it. Can we count on you?
4923 2018-11-17 20:29:35 - change oil
- change brakes
- buy mas motavation
4924 2018-11-17 20:29:22 Firstly, Saudi Arabia was "created" by the British for the sole purpose of controlling the Wahhabis for the benefit of oil. Iran had a democratically elected govt which in '53 the CIA overthrew and installed the Shah - again for oil/resources. This has been the Western game plan.
4925 2018-11-17 20:29:11 I hate coconut oil
4926 2018-11-17 20:29:06 I think the guy doing my oil change is new. And my car only needs an oil change every 5000 miles or 6 months per the dealership... this place wants me to go in 3000 miles or 3 months. Think I’ll stick to the dealership even if it takes longer. And I think it’s cheaper..
4927 2018-11-17 20:28:57 More power to their elbow we are so feeble The price of oil per barrel has dropped significantly over the last few weeks yet noone not a refinery an outlet or the Government has called for a reduction at the pumps I wonder why? In the last 2 days in my area price is up 2p litre
4928 2018-11-17 20:28:53 delicata squash. split in half length wise, scoop out the inner membrane/seeds and discard. cut into 1/4 in slices, toss in olive oil/salt/pepper/minced garlic/thyme. roast on a pan at 375 or so until squash is tender.
4929 2018-11-17 20:28:50 I recall people blaming Obama for the BP oil spill and why didn’t he plug it up fast enough.

4932 2018-11-17 20:28:26 UK are reluctant bc they know that if they interven and the Southern Cameroon gains independence they will loose the oil deal that they have signed with La Republique to extract oil on our land
4933 2018-11-17 20:28:24 This peppermint essential oil is everything right now
4934 2018-11-17 20:28:14 You look like if shea butter and coconut oil came to life 
4935 2018-11-17 20:28:01 今後期待するしかないっすね
4936 2018-11-17 20:27:49 Tiny bit of oil.

4939 2018-11-17 20:27:15 The squeaking hinge gets the oil so just keep squeaking.
4940 2018-11-17 20:27:12 Omg try mixing peppermint oil with your shampoo, its like you're instantly teleported to Antarctica
4941 2018-11-17 20:27:03 ..of the oil firms and not seeing the challenges of green energy as something to be invested in.

4943 2018-11-17 20:26:33 @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden If you don't need America's supremacy on oil market, I need and I will determine Americans to impose you to achieve this goal.
4944 2018-11-17 20:26:30 It’s all about oil.
4945 2018-11-17 20:26:23 I was disappointed that the environmental measure didn't pass here in Washington State. Big oil muddied the waters.
4946 2018-11-17 20:26:12 The more coal and oil we burn.....
4947 2018-11-17 20:26:06 I don’t FIDDLE with bloody KNOBS, Julian!! My job is very complicated and complex! Now, oil up my pecs, we’re about to go on!
4948 2018-11-17 20:25:43 LOL @ the asterisks 
It’s an oil. Use it last.
4949 2018-11-17 20:25:40 Did you oil that pan?
4950 2018-11-17 20:25:39 The oil execs currently murdering the planet know exactly what they're doing they just don't care because they'll die in their sleep by before shit truly hits the fan
4951 2018-11-17 20:25:21 Erdogan of Turkey, the man that allowed ISIS to cross the border for hospital stays, for food for oil sales and who killed kurds regularly, is NOT our friend @potus @realDonaldTrump
4952 2018-11-17 20:25:10 @JoogSquad hey, I was wondering what are your thoughts and palm oil and the crisis about it. It wohld be nice if you could make this more popular as you can reach out to a broader community. Thank you anyway
4953 2018-11-17 20:25:06 4 hours just to get an oil change and spark plugs smh. Threw off my whole damn morning cuhh
4954 2018-11-17 20:25:05 Yeah that’s still basically a taper though, plus I’ve only ever seem them in acrylic?? So porous n clings to the skin even with oil
4955 2018-11-17 20:25:01 Forget the phrase “Beware of Greeks baring gifts”...Beware of racist New York slum lords/ snake oil salesmen baring offers of “support” fo Pelosi!
Ms. Pelosi doesn’t NEED help from that D-Bag 
4956 2018-11-17 20:24:57 Me personally i have waves my hair naturally grows like that but i don’t all of that lol. I be tired as hell from work i don’t have the time. I just wash and put a little coconut oil in it at night that’s about it.
4957 2018-11-17 20:24:40 Furthermore Saudi China Oil for Yuan might have a tad to do with the sudden admissions.
4958 2018-11-17 20:24:32 Gillum is a snake oil salesman. His true calling.
4959 2018-11-17 20:24:27 @Fox78 I understand but u know how these things go.. we need news & oil price just drop gas 10 cents cheaper where I am & that before points
4960 2018-11-17 20:24:25 Lol how's oil doing there ol' buddy ol' pal?
4961 2018-11-17 20:24:05 Chop seven grams of olive oil and take off heat.
4962 2018-11-17 20:23:57 Reasonably well!!! What stone have you been hiding under.Or if you see what the Telegraph is saying about oil,maybe it's working "reasonably well" for the English wasting our oil revenues again
4963 2018-11-17 20:23:32 Go with what's proven.
Copper has been here for ages and will never grow old, it's jus the oil companies constantly replacing STAPLE materials that we all use. Can't for the PEX TOILET
4964 2018-11-17 20:23:21 Eastern Canada all butt hurt over American milk being sold in Canada, hurting Canadian farmers, all while burning middle eastern oil instead of Canadian oil.

4965 2018-11-17 20:23:04 Politicians who promise comprehensive yet simple cure-alls are selling snake oil, and should be treated as such.

4967 2018-11-17 20:22:47 Pro Tip - How to avoid being an Energy tourist pigeon:

Spend zero time on company or play specific Breakevens. Spend extra time avoiding national Oil Corp “Breakeven” rhetoric
4968 2018-11-17 20:22:42 Mars bar will be extinct if we get a no deal brexit.  More  scaremongering by the clowns running this country although less rainforests destroyed for palm oil! #NoPalmOilChristmas

4971 2018-11-17 20:22:29 Same argument was used to explain why oil would never fall below 100. Building costs come down quick when there is no bid.
4972 2018-11-17 20:22:27 BC blockaded Alberta oil, so we blockade BC fruit.
4973 2018-11-17 20:22:21 Me looking at oil at the gas station; a thread.Male clerk says “you need help finding what you need?” “Nope just deciding on brand thanks!” “Well I use blah blah in my car” “my car takes 5W-30 thnks” “you maybe could call to see what type your car takes?””I know which oil I need”

4978 2018-11-17 20:21:43 @stephmarch @StephaniesDish wondering if you have some advice for  day. My daughter recently found out she cannot have dairy. Is it possible to use olive oil instead of butter on the outside of the turkey? Should I use cheesecloth to keep it moist?

4997 2018-11-17 20:19:54 In the middle of first oil change ever without help of parent I had a moment of panic where I thought i forgot my wallet at home. I didn’t. It was at the bottom of my purse but my hands are still shaking 5 minutes later. geez

4999 2018-11-17 20:19:39 I’m really just salty because the money I had planned to spend this weekend is currently going toward an oil change and tire rotation . Shop away my friend
5000 2018-11-17 20:19:38 They are talking about it. Yessir. Also worth nothing the track repairs are being done to a 'can haul oil' standard. =-)
5001 2018-11-17 20:19:33 How about we stop powering things with oil?
5002 2018-11-17 20:19:25 Actually, you can. California oil much higher in carbon, for example.
5003 2018-11-17 20:19:13 It’s cold out and we can’t have those scalps dry. Come and get your hot oil treatments from yours truly.

5008 2018-11-17 20:18:42 We need a logical balanced approach to dealing with climate change. The oil industry can certainly improve standards of practice, but agriculture and lumber are in my mind a bigger threat to climate change. We can’t just address C02 output and not our impacts on C02 absorption.
5009 2018-11-17 20:18:39 Got my oil changed and they like “oh your throttle body needs to be cleaned it’s $120. They stupid ass thought because I was a girl I was gone tell them to do it. Bitch please I got a whole father that’s gone do it fo free.
5010 2018-11-17 20:18:33 I don't see why we have any dealing with Saudi Arabia full stop. If we want to trade oil, then let's do it but end all the other political entanglements with them.
5011 2018-11-17 20:18:20 Those blaming the rate of poverty on oil price or the past 16years, how market? 
The emergence of Atiku is already shaking their tables as Rice subsidy has now surfaced.

5020 2018-11-17 20:17:36 my skin does not wsnt to cooperate. i cant put oil or the usual white cream moisturizer or it gets horribly oily and tacky but then i boight an expensive light serum to see if it worked and its worse

I hate that shit
5022 2018-11-17 20:17:36 OMG, That and the smell of old engine oil...
5023 2018-11-17 20:17:31 and really, do the same for every other basic human right.

we're trying to do that with heating in the NE, how much should someone pay to have the heat on through the winter. for someone on oil heat & fixed income, they can end up paying around 20% of their income on heat.
5024 2018-11-17 20:17:31 mexico exports an estimated 40 bill worth in drug money into the US, that’s more money than their oil exports into the US..
5025 2018-11-17 20:17:23 Bitch gotta get the oil filter out, the fuel filter, the air filter out and there ain’t much space also i be bs lmao

5031 2018-11-17 20:16:39 Auto Zone tends to not have the right kind of coolant for my Mercedes-Benz, while O'Reilly does. Auto Zone gets parts wrong a lot in their system too. Either one is fine for oil and filters. Everything else I like to go with Autohaus AZ because they specialize in Mercedes parts.
5032 2018-11-17 20:16:19 put some oil + seasoning should be ok I think
5033 2018-11-17 20:16:15 Tonight, @OilCapsHockey vs. OCN Blizzard at the Tundra in Virden...GO OIL CAPS GO!!!!!!!
5034 2018-11-17 20:16:10 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
5035 2018-11-17 20:15:49 Remember coating the soles in Mars Oil Newts??
5036 2018-11-17 20:15:47 it's not like I like your oil and natural resources or anything, b-baka !
5037 2018-11-17 20:15:47 Thought fish oil had shut on long row?
5038 2018-11-17 20:15:47 A ‘freak issue’ allegedly during oil change. No oil light when delivered back but crank knocking after 3 miles :) hey ho.
5039 2018-11-17 20:15:47 You are a snake oil salesman.  Until the IEA discloses which shady right wing billionaires fund it, everythng you say is completely tainted.
5040 2018-11-17 20:15:46 #libya tonight 550,000children need assistance 550 schools destroyed 315,000 need clean drinking water a country of just 6million and oil wealth
5041 2018-11-17 20:15:45 Valid question by the way, but in my view it is too simple to blame only the actual oil infrastructure companies.
5042 2018-11-17 20:15:39 Thou anointest  our head with oil
5043 2018-11-17 20:15:29 Acha magr chocolates me oil kab se aya 
5044 2018-11-17 20:15:26 Staying in my car during an oil change gives me anxiety. Idk why. I just hear them talking and stuff and feel my car moving around and it just makes me anxious.
5045 2018-11-17 20:15:17 I think that’s a bottle of CBD oil.
5046 2018-11-17 20:15:13 Alberta give rebates to people from the oil industry royalties. So you are not telling the truth then??
5047 2018-11-17 20:14:49 Things that need to be changed on my car  new clutch, new tiers, and oil change RIP 
5048 2018-11-17 20:14:49 #Americans #terrorism is not the threat,more people did suicide, car accidents ,accidents at home,gun crime, you have been played, !wake up,and any small amount terror is because of your govt quest for oil,gas,and wars against others,
5049 2018-11-17 20:14:40 He will not be changed and we cannot simply cut ties with Saudi. A secure supply of oil is a matter of national security for us. We also have a base over there. I’m a pragmatist. As much as I would love justice for Jamal, the reality is there won’t be.
5050 2018-11-17 20:14:22 Can’t go wrong with coconut oil 
5051 2018-11-17 20:14:07 Here’s what we need at our food bank (St Ann’s on Gerrard): feminine hygiene products (esp. pads), diapers, wipes, soup, cooking oil.
5052 2018-11-17 20:14:06 @CBCNews What's the word on the oil spill on the east coast. 
Your news channel is strangely quiet about that story....
5053 2018-11-17 20:13:33 Have a video coming night on oil shortly.  I filmed it yesterday, but my phone started having problems which I got fixed today.  Should be up by tonight.
5054 2018-11-17 20:13:19 The video should explain the alternative methods to produce palm oil. Otherwise it just sounds kinda preachy
5055 2018-11-17 20:13:15 It's incredible how so many products have Palm Oil. 
5056 2018-11-17 20:12:48 Invade an Alien homeworld for Space oil when?
5057 2018-11-17 20:12:43 Depending on what I’m cooking. And who it’s for... I’ve cooked in underwear for my significant other before, but I had on an apron. NEVER bare when dealing with oil or grits.
5058 2018-11-17 20:12:35 @DonaldNorcross Please support the @sunrisemvmt /@Ocasio2018 Resolution for the Select Climate Committee. I don't want my house in district 1 to become beachfront property.  Theres an oil refinery in town so I dont think it will be safe to swim.
5059 2018-11-17 20:12:14 Haha we got a long wait ahead of us!
5060 2018-11-17 20:12:11 A coworker just had a panic attack and our supervisor just said, “Calm down.” If you’re reading this, please stop gas lighting people with mental health issues. I handed him my lavender oil and gave him a hug, it’s so unfortunate that it went down that way.
5061 2018-11-17 20:11:50 @gmbutts @JustinTrudeau I don't think Western Canada has any influence over any actions the Canadian Government takes, The majority in Eastern Canada decide the fate of ALberta oil. We are still drawers of water and hewers of wood to Eastern elites.
5062 2018-11-17 20:11:50 @bnrealwithu which registry office will you be at Monday morning? Maybe I’ll see you there
5063 2018-11-17 20:11:35 They have had our nuts in a vice for years with oil issues. You are very right on 9-11 and I think they knew also of those events.  Should have sent their rag headed asses to hell then, we did not. We attacked all the bastards around them instead
5064 2018-11-17 20:11:22 Following U becuz I like 2 watch people talk n circles.  Change what they say 2 fit their narrative & watch the sheep blindly follow. 4 some reason, I honestly believe this is a parody account. Either that, or a Snake Oil Salesmen pens this.  Do people really believe this crap?
5065 2018-11-17 20:11:22 There is no need, and further no basis, on which to call these treatments "snake oil". Especially without having even WATCHED the documentary.
5066 2018-11-17 20:11:17 Only if u are willing to wait in line with me!
5067 2018-11-17 20:11:15 viens chez oil
5068 2018-11-17 20:11:14 We were smoking oil dipped backwoods in the club last night with bottle service 
5069 2018-11-17 20:11:00 Tad bit’a irritation on the day.. where’s my oil pen 
5070 2018-11-17 20:10:59 Read it. I have one question, could it be that the drop in the oil prices happened because Trump asked OPEC aka Saudi Arabia to do so because of Midterms which Saudis initially refused? However at the beginning of October we had the Khashoggi scandal & the prices started to drop.
5071 2018-11-17 20:10:58 my mom uses coconut oil for everything she literally swears by it so I really recommend it!!
5072 2018-11-17 20:10:51 Wallahy allah suma gobe allah suka sama kamar Mu 
5073 2018-11-17 20:10:50 Canada must declare a "national fuel oil economic emergency" following postponement of Keystone &Trans Mountain Pipelines and drop in current heavy crude oil price with provision for overriding any delay in production or transport of Alberta oil due to environmental/other reasons
5074 2018-11-17 20:10:45 2 years ago we had the fire nobody heard about. Close to 300,000 acres burned across 5 counties in 2 days. The result was better grass after the fire. Nature benefitted, some people, not so much.
5075 2018-11-17 20:10:37 Oil oiii
5076 2018-11-17 20:10:26 @jonnytwentyone you getting one?
5077 2018-11-17 20:10:26 Terrible,horrible nonsense..wasted my time and engery..stupid dried fish and palm oil they used to fry all d fishes in the sea..
5078 2018-11-17 20:10:23 It's now they know how to report, while they were in captivity no outcry 
5079 2018-11-17 20:10:19 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
5080 2018-11-17 20:10:18 You know you’ve entered the adult life when you get excited about things like getting an oil change 
5081 2018-11-17 20:10:17 All are fabulous but if I had to pick it would be LIFE & Oil & Water
5082 2018-11-17 20:10:14 Very sad #TheScotsman Newspaper may be No More.  Well it's never got any pictures in it anyway, except Edinburgh Castle, or a boring Lone Piper, or a North Sea Oil Rig, pretending it's from Leith, when everyone knows it's just off Aberdeen, and they're just jealous.
5083 2018-11-17 20:10:04 Your wcw portrays herself as a natural hair guru.. she used cantu oil products.
5084 2018-11-17 20:10:03 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
5085 2018-11-17 20:09:52 @trisbey let’s do this!!
5086 2018-11-17 20:09:43 I was there yesterday. Coffee, popcorn, cooking oil and pop. But someone needs to be going through a lot of food, or have a large freezer to use it as primary grocery shopping
5087 2018-11-17 20:09:28 そういや今日でラスクエ丸三年でした。あんやーながいねー。ちょっと昔のチェキとか見ちゃう早朝
5088 2018-11-17 20:09:28 A bloke who had a shitload of oil but didn’t know what to do with it...... 
5089 2018-11-17 20:09:21 Distill some urushiol oil from poison sumac, poison oak, or poison ivy.
5090 2018-11-17 20:09:15 You couldn’t even back yourself in your fight with small small oil, you wanna take ME on
5091 2018-11-17 20:09:12 Solid pickup. Far better 3B than SS with some pop and will certainly be able to spot Correa and Bregman the odd day off in the field or a short-term fill in due to injury.
5092 2018-11-17 20:08:56 Very stupid people, they didn't cover the news of abduction, no outrage , no outcry no nothing.
5093 2018-11-17 20:08:49 apply aloe vera several times a day (massage into eyebrows till absorbed) 

apply castor oil with a cotton swab with night 

use egg yolk on twice a week(separate yolk from white, beat yolk till its smooth then apply into brows and keep on for 20mins then rinse
5094 2018-11-17 20:08:45 She is a scumbag worse then Agent Donald. At least the Donald doesn’t have to hide it as opposed to her pretending or trying to make people feel bad about her situation when she is in it as much as the snake oil salesmen
5095 2018-11-17 20:08:33 Dangerous Mix. 1) Slow pace of reform in muslim societies, includes jewish hate and Saudi Wahabis. 2) Shia-Sunni(Iran-Saudi) tussle in middle east. 3). US ill-advised( cruel) invasions of muslim countries due to cold war, now oil. 4) Israeli US lobby. 5) fast globalization

5097 2018-11-17 20:08:32 So @Delta managed to handle my luggage in a way that my tea tree oil that I use for wound care EXPLODED all over my luggage.  I’ve traveled with this bottle over 100 times with no issues. Thankfully it wasn’t full so hopefully the laundry bill won’t be more than $100. #fail
5098 2018-11-17 20:08:28 Brussels sprouts roasted in the oven with olive oil and smoked paprika are my fa-vou-rite snack 
5099 2018-11-17 20:08:14 Just a friendly reminder to douse yourself in coconut oil, Shea butter, Jamaican black castor oil, or whatever natural product necessary to keep that skin luscious! Support black businesses! Ok! Love you! 
5100 2018-11-17 20:08:02 The only measure of whether a storm or fire is more "destructive," better or worse than any other is its impact on people. Pack in more people, the self management of the system may not be people friendly. Interests of people and nature not always compatible
5101 2018-11-17 20:07:59 Oil changed and air in my tires. No orange lights on my dash cures my anxiety lol

5104 2018-11-17 20:07:26 this Oil Change Bet NOT take LONG 
5105 2018-11-17 20:07:15 4:46 (1st) - @nychds is cooking with peanut oil. That off balance layup gives him 16 for the half, Winthrop leads 26-24.
5106 2018-11-17 20:07:12 No but the oil output will reach a mini peak in 2021 and this will coincide with the new EU trade deal so people can make a rational choice. If you are fixed on another referendum you have to get the timing right.

The economics will never look right for indy in my view.
5107 2018-11-17 20:07:08 i’m going to try rosehip oil.. I’ve been using tea tree oil and it does help, but they’re so red it’s annoying
5108 2018-11-17 20:07:07 Yep. Climate change caused increase in droughts. But big oil stopped it (including Saudi influence)
5109 2018-11-17 20:07:02 What y’all know bout that black seed oil?
5110 2018-11-17 20:06:33 @AldiUK i have this little problem & i dont know what to do? whilst doing a “palm oil free shop” i found the product in pastry, bread & mince pies too! with icelands recent pledge the ball has started rolling,  i was wondering if you would be so kind to make same pledge too?
5111 2018-11-17 20:06:23 I got an oil changed in crowley and they vacuumed out my car put air in my tires and washed all my windows. Fuck that tire shop out south I ain’t never going back. 
5112 2018-11-17 20:06:14 You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room....
#MayaAngelou
5113 2018-11-17 20:06:13 What did you used to use before palm oil. The flavour of Cadbury’s chocolate has changed for the worse. Is it because you use palm oil instead of sunflower oil?
5114 2018-11-17 20:06:06 Apply coconut oil, almond oil and olive oil everyday (either separately or mixed together) keep on for desired amount of time then wash off. 

use onion juice on every alternative day(chop onion and use the juice with a cotton swab keep on for an hour then wash off)
5115 2018-11-17 20:05:56 Groundnut oil
5116 2018-11-17 20:05:22 It's somewhat less money & oil and more Iran that is the concern. Saudi is the counterweight in the region to Iran.
5117 2018-11-17 20:04:43 If you say so. Seems like a cover up to me. But doesn’t make any difference either way. As long as the US insists on buying foreign oil, we won’t go after Saudi Arabia for anything.
5118 2018-11-17 20:04:40 You know us f*gs don’t talk to our neighbors. My neighbor in a hoodie and shades just walked up no words to me while I’m changing the oil on all the cars and. Bends down and just says. Hey I’ve been meaning to say hey, I’m your neighbor nice to meet you, shakes my hand and leaves
5119 2018-11-17 20:04:36 I KEEP THAT MUTHAFUCKIN TH..coconut oil by my bed
5120 2018-11-17 20:04:33 The Oreo recipe contains palm oil from supplied by a company called Wilmar. Wilmar are responsible for huge deforestation in Indonesia. You buy Oreo’s - you unwittingly contribute
5121 2018-11-17 20:04:13 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.
成功の秘訣？ 早起きすること、遅くまで働くこと、油田を掘り当てることさ。

5125 2018-11-17 20:03:29 From unfunded liabilities in coal to pitifully small bonding requirements for oil and gas, we need to root out all of the ways that the fossil fuel industry has rigged the system, and remove that cancerous corruption wherever it exists.
5126 2018-11-17 20:03:29 Influenciou sim. O setor de oil subiu como um todo, ontem.
5127 2018-11-17 20:03:28 20th c. geopolitics all comes back to oil, since that’s really the only natural resource with which Russia can compete on the world stage 
5128 2018-11-17 20:03:06 Okay but I'm in this tea room and this lady at the table across from us has a whole CBD oil bottle sitting on the table and that's the most Carmel thing I have ever witnessed
5129 2018-11-17 20:02:56 These *astards are essentially promoting Saudi headchopper oil while crippling the canadian industry.  You’re muted due to association.
5130 2018-11-17 20:02:50 And pricing their oil in dollars...
5131 2018-11-17 20:02:22 As an Astros fan I am pleased with the deal. I liked what I saw with the Jays last year.

5134 2018-11-17 20:01:59 There is no need for fracking or further oil drilling, onshore of offshore. Mankind has the technology & the wealth, if not the will, to rapidly divest ourselves of the fossil fuel industry. This industry represents an existential threat to ALL life on earth

5138 2018-11-17 20:01:37 Ain't gonna happen as long as there is oil in the Golan and Genie Energy, the company that is extracting it has shareholders like Dick Cheney and Jared Kushner to name some.
5139 2018-11-17 20:00:57 Had to put an oil change in the schedule and budget. Yea responsibility 
5140 2018-11-17 20:00:55 Lol
5141 2018-11-17 20:00:47 Nothing like a fresh oil change
5142 2018-11-17 20:00:45 The only reason we deal with them at all is oil. That country is a human rights disgrace.

5146 2018-11-17 20:00:28 Yup. Saw an article in the NYT about CBD oil. Even when it had 0 to do w/opioids people still made comments about "legal heroin pills" & how millennials are cutting in2 their use w/CBD. Smh.
5147 2018-11-17 20:00:20 I’m getting a oil change and the guy said I do 3300 a month... that’s bad 
5148 2018-11-17 20:00:16 Spilled sesame oil on myself and the carpet 4 hours ago

5153 2018-11-17 19:58:52 It's possible that the stuff you get for your cat is fine for humans, too. I mean, if it's just a CBD-infused, edible oil (something like sunflower oil, for example), and nothing else, there isn't much of a difference, if any. Just the labelling and marketing.
5154 2018-11-17 19:58:44 I wanna try the gallbladder cleanse a lil while after I give birth..but that drinking straight olive oil got me scared ima throw tf up

5160 2018-11-17 19:57:55 Same! I had oil painting class in high school and I really enjoyed it!
5161 2018-11-17 19:57:49 I use to work there oil at 375/ 12 minutes. salt water marinate for 6-12hours. Egg an butter as the wet batter an wheat flour right before frying. Chicken must be in oil covered at least 3/4’s. Your welcome.
5162 2018-11-17 19:57:44 Common oil uno. Whew chileeeee, weakest link
5163 2018-11-17 19:57:43 It has potatoes in it, but: I like to make a huge dish of chunked root vegetables, beets and *parsnips* and turnips and potatoes and sweet potatoes and carrots, toss them in olive oil, paprika, fresh herbs, salt and pepper, roast them until edible.
5164 2018-11-17 19:57:39 This is my first Christmas with a bearded spouse. Retailers seem to be pushing 'beard oil' as a suitable gift. Is having an oily beard something to aspire to? Women don't get bought 'hair lard'. I'm confused tbh.
5165 2018-11-17 19:57:33 I love cooking with sesame oil, it’s the loveliest smell in the world, I wish I could have a sesame oil scented candle :’) 
5166 2018-11-17 19:57:28 I just learned that the reason I was born on the day that I was born was because my mother drank castor oil to make me come out quicker
5167 2018-11-17 19:57:27 Without the rules the House can pass legislation and put the Senate and Trump in the awkward position of deciding whether to block it even though it's extremely popular or to pass it too. With those rules, the House can't pass anything substantial.
5168 2018-11-17 19:57:26 What is this reverse propaganda, your like a sneak oil merchant.
5169 2018-11-17 19:57:17 While that’s true, I’ve read and heard on NPR that Saudi oil is necessary to keep global economy stable.
5170 2018-11-17 19:57:10 Caffeine & Argan Oil Hair Mask I like the most

5177 2018-11-17 19:56:02 Saints can’t get their garments stained, no matter the oil spilling around. Buhari is innocent! 
5178 2018-11-17 19:56:01 Non pas pour du gas oil où des nèfles mais pour faire aux injustices du gouvernement qui cible une catégorie de citoyens & qui favorise une autre, elle est donc DCD pour ses idées, sa liberté contre les privilèges,comme une une femme aux barricades, paix à son âme, condoléances
5179 2018-11-17 19:56:00 Gonna oil up these door hinges bc there’s no reason why opening a door is so mf loud in this house. Can u tell I’m upset lol

5181 2018-11-17 19:55:58 Never cook in shorts! The tong slipped, it went plop & hot oil on me 
5182 2018-11-17 19:55:53 Well then they got all big and fat and died and turned into oil.

5184 2018-11-17 19:55:34 It's oil ?
5185 2018-11-17 19:55:19 Putting 3 drops of oregano oil underneath the tongue works wonders for me. Also ginger, honey lemon tea with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in it. Pluses: Lysine, vitamin c, vitamin d, echinacea, zincs with copper supplements  if you have the funds.
5186 2018-11-17 19:55:07 The White House is the people’s house so access for the press is inviolate. Who the organizations send is their prerogative. If the president doesn’t like it he can resign and go back to being the shyster snake oil salesman he’s always been but on his own time.
5187 2018-11-17 19:54:53 My cats fleas all went away when I switched him to a special no carb raw meat diet and brewers yeast and coconut oil as snacks!
5188 2018-11-17 19:54:42 The didn’t yell at Abby, they bullied & threatened her saying they are boycotting her new show...all for tweeting what has been the norm for 2 years #Lyatt.  But yeah...thanks for giving those squeaky wheels some oil.  Maybe they’ll actually hashtag the show now and help us trend
5189 2018-11-17 19:54:32 They're so much in this ummah
5190 2018-11-17 19:54:29 Demand for oil is declining around the Globe.
Current price is in the mid 60-s approaching the ideal 
price of $55. When oil goes down to the 40-s, small 
producers will be hurting, and if it stays there, they will be
forced to close down. Then the price will skyrocket again.
5191 2018-11-17 19:54:28 I missed last night. Is it still on YouTube? I wanted to see the reactions of the jalapeno and motor oil one.
5192 2018-11-17 19:54:26 Ещё прекраснее
5193 2018-11-17 19:54:21 Put my #Gu puddings back in @sainsburys today because they have palm oil in them. No idea if it’s sustainable or not (google couldn’t tell me). Well done @IcelandFoods, although I wasn’t in your store - the ad has a bigger purpose, and it’s working.
5194 2018-11-17 19:54:20 #minelab #equinox provided me with some coins today "me happy" but had to place them in oil could not see or read a thing #crossingmyfingers just hope that it helps no better thing then oil right?
5195 2018-11-17 19:54:12 that’s like saying oil is a created thing that we will never run out of
5196 2018-11-17 19:54:10 The highlight of the day is me burning my thighs with hot oil.. while  frying chicken & I am a vegetarian
5197 2018-11-17 19:53:53 Economic Socialism bankrupted that country. The govt was subsidizing every item from fuel to drugs and essential commodities refused to understand the changes in the economic climate occasioned by drop in oil prices. So they sunk.
5198 2018-11-17 19:53:53 Someone said you let the oil bully you  ahh you’re done out here
5199 2018-11-17 19:53:47 اتفق والله عطيته snake oil لازم يعوضني كل شي بحقه
5200 2018-11-17 19:53:45 off to the drachmaerama for some olive oil and cheap sandals
5201 2018-11-17 19:53:44 Can’t even compare the two. $6M was cost value of players back in Aug 2012. Duchene, Tavares also same number among many others.

Fast forward 5 years (and today) — we’re looking at a completely different number for young stars coming off ELC’s.

Different ball game.
5202 2018-11-17 19:53:43 Please. They want our oil they want our water gee. They want lots our fish. I could go on
5203 2018-11-17 19:53:33 Plus we get 40% of our oil from Canada
5204 2018-11-17 19:53:26 if this rosehip seed oil does nothing for my face i...
5205 2018-11-17 19:53:20 MBS you are leading the most powerful country in the world in term of oil richness. We strongly believe and support you for the stability of our security, the growth of our economy and for the development of the country. My god bless you and may God bless the kingdom #we_love_mbs
5206 2018-11-17 19:53:12 OECD demand for oil peaked in 2005, with a post 2009 recovery out of the deep lows of the great recession (that did not get back to the previous highs). If you inspect the chart of Italy carefully, the italy collapse is behind us now. Recent demand is mostly flat. HTH.
5207 2018-11-17 19:53:04 Edler has been injured for half the season bro lol
5208 2018-11-17 19:52:43 Why does Kanna have to be so high maintenance around the holidays!?! New battery, oil change, new brake lights, plus I know there's stuff they suggested to repair last time...uggggh... 
5209 2018-11-17 19:52:35 Thanks, Gingy. I'd like to point out I'm also a little (sometimes a lot) feisty with pipeline/oil sands opponents who use inaccurate and biased info. Is it too much to ask that we (esp. fellow journalists like Staples) care about being accurate and fact-based?
5210 2018-11-17 19:52:20 Trump occasionally blurts out the truth. Pence is actually creepier. Trump is a snake oil salesman. Pence is a funeral broker.
5211 2018-11-17 19:52:14 Pretend like you just made chicken and didn't wash your hands and that it's excellent for those fly away beard hairs. Ika will love it.  a little editing magic and its: Chicken Hands Beard Oil ™

5216 2018-11-17 19:51:19 I like cbd oil. It works well for anxiety and sleep
5217 2018-11-17 19:51:14 @MBuhari supporters reactions to @atiku's ideas about NNPC show why like their master they may never own more than 150 cows in their lifetime. NNPC is just the cash cow used to milk our oil resources. Oil is business. Businesses are better driven by private hands with capacity
5218 2018-11-17 19:51:06 We never held ourselves accountable for destroying #Iraq for oil. People need to take responsibility and speak up loudly against illegal actions! @SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan @SecNielsen
5219 2018-11-17 19:50:59 Red Oil
5220 2018-11-17 19:50:55 Would be hanging up lanterns and burning whale oil.
5221 2018-11-17 19:50:48 Here we are wide open as far as the rules, on potency. I never dreamed it would be possible. I can buy oil, wax, Bud, drinks you name it. I think the potstore I go to has the largest menu in the world. There has to be 300 different flavors of Bud alon.
5222 2018-11-17 19:50:33 China, Russia, with the US not far behind. Earth in peril if these countries don't respond immediately to #ClimateChange. We can't take oil money with us. Leave a legacy for our children. @EPA #ClimatePolicy @HouseDemocrats #ClimateStudy
5223 2018-11-17 19:50:31 I didn’t have an oil pan so I had to lift my car up hella and out a fucking Tupperware container under there 
5224 2018-11-17 19:50:24 I think God over did it on the irony when creating me. An artist with asthma that acts up around oil paint?
5225 2018-11-17 19:50:23 Boycott the famigerate Speculation for Oil Spill! #TheRespect #NativeAmericanHeritage #EndCoal
5226 2018-11-17 19:50:11 I came to get an oil change and this lady was leaving and said "they told me 2-3 hours and I have to wait here"

Ma'am, mind your business. I'm going to drop this off, take a car service home, and come back before closing. 

I know the routine!
5227 2018-11-17 19:50:04 beard oil
5228 2018-11-17 19:50:03 I know this is a really petty thing to get hung up on but his hair is so ridiculous it makes me think he’s some B movie villain who wants to sell the town cause there is oil underneath it lmao
5229 2018-11-17 19:49:55 My older sister went to a "corporate talk" Bill gave in Toronto once (she was working for Shell Oil).  She said that the tickets for the evening dinner and lecture were $5000 a pop!  She was "mesmerized" by Bill's charisma.
My sister lacks discernment...
5230 2018-11-17 19:49:51 A girl told me the other day she loved the skin on my face. Its so smooth and literally pimple free. On top of being melanated to the max  coconut oil and Aveeno will have you smoother than baby lotion wipes. 
5231 2018-11-17 19:49:50 Oil went up by 20p only!!
God the French are quick off the mark, to go on strikes.
5232 2018-11-17 19:49:39 so how are you trading it.   For oil I use UCO
5233 2018-11-17 19:49:30 To be ultra-specific three day week was to save electricity < coal preservation < fear of industrial action < wage caps < runaway inflation < oil crisis 

Factually, industrial action followed the 3DW introduction. Heath managed to spin the obverse which is the story that stuck
5234 2018-11-17 19:49:26 Dougie doesn't realize that all it takes is a natural disaster or act of terrorism, that could affect supply, to give oil companies reason to jack up prices considerably. Or any excuse for that matter. Cap prices on his part? Wishful thinking.
5235 2018-11-17 19:49:24 เราก็หัวใจจะวาย ลุ้นแทบตาย คือก็รู้นะว่าเค้าโตแล้ว เค้ารู้จักระวัง แต่มันอดห่วงไม่ได้ นี่ถึงกะหยุดร้องเพลง เพราะมัวกลั้นหายใจยุ่ เผลอหน่อย ก็ร้อง เฮียๆ อย่าๆ ยังกะเค้าจะได้ยิน 555
5236 2018-11-17 19:49:23 Either way, getting the fuel out helps everybody.  It helps the poor, and could prevent a war when you understand the politics of oil.  My engine solves this.  Energy will be very cheap....and clean.
5237 2018-11-17 19:49:18 So the US has smaller population to land area ratio, which means it has a lot more land to build solar and wind farms. The problem is not that the richest country on earth is too incompetent to go 100% renewable. It’s the oil companies don’t want to abandon their infrastructure.
5238 2018-11-17 19:49:17 is it dangerous to oil pull while dry fasting? idk who i’m asking but #healthtwitter #naturaltwitter #naturalhealthtwitter

5241 2018-11-17 19:49:08 It's sad if you sit on top of oil reserves that you where not aware of. When others have to inform you that you will become rich because of "our"internal combustion engine.
5242 2018-11-17 19:49:01 พอจะนอนดันนอนไม่หลับ

5246 2018-11-17 19:48:50 Where the bruh chicken & oil at?! I’m tryna celebrate. 
5247 2018-11-17 19:48:49 Sin is fiction, an excuse to put people down. Oh but you have a cure! Snake oil.
5248 2018-11-17 19:48:46 & companies like Nestle jumping on the palm oil concerns now and promoting that are already using sustainable palm oil might sway public opinion in their favour 
5249 2018-11-17 19:48:42 Saudis & MBS spectacularly ruthless and brutal. They may be funneling oil money back into Trump pockets, but war on helpless Yemen & Khashoggi murder horrific. Stop Saudi arms sales.
5250 2018-11-17 19:48:22 I think we can safely say that the 'something' in 'somethings smells good' is almost always chopped garlic and onion cooking in oil.
5251 2018-11-17 19:48:06 what kind of oil do YOU use sir
5252 2018-11-17 19:48:05 I’m on board with the same thesis and long oil. Was just trying to explain what the rest of the market is probably seeing
5253 2018-11-17 19:47:37 When your country’s government is being managed, manipulated is better, by snake oil salesmen and grifters in pin stripe suits you can be assured of a constant drone of lies, fantasies and an assortment of misogynistic neoliberal wet dreams.
5254 2018-11-17 19:47:20 Qatar ended it’s indirect military presence in Syria and demonstrated that political shift in foreign policy by investing huge money in Russian  state owned oil company.Russian soldiers were fighting against terrorist at that time in close combat.
5255 2018-11-17 19:47:16 You must be talking about Obummer. Did nothing for 8 years, doubled our national debt, dissed our military, allowed our military to be weakened, not enough equipment. Should be in front of a firing squad. Traitor. Sold oil to the Russians.
5256 2018-11-17 19:47:08 Coconut oil
5257 2018-11-17 19:47:06 In your opinion what will happen in oil price?
5258 2018-11-17 19:47:03 Perhaps pushing for more sustainable palm oil is a way forward, giving providers the motivation they need?
5259 2018-11-17 19:46:52 if you haven’t been seduced by a bowl of olive oil and spices and started crying with your eyes wide open al in the corner booth of a @calpizzakitchen at 12:43 then what are you doing
5260 2018-11-17 19:46:48 Iceland own products claim to be palm oil free, hence their fab advert, but I don't suppose you'd write home about their own brand chocolate .
5261 2018-11-17 19:46:33 I went in for an oil change and now I have to get my front brakes repaired.
5262 2018-11-17 19:46:26 I just hafta get into art. I’m buying an oil painting starter set from Amazon tomorrow.
5263 2018-11-17 19:46:13 no doubt that those options premium in oil and nat gas exploded and they could not meet margin calls.  Complete blowups tend to do that to people. Basically two ways to trade options - either trade directionally or trade volatility - both have risks.  Read When Genius Failed
5264 2018-11-17 19:46:11 Okay so I just got an oil change at Pep Boys and my son was being fussy and throwing a tantrum. So I took him outside to calm him down and to get him some fresh air. So when I walk back in the store, I overhear the dumb ass cashier make a stupid remark about him
5265 2018-11-17 19:46:07 More than double the price of hungry man.
What knocked me off is, they have a seasoning pack filled with Palm oil
5266 2018-11-17 19:45:59 This is funny cause I know you got weed on you... but you ain't got an oil change yet 
5267 2018-11-17 19:45:55 I imagine she is trying to say she is very hairy, but idk tho

5273 2018-11-17 19:45:03 Petrol prices are going to crash further from here . After US China trade war the oil demand will collapse some 20 to 30% from it's peak , being the largest oil consumer any sluggish demands will cause prices to move further southwards

5284 2018-11-17 19:43:58 @samblackmusic_ If you ever feel your voice not showing up? Use 2 Fish oil/Omega-3 per day and notice the difference within days. It works really well. Whose vocal warm-up do you use?
5285 2018-11-17 19:43:57 Clean and well maintained. I have a lifetime warranty so everything has been kept in new condition. Oil changed every 3000 miles.

5298 2018-11-17 19:42:34 This is not all that relevant if a statistic. Oil is traded on an international commodities exchange. The oil produced here does not necessarily stay here. Even refined components can and are shipped overseas.
5299 2018-11-17 19:42:14 Why put palm oil inside moimoi
5300 2018-11-17 19:42:09 Let me go oil my hair and fix it up yah... tone down the fuzziness
5301 2018-11-17 19:42:01 I have spent a small fortune today ordering business cards, stickers and fragrance oil.  I hope it will all be worth it.
5302 2018-11-17 19:41:53 Two brand new tires. Oil changed. Just need a new brake light and my car will be good as new
5303 2018-11-17 19:41:50 パンMIXは入るところない気もするけどね。まー、コールは好きな思いをぶつけりゃいいのです
5304 2018-11-17 19:41:44 This is me! I’m so tempted to buy so much stuff now. Me that My highest skin concoction was Ori and coconut oil.
5305 2018-11-17 19:41:39 Buy from me, I sell perfume oil with nice fragrance
5306 2018-11-17 19:41:25 Oil painting classes NOW 
proud of you our dear students

5307 2018-11-17 19:41:21 Where y’all get oil changes?
5308 2018-11-17 19:41:11 Lol!

Though oil is mostly from plankton and other sea floor debris. Coal is from trees before bacteria/fungi evolved the ability to digest lignin.
5309 2018-11-17 19:41:09 Thats why you should patronise me. I sell perfume oil. Nice fragrance and they last. Dm is open
5310 2018-11-17 19:41:04 Lol with the healing animation looking like a back rub and all jus pull out some massage oil and scented candles like ‘come here daddy I MEAN DAVID’
5311 2018-11-17 19:41:00 Can you stop extracting oil from the oil sands instead?
5312 2018-11-17 19:40:57 well, we follow three. I mostly trade oil options, and about 1/4 gold and silver.  Few select dividend stocks for steady cash.
5313 2018-11-17 19:40:39 Their last stand for oil, coal, continuation of perpetuating dirty fossil fuels, where they have made tons of money, they r desperate to keep it going, desperate to suppress clean, renewable energy.
5314 2018-11-17 19:40:38 Gud oye....
Iranian oil
5315 2018-11-17 19:40:37 Ken, the GERS info severely under reports the Scottish economy.  Much of Scottish oil gets 'credited' to England, along with much of Scotland's exports that get shipped out of England.  You are better than you think you are as a nation.
5316 2018-11-17 19:40:36 They look fantastic. What oil did she use?
5317 2018-11-17 19:40:31 Russian MFA is trolling and trying to stir us up; there's nothing wrong with the French company buying the LNG (possibly mixed with other LNG) and selling it. Same happens with oil coming into Washington from Russia's Far East.
5318 2018-11-17 19:40:23 Частенько бывает ахах
Особенно,когда книгу или ФФ читаю...мама проходит и думает наверное "емае,кого я родила, сумасшедшая сама с собой болтает.." ахахах
5319 2018-11-17 19:40:22 As long as they have the oil and gas industry in common, they will continue to do business with each other, even if they don’t like each other. The US has Israel’s interest in mind, too, so we have to think about that. I know you know.
5320 2018-11-17 19:40:16 Before calling me names can you list current price of any 5 oil blends. Also can you please also tell me how much foreign oil Canada imports and what is average price we pay for this oil?
5321 2018-11-17 19:40:12 Buhari tell Nigerians to move away from over dependance on oil... Yet he appointed petroleum department to himself.

5323 2018-11-17 19:39:59 They care more about their oil contracts unlike people's lives. Michael Jackson said it all.
5324 2018-11-17 19:39:55 Trumps tariffs undermine NAFTA, high interest rates will kill the stock market, NK’s expanding their nuclear program, crude oil was down this week, TPP will only benefit Washington & an aweful idea for the American consumer....Go put your Rogain on loser.
5325 2018-11-17 19:39:50 I use peppermint essential oil on my temple! Makes it tingly, and the minty smell relieves the sinuses
5326 2018-11-17 19:39:47 Would have been great to have someone on the panel sharing the perspective of that 82% of younger people ready to think about moving on from oil. Are wildfires and melting permafrost seriously not enough to make us realize that our reliance on fossil fuels has to end?
5327 2018-11-17 19:39:44 More into Volcanic or Turpentine Oil, type of guy
5328 2018-11-17 19:39:41 Getting my oil changed and Jiffy Lube is crazy busy, but they have Holiday Baking Challenge running on TV. Y’all, take your time, I haven’t seen this episode yet.

5334 2018-11-17 19:39:12 Hey CBD Oil Wizard(@cbdoilwizard), thank you for following me
5335 2018-11-17 19:39:02 200,000/3000 = 66 oil changes at $50/each = $3300 in oil change savings.
5336 2018-11-17 19:38:56 Really??

Why??

Are you trying to lure people you see as the enemy to it so you can murder them later??

All your oil and money can't buy you a soul.
5337 2018-11-17 19:38:53 Well past that point. They are afraid of angering them. The UK won't take in #AsiaBibi out of fear, which is prob best for her. She wouldn't be safe there anyway.
5338 2018-11-17 19:38:53 Ruminant enteric methane is a flow emission. The CH4 breaks back down into the same CO2 and water it came from  (grass) within 10 years. Fossil methane from fugitive emissions in the oil coal and gas industry is adding to net warming; enteric emissions are not.
5339 2018-11-17 19:37:42 Playing solitaire on a mobile device, drinking alcohol or (more recently) CBD oil
5340 2018-11-17 19:37:41 i was about to do my oil change and i opened my car door and soot flew into my fucking eye and i just closed my door and came back inside
5341 2018-11-17 19:37:36 Can you paint, Paul? Like, well enough to enjoy rendering your ideas into painted images? If you gave me a box of oil paints and told me to "be imaginative", I would very quickly get bored. I would need teaching.

5344 2018-11-17 19:37:21 #1 voting issue should be getting money (publicly funded elections & non compete clauses) out of politics, until that happens oil/gas donors will win destroying the world. @davidsirota probably has the best twitter/articles about oil/gas owning politicians.
5345 2018-11-17 19:37:18 It is time for the world to go solar. To get away from high oil pricess.
5346 2018-11-17 19:37:12 Gold, silver, copper, uranium, lithium, oil.
5347 2018-11-17 19:37:09 Id bet on it.
5348 2018-11-17 19:36:53 Wrote an assessment on, If the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector, it will likely negatively impact the U.S. economy and increase the price of oil at least in the short term. Also, China/Russia may seek to capitalize on the opportunity.
5349 2018-11-17 19:36:52 Nobama in my white house (keep in mind, my house is painted white)!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Most clowns are just NSA spies in disguise! Never speak secrets to clowns!
5350 2018-11-17 19:36:50 So this is what embracing each other’s way of life and cultures is all about! Again I say why should anyone be forced to tolerate such an intolerable culture? It’s oil and water...

5353 2018-11-17 19:36:35 well yes my point was more there's no choice atm and it is virtually impossible to find products that don't contain palm oil (plus it can be labelled "vegetable oil" so how are we supposed to know). there should be no products that contain it
5354 2018-11-17 19:36:20 They tryna take all my money at Take 5 Oil change

5358 2018-11-17 19:35:20 is anyone used to using coconut oil? like for cooking? i’m considering to try it out
5359 2018-11-17 19:35:17 Hey #macdonalds #terminalDdallasftworth, why don't your employees know what kind of oil is in your fryaltors?  Vegetable what?  #nut allergy, #peanutkillme
5360 2018-11-17 19:35:16 And Trudeau supports them by continuing to buy their oil!!!
5361 2018-11-17 19:34:55 your putting more miles on my car, i already need a oil change
5362 2018-11-17 19:34:50 You are looking at specific D10. Have to look statewide. There are WPIAL teams that have never competed at Heinz that are there today. Even some local teams had a more level playing field. Oil City GM classic games this year don't happen under 4 classes.
5363 2018-11-17 19:34:45 And now i find myself carrying hemp bags, buying bamboo products and not buying palm oil.. But as left wing do goody as that all sounds, it's not bad to give a shit. Despite what people say.
5364 2018-11-17 19:34:37 My husband finally taking my car to get an oil change...it was at 5% 
5365 2018-11-17 19:34:21 @Sears yo I heard you guys got the deals on oil changes?? Is that true???
5366 2018-11-17 19:34:21 Cooking oil
5367 2018-11-17 19:34:00 IMHO, the answer to opposition from your opponents is a better campaign to convince Canadians that pipelines/oil sands are beneficial and necessary. Whinging, sniveling demands for the state to protect Alberta oil and gas from nasty activists are embarrassing.
5368 2018-11-17 19:33:49 Bruh. They can’t pass it at all. 
And if they do retake the senate in 2020, they’ll be free to change the rules
5369 2018-11-17 19:33:46 Elizabeth I am truly confused at your perspective on this documentary. Snake oil? There are hundreds (thousands!) of studies that show a direct, causal role for the microbiome in conditions ranging from Alzheimer's to cancer to OF COURSE diabetes and autoimmune disease!
5370 2018-11-17 19:33:35 Trump will use the Khashoggi killing & sanction Iran to claim more shares of oil market. That's for sure, in the plan.....Just wait.
5371 2018-11-17 19:33:33 Exactly, Emerald is in love with someone who dosent really care to much about her, I feel like if Cinder wasn't so far down the wrong path she could've redeemed herself but she kinda ruined it for me when she killed pyrrha and almost killed Weiss.
5372 2018-11-17 19:33:31 Sainbury’s do great vegan mince pies - don’t actually know if they have palm oil too but every chance the recipe is different! (But yes also remove all ya cruelty free/environmentally damaging products plz)
5373 2018-11-17 19:33:30 Mate did you know Nutella is full of it? I love palm oil!
5374 2018-11-17 19:33:20 I hate driving behind a vehicle that’s burning oil. I literally can feel my lungs starting to die.
5375 2018-11-17 19:33:15 2 tablespoons of honey, 10 drops oil of oregano, a little bit of cayenne or tuneric, tsp of apple cider vinager, I garlic clove crushed.  Stir altogether. Take a tablespoon a few times a day.  Oil of oregano is a natural antibiotic. Hope you have a speedy recovery.
5376 2018-11-17 19:33:12 Would still dip for oil no matter what 
5377 2018-11-17 19:32:49 This YOUWIN something will be remembered like 'Nigerian Oil Palm to Malaysia'. The rest of the world will make use and profit from a wonderful idea. Nigeria will only be referring to how she started it. I will tell my grandkids a certain Prof. Osinbajo bungled it.
5378 2018-11-17 19:32:47 Very helpful. To non naval person, the idea that a modern fighting ship with all the technology available could not avoid a lumbering great oil tanker that must have been clearly visible on radar. Your narrative is clear, yet still i have no clue what the destroyer was thinking.
5379 2018-11-17 19:32:47 Cry. Oil. Repeat.
5380 2018-11-17 19:32:42 Theives essential oil.

5385 2018-11-17 19:31:28 My mom asks where she can find CBD oil. I said at a gas station or a vape store but you will need a pen. She said, “oh I have a bunch in my purse!” I can’t stand her

5391 2018-11-17 19:30:49 I need some coconut oil
5392 2018-11-17 19:30:44 What about an oil like Sea buckthorn fruit oil? I have one from the Ordinary, it's very light. I always put it on before my moisturizer (only at night), mainly bc it's so damn orange and putting moisturizer on after helps the color not transfer as bad.
5393 2018-11-17 19:30:44 Sitting @bigotires  had an appt FOR AN OIL CHANGE at 12... it's 12:30 and still haven't  looked at my car. They're telling it won't be till 2:30 untill my car is ready. Will never come back.
5394 2018-11-17 19:30:43 Afraid not just smell like dad maybe little like gas n oil
5395 2018-11-17 19:30:42 Меня что-то резко переклинило, и я подумала, почему бы нет.

Спасибо за комплимент 
5396 2018-11-17 19:30:41 LMAO. I put peppermint oil with it. Mostly for lung/internal inflammation bc of all this damn smoke. If nothing happens, I never will again.
I'd also never waste my real weed on this, lol

5401 2018-11-17 19:29:52 government-controlled companies are responsible for 75% of global crude oil production.
Learning is fun huh?
5402 2018-11-17 19:29:38 Well I do know he does sponsor tidal energy here in nova scotia. And also wind energy.  You mean he hasnt got a deal for oil .so that is were you are coming up with this. We have to look at other energy means in Canada. Not just oil
5403 2018-11-17 19:29:25 I could eat 3,282 tomatoes in oil!
5404 2018-11-17 19:29:23 Tastes like fried oil.

5408 2018-11-17 19:29:03 I was tore up yesterday of that oil
5409 2018-11-17 19:29:02 Yes overthrow, because the Saudis planned to use Yemen to attack Iran. Believe me, Iran is not a threat to Western civilization. It's all about Petro Dollar and oil.
5410 2018-11-17 19:28:53 Omg I just tweeted something like that 
5411 2018-11-17 19:28:50 I agree that some of the technology and concepts that blockchain uses are useful, just not blockchain. Git used merkle trees. It is not blockchain. Most of the blockchain touted, especially ‘private’ is snake oil.
5412 2018-11-17 19:28:46 Provided that Oil is still Government owned, the rate of corruption will continue increasing, Standard of living will continue to increase, Oil sales will start to reduce and how will Nigeria survive without oil sales?
5413 2018-11-17 19:28:33 Yeah, what does a scarecrow need with oil?
5414 2018-11-17 19:28:28 All stuff and nonsense, disrupting people’s lives is an own goal. To have a real effect invade Westminster or Whitehall or take over an oil refinery. Bridges is kid’a stuff

5416 2018-11-17 19:28:23 We had sheep dislodge low oil alarm wire on one of those motors
5417 2018-11-17 19:28:07 @subaru_usa is lucky they have good customer service at their dealerships. 3rd time in 23K miles my oil light has come on. “These manuals seems to burn more” is not an optimal reason. Only one year left on the lease thankfully.
5418 2018-11-17 19:28:05 I don’t disagree w AB oil but those in charge have negated the costs and the environment for decades and that’s got them what? New leadership and not self interest like @WBrettWilson etc. Otherwise we’ll sit back and count the angry tweets that fall into the abyss.

5428 2018-11-17 19:26:31 Falkland Islands has nothing to do with North Sea oil installations.
The SAS' CT is a QRF to guard against terrorism aimed at them. They use helicopters to get there.
With the vast area covered by oil exploration and production, one submarine would be useless.
5429 2018-11-17 19:26:30 oil works well for dry lips! (not like cooking oil tho)
5430 2018-11-17 19:26:28 I hear olive oil is a great solution for when you're too lazy to walk any further than the kitchen
5431 2018-11-17 19:26:28 Think its the lighting because I used a wash one the cloth, and then did nuln oil wash over the whole figure...
5432 2018-11-17 19:26:25 Well me and the wifey just spent my damn near whole Saturday @KiaofSavannah for an oil change that she had an appointment for. 11 to 1422. Backed the car in and didnt say nada...Then got the nerve to offer a free damn air filter..GTFOH...Well guess we will make that ride to b'wic
5433 2018-11-17 19:26:08 My mom went to check my oil for me ... not much in there so she then proceeded to yell “BITCH IF BLOW THIS SHIT UP I WILL NOT GET YOU ANOTHER ONE”

5435 2018-11-17 19:25:49 Who cares?  My engine unplugs Aramco.  Understand?  I'm trying to see if you are smart enough to engage in a discussing of the engine.  NOT one CO2 alarmist has actually discuss it.  Why?  They just want to complain and ask Daddy (gov) to save them from the big bad oil.  Crazy.
5436 2018-11-17 19:25:45 I had dark stretch marks after giving birth. Used cell tone tissue oil. In my lotion and on it's own. It took a while but it worked. Still have some marks, but they are lighter.
5437 2018-11-17 19:25:34 Yeh right I’m sure there’ll be a hard border for oil and gas right enough
5438 2018-11-17 19:25:25 Not him Saudi oil and wealth still He is not that powerful to target his father
5439 2018-11-17 19:25:14 ever thought about using oil on ur lips? it works really well
5440 2018-11-17 19:25:07 no downside to burning even more oil and natural gas, right?
5441 2018-11-17 19:25:05 Well, oil = money, is more important than people's lives in both the US and Saudi Arabia.
5442 2018-11-17 19:25:01 Are you playing tonight in Cowtown, Welcome to the Edmonton Oilers franchise. Need to put some Oil on the Flames tonight and extinguish those flames

5444 2018-11-17 19:24:57 Yeees, her voice actress is amazing, but know that I'm seeing her not so calm and collected it's putting me on the edge because she can snap at any moment and she knows where they are
5445 2018-11-17 19:24:42 So much for a me day. I just got price gouged for a fucking oil change, my car just died and all I wanted to do was just enjoy a day to myself. I literally can’t do anything fucking right.

5448 2018-11-17 19:24:31 The entire murder of Khashoggi appears to be a Deep State attempt to set-up the president, scuttle oil negotiations, and exonerate the CIA.  The CIA report exonerates itself from malfeasance, misfeasance etc.   However the report is extremely suspect...
5449 2018-11-17 19:24:19 Two ppl I know have sadly died of cancer recently both of them spent a fortune on cannabis oil as they were told it would cure it 
They both had gurus telling them what to do etc 
neither know each other but it didn’t work at all in any way starting to think its a cruel scam tbh

5454 2018-11-17 19:23:40 I recommend everyone to read "Oil, Politics and violence"
5455 2018-11-17 19:23:27 Yep, I had intended to change the oil & spark plug, as I always do, but didn't get around to it.

FWIW, the repair shop said to stick with my 20-year old machine, since new ones are almost all plastic.
5456 2018-11-17 19:23:26 @TripleH do you use any type of beard oil,beard wash,conditioner and or beard balm? If so what do you use?
5457 2018-11-17 19:23:25 Petroleum out! Electric In. Soon come the demise of the oil oligarchy. Lobbying bucks will not stop the upcoming blooding.

5465 2018-11-17 19:22:34 all 3 cars need oil changes, fuck
5466 2018-11-17 19:22:32 Coconut oil is comedogenic and will clog your pores. So basically you are doing the opposite of what the accutane is trying to prevent. I went to school for skincare I’m just trying to help :/
5467 2018-11-17 19:22:17 Really good that they have pushed the issue of palm oil this year.  I was trying to get more information earlier as to what to buy or avoid and it's a bit of a nightmare..
5468 2018-11-17 19:22:13 BEEECH SAME
5469 2018-11-17 19:22:09 @Oreo 
Stop using palm oil. There is no legitimate reason for it. The destruction to the earth cannot possibly be justified, and in case you don't realise, can't be reversed. What is your back up plan once the forests are gone? Do that now. Then our family might buy your products
5470 2018-11-17 19:22:07 Butter burns fast, Use oil
5471 2018-11-17 19:21:59 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.

5481 2018-11-17 19:21:22 No coach should guarantee you anything. They’re not magic. If a coach guarantees you success, they’re selling you snake oil. Legit coaches diagnose any issues they see and give you tangible advice based on experience and education to help fix them, but YOU do the work.

5485 2018-11-17 19:20:51 I used to trash Houston and not like coming here because of the big oil factories you see in the distance and all the barges and oil fields. But a friend of mine who works in oil & gas here told me, “you know who our biggest customers are? New York City.”
5486 2018-11-17 19:20:43 Also, no oil. Toast them in the pan dry.
5487 2018-11-17 19:20:40 Which one you use ? Cause the green did that to me just didn’t get flaky the argan oil one slick to the gods
5488 2018-11-17 19:20:38 Your image is misleading. How about Puerto Rico? How about his threats of cutting federal aid to Calif. because all the trees have’nt been cut down? How about his allowing oil and gas drilling in National parks? How about all the hate rhetoric he spews? He does nothing to protect
5489 2018-11-17 19:20:35 Hospitals/schools: "May we please have some funding? 

Neo-con politicians: "Lol, go fuck yourselves

5490 2018-11-17 19:20:26 carrots cooked with oil is a better choice nutritionwise, so don't feel bad about it.  
5491 2018-11-17 19:20:25 Syd out here giving me oil showers  instead of champagne showers 
5492 2018-11-17 19:20:24 Oil is NOT the problem.  I wish them well.  They do a great service.  My point is that why waste money on something you don't need to use?
5493 2018-11-17 19:20:16 What about the NASCAR driver, the Big Oil Man, the Hollywood Producer and the pretty chick with the tiny nose and sarcastic wit?

5495 2018-11-17 19:20:10 I'm getting an oil change and they are playing Big Bang Theory in the lobby please help
5496 2018-11-17 19:20:10 The look on his face in that picture tells you everything you need to know.   That's the look of defiance and the look of someone who thinks, in this case the oil industry, is a bunch of whiners & complainers.   Don't expect this empty suit to do anything to correct the problem
5497 2018-11-17 19:20:08 Your sunglasses are made with oil. Is the source ethical Gay friendly Canadian oil or from your friends in dictator regimes?  #LGBTQ
5498 2018-11-17 19:19:56 If Alberta wants to make the future, then get off oil and build a renewable economy. That is the future. Alberta's future and the world's future. Alberta will die if it does not do that and quickly.
5499 2018-11-17 19:19:53 MLM scheme idea: essential oil septum ring diffuser
5500 2018-11-17 19:19:47 So.....how does this impact the MOTIVA Oil Co. he and his family own in Port Charles and Houston, Texas? They employ hundreds of people. Awkward. They all work for a cold blooded murderer of a US resident.
5501 2018-11-17 19:19:38 See Saudi Arabia for example, is selling Aramco, their largest Oil company. This will make Saudi harness other of their resources and in few years time, they will independent of oil and still compete at the Global market.
5502 2018-11-17 19:19:36 @MoviePass @mitch__lowe Every day is the same. Little to nothing available, never anything worth seeing, impossible view times. You are snake oil salesmen and crooks. Legal fine print as your excuse for stealing money. Can't wait for the canned response!!! #dontbother, #fraud
5503 2018-11-17 19:19:36 My boo washed my car inside & out, got my oil changed, filled it up with gas, & got it a new air freshener. Feels like a whole different car lol 
5504 2018-11-17 19:19:32 I need an oil change 
5505 2018-11-17 19:19:25 The Hall deal was fantastic but $6M when he signed it isn't the same as $6M now. To think Leon would have taken that $$$ qith term wasn't realistic. For me, his deal is fine.
5506 2018-11-17 19:19:25 sounds like my cousins old roomate..one time the psycho literally took her clothes and hid them in the garage and like put nails and oil all over them???
5507 2018-11-17 19:19:19 don’t use coconut oil directly on your skin if it is oily and prone to acne it clogs your pores and don’t use moisturisers without oil 

you can use coconut oil for growing longer and thicker brows and lashes cos it stimulates hair growth, great lip balm.
5508 2018-11-17 19:19:09 Remember that almost all of the 9/11 terrorists were actually Saudi citizens fresh from their home base and Bin Laden was Saudi aristocracy. Yet everyone kisses their collective arses for oil. Those eastern shitheads and especially Quebec pander to these fuckups?
5509 2018-11-17 19:18:58 Fish, borage, flax oil! I have terrible knees and this has changed the game.

5513 2018-11-17 19:18:48 Then maybe we don’t need crude oil either?
5514 2018-11-17 19:18:44 Look, I am totally pro oil as an energy source.  But why spend $50 to go 400 miles instead of just $2-4?  Oil is needs for products, but what I am says is for transit, most will be gone, most will be Nat Gas, and then H2 for a lot.  Why? CHEAPER.  Oil will have to be $1/gal gas
5515 2018-11-17 19:18:44 Hate when I have to reup on my natural products.. My tea tree oil damn near gone, I have to tilt the bottle in order to squeeze up a drop 
5516 2018-11-17 19:18:26 Have you ever been to Lucas Oil? It’s not an ugly dome...retractable roof. I am old enough to remember Old Soldier Field. You must not like making money because that’s what Final Fours and Super Bowls do
5517 2018-11-17 19:18:19 I will never understand what incentive the average person who is not an Oil exec has in denying the impacts, which can be seen in every place on the planet.
5518 2018-11-17 19:18:09 Eucalyptus and lavender oil in a hot steamy shower 
5519 2018-11-17 19:18:04 All those things are made from oil. The stuff you put in a gas tank is small potatoes. EVERYTHING is made from oil, including panels and battery parts. Unfortunately panels are also made from rare earth mined materials and child labour and are no replacement to real energy.

5521 2018-11-17 19:17:45 I don't see any problem with leaving them glued to windows, if that's where they want to be.

No need to distill oil just for solvents to unglue them. They wouldn't want that.
5522 2018-11-17 19:17:43 I want to use baby oil and wrap my hands around a long thin neck and slowly massage her neck from the base of her neck to her chin. Is there Any lady want me to do that to her?
5523 2018-11-17 19:17:43 How can the oil bully him like that 
5524 2018-11-17 19:17:39 Neck oil when I'm away so disappointed in you.
5525 2018-11-17 19:17:32 What u use butter, oil or spray?
5526 2018-11-17 19:17:31 Also. We produce more oil than we consume as a nation. We need to sell our products somewhere.
5527 2018-11-17 19:17:29 kasih baby cream ato baby oil sis
5528 2018-11-17 19:17:20 Anybody with any sense at all should be able to see through this #FakeNews .  Saudis have been in oil business for a very very long time. They were NOT tricked!  It’s called negotiating in good faith. Something the previous administrations were not interested in doing. #MAGA
5529 2018-11-17 19:16:53 So long the operators are paying appropriate taxes as well as royalties to the FGN and the oil bearing states.
5530 2018-11-17 19:16:50 Yep Big Oil framed the climate history so it would look like we're cooling.
5531 2018-11-17 19:16:31 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
5532 2018-11-17 19:16:26 I want put baby oil on the floor while my bd in the shower so he can slip and break every bone in his body 
5533 2018-11-17 19:16:26 I want @RSPOtweets to vote to ensure palm oil companies adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #palmoil policies. I can’t bear to see our #rainforests & precious #orangutan habitat destroyed #RSPO #RT16
5534 2018-11-17 19:16:25 Blockade S.A. until justice is done. Shut it all down, oil included. Seize all S.A. assets around the globe.

5537 2018-11-17 19:15:51 I heard mythalated spirit, Nivea cream, magnolia , and glycyrine, mix thm , I tried using Mythalated nd olive oil only and it dd reduce my stretch marks
5538 2018-11-17 19:15:47 Ok, what would happen if 80-95% of the oil is no longer needed?
5539 2018-11-17 19:15:40 I discovered there's literally like 3 brands of biscuit ever that don't have palm oil, not sure I can live without them 
5540 2018-11-17 19:15:35 But realistically you have quite a bit of wealth in Scotland, even leaving the oil aside, the beef is highly valued all over the world, the whisky is almost like a trade mark, you have a trade surplus...
5541 2018-11-17 19:15:31 just put oil in Nagi's veggies. now we wait.
5542 2018-11-17 19:15:21 If the pho joint ain’t got no chili oil, it’s prob trash ass
5543 2018-11-17 19:15:01 Some of you are so unbelievable. Like it or not, if this administration met the oil boom. They'll still run this country to recession. 
Of all military Presidents, only Buhari led the country to recession. 
America was in recession till Obama entered. He still turned things arnd.

5546 2018-11-17 19:14:24 Hey @Bill_Morneau  How about some support for the struggling resource industry out West; and the pipeline industry where construction jobs and shipping options are lacking. How about withdrawing C69? How about promoting & incentivizing Energy East to get rid of Saudi oil imports?
5547 2018-11-17 19:14:05 They are probably having olive oil and a cigarette or something light
5548 2018-11-17 19:14:03 My fuel cost in VA for 200,000 miles in Model 3 - $5333. My cost in a 25MPG vehicle - $26,666. Savings $21,333 on gas alone, not including oil changes and replace/repair of 1400 powertrain parts for gas car vs 200 parts for EV!

Keep on selling that Snake Oil Le Snek
5552 2018-11-17 19:13:21 It is not true.  Most of people recharge with clean Energy.   Oil kills the planet.  You don't have a valid argument.  Switch from fossil to clean Energy and save the planet for your children.   Think with Science facts not with careless interests.
5553 2018-11-17 19:13:15 Yep, and Obama’s administration offered Saudi Arabia more than $115 billion in weapons cause the love for Saudi oil just started with Frump.

5560 2018-11-17 19:12:21 A lunch idea... Chicken mince and leeks and snap peas baked with soy sauce. Serve on top of couscous in olive oil.
5561 2018-11-17 19:12:11 hungry and sleepy  they need to hurry up with my oil change
5562 2018-11-17 19:11:58 I bought my first essential oil diffuser today and baybee why did I wait so long? Oh I’m in heaven.

5564 2018-11-17 19:11:26 Also able to cast light, given some oil and an ignition source.
5565 2018-11-17 19:11:21 Uh huh, cause that's the only company that feeds at the public trough. Why do oil companies pay so much less tax in Canada than they pay everywhere else in the world they do business?
5566 2018-11-17 19:11:14 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5567 2018-11-17 19:11:12 Hogs slaughtered at Monticello produced lamp oil, soap and lard for cooking.
5568 2018-11-17 19:10:43 People don't realize that you have to thaw and dry the Turkey before you put the Turkey in the hot oil. Water and hot oil just don't mix. 
5569 2018-11-17 19:10:34 The U.S. is the top oil producer right now. However, we currently produce 11 million barrels/day but we consume 20 million barrels/day so we need to import foreign oil.
5570 2018-11-17 19:10:19 No one will be bankrupted because everything is made from/with oil, natural gas and coal. But certainly bring on new innovations.

5574 2018-11-17 19:10:01 city fans taking the piss because we are 8th??

In the first 15 years before oil money (93’ - 08’) city never climbed higher than 8th and that was only once and in half of those 15 years they were in the relegation zone - city weren’t even a mid-table team.
5575 2018-11-17 19:09:42 alright im back from getting my car fixed. had to buy a new serpentine belt and a new battery which was like, $200 altogether along with an oil change and more coolant. thank god for commission money
5576 2018-11-17 19:09:38 Oil is going into extinction. Every sane oil producing nation are divesting from oil. Saudi did. USA is the major exporter now. So why should any serious govt keep NNPC?! However, we should be worried about the transparency of the sale and the optimal use of the proceeds. Gbam.

5583 2018-11-17 19:08:23 America need your oil so now using you again. Get a lesson from referendum. since you have been isolated.

5586 2018-11-17 19:07:57 No butter, cream or much olive oil. No avocado or coconut. And no walnuts! But it doesn't stop me from being a foodie! Just an un-creamy/ un-oily foodie! :)
5587 2018-11-17 19:07:50 I told my dad I needed a oil change. And he sent me his mechanic number & a coupon 
5588 2018-11-17 19:07:49 @boudica2018 I've emailed @CadburyUK about using palm oil, so many petitions to sign not enough action, or such barbarism would be erradicated x
5589 2018-11-17 19:07:46 @biclighters ?   #diamondMatches?  #Kerosine ?  #Gas?  #Oil?  no,,,i got it.,,,,, #TiKiTorches!!!
5590 2018-11-17 19:07:37 I’m not meant to live in cold weather bc I literally drown myself in Shea butter and coconut oil but still be dry af 
5591 2018-11-17 19:07:31 Snake oil..
5592 2018-11-17 19:07:29 We have Venezuela & Iran so there is some time to take some oil fields as a replacement of something that should have never existed - shale miracle. The cycle has turned to big deflation, so repeat of 1929 so 8-20$ is a good price, same time China will disappear for 20 years.
5593 2018-11-17 19:07:26 Castor oil , kaleidoscope miracle drops , I would say wild growth oil but it has castor oil in it
5594 2018-11-17 19:07:13 True, but even Saudis have decided that they cannot run oil companies with all the volatility. It is severely capital intensive & this current structure where the NNPC is player, umpire and team owner at the same time, it was always going to end badly. This current setup is fraud
5595 2018-11-17 19:07:09 This is crazy! #tradewar will plummet #oil if they don't manipulate the commodity I bought #drip they public Friday that Chinese were ready to make a deal at 2:00pm market erase drop in 1:20 minutes. @jimcramer  is now @TheBubbleBubble aon the  camp 
5596 2018-11-17 19:07:08 Pls can someone tell me what NNPC is producing? The last time i bought gas there was early 2017. I don't know maybe they have switch to Palm oil produce.
5597 2018-11-17 19:07:07 We must end humanity’s dependency on oil - gay, straight or otherwise.  The future is sustainable, renewable and cleaner energy! @Greenpeace @MikeHudema @DavidSuzukiFDN @350 @UNEnvironment @UNFCCC
5598 2018-11-17 19:07:06 I let my grandma oil my scalp for me and now it feels a lot better .
5599 2018-11-17 19:07:05 Don’t do it... Oreos are one of the biggest Palm Oil offenders!
5600 2018-11-17 19:06:43 A voice of reason crying in the wilderness created by big oil.
5601 2018-11-17 19:06:42 Butter and oil on the go. Puppy dog pain relief 
5602 2018-11-17 19:06:35 Saudis murked that Khashoggi guy and then proceeded to lower oil prices like it was Black Friday, smh...
5603 2018-11-17 19:06:33 I think my hair is now officially addicted to argan oil, the expensive kind.

Spoiled-ass hair.
5604 2018-11-17 19:06:29 2. Now if you want to question the behind the scenes activities of Westminster and GW's friends Blair Brown Mandelson and others and the oil deals then that is another matter entirely
5605 2018-11-17 19:06:25 @kanyewest yo Kanye working on an oil painting of you sir! Hit me up
5606 2018-11-17 19:06:24 Ok, I take your claim at face value.  My engine will bankrupt big oil and Koch Bros.  Want to help me bankrupt them?  Happy to discuss it.  We can get the oil out and clean up the environment.  No smog or soot.  Is that what you want?  I have the solution.  Interested?
5607 2018-11-17 19:06:12 This moronic country still buys oil from China, SAUDI ARABIA and Nigeria everyday. For a liberal government to sit and talk about human rights and gender issues instead of focusing on economic growth now and the future is laughable.
5608 2018-11-17 19:06:08 Happy Founders Day to you all.... so now where the que oil at ? 
5609 2018-11-17 19:06:07 Тоже* 

Когда-то Т9 перестанет лезть куда не надо... Когда-то...
5610 2018-11-17 19:05:47 We need to "price" all these limitless renewables - add + them + together & compare with the "value" of untapped oil & gas reserves, often referred to as investment portfolio "ballast" by financial advisors. Let's see what's really worth more (even excluding FF's external costs.
5611 2018-11-17 19:05:45 it's unfortunate that notley has to be so bullish on oil & pipelines (literally can't get elected here if you're not) but the NDP has been a huge leap forward and breath of fresh air on LGBT issues
5612 2018-11-17 19:05:43 Some people will only patronize your hustle if you're from a certain social status 
5613 2018-11-17 19:05:38 Disagree. The Canadian oil/gas industry has plenty of resources to push back against anti-oil sands activists. Ask Viv how many comms advisors CAPP has on the West Coast. The answer is 1. He's invisible. If I'm attacked, I fight back. Oil CEOs whine. CAPP whines.
5614 2018-11-17 19:05:35 He literally was posting about snake oil a few weeks ago
5615 2018-11-17 19:05:31 But why even try to satisfy the Saudi Barbarians? We have more than enough of our own oil. And we shouldn’t be buddies with the real terrorists, the ones responsible for 9/11, for creating & funding AlQaeda and then ISIS, the ones w literally have no human rights, the Barbarians.
5616 2018-11-17 19:05:20 То же иногда такое бывает, но очень редко.
5617 2018-11-17 19:05:19 Постоянно
5618 2018-11-17 19:05:13 I would love more body oil.  I had a cucumber oil over the summer that had convinced me to buy more.  But there's no more!  Not even different scents.
5619 2018-11-17 19:04:48 My neighbour is a veteran on medical cannabis. He says he can't take Sativa-dominant products because his anxiety spikes. I, on the other, use sativa oil and shatter during daytime.
5620 2018-11-17 19:04:32 CreditforthisPartingThought: @ScottWesterfeld Plot idea: 97% of the world's scientists contrive an environmental crisis, but are exposed by a plucky band of billionaires & oil companies.
5621 2018-11-17 19:04:29 Government has to make this happen - right now only rich consumers can afford electric vehicles, roof-top solar, etc. Government has subsidized oil for over a century, stop doing that and put those funds toward renewables.
5622 2018-11-17 19:04:23 Changed the oil in my car and now contemplating if I want to rotate my tires.

5624 2018-11-17 19:04:15 “The occupant of the apartment where the fire started was heating oil to cook a meal before stepping out of the kitchen, investigators said. When the occupant discovered the grease had caught fire, she tried to extinguish it with water, which spread the fire.”

5626 2018-11-17 19:03:47 Waiting at the oil change spot, there's an old lady sitting next to me, and some of yall got smut going up and down my TL. You should be ashamed of yourselves.

*keeps scrolling with no pretense of shame*
5627 2018-11-17 19:03:41 Time to warm up the oil?
5628 2018-11-17 19:03:29 Real swagger though! Not fake snake oil salesman swagger!!
5629 2018-11-17 19:03:25 Yeah, that's what I thought. Conservatives and morality are like oil and water. Conservative parties all over the world are corrupt, because their voters don't care.
5630 2018-11-17 19:03:24 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
5631 2018-11-17 19:03:18 Well, I don't see it that way. I am reminded of a @ScottWesterfeld line: Plot idea: 97% of the world's scientists contrive an environmental crisis, but are exposed by a plucky band of billionaires & oil companies.
5632 2018-11-17 19:03:18 While I agree with you, charged with what? Being a dinosaur? Talking isn’t enough. But voting against this idjits ideology is a first great step in making sure his goes extinct. I will each & every time. Look,this oil-in-waiting contributes nothing to the common good, yet-wait...
5633 2018-11-17 19:03:14 I have. My position is from research. I have found too many influenced exclusively by todays $.  Found too many studies funded by big oil and Koch Bros.

5641 2018-11-17 19:02:11 Not sure how Scottish haggis could get palm oil, must be something in trades description (like whisky or Stilton)
5642 2018-11-17 19:02:07 I never said privatization is not a good idea , but it does not always work in all circumstance, especially in developing countries . The oil and gas sector is a capital intensive sector with the biggest risk indicator . You don’t just pull out the activity of govt .
5643 2018-11-17 19:02:05 Lmfaooo boy bought me a 12 pack of the coconut oil lipglosses cause I lose mine every other day 
5644 2018-11-17 19:02:04 Lol that one has muted me since 
5645 2018-11-17 19:01:56 And it has nothing to do with big money oil interests trying to protect their market share the same way the lead companies fought against banning leaded gas right?
5646 2018-11-17 19:01:36 What a delightful lil island.  Let's promote tourism to this savage place.  We can take an oil tanker to get there.

5655 2018-11-17 19:00:10 I don't understand the obsession to make Africa an investment destination for outside investors. Africa has always been an investment destination for the world except Africans themselves. From human trafficking to cotton to oil, investors have thrived. So stop calling them

5657 2018-11-17 19:00:01 And any Federal Government BN or PH dare to say to Kelantan and Terengganu that the Hajis dont know how to administer their state? ?Part of those Petronas billions rightfully belongs to those states where our Malaysia oil wealth is being pumped. No wonder those states are poor!
5658 2018-11-17 19:00:00 Get you some clove oil for the tooth ache ... & if the gummy bears start talking ... you've had too many.

5660 2018-11-17 18:59:53 buy Canadian oil..not middle east.
5661 2018-11-17 18:59:53 Sadly, Aaron, it's a bit like the oil price, very volatile and unpredictable fluctuations, typical of a destabilised system (as per the climate, and I'm sad there was no @novaramedia at the #ExtincitionRebellion ..... )

5666 2018-11-17 18:59:36 More learned chiropractors, ex-doctors (struck off for being utterly deceitful), and snake oil salesman. I don't consider not being a paranoid blowhard a loss. As for "idiot", no offense but I can't really be judged by you.
5667 2018-11-17 18:59:34 Let them raise the price of oil though. We will scream bloody murder.
5668 2018-11-17 18:59:32 i just saw a thing abt how boycotting palm oil isn’t beneficial at all bc it then creates a problem due to the increased amount of land needed to create other oils for the same amount u could get palm oil aNd ?????!!!!!
5669 2018-11-17 18:59:30 Sephora is having another VIB sale this weekend!! and I’m definitel getting the Drunk Elephant Sukari babyfacial & their Marula luxury oil 
5670 2018-11-17 18:59:28 If we stand firm with Buhari,  corruption will be dead,PDP said change the change,has anyone seen where oil is flushed from engine  & added back? No, a new oil will be added for the engine to run smooth, PMB don't even have an opponent, PDP were fooled during primary with money

5673 2018-11-17 18:59:02 It could hit $800.  If multi-lateral oil system keeps developing, USD oil will be at $8-20 when it does, & US Shale sector & US economy will be in severe trouble...

5676 2018-11-17 18:58:29 Just felt a quake in Santa Clara county. The planet is pissed off

Fracking, nuclear testing. Cutting down rainforests. Humans are the
Only species that will damage their

5679 2018-11-17 18:58:08 Headache? Nausea? Existential crisis? Alien abduction? I’ve got an essential oil combo to fix anything.
5680 2018-11-17 18:58:05 You guys keep pushing Sadia Arabia and they are going to start trading oil in other currencies and when that happens you will be paying 6 dollars a gallon like the Europeans are. So what they murdered the guy he was a scum bag. You want to lose the reserve currency status?
5681 2018-11-17 18:57:58 Corn = corn oil

5685 2018-11-17 18:57:41 My mechanic came to my job to pick up my car left a car for me to drive while he worked on my car and told me to come back for a free oil change.
5686 2018-11-17 18:57:23 It was very clear that you won't give Trump credit for using this episode to reduce oil price .It may not be to your liking as NAMO government got some breathing space
5687 2018-11-17 18:57:19 I'm dragging my feet on the storyline. I'm only in Chapter two and I just stole the oil wagon for Jon.

I really wanted a nose piercing tho and did it over w/ a helix, used the rubbing alcohol now its gone
5693 2018-11-17 18:56:36 Ok...I understand.
5694 2018-11-17 18:56:35 ...snake oil. This offsets risk for wealthy real estate investors, but doesn't pass that benefit on to smaller/individual investors whose risk is much greater. And that's without the concern of the real estate primaries lack of ethics/pulling a scam/not revealing all the info.
5695 2018-11-17 18:56:17 @Clicks_SA is not the right one to ask.
Ask the doctors to make 'findings' that will create a market.
The kind of research that exploded a market for gym clubs, canola oil, etc.
The kind findings that made us to buy water. Anything is possible.
5696 2018-11-17 18:56:15 Are you actually retarded?? The fact that capitalism encourages people to look at the monetary value of something instead of how it impacts the people is the MAIN issue here. IE health care, guns, oil, not switching to green energy AND fucking over poor people.
5697 2018-11-17 18:56:08 saying it like it is. Not much we can do, that won't come back and bite us in the butt.
It's a leader from another country. We going to go arrest him??? OK sanctions may feel good for while. They cut production and prices go up and we are stuck between and rock and an oil rig.
5698 2018-11-17 18:56:08 Hence why this country needs to revisit its fossil-fuel addiction at the hands of Saudi oil dealers. Besides this antiquated 20th century model of maintaining vassal states has had deleterious effects on US foreign policy as well as relations with our allies.
5699 2018-11-17 18:56:02 By cutting oil as an issue, we cut power from crazy people all over the world.  The Cartels collapse.  Transportation goes from airliners to private airplanes that go in garage.  Transit super cheap < 1 cent/mile.  Can't do it with current outdated tech.
5700 2018-11-17 18:55:58 please oil up your hairlines before sleeping , so you speak shit tomorrow with a full proper healthy hairline .
5701 2018-11-17 18:55:52 Try coconut oil too. Helps with memory. You can get it in capsule or take a tsp daily. Make sure you get non-gmo verified.

5703 2018-11-17 18:55:42 It is confirmed, it was in the article. But still... it's your livelihood?

Adobe is not responsible if you're careless. This is like blaming Toyota if you never change your oil.

What I can’t stand are hypocrites like you who use oil and oil related products and derivatives all day long, but want everyone else to bear the costs and risks of producing said oil. You can move
5715 2018-11-17 18:54:42 Do you drive a gas powered car, fly, use public transit, use anything made of plastic? Prime ingredient is oil.
5716 2018-11-17 18:54:38 If I could push a button I would push the 1200 PPM CO2 button.  We can't get there even if we burned all know reserves.  By cutting the oil, we cut the tax issue from the UN, and remove OIL as a backing for money (US dollar).  The end game is about 2-5% of current oil / person.
5717 2018-11-17 18:54:36 May God bless you my brother, may oil never run dey on ur head. Dis has been my advocacy. We change our legislation we change our country especially dat book - the constitution
5718 2018-11-17 18:54:19 Ca fait 40 ans que j'entends que le gaz oil c'est de la merde. On s'est foutu de la gueule des fournis écolos et nous voyons aujourd'hui pleurer les cigales #GiletsJaunes majoritairement poujadistes . Le poujadisme mène toujours au fascisme !
5719 2018-11-17 18:54:18 If California was a independent country the rest of USA is fucked, agriculture depends on them and oil in a few years. California is most beautiful state + google + apple + Hollywood + etc, etc 
5720 2018-11-17 18:54:15 I don't care too much about the % loss. I'm not exiting my holdings just sliming them down. The decisions to sell them down depends on the potential of the company and the proximity of the next significant milestone.
5721 2018-11-17 18:54:08 @CTilburyMakeup  can you tell me if you use palm oil in your products please? Trying to go #palmoilfree
5722 2018-11-17 18:54:07 This CON always accuses others of what HE HIMSELF is doing-in Spades .  How does anyone fall for it? And I STILL blame people like @maggieNYT who worked so HARD to normalize this stupid Snake Oil Salesman & his family.  Why is it Maggie never contributes to the RussiaStory?
5723 2018-11-17 18:54:00 I can’t wait for my tee tree oil and vitamin e oil to come through 
5724 2018-11-17 18:53:59 Cutting oil exports
5725 2018-11-17 18:53:50 there are 4 types of cards that you can accept in your Oman Oil Marketing Service Stations. 
5726 2018-11-17 18:53:39 ALL of your bread contains palm oil. NOT SOME PRODUCTS. Just stop.
5727 2018-11-17 18:53:39 Thank you  EOGB training for the course you ran this week and for helping Dean and Jordy to qualify as Oftec oil engineers, this adds to the three already trained engineers at the company. Many thanks once again 
5728 2018-11-17 18:53:38 “ don’t get it twisted sis , i wake to a head scarf and coconut oil. i’m married to a black queen “ 

OKAYYYY RANDALL 
5729 2018-11-17 18:53:33 I use hemp oil on my dry skin! It's amazing

5731 2018-11-17 18:53:07 Ребят, мне это начинает уже казаться странным.

Вы говорите иногда сами с собой? Типа, читаете Ростик какого-то твиттерского и потом просто резко вслух: "Ой, как жизненно", или "О, моя лапочка вернулась в тви".
Комментируете ли спонтанно фанфики, сериалы, мангу, аниме, книги?
5732 2018-11-17 18:53:07 The reality is no one knows, probably a lot longer. As much as we like to think we've got viable alternatives coming, we don't. All the panels and wind turbines in the world doesn't change that we need oil to make everything we need to sustain modern humanity.
5733 2018-11-17 18:52:56 Just dump everything in one heavy bottomed pot and cover until pasta is done. Toss in between so the pasta does not stick. One cup of Chardonnay is essential. Everything gets absorbed, and oil from sundried tomatoes coats pasta. Spinach mixed in at the end. Super easy.
5734 2018-11-17 18:52:48 Doesn’t matter. Stick to; just an oil change please!
5735 2018-11-17 18:52:43 Trouble is that Cuba is communist not socialist ... try voicing your own opinion there and see how long you are still walking free .. as for Venezuela ... all that oil money and still can’t provide loo paper ...
5736 2018-11-17 18:52:38 Lol I don't recall that I ever have. I'm not in favor of it. And you're referring to people who've mentioned CBD oil use, not smoking.
5737 2018-11-17 18:52:35 One issue was TransCanada was on the hook for environmental issues from every consumer that used their product. I don't  see Saudi oil Cartel having to meet the same criteria.
5738 2018-11-17 18:52:09 I'm worried about that. If everyone does that they'll produce sunflower and soybean oil instead and this takes up more land to produce. I don't think it's the answer..
5739 2018-11-17 18:52:06 US Military coming for you lol with all that oil
5740 2018-11-17 18:51:50 @dbongino Dan saw you suffer from bad arm joints try Life Extensions they have black Cumin Seed oil works great on my knees they are here in Florida Ed
5741 2018-11-17 18:51:50 I baked sponge cake with fate flour, baking powder, vinegar, oil, baking soda, and coconut milk. I added 15 g of desiccated coconut ( roast in a pan) to the lp cream. The exact proportions I can write you tomorrow if you interesting 
5742 2018-11-17 18:51:49 He must have got tired peddling his energy making bike at his off the grid home so couldn’t reply or his solar panels failed him. I would like to know how without the oil industry he thinks he would have his phone/computer & I am sure many other things he owns he would have?!
5743 2018-11-17 18:51:39 This will always be an ongoing pissing contest between all parties concerned.
But here we are talking about open water and CAN'T clean or contain.
West Coast is all narrow channels and straits where the oil would be to shore almost immediately.
Different scenarios altogether.
5744 2018-11-17 18:51:36 She pretty much only uses rapeseed oil.
5745 2018-11-17 18:51:31 Ha. Ha. Ha. $432+ because my brakes are damaged and I need an oil change That’s a whole ass concert ticket right there.
5746 2018-11-17 18:51:31 Kerosene is a byproduct of oil courtesy of dinosaurs millions of years ago...They are the ones to thank for going extinct.
5747 2018-11-17 18:51:22 #Aromatherapists - this isn't for a piece, but for personal info!  What aromatherapy oil would you recommend for calming. Want to try to help my 6 year old to chill out a bit more :)
5748 2018-11-17 18:51:22 I've heard Rosehip oil helps? I've never used it for that purpose so I can't vouch though.

5750 2018-11-17 18:51:02 I need dried mushrooms and oil tbh
5751 2018-11-17 18:50:58 We are used to politicians trading off a moral stance because of economic or political benefits. However, this is also for Trump and his family's personal enrichment. Besides, we can get along without SAs oil at this point.
5752 2018-11-17 18:50:50 You would been as well if there would be 60 jewish states controlling the oil supplies.

5755 2018-11-17 18:50:33 And I love lavender but can't even be around anything made with the oil. I break out in hives fast
5756 2018-11-17 18:50:26 Over 50,000 children died in Yemen last year, most from starvation, and the CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince ordered execution of Khashoggi.   We continue to buy Saudi oil, and sell them military equipment.  Proud to be Canadian.
5757 2018-11-17 18:50:08 Please explain how land rights, pipelines, infrastructure, and employees owned by five foreign entities will provide massive income to Canada. The lieberal govt is denying oil revenue to Canadians
5758 2018-11-17 18:49:54 Hi yall tonight for my 1st oil painting practice, I will follow a Bob Ross tutorial and I assure yall, this will be a disaster
5759 2018-11-17 18:49:53 I would like to say I enjoyed it but my impression is you will be sneaking out the back door. You said you would sell at a loss...what is your highest percentage you would sell at with a loss? Thank you.

5764 2018-11-17 18:49:26 it has it's pros & cons..That's why some people are turning to cbd oil, instead of smoking thc! 
5765 2018-11-17 18:49:23 i put an oil mixture on my scalp (olice, coconut, castor & almond), and use the african pride leave in conditioner & twisting cream and its a braid-out and just took it out this morning
5766 2018-11-17 18:49:23 Bama must’ve let momma Tua in @ halftime do to the whole team whatever she did to Tua’s knee in the med tent few weeks ago, probably anointing oil @LauraMRutledge @RickKarle @finebaum #mommatua #builtbybama
5767 2018-11-17 18:49:13 I use an oil free gas fryer.
5768 2018-11-17 18:49:11 And, their oil. Indonesia is an oil importer where they were once an active member of OPEC.
5769 2018-11-17 18:49:10 Bro: okay so this is an oil fire. Here's a bucket of water, what do you do?

Dave: duh I'm not dumb

Bro: so you know what to do?

Dave: of course I do

Dave: *sets down the water*

Bro: good, good.

Dave: *picks up the oil and proceeds to pour it into the water*

Bro: NO WAI
5770 2018-11-17 18:49:07 Pride and Bible are like water and oil,but if they go together the hypocrisy is Total.
5771 2018-11-17 18:49:05 Many refuse to submit to God's apostolic order, an Apostle as per first 200 years of the Early Church.  God changes not. No submission accordingly, no oil, no revelation. #llj #MissedTheMark #NoOil

5773 2018-11-17 18:48:58 Oil, gas, Hydro schemes combined with good fiscal probity gives Norway one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds $1Tn. We cant put any of that down to merely not being a full member of the EU.
5774 2018-11-17 18:48:43 97 is a we guy. Not a me guy.
5775 2018-11-17 18:48:22 Bryce Harper. I would not give him a dime over 10m. Why? Its not him. Its me. I think he isnt a player you build a frachise around. He is a Me guy. Not a We guy. Id rather a player who plays for we not for me.
5776 2018-11-17 18:48:22 The only thing that has helped my pain is CBD oil. I have a vape and a water soluble oil. I have a gene in my body that metabolises medication too fast so finding something was so hard, but CBD has been a lifesaver.
5777 2018-11-17 18:48:19 It's their democratic right to protest. Maybe if these huge companies paid their fare share of tax the burden wouldn't have to be passed on so much to the consumer. We in Britain have rolled over a long time ago so the utilities and oil industry know they can bleed us dry.
5778 2018-11-17 18:48:09 IF SHE WANTS HER OIL CHANGED SHES GUNNA GET HER OUL CHANGED OKUR
5779 2018-11-17 18:48:07 Lol I think it’s my white side .. but I really don’t do anything besides use do grow oil when I wash.
5780 2018-11-17 18:48:02 What do you want @realDonaldTrump to do? Cut off all ties with the Saudi’s and the price of oil go through the roof? Same people would blame @POTUS for high gas prices. It’s kind of a no win situation.
5781 2018-11-17 18:48:02 Yes!!! Eczema is a gut issue that manifests it self on the skin. So cbd oil helps it so much! Whenever she eats dairy she has a flare up, but when she is consistently on cbd oil she almost never has a flare up!
5782 2018-11-17 18:47:51 I added a drop of peppermint essential oil to my bong and holy shit it’s Christmas
5783 2018-11-17 18:47:47 lavender essential oil has saved my life 
5784 2018-11-17 18:47:39 Depends on how killy you want to get. Poison under kitchen cabinet units is effective. Peppermint oil in cotton wool balls in the corner of rooms is a good deterrent. If you like the place to smell of peppermint. Mice are cunts. Unfortunately for you, a cat is best.
5785 2018-11-17 18:47:37 Olive oil w pecans is surprising. See, I keep learning new things!
5786 2018-11-17 18:47:37 Hmmm... deregulation of the downstream sector of the Oil and Gas is the best way to go. However, I would really appreciate it if we had foreigners involved first before Nigerians come in.
5787 2018-11-17 18:47:22 Our 9/10 is huge so there will def be that question after because Murray is  the oil in our machine but.. it will tell us a lot about our wider squad because our squad was busted up at the last world cup and you have to be able to survive that.
5788 2018-11-17 18:47:18 Someone should go get my oil changed for me cause I really don’t feel like it!
5789 2018-11-17 18:47:16 Then why are Arabian countries all desperately trying to find alternatives to oil revenues?
5790 2018-11-17 18:47:15 If people didn't demand electricity, products, cars, gas, air-conditioning, heat, etc, they wouldn't be drilling, yet you blame the gov and oil companies. Look in the mirror.
5791 2018-11-17 18:47:11 So why’s it ok for you to carry one when searching for oil?
5792 2018-11-17 18:47:06 Trying to get an oil change while suffering through a headache and this valvoline has apparently never seen a drain plug like the one on our veedub. 
5793 2018-11-17 18:46:56 Utter bullshit, there is no appetite in the EU 27 for that to happen it;s just bullshit spouted by snake oil sales men.
5794 2018-11-17 18:46:54  I never oil my hair or anything just wash and go idk what even works in my hair cause I hate it
5795 2018-11-17 18:46:49 Have Iceland removed all their palm oil products? They talk a good game
5796 2018-11-17 18:46:41 OMG!  Homemade Dukkah.  Why haven't we made this before?  Bought yes, but never made fresh until tonight.  Toasted hazelnuts, sunflower, sesame, cumin, and coriander seeds, black peppercorns and sea salt; coarsely ground together. Great with fresh sourdough bread and hemp oil. 
5797 2018-11-17 18:46:39 You use CBD oil for eczema?!

5812 2018-11-17 18:45:17 Okay, so maybe taking triple my usual dose of fish oil supplements and then following it with a Starbucks latte and a Costco hotdog was a bad idea.
5813 2018-11-17 18:45:17 @hamzashafqaat have a heart please. I don’t ride a bike. But Your decision to stop fuelling stations from providing oil to motorcyclists  is tantamount to punishing stations owners for failures of traffic police. You are doing good job but it’s not the right recipe
5814 2018-11-17 18:45:12 I make my own with honey, black castor oil, greek yogurt and tea tree oil
5815 2018-11-17 18:45:10 If oil stays where it's at you can another 5 billion to that yearly number.
5816 2018-11-17 18:45:09 I did fine when I'd visit the mines in Vancouver oil sands in Alberta.
5817 2018-11-17 18:45:09 Hey I see she won a free oil change so that should make up for the debit card.

5819 2018-11-17 18:45:03 Agreed. Jason has always said this. I too like Larrson. But the trade was a bust. For Edmonton. The price we paid to bring in a legit dman was too high. Too many other bad moves by previous GM made it necessary. Petry. Then Fayne. Oi.
5820 2018-11-17 18:45:00 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

5822 2018-11-17 18:44:56 Newfoundland was over reliant on the fishery when it collapsed. Newfoundland had one oil boom . Alberta was always boom and bust but never plans for the next bust. Newfoundland was trying to dig out of a hole both in terms of finances and infrastructure unable to save for bust
5823 2018-11-17 18:44:50 What face oil do you use before it?
5824 2018-11-17 18:44:46 That's just it. If the offers aren't out there, the ask come down in a hurry. We have seen in baseball over the last couple of years & it'll continue to occur.
5825 2018-11-17 18:44:40 Then get over there and protest that Saudi oil!
5826 2018-11-17 18:44:40 A dab of raw coconut oil will get you right
5827 2018-11-17 18:44:39 well, they asked me if i wanted a car wash but i’m pretty sure they didn’t charge me for it. and the rest of the stuff they’re doing is complimentary with the oil change so???? we did buy a snickers and some cheezeits from the vending machine so i guess they got us
5828 2018-11-17 18:44:36 Then don't listen to them...but 98%of climate scientists worldwide agree it's real, Russia opened it's Arctic route to commercial shipping because the ice is receding and even oil companies agree it's real
5829 2018-11-17 18:44:35 Trump is weakening our enemies, China and Russia, significantly via economic strategy. Fair trade and oil respectively !!! Absolutely Brilliant!!

5840 2018-11-17 18:43:57 I was driving and listening to the trade broke while I was going thru Golden, BC... the rest of the trip to Calgary... there was a lot of frustration...
5841 2018-11-17 18:43:49 Spare capacity in  GCC Countries now around  1mn b/d  higher than in summer as temperature cools significantly. No oil supply shortage at sight. Prices could ease further. Earlier forecasts rather dramatic.
5842 2018-11-17 18:43:43 @cryptomarkets2 when is your next video? Please do one that combines oil and housing and what that means for Canada in 2019. The two main engines of growth now taking it on the chin.
5843 2018-11-17 18:43:36 Use black castor oil and aloe on them every night (brush them with a spoolie) to grow them back!! My eyelashes are so long now 
5844 2018-11-17 18:43:29 Awright, awright, awright. Lots of deferred maintenance on my beater got done this week. New muffler, new rocker arm, 4 wheel alignment, oil change, cleaned battery terminals, and sundry other things. That car has been ridden hard and put away wet.
5845 2018-11-17 18:43:16 Y'ALL I just remembered, in highschool I was smoking (vape) in a friend's room and there was smoke all over. She was freaking out because her dad come home, but I was prepared. I was 'straightening' my hair. I set the flat iron to the max, and put mega oil on my hair. (1/2)
5846 2018-11-17 18:43:16 Took my car to get an oil change and one of the mechanics hit my car with another customers’.
5847 2018-11-17 18:43:16 Hey @CadburyUK and @Nestle is there any chance you could make some chocolate bars without palm oil.

5850 2018-11-17 18:42:48 Love my Oil City Family!  Great season on your end as well! Go Oilers!
5851 2018-11-17 18:42:47 We can fight for clean energy without using racist dogwhistles to imply that the worst thing about oil is the fact that we have to associate with arab nations to get it. It’s not that hard to be an environmentalist without being racist

5854 2018-11-17 18:42:42 Drop dependence on Saudi oil. Stop selling Saudis weapons. Productive drone visit with MBS' limo, blame Russians.
5855 2018-11-17 18:42:38 Scotland has NO debt. Scottish Gov borrow zero. No defect. No debt. Scotland may choose to take some og ukunion debt. First we will work out who spent Scotland's oil money
5856 2018-11-17 18:42:37 I gotchu fam, it's called editing. Of the US had weapons like that we would use them to steal oil, not start fires.

5865 2018-11-17 18:42:11 Well thank you. You too.  I believe that Saudi sanctions are not part of climate issue. We can reduce carbon consumption, reduce reliance on fgn oil (pipe lines yes) and not harm cdns. Suite of policies needed.
5866 2018-11-17 18:42:06 It’s not just Vancouver, people are dying in almost every City and even on small towns. Shipping oil to China isn’t going to help that cause any, but providing safe & free opioids at safe injection sites will!
5867 2018-11-17 18:42:04 ...and in so doing Bill, laid the groundwork for the collapse of the energy industry of the nation. Do you think that oil companies in the US "need" the resources of Venezuela? Do you also think that Venezuela wasn't the biggest beneficiary of the US presence/expertise?

5872 2018-11-17 18:41:37 Irving oil will take every barrel refine  and use some and ship the rest to Europe. They already backed the Trans Canada Energy East andvthen Trudeau moved tyhe goalposts. Oh theyll build new refing capacity too.

5884 2018-11-17 18:40:47 One just has to look at oil and gas companies, gun manufacturers, auto manufacturers, etc. etc. etc. and examine the ways they and the dirty politicians they have bankrolled have fucked up the environment, low and middle income workers and socety in general.

5985 2018-11-17 18:31:18 I make soap and stopped using palm oil around 2 years ago. And the soap is just as lovely without it as it was with it. It’s unnecessary.

5988 2018-11-17 18:30:57 *facepalm*

No, Venezuela has had a lot of trouble as it focused on oil export, which America was not keen on so put economic pressure on it. And the ruling elite (Venezuelan equivalent of Mogg) also wanted to get control back so caused a lot of trouble.
5989 2018-11-17 18:30:57 Very simple actually. Slice lotus root, put salt, pepper and a little oil. Put it in the oven at 425 deg for 8-12 mins depending on how thick the slices are. Flip and another 8-12 mins and it's done!

5992 2018-11-17 18:30:30 Ryan was there for the subsidies he could rip from the American people and give to big oil giants like Exxon.... Ryan has 3 properties he rents to Exxon for drilling he put them in his wife’s name.  Conflict of interest!!!!
5993 2018-11-17 18:30:26 We finally have a chance to transform the destructive #palmoil industry from within. Tell global palm oil body @RSPOtweets to vote to stop certifying companies like @Indofood that exploit people and land for cheap palm oil in its NEW principles #RSPO #RT16

5996 2018-11-17 18:30:00 Used lol in a 7 days tweet because I imagine all normal tweets use lol to let people know they've done a banter. 

Now I've used it I'm going to drop my nut sack into a pan of boiling oil and think over my actions.

5998 2018-11-17 18:29:55 Stop buying Saudi oil.  Stop selling ours to the U.S. at a discount.  Refine and sell our own oil in Canada.

6006 2018-11-17 18:29:08 Yes, and those complex factors are what I am asking you to explain.

Also, I don't think many people realize the opportunity cost of the oil wars, in terms of time and money wasted and the connection to climate. I don't feel this was "hand wringing" so much as raising awareness.

6011 2018-11-17 18:28:44 Guys, while we are on the subject, my company @VivaRealEstate has 'a brand new Palm Oil Refinery for sale in Calabar'
6012 2018-11-17 18:28:29 :( I almost never have problems with oil. you farming a lot?
6013 2018-11-17 18:28:24 I don’t ignore that, all the oil exported in the U.S. doesn’t get produced in Texas, the Bakken play, etc.  You should debate Krause, she appears to have done the research, lots of press this week too.  You saw that?
6014 2018-11-17 18:28:14 Commodity oil prices down, French petrol prices up... ?

6016 2018-11-17 18:28:00 Please consider sustainable palm oil. It's so much better than the alternative oils.

6018 2018-11-17 18:27:53 Evidently, it is *you* who doesn't understand, "junior". Trump has (personal) *financial ties* to Saudi Arabia. They OWN him. The United States does NOT put fucking OIL or ARMS deals over the torture and *murder* of a resident, MUCH less an incompetent POTUS' PERSONAL wealth.

6027 2018-11-17 18:27:08 Unlikely. Not disproved, but unlikely. We know for a fact oil lamps were used by workers because we've got pictures of them, but mirrors... mmmm. The main issue is that to direct sunlight, there would have to be someone manning the mirror outside and turning it as the sun moved.

6029 2018-11-17 18:27:07 Chavez nationalised it and took it AWAY from American companies, this is why they are attacking Maduro, he wont give them access.
They did the same with Rousseff in Brazil, she wouldn't allow access, they had her impeached, put their own puppet, Temer, in, signed oil over.
6030 2018-11-17 18:27:05 Selling our assets may not be the best option due bad precedent. Again Nigeria is underdeveloped to allow market to play more role than the State in the economy. Need another roadmap on how you want to manage our oil wealth.

Just a quick note 
On 29th March 2019 Scotland will NOT be doing #Brexit as it's quite clear that Ur Govt will not be respecting promises made in 2014 4 Scotland 2 remain in the EU
Instead It's Independence
Good luck negotiating with an Oil rich country

Also the unicorn/rainbow/oil slick hair dye jobs are amaaaaazing
6036 2018-11-17 18:26:36 Drove around for an hour for no reason and I’m a little pissy about it  then I pull up to get an oil change, no cards or money.. I’m going back to sleep
6037 2018-11-17 18:26:34 I didn’t expect you to actually reply! I’m in Mexico, I’ve never heard of the tinted lip oil! I’ll look more into it! Thank you!
6038 2018-11-17 18:26:25 My car has been in for an oil change for an hour and I haven’t heard a thing. Nervous my phone battery will die! 
6039 2018-11-17 18:26:24 Good Point! But B.C. Tourism jobs are equally shared between both men and women whereas work camps in the oil patch are definitely not.
6040 2018-11-17 18:26:16 1) That's not true with a pigouvian tax.  The externality creates the deadweight loss which is corrected by the tax
2) No one is claiming it's a miracle.
3) Competitiveness impacts on oil sands and refining largely mitigated via OBAs. Avg cost changes are small.
6041 2018-11-17 18:26:10 DON'T BUY NABISCO PRODUCTS. They contain PALM OIL !! Put them out of Business
6042 2018-11-17 18:26:09 Is it possible that oil prices are lower instead of higher over Thanksgiving because the Saudis made a deal with Trump for killing journalist Khossoggi?
6043 2018-11-17 18:26:09 Ahhh that delightful aroma of neem oil 
6044 2018-11-17 18:26:06 The problem is you’re viewing this from the wrong angle.. The world needs oil - Fact - .. and there is a growing demand - Fact - .. Canadian oil has the highest standards ethically and environmentally- Fact -.. climate issue is a separate issue..we need to gradually find new ways

6046 2018-11-17 18:25:53 Including yourself, Jason. Don’t ignore the numerous times you supported the trade during the 16-17 season. Multiple mentions about how Larsson brought a much needed dimension and how the trade benefited the Oilers.

6048 2018-11-17 18:25:51 How much income has come in from Scottish oil in the last few years? Not a lot. Stop being so silly.
6049 2018-11-17 18:25:38 All interesting, thanks. It seems we agree on a lot. My initial tweet is fuelled (no pun) by me working towards the nuclear industry and my partner is in non-fuel oil. We care about the environment but feel like the bad guys because we see how it is on the shop floor, so to speak
6050 2018-11-17 18:25:34 Sure, walk away, but they had nothing internally to fill that void. Would’ve had to go to market and find someone who would’ve asked for the same $$$. 

Bargain-wise, I was suggesting Jan Rutta at the time. Was coming out of Czech, had a good year. EDM lost out to CHI in that one
6051 2018-11-17 18:25:30 I came to get an oil change not to buy a new car

6059 2018-11-17 18:25:04 We as in "cdn govts" don't buy oil - The Irving's buy Saudi oil in the East - They have said on many occaisons wouldn't necessarily buy western canadian oil, even if available.  Perhaps we should buy them out...have yet to see anyone in twitterverse give us a solution #cdnpoli
6060 2018-11-17 18:25:03 Let's say an American company made #Bangers to ship to England - the best that the colonies can make.  If it contains Olive oil, it must be registered appropriately as containing #EU ingredients.

However another company can use cheaper #CornOil and bypass the rules & added taxes

6063 2018-11-17 18:24:49 Scary!!! I did not post nor search anything about CBD oils. I talked about it with my son IN THE HOUSE - on my cell with my friend... and this morning I have all these emails about CBD     oil... WTH? Who's listening???????
6064 2018-11-17 18:24:39 Alabama is playing so low to their competition that they are finding oil.
6065 2018-11-17 18:24:32 True and you let him walk and go get another player. Their situation dictated it to be a rather obvious move

6077 2018-11-17 18:23:11 It’s the same as oil. When the price gets cheap they cut the supply so the demand goes up. In this case the price was already cheap on the black market so they trickle legal product out so the price stays high and they use their henchmen (the police) to round up the black market
6078 2018-11-17 18:23:06 Looking for the cooking oil
6079 2018-11-17 18:23:05 Get the damn pipelines built from coast 2 coast so that we’re able to export our oil to trade partners other than the USA, also bring those programs back that support kids so they have equal opportunities in this province, Forget the social conservatives they’re in the dark ages!

6084 2018-11-17 18:22:20 Fuck I’m hungover but moms needs an oil change so I got up and now I’m here just thinking about a michelada
6085 2018-11-17 18:22:19 In all honesty, the "still" part is what is so staggering. Unfortuantely in the eyes of many fans, liking Larsson & hating the trade isnt an option. And yet it is, as I was there the moment it was rumoured to happen & still reside there today 
6086 2018-11-17 18:22:16 $4M x 2YRS was something I suggested too, but I believe the sticking point was term for Russell who hadn’t had a long-term deal in his career. He was going to get $4M at market, believe TOR had an offer that put pressure on EDM to give Russell 4x4 otherwise they’d lose him to TOR
6087 2018-11-17 18:22:16 Do you still heat with oil? We have natgas. I haven't seen an oil delivery truck in the neighbourhood for a long time.

6110 2018-11-17 18:20:03 Oliver North picked to lead oil and gas lobby: reports.
6111 2018-11-17 18:20:00 I don’t think so. The NHLPA will make that a hill to die on, we might see shorter contract lengths (maybe to 5 yr max) before we see that.
6112 2018-11-17 18:19:53 Don't be an idiot. It's acidifying the ocean. CO2 is a natural part of the cycle, but when you keep adding more and more of it into the cycle by burning coal and oil, there will be consequences.

6117 2018-11-17 18:19:21 They forget the cost of their oil
6118 2018-11-17 18:19:16 And you are an idiot posting things without understanding the political back seen issues. Great get red of or weaken the crazy king with no plans and let’s see who ends up controlling some of the worlds best oil wells, don’t be a fool junior.
6119 2018-11-17 18:19:13 Dollar high. Oil low. Perfect recipe for disaster?
6120 2018-11-17 18:18:56 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
6121 2018-11-17 18:18:39 Nothing was or is funny about how many people did and/or still do support the Hall trade around here
6122 2018-11-17 18:18:38 U.S. is actually oil independent, and when we do buy oil its from Nigeria, we support Saudis because they opposed Iran, but Iran and Saudi Arabia are two sides of the same coin.
6123 2018-11-17 18:18:29 And, does Extinction Rebellion have a position on resource wars? Biggest polluters on earth are militaries. #ME #Yemen #Syria #oil #gas #minerals #uranium | #Israel #UK #US #FR #RU #CN
6124 2018-11-17 18:18:23 I was not one of them. At all. Ever. My twitter timeline would confirm that. I stand by that. We were not at a point in our teams development where we needed to trade Hall.
6125 2018-11-17 18:18:14 Not one thing wrong with medical.  cbd oil has no thc which is the chemical that makes u high
6126 2018-11-17 18:18:02 Like I said, “Percentage of cap” is an agents fav buzz word/phrase
6127 2018-11-17 18:17:59 As we choke on the worst air pollution on the planet Trump talks about firefighters who are now unable to stop the massive fires.  Raking up leaves and dropping fire retardant is like trying to empty ocean with a spoon.  Time to stop burning coal and oil. Use solar and wind now
6128 2018-11-17 18:17:56 Lost my earrings, a hoodie and my oil pen  how was your friday night

6132 2018-11-17 18:17:20 Umm... Diversify our energy industry away from a resource with economic disadvantages in the global market? Focus on energy self-sufficiency before spending billions on export to a market glutted with cheeper, closer oil alternatives? 4 billion funds a lot of green energy.
6133 2018-11-17 18:17:12 @senandikasenja hey baby oil! 
You must be asleep now. Sleep well kay?

P.s can you ans this for me?

6136 2018-11-17 18:16:43 The placebo effect.

He has nothing of worth to add, except whisky export duty that does not exist and complete ignorance of the Acquis Communautaire.

A snake oil salesmen has better medicine than the good doctor. 
6137 2018-11-17 18:16:19 Matthews is going to get $11M or more, nothing less.
6138 2018-11-17 18:16:16 All rests on the preparation. Roasted sprouts (salt pepper olive oil, finished with some good balsamic) are amazing. Though the memories of horrific boiled sprouts from childhood linger. @AntiqueThought likely has many ideas here.
6139 2018-11-17 18:16:14 honestly, i dont like cleansing oil. EWWWWW
6140 2018-11-17 18:16:07 I'm going to use a friend's roasted vegetable recipe, involves balsamic vinegar, olive oil, thyme, basil. Also calls for rosemary but don't really love rosemary. It will include tiny potatoes, carrots, broccoli, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and whatever else I find.
6141 2018-11-17 18:16:02 I think I’m just impatient. She just par boils, heats the oil in the oven and then puts them all in. They come out brilliantly. Potatoes always taste so much better when someone else makes them.
6142 2018-11-17 18:15:51 Yes , leave the oil in the ground!
6143 2018-11-17 18:15:51 the government also has their fingers in so many oil + coal company pies that they would never switch over bc of how much money they earn making their transit awful ]= BUT I KNOW IT WOULD BE SO GOOD

6145 2018-11-17 18:15:37 We don’t need to wear dog fur. Use oil.
6146 2018-11-17 18:15:35 Wowing us again, Oregon! What a gorgeous Fall day! Get out and play and come visit us at the Portland Saturday Market this weekend and try our new organic essential oil line! We'll be here until 5pm today and 4:30pm tomorrow in booth 913 in Ankeny Park!  #pdx #wellness
6147 2018-11-17 18:15:33 Again, just to clarify, I never said the deal for Draisaitl was bad. Player had to be compensated fairly in comparison to be the No. 2 best offensive player on the team.
6148 2018-11-17 18:15:31 Ma empty awo mdara,  malaitsha ngeke elengise I 20litre ele oil or petrol. Nice car. Ngicela ungiboleke for a week
6149 2018-11-17 18:15:30 Right but 8 mile plastic islands in the pacific and Caribbean is ok . Further there’s evidence everything we eat has small particles of plastic . Lastly talk to the indigenous people think about the oil leak on their land . Head in sand approach is a douche move
6150 2018-11-17 18:15:29 Trying to upload a video while waiting for my Jeep to finish its oil change and the WiFi here is terrible. It’s been two hours and I’m only at 26%. Someone help me.

6153 2018-11-17 18:15:08 It was about fuel duty after increases in Jan 18. Still cheaper overall than UK but with increases from world oil rates the French get a little passionate..

6156 2018-11-17 18:15:01 Even if establishment of Shariah or Nizame Mustafa is there, Tell me, Did people from other religions stop going to Arab countries because there's Shariah compliant law. What's the fear from it. I never see any Hindu saying NO to arabian oil because it's governed by Shariah.
6157 2018-11-17 18:14:58 I said - fewer impurities in the oil. Both right?
6158 2018-11-17 18:14:54 And all those 3rd party foreign financiers are donors to Liberals & bankroll groups that campaign against Conservatives...just saying...
And how do you justify $15 a barrel for Canadian oil while world markets pay $50-$80 a barrell for foreign oil?...just asking...
6159 2018-11-17 18:14:51 Got My Baby Fixed.!  Happy About That.!  Oil Change & Brake Pads Now.!
6160 2018-11-17 18:14:29 No it doesn’t, and in time as the cap rises, that number will be more digestible as well.
6161 2018-11-17 18:14:28 Trump just collapsed oil market..
6162 2018-11-17 18:14:21 Circa 55 years ago, my dad moved into a brand new town in South India. New development not many trees. Coconut oil rarely froze even in winter. 15-20 years oil froze over for some days in the winter. He attributed it to more vegetation and a much milder local climate 1/2
6163 2018-11-17 18:14:15 Oil price drops across the Country...Ford takes credit.
6164 2018-11-17 18:14:05 Do y’all ever get pissed off you have to be an adult and buy dumb shit like windshield wipers or oil changes? Bc same
6165 2018-11-17 18:13:42 Just doesn’t work within the teams cap structure to do that to Draisaitl which is why Liut/Chiarelli talks went on for as long as they did. Made sense for Draisaitl for why he got what he did.
6166 2018-11-17 18:13:37 -Getting troops out of Iraq

6170 2018-11-17 18:13:20 i like chicago loop bc it goes above usual roads ALSO the windows rattle bc the trains are so old and are still using oil and coal engines IF we were able to get electric trains or bullet trains the rides would be a lot smoother! bullet trains u can balance a penny on its side
6171 2018-11-17 18:13:20 Petrol price riots in France.
@Shell @BP_plc now charging almost £1.60 for diesil in UK.

When will we take on these parasite greedy oil companies?

When will our riots start?
6172 2018-11-17 18:13:13 Kudos to #Cowbell for #Cowbellpedia
Hope to see concepts in this direction by other companies... #peak #mtn #glo #etisalat #Banks #Oil_Firms
6173 2018-11-17 18:13:11 I swear, if a woman was to change the oil, there would be zero mess, but when a man changes it 
It's like deepwater horizon right now in my garage 
6174 2018-11-17 18:13:08 I’m sorry but you don’t get to sellout your own country to support a foreign big oil and not expect to get responses like these. This big oil campaign has cost many people their homes due to work stoppages, so although @MorattiJ put it pretty harsh, karma is a bitch
6175 2018-11-17 18:13:05 @marksandspencer I can't believe Marks & Spencers would still use palm oil when it has been proven that animals and forests are being lost to the cultivation of this product. Shocking, truly shocking
6176 2018-11-17 18:13:01 Can we not just tell the feds to pound sand, cut a deal with Ontario and build a pipeline. Drop some oil off in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, maybe even pick up some Saskatchewan oil on the way through. If we cant export at least let us freely move it inside our own country.
6177 2018-11-17 18:13:00 Still not sunk in that renewable energies will create far more jobs than oil. Less medical practitioners, though. Perhaps those are the job "losses" that worry you.
6178 2018-11-17 18:12:56 Last night I slipped on oil at work and almost snapped my ankle 
6179 2018-11-17 18:12:39 Are you sure?
6180 2018-11-17 18:12:29   well It's been an up and down 30 odd years for me. Looks like I've come through it all and will enjoy however long is left of this oil money 
6181 2018-11-17 18:12:18 and we can change the oil in your car in 3 minutes 
6182 2018-11-17 18:12:11 They day my gf does an oil change by herself, I’ll put a ring on it

6184 2018-11-17 18:11:47 they are in last place in eastern conference right now. They also had luxury of having top two C in NHL for a decade and then added another top-ten scorer. No other team had it. Edm could hav been close, but dumb trade cost them #4...funny enough many fans liked trade at time.
6185 2018-11-17 18:11:44 of those corporations that use a palm kernel oil, which is harder to obtain and is responsible for the greatest amount of corruption.  Palm kernel oil is used to make foods like ice cream softer & creamier.  So, I avoid any ice cream containing palm kernel oil.  A list exists.
6186 2018-11-17 18:11:39 wouldn't they dissolve in the oil
6187 2018-11-17 18:11:35 Coconut oil
6188 2018-11-17 18:11:32 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
6189 2018-11-17 18:11:30 I'm very disappointed that every brand of margarine at @Tesco has palm oil in it!
6190 2018-11-17 18:11:30 "Glue Sticks" by Good Earth are on sale! GG#1 oil, kief, and flower!
6191 2018-11-17 18:11:25 Job killing regulations, LMAO.
Regulations:
On banking practices (so Trump can get loans)
On killing endangered species
On clean air & water
On not digging for oil & other things needlessly

I don't see it as job killing, it's protecting the environment and the middle class
6192 2018-11-17 18:11:24 There are many variables with your statement. US is not drilling for oil sands product which is easier to access, have pipelines to move the product, refineries to process the product and access to ports. Blaming it on Trudeau, Notley is idiotic. Many Govt’s haven’t Done anything
6193 2018-11-17 18:11:18 Forte oil
6194 2018-11-17 18:11:15 I have to say these snake oil peddlers have to realize ppl are awake for the most part to their scams. This is embarrassing!
6195 2018-11-17 18:11:13 @OntarioPCParty The most important thing for Canada is to get our oil to market. It cost Canada over 6 billion dollars this year. The money went to America and Saudi Arabia. Imagine what that could have done for Canada's hospitals and social programs.
6196 2018-11-17 18:11:06 Exactly my thought. Nailed it. Why were we paying 3.2 for Strome? Optics. Thats all. Chia traded for him for cap relief. When it came time to walk away and save the money. He doubled down. Litertally.And now we have another project in Spooner. Just bcos.
6197 2018-11-17 18:10:59 World prices are very strong. Do simple research on oil prices before spouting non sense. Canada is only place in the world that is having such ridiculous low price.
6198 2018-11-17 18:10:46 Bill, you apparently forgot your hero Chavez nationalized the oil industry, so the big US companies ended up with assets in country seized, walked away, and now V's oil production and infrastructure are in tatters. Yeah, socialism works, as long as you don't have to live it...
6199 2018-11-17 18:10:42 #we_love_mbs

Anyone who believes that the greatness of the Saudi Arabian in its oil or money should review its information
Its greatness lies in the difficulties and challenges we have faced since the beginning of the foundation in 1901.
This is Saudi Arabia
6200 2018-11-17 18:10:28 Ya @JasonGregor I’m NOT saying Draisaitl is overpaid. Emphasis is on what I said about comparing compensation between top end players on same team. Not a great disparity, would be unjustified to pay McDavid $12.5M and then get Draisaitl to do what he does in EDM for say $6.6M.
6201 2018-11-17 18:10:23 The enemy of the @MYANC is @CyrilRamaphosa. You will never mix oil with water and @CyrilRamaphosa is trying to be best for both at the same he's hand is inside the stellenbosch cookie jar

6204 2018-11-17 18:10:05 Everyone who paid to watch this should get a certificate good for a free oil change.
6205 2018-11-17 18:10:03 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
6206 2018-11-17 18:10:03 just found out the kiehl’s midnight recovery oil only works if u put it on exactly at midnight :o
6207 2018-11-17 18:09:55 Oven backed broccolis  - a bit of olive oil, salt and a touch of black pepper 
6208 2018-11-17 18:09:55 I’m ready to be scolded by the people doing my oil change because I probably don’t have shit in my car 
6209 2018-11-17 18:09:50 We already had this discussion.  The U.S., I believe has increased their exports to 3MM barrels per day at some periods in the last year, Washington State alone has 5 oil refineries.  Which makes it even more comical when the the Gov of Washington state supports the TMX protests.
6210 2018-11-17 18:09:31 HAPPY FOUNDERS DAY TO MY FAVORITE QUES  @dlow32_ @FeelMySneakers @ThyKingP @TheyLoveTristen AND OSHUAN ! lol but yall have a GREAT day and drink HELLA OIL 
6211 2018-11-17 18:09:29 Slicker than oil 
6212 2018-11-17 18:09:26 Driving to Charleston, SC aka “Hipster Town” tomorrow for a concert and trying to decide what scarf to wear, which “flavor” of LaCroix I need to bathe in tonight, how many dabs of avocado oil is too much to wear as cologne. HOW DO YOU HIPSTER?
6213 2018-11-17 18:09:26 so they why say he was playing 5/6 minutes when he wasn't. Say "he did last game," would be accurate.
6214 2018-11-17 18:09:26 I keep blocking these accounts. You keep creating new ones to promote this snake oil.
6215 2018-11-17 18:09:23 And they will say, "all we wanted was the oil" . But we all know that it is a lie .
6216 2018-11-17 18:09:23 Eliminate fossil fuels from your life now, more insulation, heat pumps not oil or gas heat, electric vehicles and tools, solar panels, lobby politicians, get with the program or you are part of the problem #stopfossilfuels, #slowclimatechange
6217 2018-11-17 18:09:16 The Haitian People have had enough. I once read that Haiti has so many natural resources, that w/o the theft & plundering interference from foreigners, it w/b THE RICHEST COUNTRY in the Caribbean. Let that sink in. Hillary's brother got gold mining rights. The Bushes oil. & so on
6218 2018-11-17 18:09:08 Oil and vinegar, yes, that’s the healthiest, but my secret love is ranch!!  #closetranchlover
6219 2018-11-17 18:09:06 Have you been able to try the Aquaphor yet? It's great for overnight to heal chapped lips, then (for me) pretty much anything during the day. (Granted, Florida, so chapped lips aren't an issue like in other places.) Also, plain ol' coconut oil.
6220 2018-11-17 18:09:04 Maybe he is beginning to understand that blocking Canadian oil production just benefits Saudi Arabia and other oil producing nations? 
6221 2018-11-17 18:08:51 Following all. Thanks much for including me.
6222 2018-11-17 18:08:41 @JaguarUSA someday will car companies realize that poor design of their electric car model doesn’t help sales - just make the current models electric - easier, more sales, no more oil. #epace
6223 2018-11-17 18:08:38 I had to stop using coconut oil it made my cholesterol shoot through the roof!
6224 2018-11-17 18:08:35 I was going to put oil in my car & my dad said not to bc he’ll do it .... 
6225 2018-11-17 18:08:34 Simple! Sell NNPC, sell the OIL. Govt will start thinking, govt will diversified, govt will create jobs in other sector, the so called looting will stop because the only source of loot is OIL. These present govt yet to do any meaningful thing to get Nigeria working. What a shame!
6226 2018-11-17 18:08:24 40% of oil imports come from: Canada

0.96% come from:
 Saudi Arabia

6228 2018-11-17 18:08:16 not by cap % though..by a comparable...but can't just use the best case one...teams/agents use four or five...In a arbitration case both sides will often have four or five different ones for a total of 8. UFAs get overpaid. Always have, always will.
6229 2018-11-17 18:08:14 Hoy es Fuel Oil? 
6230 2018-11-17 18:08:09 Do you support Canadian oil workers? Or do you think we should keep buying Saudi blood oil?
6231 2018-11-17 18:08:07 @makaumutua Age is catching up with @salimlone going senile
Needs to be reminded that Saudi Arabia are second in oil imports to US (11%)
6232 2018-11-17 18:07:55 I need someone to oil my scalp 
6233 2018-11-17 18:07:51 Im the most stubborn person i know. I came to get an oil change in this weather... and i forgot buy coffee... anyone wanna bring me one lol im at gvr
6234 2018-11-17 18:07:51 Especially given Canada's economy is so petrol-driven and prices are lower than is suatainable already for the oil sands, which are much more costly to refine.
6235 2018-11-17 18:07:45 Im listening to Justin Waite's podcast.
6236 2018-11-17 18:07:39 Yeah hahaha they cook in peanut oil & is allergic to peanuts !

6241 2018-11-17 18:07:17 Stats dont lie.
6242 2018-11-17 18:07:13 I know that. But when you are already long oil, because you are an oil rich country, you shouldn't add to your long position, but cut your long deltas by selling calls.
6243 2018-11-17 18:07:02 Can we stop calling it “traditional Chinese medicine”?  How about debunked primitive supplement.  Snake oil is not “traditional western medicine”.
6244 2018-11-17 18:07:01 You know it’s a cold day in Florida when your coconut oil isn’t melted
6245 2018-11-17 18:07:00 It’s sad.  I have a closet full of clothes.  I do my own hair. Cut and color. I use vet e oil instead of expensive face creams. I cut my hubs hair and beard  he just bought $100 worth of food, paid $40. BOGOs and coupons.

6247 2018-11-17 18:06:49 I’m literally forcing myself to get my nails done and get an oil change
6248 2018-11-17 18:06:38 Let's see what oil can buy.
6249 2018-11-17 18:06:36 you realize many teams have rookies in bottom six. How much worse is Marody than Strome? Won't be hard to match his offence.

Produkten är gjord på ockuperad mark i Palestina och ett bättre alternativ är Nashi Oil!!!!!!!!
6253 2018-11-17 18:06:02 Of the 18 GP this season for Russell:

15/18 games he played 18:00 or more.

So no, a lot of the time he’s being played Top 4 mins vs 5-6D mins.
6254 2018-11-17 18:05:57 I only clean the strings & fretboard after I play ... the body gets cleaned with each string change (Lemon oil on the fretboard too)
6255 2018-11-17 18:05:57 Pay salary under your PhD holder president who can't differentiate between corruption and stealing. How much was crude oil at the international market during looters party club? We already knew that elites are the problem of this administration. Many of them are mis-educated.
6256 2018-11-17 18:05:50 Really, you don't know Aliko Oil?
6257 2018-11-17 18:05:47 Harper would be too busy trying to get our oil to tidewater, get tariffs removed and actually run the country. This is just BS on account of some drama teacher acting like a prime minister in a cbc 22 minutes comedy skit. It's like his whole political agenda is written by 22 mins
6258 2018-11-17 18:05:46 Any of my twitter fam like CBD oil? The stuff seems to really work well for me... 
How do you guys like it???
6259 2018-11-17 18:05:42 Or if the GM's are smart, they can be used to deflate. Though as we all know, that's an awfully big if 
6260 2018-11-17 18:05:42 Well, that was fun. Took 25 minutes to get 2 gallons of lemonade from Chick-fil-A, then a guy at Kroger asked me if I worked there and if I knew where peanut oil was. He seemed pretty disappointed that I did not
6261 2018-11-17 18:05:30 Dem oil spills and nukes have fucked up things even more. I can't really agree with you though. My country is surrounded by ocean, so I'm chill with it (Don't want that motherfucker to swallow the whole shit)
6262 2018-11-17 18:05:29 It was out of step with the market at the time it was signed. RFAs are usually underpaid relative to UFAs, so even an overpay relative to other RFAs can still be 'worth it'.
6263 2018-11-17 18:05:27 How would we pay for your welfare? Oil production is just displaced while massively hurting Canada's economy. Even Canada's foreign oil imports have risen during last few years. I suggest Sir you live off the grid or at least stop driving.
6264 2018-11-17 18:05:10 Loooooool bruhh ak sunj oil b yepp,we’re talking about a million each
6265 2018-11-17 18:05:02 Talking sense into you and your people (the dems and libs) is like mixing oil into water.

We work very hard to achieve no lasting results with you people.
6266 2018-11-17 18:04:56 Oil is getting more expensive, +40 cts/liter including 7 cts of taxes. People are protesting against a 7ct/l tax. There's also the context of Macron's fiscal policy being veerry unfair
6267 2018-11-17 18:04:55 There should be no political parties. People should run on what they believe and will do not fear mongering. People used to hold these positions out of civic duty. Now they’re for sale and bought by Oil Companies, the NRA, and even the medical and pharmaceutical companies.
6268 2018-11-17 18:04:48 Move to the already ruined Gulf Coast if you like oil so much. We elected @RepSanfordSC to stand against this, and when the fanatics picked Arrington, we elected @JoeCunninghamSC. Historically the anti-drilling message stands in the Lowcountry.
6269 2018-11-17 18:04:36 Russell has played top 4 every game but the first of season and last game. He has played 30 fewer minutes than Larsson all season. If Benning continues to play well Russell will play less in 3rd pair, but to date has been consistently in top four.
6270 2018-11-17 18:04:35 I know, let's resuscitate the Shah of Iran and have the CIA put him in charge there.
DIscussion of American oil policy makes me sarcastic.
6271 2018-11-17 18:04:23 ... amid elevated uncertainties related to Iran, Venezuela and the likes. But medium to longer-term, we‘ll have more than enough oil.
6272 2018-11-17 18:04:21 4 - 3 Oil OT lol
6273 2018-11-17 18:04:12 ha memory! that sounds familiar, I can report tho that Coconut Oil, Vitamin B-complex & turmeric are all marvellous and rapid memory boosters - As i Essential oil Rosemary although I personally haven't experienced that yet!
6274 2018-11-17 18:04:11 これが檸檬さんだったら私は寝れないところだったなっ( ˘ω˘)
6275 2018-11-17 18:04:06 imho @facebook is to social media as BP is to oil rigs.
6276 2018-11-17 18:04:00 I suggest a lip oil or just really good lip balm bc girl it be DRY but its cute we make sacrifices
6277 2018-11-17 18:03:59 Yes, we purposely dump raw sewage into our waterways, but if there is an"accident" with crude oil your upset.I wonder just how much oil and gas seeps from the ocean bottom on a daily basis from natural occurrences ?Climb down off your tall pony and use some logic and common sense
6278 2018-11-17 18:03:59 I was going go Black Friday shopping this year buttt now my car needs an oil change, new tires and the registration and payment is due 
6279 2018-11-17 18:03:56 Lool man... There is nothing that the woman cld have said or done to justify being stabbed... Not even threatenin to heat up cooking oil and pour it on him!
6280 2018-11-17 18:03:50 I love smelling like Shea butter and coconut oil 
6281 2018-11-17 18:03:48 @Ocado just edited my Christmas shop to REMOVE some products- food and brands will remain name less.

Why? Palm oil! 

Yes the ad provoked my thoughts BUT made me think even more about WHAT is in my food.
Thank you for showing ingredients online #nopalmoilinmyshop
6282 2018-11-17 18:03:41 Agree. We are 20 games in and Cooper Marody is going to be our 3rd line center. Had you let Strome walk this summer. You would have 2.2 cap space available. Chias asset management is like a game of bingo.
6283 2018-11-17 18:03:36 For sure but for us to suggest Leon's deal is a bad one, is a stretch. He puts up points, has shown capable of driving a line but keeps getting shifted around b/c of the roster construction. That's not on him.
6284 2018-11-17 18:03:33 Or some CBD oil for relaxation.. 
6285 2018-11-17 18:03:31 Get ready to take on the world by using our limited edition Christmas Citrus soap! You can be as cheery and bright as Chelsea if you wash up with this mood boosting mixture of lemon juice zesty lime oil. 
6286 2018-11-17 18:03:24 Naked selling $oil or $natgas would do the trick. Any size get wiped out.
6287 2018-11-17 18:03:17 Applying mustard oil mixed with a little water on the crown f da head cools nerves.
6288 2018-11-17 18:03:14 Fair point. The past couple of days were absolutely exceptional for natural gas. But that market is much more volatile than oil and has been genuinely tight. As I said, short-term price risks are skewed to the upside...
6289 2018-11-17 18:03:11 may oil ka ba?
6290 2018-11-17 18:03:02 FIG. E (plate, page 77) from TWENTY INCH SQUARE
A. Andreevich Zverev
Oil on canvas with milk glass on cast porcelain
6291 2018-11-17 18:02:58 Short-term impacts from crashing oil prices have a bigger impact than government's long-term impact through policy.
6292 2018-11-17 18:02:55 I’ve been at the dealership for FOUR hours. How long does it take to change some oil and a light bulb 
6293 2018-11-17 18:02:33 นี่ตะโกนจนเสียงแหบ ลานมันโล่งอ่ะ เหมือนไม่ได้ยินเสียงตัวเอง เสียงเบากัวผัวน้อยใจ ผัวก็ดั๊นมาถอดเสื้อตอนจะบอกรัก เลยกรี๊ดจนเสียงแหบ นึกว่าจะได้ดูขนแขน ป๊าว ใส่แขนยาวอีกชั้น
6294 2018-11-17 18:02:32 Apparently, I'm going to need to purchase product to rub in me beard. 

Beard Oil.............who knew !
6295 2018-11-17 18:02:23 Tea Tree oil is the secret toe everything
6296 2018-11-17 18:01:34 Oil change 
6297 2018-11-17 18:01:33 Finalement je change d'avis sur les gilets jaunes on est vraiment trop taxés. Oui à l'arrêt des aides sociales familiales et logement, oui à l'arrêt des indemnités chômage ou retraite et j'en passe....
Le gaz oil à 0.50€ et les autoroutes gratuites et sans radars. La vie quoi?
6298 2018-11-17 18:01:26 Getting oil changes alone is on my list of things that make me the most uncomfortable
6299 2018-11-17 18:01:15 @RailwaySeva @drm_kir Sir NJP rly station ka parking se nikalte huye NJP RLY Hospital tak jo road hai uhapar road ka dono side 24 hrs truck,  Oil tank se road closed raheta hai. rat 7 8 baje ka bad road ka bichme hi parking karke rakhta hai. Rail yatri ko paresani hota hai.
6300 2018-11-17 18:01:09 Went to Firestone for an oil change and they told me my engine was knocking, needed oil, likely severely damaged, and they refused to do the oil change. Went to VW dealership yesterday they did the oil change and nothing is wrong with the engine 
6301 2018-11-17 18:01:02 Why aren’t you in Blackpool protesting Fracking and the destruction of our water supply. Oh yes your all funded by big oil and UN agenda 2025 or is it 2050 now.
6302 2018-11-17 18:00:57 Super Lube on Tharpe doing oil changes for half off today
6303 2018-11-17 18:00:57 Pipelines have nothing to do with the price of Canadian heavy oil. It’s a lower quality product that takes time and money to refine.
6304 2018-11-17 18:00:56 Some Canadians are ok with importing oil from these savages. We should run headchopping videos at gas pumps
6305 2018-11-17 18:00:45 Take Vancouver for example; Jay Beagle & Antoine Roussel both got $3M x 4YRS... you can bet that’s going to be used to inflat costs for 4th line vets who feel they can push into 3rd line from time to time..
6306 2018-11-17 18:00:31 Hurricane Watcher:

3)"First there was acid rain, then the greenhouse effect, followed by global warming and "peak oil." (We now know there is plenty of accessible oil and gas in the earth.) Each time a narrative and its label stopped working, a new term was coined."
6307 2018-11-17 18:00:29 The D thing is unforgivable and all due to poor asset management
6308 2018-11-17 18:00:24 I'd say that fossil fuel interests, from coal unions to oil&gas multis, were a big factor in reprogramming environmental organisations into anti-nuclear organisations. Fantastic if you can get your critics to fight your only  competition!
6309 2018-11-17 18:00:22 Don’t be hating on us dark brothas!! We are the oil that makes the world go round and round...
6310 2018-11-17 18:00:19 Chakula ya kuku na V$A unahara oil
6311 2018-11-17 18:00:15 Anyone else miss the CNBC announcers? They're giving us updates on the Alabama game instead of updates on oil futures. #TheGame
6312 2018-11-17 18:00:12 Afaik sundar pichai is an American citizen. India didn't bypass US sanctions, india has reduced Iran oil consumption and increased us and Saudi consumption. Public RTI handle ka naam hai matlab kuch bhi bakoge kya.
6313 2018-11-17 18:00:08 How much is the oil
6314 2018-11-17 18:00:06  Today #wti #crude #oil price:

6316 2018-11-17 18:00:04 Sorry what direction is the rest of the world moving in?  Provide some stats.  Oil consumption is up worldwide.
6317 2018-11-17 18:00:02 Hakuna zvakadaro  mvura ne oil hazvisangane, ZANU yakauraya vanhu veMDC vakawandisa.

6319 2018-11-17 17:59:59 Not a good situation, but just FYI, this is an oil tanker loading from an offshore oil rig.  Not the same, and much riskier, than what will be happening on the west coast.
6320 2018-11-17 17:59:54 잘깍
6321 2018-11-17 17:59:52 You never KNOW with absolute certainty, that doesn't mean every long term deal cant be assessed.
6322 2018-11-17 17:59:48 Lavender oil splashed on the walls before you take a shower, lavender oil in an oil diffuser, nature sounds app if you like the sound of rain & such, wine &/or weed, or liquid nighttime aid.
6323 2018-11-17 17:59:38 The qualm of my life. Aquaphor or coconut oil does the trick for me!
6324 2018-11-17 17:59:37 Ill agree. Yet there are nights he plays 5/6 minutes a lot of the time. Nurse/ Benning as our 3/4.
6325 2018-11-17 17:59:36 Bio oil was the biggest lie of our generation
6326 2018-11-17 17:59:09 Do some math here.  Oil was at 12$ yesterday per barrel.   We are still paying over 1$ per litre for gas.  There’s 205 litres of oil in a barrel. Someone is getting royally fucked here!
6327 2018-11-17 17:58:57 South Sudanese (National) Petroleum Engineer and Drilling Engineer are not needed by Chinese oil companies in South Sudan only Geologist.

6329 2018-11-17 17:58:50 1. Always double cleanse
2. Always use acid toner: salycilic or glycolic
3. Eyecream
4. Spend most of yr £ on serum/treatment oil
5. Then Moisturise

No foaming cleanser shit
Fresh flannel AM/PM
Caroline has great Cheat Sheets on her magnificent blog
Also,a no-nonsense YT channel
6330 2018-11-17 17:58:35 ALSO peppermint oil is good for running on your temples when you have a headache
6331 2018-11-17 17:58:34 How can you be a guy and not know how to do a oil change
6332 2018-11-17 17:58:25 Just don’t cook it with any animal products, or with oil, both of which are unhealthy for humans...
6333 2018-11-17 17:58:14 Exactly. Were not Chias words this past week an indictment on this contract alone. We dont have enough dmen who can move the puck?
6334 2018-11-17 17:58:04 Victoria BC spews its brown sewage directly into the Pacific. Victoria, BC is the hub for Save The Whales environmentalists.  This hypocrisy tells me that this is really just the ploy of US/Saudi Anti-Canadian Oil mongers.  They care less about Whales, only oil production.
6335 2018-11-17 17:58:01 after watching kj use olive oil instead of vegetable oil in her brownies assured that she will NOT be cooking for this team challenge #thekjchronicles
6336 2018-11-17 17:58:00 "To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified." Isaiah 61:3 KJV
6337 2018-11-17 17:57:52 How did the govt "make" us use oil and gas?  Plants?  Not sure what your talking about here.
6338 2018-11-17 17:57:38 That black castor oil gone get ya waves right trust me if you want that healthy look
6339 2018-11-17 17:57:37 We are donating a Car Care package for the Kim & Ron Werger benefit going on today! The package includes an oil change, tire rotation, exterior and interior detail, a value of over $200.
6340 2018-11-17 17:57:28 Oh fuck I'm no oil painting but even ide stand a chance on a night out with him.
6341 2018-11-17 17:57:26 “Percentage of cap space” is an agent’s buzz word that’s caught on. They love that argument because the numbers always fall in their favour with that assessment. Russell makes closer to 4D $$$$ than he does 3D $$$
6342 2018-11-17 17:57:11 That’s why I said get an oil that works for you. I have a dog and I don’t fancy lavender. I prefer clove to help me sleep. But it’s all about what oil(s) works for you. The same oil may calm one person and the next person it invigorates.
6343 2018-11-17 17:57:02 @PalmOilFarmer shame on you. I will never buy a product with palm oil in it again.
6344 2018-11-17 17:57:02 Which is the whole point, we dont know & I get why they went the route they did.
6345 2018-11-17 17:56:57 Woke up, got my hair cut, oil changed, and grocery shopped all before 10:00 am.
6346 2018-11-17 17:56:57 The @Jeep is all vacuumed & shampooed, air in the tires, full tank of gas, & a fresh oil change my baby's spoiled  #jeeplife #wrangler #sahara
6347 2018-11-17 17:56:43 the usa will never let canada biuld any pipelines they are making billions reselling are oil as there crude lol.
6348 2018-11-17 17:56:40 just stop buying oil products
6349 2018-11-17 17:56:21 Alberta Party calls for province to curtail oil output due to low prices. 
It says output should be cut based on a % of each firm’s production. #ableg #yyc #yeg
6350 2018-11-17 17:55:54 We’ve found that flaxseed oil produces seasoning that can be brittle and prone to flaking.
6351 2018-11-17 17:55:53 This. Speaks volumes about Chia.
6352 2018-11-17 17:55:51 So let me explain why the Iraq war can be partly explained to capitalism
70s you have the OPEC Oil crisis. The OPEC Oil Crisis was one of the key catalysts to forming the New Right.
The US wanted to have the capability to not get fucked by oil OPEC by getting a seat at the table
6353 2018-11-17 17:55:50 Because oil and gas companies have vested interest in peddling the idea that climate change happens because of individual failures rather than systematic ones they caused and we shouldn't play their game?
6354 2018-11-17 17:55:46 Argh! @marksandspencer I would love to buy your dark choc Jaffa cakes, but have seen they contain palm oil in them?! No!! Please make a change ... it’s spoiling the environment for beautiful orangutans and is unethical 
6355 2018-11-17 17:55:32 If they're paying a guy $4M per for four years b/c of blocked shots, someone in the front office needs to have their heads examined
6356 2018-11-17 17:55:26 I would have walked away from the deal. Term at 4 years was too rich for me. And with Lucic trending to buyout next season its hamstrung our team even more so. Sekera on 1 leg. Literally. Who's thinking he is anything more than a 5/6 dman if he plays again?
6357 2018-11-17 17:55:21 가지는 별로
6358 2018-11-17 17:55:07 Randomly watching the Maryland/OSU game while getting my oil changed and Maryland's RB is straight up carving OSU's defense.
6359 2018-11-17 17:54:54 He has oil
6360 2018-11-17 17:54:45 Of course preventing massive fires, floods and windstorms would be best. But Trump chooses to burn coal, gas and oil instead of using solar and wind power. Trump will be remembered for destroying civilization.  #GreenNewDeal
6361 2018-11-17 17:54:42 I so agree. I have a fake fireplace, no fire. The central heating is off. If it ever gets ‘cold’, I put on a cardigan. And I have a antique portable Valor heater the runs on oil when it really gets cold. But I am afraid that is not going to happen. So I sit at my fake fireplace.
6362 2018-11-17 17:54:37 How about the lost tourism revenue that will be the result? Don’t even consider this, we don’t want it! Oil is yesterday’s technology.
6363 2018-11-17 17:54:33 Flower seed oil bukan? Yg seed seed gitu lah. Aku ada nih, mau?
6364 2018-11-17 17:54:32 My new oil moisturizer makes me smell like marzipan?
6365 2018-11-17 17:54:32 The oil I see in that soup can be used to cook another pot of soup
6366 2018-11-17 17:54:28 Oil is best on your body not in it 
6367 2018-11-17 17:54:11 Come and have a taste this is beyond palm oil mam
6368 2018-11-17 17:54:08 버섯은 맛있지...
6369 2018-11-17 17:53:44 Sure but both sides wanted term
6370 2018-11-17 17:53:40 Venezuela: Oil Exporter

Venezuela: Socialist Government

Venezuela: Refused to reform oil industry 
Nigeria: Refused to reform oil industry 

Venezuela: Amass huge foreign debt

6371 2018-11-17 17:53:34 Now do how many billions are given in subsidies to Oil companies that post record earnings and profits year over  year.
6372 2018-11-17 17:53:29 @nielsonTSN1260 Dusty should the Oil take a chance on Schenn?
6373 2018-11-17 17:53:17 for hydrating and moisturizing i use the ordinary's marine hyaluronic + their rosehip oil and use cosrx's ultra moisturizing lotion to seal the moisture in which you know..  should be enough especially since i dont have dry skin fjdjd but my skin is still irritated bc of the cold
6374 2018-11-17 17:53:12 I need gas pumped oil changed and a kidney rotation. This is too much
6375 2018-11-17 17:53:03 ^ This

(ProTip: If you're not already, and you're not allergic, start taking fish oil pills (Omega 3's...etc), and work anti-inflammatory foods into your diet while reducing foods that cause water retention/swelling. It'll reduce these issues and offset them by a decade or two.)
6376 2018-11-17 17:52:36 I’m a Torontonian and I feel for you. Many many here feel for you and our country. Why are we still buying Saudi oil and bringing it in by tanker ships? THAT is ok with Canadian environmentalists? @cathmckenna @JustinTrudeau @ElizabethMay Crickets.  #Cdnpoli #canpoli
6377 2018-11-17 17:52:35 I truly can’t stress this enough but, if you like rose hip seed oil, please look into chia seed oil. This girl has considerably calmed down a rosacea flare up and hormonal breakout and I! Am! Grateful!
6378 2018-11-17 17:52:33 it probably doesnt "suck" to be him, as you so eloquently wrote. Consider the economy is doing well, peace treaty with n korea, goodbye tpp, better nafta deal, protecting American manufacturing, record u.s. gas and oil production, low energy prices, not letting illegals stroll in
6379 2018-11-17 17:52:30 갈릴레오 갈릴레오 갈릴레오 피카로
6380 2018-11-17 17:52:25 Sekera has been injury related & that's not on the club or player. The issue with Russell was when it was handed out, consideng they were already looking at being in a tight spot b/c of Lucic & big boys starting to make $$$.
6381 2018-11-17 17:52:21 Don’t love Oreo, they destroy rainforests to make their products. Stop buying until they ditch palm oil
6382 2018-11-17 17:52:16 Especially TML. If they paid him less than 97 the media would explode in TO.
6383 2018-11-17 17:52:06 Who owns a essential oil diffuser?? Does it work?
6384 2018-11-17 17:51:44 And I dont really know that he would cost more than 8.5M long term if a deal needed to be signed next summer.
6385 2018-11-17 17:51:43 Jade I work in the industry as a geologist and everywhere else oil & gas recovered and booming again, US is drilling & getting new project. Oil companies leaving Canada because of our policies and government. Nothing to do with oil pricing globally.
6386 2018-11-17 17:51:34 Yeah? So?  And Planned Parenthood spends millions lobbying for abortions, and oil companies lobby for expanded drilling, what’s your point?
6387 2018-11-17 17:51:33 taking matte lipstick off at the end of the day and slathering oil and lip balm on is an erotic experience
6388 2018-11-17 17:51:25 Aku kasih baby oil nder. Dia mengurangi rasa sakitnya dan bisa sembuhin juga di akunya
6389 2018-11-17 17:51:24 When I criticized @herbivorebeauty for their hemp seed oil product on Broccoli Mag page, I was impressed by the owner coming out with her own cannabis story. It’s unfortunate they did not lead with that in their marketing. At least she had a story to tell.
6390 2018-11-17 17:51:21 Hi. 1970 called, they want their Peak Oil theories back.
6391 2018-11-17 17:51:16 They don’t want to pay for counsel either though. I suppose it depends on how hardassed the LL wants to be.
6392 2018-11-17 17:51:16 Trump loves the Crown Prince and oil. No Way will he side with America.
6393 2018-11-17 17:51:15 Looks delicious. I see rosemary and some oil on the skin. Did you marinate it first?
6394 2018-11-17 17:51:08 Liberals ran on a campaign of 'oil can wait' and proceeded to put as many hurdles in the way as possible, even when they have the authority to make this right.  They have no moral authority to destroy peoples lives - but they do anyhow. Pure Insanity!
6395 2018-11-17 17:51:04 Absolutely. How I felt about the Strome contract. The Kassian contract.
6396 2018-11-17 17:51:04 If you think socks are good ...try rubbing cannabis oil on your clit ....you'll thank me multible times ...
6397 2018-11-17 17:50:59 Muller was just an obedient functionary for Bush & Cheney, that obviously lied to go to war.

Muller would have known the real reason for going to war with Iraq, was Saddam selling Iraqi oil in Euros.

Muller absolutely knew the real reason for the Iraq War.
Muller lied for Bush.
6398 2018-11-17 17:50:56 Definitely disappointed that tea tree oil didn’t work for me. But the Holy Basil definitely is.

6401 2018-11-17 17:50:28 Oil the spoon
6402 2018-11-17 17:50:19 I honestly don’t know my facts on oil I just think what we got going on now is good. Cars are going electric and soon everything will fallow a pipeline is almost an investment that should have been done in the past not the future is just how I see it
6403 2018-11-17 17:50:12 It’s too melted now smh it’ll take all day to solidify so fuck it  I got the beard oil
6404 2018-11-17 17:50:06 I don't need speculation for that. I'm from Germany, For us all those people on the battlefield of early RTS were robots. You could hear the crunched metal bits under tanks and you could see the black oil spills everywhere.

6407 2018-11-17 17:49:48 It doesn’t take long to make, almond butter is now done. This is only almonds. Nothing was added. The oil from the almonds is what made it smooth.
6408 2018-11-17 17:49:41 Might fuck around and try to change the oil on the G35
6409 2018-11-17 17:49:39 Sure but your paying a premium a few things with Russell:

1. Health - guy hasn’t missed just 18GP over the past 3 seasons with Oilers

2. Shotblocks - Leads EDM by a country mile in shot blocks since 16/17 (488), and closest player to him in NHL since then is Alec Martinez (418)
6410 2018-11-17 17:49:36 I need some lavender essential oil 
6411 2018-11-17 17:49:23 My brother is the worst. He had my moms car for two months but now I  need it.. two months.. brings it back with NO gas and 1000 miles over the oil change.. so now I have to go take care of all that  He is just way too old to be so irresponsible/ inconsiderate.

6414 2018-11-17 17:49:17 Would annual compliance buyouts be on the table in 2020. Or franchise tags like in NFL. 2 annual buyouts without cap penalty would pay the player his contract and ensure teams are not stuck with bad contracts.

6418 2018-11-17 17:49:07 My boss love this peppermint essential oil ycc, that’s all she does ever put in the diffuser

6420 2018-11-17 17:49:01 OhOh (as in EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil)).  That kitten is incredibly handsome
6421 2018-11-17 17:49:00 for the sake of argument, a 2yr bridge deal would have left the money to retain Eberle.
6422 2018-11-17 17:49:00 Nuco Wraps are just 3 simple organic ingredients: coconut meat, coconut water, and unrefined virgin coconut oil. Speak with a rep between 11 & 3pm at Thornhill!
6423 2018-11-17 17:48:51 Don't kid yourself, Matthews will push McDavid's number & if he didn't keep getting hurt he's get more. Should he? Nope but that's how this thing works.
6424 2018-11-17 17:48:29 many raved about Fayne/Pouliot...Even Sekera and to this point the return on Sekera deal hasn't been as good as return on Russell, even though many still dislike the latter one more.
6425 2018-11-17 17:48:21 There's a reason he's holed up in the embassy of an oil partner of Russia's.
6426 2018-11-17 17:48:15 Store bought minced gearbox is months old and has no flavor. I needed the jar.  I mince batches of garlic on mon, wed, and Friday, add a touch of seasoned olive oil... pretty much I use minced garlic every day. You'll just need to mince three fat cloves of fresh garlic 
6427 2018-11-17 17:48:13 Prob is the contract & he’s leaking oil defensively. More shots against almost every yr, 4-5 seasons running. That’s a trend I’d like to sidestep. Could always just expose him to Seattle though I’d rather try for a return
6428 2018-11-17 17:48:13 But don’t get a oil diffuser if you have pets. Lavender is fatal to most animals.
6429 2018-11-17 17:48:11 We simply need to agree to stop selling weapons to tyrant governments and stop buying the oil from tyrant governments. We don’t need to sanction the murder of innocents by weaponizing evil tyrants.

6431 2018-11-17 17:48:04 Down by the burnt-out settlement? There's a mission called Fisher Of Men in Chapter 2, which just became available in Horseshoe Overlook once I'd finished Pouring Forth Oil - II and you take young Jack Marston fishing. Going to lose hours to this, I can tell

6433 2018-11-17 17:47:59 Totslly disagree. He presents a mythologized account of the history of public education, and with the broadest if brushes maligns the whole profession. Snake oil.
6434 2018-11-17 17:47:32 I have seen some old oil and gas hands convincingly present this case. At some point the tide of capital will flow out and we will get to see what happens.
6435 2018-11-17 17:47:32 It is worth acknowledging the vast and long lasting damage that is happening across this country and the world. Species extinction - as in not ONE creature of that species now exists. Extractive industries of all types, oil, coal, metals, aggregate etc etc.
Harm is happening.

6441 2018-11-17 17:47:09 Please it would save us whining Scots from doing it. We’ve got way too much to getting on with like counting the revenue from our oil and our Amber nectar when we eventually become our own nation  if we’re that much of a drag on you lot why are you all so worried about us leaving
6442 2018-11-17 17:47:07 My moms here so Ofcourse as soon as she heard me cough she was giving me every essential oil in the book.
6443 2018-11-17 17:46:46 Every team has missteps alng the way, coat of doing business. The issue w/ some deals is the fact they were handed out in the 1st place, when it's clear as day to all that it's a bad idea.
6444 2018-11-17 17:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
6445 2018-11-17 17:46:33 I thought it was more like an Avon Skin So Soft bath oil than soap
6446 2018-11-17 17:46:26 @BillyBillTrade1 that isnt you in the profile picture? That isnt the Debenhams look I expected.

6449 2018-11-17 17:45:52 Pity that over three quarters of the whisky industry is not 100 Scottish owned. All the power generation too. And all the oil companies who matter. And Diageo sell ALL their whisky and gin to a Dutch subsidiary at cost price for tax reasons.

6476 2018-11-17 17:43:07 To increase farmers income diversification fm traditional crops to high price crops is must. If farmers r assured market prices, we can increase oil seeds as well more production of minor crops to increase exports. Rising imports of pulses are main cause in domestic low prod.
6477 2018-11-17 17:42:42 Selling naked calls is insane. Especially on a commodity like natural gas or oil. Picking up pennies in front of a steam roller.
6478 2018-11-17 17:42:35 Not an acceptable answer 
6479 2018-11-17 17:42:34 Definitely speak to your Doc as the oil can interact with meds but you never know it might be a good try for you as your body is not responding well to traditional antidepressants.
6480 2018-11-17 17:42:33 Said at the time of Leon's signing, and stand by it. Slight overpay in the here & now but the Oilers got term & UFA years. That doesn't happen at $6M per.
6481 2018-11-17 17:42:31 kaiden just put tea tree oil on his lips and honestly i don’t know how to react
6482 2018-11-17 17:42:24 Oh I agree, it's a shame here on the east coast we are still using Saudi oil when we have a better product so close to home, much more environmentally friendly, & it supports our own.
6483 2018-11-17 17:42:12 No gets paid based on that except 97...Because he didn't a real comparable other than Crosby exiting ELC. No clue why others bring it up like it is common practice. It isn't. Rest of players get signed using comparables, not % of cap. UFA almost always get overpaid.

6491 2018-11-17 17:41:28 I can't tell if you want them still on (in which case, awesome, and they do look amazing), or not (in which case I'd suggest baby oil or similar).
6492 2018-11-17 17:41:13 Where do you see the salaries going. Me. I think its going to go downward. 650000 to 800000. The Leafs are a prime example. To retain Mathews Marner and Nylander there are going to sacrifices.
6493 2018-11-17 17:41:10 i slept with my hair in oil, and now i’m supposed to wash it out and i’m fucking lazy but i can’t be looking like this either.

6500 2018-11-17 17:40:29 The real problem is the massive expansion in production capacity. This massively increases emissions, “created” the lack of pipeline capacity and contributes to the decline in oil prices. If Alberta was smart, they would have higher royalties and stop encouraging expansion.

6524 2018-11-17 17:38:29 I don't think Drai is overpaid at all. Since start of 2016/2017 season he has 17th most points in entire NHL. Only players younger than him with more points are McDavid and Pastrnak. Many in Edm undervalue him IMO.
6525 2018-11-17 17:38:19 Did you notice the soft tone from Trump tweet about asking Saudi not a o cut oil production ????
Our government will not tolerate any foreign country about its politics and strategy especially if it comes from a friend !
Underline friend with so many lines !
6526 2018-11-17 17:38:17 Do not disagree with his current numbers. Is he a 3? Because he gets paid as such. He gives us a lot. I get frustrated at paying a players based on % of capspace. I. Could care less about that arguement. It has lead to an escalation of middling players salaries.
6527 2018-11-17 17:38:15 Ballbreaker, just because it has "Cover You In Oil."
6528 2018-11-17 17:38:14 is the first one oil?? or digital,?? or acrylic lmao
6529 2018-11-17 17:38:13 I’m at the bmw dealership to buy an oil filter but I could easily spend like 30 more minuets looking at cars.  so much beauty in one place.
6530 2018-11-17 17:38:04 You’re a snake oil salesman. Your intentions are not in our favor. It’s in yours just to have power over American citizens. Leaving WE, THE PEOPLE defenseless. The 2nd amendment is in place for tyrannical insane government officials like yourself. #MAGA #KAG #QAnon 
6531 2018-11-17 17:38:00 It was in the mid-1970s that the British Pharmacopoeia, a publication of medical substance quality standards for the UK, released a licensed cannabis tincture which featured CBD in full-spectrum oil intended for therapeutic usage. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol
6532 2018-11-17 17:37:59 Iz sweeting me ni as una get clan.. Very soon now they will sign u as brand ambassador for beard oil.
6533 2018-11-17 17:37:58 I asked for nkwobi oh... I got goat meat fried in red oil.
6534 2018-11-17 17:37:50 You bet it does. For the longest time, the worst contract on most rosters were in that $4M-$6M range for 2nd tier guys and what it did to everyone below them. That threshold has come up but I do think we are entering a time where most 4th line guys won't be paid what they were.
6535 2018-11-17 17:37:46 I have been to this area and marveled at the beauty and wildlife there. Hell no it isn’t a good idea for these tankers, oil rigs or natural gas to be located there. Once the essence of oil shows up you can count on a spill period!
6536 2018-11-17 17:37:23 Is that a photo of her? It looks like a bad oil painting.
6537 2018-11-17 17:37:13 Look at 'trendy' marks and spencers alot of their products contain palm oil.Clever marketing and branding make many people  not look beyond their products.Luckily it can start with only a few like minded people to see beyond and make a huge impact,the iceland advert great example
6538 2018-11-17 17:36:58 2/ Some isolated forms of macros induce short term compensatory response(eg. MCT oil ramps EE). Hyperosmolarity in small intestines, nutrient transit times & certain flavor components can suppress hunger too.
6539 2018-11-17 17:36:58 bunch of murderers who cut thier own people s heads of in the streets what kind of animals are these saudia arabis i say drop a bomb on the kings palace kill them all in power take there oil look what they did to us in the world trade killings
6540 2018-11-17 17:36:53 Ok. Good points  . Lets change zwarte piet to roetpiet. Give NTR time to change it. Once they prove they are changing it, stop with putting oil on a fire.
6541 2018-11-17 17:36:52 Jason went into work on his day off to replace my headlights and change my oil! I love that man 
6542 2018-11-17 17:36:42 By cutting out Iran's oil sales, he's hedged his bets.MBS can yank Trump's chain any which way he likes.we still need 13% ? Of oil from the Saudi's.
6543 2018-11-17 17:36:41 Nah just castor oil. Amla Oil is straight application.
6544 2018-11-17 17:36:38 I will be asking if Carrick qualifies for cannabis oil on Monday, it may reduce the tiny fits which he mainly has... as for the name , a brexiteer called remain voters that and it’s rather good, I’m sure he meant it to be offensive though 
6545 2018-11-17 17:36:34 Any tips on keeping your septum piercing from smelling like Khloe Kardashians coochie besides salt water and tea tree oil? Especially around cold season.
6546 2018-11-17 17:36:33 ate a pzza with black bean paste instead of tomato sauce. turn out if you put enough garlic and oil on something everything just tastes like garlic and oil. which is to say it was good
6547 2018-11-17 17:36:31 Agree but always worth noting hyg is heavily exposed to oil cos which could be ripe for a bounce in the near term imo. Opec meeting tues will likely discuss cuts, even if you don’t believe they’ll ultimately do it, opec knows it won’t be hard to move oil up given sentiment
6548 2018-11-17 17:36:24  lmao so you supply Beard Oil 
6549 2018-11-17 17:36:11 1. TUCSON, Ariz-Two things to do Fri: go to Walmart for an oil change & see @SCOTS_Music at @191Toole. Both cheered me up. SCOTS had it all. Great N.C. RocknRoll, fried chicken dancers, tribute to god Link Wray, makeup checks, a Luchador, surf riffs, & the ashes of Vincent Price!
6550 2018-11-17 17:36:08 #MSD: Nigeria is a wealthy Country, most of its vaste wealth is trapped in the ground (oil/gas/solid minerals), grows on it (Agriculture), blows or flows through it (Wind & water) or shines on it (Solar), there is also the Human Resource which is its most valuable asset....
6551 2018-11-17 17:35:56 But it still comes down to oil and mining to create the plastic, batteries and then hydro to create the electricity. You and I have had this discussion before. LOL. How are you ?
6552 2018-11-17 17:35:54 Sure, but that’s not how it works in sports anymore. If you don’t pay him, someone else will. EDM wanted to keep Russell in June 2017; market value was going to net him $4M — was the cost to sign the player. Happens across the league.
6553 2018-11-17 17:35:34 I don't have any suggestions besides keep reaching out and stay strong. I know it's easier said than done. Have you tried any natural meds? I heard CBD oil can be effective in aiding depression.
6554 2018-11-17 17:35:31 Like oil in an engine?
6555 2018-11-17 17:35:31 “Africa’s Best Herbal Oil” got it at walmart for less than a dollar !
6556 2018-11-17 17:35:30 Bold claim. Tesla isn't even the EV encumbent. Remember that EVs are not new, GM had the first US EV line in the 90s and was able to take it to production and sunset it much to the ire of consumers just to placate cronies in the oil industry.
6557 2018-11-17 17:35:22 You don’t have to heat or anything though right bro ? Or is it just castor oil ?
6558 2018-11-17 17:35:21 Thanks... But I'm scared to take red oil because I had enough of it in the Bolè
6559 2018-11-17 17:35:17 いやそれが意外と街頭が明るいんですわ…！うーん？？って感じで終わりましたｗ
6560 2018-11-17 17:35:14 Ahhh yes it changed my life today! I did brown sugar, honey and tea tree oil. Followed it up with some aquifor. 
6561 2018-11-17 17:35:07 Used to remember when Nigeria claimed to be the giant of Africa now all we have is crude oil and wizkid & Stew
6562 2018-11-17 17:35:05 How is enquiring that harmful to you?
6563 2018-11-17 17:35:02 getting a oil change , finally 
6564 2018-11-17 17:34:56 Go on tell me how much more oil Norway has produced as a percentage so we can work out what percentage of a trillion Scotland should have
6565 2018-11-17 17:34:47 In the AB energy diversification report, AB gov't says 43%. Approach the calculation with 0 oil and gas activity. No royalties, no oil & gas employees with high salaries, no oil & gas subsidies for farms, no oil & gas manufacturing, no investment.
6566 2018-11-17 17:34:44 my favorite = the weirdos who are like "add a few drops of this $20 lemon oil to your water for a refreshing boost!"

actual lemons are like 30 cents and lemon juice is a dollar, with the bonus that uh, I WON'T DIE
6567 2018-11-17 17:34:44 My original undiluted designer oil perfumes will give you the same effect, with as little as 4500 you can get our 30ml bottle. People underrate the power of a good perfume
6568 2018-11-17 17:34:37 When you thought your friends would be the perfect protein shake but they’re water and oil 
6569 2018-11-17 17:34:32 Kaya toner2 lainnya, enak. Cocok buat oil skin kayak aku
6570 2018-11-17 17:34:27  waaa... Ile kiboko inakungoja hell inaingzwa crude oil pale turkana
6571 2018-11-17 17:34:26 marcus it looks like your slathered it in oil. I’m calling the cops
6572 2018-11-17 17:34:22 @WBrettWilson Why after so many years of trying to get our Oil to world markets would the Oil companies or the govt build our own refineries? Existing pipelines could then carry fuel versus crude? Thx
6573 2018-11-17 17:34:22 random guy at oil changing place: “drive fast and take chances, bye”

6575 2018-11-17 17:34:20 I literally just got done everything I needed to do at Walmart. Oil change, tire repair,  Christmas decor, buying address labels, PRINTING invites and address labels at fed ex. And I even spied on them bringing in all the black Friday goods.
6576 2018-11-17 17:34:06 But Us policy in Syria is to weaken Asad regime. Not to make it fall. Also, as always: OIL. That is where you can find your troops now, east of Syria. 
So US policy doesn't care about making millions of people easier to breathe...
6577 2018-11-17 17:33:54 exactly. and other really bad stuff. we have nothing in common with them, other than oil. and we don’t need theirs now.
6578 2018-11-17 17:33:42 FINALLY: going fishing in RED DEAD REDEMPTION II. You know, as a respite from stealing oil tankers and running up huge bounties because I forgot to put my bandana on yet again
6579 2018-11-17 17:33:30 All American govt leaders hv been kissing their asses since 1970s bc they r puppets of donors/shareholders/corporations like Exxon [Mobil] which continued to exist bc of its oil partnerships & facilities in SA. #Disgusting #Immoral #AmericanActivities #USAgovtIsThoroughlyCorrupt

6582 2018-11-17 17:32:58 I person i very much respected, a physicist who works at SpaceX posted on infographic on the book about oils. I thought "nice, she's smart still".

Nope "OIL FLOATS ON WATER, THAT MEANS IT DOESN'T MIX. IT WON'T DILUTE IN WATER SO YOU'RE STILL DRINKING IT CONCENTRATED"

Oil and wash on partially charred spots on paper
6584 2018-11-17 17:32:53 In Abuja Forte Oil is the best in terms of service and reliability.
6585 2018-11-17 17:32:47 Russell leads D in points and is 2nd in GF% at 55% behind Klefbom who is 56%...which you just said is very important.
6586 2018-11-17 17:32:44 You don't even need to spend a lot,oil perfumes come in various bottle sizes,as lil as 30ml,different designer fragrance to choose from.smelling good makes you feel good
6587 2018-11-17 17:32:39 so i made an appointment for my oil change at 10:30... it’s been an hour... so why make an appointment?

This too Shall Pass 

The Future Sez
Oil is DEAD as an Energy Source
6589 2018-11-17 17:32:12 Aw you're a special kind of stupid and ignorant huh. You're either too dumb to realize you were sold snake oil from a person who has lived up to nothing he promised or too embarrassed to admit it or too poor to do anything about it
6590 2018-11-17 17:32:09 We need a millennial Teddy Roosevelt. We broke up standard oil, the banks, the railroads. Time to fracture the tech cos, Koch, Walmart etc.

6592 2018-11-17 17:31:51 They wienot hear, my original undiluted designer oil perfumes do not contains l alcohol so they can be mixed with body lotions,just a lil dab,and you will smell fresh all day.Nothing is more attractive than a man who smells fresh
6593 2018-11-17 17:31:39 Hi,  Palm oil fractions are also used as ingredients in food products such as dough fats, cooking fats, shortenings or margarine due to their stability and high melting temperature Palm oil is used for its various physical properties and composition of fatty acids(1/4)
6594 2018-11-17 17:31:38 @Oreo please stop buying dirty palm oil to make you biscuits. You contribute to suffering and misery of the life on this planet in doing this. 
#DropDirtyPalmOil
6595 2018-11-17 17:31:36 Activists are still users .the big oil giants have killed off some alternative energies.look up tesla and free electricity.wars in the middle east create so much concern but not for people but because these countries are lithium rich.the new oil....
6596 2018-11-17 17:31:18 WHY ARE WE STILL BUYING SAUDI OIL BROUGHT IN BY TANKERS SHIPS AT HIGER COST TO OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ECONOMY AND JOBS? Where are all the environmentalists on that? @cathmckenna @JustinTrudeau @ElizabethMay Crickets.  Politicians (Paul Matin’s shipping company) #Cdnpoli
6597 2018-11-17 17:31:14 which impart desirable sensory characteristics (in chocolates & confectioneries) and stability to food (like noodles etc) prepared with palm oil. Palm oil has approximately 50% saturated fatty acids, 40% MUFA’s and approximately 10% PUFA’s. (2/4)
6598 2018-11-17 17:31:04 God speaks for himself.  But he uses earthly, imperfect vessels at times, even used a donkey once!  I don't claim to know it all or be God's person of power for the hour.  His word can be a hammer to break the hard places of our heart and also be the healing oil of LOVE to mend.
6599 2018-11-17 17:30:59 It only does that if the GM agrees to it. And the owner.
6600 2018-11-17 17:30:58 It has many food applications, where it can be safely used. Palm oil is always consumed as a part of the end dish/food and generally managed by the right portion size.(3/4)
6601 2018-11-17 17:30:52 So buying a loaf of bread @ $1.60 from $0.90, buying cooking oil @ $8.00 from $3.20 is the future we deserve?? Please give us a break.
6602 2018-11-17 17:30:45 Runaway train, oil and water and the new more than silence...and the rest! 
6603 2018-11-17 17:30:42 peppermint oil is great because muscle relaxants but also I GET TO SMELL LIKE CHRISTMAS

6605 2018-11-17 17:30:33 Intelligent people: we’re running out of oil we must focus on renewable energy

america: YEA WE’RE NUMBER 1 IN OIL PRODUCTION WOOOOO
6606 2018-11-17 17:30:32 Snake oil
6607 2018-11-17 17:30:24 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ
6608 2018-11-17 17:30:24 Interesting about graphs it shows how dependent USA is on Low API oil (Heavy) –
Main source is Canada – Mex and Ven also heavy oil-great that you are getting word out on how cdn being taken to cleaners
6609 2018-11-17 17:30:08 most overlooked critical element is letting the roast get to room temp before cooking.  let the roast bathe in olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and your preferred herbs for a good 2 1/2 hrs out of fridge. high heat (475). consult your fave site for time, based on weight of roast.
6610 2018-11-17 17:30:07 We have bought out Belanger Pouliot. Ference and now Sekera on litr. Mark Fayne. The list of cap space waste is endless.
6611 2018-11-17 17:29:57 The more you fund guys at the top, the more next group below them rises. Take McDavid/Draisaitl contracts. McDavid got $12.5M, Draisaitl & his camp argued he shouldn’t be drastically underpaid in comparison to be No2 best O player on team = $8.5M. Continues to trickle down
6612 2018-11-17 17:29:51 Also this is why u get mct oil and down a tablespoon if u get hungry
6613 2018-11-17 17:29:48 Kim wondering if Lonsdales are made using palm oil? And ultimately giving not one shit.
6614 2018-11-17 17:29:44 1 cup of coffee
1 tbs or MCT oil
1 tbs of grass fed butter or ghee (I use kerrygold unsalted since ghee has a funky taste) 
I/2 tsp of stevia
1/3 cup of coconut/almond milk (I use a blend, regular milk doesn’t like me) 
*I add my plain collagen protein powder 
Blend away, enjoy.
6615 2018-11-17 17:29:38 I’m a makeup artist and EVERY time someones breaking out everywhere they ALWAYS tell me they use coconut oil in their skincare routines... smh. Its ok in really tiny amounts but normally people use too much
6616 2018-11-17 17:29:32 Alberta has lots of oil....just need a pipeline
6617 2018-11-17 17:29:19 Biologists put bamboo in the grass category (hollow stem).  So bamboo is woody but not quite wood. 

Prof. Saville at @ChemEng_UofT was once looking at poplar trees as a source of biomass because they grow quite fast. That was before oil prices tanked.

MOAR wood(y) facts.
6618 2018-11-17 17:29:11 I looove oil slick hair! It’s impossible to maintain but damn how gorgeous 
6619 2018-11-17 17:29:06 We don't need filthy oil. We need Solar & wind to save the earth we're killing.
6620 2018-11-17 17:29:05 Oil MONEY
6621 2018-11-17 17:28:53 Is that your way of giving yourself and Trump a pass for soliciting and accepting  obscene amounts of money and support from extremist Christian evangelicals and the likes of charlatan snake oil salesmen who’ve caused pain and suffering to so many you’ll never know or care about
6622 2018-11-17 17:28:31 Imagine the cap space we would have if we didnt blow money on Kris Russel. Ryan Strome. Zack Kassian. Your 4/5 dmen. 2million. Tops. 6th 650 to 1m. 7- 13 th forwards. 2million to league mimimum.
6623 2018-11-17 17:28:30 Damn this bipolar ass weather forced me to get a oil change
6624 2018-11-17 17:28:21 that was another vice i gave up a few years ago. it was making the anxiety worse. i do take cbd oil now and that helps! i wish smoking it was legal here so i could get the right strain every time for sure.

6627 2018-11-17 17:28:15 Question/ Info - Have we started spraying our border walls with Pam or olive oil or coconut oil or lithium gel lubricant to keep those illegal immigrants off those walls. Spray them now, it's a simple fix!  And move some of that moth ball fleet down to the boarder as housing.???
6628 2018-11-17 17:28:14 12:30pm and I've already been told I need to add some garbage doterra essential oil to my coffee

6631 2018-11-17 17:27:55 Wm will NEVER give a people vote if so they would have to allow Scotland a second vote and they know we would leave this time and would never take the chance of losing scotlands now with new oil fields and gas !!

6635 2018-11-17 17:27:27 We apologize for a discrepancy in items by Tom Santosusso, some items were marked oil pastel when the medium is acrylic paints.  To clarify only “Cape May Sunset” and “Plains and Mountains” are oil pastel paintings.
6636 2018-11-17 17:27:25 I guess @iyaboawokoya  4got sometin that budget are prepared based on projected income in which case we have prices of oil above d benchmark

6639 2018-11-17 17:27:04 One of the arguments I have heard is that you will spend money on food/etc when you go to charge... even if you do, that's better than giving it the oil companies hahaha and you get food!!! Go @Tesla !!!!!
6640 2018-11-17 17:26:57 Remember years ago when Canada was on the verge of becoming a global energy superpower? Now the US is that superpower and Canada still sucks in oil from SA, Venezuela just to feed itself.
6641 2018-11-17 17:26:45 Wrong Wrong - Why are you a defender of Tar Sands Dirty Oil ? Much better we look for solutions that work for all Albertan's & Canada - Lets take hate & prejudiced out of the discussion &  lets look for solutions that are best for all humanity ?

6649 2018-11-17 17:26:05 Think about how many wars, the men women & children have been blown to pieces just for oil in the past 100 years! Yet, when oil prices go up THE MAJORITY OF US don’t see the balance of our bank accounts go up. Do u DIRECTLY benefit everyday from oil prices going up? Somebody does

6653 2018-11-17 17:25:39 Remember the UN officials accepting bribes from Saddam and facilitating work around the oil embargo?

This is only one pale example of what can take place in organizations with no accountability.

6655 2018-11-17 17:25:32 It is way past time to end this evil alliance with the Saudis. 90% of terrorist activities can be traced to them yet they keep smiling to our face. But first we have to eliminate our dependence on their oil. #Solar #Wind #Renewables #Biofuels #Agrifuels

6658 2018-11-17 17:25:17 The fans pay to see 97/93/29. The fans pay big money to ensure their stars remain with their teams. Middling tweeners should be paid as such. Agents can ask what they want. Its the idiot GMs who pay these stupid salaries to bottom 6 forwards. Im for paying my stars.

6660 2018-11-17 17:25:14  Not the prick prick stage. It has to be a bit longer. A beard  needs to be wet after the nanikane. It’s also good for the beard alternative for beard oil(my theory)
6661 2018-11-17 17:25:05 "Maam, when we change the oil in your car do you want us to rotate the tires?"
ME: Won't they do that when I drive away?

6665 2018-11-17 17:24:39 If Democrats want to win, they must focus on building a party that supports ALL working people, not just big donors ie., big pharma, financials, defense industry & big oil. Otherwise, voters are going 3rd Party
6666 2018-11-17 17:24:28 I failed to mention that a barrel of oil is worth $13.  We are now supposed to sigh a collective sigh of sympathy for the Alberta oil patch, who although sit on billions, decry governments for the state of the economy. We are bit players and we are doomed if we stay this course.
6667 2018-11-17 17:24:18 I think Clarida was sent out there to set the table as they are always gradual.  When Dec rolls around they’ll likely make that .25 hike then change the statement to data dependent.  Some of that inflation triptrap will get helped by oil dropping like a rock

6669 2018-11-17 17:24:09 The Saudis being massively short puts on oil showcases the the catastrophic synergy likely when IYIs ("Intellectuals yet Idiots!") collaborate - in this instance MbS and Goldman Sachs.

6672 2018-11-17 17:23:51 So is banning abortion and telling women what to do with their bodies less govt? Or if gays can have a job or marry? Or giving free money to farms or oil? What about subsidizing milk is that small gov? Or 15k troops at the border & they can do nothing to any immigrants...
6673 2018-11-17 17:23:36 Trump & his family will do anything to keep Saudi money flowing into their bank accounts. Come on folks, even when we knew it was Saudi nationals who attacked us on 9/11, we didn’t blame them or sanction them. Why? Oil & arms deals...all abt money.
6674 2018-11-17 17:23:33 Yes I am seeing the pictures. Beautiful place and they have all that oil. They about to blow up
6675 2018-11-17 17:23:30 Fact I just learned: CBD is not the same as “hemp oil”.
Hemp oil is the equivalent of coconut oil or olive oil. 
Make sure you know exactly what you’re buying when you go to purchase CBD or CBG products!
6676 2018-11-17 17:23:29 My father told me that the Germans knew how to do it. during WW2, that's why we had to bomb their ball bearing plants to stop them. He said when the war was over, this technology was covered up, to protect the oil industry.

When is the last time you heard a good nickname like Oil Can?
6726 2018-11-16 23:55:38 Don’t be silly. The queen contributes more to the economy than oil
6727 2018-11-16 23:55:35 It’s beyond disgusting. Scott is a spineless weasel snake oil businessman and an embarrassment (another one) in my states laughable attempts at voting the right way . UGH 
6728 2018-11-16 23:55:34 *Oil prices are down 30%+ globally in the last 6weeks.
6729 2018-11-16 23:55:23 Cover evenly. Don't forget the handle and bottom. Not too much oil or it'll be sticky! It's better to do multiple rounds than too much oil at once. And cook! The flavor of whatever you're cooking will also season it . Oil after every wash.

6731 2018-11-16 23:54:44 I suspect this is part of a plan to open federally controlled areas for mining or oil production. Removing wildlife from endangered species will clear a hurdle to this process for the trump to line his pockets through insider trading.
6732 2018-11-16 23:54:29 diga não ao palm oil
6733 2018-11-16 23:54:28 Oh and you can and should set aside the tiny smaller m chunks that inevitably happen when one chops up cauliflower and tosses it in spices and oil, and add those  mid to 3/4 bake so they don't burn half way through but still get cooked.
6734 2018-11-16 23:54:25 Consciousness & Cooning is like trying to mix oil and water.
6735 2018-11-16 23:54:21 I want all the bread. The gluten & the yeast kind. Spare no butter.

And I'm gonna dip it in perservative-laden ranch, ok cashier at Whole Foods?
6736 2018-11-16 23:54:21 remember the simpler times when our secretary of state was just an oil baron who would've done that same thing
6737 2018-11-16 23:54:21 That is what he blames big oil for!!
6738 2018-11-16 23:54:16 of course not, the shithole to the south is damn near self sufficient in oil and gas.

6742 2018-11-16 23:53:58 Oil is a sealant, if your hair is dry and you use oil you seal in that dryness. Use water for moisture or any water based leave in conditioner and then add oil to seal the moisture in.

6744 2018-11-16 23:53:56 It absorbs the oil OBVIOUSLY
6745 2018-11-16 23:53:54 right. when you drive you burn gas AND oil and you put wear on your car. idc if they tank is full, it’s common curtesy. Especially if you have gas money to give.
6746 2018-11-16 23:53:53 The oil industry always tells us the tankers never have spills.

6752 2018-11-16 23:53:33 2. God blessed Nigeria with oil boom under him & he was selling crude btw $125-140 per barrel yet he didn't build any infrastructure. Constitutionally, d excess over d benchmark price of crude with which our budgets are calculated are automatically for saving in an E.C.Account.
6753 2018-11-16 23:53:26 The trope is that approximately 16 million people control all the money in the world. The fact is that none of those 16 million control oil which literally controls all the money in the world.

6758 2018-11-16 23:52:16 Yeah. Force Quebec to get oil from somewhere else. . .
6759 2018-11-16 23:52:05 I don't know if it was Russia, but Putin is a climate change denier. Hey, I guess they can't admit climate change is man made. Got to keep those oil rubles rolling in.
6760 2018-11-16 23:52:04 I love Tulsa but not sure about this declaration.  I guess "Oil Capital of the World" wasn't bringing in the talent like it used to.
6761 2018-11-16 23:52:03 Relatedly in doable recipes: cauliflower, chopped into bite size ish chunks (discard very woodiest bits of the stem and leaves), toss in oil and paprika and salt (maybe also chili powder if that is your jam), spread out on a baking tray and bake at 375 for 30 ish mins

6765 2018-11-16 23:51:22 Yup. Boycott their oil. Truck it from Alberta instead because our country can’t unify around an east-west pipeline.
6766 2018-11-16 23:50:57 Wouldn’t have to do that if the leftists weren’t so scary! They have threatened her life. They are threatening the lives of many republicans in leadership. HRC said the civility would return when they oil the house. You’ve won. Be civil for goodness sake.

6770 2018-11-16 23:50:00 I dont think MbS is being set up. Kashoggi was a prominent voice for extremist and MbS killed him. The evidence now gives Trump leverage over MbS to keep oil prices down.
6771 2018-11-16 23:49:47 And after the inevitable oil spill, how much tourist revenue is lost?  And how much irreversible damage to the ecosystem? We need to move towards more renewable energy!

He said sure, but that I would have to put the tires in/out of the car. 

I put them in. But when he got back, he took them out of the car. The amount of appreciation is  level

6785 2018-11-16 23:47:28 I mean... is it too obvious to say Russia again?  New northern ports open up, oil, gas, and minerals unlocked by melting permafrost... they stand to gain quite a it by accelerating climate change.

6789 2018-11-16 23:46:13 It will be interesting to how MSM TV coverage handles oil spill versus raw sewage spills
6790 2018-11-16 23:46:04 W3 rather make w3 own money in small increments through my stature as a librarian and feel myself being a pixie than beg someone to take my ink and oil off my trees for public use. Dark Magic. Its not a gamr if they setting u up to set me up. U forget the sky is mean.
6791 2018-11-16 23:45:54 You think he's cool? Check out Daniel Plainview. If you didn't know, he's an oil man.
6792 2018-11-16 23:45:51 The plan is name change from Oil Sands to “Le Oil” and watch Trudope come to the rescue
6793 2018-11-16 23:45:41 @jkenney Kenny you just single handed got our whole family to become Green Party voters. Thanks for your continuous oil mongering pipe dream big business pushing wash up.
6794 2018-11-16 23:45:38 @chigrl Hi Chigrl, can u update your SPX chart please? Your last chart with Oil and SPX to 2700 followed it very well. Thanks in advance
6795 2018-11-16 23:45:33 Oil looks to have put a bottom in here 

I’d say oil long from here is a fair punt although many may wait for OPEC to show their hand first
6796 2018-11-16 23:45:27 Have you ever considered CBD Oil? A lot of our followers benefit from taking CBD for anxiety.
6797 2018-11-16 23:45:23 We should ban oil tankers on the East Coast especially the ones that are pollute the waters
6798 2018-11-16 23:45:00 One way would be immediately stop buying their oil!
6799 2018-11-16 23:44:59 Just got blessed with a free oil change
6800 2018-11-16 23:44:28 Congratulations to the Oil and Gas Industry.
6801 2018-11-16 23:44:24 Was planning on sleeping in tomorrow but of course my change oil light came on #adulting #imtiredofit
6802 2018-11-16 23:44:04 We are giving our oil away.
6803 2018-11-16 23:43:45 We should stop selling our oil!!! instead put it all into strategic Reserves meaning in this time of upheaval why is the government not buying it all, why aren't we building more refineries everywhere,
6804 2018-11-16 23:43:24 We're deploying our last greatest weapon. A flood of the oil supply
6805 2018-11-16 23:43:24 Ah, I see. I suppose oil independence (or rather, independence from oil) would probably solve a lot of these issues.
6806 2018-11-16 23:43:24 @TheLastLeg #isitok just watching on plus 1 and you’re more concerned about Iceland being concerned about not being able to promote not using palm oil over John Lewis promoting Elton’s tour
6807 2018-11-16 23:43:21 It is foolish to have faith in the @DNC here in CO our new governor @PolisForCO made it clear during his campaign he was on the same side as the oil and gas industry he has now also made it clear he likes Betsy Devous education system time for a #RealWave
6808 2018-11-16 23:43:18 I do full routine at night and use vitamin e oil, but I normally don't use it in the morning during summer because I ended up too oily...

BUT I never thought about it helping in the winter

6810 2018-11-16 23:42:58 It's 2018, not the time stamp they refer to. Oil prices still down? Hum.
6811 2018-11-16 23:42:44 We buy your dirty oil and you rub the money on our faces! What are you doing to Muslims with the weapons you bought from us? Killing children in school buses! I could go on and on and you know it! Hypocrisy is the compliment vice pays to virtue!
6812 2018-11-16 23:42:29 Or engine oil
6813 2018-11-16 23:42:12 And Russia has a ton of oil.

6815 2018-11-16 23:42:02 Gotcha. Duly noted. The unit I'm using has a sturdy basket with separate handle attachment...I'm doing it outside also. Very concerned about the oil...as you said Medieval warfare hot. #WhatCouldGoWrong

6818 2018-11-16 23:41:45 The US military entrenchment in the oil rich regions of eastern Syria are in absolute violation of international law. In sharp contrast, the military presence of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah are by the legal invitation of the legitimate government of Syria.
6819 2018-11-16 23:41:44 Well maybe if she hadn't been elected in to power you might have had a government that would stand up more for its people and push @JustinTrudeau to do what's right and get oil moving
6820 2018-11-16 23:41:37 They mentioned the oil rebound a couple times, despite the fact that all of this year’s gains have been given back. 2019 Alaskan growth was certainly dampened these last few weeks.

6822 2018-11-16 23:41:28 The way I see it.. 
1. either they sink the price of oil to kill shale or 
2. We go back to 66 ...just enough to piss Trump off but not enough to hurt EM market demand, specifically India  (biggest growth sector)
6823 2018-11-16 23:41:27 Yes it’s a dilemma.  did it a generation ago to be indpdt from oil.

Nigeria is a federal state, hold your governor accountable please
6830 2018-11-16 23:40:55 I am spent 4 hours on appointments, oil change, car wash   Glad to get it done. Thank you for you IG story from mast njght!   Enjoyed it a lot. Love her
6831 2018-11-16 23:40:54 Is that what your little brain can make out of the statement. What is the point retaining government agency that is running on deficit all the while. Bringing in investors to revive it and pay tax to govt isn't it better. Nig is the only country where govt controls their oil comp

6837 2018-11-16 23:40:14 We do the rocket launcher. Timing is key - 3mins per lb + 5 mins with oil at 350. I brine our turkey the day before. Your choice but I think it helps to retain moisture and add flavor since you won't be basting it. If you inject flavor can skip the brine.
6838 2018-11-16 23:40:13 With stuff like that i think you have to see who would benefit the most from this? I think it was big oil or maybe big scantron @desusnice @THEKIDMERO

6840 2018-11-16 23:39:58 Sometimes life’s timing is perfect. Very conveniently, Bongo's rise to power happened just as the scale of Gabon’s oil deposits was being discovered. Look at God!
6841 2018-11-16 23:39:58 What's for dinner? Gluten-free rosemary, olive oil, and sea salt cracker crusted baked chicken tenders and steamed asparagus, that's what!
6842 2018-11-16 23:39:54 i make myself this amazing home made body scrub with an oil in it, I never need to moisturise after and skin feels great. I use it in the shower.

6846 2018-11-16 23:39:33 And maybe write up some law saying no foreign oil in Canada, if quebec wants foreign oil then they don't get any equalization
6847 2018-11-16 23:39:32 It makes a difference to us, the US, which is what is important.
We must demand appropriate responses in regard to weapons, oil & criminal justice.

6851 2018-11-16 23:39:12 Start baking. Good luck, though, finding a spread without palm oil in it. The only one I can find is butter.
6852 2018-11-16 23:39:07 I don't usually care but I had coconut, almond and castor oil in my hair. LMAO. So I smelled hella funky.

6855 2018-11-16 23:38:39 Oh dear, the price of oil is tanking. Oh what shall we do? How about leave it in the ground and these corporate morons who bet the farm on never ending huge profits financed with other peoples money can go bankrupt? Or will the politicians bail them out with your money?

6858 2018-11-16 23:38:26 Renewable energy is mostly constructed using oil based products plus pipelines are the safest means of transit. Read up on the amount of energy that EV's take to produce. Solar is killing hectares of farm and pasture land, and windmills are killing millions of animals.
6859 2018-11-16 23:38:17 Laid more oil pipes than Bush, opened up more fracking, obscenely expanded the surveillance state and took us from 2 wars to 7...... 

That's what the last neoliberal centrist supermajority led by Pelosi got us. 

No thanks.

6863 2018-11-16 23:38:01 Just imagine if the damn @liberal_party hadn't spent $4.5 billion to buy a pipeline they cant even get built but insted spent that 4.5 billion towards getting a pipe to the west and east coast. And get the oil flowing to market

6869 2018-11-16 23:37:11 It's pretty simple really. The lead is about pipelines. Canada needs to get our oil to tidewater so we can have autonomy over our own resources. No one in Canada should accept that the only way to sell Canada's resources is through the US.

6873 2018-11-16 23:36:43 The gov. of corrupt lenin moreno is worsening the situation after it decided to open a oil explotation platform right in the heart of Yasuni.
6874 2018-11-16 23:36:36 It also hurts those who could use that oil ...
6875 2018-11-16 23:36:36 What we are giving oil away? That is good that's what Canada is about, we are on track! Canada is on the road, to recovery a nation that gives everything away and still comes out on top for the economy.

6883 2018-11-16 23:35:42 Oh oh, I guess the oil will be joining Black Friday, to keep friends as friends.
6884 2018-11-16 23:35:37 I love multi coloured hair and am currently growing out this style of rainbow oil slick colours lol I prefer non normal hair as shows your willingness to be different and to stand out even when your not confident in yourself

6887 2018-11-16 23:34:22 An oil industry group released a report saying that offshore drilling will bring South Carolina an extra 62 billion dollars in clean up expenses alone. (Current tally for 2010 gulf spill) There. I fixed it for you.

6897 2018-11-16 23:32:22 It’s taking 3 dudes to change my oil on my car. Should of done it home and it would of been faster 
6898 2018-11-16 23:32:20 A combination of stuff.. I use coconut oil most of the time but castor oil works too for the growth
6899 2018-11-16 23:32:13 You can buy fish oil caps for the Omega3.  Cod doesn't have much flavor so maybe your tastebuds just aren't prepared for it...  I hate bland food and love cooking spicy and otherwise flavorful food.  Salmon has a LOT of flavor.
6900 2018-11-16 23:31:59 Yeah last time I got an oil change I got charged over 300$. Gotta love being a female.
6901 2018-11-16 23:31:58 Something oil based probably to remove it
6902 2018-11-16 23:31:54 Looking at the dire economic situation the greens,ndp,the fn.the reformers,and ecologists have placed the notley and trudeau govts by imposing unreasonble demands on construction of the safest oil transport possible,maybe they prefer rail transport to hudsons bay
6903 2018-11-16 23:31:46 Nope they won't. I'm only saying what is probably gonna happen. Unless the FAI somehow strike oil in the jax, we'll never progress internationally. It'll be like post Jackie Charlton era times 10. Ah we're fucked

6914 2018-11-16 23:30:54 Due to all the turmoil in this State (Ohio), I had to break down and buy an essential oil diffuser.  Water, 4 drops of Lavender and 4 drops Frankincense - we are so calm and relaxed that we may not accomplish anything when the thing is working... It smells good too!
6915 2018-11-16 23:30:49 Zinke definitely should resign because he has put oil drilling interests ahead of the need to protect our national reserves.  He also committed ethics violations by having his wife officially become a volunteer so she could fly free on commercial flights.  He needs to go.

6926 2018-11-16 23:30:00 And if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have washed it till tomorrow until it got greasy. LOL 

Joking aside, my hair is too dry so I'm letting the oil build up.  

I'm mortified.
6927 2018-11-16 23:29:59 1/2 Peter Lougheed used to tell Albertans to think and act like owners of our oil resources.

Fried yam alone or with ketchup 
Yam in egg with pepper soup 
Boiled yam and palm oil 
Yam ball
Yam pottage 
Pounded yam with vegetable soup 
Yam is really underrated 
6932 2018-11-16 23:29:25 never had a proper oil burn, it really hurts
6933 2018-11-16 23:29:22 Although I am relatively happy with epidiolex a lot of parents are not. They are giving their child better whole oil which is helping. Why should they have to change to a different, less effective, product.
6934 2018-11-16 23:29:12 But there isn’t much money in extracting either. I don’t have any strong insight into oil manufacturing. My background is consumer/durable goods/food manufacturing. 
The $ always in further processing & offering a distinguishable, unique finished good/service/component /acumen
6935 2018-11-16 23:28:58 In the 70s nuclear started to replace coal and oil in electricty generation and did so very quickly where it was allowed to flourish. We already wasted 40 years waiting for the renewables wonder. Can we wait another forty years for the storage fairy?
6936 2018-11-16 23:28:56 I’m such a hoe for balsamic vinegar and olive oil.... with some fresh baked bread 
6937 2018-11-16 23:28:53 Shitttt i just oil my scalp and keep argan oil and shea butter leave ins
6938 2018-11-16 23:28:52 At what cost to our environment? Americans overwhelmingly want to invest in renewables, not big oil, for a better climate and environment.
6939 2018-11-16 23:28:47 Tell me more about that free standing island, Mr. Villa. Mineral oil, you say?
6940 2018-11-16 23:28:45 Yes, there was a quick scale back of 2019 price expectations. I just am struggling with (and there is no answer) quantifying the impact of the oil $ doing precisely what the broader mkt feared it would do - a quick collapse. Can't help but think this will reinforce the wariness.
6941 2018-11-16 23:28:39 Why should a styling oil contain CBD? I mean, I'm for sure not the right one to discuss hair problems, but as long as nobody licks at the hair there will be no effect 
6942 2018-11-16 23:28:37 Trump administration caters to oil, gas, & chemical companies.They pay hardly anything for cleanup. They also dont care about our health, the water, food, national monuments. America has spoken.foodhttps://www.ecowatch.com/pipeline-explosions-financial-penalties-2620058644.html
6943 2018-11-16 23:28:09 my mum has slapped so much oil on my head i fear the american government are onto me
6944 2018-11-16 23:28:07 ありがとー！おねえちゃんありがとー！おねえちゃんも今日は都会だって聞いた！お互い楽しみましょー！！！
6945 2018-11-16 23:28:04 They're really nice people though.
We get oil from them, you know?
6946 2018-11-16 23:27:51 Further comment on our economy - we have record household debt, interest rates are climbing, imports are increasing, losing money on oil, federal spending is over the top, Canada/provinces have record levels of debt with no plan on balancing the books. Even pot is losing $$
6947 2018-11-16 23:27:45 Buy more Oil from the Saudis and sell more weapons to the Saudis...it will solve the Problems..just keep n going like this

6953 2018-11-16 23:26:55 Happy Birthday Joey !!
6954 2018-11-16 23:26:54 asdfaffada Thanks!! It's gel lipstick called #Woodblock from Shiseido, if you just put on one layer it will become lighter few seconds after you put it on! The texture is super smooth and light like cream without oil, highly recommend!!

6959 2018-11-16 23:26:26 Build that Wall and have a mechanism where oil or some slippery substance comes out when it detects someone trying too climb it. 
6960 2018-11-16 23:26:12 If the oil sands were in Quebec the pipeline would be built and equalization payments would be a thing of the past
6961 2018-11-16 23:26:04 Once again y’all, I’m lactose intolerant. I’m also at @SixFlags where they serve dippin dots. Tryna decide weather or not this is a good place to start leakin oil. Questions? Concerns?
6962 2018-11-16 23:25:54 Boy I swear a lot of y’all mfers showed yo tru colors last night...Bruhz need to have oil more often @Lasio_12 @_Tjones4 @MiacahC_
6963 2018-11-16 23:25:52 
6964 2018-11-16 23:25:42 @Gamblin_Colors is it true you do not donate to artistic altruistic causes?  I just just emailed your website was told "As a small manufacturer, we do not have a sponsorship program"  Are you not the one of biggest oil paint manufacturers in the US?  Or is there another avenue?
6965 2018-11-16 23:25:41 Dropped and broke a bottle of shower gel, and now my entire room smells like tea tree oil 
6966 2018-11-16 23:25:33 I hate the smell of baby powder in oil form 
6967 2018-11-16 23:25:33 We need to find a way to coexist with animals without destroying them
The current example being orangutans and palm oil, we need to find a way to collect palm oil without destroying these animals habitats and leading them to extinction
6968 2018-11-16 23:25:29 Teach them that they skin black like oil, that’s a royalty 
6969 2018-11-16 23:25:28 Buy oil in Monopoly money please
6970 2018-11-16 23:25:26 WHEN YOU RUN TO GET AN OIL CHANGE WITH SWEATS AND GLASSES AND STILL GET ASKED “OH SO YOU CAN’T HAVE FRIENDS”.  GOOD TO KNOW I STILL GOT IT. LOL 
6971 2018-11-16 23:25:25 1/?

Easily, and without even having to fight if we don't want to.

The majority of pro-2A Americans do blue collar jobs. Growing/transporting the food, pumping the oil, maintaining the power grid, etc. so if a war breaks out, most of that comes to an ass-grinding halt.
6972 2018-11-16 23:25:12 Oiler fans! Forget the trade. Let's come together and watch the Condors tonight.  We can unite watching real player development happening like it hasn't happened for the Oil since the year most of you nerds were born.

Also, Woodcroft seems to have a real PP and now I feel shame.
6973 2018-11-16 23:24:57 Dogs in the profile make me a bot - no I’m a human that cares about my dog. Now back to oil, everyone may use it but that doesn’t make it healthy for the planet. You are clearly not an independent thinker. You’re a poor minded maga’t that cares for only yourself
6974 2018-11-16 23:24:30 Use vegetable oil or canola oil, place it in the oven upside down (place foil beneath it) for about an hour on 400°.
6975 2018-11-16 23:24:19 Pepsi uses palm oil, so no, it isn't ok. Stick to coke.
6976 2018-11-16 23:24:14 らいむぎさんお誕生日おめでとうございます
6977 2018-11-16 23:23:58 The head of the Environmental Protection Agency was an oil lobbyist before he was in charge of the Environment. Let that sink in
6978 2018-11-16 23:23:53 More cheap oil coming .....
6979 2018-11-16 23:23:52 @JustinTrudeau ,its time to do whats right for Canada,call an early jan election on building the pipline to the coast,initiate the energy east to quit buying saudi oil,and let all canadians enjoy an improved economic environment they deserve.
6980 2018-11-16 23:23:48 I suppose your right, because now you can’t work abroad in Europe. To do the job, you could once do, in your own county because it closed down. The EU have relocate it in an east European country and funded it all the way. Getting closer to the Arab states where the oil is.
6981 2018-11-16 23:23:43 Has he called it a "hoax" yet? that's coming. what's the desperation with oil and arms? was there an illegal deal made between the trump family and the Saudis? trump is a little too desperate about oil and arms
6982 2018-11-16 23:23:17 @chevrolet Why do you repair the known excessive oil consumption issue on 10'-12' Equinox, but not 13' with exact same motor? numerous threads online with people having same issue. I would love to know you guys care about your customers.
6983 2018-11-16 23:22:57 Pa change oil na ang mio yiee

6989 2018-11-16 23:21:42 I currently have avocado and olive oil in my hair to help it get shiny and grow. It is so nasty and I can’t believe I’m doing it 
6990 2018-11-16 23:21:40 I’m guessing from what you’ve said, you’re in one of those invidious situations where the weight of the law tips in favour of you, but you don’t have the oil to grease the gears?
6991 2018-11-16 23:21:36 Time to burn the mid night oil.
6992 2018-11-16 23:21:36 Perhaps listen to the CEO on banning palm oil at Iceland and why he has taken this stand and why they have spent the money on make this advert.
6993 2018-11-16 23:21:35 Def NOT Eberle for Spooner. Isles fleeeced the Oil, like devs did w Hall. This is just throwing ur arms up and saying “wtf”, it can’t b worse, take a shot on the kid
6994 2018-11-16 23:21:31 zach bagans is such a snake oil salesman
6995 2018-11-16 23:21:15 Salman: I didn't do it!
Trump: Works for me! Give me more money from the oil wells!
6996 2018-11-16 23:21:11 Lexington - Classic snake oil salesman.
6997 2018-11-16 23:21:07 as stated earlier, one Trudeau almost destroyed the Canadian oil/gas industry and now we have another trying just as hard. Wake up Canada
6998 2018-11-16 23:20:52 OPEC need to just drop oil to 25/bbl and we can watch Putin get put in his place
6999 2018-11-16 23:20:52 mfs will be yellin for a doctor and some dude gon jump in like

“give him some cbd oil i heard about it on joe rogans podcast”
7000 2018-11-16 23:20:49 My favorite soup base technique is definitely roasting things off in an iron skillet with some seasonings and oil, optional smoked meat, and adding that to some stock that's simmering off with some additions in it

Simple flavors on the stock side so that it all balances out
7001 2018-11-16 23:20:49 Until they run out of oil, nothing will be done about it
7002 2018-11-16 23:20:45 Who has the answer to this question? 

Why can’t food makers use a different oil (olive, sunflower, safflower etc) to put in their junk food? 

What makes palm oil the ideal choice? Once they destroy all the habitat then what?

7007 2018-11-16 23:20:04 Most of Norway’s energy is produced by hydro, not wind or solar. Norway’s is one of the world’s largest oil exporters.
7008 2018-11-16 23:19:58 Screaming hot skillet. Rub pork chops with garlic. Little olive oil, s&p, bring skillet down a bit. 4/5 min a side. Remove from heat and hit with squeeze of lemon

Bye spiders!
7013 2018-11-16 23:18:27 I need a new oil plug.
7014 2018-11-16 23:18:26 Use tea tree oil , or mix some aspirine with water, has to be like a paste and put it on your cheloid (that’s how it’s called)
Pierced mine 9 months ago but I still had those until I used those remedies.
7015 2018-11-16 23:18:16 So I went to get my car checked out today (it's been in need of repairs for a while) radiator is leaking, needs an oil change, 3 tires, shocks are shot, and a few other things. Bad news? 1000 to fix everything. Good news? They're letting me do an interest free pmt plan for a year
7016 2018-11-16 23:18:01 @GeoMusson tl;dr: Not banned for its content but the ad was made by Greenpeace (a political group) and you can't show political ads in the UK. And the palm oil issue is very complex but overall, still good awareness for the tree lads.
7017 2018-11-16 23:18:01 It’s like 40 bucks, just gotta warm it up. And you ain’t gotta mess w all the fryer and leftover oil, I’m never cooking another bird again.
7018 2018-11-16 23:17:51 @APIenergy can you tell me what the c & the j stand for in co 4 engine oil? I understand the "c" is for commercial,  but what does the "j" stand for? It has to mean something!?
7019 2018-11-16 23:17:51 Cue the science deniers. They will type on a handheld computer and let satellites tell them where and when to drive and science will stop their cars and heat their homes but they draw the line at all those rich scientists attacking the big bad oil companies. Fuckin idiots
7020 2018-11-16 23:17:37 went from  cute key lime pie to the soggy kale salad drenched in oil my white mom brings to the neighborhood block party
7021 2018-11-16 23:17:36 the neoliberals should never have pulled the oil subsidies out
7022 2018-11-16 23:17:24 me: h

people with oily skin: coconut oil made my skin breakout.
7023 2018-11-16 23:17:22 But the oil always gets in my mouth idk how to make it stop ive tried hitting it lighter, or changing the coil. I can’t do them /:
7024 2018-11-16 23:17:16 Rub baby oil on my chest. But as friends tho.
7025 2018-11-16 23:17:10 So I guess jimmy john’s chips are fried in peanut oil so now I have hives and my lips are huuuuge
7026 2018-11-16 23:17:02 “A surge of major foreign investments into Northern Territory resources could see the region transformed into a "massive oil and gas base" within 10 years, according to Northern Australia Minister Matt Canavan.”

Probably financed by Aus Gov EFIC loan like Onslow & Exxon PNG LNG.
7027 2018-11-16 23:16:54 #pnpcbc. This is an embarrassingly ignorant discussion on Canadian oil sands production. A fundamental lack of understanding of transportation differentials and supply and demand displayed. 

@jengerson mostly gets it but please get someone who understands our industry
7028 2018-11-16 23:16:50 They're also trying to create opportunities that will retain young people and support entrepreneurship, there's a brain drain and the population is decreasing. Despite having a good university, unless you want to work in oil & gas the town has felt like a career dead end.
7029 2018-11-16 23:16:48 Every single one of you who've taken oil money should be ashamed of yourselves. You cannot lead on climate change.
7030 2018-11-16 23:16:47 Put tea tree oil. It dries those little bumps right up! Also it might help to change to gold jewelry. That’s always helped speed up my healing processes with piercings
7031 2018-11-16 23:16:43 I put flax seeds or chia seeds in my eggs in the morning!  Also, a spoonful of coconut oil in my coffee!
7032 2018-11-16 23:16:41 The EPA is led by people who want to allow our ground, water, oceans and sacred memorials desecrated by oil companies and frackers. I’d hire an independent investigator.
7033 2018-11-16 23:16:37 Thank you!   Haha. Us Oilers fans feel like we’re taking crazy pills.  No other organization displays these levels of ineptitude and still holds their jobs. But up here in Oil country, job security for life!
7034 2018-11-16 23:16:29 There’s a witch in Minsk called Maya. She enjoys oil painting and petting her fire-bellied toad.

7036 2018-11-16 23:16:26 I've worked for an oil & gas company & undertook multiple courses on the industry & science. That is what informs my views on this issue. There's a dozen alternatives to fossil fuel. & if we want the earth & humans to survive, it's the only damn option. D'you understand sea-rise?
7037 2018-11-16 23:16:05 Coconut oil dries my hair out too! I use olive oil or pure Shea butter
7038 2018-11-16 23:16:04 I’ve used this tea tree oil on my face for only three nights and my face is like 95% clear and I’m so happy
7039 2018-11-16 23:16:02 Yes sir, all good forsure. Love the number 4 as well. Every morning.....been doing it for a long time.  Now some days I do use coconut oil if I skiped bacon a day or two. 2 or 3 jalapenos delish
7040 2018-11-16 23:15:54 take a soda can and let it sit over a fire for 3 mins. Look how hot it'll  get. Look how much soot will collect on the can.. now imagine what humans are doing to the earth burning coal/fossil fuels/oil reserves 24/7 FOR DECADES. u dont give your child a toy so they can destroy it
7041 2018-11-16 23:15:52 Them cheese fries & scallops was just oil
7042 2018-11-16 23:15:51 as long as you have olive oil and garlic you’ll figure something out
7043 2018-11-16 23:15:13 I want to have my room like the ones on Pinterest with the indoor lights dangling from the curtains (now I gotta get some curtains for my room) I want a tapestry, I want a record player in the corner, I want an essential oil diffuser and new incense to burn...
7044 2018-11-16 23:15:06 There was no fight, there was no quarrel. There was a planned ambush authorised by the very very top. The foot soldiers will be executed and we will buy their oil
7045 2018-11-16 23:14:56 i’m getting an oil change right now and i’m literally fucking shaking. why am i so scared and what am i even scared of
7046 2018-11-16 23:14:50 Can’t find oil cartridges anywhere
7047 2018-11-16 23:14:47 You're missing what is causing the problem. It's not the supply from any single place, it's the demand worldwide which makes it profitable for unscrupulous people in Borneo and Sumatra to clear cut. 

Boycotting palm oil lessens demand and reduces incentive to illegally harvest.
7048 2018-11-16 23:14:42 Hey guys,  been out this week,  what did I miss in oil/nat gas #oott 
7049 2018-11-16 23:14:28 Oh my god so cool! What did you do in the circus? I once drunkenly learned to fire throw because the performer was hot so wanted to impress her.... The oil splashed back in my eye and ended up in A&E Which was the closest I came to circus performing (also pre Lazer bearded lady)
7050 2018-11-16 23:14:27 Wondering why I'm sleepy cse stupid ass btch gave me all that oil last night
7051 2018-11-16 23:14:08 Low oil prices and still we are smoothly shafted at the Pumps. Bend over !!
7052 2018-11-16 23:13:58 well i had to get out of my depression and self hate first  but i use bioré, witch-hazel with rose water and vitamin e oil
7053 2018-11-16 23:13:47 i would suggest adding sexual assault avoidance classes to elementary curriculum including self defense in several martial arts. and once 16, she must demonstrate the ability to change her own tire, jump start car battery,  and check her own oil as a prerequisite to driving.
7054 2018-11-16 23:13:44 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

7064 2018-11-16 23:12:21 I have an unfinished pueo (owl) painting & it was my very first time using oil. I started it 4 months ago & I finished the face but I messed up the body, had a meltdown bc of it & I kind’ve just put it on the side & worked on something else.
7065 2018-11-16 23:12:08 What are you doing to forward our oil resource development and export that we desperately need to see happen?

7068 2018-11-16 23:11:47 Pro Tip. If you put a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil in your shower, your shitty bathroom immediately turns into the Four Seasons.

7070 2018-11-16 23:11:34 Reasons being he plans to use proceeds to diversy the economy, he believes it will help boost investors confidence in the oil sector increasing export capacity to 4millions barrels per day as we are currently exporting under 2million barrels per day
7071 2018-11-16 23:11:27 I think it's a good idea to start really simple, I have a lot of things in that soup but the flavors didn't come out clashing because I tried to stay moderate

A simple stock (chicken), a flavor or food item you want to taste/eat in it, a little salt/pepper and oil/fat
7072 2018-11-16 23:11:05 1 day left to protect the #rainforest, #orangutans, and #palmoil workers from greedy companies like @Indofood! RT to tell @RSPOtweets, the global palm oil body, to vote to stop certifying destructive palm oil in its new Principles and Criteria #RSPO #RT16
7073 2018-11-16 23:11:01 Jiffy lube stay tryna finesse  I just came for an oil change
7074 2018-11-16 23:10:56 If we refined our oil. Fine.... But we don’t ... Raw resource extraction so we’re exporting most of the jobs...

7077 2018-11-16 23:10:42 America's youth, you are one, are the A D U L T S among us. They are head & shoulders above most in Congress. We may see a nation w/leaders who aren't bought off by the NRA, Big Pharma, the Oil Industry, Russia (GOP won't even secure Mueller's investigation), Arab murderers.
7078 2018-11-16 23:10:41 Print more money-get to 25 cent Canadian Dollar-this way the Asians and Yanks will buy our minerals, grain and heavy tar oil for pennies on the dollar-that’ll stimulate the economy-give all free Med care, open the borders, make all citizens after 1 year and they’ll vote for you!

7080 2018-11-16 23:10:19 has ability to transport oil dropped?
If it is the same  as before and was already at capacity, then oil producers who increased production are the ones who caused the problem.
7081 2018-11-16 23:10:19 The palm oil adverts got me stressed, ran out of shampoo and conditioner now I got the bars from lush.... less plastic and less palm oil #itsastart
7082 2018-11-16 23:10:16 Before and after linseed oil. Love this part!

7087 2018-11-16 23:09:47 Bible says: “The Son (Jesus) says, “Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of Your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God set You above Your companions anointing You with the oil of joy.” (Heb 1:8-9)
7088 2018-11-16 23:09:44 I will fear no evil:  Thou preparest a table before me 

thou anointest my head with oil; 

Psalms 23:5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

7090 2018-11-16 23:09:36 2/2 Transporting refined products is very safe by truck or rail. Kinder Morgan transports crude oil, refined and semi-refined products together in the same line. This process, known as “batching,” means that products can follow one another through the pipeline. #cdnpoli
7091 2018-11-16 23:09:26 lubing up with olive oil right fucking now
7092 2018-11-16 23:09:12 . @TheLastLeg In the break after this weeks show (16/11) @IcelandFoods advertised their mince pies and added the line ‘and no palm oil’ to the end!  #notbanned #NoPalmOilChristmas #NoPalmOil #PalmOilFree

7094 2018-11-16 23:09:03 About Saudi Arabia's govt oil company? Its called  ARAMCO, this company can monitor every single oil drop that comes from der earth, what do we have with @NNPCgroup ? We have Ships/Vessels loaded with millions of barrels of crude oil that cannot be traced. This happens daily OK?
7095 2018-11-16 23:08:42 Because 2.5% is too much for any country to handle

lmao
7105 2018-11-16 23:07:45 And can journalists please stop equating 'energy' industry with 'oil' industry? They are different - oil, of course, being a subset of energy...

BTW, I lived thru the 80's in Alberta - the last time foreign oil companies packed up. It wasn't so bad. Alberta will survive.

7109 2018-11-16 23:07:34 God is so good! I just got a free oil change because I waited so long. Met a stranger who seemed they just needed an ear to listen & ended up adoring me and said some kind things about me as I left.
7110 2018-11-16 23:07:32 i got this. I can figure it out.

7113 2018-11-16 23:07:18 Cement production contributes 5 percent of global pollution? The liberals pushed a huge bombardier Cement plant through environmental revues in Quebec while destroying oil?
7114 2018-11-16 23:07:15 I hate waiting at dealerships. I only needed an oil change my guy .
7115 2018-11-16 23:07:14 I am in California where we pay practically double what other states pay for gas..and it is still going up, so if there is so much oil to sell why in the world we see increases at the pump?
7116 2018-11-16 23:07:06 Super idea considering the dire oil situation in tne west and house price deceleration starting to create duck and cover scenarios
7117 2018-11-16 23:06:57 Troye: if vegetable oil is made from vegetables, and coconut oil is made from coconuts, is baby oil-

Jacob: please stop talking
7118 2018-11-16 23:06:50 Alberta's oil industry has been hooped for a decade. Congratulations on catching up with reality. And it has nothing to do with Trudeau.
7119 2018-11-16 23:06:45 A good first step would be stop buying Saudi oil, many would agree we could help ourselves and hinder the Saudi regime #pnpcbc
7120 2018-11-16 23:06:44 Someone should mention what goes on on the Wet Coast where a city of 350,000+ like Victoria dumps ALL their raw sewage directly into Orca habitat. But... stop those pipelines and their transportation of the evil oil!! Crickets.
7121 2018-11-16 23:06:37 it had nothing to do with OPEC dropping the oil price leading to the coup then because the poor were destitute?
7122 2018-11-16 23:06:14 How so?Did Harper set the price of oil? How did Trudeau stop Alberta from Generating Revenues?
7123 2018-11-16 23:06:10 I think you can add any oil that’s good for your hair
7124 2018-11-16 23:06:07 Thanks Vampiro. Hearing that from you actually makes me more inclined. I smoke plenty of bud, but don't take CBD oil. Admittably, I could use more exercise in addition to a healthier diet. Thank you again, from a a life long fan.
7125 2018-11-16 23:05:50 @jengerson Two for two, yes, we need access to tidewater for our oil. This is one of the many reasons aboriginal title in Northern BC hus to be addressed.
7126 2018-11-16 23:05:49 Yes, reduction in MACE w/ Vascepa was greater than expected for TG-lowering alone. Likely also had antithrombotic & antiarrhythmic effects. LDL rise in mineral oil placebo unlikely to fully explain difference. I think this should now be tested for 2° prev pts without elevated TGs
7127 2018-11-16 23:05:44 Bertolli is a great oil brand
7128 2018-11-16 23:05:43 That is partially correct insofar as the major oil company concerned have enough influence to coerce govt, legal and media bosses... I have researched it in some depth.. My family is in bits that I can't get the justice from my own govt and legal system
7129 2018-11-16 23:05:35 nothing says foreign-funded quite like foreign-owned oil and gas companies trying to run the script on what responsible environmental stewardship & resource development means in our country #KeepItInTheGround #stopkm #boycottalbertaoil #boycotttarsands #bcpoli #skpoli #cdnpoli

7132 2018-11-16 23:05:01 Venezuela was on it’s way to become a third world country before Trump’s sanctions were even conceived. The administration only imposed it this year but Venezuela was in a death spiral since the price of oil tanked in 2016. Chavez was lucky to have enjoyed some initial windfall.
7133 2018-11-16 23:04:57 why in the fuck did i CHOOSE to schedule my oil change for 8 am on a saturday.... i hate myself
7134 2018-11-16 23:04:47 Mikes good with oil, come through bro
7135 2018-11-16 23:04:30 I came to get my oil changed and my mom was supposed to pick me up after I dropped my car off but now she wants to make me wait for it at the mechanic
7136 2018-11-16 23:04:11 Nigeria’s greatest export outside of Nigeria in recent years is not oil, it’s Nigerian music
7137 2018-11-16 23:04:10 Your body is fucked because you are a machine sometimes you need to add oil into the cracks
7138 2018-11-16 23:04:07 This is what I'm brining south...we'll be there Monday night:
4 boxes rice fry oil
2 cases cheese sauce (12 cans)
4 gallons honey bourbon...
7139 2018-11-16 23:03:53 Bro life is GOOD. I got a full tank of gas, changed my oil out, rolling with the windows down jamming to Oxnard, cleaned the house, ate some good food, and ON TOP OF IT ALL I got a lil cutie to share all my happiness and love with. Life is good.
7140 2018-11-16 23:03:52 おめでとうございます！？
7141 2018-11-16 23:03:40 All I’m going to say is, the oil company’s are making a killing off of this liquid gold they call diesel
7142 2018-11-16 23:03:21 @DrGundry I love your diet but how are most of us going to be able to afford $35 for an 8.5 oz bottle of your new olive oil? I know it's 30x the polyphenols but it's also 4 times the price. You have to be wealthy in order to be healthy with your supplements.
7143 2018-11-16 23:03:20 Caroline, we have a new refinery in Alberta - NW/Sturgeon. It's still at Phase 1 and there is question as to the economics of it, but it is operating. It is "fuelled" in part by commitments of the AB government to supply it with royalties-in-kind, or oil taken in lieu of cash.
7144 2018-11-16 23:03:10 Well, it's Friday night. Time to construct an interstate oil pipeline
7145 2018-11-16 23:03:06 @PnPCBC could canada use churchill as a port to ship oil to European countries. Gives us another option if BC wont let pipelines thru
7146 2018-11-16 23:02:53 You're right. Captialism never killed anyone which is why the United States has never bombed any countries for oil. 

Seriously though, we're done here. You've got QAnon conspiracy theories to catch up on and I've got a job I should be doing.
7147 2018-11-16 23:02:51 How much will the clean up in lost wages, tourist dollars, Marine life and the food we eat cost every time the oceans, beaches & rivers are polluted?  Oil wells spill & ooze.  Money makers don't even try to say things will be different with "their" wells any more.
7148 2018-11-16 23:02:47 These guys that can Not Shut Up about

Palm oil is one of the leading exports of the Philippines, and its PR from US big business - of course, the environment when in fact 

PALM OIL IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
you can harvest it almost MONTHLY 12 months a year

7151 2018-11-16 23:02:02 全ての社会保険料が上がっていく中で、雇用保険だけ下がる現実を見た方がいい。何故雇用保険が下がるかと言えば、企業が不必要な人材も仕方なく抱え込んでいて潜在的失業者が雇用されているから。
これ以上企業に重荷を背負わせるのは、どうかと思う。

7157 2018-11-16 23:01:21 If the Federal Govenment had placed a ban on the export of crude oil and got an agreement from primary producers to sell crude to Canadian refineries at a reduced rate—like the US did—we would have had very viable refineries. 1/2 #cdnpoli
7158 2018-11-16 23:01:16 Magnesium and CBD oil for you if falling asleep is your concern, if the study was about apnea, never mind.. 400mgs. Magnesium in the evening helps deep sleep, its amazing..

7167 2018-11-16 23:00:14 Yeah I keep hearing the argument that texas cant pull out of energy cause it will crash out economy or cause us to rely on foreign oil. They dont even consider renewables as an option.
7168 2018-11-16 23:00:06 Today I went to J. Welch Farms right outside Victoria and purchased a few items from their first olive harvest during a tasting and tour event. Olive oil, balsamic vinegar, shampoo, conditioner, soap, and spices.
7169 2018-11-16 23:00:01 @MbSofKSA Wow you must be pissed at Erdogan huh? Pathetic little bitch. Murderer. Dictator. Murder Bonesaw Man 

I can't wait for the US to stop selling you weapons and buying oil from you so we can finally turn your evil country to glass.

7170 2018-11-16 22:59:51 @juliusbaer on #Oil: „no big jumps anymore“ (expected).                             

IMO: Current uncertainties can easily fuel volatility and the alleged hedge fund loss (short squeeze on #Natgas) shows how painful a tail risk sting can be.
7171 2018-11-16 22:59:49 Like I said yesterday the show was an escape for me watching people go all in    I admired you guys I was waiting for Jack to strike oil in the glory hole lol lol
7172 2018-11-16 22:59:43 I’m not worried. 

The wide open spaces and low cost of living will turn the voter Red not the state Blue
7173 2018-11-16 22:59:38 Yea amazing what oil can do for state. Same goes for tourism.  Who run the government in those states have zero to do with the state income tax.  It’s because of the dead dinosaurs and those flocking to see a mouse.
7174 2018-11-16 22:59:35 Of course an oil industry group would say that
7175 2018-11-16 22:59:33 What happened here? Did the cash pipeline from the protest organizer shut down?  All of a sudden they realize that without the protest money coming in, they need more from the taxpayer, so now we need to sell more oil to keep them happy.
7176 2018-11-16 22:59:16 You've posted that before.

7177 2018-11-16 22:59:13 I hate when people assume all girls can’t take care of their car I make sure I change my oil every 3000 miles I check the tire pressure I changed my own alternator about a month ago not all girls just let their car go to shit js.

7181 2018-11-16 22:59:01 Donkey I feel your pain. They’re trying to kill the oil and gas industry plus the coal industry I have in my state.
7182 2018-11-16 22:58:58 Probably not gonna be able to make it down. I should get the oil changed in my car and hopefully I can do that tomorrow. I also want to go look at dj controllers at a store.
7183 2018-11-16 22:58:44 Et a Prague tout va bien ,vous n'avez pas de problème de gas oil ?
7184 2018-11-16 22:58:36 Yet another tip: want Kraft dinner but wanna be light with the dairy? Put aside a bit of the pasta water before draining, add a tiny bit of olive oil to it instead of milk and butter. 
7185 2018-11-16 22:58:29 You know you’re an adult when all you want for your birthday is your oil changed 
7186 2018-11-16 22:58:02 @PnPCBC Confession...I don't give a rat's ass about AB's oil anymore. I just don't. It's actually not even the oil industry that I loathe it's the politics....it seems that if it's not the team of your choosing solving issues there's a lot of profit in prolonging the problems
7187 2018-11-16 22:57:59 Oil prices might fall sharply in 2019; #OPEC predicting slump in demand of crude next year. How close are we to finding an alt-oil revenue?
7188 2018-11-16 22:57:58 I know the basics but I've definitely been had more than a few times. It's so frustrating. I hate getting my car worked on. I hate even having my oil changed because they akways try 2 get more money out of me some other way & I don't even trust these assholes to change that right
7189 2018-11-16 22:57:55 Beauty is pain unno cuz it's paining me to have this coconut oil in my hair.

7197 2018-11-16 22:56:26 In the middle east,we can use the plumbing& discarded oil wells to pump seawater inland,  heat it by geothermic heat inside coils in the deep earth of the oil well and evaporate the sea water,sea salt by-product and we naturally seed rain clouds
geez,  is this a book or a tweet?
7198 2018-11-16 22:56:19 I got my oil changed! I have a winter coat, hat, gloves and $40 
7199 2018-11-16 22:56:13 Highly unlikely that CBD actually helps in most applications.  It's the snake oil of our times.  The value for people is most likely in the THC (like wine), not the CBD (like medication).
7200 2018-11-16 22:56:01 This lavender oil I have burning right now is bomb in a good way.
7201 2018-11-16 22:55:59 just didn't make sense TO ME to spend $70 on 4ozof Vitamin E,Tumeric,TeaTree,and Jojoba Seed Oil when $70 could buy the same ingredients to make 50oz of it;But manage your money how u see fit. if any time you wanna take me up on buying it for me;let me know!

And Twitter free.
7202 2018-11-16 22:55:57 Along with tea tree and manuka oil!
7203 2018-11-16 22:55:55 CBD oil under your tongue
7204 2018-11-16 22:55:51 @DrGundry why isn't your new olive oil organic? Thank you
7205 2018-11-16 22:55:42 We’re talking government mismanagement of nationalized industries, price controls leading to shortages, unaffordable subsidies, printing money to finance deficits leading to runaway inflation, diverting oil revenue from reinvestment in production and of course corruption.
7206 2018-11-16 22:55:32 @Bill_Morneau 
The price of oil isn’t just an Alberta problem. It’s a CANADA PROBLEM.
7207 2018-11-16 22:55:25 Does CUFI sell potions and snake oil too? Well, I know about the snake oil.
7208 2018-11-16 22:55:23 Urgent vote to transform the #palmoil industry! RT to tell palm oil body @RSPOtweets to become credible & adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ policies in its new rules - and enforce them against @Indofood too!  #RT16 #RSPO
7209 2018-11-16 22:55:20 This has nothing to do with your party...it's all about oil production.
7210 2018-11-16 22:54:55 I have no idea how much cbd oil I took, but I hope it was correct
7211 2018-11-16 22:54:15 Palm oil is used in many cases where it wasn't needed before especially agrofood industry and vegetal fuel. And surface efficacy isnt a receivable argument to maintain this nature-destroying production. It's grown at the most precious nature places : tropical wetlands
7212 2018-11-16 22:54:14 来来季以降を見据えてか？阿部引退後をみてなのか？それは若手を放出してまで必要なことなのか？
7213 2018-11-16 22:54:04 Now Jen Gerson is an expert in the Alberta oil industry, which isn't even on the same page as to what is a crisis and what isn't. #cdnpoli #abpoli @PnPCBC
7214 2018-11-16 22:53:47 Clinton took where daddy bush left off then baby bush blew up the towers got us into war to get oil and use up our military surplus then osoma oboma passed so many decrees almost taking our constitution out and to replace it with the nwo. But our Father in heaven saved us. Trump

7216 2018-11-16 22:53:43 I can live off of veggie pasta with olive oil and garlic salt on it like yes I will never get tired of this delicious goodness 
7217 2018-11-16 22:53:40 I had one cookie a friend made work on me. it was coconut oil based and he had used 2 oz of funk in one batch. I've tried gummies, drinks, suckers, candy bars, brownies tons of brownies.  I envy people who can enjoi an edible
7218 2018-11-16 22:53:37 Palm oil is in too many products.  Check your soaps and almond butter peeps!
7219 2018-11-16 22:53:36 I hate how at some spots, the fried chicken be tasting like mad oil. CHANGE YALL DAMN OIL OUT!
7220 2018-11-16 22:53:34 #pnpcbc  well Alberta has a decision to make.  Keep oil fairly priced and Ontario residents can buy it and afford to buy their beef too.  If there is no solution to the price glut time Notley moved on or lose embarrassingly like others for her avarice.

7222 2018-11-16 22:53:12 
7223 2018-11-16 22:53:02 That's a fairly significant amount of oil.
7224 2018-11-16 22:52:43 Ho esagerato con il tea tree oil xD 
Adesso profumo di vicks
7225 2018-11-16 22:52:37 All ongsc biz have been handed over to Mukesh all oil imports earlier were being done by STC now its with Mukesh,all defence equipment’s were manufactured by ordinance factories are now given to Modi’s pals & many are dying 2014-19most sea ports are with Adani ,ILFS given away
7226 2018-11-16 22:52:28 As long as oil doesn't continue its precipitous drop, we're are likely to recover, for GC it's the "turn" as we usually see this type of behaviour towards year-end as funding costs weigh in on investors. 1/2
7227 2018-11-16 22:52:18 I agree but does this mean we can end the PetroDollar and the implicit guarantee Nixon made to SA of protection in perpetuity in return for oil traded in dollars? So Russia will be their new pimp? No way that’s happening. SA is full of crap.
7228 2018-11-16 22:51:47 Norway not random, Numbnuts.
It's similar population to Scotland, found oil at the same time in the same sea, and unlike Scotland used it to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world.
Because unlike Scotland, Norway controlled her own destiny.
7229 2018-11-16 22:51:42 Champagne, two champagne glasses body oil  scented candles, preferably sandalwood and a masseuse to relax with. Afterward a hot romantic interlude and a dip in the ocean.
7230 2018-11-16 22:51:41 What emergency? CBC just said it’s only a little backlog of oil. Companies just need to stop production for a while. And @Bill_Morneau said the economy is doing great. So stop fear mongering you ambulance chaser! 
7231 2018-11-16 22:51:26 Rapeseed oil is a major one for me. Toxic fatty acids
7232 2018-11-16 22:51:26 Try peppermint oil
7233 2018-11-16 22:51:24 レクレにローソンできるんか
7234 2018-11-16 22:51:24 Soybeans and oil for truce?
7235 2018-11-16 22:51:23 The big problem is that we will never get a greedy and opulent political class to hand over what they control. It would be interesting to research how the policies in AK have varied over the years with their oil $ disbursements.
7236 2018-11-16 22:51:20 The amount of luck varies from person to person, and many people get there with it being a really small part of the equation. I don't see anything wrong with this kind of coaching on paper, so long as the person offering the advice isn't selling snake oil.

7238 2018-11-16 22:51:13 I used to work in pizzerias and Italian restaurants when I was a teenager and in my early 20's. A lot of them used anchovies as an ingredient to make their tomato sauce. It's usually sauteed with the garlic and olive oil before the tomatoes are added.
7239 2018-11-16 22:51:05 과다복용 님!
7240 2018-11-16 22:50:52 Joe, has anyone calculated the total damages of a large oil spill off our coast?
7241 2018-11-16 22:50:43 We could go on. Suffice it to say, the oil and gas sector is important to the Canadian economy, with extraction alone (excluding support activities), accounting for 7% of GDP. Only the most foolish government wouldn’t support, and forfeit revenues that support programs/services.
7242 2018-11-16 22:50:27 Every time I smell something and not nothing, I’m like “is that propane, should I call my dad” my heat is oil. Idk
7243 2018-11-16 22:50:21 Ranieri is from rome. I suggest spaghetti cacio e pepe: very simple spaghetti dish with sheep cheese and black pepper (and a bit of olive oil).
7244 2018-11-16 22:50:11 Don’t get me wrong I love the grains they just don’t love me back so much. 
Fact is I used to bake the best sourdough. Heaven. Little balsamic vinegar olive oil. Oh my
7245 2018-11-16 22:49:55 And the average citizen wouldn't see a dime of it.
I thought I made this clear when I voted for @JoeCunninghamSC but KEEP YOUR DIRTY HANDS OFF OUR STATE TREASURES BIG OIL!!
7246 2018-11-16 22:49:53 Bio oil helps defo helps! Over time they will fade though. I have loads on my hips, legs etc and you can hardly see them now. Xx
7247 2018-11-16 22:49:35 My coworker carries his dab pen with him everyday in his pocket, this mf let it off lmao had the whole room smelling like oil 
7248 2018-11-16 22:49:34 You can do that stuff every other oil change and you’ll be fine unless your tire tread is low
7249 2018-11-16 22:49:26 Im getting a kick becauae i gotta go to walmart later for cereal, chonies, nerds, motor oil and .22 shells.
7250 2018-11-16 22:49:18 With the money I’ve spent on wine lately I probably could’ve gotten that oil change I need done at least twice
7251 2018-11-16 22:49:17 I bought a set from Amazon stainless steel and did it myself watch YouTube vids and use vitamin e oil
7252 2018-11-16 22:49:06 Hate getting oil change they always wanna say something is wrong with my car when that shit is still new STOP TRYING TO TAKE MY MONEY!!

7259 2018-11-16 22:48:25 Me: drizzling white truffle oil over my wild mushroom pizza (yes, I know what Bourdain said.  I'm poor).

Him: I don't really smell anything.

7261 2018-11-16 22:48:19 The guys at the oil change place think I’m the stupidest human that’s ever walked this planet. I didn’t even know how to open my front hood 
7262 2018-11-16 22:48:12 Clocked out fr work 
No where to go   Yet!

5:00 appt for vehicle oil change.
7263 2018-11-16 22:48:02 Shout out to the parts department at my local VW dealer for giving me wholesale pricing and free oil screw plug but no shout out to the sales dude trying to get me to upgrade to a new Passat GT.
7264 2018-11-16 22:47:54 remember that time before pnc where the guy has to fix my engine cause the check oil light kept coming on when i had just gotten oil? SO SHUT UP ABOUT YOUR FLYING CAR
7265 2018-11-16 22:47:51 When will u guys start doing this
7266 2018-11-16 22:47:51 Getting my oil changed and tires rotated. I can tell they’re on my car because “DAAAAAMN, she even got the Transformers tire valves!”

7271 2018-11-16 22:47:10 Why is it weird? It's like investing money in both green energy and oil (which Shell and BP both do).

7273 2018-11-16 22:46:59 Winter is here ... don’t forget to oil your beard 
7274 2018-11-16 22:46:55 Well we are the world's largest oil producer, let's start using our own supply and start charging Mexico less because we taxed them big time.
7275 2018-11-16 22:46:29 Mark, you need to do your homework, sport.   Everything in this article was written by people who know NOTHING about the industry.   If you hate oil so much, how can you use it daily, for everything.  Oil is the free worlds life blood, until something better shows up.
7276 2018-11-16 22:46:26 Not true! He is just selling illusion while stealing from the government budget, oil company, Saudi business men, Saudi Princes, and even from the people by cutting their salaries and such. Not to mention his killing record. He should be in prison not ruling a country...
7277 2018-11-16 22:46:16 Also tea tree oil. And vinegar. She didn’t trust lice kits so I was an experiment lol.
7278 2018-11-16 22:45:56 Trying to convince my dad to take Cbd oil was a fail hahahaha it turned into a lifetime lecture :/ 
It just comes from a plant man!!!
7279 2018-11-16 22:45:54 Do you really have this lack of understanding? Nothing you did has affected gas prices. Oil market prices are down. That is why prices have dropped. Just another #FordFraud
7280 2018-11-16 22:45:41 i have least exposure to oil and finance.. and i might want to add more finance.
7281 2018-11-16 22:45:26 Sign me up! I look forward to blowing up oil pipelines to save the environment, and conducting regime change in Georgia once again! :D
7282 2018-11-16 22:45:21 How long d'you think the US can be "world #1 oil producer" b4 1/2 US becomes uninhabitable?You're thinking waaay to short term.

7290 2018-11-16 22:43:55 The EPA did it for the BP Oil catastrophes, they did it post 9/11 on the air quality, they sat on the lead info for Flint Water, to name a few. It’s safe to say the EPA is protecting corporate stakeholders, not the people or the environment. #EpicFail
7291 2018-11-16 22:43:29 Based on the pic I thought you were going to highlight the danger of non-native trees like palm & eucalyptus going up like torches while spraying burning oil on their surroundings. Nope. Just another bs climate money article.
7292 2018-11-16 22:43:19 do u think my parents will get me cbd oil for christmas if i tell them my therapist recommended it
7293 2018-11-16 22:43:17 I want a man who gives me the same amount of attention that mechanics  give me when I go get an oil change
7294 2018-11-16 22:43:12 The snakeoil salesman is dissolving into snake, oil and madness.
7295 2018-11-16 22:42:54 @chevrolet If you have a 13' Equinox that has excessive oil consumption, please file a complaint with FTC @ 202-326-2222. They suggested I relay the message. Recall on 10'-12' models with same motor and issue.
7296 2018-11-16 22:42:50 Yeah its pretty neat. You use waste cooking oil(like peanut or canola), a couple of enzyme ingredients, and heat and it makes a good(if a bit dirty) fuel.

7300 2018-11-16 22:42:18 AFAIU, this is cumulative "lost" GDP. But:

1. It looks like the "oil" effect goes down. Can't be in a cumulative chart.

2. In any case, it assumes the GDP growth would've miraculously recovered after oil grew a bit back. Impossible.

(Anyone saw the full report?)

7302 2018-11-16 22:41:45 You are in luck.  The peanut oil made in the US is so processed even anaphalactic peanut eaters are safe.  ;-)
7303 2018-11-16 22:41:40 omg it’s actually my personal goal to always smell good! i think i smell like soap and coconut oil lol
7304 2018-11-16 22:41:38 You’re the one being disingenuous. Valero in QC and NARL in NL also import foreign oil. Alberta has imported distillates from Saudi for mixing in pipelines. We import a lot and the market shifts constantly.  It’s a perfectly rational national policy discussion.
7305 2018-11-16 22:41:30 Hey Doug maybe you could become the hero of Canada and get our oil to foreign markets from Hudson Bay?  Win win for everyone...
7306 2018-11-16 22:41:26 I always crave oil down  (Trini oil down that is)

7312 2018-11-16 22:41:00 Which I agree with. Marody has way more potential. It’s evident from his limited NHL viewings

7314 2018-11-16 22:40:57 Taking the LSAT tomorrow and I’ve never been more anxious. Never thought I’d say this, but here I am.

I will literally rub any essential oil anywhere, as long as it gets me to chill out.
7315 2018-11-16 22:40:44 What tax loops, please specify.  Oil subs is 2T, farming is 600B. Still short 10T.  Keep trying

7317 2018-11-16 22:40:37 American donnys making ordinary things so freaky. Lol!!

And why didnt oil up to their elbows? What a waste.
7318 2018-11-16 22:40:25 Point to make too:  the CEO of ConocoPhilips has asked for a carbon tax, Shell spends the most of any Big Oil company on Renewables - so really, it is good to check who is doing what to further a more sustainable future....but still, we need BOLD ACTION still.

7324 2018-11-16 22:40:03 Read..The coal miners’ strike came just after the Oil Crisis of late 1973, when OPEC, (Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) the most important supplier of oil to the West, started an embargo which caused a drastic increase in the price of the vital commodity.

7327 2018-11-16 22:39:50 PSA: Olive oil is an EXCELLENT and way healthier alternative to butter, especially on popcorn, potatoes, steamed veggies, etc. 
7328 2018-11-16 22:39:49 Wind is big here; very big. Although Texas produces oil and gas of course, it also produces a lot of wind energy, and the solar potential is large.
7329 2018-11-16 22:39:40 Eliminate all tax loopholes, subsidies to oil companies, farm welfare, absurd tax abatement to name just a few.
7330 2018-11-16 22:39:32 Please pack some oil...and maybe some DerpAlert as well. 
7331 2018-11-16 22:39:30 Which gave us nothing since he couldn’t even score
7332 2018-11-16 22:39:25 I’m a huge supporter of CBD oil and have never actually tried it lmao. I’ve seen it do so much good for so many people but then I never seem to have the extra cash flow to order it for myself.I’ve told so many people about it... lol whoops.Guess I should get on my own bandwagon
7333 2018-11-16 22:39:03 How do I know this ? Because it's played out in every oil boom town since spindle top.
7334 2018-11-16 22:38:32 I just got a oil change and this mf tryna show out accelerating all fast and shit
7335 2018-11-16 22:38:31 Military style... must mean it is leftover from Vietnam and will break if you don't oil it every hour.
7336 2018-11-16 22:38:23 I’ve been using copaiba oil mixed with clove oil! It’s been a lifesaver. I can put some in an empty bottle for you!
7337 2018-11-16 22:38:19 i got like 2yrs left of free oil changes so it really be no excuse to not get it done 
7338 2018-11-16 22:38:18 Do robots nut oil?

7340 2018-11-16 22:38:13 So how was he able to give "free" stuff, just with the oil. You know that's not true. But you didn't use insults like others do, so I'll just say, we agree to disagree. I have too many Venezuelans living here in Miami that would disagree, but thanks for the civility.
7341 2018-11-16 22:37:57 Palm oil is very high yield per acre.  How would you replace palm oil and what land will you designate to grow the replacement crop?  I am asking because a replacement is needed.
7342 2018-11-16 22:37:56 Bills paid up, oil change, tank of gas, and some extra 
7343 2018-11-16 22:37:49 Try some organic rosehip oil 
7344 2018-11-16 22:37:45 @thorntonschocs why are you still using palm oil in your products? Disgraceful @rickygervais @IcelandFoods
7345 2018-11-16 22:37:43 My car was just ticking but I put gas in it and got an oil change. Make it make sense
7346 2018-11-16 22:37:23 I mean that's sad! Over a jar of whipped egg whites and oil! 
7347 2018-11-16 22:37:23 Jsjsjs honestly, have to battle them in the spirit with those verses, anointing oil on your head in case they try and fight back in the dream too

7351 2018-11-16 22:36:36 We are doing but it is not highlighted in western media as it should be but  doing so will be a loss for politicians. if people start seeing good in each other and become friends, then how to sell weapons how to invade for oil how to put the puppet government in other countries.
7352 2018-11-16 22:36:35 So my oil pan busted on Wednesday at work and my grandpa’s transmission just went out beside our job site. Gotta remember to hang tight because the week isn’t over yet. 
7353 2018-11-16 22:36:28 ah ok i was like for a wooden dildo or what. i’m afraid i don’t know. maybe mineral oil? but that’s probably not something u have on hand :/
7354 2018-11-16 22:36:09 Its straight cbd oil placed into a carrier oil-usually coconut oil or hemp oil. You place usually 1 ml into your mouth & simply drink it. Or you can dillute it into anything you’re drinking or eating. It can be tasteless too.

7357 2018-11-16 22:35:42 Oil subsidies... ok. 2T there.  Still short 10-12T.
7358 2018-11-16 22:35:34 #iesjandiaclimateaction  Humans are the main cause of climate change. Fuel cars generates a lot of pollution of both gases and oil. There is also deforestation which erases trees, wherefore, less oxygen is produced. 1/2
7359 2018-11-16 22:35:27 1 day left to protect the #rainforest, #orangutans, and #palmoil workers from greedy companies like @Indofood! RT to tell @RSPOtweets, the global palm oil body, to vote to stop certifying destructive palm oil in its new Principles and Criteria #RSPO #RT16

7363 2018-11-16 22:34:07 And the drop in oil prices and the end of the summer driving season has nothing to do with it.  You going to take credit everytime the sun shines?
7364 2018-11-16 22:34:00 Yeah it's problematic all right.

It's looking more and more that  college kids nowadays on the liberal-left have an IQ of a kindergartener.

7367 2018-11-16 22:33:13 Reduce the tax cut for the extremely rich and use that money to pay for Medicare for all. The ultra rich don’t worry about the cost of their healthcare and they can well afford an increase in their tax rate. Also, eliminate subsidies to oil companies and the farm welfare.
7368 2018-11-16 22:33:11 I smoke 2 turkeys for Thanksgiving.  One is injected with garlic and olive oil.  The other bird is seasoned with salt and pepper.  

I put them on my Traeger at midnight with a target time of 4pm the next day.  I put them in a tin and "tent" the bird. 

It's incredible....

7374 2018-11-16 22:32:11 They ARE taking it seriously. This is what @gmbutts called for at WWF. @cathmckenna still campaigns against our oil industry. They are duplicitous, anti-progress, anti-human misanthropes. They must be removed from office. #cdnpoli

7414 2018-11-16 22:26:03 So when I got my oil change today the guy handed me a sheet of serviced that are passed due?????????????? How many things do you need to do to your car lmao
7415 2018-11-16 22:25:55 Our share of oil tax receipts are included in GERS. Exports have little to do with tax revenues.

Now answer the question posed...
7416 2018-11-16 22:25:44 This is not true. Having worked on this legislation I can definitively say that those companies did not write the legislation. The bill put in place an 80% reduction in carbon pollution by 2050. Oil cos. activated against the bill b/c it was so much tougher than anticipated.

7421 2018-11-16 22:25:08 Hate razor bumps? Of course you do. Next time you shave, heat the the hairy area, massage in the shaving cream, use a sharp razor and go with the grain. Exfoliate the area and follow up with some tree tea oil. Boom! #NoMoreRazorBumps #SmoothShave #MensGrooming
7422 2018-11-16 22:25:07 I assume Ford will be there to accept responsibility when oil prices increase, or refineries go offline, and gas prices increase?
7423 2018-11-16 22:25:00 Today, @AssembleeNat passed a discriminatory amendment banning palm oil in biofuels. Small farmers around the world call on President @EmmanuelMacron and @Senat to condemn & reject this unjust measure

7445 2018-11-16 22:22:48 WTF!  Oil demand is growing, yet in Canada we’re losing up to $100,000,000 every day.
  Heavy oil = $60.83
  Heavy oil = $65.78
  Heavy oil = $62.02
  Heavy oil = $67.38
  Heavy oil = $14.68
 Northern Gateway, Energy East & Trans Mountain were all solutions.
7446 2018-11-16 22:22:40 From a conspiracy theory point of view what you say seems reasonable however if you had any clue about who owned what over here you would know that the 'West' companies own a small % of the oil and gas industry. Russia huge investor here they pay large $ for privilege. Facts eh?
7447 2018-11-16 22:22:34 @realDonaldTrump they have poor performance and should be blamed. All sanctions are back and the law must be fully implemented, in the next six months, Iran's oil should be completely cut off, they mocked everyone

7462 2018-11-16 22:20:16 If you’ve been bearish on oil the past few years, you’ve looked pretty smart a couple times.
7463 2018-11-16 22:20:01 It might be the oil in the cars. They doing sum with that oil.
7464 2018-11-16 22:20:00 Hal smiles and goes back to rubbing his hard wood with oil.
7465 2018-11-16 22:19:50 All these sanctions are doing is keeping the price of crude oil high.
7466 2018-11-16 22:19:31 The 2018 Ural gear up.  Inspect valves evey oil change. My BMW GS goes over twice that far before even getting an oil change.

7473 2018-11-16 22:18:18 On a proportional basis I would say that the transition from horse drawn transport to cars was one such a historic change or the introduction of electric lighting to replace coal gas and whale oil lighting. Would your views be different once fusion power is commercialized??

7483 2018-11-16 22:16:45 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
7484 2018-11-16 22:16:36 Aku pernah baca cuma pake basicnya aja. Paginya cuci muka pake air aja ngga usah pake fw terus habisnya pake sunscreen. Malemnya double cleansing.

7486 2018-11-16 22:16:32 Where are all these phony green jobs you keep talking about? The energy industry is in the toilet, net price of oil is lowest in years. You are strangling the west and not replacing lost jobs. It's a giant hoax. Liberals gone 2019.
7487 2018-11-16 22:16:29 Soo many positive inputs- I might be off point please don’t judge me. For people going through chemo( cannibus oil ) has cured many people of cancer, people never give up. Always believe in the Lord above, I believe (illnesses)it gives you time for repentance of sins.

7489 2018-11-16 22:16:11 A ban on palm oil is yet another bandwagon for companies/people to jump on. Countries that cut down forests at an alarming rate are doing so to earn money. If you ban palm oil another industry chops down trees for yet another reason. we need to solve the root cause. DISCUSS
7490 2018-11-16 22:16:07 Look cupcake, Texas is BUSY. Jobs, economy is good, oil & gas rockin' as is manufacturing. We don't need several of your plants "to bring work and support." You think we're stupid? Some families here since the 1600's like Florida. I can't believe your arrogance/haughty attitude.
7491 2018-11-16 22:16:03 Changin my oil dis shit was long over due
7492 2018-11-16 22:16:01 Going to try very hard to avoid consuming anything containing palm oil from now on.
7493 2018-11-16 22:15:58 I have a peanut butter which does not contain palm oil, it's made with coconut oil. I'm sure we could use it in more products.

7497 2018-11-16 22:15:11 Yeah... only 97% of scientists have warned us. They don’t call the @GOP the Gas & Oil Party for nuthin’.
7498 2018-11-16 22:15:08 I'm pro choice and have always been. No it isn't murder. Murder is driving your kids into a lake or putting them in an oil tank. Murder is beating a child to death. Murder is a drive by shooting. Abortion nope. Planned parenthood for those that want a child and those that don't!
7499 2018-11-16 22:14:55 Have to say, the GT86 is pretty good for that too. Nice large tach, digi gauges for volts/water temp/oil temp (the latter *far* too uncommon these days) and a driving position that makes them perfectly visible.

7510 2018-11-16 22:13:55 or realistic ...watch US production decline in Dec (because of tax reasons...a yearly occurrence) A bottle of vodka says the media will say this is because of lower oil prices and shale is in peril
7511 2018-11-16 22:13:53 My grandpa washed my car for me this morning and gave me money to get my oil change :’) luv him s’much
7512 2018-11-16 22:13:33 This girl on my insta always posts stories while she's driving, and her dash BEEN telling her the oil is dangerously low. I'm gonna say something
7513 2018-11-16 22:13:29 @LidlUK  hi just a quick question, can you tell me if the palm oil in Lidl own products is from a sustainable source. Many thanks Jo
7514 2018-11-16 22:13:20 i feel so bad for the people who change my oil because they also clean and vacuum out my car and it’s so dirty right now 
7515 2018-11-16 22:13:12 Most have substitutes; the issue is green house gas emissions destroying the climate and the earth in the process. Can you eat plastic? Can you drink oil?
7516 2018-11-16 22:13:04 @EvilMopacATX suggestions for dinner include: oil, premium, of course, money, hubcaps, scooters.....

7518 2018-11-16 22:12:41 if her factory can get all these now,  it will fetch her oil well in no distant time.
7519 2018-11-16 22:12:40 I haven’t ever juiced them. I sauté onions, garlic, and mushrooms in some olive oil with red pepper flakes. Then Add some stock and simmer until they’re tender and the liquid is reduced considerably. Pot liquor is a savory drink.
7520 2018-11-16 22:12:37 Which oil sands companies are foriegn owned? Royalties are paid to alberta and canada
7521 2018-11-16 22:12:27 Acne is probably related to stress and sex hormones, try not to worry too much if you can. Cut out sugar and avoid sunburn. The products probably don't work very well, just use vegetable oil soap and rinse thoroughly. Acne is poorly  understood, more science is needed.
7522 2018-11-16 22:12:12 Oh yea im a pretty cautious person anyways, but I am using the same style of pen and same exact oil that ive already tried so I have a little bit of a metric
7523 2018-11-16 22:12:09 Who does even crave oil down? Oh it’s me. 
7524 2018-11-16 22:12:06 Wow, that almost comes off as being slightly concerned. I assume you have long since sold any holdings in Canadian oil companies?

7531 2018-11-16 22:11:41 Totally wrong!They established their capital Raqa in Syria long before they have been defeated in Irak& started to steal Syrian oil for funding their crimes under the eyes of USA the protector who did not move a thumb!Only Russian intervention stopped that.

7535 2018-11-16 22:11:28 Beyond excited to come home again on Tuesday, know I’ll get looked after rather than fending for myself and setting the fire alarm off and burning my hand on oil....
7536 2018-11-16 22:11:20 Karuvadu taste so much better if it's fried in the oil that you fried the mour milagai. Then mixed with sauteed onion, mustard, and cumin, curry leaves. 
7537 2018-11-16 22:11:14 All I can suggest is those electric oil radiators, we have one super-noisy electrical wall unit in our apartment, and the radiator in the bedroom is a godsend.
7538 2018-11-16 22:11:02 Just a Photoshop oil paint filter + layer mask to make more contrast.
7539 2018-11-16 22:11:01 what's oil got to do with it. in 10 15 years time we will all be driving Tesla and our homes will. be running of renewable energy. Scotland and Wales don't accumulate enough tax to pay for any of there tax schemes. like uni in Scotland is free. will it be after no uk. I'd say no
7540 2018-11-16 22:10:56 This is RIDICULOUS. Gas prices in Edmonton just shot up 30¢ a litre! 

How can this not be viewed as gouging? Oil being $13 a barrel in Alberta and the fear of production being cut back, let’s pass it on to the consumer.

7542 2018-11-16 22:10:40 I like acid exfoliators more than physical scrubs. Something like pixi glow tonic. Would also use alongside a moisturizer (I use one with spf during day and one with vitamin c overnight). You could also incorporate a facial oil or serum like a vitamin c serum or rosehip oil.

7557 2018-11-16 22:09:16 They use government to suppress others, but they don't *need* government. As I said, they hire private thugs. Oil companies are doing it right now in Africa, forcibly taking land from people there with private armies. Capitalism requires exploitation of others, not freedom.

7562 2018-11-16 22:08:40 It’s equally the same  May differ according to branch location at times but idk if to much oil inhalation be fkn up their customer skills 
7563 2018-11-16 22:08:37 Starting with 650ml let’s see what amount I get from extraction oil through distillation! Alcohol 90 proof!
7564 2018-11-16 22:08:36 "US Oil Has Three Days of Stability Against Six Weeks and 30% Of Trumble" Calling a true recovery for crude oil owing to a three day steadying is extremely risky against the backdrop of a near 30 percent collapse for the commodity.
7565 2018-11-16 22:08:28 It really kills me. But I think Nigeria's number 1 export is pastors.... maybe after oil
7566 2018-11-16 22:08:20 I’m am hearing that part of the move in Oil and Natural Gas was the hedge funds unwinding their long Oil short Natural Gas positions.  If that is the case you should see some reversion on both.  #oil #naturalgas
7567 2018-11-16 22:08:18 It's about price & quality. While WTI $10 under Brent is a big help, China refinery fleet isn't geared up for US shale light oil as far as I know

7570 2018-11-16 22:07:49 Norway Oil wealth fund now worth over $1 Trillion USD made more money last year than the ENTIRE SCOTTISH Budget and the amount Westminster claims to spend on our behalf.

7573 2018-11-16 22:07:40 Well they'd have to relocate Trident (poor Wales!), and do without any spends from Scottish oil
7574 2018-11-16 22:07:34 wouldn't that in the good old days been left wing thing, you know big money land grabbing for large scale construction projects.or gas and oil  pipelines,
7575 2018-11-16 22:07:29 But European side is most speculative, weak housing, oil and China demand more firm
7576 2018-11-16 22:07:25 Low oil price hits inflation numbers though doesn't it?
7577 2018-11-16 22:07:19 So why do you support the oil industry?
7578 2018-11-16 22:07:09 It's in the school's best interest for you to believe their policy can't be challenged, but squeaky wheels get the oil.
7579 2018-11-16 22:06:50 Friday, off work early, payday, haircut, oil change, car wash and a full tank. I’m in my bag right now

7581 2018-11-16 22:06:22 Not yo mention the fact that Alberta and Sask pay the highest carbon tax? Our oil industries are decimated? BC LNG will double their Carbon ft print? Quebec’s Bombardier cement plant pollutes as much as Shell Fort Mac!

7596 2018-11-16 22:04:50 LISTEN TO ME! Just because you have oily skin does not mean you don’t need to moisturize daily. Moisturizing is actually the best way to combat oily skin because your skin will naturally produce less oil if it is hydrated

7606 2018-11-16 22:02:59 Let's hope #pnpcbc host @VassyKapelos will inform Canadians the tarsands is privatized and the revenue for oil goes to the (mostly) foreign-owned oil companies, not to Canadians or our govts.

She didn't last show.

7613 2018-11-16 22:02:12 It’s only been banned because it was originally for Greenpeace and has policital influences. If it wasn’t made for them originally it would be allowed to be showed. It was all a marketing stunt. 

But, I’m glad it’s highlighted the palm oil trade as much as it has Iceland

7642 2018-11-16 21:59:25 I'm sure he does to you! People who understand the nature of a threat often seem insane to people who don't. And bad news, it's only going to get worse. Young people see a Democratic Party happy to take oil money and do the bare minimum, and they're not going to be quiet about it

7646 2018-11-16 21:58:42 I think that's the general gist of it. Palm oil helps extend shelf life of products (so reduces waste and environmental impact) but can and needs to be produced in sustainable ways.
7647 2018-11-16 21:58:35 was he not a lobbyist for oil and gas/coal or something?
7648 2018-11-16 21:58:35 Probably never.  DDGS (or modified for that matter) is 25% of the revenue versus ethanol at  70% of revenue (Corn oil and CO2 make up the rest).

7653 2018-11-16 21:58:19 Was recommended @acurebeauty by another. Looks promising, particularly the Rose Hip oil.

7665 2018-11-16 21:56:22 There’s a way over-surplus of recycled plastic that is more expensive to process than just making new plastic out of crude oil. A main problem with single use bags was the litter!

7698 2018-11-16 21:52:53 You’re welcome. Our issue is too much produceable known supply of cheapish oil and not enough carbon budget.  The ideas from the 2000s when we thought we running out of oil don’t apply any more. Time for enviro leaders to admit it so real solutions develop

7715 2018-11-16 21:50:47 Except, no? Their horrific disaster was caused by colonialism, followed by that sort of trap in which leadership focuses only on quick oil sales to beef up their military to crush political opposition. No economic system solves growing up in a broken home and becoming a gangster.

It is definitely being read into by us because of the spin from the post. Urban renewal can occur outside of the whims of capitalism/free market.

7739 2018-11-16 21:47:04 2. Now the production went up as expected and all governments knew. Where do you put it now with lack of pipeline capacity. On rail? Great idea. There isn’t enough rail capacity either not to mention taking rail space for oil hurts farmers.
7740 2018-11-16 21:46:57 Except everyone has to buy oil in USD right? So it kinda underpins the cost of everything else surely? And wasn’t there some big financial event in 2008 anyway? So maybe a 15-20yr view would be interesting
7741 2018-11-16 21:46:49 Surely there’s a suitable substitute to Palm Oil.
7742 2018-11-16 21:46:48 Yo fam just wanted to let y'all know we got real gas grade A strain all together with vap oil dm me if u wanna get down into some gud biz

7744 2018-11-16 21:46:37 2 choices. Brexit on the best terms possible ala May deal that is not what the snake oil salesmen promised or cancel Art 50 and be prosperous whilst addressing the issues caused by UKGov  not the EU.
7745 2018-11-16 21:46:33 The maker of Cadbury chocolate bars, Oreo biscuits and Ritz crackers is accused of destroying tens of thousands of hectares of orangutan habitat in just two years for palm oil.
7746 2018-11-16 21:46:29 Right! All this “say no to palm oil” stuff... palm oil itself isn’t the problem, as long as it’s ethically and sustainably sourced. There’s no need to boycott ALL products that contain it.
7747 2018-11-16 21:46:29 Check out how biased the Koch brothers and oil companies are.
7748 2018-11-16 21:46:13 Except there are other materials to make signs from yet they selected the one made from oil. That goes towards both how much they think through their own protests and the value of the thing they're protesting.
7749 2018-11-16 21:46:06 That is terrifying.  Can’t pay me enough money to go out on them oil rigs.  You must have to be half nuts.

7755 2018-11-16 21:45:02 “You can get free oil change for life”
7756 2018-11-16 21:44:57 Because these things don’t work in the free market. They barely last when subsidized by the tax payers. Oil all the way! Keep it coming!
7757 2018-11-16 21:44:43 You right they do matter & your little booty is just lifeeeee ! *Grabs Oil*
7758 2018-11-16 21:44:38 The most effective long-term strategy is to reduce the value of oil by replacing it with non-toxic sources of energy. The US could own the technology of that new energy sector if our politicos thought beyond the ends of their noses.
7759 2018-11-16 21:44:36 Right, because the world price of oil and the US and Mideast supply all hinge on the Cdn federal election. Lies, lies, lies Gary. Is that all you have?

7774 2018-11-16 21:43:27 ok lol pipelines spill quite often. can’t stop it because bacterial microfilms slowly break down the integrity of the pipeline. why not renewable energy sources? what is the worst case scenario in oil vs renewable?

7799 2018-11-16 21:41:00 Well let's face it, Big Oil got us here. Its only right that they contribute to fix the damage. But why the interest only now? Colour me cynical.

7872 2018-11-16 21:32:49 Every day Canada spends $10 million on oil from Saudi Arabia. That's more than $20 billion over the last 10 years. 
#Canada has its own oil. We don’t need to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. #StopSaudiOil
7873 2018-11-16 21:32:48 Unc say he making tht special Oil tomorrow so you knw how im rocking this weekend lol 
7874 2018-11-16 21:32:43 Strange people out there . 

Real strange.
7875 2018-11-16 21:32:41 With the United States becoming the world's #1 oil producer over shadows any ditz from the god forsaken place of New York.
7876 2018-11-16 21:32:40 Throw in healthcare, agriculture and oil company interests along with food and pharma and you get an idea why there is such huge pushback against healthy nutrition. I call it "Big Disease". They've bought government, favorable media and research.
7877 2018-11-16 21:32:40 Did you know they are discussing 'Bottom Hole Pressure' on LSE
#ukog    No i shall behave...
7878 2018-11-16 21:32:07 เปิด เรื่องที่ไม่มี เลิฟซีน แต่ ดู แล้วเขินๆ
7879 2018-11-16 21:31:44 Oil companies have a huge reach in the media. Livestock is clearly a carbon-positive industry, and there needs to be change to improve that. 

Burning fossil fuels and government refusing to back wind and solar is the real damage. Shame the focus is misplaced.
7880 2018-11-16 21:31:41 @Carrier My 2 year old Carrier Oil Heater at my house in Illinois is not working. And your dealers don't carry warrantee parts for it in Illinois - we were told told 36 DAYS TO GET THE PARTS! 
My house is freezing, so I am paying $353 for these parts now. 
I expect reimbursement.
7881 2018-11-16 21:31:36 Listening to an old cassette that my dads cousin recorded full of the news of the early 70's.  A Morgans Bank dude says; "Oh but we are replacing manufacturing with oil."  I bet they don't mention that in this 'Great Britain Manufacturing history"
7882 2018-11-16 21:30:57 It more depends on what your selling

7888 2018-11-16 21:30:16 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
7889 2018-11-16 21:30:15 1: Thanks for asking, Jessica. A blow torch and oil pump are allowed in carry-on & checked bags only if they're empty of all fuel & cleaned so that no fuel vapors or residue are noticeable.
7890 2018-11-16 21:30:12 I swear I need a nap all day and then as soon as I get home my ass is wide awake. Gym, haircut, car tires, oil change and eye doctor all in a day. I’ve been up since 2:30 am but that’s fine.
7891 2018-11-16 21:30:07 140 #Calgary companies cannot keep a dead oil and gas horse alive. Why wait for the next flood to remove the carcass; switch to #solar, #wind and battery storage. Better yet, lead the way! #GreenNewDeal #JustTransition #ExtinctionRebellion
7892 2018-11-16 21:30:03 No fella. You havent a clue what goes on. Ask to see adrian and petes share portfolio history. Nothing to hide have they? The only difference is they pissed on my chips and im not someone they can bully in person or otherwise.
7893 2018-11-16 21:30:01 You want to adjust your tin foil hat. Oil is global commodity and sells on benchmarks. Each grade is priced off the benchmark based on composition AND market access. Our oil is landlocked and priced accordingly.
7894 2018-11-16 21:29:51 i need to get some castrol oil or some  this bitch done pulled all my braids out now i got bout 5 bald spots 
7895 2018-11-16 21:29:47 I was very pleased that SS out so much information in that #UKOG RNS. If you compare to what Vonk put in his #Angs RNS there are no figures of how much oil they got out of #Balcombe. Spotted half a lemonade bottle . That's it!

HHDL $1,100,000 CASH so far Tankers talk. 6/2019 ;)
7896 2018-11-16 21:29:34 Getting an oil change

7902 2018-11-16 21:28:52 Beard oil is goooood
7903 2018-11-16 21:28:47 We can differ in opinions, respect our differences and still be friends.
7904 2018-11-16 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
7905 2018-11-16 21:28:35 In a pinch extra virgin olive oil or grape seed oil works. But I usually just buy the oil that is bundled with the balm. Don’t have a favorite brand yet, waiting on them sponsorship deals haha.
7906 2018-11-16 21:28:35 The fem-bot covered in baby oil . I agree.
7907 2018-11-16 21:28:18 Despite the low production this year, I'm a Strome fan. I don't know anything about Spooner, but it's another trade from the "son of someone from org, former oil king, played in the Mass area, former Chia draft" bin. Yawn.
7908 2018-11-16 21:28:10 5min oil change/Take 5 is my favorite joce.
7909 2018-11-16 21:28:05 Gov't policy has put AB in a position that its oil, only place in world its happening, is selling for $15/bbl when the same quality Mexican oil is getting $70? Royalties to Ab and CANADA are $billions less than they should be: hospitals, Drs, schools etc. stupidity
7910 2018-11-16 21:27:56 What is your prediction for long-term oil demand?
7911 2018-11-16 21:27:52 Girrrlllll I can’t be held responsible for the aftermath of my massages. Don’t say I didn’t try to warn you. Warm oil aromatherapy and these paws  sorry I’m tutting my own horn 
7912 2018-11-16 21:27:52 man my oil change too highhhh
7913 2018-11-16 21:27:48 To me this is a shuffling of the deck chairs. Oil move out a decent PK player, struggling offensively for a better face-off guy (smaller sample)  with more speed.  Even money deal for a player P.C. was familiar with.
7914 2018-11-16 21:27:46 Wife makes the best chili rellenos on the planet! Roasted and peeled Hatch green chillies stuffed w cheese and a little chicken or ground beef. Dip em in whipped egg whites and saute them in olive oil. Top w more cheese or sour cream. Getting me a little hungry lol.
7915 2018-11-16 21:27:43 U grow the beard o
Drop the name of the oil 
7916 2018-11-16 21:27:32 Hmm I have olive oil now actually n maybe a gram of bud

7918 2018-11-16 21:27:26 once a waitress started spilling hot oil all over my leg and i didn’t say anything to ask her to stop bc i was too nervous so i just sat there getting hot oil spilled on me for like 40 seconds
7919 2018-11-16 21:27:21 This is funny because I was off 2 days and kept putting off my oil change till today , so I can have my lazy days 
7920 2018-11-16 21:27:11 Calf muscles drowning in magnesium oil. Save me.
7921 2018-11-16 21:27:10 Nothing like a little honest oil to grease the wheels!!

7929 2018-11-16 21:25:55 I’m not in anyone’s gang, I’m heavily invested in all Weald companies and like most investors here I’m dismayed by all this childish nonsense. Do really think this helps anyone? Step away from the abyss please, try and help those investors you purport to have great empathy with.
7930 2018-11-16 21:25:50 I have to get my oil change today since it’s my only day off but I just want to stay in all day and not do a damn thing

7933 2018-11-16 21:25:50 Don’t drag me, I swear 90% of the flavoring I use is interior with a light salt/oil bath for simple crispy skin.

Granted that’s for Cornish hens because I live alone and will die by my rosemary/lemon style for hens. 
7934 2018-11-16 21:25:36 Why is the oil.... that hot?
7935 2018-11-16 21:25:30 We need Maximus Decimus Meridius to wipe out the Poachers, the Trophy Hunters, the Palm Oil industry, and the @GOP!

7937 2018-11-16 21:25:03 Geez! Thank you for sharing your info l, my test was both urine and by mouth as we handle chemicals so ransoms require those and sometimes require hair analysis ! I had went to HR prior to starting the oil and was given to OK. I hope you are still employed 
7938 2018-11-16 21:25:00 
7939 2018-11-16 21:24:59 Thomas,i cant understand how the conservatives in England,kenney,scheer and Trump claim to be conservative,but are running totally against thier principles and are against free trade, endorse marketing boards,now kenney wants oil delivery quotas,how liberal of the elites.

7945 2018-11-16 21:24:34 Lmao. This line killed me! 

Real masseuses oil up their arms sha.
7946 2018-11-16 21:24:09 Loads of folks may have said this before, but I think what needs to be avoided is #dirtypalmoil as some alternatives to palm oil can be just as damaging to the environment.
7947 2018-11-16 21:24:07 How does that move more oil out of Alberta?
7948 2018-11-16 21:24:01 Cut benefits on natives if oil pipelines can't through.  All of Canada will suffer?  This will only get worse as commodity prices goes bust.
7949 2018-11-16 21:23:49 I accidentally got lit in a dog cafe & debating if this is the best day of my life...(CBD oil tea + Coffee + Dogs...) #FridayFeeling #whoopsimlit #dogcafe
7950 2018-11-16 21:23:42 That oil can go 10,000 miles so it’s more expensive but goes much further
7951 2018-11-16 21:23:37 I'm not sure whether this has anything to do with Aramco. I read somewhere that shale oilers really are in trouble because of cheap oil. Once they repay the loans and cover the costs of doing business there's almost no money left.
7952 2018-11-16 21:23:31 *passes oil refinery n old base*
“ so, if you like lit a match out here — “
- “ you don’t want to do that. “
7953 2018-11-16 21:23:21 Might have had something to do with the establishment/Tories warning that your pension funds were at risk too, as well as your oil and gas.
7954 2018-11-16 21:23:17 I was tryna fry something the other day and I thought you had to boil the oil in order to fry something. So thats the story of how I tried boiling oil
7955 2018-11-16 21:23:03 The strikes were in response to the government wage freeze, imposed after the energy crisis when OPEC tripled oil prices. Unfortunately the Tory chancellor Barber's poor Boom budget before that had triggered high inflation so the unions rejected the freeze
7956 2018-11-16 21:22:51 Did I not get the memo or something? Is it change your fucking oil day? 
Because we’ve been nonstop at work all day with oil changes
7957 2018-11-16 21:22:49 Cream colored Shea butter with avocado oil is my product
7958 2018-11-16 21:22:43 baby oil is even better

7964 2018-11-16 21:22:14 The hatred among India's "liberal" for Modi is such that they would spin stories from thin air,if that is what it takes.Badhai ho @padhalikha! Your interns are burning the midnight oil to ensure that the gaddi returns to damily's pidis.
7965 2018-11-16 21:22:12 Im not worthy of him now Roag. I asked him to unblock a big Ukog holder here who is a very nice person. So he blocked us both. I have only ever supported Ukog and Adrian.
7966 2018-11-16 21:22:06 Oh, so one of the oil companies I mentioned then? Yeah no thanks.
7967 2018-11-16 21:21:59 Calling them Oil Sands, not Tar Sands, is important. These campaign supporters use language to subtly influence. Pipeline=economic growth.
7968 2018-11-16 21:21:52 Sat in oil in work now i have a massive oil stain right on my bloody bum and have to walk round like this til i finish my shift ..... kill me
7969 2018-11-16 21:21:48 Oil demand continues to rise. The world is not changing that quickly. Demand to peak in 2040 maybe. Here’s a question. How do you replace our reliance on liquid fuels?
7970 2018-11-16 21:21:42 i do some oil masks and honestly how you wash your hair is also a big help.
7971 2018-11-16 21:21:41 The 4 digit number, "1202" is a UN dangerous goods code. 
The cargo is 'heating oil, fuel oil or diesel fuel'.

(Future ref: Google "UN####" and you can get the general material name.)
7972 2018-11-16 21:21:25 2 points.

1. On current trends, by early '20s US will b net surplus oil producer, probly net oil exporter. China will b largest importer. Do we expect US to defend China's oil supplies?

2. I expect EV-dominated car market by late 20s. Can PostOil Gulf even pay 4 food imports?
7973 2018-11-16 21:21:15 Just put the oil change place TV on @hallmarkchannel ... Just schooling all these guys on what Christmas magic is

7977 2018-11-16 21:20:53 Ok, I’m down to one player I want to punt off the Oil.
7978 2018-11-16 21:20:53 Ryan needs to read Upton Sinclair, "The Jungle" & John Steinbeck, "The Grapes of Wrath." He'd see how it feels to be an average person in a country w/ no safety nets.  With no regulations on business, human life is its last consideration. Like what oil companies are doing now.
7979 2018-11-16 21:20:47 Steve Bannon is even worse than your usual snake-oil salesman because he himself believes in the snake oil
7980 2018-11-16 21:20:43 Winners Chapel in Jamaica administered anointing oil to children to cure illnesses and instruct parents not to vaccinate their children. They are a danger to society and should be closed by all Governments. Looters of the poor and gullible.
7981 2018-11-16 21:20:42 Yes. Prices are low here in Alberta. And that’s with the carbon tax we implemented. Which is funding innovations in the oil industry. So yeah, it was ALL because of you Dougy 
7982 2018-11-16 21:20:25 I heard if you use premium oil you won’t have to clean the gun as much
7983 2018-11-16 21:20:24 12 week low in GLOBAL oil prices.  Thanks @fordnation.
7984 2018-11-16 21:19:56 May all of the Victorian lamps used to light your home run out of oil #CurseReesMogg
7985 2018-11-16 21:19:49 I’m getting an oil change tomorrow and I’m weirdly excited about it. Also killing two birds with one stone cause my tire pressure is low and I know they’re gonna take care of that for me too lolol
7986 2018-11-16 21:19:47 back pack boy’in it, hash wax oil’in it
7987 2018-11-16 21:19:45 I volunteer with a group setup to help homeless and other veterans with issues, this last year we started helping ex-emergency services, oil workers and fishermen. The numbers in need of help are growing fast, and this is in one of the richest areas of the UK.
7988 2018-11-16 21:19:39 So you think someones worth is by the number of followers? Jesus! You are either a div or one of adrians trading gang laughing at the honest ukog investors which are getting trapped by rampy bollocks by people who have zero experience in oil industry or finance. So yes fella.
7989 2018-11-16 21:19:33 When four dudes pull up next to me putting oil in my car asking if I need help 
7990 2018-11-16 21:19:29 Not big on grains, but serve it with ice cream and slap some old fryer oil on it?!
7991 2018-11-16 21:19:28 This is very interesting but not that useful. I can’t choose between a log burner to heat my home and a car. I understand the value of quantifying the pollution and this is extremely important but do you have comparison against other heating methods eg oil, gas etc?
7992 2018-11-16 21:19:27 Get the 100% oil.
7993 2018-11-16 21:19:22 It’s capitalism that is destroying it. It’s capitalism that brought it to its current state. Same thing with Iran. The need for Exxon to have its oil placed a fascist dictator as their leader. Now they’ve evolved into what everyone complains about. The US made them like that
7994 2018-11-16 21:19:17 Yo fam just want to let y'all know we got real gas grade A strain all together wit vap oil dm me if u interested in some gud biz
7995 2018-11-16 21:19:15 Oil is a reality for the next 50 years - you need money to build a green economy - where are we gonna get the billions/trillions to shift to green
7996 2018-11-16 21:19:14 Trump and the Lord are like oil and water they do not mix.
7997 2018-11-16 21:19:10 .@BrunoMillienne @GroupeMoDem Shame on you! Your amendment banning palm oil is an attack against small farmers across the world that rely on it for their livelihood. By doing so, you condemn them to a life of poverty
7998 2018-11-16 21:18:59 gorlech at this time, in places, is like riding on an oil slick when you hit the leaves no matter what the weather
7999 2018-11-16 21:18:56 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
8000 2018-11-16 21:18:56 personally..  I don't know how people can talk about #Christmas as 14 million in #Yemen are dying from #starvation..  #wars everywhere ... OUR False #economy's based on selling #weapons #SaudiArabia #US #War & continue #oil USE is NOT Sustainable ... pretty sure #Jesus would care
8001 2018-11-16 21:18:51 Most days though I just wake up and rub in some oil and that’s good enough. I only wash my beard once a week. Mane & Tail shampoo and conditioner. Originally made for horses, but it works great on my thick hair. I put the balm in after I wash it and it’s still damp. 
8002 2018-11-16 21:18:50 @iceland love it no palm oil mince pies

8004 2018-11-16 21:18:21 Kristian Niemietz speak with forked tongue. His beloved IEA (which employs him) is also home to "snake oil" Singham - he of disaster capitalist fame. Mr Niemietz needs to be directing his fire closer to home.
8005 2018-11-16 21:18:20 What he is saying is 'We are the master race in the UK' & you will do as we tell you. Such arrogance from the 'Snake oil salesman'. Political careers are usually short lived, his time will come.  Never seen so much bile, disrespect & utter hatred to Scotland by UK Government.
8006 2018-11-16 21:18:17 coconut oil worked wonders for me!! especially on the one in the first pic it’ll heal super quick
8007 2018-11-16 21:18:16 According to @RussDallen from Caracas Capital, North Dakota now produces more oil than Venezuela.
8008 2018-11-16 21:18:13 To all Californians dealing with the smoky air!! Adding one drop of a peppermint and eucalyptus essential oil blend in your dust mask will help support lungs and help with breathing.

Thanks Mysty Moon!
8009 2018-11-16 21:18:12 Every oil town has schools, ambulance services (like stars) rec centers, children’s activities, family centers all built with donations from Canadian oil companies. You never see #TrudeauFoundation or #suzukifoundation or dominations from the billions we spend on Saudi oil.
8010 2018-11-16 21:17:57 Stop trying to lead the Dems astray Jennifer. We’re going full eco-socialist. The fact is voters love renewable energy and Medicare for all, and even UBI is picking up steam. We’re sick of subsidizing oil and coal Co.s and huge giveaways to billionaires while workers get shafted
8011 2018-11-16 21:17:57 Lmao.  Damn right.  That oil will get ya
8012 2018-11-16 21:17:49 Oleo is actually margarine, more than fifty years ago, Oleomargarine is how you would have found this named. This was made from vegetable oil, and used as a more economical substitute for butter. When Oleo margarine came out, it originally wasn't even yellow, it was white.
8013 2018-11-16 21:17:42 I’ll rub my body w this oil from the Africans then spray my perfume whewww Chile 
8014 2018-11-16 21:17:39 I highly recommend getting an essential oil diffuser!

8016 2018-11-16 21:17:37 Interesting but I think they could end up counteracting each other. The best way to get people to switch to electric cars for instance is to drive up gas prices but if cheap oil keeps being produced they will keep $ at the pump relatively low.  

Thanks for the respectful convo

8019 2018-11-16 21:17:21 @fbncountdown @LizClaman Great show! Your query w/Barry Worthington into "why don't producers just cut back oil production when prices are low", is a tricky area of the controlling lease terms between the mineral owner & producer & may prohibit production cutbacks due to pricing.

8031 2018-11-16 21:16:32 1500+ followers speaks for itself fella. As this company succeeds, these guys will be long forgotten. UKOG will be phenomenally successful, fortunately for them Angus is a sure bet as well, though to a lesser degree purely on the arithmetic of acreage. @UKOGlistedonAIM
8032 2018-11-16 21:16:22 Is there a minimum depth of oil for *shallow frying ? 
(Is 3 centimetres considered to deep ?)
8033 2018-11-16 21:15:50 Yep Adrian would be great if he stopped deramping other weald oilers like Angus but he just can't help himself so he will and has started his own downfall..shame really as he could really have helped all. Unfortunately he chose the dark side.

8037 2018-11-16 21:14:48 Concerns about slowing global growth haunted the markets this week, erasing much of last week's gains.

NASDAQ -2.1%
Russell -1.4%
Oil -5.8%
Gold +1.2%
8038 2018-11-16 21:14:44 Strikes were because the Tories imposed a pay freeze after Barber's Boom budget triggered massive inflation, leaving the country weak in the face of OPEC when the raised oil prices
8039 2018-11-16 21:14:40 According to the judges, the whales can adapt to any other type of ship, just not a tanker carrying Alberta Crude oil. It does take a special type of stupid to make such a claim. Or an ulterior motive. Almost seems criminal...
8040 2018-11-16 21:14:34 I think #pelosi is unaware of the newish field of renewable fuel and was stuck thinking 100% is impossible,like laura ingram, she couldn't think of how to run jets,very easy without petrol oil
Jet fuel is diesel, we can make jet fuel with bio-diesel and jets fuel too is renewable
8041 2018-11-16 21:14:32 Silver was money back then, you don't know. It is not oil is just a commodity. If you don't like my definition, define it.
8042 2018-11-16 21:14:29 Thinking about getting Sadie CBD oil or CBD dog treats. Please DM me if you have experience with either.
8043 2018-11-16 21:14:24 Yeah, but you can get like 500 mpg with radioactive oil.

8045 2018-11-16 21:14:20 I just got the oil change.  I haven't had lunch yet.  I'm stopping at Chipotle.  Do u want me to bring you something for dinner?
8046 2018-11-16 21:14:06 No oil. It’s fine. Think it’s a short circuit thing. Thing is I usually just have heat on downstairs maybe 1 hr upstairs. Gets too hot. Be fine I’ll sort it next week.
8047 2018-11-16 21:14:01 Just changed my own oil. If you have any questions about anything mechanical I’m sure I know the answer.

8051 2018-11-16 21:13:48 When people come in for an oil change then try to be like oh and I have this problem... I just get the with the $165 diag and its turns right back into just an oil change lol

8057 2018-11-16 21:12:49 We are in trouble because we have gone from your father to those backing a Snake Oil salesman. Backing a Supreme Leader instead of a president because of party affiliation, race, or financial standing is something your father never would have done.
8058 2018-11-16 21:12:45 Easy to be a “full individual” when your grandmother is the president of a bank, you grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii while others that look like you are being oppressed, your stepfather was a wealthy oil executive, both parents & step pop are Ivy League grads, etc

How long will we continue to ignore this problem so oil and coal execs can buy their 5th yacht??
8060 2018-11-16 21:12:39 Not true. The guys losing money on barrels are bitumen producers because of the condensate cost. Cardinal Energy produces Midale and Edmonton Sweet, their "WCS" exposure is actually a medium oil. $ATH.to is a money loser with their Leismer and Hangingstone thermal.

8064 2018-11-16 21:12:17 I’d suggest you want cheap oil so sources like oil sands aren’t economic and carbon taxes at the consumer level to drive the switch. So low to producers, high to consumers
8065 2018-11-16 21:12:12 What about curing people of hiv/aids using anointing oil etc? These African pentecostal churches have caused the death of numerous people including children and should be closed by the Government. TB Joshua left a trail of death in the UK when people stopped hiv medication.

8071 2018-11-16 21:11:27 That’s not inflation. Inflation is a specific monetary phenomenon. The discovery of oil increased the supply of commodities in the world but it has nothing to do with inflation. I’m beginning to think you haven’t read any Austrian economic books.
8072 2018-11-16 21:11:25 Ironically, the Saudis themselves are trying to pivot away from oil, which may be what finally breaks US interest in the regime. And yeah, barring some upheaval, the Senate is structurally out of reach for the foreseeable future.
8073 2018-11-16 21:11:14 She is an appropriately confident expert, who doesn’t need to recite facts in every tweet.  Unlike oil salespeople, she only speaks what she knows is true, and her Followers trust her for that. When she is unsure of something outside her lane, she calls in other experts.

8099 2018-11-16 21:07:58 One is a finite resource that will end one day. Other is a natural phenomena. 
As for cars, tomorrow you could make electric cars if you are making a car, its not a 'basic' resource that you can't change, like oil.

8101 2018-11-16 21:07:56 People canny boycott palm oil without getting criticised for not doing more. One step at a time!

8106 2018-11-16 21:07:31 He could've poured oil or transmission fluid, paint or anything inside the interior of the RAV, anything to try and mask the blood, but no, he settled on just leaving it there, I honestly don't know how anyone buys that.

8115 2018-11-16 21:06:26 I heard this today
Each whale on the west coast that the activists think "might be harmed" with larger oil tanker traffic is costing the equivalent of 180 million dollars per whale.

Let that sink in

8120 2018-11-16 21:05:53 Ffs my car, why you got to start dripping oil from three places? It's going to cost me $1200 to fix, after I spent that much earlier this year to replace the water pump.

8122 2018-11-16 21:05:48 My nose can produce oil used to fry Ram meat wahali
8123 2018-11-16 21:05:45 Many Oil Sands producers, especially in-situ producers, do not want to slowdown, as that means dropping the temperature of the reservoir and losing steam chamber pressure. It can be a long road to recovering production if it is dropped too much... double digit months most likely.
8124 2018-11-16 21:05:38 No oil sands expansion should be pretty well stopped. And that actually is due to cheaper higher quality oil from US fracking. The oil coming on right now is from projects  developed when prices  were higher. High prices=more oil sands
8125 2018-11-16 21:05:32 I've tried avocado oil. Very shiny but apparently works well as a natural sunscreen. But I've also been told to never to put oil on skin before going into the sun so idk if I'm doing this right lol
8126 2018-11-16 21:05:25 That has to be balanced against some measure of commonality--two people have to both relate to each other and complement each other.

Too much similarity, and the relationship will be a like a bowl of oatmeal. Too much difference, oil and water, never truly joined together.
8127 2018-11-16 21:05:23 1 hour if you wrap in aluminum and a cup of oil.

8129 2018-11-16 21:04:24 Depends on the severity of the dandruff I usually use selsun blue and just plain coconut oil but hair composition and scalp sensitivity plays a major part in what works for a person typically the female products will be less harsh and more sensitive on the skin

8141 2018-11-16 21:02:59 La scivolosa trappola Oil Slick è in salita dopo il dramma e la .
8142 2018-11-16 21:02:49 I still do not understand why we do not refine enough of our own oil to sell to our own market. Lower energy costs for Canadians makes Canadians less burdened. Yet that part of the conversation is rarely brought up from my perspective.
8143 2018-11-16 21:02:39 Which hair Dey our headthe one wey Dey there sef na coconut oil and mu irun gun we take Dey Make am grow. Bros leave thing mbok
8144 2018-11-16 21:02:30 i put a new battery in my car and gave her some oil and let me tell ya she is a whole new bitch luv her
8145 2018-11-16 21:02:18 I’d like to know what 2 bedroom apt in nyc comes equipped with water, gas, and oil.
8146 2018-11-16 21:02:18 That’s what I was thinking.  Lead second PP & help breakout Luc.  But I really thought Strome would be a quiet leader for Oil for long time
8147 2018-11-16 21:02:14 Good question
8148 2018-11-16 21:02:07 How is drilling at a nuclear weapons site even on the table?  I fear Colorado is going to regret not passing 112.  Big oil really could care less about our health.
8149 2018-11-16 21:02:01 All I want this weekend is Omega Oil and a few million dollars. Make that happen for me
8150 2018-11-16 21:01:55 Glad I Got My Brakes Done Today I Woulda Never Known I Didn’t Have Any Damn Oil In My Car 
8151 2018-11-16 21:01:54 Yes, and I hope you will investigate Interior Dept. in January & see what professionals (if there are any left!) in USFWS, BLM, & Forest Service think about Zinke handing the dept. over to oil-gas-coal-cows & trophy hunters!
8152 2018-11-16 21:01:52 I just cleaned a 100-year-old oil painting with a diaper wipe. Looks pretty good.
8153 2018-11-16 21:01:51 It was never in place. It’s down because the price of oil is. You had nothing to do with it.   But hey ppl can buy beer till 11pm everyday.   Smokescreens as you give rich tax break and freeze wage increase for our poorest workers.
8154 2018-11-16 21:01:49 lol you could be totally right actually. The lips don't contain oil glands like the rest of your body so no moisture can really effect them but i don't have much lips to begin with but you on the other hand probably have more lip exposed
8155 2018-11-16 21:01:34 Yeah. Let's separate
Then we can charge them tariff on oil they don't use, and they will charge us tariff on all construction material that we use. 
Get your head out of your a&* you dumb prick. Separation is going to put us back, not ahead. BC isn't going to go with you.
8156 2018-11-16 21:01:14 “Jess who was Fidel Castro?”

Riiiiiiggghhhhtttt
8157 2018-11-16 21:01:14 i just biore, witch-hazel with rose water, and vitamin e oil
8158 2018-11-16 21:01:10 Gerald Butts works for the Rockerfellers through environmental groups , Tides foundation,Hewlard to kill Alberta oil
8159 2018-11-16 21:01:06 You’re arguing a separate issue. The issue at hand is Canadian oil prices, exacerbated by pipeline capacity to get product to market, and the economic impacts. This is due to government policy, not industry planning.
8160 2018-11-16 21:00:48 start with the production of this oil , not palm , then maybe the nation will improve its health ....
8161 2018-11-16 21:00:42 i just spent $25 to have Oil of Oregano delivered to my house because my fucking wisdom tooth/gums around it are so inflamed it's the only thing I haven't tried out side of spending 100's of dollars. WISH. ME. LUCK.
8162 2018-11-16 21:00:34 Meanwhile in the #isleofman local politician @juanwatterson wants to increase the cost of living by slapping taxes on sugar and palm oil #autocracy #poverty
8163 2018-11-16 21:00:20 A nice hot back oil rub down from me?? Hahahaha 
8164 2018-11-16 21:00:18 It's getting cold outside y'all. Good time to start oil cleansing!
8165 2018-11-16 21:00:17 @RepMattGaetz Matt,   You are absolutely on the right track about unlocking other forms of treatment for our vets.  Oncologist prescribed chemo for my colon cancer, after two weeks felt it was killing me.  Did my own research and went with canabis oil (CBD/THC) mix.  Cancer free.
8166 2018-11-16 20:59:57 short FLOT long TLT lol

But you have Oil going down, Inflation in EU picking up, China looking shaky, and no inflation and Market correction in US causes might cause Fed to pause, all point to lower long rates in next few months
8167 2018-11-16 20:59:55 Oh yep ....oil is magic.  We’re pretty ‘normal’ except for the egg thing.  Apart from Muddle who will not eat raw meat of any description #StrictlyKibble
8168 2018-11-16 20:59:53 I thought it was because of falling world oil prices... thanks for clearing that up.
8169 2018-11-16 20:59:52 It's bland but the Cubans put mojo onion garlic and olive oil over the top when that's that gives it an awesome flavor or fry and dunk it in mojo
8170 2018-11-16 20:59:47 Just bought a new Volvo V60, that’s me running an oil burner for a few more years at least!
8171 2018-11-16 20:59:43 @MBenzSOrlando if it takes more than 2 hours to change my oil how long will it take for you to answer my tweets
8172 2018-11-16 20:59:40 Took today off: ran around town...changed my oil, changed my spark plugs
8173 2018-11-16 20:59:32 Awesome!! Other provinces take note. Now we just need Ontario to stop importing Saudi oil. We’ve got what you need Doug.
8174 2018-11-16 20:59:29 san e purposely added oil to fire when he was mc for unpretty rapstar because he wanted to see women fight,, this was a sign y'all

8176 2018-11-16 20:59:21 I do not recommend olive oil to heart patients unless it is a bridge from lard and butter to little or none.  I prefer small amounts of organic canola for the omega 3 content and the Lyon Heart Study

8178 2018-11-16 20:58:52 us middle east policy stands on jerusalem and amman and cairo 
riad is important but  not irreplaceable
the usa cares less about middle east every year 

oil in a finite  resource and only turkey and israel have the industrial base to survive economically in the long term
8179 2018-11-16 20:58:49 In many proposed applications, it’s useless. And they are going to obscure the useful ones, if the blockchain community doesn’t kill the snake oil with extreme prejudice.
8180 2018-11-16 20:58:46 McDonald's hot fudge sundae but it's just engine oil and sour cream
8181 2018-11-16 20:58:43 Why blame #Trudeau what is #Alberta leaders doing CEO of big oils companies in AB what are they doing #CDNPoli seems like AB is doing charity work not selling oil #WCS
8182 2018-11-16 20:58:39 I know...but I guess he is beyond help. If God gave him that face as punishment, no surgeon wants to take the risk upsetting God ! Not exactly an oil painting is he?
8183 2018-11-16 20:58:36 and yet Canada's "progressive" PM, @JustinTrudeau, and his "progressive" @liberal_party, have committed us to billions more in oil subsidies, buying an antiquated pipeline to further prop up Alberta's dirtiest & least efficient form of oil extraction - #tarsands. #stopkm #cdnpoli

8186 2018-11-16 20:58:08 say no to palm oil
8187 2018-11-16 20:58:06 layer your hair
avoid bleaching/dying your hair too often
brush your hair by working from the bottom and making your way up
don’t wash your hair every single day (unless it gets super greasy)
use dry shampoo to combat oily hair
use coconut oil to stimulate hair growth
8188 2018-11-16 20:57:53 I’m so annoyed. Not only did my flight get delayed 4 times, a kid kicked on my seat the entire ride. The vitamin e oil in my checked bag busted all over my stuff and now I have $50 uber ride an hour away. Thanks @Delta
8189 2018-11-16 20:57:47 lol dont use the gas burner right behind the one youre cooking something with spattering oil in
8190 2018-11-16 20:57:45 yeah leave him alone you bully...because it's much more sporting to block everyone so they can't see your posts then call them names every day 
8191 2018-11-16 20:57:32 @MBenzSOrlando why do I pay for a maintence package if your going to take 2 plus hours to do an oil change?? Seriously!
8192 2018-11-16 20:57:22 Oil prices at a low?
Umm....
8193 2018-11-16 20:57:16 We're furious with you. We bought a 2017 toyota rav 4 hybrid, our warranty expired and the dealership, cuz only a dealership has the tools now, charged us $300 for an oil change.

8195 2018-11-16 20:57:08 This is what good leaders do! The oil fields of Alberta employee people from every province in Canada. They operate under the highest regulations. Yet our government prefers to hurt Canadians and give billions to Saudi Arabia human rights violators. Senseless.
8196 2018-11-16 20:57:02 imma be a crybaby ass parent. from the day the pastor rub that oil on their head to the day they go off to college to the day they get married like THAT’S MY BABY!!!!! 
8197 2018-11-16 20:57:01 Where I differ from Laurie is that I don't see that nationalising oil and gas companies would help. If anything hinder, give us conflicting incentives trying to keep them going.

8200 2018-11-16 20:56:18 So first you get in the car, start it up & drive it to the nearest auto shop then ask for a oil change.

8202 2018-11-16 20:56:13 @TicketmasterCA I bought 8 tickets to oil kings game tomorrow. Do I gave to transfer tickets or can we all go in from my wallet?
8203 2018-11-16 20:56:07 Oil change before we get on the road
8204 2018-11-16 20:55:50 Take real efforts to make gas cylinder cheaper, pointing out errors in statements of @RahulGandhi won't change the fact that you guys pumped domestic fuel prices to record high levels even though crude oil prices were falling in the international markets.

Whom are you fooling ?
8205 2018-11-16 20:55:48 I guess I should be an adult & get an oil change
8206 2018-11-16 20:55:25 Like it.  Took on small position at alert, added to it after tested lows at 97.35......Ironically, getting oil changed now lookin at WMT across the parking lot...it’s destiny!
8207 2018-11-16 20:55:09 sí, va a ser determinante el rol del oil la semana que viene!!!
y si meten la bendita C.O de una vez
8208 2018-11-16 20:55:08 Oshey ! It’s abt time I get myself some perf oil
8209 2018-11-16 20:54:50 Deep condition your hair once a week (leave it in over night), massage warm castor oil into your roots 2-3 times a week (leave it in over night) & vitamins 
8210 2018-11-16 20:54:46 dad paid for my oil change, isn’t he the best.
8211 2018-11-16 20:54:44 Bitch I can get a bath soak with CBd oil. I can get drinks! I can get rice krispies!
8212 2018-11-16 20:54:31 Most likely foreign owned companies that transport them abroad,recycle n bring them back or....they just use them to sell oil In markets
8213 2018-11-16 20:54:26 You are Hypocrites. MBS and the 110 Billion Dollar Arms deal is Untouchable for US. Just like you need them to increase oil output after Iran Sanctions and of course the Petrodollar. What are you criminals talk about Human rights as if you greedy Zionist slaves would care
8214 2018-11-16 20:54:22 So @kenjilopezalt, making shrimp and grits. Want seared shrimp, cooked ahead. Thinking quick salt, sugar, NaHCO3 brine, dry with hair dryer, toss in oil. Can I sear with propane torch? Or broiler/cast iron better? Want to undercook and finish in sauce. 1/2
8215 2018-11-16 20:54:04 Oh Ben, you'd better not be one of those oil and vinegar people.
8216 2018-11-16 20:53:51 @MBenzSOrlando why does a 2:00appt for an oil change take 2 hours? Just asking?  Are you drilling for the oil? FML
8217 2018-11-16 20:53:33 It’ll end one they run out of oil.
8218 2018-11-16 20:53:29 Sweet. Let’s take the opportunity to diversify and build some solar panels and wind turbines in that dusty windy ass province called Alberta instead of tweaking out every time oil drops which it always does.
8219 2018-11-16 20:53:25 Está fuerte. Real,  spx y oil tiran

8222 2018-11-16 20:53:08 I need to go buy parts for my car & get an oil change
8223 2018-11-16 20:53:06 Foolish city oil team
8224 2018-11-16 20:52:48 Ah ken...44 Billion barrels of oil extracted in the last 40 years...absolutely worthless.

8227 2018-11-16 20:52:27 I’m going for Saddledome for first time too and friends don’t want to wear Oil Jerseys!! I just don’t get it
8228 2018-11-16 20:52:12 Why are oil changes such an adulting feeling. 
8229 2018-11-16 20:52:09 Can’t believe my dad made me go get an oil change by myself like a real adult
8230 2018-11-16 20:51:54 We have killed tens of millions of Arabs over the last 30 years because of oil. Don’t talk about a dozen false examples of fascism disguised as socialism and try to link them.
8231 2018-11-16 20:51:47 The oil drop between the rice and the meat
8232 2018-11-16 20:51:42 Incorrect sir, white garlic sauce is vastly superior to Tzaziki. Tzaziki is “Oh, that’s cool, you threw cucumbers and a few spices in sour cream.” Garlic sauce is whipped garlic and oil. Unreal. Warning, do not eat before any event involving people.
8233 2018-11-16 20:51:40 Lots of oil there for Putin to control and Russians know how to take advantage of crisis they often play role in creating
8234 2018-11-16 20:51:36 No wonder!that was why David Mark had it smooth as Senate President so he used to pour “Oil” on the Senators hands before the bills passed, so he was the one that taught Saraki the “Oiling”method of Winning Senators support that Saraki used to lock down the Senate for 4 months.
8235 2018-11-16 20:51:22 Tea tree oil is good if you have really oily skin or are prone to acne. It’s a good astringent and cleanser.
8236 2018-11-16 20:51:13 And if as an environmentalist I want to reduce FF use and encourage clean energy everywhere and not just stop oil sands I should actually want the price to go up everywhere so that clean energy has a greeter competitive advantage. As long as oil is cheap people will choose it
8237 2018-11-16 20:51:09 What is that he is eating? White rice mixed with palm oil? @BBC_NickCavell please don’t go with the impression that you just had jollof rice.
8238 2018-11-16 20:51:07 Guess what they found in N. Korea? $6-10 in mineral wealth. Guess what they found in Afghanistan? They dropped the MOAB; they found (more) trillions and oil. #Farrakhan #GolanHeights
8239 2018-11-16 20:51:01 God bless Jamaicans for creating Jamaican black caster oil
8240 2018-11-16 20:50:59 They overprice on everything. I only let them do oil changes and filter changes. Any real repairs find someone local
8241 2018-11-16 20:50:54 Yeah 100% and use coconut oil to moisturize afterwards it’ll keep your hair soft and you won’t flake
8242 2018-11-16 20:50:49 2 hour wait for my oil to get changed you know I’m disgusted
8243 2018-11-16 20:50:35 Oilers gonna Oil.

8249 2018-11-16 20:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
8250 2018-11-16 20:49:47 I don't get it they seem sort of like the same player. Is Spooner a faster skater or something that the Oil like? Otherwise they seem kind of like the same player. Strome seemed to have some chemistry with Lucic.
8251 2018-11-16 20:49:43 Everyone that worked in oil and lost their jobs should take the liberals to court they caused this mess and should be held to account this is sicking
8252 2018-11-16 20:49:38 You are very welcome! For when the olive oil freezes over! Hope all is well and Steve is soon home safely. Nick enjoyed his own Nepal expedition. Take care lovely lady! 
8253 2018-11-16 20:49:25 That I can manage *heats up the oil before adding the chips to the hot oil*
8254 2018-11-16 20:49:09 Nonsense! You mean less corporate and billionaire tax cuts for companies stealing our natural resources, like oil, natural gas, water, lumber, without paying taxesa which leaves the middle class to pay all the bills like military, police, fixing roads,bridges,fire department, etc

8257 2018-11-16 20:48:47 See say ur oil been a ride u enuh
8258 2018-11-16 20:48:35 Apparently I needed a tire rotation, and an air filter & something else. BUT I came in for an oil change, they took it upon themselves to do the rest! 
8259 2018-11-16 20:48:32 Not that I think you want to give advice to environmentalist on how to stop expansion of the oil sands but what would have a greater impact?
8260 2018-11-16 20:48:19 My toddler son did something involving some Jo Malone bath oil and a loo. He’s doing well in the workhouse, I hear.
8261 2018-11-16 20:48:04 I use my oil tank for mag mount antennas in my basement radio room lol
8262 2018-11-16 20:48:02 saw a bumper sticker that said "spoiled oilfield wife" with an oil tower thing and i actually wanted to die
8263 2018-11-16 20:47:59 The article kind of contradicts itself. It admits pipelines constraints are hurting prices but also implies stopping pipelines isn't going to help stop oil sands expansion unless the price can be driven even lower.
8264 2018-11-16 20:47:51 Company just laid off all home workers! Got a few companies to work at home for already, Thing is that's e.i till college of next September. Weather its law enforcement or oil rig business out west!
8265 2018-11-16 20:47:49 Here’s hoping that @CadburyUK won’t do so well this Christmas as they use palm oil which destroys natural habitats #Cadbury #PalmOil
8266 2018-11-16 20:47:40 The case of Ecuador is instructive: the regional government of Pastaza province wants to enter into TFS agreements with CA. But local indigenous peoples have denounced that they haven't been properly consulted. Meanwhile the national government wants to drill for oil in the area.
8267 2018-11-16 20:47:35 It's UK oil so long as Scotland remains part of the UK, if Scotland leaves the UK it leaves with its resources also. This is hardly a difficult concept to grasp,
8268 2018-11-16 20:47:34 IMO Trump's love for Saudi Leader and oil is responsible for the starving children and unnecessary deaths in Yemen. Need No Fly Zone and food convoy going into Yemen. Instead troops on our own border doing nothing except obstruction of our own constitution.
8269 2018-11-16 20:47:30 Citadin ou pas, les loyers sont chers en ville ! Au fait, à combien situez vous le bon prix du gaz oil ? L'école, la santé pour c'est bien non! Il faut ajouter le carburant. Cela existe ailleurs ?
8270 2018-11-16 20:47:28 70$ oil
8271 2018-11-16 20:47:26 Indeed, the 'worthless' oil that companies are still frantically searching for - new discoveries of 10s of millions of barrels every few weeks.
8272 2018-11-16 20:47:24 I thought the Trump monster wanted us to come in and steal the oil.
8273 2018-11-16 20:47:14 What's 900,000 barrels of oil between friends....
8274 2018-11-16 20:47:14 This is y I always tell people with tested integrity not to support either pmb or atiku. I made this point to @segalink somtym ago. Pple like sega r wearing white robes n all these politicians have their all body smeared in oil, it’s best to stay far from them.
8275 2018-11-16 20:47:06 Should I be social tonight, or should I stay in and prepoo with some black castor oil?
8276 2018-11-16 20:47:00 In my vegan days I used to eat tofu sliced thinly and fried in oil and soy sauce instead of bacon...
8277 2018-11-16 20:46:39 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
8278 2018-11-16 20:46:35 Is anyone using CBD oil instead of olive oil this year on their turkey?
8279 2018-11-16 20:46:18 Looks can be deceiving, easy to get the wrong impression without looking at the detail! Majority of plants petioles as per one in my hand causing discolour. I guess we can import from Hungary & Romania or rely on palm oil imports. Could be TuYV as not sprayed for aphids.
8280 2018-11-16 20:46:17 Liar!  you do not get to take credit for the price of oil dropping.  I know you're slow on the uptake, but seriously, this is dumb...even from you.
8281 2018-11-16 20:46:13 Whenever I read the phrase “men who identify as women” I immediately think of Silence of the Lambs. I feel sorry for those who suffer mental illness but other arrangements should be made. The squeaky wheel gets the oil way too often re gays etc

8283 2018-11-16 20:46:07 Определённо стоит. Всё выглядит в духе раннего фт. В общем, всей ридмангой молимся, чтобы Машима ничего не завалил, но пока выглядит годно.

8284 2018-11-16 20:46:03 Well done Iceland.Thanks for all you’re doing to save the orangutans and raising awareness of their plight. Other organisations must only use sustainable palm oil. Boycott companies that don’t and don’t buy products containing unsustainable palm oil. 
8285 2018-11-16 20:45:59 Dang where would you rank tea tree oil? that all I've been using.
8286 2018-11-16 20:45:44 Finally changed my oil and I’m procrastinating to put all the plastics back on 
8287 2018-11-16 20:45:41 I FINALLY GOT MY OIL CHANGED
8288 2018-11-16 20:45:35 Don’t forget all the oil used to manufacture his eco friendly cars and used to transport globally

8296 2018-11-16 20:44:33 And so imperialist theft and exploition are done for selfish reasons. U$ & We$ter allies is bombing eight countries not cuz they give a shit about people but cuz they want that oil & don't care how many millions die to get it.

Glad we agree finally on imperialism's true motives.

You are all paid for by oil, coal, suger, and other major industries that stand to lose if laws help people and not them. You rake it in, while we suffer for your greed.

8300 2018-11-16 20:44:09 I'm a bit puzzled by this info. Trump was asking from OPEC, mostly Saudi Arabia, to lower the oil prices because of Midterms. But now he wants higher prices because shale oilers are in trouble with cheaper oil, did I get this right?
8301 2018-11-16 20:44:04 The problem is the price of Canadian oil was set by NAFTA and the amount they can steal as well. And it predated NAFTA. It’s one the the new USMCA has fixed. Oil to the US when/if the agreement is signed has to be bt at world prices. It’s a long ago dirty trick

8306 2018-11-16 20:43:29 I'm obsessed with essential oils! I use a "brain aid" at work to help me focus. Orange oil is said to have antidepressant properties, so I'm trying that. I use lavender to help me fall asleep, and an anti-germ blend to hopefully keep me well this winter.

8328 2018-11-16 20:40:44 Without a foundation of quality education, no sustainable economic development can be achieved.
U need skilled manpower to drive real economic growth. Most of what we call economic growth in Nigeria is more or less increase in oil price.

No power
No quality education

8342 2018-11-16 20:39:06 Well, for starters, if your goal is to get WCS to the Gulf Coast, you should be advocating for Keystone XL, not Trans Mountain expansion, but since Keystone is tied up in Montana courts, it doesn’t fit narrative that the problems facing Alberta’s oil industry are political.

8344 2018-11-16 20:38:40 Relax David, @Fedupmom2018 does not understand Christianity nor foreign policy. She is just fed up with thinking for herself and repeats what she hears her handlers say
8345 2018-11-16 20:38:28 it lacked two important resources in its territory - oil & rubber.  That's why the goal of conquering oil rich Dutch East Indies was such an important strategic one.
8346 2018-11-16 20:38:24 Fun Fact: Ford's first successful cars ran on alcohol, not gasoline. Prohibition was passed by the $$$ from John D. Rockefeller, the oil tycoon.

8348 2018-11-16 20:38:16 I guess you still have plenty of squirrel oil 
8349 2018-11-16 20:38:16 I realize the oil prices play a role, but that exposes how bad it is when you let the government run the largest industry in the country. If it was a private company the shareholders would be losing money, not the government experiencing hyperinflation. /2
8350 2018-11-16 20:38:14 The way your car feels after an oil change is the best
8351 2018-11-16 20:38:10 I think Alberta oil is like whale bait, well as per lefty Judge anyways.

8353 2018-11-16 20:37:47 I’m not sure activists actually know the multitude of uses for oil other than burning it for fuel and making plastics they participate in daily.
8354 2018-11-16 20:37:40 When the government finds weed on your land, its your weed.. when the government finds oil on your land, it’s government oil.

The Government is amazing
8355 2018-11-16 20:37:27 Don't blame importing crude the fault clearly lies in not building refineries in Canada. Imperial Oil is 70% by Exxon Mobil. Just ask @stephenharper Not building refineries in Canada was because Canada did not ban the export of crude like US did for 40 years. 1975-2015
8356 2018-11-16 20:37:24 A few decades???? Are you joking???? In a parallel universe or on a different planet?? We don't have "a few decades" you oil covered jokers

8359 2018-11-16 20:37:05 @VitaCoco I honestly still can't get over how non-refreshed I was after drinking one of your drinks. That snake oil that you've been selling isn't even tasty.
8360 2018-11-16 20:37:02 While the oil is flowing and keeping the interests of these companies and West's demand for oil, there won't be any uprising, as Aliyev has a firm and long hand over his oppressed people, but like many dictators before him, he too will be removed causing more instability .

8363 2018-11-16 20:36:16 1/2 Partial solution is stop CEOs from making 30,000% over their employees, offer healthcare, pensions, & pay taxes to support infrastructure spending and higher education spending. Also stop subsidizing (oil) and bailing out corporations. Stop corporate dark money in politics.
8364 2018-11-16 20:36:14 Do it outside, far away from any structure or anything flammable, be prepared for a 3-5ft fountain of molten oil(worst case), defrost fully and really really make sure the bird is dry, and finally just brine it and bake it.

8373 2018-11-16 20:35:07 Ooh dear,bank roll, have you seen the debt the UK owes. When we go as we surely will the oil comes with us. Let’s see who bankrolls who then

8376 2018-11-16 20:34:58 Remember when George W got us into a war that we are still fighting today, which had nothing to do with 9-11 and everything to do with oil, and lining the pockets of his buddies.
8377 2018-11-16 20:34:47 You don't get it. You haven't even looked into Pelosi. Sorry pal, I don't buy.

8388 2018-11-16 20:33:17 Morneau says there is no magic bullet for Canadian Oil prices. Besides building a pipeline to the coast? no wonder Western Canadians dislike that man so much.
8389 2018-11-16 20:33:09 Is someone gonna explain to me why the Iceland palm oil ad got banned like it's a really good point that we should know more about cause the Earth is fucking dying yanno. Why the silencing?
8390 2018-11-16 20:33:05 If we would stop burning oil the currently known oil reserve would last very much longer. So no real need for oil explorations.
8391 2018-11-16 20:32:53 I’ve heard there is a store in Haverhill that has the oil. But honestly I order my gummies online and 10/10 would recommend if you don’t find anything

8393 2018-11-16 20:32:28 Respectfully Congressman, that's not an argument. The Taliban in Afghanistan have nothing but AKs and drums of oil and they're winning the war against the US and the Afghan government under every measurable metric, even though 'we have nukes'.

8402 2018-11-16 20:31:33 Yep, there's delivery methods other than smoking. Lots of sick people can't smoke or don't want to. 

CBD oil is out now, but it's unregulated by the FDA. There's no guarantee that cannabidiol is even present, or assurance of what dose a person is getting, if any. Nor a standard.
8403 2018-11-16 20:31:22 Silicone lube or coconut oil?
8404 2018-11-16 20:30:57 Exactly my dear. That's food and not rice and oil with some leaves

8406 2018-11-16 20:30:39 on second thought, the glycerine *might* work. humectants need to be balanced out by occlusives, and your hair would be covered in oil, so it might be worth a shot

8413 2018-11-16 20:29:07 So Iqbal after reading all the well written and polite tweets below. What do you think Is it time to join us in making Scotland all it can be for all our families. We can't do it as part of the UK That's for sure 300 years and vast oil wealth has brought us only crumbs of table.

8418 2018-11-16 20:28:54 Will the same telecoms scenario play out in oil and gas?
Can it play out in electricity?
Can we even afford to take such risk of free market where ASSOCIATION of oil marketers will simply sanction whoever sells less than certain amount?
Market driven fuel? I don't think so o.

8424 2018-11-16 20:28:20 The think tank funded by anonymous tax dodgers linked to many other think tanks that the BBC are forced by the ERG to give credence to. The only thing these think tanks do is sell snake oil.
8425 2018-11-16 20:28:20 It has EVERYTHING to do with @fordnation he's removed the cap & trade Wynne slapped on oil, hydro, oil, the whole shabang!!
8426 2018-11-16 20:28:15 the downstream oil sector can only be deregulated and allow for a market driven price when we start local production and end importation with that we know that the effect of global pricing is under our control

8434 2018-11-16 20:27:02 I like to think (perhaps I am hopelessly optimistic and naive) that these issues could be hashed out over pizza and beer. After all, we are not oil company/Detroit execs.

8447 2018-11-16 20:24:55 Small town living when you run into your customers while getting an oil change 
8448 2018-11-16 20:24:51 I change my oil every 3,000 miles. I paid the consequences for it earlier in the year. I paid 2k for a whole new transmission shit sucks man.
8449 2018-11-16 20:24:46 If you kept cap and trade more people could afford electric vehicles and we wouldn’t be so reliant on fuel imports into our province. Less reliance on natural gas and other fuels. Electricity is generated in Ontario. Put more money into low cost generation less to oil and gas.

You're telling me that without crude oil, this Nation will crumble?
8455 2018-11-16 20:23:44 Pepboys are crooks. Everytime i go for a oil change i somehow have to spend money for things that were working fine before i came

8463 2018-11-16 20:22:31 Increasing the budget 45% on one time oil revenue in 10 short years was shortsighted all because Danny wanted to be popular and liked - unions all got their giant raises but none of them questioned the solvency of their pensions with such reckless overspending?

8479 2018-11-16 20:20:31 And for all you geniuses who say this has nothing to do with Ford compare the retail price of gas versus the price of oil per barrel for the past 10 years. You will see that under the liberals the retail price skyrocketed due to taxes.

8508 2018-11-16 20:17:50 Doug - why are you misleading people with this. It's NOT because of ANY thing you have done! International oil prices are down substantially - that's the reason! Why don't you just be honest and straight with people? cc @celliottability #Onpoli

8546 2018-11-16 20:13:13 The struggle of arab oil money is real but she don’t reach those pretty Ethiopians gals 
8547 2018-11-16 20:13:12 Absolutely, the Palm oil industry has become so deeply entrenched that every processed food item has palm oil as it's main ingredient. It's high time to find sustainable alternative before dense forests turn into Palm Oil Plantation forever.
8548 2018-11-16 20:12:49 Filling the swamp. @realdonaldtrump continues to appoint lobbyists for chemical, coal & oil industry into the EPA, the Environmental PROTECTION Agency. 

We have 12 years left folks! Can you imagine Donald being in charge of 6 of those years? We'll all be migrating soon.
8549 2018-11-16 20:12:39 @BCReality @MGarneu _it Let's ship oil to China so they can increase carbon output so we can pay carbon taxes. Brilliant!
8550 2018-11-16 20:12:36 .@Min_Ecologie Malaysia is a leader in sustainability and forest protection. Why focus your strategy on Palm Oil when other commodities such as French rapeseed or livestock are responsible for far more deforestation?
8551 2018-11-16 20:12:35 #Angs Hope Vonk gets more than Half a lemonade bottle of oil out #Brockham.

No tankers were seen at Balcombe. Not even a company photograph of one.  Guess there wasn't any then?
8552 2018-11-16 20:12:25 idk about that... i think you just need to find what works for your hair. like coconut oil made my hair really dry but it works for other ppl... for the longest time my hair wouldn’t grow past my shoulders, and after switching it up, it has, by a lot. so it depends.
8553 2018-11-16 20:12:12 .@Min_Ecologie French Government Strategy’s aim is to push EU action against palm oil (EU Action on Deforestation and RED Deforestation Criteria). This is scientifically inaccurate and will damage trade, jobs and development.
8554 2018-11-16 20:12:07 What I have heard is that palm oil is cheap and that is why it is used. I can do without any products made with it. Reading labels, I have found it’s in a huge variety of products.
8555 2018-11-16 20:12:06 Problem: doing this is leaving US$11 TRILLION on the table. Maybe get OPEC, Russia, and Venezuela to ramp down THEIR production of their oil if you care about the environment.
8556 2018-11-16 20:12:05 Except that Italians, Spaniards, Corsicans, Sardinians, Albanians, and southern Frenchmen along the Mediterranean are also European. 
BAM! 
ArmaOrientalis DESTROYS Dimitris Gennaios with FACTS and LOGIC, sending him HURTLING into another DIMENSION devoid of OLIVE OIL. 
8557 2018-11-16 20:11:24 With the word bellend i would go with uk player? Still an oil level indicator (Dipstick)
8558 2018-11-16 20:11:18 Good for you. You do you. I’m about to eat/drink it all away too. The CDB oil isn’t cutting it today.
8559 2018-11-16 20:11:11 I heard that Eric Abetz wanted it in exchange for his support during the spill. I might be wrong though.

And don't forget Cheney, Rothschild and Murdoch are drilling for oil in Israeli occupied Golan Heights, Syria
8560 2018-11-16 20:10:49 Like seriously! The oil money ooo
8561 2018-11-16 20:10:37 Y’all want liquor or oil ?
8562 2018-11-16 20:10:26 Again, are you actually claiming you control the global oil markets?

8564 2018-11-16 20:10:20 Lately I’ve been writing for a bit before I begin painting each day. Today I flipped back through the last couple months and noticed a small list, sitting mid poem; 

Fish oil
B12-complex
Vitamin D

Not sure what that’s about, but I bet I’d be less angsty if I took my vitamins 
8565 2018-11-16 20:10:16 اهنيك على صدرك الرحب 
8566 2018-11-16 20:10:13 The oil shale is varved, so it fractures along the bedding plane, assisted by the presence of the fossil. It is the richest fossil bearing area I ever encountered!
8567 2018-11-16 20:10:03 Uh, they are. It's nothing to do with Doug but with the price of oil worldwide
8568 2018-11-16 20:10:03 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
8569 2018-11-16 20:09:52 I healthy oil industry has spinner benefits across the country it’s not just tax dollars it also create jobs. Crippling that also affects international investment in Canada. Foreign  companies our wary about investing in Canada now because of things like this.
8570 2018-11-16 20:09:29 U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN SAYS REOPENING OF KIRKUK #OIL EXPORTS FROM #IRAQ IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN EFFORT TO CURB #IRAN OIL EXPORTS
8571 2018-11-16 20:09:28 17th november France will be protesting against Macron , thousands of people are going to block gas stations and trafic. A general protest triggered by the recent rise of the diesel oil price. will probably get  0 coverage internationally  @zillarage @LoyalLogic @pewdiepie
8572 2018-11-16 20:09:08 Oil coming down will lead to lower CPI and ISM numbers as oil services was a huge part. Treasuries will rally in price and possibly the Fed and Trump both save face on further rate increases. But I still think they go in Dec

8576 2018-11-16 20:08:22 @KailLowry When is your baby due? Your baby haircare products that is. I can't wait to try it. Cbd oil is good for my fibromyalgia so it has to be good for my hair.
8577 2018-11-16 20:08:05 I check every label and it’s so difficult to find anything without palm oil. There is a growing number of people who care about rainforests and wildlife habitat who refuse to buy products containing palm oil. Hopefully, consumers will drive an end to companies using it.
8578 2018-11-16 20:07:48  put a dab of it in an oil burner
8579 2018-11-16 20:07:39 Humans, most destructive animals on the planet. 

Palm oil is horrible. I think they can find something else.
8580 2018-11-16 20:07:31 Never thought of this because they seem to have so much oil. Well, it all says over dependence on oil could lead to poverty and make a supposed wealthy nation the skunk of the world. Smh
8581 2018-11-16 20:07:27 who be taxpayer? say wasting oil money 
8582 2018-11-16 20:07:19 I've been wondering if these bat-shit crazy conspiracy theorists, like chem trail goofballs, are funded by the climate change denier interests (oil/gas, industrialist lobbies)... cause why?! Why else would you get involved with this craziness?
8583 2018-11-16 20:07:18 As a data manager supporting the exploration geoscientists in the oil & gas industry, I agree with this 100%. The mission is bunk if you end up at a location that doesn't have the resources you're looking for...
8584 2018-11-16 20:07:12 Oil well 
8585 2018-11-16 20:07:11 Starting a paid signals Telegram. 2ETH for premium channel, where I consult the I Ching and runes, and crosscheck using the intersection of crystal and essential oil energies. DM for link
8586 2018-11-16 20:07:06 Do you also support Canadian oil?  Sure is a lot of Saudi oil and not a lot of progress in pipelines   We need fuel do we need dairy? I don’t.
8587 2018-11-16 20:07:03 Which Glock do you have? I hope there's no oil in the barrel
8588 2018-11-16 20:06:59 Then stop buying dirty Arab oil
8589 2018-11-16 20:06:46 So number one remove the ridiculous restrictions on energy east and get that pipeline built it will prevent more takers coming down the St. Lawrence with oil and it will create jobs in this country.
8590 2018-11-16 20:06:42 Why not just make Mexico out 51st state and be done with it?
We'd get more oil, great Mexican food and excellent vacation places!
In addition, our new southern border would need a much shorter WALL!

8591 2018-11-16 20:06:41 Very good interview by Paul Vonk. He explains very well the processes and time frames required here to reach the potential at #ukog and #angs.
Communication is key here David to keep shareholder's confident and understand the process required to reach the Weald's potential.
8592 2018-11-16 20:06:38 Janice Bissex how does one find your products to order. I'm on cannibals oil through Tilray, but I was listening to you on the Doctors show and was fascinated by what you talked about on the Doctor's Sirius. If it's possible to order
8593 2018-11-16 20:06:35 Doesn't really change the fact that Britain gained this territory at the time, does it? This oil became vital during WW1 and was regarded as a source of untold wealth. Large oil reserves were discovered in 1927.
8594 2018-11-16 20:06:25 So we need to be stupid about where we send our hard earned money just to prove we care?
We've spent tens of billions in Central America over the years only to have them come here by the millions. I'd say it was wasted looking at end results.
8595 2018-11-16 20:06:21 Stop confusing healthcare with health insurance.  Our automobile insurance doesn't pay for oil changes and everyone has it and the majority can afford basic auto maintenance.
8596 2018-11-16 20:06:21 This is not just question producers overproducing. The government deliberately blocked the energies to pipeline. That means we are spending billions of dollars to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. That affects the whole Canadian economy.
8597 2018-11-16 20:06:19 If you go to Jiffy Lube for an oil change, you will likely need more than the $100!!  Pennzoil, why do you support #JiffyFleece??
8598 2018-11-16 20:06:16 You niggas getting raped, you still getting oil base..
8599 2018-11-16 20:06:04 Because his swamp is full of oil drilling fracking coal idiots
8600 2018-11-16 20:05:54 So educate me real quick. 
I got my oil changed & fluids topped off, new engine filter, tires rotated & extra air... what am i missing? I put fuel additives in every so often
8601 2018-11-16 20:05:36 Trudeau’s track record:
>Destroying Native American reservation lands for oil companies
>Funding Ukrainian Neo-Nazis and sending Canadian troops for assistance

These 2 acts alone are enough to make him a terrible leader but he’s somehow progressive for wearing rainbow socks.
8602 2018-11-16 20:05:33 car wash, oil change, filter change ... whew chileeee . i just need somebody who tryna do all this for me 
8603 2018-11-16 20:05:22 Used to live in MS and spend a lot of time in AL. Both are very different states compared to 1865. No collapse of cotton monoculture plantations this time. Offshore oil drilling, major auto and aerospace plants... a new federation of southeast states would do fine.

8606 2018-11-16 20:05:03 wonder if the Nigerian Government would release the required crude oil for Dangote’s refinery seeing as a lot of corruption is abetted by importation of petroleum products
8607 2018-11-16 20:04:54 Since when do we hold people accountable for the actions of others? By that logic the alberta ndp is actively working against the oil sands because Singh is. The desperation stinks.
8608 2018-11-16 20:04:39 Tell me about it...hospitals medicines transport taxes tariffs payments food export and imports oil gas coal ....the list us endless serious is NOT the word.  
Politicians need to get there fingers out now.... sort this mess out ...otherwise let the people vote..
8609 2018-11-16 20:04:38 Trump is just a sort of a fool that will be made look stupid by both oil and equity markets.
8610 2018-11-16 20:04:29 She shakes her head at your cart full of groceries and plucks out the bottle of extra virgin olive oil.
8611 2018-11-16 20:04:19 Naked cooking with oil should be an X games sport.

8624 2018-11-16 20:03:09 @epawheeler why do you want us to have dirty water & air? Is the oil money so good that harming people & our country is worth it?

8630 2018-11-16 20:02:44 It had a lot of oil splatter stains since like an idiot I wore it while cooking a couple of times so I hope whoever it was got those out and is enjoying it
8631 2018-11-16 20:02:39 Thanks for driving down the worldwide oil prices (which are behind the lower fuel prices) with this move....
8632 2018-11-16 20:02:39 Finger detangled and Pre-pood with canola oil because it's the only think around me. Thanks to aunt google I would have slept with 2months dry and neglected hair.
8633 2018-11-16 20:02:38 Get peanut oil, a large pot & deep fry it outside.
8634 2018-11-16 20:02:33 Well I suppose the FDA could do most anything they want.  But I highly doubt they will because the lack of viable medical benefit on deeply understanding mineral oil is too narrow.  You initially poop a little more till you get used to it?  Stop the presses!!  LOL

#MuellerInvestigation
8639 2018-11-16 20:02:21 What is the incentive to undermine the science?  People say big oil but I dont think that is necessarily the case. The big oil companies employ thousands of engineers and they are already working on alternatives because of the political climate.
8640 2018-11-16 20:02:20 It's because we have a surplus of fuel not because of you scrapping cap and trade. Oil is trading at $13.50 a barrel the lowest it's been in a long time. We see through your bullshit Dougie. #ClimateChangeIsReal
8641 2018-11-16 20:02:20 @chigrl @AFP FYI , I sure this announcement is coincidental to announcement KSA charting a new course on their oil policy.
8642 2018-11-16 20:02:19 Privatizing NNPC is the best option, freedom for oil companies to compete which will enhance the oil & gas sector
8643 2018-11-16 20:01:40 Peppermint #essentialoil can alleviate digestive issues, soothe headaches, and calm nausea when taken internally or inhaled, and it also can be used as an effective deodorizer! If you have allergies or congestion, this oil can promote clear breathing from respiratory problems.
8644 2018-11-16 20:01:39 Just think we as Canadians have a share in a billion dollar pipeline that only exists in Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau  mind with a big rejected stamped across it while another Saudi oil tanker pulls into port.

8649 2018-11-16 20:01:20 The re-opening of #Kirkuk oil exports is a positive development for #Iraq and another important step in our efforts to reduce Iran's oil exports. Congratulations to @IraqiGovt and @Kurdistan and to the @USEmbBaghdad team for their hard work.

8658 2018-11-16 20:00:12 Guess that firefighter is one smart dumbass. Asphalt is a oil byproduct with tiny rocks mixed in it. It will burn! Plus fire under a bridge can collapse any bridge. Just look at the bridge in Atlanta a little over a year ago. They are still fixing that due to.....Fire.
8659 2018-11-16 20:00:04 Do you have a chest cold? How about asthma? 

This diffuser blend is gentle and helpful for the respiratory system!

2 drops Cardamom essential oil

1 drop Peppermint essential oil

Give it a try! I think you'll find it very calming.

8666 2018-11-16 19:59:41 How much do you think demand fell in 2015-16, after the supply glut had already brought oil down to 60?
8667 2018-11-16 19:58:58 God knows that is my own opinion since 2015,we should go back to our regions and give the fg 15% shikena,we can be having oil in d south and spending its revenue to the north.
8668 2018-11-16 19:58:50 Nothing. 'We" don't own oil. The free market does and we already let the industry build more than enough infrastructure on our land. They need to sort out their own problems and we need to reduce fossil fuel use not help industry flood the market with dirty fuels. I'm serious too
8669 2018-11-16 19:58:49 He went online and found a coupon for my oil change lol ... his fine self ...  and he want to save me money

The east will only buy 79,999 barrels of oil instead of 80,000 daily?
8672 2018-11-16 19:58:22 I'll watch Senrans later, so I'd appreciate no spoilers, I had to make a run out to do some work and get oil in the car.

8678 2018-11-16 19:57:53 Ah Sir Ian Wood the guy who has multiple answers to the question 'how much oil is left?' depending on who is asking the question.

He really earned his kinghthood 

Big fan of fracking Scotland too. Total fud.
8679 2018-11-16 19:57:50 @realDonaldTrump The banning of bin Salman and Saudi Arabia will never vote, we will never let that happen. Ben Salman is innocent and this is the work of the financiers. With the help of Ban Salman, Iran's oil will be completely cut off. All sanctions must be fully implemented

8682 2018-11-16 19:57:43 I'm not defending taking $ from oil and gas interests, and appreciate that #sunrise is not willing to accept business as usual, neither am I. Just pointing out that he said he is behind the concept of a #GreenNewDeal, and I don't understand focus on a new committee.

8684 2018-11-16 19:57:26 The price of gas is down because of the price of oil not you eliminating cap and trade, lets get that straight. Pretty soon you will be taking credit for why BC GDP is higher then Ontario's

8686 2018-11-16 19:57:16 Does any of them know anything about building vehicles? 3.5 quarts of oil used in between oil changes is not ok!

8688 2018-11-16 19:56:52 This was my question too !!! What became of Sanctions on Iran??
We can’t buy oil and gas from our next door neighbour or do any other trade but hey .. that port is free bcz US is going to use it for carting away mineral wealth of Afghanistan and carting in Ammo for Blackwater 
8689 2018-11-16 19:56:44 I'm getting my oil changed & this salesman just walked by & said "oouuu girl yo hair is laaaaiiiidddd yasss" lmaoo my day has been made cuz I put in work on these baby hairs today 
8690 2018-11-16 19:56:31 I like how you take credit for the record low crude oil prices. Good try though.
8691 2018-11-16 19:56:10 Will the federal government be responsible for paying for the oil used to make the staffers' bronzed bodies glisten, or will your PAC  be covering that?
8692 2018-11-16 19:55:45 I would to if I found out that Oz was literally making me fight a war we couldn't win (unless he worded it wrong and HE can't beat Salem but someone else can)
8693 2018-11-16 19:55:37 What about hiring better engineers to design your vehicle. 3.5 quarts of oil in between oil changes is not ok!
8694 2018-11-16 19:55:35 Beautiful is right! I just started an oil painting from the sexy pink fog episode - love the pink glow on everything!

8696 2018-11-16 19:55:32 Pipelines are needed for oil exports.
8697 2018-11-16 19:55:21 Think aboot the millions of barrels of oil??? Think aboot the tax on it. Now give your head a wobble.... TAXI FOR SCOTLAND!! INDEPENDENCE NOW!
8698 2018-11-16 19:55:15 It is because it’s the oil that’s closest to the natural sebum our skin produces.

8703 2018-11-16 19:54:34 So why are other countries that rely heavily on oil price not in the same boat? Answer is socialism.
8704 2018-11-16 19:54:25 Tea tree oil is a natural wonder and doesn’t bleach your clothes! And use a light moisturizer 2x a day. Good luck!

8706 2018-11-16 19:54:05 Contrary to popular belief, the world's most valuable resource is not data and oil, it's food and water. If there is a shortage of these two, no amount of data and oil is helpful.
8707 2018-11-16 19:53:56 Yup! Gotta give tha engine oil a chance to circulate through tha engine.
8708 2018-11-16 19:53:53 That oil you are guiding the pipeline is in your land, join Ipob and demand for your freedom, if our freedom is achieved you will get access to the oil not to guide pipeline.
8709 2018-11-16 19:53:49 I hate coming to get my oil change and they try and get me to get all this other junk. Like my dude I need an oil change and that’s it. My car is fine.
8710 2018-11-16 19:53:44 Hey Bill, I have an idea. Build a pipeline to tidewater so that our oil can be sold to nations other than the United States.  It may work.

8714 2018-11-16 19:53:29 What no snake oil
8715 2018-11-16 19:53:18 I've already sorted out Sundays fun. I'm going to steal £406 billion worth of Scottish oil......

8720 2018-11-16 19:52:58 If we’re taking bets, the private prisons, insurance companies, Koch Bros education group, coal lobby, off shore oil, the wall lobby Murdoch, Mercer’s, Adelsohn and the biggest loser the NRA. Things aren’t going exactly as planned so no more support from a few.
8721 2018-11-16 19:52:52 I know Val! I live here... my kids live in Ventura County.. Where I am Val is Agriculture & Oil.. We have the largest fully developed Oil Field in the Country..Conservative County hated by Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento.. are we  next or Conservative Orange County..

8723 2018-11-16 19:52:41 Yes we can sit and talk. Just for the record lad bottom right is me just shows what raw egg and sherry cod liver oil and eating your greens can do. Yes I did say raw egg and sherry 
8724 2018-11-16 19:52:37 I keep hearing IDIOTS shoutin but it’s no your gas n oil..... IN AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND?? The revenue is ours you fucking idiots.
8725 2018-11-16 19:52:36 So no palm oil then. Not exactly major contributors by buying the waste product.  Don't think you can blame alcaholism on the scouts collecting empty bottles.
8726 2018-11-16 19:52:33 Arrest the employers. Arrest the share holders. If General Mills or Shell Oil hires illegals simply arrest the share holders. That would be really great in my mind. These investors know they are dealing with corps what break the laws but feel protected from prosecution.
8727 2018-11-16 19:52:28 God bless the dining car, where the oil is still hot and the schnitzl frying soundly.

8729 2018-11-16 19:52:26 FDA could make Amarin do a short-term mineral oil study. A competitor could do it, too. Just have to show whether or not there is an LDL effect.

8731 2018-11-16 19:52:08 Problem is. If you scrap first you might be loosing ability to build something. e.g. scarp oil and then try to build something requiring it.
8732 2018-11-16 19:52:06 You see how those green cars look we want green cars that look like the gas operated cars. If I was the oil companies I would let the automakers make those green cars because they are like the ugly duckling eventually they won't sell and they will kill themselves
8733 2018-11-16 19:51:59 Sometime you be bussing such a sweet whine in a Fete and you just gotta take it slow ....I just be like “damn why lord bless me with this oil in my waist so ?” CAWBLEEN

8738 2018-11-16 19:51:29 I can’t argue the science because I am not a scientist. A lot of scientists seem pretty convinced, including about how humans are contributing. If it’s all part of a huge conspiracy, to what end exactly? I for one think we should keep developing the oil sands and selling the oil.
8739 2018-11-16 19:51:23 Ill be making homemade Sugar cookies!! Instead of using regular sugar we are replacing it with splenda for a better option then such a sweeter one we were using!

8740 2018-11-16 19:51:16 Jojoba or coconut oil to the rescue
8741 2018-11-16 19:51:15 The progressives, at least where I am, are staunchly against gentrification, and the progressive pol is calling for it. I guess it’s a case of “it’s ok when we do it”?
8742 2018-11-16 19:51:10 Clinique Redness solutions ! Really good cream don’t smell as luxurious as Elemis though but does calm it for me/ I use a rosehip night time oil too from organix form booties I love it only £7 ish for 20ml that seams to help with the clown cheeks
8743 2018-11-16 19:51:07 @WendyWilliams  Coconut Oil is known to restore thyroid function.  So with more definite research you might want a show dedicated to the benefits of coconut oil including brain & spine cancer benefit, diabetes blood sugar level balance :

8745 2018-11-16 19:50:59 I doubt manipulation. As funds have been liquidating their positions on this oil selloff, the gas producers who are also part of these funds are getting dragged with them.
8746 2018-11-16 19:50:48 one good thing about houghton is when i get my oil changed they don’t treat me like a dumbass and it takes them 10 minutes to do
8747 2018-11-16 19:50:47 9/In short, the 20k email drop was not a sudden random event. It was a response, in kind, by the Russians (via Assange/Wikileaks) to Trump's public platform change about Ukraine, at the RNC. 
There's also implications about oil & Rosenft, sanctions & $$$ payouts to Team Trump.
8748 2018-11-16 19:50:42 They had good ones! Teganites, transliterated tiganites these days. And little fritters made from flour and honey and fried in olive oil, then rolled in sesame seeds! WHY WERE THEY WASTING HONEY ON OLIVES

8765 2018-11-16 19:48:50 Please grow, Alberta Party, we need radically expanded discussion on issues. Majority power by any party becomes a monoculture "Big Oil Party". Liberals r totally off radar. UCP are "Koch Bros. Marketing Dept." NDP are stuck with it. No helpful opposition so far.
8766 2018-11-16 19:48:35 Most of those decisions about the rigs are made a while ago. That is the reason why we see a lag of around 3 months between the oil prices and the rig counts. DUCs are already at extreme levels. The rig counts in Permian during the first 3 months of 2019 will be a decisive factor
8767 2018-11-16 19:48:26 Steamed ground groundnuts, 'washed' bitterleaf, onions, ginger, garlic, pepper, white pepper(optional), dried crayfish, meat/fish/seafood of your choice, vegetable oil, salt, seasoning cubes.
8768 2018-11-16 19:48:09 I love to watch young, naive democratic socialists embrace Socialism as the best model for America, even though it has never worked ever in any country..not one.  Best current example is Venezuela, with the worlds largest oil reserves, and they cant even feed their people.
8769 2018-11-16 19:47:58 I don’t know what sealioning is. I don’t think she is a hypocrite. I think she is being transparent. Anyway, we don’t agree about Vivian Krause.That’s fine. What should we be doing to move our oil? Instead of fighting each other, let’s come up with some solutions. I’m serious
8770 2018-11-16 19:47:53 Yea, that's about all we can do.We never did get our free barrel of oil for Big Daddy Bush's war on Iraq saving the Saudi's kingdom..Gotta be nice, so we don't wanta lose the military base-- We do still pay them for protecting their kingdom.. don't we?.

8779 2018-11-16 19:47:19 Energy easy might be a have been good idea. $12 a barrel Alberta oil. Not good for Canada. @JustinTrudeau has no clue. @Bombardier will get a bail out tho. #Again #BoardOfDirectors @ezralevant @SpencerFernando

8805 2018-11-16 19:44:18 The major reason gasoline is cheaper is because of low oil prices. The reason oil prices are low is because of the a-holes in BC, Ontario, and Quebec won't allow pipelines. Maybe you should send some transfer payments our way to compensate us for providing your cheap gas.

8812 2018-11-16 19:43:49 A person could be completely naked, covered in oil, walking toward someone with a ‘lustful’ look in their eye...and unless the nude one gave explicit consent...it would still be rape/assault to touch them.

Being attractive or sexy is not a crime. Nor an excuse for anyone to rape
8813 2018-11-16 19:43:42 It’s the Economy Mr. LaLa Land it’s OIL! Trudeau has no intention to build the pipeline.
8814 2018-11-16 19:43:38 Rachel Notley could personally lay oil pipe to the coast and conservatives in Alberta would still claim she's trying to destroy our energy industry.
8815 2018-11-16 19:43:31 @piersmorgan your Vegan bashing re. soya consumption was so unfair. Only 6% of soybeans grown worldwide are turned directly into food for human consumption. The rest enter the food chain indirectly as farmed animal feed (approx 75%) or for veg oil/biodiesel.. for meat eaters too!

8820 2018-11-16 19:42:53 "Belief." No, climate scientists are  not"paid to propagate the lie." We are certain tho that Kenny, Scheer, Harper & their lackey boys ARE paid to push the interests of fossil fuels on for their petrocrat masters. No one is talking about eliminating oil and gas overnight!
8821 2018-11-16 19:42:47 ما دليلك يا دكتور؟
8822 2018-11-16 19:42:46 Excellent.  Keep the oil flowing!  MAGA!
8823 2018-11-16 19:42:42 That is precisely what I think and where I would place my bet, but we will never know, because who is going to run a comprehensive study on Mineral Oil and to what end?  Pooperefic!
8824 2018-11-16 19:41:49 I’ve discovered that, if I roast it with smashed garlic, S&P, & olive oil, and then sprinkle it w/lemon juice & parmesan, I will eat an entire head of broccoli.
8825 2018-11-16 19:41:38 I’m from Somalia. We don’t need American help. You are just meddling in our problems for our oil. You blend in other nations problems just for oil. Somalia was a powerful nation way before They established relations with USA. You can stop meddling in other nations business.
8826 2018-11-16 19:41:17 3/3 At same forestry conference the big business green groups promoting sustainable palm oil production for bio fuels. I was also a lone voice speaking out against bio fuels.
8827 2018-11-16 19:41:07 كل الدول، الصديقة قبل التي بينها عداوة، تتجسس على بعضها. ده أمر معروف ومتعارف عليه كمان.
8828 2018-11-16 19:41:01 I have mainly oily skin, with some occasional dryness from psoriasis. It helps so much with oil control and acne scars. I combine it with the Galore’s Garden serum for the ultimate combo!
8829 2018-11-16 19:40:51 If content is crude, what's the oil?

8831 2018-11-16 19:40:47 There's a patch of oil on the A916 between Craigrothie & Leven at the Cults junction due to an earlier accident. We're in attendance & the Council have been contacted to clear the road. Please drive safe and slow down at this point. #OpParamount

8833 2018-11-16 19:40:22 My dad sent me cannabis products from his company to try and one of them was sensual oil... lol
8834 2018-11-16 19:40:15 Thought my car needed an oil change... This bitch needs a new belt, something that starts with a T, and has a broken bolt... whereeeeee is my step daddddd I don’t deal with this shit
8835 2018-11-16 19:40:07 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
8836 2018-11-16 19:40:04 I guess this is for your followers that are too stupid to understand how the oil markets work? I guess that'd be pretty much all of them.
8837 2018-11-16 19:40:01 I'll FF through prager's rightwing bullshit. Just don't have the corporate oil shill on like you did a couple years ago.
8838 2018-11-16 19:39:56 Never believed in oils.... now i do!!!!! 
I’m gonna be a oil  soon
8839 2018-11-16 19:39:55 I always say "I don't want a job unless it's in the UN". I'm adding this oil company to the list. 

From my heart to God's ears.
8840 2018-11-16 19:39:44 Gas prices going down now have nothing to do with you.  Don’t mislead so consistently. World oil prices aren’t in your control.

8844 2018-11-16 19:39:07 I think I have a sinus infection  if steaming, paracetamol, hot flannels on my face and olbus oil don’t do the trick by the morning then tomorrow will be spent attempting to get antibiotics (this is after the school Xmas fair of course)! Now to decide on what to order for tea
8845 2018-11-16 19:39:01 A few more boilers been going in this week. Ripped out an old oil boiler as well today ready to fit Monday.
8846 2018-11-16 19:39:00 In addition to which we used the North Sea oil profits to cut taxes for the wealthy. The Scandinavian nations however invested theirs into the countries social systems and they have such a great quality iof life.
8847 2018-11-16 19:38:53 I agree that her age should not be the deciding factor. We should look instead at what she votes for and against? Why is she against a Green New Deal? Oil company money maybe? Why does she want to scrap Medicare For All? Did she vote yes to billionaire tax cuts? @TYTNetwork

8854 2018-11-16 19:38:20 You don’t get to cut a pipeline to the east so CDN. across Canada used our oil instead of Saudi Arabia & undemocratic countries, which hurts Albertans & then pretend to care.  You also don’t continue to collect overtaxed natural gas, but complain about auto emissions.
8855 2018-11-16 19:38:18 are you eating the apples with olive oil? i think gin might form a better combo.
8856 2018-11-16 19:38:09 @NutellaGlobal @NutellaUSA do you use sustainable palm oil? If so, how can you reassure me of this? If not, why not?

8859 2018-11-16 19:37:43 Dude, the price of oil has been declining since Oct and just took haymaker this week. Come on, let's give a better example.
8860 2018-11-16 19:37:43 Slick as oil
8861 2018-11-16 19:37:41 doTERRA people be like: skip the $2 cleaner full of *cHeMiCaLs* and buy this $38 tincture of snake..I mean essential oil to do the same thing but not as good.
8862 2018-11-16 19:37:38 Smart school buses can help a whole lot but in New York, taxpayers always complain about how much it will cost them but they don't complain about how much the Pentagon is spending in the war just so big oil industry can make a huge profit
8863 2018-11-16 19:37:24  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON AUTO REPAIR, BRAKES, OIL CHANGES, OR ANY OTHER CONCERN ABOUT YOUR CAR, DM ME! 
8864 2018-11-16 19:37:19 Okay,that’s what I thought you were going to show me. She doesn’t hide that info. Thank you for providing it.Have you ever heard her speak? Why fight someone who is trying to help?Also she is courageous because she has been doing majority of the heavy lifting regarding oil issues
8865 2018-11-16 19:37:05 I advocate tax restructure so that the 1% and corporations —despite their ability to painlessly do so—no longer pay proportionally less tax than the lower and middle classes. Are YOU okay shouldering the tax burden of Big Oil and Big Pharma? Because you ARE.
8866 2018-11-16 19:36:53 doug ford isn’t actually taking credit for the change to winter gas, and the drop in oil price per barrel  ?!!

4¢ is all.

8868 2018-11-16 19:36:45 It's like asking an oil executive to accept the worst predictions about climate change. They just can't do it. Humans are not after all logical.
8869 2018-11-16 19:36:40 Has to be oil.
8870 2018-11-16 19:36:25 Orientalism on oil :)
8871 2018-11-16 19:36:10 My Car Feels Sooo Good After A Oil Change 
8872 2018-11-16 19:36:09 all I remember about my dream last night is someone said "hey wizard, go huff your palm oil" which would have been weird and funny enough on its own, except they stuttered and actually said "palm yolo", and everyone else went wild laughing like "DID YOU JUST SAY PALM YOLO?"
8873 2018-11-16 19:36:08 My skin is (as) clear (as it ever gets), got an oil change, got a car wash and vacuum, got @mitskileaks Be the Cowboy on vinyl, closing on a house next week: I can do this!

8876 2018-11-16 19:35:53 get it off of amazon you freak, just make sure it’s 100% organic rose hip oil
8877 2018-11-16 19:35:19 I suspect St. Lawrence water is cheaper than oil right now as @cathmckenna supports using it as an open sewer
8878 2018-11-16 19:35:16 Women be swearing gas and oil is all a car need to functionally operate 
8879 2018-11-16 19:35:14 Thank you so much for drawing attention to this. Corruption of politics, government and media with oil money is a huge threat to our lives and futures.
8880 2018-11-16 19:35:14 And I came here today fr a friends daughter funeral aftr jumah .
May Allah be pleased with his soul.
8881 2018-11-16 19:34:54 Ask the same people who want to phase out the oil sands and other oil and gas development in Canada if they’d likewise shut down auto manufacturing and bombardier in the east. #cdnpoli
8882 2018-11-16 19:34:52 This is a great link, to help people understand the need for oil is still great.
8883 2018-11-16 19:34:35 I’m watching @TheMAURYShow while getting an oil change and this lady just said that Mexicans are the same as native Americans and I don’t think I can handle the stupidity anymore
8884 2018-11-16 19:34:34 it's neither right nor wrong it "just is ", strategic and tactical advantage exist everywhere on both sides , IMO opinion it has as much to do with the China /Trade war as it does Iran .cjina now has to bleed USD reserves to buy oil
8885 2018-11-16 19:34:09 Likewise, for c40yrs in one capacity or another. I served to defend my country and if that also meant Europe (which it largely did) that's fine. As for the EU flag, a useful rag for checking oil levels, absolutely no allegiance to it whatsoever.
8886 2018-11-16 19:34:09 How much oil do we need, the markets are overflowing with it
8887 2018-11-16 19:34:04 OG - unless you specifically have a name, it’s not fair on anyone you talking this cryptic...did you not leave the group? so you saying you were kicked out?
8888 2018-11-16 19:33:58 Stop sharing “don’t support palm oil” posts if you are not planning on boycotting palm oil!
8889 2018-11-16 19:33:52 Beyond that we would stop supporting nations that don’t care about democratic or human rights.  Also allow us to export to Europe so Russian oil consumption is reduced or levelled off.  That would reduce Putin’s revenue.
8890 2018-11-16 19:33:46 Can’t wait to break bread and olive oil with you. I’ll be in touch xx
8891 2018-11-16 19:33:39 @jeffersondsmith poor Natalie BOT. 
Not "woke" enough to know that if WE don't keep Nancy Pelosi right now, WE WON'T gain the people who will help us w #climatechange. 
So what if she's a "billionaire?" which I doubt,  it's what greedy OIL billionaires are doing to OUR planet!

8894 2018-11-16 19:33:21 I think his wizard stage was when he was still trying to ignore his responsibilities and the 4 maidens helped him see the Bueaty in life again so he granted them some of his magic, that's just my theory though
8895 2018-11-16 19:33:18 Brand new oil change. Pumped the tires up. Clean af car wash. All ready and done for this weekend and for a river trip next week 
8896 2018-11-16 19:33:11 Wow did i just find my new favorite hair oil
8897 2018-11-16 19:33:09 Great questions.  Many of the patients probably have never ingested mineral oil before and def not on a daily basis, so who knows how that affected their digestive system.  It may take a while to adjust and once the system adjusted we saw that the ldl levels stabilized.
8898 2018-11-16 19:33:07 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
8899 2018-11-16 19:33:05 Not disagreeing with that. Cons are complaining that Canada is buying Saudi oil, in reality, it's a private company.
8900 2018-11-16 19:33:01 Dude .. the drop in gas prices is due to the 25% drip in crude oil prices the last three months. The energy sector has taken a beating.  Stop lying.
8901 2018-11-16 19:32:58 He takes $ from big oil.
8902 2018-11-16 19:32:46 I don’t that one is saved. I ain’t going back no mo. They need a lil more anointing oil

8904 2018-11-16 19:32:26 U are brown girl use that coconut oil
8905 2018-11-16 19:32:19 Not when it’s the only viable industry & the price tanks. They import EVERYTHING, from food to medicine, they produce very little besides oil. It’s analogous to what I saw when I lived in Hawaii during the 1st Gulf War. Tourism tanked & the state went into crisis.
8906 2018-11-16 19:32:09 Totally appreciate Turkey for following the rabbit hole on this one, but also wondering where they get their oil from #brassballs
8907 2018-11-16 19:32:01 Took way too much cbd oil by accident last night AND this morning so I’ve been a high zombie for like 18 hours now. Oops

8909 2018-11-16 19:31:39 it was the vegetable oil for me - never thought of that one to cook food with! Obvious I suppose.
8910 2018-11-16 19:31:37 I hate getting my oil changed. I always end up needing other stuff done and have to spend way more than expected. I just hate cars. Lord, give me my wings here on earth.
8911 2018-11-16 19:31:31 Diffusing this tea trea oil hella shifted my energy.
8912 2018-11-16 19:31:31 Obviously music and media topics could be woven in there. And of course Will has an inside look at public eduction in one of the most austerity riddled states. Also the absurdity of oil and gas money dominance of politics and other things people in other regions may be unaware of
8913 2018-11-16 19:31:22 Se ganó confianza, tranquilidad y se bajo d las nubes a Perú q se creía la mejor selección después d Brasil
8914 2018-11-16 19:31:20 The $6 Trillion should have been spent getting us off of oil. There would have been no reason for oil wars, cleaner air, and a huge advance against climate change.
8915 2018-11-16 19:31:18 2/x Point made with a photo of a rain forest, a photo of palm oil plantation. Palm oil plantation looks like a Forestry Commission plantation 30 years ago Serried rows of trees, nothing else. Monoculture.
8916 2018-11-16 19:31:12 Yes, when I was sitting next to my 'lil old oil field in my garden and eating my Chelow Kababs. 
8917 2018-11-16 19:31:11 just blended 100mg of rick simpson oil into my morning smoothie - for science
8918 2018-11-16 19:30:34 Y'all gonna make a sweet potato castor oil on Thanksgiving?
8919 2018-11-16 19:30:30  Thank you! I will try it next time. Sometimes I use oil to break the adhesive but I just tried with water.
8920 2018-11-16 19:30:13 They're still trying to push that label. The way white supremacist groups have attempted to demonize antifascists reminds me so much of when the same strategy was used by the oil & gas industry to label environmentalists as "eco-terrorists", Projection!
8921 2018-11-16 19:30:13 Update last night at our Texas Revile we had more than 300 people come out. What a blessing. We prayed & Layed Hands on many also Anointing them with oil. We saw many people get saved . Our local Church's will follow up with them all. Amen We will starting back home in A.M.
8922 2018-11-16 19:30:03 That’s insane for an oil change...

8925 2018-11-16 19:29:33 Norway produces more oil. 

Which income is missing? 

Have you told Scot govt?
8926 2018-11-16 19:29:30 Jarod and I had a car appointment for our recall and they fixed it for free, then Jarod asked them if they could do an oil change too and they did and they billed us €112! Lol
8927 2018-11-16 19:29:17 Sorry, won’t be buying until you are palm oil free. Other manufacturers make lovely chocolate that doesn’t destroy orangutans #boycottCadbury
8928 2018-11-16 19:29:13 1/x Several years ago, I was at a forestry conference, a lone voice saying sustainable palm oil production an oxymoron.
8929 2018-11-16 19:29:06 You're assuming the only adverse effect of the mineral oil was the increase in non-HDL-C.
8930 2018-11-16 19:28:58 Thank you again for sharing valuable content. The oil market has been one of the best commodity market to trade lately
8931 2018-11-16 19:28:50 The Democrats would have assualted any Republican President regardless who it is.   They told George W wanted to keep arsenic in our drinking water and wanted to go to war for oil.    Never forget, the left hates anyone who disagrees with them
8932 2018-11-16 19:28:45 This is a frameworthy picture 
8933 2018-11-16 19:28:42 before the excess inventory in the oil market forced the price down to $27 per barrel in February 2016.

WTI also reached a peak of $105 per barrel in June 2014 before the sharp drop in oil prices.)
8934 2018-11-16 19:28:41 Vitamin E oil!

8937 2018-11-16 19:28:24 Isai 61:3 
to provide for those who grieve in Zion to give them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and a garment of praise in place of a spirit of despair. So they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of The Most High that He may be glorified.
8938 2018-11-16 19:28:14 Is it me or have fuel prices been slowly creeping up? Diesel at a local place is 10p a litre more expensive too!!! I swear there were protests last time it was touching nearly £1.40 a litre?!? #fuelprice #Shell #stealthtax #Oil
8939 2018-11-16 19:28:13 Economic cost of Canadian oil price discounts counted in billions of dollars
8940 2018-11-16 19:28:11 At the inauguration, @GovernorIkpeazu anchored his developmental agenda on the 5 pillars of agriculture, education, infrastructure, trade, and commerce as well as oil and gas. #MyIkpeazuSuccessStory
8941 2018-11-16 19:27:52 Sure. Why on earth would oil prices have an effect on the economy of the world's 4th largest oil producer and it's nationalised source of income? No effect at all. None.
8942 2018-11-16 19:27:44 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
8943 2018-11-16 19:27:00 I wil not follow ur writing page. Just find a smal calabash, 7 white pap, 7 eggs, white feathers, live Cockriel, with a lot of palm oil on top, then take it to ikeja along by 12am. Don't talk to anybody till you go and come back. Cos ur village ppl hav final opened ur case file.

8945 2018-11-16 19:26:46 Semi sweet chocolate chips
8946 2018-11-16 19:26:42 I know you probably meant this as a joke, but a person with the right connections and non-profit know-how could probably swing this. The oil and gas companies that have been in Alaska long-term donate to a lot of community programs.
8947 2018-11-16 19:26:21 I have it on good authority that these undercarriage problems have been  intentionally perpetrated by agents of big oil who have identified Model 3 owners utilizing proprietary technology before deploying teams of highly trained saboteurs. You should be ashamed for spreading FUD!

8949 2018-11-16 19:26:18 Never said anything about developing countries. We have already pinpointed the main drivers which is major oil/energy companies and their practices. Let's start there.
8950 2018-11-16 19:26:05 I’m lucky I have changing the car oil as well. Otherwise I’d be out.

8956 2018-11-16 19:25:06 Ever had that feeling where you feel like you kinda need an oil change? ... nah, me neither.
8957 2018-11-16 19:25:01 Oil dear 
8958 2018-11-16 19:25:00 I love me some coconut oil 
8959 2018-11-16 19:24:59 I do too and my makeup is oil free
8960 2018-11-16 19:24:43 Thanksgiving is next week and I already know my dad is gonna ask if I’ve checked the oil in my car.
8961 2018-11-16 19:24:35 about all you can say is it does perhaps reduce the need to dig up more oil but it does not do anything beyond that & is not a sol'n, it is a way to keep us tethered to a fuel "tank" so they can keep us on that umbilical but the carbon they capture isn't sequestered it's BURNED
8962 2018-11-16 19:24:31 @FairQuestions Danielle Smith @ABDanielleSmith would be a great show to share your important  info on as well. Industry leaders and oil companies might need to think about donating to fighting back. Everyday Albertans would donate more if we could, but they are strapped for cash
8963 2018-11-16 19:24:30 What were they genuinely hoping for?
Any anger should be vented at the charlatans and snake oil salesmen
8964 2018-11-16 19:24:26 I see you Dreger. Trying to score free oil for the @costcocanada. I need wwf, thanks.
8965 2018-11-16 19:24:22 Accept the correction and move ! Why must you lie with the figure if you are genuine.

2016 oil went as low as $45 but it was around $80 with a benchmark of $50 .
In 2014 oil sold at $65 so don't come online and sell lies. This is Twitter not Facebook!
8966 2018-11-16 19:23:51 I’m at the dealership getting my oil changed... y’all this mf in here is so fucking fine  God took his timeeeeeeee!

8968 2018-11-16 19:23:39 Sweet Potatoes are best roasted with a bit of oil and salt, not covered in marshmallows.
8969 2018-11-16 19:23:38 Try to not be a judgemental vegetarian/wannabe vegan, but makes me laugh that everyone is refusing to eat foods that contain palm oil for the good of animals but then eat a steak instead 
8970 2018-11-16 19:23:33 You're sweet. My great aunt's house always smelled like garlic and oregano simmering in olive oil.  I know that smell.  My house smells that way a lot.  I do the cooking.

So, sauce not gravy?
8971 2018-11-16 19:23:23 And using @peta certification to pretend that they care about animals when their unsustainable palm oil use will wipe out species. @rangtanforest
8972 2018-11-16 19:23:22 What the heck kind of massage oil does my favorite massuer use?! Every single time after a session, my hairline is filled with painful acne breakouts?!
8973 2018-11-16 19:23:20 one of the main reasons to not use the funds is the looming oil industry shocks.
Govt can always balance the issue with reducing the taxes.
8974 2018-11-16 19:23:05 Not to be dramatic but I’m pretty sure lavender oil has cured my seasonal depression.
8975 2018-11-16 19:23:04 I've used the Jamaican castor oil line from Shea moisture and I say it has...I had to cut a lot of split ends (my fault), but my hair went from above shoulder length to shoulder blades in months.

8982 2018-11-16 19:22:14 Oh and a quick history lesson. The International community condemned the illegal annexation of the Golan Heights in 1981. What interests Israel and USA in Golan Heights today? Oh yes three little words OIL. This is theft of Syrian resources. Look up Genie Oil.

8993 2018-11-16 19:20:44 DeVos's appointment is inappropriate in the same way as putting coal and oil lobbyists in charge of oversight of environmental policy, Goldman Sachs executives in charge of regulating Wall Street, etc. It's cronyism at least, partisan for sure, and probably dumb in the end

9004 2018-11-16 19:19:10 Golf vs eGolf is about $10K. In 100K of driving at 30 mpg and $3 a gallon that's the price difference. Then add no oil changes, and whatever residual value is added by the electric motor, you come out ahead. Plus far fewer parts to fail.

9011 2018-11-16 19:18:42 its a high risk move as the oil industry is in a turmoil after Iran sanctions and increase in demand in US, and god know the Saudi situation, so reducing reserves now and once oil prices hit $80-100 you wont have any safety net to handle. however judicial use of funds is ok.

9051 2018-11-16 19:14:18 39% of $ppr oil is correlated to WCS due to sales points. Not sure why anyone wants to invest in Canadian Oil? Prices are coming down IMO and Canada is laughing stock of this sector. Only thing saving it now is the Nat gas swing. Careful.

9095 2018-11-16 19:08:43 Since you are against printing, at least can we agree that it makes sense for RBI to release foreign reserves to buy oil and reduce CAD?
9096 2018-11-16 19:08:42 Coconut oil makes everything better.
9097 2018-11-16 19:08:30 Lol you're a damn fool. Giving them fining power would have a terrible ripple effect to other sports, create a worse police state in the NFL, and would create a bond like oil and water between players and officials. You're just a foolish troll, go away.
9098 2018-11-16 19:08:23 Can restaurants start posting what oil or other potential allergens are in their restaurant on their websites please? I'm tired of risking my well being when I'm travelling on the road to find out of a restaurant is safe for me.
9099 2018-11-16 19:08:20 If ur suggested deficit is based on our expenditure then you must build in our total income....you seem unwilling to accept. Norway’s income from oil is much larger from smaller production. Scotland is not receiving ALL income it generates. With unwanted UK  exp. the deficit goes

9103 2018-11-16 19:08:02 Took me a month or two but finally getting my oil changed
9104 2018-11-16 19:07:41 Yes he isn't but he could hv started something for example signing the PIB into law,starting a real restructuring process so as to free the nation from over dependence on oil,but alas he didn't I haven't even seen any meaningful reform his govt has done
9105 2018-11-16 19:07:39 @JustinTrudeau Put Canada to work.  Pipelines.  Please look at this thread. As you buy Saudi oil and leave Alberta land locked the economy takes on a massive blow. We need some leadership.
9106 2018-11-16 19:07:39 Where is the oil??!!
Somebody get the oil!!

9107 2018-11-16 19:07:37 Our military doesn't defend these people, the US defends our  interests around the world! This would include oil, minerals and material not found in US
9108 2018-11-16 19:07:28 To put it another way: when your toilet packs up, your fuse box is blown, your oil filter is blocked and you desperately want that new extension, a degree in journalism or women's studies isn't going to help you
9109 2018-11-16 19:07:28 The hike of interest rate by US federal reserve and crude oil price leads disinvestment in emerging economies, Hence Govt of Nepal should take in confidence of Indian and Chinese investors.
9110 2018-11-16 19:07:26 Stuff your amateur analysis. The wonder is people who can deny science. I'm guessing you're a home-schooled evangelical living in the Alberta sticks whose husband or daddy worked driving an oil truck. Since we're in the very silly guessing game now. Get off your bum & travel.

9120 2018-11-16 19:06:37 What’s intellectually dishonest is pumping taxpayer money into dying industries like oil, gas, and fracking. What’s intellectually dishonest is sending our troops to stop asylum seekers. What’s intellectually dishonest is reserving sterling healthcare for the richest among us.

9128 2018-11-16 19:06:00 I agree. But we do have a case here where the political strength of certain industries may be retarding important technological developments. Historically, the oil industry's attempts to squash the development of the electric car is one example.  Similarly with solar/wind.

9134 2018-11-16 19:05:33 On the topic of socially responsible investing (example = investing in oil vs. sustainable energy): from an investing standpoint sustainable energy companies may not be a good investment (e.g. Tesla) due to their current economics. How do you think about this balance?

9153 2018-11-16 19:03:11 Pre poo is when you apply oil to your hair before shampooing so the cleansing process won’t dry your hair !

9155 2018-11-16 19:03:06 Help what? You are trying to change the world by attacking 0.14% of world emissions in the only jurisdiction with a climate plan and carbon tax. You are allowing Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria etc. to supply oil during the energy transition. Poor choice.
9156 2018-11-16 19:03:00 Question this leads to is will changes be in time to remain competitive (considering emission taxes + decreasing efficiency advantages) for investors looking out 10+ years? 

Seems more like a way to address existing infra probs vs justify new development... Big oil = dinosaur.
9157 2018-11-16 19:02:58 Just took a multivitamin and fish oil with a bottle of Kombucha after eating a donut and salami sammich.

9158 2018-11-16 19:02:36 It will reduce the gap between the Western Cdn Select and West Texas Intermediate. We are only getting $13-15 per barrel. Tough to pay for education, health care and infrastructure worries types of prices  .So yes we need to get our oil to other markets.

9162 2018-11-16 19:02:17 it is kind of fascinating to watch. they really feel there is some sort of exceptionalism that will save the Alberta oil industry despite, you know, facts.

But we live in a global economy and when our trading partners force true carbon taxes GLOBALLY (like $100/Mt) it's over...

9166 2018-11-16 19:01:55 No.  JT killed Northern Gateway, Energy East and is pushing through legislation on a tanker ban, without consulting indigenous peoples, and has little to expedite TMX. Instead we sell our resources cheap, allow unethical oil to replace it on world and east CDN markets.

9174 2018-11-16 19:00:55 Silence is a way to protect. Trudeau is silent about the gap in price of oil between Western Canadian Select, and everyone else, to protect the Americans who don't want pipelines built in Canada; & this is how the #WeaponizedMedia protect Trudeau. Watch out for back-firing.

9187 2018-11-16 18:59:37 Investors see that and until we fix that, we won't be going far with pricing. They see how trade balance went into deficit and reserves slumped with small oil shock. So, we  should focus on Non-oil FDI investments.

9189 2018-11-16 18:59:15 And again the practice of individuals owning oil blocks must be discarded. You don’t see an individual owning oil block in Canada, UK, USA etc. Government should create enabling to attract investors and hands off

9196 2018-11-16 18:58:02 Hi Laura. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.
9197 2018-11-16 18:58:02 Don’t fall for that one.
9198 2018-11-16 18:57:55 I guess the "foodies" haven't picked this up yet, but if you want fluffy white rice, toast it in a bit of oil before adding your water and salt. You'll get more flavor and the texture is perfect every time. You only need to toast until most of your grains turn opaque/light brown.
9199 2018-11-16 18:57:45 This is not the lowest but it's like you want something but you wont pass a threshold because of risk perception. Nigeria has a low debt to  GDP but why can't the rate be favourable? The biggest risk is the volatility of a country to oil price.

9231 2018-11-16 18:54:54 like i’ll buy the oil and the filter, i’m not tryna get somebody to pay for it lol i just want you to do it bc i don’t like to get dirty. 
9232 2018-11-16 18:54:49 i live with three white men and watching them cook chicken, unwashed, slimy, cut up thrown in a lukewarm pan without so much as a sprinkle of seasoning or oil gives me anxiety
9233 2018-11-16 18:54:45 what you are saying is @OfficialAPCNg is incompetent. Even without Oil a competent government would have moved Nigeria forward. Let’s stop all this oil nonsense. How much of today’s infrastructure did oil build. We had Oil Palm, Cocoa, etc. Israel was built on its human resource
9234 2018-11-16 18:54:34 youre right!! its closest to our natural oil/sebum so our skin reacts to it extremely well!
9235 2018-11-16 18:54:16 Do it! :D I use a depositing conditioner (Argon Oil color conditioner) because red and orange dyes just don’t last very long, anyway, so might as well not fry my hair.
9236 2018-11-16 18:54:13 Any information. Any questions raised. Any light is important to the palm oil issue, and others. It worked well with fur, and smoking. Well done Iceland. Does it advertise you? So what if it does.
9237 2018-11-16 18:53:59 I’m having so many issues with this cold weather and my makeup. 
Set foundation= Sahara Desert/cake factory by the end of the day 
Don’t set foundation= you were wearing foundation? Looks like you bathed in olive oil
9238 2018-11-16 18:53:56 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
9239 2018-11-16 18:53:46 This Cantu argon oil leave in conditioner is... the truth. Where have I been?
9240 2018-11-16 18:53:30 No gumption Gove. The most vile self-serving political snake oil salesman in the whole of British politics.
9241 2018-11-16 18:53:29 my hair doesn’t like expensive products. It like coconut oil and $9 conditioner  Thank God
9242 2018-11-16 18:53:18 @Hasbro let's talk about your crap products...namely the #NERF #Hulk Assembler Gear.

I've bought this collection of gren processed oil twice.  It's been defective both times.

#Hasbro makes kids cry.
9243 2018-11-16 18:52:30 1. I think I agreed with privatizing NNPC. NNPC is nothing but a corruption haven. Do you think if our oil sector is in private hands Dieziani Madueke, Andrew Yakubu and cohorts will see billions to steal? I live in the West in a country that’s one of the largest oil producers
9244 2018-11-16 18:52:29 I wonder if because my prices are so low people don't want to buy from me. The higher the price usually means better quality.. Hmmm..
9245 2018-11-16 18:52:10 #carbureuntitre Gas oil, Pétrole..pétrole, (ah, zut, ça existe déjà !)
9246 2018-11-16 18:52:08 Well @OldSpice you did it. I want your beard oil.
9247 2018-11-16 18:51:48 yeah oil! Let’s cover our children and the insides of their mouths in this miracle oil!
9248 2018-11-16 18:51:42 Jamaica Black Castor Oil
9249 2018-11-16 18:51:41 If you ever want to get me a small gift, oil brushes and embroidery needles are somehow always needed plus bathbomb or bubblebars are always appreciated
9250 2018-11-16 18:51:39 No gumption Gove. The most vile self-serving political snake oil salesman in the whole of British politics.
9251 2018-11-16 18:51:39 But what currency will we use ? our oil is worthless and we’re not genetically programmed to make decisions
9252 2018-11-16 18:51:38 Man City's front 3 had they no Oil money
9253 2018-11-16 18:51:24 So about avocado oil. I bought mine from Aldi's for $5.98, which is about what you'd pay for their organic olive oill.
9254 2018-11-16 18:51:17 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
9255 2018-11-16 18:51:10 لانستخدم سمسم مستورد يمني او حبشي او سمسم تعرض لمبيدات ، نستخدم سمسم بادي مزرع طبيعيا بدون سماد كيميائي وبدون مبيدات .. حتى ننتج زيت سمسم فاخر عالي الجودة ( ينافسونا في السعر ولا احد ينافسنا في الجودة ) 
نشتري السمسم بسعر مرتفع ونعصره عصرة أولى عالبارد فقط .. اتوقع سعرنا عادل جدا
9256 2018-11-16 18:51:08 Went to fill up my car, get an oil change, wash it, then treat myself to smoothie king bc I’m being productive.
9257 2018-11-16 18:51:04 Not only do pig mats keep oil from getting onto my desk at work, my coworkers and I use them as plates when we order pizza 
9258 2018-11-16 18:51:01 I FOLLOWED THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND FILLED MY RESERVOIR WITH COOKING OIL AND NOW MY CAR LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE HOT RODS WITH FLAMES COMING OUT THE SIDES
9259 2018-11-16 18:50:57 How’s the oil money?
9260 2018-11-16 18:50:52 Outrage probably funded by the Kerry-Heinz family.  Ketchup is pure sugar.  Iranian oil isn't enough.
9261 2018-11-16 18:50:45 Our president isn’t a judge. Be like getting mad at Whole Foods because they won’t give you an oil change.
9262 2018-11-16 18:50:40 I said hello to a guy riding a cart at night.

He said something mean back.

I didn't shoot him, but I did shoot his oil lamp. #Flammables

9266 2018-11-16 18:50:02 I needed an oil change 6000 miles ago 
9267 2018-11-16 18:49:56 wait wasn't that their point tho that people are only caring about palm oil when they should be caring about animal agriculture as well
9268 2018-11-16 18:49:42 Why don't you say it's sustainable palm oil on the packaging? Sensible thing to do. Glad you are taking a responsible approach. Thanks
9269 2018-11-16 18:49:31 a quadrillion is 15 zeros. So 550,000,000,000,000,000/210,000,000 or a ratio 2,619,047,619.05 gallons of saltwater to one of oil.

That's my logic, and for oysters, I'm sticking to it.
9270 2018-11-16 18:49:29 renewable energies this year have become cheaper than oil and coal and most of asia is switching over faster than anyone expected

the ocean cleanup project is ahead of schedule clearing plastic from the ocean

polar bears and fin whales are no longer endangered
9271 2018-11-16 18:49:28 Finesse them and get your oil changed for free
9272 2018-11-16 18:49:24 I would like to see oil price below $10. That's happen back in 1998. Massive shutdown of entire Oil sands. People will go on the streets. End of Liberal/NDP era.
9273 2018-11-16 18:49:05 Canada produces 5% of the global oil while the US produces 14% and we get a failing grade?  Something is off about this "study"
9274 2018-11-16 18:49:04 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
9275 2018-11-16 18:49:02 Im not worrying, Chowkidaar and his chamchaas are worrying abt Raefel deal, Demon Scam, Essar oil scam, Education cess scam, rapes, murders...etc...
9276 2018-11-16 18:48:56 The family you have as e.g. was that of a former head of state..it open secret that when it comes to being rich by attachment to govt(whether by embezzlement or oil well) the northerners are more.igbo also have those types..now compare those types outside  govt and purely private
9277 2018-11-16 18:48:53 Im trying to make oil pulling a habit but putting a heap of oil into my mouth makes me gag
9278 2018-11-16 18:48:49 The History of the Standard Oil Company (1904) is now officially out! #stoked #money #writing #history
9279 2018-11-16 18:48:45 so basically they have no plan for the falling price of Canadian oil
9280 2018-11-16 18:48:43 Liverpool are cursed to have their best manager and squad in decades at the same time Pep decided to go balls deep in the Premier League with all the oil money he could ever want or need.  We may get 95 points and lose the league. Cursed.
9281 2018-11-16 18:48:35 I know the narative: Ignore dairy industry linked paper showing health benefits of butter. Instead, combine studies sponsored by statin manufacturer, with studies sponsored by a food companies that sells seed oil based products to induce that butter is harmful.

9287 2018-11-16 18:48:04 Today I've got a haircut, oil change, been to the optometrist, and got my car washed. This the most productive off day I've had in a while
9288 2018-11-16 18:47:47 @sainsburys That doesn't really help as you haven't answered the question! I'd like to know if the balm in your ultrabalm tissues contains #PalmOil or palm oil derivatives eg palmitate, tocopherol

9294 2018-11-16 18:47:07 It’s not a gas or oil farm is it?
9295 2018-11-16 18:47:06 Cuz what is the point? To them oil down is one thing, and to us it's something else. I never see so many supposedly smart people act so dumb before smh. Replying to this is dumb. Leave them in their ignorance.
9296 2018-11-16 18:46:59 I’ve never understood why getting a oil change took so long ... 
9297 2018-11-16 18:46:42 I prefer it. 70 is my sweet spot but depends on maker. Advantage of dark, less to no palm oil.
9298 2018-11-16 18:46:08 Oga wai mene ya hadaka fada da hula ne..?
9299 2018-11-16 18:46:03 It sucks but Big Oil has got money to make.
9300 2018-11-16 18:45:45 If you truly ARE Iranian, then you need to get real.  The ONLY thing Trump wants from you is your OIL.  You poor people could be slaves FOREVER and it would bother him not a bit.  Open your eyes.

9302 2018-11-16 18:45:42 Bloomberg Economics says #Russia economy is 10% smaller than would have been predicted in 2013. While slower than expected growth due in part to price of oil, Bloomberg says bigger factor is impact of Western sanctions.
9303 2018-11-16 18:45:42 What is it that Bombardier has on the Quebec Liberal brotherhood ?

9306 2018-11-16 18:45:29 I always forget that when you pull into an "instant" oil change garage, there's the chance that your soul will wither as you accidentally resign yourself to be waiting in a parking lot with no exits for the next hour or two.
9307 2018-11-16 18:45:26 Throw down some Wesson oil on a Twister mat and you’ve got yourself a screaming Friday night

9317 2018-11-16 18:44:13 私アロマテラピー好きで、さすがに経口利用したことはないのですが、ものによってorganic essential oil, food grade qualityって書いてあるのがありますが、そういうのもダメなのかしら。オーガニック部分はともかく、正直どうやって作ってるか分からないですしね。

9319 2018-11-16 18:43:26 Lawd....i log into my outlet of foolishness, aka, twitter and see that Lola’s baby girl (@IRLinMedia) has followed me. All of my timeline needs to be blessed with oil cause I cut up on twitter. I hope she ain’t scanning, LOL! 
9320 2018-11-16 18:43:25 I have a nightly skin care routine and use and essential oil diffuser. Am I an adult now?
9321 2018-11-16 18:43:10 You needn't have bothered to reply at all, I'm certainly not dying to hear from you. How much more education should someone with 5 degrees obtain in order to understand the petty grasping of the oil guzzlers?
9322 2018-11-16 18:43:09 Only continuous part that is crit, Fire (for combo with Oil) is auto. Also, there are plenty of damage buffs in faction to turn their damage up considerably. Say Syvestro with one Retaliator, makes it threat longer with it’s spray and the max output of the CGI is amazing
9323 2018-11-16 18:43:01 If he and the Republican Party would support Green Energy initiatives and getting dependency on oil reduced then we could tell the Saudi's we don't need them until they change.  Until then we will continue to look the other way as we have always done.

9326 2018-11-16 18:42:56 considering the destruction that palm oil has already caused, nestle should reinvest in projects to replant and sustain the environment
9327 2018-11-16 18:42:54 That moment when you're so baked, you don't put as much oil in the pan, so then afterwards, you're left cleaning the fucking thing for like 15 mins... #FML

9332 2018-11-16 18:41:48 Did not you see that what the US did to Syria was the same thing they tried to do in Turkey? Have you forgotten who is behind the attempted coup in Turkey? That it's all just a US move to get Syrian oil.

9338 2018-11-16 18:40:54 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9345 2018-11-16 18:40:10 You said you don't disagree and my point here is that the SE shd hold their leaders responsible for the ecological and infrastructural issues they have. There was nothing wrong in having a rail line for the East during years of oil boom with the principal officials they had

9354 2018-11-16 18:38:29 Actions speak louder than words . Was a governor not given a Jubilee ticket to vie with NYS loot.  Or was that the movie NYS season 1. And we have season 2 while we wait for season 3?? Oil export funds are in which account in CBK ??
9355 2018-11-16 18:38:28 Ah, apologies. In that case mustard seed oil wouldn't be much of a help.

9369 2018-11-16 18:36:46 LOL. They don't control oil prices and they can't magically get pipelines built today. They did improve the royalty regime right out of the gate.
9370 2018-11-16 18:36:34 Hey CBD Oil - K Guzman(@CbdYour), thank you for following me
9371 2018-11-16 18:35:59 Parece a propósito cada vez q vengo yo mi viejo manija de gas oil se queda naaa q asco me da 
9372 2018-11-16 18:35:58 Bio oil so I’ve heard I have them everywhere it’s human nature boo  embrace!!!!
9373 2018-11-16 18:35:36 Just stop your colour is black(oil/war£€$)
9374 2018-11-16 18:35:33 I just had a quest at Thousand needles:
Go help a negotiator to buy oil from locals.
Rivals offer way more gold than your side.
Get fools gold to offer to the locals.
Locals get mad, kill locals and just start pumping oil.
Also kinda kill their Guardian Spirit
9375 2018-11-16 18:35:29 So to my girls with nipple piercings and do daily sea salt soaks, what do you do for dryness? I've heard emu oil is good, but I wanted some suggestions (pls help winter sucks)
9376 2018-11-16 18:35:21 #f2b I ran a reverse image search on this image which is being circulated as proof of DEWs being used in CA. Three divergent explanations came up. Some say it was a meteorite hit, others say DEWs. Snopes has a photo of this indicating it's a controlled burn at an oil refinary.
9377 2018-11-16 18:35:19 Bursaries to 10 oil rich districts? Not serious! This oil belongs to Ugandans. Even without oil, the UPC Government provided bursaries to all secondary students. Beneficiaries were Museveni, Rugunda, Muntu, myself. Let us do the same and educate Ugandans. Outcome will help all.
9378 2018-11-16 18:35:10 Strong oil n weak rupee
9379 2018-11-16 18:34:58 fiendishly clever, with emphasis on the fiend
the only reason for secrecy is national security, you have to question whose national security Westminster had in mind when in marked the #McCroneReport Top Secret and hid it in the vaults

where's our oil fund

9380 2018-11-16 18:34:58 Hope oil ano
9381 2018-11-16 18:34:57 May the post-Brexit shortage of oil mean one cannot both warm the mansion and roast the hog: causing one to chose btwn heat or eat.

9382 2018-11-16 18:34:55 Oil change on Monday
9383 2018-11-16 18:34:55 Lool issa joke. Basically some Trini posted “oil down” which wasn’t oil down  and when Grenadians were saying that’s not it some members from Trini twitter tried to argue with them. It’s our national dish we should know what is and isn’t oil down.
9384 2018-11-16 18:34:53 I want to try it again it’s been so long! have you ever used avocado oil?
9385 2018-11-16 18:34:51 @FairQuestions has many answers for Alberta’s oil & gas sector

9387 2018-11-16 18:34:46 $SPY oil said nope
9388 2018-11-16 18:34:46 Baby oil, olive oil or crude?
9389 2018-11-16 18:34:37 How about grape seed oil?
9390 2018-11-16 18:34:35 Good to know. I've recently found out the hard way coconut oil and Shea butter give me pimples
9391 2018-11-16 18:34:33 OPEX is hard to comment on since it’s hard to find a benchmark for such a unique pipeline project (heated pipeline for Ugandan oil API levels) lakini kama kweli 85% is to be spent in Tanzania, that’s a win!
9392 2018-11-16 18:34:20 
9393 2018-11-16 18:34:18 I let auto tech do my oil change today and I’ve had 3 kids come up and ask me why I have a pink car seat in the back seat all looking concerned.. 
9394 2018-11-16 18:34:14 Well olive oil is solid at room temp in my house.  If this is true then a total change to the curriculum is required.  Margerine is "solidified" by making it saturated by the hydrogenation process.  Not heard of the opposite and kind of need a good reference-  I teach chemistry
9395 2018-11-16 18:34:10 Lyin' Don and his GOP Crime Cronies think Saudi money and the flow of oil is more important than Jamal Khashoggi's life and the lives of millions of Yemenis. What will they do when their bill comes due? I suggest we start with the War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague?
9396 2018-11-16 18:34:08 This is not what Saudis wear around oil rigs
9397 2018-11-16 18:34:04 wasizakala ,Where is the oil and gas that the learned one proclaimed to all and sundry
9398 2018-11-16 18:34:04 Meatloaf with mashed potatoes, baked sliced up sweet potatoes with olive oil sprinkled on top.
9399 2018-11-16 18:34:03 #AskTheDoctors: I take Bystolic 2.5, Lisinopril 5 & Eliquis 5, how safe is it if I start to take CBD oil???
9400 2018-11-16 18:34:00 Northwestern at Indiana on Dec. 1 has been rescheduled from 5 p.m. to a noon tip at Assembly Hall. NU fans now could hit that game (or watch on @BigTenNetwork) and then still take in Wildcats in Big Ten Championship football game at Lucas Oil Stadium that evening.
9401 2018-11-16 18:33:57 It doesn't because the existence or non existence isnt the reason why it is not a major port for non oil consumables. I just wanted to correct the notion that it is strictly an oil port.
9402 2018-11-16 18:33:30 Don't need more oil what we need is better ways of doing without it .
9403 2018-11-16 18:33:17 I might just have to put my momma on to CBD oil
9404 2018-11-16 18:33:11 Exactly. So why would that be better than No Deal?

Play this out in reality, this CANZUK free trade deal gets to a stage that we are ready to sign. Then Italy blocks it because it doesn't protect their olive oil exports to us, so EU unilaterally blocks the deal.

What then?
9405 2018-11-16 18:32:51 Cross sell for the snake oil, amirite?
9406 2018-11-16 18:32:46 Im convinced that jojoba oil is the best oil to use on your face.
9407 2018-11-16 18:32:37 We had only scant days to reach a boathouse acting as a home for nocturnal creatures, this would end up digging into our cod-liver oil supply.
9408 2018-11-16 18:32:32 Why special exemptions for India ? They buy Russian military equip, Iran Oil & not a true US ally. They want US jobs for their workers but tariff american products & restrictions. Why are we giving them sensitive U.S technology ? - Let them earn it by being a true ally.
9409 2018-11-16 18:32:23 Sometimes I take a bath with oil in it if I’m feeling too lazy to properly lotion after but then I have to scrub out tub because it’s oily af so it’s more work and this is a metaphor for my life I think
9410 2018-11-16 18:32:03 New tires ... oil change ... I think the ole Honda is ready to go head first to the splash
9411 2018-11-16 18:31:57 i set fire to the rain

won't tell you the secret how, it's a magic code
(it's canola oil)
9412 2018-11-16 18:31:56 I’m surprised it took this long for an editorial on this to appear.  Facebook is a social media monopoly and therefore able to control the flow of information worldwide. It needs to be subjected to the same treatment as Standard Oil was 100 years ago, and be broken up.
9413 2018-11-16 18:31:49 Money managers have cut their bullish ICE Brent crude oil bets by 45,216 net-long positions to 214,832, weekly ICE Futures Europe data on futures and options show.
The net-long position was the least bullish in almost 17 months.

9415 2018-11-16 18:31:36 Zhaire had a serious allergic reaction to something he ate (sunflower seed oil or something) and needed a thoracoscopy back in September. The allergic reaction is the reason his return has been delayed supposedly.
9416 2018-11-16 18:31:36 I hope I can fit an oil change into my schedule today.
9417 2018-11-16 18:31:34 For what exactly? Oil, the sale of military aircraft and supplies to the Saudis What? The sale from Boeing for new civilian aircraft.
9418 2018-11-16 18:31:31 You should try our Naturli organic vegan spreadable, taste and melts like butter and No palm oil.. just not in the States yet but 12 other countries.
9419 2018-11-16 18:31:23 It’s the cold air entering the oven that deflates them and olive oil doesn’t get hot enough.

9421 2018-11-16 18:31:20 Also, what resources are we wasting? Estrogen and testosterone aren't finite resources, like oil. They're mass-manufactured and treat a wide variety of hormonal imbalances, including thyroid and even impotency problems in cisgender folks. No danger of running out, mate.
9422 2018-11-16 18:31:18 Fish Oil pills just hit different
9423 2018-11-16 18:31:17 2. Nigeria & Angola have the ability to provide Afrika with refined oil yet they lack in refinery capacity. Afrika (despite Opec trade strictures) can take of its petroleum needs and doesn't need to source oil externally. Why is Angola next door lacking in capacity?
9424 2018-11-16 18:31:16 I really hope we see U.S. shale gas producer discipline. With their new takeaway, if they exercise constraint American producers can finally restore lost value to their trade. A pullback in associated gas also possible. Shale oil pipelines full. I think surprise leans to upside.
9425 2018-11-16 18:31:10 LOL not tea tree oil, it'll kill my cats.

9429 2018-11-16 18:30:51 would they teach a bunch of oil drillers the intricacies of space travel when they could've showed a bunch of cosmonauts how to drill a hole on the asteroid????? or at the very least they could've just thrown an oil dude or two on the space team, but no, for some reason  /35

9436 2018-11-16 18:30:31 Oil MUST be either lard or high smoke point and NOT olive oil. Must be smoking blue before batter put in and then don’t open door at all for min 15 mins and then only gently.
9437 2018-11-16 18:30:29 @CadburyUK love your products but  @cadburyUK use of palm oil is causing huge rain forest destruction. Switch to non palm oil alternatives now so that I can buy your products with a clean conscience

9445 2018-11-16 18:29:24 Yes, Maduro is no Chávez. The latter was charismatic & popular. The primary problem is the lack of diversification of the economy & when oil tanked in ‘14, Maduro did not respond, instead he employed a horrible currency policy, which made matters worse.
9446 2018-11-16 18:29:14 it do not take this long for a oil change
9447 2018-11-16 18:28:57 Car needed oil so I told my mom I’d do it cause I’ve watched my dad do it in the past . And she literally didn’t let me bc she thought I didn’t know how. Oh my madre would’ve saved us both time if I did ittttt

9452 2018-11-16 18:28:34 So allt is about oil!
9453 2018-11-16 18:28:27 My doctor approved it for post-concussion syndrome. @UrbalActiv cbd oil is amazing!
9454 2018-11-16 18:28:25 I have. What is there points to positive results for medical cannabis. And yes, I know many people who have benefitted from it, but you'll dismiss that as anecdotal & call them potheads (including the kids who only get effective pain relief from CBD oil).
9455 2018-11-16 18:27:53 I think it is becoming clear to a few now.
9456 2018-11-16 18:27:51 Wondering what would be the top five items to panic buy before March?

9457 2018-11-16 18:27:45 Here is an interesting factoid. The largest GHG emitter in Atlantic Canada is the Irving refineries that buy oil from Saudi Arabia where there is no carbon tax. Trudeau Liberals consistently look the other way on that as they oppose the Energy East pipeline.
9458 2018-11-16 18:27:42 السلام عليكم
اخي الكريم اسعارك حقيقة في جشع ا لتر ١٢٠
9459 2018-11-16 18:27:37 The only weird taxes I've seen have been for tires and motor oil.
9460 2018-11-16 18:27:31 OMG THIS BITCH IS ABOUT TO GET DONE work at 2 & i’m still on my phone waiting for my body oil to fucking dry. bitch
9461 2018-11-16 18:27:23 Actually there is a terminal in the port that handles non oil consumables. WACT or so.
9462 2018-11-16 18:27:18 My town came across oil, got a full University, boomed to 100,000 people, fell into decay, and until a few years ago we had coyotes in our downtown. My town makes engineers, programmers, and business students only for them to be siphoned off by Dallas, myself included.
9463 2018-11-16 18:27:18 Just spend an hour doing some online research and you will probably be amazed what’s out there. CBD oil doesn’t contain THC which is the compound in cannabis which gets you “high”.

Can’t hurt to look. 
9464 2018-11-16 18:27:15 If Buhari wins. Naira & $ may hover around $1=200. Because 80% of our foreign exchange goes towards fuel importation. Dangote oil will be fully operational 2020. Refinaries nationwide will be fully operational 2019. Reserve will grow we don't pay for imported rice. *Future bright
9465 2018-11-16 18:27:13 Cutting prod may create some serious problems. however multiple solutions are needed to improve the interim situation which is extremely bleak. Maybe oil sands producers should throttle back by 50% for a while if that is even possible technically to do.  The “Not” fumbled bigtime
9466 2018-11-16 18:26:59 oil pastels ?
9467 2018-11-16 18:26:48 I swear women just don’t feel like taking care of their cars. This girl been to lazy to change her oil for 6 months.
9468 2018-11-16 18:26:43 someone once told me to put an extra shirt for me in the diaper bag.. well here I am waiting for an oil change with a mass amount of spit up on my shirt, wishing I had listened to this advice...
9469 2018-11-16 18:26:19 Does billy boy realize that giving oil away at a lower cost than what it costs to produce is not smart?   Billy.. Listen up... Selling oil for less than cost bad bad ... Not good... Not good... Can you see that?  Need a picture? A diagram?   Hmmm.
9470 2018-11-16 18:26:09 At lest my jaguar getting its oil changed.
9471 2018-11-16 18:26:07 Agreed. They probably want a repeat of when Thatcher sold off the 'family jewels' of North Sea Oil licenses to them.
9472 2018-11-16 18:25:58 The guy changing my oil is cute 
9473 2018-11-16 18:25:41 shoutout to Pete for making this dope cover

9477 2018-11-16 18:25:30 Oh, you can treat anything. Ppl been selling snake oil for centuries to treat a number of illnesses. Snake oil is worthless as is Tx for pedophilia but, it gives the State a reason to keep serious offenders reason to keep them locked up longer.
9478 2018-11-16 18:25:29 Ketchup on tacos is how I grew up. I don’t like it on restaurant or fast food tacos, but at home on corn tortillas fried in oil? Yep. Tortilla, hamburger, lettuce, cheese and ketchup. Lol Sounds weird but it reminds me of childhood.
9479 2018-11-16 18:25:28 The Liberals would rather transport oil by the most dangerous and expensive means - rail, ship, truck - rather than by the safest means possible - pipelines + the fact that Trudeau is a coward.  #FIRETHEFEDLIBERALSIN2019 !
9480 2018-11-16 18:25:21 Do you guys have 1 unbelievably busy highway that everyone drives insanely stupid on and it's pretty much the only way in or out of the city and all the cars get poured onto like oil in a funnel too? Please tell me you do because we can't be the only ones who go through that hell
9481 2018-11-16 18:25:00 No trident, bedroom tax, child cap, rape clause, control of all taxes, utilise oil reserves, protect it's NHS, free education, free prescriptions, free care for the elderly, set it's own welfare priorities, not get dragged into illegal wars, not closing our borders..
9482 2018-11-16 18:24:46 I would change my oil myself but I’m so fuckin lazy man, but ya ridiculous! Lol I gotta start hitting the gym again , when I was workin out I stayed with energy and enthusiasm! Now i just pay the dealer to change my oil  
9483 2018-11-16 18:24:34 Just seen Iceland’s Xmas ad - amazing! Can’t quite believe that this brand is highlighting the plight of orangutans / palm oil deforestation... 
9484 2018-11-16 18:24:30 I actually contacted most of them and their community leaders just over a year ago. They were quite adamant that they were only interested in a government bailout to reopen the railway. No oil shipments wanted. By rail or pipeline.
9485 2018-11-16 18:24:27 I’m sure oil has been a major player..
9486 2018-11-16 18:24:26 "oil money - which no longer exists". Hilarious stuff, the small growth in the UK economy the last couple of years was mostly due to increased profits from oil.
9487 2018-11-16 18:24:25 Me putting 100% tea tree oil on my face: skincare :)
9488 2018-11-16 18:24:21 I have no winter tires, I’m sick, my windshield washer fluid light came on, my oil change light came on, I lost my brush to take the snow off.. oh and I need gas.
9489 2018-11-16 18:24:16 Chop it in half, scoop out the yucky stuff. Score it, spray or drizzle with oil, sprinkle sea salt & black pepper and roast for 30 minutes.
It's easy scooped out of the skin then

9500 2018-11-16 18:22:34 Exactly water doesn’t just disappear... matter-of-fact the process that would be used for running a vehicle would actually clean the water.... so it would be a benefit to the water to use it as power for a car... also oil is not a fossil fuel and is also renewable its abiotic....

9502 2018-11-16 18:21:47 I bought a 2018 Chevy Equinox and I’m ready for my first complimentary oil change. Too bad not one dealership allows appointments after 1:00 and the appointment I made online is for a day that isn’t even taking any new appointments. #shouldiquitmyjob @chevrolet

9547 2018-11-16 18:16:28 I think the idea is right, but I'm wondering if we're seeing a chart where extractive industries form a large portion of state GDP? Coal, fracking, oil, etc... Which is a bit more complicated: that coal from WY is used throughout the US

9603 2018-11-16 18:09:44 While you were thinking about small arms, I was going the other way. You'd need your own economy - food supply, money (oil, rare earths, etc). It's as if to have an effective militia, you need a country's worth of strategic resources.

NATO was set up to protect Europe against the U.S.S.R. Now Europe is buying Russia's oil.

9621 2018-11-16 18:08:40 EU russia trade is down by about third over same period or by €100bn to around €289bn. Russia runs trade surplus with EU (bc of oil).

9623 2018-11-16 18:08:25 Just so I understand this correctly. The oil industry has suppressed technology that would have reduced the concern over climate change and now they want taxpayer funding to protect them from the damage they caused? Uh NO!
9624 2018-11-16 18:08:23 It's quite amazing that the oil patch has offered little resistance to the massive assault on the industry, by phony American charities, such as Tides. Billions of dollars have been lost and there is no pushback, against these organizations, or Trudeau ... something is not right!
9625 2018-11-16 18:08:19 And still outside forces pushing more for their own agendas more then ever , it was never about our freedom or human rights or democracy . It’s all about control and power and of course the oil !

They real deal taught oil drillers how to be astronauts instead of astronauts to be drillers, movie big dumb
9628 2018-11-16 18:08:04 It's SAFE AND ITS TRANSPORTATION BY OIL
9629 2018-11-16 18:07:51 The earth is dying we can't pollute we have to stop pollution now not when cars make more money oil natural gas or geothermal it all needs to stop now for humans to live.
9630 2018-11-16 18:07:47 Omg Scott that’s amazing. Do you oil your joints weekly ? 
9631 2018-11-16 18:07:43 vinyl oil cloth. Very easy to wipe down. Bought it on eBay. I have a thing for seasonal oilcloth tablecloths.
9632 2018-11-16 18:07:37 KEEP GOOD NAILS

Make sure fingernails are never dirty. Wear nail polish if you like. If you're not a fan of color on nails, wear clear nail polish. Making the nails stronger and shiny. Try dipping them in olive oil each night, this will help build strong nails and heal cuticles
9633 2018-11-16 18:07:31 The beef is pretty lean, used coconut oil cooking spray, when I flipped the party my sinus opened. Spicy.
9634 2018-11-16 18:07:22 funds all of the media including the Indy Left media(most of it it seems). Nexus is an org full of inherited billionaires and they wanted the oil pipeline in North Dakota even though they act like they care about all people and the earth(they're two-faced)
9635 2018-11-16 18:07:21 there's no reason Canada should be dependant on foreign oil. milk won't work in our furnaces.
9636 2018-11-16 18:07:19 It’s crazy how nothing is ever wrong with your car until you take it to get an oil change...
9637 2018-11-16 18:07:17 I agree! Acrylics are a pain in the bury so I wish you luck with growing out your nails (nail oil is meant to be good!) 
Unfortunately a part of my illness means that my natural nails are paper thin and I’m not allowed to take any vitamins for them, so I can’t really grow mine 
9638 2018-11-16 18:07:15 Damn i need to buy oil for my car 
9639 2018-11-16 18:07:11 oil pens are dead wack they be like 100-150 mg like am i really bouta puff on a gram of bud in liquid form?
9640 2018-11-16 18:07:11 I put together an essential oil blend in a roller bottle for Mark Huffines! It is great! 
If you wanna try essential oils let me know!
Oh, ha please ignore my handwriting

9641 2018-11-16 18:07:00 I think a lot about how the oil companies knew back in the 70s

9643 2018-11-16 18:06:47 Football has gone to the dogs. We all know this. Oil tycoons and other foreign investment group ownerships care little for the fans and communities close to the club. They do however thank the man who helped them price clubs in other countries out of the competition. sad times.
9644 2018-11-16 18:06:43 Thanks for your quick reply. Do your balsam tissues contain extracts of palm oil derivatives?

9648 2018-11-16 18:06:40 Favorite way to use it is in a tuna steak. Put 1tbs of olive oil and 1tbs of butter in a cast iron skillet. Get it HOT. Cover tuna in seasoning. Pan fry for 2 min per side.

Are you free to comment on gvt missteps?

Deal with your reality not bark about political correctness which has not served you in any way.

9653 2018-11-16 18:06:06 Canada has made weed legal. Yet in alberta, where most jobs deal with the oil and gas industry, the drug and alcohol testing remains the same. For regular users this means a failed test and loss of a job. @Canada #cannabiscanada  needs to step in and implement new testing!
9654 2018-11-16 18:05:42 We really wore the same colored jacket, same style, similar Rebecca Minkoff oil slick purses, same iridescent card holder. People are probably annoyed when they’re around us. . Trust it’s unintentional.
9655 2018-11-16 18:05:38 Patiently waiting for that oil money.
9656 2018-11-16 18:05:23 The polluters use government to lie and start wars for taking oil and natural gas bc it's seen as having power when it's death to us all its murder suicide.
9657 2018-11-16 18:05:19 This is FAKE NEWS. Everyone knows that there is no oil left anywhere near any part of Scotland because important people told us in 2014 that there was almost none left. So it must have run out by now.
9658 2018-11-16 18:05:14 Yeah Californians need to move, being the biggest exporter of computers, electronics, transportation equipment, machinery requires people w/ technical skills. Texas exports Oil and Coal, any schmuck can do that so I am glad you are taking away our low skill labor, they need $
9659 2018-11-16 18:05:12 Oh and a big bear flattening, USD & oil lower!
9660 2018-11-16 18:05:09 You work on an oil rig? That's super cool. You should post pictures, I love open water. We've got Lake Michigan up in Milwaukee but the Gulf has to be super cool.
9661 2018-11-16 18:05:04 Sure. However Harper laid the framework for years of great investment.  Maybe, more Canadians will see it’s not just the oil patch taking it on the chin. Notely and Golden Trust Fund Boy has got to go.
9662 2018-11-16 18:05:01 Ohh please . Capitalism cares less about people and the environment. Get off your high horse . Like Oil  spills & tech companies over working employees for no over time pay . If corps in the Us gave more to education & their communities America would have less problems .
9663 2018-11-16 18:04:58 Is there choline in dr Mercola’s krill oil ?
9664 2018-11-16 18:04:16 Deep thought: maybe coconut oil can even heal incels, since it uses "unrefined" and "virgin" as selling points right on the jar
9665 2018-11-16 18:04:12 Can confirm. The matches are from Norway and there is no search for oil on the mainland. This is natural release.

9679 2018-11-16 18:02:42 Their legislation is generally toothless, they supported big oil for years, and still do and still work with them, when was the last time a dem said we need to stop subsidizing oil and start subsidizing solar, Dems do almost nothing to make solar be more viable

9683 2018-11-16 18:02:17 You can’t get around using oil.  They are trying they have put up bike lanes every where to deter people from driving downtown.  The reality is they don’t have the infrastructure to set up an alternative and the cost would be immense.  With oil they know what they have.
9684 2018-11-16 18:01:59 And US is still the 3rd largest oil produce in the world.

9721 2018-11-16 17:58:12 Yes we'd already be out of the EU. As for austerity, I'm not sure what we'd be doing as the oil tax revenues about £8bn pa less than the White Paper envisaged.

9723 2018-11-16 17:57:59 It's the risk perception as a country and out debt servicing costs will be higher for a country that touts it's debt to GDP less than 20%. 

What's broken about Nigeria is the overdependence of oil revenues that puts us in a volatile state.

9728 2018-11-16 17:57:31 It's awfully telling that I was knocked from the group now that I have this info. They (he) doesn't want it being known. Their credibility is rock bottom in my view.... Just like 90% of stocks they've pumped and then exited before a collapse.
9729 2018-11-16 17:57:29 It can be. There are a lot of people who go shampoo free. It doesn't work for everyone, though. I get greasy after two days.

To be fair, I use a pre styling texture spray from Aveda and a oil based clay for styling so that probably contributes to the grease.
9730 2018-11-16 17:57:28 Agree. Now stop electing Republicans who continue scheming with the Saudis for Oil wars.
9731 2018-11-16 17:57:25 Correct me if I'm wrong, but the only bad air we've breathed in Oregon (other than patchouli oil) comes from the burning forests which have been mismanaged by our own state government. I have some ideas on how you can "Clear the air,"

9741 2018-11-16 17:56:37 NDP will not legislate sales tax on Albertans - too close to elex & UCP, Cons, & media would hammer them mercilessly. 
But I would put money that if UCP gets in they will impose one bc of the current economic climate (dwindling revenue from oil & gas). & they must cut taxes to 1%
9742 2018-11-16 17:56:35 I will never understand why people walk up to me...the cashier...and say they need an oil change ...... like yeah for sure Bitch ..pull right up to the register and I’ll do it right here.

9766 2018-11-16 17:54:17 Pls is it possible we consider d NASS and its Slash Capital project for Constituency projects action..(i remember seeing Saraki on video asserting that he cut d Lag-Ibad exp budget), Crude Oil prices, then & even now, pms Landing costs/Subsidies, may be confounding factors..?
9767 2018-11-16 17:54:10 I thought it was from the oil of his enemies or Starscream's take on psychological warfare using childish pranks on old Mega Megs here.
9768 2018-11-16 17:54:02 Ex government employee who lives off money from Alberta. If he had character he would refuse to accept his pension that is paid by Alberta oil
9769 2018-11-16 17:53:59 Don't worry - it will be gone and the oil running out soon enough...
9770 2018-11-16 17:53:52 You mean Trump?
9771 2018-11-16 17:53:51 How did Pastor Mboro afford to buy such an expensive speaker for Kgosi hahahaha the Holly oil business is doing fine neh #ScandalEtv #etvScandal
9772 2018-11-16 17:53:46 6 Extraction costs 17-21$/b at 60$ per barrel of oil profit is 40$per b
7. profit $4.8m per day
THIS IS A WILD EXTRAPOLATION BUT SHOWS SIZE OF END PRIZE
9773 2018-11-16 17:53:38 BofAML notes that for any meaningful credit losses in high yield, oil has to decline further to $35-$40 range.
9774 2018-11-16 17:53:37 This day has been shitty lol
9775 2018-11-16 17:53:29 Water quenching is still very common. Oil quenching can add carbon in the outer crystals and give unwanted properties.
9776 2018-11-16 17:53:27 Yes girl! $30 it's imitation hair that can take heat. I had to flat iron it with oil sheen to make it slick again but it's the best thing I've ever bought
9777 2018-11-16 17:53:20 J.Trudeau should have bought a refinery for Alberta not entire pipeline so if they must ship oil it would be cleaner. go solar and drive smaller cars and go green if you can. 
CANADIANS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO DECIDE ON NEW VOTING SYSTEM. WE ARE NOT RACIST AND ALL ON THE RIGHT.hand!x
9778 2018-11-16 17:52:53 Damn so what ever happened to that BP oil spill  I know they aint clean dat shit up
9779 2018-11-16 17:52:52 When government finds weed in 
your compound, its yours and you are arrested..
But when they find oil/other natural resources, its government property.
9780 2018-11-16 17:52:45 I love the taste of palm oil in the morning.
9781 2018-11-16 17:52:43 เก็บช่วงเวลาดีๆแบบนี้ไว้ ไม่รู้ว่าจะเป็นแบบนี้ตลอดไปหรือป่าว
9782 2018-11-16 17:52:20 #EventuallyWeWillAll be oil that will fuel the cars of evolutionary advanced cockroaches.
9783 2018-11-16 17:52:08 Oil looks like it could have been a stop run
9784 2018-11-16 17:52:07 El que se le ocurrió por primera vez echarle truffle oil al Mac and cheese se merece un premio Nobel de la paz.
9785 2018-11-16 17:52:04 @fredbeansauto You serviced a car we bought from your Nissan dealership; oil, tires rotated & inspection. Charge was $163.00. Last week, my wife had her Camry serviced for the exact services; $29.00 where she bought it. 
Now that’s customer loyalty. No rewards program needed
9786 2018-11-16 17:52:03 Depends on the oil && how hard you pull
9787 2018-11-16 17:51:51 Im petite naturally but I am getting so skinny ! shout-out to my slimfast shakes , oil pens and occasional juul hits
9788 2018-11-16 17:51:51 Mechanic question - if your vehicle’s owner’s manual does not call for synthetic oil, does it need synthetic oil?
9789 2018-11-16 17:51:31 I agree that they are looking at alternatives to the dollar & those alternatives will have to be gold based. The US would never volunteer to move to any system. That's our achilles heel. I think your thesis is too immersed in oil whose influence has waned considerably over 20 yrs
9790 2018-11-16 17:51:23 Well, in the absence of a golden shower of oil $, there's always an alternative...
9791 2018-11-16 17:51:22 omg after my psych class i have to go get an oil change and marty i’m SCARED i hate doing stuff like this
9792 2018-11-16 17:51:10 What about cooking with coconut oil?
9793 2018-11-16 17:51:08 You are likely a bot, but full of sh*t regardless. A small Tesla is far less than that. AS YOU WELL KNOW, rebate is for  charging system. Oil, gas & auto bailouts are fine for #ScheerFordMaxJasonBots, though.
9794 2018-11-16 17:50:56 @realDonaldTrump Let immigrants earn their citizenship by building the wall with 2 yrs, pd labor, staying in FEMA trailers in Mexico, until time & the citizenship requirements are met.  Huge Wall: private maglev train on top, fiber, utilities, oil inside like Chinese wall.
9795 2018-11-16 17:50:44 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
9796 2018-11-16 17:50:41 “Yes I’ll have your tall pumpkin spice brake pads, and a venti oil change...”
9797 2018-11-16 17:50:37 They would rather see the oil industry in Canada destroyed.  Just raise taxes for more money, right?  And we all accept it like stupid sheep.
9798 2018-11-16 17:50:29 New position #Caml up 5% since buying back in yesterday, #GKP didn't responded to #OIL rise this morning, but fell back on the decline this afternoon. #Nccl disappointing response to RNS. It will have its day tho! #Infa the big winner, penny starting to drop? +20%

PF Up 2.3%
9799 2018-11-16 17:50:21 I would LOVE to know how they get those bows on, without at least part of the visible ribbon getting all shitty and oil stained.
 
IT CANNOT BE DONE.
9800 2018-11-16 17:50:15 Saying no to palm oil is GREAT but that’s not where it ends, after boycotting P/O there will have to be alternatives which are less efficient and will cause more harm than good...
9801 2018-11-16 17:50:12 #Oil #OOTT #WTI 
WTI has gone up and down like a roller coaster. If you cannot take the ride, don't trade WTI.
9802 2018-11-16 17:50:08 LMAO!!  “Megaphone “ ??!!

TRUTH: Prices Declined to Institutional Demand on Tuesday—And Price Advanced Higher.  But Huge Institutional Supply above Current Price!
Bottom Line: Longterm = Lower Oil & Gas Products!
Short Term: Probably a Little Higher!
#MarketTimer
9803 2018-11-16 17:50:06 I personally use the room temperature semi solid one. As soon as you rub it a little it melts into the oil.
9804 2018-11-16 17:50:06 Does castor oil help hair grow?
9805 2018-11-16 17:50:01 @realDonaldTrump talks about China n we pop... so does WTI. High oil will kill a jolly Xmas!
9806 2018-11-16 17:50:00 Nah I liked the bill she got thru senete that tied secretary of interior from changing the approved list for oil and gas on national park la lands HR 2248 or  reinsurance of dream act.  but hey that’s me
9807 2018-11-16 17:50:00 Hi Julia, we have no direct use of palm oil in our products, only some of our products have extracts of derivatives of Palm oil. However, we do support the aims of RSPO, the development of criteria for sustainable palm oil and third party verification of its production.
9808 2018-11-16 17:49:56 Use High grade aid - the most high rated online dispensary right now they still have a lot of oil stock
9809 2018-11-16 17:49:54 Hahahahaha FOK apekacent oil aka Yager bahahaha
9810 2018-11-16 17:49:42 Oil=plastic=everything!
9811 2018-11-16 17:49:39 Striking Viking beard oil is my go to. Health level over 9000
9812 2018-11-16 17:49:37 I feel like I really stay on top of shit. I always turn my assignments in on time, get my oil changed when I’m supposed to, keep my car and room clean. Realizing things like this about myself make me feel a little less like a piece of shit 
9813 2018-11-16 17:49:30 Other than the environmental concerns, which I grant are legitimate, what are your concerns with olive oil, canola oil, palm oil, etc?
9814 2018-11-16 17:49:20 @BurgerKing why do you fry cheesy tots in same oil as onion rings???? Yuk I don't want onion tots
9815 2018-11-16 17:49:16 Braw, we'll keep our oil, whisky, water and renewables, to name a few. Giving you Trident though.
9816 2018-11-16 17:49:14 Captain water, 2 long islands, epikascent oil.....

9818 2018-11-16 17:49:08 #UKOG #HORSEHILL Wether oil free flows or is pumped who cares!

Flows are fantastic. It's a shame that MMs and shorts, traders and Swampies fill the internet with scare mongering bullshit.
9819 2018-11-16 17:49:01 Bought 50 shares of GUSH.  OPEC and friends will do everything they can to get oil back up to $70.
9820 2018-11-16 17:48:55 뭔데... 뭐 저리 빨라..

9822 2018-11-16 17:48:41 Just learned that Nutella killed all the orangutans...rhinos..tigers. Ugh I love Nutella, Y U gotta have that palm oil tho.
9823 2018-11-16 17:48:33 Other than the fact that the palm oil is not ethically sourced, what is your problem with canola and olive oil?

9827 2018-11-16 17:47:55 Squeakiest wheel gets the most oil.
9828 2018-11-16 17:47:43 Vape odor from the oil is miniscule. The smoke unlike vap from nicotine cartridges is very small because you don't roast the oil like you do with nicotine oils. Other than edibles it is by far the most discreet way for consuming cannibus in public. #Hypocrites
9829 2018-11-16 17:47:36 good for you la. how much ni? alia ingat nak try jugak tamanu oil ni tapi nak try beli from takeitglobal dulu and see how it goes from there

9831 2018-11-16 17:47:26 Maybe get worse countries like Saudi Arabia that murders dissidents overseas, Iran which is a state sponsor of terrorism, and Russia to stop their production first before we phase out our oil sands. Oh wait, those countries don't have freedom of speech...

9833 2018-11-16 17:47:05 Do you think the cashier would get in trouble? If yes, stop. If no, it might be hard to resist Robin Hood-ing a giant oil company.
9834 2018-11-16 17:47:03 That has no tires and is sitting on blocks in the front yard rusting out and leaking oil into the ground.
9835 2018-11-16 17:47:03 Liquid coconut oil or like the room temperature semi solid one?
9836 2018-11-16 17:46:46 BofAML:  Between 2014-2016, "HY energy came under initial pressure at current levels of oil prices because most capital structures were built with $100/bbl assumptions." After the drop to sub-$30 level, survivors built cap structures when oil was in $45-$55 range.
9837 2018-11-16 17:46:35 Clean Green Energy & Green Jobs is the Future & Progress , coal , oil , gas is backwards thinking as is Trump's ignorance to science & climate change .
9838 2018-11-16 17:46:33 七瀬さんのドキュメンタリーみて

9840 2018-11-16 17:46:24 I hating getting my oil changed, I don’t have no patience
9841 2018-11-16 17:46:14 Well, I think corporate Canada awaits a frickin oil pipeline!  Justin needs to do something that helps the Canadian economy instead of mollycoddling the reds and greens from la la land.
9842 2018-11-16 17:46:08 Why is oil down over $2 bucks in the last 2 hours? It's QE 4 dummies.
9843 2018-11-16 17:46:07 It’s better for your skin! As soon as you put the coconut oil on the makeup washes away like butter, it’s nuts. And then just take a warm cloth to wipe away any extra makeup left behind. It’s a game changer. More moisturizing, and all natural instead of using make up wipes.
9844 2018-11-16 17:46:04 Thanks @autozone for your good deals! After a sale and my rebate, I was able to change my oil for just around $3! Beats a shop any day
#oilchange #car #DealsAndSteals
9845 2018-11-16 17:45:59 is baby oil made by real or artificial babies?
9846 2018-11-16 17:45:56 2) we spent multiple trillion dollars and thousands of lives in wars to protect allies in middle East who share no common values with us - just so that we can burn gasoline in our ICE vehicles cheaply. Remember the oil shock?
9847 2018-11-16 17:45:48 ...and quit playing and HMU I can make you a face wash and oil for you 
9848 2018-11-16 17:45:47 I'm shedding as bad as the dog  going to slather castor oil in my hair for the rest of the day
9849 2018-11-16 17:45:37 We need Jason Kenny to set the price of oil higher.
9850 2018-11-16 17:45:24 Hydrogenation is a problem. That's why I buy brands that are non-hydrogenated or have only trace amounts of hydrogenated oil (again, butter has natural trans fat, so the difference is negligible)
9851 2018-11-16 17:45:13 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist
9852 2018-11-16 17:45:09 He’s not gonna kill nothin bro he’s got no snake oil or premium cigarettes
9853 2018-11-16 17:45:04 You do know that speeding laws only apply to mechanically-propelled vehicles? The law defines that as any vehicle propelled by petrol,oil,gas,steam or electricity.
Notice what's missing there?
9854 2018-11-16 17:45:02 Hi, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. We’re passionate wherever
9855 2018-11-16 17:44:40 Invasion of Privacy at #1 and they put Canola Oil on the list? Keep it
9856 2018-11-16 17:44:36 Stop lying to yourself. Admit it you don't care about the peoples. You just needed the oil or the distraction of the country. Everyone knows that. How come you don't know that?
9857 2018-11-16 17:44:33 "The nastiest and phoniest things in the world cannot be ingested or even fondled - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
9858 2018-11-16 17:44:26 1) Give him some slack. He is not forcing people to buy EVs. He is making EVs so compelling that people buy them on their own. The subsidy he gets dwarfs the direct and indirect subsidies that big oil and legacy ICE car makers get. For example...
9859 2018-11-16 17:44:25 Gotta love it when a CEO whose firm has noisily divested from Canadian oil sands comes to tell us that we’ve got a problem with competitiveness. Same firm brokering deal to make Saudi Arabia’s Aramco world’s biggest ever IPO.
9860 2018-11-16 17:44:19 Horse hill oil exploration site announced to their investors yesterday the equivalent to having flared (burned off) 1.5 million cubic feet of gas. Let’s address that as well as cars.
9861 2018-11-16 17:44:10 You treat these like these are two separate economies.

The food supplied to people in America to eat comes from where? Or even the sources of energy (e.g., coal, oil) to drive this other economy?

More consideration is needed here.
9862 2018-11-16 17:44:06 Frugal Tip of the Day
In frying, wait for the oil to heat up then reduce heat from high to medium. This will save you some gas if you're using a gas stove, or energy if you use electric stoves. Also, it prevents the food from getting overcooked or from burning.
9863 2018-11-16 17:43:30 BofAML: "Lower oil brought memories of the 2014-16 meltdown, however these parallels are misleading. HY energy can live with $55 oil."
9864 2018-11-16 17:43:26 Or another case of the rooster taking credit for the dawn.  SALT refugees in low tax states have been doing this for decades.
9865 2018-11-16 17:43:21 Agree , aviation business is a very risky business. The industry is very susceptible to oil price fluctuations. Any model other than indigo is very difficult to work in india.
9866 2018-11-16 17:43:19 Need to go get this oil change 
9867 2018-11-16 17:43:05 Sustainability??? So why do you use non sustainable Palm oil in your sausages & burgers??? I’m surprised & disappointed & won’t be buying them in future. The price of your products does not justify the use of this cheap & environmentally damaging ingredient
9868 2018-11-16 17:42:49 Try some cbd oil from Holland and barrett. It's mainly help oil. I'm told it works for pains. Worth a try. If not try migraine tablets. More water is a good suggestion too. I'd see a doc personally. You shouldn't be getting them for so long.
9869 2018-11-16 17:42:34 L'importation de cette merde de gaz oil coûte 44milliards par an à notre balance commerciale qui est déficitaire de 42milliards (source LCP:Diesel une exception française) Les accidents de la route coûtent à la collectivité plus de 60 milliards par an. Qui sont les vaches à lait?
9870 2018-11-16 17:42:29 why does the no frizz oil that works for my hair have to cost so much 
9871 2018-11-16 17:42:24 Slavery still exists.
Poor countries (which do not have gas, gold, oil and everything else) live well.
And rich countries always live in war.
Parasites have come up with how to control the world.

9872 2018-11-16 17:42:22 Do YOU think before your tweet?? EE was a multi-product pipeline carrying that "nasty" diluted bitumen but also light conventional Alberta oil and Bakken oil both of which are fantastic raw products for refin.   Plus likely future upgrades to handle syn. crude or event raw bit.
9873 2018-11-16 17:42:20 Loved @hasanminhaj #PatriotAct episode on oil. Glad to see a show and host with balls to call out oil barons and the absurdity of governments to not attempt to make a better earth.

I'll watch the She-Ra reboot this weekend and be a better person from it.
(Can I do it around my car's oil change?  Ruby hit the 200,000 mile mark a few days ago, and I want to celebrate with a couple quarts.)
9876 2018-11-16 17:42:01 Your ‘woe is me’ act won’t fly; You will be known to history as a two-timing, bamboozling, party-before-country snake oil salesman who nearly killed American democracy.

9878 2018-11-16 17:41:57 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
9879 2018-11-16 17:41:47 Do you have access to any pure peppermint oil? If you do, pop a drop on your thumb and then press your thumb to the roof of your mouth and hold it for like 10 seconds... pop a warm washer over your eyes and a heat pack under your neck and close your eyes! Works a treat! 
9880 2018-11-16 17:41:40 someone teach me to do an oil change in my car plz
9881 2018-11-16 17:41:39 Non mais il se  fou de nous     si le gas oil est si nocif pourquoi encore vendre des voitures neuves   et les avions et les bateaux sur les côtes  vraiment on nous prends pour des cons

9884 2018-11-16 17:41:12 Oil: WTI surged as much as 2.1%, narrowing its sixth weekly loss, amid growing confidence that OPEC+ will reduce production to avert a glut next year
Oil (v/=) *Seems mostly technical, maybe DXY-related
9885 2018-11-16 17:41:09 Stop drillin' you hit OIL! I got a real Morrison vibe just from the roster. It is very Batmen of All Nations.
9886 2018-11-16 17:41:08 It’s crazy how many elderly people come in GNC and ask if we carry CBD oil.

9890 2018-11-16 17:40:47 “You don’t know the cost of the oil in my Alabaster box”  
YES Thank you, Jesus 
9891 2018-11-16 17:40:44 We make the dollar strong by selling oil in dollars we help to prevent your economy from falling stupid
9892 2018-11-16 17:40:44 Oil sheen spray or baby oil  thank me later 
9893 2018-11-16 17:40:31 not with the weight of science behind it The number don't lie, oil/gas extraction & use produce far more carbon emissions than the production & use of a battery. The only way oil/gas win is when the study does NOT include extraction & refining of the oil before it gets to the car
9894 2018-11-16 17:40:31 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
9895 2018-11-16 17:40:28 Oil prices rose sharply with US WTI up $1.33 to $57.79 during early trading in New York.

9900 2018-11-16 17:39:31 I was getting my oil changed today and heard one of the mechanics quote you. It made me smile! Thanks to you, and crypto dog, I caught the bottom of the crash yesterday. I don't day trade, but your advice is so helpful to those with less expertise.  Thank You!!!
9901 2018-11-16 17:39:23 มาถามแล้วพอเล่าให้ฟังก็ไม่ฟัง ทำหน้าทำตาเบื่อโลก คือไรวะ
9902 2018-11-16 17:39:17 Oil in a days work 
9903 2018-11-16 17:39:13 I knew something funky going on with oil.  Some operators were told to return their oil trucks rather than haul for pipeline.
9904 2018-11-16 17:39:01 why the hell banks put a limit on online transfers from savings to checking n i just find this out when my phones on 2% and im getting my oil changed stranded at walmart?????
9905 2018-11-16 17:38:59 AMERICA IS NUMBER ONE!!! 
The number one producer of crude oil
The number one place to get shot at school
The highest health care costs!!!!
USA, NUMBER 1.
9906 2018-11-16 17:38:52 Part of England? What the fuck prove there that people think Scotland as a region of England its disgusting wave cheerio to oil , whisky , gin soft drinks , Spring water , Scottish GM crop free meat, fish , wind energy.
9907 2018-11-16 17:38:47 It's also not really a problem. Plastics are made from crude oil, it is a natural product, just as natural as wood ones and you don't keep going on about the waste from those as if they are a 'problem'.
9908 2018-11-16 17:38:43 This week we would love donations of long life fruit juice, uht milk, shower gel, corned beef and cooking oil please
9909 2018-11-16 17:38:42 I’m fighting off a goddamn cold but I still came into work today. Mostly because facilities was in to hang art in our new offices and I needed to pick where things went. Also I managed to snag an original oil painting that museums apparently doesn’t know about.
9910 2018-11-16 17:38:40 @narendramodi @RahulGandhi @IndianOilcl In international market oil prices are going down in dollars each day but consumer is passed benefits only in paise? Why prices are not decreased at the same rate while the trend is opposite when you need to increase prices.
9911 2018-11-16 17:38:16 Recommended preperation is to pan sear in olive oil with garlic and shallots.
9912 2018-11-16 17:38:12 Wow now I’m aggressively craving mct oil
9913 2018-11-16 17:38:08 US crude oil jumped $1.41 to $57.90 per barrel helping petroleum stocks rise, BP was ahead 1.5p to 528.5p.
9914 2018-11-16 17:38:01 You gotta pan roast the veggies with olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper!!! Maybe a lil Italian seasoning if you feel some type of way
9915 2018-11-16 17:37:58 I’m in.
9916 2018-11-16 17:37:57 i was wrong on $oil today, the manipulation is still here going to the option expiration date.  should the bull panic???  not me!
9917 2018-11-16 17:37:43 Yes, it looks like oil, but.....
9918 2018-11-16 17:37:22 I would accept this if the salad had an oil based dressing, otherwise no. Back me up here @dana_khafaf
9919 2018-11-16 17:37:18 With oil prices plummeting to $14US the industry & Canadian Gov't (that’s us) are losing historic amounts of revenue. Conversely the price at the pump has dropped a mere few cents. Five cents in our area $1.34 L. We are being screwed at both ends. Trudeau's solution,add more tax!
9920 2018-11-16 17:37:14 @JustinTrudeau , shit for brains Trudeau had to have known this was coming ! Trudeau looking after his Quebec cronies! Who needs western oil ? But let’s make sure everyone gets a ski doo !
9921 2018-11-16 17:37:12 We make the dollar strong by selling oil in dollars. We should help stop Iran's support for terrorists
9922 2018-11-16 17:37:05 All these problems are because of natural gas and oil starting wars bc they don't want to stop profiting from our demise. They need to liquidate their business and give all their money to all the areas they started wars. Pay for refugee housing food.
9923 2018-11-16 17:37:00 Sorry, buy that beard oil they keep advertising on the tl and rub am for your head
9924 2018-11-16 17:36:34 My dad suggested it, but I would never be told. He did oil rigs, I did post-hole alignments. He's gone. I'm still counting alignments.
9925 2018-11-16 17:36:30 Put too much hair oil in my hair and I unintentionally did the Kim K wet hair look and news flash I don’t look as good as she does
9926 2018-11-16 17:36:25 the extraction of oil will happen regardless of it being made into gasoline. The country couldn't survive a single day without it
9927 2018-11-16 17:36:23 perhaps the flu jab contains chicken egg white or chicken yolk? nut oil? soya? dairy? Should your GP or nurse ask if you are allergic or intolerant of these ingredients?
9928 2018-11-16 17:36:08 Actually, a lot of oil mills are already doing it. Using the palm oil effluent as feeder to generate methane, capture it, then use at a gas engine. Traditional methods would involve just burning the palm oil biomass to produce steam to run a steam turbine to generate electricity.
9929 2018-11-16 17:36:04 When I see Quebec buying Alberta oil.
9930 2018-11-16 17:36:01 I only use the cream on my body. My face is stupidly sensitive. My current regiment is Bliss Fab Foaming face wash followed by an oil from the Body Shop. I find oil works better than lotion for me on my face.
9931 2018-11-16 17:35:57 วันนี้นอนดึกไม่มาก พรุ่งนี้สิถึงจะนอนดึกเลย รอดูฝนดาวตก
9932 2018-11-16 17:35:57 USA has been the number 1 polluter since 1960 until 2005. Bruh USA ruined the World. Now be killing ppl for Oil saying they need democracy
9933 2018-11-16 17:35:49 Argan oil works wonders for acne scars! 10/10 recommend hun!
9934 2018-11-16 17:35:45 Naw, that canny be right. There's nae oil left. That's what we were told by "experts".
9935 2018-11-16 17:35:41 Need to get my oil change and some tires on Monday
9936 2018-11-16 17:35:27 Kelewele seller be like: "Not be kelewele alone wey Ghanaman go eat survive, but every news wey concern budget plus corrupt politicians"

The way kelewele oil dey anoint dema newspaper self...Charlie....

9938 2018-11-16 17:35:07 VEH DEBRIS // ON LEFT SIDE OIL SPILLED ALL OVER ST
9939 2018-11-16 17:35:02 é que vegano ou não é relativo, se você full defende os direitos dos animais e a proteção deles, mesmo a lays não tendo fisicamente nada de origem animal é extensão da PepsiCo que é uma das empresas que mais planta Conflict Palm Oil (e isso destrói floresta pra caralho)
9940 2018-11-16 17:34:45 Who tf broke oil again ??
9941 2018-11-16 17:34:25 Here’s a friendly reminder that some of our Tints and Spray Tan solutions contain nut oil, please always let us know any allergies you may have before you book your appointments!
9942 2018-11-16 17:34:23 Yes George does explain to Dan Bongino that the spying on him was likely due to his activity in the oil and gas industry in Europe.

He may have been an unwitting patsy for the FBI. Podesta likely knew they could dirty him up.
9943 2018-11-16 17:34:21 Homebuilders, EM and High yield are the red flags from the fed. Rest is idiosyncratic and can be explained away. Nvidia took a hit because of Bitcoin, oil over production. High yield scares the hell out of me right now. GE and Ford junk downgrade might be the triggers.
9944 2018-11-16 17:34:17 There's nary a candle nor a drop of whale oil in this desolate abode.
9945 2018-11-16 17:34:15 All short Videos of my PSPB Marathon Fitness workshop at different Oil Companies in Delhi NCR.
Each video shows the enthusiasm among the employees who attended my workshop.
9946 2018-11-16 17:34:13 Should cooked in non-stick, less oil more health.
9947 2018-11-16 17:34:09 And what is the likely ridiculous reasoning the govt uses to explain not buying Alberta Oil?...
9948 2018-11-16 17:34:02 @randhir_kalsi Hi everyone.
I need suggestions for my car which I bought on 22/9/18 . I face off engine oil leakage problem on same day. I sent the WhatsApp to Showroom sales guy he said that it’s due to Raina &greasing. In my first service adviser told my seal is broken and leak
9949 2018-11-16 17:34:00 See also: cut grass, clean fishtank, check tyre pressure and oil levels, stare out the window, have a bath, fold t-shirts, go for a walk, polish shoes, tidy desk, clean gross keyboard, perform an eye test on yourself with a ruler, try every single font, set app preferences...
9950 2018-11-16 17:33:55 Kayanya gw akan coba beli almond oil.. Kaget dong kmrn 3 hari di sumedang nyoba almonnya yara buat jerawat gede di deket idung trus 3 hari kering?? Like??? Wow?? Huhehehu im tired of this acne :((

9952 2018-11-16 17:33:36 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
9953 2018-11-16 17:33:34 are you arguing FOR the extraction of oil or that it is cleaner to burn than making and using a battery ... make up your mind.
9954 2018-11-16 17:33:28 Exports of Finished Goods must increase. We have been exporting Services, unfinished Goods & natural resources, best fruits, vegetables, grains, oil, meats, cement, ores, &  It brings ₹ devaluation in long run. This is Loot ! China still doesn't mind a deficit in Services sector
9955 2018-11-16 17:33:23 Add more razor wire... get the rubber bullets out... get skunk oil like Israel uses...and use that weapon that raises their body temp...
9956 2018-11-16 17:33:08 Leisman should be taken off CNBC. Why is the dude trying to defend the Fed rate hikes? All he does is quote nonsense like the market is down 5%, WTH? Here's whats in bear market market: Housing, Semi-conductor, Heavy Machinery, Fin, Oil, China, Commodities, FANG. LISTEN TO CRAMER
9957 2018-11-16 17:32:50 Official stated fed policy is now to phase out oil and gas industry, aligning Cda with our UN/EU masters. Only hope for AB is to separate. Or #Scheer4PM
9958 2018-11-16 17:32:49 溶岩に落ちたものは全部なくなるからね…
9959 2018-11-16 17:32:45 When you start diggin into the products that contain palm oil it’s scary! And the lack of alternatives is quite frankly shocking. Don’t think I’ll ever eat or wash again! But 8 of us in the office today signed a pledge to endeavour to go palm free @ work-baby steps #wildlifefirst
9960 2018-11-16 17:32:44 Two factors elided in this essay include brain drain from science of anyone who can't do the poverty and humiliation, and more broadly oil price uncertainty since 1973, which has significantly curtailed investment in energy-intensive technology. Solar all the things!
9961 2018-11-16 17:32:39 Hempseed Oil
9962 2018-11-16 17:32:28 CAD is catching up quickly with USD, Crude Oil heading to USD 55.00/bbl
9963 2018-11-16 17:32:14 Imagine loool in asian, I'm one curry spill away from having africa mapped on my hoodie in oil 
9964 2018-11-16 17:32:12 Thank you.  And skeptics are free to be skeptical too...  We need them as well.  But covering it (data and past FDA on MIneral Oil) is a start.  I really do appreciate you and others I won't name who expose slime in this industry for the real good of everyone.  $AMRN

I need suggestions for my scross alphacar which I bought on 22/9/18 . I face off engine oil leakage problem on same day. I sent the WhatsApp to Showroom sales guy he said that it’s due to Raina &greasing. In my first service adviser told my seal is broken and leaked.

9967 2018-11-16 17:32:09 Just tell em there's 250 billion barrels of oil under Newcastle. They'd bring us some Freedom faster than the Pennywell Pit Crew could strip your Corsa.
9968 2018-11-16 17:32:06 Oil and vinegar is the best salad dressing. This is etched in stone
9969 2018-11-16 17:32:02 Oil production is at record highs,
Unemployment at record lows

The largest single foreign investment in Canada's history $40 billion for the LNG plant.

And Imperial Oil just announced a $2.6 billion oil sands project last week.

You can sit down now #FaikingAndy
9970 2018-11-16 17:31:58 Time for miracle oil  #etvScandal

9972 2018-11-16 17:31:53 1. Take a break from those lipsticks 
2. Sugar scrub 
3. AVOID LICKING YOUR LIPS 
4. Don't leave the house without applying chapstick if you don't have any coconut oil is the best substitute 
5. Apply coconut oil before bed
9973 2018-11-16 17:31:51 so 50k bpd from Kirkuk tanked oil 3%, despite a big USD selloff?   sheeesh
9974 2018-11-16 17:31:51 I’m being packed in with fertilizer and fuel oil pushed over a cliff by a suicidal Mickey Mouse.
9975 2018-11-16 17:31:44 Fair point. Looks good in hindsight but would have been tough to time. Oil went straight up while SPY outperformed EEM.
9976 2018-11-16 17:31:36 and oil will still be extracted for the other things you use daily made from petroleum products
9977 2018-11-16 17:31:28 @CarbonaUSA So do you put out large containers of Stain Devils. Especially motor oil....
9978 2018-11-16 17:31:25 Oil price reversed earlier gains, now trading 30 cents lower at $56.30.
9979 2018-11-16 17:31:13 Drenched in blood stained oil
9980 2018-11-16 17:31:07 Sir Gas or Oil free kab kaha tha Modi ji ne  itna mat feko aap to lagta hi RaGa ko bhi fail kar denge jhooth bolne me 
9981 2018-11-16 17:30:46 Whip together 1 pound daily bread with 4 tsps crab. Blend with Olive Oil. Roast. Serve to your worst enemy.
9982 2018-11-16 17:30:37 Decline. Other people move away from oil and gas exploration while simultaneously distancing himself from it.
9983 2018-11-16 17:30:35 @SkyNews 800,000 sign up in 4 days to see the iceland palm oil advert, how longs it took to get 60,000 to sign up for a leaders debate.
9984 2018-11-16 17:30:33 Please such BS..Bush went  only 4 times and he started this Sh-- with Cheney both are War Criminal and always will be,i dont care that he and Michelle share a mint,why doesnt he ask the parents that lost children to his Oil Greed Problem,saying it lightly.
Obama was a Great Prez.
9985 2018-11-16 17:30:28 Gonna get a massage on mass street and I just know they're gonna try to charge me $35 to rub tea tree oil on their hands and hold them in front of my face for 30 seconds
9986 2018-11-16 17:30:27 I didn't think it did but I looked it up and it happens to be in an area that does have oil.
9987 2018-11-16 17:30:22 @LagosTalks913 y efe come dey tell us how much remain,?  Abi him want make we help am.  Y e no talk since we y d money dey.  Abeg make him go lick oil
9988 2018-11-16 17:30:19 Looks like oil spilling into equities now...
9989 2018-11-16 17:30:13 That is the fundamental problem most Nigerians have failed to realize. They failed to narrow all the economic problems to the root, which is the fluctuating oil price. They even questioned FG's long term but result-oriented policies. May God open their eyes.
9990 2018-11-16 17:30:02 All a brown person really needs is a camera flash and coconut oil
9991 2018-11-16 17:30:01 Tbh I think Scotland should walk anyway. This is like watching an Artic hurtling towards you & waiting till the very last moment to jump aside. The smart personn would move now just in case there's oil/black ice/whatever on the road.
9992 2018-11-16 17:30:00 Crude oil markets instilling real confidence for the bulls today. #sarcasm
9993 2018-11-16 17:29:55 I don’t know why my brother won’t let me teach him how to change oil and do basic stuff on his car....it’ll save him in the future but 
9994 2018-11-16 17:29:53 Me: "I would like one of those weekly pill boxes for my fish oil -AND I GUESS THIS IS WHAT TURNING 36 LOOKS LIKE"
9995 2018-11-16 17:29:39 It’s a landrover. He can smell the diesel and oil leaking from it a mile away
9996 2018-11-16 17:29:32 That ink can be erased if you really really want to, in addition apply oil on finger before you go out to vote then the ink can be wiped off with cloth. The system only works for people who want to follow it
9997 2018-11-16 17:29:31 oil
9998 2018-11-16 17:29:26 Quantum of Solace
James Bond descends into mystery as he tries to stop a mysterious organisation from eliminating a country's most valuable  water resource.
Bond takes Dominic Greene into the desert, leaves him there, with a can of oil, & dies...
9999 2018-11-16 17:29:23 Soooo cool
10000 2018-11-16 17:29:17 The same PDP that manage the economy so well in 2008 during the global economy meltdown.

The same PDP that came into power when oil price was hovering around $20

Pls pls pls.....just support ur mediocre president, we are not all daft!
10001 2018-11-16 17:29:11 Went to get my oil changed today. They didn't get me with the "dirty air filter" but they did get me with an "oil flush" for my motor. My car isn't used to these cleanses. Next thing I know my car wants to become a vegan, join a yoga community, and do bi-weekly coffee enemas.
10002 2018-11-16 17:29:08 I really need an oil change but I guess if my car blows up, at least I work 5 minutes away from home.
10003 2018-11-16 17:29:05 Como diez 
10004 2018-11-16 17:28:49 Tomorrow's our third day on Norwich Market. Hot pie with mash & gravy is £5.50, on the menu beef & ale, chicken & ham hock or Norfolk turkey & bacon jam. Vegan option a delicious artichoke & spinach pie with cold pressed rapeseed oil pastry
10005 2018-11-16 17:28:25 Once through stream generation is very important to oil sands production. I'm very proud to attend the opening of a new OTSG lab in conjunction with University of Calgary and our corporate partners. #saitappliedresearch #sait
10006 2018-11-16 17:28:25 The central fallacy of your argument is that one doesn’t need to abstain from using the oil that powers society today in order to argue for change tomorrow. They aren’t denying they use petroleum products; we all do. They’re arguing that this fact itself is a problem
10007 2018-11-16 17:28:24 @CadburyUK I just enjoyed a Cadburys hot chocolate but I was disappointed to see that you are now using palm oil and palm fat in your products, what steps will you be taking to remove palm oil or replace it with sustainable alternatives?
10008 2018-11-16 17:28:19 Oil...
10009 2018-11-16 17:28:02 oil lows
10010 2018-11-16 17:27:59 if North America US/CAN/MEX became energy independent, and US isn't buying oil from ROW sending USD's overseas, i'd argue USD wouldn't go to 1.50 vs eur, but more like 0.80 vs EUR.  there would be a massive global dollar shortage, no?
10011 2018-11-16 17:27:40 I've always leased high end luxury vehicles and never needed to spend money on repairs or even oil changes if u finesse them right
10012 2018-11-16 17:27:38 The sin is frying the oil in your face
10013 2018-11-16 17:27:32 Just fixed the oil pressure sensor on my car engine by myself and now I feel like an adult
10014 2018-11-16 17:27:23 In fairness to them it was a palm oil container IED and the had disconnected the battery, so what was I getting all fussed about?
10015 2018-11-16 17:27:14 Castor oil e shumisa hani ?
10016 2018-11-16 17:27:08 Listened to this last night while vacationing in Greece. Very relevant to my situation. The olive oil here is great.
