19 2018-04-01 23:59:50 True, people just pick random people and give them money, they pocket all the rest. What folks should do is a megaball, 15 people enter. Choose a number, small ltc buy in. Then the winner is whatever number is drawn for the actual megaball. Not just picking random people

27 2018-04-01 23:58:36 Zach has put his neck out for all of us as a coach in the crypto space. If he didn’t do things transparently, in his position, people would say he was fake. You just do you and let him do his thing.

71 2018-03-30 23:57:23 今までのアルトコインってBTCが上昇を続けていたから対BTCペアの時にBTCに依存してたと思うんですけど、BTCの上昇が弱くなったら対ドルのチャートが強くなる気がするよ
まあ時間かかるけどそういう流れになる可能性もあるってことで
72 2018-03-30 23:57:22 So does the US dollar and Euro tho 

Also it is still a good time to invest in crypto imo. Btc has a high probability of being $100k+ in 5 years (2023) 
so you could be missing an opportunity for life changing gains not possible in any other current market. Food for thought 
73 2018-03-30 23:57:22 Thanks Mate. I would like to wait for some more time for confirmation. The Jury is still out there. dont want to jump the guns & it rallies to 20K. I feel its premature...dont want to be tinfoil-hat in the long run. you know what I am saying :)

110 2018-03-30 23:51:24 All markets have ups and downs. Did everyone sell their retirement accounts when the stock market crashed in 2008/9? NO!! So why is crypto any different now?! BUY more while you can!

112 2018-03-30 23:50:55 3/ In a booming crypto market, successful projects will have similar budgets. In a contracting/paused crypto market, success will likely come from frugality and not overspending. So again, costs measured in USD are very variable, not fixed.

118 2018-03-30 23:50:21 On here more for crypto (politics so toxic now).  One thing i disagree though is he won over middle america which is rural (farmers and such).  So not really put there by rich people as i understand it?  Elites hate him the most. (Look at Hollywood)
119 2018-03-30 23:50:12 Ok, Thank You for responding at least, it is appreciated.  I've learned to think of Richard Ells as the Jar Jar Binks of Crypto.  Even though technically to me it looks a train-wreck, ETN keeps chuggin along.

127 2018-03-30 23:48:40 I read tweet few days ago which stated "It will be better for Crypto when these weak hands get shaken out!" I thought it was a bit strong, but having witnessed some of the newbies implode, I tend to agree.
128 2018-03-30 23:48:31 Good news for criminals and terrorists, they don’t need crypto to conduct illicit operations securely.
129 2018-03-30 23:48:26 Perhaps because theyre building an ecosystem that goes beyond the trading platform. I think they have "social trading" & hybrid exchanges in the works. $XRR will be their transaction token for some of those micro/macro transactions. It's kinda how utility tokens work, no? IMO

Way too much testosterone in crypto.
148 2018-03-30 23:45:55 I think it’s a great idea to give government officials the power to decrypt everything.

157 2018-03-30 23:44:48 Thanks my friend, much appreciated!
158 2018-03-30 23:44:38 On the other side closing below 5873 in 3 successive daily candles = complete meltdown of crypto markets. Expect cascading effects. My brother @chrisL23406329 will update you more on what happens if that happens
159 2018-03-30 23:44:35 Assuming it connects to an exchange via an API and you can see everything it's doing then it might be worth researching further. Not really sure why a token is necessary for such a service however. Why not just straight up charge $BTC like some of the signaling services?

167 2018-03-30 23:43:27 IMO, Crypto just needs more mainstream marketing like Wells Fargo’s new Zelle Pay or I don’t think it’s going to gain enough traction to actually go mainstream. At least 5-10% of worlds population will have to demand it.

171 2018-03-30 23:42:37 Question to all my crypto followers that think the market cap is important. If a token is 1$ and stay at 1$ for two years while still getting mined, Is it bullish or bearish that token ?
172 2018-03-30 23:42:35 I bought #eth for under 400.... What year is it?
173 2018-03-30 23:42:24 I can understand your skepticism. Unfortunately you're unwilling to research further.

This however doesn't "tell you you're making profit" you see the actual result on the exchanges you're trading on. The board shows u an analysis of coins and a report of your opened positions
174 2018-03-30 23:42:21 I like to post shill news to counter all the FUD news that market makers like the spread to manipulate the market. “Guilty!”
175 2018-03-30 23:42:20 I’m embarrassed I know what this is. I am also embarrassed I also am rekt. Considering making a new animated show called Coleslaw Toes.
176 2018-03-30 23:42:02 Azor came up with a new crypto currency called “Justice.” Nobody mines it, but he tells everyone about it.

192 2018-03-30 23:40:08 Thoughts on institutional $$ coming in to save #cryptocurrency. 1) large investors represent appealing targets for malevolent state actors, 2) custodians may be licensed but are they trusted, 3) volatility is organic to crypto, will whales really invest and stomach +/- 30% swings

201 2018-03-30 23:39:04 For realz: the #crypto crash is simple. 1st Mt Gox or whatever hits and a dip happens. 

You & me, we believe in a few coins. The market dips, we buy. Dip hits again, we buy again. 

Soon we want to keep buying but we’re out of gaddamn fiat. Then what? Who buys now?

206 2018-03-30 23:38:14 Admittedly I haven't researched this as yet (probably won't tbh) but what I've seen before is systems that claim you are making money from traders (automated, or "trained" individuals) when in truth it's just a ponzi scheme.
207 2018-03-30 23:38:07 LOL the point of a market making and arbitrage platform is that it makes money in any market. Only in crypto do people criticize one of the few companies whom actually have a tangible product, and the critique is for having launched.

225 2018-03-30 23:35:16 Easiest way to make money in crypto is buy the dip. Easiest way to spot the dip, is when the whole market dips.
226 2018-03-30 23:35:09 Had this one where I was up hyuuge in this bizarre “crypto currency” market like it was literally buying internet coins that for some reason people valued even though there was nothing tangible to actually base value off of. Then I woke up broke

230 2018-03-30 23:34:45 More so the Coin Monitoring Board (CMB) has been around for a while (a protracted beta if you may). This is like the bedrock on which many other things are connected, especially the automation for those who want automation
231 2018-03-30 23:34:39 
232 2018-03-30 23:34:35 crypto moves much faster on that chart than traditional stocks do. Could easily be in the depression stage
233 2018-03-30 23:34:26 Marius, I get the distinct feeling that much of the crypto market is under mob mentality and syndicates that are very powerful can control an unregulated marketplace.  Both the good and bad about this market I’m afraid.

Put it all into $ACT, moved to KCash wallet and set up ACT loyalty program. It's bull time. #crypto

301 2018-03-30 23:27:55 I sincerely hope you're right. I still think it's a possibility crypto becomes pretty much worthless. Hope I'm wrong
302 2018-03-30 23:27:49 serious question, is crypto dead? I'm not gonna take my money out, i'v already considered what I put in a loss, but i'm tryna find out.
303 2018-03-30 23:27:44 The problem is that you don't actually KNOW that it's coming from trading success. I've seen these sort of things before over the last four years, and inevitably they prove to be glorified ponzi schemes. Not worth the risk in my opinion.

Attention and personal data are now the most
important commodities on the internet.
Media, both serves as an effective place to
create an attention/data economy and is
primed for blockchain disruption
306 2018-03-30 23:27:22 This made it all so worth it.
307 2018-03-30 23:27:21 Yesh.. I think "no loss" sounds like a hyperbole. But based on what I have seen so far it carefully selects coins based on price relativity and "suitability index" so it doesn't just enter positions based on hype but based on algorithms

331 2018-03-30 23:24:55 Tbh though, I've seen the prototype at work and have seen it scalp profits even in the recent days - using the "augmented interesting" to assume entry and exit points of selected coins that is.

I imagine a robot definitely does it better if I'm willing to trust it.
332 2018-03-30 23:24:45 Gotcha. Only so much fits into a tweet/image :-). I’ll just HODL mine. Kinda torn on whether i should get another X Node higher on VEN though. The rewards are $$$

363 2018-03-30 23:21:19 This should provide competition for private trading firms, I don't think it will replace them since every platform/firm is only as good as their strategy, so it still leaves the possibility for some firms to outperform or at least break even with these kinds of platforms

446 2018-03-30 23:12:35 So when I say “you need to have a plan to verify client implementations as part of your crypto backdoor solution” and you brush it off, that tells me you haven’t thought deeply about the problem.

And this is just one small problem to solve out of many.
447 2018-03-30 23:12:29 Been way to deep in the crypto rabbit hole. Its good to have this vacation to force me to unplug and enjoy life outside crypto.
448 2018-03-30 23:12:25 I so love crypto and what it is doing to the banking industry. 
It may take a few years to become mainstream. 
But it will happen.

That being said, time for another one of Socal's Quick n Dirty ICO Reviews!
456 2018-03-30 23:11:20 ... until they think of a way to tax it or set up their own crypto coin. But seriously, most people aren't even aware of Kazakhstan's existence, so no one cares.
457 2018-03-30 23:11:04 Valuation will be determined by the open market - not by any one person - and in the long term only - as the rest of the crypto + blockchain + decentralization value story actually happens ... NEWS is a long term story - starting with @NextElections
458 2018-03-30 23:10:56 sure it's a bear market but the total crypto market Cap 10x from where it was exactly one year ago today, it's a strange kind of bear. Maybe peoples expectation are a bit out of whack.

467 2018-03-30 23:10:01 Tl;dr no one knows. Crypto is unlike any market we’ve seen. My guess is it’s a combination of whales, news, and irrational trading but anyone who says they know what’s going on is either a fool or lying.

485 2018-03-30 23:07:29 I've come to trade with you again
Because a cartel softly creeping
Left its manipulation while I was sleeping
And the fear that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of crypto people's silence

487 2018-03-30 23:07:11 Complacency. Why would big money stop manipulation here? Crypto is no different than any other investment in life. The rich get richer the poor get poorer. The dec/jan rally was just to drag the normies in. This isn't the bottom.
488 2018-03-30 23:06:56 Hey @MailChimp are you guys going to block my emails about crypto currencies? It would be good to know so I can cancel any of my accounts and all of my customer accounts. Thanks!

547 2018-03-30 22:59:49 Market manipulation by the whale cartel is crashing the market so that institutional money can swoop in and buy an epic amount of crypto for dirt cheap.

592 2018-03-30 22:54:51 I'm not even sure if it's worth the effort anymore to warn people that we most likely have not hit bottom yet in #crypto, don't bet against the trend!
593 2018-03-30 22:54:50 We’re just in the first speculative phase of crypto
594 2018-03-30 22:54:42 Eh I think you’re overreacting, but I’m not active in their community like you are. Every project has cult-like tendencies (and also we’ve seen that the coins with the strongest cults get the biggest pumps)

597 2018-03-30 22:54:38 My goal is to be the last guy holding all the BTC...so keep panic selling so I can afford it! Please and thank you! $crypto
598 2018-03-30 22:54:26 Pourquoi ne pas reconnaître simplement qu’il existe des raclures type Poussier et autres crypto-antisémite au sein de la FI ???

600 2018-03-30 22:54:21 It really fucks me off when I see some cunts friday follows doesn’t include me, even if I don’t know said cunt. Needless to say, I am furious right now.
601 2018-03-30 22:54:07 Checked it out. No hoodies with Litecoin logo as far as I can see. But I ordered the hat (and paid with crypto of course lol)! 
602 2018-03-30 22:54:00 Traditional advice was 5% of net worth into crypto. And something to the tune of at least 40% into BTC.  Twitter makes it seem like people went much harder into corns.

612 2018-03-30 22:52:04 Getting fiat into crypto in Australia is like riding cross country on a fucking steam train! Of course when you finally arrive, you get to ride a supersonic jet. #bpay you are so slow and so pointless. I can wait for your demise
613 2018-03-30 22:51:52 Not saying it wont drop further, but it probably wont be due to the new entrants which caused the correlation between searches of 'BTC' and upward price movement.
614 2018-03-30 22:51:50 That was mean of them 
615 2018-03-30 22:51:49 Crypto currency's bubble will burst like the dot com crash in exactly three years
616 2018-03-30 22:51:44 Agree. I haven't heard from a single Bitcoin 2013 guru that it might be a good idea to take profits at 19K because you never know. No, they were raving about $100k, preaching HODL and posting elaborate anti selling/ anti altcoins memes. Now Bitcoin looks like altcoin itself. :/
617 2018-03-30 22:51:35 Ni bitcoin ni ninguna otra red está ni cerca de poder procesar la cantidad de TX/sec de una hipotética economía global en crypto. Y por eso existe el debate de escalabilidad on-chain con bloques más grandes o off-chain con segundas capas (lighting network).
618 2018-03-30 22:51:04 Haha, Im sorry for you Crypto Bobby. A lot of tention in the market.  we are getting closer to anger and depression....a good sign actually
619 2018-03-30 22:51:02 The only regret I would add to the winner's 42 sec post is... they're crayfish and not lobster cos they don't have any big claws. So technically, I have the winning answer ;)
620 2018-03-30 22:50:58 Btc down today, yet plenty of alts holding their own. This could be a good sign.

626 2018-03-30 22:50:32 
627 2018-03-30 22:50:28 I don't trade crypto (I own 5 MANA, and the Mana is for me say "i always have 5 mana open!" and 50 DOGE), and I watch the charts and subs because they are GOLD.
628 2018-03-30 22:50:21 As search volume increases, there is an increase in new entrants buying BTC. But when search volume drops, while some people would be selling out, I think a lot of people will either 'HODL' or even try to buy the dip. The correlation should be less on the way down. thoughts?
629 2018-03-30 22:50:19 I respect it! Good Shit

660 2018-03-30 22:46:31 Can confirm
661 2018-03-30 22:46:28 If I say to you that verifying device implementations is an aspect of critical importance beyond the crypto, and you brush that aside, then I’m entitled to explain to you WHY it’s so important. 

The fact that you are pretending not to understand doesn’t make you more credible.
662 2018-03-30 22:46:27 Not too much to say on the current situation.

$BTC looking for a bottom but alts seem okay. Pretty much just watching and waiting.

691 2018-03-30 22:42:35 Your proposal is to use public key crypto to build “cryptographic envelopes”. I asked who would verify the device implementations to verify those keys were correct, and gave an *actual* example where nation-state attackers replaced similar keys by hacking a codebase.

746 2018-03-30 22:34:00 I’ll definitely go on a crypto mission once I got back home in about few weeks. 
747 2018-03-30 22:33:59 It's bearish because a lot of people thought crypto would change the world RIGHT F-- NOW!! Then they gave up and lost faith after waiting 4 whole weeks. But... now when #SUB and others actually publish during 2018 the sheep will all flock back :) PS: I'm in Tether, soon SUB! :P

756 2018-03-30 22:32:03 So you said shit takes time right? So what you’re saying is the market is constipated and we should give it some sort of a bitcoin probiotic or some laxatives?

760 2018-03-30 22:31:41 Why so few happy/sad hours? I think people like to chat even when the market is bloody. I was looking back at early December and you had a 3 hour long happy hour. Dem were the days.
761 2018-03-30 22:31:34 Sometimes I wonder if crypto investors in Asia say, "this is going to take off when the North Americans wake up"

764 2018-03-30 22:31:08 In bear markets turn to solid PoW coins and master nodes you’ll be a lot safer than all the pump and dump madness
765 2018-03-30 22:30:57 My most used saying for crypto now is "We will see." Itll go up, or down, or sideways, but we will just have to wait and see.
766 2018-03-30 22:30:51 Uh-maaazing

768 2018-03-30 22:30:15 Woocommerce is only used for very small business, Magento, Lightspeed and the few big payment providers out there need to support this. payment providers deliver easy administration, it will be hell to do this yourself with crypto payment being such volatile.

770 2018-03-30 22:30:06 Great article that is likely more truth than not. I think it can be summarized that the futures market created a group of traders (shorts), who have a vested interest in the price of BTC falling. Something that had not previously existed.

780 2018-03-30 22:28:59 Crypto is officially in a bear market. Currently working on moving my trading strategies in a bearish direction.
781 2018-03-30 22:28:55 True that   

Cc: @crypto_rand
782 2018-03-30 22:28:52 But not to recognise the top of the cycle and beginning of the fall is plain incompetence (especially if one is experienced - buying Bitcoin from $3). To be aware but keeping quiet about possible losses whilst encouraging others to HODL (because BTC is "special") is harmful.
783 2018-03-30 22:28:51 Everyone seems smarts in mega bulltrends, crypto traders don't know how to short sell a market? #NotRealTraders
784 2018-03-30 22:28:51 
785 2018-03-30 22:28:46 Probably going to be staying away from any coins that raise anymore than 50 million USD in a presale also looking strictly on ones that are utility tokens and verified and compliant with SEC regulations. Will set more focus on POW coins like $RVN
786 2018-03-30 22:28:45 Crypto was great before countries got their damn governments involved
787 2018-03-30 22:28:42 Does sitting between two men in a truck count as "skiing"?
788 2018-03-30 22:28:37 Also, entries matter for all. Even if perma holding from highs could make you money eventually, taking profit/hedging on big rises and other simple strategies can multiply many times what your money will be worth then

810 2018-03-30 22:25:32 I think the assumption is that it can get pretty close to resistance levels, and you can increase stop loss at any time, but he's implying SL from the get go, as a starter. People new to trading may not really have an idea of where to start their SL

818 2018-03-30 22:24:31 1/ Fun tax scenario that might explain crypto sell-off leading into tax day:
June 2017: new person enters crypto, buys 5 BTC at $2500
Nov 2017: up 400%, starts trading alt-coins with 2btc, puts other 3 into cold storage.
819 2018-03-30 22:24:30 Been thinking and Crypto as a concept is hideous.  Every miner spends a shit ton of money on hardware which they then waste on using it to burn a shit ton of fossil fuels for no purpose other than obtaining a token which allows them to fleece money off of another person.

821 2018-03-30 22:24:25 $TRX For those of you saying “5 hrs left”, look at the Tronix website. About 16 hr 36 min from now. Or 8am PST. Or 11am EST. Or 4pm GMT.
822 2018-03-30 22:24:24 Most of crypto traders pretend they crush #Bitcoin market “bc they’ve been here since 2016” or “they traded bitcoin since $300”. 

The real question is : were they here during 2014 $BTC bear market ?

If not, there’s a good chance they just know as much about trading as you do.
823 2018-03-30 22:23:58 The new Bitcoin is EBTC.
824 2018-03-30 22:23:56 Most of it is actually pretty horrible, but we only hear about the not terrible end-to-end crypto because they cause much more damage. Good ransomware crypto would actually be evidence that the bad guys can write their own crypto and avoid the backdoored systems.
825 2018-03-30 22:23:50 Argh.. don't jinx it..
826 2018-03-30 22:23:46 Until they are removed...
827 2018-03-30 22:23:31 What are you guys doing about taxes if you live in the US? Are you using crypto tax software, approximating numbers manually, only counting crypto-fiat conversions? Assuming you've made enough for the IRS to care.
828 2018-03-30 22:23:28 Why have you not paid our payouts for 2 days? Oh wait your Fee's are more than we are earning.

830 2018-03-30 22:23:00 Data scientists interested in crypto  get in touch with @avichal who is working on something in the space.
831 2018-03-30 22:22:46 Having said that, I don’t hold Monaro,  I don’t understand it, and it’s probably sketchy as....   anyone relying on crypto currently to facilitate their private vice is probably going regret it in the future.

836 2018-03-30 22:22:06 That is a fact that you can't be sure of. Although it could be likely, it isn't a certainty. Regardless of being a trader or long term investor, risk management is a good thing, certainties are not.

849 2018-03-30 22:20:48 a priory a device can not be safe if it has a law enforcement backdoor, because then the crypto is not safe against law enforcement, it doesn't really matter if it's exploited or not.

851 2018-03-30 22:20:39 I would say never sell. Bitcoin is the future of the economy. Selling is for weak hands.
852 2018-03-30 22:20:12 Every crypto class should have a project to fix a broken crypto implementation in a way that can be deployed without breaking active customer implementations.  And teach lesson #1: sniff the wire and look for plaintext before shipping.
853 2018-03-30 22:20:03 Why do you care? I’ve never heard of the ico journal. Probably neither has half of the crypto world
854 2018-03-30 22:20:03 It's not just "holding through the dip", it's never selling, hodling forever, not taking any profit, not using risk management, perma bulls. All of which are being humbled by the market. Perma bears will also bleed again eventually. Ppl who claim certainties are not good.

881 2018-03-30 22:17:32 The Fed would like us to liquidate into USD but that would be a mistake rn
882 2018-03-30 22:17:25 The same centralised governments that will be shortly be making the decisions to fight crypto or roll over.  Why let them have this choice?  Fund privacy related innovation.
883 2018-03-30 22:17:23 I don’t agree at all that encouraging people to hold through the dip makes you a bad actor

890 2018-03-30 22:16:40 I agree to an extent. Everyone is responsible for their own actions / trades, but that doesn't make these bad actors any less bad.
891 2018-03-30 22:16:38 I guess so long as crypto has volatility I don’t need to buy the absolute bottom. I’ll just ride the latter waves trying to accumulate coins. Thanks for words of wisdom

895 2018-03-30 22:15:44 A 21.5% loss is more than most would tolerate. That’s why I presumed there is no way he meant that. I’m HODL on ADA anyway, but I could see how many (like your fave NANO) could be an easy gain now.Yet, with a 5% SL, not 21.5%. Why not just keep moving the SL up or stop out cheap?

934 2018-03-30 22:11:06 SL below your entry point as a worst case scenario. The entry of 14, with resistance of 21 means take profit any time between. If you set stop loss above 14, say at 16, you sell at 16 and won't get any higher. Stop is below entry for that reason.
935 2018-03-30 22:10:33 Xrp is not a crypto why? It's cryptographically secure, it's decentralized, it can't be double spent, the ledger is open. If you know the first thing about cryptocurrency, XRP fits that description to the tee

946 2018-03-30 22:09:59 ...they also haven't been socialized to the extent of our generation because they can engage in hateful bitter confrontations online or on social media without having to deal with real world consequences.  they are immature in the process of developing healthy social contracts
947 2018-03-30 22:09:57 Honestly, lobster was my guess as well. Dunno why, fynny eh. 
948 2018-03-30 22:09:33 11/n In that world, you end up with many miners / forgers / etc. (prob specialised and segmented by type of consensus algorithm) providing compute services to maintain many protocols in exchange for transaction/usage fees paid in fiat and/or a dominant non-sov monetary SoV crypto
949 2018-03-30 22:09:19 Would you defend @CNN if they'd done a segment mocking Hillary Clintons hair style, or Michelle Obama's outfit? What if they mocked President Obama's weight and his penchant for cigarettes? 
950 2018-03-30 22:09:18 Oh man please? Are you serious. You’re making a fool of yourself. Take a look at ripple and rethink. And please the market cap will grow. If it will reach 3t or maybe 4t or even 7t in let’s say 2 years, then Tron won’t reach 50 cents?! Come on. Get your hands off from crypto

958 2018-03-30 22:08:45 or are they just really well indoctrinated by entertainment, media, press, and marxist anti-capitalist teachers... ignoring the history of the communists and other totalitarian philosophies.  have the been trained to not believe in the principles that our country was founded on?

960 2018-03-30 22:08:42 if stablecoins worked (lol?) and/or if crypto prices were stable (lol), I think an incredibly useful application for smart contracts would be company expense / petty cash management  (inb4 "DAO. You've invented a DAO")

962 2018-03-30 22:08:35 It's not about suriving this dip lol, smart money is not flowing into crypto anymore. The only reasons price fly is because of Whales and they only care about money. How can crypto be relevant again doesn't strike me

Just like when i exited btc at 8.1 saying I fear what is about to happen. I saw tremors. Plus what goes up this high must correct itself
966 2018-03-30 22:08:10 So you saying.. investing with new cash in this low (Crypto market) is a bad choice / bad practice?

983 2018-03-30 22:06:14 from a 100-yr view, the 21st century brought the digitization of physical things leading to a more fluid, fine-grained relationship to said things; the current excitement around crypto is beginning of this process as it applies to _sovereignty_.
984 2018-03-30 22:06:01 Factually incorrect. Many coins rallied after bitcoin started crashing. $ETH for example rallied a full 100% after bitcoin started crashing. You should have said "NOT A SINGLE ONE has rallied since the SEC concerns started dominating the crypto narrative".
985 2018-03-30 22:05:55 My pleasure. Hope it helps!
986 2018-03-30 22:05:49 Your straw man skills are on point. Nowhere in this thread did I see @DJThistle01 ask for pity. What I did see him ask for is consistency from @CNN when they pick and choose what's headline news. Seems normal nowadays, if you have a dissenting opinion you get shouted down.

Silver is a denomination because of abundance this makes 0 sense in a crypto world. If bitcoin adopts 100% privacy as Monero I will sell every alt coin for BTC

1013 2018-03-30 22:02:05 The future state of the crypto market determines, in part, the future costs of a project competing in the crypto market. The unknown future costs are not simply set in USD. That's a simplistic view that looks at costs solely in terms of development of a specific static goal set.

1018 2018-03-30 22:01:31 Was that created specifically because of the intense bull markets of 2017? Because otherwise, I can see lots of rekt and personal insolvency if ppl generate taxable events over and over in a bull market and stay in crypto just to lose it all in the next bear season.

Here, nobody cares (yet) as long as you still own your crypto. But once you sell for Fiat money, you generate a taxable event.

Money token has quite a high supply however the current Token price is 0.01, the guaranteed retail value is 0.10 for ico participants per the white paper, already has a working product if you want a loan to buy crypto..
1137 2018-03-30 21:51:50 Do you see POWR diping more?
1138 2018-03-30 21:51:49 Correct. Fools. However, that doesn’t mean #bitcoin isn’t working. Far more people care about the inflation of their money supply than 10 years ago.

It’s working, but education is the only delay.

1154 2018-03-30 21:50:29 Playing or just suck?
1155 2018-03-30 21:50:28 Bitcoin is only crypto asset that has futures derivatives selling on CBOE and CME, ETFs are also coming soon, that will all enable billions of fiat to come in and institutional investors to participate, so it's the only cryptocurrency that is lack of better words trustable

1182 2018-03-30 21:47:22 #Crypto #Blockchain #Crowdfunding #JoyToken Supported wallets for  the  Token Sale include MyEtherWallet, Mist-Ethereum Wallet, Metamask,   Parity, imToken, Ledger, Trezor, and others. You cannot use an exchange  such as Bitstamp and Bittrex which manages your keys.
1183 2018-03-30 21:47:20 2/ To the extent they are not really crypto projects competing in the crypto space and just using crypto for fundraising (for example, mostly a cloud computing platform having little to do with crypto) then the "costs in USD" argument may be closer to correct.
1184 2018-03-30 21:47:19 Yeah, that’s wrong. The madonna/whore dichotomy has been around for centuries and I studied it in college, before Dan Brown was publishing pseudo, crypto-historical thrillers. There’s even a segment of semiotics that studied how the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene are repped.
1185 2018-03-30 21:47:06 Your are both lovely.
1186 2018-03-30 21:46:59 lol I'm in a short right now just waiting for this half assed attempt at a wave to come down... I'm sure it'll inevitably go $5 over my stop then straight down

1189 2018-03-30 21:46:26 #HODLers #XRP Probably the best tweet that I have ever seen in the crypto side of Twitter.
1190 2018-03-30 21:46:25 1/ What you're missing is that these are mostly crypto-market projects. Their costs (undetermined future marketing and development costs, and competitive positioning) are not just "in USD", as the future state of the crypto market matters a lot.
1191 2018-03-30 21:46:24 There’s a corner store by our hotel that sells #BitCoin. You can buy your snacks, mixers, and crypto currency .
1192 2018-03-30 21:46:23 #Current is one of the most interesting and promising projects. In the near future we will see the revolution in the world of crypto currency and #Current  will be the main player in this market!
1193 2018-03-30 21:46:16 Sitting in Ukraine and thinking: could bitcoin help to re-establish the trust between a government and the population? Transactions made by the government would be public and everyone could check what taxes are spend for. #btc #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency #politics

1212 2018-03-30 21:43:55 In several years looking at industrial crypto I’ve learned that when people say “getting law enforcement backdoors working safely at scale will be hard”, they’re not kidding. I can say this because many existing devices barely get encryption right.
1213 2018-03-30 21:43:51 So, if this has been ongoing for 6 years, why is the director of finance who's only been in his job for a couple of years (significantly less than 6) taking the fall? Interesting indeed....

1231 2018-03-30 21:42:10 Reason hasn't been adopted and hit 1M is most people do not care about neither privacy nor governments yielding too much power. The average person sadly has no use for bitcoin. And the majority of those who bought into crypto did so strictly to speculate.

1332 2018-03-30 21:27:25 I feel this has some truth to it... Except once everyone comes to the realization that Crypto (BTC) is our future there will be more then just BTC.. A beatuiful crypto economy with many use cases, as well as world wide corporations issuing Blockchain tech to track there own asset

1344 2018-03-30 21:26:10 Anyone want to take bets on whether googles trending stats on crypto is auto correlated or a true variable?  My bet is we will look back in 3-5 years and say that’s the new “eyeballs” indicator.
1345 2018-03-30 21:26:09 Thank you for sharing your crypto knowledge.
1346 2018-03-30 21:26:04 Thinking about that $eth  lucky I still need to fill my alt bags
1347 2018-03-30 21:26:04 When bcash was .5/btc it was the biggest scam in town. To date, I think Ripple is the biggest scam in that the majority of its holders still actually believe it's a crypto-currency and not a glorified IOU service. When Dash launched with its instanmine, it was biggest. ScamTiming
1348 2018-03-30 21:26:01 You're confused because he doesn't know shit about Crypto. He is literally a fraud that saw the bitcoin craze and a chance to con people into thinking he is some sort of TA crypto guru so he can sell them bullshit reports. Welcome to the real world. DYOR on him, he's a scam.

1379 2018-03-30 21:23:00 If you're not having fun, you probably shouldn't be trading crypto. Or at least reduce the amount you're trading.
1380 2018-03-30 21:22:55 #btc #bitcoin #crypto The thing I will never understand is this. Why Bitcoiners attribute such passionate opinions to Bitcoin as it relates to Fiat Price. If its success could only be measured by adoption, would any of them care about it as much?
1381 2018-03-30 21:22:44 How about the residents who volunteered, financed and voted for someone to represent their interests only to be sold out in a matter of weeks? Vesey resoundingly rejected the Conservatives, I'm sure they didn't deserve to have a crypto-Tory foist on them.

1390 2018-03-30 21:21:09 Ether $366, that sort of feels like bottom. I really have no idea how much faith people put in the tech. If drops box gets a couple billion, then so does some of these code-piles. Everything in #crypto is more secure than everything not in crytpto. Security is somewhat priceless.
1391 2018-03-30 21:21:04 I’m correcting my guess and saying $.58 by 2019
1392 2018-03-30 21:21:00 Use it to fund an account to leverage trade stocks, currency pairs, idicies, etc. would then invest in crypto for long term holdings before the summer bull run. Lastly, I would use it to work on promotion and advertising for my clothing brand.

1454 2018-03-30 21:14:01 The answer is in the statement: The ‘traditional’ financial sector has got into it.

1458 2018-03-30 21:13:24 I would invest it $ONT the one coin you can rely on for quick gains during this bear market and when bull market comes  love this solid project I predict will be bigger than NEO
1459 2018-03-30 21:13:15 The # of posts you make daily showing all sorts of monkey projections with a magic bull run for Alts does give an impression that all you care about is upvotes from steemit and raking money from it. Quite unethical and dishonest attitude really if that's the case.
1460 2018-03-30 21:13:07 Ramen with pieces of my own di*k , this is what i can afford now
1461 2018-03-30 21:13:03 Monero isn’t the only coin to mine with crypto night algo
1462 2018-03-30 21:12:59 Whoah...watch out crypto trading world!!
1463 2018-03-30 21:12:39 In spite of the various strategies and practices I’ve learned and adopted since entering the crypto-sphere, nothing has proven to be anywhere near as fruitful for me as this dip. This from a somewhat competent Noob-Demi-Bull.

1468 2018-03-30 21:11:57 why do you say that?
1469 2018-03-30 21:11:38 I know people strive to find the #crypto project with the largest set of features to invest in: privacy, smart contracts, fast transactions are some of those. I want to point out that #IoTeX not only got tons of great features, but it also proposes innovations for each of them!

1474 2018-03-30 21:11:17 I want one too....
1475 2018-03-30 21:11:08 I'm sorry but I dont like crypto.

1. They are stealing gpu's from regular people. Causing crazy prices

2. There are to many currencies.

3. Its taxed in ny.

4. People act like it's the next stock market, and a great place to put your entire life savings.

 When it's not.
1476 2018-03-30 21:11:08 Thanks to all my followers who are still believing in #crypto, in midst of all this market drama. To be clear, I'm a hardcore Hodler, 90% of my portfolio is in #Bitcoin, and 2 other coins. I only trade 10% in all other altcoins and try to grow it, to get more $BTC, bear or bull.

1488 2018-03-30 21:09:08 There are actually a ton of them. The majority have been around Bitcoin for awhile so they are use to all the negativity about how "your crypto is worthless." Silently taking over what really makes Bitcoin special. A cash system.
1489 2018-03-30 21:08:52 missed out on the storm call, aint no way im missing this.
1490 2018-03-30 21:08:46 Im only buying more every day as i get more cash to buy the next dip!

1493 2018-03-30 21:08:23 1/ Master Haejin, I think you should go and lie down a bit and get some rest. All these days you have been posting a biased bullish projection. Now all of a sudden you figured out a bearish one. Also last 6 weeks you have been posting a break out for all sorts of alts coins.
1494 2018-03-30 21:08:18 Lol it s a running gag hope you didn t bet on your past prediction
1495 2018-03-30 21:08:15 but what hurdles do the nep-5 tokens have now ? They are all mostly on good exchanges and DEX is something yet to fully establish and makes its mark on the ERC-20 side..

1508 2018-03-30 21:07:03 hows about LA unified is one of the most highly funded and doing the poorest.  So to understand you correctly are you saying money is the source of good education?  and also if the school is well funded but with poor teachers and crappy curriculum teaching marxism why fund it?
1509 2018-03-30 21:06:53 I’m really tossing this one up

1514 2018-03-30 21:06:23 Btw... it's treasonous at this point to not listen to #cryptobangerz
1515 2018-03-30 21:06:18 I thought about that but it seemed like too much, so made it a smaller amount to be a harder choice lol
1516 2018-03-30 21:06:15 Let them keep spending their advances on jewelry and rentals and other depreciating items. I’ll take my advance in all crypto! Matter fact if you’re thinking about getting me a “chain” to wear it better be a BLOCKCHAIN! New School New Money
1517 2018-03-30 21:06:04 Do it up. I'll give you a follow and a vote. Are you supercrypto?

1523 2018-03-30 21:05:56 Since crypto Twitter is so bearish on crypto, it might be time for it to finally pump!

1525 2018-03-30 21:05:23 I was going over the DAAs yesterday while Bitcoin was tanking. @ransbottyn's TRADE (some -9%/24H) seemed most promising, but I still didn't buy as it held a lot of ETH. Would it be possible to create a safe haven DAA partially outside the crypto sphere, with, like, USD, gold?
1526 2018-03-30 21:05:17 Be careful with catching falling knifes right now guys, I think we still have more downtrend coming. 

Be careful trying to find the bottom. 

Always be adapting to current market conditions.

1529 2018-03-30 21:04:59 Crypto currency is an electronic currency that is worth a crap ton.... Bitcoin is a perfect example as a bitcoin was worth 5k at a moment
1530 2018-03-30 21:04:58 Remember the whole point of crypto was to bypass the bankers to avoid their cut . The reality is crypto doesn’t do that it’s BLOCKCHAIN and its ledger system that perform that function. BTW it was reported that the Bitcoin founder sold out in December 2017..Hmm
1531 2018-03-30 21:04:56 Great response Omar.... $DASH vs $ETH is a no brainer ....
1532 2018-03-30 21:04:55 I reckon that if this trendline does not hold you will find a lower one to use.

1547 2018-03-30 21:03:28 I'm learning to do the opposite of what the majority does. When people think crypto is dying, thats when you jump in. When crypto is exuberant, that's when you scale out.
1548 2018-03-30 21:03:15 Glossy websites do not a good company make. Beware #crypto startups that withhold basic info in the hiring process. Diligence thoroughly. Heard an ugly story today.
1549 2018-03-30 21:03:15 Lol all good. Soon enough we'll get that pairing and life will be better for Altcoin holders lol

1563 2018-03-30 21:01:46 uhm, no one said Bitcoin was not successful in any way. It was successful at introducing us to the Blockchain and crypto, but now it's rekt from futures market. It also succeeding in bringing us many alts; actually that is a failure of  BTC :)

1586 2018-03-30 20:59:59 I'm in man! Let's get it scheduled, should be a ton of fun
1587 2018-03-30 20:59:52 Ha ha that’s why you should stay away from crypto. You think this is a dump? Sadly mistaken my friend. The market on a whole had been in a bear market. It’s called a downward trend. Go cry scam some more you cry baby waaa waaaaaa  
1588 2018-03-30 20:59:42 Charlie, can my cousin and me hang out?
1589 2018-03-30 20:59:40 @JaajoLinnonmaa pidä vielä kiinni hetki BTCstä... Heinäkuun loppu-elokuun puoliväli kattele uudelleen.. Btw, zekkaa riple.. Melko varmaan tippuu vielä hetken, mutta kun BTC pohjalla(kaikki crypto seuraa BTC), jos BTC ei nouse, ripple alkaa elää omaa elämäänsä ja nousee (google)
1590 2018-03-30 20:59:39 I think the quinlann & associates report will be pretty accurate. Total mcap of all crypto will be below 230 billion by end of the year. So bitcoin will be maybe 3k. Then slow recovery to 400 billion for all crypto by 2020
1591 2018-03-30 20:59:36 I think that is where I started wrong. I should have done it in steem. I have an account there..I need to copy it there.
1592 2018-03-30 20:59:33 Here’s a million ways to make coin. Thousands of coins, buying, shorting, margin, fiat, USDT etc etc etc #crypto #hodlthis
1593 2018-03-30 20:59:19 Thanks for your effort and willingness to share as much info as possible. Seeing your chart confirms mine, I've drew the same patterns on my chart and for a newbie means a lot.
1594 2018-03-30 20:59:12 起きて7200超えたりしてたらBTCさん少しだけ見直す
1595 2018-03-30 20:59:00 Well, I've always got a lot more to learn over the long-term. And I'm a huge fan of your content. We should definitely do a video together in the near future.
1596 2018-03-30 20:58:52 Clearly articulating a difficult concept technology, or theme has become crucially important in today's world think crypto, AI, VR, Genomics, etc.) #Feynman
Does that mean journos with enviable writing, structuring, and messaging skills can exponentially grow/expand their roles?
1597 2018-03-30 20:58:52 I wasn’t going to say it...
1598 2018-03-30 20:58:49 High wasted style is gross
1599 2018-03-30 20:58:38 I will but I have a feeling it will get me depressed!
1600 2018-03-30 20:58:38 Love it 
1601 2018-03-30 20:58:36 What's crypto? And don't Ginx it
1602 2018-03-30 20:58:34 Did $trx run out of steam? 
Will $fun still moon?
$xlm testnet in some days? 
Crypto still alive
1603 2018-03-30 20:58:32 nothing, no idea why this idiot has done this.
1604 2018-03-30 20:58:31 You too. Have a fantastic weekend ! Cheers
1605 2018-03-30 20:58:28 The month where every fifa youtuber became Crypto experts
1606 2018-03-30 20:58:07 @JoelKatz may be satoshi, but its definitely not @ProfFaustus
1607 2018-03-30 20:57:57 you too
1608 2018-03-30 20:57:55 So funny bro
1609 2018-03-30 20:57:55 can someone tell me what crypto means so i can understand the tweet
1610 2018-03-30 20:57:54 En lo que falla incuestionablemente #Bitcoin, o cualquier otra #crypto, es en el valor. La característica que debe tener cualquier moneda es tener un costo de emisión más elevado que su valor de mercado. La creación de dinero no produce riqueza.

1616 2018-03-30 20:57:25 Full maturation would be regulation and banking.  Sorry, fiat will never go away.   I ran money for some very large HFs and they could never invest in crypto from a fiduciary basis.   Hacked exchanges and exchanges without legit means of moving fiat is not institutional.
1617 2018-03-30 20:57:24 Did you make huge profits from crypto in 2017 and lost most of it hodlin over the peak?

1624 2018-03-30 20:56:50 I enjoy the lack of crypto talk on twitter these days.
1625 2018-03-30 20:56:48 @canadian_crypto I'm always looking for investment advice
1626 2018-03-30 20:56:29 We have 5 spots left at the sale price... read the tweet

1631 2018-03-30 20:56:14 TimeBox has been quickly becoming popular in the ICO ratings, this omly means that TimeBox will likely to hit the pinnacle of success in crypto world. #BTC #ETH #Timebox
1632 2018-03-30 20:55:54 All crypto currencies are recovering now. Prices are jumping up. If you got to purchase some during the dip, you should pat yourself on the back.

1633 2018-03-30 20:55:44 Likewise! Happy friday/trading brother!
1634 2018-03-30 20:55:31 @swoboman87 specific to crypto, I am bullish on the idea and especially blockchain. Although I don't know who wins out.
1635 2018-03-30 20:55:25 Wats ur take on crypto currency and ICO .... after Blockchain
1636 2018-03-30 20:55:09 WOW!  unbelievable so many still asleep!!
1637 2018-03-30 20:55:02 Love it.

1639 2018-03-30 20:54:33 Feels like crypto
1640 2018-03-30 20:54:25 To add, payment providers are utilized as a third party service for most banks, especially in developing countries.  Ripple and XRP will help to streamline expensive KYC requirements and may...just may, be used by big banks through third parties; Compliance and savings are key.
1641 2018-03-30 20:54:24 Only until media begins hyping bitcoin and the crypto scene is when it gets bullish. That, I guesstimate comes sept/nov/dec
1642 2018-03-30 20:54:19 see why new money isn't  coming into the crypto market.    The MEDIA
1643 2018-03-30 20:54:19 not crypto
1644 2018-03-30 20:54:16 A rational take. Is this Twitter I'm on starting to wonder. Today is craziness
1645 2018-03-30 20:54:04 Dragonchain launches it's commercial AWS serverless platform #cryptoking
1646 2018-03-30 20:54:04 Coinbase Customer Service doesn't actually read your emails when you send them. They are the WORST. #cryptoking
1647 2018-03-30 20:53:59 #Crypto is about the ease of transfer of currency peer to peer. Try doing that with a credit card. #Bitcoin #LTC #XRP #TRX make it hard to go back to paper bills and people charging me to hold my money #HODLgang
1648 2018-03-30 20:53:38 Did you invest more $ in purses or crypto?
1649 2018-03-30 20:53:36 Don't buy crypto if you have bills to pay! Yeez...
1650 2018-03-30 20:53:23 No problem. That question has come alot lately, so good to ask it.
1651 2018-03-30 20:53:17 Yes. The peaceful way to mass adoption is 3rd world countries start switching to crypto (already kind of starting in one). The violent way is 1st world countries see hyper inflation as they won't take it lying down, they'll go to war...
1652 2018-03-30 20:53:12 You killing BTC prices with memes like this n.aggarwal. Please. Decentralized apps (DaPPs) are extremely important the survival of manking

1661 2018-03-30 20:52:17 Every single crypto uses BTC as a reserve. It's going to be a long, long time before any of them shake that

1667 2018-03-30 20:51:37 Yaaaas bobby
1668 2018-03-30 20:51:34 Thanks for clarifying brad 
1669 2018-03-30 20:51:29 $ZEC is the winner. Optional Privacy is the key to prices rising again.
1670 2018-03-30 20:51:26 You think @bitfinex is a shady crypto exchange? @binance is a hundred times worse and you're about to find out why.
1671 2018-03-30 20:51:24 Haha aye can’t beat em join em they paying for friends lol
1672 2018-03-30 20:51:14 What’s your source?
1673 2018-03-30 20:51:06 
1674 2018-03-30 20:51:06 買いも売りも同等に大事だね。BTCFXやったおかげで、最近やっと分かってきたかも。

たとえ現物だとしても、買ったら売らなきゃいけないわけで、だから買い目線と同等に売り目線も大事で。当たり前だけど。

どっちかの目線だけでやろうとしてきたから利確が下手なのだなあ。
1675 2018-03-30 20:51:01 You are a star caking "exuberance "when btc skyrocketing over 12k .. and mkt capital was going over 600 bn.I understand what you mean now 
1676 2018-03-30 20:50:51 What?! TRX and BTCP. Little man here thinks there's a flippening.
1677 2018-03-30 20:50:39 All coins will until the exchanges allow USD pairing to alts instead of Bitcoin. Remember, we measure them in Satoshi's cause we buy them via Bitcoin.
1678 2018-03-30 20:50:39 Agree. Afraid that 7200 resistance will be problem.. Hope that we will not go under 6600 because of another rejection. 

However, bounce from 6570 after first rejection give me the little hope that we are going to brake  it out in first attempt!
1679 2018-03-30 20:50:11 I have to say, even the free telegram is very good.
1680 2018-03-30 20:50:09 Apparently you, TwitterMasterMindMan!

I know c++, I’ve been doing crypto since Silk Road, love the tech, working on 2 websites currently, enjoy trading, presentable, young, felon(SR related), I can get ya some good x from NL, do u hire felons
1684 2018-03-30 20:49:52 New Industry, New tech, who cares about the prices if you’re investing in the future. Ups and down’s will come and go. Teach your kids crypto and ride the waves like a pro surfer!
1685 2018-03-30 20:49:50 Had a buy order at 6666.00
1686 2018-03-30 20:49:41 僕はいつまでも心は投資の初学者です。過度の期待は未だにするし、上手くいかなくて自分に何度も失望もする。

だからこそ、この相場は人生の糧になって、自分を1回り大きく成長させてくれる素晴らしい機会だと受け止めています。

フォローしてくれている皆さんも、そう考えてくれたら幸いです。
1687 2018-03-30 20:49:32 So your saying it will always be affected by BTC and ETH?
1688 2018-03-30 20:49:30 I can explain the crypto protocols easier than I can remember at which stores I need to swipe, dip or tap.
1689 2018-03-30 20:49:30 Smelling like it
1690 2018-03-30 20:49:26 And if BTC is at 10k or more XVG
Will take off.

1708 2018-03-30 20:48:19 Huh
1709 2018-03-30 20:47:48 IMO this is the #1 lesson in Crypto
1710 2018-03-30 20:47:47 ain't "too old for this shit"
1711 2018-03-30 20:47:42 No, mainnet will not keep it from bring affected by Bitcoin price, that will remain the same. There's tons of coins that are on mainnet and still are driven by Bitcoin price.
1712 2018-03-30 20:47:39 I measure my #crypto against #fiat, otherwise I wouldn't be in this game. Maybe one day I wont need fiat but right now, you cant use #cryptocurrency to directly pay bills. 
#bitcoin #buy #buy #buy
1713 2018-03-30 20:47:36 @Twitter @facebook @Google all Ban #crypto related advertising shortly after each other. Then @MailChimp bans #blockchain related  mailing. Not a coincidence, someone has been leaning on these organisations.
1714 2018-03-30 20:47:28 
1715 2018-03-30 20:47:23 Not sure why a lot of crypto bot twitter accounts started following me about a week ago

1726 2018-03-30 20:45:56 Test the credibility of any #crypto related pitch by replacing '#blockchain' with 'fancy database'.

Eg "fancy database technology is going to revolutionise democracy!"

It is rare to find an interesting social problem that is solved by switching databases.

1729 2018-03-30 20:45:44 I'm a CS master student at @tuvienna, any chance I could participate in that project? Smart Contracts tutor, looking especially for a diploma thesis, want to help in real-world adoption of crypto
1730 2018-03-30 20:45:41 THAT would mean that FUTURE ICOs be securities, that past ICOs should register, but that registered brokers (& ATSs) should be enabled by the SEC/FINRA to trade the major coins trading now on crypto "exchanges" -  That would minimize disruption and maximize investor protection.

1750 2018-03-30 20:44:18 But yeah, the signal to noise (fraud) ratio is very very low at the moment. Unless you spend some time reading about crypto every week, it's easy to get lost.
1751 2018-03-30 20:44:18 Thanks @crypto_loot
1752 2018-03-30 20:44:07 I think you should stop pumping these scam crypto currencies. Looks like they are all see to keep on falling in value.
1753 2018-03-30 20:44:03 What's going on with these cryptos? @SatoshiLite @ltc @litecoin #bounceback #crypto #cryptocurrencies
1754 2018-03-30 20:43:42 Money is simply a representation of value. 

It was created to “grease the wheels” of exchange.

This is how governments can enhance markets.

Although crypto currency may be a game changer.

1783 2018-03-30 20:40:51 So I spent a few days reviewing an excellent paper (was under consideration for publication) that has been made completely out-of-date due to the bitcoin/crypto bubble blowing up over the last half-year.

I feel so bad for the authors cause that kind of meta-analysis is rare!

1792 2018-03-30 20:39:54 Looking at 2-5 years for XRP.  Honestly, its the best option in crypto.  If that or BTC fails retail investors, then it is government and corporate proprietary, closed loop blockchain that'll be the new paradigm.  In that case, retail investors are out of luck for making it rich.

1826 2018-03-30 20:36:31 What I also find archaic is the on-ramp to crypto via wire transfer on coinbase - takes 3 days to be available to trade. Then if I want fiat transfered back to my bank, it takes another 3-5 days. #XRP has the solution, we're just waiting for the rest of the world to realise it

 That’s about it
1832 2018-03-30 20:35:47 People want to know why the #cryptocurrency market is bearish? The answer is pretty simple. It’s because people settle for selling their crypto for these prices. If you want the market to go up stop selling for less than it’s worth. Applies all around. Just my 2 cents

#bitcoin
1833 2018-03-30 20:35:42 Picked up some #eth between $375-380. Pretty tight staggered stop losses. Cautiously optimistic. Not near my computer, so no chart #crypto #ethereum #dyor

1850 2018-03-30 20:34:23 Yeah no way in hell it’s happening in our lifetime but it’s still a noble goal to aim for and to teach our offspring to aim for. For now we can use technology as our crutch to improve the living conditions and processes of everyday life. That’s why crypto is so important.
1851 2018-03-30 20:34:09 Just stopped at a gas station in Central New Jersey and they have a machine where you can purchase Bitcoin. I didn't have my phone with me but I will snap a picture of it a post it. @TheCoinLawyer @maserati_crypto

1853 2018-03-30 20:34:00 Crypto bagHODLers are grasping at straws now. Everyone knows that most ICOs are scams, exchanges are fraudulent, nobody is using Bitcoin. But they keep defending the guys who screwed them, hoping their useless coins will rebound, and they'll be able to dump them on someone else.

1859 2018-03-30 20:33:18 for sure one has to go, and we desperately need the return but I think Tanev's value has fallen faster then crypto currency thanks to all the injuries, so they will lean on Edler till he waives.
1860 2018-03-30 20:33:18 Imagine if that support breaks though. That's when panic sets in

1862 2018-03-30 20:33:01 We’ll see. I think a crypto digital currency will usher in the one world order. This is what all the enthusiastic realise - we are the hamsters. Not what I want but it’s damn likely. Fully traceable. Controllable. Bye bye dissent & rebellion.

1921 2018-03-30 20:26:54 yeah it's a chicken and egg thing. most merchants aren't going to accept crypto unless it's instantly converted to fiat cause they're too scared of volatility. and without merchants accepting it we can't easily spend it.

1943 2018-03-30 20:24:12 I love crypto, and I have faith in blockchain but it will never become a currency. Country and bank will stop it way before. There is so much more then the currency part in crypto.
1944 2018-03-30 20:24:07 1) why should a credit limit exist if you have money to pay it
2) that’s like leaving a safe open for 10 seconds both are just as easy of a mistake
3) at least you can see who has that transaction on the blockchain
4) You should know anything on the inter web is a liability

1964 2018-03-30 20:22:36 I agree.  I aimed for a number of #Zerps so that I can sell when it hits certain prices.  I have done the same for $XLM.  Only advice is, follow your goals and don’t let greed blind you.

The company is young, but very promising, soon to be out on the ICO, so I advise everyone to closely follow news of the project!
1967 2018-03-30 20:22:34 Chile the main hub of the crypto industry..LMFAO.. geez I would be more concerned if it was Vietnam.. they should of waited for BTC to make new highs to drive the price down with this news 
1968 2018-03-30 20:22:32 At 700B$ the total market cap for crypto currencies was 1/5 of the M1 money supply for USD, with very little usage, so it was getting pretty hard to justify.
1969 2018-03-30 20:22:27 Quit lying. This weekend will be nothing but dump.
1970 2018-03-30 20:22:26 only overweighted ETH holders would believe this.

1973 2018-03-30 20:21:55 Bcashers are literally the flat earthers of crypto. Still standing at $680 
1974 2018-03-30 20:21:51 What do you think the bounce on sunday will look like? Dead cat or a reversal? Whats the lowest you think $BTC will go?
1975 2018-03-30 20:21:46 anyway, sorry for thinking the "crypto" in your handle was a jokey reference to crypto-fascism, instead of the computer kind of crypto, which as we all know has absolutely no shady or RWN associations at all and so it was double foolish of me to think poorly of you.
1976 2018-03-30 20:21:46 Ran doesn’t see an issue with Tether, just like everyone else that is still invested in crypto.
1977 2018-03-30 20:21:37 This is gonna be a thing.
1978 2018-03-30 20:21:17 "This time it's different."

People say it during bubbles, but they forget it during busts.

Every crypto crash in the past was actually a 10x buying opportunity. 

Every single one. 

Do you believe the bears who say this time it's different?

1996 2018-03-30 20:19:43 I would like to be on a list like this one day.. It will happen... gotta plan for the future... Enjoy the weekend all!
1997 2018-03-30 20:19:41 This is a crappy answer even for crypto-standards. Tron has no running mainnet. They still run ads on the Timesquare. If you don't see the problem, you're part of it.

1999 2018-03-30 20:19:37 Go to my profile and drop these songs under my pinned tweet. I want to make playlist created by the community.
2000 2018-03-30 20:19:12 Nah see alts are awesome so is bitcoin. You will cause the opposite to happen. Wish all well. All crypto world.
2001 2018-03-30 20:19:11 I don't scam but send them to me if you want to get rid of them.

Win-win 

(just don't invest, not in crypto, not in regulated markets if you can't process/afford losses, then investing is not for you, just realize that)
2002 2018-03-30 20:19:04 This is big.
2003 2018-03-30 20:19:03 To piggyback, I think we will hear more about the trials of XRP and poss. The trial of XRP and/or Ripple’s solutions with banks. Regulation should be clearer, at least for exchanges, by late 2018...corporate use clarification by 2019. Mid 2019, I hope will bring $10+

2080 2018-03-30 20:11:51 Boyd - curious about your thoughts on why XRP continues to drop. I get the fear w/ crypto in general, and unknown with SEC regs, etc. but with so much momentum and all these companies they’ve signed up - surprised price isn’t climbing slightly or at least holding steady....
2081 2018-03-30 20:11:50 So @aidocme is still being very consistent with their updates to members, joining their telegram is a great idea if your interested in after-ico progress that they've been making, such as the distribution of the airdrop that completed recently. #TOKENS #DOCTOR #ICO #Crypto

2144 2018-03-30 20:05:18 Why should i hold ?
Because u're controling supply ?
Because u're a banking solution ?
Because banks are behind you ?
Because your token costs nothing to be created ?
Because u're taking 20xrp price for each wallet ?
Shit coins will disappear soon

2146 2018-03-30 20:05:06 Since 1) There are non-bank ways to bridge fiat and crypto, including via p2p, and 2) when big money wants to invest in crypto, banks/others would oblige with compliance, I think crypto wins in this case :)

- transaction fees are cheaper than ever. Literally paying less than 1% of the transaction in fees
- less downtime on pretty much every site crypto

2207 2018-03-30 19:59:30 Shorting is selling an asset that you dont currently own. Holding usd/tether is not shorting.

1x shorting would be using borrowed btc to sell for cash, and buying back btc later for cheaper to pay back the btc loan.

2244 2018-03-30 19:56:53 why naked
2245 2018-03-30 19:56:48 This is true. Also, tokenization facilitates value migration across national borders. Success will encourage government entities to take a sliver of a high volume vs. adversarial postures toward crypto.
2246 2018-03-30 19:56:47 Didn't realize at the time but in retrospect Ripple having a 100b market cap was probably a good time to sell some crypto.
2247 2018-03-30 19:56:41 The US is not in danger of being "on sale at Walmart". If any entity wants to sell US bonds the Fed is capable of paying for any amount of them. It only takes the pressing of a few buttons. The reason is that the US dollar is "fiat currency" as every crypto fiend should know.

2272 2018-03-30 19:54:30 Couldn't agree more. That would be a steal. Actually it already is, but below 1$ would be crazy cheap. $ENG below 1$ and $ICX below 2$ would make me spent so much FIAT  What's your $ENG target price?

2284 2018-03-30 19:53:52 If crypto is the future of currency, why is it still impossible to get a crypto mortgage in any of the worlds 195 countries? How come zero of the cities on the planet sell crypto bonds? Zero? Crypto has had zero success. It's just another temporary fad, a ponzi scheme.

We’re building a loyal, free for all, and ranked community for pumps, news, arbitrage, signals and more in the world of crypto.

We’ll be creating an on-going schedule and kicking off our first pump as so…

2300 2018-03-30 19:53:06 Interesting experiment, to explain to my friends+ fam at Easter, I'll be telling them, "while bitcoin is down 65% , I've only gone down xx % in that time", thru some decent alt swaps and preservation. Wishing you all luck during the bear.

2305 2018-03-30 19:52:39 The crypto market is still spawning blockchain platforms like there's no tomorrow.

Most are undifferentiated. Most will release to the sound of crickets.

There won't be 20 smart contract winners. I doubt they'll be more than 3.

Enough platforms. We need products.

2310 2018-03-30 19:52:27 Hell I’ll say it out loud, the strategy of getting Starbucks to receive the bitcoin cash is backwards. The results are embarrassing but for the company to give first in the form of a reward card etc. I can personally say makes a customer for life!

2317 2018-03-30 19:51:37 They may have the opposite effect. If bitcoin goes much lower many noobs will be able to afford 1 whole BTC again. That’s a bullish idea.

2359 2018-03-30 19:47:51 by the way I am not a millenial... But still I think that we are entering the beginning of a new revolution that will take a lot of time... I think BlockChain Crypto, AI and millenial are just the beginning of this revolution
2360 2018-03-30 19:47:49 We will never know what the banks are up to behind closed doors on this. But to think they are sitting back, non the wiser about what’s going on with crypto & especially $xrp ...nah can’t see it. They own plenty of something imo if not $btc it’s self

2362 2018-03-30 19:47:38 1x short is the same as buying tether or switching to usd on bstamp/gdax. Literally everywhere can synthetic short
2363 2018-03-30 19:47:38 Crypto isn't dead. It is a matter of time when one or another version of it becomes mainstream.

2365 2018-03-30 19:47:26 The word ‘guru’... It’s so suggestive when one self-describes with it. Not in a good way.

2368 2018-03-30 19:46:59 It went to 4.7k, I somehow still missed that even when constantly checking
2369 2018-03-30 19:46:49  China needs to stop... they get too trigger happy with the banned button.... 

its ironic that so many solid projects are coming out of the one country that keeps rebelling against them...

Hopefully we will make progress in the right direction soon!

2374 2018-03-30 19:46:19 When BTC is money we win. Also any other commodity has an unknown quantity that we have to rely on reports for the current amount which can be manipulated. BTC (and other crypto) is the first commodity that has a truly finite amount and can be independently audited by anyone.

2379 2018-03-30 19:46:06 They also said... “it isn’t a typical transaction of yours, it goes against the trend”.....so what? Who says I have to stick to a trend? Its my money, I’ll do what I want with it. It’s scary shit, technically the bank can decide what I can and cannot buy/transfer.

Not once in my banking life have they done this for any other transaction, even when the amounts were much higher.

2436 2018-03-30 19:40:47 People should stop HODL and speculate about the price. To stop trusting on the selfish thing they hope to happen, which is price to the moon. 
You are fooling yourself.

People should use the coin, challenge developers for its utility, so the potential it has can be reached.

2437 2018-03-30 19:40:35 Hint: I’m the least non-tech genuis out there and I spent and lot of time figuring out how to setup a Masternode.  Pays hundreds of percentages in annual interest.  Best decision I’ve made in crypto by A Miiiiile.
2438 2018-03-30 19:40:28 When BTC was $20000 everyone wanted to buy it and everyone was talking about crypto. Now that smart people dumped and bought their lambos, and naive people lost their life savings, no one is talking about it.

2446 2018-03-30 19:39:55 The onlything wrong in crypto is people who tough they will be millionares in amonth crying now. If you look at charts eveything is pretty normal. Just a retraction. There wasnt market ib history of markets that was without retractions.

2452 2018-03-30 19:39:26 I've seen signs in all 3. I don't think most hate speaking it
2453 2018-03-30 19:39:11 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。
2454 2018-03-30 19:38:45 Crypto fans been pretty quite lately 
2455 2018-03-30 19:38:45 Could you give a quick run down of meaningful contributions you've brought to the crypto space for me? What've you built?
2456 2018-03-30 19:38:43 Friends don't let friends buy Tron bro

2459 2018-03-30 19:38:21 Although, the more you do the less sense crypto's will make.
2460 2018-03-30 19:38:17 Wish it could pump the tech market of crypto currency

2469 2018-03-30 19:37:36 Yes. With half a head.
2470 2018-03-30 19:37:32 I've been telling you for months to not come to me with your Crypto bitching... Yet you do. I had it. So
2471 2018-03-30 19:37:31 So what if they bought it at 20K. Some people bought it at $1000 and then it went down to $200. Just hold it. And forget about it for now.
2472 2018-03-30 19:37:20 Enjoyed it.. great job, amazing organisation, great people.. zurich crypto rocks
2473 2018-03-30 19:37:14 But the banks must know this, especially those higher up the chain. So what are they doing about it, who knows but they aren’t stupid and I’m sure they are cooking something up
2474 2018-03-30 19:37:03 It's funny that people have to be told to hold for 60 days (like that's anywhere near a long time!) No wonder why $crypto is all over the place. FFS...

2477 2018-03-30 19:36:46 Unfortunately, all I saw today was crypto bashing...we all need to move away from trying to be “right.” @officialmcafee was right in that NO ONE @crypto community should want ETH to fail..crypto needs to take off. Everyone wants “their coin” to be the next BTC, but all will fail.

2484 2018-03-30 19:36:26 Indeed. Stone Age stuff. Also a bank transfer takes 3 days.. insane. No paperwork, no post, so why so long. The banks answer was..”security checks”... Not good enough in 2018
2485 2018-03-30 19:36:22 SERIOUS QUESTION. 

HOW CAN WE GO ON A BULL RUN IF NO ONE WANTS TO BUY CRYPTO? @LandM_Marius @CryptoChoe @HonestlyCrypto @CryptosQueen @Crypto_Bitlord @Blockchain_Jay @nondualrandy @iamjosephyoung @BitcoinBravado @CryptoCred @crypToBanger
2486 2018-03-30 19:36:21 Almost as brilliant as black listing crypto public addresses. Good crypto hygiene means crypto users never use the same address twice any way. The obvious unintended consequence is that people stop saying what they really feel on centralized social media.
2487 2018-03-30 19:36:14 ...i've seen the poisons rising, call them crypto-currencies...
2488 2018-03-30 19:36:12 Yes a system people came together to make. A community that has been together it is unfair for another brand inside of it to say we are the real bitcoin it is misleading ? No. Just promote Bch

2521 2018-03-30 19:33:25 It's totally a question of how much propaganda they've ingested. 22,000 repetitions on Faux news mimics a truth, especially if echoed by others and sandwiched in between some real truths.  When somebody has been watching propaganda they've been brainwashed by Russian spies.

2526 2018-03-30 19:33:08 I've heard about that project, quite interested... But there's one thing I don't really understand... Is it some kind of decentralized exchanger but with more trading / social tools ? If I understood everything well, you cannot buy crypto on their platform. So what's the point ?
2527 2018-03-30 19:33:08 While Tron was making 40% gains this week y’all were crying bout your Neo going to shit. Unless y’all were secretly buying Tron.

2573 2018-03-30 19:29:52 Seeing RP1 tomorrow. Excited. Also keeping crypto out of my mind’s eye and letting yet do its thing. No loss if no sell. In for the hunker down n’ hodl. May your weeks be prosperous and fulfilling Twitterpaters
2574 2018-03-30 19:29:36 Excited to hear them :-)
2575 2018-03-30 19:29:33 I got into crypto late last year so I’m sorry if this is a dumb question. But I keep getting confused, I thought BCH was called “bcash”?
2576 2018-03-30 19:29:26 chris gonna be on da show yall he good dude
2577 2018-03-30 19:29:25 Well I appreciate that! But if you really think crypto is dead, and that's literally all I talk about, then I'm not sure I understand!
2578 2018-03-30 19:29:19 Denial for crypto twitter 
2579 2018-03-30 19:29:02 You gotta keep on truckin Euci
2580 2018-03-30 19:28:59 hey mate- on thinking on this further, i really liked your article.  would you be open to a video interview at some point next week, to discuss your thoughts a little further and further document this for the future?  i am thinking 20-30 minutes tops.
2581 2018-03-30 19:28:49 Source?
2582 2018-03-30 19:28:45 Eventually it will. The million dollar question is when...

2584 2018-03-30 19:28:42 I'll take it. Being smarter than everyone just makes life depressing.
2585 2018-03-30 19:28:34 I'd be happy if it went under 6 and all the way to 3, I didn't study crypto until November.  Would love to get a do over
2586 2018-03-30 19:28:24 Your my kind of crypto girl! Viva la Neo...
2587 2018-03-30 19:28:23 @Shillman_Crypto is one of my favorites.
2588 2018-03-30 19:28:21 Lol chris about to get notification rekt
2589 2018-03-30 19:28:15 Yeah they get eussians as enemies!
2590 2018-03-30 19:28:13 Not true...,Fake News...
2591 2018-03-30 19:28:02 You're the second one to say that in a week. I never noticed. I'm blushing
2592 2018-03-30 19:28:02 this is so sweet!! thank you for taking the time and putting together that wonderful video!!! 

its such a blessing to be surrounded by such amazing likeminded individuals... i truly appreciate your friendship and you are such a talented artist! the sky is the limit for you 
2593 2018-03-30 19:27:58 Lived in the burbs of San Diego for over 10 years, only downside is that the weather will spoil you - I can't function without sunshine anymore 
2594 2018-03-30 19:27:57 Hi Chris welcome be warned this crew is a little sick
2595 2018-03-30 19:27:54 Great answer! Thanks Ed
2596 2018-03-30 19:27:51 on the plus side, we do have blockchain technology and crypto currencies coming to decentralize many industries... It is my literal only hope for a better future.
2597 2018-03-30 19:27:45 If a product is all that and a bag of chips, you wouldn’t need to solicit people to help make it better
2598 2018-03-30 19:27:39 of course not
those who predict around 1500 are just kids that dont mesure the impact that could have if btc reaches that price....will be years to recover ...if recover
Silly people

2607 2018-03-30 19:26:58 Interesting question for all of us to ask ourselves is: What would it actually take to get me to walk away from crypto? Tough question to answer.

2614 2018-03-30 19:26:41 $300 billion a year laundered in the US and only 0.1% detected mostly because anonymous companies are allowed to invest. /// And everyone is making a fuss about #crypto being a serious problem for money laundering!
2615 2018-03-30 19:26:41 @davidhogg111 better get you some armed security. Lol. There's a site on the dark web with a 5 million dollar escrow in crypto coins for your head. Its growing daily.
2616 2018-03-30 19:26:40 Just another reason to #deletefacebook. Amiright?
2617 2018-03-30 19:26:30 @officialmcafee Any idea when the Crypto market will recover? It’s taking a beating at the mo’ 
2618 2018-03-30 19:26:28 Also I fucking KNEW you were a pink Floyd fan I just fucking KNEW IT
2619 2018-03-30 19:26:18 In addition, you have the opportunity on the basis of this project to create your own project using the technical capabilities of this crypto currency.
2620 2018-03-30 19:26:06 oh got it thanks you alwayz got me chicken thats why i luv you
2621 2018-03-30 19:26:05 6 weeks in the normal world isn’t a long time but in crypto can feel like 6 months specially if your watching these markets grinding around every single day it will drive you insane having tension, short of breath and maybe short tempered with those you care about the most
2622 2018-03-30 19:26:01 Cryptocurrency as currency... I searched "Books" & "Drugs" on @openbazaar to see how many are listed with each enabled crypto...

Books
BTC: 2070
BCH: 58
ZEC: 3

Drugs
BTC: 78
BCH: 11
ZEC: 0
2623 2018-03-30 19:26:01 yeah, funny.. those same crypto twitter traders who mocked the people still valuing their wealth in USD mostly seem to be crying right about now, but last I checked, 1 BTC = 1BTC
2624 2018-03-30 19:25:54 I previously invested in various financial instruments, including in crypto-currencies. At the same time I want to note that for the first time I meet such a project. Here you can get several types of income.

2628 2018-03-30 19:25:36 The next question is when later in the year will we revisit a $3-6K BTC dip?
2629 2018-03-30 19:25:19 It won’t while the markets crashing mate! Have you not seen the market cap?! And IF it recovers it won’t go to 1 dollar while there so many billions being held to give away for free. Electroneum now has very little value. No other crypto gives theirs away on mass! It’s doomed

2637 2018-03-30 19:24:52 I hate the idea of regulation but leveraging or futures should not be allowed as it can be fraudulent and gamed in the current crypto world by a group of MM and even exchanges themselves. Imagine if casinos had no regulation/oversight.

2650 2018-03-30 19:23:51 NVDA hates miners. There is stuff like ant miner that is dedicated to mining. The miners are making $2 a day off a gtx 1080 which is sad. I hope crypto goes away.

2660 2018-03-30 19:23:08 Bro, it's rough times right now with all the liquidations. Showing ramen videos may trigger SJW level PTSD of having to go back to work at McShits and eating ramen daily.

The fear is real.

2664 2018-03-30 19:22:49 Do you think it's a coincidence? Or that easy to manipulate the price?
2665 2018-03-30 19:22:47 Great way to look at it!  Doubling market share is no easy feat, especially in this bear market and #XRP #FUDsters.  

Just think about the returns #HODLers will get when crypto bounces back at this higher share!

2669 2018-03-30 19:22:35 i dont think it is selective to think that ridiculing someone for their sexuality is worse than making jokes about someone's giant mustache. you are cynically trying to equate two things that are vastly different, and i think you know it.
2670 2018-03-30 19:22:31 Is "double bull" a thing?

This market is simply too volatile to justify holding unless you have some seriously low avgs.

2724 2018-03-30 19:18:35 #Cryptokami #KAMI #Crypto #KAMIS (0.05 ETH * 800 KAMI ) 40 KAMI + 800 KAMIs + 50 KAMI (bonus from your $) = 90 KAMI + 800 KAMIs (this is a very good deal for you) . (if you have $100 , it will be 100 KAMI bonus).
2725 2018-03-30 19:18:29 Wish I could help...repo guy just came and picked mine up
2726 2018-03-30 19:18:20 I don’t sell in the hopes to buy back cheaper, I just keep buying more. Keeping it simple is sometimes the best strategy.

2728 2018-03-30 19:18:19 @GymRewards i like this crypto
2729 2018-03-30 19:18:19 Ok
2730 2018-03-30 19:18:01 Another reason we like #masternodes:

If a $crypto #whale of a particular project dumps their stake, the block rewards for everyone else goes up. So, although the price takes a hit, the rewards are distributed across a proportionately less amount of people.

2733 2018-03-30 19:17:45 You know that fighting against the system is a terrible proposition right? Also, you do realize that to the very few in power we're like fucking ants that they can crush with ease right? The amount of Hubris in crypto is amazing.
2734 2018-03-30 19:17:45 @ola_supports ur services are getting worse day by day. Policy of cancellation is being missused. Driver himself cancels ride or tell he is far can't come and ask u to cancel.we have to pay charges.

2772 2018-03-30 19:15:34 the point is that if we want to live in a world where we treat everyone fairly then we should treat EVERYONE fairly and not just be selective because it's good for ratings.

In the decline, the level fell to that of middle school, your coin is a scam and yer ugly too.

2872 2018-03-30 19:07:00 How will governments tax people if they will only accept cryptocurrencies for their business? Will governments need to create incentives (maybe in the form of another token) to make people pay taxes? #cryptoquestion #crypto #cryptocurreny
2873 2018-03-30 19:06:54 Very insightful article I do like your writing. btw, I bought 3 copies of your crypto book one for me and two as a gift to my friends
2874 2018-03-30 19:06:49 except this time our bankroll to invest is 10 to 100 X bigger due to the gains from 2017!!
2875 2018-03-30 19:06:45 I Guarantee 90% of the people that voted for Ripple don't even know what Centralized or Decentralized is. They just voted it because that's what you hear about. Shit it was the 2nd crypto I heard about after BTC when I first got in.

2880 2018-03-30 19:06:21 @BunnyToken was just told by customer support that once public trading begins that US citizens still wont be able to take part in the trading of this token. Is this correct? What would make it different than any other crypto(LTC, BTC, etc.). Are there plans to include USA.
2881 2018-03-30 19:06:14 Lmao he the one getting triggered
2882 2018-03-30 19:06:01 The tech stocks like amazon and fb crashing due to recent news and the stock market in general acting up. In case they don't recover the price before May end we might see some of them enter crypto space.

2899 2018-03-30 19:04:26 this exchange thing bothers me that you can put money in your USD wallet and it won't be part of the $crypto market cap. If your money isn't in the bank, in printer paper cash money, then it should be part of the market cap. All USD wallets should be a part of USDT or similar.
2900 2018-03-30 19:04:22 Bless you
2901 2018-03-30 19:04:18 I agree, and have done exactly the same. If anyone out there is a trumper, I’ve got no real time for their ignorance. They don’t care, don’t understand, don’t believe truth and fact, have little to no morals, and feel no obligation or responsibility towards the benefit of society

2932 2018-03-30 19:00:40 @PonziJohn My advice don’t invest in Crypto at the moment prices are going down so hold your money  and if u have already bought hold and don’t sell in loss more than 30%. Wish u good luck in your investment

2956 2018-03-30 18:59:08 I watched a documentary which followed some people who received faith healing. One of them stopped taking their medication believed to be cured and later died. 

Not sure what it was called now 
2957 2018-03-30 18:59:03 Bitcoin futures were not needed for a healthy market. Take crude oil futures for example, they have a delivery date with a certain location to pick them up the barrels. Not the case with bitcoin. There is no actual exchange. Bad stuff for the bitcoin price
2958 2018-03-30 18:59:02 I talk shit about my coins instead of shilling.
2959 2018-03-30 18:59:00 hf, but doesn't seem like the top, au contraire you are at the base. same as crypto, lots of ground to conquer to reach the top!

2978 2018-03-30 18:57:40 You're correct in your final comment, praying on the vulnerable is immoral and wrong.

2998 2018-03-30 18:55:08 Agreed. As a person of faith, I wish these people would knock it off.

To be clear,  I believe healing is real but there is mystery in it. It is rare. And it is not prescriptive.

Faith healers are snake oil salesmen

You're losing $100's or $1,000's freaking out yet the people losing 10's or 100's of thousands of dollars are cool cucumbers. I lost $20,000 yet I'm all in

3208 2018-03-30 18:35:25 I then called their customer care number since i am freaked out, they said that there is some maintenance work going on with @binance server and it may take upto a day to resolve, and also asked me to try bk in 2 hrs.. that’s weird seriously  a day in crypto world is eternity.
3209 2018-03-30 18:35:24 If your #crypto plan doesn't use tokens as a tool that makes this new thing possible that isn’t possible today, you might be chasing the wrong rabbit.

3222 2018-03-30 18:33:51 In my opinion The biggest problem is that there is still more white paper than product at the moment. Once product emerges and bring some solid solution to our modern society, then crypto will take off.

3226 2018-03-30 18:33:25 I just heard the phrase "streaming monetized sunshine" from @TheSunExchange , using Bitcoin and Lightning Network. That's the most awesome crypto thing I've heard in a long time :D
3227 2018-03-30 18:33:22 Much like where we are at with Crypto. Until my parents who are 67 & 73 can easily use and understand crypto we won’t get the mass adoption we all want right now. It all needs to be simple and secure. Kinda like how you have done with VeDAIR. :)

3305 2018-03-30 18:25:06 Thx @boyd_oakes to share this post!

I never had a doubt on crypto markets being fully corrupted and based on manipulation... but this fits so damn well... Scary as hell.

No words.

If $XRP doesn’t decouple next year i will start thinking about heavy bear years ahead...
3306 2018-03-30 18:25:05 Who knows where the bottom is I could care less what actual price is I'm in it for the long haul, it's still on sale, and it will go back up.

3310 2018-03-30 18:24:44 At least when you go to sell it, you won't be looking at offers of 70% ~ 90% less than what you paid for it a few months ago. 
3311 2018-03-30 18:24:42 The advantages??

I DONT KNOW

Seems like Jesus and Crypto have a lot in common on  this Good Friday...
3314 2018-03-30 18:24:30 Having "Crypto" in your username used to mean you were into mythical creatures, but nowadays it just means you bought a lot of make-believe money and think you're Jordan Belfort
3315 2018-03-30 18:24:13 Ok, it's decided. I'm pointing my students at @mjos_crypto 's SHA3 implementation as a (duly attributed) reference for their projects in my crypto course. A wise decision, hopefully?

Thanks.

GG to any ICO that tethered its project's success to mass user adoption.

3324 2018-03-30 18:23:21 気になります
3325 2018-03-30 18:23:17 Because the search is for a crypto that will bring mass adoption, I vote for #Utrust @UTRUST_Official

3328 2018-03-30 18:23:11 Hi Guys im here to show you how to do and talk business and the most important thing to make money with crypto
3329 2018-03-30 18:23:08 Its a risky play because market is pretty trash ATM. Supports are getting wrecked all over. 
We could also see a dead cat bounce at $6k.

But buying at $6200 is a good entry just don't go all in.

3332 2018-03-30 18:22:44 Some people are holding on to their wallets because they believe in the long term strategy. They should check out our affordable loans collateralized by crypto assets!
3333 2018-03-30 18:22:41 I guess these developer guys don't get it. If anyone thinks that unusable dumpster fire lighting is the answer maybe I am supporting the wrong project. Think about it , I AM Joe Public. The average user. What will crypto do to keep ME and those like me involved?
3334 2018-03-30 18:22:30 @canyacoin just received 6 canya tokens randomly to my wallet? Can I assume this is a mistake? First I’d heard of it?

3343 2018-03-30 18:21:15 I like memes, sarcasm and healthy humor. Crypto Twitter is now more human and realistic. I found peace now and a lot less shilling. Levitation, no more fuel to the Moon.

3346 2018-03-30 18:20:27 $BTC $ETH $LTC ofc there will be massive selling with this much over head baggage. & now every1 who was bearish  $crypto also automatically becomes a genius b/c there opinions align with price action, even though there is no correlation between their bearishness and price drop
3347 2018-03-30 18:20:22 LMAO!
3348 2018-03-30 18:20:19 Let me counteract that statement by saying I like you.  You are not a late night infomercial type like so many in crypto.  Keep doing what you are doing or I will curse you too
3349 2018-03-30 18:20:17 Mind blowing
3350 2018-03-30 18:20:12 @CryptoDuckyNr1 why u gotta cuss

3359 2018-03-30 18:19:50 It's a reference to a popular crypto currency, numbnut, also I'm a lonesome Russian bot totally stealing the election from the next charismatic demoncrat with a billion $ PR budget What did you say master Putin, I shall post more flags? Okay—

3365 2018-03-30 18:19:20 This is not healthy... If BTC dies by any means... people will no longer trust on crypto coins anymore.. let alone BCH..

3380 2018-03-30 18:18:23 See brother. Crypto is not about giving u a fish. Its about learning how to catch a fish. You would have learned & earned a lot if you would have not chose to attend any courses.

3385 2018-03-30 18:18:07 Failing/dwindling ecommerce business they can’t sell as easily as anticipated because everyone knows they’re desperate & throwing lowball offers. Combine that w desperation pivot to crypto... why even risk it?
