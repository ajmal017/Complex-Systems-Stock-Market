1 2018-09-12 23:59:51 Once everyone completely looses faith into crypto, that’s when the bull run will begin.
2 2018-09-12 23:59:32 Everyone is going to the prom, we are all pretty and we will all dance. Some of us are prettier than others and can dance better but none the less we will all go to the prom. <Insert “Life is a Highway” here>

3 2018-09-12 23:59:30 Bloomberg I’m fuckin tired of of your click bait titles. Clearly that’s a gross over simplification of his point
4 2018-09-12 23:59:28 Yea I guess that’s actually a good idea... and I could see that happening in the future as well ...

Sports analogy 1- you're essentially trying to give a player the MVP after 1 game.
8 2018-09-12 23:58:07 If in the next bull market $ETH, $XRP and $BCH and other alts do not pump much, then and only then $BTC maximalists should probably make fun of them. It is too early to start shouting now.

Its only when you miss out gains in bull, you become so cocky in bear.

14 2018-09-12 23:56:14 Just so I can catch some clout if this rumor is real, but my buddy just said there is supposed to be some big news in $crypto tomm. Take it with a grain of salt.
15 2018-09-12 23:56:11 From 2 years ago?
Ok. 
You need a Mt Gox refresher maybe?
