40 2018-08-12 23:56:21 Did anyone follow up with that statement after that question was asked? Or are all the beat writers pussies and scared that coconut oil would be sprayed on them?!
41 2018-08-12 23:56:09 Also putting a bit of coconut oil in their fur is a method I use to encourage some of my lazier boys to groom themselves
42 2018-08-12 23:56:08 Two replies and they both sucked haha
43 2018-08-12 23:56:05 I might just make it with the MCT oil to see if there’s any difference between MCT and Coconut oil, but after that I’m using Maca!
44 2018-08-12 23:55:46 2/2. And I didn’t single out oil drilling. Environmental harm comes in many forms. Air toxins, plastics, lack of proper manufacturing waste management, ground water contamination, and much more.
45 2018-08-12 23:55:45 Makes no sense America these states complain about oil production, natural gas ,production mining ,gas production.....but you allow POT to be legalized when POT will kill faster then any of these products mention.
46 2018-08-12 23:55:04 Naphthenic oils is a top significant strategic supply for the aviation industry, especially in the military area, it used as a lubricant for the fighter jet and the civil flight as well. This is another reason that CCP colludes with Maduro's regime-CCP trades US dollars for oil.
47 2018-08-12 23:54:50 I have to think it has everything to do with the rule changes Nascar made in the off season. Splitter, oil pan and radiator placement. Anything with getting air under the car out and creating downforce. Those cars suck to the ground IMO

49 2018-08-12 23:54:19 Gas was $1.38-$1.48 throughout BC, which is quite a deal considering it’s foreign oil. 
50 2018-08-12 23:54:19 The MCT Oil suppose to make you skinny....but if I add a tsp of Maca powder it’ll make my ass fat! 
51 2018-08-12 23:54:11 yep the oil is soaked up so my hands are just soft and smell good for ur last scent im nice like dat
52 2018-08-12 23:53:55 One of the main issues with chronic illness is that living in constant uncontrolled pain does adversely affect mental health. 

I dislocate several joints each day and it would be so easy to be susceptible to snake oil claims of pain reduction.
53 2018-08-12 23:53:40 I swear my scalp is so ungrateful! No matter how much I oil it, it still itches

58 2018-08-12 23:52:18 I LOVE HAINAN, they did the thing where they infused the rice with the broth of the chicken and I  .. I’m a slut for that traditional ginger salt? oil dip
59 2018-08-12 23:52:16 Prove it wrong.  You may also want to explain how oil companies on the south, like Texas, got to claim control over the oil, especially after the US assaulted Mexico and took over by force.  Then explain how continental US was taken over by force not by volunteerism.  Be my guess
60 2018-08-12 23:52:12 Not with this I haven’t. I’m happy for him. I just don’t see why people think I have to cheer for him. Because he finished 2nd once means little. He is good, no debate, but many are just as good, if not better, nowadays.
61 2018-08-12 23:52:12 Researchers in #Pioppi fed a monkey 15,000 calories per day of coconut oil for 1 month. It lost so much weight they were forced to give it a teaspoon of sugar so it could regain it all. Which it did in 1 day & it got diabetes. Makes you wonder why sugar is even legal doesn’t it?
62 2018-08-12 23:51:56 Maracaibo, the second most populated city in Venezuela, was the biggest oil producing area of the world, also among the top energy consumers. Now, after the chavista involution, no oil, and under a constant power blackout, living an end-of-world distopia.

64 2018-08-12 23:51:17 I'm not basing it on one interview. I'm saying he dropped a lot of knowledge and he's in Italy right now helping them secure non Russian oil. It's worth your time

66 2018-08-12 23:51:07 Do I spend $43 on an essential oil diffuser?
67 2018-08-12 23:51:04 It's all about health for Tiger. He'll win a bunch of tournaments the next couple of years if he can stay healthy, and probably even a Major or two. He's just too talented to not win if he's able to play and practice
68 2018-08-12 23:51:00 A guy laughed at me when I asked where the essential oils were in the store. I should have just ordered tea tree oil on amazon and avoided the humiliation
69 2018-08-12 23:50:50 First time using peppermint oil today, i think i like it
70 2018-08-12 23:50:43 昨日帰省から戻った旦那に「お義母さんの様子はどんなんだった？」って聞いたら「俺が九州のどっかに住んでるけど鹿児島だとは思い出せないし、同じことを何度も聞いてきて、あ、ヤバいなって思うけどあと５年は固い（現在82歳）」って言ってました！
71 2018-08-12 23:50:35 Got my mate a set of drums, though all the oil was a bit of an oversight #specsavers #comedy
72 2018-08-12 23:50:08 Definitely good debate.  It does seem the guys that admit it get a pass to some degree.  But wasn’t Bonds just using flaxseed oil?  I’m kidding.  Have a great night.
73 2018-08-12 23:50:02 The reason that CCP devoted to investing in Venezuela and trade with Maduro's regime is in exchange for the Naphthenic oils, which merely take 2.2% of the total oil reserve worldwide, and it merely existed in very few countries including Venezuela.
74 2018-08-12 23:49:57 4 brand new tires for the low. Get these brakes and oil change and Queen will be road ready for family vacation
75 2018-08-12 23:49:52 #AstrosDitchDaysContest oil prices have to go way higher for my job to be better than an Astros home game

88 2018-08-12 23:47:15 Trying to convince my friend to do me some essential oil mixes for my diffuser. Every mix she had while I was in Tampa was amazing.
89 2018-08-12 23:47:09 But you've been wrong about so many other things over those 10 years . . . Tiger has come back a lot further than I thought he would just by getting on the leader board at the last two majors. Win or not, I don't care, but that's impressive given the last decade.

92 2018-08-12 23:46:58 One take on Saudi/$tsla rumor. Pretty sure Saudis still a top OIL producer. So why get in bed with (and support) an EV maker? No amt of tsla profit will ever make up for mass oil demand destruction from exponential EV growth. Why aide in their own demise?
93 2018-08-12 23:46:49 He knows what he’s talking about.
94 2018-08-12 23:46:46 Lady: Excuse me honey. Are the string beans with butter? I can't eat butter.
Server: No ma'am these are made with olive oil.

96 2018-08-12 23:46:11 I accidentally used @JAHRAGER's rosehip oil on my face last week, and WOW my skin. I love you (more now), skin. You look and feel amazing
97 2018-08-12 23:45:42 Went to your M&G in Biloxi and was informed of the rules prior to going in....NO selfies and NO autographs. Damn, why does the squeaky wheel always get the oil?

1). Edin
2). Ogirigon
3). Illuminati saint
4). Illuminati oil
5). Mustard seed
6). A lamb

But the problem about getting the items yourself is that if you get them yourself, how will you send it to us
99 2018-08-12 23:45:38 I had a $60 rewards certificate at Best Buy so I bought a wireless mouse, a Pop Socket, and an... essential oil diffuser? I guess I need to buy essential oils now.
100 2018-08-12 23:45:36 I went to jiffy lube to get my car checked out before my trip and they managed to triple over-fill my oil and my car couldn’t even go a block. It was smoking so bad I might have blown a gasket. So now I have to pay to have my car towed a fucking block AND IM STILL TRYING TO LEAVE

143 2018-08-12 23:39:12 But the instructions are in the name! This leaves me with only patchouli oil as a Coutney-friendly product. If you can’t clean it, mask it in the most hideous way possible.

150 2018-08-12 23:37:19 I know he mentioned oil. I'm literate and tweets are short. Your comprehension of my comprehension is low res. The point is that he has already identified the reason to trade with them. What is low res is pivoting away from the obvious economic benefit towards trade moralism.

156 2018-08-12 23:36:09 Never heard of it myself, I will put the rice in a pan with olive oil and onions and then put some white wine over it and when I dries I would add broth till it's cooked. Never heard of beer rice though, interesting...
157 2018-08-12 23:36:07 Californians the right talks about gas tax they leave out important information like
Last gas tax change 1983, 35 YAG
Oil was $11.70 per barrel 
Minimum wage $3.35, and that isn’t what is paid today.
Cars got about 13 MPG, today 20 plus
 Population has doubled

Don’t be fooled

160 2018-08-12 23:35:42 The US is producing more oil than ever. Isnt the Saudi alliance more about containing Iran at this point?
161 2018-08-12 23:35:36 Send all KKK racist to Saudi Arabia let them drink the oil they have spilled not our blood!!
162 2018-08-12 23:35:18 I believe it’s because Saudi oil controls prices on the world market and we need to be the ally of the country who has that control; otherwise, a player like Russia or China will ally with them and that would be much worse.

165 2018-08-12 23:34:58 I had a similar problem a few years ago. The skin came off my hands up to the elbows pretty quick? Turns out a couple of days before, I had my hands up to the elbows in transformer oil, which was the cause.  So have you been handling any oils, especially used?

200 2018-08-12 23:30:27 i would perhaps be more inclined to respect our modern day military if they were simply defending our country in times of war rather than mostly going over to foreign countries they’re not wanted in so the united states can collect oil and resources for cash
201 2018-08-12 23:30:27 Only like a day, you have to leave olive oil on your hair for hours and then come it for ages and wash it and repeat with cider vinegar, but we were all sat there in oil with towels on our shoulders resenting me hahaha

224 2018-08-12 23:25:08 Money is fungible and the market for oil is international, so source doesn't matter unless blockaded or sanctioned like Iran. Producing more domestically can make them marginally poorer, but only marginally.

"Kecam" will not help other change or fix but by adding oil to a fire. "Help" is the right word of helping 
232 2018-08-12 23:24:15 Did you copy the last half of your article from the oil industry propaganda handbook? Yes, we all need and use oil,  but when people feel their concerns are not heard by those in power,  they fight back in whatever way they can.

236 2018-08-12 23:23:28 Jordan - as long as SA continues to trade its enormous oil reserves in the USD, the US is almost guaranteed to maintain its hegemony.

249 2018-08-12 23:21:07 Your retort comes close, but there’s no problem with neighbors letting each other know who they threw out and for what. As for alt-right...Meh, generalization. Conspiracy theorist, or just snake oil salesman. Take your pick.

Expand renewables. Our economy cannot afford $142 a barrel oil again and the middle east is unstable.

292 2018-08-12 23:14:18 God’s love is the sap.
God’s love is the medicine.
God’s love is the oil.
God’s love is the wine.
God’s love is the milk.
God’s love is the honey.
God’s love is the glue.
God’s love is the solvent. 
God’s love is the water.
God’s love is the blood.

294 2018-08-12 23:14:03 you know how the tin man on the wizard of oz was when he needed oil? That's how my joints are when I stay awake for 24 hours
295 2018-08-12 23:14:00 His strategy worked until oil prices plummeted.

OIL！
297 2018-08-12 23:13:49 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,
yaitu : cengkeh (cloves) & pala (nutmeg), serta no.2 dalam karet
alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
298 2018-08-12 23:13:39 How? He just implored the EU to stop buying Russian Oil & Gas and had NATO increase their defense spending. He also has placed sanctions on Russia as well. North Korea? Bill Clinton is the one who gave them food and energy supplies for a promise to stop their nuclear program.
299 2018-08-12 23:13:33 It is...there is no rush my friend. If nothing else, sit back and enjoy the hard-court season on the ATP and WTA 
300 2018-08-12 23:13:18 Look into 1973 Opec Oil Embargo where it all began
301 2018-08-12 23:12:57 I never pay attention to my oil change sticker... Of course, I had plans to be in Roanoke today with family and I'm 200 miles past my last recommended change AND my sensor is saying 0% oil life...
302 2018-08-12 23:12:55 Last summer I was putting caster oil on my eyelashes every night, putting sudocream, using a moisturiser, drinking water, mainting my diet, using a lip scrub and doing the most but I don’t even get out of my bed this summer FUCK SUMMER 18
303 2018-08-12 23:12:48 One has to take the systems as a whole including socialist policies that result in higher taxation and also higher pay. And Norway has a small population but massive nationalised (socialist) oil revenue!
304 2018-08-12 23:12:37 Dropped 40 lb already, looking forward to the next 20. I use LOTS of olive oil, eat avocados & salmon, and never feel hungry. (That's the unbelievable part.)
305 2018-08-12 23:12:33 today I discovered coconut oil on wheat bread. ....why did I just know about this? Bought the oil for my hair, but the jar said use it for spread as well. I did...and I'm not turning back!
306 2018-08-12 23:12:16 小一時間出た服を1日中着てないの？？？？？？？？？？？？？？
307 2018-08-12 23:12:14 I played Fairytale on the juke box every Sunday afternoon as I solo prepped the pub I tended bar at before opening. It was quite popular tune and that was in oil country! Houston. Cecil's still open if you ever get back to Houston for a visit.
308 2018-08-12 23:12:12 It's a proxy war on Iran all part of the plan to obtain the Straits of Hormuz and the oil flow.
309 2018-08-12 23:11:47 @kinderus @KinderBuenoUK why are you guys using #palmoil in your chocolate bars? I’m pretty sure other forms of oil were used in the original recipe or are you only interested in protecting your own country? #saveborneo #banpalmoil @SaveTheRainFor @PalmOilProject @BBCNews
310 2018-08-12 23:11:36 Shoutout to the family members who don’t know that I toured the country and ask why I’m in Indiana and I have to explain what drum corps is in the middle of Lucas oil in broken Spanish
311 2018-08-12 23:11:00 In the midst of the worst wildfires our state has ever experienced, @realDonaldTrump proposed opening 1.6 million acres of California land to fracking and drilling.

His lack of awareness is astonishing.

RT if you agree we need more renewable energy, not more oil drilling.
312 2018-08-12 23:10:57 Lucas Oil Wheatland Mo.
313 2018-08-12 23:10:44 Just used the cleansing oil to get make up off my face - it took off black liquid eyeliner and waterproof mascara with minimal effort 
314 2018-08-12 23:10:43 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
315 2018-08-12 23:10:37 Agree. Cause we’re leveraging our assets for a change instead of just giving them away. They need our oil (& gas in the form of LNG) and Sinopec made sure their government understood that. With all their pollution they need clean gas, not more coal.

318 2018-08-12 23:10:08 As far as I know Roland Rat had nothing to do with Arron Banks or the the rest of the snake oil salesmen, he might have had dinner with Piers Morgan once but we all make errors of judgement every now and then.
319 2018-08-12 23:10:07 boy, they must be really hurt! those pesky human rights have no place with the CPC, past or present, it would seem! Time to finish K-M and revisit Energy East to replace ALL Saudi oil... Baird should fade back to his special place.
320 2018-08-12 23:09:45 Agreed but to be fair, injuries aside, he brought much of his issues onto himself. Be it the off course stuff, to the continual tweaking of his swing over the years and everything else. He certainly has made it difficult on himself.
321 2018-08-12 23:09:32 Absolutely!. I never drown any good cut with anythingof excess ..just a nice light Sheen of olive oil to coat everything so it doesn't burn when I sear before I low and slow..
322 2018-08-12 23:09:26 The ol lady just put on  #pitchperfect3  time to do yard work. Or change the oil in the mower or slam my head in the front door 
323 2018-08-12 23:09:15 I support the 5-nation deal of the Caspian Sea that was struck today in Aktau, Kazakhstan.  The oil and gas resources of this area must be harnessed according to the agreements established by the five nations and delivered to the world, which urgently needs these resources...
324 2018-08-12 23:09:11 Does this mean Bannon, Farage and Boris threesomes are out then? Damn, I'd just bought the truffle oil
325 2018-08-12 23:08:52 aaaaaand it needs an oil change and I’ve been lagging it on that too. lmao later I swear I’ll fucking do it.
326 2018-08-12 23:08:47 HAPPY BIRTHDAY OIL I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY I LOVE YOU  @damagedpeach
327 2018-08-12 23:08:40 Wait, you use balm and oil? How does that work? And do you brush first or at the end? Educate me on beard care @imyke, I’m clearly an amateur! :)
328 2018-08-12 23:08:36 ありがとうございます
329 2018-08-12 23:08:22 Ask the Arms dealers. We buy their oil so they can buy our military weapons. Simple.

331 2018-08-12 23:08:13 Makes no sense. Seems mean-spirited in light of what #Heltsuknation has been through with oil spills.
332 2018-08-12 23:08:12 The Saudi are the linchpin of US hegemony, they control OPEC thanks to the lowest cost per barrel and ample supply to force all the world's nation to trade oil in U$ ... Why we are the world's reserve currency, and they hold trillions in US assets and debt.

335 2018-08-12 23:07:58 Trying out some MCT oil in my coffee this morning
336 2018-08-12 23:07:47 “you’re so soft, coconut oil bitch”
337 2018-08-12 23:07:37 I got tan, put air in Austin's truck. Put gas and oil in my car. Lol. I feel 0retty successful 
338 2018-08-12 23:06:46 Nothing says "good morning po, you just turned 23 today" like that early haplos of efficascent oil to jumpstart your day!
339 2018-08-12 23:06:29 I've heard so many amazing things about this lip oil  I'd love to try it 
340 2018-08-12 23:06:29 Every Norwegian sale of a Tesla is oil industry funded 
341 2018-08-12 23:06:17 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil? 

Eyin weeree @APCNigeria @OfficialPDPNig efun ra yin ni brain ooooo
342 2018-08-12 23:06:06 Coconut oil is slowly getting its hard on
343 2018-08-12 23:06:05 For real tho cbd oil is very potent for anxiety and stress without the more recreational effects
344 2018-08-12 23:05:56 'No oil painting' then?!
345 2018-08-12 23:05:54 Sheikh’s oil money  is very sleekly be careful and be warned
346 2018-08-12 23:05:29 I may just see the end of oil but the end of coal? I will be long dead in about 300 years. We have plenty of time to move, we do not have to rush. I still believe hydrogen will be the main replacement for ice vehicles
347 2018-08-12 23:05:16 Try 1 tsp of castor oil mixed with orange juice. Shake it really good and Down it , take a long walk. You’ll have her by tomorrow morning. My water broke at 4am the next day
348 2018-08-12 23:05:12 Imagine if some of the profits (I'm thinking Scottish oil wealth too,) had just gone into making, delivering and installing renewable tech. We have allowed a 21st century enclosure and our lives.
349 2018-08-12 23:05:07 Banksters fund the oil & gas industries. They also fund the DEMs. Gotta get ALL money out of politics, and have publicly funded political campaigns at all levels of govt. Get rid of that money, you'll get people who have to run on policies not platitudes.
350 2018-08-12 23:04:56 ironically it is the algorithms and the dumbass quants losing a lot of money for hedge funds nowadays...fractals baby:) #oott #cl_f
351 2018-08-12 23:04:48 You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven as her great love has shown. Lu.7:46,47 Amen.
352 2018-08-12 23:04:27 I goot use my Olive oil enfused with garlic. Smige of Garlic salt, pepper ..
353 2018-08-12 23:04:03 Don't worry about it we are not too concerned about the Saudi's, the day after they had their hissy fit and said they do not interfere in the running of other countries, they killed 29 children in Yemen.  We have loads of oil we don't need their oil or anything else.
354 2018-08-12 23:03:43 Curry is the best food, but it's even better with chili oil.
355 2018-08-12 23:03:05 Gullible. I can't believe people believe ANYTHING you say. It's the most bizarre thing, hmm I have some snake oil I'd like to sell them from a raccoon.
356 2018-08-12 23:03:04 We all knew this was coming. Now it is here!!! Borrowing money with high interest rates than using it to build 1150 room palaces is never a good idea! Amd you don’t have natural resources like oil or gas!!! Bankruptcy 101
357 2018-08-12 23:03:04 The most successful people I've met:

1. Know that Brainstorm can Mean Violent Fit
2. Remember that Mechanics can Lift Tools From Floor
3. Sacrifice to the Almost Everyone *and* its One
4. Know that Lubricant can Oil Hinge
5. Worship George Boole
358 2018-08-12 23:02:29 Murphy oil with soap and water works great too
359 2018-08-12 23:02:13 honestly i would rather goat farm than work for an oil company but i heard u can weld washing machines for a lot of money
360 2018-08-12 23:01:59 The good that comes from trading with such a nation is oil. Our economy runs on it. Seems uncharacteristically low resolution of you to frame the issue in these terms.
361 2018-08-12 23:01:57 My productivity level is streaming #FamilyGuy and drinking all day.
Winning.
362 2018-08-12 23:01:18 You are a bunch or corporate funded out of state mining and oil companies. Your only interest is proving up your shareholders and dumping mining waste is Alaska waterways.
363 2018-08-12 23:01:17 Might be bent rotor, or sticky piston, if so clean & lube piston according to the manual if its shimano use mineral oil from shimano.
364 2018-08-12 23:01:16 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
365 2018-08-12 23:00:59 There'll be a time when there will be no coal or oil. But while the BIG BOYS own the resources you won't see hydrogen.
366 2018-08-12 23:00:49 There are two nations that Trump will not defy: Russia and Saudi Arabia. The reason is that Russian oligarchs and Saudi oil sheiks are the greatest sources of unregulated and unmonitored money in the world.
367 2018-08-12 23:00:46 Blend 2 1/2 pints Irish stew with 2 tablespoons carne asada. Mix into  Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve with chili
368 2018-08-12 23:00:42 I got a case of 211 & some Newports for an oil change. You got me?
369 2018-08-12 23:00:32 It’s by the olive oil & vegetable oil

372 2018-08-12 23:00:12 I thought I read last year that since the 70's oil crisis they've been using their trade surplus to buy U.S. debt.

374 2018-08-12 23:00:03 Hey man your imaginary friend can't help that fucking snake oil salesman. He's a fraud you know it and I know it. The only fucking reason you say this is because you guys are the fucking same

378 2018-08-12 22:59:19 Man I was cooking and a bunch of hot oil splashed on my hand  fml
379 2018-08-12 22:59:09 that sucks so much, sorry you have to deal with that on top of everything

peppermint oil soaked cotton balls can help repel mice while you look for a more permanent solution
380 2018-08-12 22:59:03 Come on,Bikers.  Can't wait till these pussys meet up with bikers, well drillers, ranchers, farmers, steel workers, oil field workers, rodeo cowboys, any Southern boy anyone from out West.
381 2018-08-12 22:58:54 It must be the British North Sea. Cos it was explained to us that because of Indy oil has run out in the actual North Sea and is worthless anyway
382 2018-08-12 22:58:50 Honestly...fuck coconut oil...shit is trash trash
383 2018-08-12 22:58:46 It is Scottish oil from what will become Scotland's Exclusive Economic Zone of the North Sea. "British North Sea" is not a recognised international geographical area. It is a meaningless nonsensical term made up by the UK Government.
384 2018-08-12 22:58:12 2sre foji??? econmy aaj bhe patli hai... srf oil or gas ke waja sa khra hai.... diplomatic front pr failed hai apny relations europe or staes sy thk ni kr ska..... aagy ka pta ni hai kt ye policies koi faida daite bhe hn ya nhe...
385 2018-08-12 22:58:03 Today's DNC vote is going to hurt you more than that oil money will help. Bank of that, dumbasses. Set your watch to it.
386 2018-08-12 22:57:41 This is what happens when sane majority gets complacent and does not get out to vote, and then a determined minority gets conned by this orange snake oil salesman and gets out to vote. You get a Resident Trump (he just resides in the White House - nothing presidential about him).
387 2018-08-12 22:57:29 Oil keeps the satanic families/archons in control. They will never change they use our energy for food. Were on a prison planet. Wake the fuck up, most people are matrix programs that are controlled by the alien program. When u die dont come back here. They trap us with beliefs.
388 2018-08-12 22:57:20 Just to specify, virgin coconut oil is non comedogenic. The high fat content means it doesn’t oxidize easily and therefore doesn’t act like a glue to dead skin cells that clog pores

390 2018-08-12 22:57:06 Lock yourself one hour a day in your room - burning essence oil ( preferably lavender) & have an eye cover & rub your temples & massage your head. Salamtek 
391 2018-08-12 22:56:51 That's the confusion. Renewable does not mean clean. It means it doesn't end. You renew its inventories every year with a new crop, unlike oil, gas & coal, which will end some day. I mean, technically they are renewable, but it will take 300 million years!
392 2018-08-12 22:56:34 I just ordered some argan oil. Your hair is goals.
393 2018-08-12 22:56:33 So I’m flying back home and this lady sitting next to me digs into her bag and pulls out a bottle of essential oil, and pours some of it in her hand. OMG seriously? Who does that?! I have a massive headache from the smell of tea tree oil!
394 2018-08-12 22:56:28 literally every aspect of my health from my mood, digestion, skin tone, musculature, small aches & pains, energy/stamina levels has improved by switching to stevia sweetener, & 2x/day protein powder/yogurt mix *1 w/probiotics powder, & switched from canola/veg oil to xv olive oil
395 2018-08-12 22:56:12 Those who brought us christianism and they still kill our People in the name of peace and democratie. I Wonder which God they worship when They rise theirs hands and pray God before they engage in occupational wors under pretext  of talibans. #oil&minerals war.
396 2018-08-12 22:56:08 People with eczema, a good alternative to a bleach bath is to put a few drops of tea tree oil in your bath & Soak for 5-10 minutes .
397 2018-08-12 22:56:05 Because oil is an international market such that even if we imported zero Saudi oil, what happens there would continue to have a major impact on international relations and the oil market?

400 2018-08-12 22:55:55 Must be a bit like those microorganisms that actually feed on oil spills
401 2018-08-12 22:55:44 my premise is that offshore DRILLING is dangerous to all on our coasts. e.g. the deepwater horizon oil spill led to new regulations and trump has repealed them. and seismic surveys DO negatively effect marine life. our oceans have become FRAGILE.
402 2018-08-12 22:55:17 Even worse--->the oil & gas industries get their money from banksters. So do DEMs. The only solution to the corruption of money in politics, is publicly financed political campaigns - all levels of govt.
403 2018-08-12 22:54:59 Every dermatologist I have gone to has said the exact opposite. I’ve personally seen a lot of benefits in using coconut oil (specifically organic, virgin, cold pressed, and unrefined)
404 2018-08-12 22:54:59 I don't even drink coffee but I know bulletproof coffee is all the rage as is adding collagen or mct oil. I follow a bunch of whole30 ppl on Instagram and they all do it
405 2018-08-12 22:54:57 Baby oil gel underrated
406 2018-08-12 22:54:36 That it would make my hair silky smooth. Argan oil works on hair WHY DOESN’T ARGAN BODY BUTTER??
407 2018-08-12 22:54:33 Gonna do a hot oil treatment tonight
408 2018-08-12 22:54:30 Alright, i see you canola oil
409 2018-08-12 22:54:24 That's why we were able to "whoop his ass" -- because England and Russia were already doing a good job of containing the Nazis, and keeping them from reaching the resources they needed to keep the war going (specifically, supplies of oil in the Middle East).
410 2018-08-12 22:53:56 Dumbass Dr. Hottie Update:
He got an oil change they removed his lugnuts and told him that they were swollen and could not be put back on charging him $135 and taking an extra 4 hours  to do. After talking to a mechanic that rebuilds cars “swolen lugnuts” are not a real thing
411 2018-08-12 22:53:56 Except the private insurance corporations are about as competitive  as the oil companies.
412 2018-08-12 22:53:36 Any beard oil recommendations?  Need to get some
413 2018-08-12 22:53:30 Getting closer to finishing up a free online course in essential oil, hopefully finish by tomorrow.
414 2018-08-12 22:53:20 If you own a essential oil diffuser please be aware that many common oils used such as, tee tree and lavender, are very harmful to dogs and cats. Below are a list symptoms of essential oil poisoning and harmful oils you can avoid. 
415 2018-08-12 22:53:14 Oil.
416 2018-08-12 22:53:14 I have bad allergies so I break out in hives, flake, redness often - and this helps keep my skin calm.  As well as the rose hip oil I got from Marshall’s - and I’ve used over the last month and my scars have diminished a lot from my breakouts!
417 2018-08-12 22:53:13 every job i get comes with seven mandatory multiple choice training modules. i only hope that one day i will be qualified to not pour hot oil over the photocopier in a workplace where zero people know my name
418 2018-08-12 22:53:10 Oh ok. I haven’t tried KVD. I just saw your thread on it! hmm ... I use a face oil under my foundation as a primer for all the matte foundations I have. It makes a huge difference
419 2018-08-12 22:53:00 That’s the coagulation. Try Dawn. If it works getting oil off otters and sea birds it will probably wash away human leavings.
420 2018-08-12 22:52:46 I love the superstays . But it seriously is a bitch to take out though. U need some good oil thingymajig

423 2018-08-12 22:52:22 Because celebrities and politicians refuse to use the cleanest oil in the world, and so instead we buy it from terrorist-funding-tyrants who have no environmental regulations at all.

二こめは微妙w
426 2018-08-12 22:51:53 To be honest Canada can do without Saudi Arabia. And honestly since you’re in Canada you must be Canadian too :) Canada buys its oil where it wants to ; you can’t exactly tell people what to do and how to do it .. like you tell Canadian govt not to, right?
427 2018-08-12 22:51:53 I have 3 - $25 gift cards available :) Do you want to try CBD oil or Black seed oil ? Comment below 
428 2018-08-12 22:51:24 Lemmie just stop all you good folks from cleaning up this oil spill for weeks while we prepare for our climate change meeting. Shit, didn't give us the leverage we needed, now we'll pay cronies to sink the problem w toxic chemicals. But you can't have phosphates in your soap!

430 2018-08-12 22:51:13 $20b for a heavy oil refinery is far cheaper than the annual $15b we'd have to spend on the military just to meet the NATO membership requirement.
431 2018-08-12 22:51:11 I’m combo/oily - I use warm water too. Things that have helped me: I use this rose water toner from ulta by Mario badesceu (sp?) super affordable. And I use this moisturizer from lush called magical morninga that has a matte finish. Other oils I’ve used are rose hip oil and vit E
432 2018-08-12 22:50:45 Kalau cari yg oil controlnya bagus innisfree si
433 2018-08-12 22:50:34 This has nothing to do with PDP or APC. We are in a country where people are deprived salary for months and then given stipends to gain their vote. Salt, Power oil with a fancy bag from said leaders.
These people are hungry and are being played with. This is cruelty
434 2018-08-12 22:50:34 olive oil lube
435 2018-08-12 22:50:17 Trump has allowed drilling in Alaska. In a few years, not only North America will become free of oil imports but will become a big exporter of oil. Saudi Arabia will go bankrupt.
436 2018-08-12 22:49:50 I use Olive Oil always for cooking and almost always with a glass of red wine. Olive Oil represents the Holy Spirit and Wine the blood of the Messiah.  Are these some type of religious nut cases or antichrist religion?????
437 2018-08-12 22:49:31 Oil check!!
438 2018-08-12 22:49:30 Dinesh D'Souza is a snake oil salesman.  Read the history books for yourself rather than his warped interpretation of same.  Oh but, that might get in the way of your own internal racist narrative.
439 2018-08-12 22:49:19 What is stopping Britain from managing its own oil and gas..? Greed, greed of the few to rule the many and keep them poor. And stupid. The problem is that you view things as they are instead of what they should be.
440 2018-08-12 22:49:14 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
441 2018-08-12 22:49:09 I was gonna compare amazing interiors to my cribs. But this guy straight up built a living room size aquarium with a reef. And then there’s a young couple begging and borrowing to turn an old oil tanker into a house.
442 2018-08-12 22:49:05 In 2012, @IEA reported that Nigeria loses US$7 billion (N1.159 trillion: 2014) yearly to crude oil theft.
443 2018-08-12 22:48:54 I was walking to my car and a woman started talking to me about how cannabis oil cured her vaginal dryness and I’m just gonna accept this as my new normal in Berkeley
444 2018-08-12 22:48:20 Then help the hungry in Venezuela! Instead Uncle Sam is trying to foment Revolution by strangling their economy! Where is the aid? Haley, your evil! We Want their Oil! Biggest Reserves on the Planet!
445 2018-08-12 22:48:12 She's a lot like Trump in that she will say whatever she thinks will get the response she desires. Truth, facts, common sense, or reality have nothing to do with it.  They're selling snake oil and Fox News is doing the advertising.
446 2018-08-12 22:48:02 Tell that Texas oil workers

Liberals find ways to kill industries faster than industries can keep up

Look at how you've infucted our colleges if you want to talk inflation. These alleged geniuses raise tuition at double and triple the CPI to extort parents
447 2018-08-12 22:47:54 I HATE FISH OIL PILLS SO MUCH.
448 2018-08-12 22:47:16 Do an oil treatment before and after braids. 
449 2018-08-12 22:46:48 石に余裕があったらやってみてほしい
450 2018-08-12 22:46:36 It is Scottish oil from what is/will become Scotland's Exclusive Economic Zone of the North Sea. The "British North Sea" does not exist as a known or defined geographical area.
451 2018-08-12 22:46:14 i bought the fenty foundation a few months ago and i’ve really been trying to make it work, i’ve tried it with matte primers, with oil primers, with just moisturizer underneath, silicone primers and it never sits well on my skin and if i put anything on top it lifts the product
452 2018-08-12 22:45:43 you can control the oil by setting an oil control primer with powder before foundation.. have you tried that?
453 2018-08-12 22:45:30 Put tarrifs on US goods after they impose tariffs tit for tat. KSA cuts all financial ties to Canada and we will still import their oil. This gov is full of morons.
454 2018-08-12 22:45:25 Their starting to leak oil.
455 2018-08-12 22:45:22 やべぇみんな起きてきたぞ…
456 2018-08-12 22:45:13 I made these crumbed mash potato things and they’d literally just came out of the oil and I say to my mums boyfriend you want one ? They’ve cooled off thinking he’d grab it and burn his finger but he PUTS THE WHOLE THING IN HIS MOUTH AND JUMPS AROUND YELLING ITS HOT ITS HOT 
457 2018-08-12 22:45:09 i feel like i lost a bit of coverage w the oil but honestly it's for the best cuz it felt like a mask before anyway.. i'm a new woman
458 2018-08-12 22:44:45 He can give me an oil anytime
459 2018-08-12 22:44:44 Still think tiger will never win again?
460 2018-08-12 22:44:38 By radiation machines do you mean radio therapy, you could just grow cannabis and give the patients a pure oil cure instead x
461 2018-08-12 22:44:35 I call Karasu "Kuronue" every time. I did it like 300 times in the footage for the blu-rays and even the Kurama hair oil since he's on the box. I hate this man so much my mind just rewrites him with the superior black bat.
462 2018-08-12 22:44:31 tim woodson & the heirs of harmony - oil in your vessell
463 2018-08-12 22:44:11 Perhaps we could achieve it by taxing the consumption of oil resources heavily? Hmmm, would could we call that? A HydroCarbon Tax? Maybe Carbon tax for short? Perhaps that could solve another problem too....
464 2018-08-12 22:43:46 Ohh just en janvier . If you really want to cut it go ahead(just watch for the lunar calendar ) and to grow it out : scalp massages + babe essentials long hair dont care oil 
465 2018-08-12 22:43:43 Oh, that's pretty smart. The soldiers are under the ground like the oil they died for.
466 2018-08-12 22:43:40 @NancyPelosi Please make sure that the DNC does not reverse its ban on accepting money from gas, coal and oil companies!
467 2018-08-12 22:43:34 Checking the old oil on the big car
468 2018-08-12 22:43:31 No. I haven’t tried it but tbh I don’t mind the heaviness bc I’m an oil slick and also I sweat easily . And once it dries tho it isn’t so bad.
469 2018-08-12 22:43:22 Got a hair cut, bought some coconut oil, new shampoo and conditioner, a brand new face mask, and I’ve been eating healthy, I feel like a million bucks 
470 2018-08-12 22:42:43 KSA cuts all financial ties to Canada yet still will be shipping oil here and we will keep buying it like a bunch of schmucks. This country is a bad joke.
471 2018-08-12 22:42:33 have you tried cbd oil? anti-anxiety without the super high feeling thc gives off
472 2018-08-12 22:42:24 Oil Check
473 2018-08-12 22:42:20 Beard oil prototype. A friend has a beard company
474 2018-08-12 22:41:50 I think fried...with anointing oil..
475 2018-08-12 22:41:27 I want some Mexican food but I really don’t need to be driving I’m in a severe need of an oil change 
476 2018-08-12 22:41:16 As they've said on countless occasions during the broadcast, for Woods to go out and shoot a 64 in the fashion he did is pretty incredible.
477 2018-08-12 22:41:13 dude went on a tirade, demanding that all "progressives" vote for the specific DNC dems in the pocket of oil & gas corporations - or the republicans will win and kill us all because they don't believe in global warming. then ended his rantings by quoting both george the younger
478 2018-08-12 22:41:12 The salient point is if you agree Canada should refine it's own oil in Canada then Energy East was an excellent way to get Canadian oil to Canadian refineries.  

Basically stating the obvious I know.
479 2018-08-12 22:41:00 I just get in my car and go. Who has time for oil changes, car washes, & maintenance? I even hate stopping for gas 
480 2018-08-12 22:41:00 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
481 2018-08-12 22:40:47 The world/universe they have built in Dishonored is so cool. There are inventors and philosophers. There’s a revolution brought about through the use of whale oil. There’s all this supernatural stuff that ties into the afterlife.
482 2018-08-12 22:40:36 CBD oil. Order it online
483 2018-08-12 22:40:11 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
484 2018-08-12 22:40:07 I thot they wanted it reduced so oil and gas companies and other mining ops could make profits off our natural wonders. Sort of like desecration of the land.
485 2018-08-12 22:39:52 Coconut oil is a sealant girl! Your skin will get DRY okay. What’s your skin type??
486 2018-08-12 22:39:48 Few things smell as good as onions and garlic sautéed in olive oil
487 2018-08-12 22:39:46 Come over and let me treat you like you want, pleasure and pain I see you bite them sweet lips wait till am done you will sleep smiling... Cos am end the day with an oil massage.
488 2018-08-12 22:39:43 I never mentioned big pharma. I asked for empirical evidence for the claim that cannabis oil is a 'solution' to cancer. An RCT does not need to be carried out by big pharma. Still waiting for evidence, though. Do you have any?
489 2018-08-12 22:39:29 Took care of everything we needed: plants, peaches, soap, salsa, dry Rub ingredients, Cbd oil, fresh lemonade. Plus had some awesome crepes. 

Boulder’s is the only that really compares (that I’ve been to) but it’s a drive.
490 2018-08-12 22:39:18 me: * works two weeks 6 days a week gets a $400 paycheck and $200 in tips. *

my dad: your car has an oil leak

me: how much is that to fix

my dad: $700

me:
491 2018-08-12 22:39:08 Congrats Diane Marie, you've out done your self here with your twisted logic. The NB refinery already takes on Alta oil that comes by train, the mktt will determine what the Irving's will pay vs other oil, but if Iran, Venezuela and Iran and Saudi is off limits then things change
492 2018-08-12 22:38:34 nice...I have a can of sardines or salmon about once a week instead of fish oil supplement and thought you may be adding it in yourself....don't want to miss anything!!!!!
493 2018-08-12 22:38:31 Boregos osvoi a suvir los inpuestos osvoi asuvir el gas oil que es coloque viajais voi a joder a los enpresarios para que os echen al paro voi asuvir los inpuestos a la banca para que olosuvan a vosotros os voi a joder como zp imas para que esteis contentos
494 2018-08-12 22:38:18 Exactly, send the entire bunch home and give the spaces to Canadian students, and stop receiving Saudi oil.
495 2018-08-12 22:38:08 if US stops importing oil confidence in dollar will fall
496 2018-08-12 22:38:00 Me looking at my beard oil but it
497 2018-08-12 22:37:42 Apply coconut oil.

You can use moisturizers or lotions with a coconut oil base, they are good for hydrating your skin and reducing stretch marks.
498 2018-08-12 22:37:40 Umm, it had baby oil on it
499 2018-08-12 22:37:28 Olive oil and lemon juice make a difference from soybean oil and vinegar.
500 2018-08-12 22:37:13 Sad thing is.The rich ask the poor ( military ) to fight their battles for oil , Haliburton, Lockheed Martin , and Boeing profit.  Then when athletes from poor neighborhoods protest about unarmed blacks being shot in the back. Rich people say that is a discrace to the military.
501 2018-08-12 22:37:07 Word.  Can you imagine French fries without oil? THE HORROR. 
502 2018-08-12 22:37:04 Good article. I think if Leon and RNH flip, RNH can still be successful in a two way role, give the correct linemates, and after last year, please no more Lucic - RNH, those players are like oil and water.
503 2018-08-12 22:36:34 And hot oil
504 2018-08-12 22:36:12 Up from the ground came a bubblin crude OIL that is, Black Gold Texas T. Well the first thing you know Old Jeb's a millionaire. Kin folk said `Jeb, Move away from here! Said Californie is the place you wanna be! So, they loaded up the truck......
505 2018-08-12 22:36:07 It's not actually a Jewish or Israeli issue. Levy also needs to say that those making the anti-Semitism smears against Corbyn & Labour are taking instructions from Trump & the US far right. And that Trump takes his orders from the US oil companies.
506 2018-08-12 22:36:05 @Presidency_GMB 
How's it going with the oil blocks A1 and A4? When will the process in ICSID be finished?
507 2018-08-12 22:36:01 Cone on, Indonesia! You're already prostituting your resources to foreign interests for the nation-destroying palm oil industry. One earthquake is all it will take to bring this behemoth down.
508 2018-08-12 22:35:50 Ghfjjfjddhfhdj HE COULD USE COCONUT OIL OR SUM ALTERNATIVE GODAMN I COULD BUILD A WHOLE HUMAN WITH THE AMOUNT OF SKIN HIS LIPS SHED
509 2018-08-12 22:35:36 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us NUCLEAR GENOCIDE!
510 2018-08-12 22:35:30 @faizashaheen Re your mention of Amazon on Sky Papers. So big it counts as infrastructure and the UK operations should be nationalised like an oil company,  They are mining for money, and should pay Royalty for the privilege. Would fix most tax issues plus generate dividend. :))
511 2018-08-12 22:35:25 FWIW, snake oil sales are not a major problem at DEF CON. They are much more relevant at Black Hat, which is the one *less* rooted in hacking culture, more like a standard trade show than a festival, and with more money.
512 2018-08-12 22:34:47 China removes tariffs on USA oil!
513 2018-08-12 22:34:38 Totally. But when something’s being touted as “healthier” than its oil containing counterpart it is grating AF.
514 2018-08-12 22:34:32 By seeing whether or not movement towards and achievement of the goals they set themselves has occurred.

- More oil than ever being produced and burnt.
- More coal than ever being produced and burnt.
515 2018-08-12 22:34:30 I'm used to cooking for myself  Best tip i is keep it simple & fresh produce. I love fresh fish so its normally grilled then a little olive oil & lemon juice... sometimes a few boiled spuds & salad or Broccoli - @RedMedusa13 cooks some fab meals for 1 - I love her style & flair
516 2018-08-12 22:34:23 Got me a oil change, filter abd a new battery bout to have my car running nice
517 2018-08-12 22:34:21 Nope. It's vegetable oil.
518 2018-08-12 22:34:17 Trying to save time & money for your business in the #oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
519 2018-08-12 22:34:11 After allowing asbestos, can we allow oil spills next?
We should flood the oceans with oil and just burn it all down. 
We don’t deserve to live on this big blue marble.
520 2018-08-12 22:33:49 Ohhhh I saw the essential oil tweet before the water tweet 
521 2018-08-12 22:33:48 They buy trophies with oil money 
522 2018-08-12 22:33:41 Oil. They have a ton of money in climate change denialism.
523 2018-08-12 22:33:30 But you ll never would beleive this point of view. I guess you are fighting for you own freedom not for oil and Arms Industry cartel of the USA. The basic result of that is that couple EU countries now feeds couple of million refugees.
524 2018-08-12 22:33:29 @maimuhyai 
Any updates on African Petroleum and Oil blocks A1 and A4?
525 2018-08-12 22:33:13 Salvation is free but the oil is not #DrMedinaPullings
526 2018-08-12 22:33:02 Is Gun Oil a humectant? Can I use it to pour pans of shitty Cotmam paint?
527 2018-08-12 22:32:59 I wonder what today’s viewership numbers are gonna look like against the last 5yrs of majors. #pga #TigerEffect
528 2018-08-12 22:32:54 If anyone has any tips tricks etc to improve a old dog with skin allergies skin I’m all ears
Currently he has: flax seed oil, raw egg, grain free high end food, allergy meds, homeopath allergy spary, medicated shampoo, and a t shirt to help him from rubbing his skin off
529 2018-08-12 22:32:50 They were good. A strawberry henny and a flaming lava but then i went and got an oil change and that shit blew my buzz
530 2018-08-12 22:32:42 映画とかも見返すぞ
531 2018-08-12 22:32:39 Go solar. Oil companies are closing
532 2018-08-12 22:32:38 The connection with the US dollar and oil. I think it might just a conspiracy, but not 100% sure. Thought maybe you guys would know
533 2018-08-12 22:32:37 My dad looks a fool changing my oil rn

536 2018-08-12 22:32:09 The Western military haven't fought for freedom since WWII, and even then that was a more of a fight for AngloAmerican access to Middle East oil fields. Our freedoms and rights have been fought for by working-class activists standing up to a grasping arrogant wealthy elite.
537 2018-08-12 22:32:02 I think you’d like it it’s meant to be super matte and oil proof!
538 2018-08-12 22:31:57 Those are some nice looking doughnuts. How do you deal with the oil when yer done?
539 2018-08-12 22:31:46 Japanese bikes have been better for years. Harley is name only. Oil leaking over priced.
540 2018-08-12 22:31:24 Seems like Putin and his KGB friends had a program to get Donald Trump elected. They also had a plan to remove the sanctions and cut a deal with Exxon to move lots of oil. Part of their plan was successful, we have a traitor for president.
541 2018-08-12 22:31:23 Sleeping with coconut oil in your hair literally smells like you’re sleeping with a chocolate bounty under your pillow
542 2018-08-12 22:31:18 Sovereign Wealth Fund will go along way to address side effects of oil revenue. In general this is a good news story.
543 2018-08-12 22:31:09 Would have been better if he threw a rally and nobody showed up to protest. 
From personal experience, nothing irritates ppl trying to get a rise out of you than ignoring them.
544 2018-08-12 22:31:07 It’s the misinformation and fear mongering that has sunk the opposition to KM. Vast majority support and it gets built. Just think, your education is 2/3 paid for by oil. Beauty.
545 2018-08-12 22:30:59 @SOPHIEMSMSMSM @transgressiveHQ Any word on a vinyl release for Oil?

549 2018-08-12 22:30:47 One doesn't need an arts degree to see the risk of additional oil storage tanks on a mountain
550 2018-08-12 22:30:29 There's no need for anything to add up to me, please go if you enjoy it and if you can expense it, or course do so!

All this showiness combined with money will increase your snake oil salesmen content, fwiw. And count me out.

553 2018-08-12 22:29:35 Perhaps you could encourage your  illustrious leader to support building Enery East pipeline and discontinue importing SA oil.
554 2018-08-12 22:29:31 I’m deep frying tofu cubes to go in the laksa tonight. I may never get all this oil cleaned up...
555 2018-08-12 22:29:19 Agree - D'Andra is smoke & mirrors. That skincare line no one's heard of nets less than half a mill a year; she was willed her house and that "Oil & Gas Trust" is $5k a month not millions She needs this show #RHOD #Facts

557 2018-08-12 22:29:14 Most recent fracking is on the ConocoPhillips side of the field. Exxon (closest to eq) hasn’t fracked in a LONG freakin time and BP (field around Deadhorse) hasn’t fracked since oil prices busted four years ago
558 2018-08-12 22:29:12 You have a diffuser for that oil?
559 2018-08-12 22:28:55 At least you guys have medical.  It's still inaccessible in Aust even though we supposedly have access. I'm facing 18yrs jail for supplying free cannabis oil to ppl that were dying. I'd move to the US bt I'm banned for 5yrs for my cannabis use . FTG  #legalisecannabisnow
560 2018-08-12 22:28:48 I'm having an allergic reaction on my neck and I'm hoping it's not from my coconut oil I'll be hurt
561 2018-08-12 22:28:47 big sunday mood: avoiding your responsibilities yet still getting to coast on an inflated feeling of accomplishment because you put coconut oil in yr hair
562 2018-08-12 22:28:41 They will when they grow up and discover the world is a really big scary place with dictators pimping their oil and getting rich instead of paying for the bulk of their education. But carry on.
563 2018-08-12 22:28:34 Oil?
564 2018-08-12 22:28:23 Remember when everyone told me this morning to put sunscreen on instead of tanning oil? Ya apparently I should have listened 
565 2018-08-12 22:28:13 Dude I use coconut oil on my face instead of soap/lotion/remover and my face is so clear
566 2018-08-12 22:28:10 I feel a headache coming on and I don't want it. It doesn't help that I had a late dinner and accidentally left too much oil on the eggs which got absorbed by the food around it make me feel sick after eating it...bleeehh *lays down*
567 2018-08-12 22:28:01 All bullshit this isnt a new ROW that is being proposed its a new line on an existing ROW in which the oil company has purchased land rights years ago. There is no legal foot to stand on for any jurisdiction in BC much different than say NG which would have been a new route.
568 2018-08-12 22:28:01 Declaring a separate nation from Nigeria was never gonna work out especially with the oil resources in some.of.the regions 
It was never going to be a peaceful exit
569 2018-08-12 22:27:56 On the bright side, sanitation workers and LE get a lot of overtime.
On the downside, maybe millions spent of taxpayer $ that could have been better utilized. 
Nothing changed in court of public opinion
570 2018-08-12 22:27:46 They look so damn good!!!  I can imagine a toast with melted cheese, a good slice of those tomatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper 
571 2018-08-12 22:27:40 who got dab pen oil
572 2018-08-12 22:27:23 We can't continue to ignore the economic benefits that fracking could bring. I'm tired of being held hostage by a minority of loud naysayers.  With proper regulations and oversight this could help with our dependence on foreign oil. #nspoli
573 2018-08-12 22:26:57 You have to moisturize with a good oil like rosehip or almond after.  it’s not for everyday use either ....
574 2018-08-12 22:26:29 I think it’s time for me to get an essential oil diffuser
575 2018-08-12 22:26:28 Oil paint most likely 
576 2018-08-12 22:26:25 Hey @BillGriffeth @ScottWapnerCNBC @TheDomino - Kernen’s man Brooks looks like he will take the day. He has come out on a Sunday and just kept his foot on the neck on this championship. Tiger late again leaked a little oil and couldn’t hit a fairway when he needed it.
577 2018-08-12 22:26:18 Because EXXON-Mobil, Shell, Chevron mega-Oil Corporations-all with massive oil fields in Saudi Arabia would go ballistic, and Trump does not need extra Globalist enemies!
578 2018-08-12 22:26:13 Can you imagine if chemistry wasnt a thing and just adding eggs and oil would produce mayonnaise every time
579 2018-08-12 22:25:37 The government needs to take Norway’s nationalization of the oil industry as example. Then again Norway does a few things nicer.
580 2018-08-12 22:25:33 8 minutes. Golden Brown.  No oil
581 2018-08-12 22:25:26 Nowadays when you are cooking for people you’ve got to ask what their dietary requirements are. A real sign that we are overfed. But this lot have requested a meal not cooked in olive oil (that’s as foreign to me as no spuds), no wine or alcohol..... 
582 2018-08-12 22:25:14 まあ、仕事なんですけど
583 2018-08-12 22:25:01 the idea is foreign to you because you are well placed in some hierarchy or other, so disbanding the corporate oil hierarchy makes you fear for your position. a majority is not so well placed as you, so they do not fear the demise of oil corporations as much as you do.
584 2018-08-12 22:24:58 Are you speaking for Canada or US? We in the US are good, we've got shale oil. I don't know about you guys.

588 2018-08-12 22:23:14 the funny thing....not so hahaha funny....is that it IS a terrorist agenda. like monsanto POISONOUS CHEMTRAILS, crappy medical insurance, dumbed down american education (go away betsy wetsy devoss), oil/petrochem assault on earth, flora and fauna, dark money control.....
589 2018-08-12 22:23:00 Stronger DXY = lower oil prices = problems in Russia and Arabia ... Who believes in 80B$ from Arabia in the end of cycle?
590 2018-08-12 22:22:57 @realDonaldTrump is trying to increase US production.  The Dems oppose US production.

However, even if US did not import any SA oil, we could not let SA fall into Iranian or other Jihadist hands b/c that would give them too much wealth and economic power.
591 2018-08-12 22:22:47 Indeed.  No more Saudi oil.  Conservatives should support our government on this issue and intensify its support of pipelines and refineries in Canada moving and using Canadian oil!
592 2018-08-12 22:22:23 If Canada would invest in its own oil production industry, we could but opposing any kind of pipelines and refusing to build refining capacity levels us with no other choices.

597 2018-08-12 22:21:02 Action!
Especially high-tech products should have very high customs tax.
The customs union agreement with the European Union must be updated urgently.
Trade with China and India should be done on national currency. This action should be extended towards oil and gas exporters.
598 2018-08-12 22:20:54 Black castor oil is magical!
599 2018-08-12 22:20:47 I just spray a pan with olive oil, squeeze a lime on the sprimp and top it with cilantro and more lime with red pepper flakes i used to use butter instead of olive oil but I’m being healthy now lmao

601 2018-08-12 22:20:04 Other than the gas exploration team that arrived today to blast and thump the AWNR to test for oil and gas - this ain't no earthquake zone lady
602 2018-08-12 22:19:56 Don't fracking give any ground. Shut off thier oil, water, wood, power. Then you will see THEM backtrack. Also kill American pharmacological patents. Tired of being a slave for the Americans.
603 2018-08-12 22:19:33 You ever just waitin in bed for yo girl to get off work so you can rub her down with coco oil after you run her a hot bubble bath cause same

608 2018-08-12 22:19:25 My dear, the Nigerian crude oil is the best in the world, but the corruption in Nigeria is the worst in the world, Buhari has given his daughter a director of NNPC with a salary 6 million, that is what is the difference between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria

614 2018-08-12 22:18:22 psg will destroy football if this continues, hate clubs like them and city. Only relevant because of oil money.
615 2018-08-12 22:18:21 Chop up then fry your sausage in a pan with some seasonings in a couple tablespoons of olive oil then remove them once cooked. Drop the beans right in the pan you just fried your sausage in (sweeten/season to taste). Re-add sausage to beans and let simmer until cooked. 
616 2018-08-12 22:18:20 The good news, oil rich Scotland will still have to use it. Or if they’ve any independent sense maybe they won’t.
617 2018-08-12 22:18:16 The liberal elite will never understand Brexit, because it brings the country no benefit.

The bigots, xenophobes and easily fooled will fall for the snake oil peddled by the nationalists.

Andrea, you don't believe in "global Britain", you believe the opposite.
618 2018-08-12 22:18:08 More than leaking oil.  Blown gasket and head on collision into a giant Redwood Tree at 120mph.
619 2018-08-12 22:18:01 Imagine power projects equipment abandoned at the ports since 2008 just cleared and being fixed by BRF, power projects started by OBJ, abandoned by Yar'Adua & GEJ, while crude oil was above $120 U$D.
That is just one of numerous critical projects.
620 2018-08-12 22:17:43 My skin isn't peeling yet and I just started month 4 so idk maybe I did have an oil field. Only gotta use aquaphor for when my lips get super super dry even with vaseline + when my face turns red asf after threading
621 2018-08-12 22:17:22 Doom looks like he hasn't showered in 3 months, the oil in that hair could power up a small town for 2 months lmao
622 2018-08-12 22:17:16 Think he’s in the bunker. Bad time to leak some oil. Needs to hole this out.
623 2018-08-12 22:16:57 The mosquitoes are eating me up. Ain’t enough tea tree oil in the world

628 2018-08-12 22:16:24 It always grates on me when I see players accuse a publisher/designer of a "money grab" or of being greedy. 

No one in Boardgames is getting filthy rich. If folks are greedy, they're already in IB, oil, or pharma.

630 2018-08-12 22:15:49 Has anyone tried making scented plushies before? I have a mango/starfruit essential oil and I tried follow a tutorial which included rice into a pouch. The smell doesnt last very long. I heard mixing it with poly fil stuffing works but how do I do that??? Any advice?
631 2018-08-12 22:15:42 I would have said for the 150 millionth time, but I’m guessing that’s too on the nose for some.
632 2018-08-12 22:15:39 It’s close to my go to oil.
633 2018-08-12 22:15:29 [pulls out the milk, oil, checks on the coffee..pours that first] And air-bubbles are bad?
634 2018-08-12 22:15:12 It's not a bad thing. I'm just stating that they're mixing it with David Duke and making it look like it was supposed to be a KKK protest and including white nationalist when in fact David Duke never scheduled  only 40 people showed up with flags the rest were antifa and BLM LIES

638 2018-08-12 22:14:22 Can’t believe people buy KTC coconut oil
639 2018-08-12 22:14:17 I'm convinced they're going to be laughing at us for making everything from oil in the same way we mock them for using lead & asbestos in the past. "Why would they? Look what it did to them! How did they not know?"

We have bn well and truly screwed by this govt. Lie after lie #enoughisenough

650 2018-08-12 22:12:51 At the very least, allow Canadian oil to compete with Saudi oil in the eastern Canadian market on even terms.
651 2018-08-12 22:12:48 Those two are not the only factors that affect $&. In addition to high oil price ($120 pb) & output (2mpd), d cbn stabilized d $ at N180 in 2014 by subsidizing it by close to a N100. The price could hv been N280 to $1 had the currency being floated back then too

654 2018-08-12 22:12:32 Funny that a guy that bilks millions of dollars from ignorant sheep would ever feel the need to invoke “grown ups”. You are a feckless, snake oil salesman that sold out all the values you pretend to promote by backing the most corrupt, sinister president in US history.
655 2018-08-12 22:12:06 Another day, another booth! Today promoting Carrie Kaplan Skincare & the Grassroots Wellness CBD/Hemp Oil Line of Products.... so fun educating Hastings about the benefits of using CBD oil topically as well as orally. #HastingsFlea #CBDoil #HempOil #HealthyLiving #Ageless

658 2018-08-12 22:11:40 I don't see the direct advantage of imposing a space force. Not like there's any oil up there. The direct advantage is that he can funnel tax money into corporations who have no intention of manufacturing a spaceship.

667 2018-08-12 22:09:28 @QuornFoods it’s great that the Cumberland sausages are vegan friendly now but please don’t use palm oil. It’s destroying rainforests and killing animals which as a vegetarian company I thought you’d be against
668 2018-08-12 22:08:57 Ask him to make sure he cleans up the oil splatter
669 2018-08-12 22:08:49 That’s like me saying I’m going to start a go fund me for a new oil truck if we reach 10k I’ll give some money to let’s say “toys for tots” ok guys we got the 10k but I need my truck. So let’s open it for 1 more month so we can get money for these kids.. does that make sense?
670 2018-08-12 22:08:45 So funny but true... When I see what countries like #Qatar and #SaudiArabia are doing with their Crude oil money, I am left to wonder if #Nigeria is selling Coconut oil?

687 2018-08-12 22:06:33 Well, @thisyeardc is our chef, and he makes good sweet potato curry that I think is fairly easy. Also a very simple olive oil pasta sauce that we hope to remember to use more when we're hungry and have minimal pantry supplies.

691 2018-08-12 22:05:07 Thanks. I've recently started going veganish. I love being vegan but have a small list of exceptions like honey, fish oil, sugar and now... When I can't get away from it, cheese. But it'll be seldom. Still no meat.
692 2018-08-12 22:04:50 I agree there will always be a need for oil, but not wasting it out our tail pipe creating more heat then momentum. Tesla have been subsidized by both Republican & Democrats as means to lead the world with new technology. Why do you thing The Us sells it’s refineries to Saudis?
693 2018-08-12 22:04:47 Oil has nothing to do with the current situation. It's still flowing to Canada, and it's never a factor in any dispute due to the world wide impact it might have.

There are reasons for geopolitics beyond morals
703 2018-08-12 22:03:16 Because liberals don’t want the earth drilled for its organic oil. We have so much oil in CA and not much drilling going on.  Look into it.

709 2018-08-12 22:02:39 Please let's not go there ...have never understood why fans can't just enjoy what both guys have done #Nadal #Federer
710 2018-08-12 22:02:28 I know but like it's not a one size fits all formula. Sure it tastes nice and is healthy but if you already have oil pipelines on your face, it'll make it worse  I learned that the hard way

713 2018-08-12 22:02:21 Try eating a spoonful of coconut oil a day. It helps stop the shaking.
714 2018-08-12 22:01:57 Why do we Ally with countries that don't respect human Rights? Why do we support them buying their oil?
715 2018-08-12 22:01:43 "There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up." ~Proverbs 21:20 #Jesus #God #Bible

717 2018-08-12 22:01:39 Politicians are just getting more dumber, reality is Islam and democracy is like water and oil, they don't mix. Hence sharia and democracy are NOT compatible. No wisdom from Canada's PM.
718 2018-08-12 22:01:11 They have masses of oil fields some sold them by Thatcher. They have a sovereign wealth fund.
719 2018-08-12 22:01:03 A sachet of Oil and salt was also added o 
720 2018-08-12 22:01:03 Cooked in good stock with plenty of chopped mint & corriander, preserved lemon and good olive oil, great accompaniment for kebabs or tagine (needs sauce). Even better with pomegranate seeds 
721 2018-08-12 22:00:55 That mean that the Sinopec takeover rumors are true? 1.5 times book plus assumption of debt for public shares and investment agreement to give China guaranteed oil access in next Permian cheaper than BO paid. Makes sense
722 2018-08-12 22:00:48 Actually Kinder Morgan should give their head a shake in adding more oil storage tanks on Burnaby Mountain
723 2018-08-12 22:00:36 Sauteé in butter or olive oil. I like mine with bleu cheese chunks melted across the top. You can modify your oils and toppings accordingly to the limitations of your diet but I think kale is best a little crispy and not raw

729 2018-08-12 22:00:09 I think Trisha was in contact with someone who was abusive to oil wife and wanted to make an exposed video. Oil wife didn’t want her children to be effected in any way so she took everything down. There’s a video by real stream on YT about it
730 2018-08-12 22:00:03 #UKOG #HORSEHILL  Gatwick Gusher is looking good in the race for the Weald Oil ;)
731 2018-08-12 21:59:47 I put a hot rag on my eyes first then used coconut oil and a cotton ball to get them off. It worked I just have a couple that won’t come off but I left it alone for now
732 2018-08-12 21:59:09 When nok is pretty low in the first place, and both oil prices and dollars going up and down like crazy... A meal on a restaurant can cost about the same as a Nintendo Selects game..!
733 2018-08-12 21:59:09 The best hangover cure is poached eggs cooked in coconut oil with lots of orange juice.
734 2018-08-12 21:58:46 After watching Woods play over the last couple of days, people would be better off to just enjoy what Tiger is doing in the here & now and not compare it to his prime years. It's not a fair comparison to make & actually belittles what he is doing and continues to do in 2018.
735 2018-08-12 21:58:46 There's a lot of people saying all will fail if we leave. In truth there will be little difference. E-systems will continue to oil the trade and trading will continue. Movement will continue.
The key facts are we will be in a position to say no to bad things and encourage better.
736 2018-08-12 21:58:30 My wife was the sole representative of a mid range uk oil company in the US. In meetings everyone assumed she was there as a secretary. Duh!
737 2018-08-12 21:58:15 Do you know that Palm Oil Trade is a $28.2B industry? With Malaysia as one of the top exporter ?
738 2018-08-12 21:58:11 When I was in the sauna at the gym today. A man came in and said, “is it okay if I put my oil on?” I said yes. Next thing you know my eyes are burning, it was like that vics stuff but I just sat there in the sauna not wanting to be rude with burning eyes :)
739 2018-08-12 21:58:09 Gravely concerned? You and I will both be dead, and the world will still run on oil. Politics can’t extinguish economics

742 2018-08-12 21:57:53 How are you old enough to be a great-uncle? There must be an oil painting of a really ugly you in someone’s attic somewhere.
743 2018-08-12 21:57:49 so, i'm starting to use coconut oil on my hair today

let us hope for the best uwu
744 2018-08-12 21:57:40 More Neo Liberal corporatist war mongers? Why? We can do better than Joe. Thats just more Incrementalism while bombing other countries for oil. Not raising the min wage. No univ healthcare.
745 2018-08-12 21:57:22 I’ve been taking evening primrose oil tablets and I’ve been noticing a big difference. It’s meant to be a natural aid to reduce acne. You can get them at Lidl! Give them a try and see if it works! X
746 2018-08-12 21:56:33 "A rebellion in the Kurdish region with three/four armed groups fighting the IRGC & enjoying support from the local people is the last thing Iran needs." IRGC is involved in clandestine importation of oil from Kirkuk that travels through the mountain roads of the Kurdish region.

748 2018-08-12 21:56:22 Lord thank you for your mighty work in me. Spending 2 days on my car, fixing oil pump and small little things on my car, but in this process God reveals and gives revelation.  Building  on my character. Lord Ill praise you in every situation. You are still God!
749 2018-08-12 21:56:18 Check out Alta motors and Zero Motorcycles. Both have insane acceleration and cost to drive is 1/10 the cost of petrol+maintenance+oil.

754 2018-08-12 21:55:35 @PutinRF_Eng if there are oil reserves discovered in Pakistan then Russian oil companies should help Pakistan to stand on it's on feet. Who needs imf. Pak can pay off it's debt.
755 2018-08-12 21:55:33 You ignore that they are temporary tariffs to lower them in other countries, like the EU already folded and agreed to by more farm products, and China already folded to oil, next comes farm products. Also Trump subsidized them temporarily.
756 2018-08-12 21:55:20 Astros Leaking oil. This offense could keep us out of the playoffs.
757 2018-08-12 21:55:13 I’d take unstable weather over buying oil from a monarchy that funds terrorism, oppresses women and gays and still tortures people in public for entertainment.

764 2018-08-12 21:53:28 Every other country that has gained independence from their "rulers" have done fine and stood on their own two feet, there is no reason why Scotland can't do the same. Ireland the exact same size and population of us with no oil seems to be doing fine.
765 2018-08-12 21:53:17 I love that you love to be covered in oil, lol

769 2018-08-12 21:52:30 I'm gonna need a citation on too much glucose from whole plant foods rotting organs. Don't consume oil, not hard. If you're not consuming oils and watching what you eat then you don't have to worry about too much omega 6.

1. you should know the price of one egg
2. You should know the price of 1 gallon of oil

Jacket potato. 
I tend to stick to boiled or baked plain carbs. Try and avoid deep or heavily fried foods and oil. 
Stir fry should be fine with safe veg. Ginger, bok choi, spring onion, soy sauce.

783 2018-08-12 21:49:04 I dislike "renewables" as a category. How much of that is ethanol (which is renewable, but pollutes more than oil)?
784 2018-08-12 21:49:00 anybody on the tl add oil to foundation b4? i wanna try it w fenty cuz my skin dry as fuck
785 2018-08-12 21:48:45 Oil
786 2018-08-12 21:48:40 It.. It's raw egg yolks, vinegar and oil. This person needs to calm down wth
787 2018-08-12 21:48:36 It's very low-stakes! Especially if you can get those $1-ish teeny tiny bottles of the oil (which was how I got into this, take up no room travelling & they last me like 6 weeks coz even with this much hair a v tiny bit goes a loooong way)
788 2018-08-12 21:48:35 If we spent our time making games where we’re saving other countries from vast amounts of oil beneath the soil it would be too close to reality.
789 2018-08-12 21:48:32 I'm putting coconut oil on everything. Might just stick a whole coconut in my butthole
790 2018-08-12 21:48:26 @TheeComebackKid why would anyone agree to grapple with her unless there was oil, liqour and a $50 cash prize

793 2018-08-12 21:47:57 The dollar is going higher 

EM countries will devalue their currencies to restore FX reserves by seeking a trade surplus (UST in high demand)

EM high Inflation & high rates (IMF) -> oil crisis as the demand will fade away

The US Shales will be hit hard and the US economy too
794 2018-08-12 21:47:35 Probably factually correct, the money will be heading straight to London. Until we're independent it'll never be our oil
795 2018-08-12 21:47:30 Base that strictly on Twitter would be a miatake, as any fan who knows something about baseball is aware the Blue Jays didn't get close to full value. Again, it was far more than expected but
796 2018-08-12 21:47:25 No soaps. No lotions. Only if it's scented free! But you're better off moisturizing with coconut oil (raw) or Vaseline

799 2018-08-12 21:46:32 me when i realize i have pasta but no butter or parmesan or olive oil in the house
800 2018-08-12 21:46:21 If only there were pipelines to get the oil from where it is at to where it could be sold to and shipped to the world. Why hasn't anyone thought up a solution yet?
801 2018-08-12 21:46:18 did i just send my friends a three minute video talking about frankincense essential oil? yes.

@ArKayngel: “Oh, so just like normal”
805 2018-08-12 21:45:56 @PSG_English YOUR OIL MONEY AIN'T LONG ENOUGH, HOE
806 2018-08-12 21:45:56 I think the point you're missing is that we cannot go back in time & save our own oil revenues. Their current position is a culmination of decisions taken decades ago, plus the per head value of their oil receipts and subsequent revenue is much higher than our own could've be.
807 2018-08-12 21:45:46 Stir together 1/3 cup duck with 9 oz elderberry. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve
808 2018-08-12 21:45:44 Bergamot essential oil is an old school way of relieving anxiety.  Mix some into your favorite hot oil treatment.  Also, try tapping on your wrist when nervous.
809 2018-08-12 21:45:27 You are glowing what is the secret? Don’t say coconut oil 
810 2018-08-12 21:45:26 Think this way, you got lots of oil money, you have no living stress. Why would you critize prince?? They just eat and sleep.
811 2018-08-12 21:45:21 Yes our oil industry thrives on seismic and geological technology developed by US weapons research. I have colleagues in Cambridge who research fracturing techniques because our SNP looney tune government have discouraged it here.
812 2018-08-12 21:45:21 You’re welcome, girl!  Try it out. Plus, I use CeraVe foaming face wash for oil control and bioré scrubs.
813 2018-08-12 21:44:56 Hahahaahahahaaha i remember my dumbass brother would put frozen chicken fajitas in hot ass oil we all knew when he did that because the house smelled like it was burning
814 2018-08-12 21:44:24 By virtue of having vast oil and gas fields which were well managed (by UK and Norwegian firms, I’ll add).  We don’t have those any more.
815 2018-08-12 21:44:20 Gotta get this oil change tomorrow
816 2018-08-12 21:44:12 LOL you know coconut oil with a few drops of tea tree oil & lavender oil massaged into the skin will help if that's acne.
817 2018-08-12 21:44:05 "The whitest and nastiest things in the world cannot be ingested or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
818 2018-08-12 21:43:45 He would when/if he ever got in power. They all do. This has gone on for decades. The U.K. economy would tank without Saudi oil. And there there is the other regional power to counter balance.. Iran.
819 2018-08-12 21:43:39 The US$ has not been backed by Gold since Nixon defaulted on our debts incurred by Guns and Butter. This undermined the whole post-war system. Kissinger forced the Saudi's to price oil in US$ to maintain the reserve currency status of the dollar.  War and terror keep it going.
820 2018-08-12 21:43:25 Not sure where you think this vast oil wealth is.  The North Sea in in closing down mode.  Sure, there’s a little left, but what there is is a small fraction of what we had at the start and expensive to retrieve.  Nowhere near what we’d need to invest.
821 2018-08-12 21:43:20 I tend to mainly fuck with mustard but oil and vinegar is a must on some things.
822 2018-08-12 21:43:14 Scratch, but you can modify box.  I'm not snooty!  I'd just replace part of the liquid it calls for with Coffee and switch butter for part of the oil.
823 2018-08-12 21:42:54 Exactly, that's what it all comes down to at the end of the day - oil. A bunch of neocons controlling the lives of billions of people, all for the aims of their personal greed.
824 2018-08-12 21:42:43 Unless #AAOG strikes Oil in all 4 zones, #RBD & #UPL hit in Wick & #UOG Colter comes up good, I can’t afford buying more players yet
825 2018-08-12 21:42:28 It’s not even that it’s just the texture and the WORK REQUIRED TO REINTEGRATE THE OIL? Unacceptable.
826 2018-08-12 21:42:16 We should & probably could.   Energy East was a powerful vehicle to begin the process of weaning Canada off foreign oil & maximizing the price Canadian oil sells for.   Trudeau killed this option for political gain.   He also killed Northern Gateway & 10s of thousands of jobs.

828 2018-08-12 21:41:32 I woke up to a gigantic MF-ing wolf spider crawling on my arm last night. I immediately murdered that asshole. And today, I’ve sprayed an entire bottle of peppermint oil in my house to run out all of his family and kill them, too. I will not lose this war.
829 2018-08-12 21:41:31 I can't wait to see them! I have them too. I feed birds black oil sunflower seeds, among other things. They and the squirrels do all of the rest. The critters have planted acorn squash, corn, a chestnut tree. Bees/cross pollinators have done their work too!

853 2018-08-12 21:38:43 Standard oil was broken because dominated the market and basically killed all competition,these tech giants are bigger than most countries and have tremendous power,they need to be broken..anti trust now
854 2018-08-12 21:38:42 Rather have the club get money from oil than from feeding school children rancid meat like the rags.
855 2018-08-12 21:38:36 I am ready to sell my oil to America, My face is rich resource of crude oil. @realDonaldTrump can make a billion dollar to me!
856 2018-08-12 21:38:10 I apologise on behalf of my country,I’m disgusted that oil is so frigging important,I’m disgusted my country even trades with them,but worse are Britain and USA ,selling death is too important

858 2018-08-12 21:38:04 Story of how he got SOS is fairy tale; he lobbied using Condi Rice & her firm & Putin wanted him.
If he is so white why human rights abuses? Why use fixers & mercaneries who beaqt, rape & eve killed? OIL. May 2017 in Saudi Rex orchestrated deal for Exxon & was there for signing.
859 2018-08-12 21:38:03 Why do people keep giving this snake oil salesman money??
860 2018-08-12 21:38:01 You know who you should really tip (if it applies)? The guy who pumps your gas.

Sure, gas is crazy expensive, but that guy/gal making minimum wage doesn't benefit from the price of gas.

And I'm talking just for pumping gas. No windshield washes or checking your oil levels.
861 2018-08-12 21:37:57 A population that's a fraction the size of the UK? Plentiful in hydroelectric? Fortunes from oil and gas? Are you trying to make the case fior Scottish independence? Because you just did.
862 2018-08-12 21:37:56 Doctor: Your sugar is high, and your triglycerides too. You're gonna have to diet.
Me: Ok.
Doctor: And you're gonna have to use a glucometer.
Me: Ok.
Doctor: And we'll give you new meds.
Me: Ok.
Doctor: And I'm giving you fish oil pills.
Me: NOOOOOO, GODDAMMIT, FUCK!!!!!
863 2018-08-12 21:37:54 Jeremy, if the UK hadn't been so wasteful with the oil revenue we'd all be in a far better position. Can't you understand why we want to be independent.   WM have been completely inept with the huge revenue that could have been generated
864 2018-08-12 21:37:54 Project Update:
My homemade vinegar-citrus cleaning solution is working great. Now to work on infused olive oil.
865 2018-08-12 21:37:53 the one thing I would splurge on if I were rich is an actual painted portrait of myself, like a gilded frame oil painting for my oil baron study
866 2018-08-12 21:37:16 Sorry, this won't do. A good diet and regular exercise are helpful to maintain good health.  But, are you seriously proposing this stuff to treat, for example, a child with a brain cancer? Are you saying that cannabis oil, exercise and a good diet will cure him or her? Seriously?
867 2018-08-12 21:37:14 And I’m hoping it bounces down to 2-2.2%.. an up trend would be bad.. anywhere near 2 would demonstrate things ‘stabilising’ Fuel increases (not necessarily connected to oil price) may scupper that though
868 2018-08-12 21:37:07 Gotta root for the underdogs. Not all teams can be built out of oil money.
869 2018-08-12 21:37:04 Swapped out my sisters oil pan
Taught my friend how to change his oil
Sawed some books in half for an elementary educator I know
I think it's time for a skyrim break
870 2018-08-12 21:36:59 If all else fails get some good conditioner with some kind of oil like coconut or argan and leave it in your hair under a shower cap for a few hours or overnight. Bonus points for warming it up with a hair dryer on low or medium
871 2018-08-12 21:36:35 Hot cup of hazelnut vanilla coffee  on this lazy Sunday afternoon catching up on my book before the busy start of the week. Later we have to change the oil in the car an wash the kart from last night so I'm soaking it up as much as I can :)
872 2018-08-12 21:36:30 Roasted pecan nuts in coconut oil with Moroccan seasoning topped with grated Sheeze is my new comfort food
873 2018-08-12 21:36:10 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
874 2018-08-12 21:36:02 The politicians are NOT for American Citizens. Lot's of fantastic people living on the Eastern part of the State. Ask @GOPLeader McCarthy that represents the Kern County area. Oil, Ag, & Americana. HOWEVER, the Coastal Elites & politicians want votes/cheap labor. #BuildTheWall
875 2018-08-12 21:36:01 Hey bby. How about you grab that motor oil gurl. @RaineSN7
876 2018-08-12 21:35:52 I thought I could smell baby oil 
877 2018-08-12 21:35:31 Txs. I did read it.
It is obvious the decision of the oil companies were and how to sell.

PS The car was not against the sales, but that the oil companies should have been more open about the effects of burning these fuels.
878 2018-08-12 21:35:25 Mungkin tipe kulitnya berminyak, jadi cleansingnya ganti jangan pake yg oil cleanser. Coba pake micellar water/milk cleanser

882 2018-08-12 21:35:07 Comfort food, even though corned beef with brisket is wrong. 

Also, if you want an awesome summer soup? Fresh peas, a dollop of goats cheese and a touch of black truffle oil.
883 2018-08-12 21:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this August? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
884 2018-08-12 21:35:03 Every single "easy roast 'x'" recipe:

Cover it in olive oil.
Sprinkle on salt and pepper.
Roast at 375 for 90 minutes.

I just saved you all infinite clicks.
885 2018-08-12 21:34:52 The US/Turkey “alliance “ went south the moment Erdogan sided with Iran and vowed to continue buying oil from them despite US sanctions ...
886 2018-08-12 21:34:50 Yeah, what else? Let me guess...by „the Zionists“? CIA? For a pipeline or oil?
887 2018-08-12 21:34:42 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + powders + movies + science! Go!
888 2018-08-12 21:34:36 Skimmed, Semi-Skimmed or Flesh-Eatingly, Oil-Rig-Munchingly Skimmed?
889 2018-08-12 21:34:21 Norway have saved almost all of their oil revenue in a Sovereign fund, it's worth a trillion, which provide the state income and only has a population of 5m. So we can't copy their model Harry.
890 2018-08-12 21:33:58 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
891 2018-08-12 21:33:30 Bite the bullet. Cut off all ties to evil Saudi Arabia. No oil from them and no wheat, food for them. Call the Trumpian Bluff on NAFTA which is just using the Saudis as a negotiating ploy. Be more like Sweden.
892 2018-08-12 21:33:20 oil tanker or some shit right?
893 2018-08-12 21:33:19 Need an oil change, headlights out, car won’t start? Calllll me 
894 2018-08-12 21:33:18 Before meeting Popeye, his girlfriend's full name was Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

I'm sorry.

896 2018-08-12 21:33:00 Let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Cuba. I'll get a good price!
897 2018-08-12 21:32:54 Watching Şükrü Hanioğlu doing his best to pour scholarly oil, in a Turkish television appearance, on the roiling tide of paranoia and recrimination flowing from the state. Poignant.
898 2018-08-12 21:32:54 Well, tbh...being the daughter of a former Tupperware manager, I love adult sippy cups - less spillage for the clumsy - and I'm convinced Starcucks roasts their beans in fish oil & sewerage so ne'er the twain shall meet in my world... 
899 2018-08-12 21:32:41 Dead at "Be Weaved Gritter that tried to slick a can of oil" lol!
900 2018-08-12 21:32:25 If you do buy I suggest buying their oil with it so it’s easier to blend!
901 2018-08-12 21:32:24 Saudis lecture everybody since they don’t work, eat oil money, cozy up with US, UAE and Israel, drink and sleep. Disgrace to humanity...
902 2018-08-12 21:31:56 My engineer dad headed up the bitumen section of Total Oil in South Africa back in the day; he'd have agreed with you 100%
903 2018-08-12 21:31:40 Thank the lord he was teach right. He works on my car when I need an oil change or breaks. He’s a miracle
904 2018-08-12 21:31:29 This is the gov we are talking about and they had a month to do up a cost analysis. They havent been in thw pipeline business or the oil business. Might be a good idea to find out when break even point of project would be if done on time and budget.
905 2018-08-12 21:31:24 my white grandpa is testing his oil with a thermometer and my grandma comes around saying “I never use that thing, water works fine and is free.” I was deadass just thinking that 
906 2018-08-12 21:31:19 《I need oil for my shoulder.》
907 2018-08-12 21:31:09 OMG. PNG is finished. All PNGs forests will be gone. All palm oil now. Everything plundered & profits to Beijing. Australia has been complicit with this.
908 2018-08-12 21:31:02 YEs gold at $1210 is a weird cat right now still no reaction and il is really interesting, IRan and the "challenge" of replacing its oil versus the market funk watching $66.33 in WTI terms
909 2018-08-12 21:30:59 Well, maybe because Trudeau does not want to renogiate NAFTA to get rid of all tariffs in both directions, including oil and oil products Canada needs to import.  As Trump tweeted, progress on NAFTA negotiations with Mexico,... where is Canada??  :D
910 2018-08-12 21:30:49 To save money I make my own hair mask which is a half and half mixture of my everyday hair conditioner which is Dove deep moister and coconut oil and leave it in my hair for 3 days when I wash it out my hair is brand new  I hope this helps you sweetheart

912 2018-08-12 21:30:32 nothing, saudi won't get effected. however,  Canadian economics said lots of money will be left on the table for Canada. Canada, if don't care about the oil then don't buy other sources than yours

Largest Sovereign Wealth fund on planet due to properly managing oil & 1 of strongest currencies. Of course you find it expensive.
919 2018-08-12 21:29:18 father's want to take responsibility for their kids Ex partners and bullshit family courts take the responsibility away from dads
920 2018-08-12 21:29:10 Oh great I got soap on my snack and now it burns..... tea tree oil soap.  Nasty
921 2018-08-12 21:29:05 I really like my Nissan Altima I have 2016 but of course at this point with a choice I would get the 2019. I have had mine since 2016 and have never had a problem with it. It’s great on gas. All of my oil checks, tire rotations, etc have been free. I really don’t have a complaint
922 2018-08-12 21:28:47 It was the bus smash of competition from developing nations, compounded by a breathtakingly short-sighted and rabid British socialism and multiple oil shocks.
923 2018-08-12 21:28:38 < one of his defense jutsus in order to entrap the traitor 

Swiftly as normal, Shadow weaved the hand signs 

With his sub zero kekai genkai known by the Mist as the Yuki clan, Shadow was even able to freeze the oil rain 

"Ice Release: Ice >
924 2018-08-12 21:28:37 Cut Saudi imports — they supply ten percent of Canada’s oil supply.  How to fix the void — energy east. Done. And from what I see Conservatives always choose enegagement over avodidence, unless you are supporting terror (   )
925 2018-08-12 21:28:37 As he witnessed the one jutsu that Shadow recruited Ayaka for in the first place, Toshiro knew just exactly how to counter this Oil rain. 

He anticipated that Ayaka would be so careless and attempt to attack Shadow head on, thus he utilized >
926 2018-08-12 21:28:36 Barely anyone has reaped any benefits from Trump’s economic policies. My wages have stagnated and now health care costs are skyrocketing thanks to Trump and the Republicans doing everything they can to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Trump is selling snake oil.
927 2018-08-12 21:28:04 I been putting coconut oil in my beard every day and LEMME TELL YA IT HAS NEVER BEEN SOFTER
928 2018-08-12 21:28:01 Then explain why your country flew planes into the World Trade Center? You're a terrorist country of sand people. You are trash and need to be put in your place. With move away from oil you willbe a wasteland again soon thankfully. Puppet #Trump can only prop you up so long.
929 2018-08-12 21:27:58 I couldn't hit the heart fast enough on this. Digital art is so just as difficult and requires just as much skill! I caught shut as a a digital major by a few people that it was  SoOoO much harder to use oil. Gtfo with that
930 2018-08-12 21:27:58 meaning if you stop using them regularly you’ll just break out again. as for a toner i would recommend one from origins ( zero oil might b good for u ) and for a moisturizer i use origins original skin !!
931 2018-08-12 21:27:57 1) I think some of our most important fiats is dying. I can not see us buying #oil with #dollar in 10 years. In that scenario only a handfull could continue to buy oil. What is Turkey going to do? If US increases rates the USD gets even stronger.
932 2018-08-12 21:27:54 So, everyone borrows, right. Don't forget the PDP years saw higher prices of crude oil compared to APC, yet they borrow and squandered it. APC is borrowing and we are seeing it working in Npower, railway, agriculture, etc. You can see the difference.
933 2018-08-12 21:27:34 Can't be true. Sir Ian Wood assured as North Sea oil was just about finished. Why would he lie? 
934 2018-08-12 21:27:14 We have oil in Nigeria and we buy fuel #145 per liter what if Nigeria has no oil. What would have been fuel price? I’m sure @atiku would regulate some of these irregularities made in this APC govt. vote for @atiku as president 2019. @Treasure4godsu1 @renoomokri @OfficialPDPNig
935 2018-08-12 21:26:11 there’s more oil in prudhoe bay, alaska than there ever was in Saudi Arabia
936 2018-08-12 21:26:03 When will the fracking stop? This needs ppls attention. "Getting one oil well fracked takes more water than the entire town can drink or use in a day."

942 2018-08-12 21:24:17 Because you'd be the first up in the call to bravery(Yea Right)! If a sitting President ever said "We're going invade the ragheads' oil to better the world of freedom" - you would just have a mental collapse worse that your current world! Your Bonkers! You can't understand race!
943 2018-08-12 21:24:06 Concrete evidence would prove fruitful. Much like us, providing evidence of the cons of fracking...we need to establish a base of trustworthy people, advocating against forthcoming #oilandgas #ecocide on our #planet ~ courtesy of #oil@GheorghiuAndy
944 2018-08-12 21:23:56 Then you know straight out Toronto doesn’t need Saudi oil . What happens when Canada starts building pipelines and starts refusing to sell arms to Saudi ?
945 2018-08-12 21:23:51 for new tweeps, If my tweets seem bipolarish, alternating between A. oil news+ general news mayhem, and B. climate change awareness and developing science for it, it's because A. I traded oil for a long time, before , the rise of EV's, solar power/batteries/clean energies. etc

950 2018-08-12 21:23:12 I have news for you.  The 63+ million of us that voted for him, the tens of millions that have changed their minds to support him are the very people that grow your food, pump you oil, provide your water, truck your goods.

Try it

We will not allow this
951 2018-08-12 21:23:07 Keep the Petrodollar alive and the U.S able to keep exerting influence across the Globe. That is first reason for oil from middle east. Also to have a power Base that will on some levels function alongside Israhell and be there so Israel does not sit there like a Solo player.
952 2018-08-12 21:23:02 @checkupcbc If the Saudis didn't have oil they would be pariahs. We get 10% of our oil from them. Surely we can get that elsewhere. And I don't support selling arms to them or anyone else so losing that business is fine with me!
953 2018-08-12 21:22:53 There are those that argue that Norway is more socialist than Venezuela, certainly oil, gas transport etc are state owned
954 2018-08-12 21:22:45 My wife criticizes my pronounciation of “oil”.  Can’t really spell how I say it but here’s a try...oool. And it doesn’t rhyme with pool or fool.
955 2018-08-12 21:22:43 De Blasio's little more than an enforcer for NYC's various entrenched unions and business cartels, but likes to fantasize about radical Leftist causes
956 2018-08-12 21:22:38 You will bankrupt Nigeria forever with your socialism if the loan programme is not competitive and insured. Promise education reform in general instead of this "dash". Oil will not last forever.

958 2018-08-12 21:22:18 This situation and our problems with the orange monkey across the border is why we need our own refinery We do need oil until we're able to transition to clean energy even beyond
959 2018-08-12 21:22:15 What do you mean "we"? Do you have a mouse in your pocket? Like you tweeted previously, Canada has plenty of oil in the tar sands. Go ahead and stop using Saudi oil. Or do your environmentalists keeping pipelines from being built? How are the NAFTA negotiations going?

There is an episode of @checkupcbc (c2004) where Pat Nelson (then Alberta Minister of Finance) provide a pointed and vitriolic explanation of why Canada does not consume its own oil output. #cccheckup #cdnpoli #abpoli
963 2018-08-12 21:21:11 Oil Baron Boy lmao
964 2018-08-12 21:21:08 The Saudis create the surface veneer of tolerance and democracy but are a feudalistic medieval theocratic society at their core. Yes, JP... end oil dependence and, importantly, arms sales!
965 2018-08-12 21:21:04 Mighty men of the master race look like the goofy fucks at the oil change place. You know, the ones in the pit that aren't allowed to speak to customers? Except for the ones in polo shirts, they work at the Heritage Foundation.
966 2018-08-12 21:20:50 I’ll buy anyone who wants to come with me to get it oil change after work tomorrow a Slurpee

978 2018-08-12 21:19:35 Another link in there to Exxon Mobile. Why are we giving money to oil companies. It seems Malcolm is spreading our money between his mates with gay abandon and no scrutiny. We really need an ICAC while we still have some money. By the time he is voted out we will be bankrupt

981 2018-08-12 21:18:34 Wait people never had Oil and Vinegar on a sandwich before? That's all Italian Dressing is with some herbs mixed it. Man that sucks for ya.
982 2018-08-12 21:18:19 Is there an oil shortage in Canada that I'm unaware of?
983 2018-08-12 21:18:11 This is the moment. 

With some of the other guys around him leaking oil, Tiger has 5 or so feet for birdie at 12, and to tie for 2nd.

I don’t want to say “must-make”, because a lot can happen...but if he makes, it can sure change the whole complexion of this thing.

986 2018-08-12 21:17:34 It really bugs me when people say naturopaths are all about probiotic vodka and SoulCycle. We're not that simple. We also like oil pulling.
987 2018-08-12 21:16:37 As a vet, I say: tar and feather the recruiters. And get it through these pin-headed volunteers to be mercenaries for the oil companies that if EVERYBODY HAD SINGLE-PAYER, they’d be fine. But whadda I know? I’m just one of those dumb young kids - WHO DOESN’T LIE TO HERSELF.
988 2018-08-12 21:16:06 Oh,  and oil doesn't? Please.

990 2018-08-12 21:15:57 @nextofficial I've got your Summer Sun Body Mist & Shimmer Oil. Mist comes out in big wet splashes, not a mist. Do I have a faulty spray?
991 2018-08-12 21:15:57 Iraq was invaded over the Petrodollar. Bush used the, "weapons of mass destruction" as an excuse. Hussein wanted to sell Iraq's oil in Euros, which would have destroyed the value of the $US as the Worlds oil trade currency. Same reasons with Libya & Qaddafi. Syria also (pipeline)
992 2018-08-12 21:15:55 How's my Sunday going you may ask? Well found out I had a botched oil change and now its costing me $1,800. But I'm thankful for friends so I got that going for me at least. @atleyjnugent23

997 2018-08-12 21:15:22 If we would to cut ties the price of oil in the US would sky rocket. It would put millions out of a job.

You gotta weigh up the pros and cons.

How about we just threaten them instead? behave or we'll level your country and take your oil?
998 2018-08-12 21:15:19 My sermon this morning is really bad...is there an Essential Oil for that? @Rev_Norespect
999 2018-08-12 21:15:14 Trump promised these people that he would get Carrier to stay, and keep those jobs in the US. It was a lie, Carrier shut down the plant, shipped the jobs to another country. I feel bad for these people, but they couldn’t see through the 4 time bankrupt snake oil salesman?

1002 2018-08-12 21:14:54 I totally understand. You should check with your doctor first before adding anything new. That's Awesome that your labs are good. I would rather educate someone on something that could help. I never push my products on anyone. I just wish I knew about CBD Oil before my mom died.

1005 2018-08-12 21:13:55 They also have a $900bn oil fund since they invested their oil boom wealth from the state oil company.  In the 80s the Tories pissed ours away on tax cuts that actually led to a recession. Only WM could pull that one off.
1006 2018-08-12 21:13:48 My man changed my oil, washed the outside of my car and cleaned the inside for me today. How’d I get so lucky? 
1007 2018-08-12 21:13:41 Compared with gasoline, diesel is less energy intensive to produce from crude oil.   We should be using cleaner diesel in cars as well as trucks...like Europe

1011 2018-08-12 21:13:27 So the more inequality the more growth? That's a very silly argument. As for the iphone - study the industry and you'll understand that something like it was inevitable. It's like saying no one would have ever figured out how to put olive oil in a bottle.

1018 2018-08-12 21:12:55 @Rachael_Hodges cannabis oil has shown great results on all levels of cancer (1-4). Research, research, research! Do not consider conventional medicine as the only viable treatment. Organic food, essential oils, sleep - matt walker's book 'why we sleep' - insightful, jawdropping!
1019 2018-08-12 21:12:34 Yes, but the US couldn't let the Saudi government fall for fear that something far worse would gain control of all that oil wealth + I'm sure that Russia would love to become the Saudi protector.

1028 2018-08-12 21:11:57 How to face the arrogant President..?!  Trump has no more alias Canada, 
Mexico and EU (with fear) and Turkey. His competitors (Russia and China )are doing their share to face him. May be to the abandon the Dollar/Oil.

1032 2018-08-12 21:10:54 Wat do u mean by lots of water?do u mix water with coconut oil?
1033 2018-08-12 21:10:54 I legitimately have alarms set for every hour so I remember to have a glass of water, every hour. I also have been putting oil free acne wash on my breakout areas for two weeks. If I have a pimple at the concert I’m going to scream.
1034 2018-08-12 21:10:52 No it requires liberated oil from the middle east and like...8 indictments
1035 2018-08-12 21:10:46 Their $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund created by not selling off their oil and gas companies helps as well, also a very small population makes things easier to manage.  I wish I was Norwegian.
1036 2018-08-12 21:10:35 Why did u new school clothes but the current song at IHOP. There's a bunch of my essential oil diffuser
1037 2018-08-12 21:10:29 I really slept on that @fentybeauty Fenty foundation! The a/c was out at my weekend gig & Ms Fenty Beauty did not clock out hunni! Outside of a little oil in the T zone ya girl was flawless for all 7 hours  #NewFav
1038 2018-08-12 21:10:26 Did it with a. whole food plant based diet with no added oil. Simple, lost a lot of weight and lowered my carbon footprint, all while getting healthy.

1040 2018-08-12 21:10:18 You can keep your effing snake oil pyramid scheme just like the last 4 decades of people who's modern miracle cure would "totally" fix me. I have been living in this body for approximately 376,000 hours. What kind of expert are you? #makingfriends
1041 2018-08-12 21:10:16 But you're right that all that is beyond Canada's control so stopping Canada-Saudi oil trade would just be virtue signalling.

1045 2018-08-12 21:09:52 It is great news, Erdogan was robbing oil from Syria, sending militants to fight with ISIS - still they will never leave NATO or remove american bases on their soil.
1046 2018-08-12 21:09:51 @MrNickKnowles oh the possibilities are endless for a guessing game! What kind of : beard oil , peel of mask, cleanser, moisturiser ............
1047 2018-08-12 21:09:42 Imagine Gavin liking his coffee strong and dark like oil, and Nines with the affinity for cream and sugar. :'^)
1048 2018-08-12 21:09:17 True to some extent, but in fact money is not infinitely fungible. If Saudi wants to sell oil to *any* country dependent on the western banking system, they do so because the US gov't lets them. Why that is, I suspect, is worry about strategic value of oil / China / Russia / etc.
1049 2018-08-12 21:09:15 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

1051 2018-08-12 21:09:03 Riiight,

Reduced regs to increase H2O & Air pollution, lessen safety on oil rigs, allow big banks to screw consumers.

Wages are STAGNANT

Small biz creates more jobs, taxed at 5% HIGHER than big biz. Must not donate to Congress as much.

GOP steals $537 BILLION from Medicare!
1052 2018-08-12 21:08:49 If you're still there, please inform the guy that humans do not drink sea-water, and forcing more oil by rail, through river valleys is not helpful. 2, Doing this for FN? Hardly. I rather have $400 million going directly to our FN communities.. this is why we (FN) mainly approve.
1053 2018-08-12 21:07:43 Wow and people say Americans don't understand soccer! Material team owned by oil barrons & Human right abusers that are involved in the worst of sports. Worst team Man City, Worst GP Abu Dhabi

1059 2018-08-12 21:06:53 In the frying pan. I marinated it with paprika, cumin, garlic powder, salt, pepper and a bit of brown sugar. Used a bit of olive oil in the pan. Broccoli is steamed and I made jasmine rice.
1060 2018-08-12 21:06:50 Toxic masculinity to white men: real men don't moisturize, they bath their hands in engine oil, beer, or blood of their enemies. Also, use bar soap or body wash not shampoo and conditioner.
1061 2018-08-12 21:06:50 oh dat reminds me oil is going to blast on monday upward..
1062 2018-08-12 21:06:36 Bacon/cheddar in two and the other 2 4cheese and regular but use anything. I added some oil and spices but smoked for an hour at 180-200 with summer shanty pellets.
1063 2018-08-12 21:06:20 laughable,the oil industry is a small portion of th u.s economy, and their economy is well due to tax breaks introduced by
@realDonaldTrump administration, many businesses repatriation $ and reinvesting at home, no disrespect but your geopolitical amd economic kwldge is meagre
1064 2018-08-12 21:06:18 That is the same guy from @cnn who last week was blasting Trump for attacking the media.  Now @CNN is blasting their competition.  Freaking hypocrites.

1067 2018-08-12 21:05:41 we could but the environmentalist that run the democratic party in the US and the parties in power in canada. keep that from happening. both our countries have enough oil in the ground to run the world for 100s of years. but the left has said they would rather deal with them
1068 2018-08-12 21:05:29 i do my oil changes myself though.. #vroomvroombitch 
1069 2018-08-12 21:05:20 The truth is it's a mutually beneficial relationship and we have no real incentive to cut ties or search for alternative fuels. As long as we get oil at substantial rates, decent prices, and the princes keep getting wealthier nothing will change.
1070 2018-08-12 21:05:03 Thats #horseshit. #Canada, the creator nation of the United Nations has a long history of standing up for human rights and sending our military into harms way for humanitarian issues and unlike the #USA which tends to follow oil. That's why we didnt join you in Vietnam and Iraq2.
1071 2018-08-12 21:05:00 We do not use palm oil. We use 100% natural cold pressed sunflower oil 
1072 2018-08-12 21:04:43 DSA disregards the deficit because the working class has yet to recover from the 2008 recession, especially in the wake of a class warfare tax cut. Dick Cheney's deficit rhetoric was motivated by short-term oil profits and a hard-on for siccing our war machine on foreigners.
1073 2018-08-12 21:04:40 do i buy this oil to get rid of scars and some makeup with it OR clothes ugh i hate decisions
1074 2018-08-12 21:04:40 Saudia Arabia will be allowed to get awy with whatever it wants aslong as its friendly to US/Isreali oil interests
1075 2018-08-12 21:04:22 You people wouldn't know because NONE of you were alive back then. Oil was high, Inflation was high. 1974 there was a nationwide truckers strike,AMF owned Harley, and put out shit bikes. Car workmanship was shoddy.
1076 2018-08-12 21:04:13 If you mention that, I'll need you to answer these questions:
-Was it PMB that depleted our foreign reserves?
-Was it PMB that made our economy to be oil dependent?
-Was it PMB dat prevented Nigeria from saving during the oil boom?
-Was it PMB dat caused the oil prices to slump?
1077 2018-08-12 21:04:08 HATE girls who are just up their own arses, you’re no oil painting hun x pipe down x x fuck off x XX x x

1085 2018-08-12 21:03:12 The amount of misery and suffering that would be reduced if we got rid of oil and gas would completely change our world. Conservatives think it’s dumb to have renewable energy but the second gas hits $4 or you lose power they start bitching
1086 2018-08-12 21:03:12 Rosser landscaping new Truck got a icon leveling kit with fox shocks, a new Ranch Hand front bumper and L.E.D. Headlights! We are covert lucky to be able to service all of their vehicles from oil changes to major engine work!
1087 2018-08-12 21:02:53 Wish I had it 7-8 years ago when a damned oil truck tipped over in front of me and blocked the exit I just managed to get on to for like 5-6 hours.

1089 2018-08-12 21:02:15 Probably cause they have a lot of oil and if US won't buy it from them, someone else will.
1090 2018-08-12 21:02:15 I need to get me oil change this week
1091 2018-08-12 21:02:13 Black oil, is totally different from fresh oil. Low oil level, is different from correct amount of oil. No oil, will cause an engine to overheat, lock up and/or burn up.  #Mechanic101 #SpiritualWalk101

1112 2018-08-12 20:59:30 We used to know this. We used to call it the Ottoman Empire. We used to know the Crusades were a reaction to more than 100 million deaths... but then the Middle East discovered Oil in the 70's, and now we have these clips in the beginning,

1115 2018-08-12 20:59:02 Also, people in some provinces have been told they have to pay a little more for O/G products for enviro-conscience reasons. You’d think paying a little more for Canadian oil because of human rights reasons would fit in well with Lib/NDP ethos.
1116 2018-08-12 20:58:54 We've got oil. F*** Saudi Arabia.

1119 2018-08-12 20:58:45 CHINA HAS REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL

WHY ISN'T THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT'S A BIG WIN FOR PRES TRUMP?
1120 2018-08-12 20:58:26 I mean, I'm 35 and I'd sooner have motor oil on my sandwich than mayo.
1121 2018-08-12 20:58:04 period!! garlic n olive oil lil salt
1122 2018-08-12 20:58:03 yes. they believe if the animal suffers, the meat will be better. this is just the tip. next comes skinning alive in order to cause suffering. then boiling in oil or water. 15 min to death. that's what's happening here. help to stop it. speak out,

1124 2018-08-12 20:57:50 you “cant” melt oil pastels with a “lighter” because it will start a “fire”
1125 2018-08-12 20:57:40 Succin down poppers like it's essential oil therapy
1126 2018-08-12 20:57:36 Since money and oil are fungible, this would make almost zero difference outside of virtue signaling.
1127 2018-08-12 20:57:30 Also if you don’t have one of the ingredients it doesn’t matter. Just add slightly more of another. (Replace avo with banana, or coconut oil with more olive oil). Honey is just to open the hair follicle but most people have that.
1128 2018-08-12 20:57:30 White that is full of palm oil
1129 2018-08-12 20:57:26 Use a homemade clay mask, apple cider vinegar toner, & jojoba oil to moisturize daily. Once you start seeing results you can use the mask 2-3x a week. Jojoba oil unclogs pores & reduces excessive sebum production.
1130 2018-08-12 20:57:22 Oh please. The recent decision to take PAC money from oil companies is yet one more example of why a new generation of leaders is needed. You want Millennials’ support? Then hand over leadership to the next generation.
1131 2018-08-12 20:57:17 well, it's certainly something for @lisamurkowski to think about when allowing the forward motion of Pebble Mine in @SaveBristolBay. Some people have forgotten the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill... Such a tragedy.
1132 2018-08-12 20:57:09 @FENNERGY 
First step to knowing makeup and you is to know your skin and where your face produces oils. 
 
 This is easy. 
You will need:
2 large coffee filters 
1 healthy day (can't be sick it will make too much oil and sweat)

1133 2018-08-12 20:56:52 I only really have hair on the fronts of my legs  but yes I’ve heard good things about aldi’s oil - good for the dog too so I’ll get double!
1134 2018-08-12 20:56:51 5-0 is like 35-0 with this philles offense. Against a rookie too. Arrieta leaking oil. Phillies defense as Franco now that ball. Hard to believe Phillies drop 2 of 3 to lowly padres.

1137 2018-08-12 20:56:33 I legit thought they were rubbing oil on your arm. Then I see it was foundation.  Fantastic match!
1138 2018-08-12 20:56:29 My apartment smells like tea tree oil & I have no idea why.
1139 2018-08-12 20:56:24 Coconut oil 2tbs, olive oil 1tbs, banana (1/3 of a banana) honey 1tsp, avocado (1/4 of the avo), 1 egg yolk and everything. Put in blender, leave on for 20 mins. It keeps for about a week. You’ll be shocked at the results, no joke.
1140 2018-08-12 20:56:18 We don’t need oil money anymore
1141 2018-08-12 20:56:13 Uh, it lets us by cheap oil?  This seems like a question with a pretty obvious answer.
1142 2018-08-12 20:56:10 Not often enough. Should be weekly. But I use castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil and whatever deep conditioner is best for your hair. I use kinky curly stellar strands.
1143 2018-08-12 20:56:04 I don't know. One of our junior staff members nearly blew her head gasket because she didn't know that the oil light coming on was Importnat and means "feed me oil or i will kill your engine"
1144 2018-08-12 20:56:03 Why does it seem we are trying to get our oil to a port so that it can easily be shipped away?
1145 2018-08-12 20:55:56 it’s s well orchestrated plan to destroy Tesla . Shorts are used in the process . Behind is oil and auto industry
1146 2018-08-12 20:55:50 Automated oil rigs: Mind blowing to my working class mind. 

Never heard of them on TV.

"...they're called “Iron Roughnecks” and they automate the extremely repetitive task of connecting drill pipe segments to each other as they’re shoved deep into the Earth" @scottsantens
1147 2018-08-12 20:55:45 Since early 2000's Russia got about 5+ trillion USD just for oil and gas!  Do you have any idea where did the money go?  There are a few wealthy people and insane amount of poverty like you have never seen before...
1148 2018-08-12 20:55:37 2017 Tax reform legislation cut the Corporate tax Rate to 21% and cut taxes of 90% of all Americans. This increased employment in numerous industries across America. Decreased regulations increased employment in the Oil and Materials industries. The USA oil producing jobs grown.
1149 2018-08-12 20:55:19 Someone at advanced autoparts just called me stupid for asking for a certain type of oil that I always get for my car, then sold me some oil that would’ve fucked up my engine for 3x the price. Thnx @AutoAdvanced
1150 2018-08-12 20:55:18 Furthermore, mayo itself can be constructed with exactly three ingredients—vegetable oil, vinegar and egg yolk—all of which are about as basic to nutrition as is possible, and none of which ever did anything to you.

-sleep with a humidifier 
-take lukewarm showers/bathes 
-oatmeal bathes( i actually tried this and it reallyyyy works)
-use a thick & creamy moisturizer
1153 2018-08-12 20:54:49 International oil markets don't work that way  (which I'm confident you already know).
1154 2018-08-12 20:54:40 I’m well aware conscious oil purchasing isn’t a thing. Again, why does the cost difference between AB and KSA matter when Singh is talking about buying oil from another country altogether?
1155 2018-08-12 20:54:39 She needs hemp oil very powerful remedy for all cancers. PM me if u interested ..
1156 2018-08-12 20:54:35 Irving can swap out the 11% Saudi oil with East Coast offshore oil - it's local and doesn't need a cross-country pipeline
1157 2018-08-12 20:54:25 Because diversity cabinet has decided that using our own oil is sexist?
1158 2018-08-12 20:54:15 Black soap, rose water, shea butter and macadamia oil. Essentials.
1159 2018-08-12 20:54:12 Meanwhile, over in normal fandom...

Game: This is the heroine! She--
Players: Can I punch her?
Game: Wait, what?
Players: She looks mean. I bet she made a mistake once, so she must actually be evil. I wanna boil her in hot oil.
Game: Oh my god what is wrong with you.
1160 2018-08-12 20:54:05 I liked her at first, compared to the other dough heads in cabinet.  She had that 'new car smell'.  Now, the steering is faulty, she burns a lot of oil, and her suspension is sagging.  I think she needs to go into the shop (back benches).
1161 2018-08-12 20:53:51 I have to assume the Saudi news was premature and stealing EM's thunder, so he had to chime in and take it back. 

Just speculation: Saudi's wanted an off-market issue, EM hesitated, Saudis went public.

Saudi's want diversification away from oil, maybe Gigafactory, jobs, etc.
1162 2018-08-12 20:53:38 whenever I read a recipe that calls for an obvious exorbitant amount of oil, I like to yell “this ain’t mcdonalds binch!” at it and only use a small fraction
1163 2018-08-12 20:53:26 Cod liver oil capsules. Pop them (no seriously) and pour the contents on the cuticles. Heals them right up.

1173 2018-08-12 20:51:19 @checkupcbc This row with Saudi Arabia may lose the election for the NDP because leader Singh had said we need another foreign  source for oil. He thus insults Alberta and Newfoundland which have cheaper and more secure oil in Canada
1174 2018-08-12 20:51:19 Yep. The burning bits in the oil burn whether there’s a little or a lot of them. The amount of smoke might decrease.
1175 2018-08-12 20:51:11 Thought experiment for you: identify one drop of oil that was purchased because it was more "ethical" than another? Oil purchased for geopolitical reasons doesn't count. Go.
1176 2018-08-12 20:51:09 Lots of oil on the track from Ty Dillons car.
1177 2018-08-12 20:51:03 many thanks to @maravjosa putting me onto this DIY oatmeal + honey + coconut oil mask as it’s relieved my contact dermatitis after one application 
1178 2018-08-12 20:50:55 Pretty much, yes.

Many years ago, somebody famously described rooting for the Yankees to be like rooting for Standard Oil.
1179 2018-08-12 20:50:25 Do you even know why the assets were frozen in the first place? It’s not our money. Much of the frozen cash includes Iran's income from selling a limited amount of oil prior to the lifting of the sanctions, when Iran could legally sell oil but could not transfer the money back
1180 2018-08-12 20:50:17 Wow no Oil of oregano.....this stuff is amazing!
1181 2018-08-12 20:49:53 It does!! I try everything I can to help it like Biotin, castor oil and Volume shampoos. To try and help it as much as I can. I hate to think about 10 years from now how it may be.
1182 2018-08-12 20:49:15 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
1183 2018-08-12 20:49:14 The Almond facial lotion is lovely and light but you may benefit most from the facial oil which is super fine and soaks in fast so doesn’t feel at all ‘greasy’. The Almond cleanser is amazing. For the body the baby derma white mallow body lotion is gorgeous, with coconut.
1184 2018-08-12 20:49:07 If you’re comfortable living that way, do the mechanics a favor. Clean it out before the oil change, clean it out before the brake job Etc.

1189 2018-08-12 20:48:29 What about cannabis oil? What does it do? How is it a solution to cancer? What evidence exists for its use? Happy to accept links to published evidence of properly conducted RCTs, biophysical evidence, not anecdote.
1190 2018-08-12 20:48:14 Get EU out of GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon to steal oil and gas. LIBERTY  AND FREEDOM. REFERENDUM solves the GENOCIDE.
1191 2018-08-12 20:48:12 They’re welcome to buy our oil & gas, in exchange for lowering tariffs
1192 2018-08-12 20:48:10 Oh okay! & you’ve seen progress? & do you do a lot of coconut oil or just a few drops?
1193 2018-08-12 20:48:09 It’s going to be a long cleanup. They can’t get the oil cleanup down.
1194 2018-08-12 20:48:09 Apparently drivers were seeing whatever that debris was before Ty Dillon hit it. #NASCAR 

Kurt Busch- "I didn't want to radio it in but there was something laying in lane 2. The oil starts right where that was. It looked like a spring rubber."
1195 2018-08-12 20:48:04 @NASCARonNBC @JeffBurton you need to Stop saying what all it broke on the 13 car until you know, you say oil line, water line, You Don't Know, so say it broke something until you Know What It Broke.
1196 2018-08-12 20:47:57 I switched from olive oil a couple of years ago. it's not the fats, it's the sugars...
1197 2018-08-12 20:47:53 Don't expect the BBC or any Unionist tool to be held to account. The stakes are way too high for the UK. An ind Scotland with Oil and North Sea not under English control is as they say, a clear and present danger to the security of England. They'll use any measures necessary

1202 2018-08-12 20:47:17 alright. he's undoubtedly a scumbag, but that doesn't warrant censorship. being a con artist and selling snake oil should not be punished by censorship. even retards deserve freedom of speech, because if they don't, daddy government gets to decide who's retarded and who isn't
1203 2018-08-12 20:47:13 Chef Skinner cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with grass.

This life is not a bed of roses ,you can't just always get what you want...
I just wish...
1212 2018-08-12 20:45:55 Yes because their elected leader wouldn't let BP plunder their oil riches. And the CIA helped to help our oil companies. In what world is it ok for us to topple sovereign nations?
1213 2018-08-12 20:45:52 Maybe. I am from NYC and Rudy has always been greedy and unprincipled. Trump could have promised to cut him into one of his Russian oil deals.
1214 2018-08-12 20:45:52 It’s called Kalamatas calamity !! Plenty olive oil in the desert , plenty Camels , plenty oasis , the only way you will gain all these olives back is if you win peace with Israel !! Look at Egypt they ve got the whole of Sinaii , inch by inch !

1217 2018-08-12 20:45:41 Unreal. Why are we buying oil off these fools? @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh
1218 2018-08-12 20:45:26 Oil blends are not for smoke point or better cooking. You use oil blends because you want a little olive oil flavor without paying for 100% olive oil.
1219 2018-08-12 20:45:10 I was in kitchen, I had the cable in one hand and a glass in the other, i legit didn't notice it was dipping in the oil

1221 2018-08-12 20:45:03 USSR alliances: Iraq, Syria, Egypt (Nasser), South Yemen and later Afghanistan. US had to back Saudi partly because of oil, but also because ME was a game of Cold War Chess. Hope this explains some. (Really a lot more involved)
1222 2018-08-12 20:45:02 And pls don't give me the BS on climate hoax, fresh from GOP/Trump/Big Oil disinformation machines.  I've been thru Calif wildfires, 3rd year running.

3) We should stop buying oil from them.
1225 2018-08-12 20:44:28 Everything you've cited here is good. I would like to see more. Where does she stand on...

NATO vs. Russia?
Supporting Israel -- the country, not Netanyahu?
Standing up to the oil nations?
Infrastructure?

I'm presuming she'd favor the same kind of Supreme Court Justices as me.
1226 2018-08-12 20:44:23 Back to basics , Green Tea + Calamine + Coconut oil = happy gogo.
1227 2018-08-12 20:44:19 No, they don't have enough to make up for that plus most Canadian oil is lower quality and is already shipped to the US refineries.

1249 2018-08-12 20:40:11 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1250 2018-08-12 20:39:47 We enjoy the heat. Canada also has 20% of the world’s fresh water. You can’t drink oil.
1251 2018-08-12 20:39:36 America: Drones villages, promotes brutal regimes, puts oil interests over human lives, funds terrorists

Conservatives: “THEY HATE US FOR OUR FREEDOM!”

1253 2018-08-12 20:39:25 Venezuela..  The country that hedged its entire treasury on the price of oil? That’s what happen to Alaska if it were its own country..
1254 2018-08-12 20:39:18 Does your check engine light comes on if you need an oil change?

1256 2018-08-12 20:39:11 Almond oil. Massage it into your cuticles. Oil mill mess up your manicures tho so perhaps take a break from color for s minute.
1257 2018-08-12 20:39:03 Because oil? How much of Saudi money is in US banks?
1258 2018-08-12 20:38:57 I’m gonna drown my sorrows in jojoba oil brb.

CBD oil?
1260 2018-08-12 20:38:17 It’s also chuffing expensive, has a population that is a fraction the size of the UK and it is plentiful in hydroelectric power, saved a fortune from oil and gas finds.  That can never work in the UK.  But then Corbyn is economically and strategically illiterate. #CorbynMustGo
1261 2018-08-12 20:37:42 Making more Margherita pizza which I will once again drown in olive oil.
1262 2018-08-12 20:37:18 I like salad, peppers, spring onion, feta,  little bit of olive oil,  seasoning.

1272 2018-08-12 20:35:42 You have to go decades back in history. ME has always been a chessboard. Old USSR always wanted to gain control/influence over oil producing countries in the region and some of this attitude still lingers around
1273 2018-08-12 20:35:29 No One, NOTHING w\ similar Chemistry is immune. Use of Poppy Seed Oil traces back to Ancient Babylon (way before Alexandre Whooped that arse) through today. People w\ CP deserve Treatment bc it's Morally & Ethically Necessary.
Anyone suffering from ANY ILLNESS deserves Treatment

1278 2018-08-12 20:34:44 Main M6.4 earthquake was located about 10 km (6 miles) depth, so very unlikely to be related to any drilling activity. It was also far from the zone of active oil extraction.
1279 2018-08-12 20:34:31 Change the oil every 100 miles. Go to the doctor. Watch TV. Take naps.
1280 2018-08-12 20:34:20 Maybe if I actually did my work on the weekends I wouldn't have to burn the midnight oil but idiots do idiotic things
1281 2018-08-12 20:34:07 Mine are pure pimples. Blackheads and those hard white heads mostly. My face pumps out about a gallon of oil a day. I've been fighting them for 44 years now.

1288 2018-08-12 20:33:11 Terror and the threat of terror has been used to radicalise Jews in Israel and it has now been used as a template to spread fear of Islam around the world.
Muslim after Muslim country bombed and decimated to control their oil and resources via the false flag of staged terrorism.
1289 2018-08-12 20:32:56 Khan saab the kind of position you are in, no one ever had such a majority in the history of kpk..you should burn your midnight oil to completely change the lives of the kpk masses.

1293 2018-08-12 20:32:06 Burberry is a company, not a country or a trading block.  You have a better point with OPEC or at least you did if it was the 1970s, these days OPEC tends to cut its price to try and make other forms of oil extraction less viable.

1301 2018-08-12 20:30:24 “...Alberta oil for pennies...”?  Up until our primary customer started producing more oil than they need, we got good market value for our oil. 

If you’re talking about refining - it isnt cost effective - the margins are too low to justify building new refineries.

1323 2018-08-12 20:27:05 Government could speed up mining and oil and gas laws. Might give them something to put into the fund!
1324 2018-08-12 20:27:01 It’s nice going from a car that needs an oil change every 3k miles and cost $90 to a car that needs it every 5k and costs $21. Wow.
1325 2018-08-12 20:26:53 Hey - you can tweak it.  Substitute coffee for some of the liquid they call for - butter instead of oil.  Easy Peasy!  It'll be good.
1326 2018-08-12 20:26:50 I would like to see a definition of clean and ethical oil. Is it anything like clean coal?

1385 2018-08-12 20:17:56 No 
First the lawsuits were originated by the city councils. So if you don't agree, please refer to them.
Second the court car read about the fact that #ExxonKnow.
So that the oil firms did know if the consequences but didn't act.

1389 2018-08-12 20:17:01 No. islam wasnt the guiding force behind it the number system was of arbic and arabic is not an ilamic upbringing as it was around before islam was around. Do not connect religion with science it is oil and water!
1390 2018-08-12 20:16:59 Wow! I feel like hugging you so much that I’m a python! Sorry if you don’t like snakes! I have all this, too!! Yayyyy! The word? Oil. Just as it’s been the past how many years....WEve been trying to look forward. CHINA will, EU yes, SArabia some see divest..
1391 2018-08-12 20:16:57 Because your anointing oil is rich and heavy; and your walk is holy, righteous, and true in God, don't expect itching ears come calling. #DontDoubt #RemainFaithful2Him
1392 2018-08-12 20:16:43 Yes! :) (Not sure if the scent oil only or do fur-scent samples.)
1393 2018-08-12 20:16:43 I believe most of the people in Norway are quite happy with their nationalized oil industry. I would call Norway a free country. 

Do you think Norway is treading down the dangerous path to communism? Do you think the ’many countries’ you mention are?
1394 2018-08-12 20:16:39 I am sad to announce that Damn Daniel has died. He was struck by debris after an explosion on an oil drilling rig. He was 31.
1395 2018-08-12 20:16:35 @checkupcbc Canada should boycott Saudi Arabia oil and build the Canada East pipeline to distribute oil from Alberta at lower cost to consumers
1396 2018-08-12 20:16:31 Believe me Canada would be fine if SA  cut all economic ties with us.. pull your interest out of our wheat and stop shipping us oil... I assure you we’ll be fine
1397 2018-08-12 20:16:28 But he would rather eat his fist than drop those tariffs. Subsidies are tariff through the back door, which the farmers, forestry, steel and oil industries won’t let go of their large share of that free $300BB easily.
1398 2018-08-12 20:16:27 Them dey craze. For this kind cold. Person no go change oil? Abah.!

1401 2018-08-12 20:16:00 It’s also a good example of understanding user requirements in agile. Swap the oil for sugar and you might wind up putting a fried egg on a meringue.
1402 2018-08-12 20:15:51 Well the recipe HAS changed! Never had Palm Oil, Shea and Coconut fats in it before the Americans stepped in! #gonedownhill

1409 2018-08-12 20:14:33 I know, right?! I can’t stand how every beverage in any store has at least 5-15 grams of sugar per bottle of said beverage. I’m a water guy. Especially having to take so many meds. Flush them out as best I can. Even use coconut oil to “pull” those toxins. Cheers to water people!
1410 2018-08-12 20:14:15 I'm sure people in Saskatchewan think that is just fine. They have oil/ gas too. It's all about money.

1413 2018-08-12 20:13:46 Do you know the ph of your skin care product? Our skin has a protective layer aka the acid mantle at about 5.5 so to balance the skin, products should be ideally between 4.5-5.5. Jojoba oil mimicks the natural oils of your skin.

1416 2018-08-12 20:13:24 ...And if oil is the main reason, shame on us! Saudi Arabia was the source of most of the 9/11 terrorists, and it continues to promulgate  the Wahhabi brand of Islam that feeds Al Qaeda and ISIS...
1417 2018-08-12 20:13:01 Without oil we wouldn't have plastic stir sticks we all use to stir our hot beverages. Do you want that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
1418 2018-08-12 20:12:50 Thought— Polyhexians live in the oil swamps of cybertron and are adapted for that. Including having squishy jelly eggs like frogs. 

Anyway Jazz filled with said squishy eggs.
1419 2018-08-12 20:12:46 you can add other ingredients to it aswell,trying toadd oil to spoonfuls is impossible
1420 2018-08-12 20:12:20 Translation: We need the oil because the big oil companies won’t research alternative energy

1423 2018-08-12 20:11:22 I learned that the most important thing for your skin is a good moisturizer! I never used it, and my skin would stay so oily. I’ve been using an oil free SPF 30 moisturizer for oily/acne prone skin. It’s helped me! Every time you wash your face put moisturizer on afterward.

1444 2018-08-12 20:08:02 Ppl want to remain healthy so my advice to them ..eat food of same quality as you use oil in yr car or bike .
1445 2018-08-12 20:08:00 Ouuu. A lot actually. Aloe Vera. Black soap. Coconut oil. Neutrogena. Triple action. Heading clay mask. Some others i don’t even remember.
1446 2018-08-12 20:07:58 Aha oil dey your head
1447 2018-08-12 20:07:51 The recipe for egg mayonnaise is nuts. Take some eggs and blend with oil until you have a thick emulsion that neither looks nor tastes like an egg. Then mash some egg into it. It is a culinary metaphor for recursion.
1448 2018-08-12 20:07:46 Same old arsenal? Might be since the oil money flooded to pl 
1449 2018-08-12 20:07:05 Only that used domestically within Scotland plus the extraction tax paid by the oil companies.
1450 2018-08-12 20:07:01 Oh fer crissake. Don’t act surprised that he’s nothing but a partisan hack and  manipulative actor — selling snake oil like all fake evangelical phonies. He’s of the same mold as Falwell, Graham, Hatch, Sessions, Huckabee. Carnival barkers taking $ to sell Democracy. Deplorable.

They are letting him in!
1453 2018-08-12 20:06:51 Yes, the key as I researched, is fossil fuels. However, I’ve noticed that China isn’t playing Trump/Putin ball. Hence tariffs punishments. They’re = future. NK has oil <3 China has other realignment chart. China no intention being #2,3...
1454 2018-08-12 20:06:48 Then that’s 1 thing we can agree on.. now convince your prince to sell his interest in Albert wheat

1465 2018-08-12 20:05:09 I texted my mom & told her I was probably gonna come to her house tomorrow morning to shower bc I think we officially ran out of oil & mom says “oh ok.” Thanks for the empathy mom, I appreciate it

1492 2018-08-12 20:02:40 There is at least 20% less oil in a barrel of crude from Alberta because the rest of it is a dilution materials, which have to be removed before can be processed hence the lower price.
1493 2018-08-12 20:02:14 Been there done that. The shampoos aren't great. You need a really good comb and oil. Or hire a knit-picker...

1515 2018-08-12 19:59:32 Koepka leaking oil and opening the door and Tiger is too. Can’t find a fairway or green. Ugh.
1516 2018-08-12 19:59:08 Have you tried cannabis oil by the way? And go vegan etc.
1517 2018-08-12 19:59:06 Some say the Gulf of Mexico oil spill was caused by him urinating.
1518 2018-08-12 19:59:03 America needs Saudi oil so will remain quiet. Just like it remained quiet with the Saudis babyish response to Canada.
1519 2018-08-12 19:59:02 Hope heat helped. Eat rice chick sea stuff with too much oil. Might in to bristol unoppow despite weather. Need a change
1520 2018-08-12 19:59:00 うーん、起きた
1521 2018-08-12 19:58:56 I'm just coconut oil spreading and rose water spraying my way through life.
1522 2018-08-12 19:58:55 Oh look....Snake Oil Salesmen are apparently making a comeback! 
You guys are having the most detrimental effect on fake religion to date. Your hypocrisy is so nauseating and obvious. And your false piety is pitifully pathetic.
1523 2018-08-12 19:58:52 so can the oil field give me my dad back now..
1524 2018-08-12 19:58:36 Again, invest some proceeds from the oil advances in the Law Enforcement Agencies which Granger lock off in the BOG. Computerized and link the departments via computer database. Install cameras along highways and roadways on lamp posts. Computerized police cars.
1525 2018-08-12 19:58:31 Barry will tell you he did flaxseed oil

1527 2018-08-12 19:58:23 Venezuela still has lots of oil. Why don’t we get it from Venezuela instead of Saudi Arabia?
1528 2018-08-12 19:58:06 But Gonsalves ji, why are you presuming India is dumb? Why do you think US lifted Sanctions on certain high tech recently despite India impoeting oil from Iran? What implications does this have with China? Think.
1529 2018-08-12 19:58:06 And we've got to stop buying their oil.  Plenty of other source countries available
1530 2018-08-12 19:57:58 @elonmusk  what’s the thought behind selling shares to Saudi , a country that depends on selling oil? Aren’t you worried that they will destroy Tesla?
1531 2018-08-12 19:57:55 Oh and I use an oil free moisturizer from Mario Bedescu with SPF 15 and Biore sunscreen SPF 50
1532 2018-08-12 19:57:48 you can use most edible oils in cooking,for example lime in a cake mix as a natural flavouring etc,not that scary really,but i like to infuse them into coconut oil at low temps to keep the health benifits as fresh as poss without degrading the oils
1533 2018-08-12 19:57:26 Amazing footage !!  To be honest, I just watched a Youtube on perf guns to make sure I understand and the process is fascinating. Looking forward to the results.

1535 2018-08-12 19:57:22 Better yet, if the oil corps offer you $$, donate it to group working on renewable energy or environmental protection & vote how you would have voted anyway. That would be more convincing than pretending that refusing corp $$ somehow proves you can't be bought.
1536 2018-08-12 19:57:19 Take Cod Liver Oil soft gels daily
1537 2018-08-12 19:57:04 Too easy. 
1538 2018-08-12 19:57:01 an interesting oil heater Jay. Reminded me of paraffin types from many yrs ago, but they were a bit dodgy and, i think, no longer in use
1539 2018-08-12 19:57:00 Hopefully, some of those who will have lost their jobs in the oil industry due to improved technology and tightening corporate budgets will be able to find a place in those sectors.
1540 2018-08-12 19:56:53 They told me to use coconut oil to try to revive it
1541 2018-08-12 19:56:50 Biotin worked but gave me cystic acne. I now use collagen peptides and add to my morning shake. That and almond oil every night before bedtime.

1543 2018-08-12 19:56:32 We saw finals @ Lucas Oil. Congratulations Santa Clara Vanguard!!
1544 2018-08-12 19:56:24 The last time the rand was this weak (Nov '17), oil cost ±$65/barrel. The time before that (Nov '16), oil was ±$45. Today oil is $73. This is going to hurt.
1545 2018-08-12 19:56:20 Oh no not more oil how will we cope 
1546 2018-08-12 19:56:10 Peel and dice the potatoes into 2cm cubes. Parboil them and allow them to cool. Toss in vegetable oil and bake at 200c for 20-30 minutes.

1548 2018-08-12 19:55:53 He did his best on healthcare. Normalized Cuba relations, expanded our national parks an unprecedented amount, pardoned thousands of nonviolent drug offenders, appointed 2 very liberal Supreme Court judges, ban oil drilling in large parts of the arctic and Atlantic, I could go on
1549 2018-08-12 19:55:52 two words : moroccan oil .
1550 2018-08-12 19:55:51 I understand.  But if you comb through warmed oil or mayonnaise, leave it for about a 1/2 hour and then shampoo thoroughly, enough should penetrate into the fibre to make the hair lay flat. If that fails, I would then suggest a clothes conditioner like Downy or dryer sheets.

1553 2018-08-12 19:54:51 bellissimo Mr. President. Watch out for the olive oil on the rumpus room couch, stains like a sonofabitch.
1554 2018-08-12 19:54:40 Facts  I think ima go a shade lighter when I get it. We’ll see though. They said it’s good to have an oil type primer too because it gets kinda dry quick. hopefully it works out
1555 2018-08-12 19:54:40 I want to become an essential oil expert so passionate & in love with oils
1556 2018-08-12 19:54:38 Don't think there's any thc in cbd oil
1557 2018-08-12 19:54:25 One argument is against GOP taking the oil momey but notice the DNC wasn't down before 
1558 2018-08-12 19:54:24 Why not? Unless you are estatic with your preconceived notions of oil tankers? How ironic that you trust science of global climate change(I do too) but you absolutely deny engineering technology in preventing leaks or spills.
1559 2018-08-12 19:54:20 Got: Obama NOT an expert at anything. Everything so eloquently from his mouth is just another lie of the snake oil salesman.

Very interesting though in a South African speech 2 weeks ago he introduced himself as the 1st US president born in Kenya.

God Bless America & the Trumps
1560 2018-08-12 19:53:56 Finally got some CBD oil. Let’s see!
1561 2018-08-12 19:53:53 Skunk oil is effective lubricant for your sidearm.  It also keeps the defenders away
1562 2018-08-12 19:53:42 To preserve olive oil with its healthy contents, store it in dark colored bottles away from light &amp; heat.
1563 2018-08-12 19:53:30 I am no troll. The substance of your tweet was wrong. It’s simple math: the ruble tracks pretty closely to the price of oil. In Q4 ‘14, the price of oil fell dramatically. Russia has many problems, but it doesn’t allow you to conflate different issues.
1564 2018-08-12 19:53:21 Miss u so much Artoo, looking forward for your flying stunts and oil burning troopers on IX 
1565 2018-08-12 19:53:20 Maybe give it a good soaking of orange oil before taking a sander to it? I find that works well to clean & revive it & prevents the sander taking off too much due to the dry flakiness of weathered wood.
1566 2018-08-12 19:53:18 extremely simple. cook some veg in the pan in oil,  scrambled up eggs and milk poured over, solidify a bit on the stove then oven to finish. any veg in it really, i put squash blossoms and the tomato on top then melted horseradish cheddar over at the end

1568 2018-08-12 19:53:09 The DNC abandoned their policy to cut oil money after two months; between those months the DNC trailed behind GOP by 8 million.
1569 2018-08-12 19:52:38 I did one round of microneedling (Vampire Facial), then used the olehenrikson oil control face wash, toner and moisturizer morning and night! Also have been using a pumpkin enzyme scrub 2-3 times a week and drinking lots of water! 
1570 2018-08-12 19:52:28 Im appreciating my ass in a chair and beer in my hand 
1571 2018-08-12 19:52:12 @RepRyanZinke how much money did you get from big oil and coal ? do they own you ? my friends tell me your an evil bastard who only cares about himself  your a coward thats why trump picked you his puppet what a twit
1572 2018-08-12 19:52:11 Note to self - never mention nits to a child with ASD before bed, as this will trigger a full on meltdown. Also be sure of headlice facts as said child will ask all sorts. Also find evidence that lavender oil deters them - as he will want proof in the morning
1573 2018-08-12 19:52:06 Bristol Rovers lost to Oil Caants? What is this i hear?!

1578 2018-08-12 19:51:39 Trump doubled tariffs because of a base the US is building on the Syrian border (oil) that Turkey strongly opposes, not because of the pastor like trump tells you.

1581 2018-08-12 19:50:14  uwu am just heckin hiring mercenaries to establish oil outposts in Africa
1582 2018-08-12 19:50:05 Pro brand is Moroccan Oil, Drugstore would be Not Your Mother’s Clean Freak. I can get you the Moroccan Oil cheap though 
1583 2018-08-12 19:50:00 Oh, and my Australian Shepard got into the wax. It didn't burn her, but a section of her fur is a mess. 

My fiancee is out getting some baby oil and Goo Gone.
1584 2018-08-12 19:49:58 Bersihin cleansing oil nya harus bersih nder, aku malah kenyel sih
1585 2018-08-12 19:49:57 Brought my car to the shop bc it’s leaking coolant somehow somewhere and the guy behind the counter has the NERVE to tell me they’ve mentioned changing the radiator hoses a few times during my oil change visits. My dude, I wasn’t paying attention then!!!!!!!!!!!
1586 2018-08-12 19:49:52 As long as our gov. continues to support 100 yr tech made by the oil countries ICE will never go away. I think testa needs to lower the $ now that they are 200k company. The incentive was made to offset cost for consumer. By time u get to 200k cost should have dropped but didn't
1587 2018-08-12 19:49:49 We are leaking oil
1588 2018-08-12 19:49:48 maybe try drying them out by applying toothpaste or tee tree oil? and cold cucumbers for the redness
1589 2018-08-12 19:49:43 Do you have any literature about the legitimacy of “water soluble” CBD? I keep seeing brands promoting its benefits standard CBD oil but i can’t seem to find any studies on it. Is “water soluble” just a marketing scam?
1590 2018-08-12 19:49:39 You should be ashamed to tweet this to the public. The oil comes from SS and SE and they have only one representative. SW has two and the rest are from the North. The is bad and not in the spirit of fairness and justice, which has been the problem of this @MBuhari government.
1591 2018-08-12 19:49:30 Many a cooking error today: oil from chopping chilies under left thumbnail, proportions disaster on Thai green curry, then mismeaured the fluid in a chicken dish. Thank heavens savory recipes are forgiving.

1594 2018-08-12 19:49:16 The only reason mine survive is the awesomeness that they are when paired with mozzarella, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and basil.

1601 2018-08-12 19:48:06 Oh, it's real enough. Do you not go shopping? Of course you have to strip out normal variables affecting prices, like extreme weather or oil price fluctuations. It's even more marked in things like building materials, a very large proportion of which are imported.
1602 2018-08-12 19:48:05 How’s that new fracking and oil production going??  @SecretaryZinke
1603 2018-08-12 19:48:02 Getting some car therapy in today, working on pony, brakes, rotors, struts, oil, transmission the whole kit and caboodle!  Looks like she’ll need some tires, cooler weather and some TLC to make 200k! Happy Sunday!
1604 2018-08-12 19:48:01 The refinery in Gander is not the option , it's the Irving oil refinery,  and if you give the Irving's the choice, they would rather just keep refining the same stuff. This isn't a complicated concept. But for people who are into windmills and solar panels, you know about change

1609 2018-08-12 19:47:31 Changing your own oil, vs. taking it to a shop is 100% much more fulfilling. Shops cut a lot of corners...they don't always re-attach all of your splash-guard screws...they over-torque and cross-thread your oil pan bolt. You avoid all that by DIY.
1610 2018-08-12 19:47:27 Oil movement will be squelched
1611 2018-08-12 19:47:24 Environmentalists protest and shut down our oil while saying nothing of dictator oil, which also has no enviro standards.

1613 2018-08-12 19:47:20 Probably it’s oil
1614 2018-08-12 19:46:42 Your hair& body smelly oil is so nice  I suspect it will only last me a week as I'm spraying in on everything! @Rituals
1615 2018-08-12 19:46:38 Drill baby drill!  Louisiana’s oil industry yanked during Obama’s
1616 2018-08-12 19:46:26 True, it has no major oil reserves.
1617 2018-08-12 19:46:07 Tasted amazing! Everything from the garden except the bread and olive oil
1618 2018-08-12 19:46:06 Calling people on their BS is a required negative.  But then again, those who bought snake oil from @realDonaldTrump don’t want to admit they have been duped.

1620 2018-08-12 19:45:54 Il be using bio oil on that scar I think lol try n get rid of it  aww I really hope you find a decent doctor or physio to help you properly that’s awful that they didn’t help properly either time!
1621 2018-08-12 19:45:54 Harley fell on their socket wrench!  Think what will happen to the Harley engine oil industry, 2 quarts in the engine one leaks on the ground.  They'll go broke! That plus the oil dry folks!
1622 2018-08-12 19:45:53 By contrast, Over seas, oil is owned by dictators.  They become fabulously wealthy while their people suffer and starve.  
Go into mosques and you will find jade toilets but no public education.

1632 2018-08-12 19:44:19 Have you forgotten that GEj commissioned onitsha seaport, Orient petroleum and name Anambra State as oil producing State. He also started 2nd Niger bridge and paid %of money. He also stated onitsha -Enugu express way. Tell me the infrastructure @MBuhari started.
1633 2018-08-12 19:44:09 Not sure if duality or oil slickin lol
1634 2018-08-12 19:44:05 This thought is perfect. Now hold it in your mind while you consider the rest of the story. 
Oil in the west has been the single greatest source of wealth to elevate the middle class from no education to phds. The average person can become fabulously wealthy on pur resources.
1635 2018-08-12 19:43:53 Very disappointed that @Petco sells tea tree oil products for dogs and cats, including toothpaste. Tea tree oil is a known neurotoxin to these animals, even in a diluted form, specifically when ingested. I wish #petco cared more about pet safety than catering to #hipster #trends

1638 2018-08-12 19:43:17 Yeah there are so many options that you really gotta try a few before you know what works the best for you. Have you tried CBD oil? I haven’t decided if it works for me yet hahah

1642 2018-08-12 19:42:45 I understand that regional cities always get ignored but vzla’s 2nd largest city, Maracaibo, & center of oil production hasn’t had power in almost 3 days. It’s sweltering there. Think Houston. Caracas got wire stories from a 3 hr blackout. Think it’s time for a Maracaibo story
1643 2018-08-12 19:42:42 But not banned, unless CAN tries to start importing again, then the US will make that stop as well as with Iranian oil
1644 2018-08-12 19:42:27 I need to read more about Jagmeet. The last thing I read was he said we should get oil from other countries. I don't know which countries he was talking about. @ylc_jlc @CJPMYC @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party #sundayscrum

1652 2018-08-12 19:40:46 I get the 2nd two, but not quite the oil dependence thing! ?
Marijuana Oil?
1653 2018-08-12 19:40:25 But that was just after YOU trained, paid and supported the attack of 9/11. And unfortunately Canada is not a superpower. So go back to your hole in the sand and suck oil.

1655 2018-08-12 19:40:09 Better off with Jimmy.
He would have solved the Palestinian conflict.
Jimmy would have balanced the budget instead of putting us on the path to debt.
We wouldn't have been dependent on foreign oil.
1656 2018-08-12 19:40:09 Of course! I had a post about this on Style It but I didn't bring it over to Rascal Honey, sadly. 

My nails peel really badly and Jin Soon has lectured me in her loving way about cuticle oil. I try, but.... I'm not the greatest at using it either.

1659 2018-08-12 19:39:40 What spices are you using? On my grill chicken I like crushed pepper, some garlic, a little lime juice, oregano, sprinkled as I turn the chicken , little olive oil, EXTRA VIRGIN

1663 2018-08-12 19:39:15 Try a mayonnaise or olive oil conditioner!
1664 2018-08-12 19:39:08 Cooking oil wouldn’t be idesl, since it’s solid at room temperature it would interfere with the grains absorbing moisture while they soak, plus loss of browning and that toasty brown butter flavor.
1665 2018-08-12 19:39:05 The oil industry runs the oil industry. That was my original point, Garry.

1667 2018-08-12 19:38:35 You have to heat the oven to 500 with the cast iron in it. Then take out the cast iron & put it on the highest FLAME you have - Salt, Pepper, Garlic Salt & Olive Oil - 30 seconds each side. Then back into the oven -  1:20 on each side - Rare and good! Not grilled, but its good.
1668 2018-08-12 19:38:25 I hate crying because I did a whole face care routine and now I’ve wiped out all the good the lotion and tea tree oil did
1669 2018-08-12 19:38:22 I want panels but I also want Cdns in control of Cdn energy and not import it from oppressive sources. We all want to reduce dependence on oil but that wont happen quickly. Until real practical alternatives are found (& they will be) we have to to use oil as wisely as possible.
1670 2018-08-12 19:38:18 I use straight up coconut oil and it’s the only thing that’s ever fully removed it. Literally nothing else works.
1671 2018-08-12 19:38:15 Me toooo. It’s amazing what it can do. I switched from nug to oil and it’s by far the best choice I’ve made. It’s a cleaner high and my mouth doesn’t get as dry honestly.
1672 2018-08-12 19:38:01 Thats not olive oil in your food sir, its hydrolic fluid but just as good

1675 2018-08-12 19:37:27 Health tip: deep fry with olive oil. It’s good for your heart #fakeAdvice #listenToThisAndDie
1676 2018-08-12 19:37:16 Yep and it’s thicker than regular castor oil so it works as a good sealant for moisture. Also stimulates hair growth they say, so lots of ppl use it for their edges.
1677 2018-08-12 19:37:13 Lately I've been using Johnson's no tears baby original shampoo and a little coconut oil left on them, it prevents fleas, it smells great, I'll be sticking to this combination, I get a fresh batch of organic coconut oil handmade by a Japanese girl nearby
1678 2018-08-12 19:37:12 Denying that you're a leftist, telling the Alberta  Cons how to run the oil industry ? Now that's funny. We have a pipeline almost completely in place, the Irving's are already rail hauling western  oil to their refinery, where do you think that Lac Megantic oil train came from?
1679 2018-08-12 19:37:10 Damn. I love you covered in oil too

1683 2018-08-12 19:36:38 Ummm can you explain one thing just one president Trump has given to Russia that makes him a traitor???? I mean sanctions and blasting Germany for being used by Russia for oil does not seem to be good “puppet” like behavior. Stop spewing silly talking points.
1684 2018-08-12 19:36:34 Once you’ve let it harden on the skin, you can dab it with some oil and that can help it “peel” or slide off.
Acetone will help break it down too but I don’t really recommend soaking your skin on it  I hope you get it off soon and feel better! That really sucks

1687 2018-08-12 19:36:15 Thank god we don't actually need oil just a more open mind towards our modern technology
1688 2018-08-12 19:36:12 It's def cooled and glances at oil tank 
1689 2018-08-12 19:36:04 This is the beginning of my weekend, since I work graveyard shift Wednesday to Sunday. I'm trying to catch up on sleep and do some oil paintings with my brand new oil paints and linseed oil
1690 2018-08-12 19:36:04 Kicked out a creep when he looked me up and down asking if I gave massages with the oil we sell :-)
1691 2018-08-12 19:35:38 I get in this fight with my brother in law often. Yes, solar/wind can be the future. Long term. Keep developing them. 
But short/mid term we need coal, Nat gas, oil, and ideally nuclear. 
Nuke is safe has no evil CO2 and makes a lot of power.
1692 2018-08-12 19:35:15 Good ol oil
1693 2018-08-12 19:35:15 Ah, ooh I like the idea of a ‘fluctuating’ list dependent on how a SL or character cheeses one off in any given week. Hmm  Hanna = yes, dispensable  (dissed Nee’oil) Burns & Tobee = yes ( both useless). Kate = no, drives me mad, but good irritation value. #thearchers

1696 2018-08-12 19:34:36 Coconut oil. A little messy, but highly recommended.

1700 2018-08-12 19:33:12 I would be thinking about h. pylori !    For short term help, tea tree essential oil, or young living's purification can really help, but can cause discomfort when first applying
1701 2018-08-12 19:33:09 For how long have you been painting with oil?

1710 2018-08-12 19:32:17 He designed the borders while Foreign Secretary because he wanted a Muslim-majority country so that they would show preference to British ships en route to the Arabian oil fields.
1711 2018-08-12 19:32:16 Ill remember that. We have a peat/ oil sort of a system combined.

1737 2018-08-12 19:29:17 Ok so from 186k there are 68k missing in the private sector or like the 27% of corporate Calgary sitting empty not to return for oil and gas. At present pricing I think those days are gone shy of another war.
1738 2018-08-12 19:29:15 I suppose the best response would be nothing in this world is free. You can't say the money goes to you and still have a 25% poverty demo. The money can go to certain people. But somebody in an oil rich country is deciding who it benefits.
1739 2018-08-12 19:29:09 Looks like you two should have discussed V05 hot oil.
1740 2018-08-12 19:29:09 No, it was just a name that people in business used. I think it came from that (original?) consortium that wanted to develop the oil sands project but wanted huge Govt dollars/ tax breaks to defer development costs. In the end i think they all pulled out. Started that recession?

1744 2018-08-12 19:28:56 Thanks for the link!

c + L = W

To me c + L are the same thing, there is no reason to distinguish between a machine consuming oil and a human eating food. 

but I agree that it is useful to think of W as some aggregate economic capacity.

In fact:
W=function(Personal Narrative)
1745 2018-08-12 19:28:51 We only give oil ,,,no cash transfer in western union
1746 2018-08-12 19:28:43 Leftist view? You've got to be kidding. I've been telling Alberta's Conservatives that they aren't taking a Conservative view of the oil industry. They seem to think that the government should tell refineries how to operate.
1747 2018-08-12 19:28:28 We backed an overthrow of a democratic elected government in favor of a brutal dictator who was willing to sell oil at a better price. Is it any wonder Iran isn't friends with us?  Should we move on to central America lol.

1753 2018-08-12 19:27:24 At least 500 years of oil left. Asphalt deposit size of Florida in Canda alone which when melted yields oil and tar. Many other sources such as shale. We don't need it. 2040 nearly all cars electric, more efficient and cheap (5 moving parts) and no (rare) breakdowns.

1786 2018-08-12 19:22:49 The glut is still there, Ohio showed a huge volume still in storage. This is about the private sector jobs that ppl like to point to. Oil is coming back but without pipeline we trade at a deficit. With pipeline we make more money but those jobs are still redundant.

1796 2018-08-12 19:21:37 The quality of life they poor people have is heartbreaking, USA and UK stand by and watch. If they discovered oil in the west bank, America would be right in to to deliver freedom.

Talk about snake oil.

1798 2018-08-12 19:21:35 Don't take my word for it, it's a famous quote. I'm not sure that there's anywhere that the government runs every aspect of any business, but there are many countries that have nationalized oil industries for instance. To what degree those businesses are allowed independence, idk
1799 2018-08-12 19:21:26 It’s to look something.  Without floating oil sponge booms it won’t be effective.
1800 2018-08-12 19:21:25 Olive oil I fucking hate you mf 
1801 2018-08-12 19:21:19 Sure and it wasn’t just oil.
Losing country of origin will irrevocably damage UK companies, less jobs, less tax, food prices will go up, less money for public services,  nhs etc 
There’s no good reason to commit economic suicide. 
The only true choice is EEA or cancel Brexit
1802 2018-08-12 19:21:10 Equally who cares about Saudi Arabia as well they should suffer isolation from other countries as well. We and others should move away from oil then they would have their wealth
1803 2018-08-12 19:21:09 Uh!!! Wishing it was my job to rub coconut oil all over them every single day until i die!
1804 2018-08-12 19:20:51 I'ts a great product for sure.. My Shea facial cream is now enjoying the benefits of lime essential oil. Miracle. Already on to my coconut and frankincence toothpaste. Just waitng for a food grade oil. Natures health and beauty benefits.
1805 2018-08-12 19:20:34 Technically, they’re not wrong.
1806 2018-08-12 19:20:22 I was cooking some nuggets then that mutherfucking oil pop into my face mmm... OUCH!
1807 2018-08-12 19:20:15 use oil and shampoos for dry hair
1808 2018-08-12 19:20:06 OBAMA and TRUMP plus America could have stopped it but guess what,Saudi is showing them money and Oil
1809 2018-08-12 19:19:54 Ok thanks.

1811 2018-08-12 19:19:29 Oh for sure. I haven't discovered what triggers my flare ups yet. But stress is definitely the biggest factor I've figured so far. My CBD oil has been awesome at keeping the inflammation down as well.
1812 2018-08-12 19:19:07 But the oil?
1813 2018-08-12 19:19:06 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
1814 2018-08-12 19:19:02 We don't want your dirty, undiversified oil 'wealth'. 

We want to protect the irreplaceable health of our coastal waters, wildlife, & people.
1815 2018-08-12 19:18:44 Oil pens are truly a blessing
1816 2018-08-12 19:18:36 “Work on your weaknesses until the become your strengths.”
Big picture, I don’t agree w that anymore.  Example:  I’m not very mechanical, at all really.  I can’t change my own oil or brakes.  Doesn’t mean I’m going to dedicate time to learning how to rebuild a transmission
1817 2018-08-12 19:18:31 Nne leba shimane water and Oil. 
1818 2018-08-12 19:18:30 Love Banana Boat. I wish they had a body wash. We did baby oil and Iodine back in the late 70’s early 80’s. Until we got our pool me and my sisters would lay on our roof High AF
1819 2018-08-12 19:18:22 Get some lavender oil and put it under your nose! I also drink herbal teas that help. Walmart has them in the tea section, just look at which ones are for anxiety!
1820 2018-08-12 19:18:22 Realy unbeatable and unbelievable technology. Any ways which gas is emitted from these dirty water is a matter of research for scientists now after 2019. With this we don't need to pay our oil bills. Will patent many of this Naalis before the Ambani, Adani take it in their charge
1821 2018-08-12 19:18:14 Don’t lie to me that was baby oil! Wha- 
1822 2018-08-12 19:18:08 Lol I need address
1823 2018-08-12 19:18:07 This is not true. You should research a company called White Line Pvt Ltd in Laamu. You'd find the oil bowsers of the company in front of a house of particular significant person (read adhurey). So yes Fenaka-STO has various middlemen in between
1824 2018-08-12 19:18:07 How bout treatin yersel te some heating oil?! 
1825 2018-08-12 19:17:59 White is hands down, my favourite colour, when I'm doing Oil, or Acrylic paintings; saving lives(painting mistakes)!
1826 2018-08-12 19:17:58 Were these farms checked for minerals and oil first? Geologists were sniffing around in KwazuluNatal about 4 years ago?
1827 2018-08-12 19:17:15 I'm glad you understand dear,Allah yayi jagora
1828 2018-08-12 19:17:13 I want to make an order, let me try it. Do you have coconut oil too?
1829 2018-08-12 19:16:55 harry Pelosi caused the recession by driving up oil prices

0bama turned recession to global depression w/failed policies like cash for clunkerclintons 

TARP was Bush's idea, and so were the tax cuts hussein made permanent
1830 2018-08-12 19:16:54 The problem with dumping Saudi Arabia as an ally (for the US) is that another rival power (Russia, China etc ) will jump in quickly to fill in that vacuum and take advantage of the resources (oil) that the Saudi's have to offer.
1831 2018-08-12 19:16:52 yes, linked to 5 states we getting less and less, you giving our wealth oil resources away, shame on you use less lot you boiling every Iranian's blood,

1833 2018-08-12 19:16:14 Yea man, I mean I don't think every Nissan ends up having issues but it's something to note. Every automaker has its own unique issues (Toyota eats a lot of oil)
1834 2018-08-12 19:15:58 I help as much as i can too, i'm a lady and might not be capable of doing what you as a man did. I know i can be in their shoes so i'm not shaming them... "whoever shames one will not die untill he experiences the same thing"

1836 2018-08-12 19:15:26 Gotta put some oil in my car wen I get off 
1837 2018-08-12 19:15:22 Love to get under my car, change the oil, rotate the tires and do a thorough rust check before telling the person waiting for my spot that I'm not leaving until the good Lord calls me home (usually around 6PM most nights).
1838 2018-08-12 19:15:06 Dear Rishi, if you see mulgikars screen shot it shows that 29000 cr was saved in LPG subsidy till FY 17.
@BharatVarma3 has correctly pointed out that CAG itself has shown that 22,000 crore is due to falling oil prices and not Aadhaar.
1839 2018-08-12 19:15:00 Thank you to all Americans, I want to wish Jewish families many blessings in the 2016 Election - and why not, I want strong military & low oil price...
1840 2018-08-12 19:14:54 In a normal sauté pan?? Should I use walnut oil or usual rapeseed oil?
1841 2018-08-12 19:14:45 Forever wishing the car would change its own oil.
1842 2018-08-12 19:14:05 And on the way to building Occidental chemical & oil company,  Armand Hammer made some very powerful friends including making sure he donated money to Nixon's CREEP through Nixon bff mobster Bebe Rebozo.
1843 2018-08-12 19:13:59 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
1844 2018-08-12 19:13:55 So if Trudeau can unilaterally force an oil pipeline through BC whether or not Horgan wants it, surely he can reinstitute the Universal Basic Income whether or not Ford wants it.
1845 2018-08-12 19:13:43 Hot cooking take of the day: don't cook with extra virgin olive oil! Its a scam! Use the cheap stuff and add the good stuff at the end for a finishing touch!

This has been EJTs cooking corner bringing you flavor on a budget since 2018™

1847 2018-08-12 19:13:35 But solar panels and wind turbines aren’t a viable solution?  That technology already exist, why not push those so our oil and natural gas become a luxury we aren’t dependent on?
1848 2018-08-12 19:13:35 I guess you can say these left media outlets  who helped out the CIA & an oil company were being very patriotic using their infiltrators, mercenaries and agent provoceteurs. Pretty shocking stuff. I guess there's not many  pure media outlets to work for.
1849 2018-08-12 19:13:24 Y’cant bate the sweet scent of two-stroke oil being burned in an engine at speed!
1850 2018-08-12 19:13:24 there's alot of those small road humps in my areas, plays havoc. but I do check the oil/water regular.......I'm not a car person

1853 2018-08-12 19:13:08 The Saudis make trillions selling oil. $2B is nothing to them. They would benefit if Tesla goes out of business. As shareholders with voting rights, they might be able to make them go out of business faster. That's how other billionaire scumbags like George Soros invest too.
1854 2018-08-12 19:12:44 If you have a strong message, a whisper will be heard around the world. If you don't, you can't pay enough to make people care. That's why @Ocasio2018 is on the rise, and why the Democratic party, with its renewed commitment to oil money, is desperately flailing.

1861 2018-08-12 19:10:47 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1862 2018-08-12 19:10:34 "slick a can of oil"... Now THAT is a phrase and a half.
1863 2018-08-12 19:10:11 Yemen's offshore oil reserves.  Follow the oil.
1864 2018-08-12 19:10:07 I put olive oil in everything. It’s not a problem that those are all fat calories?

1867 2018-08-12 19:09:43 Las inversiones en Ancap, están. y usted mismo las puede ver si va a la Teja. Se realizó una inversión para mejorar el gas oil, quitar el plomo a las naftas, utilizar agua dulce para intercambiadores y no salada. Mejoras en los efluentes.....
1868 2018-08-12 19:09:43 Exfoliation, cold water, moisturizing with olive oil
1869 2018-08-12 19:09:32 Lol right!!  Well if your handle is your birth year, we're only 10 years off, so still in the same age bracket! I'm at the point where I worry about fine lines and sagging plus still acne and excess oil lol. It's hell!
1870 2018-08-12 19:09:31 No shame losing to those oil caants
1871 2018-08-12 19:09:22 I for one am boycotting all Irving products until they stop buying Saudi Oil
1872 2018-08-12 19:09:12 So I did an oil treatment on my hair yesterday like some kind of ethnic, but you guys. My hair is softer than a baby's bhole.
1873 2018-08-12 19:09:02 my goal is not to put oil on the fire. Remember that we will be celebrating Michael's 60th birthday this month and just for that, you should all stop criticizing each other.
1874 2018-08-12 19:08:55 Why recession happened in 2016, there's shortfall in oil revenue. The govt then tried to sincerely diversify the economy. Sectors like Agricultural and Manufacturing sustained the economy during that period until Nigeria exited recession. Capital flight also caused the recession.
1875 2018-08-12 19:08:45 hook me up with that vegetable oil
1876 2018-08-12 19:08:43 Boiling oil
1877 2018-08-12 19:08:42 my dudes im so happy too I've been using castor oil an takin me vitamins and drinking water and my hairs been starting to grow more, i wanna get it down to my waist possibly by the time I'm heading back to school

1880 2018-08-12 19:08:33 My dad thinks he’s too soft, ole coconut oil ass
1881 2018-08-12 19:08:30 1970年代に、中東からの石油の供給が中断した。
In the 1970s, oil supplies from the Middle East were disrupted.
1882 2018-08-12 19:08:28 It's great to see how this board looks like. I'm sure well-meaning citizens will remember that NNPC's business is oil, and that that oil comes from a certain region, who under this govt obviously do not merit substantial rep on the board of NNPC.
1883 2018-08-12 19:08:24 NOTHING!!! Just cooked potato and onion very slowly first until soft and fry n v hot oil later.(tried hummus , chickpea water)
1884 2018-08-12 19:08:18 Rewatched DAYBREAKERS after 10 years and it’s still a very interesting setup and idea that sort of buckles under its own weight but has some cool themes about classism, health care, and oil even if some plot developments are sorta silly. Solid B movie in grade and style
1885 2018-08-12 19:08:18 Well,  eventually Alberta producers will be able to ship oil to Eastern Canada by super tanker from Burnaby. If must be just the pipelines easterners don’t want....
1886 2018-08-12 19:08:14 Lol why?
To support a snake oil president that's brought zero of his products back to the states to be produced?
1887 2018-08-12 19:08:01 Well yes in Scotland case Alex salmond argument was that the oil price was not going to drop and as we know it crashed a year or so later and is half the price it was even now, he and economics don't mix he would have bankrupted Scotland to get freedom from the union
1888 2018-08-12 19:07:49 I read one time that someone said cooking coconut oil
1889 2018-08-12 19:07:47 "Obasanjo awarded oil blocks for sex, says." 
- Wole Soyinka

Let me just faint.
1890 2018-08-12 19:07:20 Two snake oil salesmen. An embarrassment to true Christianity.
1891 2018-08-12 19:07:17 We want price oil to go up, but in back end taxes to finance greener options & continue to subsidize EVs. & reduce oil exploration investment & redirect to alternatives. We have too many eggs now in 1 basket.
1892 2018-08-12 19:06:54 Republicans: Lose to Obama and embrace the tea party movement gaining 1000 seats
Democrats: Lose to Trump and decide to become diet republicans by accepting money from oil companies again. Embrace progressives and gain your seats back dipshits
1893 2018-08-12 19:06:53 Sounds like the FIPK stuff we used at Nissan. You could literally just place an oil pan and not put any bolts in it and it would hold lol
1894 2018-08-12 19:06:43 I used to have a hybrid.
Straight bars, 3x6, arse up position, etc.
I sat in the pub with @darlocyclesick describing what I hated about it
Chain oil, popping lights on/off, weather effected brakes, rucksacks and riding position.
He said two words… #GoDutch
1895 2018-08-12 19:06:19 So I have problem with people getting so excited about the employment numbers. My problem is they so temporary. These oil field jobs, are temporary and they are destroying our world. Create jobs in the renewable.... wind, solar, medical, legal
1896 2018-08-12 19:06:19 awww... just keep showing her love... she’ll get better... also try lavender oil on a bandana... tie it on her... its naturally relaxing & may help calm her
1897 2018-08-12 19:05:58 Somebody wanna be a blessing nd cash app $60 for my oil change cuz ion feeling paying for it
1898 2018-08-12 19:05:54 On two separate occasions,  I’ve dropped/broken two full bottles of olive oil in the past 24 hours. 
How’s your day going?
1899 2018-08-12 19:05:52 Well, most of the decline in Nixon’s JA happened before the oil embargo.
1900 2018-08-12 19:05:44 El ejedrez de Chevorn, es un tablero mas importante. Nos entretienen, mientras tanto con la farándula de la tv mayamera y los calzones de requesén. @LaHojillaenTV
1901 2018-08-12 19:05:31 I gotcha. (I.e. I'm not bitter...) Oh! Go visit a shelter for cuddles! Or I can send you Cooper, but I suggest the former because he's pre-bath and a stinky oil slick.
1902 2018-08-12 19:05:30 Dry skin is really just your skin producing to much oil. Just use some rubbing alcohol or either witch hazel and wash it with worm water and then use coconut oil or Shea butter to hydrate it. I have the same problems and that what I do.
1903 2018-08-12 19:05:20 Well the DNC on Friday overturned lobbying rules concerning donations from Oil companies, so that's a pretty good chunk of it there, but for HRC, she had to use money laundering through state parties to keep her campaign afloat  and did it in part with money
1904 2018-08-12 19:04:56 Part of the reasoning for that is conservative history if selling off Alberta oil for pennies to foreign interests for next to nothing though. Now they essentially want liberals to swoop in and nationalize things to fix their mistake.
1905 2018-08-12 19:04:54 Beard oil. Crikey!
1906 2018-08-12 19:04:31 In 2014, a Barrel of Crude was $98.89. 2015, it dropped to 52.32. In 2016, it slipped to 43.74. 2017, @ 54.15 and in 2018, it's at 71.06. Illiterates like you doesn't understand that Nigeria is an Oil Economy & that shortfall in global oil price affects oil dependent countries.
1907 2018-08-12 19:04:15 i dont understand cbd oil dosage o well
1908 2018-08-12 19:04:13 So ... Turns out when searching for gun cleaning supplies on Amazon, Gun Oil is lubricant but not the kind you use on metal.
1909 2018-08-12 19:04:05 My brother had success with "Rick Simpson oil" and "the Budwig Diet".
1910 2018-08-12 19:04:05 Obamma has done more than any other President before him. Some of his impressive accomplishments: 5. First President to violate the War Powers Act. 6. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. 2BCont
1911 2018-08-12 19:04:00 I hv helped and motivated a lot of people like that,sometimes the just need a push,try help them,its gonna b cool later
1912 2018-08-12 19:03:59 Americans love oil more than healthcare.
1913 2018-08-12 19:03:55 Actually this well know to us who studied Soviet Economics in Delhi School. Mis allocating investments was developing story but they were spinning that untold riches would emerge from natural resources. We believed that BS because of Oil crisis
1914 2018-08-12 19:03:44 hemp oil creo que es aceite de cáñamo no de cannabis/marihuana
1915 2018-08-12 19:03:44 No East West Road, lagos Ibadan dual carriage rail hasn't happened. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. Meanwhile price of oil has doubled intl market, has your experience of life doubled too or has the price of food more than double has unemployment? Has debt x4?
1916 2018-08-12 19:03:43 ถ้ามีโอกาสครั้งหน้าแนะนำว่าเลือกรอบสุดท้ายหรือใกล้ๆสุดท้ายค่ะ
1917 2018-08-12 19:03:36 Well organised snake oil salesmen are still snake oil salesmen #fbpe
1918 2018-08-12 19:03:25 Is this oil in the north?
1919 2018-08-12 19:03:24 Please push for more mental health research and first and foremost CBD oil approval by FDA as a replacement/ and/or substitute for SSRI SNRI and other anxiolytic drugs. Effexor nearly killed me!
1920 2018-08-12 19:03:11 Hey Richie @RickieFowler nice clean shirt today don’t look like bp oil spill
1921 2018-08-12 19:03:09 Y en el contexto, tambien de una "gira internacional por AL, del SJ Arturo Sosa" con plena cobertura mediática.
1922 2018-08-12 19:03:05 You’ll start to pay attention when we add your 10 stars to our flag. Heard you had oil up there. Prepare to be given freedom.
1923 2018-08-12 19:02:38 Neck Oil
1924 2018-08-12 19:02:32 So you mandate 15000 dollar solar panels and hybrid cars. Outlaw coal and only authorize windmills.  Make power expensive. That will make people conserve. Free market makes breakthroughs. Mandating a change costs huge amounts of money. Add the oil issue.....
1925 2018-08-12 19:02:30 @DiMartinoBooth @dlacalle_IA
In the past 30 years, Mexico has been focusing in increasing its PIB without paying attention to his Current Account Deficit
Year by year, its external debt kept growing, even in those years with high oil prices
1926 2018-08-12 19:02:26 Holy hell that’s beautiful. I thought she put oil or something else clear on her arm oml that’s insanely perfect
1927 2018-08-12 19:02:25 Evening Primrose Oil. 1000mg pills from Trader Joe’s $7.99 (its the cheapest there) It was the only thing that helped my hair stop falling out after my thyroid was removed. Makes your hair thicker and healthier; holds moisture better.
1928 2018-08-12 19:02:24 Some advice from Scotland - don't say a word about Welsh oil.
1929 2018-08-12 19:02:13  Truth! They really do. You can see it in the fake ass press briefings, where crooked eye spins crooked lies. And in the rally's where tangeranus looks so proud to be selling his snake oil.
1930 2018-08-12 19:01:56 If I go give the person what they want for that GT in an hour I hope I’m making the right choice and after I change the oil and transmission fluid that it will be a good car and something I can flip for like a grand or 2 if I pay $400 for it
1931 2018-08-12 19:01:49 @shayne_adkins Hey brother, I've been meaning to call and set up a visit.  I need some new liners, probably an oil change, points and plugs and a wax job on this leg!  Plus I just need a visit!  Miss yall!  Gonna try to remember to call tomorrow!!  
1932 2018-08-12 19:01:48 I'm not shaming anyone. They're not seeking for help, they want us to be friends and then those you associate with will definately have an effect on your performance. I go to school to leaen, not to make friends
1933 2018-08-12 19:01:47 Obama lied and you didn’t say a word. He ruined health care and lied about it and you remained silent. He lied about coal and oil. He lied about his support of Israel. You have been exposed.      No one believes you anymore #FakeNewsMedia #fakenews
1934 2018-08-12 19:01:36 this event is really boring to me i literally spent the entire 2nd island farming oil/cement and still dont have enough to get the stuff from shop

1936 2018-08-12 19:01:31 Cuz he is an evangelist pastor.Evangelists senators make pressure on Trump and also Pence is a so conservetive evangelist.Trump also wnna get evangelist votes.Actually the problem with Turkey is not a pastor issue but Turkey's oil trade with Iran
1937 2018-08-12 19:01:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and you and your family.
1938 2018-08-12 19:01:02 It's their narrow horizon. I mean, what do they know about life? A miniature maybe, but not a large-scale oil painting.
1939 2018-08-12 19:01:02 So my chicken is still alive thankfully, she's pecking at dots of yogurt and i'm dropper feeding her olive oil and acv. She's gonna get a dose of polyvisol and then some scrambled eggs, and hopefully we'll see a difference.

Have you explored CBD Oils to tweak those pain receptors?
(Not marijuana necessarity, nor THC, but the organic hemp oil products.)
1947 2018-08-12 19:00:00 Changed my brake light & checked the oil and water levels in one of my cars by myself today and I feel like a mechanic

1950 2018-08-12 18:59:50 Been voting liberal since 1997. When I voted for this govt I expected a national climate plan that provided incentives for home solar, battery storage and electric vehicles. Instead Trudeau buys an oil pipeline for $12B

1956 2018-08-12 18:58:45 China can effectively bypass Iran sanctions by pricing Iran oil in China's own currency, a move underscored that China has replaced French energy giant Total with an 80.1% stake in the phase 11 of the South Pars (gas field), which has the world’s biggest natural gas reserves
1957 2018-08-12 18:58:38 I bet you like at least one of: sweet condiments like honey or maple syrup; bread condiments like cream cheese or oil/vinegar mixes; complex flavor condiments like chutneys; vegetable spread condiments like guacamole or pesto...
1958 2018-08-12 18:58:36 And it's not even true, you can recycle or repurpose straws, and before they were straws they were oil production byproducts that you have just been toxic waste
1959 2018-08-12 18:58:28 Prayer will cure it with olive oil 
1960 2018-08-12 18:58:16 Coconut oil  I be looking like a copper penny when the sun light hits me 
1961 2018-08-12 18:58:14 Yes, I understand the hypocrisy of fighting against oil production while driving vehicles & heating homes with carbon-based fuels. I chose to work for sustainable resource development & free, prior & informed consent. FNs have a right to make informed decisions for their land.
1962 2018-08-12 18:58:10 So I was driving and my mama reaches over and  randomly puts blessed oil in the middle of my fro... wtf lol I mean thanks but... now I have a greasy spot smack dab in the middle of my shi 
1963 2018-08-12 18:58:02 Hey Phillies have you screwed another player today like you did yesterday with Eflin.  It was a DB move by a DB Klentak and coconut oil
1964 2018-08-12 18:57:42 It was yummy—wish I had some more for this evening. I got the idea from your post of the messy sweet corn you had Janet  Thanks! Sauce is peanut butter, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, cayenne, seasoning & maple syrup 
1965 2018-08-12 18:57:40 When I was 1st picture framing, an asst mgr left a handtruck in the frame shop of the store I worked in. I walked right into it w/ an expensive oil on canvas putting an "L"shaped tear in it.Not only expensive, but belonged to the customer's late Mother. It was anniv of her death.
1966 2018-08-12 18:57:38 If you fought in any war post WWII, you fought for the ability of our corporations to buy and sell to third world countries, mostly oil. Our “freedom” (freedom to be told we must be patriotic, I guess) was never in jeopardy from Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, etc.

Stand for an oil barrel
1967 2018-08-12 18:57:33 Grapeseed Oil>>>>
1968 2018-08-12 18:57:24 everyone hates City cause of all the fraud lifelong City supporters that came around in 2009 when they got the oil money
1969 2018-08-12 18:57:15 This 10-minute oil change shop just recently got under new ownership and changed it's name. Now whenever I drive to the library I get to pass a sign with big blue letters that read, "LUBE-TASTIC"
1970 2018-08-12 18:57:05 Or fear of places like Iraq and other oil rich countries creating an oil embargo for political gain, causing massive economic damage to countries dependent on that oil, like much of Europe. Which they did before. It's hell of a lot more complex than simply blaming an econ system.
1971 2018-08-12 18:56:52 Did China drop tariffs on us oil?
1972 2018-08-12 18:56:40 i woke up to find out reggie changed my oil & oil filter for me before i go to work. thats loveeee.
1973 2018-08-12 18:56:29 Not accurate to say there were not good ppl opposing removing statues. There were good people on both sides outside of Antifa/white supremists. Good ppl can oppose removal for reasons unconnected to supremacy.
1974 2018-08-12 18:56:04 What’s going on w China dropping tariffs on us oil?
1975 2018-08-12 18:56:03 I was laying down with the worst headache of my life sad because I can’t swallow pills so I’ll have to deal with this stupid ass hangover and then I remembered I had cbd oil 
1976 2018-08-12 18:55:58 Agree! Lexus are ace - Audi’s end up burning oil after a few years - unreliable
1977 2018-08-12 18:55:58 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

1983 2018-08-12 18:55:23 What mess did OBJ clean?Military gave birth to corruptions and OBJ who was installed by the Ex General sustained it with massive loots. 16 billion dollars still hanging in balance. Bring him to this issue is like mocking the old man of Ota. Sex for oil rig yet to answer Soyinka
1984 2018-08-12 18:55:23 Still sounds like they were pushed out even by this slanted article. This is my first foray into #ElSegundoTwitter but those scooters connected this disjointed town with its beach. Because we rather have waste water and oil blocking our view. #backtowalking
1985 2018-08-12 18:55:11 You believe Putin? LOL

Trump is drilling oil, and just spent more on defense this year and last than Russia did in the last 10

He got the EU to pony up record cash too

It was 0bama that told Med he'd be more flexible, and then let balaclava'd men seize/annex Crimea w/o a shot
1986 2018-08-12 18:55:07 The msm are like mice in a bowl of oil. Slimy and desperate .
1987 2018-08-12 18:55:07 Oh My! 
My kids used to talk in abstract of a great game they had invented. They called it slippy pigs. The participants were too cover themselves in cooking oil then play tig. Tiny Paddler has simply been recruited on the beta-testing ...

2000 2018-08-12 18:53:24 It has nothing to do with oil, gas and coal and everything to do with the money that the industries spend to keep Republicans in power. Power corrupts and the GOP certainly knows corruption.
2001 2018-08-12 18:53:21 Its one game against a brilliant team bank rolled by an oil rich country, you have to reserve judgement for half a season at least.
2002 2018-08-12 18:53:20 Just had a conversation with someone trying to convince me that there is such thing as “good debt”. We each debated and he told me @DaveRamsey was a “snake oil salesman.

2005 2018-08-12 18:53:12 No. But they really should make every child get prescription strength killer. The OTC stuff doesn't work. I recommend long hair be in a ponytail and I recommend tea tree oil shampoo. The prescription stuff should be free or low cost.
2006 2018-08-12 18:53:10 Oh my god I thought this was clear oil
2007 2018-08-12 18:53:03 You’ve been Americanized cause that shit straight from the kitchen of a yank that cook with too much oil

2010 2018-08-12 18:52:44 I can remember all the warships just lobbing bombs into Baghdad a million dollars a pop too get rid of a president they put in power. The whole oil infrastructure set ablaze and billions too put out the fires and what of the people? Then 9/11

2014 2018-08-12 18:52:28 @walmarthelp Just visited my local Walmart for an oil change 4 hours before closing time and was told they did not have enough help to do my oil change! Is this my problem or yours?
2015 2018-08-12 18:52:26 Last night a man said to me “I love putting oil in my car.”
2016 2018-08-12 18:52:26 Pasta salad. Pasta, chicken, spinach, sundried tomatoes and feta cheese. Extra is oil + tomato puree mixed to keep it from clumping.
2017 2018-08-12 18:52:24 From where you brought those colors like oil colors :-)I know the nature conspires with you to make the perfect view,you are who you are that the Nature loves and in his camera looks so pure.

2019 2018-08-12 18:52:04 NOTHING he says or does will ever be enough. A Benz in every driveway, they would want a Lambo. He could cure 10,000 ills of society and they would focus on the ONE REMAINING PROBLEM.
It's up to leaders on left and their responsibility to stop the insanity
2020 2018-08-12 18:51:58 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2021 2018-08-12 18:51:54 Who OWNS penn oil pipeline? Its complicated right? Lemme guess..Salvation Army? The Lutherans? Red Cross? St Jude children cancer hospitals? Or seedy money freaks who would see you freeze without care? Despicable
2022 2018-08-12 18:51:54 very disappointed that @pfaff staff @festivalofquilt chose to ignore me today when I was trying to buy bobbins, using the machines on her own was obviously more important

2024 2018-08-12 18:51:46 When Sweden criticized Saudi Arabia over human rights  back in 2015, it also cancelled a lucrative arms contract it had in SA.  Sweden was willing to take a financial blow.Trudeau & Freeland just shot off their mouths. They still want their weapons contract and imported oil.

2032 2018-08-12 18:49:39 I will repeat myself again as I’ve said it numerous times, Elon’s goal from the beginning was to help move the world away from Fossil fuel use. How in the hell is getting one of the largest oil wealth nations in the world on board a bad thing? They see the coming sea change!
2033 2018-08-12 18:49:33 Looks like solid wood? If so my personal taste would be just sand it & give it a wax or oil finish. YMMV.

2037 2018-08-12 18:48:59 It was Messier and Peplinski during the 1986 Series against the Flames...pretty sure it was during Game 2.
2038 2018-08-12 18:48:57 That's good!  I know you can for sure get it in tincture & vape oil form in NY state now.  I wish MMJ programs in every state would allow use of the entire flower, separating only two cannabinoids and saying they are the only ones that help is ridic. THC-only is not good for ppl
2039 2018-08-12 18:48:41 I can barely understand this, but we don’t use that soup bs. Oil, Onions, maggi, tomato paste, pepper, rice. All you really need
2040 2018-08-12 18:48:37 Imagine a world where oil is worthless. Energy is generated without combustion of gasoline. How powerful would the Saudi Arabia be then. We need to move away from an oil driven economy.
2041 2018-08-12 18:48:37 @beautybakerie Can you guys post an in depth tutorial on how to properly use the foundation? I’m trying so hard to love it but it breaks apart on my skin so easily and doesn’t stick. I have the #WakeAndBake face oil and nothing works. Please help! I really want to like it.
2042 2018-08-12 18:48:36 What we need is a Greenpeace black ops team to do surgical strikes on Big Pharma, Big Oil & the Big Babies that run things. Universal minimum wage of $15/hr CAD would be nice too.
2043 2018-08-12 18:48:36 Madden is so sweaty right now.  P.S Antonio Brown is anointed in oil.
2044 2018-08-12 18:48:36 That male Congressman was, and depressingly still is, my Senator. The only thing that dude knows is where to meet the oil & gas lobbyists to discuss his campaign contributions and other perks of selling out.
2045 2018-08-12 18:48:35 SOYINKA! this is the recent report in the country: NNPC claims it lost N111.42 billion worth of crude oil and products in its custody between 2015 - 2017. This is separate from the N427 billion it claimed as financial losses incurred at its corporate headquarters alone. SPEAK OUT
2046 2018-08-12 18:48:31 @ShitJokes what’s the only bit that Popeye doesn’t get rusty ? The bit he puts in olive oil . Probably up her arse .
2047 2018-08-12 18:48:25 Aren't those the same guys banned from the WWII memorial because that petulant oaf Oblahblah closed an open air installation as revenge for shutting down the gov't?
2048 2018-08-12 18:48:12 The coconut oil has begun to solidify. I guess the heatwave is over.

Hi, Kelly  -  Regarding Diabetes... You may want to research Tumeric...  Unrefined Coconut Oil... and Cinnamon.   I believe each of these properties has proven helpful to maintain stable blood-sugar levels.  Take care.
2051 2018-08-12 18:48:06 Sir please predict the range of Oil Prices as well !
2052 2018-08-12 18:47:59 It was the olive oil speaking, it gets the best of us
2053 2018-08-12 18:47:32 Do you buy groceries do you drive a car that runs on petroleum if you answer yes than you are voting for oil use with your dollars
2054 2018-08-12 18:47:26 The economy certainly was volotile, but all the more interesting that Nixon approval had flattened by Oct ‘73. Oil embargo started that month, and while market trended down in 73 the big drop was after approval flattened.
2055 2018-08-12 18:47:04 They put oil on him if I’m not mistaken

2059 2018-08-12 18:46:47 He paid to represent? In essence acting? 
This is the definition of #FakeNews repeating an untruth as if it is true. I realize this is opinion, not hard news, many dont differentiate btwn the two. Juan part of problem, not solution spreading disinformation
2060 2018-08-12 18:46:29 I love it when our "Disney Prince" shows the #Disney side of himself. It's so cute! Hugs for "Oil Tot'
2061 2018-08-12 18:46:26 You been watching too many movies and actually believing them too. If $TSLA shorts don’t see $2 Billion purchase as a warning sign to get out, then they deserve to lose another $3 billion. Bloomberg isn’t making up story about Saudi’s Fund wanting to hedge against oil investment
2062 2018-08-12 18:46:26 Hillary LIAR OBAMA FRAUD Allowed ISIS Sale Oil In Open Market,Liar Obama Created Oficialy ISIS Name For ISIS, He Made 200.000.000 People Homeless Living In Tents @PressSec @Varneyco @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @LouDobbs @Varneyco @DevinNunes
2063 2018-08-12 18:46:14 “Someday” coming to you much quicker than you think. 2 decades. Which makes long term big dollar spending in oil infrastructure  a very very risky venture.
2064 2018-08-12 18:46:08 As for your oil issue, have you tried coffee grounds? Alternatively you could use activated charcoal. At least from what I remember.
2065 2018-08-12 18:46:04 Eish...... Yes there are food speculators. People have made and lost millions speculating on food. Egusi, maize, guinea corn, palm oil, etc, mostly non perishable food stuff. They buy in season, store and sell in the off season when they expect prices to be higher.
2066 2018-08-12 18:46:03 That’s interesting I was surprised by the boy who had 50 fits a day but with the cannabis oil they got the fits down to one a day and even none a day it’s amazing 
2067 2018-08-12 18:45:52 Who knew getting oil for my car would prove to be so difficult?
2068 2018-08-12 18:45:51 Sources within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tell me that @bronzeagemantis is set to become the next Guardian of the Ark. He will watch over it nude except for a coating of coconut oil. Powerful!
2069 2018-08-12 18:45:46 @realDonaldTrump we have the RU's blocked in so they can't sell oil to anyone. They're getting frustrated and angry.
2070 2018-08-12 18:45:45 Snake oil sales men like yourself selling the Trump agenda to the African American Community
2071 2018-08-12 18:45:29 ¿Tendrá sobre la mesa el tema de los drones? y la bendición celestial?

2074 2018-08-12 18:44:54 There are a lot of things you could say about #Afflicted on #Netflix but two things that stand out is how commercial #health is and how profitable alternative medicine and #homeopathy are. Snake Oil sales alive and well.
2075 2018-08-12 18:44:48 Everyone n their moms gettin an oil change today I see
2076 2018-08-12 18:44:44 These wildfires remind me, this is a really good time to start getting more oil and gas money into the @DNC.
2077 2018-08-12 18:44:13 I’m asking cuz guy I met in 87 had his head in the stars. I wore press badge & College Dems sticker so he sat & talked w/me & my photog @ Iowa DemConv. Knew I couldn’t vote 4 him cuz his energy was “Ivory Tower”. Belongs in academia. Trying 2mesh that w/Armand/Ru/oil ties.
2078 2018-08-12 18:43:40 Cutting regulations helps big banks, big oil/chemical and others who don't want to play by the rules that protect the environment and people. As each day goes by, we are being taken advantage of by big banks and our health is being put at risk by big polluters.

2084 2018-08-12 18:43:07 You mean crude oil
2085 2018-08-12 18:43:02 This is a clip in love but I use the tresemme bontanique range and I deep condition with the hair mayonnaise. I use the aunt Jackie leave in conditioner after I wash and moisturize my hair with castor oil and coconut oil
2086 2018-08-12 18:42:59 It's an alternative to sun drying. Salt lightly then at least 3 hours in the oven on a wire rack on a very low heat. Delia props to oven door open slightly to avoid cooking. Then seal in a jar with olive oil. There are various methods but that's essentially it. Serve at leisure!
2087 2018-08-12 18:42:58 Does oil really needs to be hedged ?
2088 2018-08-12 18:42:39 Lol na today I even give tailor
2089 2018-08-12 18:42:29 Of course it is.  The old snake oil trick, making a living from the gullible.

2094 2018-08-12 18:42:07 Double standards, havana chavanokwanisa kuita vana US. Remember ka the Arms & Power Security guarantee to the Saudi King by USA in return for Saudi oil being sold in USDs & Saudi Arabia investing oil receipts in US bonds that was entered way back during Richard Nixon?

Surely it's an act and you can't be that stupid and earn as much as they do spewing nonsense
2097 2018-08-12 18:41:59 Doing my oil change, easy but such a bitch
2098 2018-08-12 18:41:42 @elerianm Is Russia strong enough (oil price is high ;)) to launch an economic war via financial assets?

Also, grated and mixed with the tomato sauce and/or cottage cheese, in a veggie lasagna.

2108 2018-08-12 18:40:27 I didn't make a video about what I was eating to try to conceive, I just have a video about what I was eating to try to gain weight. I was eating a lot of coconut oil though to make sure I was getting enough fats because I became allergic to avocado.
2109 2018-08-12 18:40:26 Maybe @Busisa74 can assist on this. My sources say "Rusape Oil Company"... another "Rusape Oil Refinery" I think that the URL name came with the Federation/CAF business environment and the Bulawayo industrial boom due to the city's strategic location in the fed ... not sure.

2135 2018-08-12 18:37:36 A quick calculation shows that stopping Norwegian oil production (assuming all carbon therein is converted to CO2) has a similar effect on the climate to stopping all Californian CO2 production.
2136 2018-08-12 18:37:35 The Iranian Regime is reshaping in a position where the citizens will overthrow them because these sanctions suffocate them. As there is no proper food, the economy is in disaster, The export of oil and natural gas is minusculed in 2018 and moreover the money has been siphoned..

2206 2018-08-12 18:31:07 I dont see the "lumping" on the right. Maybe I'm biased? Left seems to lump all whites, trump voters into a pigeonhole. In my mind I see any personal criticism of an individual limited to that person, not the entire group they share a skin tone with.

2213 2018-08-12 18:30:29 Is that what Trump and Putin discussed in a one-on-one meeting? By pushing  Iran sanction and  Turkey sanction the US is helping the russian tyrant go regain oil driven economy and create new alliances, when the US is loosing advantage of NATO. Great job suckers.

2215 2018-08-12 18:30:13 The starting pitching for the Brewers has leaked sole oil all year and done there best to put band aids on it. It seems like the floodgates are opening and the only thing that will stop it would be a trade.

2217 2018-08-12 18:30:05 Vape oil distillate. Convenient, easy, and tailored to your needs. Terpene infused. Lab tested and ratio.
2218 2018-08-12 18:29:33 Allowing Energy East to be built without attaching downstream emissions to it (which imported oil is exempt from BTW), is a far cry from legislating a lower than market price for Alberta oil (NEP).

This bowl of food is filling, high in #protein and most importantly it was enjoyable.

2223 2018-08-12 18:29:14 Yeah not since Al Gore sold current tv to oil funded Al Jazeera has the irony meter pegged so high.  Can’t wait to read Electrek’s spin on it.  Fred and Musk wearing keffiyehs and mirrored sunglasses.   ‘Just think of the solar panel and power wall potential in Saudi’s Arabia’

2227 2018-08-12 18:28:47 the far left and far right have more in common than the middle might think. we both want to destroy things. one enemy we all hate is big oil. only the distracted middle defends big oil. the middle and almost middle can go f**k themselves.

2234 2018-08-12 18:27:37 Oh I agree. This is all media/Twitter driven along with Elba’s fans. Within the actual Bond fan base there is no statistically significant amount lobbying for Idris. Cavill, Turner, Hardy all get mentioned, but not Idris. However, the squeaky wheel does get the oil.
2235 2018-08-12 18:27:32 For many progressive voters, the climate emergency is a defining issue. They won’t vote for Dems beholden to #fossilfuel interests. Is taking oil/gas $ a winning strategy for @DNC? I believe not.
That’s all I am saying. Winning requires $ but also votes.
2236 2018-08-12 18:27:22 this oil i’ve been vaping has 700mg
2237 2018-08-12 18:27:15 Like talk to me when you stop paying for a Military Industrial Complex to invade foreign countries for oil.
2238 2018-08-12 18:27:15 There's an ocean of difference between building Energy East and an upgrade to allow Alberta oil to be used in central Canada instead of importing it (energy independence) and legislating a lower than world market price for Alberta oil (NEP). #ableg #cdnpoli

Might come in handy for my next all company meeting  ;-)
2242 2018-08-12 18:26:51 Arguments are so superficial and simplistic. 
Watched Juan Williams argue Trump attack on James was an attack on all blacks just bcse he's black. Is Juan really that dumb or just acting? Serious question.
2243 2018-08-12 18:26:45 Zinke's way of "managing" forests is to sell off chunks of our national treasures to oil/gas interests for profit. We have to stop building in wild land areas which would eliminate the property loss issue. We also have to mitigate climate change, which is also impacting fires...
2244 2018-08-12 18:26:22 It’s happening! I think the issue is  he thinks we are dependent on oil for cars .. hey check it out ..  @alabdalir66  account says he’s from my home city Toronto lol
2245 2018-08-12 18:26:14 Recently switched to using shea butter in my hair instead of coconut oil and I'm never going back.
2246 2018-08-12 18:26:12 The Trump Administration has endangered our environment. Congress sat by idly as President Trump pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement and as Scott Pruitt actively worked to dismantle the EPA and open our public lands and waters to new oil and gas drilling. (1/2)

2255 2018-08-12 18:24:55 Processing of rapeseed for oil production produces rapeseed meal. A high-protein animal feed. The feed is employed mostly for cattle feeding, but also for pigs and chickens. - wiki.. but yes it also is used for edible vegetable oils, and biodiesel
2256 2018-08-12 18:24:48 The problem with SOV is that demand is elastic and has many substitute goods like oil, equity, real estate, etc. 

I'd rather own a coin with lots of ineleastic demand and no substitute goods.

2261 2018-08-12 18:23:27 Burying it in the schedule by putting it up against semis was arguably a slap in the face to the women in the activity, and at best showed @DCI ’s true priorities. I trust they will #dobetter. There’s plenty of available space in Lucas Oil. Consider the rental fee an investment.
2262 2018-08-12 18:23:16 We are selling weapons to the Saudis. They put up oil prices. UK public pay increase prices, so Saudis are getting weapons played for by us. These weapons are then used to kill innocent people!

2265 2018-08-12 18:22:12 Sunday Riley's UFO oil is the only thing I've found effective on hormone-related pimples that are under the skin. Start taking Vitamin A and Zinc supplements too. Again, great for reducing inflammation from hormones.
2266 2018-08-12 18:22:00 Pretty sure it's like @Retrobiker1 said, just dry, can see the grooves in the bushings that would do it, and not a fat lot of oil came out the spring side. Gona get some float oil and top up the air chamber too. They feel nice and smooth now mind.
2267 2018-08-12 18:21:33 Is big dick energy the company that had that oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico?
2268 2018-08-12 18:21:19 Russia look like great and oil price is rising. This news for Russia quite good.
2269 2018-08-12 18:20:50 Do you think if oil rig workers made videos of coming home they'd get as much attention as soldiers do for their videos?
2270 2018-08-12 18:20:33 And I don't want my tax dollars giving subsidies to oil companies and giving unreasonable breaks to the wealthiest 1%, but they do.
2271 2018-08-12 18:20:17 I think all those years of being in Utd's shadow has really affected City supporters. now that they're powered by oil money and have the chance to finally become a big club, the desperation is really coming out. just like Spurs fans.
2272 2018-08-12 18:20:13 Addendum:
Since 8/5/18, been giving my cats heavy Mineral oil (Mixed w/ canned food) 1/4 teaspoon for TWO cats/day. (They were getting omega 3 oil 1/4 tsp / day) & variable amounts of the "Vaseline" type junk. IMO mineral oil seems to really help hair balls. (touch wood)
2273 2018-08-12 18:20:08 I'm guessing that Claire &Nightmare(who allegedly gets turned on by 15 y old girls) will find what TYT did, what the Intercept did etc were very patriotic to help out the CIA &an oil company & that they werent pathetic pussies/hippies standing along w/ 'stupid' Native Americans.
2274 2018-08-12 18:20:03 RT @LS_Nutrition: Drinks marked as "healthy" or "natural" can be packed with sugar and even oil! This August, read labels carefully.

2278 2018-08-12 18:19:41 Thankful for a man that loves cars and makes sure mine is taken care of as well. He’s now changed my oil, washed and waxed it, and is currently putting gas in it cuz he found out I was down to half a tank. 
2279 2018-08-12 18:19:39 ไม่แนะนำให้ใช้แทน cleansing oil ค่ะ หากเอาไปเช็ดทำความสะอาดทั้งหน้า เพราะจะมันมาก หากผิวหน้ามันอยู่แล้ว ยิ่งเหนอะเข้าไปอีกค่ะ แค่เช็ดอายไลน์เนอร์และลิปสติกก็พอค่ะ

2291 2018-08-12 18:17:49 Oil and gas can be imported from Iran and paid for in Turkish liras or Iranians riyals in an agreement between Turkey and Iran. And the same can be done with other nations such as China.

2295 2018-08-12 18:17:25 $2.7 billion are spent on importing edible oil, local production is only 14%.

2322 2018-08-12 18:13:30 Any oil revenue from unknown region is attributed to Scotland in GERs. There are no revenues derived from unknown region exports so why would it be shown in GERs? These exports would be relevant to GDP calculations - except the SG compile their own and don't use this data.
2323 2018-08-12 18:13:30 Safe long term imo. The risk was not if theres oil but more the gas. We now know needs sidetracking. Fine. The oil is there/recoverable, need patience to prove up the fields and get those wells in. Producing cash though now so for all the haters ‘cash is king’ more wells  SP

2327 2018-08-12 18:12:58 Bahaha this olive oil comparison is the best thing I've heard all day. There is absolutely no way you are being serious....right?
2328 2018-08-12 18:12:56 Yeah I'm not feeling too optimistic about this currently :) I agree that doing something is better than doing nothing, and I have great respect for people that are trying to do something. There do seem to be efforts for "sustainable palm oil" underway, so that's something.

2330 2018-08-12 18:12:46 Venezuela owes debts denominated in foreign currency.  It relies on oil revenue to make those payments.  Oil prices crashed.  (It also suffers from a long history of poor governance and other stuff).  America never borrows in a foreign currency.

I walk over and the thing is on fire (just a small fire, oil was dripping onto the heating thinga majig) , so I'm like yo! Fire!
2342 2018-08-12 18:11:02 4. Add 1tbs of coconut oil and mix
well.
5. Wash your face and neck
with warm water and an oil-free
cleanser to cleanse your face
and open pores.

2344 2018-08-12 18:10:49 Then why is our deficit exploding? 4% growth has NOT translated into prosperity for workers or the country!! You are nothing more than a corporate shill, and a cheerleader for the wealthy. You have bamboozled 49% of the country but 60% of us see you as a snake oil salesmen.
2345 2018-08-12 18:10:41 It’s not occurring to his fan base yet that you are what you do, not what you say. He’s basically a snake oil salesman, and his fans are marks.

2354 2018-08-12 18:10:30 Do we really need the #Americans to have our backs on this one? Canada has our own oil. It should be as easy as, it was nice knowing you, Saudi's. No? #Canada is the second largest country in the #World. We should have been using our own oil and gas, from day 1. @billmaher
2355 2018-08-12 18:10:30 We in Alberta strive to buy Canadian 1st. That means we buy & support BC, Ontario & Quebec products. But the "sons a bitches" will not support Alberta or Albertans.

2357 2018-08-12 18:10:14 @TomPerez Tom, 2 days ago, why did REVERSE the resolution to no longer accept money from the oil industry? I resent your lack of leadership in this regard. Do you not know that when you choose WE THE PEOPLE, we will follow. Eco-Economics & Eco-Tech is our future. You reek of oil.
2358 2018-08-12 18:10:14 Glory! Fresh oil! Fresh anointing! Head to toes!

2374 2018-08-12 18:07:52 And the price of oil was...? : )
2375 2018-08-12 18:07:52 In fairness, the bland definition of “mayonnaise” in America — eggs and oil whipped together, and that’s it — came to us via English culture.
2376 2018-08-12 18:07:36 Oh if that happens there’s no hesitation; imma just toss it in the fireplace. Callin a priest or someone, we dousing the place in holy oil and the whole place goin up in flames 
2377 2018-08-12 18:07:31 Do you think any politician is totally clean? Maybe JEC, I'd like to think. Bush41/43 CIA,oil business, MLB no way, WJC we all know better. BHO, Chicago political machine/IL Senator sure totally clean
2378 2018-08-12 18:07:28 This is a old trick that I remember an oil exec did when they protested at their house in England - can’t remember exact details though...

2386 2018-08-12 18:06:45 Plastic comes from trees? I know that it's possible to make plastic from trees but I thought most plastics are still made from oil
2387 2018-08-12 18:06:38 100% olive oil? Doesn't this get bitter? I was always taught that agitating olive oil too much isn't good and that I should use a neutral oil for the base and add olive towards the end
2388 2018-08-12 18:06:36 Been wondering the same. I think the hierarchy goes: Freedom, Harley-Davidson, leather, chrome, motor oil, rock and roll... then maybe POTUS. #knowyourplace
2389 2018-08-12 18:06:33 I’m sorry that you fell for the propaganda machine, hopefully one day you find out the truth. I am interested in knowing your thoughts on Saudi oil, and what we can do to reduce our usage of fossil fuels

2392 2018-08-12 18:06:21 I own a copy but have never read it. I did read *The Harbinger* when it was the craze, and though the writing was lackluster, it did keep the attention. My pick would probably be *Oil!* by Upton Sinclair. I’ve never finished it because the plot was so ridiculous.
2393 2018-08-12 18:06:15 No one cares what else Abramovich spends his looted oil billions on, or what Fulham’s Kahn spends his billions on, etc, etc. Don’t remember any discussions on motd about those - cos it’s not relevant.
2394 2018-08-12 18:06:14 He knows better doesn’t care. He knows it’s real but the big oil machine owns him. Just like the NRA. He was tough talker awhile ago then the next morning kissing their ass. He’s a coward.
2395 2018-08-12 18:06:09 •use coconut oil. pour coconut oil on your teeth and swish it around for about 15 minutes. then, spit it out and rinse with cold water. use once a day until you start seeing results
2396 2018-08-12 18:05:59 Antiguans and Montserratians get on bad together but are like oil and water in the long run.
2397 2018-08-12 18:05:47 Inform him that you can't put out a fire by throwing oil on it.
2398 2018-08-12 18:05:34 As does Peterson. We wouldn’t call him a snake oil salesman just because he espouses some which we don’t agree with.

2400 2018-08-12 18:05:16 Hmm. Good question. I don’t know of a good substitute for the oil in the spray, but you can perchase some dried lavender sachets and slip those in your pillow cases! People on Etsy sell cute ones, or their not difficult to make yourself if you’re crafty.

2407 2018-08-12 18:03:10 Peppermint oil helps a lot. If you put some behind your ears and on your neck, it'll help you sleep better. That's what I do.
2408 2018-08-12 18:02:55 I worked with a bunch of engineers.  One looked like Kim Bassinger and was also a fine artist - watercolors, oil, etc.  The absolute hatred some women had for her was shocking.  Only because she was so beautiful and talented.  Her grace was very impressive.
2409 2018-08-12 18:02:43 •us coconut oil. pour coconut oil on your teeth and  swish it around for about 15 minutes. spit it out and rinse your mouth with cool water. do this once a day until you start seeing results

2412 2018-08-12 18:02:16 With the caveat that I'm not a socialist and not trying to justify it, Venezuela is essentially a one-industry country, so even before they went off the cliff, its growth are recessions were tied to oil price fluctuations.
2413 2018-08-12 18:02:16 Way too early to call it. Will take Emery sometime but what I saw in that second half was encouraging. That oil team is just so good, every player worth like £50mil. #Arsenal #ARSMCI

2419 2018-08-12 18:01:14 whatever u quoted was dumb as hell... we need oil to start in the central midfield... outwide he can't take players on and leaves the outside back alone to defend.. we need a winger thats really it right now lol

2421 2018-08-12 18:01:12 Coconut oil is a blessing.
2422 2018-08-12 18:01:04 He definitely has made many question why we are not oil independent when we could be. Could he be trying to gain support to revisit Energy East? I think you give him to much credit honestly.
2423 2018-08-12 18:01:01 Palm oil is everywhere and I don't think boycotting those products will hurt the big food companies a single bit. The volume of consumers boycotting those products is just too low. So I disagree. The only way out is if policy makers and big players step up and take responsibility
2424 2018-08-12 18:01:00 Preppers don't look so crazy now with this crazy man in the White House. War with China will be a long and expensive failure. Fresh water is the new Oil.

2428 2018-08-12 17:59:54 There's a considerable amount of oil or diesel or something spilled all the way down kelty high street, station road and on the front road to cowdenbeath. Runs out just as you get to beath, but it's making the car tyres really slippy.

2430 2018-08-12 17:59:39 money is not an issue. money is printed on paper. physical reality is the issue. i don't care if propping up oil companies is profitable. they need to be destroyed. after they are gone, we can pull together to feed heal and shelter.
2431 2018-08-12 17:59:38 Wow and you guys want to be the government.  

Simple question. When was the last time the government or any politician bought oil from any country?

If you don't realize that private companies are the ones buying foreign oil, you really are not ready for prime time
2432 2018-08-12 17:59:24 @TheVeganZombie - By the way, how's the #NoSalt #NoOil diet going lately? Will you be sticking with it permanently or plan to slowly reintroduce #Salt and #Oil back into your meals?  #Vegan #VeganLife #VeganZombie #ZombieLife 
2433 2018-08-12 17:59:21 Gdp calculation
Nominal Gdp(NGDP) less adjust for inflation (I) 
In 2013 Gdp was 5%
NGDP 12% less In 7%

2016 Gdp was 7%
NGDP was 4.8% less In - 2.2%

Consumer price index was negative since 2014 due to drop in crude oil

Another reason why back dated Gdp  not published by govt

2446 2018-08-12 17:57:47 No chocolate, sugar, salt, coffee, nuts, oil or citrus fruits. The only fruit would be berries and maybe crabapples. Lettuce only in the summer. Lots of root veggies and game meat. Honey for sweetening. Maybe some local oats, wheat and barley.

2453 2018-08-12 17:57:09 As I said in my tweet. Keep justifying it if u must. But you’re contributing. There’s no such thing as sustainable palm oil. It’s corrupt. Destroying the forest and encourages child labour.
2454 2018-08-12 17:56:58 We did the same with a mate of mine. He was dared to drink a whole bottle of olive oil. He did, and said he didn't have a solid shit for a week

2456 2018-08-12 17:56:49 What can we use instead of lavender oil if we have cats? I always want to make linen sprays but I have to avoid the essential oils because of my pets.
2457 2018-08-12 17:55:58 4. Add 1tbs of coconut oil and mix well.
5. Wash your face and neck with warm water and an oil-free cleanser to cleanse your face and open pores.
2458 2018-08-12 17:55:47 twitter doctors:  where do you stand on essential oils like tea tree oil and lavender?  is the estrogenic and antiandrogenic concern a real thing?  OK for my kids and patients or no??  Thank you for helping an orthopedic surgeon be a safe mom!!

2461 2018-08-12 17:54:48 The transission is bigger than Saudis. If you were an oil billionaire it would make perfect sense to prepare to become a battery/solar/EV billionaire in the future.

3. Mix until you’ve made a paste.
2465 2018-08-12 17:54:20 I mean, it is. But it also isn’t. It’s an existential state. I feel like on a governmental level nations believing in progress are keeping themselves quiet to maintain some kind of “economic stability” but isn’t honesty and integrity of greater real value than, say, gold or oil?
2466 2018-08-12 17:53:50 yeah I used to put mad oil on my edges and brush it out
2467 2018-08-12 17:53:47 It's interesting after 100s of years of unofficial affirmative action, 2 listen to so many people complain about attempts 2 level the playing field 4 people while they call it creating dependency yet not a word about farm & oil company subsidies & every kind of corporate welfare.

Saudi exports to North America are AFAIK marginal, to Europe substantial, to Asia substantial and growing. SA's ability to affect Western economy should be much smaller than 40 years ago, but still there. As EU's economy keeps diversifying SA's role will continue to fall.

2477 2018-08-12 17:52:55 Dawn, do you have lotion? No, but i do have coconut oil.
2478 2018-08-12 17:52:53 Dilema whether to work or not tomorrow. Wanted to go since I reach home early than expected but I'm not feeling well at the moment. Stomachache and headache. Am I too old for burning midnight oil?
2479 2018-08-12 17:52:50 Yes.  Imagine how much good could be done in this country if we redeployed the billions in annual corporate welfare given to big Pharma, big Ag,& big Oil.
2480 2018-08-12 17:52:40 I know plenty about Alex. 

He's a dishonest snake oil sales man.

He abuses his power and money to get what he wants.

He doesn't deserve the defenders he has on line!
2481 2018-08-12 17:52:29 Lol okay and I’m about to text you cause you and Charles are like oil and vinegar lol
2482 2018-08-12 17:52:26 Unku kamdan
2483 2018-08-12 17:52:04 While our last no standing allies buy gas and oil from Russia. NATO was designed to go against countries like Russia. While Germany plays footsies with Russia. Get your facts straight. #FactsMatter
2484 2018-08-12 17:52:00 Women will have a car and not change the oil once during the whole time they owned it....engine be ready to hop out the car and leave
2485 2018-08-12 17:51:57 -INGREDIENTS

.Coconut oil
.Oatmeal
.Warm water
2486 2018-08-12 17:51:47 The real problem we have as Muslims is that we see and hear but we do not respond. For example, our ancestors were not educated and were poor when Aramco came my father learned English but now things have changed. English has become a second language, because of oil 
2487 2018-08-12 17:51:30 I just finished watching Lorenzo's Oil for one of our subjects and pota dami kong iyak iyakin ko gudbye
2488 2018-08-12 17:51:29 I forgot how amazing coconut oil feels on the skin
2489 2018-08-12 17:51:25 These guys aren’t alt right they’re alt-snake oil
2490 2018-08-12 17:51:18 Just to be clear, I'm no Trump supporter either. America has itself to blame for buying the snake oil that both candidates pandered during the electoral sideshow. No-one was going to come out unscathed ... and there's an apostrophe in "You'reMyBoy" if we're going to start trading
2491 2018-08-12 17:51:17 I asked you, where will MC be without the OIL , answer that and then get some of the cocaine I use
2492 2018-08-12 17:51:17 It saddens me that a lot of vegan products still use palm oil 
2493 2018-08-12 17:50:55 Depends how many sensors you need - I put a set on our 3m Claydon for less than £1K and it’s been invaluable.  It’s so good it alerted us to a blown fan motor seal as the oil was causing the seed to flow irregularly.  It’s peace of mind we never had a block but you always checked
2494 2018-08-12 17:50:51 In Kenya there is vegetable oil made of recycled oil unfit for human consumption.
2495 2018-08-12 17:50:50 OATMEAL & COCONUT OIL FACE MASK:

-Coconut oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties. Add to that the soothing and pH-balancing power of oatmeal l, and you’ve got an amazing recipe for clearer skin.
2496 2018-08-12 17:50:40 Difficult time awaits PTI govt, Iran fired anti ship missile resulting i soaring of oil prices,
Foreign terrorists active in Baltistan.
Terrorist activity increases in Balochistan.
USA Pakistan relations strained.
US sanctions on Iran puts Pakistan on tight rope
2497 2018-08-12 17:50:37 My baby is peeling so much i wanna dip her in coconut oil
2498 2018-08-12 17:50:36 @beautybakerie do you make any products that are coconut oil or coconut fat free??
2499 2018-08-12 17:50:34 Ba anga wataba jiya
2500 2018-08-12 17:50:24 Always deflects and driverts the truth. Phony bigoted Pitbull! How does she sleep at night working for Snake Oil Salesman Trump???
2501 2018-08-12 17:50:24 I initially mid read this tweet. Now that resolution has passed, I am resent this democratic disgrace. Big Oil is NOT the future. Sustainability Is! The acceptance of dirty money is the acceptance of dirty power. Dems, choose people over money, and the people will follow.
2502 2018-08-12 17:50:19 For a 100 years Texas was mostly governed by conservative Democrats and we had Lydon Johnson, NASA, good schools, good roads.  Oil was produced, people made money and blue collar workers could buy a home and had insurance. I'm old I remember.

2504 2018-08-12 17:49:49 I can see the trail of oil underneath it 
2505 2018-08-12 17:49:48 Except India, oil is bejng found everywhere on the planet...
It were Russians who found first crude oil basin of Mumbai High...

Why we dont take Russians help to revisit all other basins for interpretation of geophysical survey of remaining basins
2506 2018-08-12 17:49:41 Oil Change finallyyyy......smh  nigga said i had no oil in my car lmaooo
2507 2018-08-12 17:49:24 Last week, I got put on to massaging Tea Tree and Coconut Oil into my beard— it’s got my shit glowing and smelling amazing!
2508 2018-08-12 17:49:21 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
2509 2018-08-12 17:49:13 I'm imaging this and I'm very doubtful we would have removed our ambassador, pulled our students and, refused to buy your oil and sand.
2510 2018-08-12 17:49:12 It’s not that simple. Canada is self sufficient in oil, we are a net exporter. Mideast and Venezuelan oil is imported because we lack both an West-East pipeline to bring Western crude to Eastern Canada and refining capacity for heavier Western crude.
2511 2018-08-12 17:49:07 Shrekenomic’s propietary big oil indicators suggest we have officially entered bubble territory in the cognitive dissonance market
2512 2018-08-12 17:48:32 Why is anyone surprised? Seriously?!?!  It was pretty evident things like this were gonna happen sooner rather than later. Many  of the people affected were supporters of the oil fields & the pipeline.
2513 2018-08-12 17:48:29 My Vietnamese roomie cooking in fish oil is nose death for me.
2514 2018-08-12 17:48:28 Today’s weather brought to you by global warming.  Thanks to all the oil and gas workers in Alberta.
2515 2018-08-12 17:48:27 A government that pays 100% of my tuition, subsidizes electricity, oil prices, water supply, and medical care CANNOT BY ALL MEANS BE REPRESSIVE. Media keeps on picking tractors and label them as activists
2516 2018-08-12 17:48:27 @realDonaldTrump & RESPECT is like mixing OIL & WATER

2519 2018-08-12 17:48:05 last time kingfisher air deccan sahara busted with oil hi this time?
2520 2018-08-12 17:48:05 How about Canada builds refineries and uses its own oil. USA uses its own oil and The Saudi’s uses their own oil? Less transport across oceans that way as well  Less carbon footprint and it should be cheaper overall for each of the countries involved.
2521 2018-08-12 17:47:55 Ate Sardines in oil and jalapeños w/ crackers for lunch because my hatred for my intestines knows no limit.
2522 2018-08-12 17:47:51 Just had the most amazing massage. 
Full body, 1.5 hours on a heated bed with mint & rosemary essential oil.

2526 2018-08-12 17:47:23 Owned two Fords and drove one 187K miles and other 282K (both were still running great at the end but rear main bearing seals were leaking oil and too expensive to repair). Highly recommend Fords!
2527 2018-08-12 17:46:54 I put oil on after the shower in ages cos it’s basically winter now

2529 2018-08-12 17:46:47 And maybe also the oil itself, but I’d make a recipe
2530 2018-08-12 17:46:42 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2531 2018-08-12 17:46:36 เห็นมั้ย ออยก็ต้องกินเยอะๆ
2532 2018-08-12 17:46:35 if burning the midnight oil means studying. What is the phrase for eating ? 
2533 2018-08-12 17:46:34 Your fake u women abusers!!!! I can be whatever I want to be I live in Canada I have a voice unlike your women or people. Our aboriginal people are getting help now u have no idea. We have plenty of oil thank you!
2534 2018-08-12 17:46:33 It was Mr. Argyle in the brewery with the beard oil.
2535 2018-08-12 17:46:31 I mean, eventually it's the big food companies that use palm oil because it's cheaper for them and more profit is going to be made. I'd say quit the palm oil and keep your profits, just make the products more expensive. But no company will do that because competition.
2536 2018-08-12 17:46:25 That’s it! He’s lost his everlovin mind! It’s #FakeNews
2537 2018-08-12 17:46:25 Anyone ever wonder if it’s already too late to save the environment but we’re fed a false sense of hope to keep the world sane? And that’s why trump doesn’t gaf about drilling for oil in/near national parks in our last days? Bc same

2544 2018-08-12 17:45:23 Nope, the reason the oil industry has seen a drop in investment is that oil sands mega-projects were completed and that tends to lead to a lull in investment - also oil investment currently favours shale plays. There is also the issue of bottlenecks with some resolution in sight.

2547 2018-08-12 17:45:00 If those farmers are Republican (most likely), they approved of the oil drilling so, Boo fucking Hoo!
2548 2018-08-12 17:44:58 Well I’m working for a major service company for a major oil and gas company, so no weaponry allowed.

2559 2018-08-12 17:43:50 Paying back or defaulting.  Of course, China/Russian as sovereign USD creditors means they can cover for China/Russia/other EM private sector USD debtors - see China taking over Total portion of Iran oil field for example.  Associated USD debt issue can then be resolved easier

2570 2018-08-12 17:42:01 Because they are?

Slow fried white onion & celery, parsnip, carrot in sunflower oil. Add tinned bortelotti beans. Add chicken stock. Gently reduce. Mash with potato masher. Do not add salt or pepper, use dried oregano if you must.
2571 2018-08-12 17:41:49 So going to the apostles the apostles don't sell bands or anointing oil they use stones they can tell you to put it in water instead of using oil we use stones which u dont need to buy it there is a special service they tell you to bring your own milk and they will pray for it
2572 2018-08-12 17:41:45 Try the peanut oil and clear bowl trick. It’s disgusting but it works.

2575 2018-08-12 17:41:19 Had one.   The Japanese won the motorcycle race years ago.   Was talked out of getting a Yamaha at the time.   HD do have a great image, but a few years back the new ones had a piece of cardboard underneath at showroom for oil drips.

2581 2018-08-12 17:40:34 Na, it’s owned by two Texas oil billionaires.
2582 2018-08-12 17:40:27 Ahhh-  But Tesla is begging to be saved by the Saudis-  how does that fit into your "Evil Oil" diatribe?  YOU are now supporting Big Oil, genius......

2590 2018-08-12 17:39:04 Russia Finance Minister: We May Abandon Dollar In Oil Trade As It Is Becoming "Too Risky"
 
"We have significantly reduced our investment in US assets. In fact, the dollar, which is considered to be the international currency, becomes a risky tool for payments."
2591 2018-08-12 17:38:49 Omarosa is a cautionary tale. For generations to come, black folk will gather around holograms of fire to tell the story of the be-weaved grifter who tried to “slick a can of oil.” In the end, she had neither employment nor community.
2592 2018-08-12 17:38:39 Wait until you taste Calicut chips (that too "Kumari" brand). Five variables (1) fresh coconut oil (2) ripeness of plantain (3) thickness of the cut (4) temp of oil (5) amount of salt added to the hot chips. Kumari chips people have found found optimal mix of all five variables
2593 2018-08-12 17:38:26 That is gorgeous. Timeless. Oil painting like. Love it.
2594 2018-08-12 17:38:19 My Bro in law designs & builds Oil rigs..now retired 4 yrs but he has been decrying that myth for decades. He is a Sunderland man Living in Newlands in Glasgow,  FERVENT Indy supporter..AND don't Mention Jim Murphy in his presence! :D
2595 2018-08-12 17:38:13 without the USA helping,us that oil will become theirs anytime they want to take it over! People like you think it's hip and trendy to poke the bear!! But piss off the bear and they will take over whatever they want!!! And you are the vet, so tell me how we would ever stop them

2604 2018-08-12 17:37:47 They always new about the oil. Like the McCrone report they were keeping it from the Scottish people.
2605 2018-08-12 17:37:44 This could be it. Most automotive fluids are dark - engine oil, brake fluid, etc. Doesn't look like any of those.
2606 2018-08-12 17:37:42 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
2607 2018-08-12 17:37:35 Also, 15+ Manuka honey has SAVED my oily skin! It turns out my skin was overproducing oil bc it was dry, and I actually have combo skin. Honey is a humectant so it attracts moisture throughout the day & should help lessen your oil production, plus it’s super antibacterial!!!

2609 2018-08-12 17:37:24 waiting to oil paint to be at least a bit dry just to put another layer on it is harder than waiting for yoongi to post

2611 2018-08-12 17:37:02 Haha, yes. Another sign of an EM crisis - Hanke selling his love of ccy boards as a modern day cure-all snake oil remedy. (“Ccy in freefall and banking sector imploding? You need a ccy board”)
2612 2018-08-12 17:36:53 IF yo had read the Growth Commission Report, which you clearly haven't It doesn't include OIL revenues in any of their recommended options to grow the Scottish economy, they are all based on putting oil revenue into an oil fund, like Norway did and it's now £2biillion
2613 2018-08-12 17:36:47 Can you explain how importing oil from halfway around the world is better for the environment than using oil from Western Canada?
2614 2018-08-12 17:36:30 Snctns are Americans' bzns. We as a nation with our big heads must soldier on, be successful n stick it in their faces.

2622 2018-08-12 17:35:43 maybe we can get the oil companies to pay for it, Tom. And Medicare for All. And books in schools. You think you can get your rich friends to do that now?
2623 2018-08-12 17:35:37 Sources tell me Rizki is in Montreal getting his hair done and having his Audi's oil changed

2625 2018-08-12 17:35:12 LOL..   plus the oil soaked snacks. I can't seem to move past our first night in camp and the morning after. We suffered man.
2626 2018-08-12 17:35:12 For 16 years you and your fellow criminals looted more than $800 billion dollars oil funds. That injury rob on every Nigerian till today. Think of returning your loots before we can listen and reason with you @OfficialPDPNig.
2627 2018-08-12 17:35:09 Pretty! Usually when my colors faded to a light green because I had blue/turqoise, I'll throw on my purple again(the argan oil one) and let it fade lighter to a almost silver.. sometimes itll fix the green undertone
2628 2018-08-12 17:35:06 Oil Seed Rape isnt really a lightland crop...which incidentally tends to be the sort of land where farmers do have irrigation. I don't know a single farmer who has been able to irrigate OSR before for grain fill.
2629 2018-08-12 17:35:04 “Arabang ka spiti the oil is burning”

2630 2018-08-12 17:35:00 Visa sorted for Azerbaijan mate.. Honestly didnt think they let dickheads like me in yeno haha. Roll on having a bath in crude oil in Nov.

2633 2018-08-12 17:34:26 When you realise the sweets you've bought - which you love - contain palm oil. #dilemma 
2634 2018-08-12 17:34:18 @realDonaldTrump @MNazerfassihi : Mr Trump your body Putin and China will sell Iranian oil. By acquiring %49 share of Caspian oil from Iran.
2635 2018-08-12 17:34:10 ok so there are 3 things my car needs:
an oil change
new generator belt 
new spark plugs
2636 2018-08-12 17:33:55 KSA isn't that stupid. They know the oil economy isn't forever. At a minimum they are hedging.
2637 2018-08-12 17:33:51 Japanese bikes a million times better.., change the oil, change your tires regularly and ride...  Harley been screwing Americans for decades, selling crap under made in u.s.a. no better than a libtard
2638 2018-08-12 17:33:36 I love the look of this - except I’d sauté the onions separately to bring out their sweetness & I’d use olive oil over rapeseed as it’s healthier (doesn’t oxidise at room temperature).
2639 2018-08-12 17:33:07 for the first time ever, I was the one to change the oil from my car...smh y’all hoes can’t even spell mechanic
2640 2018-08-12 17:33:05 That's what happens when you dump raw sewage in to the water but oil pipe lines are bad
2641 2018-08-12 17:32:57 Just another egotistical snake oil salesman. 

I haven't heard him bring anything of real substance forward, just a bunch of flashy and empty catchphrases that he memorizes before appearing on TV. 

If this is the best Democrats can do, they will lose again.

2643 2018-08-12 17:32:50 I’m not just talking IPL.  Franchise cricket in general is one big cash cow.  Ruining T20 in the same way the oil money has ruined the EPL.  All identity has been lost.  Blast still retains that identity and it’ll be a sad day when it’s ditched for city franchised T20
2644 2018-08-12 17:32:48 The state of Alaska is offering oil companies a sneak preview on three North Slope areas it’s putting up for bid at this year’s oil and gas lease sale.

Under a tax program enacted in 2003, oil companies agreed to release exploration data to the state in exchange for tax credits
2645 2018-08-12 17:32:45 Yeah? That ermine-gland oil in a natural response that people hear justice's call you know.

2649 2018-08-12 17:32:30 That stuff grosses me out to.but then you realize mayo is just eggs and oil (and vinegar)
2650 2018-08-12 17:32:29 they can only keep stumpf so long over OUR oil before questions start being asked and then they say our oil is running out. This level of blatant lying can only persevere for so long before EVERYONE realises THEY are LYING!
2651 2018-08-12 17:32:16 @FoxNews @CNN : I have to report this illegals transferring of Iranian oil share from Caspian to Russia. So they can sell it.Dumb!
2652 2018-08-12 17:32:14 Just back from Sicily and found it to be filthy...cracked sidewalks, dirty buildings and miserable locals...with the exception of Mondello beach....will give them props on pizza and olive oil though...

2655 2018-08-12 17:31:46 Also think about our foreign relations. You think he strengthens them? We barely make shit in the US, think about our oil , steel , & other resources. Imagine if they retaliate and raise prices. Then what raises? Housing, taxes etc.
2656 2018-08-12 17:31:45 Use coconut infused castor oil, smells real good
2657 2018-08-12 17:31:41 Arsenal needs to be taken over by some rich oil money Arab owner. They need world class players, not xhaka, mustafi, and all the other deadwood.

2659 2018-08-12 17:31:34 The emotional roller-coaster of finding out that oreos are vegan but the finding out they have palm oil in them is wild ride.
2660 2018-08-12 17:31:28 Someone was allocating Oil blocs for sex, but now, PMB will allocate Oil blocs to each State of the federation, for development. Was OYEDEPO not alive during obj's regime. Useless man of dog!
2661 2018-08-12 17:31:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?
2662 2018-08-12 17:31:01 Need to go buy oil for my car and have dad change it but I don’t wanna leave my couch...
2663 2018-08-12 17:30:58 In our example the Rs and Ds have the same policy (being bought by oil companies) but only the Ds could or would understand green votes as a *withheld, protest* vote against them.
2664 2018-08-12 17:30:48 All the Scandinavian countries work more or less in the same way. Norway is the only country w oil.
2665 2018-08-12 17:30:45 Salt and pepper crackers with cottage cheese and olive oil on top will forever be my favorite snack don’t @ me
2666 2018-08-12 17:30:43 totally agree with you there.

I actually read something the other day about the Norwegian Oil Fund ... you know the fund WE should have had but Maggie disapproved! Well it turns out the Norwegian fund earns interest that's INTEREST that is much more than we get in pocket money
2667 2018-08-12 17:30:41 Lord Jesus be some oil to my scalp and a body massage

2681 2018-08-12 17:29:37 Matthew 25:3-4, 8-9. You cannot depend on anyone for the oil. You must have your own. You can’t ride on someone else’s anointing and call it your own. They who endure are called Faithful. #salvation #oil #10virgins
2682 2018-08-12 17:29:35 Flaxseed oil specifically?  Would sesame oil work?
2683 2018-08-12 17:29:28 Again Andrew explain to me how russia is benefiting when America is topping russia as world number 1 oil exporter , raised military spending to 1.4 trillion in 2 years armed Ukraine defeated Isis pulled out of the Iran deal, sanctioning russia like yeah he’s a Russian agent lol
2684 2018-08-12 17:29:24 How did the consensus about Peak Oil work out. What about mass starvation due to overpopulation? How about the bird flu pandemic?

I think you're much more likely to be right if you're an outright contrarian when it comes to a consensus and predictions of doom.
2685 2018-08-12 17:29:22 Titan has zero oil. It has gasses that for us to collect would require technology that both doesn't exist and is only found in science fiction.

2689 2018-08-12 17:28:50 Much trouble is caused these days by mistaking highly temporary artifacts of the 20th century oil, coal and gas booms as somehow essential to nature of prosperity.

Even more trouble is caused by conservative tribal identification with those artifacts as symbols of a golden age.

2695 2018-08-12 17:28:18  okay the easy way is ... get a pan , use oil or butter whichever you want .. get you 4 eggs . Crack them in a big enough bowl , get you some cinnamon put it in with the eggs . Stir it and then get bread , dip it in there make sure both sides is dipped and then let them cook
2696 2018-08-12 17:28:17 Developing countries with their oil? You're kidding, right?

Poisoning people in pain with 20th century infrastructure that forces them to keep using it? 

No different than giving a person  crack or a needle with heroin! 

Pushers of addiction, purveyors of evil, drunk on power.

2701 2018-08-12 17:27:39 Valerian. Seems like it wouldn't be as strong as CBD oil, but it's not too expensive (especially if you have a grocery outlet or dollar store). Off to church. Talk to you later.
2702 2018-08-12 17:27:18 Omarosa is trending, got what she wanted but there's bigger fish to fry first, she's just the oil to get the big fish cooking. FBI, DOJ Comey Brennan Clapper Rice Osama Rhodes Clinton  Steele DEMORATS. BURN THEM ALL.

how do I know this?

cause ever since oil first started coming ashore the RED/BLUE Tories have been telling us that our oil is running out!

If it is running out, and who are we to question our Lords and Masters, then this article is all LIES unless ....

2744 2018-08-12 17:23:03 About to start the stream, just finished changing the oil in my gaming chair. Should be good for another 5000 miles.

2746 2018-08-12 17:22:56 I don't know one person who fears brown skin. Half my family is Spanish and I once grew up in Venezuela 50 years ago when my father worked for Mobil Oil.  Now it's run by a socialist dictator who bankrupt a once rich country.

2748 2018-08-12 17:22:51 Yes article states oil picked up which led to a moderate improvement. Issue is global capital not coming to Canada due to excessive and uncompetitive tax and regulatory environment as the Chamber points out. More risk coming due to trade issues as we continue to underperform
2749 2018-08-12 17:22:39 จิงง,่ะ
2750 2018-08-12 17:22:15 Definitely stop until you can apply oil/lubricant. You can damage the gears if they're too dry.
2751 2018-08-12 17:22:05 I cancelled my oil change. That would require me getting off the couch. Putting on some clothes. Moving. Nah.
2752 2018-08-12 17:21:54 By accepting money from Big Oil? The DNC doesn't know how or when to stop pissing their constituents of!
2753 2018-08-12 17:21:53 The smell of oil frying gotta be on the top of the list of bad smelling shit
2754 2018-08-12 17:21:44 Because the Saudis are moving away from oil? Lol. Such a desperate story this Telsa lbo thing..
2755 2018-08-12 17:21:05 whalesong, thick oil paint, road trips through the desert, the corrosiveness of anger, silence, the healing nature of the ocean, memories attached to places that no longer exist, nectarines, the body as being one with the mind, greenhouses, Venus flytraps

2759 2018-08-12 17:20:50 It's like they even don't know.  Teenager's and children are being shot daily and further hundreds of juveniles still being locked up. Where the fcuk is @amnesty and the dumb @UN still protecting oil in the allied nations? If Jesus returned today. He'd weep over Israel impunity.
2760 2018-08-12 17:20:50 Maybe these ones will have oil.

Also, wouldn't *we* be the illegal aliens in this case? We don't have proper documentation.
2761 2018-08-12 17:20:46 This was happening to me A LOT when I used coconut oil to remove my makeup. It isn’t as bad now but I use Antihistamine eyedrops regularly

2763 2018-08-12 17:20:44 Her: talk dirty to me 

Me: crude oil isn’t as harmful as coal but still produces high levels of co2, releases toxins in the air and can cause great environmental damage resulting in the loss of entire ecosystems

Then bfr handing them to d police,we have to disgrace them publicly, thats only when they'll come back to their senses.
2769 2018-08-12 17:19:57 Also, politicians regularly criticize banking, oil and gas, insurance, pharmaceuticals, technology, airlines, lawyers, education, police, gun manufacturing, pro sports, etc. Why should journalism be off limits... especially when it's so often unprofessional and lacking lacking?
2770 2018-08-12 17:19:41 Neem oil is a good natural way to deter pests. It is also benficial for the plant.
2771 2018-08-12 17:19:37 That's because you're German. 

Yes, the same Germans who cry, whine and shiver in their boots about Russia WHILE PURCHASING 85% OF YOUR NATURAL GAS AND OIL FROM THEM.

2781 2018-08-12 17:18:19 Block them back. They are stalking. Probably trying to create more spin and dissent with the people who just follow the media along. Research everything ppl!! Don’t blindly follow, that’s what the swamp controls!!!
2782 2018-08-12 17:18:06 Seeing as today is #WorldElephantDay, it seems fitting to share some facts about #palmoil which I learnt recently.  In indonesia, the Semantran elephant is down to a count of ~2500, making it an endangered species  Why? Palm oil  (THREAD )

2785 2018-08-12 17:17:45 In Dec of 2016, Russia announced it had sold a stake in oil giant Rosneft for 10.5 billion euros ($11.3 billion). Carter Page arrived in Russia just before the sale was final. If we could find out who the actual buyers were, aside from Qatar, we might figure a few things out.
2786 2018-08-12 17:17:00 Saudi Arabia is one of those countries that even the U.S. is afraid to antagonize. They're stewards of Mecca, Muhammad was born there, and they sit on an ocean of oil. This is the last country you want to make an enemy.

2795 2018-08-12 17:14:53 Think I need the duplicate buhari anointing oil that's to be extremely love by people.
2796 2018-08-12 17:14:50 The season is a few days old and I am already fed up with the Citeh are brilliant, Pep is a genius etc malarkey. They have a bottomless well of oil money but this is Arsenal FFS.  About time the players realise who they are playing for and stand up and be counted.  #afc
2797 2018-08-12 17:14:49 Take carrots from oven, pour hot oil onto hand. Ouch!

Take casserole dish from oven, remove lid with bare hand. Ouch!

That's both hands burnt this dinner time and the kids didn't even eat the bloody thing.

2804 2018-08-12 17:14:16 @subaru_usa why are all your service centers closed on Sunday? Really?
Ya know, some of us work during the week and the weekends are when we get things like oil changes done. 
So maybe let’s move into the 21st Century.
2805 2018-08-12 17:14:13 If you’re serious about standing up to Riyadh, how come you are stilling giving their oil a free pass? How come you have exempted it from your upcoming carbon tax and are not subjecting Saudi oil to the same environmental regulations you have imposed on Western Canadian oil?
2806 2018-08-12 17:14:03 Indonesia did have oil exports those days, though.
But yes, the broader point is understood.

2809 2018-08-12 17:13:37 Oil prices are another factor which could dampen Canada’s outlook.Canada was the fourth largest exporter of crude oil  with a total value worth $54 billn .Fluctuations in oil prices, threat to economy. The price of crude is steadily increasing,but this may not be sustained..
2810 2018-08-12 17:13:36 I just realised that I have a lot of sketchbooks, a lot of pencils/pens (both b&w and colour), and some oil paints in my room. Ah yes, the life of an ex-art student

And you are worried about 15 billion, who told you to invest in the first place?

2821 2018-08-12 17:12:37 What are we going to do on cam today, friends? Maybe an oil show? Combined with a cumshow? 
2822 2018-08-12 17:12:32 What does oil money have to do with anything he said?

2854 2018-08-12 17:08:03 Don’t fret plastic/oil lovers! Global warming (the human kind) will increase sea levels and provide more space for the plastic islands and styrofoam turtles.

2860 2018-08-12 17:07:12 Also don't forget that Venezuela had larger oil reserves than Norway. If it had just taken any sensible centre ground policy or would be a very wealthy country now. The waste is on a truly staggering scale.

2881 2018-08-12 17:05:10 First, the house isn't energy efficient, they admit that. There's nothing revolutionary about solar panels, they just have too many. There's an oil boiler in the house. On a cloudy day or at night, you'd need to import electricity to even boil a kettle. 5 year playback is untrue.
2882 2018-08-12 17:05:04 Lost the race to what??

To coal, oil, and gas?  Sure.

To wind and solar??  Not even close.  Nuclear at least shows up on global scale, wind and particularly solar, barely register.

No real public resistance?!?  Really??
2883 2018-08-12 17:05:01 Why do businesses understaff during busy hours? In the past few weeks I've had several encounters with only 1 or 2 employees staffing crowded businesses with HUGE wait times (1 to 2 hours) - barber, restaurants, oil change.

2890 2018-08-12 17:04:28 Tolerating any ownership group requires some cognitive dissonance, but at least Liverpool isn't run by a Russian oligarch (Chelsea) or oil money (Man City).
2891 2018-08-12 17:04:23 This morning I woke up & rolled over & all I could smell was rumpies. My first thought was to tell christian “babe I’m sweating rumpleminze & I hate myself” He laughed hard af then told me I wasn’t sweating rumpies but last night I broke my peppermint essential oil & im drunk 
2892 2018-08-12 17:04:13 There's a lot of old people and a whole lot of snake oil that needs to find someone to buy it.

2899 2018-08-12 17:02:54 Can't wait until the global oil market collapses and American suburban sprawl becomes an uninhabitable wasteland and Man City wind up in administration
2900 2018-08-12 17:02:53 Max for sure. He will troll other countries easily out of big amounts off oil, while Mr. Libtard Pewdiepie will have a really weak 9 yr old army to STEAL oil.

2906 2018-08-12 17:02:08 Please don't try to remove it yourself. You might push it back, it might cause you pain and a smell. Go to the doctor, pour ear oil(2 drops) or just let it come out on its own. #mother with a 4 year old with an #earinfection

2916 2018-08-12 17:00:54 Omega-3 fatty acids can help keep your dog’s coat in good condition, and flaxseed oil and fish oil are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Dogs that scratch themselves frequently or bathe too often can lose oil from their skin, resulting in a less shiny coat.

2927 2018-08-12 17:00:10 They wouldn't be talking about oil any longer for one but apart from that surely none at all. I was talking about that to two Greek men from London today (in Amsterdam) regarding weather. They had no idea Scotland's weather was sometimes dramatically different from London's.

2942 2018-08-12 16:57:41 Fox news is just a network geared towards  making excuses for all of Trumps stupid and racist actions, and selling snake oil products to old people.
2943 2018-08-12 16:57:36 My mom literally pours so much oil in my hair and my hair absorbs the oil and becomes dry again!! LIKE WHAT THE FUCK!? Its a monster mane
2944 2018-08-12 16:57:26 Hi i just tried this and i think i waznt patient enough and took them off the pan early but question dd u use oil and should it be a lot water or just a little
2945 2018-08-12 16:57:26 Yes, it’s a thang.  Fortunately, Toronto, being multicultural, has lots of great places. 

I have several great Thai places within walking distance. 

Healthy? Well, I normally don’t eat that much oil.  But it could be worth it.
2946 2018-08-12 16:57:23 The recovery of oil prices in the early 2000s gave Venezuela oil funds not seen since the 1980
2947 2018-08-12 16:57:20 Bald fraud winning with oil money
2948 2018-08-12 16:57:11 I used Vaseline to brush them the way I wanted hair growth and then put castor oil on them every night :-)
2949 2018-08-12 16:56:49 The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis. Inflation peaked at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rose to 66% in 1995[17] as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak

2961 2018-08-12 16:55:32 Oil was discovered in the early 20th century and, today, Venezuela has the world's largest known oil reserves and has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil. Previously the country was an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa

2963 2018-08-12 16:55:26 #Kashmir is a done deal avor.of #india.

1.China won't support b'coz of Tibet & Xingjiang.
2. Saudi & Iran won't support, b'coz of economic considerations (oil)
3. OIC won't support b'coz India is home to 200 million muslims.

So #Pakistan is fighting a loosing battle.

2967 2018-08-12 16:55:13 He said "Research showed cannabis oil cures cancer to arthritis research, and they didn't care because it wouldn't make them money..." (bc.. arthritis=cancer?)

He didn't like that I disagreed with him and told him that doctors *do* want to cure things like cancer and arthritis.

3000 2018-08-12 16:52:23 the r/skincareaddition subreddit is a great place to find skincare information for all skin types, but personally I started off using the site Soko glam, I ordered the oil skincare set from them and it helped my skin massively. It’s a long routine, but it’s very thorough.

3003 2018-08-12 16:52:03 Plus no one knows what will be Iran's response. If they start to be belligerant to other countries then the geopolitics will drive oil even higher. So far no one blieleves they will do anything.

3005 2018-08-12 16:51:51 Kuza’s Jamaican Black Castor Oil Repair Cream leave in conditioner is actually better than Shea Moisture’s JBCO leave in and about half the price
3006 2018-08-12 16:51:40 For washing :Organics shampoo + Garnier conditioner. But I think the conditioner by organics could work best.

Moisturuzing : I use African pride olive moral products (moisturizer + oil)

To keep my hair from shrinking I just misturize and twist the night before ..
3007 2018-08-12 16:51:39 Well these tweets look a little funny now that Kaitlyn has deleted hers but I guess today isn't the day I hear a good argument for how oil pipelines are going to save us from global warming.

3011 2018-08-12 16:51:10 ねれんの……？
3012 2018-08-12 16:50:51 Yes, it's Oil Money!
3013 2018-08-12 16:50:50 "A 2017 study by researchers at Stockholm Environment Institute published in the journal Nature Energy estimated that nearly half of U.S. oil production would be unprofitable without subsidies.[29]" Imagine gas prices without those subsidies.
3014 2018-08-12 16:50:46 Kinda amusing how my first 200 game in bowling was with a plastic ball, light and short oil back then. #early90s #bowling
3015 2018-08-12 16:50:39 You gotta use premium bread. And make your egg mix with double cream. And you wanna have ALOT of oil in a really hot pan. Almost like deep frying. So bad, but so good

3020 2018-08-12 16:50:09 Ruble seems to be next pair to be blown up just after USDTRY... One more time 2014 repeat... Strong dollar -> low oil prices -> double digit inflation. Good luck anyway... End cycle will hit Russia very soon.

3022 2018-08-12 16:49:54 That goes well with Siluanov saying they might ditch Dollar in oil trade because it is too risky and the report about Russia easing Visas regime for Turkey. Integration all around Eurasia Asia and Turkey is the big prize to win.Devastating fo US. Erdo openly accusing US of coup.
3023 2018-08-12 16:49:33 Hahahahahahahaha! Oil Well
3024 2018-08-12 16:49:29 His assertion that our US Troops are all overseas to protect oil prices is also wrong.

3027 2018-08-12 16:49:11 I mean, I won’t feel bad if we demand a huge chunk of their profits as part of a social wealth fund like they have in Norway for their oil. The amount of tariffs, subsidies, & bailouts alone would justify that
3028 2018-08-12 16:49:04 Canada is an oil producing nation that is next door to another oil producing nation.  What is the risk?  What you call crap is what major countries will run on in 100 years.  Saudi Arabia will collapse back into irrelevance in the coming century.

3031 2018-08-12 16:48:49 How was the squirrel oil?
3032 2018-08-12 16:48:23 Just add our oil and you’ll be fine:)

この季節、ただでさえ体調壊しやすいんで気をつけましょうね

3038 2018-08-12 16:47:45 Arabian oil money will be hard to stop again this season. Arsenal are still shite
3039 2018-08-12 16:47:45 Like Eucalyptus is just about the worst tree to plant in dry areas prone to wildfires... the oil makes them *insanely* flammable w/a high flame temperature at that.
3040 2018-08-12 16:47:42 I don't disagree with other possible motives/facts but it's this 'Mid East' oil narrative I've heard since Faisal was king in Saudi Arabia makes me nuts. We don't need their oil. Just my .02 cents.
3041 2018-08-12 16:47:41 India will also not risk a major issue with the US over Iran. And remember that the sanctions will any company breaking the oil embargo. This means that shipping companies, shipping insurers, refineries etc will face a major backlash and frozen out of the USD payment system.
3042 2018-08-12 16:47:27 Why none of these damn bodegas got olive oil
3043 2018-08-12 16:47:27 Cleanse your face then put apple cider vinegar on it (JUST A TINY BIT, enough to spread all over the burn) and then put coconut oil on top of it. If you can repeat these steps every time you was your face, but at least do this over night.
3044 2018-08-12 16:47:17 Miftah says that Energy is prime minster SK Abbasi's forte! But they simply moved it from one imported fuel (furnace oil) to another (LNG) + coal (again imported) instead of solar or wind! 

Didn't do any reforms (tariffs/bidding process) or structural fixes (T&D infrastructure)

3049 2018-08-12 16:46:51 For £35M you expect someone who can: run, tackle, not dither on the ball, turn around quicker than an oil tanker
3050 2018-08-12 16:46:50 Thanks. I suspect that prices will continue to move sideways for a while  until more data/sentiment cause move up or down. Problem is that there is plenty of oil short term & impending shortage medium term.
3051 2018-08-12 16:46:44 I am on a new diet as from September, gaining 7kg in two and a half month in Cameroon is awful...don’t blame me, all great meals here are made using palm kernel oil!

Where’s my fitness trainer at?

3055 2018-08-12 16:46:19 The thing is, now, jb weld is off the table. Nobodies allowed to do anything with jb weld. Or brake pads. Or exhaust. Or fuel. Or oil. Or tires.
3056 2018-08-12 16:46:18 Have you tried quinoa? Also it cooks faster than brown rice I literally put like a tiny bit of the caldo de pollo consomé and a piece of garlic so it can have at least a little flavor lol and just toast it with a little olive oil.

3060 2018-08-12 16:45:42 Lmfaooo put some oil in it sis
3061 2018-08-12 16:45:34 Thanks man! Definitely going to tear it apart once Ben gets it out of the car. Very curious to see the inside of it after that. I’m guessing oil passageways blocked with crystallized suger. Probably clogged filter and pickup as well.
3062 2018-08-12 16:45:29 Back in December I checked photography forums and some people said a 1:1 mix of baby oil and water would do the trick. I bought some and never tried it until last night. I brought it up to the guy and he was game for it so we mixed and sprayed away. And it worked.
3063 2018-08-12 16:45:22 Agree, sick of the diversity smooze. I want jobs, rising wages, increasing home prices on the prairies and east coast. Environmentally responsible energy development, pipelines and tankers for oil, railway for shipping materials, ores, and grains.
3064 2018-08-12 16:45:12 I be treating myself so damn good, I just gave myself the best hot teatree oil massage in the shower I feel so relaxed.

3070 2018-08-12 16:44:52 You're a fool who voted for a snake oil salesman. Your gullibility is what he depends on.
3071 2018-08-12 16:44:50 いや気付いてなかったんで大丈夫っす。oilさんのツイートってあまりTLに流れてこないんで…

元々は悪くはないかななんて思ってたけど、そろそろ嫌気がさしてきて。
呟いたら話がめちゃくちゃ広がりました。
3072 2018-08-12 16:44:50 for sure...he's from Texas...definitely OIL...
3073 2018-08-12 16:44:46 I know if I had a little girl my skincare/beauty bill would double. It’d only be fair because of the way I used to play in my Momma’s fashion fair and oil of Olay 
3074 2018-08-12 16:44:45 @Rachael_Hodges try cannabis oil I know it may be illegal but everything is worth a shot! My heart goes out to you and your family 
3075 2018-08-12 16:44:28 Nope... Other small phone and oil companies were around, but PREVENTED from growing by the monopolies. Breaking monopolies up allowed small companies to compete and thrive. FB and TWTR "own the world" on their respective industries.
3076 2018-08-12 16:44:17 Bradley got an oil diffuser and let my fragrant nose work up his next blend. I’m about to be a perfumer y’all 
3077 2018-08-12 16:44:14 Democracy in action might sometimes feel like it is ineffective, but this is how community voices have been working to try to stop oil pipelines from impacting Native lands. It is a sidebar article in our August package of stories about environmental action.
3078 2018-08-12 16:44:14 I guess that is why Irving was so supportive in 2016 when Oil was the lowest?
3079 2018-08-12 16:44:13 Use an oatmeal face mask, if you have acne, sensitive, or oily skin. 
Oatmeal is great at soothing irritated skin and absorbing excess oil. Mix 5 tablespoons (25 grams) of finely-ground oatmeal with enough water or milk to make a paste. Spread the mixture over your  ( continue )
3080 2018-08-12 16:44:06 Do you think I could use veg oil instead of coconut oil ?

3082 2018-08-12 16:44:00 I’ve only used Jamaican Black castor oil for my hair, but she loves it.
3083 2018-08-12 16:43:58 It was pretty straightforward really, didn't need any special tools, great guide by @mbrmagazine on you tube, not exactly for my fork but was close enough, got the oil weight and measures of Fox website
3084 2018-08-12 16:43:56 Are Saudia fly free of cost, if not why they want to punish their airline, fortunately, I don't fly to that country, whose leaders suppress their people. I really feel very sorry for the people of  Saudi Arabia because despite lots of oil reserve their leaders are getting richer.
3085 2018-08-12 16:43:50 Yeah it helps being owned basically by an oil rich nation that could care less about turning a profit. But getting Guardiola was what put them over the top
3086 2018-08-12 16:43:35 There was a job put on during an on-call where a patient had brought over-the-counter CBD oil from home and the nurses wanted it prescribed. I didn’t deal with it, but in hindsight I guess it wouldn’t be legal to prescribe it.
3087 2018-08-12 16:43:30 Oh defo not just oil... install a Rothschild world bank, take down dictators, prevent nations having a gold backed currency, world domination, globalisation, invent a boogie man aka Osama or ISIS to keep people in fear, etc etc. Take your pick
3088 2018-08-12 16:43:29 The impact of outlandish snake oil claims of health, virility & stamina doesn't just fool the consumer of these products. It is a horrific million dollar industry that harms and kills our precious #wildlife #greed

3090 2018-08-12 16:43:18 . . . Someone needs to invent “Leave me the hell alone” oil. There would be no end to me using it.
3091 2018-08-12 16:43:12 Oh God... Do believe in Pizza gate too? How was the civil war on July 4th? I heard it was just you and Alex Jones alone on the 'battlefield' with nothing but tinfoil hats on, armed with snake oil... Hahahahaha! Y'all are FUNNY!!!

3093 2018-08-12 16:42:52 Nevermind im thinking ypu talking about a body oil or something 
3094 2018-08-12 16:42:38 Reading the nutritional content of chard, I feel almost virtuous putting another spoonful of chard pesto on my pasta. Disregard the parmesan and olive oil content, this is health food! 
3095 2018-08-12 16:42:27 Maybe but we put the Shah in for oil. We help overthrow a democratically elected government. How does that work?  And why are we responsible for a border dispute between two dictatorships? So we liberate Kuwait and return it to a dictator in the name of freedom? Ok WWJD?
3096 2018-08-12 16:42:21 1. In a microwave-safe mug (that can hold at least 8 oz of liquid), add flour, baking powder, sugar, milk, oil and vanilla. Mix with a small whisk until batter is completely smooth.
3097 2018-08-12 16:42:19 I have to switch up between three different deodorants. a different one every day. it's like the evolution in my armpit is moving fast. it also helps to blow dry the pits so the skin is dry, and put some coconut oil on at night so the skin heals
3098 2018-08-12 16:42:18 髄液漏ってパターンはなさそうですね。たぶん。
もちろん確定するには診てもらう必要がありますけども。
主な症状が鼻水だけっていうのであれば緊急性は低いと思いますよ。

3101 2018-08-12 16:41:53 Use tea tree oil/vitamin E oil and witch hazel !! On me it’ll change your life
3102 2018-08-12 16:41:53 It's all the excuse Britain needed to get out of the Iran deal. Britain still feels Iran's oil solely belongs to the UK.
3103 2018-08-12 16:41:52 Ingredients:
1/2 tbsp vegetable oil
1/8 tsp vanilla extract
1 1/2 tsp sprinkles
3104 2018-08-12 16:41:50 I’ve had the packs placed in and I’ve also got clove oil at home. Tastes disgusting but it does provide a lot of relief!
3105 2018-08-12 16:41:49 Elon Musk talks with Saudis to take Tesla private. I think the Saudis know very well when an oil pitt is empty but they will go through the motions just as with Trump talking billionsof dollRs in arms sales. Americans havent got the message yet the Saudis are broke.

3114 2018-08-12 16:40:39 Large businesses do this all the time, AB oil sands are a great example. As soon as prices star yes tanking projects were put on hold and or cancelled. Once prices start improving the start then up again. Businesses are out to make money. Lol

3126 2018-08-12 16:39:26 This is already more or less in the price. Brent is already trading the Oct contract and WTI will soon roll over to the Oct as the front month. And remember that Iranian sanctions will slowly take more oil off the market.

3131 2018-08-12 16:39:00 Because Saudi Arabia wants to reduce Candian Oil exports. Protecting their market share. Probably helping some protest groups too.
3132 2018-08-12 16:38:57 Yes it's all a conspiracy by the oil companies.

3138 2018-08-12 16:38:03 amazing what billions in oil money does for a club.
3139 2018-08-12 16:38:02 As far as I know, the Oil Companies associated w Irving weren't interested in AB bitumen bc they realized there was no future in dirty, less than top oil, & had no interest inputting in more money. They also get 1/3 of their oil via train I think.
3140 2018-08-12 16:37:43 Oh gosh, Gus. We have been subsidizing coal and oil for so much longer than any alternative energy source and for so much more. Our whole military strategy is set up to make sure we have enough energy resources. We certainly have allies based on only that interest.

3147 2018-08-12 16:36:39 That maybe the case someday. But for now the need for oil out weighs the demand for EV'S.  It will be some time down the road before the reverse is true.

3157 2018-08-12 16:35:44 This is an absurdly narrow minded view of the Saudi-US relationship. It dates back to the late '60s at least and has NOTHING to do with Trump. The entire US economy was/is propped up by Saudi oil & global trade in USD. Trump ain't the centre of the universe #Getoverit
3158 2018-08-12 16:35:40 use a wide tooth comb when your hair is wet to prevent breakage, after showers use a super small amount of keratin oil on your dry ends, trim your hair somewhat regularly to prevent major breakage shortening the length!!!

3162 2018-08-12 16:35:24 No it's not an oil. It's foam like iyabila endlebeni for 10s them ukhuphe iwax

3164 2018-08-12 16:35:19 It is certainly a measure of government performance. Modiji today fighting to save currency by selling bonds and reserves. Lucky that he had 310B$ reserves and low oil price. Just when oil is around 70$ government not able to handle CAD and reserves.
3165 2018-08-12 16:35:17 If you are a Saudi government targeting funerals and school buses, and committing war crimes against the poorest country in the region; Dont worry you still have oil. just say " OOPS, didn't mean it " and that's it. 

no no seriously that's it.

1) BUY JOHNSON BABY OIL & A FACE CLOTH
2) Wet that cloth
3) squeeze a little on to that wet cloth.
4) Rub it in.
5) Rub it all over! face, chest, feet, DICK everywhere
6) keep rubbing until you're satified.

He thinks Hussie's written a new ending that won't involve the retcon and THAT will be the epilogue.

3220 2018-08-12 16:30:54 GDP isn't a measurement of what a country can do, it's a measurement of total economic activity. If a pipeline bursts, the cost of the oil, the cleanup, and the repair all count towards GDP. When you look at actual resources, the US has food, houses, and medicine for everyone.

3227 2018-08-12 16:29:54 Do you mean less because Canadians should be investing in their own oil industry?

3229 2018-08-12 16:29:36 The idea that Canadian oil is "good" is a total fallacy and relies on ignoring the math on emissions! I expect scientists to care about the reality of climate change and the dangers of delayed decarbonization. You're just using debunked talking points.

3246 2018-08-12 16:27:13 How long do you think we have before we have to decarbonize and stop burning oil altogether? Do you really think that new oil infrastructure is a good investment given that we on track for 4.8C degrees of warming?

3264 2018-08-12 16:24:55 Reducing carbon emissions is a problem and building pipelines within Canada is a solution. It keeps environmentally friendly oil within Canada and avoids importing oil from third world nations. It eliminates the need for shipping vessels to transport oil across the ocean.

3275 2018-08-12 16:24:02 Don't agree.  I've never taken "global warming" to be a threat.  It is just one more manifestation of the world's constant change which will neccesitate adaptation, something humans are really good at.
Just like food shortages, peak oil, ozone layer depletion, HIV, etc, etc.

3296 2018-08-12 16:21:51 For it to be oil as in petroleum, it needs to be decomposed organic matter. Gas, (not oil) is found on Titan. As for the ability to extract energy from Titan, have you even contemplated the economics of extracting gas from Titan (forgetting the politics of it)?

3299 2018-08-12 16:21:28 多分力になれないと思いますけども…話を聞くだけ聞いて見たく…。
どうなさったのです？
3300 2018-08-12 16:21:24 We also have 20% of world’s freshwater resources. Canada can always use their own oil .  Also there are electric vehicles . No one will be riding bicycles.
3301 2018-08-12 16:21:21 We didn’t either. Too much light from the oil plant across the street. Maybe tonight we will see some lightning bugs.

3306 2018-08-12 16:20:50 SA is going to have a revolution, I feel sooner rather than later, the current state of affairs will definitely not be sustainable on investment or oil revenues, their internal productivity is dismal. I say rake the money now & hope for the best for that nation
3307 2018-08-12 16:20:45 Oh in the know lol sure cause all of the oil company CEOs are in Ottawa I forgot. Well then you better tell them that they arent making any progress. FYI it doesnt matter if its a 10b project or a 250mill project its the same basic order of work to build pipeline.
3308 2018-08-12 16:20:45 @VP Iran's oil should be completely cut off until November 4th, this vital force must be completely cut off; otherwise, Trump will lose a lot of things.
3309 2018-08-12 16:20:42 Once had an oppty going to Saudi for a project. Due to restriction on woman there which would cause unforeseeable inconvenience, a male colleague went instead. never had that issue in Canada. As for the other pointless points, let’s see what happens when oil runs out.

3315 2018-08-12 16:19:57 The oil is nationalized, so still socialist. But you're right that it's both socialist and capitalist; it's a mixed economy, like all other functional democratic nations in the world. Compromise is the solution, even if it leaves no one completely satisfied.

3336 2018-08-12 16:16:53 Another way of putting it is that globalization is run by oil cartel and price fixing while we'll never see a return on investment even by the China or India gamble. US $ tied to oil trade. Why can't anyone see the righting on the wall. Oil is over.

3399 2018-08-10 23:55:46 In all pizza seriousness, I would use only olive oil for sauce when cooking then drizzle or dip the ranch afterwards.
3400 2018-08-10 23:55:34 No, I said it was a major factor, not the only one. Learn to read.

And if you think Saudi Arabia hasn’t diversified its holdings beyond oil for a very long time now, then you’re even dumber than you look.

3415 2018-08-10 23:53:36 Yep. They get a oil swab through the barrel and a full outer wipe down with a small amount of oil on all metal parts.
3416 2018-08-10 23:53:08 We have sat back and accepted this Bullshit for far to long, the 3 main parties, Tory, Labour and Libdems all know the the U.K. is broke without our oil. The U.K. for to long has relied on investment from outside, allowed banks to still take on toxic business
3417 2018-08-10 23:53:03 Yeh. At first glance the "oil $ 2" reads the "oil two dollars".

3428 2018-08-10 23:51:12 Why are we backing #SaudiArabia? One of the most oppressive forms of #Islam which exports its bile across the world. Now we're complicit in bombing civilians in #Yemen, radicalising a new generation of #Muslim s against us. Time to stop whoring ourselves out for oil money.

3440 2018-08-10 23:49:21 I think I have an idea of how to make renewable energy replace oil

3442 2018-08-10 23:48:51 Someone: *has a problem* 
Me: “...have you tried lavender oil?”
3443 2018-08-10 23:48:45 Wendy says:  

I started CBD oil this past Saturday morning. It only took 48 hours for my hot flashes to be gone. Haven’t had one since....I take 5 drops of the 500 twice daily. 
3444 2018-08-10 23:48:44 I blame the Green Party. They have always sided with the oil industry & against workers / unions. That's why they chose "green" which is the color of money.

Remember when Nader tried getting seat belts removed from all cars at the request of the auto industry?

Darn commies.
3445 2018-08-10 23:48:40 You all can put out all the ads you want.  But we will turn out and we will volunteer our time every dime we can afford to elect you to stand up for what we VALUE as Democrats.  We care about the environment, healthcare, gun rights so stay out of bed with oil, NRA and Big pharma
3446 2018-08-10 23:48:36 The king probably explained that the natives had weapons of mass destruction and therefore Spain should control their oil... I mean gold. 
Any similarity to the present is just what empires are made of...
3447 2018-08-10 23:48:34 Same game: control of the oil fields. No better strategy than to give Israel nukes and then blame everyone else as the axis of evil.
3448 2018-08-10 23:48:30 My friend moved out to Montana to work as a pipe fitter in the oil rigsa few years back  he liked it for a while but eventually got worn out mostly bc of the job they worked his ass to the bone lol but I bet it’s preatty out there 
3449 2018-08-10 23:48:09 Late to this conversation but want to ask if the dry skin condition has improved? My lab had some dry patches around his leg joints a few months back. He’s 13 but still fairly active. I started applying coconut oil in his food & direct application to dry areas. Dry spots are gone
3450 2018-08-10 23:48:06 I was so hyped for eco gold only to find out it wasn’t it for me...but the olive oil I’ll keep a big bucket of.
3451 2018-08-10 23:47:58 Russia is reeling from Trump imposed massive sanctions Thier economy is in deep troubleCheap US gas& oil sales to EU nations can destroy it Now Putin is using military threats and ratchet up sub activity and fighter jets skirting US territory Won't work
3452 2018-08-10 23:47:21 This could be racist...

3455 2018-08-10 23:47:12 and then life hits you with bad luck: -needs new tires -oil change -registration -insurance
ugh, why?
3456 2018-08-10 23:47:04 There s/b equal opportunity for domestic oil producers. Either tax the Saudi oil or get rid of the tax on domestic oil. We in Canada believe in equal opportunity for all business  It is in @JustinTrudeau court to choose between the two evils. The choice is obvious.
3457 2018-08-10 23:46:52 Roll up your window and lock the door. Egads man!
3458 2018-08-10 23:46:46 I’ll donate endlessly if we get off dirty oil ! We have the stuff here and it isn’t going away yet we purchase dirty oil from barbaric countries while we produce and sell oil at a discount and continue to ship via rail ... Leadership now @JustinTrudeau
3459 2018-08-10 23:46:44 Do y’all think my nipples being hard through my T-shirt will get me a discount on my oil change?
3460 2018-08-10 23:46:43 We don't talk enough about how the meat industry is one of the biggest pollutants.. bigger than the wastes from oil
3461 2018-08-10 23:46:43 Try titanium jewelry if you don’t already have it and you can also use tea tree oil mixed with vitamin E oil for the irritation or infection. Cheeks normally never heal unfortunately.
3462 2018-08-10 23:46:30 Venezuela hi-jacked by the Castro’s of Cuba. A former bus driver ruining a country who had the richest oil reserves in the Southern Hemisphere.
3463 2018-08-10 23:46:17 Coconut oil is a blessing . Better hair, better teeth , better everything lol
3464 2018-08-10 23:45:59 I get that...there are exceptions. I had friends who grew up in small communities in eastern Oregon, whose economies had long since dried up...to succeed they needed to move to a medium sized town in the area. I know people who took jobs in North Dakota during the oil boom.
3465 2018-08-10 23:45:59 I live in an oil town. I’m unimpressed.
3466 2018-08-10 23:45:55 ma’am please stop drinking all the Kroger brand vegetable oil

3469 2018-08-10 23:45:31 If you take oil money I’m gonna move to a swing district and write in Susan Sarandon for everything
3470 2018-08-10 23:45:28 Lavender oil on the head and paws can help those fears... calms them down.

3480 2018-08-10 23:43:52 Going to try today. I have to get fresh oil though

3483 2018-08-10 23:43:33 @Lucas_Oil I see you don't care about customers reviews.  I'll buy another brand.
3484 2018-08-10 23:43:33 Politicians don't buy oil  The oil companies buy oil.  You have the ear of the oil companies so why don't you tell them to stop buying Saudi oil?
3485 2018-08-10 23:43:32 What’s the best coconut oil to use?
3486 2018-08-10 23:43:26 And we can win if we just whore ourselves out to bog oil? Really Tom?

3487 2018-08-10 23:43:26 Am I getting it right that Saudi Arabia previously bought 6b worth of goods and services from Canada and we bought 6b worth of oil? Only we will be doing the buying now? Ok.
3488 2018-08-10 23:43:23 Re-balancing FP,without extraordinary external factors like war etc,is a slow & steady process, like turning an oil tanker..
To date in post 1980s Pakistan, there was 'no effort' to consider a regional FP rather than an FP based primarily on Pak's US backed security paradigm

3491 2018-08-10 23:43:11 It depends on the car and the type of oil. Your manual probably has a recommended length for both regular and synthetic oil.
3492 2018-08-10 23:43:09 Real talk im gonna make him change *my oil* while i do a queer erasure of the odyssey w a dress on

3494 2018-08-10 23:43:00 Totally agree!!! Should ALWAYS unite! Hm if we take religion out of the middle east.... i think it would be the same TBH. Too much oil there for it to be about anything but $$$$$
3495 2018-08-10 23:41:51 biiiiitch  no tanning oil in the pool 
3496 2018-08-10 23:41:48 Hey dumba**...you still haven't made your point as to why Venezuela can't feed their own people. You say it's the oil. Ha! Why hasn't the oil effected the OPEC nations like Saudi? You are pushing a socialist agenda that will never survive in the USA... @Ocasio2018
3497 2018-08-10 23:41:35 Totally agree. No more oil from Saudi till Prince is out of office.

3502 2018-08-10 23:41:03 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
3503 2018-08-10 23:40:52 No.  The Dark Ages were the Dark Ages, brought on by the con artist/snake oil salesman, Robert Trent Jones.

Golf courses lost much of their whimsical nature when the late 40’s, 50’s, 60’s and 70’s hit. Gone we’re interesting routings, incredible green complexes and far more!
3504 2018-08-10 23:40:45 Also it seems the Termpol summary from Transmountain project website minimizes risks from increase in oil ship tankers on Burrard Inlet

3514 2018-08-10 23:39:23 hated investigative reporters looking for dirt on the "tar heel" state.  And yet nobody was better than the other person and still the Chevron Oil "guy" refused to return phone calls and yet he knew the black federal reserve guy from another "life".
3515 2018-08-10 23:39:17 DNC twitter botnet back online DNC Serves wikileaks a illegal summons and decides to go back on taking money from frackers and other big oil peoples ? geez thats all i have to say at this point they are heartless so is there bot nets...
3516 2018-08-10 23:39:16 looking at the images here you thought “effortless, garbage, disappointment, what has art been reduced to” and maybe that was the point, to me that makes sense. art isn’t always a magnificent oil painting done in the renaissance. it doesn’t have to invoke a positive reaction.
3517 2018-08-10 23:38:48 @TomPerez proposal for the DNC is a clear indication that he cares more about big oil money than he does about adapting to climate change - so much for #resisting.
3518 2018-08-10 23:38:33 CAN SOMONE PLEASE FIND ME SOME STIIZY CARTRIDGES. All I NEED IS THE PODS WITH THE OIL IN IT. thank you
3519 2018-08-10 23:38:26 Amazing how FEW Canadians actually know what kind of oil (bitumen) Canada is rich in and what it can/cannot be used for. Not all oil is the same.

3526 2018-08-10 23:37:53 I keep trying to wrap myself around cooking with garlic. From the paper, to the stickiness, to the smell, but damn... it really tastes good! Making baked tilapia with olive oil, garlic butter, white wine, onion and green pepper. Have a great week-end!
3527 2018-08-10 23:37:41 Basically what every conservative does. They don’t know that the reason Venezuela collapsed is because of dropping oil prices, not socialism
3528 2018-08-10 23:37:38 You mean the oil deals that trump nixxed in his first year?
3529 2018-08-10 23:37:38 Why do u want someone to rub oil on u ?
3530 2018-08-10 23:37:34 Wow.. where these orange people will import oil from, @JustinTrudeau and his government are picking a fight with Saudi Arabia, where @NDP WILL BUY oil from? Venezuela? Russia? Or USA? We will be happy to sale you oil. I truly feel for hardworking #Albertans..
3531 2018-08-10 23:37:28 So what?  We'll just shut off the flow of oil.  China can always use it.
3532 2018-08-10 23:37:11 Remember when they were pissed about lack of consultation with oil and gas ? Seems now there is to much
3533 2018-08-10 23:37:06 My mother just made chicken that was fried in butter and olive oil and it was really, really good

It probably isn’t healthy but fuck is it good
3534 2018-08-10 23:36:50 it be them fish oil pills
3535 2018-08-10 23:36:26 Also, being maybe the best ever at receiving critique during workshops. I say you roll up there with some oil and a filter and just stare at him until he hops to.
3536 2018-08-10 23:36:23 Check all your exterior door gaps, put new weather strip on any openings...even the smallest ones. Indoor mosquito traps work and so does Camphor Oil.  Worst case, drop the $ on an ultrasonic bug repeller.
3537 2018-08-10 23:36:18 Nah I really didn’t I got a oil ace treatment and my nigga was official
3538 2018-08-10 23:36:15 All you need to use is 40% vinager and a little vegatable oil so it sticks to the weeds same results  #RoundUpIsMurder and #Monsanto knew it.

3548 2018-08-10 23:35:05 what about little oil money, from working people?
3549 2018-08-10 23:34:59 A nativist economic decision on Norway's part. Their soverign wealth fund, which guarantees access to services, will not last forever as oil disappears. Less if the pop. grows rapidly.  As in the U.S. however, its true that migrant populatins contribute more than they consume.
3550 2018-08-10 23:34:35 This article is about the oil we import. How does this tweet relate to the article?
3551 2018-08-10 23:34:22 なるほど……

3554 2018-08-10 23:33:56 I hope they put oil wells all around your property.
3555 2018-08-10 23:33:29 No, not unless you want to be kidnapped and shaken down when they need a new oil rig.
3556 2018-08-10 23:33:27 New England is starved for natural gas. In winter power plants must shift from nat-gas (relatively  clean) to fuel oil (not clean) to reserve limited nat-gas capacity for home heating.
3557 2018-08-10 23:33:21 Nukes clean power? No  Coal, oil. Gas ...lots of CO2.  Solar and wind?
3558 2018-08-10 23:33:14 Indeed. Three years ago, I taught a Discipleship Training School and felt the Spirit call out women who believed they had been called to preach. 15 women came forward. I anointed them with oil and prayed for them. Since that day, 8 are now preaching. This is THE NEW DAY.

3576 2018-08-10 23:31:01 It just seems to be something you never grow out of.  Of course some people put it to good use, and they make careers out of it, and build bridges and cars and stuff. I just sat in the room furiously trying to get oil stains out the carpet.

3578 2018-08-10 23:30:47 Lejos de eso. El mercado esta priceando y lo viene haciendo hace rato, la vulnerabilidad economica del pais frente a un contexto externo adverso. Maiz, trigo, soybeanz en caida, oil en alza, dolar fuerte y alzas de tasas, ademas de lo poco claro de la economia del pais.
3579 2018-08-10 23:30:45 Tostones : cut green peeled plantains into 1 inch thick slices, then saute in just enough oil to cover a wide pan. Brown on both sides, then drain on paper towel.

3580 2018-08-10 23:30:31 @POTUS should step in and inform the Chinese that the tariff's will not only stay in effect on the oil as we will be charging a 100% export tax on oil to China. This would be to adjust for the unfair trade on their part.
3581 2018-08-10 23:30:13 That was expected. The cheap oil from IS dried up, now he is shown for what he is.

3589 2018-08-10 23:28:52 Venezuela doesn't have the base economy or historical maturity to make an experiment in socialism work effectively, especially patterned on Cuba's. Chavez was basically a good man but too politically naive to pull it off.
Covert U.S. right-wing meddling didn't help either.

3593 2018-08-10 23:28:26 In the short term we should halt Saudi imports and find oil elsewhere.  Long term pipeline is required asap!  It isn't wrong to say import from others....

3597 2018-08-10 23:27:39 You can't sell ice water to eskimos unless you include some fear factor.  He does it every time,  what are you afraid of? Only he alone can save you if you buy his snake oil.

3631 2018-08-10 23:21:51 We could shutter the entire country, remove all people & livestock, and the effect on global emissions would still be marginal. A rounding error.

3640 2018-08-10 23:20:35 ...fwiw, Edison and For made a low-priced electric car; Standard oil had their gas product to sell tho, and were a "great" monopoly to make others use it

3688 2018-08-10 23:14:40 Also puttin our oil woes at the feet of Harper is also wrong.

3723 2018-08-10 23:09:31 Al princpio confundi bloqueador con tanning oil, despues me valio, ahorita juro que me arrepiento
3724 2018-08-10 23:09:18 Yaaar i tried,, i am too childish and its very hard for me to  give up on sugar :( and to develop taste for stevia. My mother in law makes this coconut oil thing in the morning:)
3725 2018-08-10 23:09:11 The way gals follow men with cars around makes one wonder if they were breastfed with engine oil...lemme run b4 they slap me
3726 2018-08-10 23:09:02 "Aw, come on, you guys. We can take a little bad press over a few billion oil dollars, can't we?" ~T. Perez
"What do you mean, 'Bernie Sanders doesn't take oil money' ? Seriously???" ~also T. Perez

3728 2018-08-10 23:08:06 Amen! Oklahomans for Independent Living offers a monthly trip to the movies, but I'm not sure if you have to meet up at the HQ to be included, and I'm out on a rural road, so getting to OIL for activities is pretty difficult.
3729 2018-08-10 23:07:44 (kinda ooc) But speaking seriously, #URSAL would be a superpower. Imagine the economy that would arise from the GDPs of all countries. The massive oil reserves. World's largest armed forces. Any country that tries an embargo would be digging its own grave.

Give us a chance, @UN!

3732 2018-08-10 23:07:40 So anyway today my dealer took me to Starbucks and bought me some coffee to make up for not having any change on him when I went to buy some oil. Which seems a pretty good way to end the week.
3733 2018-08-10 23:07:26 That lip oil is one of my favourite products ever!! I used it religiously in Mexico!! 
3734 2018-08-10 23:07:22 Buset tea tree oil gue dikira kayu putih ama bapake, untung belom dipake
3735 2018-08-10 23:06:22 لا ي عم crude oil 
3736 2018-08-10 23:06:20 
3737 2018-08-10 23:06:10 It’s all in the plans, Johnny. I admit I’m focussed on rooting out gun violence in Toronto’s lower communities. But after that, we’ll be lowering the cost of tractor oil, etc, for my rural friends. Help is coming. #onpoli
3738 2018-08-10 23:06:01 1: All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis products, such as CBD oil, on board flights. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement if they discover these products while screening your property.

3740 2018-08-10 23:06:00 Totally agree it’s a movement. But it’s not Allah it’s about money. Without oil they would be still sitting around in tents in the desert and living medieval style. But they buy our government with the oil money starting with the elder Bush. Everyone thereafter can be bought.
3741 2018-08-10 23:05:57 Dude. Read this thread. The Oil person outted herself and said Trisha was calling a criminal too. No proof. Just mad cause trisha got some info dropped in her lap about this chick being a stripper but being all critical of Trisha. Quite a treat
3742 2018-08-10 23:05:41 Ya, I can’t figure it oil out either!
3743 2018-08-10 23:05:39 Also, just tanned with the @JamesReadtan coconut body oil and I smell amazing! Thank god for @jamie_genevieve and her A+ recommendation 
3744 2018-08-10 23:05:39 Or palm oil.
Our rulers share the same characteristics with "crude" oil
3745 2018-08-10 23:05:38 A wegmans sub, light mayo and oil on the side???? Man listen
3746 2018-08-10 23:05:24 Canada don't let them make you hostages for oil. Stand and tell them you are done with this nonsense.
3747 2018-08-10 23:05:13 @DNC Be open to the democratic choice, do away with BIG pharma, oil, health, Ins, Food, and ALL PAC and Lobbiest swaying. Let them suck their money from Mitchie McC. We can WIN overwhelmingly if we UNITE and STOP Money-Catering. Make it not about money, and impose Term Limits!!

3749 2018-08-10 23:04:57 Gotta go buy more chili oil at the store! We're all out....again. >_>"
3750 2018-08-10 23:04:29 Then since Canada has 13% of world proven reserves I want all of it to be included in that 1/3 and anyone worried about the environment and human rights should want Canadian  oil too.
3751 2018-08-10 23:04:18 anyone have any big weekend plans? tomorrow imma take @MrsNoonerSA car to dealership for oil change and then we are going to go to the beach! idk about after that. Sunday def farmers market but dont know if go out to Malibu or keep it local with Studio City, tough choice! TGIF (:

3755 2018-08-10 23:03:49 "Hemp seed is 30% oil, is more nutritious than soy bean, contains more essential fatty acids than any other source, is second only to soy beans in complete protein (but is more digestible by humans), is high in B-vitamins, and is 35% dietary fiber. Hemp seed does not contain THC"
3756 2018-08-10 23:03:39 The air fryer is great.....fast and no oil needed, love it...
3757 2018-08-10 23:03:39 Dont know or remember. When you talk Saudi Arabia it's always about oil first. Price and production volume. Influences everything else.
3758 2018-08-10 23:03:31 Avoid multiple hair treatments. Avoid applying heat to your hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. I really need to figure this out. Is it NISIM or NHB?  slows hair loss. or something? How can I discover the authoritative web page.
3759 2018-08-10 23:03:25 みんな揃ってる∑(ﾟДﾟ)
3760 2018-08-10 23:03:07 Lmao, so the universe found out I was going to change my motor oil for the first time ever by myself and decided to release rain
3761 2018-08-10 23:03:05 Proof that no matter what nonsense I spout, my next oil change is not how I was hoping that emoji would render.
3762 2018-08-10 23:02:55 holy shit the BO4 beta on Xbox One is super-cali-frag-alistic-ex-peal-atrocious; besides the terribad design decisions, it runs like an engine that hasn't had an oil change in 100K miles...sub 60fps & less than 30 during gunfights & textures that resemble a 1st grader's drawings
3763 2018-08-10 23:02:54 NARCOREGIMEN OBVIA CASO CITGO...EE.UU. le ha dado en el higado..PDVSA se le tranca el grifo..a quien le vendera ese volumen de OIL que le enviaba a CITGO ? Se pagaban y se daban el vuelto ..Se le acaban los US$ y el Petro murio..Ningun rojo tiene ordenes de hablar de CITGO !
3764 2018-08-10 23:02:38 Use palm oil
3765 2018-08-10 23:02:29 He prefers we import the oil, and export the responsibility for obtaining it.
3766 2018-08-10 23:02:25 A snake oil diversionary con game. Are our leaders so blind that they will allow this? The Bible says greed is the root of all evil. If one tries to learn from the Bible how can they allow this man to continue. Shame on all of you for selling the countries soul for your party.
3767 2018-08-10 23:02:06 But hey we are still buying their oil..SMH
3768 2018-08-10 23:02:01 Where tf did my $50 oil go
3769 2018-08-10 23:01:34 キャリアオイルの種類・ホホバオイル/ Jojoba oil
ツゲ科、種。皮脂バランス調整作用、保湿、セルライトや妊娠線を防ぐ。植物性の「ワックス」に分類されます。 10℃以下で固体になり、常温で液体に戻ります。浸透力は優れている。非常に酸化しにくい。使い心地はさらさらしていて軽い。

3779 2018-08-10 23:00:29 I loved @linklamont's lip balm when I first got it, but after finding out it was one of three two things that started a company, made me love it even more. (I would have asked for the beard oil but I don't have a beard, or know someone with a beard, that uses beard oil)
3780 2018-08-10 23:00:27 Yes, I believe so! If you're in the market for a new lotion, for an adult,  nivea has a new oil infused lotion,and omg that's the best lotion I never put on my body!
3781 2018-08-10 23:00:27 CDB oil apparently treats alopecia.. let’s hope.

3784 2018-08-10 23:00:09 I do vinegar with orange oil and/or dish soap. Works like a charm--I am winning a war with thistles on an acre plot. I will try your recipe. More folks need to know about this and leave the roundup at the store.

3790 2018-08-10 22:59:43 Once again, my clumsiness knows no bounds. Joe's back was hurting so I massaged the area with peppermint oil we have to act like Biofreeze and what's the first thing I do after...rub my eye. I swear, I have never felt such pain but my eye is all minty fresh now. #Clumsy
3791 2018-08-10 22:59:41 Maybe he was trying to strike oil? Poor guy.

3793 2018-08-10 22:58:54 The A5025 between Llanfachraeth and Llanfaethlu is now reopened following an RTC. Please take care, as some oil may remain on the road. #roadsafety #gosafe #NWP #YnysMon #Anglesey
3794 2018-08-10 22:58:47 seems to me the oil truck couldn't stop on time
3795 2018-08-10 22:58:41 UNITED STATES SPACE FORCE by 2020! It means other countries will have a new military division. Oil rich nations will have at least one space fighter jet. The U.S. Space Force needs a Space Force One to protect the American President. Space security ensures commercial ventures.
3796 2018-08-10 22:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3797 2018-08-10 22:58:27 I justed tried to make brownies but instead of using 2/3 of oil I did a cup and 2/3 . Ugh I didn't realize until after it baked and now I can't eat brownies  I can't believe I can't read a measuring cup
3798 2018-08-10 22:58:08 She was such a smug bitch back then making jokes about people being "old". She was no oil painting on her best day back then and now she looks like a man.

3802 2018-08-10 22:57:09 So yesterday I marinated chicken thighs in lemon and lime juice, raspberry vinaigrette, some herbs and spices, oil and vinegar, mustard, anchovies and honey (overkill, I know!) and then cooked them with garlic, capers, anchovies, and pickled lemons. It was...so good...
3803 2018-08-10 22:57:08 “if the warming trend continues in the 21st century, climate impact may outweigh [other] anthropogenic influence and become the primary factor in the extratropics” 
The feedback loop will move beyond what humans can influence. It will make "Peak Oil" drbble look like a fairytale
3804 2018-08-10 22:57:04 Freshen your breath fast by rubbing a tiny bit of doTERRA's Cassia essential oil on your tongue. It also helps to curb your appetite! :)
3805 2018-08-10 22:56:57 All the good! Right! Why can't anyone see all the good? American's are so better off now. All we need now is to put asbestos back in our products and homes, kill off all wildlife, drill up oil from every inch of ocean, and we're set! We're great again!
3806 2018-08-10 22:56:50 and both of canada and saudi arabia have oil ,so does saudi's oil much better then canda's oil
3807 2018-08-10 22:56:28 So much on my damn head I can’t even deal. Forgot to price oil change
3808 2018-08-10 22:56:26 But yeah oil based makeup removers are the best for waterproof makeup so I would have to give up wings with gel liner and hope my liquid lasts all day.
3809 2018-08-10 22:56:23 Have you any suggestions as to what Albertans #All Canadians need to do in order to change this back to our rightful control over OUR OIL & GAS INDUSTRY  ?
3810 2018-08-10 22:56:18 After nearly a decade of getting oil changes, I have finally mastered the art of Grease Monkey: $10 off coupon, bring your own bulbs for replacement, eat the free cookies in the lobby, smile pretty, and say no to everything 
3811 2018-08-10 22:56:13 Rub it in oil and cover it with plastic wrap.
3812 2018-08-10 22:56:13 Also I did just use the face oil trick on my foamy beer in this fancy place. I’m a classy broad

3814 2018-08-10 22:56:07 if you go dark Markus, have friggin corrosives or oil come out of his tear ducts as he starts moving into straight-up murdering the swat team, do some Mass Effect 2 renegade stuff
3815 2018-08-10 22:56:06 I'm in the @DrJasonJohnson camp. And now I hear that that the Dem party is thinking about taking money from the Oil/Gas industry again. SMH.
3816 2018-08-10 22:56:02 Just tryna figure out how it’s time for an oil change already I literally ain’t even had this car for a month yet moe
3817 2018-08-10 22:55:59 Это так прекрасно, что я заплакала. Арми так любят бантан. Они реально наши ангелы
3818 2018-08-10 22:55:42 Oil diffuser!
3819 2018-08-10 22:55:36 Well it originally was 1 usd = 50 syp, so thats an inflation of 1000% which is relatively good since we lost 80% of our land at one point and most oil and most agricultural land, also most products didnt reach that level of inflation like a snickers bar was 35 syp now its 150-200
3820 2018-08-10 22:55:17 Dang girls take care of your hair!!! Take a break from the heat and get a hot oil treatment!! You’ll miss it when you have to cut it all off trust me
3821 2018-08-10 22:55:15 Well it doesnt look like happening however what if Oil loses its place to solar/alternatives
3822 2018-08-10 22:54:59 for Christmas I just want a shit ton of essential oil blends

3824 2018-08-10 22:54:19 Thanks for the article...Horrible stuff.  I can’t get over the widespread use of chemical spray for mosquitos as well.   I see so much chemical use in my industry.  I just experimented last weekend with an essential oil mix alternative that worked great.
3825 2018-08-10 22:54:16 Milani has a good pore-filling primer and eyeshadow primer for pretty cheap! And I use the Urban Decay “oil slick” spray (or something along those lines) and although the price is pretty steep, it really does help w oil control! I even use it when I’m not wearing makeup
3826 2018-08-10 22:54:08 Kaepernick quietly took a knee in protest as is his right. it wasn’t until our sophomoric president started screaming lies  from his bully pulpit to arouse his deplorable base. Clearly they love it. But all that snake oil peddling doesn’t change the facts.
3827 2018-08-10 22:54:03 @mrlube just wondered why I was told that they couldn't change my oil with the oil I brought in. Brand new oil in sealed jug. Told some bullshit babble about warranty and customers blaming them etc.... sounds like they only want to sell overpriced oil. Never going there again
3828 2018-08-10 22:54:03 --order for the Zaibatsu to cease control of her father's oil fields shortly after he became the CEO. This only resulted in him going silent for a few moments. "...I see."

Glad these my real nails cause half are broken. #nails #mani #pedi
3833 2018-08-10 22:52:43 ALL western nations should turn their backs on Saudi Arabia, until they learn that girls and women are humans of equal importance (more important, actually), and children shouldn't be bombed.
Let's see SA try to grow their own wheat.
We don't need their oil, or their ignorance.

3837 2018-08-10 22:51:55 Sure. It had nothing to do  with actually caring more about the native locals than the oil companies that fund the corporate Dems campaigns.
3838 2018-08-10 22:51:33 Continuing to take pay outs from big oil amidst global warming is extremist? Really?

3841 2018-08-10 22:51:03 Somewhat miss leading. Coal still big player in Gernany, many do not have oil/coal so to be less dependent must choose one. Solar has big fossil fuel impact during manufacturing and waste disposal.

3853 2018-08-10 22:48:57 I usually wash my hair with head and shoulders and leave it on for a while and that fades it quite a bit or I’ll use a colour stripper and then condition it loads and put coconut oil on so it’s not dry and damaged
3854 2018-08-10 22:48:45 白Tティーチがやけにかっこよく見えるの、多分すごい「清潔感」が漂ってるからだと思うんだよな………思わず黒髭じゃなくてティーチって言っちゃうぐらいには………
あれですよね、コミケの前にはちゃんとお風呂に入るタイプですねあなた
3855 2018-08-10 22:48:41 I listened to half of this today, so good! Loved when she said we’ve gone from feeding plants soil, to oil, w nitrogen fertilizer. And how 95% of vegans fail w/in 3 months due to health issues. Needs to be circulated! Great podcast.
3856 2018-08-10 22:48:40 Get you a dad like mine, he's so worried about my hair falling out he said the first thing he's going to do tomorrow morning is buy mustard oil for me 
3857 2018-08-10 22:48:35 #FBF to the time I called in to The Splendid Table to ask about grape seed oil

3863 2018-08-10 22:47:38 I’m clearly going through menopause there should be no reason I’m this hot looking like someone through oil on my face
3864 2018-08-10 22:47:30 I just started listening to today’s Pre Game and @rodimusprime and @RhymeOverReason shouted out my oil! I’m cheesing SO HARD right now  #TBGWT
3865 2018-08-10 22:47:15 its all smoke and mirrors liberals were going to call a election in November but no one backed Trudeau in the g7 community lol he looks like he is a complete yellow dog still kissing ass buying up Saudi oil he will never win even with all the parasites and eastern union scum
3866 2018-08-10 22:47:00 1. He hasn't scammed anyone
2. He has never peddled snake oil 
3. He has worked a real job. That real job is Youtube. If you truly don't believe youtube is a "real job" you're a dumbass.
4. None of this is justification for banning his account for a mere joke.

3881 2018-08-10 22:44:34 present an economic opportunity with good faith negotiations. Pay attention: OBOR means transportation for the entire Asian continent, those trucks and trains need fuel to deliver goods, fuel which can come from Syria. Even the Israelis were negotiating with Russia for oil deals.
3882 2018-08-10 22:44:32 Last week all the grass here at the track was dead and brown. Two days ago, this was Lake Corrigan Oil Speedway. 3.3 inches of rain fell in an hour, and flooded the infield.
3883 2018-08-10 22:44:24 "every precious oil" is some turn of phrase
3884 2018-08-10 22:44:21 Not really cooking but you can throw it in some olive oil and in a week or so you’ll have basil-infused olive oil which is delicious on just about anything
3885 2018-08-10 22:44:19 I'm oily af and I love the Winkylux Whipped Cream primer or the Smashbox oil control primer. Setting spray I've had good results with KVDs or Cover FX matte spray 
3886 2018-08-10 22:44:17 @realDonaldTrump To the  President, it would be nice if you had Sarah Palin in your Oil and Fracking cabinet. She’s well versed in it and you’ll need someone who’s knowledgeable of the Alaskan terrains as well. Just saying
3887 2018-08-10 22:44:16 Very good point. They could, however, blend oil sands bitumen with a much smaller volume of Texas/Saudi cried than they currently purchase
3888 2018-08-10 22:44:13 If you slice them thinly and fry them in a little bit of oil and salt you get something that is crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

3891 2018-08-10 22:44:00 Why not use some pure virgin olive oil for thos face locks like the Craawww? @C0achCrawford
3892 2018-08-10 22:43:55 Baked in the over with some garlic salt and sprinkled with olive oil. G shit
3893 2018-08-10 22:43:52 I’d love the chance! There is no denying the pen had been mismanaged all season and that’s why one of the best pens in the game in now leaking oil.

3895 2018-08-10 22:43:43 The Corp Dems are Republicans. They want to be just like them- from fracking to Big Oil and all- that’s why they run to them into the center with their hands out looking for cash.
3896 2018-08-10 22:43:16 よちよち
3897 2018-08-10 22:43:13 @RickAnderson .... they jilted emphatically want them to play 'nice' (U reap what U sow) remember 'let the eastern BASTARDS freeze to death'--an AB response) result we have to import 56% of our oil use. AB a real CANADIAN so before U spout off get the FACTS from history
3898 2018-08-10 22:43:06 Hey Eastern Canada.. you don’t have to buy your oil from Saudi Arabia, Alberta has the 2nd largest oil deposits in the world and I’m sure you could buy it all in CDN currency PLUS you get some of that money spent as a transfer payment.

So.. umm...

WIN/WIN? #EnergyEast
3899 2018-08-10 22:42:46 People need to pull their heads out of the sand and recognize that this is real. I cannot figure out the thought process going on in their heads. Here so much of it comes from our addiction to oil. Things have to change but too many are making $$ off of the ruination of the world
3900 2018-08-10 22:42:43 Afraid to break it to you...you’ve been on your knees since birth sucking away as the Monsanto’s and BP Oil’s have been sticking it in your mouth.  You have Free Speech, but with consequences.  You have the right to bear arms, only to be told where you can carry them.
3901 2018-08-10 22:42:11 May be some overlap.
3902 2018-08-10 22:42:06 A large portion of isis funding was from oil. Erdogan was doing business with them all along.
3903 2018-08-10 22:41:36 We hardly buy any oil from Saudi Arabia, and they’ve announced that they’ll still sell if we buy. My point is that Singh doesn’t need to be talking about this at all.  It’s a case of making a stupid point when no point needs to be made at all. Red herring time.
3904 2018-08-10 22:41:34 @AsmPatODonnell will you support 2500 foot set backs for your constituents? Lots of active oil wells in the L.A. Harbor area, Signal Hill and Long Beach. This is a matter of public health.
3905 2018-08-10 22:41:32 Nice holster.
3906 2018-08-10 22:41:20 Took @lil_trinaaa with me to get an oil change. Y’all I didn’t know anything. Good thing she came with me lol
3907 2018-08-10 22:41:08 Company A is selling "racing engine oil coolers". In the item description it states that they should be used for highly modified and hardly driven and minimal track use. WTF!!
3908 2018-08-10 22:41:00 The only thing that keeps the world from attacking Saudi Arabia is that they're sitting on so much oil. Something needs to be done to stop these barbarians.

3914 2018-08-10 22:40:20 I wonder if the SJW crew will show up at Irving oil to protest Saudi crude. Lots of Alberta oil that could replace it except for that Trudeau idiot canceling energy east pipeline.
3915 2018-08-10 22:40:20 Get real facts. Stop publishing snake oil bullshit.

3919 2018-08-10 22:39:56 The oil takes a couple hours to kick in the night time dry my eyes cross in 5 minutes I’ll be chatting away then lose all concentration so it does take my mind off it 4a few minutes
3920 2018-08-10 22:39:55 Maybe her liberal sidekicks in Montreal who are dumping raw sewage into the river could use her advise and assistance (especially around election time!!!!)? After all she is a subject matter expert on things like "dirty Alberta Oil" and how to save the environment...... NOT!
3921 2018-08-10 22:39:54 @RickAnderson U dont need an expert to know AB seeded the oil cacophony some 40 yrs ago when they insisted OIL OURS KEEP UR HANDS off AB had no intention of sharing oil (dealing with US now self sufficient & exporting AB is in trouble & is whining about Canadians  (PQ BC) .....
3922 2018-08-10 22:39:52 Thank you for taking down the morale compass of the Republican Party. When Americans start realizing you are a snake oil salesman and only enriching the elite the Republican Party will have a deep hole to dig out from.
3923 2018-08-10 22:39:31 Do you want me to get my cock ring on and oil out and watch you get fucked love to cum as I watch you Sexy xx 
3924 2018-08-10 22:39:13 No please oil is "anwa" not "angua"
3925 2018-08-10 22:39:06 So, does this mean that the space force will go after space oil??? #burn #roasted #politics
3926 2018-08-10 22:38:55 Yes I was referring to a group of countries. I know Sweden and Finland don't have oil (actually because of some stupid political systems), but they do possess other qualities I mentioned. I was making a generalization due to limited character space.
3927 2018-08-10 22:38:52 Just like us above the 49th they will pull the Saudi kids out of your schools, cut off their air flights, oil and the list goes on.
3928 2018-08-10 22:38:49 Sunflower seed oil is more expensive than gasoline. But it’s enviro-friendly I guess

3930 2018-08-10 22:38:46 I usually cut the peppers into quarters. Would soak them in olive oil and some salt and pepper. They should come out really good
3931 2018-08-10 22:38:34 cute date idea: you take my car to change the oil while i play minecraft
3932 2018-08-10 22:38:06 Saudi Arabia has gotten away with so much due to being wealthy and sitting on an ocean of oil. Well F them.  Majority of the 911 bombers. No problem. Embargo Qatar, mistreat women, enslave foreign workers, bomb innocents in Yemen all
3933 2018-08-10 22:38:06 Under NAFTA they're screwing Canada also eg., Timber, oil from Alberta, electricity & power from Québec. Imposing unnecessary tariffs & excise duty on various other finished goods. At the border they ask us do you haveoranges &citrus? You say yes, they take it & throwaway

3937 2018-08-10 22:37:52 We are actually net exporters of oil, with the capacity to be entirely self-sufficient of all imports. So that's a pretty empty threat.
3938 2018-08-10 22:37:51 In that sense the LDN (watch the video) and CBD oil along with Yoga, breathing, meditation will help to reset your body.
Did you have any trauma before this incident i.e.psychological?
3939 2018-08-10 22:37:51 Canada could easily be oil sustaining on its own

3943 2018-08-10 22:37:29 @pizzahut Ordered a cheesy bite pizza and a dozen mild wings from your Palm Harbor FL store tonight. The pizza was pretty decent, but the wings came in a pool of oil, and taste like cleaning fluid!  What happened to your original wings?! #BringBackOriginalPizzaHutWings
3944 2018-08-10 22:37:23 The best part of Adobo is that the day after you can fry that shit right in its own oil and have a crispier and toasted version that is arguably better than Adobo itself.

3945 2018-08-10 22:36:57 There must be a moral oil company. I know that Shell Oil at least acknowledges the cause of climate change. Are there any others?

3949 2018-08-10 22:36:29 @fridayFrustration When a recipe says "Heat the oil in a medium saute pan over high heat until almost smoking" - how do I know when it is about to smoke? You can't. It has to smoke, then you say "oh, that was it 30 seconds ago"
3950 2018-08-10 22:36:24 I would like an Independent Scotland. I believe Scotland would be more financially stable than rUK in a short period. We have many notable commodities eg food and drink, energy,  oil, fish, expertise in many areas. Making weapons and war is a bad idea.

3952 2018-08-10 22:36:11 Our sales rep told me some people think our prices are too good to be true! They see our nice packaging and low pricing and they are like 

Our prices are low because we are the manufacturers of our own CBD oil goods! We cut out the middlemen 
3953 2018-08-10 22:35:59 I swear, I eat one mildly greasy food item and all the oil in it somehow migrates from my stomach to a single pore on my chin.
3954 2018-08-10 22:35:45 It probably contains a paper trail showing payments to payoff Tatych and Janda dept, and payments for the house in 2007. You know the h oil use that is 50 meters from where the RAV was spotted 3 or 4 times.
3955 2018-08-10 22:35:36 Also I was 30,000 miles over when I was supposed to get my oil changed 
3956 2018-08-10 22:35:32 A day later still upset that my car spent 5 hours at the dealership for a simple pre-booked oil change. #millsmotors #quickoilchange#dissappointed

3962 2018-08-10 22:34:28 Tigers don't have moral agency like we do. Much of the meat you like, you likely enjoy because of the oil and seasoning you cook it in- which is made from plants- unless you eat meat unseasoned and either raw or cooked in water?
3963 2018-08-10 22:34:23 The first weekend in September. I have to get my hair did and an oil change. That’ll be great!
3964 2018-08-10 22:34:14 In front of my house have one gas station and they put and pin they location on my house and I see some people clam that business by PayPal after i going etoro but I feel that one will have problem because some part of people make air pollution that make me remove oil factory.
3965 2018-08-10 22:33:53 There should be consumption taxes on public resources. Drill for oil? You have to pay into a public resource. Cut down trees? Same thing. Pump water from a well? Tax there too. Not enough to seriously punish individual use, but enough to make companies think twice.
3966 2018-08-10 22:33:39 guess WHOMST realized that she bought the wrong styling cream and the one she'd been using was full of COCONUT OIL and is no longer spiralling about why her hair suddenly and inexplicably looks like greasy trash

3976 2018-08-10 22:32:36 The  curse Nigerians have to endure because of the oil wealth is ridiculous.  Most unfortunate the basest elements in Society have risen to power.  They had made their stamp of illiteracy and personal aggrandizement the  norm. Where can Nigeria find a political Messiah?------

3986 2018-08-10 22:31:32 You're full of shit. You're a mouthpiece for Big Oil right when California is burning. They lied about climate change for decades. Now it's questionable whether we can change things before the point of no return for the tipping points. You got a lot of nerve.
3987 2018-08-10 22:31:02 Have any of y’all heard of an air fryer? My girl just snapped me her using an air fryer to make wings.. and it looks legit. FRYING THINGS WITHOUT OIL. HOW?!
3988 2018-08-10 22:30:46 Easy peasy cheesy! 
Homemade cheese thank you very much. One more day to let the whey drain out then add olive oil sea salt and herbs to it tomorrow very similar to a extra creamy goat cheese.
3989 2018-08-10 22:30:36 Make sure you have the right oil. No pure cbd it's made from industrial hemp and doesn't work. Don't smoke bud it's harsh. I used to but I'm vaping a high thc co2 extract oil.

4004 2018-08-10 22:28:24 I hate to see any of my girls in pain. I've been vaping high the oil for 10 years. My diabetes is gone. All the inflammation in my back is finally to where I don't have to take Vicodin anymore.

4009 2018-08-10 22:27:56 Scandinavia isn’t a country. Norway has oil but Sweden or Finland don’t and they have incredible healthcare. But take Portugal, my country. It’s far poorer than the US, we have free healthcare to a standard Americans can only dream of and our deficit is 1% of GDP. How about that?

4020 2018-08-10 22:26:41 You are.  You'd rather see Albertan's starve and go bankrupt than work in the oil industry.  You see yourself as one of these 'all knowing enlightened progressives' who is anti-development, anti-natural resources, and most importantly -- anti-prosperity.  It's shameful.  #2019

4027 2018-08-10 22:26:02 Norway also doesn’t have a bunch of crazy people who live far away and yet get to constantly meddle in their oil industry. 

So we want to be “like Norway”? Fine. No equalization payments and Alberta has sole decision making power over all energy policy. I’d be up for that.

4033 2018-08-10 22:25:53 I also ordered the nail brush thing for oil 
4034 2018-08-10 22:25:46 That was hard to watch.  He doesn’t even realize that eastern Canada already has refining capacity, it just needs a pipeline to be supplied with Canadian oil.

4041 2018-08-10 22:25:11 Will there be body oil or mud?
4042 2018-08-10 22:24:57 Considering the Majority of Great Britain's economy seems to be based on laundering Saudi Oil Money, one is not surprised at @theresa_may's cowardice  or the Tories silence with respect to the Saudis & Canada.  #UKpoli #CDNpoli
4043 2018-08-10 22:24:46 Because the UK Government can’t catalyse a war in Saudi in order to get their oil, so they take their filthy lucre instead.

4053 2018-08-10 22:22:23 So.... oil is the devils work and we shouldnt deive cars. Cool
4054 2018-08-10 22:22:01 Literally no one knows how or why humans exist on this planet.  Or what lies beyond our solar system. 

Technology gives us the sensation of being advanced, but we’re really just ants with guns and oil.
4055 2018-08-10 22:21:17 I am 25 years old. I think my penis has shrunk over the past two months. It has also titled to the left. I am unable to enjoy sex, though I do get aroused by the slightest stimulation. Is there an oil or cream that can help? I also experience pain because of kidney stones.
4056 2018-08-10 22:21:06 Not that I *want* this to be the case, I'd love to see the Cheeto Overlord in a vat of boiling oil, but I doubt his cronies will be in any way phased or disgusted by racist remarks - they're too inured to or enamored by his small-minded despotism as it is.

4058 2018-08-10 22:20:51 @fleetstreetfox Amazon, Google, Facebook etc are such vital pieces of national infrastructure that their UK operations should be part-nationalised, like oil fields. That would bring in a Royalty tax on gross cash produced, and also dividend on profits.
4059 2018-08-10 22:20:49 Apparently the majority of people in BC and the indigenous folks don't want leaky pipelines or Alberta tar sands oil

4063 2018-08-10 22:20:42 Further, and more importantly - the stationary seals can be lubricated from within the housing. Tiny amounts of oil, can be metered directly to the seal surface. This should reduce wear significantly as the seal will be riding on an oil film, avoiding metal-metal contact.
4064 2018-08-10 22:20:35 95% of Canada’s oil reserves are in the oil sands, where the extremely heavy oil is bitumen. Bitumen is used primarily for roads, roofs, and weather-proofing. Might explain why we need to purchase oil abroad.    Facts are cool.
4065 2018-08-10 22:20:34 I know this place. Have a nice trip. However I don't like Mossel Bay. It is a center of Oil, ships and petrol is not really cheaper.

4067 2018-08-10 22:20:18 We manufacture glasses, and use air to control our conveyers, and most of our robotics use air powered tools, and for drying as well. We have filters, oil water separators and line dryers on several large compressors. And all copper, no pvc.

4071 2018-08-10 22:19:35 I’ll never forget the day someone tweeted that when you suck a Yoruba girl’s breasts palm oil comes out LMAOOOOOOOOO I think it was Uma’s stupid ass too smh
4072 2018-08-10 22:19:17 Seems that soon after November midterm polls in USA, Trump with Saudis will push crude to $120/bbl to fund attack on Iran & its oil earnings. @narendramodi @AmitShah must look at this possible scenario before settling on next LS poll dates! Oil price shock a distinct possibility

4076 2018-08-10 22:18:55 I think my subconscious cooking knowledge was seeping in because I could tell they had burned a bit and become dry, then that was mixing with the frying oil to make it. It just kept happening. I got very frustrated with these onions.
4077 2018-08-10 22:18:49 I definitely think Labour should bring back Galloway! Apparently instead of working for barrels of oil he now works for saucers of milk!

4095 2018-08-10 22:15:19 Canada could always import 121,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabian competitors.  That way both Countries don't have to do business with each other, and Canada doesn't have to purchase 'Blood Oil'.

4101 2018-08-10 22:14:12 Well things have relatively eased for now. Specially with the rise in oil price. In any case the loan is coming from IDB and four billion dollar is not that much. And Pakistan is quite a commodity dont undervalue it !

4110 2018-08-10 22:13:19 Why we are making big headlines about Saudi. They are not a big trading partner with Canada. Just ignore them. 
Entire world know that they are funding all terrorists groups in world e.g. see 911 etc.
Lets bycott their oil (their bread and butter) as well.
4111 2018-08-10 22:13:18 I noticed that the @weeklystandard has a time warning for the #MAGAt readers. Lol wow. Acknowledging that a Snake oil Salesman lies is a glimmer of hope
4112 2018-08-10 22:13:17 And in Europe they make the cars to consume more fule than necessary because they probably own lot of stocks in the oil companies, plus they have a deal with governments that take huge taxes on the fuel!

4120 2018-08-10 22:12:18 FYI.  If you are looking to buy oil - our oil is among the least expensive oil in the world. Ask any western Canadian producer - they will confirm. WCS trades at a diff to WTI which is under Brent

4122 2018-08-10 22:12:13 All kidding aside, that is one gorgeous feline!
4123 2018-08-10 22:12:03 US killed several children and civilians to conquer Iraq but we didn’t do that.
In addition, what is fearful if the US is so powerful?
What are they doing here?
I know
To create war and control and plunder oil and energy resources.
And also pickpocketing arabs From fear of Iran
4124 2018-08-10 22:11:59 Iran is only a small part of the supply... The U.S. doesn't even use Iranian oil
4125 2018-08-10 22:11:55 Years ago, a man told me that he saw an oil company map (prior to the US involvement in the Vietnam War) that showed huge untapped oil reserves under Vietnam. He said that the war wasn't fought over communism.  It was fought over oil. If true, nothing has really changed.
4126 2018-08-10 22:11:49 Of course he has. He's an agent of big oil, corporate Dems - otherwise known as GOP-LITE, can't bear the thought of giving an ounce of power to the progressives, so has become the symbol of the corruption endemic to the dying 2-party system.
4127 2018-08-10 22:11:43 I get this is twitter but you know your tweet is less than accurate right?

EE would bring oil to QC and NB and the US.
4128 2018-08-10 22:11:34 You can just get oil like me and then you just need a battery pack
4129 2018-08-10 22:11:13 Same for anyone with a #foodallergy especially #milkallergy -dedicated fryer is essential . I have turned down many dishes simply because there was no dedicated fryer. And don't believe a restaurant that says the hot oil will kill the allergen or the gluten. It doesn't
4130 2018-08-10 22:11:03 We gave (not took) a lot of blood & treasure to save Western Civilation & rebuilt our enemies infrastructure. We continue to invest much more than they do for there defense and they turn around & set up a pipeline to their enemy & buy oil & send Euros to fund Putin’s army! SAD

4139 2018-08-10 22:10:10 Shoes that don't absorb easily with a layer of mink oil might help?
4140 2018-08-10 22:10:05 After my oil change I got coffee and I was in the left turning lane and this bozo was infront of me in their blue Chrysler and naturally I was focused on my straw and not the light. The light turns green and they just sit there...and I honked and  they started to move but
4141 2018-08-10 22:10:05 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
4142 2018-08-10 22:09:59 I have no alternate accounts. That makes you a purveyor of baseless conspiracies - like Alex Jones.

And like Alex Jones we would then have to shut down every leftist that peddled conspiracies about the 2000 election being stolen, Iraq war being for oil, Russian collusion, etc.
4143 2018-08-10 22:09:53 Amazing no sanctions on hsbc, but the uk has brexit looming and kissing the arses of oil rich countries to maintain it economy. Thus not only is the uk arming and training terrorists we are also doing their banking and helping them hide their money.
4144 2018-08-10 22:09:48 So don't buy plastic cups  Buy reusables like other eco minded people.. Don't talk the talk, if you don't walk the walk.. Get real. The current govt sees the need to broaden our oil customer base, also oil isn't a forever thing, but a necessary evil.. For now..
4145 2018-08-10 22:09:36 Yes and if I owned the Golden Gate bridge I'd sell it to you, like I said before if you don't like it here move, if it weren't 4 the Feds the dirty oil and all other resources in Alberta would still be in the ground so don't give the separatists farce, u want to be the 52nd state
4146 2018-08-10 22:09:28 Mother has sent me to beating the birch tree there, niece, which would have you must pour oil on our hinges; but you come
4147 2018-08-10 22:09:23 So overdue for a hot oil pie
4148 2018-08-10 22:09:21 What about skincare? I switched to a cream cleanser because my resident Sephora skincare expert said I was stripping my skin. She was definitely right since I haven't had oil problems since. Though in fairness I also started using a pricey peel at the same time.
4149 2018-08-10 22:09:10 Warm oil massage would be so perfect right now.... mmmmm
4150 2018-08-10 22:09:03 Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are a really good source for rendered chicken fat

Rub 4 of them with just a little bit of oil (maybe 1-2 tablespoon total), plus pinch of salt & whatever spices you want. Roast them skin side up at 220°C for 30-40 minutes. Pan will be full of fat!
4151 2018-08-10 22:09:02 This is correct. This amendment does not refer to oil.
4152 2018-08-10 22:09:01 If the definition of wet is “covered or saturated with water or another liquid.” Then can water be wet when combined with an oil?

How much olive oil would it take to wet the ocean?
4153 2018-08-10 22:08:48 Yep!!!
4154 2018-08-10 22:08:29 They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed

4157 2018-08-10 22:08:11 Fell into the YouTube rabbit hole watching Shito recipe videos. Noticed my heart was racing and realised I was having a panic attack watching them cook with all that oil. It's so yummy but I can't do it 
4158 2018-08-10 22:08:06 As she jumps, he jumps to the left. The grease and oil create a slippery lubricant. He manages to get away from the jump but trips right after he gets out of her way. He falls against the wall and starts to get back up.
4159 2018-08-10 22:08:05 We have refineries in the East. Oil in the West. 

Does it make moral/environmental sense to import mass quantities of conflict oil from the middle east, refine it out east, transport it by road and rail across the country and have our citizens pay way more?

Or build a pipeline?
4160 2018-08-10 22:08:03 The oil rice seller on twitter
4161 2018-08-10 22:07:48 Go ahead n kill urself...too much oil
4162 2018-08-10 22:07:42 We should refine oil for Canadians?
4163 2018-08-10 22:07:33 Stop it, tuna oil.
4164 2018-08-10 22:07:25 While I’m a pragmatic political moderate, I do functionally work for the oil & gas industry. So the DNC would rather eschew my financial contribution? I get foregoing money from oil & gas companies/execs, but screw all of us in the industry who are guilty by association, I guess.
4165 2018-08-10 22:07:17 <living bottle of olive oil
4166 2018-08-10 22:07:17 Ok, Bette, but I hold the U.S. just as responsible. Our jets, bombs, Intel, and for what? Mideast security? Oil?
4167 2018-08-10 22:07:01 @DNC is showing once again that the powers that be are no different than thier counterparts across the aisle by back tracking on donations from oil/gas/coal.

We need new leadership in the DNC, true progressive that align with the people.

No more centralist.
4168 2018-08-10 22:06:56 I keep a lavender stress relief essential oil in a lil compartment in my car

4176 2018-08-10 22:06:30 Maybe we shouldn’t take their oil and refine our own.
4177 2018-08-10 22:06:26 Because the "white" countries are terrorizing other countries. That's why. The US is funding the war in Mexico that's creating refugees and people are fleeing here because it's close. The US started bombing Syria and funding an oil war and now refugees are casualties.
4178 2018-08-10 22:06:23 Lool, mufc strategy of play isn't for me.. Las Las no cup for una
4179 2018-08-10 22:06:15 Canada should not be importing one drop of oil from any other country. Complete energy independence provides incredible national security, and we have that buried beneath our feet.  Too bad the government shuns it.
4180 2018-08-10 22:05:19 Tired: Canada doesn't need Saudi oil, we have our own!

4182 2018-08-10 22:05:03 @DNC @TomPerez I will never donate to the DNC as long as you accept donations from fossil fuel companies. Climate change is real beyond a reasonable doubt. Democrats will have no credibility to makes the changes we need to make if we're in the pockets of Oil and Coal.

4184 2018-08-10 22:04:42 Pretty clear that oil money doesn't buy brains or common sense. This isn't even anything here in Canada yet the Saudi's are fighting a world war because someone called them out for being a tyrant. Petulant children. Feel bad for Saudi citizens. Led by half-wits.
4185 2018-08-10 22:04:36 Looks like Iran wants to start blowing up more oil tankers. If this happens I'm sure President Trump will roll out the fury of Hell on Iran.
4186 2018-08-10 22:04:17 Can we encourage you to spend your time on preventing oil & gas fracking in residential areas? Asking for thousands of Colorado families.
4187 2018-08-10 22:04:15 To #twitterstorians hive-mind:

Anyone have reading recs for petrochems/plastics and postwar consumption? It will slot in just before week on oil & environmental activism. I'm looking for either an article or book chapter, probably to pair with a LIFE magazine analysis exercise.
4188 2018-08-10 22:04:09 Hey @TomPerez I have a new slogan for #DNC- "Drill baby drill " 

On a serious note this shows that #DNC has not changed one bit,they only money from Shell , Exxon and other Big oil. Next time they day they care about the environment  know they are lying
4189 2018-08-10 22:04:07 I’ve been slowly cleaning my way thru this apartment and it’s not dusty or dirty or even grimy, it’s just.... greasy. It’s like the previous residents exhaled oil everywhere
4190 2018-08-10 22:04:04 Anyone in the back there not on the payroll (unlikely) and with a brain (unlikely) must be cringing now looking at that charlatan selling, and them gulping down his snake oil.

4197 2018-08-10 22:02:54 Don’t blame you I did the same on the RS3 shortly after we bought it. Regular oil & filter changes keep the engine happy.
4198 2018-08-10 22:02:50 @PutinRF_Eng @MedvedevRussia #putin #medvedev #russia #usa #retaliation #sanction #usd #oil i would suggest Mr President and Mr Prime Minister to sell russian oil in € or Y or CHF or HKD or SGD but no more in USD. that's a first step towards a non-USD economy.  the future.

4214 2018-08-10 22:01:03 Mostly raw pastured butter, raw pastured soyfree eggs, raw cocoa nibs, beef heart & liver as mainstays. Some coconut oil, avocado, cheddar cheese, ground beef and  rarely chicken. Sometimes I cook the eggs up very lightly yolks still cool low heat in butter
4215 2018-08-10 22:01:00 I'm glad to hear you support refining Alberta's oil for Canadian's to use instead of exporting it abroad.

4229 2018-08-10 21:59:29 The oil is in the Somali region and it's not part of Ethiopia. The oil in The Somali region is Somali property and no single filthy ethiopean, small eyed dwarfs and Bedouins should ever take it
4230 2018-08-10 21:59:25 Thats fair, home cooked always better than fast food.

4250 2018-08-10 21:57:01 Here’s an easy side dish or snack: cut a sweet potato in half and pierce holes all over, drizzle olive oil, then sprinkle rosemary, pepper, salt and paprika (400F for 30-40 min). They are a great source of fibre and manganese which helps with vitamin absorption

4254 2018-08-10 21:56:06 @DNC is walking back its ban on fossil fuel donations after just two months. Shame on DNC for failing to stand up to Big Oil & show climate leadership. This kind of seals it for me. I'm voting Green Party in November.
4255 2018-08-10 21:56:03 my daughter made it once and I was amazed. avocado is a decent substitute for butter with its high oil content. but its not butter...nothing is butter..mmm
4256 2018-08-10 21:55:53 This electricity is produced with oil to run the turbines. It’s like generator
4257 2018-08-10 21:55:45 All oil is dirty right
4258 2018-08-10 21:55:44 As I Am Coconut CoWash, OGX Moroccan Oil, & OGX Coconut Collection are my personal favorites. I also don’t recommend sleeping with cotton pillows, it dries your hair out.
4259 2018-08-10 21:55:26 There are energy/oil companies that ARE good stewards. That DO have R&D departments that KNOW there will be alternatives. Those companies can lead the way.
Let them.
IMHO
4260 2018-08-10 21:55:22 Oil won't kill me? *drinks a jug of motor oil* you better be right...
4261 2018-08-10 21:55:16 The "Blue Wave" is contaminated by an oil spill
4262 2018-08-10 21:55:13 EPA and DOT reasons for walking back fuel efficiency rules are grovelingly absurd. For ExxonMobil and Chevron it makes perfect sense. Big Oil can fill its pockets with an extra half trillion dollars in chump change because it has Trump in its pocket. #IMPEACHTRUMPNOW #resist
4263 2018-08-10 21:55:12 @TheDemocrats So y’all are cool with taking oil company money again? Nice backbone ya got there.
4264 2018-08-10 21:55:07 So get cocumber and freeze it for 10 minutes before and put it on your eyes
Or get coffee seeds and almond oil and leave the mixture for a week before using and use it on your dark circles 
Also tea bags and freezed spoons are good 
4265 2018-08-10 21:55:06 i came home and dimple was like “too much highlighter”.

 GURL. I DIDNT PUT ANY HIGHLIGHTS AND THAT’S MY FACIAL OIL 
4266 2018-08-10 21:55:03 it kinda reminds me of oil paitings of landscapes
4267 2018-08-10 21:54:55 How often do you guys get your oil changed in your cars? I've heard anywhere between 3K-10K miles. 3K seems very low to me.
4268 2018-08-10 21:54:43 No need to even mention western Canada specifically. Is *Canada* not a nation? Are we somehow the least desirable source for oil? This is an opportunity to rally all Cdns around our shared national interests.
4269 2018-08-10 21:54:35 Pharma, "medicine" or rather a "Snake Oil Industrial Complex" and criminal bureaucracy are in a criminal collusion, force the population to pay an exorbitant tax, "health insurance", for mostly poisonous drugs. No pharma executive is in jail for deliberate poisoning, bribing MDs.
4270 2018-08-10 21:54:31 How about ban oil and fossil fuels entirely?
4271 2018-08-10 21:54:29 That and the fact that Andrew Scheer is lying. 

It makes far more economic sense to bring oil in from Saudi Arabia than it does to ship it across the country via pipeline.

Scheer will do exactly nothing in this file.
4272 2018-08-10 21:54:27 Carina rolls his eyes, immediately launching herself at him, throwing all of her body weight into it as she slams against him, hopefully knocking him to the floor. Honey, grease, and oil are everywhere. Gross.
4273 2018-08-10 21:54:20 You are no longer the USSR. You are a small economic country with oil and nukes. That is all. 

No one wants to buy anything you make except energy and arms. Your life expectancy is dropping. 

Now go play elsewhere.  I’m done.
4274 2018-08-10 21:54:17 Wait who said it?
4275 2018-08-10 21:54:07 If vegetable oil is made from vegetables and corn oil is made from corn then...whats baby oil made from.........BABIES

4277 2018-08-10 21:53:56 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
4278 2018-08-10 21:53:47 If you have actual cloves biting down on it can help. Try keep iflamation dow with the Clove oil it will help even if in small way..you need anti inflamtorypain meds.  Keep dstractin as long as you can. hope u get a sleep too xx
4279 2018-08-10 21:53:33 Numpty? Oil and gas earnings were declared "ex regio", meaning the earnings by pass Scotland and go direct to the Westminster Treasury, numpty. Next up, go  check the surplus power generated in Scotland that goes without payment, to where? Guess, numpty.
4280 2018-08-10 21:53:27 Trisha didn’t do anything but clap back. That oil chick outted herself about whatever. So whatever
4281 2018-08-10 21:53:24 Oil man just got me out the way with the 5/$20
4282 2018-08-10 21:53:06 We shouldn't be selling arms to them that's for sure. And I don't know why we buy foreign oil when we have enough here for our own demands. But trade is complex
4283 2018-08-10 21:52:58 I’m sure some of Mick Cornett’s  donors are big oil and Ackerman McQueen.
4284 2018-08-10 21:52:45 @cenkuygur Hey, Cenk.  I'm curious:  What do you think the repercussions would be for the United States if Saudi Arabia attacked Canada (as they claimed they might do) and our government turned its back on our neighbor and closest ally in favor of money, oil, and power?
4285 2018-08-10 21:52:41 wow.... any oil in that marker... no matter what oil brought them all to the store to buy.
4286 2018-08-10 21:52:31 Big oil helps elon.  Rather Ironic , don't you think?
4287 2018-08-10 21:52:29 When i eat fried foods i just feel the oil under my skin.. idk how to explain it
4288 2018-08-10 21:52:11 No the first thought was the systemic thought process by which gun nuts cling to guns like a pseudo extension of dick. No gun clinging here. I’m good. Try to keep up.
4289 2018-08-10 21:52:03 Even ppl on the short bus know it needs oil!

4295 2018-08-10 21:50:55 How can a leader of a federal party of Canada not support Canadian oil? Yet support foreign oil? Am I missing something. I know the ndp is useless, but really? Must be nice to be "some people". Say and do as you wish.

4300 2018-08-10 21:50:16 Stop buying oil, problem solved
4301 2018-08-10 21:50:14 She said there are no quarantine requirements (it was an effort to explain what quarantine meant and why it's necessary) and she explained that she was "informed" that the orangutans need supplemental feeding because people eat palm oil (?!)
4302 2018-08-10 21:50:01 I voted Al Gore and John Kerry. I wore bumper stickers "No Blood for Oil" on my car in the first month of the war. Those are Jewish financed wars. Bush and Blair were doing the bidding of Israel. Grow a pair of balls and stop letting Jews and Brown people control how you think.
4303 2018-08-10 21:49:53 This WTO bluster could be the snake oil to cure all Brexit worries and, if successfully peddled, could put the kibosh on any Brexit deal, which is something that seems a very remote prospect at this stage anyway.

But everybody laughs at you behind your back and if you didn’t have oil....well you’d just be a sand pit. Canada....well hey I’m surprised by you & delighted...keep it up...show the way.

Then gets on ant Saudi kick and says we should buy oil elsewhere.

Gives me the same confused visceral disgust I had when watching high school elections.Whomever was the loudest won. No thought required
4311 2018-08-10 21:48:23 infamous Baker Hudges report have some off shore new rigs.. First time years i see 20 rigs offshore for US. U.S. Rig Count is up 13 rigs from last week to 1,057, with oil rigs up 10 to 869, gas rigs up 3 to 186. #oott #usoil #crudeoil #hampetrol
4312 2018-08-10 21:48:11 Yeah I heard that years ago about Japan and Korea, too.  Meanwhile over here in reality the Russian economy is nothing without oil, Turkey's is crashing, China can't sustain itself much longer, and India is there to take her place for cheap labor ...
4313 2018-08-10 21:48:07 I just leave my cast iron pans on the damn stove too, like I kind of nest them and cover them, but I leave them there, with oil, and whatever in them, I turn a burner, sit it on there and start cooking.

4322 2018-08-10 21:47:05 The Saudi oil barons are friends with Trump though (as were with Obama’s). We just sold them billions of dollars worth of weapons to help them bomb a school bus
4323 2018-08-10 21:46:57 Libya was a gross invasion by Democrats to continue destabilization in the Middle East to control oil and weapons. I agree that the practices of ICE is not right, but the base argument of illegal immigration should remain:

4331 2018-08-10 21:46:28 Fuck @US_FDA thinking they're about to start charging $89 a fuckin pill for epidiolex, a new cbd based epilepsy drug. You ain't fooling anybody when there's dispensaries that sell cbd oil a hell of a lot cheaper than that.

4333 2018-08-10 21:46:02 I wouldn't even mind if they kept an ICE in it so they have some pointless service needs and an oil change once a year or so.  Put at least 30~60kWh in it and a hybrid traction pack with a boost ultra-cap good for 10 seconds and push the motor till in nearly melts in track mode.

4370 2018-08-10 21:42:07 The price of oil dropped in 2014 - the plug pulled in 2017.  Moving the goalposts and  resultant uncertainty drove the decision.

4384 2018-08-10 21:40:24 Second, Nigerian oil is conventional. And they don't bother to recover gas so they vent and flair, which makes their production much more GHG intensive than he oilsands. Turns out  regulations matter. And Alberta has the strictest regulations.
4385 2018-08-10 21:40:16 neti pot! it’s gross and awful but it feels so good when you’re done - or steam with like one drop of tea tree or peppermint oil
4386 2018-08-10 21:40:13 Venezuela oil can come right up east coast to eastern Canada . We don't really want AB oil. We want the oil patched closed ASAP.
4387 2018-08-10 21:40:12 I think it's time for some Evening Primrose Oil 
4388 2018-08-10 21:40:10 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
4389 2018-08-10 21:39:36 How low Canada has sunk trading maple syrup for oil. 
4390 2018-08-10 21:39:30 for real: when the President breathes heavily, Jesus subscibes to the #NYT
4391 2018-08-10 21:39:27 U may have the back of a KK & neo-nazi sympathizer, a man who mocks the handicap, a man who regularly sleeps w porn stars, and a man who supports Russia hacking our democracy........But me and more then half of America does NOT. please give back the snake oil u bought.
4392 2018-08-10 21:39:25 Our Islamofascist 'NATO Ally'. Erdogan's played on both sides of the fence, but ALWAYS on HIS side. Whether it's running arms to Hamas in Gaza, slaughtering Kurds, Christians and whatever Armenians left after the LAST genocide, or buying oil from ISIS, he's a duplicitous bastard.
4393 2018-08-10 21:39:23 congrats on the oil money
4394 2018-08-10 21:39:18 We shouldn't make a huge deal about it because that data series is very noisy, but the precedent set in the Taranaki oil ban has to be worrying.
4395 2018-08-10 21:39:15 They cannot deny they are at fault. Nine months ago, under English and co, this country was doing really well. Business confidence was up, near top of the OECD, employment figures really good. OIl and gas in place. How destructive they have been. Winston even warned us.
4396 2018-08-10 21:39:13 Yeah, I guess it depends on what you put under the umbrella of unethical. Could put all oil & gas producers, cigarettes, alcohol, social media, Amazon/Walmart for labor abuse, pharma, etc.
4397 2018-08-10 21:39:12 I always CUM with enough OIL.
4398 2018-08-10 21:39:11 @GauthierAmedee Wombats come from behind to beat Retif Oil (Jesuit) 7-4 with 5 run 6th. Might have been the best executed inning of my career.

4400 2018-08-10 21:38:42 Hahaha. Nimble as an oil tanker then, just as I thought.
4401 2018-08-10 21:38:41 A few things happen when it's this hot in LA but probably the most significant is the change in everyone's jars of coconut oil (20 million of them) from slippery solid to drippy liquid.
4402 2018-08-10 21:38:40 @Amtrak hey is it true no trains north of LA from OC because of an oil spill? Is there any way to get to Ventura from OC on train right now? Thank you!
4403 2018-08-10 21:38:25 Again, I do not want open boarders. I would like us to stop invading other countries, robbing them of what little resources they have and then making it harder for them to help their people. That's one reason we invaded Iraq..thought we were gonna get their oil, lol. Didn't work.
4404 2018-08-10 21:38:07 Once again I am going to say this
The ice age that changed the demographics of the planet  was that due to steel mills or coal mining or co2 or oil drilling or whatever you want to invent for the moment because there is no credible science to back it up.
4405 2018-08-10 21:37:51 Coconut oil on solid

4407 2018-08-10 21:37:19 I'ma try this CBD oil bs so I don't try to dig myself into a hole over my anxiety
4408 2018-08-10 21:37:15 By standing up for “families” do you mean making women stay at home and serve their husband?  Listen up assholes, no one here is going to vote for this charlatan save your money for your right wing goons elsewhere, pastor mark Harris is a washed up old snake oil salesman

4410 2018-08-10 21:36:47 First of all, bad analogy as conventional oil is typically found in sedimentary rock...like sandstone. This isn't the Simpsons and there isn't a large underground cave with oil in it.
4411 2018-08-10 21:36:40 Snake oil salesman.

4414 2018-08-10 21:36:20 Good luck lads. Bag a hat trick oil. YJB
4415 2018-08-10 21:36:14 I honestly think we need to quit buying oil from them too.  I'm surprised we actually buy oil from anyone but I guess I didn't realize that there isn't easy ways to move the oil down east.
4416 2018-08-10 21:36:12 Totally agree...cut ties with countries like Saudi Arabia...obtain oil elsewhere...there are other countries we could add to the list...but I'd run out of Twitter space...
4417 2018-08-10 21:36:03 It depends what portion of imported raw materials are required to manufacture before export. Any raw materials or by-products that are derived from oil will be more expensive.
4418 2018-08-10 21:36:02 But if we had a space force we could mine space oil for space cash and be rich.
4419 2018-08-10 21:35:58 I doubt if he knows where oil comes from ..another example of leadership voting process that all parties have adopted. Let's bring back delegate voting, paper ballots , and hand counted ..questionable results in every leadership election with electronic or mail in ballots
4420 2018-08-10 21:35:55 Let the oil companies pay for it themselves.
4421 2018-08-10 21:35:51 May not have a choice about importing oil. Some countries aren’t worth importing from #SaudiArabia #uae
4422 2018-08-10 21:35:50 okay there is an oil called bio oil is really good, you can start by using gentle scrubs
4423 2018-08-10 21:35:48 there's coconut oil in my eye
4424 2018-08-10 21:35:48 That early morning, when you're not paying attention, and instead of putting Golden Syrup on your toast, you've put Canola oil.
#FML #DontTasteGood
4425 2018-08-10 21:35:44 Can somebody please explain how Canada is at a disadvantage? The Saudis have already said they aren’t going to cut oil deliveries. 

What else do they offer Canada?
4426 2018-08-10 21:35:41 Do NOT ask your Twister friends. I have some of those (in my distant past) and it usually involves nakedness and oil. 

But yes, you're safe.
4427 2018-08-10 21:35:37 The hook in the jaw will be the wealth of Israel. Oil and natural gas, high tech, military are all desirable. The great spoil.
4428 2018-08-10 21:35:31 We’ll never close the gap with the price of oil these days.
4429 2018-08-10 21:35:19 Olive oil is a must in almost any mediterranean dish !! 

Eggplant is the missing ingredient !
4430 2018-08-10 21:35:08 That is one way. However, America's  (wars and destruction) is responsible for many of these poor countries condition. America has robbed many countries of the assets, ie diamonds, oil, etc., for the greed of money. We r not innocent of their suffering.
4431 2018-08-10 21:35:03 my coconut oil has gone solid again, never thought i’d see the day in that heat
4432 2018-08-10 21:35:02 Nice cup dear Anas, enjoy your coffee with feeling of oil
4433 2018-08-10 21:34:59 every time i come to get my oil changed they remind be how terrible i treat the mellow.
4434 2018-08-10 21:34:50 The Aussie hair oil is giving me life 
4435 2018-08-10 21:34:49 I love Eggs Benedict but I don't poach the egg, I cook it in olive oil Spanish style.
1. Add a lot of oil to a hot pan.
2. Tilt the pan toward you so the oil pools.
3. Crack the egg into the oil.
4. Use a spoon to ladle the oil over the top.
5. When the top is white it's done.
4436 2018-08-10 21:34:22 Or change tires. Or change oil. Or any basic car stuff lol
4437 2018-08-10 21:34:15 Kekefia, an ijaw delicacy. Unripe plantain with oil and meat, isam(piompiom). 
4438 2018-08-10 21:33:59 i cleansed the fuck outta my skin, did a flash facial, petrissage'd that shit, did another 15 minute AHA mask, and now i've got my fave oil soaking into my skin. face feel güd

4441 2018-08-10 21:33:38 2. They took our oil, our fishing rights
Their policies ground us down
Though we worked so hard to make ends meet
They treated us like clowns
They created many policies 
With sole purpose to undermine
We were so focused many mouths to feed
Didn’t see their plan at that time
4442 2018-08-10 21:33:19 making a sandwich with oil

15 sales licenses are for B2B only. 9 LPs selling clones, 2 selling seeds. #acmpr
4444 2018-08-10 21:33:00 Well that's just not true. The world oil price is not set by the transportation cost of WCS along the TMX. Any lowering of transportation costs will mean more money forthe government and industry. Unless you think the 2014 crash in oil prices was because costs fell...
4445 2018-08-10 21:32:57 Have you tried coconut oil
4446 2018-08-10 21:32:55 @AdvanceAuto 2018.08.10 Del City OK store. Went in to purchase a bag of oil dry/floor dry. Employee behind the counter said, "help you" with his head down while he was texting on his phone. I think Amazon sells floor dry.

4449 2018-08-10 21:32:34 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
4450 2018-08-10 21:32:18 Why didn't allies come to Canada's defense with Saudi Arabia? That's easy.  and oil
4451 2018-08-10 21:32:17 The price of oil was determined by  the world market, the Energy East pipeline business model did not make sense at this price point for the amount of investment required for this project.  Environmental costs are  now factors in development, and affect the bottom line.

4465 2018-08-10 21:30:15 It’s interesting they only put the kibosh on new business and left any established deals alone. You’d think if they were really. Mad they’d maybe cut off that trickle of oil we buy or maybe kill the deal that has them buying military vehicles off. Odd that.
4466 2018-08-10 21:30:13 Pop nutrition always annoys me. There's always some new miracle food or secret poison out there. 

Oil ain't gonna kill ya. 

Salt ain't gonna kill ya. 

Sugar ain't gonna kill ya. 

Fat ain't gonna kill ya. 

Not balancing what and how much you eat? That might kill ya.

4469 2018-08-10 21:29:58 He is and does. He's trying to give her the opportunity to do the same in debate format with him. Like I said.... "snake oil salesperson" is all she is. All show and no substance. Just like her supporters. #NoSocialism #MAGA #NoClue #MovetoVenezuela #Trump2020
4470 2018-08-10 21:29:52 Norway is the only Scandinavian country with oil. Educate yourself.
4471 2018-08-10 21:29:40 She’s a tireless fighter for the disadvantaged and vulnerable, passed the Homeowner bill of rights, attacks price gouging big oil, personally it’s her voice on Twitter, she’s always speaking sense to the issues we face
4472 2018-08-10 21:29:25 @alex_raij Hey Alex, hope you're well! I'm a journalist writing for NYmag. Could we talk for a story on olive oil?
4473 2018-08-10 21:29:08 Wash out the oil n the powder weh dem sprinkle a di stall
4474 2018-08-10 21:29:03 Thanks for the heads up as Branson's V logo is smeared all over fringe again. Will check CYGB out re: oil, gas and fracking, with ethical consumer orgs etc. If they come back clean, and apart from the Branson blight, fringe will be good feels again 
4475 2018-08-10 21:28:51 They need to think about building new refineries. 2020 the world converts to the American Diesel fuel standards (low sulfer).  The demand for this will go through the roof. We do not have the refining capacity to meet the demand. Can We say $300.00 oil!!!
4476 2018-08-10 21:28:48 OMG I’m waiting to get my oil changed and I opened a video on Facebook, and it was a joke video with a girl moaning !!!! A guy walked by right as I opened it he prolly thought i was watching a bad video I’m going to lay in the road now bye
4477 2018-08-10 21:28:31 owO
4478 2018-08-10 21:28:25 Oil isnt going away until renewables can support mankind. God wont help you. Production keeps on increasing with population growth.
4479 2018-08-10 21:28:16 Dems. 65.  Voted every election since 18. With few exceptions, VERY FEW-D-PROUDLY. Should u vote to reverse the decision to NOT ACCEPT donations from big oil, I will stay home in Nov. If u can't figure out how to win w/o their$, u can't figure out how to fix the US.
Bernie?
4480 2018-08-10 21:28:15 Of course the oil will continue... They want our money. Just no tweets lol
4481 2018-08-10 21:28:05 The problem for the asset-stripping Tories is that in the end, thee are no assets left to strip; they sold the utilities, the railways, the heavy industry, the oil and gas and the council houses. Now they are selling the  NHS. Anyone under 40 is very likely to be stuffed...

4487 2018-08-10 21:27:31 Don't you dare reverse course on taking money from oil and other like interests! We DO NOT WANT corporate DINOS anymore! You better start paying attention to the progressive wing of the party or you can forget about any wave in November.
4488 2018-08-10 21:27:24 CBD oil?
4489 2018-08-10 21:27:17 The oil can make the burn retain heat, runs risk of worsening the burn. But thanks for taking the time to share. 
4490 2018-08-10 21:27:15 We really could’ve switched over to electric cars in the early 90s, but oil greed.
4491 2018-08-10 21:26:44 Yeah but it we build new domestic refineries then we'll be locked into oil for decades to come and we can reap the rewards of a moribund market and ensure a future of Pacific beachfront property in Manitoba.
4492 2018-08-10 21:26:39 And I think the oil has to be used for like at minimum 5 years so... good luck diy-ing that one
4493 2018-08-10 21:26:23 Just smoothed on a nourishing face oil. Which actually involved rubbing in a significant amount of crisp crumbs. #messyeater #cheeseandonionexfoliant

Anyway my cell is 5705906491
4497 2018-08-10 21:25:43 It is. It is one of the strangest phenomenons in my lifetime. I wish i knew why people still fall for the "snake oil salesman." What is missing from their lives that lies will give them? The hypocrisy astounds me. The lies astound me!

4511 2018-08-10 21:23:45 Whoa. #FlagOnThePlay it is not advised to treat any burn w/an oil. My first aid training + experience prevents me from treating burns w/oils. Especially not knowing the staging of the burn.  Someone reading that may try it.

4518 2018-08-10 21:22:38 I bet he didn’t even know who they were playing either! “Thanks for changing my oil, sweetie”
4519 2018-08-10 21:22:29 Both are enemies.  More so now because we are no longer held captive by Mid East oil
4520 2018-08-10 21:22:25 Playing New Bedford and I have an expansion idea! You have to travel to Boston to sell the whale oil @dicehateme

4522 2018-08-10 21:22:03 when u dont have lube so u resort to using olive oil to mas//tur/bate instead

sorry not sorry lmao this route has just left me cackling at this ungodly hour
4523 2018-08-10 21:22:01 Dude! I am not the love of your life..or the anything of your life for that matter  cut it out
4524 2018-08-10 21:22:01 Unfortunately, Grant, the dye was set with your authoritarian sun setting of oil & gas industry, & Hipkins authoritarian banning of charter schools.

No coming back from uncertainty like that ... great example at the moment in Turkey. #FreeMarketsSmallState

4527 2018-08-10 21:21:28 China might just bail them out in return for selling oil at the Chinese oil market. 
I strongly believe USA is overplaying $USD hand. Global trade is conducted in USD & that give us unimaginable power which we used it to whip even our allies to bend to our will.
4528 2018-08-10 21:21:26 Use a clean mascara brush, dip it in almond oil and apply it everyday before you sleep

4531 2018-08-10 21:21:10 The atrocities in Yemen are not a left/right issue. It’s about arms, oil & finance. Primarily HSBC. Nobody acknowledges this. There’s a reason.
4532 2018-08-10 21:20:55 Yes indeed. Keep the lamps full with oil and enough in stock for the evil day. Jehovah Nissi, our Banner of victory.
4533 2018-08-10 21:20:45 When it comes to oil, America has become too big to ignore. China quietly illustrated this by removing U.S. crude from its list of targeted goods in the ongoing global trade war. (Bloomberg)
4534 2018-08-10 21:20:44 So @politicalham  is an extreme leftist. Good to know. I am sure all of his contacts and colleagues in the oil and gas sector will be interested in that news.
4535 2018-08-10 21:20:37 We have been sitting on the biggest oil reserves for generations, we have never used our own oil , and I highly doubt that’ll change under you
4536 2018-08-10 21:20:37 When they give you a free air filter and a discount on your oil change. I still finesse pregnant af.
4537 2018-08-10 21:20:34 Russia produced more oil then Saudi Arabia n we rely on Saudi Arabia for oil  n Saudi Arabia is making deals with Russia BRICS not us
4538 2018-08-10 21:20:33 Funny check out the current regents and what this one had done for himself in the oil industry
4539 2018-08-10 21:20:30 Calling on KSA to stop oil shipments to Canada until we nullify our corporate control of foreign mining operations and end arms trade exports to regimes like Ukraine. It’s hypocritical of Saudi Arabia to say it is embracing human rights when it props up Canada.
4540 2018-08-10 21:20:28 Oil rig workers and old men love to just throw their money at them. I deejayed at Racks for quite awhile. You wouldn’t believe how much some of these dudes (and women) throw at the dancers per night!
4541 2018-08-10 21:20:26 Bri, Always loved them.  Grilled with olive oil and garlic.  Hope all is well.

4548 2018-08-10 21:20:04 Here's an idea: let's let black women take the other seat at the table you're proposing giving to the oil companies! It's a win win.

4552 2018-08-10 21:19:35 I mean it if you’re ever feeling sad or down just run a roasting bath, put coconut oil and bubble bath in it, put a speaker on and blast some random Spotify acoustic album and sing it out!! IT IS the answer for almost any sad situation x

4561 2018-08-10 21:18:39 Very likely to happen with EU, China, India and Turkey NOT following the oil ban. Hmmm...find the mistake!
4562 2018-08-10 21:18:32 My favorite essential oil is bacon grease. Is that wrong?
4563 2018-08-10 21:18:23 maybe she dipped her leg in engine oil
4564 2018-08-10 21:18:22 They already get more money in general. The billionaire class is overwhelmingly on their side. They've already shown they have no scruples. And the general Democrat voter is as uninformed and dimwitted as American voters go. Might as well start taking oil money directly.
4565 2018-08-10 21:18:16 If the Saudis use their oil money to buy Tesla, I’d bet it’s simply to destroy the company forever
4566 2018-08-10 21:18:13 So fix the law instead of tossing it out and proposing to write a new one later. You don’t throw out the car because it needs an oil change.
4567 2018-08-10 21:18:06 Damn it. Dawn dish soap is the best and they use it to clean up animals after oil spills. These fucking pikers got their fingers in every pie
4568 2018-08-10 21:18:04 At My Greek Plate, the quality of ingredients is not something they're willing to compromise. They cook with Greek extra virgin olive oil, import most ingredients from Greece, source meat from Alberta farms and support local vegetable producers as often as possible.
4569 2018-08-10 21:18:02 Make it into a rag. Use it to check your oil, use to clean up filth around the house/yard.
4570 2018-08-10 21:17:35 We don't have enough oil to bck up our petrodollars
By ourselves that's why we use Saudi Arabia n why things are not lookn good , Saudi Arabia is master of trump n the Saudis are setting it up to have relations with Russia BRICS while Putin played trump like a fiddle,awake yet ?

4572 2018-08-10 21:17:08 bills due, new battery, oil change,  car wash & full tank all on payday  why am I an adult
4573 2018-08-10 21:17:04 Pipelines transport oil more efficiently than any other form of transport.  JT and the envirokooks are damaging CD A’s reputation, competitiveness and future prosperity
4574 2018-08-10 21:17:02 Wooden boats and oars can work just as good.  Shows what you know, only 4% of global oil is used for plastics.  And that'sthe most recyclable part of oil use.  Except for asphalt which is the most recycled product ever.  

Your argument is tiresome.  You didn't make one.
4575 2018-08-10 21:16:48 Maybe we'll stop buying their oil and start refining our own for a change..that'll teach em
4576 2018-08-10 21:16:46 Someone just told me olive oil wasn’t vegan and I said “what” and he just goes “bugs.” ???????
4577 2018-08-10 21:16:46 I baked mine with just a bit of oil and garlic salt. Sooo good

4584 2018-08-10 21:15:57 My bearish outlook for the rest of the year is looking good so far on oil price. U.S. crude posted 6th straight weekly loss settling at $67.63 per barrel. End of the year price could very well be trading at $58 to $62.
4585 2018-08-10 21:15:57 @BoyGeorge has "oil and water" been re recorded for "life"? Its one track im.looking 4ward to hearing )))))

4587 2018-08-10 21:15:51 If you’re heading on a trip, always ensure your car is up to the task. You’ll want to take a look at your tire tread, oil and coolant.

4589 2018-08-10 21:15:48 i need to buy some coconut oil 
4590 2018-08-10 21:15:42 Oooooo theirs was good too.  but nah that oil was great i needs all part start with that and the rest slight work
4591 2018-08-10 21:15:33 Burning the midnight oil! Looking great!
4592 2018-08-10 21:15:31 Pancakes achieved, but I managed to burn oil in the nice new pan  I'll see if I can clean it but it's being pretty stubborn. It's only a cosmetic problem really but it feels bad.
4593 2018-08-10 21:15:27 I just dropped my damn phone is some fuckin cooking oil

4597 2018-08-10 21:15:13 Happy #FF everyone...  wow.. as bad as  Hillary & others predicted, btw I've known he was a dkhead since the 80s, it is sooo much worse.. babies in cages, mothers deported, EPA pollution, asbestos,, oil drilling in Nat'l Parks, killing hibernating bears FFS..student loan frauds..
4598 2018-08-10 21:15:08 Nothing will motivate the base more than kowtowing to big oil.
4599 2018-08-10 21:14:41 Can’t wait to be like “yea, I’m a oil painter ”
4600 2018-08-10 21:14:34 Sorry to say before I started research on Fat Head, I threw away bacon grease and bought vegetable oil.
4601 2018-08-10 21:14:20 Ways to eat healthy and not have to do the most: 
NO WHITE BREAD- try wheat 
NO WHITE RICE- try brown rice 
DONT FRY - bake or grill 
DONT USE BUTTER OR VEGETABLE OIL- Olive oil instead 
NO PORK- chicken,turkey, fish ova erythang 
ALWAYS have a vegetable on the side 
Continue?

4611 2018-08-10 21:12:52 When you’ve got that much oil, you’ve got power
4612 2018-08-10 21:12:47 No need to spare oil when it's still very abundant and cost efficient energy. What the 1st world is doing it seems in my opinion is shifting wealthier countries to high cost electric and battery power to give low cost oil to the developing 3rd world who are now buying cheap cars.
4613 2018-08-10 21:12:43 Which would be a reasonable thing to say in a world without Trump. Chocolate ice cream is the opposite of vanilla ice cream right up until someone introduces castor oil as an option.
4614 2018-08-10 21:12:34 Cad needs to buy oil from Alberta.
4615 2018-08-10 21:12:27 We can talk about cooperative federalism and ethical oil until we are blue in the face, but it's private business looking to make a buck. As long as oil is produced in volume in countries with low cost it will be bought, regardless of where the moral compass points.
4616 2018-08-10 21:12:15 I would say familiarise yourself with the car. Know where your spare is and tools, how to use them, which oil your car takes and how to check it, how to check your tyre pressures/tread depths, and just keep on top of maintenance. If you look after your car, it’ll look after you!
4617 2018-08-10 21:12:01 In fact Canada should walk away from NAFTA start using our own oil and quit building weapons for #Saudi Arabia
4618 2018-08-10 21:11:57 What I like about Saudi Arabia
1. Oil
2. Oil
3. Oil
4. Oil
5. Innocent people
4619 2018-08-10 21:11:51 Because we want to get into bed with Big Oil? How could this go wrong?! </sarcasm>
4620 2018-08-10 21:11:48 Or why I just paid £194 for my first BMW service having done 786 miles  ! I assume they replaced the oil with Mouton Rothschild 1986 for that money
4621 2018-08-10 21:11:42 Guys..... I hear every 2 damn words. Sounds like hes talking into a oil funnel.
4622 2018-08-10 21:11:39 Of course they did! gonna see a lot more of that every time oil goes down.
4623 2018-08-10 21:11:38 I’ve only heard of the oil. Lol I didn’t know they did butters.
4624 2018-08-10 21:11:38 Ha ha ha Democrats are so greasy they’re going to take money from oil companies.  Just like when Cory Booker said he wouldn’t take money from corporate pacs and then he started taking money from corporate pacs @CoryBooker
4625 2018-08-10 21:11:35 And how much heavy oil do your ships burn per day ?
4626 2018-08-10 21:11:34 Me too! Or I would pretend the oil tank was a gas station and stop to get gas.
4627 2018-08-10 21:11:34 Lol. So are bad lawyers, used car salesmen, snake oil hawkers, lying teenagers teehee etc.
4628 2018-08-10 21:11:32 Use fragrance oils or fragrances that are made with mostly fragrance oils. OR you can get an argan oil (the Josie Maran light argan oil is perfect ) and warm/press it into your skin where you spray your perfume- it’ll last much longer.

4632 2018-08-10 21:11:09 didn't the forex reserves just run out and the oil price couldn't support the artificially strong rouble?
4633 2018-08-10 21:11:02 That was dirty oil and at the time when oil was low it took more cash then what it was worth to take it out of the oil sands. Yes and try and tell me there was no pollution from that. Freak the west they wanna separate from Canada go ahead get your own army, navy,dollar,pensions
4634 2018-08-10 21:10:59 09   Rental cab gone back with oil leaks and other probs. Picks up a replacement cab and I have to put 7litres of water in it , got no sidelights and the hickory is 25 mins slow.. joys or renting.

4638 2018-08-10 21:10:20 Jordan Peterson: a hysteric, right-wing, fascist reactionary snake oil salesman. Charlatan. Refuses to go on platforms that would actually challenge him. Embarrassing.
4639 2018-08-10 21:10:05 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
4640 2018-08-10 21:09:57 Canada 1.6%. But Boreal forests offset to negative numbers. If Canada doesnt produce oil another jurisdiction with ZERO regulation will take that market share. Canada not producing actually makes it worse.

4642 2018-08-10 21:09:51 lol. You cant see the CBC article in his post?

"Singh pitches payback for Saudi spat - buying our oil somewhere else"
4643 2018-08-10 21:09:42 It's Friday night and I'm stuck on an oil refinery in northern Sweden.  the joys.

4645 2018-08-10 21:09:33 Hey BC! If you don't want Alberta oil in your province, keep your fucking smoke to yourself!

4648 2018-08-10 21:09:05 He was a better Minister of Oil, when he was allegedly buying Syrian and Iraqi oil from ISIS. Allegedly pocketing billions for the regimes bank accounts. Not so easy trying to deal with the countries finances, when everyone can see your not fit for the appointment.

4656 2018-08-10 21:07:54 I say good. Banning oil and gas money is dumb. The DNC needs to take as much money as possible from as many corporations as possible to eliminate the GOP / Trump shit show. This bilious stance that somehow the DNC is principled and gives a fuck is WHY WE LOSE.
4657 2018-08-10 21:07:31 It seems that oil and gas really hate this policy idea but have been poor at making it completely go away.
4658 2018-08-10 21:07:19 here you go... " It is infuriating to see NDP and Liberal politicians prefer to buy oil from other countries."   Hope this helps..
4659 2018-08-10 21:07:05 Nah they over charging you. You can buy your own oil for cheaper than that.
4660 2018-08-10 21:06:56 Or maybe don’t let the day go by without reaffirming your commitment to fighting climate change and not taking money from oil companies.
4661 2018-08-10 21:06:53 E61 still cleaning up the oil spill along I street at 102nd. #OFD
4662 2018-08-10 21:06:40 I’ve found that tea tree oil is really good at drying out acne without drying out your skin !!
4663 2018-08-10 21:06:33 Turkey forgot it's nato membership when they bought oil from isis and let them pass the border. Germany moved from Incirlic long ago, because they weren't trusty allies.
4664 2018-08-10 21:06:31 Having oily eyelids is great because the oil gets in my eyes and then my eyes start burning 
4665 2018-08-10 21:06:29 Not sure why.   Source countries of imports of crude oil and equivalents to Canada in 2016 were 62% from United States.   Free trade agreement.  We export low grade.  Import high grade.   To be self sufficient we need to consider building refineries.
4666 2018-08-10 21:06:04 Solar and alternative energy companies should be the funders of the DNC. There can be only one Gas and Oil Party.
4667 2018-08-10 21:05:58 Put some lavender oil on it
4668 2018-08-10 21:05:53 I use coconut oil all over my body at least once a week before i shower. its soo good for my shitty skin
4669 2018-08-10 21:05:34 That's what Big Oil would say 
4670 2018-08-10 21:05:25 "Well do they have oil? then what's the fuckin point" - Dick Cheney, 2003
4671 2018-08-10 21:05:25 #acmpr @indivalife and The Flowr Group get their dried sales licenses, @Aurora_MMJ  (2nd site) and @blisscohealth get their oil production licenses, @KoLabProject  gets their oil production and sales license, and UP Cannabis Inc. gets oil sales license
4672 2018-08-10 21:05:23 Hey guys does anyone know what makeup companies contain no -sustainable palm oil? Because truly I am going to try to make a conscious effort to reduce my personal effect on the deforestation and Orangutan killing and I plead that others do the same
4673 2018-08-10 21:05:18 bro how do i unsubscribe from cruz alerts they woke me up at 7 AM today with a phone call about an oil spill 
4674 2018-08-10 21:05:14 Squash and beans served with wild herb sauce (fennel/marjoram/wild spinach blended with anchovies and oil) Blackberries with cold sweetened cream and lemon zest!
4675 2018-08-10 21:05:04 I mean, unless they do it indirectly when the grifter in your Twitter headline pic allows coal, oil, and gas companies to poison people for profit.
4676 2018-08-10 21:05:00 All these while sef anever realize say a never chop oil rice for outside sef before. @anguamowura you really open your eye
4677 2018-08-10 21:04:40 obviously i can't speak for you but it's been fine for me, it also says to test a tiny bit on yourself first so if it feels irritating or painful wash it off immediately!! if you do decide to look into it i'd recommend nair with argan oil (smells way better)
4678 2018-08-10 21:04:36 Ok, free advice on inducing labor from a #doula (aka: Me). 

Stop taking castor oil to induce. You will get the horrific shits, possibly vomit, and dehydrate yourself. If by some chance you do end up going into labor around the time you ingested the oil. If there is an attempt at
4679 2018-08-10 21:04:20 Looking at #telemundo @Telemundo and Chinese maybe look like mischief,  oil rich
4680 2018-08-10 21:04:15 Sad thing is @Kokomothegreat there's no good option, she has blown people up, muslims, for oil. So is he, he's still signed to Saudi Aramco, In the UK we also have people like this, the best option was Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn,,
4681 2018-08-10 21:04:14 @NDP Hey dudes.  How about the Alberta oil patch. Every think of that????? Just wondering why you would want to go anywhere else.
4682 2018-08-10 21:04:13 Must Saudi always get a pass because they have oil? Must we let the butchers of children in Yemen get away with murder because of petroleum?
4683 2018-08-10 21:04:05 No one refuses to admit that we were heading into a recession in 2015 what we are sick of hearing is how they did so much for us since. Chasing off 84 billion in investment, oil is up 57K on social assistance highest ever & part time jobs. They have done shit bit mount debt
4684 2018-08-10 21:04:01 vegetable waxes 植物ろう animal fats 動物性脂肪 palm oil パーム油
4685 2018-08-10 21:03:55 Performing at Lucas oil is a dream that I will never forget 
4686 2018-08-10 21:03:52 Don't forget Russia too! They are still going against sanctions on N Korea and continue to sell them oil. Transferring at sea during nights.
4687 2018-08-10 21:03:25 What the hell is the deal with synthetic motor oil? I want my motor to be lubed up with real liquified dinosaurs not some fake made in a lab Jurassic Park kind of shit
4688 2018-08-10 21:03:22 Make sure in the deal they give you a banging drivetrain warranty because if the outside is looking like that I'm worried about the engine someone was lazy and probably never changed the oil till it got traded in
4689 2018-08-10 21:02:57 Oh I see!  Well that’s makes it all ok then, silly me.

Do you happen to know who ships the oil into Canada?
Is it possible Paul Martin’s shipping company is making any money on it?
I wonder if it’s discounted more than 50% like oil from Western Canada is when they sell it to USA
4690 2018-08-10 21:02:56 This is exactly why we have to be more than a one trick oil pony. Oil essential, diversification just as essential. We will always be a prisoner to these oil busts unless we truly deal with incentives for diversification
4691 2018-08-10 21:02:52 I'm not an essential oils expert, but here is something to try. Keep some lavender oil in your kitchen. Next time you burn yourself, quickly rinse with cold water, then generously & repeatedly treat w/oil. It's better than anything else for both relief & healing.
4692 2018-08-10 21:02:52 Like the oil?
4693 2018-08-10 21:02:36 Lord, we got Padma Lakshmi for you
Let her massage your back with blackseed oil
4694 2018-08-10 21:02:31 No no no. You’re wrong! Let’s import oil from gender equality, humans rights respecting countries, like... Venezuela or Russia or Qatar instead producing our own. Come on! Be « logical » and consequent.
4695 2018-08-10 21:02:31 Wow okay 
Dumps oil on and sets self on fire
4696 2018-08-10 21:02:29 Did they spot oil?
4697 2018-08-10 21:02:28 IF I COME IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE JUST DO THE DAMN OIL CHANGE DON’T COME UP TO ME WITH THE OTHER PROBLEMS MY CAR HAS, I WILL DEAL WITH THOSE LATER BUT TODAY I WILL JUST DEAL WITH THE OIL CHANGE 
4698 2018-08-10 21:02:21 You can have all the oil you want but if you ain’t got that #fire your lamp is useless- #OilandFire
4699 2018-08-10 21:02:19 "The more than 40 speakers praised Trump for withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, a global agreement to fight climate change mainly by cutting carbon emissions; 
& for rolling back regulations to allow oil companies to lead the biggest energy surge in the nation’s history"

Today, I rang out a woman buying a foam mattress pad, new sheets, and 3 bottles of baby oil
4703 2018-08-10 21:02:05 Interesting oil concept
4704 2018-08-10 21:02:04 I need one of them vapes with the dope oil in it...
4705 2018-08-10 21:02:00 A lot of things are coming together for me with $tsla twitter. 

The "Big Oil" thing makes a lot more sense now. Bulls basically see the Saudi's as having infinite money and are able to fund anything for any reason. This is why "Big Oil" is so scary. Also why they will get rich?
4706 2018-08-10 21:02:00 That’s so f***ed up. I hope Oil Wife Life is okay. I only recently started watching her videos...but I’m still troubled about this .
4707 2018-08-10 21:01:58 i still can't believe sephora gave me a bottle of sunday riley ufo oil for free that one time
4708 2018-08-10 21:01:49 You ain’t an oil painting anyway 
4709 2018-08-10 21:01:45 You are right. Price of oil dropped steeply.
4710 2018-08-10 21:01:37 Tramadol made her so sleepy and dozy. She’s a 10yo French mastiff, she’s dozy enough!  
Coconut oil a good shout tho, I’ll get some tomorrow and start her on that. She’s just so heavy on the back end.
4711 2018-08-10 21:01:36 Beard oil on tap?
4712 2018-08-10 21:01:34 Once Alberta separates then they can buy our oil, at a larger cost of course.
4713 2018-08-10 21:01:13 Who needs them, without oil, who cares.
4714 2018-08-10 21:01:12 I want to give kudos to the FORD Folks at the Windsor Engine plant in Ontario Canada in 1991 y’all built my 5.4 litre TRITON engine The lady has run at 160 degrees her entire life

4717 2018-08-10 21:00:57 Tobacco and oil now mix? The manipulators want you to believe that. No, it is not that! Our colonizers are doing these things deliberately so that we blame our leaders, and they become under pressure to succumb to their cheap demands! The deals, agreements or treaties Signed???
4718 2018-08-10 21:00:57 August 10, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

4722 2018-08-10 21:00:24 My old lab Megan was on tramadol morning & night, kept her happy till she was almost 17 . Coconut oil is great for their guts if other stuff upsets them, big teaspoonful at bedtime works wonders, good for joints, coat etc too
4723 2018-08-10 21:00:04 Atlantic Canada should be “importing oil” from Alberta and Saskatchewan. This whole thing screams Energy East

4726 2018-08-10 20:59:42 What ARE you on about? The key focus of my work and that of Orangutan Land Trust is to address the threat of unsustainable palm oil on orangutans and their rainforest habitat
4727 2018-08-10 20:59:42 After primer try using a bit of serum or oil mixed in with the green to help ?
4728 2018-08-10 20:59:36 Forgot to put coconut oil on my face, upset!
4729 2018-08-10 20:59:34 Exactly, I'm agreeing with you.  It was a business decision.  If the price of oil had been higher than when the original application went in they surely would have kept working to make the project happen.
4730 2018-08-10 20:59:30 i need the dodge dealership to understand and respect the fact that I pulled up for an oil change not to waste my time.
4731 2018-08-10 20:59:30 I will never get over the fact that jojoba  oil is pronounced ho-ho-ba oil.
4732 2018-08-10 20:59:29 Started at 8 finished at 11 got a cut went to the gym oil change and it’s not even 5
4733 2018-08-10 20:59:25 bro go away and dig some oil or some shit
4734 2018-08-10 20:59:23 @RealCandaceO is a joke.  She isn't any different than the snake oil salesmen of the past.  She feeds the bull shit to the zombified sheep whose idea of truth is anything they want to believe.  Her snake oil feeds the hate to the hateful, and they down that swill joyfully.
4735 2018-08-10 20:59:13 Gerald look like oil lol
4736 2018-08-10 20:59:12 Paris 1.5-2°C requires ~80% of known fossil fuels remain in the ground (unless huge levels of highly speculative negative CO2 tech are assumed). Shell are still seeking more oil not planning to retire their existing assets.They may be prepared to help stay below 4°C, but not 2°C.

Couscous

Almonds (optional)
And a little bit of oil, salt, and pepper!
It tastes AMAZING!
4741 2018-08-10 20:58:54 I agree. I want my province back, King Ralph would put those UN arseholes and Ottawa in there place awfull quick, even Obama calling our oil, dirty oil. from the largest polluter on the planet? wtf
4742 2018-08-10 20:58:47 Man I just changed my own oil son.... feel good about myself
4743 2018-08-10 20:58:31 Apply castor oil after u use them every time, lash tech or not. Castor oil keeps them growing
4744 2018-08-10 20:58:11 1) Do you feel that any of those job losses might have been a result of $30 oil?
2) Have you noted the improving economic stats ?
3) Did ND's get rid of the jobs or did the fat cat excessive private sector not see boom ever ending and then laid off everyone?
4745 2018-08-10 20:58:04 You can also use actual coconut oil once a week or so. Put it all over your head, rub in to your scalp, let sit for 5-10 min and then shampoo/condition as usual. Hair gets sooooo soft
4746 2018-08-10 20:57:57 Almond oil! Massage a few drops under your eyes before bed. Also is a nice & light moisturizer for face and hair

4754 2018-08-10 20:56:36 I asked how long my oil change appt would be since he asked if I would need a loaner, he said bout 4 hours bc they’re busy. 4hours?! I don’t wanna drive home and then back... fuck
4755 2018-08-10 20:56:31 activities but that the impact needs be considered.  This did add extra work to the application which ,if the price of oil was higher, may have been worth it.  2/2
4756 2018-08-10 20:56:26 You may be inclined to forgive his ignorance when you understand that Jagmeet Singh doesn't realize that Canada to, produces oil.

✓ Controls the flaking skin on my scalp from seborrheic dermatitis 
✓ Actually makes my hair feel pretty silky smooth
✓ Smells like two hundred butts
✓ Gives me a great excuse to treat myself to bougie Argan oil conditioner
4762 2018-08-10 20:55:49 don’t have access to a garage anymore lol I don’t even do my own oil changes anymore.
4763 2018-08-10 20:55:47 By nationalize you mean implement energy infrastructure TransCanada. I know our European counterparts would definitely favour our product because we can make anything from it. The sweet crude is a myth because most refineries outside Canada are equipped for heavy oil.
4764 2018-08-10 20:55:43 Venezuela was basically the model state for commies a few decades ago when it had like the 4th highest GDP per capita in the world. Horrid policies have destroyed that nation. When 96% of your revenue comes from oil, this is what can possibly happen.
4765 2018-08-10 20:55:32 I need some almond oil and jojoba oil for my cuticles. I treat my natural nails so harshly.
4766 2018-08-10 20:54:54 an avocado is technically a fruit. by seed oils i mean high omega-6 oils from seeds of grasses. soy, wheat, corn, sunflower, flax, whatever the fuck Crisco is lol...all that nasty stuff basically

avocado, coconut and olive oil get a pass for various reasons (a bit technical)

4775 2018-08-10 20:53:09 Of course, you are right.  Calm, is the way to go.  This ethical oil thing, may never be solved with so-called "cooperative federalism"
4776 2018-08-10 20:53:08 Let's be honest, that probably has as much to do with the collapse of oil as it does with the NDP. #YYC #Alberta #oil #oilandgas
4777 2018-08-10 20:53:07 I pity the Palestinians having  ‘ supporters’ like you. You pour oil on flames. You bring nothing but lies and propaganda to the table instead of working towards mutual respect ,difficult bilateral concessions to create an irrevocable peace accord.

4795 2018-08-10 20:51:03 “Sometimes I wish I was closer to the ground so my falls wouldn’t hurt as much.” He closed his eyes, sighing dramatically. He then shook his head with a chuckle, “sorry, too edgy?” 

He would then proceed to beat the eggs and powder, allowing Sayuri to add the oil and water.
4796 2018-08-10 20:51:02 Honestly, CBD oil is my life saver. I had a panic attack right as I was ready to fall asleep last night. Normally, I’d be up all night scared to fall asleep until my eyes physically couldn’t stay open. 
I used my CBD oil, and was asleep within 20 mins. 
4797 2018-08-10 20:50:35 Peppermint oil. 
4798 2018-08-10 20:50:31 Something tells me they don't want to do without oil.

4806 2018-08-10 20:49:50 It’s not that hot, cooking it in oil reduces the heat
4807 2018-08-10 20:49:40 But hey-let's build a pool on the beach with #tidelandfunds and drill for oil in the wetlands!  We can always pile sandbags around them @suziepriceLB3

4810 2018-08-10 20:49:19 Maybe the whole thing is to make Saudis and other oil money (also small investors but this is a side effect) to hold non-voting shares? So that they can't take Tesla down?
4811 2018-08-10 20:49:15 Dark skin that isn’t shining. So whenever they don’t rub enough cream or oil, they look ashy. People like that need to take extra care of their skin.

Trans Canada pulled the plug on the project due to costs associated with meeting the NEB's requirement list of issues for the application dated 23/07/17.  The application is dated 2014  Oil dropped by half, in that time the margin was to tight.

4817 2018-08-10 20:48:17 I use the argan oil shampoo that Costco sells and it’s amazing, but it’s a fine balance between too dry and too oily...I wanna try the Monat shampoo and see if I can grow it out again. I miss my long hair.

4819 2018-08-10 20:47:54 You should have one of your loaded phony panels to seek the truth about #Omersoa?Hook all the white folks up to their jeopardy buttons and stand back! It has to be a scientific outcome. It must be the Truth! You are a nothing but a snake oil salesmen

4828 2018-08-10 20:46:36 For young Tsitsipas to knock off Theim, Djokovic and Zverev in successive matches is awfully impressive. The kid's on-court demeanour is rather refreshing and serves him quite well. #RogersCup

4834 2018-08-10 20:46:22 It really shows who is committed to de dollarization and who's not. China occupies the top spot on the TIC data. Russia isn't even on the sheet. (despite being the 6th biggest economy by PPP and the biggest oil/gas exporter)
4835 2018-08-10 20:46:17 1- releasing criminals is BAD. (see chaos in #Ethiopia)
2- unplanned humanitarian work is BAD. (see UN budget deficit)
3- price collusion for oil sales is BAD. (see Margrethe Vestager)
4- unmonitored UN is BAD. (see oxfam in Haiti).
4836 2018-08-10 20:46:08 We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

Oh well, my 'bag for life' will see me through. :)
4839 2018-08-10 20:45:55 It's not chicken vs egg--it's just chicken. The simple truth of gov't is there are far too many politicos that make money the old-fashioned way--through oil, gas, and coal. Where there's a conflict of interest people act willfully ignorant. We can educate The People.

4854 2018-08-10 20:44:19 I think the major problem with the kwuli kwuli oil is processing! We export it to be processed and then import it back to Nigeria. Oil get levels sha
4855 2018-08-10 20:43:50 Ouch! That's not awesome, Alex. If this ever happens again, we suggest using a soft cloth with some vegetable oil to gently wipe the eye area and remove the essential oils that crept in there.

4909 2018-08-10 20:34:49 I have been thinking the same thing. I predict Trumps independent investigation into Yemen bombing will conclude that the Yemen government did it and not Saudi Arabia. Oil and Arms are a wonderful investment = UK US complicit. Black Dollar= No Soul

4931 2018-08-10 20:32:40 They must be drinking their own oil? 10-30? Or heavy crude...lol
Sure do forget how Canada came to their aid when Saddam was burning down their oil rigs? New kid leader...one day he'll grow up? One can only hope!!

4934 2018-08-10 20:32:09 Mr Nashiri is still alive while 17 American sailors are not, and 39 sailors were injured...

"Mr. Nashiri was facing the death penalty over charges he helped plot the Cole attack, which killed 17 sailors, [and] an attack on a French oil tanker in 2002 that killed a Bulgarian man"

4939 2018-08-10 20:31:41 I don't see why not...I use coconut oil as the oil base
4940 2018-08-10 20:31:40 Yes. Agree oil is important. But so is Israel...S.2497 recently approved by Congess gives Israel $3.3 billion p.a.... for next 20 years.

Umm no. Drink water bc ur body needs it to function properly. Put tea tree facial oil on every night and stop touching your face. 
4953 2018-08-10 20:30:34 Well since i clear over 100k working in the oil fields, I don’t need to milk cows. I’m sure you can figure out which prison their daddies are in

4964 2018-08-10 20:29:02 I’ve a lovely friend who must have invested a few grand. She’s been to weekend training courses. Nobody can be ill without hearing which oil could cure. No stain in the house is sacred.
4965 2018-08-10 20:28:59 It was like an oil can for my joints! And I was super productive when I got back! 
4966 2018-08-10 20:28:48 @Walmart 2 1/2 hours for an oil change most days of the week. I never have that much shoppingvto do.
4967 2018-08-10 20:28:46 I did lol I put oil & butter cause that’s how I make my grilled cheeses & it still fell apart and stuck to the pan ):
4968 2018-08-10 20:28:33 gosh if only we could use a pipeline to ship oil to eastern Canada ….then we would not have to import ….. or actually refine all our oil ourselves.  Inconceivable ;)

4972 2018-08-10 20:28:05 Thanks for the tip, Max doesn't have bare areas, and his skin isn't red. And every morning we gave him coconut oil over his dry food (is good for his imuumsysteem and coat) and every night we gave him a sheep fat with garlic bonbon. 
4973 2018-08-10 20:28:04 I would be in favor of a complete embargo on Saudi oil and severe sanctions until they join the rest of the civilized world in the current century and for once begin treating ALL people fairly and stop their backward and barbaric ways. #SaudiArabia
4974 2018-08-10 20:27:59 The Oil shall surely flow.
4975 2018-08-10 20:27:50 @SecretaryZinke met with oil and gas associations since he has taken office more than any other special interest groups! He’s offered up millions of acres of federal land for leasing  and coastlines for drilling. Enemy of the state!! Sad state of affairs at @Interior

They don't need it
4990 2018-08-10 20:26:15 DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO GET OIL PAINT OF CLOTHES
4991 2018-08-10 20:26:06 I now REALLY hope it breaks hard here. Looks like products demand will be ass. And the fact that US oil production is down the last two weeks and yet we have a sell off is quite telling. I interpret that as the market knowing US oil production will pop right back up quickly.
4992 2018-08-10 20:25:48 taking evening primrose oil pills everyday is the best thing I’ve done for myself
4993 2018-08-10 20:25:38 I am with you all the way, except please explain the oil angle, really if you want to follow me, I will follow you back and you can dm me if that works better for you.
4994 2018-08-10 20:25:36 This shows the rest of the World, where they stand. Canada calls out KSA fpr Human Rights Issues. KSA responds with actions which do not make sense to most. US, UK, & EU do not support Canada publicly. Guess that OIL is thicker than BLOOD. Shameful.....Allies in sev. wars.....

4999 2018-08-10 20:25:16 Looking back I think that whilst I completely agree that Blair colluded in an illegal U.S oil war that had nothing to do with freeing Iraqis from a tyrant, Galloway exploited it for his own ego and ends. I think the only thing important to George is George.

5011 2018-08-10 20:23:04 I put that beard oil on my beard and my beard is feeling so smooth
5012 2018-08-10 20:23:01 Personally I like paying less per year on gas, so why are we only talking about this from the climate change angle? Oil is a finite resource, so the only way to pay less is to increase fuel economy or find alternative fuel sources.

5020 2018-08-10 20:21:45 They're not keen on Saudi oil either. That might bring a Saudi troll or two to the shores of NZ....

5030 2018-08-10 20:19:59 my mom bought some cheap ass bread. I tried making a grill cheese and the bread stuck onto the pan and broke apart yes I put oil to smhhhhh
5031 2018-08-10 20:19:51 Yeah.  I was walking to my car, holding my baby, slipped on oil in the parking lot, I remember covering his head/body, and didn't even think about bracing "me"  People coming out of store saw/helped. I went home and dealt with it. 2 wks later   I finally went to Dr.
5032 2018-08-10 20:19:31 I'm sorry..... @benshapiro doesn't need her to build his brand. She won't debate because he will intellectually crush any chance she has of building her own brand and expose her for the "snake oil salesperson" that she is.
5033 2018-08-10 20:19:22 Pcv is way cheaper, pull it and the tube and check for blockage? If it's blocked it'll caused excess blow by and force oil into turbo and intake system becoming exponential in the problem.
5034 2018-08-10 20:19:18 Do god oil companies they are not going to be able to monopolise electric charging like petrol, electricity is everywhere &if they price to high EVdrivers will only use in emergency. They will make more money by providing good coffee & nibbles/ shopping etc while people charge.
5035 2018-08-10 20:19:06 Yes to bringing tankers loaded with oil to our coasts but no to tankers coming in to pick up Canadian oil. Why I will not vote NDP.

5044 2018-08-10 20:18:13 The ol corporate whores pedaling their future solar energy votes to Big Oil. Again.
5045 2018-08-10 20:17:59 I propose that we nationalize our oil. The profits should be paid to Canada, not to foreign and transnational corporations.

We can use that profit to pay off the national debt and green our infrastructure, in that order.

5047 2018-08-10 20:17:54 No fossil fuel money, @TomPerez. Seriously. Go be a Republican if you’re going to serve oil, gas, fracking, off-shore drilling, oil spills, climate extremes, and rising sea levels.

5049 2018-08-10 20:17:28 Seems to be the PCV leaking oil into the air intake hose going to the turbo. The dealership said it was the turbo and/or oil lines and would be $5k to fix. Took it on myself and discovered this once I got it fully torn apart.

5052 2018-08-10 20:17:20 Put things in context.  Price of oil!
5053 2018-08-10 20:17:20 Your country is a dictatorship. Canada believes in freedom. How dare you lecture a democracy when your country still believes in the Devine right of kings. If the KSA has no oil you would be living in the 6th century.
5054 2018-08-10 20:17:13 Gotta love the 'foreign funding' attempt... 

how much did KM, a foreign company, spend lobbying in Canada last year?  Or other foreign big oil companies? Smh...
5055 2018-08-10 20:17:07 Yes like everyone.  But they are more worried about Midland oil than our pricey output.  Further we have no export infrastructure to take market share.  Saudi population growing rapidly - hence diversification.

5057 2018-08-10 20:16:53 I’m not sure Dem Socs think that exists. Jacobin publishes Bruneig weekly and pushes the line that Norway is socialist because they have a big oil fund that garnishes corporate profits.

5060 2018-08-10 20:16:43 @realDonaldTrump All sanctions are running without impunity and most countries are running, President Trump is committed to lifting Iran's oil exports to zero by November, and we will not retreat at this price. I'm sure that Iranian oil exports will end by November 4th.
5061 2018-08-10 20:16:40 No need. We own a good chunk of the arctic ourselves. Plus the oil sands. Plus offshore oil deposits like the ones the US is using to become a bigger oil exporter than Saudi Arabia.

5065 2018-08-10 20:16:24 Yay more pollution with there heavy fuel oil engines. Great stuff
5066 2018-08-10 20:16:07 My wonderful husband got me some CBD oil for my pain    Hospital on Wednesday and planning on getting some on nhs .
5067 2018-08-10 20:16:05 Conversely - stop paying out our taxes to big oil, farms, pharma etc. and start paying people to teach, fix infrastructure, develop new technologies. That's what drives the world forward.
5068 2018-08-10 20:16:00 Munchkin is always fun, and dunno if it counts but Snake Oil is hilarious when everyone is drunk
5069 2018-08-10 20:15:50 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ알겟옹ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
5070 2018-08-10 20:15:33 Are you stoned? Bush cared only about oil and $$$.  DT actually cares about every CITIZEN of this country!
5071 2018-08-10 20:15:30 So oil Arabs rule the world? lol
5072 2018-08-10 20:15:21 Your Tesla uses more oil than a gas engine car Danny
5073 2018-08-10 20:15:21 Snake oil salesman!
What you think about Scottish Affairs is irrelevant
5074 2018-08-10 20:15:20 My man bought a new weed oil and it literally made us act like crackheads that was the most fun I’ve had in awhile
5075 2018-08-10 20:15:17 rigs up both in oil and nat gas but no one cared today....
5076 2018-08-10 20:15:15 Coconut oil and Mario Badescu girly!
5077 2018-08-10 20:14:50 HAZARD... 102nd and I to about 96th... possible oil spill
5078 2018-08-10 20:14:20 How is this even legal?  I swear the GOP has gone to such a dark side - all thanks to a con man. An INSECURE con man who has sold them all a fancy snake oil.
5079 2018-08-10 20:14:06 Here's the thing about Saudi. We need their oil. That makes them very rich. We need to sell them something at exorbitant prices or they end up with too much cash and end up buying the West and using economic power to undermine our societies.
5080 2018-08-10 20:14:06 6/13 cleansing conditioner and my new favorite dry oil
5081 2018-08-10 20:14:05 You're a performance artist and a snake oil salesman, not a crusader for any kind of actual improvements in the world. You know how I know?

BECAUSE IT'S WHAT *YOU* TESTIFIED IN THE COURT CASE *ABOUT* YOUR CHILDREN"S DESTINY.
5082 2018-08-10 20:14:01 And nobody said anything: Ruhr Oel GmbH in Germany, Nynas Oil in Sweden&Belgium&UK, Havensa in the virgin islands and many other assets from Citgo: Lyondell, Sweeny, ..... as well as hundred of thousands tank stations and distribution systems.
5083 2018-08-10 20:13:43 What infrastructure? They are pumping oil today in NFL, and could easily send it to Irving in NB instead of shipping it away.
5084 2018-08-10 20:13:42 Buying oil from other countries? What’s wrong with buying Canadian oil? Build the the damn pipelines. Bring back Energy East. What a dipstick.
5085 2018-08-10 20:13:27 하는 거였으면 친추 할라 그랬는데 아쉽구먼~~~여튼 좋은 정보 아리가또~!
5086 2018-08-10 20:13:24 My daddy always said, “you can’t drive it if you don’t know how you fix it.” So I basically did my own oil changes n lil stuff like that for a while...then I started paying for it cuz..my nails duh.
5087 2018-08-10 20:13:03 謎の野菜VSおれ
5088 2018-08-10 20:13:00 But Canada are the evil one's.....

This also explains the hey none of Canada's allies have come to our defense.

Stop dependence on foreign oil, make Canada a super power. #canadafirstforonce
5089 2018-08-10 20:12:47 If Reham Khan Stoops any Lower
She'd Discover Oil Reserves ;) 
5090 2018-08-10 20:12:35 Again more oil shipment will increase oil spills; very misleading you left Burrard inlet out from your July 5 blog
5091 2018-08-10 20:12:31 first mistake is.. why you going somewhere for a $40 oil change 
5092 2018-08-10 20:12:29 Took my car in for an oil change and transmission flush and because it was making some rattles and squeaks. Rattles and squeaks were because of a broken tie rod, brake pads in need of replacing and 4 bald tires. This has been an expensive trip to Midas.
5093 2018-08-10 20:12:18 And Turkey is a large imported of oil and products ! So it’s a real issue !
5094 2018-08-10 20:12:09 I make happpy for the oil rice seller
5095 2018-08-10 20:12:05 The oil part of the interview was almost 3 minutes long. You quoted 12 seconds
5096 2018-08-10 20:12:04 Latest addition to the My Magic Mud collection - activated charcoal peppermint Dental Floss!! Non GMO, Vegan - contains peppermint oil for a refreshing taste + coated with xylitol for optimum oral defense! Might make the flossing habit a little easier to implement!!!
5097 2018-08-10 20:12:02 As in Jagmeet Singh. Not opposed to buying foreign oil (Saudis). Just Canadian oil. So f**g stupid.
5098 2018-08-10 20:11:54 A good CBD oil is hard to find to ensure it works. In FL, they carry it, hemp oil really, but it has been a blessing to my step-daughter. It totally got rid of her constant pain around her right ovary. Wish we had found this before she had 2 surgeries to try and fix her pain.
5099 2018-08-10 20:11:27 Sen kan du säga "trams" hur mycket du vill. Ska du besöka Bosnien snart igen eller? Är det också trams? Hur går det med de oskattade villorna i Kroatien förresten? Eller folkmorden utförd av Lundin Oil? Är det också trams?
5100 2018-08-10 20:11:25 Also Tell her to take the time at to educate herself and watch YouTube tutorials! We don’t want babygirl growing up feeling like her hair is an issue. I recommend filling a spray bottle with cold/warm water conditioner & olive oil and detangking her hair with that. Then braiding
5101 2018-08-10 20:11:23 Would those comparisons be a bad thing?  Alex sells a LOT of that stuff, because just about every product he sells kicks ass, haha.  Despite the left's claims that it's all "snake oil"; if you sell a good product, they will buy.  Seems like a good way to drum up extra sales, heh.
5102 2018-08-10 20:11:13 Another time, because of the veggies, I had to convince them I wasn't making salsa, even though I had a large bag of serrano peppers (that I roast and put in oil, to top meat with as a condiment). I really hate where I live, every damn store is like this.
5103 2018-08-10 20:11:12 Lads. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a crushing defeat. So brutal.
5104 2018-08-10 20:11:08 I’m really no Michelin chef but is their a better smell in the kitchen then red onion & garlic slowly cooking in Olive Oil #Chef #Foodie #OliveOil #RedOnion #Garlic #Cooking #HomeCook #delicious @jamieoliver #MichelinGuideUk
5105 2018-08-10 20:11:02 Oil
5106 2018-08-10 20:10:57 Lots have logos of German oil and gas companies on so...Germany? I'll ask next time. I get a sandwich at the shop next to them most days...
5107 2018-08-10 20:10:56 I think I'm leaking! Ahhhh, I'm leaking! There's oil everywhere!
5108 2018-08-10 20:10:49 Yeah, she'd have to brush up on her Orwellian and double-speak to stand a chance. Doesn't she know, that nomenclature is for bullshit artists, snake oil salesmen and political pundits? Silly millennial, huh?
5109 2018-08-10 20:10:46 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
5110 2018-08-10 20:10:31 옹..이젠 마비 끊은거니?
5111 2018-08-10 20:10:29 When you stop burying the dead from fuel poverty & reveal how much tax renewable companies  have paid in the last 30 years then you can laugh. What? Renewables haven’t paid much tax if at all whilst the oil & gas have been paying 62% tax rate in the good times. Now who looks daft
5112 2018-08-10 20:10:26 oil?
5113 2018-08-10 20:10:25 The wild animals are in danger right now tooo...our public lands too.. they're going to destroy it all for mining oil n fracking. We DON'T WANT THAT IN OUR PUBLIC LANDS!
5114 2018-08-10 20:10:20 Does the Canadian government ever discuss getting our oil from Norway? Genuinely curious why we aren't doing business with a country that funds the world's best welfare system through oil? They might even throw us some lessons in how to run a developed country.
5115 2018-08-10 20:10:16 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil
5116 2018-08-10 20:10:12 I can sing Oil Spill just like the lady from Bob's burgers and it is so annoyingly hilarious.
5117 2018-08-10 20:10:05 Lesser than who, exactly ? And what traits are you using to define lesser ? 

So you want to grow up in a world where a raving lunatic yells at a microphone, spinning wild stories, in order to sell snake oil ?
5118 2018-08-10 20:10:05 Endless oil story
5119 2018-08-10 20:09:40 True, & oil is just an example. There could be tons of finite resources on other planets other than oil, giving Thanos more reason. His plan worked when he single handedly massacred people. He’s the mad titan, not logical titan.
5120 2018-08-10 20:09:39 Got given some extra virgin olive oil from my sisters olive grove, and some of her homemade Limoncello. #OneGoodThing
5121 2018-08-10 20:09:27 Put lavender oil on my pillows last night, thinking it'd help me sleep. Ended up putting on too much, making the scent overpowering, preventing me from sleeping  
5122 2018-08-10 20:09:15 I've just been drilling for oil with Liz, Nobu, and Kintoki Rider all day
5123 2018-08-10 20:09:12 28oz Paraquat, 16oz LV6, 16oz of Sitka (Crop oil), a drift agent @ 15gpa TeeJet Turbo Twinjet nozzles.
5124 2018-08-10 20:09:10 America backed saddam to use gas weaponry on Iran, wont lift a finger during the Kurdish genocide, but as soon as he messes with the oil export they get the Gen pop to go back shit crazy.

5129 2018-08-10 20:08:32 Girl I’m just letting this oil sit on them
5130 2018-08-10 20:08:21 *global heat wave hits*
Leftists: this is a clear example of anthropogenic climate change.
Republicans: *sipping oil like a fine wine* nah sometimes it just be like that.
5131 2018-08-10 20:08:19 You realize world oil supply is not just Canadian Oilsands on one side and conventional on the other right? You can also look at the GHG reduction learning curve afforded by the scale of oilsands. Unsure why Quest sequestering 1.8MT of CO2 doesn't count.
5132 2018-08-10 20:08:01 You may as well have spliced his responses word by word so you can put yourself in a better light.  He said a lot more about Canadian oil.
5133 2018-08-10 20:07:53 the freaky hunchback girl who loves brains so much are WORKING for big oil
5134 2018-08-10 20:07:50 i need to hack this recipe with a sugar-free option. And dark cacao and coconut oil.
5135 2018-08-10 20:07:49 Blocking the view of those majestic oil derricks.
5136 2018-08-10 20:07:49 Alternatively, take a slab of puff pastry, roll it out into a rectangle, cut an inch wide strip off each side and flip each strip onto the rectangle to make a raised border. Layer sliced cherry tomatoes and red onions in the centre brush with oil, sprinkle with salt and bake,
5137 2018-08-10 20:07:45 なんか解析力学の解いてて気持ちいい問題集とかないですかね。原理と物理的意味が解いた後理解できる問題とか、誘導がしっかりしてるやつとか
5138 2018-08-10 20:07:40 They should try spraying CBD oil on white rights rallies.
5139 2018-08-10 20:07:30 I want my car detailed inside and out and I need s oil change
5140 2018-08-10 20:07:28 'Each night the banks of the Tigris are illuminated with oil lamps, lanterns, wind tapers and torches, and people arrange [them] in thousands of artful ways... so that the lights are drifting from one side to the other, and the darkest night becomes like a brilliant day.'
5141 2018-08-10 20:07:22 Right from the start Canada’s oil producers have called out how our oil is ethical oil and yet eastern Canada blew them off and even after all of the recent events continue to support and buy foreign oil.
5142 2018-08-10 20:07:09 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
5143 2018-08-10 20:06:58 And so the family money wasn't from wildcat oil drilling....or at least not all of it was.
5144 2018-08-10 20:06:40 No just oil. And they are prefilled and not refillable
5145 2018-08-10 20:06:39 @Toyota_India If some thing happened to the engine the dealer will not consider it as a manufacturing complaint.

Oil consumption issue is not a rare case. All etios diesel vehicle owners are facing the same problem.

Most of these etios are using for taxi purpose in
5146 2018-08-10 20:06:25 @Toyota_India level or do service at every 5000 km ,and the interesting thing is ,they also don't know the way ,the oil disappear from the engine.

Since the service warranty is only up to 100000 km , I am very much worried about the engine condition after the warranty period.
5147 2018-08-10 20:06:22 Rashford and #10 oil and water 
5148 2018-08-10 20:06:16 Not just combat vets Its offensive to construction workers, road crews oil roughnecks truck drivers ship wrights coal miners sand hogs long shoremen fishermen loggers farmers & all sorts or other ppl who love this great country more than a silly game Stand or go broke !!!

5150 2018-08-10 20:06:11 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil ?
5151 2018-08-10 20:06:08 So BC is jailing Grandmothers and Pastors for protesting a pipeline, that will carry raw bitumen for the American oil companies in Alberta.

It's mind boggling this is happening.    @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
5152 2018-08-10 20:06:06 centre people they just simplified the matter and told me that this much oil consumption is a normal thing and nothing to worry.

Since I was curious to know the reason of oil consumption, I asked them regarding the solution . Then they told me that you can either top up the oil
5153 2018-08-10 20:05:47 That's because the poison you cooked will start kicking in.Better go find Palm oil drink when you're done
5154 2018-08-10 20:05:46 They are moving as fast as they can. Canada is a cancer for oil and gas companies. Over regulated.
5155 2018-08-10 20:05:40 it’s so hot as soon as i step outside my face suddenly has enough oil to grease 10 frying pans omf
5156 2018-08-10 20:05:38 There’s nothing wrong with a little used car oil  it’s amazing
5157 2018-08-10 20:05:35 Who the flying fishsticks puts an oil filter on with a air-tool? This shit is why I change my own oil.
5158 2018-08-10 20:05:35 You need to stop hitting the oil and go outside to catch some sun!
5159 2018-08-10 20:05:32 In terms of ingredients, vada pav has carbs(pav, potato) and fat(from the oil it is fried in). But very little in the way of protein and other nutrients like vitamins and minerals. Can survive on it in a pinch, but it won't provide all necessary nutrients. So not a full meal.
5160 2018-08-10 20:05:29 Just gave Greg a bomb ass massage with baby oil and everything and now we’re doing shots of tequila as he plays Diablo and I watch Shane Dawson videos. Mom and Dad life.
5161 2018-08-10 20:05:26 Oil
5162 2018-08-10 20:05:15 I heard tea tree oil and help get rid of keloids caused by nose piercings!
5163 2018-08-10 20:05:06 What sort a fuckwit believes a Snake oil salemans like Trump? Sorry John for the bad language, but these evangelists are driving me nuts.
5164 2018-08-10 20:04:59 @Hi , I own a Toyota etios diesel vehicle (2016 model) which I am using for taxi purpose.

I have noticed a severe oil consumption in my vehicle after its 40000km service. When I checked the oil level at 46000,the oil was just above the lower dot mark.

When I approached service
5165 2018-08-10 20:04:58 @BeratAlbayrak @KmlttinYlmztkn @TRTalarabiya @RT_Erdogan @rterdogan_ar dear Turkish brothers and sisters I’m Syrian petroleum engineer working in Azerbaijan  for last 13 years in the oil and gas industry I swear to God I will put all my Foreign currency in Turkish banks

5168 2018-08-10 20:04:27 True *calls parents for a oil change 
5169 2018-08-10 20:04:22 Lol not at all. My old HR Manager had potpourri, the melting oil pot, diffusers, etc 
5170 2018-08-10 20:04:20 try boiling a pot of water and letting the steam hit them, that mixed with the cocunut oil helped mine come off.
5171 2018-08-10 20:04:13 The oil in condom is reducing and nobody is saying anything about it
5172 2018-08-10 20:04:12 I love having to pick a oil and gas, charter school founding candidate for governor because the other one is a literal KKK member yes Colorado is very progressive like everyone likes to claim!
5173 2018-08-10 20:04:12 Getting an oil change is the longest hour of my life
5174 2018-08-10 20:04:09 Homeboy just hooked me up with some oil and a new pen now to get paid to play video games
5175 2018-08-10 20:04:06 One of my exes just told me he thinks I’m disgusting. Sorry mate but you shagged a girl up the arse with cooking oil, nuff said
5176 2018-08-10 20:03:59 Yeah, that's what @LenPetersonJr pretends it is. He also tells people he's in the olive oil business.
5177 2018-08-10 20:03:57 I sell brake oil and brake pad incase u need a brake
5178 2018-08-10 20:03:52 The Earth is on fire - even in the Arctic Circle! - and yet this guy is protecting the oil and gas industry?!! #climatecrisis #climatechange
5179 2018-08-10 20:03:37 WTI Oil, I bought LONG this morning at $ 66.98, sold at $ 67.70. Going forward, I will be a Buyer at low $ 67s and a Seller at high $ 69s. Going out to diner here in Bermuda @jonnajarian @jimcramer @FuturesNow
5180 2018-08-10 20:03:37 And I already got oil on my clean like that blue joggers #fuckthisplace
5181 2018-08-10 20:03:34 Geraldo- unfortunately, Saudi is a strategic ally in terms of oil, keeping Iran in check. They just bought arms from the US last year. It’s a total tough call..
5182 2018-08-10 20:03:23 I’ve been procrastinating on changing my oil, but today I’m going to do it, if it doesn’t rain.
5183 2018-08-10 20:03:23 He made his money in the oil industry.
5184 2018-08-10 20:03:14 Hi , I own a Toyota etios diesel vehicle (2016 model) which I am using for taxi purpose.

I have noticed a severe oil consumption in my vehicle after its 40000km service. When I checked the oil level at 46000,the oil was just above the lower dot mark.
5185 2018-08-10 20:03:06 Indiana Summer. oil on ash wood board.
5186 2018-08-10 20:03:02 Immigrants. Not illegal immigrants.  When the left quits conflating the two perhaps an honest convo can be had.
5187 2018-08-10 20:03:01 You’re assuming oil is a primary resource on all of these other planets that Santos intends to wipe out half the population from. Oil is our resource, but we never got a definition of what Titan’s exports and imports were
5188 2018-08-10 20:02:36 Your statements reveal that nothing is clear to you, and that your worldview is orthogonal to an honest assessment of reality. I'll give up my dedication to the Bill of Rights when you move to a vat of boiling oil, dipshit.
5189 2018-08-10 20:02:35 If any of y’all suffer from almost dehabilitating cramps like ya girl i HIGHLY recommend cbd oil :)
5190 2018-08-10 20:02:31 I was really hoping the cafe would be open while I got my oil changed, but here I am thirsty af
5191 2018-08-10 20:02:29 Every time I come in plaza tire to get an oil change, they wanna tell me about something else that need to be done . I didn’t come here for that! I just wanted my oil changed ppl!
5192 2018-08-10 20:02:19 Oil change
5193 2018-08-10 20:02:07 He cares less about us then The EPA cares about the environment. If trump wins a second term our country will not be  Unrecognizable. The latest trump administration is now looking to drill for oil in the Grand Canyon. Do you really believe he cares about anything . Just money.
5194 2018-08-10 20:01:51 Full house every game , unlike Arab oil F.C.
5195 2018-08-10 20:01:38 If you think we can continue or increase our burning of oil with impunity, you are not paying attention. We are killing the planet and people. Increased CO2 (and other gases) means increased temps > extreme weather > fires > diminished resources and food > more wars! #FactsMatter
5196 2018-08-10 20:01:30 We both know a rudimentary knowledge is diff than functional knowledge.  Hey I'm just a dumb truck driver what do I know? 
Been great, gotta go do my 14 hrs and do my share to fuel the nation and get the oil where it needs to be. Have a blessed day.
5197 2018-08-10 20:01:23 ehm.. let's see.. mushrooms, kimchi, rice noodles, bean sprouts, green onion, kale, chicken broth, sesame oil, soy sauce, sriracha sauce
5198 2018-08-10 20:01:14 Why do they sell out and get nothing for it. The Oil money will got to Republicans...duh.
5199 2018-08-10 20:01:11 Oilsands are less carbon intensive than many oil sources around the world, even before you factor in everything else the Alberta government is doing. Your position supports Nigeria, Russia, Venezuela etc. who all have more carbon intensive crudes.

5201 2018-08-10 20:01:07 You want to hear about the bacteria that eats oil spills? It was the first patent for bioengineered life form in the US. It eats carbon rich material.  But isn't all life on earth carbon based? What is flesh eating bacteria? We shouldn't play God, we're not smart enough.

5203 2018-08-10 20:00:57 Idk why getting your oil changed is so simple but I put it off till after the last minute every single time
5204 2018-08-10 20:00:47 This castor oil better bless me tf up
5205 2018-08-10 20:00:43 That reminds me of the joke about the Somali pirates who captured an oil tanker.

"Give us $10m"

"Sure. Keep it for another 6 months and we'll give you $20m..."
5206 2018-08-10 20:00:30 But you see, life such as plants and animals are renewable. The resources that are what he calls “finite” like oil, etc are truly finite. Unless he did mean plants and animals that would just mean he fucked up and didn’t think that gives the team another reason to fix what he did
5207 2018-08-10 20:00:28 You better NOT reverse your decision to ban contributions from oil and gas. You will effectively smash the blue wave and completely lose what little respect is left for the democratic establishment. DON'T DO IT!!!
5208 2018-08-10 20:00:03 You found oil of slipperiness. #DnD #ADnD

5210 2018-08-10 19:59:50 IIRC Japan had a limited supply of fuel oil for their fleet. Their choices were attack now, and probably loose. But maybe not!

They knew if they waited they would definitely loose because their fleet would be immobilized.
5211 2018-08-10 19:59:45 Why - because you say so? Evidence it. Natural resources? Which ones? Selling to who? Where’s the infrastructure? Peak oil was all the rage in the SNP campaign. If we’d gone Indy after that last referendum our economy would have sunk without trace. Remember the oil price?
5212 2018-08-10 19:59:43 yo la llevo cagando a la VISA, casi no usola, me lo enseño el kilombo q comenzo en 2001, solo garpar gas oil y las zapas ( 3 cuotas me quedan)

5215 2018-08-10 19:59:14 RESTORATION:- Why does older wineskins find it so hard to receive new wine? Because it takes DEEP MESSAGE by loving hands [with softening oil] to remove stubborn wrinkles and return it back to use… FOR SOME THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH!
5216 2018-08-10 19:58:52 Pissing all the north sea oil money up the wall on tax cits, while the more sensible Norway invested it
5217 2018-08-10 19:58:38 I have Fibromyalgia and when my pain is bad essential oils have been my go to. I mix Peppermint, Lavender, Rosemary and Frankincense oil. 10 drops of each in a carrier oil like coconut oil or olive oil. Ask your husband to massage the oil in for you if your in too much pain.
5218 2018-08-10 19:58:38 It is ironic that two worst countries which exports nothing but terrorism(well thr is oil) calling canada not to interfere. God,kill me
5219 2018-08-10 19:58:37 Our system is flawed in lots of ways, but it has served the US pretty well. Overall, the immigrant population is better educated, more entrepreneurial and more law abiding than the native born population.
5220 2018-08-10 19:58:29 If the Arab States didn't have oil and wasn't so close to Iran and Israel would we really care about what goes on in these nations?
5221 2018-08-10 19:58:27 Someone wanna take my car to get its oil changed? I don’t have time & I really need to get it done.
5222 2018-08-10 19:58:26 We see you @ContinentalTire & @Lucas_Oil........
5223 2018-08-10 19:58:17 I’m sad that Turkey decided Erdogan was preferable to Democracy. 

Turkey is lucky it doesn’t have oil riches like Venezuela, it means it will get rid of Erdogan before it gets too bad

5226 2018-08-10 19:58:01 If any good is to come from this it would be for the Liberals and Conservatives to work together to get some oil pipelines built.

5232 2018-08-10 19:57:16 Try the loc method! Moisturize, oil, and twist her hair at night
5233 2018-08-10 19:57:16 But it's not. Haha! Today's is a two part wash day. I 1st prepoo by heating coconut oil, sectioning my hair and putting a generous amount of the oil. Then i put Aphogee conditioner and do vikutis, tie chitambala. Tomorrow i shampoo and condition. Moisturising conditioner.

5238 2018-08-10 19:56:47 Do I get my oil change or get my hair did?

5247 2018-08-10 19:54:58 I absolutely hate waiting for my oil to get changed.... hence why I’m 1200 miles over the time I was supposed to get it done 
5248 2018-08-10 19:54:38 Its what you shout when the oil light comes on in your NSU engined Mazda
5249 2018-08-10 19:54:35 Sorry are you suggesting the orangutans at Camp Leakey 1) are living and independent life and 2) that palm oil in Tanjung Puting NP necessitates supplementary feeding?
5250 2018-08-10 19:54:33 The date is official...before i announce it...i need 2 females to oil down bodies for the pool scene!!! ... Serious inq...
5251 2018-08-10 19:54:33 we don't buy much Saudi oil, we buy most of it from the US. that's why I say stupid in Ottawa has to go, we should be working with the US and Mexico not protecting 3500 dairy farmers, and the next time someone bashes our oil patch we need to tell them to fuck off! not politely
5252 2018-08-10 19:54:33 My view is, immigration in general needs to be redone for next 50 to 75 yrs with economic and fiscal concerns primary. The general welfare depends on it. The system now is not fit for 21st century issues we will confront.
5253 2018-08-10 19:54:31 Coconut oil can fix everything

5256 2018-08-10 19:53:59 @BankoftheWest says they do not wish to invest in extraction industries, yet they have no problem depositing paychecks and down payments from hard working men and women in the oil/gas fields and coal mines. #Hypocrisy
5257 2018-08-10 19:53:54 I am conservative economically. Liberal with other policies. NDP are the reason our economy hasn’t recovered like other oil rich nations.
5258 2018-08-10 19:53:50 Ahhh, a classic "saving the world" Tesla argument. If only the biggest representatives of Big Oil would help Tesla out!
5259 2018-08-10 19:53:43 Demand is increasing b/c of increased wealth in developing nations as well as China. Oil demand will increase ~20% by 2030. But that is only assuming that alternative energies don’t surpass oil. We are ~5-10 away from adv. battery tech that will significantly reduce oil needs.
5260 2018-08-10 19:53:41 “Oil and gas companies are the greatest threat to the species...”.  So Beluga Whales are endangered because of modern, non-Inuit practices, yet the Inuit hunters are blamed for killing one. Just brilliant.

5268 2018-08-10 19:52:07 If Trudeau took a principled stance, he would have to force through pipelines from Alberta rather than refining Saudi oil now, wouldn't he?
5269 2018-08-10 19:52:00 Following all patriots, please follow back. That UAV doesn't need oil changes either, so the Dems can save money for important stuff like more pink hats and booties.
5270 2018-08-10 19:51:59 Or you can hear them. And you can have them looked at for free every oil change.  At 3K per oil change and 50k miles - they would be looked about 15 times for FREE!   Why worry?
5271 2018-08-10 19:51:47 We're very sorry to hear this, Halley. Please contact our Instant Oil Change customer service team at at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can provide assistance.

5276 2018-08-10 19:51:02 The Canada-Saudi dispute has stabilized:
-Saudi hasn't announced new measures in 2 days
-Canada has maintained its low-profile approach of not pouring oil on the fire and working quietly with allies
-Each side's incentive structure strongly suggests this plateau will last a while
5277 2018-08-10 19:51:00 Generally the bar is very low, just the lines are very long and the legal process very slow. 
Sort of like getting a CDL requires English but testing can be done in Spanish.  I doubt anyone has been deported for not knowing or learning English.
5278 2018-08-10 19:50:14 And vegetable oil is generally used. The difference in procedure results in the different texture of batter between two. As for cupcakes, emulsion is very important and flour is mixed in the batter until smooth. But when making muffin, all the ingredients are roughly mixed.
5279 2018-08-10 19:50:10 oil change, tire rotation & full tank must feel to my car like a mani and pedi feel to me . Gotta keep my baby on point

5283 2018-08-10 19:49:48 It matters as the oil gas etc. under it is split differently if lake rather than sea (or sea rather than lake).
5284 2018-08-10 19:49:46 Because they NEED OIL...   Let rise the price of FOOD in CHINA and see what happens.
5285 2018-08-10 19:49:41 Oil for immigration!! In 1975 is er een handtekening gezet onder een akkoord. Alles zal gefaciliteerd worden in ruil voor olie. Daar plukken we nu de wrange vruchten van en de regering staat met de rug tegen de muur. Ze gaan/kunnen niks doen....

5288 2018-08-10 19:48:55 all justincould do is ban oil imports. That would hurt rhe east and possible help the west. Can't have that
5289 2018-08-10 19:48:54 My signature bar is a saguaro soap and I use saguaro seeds in it and add agave and aloe and color it with spirulina, it has fragrance oil called ancient sedona that smells like the desert after a long rain.

5296 2018-08-10 19:48:18 Canada consumes over one million { plus }  barrels of oil each  day , a refinery that produces 300,000  barrels a day would cost 5 billion plus - and  take  7  years  to  build , then  you  need  to  distribute the  finished  product , getting  a  little  complicated ,and pricey

5299 2018-08-10 19:47:51 We infuse oil with rosemary and garlic before roasting then add them back on once done so they don't burn. Had with meatballs and tomato sauce. Not an obvious combo but rather good! Tbh I'm a huge fan of eggs on toast too.
5300 2018-08-10 19:47:51 5k pere for beard balm. No beard oil yet.
5301 2018-08-10 19:47:26 The oil prices wouldn’t have affected them nearly as much had they not taken centralized control of the economy and tried to fix commodities prices. Had they left the market free, the country would have adjusted far better.
5302 2018-08-10 19:47:15 Philip Shabecoff – constitute yet another exaggerated Malthusian  scare,  joining those of the population bomb (Paul Ehrlich), resource   exhaustion (Club of Rome), Peak Oil (M. King Hubbert), and global   cooling (John Holdren).”
5303 2018-08-10 19:47:02 LOL!!! You just said you’d prefer to get oil from Venezuela. Heavy oil, pipelines, shipping. Guess if the oil comes from a socialist hellhole it’s A-OK for the environment!
5304 2018-08-10 19:46:57 Nominal avg hourly wages are up 2.7%,a function of results generated in current times, Inflation is ticking up-impacted by multiple factors,an expanding economy,Pres Obama did not enjoy much,oil prices,which Pres Obama benefited from supply glut price decreases.Tariffs a problem.

5307 2018-08-10 19:46:47 Not the deregulation of the mortgage market, the price of oil, Anthony Barber’s consumer credit boom going bust etc, etc then?
5308 2018-08-10 19:46:36 If i'm nuts and a conspiracy theorist, you simply need to do some research, look at how badly Aramco was doing before the Iraq war, i don't want oil at the expense of children being beheaded/blown up thank you, i would rather have clean energy the beasts are destroying our planet

5314 2018-08-10 19:45:46 Since when is oil "clean"?  You're a strange guy Andy.
5315 2018-08-10 19:45:45 My oil change is at almost $200! I literally have no idea what my car actually needs! I just say yes to everything 
5316 2018-08-10 19:45:42 Wherever you pop up with your oil shill message, Kleer will follow. California is a zero-emission leader (BEV & FCEV). Fossil fuel's days are numbered.
5317 2018-08-10 19:45:39 Look the guy is doing good for this planet electric cars so we dont rely on the oil companies. In whos interest is it to destroy tesla hmmmmm the corrupt barrons
5318 2018-08-10 19:45:38 It was just chicken bones with some salt, pepper and olive oil added afterwards. I did reduce it down though....which makes the flavour more intense.

5325 2018-08-10 19:45:00 She happily obtains the kitchen utensil and heads back over before scanning the back of the box for the other wet ingredients. “1/3 cup of water and 1/3 cup of oil. That shouldn’t be too hard!”
She goes to the cabinets to obtain a measuring cup but soon encounters her lifelong -

5333 2018-08-10 19:44:25 The Creamy Baby Oil with Aloe Vera & Vitamin E has not been tested/approved for use as a Mosquito Repellent, but it was discontinued briefly, which could explain why the products you've been seeing were at a higher price. It should be available again at affordable prices ASAP!
5334 2018-08-10 19:44:23 Gotta keep the place nice to get the oil people in there

5337 2018-08-10 19:43:55 available to the public - There is no THC so there's no high associated with it. It's not cheap, $65 for an 8 ounce bottle. They also sell salve and tincture oil.

5339 2018-08-10 19:43:46 Seems SUPER self-indulgent to like-and-reply to this RT, but I made them last night with rosemary from the garden, topped them on the Roasted Tomato Sauce (yes, duh, with olive oil roasted tomatoes) and just kept going “oh my GOD” with a weird  “???” of disbelief.
5340 2018-08-10 19:43:44 Has Zero to do with who invested, it’s because of the size of holding. GM, VW, Toyota, large oil, Everyone knows that a major player has just backed Tesla.
5341 2018-08-10 19:43:18 Make sure you use pure Argan oil. I know a girl who uses coconut oil and her lashes grew. I once used a lash growing serum, since then I have terrible problems with one eye and the Optometrist doesn't know why.
5342 2018-08-10 19:43:05 I agree, it's the same logic sometimes applied to Palm Oil, assuming that all palm oil is bad....
5343 2018-08-10 19:43:04 Opposition is based on refutable & unproven science.  You would claim the science is “settled”  but couldn’t provide proof.   Projects like EE have  multidecade economic timeframes.   day’s oil price is not the deciding factor.   let’s just keep buying oil f/ foreign dictators.
5344 2018-08-10 19:42:58 But you still claim your cancer was cured by cannabis oil, and not by the actual medical procedures you undertook?
5345 2018-08-10 19:42:56 Seeing what Bezos is getting away with re anti-trust were JD Rockefeller still with us he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell government "make my day, punks"
5346 2018-08-10 19:42:33 @CamWesthead any comment on your boss @theJagmeetSingh stance on preferring foreign oil to domestic?
5347 2018-08-10 19:42:22 the amount of olive oil i inhale daily is horrifying.
5348 2018-08-10 19:42:16 Has anyone tried CBD oil for chronic pain - oral or vape? Did it help?

5351 2018-08-10 19:41:50 @realDonaldTrump BREAKING:  China has just announced 25% tariffs on $16 billion worth of US goods.  They are targeting Oil and Automobiles the most.  

This is a major loss for the US auto industry.  

Rememeber this in November, because it's 100% Trump's fault.
5352 2018-08-10 19:41:35 Absolutely, kubernetes, is extra cost, time and distractions from development productivity and business logic which generates revenue. No one learning to drive needs to know about oil change and gear systems, just steering wheels, brakes and gas pedal.
5353 2018-08-10 19:41:34 The cashier said “wow you must have one spoiled boyfriend” bc I bought Riley new clothes today but really I’m just tired of oil stained shirts, and greased stained pants 
5354 2018-08-10 19:41:28 Now. But are we when oil is $39/bbl??? Our fracking fields aren't profitable at those levels, the Saudis oil is.
5355 2018-08-10 19:41:20 To my ladies that cook, can butter always be used as a substitute to oil? With anything?
5356 2018-08-10 19:41:18 Enjoy your #moments....#mistsoftime offer amusing outcomes in the #business- no names. Much fuss about the #gold and #oil price to follow and let us not forget the silly notion of #tarriffing China!! La!
5357 2018-08-10 19:41:09 Very nice, very nice. I was going to suggest grabbing some mozzarella cheese sticks (in the string cheese section), wash them in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs, then super heated oil for about 30-40 seconds.
5358 2018-08-10 19:41:04 A KING, WTF???? I NEED TO GET SOME COCONUT OIL I WANNA GLOW.
5359 2018-08-10 19:40:50 There is a spray you can use on hot spot areas to cool the skin and keep it from itching, if Max has bare areas. It is called Vetericyn. Also you can add a capful of canola oil or get some fish oil and add a little bit to Max’s food once per day. Good luck with it all!

5364 2018-08-10 19:40:00 We could have done the same thing with Saudi oil if Stunned Wonder down east had let the pipeline be built.

5366 2018-08-10 19:39:53 I ended up picking up around the den, cleaning off the kitchen counters, washing the bed comforter, cooking lunch, and refilling my olive oil. 

....That's rest, right?

5373 2018-08-10 19:39:10 40.) The next financial crisis is coming - and it is likely to be clearly worse than last time. In a nightmare scenario, it is now a toxic blend of trade war and inflated corporate loans, dollar bills and oil prices,
5374 2018-08-10 19:38:54 As we both know this issue is a lawyers dream. No matter what is passed there will always be winners and losers. Focus on losers inhibits passage of any reforms, seeking the perfect solution where nobody loses.

5376 2018-08-10 19:38:43 I have to say, steamed asparagus (the way mom made it growing up)? Terrible. Grilled or roasted asparagus (esp if you throw some olive oil and parmesan cheese on there). SO DELICIOUS.
5377 2018-08-10 19:38:38 Not necessarily. Since Saudi are able to manipulate oil price all that’s needed is info on what and when, and a hedge fund of choice could place the bet beforehand. Thats how you transfer money without crossing borders.
5378 2018-08-10 19:38:37 Oil prices will go up with sanctions against buying Iranian oil, unless China & the EU step up to maintain trade and relations. The anti-Obama/hateful repudiation of the Iran Nuclear Agreement is as stupid as pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord.
5379 2018-08-10 19:38:37 Please don't insult our intelligence... @theJagmeetSingh CLEARLY stated that we should be looking at building refineries to process our oil HERE! Not send our resources elsewhere. He advocated MADE IN CANADA solutions. Your misinformation is blatant partisanship!

5384 2018-08-10 19:38:06 Business isnt governance. You sell your rights too cheaply to @realDonaldTrump if you think a snake oil saleman has your interests at heart. He is the Plutocracy and will sell your rights for his gain without hesitation. In fact, he is selling your rights away right now.
5385 2018-08-10 19:38:06 Alberta is phasing out coal, has a carbon tax, effiency initiatives, and has a cap on oilsands GHG emissions. No other oil producing region has these. Alberta should be the supplier of choice for environmentalists during the transition.
5386 2018-08-10 19:37:57 The windmills are destroying our views but the oil drilling rig isn’t. I couldn’t even make it past the 1st paragraph.
5387 2018-08-10 19:37:56 It’s a fact.
Energy East was never intended to provide Alberta oil to Central Canada. It was for foreign sales. 

Like always. 

Too bad all the pipelines in Alberta were built due south eh?

5391 2018-08-10 19:37:29 So far it feels too hard to keep it in a solid form. I guess coconut oil melts at 76°, but even in my office at 68° it's getting all liquidy. Think I'll look for a Shea butter one this weekend.
5392 2018-08-10 19:37:15 Generally, people can't use Medicare and Social security unless they've paid into it for at least 10 years.  Usually parents would not be net burdens on treasury-in many cases they either rely on own family for support or have their own retirement funds that they spend here.
5393 2018-08-10 19:37:12 OK, it had some oil. I can see it dripping off the bottom of the block. Doesn't matter much. That engine is scrap iron now.
5394 2018-08-10 19:37:04 I don't support the idea of taxing churches 

But let your political affiliation blind you to tell me Jesus paid tax.

Even the much chastised 'incompetent' Mahama never thought of lazily taxing churches, i.e. when world commodity prices like cocoa, oil and gold fell badly.

5400 2018-08-10 19:36:44 It may seem like a counter-intuitive combination, but it has happened, most notably in the 1970s following a period of political turbulence resulting in the resignation of Richard Nixon, oil supply shocks, and price controls.
5401 2018-08-10 19:36:38 this woman I just met started going OFF when I decided to converse with her. She was telling me how she loves her black castor oil and how she used wonder why my peoples palms don’t match our bodies. All while her best friend played A Milli and Nicki Minaj on the aux..
5402 2018-08-10 19:36:37 I would indeed eat a lot less meat if I had to slaughter it all myself.

5404 2018-08-10 19:36:09 The U.S. has been on the wrong side in the Middle East for decades. Saudi oil and the regime's willingness to cut great deals with American oil companies led this country to back the more extreme Sunni Muslim countries rather than the more moderate Shi'a.
5405 2018-08-10 19:36:08 All your Irish Oil reserves will run out next year.

You may not get that Space Port too!

5406 2018-08-10 19:36:01 Let's deal with facts, dude.   This is part of the NEB application. 
Energy East
Energy East was a 4,500-kilometre pipeline proposed to carry 1.1 million barrels of crude oil per day from Alberta and Saskatchewan to refineries in Eastern Canada.
5407 2018-08-10 19:35:58 Not in the article; 2 were built in Finland and are destined for duty in the St Laurence, the third was built in the southern US (big dude) and will be used in the Arctic.  They were originally destined for oil exploration in the Beaufort, but when that fell through Davie ....
5408 2018-08-10 19:35:57 Unfortunately it is precisely the presence of that “...pool of oil in a democracy “ which causes all the trouble including the ending of any pretence of being a democracy.
5409 2018-08-10 19:35:43 They are weakening every country please check the oil companies, they want all the nice decent muslims to have no where to turn, no funds, so they join their sect that no muslim even likes, they force them Though IS is an Islamic movement, its roots are in Wahhabism, #WAKEUPALL
5410 2018-08-10 19:35:38 Temporary U.S.$ strength is part of the explanation but also the £2T debt coupled with Brexit are two chickens coming home to roost. The swagger, cowardice and bravado can only go on for so long. They need our oil, water and electricity generating capacity, without it, its over.
5411 2018-08-10 19:35:22 Mmmmm, a coat of motor oil
5412 2018-08-10 19:35:20 Oil producers in Alberta and Saskatchewan can sell their oil to whomever they want to sell to. Canadian refineries can buy oil from whomever they want. Just not Saudi Arabia. It makes no difference where from for either party.
5413 2018-08-10 19:35:18 I don't think many would Characterize climate models as "simple". Regardless, if your believe in Climate Change (which I do) a pipeline in Canada will not impact world demand. In fact, TMEP reduces greenhouse emissions as it gets oil off of train tracks.

5416 2018-08-10 19:35:02 Fun F1 fact for my followers, a few years ago there was a f1 driver funded by Venezuelan state oil, Pastor Maldonado. He was reportedly a friend of Chavez, and while he had a reputation for bad luck and aggressive driving he scored the last win for Williams Racing in a decade.

5427 2018-08-10 19:33:09 It might be a great idea to close that based and remove all Americans if it is that dangerous. It is a shame our relations have gotten so sad with Muslims. Our attitude on Islam didn't help. If they haven't added oil refinery areas they might not go far.

They are old, not contributors and likely to use Medicare ect. Rather than pointing to implied hypocrisy and keeping it, makes a very good case for abolishing it.
5438 2018-08-10 19:31:37 In Italy there were always bottles of olive oil and bottles of vinegar on the tables.

Rather than doubling down on oil (which we know we cannot do forever) we should be investing in other forms of energy generation... no reason for govt's not to do so.

5462 2018-08-10 19:29:47 Frankincense oil works better than most of my acne prescriptions and that’s a fact
5463 2018-08-10 19:29:44 I rub my steaks with olive oil
5464 2018-08-10 19:29:31 Jamican black castor oil
5465 2018-08-10 19:29:31 Which fuel is used? Raw oil?
5466 2018-08-10 19:29:19 Don’t need go that far back look at recent history. Then again having all that oil and not being able to ship it anywhere is also nice. We have refineries most are now mothball and cost too much to upgrade and then all those environmentalists would go nuts.
5467 2018-08-10 19:29:02 u old na go oil them or something
5468 2018-08-10 19:29:01 What President Traump does not know about the changing patterns of international oil market and very unfortunately, his advisers,some of whom are known to me,did not explain to him is that time has changed and absence of  Iran’s oil from market can fundamentally affect oil market
5469 2018-08-10 19:28:59 I've often thought that. Building those refineries would have seen Alberta through some rough times in the 80s when oil crashed. By now we would be independent of foreign oil and likely have a national Heritage Fund to rival Norway's. <sigh>
5470 2018-08-10 19:28:51 As i Said these organizations are exist only to lobby for very particular interest mostly military industrial complex oil corporations etc
5471 2018-08-10 19:28:45 I am discovering the hard way all the nuances of how it breaks down your dental health. I do oil pulling with coconut oil quite often. A friend who has all his teeth and great teeth, has now lost 2 molars in 2 mths. He has blood cancer, his immune system is breaking down.
5472 2018-08-10 19:28:32 He(Tedi) has been a sneak oil sales man , He suppose to submit all the collected money for deceased wife !!!

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
5474 2018-08-10 19:28:25 How about we use our own oil. We don’t need to buy it from anyone.
5475 2018-08-10 19:28:25 keep on dreaming until the oil revenues will fall.
5476 2018-08-10 19:28:23 You mean George who helped gas the Kurds and cover it up and stole oil and aid that should been the Iraqi people's? That George?

Cool story.
5477 2018-08-10 19:28:21 Yum! Have you tried these w/o oil and/or an oil substitute?
5478 2018-08-10 19:28:20 Go and wash your head with anoiting oil
5479 2018-08-10 19:28:12 Diluted peppermint oil on the forehead. Works for even migraines.
5480 2018-08-10 19:28:04 If I got an oil diffuser for my office is that extra?
5481 2018-08-10 19:27:56 Black people have separate jars of coconut oil for the bathroom & the kitchen
5482 2018-08-10 19:27:55 Fun fact the best lube ever is coconut oil   I didn’t know.
5483 2018-08-10 19:27:52 That sounds like an issue to be addressed in production practices and has nothing to do with oil poisoning our world.

5486 2018-08-10 19:27:42 You can definitely tell the weather has changed. My coconut oil has solidified. #rain #endofheatwaveblues
5487 2018-08-10 19:27:42 I been going to the twins so long they did my oil change for free today 
5488 2018-08-10 19:27:41 Mr. President please do something against Venezuela it's citizen are leaving in tens of thousands everyday there's no good no meds no services of any kind the regime takes all the oil income and subsidized their lavish lifestyle and help terrorist groups and communist countries
5489 2018-08-10 19:27:32 Nope. I do not support Saudi oil at all... not really a fan of anything to do with Saudi Arabia, to be honest.
5490 2018-08-10 19:27:26 Hey! We don’t want “you know who” to know we still have oil. 

If any billionaire dictators ask: we say we have no oil and already have freedom 
5491 2018-08-10 19:27:25 Car at work runs out of gas. Where's the gas contsiner? Find it. It's empty. Gotta fill the container to fill the car. Where's the loner car to get to the gas station? It's getting an oil change.  4 sweaty work hours 'til the weekend.
5492 2018-08-10 19:27:20 Ladies Just Because That Lipstick Is Expensive Doesn't Mean It Looks Good On Your Lips Some Lips Just Need Vaseline and olive oil

5494 2018-08-10 19:27:15 Scotland is not a poor country. Far from it. We have a strong export market, renewable energy, tourism, oil and gas, technology to name a few. Your credible sources are not worth arguing about. We as a people are INFORMED.
5495 2018-08-10 19:27:09 Colbert and Tomlin are 2018 snake oil salesmen.  This stretch of Steelers defense is the worst defense the Steelers have fielded in the last 45 + years.  There's average to slightly above average players sprinkled in, but for the most part, poor for the last 7 years

5499 2018-08-10 19:26:34 How can the rights off women be worth any amount of money. I believe women are equal and it’s not right to treat them with indignity. Shame on all you people that try to make it about oil and maple syrup.
5500 2018-08-10 19:26:21 This is crazy, they would save more money if they just put the oil in bags and then put it on a big train.
5501 2018-08-10 19:26:19 Why is it that Google Maps does not show Antarctica? Google Maps show everywhere on Earth but not Antarctica= Very odd!!!=What is it that "powers" dont want us to see or know about=Oil Drilling??? Whats going on down there???

5504 2018-08-10 19:26:07 Thank you, Jeff! Wishing you the best on your new endeavors!! Always appreciated your work with the Oil! Hope you're summer has been great! Appreciate the message!
5505 2018-08-10 19:25:55 Any car dealers in southern WV want to make me a deal on my new car. Car must be bulletproof, no breakdowns, no repairs, no oil changes or maintenance required.
5506 2018-08-10 19:25:54 Maybe there’s space oil?
5507 2018-08-10 19:25:44 These next 3 days, please mama, let it be smooth. Fuck the sleep! I’ll sleep when I’m dead. But please let everything be smooth like olive oil.
5508 2018-08-10 19:25:42 Out of curiosity, what does England have which makes it so rich (apparently it subsidises us) whilst Scotland with oil, whisky/ fishing/ food, abundant renewable potential and educated workforce but is uniquely incapable of being solvent or successful?
5509 2018-08-10 19:25:39 OMG the bees for baby oil, wait till I imagine and I will get back to you 
5510 2018-08-10 19:25:37 OMG I LOVE OIL MONEY SO MUCH
5511 2018-08-10 19:25:34 If Canada was cut off from oil everyone in it would be dead within 2 months. Most killed by other people within the first 3 weeks trying to stave off starvation and exposure.
5512 2018-08-10 19:25:32 استغفر الله واتوب اليه.
5513 2018-08-10 19:25:24 Trump likes the Saudis so much because of the Money and the oil.
So he sells them arms to kill bus loads of children!
16 of the 18 men who were responsible for 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia.
LET ALL OF THIS SINK IN MY FRIENDS.
5514 2018-08-10 19:25:15 No more oil from Saudi Arabia. Than they can’t afford it anymore to fly these cars to their holiday destination.
5515 2018-08-10 19:25:13 Legally binding does not mean much. About as much as requiring English, paying back taxes ect.  
Nobody is deported for not learning English or just being poor. From my understanding and logically, extended family is being targeted, not parents or siblings
5516 2018-08-10 19:25:07 I’ll dead lotion and oil everything not my feet. Hate shoes and hate sliding across my floors.

5519 2018-08-10 19:24:42 Depends pd fungsi day cream tu mcm mana. If as moisturizer, tak payah pakai moisturizer lg. If as makeup base, pakai after moisturizer & sunscreen.

Face oil tengok jenis. Kalau dry oil eg. Rosehip, boleh pakai before moisturizer. Tp kalau nk pakai after moisturizer pun boleh je.
5520 2018-08-10 19:24:42 That's not weird. I've had my bike for yrs and she and I have been through a lot. Many fond memories and many fond miles. Won't trade her for the world.If she leaks a little oil it's as if she's bleeding. Hell, she's in better shape than I am. Wow, maybe I need help. LOL
5521 2018-08-10 19:24:41 Appreciating how in tune my car and I are. 

We need oil
5522 2018-08-10 19:24:39 Yes and this blonde Scot was using oil when sunbathing in June
5523 2018-08-10 19:24:34 If the claims of the oil reserves are true then we are going to need Reham. We don't have the machinery and expertise to drill ~5000 feet under deepwater. She amazed everyone by stooping so low.

5527 2018-08-10 19:24:04 We have a lot of mentally ill people, and people who are borderline. It's a shame the Rightwing preys upon them the same way TVangelicals sell their snake oil to elderly and poor people.
5528 2018-08-10 19:23:54 Having a pretty productive Friday...Worked half a day, vacuumed my car, cleaning my house, about to take a shower, get gas, get an oil change and pay my car payment...#Adulting

5533 2018-08-10 19:23:37 Using coconut oil in my hair is my new favourite thing 
5534 2018-08-10 19:23:35 Canada has a complex economy. Canada exports and imports vast quantities of oil and gas products just like every other commodity in a complex economy. If Canada for some reason, decided to embargo all oil imports, Canada would still have more than enough processing capacity.
5535 2018-08-10 19:23:35 Looks like consistent root development to me not just down tine holes. That trick is so unimpressive. Far too much snake oil being sold to clubs at massive profit! Good soil management negates the need. #respect
5536 2018-08-10 19:23:30 He speaks for very few people most of us want to use our own Oil.  Quebec wants to use foreign oil they can leave Canada 
5537 2018-08-10 19:23:15 And there's not a single Trump supporter that will admit to being duped by a snake oil salesman.
5538 2018-08-10 19:23:13 How much baby oil would that monster need?

- Brown Sugar + Olive oil = For Itchy Scalps 

- Apple Vinger + Lemon  = For Oily Hair 

- Egg  + Coconut = Hair Repair
5541 2018-08-10 19:22:31 People please don’t forget that Irving Refineries, the only refinery in Eastern Canada, have publicly said that even if Canadian oil made it to the East Coast they would continue to buy from their Middle East providers.  Jason do you remember that little factoid?
5542 2018-08-10 19:22:20 Baby oil use a Qtip they gonna just start sliding off
5543 2018-08-10 19:22:12 Eighth grade science teacher told me that I wouldn’t do well on the science project b/c I was book-smart and not creative. Proceeded to design experiment to clean up oil spills. Got an A, pursued a career in geology and specialized in hydrocarbon cleanup for a while.

5551 2018-08-10 19:21:28 Ay, I never said I was better than Elwood. Everyone knows that Da Vinci is the Elwood of oil painting.

5553 2018-08-10 19:21:14 Huge props to Tsitsipas for not going quietly. His level dropped after getting out to a quick start and Zverev kicked it up two or three notches but he didn't throw in the towel  #RogerCup
5554 2018-08-10 19:21:13 That is true but my point is that energy should be booming right now but it is crawling comparing to US. US oil & gas is picking up at exponential rates hiring full time, while we laying off. Savanna and Ensign moving rigs to US because we don't have enough drilling jobs.
5555 2018-08-10 19:20:57 Perhaps before pakai makeup malam tu jangan pakai cleanser dulu ? Cukup sekadar guna micellar water atau oil cleanser. After setel semua, nak tidur tu baru double cleanse.

5561 2018-08-10 19:20:26 @SuperdrugHelp would any store be willing to exchange anything if you dont have a receipt? I bought some shower foam that I didnt realise contains almond oil (which I am allergic to) until I got them home .
5562 2018-08-10 19:20:22 photogenic and me go together like oil an water
5563 2018-08-10 19:20:20 Yup. I read the Energy East project documents. Lots of money to upgrade the port and none to upgrade the refinery. It was all about getting oil onto tankers for export.
5564 2018-08-10 19:20:17 Just makes me reach for my coconut oil. 
5565 2018-08-10 19:20:11 Not really...  Good try though oil is plentiful in Abu Dhabi no worries just keep expanding the city football empire worldwide

5570 2018-08-10 19:19:49 That explains a lot. I guess the handle @ Snake Oil was taken.
5571 2018-08-10 19:19:32 The free market is a myth. Opposition is based on credible science. Hardly radical.

EE was only barely economical before he US shale oil boom and when oil was over $100
5572 2018-08-10 19:19:30 I would  say, Make- My- Day.  Get the  popcorn out. Turkey kicks the US army out, Iran blocks the Suez,  Oil shipments from All countries blocked. EU at the World Court, Winning!
5573 2018-08-10 19:19:21 Taking fish oil? Good for migraines, too.
5574 2018-08-10 19:19:18 Let's see if I have this right - you're saying that as we use fossils and everyone else uses renewables, there will be a glut of oil reserves that'll bring down the price of gas.
Win win.

5578 2018-08-10 19:18:57 Whenever I buy motor oil
And the clerk asks me if I need anything else , I often say “Yes, two straws”
And we both laugh and I get the “John Razzamatazz Kensil joke discount” 
( which is usually a moist towelette)
5579 2018-08-10 19:18:54 But wouldn't it be crazy for oil to be imported and exported from the same terminal? What's the business sense in that?
5580 2018-08-10 19:18:49 but they gots all the #oil!
5581 2018-08-10 19:18:34 if anything people like Lorenzo Mendoza, the billionaire owner of Polar (the country's near-monopoly supplier of basic goods like flour + oil, basically the Venezuelan equivalent of Kroger) are responsible for the shortages. the goods are there, they're just unaffordable
5582 2018-08-10 19:18:32 Not gonna lie. I was very close to being sprayed with hot oil as I'm panicking to unhook the tractor. Couldn't for the life of me pull the pin so I aborted mission. #imgonnamissher

5585 2018-08-10 19:18:05 Subscribing to one of those monthly man boxes where they give you like a plank of wood, some body spray, linseed oil, and a gun all sealed in a fuckin chest that has the word "Sir" burned into the wood.
5586 2018-08-10 19:18:02 Plot twist: I'm actually not allergic to Chicken, Egg or Shrimp, I'm actually allergic to the oil used to fry them

That'd fucking explain everything LMAO
5587 2018-08-10 19:18:00 Thats what I do - but had to up my fats to the point where I was drinking olive oil with Keto + time restrict. Cheat on weekends (no keto) Not gonna lie - Im addicted to the cerebral energy and focus. Have a hard time sleeping some nights (CBD THC helps lol)

5597 2018-08-10 19:16:24 You will literally wake up with the most amazing glow. And also make sure you know how to apply it. You just put a few drops in your hands rub it together and then pat your face. Do not rub it into your face. It breaks the oil particles.
5598 2018-08-10 19:16:13 ALL of the pipelines have the goal of "getting our oil to tidewater". That means getting the oil onto a tanker to be shipped by ocean to a foreign country. It means increased tanker traffic in our oceans.

Only 1 new refinery has been built in 30 years. Sturgeon, near Edmonton.
5599 2018-08-10 19:16:13 the 8 BMM for oil!!!
5600 2018-08-10 19:16:08 Yes.
There is misplaced nostalgia in the India - Russia relations.
From Sistema to going back on promises to award India oil fields to the jacked up prices for Admiral Gorshkov to Mig 29K to going back on cryogenic rockets...
There is a long list.
5601 2018-08-10 19:15:50 I'm so hyped right now I just got oil for my car and  2 week's worth of shirts and underwear and socks.... This is living
5602 2018-08-10 19:15:47 Check your Engine oil this morning.
5603 2018-08-10 19:15:45 This is the time politically to advocate for Canadian energy self-sufficiency and build the Energy East pipeline to use our own cheaper oil and support Canadian jobs.  We have many favourable arguments to support Canadian energy self-sufficiency.
5604 2018-08-10 19:15:40 Reflexiones de hoy con el Ing. Jaramillo,  "el olvido es algo maravilloso"
5605 2018-08-10 19:15:39 If we start calling ourselves the east then the east will accept our oil. Seems as the only want to do business with the east even if it's middle east not even far left east.
5606 2018-08-10 19:15:38 Very tanning oil smells like soy sauce
5607 2018-08-10 19:15:37 So, It was intended just for conventional Canadian oil then? (I mean, otherwise there seems not much point in proposing it.)
5608 2018-08-10 19:15:34 How Our CBD Products Work
At CTFO, our CBD products utilize the full spectrum Cannabis plant mixed with Hemp Seed oil. Not all hemp is created equal. Our CBD Oil is made from NON-GMO, PESTICIDE FREE, CO2 Extracted Hemp Oil using only organic ingredients.
5609 2018-08-10 19:15:32  you so 
 fuckin' 
 precious 
 when you 
 smile 
5610 2018-08-10 19:15:32 Let's see trump with NK. And Harper let Putin have it on person with regard to the Ukraine well before Obama spoke up.  Canadians in the east can enjoy their blood oil when they fill up at the pump.
5611 2018-08-10 19:15:20 Haha I did, a couple times. I've tried warm and cold compresses, magnesium oil, iron supplements and other things. Nothing seems to work but getting out of bed at 12PM and going for a walk.
5612 2018-08-10 19:15:18 My next question is if Jagmeet helps Horgan kill the Trans Mountain Pipeline will he lobby for Saudi oil imports to the West Coast ;)
5613 2018-08-10 19:15:15 I know it we have been getting plenty in Southside they all just slide right north the Oil Trough/Rosie area.
5614 2018-08-10 19:15:12 Keeping short positions in OSEBX open. So many markets are ripe for major reversals (gold, $, stocks, oil)
5615 2018-08-10 19:15:09 That was the plan of the USA to build a US(opic) in oats, barley & wheat and stave them also open another front with contracts of oil production thereby reducing their ability to act in their own interests
That's why US stopped Mexico from joining but allowed OPIC prices in USD
5616 2018-08-10 19:15:02 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. Psalm 45:7 #CBNGoodNews
5617 2018-08-10 19:14:46 tbh I think coconut oil is the best thing that’s ever happened to me
5618 2018-08-10 19:14:39 We Canadians need to shut up the 3 thousand people that have no jobs and protest for a living. These people collect funds from US entities. That's why our oil is at a discount. We are getting ripped off by the US.
5619 2018-08-10 19:14:39 Gen off, If nepa did this I'm sure I'll give them Epe... Oil 
5620 2018-08-10 19:14:30 Haulers are coming in for tonight's Lucas Oil/East Coast Truck and Tractor Pulls. Don't let the unpredictable weather scare you away, the track crew will do their best to put on the show tonight. Pulls starts at 7:00 pm. Hope to see you tonight at the fair!
5621 2018-08-10 19:14:24 EPA Retreats on Trump Campaign Promise. Costly Ozone Regulations Will Continue.TRUMP DEREGULATION OF OIL REFINERIES ARE DOING LOTS OF HARM TO U.S..OUR AIR IS PURE POISON.

5623 2018-08-10 19:13:59 I’d say give the ordinary a go, the cold pressed rose hip oil they do really improved my skin!! Otherwise def go to the doctors about it and see what they can do x
5624 2018-08-10 19:13:55 After having buyers remorse from getting the mechanical package from the dealership paying an extra $50 a month on my bill. I don’t regret it all now going in for a oil change and tire rotation. A bill that would have been $170 came out to $0!
5625 2018-08-10 19:13:48 Ain't nuthing a little Black Seed Oil and Apple Cider Vinegar can't fix
5626 2018-08-10 19:13:42 let me rephrase that. the fact that tesla is obligated by being public to show the numbers will be the best tool against FUD. if you take that of the equation it will be a win to other automakers, to oil industry to everyone except tesla. tesla will be shooting itself in the foot
5627 2018-08-10 19:13:41 The Energy East pipeline is needed NOW but JT saw fit to royally F--k that up and now unless we toss his sorry a$$ out next year Energy East will never see  see the light of day and we will still use/import oil from as DT said SH-T hole countries
5628 2018-08-10 19:13:40 Too many "sh*t-hole" countries there to concern Trump, no matter how much oil, coal, gold, silver, platinum, diamonds...
5629 2018-08-10 19:13:36 The reason the recovering isn't being felt as strongly is that the oil patch has found ways to operate with much less Alberta labour. They automated their trucks and rigs and outsourced engineering and geologist jobs overseas.
5630 2018-08-10 19:13:33 i just lost a brand new ass tea tree oil wtf
5631 2018-08-10 19:12:56 So underrated Rapeseed oil
5632 2018-08-10 19:12:38 When you 2K over your oil change. Oops...
5633 2018-08-10 19:12:29 No such thing as too much basil.
Roughly cube some tomatoes and mozarrella, tear up a couple of handfuls of basil, and make a salad. Dress with extra virgin olive oil and the nicest balsamic vinegar you have.
5634 2018-08-10 19:12:27 There are so many variables to consider in this refine vs export debate, but left-leaners are completely disingenuous relative to Cda's energy self sufficiency. Truth? JT killed EE, refineries can re-tool for heavy oil & we are foolish if we don't cut off blood oil from despots.
5635 2018-08-10 19:12:13 I really dont like bringing my car to get an oil change. Its so boring sitting here waiting
5636 2018-08-10 19:12:08 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5637 2018-08-10 19:12:05 Make racism great again. Bring back beautiful clean asbestos. Make the bald eagle the official bird for Thanksgiving dinner. Dig for ore and oil in  the Grand Canyon and Yosemite.
5638 2018-08-10 19:11:45 Okay well if you go left we can be a mirror I’ll forgive you
I mean, piercers day stay away from tea tree oil I think but I swear by the stuff. As long as you only use it when things are getting gross/bad I think it’s a GODSENT
5639 2018-08-10 19:11:43 The DMV fucking sucks dude. I don't think I'm getting an oil change today
5640 2018-08-10 19:11:36 Terence, unless you are blind. One  State university at first. 8 today with 2 anglo saxon universities within which you have 2 faculties of medicine. Dr,  you come very early. Others come timely. No link with oil. Cameroon evolves thanks to Biya.#StopHateSpeech #StopFakeNews
5641 2018-08-10 19:11:27 And those numbers don't include the self-employed contractors. The numbers of lost jobs must be in the 100s of thousands. Everywhere I go I hear the same story. 
But let's import oil. Bloody commies.
5642 2018-08-10 19:11:13 I hate these oil field towns , they over price everything just legit paid 7$ for a salad they be finessing us 
5643 2018-08-10 19:11:00 Do you guys oil every part of your body?
5644 2018-08-10 19:10:56 I need to try that TJ oil
5645 2018-08-10 19:10:49 I just make one with olive oil, spring onions and chopped up pickled cucumber. Sometimes add a spritz of white wine vinegar too, maybe some mustard. I'm not a vegan but I kind-of like the dairy-free-ness of this version.
5646 2018-08-10 19:10:47 Weeeelllll yes, but if we would need access to our reliable energy supply through Energy East which @JustinTrudeau killed off. Ergo the reliance on oil from KSA, Nigeria, Algeria, etc. #cdnpoli
5647 2018-08-10 19:10:25 I CANT BELIEVE IVE NEVER TRIED TEA TREE OIL BEFORE hopefully if i don’t fiddle w it too much it won’t swell or anything but i def wanna get my nose but i’m debating left bc i have more piercings on my right side shsjjsj
5648 2018-08-10 19:10:22 I feel like every time I gotta do something pertaining to my car like wash it or get an oil change or something, it rains 
5649 2018-08-10 19:10:18 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

Trillions underground that has yet to be untapped! Stay in Iraq. Help Iraq grow their economy, Need advisers to show how

5663 2018-08-10 19:08:06 Unlike my industry  I work in oil, our entire industry is mostly very good at what we do and if you rely on us then everybody will still die 
5664 2018-08-10 19:08:04 What because we didn't stand behind them and go into Iraq? We all know what that was about right? Same reason why they won't back us now Oil. They should remember we have the 3rd largest oil reserves in the world so when we finally build refineries hope Canada remembers this!
5665 2018-08-10 19:07:52 I be so salty I can’t get the 19.99 oil change 
5666 2018-08-10 19:07:49 Day 9 of taking fish oil vitamins: I am starting to hear colors
5667 2018-08-10 19:07:47 I bet it smelled like shea and jojoba oil in there.
5668 2018-08-10 19:07:38 I got a keloid on my nose, but honestly they’re not that hard to get rid of! (TMI but) I was gross and picked it so I was certain it’d get worse (which it obvs did at the time) but tea tree oil works like a TREAT on that shit. I vote nose on the right side so we can match
5669 2018-08-10 19:07:26 Love going to get my oil changed then getting minor shit fixed for free
5670 2018-08-10 19:07:22 I expect to find sugar, milk, cream, eggs, and vanilla in vanilla ice cream. You know what I don’t expect to see? palm oil. (or E numbers and flavourings)
5671 2018-08-10 19:07:20 Was there any oil in the engine? Looks like there is bluing where the rod bearing was in the rod (top part). Usually the lube oil will keep the metal cool enough that it doesn't turn blue from the heat, even during a failure.
5672 2018-08-10 19:07:14 I've had worst jobs, to be honest. It was mostly shop work with more beeping, occasional petrol spillages and learning-by-osmosis about oil and tyre pressure. Double pay on bank holidays. Not bad.
5673 2018-08-10 19:07:12 My whole check is going to an oil change, insurance, and gas leaving me w about 30 bucks for the next two weeks :-)
5674 2018-08-10 19:07:11 three billion in loss trade is not significant plus Canada is not oil reliant so from that angle the gov't can afford to be lippy, but from the perspective of native treaty rights that still hang in legal limbo the gov't should eat crow

5682 2018-08-10 19:05:17 Yeah, for sure. I think it’s kind of akin to a detailed oil painting vs minimal painting. Anything w that much attention to detail is so amazing to look at. Both types of art can be really impactful, but it’s rarer that minimal stuff hits me the same way. Can be the same w film
5683 2018-08-10 19:04:57 @Grady @BigJoe1070 Drive downtown for that oil change I HAD to grab 2day... nope! Tried filling in Chicago concert tix... wife works at hospital all weekend, so no bueno.

5686 2018-08-10 19:04:38 Venezuela’s downfall was heavily tied to its over-reliance on its oil. And ACO has cited Scandinavian countries repeatedly, not Venezuela. You right-wingers need a new talking point.
5687 2018-08-10 19:04:22 That’s what I forgot on my grocery list....! Baby oil!   Thanks for the reminder...!! Lol.     oooooo.......ahhhhhhh.......
5688 2018-08-10 19:04:20 One way to immigrate *legally* is through the "Parents of US Citizens" category.  That's what her parents did. It requires the US sponsor (Melania) to submit legally binding financial guarantee, background checks. etc.  My point is Trump & Co. wants to eliminate that category.
5689 2018-08-10 19:04:20 I really like that oil from Lidl 
5690 2018-08-10 19:04:02 people really believe the military is fighting for our “freedom”  they’re “fighting” for oil. and by “fighting” they mean killing innocent civilians

5692 2018-08-10 19:03:50 Oil ends session higher, but posts sharp weekly tumble, underlining bumpy stretch for crude
5693 2018-08-10 19:03:41 Trump will make sure the markets in oil are calm until after the midterm elections....he will fool the people into believing that gas prices will not go up.
5694 2018-08-10 19:03:36 The numbers don't support your conclusion. The seven states without income taxes rank 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, 23rd, 35th, and 40th in per capita GDP. Alaska (4) is an outlier because of the oil revenue. Wyoming (7) and Texas (13) have seen per capita GDP drops in the last few years

5696 2018-08-10 19:03:29 I don't even have the condition you do and hair burns me. Gonna sound like a basic bitch but olive oil & coconut oil have been the most gentle and left my skin the softest when I shave with them^^

5711 2018-08-10 19:01:31 If Canada continues to but Saudi Oil then we are the problem. If we have issues with their human rights record but buy dirty oil that we can produce ourselves then i have zero sympathy. PMJT has no idea what he is doing with global relations.

5715 2018-08-10 19:01:05 Hi Nikki,  in order to destroy the drug industry,  one must first stop the exportation of the chemicals that are used in making them. Oil companies are selling the raw materials legally into those countries.

5720 2018-08-10 19:00:32 Not sure who’s “flocking”. Downtown YYC, where well-paying jobs reigned for 20+ years, remains a ghost town with 30% vacancy. Jobs have returned to the oil patch but wages are lower & lack of confidence in the industry & govt isn’t attracting workers to fill those jobs.

5730 2018-08-10 18:59:31 Humans have the technology and means to reverse this. Reduce CO2 emissions, reduce pollution, plant trees, re-establish wildlife populations etc. 

What down side is there from doing all of this apart from the impact on the wealth of the super rich and oil based corporations?
5731 2018-08-10 18:59:31 political dissidents? Is that what we call lunatics that rave about invented conspiracies as a vehicle to sell snake oil bullshit remedies to people who's parents were siblings? Nice try...

5735 2018-08-10 18:59:01 He's clearly saying any oil we bought from Saudi we can get elsewhere, out of context
5736 2018-08-10 18:59:01 If you notice it gets too dry, dry conditioning it with some shea butter or argan oil

5740 2018-08-10 18:58:31 For USA? That's the reason won't let us go, not quite the oil. Then for Britain? It's both our oil & brain that they're having sweaty leaking pants overnight because they'll become irrelevant in less than a year. Then to the rest of the Biafra enemies, those ones are #ImpsAsOne
5741 2018-08-10 18:58:28 We've had enough of self-serving grifters @DOIDepSec @SecretaryZinke You both refuse to do your job so get out of our @DOI. We don't want our taxpayers money used to destroy our public lands & slaughter wildlife/wildhorses for special interests oil, timber, toxic mining.
5742 2018-08-10 18:58:19 Looks like we need TWO pipelines. 

One running west to east for oil, the other one east to west for maple syrup. And everyone keeps their cash. LOL

5752 2018-08-10 18:57:03 That defines why he's the chairperson of a govt undertaking which is ONGC. His background gives him a 0 qualification in the field of oil refining and exploration. That's for the input @a_truthsayer

5754 2018-08-10 18:56:38 The sad thing is that no matter how mad they get and what assets they sell off. Canada will still buy their dirty oil which is despicable.

5759 2018-08-10 18:56:03 What an idiot. If he and others hadn’t opposed Energy East, oil from the prairies would meet the demand and keep the revenues in Canada
5760 2018-08-10 18:55:59 Brad, Trump + facts = oil and water.
He will only check what his brilliant mind develops as fact and spews out his pie hole.
5761 2018-08-10 18:55:57 Anything and CBD oil is a pretty rank combo tbh
5762 2018-08-10 18:55:51 my moms asked me if I want cbd oil; it’s a crazy time we’re in.
5763 2018-08-10 18:55:40 Yes you are right we may call IMF but  ask them if they need money or not we dont beg !!! We kicked IMF out remember we may not have oil wells or other natural resources but we do have dignity and honor which you dont have ..remember 15th july !!!! @ikalin1
5764 2018-08-10 18:55:40 But, to be honest, I wouldn't trust a state run oil company, especially if the top brass are all Tories.

5771 2018-08-10 18:54:53 I think my scalp is having an allergic reaction to this oil I bought. My edges are on fire 
5772 2018-08-10 18:54:49 Kenya is so lucky to be mining oil. However, compared to our closest neighbours in Uganda we are no better. Infact, petroleum commodities are cheaper in the landlocked country.

5773 2018-08-10 18:54:45 Norway didn't sell off the blocks to the private sector. They set up a national oil company: Statoil, which means that the majority of the profit goes into state coffers. UK gets tax receipts and the oil companies rake it in.

5775 2018-08-10 18:54:31 @KangriCarrier Basant Ji a lot of drivers of dumpers, trucks and buses use Kerosene oil in their vehicles without any check in Kishtwar region, please take care of it as well.
5776 2018-08-10 18:54:18 I took my acrylics off and it’s been the best decision! Just keep coconut or olive oil on them to make them grow faster and not look so thin and chipped.
5777 2018-08-10 18:54:17 Just burn down all palm oil plantations and give the land back to the people who actually need it...?
5778 2018-08-10 18:54:08 The coconut oil which is the disvirgined one?
5779 2018-08-10 18:54:05 Why can't we just Use. Our. Own. Oil?!

5787 2018-08-10 18:52:45 Peppermint oil as well!! Rub it against both sides of your temple to relax
5788 2018-08-10 18:52:20 Would you not love to hear the snake oil sales pitch for this bullshit?!?!! Notice how the artist used negative space to fill the canvas, saying more with silence, than he could with art.

5795 2018-08-10 18:51:40 Of course we will, we are an oil rich countryand the EU won't want to lose that
5796 2018-08-10 18:51:40 Unfortunately most of big oil is owned by foreign oil companies and they want oil exported to them to be refined and then sold back to Canadians at highly inflates prices! And our governments over the years have allowed foreign buyers to take our oil products!

5799 2018-08-10 18:51:22 Didn’t they just want to get western oil to tide water in Saint John. I don’t think Irving had any plans of refining it for our use.
5800 2018-08-10 18:51:10 The study is what kicked off all this bullshit. Plus, the pharma shill card is tired old code for 'I have no actual proof, just conspiracy theories and Dunning Krueger'. This kind of arrogant snake oil peddling gets people killed.
5801 2018-08-10 18:50:53 Also not from a radical country, seem capable of self sufficiency, elderly and unlikely to take up antithetical ideology. To be fair, ANY change at all will not affect the connected, as is the case now and prob always will be.
5802 2018-08-10 18:50:53 “Ethical oil” was the phrase that crazed, disbarred lawyer & rebel media founder Ezra Levent came up with. 
How many rebel media people have the ear of Andy again?
5803 2018-08-10 18:50:47 They're vegan so I don't mind no diary because I don't eat that. It is made w/ palm oil & lots of sugar though which is terrible for us of course. I really limit my purchasing of palm oil products cuz of rainforest defirestation, but they're just so delicious.

5807 2018-08-10 18:49:26 The protection KSA enjoys from most of the world is about many things, oil, Sunni v Shia, Israel - and none of them look like the means of ensuring a peaceful future.  
Sadly, much too late for Yemen and her people.

5810 2018-08-10 18:49:01 Sounds nice.  But it can easily be argued that "humanity" was better with ignorance of science (tribal life).  Oil/Plastics, nuclear war, antibiotics, constant news
5811 2018-08-10 18:49:01 What are some things that can make your hair grow fast, oil, vitamins anything
5812 2018-08-10 18:48:59 It's all to do with OIL stupid
5813 2018-08-10 18:48:57 I'm not sure what we are talking about here...I'm just talking about the family based immigration categories, specifically for parents, that Trump has pushed to eliminate.  Not talking about "illegals".
5814 2018-08-10 18:48:56 it’s usually the Firestone employees that tell me what I need but today I came in and I said “I need an oil change, and alignment check, and a tire rotation, also, my driver rear tire probably has a screw”
5815 2018-08-10 18:48:56 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5816 2018-08-10 18:48:36 That's how my son asked me..
Him: mummy, what do they do In the UAE? Why are they rich?
Me: a big oil producing nation plus planning. 
Him: OK. So Nigeria didn't plan?
Me: yes. But why do you say that?
Him: it's oil that Nigeria produces too.
Me: sigh
5817 2018-08-10 18:48:22 I am curious to know what pwani oil thinks will happen if they don't sexualize their cooking oils advertisements.

5830 2018-08-10 18:47:11 we will see priorities change in an instant and many millions searching for oil for their lamps.
5831 2018-08-10 18:46:51 Since many in Canada feel that Alberta's oil is bad but have no problem with oil from Saudi Arabia I propose that rather than claiming we are better than the Saudis we should instead try to be more like them.

5839 2018-08-10 18:45:55 That doesn't mean Canadas position is wrong. It just means that the US has lost its moral compass under Donald Trump and Europe would rather hide in the corner than take a stand. Asia is heavily dependent on ME oil so they are covering their own ass by not saying anything.
5840 2018-08-10 18:45:53 They have oil. They can try to destabilise Canada because they believe in human rights but it makes no difference to the USA they want war as it is profitable. Isolate the USA. Trade deals with China iran Russia and show them the USA that the world don’t need them.

5844 2018-08-10 18:44:56 You're probably right. I guess the lesson here is that when a guy rails against chain migration, if the guy is the president, we should probably not scrutinize his personal activities too closely.
5845 2018-08-10 18:44:47 The oil mentality is seriously deep cut into our fibre, and it has stopped us from thinking, the elite and political class are so cut up in it and has refuse to chart a path to prosperity for the next generation, but surely it might hit us like a tsunami.
5846 2018-08-10 18:44:40 how many miles is too many miles past an oil change? this is a serious q, so y’all help a girl out.

5850 2018-08-10 18:44:25 The Premier won't do a damned thing about gas prices. The oil companies are the real power here. Isn't higher gas prices means more taxation both federally & provincially...more revenue to their coffers?

5855 2018-08-10 18:44:03 I think we all know most shareholders don't just want a return, we are betting on our survival, once we no longer depend on big oil then we are on the way to fixing our broken climate. @tesla

5858 2018-08-10 18:43:40 Trudeau should retaliate against US tariffs by putting a $50 per barrel tariff on US oil imported into eastern Canada. You know, to teach them a lesson. 
5859 2018-08-10 18:43:33 I’ll take a picture when I get home. But in general I think really highly of most Mario Badescu products, Manyo Factory (pricier), and Elizavecca. I’m crazy about DHC’s cleansing oil - and cleansing oil in general.
5860 2018-08-10 18:43:26 At the mechanic getting an oil change and there's a female mechanic. I'm so happy rn! #GetItGirl
5861 2018-08-10 18:43:19 I've already eaten 3/4 of it.  loool I might not buy from again. Thing is my boss always complained that they fry chicken in fish oil. That should've been a clue tbh
5862 2018-08-10 18:43:14 I'm going to ask a question that I expect will receive the usual ugliness from partisan assholes. I'm hoping someone out there can answer this question reasonably.
1) Is it Quebec that buys oil from SA or is it Irving Oil? Same applies to NB
5863 2018-08-10 18:43:13 I alert on coconut oil. What's going on here.
5864 2018-08-10 18:42:57 Saudi Arabia is such a shit show. No body works (only foreigners). It is all government handouts. Multiple wives means there are a lot of pissed of young guys. When oil prices go down they have to quickly dip into their cash reverses to keep the lights on buy food etc.
5865 2018-08-10 18:42:53 According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Bank of America, the United States is now the world’s largest oil and natural gas liquids producer and will remain so for awhile, overtaking both Saudi Arabia and Russia.
5866 2018-08-10 18:42:47 Abeg @Woulk3r how much is beard oil?
5867 2018-08-10 18:42:44 A room? A ROOM?! That would interfere with my plans of getting naked & lathering up in coconut oil & running full speed ahead w/ the ocean waves crashing in the background as Angels sing in immaculate chorus signifying their approval of our reunion. A room would simply ruin that.
5868 2018-08-10 18:42:42 But it's so good in the oven with olive oil, sea salt, and granulated garlic 
5869 2018-08-10 18:42:11 It is unfair to compare snake oil salesmen, like @CVSpharmacy, to hate-speech mongers.
5870 2018-08-10 18:42:04 Just bought a new car battery junk still tweaking  lemme go get an oil change

5872 2018-08-10 18:41:51 EXACTLY. (Sort of) 

They have debt. We do not. We can sue them for (pick a very big  number) but still survive easilly AND take N Sea oil (desirable and great but not essential)
5873 2018-08-10 18:41:49 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
5874 2018-08-10 18:41:49 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5875 2018-08-10 18:41:41 Same as Cuba minus the oil. Prevent someone from trading and then, 60 years later, point a finger at them and show how poor they are. No shit Sherlock.
5876 2018-08-10 18:41:38 If car mechanics were like doctors, they’d tell you to change your car oil each visit, and in a few weeks there wouldn’t be any cars on the street.

Or maybe it’s healthcare in Dubai. From insurance to the actual doctors the whole thing is a catastrophe here
5877 2018-08-10 18:41:16 I wear a satin doek but because my spritz has a bit if oil in it, it seaps right through.
5878 2018-08-10 18:41:10 They all complain about the dangers of oil to the aquatic ecosystem and human rights but yet refuse a pipeline that is about 100 times safer and more ethically sourced.
5879 2018-08-10 18:41:08 A lot do. Of course not in the Vancouver area but oil&gas.  I grossed 260k in 2015 but will never work like that again just to be raped by the govt and that was thru a union contractor
5880 2018-08-10 18:41:04 State basically abdicating it's responsibility to educate children because we're ruled by oil corporations and special interests that put profits above all
5881 2018-08-10 18:41:03 Roasted with garlic, salt & pepper and a little olive oil.  Super good!
5882 2018-08-10 18:41:01 Nails! Hair! Treat meal!! Oil change! I’m productive as hell right now!! 
5883 2018-08-10 18:40:51 Her parents aren't from Norway my friend. We can't be too careful.
5884 2018-08-10 18:40:44 #Germany should now not buy #SaudiArabia 's oil
5885 2018-08-10 18:40:41 How come they're not actually doing anything to end the age of oil other than complaining about it?  Be the change you want to see in the world.  Be a scientist or engineer and design some new stuff that'll will lead is into the future. It's no solution to just whine and obstruct
5886 2018-08-10 18:40:38 If you want to live longer:

Lean protein
Fruits and Veggies, esp greens
Nuts, olive oil, avocados, fish oil

Minimize:
Grains
Added Sugar
5887 2018-08-10 18:40:25 It's look like a spurge (from which castor oil is produced)....but I'm not sure. in the northwest of Argentina you can found a lot!!
5888 2018-08-10 18:40:22 Probably because you’re buying body mist type perfumes which have low perfume oil concentration and only last like 2 hours.
5889 2018-08-10 18:40:12 I use it for my eyelashes as well as my hair and eyebrows. My eyelashes got super long, and my eye brows got thicker and fuller and my hair. I used Jamaican Black Castor Oil from Walmart. It’s a good remedy if you ask me. 
5890 2018-08-10 18:40:09 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
5891 2018-08-10 18:40:07 Venezuela is under US sanctions for having largest oil supply in the world but not wanting to get robbed by the oil cartel. This is the main problem of their troubles and not socialism. Socialism came as a natural response to economic exploitation and poverty caused by plunder.
5892 2018-08-10 18:39:53 Do you think a ketogenic diet based on avocado, olive oil, sprouted nuts and cheese could work? IOW, is there a mostly plant-based (with cheese/butter/ghee added) version that checks out?
5893 2018-08-10 18:39:52 Countries with the most oil reserves (2017 data):
1- Venezuela 
2- Saudi Arabia
3- Canada 
#بس_هيك
5894 2018-08-10 18:39:43 Peter Lougheed did great things. But the PC’s prior to the 2015 election absolutely drove us into a ditch with no gas money. Biggest boom in history, and were still running multi billion deficits. Oil crashed and province was broke in an instant.
5895 2018-08-10 18:39:40 I took my car in to get 2 new tires and an oil change, and now I owe $800 because my dad told them do to other things without telling me, that’s just great 
5896 2018-08-10 18:39:40 Fridays when his kids are gone and Mr. Drumpf lies, a depressed snail whispers #covfefe
5897 2018-08-10 18:39:39 Looks like they are hedging with oil names instead, in case the fiasco with Turkey worsens.  My 2¢ at least
5898 2018-08-10 18:39:36 I’m playing my switch while I’m waiting to get my oil changed but I should’ve bought a book instead
5899 2018-08-10 18:39:32 Oil n gas,,
Itu di bio ada 
5900 2018-08-10 18:39:25 In the 1980's a certain Middle East Country had lots of oil. It did not extract it so it had NO costs. Instead it borrowed against that oil. Scotland could extract NO OIL and still be rich.
5901 2018-08-10 18:39:22 It's as irrelevant as using a Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk to justify it. Using an aberrant data point to prove a wider theory,  postulation or disprove it is not honest and doesnt represent reality. Using the mean makes the case for restrictions
5902 2018-08-10 18:39:09 Kleveru vit e oil
5903 2018-08-10 18:39:05 They have. They also claimed sovereignty over North Sea Oil. When it was discovered. Canada didn’t do that. Oil belongs to the extractor. How would we buy back the land?
5904 2018-08-10 18:38:45 Last night I dreamed my mom dragged me to a showing of some lost early-sound movie. It included dinner served in-theater, but the only gf option was mac&cheese with gddmn pineapple in it. During the show, the fryer in the kitchen broke, & the smell of rancid oil was overpowering.
5905 2018-08-10 18:38:36 I am interesting in CBD oil from @laurasmercantile@DocJohnG Our website has 0 ads and loads of info.
5906 2018-08-10 18:38:34 “Oil pipelines” oh those things Alberta want to put in.”
Oh I”m pondering it. Got to go surfing in BC . Catch ya in a month or two”.   That’s Trudeau’s probable reply
5907 2018-08-10 18:38:28 Oh yes, the same idiots who ran out of North Sea oil reserves to hold her own failing economy together, handing her country two massive recessions while in office
5908 2018-08-10 18:38:24 #StateOfCorruption kidero son selling fake oil to kenyans his father looted 21b nobody cares. Imagine if it was rutos son hizi streets kungekua kumewaka moto
5909 2018-08-10 18:38:12 My lil dumb ass gone stop putting on coconut oil before going outside 
5910 2018-08-10 18:38:11 Putting a whole gram of oil in a backwood when I get off work !
5911 2018-08-10 18:38:09 I’m getting my oil changed and they’re playing When You Look Me in the Eyes by the Jonas Brothers. This is the American Dream.
5912 2018-08-10 18:38:04 For soup, cook minced shallots in oil, then simmer with tofu, green curry paste, vegetable broth and zucchini. Top with tarragon.
5913 2018-08-10 18:37:50 Ordered fisherman soup, I got palm oil stew with grated okro and catfish ...smh tired of lagosians
5914 2018-08-10 18:37:31 True, then there’s getting the chilli olive oil drizzle just so...
5915 2018-08-10 18:37:23 Oil
5916 2018-08-10 18:37:20 Nothing will get better in Calgary until Notley is gone. The oil patch has zero trust in either her sincerity or competence. And a lot of head office jobs, once gone to other places, will never come back.
5917 2018-08-10 18:37:15 Get the Kiehl's midnight recovery concentrate! It will clear your excess oil right up.
5918 2018-08-10 18:37:09 Turkey may have to default,especially as Oil soon rises and oil is paid in US dollars ,forcing an economic bank collapse in Turkey
5919 2018-08-10 18:37:07 Is it possible to pay beautiful black men to oil themselves and just walk circles around you in very slow motion? Asking for a friend
5920 2018-08-10 18:37:02 Keep turning heat up doesn't make much difference. Slice potatoes and squash fling into oven dish with olive oil. Will have omelet. My heels hurt
5921 2018-08-10 18:37:01 Went to Pep Boys in Smyrna, had an appointment for 1PM, reaches on time, took them an hr and a half for the oil change, I complained and they were nice enough not to charge me for it! Thankyou Pep Boys!!!
5922 2018-08-10 18:37:00 Did your news reader really say - “that Trevon Martin thing” - it’s bad enough that person loads their lips with 10/40 motor oil but the above comment is insensitive
5923 2018-08-10 18:36:52 Castor Oil.
5924 2018-08-10 18:36:22 I feel like I’m constantly telling my dealership, “sorry my car is messy” when I get an oil change. 
5925 2018-08-10 18:35:51 Only a more sophisticate version of the sign at a tea-stall outside Apollo Hospital, advertising in Bengali "Tele-bhaja (Pakodas) fried in pure Mustard oil" obviously targeted at relations of patients who come there from Bengal for treatment (commonly Coronary Bypass Surgery) 
5926 2018-08-10 18:35:40 Nigeria’s stocks entered a bear market as worsening political tensions and an emerging-market sell-off caused foreign investors to shun assets in Africa’s biggest oil producer.
5927 2018-08-10 18:35:33 Believe it or not, most people in the suburbs hate the inner-city Berkeley transplants.  Some of us miss the old Portland.  (And outside of that metro area, Oregon is a red state.)  Plus it’s too beautiful to burn.  We need to take it back!
5928 2018-08-10 18:35:25 Talking potential minor league baseball names in our office. How about something that sums up our history. Something like the Wichita Oil Cow Pizza Planes.

Can't wait to turn that over to the logo designer.
5929 2018-08-10 18:35:16 You already don't control the destiny of your children. They were given into superior custody because you are a lying charlatan who makes his living hocking snake oil to the gullible and foolish. Your entire profession is performed from your knees, begger-man.
5930 2018-08-10 18:34:59 i bought a diffuser and a essential oil vaporizer thing this is my desperate attempt at being cAlm
5931 2018-08-10 18:34:57 My aunt in Trinidad send me a bottle of homemade coconut oil AND pepper sauce . That’s love fr

5937 2018-08-10 18:34:05 Igbos are never thinking of developing their homeland; Oil has brought us bloodshed & balkanisation of our homeland due to oil politics. We should be thinking of building a strong, green and innovative economy in the East, instead of insisting on saving Nigeria since 1929.
5938 2018-08-10 18:34:00 need a oil change .

5940 2018-08-10 18:33:58 • COCONUT OIL+CUCUMBER •

-rub coconut oil under the eyes + place cool cucumber on the eyelids.

{coconut oil brightens dark circles + cucumber cools down the eyes and reduces puffiness}
5941 2018-08-10 18:33:43 Great job boss. Good luck tomorrow night.
5942 2018-08-10 18:33:40 Take one cap of vegetable oil. You will sleep in the toilet
5943 2018-08-10 18:33:33 Thank you!! You give us the perfect example of the brainwashing that goes on in our schools (and why politicos pump huge $$$$ into it).

Riddle me this: How much oil did we get from Iraq? Don't hurt yourself looking for it. The answer is none. Zero. Nada. Back to school for you.
5944 2018-08-10 18:33:03 Yes canda us and canada will. It will start crusading saudi ass by first producing more oil cheaper than saudi
5945 2018-08-10 18:32:51 I totally agree.  Using Canadian oil and gas in eastern Canada would also reduce our use of Middle East oil. But Quebec opposed the Energy East pipeline, and Quebec votes are more important than BC votes.
5946 2018-08-10 18:32:50 If @JustinTrudeau were serious, he'd double down and cancel all Saudi oil imports now.  #cdnpoli

"Other reasons that have previously warranted crucifixion include homosexuality and political activism."
5947 2018-08-10 18:32:47 I always suspected Allan Adams was blocking the tar sends to negotiate for more money.

Now he is outright standing with the corporations.

Canada bought used machinery that’s worthless as oil & gas markets die. Why else would they offer Indians “a controlled share”?
5948 2018-08-10 18:32:46 Erdogan must be charged criminally for genocide of Kurds & also for imprisoning thousands of his own people & torture. Expel Turkey from NATO & a total economic & oil blockade - it's the only language he understands. F-35 in his possession should be destroyed for obvious reasons
5949 2018-08-10 18:32:40 Or vegetable oil!
5950 2018-08-10 18:32:36 I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t devastated to be standing on the other side of the @SpiritDrumCorps hornline today, but I hope the knock the walls down in Lucas Oil.
5951 2018-08-10 18:32:34 Olive oil is good fat, drizzle it on with a splash of balsamic vinegar and boom you have flavour
5952 2018-08-10 18:32:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
5953 2018-08-10 18:32:30 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
5954 2018-08-10 18:32:27 The argument that restricted immigration or tough enforcement deprives us of the next Yahoo or Amazon is playing to simple minded.
1 in 500,000 or 1 mil justifies it from an econ standpoint? Counter to current lib econ claims of inequality and wealth creation
5955 2018-08-10 18:32:20 OBO.  A great scooter to ride around town. I’ve used it for 2 years to commute to work daily. Great on gas ($2 a week). Just had an oil change at Skinner’s and switched out the back tire not to long ago as well. Cross posted.
5956 2018-08-10 18:32:13 Peppermint oil is a lifesaver

5961 2018-08-10 18:31:42 Today, an “ex” oil lobbyist working in @Interior made an argument for why we should dismantle the Endangered Species Act. He is wrong, and we will fight this with everything we’ve got. #StopExtinction #StopBernhardt #StopZinke
5962 2018-08-10 18:31:35 Olive oil definitely does not belong in every hair product. Especially EDGE CONTROL!!!  Soon as I put that shit in my hair & step outside.. my hair lifts right back up. TAKE THAT OIL SHIT OUT
5963 2018-08-10 18:31:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet without fear about these important and sensitive issues.
5964 2018-08-10 18:31:03 Love using coconut oil as a natural moisturizer but HATE when that shit gets in my eyes and makes them water  looks like i went through a terrible breakup lmfao
5965 2018-08-10 18:30:51 I still can not believe that they still crucifying people like in the times of Christ. I also believe that it was the right thing to do for Canada, to stand for its citizens. The US and UK are slaves of the Saudis, due to Big arms contract, Oil etc.. you get my picture.
5966 2018-08-10 18:30:50 Nothing but the oil in the pan. Wbu?
5967 2018-08-10 18:30:29 I know the feds be watching text messages. I was talking about edibles then got an email about cannabis oil 
5968 2018-08-10 18:30:27 any essential oil fanatics out there??? hmu
5969 2018-08-10 18:30:17 If you ever get splattered by hot oil when putting something into it with your bare hands, you’ve got nobody else to blame but yourself. #dumbass

The system designed with integrated checks &balances but this pple find ways to 'oil every part of the wheel'
That's why outsiders often 'give up & pay up'
5979 2018-08-10 18:29:25 Fact that they got away with hitting folk on the head for no reason blocks the only country with real oil & gas reserves in EU (admittedly nothing more than a bonus!), with greater renewable energy & selling electricity to their neighbour, to be held back by Francophile nazis!

5991 2018-08-10 18:28:22 Yes, the media trumpets would have been the all-out attack, but because they wore the Saudi dollar's glasses and the smell of oil grew, they were silent
5992 2018-08-10 18:28:21 Dang it I took the time to comb and oil up my beard. I guess I will just go wash it out now.
5993 2018-08-10 18:28:06 forced to hop on the no oil trend becuz olive oil is expensive as fuck
5994 2018-08-10 18:28:06 Also Kevin , the gov pays for numerous wasteful projects that use/ sap our tax  dollars ( bloated military projects,  oil subsidies , wars) that enrich private interests and individuals , how do you feel about those use of gov funds? Serious question
5995 2018-08-10 18:27:59 Somebody remind me to get some peppermint oil when I get off work
5996 2018-08-10 18:27:50 Cinderella but it’s in her dad’s gym and she’s made to clean & oil the machines after her dad dies but she falls for one of the regular gym-goers training to win the Crown title and there’s a big afterparty & her fairy godmother makes her a dress out of blueroll & a barbell limo
5997 2018-08-10 18:27:41 But regarding chain or family based migration, if it's a bad thing, as Trump and his supporters allege, why not use Melania's parents as an example of why it's bad? Let's hear the bad things that happen when her parents are allowed to come here.
5998 2018-08-10 18:27:16 That’s what I’ve heard! One of my Aunts does the essential oil thing, she gave me some tea tree oil. Smells good, calls me down too :3
5999 2018-08-10 18:27:13 Not quite.
He hates poor brown people.
Wealthy, oil rich Arabs are some of his favorite fascist type brown people.
6000 2018-08-10 18:27:09 I had all the above and solved it with a good waterpill from the Dr and marijuana oil just before bed.
6001 2018-08-10 18:26:57 I’m 98% sure I’ve never been sober when I get an oil change 
6002 2018-08-10 18:26:27 I strongly condemn this incident, Oil nahi lagana chahiye tha 
6003 2018-08-10 18:26:20 do you want one that beats them on a study done on a ketogenic diet , or tuumeric, or fish oil or an elimination diet
6004 2018-08-10 18:26:12 it said coconut and argon oil based
6005 2018-08-10 18:26:09 Goodies are now seen in  turkana,is it because of the presence oil or change of politics?used to be another unimportant part of Ke.
6006 2018-08-10 18:25:57 Hugs gently to avoid back strain
Try going out to your local smoke shop of Walmart you can buy a nice incense set for less than 10 bucks
Opinion by the oil warmer as it's less money and easier clean up
6007 2018-08-10 18:25:46 Disagree. We'd be producing oil to our standards, selling it domestically at the price it costs to produce it, and selling the rest abroad.

There's no way letting all the profits leave the country is better for us.
6008 2018-08-10 18:25:42 It makes no sense, use Canadian oil and stop importing oil!
6009 2018-08-10 18:25:40 It's great. Apparently we should refine our own product. Which would mean investing in refineries. Also human rights is concern so exporting to China is a bad thing. Ha. Lets do it. Keep our oil in Canada and become self sufficient.
6010 2018-08-10 18:25:25 Seeing what Saudi Arabia and Qatar are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil

6014 2018-08-10 18:25:00 yeah I looked it up and it said try tea tree oil and sea salt so I’m gonna try it and hopefully it works.

6017 2018-08-10 18:24:39 Environmental & social impacts of palm oil production assessed? High risk that monoculture of palm oil in large areas of tropical forests and ecosystems with high conservation values will destroy critical habitat for many endangered species, including rhinos and elephants.

6019 2018-08-10 18:24:28 Electric vehicles and $5 barrel oil, thus making it hard for the Saudis to pay for the weapons.
6020 2018-08-10 18:24:20 Is there where you're going to do the massive oil drilling that you promised @realDonaldTrump, Lisa?
6021 2018-08-10 18:23:59 They slick hitting licks for these oil changes 
6022 2018-08-10 18:23:56 Perfect. You have to do a lipsync to "Slide Some Oil to Me," though.
6023 2018-08-10 18:23:49 Those who said they'd rather cook it at home, you can see her for oil and rice
6024 2018-08-10 18:23:44 @FredMatiangi you are only one to help Kenyans from hands of Chinese. Carry everything to kenya including onions, oil, beer etc to Kenya
6025 2018-08-10 18:23:42 I use the argan oil ones and my skin is so clear!!! They only burn if it majorly goes in my eyes .....
6026 2018-08-10 18:23:42 Before the dirty oil money arrived your lot hadn’t won it since 1968. Even more embarrassing 
6027 2018-08-10 18:23:40 Thanks  all that tea tree oil and water 
6028 2018-08-10 18:23:35 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
6029 2018-08-10 18:23:22 It's weird that people keep quoting that "Coconut Oil + H2O = Glow" photo to complain about how no one is fat shaming him. If he's not the one fat shaming women then it's rather weird to be in his mentions with all that
6030 2018-08-10 18:23:16 Probably couldn’t plug it in to reset. Know you can do it through menus on my car as well, but as use long life oils etc it needs to be told that it’s got new long life oil in, even indeed if it has.
6031 2018-08-10 18:23:04 Biofuels can be the best possible alternate fuel. Compressed biogas can benefit small villages and towns. We should focus on such alternative energy sources rather than exploring in oil fields.
6032 2018-08-10 18:23:03 Well but it hurts the American consumer for china to take our oil (price often rises when they import) sooooo it's a good choice for them to keep taking it.  Especially in late August when gas prices nearly always drop precipitously.

6040 2018-08-10 18:22:09 The first pipeline had been approved and groundwork laid while Liberals were in power, the second two while Harper was in. Many oil pipelines laid in earlier Liberal years as well. Takes a while to get approved just to get the routes right.

6045 2018-08-10 18:21:41 Check the average league position from 1990 til now and see the upturn it takes from 2001 on. You can’t build a super club overnight unless you have oil money but I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be like City or Chelsea would you? If you do, then Chelsea and City were made for you
6046 2018-08-10 18:21:38 Nobody is seriously thinking about what would hold Nigeria together - after oil.

And we'll start feeling the pressure in a few decades.

Please note: the upcoming generation will be cynical and unlikely to view Nigeria through rose-tinted spectacles like Dr. Joe.
6047 2018-08-10 18:21:23 Buy Castor oil it helps 
6048 2018-08-10 18:21:14 it's going well! though i can't tell if it's because i cut out products or because i'm limiting my coffee intake lol. do you have recommendations for oil cleansers (looking at banila) or serums? main concern has been lingering marks, and idk if my vitamin c serum has helped.
6049 2018-08-10 18:21:12 Oil Rice get brand.. God bless Ghana and Twitter... I always say this. TWITTER IS THE PLATFORM FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. Misbehaving is nice, but look sharp your next customer, job, bae or anything else is just around the corner
6050 2018-08-10 18:21:08 I suppose you think oil is produced cleanly and naturally in Saudi Arabia?

If you don't like oil, quit using it. Until that day, we may as well buy from ourselves.
6051 2018-08-10 18:21:04 "I may not know how this thing works but I know that: it has oil; the oil must be changed; or it won't work at all"

6054 2018-08-10 18:20:38 Have I mentioned recently my love for CBD oil? <3

Blessed, blessed pain relief!
6055 2018-08-10 18:20:36 Sorry. No. What we would be doing is subsidizing the price of oil to Canadian citizens. Nobody wins that way. And who would want to put up venture capital for that?
6056 2018-08-10 18:20:18 Most jobs added this month were part time. This unemployment level is funded with unsustainable tax hikes, borrowing from our children, and non-recession deficit spending.

Let's bring back good, full time jobs with benefits. We need healthy industry to get them. Start with oil.

6059 2018-08-10 18:20:00 Worse - having your entire economy based on a single contested and non renewable resource (oil) whose price fluctuates heavily was very dangerous for them, and not a problem we have.
6060 2018-08-10 18:19:50 Global oil demand is on the rise so I don't know what you talking about and it sounds like nether do you. Oil isn't going anywhere for some time, so deal with it. Canada needs pipelines and refineries ASAP. The soon we start building the better off Canada will be.
6061 2018-08-10 18:19:43 MLS, literally City’s entire class of player before the oil money arrived. 
6062 2018-08-10 18:19:43 So we can use our bitumen rich oil right out of the tar sands?

Are you capable of being truthful? #InquiringMindsWantToKnow
6063 2018-08-10 18:19:28 Perhaps I wasn’t clear, I didn’t say you said you guys weren’t buying saudi oil, I was meaning to say if you guy have plenty here for your own needs why do yous then buy saudi oil everyday? That’s could mean the same thing I said before, Canadian oil isn’t clean enough to use RA.
6064 2018-08-10 18:19:27 Energy East was for exporting oil though not to replace Saudi oil in Canada.
6065 2018-08-10 18:19:19 I’m proud that @JustinTrudeau and @cafreeland stood up to Saudi Arabia. We can do even more damage if we cut ties with them regarding oil. We have the capacity here in Canada to meet our own needs.
6066 2018-08-10 18:19:06 I thought this was the unwritten deal. We buy their oil, bribe them to buy them, they umm and arr, then finally do buy them but agree not to use them. Now we're guiding the fucking things into school buses.

6072 2018-08-10 18:18:29 Walk into the service shop for a $40 oil change, walk out of the service shop having spent $80 and finding out I'll have to spend $900 on a full new set of tires soon.... WHAT KIND OF SICK JOKE IS THIS, IF THIS IS ADULT LIFE I TAKE IT BACK
6073 2018-08-10 18:18:26 So I'm getting my oil changed (thanks @Valvoline) and the dude in the bay next to me is chugging a 2 liter of  @MountainDew....
6074 2018-08-10 18:18:24 one of our customers was just threatened to have immigration called on his ass by a competing oil distributor name O'Reilly's ironically enough ....what's most important here is that our customer is a US citizen and that's why we aren't lying when we say #ALLCALIFORNIA
6075 2018-08-10 18:18:24 then you shud have sex,,,it does a body good, jus like a car needs an oil change

6081 2018-08-10 18:17:32 It's normal to be afraid! I was too when Mido ran out. You could also leave out a can of sardines outside, the boneless kind in oil would be perfect, and strong smelling canned cat food near the door as the smell is sure to attract her back!
6082 2018-08-10 18:17:23 Argh, no. And they also contain palm oil.

6085 2018-08-10 18:17:13 You could also pick out one rehabilitated violent felon that got a Phd and made good to make the case that all violent felons are equal to that one. It would not be representative of the general group. Transparent tactic used by illegal/open border activists
6086 2018-08-10 18:16:57 Well note to self: don’t put olbas oil in your ears to unblock them, it won’t work
6087 2018-08-10 18:16:56 Trudeau didn't kill #EnergyEast- WE did- people who vote in Ontario & Québec & care about protecting our environment. Unlike Conservatives, recalling Harper's reign. #Tarsands oil is dirty oil, dilbit sinks when spilled, #pipelines to ship oil abroad to nonexistent Asian markets.

Then, simply shake the bottle & spray on needed surfaces.
6089 2018-08-10 18:16:41 La refineria Beva Oil que essta en Alemania, fue vendida por el mismo Chavez. Pocos se acuerdan de esa venta en detrimiento de la nacion.
6090 2018-08-10 18:16:41 Shirtless and covered in oil, Tom Fulp was maniacally laughing while holding a glowing amulet. I tried to reach for my gun but Oiled-Up Shirtless Tom Fulp was too fast! He grabbed me from behind and suplexed me unconscious.
6091 2018-08-10 18:16:41 We do produce oil here, well over 3 million barrels per day.

But tar sands production is not clean. It requires open pit mining and immense amount of water. Our "standards" permit billions of gallons of polluted waste water to sit in open tailing ponds.
6092 2018-08-10 18:16:37 Shut up please you make you religion look dumb with these sort of tweets
6093 2018-08-10 18:16:32 Just had a great auto service experience with service Manager Joneil at #jiffylube on West Atlantic in Delray  I would recommend this place for your next oil change.

6106 2018-08-10 18:15:08 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.

6112 2018-08-10 18:14:24 What is your favorite way to use Helichrysum essential oil? Fun Fact: Helichrysum petals were used throughout Europe as a strewing herb (an herb scattered on the floor for the aroma and other purposes) in Medieval times.
6113 2018-08-10 18:14:18 It was Vezir so he could be a snake oil salesman
6114 2018-08-10 18:14:04 Supplementary food is not available at other reintroduction sites, neither is tourism, and those orangutans have higher survival rates, better post-release adaptation, and no reliance on humans. The problem is rehabilitation protocols, not palm oil.
6115 2018-08-10 18:14:03 If the Gulf oil rig explosion was invested, u would find big payoffs to fed QC officials to look the other way.  There is no need for deep water rigs; should be closer to shore, if there is an issue it can be repaired in hours rather than weeks.
6116 2018-08-10 18:13:57 So in regards to this, Harper had no courage in over a decade right? I mean, I bet u didn’t mind buying SA oil when he was PM. Am I right? Hypocrite.

6119 2018-08-10 18:13:50 Data is new oil said Shri Mukesh Ambani. Did not understand the profound power of that statement but now looks like an understatement, data is more powerful than oil. The proposed law punishes victim more than male. That point no one highlights. That is real problem with the law.
6120 2018-08-10 18:13:49 Nigeria is irrelevant to America.

" Two-way trade between the US and Africa has plummeted from roughly $142 billion in 2008 to $55 billion last year, largely because the US has become increasingly energy self-sufficient, removing the need for African crude oil"
6121 2018-08-10 18:13:37 yeh, better to plug it in and have the oil burn somewhere else. and hope it doesnt have any issues or you can wait a year for service, so make sure you rent a second car in case you need it.
6122 2018-08-10 18:13:33 know what else is dangerous? Oil spills.
6123 2018-08-10 18:13:32 Kind of like Standard Oil?  Facebook of Ohio, Continental Facebook. Texafacebook. etc.

6126 2018-08-10 18:12:50 With Saudi Arabia? If so, you're a conservative are you not? Your original tweet suggests that you'd like Canada's oil nationalized as a solution. I agree. Do you think the Conservative Party agrees with you and me? Nope. I bet the NDP does though.
6127 2018-08-10 18:12:48 for the argan oil i spread it throughout all of my hair and the coconut i just do my roots
6128 2018-08-10 18:12:44 Same principle used to putout oil well fires.
6129 2018-08-10 18:12:43 scrubs and textbooks have been ordered, and i finally got an oil change for my car which was only 7,000 miles over due. nothing like waiting for the last two weeks of summer to get my shit together

6133 2018-08-10 18:12:14 Mies van der rohe was everybody's architectural daddy. We were lucky to have him move to Chicago from Germany and start a whole new movement. I can was poetic about chicago architects oil the cows come home. We have a new superstar in Jeanne Gang as well.

6135 2018-08-10 18:11:51 I meant of top of that...  He did do quite a good job at lying and scaring all those people.  He probably got expenses, a big hourly rate and a healthy bonus.  Maybe he got paid on Scottish oil business profits, you know, the ones that Scotland never gets
6136 2018-08-10 18:11:49 The Saudis launch a social media campaign that they could never ever win due to their horrendous human rights violations + their continued financial support of global terrorism.  What will happen to the Middle East when alternate forms of energy, rather than oil, take over?
6137 2018-08-10 18:11:38 
Canada wake up your getting schooled in a bad way S.A is crushing you everywhere possible & then you write them a HUGE CHEQUE every month for their oil. NEWS FLASH they will take you cash all day long!!  TO BAD you can't tell them to go pound sand & buy CANADIAN OIL

6141 2018-08-10 18:11:31 We can control the price and demand of oil for domestic consumption. Why should all that wealth leave our country? And why should it go to evil countries like Saudi Arabia?

If we can sell extra (which we obviously can) then even better!

6145 2018-08-10 18:11:11 Man, I buy coconut water at $5 per and drink it every day. lmaooo Olive oil, Organic fruits, veggies, etc.
6146 2018-08-10 18:11:04 The govt doesn't buy oil.
6147 2018-08-10 18:10:53 Everyone excited for FPL now, when it’s February you’ll start hearing ‘I got tired & didn’t change my team again’. Obviously when you’re down the table digging for Oil 
6148 2018-08-10 18:10:41 It's all about oil. 
Trudeau's disdain for oil is evident.
The fact that Canada needs oil is obvious.
You don't bite the hand that feeds you.

6153 2018-08-10 18:10:28 Norway have own production, UK doesn't. Norway also make money from oil, UK doesn't. Norway as part of the EEA have to comply with the 4 basic EU rules, the UK government is refusing to do so. Norway is a bad example to give.

6156 2018-08-10 18:10:20 Tillerson did our country no favors while decimating the Department of State and cozying up to the Russian oil industry. His half hearted/assed calling out of Trump as a moron doesn't entitle him to an elevated standing in my book.
6157 2018-08-10 18:10:18 Yes indeed.  Ms RMC's birthday a weekend on a canal boat between Bath and Bradford upon Avon.  It's like driving an oil tanker!
6158 2018-08-10 18:10:16 I was a legal recruiter as one of my temp jobs when I lived in manhattan ,one of the practices our clients dealt in OFTEN were mortgage back securities. Luxury Apartments -Trump Tower sell like umbrellas in the rain to oil money folks from Texas-cant sell them fast enough.

6164 2018-08-10 18:09:37 I spent ~10 Years working with OI, at the old Wearhouse in Wootton. Helping development of the whole body scanner. One year, we were collecting heating oil in the P100 pick-up. The toilets still froze!! We kept on working. It was so cold we had to warm up the liquid Helium. };0)
6165 2018-08-10 18:09:33 We need another industry in Alberta to pick up the slack when the oil patch slows down, it's been like this for too long now.

maybe we should be the ones building electric cars, turbines, and solar panels.
6166 2018-08-10 18:09:21 Elsewhere? He seem to forget living in one of coutries with biggest oil resorces? Apparently! Pathetick!
6167 2018-08-10 18:09:19 Jason, Thoughts on refining oil here in Alberta?
6168 2018-08-10 18:09:09 Right. Food. Then prep bike for tomorrow (oil chain, put food in bike bag). Then early night.

6179 2018-08-10 18:07:36 ahhh that’s good to know i haven’t tried that on the one in my nose i’m gonna give it a go!! i clean my ear piercings with tea tree oil sometimes and it stings so bad i feel
6180 2018-08-10 18:07:31 How lovely. I can't go down to the beach with Bertie atm cos the last time i did a beach clean i found several clumps of palm oil !!
6181 2018-08-10 18:07:30 Christianity is another snake oil. They developed tolerance but did not reform much in terms of absolute devotion. Expectation of divine reward & therefore my god is better than yours bullshit is holding back entire human race from its true potential.

6194 2018-08-10 18:06:20 Let’s face it. Trump is using the pastor for his own agenda. He needs an excuse to break US relations with Turkey. Turkey’s allies are Russia and Iran. I’m sure it has to be because of what’s going on with oil interests and Israel. It’s not about the pastor.
6195 2018-08-10 18:06:16 They’re pretty easy to get rid of, I had one almost constantly but putting some tea tree oil on it got rid of it. You just have to be careful to not actually get it in the hole. Because that hurts like a bitch
6196 2018-08-10 18:06:16 The oil fields were discovered recently and located inside #Ethiopia .
Export is not yet started but as a friendly country  #UAE is extending a helping hand in bldg a pipeline to Asab #Eritrea. Don't hesitate to ask me more questions, if you have any.
6197 2018-08-10 18:05:56 Dad walks by my car - “you need to get the oil changed and rotate the tires” how do they know that?!

6199 2018-08-10 18:05:33 Canada lashes out at Saudis but can't back up their words with actions, like not buying their oil.  Other countries refuse to support Canada in this ecause they are wise enough to realize they can't/won't back up their words either

6205 2018-08-10 18:05:02 Sound bites like this from a Federal Leader show a lack of national vision. Pipeline encumbrances abound. Energy East, Doubling Pipelines to pacific are in the national interest. Oil business in Canada is under great scrutiny. Trudeau & Singh come across as foolish bumblers.

6209 2018-08-10 18:04:35 I'm no geologist, but surely you could repurpose old oil rigs, move them to south of Iceland and drill/generate geothermal energy from there? No? I guess you'd need a long cable back to the UK....

6217 2018-08-10 18:03:59 Adding to the original convo, we usually fry them in either sunflower seed oil or olive oil. I prefer them done with olive oil and they only taste potato-y if uncooked.

6219 2018-08-10 18:03:33 identity precedes mission. Most churches have thousand spent on their mission statement and still have no idea of their unique identity. @jimhennesy ‘s latest “fresh oil” sermon is great for understanding this

6227 2018-08-10 18:03:02 1. The pipeline would connect Assab to Addis; oil goes from the port to the capital city. This makes the process more efficient, reduces cost in the long run, and reduces emissions from all those tankers currently doing the job.
2. Ogaden is in Ethiopia, right?

6232 2018-08-10 18:02:31 Read the Ap 2016 NASA article and it says although Carbon Dioxide increases photosynthesis, CD is still the chief culprit of climate change and that it’s bc of burning oil, gas, coal and wood...impact of which includes rising sea levels, etc...
6233 2018-08-10 18:02:31 Our nation can and should replace imported oil from Saudi Arabia? Well, that goes without saying...

Screw the Saudis and time to exert Canadian power! Saudi Arabia is a nothing burger and should be put back into their place. And with extreme prejudice.

6240 2018-08-10 18:01:16 Yup. Just had to order oil. Paid $100.00 more than in the spring for the same amount. Hoping this winter will be unseasonably warm or I'm going to freeze. New England winters can be bitter cold. #TraitorTrumpIsTheEnemyOfThePeople

6243 2018-08-10 18:00:43 What you aren’t understanding is WHY they’ve caused the damage.  To fulfill the wants/needs of the public.  If we didn’t all use oil/plastics/rubber/gas, etc., there would be no need to drill.  This need doesn’t disappear by ending capitalism

6257 2018-08-10 17:58:19 "Another piece of the puzzle is the relationship China is trying to establish with Iran. China wants to import more Iranian oil but does not wish to run afoul of U.S. sanctions on Iran set to resume in November"

6259 2018-08-10 17:58:17 Definitely! But worth trying a facial oil, they’re often multi purpose too
6260 2018-08-10 17:58:16 The NDP government in Alberta does support both pipelines you mentioned and the Trans mountain is going ahead. As far as energy east goes maybe the pipeline blockers in the east will wise up and accept our oil with all the Saudi bullshit going on. Fed. NDP have no voice anyway.
6261 2018-08-10 17:58:16 "Venezuela is not a monetary sovereign like the US is.  It owes debts in foreign currency and relies on oil reserves to make those payments."

Which debts would be paid if it had not gone socialist and ruined its economy.

6264 2018-08-10 17:57:36 We should be able to purchase our oil needs from other sources.
6265 2018-08-10 17:57:20 Recently 3 bears were murdered in Alaska result of endangering wildlife in Alaska. The trump administration is now wanting to drill more oil more mining and getting rid of the endangered species act this is wrong please think about the future it is our only planet earth
6266 2018-08-10 17:57:17 Even the local oil from Alberta is way to expensive, and that is because Alberta is a greedy province that only thinks about itself. Canadians should be buying oil at the same price as in the USA. So if buying foreign oil means getting it for cheaper let it be. #CanadiansFirst
6267 2018-08-10 17:57:11 i got an oil defuserrrrrr
6268 2018-08-10 17:57:07 To cut long story short, Nigeria's ext. reserves go where Brent oil price goes.

6275 2018-08-10 17:56:47 Those forecasting Pakistan disintegration in near future have been selling snake oil to public. Pakistan will play a pivotal role in next great war.
6276 2018-08-10 17:56:43 The oil news was fake. Exxon does not have any licence in that area. They have been given license recently alongwith four other firms for offshore drilling. Looks like we will be listening lots of fake news in the coming days.

6284 2018-08-10 17:55:42 On collective denial: just grab a shot of apple cider vinegar, put coconut oil in your hair and add some turmeric to your face cream.

It will all be fine. Really.
6285 2018-08-10 17:55:42 Watermelon and feta cheese salad. Add some good olive oil and lime juice, plus chopped mint or lemon balm, a bit of black pepper.
6286 2018-08-10 17:55:32 Fed NDP leader @theJagmeetSingh suggesting Canada purchase our oil elsewhere than Saudi. Yep! That'll show 'em.  Alternate suggestion: Let's undercut Saudi price and sell our oil to their clients at a discount.
6287 2018-08-10 17:55:31 god fucking dammit I put on a bug spray because there were mosquitoes in my room and the sheer fucking density of the oil in the spray has goddamn stained my favourite bracelet I use to calm down and now it's all wrong I'm so fucking gutted

6307 2018-08-10 17:52:40 I'd have thought that the Saudis would be the last people to invest in an electric car. Their oil sales would plummet. They'd be more likely to buy it outright and put it in the big room at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, along with water powered cars etc (tinfoil hat :-) )
6308 2018-08-10 17:52:28 Yes I have allot of Questions when did Ethiopia became an Oil Exporter? And Where are those Oil fields located?

6338 2018-08-10 17:48:48 How would you deal with shutting down oil imports from Saudi Arabia? In an ideal world, we would use green energy, but most of us aren't there yet .. the NDP platform calls for the elimination of subsidies to the fossil-fuel industry & investment in clean energy .. #cdnpoli

6363 2018-08-10 17:45:10 @theJagmeetSingh you realize that oil imported from other nations are most likely transported through oil tankers like the Exxon Valdez, which are more environmentally unfriendly than pipeline oil.

Why not introduce a In Canada solution to the Saudi controversy?

6395 2018-08-10 17:41:02 Have you ventured in? We really liked it!  I am excited by their endeavour to rid all of their products of palm oil.
6396 2018-08-10 17:41:01 He's literally said he can do better than what ML is doing so that should definitely be taken into consideration by anyone, especially with all the direct accusations he's made towards Rony Abovitz of being a snake oil salesman. Glass houses and such.
6397 2018-08-10 17:40:56 So to be clear, neither the NDP nor the Liberal politicians really have a say in where oil is purchased. Last I checked, they don't get a say UNLESS they sit on the Irving Oil Board that makes a business decision on who the supplier will be.
6398 2018-08-10 17:40:53 Bring the oil,scented candles and massage table,hands will be put to work at an affordable fee
6399 2018-08-10 17:40:53 Oil prices are too volatile. Their exclusion however means CPI is less informative about cost of living.
6400 2018-08-10 17:40:51 Short term we need oil. That is a realty. I don't like it but we can't ignore it

6412 2018-08-10 17:39:45 Hahah Really? Is this a real question? Simple Answer: Both the #Saudis (#Oil) & #Zionists of #Israel own America. They are all in our hypocritical #Congress spewing their corrupt policies. And every #POTUS is required to be the lapdog of Israel. #Facts.
6413 2018-08-10 17:39:40 They're so afraid of Saudi and its oil, they can only say words like 'concerned'. Imagine if it was Assad doing such a thing, there would be an outcry, rightly, and Trump would be red faced with rage. Instead, nothing from him. Complicit by his silence.
6414 2018-08-10 17:39:38 Hmm. You do know that the Canadian Government (Trudeau) doesn't buy oil. Saudi oil is purchased by private companies like Irving Oil to fill their refineries. Are you saying you wish for a NEP 2.0 to force companies to buy only what the Government dictates?
6415 2018-08-10 17:39:25 But we didn't see the BALCO™ Flaxseed Oil Experience, at least from the Gnats' side.
6416 2018-08-10 17:39:14 I kinda thought that was the idea of energy East... Anyway, if we're gonna use oil, which we are, we might as well use our own.

6424 2018-08-10 17:38:53 You don't have to make a big deal about it. Some people have all these rules to maximize the compost you get out of it. I just want to keep all the stuff out of the trash. I have a bin. I throw old food in it (no meat or oil) and it magically disappears with no muss or fuss.
6425 2018-08-10 17:38:38 Don’t brush your hair ! Just run your fingers thru it with some oil or hair hydrator. Brushing it makes it dry puffy.

6446 2018-08-10 17:36:36 Post it notes?! I use them a lot! The teabags are a great idea. Perhaps some bath oil (if they have access to a bath!) Maybe tissues, for inevitable coughs and colds. And perhaps Berocca (or supermarket equivalent!)
6447 2018-08-10 17:36:36 That's what happens when the car has too much oil, all the excess oil goes from the piston to the exhaust headers then causes detonation and foaming in the cylinders.
6448 2018-08-10 17:36:32 I understood it when Oil was over $100 a barrel. But where we are right now? It should be government policy to buy from our refineries not international ones.

6463 2018-08-10 17:34:57 @theJagmeetSingh I got an awesome idea to this Saudi spat you politicians felt you needed to start.  How about we just use oil from Canada instead of sourcing it from other countries? I really don't know how you guys get into power...

6473 2018-08-10 17:34:17 We are selling our own oil for $30 a barrel. But buying foreign oil at market prices. It really makes no sense. We should be using 100% of our resources and not selling it for a steep discount...
6474 2018-08-10 17:34:03 As for an "affordable" solution or alternative. You know how you get it? By funneling money into technology to do so, not the dying industries that you'd eventually like to leave behind. And you'd cripple half of our enemies...  The generally profit on oil.
6475 2018-08-10 17:33:56 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles!

6490 2018-08-10 17:31:54 Yes!  Pick up a lb, cut in halves or quarters if they're big, throw in a ziplock bag, add olive oil, fresh minced garlic (or garlic powder), salt, pepper...smoosh them around.

6515 2018-08-10 17:29:03 Remember "it's all bullshit" this is well staged by Trudeau and the Saudi's to entice the oil companies back to the oil patch thus paying notley's carbon tax, increasing public and private employment. They're both up for re-election next year.

6548 2018-08-10 17:25:47 Ambazonia IG got terms of negotiation for a peaceful goodbye. Ambaz made GZ ungovernable so much that LRC is scrawling together with France&Britain as babies. They can sign the oil deals as they like, nothing will work in Ambaland. GZ is GZ.  GOD Bless Mr Lee

6550 2018-08-10 17:25:41 You are again wrong as usual since Erdogan is NOT an allay he is the supporter of #ISIS. He is a dictator more than anything else.  You guys in #EU have a policy of supporting dictatorship in #Iran, mullahs, and #Turkey for $$$ and oil. You hypocrites.  Shame on you.
6551 2018-08-10 17:25:40 It's for self pleasure
6552 2018-08-10 17:25:31 China claims: "China's lawful rights should be protected." Beijing buys around $15 billion worth of crude oil from Iran annually as Tehran's top energy customer.
6553 2018-08-10 17:25:30 Pakistanis helped develop all they have, we were much better than them, driving cars and they rode camels, all changed when oil was discovered. Today they killed innocent 29 school going kids.
6554 2018-08-10 17:25:28 Yes maybe they can be heard now since they were the first people here. It's ashamed what they've done at the oil lines and land property. She's tough though.
6555 2018-08-10 17:25:19 It's only going to get worse there is a glut of oil in the world
6556 2018-08-10 17:25:14 .@jack  siphoned off Twitter profits and used them to illegally buy and sell oil from the Islamic State on the black market in 2015-2017. I have proof. I have documents. I have videos. Prove me wrong, @jack . Prove you aren't a material sponsor of terrorism.

6558 2018-08-10 17:25:13 Do you think oil companies in Canada will stop selling oil for huge profits outside Canada in favour of only providing oil in Canada?

6565 2018-08-10 17:23:28 Nice piece @SamiGrover 
My company uses Exxon beads for manufacturing of plastic industrial parts. Oil fluctuation & demand for plastics definitely can be seen in the oil & plastics market and affect our industry’s decisions. This piece is spot on 
6566 2018-08-10 17:23:25 Don’t give into this regime and it’s oppressive actions, tell them to shove their oil and make sure all the students return to their country

6568 2018-08-10 17:22:54 current russian situation is most puzzling to all economists - with high prices on oil (±$70) #Putin juicing out every penny from people(all taxes raised statewide) for what? No one knows, maybe for their #war #USA & #EU in 2020-30s, they already have congolese #Ebola samples.

6574 2018-08-10 17:21:41 This is oil money while the south south suffers pollution marginalized and militarization. The core Northern enjoy what doesn’t belong to them. I don’t care what reactions is gonna bring but the truth hurts

6576 2018-08-10 17:21:37 So far so good! I rinsed it off, pat it dry, let it sit out for about an hour, scored the fat, rubbed the spices and a tiny bit of olive oil, put it in a roasting pan on a rack, 500° in the for 20 minutes and then down to 275° Thank you so much again for your help!

6598 2018-08-10 17:19:07 Go ahead and support OPEC! Thank you for your service, as someone who serves, it amazes me that you don’t understand that our servicemen die protecting our oil interests around the world!
6599 2018-08-10 17:19:06 How comes the cost of fuel is expensive here compared to Uganda and yet Uganda imports it's crude oil thru either TZ or Kenya? Taxes on crude oil is so high. This taxes ends up in looters pockets.

6603 2018-08-10 17:18:45 Saudi coalition rockets school bus.  Let's buy our oil from someone else.
6604 2018-08-10 17:18:45 Saudi Arabia bans all trade with Canada over a TWEET. But, of course, they don’t stop the sale of oil, because they can’t afford anything without it’s trade. It’s honestly embarrassing, a bunch of pussies.
6605 2018-08-10 17:18:39 Also reopening the Keystone pipeline turned America from a oil importing nation to an oil exporting nation. I know people in ND they don't have enough housing for all the jobs they have out there. Even you, have to admit, Trump is doing great things for our Economy.

6608 2018-08-10 17:18:08 The recipe (and there isn't one) is throw a little oil down, get the shallots and garlic doing their thing. Find green stuff in the fridge (kale, arugula, collards, chard). Add lumpier stuff (bok choy, tofu, zucchini, broccoli), spice, toast the almonds last. :)
6609 2018-08-10 17:17:59 How long do think it will take before companies like @McDonalds go back to frying their fries in tallow? I remember how much better they tasted before “healthy oil”  were forced on us.
6610 2018-08-10 17:17:58 No source, it was the bull's conclusion after Tesla said MS' boss is a fan, so it couldn't be 'big oil' anymore. MS stopped tweeting and writing, so they decided it was because he did this on company time, unknown to his boss... It's a stupid argument, but its what they have.
6611 2018-08-10 17:17:55 Even though the Britain makes more money from selling Scotland's oil, than is made in the whole of Saudi Arabia? Even though the McCrone report (ordered, and then suppressed, by the UK government) was highly favourable of an independent Scotland due to our natural resources?
6612 2018-08-10 17:17:51 The main reason of the recession was simply the collapse of the oil price in 2014 and dependency on export of hydrocarbons.

One can sit in a car, get stuck in a traffic jam & crib about the condition instead of demanding and using public transport. No city can be designed for personal transport for routines. We are resource short & import oil

6630 2018-08-10 17:15:42 Otw to get my oil changed
6631 2018-08-10 17:15:40 I'm kinda simple. I used japanese sesame oil plus a little (very little) soy sauce, plus fresh ground salt and just a little bit of fresh ground red pepper flakes. (To be completely transparent, I used too much oil.)
6632 2018-08-10 17:15:39 I do a simple marinade I make lol vinegar, salt,pepper, garlic, onion, rosemary, and olive oil and let it set for about a day or at least 4-5 hours in the fridge
Jerk is really good too! The lamb really holds flavor

6634 2018-08-10 17:15:28 Harnn, don't you have an orange massage oil on an online shop? No more this product line? It's good to my skin especially when an allergic symptom is not so good. I used it before.
6635 2018-08-10 17:15:26 Canada should've been buying oil fr. smaller suppliers - helping their economy vs most popular one in the market but I say no to pipelines- time to stop depending on fossil fuels- look f. alternative innovations
6636 2018-08-10 17:15:23 The pour-over is awesome. I still buy paper filters to limit the oil from the coffee grounds, though. It can raise your LDL cholesterol.

6644 2018-08-10 17:14:05 That barge has crushed cars on it.  Tires burning, remnants of gasoline and oil, among other things...not good.
6645 2018-08-10 17:14:01 you have to buy pasta. put some water to boil in a pot. when it boils, add salt and then pasta. Meanwhile, put oil, garlic and tomatoes in a pan. after 8 minutes drain the pasta and put it in the pan. a minute and you can eat
6646 2018-08-10 17:14:01 Hey @theJagmeetSingh I know where we can buy our oil from.  How about Alberta.  You might of heard of it.
6647 2018-08-10 17:13:57 Valerian root & melatonin are a great combo! There’s a supplement on amazon I think is called Drift Off? Also Yogi tea makes a blend called Bedtime with Valerian and it’s great. Diffusing lavender helps me, as does CBD oil.
6648 2018-08-10 17:13:55 Nanticoke is IOR and they were one of the ones to get the line between Montreal and Sarnia reversed to get offshore oil.  It was again reversed when WTI was over $100USD while WCS was under $70CD

6674 2018-08-10 17:10:31 I believe #facts dude. And #drumpf is a racist clown making racist policies. Stems all the way back to his father and his involvement with the KKK. 

You can’t change your mind bc it would admit either 1) you voted for a racist snake oil salesman or 2) you’re afraid to be wrong
6675 2018-08-10 17:10:29 Kylie really has someone waiting to dab the sweat/oil off her face when she’s out. Idk if I’m jealous of her or the person w that job bc I’m sure he makes more than me

6683 2018-08-10 17:09:58 For UK, Business is everything. Selling arms to Saudia or dealing over dead bodies of Egyptian for oil.
6684 2018-08-10 17:09:50 Lol udokaa Your cousin GEJ was a very good  spender. The economy was IN near collapse b4 he left. Massive debts, UNPAID fradulent subsidy claims.Near empty reserves & 70%decline in oil prices, States cannot pay salaries.2 wars. ill-equipped military etc PMB saved us from the mess
6685 2018-08-10 17:09:46 Canada is a rival oil exporting country against Saudi Arabia.
6686 2018-08-10 17:09:41 Conservatives don't even believe in Global Warming. Half of Conservatives don't even think the Earth is more than 6,000 years old. And if Conservatives wanted to help, they would ditch coal, oil etc, instead of propping up dying industries...
6687 2018-08-10 17:09:31 U.S. #RigCount, according to @BHGECO
#oil rigs 869, +10

6688 2018-08-10 17:09:31 True cost and pollution of grid connected wind/solar is the cost of wind/solar + the cost/pollution of whatever conventional generation is used to back it up.  It will *always* cost significantly more than conventional generation (nuke, hydraulic, gas, coal, oil, etc)
6689 2018-08-10 17:09:23 Money talks Steve, but that lot are the worst humans on the planet. It’s a shame they have oil.
6690 2018-08-10 17:09:19 @zeibars Pax America will spend a lot more than obor protecting Turkey and the Chinese know this.   Us needs to cut off Bosporus, cut off Iran oil buyer, and protect against a port in tartus Syria.
6691 2018-08-10 17:09:18 Not expand the oil sands? Not export one the worlds most carbon intensive energy sources? Maximize royalties to transition to a low carbon economy? 

Let me know when you get serious.

6693 2018-08-10 17:09:09 Crude oil price was at $59/bbl in 2014. Now that it is $72.07/bbl what has @MBuhari done with the money? Oh let me guess, saving it for 2019 elections right? They plan to pay N5,000 per voter like they did in ekiti.. Hypocrite govt.

6696 2018-08-11 23:59:24 Just eat a handful of cornmeal and chase it with a shot of oil.
6697 2018-08-11 23:59:16 Problem with your analysis is that the drop in the Ruble has matched the drop in oil prices, which was primary driver.  Secondary is that the US dollar has strengthened by around 30% v most major currencies during that time.  All independent of Crimea.
6698 2018-08-11 23:59:03 I want as much oil as possible and dried too.

6704 2018-08-11 23:57:31 So, does vegan food "stink" (like, literally smell bad) to those who aren't vegan? Ex: Diaya macaroni and cheese. I know it's not the healthiest vegan food, but it doesn't stink to me. My bf on the other hand, says it smells bad. The cheese is coconut oil and pea protein.
6705 2018-08-11 23:57:09 wash her up, oil her body each and every part , cuddle naked on the sofa and cover yourselves with a light sheet , she will fall asleep in a minute
6706 2018-08-11 23:57:08 It’s like a snake oil salesman saying that his competitors are selling fake potions.
6707 2018-08-11 23:56:53 Don’t forget  we dumb enough to keep buying their oil as well.

6709 2018-08-11 23:56:46 I can't believe that one of my residents came to my room again until he was telling me to put the green oil on my hair while he was standing in front of me to brush my hair with the red hairbrush really hard after he started cursing and very mean to me like that!!!

6730 2018-08-11 23:56:03 your no oil painting
6731 2018-08-11 23:56:03 I don't know why anyone would want electric cars to fail. Especially oil companies, with immense resources, who have never ever tried to do anything to hinder tech that hurts their profits.
6732 2018-08-11 23:55:37 Wjen i start making money first thing im buying is nontoxic oil paints
6733 2018-08-11 23:55:32 Here is a just CAUSE for you and eternity. LIBERTY  AND FREEDOM for Hebrew Biafra the origin of most Black  Americans. From SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE for oil and gas to British Govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. Demand REFERENDUM .
6734 2018-08-11 23:55:15 Lamb is the most incredible meat for me. I roast it to a point where the fat starts melting and thats it! Rosemary, Olive Oil and Grain Mustard  rub! And Pita  bread!
6735 2018-08-11 23:54:54 Yeah, I’ve never understood this fawning over Russia, a two-bit oligarchy with just oil and nukes.
6736 2018-08-11 23:54:51 You out here willingly drinking pine oil? Sheesh.. couldn’t be me

6738 2018-08-11 23:54:49 Yeah, well the majority who voted didn't really think the snake oil salesman currently running our country couldn't get voted in either. But here we are.

6741 2018-08-11 23:54:25 Baby oil dah cukup 
6742 2018-08-11 23:54:19 I honestly didn't even realize that Jerry Falwell was still alive. I get all the grifting, snake oil Bible Thumpers confused.
6743 2018-08-11 23:54:07 besides you have to have priorities. Cake trumps oil anytime.
6744 2018-08-11 23:54:04 I remember that James Bond movie where the bad guys are chasing him in his Aston Martin and he thwarts them by use of an oil slick deployed from the rear of the car. Yeah, like that.
6745 2018-08-11 23:54:01 sunflower seed oil and creme of nature leave in conditioner
6746 2018-08-11 23:54:01 Junior, don’t you dare use the word integrity here, you and your father have made draining the savings accounts of those who can least afford it your life’s work,  and endorsements from snake oil shamans like you helped put the king of the grifters in the White House.
6747 2018-08-11 23:53:56 you're cleansing the oil from the us with fresh ph air
6748 2018-08-11 23:53:53 How's the humidity in your house? If it's not too bad, I'd hang. Adding heat to dry herbs leaches out some of the oil.
6749 2018-08-11 23:53:42 زيت الذرة معمول من الذرة ، و زيت عباد الشمس معمول من زهرة عباد الشمس، طيب الbaby oil معمول من ايه؟
6750 2018-08-11 23:53:36 It also suits him financially, he is heavily invested in oil and coal.
6751 2018-08-11 23:53:27 Time se oil lagana chaiye tha 
6752 2018-08-11 23:52:50 You still look lovely babe but you’ll get there! Xxx I have some cbd oil if u want some to sleep on a night
6753 2018-08-11 23:52:20 That's from my custom which I just watched and i think it's the best video I've ever seen! Soo much oil on those soles, ridiculously good! 
6754 2018-08-11 23:52:19 damn went n got my oil changed, left a box of condoms in the door. old dude gave me my key back w a nasty look stfu w ur std havin ass
6755 2018-08-11 23:52:15 This also avoids the right wing strat of having some right winger of color claim that the white left wing pundit across the desk “is the real racist”
6756 2018-08-11 23:52:09 Oil extract edildikten sonra bir producta katıldıysa zararlı gibi anladım. Yoksa hem çiçek hali hem kurusu kullanıyor mutfakta hatta "culinary lavender" diye bir alt tür de üretilmiş. C.L aroma olarakdaha uygun ancak diğer lavanta türleri de kullanılabilir diyor tariflerde
6757 2018-08-11 23:51:46 No - I don't think it is that. They've added something that shouldn't be there. They tried to add palm oil to their blocks without telling anyone, but spontaneously received 10s of 1000's of complaints about the taste, so they removed it again.
6758 2018-08-11 23:51:41 Do you use gun oil as lube?
6759 2018-08-11 23:51:40 He sells oil to Israel,  kills fellow Kurdish Ummah brothers in Syria, even threatens to invade Iraq n create dams which prevent water in to Iraq/Syria. Wtf are you talking about?

6763 2018-08-11 23:50:01 Yeah, but he was playing with dudes named Oil Can, which is not too dissimilar with Hogan only wrestling John Tenta and Dave Sullivan.

6765 2018-08-11 23:49:34 Vasilia shook her head, "no, no Olive Oil is not animal! Other places is not Kalokairi Michelle." But then she did have a point, Kalokairi was becoming slightly more popular with tourists recently which could only be a good thing. You have? >
6766 2018-08-11 23:49:25 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
6767 2018-08-11 23:49:23 It has already, since 2014. The oil price was a lie (in any case its revenue that matters). Now oil is costing us, because it’s too expensive to extract. Scotland doesn’t raise enough in tax, for our expensive public services, and all the “free” stuff!
6768 2018-08-11 23:49:02 I wuz gonna say Amazon but they're out of stock. Do you have a World Market nearby? They've got it too. I'm apparently surrounded by truffle oil dealers in my neck of the woods.
6769 2018-08-11 23:48:42 The UAW and the Koch Bros have me working OT for cash documenting all the theories on TMC. Haven’t heard from Big Coal or Big Oil yet, can you DM me? $tsla #tesla

6773 2018-08-11 23:48:20 Omigosh, she’s just the cutest little baby!  Look into CDB Oil by Pet Releaf.   I have my 4 lb, 14 year old chi on it and she’s so much more comfortable.  She suffers from seizures, we’ve been able to cut back on meds w the oil.

6778 2018-08-11 23:46:41 I think I seen an article saying one school taught how to change car oil, fix a flat tire then taught balancing money.
6779 2018-08-11 23:46:33 Nanny said “spray some of that oil in there and shut the dang door” to Mason 
6780 2018-08-11 23:46:30 Actually, nature arranged that system. That may explain why the Cheeto appointed a coal lobbyist as head of the EPA and a man who sat on the board of an oil pipeline co. and founded a land mgmt./business development consulting  co. as Sec of Interior. Conflict of interest anyone?
6781 2018-08-11 23:46:27 It's not even 8 o'clock and there is a middle aged couple sucking face so hard at the bar, I've got a 21 year old punisher to my left, and I had to kick a crazy man out for dropping the n word... How's yer new moon?
6782 2018-08-11 23:46:07 We need someone to govern, not more macho posturing bullshit.
Leave it to our media to get suckered by another white male celebrity candidate's snake oil salesmanship while ignoring anyone with substance and policy chops.
6783 2018-08-11 23:45:54 Im gonna miss you so bad.
6784 2018-08-11 23:45:50 Ironic that our wood, our concrete, our plastic made from our oil is now costing thousands more.  However, insurance is covering all of it as long as they are insured and thousands of dollars on a 3-700,000 homes really isn’t a big deal.
6785 2018-08-11 23:45:45 Oh, sure!  I bet your even get your oil changed before the warning light goes on, Mr. Vehiculiar-Than-Thou!
6786 2018-08-11 23:45:43 My parents took my car to get an oil change came back with it all clean and a full tank of gas  god bless them

6796 2018-08-11 23:42:58 My missus has CBD oil (2%) for her e-cigarette vape thing. Also, I go on vacation to Cartama, Southern Spain, where they grow it & bottle it themselves. It’s quite potent. 

I can’t smoke it anymore either - one puff & I get lost on a 500yd walk home from my friends house!
6797 2018-08-11 23:42:55 There's a really good oil store (no joke) in the Woodlands Mall.

6807 2018-08-11 23:41:41 Ano yung nakita ko. Pota
6808 2018-08-11 23:41:37 These oil companies are leaner, and more profitable, at current depressed prices. They trimmed the fat and compete on a global level successfully. Prices go up they will do very well. Sector was bloated back in 13/14, I was in staffing and had heard from hr managers all over YYC
6809 2018-08-11 23:41:32 Well all I need to do now is the farm the oil barrels and I would have cleared the shop.  I’ll be QP grinding and summer servant bond farming. Starting tomorrow.
6810 2018-08-11 23:41:17 If the propose arrangement of giving out a oil well to each state sail through, we can hope for many "Californias" economy to spring up among the Nigeria states.
6811 2018-08-11 23:41:15 Bakit ganon! Wait laaaaaaaang
6812 2018-08-11 23:41:09 Black seed oil?
6813 2018-08-11 23:41:00 
6814 2018-08-11 23:41:00 Excited to watch tonight’s games (love football), but in the meantime- grilling corn, aspersgus, steaks and sausages. I also am baking Greek briami - eggplant, zuchs, potatoes, onion, tomato and garlic w/ oil and fresh herbs.  And again, watching football- even the replay game.
6815 2018-08-11 23:40:57 I fixed my skin tone and baby enzo skin tone. I am much happier now with the result.. Me on Acrylic painting and Baby Enzo is on Oil Painting.... — feeling accomplished. — feeling accomplished
6816 2018-08-11 23:40:51 If you’re serious about standing up to Riyadh, how come you are stilling giving their oil a free pass? How come you have exempted it from your upcoming carbon tax and are not subjecting Saudi oil to the same environmental regulations you have imposed on Western Canadian oil?
6817 2018-08-11 23:40:48 Rapeseed oil is like a huge thing, it can be used as fuel etc the grow tones of it in scotland
6818 2018-08-11 23:40:48 And stop paying rent/mortgage. Get an old bus, van, rv, travel trailer, or build your own trailer/camper with diesel engine & convert to run on veggie oil. Use solar power, compost toilet, DIY water filtering/purifying & travel debt free & connect with others living that life.

6821 2018-08-11 23:40:28 Plan for the rest of the evening:

*Take a shower. It's humid and I feel like an oil slick. 
*Go get an Andy's Frozen Custard. 
*Start the stream with Episode 3, Season 2 of TWD. 
*Sub night:  Subs, you get to decide what to play with me! 

See ya at around 8:30PM Central!

6823 2018-08-11 23:40:18 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
6824 2018-08-11 23:40:14 We let all our strategic partners commit atrocities as long as they've got oil to share and money to buy weapons. 
We do not allow atrocities if they refuse to share the oil or can't support out #MilitaryIndustrialComplex 
It's REALLY complicated...except it's really not.
6825 2018-08-11 23:39:52 Snake oil salesman working here.

6827 2018-08-11 23:39:39 I’m just not deep conditioning my hair. I pre poo’d my hair with olive oil to de tangle as well & my hair was SUPER soft after shampooing
6828 2018-08-11 23:39:35 Mike drop on David Clarke! Beautiful Michael, just beautiful! And this clown has the audacity to call YOU a snake oil salesman! Little projection you think?
6829 2018-08-11 23:39:25 opposes the commencement  of crude  oil production  in the region with it's  statement that  folllowed the news and the reality on the Ground.
6830 2018-08-11 23:39:11 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
6831 2018-08-11 23:39:02 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
6832 2018-08-11 23:38:46 I love how people still deny climate change when oil companies don't even deny it anymore OR the fact that they knew about it. Motherfucker, they admitted they were lying to you, what are you doing?
6833 2018-08-11 23:38:29 I asked my Grandaddy for his skin care routine and he start pulling out his products including his bear oil and cologne... talking bout get it for ya man

6838 2018-08-11 23:38:12 Interesting is it not. Saudi oil still the preferred one over Canadian oil.
6839 2018-08-11 23:38:09 just had a very intense, passionate conversation about coconut oil with the man ahead of me in the checkout line @ the market and tbh this is very similar to how I’ve always imagined I’ll meet the love of my life
6840 2018-08-11 23:38:07 But there’s just no room for a bloke slathered in baby oil and wearing lederhosen in our relationship.
6841 2018-08-11 23:38:05 This isn't ABSOLVING the Venezuelan govt, but a LOT of the criticism levelled at them either isn't true, or is something they were attempting to fix. (reliance on oil, for instance. They WERE trying to diversity, but that shit takes time)
Mixing valid criticism w/ vitriol is bad.
6842 2018-08-11 23:37:53 Gr8, I'll get teh coconut oil.
6843 2018-08-11 23:37:00 A little oil in her food to loosen it up?

6860 2018-08-11 23:33:46 Ask him he ever took a 4am call from Trump 5 weeks ago and agreed to increase oil production.
6861 2018-08-11 23:33:35 Service time, service time and more service time, It really is too bad baseball works like this
6862 2018-08-11 23:33:04 @potus has:
1 Encouraged oil & gas production, costing Vlad money
2 Strengthened the military and kill 300 Rus. mercenaries
3 Strengthened Rus. sanctions

6867 2018-08-11 23:32:26 This is the same Tom Perez and DNC voting to accept oil money, specifically citing the loss in fundraising as a result of Janus? That DNC?
6868 2018-08-11 23:31:58 It is kinda weird how people do this for every dish. Most rice is low starch so it's barely noticeable unless you're doing something like marinated rice for sushi. Out of curiosity, do you add any butter or oil to basmati when you cook it?
6869 2018-08-11 23:31:56 Hey buddy. You stupid or something? “Barry Bonds admits using steroids during his baseball career, his lawyer told a jury Tuesday. The catch is that Bonds’s personal trainer misled him into believing he was taking flaxseed oil and arthritis cream.”
6870 2018-08-11 23:31:55 Def Leppard’s guitarist just came out shirtless and completely slicked in oil. I mean, kind of unfair, no?

If I started an appearance like that, I’d have fans too.

6874 2018-08-11 23:31:22 Ah right... yeah JRM and other Brextremists peddling “how to dodge the fallout of Brexit” snake oil. Saw the thread. Thanks. I get the Hargreaves-Lansdown one a lot.

6879 2018-08-11 23:30:45 Diet reminders: eat oily fish twice a week and take a fish oil supplement on every other day.
6880 2018-08-11 23:30:42 Standard Oil was a monopoly, because we needed oil for heat and transportation, things that are absolutely imperative to having any sort of quality of life. Nobody needs YouTube, it’s entertainment, and again, it’s free.
6881 2018-08-11 23:30:40 I need my oil changed ericcccck

6884 2018-08-11 23:30:34 There is no queue. Scotland meets ALL requirements of EU membership. Spain have said they would not veto (i assume this is what you are inferring). Why would the EU throw out a country with the largest oil reserves in the EU ? It would also be our choice whether to join or not
6885 2018-08-11 23:29:52 Just made the yummiest summer salad: garden greens, cucumber, blue berries, green onion, avocado chunks, pumpkin seeds and fresh mint, drizzled with olive oil and apple cider vinegar, sprinkled with lavender and salt. Fresh, light, juicy, slightly sweet, herby yumminess! 
6886 2018-08-11 23:29:44 It will be sufficient to pipe bitumen to Pacific tidewater to sell to the Chinese. Export dollars are better than complaints from Canadians that they are being ripped of for paying for their own oil. Besides, we're getting off oil...remember? #cdnpoli
6887 2018-08-11 23:29:33 Hubby was watching a mousetrap enthusiast on YouTube. Dude put peanut oil in a container and the mice got in but got slimy and couldn't get out. So, we are thinking. Can we do something similar in the yard of the rat hole house from hell?

6895 2018-08-11 23:26:46 Yeah but if you change your own oil you get to keep the oil.
6896 2018-08-11 23:26:42 Ehn ehn, waooo I don't know they now use oil.

6905 2018-08-11 23:25:16 I used to use coconut oil (the hardened stuff in tubs from the supermarket) melted under warm water. Only works if you're ok smelling of coconut. Incredibly cheap tho.

6907 2018-08-11 23:24:33 Are they training on how to handle oil spills? Once your @GOP strait drilling it will be a necessary skill.

6913 2018-08-11 23:23:34 David was not the most qualified but he got the oil on his head, Moses was   not the most eloquent but he lead the Israelites, it doesn't matter your shortcomings, just make yourself available for God to use you.

That's proof of the effect of climate change action.
6923 2018-08-11 23:21:13 it’s the grease/oil or cheese i think :/ sometimes its fine but other im nauseous and super sad

6929 2018-08-11 23:20:25 I call it Sunna's Wort because as an oil it can be used to both prevent and take the sting out of a sunburn. Though when ingested it can increase ones sensitivity to the sun. Certainly an interesting property.

That's 2 bush cords. Maple is 3,740 pounds per BC.  I usually stack 4.

I heat exclusively with wood and it's worth it. I moved into the home I'm in now 7 years ago and still have over 3/4 of a tank of fuel oil.

I'll be thankful for today in January!
6950 2018-08-11 23:17:02 India eyes increased biofuels to cut oil import
6951 2018-08-11 23:16:55 They wilding. Ima NUPE and will admit that oil is a whole different level of fire
6952 2018-08-11 23:16:40 This is literally me every time an oil change is due 
6953 2018-08-11 23:16:23 Do you know if long time royalty payments to residents from Oil & Gas ended?
6954 2018-08-11 23:16:16 They’re too busy investigating a real criminal. Oh, not you... or at least not yet!  Your fake “healed” snake oil salesman, @realDonaldTrump
6955 2018-08-11 23:16:12 Oh look the snake oil salesman on ABC 
Corrupt Josh Fryedenberg droning on and on and on .
Now he is going to lie about giving Malcolm's mates all that money. 
WOW Josh is going to carry the bag for Mal & #MywifeLucy !
6956 2018-08-11 23:16:01 Eucalyptus oil is heaven
6957 2018-08-11 23:15:56 Lmaoooo, which one is with oil again.........just the normal massage jare.
6958 2018-08-11 23:15:39 Olive oil is the only one that always works for me :-) But that might indicate we're responding to different things - canola oil has me reacting more strongly than pretty much anything.
6959 2018-08-11 23:15:37 they just push their way around here. I have no issue w/ oil wells on our land but we must be paid fairly and not threatened by legal action
6960 2018-08-11 23:15:30 Maple syrup is Canada's 'liquid gold': 13 times more expensive than oil. #funfact
6961 2018-08-11 23:15:23 So at PNK, Nupe juice won over Omega oil
6962 2018-08-11 23:15:21 Oil The organism as a specific to make decisions without subject.

6964 2018-08-11 23:15:02 @jacinda @jamespeshaw @MaramaDavidson @winstonpeters How about govt steps up its stance on fossil fuel & plastic by banning adverts for cars that aren't hybrids/EVs? Petrol is destroying the air & oil/plastic the oceans
We no longer have cigarette ads & they did less harm overall
6965 2018-08-11 23:15:01 A girl comes In with her bf to my store. She’s ask if I can go take a look at her car. I go look at her car and see she’s low on oil. She said her bf had put some in. I asked the bf where. Dumbass guy put the oil in the gas tank. 
6966 2018-08-11 23:14:57 In fact, I'm not sure the oil would be necessary. Could make charcoal gelatin blouses up ahead of time....or a genius could market actual charcoal gummi Bears for rectal insertion.
6967 2018-08-11 23:14:25 Yeeaaapaaa!! Mogbeeee!! u mean full massage with oil n body steaming Waawuu!!
6968 2018-08-11 23:14:07 Lol! That's very morbid but still one of the funniest ideas I have ever heard! You better down a bottle of cooking oil as well. 
6969 2018-08-11 23:14:07 HAHAHAHAHHA 
Says the snake oil salesman
6970 2018-08-11 23:14:00 "The grooviest and craziest things in the world cannot be fondled or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
6971 2018-08-11 23:13:59 I used coconut oil in hopes of getting a darker hair colour... my hair became longer instead 
6972 2018-08-11 23:13:35 Coconut oil traps moisture in the skin & can cause acne. It’s good at removing makeup but not too good for the skin, as it can clog pores. I cant say much without knowing your skin type because SOME people can work with it just fine. I work in skincare too just tryna help.
6973 2018-08-11 23:13:25 Looks too big for anything like that! The fence is in a concrete base 5 foot across, and almost all the soil under that is excavated nightly! Will repack the oil tomorrow and check how much moves by the next morning
6974 2018-08-11 23:13:22 Would cbd oil help her seizures stop ? It’s helped my daughter. No seizures in a month.  Praying for all of you.
6975 2018-08-11 23:13:03 "Natural ingredients like what?" Vasilia asks, "Any Olive Oil? But what are they getting for thirty euro Michelle?"Vasilia questions, still not 100% that Michelle's products would sell in Kalokairi, perhaps to those of a more affluent >
6976 2018-08-11 23:12:37 Essential oil diffusers are just industrial vapes
6977 2018-08-11 23:12:25 I have to go get an oil change but it’s soooo hot :,(
6978 2018-08-11 23:12:25 Couzens, choose yah mates wisely. Don't get pulled back b/c sum 1 does not agree with yah choice to walk da path of Amma and The Most Highs. Oil and water do not mix. Yah hafi set yahself apart. Deese are tough, personal decisions. Please say Palils and ask for guidance.
6979 2018-08-11 23:12:24 Yes ratio of my rx is 1 to 1, so i dont get high. Hemp oil is same
6980 2018-08-11 23:12:24 Thanks for your concern.  We will be fine without a drop of AB dirty oil.
6981 2018-08-11 23:12:22 I'm gonna be off twitter or any social media for a while. I got to try and focus learning for a code test that I still have to retake this Tuesday and I keep freaking the fuck out even though I had 15 drops of cbd+thc oil. So wish me goodluck I guess
6982 2018-08-11 23:12:01 Green Giant would sponsor the Hulk, and BP, or another oil company, would sponsor Lex Luthor
6983 2018-08-11 23:11:41 Somebody cut my hair, deep condition and oil my scalp and braid it up 
6984 2018-08-11 23:11:38 True. Ask ur dr about it. If any feed back. But hemp oil has NO THC IN IT. Its taken out during processing.  Thats why i want it. I dont like feeling high actually. Rather have the benefit without the high
6985 2018-08-11 23:11:37 Monday we have a 3:15 and 4:30 left for the 90 minute special! $75 for the massage and $10 for our new CBD oil enhancement! We also have a few other appointments for the week!

6987 2018-08-11 23:11:09 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
6988 2018-08-11 23:10:46 What did you to to reduce eastern Canada’s dependence on foreign oil Jason? SFA
6989 2018-08-11 23:10:42 Looks like glass. Bio oil as it heals to help with scarring Xx
6990 2018-08-11 23:10:38 I went from smelling like French fries when I got home to smelling like metal and oil when I get home.
Is this an upgrade or?
6991 2018-08-11 23:10:37 I remember being the lone college freshman that was like “guys I don’t think they want blood for oil I think they honestly believe you can shoot democracy into a country”
6992 2018-08-11 23:10:24 I apply coconut oil on the daily and it just makes everything a slip and side when I sit down smh
6993 2018-08-11 23:10:19 オススメデッキください #lov3 #lovfan
6994 2018-08-11 23:10:18 I’m sure my few followers won’t drive out there, and it’s a big lake, and if anything is going to bug them I’m sure it will be the oil rig that went up beside them a week ago.
6995 2018-08-11 23:10:10 True! But the oil must be chilled. During hot weather , it's a challenge to get your charcoal / coconut oil bolus up in there before it turns liquid. Best practice is to have everything mixed and ready ahead of time.
6996 2018-08-11 23:10:03 I paid $32 for some oil for my car who knew this should would be expensive lmao
6997 2018-08-11 23:09:59 If i know anything about Portugal, and I don’t, I am SURE that all the food is GREEN and HEALTHY and certainly not based around fatty pork products and olive oil
6998 2018-08-11 23:09:55 this whole area smells like oil & money and I love it
6999 2018-08-11 23:09:51 My dad took me to the eye doctor, bought me a years worth of contacts followed by Red Lobster. & taking me to get an oil change tomorrow. I feel so loved and blessed .
7000 2018-08-11 23:09:47 I need this Bio Oil to work my nigga I hate scars
7001 2018-08-11 23:09:39 
7002 2018-08-11 23:09:13 Insult if you wish, sir, but the lenses through which you are viewing the world are so thick with social justice oil that they are truly distorting not only basic historical realities, but basic biblical ones as well.
7003 2018-08-11 23:08:42 India eyes increased biofuels to cut oil import
7004 2018-08-11 23:08:29 Exactly. North Dakota’s oil boom has given the state low taxes, and low unemployment. Now they can add toxic farmland to their achievements. Got to love the name of the oil company responsible for the spills. Petro Harvest. How fitting.
7005 2018-08-11 23:08:19 Remember that Alan B’Stard show with Rick Mayall - New Statesman? There was an episode when oil was going to run out so everyone tried to lose the election by being truly fucking awful.
Is that where we are now?
Is everyone intentionally shite so they lose?
7006 2018-08-11 23:08:18 I just perfected my Pico de gallo
Tomatoes, cilantro, onions, hot peppers, chopped garlic and cooked with olive oil, salt pepper. Da best
7007 2018-08-11 23:08:17  you are so amazing man!! But using Olive Oil for you hair.. what a fuck have you done with your singular sailor hat? 
7008 2018-08-11 23:08:09 If we have Friends or not. Why are we still buying Saudi oil?
7009 2018-08-11 23:07:41 War mongering much these days are ya? Wouldn't happen we don't have oil lol
7010 2018-08-11 23:07:16 Barrel of oil /42 gallons = $70
42 gallons maple syrup = $1,428
No point, just trivia
7011 2018-08-11 23:06:49 * Take a small bowl pour some Olive Oil in it, hold it high and ask Father to bless it for Healing and Protection. Take your finger and annoint yourself in Yeshua's precious name.Amen 
* This Father gave to Us, use it. TY Father
7012 2018-08-11 23:06:48 It was as if you were a leaking oil tanker, and she was the vast ocean; and you watched the colored slick of your hopes get lost in her.
7013 2018-08-11 23:06:26 (KJV) Exodus 30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. "El-eh-Yah" OLIVE OIL!
7014 2018-08-11 23:06:19 It's not the oil companies. It's labor unions that sometimes work for them.
7015 2018-08-11 23:06:14 金がないので適当に頑張ります
7016 2018-08-11 23:06:07 Almond oil >>>
7017 2018-08-11 23:05:55 A little oil though. You don't deep fry it in the oil. And you definitely never ever ever pour oil or grease down the drain. Under any circumstances.
7018 2018-08-11 23:05:38 Right now... my car just service.

$800 fi one bokkle a oil and a 5 my car use plus oil filter. 

Not to mention labor, and the air filter did wah change. 

Unuh lowe me lol
7019 2018-08-11 23:05:38 Lol I’m laughing at @AlexErnst video because we both use tea tree oil face wash, and drink apple cider vinegar. I swear on my life those products help!
7020 2018-08-11 23:05:25 The oil boom brought a ton (in North Dakota terms) of mostly white probably conservative voters that may not be so keen on voting for a Democrat. Also in 2012, a big reason why she won was that Indian Country turned out in droves for her and I'm skeptical that can be replicated..
7021 2018-08-11 23:04:49 He has never purchased a car, bought groceries, mowed a lawn, changed the oil, taken a kid to a doctor’s appointment, worried about paying bills when the hot water heater and the fridge go out in the same month.  He doesn’t have a clue about the real world.
7022 2018-08-11 23:04:36 #copl shorts running for Cover next week I’d imagine , not to mention when oil field services deal comes
7023 2018-08-11 23:04:30 Self infatuated snake oil salesman... geez i thought he was referring to @realDonaldTrump there!
7024 2018-08-11 23:04:23 Sweetheart I KNOW what the world is coming to, hatred, bigotry, and oil corps... and none of it is good for anyone. Good thing your grandchildren will have to deal with your decisions as will I and you’ll have no hand in it in about 10 years, love. God bless. 
7025 2018-08-11 23:04:20 I bet the CBD oil works wonderfully too........Moon who happens to bean R.N. 
Would love your feedback.
7026 2018-08-11 23:04:14 What is Th oil?

7027 2018-08-11 23:03:47 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames. Bye spiders!
7028 2018-08-11 23:03:46 Will it freee? I’ve also heard if you mix a natural gelatin in with the coconut oil before chilling it will retain its solidified state longer
7029 2018-08-11 23:03:43 無理しないで、、
7030 2018-08-11 23:03:35 I tried to make my own lip plumper lipgloss once. I used far too much cinnamon oil and nearly burned my mouth off. I can't imagine the pain of using it in more sensitive areas. 
7031 2018-08-11 23:03:24 @CanadianTire store this morning and was told i could not get an oil change. Why because i would not give them my PRIVATE PHONE #.  last time me or my family will be giving canadian tire or any of the other brands like marks who used to get all my work clothing allowance any buiz
7032 2018-08-11 23:03:20 who did this??? 
7033 2018-08-11 23:03:18 Azerbaijan has most of its oil and should be most responsible for its environment and clean up!
7034 2018-08-11 23:03:12 It’s Olive Oil. And I use it for my hair
7035 2018-08-11 23:03:05 Th foolish virgins took their LAMPS & took NO OIL with them: 
Th WISE VIRGINS took OIL in their vessels with their LAMPS
Matthew 25:3, 4. 

What is the lamp? 
Thy WORD is a LAMP unto my feet & a LIGHT unto MY PATH.
Psalm 119:105.

Listen & Learn for your own concern.

7038 2018-08-11 23:02:27 Putting baby oil on fresh out the shower>>>>>>>>>
7039 2018-08-11 23:02:15 Yea I think that's what it is. I haven't tried it. I'm not sure if i would test positive for anything if I used it and I can't risk losing my pain pills for the oil.
7040 2018-08-11 23:02:13 I hear that the only organic way to use this amazing preventative is with coconut oil
7041 2018-08-11 23:02:08 Oil Transactions are made in dollars, If two different countries or corporations want to sell and buy oil from each other; they first convert their currencies into dollars, then do the deal, and convert back; this demand gives our dollar more value which allows us to print somuch
7042 2018-08-11 23:01:59 As a massage therapist, it would be amazing to include CBD oil in massages for sufferers of chronic pain. I hear such brilliant feedback from MT’s in states that allow it in the US.
7043 2018-08-11 23:01:57 Saut shrimp &amp; veggies in 1tbsp of coconut oil &amp; serve over brown rice spaghetti. Delicious &amp; easy 2 make in bulk.
7044 2018-08-11 23:01:56 We Aussies are partly to blame for Cal.fires.
Decades ago shonky Aus. businesses sold greedy American investors millions of gum trees 
as good plantation trees- they aren't. really slow growing
High eucalyptus oil content highly flammable
Hint-bulldoze and replant native trees
7045 2018-08-11 23:01:49 In previous videos she’s mentioned that the ordinary’s rose hip oil helped her redness and scarring a ton!
7046 2018-08-11 23:01:46 Wait, 7 hours? That’s crazy. Amazing job though keeping your spirits so high , oil is quaking
7047 2018-08-11 23:01:44 Shoot  secure the area and supply mo okay? :( after all of this have your car fuels and oil checked. Pag pinasukan ng tubig mga yun slowly madadamage car mo :(
7048 2018-08-11 23:01:41 Chilling the coconut oil is necessary to form a stiff enough past for application. The low melting temperature of coconut makes it imperative that application of the charcoal mix be swift.
7049 2018-08-11 23:01:35 Forge has been waiting for her.

Not that it looks like it, there's still motor oil all over the exposed portion of his fingers and his exposed forehead under the headband on his head drenched in sweat.

Cue him swinging around in his chair.

"Wanda! Hey!" He said, jumping up, -
7050 2018-08-11 23:00:56 My ex and I were trading massages on night with some peppermint massage oil she bought. Things went in a different direction, and it was REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD!

7054 2018-08-11 23:00:41 Who selling thc oil?
7055 2018-08-11 23:00:37 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Tax this money 50% and build the wall!
@realdonaldtrump
7056 2018-08-11 23:00:36 ditto. Using Tom's profile too. Occasionally add a little canola oil for extra spice.

Oil? Butter?”
7059 2018-08-11 23:00:09 I’ve used bio oil and tbh it doesn’t actually do a lot, it’s really soft and light. My skin drinks a lot haha
7060 2018-08-11 23:00:04 Homemade tuyo pasta on olive oil 
7061 2018-08-11 22:59:54 What with chemtrails aerosols and GMO food, and food additives, etc, you should always have purifying activated charcoal detoxifying your system.  For those who may worry about the purity of the vasoline base, may use natural coconut oil ( Chilled)
7062 2018-08-11 22:59:30 could you imagine calling 911 and a medic rolling up on scene while you’re sobbing in pain and he says “here i have an essential oil for that”
7063 2018-08-11 22:59:28 Ready to try something new? Our Nurturing Rose Shampoo & Conditioner contains a moisturising blend of coconut & olive oil for healthy hair!
7064 2018-08-11 22:59:24 Why? After the garbage of NN was blown out of the water, what has happened since that would require government intervention?.....absolutely nothing, because NN was nothing more than a snake oil salesman trying to scare anyone about the internet...
7065 2018-08-11 22:59:21 He knows exactly what he is doing. He is a money changer. A con man. Selling snake oil to his #fakeChristian followers. All he is after is money! It's a #cult.
7066 2018-08-11 22:59:10 呼ぶと機材が壊れるってリプライしようと思ったけどあまりにも縁起悪過ぎるのでやめておきます。
7067 2018-08-11 22:59:06 Looks a bit like kabucha squash.  I would roast it without the seeds with a bit of olive oil and then taste it...some squash are incredibly sweet and great with pasta.  I add a little butter with goat cheese and voila!
7068 2018-08-11 22:58:44 help i use coconut oil to remove my makeup but i wash my face after
7069 2018-08-11 22:58:27 “Why is your music so loud?” 

“So that you think my car is shaking from the bass and not because I haven’t got an oil change in 7 years”

7078 2018-08-11 22:57:01 Take an old shoe. Soak it overnight in urine and spent motor oil. Season it with plenty of used bandaids and despair.

Bon appetit!
7079 2018-08-11 22:56:59 To clarify, when you say "allows us", do you mean that if we weren't reserve currency, and we printed money... then we'd what? Get hyperinflation? No one would use money?

Technically speaking no legal or physical law stops gov from printing more money. Dollars aren't oil backed.

7088 2018-08-11 22:56:19 非童貞非処女！
7089 2018-08-11 22:56:09 I love the sauce / don't give a fuck comedy etc, but this is significant. For over 70 years there's been some small sense that UK, US, Canada, EU etc would stump for basic decency. Sometimes. Where they could. If it didn't stop oil flowing. Maybe. Not any more. Liferaft diplomacy
7090 2018-08-11 22:56:04 Reminds me of a local towing co.  Last year ,had a waste oil tank leaking into the Grand River ..The cleanup cost was immense and the Co. was fined as they should be . Why is it any different for the industries polluting the St Laurence? Politics and $ ? Smh
7091 2018-08-11 22:55:49 Clearly Charlotte Flair got more than just her teeth fixed. Did you see the girls during her match on smack down and I'm not talking about the iconics or Becky Lynch. My God those things look like play doh with baby oil, bahahahahaha.

7100 2018-08-11 22:54:39 my coconut oil has been liquid for a few days now and that’s how i know i’ve been slowly baking in my room
7101 2018-08-11 22:54:27 @JusepTartaglia @jdefl61 @Jamespjudge1963 on the pipeline this is good oil bro!
7102 2018-08-11 22:54:18 I just read a yt comment of someone saying they only use coconut oil to remove makeup PLEASE deliver us from this evil
7103 2018-08-11 22:53:29 I can recommend using coconut oil once a week on your hair 
Stay away from harsh shampoos like head&shoulders and get something gentle like Johnson or a sulfate free one ( kind of pricy) 
For styling creams I recommend vatika for curly hair, or wella ( drugstore)
7104 2018-08-11 22:53:24 Watching Jamie's 30 minute meals in disgust. @jamieoliver you're a disgrace. Series 2 chicken skewers episode. The ammount of oil on that noodles dish is an abomination to the culinary world. You bang on about fresh produce yet you use noodles out of a packet. Drowned the thing!
7105 2018-08-11 22:53:20 my little sister just asked "if vegetable oil comes from vegetables then where does baby oil come from" and she really got me thinkin..
7106 2018-08-11 22:53:12 from an oil?
7107 2018-08-11 22:53:06 I was asked if we have Anointing Oil the answer is Yes we do. We have oil that is prayed over and come from Israel. We belive very strongly in Anointing. We hold Anointing's at every service it is part of our Ceremony. GGA
7108 2018-08-11 22:53:06 Apply oil religiously for the first 2 weeks and moisturize as often as possible. I’d say invest in real diamond (there are cheap options) instead of silver. My first 2 were silver and lost their shine, rusted, and caused infections. Not worth it!
7109 2018-08-11 22:53:03 Try CBD Oil. Used it recently and it's helped me sleep. Before that, I always woke up feeling very groggy with low energy.
7110 2018-08-11 22:52:05 I actually have no idea if it's bad for me or not lmaoo at least it's not oil
7111 2018-08-11 22:52:05 Dito kami sa may oil rig tol, kaparehas nung sa movie haha
7112 2018-08-11 22:52:04 With 40 years international banking experience, I can tell you that this is easier said than done.  Both gold and oil markets are globally settled in USD.  National currencies can be used but the Turks and Iranians will pay a hefty premium.  One day the Chinese currency (CNY) ...
7113 2018-08-11 22:51:52 The shapeshifting lizard people can time travel too, actually! Benghazi has nothing to do with a man named Ben Gahzi! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
7114 2018-08-11 22:51:48 Ohio isn't open yet. My pain doc doesn't think it'll help for me. He said he isn't impressed wi it for nerve damage & is worried it's not controlled enough. It's supposed to open here in Jan. I might try again after that to get a script. I hear the cpd oil works for nerve pain
7115 2018-08-11 22:51:46 He's still got it so cbd oil is the sh1t!
7116 2018-08-11 22:51:28 Cannot stand Avenatti. He's worse than a snake oil salesman. Guy is a real jerk.
7117 2018-08-11 22:51:25 Then if we go by your comment, that Alberta can keep all its oil money in province, and Quebec can have its rivers!
7118 2018-08-11 22:51:17 So where in this definition do tax cuts, economic growth, originalist federal judges, repealing the individual mandate, expanded oil drilling, pulling out of Paris/Iran deals, decimating ISIS, massively cutting regulations, gutting CFPB, historically low unemployment, fit in?
7119 2018-08-11 22:51:11 I think it was called PetroCAN... Canadian Oil for Canadians first, then sell rest at great prices to other countries...

What’s CO? Coconut oil 
7122 2018-08-11 22:50:24 Wahhabi will do what they do, nothing to stop that (Ottomans have tried for centuries), Saudis keep them in check as long as they have power and the oil flows
7123 2018-08-11 22:50:00 Ya causing traffic ooo
7124 2018-08-11 22:49:49 First the funding of political parties and politicians by big oil and big coal will have to be stopped.

7127 2018-08-11 22:49:19 Worse it's designed to keep things the way that they are. So Roger Pielke for example denies climate change not so much because he doesn't believe that it's happening but that there are personal advantages that accrue to him in the game oil companies play to keep burning it.

7131 2018-08-11 22:48:55 All I’ve had today is a cup of coffee with a tablespoon of coconut oil and I’m not hungry yet and I have all the energy in the world, what kind of magic potion did I just come upon.
7132 2018-08-11 22:48:54 Congrats on the oil money bootlicker
7133 2018-08-11 22:48:51 Got a new oil, and I smell magnificent
7134 2018-08-11 22:48:49 No problem with calling out shit hole countries with pathetic human rights records. The problem is that our government's virtue signalling was cherry picked and through Twitter. What about China or Russia or other countries that Canada imports Oil from like Algeria & Nigeria?
7135 2018-08-11 22:48:27 If you can’t handle someone not talking all day and not being home every night, don’t date an oil man.
7136 2018-08-11 22:48:18 Tidak boleh, meskipun SAE viscocity sama tapi aditive nya berbeda2 jika tercampur reaksi kimianya akan mempengaruhi viscocity oil and  oil film lubricationnya tidak sempurna melapisi permukaan part yg berputar akan berdampak ke life time part machine, change filter and flushing.

7139 2018-08-11 22:47:49 I think the...standard Dems....aren't receiving the funding they are used to. Too bad. They'll have to get on with less, be better candidates or get out of politics because I wouldnt vote for an oil money recipient.
7140 2018-08-11 22:47:48 You mean the self-infatuated snake oil salesman who conned his way into a presidency? That’s about to end! #VoteBlue2018

7145 2018-08-11 22:47:04 many of the world’s biggest polluters ... are not on track to meet the reductions targets they set for themselves.  ⁦@nytimes⁩ ⁦@JustinTrudeau⁩ ⁦@cathmckenna⁩ no more investments in oil and gas!

7149 2018-08-11 22:46:22 Conspiracy theory: car rental “free upgrades” are actually funded by Big Oil who then gouge you on filling up an oversized and inefficient vehicle
7150 2018-08-11 22:46:00 隙あらば
7151 2018-08-11 22:45:45 Well since the US exports substantially more oil to Mexico than vice versa, that doesn’t make a lot of sense. And prices are set, you don’t get to pick. Plus, Mexico exports more than 90% to other buyers. Good try.
7152 2018-08-11 22:45:45 Russia invade Crimea. US made oil prices chipper to punish Russia as before 1989. That hit Venezuela most. Now US is 'punishing' Turkey but if Turkey goes down, it can hit Europe too. Financial markets are very interdependent and fragile
7153 2018-08-11 22:45:36 I thought Mcguinty was just as bad as Wynne. I didn't vote against Wynne. I really voted against the liberals. They had an environment minister that was a bad day from becoming an eco terrorist.  I expected him to start ramming oil frigates with a raft.

7157 2018-08-11 22:45:03 It's one of the few things I use. If a thing is a fatty acids/natural oil suspension it'll be similar. I had tonnes of aphids, massively reduced them with it in one go & then ladybirds could keep the numbers low after that, without being poisoned.
7158 2018-08-11 22:44:55 We need to ditch Oil and Coal as they are relics of the past and are killing us. We need to invest in things like Solar, Hydro and making Cold Fusion work etc as they are the future.
7159 2018-08-11 22:44:35 What's something that's enriched with oil I need good brands

7162 2018-08-11 22:44:06 He is from oil & gas industry.  So you are right.  This is just a climate-change denier deal and anti-science.

7165 2018-08-11 22:43:56 Jagmeet Singh is ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. Canada must boycott Suadi oil to purchase it from other countries. I am not surprised that Donald Trump has kept mute over this Saudi issue with Canada. He must be happy.

7172 2018-08-11 22:42:31 All of that will be needed to sell the fish it will no longer be viable to export.
If we catch more it may end up  as fertiliser or we will go back to having margarine made from fish oil as we did in the past.

7175 2018-08-11 22:41:52 Are you an oil economist? Lots of oil you know this ok how much economical accessible oil is there? How would you manage and tax it? It’s easy to simply say these things but let’s hear from you on facts
7176 2018-08-11 22:41:52 She agg yeah I stopped over here after I got my oil changed

7183 2018-08-11 22:40:39 History is littered with scientific consensuses that didn't pan out. Remember peak oil? How about mass starvation due to overpopulation? Asking "do scientists agree" is just plain dumb. The question should be "what does the evidence show?". Guess what? It's doesn't show much.

7187 2018-08-11 22:40:00 Same lol.. I find all the shortcuts of an oil change
7188 2018-08-11 22:39:56 Lmao yeah people die from starvation in venzuela who also happens to own a huge part of the world's oil but somehow socialism is successful 
7189 2018-08-11 22:39:53 I’m just gonna design my own essential oil shelf bc Etsy is hella expensive for not having exactly what I want
7190 2018-08-11 22:39:47 Jam in black oil. I’m not sure if I can 
7191 2018-08-11 22:39:43 Oh yes. I thought virgin as in olive oil. You’re correct.
7192 2018-08-11 22:39:39 If u would have listened to Trump rather then cnn you would know how he plans on Mexico paying. They’ll never write a check...but there’s many ways to get it. My favorite one is give them $2.00 less per barrel of oil that we purchase. Mexico can’t say no, we don’t need their gas
7193 2018-08-11 22:39:33 Evil snake oil salesman!  Cannot stand to look at him or hear his voice!  Same with the person who ran against @realDonaldTrump
7194 2018-08-11 22:39:31 That singular tweet leaves a lot to be asked for. Also ending any tweet with "fuck off" is just disrespectful. There's some good discussion in that thread that helps clarify a bit what he was going for and the source of his agitation, but if I may add oil to the fire.. (1/2)
7195 2018-08-11 22:39:29 Watching Armageddon, my guilty pleasure. Do not bother me for the next two hours. That movie came out 20 years ago? Damn, I'm old. The movie is pro business, anti gubment and anti tax, super libertarian with an oil company exec saving the planet. Narrated by Chuck Heston.
7196 2018-08-11 22:39:18 Hmm. Brooks leaking oil. Should still birdie the 17th, but deficit for Tigre probably will be 3 or 4 tomorrow. Not terrible.
7197 2018-08-11 22:39:15 At the time of the crash, 70%~ of the economy was still held privately. I think other factors were more important.
"nationalised oil" is not unworkable. Other nations have it. Successfully.
7198 2018-08-11 22:39:10 TIL that Dean Acheson, asst state secretary under FDR, provoked the war with Japan. FDR limited oil sales to Japan for cash only, but when we went to meet Churchill in Newfoundland, Acheson froze Japan access to cash — and Yamamoto got OK for the Operation #AI, the Pearl Harbor.
7199 2018-08-11 22:38:58 Perhaps because Nixon was an actual crook and those you mention are not. But do feel free to spew your hate- it shows who you truly are and it’s certainly not a Christian but rather a snake oil salesman.
7200 2018-08-11 22:38:45 I’m waiting for people to sleep, so I can use palm oil to fry my plantain instead of using Vaseline. I like trying new things. 
7201 2018-08-11 22:38:22 Simple is the best. I love pasta and broccoli. All you need is olive oil, garlic, broccoli, pasta, parmesan cheese and a bit of crushed chili pepper. Yum! Takes 15 minutes to make
7202 2018-08-11 22:37:24 Cuddly? If arguing is what’s called for argue over who connects with Florida’s need for clean water, expansion of Medicare, oil free beaches,   modern rail transportation & Everglades Restoration, because Florida voters vote Florida issues over current presidential image.
7203 2018-08-11 22:37:22 Weed used to make me anxious but all I needed to do to fix that was freak out after large doses of weed oil so now when I smoke I feel normal in comparison
7204 2018-08-11 22:37:17 Jagmeet Singh is ABSOLUTELY RIGHT Canada must boycott Saudi oil purchase and buy it from other countries. This is a country with a horrible track record on human rights and doesn't want any country to talk about it. You add insult to injury, Donald Trump has kept mute over this.
7205 2018-08-11 22:36:24 Still at Islamabad International. PIA staff saying it may take another hour and a half. Couldn’t take a chance as there was an oil leak. What can I say . It’s better safe than sorry. Let’s see.
7206 2018-08-11 22:36:22 remember  temperature and type of oil are main variables #caramelize
7207 2018-08-11 22:36:10 Sure you guys have!!!! You guys also made 80% of foreign investment in the oil and gas industry leave the country in 3 years! Not to mention how the so called plan you guys had has cost more money to the middle class! Everything is way more expensive than when Harper was PM!
7208 2018-08-11 22:36:03 I think Connery followed by Daniel Craig
7209 2018-08-11 22:35:56 He's flexing his muscles picked on the wrong nation.  is  nation of principles and moral fortitude will not stand down in front of any shirtless bully  regard less how much oil is dropping fr him. Standing up for humanity is of far greater values
7210 2018-08-11 22:35:45 Snake oil. LNC That is spot on. That bloke has to use his own racist BS to “sell” his garbage comic because he can’t stand on merit. Talent is nothing, race is everything-The world according to Kwanzer.

7216 2018-08-11 22:35:19 And you don’t thing Chavez nationalizing oil, agriculture, finance and various other industries had very much to do with that?
7217 2018-08-11 22:35:10 Shouldn't you be out looking for citronella oil for your tiki torches?
7218 2018-08-11 22:34:58 Repaired and finished oil base
7219 2018-08-11 22:34:55 It's an option in the security settings. It's helpful when right wing infiltrators attempt to block environmental action against their sponsors. IE the oil and gas industry or republicans.
7220 2018-08-11 22:34:46 Long day. Bad oblique. Koepka is leaking oil too.
7221 2018-08-11 22:34:42 And an iScotland would own c95% of it.   

What an impressive percentage of such a valuable commodity. 

BUT how much did *Scotland’s* oil raise in revenues 2016-17 ?
7222 2018-08-11 22:34:22 Cosmo wants to hookup with 2 countries that depend on the Dollar, they get plenty dollars from oil and other mineral sales, my guess is if the 2 want to trade they'll want gold or silver, i can't imagine what they would want the Lira for
7223 2018-08-11 22:34:12 Do yourselves a favor and move to Venezuela and learn how socialized medicine and other social programs worked out for them. They have the largest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere and they can't even feed themselves due to their socialist policies!

7229 2018-08-11 22:33:23 And Nigeria is selling palm oil
7230 2018-08-11 22:33:11 Nobody in this world knows what will be with oil in 2021 especially HSBC))
7231 2018-08-11 22:33:01 The initials of the woman whose pic was, is frozen, is R J, spread eagled, so against JR Ewing, the tv Dallas oil tycoon, so if not also implies bush women who are against gasoline cars, is but really all shovings to bring matters to a head as such will obviously have to so.
7232 2018-08-11 22:32:42 Three places to me that are gross and overhyped in the food industry.
1. Papa John's- the pizza is so disgusting
2. Long John silver - just tastes like oil
3. Carl's Jr. - idk why but to me their food especially fries taste like the bottom of the bag overly frosted fries ewww.
7233 2018-08-11 22:32:39 In the entire UK?  Statistically this would indicate sighting a Burka would be relatively rare. Does the calculation of statistic presented include female Catholics, Jews, Protestants?
Selective presentation is suspected here.
7234 2018-08-11 22:32:37 Plenty oil in the sea tI'll 2050
7235 2018-08-11 22:32:35 Norway doesn't spend their oil revenue on social programs.

None of what you said about Saudi is true.
7236 2018-08-11 22:32:25 i’m starting to realize that the more i recognize the olives in olive oil the less i like it. they’ve snuck their way into normalcy, but they’re not going to stay there, at least when i’m around
7237 2018-08-11 22:32:12 No Oil!
7238 2018-08-11 22:32:03 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jess
7239 2018-08-11 22:31:51 early dinner -  easy peasy veggie pizza,  caramelized sweet onions & garlic, sautéed peppers, sautéed tomatoes, kalamata olives, fresh basil olive oil, balsamic vinegar, vegan mozzarella & parmesan,   cauliflower pizza crust.  in oven now.
7240 2018-08-11 22:31:48 It's raining and someone let me put on Grouper at work.
7241 2018-08-11 22:31:34 Except the people don't own their own oil there either. Their government/royal family does. We had the opportunity to nationalize and have pipelines coast to coast with PET but Prem Lougheed wanted to sell to rich Americans and he got his wish.
7242 2018-08-11 22:31:33 all that icing was like an oil treatment for my hair or something because my hair is soft af today 
7243 2018-08-11 22:31:31 North Sea oil revenue has all but vanished — but there has been no national hammerblow as a result. Instead, more Scots are in work than ever before. Scottish pensioner poverty is lower than ever before. Scottish household wealth is higher than ever before.
7244 2018-08-11 22:31:11 @united flight 5863.  Why did you book me on a plane that you need to do an oil change?   I wouldn’t of purchased the tickets ....... wait I get it!!!   You suck !!
7245 2018-08-11 22:31:05 I don’t think we should get *too* optimistic here. The Flint was without water for two years under Obama, and he didn’t step in the for oil pipeline mess. Clinton probably wouldn’t be much different than Obama.
7246 2018-08-11 22:30:51 Sask oil too;)
7247 2018-08-11 22:30:43 Not entirely electric, but yes, I believe the oil is for export, taking steam out of the “think about that the next time you fuel up” argument.
7248 2018-08-11 22:30:29 Last performance at Lucas Oil with SCVC was a lil off the wall 
7249 2018-08-11 22:30:11 一昨日は日差しに苦しんだけど気配すらない
7250 2018-08-11 22:29:52 Went for a oil change and they found all other problems. 
7251 2018-08-11 22:29:47 My Uber smells like used cooking oil 
7252 2018-08-11 22:29:41 Just saw a Tesla with licence plate: EF OIL. Nice.
7253 2018-08-11 22:28:59 Palm oil
7254 2018-08-11 22:28:46 Couldn't agree more. Saudi oil coursing through the veins of so many global economies has rendered those shameless countries mute.
7255 2018-08-11 22:28:44 Our dollar is used for trading oil. Our alliance is a strange one but hopefully it will continue to bring reforms for the people there.

I'm definitely not in agreement how they treat women over there.

We're also helping them with a war in Yemen right now.
7256 2018-08-11 22:28:35 The oil fields are calling my name 
7257 2018-08-11 22:28:33 @6ix9ine i want to pain a 22meters high portrait oil painting of you. Send me high resolution photo
7258 2018-08-11 22:28:31 Man I’m bout to slap the oil off one of these niggahs faces if they don’t hurry tf up
7259 2018-08-11 22:28:30 Making my own CBD oil. Have high grade Harlequin female seeds. A vaporizer sounds like the way to go though. The harlequin plant has a higher concentration of CBD than others do.
7260 2018-08-11 22:28:09 Shrimp, some butter, olive oil, ginger, Asian seasoning, broccoli tossed in a fettuccine (made from corn) for dinner 
7261 2018-08-11 22:28:09 He said, "oil can"!  #MeTVWWWest
7262 2018-08-11 22:28:08 コナハンで罰ゲーム誰か描いてくれよな～
7263 2018-08-11 22:28:04 My new toy - a very simple air fryer. I just put a little bit of salt on the courgette, 180 degrees for 10 minutes. It is sweet with a drizzle of sesame oil and maggi sauce!
7264 2018-08-11 22:27:51 I was born in 1980 but Reagan always reminded of a smarmy snake oil salesman.
7265 2018-08-11 22:27:46 *further

This is what I get for posting while cooking. I've got olive oil all over my keyboard.
7266 2018-08-11 22:27:30 they fry everything in peanut oil so I can’t have any of it
7267 2018-08-11 22:27:29 That's nothing new. There were oil tankers here last winter.
7268 2018-08-11 22:27:05 Koepka leaking oil
7269 2018-08-11 22:26:59 おはご！
7270 2018-08-11 22:26:59 Oil is a bonus scotland has plenty of rich resources
7271 2018-08-11 22:26:46 Americans condemned Nazis when we destroyed them in WWII. My grandfather bombed their oil reserves. Why do I need to prove anything? Screw you hippies
7272 2018-08-11 22:26:42 Need to cop more coconut oil for my beard
7273 2018-08-11 22:26:41 I hope people didn't think trans/enby people, Vegeta Oil.
7274 2018-08-11 22:26:13 おはよう！！
7275 2018-08-11 22:26:11 Someone that works there said they fry their bacon and fries in the same oil.
7276 2018-08-11 22:26:08 If we are being real, yes, both are very disgusting...there is a reason I don’t drink them too often. The reason being they can clean oil stains off of driveways. I try to not think about it when I indulge lol
7277 2018-08-11 22:25:41 Oh God I remember the Mustang II from when I was a kid.  What a disappointment for '74.  I like to see them now because they are fairly rare but boy did the Arab oil embargo put a crimp in the American muscle car
7278 2018-08-11 22:25:39 Yeah, whale oil was only abandoned after we'd sailed to the ends of the earth to kill nearly every last one of them. And at the same time petroleum was so plentiful it was literally just bubbling out of the ground.
7279 2018-08-11 22:25:34 Only pockets deep enough to finance all this global terrorism and subversion is the oil cartel, you rid the Earth of that, you may have a chance.
7280 2018-08-11 22:25:28 Coconut oil 
7281 2018-08-11 22:25:22 In 1957 i was a pipefitter building a cracker plant in Clarkson Ont. To refine canadian oil Why was it mothballed?
7282 2018-08-11 22:25:18 My favorite part of summer is watching the coconut oil next to my bed go from solid to liquid back to solid again everyday
7283 2018-08-11 22:25:16 make oil pipe go to ocean
7284 2018-08-11 22:25:02 I'm a fan. Nice mobility, can make a good first pass, generally in the right spot. Will be watching him closely at Oil Kings games this season.

(Not an offensive D per se, but scored a really nice goal earlier in the week.)
7285 2018-08-11 22:24:52 People who complain about healthcare costs need to realize there are essential oil diffusers available for as little as $10.
7286 2018-08-11 22:24:50 Got an oil change
7287 2018-08-11 22:24:33 Mix with egg yoke and little honey for conditioning, then wash off
When dry, apply as normal hair oil
7288 2018-08-11 22:24:28 I really want to soak in a oil bath 
7289 2018-08-11 22:24:26 My fried eggs practically swim in the oil. They have to be able to float just a bit as the pan isn't what's cooking them, it's the oil.

Then again I might be doing something unique to others... XD
7290 2018-08-11 22:24:26 veterans. Brother made his own CBD oil. Works great and didn't cost anything. He found high grade harlequin seeds from some company. So I think I'll just use those seeds since they produce more CBD than other kinds.
7291 2018-08-11 22:24:19 Do big discounts no pipeline
N&L oil fine for me.
7292 2018-08-11 22:23:51 Good luck tonight Champ! @IamMayorKun Oil full your head brada 
7293 2018-08-11 22:23:38 Perdi mi oil wow

7295 2018-08-11 22:23:04 If u drink coconut oil, one spoonful morning n another at night few days to ur period, u won’t experience any cramps. I tried this n I was shocked , d freest flow ever. Life isn’t as hard as we thought.
7296 2018-08-11 22:23:04 起きました
7297 2018-08-11 22:23:02 So question "why the Nigerian federation" comes to mind

This is another reason for #ReferendumNow

Our States are not viable Federating Units becos they are arbitrary creations of the military, for disbursement of centrally collected oil revenues & not self-responsibility...5/5
7298 2018-08-11 22:22:57 やばい眠い
7299 2018-08-11 22:22:53 North Sea oil sector was still in fairly good health. In the SNP’s economic manifesto for independence, it gave estimates of up to £7.9 billion a year for oil revenues. Then the oil price crashed — and oil revenues are now 99 per cent lower, at £60 million. This is no freak:
7300 2018-08-11 22:22:44 Idk of people are just really dumb or straight lying? "My car needs synthetic!" Little do they know, the oil change facility uses a synthetic blend that is mostly conventional.
7301 2018-08-11 22:22:37 Or late at night? I believe he burns the MN oil as well?
7302 2018-08-11 22:22:36 @HulkHogan we are @BeardSconsin and we want to send you some of thee best beard oil & balm made. We ant you to take care of that hall of game stache game. Hit us back and we will set something up! #Hulkamania #goat #bestevertodoit
7303 2018-08-11 22:22:20 お疲れ様でしたー！
楽しかったです！（＾ω＾）
7304 2018-08-11 22:22:10 Everyone’s out getting drunk and Fingered and I’m sitting here with coconut oil in my hair, a cup of tea and reading a book on Diary of a side chick. . 
7305 2018-08-11 22:22:07 And Saudi Arabia, too.  I wish tech would unshackle the free world from the Saudis for good.  Unlike Turkey or Russia, we are subsidizing them with oil purchases every day, condoning their war in Yemen, their wahhabi atrocities, public beheadings, etc.
7306 2018-08-11 22:22:04 thanks b! n i use olive oil to keep them healthy/strong, n when i wear mascara i just curl them and use lash sensational by maybelline
7307 2018-08-11 22:21:59 Maple flavor honey oil.
7308 2018-08-11 22:21:45 I’ve played for coaches like him and I can tell you he deserves to be let go. Its insane that coaches think that cussing someone out makes them want to try harder... actually, it’s the OPPOSITE. Obviously it’s not working either considering their 10-15 under him!
7309 2018-08-11 22:21:31 Plz do vote Dem for those reasons (& many more). Hwvr, climate crisis is more urgent than most Americans know. Big Oil $ infusions to Dem party risk policy influence. Dem party def'ly "better", now, but if this is compromised, shame on us. I believe in expressing expectations.
7310 2018-08-11 22:21:29  Relax her- in order to give her a full orgasm you must relax her mind and body. Oil massages, head rubs , booty rubs ect. Will help 
Take your time-there's no rush 
 Hype her up-make feel like she's "fuckin it up ". She'll feel more confident about herself and will do more
7311 2018-08-11 22:21:24 Why isn't there an oil painting of John Gibbons hanging above every fireplace in Canada?

#BlueJays
7312 2018-08-11 22:21:16 If you ever read the Shetland times/News you'll soon come to realize that the daily letter writers/posters have been bombarding the locals for decades with their Unionist claptrap, the tiny oil fund they were given back in the 70's has created their undying loyalty forever more.
7313 2018-08-11 22:21:03 I personally don’t give a rats ass about are relationship with Saudi Arabia (specifically the bullshit monarchy). If we don’t move swiftly to distance ourselves from all that oil that is dooming our children then we don’t deserve to survive as a species.
7314 2018-08-11 22:21:03 What is in the oil
7315 2018-08-11 22:20:35 dunno. Made her leave the line.
7316 2018-08-11 22:20:31 We might have oil but yet to receive any money as it goes directly to westminster
7317 2018-08-11 22:20:28 Yep, I RT'd that one, a very good response.

I also wanted to express my disgust that his followers still think he's "fighting the good fight."

There are reasonable arguments in favor of conservative ideas. They are being drowned out by snake oil salesmen like Jones.
7318 2018-08-11 22:20:28 I saw someone in the thread of that tweet say they pay like $200 for an oil change I was like uhhh
7319 2018-08-11 22:20:26 I wish i had someone to massgae this oil on my back  #thejoysofbeingsinglesingle
7320 2018-08-11 22:20:08 Prayer whey don sink enter my eleda alwedi. Dnt worry i will bring palm oil, pomo kika and ekuru for you.
7321 2018-08-11 22:20:00 What did you mix yours with? I’ll just mix mine with my coconut oil and alikay hair growth oil then maybe jojoba oil. Jojoba oil works wonders too though.
7322 2018-08-11 22:19:44 With half pot of soup- onion, oil, salt
7323 2018-08-11 22:19:37 Been using my bro beard oil for few weeks and now he’s going.... which mean I have to go buy my own smh
7324 2018-08-11 22:19:27 Blah. Too much oil and vinegar.
7325 2018-08-11 22:19:24 Do u think the indigenous people have the opportunity To work in any oil company in Canada ? Do u think Aramco company is small? Over 50k employees 85% are Saudis
7326 2018-08-11 22:19:22 Tonight’s special starter: Burrata from @distefanocheese with TX figs, #animalfarms arugula, prosciutto, extra virgin olive oil, and Maldon salt. 
7327 2018-08-11 22:19:17 I ate some coconut oil but I’m thirsty. But oil and water don’t mix so I don’t want to kill myself.
7328 2018-08-11 22:19:10 "Bikers for Trump" are also affliliated with: 
"Seals for Oil Spills" and
"Elephants for Donald Trump Junior"

7331 2018-08-11 22:19:02 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
7332 2018-08-11 22:19:02 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
7333 2018-08-11 22:19:01 Norway expects 21 billion in revenues from oil for 2018 under UK system oiltax revenue of .9 billion for 2018 ? Gers you havin a laff ?
7334 2018-08-11 22:18:59 Ohhhh, now that's different.  Yes, if we could seel Alberta and NEBC oil withing our own country. ...
Yes.
7335 2018-08-11 22:18:52 Think you got that wrong scotland does not see any oil money as it goes straight to westminster
7336 2018-08-11 22:18:38 No where else matters these days, unless you have oil...
7337 2018-08-11 22:18:34 Their red-helmed warrior on his way to the promised land painted in whale oil (from a lamp) rubbed against their precious lambpits
7338 2018-08-11 22:18:22 @JiffyLubeON If any customers haven't put Semi Synthetic in their vehicle, my life is very busy so I never know when my oil change will happen but 21000kms in an 07' Caravan with Semi Synthetic! Yeah It helped! Try for yourself, #lifegetsbusy
7339 2018-08-11 22:18:19 Oil!.. dats your way
7340 2018-08-11 22:18:17 My dumbass friend said she once paid $160 for an oil change on her Toyota Camry...her dad almost suplexed her ass on the hood when he found out she was gooped at the vavoline store. I was craving uppp lmao
7341 2018-08-11 22:18:14 I put truffle oil on tater tots and life may never be the same.
7342 2018-08-11 22:17:51 When we leave the EU does it mean we can call Oil of Olay by it's proper name, Oil of Ulay again? #Brexit #EU #OilofOlay
7343 2018-08-11 22:17:26 Hopefully the MDT will stop the amputation before a mildly crook limb is amputated on the advice of a load of snake oil salesman stuck in a different century
7344 2018-08-11 22:17:16 We don't have a leaky tar sands pipeline in Canada. 
Heck, we do t even have a leaky oil sands pipeline in Canada.
7345 2018-08-11 22:17:06 If I break your heart na oil spillage
7346 2018-08-11 22:17:03 lol i need to try! i got ahold of the oil & that was cool but i love gummies!
7347 2018-08-11 22:16:52 Enough of your flea market snake oil!
7348 2018-08-11 22:16:49 Horse shit! We  can weigh in on human rights abuses whenever or wherever we se fit! Thugs don’t get a pass because they sit on a giant pond of oil. The sooner we all get past the oil era the better.
7349 2018-08-11 22:16:40 They sell oil to Canada, organize their society so the cost of labour pocket-lint and kill protestors .    That's how they roll.
7350 2018-08-11 22:16:30 Carlos:(..) We have much more water sources than anywhere in the world. We have qualified lands. And I hope everything will be good for Venezuela.

(in another interview)Carlos:Venezuela has large oil reserves. We have coltan lithium, uranium, copper reserves. We have everything.
7351 2018-08-11 22:16:26 si sube el gasoleo de los autobuses, suben las tarifas de transportes. Si sube el de los camiones, suben las mercancias y si sube el fuel oil d elas centrales termicas. sube la fra d ela luz...(todo es una cadena, nadie se salva, aunque viaje en bicicleta)

Does your toner strip oil(s) off the skin, or hydrate your skin? 
#summerskintips
7354 2018-08-11 22:16:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
7355 2018-08-11 22:16:03 Ok. I’m a little slow today. Not following. It sounded like you were saying pasta with olive oil ONLY was better than pasta with tomato sauce (gravy damnit!)
7356 2018-08-11 22:15:56 What about Ghana oil? 
7357 2018-08-11 22:15:52 we get oil changes though 
7358 2018-08-11 22:15:52 Eerm, no. 
We already are selling our Canadian oil and a discount to the US, the only country we do sell oil to.
Any oil we can get to tidewater sjould be sold on the world market. :)
7359 2018-08-11 22:15:51 Dan they can take it 800 if they want for a month. Then fly kind of.what they did wil oil in the 20s
7360 2018-08-11 22:15:46 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
7361 2018-08-11 22:15:36 They can’t say anything because the Saudis have oil, spend billions buying arms from the US and Europe, have vast influence in the Middle East and strategically are required as an ally in the geopolitical fight against Iran and Russia. Zim doesn’t have such leverage.
7362 2018-08-11 22:15:27 I get it.  Trust me, I love the stuff.  When I saw the soybean oil in it, it crushed me.  I now just make my own but it's a pain to do on a weekly basis.
7363 2018-08-11 22:15:26 That mustache oil is seeping into his brain.
7364 2018-08-11 22:15:26 3 eggs, 220ml milk, about 300g of flour (you can do more or less that depends on you), a cup of sugar (or like around 100-150g), 70 of butter (or like 3 spoons of oil), and baking powder 
7365 2018-08-11 22:15:05 Yes
It's really good 
Lol...p.s coconut oil is bae
7366 2018-08-11 22:14:58 changing your own oil sucks, it's worth it to take it somewhere else because you probably only end up saving like $2
7367 2018-08-11 22:14:41 Highly recommend! I added a glug of olive oil, a sprinkle of balsamic, some garlic, and spice mix
7368 2018-08-11 22:14:26 Trickle down (horse and sparrow theory) was an idea put forth by Friedman. In any right I think it was an idiotic one at best, but was intended to combat Volckers deflationary contraction and get the economy moving after loss of the gold standard in '71 and oil embargo.
7369 2018-08-11 22:14:11 Lmao rarely straightening it, Jamaican castor oil
7370 2018-08-11 22:14:04 Coconut oil is your best friend. Used it exclusively for my second tattoo and it was perfect

7372 2018-08-11 22:13:35 Take it as needed and you'll be fine. Black seed oil helped with my cramps a lot. Just gotta take it consistently.
7373 2018-08-11 22:13:24 Bring out the Nintendo switch and suddenly your the most popular dude at the oil change lobby.
7374 2018-08-11 22:13:20 How about cutting down on unnecessary expenses by bringing back soldiers who are protesting oil and poppy fields in foreign countries?
7375 2018-08-11 22:13:10 No such thing as liver cleanses (your liver can look after itself) but as a fellow party person here is this recipe: get some potatoes  and a fish fillet and throw them in a pot with water, some olive oil, herbs, salt, and whatever spices you feel like. This will help you both.
7376 2018-08-11 22:13:05 おはようございます。幸せな気持ちになれましたありがとうございます！
7377 2018-08-11 22:13:01 Probably found some space oil that needs liberating
7378 2018-08-11 22:12:58 Except the MAJOR factors that resulted in this are not socialist.
If morons weren't making so much hay over it, I might concede, but fact is that economic sanctions, reliance on oil when it slumped & corruption are, imo, the three biggest factors. None of which are "partisan"
7379 2018-08-11 22:12:55 They are doing documentaries about City last season? I hope there's a massive asterix in there about oil money
7380 2018-08-11 22:12:45 It is the most versatile sandwich there is. I’ve microwaved white bread with American cheese and dipped it in ketchup, or used artisan sourdough with Munster, olive oil and garlic spices with a side of salsa.
7381 2018-08-11 22:12:42 You need some oil on that axe 
7382 2018-08-11 22:12:41 Apparently I have golden hairs near my hairline. And all my family like omg you got golden hair what you done. Nothing mate it’s natural only coconut oil/sun
7383 2018-08-11 22:12:36 Hi Mark, stumbled on to your video some time ago and can say you are a blessing brother. Your prophecy on energy and the National debt being wiped out, do you think beside OIL, could these be also be accomplished by purging the corruption from the government (patient office) and
7384 2018-08-11 22:12:23 Yeah how dare Singh suggest refining oil in Canada instead of ripping and shipping it for pennies

It is far more logical to to suggest an export pipeline would displace foreign imports.

Facepalm.
7385 2018-08-11 22:12:11 Nothing like buying new pants and then IMMEDIATELY spilling oil on them
7386 2018-08-11 22:11:57 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
7387 2018-08-11 22:11:51 @united Flight 5863 from Eugene to Denver delayed because of an oil change.... really United, You didn’t see that coming.   You don’t care about us and are families!  #UnitedAirlines
7388 2018-08-11 22:11:29 % of women total or just Muslims?
As far as making a claim statistically it makes a difference.
7389 2018-08-11 22:11:26 Need more oil then.
7390 2018-08-11 22:11:11 Countries would probably want to buy oil at the lowest possible price, which is most likely the Louisiana Port that already exists. Green energy please, that’s what I want. Canada should lead, not trail clumsily behind.
7391 2018-08-11 22:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: day-old crust with chunky motor oil and pulled pork.
7392 2018-08-11 22:10:25 i just realized my car needs an oil change lmaooooo I don’t wanna be grown
7393 2018-08-11 22:10:22 見回り行ってきまーす！
7394 2018-08-11 22:10:08 where can I get some of this 'snack oil'. it sounds like something prez trumpy two scoops would like. i want to send him some.
7395 2018-08-11 22:10:05 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
7396 2018-08-11 22:09:42 Ay shawdy lemme eat that derrick like an oil-dependent military superpower.
7397 2018-08-11 22:09:32 Los millenials descubren el “snake oil”
7398 2018-08-11 22:09:29 Yo my @chevrolet cruze 2LT has a clicking noise when idling. Is that an oil issue or something else?
7399 2018-08-11 22:09:28 As soon as I've served you, you've never poured oil on the ground again, and walked and married again.
7400 2018-08-11 22:09:12 I’ve never undestood them myself. Olive oil. Yes! Olives. No!
7401 2018-08-11 22:08:32 It will. I hope Arsenal can beat the oil merchants. Sick of them
7402 2018-08-11 22:08:31 Yesterday I walked round the art store taking in all the mysical elixir of the vanishes, the almost unattainable beauty of the oil paints and the brushes and had to console myself with some pencils haha
7403 2018-08-11 22:08:30 it wasn't that bad as it goes. Rear brakes and an oil change.
7404 2018-08-11 22:08:08 It's not rocket science, 1c oil, 1/3 cup vinegar, dollop of sweet mustard, season...I add a little sweetener. Delish.
7405 2018-08-11 22:07:44 Ain't this just a Juicero? WAIT JUICERO SUED THEM? All that plastic.
7406 2018-08-11 22:07:23 A little bit not extensively. I use them pretty sparingly as I worry about them negatively impacting my cats. I like lavender oil but have to be pretty careful as it’s toxic for cats.
7407 2018-08-11 22:07:10 Jordan is a good man!! Ryan is the establishment!likes oil money!!
7408 2018-08-11 22:07:01 Let her have her moment! Learn to let people enjoy things!
7409 2018-08-11 22:06:45 Genuine qn - to what extent is this a non Asian emerging mkt problem? I believe China has been preparing for this and social stability,  ie economic growth,  is paramount so imho there is no floor to CNY and rice / pork /oil imports are all that r short term important
7410 2018-08-11 22:06:21 ES QUE ME CUELGO DE AVISARTE PERDON. ES LO MAS TUERNO QUE HAY OIL DE MODO TIO Y BEUNO TAMBIEN Y APARTE QUE QUIERAN TENER HIJOS YO MUERTA
7411 2018-08-11 22:06:19 Craving sardines in olive oil but the King Oscar brand only
7412 2018-08-11 22:06:12 Duke's?  Soybean oil...?
7413 2018-08-11 22:05:58 I was changing a trucks oil, and the boss came is and said “When you finish this one, close the shop up, it’s been a long fucking week” so I got to go home early. 
7414 2018-08-11 22:05:48 But instead rubbed the oil on her iskaba
7415 2018-08-11 22:05:23 Or petroleum becoming as obsolete and worthless as whale oil
7416 2018-08-11 22:04:49 dishsoap brownies:

2eggs (let some of the shell pieces fall in to the batter)
the Mix (storebought brownie sauce)
h2o
veggie oil 

mix it up in bowl, eat half of the batter, stop to wash dishes&spill some dishsoap into them for a little extra kick. lament, but bake anyway. enjoy
7417 2018-08-11 22:04:19 ima try oil painting before the end of this year.
7418 2018-08-11 22:04:11 As the Steele dossier says, the Trump team was offered the brokerage fee on the privatization of 19% of the Russian oil giant Rosneft. Page was in Moscow when the sale was announced on December 7.
7419 2018-08-11 22:03:59 Oil again
7420 2018-08-11 22:03:55 Boil nettles .... and I'd like to add using waste oil on a holly bush
7421 2018-08-11 22:03:38 빨강머리 백설공주 재밋다
7422 2018-08-11 22:03:22 you probably get thia a lot but damn your eyes are gorgeous 
7423 2018-08-11 22:03:19 You're missing the point aren't you? And they can't be "circulating for over 4 years" because card reader was used for the first time in 2015.

The whole point of those pictures is to acknowledge underaged voting which was very rampant in the north. I was hoping we would deny it.
7424 2018-08-11 22:03:12 Says a self-infatuated, attention seeking, snake- oil salesman...who loves hyphenated words, and is a corrupt liar.
7425 2018-08-11 22:02:48 das Öl / oil
7426 2018-08-11 22:02:42 European leaders sell their soul and humanity to murderous regime of #iran. They are silent when they see the regime kills protesters in #IranProtests however they buy Iran's oil. Such a shame. #IranBloodOil4EU
#IranRegimeChange
#CaspianSeaSellOut
7427 2018-08-11 22:02:35 Well done, sir.
7428 2018-08-11 22:02:11 I used oil paints for the semi-first time ever and I painted guy's lips and Jin's too and I'm actually REALLY proud
7429 2018-08-11 22:02:07 Success means not starting wars for oil. Success means having control over all our tax levers. Success means retaining all our income. Success means voting for people and achieving that outcome. 

Success means having neighbours not masters. 

Who said it couldn’t be successful?
7430 2018-08-11 22:01:58 Heat up some oil on the stove lmao
7431 2018-08-11 22:01:55 Mostly Baton Rouge to Greenville, Mount Vernon every once in a while and Red and Ouachita rivers. We’re on a Placid Oil contract right now
7432 2018-08-11 22:01:34 He’s just another snake oil salesmen hiding behind “the Lord”

God not existing is Jerry Fawell’s best case scenario. No omnipresent, benevolent entity would put up with this s***
7433 2018-08-11 22:01:25 No no no. 

Cut the okra, and cube the green tomato. Coat all in flour, salt/season, and fry in a cast iron skillet with oil or Crisco. Heaven on earth.
7434 2018-08-11 22:01:25 Yep, and sometimes it works. The one we have is a snake oil salesman if ever there was one.
7435 2018-08-11 22:01:03 Btw, the money we make from the oil is stored in our oil fund owned by the state that will be saved for future generations.

So if its not invested in anything, an inflation could make the cash useless. Yay.
7436 2018-08-11 22:01:03 Venezuela has oil but look at them to today.

Their currency is more like a tissue paper.
7437 2018-08-11 22:00:59 I will not vote for ANYONE who takes money or supports big oil, big pharma, or big anything else.
7438 2018-08-11 22:00:53 Oil blotting pads are life savers
7439 2018-08-11 22:00:49 oil
7440 2018-08-11 22:00:47 Tea tree oil smells fucking nasty
7441 2018-08-11 22:00:34 I’m pooping and juuling inside Lucas Oil Stadium right now
7442 2018-08-11 22:00:34 메이코 : 석유가 도착하는데 걸리는 시간은?
카이토 : 나라마다 다르겠지? :D
메이코 : 바카이토... 오일이라구 (Oil)
7443 2018-08-11 22:00:27 Hot take: truffle oil is overrated and every thing I've ever eaten that had it would have been better off without
7444 2018-08-11 22:00:23 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
7445 2018-08-11 22:00:15 I’m legit so excited because I bought a cute ass calendar and oil diffuser. 
7446 2018-08-11 21:59:34 How is it that I got my oil and filter changed regularly but yet...my filter NEVER got changed? LOL. Thanks cookeville. 
7447 2018-08-11 21:59:32 Apparently even in the 70s they said the oil only had a few years and it would run out. They are still saying the same thing
7448 2018-08-11 21:59:19 It was radish, cucumber, arugula, tomato and soft boiled egg on a baguette with like just a little salt, pepper and olive oil.
7449 2018-08-11 21:59:17 This is exactly the treatment I was going to suggest Lie on one side and put in some warm olive oil for a couple of minutes Pop in some cotton wool and turn over onto the hot water bottle This is a pre NHS method when olive oil was only available at chemists
7450 2018-08-11 21:59:16 Steel mills, oil refineries for example are pollutant creating manufacturing plants, while microchip assemblies are also manufacturing plants but produce little to no pollutants. All would be in the study, and units produced calculated the same.
7451 2018-08-11 21:58:57 For not red flagging Moto2 when there was oil on the track
7452 2018-08-11 21:58:56 Tfw you’re getting your oil changed and they tell you to turn on your blinker but instead you turn on the windshield wipers
7453 2018-08-11 21:58:53 This article is wrong: the new resolution didn't reverse the old one. The new one deals with contributions to campaigns, not to the DNC (which still prohibits oil PAC $). It might go against the spirit of the ban on $ to the DNC, but it doesn't reverse it.
7454 2018-08-11 21:58:52 These pictures have been circulating the internet for more than four years now... Tell me something else
7455 2018-08-11 21:58:38 i made her use coconut oil once ;)
7456 2018-08-11 21:57:51 Oil
I'm up for it
7457 2018-08-11 21:57:49 Canola Oil came and went..
7458 2018-08-11 21:57:48 Not that this Saudi paid troll is worth arguing with but he has one very valid point. The Saudi's own their oil. We don't. We give ours away for pennies to corporations (often foreign corporations) and the wealth goes right into private hands instead of the public good.
7459 2018-08-11 21:57:42 @ezralevant How long before the premier of Alberta starts referring to their oil as 'ethical' ?
7460 2018-08-11 21:57:20 that massive waste of resources that goes into #fracking is astounding.... look at the size of those valves!

the pressure they must have to withstand

how many barrels of oil does it take in investment to extract 1 barrel of oil?
7461 2018-08-11 21:57:10 you mean like the a holes in texas who pour oil in your gas tank or catch your car on fire if you had a HIllary sign in your yard?????
7462 2018-08-11 21:57:08 I gotta buy tanning oil cus I wanna come back like a butter pecan
7463 2018-08-11 21:56:41 Shhhhhh.... just screw an oil filter to the end of it and dont get caught... Or keep the kitty inside and don't worry about it to begin with haha
7464 2018-08-11 21:56:29 Before I loved doing makeup and knew nothing I would bake my face as a skin care step.. I thought it was for getting rid of oil
7465 2018-08-11 21:56:18 Taste like salted oil
7466 2018-08-11 21:55:59 currently getting my oil changed and on the tv there was a commercial and the dad told his kid “save money and change your own oil” 
7467 2018-08-11 21:55:56 Nothing beats that sweet, fruity pleasure and argan oil to nourish the skin!  Reunited and it feels so good!
7468 2018-08-11 21:55:53 My prayer's & blessings are with your wife through this battle
Cannabis oil will help her through the sickness is the side effects of chemo
7469 2018-08-11 21:55:24 i took cbd oil  waiting for THAT to kick in. i got stuff to do
7470 2018-08-11 21:55:22 I usually try lavender oil to calm me bc I get worked up when In pain. Hopefully you feel better. Possible migraine maybe?
7471 2018-08-11 21:55:12 only salt source is healthy Braggs Aminos -- olive oil based dressing  -- what's the problem??
7472 2018-08-11 21:54:58 And we haven't come to policies that keep cost of oil lower than most other countries, and otherwise fail to externalize the environmental impacts of industrial commodity monoculture
7473 2018-08-11 21:54:57 Midnight Oil, INXS, to może AC/DC? Aussie dzisiaj?
7474 2018-08-11 21:54:56 اتفق
7475 2018-08-11 21:54:56 Thanks to Republicans it will be paper mill and oil drilling country
7476 2018-08-11 21:54:45 She is snake oil saleswoman. What do you expect from a low life like herself?
7477 2018-08-11 21:54:42 Do you need high quality marijuana, cannabis oil, shatter, wax, carts and many more? Just what's app me for more information and we do deliveries in UK and Europe as a whole What's app.....+447951281674 if in Europe and Text or call+15594927195 if in USA.

7479 2018-08-11 21:54:29 Me: what time is it? 
Noah: garlic oil, vegan cheese, almond ricotta, caramelized onions, broccolini.
7480 2018-08-11 21:54:15 1. There is a market in Canada. Why do we import ? 

2. I‘d be ok with pipelines for actual oil in Canada 

3 safest At to transport bitumen is actually by large pick via rail 

thanks tho
7481 2018-08-11 21:54:08 So my roomies got a dude sleeping on our couch right now (don’t get me started) but I wa sin the bathroom looking for face lotion and found a serum! Put it all over my face and THEN looked at the label....it’s a beard growth oil hahaha fuuckk
7482 2018-08-11 21:54:03 Question, who would we fight? Also, where is their any oil up there?
7483 2018-08-11 21:54:00 Nothing to wonder. There's oil in the Niger Delta.
7484 2018-08-11 21:53:22 Going back for more castor oil and leave ins so I’m covered till 2020 
7485 2018-08-11 21:53:18 There's a spray called Bug Clear for Fruit & Veg & I'm 99% sure it's classed as organic (as with some poisons but you know that). This one chokes them with film of oil. They love dry conditions so it's been perfect for them 
7486 2018-08-11 21:53:07 yah I think it was blood now people have said it to me, it just looked really dark to me when I saw it so I assumed oil idk
7487 2018-08-11 21:53:03 Use almond rather than olive oil, it's less acidic. You should be able to find an ear washing kit (best sort are those with a rubber bulb), after a couple of days with the oil get a couple of soluble asprins dissolved in warm water and douche out your ear
7488 2018-08-11 21:53:02 Use coconut oil instead, this Jamaican castor oil is like weed 
7489 2018-08-11 21:52:46 this is so sad
7490 2018-08-11 21:52:42 did akpabio transformed the state with is personal money or is the oil in AKS been drilled in ik sen.district?
7491 2018-08-11 21:52:39 my ap art teacher in high school wouldn’t even teach me to oil paint when I asked. Our class had maybe 10 people in it
7492 2018-08-11 21:52:31 Spill the oil
7493 2018-08-11 21:52:25 Unlike the Democrats who, with the Russia reset, acquiescing to invasions of Georgia, Ukraine, Crimea & Syria, refusing missile defense in East Europe and allowing Russia's use of the Oil & Gas energy weapon over the EU, set the standard for dealing with the Russia threat, right?
7494 2018-08-11 21:52:19 I can’t come to michigan this weekend bc my cars oil pump is broke 
7495 2018-08-11 21:52:17 Unadulterated coconut oil works wonders really tho
7496 2018-08-11 21:52:06 Precisely. Also, the money they generate form Hajj is nothing compared to the oil money they make via Aramco: 12 million barrels a day, generating over a billion $ in just one day. Now multiply that by 365, according to Forbes.
7497 2018-08-11 21:51:49 More Nat handbook shit ...
You do know a lot of oil money was used on Scottish infrastructure  ?
Here's one Joe ...Hollyrood 100m pa  what could that fund ..
Also your bollocks about nukes 30 odd mile from Glasgow .. Aldermaston  Porton down ...work that out .distance and populus
7498 2018-08-11 21:51:10 Mixx tea tree oil with lemon grass juice
7499 2018-08-11 21:50:54 I would be very grateful to hear that we aren’t associated with them in anyway anymore. This includes no more oil from them and no more sales of UAVs to them.
7500 2018-08-11 21:50:44 The last snake oil salesman did !! Just remember that !
7501 2018-08-11 21:50:43 I imagine west Texas as a land of nothin but cummins with def deletes and oil field trash stickers
7502 2018-08-11 21:50:36 Oya use shea butter. Since you don't want oil 
7503 2018-08-11 21:50:32 just go
7504 2018-08-11 21:50:31 I think terrorism would have been much less significant, if even existent, without oil, mainly because Wahhabism/Salafism would have not been as globalized.
7505 2018-08-11 21:50:23 Somebody oil my scalp
7506 2018-08-11 21:50:16 I want some maple honey oil
7507 2018-08-11 21:50:04 Well that's freedom for you. Not worth the smell of an oil rag to you perhaps? You know I was not trying to make a point about energy efficiency and light bulbs. But if we're on that subject, I don't see why you need be so pessimistic over our ability to manage such things.
7508 2018-08-11 21:49:55 I got you. Also don’t dry off when exit the shower. The oil locks in the moisture and your skin stays hydrated all day
7509 2018-08-11 21:49:40 Go follow @K_Kisner He’s leaking oil, could use a bump on the back 9
7510 2018-08-11 21:49:38 que mal va el mundo
7511 2018-08-11 21:49:31 If you have a diffuser put eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil and peppermint oil in it & helps a lot

7513 2018-08-11 21:49:14 Taste wayyy better I pop mine in olive oil so it’s healthy
7514 2018-08-11 21:48:55 Except Venezuela have oil revenue to rely on while Turkey is not a mining/ oil dominated dictatorship.
7515 2018-08-11 21:48:51 The Jamaican castor oil would prevent your hair from breakage and your hair might get so wild and out of control
7516 2018-08-11 21:48:46 Correction. Canada has mostly Bitumen which is high-sulphur content, not sweet crude oil and it is harder to deal with.
7517 2018-08-11 21:48:37 Fry a little garlic in the oil.
7518 2018-08-11 21:48:22 If few pieces of onions, a sachet of salt and power oil could be used to induce electorates to vote in favour of a particular Candidate in a bye election, that shows the depth of hunger and poverty in that state.
7519 2018-08-11 21:48:11 Plenty of oil with the herbs and garlic. It was pretty good

7523 2018-08-11 21:47:29 Love it Saw a fleet of them dealing with the Sea Empress oil disaster in Wales in 1996. Spraying detergents at low level!
7524 2018-08-11 21:47:29 Put olive oil in the ear?  Like I do?  Even tho I have insurance?
7525 2018-08-11 21:47:20 I used 6 shades of oil pastels to create that background and then used black and white paint over the oil pastel background. But i recommend you to use black granite aur charcoal pencil instead.
7526 2018-08-11 21:47:19 Nothing is new under the sun. I just finished reading Upton Sinclairs book Bunny Ross. USA 1920-ish and back then the oil barons of the time bought media, judges and politicians just like today.
7527 2018-08-11 21:47:18 @J_amesp Hi James, just read your Skada articles. They're keys to the problems of Europe! An important clue is the Scandinavian social politics, check out Ritt Bjerregaard, DK Politician once EU Commissioner. In the 70-90'ieas she mastered it to pour oil on troubled waters.
7528 2018-08-11 21:46:31 Death row meal: spaghetti, good olive oil, salt, red pepper, pat of butter, shit load of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

7533 2018-08-11 21:46:00 Wrong again, cause you don't read. Trump is doing what Stalin did & the Kochs follow Stalin's ways because their father worked for Stalin in Russia drilling oil & liked the way stalin ran things, letting his people starve to death, no health care, sending who spoke out to Siberia
7534 2018-08-11 21:45:48 Can't WAIT til Nov. oil tariffs go into effect! So THERE, Ayatolla & Achmidinejad, et al! Doomsday arrives.
7535 2018-08-11 21:45:48 True. I always feel like I'm going to the doctor when I get my oil changed, though. Maybe I'm conflating memories of my dad changing my oil and complaining about my car maintenance
7536 2018-08-11 21:45:43 i only use coconut oil, castro oil & tea tree oil for my dreads  oh.. lets not forget water the main ingredient

My roommate: no.. I think I ate that one ...
Me:
7540 2018-08-11 21:45:04 If u start your car and drive away in that bitch before ur oil is even a lil warmed up, u don’t deserve to own a car u fucking idiot
7541 2018-08-11 21:44:44 I've probably made the air and oil filters that company uses!

7542 2018-08-11 21:44:18 Lol we can always pretend it was oil and hope Sam comes back from the dead 
7543 2018-08-11 21:44:16 So my Rover dude is constipated. Just put some beef bouillon on his food and he gobbled it up period and gave him a stool softener. He itches like crazy all the time scratching, I just pulled out my coconut oil and applied it topically will see
7544 2018-08-11 21:43:52 Though I didn't agree with @BarackObama's policies, I never considered him a snake oil salesman.
7545 2018-08-11 21:43:48 Goals at this very moment: create a monopoly on I Ching websites, and own a coconut oil company

7550 2018-08-11 21:42:56 @theJagmeetSingh is a lightweight - saying that we shd buy foreign oil rather than use our resources that wd create local jobs is not someone that has Canada’s interests at heart. He’s actively promoting foreign interests. Suddenly Venezuelan oil is fine. What about human rights?
7551 2018-08-11 21:42:47 At the oil change place. Will I be shamed for waiting so long for my oil change?? I need to learn how to change my own oil so I do it in the privacy of my own home.
7552 2018-08-11 21:42:39 I liked cbd oil until I found out it can cure my hiccups....now I LOVE it
7553 2018-08-11 21:41:51 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil
7554 2018-08-11 21:41:49 (In the desert)
Me: I'll explain! I think I found oil. 
Madonna: Wanna play NES? 
Me: I just need some salt!

Connery is the only correct answer.

For an ill temperament. Eaten with cheese.

● 3 boiled monkshoods
● dash of duck
● 4 cloud beetles
● a flagon of oil of vitriol
● most of a toad

Eat it or clean the cauldron with it.

Enough for a horse.
7557 2018-08-11 21:41:25 That oil money loooooooong
7558 2018-08-11 21:41:24 Yes, we literally just discussed the fact that it’s prosecco as well. 

It’s been a good night. 

Martins beard oil is s celebration in itself.
7559 2018-08-11 21:41:16 I'll never understanding injecting oil. It looks fucking ridiculous. Why not just get on the juice and put the work in like the rest of us?

7563 2018-08-11 21:41:09 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7564 2018-08-11 21:41:00 Either I stubbed my toe in my sleep or I actually burned it with oil last night

7570 2018-08-11 21:39:26 How is Trump helping Putin?  Do the sanctions help?  Does chastising Germany for their oil deal with Russia help?  Does killing a bunch of Russian soldiers in Syria help?  Can you name just two things that demonstrate how Putin benefits?

7573 2018-08-11 21:39:20 I changed the oil in my Jeep yesterday. I could’ve let it drain into a Guinness Bottle and sold it as beer..

7580 2018-08-11 21:38:25 I mean considering Iain and Sam were both in there we would have potentially lost both of them then? Or is oil okay as long as it doesn't ignite right?
7581 2018-08-11 21:38:16 this #afflicted show on #netflix does a good job of showing the ups & downs of dealing with a chronic illness- the family and relationship issues, daily struggles and the random scams (poorly educated & lazy docs, snake oil salesmen, etc) that you run across during your treatment
7582 2018-08-11 21:38:00 @RepMarkMeadows ...WilmerHale billable hours should be based on results as w/any federal contract.  After 1/1/2 years nothing discovered w/in their objective, but billable hours, then its time to investigate lawyers fraud. No more Blue Sky or Snake oil fraud for money by Mueller
7583 2018-08-11 21:37:57 China folds to Trump's tariff & quietly removes OIL tariff - Unknown to most, China has become the biggest buyer of US CRUDE OIL EXPORTS, last year taking a 1/5 of the total - Trump's dealing with China, Russia, N. Korea & Iran while Mueller is dealing with a "witch hunt"
7584 2018-08-11 21:37:37 Data is the new oil
7585 2018-08-11 21:37:28 Well played @orlandopirates but @SuperSportFC were the better team. Also,left footed players and penalties are like water&oil. You have to be seasoned to kill them #MTN8

All you ReDixieCans suffer from the same mental disorder. Every negative you say about an opponent is a projection of what you yourself are or doing. I.e, snake oil salesman.
7595 2018-08-11 21:36:10 앗..아아 여행출발....
7596 2018-08-11 21:36:03  Kinda wish it was oil instead of blood tbh!
7597 2018-08-11 21:35:58 Same line up???  No runs for 19 innings and you throw the same damn line up out there??? WTF Coconut Oil Boy!!!!
7598 2018-08-11 21:35:56 Who in the hell wants Mitt Romney back? And yes, we do want Pelosi and HRC to go away. Not because of their age, but because they support war, the 1%, destruction of the environment, oil pipelines, droning the fuck out of people overseas, and other shit we don't believe in.
7599 2018-08-11 21:35:35 Guess it depends on the company your dealing with, and your attitude while dealing with them. We’ve have good luck dealing with company’s when there wanting to put in leases. But it’s oil not gas and could be different company.
7600 2018-08-11 21:35:34 Dude. Politicians don't buy oil. Also, wtf is clean oil? Is it like clean coal?
7601 2018-08-11 21:34:53 Beard oil sounds good. I’m  for a beard trimmer that will let me stay neat while growing it quite thick and long...
7602 2018-08-11 21:34:51 The whole idea of Energy East was not to supply Canadian refineries with discounted oil but to export non-discounted oil.
7603 2018-08-11 21:34:47 Speaking of snake oil salesmen, how much of Trump’s merchandise have you purchased? 
7604 2018-08-11 21:34:41 Lowe's, oil change, breakfast with some friends, and some clothes shopping. All before 1.
7605 2018-08-11 21:34:38 After oil, we'll all embrace true federalism.
7606 2018-08-11 21:34:21 I was excited to try the Ruby cocoa bean pink kit kat and was upset to see palm oil as an ingrediant. Surely an alternative oil could be used that causes less halm @KITKAT? #enviroment #savetherainforrests #animals

7608 2018-08-11 21:33:59 I’m seriously high just from the intense aroma of onions & garlic frying in olive oil & fresh liquified DOP tomatoes hanging in the air!!
7609 2018-08-11 21:33:45 CBD oil, Charlotte's Web, is hemp oil & is legal to be mailed anywhere. A couple droppers 1-3 times a day is worth a try. No THC, so no psychoactive component. I'm also no longer on zoloft & nortriptyline. So I think CBD is a great alternative med. Oh! no more IBS either. :)
7610 2018-08-11 21:33:40 Job growth slowed, real wages down, inflation up, interest rates up, oil up.  
Sorry, what’s working?

7614 2018-08-11 21:33:02 Tea tree oil is good bardo bas it will suck the moisture from your skin, aloe clears your skin while also keeping it hydrated & thank you hbb 
7615 2018-08-11 21:32:59 I wouldn't use prescriptive 'cat deterrent sprays', they're probably too diluted, that's why citronella essential oil is better, but on hard surfaces & not near the pond.
Not ideal, but could you put a protective fence/ structure inaccessible to cats around the pond at night?
7616 2018-08-11 21:32:43 Lol question. What really is maintenance on a car? Just getting a regular oil change right?
7617 2018-08-11 21:32:28 Has to be BS.
7618 2018-08-11 21:32:24 yes stop using that shit i stopped using that and i use castor oil on my hair it make ya hair grow back fast asf

7625 2018-08-11 21:30:58 Can we talk about how canola oil &/or apple cider vinegar is healing my eczema?! Can't tell if it was both or 1of these, but I tried it, & I can't believe how fast it's working. It's gone down so much...still itchy, but it's working so much faster & better than I expected! WHOA!

7628 2018-08-11 21:30:14 Neil, oil companies and their refineries make business decisions. Are we going to tell them where to get their feedstock from? We are a net oil exporting nation. We import here and export there.
7629 2018-08-11 21:30:09 ya had this explained to me now, looked like oil to me as it was pretty dark, probably my laptop screen being shit

7644 2018-08-11 21:28:25 u can use coconut oil to make it grow
7645 2018-08-11 21:28:12 True. Venezuela has oil but it needs to be highly refined and blended compared to Mideast oil. This adds to cost. How long will they be able to dodge their creditors who cannot grab the oil since Venezuela transfers ownership before shipping?

7658 2018-08-11 21:25:57 Hey, @CITGO and @PDVSA  Thank you for the fuel oil you have donated over the years to poor Americans. I had the privelege of managing your donation to the the people of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta several years back!
7659 2018-08-11 21:25:56 FIRST installment of China's capitulation-  they dropped tariffs on oil!!!! Can't run their airplanes! HOORAY! Donald J. Trump , @POTUS ! Wait til their people starve for lack of soybeans and corn!
7660 2018-08-11 21:25:49 Buy your oil somewhere else and leave Saudi A. behind
7661 2018-08-11 21:25:27 worse still, trudeau is subsidizing saudi oil imported for refineries in quebec,new brunswick,nova scotia...& these refineries went against pipeline east because trudeau won't subsidize canadian crude...meanwhile the st lawrence, bay of fundy etc are being soiled environmentally
7662 2018-08-11 21:25:23 Yeah. This country is only big enough for the current self infatuated snake oil salesmen.
7663 2018-08-11 21:25:20 trump does what Russia,SAUDI and China tell him to do.Remember trump said  he gave bribes to GOV. leaders and when he calls in FAVORS they do what ever the blank he says.Those who have loan (BRIBED)and funded him for years well they call in FAVORS.

7666 2018-08-11 21:25:01 Sure I did. They reversed a decision that’s only 2 months old and are now sucking up to Big Oil again. Not good.
7667 2018-08-11 21:24:45 The whole idea of EE was not to supply Canadian refineries with discounted oil but to export oil at a non-discounted price.
7668 2018-08-11 21:24:38 I love the smell of mustard oil.. equivalent to petrol for me
7669 2018-08-11 21:24:37 Having a car is a joke. 
Got my tires fixed to have to get my oil changed like the next week just for my air to go out. 
7670 2018-08-11 21:24:36 She's a snake oil sales rep selling a book to the low info crowd. Pure bullshit.
7671 2018-08-11 21:24:18 but friendly reminder from the beginning of the episode that ambulance was leaking oil... I know that might have been misleading on purpose but... this horror show might not be over... #Casualty
7672 2018-08-11 21:24:15 Sounds good
7673 2018-08-11 21:24:07 Well guys I got my truck fucking ready yesterday, carb, alternator bracket on. ONLY TO FUCKING REALIZE MY INTAKE WAS TOO LONG SO IT WAS BLOCKING HALF MY THREAD HOLE FOR THE OIL PRESSURE SENDING UNIT

7680 2018-08-11 21:23:21 Yeah..... can you? 40+ after finding oil ,a population of only 5 million and Scotland has food banks?
7681 2018-08-11 21:23:00 99% of the time they’re just using truffle oil which tastes rancid and contains zero actual truffle. Unless you’re paying $30 for those truffle fries, they’re not truffle fries.
7682 2018-08-11 21:22:50 がんばりましょー！
7683 2018-08-11 21:22:45 What data did you use for that statement?
Let me give you something to think about, Norway has an Oil Fund of £2trillion, how much has the UK Gov, with more Oil fields and Gas than Norway, managed to save? If Scotland was Indy ...... Eh!
7684 2018-08-11 21:22:45 I slice ‘em the other way. Coat em with olive oil and salt, Grill those bad boys.
7685 2018-08-11 21:22:10 I love cats, but agree, they're sods, the owners should call them in at night, for their safety & to keep nature safe.
Cats hate water: buy a water pistol, set up a handy hose & dowsing with a bucket of water helps. They also don't like citronella, the essential oil is good.

7689 2018-08-11 21:21:33 I would fry in olive oil just because it can be so expensive! That sounds correct, though, it sure does start to smoke faster.

7693 2018-08-11 21:20:35 For what it’s worth, your smug “our farms” view on agriculture in general disgusts me. Agriculture/commodities are and should be market driven, and safe from your political drama. As you clearly demonstrate in your recent hit piece on ethanol where you side with big oil.
7694 2018-08-11 21:20:32 Is there an essential oil to help ya stop being a bitch?
7695 2018-08-11 21:20:18 I took my wife to the Missouri State Fair today for our anniversary and got to talk to the owner of Dick's Corndog shack about High Oleic soybean oil, he advertised peanut oil. Will be checking back with him next year!

Tyranny wasn't actually the cause of Venezuela's collapse. Tyranny came AFTERWARDS.

Venezuela collapsed because of extensive socialism and over-reliance on oil.

7703 2018-08-11 21:18:33 Unfortunately, he spent most of his term being the first great neoliberal, and only started to come to his senses toward the end of it, which enraged oil money and neoliberals, and I'm sure is why they all rounded on him and slimed him.
7704 2018-08-11 21:18:28 The TSA lady took my Shea Moisture castor oil even though it’s been half used and was under the limit before I went on vacation!!!! I hate her
7705 2018-08-11 21:18:27 Apparently you should only use olive oil cold or if you roast things m, not to fry. It changes chemical properties. I have no idea if this is true, it’s just what I heard.
7706 2018-08-11 21:18:19 Hi Amy! Erythritol sweetener (Swerve) and coconut flour in place of wheat flour. Also has coconut oil instead of butter. Got the recipe from The Everyday Ketogenic Cookbook by Carolyn Ketchum. Making sugar-free PB cups next!
7707 2018-08-11 21:18:13 So, Trump still has the fake church leaders (snake oil salesmen) on his side.
7708 2018-08-11 21:18:12 So my top three favorite in no order. Apricot, avocado, and grape seed oil. Those are the only ones I’ve been using. I’m open to suggestions though. Do you have any?

7710 2018-08-11 21:18:00 Trump & the GOP's agenda is one that prioritizes corporations and the wealthy elite (which they ironically denounce) above the average American. They're most beholden to lobbyists and the industry, to oil/coal. Their regressive agenda is a hindrance to our country's progression.
7711 2018-08-11 21:17:54 ‘Oil’ 
7712 2018-08-11 21:17:52 No we wouldn't....as it wasn't Scotland's oil ...belongs to block holder..
You do know Statoil is state owned do you ?
And the cost of living in Norway ..
What is it with nats and the money from oil ....you wouldn't see a penny if even Indy..there are poor folk in Norway ..

7732 2018-08-11 21:14:55 The same things were said about the snake oil salesman who now holds the office.
7733 2018-08-11 21:14:44 You didn't answer my question: Why has Norway managed to put aside £2trillion in an Oil Fund while the UK Gov screwed Scotland and blew the whole bloody lot for over 45 years?
7734 2018-08-11 21:14:36 I had a dream where I was Max Caufield and I was trying to stop Luna Lovegood from smoking, and she's like "but I still need to sin" and just dumped a bunch of oil onto the road and threw her lit cigarette into it, killing multiple van-loads of people
7735 2018-08-11 21:14:27 It's as though all con men had figured that the most lucrative con is to get "elected" by corrupt #RedState #GOPFraudsters and make out like bandits on all levels.

7737 2018-08-11 21:14:02 Hot oil and a few seconds. When they stop sizzling they are good to go.
7738 2018-08-11 21:13:53 very interesting and you are very technically minded and interesting to learn from. Thank you
7739 2018-08-11 21:13:36 Speaking as an Eastern Canadian, I don't need you using my region to score cheap political points. If we have an issue re: oil we can speak for ourselves.

7744 2018-08-11 21:12:36 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

7755 2018-08-11 21:10:36 It is genuinely regrettable that the Middle East's oil reserve is as prevalent as Western Europe's white/WWII guilt. It gets in the way of logical relations
7756 2018-08-11 21:10:29 In reallity , It's not that simple, a chain is as strong as the weakest link.

7777 2018-08-11 21:05:59 True today as it was in the past. Maybe that's why war talk includes terms like "THEATER"... it's a show, contrived to achieve whatever Deep State Elites are after, the puppet masters. Reasons for WWI was bogus... ditto that for wars in Oil Country.
7778 2018-08-11 21:05:55 Dave, I think you’re really describing your buddy Donald. Arrogant, self infatuated, attention seeking snake oil salesman ... Yep, you nailed it!

7788 2018-08-11 21:04:01 The US is now the #1 exporter in the world and if not already, very soon will be the #1 producer. Economics will play a key roll in the supply of oil and the sanctions will also squeeze the economic life of the Mullahs. When they are gone, we will be there to help rebuild.
7789 2018-08-11 21:03:50 Instructions call for mixing 2 tablespoons of cooking oil and a half cup of water in the frying pan.
That doesn't seem right.
That actually sounds dangerous.
7790 2018-08-11 21:03:38 I rip up the mint and put into safflower oil (good for high heat), then marinate the squash spears in the mixture for an hour or so before grilling. The mint flavor gets infused into the oil... delicious!
7791 2018-08-11 21:03:20 “self-infatuated, attention seeking, snake oil salesman” he said with no sense of irony. Man, DeputyDawg is dumb.
7792 2018-08-11 21:03:20 Actually the CIA told Bush there were no verifiable WMDs, but Bush went and attacked Iraq anyway, because he knew if he destabilized the Middle East his family would make a fortune on doubling oil prices.

7796 2018-08-11 21:02:58 Yes but when we went into Iraq they said that they were going to bring peace to the Middle East because Saddam had to go. When really it was about getting all their oil. Our military died for contractors making it rich and oil. How can you feel good about that?

7799 2018-08-11 21:02:36 There`s a present Maisbrot craze this end. Pour quality olive oil on it and it`s heaven.
7800 2018-08-11 21:02:31 Girls will wake up , rub oil for body then take pictures just for the gram.. y'all doing too much for social media
7801 2018-08-11 21:02:01 Nigeria was the world's largest producer of palm oil. Nigerians abandoned palm oil because of crude oil.
7802 2018-08-11 21:01:43 Oh nah, Acrylics is the way to go tonight. Oil painting is cancelled.
7803 2018-08-11 21:01:36 We have a snake oil salesman as the sitting president right now. The best in his genre!
7804 2018-08-11 21:01:28 Talksport really have a problem with spurs doing well without spending oil money!
7805 2018-08-11 21:01:20 ATTENTION

Who on my friend's list uses CBD or Hemp Oil AND would love to test a brand NEW product for FREE? Benefits include... Better Sleep, Less Pain, Less Anxiety, and a BETTER YOU!! 
7806 2018-08-11 21:01:12 Today feels like the richest measure of the King’s holy anointing oil. 
7807 2018-08-11 21:01:05 GRILLED VEGGIE SKEWERS 
_______________________

In a small bowl mix, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 TBSP lemon juice, 1 TBSP oregano, 1 TSP salt and 1 TSP pepper. Mix with a fork. Take a wooden stick and add pieces of zucchini, mushrooms, red, onion and coloured bell peppers. And barbecue
7808 2018-08-11 21:01:00 Virgin organic coco oil all overrrrr. I feel so delicious lmao
7809 2018-08-11 21:00:44 @TheRoyGreenShow If I had the power ,I`d build Energy East to supply Eastern Canada with Alberta oil and I`d send the Saudis packing, ditto with Trans Mountain, Northern Gateway and Keystone , to add Asian markets! This would create huge steel demand, CANADIAN STEEL!
7810 2018-08-11 21:00:34 after reading that a few times and also reading @Bognoregis3 comment about we need to have sight of the pump. ...then we will have an idea of how much from the Portland.
7811 2018-08-11 21:00:28 Rt @alsanany2018 True. In da 70s, Kissinger mad a pact with Ksa, demanding they ONLY use $ in selling their oil, in return 4 protection
7812 2018-08-11 21:00:27 August 11, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
7813 2018-08-11 21:00:16 Hmm, Saudi Oil for CNY sales coming shortly?
7814 2018-08-11 21:00:16 Quiero q fuel oil me regale algo e ir hoy 
7815 2018-08-11 21:00:11 Brake and oil change. My car feels new 
7816 2018-08-11 21:00:11 I second this, tea tree oil has helped me with severe tooth pain. Just make sure you spit a few times after putting it on. You don't want to swallow it.
7817 2018-08-11 21:00:02 When you get a oil change tire rotation and full inspection and they say everything in your car looks great....
7818 2018-08-11 20:59:49 Cbd oil flavour?
7819 2018-08-11 20:59:31 Get Alberta selling their oil outside and within Canada and it helps all Canadians.
7820 2018-08-11 20:59:25 Ban all Saudi oil imports. Let's use Canadian natural resources.
7821 2018-08-11 20:59:16 Air brushed photos that look like an oil painting <
7822 2018-08-11 20:59:16 Just armorall it down, add half a quart of marvel mystery oil, and put a bowl of dry rice under the seat.
7823 2018-08-11 20:59:08 Trump as no name as a cup of oil he can't poor out people or himself trump is a drum and he has not a space
7824 2018-08-11 20:58:42 It is $4 billion a year which is a rounding error in Canada. We can buy oil anywhere and should. We don't need Saudi oil and in fact should not deal in it.
7825 2018-08-11 20:58:28 1) Rising rates impacting customer financing
2) Tariffs/input costs
3) Need to invest in EV/AV tech with no near-term payoff
4) 100$ oil!... talk about headwinds
7826 2018-08-11 20:58:12 Seriously...I don't believe graphs without a link to source.   We all know PC tanked Alberta economy by budgeting at $100 barrel.  44 years at the helm and they drove AB into the ground kissing up to Oil.  That is PC legacy NDP have had to fix and they are.
7827 2018-08-11 20:58:12 I have seen enough predictions of that we are running out of oil and they have all been wrong and if you review past history of fossil fuels predictions and compare to actual results they have been wrong due to new technlogy that came up and allowed more fuel to be found.
7828 2018-08-11 20:58:02 I think that's a new record. Changed my oil and only dropped one f-bomb in the process.
7829 2018-08-11 20:57:59 Let’s extract some Virgin Oil from your belly
7830 2018-08-11 20:57:52 Not true when you pull them out yourself you don’t have any it’s better if you go to the guyshay to take them off i pulled mines out with coconut oil I had very short eyelashes after that but they grow back fast
7831 2018-08-11 20:57:50 Somali sea pirates attacked our trades in the red sea since 2008 when you hijaked  Saudi oil ship in the red sea. and we said that those never represent the Somali people. So you attack us and then you hate us .....and we still do business with you .... do you have brain
7832 2018-08-11 20:57:47 Just saw a smoked WATERMELON ! interesting, I'll put that on the list of things to try. Brine in Coriander, Oregano & salt. Rub with Oakwood ash. Baste in Olive oil &Rosemary. if you try it, let me know how it turns out @Sarah_Gish @Chynableu
7833 2018-08-11 20:57:46 oh his stuff is usually delicious enough - i think it was the absolute MESS of coconut oil he used to soak up all the weed, it just made them SO oily. because otherwise they’d be a perfectly respectable tasting muffin-like item! just not a cookie.
7834 2018-08-11 20:57:43 We will need some oil during phase out. It doesn't bother me for one second if it doesnt come from Canada. You want us to pay the world price. Newfoundland oil ok with me.
7835 2018-08-11 20:57:36 Garlic, olive oil, salt n pepa, nothing special Lol
7836 2018-08-11 20:57:05 + 2 sachets of Power Oil naa
7837 2018-08-11 20:56:51 I almost got sent home today for throwing a oil cap at my coworker head. My manager agreed tho 
7838 2018-08-11 20:56:47 Abrahamic religion is nuts: 3 religions, thousands of sects, all worshipping essentially the same god in different ways, unable to go a century without war, incapable of being civil, and all competing over a tiny bit of “holy land” which (for the giggles) is where god put the oil
7839 2018-08-11 20:56:14 I prefer to call it "Swing Oil".
7840 2018-08-11 20:56:05 We can only CONVERT away from oil slowly over a 30 year period. We dont even hit the tipping point until 20 years when most energy is non-carbon. The point is to get busy. I dont want pipelines or trains so foreign oil, hydro, solar wind tidal must be brought on stream ASAP.
7841 2018-08-11 20:56:00 I'm curious if you are against doing business with regimes that have terrible human rights records. Is it ok to sell oil to China?
7842 2018-08-11 20:55:58 Ah, yeah, you need to change places dear.  Oil changes Do Not take that long.  Good Luck!!
7843 2018-08-11 20:55:48 IMO, CN has leverage with oil. CN can source from IR or US. US dom prod's will benefit if IR condi & LO is pulled from the mkt, & it would support WH (supposed) FP goal of a new nuclear deal w/ IR. Thus CN can offer to aid or hurt, by buying IR crude or US crude. WIFM is the CN ?
7844 2018-08-11 20:55:26 I can't imagine what it would be like to have a self infatuated, attention-seeking snake oil salesman as president.  
7845 2018-08-11 20:55:26 Vitamin E oil makes your skin glowing y’all no joke
7846 2018-08-11 20:55:12 Speaking out and also buying Saudi oil. Oh as well as having a weapons deal with them.
7847 2018-08-11 20:54:38 Lol did you know who saraki father was? and did you know saraki has an oil well?
7848 2018-08-11 20:54:29 Yes. Why not refine our own oil instead of exporting crude?  Doesn’t make sense at all.
7849 2018-08-11 20:54:28 Yup oil light
7850 2018-08-11 20:54:21 Need oil need oil  Need oil need oil   Need oil need oil  Need oil need oil
7851 2018-08-11 20:54:19 The lack of imagination is overwhelming. Tim Cook, Larry Page and Warren Buffett are among the least likely investors on the planet and they can seldom think past them, except for those moments when they imagine Saudi oil sheiks can bail them out. Incredible. $TSLA $TSLAQ
7852 2018-08-11 20:54:04 You know say if I break your heart na oil spillage #WeneMighty
7853 2018-08-11 20:53:54 Throw on some fresh mozzarella and olive oil you've got a capressa salad

7858 2018-08-11 20:53:16 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
7859 2018-08-11 20:53:16 My 9 yr old son just got me so bad. He asked me "daddy, is fish oil made from fishes?" I said yes. He said " so, if fish oil is made from fishes, what's baby oil made from?" The he started whistling the X-Files theme.
7860 2018-08-11 20:53:11 You were in Dallas? How much $ did they offer you to get you here? OR is the # because they are from Dallas? Obviously confused here because 1) you care only for your party, your Trump, the NRA, big oil, and large $ donors (as evidenced by your actions) AND 2) see #1
7861 2018-08-11 20:53:05 The morning after using rosehip oil my skin is HEAVENLY. I suspect that it’s helping me sleep better too. Wish I could use it every night but I fear it’s too rich for me. Oh, and I also use Mario Badescu products for breakouts.
7862 2018-08-11 20:52:59 Does anyone know how much oil Saudi imports ??  Why are we importing??!
7863 2018-08-11 20:52:56 If we are no more dependant on oil we dont need them anymore, they have nothing else to sell what we want or need, until then we have to be creative and developing solar and wind energy and H2 fuel. No more oil
7864 2018-08-11 20:52:51 Sending  please don’t forget the positive impact your honesty and openness has on others and how your talent inspires (I thought of you as I tried oil painting for the very first time today! ) x
7865 2018-08-11 20:52:45 Need a plug on the hash oil cartridges. Hmu if know where I can get some.
7866 2018-08-11 20:52:33 Chicken A La Heid followed by strawberry ice cream brandy baskets..
Score for the night......
9.7 / 10   Well done 
7867 2018-08-11 20:52:22 This also proves that he’s full of shit when he says he’s concerned about global warming or the environment. He’s just against Canadians producing and making a profit from oil and gas. Not someone else.
7868 2018-08-11 20:52:11 Na oil well?
7869 2018-08-11 20:52:11 Regardless the fact is Saudi is pumping billions in the Canadian economy.Saudi Oil could b sold anywhere
7870 2018-08-11 20:52:04 #Beauty #Tip
Instead of putting water on your BeautyBlender sponge applicator, put coconut oil on it - blends makeup AND moisturizes.
7871 2018-08-11 20:51:31 I'm pissed I can't find my Jamaican Black castor oil 
7872 2018-08-11 20:51:21 《オリーブ油豆知識》

酸化されにくいオレイン酸を多く含む
他の食用の油脂に比べて酸化されにくく固まりにくい性質を持っている
7873 2018-08-11 20:51:11 Tepid olive oil to soften. Do NOT  put any cotton buds, tooth picks or anything else smaller than your elbow down there. All that will do is cause trauma and/or impact wax further.
7874 2018-08-11 20:51:08 Breaking: 10 minutes ago, Curiosity detects presence of oil on the red planet. 5 minutes ago, U.S. declares war on Mars.
7875 2018-08-11 20:51:06 I smell like motor oil and does the inside of my car
7876 2018-08-11 20:51:04 Was it good ice cream, at least?
7877 2018-08-11 20:50:53 Corrupt Oil Money?
7878 2018-08-11 20:50:48 To whomever it was that was looking for older patches, they have some under the huge horseshoe in Lucas Oil (general DCI merch area) Not sure of all the years or shows though.
7879 2018-08-11 20:50:44 Duh. ;) What kind? I use CBD oil & it helps my Fibromyalgia, arthritis, Meniere's, migraines. I also rub CBC & CBD creams in my left shoulder for rotator cuff pain. Might be inflamed bursa, need an actual diagnosis, but the pain can be excrutiating. I rarely take NSAIDs anymore.
7880 2018-08-11 20:50:41 Thanks! Yeah gf massaged temples with essential oil & it was so helpful!!
7881 2018-08-11 20:50:39 Lol at the thought of Evo being a socialist in more than name and milking Venezuela's oil. Dudes reading communist propaganda from their iPhones while people keep starving in socialist countries.
7882 2018-08-11 20:50:27 Apply clove oil for instant relief.
7883 2018-08-11 20:50:23 Im a fireman 38 plus years not afraid of fire.had 2 engine detonations headers and oil  and one oil blew under car looked like carpet of fire i was racing on .waiting on funds for my new motor lol
7884 2018-08-11 20:50:12 Money money money , oil money. Is ther anybody there graduated from grade 5 seriously...
7885 2018-08-11 20:49:50 I've seen Jason Kenney and Brad Wall talking about finding alternatives to Saudi oil, but I truthfully do not know the CPC position on our forward action.
7886 2018-08-11 20:49:49 The oil companies have carved up the World in their quest for profit and now they're snatching our backyard for fracking.
7887 2018-08-11 20:49:36 damm....Katie is off for her physics degree ...another year she could have helped. Eddie and me believe it will flow more....
7888 2018-08-11 20:49:14 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
7889 2018-08-11 20:49:01 Niacinanide/zinc in the morning, salicylic acid in the evenings after using glycolic toner. But I also now double cleanse, and twice a week I forgo the acid in the evening and drench my skin in rosehip oil. Light exfoliating scrub the next morning. Good quality moisturisers too!
7890 2018-08-11 20:48:47 SWEET POTATOE FRIES
______________________

Cut up a sweet potato into frie form, add to a bowl,  add 2 TBSP of olive oil, 1 TBSP of rosemary, 1 TSP salt and 1 TSP pepper. Mix it with a  spatula till all the fries are completely coated in the mixture. And bake. (425°F, 25 min.)
7891 2018-08-11 20:48:25 Kool. I didn’t think about that. Did you know that tea tree oil does the same thing?
7892 2018-08-11 20:48:23 I'm tryna delay this oil change til tomorrow frfr. These folks too crowded.
7893 2018-08-11 20:48:09 Harda ke innit

7898 2018-08-11 20:46:43 my cat is going to be one of those essential oil cats that can distinguish between whether my scent is Hawaiian sandalwood or lavender meow mix
7899 2018-08-11 20:46:35 What can one cook with Onion, oil & salt? Can't make stew, can't even make soup either.

Gov. Yahaya Bello couldn't even add "Confluence Rice" to this. Couldn't add 1 egg, nobody is even asking 4. No protein whatsoever. 
This should be rejected. 

Kogi state is most unfortunate.
7900 2018-08-11 20:46:32 I Forced it what the peppermint oil in my hair mask
7901 2018-08-11 20:46:31 my wife got in a line that was an hour long wait for ice cream today. I was so annoyed that she would even get in that line
7902 2018-08-11 20:46:28 Well, I was in my favourite java place this a.m. and overheard similar BS. For all their patriotic support of the oil industry, a lot of Albertans don't have a clue about it, a fact that makes them open to simplistic appeals and political manipulation.
7903 2018-08-11 20:46:25 Really snake oil sales man applies  the the current President. Trump is a con man and a crook.
7904 2018-08-11 20:46:19 My car needs over $500 dollars worth of repairs but I’m going to pretend that I didn’t hear all that and stick with just getting my $20 dollar oil change
7905 2018-08-11 20:46:18 You are correct in your assumption "SCOTTISH OIL" is running out, but there is still loads of "BRITISH OIL" left in the North Sea....
7906 2018-08-11 20:46:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or back to work in their own country.
7907 2018-08-11 20:46:03 Congrats to Brian Elder on becoming the head scout for @OilCapsHockey  Brian loves the game, has a good eye and has an excellent understanding of player development. The Oil Caps are very fortunate to have him. Congrats to everyone involved.

7914 2018-08-11 20:45:29 Someone just lost a couple billion in oil?
7915 2018-08-11 20:45:23 After this oil change my car better not need or even think about wanting nothing else 
7916 2018-08-11 20:45:17 'The route of moose had worked near the attack...' ~this oil
7917 2018-08-11 20:45:16 As long as it will set well enough when it warms up, it sounds good to me. I also wonder if coating the silicone with a little oil would help it separate.
7918 2018-08-11 20:45:07 Yo @TomPerez nobody wants oil and gas companies funding political campaigns over here wake up !
7919 2018-08-11 20:45:01 Ya thats how the world laughed at city before oil money
7920 2018-08-11 20:44:51 You should have asked those questions in 2016 and if u did, apparently  u believed the lies the snake oil salesman in the WH told u.
7921 2018-08-11 20:44:49 We will see, you may be right but then twenty years ago, we were told about peak oil but that theory has gone down the toilet. We are producing far in excess what was long since forecasted. Technology has a mean to change things. You should spend time reading some history.

7923 2018-08-11 20:44:45 Standing in line in the Varied Industries building at the fair, with its wide variety of consumer products, I ask myself, Do I need beard oil?
7924 2018-08-11 20:44:43 warm olive oil might help shift it.
7925 2018-08-11 20:44:25 I think viewing Trump and Brexit through the lens of Russian information operations is like looking at WW2 through the lens of distribution of lubricant oil to allied aircraft in 1943.

It may be interesting but it's missing the bigger picture by a country mile.
7926 2018-08-11 20:44:11 I'm the best sister ever, I bought a special shampoo for my big bro because he has lately faced some issues and I helped him washing it with my own hands & applied him an essential oil for hair. I saved his life because hair is so precious.

7929 2018-08-11 20:43:33 My anxiety has been RUINING my life since my bottle of CBD oil broke I need to get more or I’m going to die
7930 2018-08-11 20:43:18 There is already massive foreign investment in Canada's oil industry. Soon none of the industry will be  canadian owned. He can limit foreign ownership and make it easier for oil companies to do business. They aren't opposing.
7931 2018-08-11 20:43:05 3p Home for 30 seconds now off to Toyota of Grapevine to get @SuperParentMom's van oil changed and inspected.  Trying to be a good servant husband.  *hehe*

This is what we call interference, encroachment in Federal parlance and they are unacceptable behavior 

North can resist all it wants. If ND ceases to be part of NG does the oil still belong to NG? NO...2/2
7938 2018-08-11 20:41:56 I worked at McDonald's for 2 weeks once and I was the cashier and fry girl. It was too much for me. Although my doggo loved the smell of oil and salt on me! 
7939 2018-08-11 20:41:53 Peppermint oil worked for me!  I mixed some with plain water in a spray bottle and thoroughly doused the trash cans they loved.  I also planted some mint in pots nearby.  Don’t plant mint directly in the ground though - it’s a weed that will take over.
7940 2018-08-11 20:41:51 Some ingredients seem good to me but I'll reduce the amount of oil very, very much unless I am making salad for an army... (maybe they are because they are A LOT of people who gather frequently); I'll trade the soy sauce for Worcestershire and  use sugar instead of honey (I love

7946 2018-08-11 20:40:58 What I want to say is that looking for His coming isn’t enough. We must abide. And there are many reasons people will fall away. The parable of the virgins is just one example. Why do you think they didn’t bring extra oil jars with them like the wise did?
7947 2018-08-11 20:40:53 Once their oil runs out they won’t be shit
7948 2018-08-11 20:40:48 Except Trudeau is making it harder for oil companies to do business in Canada.

7959 2018-08-11 20:39:05 They ARE INCREDIBLE. Grill the mushrooms with balsamic vinegar and pepper and oil and cut them up and put them in a bowl to sit with some homemade salsa verde. It looks ugly but tastes so good. I wasn’t sure how it would come out with just vinegar and pepper but oh man

7970 2018-08-11 20:38:11 Well when I come home, I’m telling him I’m tired of dressing in oil soaked clothes and maybe if I dressed a little nicer, I could pick up a nice woman. Maybe he’ll throw me that card too.

7982 2018-08-11 20:36:43 from the article it seems it was a dirty situation on all sides. The british sold out the arabs - Lawrence of Arabia, what they were interested in was the suez canal & oil control. As usual British troops bore the brunt of a nasty situation while politicians kept a safe distance
7983 2018-08-11 20:36:41 The USA is far from energy independent (we rely heavily on foreign oil), "riots" meaning protests against what people dont like of policies are still happening around the world against trump, immigration hasn't been changed and three bipartisan bills were vetoed by trump after he

7985 2018-08-11 20:36:36 R u kidding? What allows us to print the way we already do is the fact that our currency is a reserve currency and the fact that countries can't trade oil without transacting in dollars.
7986 2018-08-11 20:36:27 I got oil withdrawals
7987 2018-08-11 20:36:18 Put olive oil in pan, put garlic in pan, put green beans in pan, put pepper in pan, put balsamic in pan, put salt in pan, put brioche in toaster, put green beans on plate, put garlic sauce on toast, eat it.

7989 2018-08-11 20:36:12 Please combat these attacks, protect our oil & gas industry and punish Russia. Do not allow Trump to give Russia a pass while using these attacks to justify a massive citizen funded bailout of old, inefficient coal plants.
7990 2018-08-11 20:36:00 The all too easy unconscionable manufacture and proliferation of conspiracy theories a la @RealAlexJones @Cernovich abounds.  Political snake oil salesmen peddling ideology & slander rather than facts.  Would a real moral US president please stand up.  #idiocracy

7997 2018-08-11 20:34:52 Also Norway never entered the EU because it has a government who looks after its people. Until recently they were self sufficient with oil and gas so didn't need EU. Britain however needs EU because it has fuck all to offer in exports and 17M people were wrong thinking otherwise
7998 2018-08-11 20:34:51 Warmth. Try some warm olive oil on a teaspoon pour it in your ear and then put a  hot water bottle over your ear. It's safe so worth a try

8000 2018-08-11 20:34:31 It take pipelines to make panels. Industry kinda runs on oil.
8001 2018-08-11 20:34:31 Queer eye is just them going to the house and painting everything black, showing them how to cut vegetables and giving them beard oil
8002 2018-08-11 20:34:26 Irving said most of the oil from energy easy would end up being exported and not refined
8003 2018-08-11 20:34:13 La nation française est l'identité francienne (langues d'oïl) étendue à  l'ensemble de l'hexagone. La France est une nation au sein d'une plus  grande nation qui a pour nom Europe.

8005 2018-08-11 20:33:53 You don’t get it!
Eh, the money didn’t come from ‘skeptics’ per say! Jesus!

You seem unable to comprehend that the oil industry bankrolls reports that come out in their favour - are u really that naive! 
No need to answer that one.
8006 2018-08-11 20:33:52 Personally think we look to replace their oil with ours or someone else's.

答え.(C)
8008 2018-08-11 20:33:46 It is not so bad thing to make plastic from oil, if plastic is recycled as much as possible.

Most of oil is burned, it is stupid and causes dangerous global warming.
8009 2018-08-11 20:33:40 No it couldn't. The oil is a different type than what is current refined in East coast refineries. Would take millions of investment just for the refineries.
8010 2018-08-11 20:33:30 We changed clothes in the bathroom at Beef and Boards after watching the Million Dollar Quartet, now we're heading to Lucas Oil Stadium to see the #dci2018worldchampionships! #dci2018 #drumcorpsinternational Never slow down!

8012 2018-08-11 20:33:23 Does every attendee get a sample of BALCO™ Flaxseed Oil?
8013 2018-08-11 20:33:13 I need everyone to appreciate “McDohl I go for afternoon oil” like I do
8014 2018-08-11 20:33:08 When I leave DC, I promise ima miss my oil store the most
8015 2018-08-11 20:32:57 The disinformation campaign is a money grab by people in power. The oil industry is incredibly wealthy. Be serious about who’s motivated by money and power.
8016 2018-08-11 20:32:45 kind of ridiculous for them to take that long for an oil change.
8017 2018-08-11 20:32:26 He criticized Trudeau for making it easier for foreign companies to invest in the oil sands. Then criticized Trudeau for inaction for the oil sands.
Scheer’s only “platform” is anti Trudeau regardless of the message. This makes his message worthless bc it says nothing
8018 2018-08-11 20:32:22 I mean. Why even use quotation marks? Palm oil and aromatics are powerful agents to the uninitiated. *Bane Voice*
8019 2018-08-11 20:31:58 I think he means that the capitalist economy caused the oil to be formed and deposited off your coast.
8020 2018-08-11 20:31:53 Yes that will pour oil on troubled waters 
8021 2018-08-11 20:31:50 UK laws require full financial disclosure?   One would only wonder how much oil money he had received from the gulf monarchies.
8022 2018-08-11 20:31:42 A lot of people from my hometown are selling cbd oil. Like I can go to a store and buy that little tincture with 50/50 cbd-thc for 10 bucks. Your business model sucks.
8023 2018-08-11 20:31:38 I've heard olive oil is good
8024 2018-08-11 20:31:32 I think the two biggest two test are the Midterms (obviously) and our grumpy 4% unemployment economy.  Right now there is not enough labor supply but we are also seeing decreasing real wages (right now 70% oil prices).
8025 2018-08-11 20:31:28 But oil is OK  @DNC 
8026 2018-08-11 20:31:21 I just spent $40 on 2 essential oils and an essential oil bracelet... think I just made a good investment. 
8027 2018-08-11 20:31:13 Finally got an essential oil diffuser. I'm stoked to have a living room that smells like gypsy queefs.
8028 2018-08-11 20:31:12 Everytime I come get an oil change the price is more I don’t fucking get it
8029 2018-08-11 20:31:11 While the RNC is setting fundraising records and no its not from just large corporations. The DNC is going to suffer the consequences of their actions in 2016 for a long time and their need for cash is driving them to sellout to the oil and coal industries.
8030 2018-08-11 20:31:03 Man, stop. That’s like saying just forget that we murdered most of the Natives for this continent, or that we spilled millions of tons of oil and are killing the environment and should move on. Don’t be ignorant. History still happened. Learn from it.
8031 2018-08-11 20:30:42 Lol! Unfortunately it was a melanoma.  That’s what I get for using baby oil at the beach as a teenager. 
8032 2018-08-11 20:30:41 Drizzle oil and salt in the pan and use a paper towel to wipe it out. Leave it oily with seasoning. Should be okay.

8034 2018-08-11 20:30:35 Follow the money on this!! I'll guarantee it's not about the species so much as where the land that is protected for them and if BIG OIL money can dig & destroy it. Just sayin' #PelicanBrief

8038 2018-08-11 20:30:15 @theJagmeetSingh Canadian pipelines are crucial to our future economic success. Shifting who we buy our oil from and paying millions of dollars to foreign governments while our own Canadian reources sit in the ground is ludicrous. Be a true leader and support pipelines east&west.
8039 2018-08-11 20:30:07 Cbd oil. 
Is it shit or the shit?
8040 2018-08-11 20:29:59 It works for me but if you need something else try citronella oil, used to be able to buy it in Boots behind the counter or get online. My grandad was a forrester and used it, it's excellent & smells amazing if you like citrus x
8041 2018-08-11 20:29:28 Ugh for a moment I thought those were pine nuts and oil
8042 2018-08-11 20:28:53 LOL.. you visit the chakwal road in punjab you will find lot of boards of oil rigs. Even they are getting oil from one of my friend's land but they are not paying a single penny...
8043 2018-08-11 20:28:32 don't they know that olive oil makes the bacon not stick to the pan and removes the bacon fat and replaces it with good fat? these girls are so critical it's disgusting. NOTHING positive to say? ffs. #stopDomesticVIolence #BB20
8044 2018-08-11 20:28:32 Never tried oil but makes sense—use it as a solvent sort of for the oils from the peppers. I grow ghost peppers and Carolina reapers, and I absolutely only cut the reapers with gloves. Grinding dried reapers and Trinidad scorpions takes care too.
8045 2018-08-11 20:28:29 Yes :)

8048 2018-08-11 20:28:13 You want peace, yet every tweet you write is full of lies and hate! You put out lies about, Obama, Hillary and the FBI, DOJ anyone one trying to get to the truth! Your just a snake oil salesmen, nothing you say is true!
8049 2018-08-11 20:27:54 Yesterday I saw a product called "Cocavo": coconut oil mixed with avocado. Have we reached peak 2010s?
8050 2018-08-11 20:27:51 This dude at the gym looks like he dunked himself in a tub of oil before coming here to work out
8051 2018-08-11 20:27:47 Companies produce based on demand. Plastic is made from oil, or from plant products which require oil to grow/be shipped. The only way to eliminate company infrastructure you dislike is to encourage individuals to cut down on consumption.
8052 2018-08-11 20:27:23 Gotta get the synthetic oil when u get ya oil changed, they change them filters for you
8053 2018-08-11 20:27:13 The EVA NYC 10 - 1 Primer is amazing! Alternatively, if you aren't pleased with it and know a guy with a beard - it also makes a phenomenal beard oil.

8059 2018-08-11 20:26:42 LMFAO, You were duped by a career conman most people would've seen coming from a mile away but I'm the ignorant brainwashed one? Unreal. I'm from NY. I've known exactly who and what Trump is for decades. I also know the scum he attracts. You bought the snake oil. That's on you.
8060 2018-08-11 20:26:28 You sell snake oil while pretending to inform. What do you want to clarify?

8065 2018-08-11 20:26:02 The best is when you've been very careful to wash your hands with oil & dishwashing fluid after working with something very strong (for me it was grinding dried Naga Morich into powder) but still manage to get some lodged under a nail & then manage to discover it later, with eyes
8066 2018-08-11 20:26:00 Choc mouse with olive oil? It sounds gross. Do you use it instead of eggs?

8069 2018-08-11 20:25:32 Orange Buffoon is what he is. Snake oil salesman, no more no less. But I'm no psychologist — he is beyond me, in the land of confusion, stupidity, and survival instinct. I doubt he feels any true passions, that would require soul & heart, and he has neither.
8070 2018-08-11 20:25:31 Just got a massage with cbd oil and omg lemme tell u it was the best decision I’ve made in a while
8071 2018-08-11 20:25:22 I can suspend my belief.

The Woman who the paramedics talked too earlier jumped off a bridge, causes the Ambulance to flip with the same paramedics inside, which then caused an Oil Tanker to crash, which then caused multiple cars to flip might be taking it too far. #Casualty3006
8072 2018-08-11 20:25:10 Guy has pot belly and was representing my platoon cos commander threatened to put him in guardroom if he didn't. At the time dey rubbed oil on everyone his stomach became very obvious he made efforts to suck it in to no avail
8073 2018-08-11 20:24:57 I love my oil diffuser it really makes me feel like a person who has their life together for some reason
8074 2018-08-11 20:24:55 Unlike socialist countries in Continental Europe under the yoke of Communism and dictatorship for a large amount of time. Post war free money ran out & there was an oil crisis in 1974 - EU has been worst performing part of the globe since. In your life, debt spending is a blip

8076 2018-08-11 20:24:41 Nie to see The Iron Men from my neck of the woods. Aword of warning to those with dogs PLEASE Take Care palm oil seen on beach and dogs are attracted to it with fatal results.
8077 2018-08-11 20:24:34 It's vile the way he has presented those figures.
The Christmas bonus and back to school payment are once a year, not weekly. And the fuel allowance won't even buy a bag of coal. At least it's better now it can be got in a lump so people can buy oil or a load of turf. 1/2
8078 2018-08-11 20:24:28 loki uses thc oil in his vapes, how else do you explain his ridiculous antics
8079 2018-08-11 20:24:22 Just sprayed washer fluid all over my face on accident and the oil change guy goes “you know, your face looks good when it’s dripping with fluids” can I quit now

8082 2018-08-11 20:24:17 Ugh having sautéed 1/16th of zucchini, I discover MrB tossed the pre-fab in oil garlic.   He is a kitchen neat freak.  It was unsightly.  My feeling?  That a private part of fridge prone 2 chutney & other one-offs, and my garlic jar
8083 2018-08-11 20:24:02 Me and John Heid. I called him as it was getting busy. We appreciate youre thanks.
8084 2018-08-11 20:23:47 And don’t send our oil to the US to be refined. Refine it ourselves and let them depend and on #SAUDI oil.
8085 2018-08-11 20:23:45 Money. Lots of it. Oil. Lots of that too. All very short term and vert vested interest of course.
8086 2018-08-11 20:23:41 Oil & Money the root of all evil.

8088 2018-08-11 20:23:07 His parking lot is covered in oil now too. lolz
8089 2018-08-11 20:23:03 They were looking for him. They had some oil to start with in their lamps, or else their lamps wouldn’t have been running out around midnight. And they were devastated when they heard, “I do not know you.”

8094 2018-08-11 20:22:40 Everyone’s out getting drunk & fingered & I’m sat here with coconut oil my hair, a joint, a cup of tea & reading a book on death row inmate’s last words & meals.
8095 2018-08-11 20:22:29 Message of first @DNC resolution to coal miners, refinery workers, oil and gas production workers, utility workers was "we hate your industry so we refuse industry $$." Doesn't work to then say say "oh, YOUR money is OK. But we still hate your industry." Not an inclusive message
8096 2018-08-11 20:22:25 I would rather have integrity than friends.  Ever think other countries don't speak up because they need the one thing we don't.  Oil.

8101 2018-08-11 20:22:17 I like this technique?  How did you use the toothpicks?  For sgraffito or to spread the oil pastel in fine lines?
8102 2018-08-11 20:22:02 maan U can’t talk slick shit to a can of oil
8103 2018-08-11 20:21:49 my grandma, after opening a gift of hand lotion: "them na know I does use coconut oil?"

8106 2018-08-11 20:21:38 Most Americans have no idea that the demise of the petrodollar is the end of their financial power. The USD is oil backed, not by gold, so nations trading in other currencies ends the fees going to the US  economy.
8107 2018-08-11 20:21:38 I had to stop using last year because I started taking a controlled substance (Ritalin) and my doctor has to drug test me. But I have a friend that grows the BEST stuff I've ever had, and I've been using, on and off, for 50+ years. Bud only, no oil.
8108 2018-08-11 20:21:24 So i spilled motor oil all over the pavement entrance to our garage.. that explains how my day is going...
8109 2018-08-11 20:21:19 Our government needs to support Canadian products as we well know they're doing a piss poor job in this area unless it stinks of oil

8113 2018-08-11 20:20:49 Love it!  How did you use the black and white paint and oil pastels together?
8114 2018-08-11 20:20:49 Yes, one day the worlds economies will run on another energy source (possibly hydrogen/fusion) - but for the next century or more - we will depend on fossil fuels- natural gas, oil and coal - with solar and wind adding to the mix -

8119 2018-08-11 20:20:14 They are NOT “pasteurized whole eggs, modified food starch, soybean oil, natural flavors, sodium acid pyrophosphate, carrageenan, flavor enhancer (salt, maltodextrin, natural flavor [plant source], spices, herb, turmeric [color]), monosodium phosphate, citric acid, soy lecithin.”
8120 2018-08-11 20:20:10 So, ypure arguing both sides here...either past presidents DIDNT, or they (obviously ) did. Point being: you CANT divest from movie royalties, BUT real estate and Oil you CAN and HE LIED ABOUT IT.

8125 2018-08-11 20:19:21 looking at dubai and other oil exporting countries, one begins to wonder if it's groundnut oil or coconut oil that nigerian is exporting
8126 2018-08-11 20:19:20 When you trim your beard, tidy up, clean up, moisturise, maybe even add some oil. Have a feel and then notice that there are a few hairs that you missed. #heartbreaking
8127 2018-08-11 20:19:11 Where does everyone think this money is coming from? We aren’t owned by billionaires or oil nations, JB pumps money in all the time just to keep us in the clear and we haven’t sold any players for any real money in a long while.

8139 2018-08-11 20:17:49 I used to use proactiv and felt like it worked but after a few months every time I used it my skin would get really irritated. Now I use some Mario badescu products and they seem to help & also tea tree oil masks
8140 2018-08-11 20:17:46 @TweetingBandit have you let your country-mates that the global price of oil is dropping while the price at Kenyan pumps are slowly shifting upwards. Remind them to wait for le next round of massive job cuts and pray that they are not direct hits though they will still be victims

8160 2018-08-11 20:14:31 So I got assaulted by a man over a dog related incident. He threatened me, kicked me, hit me, poured olive oil over me and doused me in water. Police doesn't arrest him, talks about seeking mediation with the precinct officers, warns me of the consequence of filing a report.

8163 2018-08-11 20:14:20 Let’s see how Iran manages when oil exports are curtailed in November and riots against the geriatric Mullahs increase.
8164 2018-08-11 20:14:14 Stood in line for 30 minutes to request an oil change. Then left and ate lunch, got a pedicure, helped my mom pick out new glasses, wandered all of Walmart, and 4 HOURS LATER...just now starting on my oil change. 
8165 2018-08-11 20:14:13 It was cool though, after busting up the core a little bit, there was actually oil collecting in the core casing. Literally seeping from the rock!
8166 2018-08-11 20:14:00 Got my tires rotated, changed my oil and took care of the rear differential. I feel like I have a new car 
8167 2018-08-11 20:13:56 Yeah we're rich on oil, but we kept that wealth by being socialist, as in the oil is "owned by the people" and our oil fund is used on welfare, pension etc
8168 2018-08-11 20:13:54 A HANGOVER? Noooooo..... I'm sorry! I'm doing fine today, though I definitely didn't get to at 7am to take my car in for an oil change LOL

8174 2018-08-11 20:12:13 @grazedotcom stop using palm oil in your products. Palm oil may be a cheaper option for you but it’s destroying rainforests and killing animals. Please use more environmentally friendly ingredients in your products
8175 2018-08-11 20:12:03 No it doesnt. If we arent willing to use whatever limited muscle we have then whats the point in opening our mouths. 

The NDP has now said we should cut off Saudi Oil imports, is it the position of the Conservatives that we should cut all trade with them off as well??
8176 2018-08-11 20:11:56 To be fair, the price of oil was the main driver. The politics might be keeping it down though.
8177 2018-08-11 20:11:31 In the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas. CO2 is released as a bye product.

8187 2018-08-11 20:09:46 @asda Please stop using palm oil in your products. Palm oil destroys rainforests and kills animals. Just because it’s a cheaper oil choice doesn’t make it ok.
8188 2018-08-11 20:09:37 Do you understand that inequality in that scale is not healthy for any economy?  The 5th largest oil exporter is going to collapse?  I really don’t have much more patience Salih.
8189 2018-08-11 20:09:35 Ron Clark: major Russian troll... I've seen you trolls going after environmental groups alot lately- we know how much $ is made off oil. And Russia and trump are getting together to make $. The more oil is consumed the more the Arctic will open up to more drilling...two for one.
8190 2018-08-11 20:09:06 Depends on the year of the car and if you use synthetic oil. Here in Germany almost every car uses synthetic oil. But back when I was home, I used regular. Synthetic oil you have to change every 6-8k Miles. Regular oil, change every 3k. Also, check your trans oil as well.
8191 2018-08-11 20:09:01 Oil from Scottish waters which was exported from North Sea.

8193 2018-08-11 20:08:36 Sorry if the truth hurts. The group being oppressed is by their own rich oil brethren. Stop using the Jews as an excuse. I know it still makes most uncomfortable that we rose from the ovens, prospered and succeeded.

8197 2018-08-11 20:07:47 Wait, so if you park on the street or an hour or 2, you have to plug in so the oil and gas doesn’t freeze?
8198 2018-08-11 20:07:44 The kind of stuffs our politicians share during election campaign, feels like they re using the brains of the collectors for rituals.

Why will u give me salt ,palm oil and onion.

Like ,we be ancestors ?
8199 2018-08-11 20:07:43 Last night I nearly poured myself a full glass of spiced oil thinking it was some kinda fruit punch. The pizza place was awesome but clearly I shouldn't be out in public.
8200 2018-08-11 20:07:33 @NutellaGlobal due to the use of palm oil I won’t be buying it anymore #deforestation#orangutanstolive

8207 2018-08-11 20:06:20 This has to be connected to the BP oil spill

8214 2018-08-11 20:04:32 Caution 39-@RyanSiegRacing slow on the track with reported oil on the track. @AustinCindric still controls the field out front. #NASCAR #XfinitySeries #MidOhio #RocknRoll170 #RyanSieg #AustinCindric
8215 2018-08-11 20:04:28 I should add to that the writer of the article also mentioned the difficult combination of preferable Saudi crude coupled with the complex oil pricing, not in Canada’s favour.   Pricing discount for our oil seems politically insurmountable   Over to you if you want Rick.
8216 2018-08-11 20:04:27 NDP were anti pipeline & anti oil sands before they came to power in AB. Soon, they realized supporting oil sands is critical to their survival. For Jagmeet Singh on other hand courting anti pipeline, socialists, anti police & anti Canadian is key to his survival. Popcorn time!!!

8218 2018-08-11 20:04:22 Just saw a show about how palm oil is destroying forest habitats and in turn killing orangutans. I'm boycotting the use of palm oil and I'd encourage you all to do the same.
8219 2018-08-11 20:04:14 If  your budget allows buy another vehicle that is a hybrid or electric. The oil companies have been holding Americans hostage since 1970s manipulating the price of oil. Plus we are contributing to the troubled Middle Eastern countries that are oil rich; reason we went into Iraq.

8222 2018-08-11 20:03:44 "Yeah. Placebo pills and snake oil don't really *hurt* anyone after all. What's the problem with gains from the sales of false hope? Those people would buy it anyway."

Her argument is so atrocious that applying it anywhere else yields absurdity.

8225 2018-08-11 20:03:08 I was just at the car wash I was getting mad cause the oil field workers and a man was taking forever to vacuum cause I needed to vacuum ugh
8226 2018-08-11 20:03:01 I think they prefer you keep your oil in Alberta.

8228 2018-08-11 20:02:55 Yes, because shipping oil by rail and truck is safer and cheaper somehow.
8229 2018-08-11 20:02:52 We understand that there's oil on the track, supposedly from the 39 #NASCAR
8230 2018-08-11 20:02:49 olive oil

8238 2018-08-11 20:01:53 Olive Oil is really that gurl 

*throws coconut oil out the window*
8239 2018-08-11 20:01:52 Ron Wyden and the Democrats conspired to increase utility bills by shutting down coal, oil exploration, oil pipelines, and fracking which led to an explosion of clean cheap natural gas, but okay.

8245 2018-08-11 20:01:22 first of all this is not news faux. second. olive oil doesn't have cholesterol
8246 2018-08-11 20:01:21 Relations with Iran would have started to normalize as trade increased. The religious faction hates the west, not every Iranian. They have over 10% of the world's oil reserves & need a market. The deal was working, they weren't violating the terms, there was no reason to pull out
8247 2018-08-11 20:01:20 How many oil well does the North have to dominate the board of directors..

8250 2018-08-11 20:01:05 did they find a new source of oil?
8251 2018-08-11 20:01:03 Leffen, I recommend you to study about Processed Food=junk food and Nutritional Foods on YouTube for you never get sick again.
And watch videos about: boiled egg( one of the best food in the world), coconut oil, broccoli, fruits etc...

8262 2018-08-11 19:58:59 Put it in before the oil gets too hot
8263 2018-08-11 19:58:31 Need is a strong word but that $30 premium for full synthetic oil is worth it for any car. A Honda us a foreign too.
8264 2018-08-11 19:58:18 Boring .. you'll be saying oil money next
8265 2018-08-11 19:58:07 What credential does she had to be on the board of directors of NNPC while those who own the oil are no where to be found.

Thatbman will know no peace.
8266 2018-08-11 19:57:35 Oh. My. Gawd. 
Dude just came into DJs and picked out six porno-magazines (after going though each, and every one), seven oil burners, and eight lighters  
So, somewhere some crackheads are having a poppin’ jerk-off party 

8267 2018-08-11 19:57:28 eli took my car and got the oil changed, picked up parts i needed, and also surprised me with my fav blizzard  i’m so lucky omg

8276 2018-08-11 19:56:14 Aiiiiight I’m sitting here getting an oil change so it’s time to randomly ask questions on twitter. 

So....fellas, if a girl can’t cook, you still dating her?
8277 2018-08-11 19:56:07 Then Oil workers have been misled. The Continental Shelf has no British Sector. It has a Scottish Sector. It has an English Sector. Hence Donald Dewar and Labour did an administrative transfer of part of our sector to Engerland..

8281 2018-08-11 19:55:15 Tip for my few anxious artists:

At least for me, using diffuser with lavender essential oil makes me feel pretty much better on those days where I’m nervous.

8282 2018-08-11 19:55:07 Groundnut oil still has value... When I think of the oil, I'll surely react. Lol
8283 2018-08-11 19:54:59 For context, compare 6/70,000 annual police deaths from all causes to fishing: annual deaths of 52 per 100,000 workers; construction: 20/100,000; logging: 33/100,000; mining/oil:46/100,000.  Policing is pretty safe.

8285 2018-08-11 19:54:00 Sure, but "which is better, the Toyota Camry or motor oil?" is still a question that lacks a meaningful answer.
8286 2018-08-11 19:53:51 Sadly, Omarosa's eye for racism is made from the exact same Snake Oil Sales"man/women" skin!!  If Trump's a racist....what's that make her?  If I were Black, I would be outraged!!!

Canada produces the cleanest and most humane oil in the world. We use oil to build hydro dams. The profits go to public education where masters students learn about sustainable energy. 
It is happening now.
8298 2018-08-11 19:52:53 Ahaha baby oil or nah? Ahah

8306 2018-08-11 19:51:11 People make incredible sums of money from oil. So much money that they started a disinformation campaign against science. We know this, we have their emails about their conspiracy.
8307 2018-08-11 19:51:01 Aight so cash app you 20$? The oil n the legume bet
8308 2018-08-11 19:50:50 Insulin, the light bulb, the pacemaker, standard time, zippers...it's actually a pretty long list. What has Saudi Arabia contributed again? Oil and funding for terrorism?
8309 2018-08-11 19:50:38 Yeah, had this discussion in 1992 before I PCS'd to Japan ,and after getting some time in the sand box in Saudi. Still have the scar from the oil can from when we landed home.

8314 2018-08-11 19:48:34 Oil tanker got stuck again at underpass in Lahore again. Y these wise traffic specialists do not move this height bar a bit far from the underpass so even if some high vehicle hits bar,will have time & space to stop before hitting & damaging under pass 
8315 2018-08-11 19:48:13 If the middle and upper middle class dont exist anymore,  who is paying the taxes?
8316 2018-08-11 19:48:12 Doesn't help that every country bends over for them just because they got oil. Bring on the times when all vehicles run on electric and oil usage drops drastically enough to topple their empires!

8320 2018-08-11 19:47:31 Yep. If we're truly serious, cut off the oil imports from Saudi Arabia. Doesn't mean much otherwise, does it?
8321 2018-08-11 19:47:27 Wish I could remember who said it first. The elites will trade and control the BTC- wagging the market just as u said, while we all focus on the flashy objects being wagged (alts) to do every day business with. Just like JPM parking tankers off oil off shore.
8322 2018-08-11 19:47:25 You should fly over sometime and take a looksie into my car's insides. I bet the oil inside can talk by now. ;)

8327 2018-08-11 19:46:25 Cannabis oil is terrific for relieving pain. I fell going downstairs a while back, bruising shin area of one leg. My husband  said canna oil wld help but I didn’t believe it. I rubbed some on my leg anyway & I was very surprised at how much it helped!
8328 2018-08-11 19:46:18 I like a gallon of vinegar and about a cup of orange oil. Works like a charm and doesn’t clog the sprayer.

8330 2018-08-11 19:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or – and who we are fighting for.
8331 2018-08-11 19:46:00 You guys, it’s raining out our way. All the oil on the roads will rise to the surface so drive with extra care.
8332 2018-08-11 19:45:58 Black poverty increased from 25% to 29% under Obama. He was a snack oil salesman. I cannot for the life of me figure out why the blacks were drawn to him, when he increased their dependence on the government (buying votes), and racially polarized America.
8333 2018-08-11 19:45:57 DM your pics,choice n preference
8334 2018-08-11 19:45:52 The biggest special interest is the oil industry. Dimwit.
8335 2018-08-11 19:45:46 And buying votes? There is not a single republican with over 10% of his campaign funding from small individual donors! What are you, living under a mountain? No no wait, I know, living under a Koch brother funded oil pipeline sludge. Only way to justify thy ignorant bliss #REDBUM
8336 2018-08-11 19:45:45 Once you & @MelissaMWear find an animal for your daughter, you'll just gradually incorporate it into your life. It just happens. Never thought I'd have an oil painting of a flamingo for my dining area but parenting surprises happen.
8337 2018-08-11 19:45:42 pretty sure i’m allergic to the facial oil i swore by. every time I put it on my eyes don’t stop watering
8338 2018-08-11 19:45:24 Never heard of gel, I use oil and cream, but yeah, definitely use something.
8339 2018-08-11 19:45:16 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8340 2018-08-11 19:45:15 Bye Harley. I like my Honda and Kawasaki, they are both manufactured in the united states and start everytime. I can change my oil for less than I can buy a Harley T- shirt.
8341 2018-08-11 19:44:59 Two things I hate paying for is my phone bill and oil changes

8345 2018-08-11 19:44:23 Oh please!
8346 2018-08-11 19:43:54 What happened is that oil revenues dropped, so Osborne increased tax - charging more tax on less profit. Swinney you asked him to reset the rate to what it was as he felt that Osborne was killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.
Swinney was the more fiscally conservative.
8347 2018-08-11 19:43:51 Yep. An oil leak is an oil leak...after all, it’s just motion

8356 2018-08-11 19:42:14 I think we do. We do need to be able to refine our oil.  It looks like the private sector wants to prioritize exports instead of providing gasoline and diesel for our domestic consumption. Do you think the government should invest in refineries?
8357 2018-08-11 19:42:04 if u wanna spend $$$ and get the real deal u need something enriched with oils, my favorites are papaya, avocado and aragon. you need conditioner, never skip conditioner and you need to moisturize ur hair daily since curly hair is dry by nature, vatica oil replacement is good
8358 2018-08-11 19:42:03 @PmoTrudeau  If Saudi  removes  the  students  from  Canada,  then  we  should  stop  buying  their  oil

8361 2018-08-11 19:41:33 Do you not understand that if we go in and be provocative towards the Russians about Crimea they could see that as an act of war. We said we wouldn’t accept the annexation @SecPompeo   Booming economy, tax cuts rolled back, regulations to provide our own natural gas and oil ,NOKO

8364 2018-08-11 19:41:14 ..so why would he want to protect wild animals, plants etc. He has no sympathy for people unless they're businessmen so why would he care about the wild unless it can be used to make money somehow.

8365 2018-08-11 19:40:57 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
8366 2018-08-11 19:40:56 Why would you assume complex/long term treatments? Homeopathy is snake oil, water, a dangerous,  deceitful fraud. How could it reduce the need for further NHS treatment. How many people took that choice and returned to conventional medicine too late? Proponents should be jailed.
8367 2018-08-11 19:40:56 I'm gonna make CBD oil though. I don't want to smoke it or add to cooking. The CBD oil cuts out most of the TSH. I want just the oil for pain.
8368 2018-08-11 19:40:54 To appease their anti capitalists business hating oil hating base.   Red meat for the lefties!

8371 2018-08-11 19:40:41 If we had the facilities to get our own oil to our own market we wouldn't need pander to the Saudi's at all. I am supporting our PM on the rights issue but cannot forgive his economic ignorance that doesn't allow us to get our own product to our own consumers. This can be fixed!

4. Introduce Trading War - cause hysteria
5. Cause Wall Street Collapse

7. Use hedge to buy up stocks

8382 2018-08-11 19:39:07 CBD oil is something that big pharm want to hide, it works, has no THC or minor traces and is side effect free. Great for bad backs and knees as far as my experience goes.
8383 2018-08-11 19:39:02 i’ve had an infection in my throat for months no antibiotics have helped it.. do u cbd oil or certain foods could help?
8384 2018-08-11 19:38:50 It was Swinney that called on Osborne to lower the tax on both the oil and gas industry.
8385 2018-08-11 19:38:47 Hope the PM crane doesn't leak oil on bluebird the ones we have at work on our trucks leak fluid everywhere
8386 2018-08-11 19:38:43 Good luck tonight to ya RICO!
8387 2018-08-11 19:38:42 Your hero is a starter of all projects but not a finisher, thus it took the pdp regime to start Abuja metro line but it took PMB 3 yrs complete it. Your hero crashed our reserves when oil price was highest, but PMB built it back to $47 million.
8388 2018-08-11 19:38:30 Pour some oil on it too, Poole just love  doing that 
8389 2018-08-11 19:38:27 Anytime. I’ve also heard it said: the 21mil BTC is a barrel of oil. An unrefined product not for the masses. “Gasoline” will be for the working man. Define as u will. Second layer solutions? Alts? Ect....
8390 2018-08-11 19:38:21 Oil tankers can be 10m+ but this type is actually only less than 2m. Quite a difference in our stability when the water ballast tanks are empty and the cargo tanks are full though meaning much less of a roll. Much steadier and more comfortable thankfully.
8391 2018-08-11 19:38:00 The real question is why would you ever handle hot oil with a shirt on in the first place? Seems counter productive.
8392 2018-08-11 19:37:53 @MissThickLips3x she got some oil for booty crack
8393 2018-08-11 19:37:17 Eureka, this is too perfect.

8395 2018-08-11 19:36:51 This particular salesman is touting snake oil and bogus palliatives. He doesn't even drink wine, for God's sake. Even Jesus would take issue with that. Trump is already on my Shit-list, a simile I am sure he can understand. He's an imbecile, idiot, tyro, failure and a cur.

8398 2018-08-11 19:36:15 Just remember to fry zucchini first in olive oil until it starts to get translucent before adding the honey and dill. Otherwise the glaze evaporates and dries out.

8403 2018-08-11 19:34:56 IMF; China yuan accounts for less than 1.4% of global foreign-exchange reserves and under 2% of global payments; when China insists on payment in Yuan 4 its goods & services & reduces its imported energy (gas & oil) needs this situation should change ?

8406 2018-08-11 19:34:22 Pure Clove Oil.. is very beneficial for a  toothache. The oil will numb the area that you apply it to. The pain does go away for awhile. I don't wanna say it'll burn but its warm, the smell is strong.
8407 2018-08-11 19:34:22 People who work in the oil and gas industry in Alberta sink to some really absurd levels of cognitive dissonance so they never have to realize they can do other jobs that might possibly pay less. Vilifying the basic human decency policies of the NDP because you want an ATV is sad
8408 2018-08-11 19:34:09 Aww I’m sorry. I don’t take pain meds and tea tree oil saved me when I had all 4 wisdom teeth out at the same time.

8425 2018-08-11 19:31:09 Being nice goes a long way ... the dude at the place who does my oil changes was super nice one day, so I wrote a compliment for him and it turned into a big promotion for him
8426 2018-08-11 19:31:08 Importing oil and exporting our money! Needs to change
8427 2018-08-11 19:30:58 This morning I put a quart of oil in my engine and refilled my wiper fluid, all without spilling my Big Gulp.

Got my bacon on carbs.

8463 2018-08-11 19:28:17 I think the best way is to apply oil before u shower with anti dandruff shampoo, that way your hair doesn’t lose moisture and dandruff also gets removed.

8482 2018-08-11 19:25:00 There still is a chance. Invest in clean safe transportation choices like electric rail, buses and ferries plus cycling and walking so people aren’t forced to use oil from Saudi Arabia or anywhere else.
8483 2018-08-11 19:25:00 I was looking at an RS3 Saloon but I did hear about a few people having problems with the amount of oil changes it needed and one even saying that they did not get any warning until they could smell it!

8491 2018-08-11 19:23:47 Pipelines are 'more safe' than tankers, rail & trucks at present but that is not the bottom line.

8498 2018-08-11 19:22:43 If oil companies colluded to keep prices artificially high, the NYT would rightfully be screeching about the illegality of their actions. Why do social justice warriors think the rules never apply to them?

8500 2018-08-11 19:22:30 God punish poverty 

See what Gov Yahaya Bello gave his people
 3 onions,a sachet of salt and power oil.

Who did this to us?
8501 2018-08-11 19:22:28 Apparently we do actually carry it. Is a mix of butter and canola oil that's made to be easy to spread. Is kinda expensive :/
8502 2018-08-11 19:22:26 Coconut oil works great!
8503 2018-08-11 19:22:02 Anyway I love all the nubian coconut oil queens out there wakanda forever xx
8504 2018-08-11 19:21:57 @Walmart why is your Beaufort, SC (Robert Smalls Pkwy) location car center always so sloooowww. Waiting over an hour just for an oil change.
8505 2018-08-11 19:21:50 Now that we are officially the party of Big Oil, man am I psyched to vote Democrat! I'll canvass, donate - whatever it takes! Nothing fires up the base like making sure YOUR corporate donors can keep screwing us...thanks Tom!

8515 2018-08-11 19:19:45 Putin wants sanctions lifted so he can frack in peace and get that tax free oil
8516 2018-08-11 19:19:41 I've said many times: I *wish* big oil were funding me-- those guys pay really well! Hey big oil, if you're out there, my lines are open!

8520 2018-08-11 19:19:04 It all comes down to MONEY i think. Whose money is more important. Whoever want to come to Canada's aid has to weigh in the economic implications of losing Saudi money(oil).

8522 2018-08-11 19:18:53 Hi Nick, with all due respect, I was friends with Max. He was one of three researchers at the time discussing the black oil, that supposedly killed him. He was worried about what he was looking into and knew he was in danger. Where is your information coming from?
8523 2018-08-11 19:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
8524 2018-08-11 19:18:37 They taste awful. Like very old oil. Wendy's and chick fil a have the best fries by far
8525 2018-08-11 19:18:31 i am covered in so much tanning oil i have created an oil slick on my body which has killed many insects
8526 2018-08-11 19:18:28 checked the oil in my car yesterday & been driving around but just now realized I never closed my hood all the way 
8527 2018-08-11 19:18:25 It should be legal would help so many people. I don't smoke it but would be good in oil form for my arthritis
8528 2018-08-11 19:18:20 What say you? And I might invite others on this question as well- what if the gulf never found oil? @SomaliAthiest @salwabintk @Caliiyocabdi @MahirAbramo @ConfessionsExMu @Yaanyuurow @AbuClapback
8529 2018-08-11 19:18:11 Pakistan rejects discovery of oil reserves near borders with Iran
8530 2018-08-11 19:18:04 Holly crap, Saudi oil does have pull with big oil who control governments!
8531 2018-08-11 19:17:55 Please be discreet ! 
Turkey has no oil and no natural resources and yet they surpassed all Arab countries. You should be ashamed and shut up once for all. Turkey keep growing with or without sanctions, and with or without coup attempts. An idiot like should just shut up. 
8532 2018-08-11 19:17:50 Running out of oil is what enemies have been praying for centuries
8533 2018-08-11 19:17:48 Get a good mustard and saltines. Maybe mix some olive oil, capers and lemon with the mustard and dollop on the cracker. Let me know how it goes!
8534 2018-08-11 19:17:27 They believe snake oil salesman is a legitimate career choice, where a chat with a priest can obsolve their sins and the poor victim either earned being swindled or can request reimbursement in the afterlife.

8537 2018-08-11 19:17:03 Hello I need an oil change
8538 2018-08-11 19:16:56 I thought it was just salad without dressing. If you want to try it out later, try using oil of dried tomatoes, the grape tomatoes (or dried tomatoes if you prefer), parmesan and basil instead of the Cesar dressing. Add some sliced carrots. Maybe an egg. :)
8539 2018-08-11 19:16:53 2 tablespoons baking soda 1 table spoon veg oil couple small drops of dish soap mix and apply on the leafs with a sprayer every 10-14 days. It raises ph of leaf surface to discourage blight. A prevention more then a cure. Once the plant has the blight there is no stopping it.
8540 2018-08-11 19:16:45 Oh totes. IS is a more poignant issue atm b/c there aiming to steal entire countries and make a state- again all this is hardly new and you still haven’t answered my original question- which was if the gulf never discovered oil would we still see terrorism? Some would say, yes...
8541 2018-08-11 19:16:40 Aww, missing that sweet oil money already?
8542 2018-08-11 19:16:29 Alaskans own 5,303 shares of ATWOOD OCEANICS INC, worth $50,538. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

8544 2018-08-11 19:16:21 Can’t trust people who eat salads without oil and vinegar or dressing
8545 2018-08-11 19:16:08 Is the the coconut oil and charcoal stuff?
8546 2018-08-11 19:16:05 Very nice massive oil on canvas. Perfect for farmhouse style. Set of two.
8547 2018-08-11 19:15:56 “I feel like I’m giving him factor 50 and he’s just giving me tanning oil, I’m burning here” best thing I’ve ever heard honestly
8548 2018-08-11 19:15:55 I can’t remember my multiplication table but I can remember that in Zelda TP lantern oil costs 20 rupees and red potion costs 30 rupees
8549 2018-08-11 19:15:54 I refuse to adhere to your straw man and ridiculous premise.  I prefer our military not be sent to die for oil or whatever idiotic reason politicians fool you into thinking we need to be overseas.

8551 2018-08-11 19:15:41 I can help there. It's a fallacy that Canadian oil and gas is heavily subsidized.  People pushing this narrative point to CDE and CEE. However, CDE and CEE are in fact depreciation of energy investments (say drilling a well). Every single industry depreciates tangible assets.
8552 2018-08-11 19:15:32 A band director friend of mine who is involved in DCI just wrote, "In the past two days I've spent more time in the Lucas Oil end zone than the Colts did all last year."
8553 2018-08-11 19:15:08 I was thinking about doing this too.. So glad to see it working for others. Any recommendations for brands of Vapes or Oil that works best? I'm newly diagnosed so new to all this!

8556 2018-08-11 19:15:04 Is it palm oil free?
8557 2018-08-11 19:14:53 One thing listening to your podcast has really convinced me of: we absolutely should nationalize the big oil companies as both a moral and practical matter.

8567 2018-08-11 19:12:52 I'd guess you could mix the spices with a bit of oil/sauce and make an impromptu marinade, but then the meat would have to soak it in for at least an hour
8568 2018-08-11 19:12:52 And sharia is clearly unconstitutional. Between sharia and taqiyya, I’m not sure how the followers are allowed to even run for office here honestly. Some big oil $ has changed hands to have officials turn the other way is my guess.
8569 2018-08-11 19:12:26 Wow! Natural gas is just as dangerous… If not more. Thanks for clarifying its fracking! I hear Sunoco and think oil/petrol.

Again, we have so many options so much better and safer for the environment, but these greedy bastards don't care as long as they make bank.
8570 2018-08-11 19:12:17 production of OIL in the MIDDLE EAST at any and all cost necessary to do so, and they have FAILED  miserably, with the help of the UAE they had,even planned to attack  QATAR, it was TILLERSON and GENERAL MATTIS  who stopped it, they didn't give a damn about the 10+Thousands
8571 2018-08-11 19:12:16 Banana Republic?  Chump wants to turn America into an oil state.  Rolling back common sense in order to expand fossil fuel exports.  Western half of American is on fire while chump has his fraudulent corrupt racist head up his ass pushing ignorant denials
8572 2018-08-11 19:12:09 They who must be obeyed, aka the M/E oil 'consortium' , have their fingers in our financial pies.

8575 2018-08-11 19:11:38 Do you keep it clean? I am guessing that you don't let the oil and sand create a paste and damage it.
I use the Dura-Ace chain on the 11 speeds, the KMC X10EL Np for the 10 Speed CX and a Shimano HG95 10-speed on the MTB.
All work well if kept clean.
8576 2018-08-11 19:11:15 Face oil
8577 2018-08-11 19:11:11 Haven't eaten all day. Just fixed me some boiled plantains. Too lazy to make sauce, red oil all the way.
8578 2018-08-11 19:11:08 How did we get here? It started with trickle down  economics, the dumbing of America , 3rd party Trojan horses, GOP and Trump selling their souls to the devil; financed by big oil, and a fat lazy America, who won't even vote. We are getting what we deserve: THE BEAST.
8579 2018-08-11 19:11:06 I am just down to the stuff from cement and oil now ... then I might grind ascension mats tbh ... I have 105 hearts but I need seeds and lancer gems so I am a bit torn ... I might farm enough lancer gems to finish up tamamo and then go hit seeds or something lol ... choices!

8581 2018-08-11 19:10:59 Was any oil spilled? If so, how much?
8582 2018-08-11 19:10:43 وكم سعر هالزيت؟
8583 2018-08-11 19:10:41 I slice them fairly thick and dress with olive oil, salt and a little cayenne pepper. The heat complements the sweet nicely.

8586 2018-08-11 19:10:09 @graze is your palm oil sustainably harvested?
8587 2018-08-11 19:10:08 True! But that would severely let down the foreign funded special interest anti-"Canadian oil" groups,eco-zealot politicians+citizens and instead benefit Canada's economy as well as a large number of (media ignored) First-Nations peoples who get employed by these energy projects

8591 2018-08-11 19:10:02 Please cut off our oil. Humans are lazy and innovation only happens when necessary or if there is money in it. It would be painful short term but we would never rely on oil again.
8592 2018-08-11 19:09:58 I wonder what his favorite brand of snake oil is...
8593 2018-08-11 19:09:48 They would do better WITHOUT big oil money. The time is LONG overdue to reduce big oil’s influence. Stop sounding like a Republican. Raise money from the PEOPLE.
8594 2018-08-11 19:09:41 Real story is trying to help Putin enter Nuclear power industry in Middle East.  Also kick back off the tax free oil flowing threw Ukraine and Crimea.  Hence sanctions asked to be released
8595 2018-08-11 19:09:31 Oh boy oil light is acting funky so I fe….
8596 2018-08-11 19:09:28 currently 10 minutes into oil pulling on my teeth and I have to say this is actually so disgusting but I can’t stop since I’m committed now

8598 2018-08-11 19:09:11 YOUR  here pic is almost 20 or + years old CHINA. Along with big oil, energy and drug co. LOBBYIST'S not to leave out the DMC. THEY HAVE ALL TAKEN ADVANTAGES OF THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR OWN GAINS. BITCH ABOUT THAT WILL YOU? OUR GOVERNING BODIES SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT & UNTETHERED!
8599 2018-08-11 19:09:02 Wasn't an anti oil rally. It was one of series of rallies for the environment.  She's also not bound by federal NDP policies.   You can't find a single example of her saying anything anti-energy, can you?  :D
8600 2018-08-11 19:09:02 Nair and baby oil, hunnyyyyyy 
8601 2018-08-11 19:08:53 And yet you continue to stand in the way of life saving CBD oil. You’re a hypocrite and you need to not be pretending to represent Texans. #TX32 Anyone who cares about people will vote for @collinallredtx
8602 2018-08-11 19:08:44 Let the county government invest some of the oil revenues to upgrade educational infrastructure.
8603 2018-08-11 19:08:38 I get payed on Tuesday and I’m excited to be able to get an oil change. 
What kind of adulting is this
8604 2018-08-11 19:08:35 Pence was a shill & moral sell-out as governor of Indiana, bought very cheaply by corporate donors: tobacco industry, oil industry, pharmaceuticals, health insurers. He remains a shill thru & thru. Bought & paid for by  #ThugInChief  & GOP overlords.
8605 2018-08-11 19:08:31 Am not seeing the diagrams in them but i will advice you check you oil and make sure there is water in the radiator so it won't be like it's warning you about the temp
8606 2018-08-11 19:08:28 Also try coconut oil on it.

8610 2018-08-11 19:07:56 Ever fry zucchini in honey, dill and olive oil? You’d be a lot cooler if you did.
8611 2018-08-11 19:07:49 My coconut oil jar is the only weather forecast I need
8612 2018-08-11 19:07:47 here they go telling me my engines about to fall out. just change my oil and mind ya business!!!
8613 2018-08-11 19:07:43 I only use olive oil
8614 2018-08-11 19:07:43 Well according to @Ocasio2018 the evil Jews are occupying Palestine so she probably agrees with this.
8615 2018-08-11 19:07:36 car cleaned and oil changed 
8616 2018-08-11 19:07:29 Finally did my car’s oil change and man this new oil feeling never gets old 
8617 2018-08-11 19:07:18 How is Peterson less "woo woo" than Chopra. Snake oil salesmen both, just selling different products.
8618 2018-08-11 19:06:56 I hate getting oil changes. This is worse than being at the nailshop.
8619 2018-08-11 19:06:48 You know the party for the National NDP isn't so smart after all Mr. Singh, wants us o buy oil from other countries Why, doesn't he know we have the 2nd most oil reserves in the World, buy OIL HERE IN CANADA.
8620 2018-08-11 19:06:43 @JustinTrudeau is doing what many of us have said for years must be done:Publically rebuke regimes which destroy human rights+freedom of religion,demean women,kill gays.But his stand will only succeed if we+other nations quit importing their oil.
8621 2018-08-11 19:06:40 My car pissing me off today I was suppose to spoil myself but instead I had to go put gas, get an oil change, buy a new tire, and she still needs a major wash  I need a blunt dis tew much
8622 2018-08-11 19:06:33 I once wrote a dissertation on the oil potential of the Irish border around Fermanagh.  It had/has some potential . You could declare independence and become a damp version of Kuwait
8623 2018-08-11 19:06:06 I wouldn’t buy a brand new car from you, let alone a used one.  You’re just a grifter and a snake oil salesman.  You have no credibility.  If your lips are moving, you’re lying.
8624 2018-08-11 19:05:51 Your MCM changes his oil every 6000 miles.
8625 2018-08-11 19:05:47 Seeing wah Qatar nd Saudi Arabia are doing with their Oil Money makes me wonder if Ghana nd Nigeria re selling Coconut Oil  .
8626 2018-08-11 19:05:41 Where do you get the oil? I'm down to try something new for him
8627 2018-08-11 19:05:24 Safe to say, Mr. @theJagmeetSingh skewered himself and scared away a lot of voters in his tight byelection with his poorly planned “buy oil, just not CDN oil” comments to the CBC. When you pull the trigger, ya gotta make sure the gun’s not pointed at your own foot.
8628 2018-08-11 19:05:20 Sorry, I should have been more specific. I’d like to see where all the alleged tax credits are for oil and gas companies. I keep seeing this perpetuated, but I can’t find facts around it.
8629 2018-08-11 19:05:18 Raise horses & hopefully strike oil
8630 2018-08-11 19:05:18 only in Oil City 
8631 2018-08-11 19:05:11 Everyone looks great in this pic but it’s soo old Saxib, everyone was liberal then- was oil discovered around the time of this pic or nah?
8632 2018-08-11 19:05:06 I have the black caster oil but not this brand tho
8633 2018-08-11 19:05:06 Argan oil and coconut oil worked for me 
8634 2018-08-11 19:05:04 See that’s the thing , I love Chick fila and apparently they cook with peanut oil or use to . It never made me sick though as child either 
8635 2018-08-11 19:04:58 Gravlax > Fish oil > Scombroid food poisoning > Methylprednisolone > Alpha-Lipoic acid > Prasterone > Allopregnanediol > Androstenedione
8636 2018-08-11 19:04:49 I've read this a million times but I've never seen instructions on what exactly to do with the oil. Ingest it? If so, how?

8640 2018-08-11 19:04:13 This is war. GOP winnng with Koch oil money is not better than Democrats supporting good environmental laws winning with oil money. I am fine using oil money to promote solar and wind energy.
8641 2018-08-11 19:04:01 Complaining of more poor people while importing more poor people. A negative demographic.
We problem with people having the skills, education to compete in 21st century economy. One more demographic that is changing.

8647 2018-08-11 19:03:26 —Less Shampoo
Ig you’re shampooing daily, it will do your hair no good but actually remove the natural oils in your hair and dry out your hair much faster.
Curly hair needs the natural oil that your scalp forms. Instead, shampoo every few days for the better benefit of your hair!
8648 2018-08-11 19:03:16 And Canada  will cut off you f’ing oil lol

8656 2018-08-11 19:02:16 The beauty of being a female: I brought my car to the Benz dealership today to get my window fix & a oil change. And the man paid for all my work for me bc he want to take me out  #LookAtGod 
8657 2018-08-11 19:02:16 I slept and am feeling more cheerful. Though, I've fed a mosquito this morning. Now to find and kill it. -slathers on lavender oil- Bugs. I hate bugs.
8658 2018-08-11 19:01:49 Or too scared to stand against the M/E oil sheiks and their potential for taking their ball in - financially speaking - whenever anyone does not 100% suck up to them?

8661 2018-08-11 19:01:31 Another important rule learned today is to never ever put oil in a dishwasher.
James should learn as many never-evers as possible.
8662 2018-08-11 19:01:30 Couldn’t see that, are they really oil drums?
8663 2018-08-11 19:01:29 Who will be poor, will be poor. Even with many States getting their share of oil revenue, they still cannot pay salaries, pensions and gratuities.
8664 2018-08-11 19:01:14 Oil play? I haven’t but looks interesting ..will do some dd when the weekend settles down.
8665 2018-08-11 19:00:53 Is that an oil to put in there

8670 2018-08-11 19:00:29 My dad would shun me if I used regular oil over synthetic 
8671 2018-08-11 19:00:28 I think anyone who has business experience knows what you’re trying to say. Points 1 and 2 are compliments. And they should be taken as such. Also, employees get paid well who are decision makers, not those who aid oil to the process.
8672 2018-08-11 19:00:22 Bringing such a story adds no value to the nation. I wish you brought a scientist from KALRO, ICIPE, KEMRI who are really burning midnight oil to save lives. Or a reformed criminal. Waste of time

8683 2018-08-11 18:58:39 Once Alex Jones gets banned from Twitter, there will be a vacuum of crackpot conspiracy theories, so I'd like to submit myself for consideration to fill that ducking void. Theory the First: Big Oil is to blame for dirty dishes!
8684 2018-08-11 18:58:32 The secret to a great stir fry is not to turn on the heat, just stir the meat and veg around in a cold pan full of oil for 10 minutes. Sounds weird but trust me
8685 2018-08-11 18:58:28 That hypothesis cannot be falsified in Caracas cuz: 1) There is no water; 2) Motor oil is too expensive. Venezuelans will never know if water and oil can be mixed.

8688 2018-08-11 18:58:01 The funny part here when see all this tweets  u start believing Canadian people living out of the reality of this world and they don’t know basic things about their country it’s real when u ask the your Gov , to start using their own oil it’s really show how u stupid ignorant 
8689 2018-08-11 18:57:58 Easy, zealots are sheep with no mind to think on their own. They're easily manipulated by snake oil salesmen like Graham, who just uses it to get rich.

8698 2018-08-11 18:57:01 Seriously. Like, I'm trying to be polite, but... it's... how do I say this.

It's amazing how someone can have this sheen of snake oil over everything they do, this very well-crafted veneer of slime, and -- how some people still just don't seem to be able to see it.
8699 2018-08-11 18:56:53 My apartment has moved up from “jar of coconut oil is permanently liquid” to “taking out my garbage every day because it immediately stinks” levels of heat.
8700 2018-08-11 18:56:17 I need to have the color right before I leave for Canada, but I tend to drench my hair in coconut oil the first few days, then once a week until the color fades out.

8702 2018-08-11 18:55:50 Thanks for the clarification, now it makes scenes since the China oil import growth is definitely slowing down because of the cooling economy.
8703 2018-08-11 18:55:48 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
8704 2018-08-11 18:55:36 Shea butter + my fruity leave in conditioner + coconut oil + castor oil, mixed together is doing WONDERS for my hair. So excited!
8705 2018-08-11 18:55:32 It contains all necessary nutrients….
Once they run out of oil, they will be still fine.
8706 2018-08-11 18:55:26 Badly implemented Socialist policies.
Like, don't base your entire centrally managed economy on the state-owned oil company. They just needed to do that, and maybe this might be 'real' socialism (it's only real when it works, oddly enough).

8709 2018-08-11 18:54:42 Will do! As long as marijuana is legal in your state you can probably get it or something similar. The CBD oil I have been using has really cut down on the swelling.

8711 2018-08-11 18:54:00 Yummmmm i just read the reciepe if covan salatsi and it sounds like it would be perfect i would personally skip the olive oil but thats a personal taste thjng
8712 2018-08-11 18:54:00 Really. That's pretty cool. 
I've been on either tramadol or codine & strong anti-inflammatory meds since I was 18 so 15 years now and recently tried some CBD oil. I'm interested as a proper alternative.

8718 2018-08-11 18:53:38 [Snorts a laugh.] Alright. Flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, unsweetened cocoa powder, sugar, vegetable oil, coffee grounds, milk, eggs, and vanilla. [He was counting on his fingers but was one short, so he has to use his tail to count the last.] That’s for the cake. -
8719 2018-08-11 18:53:29 Thank you for taking the time to listen! Much appreciated!

I don't understand why when we have renewable energy options, we continue to invest in dangerous oil pipelines, which not only harm the environment and our planet, but they harm human beings!

 Money and greed.
8720 2018-08-11 18:53:29 Sir, don't you think that will encourage sluggishness on the part of non oil producing states to develop their economic potentials? knowing that whether or not they do, there's still a National cake waiting for them
8721 2018-08-11 18:53:28 And so, as a result, you don't have oil companies controling your politicians and your Natives' lands and rights are not encroached upon, right?

8728 2018-08-11 18:52:56 What is actually happening in Venezuela is that oil prices plunged due to fracking technology. There is a group of elites in collaboration with the US who want to exploit the countries resources for the benefit of themselves and multi-national corporations.
8729 2018-08-11 18:52:52 "Hello Mr. / Mrs. Customer i understand you waited for a 4 hour oil change, but hows about you hook me up with an all 10 survey" lol what a joke

8777 2018-08-11 18:46:49 Wickedest Jab is them Jab that does run away from Church Camp to preach ole oil Monday morning! #Izwethadey
8778 2018-08-11 18:46:47 the whole oil control line from ole henriksen has helped with my acne!
8779 2018-08-11 18:46:47 discovering oil washing is probably the best thing I could've done for my natural hair.
8780 2018-08-11 18:46:47 You're still free to do whatever though. In countries that are poor to start, socialism makes them poorer. In countries like Sweden it takes longer. It has started though. Sweden didn't get wealthy through socialism. They had a lot of oil. Now they are starting to feel the burn.
8781 2018-08-11 18:46:33 If we don't invade the middle East for oil then whyd we go into Iraq in 2003?
8782 2018-08-11 18:46:31 Avocado oil and olive oil is Heaven for my hair 
8783 2018-08-11 18:46:16 It’s honestly embarrassing that Canada is alone against the Saudis. My country and many others are too dominated by oil to speak up, and would rather side with a near-terrorist organization than one of its closest allies
8784 2018-08-11 18:46:15 Oil dos not make money it hasn't for 2 plus years
8785 2018-08-11 18:46:01 One straight up told me that she does not scrape hash oil off of surfaces. Had to go with a different one

8787 2018-08-11 18:45:45 This $10000 debate disaster is really getting out of hand. We're gonna need Trump to tweet something really outrageous soon to put an end to this. You know, like using explosive to extinguish an oil well fire...
8788 2018-08-11 18:45:41 My skin is drier than Death Valley so I use pure Argan Oil for my lotion nowadays and it’s changed everything! I buy it in the essential oils section at the local hippie grocery store, no fragrance.
8789 2018-08-11 18:45:41 Totally agree with you about the market influence,  if oil prices had been above 100 dollars per barrel TransCanada would have proceeded with the project. Point the finger and shrieking it was Justin's fault just keeps the CPC base happy
8790 2018-08-11 18:45:39 week of 8/13: oil's drop and then turkey panic shook out some longs. looking for early week relief rally esp in energy, banks and chips to push dow higher early week (tech/software not looking as good) to set up some bearish divs for a decent pullback with QT wed
8791 2018-08-11 18:45:33 I didn’t expect an oil company to defend a terrorist like Juan ...
8792 2018-08-11 18:45:26 Thats why Bush was protecting his Assets from Qatar during The Sand War for Big Oil.

8800 2018-08-11 18:44:26 Time for Canada to start using our resources to produce the thing we need in Canada for Canadians. Oil? Yes. Wood products? Yes. Food? Hell ya. Fresh water? Yep. A few key areas where we need to regain our sovereignty. The world is suddenly to volatile to not be self reliant.

8807 2018-08-11 18:43:16 Without OIL, #SAUDI is NOTHING. So their arrogance is just as big as their weakness because they desperately need recognition. Still, they are just a Dictatorship whose wealth comes from the OIL and NOT from their intelligence or hard work @TheEconomist @business @businessinsider
8808 2018-08-11 18:43:12 Damn I do love olive oil and adobo....I might have to try

8810 2018-08-11 18:42:22 It’s disgusting it does. Yemen doesn’t have the oil Saudi has. Does not have the arms deals that Saudi does. That is why the West is doing nothing.

8832 2018-08-11 18:39:59 Americans have no idea as to the criminal ways of oil companies, and I have to assume it's because their money is buying journalists who know.

8840 2018-08-11 18:38:51 Haha! So for clarity, because he works in oil and gas he doesn’t give a shit? Why do you assume they are mutually exclusive? Do you think trains and trucks are a better way to deal with fossil fuels for our environment? And the ‘whatsboutism’ speaks to your hypocrisy.

8856 2018-08-11 18:37:08 The opinion I most strongly hold that is probably the most incorrect is that there is no difference between sunflower oil, canola oil and vegetable oil.

8867 2018-08-11 18:35:29 There's also a need to follow the money. I remember @Funmilola asking once about the profits from the slave trade, there was such a massive trade back then where's the money?  It smacks of the same thing happening to oil exports...

8880 2018-08-11 18:33:36 there is a reason we are buying oil from SA, Nigeria and others ..Canada 's railways are either clogged with  grain or oil ?

8896 2018-08-11 18:31:10 I agree with the cetaphil oil control wash! It doesn’t feel like much when you put it on but it’s amazing. Their lotions are also awesome because they don’t over moisturize and fight acne!!

8900 2018-08-11 18:30:35 Ok. This is really sad. Nigeria is the biggest economy of Africa. Your country has so much of potential. Plus you have oil reserves.  Your country should have been one of the richest in the world. In India we had the same problem, but now PM Modi's govt is doing wonders for Us.

8905 2018-08-11 18:30:14 Why can't the refineries use Nfld oil? Or how about Norway, Brazil, Mexico? 

Face it, greedy oil companies prefer Saudi oil and that has nothing to do with us.

8907 2018-08-11 18:29:41 They sell oil in dollars, exchange it to riyal at black market rates.. give the gov riyal as if converted at official rates, the difference is their corrupted profit.

8910 2018-08-11 18:29:17 yup solar power combined with wind farms, and hydroelectric power, will eventually replace the need for most of the worlds oil consumption, leaving the Arabs, and other oil producing countries, in need of an alternative source of revenue

8912 2018-08-11 18:28:28 Because the UK sell arms to Saudi Arabia and get their oil from them. So they won’t say anything, same with America. The only country who has said anything about it, is Canada. Am afraid that to many countries around the world, care more about money, then innocent lives. 
8913 2018-08-11 18:28:22 Shitlibs noticibly silent about DNC taking oil money again.
8914 2018-08-11 18:28:19 Despite sanctions Russias economy is growing. Initially sanctions worked, later on not at all. Russias economy is heavy connected to oil/gas prices. Check next year and youll see Russia pretty high up on that list.
8915 2018-08-11 18:28:15 Bone broth is VERY good for you and can be added to any concoction. TIP FROM THE TOP............Boron Supplementation, Magnesium, Iodine, Vit D, C, K2, Coconut OIl, Turmeric, Desiccated Liver. The land is depleted from intensive farming.
8916 2018-08-11 18:27:45 Even Apostle Paul told the Church leaders how they should properly judge sinning brethren. 
Do the churches practice this even?
James 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

8918 2018-08-11 18:27:36 I only have one car yes lol my mom has her own as well she just has mine while I’m at work lol she got my oil changed for me
8919 2018-08-11 18:27:28 I only came for an oil change, I do not care bout fixing nothing else today
8920 2018-08-11 18:27:27 Thos is total BS.  cars polite the air, planes pollute the air, chem trails pollute the air. Everything causes cancer, oil is spilled everywhere.   But pesticides that have been used forever are the issue?
8921 2018-08-11 18:27:27 I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but... most oil is made from decomposed plants, not dinosaurs :(
8922 2018-08-11 18:27:25 Can we also get maple syrup in the Keystone PL headed to West Texas instead of oil, too? We have wind energy out here, and tons of natural gas, but we got no maple syrup for our flapjacks.
8923 2018-08-11 18:27:17 i believe you. i don't see any oil dripping off that donut at all!
8924 2018-08-11 18:27:10 Palm oil is appearing in everything, even bread!
8925 2018-08-11 18:26:47 So Gov. @ricardorossello should have been undiplomatic from the start and just insulted Drumpf to no end, with a recovery crisis happening? Fine. Well, in that case, Jindal should have just insulted Obama over the Gulf Oil Spill, back in 2010.
8926 2018-08-11 18:26:45 Can you cook with Corrigan Oil?  Asking for a friend.
#AskMRN
8927 2018-08-11 18:26:40 Good day, I believe the reason a lot of folk from the north are scared of resource control by home oil states is the feeling that they will be cut off from some share of the revenue, how will this be addressed pls?
8928 2018-08-11 18:26:38 People expect health insurance to cover every little thing. Car insurance doesn't cover oil changes or tires. Homeowners policies don't pay for lawn maintenance or your utilities.
8929 2018-08-11 18:26:37 Probably used gasoline instead of olive oil on his pan too. Ass hole
8930 2018-08-11 18:26:27 I dunno. $5B isn't what it used to be
Cable, phone, electricity, oil, insurance, groceries, charity, mortgage, college, vacation
Before you know it, you're broke!
8931 2018-08-11 18:26:23 Oil is moving, some by pipe, some by rail.  More pipe to Eastern Canada makes sense.
8932 2018-08-11 18:26:21 When we have a CHRONIC liar and racist calling for peace and unity, it says how much he disrespects citizens and democracy. You are all so stupid that you will swallow any snake oil I happen to sell. You will go home and say what a great prez you have. Americans are not fooled.

8935 2018-08-11 18:26:12 I change the oil for my car. But for my wife’s car, I choose to take it in because it’s $5 more than if I do it and the dealer’s work-while-you-wait space is perfect for getting some extra writing done on the weekend. #DumbLifeHack
8936 2018-08-11 18:26:10 Baby oil and make up wipes
8937 2018-08-11 18:26:02 Of course....they're the "Beverly hillbillies" of the Middle East, and UAE, all about oil, corruption, money laundering.
8938 2018-08-11 18:25:55 Why did she wear that Enbridge apron then? ...Why did she decide to work for the earth-destroying oil industry?
8939 2018-08-11 18:25:52 This had always been a peaceful protest no matter how much KM has spread rumour. It’s only illegal coz oil money influence courts to set injunctions. Anyways if folk cannot see the consequences of tying us to decades more of fossil fuel ...

8943 2018-08-11 18:24:57 @MorrisonsNews thank you to the managager of the petrol station at Morrisons Oswestry he was most helpful and very kind helping me put oil in the car
8944 2018-08-11 18:24:34 Gandusha (oil pulling without swishing) with sesame oil, once a day after brushing teeth and tongue cleaning, everyday will give lustorous lips and also helps in pacifying bleeding gums.

8946 2018-08-11 18:24:20 The plural of anecdote is crap, not data, but my 88 year old Southern Baptist Grandma is about to start evangelizing for CBD Oil bc it has replaced her pain killers.

8949 2018-08-11 18:24:04 Lets pretend the guyz who hve yhe 15 billion missing gives it back. Hw many companies that hv closed will open. The so called sanctions do not restrict us to manufacture cooking oil and sell to zambia. Lets deal with our greediness 1st.
8950 2018-08-11 18:24:03 - Cleanse: Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser with a konjac sponge whenever I shower.
- Remove oil/makeup (if I'm wearing any): Bioderma Micellar Water and a cotton pad. I do this when I wake up and before I go to bed.
- Moisturize: Embryolisse Lait-Creme 2x/day.
8951 2018-08-11 18:24:01 Come on Stephen you're smart enough to see through this snake oil salesman.
8952 2018-08-11 18:23:57 I have to be out of this dealership by 3 but at this rate it might not happen  really wish i could change my oil at home
8953 2018-08-11 18:23:44 Fish oil burps honestly might be the worst thing I’ve ever experienced
8954 2018-08-11 18:23:41 Black, Hispanic and female unemployment at/ near record lows. Manufacturing jobs roaring back. The European Union blinking on tariffs. NAFTA renegotiation completed perhaps by Labor Day. Energy production booming, with the US set to become a net oil and gas exporter within 4 yrs.
8955 2018-08-11 18:23:28 If you’ve been exposed to poison ivy on a hike or weeding the garden, wash with Fels-Naphtha within an hour or two. It works wonders at breaking up the plant oil that leads to itchiness.
8956 2018-08-11 18:23:19 I think PDVSA has lost control of the oil business, lack of investment, poor management, corruption. Lenders of CITGO should be evaluating to trigger an early repayment of the debt due to the legal action of Cristallex.Since there is no money, execute the garanty and take control
8957 2018-08-11 18:23:04 Maybe in a rare moment of self-reflection the US realized that it may seem a tad ironic if not hypocritical to side with Canada to take the high moral ground on human rights? Nah. Likely the obvious - Saudi oil Trumps all
8958 2018-08-11 18:22:17 Did your waffle with olive oil not satisfy you?
8959 2018-08-11 18:22:15 Sex is cool but have you ever used one of those face wipes and seen all the dirt and oil come off
8960 2018-08-11 18:22:07 I'm happy with Venezuelan oil. Nigerian.
8961 2018-08-11 18:21:56 Strangest sight today, I was sitting next to a guy who was applying beard oil at half-time. He said he hung about in shoreditch lots. Been told he is the London baggies chairman, shameful
8962 2018-08-11 18:21:54 We used to use empty hydraulic oil barrels donated by Bing the wagon driver who lived just up the road 
8963 2018-08-11 18:21:27 When your husband dons an essential oil that reminds you of the Imagination song and ride from Disney World.  Ahhh child hood.
8964 2018-08-11 18:21:00 the world is progressing, more countries are developing alternative fuel/power sources, it might take a while, but the reign of the oil magnates will come to an end, with luck so will their hold on other countries
8965 2018-08-11 18:20:56 Yes always  salmon in the oven 30 mins little bit salt n pepper drizzled in olive oil  mmmmm
8966 2018-08-11 18:20:24 Skincare people made a visit to the hotel today to give 'advice' and sell their products. Not content with having a stall they came round all the sunbeds. As they approached me I sprayed myself with my factor 8 oil and put my headphones on. Piss off, I'm on holiday
8967 2018-08-11 18:20:17 which node even is the oil node
8968 2018-08-11 18:20:04 That's necessary(port).On pipelines,we haven't ensured the fair treatment of oil prod. communities,they don't feel like joint owners of the infrastructure(pipelines, wells, etc),we haven't done enough to engage youths within these communities either. 1/

8970 2018-08-11 18:19:38 Overheard one sided phone convo while waiting on my oil change: 
‘On behalf of who?!’ 
‘Oh okay’
‘Yeah, you’re talking to her’
‘KFC’ 
*long pause* 
‘Oh DEAR GOD really?!?’
‘Nope, I’ve never had insurance ever’ 
‘I live in Marion. M A R I O N...I think’

8976 2018-08-11 18:18:33 My question as well. I am only aware of the Irving plant (Capacity wise) and I suspect the oil from SA is a different grade/quality than what would be piped from Alberta. The Energy East pipeline was for export purposes.
8977 2018-08-11 18:18:31 Lucius Oil Stadium has used more each year for marching events than for football... just sayin

8984 2018-08-11 18:17:10 Of course it is impossible to know the exact weather years from now - only the trends. Burning oil into the atmosphere isn't just polluting our own bodies and cities (reason alone to shift away), it is acidifying oceans and, yes, heating the atmosphere with unknown consequences
8985 2018-08-11 18:17:07 Curious about hemp/CBD oil? We now have a way for you to test the product in the store! Come by and experience hemp before buying.

9014 2018-08-11 18:13:35 We focus WAY too much attention on the agency of others and neglect the agency that we have and do not put to use.

It’s the world’s best source of carotenoids; 48% mixed of carotenoids and all 8 types of Vitamin E. It protects against blindness (rev. Mac D) & cancer (ie lung). Consume MORE red palm oil.

9040 2018-08-11 18:10:11 Thank you Brian for bringing this point up. Politicians don't buy oil but they do set policy.  In 10 years CPC never managed to get any pipelines arrived to tidewater or assist the national needs for energy.  Is there a refinery out east that can refine the oil from AB oilsands?

9045 2018-08-11 18:09:49 $TSLA Shorts are mostly agents of Russia and the Oil industry.  They just spew Negative propaganda.  They are financed by Fossil fuel money.
9046 2018-08-11 18:09:45 I don’t think the question is relevant tbh. Canada has expressed these opinions about HR for some time, and will continue. There is minimal commerce between CA and SA, this stance plays well in SA and changes little. They still sell oil to CA
9047 2018-08-11 18:09:39 nice experience with safflower oil
9048 2018-08-11 18:09:36 Defense, meaning invading foreign countries, stealing their natural gas and oil to profit the rich, killing their innocent, propagandizing then as vile terrorists, murdering their leaders, destabilizing their economies, denouncing their religions, etc. It’s bloody insanity.

9055 2018-08-11 18:08:12 Set up an electric fence if you can. That’s what we use around ours. Works great. Works better than coke and fly oil.
9056 2018-08-11 18:08:00 If you ever find yourself covered in gloss, fearing you’re going to have paint splattered hands/arms/face/shoulders/legs (delete as appropriate) forever despite a bath AND a shower then fear not, baby oil is the answer. Wipes straight off 
9057 2018-08-11 18:07:55 何故かねれなくなった
9058 2018-08-11 18:07:50 The British who arm and supply the Saudis are just as much to blame for these child murders. Not that it will bother them when they go looking for Saudi oil.
9059 2018-08-11 18:07:43 @SafflowerL very good experience with safflower oil Thanks a lot to provide such a awesome product .

9063 2018-08-11 18:07:22 We don't control the oil. Grow up and use some "common sense" and figure out how global capitalism works.

9065 2018-08-11 18:07:12 It would make sense for me to go get my oil changed and car cleaned in Kenosha so then I can just go to the polo store buuuuttttt watch I do some whole other stuff
9066 2018-08-11 18:06:58 gatau gaada namanya(?) putih gitu kaya coconut oil yang solid(?)

9071 2018-08-11 18:06:06 Maybe because they take corporate (and now oil) money and rely on blue dog conservatives to take on other conservatives.

9078 2018-08-11 18:04:57 I had to leave my car for 2 hours to get an oil change at the dealer and I feel so heartbroken 
9079 2018-08-11 18:04:35 Also LOL at all the beard oil companies now vying for your love.
9080 2018-08-11 18:04:28 So I have 19,000 miles on my truck and I just noticed I needed a oil change at 12,000
9081 2018-08-11 18:04:18 InshaAllah
9082 2018-08-11 18:04:13 But no one will mention that strong oil cartel who for the sake of their business let our hard earned money go to waste. 
Babar Awan was equally involved in this act of crime and should be brought to justice if NAB really is non partial
9083 2018-08-11 18:04:10 A new promising project for the oil industry. Come and join in this project guys
9084 2018-08-11 18:03:52 What other oil? Olive? And where do you get the tea tree ting?
9085 2018-08-11 18:03:51 Oooooh. Let me know how that goes. Beard oil virgin here.
9086 2018-08-11 18:03:43 You're just trying to get a rise out of us, and some attention. Obviously it's Sean Connery.
9087 2018-08-11 18:03:40 What we will and have already started doing is lessening our dependency on oil as well as diversifying our economy. I’m sure you were too busy watching your hard earned money quickly become worthless but...

9089 2018-08-11 18:03:17 WM hid the McCrone report for decades. Not only that - they actively lied about the amount and value of oil/gas reserves and kept Scotland in the dark about her potential.

Is it so unreasonable to believe they are doing the exact same thing now?

“Too poor?”

Not even close.
9090 2018-08-11 18:03:16 i need two new tires, an oil change & an alignment. my car sucks so much
9091 2018-08-11 18:03:10 It be the craziest shit bro. I get blamed because you knocked the oil over & then it was my oil at that

9094 2018-08-11 18:02:25 My cousin worked for the bank that brokered the deal for nandipur plant from france. The Oil Cartel had paid huge sums of money to then law minister Babar Awan to stop its clearance from the port and it was let to rot for 3 years there and hence got stale.
9095 2018-08-11 18:02:22 Can someone get Kaycee a normal looking container to drink from? I’ve seen her drinking from a vegetable oil bottle and now it looks like she’s drinking from a peanut jar. #BB20

9098 2018-08-11 18:02:05 Capitalism absolutely has a death toll: child workers in mines; black lung & pollution; the homeless; wars in S. America, the ME, Africa and Asia whenever a country tries to kick out Western businessmen or nationalize oil profits; union organizers strung up from bridges and trees
9099 2018-08-11 18:01:32 What part do you agree with? She didn't address a single point of policy.

Did you even read Singh's statement or just the clickbait headline? He clearly advocated for increased refining of Canadian oil.
9100 2018-08-11 18:01:18 Me I don’t understand again ooo, is onions scares in Kogi? Why onions and oil with maggi cubes. Sad
9101 2018-08-11 18:01:15 The government of Slovenia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Stuart Townsend in a donegal tweed wig.
9102 2018-08-11 18:01:12 Art by Alison Johnson shares a few of her abstract oil paintings with us :)
9103 2018-08-11 18:01:06 I switch all the time but 2 long time faves are L’Occitane shower oil with almond and Neutrogena Rainbath.
9104 2018-08-11 18:01:03 SA is already backing down. They realized they need Canada to buy their oil. Hilarious. This is what happened to Sweden too. SA needs us. And now that they just bombed innocent children in Yemen they’re in more trouble. Trudeau did the right thing. We don’t cower to madmen.

9111 2018-08-11 17:59:50 My front camera is blurry and I don’t know if it’s the fact I haven’t got my glasses on or if there’s just loads of oil on the lens

9113 2018-08-11 17:59:35 What snake oil? Quote me. I use facts and research.

9115 2018-08-11 17:59:18 Castor oil will do miracles
9116 2018-08-11 17:59:10 Really? Because to me you all sound like the socialists talking about "our" oil and trying to command the market.
9117 2018-08-11 17:59:03 My Jar of Coconut Oil in the kitchen has just started to get a little cloudy, soon it will be solid again.

You know what that means.
Summer is Officially over in the UK

9119 2018-08-11 17:58:35 Yes that as well. On a different note @thedragonLML that whale oil that burns in the bowls in the hands of the mermaids while it is whale oil it is called train oil but the train is a corruption of the ditch word traan for tear. So those flames are burning tears
9120 2018-08-11 17:58:28 Turkey hasn't been a reliable alley for a long time
*Invasion of Cyprus 
*2008 Turkish incursion into northern Iraq
*Denying German politicians access to German forces who were stationed at a Turkish base
*Buying oil from Isis
*Attacking US backed kurdish rebels in Syria
9121 2018-08-11 17:58:21 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,

cooking a simple ham.
9122 2018-08-11 17:58:00 Super jealous! You got a wayyyy better cuticle oil than I did! Lol
9123 2018-08-11 17:57:56 With respect Jen, that did not answer my question.

We all know that we cannot move to a non-carbon economy in the short term.  We need oil to sustain ourselves.  The Q is where is it going to come from? Alberta/Sk, or overseas? Notley and Singh disagree.  Where do you stand?
9124 2018-08-11 17:57:53 Making Heirloom tomato salad w/ just sea salt & olive oil is on my constant snack rotation.
9125 2018-08-11 17:57:42 You said I wanted to say we dont get oil from the Middle East, when I never said that, I literally said we do get oil from there. I was saying that people like to say we invade the Middle East “for oil” when that just isn’t true.
9126 2018-08-11 17:57:41 Oil Change 
9127 2018-08-11 17:57:39 For oil n business... Pfft. Your a surface dwelling idiot. Look deeper, it's sad when any soldier dies but the wars are about control plain and simple.  I don't think anyone should die for that.  Let alone protectors of our freedoms. 
9128 2018-08-11 17:57:34 It is great to see my Country being reported for something besides oil or the current horrific crisis. Thank you @atlasobscura. No cinnamon on the recipe though.
9129 2018-08-11 17:57:32 "Wall St and big oil give to both sides"
They corrupt the system that way.
9130 2018-08-11 17:57:32 That synthetic oil
9131 2018-08-11 17:57:08 Most ordinary English folk actually dont care about what Scotland does.
Its the ukgov thats desperately trying to keep our oil revenues.
Thats the long and the short of it!
9132 2018-08-11 17:57:03 It's the theocratic oil company of Saudi Arabia. Why would anyone be shocked?
9133 2018-08-11 17:56:56 Skylar all washed up, gotta get her oil changed now.
9134 2018-08-11 17:56:53 ...surely if forces were intervening they would realise this.c)I think your own point in the article about  Brent oil price rise in Lira terms increasing being the main mechanism plays a larger explanation in the cause of all this.
9135 2018-08-11 17:56:46 shaving eeverything and putting oil and lotion on >>>
9136 2018-08-11 17:56:46 Don’t matter if you’re rich. No way to justify $135 for an oil change.
9137 2018-08-11 17:56:24 Researching this. The subsidy reference was solely for electric power generation. It literally omitted any/all incentives for oil and gas production. I’m for oil and gas, renewables, and Texas-made energy. Always have been for "All of the Above,” but this need clarification.

9143 2018-08-11 17:54:50 We still need gas & oil. Too much of our modern world requires it, especially in the North. I expect responsible stewardship & corporate responsibility as we transition to sustainable alternatives & solutions. I would like to know who, if anyone, is talking about that.
9144 2018-08-11 17:54:45 You aren’t talking to a CEO of anything.  Just a Canadian using common sense.  You should try it.  If you would rather support other countries that oppress people than your own country & fellow Canadians, what can I say?  We could easily replace our Saudi oil & create jobs.
9145 2018-08-11 17:54:42 This isn't about fighting Russian trolls, it's about fighting the online Left, like those who think taking oil money is a bad idea.

9148 2018-08-11 17:54:08 The rest of the civilized world needs to get behind Canada and support us in calling out the Saudis and their human rights atrocities. Even our long-time friend and ally Britain has chosen a spot securely on the fence on this issue. Screw the Saudis and theit shitty crude oil! 
9149 2018-08-11 17:54:04 No one can be brainless enough to deny climate change at this point. Deniers are bought and owned by corporations like big oil and cattle industry
9150 2018-08-11 17:54:03 @RaymondWarnerr Hi Raymond i watch your channel a lot I'm only 10 but i need a scooter because my old one broke only because it was a cheap Walmart scooter i don't care how u make it or anything like that the color options there are that i might like: Gold, Blue, or Oil slick
9151 2018-08-11 17:53:56 I have bio oil and mederma. Honestly being so pale has its benefits...most of them fade into nothingness eventually. I only had one or 2 that were bothering me but they have faded almost totally away since then
9152 2018-08-11 17:53:50 I think the rationale is “I’ve driven thousands of cars in my life, and every single one ran on motor oil”

It’s less a car contest and more of a “things related to driving” contest

9158 2018-08-11 17:52:55 Its in the middle east's best interest to disrupt Canadian oil and keep Canada reliant on theirs.

The Liberals and NDP (both socialist parties) are determined to undermine Canada's independence.
9159 2018-08-11 17:52:50 Yeah, I’m not dumb enough to fight the 1%’s oil wars for them. I’d rather vote them out of office and implement the social services all Americans deserve.
9160 2018-08-11 17:52:50 Cost me $99 when I had to get the oil changed over to synthetic, but dropped back to $40. Theres just certain shit I cant fathom spending over a certain amount for. Lol
9161 2018-08-11 17:52:40 When I ask for extra oil & vinegar on my sub, what I really mean is soak that bun it in please.
9162 2018-08-11 17:52:23 Wow, I didn't know I as talking to the CEO of an oil company. 

Or are you a socialist?

9165 2018-08-11 17:51:51 My bestie suffers from migraine, this is what she does: drink a lot of water, apply peppermint oil or drink peppermint tea. She always eats ginger if you feel nausea.
9166 2018-08-11 17:51:42 Who believes in CBD pen/oil?
9167 2018-08-11 17:51:39 I always oil up my meat 
9168 2018-08-11 17:51:30 I agree with you on war but I think we’re being fed more bullshit than what’s true, it’s stinks of Iraq all over again, the US have wanted into Iran for a long time and stating oppressive government feeds on people’s heart strings. If they had no oil no one would be interested

9178 2018-08-11 17:50:39 Just had pepperoni, spicy chicken, steak and jalapeno with garlic oil on tomato base with thin crust, you should make it a standard it's a winner
9179 2018-08-11 17:50:35 Canada has enough oil to run the country. Problem is it's controlled by multinational oil co's.
9180 2018-08-11 17:50:27 And I almost forgot you start with grapeseed oil then add the peanut butter and mix in the tomato paste and spices add the diced tomatoes at the end then water or broth
9181 2018-08-11 17:50:21 EU corrupted leaders support fascist Islamic Regime of Iran and have their own shares in shedding blood of Iranian citizens. The collapse of Islamic shameful regime is soon and we wont forget how European leaders violated our rights for money and oil.

9184 2018-08-11 17:49:46 Where were you when USA invation of Iraq, Libya, Syria which started a huge migration crisis in Europe?
Where were you when US created and armed ISIS? Arming Al Qaida in Syria but fighting them in Afghanistan. 

Just all these for oil and land grabbing for illegal military bases

9186 2018-08-11 17:49:23 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
9187 2018-08-11 17:49:19 Huh. Halloumi cheese just fries without oil or anything cos it's so fatty and takes up to a minute and tastes identical to nandos stuff. Good to know. Pain in the arse to cut though. Falls apart a bit...
9188 2018-08-11 17:49:18 But moreso the failure of leadership from the United States since the emergence of Trump. Maybe time for Canada to wield the big stick too. Has been on the receiving end from Saudi Arabia. Canada could cut off oil sales from SA spared by their irrational crown prince
9189 2018-08-11 17:49:18 
9190 2018-08-11 17:49:13 Coconut oil is the greatest thing ever lol
9191 2018-08-11 17:49:13 Changing your own oil is the cheapest option but the way they make new cars now, it's difficult to get to where the screws & oil can are
9192 2018-08-11 17:49:09 US doesn’t need KSA’s oil any longer and politically it would be hard to risk US soldiers lives for a nation whom many Trump supporters still associate with the 9/11 bombers.

9195 2018-08-11 17:48:57 The neo liberal wet dream destroying the livelihood of millions & wasting the oil revenue.
9196 2018-08-11 17:48:55 Which farm systems are we releasing today?  Or are you changing the oil on your bionic arms today?
9197 2018-08-11 17:48:54 I’m no vape god, but essential oil vapes are my new obsession.
9198 2018-08-11 17:48:33 Upon reflection, if the ref has made the correct call for the penalty, and mounie has scored his chance, and if we’d spent $70M+ on a keeper, and if Dean Hoyle had tax dodged and gone into corrupt Russian oil instead of birthday cards we would of nicked a draw. Maybe.
9199 2018-08-11 17:48:31 Yes!!! I’ve had ppd and anxiety bad since my daughter (she’s 18 mos now). I started cbd oil about a month ago and it’s changed my life! I can’t even explain to you how good I feel on it. I was freaking out on my kids all the time, I hated myself. I’ve only had one bad day since!
9200 2018-08-11 17:48:21 Sad you feel that way. The New European isn’t a newspaper, it’s a propaganda sheet. It’s contributors cannot be classified as journalists - they are snake oil salesmen - so please don’t be fooled by their bollocks, you’re better than that
9201 2018-08-11 17:48:18 He supplied arms to the Ukrainian, he’s trying to be a net energy exporter including oil a.k.a. Russia is only economic leg, he’s trying to get Germany to stop taking oil from Russia. He’s bombing Assad, his ally. If he’s a Russian puppet, he has to be the worst puppet ever.
9202 2018-08-11 17:48:17 Yes, oil profits were used to establish it, initially for indigenous residents. Later expanded because other demographics objected. But most states have foundering industry. Even oil $ is drying up as the environment is pushed to the breaking point. So how do you fund it?
9203 2018-08-11 17:48:12 Porsche couldn’t even give me a heads up like “Hey don’t eat this week your oil change is gonna be like $300” 
9204 2018-08-11 17:48:07 Hey Democrats.  Other than representing a porno queen against Trumpo, what had Avenatti done?  Is he another snake oil salesman
9205 2018-08-11 17:48:04 Yes “our” Canadian oil.  Which is currently handcuffed.  So we really only have one customer & have to sell it at reduced rates.  By getting more of “our” oil to market we help create a better life for “Canadians”.  If not “you” than people “you” know.
9206 2018-08-11 17:47:56 Is today Whitney Houston’s birthday? I got my oil changed and Honda had her station on. I’m at Starbucks and they have her station on too.
9207 2018-08-11 17:47:39 Crossing of wires at #Iran's NIOC.
Iran's oil ministry news service Shana today quoted NIOC investment chief Mostafavi as saying CNPC had taken Total's share in the South Pars phase 11 gas project, only for Mostafavi to issue a denial hours later, via Shana. #oott

9213 2018-08-11 17:46:55 I’m sure she is eternally grateful. WTF do you do with it? Oil your bike chain?
9214 2018-08-11 17:46:16 Unfortunately kids bodies are unlikely to make a difference.I think  Saudi oil fields will have to dry up first before they're removed from the UN human rights council.
9215 2018-08-11 17:46:10 Light sweet Crude oil is currently at a key level of resistance (price level....67.75). What you do at this key price level will say much about your skills....Be patient and learn to listen to the market...let the market tell you want to do.

9221 2018-08-11 17:45:43 i usually use a really low quality pencil brush(lol) and a oil textured brush! I'm lazy tho so i enable pressure colour duality to make mixing easier between colours
9222 2018-08-11 17:45:13 But you still prefer Saudi oil over Canadian oil.
9223 2018-08-11 17:45:08 Why not add a surcharge to American oil sold to China?  Surcharge to be used for infrastucture spending and energy independence.

9226 2018-08-11 17:44:39 make a mask using bentonite clay + activated charcoal. Add tea tree oil to the mask or apply after  cleansing. Be cautious cause tea tree oil can burn the skin.
9227 2018-08-11 17:44:36 or i might add some lemon juice, fresh oregano and thyme. if i am feeling like something a bit more flavorful, fry cumin seeds, crushed ginger and coriander seeds together, add some coconut milk (or coconut oil) and lemon juice. the sky's the limit with the bitter greens.
9228 2018-08-11 17:44:35 It’s the reason I’m basically drinking CBD oil.

9237 2018-08-11 17:42:55 No "we" can't because we don't control the oil produced here. That won't ever change. I really wish people would stop pretending they don't know how global capitalism works.
9238 2018-08-11 17:42:51 Saudi Arabia, The USA and Russia control the oil market. China has to have oil for there huge economy to grow.
9239 2018-08-11 17:42:31 LOL!! love short the oil...:) you should know that by now
9240 2018-08-11 17:42:11 When Citizen United is overturned, we can be all pure.  Wall St and big oil give to both sides, by the way.  They also hire people.  You know....jobs.
9241 2018-08-11 17:42:11 i'm blanching them, cutting them small and freezing. but i usually just fry up some onions and garlic (maybe some spices, depending on the flavor profile), and saute. sometimes, i'll add some fresh ginger, toss in a little soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice wine vinegar.
9242 2018-08-11 17:42:00 I see a boat, engine, clothes, life jackets, glasses, a sign, marker to write sign, I assume they have shoes, vehicles, phones, fuel, oil, safety gear, a pail or bailer, a razor to shave, they live in a structure, eat food & survived the winter.  All because of...............Oil.

9244 2018-08-11 17:41:49 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
9245 2018-08-11 17:41:46 The Independent is feeding into the denier meme that it is too late, at least with these kind of images (burning oil patch), and this headline. @MichaelEMann

9249 2018-08-11 17:41:29 The so-called liberal postwar order was deceit for land grabs by powerful nations. Nkrumah's assassination was assisted by Britain and the U.S.; oil and mineral greed by imperial powers wasn't going to be impeded.

9265 2018-08-11 17:39:36 The current politicians, auto industry and big oil do not want the general public to understand how easy it is to move to more efficient and sustainable energies.  You have no valid point.

9279 2018-08-11 17:37:49 @DrGundry Hi Dr. Gundry! I am not sure if you are receiving my tweets because I never receive any response?  I asked about coconut oil if I should buy refined or unrefined?  Do you have to use romain in 3 day cleanse shake?
9280 2018-08-11 17:37:49 Oil did not follow yet
9281 2018-08-11 17:37:38 US is now the largest producer of oil and an exporter. So your first point is not a point.

Secondly, the US is doing more and more solar. Don't understand why you think we aren't, unless you are just pretending not to know.

Wind kills millions of birds each year. Not the best.

9297 2018-08-11 17:35:58 I love how far #Cannabis has come over the years, but I have a funny feeling I'm going to be relegated to the 'old school' class on shit. I like seeing and smoking bud.... Like, picked off the plant, hung up to dry, trimmed and cured... no extra crystals over it, no extra oil
9298 2018-08-11 17:35:58 Yes. If only he could think of some reliable source of energy products produced ethically with the highest regard for environmental impacts on the planet which are available to Eastern Canadians without needing tankers or oil trains and creates wealth for Canadians. If only...
9299 2018-08-11 17:35:56 3) The occident can't anymore go out from the war of the middle East because now Occidental economy  is used to exploit the Middle East oil. If they stop to exploit it the economy collapses.
It is an irreversible process for us occidentals. 
Obama kept on this war for this reason

or
the person that accepts all the science but still wants to increase the oil sands anyway?
9302 2018-08-11 17:35:36 But @DNC is thinking about taking Oil Money again
9303 2018-08-11 17:35:15 @TomPerez The latest reversal on oil & gas donations is why progressives WILL ultimately get rid of both u AND Nancy. Two soft-spoken people who also do NOT carry big sticks. Precisely what this party does NOT need any more. We need fighters who will get RID of corporate BS. Bye

9312 2018-08-11 17:34:28 1) Occidental planes who kill innocent people. Occidentali soldiers who are the real terrorists in middle East.  The business men form occident who are stealing their oil for their interests. This is happening now.
9313 2018-08-11 17:34:19 Likewise, in oil form, and not recreational smoking.  Good game today, by the way, Duke...and good try too :-)

9321 2018-08-11 17:33:13 40% of our oil comes from right here in the states. The country who gives us the most oil: Canada. After them? Mexico. After that?  Saudi Arabia. Are those third world countries?
9322 2018-08-11 17:33:09 The war in Iraq was illegal as stated by John Chilcott and Kofi Annan and Milliband stopping the bombing of Syria that was just+correct. Syria was made a lot worse by the funding and arming of opposition groups such as Al Nusra. Syria was about oil pipelines not red lines.
9323 2018-08-11 17:33:07 You're talking to an anarcho-capitalist.

Capitalism moral - there's nothing more moral than voluntary exchange.

Socialism is parasitic - and it doesn't really help anyone. Just look at how Venezuela failed to adapt to falling oil prices. Too much welfare.

9331 2018-08-11 17:31:52 I'm fine with them buying foreign oil if they can come up with a way to tax other countries at an equivalent to what would be obtained from developing and processing oil in Canada for Canada.

9354 2018-08-11 17:29:10 A nuclear Iran is not good 4 America. I don’t necessarily think that the reason for these wars is over oil. I believe it’s over power.

9362 2018-08-11 17:28:17 Uhhhh, okay? That’s so frustrating, I’m sorry about that. There’s a strange ideological purity in thinking that China somehow doesn’t participate in realpolitik, as though they’re weren’t arming militia in Sudan in exchange for oil.

9464 2018-08-11 17:17:52 Actually, you have no idea what you’re saying. Yes we do get oil out of there, but everyone says “ooh the US invades the middle east for oil” when the America’s have oil. A lot of oil. I live in Louisiana. Oil is being drilled everywhere.

9470 2018-08-11 17:17:15 Mr. President, it is because of you that I am able to return to work in the Gulf of Mexico on offshore oil rigs! Have been out of work since 2015. Keep up the great work put money back in our pockets!
9471 2018-08-11 17:17:15 did you fold it and drain the oil first or go rogue?

9481 2018-08-11 17:16:03 Then just about all banks, oil companies and retail giants should be broken up.
9482 2018-08-11 17:15:55 Changed my oil myself yesterday.  Drove to the shop and everything
9483 2018-08-11 17:15:55 Man I dropped a lot of spoons today tidying my desk. My legs are just aching. I have lye and soap oils just sitting on the bench in the kitchen and honestly I think I might just add some mango fragrance oil and let it go to soap because I'm just
9484 2018-08-11 17:15:53 Wait until the oil runs out. Different hymn sheets will be issued.
9485 2018-08-11 17:15:51 Yeah, JPod has been slowly dying out, down from 200 to 75. In 2017, Sonic died from starvation, and now Scarlet dies a slow and painful death while they "monitor" her. NOAA accepts money from Sea World and Shell Oil. The pipeline is being built. Inhumane and cruel. #Breachthedam

9487 2018-08-11 17:15:26 My fragrance oil is so fiiine you need to diffuse me—can’t handle me all at once!
9488 2018-08-11 17:15:23 I think there will be some, but consider where oil was trading when the 2018 hedges were put on, versus where the new hedges are being put on today. Most that I’ve seen are hedging about 33-50% of production, and now are hedging 2019 above $60.
9489 2018-08-11 17:15:19 Their manuka honey and marfula oil soap was everything to me, and the olive and marula baby lotion honestly replaced my Palmer’s stretch mark formula. I can’t find the formulations I loved though.

9493 2018-08-11 17:14:55 Bought some rosemary oil. Let's hope its purification powers are all that because it smells nasty.
9494 2018-08-11 17:14:24 Actually we get our oil from the Middle East... whether it’s bargained or with force is another story.
9495 2018-08-11 17:14:23 The new oil...
Be carful we don't throw the baby out with the bath water 
No pun intended.
9496 2018-08-11 17:14:21 omggg nas!!! yes you can make them
if you do just make sure you put them in a plate/bowl with paper layered underneath it! a looot of oil. but also salt salt salt once theyre in the bowl (before they finish drying so it sticks) or they'll be very plain and oily-tasty
9497 2018-08-11 17:13:46 Bite the bullet. Get re elected. Oil to tidewater and stop Saudi Oil. Tough decisions but it's a tough job.

9500 2018-08-11 17:13:33 Cowardice from the American Government regarding the Candian-Saudi dispute. It would be a great time for our political allies in Europe to do or say something, anything. Then again oil reigns supreme over human rights in the eyes of Capitalism. What a shame...

9502 2018-08-11 17:12:51 YESSSSS! @JustinTrudeau please ensure we cut all ties to Saudi oil. Price is too high to import it - in terms of human rights.

9505 2018-08-11 17:11:40 @POTUS Mr. President fracking for oil is about as popular as hiring senior citizens out for prostitution. Fracking horribly pollutes drinking water and also encourages seismic movements & earthquakes. Grow an oil replacement crop, instead. Better off this way.Thank you

9521 2018-08-11 17:09:48 Who’s going to sell burgers if the workers quit? Labor creates revenue, regardless of what you say or post. Gasoline makes the engine run, plus it needs oil. Bullets need gun powder, computers need electricity. Revenue needs labor.
9522 2018-08-11 17:09:48 You indeed can! Brush a little olive oil over and crack some salt on before putting in the oven.

9532 2018-08-11 17:08:13 We need to change the focus from hate and violence, and start shutting down the oil production. Global warming is not a joke. Take a look at the cooling waters in the Atlantic and the constant warming trend of the earth. The weather patterns are changing drastically.

9547 2018-08-11 17:05:49 Agreed!!! Jojoba oil saves me and is pet safe - also this is exactly how I recommend stretching. Don’t use acrylic or silicone they’re hazardous. Don’t buy ANYTHING from China.

9551 2018-08-11 17:05:03 Thanks for confirming you were serious! After re-reading your nonsense I didn't think anyone could be naive enough to believe the NDP, some of whom have spent their adult lives protesting AB oil, would change their minds. And now linking the fires to climate change... Classic!

9608 2018-08-11 16:57:49 Give me Trini food every single time dawg. Grenadian food is *basically* that with the addition of oil down.
9609 2018-08-11 16:57:39 It won’t do energy supply industry any harm. I’m thinking purely in terms of oil & gas and security of supply post Brexit, so government will invest in North Sea and the engineering that keeps oil and gas flowing. Renewables likewise. Sure someone will correct me though
9610 2018-08-11 16:57:25 I voted for Bob Dole for goodness sake...but to the 'Trump Trainers' you either take the castor oil or you are a 'liberal'...no thats not the way it works.

9619 2018-08-11 16:55:54 On the other hand, coal and oil are as mature as it gets and get subsidies out of the wazoo, no?

The incentives in storage should be seen as government investment in climate action and grid stability.

9622 2018-08-11 16:55:48 That’s ironic to read— I live in Burbank, CA. Don’t remember this many mosquitos?! My husband, stepson and I each get minimum 2-3 bites a night inside. Started rubbing tea tree oil on me at night.
9623 2018-08-11 16:55:43 Based on the current climate, do you have any thoughts on what would be the upper limit of sustainable oil prices?

9625 2018-08-11 16:55:36 It’s a llechwan (Welsh bakestone) traditionally used for making Welsh cakes and pikelets (the sweet pancake bitten and used for the mouth). You lightly rub it spray with oil and it needs no grease trap.
9626 2018-08-11 16:55:24 @jrridinger any plans for a quality CBD oil? Lots and lots of requests for it. 
9627 2018-08-11 16:55:05 the fact that i’ll never be able to get oil and water to completely mix makes my blood boil
9628 2018-08-11 16:54:59 If you have true empathy you would not support free government money which isn't free of course.  Just have a look at Venezuela nearly all people are on welfare and all of the country is filled with violence and poverty as they sit on the worlds 3rd largest oil reserve.

9630 2018-08-11 16:54:43 i had a whole breakdown over being out of lavender oil earlier but i just found a bottle in my makeup drawer,,, maybe the universe doesn’t hate me entirely
9631 2018-08-11 16:54:39 A lot of pure CBD oil doesn't have anything in it that's bad for dogs. Sometimes it's just for marketing. Hannahs spot has it too and you don't need a card
9632 2018-08-11 16:54:38 Also, please make big oil pay taxes. They use our infrastructure and they barely .

9637 2018-08-11 16:54:07 Positive for the union, does employment count, does being in the 5th biggest economy count, does mitigation of the impact of the severe drop in oil prices count, does free trade for 61% of our trade count?

9639 2018-08-11 16:52:54 But their IQ is just as low and Donnie's. You have to think when the dems are in office they push education when the repukes are in office they push big oil, tax cuts and no education unless your rich. Are they afraid people will be smarter and take over.
9640 2018-08-11 16:52:38 So still GOAT, scoring at levels never seen before, & only a couple since, on team with relatively low talent, elevating 70-80 pt guy to 150, carrying bad team to final yrs later.  So diminished that Oil as a team won trade, or at least came even, from on ice point of view. Goof.

9642 2018-08-11 16:52:11 @ShipleyDo_Nuts is the King of all donuts, but they could use a hot & fresh sign.

Lighter & less sweet than @krispykreme .

Offer more variety too, but the plain glazed, when hot out of the oil & freshly glazed, award winning, in the opinion of the afficianado.


9643 2018-08-11 16:51:58 Agreed. Canada isn’t immune to this sort of conundrum, Germany has had similar headaches, and are notably silent on this at the moment. Seems like the West is just that desperate for Saudi blood money/oil.
9644 2018-08-11 16:51:43 Neither does oil, because the Internal Combustion Engine is dead. China is going electric, Europe is too and hell has frozen over, because Saudi Arabia is going full solar and just invested in Tesla. Battery efficiency is up & cost plummeting. Thus oil is dead too.
9645 2018-08-11 16:51:40 While I fancy myself as a DIYer,  I just walked into Home Depot and a woman in an orange apron asked me if I was interested in air conditioner I responded”I’m all good now that I do a weekly coconut oil treatment” #grayhairdontcare

9660 2018-08-11 16:49:44 Oil question re: Saudi Arabia/Canada spat...

If Canada were to cut imports with the Kingdom and ramp up domestic production of oil.

KSA basically controls barrel prices globally. So they could drop it to less than  barrel production price, stunting investment funds no?
9661 2018-08-11 16:49:44 waduuuh aku kurang tauu, cobaa dicek aja ignya @/puriverabotanicals tiap jenis oil ada penjelasannya kokkk!

9664 2018-08-11 16:49:21 US oil dependency from the middle east is real via statistics.  Math and economics are not your strong point.

Again, when western MSM and Russian media agrees with Saudi threat, your argument is weaker. I wouldn't post RT links.

9669 2018-08-11 16:48:46 Dear Canada, The UK's failure to support you is not unsurprising as it cosies up to a brutal regime so that it can sell its weapon/bombs to kill innocent children all in the name of OIL. Never trust the UK.

9747 2018-08-11 16:37:34 I used a stretching kit to go to an inch.
Bio oil is also really good to use for your lobes and as lubricant to stretch.

9880 2018-08-11 16:22:16 Yes, I'd like to see a change. But it won't happen at this point and when it does the shift will be seismic (we don't need you oil, so what is you have that we want?)
9881 2018-08-11 16:22:15 I do t have time to change my own oil today.. so I took it to jiffy lube
9882 2018-08-11 16:22:14 grilled romaine lettuce(brushed w/ 2 tbsp olive oil + 1 tbsp red wine vinegar before grilling) is the best side dish nobody ever told u about.

9884 2018-08-11 16:21:33 Bullshit. It's about oil when US was dependant on middle east oil which is  before US shale oil revolution.

9886 2018-08-11 16:21:32 Nobody cares about the Unity of this country after oil , Nigeria remains a geographical express for companies like chevron and shell  petroleum. ...
9887 2018-08-11 16:21:20 I know high end cars gotta have that synthetic oil which is $10/quart right now.
9888 2018-08-11 16:21:11 You Just Invited Kavanaugh in w a welcome! Hes an arm of Koch, and oil $ you are bending over for. What about demanding change does the DNC not get? Climate change will kill us all. Fk the jobs of career pols. We are TRYING not to be divided! What are you, Russia? Exxon? Foolish!
9889 2018-08-11 16:21:03 @realDonaldTrump Your government must try to enforce all sanctions without any exemptions, this is the law of sanctions. For us, a full boycott of oil is more important than anything else.
9890 2018-08-11 16:20:52 @MichaelAvenatti you're what my Dad called a greasy snake oil salesman; cheap, unethical, dishonest of "character", if one can even say you possess any. You should be disbarred for your unethical behavior. Prof. @AlanDersh has more class honesty & ethics than you'll ever have

9898 2018-08-11 16:19:46 so...unrelated to your post. I had an appointment for an oil change at 10AM, its now 12:18 PM. Still sitting here, this is 100 percent a waste of my time. Not thrilled
9899 2018-08-11 16:19:43 OK cool I've been on the Blackseed oil for a week now going to see how it goes
9900 2018-08-11 16:19:40 I wanna be done with Trump tweets. He will lie and attack to protect himself. Absolute garbage used to gaslight media while feeding his cult. A snake oil salesman who won't go away.

9902 2018-08-11 16:19:30 The resource curse. For a while only the nations with resources were ruled by dictatorships because the corporations and military didn't need to tax labor to have authority, having to tax labor means you have to ask permission for stuff.  Finding endless oceans of oil
9903 2018-08-11 16:19:27 Because your oil and gas industry pays really good money for highly skilled engineers

9908 2018-08-11 16:18:54 I have a love hate with oil/gas prices right now. Great for my #Midland clients, but it’s a bane for me driving an hour to and from the lake as well as filling up a boat. #firstworldproblems
9909 2018-08-11 16:18:47 do you think someone would complain about the fact that you aren't selling pepper oil in big enough containers then

just like that
9925 2018-08-11 16:17:28 Was expecting to see a tin cup 12 on the 17th. Seeing it is the Ellie Mae Classic maybe he got a par because Jethro got in the way digging for oil.

Yellow mustard 
Salt
White pepper. 

That's it.

9930 2018-08-11 16:16:57 the silicon valley eats up anything and everything like seriously if i really wanted a piece of this i would sell pepper oil shots and then move out of state with the several hundred thousand i’d made off of selling pepper oil
9931 2018-08-11 16:16:34 Send in the army like y’all did for the oil companies
9932 2018-08-11 16:16:32 This is why many should learn to change the oil in their cars/trucks themselves. I put synthetic in my Ford truck for less than $80.
9933 2018-08-11 16:16:15 Space force would have a world class oil drilling team on retainer

Mix the yolk of an egg with a case of olive oil and a case of honey until you get a uniform mixture and leave for at least 20mins.
This mask nourishes, moisturizes, softens and restores radiance.

It's disturbing... although I don't recall anyone ever turning down equalization payments from Alta. ($200B to Que. alone)
Big business seems to have a strangle hold on our taxes...

9947 2018-08-11 16:14:43 Obviously, FanRag didn't have the star power nor the capital The Athletic has, but there are parallels in the rapidity of attempted growth and the speed at which it can come apart.
9948 2018-08-11 16:14:31 Tom, y'all might live in a world where those jobs are theoretical, but here in Texas, the birthplace of the oil industry, there is a lot more work in wind power than the oilfield.  We got lots of sun and lots of marginal land flat enough for solar, and lots of guys to build it.
9949 2018-08-11 16:14:21 maybe I should get the fuck up and go get this oil change like I set the reminder for ...to make sure I go

9955 2018-08-11 16:13:37 @VP Some people can not even deal with Iran, even with the national currency, they can not trade with Iran without any currency, otherwise the deal with the United States will be stopped. All sanctions, especially the sanctions on oil, are exempted

9959 2018-08-11 16:13:09 Hey hon, sorry I took so long.

That piece of knowledge that anything can still go up, and anything can still go down.  Crude Oil (CL) below $30!
9963 2018-08-11 16:12:45 Maybe you should read the label better. This product is called CB2.  It has both Avocado Oil and CBD Oil. Plus Humulus (Hops extract). & Peppermint. There are health benefits of all the ingredients. (Read up on Avocado oil.)  It is a really great product. Thank you!

10002 2018-08-11 16:08:27 Well you know where we live. And we have wool dryer balls that you can infuse with lavender oil. It almost works to make your clothes smell nicer.
10003 2018-08-11 16:08:25 A lot lower then the carbon foot print of fossil fuels. Especially if you include the drilling for oil, pumping it, transport, refinement process, storage, transport, actual burning in a car. Next myth please.

10019 2018-08-11 16:06:08 Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, but socialism and the left have turned their wealth into poverty. Leftists destroy everything they come in contact with.

10029 2018-08-11 16:05:22 I've always been confused by Christians willing to kill, especially over property. I get being in immediate physical danger since we are human & react, but willing to kill another human being over a car or oil? I've never understood where in Jesus words or actions they get that.
10030 2018-08-11 16:05:01 why does looking at animals covered in oil make me sad, but looking at animals covered in oil and deep-fried make me hungry?

10032 2018-08-11 16:04:59 Drinking Partners, 
This was a jab at @NPR not at the brew fest. Didn't even dig in to your story first TBH. I hope you have a blast at the fest today.

10036 2018-08-11 16:04:40 Tai Lopez is the biggest scam artist on the planet. This guy’s a seller of snake oil. Manipulates the feeble minded with promises of riches. He was even selling bitcoin investment advice for awhile. He’s a walking infomercial.
10037 2018-08-11 16:04:36 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

10043 2018-08-11 16:03:58 Get an essential oil diffuser for your bedroom. It’s heaven, a very slight noise as such but perfect for sleeping. Also the oils are good for you.
