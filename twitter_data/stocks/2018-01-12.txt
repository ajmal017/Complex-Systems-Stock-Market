3 2018-01-14 23:56:16 Interesting. If there are multiple offer nodes, doesn’t it make for an arbitrage opportunity on price discrepancies between them? If you can gain faster access to the consolidated order book (equivalent of SIP in stocks) than some of the nodes?

6 2018-01-14 23:53:01 You’d better sell off whatever stocks you still have while the market’s still good.

11 2018-01-14 23:49:14 There are many i think should be considered: license and registrations, liability insurance, ban on bump stocks, limits on firearms or capability to fire rounds.  There are options, not saying these are the answers but we have NO meaningful common sense discussions.

16 2018-01-14 23:46:03 Let me ask you this if you’re a savvy investor, if you invested your money in a high yielding stocks, do you expect a huge return in a year?
17 2018-01-14 23:42:33 Matt, I don’t know much about crypto but I do know something about HFT trading in stocks; 3 seconds is a LONG time in HFT, in which it appears to me the Ripple matching engine can be taken for a ride with market makers/trader cancelling their orders to make a higher spread?

40 2018-01-14 23:37:05 Honorable has a new definition. So #ChucktheSchmuck, how "honorable" is it when a Senator uses his unique position of public trust, to buy and sell not-to-big-to-fail bank stocks during the banking crisis? Documented in the book #ThrowThemAllOut!
41 2018-01-14 23:35:20 All we need to know, we know: he had access to a lot of big powerful guns and also was able to get the bump stocks. All the rest is details. If he couldn’t get that stuff, it wouldn’t have happened.
42 2018-01-14 23:33:00 Taxes down, unemployment down, property values up, stocks up, WTF are you whining about now snowflake?
43 2018-01-14 23:31:31 He will do what’s best for stocks
44 2018-01-14 23:31:13 . Shorting???  Meaning investing on the premise that stocks will go down?  Brilliant!  :)
45 2018-01-14 23:31:07 Stock market is part of the economy. Over 50% of Americans invest in stocks.

47 2018-01-14 23:28:32 I'm having a difficult time reconciling the idea of 4% GDP and a 30yr bond market that yields 2.88%

Central banks have to be behind the firm bond bid...

50 2018-01-14 23:27:13 We prefer debt free stocks to invest, so should be in real life too
51 2018-01-14 23:27:00 Even more importantly, the stock market isn't the economy. Nice that you and I have stocks (I am HEAVY Apple) but that jobs and wages are more important.
52 2018-01-14 23:25:02 Mostly everything he says from now as it was from the beginning has been a lot of #malarkey 
He'll just continue spinning stories. I've never watched the news as much since he announced his candidacy. Popcorn stocks have risen too.
53 2018-01-14 23:24:27 Well. ... I guess they regret selling those stocks.... sour grapes.
54 2018-01-14 23:22:58 Last year the jaguars were one of the laughing stocks of the NFL. now they are going to play in the championship game. That's a team I can root for.
55 2018-01-14 23:21:31 Der pre Trump. u should start thinking about giving n. what are u going 2 do n the next few weeks when more news about Junior, San Diego's earthquakes, n your private stocks n assets rapid decline come out. U already see that your personal staff is wanting 2 turn their backs on U
56 2018-01-14 23:20:27 I hammered myself with books and videos back in 06 / 07, trading (badly) stocks and options. Stopped 09 after they banned shorting banks the day after I opened a short position...on a bank. It stays with you though when you've gone hard charting and trading for 18 months.
57 2018-01-14 23:19:04 Why do stocks like $PLCE scare me so badly? I just can't have confidence in stores that I've only seen in malls - am I overeating? #WallStreet
58 2018-01-14 23:18:54 Sorry....Trump has everything to do with it.  EN...stocks rose to an all time high and continue to do so.  What little bit of growth we experienced under BO was small potatoes.  Keep living in your little land of BO where good jobs decreased and part time low paid jobs increased.
59 2018-01-14 23:18:53 What's astonishing is that Congress has done nothing about Bump Stocks . . .
60 2018-01-14 23:16:38 You don't have understand the stockmarket to see the improved economy...  just look at the stack train numbers on the tracks.  Side note:  UNP stocks are a reflection of that... 
61 2018-01-14 23:15:06 131 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
62 2018-01-14 23:14:13 To your points I spoke to a young guy, likely 20, the other day he was a server at a restaurant. We got talking stocks, it was Wednesday. He said he had put 3k recently on MJ stocks and was hoping to travel with his GF to Australia. 
Bought high, likely sell low.
63 2018-01-14 23:13:44 Thanks to Pres. Obama. If you’re SMART, say you invested your money in a high yielding stocks, do you don’t expect a huge return in a year! Trump has only been in office for almost a year.
64 2018-01-14 23:12:50 Are there stories of this happening?   Literally everything was on fire last yr. S&P, intl stocks, small caps, public REITs. Crazy when 20% is overshadowed by crypto.
65 2018-01-14 23:11:36 A liberal I know is claiming that the 2017-18 economic upswing is still based on Obama policies, not Trump.  I pointed out that Obama has been out of office for a year now, but we had recent business-bolstering tax reforms.  Stocks did go up under Obama initially, but fell again.
66 2018-01-14 23:11:13 Had to unfollow that joker. Should be a mandatory retirement age for journalists before they become laughing stocks.

XLE is a great way to go (I own) But also looking 4 special #stocks TTI & EXXI fit the bill 3 #invest
71 2018-01-14 23:03:39 Not a big problem. We can park buses outside the Capitol to take all the GOP traitors and co-conspirators to prison at once.  At least Jeff Sessions will really be able to profit from his prison stocks then
72 2018-01-14 23:03:28 Taxes done, get my stocks vested in June 
73 2018-01-14 23:00:49 LOL. Wow, you're a special one huh?

Some semi-automatics should be reclassified as assault weapons and conversion devices such as bump stocks should be illegal.

76 2018-01-14 22:57:01 That’s glorious for the wealthy as they own 80% of the FUCKING STOCKS. Thanks for nothing. Retail is still terrible and ppl are NOT spending money you derelicts!
77 2018-01-14 22:56:22 I'm a shareholder, too.  Over 50% of Americans own stocks, so to suggest it does very little for the economy is foolish. People see their statements, they feel good, they spend more. They sell some of it, poor it back into the economy.  Several articles saying Apple $200B back

81 2018-01-14 22:55:01 Biggest stocks to watch for this year?
82 2018-01-14 22:53:59 Stocks. Vacations. Friends.
83 2018-01-14 22:52:31 The market was not "taking a dive." My guess is you never looked at a stock chart in your life. Reality does bite, cupcake. Maybe check with someone who actually trades stocks before parroting the GOP talking points.
84 2018-01-14 22:51:22 It seems that only Canadian Weed Stocks can beat the performance....
85 2018-01-14 22:51:17 @MadMoneyOnCNBC 
Thanks for all you great advice. 
I have been watching a stock the is OCT, but they expect to be approved for NYSE listing by end of month. 
Does this alone help a stocks value? 
Stock is lithium Americas LACDF
86 2018-01-14 22:50:37 If I could afford bank stocks, I would also have a villa in Italy! LOL! Shares in the companies I mentioned are still reasonable, but the growth [pardon the pun] has been quite something to watch.
87 2018-01-14 22:50:13 The market caps are an illusion. Penny stocks also go up in valuation irrationally it doesn't make them real. Have fun playing the game.
88 2018-01-14 22:49:56 Tbh, you can't really say "gg" to a game where someone loses all their stocks to SDs
89 2018-01-14 22:48:53 I want a couple friends to trade stocks with.
90 2018-01-14 22:47:44 @paddypower is it possible to place a bet with ye on the price certain stocks will hit??
91 2018-01-14 22:46:32 Well then you and @CNN should step up and unshackle yourselves from the Democratic Party that is controlling MSM, you. Start a mission for greatness by reporting truth about @POTUS:
Stocks up
Unemployment record low
Tax cuts already helping ppl
All Trump not Obama!
92 2018-01-14 22:45:36 Sheree: It wasn’t stocks that he went to jail for, it was securities.

93 2018-01-14 22:44:29 His net worth correlates to the worth of his companies stocks. If he sells those then the stocks drop because markets freak out. That doesn’t mean he has $100 billion in liquid currency.
94 2018-01-14 22:43:25 I trade all the time crypto and stocks.
95 2018-01-14 22:41:54 Its cuz when you were elected all stocks plummeted that why it’s such a big increase since you have been in office
96 2018-01-14 22:39:17 Which pot stocks gonna be big this week?

102 2018-01-14 22:34:15 USDA-FAS @USDAForeignAg; World ending #stocks for #soybeans are up slightly this month with gains in Brazil and the United States more than offsetting lower stocks in Argentina
103 2018-01-14 22:34:05 I’m sure they’ll all survive. No one is complaining about their money and stocks. Trump is a smart ass but he’s trying to make the better decisions for America. People either hate the agenda for what’s best for America regardless of his mouth or they prefer to just hate.

110 2018-01-14 22:30:00 S&P Futures have posted a net weekly gain of more than 1.5% for 2 weeks in a row for the first time in the 152 weeks since 13 February 2015. The sequence last extended to 3 weeks on 25 October 2002, 795 weeks ago #stocks
111 2018-01-14 22:27:28 These are already stocks that have had huge upswing in a short time.  Highly speculative at this point, not to be confused with bank stocks. #high

FTFT, LINU, NETE, GROW, TEUM
113 2018-01-14 22:26:31 Oh my... this would again cause a panic sell mode for those with weak hands due to uncertainties of xrp and the ripple labs. Just my opinion only. I hope they would stick to Crypto xrp not w the stocks ripple labs. :-(
114 2018-01-14 22:26:24 Well, I hear that's smart... break it up, make good investments, stocks, bonds, etc.
Lol
115 2018-01-14 22:26:13 It's all related to value of outrage. Abbott bashing stocks have lowered, Trump at all time high. I estimate a decline of the value of #MeToo Quite a lot of Women are selling that stock. Might spend an afternoon drawing up a full list. #outrageValue
116 2018-01-14 22:25:36 Bio moving up. Interesting 1/1/18 IBD Top 100 stocks of 2017 of top 15 biggest gains 9 were BIO. Interestingly IBB underperformed by 20 %. So action was not in big caps. IMHO.

121 2018-01-14 22:23:32 BMO and RBC will let you use most weed stocks as collateral for margin funds, at only 3.5% interest per year. On large portfolios Interactive Brokers is even better, can go as low as 1.67%. I wouldn't leverage penny stocks but it worked very well with weed stocks.
122 2018-01-14 22:23:24 Wishing you all the best for this! We are coming to Manchester in March, applications are still open for applicants aged 16-25. Open drama workshops begin from March 1st.

123 2018-01-14 22:22:52 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT 
The way President is leading we are headed for another stock market crash in about 3 - 5 Years. 
Save your money now and when the stock market crashes then all stocks will be lower than ever before. Last time it happened 100,000 millionaires were created

125 2018-01-14 22:20:46 Brian, unofficially you are betting $SPY. Most of your stocks are part of S&P100
126 2018-01-14 22:19:11 most wont let you use margin on penny stocks anyway
127 2018-01-14 22:17:12 Retail clients in Canada.  Clamouring to buy two areas:   CRYPTO and Pot stocks.  Crashed retail brokerages up here. 
Not what you see at market lows.
128 2018-01-14 22:16:49 That reminds me the stocks where ordinary folk used to pelt criminals with rotting food in the good old days. It would work equally well on today’s liberals methinks. 
129 2018-01-14 22:14:39 How to make money in stocks by William O’Neil is a foundational book for anyone who wants to achieve the American dream of financial independence in the stock market... obviously my opinion:)
130 2018-01-14 22:14:32 Better invest in #Stocks than in #Cryptocurrencies
131 2018-01-14 22:13:35 I can find 1100 people and 49 percent will believe in Big Foot too. All I know is when Obama was president my stocks sucked and under Trump they are up. That’s a  hole pole.

134 2018-01-14 22:10:00 The Dow has rallied for 15 of the last 18 weeks, adding a total of 4005 points (+18.4%), making this the biggest 18 week gain seen in the 426 weeks since 13 November 2009 #stocks

I actually laughed lol
141 2018-01-14 22:03:58 So my sister & mom canceled their BJs membership to go to Costco instead.

If you are making $ great, but there are lots of ways to do that.

This how the market works until people get hurt for buying too high.

145 2018-01-14 22:00:57 US economic growth is sluggish . Big names like Apple, Amazon and Facebook are powering much of the S&P index gains. That means many stocks are actually lower or treading water but the overall market performance is being carried by a few heavy hitters.

148 2018-01-14 21:57:14 I agree w/ @CoinerTilt market cap is almost 6bn, expectations really need to be tempered. Yes, anything can happen but we should keep in perspective, just because the company will be evaluated high doesn't mean the coin will. These aren't stocks, it's currency for the ecosystem.

150 2018-01-14 21:55:07 Acreage cut much less than expected combining with higher US wht stocks than expected. US wht use for feed dropped to a 7 yr low. The price fall has hopefully been overdone but it makes a decent recovery that much harder and slower.

152 2018-01-14 21:51:20 So during Obama's budget the stocks have hit record highs... let's say how the economy does under trumps budget
153 2018-01-14 21:51:13 Well, at small stocks, if you're getting to higher $$"s bitcoin could have financed higher transaction amounts easier, its easier to hold a lot of money in,  a lot of pills becomes scarier , but it's pretty easy too to be honest but not as easy
154 2018-01-14 21:51:01 THIS. Imagine Ally's Mario, but being able to take stocks at 45. That's crazy
155 2018-01-14 21:51:00 it probably has a lot to do with the pharmaceutical companies, stocks n shit. corrupt bastards.
156 2018-01-14 21:48:19 I don't think it would actually be possible for them to liquidate it all. They'd have to find a lot of people willing to buy a lot of stocks from them.
157 2018-01-14 21:48:08 1929 margin buying was a factor

Lending people money to speculate on stocks is not great underwriting

So in a way, yes for 1929

1999/2000 was an equity not credit standards issue, but ultimately was about what makes investment likely to cash flow in future

So, yes-ish 1999?

U feel strong enough to curse, but not enough to make valid reasons 4 your beliefs? This seems to be rampant among liberal, leftist, democrats. Hard to argue results!
178 2018-01-14 21:31:34 I don't like the Jags because they're in the Titans division but I'm happy for em. It's cool to historical laughing stocks silence the elites of the NFL world.

180 2018-01-14 21:29:25 Jaguars were one of the laughing stocks in the NFL for the past few years. Eventually their future looked good to be in the playoffs but man I would’ve laughed if you told me they’d be in the AFC Championship game before the beginning of the season. Kudos to them
181 2018-01-14 21:29:17 also, the word "stock" re: soup was a word I didn't learn until well after college. My father called all "stocks" "broth"

and so... I default to same. everything is broth.

speaking of which, the kitchen is communicating w/ me in #OlfactoryHues.

186 2018-01-14 21:26:03 Almost, but not quite. Real estate, stocks and assets are all based on utility- people need land to live, stocks are based in companies that supply needs. The question is, how many of these crypto currencies actually do something well enough to serve a real purpose. Most don’t.
187 2018-01-14 21:25:53 So which one would you say would be a good stock? And what do you think about cannabis stocks

197 2018-01-14 21:14:58 Typical liberal doesn’t want to actually have a conversation about different views. Immediately they go with cries of racism, identity politics, and of course there’s the personal attacks. If you can’t defend your opinions without cursing, you need to expand your vocabulary.

199 2018-01-14 21:11:58 Nothing about that is factual, only the opinion of a sycophant. Obama had constant growth, not decline. Regulation is necessary to prevent another recession like the one caused by predatory lenders. 93% of stocks are owned by 1% of the people. Stock market is NOT the economy.
200 2018-01-14 21:11:37 It takes many years to turn a Country’s economy in either direction, up or down. Trump hasn’t been in office long enough to have influenced it at all.

206 2018-01-14 21:08:37 Cryptocurrency is a speculative market, stocks are driven by the success rate of the company you invest in. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Saying anything else is just being ignorant.
207 2018-01-14 21:08:32 @TSPallocation enjoyed your article on crypto currency. I look at them as penny stocks which are a gamble nine times out of ten.  I think we are going to see a lot of people lose a lot of money sooner than later.

228 2018-01-14 20:53:07 When CNCB pros can't read a chart right but tweets it anyway...The third one is a higher high thus breaking the downward trend. If CNBC wants to report on crypto then it actually needs to learn the market, these aren't stocks, it's a new paradigm.

234 2018-01-14 20:45:41 Currently, the price-to-earnings ratio (PE ratio), which is the "real" value of stocks, is "lower" overall across stocks in the DJIA and S&P 500 than it was a year ago.  That means the current market is not over valued. It is grounded in fundamentals and should go much higher.
235 2018-01-14 20:44:30 Now, all they will need to is to build robots to buy stocks.  Before that can happen they'll have to give robots jobs so they have money to buy things like stocks...  Then liberal robots will sprout out of the woodwork like cockroaches and tax all their profits away.

242 2018-01-14 20:34:46 You still have a long way to go before you fill Obama's big shoes. According to financial research company Morningstar stocks under Obama more than tripled investors' money at 235%. Perspective: Europe + Japan did 96%.

Obama, btw, ranks 3rd among all presidents for market's AG.

251 2018-01-14 20:26:36 Yes, lots of things impacting it. Given that all asset classes are up now another question is if crypto will fare better or worse than stocks/bonds/properties in a wider crash. But I’m tempted to simply buy the market and let it sit :)

254 2018-01-14 20:24:03 Fact check: True. Look at the temporary hit stocks took when ABC falsely reported that candidate Trump conspired with Russia and it's rebound when it was proven untrue.
255 2018-01-14 20:22:03 there's no "smart" or "simple" value. There's ranges based on price/book or price/earnings or whatever.  And then, all stocks (value included) that have less profitability = lower returns than high profitability. So deep value excluding low profitability is best value definition.
256 2018-01-14 20:21:56 The question is the winners can win enough at this point that an index will pull through or if a new set of projects will come up after the crash. Sort of asking if oracle and amazon could pull through a portfolio in public stocks if bought in 1999
257 2018-01-14 20:20:23 My point is you can't measure the economy by the stock market.  Most people don't own stocks. The top 10% own 80% of stocks!
258 2018-01-14 20:19:17 Hope everyone dumps their stocks and goes to GAB. Fuck this Goolag.
259 2018-01-14 20:16:18 He hasn’t grown the economy. It’s still coasting on Obama’s policies. The plan that’s destroying ISIS is the same plan Obama used (75% of ISIS was destroyed under Obama), none of those jobs Trump promised have come back nor are they going to.  Stocks were growing last 8 yrs

261 2018-01-14 20:15:42 Looks at the regulations around buying stocks, to create public support that level of control in the crypto market the public must be burnt by a huge pump & dump. Currently the MSM is pumping altcoins.
262 2018-01-14 20:15:23 A candidate for the stocks more likely.
263 2018-01-14 20:15:22 Blockchain technology related stocks, ETFs: Rise and shine or crash and burn: the casino is open for business: if you cannot afford to lose it, stay away: GBTC, NVDA, IBM, AMD,  OSTK, RIOT, TEUM, LFIN, KODK, PYPL,XNET. CARE to complete, anybody?

Researching and selecting your own stocks is not necessary; for most people, it is not even advisable.

267 2018-01-14 20:12:27 The economical infrastructure for @NILabourRB is now in discussion, myself and @DanBlackwoodRBX will begin to arrange plans for the new manifesto.

When the time comes, vote for a better economy. Vote for better stocks. Vote for national financial strength. Vote Labour of NI!
268 2018-01-14 20:11:40 You brought up nationality. I saw both side in Charlotte acting badly. Neither side represents trump or my America. Minority unemployment lowest in history. Highest crime in democrat Run cities. America getting stronger economy, capitalism growing.
269 2018-01-14 20:11:08 My girlfriend @cryptolanie can buy and sell crypto the SAME WAY I can. Here we go with women are victims. That's pure bullshit. Women are NOT victims they have the same intelligence as men if not more. We are all equal no one is stopping anyone from buying crypto or stocks.
270 2018-01-14 20:10:51 Are you serious!? 64 Wal-Mart are closing

272 2018-01-14 20:09:44 If you love stocks it means you hate bonds Caleb, and vice versa.  Just speaking as someone who is a financial expert.

274 2018-01-14 20:08:54 My stocks are the high ever since my president in office love  him why don’t the fake news report his good
275 2018-01-14 20:08:32 Paul Ryan I bet your stocks are doing well too.  Twenty million.  I bet those would be the CEOs and management.  Oh, the stockholders like you and the rest of the republicans in office.
276 2018-01-14 20:07:26 I’m still skeptical about crypto but I just bought in on bitcoin and ethereum, as well as a variety of trad stocks
277 2018-01-14 20:07:01 Votes are not stocks and are not subject to similar rules. You didn't proved your point by comparing those.
278 2018-01-14 20:06:57 Grover, why are bump stocks still legal? Why were they ever legal? Do you want them to be illegal?

282 2018-01-14 20:03:27 Long weekend is good when you are on a trip but where to go when you have snow everywhere..Luv otc Love stocks..and of course luv twitter too.
283 2018-01-14 20:02:40 Yes investing more money in the company by laying off thousands of people. What companies are coming back? Why is trumps products made in china and not USA? And fyi stocks in 2009 was at 5000 and in 2017 when obama left office it was almost 19000 so Obama did nothing?
284 2018-01-14 20:01:44 BTW, that dynamic was the whole point of the QE programs. Force people spend on other things by making safe vehicle yields unattractive. That's how they wanted to create inflation, unfortunately they failed because people just bought stocks, not goods.
285 2018-01-14 20:01:00 Very exciting times ahead my friends, I cannot stress enough how important it is to snipe the most undervalued stocks and start position's in them early! This way with appropriate dd it's nearly impossible to lose When you figure out the top performers avg up & enjoy 
286 2018-01-14 20:00:11 Love it where did you find your stocks though I can never find the right images in need

288 2018-01-14 19:57:32 Exactly. And what is a reason the stocks are soaring right now? This may suck for trump lovers but its companies reinvesting in themselves to drive prices of shares up. But when it crashes it gonna crash hard
289 2018-01-14 19:55:09 Honestly. Especially in smash 4 with only 2 stocks. Imagine if she had rest set ups? Honestly broken
290 2018-01-14 19:52:50 He may be right but he also missed almost all internet stocks such as @Google @amazon crypto critics can’t seem to get past the over valuation that naturally come with a new asset class—just like internet stocks in ‘98—but that doesn’t mean the internet wasn’t revolutionary.
291 2018-01-14 19:52:32 Yep should see a bullish move in some oil stocks
292 2018-01-14 19:52:28 46% of America own ZERO STOCKS
80% of America own 8% of stocks

The top 20% own 92% of all stocks and the top 5% own Most of that.

The markets have been marching upward since the March '09 #HaynesBottom

Correlation DOES NOT imply Causality...dummies
293 2018-01-14 19:51:31 I think Pres Trump gets it: 2 million jobs, 3% GDP growth, $7 trillion increase in stocks, law enforcement, military, geopolitics, energy, borders, trade, terrorism, tax cuts, healthcare, SCOTUS, courts, etc... I think #FakeMedia has been called DISHONEST repeatedly. #MAGA
294 2018-01-14 19:51:20 I WAIT FOR THE TRADES TO COME TO ME. I DO NOT CHASE. REPEAT! DO NOT CHASE STOCKS. You’ll get burned badly.
295 2018-01-14 19:50:43 @jimcramer which one of the FAANG stocks is your favorite long term?
296 2018-01-14 19:50:03 TIP: I’ve had a lot of traders ask me about my $2500 Challenge. I don’t trade multiple stocks at once. 1 at a time is my strategy. See below
297 2018-01-14 19:46:12 Tax breaks, vets cared for, GDP 4%, stocks highest EVER, jobs, my 401K has doubled! You were saying?

Trump won’t be POTUS
Russia

The stocks will plummet
Will be impeached

Can’t pass legislation
He’s a Racist 
USA will be destroyed
HRC will be POTUS
Obama, HRC & Democrats still believe this & Fox is from a different planet #MAGA
301 2018-01-14 19:43:45 Plus this was all done by PRIVATE businesses not governments. The US uranium mines were privately owned, then bought by a CANADIAN company well BEFORE any Russian businessmen purchased stocks in that company. Not OUR uranium! Got it? We did not OWN THE MINES!
302 2018-01-14 19:43:11 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your depression

Theres some big money in New York and home of stocks so I don’t think they will but it’s just Bitconnects new Ico is not allowing in u.s the regular bit should still work. I’m gonna use Tor browser to log in if they shut us down in the United s. I think that would work
306 2018-01-14 19:40:47 Bring back the stocks
307 2018-01-14 19:40:18 Wonder if @OpenAllHoursUK Arkwright stocks soya milk
308 2018-01-14 19:38:44 I get what you are saying and many factors could play into that. I do not think with as rich as other ceos are that they are taking money for just one from a company that doesn’t even have stocks yet. I HAVE A THEORY
309 2018-01-14 19:37:52 Despite some negative headlines (NAFTA doubts, BOJ tapering anxiety, hawkish ECB minutes, worries around China’s Treasury holdings, and a firmer US CPI) stocks extended their YTD gains (the major US indices rose ~1.5%+ this week and are up 4%+ YTD).
310 2018-01-14 19:37:29 Heard she was cleaning her attic. She found these old dusty baseball cards from the 20s,  and some stupid looking papers that say apple stocks.. Like stocks are on paper smh. She's filling up the garbage cans for tomorrows pickup
311 2018-01-14 19:37:08 bro stocks are up because people are literally investing in America, people know that Trump is a good president. Every working man with a 401k a pension shit like that prospers from the stock market
312 2018-01-14 19:37:01 Integrity, kindness, and humanity ‘Trump’ a roaring stock market price from a good economy you inherited and that only benefits those who own stocks. It’s never just about the money.
313 2018-01-14 19:36:06 def gonna be the guy who stocks the vending machines in the stadium he gonna have buddy running out routes and 13 receptions for 176 yrds smb
314 2018-01-14 19:34:59 I love crypto but its good to spread things around. Stocks metals real estate etc. Just like we do with bitcoin and alts.  Spread out to limit risk.
315 2018-01-14 19:34:18 True - I am long on many stocks - only short on 2 subjects. $TSLA, and one more. Short is fun - particularly when it comes to such a hyped megalomanic stock and a crazy CEO. On the other hand: short is losing money all the time - until the moment of truth has arrived. Waiting...
316 2018-01-14 19:34:10 If you stop spending money frivolously you’d have more zeroes. That was the whole message. You don’t have to buy all the apple stocks at the same time. The 401K isn’t a lump sum investment. It’s discipline and thinking long term. More mentality than bank account figures.
317 2018-01-14 19:33:07 It's wonderful that all you rich asshat's are getting richer but most American's don't own stocks nor do the have a 401k so what does rich people getting richer do for the rest of us? Guess we are waiting on the scraps again?
318 2018-01-14 19:31:27 It's great that the DOW is up. Thank you Obama for 8 great years of stability. Do you own stocks, does you're family own them? I know I don't and neither does my family so it doesn't effect us. The majority of America doesn't own stocks.
319 2018-01-14 19:29:48 There is a difference to assets that bubble once ever and assets that continuously  bubble. 

Tulips in the former

Bitcoin, stocks, housing, etc in the later
320 2018-01-14 19:29:39 My brother goes to a $40K independent high school and his classmates are already investing in stocks and bitcoin... They’re freshmen. The rich only get richer.
321 2018-01-14 19:28:32 No one has a success rating of 100%.. and if you have traded in stocks.. 2-3 months is a decent hold period.. crypto moves faster than stocks certainly..but people expecting gains in days and weeks.. is rather far fetched..
322 2018-01-14 19:27:33 @POTUS tweets about stocks making the wealthy wealthier, limiting immigration to whiter people, Clinton's emails and The Russia probe.

Never once mentioning #MLK Sunday.
323 2018-01-14 19:24:38 REPUBLICANS HAVE TONS OF MONEY TIED INTO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. STOCKS,ect. DONT YOU NO BY NOW THERE NOT GONNA LET YOU F CK WITH THEIR $$$$$!!

325 2018-01-14 19:24:15 So that guy who used to work for you dumped over $24 million in stocks w/ insider info about that security flaw. Didn’t people used to go to jail for things like that?
326 2018-01-14 19:24:07 Actually, I will be to busy looking at my stocks and 401K climbing higher and higher than to come back to this pathetic tweet. The impeachment talking point is pathetic and getting old. Trump is your President and will be for the next 7 years. He is not going anywhere! #trump2020

331 2018-01-14 19:21:30 In my case, I'm not a stock market analyst, but I own a lot of stock. And I understand Trends and how economic realities impact stocks. But stock market is pretty much like betting on horses.

334 2018-01-14 19:16:04 $cmpco great buying opp here after ~80% retracement. simple thought: wealth transfer is going to millenials + millenials don't like stocks + millenials like cryptos + millenials go to college = @CampusCoinORG
335 2018-01-14 19:15:14 trading stocks is so incredibly addicting especially when your making a nice profit.
336 2018-01-14 19:15:10 Buying a new HP cartridge on Amazon is like buying stocks ... on Friday it was 13 Euro, yesterday 14, today 12 ... the last I bought was 11 ...
337 2018-01-14 19:15:08 The more people that buy stocks the higher the market will go. MAGA !!!
338 2018-01-14 19:14:31 It’s not based on a “limited number of stocks.”  It’s broad-based structural differences and vastly different management techniques.  You may not understand the nuances.
339 2018-01-14 19:14:27 I really do want to learn more about stocks so that I can start to invest in a few.
340 2018-01-14 19:13:53 This is exactly how the general public buys stocks. Until the exchange made Google "partial shares" people thought it was too expensive. Seems most don't understand market cap, still don't.
341 2018-01-14 19:13:04 Ban stocks in RCB

344 2018-01-14 19:09:38 I really hope there is no merger with cannimed. Their leadership is a joke. They post that aurora is capping their stocks but what do you think canimed is doing to .HIP? Many investors will be out 1000s of dollars if this transaction goes through. VOTE NO!!!!
345 2018-01-14 19:08:20 reminder to idiot Trumpsters:

only 50% of adult Americans are even in the stock market

of those in it, 80% of ALL stocks are owned by the richest 1% of Americans

so yay -- that 1% is winning
the other 99% continues to lose

348 2018-01-14 19:03:25 Just out of curiousity, I also believe masternodes will have huge future if they are quality projects. Do you think people will start to see masternodes as the new dividend stocks or like rental for a house orso?

351 2018-01-14 18:59:01 Kinda. He has the economy booming. Stocks are at an all time high. He has rough sides. But he does a lot of it just to piss with people.
352 2018-01-14 18:58:12 Less than half of americans have any investment at all in the stock market.  The vast majority of stocks are held by 20% of the people.
353 2018-01-14 18:57:59 @realDonaldTrump and his GOP's priorities are CLEAR; their ONLY legislation, #TaxCutsandJobsAct  helps 1/100 people. Their DONORS. Less than 50%+ of us even own stocks. And over 2 years of hearing HIS OWN words has convinced me that he's a racist. We can do better.

Also, Sears & Macys have closed in our town. Most employers only allow 30 hours so they don't have to provide health insurance or benefits. And we have more self checkouts than cashiers!

362 2018-01-14 18:48:50 Must be so terrible with tax cuts, low unemployment and a booming economy and stocks so sad for you...
363 2018-01-14 18:48:08 — @sophia199968 hunny why'd delete your brag post, we still wanna see the stocks that you showed us.
364 2018-01-14 18:47:40 No. They buy stocks because they believe the value will increase in the future. The % of companies that pay a dividend is small compared to those that do not.
365 2018-01-14 18:46:49 It won't surprise me to see the dip in all three stocks now . I hold both parties involved in suit and no Hip shares .  Really read all the news releases though . Lawsuit just another slow down tactic.
366 2018-01-14 18:46:46 Are you referring to only 20% of time have 80% positions? My question is more about $ in stocks/savings, vs $ in account for trading. I assume at some point it makes sense to grow the account for trading. Should that also be 20/80? 20% trade, 80% save. #2080rule.
367 2018-01-14 18:43:00 Small Martin, did you buy one of these from their website? Or is there somewhere in the UK that stocks them?
368 2018-01-14 18:42:31 Explain again how this helps the average American who doesn't own stocks.
369 2018-01-14 18:42:17 No fiduciary should accept investments in risky fossil fuel stocks. Fossil investments will eventually fall.  While speculators may risk timing market to get out in time, fiduciaries should not be playing timing games. Oil is for gamblers, not investors.
370 2018-01-14 18:40:46 Great news for the top ten percent who own roughly 70-80% of all stocks. It’s really helping the middle class and poor people though
371 2018-01-14 18:40:01 That cannot be true. My stocks are at an all time high, my 401k, husband’s businesses are doing  well with all the deregulations, consumer confidence index, gdp at 3.4%. Manufacturing jobs are back. Unemployment low.  Everything was bleak for us when Obama was president.

378 2018-01-14 18:36:26 Half of Americans have nothing in the stock market and the top 10% richest own 81% of all stocks. Why did almost all of the tax cut bill go to those who are already benefiting?

381 2018-01-14 18:35:20 New Look j’ai pas fait! Je suis allée à Val d’Europe donc du coup j’ai fait Primark, H&M, Bershka et tous les bons magasins mais j’ai rien trouvé! Après y’avait bcp de monde + je pense que les trucs biens sont partis assez vite et ils ont peut-être pas remis des stocks
382 2018-01-14 18:34:25 And steel stocks right at its heel
383 2018-01-14 18:34:16 Faux news state propaganda failed to mention that it benefits foreigners who own  about 39% of stocks. Also, the largest percentage are owned by the top 1%,  it increases the gap between the disappearing working, middle class and the rich and makes the poorer..poorer!
384 2018-01-14 18:33:45 is there any hope for pac
385 2018-01-14 18:33:27 Remember, Buffett started out buying highly speculative “cigar butt” stocks.  #cryptocurrencies
386 2018-01-14 18:33:16 I'm so glad the stock market is up. I love stocks. And bonds. Anybody who knows me can tell you that I'm always on my phone making deals. Selling and buying. I love stocks
387 2018-01-14 18:33:02 You know what?? We will start seeing more and more articles like this in all media including mainstream.. articles that do not dream of bubbles and do not compare apples with a newly discovered fruit.. ie stocks or FOREX with #crypto
388 2018-01-14 18:30:56 Accidentally touched the "stocks" app and opened it. I'll never make that mistake again.
389 2018-01-14 18:30:40 On peut y voir du jus d'orange et manger des quantités de bouffe de merde hallucinante, et cela avec pour seul limite les stocks de l'appart
390 2018-01-14 18:29:57 Yeah, stocks always go up until they don't.  I guess the royalist limey has never heard of hedge funds covering  their shorts before a bust.
391 2018-01-14 18:29:19 Youngest son leaving for college soon. Hanging with my buddy. Then we'll do some videos! Speed up that learning curve. #stocks #investing
392 2018-01-14 18:29:08 #FOREX #TRADING #TIPS n°57: Not all stocks are created equal. The most volatile the stock the smaller your size.
393 2018-01-14 18:28:32 That "value" can only be redeemed if those stocks are sold. What would happen if they all went up for sale today? I'll take a shot at answering that question: you'd find that those estimates of value are vastly inflated – almost like we're living in another economic bubble.
394 2018-01-14 18:28:32 27' die erste strafe der partie geht gegen den EHC. Maly bekommt 2 minuten wegen hohen stocks
395 2018-01-14 18:28:00 I guess I should talk to Etrade then about this because they let me trade OTC stocks all the time.
396 2018-01-14 18:26:35 Thank you, I like this I was pretty close looking for stocks with this criterials.
397 2018-01-14 18:26:35 Fiable et en poste avant l'affaire. L'entreprise passait des laits toxiques en petites quantités dans le process pour vider ces stocks.

399 2018-01-14 18:25:17 #Metal Stocks in focus as zinc closed on decade high, Aluminium rose 2% on friday...Chinese trade data was good so having impact..Global rally is intact..lets hope for a good week..
400 2018-01-14 18:23:59 I can’t wait to buy Bitcoin at 2000 USD. Reminds me of the internet/tech stocks in the late 90s. Overvalued, not fully developed, over estimated.
401 2018-01-14 18:22:05 TESLA STOCKS!!
402 2018-01-14 18:20:19 Yep my old HR manager dumped a lot of money into the company, doubling her  401k over a short time frame because the companies stocks were climbing.
403 2018-01-14 18:18:51 Love this!!!! It is SO ACCURATE! Our 401K & stocks are HAPPY HAPPY! That line after 2016 election date going to keep going up up up..... I can't wait til day Dow hits 30,000 my guess by mid summer!!!! I LOVE  MY @POTUS THANKS for making our lives BETTER every day 
404 2018-01-14 18:18:32 im not going but tell me in detail exactly how I'll drown. Down to how I lose the stocks.
405 2018-01-14 18:18:32 Coinbase is going to add another crypto.....But which one is it going to be? .        #crypto #coinbase #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #altcoins #BTC #ethereum #xrp #ripple #StellarLumens #Vergecurrency #money #stocks #ETH #Zcash #LTC #Binance #Bitstamp
406 2018-01-14 18:18:17 Of course some prices are insane, look for example to the price of Ethereum, 2 years ago the price was $ 0,90, look at the price today, ofcourse is that far to high. But remember, we still earn a lot of money with tulips, internet, houses and stocks.
407 2018-01-14 18:17:57 Bonsoir Nicolas, je ne suis pas au bureau actuellement mais je reviens vers vous dès demain. Mais rassurez vous, les stocks sont affichés en temps réel sur notre site.
Je reviens vers vous demain, passez une belle soirée.
408 2018-01-14 18:17:19 Hmmm if people can follow the banks and the market being a bubble then how is if fixed ? I agree it’s a bubble and everything that goes up must come down. I know that large investment companies have super trading computers that can trade stocks in fractions of a second
409 2018-01-14 18:17:12 Actually when Obama took office it went down. The economy tanked!  Remember?!  When Trump started to run for presidency and won the stocks started going way up.  A Democrat didn't win! We are movin on up!!!
410 2018-01-14 18:17:00 Bonuses then many job layoffs because of it. Could be why stocks are up !!!
411 2018-01-14 18:16:09 You just answered your own problem, do your research and analyze the stocks that are going to make you rich. When you become rich then you can pay someone else to keep making you rich. So buy stocks or start a company and grow it into a corporation that rich people can buy into.
412 2018-01-14 18:15:45 It must have been a drug induced sleep since the inept culprits who pressed the button are DEMOCRATS, SNAP OUT OF IT & stop blaming this president for everything that goes wrong!
Except your stocks bet you like that! 
413 2018-01-14 18:15:39 مثل الاختراق من تلفون ايفون 
414 2018-01-14 18:15:17 My stocks gained everything we lost in a few years after Bush. Just like Trump looks good now.  Hopefully it stays but remember it was good when Bush went into office and went to hell at the end.
415 2018-01-14 18:14:40 My taxes went up to 12%. So did my parents. None of us have stocks. My mom is on hospice on Medicare but has to go on Medicaid soon, because after a 2-year battle with cancer, they have NO MONEY LEFT. Now they have to worry about cuts to Medicare/caid. But enjoy your golf today!

419 2018-01-14 18:12:20 innovative and clever.
You mentioned speculation.. this is an inherent part of finance. The futures market is not speculative?  It is betting on thin air!! FOREX? The market moves on sentiment and speculation and only by fundamentals. Stocks? W Buffet says a word and the stock
420 2018-01-14 18:11:46 It is easier to buy stocks thanks to technology and stuff this push prices up on stock market but it is build on speculation not truth. Many tech companies don`t earn money but stocks are high based on ideas about future they could earn a lot in the future? Maybe not
421 2018-01-14 18:11:20 I’m from what was Latvia,so genocide thats real racism, did your feelings get hurt by words. Poor baby. Florida, trump fought for blacks and Jews against rich WASP. Honored by Mlk family, promotes on merit, mostly women to high positions. All this hate comes after he was elected
422 2018-01-14 18:10:36 I’ve always heard when cab drivers start talking about stocks it’s a bubble
423 2018-01-14 18:10:34 CPAs and tax lawyers working for UBER RICH are already hard at work  prioritizing stocks, bonds, realty options. Millionaires becoming  Billionaires - that is new GOP strategery!

425 2018-01-14 18:08:46 What stocks? I’d like to invest
426 2018-01-14 18:05:11 If you’re 18+ with a job and you don’t have stocks in 2018 or investing in something you’ll be stuck in your class. 
427 2018-01-14 18:04:54 People were burned in 2001 by high-flying dot-com stocks that imploded, they lost money when home values tumbled in the housing bust, and then saw their 401(k) plans go on the fritz in the financial crisis when stocks plummeted in 2008-09.
428 2018-01-14 18:04:47 @Roger721 @DonkeyKongTrader You need to stick to stocks if you think cryptos are chart based. In fact, send me your money and I’ll save you.
429 2018-01-14 18:04:31 كنت اسمع انه نسبه الغباء نوع ما مرتفعه لدى النظام عندهم ولكن الي نشوفه كلمت مرتفعه قليله عليهم 
430 2018-01-14 18:03:38 Tell that to my bank account. Hardly top of 10 or even top 40. I buy stocks - any American can. The more you know, the better off you will become. The more you hate, the less you will know.
431 2018-01-14 18:01:35 80% of stocks are owned by the 1%. Your deregulation of laws protecting the environment & ppl gave the ok for corporations to make more, ie the 1%. Analysts say the only ppl benefing is U & the Rich. Analysts more not normal grow.  All U touch is & do is a lying.
432 2018-01-14 18:01:32 Everyone should be looking VERY VERY closely at old dot com bubble stocks that survived... find the big ones, and find them at a good price.
433 2018-01-14 18:00:37 #Electric #Car #EV are #Wonderful But More Needs To Be Done With Work Commercial Vehicles #SchoolBuses #Trucks Etc That's where #Adomani Inc. #ADOM comes in with their #Impressive retro-fitted electric drivetrain after the holiday volitivity the stocks will surge
434 2018-01-14 17:59:57 People are too busy getting fed lies to educate themselves on what’s really happening in this country. If you didn’t know, we’re doing fine. Business is booming, houses are moving, stocks are up, jobs are up, and there is nothing wrong with what Trump is going. Have a good day :)
435 2018-01-14 17:59:40 Hubby pay check is higher this week b/c we dropped to a LOWER tax bracket. We made over 6G's since January 1 with new stocks we invested in(invested 5G in 13 days its worth 11G) Under Obummer we stayed stagnant or LOST $.... @POTUS fixed that for ALL AMERICANS
436 2018-01-14 17:59:06 Imagine a portfolio with 5 percent allocation to stocks uniformly in which two stocks gained 3-4X & with the remaining portfolio being a mistake or a no alpha over market
437 2018-01-14 17:58:43 2017 saw lowest job numbers in years and even at all time highs stocks are peaking. Compared to the last 8 years our economy is slowing. You should pull your head out of your ass and take a look around once in a while.
438 2018-01-14 17:58:42 Gonna try making my stocks in the @InstantPot today. Usually my beef bone stock takes about 24 hours, and the chicken stock about 6.
439 2018-01-14 17:58:13 The only place that stocks it here is Harvey Nics, and it’s always super busy! I got lucky by randomly dropping in late on a Sunday :)
440 2018-01-14 17:58:01 You must be unemployed. The economy is booming. Stocks are at record highs. Small businesses are optimistic. And you, are a Debbie Downer because Hillary lost.
441 2018-01-14 17:57:43 Those assets have(real estate, stocks etc) have an inherent value. Crypt occurrences are like other currencies, which are assets and are traded. However, those currencies are backed by a central bank who pay interest on bonds, not so with cryptocurrencies
442 2018-01-14 17:57:34 No they won't, omg, it's in the constitution! Plenty of dem sportsmen that shoot, and protect their home.  Total lies. Nothing wrong with owning a gun. Just shouldn't be able to go and buy one out of a trunk of a car from some stranger. Or buy bump stocks,
443 2018-01-14 17:56:42 Invest your money kids

             Put your money in stocks

                    Be smart
444 2018-01-14 17:56:07 City are the laughing stocks today, not us. Looool
445 2018-01-14 17:55:39 Tax cuts and layoffs mean more profits and higher stock value.  You created least jobs in 2017 in six years.  Stock values don't create jobs, they create wealth for shareholders.  Unemployed coal miners typically don't own stocks, but that doesn't fit the narrative. #FakePOTUS
446 2018-01-14 17:55:27 Yes. For now ;)

(In general, I see few reasons to sell stocks. I don’t buy many.)
447 2018-01-14 17:53:53 Wait, I get my stocks in march. I'm good!
448 2018-01-14 17:53:08 What economic decline? Stocks have been shooting up since shortly after 2008 and unemployment dropped down to about where it is now.
449 2018-01-14 17:51:31 Long term, there will be many more cryptocurrency issuances than there are equities in the stock market. #stocks #crytocurrency #stockmarket #blockchain
450 2018-01-14 17:50:34 If people wanted to watch Fox News propaganda, they'd tune in with you. No need to tweet out their BS.  Basic economics knows that stock market not indicator of economy, only value of stocks which brings profits to shareholders, not employees.  Tax cuts=more profits, not jobs.
451 2018-01-14 17:50:30 @spbrunner I read your tweet on RSI and it made me realized that I've been blindly buying dividend stocks without considering the payout ratio. I will need to do some re-allocation in the coming days. With that said, what are your thoughts on ENB?
452 2018-01-14 17:50:25 Stocks are NOT for the ultra rich!! They are for middle class Americans. Trying to save for our kids college, weddings and retirement!!  An increase in the stock market helps the middle class tremendously!! MAGA!
453 2018-01-14 17:50:21 Aw-w-w! Always wonder if I should keep stocks of ginger ale & chicken soup just in case. Rest and eat well so you get better.
454 2018-01-14 17:50:14 CPAs and tax lawyers working for UBER RICH are already hard at work prioritizing stocks, bonds, realty options. Millionaires becoming Billionaires - that is new GOP strategery!
455 2018-01-14 17:49:22 Only 90’s kids will remember bump-stocks.
456 2018-01-14 17:49:04 Isn't the relevant question just whom do you trust with you or your family's money? If option A is following 1000+ randomly recommended stocks and option B is Bronte I don't think there's too much to think about. Also just saw the HLF store in Bangkok and it's schmick-looking.
457 2018-01-14 17:47:34 As a verified expert in stocks, according to many great people, I agree that Penn state stock is undervalued because of fake news media like MSespn and pennFRAUD! @ClayTravis and @FBI need to investigate this unfair witch hunt, the worst of all time according to many
458 2018-01-14 17:47:16 GK Crypto 1000 at 1093 down 7% overnight. Selling across the board. #ETH holding up more than anything else. Up 9.3% YTD. The much safer SandP 500 is up 3% YTD with an amazing start to the year. (Stocks and crypto involve risk and are not right for all investors)
459 2018-01-14 17:44:59 i have been buying stocks of random companies on TD Ameritrade hoping one takes off like bitcoin and i become a millionaire
460 2018-01-14 17:44:47 I don't have a clue of stocks, but I guess it's not as fast and dynamic as crypto? Also btc are more useful. Buying stuff online and such.
461 2018-01-14 17:42:41 $DOW - buy all 30 stocks and keep it till December .. why try to pick one winner :) #Trading #keepgoingup
462 2018-01-14 17:42:12 10 trillion in cash in the usa i wonder where it all goes. stocks or cryptos
463 2018-01-14 17:41:40 STOCKS TO WATCH:

1. YKGI
2. CSCSTEL
3. MYCRON
4. MELEWAR

The local cold-rolled coil players will benefit if MITI help them by curbing the import of CRC into the country.

464 2018-01-14 17:39:15 Blame your friends for not giving you credit for explosive stock market rally, Middle Class Americans don’t even own stocks.  APOLOGIZE for your “ shithole” comment don’t change the shiny object to what you want
465 2018-01-14 17:39:12 This is in itself is a heinous conflict of interest after the reversal of Obama's end to DOJ reliance on for profit private prisons by Sessions. Stocks up.. you can't have for profit and reform at the same time. #greed
466 2018-01-14 17:39:03 Rob Carrick’s Two Minute Portfolio in weekend @globeandmail is a helpful primer for those wanting to start investing in stocks.
467 2018-01-14 17:37:19 Every person in political office has made unkept promises, misspoke, claimed results that were only distantly under their purview. The difference is with Trump, we have results. Koreas talking. ISIS dying. Stocks soaring. Taxes dropping. Companies hiring. Jerusalem capitalizing!
468 2018-01-14 17:36:55 Why the Branson pic though? If a train company stocks just 3 newspapers why on earth would one be the miserable lies of the Mail?
469 2018-01-14 17:36:53 Moving in perfect diagonal manner. No pattern, no indicators required. Each dip is bought for such stocks. 
470 2018-01-14 17:36:45 Yeah, there’s always the chance he wants to dump stocks to the general public, but I don’t know if the general public has enough money to buy stocks from him.   LOL
471 2018-01-14 17:36:33 Ripple price prediction for today? Bounce back or no?                                   #ripple #xrp #coinbase #Bitstamp #litecoin #BTC #ETH #crypto #ethereum #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #Binance #cryptotwitter #twitter #polls #money #investing #stocks
472 2018-01-14 17:36:14 The stock market is even stronger in other countries. It is because the global economy is strong. Stop taking credit for something you had virtually no impact on. The true measure of the market is the S&P or maybe even the Russell. DOW is only 30 stocks.
473 2018-01-14 17:35:16 They aren't illegal in many states

"Because bump-fire stocks don't alter the actual mechanics of the rifle, the ATF determined that semi-automatic rifles equipped with the stocks aren't considered fully automatic weapons and are therefore legal."
474 2018-01-14 17:33:54 Thought you were about to talk stocks Hector
475 2018-01-14 17:33:32 ah mais enft nn ils ont couper les stocks de partout pcq on peut pas commander à mon avis mdr
476 2018-01-14 17:33:06 Reminds me how hypocritical people are, friends religious mother & sister who our against legalizing drugs, turns out been investing in pot stocks for last few years. Now that’s a good Christian

480 2018-01-14 17:29:48 ALL SLIPPERS NOW £7.00
While stocks and sizes last!
481 2018-01-14 17:28:52 It's a tea stock right? How do other stocks in the sector look?
482 2018-01-14 17:27:43 I've been on stocks for almost 2 years till it really give me back my money with profit. If you believe the project and company, make a strategy of how not to loose more and how to average down your loss. 

Good Lucky!!! #HODLgang
483 2018-01-14 17:27:16 It’s my dream for managers to be allowed to move from style to style based on opportunity without being punished. Not factor timing per say, but simply buying stocks that were deemed most attractive without worrying they’ll be labeled “messy”.
484 2018-01-14 17:26:55 I’ve heard it and heard and it’s now starting to get annoying... Every liberal person out here needs to shut the hell up and let our President @realDonaldTrump do his job, he’s helping stocks, lowered unemployment, and made illegal immigration go down, God Bless America 
485 2018-01-14 17:26:13 دخلنا اليوم ديار، وين بيكون الهدف الغالي ؟
486 2018-01-14 17:25:49 Fake news.... Come to think of it,.. Highest stocks worth over 7 trillion $, lowest black unemployment rate in history,  history tax cuts, more jobs, you name them.. But with lowest approval ratings?.. Lol I think it's the other way round people
487 2018-01-14 17:25:41 You put stocks into a grocery company??
488 2018-01-14 17:23:20 Is it Monday yet?  Keep an eye on $aaz $icm $por this week if you’re into #lithium stocks, $lg $cann and $app for the #mj ones (might still be some pullback in the sector) and $sx if you’re into making money in general  let’s kill it for a 3rd week straight 
489 2018-01-14 17:23:08 Poor people don't have stocks.
490 2018-01-14 17:22:36 Don’t go on ranks. Simplicity. Every fund would perform and under perform someday. Right now looks like Quantum Tax Saving is good but otherwise even Axis Long term Equity is good. Currently the latter one will not do well as it holds quite overvalued stocks .
491 2018-01-14 17:21:07 Man shitty
492 2018-01-14 17:20:13 Well, by your forecast, oil & gold stocks shld be ok, & tech largely benefits from weak dollar. You like emerging markets but see rates rising significantly. EU stocks don't seem appealing per your thesis
493 2018-01-14 17:19:42 jimin bought all the stocks from the cutest grown man on earth company
494 2018-01-14 17:17:48 Bobby lad
495 2018-01-14 17:17:23 You clearly don't know how stocks work
496 2018-01-14 17:17:02 And each time I was probably screaming for ball, then was pissed  off until it inevitably ended up in  'brilliant stocks!'
497 2018-01-14 17:16:52 Dumbo Sanghoo, What are you upto? Dumping Malware stocks without any relevance whatsoever. Don’t tag me, not interested in the stupidity. 
498 2018-01-14 17:16:49 Open an account. Start an IRA, buy some stocks. You to can make money in the Markets. If YOU dont Invest in YOUR future who will?
499 2018-01-14 17:16:04 Any average Joe that has a 401k is invested in stocks. Obama's 1.5% GDP  Did nothing for the economy.trumps deregulation and an optomistic economy....thank you #45 MAGA!
500 2018-01-14 17:14:54 Yes but stocks=401k=EVERYONES retirement. Pension plans are no more. This expands past the rich and well into middle class. Then there is the issue of employment and overall economy. 3 years is a long time and a lot can go wrong however.

502 2018-01-14 17:14:15 1 half percent in national economic growth due to stimulus packages . And I realize that stocks rising is based on economic growth but it’s also based on optimism . Which is why on Election Day and Inauguration Day the market made huge gains while the economy was still staggnent
503 2018-01-14 17:13:49 I went to lotte at gimpo like 2 days ago, there you see a one whole shelf unsold exo album. Myeongdong have many stocks too.

Im even frustated because love yourself version L and V are all sold out in diff outlets in korea. 
504 2018-01-14 17:13:42 2pm on a saturday. Veg stocks bare, fresh meat bare, tired of it. Decided to use lidl in future
505 2018-01-14 17:11:15 Hi @Chelsea_Fagan, I came here from reading the review in NYT today.  The author disagrees with your investment ideas because his are INSANE.  100% stocks for the first 2 years of a brief 5 year savings goal???  Horrible advice, and unnecessarily risky.
506 2018-01-14 17:10:51 Both of you are just showing ignorance of investing in stocks. It's neither a gamble nor something only the rich have a privilege to. Many people who weren't rich became wealthy by investing in stocks. Diligent research mitigates risk and 3rd party management cuts into profits.
507 2018-01-14 17:10:22 Lying about how he won.  Of course the stocks are doing well, he's throwing out regulations right and left
508 2018-01-14 17:10:18 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
509 2018-01-14 17:09:52 The stock market reflects the viability of businesses that employ Americans. It's a measuring stick. You don't have to own stocks to benefit from its up tic.
510 2018-01-14 17:09:48 Part (not in yellow) about selling ALL you stocks is interesting.
511 2018-01-14 17:09:30 No, you have it backwards. The stock market is growing because of economic growth. There is no stock market growth without a growing economy. Stocks are a backward indicator.

I'm not sure what you mean by 1 half percentage increase. In what? Revenue? Profit? Over what period?
512 2018-01-14 17:09:21 I hear of jobs closing. Where are the jobs so people can make a living and support there familys. Stock market Humm. I believe it is run by the rich. So they are using the money they are saving In taxes and buying more ln stocks. Instead of what you said they would do
513 2018-01-14 17:08:45 Tip of the day: pull out your stocks
514 2018-01-14 17:08:25 If you knew over the next 10 years that stocks were gonna beat bonds, how much would you wager that Vanguard Total Stock Index beats Vanguard Balanced Index? It’s the same concept
515 2018-01-14 17:07:57 Like analyst opinions, stocks or sports.
516 2018-01-14 17:07:45 You dont seen to understand what 'Animal Spirits' are? You dont seem to understand that there are only around 3,000 publicly traded Corporations but there are 28 MILLION businesses in America. 

All businesses got Tax cuts. That means 27,997,000 companies cant buyback stocks.
517 2018-01-14 17:06:48 And who owns the stocks of those companies that benefit - those owners include pension funds, mutual funds, and individual stock owners.  We are a middle class retired husband and wife who are very happy with the 2018 tax cut bill.  Our IRA's are growing!
518 2018-01-14 17:06:45 Thanks , is there resistance point like in stocks? At what value please?
519 2018-01-14 17:04:37 It's not unusual for shorts to go long. The Feshbachs did years ago. I am sure Ackman would be long $HLF if he felt he could make a buck. I don't get the fascination people have with shorts buying stocks and (like Cohodes and Hempton) becoming all-out stock promoters and shills.
520 2018-01-14 17:04:22 Bakit wala ng stocks? 
O 
Ubos na talaga.
521 2018-01-14 17:03:35 Don't people buy stocks because it entitles them to a profit share and possession of a part of the underlying company?
522 2018-01-14 17:03:16 70% of deplorables who voted for your orange racist self don't own stocks
523 2018-01-14 17:02:20 Senang lah dah ada org kirakan stocks, so lepas ni mak hanya handle reports. Seghonoknyaaaa...
524 2018-01-14 17:02:18 Another white robe racist. Your true colors are such that, I hope you hang onto your stocks.
525 2018-01-14 17:02:03 I dont have any contemporary stocks or shares tweets on my page....only crypto......which i'm proud of :) Surrounded by FUD 24/7 cause i'm hard core like that
526 2018-01-14 17:02:00 $insg but it will be one of the top stocks turnaround plays in 18.  Breakup value is minimum 1.5x the current price + its in 4 of the hottest areas of market #5G, #smartcities, #telematics, and #iot

530 2018-01-14 17:00:10 BOI axa tax advantage - Benchmark nifty 50 and holds stocks average of market cap of 13,000 Cr. Lol. :P These bastards can go any limit to claim outperformance. Looks complete avoid to me.
531 2018-01-14 17:00:02 Do you know of any Chinese firms in need of Soybeans imports? We have large stocks of Soybean for export and we are capable of exporting between 10-50 metric tonnes monthly.
532 2018-01-14 16:59:11 Nice photo of #Trump playing golf when he’s working around the clock for the American ppl! #MAGA The man never sleeps! #HatersGonnaHate #TrumpWon get over it! #Trump2020 #TrumpIsAGenius #TrumpIsOurPresident #TrumpIsNotARacist #stocks #TrumpWinning
533 2018-01-14 16:57:48 So you measure the economy by only one metric. Stocks closed at record highs 77 times. Close to 4% economic growth. Lowest unemployment claims in 50 years. 2 million jobs added. Night and day from the obama admin.
534 2018-01-14 16:57:36 For us Americans, especially in Midwest and South-we don’t put credence in the MSM. We know what’s going on.  Our stocks and accounts show since Pres. Trump went in. We don’t laugh at him. We take him and our money seriously.
535 2018-01-14 16:56:47 Donate to cancer research, pay my nieces and nephews tuitions, invest in stocks and buy a three bedroom three bathroom house
536 2018-01-14 16:56:13 Thank You Carlos,
If the Senior Prefered Stocks are liability’s and were declared paid in full or null and void, would that Administrative Action allow for a built in asset rich FnF to release then relist ?
537 2018-01-14 16:55:39 The average American doesn’t own stocks! We don’t give a crap that super rich people are making money on the stock market.
538 2018-01-14 16:55:29 Why do you now lie in the 3rd person? Is this going to be a constant thing? Or is it because someone else is tweeting for you? Really Smart genius do not do that. You also do not deserve the credit for stocks.
539 2018-01-14 16:55:22 $LDSI penny potential.
540 2018-01-14 16:55:21 Stock market has been great this last year. No contributes but my stocks grew by over $7000. It took me years and contributions to grow that much before President Trump.
541 2018-01-14 16:54:58 Yes, when companies can borrow at 0% and buy back their own stocks can really prompt up the market...its like Trump's fortune going bankrupt 4X ridding debt of terrible business decisions...brilliant!
542 2018-01-14 16:54:45 @tastytraderMike Hey Mike! Been watching a few of your shows on TT. Do you guys use charting to analyze underlying stocks?
543 2018-01-14 16:54:19 $FRFS now we do polls to see what stocks to buy? Yea, let's see how that works out for you.. hahaha
544 2018-01-14 16:53:23 Yooo easiest places to start: 1. I like @RobinhoodApp because NO FEES, super user-friendly + can choose and buy your own stocks. 2. @acorns is great for automating your investing and reinvesting/growing your $$ without really needing to think about it
545 2018-01-14 16:52:25 I would personally have zero problem with bump stocks being moved to the NFA list.
546 2018-01-14 16:49:25 2nd for Mike Stocks today at Gloucester's 50k, about 3hr 12.

547 2018-01-14 16:48:47 just ordered some root stocks to graft scions from our newest apple tree grown from a pip. #apples
548 2018-01-14 16:48:44 This does sound interesting. Question from a noob: looks like I'd need some sort of coin buying program (similar to Robinhood, but for coins instead of stocks)? Is that correct?
549 2018-01-14 16:48:22 The media and adults say 
we don’t have willpower
condemning us like stocks

I'm voting for #BTS @BTS_twt for #BestBoyBand at the #iHeartAwards

550 2018-01-14 16:48:17 This of course still assumes US Production increasing monthly by 100kbd to end 2018 at 10,750 mbd and also assumes ZERO draws from SPR.  In the absence of large new projects coming online, we are headed to sub 300 mb in US stocks? I must have an error somewhere?
551 2018-01-14 16:47:53 Stocks are up! That's because you've been sold to the corporations. Sheesh!
552 2018-01-14 16:44:31 So just how does a high Dow Jones average help the average American?  You seem to be under the impression that everyone owns stocks.  I don't think that many of the 20 million minimum wage workers in the US have an investment portfolio.  Please resign.
553 2018-01-14 16:43:31 Lmao. Sure the stock markets are great again!! But middle class folks get nothing out of high stock and feel nothing on high stocks through the economy. Glad your pockets are being filled. #insidetraders #weasels

556 2018-01-14 16:41:23 With increased foreign investment in US stocks and 52% of US citizens with NO investment in stock market, what benefits, if any, does this really have for the broad swath of middle and lower income Americans?   Zip Zero Zilch
557 2018-01-14 16:40:32 Over sixty percent of our nations citizens don’t own stocks. Your tax cut benefitted the one percent. Your homeboys. Do you seriously not understand the fiscal year in dc. You get the credit you deserve. None.
558 2018-01-14 16:39:24 Stock market is only for the rich- doesn’t trickle down! Poor have no stocks! Please get real! That doesn’t get them health care!
559 2018-01-14 16:39:20 ...taking credit for. Obama's stock market had a bigger % rise than yours; your numbers are building on his. But 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10%, and most of the 50% of Americans who own ANY stock have it tied up in their retirement and thus at risk when collapse...
560 2018-01-14 16:38:15 I'm just saying spare me the hyperbole. Stocks go down, it happens. Its the macro picture that matters.

572 2018-01-14 16:31:07 Trump, do you know how difficult it is to keep track of taxes with crypto? It is more difficult than stocks. you not only have to log what you mine, but also what you trade, what you gain, what you lose, what you buy,  and when you cash out. and the price fluctuates. at 40%!
573 2018-01-14 16:30:16 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

577 2018-01-14 16:25:08 The President and Treasury Secretary have said “look at you check stubs in February “ let’s do that as reported from WSJ the average paycheck will not move until March and the average weekly check will move up $3.58 ! Stocks are overvalued on the tax cut.

580 2018-01-14 16:22:22 Because it's NOT all from you! Stocks have been on the rise since 2009, Obama got that going, not you. You did not bring us out of the recession, Obama did, and you have not "CREATED" all those jobs, it's run off from Obama. READ AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK! I'll give u credit 4 lying.

583 2018-01-14 16:19:28 The stock market isn't indicative of how well people are doing. Most Americans can't afford to and don't invest in stocks.
584 2018-01-14 16:18:25 It's pitiful they would go that far to do the People like that But folks They will do anything!! Our economy is great stocks unreal ! jobs !! Building our Military back after Obama had them taking old parts off planes !! We The People are so happy !!!
585 2018-01-14 16:17:19 You can still invest in start-ups. There's just more paperwork. You can still invest in projects with a fair distribution early on. You can still invest in stocks. Why in the world are you so obsessed with such a high risk investment? When these bubbles pop people get hurt.

630 2018-01-14 15:52:31 Have you sold your stocks yet?
631 2018-01-14 15:52:18 Lest we not forget the Japanese crash of the early 1990's. 

Whatever goes up WILL come down.

Too bad #PresidentShithole 's followers who are lower wage earners who don't have stocks don't seem to understand that more $$$ for corporations doesn't mean more $$$ in their pockets.
632 2018-01-14 15:51:34 The best President ever he is changing the economy significantly dont just go to dow numbers if you dont believe it go through individual stocks and you will see companies have taken off this year and really improved the liberals need to look up more of the economic growth
633 2018-01-14 15:51:07 It was NO accident.
Either was the shooting in Vegas. #NoAccident just an attack on bump stocks. The body in the room was not the #Shooter.

634 2018-01-14 15:50:51 My stocks went up sense trumps presidency
635 2018-01-14 15:49:34 I have invested with Old Mutual but never have I heard of this investment package R4.50p/m? On what do they invest that money? I mean not even stocks or shares have that low entry price
636 2018-01-14 15:48:28 Depends where u are based. In central London, Curzo Soho stocks Monmouth Coffee, has plugs & good WiFi & is one of the few places I can actually get shit done. The lobby of BFI Stephen St isn’t a bad shout either.
637 2018-01-14 15:47:40 Are you shorting blockchain stocks? $riot $Lfin $kodk ?
638 2018-01-14 15:47:16 Tell that to the Carrier or Walmart workers that lost their jobs. Common folks don't own stocks. God love ya 
639 2018-01-14 15:46:24 The Epic stock markets only help those invested in stocks. The rich get richer, is that you? Are you feeling the impact of that stock market? Most middle and lower class people can’t invest in the stick market so they won’t reel the benefits of a great stock market.
640 2018-01-14 15:45:47 You don’t think legalization is already baked into these stocks?
641 2018-01-14 15:45:19 1/2 of the country doesnt own stocks, so...

644 2018-01-14 15:43:52 @NancyPelosi Bread crumbs is the crumby stimulus checks sent to people. A one time shot of alliance money. Thanks for nothing dad! Trump tax cuts has a very useful and many employees are getting bonuses and more hiring and stocks are rising which means my retirement portfolio up!
645 2018-01-14 15:42:35 All the rich are gleefully investing in stocks so that will run up the market. The economy is going to follow its usual flow.
646 2018-01-14 15:42:01 Day-trading crypto now is largely the same waste of time that day-trading stocks was in the original .com boom. 

The winners (e.g. Bezos) sat down, got to work, and focused on creating real long-term value.
647 2018-01-14 15:41:57 Hi Dani, we don't have an end date pencilled in yet, but it's while stocks last - you'd better hurry if you want to bag a bargain!
648 2018-01-14 15:41:16 $4800で1500集まるので安いと思ってバイナンスに資金移動中です。  届いたら1000は確保しようかと思います。$PHILSも集めたいんですがStocksの板おかしくないですか？
649 2018-01-14 15:41:12 Amazon Stocks just hit 1300 bucks each and all my shares vest tomorrow. 2018 is looking to be a great year so far.
650 2018-01-14 15:41:06 And the tax bill will cause a crash in 2 years, people don’t have healthcare & stocks are no indication of the health of the “not wealthy.”
651 2018-01-14 15:40:16 So what about Americans who don't have stocks or knows anything about the stock markets what is he doing for them. How is he making their life better. What an extra $50 in paycheck from new tax law ???
652 2018-01-14 15:39:33 Obama got the stocks climbing, you sit and watch. you claim tax cuts mean economic growth as Walmart closes Sam's stores
653 2018-01-14 15:37:45 Hey @InstantPotUK What’s happening with UK stocks of the Instant Pot please?
654 2018-01-14 15:36:49 Um, really? 
Black unemployment 17 yr low.
Hispanic historic low. 
ALL unemployment historic low.
Stocks historic high.
Illegal immigration down 70%.
Millions of Amercans are getting a bonus. 
AND, Trump and the supposedly do-nothing Sessions are draining the swamp.
655 2018-01-14 15:34:45 Note: One more write-up coming out.  

It has to do with #credibility & #counterpunching & it will be directed at @dames_rory, @Amber_Stocks, @ChristenPress & @Sloot22. 

Why?

Because their 2 teams are the ONLY 2 teams in #Chicago w/o a title.

656 2018-01-14 15:34:03 Superb results...
657 2018-01-14 15:33:30 President Trump, for 8 years my retirement account stayed flat, in one years it has increased 300, 000.00.  I didn’t change any of my stocks, the economy is just better, thank u President Trump!
658 2018-01-14 15:32:12 No debts. Tons of cash in stocks.
659 2018-01-14 15:32:07 Regular everyday middle class folks invest in stocks via their retirement plans through work. In addition, broke people don't/can't create jobs or help the economy. Save some money so that you too can better your situation. That's not for someone else to do for you.
660 2018-01-14 15:31:10 .@Dr_Levenson_NH refuses to give straight answer on deadly bump stocks on @WMUR9 Close Up. Need a yes or no: will he support ban on bump stocks? And how will he help promote #gunsense if elected? #nhpolitics #nh02
661 2018-01-14 15:30:51 "Hyperinflating currency" can be a hyperbolic term; I prefer the sovereign bond market attempting to escape USD devaluation by fleeing into stocks.
662 2018-01-14 15:30:46 My New book "Online Entrepreneurs" will be Coming Soon around April 25th, 2018. It is a good Book for Small Businesses and I also touch on the Bitcoin Crypto-Currency Stock Market and Penny Stocks to help guide you in the right direction to becoming more Financially Comfortable.
663 2018-01-14 15:30:14 Unfortunately, im selling all my Unilever (Vaseline) stocks bc nobody is going to be jaggin off after Big Ben takes Bortles service to the bathroom
664 2018-01-14 15:30:14 So what does this mean for Stocks?
665 2018-01-14 15:30:12 The rise of bitcoin has been compared by some market watchers to the bubble in technology stocks in the late 1990s. Buy in strictly as a speculative play and use only money you can afford to lose in its entirety. Best advice: keep this stuff well away from your retirement fund.
666 2018-01-14 15:28:31 Think I’ve solved the #teenage #sexting crisis. 1/
1. Let everyone know asking for a #nudepic is illegal; pressure of any kind, double illegal.
2. Bring bank village stocks (work for many there). First request offence 6 hrs in stocks (no phone)..
667 2018-01-14 15:28:11 which stocks sir
668 2018-01-14 15:27:52 correct. there is zero long-term correlation between U.S. stocks and the U.S. dollar
669 2018-01-14 15:27:44 And I can bet  your ass that if stocks and economy crashed when he got elected you would blame Trump for that also, lol.
670 2018-01-14 15:27:02 Yes my stocks and portfolio are doing great, but I'm afraid your policies are going to destroy my nest egg I have worked so hard to create.
671 2018-01-14 15:26:48 What are you talking about?  You give yourself credit every day!

#potus #economy #stocks
672 2018-01-14 15:26:25 I suggest corrections several times to @POTUS. Still no example or reason to label him “racist “ asking again how is he a racist? What action? Not your feelings but actions?
673 2018-01-14 15:26:21 As in stocks? Ive wanted to get into investing in stocks but idk how
674 2018-01-14 15:25:29 Bro govt banned Chinese thread?
675 2018-01-14 15:23:42 Actually stocks matter to people with 401Ks & pensions. That is a great deal larger number than 10%.
676 2018-01-14 15:23:23 @Orange_France vend des Huawei P10 lite défectueux. Les stocks à la vente sont pleins mais stocks en rupture pour échanger les d'appareils neufs HS. Hotline 3900 fuyante. Le client laissé à l'abandon sans information pdt des semaines malgré relances. Inadmissible @60millions
677 2018-01-14 15:23:14 Neutrality is exchanges having an equal interest in both stocks doing well (eg trading 1 mm shares). Having superior economics in a particular security doing well non-neutral. Particularly when that sec could help distort the market. Thx for feedback :)
678 2018-01-14 15:22:55 Good stocks
679 2018-01-14 15:20:00 You never will, Obama set the trend upwards in the economy & stocks took off way before your #ShitHole crew arrived. You, shithole president, took our money and gave it to yourself & alike. Your shithole taxDeformation set the trend to go back to 2008 collapse again but worse.
680 2018-01-14 15:19:22 Let's see.. should I pay food and utilities or buy stocks? Hmmm... tough choice. 75% of Ameica don't play the market. But keep bragging about what the wealthy do, it shows exactly what you all are about.
681 2018-01-14 15:19:20 Think of the penny stocks, bro
682 2018-01-14 15:18:16 Actually the stock market did better under the obama administration and most of your supporters don’t own stocks so who you trying to fool?
683 2018-01-14 15:17:23 How’s about dragging some of that money back #Carillion have been paying to shareholders as dividends for the last few years. 
Isn’t trading in stocks and shares supposed to carry an element of risk ??
684 2018-01-14 15:16:12 Put cha money in some stocks it can change your life
685 2018-01-14 15:13:58 Not excel? I clean up my notebook about once a week and put all the info in long term storage for updates.
686 2018-01-14 15:13:15 Lying Republican, multi millionaire hack @Varneyco from
fox and thieves may puke it but it does not make it true.

What has been happening World wide? Stocks have risen because long term interest rates are at historic lows. This was started under President Obama, not you.
687 2018-01-14 15:10:39 Spoken like someone who doesn't understands stocks and trade at all. Let's say WalMart's business soars because of stock market gain. They get more investors, more money per owned capita, and they build more stores, give more people jobs, and right now, even increase wages.
688 2018-01-14 15:10:13 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
689 2018-01-14 15:09:41 No one stocks them round here so I would have to order them and the test nipples, so why not?
690 2018-01-14 15:09:24 Stocks closed Friday just short of 26000.
691 2018-01-14 15:09:20 The way stocks are jumping right now, I think it's high time I made my move too
692 2018-01-14 15:08:13 50% of the country doesn’t own a 401k or personal stocks. Just like ur tax plan, a rising market massively redistributes wealth from the poor and struggling middle class to the wealthy 1% who have be capturing a higher portion of US wealth for years.  

NOT A MIDDLE CLASS MIRACLE
693 2018-01-14 15:05:56 MAC AO5 NOW AVAILABLE !! LIMITED STOCKS ONLY

696 2018-01-14 15:02:55 While PM Modi is leading well our country, building strong and good relations with other countries brilliantly- Cong party is degrading and failing miserably in mannerism knowledge  ethics of politics  by only insulting PM of own country!They are becoming laughing stocks openly !
697 2018-01-14 15:02:21 I believe the indices can continue higher because of structural issues, momentum and rotation. I still see plenty of strong setups in individual stocks.
698 2018-01-14 15:02:17 because a booming economy, fewer Blacks unemployed, stocks at all time high and businesses coming back to U.S. is a terrible thing.

700 2018-01-14 15:01:31 The stock market rally has been grounded in profitability, which has nothing to do with trump.

Stocks bottomed in March 2009 and has been going up steadily ever since.

Trump stepped in shit because the economy and stock markets had been improving for years before he was elected
701 2018-01-14 15:01:04 #Electric #Car #EV are #Wonderful But More Needs To Be Done With Work Commercial Vehicles #SchoolBuses #Trucks Etc That's where #Adomani Inc. #ADOM comes in with their #Impressive retro-fitted electric drivetrain after the holiday volitivity the stocks will surge
702 2018-01-14 15:00:50 Wrong, we give you credit for destroying America, being the most hated president, stealing the election from @HillaryClinton , being the most racist president and person in the world, being the biggest pervert president paying off hookers to shut up. We don't care about stocks.
703 2018-01-14 14:59:38 what wrong i said he is a selfie expert thats it
704 2018-01-14 14:57:27 I tried you last time! Am free again this weekend if you are - would like to meet and talk stocks and life
705 2018-01-14 14:56:39 Nobody doubts you are 100% responsible for the economic revival. I thank you, & you alone, for the increases in my accounts. The only stocks doing well at the prospect of a Crooked Hillary administration were gun stocks because people were buying guns before she took them away.

707 2018-01-14 14:54:22 Où alors c'est tellement "mauvais" pour eux qu'ils font plus les stocks 
708 2018-01-14 14:54:20 You have stocks if you have any retirement fund. You benefited. If you don’t have one, you need to do that.

711 2018-01-14 14:53:10 I'd like to point out something that I believed to be very important. The stock market is not the economy and that's Not with a capital N. The stock market is making money for people who own stocks i.e. shareholders not the u.s. population
712 2018-01-14 14:53:01 One point I can help you
- the exchanges are trading all alts in bitcoin

But this strength disappearing as more alts traded directly in FIAT.
Small people do not calculated the price in bitcoins.
Tesla and Apple stock holder do care about price relative to microsoft stocks

718 2018-01-14 14:47:47 @KingofdaFay they no different that penny stocks 
719 2018-01-14 14:46:43 You seem very bullish on $TDOC. Getting me interested in it. I think $SPLK also had a play in it with internet connectivity and sending info to the doctor and if the doctor sees something, then they will call you. Good to identify next gen stocks right now.
720 2018-01-14 14:45:46 You can buy those anywhere pero pag endorsement limited edition and limited stocks 
721 2018-01-14 14:44:49 I truly appreciate Jamie's investment advice.  Knowing that the demand for blood pressure medication is on the rise among many liberals, I am going to immediately invest in pharmaceutical stocks.
722 2018-01-14 14:44:19 The Dow is comprised of only 30 stocks & price weighted

<50% of Americans own stock/mutual fund or have a 401k

90% of all equities owned by top 5% of owners

Top 1% own 42% of nations wealth

U.S. dollar declined 10% since Simple Jack took office, eroding your purchasing power
723 2018-01-14 14:43:32 What will you be investing in for 2018? Gold? Stocks? Property? Cryptocurrency? ETFs? Mutual Funds?
724 2018-01-14 14:43:23 BTW,  Obama was the one who brought the country out of a recession! Stocks rose,  unemployment down,  jobs created,  and this is the thing that matters most: he brought dignity,  respect and empathy to the WH,  NONE OF WHICH WE HAVE NOW!
725 2018-01-14 14:42:47 Er.... no it isn't. Fish stocks have been destroyed NYC the eu allowing Spanish boats to fish during spawning seasons. British fish stocks are lower than ever.
726 2018-01-14 14:42:15 Agacies insentives rackets stocks dunn
727 2018-01-14 14:41:59 $dime on sale at 1 satoshi over on Livecoin... while stocks last 
728 2018-01-14 14:41:53 4-7% is a huge difference especially when you could've used a different move and probably got nearly the same amount of damage while still being able to kill 4-7% earlier with said kill move, we're talking about taking stocks here which is really important in a 2 stock game.
729 2018-01-14 14:41:13 Just like the drips I make everyday day trading with stocks I research and watch the price movement on to make enough gains to show a net profit on. But alas my daily gains is just crumbs I put away to gather into a big pile of crumbs.

731 2018-01-14 14:39:40 "The most important dynamic to focus on in the market is growth," said Sandip Bhagat, chief investment officer at Whittier Trust. Risks to rally exist, but added: "They pale in comparison to the economic growth we're seeing."

Dr_Stocks - a Correction of 10% = buying opportunity
732 2018-01-14 14:39:31 Yes you are also you all have to keep up the stocks ha ha
733 2018-01-14 14:39:08 The stock market values individual stocks by incorporating all available information that will affect the dollar denominated value of the firm. It's is by definition forward-looking.
734 2018-01-14 14:38:36 I dont give too much of so called tips.I am an investor and trader.Have given many stocks with more than 100%rn

736 2018-01-14 14:37:44 Stocks aren’t a measure of the economy, but if you want to use it, Obama did better.
Thanks @BarackObama

738 2018-01-14 14:36:21 Trumps incompetency is mind boggling,but as long as the stocks go up everything is o.k.Sick.Calls countries names,and the next day reads how great MLK was,with three black men behind him.
739 2018-01-14 14:35:46 Señor Goatee should have said, "If stock buy-backs slow, or end, conditional upon CB balance sheet reductions, then stocks will go down" The boys out in La-La Land sometimes view things in only one-dimension.
740 2018-01-14 14:35:44 What are you talking about?  Economy has been climbing for the passed 7 years thanks to Obama.  Look at your stocks for the past 7 years. I bet you will see an increase. Let’s go by facts. And not your lies.
741 2018-01-14 14:34:56 Oh forgot about you. Yea your source had no proof just rumors like most news media’s . And bump stocks? Really? You realize you can bumpfire without bumpstocks right? And no military in the world uses an AR-15 so you’re wrong on everything. As usual
742 2018-01-14 14:34:31 folks lunch boxes and houses to be sure there is not a hint of carbos anywhere in them, and they will be put in stocks in their local village if any is found, and they will be pelted with half cooked pork chops..?
743 2018-01-14 14:34:30 Sorry guys, not taking stock sales! also GCF badge site replied she doesn’t have stocks!
744 2018-01-14 14:33:28 I didn't wish to fall onto their levels but I ain't taking it anymore. Your groups agencies might spend money from selling those stocks to remove hashtag but big hit will rather prefer buying Gucci with those money. You see the weigtage   there acts holds

746 2018-01-14 14:32:15 No surprise, just like the CEO selling stocks lol
747 2018-01-14 14:30:17 You do realize that most billionaires aren’t billionaires with liquid money. They are billionaires on paper with property and stocks.
748 2018-01-14 14:30:08 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
749 2018-01-14 14:29:53 Fleurage-nim seems has pile of stocks of GyuHan’s photos ;;;;;;A;;;;;;; YASSSS
750 2018-01-14 14:29:51 80%? That's not true at all. I have a 401k along with plenty of other people I know. We certainly do care how well the stock market does. Even if you don't have a 401k or stocks, you should care! Take an economics class & you will see how it's very important.
751 2018-01-14 14:29:44 ils font pareil avec les nouveaux médocs ... ils les fabriquent et s'ils sont pas efficaces ou même dangereux, ils écoulent les stocks, souvent dans les hostos
752 2018-01-14 14:29:04 so continues the trend that Obama is mostly responsible for, the stock market only helps people who have the right investments in the right stocks. So, how are you making money for the government? All you're doing is trying to overwrite Obama's name with your own. fake president.
753 2018-01-14 14:28:03 Small bonuses instead of much needed raises. A stock market being manipulated by corporations buying and running up the price of their own stocks. Minimum wage jobs on the rise... fools gold economics.
754 2018-01-14 14:28:02 This is fucking ridiculous. Stocks aren't owned by middle class. Only the top 10% of Americans can even afford to dabble in market. The fact Trump and his pals are getting richer means nothing.
755 2018-01-14 14:27:34 Now according to your logic my stock investments were wrong! They were stagnant under Obama but those same stocks are no longer stagnant under Trump!
756 2018-01-14 14:26:01 Long-term holding at this point associated to quality stocks, with good management, and international goals imo.  CAN market is already priced in. If not overpriced in.
757 2018-01-14 14:26:01 Remember the poor and many in the middle class don’t own any stocks. The income inequality is only getting worse.
758 2018-01-14 14:23:28 isn't that, if there are unsold stocks they could easily return it? that's how consignment works. Unless if He was paid a separate fee that he assures the company that it would entirely be sold because that would already be considered sold and he has to keep it for himself
759 2018-01-14 14:23:21 People like to look for seasonal patterns on stocks, but for MJ I feel it is premature.  Way to much emotional trading. FOMO drives it up. Panic sells it down. Violent choppy charts. Any patterns people see have probably been coincidental.
760 2018-01-14 14:23:14 Most Americans DO own stocks you jackhole. Just because you don't personally trade stocks doesn't mean you don't own stakes in the market.
761 2018-01-14 14:23:00 This is the same Buffett that avoided tech stocks for decades then takes a $15b punt in Apple. People can change.

They buyback more stocks.
That drives up market&their/UR wealth(not ours)
They buyback more stocks,make more money(NOT us),market goes up.....until it stops&we see a drop off say 300 points 1 day! 
BOOM!That crash will be bad.

765 2018-01-14 14:19:31 Maybe this year’s brand new tax plan to ridiculously tax every single crypto trade (as apposed to just the realized gains, like with stocks) has created enough FUD to pucker the asses of even the crypto whales.  Bye bye crypto gold rush.

779 2018-01-14 14:15:14 So let me understand this according to you Obama stocks up 250 percent in 8 years. Never hit the highs they hit in the past 6 months. Now Trump stocks up according to you, 30 percent in 11 months. Seems to me that if you do the math Trump will beat that.
780 2018-01-14 14:14:27 Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. RussiaAs said before, only you, family and rich donors benefit from stocks and tax scam. 
Russia. Russia. Russia. Russia. We will not forget.
781 2018-01-14 14:13:47 Stock Market numbers do not mean much to ordinary folk. Those are Fake measurements of success for Trump and the wealthy, the people who really benefit from those Stock Market rallies—Approximately 20 percent of stock holders own 92 percent of the stocks. Fake News again Trump.
782 2018-01-14 14:13:07 Yes, I believe I do. I've got a few small retirement plans from places I've worked and if I remember correctly part of the portfolio includes stocks. I have no idea in what, honestly. I'm neither stable nor genius but at least I'm genuine.

787 2018-01-14 14:11:50 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
788 2018-01-14 14:11:40 Obama's stimulus package ended Oct 2017. This is fact. Growth came from that. Trump has no stimulus package to take it's place therefore a bubble has emerged. Rising stocks are due to investment of 10% of the population. It does not mean Economic growth.

793 2018-01-14 14:09:55 Btw, ATT is laying off 30,000. Walmart closing Sam 60+ stores. less than 1/2 of Americans have access to the stock market, & the Dow is only 30 stocks. the important number is permanent wage growth - so far - one time payments to people they will layoff soon, so it’s severance.
794 2018-01-14 14:08:19 It is a nothing-burger. How is this connected to a CANADIAN COMPANY? Uranium One is a CANADIAN company which owned several uranium mines in the US. Russians oligarchs purchased stock in this CANADIAN company. Just like you would buy stocks in Apple or Pepsi.
795 2018-01-14 14:07:52 Trading is glorified, specifically day trading. imo moving slower or dedicating part of portfolio to investing will lead to better results for most

It’s tough because this is the most active investment that many have ever been in. Stocks and retirement investing usually passive

799 2018-01-14 14:06:26 You need to cite real sources outside of your Faux News megaphone cronies. Say who is profiting from the rise in stocks. Mention layoffs and closures. Americans losing health insurance, tax deductions, failure to renew CHIP, punting on DACA, shifting blame. There. Fixed it.
800 2018-01-14 14:05:19 I love that Trump’s victory controls your every thought. You don’t have a moment where you aren’t haunted. Poor snowflake. We survived the worst President ever for 8 years, Barry Obama. You will survive Trump if you try. #MAGA Enjoy your tax break and record stocks earnings.
801 2018-01-14 14:05:19 Those indices are not indicative of the inside of the market.  Any moron knows the top performing stocks are picked for the DOW S&P and NASDQ.  Oh wait you don't know that do you
802 2018-01-14 14:05:17 Since you already said that you made your richer friends a lot richer, then I guess you are right. However, everyone else (including your base) are not benefitting from these tax breaks. They don't have stocks and bonds. They WILL feel the fallout of your wreckless deregulation
803 2018-01-14 14:05:00 I know we are all so happy now but be prepared to ride out the next correction and stay in for the next cycle. The worse thing we can do is run with the herd weather stocks go up or down.  If my husband and I had liquidated our accounts during the 2008 downturn, we can't retire.
804 2018-01-14 14:04:55 If you have a retirement plan through work odds are pretty good it's got stocks in it somewhere. Not to say they're rolling in cash but lots more folks own at least a few stocks this way. I'm sure I do somewhere.
805 2018-01-14 14:03:05 You obviously were not trading stocks back then. Looks like you just read books on it

The economy is good thanks to the hard work that President Obama did. Your tax scsm and bonuses do not offset all the layoffs they came with them, why don't you mention this?
Check out the stocks that are rising, it's not across the board.

827 2018-01-14 13:57:01 He's done nothing for the economy. Don't confuse high stocks as economic growth. Economic models predict less than 1% GDP growth which is nothing. And with no stimulus package it adds to the problem. The stock market is in a bubble. It will burst which means recession.

829 2018-01-14 13:56:45 @imseanpenn We elected Donald Trump. As haters & liars try to derail him, he continues strong! PPL like you prefer to see the Country fail. Our POTUS has single handedly lifted our economy, real estate, stocks, created jobs, elevated consumer confidence & has given us tax reform.
830 2018-01-14 13:55:11 Anyone who had a 401k in 2009 and didn’t have gains needs a new fund manager or choose better stocks.  This trend began shortly after Pres Obama was elected.
831 2018-01-14 13:55:04 We look at our 401k & stocks in the past month--we've never seen so much growth in one single month! Thank you @realdonaldTrump
832 2018-01-14 13:54:04 Fast Stock Market growth is NOT an indicator of a strong economy.  It took 17 yrs for tech stocks to recover trillions from the dot-com crash (Think Qualcomm)The market high in 2006 dropped 22% in 8 days in 2007 crushing the middle class. Stocks are overvalued now(think Amazon)!

Don't know if you've heard of @maecenasart, but they're going live in Q1 with a blockchain app that allows fractions of fine art to be tradeable, "democratising" ownership. A very interesting use case for blockchain, allowing fine art ownership to be as accessible as stocks.

876 2018-01-14 13:18:40 you can’t atomic swap dollar, or euros, or oil, or stocks. You have to change altcoin for btc, btc for cash, cash for stocks etc. Technically you could “atomic swap” QASH for amazon shares.

883 2018-01-14 13:04:23 The majority of Americans don't have any savings, so how do you propose they purchase stocks if they're strapped for cash?
884 2018-01-14 13:03:15  dogs are family man, I get yaaa, you’re the only one who gets me  x
885 2018-01-14 13:01:10 Of course, but you only know in hindsight which stocks were truly superior.
886 2018-01-14 13:00:44 That’s how much you lookin at if you were to sell ? I know jack shit about stocks
887 2018-01-14 12:59:04 The year is 2049. A 75-year-old Nigel Farage concedes that a seventh Brexit referendum may be necessary to keep him relevant. Stocks in SPAM and vinegar soar. Theresa Maybot exterminates South Wales.
888 2018-01-14 12:58:37 Walang chat yung asus clark.  So I assume na nakuha nila ung stocks nila?  Yes please.  Kasi problema tlga to pag hndi

890 2018-01-14 12:56:04 MNC stocks move based on the whims of the parent. Their financial performance is so totally dependent on how the parent treats them.
891 2018-01-14 12:55:42 The economy is "booming" @cspanwj? Callers "buying blue chip Stocks!" Really? Let's have an unofficial poll, "How many listeners REALLY own blue chip Stocks?" #CPANWJBlueChip
892 2018-01-14 12:52:23 Hahaha..true..if you are disciplined in stocks just like with mutual funds..generating 15-20% CAGR is not difficult..you will have some years with 50-70 or even 100% cagr..and then you just need to exit protect that money till you get the next proper opportunity..
893 2018-01-14 12:52:00 Yes dami stocks ng foods sa bahay
894 2018-01-14 12:51:43 Logistics sector provide great value ahead for next 3 to 5 years stocks like Bluedart and Gati
895 2018-01-14 12:50:19 Eh but stocks have checks and balances - industry performance, quarterly earnings, etc.  Crypto really doesn't have much truth poured in.
896 2018-01-14 12:48:20 Michael do you follow specific stocks , if so which ones primarily?
897 2018-01-14 12:47:27 A hope all this info on Sanchez to United is true if he doesn’t united and everyone on here will be fucking laughing stocks including united. Like a said it makes no sense of him signing with city at all #MUFC
898 2018-01-14 12:45:55 1. No negative thoughts about myself or anyone else ( & removing myself from any negative energy) 
2. No complaining. Just doing.
3. Showing gratitude
4. Read. (Started my second book today) 
5. Invest.. in Crypto (haven’t gotten into stocks just yet)
899 2018-01-14 12:44:33 After reading a few of your posts you have proven to not have a clue as to what you are talking about.   Please quit posting.    Most “Normal people” have stocks of some type whether it is in a retirement or investment at the bank.   You also do not know who creates jobs either
900 2018-01-14 12:43:30 Crypto won’t be this volatile forever unfortunatley. Once the bubble bursts it will become normal stocks and shares style volatility. Not as easy or fun spending the rest of your life making 1% profit over a week

905 2018-01-14 12:41:05 Wow... my stocks in my 401k are managed by a 3rd party that I pay...  and I am at best upper middle class which proves anyone who cares about investing in their future can do it
906 2018-01-14 12:41:04 It reminds me one of your old tweet:
If only my stocks could delist and relist again..i.am sure they will be min 2x 
907 2018-01-14 12:40:44 Tapos BINANCE > STOCKS as of the moment
908 2018-01-14 12:40:32 That is pretty far from true.  A fund manager would not go beyond his fund boundaries to buy junk stocks. Offer documents/fund manuals declare the investment philosophies.
909 2018-01-14 12:40:23 8 stocks je pense
910 2018-01-14 12:38:54 Really pissed aren’t you that stocks, employment and the economy is doing this well.

912 2018-01-14 12:35:53 It is also false. I’ve paid on average £5-£7 for years unless it’s really cheap in the north. London is probably more (do they have Halal fish?)
We need our waters back to rebuild fish stocks and communities
913 2018-01-14 12:35:14 Sounds like SOUR GRAPES to me. Not to mention that people not in the top 10% thanks to pensions now have stocks.
914 2018-01-14 12:35:09 Like the stocks? And like the 2000000 Americans receiving bonus? Or that nk is know in talks with sk? Sorry I think the real shit are in your brains .

920 2018-01-14 12:31:25 Yah, lots of noise. The same kind of environment exists in other assets like stocks and Forex etc.  What I have learned over the years is that the market doesn't care which discord server you belong to, unless of course you're pumping and dumping:)

925 2018-01-14 12:26:58 Planet reality vs flat earth
926 2018-01-14 12:23:16 I'm not saying being a pro stockbroker doesn't have its advantages because they actually did beat the cows in the experiment (just by a little) and others, except top bloggers who don't have a clue (I got it wrong earlier). The point is that betting on stocks is mostly luck.
927 2018-01-14 12:23:15 Reality hurts. 3rd world countries are called 3rd countries for a reason.
928 2018-01-14 12:23:09 Tbh I don't give a shit about people's opinion, I'll use stocks if I want to
929 2018-01-14 12:20:46 Well we sold 20% of our uranium to Russia,thanks Hillary so we need to find more.

933 2018-01-14 12:18:56 Vernon put so much of our money in all them blame stocks.  I told him to leave it at Wichita Falls Savings and Loan where we always had it.  Of course we lost it all under old Obama when he took over.   Surprised we're not in a home with 8 years of that kook.

936 2018-01-14 12:17:32 Gee Steve, G.E., AT&T, Milton Bradley and Hershey are Blue Chip stocks and trump Trump Stocks. G it's G.E.
937 2018-01-14 12:16:57 The public stock market is also where licensed investor offload the stocks when the companies they get early access get listed. The crypto market enables average people to get acces to companies that are and will revolutionise the worlds tech, busines and financial industries.

940 2018-01-14 12:13:03 Caller Joe from GA: stocks have been growing since 2013 when the DOW broke its historical high. #45 is not responsible for the trajectory.

947 2018-01-14 12:09:32 If you invest in stocks based on what Mr Win Dow Cleanerman or Mr Bake Ryman has told you. Your an idiot and should give up on investing
948 2018-01-14 12:08:49 This president is not a racist many prominent Black men & women  have said it but Media & Democrats don't want to believe cause then they're main talking point  would be lost racism & they have nothing else to attack him on. Look at the economy Look at unemployment rates Stocks.
949 2018-01-14 12:08:06 I wonder if our stocks will rise now that people are eating our tide pods.
950 2018-01-14 12:06:28 Sorry. I don’t know. I primarily invest in US stocks.
951 2018-01-14 12:04:52 You can invest in the *public* stock market and buy stocks. That is where 99%+ of the money in equity is.

$1M is too high IMO, but the general idea of limiting who businesses can raise money from is not. Picture Juicero, but open to the public.

956 2018-01-14 12:00:40 Those 5k entry minimums are for mutual funds. You can buy individual stocks if you want.

The reason anyone can chuck $200 into crypto and do well is because the market is highly irrational and a huge bubble. It's literally hard to find anyone not doing well. That's a bad sign.
957 2018-01-14 12:00:38 Serious financial news

Headline News. Mark Zuckerberg loses $3.3 Billion after Facebook stocks fall by 4.5%. He's now worth $74 Billion instead of $77.8 Billion. 

He must be shitting himself  

Maybe some LinkedIn crypto experts could advise him on how to trade it back up

966 2018-01-14 11:53:33 "You can buy stocks. That where most of the wealth is" - what does that even mean? Investors are looking for returns. Crypto is  once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in a new asset class before institutions can. Nice of you to 'protect' us all...

971 2018-01-14 11:51:18 i clean my history after looking at bitcoin stocks
972 2018-01-14 11:48:30 Cryptos aren’t stocks, that’s your first mistake. You should sell now regardless, hurry before you lose all your money
973 2018-01-14 11:46:05 I think one of the reasons is to make sure he has the highest chances of getting shares to short. some brokers have bettet/more borrows for some stocks than the others

982 2018-01-14 11:27:27 Love the Green Parts! As @rachelgillon said, great for stocks. Sauté..milder than onions, great to wrap fish in, roasted with some balsamic, stir fry with some spicy prawns, in a blue cheese tart..... list goes on. Don't waste Use! #loveyourleek
983 2018-01-14 11:26:41 You can buy stocks. That's where most of the wealth is.

Trust me if people are having trouble breaking through some net worth it's not because of angel investing.

Alternatively they can start their own start-up. They get 100% equity until they sell it off.
984 2018-01-14 11:24:44 its becoming so overused in this community to the point where everyone makes curvy headers and MUST SAY that they didnt use any stocks in every single post, like no one cares if its stocks or not, its shite
985 2018-01-14 11:23:22 My initial reaction was minimal contact and if the Ipswich player stays on his feet the Ref speaks to them both.  Blatant cheating to me
986 2018-01-14 11:22:15 Stocks rarely perform in the time frames we predict, & it’s why the market only works for investors having long-term focus. Performance is never linear, up and to the right, year after year. You sometimes have to hold a position for few years before it goes up 100% in 3 months.

990 2018-01-14 11:17:40 Bring back the stocks/small ale/groats/wandering minstrels/ducking stool/mead. Actually I agree with the last one.
991 2018-01-14 11:17:28 well using stocks is another way of designing
992 2018-01-14 11:17:18 If you want to find a multi-bagger - Just scan stocks trading above 200DMA on Weekly or has crossed recently - Soon it's fundamentals will improve too and you'll become a value investor. My investments on Time Technolplast, Zuari Agro came from that, I brag about it at parties.

995 2018-01-14 11:15:42 The stock market affect very few people, only 52% of Americans have stocks, directly or indirectly. Sad to hear that you think a few hundred thousand job is so unimportant.

1002 2018-01-14 11:09:52 Not sure the actual legalization date will be a catalyst. I think that’s all priced in and then some.  The opening weekend could in fact, have ‘disappointing sales’ and the stocks could crash

Also i trust Google more than Indian government 
1006 2018-01-14 11:05:05 Just bc they do doesn’t make ‘em right. When stocks rallied on 11/9/16 after election results, that was somehow BO? & when they fell again the day Brian Ross got the date on Don Jr’s Wikileaks e-mail wrong, that was BO? Then why’d they go up 7k in 1 yr compared to BO’s 9k in 8?

1020 2018-01-14 10:39:30 There is no downside limit for stocks with bad management. Ex:Tree house, Metalyst forgings etc. Better avoid these kind of companies. Look for other opportunities in same sector ex:Som distillers, Radiko, GM

1139 2018-01-14 07:35:47 Most middle class and lower income people work multiple part time jobs that might not offer a 401K. Less than one-third of families in the bottom half of the income percentile own stocks and stock ownership is down 11%. So yippee for the 35% of foreign investors, the 1%...
1140 2018-01-14 07:35:42 And why does Keith look like he wants to sell me stocks
1141 2018-01-14 07:33:39 As Israeli Prime Minister is visiting India from today, Defence, Nuclear Stocks should remain in focus as So many defence deals could be happening.
1142 2018-01-14 07:32:09 Yeah, there are many lined up stocks!

1147 2018-01-14 07:21:53 Wrong.  No stocks but 2 worthless houses.
1148 2018-01-14 07:21:10 (I'm not bragging - opposite: passing along my minimal knowledge; it sucks to hafta do stuff like sell boxed toys you were saving & eat pasta, instead - I've been there all too recently, 'cos I won't do serious sh*t like sell fire stocks just for screwing around money!)
1149 2018-01-14 07:20:31 bull market in stocks started in March 09 , near end of Recession. This market upswing now 103 months old, making it second-longest on record.
Trump can claim credit 11 months at most. The other 92 months upward trajectory took place under President Obama.
1150 2018-01-14 07:19:53 @smartinvestor Expect a week with decent gains 15 to 19 Jan - Ahead of budget stay focused on Fertilizer Stocks and Rail stocks for decent gains !!
1151 2018-01-14 07:13:37 Even with no crackdown, there are issues related to international expansion, crossing from one State to another State with weed in your pocket, financing and investing. Just another backward step for Americans. Canada will take your investment dollars - we have good pot stocks.
1152 2018-01-14 07:13:33 Thank you! I don't have a library in my city that stocks up on books I want to read. Not that piracy is the solution, but this needed to be said.
1153 2018-01-14 07:12:52 You just don’t get it when stocks are up it’s because companies are doing well & business confidence is high exactly what’s needed before employers put on more people more jobs mean more consumers buying more products & it grows & grows & soon even Democrats  have a job
1154 2018-01-14 07:11:53 I wanna invest in some stocks lol
1155 2018-01-14 07:10:08 I don't like that let somebody else handle the business side of things shit. Whether it's music or stocks or whatever, I'm tryna learn how to do it myself whoadie.
1156 2018-01-14 07:08:19 I'll be damned if I don't invest into stocks & miss out on easy money. But I'd also be damned if I just invest without knowing wtf I'm doing.
1157 2018-01-14 07:07:43 I understand; I'm sorry.
I had a bit more cash a while ago & decided to experiment by putting some of it in stocks I felt comfortable with.
I own shares in 4 videogame companies - that's it. Now, mostly just in 3.
1158 2018-01-14 07:07:04 50% of Americans own stocks thru IRAs or 401 plans from employers.. so benefits are not only going to top earners but middle Americans, too

1162 2018-01-14 06:59:34 I still think shes very good, but stocks that wont die and last waaaaay too long just end up being the death of her so often.
1163 2018-01-14 06:54:36 the only people who are going to benefit from this "surge" are the people who make enough money 2 be able 2 invest in stocks. most of trumps supporters arent in that class of people. let's talk about the layoffs now at Macy's Carrier, Walmart and what about those miners jobs huh?
1164 2018-01-14 06:50:14 making bank on crates b, i want to take econ and learn stocks cause of the amount of money i made from pubg crates in the past 2 days (over 2k lel)
1165 2018-01-14 06:49:03 We all have the freedom of choice whether to buy stocks or invest into other portfolios. Investors who gamble on the stock market and win is a tremendous improvement over the 2008 stock market crash that saw a major loss of investor’s money. We all benefit from a bull market.
1166 2018-01-14 06:47:49 Nor today’s Wall Street.                 Ad revenue based corps are hot air stocks.
1167 2018-01-14 06:47:32 The original post is about oil stocks so that's what we're talking about. You on the other hand wanted to change the subject
1168 2018-01-14 06:46:18 i love getting those dthrow 50/50s taking stocks at like 80%. Frame data aside, how isn't this character not high tier?
1169 2018-01-14 06:45:52 @chelseahandler Your stocks investments doing well? You can thank President Trump for that. The Dems has absolutely nothing to do with the records our stock market is setting! It’s all on conservatives. Sorry the flow of drugs has slowed down but we can thank POTUS again!

1171 2018-01-14 06:39:34 How big of a risk is it to invest in stocks ?  
1172 2018-01-14 06:36:45 Oh so if he said “third world country” that would be okay?  We know how he talks and we elected him anyway. My stocks are doing great. Grow up he has colorful language sometimes!  Haven’t you!
1173 2018-01-14 06:35:49 I have invested upto 1 lakh in stocks already with following some stocks I sell them shortly as soon as i get some good profit but people say that we sould stick to some particular stocks forever , What's right according to you sir?

1180 2018-01-14 06:29:53 What exactly was amazing? That he didn't keep any of his election promises or like another dude (Trudeau) inspirational but empty speeches? Or by expanding surveillance? Or by health bill that skyrocketed insurance & pharma stocks?
1181 2018-01-14 06:28:40 Fair enough, I can understand the logic in that for sure. Hot markets like this don't come around all the time. Though entering things like $ASN in the low 1c area hasn't worked out too bad for me, offsets more than a few stocks that don't perform as well.
1182 2018-01-14 06:27:46 You idiots in Hollywood enjoying your stocks performing well thank President Trump for that. Those companies in Hollywood enjoying that tax break you got thank President Trump. Not 1 Dem had any part in it!#shitholecityofHollywood
1183 2018-01-14 06:26:35 We should be driving oil stocks down we should be trying to use his little oil as possible stop putting money in the pockets of the greedy Welp the oil companies that don’t care about us or our families just profits for the wealthy
1184 2018-01-14 06:24:43 Hay NAUBUSAN LANG KASE AKO NG STOCKS PARA SA SIZE NA YON HAHAAHAHAH
1185 2018-01-14 06:22:30 My opinion = Stocks, Bonds, ETF's (Historical proof of success, More known/Stable) > Bitcoin (Trendy, New/Not well known) 
#investing #bitcoin #wealthcreation #business #trends
1186 2018-01-14 06:19:10 Stocks rarely perform in the time frames we predict, & it’s why the market only works for investors having long-term focus. Performance is never linear, up and to the right, year after year. You sometimes have to hold a position for few years before it goes up 100% in 3 months.
1187 2018-01-14 06:17:34 I have noticed a correlation between "green days" for #marijuana & red days for energy sector on the #tsx of late and vice versa.  I wonder if speculators are playing both sides,  Anyways, really embarrassing for  & #tsx.  
Doomsday soon for pot stocks undoubtedly imo.
1188 2018-01-14 06:16:00 In addition bro was giving out stocks in his company to his parents charity for early childhood development before amazon was even big. Stock that's gone up almost 2000% since then

1194 2018-01-14 06:03:30 I don’t recall Obama ever doing anything positive for the economy when he was in so what would be taking affect at this point?
Also the Democrats said the stocks would tank if Trump were elected  They have been overdue for a correction for some time now.
1195 2018-01-14 06:03:28 Pro tip: get a dog, they will always love you & they won’t ignore you for more than 3 seconds bc then they miss you

1197 2018-01-14 06:01:18 I don't personally chase stocks up (pullback included) all that does is elevate risk for what you describe. I've been in $AGY a long time did all my buying early, now have the ability to de-risk along the way. It's a long way back down to my buy price so risk has been mitigated.
1198 2018-01-14 05:57:03 The economy  started upward before Trump or even if Clinton would have taken office... it takes more than a year to turn.. yes stocks are crazy. Waiting for a crash

1200 2018-01-14 05:51:29 Yeah definitely! I get this. Buy the pullbacks on strong performing stocks. Manage them up. Everybody has a differing method. What if it crashes through a key support line though and becomes a down trending stock? What then?
1201 2018-01-14 05:50:06 Do something to create more volume and money to mobile to get my stocks up with mobile. Been at 60-70 dollars for the longest....
1202 2018-01-14 05:48:47 Let me know.  My biggest winners have come from large caps stocks, many featured in the IBD 20.

1204 2018-01-14 05:47:09 These 4 Imprudent SC Judges brought their own status down thru indulging in unwarranted Adventurism n made Laughing-stocks of themselves, did immeasurable Harms to d Credibility of our Judiciary. Constitutional Authorities should not behave in such Irresponsible/Ludicrous Manner.
1205 2018-01-14 05:45:02 I'm not an economist but stocks went from 8000 to 19000 under Obama, = 11,000. More to the point, I'm not criticizing every aspect of Trump's handling of the economy, but it doesn't make him a stable genius. On balance he is doing much more harm than good in America and abroad.
1206 2018-01-14 05:45:00 Is large cap - stocks or indices or funds limited only to top 50 cos?
1207 2018-01-14 05:44:56 Great. No bump stocks and NO GUNS!! You psychos.
1208 2018-01-14 05:43:15 HELLO!
about 109MD,
There was also online sale, but there were many out-of-stocks. Currently the sale is ended.
1209 2018-01-14 05:38:33 Yes, that is so true of repukes- they no longer care about anything but their own needs.They only care about is their stocks and their bank accounts! Selfish, greedy AH’s! Integrity,morals and truth no longer matters. Buh bye GOP - you won’t be winning for much longer.
1210 2018-01-14 05:37:15 It doesn't speak about diversification outside stocks.

1212 2018-01-14 05:36:06 You can not grasp that the majority of the people of this country can not afford to buy stocks yet that’s all we hear. Sure you in the 1% are making easy money. But you screwed Americans to do that.  Republican facts are often wrong or factors left out. the true Fake news!
1213 2018-01-14 05:34:18 15 days frozen crypto = 3 months frozen stocks
1214 2018-01-14 05:33:23 Real estate, LT stocks, kid educational funding, car funding, pension fund, or simply put into savings. tons of things to invest.
1215 2018-01-14 05:31:59 Happiness is knowing that there are unlimited stocks of foods stored inside your refrigerator.

1216 2018-01-14 05:31:27 This is crypto. Not stocks.
1217 2018-01-14 05:27:25 7th at Singles and 3rd in doubles at @LAN_Hero! Also took 5 stocks in a cree Battle against Australia! Thank you so much for Everything!
1218 2018-01-14 05:27:13 Because USD is a depreciating currency, hence earns negative returns, and stocks/bonds are investments which earn positive returns. Portfolios mostly want investment classes, not asset classes, hence why they don't buy Picassos and Lambos.
1219 2018-01-14 05:26:28 Hi Aishah. The box sets are available while stocks last 
1220 2018-01-14 05:25:54 ya but my blanket stocks are soaring
1221 2018-01-14 05:25:52 Do you have the sector wise segregation of stocks vish?? I remember you posting that in Yahoo group.
1222 2018-01-14 05:25:41 It didn’t create any value. Investors shifted out of cash or bonds or some other instrument into stocks. Net financial assets stayed the same.

1226 2018-01-14 05:22:56 I wanna ask a serious question:

How many of you who have some form of cryptocurrency also have gold, real estate, stocks, etc?
1227 2018-01-14 05:22:52 Percentages are misleading... 8 years of Obama stocks gained only 7,000 points.  This includes 1,000 point gain since Nov 7, 2016. Trump 1st year gain 5,100.
1228 2018-01-14 05:21:56 How many stocks/investments do you have? Whats in your portfolio?
1229 2018-01-14 05:19:25 Prediction for 2018: Infra stocks will give the highest percentage returns.
Reasons:
1. Sector rotation
2. Order book will begin to materialize into EPS for select players (road infra)
3. About 5-8 yrs of growth will be discounted
1230 2018-01-14 05:17:28 real state can bring cash cashflow but when you talk long term stocks there purpose is to create long term wealth not regular cashflow that's the distinction.
1231 2018-01-14 05:16:40 they revert to old prints. Having infovidual stocks blow through your stops is diff than a circuit breaker trigger.  But yeah, believe me I am all about the real paper. Print my trades each and every time.
1232 2018-01-14 05:16:29 Yes I agree that the stock market going up is great for people who own stocks however for the vast majority who don't we've got to figure out a way to help them. In addition we need our president to focus on help 4 the people in Puerto Rico NOW
1233 2018-01-14 05:15:49 I'd strongly advise getting out of coal stocks as they are soon to be destroyed. Most oil cos will go to zero in time but the timing is tough to call, and some companies are innovating-- Shell, for example, bought into ev charging and is setting up for the future.
1234 2018-01-14 05:15:07 Jan 14, 2018...in process of getting my market
thoughts together.   1st...suggest, NO NEW BUYING,
of SP500 index, or assocated stocks.  We are at
a pivot time of defining an SP500 top.

1238 2018-01-14 05:11:46 I disagree. See the returns of large caps in 1 year :-
Maruti Suzuki - 71%
RIL 85%
Ultra Tech 33%

Small and mid caps returns have been 100% +
Quess corp, Endurance technique to name a few.
If i hold these stocks for another 2-3 years i will get another 100% returns

1242 2018-01-14 05:09:15 Last but not least, the 3.7% yield Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) currently offers doesn’t necessarily put it in the top echelon of dividend stocks, but what it lacks in income-producing potential it balances out with lots of growth potential.
1243 2018-01-14 05:09:03 If you don’t take the lump sum because your afraid you’ll spend it all, then you don’t deserve it lol. Take the lump sum, invest in stocks and crypto, and never take advice from wagecucks.

1245 2018-01-14 05:08:41 No doubt you’re thrilled, being among the wealthy who will reap the benefits.  Half the people in this country do not own stocks.  These are the people Trump promised to help.  Instead, he panders to the rich.  Lots of layoffs not mentioned.

I don’t understand fully.

1265 2018-01-14 04:47:00 The BULL MARKET in stocks is 103 months old

The Conservative Businessman TRUMP is only responsible for 11 of them

The Liberal OBAMA started the BULL MARKET

Before the election TRUMP warned of a BIG, FAT, UGLY BUBBLE

IS HE RIGHT ABOUT THAT?  WHEN?  CRASH SOON?

1267 2018-01-14 04:46:28 It takes way too much to deal with multiple people at a time. I’m tryna keep investing and building into the same woman. I’m too valuable to myself deposit here and there. Stocks aren’t the only that increases in value over time.
1268 2018-01-14 04:46:16 Bubbles are typically related to overpriced assets.  Negative earning tech stocks in 2001, inflated housing prices due to slack lending restrictions in 2008.  Which assets are inflated now?  I don't see outrageous P/E ratios in equity market.  Please explain.

1273 2018-01-14 04:43:51 That’s good news for you and your multimillionaire friends @realDonaldTrump and @LouDobbs. All the other people working minimum wage aren’t making a killing on their stocks and investments.
1274 2018-01-14 04:43:49 Economy up, Regulations way down. 2.5 million new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.0%. Biz, stocks, manufacturing way up- record levels! America safer; we have great respect around the world. Making friends and allies, exposing enemies. Most of all people and God first in USA!
1275 2018-01-14 04:42:58 Traders selling $wtc after the spike for profit taking,  whales accumulating more and more $wtc at this price. Traders make money,  whales make money,  sheep's lose.

1282 2018-01-14 04:38:07 Fast Stock Market growth is NOT an indicator of a strong economy.  It took 17 yrs for tech stocks to recover trillions from the dot-com crash (Think Qualcomm)The market high in 2006 dropped 22% in 8 days in 2007 crushing the middle class. Stocks are overvalued now(think Amazon)!
1283 2018-01-14 04:38:00 I guess same with stocks.
1284 2018-01-14 04:37:44 Eric Eric Eric, we know don jr got all the looks and brains but I gotta tell you, ur dumb and ugly and my dad didn't give me any stocks
1285 2018-01-14 04:37:21 You are wrong.  I have and many of my friends have become millionaires just doing simple basic investing in blue chip stocks. Nothing fancy just using the power of compounding.
1286 2018-01-14 04:34:30 The stock market is not an indicator for the economy. 80% of stocks are owned by only 10% of the population. It’s an indicator for how well the rich are doing. Gdp is the indicator . It’s down a full point, but projected to rise later this year
1287 2018-01-14 04:34:08 Ppl need to realize and stop giving validity to their arguments!With them It's never been about gun rts(especially with minorities access),Nat Debt(rem Grover Northkwist pledge),patriotism(rem rage against Obama's lack of flag pen but now Trump+TREASON)or stocks, it's about HATE!

1290 2018-01-14 04:32:54 Watching  "Wardogs".  Can't beat 'em, join 'em, everyone should just buy stocks in defense to solve their money problems. Like the rich do.

1296 2018-01-14 04:28:43 Or how 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10%. The other 20% is owned by about 42% of Americans. The other 48% don't own any stock. Money in stocks doesn't equal money in the economy. Stocks don't create jobs. Actually cutting labor benefits stock holders better but maga.

Most of your picks have proven to be multibaggers in short span of time

I am really very thankful to you

Looking forward for more
1305 2018-01-14 04:18:39 My takeaway is not to do research on stocks at 1 point in time in history. Especially not in a euphoric market before a crash...
1306 2018-01-14 04:17:28 Every US citizens should invest in stocks right now LoU is right this is a Melt$up phase and this is going up even Trump call this bull market. Pensions and 401 should invest heavily hurry or you will lose money.

1310 2018-01-14 04:14:33 You know that ½ of Americans don’t own stocks. That the stock market bubble is only benefitting a tiny percentage of wealthiest Americans. And the fact based media covers Every Single Market record. Get a new schtick. #sad
1311 2018-01-14 04:13:41 Yet, STILL MOST Americans can NOT afford to buy stocks and don't have 401ks.  So, it DOES NOT MATTER to them. @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump
1312 2018-01-14 04:12:36 Unemployment is leftover from the Obama era rules still in effect, @potus ain't done nothing to affect it. Same goes for stocks, other than fact that more rich people investing now that their rich friend in office watching their back. #FakeNews
1313 2018-01-14 04:12:14 Guess what only 48% of Americans even own stock.  Most of the stocks are owned by the 1%.  So stop bragging about how high it is.  Plus when it crashes you and Daddy won't take responsibility for that, will ya, dummy?
1314 2018-01-14 04:11:52 I can't imagine having that much input into their careers. Very interesting. I like the fandom stocks represented by 1 entity, actually. This was very different from my normal threads; thank you for that! You pushed me to think in a direction I don't normally, and it was fun. thx
1315 2018-01-14 04:10:47 More than 40% of Americans own stocks, they definitely “ALL” benefit from recent bull markets, not to mention the extra & hidden benefits through 401k, IRA and much higher equity for overall corporate America to hire, invest.
1316 2018-01-14 04:10:38 I’m not knowledgeable in stocks but how it would be like amongst the factions of ARMYs (K vs C vs Jpn vs etc) if they bought separately instead together as 1 entity? Could we still consider it a success for all of ARMY or could it dictate a chain of command & lead to a divide?
1317 2018-01-14 04:07:59 how many stocks u will have and what time are u going to start selling!
1318 2018-01-14 04:06:29 The only problem with such stock market growth is that 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10% while the other 20% is owned by 42% of Americans. So wealth inequality continues under Trump. The wealthy did quite well under Obama and are doing even better under Trump.
1319 2018-01-14 04:04:28 "I was watching ESPN today and all 5 analyists, experts they call themselves, picked the #Falcons  to win. I'm glad they're not in charge of my finances by any means, picking stocks here and there. If they're going to call us underdogs again next week I'm fine with it" -Zach Ertz
1320 2018-01-14 04:02:46 Then why did stocks climb the morning after election and drop when fake news CNN claimed Trump was being indicted and then recover when it proved to be false. It's called consumer confidence.
1321 2018-01-14 04:02:19 #AllThanksToTrump for shooting down the Ballistic Missile with his golf ball and singlehandedly shielded the stocks market from Great Depression and annihilated every single dignity that's left for the citizen of S***hole countries.

1324 2018-01-14 03:57:27 Btw, ATT is laying off 30,000. Walmart closing Sam 60+ stores. less than 1/2 of Americans have access to the stock market, & the Dow is only 30 stocks. the important number is permanent wage growth - so far - one time payments to people they will layoff soon, so it’s severance.
1325 2018-01-14 03:54:56 Bhai what u do of snake oil?
1326 2018-01-14 03:54:09 Nothing to do with trump. Stocks are up because cheap to buy. The $ has been losing value against major currencies.
1327 2018-01-14 03:53:32 True. Also fandom entitlement. You might look into it to see how they structured the fan purchasing of stocks though. Maybe BH could alter some of the contractual framework to make it less controllable by fans.
1328 2018-01-14 03:52:26 Um, this means nothing to 1/2 of Americans who don't own any stocks because the can't afford it.
1329 2018-01-14 03:52:10 Sirji jiyo, kya baat hai,
1330 2018-01-14 03:50:47 Is the #IVRank derived based on historical IV of that particular stock or do u just concentrate on the current series IV of all stocks and select those that matches ur rules?

1334 2018-01-14 03:48:45 Hey, Lou-- Only half of Americans own stocks, so the rising market means NOTHING to them. Especially the 11 THOUSAND Sam's Club workers who got laid off with minutes' notice yesterday. #ShitholePresident

1342 2018-01-14 03:46:20 .@realDonaldTrump 81% of all stocks are owned by the top 10% in our country. This does not help anyone else!!!
1343 2018-01-14 03:46:02 Deregulation and permanent tax cuts are great for business but horrible for the average American, who is footing the bill with their money and their health and can't afford stocks.
1344 2018-01-14 03:45:57 Doesn’t matter if the world governments response is print money and buy said stocks.
1345 2018-01-14 03:45:52 $1.3 trillion tax cut, deregulation allowing ravaging the environment, decreasing consumer protection, deregulating banks, screwing college students, are all good for business.  Stocks and profits are booming.  Big gains for the rich, much, much smaller benefit for 90%.
1346 2018-01-14 03:45:17 So basically you are mad because you are too stupid to handle stocks correctly and to poor to have someone else do it for you.

1351 2018-01-14 03:43:40 The fact that you have stocks doesn't make the 84/10 statistic not true, but obviously you don't do a lot of critical thinking. Looking at the world through a tiny selfish pinhole is how you gullible racists keep believing the lies Trump sells you.

1360 2018-01-14 03:37:34 The economy was healthy when you inherited it. Of course stocks are up; your Wall St. pals know you’re working on their behalf, not ours. Would you like to address the  average wages and purchasing power of the working class, including the poor folks who voted for you?
1361 2018-01-14 03:36:43 The economy has steadily been growing since 2010 and Trumps rejection of the Asian trade agreement simply means that Asian countries will simply bypass us and leave us behind. I should also caution against holding hope in stocks as they tend to correct themselves
1362 2018-01-14 03:36:36 It's bullshit that only 50% of people can afford stocks. One trip to the library reading about asset allocation can help someone diversify a 401K. Stop making excuses for people and get in the game

1385 2018-01-14 03:13:39 So that guy who used to work for you dumped over $24 million in stocks w/ insider info about that security flaw. Didn’t people used to go to jail for things like that?
1386 2018-01-14 03:11:14 Javier, lives on Mahogany Drive with 2 hermit crabs.

Put all their savings into mustard stocks. Can't retire.
1387 2018-01-14 03:09:32 Fuck these stocks i’m tryna make a hit
1388 2018-01-14 03:08:35 Its always a good feeling to see the money you invested in stocks go up
1389 2018-01-14 03:05:37 Uhhh... I think you ignored where 2008-2009. Was that a “crash” or a mere blip? There are actually 4 dips during 44’s 8 yrs. Any sense why? Oil prices. I’m happy to go toe to toe w you on energy market & stocks. Fair warning: it’s my wheelhouse.
1390 2018-01-14 03:04:42 Contrary to what most people think, I think the Chinese stock market will move up sharply!Now is a good time to invest in Chinese stocks.
1391 2018-01-14 03:02:20 Sorry, the only laughing stocks are those on the left. And Americans continue to do well without the complaints of the left.
1392 2018-01-14 03:01:11 Every Tom, Dick and Harry would have made money by buying into stocks in last 3 years.. ,

Corrections are inevitable..
1393 2018-01-14 03:00:56 Na I know I read he sold like 100 stocks of the network to fund it...were just patiently waiting at this point lmfaoo
1394 2018-01-14 03:00:26 If stocks melt, FX will be the release valve.  CB's will be fine ultimately bc that's why they hold gold (& probably why global CB's have bought 2x more gold than UST's since 2013.)
1395 2018-01-14 03:00:02 Sell Stocks!
1396 2018-01-14 02:56:21 Hence the problem! CBs assets are increasingly subject to mkt risk so there is a huge wrong way risk in play here (especially those with massive stock exposure: BOJ and SNB). CBs = synthetic bet on stocks and if stocks melt, they will get hit on two fronts: asset prices + fx
1397 2018-01-14 02:54:49 As The World Turns  stocks up  jobs up gdp up consumer confidence up wages up  stupid discussions on tv are to be ignored  listen to music

1400 2018-01-14 02:47:22 Hey Blockchain Stocks thanks for the follow!
1401 2018-01-14 02:44:25 US financial figures lag 1 year behind actual figures. So every single growth that has been seen in the USA figures for GDP and stocks since trump took office are as a result of Obama's policy. Not Trump.
1402 2018-01-14 02:44:22 In this caper you follow the money stocks oil and dead bodies. Everybody has stock. Trump has stock in Keystone also has stock in Tomahawk missiles used in Syria. I figured Turtle's wife was involved. She was doing illegal stuff b4 her Cabinet appt.& is continuing.
1403 2018-01-14 02:41:52 "about 14 percent of U.S. families directly own stocks, an asset class dominated by the country's top earners, according to the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, the president has also rolled back efforts to expand retirement savings options to more middle-class & low-income workers."
1404 2018-01-14 02:40:27 The economy cannot be 'changed' in less than ONE year! The stocks have been a BULL market for 9 years! You are giving trump too much credit and completely negating Obama's role in light of what Bush left! Please, FOX, for just once, tell the truth!
1405 2018-01-14 02:39:56 I don’t think I understand a BD’s “hold” recommendation. If risk / return is sub par, why wouldn’t I pick from any of the other stocks on the buy list? Surely plenty with similar exposure profiles (probably all highly correlated anyway...).
1406 2018-01-14 02:37:13 I love to hear people who know nothing about stocks talk about stocks.. #yalldumb
1407 2018-01-14 02:35:52 The investment in stocks now is a giant bubble, waiting to burst. The reason; cronies are gambling on the Obama Wave, Trump will burst this bubble, as all other Republican Presidencies. As soon as Mueller gets Trump in a hearing, it'll tank.
1408 2018-01-14 02:35:48 If you have a 401k you probably own stocks too.  Unions fought these opportunities out of fear of losing old school pension plans.
employer paid health insurance factors into this matter more than most realize, and we were definitely lied to about that.
1409 2018-01-14 02:35:20 If u don't see this future money in the stock market and u ain't investing in certain stocks rn that are less than a penny a share, then you're a ree ree. #CallingItNow ERBB
1410 2018-01-14 02:34:43 You want to do stocks?

1414 2018-01-14 02:31:11 We wanted jobs. That's better. Stocks up. 401k good. ISIS all but gone. Better trade, tax break. You call that poison if you want to. You are right about one thing. We have been waiting on a president to do those things and we aren't even close to changing our minds. Continue.
1415 2018-01-14 02:26:48 Almost if not Evert time Obama spoke the Stocks lost....

1417 2018-01-14 02:25:41 But, if US Govt has to meet its obligations on social security and mediclaim, stocks have to go a lot higher from here. The real #Bubble is in bonds. Bumpy road ahead?
1418 2018-01-14 02:25:05 Unless you have stocks who cares about the stock market, it is not an indicator of our economy. Btw, job creation is low, people lost healthcare, companies got a major tax break and are laying off people, the middle class is screwed,our allies hate us etc etc. So much winning.

1424 2018-01-14 02:19:35 My best-case-scenario life is to become the CEO of a company at 40, sell my stocks, retire, move to Europe, buy a farm and start a dog foster home

1426 2018-01-14 02:17:17 Yes. A controlling share of stocks does not control make... bleep bloop this makes logical sense.
1427 2018-01-14 02:16:03 You just manipulated the market by excluding a chunk of the global average. Idiots. If this sort of tactics surrounded traditional stocks, you'd be in jail.

1441 2018-01-14 02:01:40 Since 2007 we had $1.6 trillion go into bonds & $300billion in Stock mutual funds/ETF outflows. I think the risk is that money leaves bonds eventually & goes into stocks at some point when Euphoria enters into the equation. You might get a correction 1st, but not bear market yet

1443 2018-01-14 01:59:13 Jane could answer this better but my understanding is pediatricians are required to keep two separate stocks because the state pays for the vaccines given to Medicaid patients. It allows Medicaid to get a lower price and provide more vaccines within their existing budget.

1450 2018-01-14 01:49:20 the "trump" stock market is good for those who own stocks; tho i suspect most of these suffering job losses from Carrier and Sam's Clubs are not in the markets. that said, the extreme low unemployment rate should be good for their job prospects, more so than at Bush recession.

1460 2018-01-14 01:35:50 Some things are 'elevated', but that is a 'relative' matter. Many things are still outright cheap, with proven earnings, not least $MU $BAC $INTC $CSCO $AAPL the list could go on for some 200-300 stocks just to begin with.

1482 2018-01-14 01:18:28 We are in the 1920s but without any true valuation in markets, stocks, oil, gold, fiat currency. All of our economy is based on debt (a hedge on future production) and false valuations of every economic building block.
1483 2018-01-14 01:16:17 Yeah, but stocks are separate from government GDP forecasts which internal reports have down to 1.7% or something like that.

Not everyone owns stock and I haven't  seen any new businesses recently.   
Get off the computer,  listen to what 
people really need and maybe all the upper income people should be paying more taxes. Their stocks have risen so they can afford it

1495 2018-01-14 01:01:38 No they are facts because they are describing known information. 10's of thousands of layoffs are happening in January, most Americans don't own stocks and no economist on the planet thinks the stock market is an indicator of economic strength. You can verify them if you want.

Soros, who openly admitted in video interviews he's currently attempting to overthrow the US & several other countries. What do you think the 10 million in stocks was? A gift?
1507 2018-01-14 00:48:38 Yeah. To me, it's not a big deal, most of the 2A community disagree with me on that. But the bill would need to say bump stocks, not "rate increasing" devices. That quote is where the big problems start. I'm all for the common sense shit.
1508 2018-01-14 00:46:47 Cool, glad we agree that bump stocks should be outlawed. Let’s start there.

1514 2018-01-14 00:40:41 Many stocks look like $THC trying to reclaim 200 dma. Check out $LMAT, $BRKS, $KEM, or breaking out like $ACM, $MTOR
1515 2018-01-14 00:40:05 Ride the stocks and wait for #blackswan
1516 2018-01-14 00:38:28 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% of people. It is a false economic indicator. Rich people are getting much richer under trump. The rest of us aren’t.
1517 2018-01-14 00:38:21 definitely trying to learn how stocks work
1518 2018-01-14 00:37:02 Nothing new in there for you! But I didn't realize you were adverse to mining stocks.  Buy some USAU and let it ride for awhile.  Undervalued intrinsically vs its copper/gold project.  Huge upside potential w/its Cortez Trend gold property.
1519 2018-01-14 00:36:54 Have a day off Stocks. 280 characters really isn’t enough for me to give you a scathing attack. Until next time.
1520 2018-01-14 00:36:10 Stocks are literally the only things that consumers refuse to buy when they’re at their cheapest and only want to buy when they’re at their most expensive.
1521 2018-01-14 00:35:51 Well who's fault is that not owning stocks.  Anyone can, if you're so inclined!  So easy to do.  Just sign up through any e-broker and get started!

Let's see ......
1524 2018-01-14 00:34:16 It’s actually not that crazy that people think you can only buy BTC in denominations of 1. That’s how stocks work.
1525 2018-01-14 00:33:35 stocks is for boys clout is for men
1526 2018-01-14 00:33:14 I don’t think you understand how the Stock Market works. Stocks going up usually means jobs are being cut and always means owners are getting rich. Usually doesn’t mean much for the rest of us.
1527 2018-01-14 00:32:58 If you pick flowers that like cooler climates you could do well. Alyssum for sure, calendula, clarkia, stocks (which smell heavenly!) are some to think about.
1528 2018-01-14 00:32:55 Can't wait for the combine this year for the receiver group. 40, vertical, survive the ground drill, etc. Draft stocks could fall way off if survival of the ground ain't there
1529 2018-01-14 00:29:59 @DNC bump stocks improve stability and accuracy not rate of fire
1530 2018-01-14 00:29:40 @FoxNews bump stocks do make guns like machine gun. Banning them fine. BUT, a belt will accomplish same thing. Should we ban belts? #MAGA
1531 2018-01-14 00:29:00 Stocks are still good. Oops
1532 2018-01-14 00:28:44 Yeah I have all missions done except for the stocks one. So I’m not too bother if I finish either xD
1533 2018-01-14 00:28:18 stocks can be bought and sold on the stock exchange for something that is still illegal. Government hypocrisy knows no bounds. As long as they get a piece it is ok
1534 2018-01-14 00:26:34 According to the NFL catch rule, it's incomplete because the receiver did not invest the ball in bonds or equitable stocks with a steady and secure return and high potential for future gains...

...while going to the ground.
1535 2018-01-14 00:26:04 Anyone into crypto/stocks hml
1536 2018-01-14 00:25:39 Surely a no catch #NFLPlayoffs 
1537 2018-01-14 00:23:06 @AnalystRatingsNetwork bidask is like your grandma that knows nothing about stocks posts her opinion on a Stock...
1538 2018-01-14 00:19:15 I like your new plan with Telus and ZCL Composites as I own and like them. Those are the only stocks I know about. I would like to research and get to know the others better. I really like that your diversifying further I think you will benefit in the long run.
1539 2018-01-14 00:18:49 @NRSC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @HouseFloor @SenateFloor @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Republicans obstruct a true investigation, refuse to protect elections, bump stocks still sold, and they took MILLIONS in oligarch tied Russian $. END CORRUPTION IN GOVT, ELECT DEMS 2018 #ShitholeGOP
1540 2018-01-14 00:18:10 So that guy who used to work for you dumped over $24 million in stocks w/ insider info about that security flaw. Didn’t people used to go to jail for things like that?
1541 2018-01-14 00:16:48 Knowledge is power and it takes a certain knack and guts to trade OTC stocks and talent and a little luck sometimes ..
1542 2018-01-14 00:16:40 Too bad we have so many clueless people wanting to resist. I am better off in 1 year with Trump. Economy, stocks and security. Look what the military did to ISIS in the last year. Obama made it worse everyday he pretended to be a leader.
1543 2018-01-14 00:16:07 I keep wishing I had an extra 10 to 20k for my TFSA right know so I can buy more stocks 
1544 2018-01-14 00:15:14 What a $h!t hole
1545 2018-01-14 00:15:12 Hi Prashant, I thank you for nice work. 
How do you shortlist or select stocks for options and how do you decide which strategy to apply.  I didn't make it for live session. Can we have recorded session. Thanks once again
#vohiAMA
1546 2018-01-14 00:14:56 When Trump was elected, I moved all stocks to US companies, refinanced to fixed rate mortgage, and bought an investment property within 6months.  I would have never done that if Hillary were elected.
1547 2018-01-14 00:14:03 Keep pushing forward!
1548 2018-01-14 00:13:51 Yeh I know but if you buy stocks then kill them then sell them then buy other stocks then sell them you get a shit ton of money but I wasted a fucking hour of my life on it only for stocks to plummet and not get a damn penny
1549 2018-01-14 00:13:08 You screwed Haiti
1550 2018-01-14 00:12:44 Man, trading crypto is a 24/7 thing, unlike 6:30AM-1PM five days a week for stocks.
1551 2018-01-14 00:12:09 Stocks.
1552 2018-01-14 00:10:32 I fucking killed that guy in the car park and the stocks went down before I could sell so have to do it all again now cant be fucking arsed
1553 2018-01-14 00:09:54 Outstanding! Will seek that out. Who stocks it in the Nth Dublin area (Malahide/Portmarnock/Swords)?
1554 2018-01-14 00:09:32 I may be old school, but I do know of real "Whales".  Those who put 10s of thousands of dollars into penny stocks, but I'm completely ignorant of "Bots", heard the term, but unfamiliar
1555 2018-01-14 00:08:24 What is wrong with you?  Ever heard of Lightning network and Segwit? Who in their right mind buys bitcoin with a credit card ... ever hear anyone buying stocks or other tradable assets via credit cards?? Unbelievable that people post this kind of crap without doing their homework
1556 2018-01-14 00:08:07 Dr.ty crew wins with 5 stocks left
1557 2018-01-14 00:07:01 Waiting For More Packages Of @ouicoin Want To Invest More. Play Hard Or Go Home. More Risk More Successful. New Bitcoin Is On Way To Success Soon In Stocks Then We Will Write New History. IN SHA ALLAH @ouicoin @ZakaWaqar
1558 2018-01-14 00:05:44 This obviously shows stocks recovering from the recession and plateauing in 2015-2016. Then trump takes office and the stocks begin to ride again.
1559 2018-01-14 00:05:19 Ok stocks
1560 2018-01-14 00:04:19 I truly have nothing against Oprah. She has a wonderful life. I don't think she's gonna give it all up 2 b POTUS. Trump did it because he truly loves  Am. and was seeing it's downfall. Look at the last year. Libs can not lie & say things r not better w/ jobs, stocks energy, etc.
1561 2018-01-14 00:03:48 All boats. Except the majority of Americans who own 0 stocks. Google is easy “percentage of Americans who own stock.” Try being less hateful and more informed.
1562 2018-01-14 00:03:23 On the other hand.....I made a fortune in Laundry Detergent and Underwear stocks today.
1563 2018-01-14 00:01:27 I'm up to that bit my friend has told me to buy and sell stocks to get more money but it takes fucking ages not worth the hassle 
1564 2018-01-14 00:00:43 Reckon there's any chance of bringing back "village square stocks" as were used in the "olden" days?  I'm not a sadist, understand. I'd just love to see that.  Even if it were only for a year or two.

Bio fuels and some strong correlations to crude rather than stocks to use.

1577 2018-01-13 23:46:13 Agreed, it is apples and oranges. But I would say stocks are in a speculative bubble since valuations are based on the fed's continued support and keeping monetary policies. Doesn't mean it cant keep going for a long time.

1605 2018-01-13 23:34:59 Someones stocks going SOUTH
1606 2018-01-13 23:34:10 Gold and of course cash. However many correlations are out the window since 2007-2009 meltdown e.g. 4.1% unemployment but 10 yr barely 2.6% even though stocks on a tear bonds still popular.
1607 2018-01-13 23:34:00 Ohhh ... I need to buy stocks in salt !! ... it’s now quickly becoming a topic commodity 
1608 2018-01-13 23:33:15 From Just Sayin Dept.:

In Aug 2015 & Jan ‘16, 26% of the stocks in the S&P 500 were hitting 52 wk lows (=good capitulation buy points)

Today we have 32% of the S&P 500 hitting 52 week highs(=good sell point?)

Fear & Greed are two very distinct, different Market emotions

1610 2018-01-13 23:30:40 The precedent set by this presidency has the world reeling. American has set the tone since 44 and this mudbutt relinquished our leadership and authority in 1 year. Laughing stocks that can't even admit than our president aided RU. as they attacked our sovereignty.
1611 2018-01-13 23:29:44 So irresponsible of CNBC to focus on this.  Give it more attention then it deserves- would they focus on .00001 stocks ? Same risk/reward

1613 2018-01-13 23:29:07 @Acumulate no. the kids are using crypto returns and throwing some into gme thinking stocks trade like btc.

1616 2018-01-13 23:28:16 @Wooltops  - stocks are low be will be stocking up in the next few weeks.  Satisfaction guaranteed - lovely yarn, #British Merino (and others), spun in the UK
1617 2018-01-13 23:27:54 I just bought my first stocks the other day and I’m proud of myself
1618 2018-01-13 23:27:48 You are not losing a single cent until you sell!! LTHODL. Don’t get into crypto expecting to get rich in a week. This project can be compred to buying Apple stocks on day 1 it was released. Have patience. Learn about the asian market and what is being build there with this! 
1619 2018-01-13 23:26:26 It annoys me that Govt are still supporting, through tax concessions, what is essentially an investment just like shares, stocks & bonds. 
If everyone got compensated when their shares went into the negative, the country would be bankrupt.
1620 2018-01-13 23:25:48 I would but im tryna think long term. Gonna meet up with a friend of mine on trading stocks lol I'll just help promote my wifes
1621 2018-01-13 23:25:04 should i buy since mine masternim belum shipped 
1622 2018-01-13 23:24:38 True that, that's why now I am currently studying stock trading. Some of this stocks can increase 50%, 100% 200% in a day - Not missing out now but preparing myself. 
My bitcoin experience taught me something.
1623 2018-01-13 23:22:28 Crypto is dead exit all markets into penny stocks
1624 2018-01-13 23:20:04 And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you soup and stocks know how I feel
1625 2018-01-13 23:18:33 @MiamiTrader also notice the copy and pasted signature under both posts " feel free to DM me questions on mid-cap stocks or which broker to use minimum 3 K 20 X leverage no PDT"
1626 2018-01-13 23:17:51 That's great, am glad for you. Also, just to be clear, I have a lot in my former 401k (I retired and converted it into other investments, still with a portion in stocks). I am very happy with the market increases. But I do know there are those who have no money in the market.
1627 2018-01-13 23:16:02 IQE has a Slater calculated PEG if 0.9 so nowhere near as overpriced as some of the other growth stocks folks are piling into.

1632 2018-01-13 23:11:58 The point isn't the sweatshirt, sir. It is the dismissal that happens whenever Black ppl speak out. If they we're to respond with hashtags or articles they would be dismissed for that too. People literally just want Black ppl to be there laughing stocks, and we won't be
1633 2018-01-13 23:11:13 Being a value investor, bitcoin and blockchain will not be something I look out for. Once again, like dot-com stocks, most of them will never survive. Impossible at this point to know who those few will be.

1636 2018-01-13 23:09:17 Great minds think alike lol.
1637 2018-01-13 23:07:49 Trump said Obama’s low unemployment rate was a sham. Now y’all embrace it. Obama never touted the stock market gains too much because 80% of the value is owned by 10% of Americans, but y’all embracing that too. Oh, plus 30% of current stocks are owned by foreign investors.
1638 2018-01-13 23:05:50 One question. Will ngc will be base currency for your trading plate form? Like to do trading other coins need to buy naga coin first  to buy stocks ??
1639 2018-01-13 23:03:07 Never traded stocks and I'm new to TA so any new info is appreciated and absorbed. 
1640 2018-01-13 23:02:41 I made a fortune on internet stocks in the dot com era. This is just the same. People told me the internet was a scam. Amazon would never turn a profit. AOL was worth nothing. KIN feels like the same sort of thing. I’m happy. If you want to make money, ask someone with money.
1641 2018-01-13 23:01:00 Put em in the stocks, says I!
1642 2018-01-13 22:58:54 Is there a portfolio of 52 stocks that will get dividends every week of the year? Some of them bound to be rubbish though..
1643 2018-01-13 22:58:32 That was until fat cats learned of the tax scam and they were goung to save billions why think stocks keep rising? They are buying more
1644 2018-01-13 22:58:18 What does the astute Ms. Curtis have to say about her retirement accounts, investments and stocks going up? If Trump is an idiot I'll take him hands down and pass on snowflake meltdowns from Curtis.
1645 2018-01-13 22:57:37 These four Supreme Court judges became laughing stocks. All of them lost respect and credibility. They proved that they are merely puppets of corrupt/ crook congress and leftists

1648 2018-01-13 22:55:17 Tonight starts my testing in the street stocks for @teambeastracing. Hoping for big things this year with the team. Last year saw very limited race time this year i plan to be a top contender! @iRacing
1649 2018-01-13 22:54:36 I wonder how much Tide’s stocks went up for that dumbass trend
1650 2018-01-13 22:52:54 $GRAT might be on the list as well IMO
1651 2018-01-13 22:52:52 Time to invest in Exposure stocks
1652 2018-01-13 22:52:25 Nah. Yields would have gone much lower. Bullish for stocks. I wish I was kidding
1653 2018-01-13 22:52:07 @timothysykes So are algorithms being used in penny stocks?
1654 2018-01-13 22:51:49 Really depends on what intrigues you. Currently learning about stocks, markets etc so I found it very interesting
1655 2018-01-13 22:51:34 Haha, the only people that are "losing" money are the people that SELL their stocks at a loss.  I still can't believe how many people don't understand this extremely simple concept.
1656 2018-01-13 22:51:12 Finally after loosing money under Obama. I am shocked everyday as my stocks rise on real money not fake. Hopefully these people will stop whining because they actually have to go back to work.
1657 2018-01-13 22:50:45 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10 % of Americans. This has no weigh with the day to day lives of the average American.
1658 2018-01-13 22:49:24 When people start dumping bonds to buy stocks, that'll probably be a decent selling opp IMO.
1659 2018-01-13 22:48:17 Buh hahahahaha. The same people that said if he were elected stocks would tank. Gotta love liberals. They can’t even decide what sex they are not alone have any knowledge of econ101

1661 2018-01-13 22:45:50 If there's a deficit then there is typically a plan to pay it off over a period of time and agreed with @TPRgovuk .... Tata perhaps set a precedent given Afaik that was a first.
1662 2018-01-13 22:43:42 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10 % of Americans. This has no weigh with the day to day lives of the average American.

(By the way, Obama had doubled the market and the recession recovery was at its peak when he left office.)
1663 2018-01-13 22:43:15 Just finished scanning potential chart setups @CloudzOTCCharts and @CloudzCDNCharts. Have a look. Its Free!!!!!!. But, now I need a beer and coffee before I begin the whole process with the Nasdaq and NYSE stocks.
1664 2018-01-13 22:42:41 U in stocks or crypto haha #BTC
1665 2018-01-13 22:41:25 Or you simply don’t understand that stores shutting down does actually hurt their pockets and effect their stocks and value as a whole. There is this thing called supply and demand. If they have more supply than demand, then they lose out on all that money.

1668 2018-01-13 22:39:10 Online stocks are the future
1669 2018-01-13 22:38:44 More flourishes . How has Trump "turned things around" for anyone other than the rich? Stocks mean nothing to people who don't own them. Coal & other jobs aren't coming back. Carrier jobs left anyway. Wages overall still stagnant. Etc. It's all fool's gold & you're falling for it
1670 2018-01-13 22:37:46 While media is talking about nothing but Trump mental status and him calling nations shit holes, our dollar was decimated and the bond market is in peril this week.  Stocks can rise nominally but value will perish in real terms! What good is entire Dow worth one ounce of gold?!?!
1671 2018-01-13 22:37:43 Oh so you like the rise I. Stocks now the MAGA Pres. Trump is in office !!!!!

1673 2018-01-13 22:36:48 Don’t invest in stocks I’m the stock I’m the empire 
1674 2018-01-13 22:36:39 You bandy "cost" about like it's beyond control. It's simple. Providers charge exorbitant fees because they can. They milk the insurance and what insurance won't pay goes to the patient. #NoDetailedAnalysisRequired HC stocks up 75% 2014, up 55% in 2015.
1675 2018-01-13 22:34:50 If he was so meticulous with all those cameras and planting them all around, why not plant explosives all around? Im not buying it. The FBI is hiding something. Plus, there are no coincidence that the CEO Jim Murren and George Soros sold their stocks. There's way more to it.

1677 2018-01-13 22:33:22 OECD oil demand growth for the last 5 years period was near 2.5% (not annualy, for the entire period). At the same time 5Y avg. of OECD stocks (OPEC target) will increase by the end of the 2018 in comparison with the period of 2010-2014 by 11% #OOTT
1678 2018-01-13 22:29:44 Reality is, and bump stocks & high cap mags 4 two types:
1679 2018-01-13 22:29:31 We're actually doing very well over here. Don't believe everything you see on the BBC. Stocks are up, 2 trillion in new wealth, unemployment at record lows, business handing out $1,000 bonuses etc.Good luck western Europe.
1680 2018-01-13 22:28:06 Probably starts with asking members to take a cut, as per Tata. And insuring the assets, which statistically is a bad deal. Closing the barn door after the horse has bolted.
1681 2018-01-13 22:26:34 I want stocks in what @jimcramer is drinking after that TD!
1682 2018-01-13 22:26:18 I agree. I've said bump stocks are the stupidest things I've seen but I'm not a red neck shooting up a tree stump and drinking beer. The right to sell and buy them, though, should not be restricted. They shrunk mags, going for accessories. What's next? The bullets?
1683 2018-01-13 22:25:47 The profits on USD stocks grow, while the dollar is devaluating. Good news for the prices of importing materials / skilled people? Real estate up, Why? More subprime mortgages without regulation?
1684 2018-01-13 22:24:43 @wallstfitness I’m in OTC stocks for the first time that are Canadian crypto/Blockchain related.

Cryptocurrencies have dual functions: they can act as assets just like stocks, and they can also be used as a store for value, much like gold and silver.

1687 2018-01-13 22:23:11 I guess the stock market has nothing to do with 401k retirement plans thanks to PresTrump my wife & I are doing well as long as the economy is booming &the stocks are up me & my family dont have to worry about what we are going to do when its time to retire thank you Mr President
1688 2018-01-13 22:21:37 Only MJ stocks that interest me at the moment, $EMC.V & $NDVA.V low MC. I like $VP.C share structure could fly on good news. Add $Mari.C as well to that list.
1689 2018-01-13 22:21:21 Indeed seemed to be the case with BHS but feel that many schemes could well be in deficit despite good intentions.... 

But yes, reckless actions more likely when the worst case scenario is minimal personal consequence and a bail out by an unconnected 3rd party.
1690 2018-01-13 22:20:04 The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place. #forex #stocks
1691 2018-01-13 22:19:45 Since automatic weapons and modified weapons are already illegal. The modifying devices or action can be prosecuted, but you are taking the bump stocks manufacture as the criminal and even the owner of the device should have the right to own one.

1694 2018-01-13 22:17:49 Don't you ever get tired of being wrong and/or caught in a lie? Americans, and the world, for that matter, are beyond tired of it. But here's something... your "laughing stocks" are way up, worldwide. I'm sure you'll think that's great news.
1695 2018-01-13 22:17:31 I am a freakin public school teacher who ain't rich! I am one of your so called " normals". I educate myself about stocks and making money.
1696 2018-01-13 22:16:17 The safe bet would be selling communist Twitter stocks right now.
1697 2018-01-13 22:15:58 You don't think Hillary and Bill Clinton  Michelle and Obummer buy stocks? Are they not billionaires? Pres Trump wirked 4 his $$$$$$$ BTW.
1698 2018-01-13 22:15:33 ,
1699 2018-01-13 22:15:09 I'm just sitting here watching how all my stocks have gone through the roof in the past year and feeling very safe at this point
1700 2018-01-13 22:14:59 Just a classic exhibit of idiots and analyst who write/talk about stocks. Completely worthless and even dangerously wrong info. Avoid them like a plague. Follow charts
1701 2018-01-13 22:14:50 Guess you could say the same about stocks and shares. There’s no difference
1702 2018-01-13 22:14:36 "The rich don't care if he wrecks the nation, as long as their stocks go up." is a extremely commonplace sentiment. Especially since the Tax Bill passed.
1703 2018-01-13 22:13:42 investing in stocks was one of my best moves lol

1709 2018-01-13 22:08:07 How are those stocks you sold due to Trump being elected doing?
1710 2018-01-13 22:05:24 It's extreme monetary policy which has increased the value of real assets like stocks & real estate while lessening the value of workers production.  The neo Liberal fascists want to control the economy, take credit for spending $ we don't have then blame Wall St when it crashes.
1711 2018-01-13 22:05:03 I'll bet Rob Sheridan doesn't have any stocks. I have some stocks and I am definitely not a billionaire. My stock and sure many other smart people that don't watch CNN and believe everything the Left tells you.
1712 2018-01-13 22:04:47 Thank you for getting me more from my stocks thanks to the tax cut #MAGA
1713 2018-01-13 22:04:23 Most stocks aren’t owned by ‘simple ppl.’ Thanks for the insult, BTW.
1714 2018-01-13 22:03:08 Luke, I agree with your first point; "'Western gov'ts cannot afford for stocks to fall'". But, Central Banks don't serve Government. Quite, the contrary. An intra-meeting hike requires no Federal discussion or approval.
1715 2018-01-13 22:02:19 "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Rifles and stocks count as arms. I don't blame you for not understanding, though, you can't think too hard without hurting yourself.
1716 2018-01-13 22:01:55 You don't know what you're talking about again.  Billionaires who wealth was in stocks in 2008 watched their net worth DIVE in 2008 and right along with it their dividend income...which for the most part is all of their income. Most billionaires hold stock..not cash.
1717 2018-01-13 22:01:17 Your wrong again stocks are owned by more people than you think
1718 2018-01-13 22:00:55 This is exactly why bailing out the banks, setting interest rates at 0% (which enriches banks with risk free profits), quantitative easing...

Basically the last 8 years of monetary policy was a disaster.  We could have just had a recession instead of a false recovery in stocks.
1719 2018-01-13 21:59:57 Wonder what the deficit reduction plan looks like.
1720 2018-01-13 21:59:48 Oh me too, but neko shop stocks all the diff smiski series so there’s that
1721 2018-01-13 21:59:44 Tryna fw someone is like stocks never know what you gone end out with
1722 2018-01-13 21:59:06 WHO WON THE ELECTION?!  Stop your crying and at least enjoy others’ good fortune.  Try investing in stocks.
1723 2018-01-13 21:58:53 look at all the ceos who under their helm allow their stocks to crumble COMPLETELY they shouldnt get paid AT ALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1724 2018-01-13 21:58:21 he deserves to get paid IF AND ONLY IF he gets his stocks back UP .. papa dont preach' shoudl take notice @Valeant
1725 2018-01-13 21:58:01 Mot allô stocks Ste going Up. Mot mine...
1726 2018-01-13 21:57:56 I don't know about the rest of you I don't know too much about stocks and bonds but I do know I have a 401k  and most Americans who have been working also has a 401k so don't say so lie most of America are affected by the stock market  #retirement plan
1727 2018-01-13 21:57:48 Most ordinary citizens with a 401K or IRA own stocks.  I  do and my IRA grew 30% in Trump's first year!  The stock market affects all Americans.   Hate Trump all you want but don't speak on subjects you do not understand.
1728 2018-01-13 21:57:47 Keep crying snowflake! My Kleenex stocks are going through the roof!
1729 2018-01-13 21:56:49 Your statements are foolish. Most people have some sort of 401k. Most, if not all are invested in stocks. I know you love Obummer but he wasn't the wonderboy that you Trump haters dream about. Like it or not, our new admin is helping America!
1730 2018-01-13 21:56:34 I am not at all wealthy but was taught at a young age to invest either in savings, stocks annuities etc.
1731 2018-01-13 21:55:54 This is a bit of a metaphor for some businesses, many people and the government. 

Overstretched, debt based / geared and the moment there's an issue there's little wriggle room as the debt  needs to be paid.
1732 2018-01-13 21:55:06 Now that is an interesting thought. 

What if in protest 65 million Americans sold off all their stocks and mutual funds In brokerage or 401k funds. 

It would crash the market. 

(Not saying withdraw from 401k, just sell the stocks & putting it into money market)

1735 2018-01-13 21:54:08 Stocks will go down again. 

A little or a lot? Nobody knows. 
Fast or slow? Nobody knows. 
When? Nobody knows. 
Why? Nobody knows.
Which stocks? Nobody knows. 

But we don’t need to know!

1738 2018-01-13 21:52:14 Rob your not taking into account the 401 K plans with Mutual funds that have these stocks in the fund. these plans have grown as well helping those invested through their work, so there are many more taking advantage of the stock market. market growth is from more commerce as wel
1739 2018-01-13 21:51:51 Rob, stocks are an investment strategy for "normal"people, too, you twatwaffle.
1740 2018-01-13 21:50:56 Bet they’re gna talk about stocks and shit
1741 2018-01-13 21:50:50 Indeed, and that's the issue.... It would seem there's been bad practice (Bsps) but there's a danger all DB advice is tarred with the same brush. Some statements I've seen are incredibly sweeping and don't do justice to those seeking the advice.

1751 2018-01-13 21:41:30 There were no economic collapses of Amer economy. Do you need the figures for economic growth/recovery from 2009-2016?

1772 2018-01-13 21:28:30 1-3 Theoretically you are correct.  I have created my own formula to compensate for the shortcoming of the stocks forward cover.   What you are referring to doesn't work any more:  as it stands, it is more bullish than market reality.

1775 2018-01-13 21:26:14 The coins won't make you rich.  The lending platforms that are using Arbitrage and coin trading is how it works.  Stocks are no different.
1776 2018-01-13 21:26:00 TV STOCKS ARE LOW
1777 2018-01-13 21:25:56 Why did your 401k lose money? I’m up 24% in December alone on only two stocks! Where have you placed your bets? (tryna help you, actually)
1778 2018-01-13 21:25:15 You could be with 2 billion dollars and only have 30-50 million dollars in liquid assets available lol. You try to leverage about 1-10% of debt and the rest is quarterly dividends payed out from stocks in the companies you own.
1779 2018-01-13 21:25:03 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-12, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
1780 2018-01-13 21:25:00 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-12, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
1781 2018-01-13 21:20:51 Not everyone can afford to buy stocks.  Lots of people can barely afford food and shelter,  you know,  the basics.
1782 2018-01-13 21:20:23 Most of your supporters are on Govt assistance, THEY DON'T HAVE STOCKS! Re-check the job losses this week, Carrier, Sam's Club etc. lots lost jobs this week
1783 2018-01-13 21:20:04 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. #trade #forex #stocks
1784 2018-01-13 21:20:00 Mr. PRESIDENT Trump: We here in Michigan knew what was going to make America Great Again!  Now we yet again, wait for the rest to catch up! Sure their paychecks, stocks, and way of life, will help!
THANKS MR. PRESIDENT.
1785 2018-01-13 21:18:52 The number of people who instantly will have access to #crypto is way larger than those who had access to US tech stocks in the 90s. Once this becomes well known most of the world will be able to use it. #cryptocurrency
1786 2018-01-13 21:18:52 Most of us don't own stocks doesn't mean a thing to us. TRUMP is a RACIST scammer who assaults women
1787 2018-01-13 21:17:42 The committee will be selling @mint250988 testimonial brochure tomorrow we will be around the ground before the game come and get yours. They’ll then be on sale at testimonial events whilst stocks last 
1788 2018-01-13 21:15:43 Trump just started his fiscal year a couple of months ago, before that he was riding the trend. Let's discuss it again around June or July when it really counts. As far as stocks,let's  see, food and utilities or stocks, tough choice. That's how 3/4 of the u.s. live.
1789 2018-01-13 21:14:37 The Uranium One scandal centers on the partial sale of the Canadian firm Uranium One to Russia’s atomic energy giant Rosatom. The Obama admin was required to approve the sale b/c it transferred 20 % of U.S. uranium stocks to Russia.
1790 2018-01-13 21:13:47 You’re blaming trump for the Americans who do not own stocks? This is their own fault, the success of the stock market has been well known since the 1930s
1791 2018-01-13 21:13:32 So, let me get this straight. He did it ALL by his lonesome with a couple of AR-15’s that we’re equipped with bump stocks. We didn’t just fall off of a turnip truck FBI. Jesus Christ almighty! Give the citizens of this country a break from your tyranny!
1792 2018-01-13 21:13:18 I wanna get into all kinds of insurance, taxes, real estate, stocks etc. No, I do not want to make a career out of any of these but these are some of the most important aspects of life we learn the least about
1793 2018-01-13 21:10:26 When it first started I thought it was going to be a BBD cover
1794 2018-01-13 21:10:18 Why does gold have to be overvalued? QE distorts just about every correlation why not on gold? CB are buying it. Inflation is creeping up. Rates are rising. Stocks could blow apart. Gold may be a hedge or a pure long for a while to come. The obituary on gold is premature.
1795 2018-01-13 21:09:59 It’s all good watching Holly’s revolution concealer video and really wanting to try it and then finding out your local Superdrug doesn’t stock it but stocks literally everything else Makeup Revolution do  @HollyBoon__

Centres can usually play any forward position and a lot of coaches play them together.
1801 2018-01-13 21:06:39 Economy is up and down, up mostly since W's mess (lost HALF my 401k, how bout u?) - I don't deny the jump in stocks after election.
Tax cuts will not = jobs. I live in KS. Can't even fund our schools.

1807 2018-01-13 21:03:44 I was reading that NY is divesting from energy stocks. This is what happens when you leave the wallet in reach of politicians - they’re going to miss one of the biggest bull cycle runs in commodity history. I guess their pension plans are too rich.

1811 2018-01-13 21:01:09 Great point but job growth poor. Economic growth stocks benefit wealthy, job stagnation affects non-rich folks. How's that help?

1818 2018-01-13 20:53:31 People in 1999 thought the same about dotcom stocks. No market is invincible, man. I promise you, maintaining HEALTHY skepticism will help you preserve so much capital. Not only in crypto, but in life.
1819 2018-01-13 20:53:29 To all the haters, eating whole foods is the most direct way to nourish yourself with the sun's energy plain and simple. We aren't pioneers who need to fill our fat stocks to survive the winter. Try and help the world you live in, factory farming is bad.

1824 2018-01-13 20:50:58 40% probabilty market could melt up 30% from SPX 2725 level to 3500 in 2018. 
Three Reasons :
Lower corporate Tax rates 35% to 21%.
Repatriation of near $2.5 Trillions fr Overseas by US corps
10 Yr. rates rise to rise near 3% from 2.53%, Billions of bond to roll over to Stocks
1825 2018-01-13 20:49:16 My big liquor store has them. There has to be one in NOVA that stocks them.
1826 2018-01-13 20:48:45 I believe it's the same idea as comparing stocks to the index they're included in.
1827 2018-01-13 20:48:08 Learning about stocks and bonds.  my head hurts.
1828 2018-01-13 20:48:06 He owns stocks in prisons. That's why he's doing this. He has no clue about the medical benefits of marijuana. He lives in the 1910s, he's racist and anti marijuana. He also thinks women should have no power. Get after sessions.
1829 2018-01-13 20:45:52 10% U.S. Mid-Cap Stocks
10% U.S. Small-Cap Stocks
10% International Stocks

60% US Bonds

That's all you need to know to start
1830 2018-01-13 20:45:46 Life IS a risk, libtard. No risk on reward. Americans. DON'T HAVE TO participate in stocks, BUT THEY CAN
1831 2018-01-13 20:45:31 Only way you can get a discounted rate in America on stocks/equities/securities is through "qualified capital gains" or "qualified dividends", which entails the companies you own being American. So due to crypto's ambiguous, international nature, that's not happening for anyone.
1832 2018-01-13 20:44:03 das tor wird nicht gegeben wegen hohen stocks. aber sorry, der ablenker war nicht über der latte
1833 2018-01-13 20:43:58 I like the people that mention an incoming head and shoulders pattern, as they're almost always wrong. I have a theory tidy just like making shapes in charts.

Also, most the patterns relate to stocks. Crypto is it's own wild self, it's too new and volatile for anyone to read.

1842 2018-01-13 20:40:22 Not necessarily. XRP is more than capable to overcome a drop to the 61.8% correction. Many stocks and cryptos overcome this.

1876 2018-01-13 20:11:40 I answered your question. If you get a pension whether through a private company or a Union, they all invest in the stock market. Same with 401Ks they invest in stocks. And I am just a working class person.

1899 2018-01-13 19:55:03 Been trading for 7 years, that is my cryptonight. Do you stop out at break even once there is a bit of unrealized or follow the original stop loss? I swing trade short same stocks as yourself.

1901 2018-01-13 19:50:10 The whole subject of social media shaming & firing is problematic IMHO. Have we moved that far beyond stocks, pillories & flogging?

1904 2018-01-13 19:48:25 What kind of stocks are y’all buying
1905 2018-01-13 19:47:42 Stocks increasing... companies doing well... can hire and create competition... employees will have choices... each worker benefits ... more jobs... better jobs... sometimes when outlook changes, companies clean house 1st

1907 2018-01-13 19:46:24 Can't quibble with that, but boy are storage options coming on fast and dropping in price. Good time to divest from oil stocks

1910 2018-01-13 19:39:52 Hi trainee trader, imo learning that 'trading' (ramped) aim resources stocks is the quickest way to lose your money is a big first step to returns.  Maybe unfollow anyone who does this and never touch one again.
Good luck tho
1911 2018-01-13 19:37:01 IM BUYING STOCKS ! 
1912 2018-01-13 19:36:59 the economy is on crack ladies n gents. Stocks are climaxing. Real estate is kaboomin. Travel is higher than ever. Everybody spending money
1913 2018-01-13 19:36:03 So u liked it better when stocks plummeted (thanks Obama) .  If us economy is hurting we all hurt. Business owners are Americans too.
1914 2018-01-13 19:35:35 2017: This all kind of stinks, let's try to resist and maybe things won't be so bad. 2018: Well nuclear war seems like a real option at any point in time soooooo ... *stocks up on shrimp-flavored ramen.*
1915 2018-01-13 19:34:44 That's what happened to the Swedish banks in the 1990s. It worked. The banks who got bailouts had to surrender their stocks to public ownership. The banks who didn't want that, didn't get any public funds. The UK and US should have done that in 2008.

1927 2018-01-13 19:15:43 Since months I sit late night with Dad to discuss stocks, how the market did n what my charts are saying for tomorrow, he himself said "shouldn't say bt you have been right like 9 out of 10 times" but when I say "I have got a great trade idea" he says "you're not increasing size"
1928 2018-01-13 19:15:42 If you don't have too much money and go out in the weeds though, it's a different game though. Lot of these microcap stocks swing to their own tune and most have betas close to 0. It's quasi private-equity.
1929 2018-01-13 19:14:03 Hahaha thank you. I can't hold the MOMO stocks - just psychologically very difficult. I sold most of my $NVDA at 60 - there is a story behind it - I shall tell someday...

1932 2018-01-13 19:13:00 Most of his net worth is in his stocks, since he owns over 80 million stocks in Amazon. Net worth is Assets - Liabilities. Not all of it is money. Even then, he's doing enough to help 1,000 Dreamers. What's Trump doing for the Dreamers?
1933 2018-01-13 19:12:29 I'm no expert in finance, not having money means it is not an area of life I have had to become familiar with, but it seems ultimately shareholders and directors are responsible, but seemingly get off the hook, profits tucked away.

1936 2018-01-13 19:08:16 Sorry, guys. The problem is not with CoinExchangeio, it is with Stocks Exchange.
1937 2018-01-13 19:07:32 Not....this is how stocks markets get affected. You could announce, you like Walmart, and...boom, stocks in Walmart will go up, because a POTUS said he liked it. Moron.
1938 2018-01-13 19:07:11 Suspect there could be a lot of unintended consequences in such circumstances, not least companies bailing on their DB (ala Tata Steel).
1939 2018-01-13 19:05:51 Um not the same. When Obama inherited the disaster Bush created the stock market was dying. When Dotard took office stocks had recovered. Not an accurate comparison. Our Education system at work clearly lacks if you believe this is an accurate comparison. #ignorance

1947 2018-01-13 19:01:22 Bond market will never crash in nominal terms, never does in these situations.  Instead, it collapses in real terms.  UST's have collapsed v healthcare premiums, v college tuition, v stocks, v real estate, even v gold last 15 yrs

1950 2018-01-13 18:57:59 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
1951 2018-01-13 18:57:52 I don't think it fair that any profits to shareholders or bonuses to the board are paid out while the fund is running in deficit, surely that is a legitimate incentive to end the deficit.
1952 2018-01-13 18:56:55 Some Americans care about more than stocks and money, shocker, I know.
1953 2018-01-13 18:55:49 From what we have seen stocks is not a scam but just a small exchanges not ready for many new costumers. However for the time being we do recommend Cryptobridge over stocks anywhere were people ask us.
1954 2018-01-13 18:55:37 True. But “trampled grass”. Bond market didn’t crash. Stocks went up. Government, thy name is liar! Why pine for something that has never in history been achieved?
1955 2018-01-13 18:54:59 For as long as there are stocks! :)
1956 2018-01-13 18:54:31 Perhaps. Hence my earlier tweet earlier that those who 'dont behave' can't be bailed out else there's no consequence.

If not enough, levy goes up... schemes in deficit have to turn things around in a reasonable length of time but issue is where employer goes bust.
1957 2018-01-13 18:54:11 I don’t understand the graphic.
 
So long-term P/E ratio 10 stocks are best.
But when is the P/E ratio 10 during the 20yr timeframe?

Rebalance every year based on pe ratio?
1958 2018-01-13 18:53:07 I have an idea for a show public stocks soft toys thrown at creators/commissioners of astonishingly bad shows with clips voted for by public. This is an example.

I wanted to buy some your coins, but my deposit didn’t appear on their exchange! There are many the same buyers! Scam! Please, make an announcement on your page
1971 2018-01-13 18:45:49 The Pension protection fund which is funded by levies on other pension schemes. 

Unf the 'good' schemes pay for the failures...
1972 2018-01-13 18:44:45 I  have to go away for a space. For all these supporters of trump, in another year from now, when our economy collapes, the stocks fall and interest rates go up and inflation runs rampant, remember who put you there. And we will be alone in this world, having lost our allies.
1973 2018-01-13 18:44:15 So, if say Carillion goes bust, and they say that there is over £500 million pension deficit, who pays the pension to the staff or do the staff loose out?

1978 2018-01-13 18:42:25 What specific steps has he taken that directly approves the average American? Tax reform has not impacted yet, most Americans do not have 401k and do not own stocks. The fact is the economy was on cruise control before trump took office. @POTUS
1979 2018-01-13 18:41:20 Super dope! Nice how youve done it. Did you use brushes, filter or stocks?

1984 2018-01-13 18:38:22 I watch market every day. I don't think it's the nature of the beast to crash "hard & fast" without indicators. Still am a bit skeptical and am not currently buying new stocks although looking at one sector as being promising. I have beat S&P for last 10 yrs since I fired broker

I hate to tell you folks, but you don't need a Bump Stock to make your semi-auto into fully automatic. There is a simple technique that is just as accurate and doesn't require any modifications.
You can ban Bump Stocks but it won't stop anything.I wish it could
1992 2018-01-13 18:34:53 There's many reasons that schemes are 'underfunded' or in deficit ... It started with FRS17 but much can be down to hypothetical calculations, stock markets and gilt yields. Not all deficits are down to poor management. Also, failed DB schemes aren't propped up by Gvt.

1996 2018-01-13 18:32:14 Quick, buy Pharma stocks. The prices will skyrocket when word gets out that that this is a real thing. Antibiotics will need to be taken daily, by everyone, if this trend catches on.
1997 2018-01-13 18:32:10 Who is buying the stocks? Is it Russians making Trump look good? Something seems very dodgy
1998 2018-01-13 18:32:08 You know he doesn't actually have $101 lying around though right. The way stocks works just means he's worth the value of the percentage of HIS company, Amazon, that he owns. You want the government to seize his company? Cause that's the only way it would be illegal to be rich.
1999 2018-01-13 18:30:59 Thx Jawad. IMO, we are getting seriously close to the end game scenario @LukeGromen, whereby, any correction in stocks has massive repercussions for the economy and in turn monetary policy. Besides a potential BoP problem, public sector liabilities have only grown since the GFC.

2001 2018-01-13 18:30:04 I only make 30,000 a year... Far from rich. I think that makes me lower middle class, yet my 401K and stocks are benefiting. It has nothing to do with being rich. You have no idea what you are talking about.
2002 2018-01-13 18:29:35 envoyez les stocks aux US surtout dans le sud
2003 2018-01-13 18:28:08 Even if you don't personally invest in the market your 401K is. Also you can invest in ETFs which means you're invested in sectors & not holding individual stocks. There are ways.
2004 2018-01-13 18:27:43 Trump's shithole cult followers are in denial that corporations are using this money to buy back stocks. They are also laying off workers like never before. Slowest job growth since 2010!
2005 2018-01-13 18:25:10 Here are some policies the Nazis instituted when they came to power:

All very socialist.

2009 2018-01-13 18:24:08 Not BS. #Facts The bull market in stocks started in March 2009. This market upswing is now 103 months old, the second-longest in history. Trump can claim credit for 11 months. The other 92 months of upward trajectory took place under Obama.
2010 2018-01-13 18:24:02 Now that pensions are dead literally everyone in corp america buys stocks every week automatically in 401k/employer match. So this is no surprise & will always be high.
2011 2018-01-13 18:22:20 Yeah, Trumps booming economy with tens of thousands of layoffs before February! Also, most Americans don't own stocks. The stock market is a useless indicator for economic strength. Oh yeah. GFY!
2012 2018-01-13 18:21:37 There is no right or wrong time to invest, stay invested all the time in quality stocks, buy little in bull market , buy more in bear mkt.

2025 2018-01-13 18:12:36 Thanks, @jeffsessions for the deal on pot stocks. Down 10%-40% this week. I love a sale! Adding to everything - $PRMCF $EMMBF $ACBFF $TWMJF $APHQF $CBWTF $MRMD $LHSIF
2026 2018-01-13 18:12:01 I'm new to stock market,its only 5 months. I follow only Atul sir and his principles which he had mentioned in one of the blog while selecting stocks myself. Like P/E vs ind P/E, bv, low debt, increasing sales, promoter holding, low volume, mid or small cap. Thank you Atul sir:)

2038 2018-01-13 18:06:12 I lost a lot of $$$$ in NVDA, NFLX and MU. Not gonna touch it even if it sky rockets. Some people revenge trade and I just walk away wanting nothing to do with stocks that cost me! LOL! As I grow as a trader, I may change my mind but for now am avoiding!

Based on my knowledge in Fundamental Analyses, I found following stocks are good. Please let me know your opinion.

1) PINCON SPRITS
2) GLOBAL SPRIT
3) TV18BROADCAST
4) HIGH GROUND ENTERPRISES
2046 2018-01-13 18:03:34 You for some reason declined to mention factors that "do good" to the 50% who don't own stocks: lowest unemployment in 17 years among black americans and lowest unemployment insurance filings in 44 years
2047 2018-01-13 18:02:59 Yes, took me a while to figure this. Trade a Cash acct, NOT margin. Money settles Next Day with Options, 2 days with Stocks. Start again Next Day. Shouldnt be using margin anyway unless you are a PRO.
2048 2018-01-13 18:02:56 $1 in large value stocks on 3/9/09 is worth $6 today, unless it’s Vanguard’s version, and then it’s just $4.7

2079 2018-01-13 17:48:35 They are having trouble seeing 2%, so that is a remote factor. Hyper inflation would not be good for stocks. See Germany in the 1920's and to a much smaller scale the U.S. in the late 70's early 80's
2080 2018-01-13 17:48:00 You really are out of touch if you think $1,000 (that's less than $100 per month) is going to make much of a difference to people living pay check to pay check.

2094 2018-01-13 17:41:02 That is because you are stupid and don't know how to pay yourself first! Even someone on minimum wage can save through stocks or mutual funds! You apparently are financially uneducated and aren't wise with your money.

2096 2018-01-13 17:40:19 I take your point. Could well be binary. If only a small % of money leaves stocks for gold, there will be a price stampede.

2147 2018-01-13 17:12:26 I think the BEST stock plays are being missed with this crypto madness. Stocks > Crypto. People should just buying a “coin” called $MGM - it’s $35 and will double. How about a $VKTX “coin” for $4.80? Or even a “coin” called $AMZN which is less than 1 $ETH.
2148 2018-01-13 17:12:18 Or go trade low float penny stocks on the stock market.
2149 2018-01-13 17:11:43 I still think it is funny that the MSM thought that all of the stocks would plummet with the Trump Presidency, but the New York Stock exchange keeps hitting record highs! However the only time they have plummeted was when the MSM’s fake news stories were broadcasted.
2150 2018-01-13 17:11:36 I own stock.  I'm not in the too 10% as many stockholders are.  But it involvescmore than stocks.  401k's, small capital and other such vehicles are among them, and quite a larfe number of Americans are involved in these privstely or via their States and Employers.

2154 2018-01-13 17:09:19 Stocks matter to more than 170 million you idiot.  Public pension funds, private pensions, 401ks, 403bs, and 529s ALL RELY heavily on the stock market.  We'll do our best to assure it doesn't affect you.
2155 2018-01-13 17:08:55 $TICC my theory high yielders  , bonds , taking a hit do to rising interest rates , reduced spreads , money flowing to stocks  and crypto.

2157 2018-01-13 17:08:05 Dear Lord sana magkaron na ng stocks yung gusto ko
2158 2018-01-13 17:07:32 Do you own stocks?
2159 2018-01-13 17:07:11 10% own 84% of the stocks in this country. Those of us who hastily have 401Ks may be underwhelmed by that answer. I’d rather hear that gas prices will be lower or at least remain steady for a while.

2164 2018-01-13 17:04:53 I ordered another batch of PeriPera Inks! Stocks are running low already.. 
2165 2018-01-13 17:04:10 Dnb stocks seem to be skyrocketing...... Nice
2166 2018-01-13 17:03:42 There are not enough stocks
2167 2018-01-13 17:02:33 I'm bad at multitasking. Lately, I've been so obsessed with researching stocks that I forgot to watch Dek's video lessons. I should learn how to balance my trading life just like Dek explained on "Traits of Success" lesson. One day, I will financially independent! @DekmarTrades
2168 2018-01-13 17:01:56 E1174 This piggy agrees fullheartedly with Stacy regarding long-gold and has stocks to back this (suffered badly but bleeding stopped) yet if interest rates are raised enough, derivatives will crash. Max is spot-on regarding what silver will do! #SilverLiberationArmy OINK! 
2169 2018-01-13 17:01:25 The pharmaceutical chain is a lot more complicated than that. unfortunately.  CVS stocks stores via Cardinal, or in other regions other suppliers, which in turn carry or not carry manufacturers because the drug may have been sold to another manufacturer.  It's a mess.

2173 2018-01-13 16:59:42 Anyone can buy stocks at anytime
2174 2018-01-13 16:59:31 That’s when you buy tho! When those stocks dip like that it’s always knee jerk short term. You get to invest at low risk prices. If they go up and stick you when, if they don’t you had minimal risk invested anyway. No harm done.
2175 2018-01-13 16:59:29 Glad you got yours. Sucks to be an average American that didn't get a bonus and can't afford stocks and gets to pay for your good fortune.
2176 2018-01-13 16:59:02 Want this too 
2177 2018-01-13 16:58:38 Prevent food waste by repurposing leftovers scraps. Use vegetable and meat scraps in homemade stocks, and use citrus fruit rinds and zest to add flavor to other meals.
2178 2018-01-13 16:58:26 This just shows your ignorance. Quit complaining and learn. There are lots of safe stocks with large caps that pay good dividends.
2179 2018-01-13 16:56:58 i will never get over 17 year olds on twitter acting like they're up in toei's stocks or some shit.... "super sentai is back" no super sentai never left you just didn't care about the other seasons
2180 2018-01-13 16:56:31 I opened a sharebuilder account many years ago and had $200 of my paycheck deposited there every 2 weeks. I picked out a moderate stock investment purchase plan. They buy portions and whole stocks for me and over the years it has built a nice portfolio for me. CapitalOne Investin
2181 2018-01-13 16:56:22 Fine, 84% of all stocks are owned by the wealthy... I don't know where you got that exactly but let's assume you're not lying. Check the percentages of taxes the same group pays and amount of total wealth.  I bet they're both greater than 84%..  do you know what that implies?
2182 2018-01-13 16:54:37 I was 18 years old when I started investing in stocks. Of course that was the 80’s when we had the first economic boom under Pres Reagan.
2183 2018-01-13 16:54:28 Everybody is gung-ho rest of the world outperforming--US stocks have been outperforming most of the rest of the world since late August. Japan is an exception.
2184 2018-01-13 16:54:02 I get where you are going and if I had my way I personally like to see bump stocks gone. Government banning is NOT the answer. I can not force my will on that "gun toy" on other people.
2185 2018-01-13 16:53:08 I want!!! 
2186 2018-01-13 16:53:08 Out of touch? Wow dude you have issues. Stocks matter to me. MAGA thanks President Trump.
2187 2018-01-13 16:52:10 Out of the thousands of semi auto rifles like the 3 in my safe held onto by law abiding citizens how many have killed even one person? Personally I don’t agree with bump stocks but look at what they are doing to us in California! NO PISTOL GRIP NO FORWARD GRIP chipping awayat 2A
2188 2018-01-13 16:51:21 Wrong. A corporations CEO has an obligation to return investment to its investors not the employees. It's his fiduciary obligation or he will be fired. Also what they do with the tax cuts is buy back stocks. Double win for corporations.

2190 2018-01-13 16:50:30 Obama is what was killing the stock market and American jobs. Stocks ride and fall on a day to day basis, how can you contribute to Obama?
Not very smart are you.
2191 2018-01-13 16:50:27 Not interested in life and safety but yet no action from the Trump administration on gun control or bump stocks or protecting the environment.  The military does not shut down.  Your base is small. Most people do not like you and want you to  resign.
2192 2018-01-13 16:49:19 It's not a matter of paranoia... It's a historical event that took place. Rational people can see that bump stocks serve no genuine purpose even freedom and pro gun advocates like me can get behind it.  It's purpose is only dangerous as proven.
2193 2018-01-13 16:48:54 Dang #vanguard I've made over 500 bucks in two weeks off vtsax. Stocks are crazy right now! #investing
2194 2018-01-13 16:48:52 I'm one of most middle class Americans who have managed to build a nice nest egg thanks to stocks.  You're clearly out of touch.  Do your homework first before you make ridiculous claims.
2195 2018-01-13 16:48:35 Roy Sheridan I can send you some. Coloring  books and crayons enough of your trash now, many of us have stocks but you make it sound only the rich can have stocks
2196 2018-01-13 16:47:50 Chemicals producing plants to remain shutdown through out 2018 in China, will cause greater demand steep price rise...

Tell me which stocks are gng to effect positive???
2197 2018-01-13 16:47:38 Fish stocks 
2198 2018-01-13 16:47:10 Hey Rob you sound foolish. Stocks being up helps everybody.More money being spent more jobs created 401ks up

2200 2018-01-13 16:45:55 That said, using your logic that market is pricing no harm to largest tech firms, the fact that since Feb 2015 - Dec 2017 cable/telco stocks way up would prove definitely that T2 #NetNeutrality didn't harm ISPs
2201 2018-01-13 16:45:20 Best stocks to take advantage of the move! $ARRRF $GALXF $KATFF $LEMIF $PILBF $NMKEF $NTTHF $GLCNF $ALTAF $LTHHF $UEC
2202 2018-01-13 16:44:31 1) Invest in bitcoin or other crypto currency which is really sketchy 
2) Become a computer science major and use coding to analyze trends in/ classify large amounts of data
3) Build/Use code to rapidly buy and sell stocks that have a difference between the buy/sell price 4 $$
2203 2018-01-13 16:43:57 Most of the people you are referring as the rich came from nothing! They worked hard and had the drive to create, develop and grow!  Turn off your computer, get off your ass and work to create your own future! I guarantee you will be buying stocks with a big smile in your face.
2204 2018-01-13 16:43:51 Unless you own plenty of stocks, there isn't any more money in your pocket right now. 

Isis was never a threat to US soil, but a massive threat to people in the ME. How many Americans did isis kill? I'll wait.
2205 2018-01-13 16:43:37 Noticed you never gave any facts to support this! My 401K/Stocks didn’t grow with Obama like they grow with Pres Trump. I have the statements. Those are the facts!
2206 2018-01-13 16:43:16 midnight shift & 10 to 7 job 2 days back to back. tmr end at 730am, send mom to market. need to bring nenek to chong pang to buy new radio. need to send ua stocks to jurong east.
2207 2018-01-13 16:42:49 Start buying stocks mate....its a free market...what you are doing is called wining....or do you want the government to give stocks as well!!!
2208 2018-01-13 16:42:31 @kingpol86 Yeah, I was just buying stocks. Didn’t know a thing. I’m glad I took the initiative to learn. Otherwise I’d be out.
2209 2018-01-13 16:41:54 Obama set in place a good stable base and a solid mechanism for recovery from 2008. Trump has added the ‘Trump trade’ to this: a bubble of overpriced stocks waiting to pop and maniacal speculation. It’s not a one-answer question.
2210 2018-01-13 16:41:39 Ha ha guys giving name of stocks for recommendations 
2211 2018-01-13 16:41:02 no one tell apple but......I was just able to delete the Stocks and Tips apps???!
2212 2018-01-13 16:40:15 Stocks are core to 401k, 529, core to American retirement savings,  and college funds...@realDonaldTrump deserves credit where it is due..
2213 2018-01-13 16:39:56 Most of the tiny penny stocks operating in the newly formed marijuana markets are complete garbage. That’s the truth of it. But there are a few that have a legitimate chance of becoming Blue Chip Marijuana Firms.
2214 2018-01-13 16:39:31 when the pullback is bottoming the new leading stocks from dominant sectors will move out first
2215 2018-01-13 16:39:08 @NRA There are two days left, and your support is vital. The #ATF is planning to finalize their ban on "bump stocks" at the end of this month.
2216 2018-01-13 16:38:37 Between now and Fusion Super Bull goal of 3K for R2K most will miss the fruits using mainstream but eroding valuation/risk models. Why? They already missed the gains so far, botched hard to analyze stocks already, faked out by relying on the old risk measures..
2217 2018-01-13 16:37:42 when you screen the market for strength in a pullback you will see the sector stocks that dominate.
2218 2018-01-13 16:36:51 Trump better chill he gonna affect my stocks
2219 2018-01-13 16:36:45 @MenloMicro Is this company going to become public for people to invest through stocks?
2220 2018-01-13 16:36:43 I'm turning 65 and mostly in stocks.  where else can i put money for any type of return?
2221 2018-01-13 16:36:29 penny stocks vs. blue chips. ‘joke’ vs. ‘real’ cryptocurrencies. all little BITS of history repeating.
2222 2018-01-13 16:36:18 @allstarcharts I have to tell you.  I have never been so bored or happier, holding stocks based on your analysis. BA CAT BRKB CSCO GLW SCHW AAPL DAL all from much lower.  New buys MLM weekly chart unreal CXO MAS NEM PAAS ABX.  JC, thank you so much. Allstarcharts Rocks!!
2223 2018-01-13 16:36:09 When did AMERICA turn into a BUSINESS? I listen to the news & All I hear  is how the "stocks"went up/how people want to come here for a better way of life because of the money and the jobs. What ever happened to "AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL, LAND THAT I LOVE"?
2224 2018-01-13 16:36:05 Rob - can you please post your resource on the ownership of stocks?
2225 2018-01-13 16:35:59 No it wouldn't. Bump stock add nothing in practical purpose to the weapon. It decreases accuracy and is essentially bullet masterbation. Gun oil cleans the weapon, magazines have a functional purpose. Bump stocks only detriment the operation of the weapon.
2226 2018-01-13 16:34:46 Um, stocks are the catalyst to the basic of our economy as a whole, this country needs a kick in the ass economy wise and we're getting it.
2227 2018-01-13 16:34:35 عزيزى كيف الخروج بربح 3% - النظام يحقق ارباح كبيرة وخسائر بسيطة لمعدلات نجاح كبيرة - تابع الصفحة وساكون معا للرد على اى استفسار مرة اخرى - النظام صمم ليعطى اكبر قدر من الربح بامان - ثانيا ليس لنا اسهم بالسوق وبالتالى ليس لنا عاطفة ولا نية
2228 2018-01-13 16:34:23 Because Crypto will eventually crash and then stabilize and be boring like stocks.
2229 2018-01-13 16:33:34 This is an old idea, there are academic papers about it, William O'Neil and Stan Weinstein have wrote chapters about it (wrt US stocks). Better a good stock in a leading sector, than great stock in lagging one.
2230 2018-01-13 16:32:42 Stupid question chase.   Q - can you withdraw all your profits at anytime. ..... like holding stocks you can sell and then withdraw?
2231 2018-01-13 16:32:39 Some of us get screwed. Even if you invest in stocks to offset losses, screwed by cap gains tax. Ppl moved to where they are based on financial maneuverability. That we are getting punished is wrong. We should be grandfathered in. Decrease SALT for incoming residents.
2232 2018-01-13 16:32:29 @rob_sheridan you might want to do a little more research on that you twit pretty much anybody that has a job gets 401K has stocks bonds and so on
2233 2018-01-13 16:32:28 "Turn on Trump."  Sounds like an agenda.  Job growth, economy booming, lowest unemployment, stocks increased, wage increases, taxes cut...
Just how are Democrats gonna win anything when they owe everything to Trump?! And yes, he's an ass, but an ass that kicks Democrats.
2234 2018-01-13 16:31:48 Oooooooo $11. What a damn windfall!  Still not enough to survive on.  Maybe they can buy stocks with this sudden raise. I’m sure that’s a priority! Come on dude.
2235 2018-01-13 16:31:17 Buy a mutual fund, one that mirrors the S&P... invest don't whine.... u don't have to play the victim and you don't have to be rich to own stocks.
2236 2018-01-13 16:30:08 I used to do stocks too then said fuck it hahahahaha too much gains in crypto

2238 2018-01-13 16:29:27 Funny since my 401 was in stocks.   My dad retired as middle class but very wealth from stock.. We"not the top 10%.   We don't have brokers.   We just know what to do,  don't gamble,  and don't don't complain.... And it NOT thanks to obama.... He had nothing to do with it.
2239 2018-01-13 16:27:55 I was so opposed to stocks haircut but now I’m like damn baby who is u? Like I got a whole new man and he is smokin 
2240 2018-01-13 16:27:09 No health care and deductibles are not the reason if you get paid 11 dollars a hour how do you expect to put in 401k? So basically its either put in stocks or be able to survive which one you choosing?

2242 2018-01-13 16:24:49 Guarantee if Clinton won this stuff wouldn’t be happening. Stocks are a lot about perspective. The night Trump won the markets reflected great optimism because of Trumps business background.
2243 2018-01-13 16:22:38 Some people, I would venture to say the majority of the middle class,  don't have any disposable income left after paying school loans, rent, heat, food, and healthcare, to invest in stocks. And that's the point! We aren't the Investor class because we can't afford to be.
2244 2018-01-13 16:22:35 I got to see it to believe it!  Stocks and employment is an OBAMA TREND WHETHER YOU WANT TI BELIEVE TRUTH OR NOT!!!
2245 2018-01-13 16:22:33 Goes to show you how clueless people are. Stocks/economy started booming as soon as @realDonaldTrump took office! Wake up people #MAGA
2246 2018-01-13 16:21:33 But that's exactly how Trump would want people to think it is , it's why he has so many books on how to be rich and successful like him.....somehow I don't think it works ....because it's a scam!

Stocks are always a risk, average Americans just won't make it big.

2248 2018-01-13 16:21:25 It's just going to lead to people investing their money in offshore biz, rental income or stocks.  Why would anyone invest $1M to earn $20k and put up with tons of BS and red tape? Take away the incentive, you take away the investment. Pretty darn simple.

2251 2018-01-13 16:20:23 Yeah that sounds like everything Trump says ....isn't one of his slogans hows your 401k which he was saying before the tax cuts even ....

And as for the rest get rich quick schemes never work , if stocks were that easy everyone would be rich.
2252 2018-01-13 16:20:15 It's a nightmare - I bet at the time you were well happy so no point getting too upset. It's been a huge Lesson for me that my Biggest Error in past has been selling Great Stocks too early. Sold #XPP around 1800p I think - grrrr
2253 2018-01-13 16:20:12 We condemn other countries for their actions and mistakes they must laugh and say what nerve we're slowly becoming the laughing stocks of the world!
2254 2018-01-13 16:19:29 Thank u Trump and as for the comment about only rich ppl own stocks I would put myself in the lower class and I'm invested
2255 2018-01-13 16:19:17 Stocks are a proven investment!
2256 2018-01-13 16:19:00 Gonna go to bed now, hopefully I wake up tomorrow and my stocks shot up and I’m a millionaire
2257 2018-01-13 16:18:20 So you are saying "most Americans" are racist I guess the country hasn't change much since it was stolen from the natives. SAD SO SAD.  Jobs and stocks have been going up since 2009 dumb ass
2258 2018-01-13 16:18:20 You don’t need a PhD in criminology to sort this out. He carries it out with, um, guns with bump stocks. Gun laws are still weak and unenforced. Bump stocks are still legal. Fake handwringing brought to you by the complicit gangstas of the NRA and the GOP.
2259 2018-01-13 16:16:58 High-value crypto assets with strong track record that are deemed the most stable. 
Origin of term blue-chip stocks, comes from poker, where the blue chip is generally assigned the highest value.

2263 2018-01-13 16:16:26 Exactly. This is not exactly mom & pop investors. This is the very wealthiest buying up 30 or so stocks.

I’m just a God fearing conservative thanking God every day we got ourselves a real American President who is tired of all the corruption in DC!! Thank God and thanks for that money I made on my small percentage of stocks!
2267 2018-01-13 16:12:34 The stupidity is real!!! Obama in no way shape or form is responsible for today’s economy. The moment Trump was elected the stocks went up and never looked back! The proof is obvious and I don’t understand how naive people can be!
2268 2018-01-13 16:12:14 There’s far more stress/effort free ways to make a passive income then a franchise - Masternodes/dividend yielding stocks/Amazon product business (via their FBA program - they do all the shipping and customer service for you) those are just a few... the franchise biz is tough.
2269 2018-01-13 16:11:50 I really love waking up every day to see my stocks holding my pockets down 
2270 2018-01-13 16:11:21 How many early investors are now millionaires? We all wish we invested.

Obviously much more speculative/volatile than stocks and gold, but same function.

More risks, more rewards. Be ready to lose everything, or to get the jackpot. The market will calm down when it matures
2271 2018-01-13 16:10:18 I check my stocks everyday. And recently I've been losing money. 
2272 2018-01-13 16:10:08 Ever changing cycles of human insecurity. Here's what people should ask themselves. If my future liabilities can be met by combination x of Stocks, Bonds and Contributions from income with probability y, why am I looking for magical free lunches?
2273 2018-01-13 16:09:45 @jimcramer My stock portfolio (non IRA) return for 2017 was 109.35%, since 8/11/16 election day 165.91%. I show negative capital gains, but strong dividends;although those stocks underperformed. This YTD 15.65%. My margin is 50%+. Should i trim my Trump gain @larrykudlowCNBC
2274 2018-01-13 16:09:01 my stocks are doing so good
2275 2018-01-13 16:08:56 WEEKEND REVIEW: 8 stocks to sell (with 1 disagreement)... $RAD $PCG $SNAP $UA $GPRO and more at 247wallst dot com     (PS, no one will tell me jack about why I cannot paste in any links at all)
2276 2018-01-13 16:08:39 Does the S&P's divisor (weighted to larger stocks) have any affect on long term measures?
2277 2018-01-13 16:08:34 Stock traders typically don't like to be long stocks headed into a 3 day holiday weekend. So to see the market rally so strong on Friday shows how strong this bull run is. $SPY
2278 2018-01-13 16:08:10 Sri Lanka, Romania, Kenya are the most attractive in frontier markets, Argentina, Morocco, Egypt, the least. 5 top stocks - BGEO (Georgia), Humansoft (Kuwait), IDH (Egypt), KCB (Kenya), MHP (Ukraine)  - @Citi research
2279 2018-01-13 16:07:58 Basi mas damo kapa gani stocks da bes. Hahaha
2280 2018-01-13 16:07:23 Yea and why did stocks do that? Rich realized they had trump in their pocket and they keep reinvesting and driving stocks up.  So yes crooked trump is responsible and he will be the cause of it crashing. And just for truths stock market been going up since 2009 but its ok
2281 2018-01-13 16:07:11 When will you understand that ordinary people do not care about stocks?
2282 2018-01-13 16:06:45 Nope. I have stopped writing about pot stocks for awhile since ppl hate to hear investments crash.

2284 2018-01-13 16:05:50 u mean a bull run in stocks continuing ?
2285 2018-01-13 16:05:09 So, does the interest rate paid on reserves go out and buy stocks and stuff?  Or is that part of what gets returned to treasury?
2286 2018-01-13 16:03:50 Pot stocks? Or stock pots? ;-)
2287 2018-01-13 16:02:46 Yes for sure we appreciate it. I make more on stocks than I do at work I may go full time soon.
2288 2018-01-13 16:02:23 Mohamed; how does the FED choose which securities; does it includes stocks of companies like GE; how do they avoid the criticism of picking winners and losers.  @EmilyGorcenski
2289 2018-01-13 16:01:54 Fake News!
Many stocks are owned by average Americans who invest money into 401Ks and retirement plans.
2290 2018-01-13 16:01:44 Com'on people, its a "shit-hole" some of us really stay in.  Before you demand apologies, make home better than theirs.  If UK, SA or other civilized countries want apologies, its understandable.  Empty egoism only makes us better laughing-stocks
2291 2018-01-13 16:00:18 @IFTTT I have asked several times for help with the Stocks applet.  It will not accept any ticker symbols
2292 2018-01-13 16:00:00 You are dillusional.  You must not have a 401k or stocks.  I started making great gains on November 8, 2016. #maga
2293 2018-01-13 15:59:50 Stocks are never a gamble if you invest long term and wisely
2294 2018-01-13 15:58:59 Ha ha ha yes, I'm sure you have millions invested in stocks. So wonderful for you that the leftover economy is rising with no reason. That bubble is going to burst and it's going to be bank bailouts again. This time for commercial property.
2295 2018-01-13 15:58:30 The Fed isn’t forcing them to buy stocks. Their clients are

2297 2018-01-13 15:57:44 Walmart and Carrier are laying off employees!  Majority of Americans do not own stocks but nice try.  Tax cuts are for you and your circus.

2299 2018-01-13 15:57:15 Good luck with those stocks. Much better opportunities out there. Twitter is up 4% since the new year, you call that on fire? Lol stocks such a Boeing are the real fire stocks. Up 14% so far this year after being up 100% last year, that's 
2300 2018-01-13 15:57:07 Trust me when I saw by the time I’m 30 my retirement plan and stocks will be up

2304 2018-01-13 15:54:06 The author of the story -- but can stocks possibly climb any higher?
2305 2018-01-13 15:53:39 @zerodhaonline i am not able to see any holdings at all... in kite.zerodha. I had taken more tha 6 stocks over 2 months. Help me please.
2306 2018-01-13 15:53:31 That's because most companies have investment people who put the 401K money into stocks.
2307 2018-01-13 15:52:11 2018 is all about finding new ways to create passive income. I play with stocks, but looking for new ideas. How do you do it? Blogs, did you write a book? Speak and educate! #passiveincome #2018IsHere
2308 2018-01-13 15:51:26 What's the difference between penny stock pump and dumpers and these cryptocoin schemers?

Serious question, I say nothing

There are penny stocks that rip 100% every day too

What's the difference? And what real value are they creating?
2309 2018-01-13 15:50:11 The porn star is even denying it. This is a witch hunt! People are doing whatever they can to get this man out of office. It’s weird tho ... look at the economy... if you have 401ks. Pensions, stocks, and other investments you are making alotttt of money with this president!
2310 2018-01-13 15:49:00 Stocks, nagiinvest kami ni @NotTheRealMarki ngayon. Sama ka sa "ALI" liga namin hahaha
2311 2018-01-13 15:48:33 Show me where I said if done right with 401ks...I think I was talking about buying stocks.  Two separate things.  You can pit stop losses on stocks you buy, you can’t in a 401k

2313 2018-01-13 15:45:47 Not true. You just have to learn to not puke your stocks at the bottom and lighten up on stocks at highs like now.
2314 2018-01-13 15:45:40 Document released of 11 Counts of Bribery and Fraud all about #UraniumOne. Corruption of DOJ & FBI spying on a Presidential Candidate all broke yesterday. Ever wonder why Tricky Dicky Durbin disclosed talking points of a private meeting with bad words? Liberals r laughing Stocks
2315 2018-01-13 15:44:39 I am working on being more informed and much more patient before get too opinionated. This goes for everything. Stocks. People. Politics. Media etc.  It is already helping.

2317 2018-01-13 15:43:44 Target shooting and fun. That's all. I would be fine with a bill that says, bump stocks are banned. But the ones out now are just took vague. All you need is a one page bill. I would support that all day.
2318 2018-01-13 15:42:09 Is there any legitimate reason for bump stocks to be sold to the public?
2319 2018-01-13 15:41:28 Beeing in the street is the proof of #DGB is the greatest.
2320 2018-01-13 15:41:08 I’m assuming you don’t have any stocks?
2321 2018-01-13 15:40:20 It's starting 2 go back the way it was before #OBAMANATION!

Period.
That's y I always keep my stocks up!!
1 never knows
2322 2018-01-13 15:39:59 Bump stocks aren't really a problem. Twitter is hard to explain it. That said, I wouldn't mind them being regulated. The huge problem exists in the wording though. The current bills that are being put forth will not just ban bump stocks but will ban aftermarket triggers, ...
2323 2018-01-13 15:39:08 So they help push gangsta rap ..they had stocks in music and private prisons? Wow...
2324 2018-01-13 15:38:50 @AT09_Trader for your next blog:
There are stocks ripping out of the gate and others stuffing. When you create your plan, do you plan for both cases or you just avoid it in case it didn't do what u were expecting?
2325 2018-01-13 15:38:48 Well lucky you that you can afford stocks. Some of us are struggling just to get by and can't afford to put money in something unstable as stocks currently.
2326 2018-01-13 15:37:56 Gov't soldiers are busy selling the stocks they now dispose n slaughtering cattle n birds as conquest booty#MANYU
2327 2018-01-13 15:35:46 Thankfully he didn’t know mishandling bump stocks would jam his guns like they did. Moron dies & we want to know thoughts of said moron? I guess his motive he’d claim to be some baseless conspiracy he bought from some political spin-master.
2328 2018-01-13 15:34:24 Once again, Sam’s Club is closing 63 stores. Thousands of job are being lost. Macy’s will still be closing more stores. The list goes on. These people don’t own stocks, they don’t have 6 months of living expenses sitting in their savings. They won’t have...

2331 2018-01-13 15:33:13 I bought food from Whole Foods for the first time yesterday and it was a life altering experience. Soon as i stepped in the store my skin lightened, credit score went to 800, I had a portfolio in successful stocks, and the cops in the store even told me good day sir.
2332 2018-01-13 15:33:06 The CSA released a PR last night stating they are reconsidering their policy with US Cannabis stocks and if it remains appropriate.  If there is a chance it gets delisted, I hope these stocks tank first. I would love to buy shares of them before delisting! The perfect trade!
2333 2018-01-13 15:33:04 True, real bond yields are modest, but the downside on high-quality bonds is still far smaller than the downside on stocks.
2334 2018-01-13 15:32:53 Few companies are using it to boost their stocks.
2335 2018-01-13 15:32:14 Veall makes the stocks defense look like holograms as he strolls over under the posts from halfway. What is he doing playing in this league
2336 2018-01-13 15:31:30 @vladstocks also, what’s your opinion on options trading vs just buying regular stocks?
2337 2018-01-13 15:30:27 Funny how the uncomfortable trades are the winners and the sure things are the losers. #trading #stocks $SPY
2338 2018-01-13 15:30:00 it seems $int has a better #premiummargin than $las, #insurance #stocks in #Nigeria - 31.5% former & 19.6% the latter
2339 2018-01-13 15:29:47 #Stocks rising and so are #gasprices!  High gas prices always affects the poor. Stocks don't matter cause they can't afford anyway. Rich live off of dividends so they're not affected by rising gas prices.
2340 2018-01-13 15:29:25 The technical sets ups of certain stocks (AUY, BTG, WPM) look better than GDX imo.

2345 2018-01-13 15:27:12 The interest in crypto is a good sign for stocks.... Millennials are coming off the sidelines and taking an active role in markets. 

Moves in stocks and crypto both speak to (a) more disposable income, (b) job security, (c) stronger economy, and (d) increasing appetite for risk.
2346 2018-01-13 15:26:34 It’s idiots like them that makes me want to see public stocks because it would be so nice to spend ten minutes pelting them with rotting fruit
2347 2018-01-13 15:26:09 $int & $las are both #parvalue #insurance stocks that have #dividends providing #yields of 5-6%, shouldn't this move their price?
2348 2018-01-13 15:25:58 Maybe totally unrelated but how do you follow all these cryptos on the Apple Stocks app?
2349 2018-01-13 15:25:45 Starting to study stocks that’s where it’s really at 
2350 2018-01-13 15:25:44 Thanks man! I think US financials R poised 4 a nice run. Just thinking a broad based ETF (or 4-5 indiv. stocks) Any low-cost recommendation?
2351 2018-01-13 15:24:53 You can buy penny stocks like crypto currency.
2352 2018-01-13 15:24:07 ...especially if they were in some stocks, and one had a generous supply of rotten fruit handy.

2358 2018-01-13 15:19:20 I watched the video... I get the point, but bear in mind I've made more money in crypto and faster than I ever did in stocks... and millennials aren't very interested in stocks. They are very interested in cryptocurrencies however so there could be a fundamental shift underway.

2361 2018-01-13 15:16:20 I love Boing. But there is room for both stocks and crypto in a portfolio. Especially when you need on one side a dividend farm stability and on the other side Ripple coin alone is up 22,400%
2362 2018-01-13 15:16:02 I had a sell target for my stocks based on gains set under the old tax code. Reached it yesterday. Must recalibrate higher for new tax code.

2366 2018-01-13 15:13:58 The whole point of the video is that looking at PE values and calling stocks overvalued is not a valuable way to guess the direction of the market
2367 2018-01-13 15:13:38 Stocks are about to crash.
2368 2018-01-13 15:13:25 I rarely trade stocks under $5 but there is no real rule. I filter for volume and mkt cap minimums so I generally avoid low $ stocks just because of that.
2369 2018-01-13 15:12:15 The bump stocks also caused his guns to jam which bump stocks notoriously do (Just YouTube It). Thankfully this monster had no skill in clearing his now jammed weapons. @PeteHegseth Mixed emotions on the last round for himself not jamming.
2370 2018-01-13 15:12:04 The key imponderable of 2018 is whether stocks are entering an acceleration phase or this is a classic "throw over" which tends to occur at the end of an advance (last seen in bonds in summer 2016). We are betting on the latter.
2371 2018-01-13 15:11:25 Stocks: Made $4.00 over the past month.

Cryptocurrency: Made $290 in the last two minutes.
2372 2018-01-13 15:11:15 Oh, turns out bass stocks are indeed v low so bass fishing is restricted.
I get that it hurts to throw them back if you catch them by accident, but if you were allowed to land them, wouldn't there be a load of other boats catching them by "accident".  And then no more bass? :-(
2373 2018-01-13 15:10:42 And it is all worthless unless they pull the money out and then stocks go down.
2374 2018-01-13 15:10:01 The ball is now clearly too soft. Stocks kick the ball backwards into to touch 5m behind themselves
2375 2018-01-13 15:09:20 No surprises there and hypothesis in order. To invest in the stocks needs dedicated focus to make decisions. It’s not a straight line investment and riding the tides requires focus.

2378 2018-01-13 15:07:55 I don't use RSI so I'm sorry I can't answer But the number of stocks making new highs is not random.
2379 2018-01-13 15:07:40 Honestly our line out is woeful. Great opportunity blown in the stocks 22
2380 2018-01-13 15:07:32 Many people don’t have the resources or money to but stocks. It’s not a matter of not wanting to or not know how, it’s a matter of no discretionary income
2381 2018-01-13 15:07:14 @AlexanderFisher stocks have been overvalued for a while... anything happens to the presidency... i.e. real calls for impeachment or impeachment proceedings and expect 30% haircut. Not healthy market when handful of names carry most of market forward. Crypto is the place to be!

2389 2018-01-13 14:58:19 If your facts are true unfortunately I have to agree with you it would be nice if we could all own stocks
2390 2018-01-13 14:57:07 If most of the people who own stocks are rich, then perhaps you should get a clue and buy more stock. You know, since you've already admitted that stocks make people rich.
2391 2018-01-13 14:56:52 Wait, we own stocks and have made a ton of money. We are middle class. You don't need millions to invest in stock!! This is a stereotype that is completely unfounded. Trump is making Americans prosper again. ALL Americans.

2397 2018-01-13 14:51:55 Years ago— maybe 45— Taylor Caldwell wrote a novel about the global elite, people that manipulate everything from stocks to wars. Not a new idea.
2398 2018-01-13 14:51:52 Nice...!
Don't be alarmed people but after a year of steadily raising...the 'market' is due for a 'correction'.
Some stocks will dip momentarily...
Soros will attempt 'panic'...
Liberals will be yelling "...the sky is falling"
Don't worry ...stocks will rebound quickly.

2404 2018-01-13 14:48:43 I just wanna know how I start out with a condo with a basketball court DIRECTLY next to a basketball facility in @NBA2K 18. Like did DJ dabble in stocks? Did he win the lottery? Were his DJ skills really that good? So many questions
2405 2018-01-13 14:48:23 we produce to much food because of Chicago and Hamburg playing with live stocks and making prices higher for speculations on food security

2407 2018-01-13 14:45:19 Most stocks are owned by Americans in their retirement accounts. Look at any stock symbol and examine the % of institutional ownership. That's the portion primary in people's retirement accounts, not private investors accounts.

Thank u so much for all Ur efforts for Ur advices Nd guidance on the stocks ....
2410 2018-01-13 14:44:22 For some reason we chose not to take an easy 3 points. Stocks then win a penalty on their own line
2411 2018-01-13 14:43:08 Massive move coming in gold stocks and prob silver. DO NOT TRADE IT - because you will leave huge amounts of $ on table
2412 2018-01-13 14:43:06 I might need to invest in some amazon stocks
2413 2018-01-13 14:42:57 Yup and my statements prove it! You can say and provide what ever you want. Stock market has been at record highs consistently all year. The money I have made on my stocks this last year is all the proof I need. Cash in my pocket and loving it!!!

2418 2018-01-13 14:38:22 Asking ALL dems/liberals....how many of you have stocks in the stock market right now? How many just got a bonus from your company due to the tax cut? Yeah....so STFU and SIT DOWN.@Alyssa_Milano. Too bad you don't have any no ey to invest!! You could pay your tax bill!!

2422 2018-01-13 14:36:27 Over turn the new tax law. It must be done! It is going to cripple our economy. Don’t let them kid us. They started killing jobs and buying their own stocks. This takes money OUT of the circulation.
2423 2018-01-13 14:36:13 Plenty amount of investors and analyst believe that earnings growth and US economic expansion would keep pushing stocks uo this year; not even half a month in the S&P has jump more than 4.00% for the year.

The outlook looks good, but for how long.....? “Earning will tell”

2424 2018-01-13 14:36:07 Dispite USD/JPY failing to step higher Gold Mining Stocks in general don’t look as bullish as i would expect them to be.
2425 2018-01-13 14:35:44 Try being disabled and living on $1000 a month.  I can really afford stocks.  Shit, I can barely afford SOCKS.

2427 2018-01-13 14:33:53 If you are new in the stock market (last 3 years) - I will not blame you if you think that stocks only go up
2428 2018-01-13 14:33:20 Alright, even if it is a fact working is the worst way to make money, your limited to what you can earn a year. Investing in stocks isn’t the only form of investing either you can always invest in CDS too or buy property.

2432 2018-01-13 14:31:38 Yes, multiple triggers in this company backed by the up cycle of the Steel sector...this can give returns like Upper Ganges, Dwarikesh etc. sugar stocks during sugar up cycles...they became 20 times...:)
2433 2018-01-13 14:31:32 Cryptos are a free market. Compare to stocks/futures, u can see the difference in price movements.

2437 2018-01-13 14:28:52 NOW CLEAR
2438 2018-01-13 14:28:50 Yes, the Dow gains (of which fewer than 1% of Americans have any ownership of Dow stocks) is worth less because of Dollar weakness.

Rather think store of value, #gold,  #stocks. 

Crypto now at $0.7T. It is over valued in the ST but under valued LT -> Blackrock ~$6T AuM, World’s gold reserves ~$8T, European stocks ~$8T #fintech

2445 2018-01-13 14:26:58 My grandmother was great with stocks and gave us slices from her portfolio. It's diverse and nothing seemed awful except the Comcast, which I sold because I hate them so much.

2447 2018-01-13 14:26:29 I guess most people buy a few stocks here and there, but they can buy index tracking instruments too. Most small investors don’t, but they could.

2449 2018-01-13 14:25:22 Average #Trumpkin: WOO HOO! Dow is up!

What’s the Dow?

AT: Um, stocks n such?

So you have a large portfolio? So this benefits you?

AT: A large what now? I ain’t got money fer stocks. Walmart pays 8 an hour!

Ah. So this means what for you?

AT: Uh....#MAGA!! Wooooooo! 


2450 2018-01-13 14:25:21 Moral superiority is something that the Democrats have been hunting for since 2016. But sh*tholes isn't getting it. Obama/Libya anyone? 
No. Stop endlessly ripping at @realDonaldTrump and report the truth! Stocks/jobs/tax cuts!
2451 2018-01-13 14:25:12 As @Vegas keeps its tech show during the weekend one remainder is clear self deiving cars are here to stay, and its technology with companies like $AMD & $NVDA would push this stocks up for years to come.

2452 2018-01-13 14:24:52 "Global stocks now worth $84.2tn, equals to 110% of global GDP" Voila voila
2453 2018-01-13 14:24:30 For the avg investor the large pizza is probably about right for walmart dividends alone, but the key is to hope more of your stocks benefit. Then its 1000 large pizzas. My point is that its not just rich dudes that own corporations. It is also middle class Americans like me.
2454 2018-01-13 14:24:29 You need to include Ag stocks!  Remember when Moscow had wildfires and heatwaves about 6, 7 years ago?  What's ahead will be much worse.  Guaranteed now, unfortunately.  MOO and RJA may be good picks.
2455 2018-01-13 14:23:49 If someone stated that stocks would crash if Trump won really doesn't understand the Republican party who is about the rich.  The lower/middle class may get some crumbs for a couple of years to make it look good. Then, greed and selfishness take over.
2456 2018-01-13 14:23:02 Ojalá, pero es buena señal que los stocks se queden vacíos eso quiere decir que está vendiendo bien
2457 2018-01-13 14:21:58 As an investor, your merchandise is stocks. Your objective is to buy shares that are in strong demand and sell them at a higher price. @markminervini
2458 2018-01-13 14:21:45 Every time you mention the stock market and how well it's doing, I think to myself how glad I am I have so much money invested in stocks. 

Oh. Right. 

Never mind, I forgot. I don't have shit in stocks.

2461 2018-01-13 14:21:25 His degree isn't relevant. His football career is also irrelevant. You don't have to have a degree in finances to understand stocks and crypto. You don't even need a college education. You sound bitter for no reason at all
2462 2018-01-13 14:21:22 Very interested in the training / learning content. The stock market in general should be bullish until election season with the changes coming into place- what do you think of traditional stocks?
2463 2018-01-13 14:21:12 stocks never go down from my experience -said millennials everywhere
2464 2018-01-13 14:20:43 Jobs up! Unemployment down! Stocks at record levels! Border crossings way down! Isis disappearing! Hmmm! The left wants, baby killing, terrorist, entitlement etc! Trump is president for such a time as this! Move to California demo dummies!

2470 2018-01-13 14:17:18 a bear market just drops stocks to 15-hour lows nowadays
2471 2018-01-13 14:15:05 When you're a billionaire, stocks aren't a gamble, they're just part of your investment strategy (managed by a third party so you never even have to think about it) and cast a broad enough net that you'll always profit. That's not the experience 90% of Americans have with stocks.
2472 2018-01-13 14:15:02 Honeywell, Skye Bank, Champion Breweries, 63 other stocks spur market’s growth - BusinessDay : News you can trust -
2473 2018-01-13 14:14:29 Back in 1915 ,During WWI, Death from starvation had become commonplace in Damascus.The famine was caused by Turks conficating all wheat & barley stocks and all that was eaten to feed their soldiers.Patriarch Gregorios Haddad at the time had all the properties of the Church sold.
2474 2018-01-13 14:14:02 LOW paying jobs are coming to America, which helps no one. Raise minimum wage to $15 an hour so people can survive. And stocks mean nothing to the average working person because they cannot afford to invest.
2475 2018-01-13 14:13:53 Being a illegal in this country is not a club. It’ against the freaking law. Hey Chuck, Nancy try paying attention while trying not to get caught looking at the ticker tape to see how much your stocks are going up. I know that you are watching @FoxBusiness and counting your $
2476 2018-01-13 14:13:33 obamas stocks have skyrocketed because of trump
2477 2018-01-13 14:13:11 WHITE PARTY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2478 2018-01-13 14:12:56 Let’s say his “buddies” were to own stocks, which they probably do. Stocks are a gamble and just like they can gain money they can lose money. Also anyone can buy a stock or sell a stock, we shouldn’t just complain because certain people don’t know how to use stocks and don’t buy
2479 2018-01-13 14:12:38 That's awesome for the 10% of Americans who own 80% of the stocks.  50% of Americans own NO stocks at all!  I'm sure Walmart has done great after closing 63 stores with NO warning to their workers.
2480 2018-01-13 14:12:23 I know you keep hyping the stock market, Donald but again remind you that only 14 percent of Americans own individual stocks and half of America is essentially left out by not having any money invested at all.

2484 2018-01-13 14:09:11 If average Americans were seeing any benefits from the stock market boom, you wouldn’t have to go on Twitter every five minutes to brag about how awesome it is. Also, I just learned roughly 25% of stocks are owned by FOREIGNERS! So much for MAGA.
2485 2018-01-13 14:08:24 Guess why? Jobs. Low unemployment brings exponential influx of $$ to stocks market. Every $day $M are dumped into 401K, IRA, retirement plans which leads to more business investment, higher wages, and an explosively growing economy. Damned that #trickledown God Bless @POTUS #maga

2492 2018-01-13 14:05:33 More jobs are being lost than “coming back” and you know it! Most people don’t give a sh*t about the stock market. Your cult pretends to, but don’t even know what stocks are. They cheer because you tell them it’s good.

The were in steep decline at the time she died.

2525 2018-01-13 13:45:32 My late mother was a lifelong Democrat from a family of lifelong Democrats.

Yet, I'm sure she'd thank Trump for the increased value of  the stocks she had invested in.

2526 2018-01-13 13:45:16 Thanks Obama! You laid the foundation and stabilized the markets. You created job growth, dropped the unemployment rate, and stocks were gaining. Great job! Smart people know it has nothing to do with Trump.
2527 2018-01-13 13:44:37 Trying to track down your whisky cream sauce in London to no avail. Used to be stocked in Waitrose but not any more. Who now stocks this in London? @MacsweenHaggis

2529 2018-01-13 13:43:55 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of Americans. Your constant boasting about the stock market (thanks Obama) shows how few positive things you have to say about your disgraceful Presidency, and how out of touch you are. Stocks matter to your buddies, not most Americans.
2530 2018-01-13 13:43:25 Er... fake news. Fish stocks have revived as a consequence of EU policy.
2531 2018-01-13 13:42:50 IMHO gold will continue higher with no pullbacks just like stocks did in 2017. Traders expecting a PB to get in will be forced to chase by these Algos.
2532 2018-01-13 13:42:40 If he puts 90% of of the $282 million in stocks and real estate he could spend more than that, a 2% yearly return would equal $15 000 a day. :)
2533 2018-01-13 13:42:18 Thanks curry guy it wasn’t so much portion size   It was an alternative for base stocks so I can knock one up without the base stock  I know it kinds of defeats purpose but thogjtvwld ask.

The esteemed Barron’s Roundtable expects “more of the same for stocks.” “It’s similar to the Eisenhower administration synchronized growth.” A drug test for this group should be mandatory...

2542 2018-01-13 13:35:16 Well, stocks are the aggressive, riskier aspect that also includes mutual fund and lots of bonds, which are safer and less volatile.
Watch that bubble, remember history.
2543 2018-01-13 13:34:18 AT&T, Sam's (Wal-Mart), Carrier cutting THOUSANDS of jobs.  Coal mines and small businesses closing.... Now tell me again about all those new jobs...
NEWS FLASH! MOST Americans aren't involved in the stock market, and the top 20% of wealthy Americans own 82% of the stocks.

2565 2018-01-13 13:19:25 My 401k and stocks made slow and steady gains and losses in the last 8 years. Nothing to sneeze at! Just this year alone my stocks have sky rocketed to the point that I can live off the interest! 2009 is a complete wash! I see as many, a profitable future! FINALLY!
2566 2018-01-13 13:19:19 10,000 low I come folks laid off from Walmart you idiot. 63 stores closed. Carrier laid off 1000, ATT laid off folks. The list goes on. Btw: most of these folks don’t own stocks.
2567 2018-01-13 13:19:18 the stock market means nothing when most people are too poor to own stocks because wages haven't meaningfully increased in 50 years

Very few of us own stocks, it is not a healthy economic barometer to most of us.

2588 2018-01-13 12:59:20 For the first time ever in its almost 90-year history, the S&P 500 rose every month in 2017. Historically there have only been four years with gains in 11 months of the year. #stocks
2589 2018-01-13 12:58:44 when stocks are euphoric and investors are greedy and fearful, that is when SPs and valuations are way too stretched. you may not be getting the best value for your money. Once story is more proven, valuations may still be stretched. Outside MMJs,BTCs,other bizs,gold,oil mayBEit.
2590 2018-01-13 12:56:18 If a farm is worth +$10M, and subject to estate tax, seems like it'd be pretty easy to monetize the portion due in taxes by selling a couple acres. The same problem exists for someone inheriting a portfolio of bonds/stocks.
2591 2018-01-13 12:56:00 @DylanPlayfair  What other stocks are you holding at the moment?
2592 2018-01-13 12:55:58 when stocks are sleepy, you may find best value and may well have better valuations going forward even though SPs dont go parabolic, eventually markets will reward investors calmly up.

2653 2018-01-13 11:58:39 See this got me thinking about how we're aware of bad things going on, like fish stocks declining and bees dying out and how these are terrible environment-destroyonf things but we're just hurtling towards the apocalypse
2654 2018-01-13 11:57:23 Vanguard SRI Global tracks the Dev World Index with screening / SRI overlay. Cheap but the screen is fairly light touch. Mostly US stocks.
2655 2018-01-13 11:52:26 Declining fish stocks due to overfishing
2656 2018-01-13 11:49:18 do you agree  with your brother Chris that Churchill was responsible for the deaths of millions in the Bengal Famine of 1943 after he took away their food stocks ?

2659 2018-01-13 11:46:38 Are you in Europe? I am. We are laughing stocks.Norway, Netherlands, Germany. U.K. all the goodwill we've earned is puss in away. Because shithole trump can't be civil
2660 2018-01-13 11:42:59 How could Defaulters have hatched conspiracy if not for JShah led having roped them in to loot public money. You had STOCKS.
2661 2018-01-13 11:41:47 １日で3 #ELLA 掘れたが、stocks exchangeに１日たっても届かない。面倒だったからテキトーに選んだのが失敗だったか。
2662 2018-01-13 11:40:03 LADIES we have 50% OFF on ALL Tara, Lily Originals & Capri whilst stocks last!! hurry DON'T miss your chance!!
2663 2018-01-13 11:36:41 Any possible target in short term  -thanks
2664 2018-01-13 11:36:21 "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient." This usually applies not only to stocks, but all markets (crypto including) 
2665 2018-01-13 11:35:49 It is decimating our fish stocks. They need protection.
2666 2018-01-13 11:35:21 Amber - Looking at your bullish potential for ITC. I also added it on my watch list last week. I was searching for best performing global stocks in the inflationary 70s. Surprise - besides the commodity stocks cigarettes topped the list. Coincidence?
2667 2018-01-13 11:33:49 pues claro, en USA todos operan hasi, sea stocks,futuros,cryptos. Solo con velas es muy dificil sentir el flow del mercado.

2670 2018-01-13 11:27:13 So a steady decline is what I see. But the stock market is 100% Trump. Of that there's no doubt. That shit changes on a dime. But the S&P is the better marketr. 500 stocks as apposed to 30 in the Dow. S&P also very strong under Trump too.
2671 2018-01-13 11:26:17 That is fantastic news for the wealthiest 10% of Americans who own 94% of the stocks. How about the people who work for a living? Anything on the horizon for us? Infrastructure? Healthcare?
2672 2018-01-13 11:24:44 And he is still trying to protect and better the country for all Americans. STOCKS UP , UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN AND PEOPLE ARE STILL COMPLAINING.STUPID!
GOD BLESS PRES TRUMP

2678 2018-01-13 11:16:18 What concerns me always about this debate, Philip, is that no mention is ever made of the millions of wild ruminants displaced by growth of human agri activity, and that should we abandon livestock production those original stocks may well burgeon again.
2679 2018-01-13 11:12:59 Just because cryptos don’t have a central bank that you can force to buy mooooaaarrr stocks, Mr. Munich? 
2680 2018-01-13 11:12:33 Investments are doing pretty well, historically speaking! But my vague understanding is that after the financial crisis USS moved heavily from stocks (which have done great since) to bonds and gilts (which haven’t).

2682 2018-01-13 11:09:09 why? Why don't Banks let out 1000% profit making stocks? #shahrukhjatoi #BTMindrush18 #BhimaKoregaon Banks stocking these profits & stocks is what has led to such fake Census highs.
2683 2018-01-13 11:08:04 I got given some for free as a work gift and it's about as anxiety inducing as trading stocks is if you have a heart

2687 2018-01-13 11:01:51 @Homebase_uk I just wanted to pass on my disappointment that my local Homebase no longer stocks things such as bedding, cushions and photo frames. Boo.
2688 2018-01-13 11:01:40 #hatecrime #NZvPAK #Brahmastra #BTS #BTMindRush18 they say all these to hide profits they make from Stocks. Funds are madeup of most Falling stocks hence as a fund the profits of rising stocks gets hidden being a collective fund. This is a fraud since Funds made by same co's.

2691 2018-01-13 10:58:47 That why you buy when it's under a penny and wait till it hits $10 and pay your mortgage off and quit your job. Crypto is not stocks it us not USD they aren't make more of each type. I don't see stocks riding 7000% in 2 days literally yanking ppl from poverty
2692 2018-01-13 10:55:56 Hobby, living, makes little difference. U r still contributing to the depletion of fish stocks. Which is not only wrecking marine Eco systems but also encouraging others to illegally fish in protected waters. And all the time your industry try’s to increase fish consumption.

Oh.....wait, what??
2712 2018-01-13 10:20:36 The reason for this is that the Norwegian government&people have been both lucky&wise. Oil&gas reserves were found (lucky) but they managed them well,invested many in funds,bonds,stocks,gold etc and spread the wealth, without overspending,among its people (wise) #Norway
2713 2018-01-13 10:19:25 I need to talk to someone about stocks and shares

2720 2018-01-13 10:10:57 Less countries fishing will allow for the stocks to increase over time. I know British fishermen have always taken care not to over fish! The problem lies with the French who will take anything back home, small lobster et al, and that will stop!
2721 2018-01-13 10:10:37 They better go slow, oversupply of coins forcing exchange at discount ;)

2724 2018-01-13 10:09:02 Sure. I get that you can't tell which fish are going to come up in the net. I was just wondering what rule it was that was making you throw them back?
Are bass stocks in danger and fishing being restricted, or something?
2725 2018-01-13 10:07:39 Never cared for a man who hoards wealth. It's greedy and selfish, I would reinvest a huge portion of. That 75 billion or so in job creation. Instead of buying depressed businesses and stocks. And hoarding the wealth..

2727 2018-01-13 10:00:59 Looking forward for Telegram's ico.
If you have some spare money, you should buy some gram during this ICO..
It has a big chance to be equivalent of buying google stocks at its IPO..
ICO: first chance you have to buy a cryptocoin
IPO: first chance you have to buy a share.
2728 2018-01-13 09:59:27 Everybody running behind Hot stocks to make quick money,but U can make more money by keeping cold stocks .
2729 2018-01-13 09:55:25 Gold and Stocks don't really to go parallel.  One or the other is not right.

2742 2018-01-13 09:33:51 I did say they should buy up Channel 10 when the stocks were falling but there are plenty of opportunities for them in Media just need to think laterally. Maybe David you could write a piece controlling Media in Australia using Super Money.
2743 2018-01-13 09:32:04 Of course! We look at our 401K & other stocks and our smiles are from ear to ear. How are yours doing?

2745 2018-01-13 09:28:31 Great in theory but be wary of this label. Fisheries pay to become members so it's been given to some of the most unsustainable stocks in the world (orange roughy, swordfish, tuna, shark & krill) Potentially more damaging than good. Not to be confused with the brilliant @mcsuk!

2748 2018-01-13 09:22:31 The correlation between the US wheat price and US end stocks is give or take 0. For past 10yrs your prices were shaped more by the EU bal. World wheat snds are more bearish in this WASDE but +1ma in US is not top of list of reasons IMO. EU balance changes need a mention.
2749 2018-01-13 09:20:28 Was planning to buy new pair of sunglasses for about a month or more now. I went to the department store to find out they might not re-release them again, now that stocks are out. 

Lesson learned.
When your gut tells you to buy it, buy it.
2750 2018-01-13 09:19:58 Yeah, there are several stocks where my Yield on Cost is well above 4 %, e.g. my acquisitions in 2009, 2010 and 2011: Nestle (4.9%), Roche (4.9%), Novartis (4.3%), Zurich (7.8%), Royal Dutch Shell (over 10%) and of HSBC before the Brexit Vote with YoC of 7 %.

2752 2018-01-13 09:19:25 @TheBullBull Stock moving from 4 to 5 Rs is same as stock moving from
40 to 50
400 to 500
4000 to 5000

Still why people prefer stocks below 10 Rs!? Multi bagger can be in any of abv!
2753 2018-01-13 09:19:18 Reading stocks are now replenished, mostly with low-brow horror. I know what i shall be doing today.

2790 2018-01-13 08:32:47 Think about this...stocks are valued more or less within a sovereign nation. Crypto has value anywhere in the world. $750 billion seem cheap. ( Market cap )
2791 2018-01-13 08:29:14 Economy is on the up take with added jobs, unemployment is down, stocks are up, consumer confidence the highest since 2008. My employer and my 401k are doing just fine. Keep focusing on his words and not his policies.
2792 2018-01-13 08:29:04 How long did you have those stocks for? Stocks you usually don't sell until you're ready to retire.

2818 2018-01-13 07:59:51 Seth, you are one of the main reasons that I'm even on Twitter. What you do is important.
I also think that if you own stocks in this thing you might want to bail out soon...

2820 2018-01-13 07:58:43 There are altcoins with a finite supply and not everyone who creates a crypto is a scammer.  And bitcoin is under the control of the idiots who forked it to death last year, don’t kid yourself.  And to say that stocks have risk and bitcoin doesn’t is wrong.
2821 2018-01-13 07:55:25 It's much harder for kids to buy stocks.
2822 2018-01-13 07:54:50 The company's he mentioned so far are not public listed on nasdaq or NYSE.  He said he can't say who until they do because stocks run on news..
2823 2018-01-13 07:53:59 Our Vanity hub will be closed for a couple of days. We need time to fix and organize our stocks for our new partnership. Date TBA.
2824 2018-01-13 07:51:08 Exactly my point! Look it in % terms and not absolute amt. Have to blame TV channels as well. They bring stocks on screen when it moves 400 to 500 and not 4 to 5.!
2825 2018-01-13 07:49:36 One can predict stocks with certain degree of certainty and even #bitcoin price with a little certainty, but not @imVkohli ‘s playing XI ;) 34 different playing XI in all of his 34 test matches as captain. @klrahul11 rightly gets in.

2827 2018-01-13 07:49:18 Yup, glad that you shared your view on it. It's a pretty common scenario with penny stocks. I don't mind risking on it, but please share further updates you get on this scrip if possible. Your blog is really amazing, appreciate it

2835 2018-01-13 07:39:26 Don't look at stocks as if a single fish (opportunity) you got to catch. Look at them as a pond filled with fishes. You will then realize you can catch another fish if one escapes.

2854 2018-01-13 07:02:23 Yes, but most non-profits don’t have sufficient resources to buy stocks. Donors sometimes donate stock and the non-profits I worked for always sold the stocks because they needed the money to operate. Could be different with large national orgs like Red Cross, etc.

2858 2018-01-13 06:55:20 Well, cryptocurrencies are not stocks. Also, they will not "crash" because I understand sound investment strategies.
2859 2018-01-13 06:53:43 VERY WRONG! 
All shitcoins can be replicated at will by the scammers behind them, while paintings aren't liquid or divisible. Stocks are an investment with risk. None of these can work as money. Bitcoin being scarce, liquid & under the control of nobody is why it can.
2860 2018-01-13 06:53:41 i hope your stocks crash
2861 2018-01-13 06:52:53 I agree Shawn, I just look at the Stormers stocks at number 10 and it seems he'll be the starter unless Jean-Luc du Plessis is fit and firing.

2863 2018-01-13 06:51:58 Sir, you are motivating your followers to stay on top by suggesting real gems everytime . I am wondered how can you suggest such stocks which will go up after your recommendation

2868 2018-01-13 06:41:02 Still no one? The definition of the word is: Something that one owns, especially stocks and bonds.
2869 2018-01-13 06:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2870 2018-01-13 06:39:44 Stocks on the rise
2871 2018-01-13 06:37:22 America has lost it's respect from the political elites buying their every whim & having the ability to out maneuver any law they wish while making up whatever new ones suit their fancy. Stenchboy, Kilgore, & crew were and still are the laughing stocks around the world.
2872 2018-01-13 06:37:07 People want to do all research when they open a shop somewhere. But in stocks they want weekly doublers cheap (by price) and without any study/homework. 

An investor truely arrives when he is able to differentiate beteeen cheap by price and cheap by value.
2873 2018-01-13 06:30:20  i love to read about stocks and real estate.

2874 2018-01-13 06:29:28 We don't use Sammy Sosa cards as base pair when valuing stocks, bonds, currencies... Gold, silver, platinum have uses other than medium of exchange+collectible; crypto doesn't. A pure collectible is a poor unit of account.

2876 2018-01-13 06:28:03 Many people will give you buying ideas on stocks (including me) but please calculate the risk & capital size before getting into trade. Specially when trading in F&O. "No Loss" trade is first part of profit.
2877 2018-01-13 06:24:12 I think the Russian oligarchs are selling their stocks to create the down-tick in share prices.

2879 2018-01-13 06:21:29 I'd agree if not for the "round number" psych level of $1.00 failing so easily in this case, plus MACD rolled over. And markets generally so overbought, so too #lithium stocks. With either style though, we'd be talking about ~ 15% risk. Discipline to actually stop out is key!

2888 2018-01-13 06:12:32 Learn machine learning and big data or invest in lucrative crypto currencies or trade stocks/do algo trades on spread arbitrages
2889 2018-01-13 06:11:43 My logic is that if I have money to invest, I'd rather pay off my house sooner which is a guaranteed gain, or invest in stocks which have a longer history of providing long term gains. Again, not saying avoid crypto completely, but consider all your options.

2894 2018-01-13 06:06:12 Maybe bump stocks are a bad idea - but we probably can’t talk about that because the Republicans are co-owned by the @nra and @Fox is an arm of the Republican/Russian Party

2922 2018-01-13 05:34:04 #FBI documents on #StephenPaddock seem to show communication with an unknown e-mail account advertising weapons sales. Specifically mentioned bump fire stocks. Goes well with the arms dealer theory.
2923 2018-01-13 05:34:03 Thanks to Jeff Sessions for declaring his negative position on marijuana, and Donald Trump for threatening to pull out of NAFTA, cannabis stocks are now much cheaper for any late buyers looking for the right moment to get it on this huge opportunity #AuroraCannabis #ACB #TSX 
2924 2018-01-13 05:32:41 Exactly.  Shitty bump stocks and 100-rd mags range toys are only a headline-earning play.
2925 2018-01-13 05:27:44 I’m lowkey pissed I don’t know anything about stocks. Even though I’m not smart enough to get into it, I just want to know what it is
2926 2018-01-13 05:24:25 At least 5 diff stories in my feed over last 10 min saying some version of "stocks are overvalued," "market pullback is imminent," etc. Because it's a day that ends in Y. Same people writing same story for like a decade - they missed their real calling of being a broken clock.
2927 2018-01-13 05:23:16 One of my stocks went up 40% today and it was literally the best part of my day.
2928 2018-01-13 05:23:02 Who cares?

How about:
Jobs report?
Consumer confidence?
Stocks?
Bonuses because of Tax Bill?

Do we allow immigration from Shithole Countries?
2929 2018-01-13 05:22:07 ANNYEONG!! PRE-ORDER for BT21 is now closed. Good news! We still have stocks left. Message us to get youuurs! 
2930 2018-01-13 05:21:55 @jonnajarian Your brother told me there would be no talk of unusuals in healthcare stocks on @HalftimeReport today.  Glad I got in $THC when I saw that paper this morning.
2931 2018-01-13 05:20:12 use repellent. wait, that's dependant on whether your shithole country stocks some. 
2932 2018-01-13 05:20:05 Oh man I hear you on that one! Someone brings up stocks and I start talking nonstop!
2933 2018-01-13 05:19:16 Gustong gusto ko pong bumili ng book 2 kaso dalawang nbs na napuntahan ko wala pa rin silang stocks. Linibot ko talaga lahat ng book section lahat ng genre ng books tiningnan ko kasi baka nahalo lang or something. Wala talaga 
2934 2018-01-13 05:18:45 Cool to see that, in addition to the usual suspects from England, Spain, Germany, Italy, etc, Rebel Sport in Australia also stocks Chapecoense kits
2935 2018-01-13 05:10:37 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2936 2018-01-13 05:10:15 Upon announcing algorithm changes to make Facebook a friend oriented, minimal news/media/advertising platform; Facebook stock plummeted 4.5% costing Zuckerberg $3billion in personal wealth. 

There's no money in peace.

2937 2018-01-13 05:10:09 So embarrassed of our president. Please just stop justifying his behavior. Please.  It is unacceptable no matter how good your stocks look.
2938 2018-01-13 05:09:21 Not my fault Stark stocks pay out well
2939 2018-01-13 05:08:53 Ticket number 11241 I deposited ETH from Poloniex to Stocks Exchange but it is not reflecting, it's been more than 10hours now. Please help I am frustrated.
2940 2018-01-13 05:05:46 Her husband make that money investing in stocks. It is amazing what you can learn from a little research and reading
2941 2018-01-13 05:02:42 Ever wanted to invest your money in stocks etc but you don’t know where to start?? You know it’s an app for that.. I can send you the link and a video that explains it!! 
2942 2018-01-13 05:00:49 Well I gotta say that 2016 I got into stocks to simply explore and play with only a few thousands.  2017 I managed to gain 90% of my current salary!  I did not cash in as I am waiting for the bigger wins in 2018!
2943 2018-01-13 05:00:14 Lmao the random hate one trump but yet he is massively improving nearly everything. My stocks and work are loving it. $$$
2944 2018-01-13 04:56:58 Part 2/2. Stocks you typically trade have a huge daily ATR. If you take big size as a newbie you can lose your shorts very (quickly) and if it goes your way it will be a huge payday. That explains in my mind why you insist the 80/20 rule and insist cashing out, and don’t gamble.
2945 2018-01-13 04:56:43 @zerodhaonline is there any feature to create group of my holding stocks as per my preference. Currently we  have only kite and smallcase as categories. Can this be customized to add my new category there .
2946 2018-01-13 04:56:39 Can Bighit make more stocks for the goods? ;;; I can’t even get anything when they open the sale for final concert and have to buy from other with higher price ;;;

2950 2018-01-13 04:52:48 Does anyone know where in Brisbane stocks soft footbed Birkenstocks I can try on? Everywhere I’ve been so far only has classic footbed ones.
2951 2018-01-13 04:51:56 Anything to give the "Appearance" the oil stocks are balancing/demand is healthy! Haaaaaaa LOL  Get that oil out of storage! Put it in a salt mine or turn it into gasoline!!!!  I would love to know who is really buying our exports. Do we have honest data?!? : ]
2952 2018-01-13 04:51:54 Stock buy backs increase the share price of the stock, this would increase shareholders n 401ks. Stocks aren’t owned only by rich ppl they’re also owned by hard working Americans
2953 2018-01-13 04:50:01 I hope there are stocks of 4th muster goods of the GOM that I have ordered my image picket tho

#ScaryIn4Words
2957 2018-01-13 04:46:03 Voices from the basket of deplorables beg Trump to tell Mueller to go straight to hell. Stocks plan B won't work.#DrainTheSewer
2958 2018-01-13 04:46:00 I already go an account but finding the right stocks and knowing the ups and downs and when to cash out
2959 2018-01-13 04:44:23 @play_on_verbs get into investing. Stocks won’t hurt you lol
2960 2018-01-13 04:42:08 You sound like a fascist republican fighting for tyranny of its citizens. What’s your opinion on government spying on its people 4th amendment or bump stocks turning semi to full auto gun control 2nd admendment?
2961 2018-01-13 04:41:58 But I beat you in Singles and lost like two of my stocks to SDs.
2962 2018-01-13 04:41:52 theirs no 1031 exchange equivalent for stocks/cyrptos? i know for real estate its the best option for tax defer and that's the main loophole used
2963 2018-01-13 04:38:44 There hasn't been a historically horrific shooting in awhile and my stocks (not gun stocks lol) are hurting. Come on people I need to feed and protect my family!!
2964 2018-01-13 04:37:46 Only 16% of Americans own privately held stocks. We already knew that Trump policies favored the wealthy, so no surprise here. Meanwhile, Real Americans lose healthcare, infrastructure, & safety nets. A government that catered to the rich is what led to the Great Depression.
2965 2018-01-13 04:34:09 What is the best way. For beginners in stocks I'm vary interested
2966 2018-01-13 04:33:03 Gosh I never seen 1 thing in 8 years he accomplished.  Trumps been in for 1 year and stocks are through the  roof . No attacks on our country.  Things are looking better everyday. I was not a believer in the  beginning but i am now. You need to give credit not criticism
2967 2018-01-13 04:32:58 Do you have a graphic like this that shows the percent of US equity funds that hold X number of stocks? Ie how many how 20 stocks, 50, 150, etc?
2968 2018-01-13 04:32:35 I use to want designer things. Now I just want mutual funds, bonds, stocks and a 401K. Lol I’m really growing up.
2969 2018-01-13 04:32:27 What’s tha gunz? Stocks n bond you no shit that appreciate with value..
2970 2018-01-13 04:32:23 I officially own shares with Starbucks ... its so cool how they give u stocks just for working for them 
2971 2018-01-13 04:32:17 I don’t want you not to have the right to a handgun. But don’t see why we need bump stocks, drum barrel cartridges, assault rifles etc. I’d ask you to give that up for the lives of others. Appreciate you being civil with your opinion on this though even though we likely disagree.
2972 2018-01-13 04:30:40 I can’t wait to play with stocks again
2973 2018-01-13 04:27:39 Can you get high on penny stocks?
2974 2018-01-13 04:27:06 Great. Once again I have to relearn how to use @Facebook. Every year they change it and fuck with it and my old ass has to learn the shit all over again. Prolly has something to do with falling stocks & not that bs Zuckerberg is running about making it better for us lol. Umm, no.
2975 2018-01-13 04:27:05 You see he was (probably) sending emails to himself about AR-15’s and bump stocks?!?
2976 2018-01-13 04:26:51 People who throw out terms like "bubble" usually don't apply it to currency.  Commodities, like stocks, houses, et al, are different from currency markets.  People need to really educate themselves on currency trends and how to deal with them instead of thinking like stocks.
2977 2018-01-13 04:25:45 yeeeaaahhh nami gd man ang moon nga lamp ... tani may stocks di sa iloilo
2978 2018-01-13 04:25:04 I wouldn’t use Shiller PE as a buy signal. Generally stocks do well over the long term. Only when it’s high it becomes a sell signal. 30 and higher would be a bearish signal.
2979 2018-01-13 04:24:32 I suggested learning stocks & trading to my boyfriend the other day, his serious response was we could put the same amount of energy & time into learning how to rob a bank


2980 2018-01-13 04:21:52 Will have a look mate thanks. Not a holder but know the company. With the gold price rising gold stocks may be the next sector to be in imo. Cheers 🖒
2981 2018-01-13 04:20:26 And Saudis wouldn't buy the rifles with stupid bump stocks so he went off the deep end and started shooting people.
2982 2018-01-13 04:19:52 @JasArrow23 “Nag bago na kaya stocks ng h&m” HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH tf
2983 2018-01-13 04:19:45 Doubt it. Nothing meaningful has been fixed. Stocks can go up, but we’re set up for 2015-style disappointment in terms of the real economy.
2984 2018-01-13 04:19:06 All I see is an economic boom. Stocks doing great, my 401k is up 26 % from last yr, more money in pocket with tax cuts... life is great outside and inside of the bubble
2985 2018-01-13 04:18:51 Easily a 20% growth coming for MJX ETF from now. The price at 34 is a great entry point #invest #Marijuanastocks

Big week , All of the above stocks will continue to rally.

Jeff sessions can for no reason  slow down this green rush
2986 2018-01-13 04:18:42 We are so programed that the standard practice is  a movie of  color last one to two weeks in a theater; and then straight to DVD.   We have to change this.  Buy stocks in the companies that control this industry.
2987 2018-01-13 04:18:25 How has one man single handedly exposed the media, in several countries mind you, as mere political advocacy arms rendering them laughing stocks to the entire world? Perhaps @realDonaldTrump greatest accomplishment! #stablegenius
2988 2018-01-13 04:18:18 My stocks are growing daily--everybody I know is benefiting from Trump's economy--and it is actually pretty entertaining to see you leftists freak out over some new issue each and every day of the week while everyone else enjoys life! LOL
2989 2018-01-13 04:14:11 Hell yah! 
2990 2018-01-13 04:13:11 Best life scenario: win the lottery, invest my winnings in stocks, then take care of all the animals in the world.

2998 2018-01-13 04:03:30 Financial means claims on another entity (as opposed to real wealth, which is claims on objects like gold, a house, some food, etc). Examples of financial wealth include bonds, stocks, money, etc. Net means for the sector as a whole. When you aggregate to multiple entities,
2999 2018-01-13 04:03:15 If you (the person reading this right now) believe that 25% cash, 25% real estate, 25% stocks, 25% crypto (“risk fund” haha) is the proper way to allocate your portfolio, then you have not a single clue what you are doing. I don’t care if your name is Fred Wilson. You’re lost.

3001 2018-01-13 04:00:26 “I like a mix of cash (t-bills, money market funds, etc), blue chips stocks (Amazon, Google, etc), real estate (income producing with little to no leverage), and a risk bucket (venture capital, crypto, etc). I think 25% in each would be a good mix.”

Um, good luck with that Fred.
3002 2018-01-13 04:00:15 That’s a straw man because the CAPE wasn’t bearish 8 years ago. But either way, I’ll answer. Simply become more conservative as stocks rally.

3032 2018-01-13 03:37:34 bump stocks did not do the kind of shooting that happened in Vegas so this is probably a fake story to advance the narrative. there were 2 separate machine guns firing simultaniously and that can only happen in Rambo movies, not Real life.

3037 2018-01-13 03:35:25 I had this problem when I started too. What I ended up doing was only buy only in afternoon if opportunity, and try to sell early next day. Alternate stocks so they dont count as day trades. Only used day trades if I needed to get out of a stock that same day I bought it. +20/80r

3052 2018-01-13 03:27:03 They were extended, what was extended with them? Our debt ceiling. Well, fact is "not alternative fact" the stock market doing well does nothing for the ones who don't own stocks, under Trump company stock buy backs are up 80% which means that the corps are seeing the profit
3053 2018-01-13 03:25:49 Is it us or do half the media outlets seem terrified of #cryptocurrency #bitcoin and related #altcoins because in most instances, they simply don't understand it or its a threat to their normal manipulative ways over stocks and bonds!!!!

3056 2018-01-13 03:22:33 So I’m working on this stocks and options training course that’s going to be available online soon. This is one of the most exciting projects I’ve worked on my whole life. Whether it’s successful or bombs, I have to do it. The thought of not knowing would drive me crazy 
3057 2018-01-13 03:22:01 Girls are like stocks,you either invest in them early. Or be mad when they blow up later
3058 2018-01-13 03:21:02 SEBI is discussing delisting companies whose mcap is below 10 cr.

This implies that penny stock promoters will jack up prices to stay listed

Though it is difficult to find quality penny stocks, we should try.

3062 2018-01-13 03:19:22 They banned bump stocks for muzzle loaders.. IDIOTS !  They base their decision on the caliber, not the actual mechanics of the firearm.  We need competent leaders, yes more like Trump.. less polosi and Elizabeth Warren morons
3063 2018-01-13 03:19:07 interested to know your reasons for stocks being an easier market. Currently trading ES only and looking to trade stocks this year too

3073 2018-01-13 03:09:16 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
3074 2018-01-13 03:08:27 Woman, you can buy AR's and bump stocks from anywhere
3075 2018-01-13 03:07:07 Sir, can you share the stocks in your portfolio?
3076 2018-01-13 03:06:51 @BilldeBlasioNYC makes common cause with climate fraud Marxist extremists divesting NYC from Oil company stocks in public sector pension funds .Its a ploy to hide muni govt mismanagement of those funds.#Diversion
3077 2018-01-13 03:05:59 You dems claim to be more educated.  So all of you must have flunked math 101.  Since Trump was elected the market capitalization has increased 16 trillion. When those stocks are sold the tax will be 3.2 Trillion.
3078 2018-01-13 03:05:53 Obama not even close to trump with the economy, Dow up out of this world #'s this year, I have a 401k and stocks. Am I not suppose to support them improving for the future of my children??

3082 2018-01-13 03:00:44 What indicators do you use for finding an entry on the 6 or so stocks you  primarily watch
3083 2018-01-13 03:00:42 Do you ever hold stocks for the long term or do you just use options? Thanks!
3084 2018-01-13 02:58:48 Instead of stocks we can innovate an electronic 'stocks' - where he can be assaulted verbally (or 'splained-to') by everyone; plus he has to read a book - of the communities' choosing - about tolerance online (reading out-loud in a Youtube Hangout for example).

3089 2018-01-13 02:53:02 @WarriorTrading1 I see lots of traders/trainers go after OTC stocks. Other than volatility why do you trade them?
3090 2018-01-13 02:51:21 In Ja, the swing is IPOs. Need to get some stocks here.
3091 2018-01-13 02:50:09 In my local cafe at the moment there are two people working on the communal table as a standing desk. One brings his own cardboard wine bottle divider as a laptop stand, the other grabbed a bonsoy box from the cafe stocks
3092 2018-01-13 02:48:47 That's awesome Brody. Exactly stocks that spike quickly will retrace and usually bounce you can buy the dip I do it all the time
3093 2018-01-13 02:47:28 Investing in Stocks is the thing to do in 2018
3094 2018-01-13 02:47:17 No. They are closing 64 Sams Clubs. So they are still laying people off at ATT, Carrier( remember when Trump saved those jobs) coal jobs are not coming back ect ect ect. But damn those stocks are great.
3095 2018-01-13 02:46:34 Probably, I don’t short four dollars stocks
3096 2018-01-13 02:45:10 Prices should come down as investors leave the market some renters may become buyers but most still will not be able to afford it, and rental stocks will fall driving up rents for those who can least afford it?
3097 2018-01-13 02:42:13 Sports teams are like the stock market and blue chip stocks.

The market will fluctuate. 

But always trust the well-established company that has operated for many years.
3098 2018-01-13 02:42:12 With so much of the public and private retirement systems in stocks, it seems like an uphill battle to increase the corporate tax rate.

3104 2018-01-13 02:39:23 My stocks are doing great too... but economics and money aren’t everything. Can’t take it with you when you die! But your legacy of being on the right or wrong side of history lives forever.
3105 2018-01-13 02:38:48 Crappy stocks are flying, as they are unburdened by the weight of strong financials /good corporate governance.

Thus, i now  try to avoid telling anyone to sell any stock in this market. 

Unless it's out and out  garbage...then I can't resist. Kambakht raha nahi jaata
3106 2018-01-13 02:38:37 Stocks keep rollin
3107 2018-01-13 02:38:07 The bigger questions are who owns all the bitcoins and marijuana stocks?

3109 2018-01-13 02:36:51 instead of letting private citizens abscond with the profits from resource extraction of their commons, they put the $$ into international investments (also to avoid the 'Dutch Disease'). This pension fund is over $1T now and owns 3-4% of all global stocks, $200k+ per capita.
3110 2018-01-13 02:36:20 Definitely not an objective of mine to get into cryptocurrency this year. My strategy is just keeping on with the boring old couch potato model for now... and a few stocks.

Thanks & I have followed you back!
3113 2018-01-13 02:33:31 I want stocks in Tesla! I swear when I come up, I’m investing in everything. Fuck jewelry and fancy cars.
3114 2018-01-13 02:32:37 I disagree.. Companies won't have secondary offerings when they are focused on buy backs. And central banks are using holdings to produce inflation and can't risk selling and undoing their work, pensions can't sell they are still under funded and owning stocks is bailing them out
3115 2018-01-13 02:31:50 That's why they changed the name to "climate change", and Al Gore dumped all of his green energy stocks... After he made a killing and won a Nobel prize for reading a script.
3116 2018-01-13 02:31:23 Great list. I think I had all three solar stocks. I made enough in one day that I bought my ex wife a new expedition. #thegoodoldays

3129 2018-01-13 02:19:09 Volatility is really just a function of time.  Stocks go up and down in price just as much but over years, not weeks.  Who has time for that these days??

#cryptocurrency trading is faster, and the gains and losses are magnified accordingly.

3138 2018-01-13 02:08:43 I meant Wings final and Muster merch. I don't know if they're actually labeled as limited edition but Big Hit usually never stocks up once they run out . Whereas I'm pretty sure BT21 is going to be around for a long while.
3139 2018-01-13 02:06:52 No it's called facts, he's made us more money in one night then anyone else. The stocks rose just for him becoming President. He's also keeping our Country secure and safe.

3142 2018-01-13 02:05:39 Thinking just because December '17 was the bullest couple of weeks ever that it's always gonna be like that. Not how it works. Just look at the NYSE and how long it takes those stocks to rise anywhere near what we are seeing
3143 2018-01-13 02:05:14 KP vs KAT at half:

Really fun battle so far
3144 2018-01-13 02:03:27 That only helps people with stocks and bonds. Poor people don’t have those. Many middle class people don’t have those. The economy IS good. For the rich!

3156 2018-01-13 01:52:19 To short weed stocks, I want to see:
- High volume break < 50 day MA.
- Upset bulls at work asking me for advice
- Fraud uncovered or a major U.S player starting to produce.
3157 2018-01-13 01:50:05 Nobody cares. Taxes lower,stocks higher,employment up, regulations down,border crossings down, minority employment up, best XMas in a generation, ISIS decimated, and we are worried about one word. All the libs have left. Desperate

3165 2018-01-13 01:44:04 How about democrats help keep the government running if republicans agree to censure Trump, ban bump stocks and reinstate CHIP / DACA?

3169 2018-01-13 01:43:07 In my mind $ETH has already won. It's over $1,000 USD! 

Many stocks in the NYSE will never be that high!
3170 2018-01-13 01:42:28 Not to exclude making it a crime to feed the homeless. 

Of course in a fake economy, they don't want others to see the extent of poverty in America.

Stocks are up, but it's not feeding the poor. Only the rich.
3171 2018-01-13 01:41:59 So I say let thoes countries fix themselves all's it takes is one to start a chain reaction to real reform  and prosperity it's true just look at DONALD J TRUMP he singal handedly changed our country for the better stocks are up taxes are down and soon a wall to keep us safe wow.
3172 2018-01-13 01:41:08 What do you living under a rock? A "dumpster fire"..really? Just STFU you don't have a clue as to what you are talking about.  Stocks are up, unemployment down, less taxes oh that's right you have to have a job first...right moron?
3173 2018-01-13 01:37:55 Trump accomplished nothing but a bargain basement sale of middle and lower class retirement and healthcare, and selling out the environment too, to any corporation who will bid on them. The dollar is weak right now, explains a lot about why stocks are being snatched up and rising

3177 2018-01-13 01:35:25 @ATFHQ Also #LasVegas was an isolated incident. There has not been ANY pattern of Bump Stocks being used. They are a gimmick and have faded from popularity somewhat in the years that they have been around.
3178 2018-01-13 01:34:37 My advice to young investors..become a master in 2/3 stocks..instead of 50.

Know more about your 2/3 cos than anyone else on d-street. 

Remember..u just need 1 "nanocap to midcap" to change your life..and the lives of ur future generations.

Good morning
3179 2018-01-13 01:33:49 why were the cannabis stocks destroyed today?
3180 2018-01-13 01:33:15 @ATFHQ Bump Stocks do not change the LEGAL definition of Semi Auto.  DO NOT change your ruling on the definitions. #WeHaveRights #SecondAmendment Rights to be specific.
3181 2018-01-13 01:32:43 Frank should really work on the issue with Frankfurt and the change of the old to the news stocks at first to show a clear traceability of the company.... @maikan5 @AGORACOM $SX

3194 2018-01-13 01:22:57 NOT claiming know everything, but: I'm 25, have multiple degrees, am DEBT-FREE, own my car, my house (+ landlord 3 tenants in that house), have various investments in stocks (+cryptos), travel int'l on CC points... If anybody ever wants to talk $$$, I am HAPPY to share knowledge
3195 2018-01-13 01:22:50 @Lee_in_Iowa @williamcson @Enjoneer01 2. In fact the over priced stocks, high debt low wages breeding ground for a Deppression
3196 2018-01-13 01:22:03 Or invest in stocks.... up 47% in 5 months....
3197 2018-01-13 01:16:10 And all the stocks I haven't bought yet went up today, some a lot.
3198 2018-01-13 01:13:07 Lol hope u can do it man. I'm short with avg DWT avg at 12.40's after adding. Just been brutal, I never trade oil and this is why. Oil stocks are fine
3199 2018-01-13 01:11:16 If all these politicians like Graham want to help world then go to those countries and fight for change then hear lecturing us, risking our military, our rescue teams, our aid workers etc.. But again they sit in warm home, with their money in stocks,protected by US laws/security.
3200 2018-01-13 01:11:11 Well. Be interested to see bitcoin in a crisis. It may prove value... depending on timing and the state of the infrastructure by then. It should be the main focus today... You could still say, based on it’s low market cap for a currency (quit comparing to stocks!)...
3201 2018-01-13 01:10:15 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3202 2018-01-13 01:09:22 You are guiding us right way to market you highlighted airlines and those stocks rocked
3203 2018-01-13 01:09:06 Can you tell me a place from where I can purchase stocks? I thought blockfolio was for that but it’s not
3204 2018-01-13 01:08:38 @theCatalyst @jsmith14 @Mcraigd I took a $60 loss on it. Not too bad. I like the low floats and penny stocks.
3205 2018-01-13 01:07:17 @OHaraClare Interesting.  I would like to be kept posted on this new fund to jump in the train on time.  The market is just crasy on pot stocks.  It will blow up but like the tech in the 90,s, why stay on the side and watch.  I am ready to throw in fresh money.
3206 2018-01-13 01:05:21 Damn, I’m sleep on the stocks
3207 2018-01-13 01:04:13 What's a good app to use to invest in stocks?
3208 2018-01-13 01:04:13 Dunken fantastic Dow Jones +228 should help stocks nove.
3209 2018-01-13 01:03:46 And there are a number of ways for him to earn 5% on his investment. Index funds, individual stocks, etc.
3210 2018-01-13 01:03:46 Back to my original point, all I am saying is that Wall Street is getting cheaper taxes and soaring stocks.  Seems like a great time to be a billionaire in this country.  As far as the working man having something to celebrate, i haven't seen that yet. But I will read.
3211 2018-01-13 01:03:11 Even though it did, commodities tend to differ from stocks and fx.

3218 2018-01-13 00:56:40 I'm not a big fan of trump , but hell of a better president that Hillary ever would of been. He put more money in your pockets and stocks are up. For all you people who have no idea wtf your talking about stop bad mouthing trump and educate yourself before you speak.
3219 2018-01-13 00:56:12 Like to see you do 5-8 stock charts - I think your people that follow you need to understand though you have a narrow focus on 5-8 stocks at a time and just simply don't waste charting garbage stocks.
3220 2018-01-13 00:55:54 True, Chad M. doesn’t own any stocks but he’s pretty excited about that
3221 2018-01-13 00:52:13 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood Love your app. Would like to see a ‘sort feature’ by alphabetical order and price for stocks in hand and stocks on the ‘watching’ list.

3224 2018-01-13 00:50:35 Some say I live in a #ShitHole country in which 15 million #Illegals came from their non-shithole countries.  Meanwhile #shithole #Stocks roar ahead again to record shithole highs.
3225 2018-01-13 00:49:12 My 401-k literally made $500 yesterday. #Stocks are on fire! That's one day. I could not give one #shithole about #StormyDaniels
3226 2018-01-13 00:49:06 Also wanna dabble in stocks or some shit this year. Make some investments

3229 2018-01-13 00:46:41 me born 22 year ago today.
3230 2018-01-13 00:46:19 It’s one measure, yep. Dragged along by the US markets and pot stocks, that have tumbled the last two days. Too bad we’re being taxed to death, negates any gains on a personal level. And soon we’re going to be one big Amsterdam. High taxes and pot everywhere. Great. 
3231 2018-01-13 00:46:10 So I went and checked. At current market value, ten stocks of this company would be ~2110 USD. That's... pretty nice.
3232 2018-01-13 00:44:54 Keep following my blog and you'll probably get better returns on your stocks.
3233 2018-01-13 00:44:08 @canntrader I'm fairly new to trading in pot stocks. I have some ACB and some WEED. These last couple of days have not been good. I guess it's the correction everyone has talked about. Any idea how long it will last? Any predictions?
3234 2018-01-13 00:44:05 Also, I mean safe as in consistent average on a 20-40 year time frame. So that means a mix of aggressive stocks, index ETFs, and real estate.
3235 2018-01-13 00:43:42 --Sorry? So by enrolling into a rewards program for this pizza company, I have a chance at getting ten stocks in the company? That's... interesting.
3236 2018-01-13 00:42:05 Hit box iffy uh

3237 2018-01-13 00:42:01 “I don’t buy that shit” ~my mom talking about stocks
3238 2018-01-13 00:41:50 Socks and stocks, I didn’t think I could love this show more
3239 2018-01-13 00:41:49 i can invest in stocks and make money today ?
3240 2018-01-13 00:40:45 That’s a tough goal you’ve set up for yourself. Have you considered adding Northwest Healthcare REIT to your other monthly dividend stocks?
3241 2018-01-13 00:38:50 #Stocks,#Indexes We remain long SPX, at 2683, and, regarding NDX, intensely focused on spotting a propitious entry point.  Have to get it right. Not before a pullback.
3242 2018-01-13 00:36:09 Do people who really want DJT out the most actually own any stocks?
3243 2018-01-13 00:35:28 Yeah easier said than done as anyone in the MJ stocks are finding today!  January to remember for sure.
3244 2018-01-13 00:34:12 The ATR on cryptos is ~5x that of tech stocks it's insane! ... so if you use Trend Following it will calc very small position sizes to accountfor the volatility
3245 2018-01-13 00:34:02 Guaranteed Warren Buffett doesn't understand crypto and should stay out of the market and off the news 
He should talk about what he knows stocks and business but the future is here and never waits for old men with old ideas
3246 2018-01-13 00:33:55 Please do something Cory us wall street investors in marijuana stocks are taking a beating because what that old man did, even scotts miracle grow stock took a hit a 6 billion dollar company and it is still down today, he has no right to upset the markets
3247 2018-01-13 00:33:42 Tell him he's welcome and that he should buy stocks in Google, once Google happens.
3248 2018-01-13 00:33:31 The only times I've been tempted were because the store stocks Cheerwine.
3249 2018-01-13 00:33:25 I think now an entire set of stocks can become the next big thing.I see this as great but I am a capitalist.
3250 2018-01-13 00:30:31 What evidence do you need? Tax reform is best for corporations. Of course stock markets love it. Stocks had the best year in a long time. The tax reform and the still to be implemented infrastructure plan replaced QE as the new crack for markets.
3251 2018-01-13 00:27:48 middle aged guy at my work told me that he thinks Trump is a moron but his stocks are doing well so he really doesn't care about anything else
3252 2018-01-13 00:27:32 Agree!!! Put your money in stocks instead. 0% chance of having a crash.......
3253 2018-01-13 00:25:36 Everyone into stocks now 
3254 2018-01-13 00:23:38 I'm going to see the Oracle. She'll bake me some cookies and everything will be right as rain, Also, I'll ask her about the crypto at stocks,exchange.

3257 2018-01-13 00:21:55 Just saw our local Bumper to Bumper stocks it now,thinking of trying it,dose it work like they say?
3258 2018-01-13 00:21:46 I got a fiancee, a home with no mortgage, a full time job, my stocks are doing good, my business had a record year, I got 3 dogs in my house atm. Fuck y'all negative people, the real world is full of blessed things if you look up for once
3259 2018-01-13 00:20:59 Your over outrage is pathetic
3260 2018-01-13 00:20:56 USD lost 7% since election night. Still a massive year for stocks in USD terms. Should be observed that since election night Fed tightening was already priced in, but ECB & BoJ tightening was not.
3261 2018-01-13 00:20:30 I don’t think lithium is such a worry. It’s not scare in comparison to Cobalt. Cobalt stocks should see a huge rerate this year.
3262 2018-01-13 00:20:21 much higher!!!!-gdx gld charts soon to become oil xle. So many people believe in measured moves according to fib levels/yes when in consolidation no when it breaks. The g mining stocks are about to become wild beasts and people will miss $ because they will try to trade

3266 2018-01-13 00:15:13 GDP up, lowest unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics in decades, wages rising, stocks surging, tax cuts. Enough said.
3267 2018-01-13 00:15:12 I’m the last guy to defend @HardballChris.Never liked him. I understand how his comment could piss you off. Still, i don’t believe he said it with TRUE intent. Me/my friends (females included) warped sense of humor would have us in stocks on the square for much less based on this
3268 2018-01-13 00:15:03 Wait... I thought everything was perking right along... Were they lying before? Are they lying now? Are his lips moving? Does his stock portfolio need a boost? (Pssst... Buy marijuana stocks!) So it'll slow in 2018 BUT rebound in 2019 just in time for the election! Amazing. 
3269 2018-01-13 00:13:51 H. Clinton puts all her eggs in one basket, all her investments are made through membership in The Vanguard Group.  The  Vanguard owns controlling interest in nearly all major corporations. That is where the Haitian money went.  Stocks up, Haiti S---hole.
3270 2018-01-13 00:13:35 My tesco stocks only movie stuff... And not any good ones...
3271 2018-01-13 00:13:13 Used Vol/mCap as essentially the crypto equivalent to % of float traded in pump and dump stocks. Just a second derivative with some telling features. 

400% of volume-to-market cap traded in a daily session... ive seen alot but never that
3272 2018-01-13 00:13:09 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
3273 2018-01-13 00:12:19 You’re a crack heard
3274 2018-01-13 00:11:06 Careful remember @JoeNBC intern, hope her heart is good
3275 2018-01-13 00:10:30 Ok well my stocks say different. My taxes say different. The unemployment rate says different. The increase in jobs say different. Black unemployment says different & yes he believes American citizens come first. Oh Isis is getting crushed.
3276 2018-01-13 00:08:53 AYO WE GOT A BROTHER IN STOCKS AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT. We lit! @FreeTown30 @AKARobNHood
3277 2018-01-13 00:08:37 I was thinking .14.  Nice call  it's over .20 now
3278 2018-01-13 00:08:05 5 different barrels, 5 grips, 5 stocks, 6 scopes, 5 different bodies and then you have the accessories that can drop them as well. You also have 7 different prefixes too. Hit up @Joltzdude139 he knows everything about that stuff.
3279 2018-01-13 00:07:30 Remember who voted for this tax cut dec. 2017   just look at who those r. next the crash of your 401k retirement...(stocks)...its coming the great theft. these folks in the photo @ the south portico will not lose a penny when it happens. happens every time Republican take office.
3280 2018-01-13 00:07:27 I felt so next level today when I had a good convo with my manager about purchasing stocks. Sometimes it's nice being an adult

3284 2018-01-13 00:02:57 Based on what evidence? Stocks, jobs, business, vets, millitary?
3285 2018-01-13 00:02:38 My moms tried to tell me today “marijuana stocks” are poppin. But hates that mans bun weed 
3286 2018-01-13 00:02:21 Sold half my pot stocks before the dip. Diversified my holdings at what appears to have been a very good time. Letting the other half ride. Still believe in the companies and the industry.
3287 2018-01-13 00:01:38 Are you sure there aren’t better stocks? It is not just about picking an undervalued stock. It is also about picking the best one amongst the options. I suspect that there may be better options. This may be a value trap.

3293 2018-01-12 23:56:07 If he liquidated the stocks, not only would he have to go through the SEC and Legal to prove it's not insider trading, but he'd also end up driving down the valuation of the company.

3295 2018-01-12 23:54:24 To those who knew him from the beginning, Buffett's success comes as no surprise: He was picking out stocks at 11 years old and had amassed the equivalent of $53,000 in today's dollars by the time he was 16.
3296 2018-01-12 23:50:55 I think that was a good story. It’s a great turn around. I didn’t know that any stock had outgrown those big name stocks in the last 9 years.
3297 2018-01-12 23:50:43 So I've put $4,250 into stocks over the last couple of years and it's almost turned into $20,000
Don't know how y'all do that 9-5 shit

3322 2018-01-12 23:47:03 #CryptoNews The only thing I see on social media is: people with low stacks promotes the coin and people with huge stocks creates #FUD or be negatieve to buy low. Welcome to the #realcryptoworld! Buy the coin that is active, has potential, a community and has #cryptofuture
3323 2018-01-12 23:46:40 wrong, a bitcoin maximalist would invest in synthetic meat penny stocks
3324 2018-01-12 23:46:19 I wish I could short football teams and short stocks for a living. Raiders would've been my #1 short. Next year I'm long Cleveland and short Carolina!
3325 2018-01-12 23:45:19 I might have been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,
3326 2018-01-12 23:44:41 if the left, dems, & msm succeed in taking trump down thru false illegal means, the winning will implode: stocks, jobs, economy, housing etc, america will turn into to a chaos shithole never seen before & obama will head the UN & bring some weird peace as in antichrist fashion!
3327 2018-01-12 23:44:28 @ChrisSonnex you have made yourself one of the biggest laughing stocks in the world and it’s a fucking joy to watch

3330 2018-01-12 23:43:27 Keep thinking that, the economy is surging, stocks are through the roof. If Blue wave wins and everything goes the opposite way, Dems will never win another presidency again.

3332 2018-01-12 23:40:39 The subject matter has changed-olden time stocks r OVER.
3333 2018-01-12 23:39:56 @jimcramer Thanks for the analysis on the gaming stocks tonight, Jim. How about the potential long-term catalyst that is gaming in Japan? These companies are salivating at the prospect of opening that market: Sheldon Adelson says he would put $10 billion in. Am I right on this?
3334 2018-01-12 23:39:05 first of all i make all my stocks by myself and secondly i dont really use layerstyle i simply create dark blue shadows and try to work around them but thanks for your feedback tho!
3335 2018-01-12 23:37:53 Probably won’t matter for stocks until it starts pricing in rate cuts
3336 2018-01-12 23:37:24 Bruh my jobs stocks are high rn . I hope they stay like that till next month so I can sell them and get some 
3337 2018-01-12 23:36:50 Another record day for stocks! We can’t retire on a hope and a prayer. #maga
3338 2018-01-12 23:36:45 I prefer buying stocks when they are going up.
3339 2018-01-12 23:36:33 Stocks surge to record close, have best start to a year since 2003 Stocks rose to record highs on Friday
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.46 points to close at 25,803.19
The S&P 500 also reached a record high, climbing 0.7 percent to 2,786.24 #MAGA
3340 2018-01-12 23:36:26 Great list.  Why are you not short some of these crazy Bitcoin/Blockchain names?  

I completely agree with you about both blockchain stocks being crazy and its relation to an overall top forming in the market.

3344 2018-01-12 23:32:37 That's enough for a few penny stocks. So thank you! But no mug for you
3345 2018-01-12 23:31:32 Good point. And could have "said" in 80-82 that stocks aren't cheap relative to rates. Easy to see the same but opposite reaction everyone is having now.
3346 2018-01-12 23:31:12 Exactly....keep track of number of stocks off top of chart. Figure out what number ends up the blowoff top number.
3347 2018-01-12 23:29:50 Glad I don't have any condom stocks

3354 2018-01-12 23:23:57 Your post loses meaning when you see the sudden rise before his post.  Stocks aren't a stable ship.  Ultimately its the yearly gains that are important and the drop you're focusing on is rather small in comparison.
3355 2018-01-12 23:23:12 My liver is not an option either. 
Are wine stocks rising?
3356 2018-01-12 23:23:01 Hard to use sentiment by itself to move to sidelines on one’s whole allocation unless one is just trading ... one 2% pullback in stocks alone would send that bullish sentiment figure back to 50%, from 90 or wherever it is now
3357 2018-01-12 23:21:45 In ny again, what a run in THREE STOCKS.
3358 2018-01-12 23:21:26 FAKE FOX NEWS TWEETS! This thing with the STOCKS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE when they elect a new potus, And there r more KURDS FIGHTING ISIS THANAMERICANS!
3359 2018-01-12 23:21:26 Don't invest in individual stocks. Also in bank or any sector. Invest in SPY. Better invest in ACWI. Leave individual stocks to Cramer, hedge funds & other big investors who most of the time do no better than market or SPY. Avoid risk.

3361 2018-01-12 23:18:16 I usually trade in and out of stocks too. I’m forcing myself to hold $MGTI because I can easily see it going 10x this year. #MGTI
3362 2018-01-12 23:17:14 Too bad they cut thousands of jobs having a net neutral cost to raised wages. Huh, I wonder where that 15% went? Better check my stocks.
3363 2018-01-12 23:16:36 How about reportall good news in the US like @FoxNews. Stocks are record high. Even Walmart is giving bonus and raises. CNN is not what it was. Soon all advertiser will pull.
3364 2018-01-12 23:16:14 Be ready people, this Stock Markets gonna crash bad, it's just going crazy no control other then being led by GREED. I just have a feeling it's gonna go bad real quick. No stocks or 401k here but this greed is going to screw us all over
3365 2018-01-12 23:15:59 I see like 5 advertisements for weed related stuff within 2 minutes of scrolling on twitter. Yet all the weed supporters whine about stigma and they somehow need more support. Yeah ok. What thing is being endorsed by celebs and has like a million penny stocks behind it again?

3369 2018-01-12 23:13:52 Facts: IRA’s/stocks record after record, 90% workers take home more money, lower taxes, companies returning to USA, lowest unemployment in 7 years, lowest African American unemployment in 45 years. I like facts and can ignore exaggerated noise.
3370 2018-01-12 23:12:53 But my friend told me stocks are going up, he said I am certain to win!

3381 2018-01-12 23:00:09 People wouldn’t go out of work. The market cap would just drop and anyone invested in amazon would see a drop in their net worth. Stocks are suppply and demand not directly correlated with the companies book value.

3398 2018-01-12 22:54:11 I started following @business because I am buying stocks for the first time. But then I see 90% of what they post about is news on Trump. Is there any business account that I can follow for actual business and stock news? #Annoyed

3400 2018-01-12 22:54:02 I will quote @srqstockpicker: "You sold #crispr stocks on one non-peer reviewed paper on a 6 month old release? Thanks for the 5 points."
3401 2018-01-12 22:51:54 I agree that a correction/downturn is inevitable at some point. If that concerns you, take your profits on stocks and put them into cash. That's a financial decision for you to make. But why would EVERY #Democrat oppose a tax bill that's putting money in so many people's pockets?
3402 2018-01-12 22:51:32 That sounds a lot like overpaying for high P/E big cap consumer staples stocks, in immigration form.
3403 2018-01-12 22:51:12 Does this mean we get to put you in the stocks for being a divorcée?
3404 2018-01-12 22:50:45 Another good week for shareholders, as the S&P Global BMI added $715 billion, w/YTD up $2.098 trillion (up $12.962T from the election); U.S stocks have added $1.118 trillion YTD ($6.340T fr election) and non-U.S. issues are up $0.981 trillion YTD ($6.623T fr election)
3405 2018-01-12 22:49:45 @tthbaker With the recent big increase in the stock price of HIP to over $3 your deal with CanniMed for 33/1000 is ridiculous. Even with todays close on both stocks, HIP would have to be trading at 79 cents for it to be an equal deal. Unfortunately HIP is down today to $1.68,

3409 2018-01-12 22:48:30 Since Trump was elected my company is put 6 years of work on the books, we branched out into three more States and can't keep up with all the work, in this last year I have made$187,000 from my stocks, and my salary increased by  20,000 ... Life is ecstatic 
3410 2018-01-12 22:48:17 No matter how you try to argue it, there is simply no correlation bw guns & cars. One is designed to kill. One to transport. Bump stocks make the one designed to kill far more effective. The world is a better place without guns. We need transport.
3411 2018-01-12 22:47:49 So you suggest that the Government forbids to buy stocks?

Or the FED?

And if you are wrong? Can you take it in notice? Come on, "socialism" like in the old days?
3412 2018-01-12 22:47:09 oh? i thought you have stocks of hot and cheesy pizza! anyway that’s so cute!
3413 2018-01-12 22:47:04 @LittleStocks20 What's good Stocks, I can't comment on your stream and I don't really know why, so if you could let me know why that would be great
3414 2018-01-12 22:46:33 $100 min, but I could see this blowin' up and me makin' some $$$$.  It's honestly nice to hear a black entertainer talking to fans about stocks even if it is to promote his own shit. :)
3415 2018-01-12 22:46:20 This is a continuing trend, not saying he didn't help just pointing out a fact. In my view I see these closings and layoffs as the beginning of either a major slow down or drop in the stocks, which while not a perfect comparison for the economy is pretty good.

3428 2018-01-12 22:39:11 Put the great majority of the full lump sum in various stocks & other investments & then collect on the interest. He’d make a good chunk of the money back pretty well. I’d take the lump sum too.
3429 2018-01-12 22:37:06 John - we are working hard to make America great again.  President Trump speaks the truth and remember President Trump denies it and all liberal whiners like you believe the one guy that supposedly heard shithole.  Help us #maga.  I bet your stocks are looking good btw.
3430 2018-01-12 22:35:22 Are you that stupid, I work on a big box store so I am 100% middle class and my 401k and IRA are getting 22% rate of return. My stocks are off the chart.

3434 2018-01-12 22:34:10 No. Its a case of sector rotation, the 'cpu issue' that has tainted many semi-con' stocks, and finally... a case of 'it can't go up every day/month, right?'. $MU and $AMAT are both superb, but sitting very close to s/t support.

3448 2018-01-12 22:29:54 It is most definitely illegal. This whole crypto market is full of things that are illegal in stocks but are not in crypto. Pump and dumps are also a huge issue here. I’d like to see some sort of regulation but that also limits the freedoms given by crypto
3449 2018-01-12 22:29:12 Ouais je sais, y'en a un près de chez moi mais je pense qu'il faut qu'ils refassent les stocks y'a plus grand chose 
Mais bon c'est déjà pas mal 
3450 2018-01-12 22:29:09 Bring back the stocks!
3451 2018-01-12 22:26:19 Do the math...he was worth NOTHING. It’s not like he invested in his business or stocks, he’s freaking corrupt.
3452 2018-01-12 22:25:37 Haven't you heard -
 Its different this time
The Fed has our back
Tax reform will boost earnings significantly
Global synchronized growth
CB tightening is good for stocks
 and on and on....
3453 2018-01-12 22:24:22 I guess it is what it is 
3454 2018-01-12 22:23:26 Another amazing week for stocks. While the public is fascinated with the gyrations of crypto currencies, the stock market has been going up almost every for 15 months. Just saying this game is a lot easier.
3455 2018-01-12 22:23:25 nuclear power should also be banned, think radioactive waste pollution poisoning oceans & fish stocks for centuries
3456 2018-01-12 22:23:20 Not tech stock....which happens to be our best industry. When they voted against net neutrality those stocks tanked. I know cause i work for one and it hurt me. You still havent admitted stocks broke multiple records during Obamas 8 years
3457 2018-01-12 22:21:53 WOW! Knew Dwyer was a crooked scrub.
3458 2018-01-12 22:21:28 Good ass stocks are also; index funds and mutual funds with a good track record
3459 2018-01-12 22:21:17 Exited $TWTR on valuation concerns. Initiated a position in $OMC (a new holding in Morningstar's portfolios) near 1.5% of single stocks. Cash is 13% of assets.
3460 2018-01-12 22:20:39 that's not really the case though. Some well managed stocks are definite success stories. And we're talking about wild....
3461 2018-01-12 22:20:07 Hi Hannah. The freebie products are only available while stocks last. Once these have finished you won't be able to use the vouchers. Sorry for any disappointment caused by this. Thanks, Karen

3463 2018-01-12 22:17:27 The dollar hit it's bottom trend line today.  All to do with massive QE into stocks stateside weakening the dollar.

Brexiteers are crazy.
3464 2018-01-12 22:17:16 Amazon stocks were $10 for 1 two years ago. I think they like $80 for 1 now.
3465 2018-01-12 22:16:52 What's stopping you from investing in the stock market? There are a few free ways to invest, and you don't need to be rich to do so. We're far from the 10%, but we own a little stocks and have retirement plans through our employers. It's all about living below your means.
3466 2018-01-12 22:16:35 I was around in the "dotcom boom".  We were "making" CRAZY money from almost tech stock.  My stock options were "worth" over $1M six months into a new job... I held most of the stocks TOO LONG and the company cratered leaving the stock options WORTHLESS.  Enjoy today.
3467 2018-01-12 22:14:42 Market Close: MBS -6bps; DOW +228.46; NASDAQ +49.28; S&P 500 +18.68; 10yr Treasury 2.55%; MBS initially down 41bps after hot Core CPI, but later shrugged off.  Stocks continue new highs.
3468 2018-01-12 22:14:31 That’s what I’ve been saying this whole time. Seeing these stocks skyrocket with no news and some not even starting production till the summer is crazy!
3469 2018-01-12 22:14:21 There's nothing left to save for. Houses have been eaten up. Stocks are bursting. All that's left is avocados on toast.
3470 2018-01-12 22:13:43 Most get it twisted. If you not investing that money in things that appreciate (real estate, stocks, bonds, art) and not things that depreciate (cars, jewelry) than you will not build generational wealth.

3477 2018-01-12 22:06:55 So that guy who used to work for you dumped over $24 million in stocks w/ insider info about that security flaw. Didn’t people used to go to jail for things like that?
3478 2018-01-12 22:06:22 im hilarious u sweaty kangaroos pouch looking fucker
3479 2018-01-12 22:06:00 That's why stocks in the north sea is growing,go to ICES and look at the levels. It's done by independent researchers.
3480 2018-01-12 22:05:02 What about stocks that pay dividends? Sorry, I still prefer my books to reading a prospectus, but money is money.
3481 2018-01-12 22:04:18 Stocks gonna be low on them bad boys, when I’ve rounded up the troops 
3482 2018-01-12 22:04:03 In just one of those stocks. He never told me which one though.
3483 2018-01-12 22:02:48 Quick question do you ever short stocks?
3484 2018-01-12 22:02:24 More likely it was leaked to take the focus off of the spectacular economic news...bonuses, pay raises, stocks. In April, when small businesses give out bonuses, they will do it again. Mark my words. 
3485 2018-01-12 22:02:10 Glad you didn't buy....so far all of this guys stocks r pump n dumps. None stay up. As soon as it opens its high and just goes down and dies not go up. Look at WNDM. Don't get suckered by the wolf!
3486 2018-01-12 22:01:57 Great for the stocks, weaker dollar, no rates to be raised, kill the debt by inflation, but all those who pays credit will suffer a LOT, while delinquencies raise and we all know repeat from 2008 will be now MUCH WORSE.
3487 2018-01-12 22:01:39 No one ACTUALLY knows what will happen next. Half the market is owned by people who never traded anything before so your charts are nearly worthless. For the same reason pump and dumps won't work the way they do with stocks either. Just stop lol
3488 2018-01-12 22:00:20 Stock drop: $AGM.PA and 15 other stocks drop #StockDrop #AGM.PA
3489 2018-01-12 21:59:47 Stocks rose faster under Obama.  Trump just continued Obama Isis fight.  Obama did a LOT wrong, and I never voted for him., but he wasn’t incompetent.  Trump spoke to real concerns—-sadly, he treats the job like a TV show and has disappointed many.
3490 2018-01-12 21:59:46 Bannon, the Mooch, Steven Mnuchin... all sort of like Bush sec treasury all Goldman sachs.. they lost the least and gained the most from the housing market collapse..  Yet he says drain the swamp.... he seems to be filling it up!!  Bank stocks are up today! BTW
3491 2018-01-12 21:59:32 Poor people don't have stocks or bitcoins or Ph.D.'s in Mathematics. They will have increased opportunity, and this country will be in a better position to help everyone. Good people want everyone to thrive, but that is just impossible

3500 2018-01-12 21:54:47 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-11, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
3501 2018-01-12 21:54:19 And major russian indices did even better, because RSX is underweight oil stocks compared to most benchmarks.
3502 2018-01-12 21:54:18 No mezclar flujos con stocks.
3503 2018-01-12 21:52:50 People might have been triggered, but they didn't have bump stocks.
3504 2018-01-12 21:52:16 Yeah I see that OI increased from 1,520 to 12,532...definitely significant. A lot of bullish trades in the casino stocks!
3505 2018-01-12 21:51:55 I just want to say, I never troll. Sometimes I make little jokes. But I will admit I have lost my butt this year in the mining stocks! It's a good thing my wife doesn't do Twitter
3506 2018-01-12 21:51:54 New record fund short in #Corn of 250,000 caks.  That is more than half of our 2.477 billion bushel ending stocks.
3507 2018-01-12 21:50:25 Stocks down 3.61% today
3508 2018-01-12 21:50:21 @petenajarian all bs aside. I’m at yearly returns for a lot of people already on some stocks. Crazy thing I’m 60% in. But not so enthusiastic buying now. Man we got any concerns here or your thoughts. I got a target in mind for me. I’m bad about bailing 100% and start back in.
3509 2018-01-12 21:50:02 They were checking their stocks at the time.

3512 2018-01-12 21:48:02 Most recent cowardly laughing stocks of the GOP.
3513 2018-01-12 21:47:21 When do we see the rotation back to stocks you think?
3514 2018-01-12 21:47:11 I'm all out of $ARQL. Total gain: $22,144.56, or 66.7% .... This and $QURE gains are not going to be reinvested in stocks.
3515 2018-01-12 21:47:02 I would say that's a possibility, especially with all of these bullish trades in the casino stocks. I'll be anxious to see if any news gets announced in the coming weeks.
3516 2018-01-12 21:46:25 Not really fair David.... stocks up huge y/y.
3517 2018-01-12 21:46:19 This "should" get the attention of the riff-raff crowd who left boring "old man" stocks for the exciting bitcoin ..  once they officially come back we'll likely take a breather
3518 2018-01-12 21:46:08 misconception. Not pricey at all. $350 investment turned into a $5300 profit 2 month span. This point in time is like when penny stocks were getting big in an unregulated market (Wolf of WallStreet). The next 1-2 years will be the biggest opportunities.

3535 2018-01-12 21:32:28 Y’all better get in on these Stocks it’s money to get 
3536 2018-01-12 21:31:51 Right..that’s what I am thinking. I don’t understand why people who don’t own stocks are so thrilled that billionaires and their stockholders are getting richer while companies are laying people off and doling put tiny little one time bonuses that are a pittance to them.

3542 2018-01-12 21:29:53 generally speaking, there are 50 stocks that I trade and I just rotate between them depending on money flow. For me, there is no need to scan the entire market - I watch the sector ETFs, then go to my list. rinse/repeat.  FOMO used to hurt my trading, now I focus on the few.

3545 2018-01-12 21:27:45 Stock market is only a part of the economy. Doesn't help people with no stocks. Doesn't help working class people. Neither will his trickle down economics plan.
3546 2018-01-12 21:27:01 Economy booming. Stocks booming. Employment way up. Companies daily announcing new bonuses for workers because of tax law. ISIS destroyed. 

Seems to me previous admin was the cancer that is finally being cured

3552 2018-01-12 21:24:49 I worked hard and earned two promotions, a 401K, stocks, and bought a house and a Jeep by age 23.

3572 2018-01-12 21:14:28 Ah, the GOP economy. Get rid of workers, consolidate profits and buy back stocks so the matket goes up. Great for the wealthy. Sucks for everyone else.
3573 2018-01-12 21:14:26 it looks a good start. The only problem is the number of biotech stocks is bloated. 5 years ago, i kept track of <300 bio stocks, now over 500. Soon to double. if $IBB could perform better than $SPY, I would rather put my money in the etf than working hard to find winners/losers.

Some people will come on here and bash the guy for being economically illiterate, but it's they who don't have a clue about things like the Time Value of Money, the fact that the Fed's historic QE has made stocks a great buy, and the like.
3600 2018-01-12 21:04:53 NIcholas - nice art - "trying to divest" is a JOKE. 5 stocks U mentioned, in order have the following returns over last 5 years1.97%, -3.82%, +17.6%,+2.15%, -2.61% - portfolio manager should have been fired years ago. If he were one of mine - he would have been gone....
3601 2018-01-12 21:04:25 Technically the selloff of div stocks suggests expected inflation making the yields less valuable.  i.e. if bond yields reach 2.75-3% money flows into bonds from equity yield

3617 2018-01-12 20:58:41 The idea certainly applies to stocks, & long term viability obviously matters in the long run, but we're years away from many coins achieving their goal, so I'd almost rather go for coins that I see people foaming over (& have small market caps) rather than those w/long term uses

3699 2018-01-12 20:22:06 Something I don't understand is young people spending all of their money on a fancy car... invest that into an education or stocks or at least get yourself a savings account boo???
3700 2018-01-12 20:21:40 I would put half into stocks and real estate
3701 2018-01-12 20:21:36 Agreed, the 4 risks listed are certainly up there but there are others, as you allude to. They're also not mutually exclusive, and any of them couldprecipitate the overdue correction in global #stocks. That is to say that a market crash is more an inevitability than a #BlackSwan.
3702 2018-01-12 20:21:21 I've recently got into stocks and shit so I've been keeping an eye on the economy and read an article that we've been doing better than the last 13 years . Steady 3% growth rn. Hell yeah
3703 2018-01-12 20:21:06 Mostly options on stocks, dabble in swing trading commodities as well and some cryptos.

3809 2018-01-12 19:45:21 I agree, chasing high yields alone is a recipe for disaster. But from time to time, we get the chance to purchase stocks of strong companies at a attractive price. e.g. it was really great in 2009, during the „Euro Crisis“, the commodity slump & before the Brexit Vote.

3833 2018-01-12 19:38:48 Since he made 30 billion on his stocks last year and won't pay a dime in taxes he is truly wonderful. Shame nothing that helps the social safety net of Americans.
3834 2018-01-12 19:37:36 Next week earning releases for TSX stocks are coming out heavy, watch out for surprises - good and bad!
3835 2018-01-12 19:36:30 Man what emotional roller coaster trading stocks are. I couldn’t imagine someone that invest their life’s savings into this. I’ve only invest 200 and I’m on pins and needles
3836 2018-01-12 19:35:59 So cool! Yeah, indeed, we‘re in the same boat. My portfolio combines dividend growth stocks and higher yielding shares, a nice mix as a basis, to some extent fueling itself for further growth.
3837 2018-01-12 19:35:34 Anyone who killed it on weed stocks should consider rotating some of the profits into the jr golds here. Looking ready to move!
3838 2018-01-12 19:34:49 Glo taking over 9mobile in my opinion is a good move in favour of the staff and other service providers associated with 9mobile. The government should only ensure they all get listed on NSE. MTN is on SA.STOCKS it's robbery of the Nigerian people.
3839 2018-01-12 19:34:39 Stocks at lifetime highs
3840 2018-01-12 19:33:59 So true ~ every time I detach it moves. Should treat this like my regular stocks, check once in a while and smile when I do.  This just feels more involved for some reason (likely Twitter too) ~ and I do love learning as much as I can 
3841 2018-01-12 19:33:56 $AKS added more @ 6.18
3842 2018-01-12 19:32:30 Buying stocks is supposed to be this huge big deal but I've been throwing my money away at random shit for years, this is nothing
3843 2018-01-12 19:32:21 My videos show my trade thought process after the trade has been done.  I don't have a video showing how I make my watch list.  But they are mostly large % gainers, stocks making new highs or breaking out of a wedge formation
3844 2018-01-12 19:31:49 I swear Rainman Rick doesn’t tell me everything he knows about stocks cuz magicians never reveal their secrets. Just give me the cheat codes to life Dad!
3845 2018-01-12 19:30:11 And that’s the issue - most of the people don’t understand cryptos are not stocks. You don’t own anything with it. No share - you don’t get dividends , no voting rights. Nothing. Coins are donations to the coin issuer - so you may be able to reduce your taxes :-)
3846 2018-01-12 19:30:10 The precise nature of the stocks of warehouses.
3847 2018-01-12 19:30:07 I dont encourage buying big moves its why I post stocks at support levels before the potentially make nice moves lessens potential losses greatly
3848 2018-01-12 19:30:06 Too bad. Stocks have killed it over last several years. Say hi to Easter egg bros for me.
3849 2018-01-12 19:30:01 The Nation, except for you, whom I love, backed Bernie Sanders. At the bottom of their emails, they ask if I’d like to donate stocks to them when I die. Whatever stocks I own will barely help me. What I could do was stop subscribing, which I did. Ask Bernie to donate his stocks.
3850 2018-01-12 19:29:56 One way to modify your risk in this market is buying a mix of bonds and stocks. And diversify. The size of the crash will be dependent on how long 45 stays. The sooner he's out, the better.
3851 2018-01-12 19:29:41 Don’t forget bank stocks making highs.
3852 2018-01-12 19:28:40 Translation: He didn't own any. Good call on the #internet - hope he didn't short any of those stocks. Bitcoin #investors are only ones "having issues"...#taxes. "I don't like to make predictions about emerging technologies, but...BITCOIN SUCKS!" #joker
3853 2018-01-12 19:28:18 I consider myself irresponsible with money, and annuity is a great safety net to ensure the bottom doesn't fall out. 

OTOH smart investments in stocks/bonds can make that lump-sum equal or larger to the proper jackpot.
3854 2018-01-12 19:28:16 Yep. Companies buying their stocks back. Walmart putting thousands out of work. And that's BEFORE the debt goes up and taxes (and health premiums) go up on all us Average Joes. You're gonna break the economy because you can't see past your noses.
3855 2018-01-12 19:27:27 #cryptocurrency is where the big gains are at in 2018. You can make more in a day than you can all year in stocks - if you know what you're doing.
3856 2018-01-12 19:27:25 @jefe_reina still babking off stocks
3857 2018-01-12 19:26:59 Durbin has been outed by two US Senators who attended the meeting.

They both report Durbin is a liar, that Trump never said the word, "Shithole."

Once again the shithole media is caught pushing  stinking Democrat lie.

Trump Wins, Again.

3860 2018-01-12 19:25:46 It's hard to argue with results:

Dems claim stocks will crash but they're on a record tear!
Dems claim ISIS can't be stopped and they're all but destroyed!
Dems claim #TCJA will hurt middle class but they're seeing bonuses, higher wages, lower utilities, and more jobs!
3861 2018-01-12 19:24:49 Do stocks have utility value?
3862 2018-01-12 19:24:44 I'm finding a lot of deals in the commodity space, though. Lots of great dividend stocks left for dead because they're "not working today."
3863 2018-01-12 19:24:38 BTW, @twitter stock is on fire again today. Think 2018 is going to be very good for company. My stock picks for 2018: Twitter, WWE, Activision, & Take Two. Have held all four stocks for years. Also, have had UnderArmour for past year.
3864 2018-01-12 19:24:27 WALLSTREET REPORTING: Stocks have gained 7 trillion (40 percent increase) in value since the result of election poll reporting win of Trump administration. Possibly breaking new record again today.

3958 2018-01-12 18:47:26 btw brother, I think $AFMD at $1.30/5 has as much potential to run...with equal risk...as any of the pot stocks.  Thanks again for all of your insight...best pot stock source on Twitter hands down.
3959 2018-01-12 18:46:52 La otra opción era seguir consumiendo otros stocks, o sea descapitalizar los 60.000 millones del FGS o privatizar activos públicos, que espero que nunca pase.

3961 2018-01-12 18:46:00 Yep. Lot of hate out their on the left. I think it really stems back to Nov '16 when trump won and they dumped their stagnant obama administration stocks. Their hate and fear is our Finacial win.
3962 2018-01-12 18:45:50 The S&P lags behind international stocks in growth, therefore a middle class tax cut is unsustainable since the very small amount of stocks middle close investors go into are primarily the S&P

3974 2018-01-12 18:41:53 Come on now let’s see how your stocks are doing under Trump and then compare it to Obama’s stock market. That’s right you want because that will prove Trump is a awesome president. You are a person that likes to live in a echo chamber.

3977 2018-01-12 18:40:18 The concern in corn at this point last year was the pure volume left to sell in farmer hands. On farm corn stocks up 130 million bushel. I'd venture to say the overwhelming majority of that is unpriced. Tourniquet's going to be distributed soon at the banking level.

3982 2018-01-12 18:37:32 It's been a good run recently for US stocks.  

However, I believe most people with a strong understanding of economics *like you Matt* understand that the government/policy is only a small piece of the action.

3986 2018-01-12 18:34:04 Incomprehensible how much stock longs think shit-hole stocks are worth when you have trump running things...
3987 2018-01-12 18:33:30 I seem to have an awful lot of different stocks, in mine, mostly chicken! I found some snails with garlic butter and some lardons! A French theme has emerged.
3988 2018-01-12 18:32:54 Hmm well my taxes back doubled. My husband got a large bonus, our stocks are doing phenomenal, and black unemployment at all time low. Mazda is building a plant in Alabama. The Koreans are on speaking terms. But the cigars Obama got us was cool too

4001 2018-01-12 18:27:41 Lo que hace la normativa es evitar la cuenta sueldo como protección de esos stocks transitorios, que si no son ahorro y provienen del salario no me imagino muchas variantes. Lo nuevo es que se diferencia el sueldo de la cuenta.
4002 2018-01-12 18:27:37 US stocks continued higher with very narrow breadth support. Stocks are still a short term sell as the profit taking will sooner or later hit these markets and gains are unlikely to hold. Long term trends remain up. $SPX
4003 2018-01-12 18:27:30 EXACTLY, I have been asking NEEL where would he like to see HIGHER PRICES? FOOD? HOUSING? AUTOS? HEALTHCARE? COLLEGE? DISNEY? OIL? STOCKS?  Neel and his FED buddies, need to understand, that thanks to social media, WE KNOW who and what they are up to..............DISHONEST CARTEL
4004 2018-01-12 18:26:43 The EU #wheat balance basically took 0.5mmt from Russian ending stocks to its own. As expected decent pull down in exports but no change to dom. Demand which should come IMO.The ending stocks not to change much and stay (relatively) tight.

4007 2018-01-12 18:26:03 Exactly. In the late 90s, you could hide in value stocks, small caps etc. Heck, you could have been safely in Treasuries earning 6.5%! There is no hiding place now. You are being smoked out.
4008 2018-01-12 18:24:47 Totally see through PR move. Dotard stocks foot in mouth looking like a grand wizard, then rolls out the 2 token black folks in his admin, and then invites all the decent black folk for some MLK holiday naming which I thought it already was

4011 2018-01-12 18:22:55 @Offhergame @JaYYmAn how sentiment works . Those same stocks went down on Jeff sessions comment and they had 0 exposure to that as well
4012 2018-01-12 18:22:49 I think plain English, it's saying will overvalued biotech stocks fall soon?
4013 2018-01-12 18:22:06 Neel would say that it's not the Fed's job to decide what the correct price for assets (stocks or *cough* bitcoin) is, and he'd be right.

4020 2018-01-12 18:18:08 Are REITs starting to become interesting? I'm fine with a 6% yield in some of the relatively safe names, even if it never grows. Feels much better than buying stocks at 27x earnings or whatever ridiculous multiple we're at now.

4027 2018-01-12 18:15:44 So one can only invest in stocks, and their rise and fall is the only indicator of economic growth and success?

4029 2018-01-12 18:14:13 Only reason the stockmarked is up is that companies buying back there own stocks.

This is undisputed and verifiable fact.

4074 2018-01-12 17:50:07 @ScottWapnerCNBC Discussing EVERYTHING the banks can do to goose their stocks even more than the 10fold increase some of them have had. EVERYTHING except paying depositors higher interest rates...

4076 2018-01-12 17:49:37 Very much agreed.  So many people sold stocks at 1 dollar that later turned to $10 plus stocks.  Thats a harsh reality...

supposedly sams clubs  haven't been performing as well as they'd like, and it brings stocks down so they -maybe- want to separate them into two different entities

4231 2018-01-12 16:58:17 Stock market & jobs are not 1:1. Stocks are up because big business got big tax cuts leading to bigger profit expectations, so the rich invested more. Zero effect on low income families, negligible effect on middle class. 1
4232 2018-01-12 16:58:07 Err no. Burnol stocks never get sold out. Otherwise how it is still available in market after Sanghis used it extensively for 67 years from 1947 to 2014!
4233 2018-01-12 16:57:54 Have you seen smth from $XBI or $IBB in last 2 tweets. No? They`re busy in buybacks and new sales of stocks instead? Maybe... But all we really knows for tdy is that no company from those 2 indexes could be positioned as breakthrough.

4263 2018-01-12 16:47:20 So why are all my bank stocks headed up?  Have we reached Nirvana and time to get out?
4264 2018-01-12 16:47:12 While I love to see the market go up, let's remember it's easier to go from 25k to 26k (4% growth) than it was to go from 10k to 11k (10% growth). So making a big deal about 1,000 point jumps isn't all that matters. #StockMarkets #stocks #Dow #MAGA
4265 2018-01-12 16:46:43 I can't find a #stock to buy that is moving up that doesn't have a P/E that isn't over 220. You can buy these overvalued stocks, I will stick to buying and shorting the $VIX What do I care about 30% in a year, when I have made over 1,200% in each of the last 3 years #stockmarket

4285 2018-01-12 16:40:05 People think Ripple is a cryptocurrency. For one, it is listed on exchanges, tickers, marketcap etc. 

Sites like coincap, cryptowatch etc should stop listing ripple, because it is just as much a "cryptocurrency" as stocks in Twitter are: not at all.
4286 2018-01-12 16:39:47 This is creating an unprecedented environment in which too much money is chasing too few assets, causing not just the phenomenon in Stocks & Cryptos, but Real Estate at + $2.2 Trillion, another record rise in one year. Now Gold and Silver are just getting started as undervalued

4295 2018-01-12 16:38:18 I would say two things.  

1- All of this known for weeks/months, & was baked in the cake 1st runup & 2nd runup back to 25
2- Both Cryptos & Crypto stocks have been WEAK last few weeks; hence, $$ coming in wasnt for ICO & wasnt just shorts covering imo (wasnt crowded to begin w/)

4357 2018-01-12 16:18:01 The pursuit of a scoop could get people killed or cause stocks to plummet...again. 

But the media will just shrug and dust their hands because they got a another zinger.
4358 2018-01-12 16:17:55 Still holding all the long individual stocks, but think I need to step off the bus of crazies for a bit.
4359 2018-01-12 16:17:55 I find this depends drastically on whether or not the overall market is bullish. As I've seen repeated before while trading stocks. "A rising tide raises all ships".
4360 2018-01-12 16:17:51 And in the real world... my Dad, who avoided the stock market under Obama, has made over 15k in the last few months from just 4 stocks. Thank you Trump! 
4361 2018-01-12 16:17:34 Red is an investor. He should be kissing trumps ass because stocks have been so high. I bet he would be complaining if Hillary were elected president. Hmmmmmmm.

4364 2018-01-12 16:16:26 The breakaway climb of growth stocks has unbalanced many investor portfolios. Is it time to trim tech and tilt back to value?
4365 2018-01-12 16:16:06 buying the other things is basically buying on guess of other people's psychology, or assumption others may do same, until 95% of the trade is momentum and psychology, and maybe no believers? synthetic penny stocks... don't be part of the problem!
4366 2018-01-12 16:16:05 I'd be curious to see how many of these evil companies' stocks are in the portfolios of Nancy and the other Dem politicians crying Armageddon.

4375 2018-01-12 16:12:30 Exactly. It is the way Cong(I) fights judiciary for reopening 1984 cases. If the 'Aggrieved' judges wanted the 'skewed' practice to stop, couldn't they have gone to President, who could have found a way out as the head of the State. Haven't the Judges made them laughing stocks?

4379 2018-01-12 16:09:43 Wrong. Wages aren’t booming. Job creation down in 2017 vs. 2016. 50% US pop doesnt own stock & top 10% pop US owns 80% of stocks, DJIA doesnt relate to most people’s wealth. Tax cut just went to top 1%, (my taxes going up). & POTUS has no respect for Constitution. Bigger issue.
4380 2018-01-12 16:09:32 $IWC Hard to be bearish stocks when micro caps are hitting all-time highs. Not a downtrend as @allstarcharts would say
4381 2018-01-12 16:09:21 Hearing whispers of stock splits, talk of issuing/selling equity and basic creation of more shares. And rates are rising. That is literally the inverse of the environment of the past 9 years. Stocks reflecting scarcity of shares compared to cash, not value
4382 2018-01-12 16:09:13 Hiking Fed Funds won’t cause stocks to sell off. Accelerating balance sheet run off (draining reserves) would do it.

4389 2018-01-12 16:05:00 No, probably shorting stocks.   If one believes we are in a super-bubble mania, best wait for cracks to show first before shorting.

4411 2018-01-12 15:58:15 All those great jobs coming back from Mexico are because Trump just gave those guys huge tax cuts! They all just got even richer!! Wall Street is doing great because the rich are getting richer!! Try looking up how many Americans actually have stocks or bonds?? #epicfail
4412 2018-01-12 15:58:11 Apparently China says they won't buy our bonds... Saudis are moving away from Petrodollars... so, all that's actually bullish cause the Fed will have to step in and buy up everything no one else will, which means QE4 which means low rates and even higher stocks

4418 2018-01-12 15:56:45 The way it just traded is a penny flippers wet dream look at the spread from low to high on the day. You will always get penny flippers on momentum stocks. But I agree the people selling to them especially below $2 is just crazy. You can lead a horse to water.
4419 2018-01-12 15:56:42 Like I been sayin, "Stocks are the new Bitcoin."

4425 2018-01-12 15:55:41 Energy looking sluggish. Think January options are sitting on some of the #natgas stocks; about 130K open call interest OTM on $SWN, for example.

4439 2018-01-12 15:52:06 Rear view mirror is always clearer than the front view mirror. I guess all investors & fund managers would want to invest in the 10 top stocks of the next 1 year.
4440 2018-01-12 15:52:00 $AMD, $MU, and $TWTR were definitely the stocks to trade this morning! Great job securing profits in $AMD and $MU. $TWTR was tough to time, 50% of traders profited on the first breakout and 50% were stopped out trading the second breakout.
4441 2018-01-12 15:51:55 If we had the above "mean reversion", one of the early symptoms would likely be stocks moving up and to the right on low volatility:)

4727 2018-01-12 14:31:25 I’m not convinced that the proposed Facebook newsfeed changes are going to have a major impact on FB Ads. Facebook stocks are slumping right now. Hamstringing their primary revenue source isn’t going to instill confidence in investors. #FBAdsChat

4729 2018-01-12 14:30:47 I’m not going to hate on what trump says. What you say and what you do are 2 completely different things. I care about results. My stocks have never been higher, border crime is down, and companies are opening plants in the United States, creating more jobs. Those are results.

4788 2018-01-12 14:10:07 any wealth storage mechanism has a risk of people not giving a damn in time. 9 years is a good run in tech. If it fails as a wealth storage mechanism too, things happen. Stocks, Fiat and others have outright failed before and people move on.

4802 2018-01-12 14:03:00 Simple fin.math example:
I buy €1M US stocks - say ES stocks - & EURUSD @ 1.10, that makes $1.1M invested when ES is 2500.
ES goes to 2750. stocks gain +10% av. -> I got $1.21M
Only EURUSD is now 1.20.
That makes €1.008M.

5116 2018-01-12 10:50:42 True that. One should always be aware not to give false advice. We are not trading stocks, so no benefits in fooling other to buy at spikes. On the other side, new investors need to pounder all the risks before buying and must be cold-headed enough to make their own decisions.

5126 2018-01-12 10:39:07 Aldous Huxley also, in the same period, advocated forced sterilisation of 'sub-normal' stocks. Fears over mass man I guess. In one essay Huxley asks, rhetorically, if it is more charitable to give a beggar alms, or to prevent his birth.

5479 2018-01-12 05:18:50 I didn't understand. Are you saying these stocks are not really worth as they might be manipulated one as they are owned by a MF. And this MF can create his own financial data of these stocks to suit his requirement. I am too bad...
5480 2018-01-12 05:18:45 N my opinion it’s really just a savings acct w/the perks of trading. The roundup feature makes it easy 2 ‘invest’. it doesnt show the actual stocks, not that I’ve seen, but it does show u the type & how much u bought. It also lets u choose the stock/fund mix u want to invest in

5482 2018-01-12 05:16:44 It goes to shareholders through dividend returns, mate. The rise is stock markets is just that, the market of stocks. When it goes up, there's greater demand for shares - meaning investors feel they will get greater returns. It's why trickle-down has never benefited lower classes

5739 2018-01-12 02:21:16 Yup, definitely. Let Orient electricals shares credited to your demat account. Market will try to evaluate both the companies valuation as and when it gets listed. Markets are making new highs, do not sell any stocks in near term(smallcaps & midcaps)
5740 2018-01-12 02:20:38 Inflation would be bad news for stocks.
5741 2018-01-12 02:20:04 They should’ve been in stocks in 2017, I say Monday morning quarterbacking.
5742 2018-01-12 02:19:21 As the great @kairyssdal always says, "the Dow is not the economy and the economy is not the Dow". He would also have me point out to you that the Dow is a select number of stocks, not the whole stock market, but that's neither here nor there. 
5743 2018-01-12 02:18:26 All true what you say but only if vacuum seal holds and stocks withstand true rising rate environment
5744 2018-01-12 02:17:57 Our baby daughter willl be born in a couple weeks. I bet that her generation will invest in $crypto over stocks / bonds.
5745 2018-01-12 02:17:49 Oil stocks had a banner day today...the NY pension fund lost billions
5746 2018-01-12 02:17:22 Problem for stocks?
5747 2018-01-12 02:17:06 Christ. The 1% of Paris owned 70% of all Parisian wealth (land, housing, stocks, money, savings) in 1913 until WW1 tanked the economy.
5748 2018-01-12 02:16:41 Yeah I don't mind some holding, gets some of the CGT tax concession time out of the way for me. Different on other stocks I know I wont hold a year but with fundamentals as strong as $SVM happy to park some money and wait.
5749 2018-01-12 02:16:07 Get this...I started with only 50 dollars in Penny stocks and now I am at 102 dollars in less than 4 days.  All i had to do was study what was being sold and bought. What was going to climb and what to buy when it dropped a lot. Dude...I think I found a new hobby....I mean JOB :D
5750 2018-01-12 02:15:32 When the president declares "the stock market is doing well" you must ask yourself, who does that benefit? Not half of American who don't own or invest in a 401K. Trump supporters don't care whether they benefit from stocks or his policies they care that POC aren't benefiting
5751 2018-01-12 02:15:05 Buffett says pension funds should be in 100 percent stocks. Yea

5755 2018-01-12 02:09:26 Ok. Let's eliminate the gun show loophole. Let's ban bump stocks or any kit designed to change a semiautomatic into an automatic weapon. Lets limit the size of magazines. Let's prevent people with a history of violence from legally buying guns.

5757 2018-01-12 02:06:04 Do you mean tax cheats such as trust fund kids that dump stocks before passing financial bills that benefit them?

5759 2018-01-12 02:05:31 I'm enjoying learning about stocks and diversification. See you at the top!
5760 2018-01-12 02:03:40 do you think poor people own stocks lmao

5762 2018-01-12 02:02:27 I'm now 2/3rds in cryptocurrencies and 1/3rd in stocks.
And 3/3rds in weed.
5763 2018-01-12 02:02:26 When Mr. Hyperinflation shows up, you'll just say it was the perfect storm. Fiat is a bubble and Bitcoin is going to pop it. Before Bitcoin, storing wealth was limited to land, stocks/bonds, gold/silver, all manipulated by middlemen. No manipulation in storing wealth in Bitcoin.
5764 2018-01-12 02:00:17 Give you so much credit. I know how hard that is. Although I do agree with you. This pull back was more severe and relentless today. Once good news hits and stocks still trend lower is my que. it happened today
5765 2018-01-12 02:00:07 Prolly drug co stocks that make opiods
5766 2018-01-12 01:59:34 Important! Thanks!

More importantly, do you oppose:

1. Current federal efforts to deregulate silencers?

2. Current federal efforts to allow Concealed Carry Reciprocity?

3. Continued legality of Bump Stocks, GAT Triggers and Hellfire Triggers?

5773 2018-01-12 01:51:57 Actually I don’t get high , but him meddling in Marijuana is messing with the stocks. But good assumption .
5774 2018-01-12 01:50:40 It's hard to hate Trump and the GOP if you own stocks..but wait until the market crashes.
5775 2018-01-12 01:50:26 Well if you need stocks there you go. I cannot wait to see what you come up with.
5776 2018-01-12 01:49:53 The ganja stocks have gone up in smoke!!
5777 2018-01-12 01:49:00 Job market is better when looking at types of jobs. Pres Trump has a freeze on any Federal jobs. Then we had 3 severe hurricanes & fires that created lower jobs. But GDP hit over 3% in 2017 & stocks are soaring. With tax cuts for 2018, America will do even better!

5786 2018-01-12 01:45:24 @stevenmnuchin1   Yo Steve.........How can you and Trump take credit for the $1000 bonuses without also taking credit for the recent layoffs?  Also, what happened in Dec with job creation stats?  Stocks up, but not as high a % as OBAMA.
5787 2018-01-12 01:45:22 Drug launches are the death of stocks.  Expectations never met.
5788 2018-01-12 01:44:41 American stocks keep hitting highs but have UNDERPERFORMED Europe and Emerging in the year since Trump took office. A global synchronous recovery is underway that has nothing to do with whoever is the US president.
5789 2018-01-12 01:44:23 Obama helped us in 08-09 as we went through a severe economic crash. The we hummed along & he doubled our debt. Now Trump is our President & GDP is over 3% & stocks are soaring. Cutting regulations & hope in America is why we are soaring now. Thank you Pres Trump.
5790 2018-01-12 01:43:15 Trumps got stocks and bonds in Pharmaceuticals do of course he's going to PROTECT them
How else could he financially GAIN  of them?
5791 2018-01-12 01:43:10 “One sparrow does not a summer make”, as it’s said in Spanish-speaking countries. Sorry but you’re dead wrong and in urgent need of a reality check.
5792 2018-01-12 01:41:58 I've recently listened to @badcrypto with @RonnieMoas. I followed up on Ronnie's comment "stocks are overvalued". I did a simple exercise of taking top companies in each sector of the S&P. Took Stock Price/PE  ratio wasn't very high ... leaving me confused. Care to expand?
5793 2018-01-12 01:41:01 When BOs , as typically seen in Multi Year BOs, midcaps stocks may hit the tgt quickly in vertical fashion. But lets keep reasonable timeline of 6-8 months.

"acting silly with the homies.. I mean investing in Esty stocks"
5795 2018-01-12 01:39:25 $50 is an obvious level-- obvious seldom works.  I like it when stocks try to breakout and then fail at obvious points and then later make another attempt.  look at  $AA $TEAM, and $WTW and you'll see what I mean (I own all 3)
5796 2018-01-12 01:39:17 trying holding a short for 20 min on higher price stocks like $ROKU you would have banked See today's charts. Scalping can have its cons ;)
5797 2018-01-12 01:39:00 My cousin invests in it. I was close but...just not willing to risk it  or spend my time watching stocks 
5798 2018-01-12 01:38:07 Second lowest measurement in the 20 years the metric has been tracked.

Stock ownership does not equate to liquidity, or cash in your pocket. These stocks are parked in retirement accounts and are not indicative of the health of our economy.

The more you know...
5799 2018-01-12 01:37:25 Vapor stocks wheels aren’t that great tbh, I usually buy all my wheels online. I’ve been rocking Lebeda’s and they’re really solid.

5801 2018-01-12 01:37:07 Don't get me started. I'm seeing less in my check when in suppose to see more. Sales are down in wireless communications since net neutrality  and my stocks are down slightly. 
5802 2018-01-12 01:35:32 I can tell that my ira retirement is doing great, stocks have broken records 5 times. i'm just saying things are going good for me. the BHO period wasn't good,but I made it and you'll make fine with this admin.
5803 2018-01-12 01:35:18 Housing should arguably be even more regulated than stocks or bonds
5804 2018-01-12 01:35:10 Quite the solid upgrade!! Nice man!
5805 2018-01-12 01:34:39 I hear you Senator, but please don't forget about the ban on "butt stocks", which NO ONE is talking about.
5806 2018-01-12 01:33:03 F#$=÷k you! Why don't  yu look atthe things he is doing!  Jobs are u, stocks are up, taxes are down.  He is taking down child traffickers and pedos
5807 2018-01-12 01:31:28 A sobering reminder to never get complacent and know where your stops are. Appreciate  the heads up. Today the starbucks barista told me that he had invested in Ethereum. Reminded me of Joseph Kennedy's shoeshine boy story causing him to sell stocks before the 1929 crash.
5808 2018-01-12 01:31:19 Spent the better half of my day finally researching stocks and how to begin investing.
5809 2018-01-12 01:31:13 Well, everyone wants to invest in banking, oil, and airline stocks.  We'll see if that narrative holds true tomorrow
5810 2018-01-12 01:30:44 yep and honestly even Keith said it was hilarious they mention that tax law. Walmart would never part with money they didn't already have & they haven't made anything with tax yet right? They only want their stocks to go higher which probably why the closings.
5811 2018-01-12 01:30:40 UPDATE 1-Results drive sharp moves in European stocks @Twelve_Banal
5812 2018-01-12 01:30:40 Well said it's the insider trading Congress is entitled to and getting IPO stocks.  Part of the bennies they get by hearing about what's coming down the road on stocks and being on the inside when they make laws.  They know first and move their stocks.  BS
5813 2018-01-12 01:30:33 That was a week ago, time flies. A biotech company. I'm now bored waiting for biotechs' phase 1-3 trials, surprise security offerings and possible buyout but it's a field where stocks can move a lot ;-)

5815 2018-01-12 01:28:49 it smelled so good and i would have ate the fries also no shame babe
5816 2018-01-12 01:28:11 i just want to know why u gave me shit for eating lap fries when ur out here eating tide pods
5817 2018-01-12 01:27:44 Obama's economy had 76 consecutive mos. of job growth 4.6% unemployment rate tripled stocks and low gas prices. Trump's fiscal yr just started Oct 1st he is simply riding the economic trend that started under Obama. Fox isn't going to tell you that, they know you don't fact check
5818 2018-01-12 01:27:42 Kyle also told me sat. that he has apparently been investing in stocks since the 1st of our relationship  like thanks for the info babe
5819 2018-01-12 01:27:10 People stand in line to buy stocks?
5820 2018-01-12 01:25:53 @FXS_Stocks_DE I am Vanguard - the first solar powered satellite into space. Now I must be first to let go.
5821 2018-01-12 01:25:43 Whenever corps lay people off, their stock goes up. So, even though lower taxes SHOULD make marginal stores be more profitable, By closing stores & plowing their windfall into their own stocks, they stand to make a LOT in dividends/capital gains, which are taxed even Lower. ^..^
5822 2018-01-12 01:23:35 Fox never admitted that Obama's economy had 76 consecutive months of job growth, 4.6% unemployment rate, tripled stocks and low gas prices. Trump's fiscal yr. just started Oct 1st, he is simply riding the economic trend that started under Obama.
5823 2018-01-12 01:23:22 Indeed ! but on a marketing standpoint it would be good for the stocks y’knoo
5824 2018-01-12 01:22:47 pray????    while bump stocks are still legal?????
5825 2018-01-12 01:21:54 Riiiight.  Automatic weapons, large magazines and bump stocks aren’t designed to kill people, they’re just designed to spray a lot of metal at high velocity.  And my oven isn’t designed to bake food, it’s just designed to warm up the air.  #gunsensemyass
5826 2018-01-12 01:21:35 Buy the way, in the book that I have read the dollar down, gold should goes up, it seems that the theory does not work, do you mean that fed are controlling bond ,stocks,gold? Every where? Is fed able to do that?
5827 2018-01-12 01:19:47 I hardly look at stocks tbh!
5828 2018-01-12 01:18:16 Sûrement qu il y a des stocks de flocages invendus de 8 et 10 en boutique 
5829 2018-01-12 01:17:58 How many Sam's Clubs closing?  And even if the investor class benefits, does that help those who are too poor to participate in the market, about 40% of our population. WE need to think and act less selfishly. Glad my stocks are doing well, but they were going to do well anyway.
5830 2018-01-12 01:17:51 I’m confused why you think the materials and equipment stocks are so positively correlated with the price of memory when the reason memory prices crash historically is due to oversupply—ie expanding fabs and buying more equipment.  ????
5831 2018-01-12 01:17:07 I just saw my 401k report.  Not too dark.  Isis being depleted, ms13 being handled, jobs, stocks, Paris agreement, tpp, we're just starting.
5832 2018-01-12 01:17:02 Only true-ish - they still have it, but the PV of future proven isn't enough to impel draining it out of the Arctic, especially when @NorgesBank decides oil company stocks (Shell, BP, Exxon, et al) are too hot to hold. No equity confidence = no CF confidence = no projects
5833 2018-01-12 01:15:52 It’s just like when someone invests in cheap stocks thinking it’s not gonna get worse than this!

5844 2018-01-12 01:07:22 @marty_walsh @MassGovernor Boston & the Commonwealth should divest it’s pension funds of fossil fuel stocks & funds. It’s just as bad as supporting tobacco companies. MA has the best healthcare in the nation & pension funds should support it.

5848 2018-01-12 01:05:49 OMG, we are the laughing stocks of the planet !
5849 2018-01-12 01:05:29 And Mary, for what it’s worth, remember that a loss isn’t a loss until you sell. I don’t know what you have, but if you haven’t sold, remember that in bio, as with other stocks, there are redemption stories.

5852 2018-01-12 01:03:08 the 'coolest' things i ever got were a secret lab map and i painted an aisha baby (that i lost access to the account for). and now that i do stocks and food club it's like.. man... i wanna live it up!!
5853 2018-01-12 01:02:31 If you are one of the ignorant people who will excuse our fake presidents comments about shithole countries by saying “but my stocks are worth more now than they ever have been”...I sincerely and emphatically would say..GO FUCK YOURSELF

5856 2018-01-12 00:58:51 Funny.  $1 trillion for stimulus and we got NOTHING.  Obamacare and we got NOTHING.  People lost their jobs, their healthcare.....but hey, your husband traded stocks on insider information....with immunity
5857 2018-01-12 00:57:44 Need the Winklevoss bros to cash in their bitcoin fortune into stocks for the final push.
5858 2018-01-12 00:57:15 yeah good resource? It seems stock TA in stocks is a whole different world than in crypto. Youtube videos talking about 29 day trends and such. This space is 29 seconds. Share a link to best tools to learn TA in this space?
5859 2018-01-12 00:56:59 I'm going to start investing in penny stocks

5861 2018-01-12 00:56:06 Why do all this recent soft bashing of pot stocks then say you’ll be shorting them in 3 months? Surely if you planned on shorting in March it would be in your best interest to have prices remain high until then?
5862 2018-01-12 00:55:48 Meesh just taught me how to get started with Stocks we making money moves 
5863 2018-01-12 00:55:37 Did I state that anyone couldn't buy stocks? No, I didn't. What I DID say was that the stock market is basically legalized gambling for the rich. Is that a lie? As to 401ks, yes I realize many people have them. However, how great will that be if they lose their jobs?
5864 2018-01-12 00:55:22 What I have discovered about $SX and $IDK is that it doesn't matter how much DD I do on them there is always more. The catalysts that these stocks have are plentiful to say the least. Also found out i don't need much sleep when on a run like this!
5865 2018-01-12 00:55:16 @realDonaldTrump @RealAlexJones I told my Dad about people wanting to contribute to building the Border Wall. He said bricks or materials for the Border Wall should be sold to the Public like Stocks. It's a good idea & raises funding then NO Deals on DACA
5866 2018-01-12 00:54:52 Since wages are going up and taxes lower. It's time to increase oil/gas profits for years to come. Get the stocks moving and dividends paying.
5867 2018-01-12 00:54:42 @vladstocks is it a website that I can go to, so I can start investing n stocks.. Help!!
5868 2018-01-12 00:54:40 And we also want to boost Jeff Session's stocks, right demented Donald?
5869 2018-01-12 00:54:03 Ironically the very reasons Norwegians don’t want to leave are the things this administration is trying to destroy here- education, health care, a social safety net. No one thinks damn I just want to move to a country that will sell me bump stocks  To hell with health care!
5870 2018-01-12 00:53:51 Weed stocks pulling back. They should be ashamed of themselves for not filing paper work on time.  I hold shares. But embarrassing to say the least
5871 2018-01-12 00:51:53 Best stocks to buy?
5872 2018-01-12 00:51:07 How does he feel about pot penny stocks actually? Real question lol
5873 2018-01-12 00:50:08 I’m seeing low P/C ratio stocks are the more bullish stocks. $BABA $AAPL $TSLA. Follow the money!
5874 2018-01-12 00:49:11 Breadth - New highs today in cumulative advance-decline for $NYSE, $NYSE common stock and $SPX.

80% of $SPX stocks are above their 50-d, the highest % in 1-1/2 yrs
5875 2018-01-12 00:48:53 I always get excited to go grocery shopping because i have a huge crush on the guy that stocks the shelves
5876 2018-01-12 00:48:53 Meatball sandwiches (in my mind best ever made by me)pepperoni and mozzarella strombolis( award winning)chips n pretzels and dip. And Stocks pound cake. Lager and Corona as well
5877 2018-01-12 00:48:51 Those stocks look interesting in back ground 
5878 2018-01-12 00:48:35 Looking at stocks
5879 2018-01-12 00:47:47 You have to keep in mind his focus is undervalued stocks. That's Berkshire MO. They also did not participate in the initial internet boom. But I do agree that many crypto coins will one day be worthless. Here is the problem with our cryptocurrency industry....
5880 2018-01-12 00:47:15 @StewPedidiot @TheWarRoom $ENPH is one of my bread and butter stocks. They had a helluva earnings the other month a drove up 125% in 2 weeks
5881 2018-01-12 00:45:42 111 is the approx neckline. It will be interesting to see what it does there. I kinda feel Gold and Silver may keep going with no pullbacks like stocks did in 2017
5882 2018-01-12 00:45:07 Some recent stocks I've made $$ trading with: rgr, blk, nbl, atvi, amd to name some.
5883 2018-01-12 00:45:04 1/ ce sont des réfugiés pas des migrants. Ils fuyent pour survivre. Que la menace soit la guerre ou la misère peu importe : c'est leur peau qu ils tente de sauver
2/ on ne gère pas des gens.  Ce verbe s emploie pour les stocks, les situations ou les choses. Pas pour les humains !
5884 2018-01-12 00:44:09 @CommSecSupport Dealing with you has proven a new level of ignorance. I requested an off-market transfer for 6 stocks and you sent to the other brokers only 2 out of 6 and now blaming me for slowing down the process? I wish I can deal with someone that can read
5885 2018-01-12 00:43:36 holy shiznit... I doubt they'd even put any penny stocks on the air.
5886 2018-01-12 00:43:29 Where’s the proof he’s in bed with Russia. The crooked media has been beating a dead horse trying to prove it for a year when the liberals have blood on their hands and get away with it! They won’t report on all the record stocks, the lowest unemployment, most jobs added in 1 yr.
5887 2018-01-12 00:43:18 I’m so embarrassed for them because the very person they criticize incessantly is the person who pays their bills. They must hate to love him.He not only keeps them working but he’s got their stocks and retirements booming. They are enslaved!
5888 2018-01-12 00:43:09 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
5889 2018-01-12 00:41:46 No, he's talking about mj stocks.
5890 2018-01-12 00:41:37 Or maybe we prefer to see our money in index funds, stocks, and carefully selected cryptos? You don’t need to be overly liquid unless you’re buying a car, a house, or a jet so why carry around money that could be making money elsewhere?
5891 2018-01-12 00:41:28 My stocks went up 7% just this month 
5892 2018-01-12 00:40:51 Not with a depressed economy, and highest taxes in the world. They could not afford it. That's the point. But we obv aren't going to change each other's minds. I'm already making $ 2,000 p/m from stocks, & it's life changing 4 us. Every day gets better. Want that 4 all of us 
5893 2018-01-12 00:40:26 I recommend we bring bac k stocks so we can throw crap at him
5894 2018-01-12 00:39:55 My bank account looks good, my stocks are up, and great tax plan, feel bad for the people who never saved money
5895 2018-01-12 00:39:50 That person is gone you didn't have to delete their stocks like that 
5896 2018-01-12 00:39:49 I have confidence that you don't want to go to jail. Taxes drive demand for dollars, not confidence. You need them to pay your taxes just like everyone else. Federal gov doesn't accept bitcoin, gold, stocks, or chickens as payment, just USD.
5897 2018-01-12 00:39:34 Idk anything about stocks
5898 2018-01-12 00:39:21 I’m gna start investing in stocks my money always goin somewhere anyway
5899 2018-01-12 00:38:42 This guy in Safeway has a teardrop/money tattoo on his face and I assume that means he killed it in stocks.
5900 2018-01-12 00:37:02 Chinese leaked yesterday RE Treasury buying...stocks pooed instantly...PetroYuan is 5 years in the making...this is NO SMALL situation and I see NO PRESS on it.  Your dates and MTF picking it up from VXX to USO to SPX et al...something to it.  Keep doing you - validation of MTF
5901 2018-01-12 00:36:37 "...Do we need Clearinghouses or 3 days to buy/sell stocks? ... We have a better idea... Blockchain may work... It could disrupt lots of things" Bob Pisani, @CFAPHL #forecastdinner
5902 2018-01-12 00:36:32 I have a decent retirement account setup through work, and frankly anything involving stocks right now terrifies me. Something’s gonna happen,
5903 2018-01-12 00:34:36 Lol don’t ever take advice from CNBC. They  do the same crap with stocks. Shill with no plan, no exit strategy etc.  they are dangerous
5904 2018-01-12 00:34:33 You're reading fiction (fake news). If you look at the graphs, stocks have been rising since Barack Obama's tenure. Mr. Obama has higher job creation. Don't walk around with so much puffery. @AliVelshi
5905 2018-01-12 00:33:43 For microcaps and penny stocks, I insist on a 3% per day cut off while committing 1/4 of standard position...
5906 2018-01-12 00:31:28 @dblup  Most stocks have been way up including $NVDA and $BOTZ. I guess within the next couple of weeks we could pull back 3% at some point.
5907 2018-01-12 00:30:17 My dad is president of the US dollar and says he'll only let me buy stocks or real estate :/// can't wait to move out of this stupid house
5908 2018-01-12 00:30:15 If you actually try and get a worthwile major, learn how to apply for jobs, build life skills, and think long term, you will win on your investment compared to if you never went to college at all. It’s the equivalent of keeping money in stocks compared to the bank.
5909 2018-01-12 00:28:27 And I bet all of the employees would give up their raise to keep those being laid off if they could. That is who this country is. I don’t want a tax cut that takes from the poor so the wealthy can buy more stocks. That is not who we are. We care about all people
5910 2018-01-12 00:27:55 I’d consider college like any normal investment. It’s risky if you play your cards wrong. You could party, not go to class, pick a crappy major, and not think long term, it’s the equivalent of buying random stocks with no future planning or research.

5912 2018-01-12 00:26:37 I tested with my leftist prentend account and I'm indeed, shadow banned.   Sold my Twitter stocks a moment ago and will publish this info everywhere outside of Twitter and watch their stocks go down in a ball of flame
5913 2018-01-12 00:24:42 So I got a couple racks to invest in some stocks and some crypto but the body’s sounding better and better. Who tryna hit some blackjack

5917 2018-01-12 00:21:25 Your graphs can say whatever they want but Americans can FEEL it in their pockets ,see it in their stocks & 401K's!
5918 2018-01-12 00:21:15 Should buy stocks in muller!

5920 2018-01-12 00:20:36 Can anyone guess what FANG Stocks are no google cheating have a guess 
5921 2018-01-12 00:20:23 Just wrapped a killer conversation with @ImBallinNeal18. Talked about his rookie season, but also about some of the start-ups he's launching, how he learned to trade stocks, and his thoughts on cryptocurrency.
5922 2018-01-12 00:19:58 Tons of stocks moving up (risk on day), but I'll post a few that look poised for more as the broader market keeps ramping.
5923 2018-01-12 00:19:52 On my experience in stocks, splits are usually good.  Makes shares more affordable for new money.
5924 2018-01-12 00:18:45 They are trying desperately to keep fading viewership. People are fleeing stocks and jumping to Cryptocurrency. It’s sad watching @cnbc now. I predict a whole new segment coming soon covering crypto.

5929 2018-01-12 00:14:54 I bought $10 worth of #bitcoin 2-years ago, it's now worth $1,000.... You're got a forecasting genius right here. I'm also the same man who bought $2,000 worth of tech stocks in '99 just before the bubble burst and now have nothing. #Genius
5930 2018-01-12 00:14:47 its still in a bullish formation. stocks move in periods of rapid expansion and then long periods of distribution and rest. like in nature. expansion and contraction. XVG expanded vertically 1000% or whatever ridiculous number, now its gotta rest.
5931 2018-01-12 00:14:16 Not in stocks and was employed before he took office. Thx tho.
5932 2018-01-12 00:14:13 My big bro sent me money to invest in stocks today
5933 2018-01-12 00:14:08 Penny stocks?
5934 2018-01-12 00:13:44 Does anyone have info on what is inside @acorns porfolio? 

What stocks is acorns specifically investing folks monies in?
5935 2018-01-12 00:13:16 Given the number of stories I’m now seeing about a “new normal” and stocks being poised to rise another 100%, it’s quite possible that the market could end 2018 below the level it was at when Trump was elected.
5936 2018-01-12 00:12:42 Our Tax $$ paid for everything you can think of! They used tax dollars to open large companies(Google etc.)banks, stocks etc.  then sat back & collected the profits becoming multi billionaires.  Then we paid again to use them. They Double dipped?  See all the CEO's resigning?
5937 2018-01-12 00:10:39 Tfw your stocks actually do real well for once.
5938 2018-01-12 00:10:33 Most people when there’s a bad storm coming stock up on milk and other essentials, but not Hunter’s mom. Erika stocks up on liquor and wine 
5939 2018-01-12 00:08:29 funny thing is any coin wouldve got them money if they actually knew what stocks n trades are all about haha........#mcafee 
5940 2018-01-12 00:07:04 Asia stocks begin with a positive tone as region takes impetus from the gains on Wall St. where all major indices posted fresh record levels heading into earnings season and with energy outperforming as oil posted 3 year highs. ASX 200 (+0.2%),  Nikkei 225 (+0.1%), KOSPI (+0.4%)
5941 2018-01-12 00:06:31 $AVZ opened nicely shaking of yesterday #ausbiz #lithium #resources #stocks #monsterofmanono #China #markets #ASX
5942 2018-01-12 00:06:09 Maybe next month I'll start investing and buy stocks...if i knew how to buy and sell stocks at the right time. I should really get a book on it.
5943 2018-01-12 00:06:07 When ALL your stocks are down, except the one on your ticker that you don’t own… fucking Bezos.
5944 2018-01-12 00:05:34 Lots of different answers from pennies to Dollars! But both MJ & Crypto are very Hot Sectors other penny stocks did run to $1.00 like INTV etc.

5946 2018-01-12 00:03:19 Is there a fund consisting of weed related stocks I can invest in?
5947 2018-01-12 00:03:01 Safer investments like established stocks, can still lose money. Well-established and in an old industry with a proven market, #GeneralMotors went bankrupt in 2009
5948 2018-01-12 00:02:36 I found a link that allows you to search for which Dollar General stocks Jolt Cola. #thefuture
5949 2018-01-12 00:01:02 Wow - I noticed that private prison stocks SOARED when DT was elected. It seems that incarceration is the modus of operating + making it a money-maker at the same time. I heard books banned, no more family packages - just from 6 giant vendors (who give kickbacks to the prison).
