4 2019-02-18 23:56:54 Should we hang her, do you think, or would a few days in the stocks suffice?

9 2019-02-18 23:54:51 Biggest trouble with stocks like BAL is so many are under water on it. Very hard to get upward traction when holders are in the red from $22! Vwap is on 8.42 right now. $RB update on China may have spooked the milk co’s here. BAL reports next week.
10 2019-02-18 23:54:25 I'm not on the Trump train. He signed two giant spending bills, used tariffs, talked about it being a good idea to take someone's guns, without them being convicted of a crime, banned bump stocks, and more. None of those things are Constitutional or Conservative. I'm disappointed
11 2019-02-18 23:53:10 @foxs_biscuits why are your Sports shortcake biscuits so difficult to find in shops?? I swear nowhere stocks them anymore :( me and my dad love them so much that when we find them we stock up and buy about 10 packets to last us
12 2019-02-18 23:52:31 No, because if you look at CNNs Ratings, Trump is the only thing keeping most of Liberal Media (to include Print) in the black right now.
Good thing is, when Trump is gone, they won't have anyone to blame anymore and stocks will go through the floors across media platforms.

14 2019-02-18 23:51:12 I do hope you realise that both your vessels and ours (Falkland Islands) have to be licenced to fish on the high seas?
However, in the past, you have allowed your vessels to decimate stocks such as Southern Blue Whiting.
In fact you have encouraged such acts, in your attempts..
15 2019-02-18 23:50:50 split the stocks 50/50
16 2019-02-18 23:47:59 Except the retired person has worked 65 or was it 67 now, oh wait you pricks in parliament want to make it 70 for pension eligibility. No way. I’m putting money into dividend stocks so I have something to live on and can take advance of franking credits in my older years.

19 2019-02-18 23:45:45 Prob is I was in with 10k out with 15k both times. Past penny stocks have burned me badly enough that it's tough to sleep with 10k in one. Although, I do think this one's heading to .10-.15 cent range soon enough
