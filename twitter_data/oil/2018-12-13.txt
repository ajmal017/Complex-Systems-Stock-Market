1 2018-12-13 23:59:36 Actually, the oil sands have been getting assistance from Liberal governments since the mid-70s, and the current TM pipeline was a Liberal government project that began life as a 1951 Crown corporation (to help post-Leduc) before being sold to the private sector.

3 2018-12-13 23:59:30 I was just thinking about how just a few months ago I was watching a news segment with an analyst saying “oil can easily go to $150 in the next few weeks”  Great post as always Tom

6 2018-12-13 23:59:04 Sponsored by Enbridge and TransCanada.  Recommends subsidies for EITE, like fossil fuel industry.    I'm sure they are very much in favour of it.  Oil sands emissions are allowed to increase to 100Mt/year. Obviously they aren't afraid of carbon pricing.
7 2018-12-13 23:59:00 We don't need their oil.  This is all about Trump making money for himself
8 2018-12-13 23:58:39 as we continue to watch the egotistical Quebec government back pedal on its Alberta Dirty Oil, Liberals are now throwing more taxpayer money to look the other way while illegal border crossers travel through their neighborhoods.  Alberta is time to separate.. enough is enough

15 2018-12-13 23:57:21 Sadly as an environmentalist I am only too aware of the financial impact of oil. Sadly oil is not over. Answer me this, are people opening new oil fields. 

Bear in mind that you have already told me oil is finished and I now Don't believe any thing you say
16 2018-12-13 23:57:12 Still up burning midnight oil
17 2018-12-13 23:56:49 I agree, but law suits against oil companies are going to be a thing going forward.

41 2018-12-13 23:56:25 Weren’t you responsible for a massive loss of wildlife and gross pollution of the Gulf of Mexico.... or was that some other oil polluting multimnational?
42 2018-12-13 23:56:25 Simple fix — kale chips. Lightly coat in olive oil, spread on cookie sheet and bake at 375 until crispy. Add salt and whatever other seasoning you want. We got the kids into kale this way. Not as healthy but tastes good.
43 2018-12-13 23:56:24 looking like the Gulf War oil spill
44 2018-12-13 23:56:14 Didn’t have hair antifreeze oil, so I’m using my mans beard oil
45 2018-12-13 23:56:11 Has anyone else noticed the Democrats are pissed off when gas prices lower? It’s like they’re egging the Saudi’s to raise gas again. Do they get kick backs from high oil prices? Asking for a friend.
46 2018-12-13 23:56:04 ethically sourced fur/ leather that comes from a sustainable source and is well made enough to last more than a decade  > cheap pleather and faux fur made using sweatshop labor and oil that’ll end up in a landfill in six months
47 2018-12-13 23:55:43 why can’t oil changes wait until AFTER xmas
48 2018-12-13 23:55:38 De la misma forma que es correcta hablar del dialecto parisino de las Lenguas de oïl como francés o el dialecto toscano como italiano.
49 2018-12-13 23:55:27 Gas prices in Washington state are through the roof. Average price of gas is 3.29. How is that energy efficiency? Gas, electricity, oil and natural gas are incredibly high here because we have a good economy here. Not fair.
50 2018-12-13 23:55:18 2 tbsp Gochujang, 1 tbsp sesame oil, sugar to your taste, sesame seeds, and 1-2 tbsp water.

54 2018-12-13 23:54:57 Handcuffing the mvmnt further by only allowing low cap ventures in seems counterintuitive. The $ commitments needed to produce anything sustainable and marketable is too great for a #Kickstarter campaign to succeed. It’s hardly economical as is compare Standard Oil to Solendra
55 2018-12-13 23:54:47 Russia has oil. Russia has Trump. Do the math
56 2018-12-13 23:54:36 But we're talking size, not per capita. France is a bit bigger than the UK; both are much poorer than, for instance, Norway.
Norway's oil-based SWF is worth 330 years' worth of national expenditure.
Where's the UK's N Sea oil SWF? 
57 2018-12-13 23:54:35 Do you know why forests are being cut down for palm oil? 

It's because that palm fruit pays for the pencils children need for school, pays for the rice they eat at lunch after being up since 3 to help their parents in the plantation 

Foreign aid has many functions #orangutans
58 2018-12-13 23:54:31 @PnPCBC #cdnpoli Why no one dares to say it that all #Alberta problems now are from their own doing for the last 20 years? See how Norway manages its oil reserves.

61 2018-12-13 23:54:08 disgusting disregard to human life. The USA was quick to rush off to iraq to boot Saddam out because of his "inhumane" behaviour, so why u letting Xi Jinping run amok? is it cos China doesn't have oil? idiots
62 2018-12-13 23:54:05 @bww COMPLAINT!! Queens, NY / 107-16 71st Ave ordered, 2 drinks, appetizer and traditional wings. Ordered at 5:45pm, now 6:50pm all we got 2 drinks and appetizers. Waiter said dropped the wings now in the oil for order. Everyone after us got their food and wings. BAD SERVICE!!!!
63 2018-12-13 23:53:51 CBD oil is amazing
64 2018-12-13 23:53:44 Kevin Brady, US Rep from Texas, is labeling green tax deductions as loopholes for the rich although he lowers taxes on top 1% and businesses. Texas? Ring a bell? Energy & oil - who falls for his weasel ideas? I don’t! Texas hates green energy & cars.
65 2018-12-13 23:53:42 Is it homophobic to say Trump is in bed with Putin? What if we switch around the genders and say Hillary is in bed with Netanyahu? Or Pence is in bed with Big Oil? The underlying meaning has nothing to do with heterosexuality vs homosexuality. It’s about corruption
66 2018-12-13 23:53:40 Love urself and the earth: 
Use natural oils to moisturize after u shower! 

olive oil is even better for ur skin than coconut oil, and neithen contain glycerin - found in most lotions & moisturizing products, and almost always derived from ecologically-devastating palm oil.
67 2018-12-13 23:53:38 Bad canned tuna is evil but decent tuna (in oil>>>in brine) is versatile, tastey and 100% not a fishy disgrace
68 2018-12-13 23:53:29 I guarantee  you Senator,leave fingerprints ,Chuck Schumer is in on this. He's Netanyahu's errand boy and when know the oil industry , the Saudis and the Netanyahu Government are as thick as thieves -which is another reason why Schumer picked "GOP Joe Manchin" for Energy Chair.
69 2018-12-13 23:53:28 Meeting even 5% of Lagos food requirement will ensure that Oyo state will NEVER need federal allocation to run. 
What is oil if you can supply #150m worth of food daily
70 2018-12-13 23:53:26 ngl Bob's ornament painting is pretty damn good. Looks like an oil painting, and would definitely pay three digits for them
71 2018-12-13 23:53:23 On that oil.

74 2018-12-13 23:53:10 Thank you! No oats, raisins, honey, or syrup in my seclusion. But your flour suggestion while i looked for ingredients made me decide to brown a little butter, add the oil and flour, whisk in some milk and make #GreenGravy. i'll try to take pics.
75 2018-12-13 23:53:05 @AnankSwans
76 2018-12-13 23:52:44 Coconut oil as an overnight treatment is awesome. All the women in my family have been using it for years. Massage it in and put a cap on overnight. I would do it at least one to two nights a week tbh.
77 2018-12-13 23:52:41 Should have just taken to Twitter in the first place. Squeaky wheel gets the oil and all that. #GoodLuck
78 2018-12-13 23:52:40 Tea tree oil
79 2018-12-13 23:52:37 We are oil self sufficient for 1 month and look what happens, weird.
80 2018-12-13 23:52:17 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.
81 2018-12-13 23:52:03 Hand outs...big deal. He also killed any hope of further investment in Alberta oil. Less revenue, more expenses - that is classic Trudeau economics. You going to blame Scheer when he has to cut spending to clean up idiot clown boy’s economic mess?
82 2018-12-13 23:52:01 I'm not, oil is over and done with everyone is scaling down it's over the fat lady is singing
83 2018-12-13 23:51:59 passive aggressively refer to me as Oil

88 2018-12-13 23:51:25 Paul Mitchell is good or try a hot oil treatment.
89 2018-12-13 23:51:23 How much did the oil industry donate to Trump's campaign and inauguration to get what they wanted. Everybody else did. Coal,   Russians, oil, AT&T, theres a ton more.
90 2018-12-13 23:51:07 Yah spec... love your hockey reporting but everyone in oil country knows you are a liberal prick.. it’s a joke and call it how it is brother, never mind how long it’s been going on for
91 2018-12-13 23:51:01 
92 2018-12-13 23:50:47 Don't disagree, yet until oil is no longer a world commodity, Iran remains the world's number one sponsor of terrorism, and Islam refuses a reformation, the Western world either deals with it over there or see it eventually hit us even harder than 9/11. (imho)
93 2018-12-13 23:50:43 you are sutiya

96 2018-12-13 23:50:13 so you will be happy and 'satisfied' if kamalnath is not CM? Thats it????
97 2018-12-13 23:50:10 The oil industry will stop at nothing to wreck the planet— nothing.
98 2018-12-13 23:50:07 So what severe  sanctions will the REPUBS pass to send a message to the saudis. A total ban on the sale and supply of arms, weapons and ALL related Parts should be the next course of action. As a bonus throw in oil too ! We don’t need it !
99 2018-12-13 23:50:05 Those shorts are way too determined to be intellectually honest. Big oil undercurrent.
100 2018-12-13 23:49:57 threw some tea tree oil in my aztec clay mask & my pores are thanking me 
101 2018-12-13 23:49:46 Wait, doesn’t it take some time for the expensive stuff to work through the system? That’s what they tell us when oil prices fall.
102 2018-12-13 23:49:45 9

Topic Media should discuss more is welfare to corporate welfare queen parasites - over $20 trillion since Reagan became President and harm it has caused - welfare to Nestle, Comcast, prescription drugs, banks, oil, coal, electricity, Apple, Amazon, etc
103 2018-12-13 23:49:35 Right but here’s the difference 

The “ breaks” oil companies get .. it pays off with the money made from the oil ...

Which sparks investors/investment 

Which sparks jobs and more money going to Ottawa 

Kinda like the stock market

No incentive... no investment
104 2018-12-13 23:49:27 The IPCC is right about the climate risks but you are also right that there is nothing remotely as effective as oil and gas for transportation or many industrial processes.
105 2018-12-13 23:49:27 IMO, Big Oil, gas, coal, fossil fuel Russian Republican Petrostate will manufacture another war to stop renewables. Especially Russia. “A Terrible Place” ab’t Moscow trying 2b a modern city in 2008 & then wonder what happened when price of oil hit $25 in 2014-15.

108 2018-12-13 23:49:14 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
109 2018-12-13 23:49:10 It doesn't matter if where carbon emissions of fossil fuels comes from, whether is trucks, cars, aircraft or coal or oil burning power plants.These same emissons are drastically changing the composition of the Earth's atmosphere so that heat is trapped more readilly.
110 2018-12-13 23:49:05 What I hear is - oh sure the NDP is nice enough but we can’t afford them! 
The UCP will end the budget deficit and lower taxes!
And raise the world price of oil! And slay Justin and Ottawa!
111 2018-12-13 23:48:44 It’ll last as long as oil.
112 2018-12-13 23:48:42 So Mr. Trudeau dictates global oil prices? Wow, who knew.
113 2018-12-13 23:48:21 I mean... that's pretty funny though.
114 2018-12-13 23:48:18 Repeat after me: McDonalds fryer oil is not shampoo
115 2018-12-13 23:48:13 Have you ever looked up the circumstances that lead to the ousting of the last Iranian Shah and the Islamic Revolution there?

Hint: There was oil involved.
116 2018-12-13 23:47:23 IN WHAT WORLD ARE ANY OF THESE A GOOD OPTION..... the oil girls have really lost their minds
117 2018-12-13 23:47:19 The Golden Spruce is a great read.  I totally agree, the Hecate Straight and waters around Haida Gwaii are no place for crude oil tankers.
118 2018-12-13 23:47:18 BJP is GANDU party could not prosecute, punish and eliminate any enemy of Bharat or enemy of HSJB (Hindu,Sikh,Jain,Budh). They could not crush Gandi-family, kejdibaal
@narendramodi @AmitShah @amitmalviya @BJP4India @Swamy39 @girirajsinghbjp @RSSorg @sambitswaraj
119 2018-12-13 23:47:17 No, Fox News, even though we export as much oil as we import, these high gas prices are not good for our economy. And further, No, we don't have inexpensive gas. It's high. If there was free market competition and not this fake inflated oil commodity market, gas would be $1.00
120 2018-12-13 23:47:13 Too late. The oil barons are already Energy Barons. They always have been.
121 2018-12-13 23:46:42 I'm from #Aberdeen I know all about oil
122 2018-12-13 23:46:32 The only people (well mostly) that even go to Whistler are rich anyway. They can just their rate and let the people pay for it themselves. How about the oil companies start banning who can use their products and see how that goes
123 2018-12-13 23:46:24 He swallowed, somehow not even slightly soothed, the feeling of clotted oil remaining in his throat.
He fell back on the bed again, exhaling desperately, sharply, his hands covering his face --
124 2018-12-13 23:46:21 I was excited to get a repeat order today for not 1 but 3 bottles of CBD oil. My customer liked it so well and how it helped him with pain he wanted to buy some for some family members.  
This stuff is truly amazing 
125 2018-12-13 23:46:19 I follow a person on YouTube who doesn't cook with salt, oil, or sugar
She claims after a couple weeks you start to taste the "natural sweetness" of food but man I don't know tbh
126 2018-12-13 23:46:18 Yes, but, while the whales can successfully avoid both thousands of container ships, as well as dozens of coal ships. It's the oil tankers that they keep running into. Perhaps we should disguise the tankers as coal freighters, and that might solve the problem ... </sarcasm>
127 2018-12-13 23:46:06 I was offered it but said no thanks - managed to keep mine under control and really cleared it up with acnecide and oil free moisturiser. I’m waffling now, g’night. Haha
128 2018-12-13 23:46:03 Check your Transmission oil today.
129 2018-12-13 23:45:28 Yes, let's really alienate them now. Saudi Arabia is apparently already planning a nice oil shock for us, so let's push them to do it.
130 2018-12-13 23:45:28 Tfw I'm legit looking into getting beard oil 
131 2018-12-13 23:45:14 Oil... Sorry, Lotion dey your head.
132 2018-12-13 23:45:03 You're crazy! That's like suggesting that both gulf wars were driven by oil and not toppling a dictator! Oh, wait...
133 2018-12-13 23:44:50 Bullshit reek like oil leak
134 2018-12-13 23:44:48 I am still waiting for an answer o.
135 2018-12-13 23:44:47 If you only read @CNBC - you’d think the economy stopped Nov 1. Simply b/c stocks corrected. 

Fact is it didn’t stop. Unemployment at record lows, wages rising, oil low, rates staying low

#Trump created a mess with media   None of them will say anything supportive for > 5 min
136 2018-12-13 23:44:40 Big Oil trying to kill $TSLA via shorting the share, which inevitably will force Tesla to produce less Model 3's. Right.
137 2018-12-13 23:44:39 Federal aid to Alberta:
$250M direct aid to offset low oil prices
$500M additional for job re-training
$3.3B for infrastructure investment
$4.5B pipeline investment
138 2018-12-13 23:44:15 We use veg oil at work and at Flamingo Land everything was suitable for gluten free/dairy free/deliciousness free. I'm positive you were grand.
139 2018-12-13 23:44:00 i have dry very acne prone skin and i use jojoba oil and vaseline, i swear it keeps my skin so hydrared, i put it on at night before asleep with aloe vera underneath and i swear it helps in little ways that add up
140 2018-12-13 23:44:00 こんな時間までおふとぅんでゴロゴロしてるやばーーい…寝癖直さないとやばーい…
141 2018-12-13 23:43:48 Half of my sweaters have permanent butter and oil stains. #thankslandmark #movietheatrelife
142 2018-12-13 23:43:44 No. Like most politicians in Oklahoma he is bought and paid for by energy companies. Big oil. The same ones that killed american Indians so they didnt have to pay then royalties
143 2018-12-13 23:43:41 Olive oil + 3 eggs + 1 table spoon of sugar apply them gently you'd be fine by tomorrow
144 2018-12-13 23:43:38 Oil 
That's cool it's David Floyd haddix from Portland Oregon
145 2018-12-13 23:43:32 Oh, i couldn't handle dealing with those clowns.  I had indirect communication with Sen. Murkowski/Alaska when trying to deal with crude oil out of Alaska and she rubbed me the wrong way.  Just saying.  All of them are arrogant and pompous !
146 2018-12-13 23:43:25 Either butter or olive oil. Don't want that shit sticking do you!
147 2018-12-13 23:43:17 صح حياة.... دمهم مش أغلى من دم القوى الأمنية.
148 2018-12-13 23:43:07 私！！！！ぱっつん丸眼鏡！！！しゅき！！！！！！！
149 2018-12-13 23:42:58 omg i hate me. brought my truck to walmart so they could tighten my oil filter thingy & im just like pls ignore all the noises it makes ok just turn the radio up 
150 2018-12-13 23:42:53 CBD oil for inflammation in your joints. Any one tried it?
151 2018-12-13 23:42:51 LISTEN. palestinian olive oil is superior to italian. thx for coming to my ted talk
152 2018-12-13 23:42:46 @KOSullivanIT Canada oil patch reopen asbestos mines/some whaling. France NCT regulations a joke/Old Nuclear. Germany coal plants and dodgy Auto fraud and Siemens big corruption fine in EU. @EamonRyan @RichardbrutonTD Ireland needs to improve but not take back seat to those 3
153 2018-12-13 23:42:34 hmm I think the only essential oil I have is Jojoba. But this is GOOD information thank you!!  I may give myself a little project hhehehe
154 2018-12-13 23:42:31 More cronies in oil, for sure (gee, I wonder why?!) everywhere else is dem dominated. But I despise them left or right.
155 2018-12-13 23:42:28 Oil bosses in reef rescue meetings, prosecution of Witness K & lawyer, John Lloyd dodged investigation over IPA links, Peter Tonagh to review ABC while under investigation for billion-dollar Federal contract mystery, Minerals Council sponsored trips at Minister's request. Etc etc
156 2018-12-13 23:42:15 The squeaky wheels get the oil. As a remainer I'll simply leave.
157 2018-12-13 23:41:49 The biggest reason I need myself a man is to remind me to get my oil changed!!!!!!
158 2018-12-13 23:41:48 No just one where England threatens Scots then realises they stole some (oil bearing) seabed, so the courts will stuff them there, and Scotland is the only home for England's WMDs and we're gonna screw between 5 and 8 BILLION per annum in rent until you take your WMDs elsewhere.
159 2018-12-13 23:41:48 Good news about greater accountability by big agribusiness firm Wilmar in reducing deforestation for palm oil.
160 2018-12-13 23:41:43 hunn.. there’s the de-slick oil control one now  amazing! try it out! 
161 2018-12-13 23:41:31 2/ And I'm angry that Albertans are so deluded as to think that the oil industry has their interests in mind when, in fact, they serve shareholders and executives, as all corporations do. The oil industry caused this supply glut, not government.
162 2018-12-13 23:41:31 i spilled olive oil all over my toast and now my stomach is yelling at me
163 2018-12-13 23:41:26 Shit!!!! Hahahaha
164 2018-12-13 23:41:19 Goes to Honda for an oil change
Service advisor: well we checked and u need a new radio 
Me: if you don’t give me my dam keys
165 2018-12-13 23:41:14 @PnPCBC As a Calgarian, I'm so tired of hearing about this oil Crisis. Our past, present Premiers are to blame. If they built 1-2 refineries in Alberta the last 3-10 years, we wouldn't be in this mess. Blaming the Feds. for our lack to invest in our main industry is our fault.
166 2018-12-13 23:41:07 がんばろー！
167 2018-12-13 23:40:56 So the globalist bankers divest from big oil and are pulling the green wagon now? 8 trillion or so? Guess we free energy tech will stay on the black shelf another hundred years.
168 2018-12-13 23:40:56 And Americans will not stand still for a President who tells the world that we are in the Middle East for cheap oil and to sell arms to the Saudis. My son could have died in Desert Storm. Other men's sons did. And in the invasion and occupation of Iraq.
169 2018-12-13 23:40:49 Spray Olive oil on it, nuke it for two min...
170 2018-12-13 23:40:49 Haha! I didn’t even mention Beto, but you attacked him anyway. He lives in TX. Of course he gets oil money. Bernie wouldn’t even release his full taxes. Why? Every candidate needs to release 10 years worth. I’m tired of them hiding stuff.
171 2018-12-13 23:40:47 小学校の朝のマラソンでウルトラソウル流れてて不覚にも草でした
172 2018-12-13 23:40:44 Every renewable is built with oil, gas and  coal energy input. You can't get around it. The energy return on investment including land, money,  energy etc of renewables is absolutely terrible. The best is actually coal.
173 2018-12-13 23:40:41 いってらっしゃーい！
174 2018-12-13 23:40:39 I'm angry that the ABPCs squandered AB's resource wealth by handing out flat-taxes for a purported AB Advantage and even when oil was $100/bbl, drained the Heritage Trust Fund of income because low taxes were the priority. /2
175 2018-12-13 23:40:39 I was thinking of buying one of those air wick essential oil things as well but didn’t know if they were any good
176 2018-12-13 23:40:29 It is also a major exporter for fossil fuels in particular oil.   Let refuse to buy its oil.
177 2018-12-13 23:40:27 放置してる！考え出したら止まらないし、今までずっと仲良しだった友達とこんな理由で別れたくないな〜って心の隅っこで思うから、放置！ちょっと距離を置いて気持ちリセットするとあーやっぱ面白いわって思えてる！今のところ！！！
178 2018-12-13 23:40:22 the best way to clean glue off your frontal is with oil, alcohol & a toothbrush.
179 2018-12-13 23:40:19 I'm on tylenol, CBD oil, and prednisone for what may be some shit called polymyalgia rheumatica that I was just tentatively diagnosed with yesterday. I'm truly old, you youngsta.
180 2018-12-13 23:40:10 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
181 2018-12-13 23:40:00 Seriously- if Scandanavia was full Georgist and loosened restrictions on labor markets a bit, it would be basically untouchable. Look at what just a little bit of Georgism has done for Norway in collection of oil revenues.
182 2018-12-13 23:39:35 Thanx Anne, I've been saying the same thing for over two years! He's NOTHING but a 'Snake Oil Salesman'. He was the BIGGEST crook in NY. AND we DON'T want him back!
183 2018-12-13 23:39:26 good christ idk if this strain of oil is making me overly emotional but i just watched the ending to Your Name three times trying to find something and somehow managed to talk myself out of full on BAWLING three full times.
184 2018-12-13 23:39:15 It’s a weird psychological barrier for me. Paying $300 to frame a $2000 oil painting seems completely reasonable, but paying the same to frame a $40 print seems like an ostentatious waste of money. 
185 2018-12-13 23:39:14 Sana olive oil 
186 2018-12-13 23:39:13 Péréquation payments are in the Constitution,the one Québec didnt sign for
Put there by 9 provinces,Alberta included
Legault can say what he wants about oil
Kenney can say were moochers,
free speech
As long as Québec is there
It says and does what it wants within its juridiction
187 2018-12-13 23:38:57 who dumped oil on you?
188 2018-12-13 23:38:33 More importantly-- Syria! The U.S. is illegally occupying the gas and oil producing parts of Syria that is hampering efforts of the Syrian government to rebuild the country- allowing hundreds of thousands of their own people to return.
189 2018-12-13 23:38:32 An oil resort! No less!
190 2018-12-13 23:38:25 wow- kudos to Ann Cantrell among others.  so basically, they are trading land that will be of no use to them underwater for some prime oil laden real estate in the Shore?
191 2018-12-13 23:38:19 Here’s a REALITY CHECK! Oil & natural gas are the main source of energy for millions of people and generate revenue/income for same. renewal energy (solar & wind) is a nobel idea but current technology only can generate 10% in comparison! #MAGA
192 2018-12-13 23:38:07 But you don't drink olive oil, correct? Preparation is everything
193 2018-12-13 23:37:46 In vegetable oil. She was mortified when I told her all Yorkshire chips were cooked in dripping.
194 2018-12-13 23:37:31 i’m bad at cooking but i do have one piece of hard-won wisdom to share: cook pierogies in 2/3 butter, 1/3 oil
195 2018-12-13 23:37:16 I don’t trust a person who dabs the oil off the cheese on pizza with a napkin 
196 2018-12-13 23:37:07 Sustainable palm oil is still only a tiny fraction of the market. The rest is gathered unsustainably from old growth forests that have been there longer than we have.
197 2018-12-13 23:36:50 Enjoy! I have a facial oil on my desk for “OMG this central heating though” moments. Also rate the self tan drops you add to moisturiser.
198 2018-12-13 23:36:45 I don’t think guys understand how much effort we put in to go out

Like I have had my brows waxed & tinted, I’ve dermaplaned, did 3 face masks this week and went to sleep slathered in homemade whipped body & facial oil.

My Xmas party isn’t until Saturday.
199 2018-12-13 23:36:37 Google this phrase "new oil fields north sea"
200 2018-12-13 23:36:36 No mind am na, he think na by those oil pumped chest he has.... Trust we Nigerians na we not scared to lose in a fist fight.... Beat am well, punch those face,yeye white fool
201 2018-12-13 23:36:31 Stop hiding behind religion. GOP is no more religious than snake oil salesmen. Stop taking money from the NRA.
202 2018-12-13 23:36:17 this tweet is for my fellow uglies but i started mixing tea tree oil in my face lotion and now i have like no pimples even though i do drugs and sleep in my makeup almost every night. 
203 2018-12-13 23:36:14 I live in Canada and I can't believe the damage that has been done to our Oil plays. Tax loss selling now and its ugly. Has to be real opportunities in the future but not yet that's for sure.
204 2018-12-13 23:36:14 Great, 
It has been predicted 
The technology is in the "baby steps",
Also the required materials to produce the technology is being mined in very ecological sensitivity areas.
We are NOT at a point in history to get rid of oil.
So build a f$%king pipeline,and use our resources
205 2018-12-13 23:36:12 Thank you.
@SecElaineChao, @kochie_online, @GOP on state & nat'l level are quietly but diligently working to sabotage our country and planet by flooding our markets with oil and our atmosphere with climate-warming gases. Greedy, short-sighted, and deadly.  #ImpeachTrumpNow
206 2018-12-13 23:36:10 I'm craving roasted yam (the type that woman on shiroro Rd used to roast that year) with  palm oil fish sauce the type I made 2 nights ago

Maybe they will give us in meeting tonight sha 
207 2018-12-13 23:35:58 Two words.

CASTOR OIL
208 2018-12-13 23:35:52 I'm lobbying for the 100x40 shop (covert man cave) with small kitchen and bathroom. Labelling it a shop and keeping things that smell like oil, grease and diesel fuel in there theoretically will limit female visitors. The garage is too close to the house #AManCanDream
209 2018-12-13 23:35:51 Josie Maran Argan Oil !!! i have super dry skin in the winter and if u do too, you’ll love it!! it’s oil based tho
210 2018-12-13 23:35:50 Do you know where they stand with their oil licence
211 2018-12-13 23:35:47 Gettin my oil chnaged and i know they smell the pack in the whip. lol
212 2018-12-13 23:35:18 Do you have any orange essential oil sis works fab with frankincense together on the bracelet x
213 2018-12-13 23:35:14 Go up here on this oil field for about 6 months and stack... ain’t shit holding me back, no kids , no girl...etc.
214 2018-12-13 23:35:12 CBD oil bottle: Contains <0.3% THC
Me, nodding: Yeah, I feel about <0.3% high
215 2018-12-13 23:35:09 upgrade him OS for am abeg!
you get oil and fuel ?
216 2018-12-13 23:35:05 Makes perfect sense that the oil industry would want rewrite the American Car Emissions Rules to lower MPG rules and thus increase gas and diesel consumption. Higher MPG cars, hybrids and total electric cars reduce oil based products’ revenues, profit and shareholders value.
217 2018-12-13 23:35:04 Even oil Sheikhs have been using that quote for a decade or more.
We certainly have found something better!
218 2018-12-13 23:34:59 Just be sure to wash that soda down with some Ranch dressing (straight from the bottle)--cuz a little cholesterol-lowering seed oil never hurts, amirite?
219 2018-12-13 23:34:53 @BiggieFunke @markscheifele55 Guys we can beat anyone..... don’t let those oil slicks intimidate u! Let’s Go! Get on them and play defensively! 
220 2018-12-13 23:34:42 And Norway  managed to hold on to it's  oil.
221 2018-12-13 23:34:35 Lingua d’oc e lingua d’oil are shaking
222 2018-12-13 23:34:31 There are 9 operating coal mines in B.C. feeding Chinese coal burning plants, one of the largest CO2 sources in the world. We can't stop China's economic growth but why not build the TMX pipeline asap and sell them oil. The change over will reduce global warming significantly.
223 2018-12-13 23:34:31 Quebec is certainly entitled to their opinion and if they don’t like the oil from the West then they really shouldn’t except the transfer payments that come from that resource.
224 2018-12-13 23:34:12 Me: (puts coconut oil on my beard as per a pharmacist's suggestion)

Me, 13 seconds later: Why does everything smell like coconut oil
225 2018-12-13 23:34:09 $50 for a vape cartridge of the real oil. Lasts a month. Better value.
226 2018-12-13 23:34:00 What about CBD OIL?
227 2018-12-13 23:33:58 Sooooo earlier today I, a skincare-obsessed (but well informed) man walked into @TheArtofShaving and noticed that their products frequently contained both:
- Oil of Bergamot () and 
- Lavender Oil () 
With no sense of irony.
228 2018-12-13 23:33:53 I'm starting not to think that CBD oil, paracetamol and decongestant were designed to be mixed. Especially not with peppermint oil too, I'm betting that one is the issue.
229 2018-12-13 23:33:35 Coconut oil
230 2018-12-13 23:33:27 “What you are - it is”

Help me out here, whose quote is this? Adolf Hitler, Mother Teresa,
David Icke? 

It’s just a wild guess- sounds like some pseudo-mystical, unqualified “Snake Oil” salesman to me.

You couldn’t make it up - oops, you just did!
231 2018-12-13 23:33:18 Nice! I have no idea what your primary job is, but if you worked in Stenungsund I would guess something with a connection to chemistry (including oil related or equipment).
232 2018-12-13 23:33:13 Like Maga Twitter, olive oil has a low burning point
233 2018-12-13 23:33:08 Yup. More and more organizations are filing lawsuits against Big Oil, and rightly so.
234 2018-12-13 23:32:56 What is his social credit score?
235 2018-12-13 23:32:49 Gee Wiz! Rudy’s in Saudi Arabia or in that region dealing w oil & making money-making deals huh?! Sure hope he don’t loose his head over oil n’ money n’ profitable notions...eh?!..Let me give that more thought; let’s see. Hmmmmm!
236 2018-12-13 23:32:46 For an oil pan?
237 2018-12-13 23:32:44 Where do you see oil going?
238 2018-12-13 23:32:30 So why do you support Republicans who are their largest supporter. Of the top 20 politicians that are lobbied by Big Oil, 2 of them are Deomcrats. More cronies in the Republican Party.... but lots in the Dems too.
239 2018-12-13 23:32:16 I don't know what you stand to gain with all these lies. What is our budget total amount this year.. 9.12trillion. And we have made 6.88trillion from non oil.. why do we need to sale some of our assets to finance the capital budget. Or maybe you don't know what u're saying. Liar
240 2018-12-13 23:32:08 I’m thinking oil painting
241 2018-12-13 23:32:06 "Dirty oil" or "bloody oil" isn't much of a choice, agreed. The choice is admittedly based on price.

I believe there could be a Cdn solution but the Fed Govt needs to help make it happen. Too bad enough of them want to keep the dirty oil in the ground & AB premier used to agree.
242 2018-12-13 23:32:00 has nothing to do with race, culture, or supporting have not provinces.
I'm totally on-board with that.

it has everything to do with Legault calling Alberta oil
 'socially unacceptable'
but suggesting that the transfer payments
 partially generated by it, are acceptable ; )
243 2018-12-13 23:31:49 Do you feel personally responsible for the Exxon Valdez oil spill? How many baby ducks would you say you sent to an early grave?
244 2018-12-13 23:31:47 made me some spin ache with eggs using coco nut oil kick slap the cheese 
245 2018-12-13 23:31:45 They all do!
246 2018-12-13 23:31:29 Ann Coulter's entire financial portfolio now and future depends on her uttering this vile, noxious drivel. It books her next interview and pre-sells her next book.

Pay no more attention to it than you would a snake oil grifter offering the cure for melancholy.
247 2018-12-13 23:31:22 And the environment!!!! Extend the ev tax credits. Make oil companies pay for what they’ve done. No more corporate welfare.
248 2018-12-13 23:31:19 Get my car back and I got some new tires , new brakes , oil change and a muhfuckin full tank of gas 
249 2018-12-13 23:31:17 Look - people do not want to hear that it takes 7 gallons of oil to produce one average car tire 
250 2018-12-13 23:31:14 Elon Musk leads the world in Snake Oil sales for 2018. The results are in. Congratulations, @elonmusk !
251 2018-12-13 23:30:47 Ah, they drill & produce oil in BC and use Alberta to transport it 
252 2018-12-13 23:30:45 But will the House Republicans? Unlikely. They love that oil money way too much.
253 2018-12-13 23:30:42 Clinton isn't to worried Mikey, she's in india attending the wedding of India's richest oil and gas guys daughter. Just like Obama approving the Dakota Access Pipeline with virtually no EPA review.
254 2018-12-13 23:30:37 My dad used to be a body builder before he injured himself so he’d ask us to take pictures of him flexing all covered in oil and shit
255 2018-12-13 23:30:33 Ask this fossil fuel supporter and climate change denier how much oil and gas stock he has.

258 2018-12-13 23:30:24 A trifecta! 9th defeat Oil City! 8th over Oil City 40-33.  7th wins 53-20. Go Hornet boys basketball!
259 2018-12-13 23:30:18 You incessantly RT known scammer and failed financial trader peter brandt who has moved into new pastures in crypto ie selling snake oil.

You are affiliated with him.

You are a cnut.
260 2018-12-13 23:30:14 Go drink motor oil
261 2018-12-13 23:30:07 Lemongrass bath kinda night.. When I'm slightly stressed soaking in a essential oil bath is THE BEST !!!!
262 2018-12-13 23:30:02 So your saying the oil tankers are being covered in human waste? Ironic.
263 2018-12-13 23:29:52 You can ease pain with things like CBD oil but nah dude, anti-inflammatories that weaken your stomach lining are fine.
264 2018-12-13 23:29:46 I'd match that and raise $1,000. 
Really do it and show me progress, and there is more where that came from. #BuildTheWallNow
#BuildTheWall
265 2018-12-13 23:29:35 I don't get what's "genius" about any of these. There are cheaper and easier options. The first one, for example; why can't you just pour the oil into the pan and swirl it around a bit? You're literally buying something and getting it dirty when you could skip that step entirely.
266 2018-12-13 23:29:18 ชอบทั้งนั้นเลย555
267 2018-12-13 23:29:07 Oil barons are focused on greed.   Greed clouds good judgement.
268 2018-12-13 23:29:06 Saudi National said they wouldn’t tolerate any bad talking about #MBS, after the vote today they threaten to cut oil. Between them and Iran threats to stop oil flow,gas and oil jobs may pick up in the #US
269 2018-12-13 23:28:47 Na engine oil I get
270 2018-12-13 23:28:42 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 7 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

279 2018-12-13 23:27:42 But you have to take British Columbia with you, @JoeBlow745.  We could be a very succeddful little country.  We would have all the oil and gas, lots of lumber, B.C. Bud and the ports.  I think we would be fine.  Let's do it!
280 2018-12-13 23:27:37 Dang. It sounds like that guy needs more than just an oil change.
281 2018-12-13 23:27:32 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
282 2018-12-13 23:27:30 in the past month i’ve gotten new wiper blades, my smog & oil checked, new tires, and i just put in a full tank of gas for the first time in a long time. i feel so accomplished.

- US provides Yemen war support
- Oil supplier / OPEC cartel member
- US military bases in Saudi Arabia

It has everything to do with the US.
287 2018-12-13 23:26:33 Thank goodness the environmental costs of Saudi oil are soo much less than Alberta's, it allows us to smugly ignore all those human rights violations.
288 2018-12-13 23:26:19 We invest a ton of money into oil companies in form of tax breaks and subsidies. Meanwhile, the execs are making millions in take home profits. Imagine if the execs took a pay cut and we moved much of that money we're investing into green energy.

294 2018-12-13 23:25:43 Oil lol it's running out I'm afraid
295 2018-12-13 23:25:40 I, personally, don't think it should be anyone's right to sell. The public lands were established for 'the public', not for oil or mining exploration. Of course, this is my opinion. #Trumpster doesn't abide by 'public' opinion! #EnvironmentDestroyer!!!
296 2018-12-13 23:25:33 Well we could start by making sure Big Money stays out of politics. What do you think Social Democrats are trying to do. They are trying to expose that very thing. Lobbyists, Big Oil, Big Pharm, and politicians. Funny how people attack them for it. But they do so...1/
297 2018-12-13 23:25:17 Oh please don't give up! Have you tried CBD Oil, people are getting amazing results from it! Great pain reliever, can Cure Cancer, Shrink Tumors, Depression, Etc, Etc! You don't get high from it either. Good luck and God Bless You!

299 2018-12-13 23:25:09 US oil is crappy oil. Can t do without that sweet arabian crude
300 2018-12-13 23:24:59 Absolutely! The United States uses Saudi Arabia as their bitch, Within the strict arrangement that the Saudis continue to price their massive oil production in US dollars. And the military industrial complex loves the billions of dollars in profits they make from Saudi purchases.
301 2018-12-13 23:24:53 I’ve used coconut oil with varying levels of success, just gotta keep the frosting cool which is basically impossible.

310 2018-12-13 23:23:38 Diffuse essential oils! There are so many out there that it’s super easy to replace candles! Personally I use the young living brand because they’re 100% pure therapeutic grade oils. All oil and no filler crap.

339 2018-12-13 23:20:10 I guess they want the price of the oil even lower that’s all.

346 2018-12-13 23:19:44 Not sure how that works with russia. He has increased sanctions, and driven down the price of oil to below russian profit levels. They lose money on every barrel right now. Not like he has been russia's friend.

368 2018-12-13 23:17:04 yeah... as do I.
Quebec keeps accepting equalization payments that Alberta pays into
(largely based on natural resources revenue)
  but won't let a pipeline pass through the province.
Because... 'environment'?

and then... buys oil from countries
with weak environmental policies.
369 2018-12-13 23:16:56 So the industrial revolution would have been possible without paper, cast iron , blast furnaces, belt drives, and oil refinement? Great empire's without moveable sails?

380 2018-12-13 23:15:49 I try to follow CDN politics as much as I do US politics, but man am I tired of listening to people from Alberta whine about oil. Do you not understand that fossil fuels are destroying the planet? Oil is not the future. It's literally our death.
381 2018-12-13 23:15:39 I don't struggle with anxiety too much, but I know those who do and they report pretty good results from CBD oil too.
382 2018-12-13 23:15:36 after considering our relationship with that oil soaked toilet I'm still leaning towards condemnation of cutting journalists into little pieces
383 2018-12-13 23:15:34 You do realize that sessions are cyclical not just in Capitalist systems and also there was a major issue with oil during that period of time
384 2018-12-13 23:15:33 Does Mr Bolton know that #Russia is still holding #Ukrainian ships that it stole in March 2014? They use Ukrainian ships they stole then to guard the Black Sea oil rigs they stole at the same time. Russia is a nation of thieves, whose greed is without bounds.

387 2018-12-13 23:14:40 1)The oil is not from SE but SS
2)Are you saying SE don't get their own shares,what did they do with it? Oh Northerners are equally managing the money for you?
3)These are SE states that have been majorly ruled by PDP govs.

396 2018-12-13 23:14:08 What if the purpose of oil in the earth is not for us to make progress and burn/combust it, but to lubricate the planet for plate tectonics? Taking it all out would make more friction and worsen earthquake severities...  #oilandgas
397 2018-12-13 23:14:07 I wouldn't say it was useless.  The keys were literally rubber-like which accumulated oil and other gunk easily.  So the protective cover actually helped keep the buttons working.
398 2018-12-13 23:14:02 I’m so over the Middle East. Let’s get the hell out of there completely. Drill our own oil and help Israel but otherwise it’s time to go.
399 2018-12-13 23:14:00 Be careful of palm oil as an ingredient in vegan produce.
400 2018-12-13 23:14:00 I think it’s called Trump Oil. 

Invented by the best president ever donchyaknow.
401 2018-12-13 23:13:36 President Trump Did It! For the First Time in 75 Years the United States Is Not Dependent on Foreign Oil. Liberals are Going Crazy.
402 2018-12-13 23:13:33 2018 Oil revenue target was N7.2Tr @ $51/bbl (N7.34Tr 2017 actual @ $45/bbl)

So N6.1Tr + N7.2Tr = N13.3Tr Bazaar, yet sectors of economy are not growing.

What is really going on? Where is our honour as the most populous black nation in the world? God help us!

Not sure that Alberta's oil is so dirty and unless all Quebecois will drive a bicycle, we need oil for transportation, to work and live...
408 2018-12-13 23:13:03 Hey Scott. An American journalist was murdered by a hostile regime where their human rights record is abysmal. The “relationship” with Saudi Arabia must be one where Americans aren’t sacrificed for oil.
409 2018-12-13 23:12:59 It used to be free when the natives used to live peacefully and before the savage settlers posing as peaceful migrants came and stabbed them in the back and stole their land.

Now its ruled by greedy corporates that has brainwashed armies of people who’re prepared to die for oil.
410 2018-12-13 23:12:56 I'am glad to hear that, but how come the U.S. continues supporting a terrorist country like Venezuela buying oil from them?? Double standard maybe???

I'm not going to argue and say 'ride your bike' or 'take a canoe', because that too misses the point.
416 2018-12-13 23:12:28 なるほどそういう設定になってんのね。がんばえ！
417 2018-12-13 23:12:16 Have fun selling fossil fuels to a dead planet. Shame on big oil.
418 2018-12-13 23:11:53 Aside from cutting oil production, your solution is?? Drum roll....
419 2018-12-13 23:11:47 Girls be complaining there cars a pos but get an oil change once a year
420 2018-12-13 23:11:42 Well Germany source most of their energy imports (coal,oil and NATGAS) from Russia and as long as Yankee & Poles still stand between Berlin and Moscow they have no worries.
421 2018-12-13 23:11:32 Palm oil is so disgusting!!! Bye @krispykreme I don't care if you're making progress on whatever. Just use something else. It's nasty!!!
422 2018-12-13 23:11:20 お詫びでーすとか言って凸ってみるか
423 2018-12-13 23:11:19 If I'm not correct about all that then ok but feel like I may have struck oil. You don't get to hurt others just because of your pain. That's very selfish. You are so unnecessarily cruel about Seth and just about everyone else. Like, who the hell are you?
424 2018-12-13 23:11:16 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ
425 2018-12-13 23:11:15 Canadian oil sells for far less.
Mostly because there are only 2 countries that buy it.

Pipelines are far more efficient, and far safer.
  than rail or tanker.

There has never been a pipeline incident as devastating as
Lac Magantic,
Atlantic Empress, or ABT Summer

441 2018-12-13 23:10:00 it depends because a lot of moisturizers have alcohol in them which many people are sensitive to. for me it causes acne so i use oil instead. lmk if you want any recommendations

447 2018-12-13 23:09:12 You know how many oil companies we have in the world. The market controls the flow of oil. 97 millions barrels per day. Forget crypto and study the oil market if you want to see decentralization at work. Game theory and attack vectors included.

452 2018-12-13 23:08:27 There is no reason for the United States to align itself with Saudi Arabia. The idea that we need them for oil is a myth as most of our oil is produced domestically. The largest foreign exporter of oil to the US by far is Canada. Then Mexico and Venezuela and then Saudi Arabia.

466 2018-12-13 23:06:34 You are assuming that light crude processing can continue indefinitely. It can’t. Refineries are not designed to do it. You also have to remember a lot of that export is to a limited number of refineries and many of those refineries belong to shale oil producers.
467 2018-12-13 23:06:29 Considering voters coming of age now were 8 yrs old when Obama elected.

491 2018-12-13 23:04:31 Good evening.  We source 100% of palm oil from suppliers who are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. We are also a relatively modest user of palm oil and substitute it with alternatives where appropriate.
492 2018-12-13 23:04:28 Venezuela, by some measures home to the world’s largest crude reserves, saw oil output drop in September to a four-decade low of 1.17 million barrels.

why wouldn't they buy it from Canada?

Especially if we’re one of a few countries not in the Paris Accord.
508 2018-12-13 23:03:31 You should be asking this question about pipelines, Andy. At least locally refined oil products could be sold domestically in Western Canada. It would sure as heck be easier to buy locally refined fuel than to try to figure out how to boycott stuff from Quebec!

528 2018-12-13 23:01:12 USA have the right to do so, and we have the right to stop our endless support to USA which include selling oil with different currency (dollars).

For me, I still believe that USA is not a stupid country to be controlled and guided by CNN, Iran, Al-Jazira, Obama.

543 2018-12-13 22:59:57 Let me get this straight, a QC sector simply can’t understand why a CDN business would support a foreign supplied product over one available in Canada? This is the same argument that Alberta is using because QC is importing foreign oil rather than buying CDN oil. Hypocrites

552 2018-12-13 22:59:07 CBD oil tastes like straight up grass.
553 2018-12-13 22:59:04 Making penne and mushrooms in a light sun-dried tomato and olive oil + garlic sauce tonight! Shaved parmesan cheese and parsley atop, with plenty of pepper! :D

555 2018-12-13 22:58:42 Or, to use a Chanukah metaphor: the oil that keeps on burning.
556 2018-12-13 22:58:34 I feel Dallas is a better team and a manning winning in Lucas Oil just feels right.
557 2018-12-13 22:58:28 You just get to party? The ONLY reason he didnt is bcse it polled about as low as Congress approval. Ocare polled poorly itself, but as history shows, ramming something through insures it never goes away, apathy sets in, just accept that's just the way it is

563 2018-12-13 22:58:15 No money or oil in it, but I’d love to see our military used to help relocate these children with their families.
564 2018-12-13 22:58:07 Do you use (or have used in the past) CBD oil for anything? If so, what has your experience been with it?

567 2018-12-13 22:57:44 I need to learn how to change my own oil so I can stop taking time out my day to do this. The last time I was at the shop for 2 hours for a simple oil change

572 2018-12-13 22:57:13 We are weening off of their oil thanks to @realDonaldTrump. But we are not there yet. And if you think globalism is a “conspiracy theory”, then you’re ignorant AF & need to watch the news now and then.

576 2018-12-13 22:56:47 You think that bitcoin could be a benchmark\underpinning for world trade i.e. oil instead of the dollar one day? From a currency convergence standpoint, it makes perfect sense IMO.

584 2018-12-13 22:56:00 3/3 (maybe 4)   O'care still has her screwed.  
 Sounds crazy, but I knew 9/11 was a Govt job. Wars means more money for those invested in oil!  Go Bush's. (including his daddy). 
Clinton, allowed our service women and men to be killed and did nothing.
585 2018-12-13 22:55:58 Man I just got an oil change this car gomn
586 2018-12-13 22:55:44 I got an essential oil plug in and my room smells like angels n cheesecake idk
587 2018-12-13 22:55:37 So feeling a little freaked out, there's Yellow Vest protest planned across Canada, most say against Un migration pact, against UN, they are pro oil, pipelines, they have photos against the Pm and there's even an event planned for the summer with rhetoric on Nationalism.
588 2018-12-13 22:55:29 hot grease or a good oil in the pan, pat them on both sides with flour, salt and pepper, cook fast, rare to med-rare. I mean, warm through, crisp on the edges. lol
589 2018-12-13 22:55:03 Drizzle olive oil and lemon juice
590 2018-12-13 22:54:56 Lol u clearly don’t follow many oil field groups or anything right leaning on social media if u think the left are about “name calling & insults”. The “left” often do, yes, but they do it as a response to an attack, the “right” attack as a response to an option they don’t like.
591 2018-12-13 22:54:49 ガチャ発表まだな気がするから期待しないでおこう
592 2018-12-13 22:54:33 Gas prices have gone down everywhere, because the price of oil has gone down, from about $73 about 3 months ago, to today's stock market closing about $52.50
593 2018-12-13 22:54:20 I useto have really bad acne when I was younger and everyone would recommend coconut oil and I always felt it would make my skin worse. I so recommend not listening to people cause we have a different skin type just go to a good dermatologist
594 2018-12-13 22:54:03 Does anyone know how or know someone that knows how to clean the inside of the side pocket of my MK purse?! I had a small bottle of hair oil in there and it spilled all over 
595 2018-12-13 22:54:01 It’s Us! 
But HISD is held back by a state school funding scheme that is going to lose TX many more industries. 
And we need to refocus as “Energy Capital.” That title cannot just mean extraction & refining. Ask New England towns who used to hold that crown processing Whale oil.
596 2018-12-13 22:53:57 sorry but if your skincare routine includes putting coconut oil on your face, do not offer me any skincare advice

602 2018-12-13 22:52:58 Got my car back 4 hours after dropping it off for an oil change at @NTB with my digital speedometer disabled. They offered me $20 off my $75 oil change. Won’t be going back again. 
603 2018-12-13 22:52:40 Templars created the hospital. Cannabis smoke and hashish was used in the Holy of Holies Alter in the Temple to send prayers to God. Templates were devout. Christ means Anointed. Anointing oil is made from cannabis 2+2=4

605 2018-12-13 22:52:33 Ain’t oil my scalp in 3 days it’s flaking down because it’s dry
606 2018-12-13 22:52:32 While I support the energy industry and encourage getting oil to tide water by any means necessary it makes one wonder how bad things really are when you see what the used iron brought at ritchies in Edmonton yesterday.  Some strong prices on tri drive winch trucks IMO
607 2018-12-13 22:52:16 It's not oil... It's arms. These guys buy stockpiles of weapons and planes etc from our companies. Billions annually... It's not oil.

610 2018-12-13 22:52:10 Then you would know the difference between WTI/Brent Blend and Western Canadian Select heavy oil/ non- and upgraded bitumen.

Canadian refineries can't handle it. it is volatile and more toxic than other grades.

Dirty.

611 2018-12-13 22:52:04 I’ve had the sticky paint thing only once. And it was on the newel post bollard thing years ago. I believe it’s common as there’s tonnes of hand skin grease deposits and can interfere with the paint. Particularly oil. Def didn’t degrease properly back then.
612 2018-12-13 22:52:04 no - HH1 sees 7-11m barrels of the oil in place.  Same amount of oil is still in place.
613 2018-12-13 22:51:58 "Officials report oil running down the street and into a creek."
614 2018-12-13 22:51:56  supports candidacy of neolib chump centrist in bed with oil industry instead of actually addressing the failed policies that led to the rise of fascism in her southern neighbor presently led by a reality show doofus... because the candidate is hot.
615 2018-12-13 22:51:53 Kung nakatira ka sa Metro Manila, kadiri. Andami pa ring duming nakadikit sa mukha mo na hindi nalilinis ng facial foam or soap.

Think of it this way: remember sticker tattoos? Di ba baby oil ang pantanggal kasi ayaw matanggal sa sabon at tubig? Ganun din yung ibang dumi.
616 2018-12-13 22:51:37 what’s up who needs minor car repairs (oil changes/fluids checked or added/ flushes) i’m just lookin for experience n i got the car bug
617 2018-12-13 22:51:34 Your episode on Oil has strongly validated our decision for 2019 to prioritize the elimination, wherever possible, and reduction where it's currently not feasible to eliminate entirely, our dependence on fossil fuels. We can't wait for govt to do the right thing, especially now.
618 2018-12-13 22:51:33 It’s not that there should be any shame associated with powdered creamer (who cares?). It’s the stuff is supposed to be deadly for you healthwise! I think I read it’s made of palm seed oil or something as bad. Cow milk (cream, while still fat, is better for you)!
619 2018-12-13 22:51:31 My baby almost one lol but mine not that bad I’m just dramatic try bio oil someone just told me that !
620 2018-12-13 22:51:29 I forget … did Twitter ban Joss Whedon when he said, "I want a rhino to fuck @SpeakerRyan to death with its horn”?

622 2018-12-13 22:51:23 Ottavis va a juicio oral, adivina si es por la pelea solitaria de la ex mujer o por el colectivo sin gas oil de las feminazis.
623 2018-12-13 22:51:20 As I said in the previous reply, the point of which you completely ignored, is that regardless of who rules Syria, the loss of agricultural land, oil wells, and Euphrates dams harms the entire Syrian populace. A mortal wound that would harm Syrians for centuries long after Assad.
624 2018-12-13 22:50:59 Legault calling Alberta oil "dirty" he prefers saudi oil with blood money or Algerian corruption oil, just can't understand his arrogance
625 2018-12-13 22:50:56 The russians only flew to Venezuela to fill in the An-124 cargo full of GOLD because communist Maduro broke PDVSA and it's no producing oil
626 2018-12-13 22:50:52 They don’t like us because of the Oil money  It’s as simple as that.

628 2018-12-13 22:50:23 It’s the only material that the navy would use for the rope to tie down battleships! I use the extract daily with peppermint oil infused for anti inflammatory issues with my stomach! This mixture instantly soothes a sore throat. It relieves my tension and lets my sinuses drain!
629 2018-12-13 22:50:20 @MSignorile reminder, what was in it for Russia? The sanctions after Ukraine killed a half trillion dollar oil deal between Russia and Exxon
630 2018-12-13 22:50:18 The vapes and oils are both super effective though, and they taste amazing.  I have chronic illnesses that cause a lot of severe pain, and I take the oil daily. I personally have not tried the vapes, but I've only heard good things about them.
631 2018-12-13 22:50:01 It’s a dipstick for checking the oil level in your car!

And see? Not every man is going to know things about cars, and believe it or not some women do! Crazy. I hate getting put in boxes like that.
632 2018-12-13 22:49:55 A dictator would have thrown them in jail, say, Harper. A Harper or Scheer or Kenney would have stood up for the rights of the corporation. Nevermind that those companies are now replacing oil workers w robots & driverless trucks. Go Trudeau!
633 2018-12-13 22:49:54 going vegan is first & most important step. than switch to solar energy. then reducing population. then ditching plastic & palm oil & all other oils.
634 2018-12-13 22:49:52 Went in to get my oil changed and left with a loaner car because they said my car was too dangerous to drive until they replace parts in it. I’m either really hard on the cars I drive or I just have bad luck 
635 2018-12-13 22:49:50 Trolls and naysayers denouncing the imperfect, but valid attempt. 
My veiw generally is many ppl not really lazy, just less motivated. Various reasons they will not move where jobs are. Leading a horse to water......, we will see if they will drink.

639 2018-12-13 22:49:39 USSR literally traded oil & iron with them to fund the nazis invasion of France. 

Everybody traded with the nazis. USSR was no different
640 2018-12-13 22:49:35 Bankers pretty much write their own rules. Oil companies write their own regulations. I do believe a court should be used to enforce property rights (if day the oil company pollutes land owned by someone else, they should pay) I also think banks have too much say.
641 2018-12-13 22:49:25 What a ridiculous way of measuring this. Holy lord. This doesn't even touch the subsidies we see for oil when it comes to cars.
642 2018-12-13 22:49:22 Not edible olives I'm afraid, these are black olives used for making olive oil..
643 2018-12-13 22:49:19 Urgent need to decarbonize - wane off the oil - go electric -and super fast!
644 2018-12-13 22:49:13 the epitome of how my life is going is taking my car to get the oil changed and finding out some line is about to snap and i’m not gonna make it 2 miles lol

648 2018-12-13 22:49:00 @BarackObama nothing to be proud of pushing up oil production the worlds dying and choking and in CLIMATE CRISIS - that’s your daughters futures that look bleak too - still proud?
649 2018-12-13 22:48:27 For one thing toots, we need oil. Even without the need for gas guzzling vehicles, we need oil.

Achieveing 'economic' justice' would take place without taxes, outside of Sales Tax, being imposed on Americans.
650 2018-12-13 22:48:18 Your Party has turned on you. They wanted to lose the House so they could have a partner in crime. They didn't even contest 34 seats. They've ruined relations with Russia, China, Saudi Arabia. Results? Ukraine ships, 3 Chinese hostages, Arabs going to cut oil to raise prices.
651 2018-12-13 22:48:18 Check your facts. Your right about the pipeline being a short term construction process but the ability to transport crude oil to higher paying markets allows for Canadian companies to expand and hire more employees to contribute to our Canadian economy for years to come.
652 2018-12-13 22:48:16 Oil & gas folks tend to use @fenicsproject quite frequently.
653 2018-12-13 22:48:13 Hey @franco_nomics and @ScottHennig. I asked you a couple days ago what the CTF thinks about the oil production cuts in Alberta. Do you think #ableg should step in and mandate production cuts or not? Pretty simple question.
654 2018-12-13 22:48:08 You’ll need a bit more than this. 
I gave an article with research identifying how Beto got his oil money, and how it broke one of his pledges. Find the same for Sanders and I’m all ears. 

Also good to see you have no defence of Beto
655 2018-12-13 22:48:07 Stop investing in fracking, pipe lines for oil,. Keep our beaches clean and use the engery ur so called "god" gave us . Ocean,  wind , SUN!!!!!!!
656 2018-12-13 22:47:57 I had to get an oil change, our school has a bomb threat (nationwide??!) and now I have a flat tire. I had to call of work and I’m broke.. 

How’s your day going?
657 2018-12-13 22:47:32 Cook in a pan with olive oil and plenty of garlic and sea salt. Better than a future second rounder.
658 2018-12-13 22:47:27 I'll dispute 'most'. A bit more than half of BC residents support the TMX twinning (I'm one of them) if polls are to be believed. The incessant complaints coming out of Alberta, despite efforts to support the oil and gas sector, isn't helping.
659 2018-12-13 22:47:22 Drove home with the windows open, blasting music, chewing gum and diffusing peppermint oil just to stay awake.
660 2018-12-13 22:47:07 Went to school, cleaned my car inside out, FINALLY went for an oil change, cleaned my room, my house, finna exfoliate my whole ass body, do a face mask, and take a bath. Bitch today is a good day
661 2018-12-13 22:47:01 How would you find innovations to drive a $1.3 Billion revenue goal for the economy? See how Imaginatik and the Oil and Gas Technology Centre did it in our poster at the World Open Innovation Conference. #WOIC2018 #OpenInnovation @theogtc

667 2018-12-13 22:46:29 Look, let's just say that if there's hot oil, I want as much of my skin covered as I can possibly arrange.
668 2018-12-13 22:46:22 Also, you are leaving out all of the energy that it took to get oil out of the ground, transport it to a refinery, refine it, transport it to the the pumps, then pump it into your car. So, a substantial amount of energy is consumed before you "burn it at the point of use".
669 2018-12-13 22:46:21 十字キー灰色の部分を軸に折り畳めそうですねw
670 2018-12-13 22:46:20 True but the govt allows.  Maybe tax imported oil.
671 2018-12-13 22:46:17 And Trump is repaying Putin by increasing US energy production and pressing OPEC to lower oil prices?
672 2018-12-13 22:46:17 Both countries benefit from a high oil price. Currently both are in the $hit with oil at the current level. Saudis need $85 a barrel to balance their books and pay the generous allowances to the unemployed and less fortunate.
673 2018-12-13 22:46:09 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
674 2018-12-13 22:45:53 It is no wonder weekly standard, national review are dying, attack trump, Hubris bs, never mind all the great Supreme court and judges , cutting regulation, oil production up, ISIS actually being wiped out, yet you would advocate HRC winning, what the F is wrong with you, just go

684 2018-12-13 22:45:03 How 'bout Trudeau? Doonesbury still pretty relevant, sadly. One of his earliest, still Viet Nam-era strips had the boys filling out cards at the post office answering the question of being will to die for the interests of oil companies. It used to be parody.
685 2018-12-13 22:44:19 My truck need an oil change in the morning. I need a whole wife to get that done while I rest.
686 2018-12-13 22:44:10 Oil rigs after new years
687 2018-12-13 22:43:58 Look at people like Harvey Weinstein that literally ruined women’s careers for not sleeping with him. I worked in oil and gas. Same thing.
688 2018-12-13 22:43:48 Ottawa should've been buying electric car plant. Public health=huge concern in inner city. Never mind talk about Christmas ornaments!
Politicians who talk out of both sides of mouth+serve selves and rich are a waste of taxes. I'll have nothing to do with events sponsored by oil.X
689 2018-12-13 22:43:38 if anybody wants to buy me a gift I really want some nice decorative oil and vinegar bottles. 
690 2018-12-13 22:43:34 
691 2018-12-13 22:43:14 Y’all out here getting with niggas that can’t even change a tire or do an oil change... como putassss.. no pos wow
692 2018-12-13 22:43:11 Tectonic plate movement had nothing to do with climate change or oil/natural gas harvesting, albeit there are mini tremors that are caused by fracking but those are very localized and wouldnt span the distance that this earthquake did.
693 2018-12-13 22:42:49 You obviously have not gone to a car dealership to get your oil changed. This morning took 3 hours. 
694 2018-12-13 22:42:48 Do you know how weird it is as a kid from the Middle East to live in a country that doesn't value it's oil 
695 2018-12-13 22:42:41 Update on my life: I attempted to add oil into my car.  It was really cold all of a sudden and windy and I’m in shorts (long story).  My hand was shaking and the cap fell somewhere in the engine I can’t reach or see.  Now I’m stuck here trying to figure out what to fucking do....
696 2018-12-13 22:42:33 That's class. I add olive oil to everything except ice cream
697 2018-12-13 22:42:21 OGC Consulting aims for a balanced approach to both operator and non-operator concerns. The company conducts compliance reviews, overhead recovery, revenue compliance reviews and other reviews for the oil and gas industry. #oil #gas #consulting #solutions
698 2018-12-13 22:42:16 Scott how did that work out for the Jews under Hitler's reign of terror over Germany?  One notable death hides how many others?  
Scott why is the US pumping out oil but the Prez give the Saudi's credit for lower oil prices ??? could it be Trump lies.
699 2018-12-13 22:41:53 Yes. You need to post margin in USD because (generally speaking) USD is stable and people want it more than oil. Things are a lot less predictable when both legs are unstable
700 2018-12-13 22:41:52 My hair was so nappy omg this hot comb and hot oil treatment did wonders!
701 2018-12-13 22:41:38 Putin gets a new base in the US's backyard (ala Cuban situation) and all the oil and gold. Only paid $6B to peacefully "invade". Genius.
702 2018-12-13 22:41:31 The writing is on the wall for #oil #investments. Look at how coal plants are being closed far faster than planned - this week 2 US utilities backtracked on coal and pledge 100% renewable. When battery cars gain price/range parity in 2020+ you'll have #StrandedAssets
703 2018-12-13 22:41:31 Another thing that shows Trump cares about “average voters”;  his efforts in making the US energy independent. 

I’ve never liked being beholden to countries who have called for our and Israel’s destruction just because we buy oil from them.
704 2018-12-13 22:41:29 Putting a shit ton $$$ on an Oil loss... Just not sure what game to Parlay with.
705 2018-12-13 22:41:26 22 countries have no oil.
706 2018-12-13 22:41:23 I usually don’t change mine till I feel the oil isn’t been wiped off properly.
707 2018-12-13 22:41:18 Fiero-heads claim it's easy if you heat the gear up in oil, and then it'll slam right on the cam stub. I don't see why induction heat wouldn't be more effective. Heat the gear, then slam it right on. Hmmm....
708 2018-12-13 22:40:59 るちおはよー！
709 2018-12-13 22:40:55 The new oil and gas extraction technologies are certainly a true game changer for the United States, and also for the world indirectly. For another 25 years electric cars won't be affordable for the masses, but the new oil and gas gives the US enough time.

711 2018-12-13 22:40:38 So? In case anyone here doesn't know how to do a pan fry I'm including the instructions:

1. Thaw whatever you're cooking
2. Get a deep af skillet with lid
3. Add a small drop of oil to skillet
3.5. Low heat
4. Add thing you're frying AWAY from oil
5. Lid on
6. Shimmy the pan
712 2018-12-13 22:40:31 Not oil, not cleaning patches.  Just parts that could be used as part of a gun build.  Obvious parts like barrrels, trigger components, magazines, are a no-brainer.  I also include screws and springs because it's just simpler to include them than exclude, and there's no downside.
713 2018-12-13 22:40:15 I have been doing some work with individual names in the Oil Services Sector. Holy Toledo... There is some major silliness going on in this sector.

You may hear some crowing about it raising $1.5 million. Don't be fooled! It was a pretty terrible lease sale for taxpayers...1/5

720 2018-12-13 22:39:35 It's not like we even need them for oil anymore.
721 2018-12-13 22:39:25 For unnatural colors like green n shit, you can use cheap dandruff shampoo with vitamin c powder mixed in, let it sit for a bit and it should take some color out, if not all (: apparently coconut oil is good for damaged hair too if it’s damaged

726 2018-12-13 22:39:10 That probably has to do with different grades of crude oil and what refineries are equipped to refine which oil.

732 2018-12-13 22:38:01 yes for baked. those are the essentials. rosemary, thyme, olive oil, lemon pepper, kosher sea salt, garlic powder and a dash of red pepper. 

for fried, i do a little turmeric, sea salt, black pepper, red pepper and garlic powder.
733 2018-12-13 22:37:59 Just referencing oceanic oil disasters generally, not claiming drilling off West Coast specifically. They are environmental disasters when they do happen.

737 2018-12-13 22:37:38 More treasonous acts against oil. Tired of this. What does the ski lifts and grooming machines run on whistler water. Oh wait what about the thousands of cars that. One to the hill that run on that sweet water.

740 2018-12-13 22:37:19 A carbon tax is a flea to the oil industry and changes nothing if you  give it back to consumers, who will need to use it to fill up with the  exact same gas as before so they can get to work. No CO2 cut. from comments
741 2018-12-13 22:37:16 The oil weights more for the #US than anything else.
742 2018-12-13 22:36:59 Used Crankcase oil, now that brings back memories.
743 2018-12-13 22:36:54 I just dread oil these days if it’s wrong it’s realllly wrong and can’t be fixed for like 8 to 16 hours. But when I do use oil I remember how nice it is how it flows

754 2018-12-13 22:35:50 Socialism cannot be collapsed by oil prices being increased. Even a socialism that needs to interact in the global market wouldnt be

Instead the Soviet government stockpiled oil and banned it from being used in many applications. Doesnt sound like socialism to me

756 2018-12-13 22:35:34 I have been avoiding purchasing products with palm oil. Continue this policy? Or don't worry about it for now? Or something else?

James Dean was busy being born every moment.
773 2018-12-13 22:33:02 Okay, so we re not going to talk about the mottor oil?
774 2018-12-13 22:32:44 I'm going to go with a solid "no opinion" on this one (although I'd surmise Alberta is somewhere between u two's goal posts).

That said, Alberta has loads more than 20 years oil. The question is whether the US will still want it if pipes don't get built soon.
775 2018-12-13 22:32:43 Well because OPEC flooded the global oil reserves and forced the price of oil to tank and oil execs decided to lay off people in their droves....had to make sure they kept their salaries and bonuses....this also all happened during the conservative leadership.
776 2018-12-13 22:32:38 @grassosteve Steve, remember what you said about oil? “It will never go over $50 again.”
Stop using ‘never’, it will make you look bad every time. Today, you used the word about the banks. Learn fro Tim, Karen...
777 2018-12-13 22:32:27 put oil in the beard, now I’m prospering
778 2018-12-13 22:32:22 Long oil, short stocks only way to go
779 2018-12-13 22:31:54 Coconut oil foreverrrrr
780 2018-12-13 22:31:40 ...maybe - I'd also get some coconut oil and avocado etc. in there, and plenty fish rather than just the oil

782 2018-12-13 22:31:34 Tell me why I get it worse. 

One time she offered to make me fried chicken and you know what she did?

She put oil on the chicken and “cooked” it in the microwave 
783 2018-12-13 22:31:31 Ok I love Instagram giveaways as much as the next person, but I draw the line when I have to follow 15 accounts just to enter. I understand the reason, but I have enough oil and Instant Pot recipes on my timeline already.

787 2018-12-13 22:31:08 Hate when I’m getting a OIL CHANGE and the mfs wanna tell me some other shit! Look I came here for 1 thing
788 2018-12-13 22:30:52 You round data because it is an estimate. Highly inaccurate since it’s based off just a few fixed collisions.

An estimate you of course admit. 

Is it “big oil” that makes nhtsa disavow ranking based on the first decimal place?
789 2018-12-13 22:30:52 Embarrassing.
790 2018-12-13 22:30:47 A socialist economy doesn't get toppled by artificial tampering with oil prices

And that's literally what toppled the USSR's economy.

A tactic the US has since used on every country with even a partially capitalist system they want to topple

Because it's a capitalist exploit

796 2018-12-13 22:30:19 I’m an oil producer selling a forward in oil for USD. I need to post margin in USD. The reason the derivatives market exists is because I want to run my oil business and the entire derivatives space is just a parallel process only involving USD.
797 2018-12-13 22:30:19 Now there’s no reason to sell them weapons right? @realDonaldTrump WTI is better oil and it’s right here. —Let the dollar collapse and start over.
798 2018-12-13 22:30:12 @MelissaLeeCNBC Steve uses the word ‘never’ often which makes him look bad. Remember when he said oil would never go over $50? Today he used the word again about the banks.
799 2018-12-13 22:29:55 You have a proposal to not allow anyone that has taken oil money to sit on the energy committee, and anyone with donations that are a conflict of interest. Do you have a name for that proposal? Because I NEED to call all my reps and tell them to support it.
800 2018-12-13 22:29:50 Just feel sorry for anyone who actually pays for this expecting results ....snake oil salesman ...targeting vulnerable people with false hope ...
801 2018-12-13 22:29:48 Surprisingly? They damn well better considering how many people they ripped off at launch by selling snake oil and lies.
802 2018-12-13 22:29:43 The oil  is great for anxiety but the topical cream is better for aches and pains : )
803 2018-12-13 22:29:36 I just gummed some of my dog’s CBD oil
804 2018-12-13 22:29:26 Saw a man in Waterloo once wearing brown shoes with a grey suit. Frightful oil
805 2018-12-13 22:29:24 Which essential oil is gonna help me through finals?
806 2018-12-13 22:28:35 Look at auto makers. Oil companies. They are decentralized when you look st it globally. They’ve made a fortune too.
807 2018-12-13 22:28:34 also maybe he was shocked you knew you needed to get your oil changed or smth? ive seen posts online w/ people being like 'uhhhh what do i do' when car troubles happen
808 2018-12-13 22:28:30 Recording to stormy to have sex with Donny it is more or less like lesbian sex but with less fun.....with or without oil.....he is always a little fatty ....
809 2018-12-13 22:27:55 Oil is rallying because it is massively oversold. Stocks are definitely not oversold
810 2018-12-13 22:27:54 それほど下半身が多忙なのかーーーーーーーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
811 2018-12-13 22:27:53 There's my ignorance I thought they could grow it and get the oil out of it.but I think if it helps people what's the problem or is it pressure from drug companies not being able to cash in on more expensive drugs
812 2018-12-13 22:27:45 Price targets are based on projected EV demand and Tesla supply to much of that demand. The more other EV oems the better for all (except oil and tslaq)
813 2018-12-13 22:27:45 It’s empty, but it’s also a business model for schmancy snake oil salesmen hawking expensive diversions from what cities really need.
814 2018-12-13 22:27:42 Oil
815 2018-12-13 22:27:41 LOVE that our Frankincense is almost HALF the price of other oil companies.
816 2018-12-13 22:27:40 which essential oil makes you stop being a dumb bitch?
817 2018-12-13 22:27:40 食パンさん、おはようございます
818 2018-12-13 22:27:37 I wish to amend this tweet to level disappointment at Dems & Repubs blocking or voting against steps to require withdrawal for support of Saudi's war in Yemen. I think sanctions should be imposed on Saudi Arabia, and the US needs to redouble efforts to quit its dependence on oil.
819 2018-12-13 22:27:28 Lolz it makes no difference 
820 2018-12-13 22:27:18 yeah it wasn’t leaking any oil luckily and I never use the convertible top so I’m not all that bothered by it and yes I noticed the seams are kind of worn and coming apart a bit and I’m fine with the shitty gas mileage my other car was no better

822 2018-12-13 22:27:07 An AR-15 is great but I'll use my 12 gage, shorter range for safety.
823 2018-12-13 22:27:06 But I’ve been waiting over an hour for my oil change
824 2018-12-13 22:27:06 Well that is true but it's b/c the the US & the West don't care. See in #Cameroon e.g where the dictator #PaulBiya  is slaughtering the anglophones minority. #uk is there to sign oil deals while the EU turns a deaf ear. The US has started acting tough thank you & Continue.
825 2018-12-13 22:27:05 today i took my car in to get the oil changed and the guy handling everything (who was realy nice and chill) saw my birthday and was like “wow…..you’re so young” and i was like thanks my bones creak when i get out of my bed some mornings
826 2018-12-13 22:27:02 Macgillycuddy should reference the precedent set by Quebec's potential separation in 1995. If Alberta separated the control over oil and other resource assets would remain with Alberta. FN treaties would be a message to transfer and/or renegotiate.

828 2018-12-13 22:26:34 Obama tried to put us on the path to fossil fuel independence.  He tried.   Trump took us right back into the greedy hands of his buddies, the oil syndicate, and here we are!  Serves us right.  I only hope it affects 3 poor Trumpers for every American at the pump!
829 2018-12-13 22:26:33 Bread with oil> bread with butter
830 2018-12-13 22:26:32 Refinery capacity across Canada is almost nil I would support a pipeline if they address the issues and bought in Proper Oversight, I'm a realist we need oil and will long into the future but can't continue to put industry first You might be surprised to know I worked in this 1/2
831 2018-12-13 22:26:31 In nonrelated news,Im looking forward to seeing overdue oil replacement with @Valvoline and @SeaFoamSales crankcase+fuel #cleaner..was recommended to only use half n half for each #petroleum pump @AdvanceAuto but might wait til weekend before attempting for first time regardless.
832 2018-12-13 22:26:24 People who return books with front page missing/back page missing/oil stained pages for no solid reason should be arrested

834 2018-12-13 22:26:01 I don't mind fire, & it's not like I haven't spilled hot oil all over myself before, but I really don't like the noise of the pan scraping across the top of the hob.

Millions of acres will be destroyed + pollute air & water, destroy habitat for endangered wildlife. This destruction is FOREVER, versus a small amoun of oil or gas extracted for a few months use!
840 2018-12-13 22:25:33 The world market has caused a downturn?? Why is any Canadian province getting oil from an Arabic nation over your own provincial allies?? That’s a better question.

847 2018-12-13 22:24:44 Because the price of oil is based on the market and that is wrong but that's how it is.

852 2018-12-13 22:23:59 Maybe Fraser has been asked this a thousand times but unfortunately ive missed his answer.  What is his view on (at least what Oil fans believe) the repeated missed interference calls against McDavid?

857 2018-12-13 22:23:25 When you feel proud India went against America to tie up with Iran for oil import, then, it's not because of farmer but coz of tht travelling n ad. Indeed, they may have done something for farmer too.
Can you tell on what background, you accused BJP being against Education?

859 2018-12-13 22:23:23 I was in an art supplies shop today, I neared a man & woman looking at oil paints “....am I just being silly? It’s silly right!?” She says. He rubs her shoulder & says “no, not at all, you’ve always wanted to try it” - it’s NEVER silly to try something new, you might love it! 
860 2018-12-13 22:23:11 I wondering if John Kelly is leaving because he may have unknowingly committed dirty deeds without  for Donald Trump? Anything is possible in that circus of snake oil sellers.

878 2018-12-13 22:20:58 @Ocasio2018 legit question. How hard is it for companies who make money on oil to research, study and convert to renewable energy? You would think since money is their goal they would invest in this. Would create way more jobs and help our planet. Is there something I’m missing?
879 2018-12-13 22:20:54 You both do realize that we don’t need oil from the Kingdom.  They are increasingly a small player.  Do take you conspiracy theories and go back to hiding under the bed.

881 2018-12-13 22:20:44 Crossroads gives IU 25% of tickets = 5000 tickets. Not good.  Play a stand alone game or move this to Lucas Oil.
882 2018-12-13 22:20:43 Oh the sweet irony of Saudi Arabia getting our corrupt government in trouble because they owe us money for oil...
883 2018-12-13 22:20:37 Do they own hotels the Saudi are booking rooms at? Or do they  own some oil refineries
884 2018-12-13 22:20:18 Have you had your vehicle looked over for the up coming holiday travels? Brakes, oil change, coolant level, tires just to name a few. Call or stop by to set up an appointment to make sure your travels don't turn into a headache this holiday!
885 2018-12-13 22:20:06 they're trying to drain the earth of her oil so she doesn't start up, like a car. they're trying to burn it all off and profit from it as well and we are all playing along in this game, letting these excessive companies exist.

888 2018-12-13 22:19:34 Predicted this several days ago when Kelly got booted. It’s a corrupt family business—who else can Trump trust to keep the olive oil and waste management cover going? Can only be Jared or Ivanka.
889 2018-12-13 22:19:31 Exactly! Better public transport is objectively good for all involved, except the oil tycoons/car manufacturers/etc.—i.e., the people with money and power. So they’ve viciously, systematically helped maintain this culture of cars being a daily necessity for the “American Dream”.
890 2018-12-13 22:19:31 Alberta makes money on oil... Alberta pays billions in transfer payments from oil money, Quebec gets transfer payments from Alberta’s oil money, Quebec pays for 1/3 of its government services with transfer payments that it gets from Alberta oil money (among other sources)
891 2018-12-13 22:19:26 With a little dirty oil money it’s easy to start a popular movement using social media. Profit driven social media is a threat to democracy.
892 2018-12-13 22:19:21 Grilled with olive oil and salt/pepper until soft is a proven winner. I too used to hate when my Mom served them. Turns out, Mom just didn’t know how to cook them
893 2018-12-13 22:19:18 Have you been to Oklahoma?  If the people there wake up their wind could power the entire country & they wouldn't have to frack for oil or gas.

@realDonaldTrump @charliekirk11 @marklevinshow @mitchellvii 
Then tell me, is it just about the temperature going up three degrees over the next hundred years? Because of oil & coal?

907 2018-12-13 22:17:57 Right, when oil was selling for $75 up per barrel & spread b/t WTI and WCS wasn’t so significant, it might’ve been an acceptable formula. Quebec has no legs to stand on trying to deny pipeline construction, if so then opt out of Alberta Oil funded equalization, absolute LUNACY
908 2018-12-13 22:17:56 The answer is: oil money!!!!
909 2018-12-13 22:17:46 Considering when oil is making money
The feds see a large piece of pie
That would make sense
It’s like playing the stock market
910 2018-12-13 22:16:55 I realize you probably wanted to try to get some different ideas in, but putting a snake oil salesman pushing pseudo-scientific BS on your show was a bad idea

912 2018-12-13 22:16:49 There actually were workers councils in Iran and a big oil workers strike but a lot of folk seemed to overlook them being put down viciously soon after.
913 2018-12-13 22:16:45 I think Alberta’s profits from oil money went to quebec
914 2018-12-13 22:16:43 How would you suggest then that the oil be transported if not by pipeline?  Tankers make me very nervous especially going true the mountains. I didn’t think you refined much oil o. BC

923 2018-12-13 22:16:05 Hey Ronnie,
How much does the federal government collect in taxes off that gallon of fuel?
55 cents at the pump is a combined federal and state tax road tax. It doesn't reflect the tax the federal government collects from the oil companies at the well head, the cost of permitting
924 2018-12-13 22:16:03 Africa has a lot of valuable metals and oil.

930 2018-12-13 22:15:03 The only thing that can explain what @JustinTrudeau has done to derail our industry is that he is getting a piece of the billions of dollars the American refineries are making from our discounted oil.

932 2018-12-13 22:14:58 Except much much larger. With bigger subsidies and tax breaks that are on going. The aerospace and auto industry would kill to get the same treatment our oil companies get without even asking.

939 2018-12-13 22:14:10 "Unless it is diluted, eucalyptus oil is highly concentrated and dangerous, even in small doses. A 3.5-milliliter dose of undiluted eucalyptus oil can be fatal, according to MedlinePlus" and you trust a stoner with measuring that shit?

945 2018-12-13 22:13:45 Really?  There are actually working class people who live there. As far as peasants working in the oil and gas industry, never met one. Have met a lot of rich Albertans who own property in Whistler though. Stupid comment.
946 2018-12-13 22:13:40 I have often wondered why they have such a fasination with Georgia. But it has a low indictment count now the red areas make sense they are heavy oil field and industrial areas. As well as border states
947 2018-12-13 22:13:39 That's very nice of you, I really applaud you for that....

You might also learn to clean the gen plugs and gauge the oil too. Might come in handy just in case.

964 2018-12-13 22:11:27 I’ll got a spray bottle with oil , leave in and a little bit of water in it . I suppose to spray it on my hair every day and either twist it or braid but it’s gotta to been every other day.
965 2018-12-13 22:11:18 See if you can get any books by Dr Jim Cairns he was a prolific writer and one of his books I read was "Oil on Troubled Water!" a fascinating read!
966 2018-12-13 22:11:14 No you want to be a petroleum engineers but the oil extraction process is quiet automated these days (pathologically cyclical nature of oil & the expensiveness of labour are the main driver) so you kind of have to make sure that you’re... special.
967 2018-12-13 22:11:12 If Russia wanted to bargain to make it less outrageous they could let Ukraine keep the oil and gas in Crimea so they can retain their energy independence, a dowry..

970 2018-12-13 22:10:42 Getting harder to peddle the snake oil for CryptoBros!
971 2018-12-13 22:10:36 Who is we, you Radical Islamic Terrorist ??? The USA is now exporting oil, with pipelines and plants being built. No oil required, Jihad to You.
972 2018-12-13 22:10:35 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which [are] at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:
973 2018-12-13 22:10:32 We have always had several of our own banks, and bank notes. We meet the criteria for the EU membership. We have 65% of Europe’s oil & gas, 25% offshore wind, 10% tidal power 90% of UK hydro power. Massive tourist, food & drink, IT industries.

976 2018-12-13 22:09:29 Is there an essential oil to stop douche bag teenagers from being douche bags?

*Add refined & artificially colored foods to "Things that trigger spontaneous massive orgasms" for Trump & GOP & magats. (Along with charcoal, oil, toxic pesticides, radioactive waste & concrete.)
978 2018-12-13 22:09:04 @CNBC banks are down perhaps pricing in affect of oil drop on Porfolios?
979 2018-12-13 22:08:57 Was his oil level low?
980 2018-12-13 22:08:45 More than 30 yrs since Simpson/Mazzoli we are arguing over morality of a fence vs wall. I support the strongest border security, whatever cost by whatever means, at same time as a native Texan also know these are real ppl with real lives. Gov failed us all
981 2018-12-13 22:08:38 #ooc get some CBD oil and a vape pen instead
982 2018-12-13 22:08:36 Thing is you don't grow gears by benching, practicing etc. You can oil, them etc but def not aqcuire them.
983 2018-12-13 22:08:34 This resolution has no practical implication. NONE. Saudis control oil. They can give Russia military bases. They control Iran. They are needed for Middle East stability. They buy our arms. Yes, Khashoggi murder is despicable, but let’s not live in la la land - be practical.
984 2018-12-13 22:08:03 He was asked about this by the two CBI Agents and he said he didn't know... he was scared and wasn't thinking. That he carried one of them up to the catwalk & put that child in the first one and then carried the 2nd child up & just put her in the other oil tank. #disgusting
985 2018-12-13 22:07:56 @realDonaldTrump  I only need two months to rest, when I'm cool, we'll be storming. With all the power of the boycott of oil and never give up threats. By changing the regime in 2019, your victory in the 2020 election will be guaranteed, good luck
986 2018-12-13 22:07:49 Hey everyone! I’m in my room now if you’d like to come say hello!! First goal is coconut oil on my boobs
987 2018-12-13 22:07:46 What is a good snack that's not high in saturated fat, sugar or oil and doesn't have to be made????
988 2018-12-13 22:07:33 @realDonaldTrump the fake case of Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran was a solid reason to return. The withdrawal of the Tramp and the failure to reach Iran's oil is our red line, and if I gain my strength, the opposition must escape
989 2018-12-13 22:07:32 BTW - "huge surplus in the budget?" You sure about that? We've paid off all the money stolen from the Oil and Gas Trust Fund? We aren't using one time money like the BP settlement? We have "huge surplus" of regular revenue over budgeted spending?
 @JohnArchibald @WarOnDumb
990 2018-12-13 22:07:15 Does anyone else eat all the crispy residue left over in the tray from roast potatoes or am I the only fat sack of shit eating , quite literally, roasted oil?
991 2018-12-13 22:07:04 @realDonaldTrump Capitalism will see that until April Iran's oil exports will go down to zero, and Trump's government will not yield to your blackouts. Once again I am sorry to break my speeches, but I have no choice,
992 2018-12-13 22:06:49 *They're* only in their group because of their oil (theirs supports pensions for all, we sold ours off) and fishing (they're in the top 3 fish exporting nations while fishing is 0.15% of our economy).
993 2018-12-13 22:06:19 Sounds lovely. What's your secret for the perfect roasted potato? Mine is garlic olive oil.
994 2018-12-13 22:06:15 Hit the nail right on the head! Obama was a walking disaster who talked like a snake oil salesman!
995 2018-12-13 22:06:06 I want a loaf of bread n a large pile of olive oil n balsamic vinegar on it and I can’t think about anything else
996 2018-12-13 22:05:58 They already are. They run oil, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, energy, the IMF, the WTO, the World Bank, the EU, the UN, not to mention the global drugs market.
997 2018-12-13 22:05:49 They're angry because they placed their hopes in a corrupt, sleazy, snake oil salesman, who turned out to be worse than everything they claimed they hated, but they're too arrogant to admit they've been conned, so they take their rage out on everyone, but the man who conned them.
998 2018-12-13 22:05:45 Changed the whole industry into short cycle projects rather than the oil needed.
999 2018-12-13 22:05:31 US would take Alberta in under 24 hours. Their Socialist oil hating premier will be gone in a few months. It will be glorious to watch Alberta mop BC's butt then...

1002 2018-12-13 22:05:07 True snake oil salesman. He can put a spin on anything!
1003 2018-12-13 22:05:07 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1004 2018-12-13 22:05:04 わかるよぉおおたまにあるよぉおお
1005 2018-12-13 22:05:02 @realDonaldTrump With the support of Saudi Arabia, Iran's oil exports could reach zero by April, and should reach zero, no one can save Iran's terrorist regime. My tweets and comments from my friends were effective on Facebook and neutralized their conspiracies
1006 2018-12-13 22:04:59 Just imagine, Twitterverse, a bottle of baby oil, a two-sided dildo, and the sweet perfect asses of @DanicaxDanalix and @BBWMELSC. The duo I call The Sextasy Twins. A @plumperpass and Southern Charms crossover.

1008 2018-12-13 22:04:57 Imagine if the $$$$$ spent on defense and alliances related to oil were put towards new energy sources, renewable energy
1009 2018-12-13 22:04:57 Ban use of fossil fuels in houses for starters give proper grant to replace yer earning too much revenue from oil
1010 2018-12-13 22:04:56 Freezing can't seem to stay warm. Know heats running don't want to turn it up. Oil ain't cheap ya know. Damn A rabs.

1012 2018-12-13 22:04:15 Haha it does say blow the candle out before adding oil. Your way looks more fun though!
1013 2018-12-13 22:04:11 I’ve been taking starflower oil and this has easily been my best cycle for over a year
1014 2018-12-13 22:03:45 Lovin the oil idea
1015 2018-12-13 22:03:45 I find it interesting when Wilson jumps on a cause like this (right though it is) in an attempt to appear empathetic and progressive, even though he's called for oil critics to be hanged...many times he's said that. Oh well, gotta get your PR, eh?
1016 2018-12-13 22:03:38 Whats a good oil I can use on my scalp?
1017 2018-12-13 22:02:48 Quebec receives 34bn dollars of transfer payments made up of mostly oil and other dirty industries money, if you pay you bills with billions of dollars of oil money claiming you’re a green economy is a lie.
1018 2018-12-13 22:02:25 Question for #OOTT folks : To what degree might #WTI Houston #Oil prices get if/when all proposed crude pipeline projects get built to ship crude to the GC from shale plays/storage hubs destined for export come 2019/2020 or later (trade disputes notwithstanding)? #oilandgas
1019 2018-12-13 22:02:23 The great switch over to free internet is one of the most glorious clusterfucks I have ever seen, and being from the oil field I have seen some doozies. I have about reached the, “God damn send drugs, guns and money!”, stage. LOL
1020 2018-12-13 22:02:22 Yes well they have not realized that the US doesn't want them.  B.C. will survive this nightmare and am engaged with the right people.  From a Risk Management perspective, they will bankrupt us and then the change will occur.  Alberta has a small population/premier hates oil.
1021 2018-12-13 22:02:19 Thanks! Leadbelcher spray. 50:50 nuln oil normal/gloss all over. Dry brush necron compound. Then 2 coats green/blue gem paint and lahmian medium mix. Roughly 5 parts blue, 2 green, 7 medium. Just slapped on.
1022 2018-12-13 22:02:14 US markets will continue to exist for many, many many products made of oil/gas or those that require oil/gas (automobiles, plastics, air travel, meat industry etc etc etc). So corporations will continue causing emissions until we intencivize global, cheap renewable energy
1023 2018-12-13 22:02:12 にーておやありー！
1024 2018-12-13 22:02:02 Ummm.. What do you think will happen the moment we start selling our oil with a currency other than USD?

1030 2018-12-13 22:01:16 Agreed, it's also annoying that they spend all this time oiling up then when the business starts the oil disappears. It's like, work on your story and character building brah.
1031 2018-12-13 22:01:14 What’s better for holidays than a smell of overused burned cooking oil mixed with genetically modified chicken in your fireplace. Oh Xmas A perfect gift for Trump!
1032 2018-12-13 22:01:09 I tried CBD Oil and it did nothing for me either. I even looked at higher strengths but I'd would of needed a loan for it especially with how small the bottles are xxx

1039 2018-12-13 22:00:36 Malta has the presidency, but France & Germany run the show. The problem is the EU Commission. Scotland's fishing waters yield very little due to EU quota hopping law, which means EU co's land most of our fish! And problem with Scots oil is green policy & extraction cost.

1048 2018-12-13 22:00:02 You boycott Alberta oil only though? 
Not Saudi, not Russian, not US? Then talk about morals when your province pays billions to those countries for their oil?

If you don’t care about my pfp, don’t bring it up. It was all you said in your first comment.

1052 2018-12-13 21:58:50 So fun. Learned myself shortly after moving here and [embarrassingly] allowing the oil to run out not once but thrice. 

We are on an automatic delivery schedule now.
1053 2018-12-13 21:58:46 I was paying for my oil change.
Jiffy Lube Guy: Nice ring! Are you getting married?
Me: Yeah!
JLB: OHMYGODMETOO CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
Then we talking about weddings for a while and when I went to leave he said, "Have a nice day! Maybe when you come back I'LL have a ring too!"
1054 2018-12-13 21:58:30 Correct...why we kiss their ass so much, especially after 9/11, baffles me. Gotta be more than just oil.
1055 2018-12-13 21:58:24 It's an infection called herpes. Annoiting oil can't cure shit. She should better see a doctor.
1056 2018-12-13 21:58:18 It is the same thing.  Tax dollars are given to oil entities from our government for whatever reason. Call it what you please, the end result is the same.
1057 2018-12-13 21:58:16 Trying to catch the game winning pass in the Super Bowl with baby oil on your hands
1058 2018-12-13 21:58:13 I suppose you don't know what the word 'transition' means. How about finally put our tax dollars into R&D for renewable products/resources/and energy subsidies making small changes along the way, instead of purchasing pipelines for the dirtiest kinds of oil.
1059 2018-12-13 21:57:50 I love having the day off because despite waking up at 11AM I got my oil changed, talked with my advisor, wrote two cover letters, went to the gym, the dentist, and wrapped some presents all by 5PM. Time for a nap.
1060 2018-12-13 21:57:48 I also discovered that my favourite lotion that's the only thing that works for me and that I can get easily has questionably-sourced palm oil 
1061 2018-12-13 21:57:41 says rag funded by middle east oil producers.

1063 2018-12-13 21:57:24 Got my license for Washington, paid my bills, got an oil change finally.....this is what I get excited for.
1064 2018-12-13 21:57:23 Skunk Oil might work.
1065 2018-12-13 21:56:55 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
1066 2018-12-13 21:56:51 also i still need to look into rosehip oil fffff

1068 2018-12-13 21:56:47 I gotta remember to put this oil on my scalp today!
1069 2018-12-13 21:56:32 I can no longer spend winter in the UK. My skin is suffering  looking at pics from summer and I looked to juicy but now...  and however much oil I use it just dries up.

1073 2018-12-13 21:56:11 Navarro continues to live under the Trump economy. She accepts pay raises tax cuts hundreds of jobs now an economy that will have independence from all countries with oil. Less worry from Illegal aliens that will realize we have laws to follow.  Ana needs to go elsewhere and live
1074 2018-12-13 21:55:47 O rly? Big oil has been there since Arco's Robert O. Anderson personally funded the first Earth Day in 1970. That's because solar and wind require fossil fuels as backup. That's why Germany's carbon output went up, not down, when they went with "renewables."
1075 2018-12-13 21:55:36 The real travesty is all the illegal gas flaring happening for the sake of higher light oil output.  A much cleaner energy source, and operators are burning it off into the atmosphere and warming the globe in the pursuit of unwanted, overly-light barrels of crude.

1077 2018-12-13 21:55:28 @CBCNS When I visited Sable in 86 oil rigs were  off shore & an emergency center ready to go. Today we must protect the area.
1078 2018-12-13 21:55:26 There is also the hidden Agenda of #China.#Explore and search for #GAS & #OIL and #mineral resources of our long maritime sea territory. We don't have a State which controls its #onshore security but we are giving rights to Big States to almost take over our #maritime resources.
1079 2018-12-13 21:55:07 Great. When the price of oil doubles, presumably those senators will be happy to take the blame.
1080 2018-12-13 21:55:07 I just bought one of these. I am real interested to see how it works. But I would also like to use a microscope with oil immersion capabilities as well as capability to connect to computer.

1089 2018-12-13 21:53:48 But if it’s ashy you won’t oil it lol
1090 2018-12-13 21:53:46 Hydrogen can be made from water using solar, wind power, and from methane as is done now in refining. Carbon dioxide from the latter can be injected into oil reservoirs that have lost pressure, and used to recover additional oil.
1091 2018-12-13 21:53:46 @Rose_of_Sharon8 was wondering if you've heard about cbd oil and all of its medical benefits?
1092 2018-12-13 21:53:44 A lot of Albertans did, I was one of them. The worse enemy is Trudeau and Butts. 
If you look at the WWF's mandate when he was in charge it was to shut down the oil sands and he is trying. 
Love or hate it if the oil sands close we become a welfare nation for a long time
1093 2018-12-13 21:53:34 You don't expect the oil companies to give you gas for free...

1098 2018-12-13 21:52:59 2011 5.7L I didn't know what vlom was either until my mine exploded. It's part of the manifold that controls oil flow to the cam and lifters
1099 2018-12-13 21:52:57 "Effectively subsidized" is not the same thing. I'm fine with ending all corporate welfare, but again, oil actually works. Let the private sector experiment with alternative energy. T. Boone Pickens lost $1 billion investing in wind. That's his $, so it's fine by me. 0 taxpayer $
1100 2018-12-13 21:52:51 THERE IS NO GREEN NEW DEAL. It’s a concept. Kamala Harris has an actual record we can look to - LCV scorecard? 100%. She created the Environmental Justice Unit as DA in San Francisco and threw the book at U-Haul, and others responsible for the Cosco Busan oil spill.

1104 2018-12-13 21:52:23 So you lot can sit and watch a Tory government cripple the poor and the disabled. Sit and watch them bomb innocent kids in the Middle East. Sit and watch a Tory in a red tie (Tony Blair) follow a mad American into Iraq to rob oil. But it’s all Jeremy Corbyns fault.

1113 2018-12-13 21:51:36 In the 1400s. Boiling oil from the battlements, moats, and drawbridges. What a simpleton!

1115 2018-12-13 21:51:20 I denied it? By the way I need a source on why shifting our economy off of oil would create 25 million, but how many jobs will be killed?
1116 2018-12-13 21:51:09 The real issue isn't US oil production or imports, but petrodollar. Lose that game, and it's Katie-bar-the-door on de-dollarization. Trump should be focusing on petroyuan, instead of trade, IP theft, or even China 2025. The most immediate threat to our grandchildren is petroyuan.
1117 2018-12-13 21:51:03 Do you know lagos makes 5 times what Akwa Ibom has as revenue and buhari has lagos already. So what’s the big deal about Akwa Ibom? Akwa Ibom dey benefit from the oil directly or thru sharing like every other state.

1126 2018-12-13 21:50:19 Whistler is 100% dependent on oil and gas for it’s existence. Every single tourist has a massive carbon footprint to get there, everything a tourist consumes had to be brought up to a mountain. Sushi at the peak of Whistler has a massive carbon footprint.

1132 2018-12-13 21:49:34 Tread carefully.  The countries' interests are intertwined when it comes to trade and oil and the fight against an expanding Iran.   The Saudi Arabia & US relationship is not built on shared Democratic values. Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy and religiously conservative.
1133 2018-12-13 21:49:32 We're now producing more oil than the Saudis.

1148 2018-12-13 21:48:32 @LindseyGrahamSC you can act so tough about Saudi Arabia right now but you know what you're the one that can afford oil in your fucking car I can't. And it's going up $1.96 right now. you going to pay for that now for me or for the rest of the middle class America?
1149 2018-12-13 21:48:31 u should try CBD oil

1151 2018-12-13 21:48:18 Depending on how you look at it, it's cheaper than oil paints 
1152 2018-12-13 21:48:02 Venezuela Saudi and Russia have over 66 % of the world oil one bad move and America will see oil above $200 barrel sinking the USA economy isolating USA. Uranium one deal and now a Russian bomber in Venezuela but u not talking about that it’s bigger than khashoggi .
1153 2018-12-13 21:47:59 truly none taken i know i don’t exude “change ur oil filter” vibes

1157 2018-12-13 21:47:23 I stopped coconut oil and it calmed down, but it took another 6whole months to get my skin back to where I didn't look like I had a rash all over my face.
1158 2018-12-13 21:47:18 Billions of dollars spent on what? Investing in Canadians? You can shove that right up your ass. Hundreds of millions on illegal border crossers, killing the oil industry, throwing around a moral compass when called out on his policy failures?
1159 2018-12-13 21:47:01 Your ignorant hypothesis(not a theory and I'm sure you will not  become informed) is  wrong. With trump burning more coal, oil, & gas, not joining all other countries in Paris accord, and continued lying 6056+ times to US people, climate change will get terrible. GOD save us
1160 2018-12-13 21:47:00 Lol I feel ya so much. I’ve had good success with bio oil, vitamin e and coconut oil - however, it can take multiple applications per day across several months to see a big difference.
1161 2018-12-13 21:46:55 I like Medieval Times. Let's build the wall. Can we have the catapults, moats, boiling oil, chainmail and jousting too?
1162 2018-12-13 21:46:49 Why can't we just acknowledge that Jose despite what the media is saying is actually rebuilding the team and that this will take time and money too especially in these age of Neymar-like transfers and oil money
1163 2018-12-13 21:46:47 Coconut oil ruined my face for almost a year. I used it for 6mo to only remove makeup. It was great at first, but then I started breaking out so bad. Refused to believe it was coconut oil, then my skin became extremely sensitive and I had comedones and pustules everywhere

1168 2018-12-13 21:46:25 Skills and jobs from oil & gas...plant design, construction, high pressure compression etc...can transition to the new hydrogen energy economy providing fuel for transport and other uses. Hydrogen infrastructure can develop alongside the oil industry.
1169 2018-12-13 21:46:22 Hey @tedlieu, you should not be giving @WilkowMajority any attention. He desperately needs it to stay relevant. He is not having arguments in good faith. He is selling snake oil to a contingent of people who want to bury their heads in the dirt. His tag-line says it all.
1170 2018-12-13 21:46:18 No, to do next to nothing is easy. Nations have allowed major disruption to go to war over oil. Why isn't preserving human habitat worth disruption?

13 billion dollars SA spent as humanitarian aid to Yemen in past 3 years only.

1184 2018-12-13 21:44:39 Oil changes are overrated 
1185 2018-12-13 21:44:38 Always suspicious of anything that comes out of Calle's vanity project, yet I have to say, though, that I've become one of these CBD-oil-for-arthritis, low-THC-edible-for-insomnia kind of people.
1186 2018-12-13 21:44:30 You would think that a front group for the oil industry would be able to afford better graphic designers for their posts accusing pro-Earth groups of being front groups.
1187 2018-12-13 21:44:26 I am sure the Internet can throw up several hundered “cures” involving prayer, snake oil, or smoking hash. Stick with the oncologists, they seem to be working.

1196 2018-12-13 21:43:26 Neem oil is also good, and there these vitamins for hair called Pantogar (amazon). Thyroid problems usually cause hair loss and hair thining so you should ask your doctor to get it checked.
1197 2018-12-13 21:43:21 But Norway is one of the biggest exporters of oil in the world...
1198 2018-12-13 21:42:57 If you are looking for me to say oil companies yes they make their profits.
For the little guys like you and I we can't change the fact that the world is petro based but we can change our govt

1205 2018-12-13 21:41:54 another issue with this approach is that climate change is a global problem. If we restructure our economy here, push oil/gas and every other energy company out, they just set up shop in China and India. The US contributes 15% of global emissions, China is a larger contributor
1206 2018-12-13 21:41:52 It's against the Rule of the Jungle for producers to sell oil in anything except dollars. Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddifi learned their lessons the hard way, and that's literal in Gaddifi's case.

1234 2018-12-13 21:38:54 Tu rigoles ? Les "prévisions" du club de Rome se sont toutes révélées fausses : pas de peak oil, retardement sans cesse du réchauffement... Ah non dérèglement climatique à plus tard.

1238 2018-12-13 21:38:17 Also big oil continues to export most of what we produce and we import what we need here. it doesn't make sense to not keep what we need here first , but I guess it doesn't matter were dependent on outside sources of oil.

1258 2018-12-13 21:35:34 bc the oil companies are without a doubt the highest contributing lobbyists and are like the main reason we invaded iraq and afghanistan and they gotta keep making their trillions. same with big pharma and legalizing marijuana. money runs everything and we’re all being fucked

1267 2018-12-13 21:34:36 If Saudi Arabia cuts back oil exports to the united state it really isn’t that big of a deal we can crank up production in the Permian basin in Texas and meet the demand. More of our hard-earned money stays here in the United States

1305 2018-12-13 21:31:04 Why not pass laws to combat climate change?

1) Ban all SUVs.
2) Put a $3 a gallon tax on gas.
3) Double the price of electricity and heating.

This would force Americans to stop buying from Oil Barrons.

Your idea?

1321 2018-12-13 21:30:10 Good question cosmoh Baby oil is made of mineral oil. Mineral oil is something completely foreign to the human body. It is a synthetic oil which is a byproduct of the distillation of gasoline from crude oil.
1322 2018-12-13 21:30:03 Which, again, is an agency that miiiiiight be motivated to conclude something in favor of the oil industry.
1323 2018-12-13 21:29:55 It wasn't the best choice of words, but what @morningmika said was exactly true. You, Jared & Pompeo are letting an evil wannabe dictator walk all over the values *real* Americans hold dear. It's time to dump the greedy backasswards Saudis & find clean alternatives to oil.
1324 2018-12-13 21:29:53 Apt analogy. In 1970, known oil reserves were projected to run out in 30 years assuming 3% annual increase in use. The world's use grew more than twice as fast but, 48 years later, we still have more proven reserves than estimated in 1970!

with enough time that becomes Tight Oil, which is what you name Shale oil, that becomes light crude and then heavy crude

1355 2018-12-13 21:27:00 食パンさん、おはよーございます
1356 2018-12-13 21:26:52 Send me some of the favorite tracks right now. Going to be doing laptop stuff and hearing music while I wait on my oil change in a bit
1357 2018-12-13 21:26:50 @SenatorIsakson - amazing how we never saw relief at the gas pump when oil prices plummeted over the summer.  I bet you let them stick it to us again now that the Saudis have threatened decreasing Supply...
#EpicFail
1358 2018-12-13 21:26:44 coconut oil and starch, mostly.
1359 2018-12-13 21:26:39 Both. I believe his policies are triggering our worse impulses. And as a person I believe he is a malignant narcissist, and a charlatan.... a snake oil saleman
1360 2018-12-13 21:26:32 Finally i have your attention. Now if corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
1361 2018-12-13 21:26:30 Biblically one is only obligated to tithe grain, wine and olive oil. Rabbinically all fruits and vegetables added, but not outside original borders of Israel (like Bet Shaan).
1362 2018-12-13 21:26:17 The latter
1363 2018-12-13 21:26:08 You would still give a chance for kerogen radiowave extraction of shale oil instead of fracking for tight oil?

i mean, i read some papers out that it could be possible extract a barell of oil from kerogenic rocks at 15U$S/bbl
1364 2018-12-13 21:26:03 @cbdbrothers hi there could you please assist me with what would be the best oil from you for sleeping, no pain or anxiety would just like to sleep better, thankyou
1365 2018-12-13 21:25:51 In a way, a new oil crisis would be good. It just might be the beginning of the end of western dependence und cruel oil.
1366 2018-12-13 21:25:50 his buttery fingers like a dipstick, checking your oil and your temperature
1367 2018-12-13 21:25:47 What did I say? Mess with the Prince of Saudi Arabia & he will raise oil prices! What ignorant Senators!! Your faces are attached to the disaster you're creating.
1368 2018-12-13 21:25:45 そうはいかないのが〇〇なんだよねーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
1369 2018-12-13 21:25:45 サンタさん暑そうな格好ですよね！？
1370 2018-12-13 21:25:43 Love? for a 15 year old, guy you can do better, all our education shouldn't be put to waste in supporting inanities like this
1371 2018-12-13 21:25:41 Did build a hut on wheels but by time I got 20 x 10lb chickens in there it took some pushing!  Have an old cut down oil tank I use too that can roll which is good.  No floor in it tho as I find it holds disease and sweats. Bit of hay in the bottom and they love it
1372 2018-12-13 21:25:36 Oil to dilute peppery taste
1373 2018-12-13 21:25:34 Eat real food healthy food, joint oil and maca in my coffee in the morning and #BDE
1374 2018-12-13 21:25:24 It’s called a diversified portfolio. Green Technology will still require plastic to manufacture. Where does plastic come from? Oil which also goes into pharmaceutical drugs, fertilizer, pesticides and modern convenience devices. The oil Barron’s will be sticking around for a bit
1375 2018-12-13 21:25:15 99% of Alberta oil exports end up in the USA.  With or without Canada, nothing changes.
1376 2018-12-13 21:25:13 Remember this tweet in 2020 when your hyping Beta Oil' Rourke as the white knight to takedown Donald the Dragon.
1377 2018-12-13 21:24:47 If you're compliant with torture & murder by Saddam of more than a 1/2 million Iraqis-3/4 million Iranians-use of poison gas-invading & torching oil wells in Kuwait-Then his removal was a terrible idea-and you've have a soul mate-Sen Rand Paul
1378 2018-12-13 21:24:44 I cooking Fried rice, I've poured the raw rice inside hot oil, what else?
1379 2018-12-13 21:24:28 Aameen Ya Rabbi!
1380 2018-12-13 21:24:26 Aameen Rabbi!
1381 2018-12-13 21:24:26 Agreed with sautéing however if it’s heavy in oil I will move it to the back for safety reasons. Can’t have oil bubbles popping on my skin no sir
1382 2018-12-13 21:24:24 say the oil monarchy that use slaves and make their women second class citizens.
1383 2018-12-13 21:24:17 The oil barons are busy diversifying, investing in sustainable energy. Watch that they don't claim offsets or shut down those markets.
1384 2018-12-13 21:24:11 @SenatorDurbin @TammyforIL please resist the oil companies and #climatedeniers who want to eviscerate vehicle efficiency. The short term profits pocketed by the #KochBrothers will be eclipsed by the cost of accelerating environmental damage.
1385 2018-12-13 21:24:05 What I'd give to be able to rub oil into those titties and ass!
1386 2018-12-13 21:24:01 Any fucking anti-democratic airbrushed bold-colour poster totalitarian vanity projects built on skulls will do when you're King of the Edgelords, covered in body oil and jerking off to this week's voguish authoritarianism. He's just Eric Trump with a gym-stalking ticket.
1387 2018-12-13 21:23:56 Don't practice what they preach. Mika and Poindexter are traitors. We need a new Fairness Doctrine to keep them honest. And Telecommunications Act of 1934 forbade monopolies of our media. 8 corporations own our media when overturned in 96. Break em up like Standard Oil.
1388 2018-12-13 21:23:52 On the subject of plastics. Would u take an interest in bringing about a plastic to oil, "pyrolissis", operation for the general Ottawa area. We need this everywhere, yesterday. A very underpromoted, ultimate solution to the plastic problem.
1389 2018-12-13 21:23:50 As an #oilers fan who lives far away from oil country, people tend to give me the most random Oilers merch cuz they "saw it and knew you were a fan". Last week it was a ladies watch, this week it's a Santa in an oilers rocketship decoration.
1390 2018-12-13 21:23:33 Ameen. Mugu
1391 2018-12-13 21:23:28 Everyone's skin is different. I only get breakouts if there are hair products on my skin, or there is too much oil build up, or I'm not getting enough water. I have eczema as well so for me it's easier to drink water and use oatmeal. So got ppl whose acne isnt as serious
1392 2018-12-13 21:23:26 The dumb down of US is complete.
The biggest mistake US has ever done was to invade a country with no legitimate reason. NO WMD were there, it was a lie to commit war crimes and steal oil and do big bussiness for the power.
1393 2018-12-13 21:23:23 gonna start putting coconut oil in my hair tomorrow in my futile attempt to get it to grow quicker... if it grows quicker it might discourage my trich too so
1394 2018-12-13 21:23:19 Indeed and people need to be trained to recognise this. Turn up on 'clean oil' day and you might be lucky.... Have reacted to chips from Chinese where oil already used for nutty items - Consider #gluten from previous batter #allergyhour
1395 2018-12-13 21:23:18 Know if u need my story, I will YELL it out.. lol DONT PUT PALM OIL IN MEDICINE , every ingredients should be disclosed, not hidden behind random numbers, freaking unacceptable behaviour LPS.
1396 2018-12-13 21:23:04 rub olive oil on the pieces and let it warm in the oven. It should return some moisture. Put a timer on your list young lady.
1397 2018-12-13 21:22:56 a temp setup to try it out is some tissue with oil on, clipped to the fillament with a peg.
1398 2018-12-13 21:22:51 For one thing, the government doesn’t own the oil, private corporations do, they want to make money so they sell it. Gas prices need to be at a certain number in order to have profit.  Don’t forget how much your State and Federal government tax you on each gallon you buy.
1399 2018-12-13 21:22:50 If it were cheaper no one would need an incentive. You're selling snake oil and you know it. We don't believe either lie. Mother Nature owns the earth, not lying politicians like you. You just want to steal our money via taxes.
1400 2018-12-13 21:22:48 I wish I could build a beautiful mosque for them
1401 2018-12-13 21:22:42 Got the Christmas garland up yesterday. Making the cannibus oil today and day dreaming of the multiple successful businesses I'm running in 2019 that will be fulfilling as they all have to do with my life's purpose.
1402 2018-12-13 21:22:09 Alberta is not the Oil and Gas industry and the Oil and Gas industry is not Alberta, no matter how much they claim to be.
1403 2018-12-13 21:22:06 The lord us your strength
1404 2018-12-13 21:21:58 I always moisturise  but maybe i need to do my moisturiser after i use the oil idk
1405 2018-12-13 21:21:56 For oil, rather.
1406 2018-12-13 21:21:42 I’m a real girl, I’m getting my oil changed. 
1407 2018-12-13 21:21:41 Dinosaurs I’m sure let a little gas out which made earth green & polluted along with dropping. Lots of oil. Then buffalo millions of them also letting a little gas out with droppings. Martha Washington made comments about bad air. No cars or trucks then.
1408 2018-12-13 21:21:34 Oil change for my Honda

1413 2018-12-13 21:20:58 BF and I are making brownies and we’re sat by the oven waiting for them to bake. Suddenly we realise that he put in way too much oil as we see the brownie mixture boiling and bubbling, and my BF yells “BITCH IS YOU MELTING”
1414 2018-12-13 21:20:47 Hmm... that's funny... I thought Republicans were the ones who live oil?
1415 2018-12-13 21:20:45 Anyone of y’all know how to fry ogede dodo without hella oil? 
Tryna eat dodo with every meal and keep a 6pack
1416 2018-12-13 21:20:44 Layer products like you’d layer your clothes. Lightest first, heaviest last. If you’re incorporating any kind of oil that is always your final step. 
1417 2018-12-13 21:20:36 It is. But also remember he’s trying to kill clean energy for his oil buddies. They’re companies are dying out and they know it and hope by killing the land in Alaska and what ocean is left, they just might survive. Meanwhile once these recourses are gone, so are we.
1418 2018-12-13 21:20:23 My guesses are either Vince McMahon or an oil painting of Ronald Reagan.
1419 2018-12-13 21:20:21 Their current campuses are or plan to be carbon neutral soon. Hopefully this new one won't be tempted by cheap oil in Texas? 
1420 2018-12-13 21:20:21 rosehip oil works wonders

1423 2018-12-13 21:20:11 This is why the engine of Washington DC is running on very old rotten oil. We need to drain it and fill new oil. Old white men need to go!

1425 2018-12-13 21:19:52 Sorry you misinterpreted his speech. He didn't mean "inflation" -- he meant his Oil "trading account". Next time, listen more closely. Those are NOT marbles in his mouth ....

1431 2018-12-13 21:19:07 You are ignoring corporate taxation and royalty revenue.  Don’t worry, equalization only ignores Quebec’s hydro and potential revenue of their oil and gas, but makes damn sure to squeeze every drop of blood from Alberta.

1437 2018-12-13 21:18:44 Palm oil is going to kill us all
1438 2018-12-13 21:18:28 Not in the traditional sense, no, that is valid. But they are effectively subsidized regardless. Oil does work, true, but it is filthy. The voluntary boycott of oil is a nice fantasy, but we are too dependent on it to try it.
1439 2018-12-13 21:18:25 Thanks to the Senate resolution to stop aid to Saudi Arabia (which constitutes a slap in the face to S.A.) the price of oil/gas will go up. Thanks to the idiot DemocRats in the Senate. The Yemen airport is now controlled by rebels to receive aid from Iran  - via missiles, etc!

1467 2018-12-13 21:15:36 @seanhannity has Cavuto, lost his Frigging mind ? He just showed the Senate Ranting and Raving about Sanctions on Saudi Arabia and Removal of The Crown Prince, two seconds latter he's Screaming about The Saudi's raising Oil Prices. Really?
1468 2018-12-13 21:15:25 & in terms of pure money - Tens of billions is nothing next to the cost of cleaning up the oil network (and the cost of keeping it clean and relatively safe). Ah yes, and then we all go to war over oil. That costs a bit too. Electricity I capture on my roof caused those fires?
1469 2018-12-13 21:15:24 Bobbin shape doesn't matter unless it's going in the machine. For a machine kit get her a wee bottle of oil, a tiny lint brush. Look at the manufacturer's website or a local repair shop for specific bits.

1475 2018-12-13 21:15:05 Did anyone ever ask #ChrisWatts why he put the girls in separate oil tanks? Why not both in one tank. Makes no sense...but then none if it makes real sense, psychopath that he is.

1481 2018-12-13 21:14:26 If AOC & her fellow greeniac leftists hate oil so much, they should take a green stand and boycott oil. They boycott everything else. Stop using oil. Turn in your laptops and cellphones. No more selfies. Every selfie they take helps oil companies.

1483 2018-12-13 21:14:14 @TeamCavuto Neil,  What I do not understand is bragging about how we are exporting oil and we are independent of foreign oil. Can you please enlighten us as to the basic dynamics of oil. Thanks
1484 2018-12-13 21:14:09 Perfect. you put some oil to make your body so shiny?
1485 2018-12-13 21:13:55 if pimples are your problem i recommend using oil free stuff

1489 2018-12-13 21:13:20 Creep! Lol If there is one thing you notice about Kay Burley is that she gives the appearance of being able to give as good as she gets and would say that off-camera the said numbskulls would have got a suitable riposte, somewhere along the lines of a fleet of oil ships!

1491 2018-12-13 21:13:08 I'm not sure you understand how that works. Oil companies do not receive "subsidies" in the traditional sense. Also, oil actually works. Anyone attacking big oil should just voluntarily boycott oil. Turn in your laptop and smartphone now. Take a green stand.
1492 2018-12-13 21:13:08 Homemade popcorn and I use Safflower oil. Great for your skin and high in essential omega oil. I place 1/2 cup in a zip lock bag. If I want a dash of pop, I add 1 teaspoon @LawrysSeasoning

1494 2018-12-13 21:12:54 little funfact: if $oil were to continue on this trendline it would hit 100$ by christmas
1495 2018-12-13 21:12:41 @sabre666 @AV8 hopefully temporary .. let's burn sum oil!
1496 2018-12-13 21:12:36 Ok, I do not understand. If America is now energy independence and now exporting oil. Why would we be raising gas prices. Stop selling our oil, save it for America, and keep our gas prices the same. Someone please help me understand
1497 2018-12-13 21:12:34 Stay humble but be bold - God has never failed you yet! Abundant rain is coming! Get ready for a pouring out of oil and the new wine!
1498 2018-12-13 21:12:26 Roasting fresh sprouts and even pan frying them in a little oil is so much better than the microwaved frozen packages.
1499 2018-12-13 21:12:18 Shocking what palm oil is doing to them. Bad stuff!
1500 2018-12-13 21:12:09 i would prefer that eastern Canada would reduce its dependency on foreign oil, and to get QC to drop its opposition to pipelines. but that's a different issue
1501 2018-12-13 21:12:07 Coffee with coconut oil or butter .... weird things that work
1502 2018-12-13 21:12:02 Thank u!!! Just want perfect skin  I’ve got bio oil that I used for when my ears were sewn up dunno why I never tried it on my face
1503 2018-12-13 21:11:58 Allowing oil barons to become energy barons would be good for the economy.Please forget about the economic justice thing because there is already economic justice with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1991 Civil Rights Act.Thanks.
1504 2018-12-13 21:11:45 Jamaican black caster oil smells so bad 
1505 2018-12-13 21:11:43 the perfect mixture of prussian blue and green light to make eagles primary color in oil
1506 2018-12-13 21:11:42 私他人のそういう事情気になります
1507 2018-12-13 21:11:32 damn girl are you oil and water because we don’t mix
1508 2018-12-13 21:11:32 wow coconut oil really changed my life
1509 2018-12-13 21:11:25 Crisco oil lips are pretty awful too!
1510 2018-12-13 21:11:24 Oil companies use their own money? What? You must have forgotten about all the tax money B. Oil squeez3s us for.
1511 2018-12-13 21:11:10 A nightmare in USA is now a nightmare in Canada.  Ford's disgusting favouritism is mimicking the Trump W.H.  Someone give him a large dose of Castor Oil.
1512 2018-12-13 21:11:01 @DogBountyHunter They are having really good results with CBD oil. I had RA and the pain was so bad I almost had to quit working. I started taking CBD and I am pain free and off all opiods. I would give it a try with Beth.
1513 2018-12-13 21:10:55 I stuff the cavity with halved garlic bulbs, quartered lemons, and then vigorously salt and pepper the top with a nice olive oil rub and a generous sprinkle of Penzey’s roasted garlic. Literally the best chicken ever.
1514 2018-12-13 21:10:54 That's what skull and bones is all about. In 1989 my friend joined the Marines straight out of high school. Figured it had good benefits and the military was a peacetime military. Immediately he was sent to Panama then Bolivia and then Saudi for first gulf war. Drug/oil wars
1515 2018-12-13 21:10:52 I’m afraid not! Marijuana candles and essential oils do not reach into the bloodstream far enough to trigger a psychoactive effect. You may feel relaxed or uplifted from the terpenes released from the oil and candle. 
1516 2018-12-13 21:10:44 @sainsburys why are you selling zoni palm oil in your stores? Do you not know the devastation that stuff wreaks? #PalmOil
1517 2018-12-13 21:10:43 @realDonaldTrump We are now an oil EXPORTER. WE produce ALL THE OIL WE NEED, so explain WHY ANY OTHER COUNTRY CAN MAKE OUR OIL PRICE FLUCTUATE? Just because SA, or any other country, decides to cut production, if we produce all we need, that SHOULD NOT AFFECT OUR PRICE OF OIL.
1518 2018-12-13 21:10:35 We're sorry for the misunderstanding, JR. It appeared as though your frustration was with the wait time since you were given a coupon to make up for our lack of synthetic oil. We hope we can make it up to you another time.
1519 2018-12-13 21:10:33 A bath followed by a hot oil rub down. Yes, please.
1520 2018-12-13 21:10:31 Vitamin e is really good for facial scarring. Bio oil would probably be too oily for your face and could break you out. The body shop vitamin e serum in oil is a dream for facial scars!
1521 2018-12-13 21:10:24 i really burnt the midnight’s oil tonight

1524 2018-12-13 21:10:07 #OIL on the move. Should be a good day for portfolio tomorrow #RRE #GKP #OPHR and another I'm building a position in...
1525 2018-12-13 21:10:04 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
1526 2018-12-13 21:10:03 i don’t know, my esthetician told me i had to use oil free products or else my skin would keep breaking out
1527 2018-12-13 21:09:58 Oil spill too tho for real  Boycott all the pink power ups, they suck 
1528 2018-12-13 21:09:54 Finally getting this dumbass oil change
1529 2018-12-13 21:09:50 Tie this to the case of the woman (her name escapes me) fighting about groundwater contamination & you get a pretty damning picture of how the oil industry has captured the entire regulatory system in Alberta.

1530 2018-12-13 21:09:38 I need to reup on some black seed oil..
1531 2018-12-13 21:09:32 But I heard he didn't die , he went into coma
1532 2018-12-13 21:09:26 I’ve realized that for my hair texture all I need is a leave in conditioner or cream, a lightweight gel and some oil. Anything too heavy my curls will feel weighed down and dry/chalky.
1533 2018-12-13 21:09:17 I’m walking into the car dealership to get an oil change & that’s IT  if these fuckers try to sell me something else, I legally get to run them over one by one
1534 2018-12-13 21:09:16 whaT IF that table is made with palm oil tho?????
1535 2018-12-13 21:09:16 Use tea tree oil
1536 2018-12-13 21:09:15 When you power your Tesla with coal and oil
1537 2018-12-13 21:09:06 I’ve never seen a more Portuguese diet. All you need is some fresh bread, blood sausage and a shit ton of olive oil to smother everything in.
1538 2018-12-13 21:09:00 Bonita charla a la que he podido asistir. Quizá he echado en falta títulos como Lorenzo´s Oil, La fórmula o Extraordinary measures. Pero si hay otra, asistiré.
1539 2018-12-13 21:09:00 Someone just made +21.66% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 52.097 → 52.952 (13.36x leverage)  ~ GRANDIOSE $WTICO $USD
1540 2018-12-13 21:09:00 bio oil/coconut oil, also bit more costly but laser treatment helps if they’re quite deep x
1541 2018-12-13 21:08:56 There's an essential oil made just for nose amputation soothing.
1542 2018-12-13 21:08:52 There is that potential, however teaching children about anthropogenic climate change is not a scare tactic, it's science class. In addition 10 yr olds tend to have less power/money in lobbying policies than oil execs and CEO's.
1543 2018-12-13 21:08:40 Fancy, infused olive oil and vinegar.
1544 2018-12-13 21:08:38 Brunch with some Qatar royals in my cup is all oil.. You know it’s real when ya niggas will take the fall for you..

#Saudi
1546 2018-12-13 21:08:28 My God Almighty 
BOB COKER is pushing the bill against Saudi Arabia. Hell he hates Trump and will do anything to disrupt our economy if it makes Trump look bad even tho it hurts Americans. 
Let's start pumping oil and threaten to pull all our bases out of Saudi Arabia
1547 2018-12-13 21:08:20 JFK?
1548 2018-12-13 21:08:18 what flavor of vape oil would toriel use 
1549 2018-12-13 21:08:18 Todays Action was insane:
- $Oil went parabolic and pumped 4% propably in an effort to stableize equites ?
- $SPX got sold the fuck down every bounce, broke its trendline very clearly and the close in green is nothing short of a miracle 
- $BTC $TLRY died (redflag for longing)
1550 2018-12-13 21:08:16 Apple opening up more offices in Austin and looking for SAP developers? 

Maybe it’s about time I get out of Oil & Gas 
1551 2018-12-13 21:08:08 @sabre666 well ok let's stop producing oil... well see how long the world survives off solar. And oil co has been at all time lows meanwhile
1552 2018-12-13 21:07:43 Yep, for about 5 minutes until oil co.'s raise the price.
1553 2018-12-13 21:07:40 So you'll replace oil barons with corrupt green energy companies. At least oil companies use their own money and produce a product that works. You'll give billions to Solyndra-type in taxpayer dollars, they'll go bankrupt, you'll raise taxes for more "investment."
1554 2018-12-13 21:07:36 olive oil is not meant for cooking. use a medium/high heat oil instead!!
1555 2018-12-13 21:07:35 I’m from Quebec Mr Kenney and i really ashamed and embarrassed by my province. We take the equalization payment from Federal Government, who came in big part from Alberta, but we turn out back to Canadian Oil 
1556 2018-12-13 21:07:32 ...keeping hydropower for themselfs, and getting rich selling oil & gas to others. Last, but not least.
1557 2018-12-13 21:07:19 Go spill oil

1560 2018-12-13 21:07:08 I had a drummer who came to rehearsal 2 hours late! His reason was so funny I couldn’t fire him! When Jiffy Lube won’t change your oil I can’t be mad with you! #Ubertime
1561 2018-12-13 21:07:03 Aunt Jackie’s boo! And black castor oil
1562 2018-12-13 21:06:50 Truffles and extra virgin olive oil linger on my lips.
   Taste me.
1563 2018-12-13 21:06:46 Saudias to slash oil imports. I say pour it on Saudi Arabia!!!
1564 2018-12-13 21:06:43 Loool that money has to go back into the coffers ... so you won’t get your bonuses and the rice and oil is part Hunnie 
1565 2018-12-13 21:06:27 has anyone had any success in getting rid of/fading raised old scars and can recommend any good products? is bio oil good for this??? i have a few  on my face that piss me off so much
1566 2018-12-13 21:06:21 As I then proceed to down oregano oil capsules and echinacea drops.
1567 2018-12-13 21:06:05 I hate oil changes
1568 2018-12-13 21:06:03 took my car in for an oil change today.. I’m 15000 miles over due. Not 150 or 1,500.. FIFTEEN THOUSAND. I literally cannot adult
1569 2018-12-13 21:06:02 Well ES was extremely boring today but oil was great!
1570 2018-12-13 21:05:54 If the money doesn’t stay where it was made..it does cost us..that’s dollars that could be used for infrastructure..or better yet, why not a refinery so we can process our oil and then sell to the world..instead we give it all away, and have lost jobs etc in the meantime 
1571 2018-12-13 21:05:51 I love the duck spring rolls, they are even more delicious then the ones from the Chinese takeaway and they are palm oil free which is a huge bonus! :) #NoPalmOilChristmas
1572 2018-12-13 21:05:39 Beauty question time: I’ve got some stubborn chin acne I’m pretty sure is caused by my skin getting too dry then overproducing oil. Thoughts on cleansers, moisturizers, or other products to address this? It seems to pop back up a year or two after I solve it with a new routine
1573 2018-12-13 21:05:29 Feels like they'd be uniquely positioned in terms of money, knowledge, and facilities, to be the best ones to make Green innovation a reality if they'd ever stop feeding at the oil trough and look to the future.
1574 2018-12-13 21:05:29 No blood for oil, boycott Saudi Arabia!!! $100 a bbl oil & $6-7 a gal gas
1575 2018-12-13 21:05:25 Aww! All of it has potential to be animal tested or contain products eg honey,milk, animal fats. We try to minimise palm oil & plastics (for habitat) too, & nasty chems but are on very tight budget. If you're UK Superdrug is great for lots of budget vegan toiletries, cosmetics.
1576 2018-12-13 21:05:24 Steam your face with a wash cloth for a minute and just a little drip of olive oil (avocado oil if you have it) all over your face then steam again in 10 to get the oil off, use a thick moisturizer
1577 2018-12-13 21:05:13 It really do be like that
1578 2018-12-13 21:05:10 instead of eating during my lunch i’m getting an oil change... cool
1579 2018-12-13 21:05:05 WHILE FARM JOBS MAY BE AN ISSUE, I DOUBT THAT THE CASE CAN BE MADE ABOUT THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY, those jobs are good paying jobs and I don't think they have a big problem filling them
1580 2018-12-13 21:05:05 Dans un film, cette image fugitive d'une station essence avec le gaz oil à 0,88 euro. Je l'ai repassée deux fois au ralenti en pleurant.
1581 2018-12-13 21:05:04 Using a blotting sheet a few times a day helps a tiny bit for me.  Then you don't get oil that breaks your makeup down further.  I also use long wear everything and setting spray.
1582 2018-12-13 21:05:03 We have the oil and u have the weapon.. just it the deal is the deal
1583 2018-12-13 21:05:00 @brittny_mejia just read your article in Kern county, oil dale, and Bakersfield your wrote in 2016. Interesting stuff!
1584 2018-12-13 21:04:55 Thought my car was gonna be back to its normal self after an oil change but naaaaw gotta get my mirror fixed 
1585 2018-12-13 21:04:51 Hey bud? These are lies. HRs 676, 1880 and 1144 never went to a vote and O’Rourke never opposed them. People are trying to infer that he opposed them because he didn’t *cosponsor* them, which is insane. He didn’t take a dime from the oil/gas industries. Those were from workers.
1586 2018-12-13 21:04:46 They should’ve put the Chapter 6 finale right after the oil field raid with Eagle Flies. Doing a last minute train robbery felt forced
1587 2018-12-13 21:04:43 You’re drawing the reasonable conclusion that ... what exactly? I’m a dog? 

Oil & shit both harm the environment.

Not only that, but Quebec has no problem buying oil from other countries. Only Alberta’s do they have issue with. 

But you’re more worried about my pfp
1588 2018-12-13 21:04:40 @MikeMiss975 first of all you don’t put vinegar on a Hoagie either, oil, that’s it! And the brothers put mayo on a cheesesteak which is a way bigger violation!
1589 2018-12-13 21:04:39 Oil prices are trending upwards on the market today as Senate takes action against Saudi Arabia over Khossagi and Yemen.
1590 2018-12-13 21:04:35 Ameen thank you
1591 2018-12-13 21:04:30 Bought one of those big blue 'oil can' Foster's the other night, and an Australian woman in line with me explained it's the beer of choice for all the assholes back in her home country.

1595 2018-12-13 21:04:02 I'm not a big oil fan, I have seen them screw many people over but ALL big corporations are similar and I find it hypocritical to get up in arms about them and then go buy your Nikes or shop at Wal-Mart.
At least Oil pays their people well and is more important in life many ways
1596 2018-12-13 21:03:50 Apko aik ganje (ballad)  ko hair oil aur comb baechna hai
1597 2018-12-13 21:03:48 I don't know which one of yall need to hear this but make sure you get the premium oil change.
1598 2018-12-13 21:03:44 The stitching and the texture look like a worker's canvas overalls that have seen some wear around the cuffs, possibly oil stains
1599 2018-12-13 21:03:40 QC buys Saudi oil. Sorry you agree with that! Have a good one!
1600 2018-12-13 21:03:38 $UWT anyone here not on the UWT train... but own oil stocks and askin wtf.. why oil up and sector flat

1604 2018-12-13 21:03:33 true love is jordan applying oil to my scalp for my psoriasis 
1605 2018-12-13 21:03:14 Saudis raise prices of oil.
US:
So what??

1606 2018-12-13 21:03:06 Need to see Oil hold here if there's even a chance. Some names have held up better like $XOM and $CVX but the offshore plays have been really destroyed. The fact that energy names are down when Oil is up 3% today makes me avoid trying to bottom pick
1607 2018-12-13 21:03:06 More oil news  soon  stay healthy and happy  moisturize  and oil up have a Happy Wednesday #doterra
1608 2018-12-13 21:03:00 The politicians that are going against our president are trying to push sanctions against Saudi Arabia. If they do Saudi Arabia will slash oil production and crude oil can go to $200 a barrel which means 5 to $7 a gallon at the pump
Wake up America
1609 2018-12-13 21:02:49 That vote is just a part of broader efforts against OPEC to bring down oil prices. That murder is just a convenient and well-timed excuse. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn't even bother.
1610 2018-12-13 21:02:41 Bitcoin = Gold

1611 2018-12-13 21:02:39 Being on the outside of an asset makes it easier 2 analyze & being  patient is easier. Been looking at the weed stocks as well as oil, saw months ago that both were gonna drop significantly. Need to do this with crypto; just as excited today as I was last December, perhaps more.
1612 2018-12-13 21:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
1613 2018-12-13 21:02:22 FYI 
We do not have Oil in Spain -as you do in US - and get It from Arab countries, formerly known in my country as the Al-Andalus !
Oil Crisis 1973 anyone...?
1614 2018-12-13 21:02:18 Is this an oil dispute decision? Glad Bernie saw an opportunity to exploit for the sake of Yemen, but i can't believe it's a morality decision.
1615 2018-12-13 21:02:18 Why is my oil Change and tire rotation 120$ bih I got a Mazda Ima need a coupon
1616 2018-12-13 21:02:07 Issey bolte hai chutia kumar illiterate.. International market mein oil prices bad rahe hai gadhe..
1617 2018-12-13 21:01:57 The new place I’m taking my car for oil changes is across the street from the mall so I can spend more money while I’m already upset about paying for the oil change
1618 2018-12-13 21:01:55 They bought it to make sure no oil flowed if they bought it to make the pipeline it would be done but it is not
1619 2018-12-13 21:01:50 I don't watch CNN much. The humanrights violations in Iran are terrible. But when a country leader is involved in a murder, that's of high news value + rightly so. We all live in propaganda bubbles. Saudi-Arabia has been spared criticism bc of oil. Greetings to lovely Lebanon
1620 2018-12-13 21:01:39 And if you really loved your beard, you'd be using my beard oil and wash.
1621 2018-12-13 21:01:38 Next oil rush.
1622 2018-12-13 21:01:36 At this point, all the tea tree oil in the world can’t help my skin
1623 2018-12-13 21:01:32 Perhaps that explains expanding our own oil independence too?
1624 2018-12-13 21:01:30 Who tryna pay for my oil change this weekend
1625 2018-12-13 21:01:25 Wrong again. Moveable type was made in China as well. And I guess the compass, pottery, belt drive which allowed for the industrial revolution, blast furnace,cast iron, civil service exams, India ink,the merit system,  moveable sails, and oil refinement arent important
1626 2018-12-13 21:01:24 Usko dry karke Oil banate hn :/
1627 2018-12-13 21:01:20 Aye my cooking ppl I gotta question can I use virgin oil instead of butter lmao if I’m bout to cook some in a pan

1629 2018-12-13 21:01:04 working in around aberdeen during peak oil time was a nightmare, traffic was chaotic, labour/tories useless, but they will still moan
1630 2018-12-13 21:00:58 Water Witch last friday had a squawk, weird beard, black jack and a salopian on guest cask with neck oil on keg amongst others. By contrast the white cross had a more blonde/amber ale cask choice as opposed to hop forward.
1631 2018-12-13 21:00:56 girl i’m asking for good oil paints this christmas!!! i’m so excited to start working w it again and it’s such a soothing process :)))

1636 2018-12-13 21:00:21 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1638 2018-12-13 21:00:18 So helpful, thank you! That post said as long as you're not having trouble filling the tank it's probably good...I did put the little pump trigger on to auto-fill my tank the other day and it stopped at 3/4 full.  I'll just go ahead and replace it w/ my next oil change. 
1639 2018-12-13 21:00:13 Sis what makeup??? I literally only had mascara, brows and lip oil we stan a natural queen!! ALSO WHEN ARABIC MUSIC PLAYS I TRANSFORM
1640 2018-12-13 21:00:07 Your thick sliced white bread is the best palm oil free product! I have been looking for something like this for a long while since my previous brand stated using palm oil. This bread is free of ‘E’ numbers too! A rare find and it’s lovely! 
1641 2018-12-13 21:00:03 Why didn't anyone tell me Grapeseed oil in my lotion would save my skin?? Also Tumeric masks?? and and rice water and black soap.

1647 2018-12-13 20:59:39 Relentless barrage of memes and exaggerated non-pc opinions. Its sounds like nothing, but holy hell these people couldn't take it. Pansies lol
1648 2018-12-13 20:59:36 They should be on top of the list -with the $440M to Oil Barons for the reef & the Grant system -giving money to their mates!!
1649 2018-12-13 20:59:34 I put it on after my bath or shower. That or baby oil
1650 2018-12-13 20:59:28 To be fair Obama was allowing seismic blasting off the east coats for oil exploration, I remember tweeting him to him to stop
1651 2018-12-13 20:59:28 Thank you, Sen. Collins. Genocide of children is not what we are as a nation. Saudi Wahhabi using U.S. for own personal gains. Need to pressure House to follow suit. Screw Aramco and other intnl oil; we are not their paid mercenaries.
1652 2018-12-13 20:59:27 @MikeMiss975 vinegar is a violation...oil yes and always. But no real Italian sandwich shop puts vinegar. Also a lot of brothers out mayo on everything.
Brothers love mayo.
1653 2018-12-13 20:59:27 Fryers should really have a beeper on them to let you know when the oil is at temp but I'm also not sure if I can handle another kitchen appliance screaming at me.
1654 2018-12-13 20:59:24 #UKOG LSE JBG.

The well has a life expectancy of 20 years.

You don't need water injection for many of those years . Maybe as it bears the end of its life to keep the pressure up if its depleting as much of the oil is extracted. Maybe not.

KL4 has slot of soluble gas in the oil
1655 2018-12-13 20:59:19 ...and that #Beto still has that pesky industry PAC monies addiction he seems to be struggling with ..goes w/o mention. Oil lobby,,,isn't it?
1656 2018-12-13 20:59:13 If the Maritimes were to be supplied with Canadian oil, they would buy from the Hibernia field, not Alberta. Instead. Newfoundland's production is purchased by American refineries. Energy East is and was an uneconomic pipe dream.
1657 2018-12-13 20:59:10 They tried to finesse me by saying my brakes had less padding left than what’s actually there. And then charged $60 just for a damn oil change
1658 2018-12-13 20:59:03 Wow, that most have been a smocking deal!! We all see thru ur BS! Got any snake oil?
1659 2018-12-13 20:58:55 How pray tell is @jkenney going to change the price of oil priducts?
1660 2018-12-13 20:58:49 Sorry I don’t have better news on this. I know some people who’ve tried steroid creams/bio oil/other prescribed by GP to help with the itch.
1661 2018-12-13 20:58:47 Now, I Maki
Chicken thighs, peas, potato sauté in coconut oil with garlic salt pepper. No burrito
1662 2018-12-13 20:58:35 Got it. That's a plausible argument, but I haven't seen a comprehensive analysis of it. The palm oils/biofuels example is a clear case where it would reduce GHGs and do other good things to move away from palm oil to electric vehicles, but more research is needed.
1663 2018-12-13 20:58:33 $UWT oil isn't done yet
1664 2018-12-13 20:58:30 For sure, but just roasting sprouts with olive oil, salt and pepper is very good.

1668 2018-12-13 20:57:54 And it was great meeting Fernandina Beach Mayor John Miller, soon off to join Oceana’s fight to protect the shores from Trump’s irresponsible and illegal oil and gas exploration moves. Appreciated the drinks and welcome to Amelia Island!
1669 2018-12-13 20:57:53 @975TheFanatic uhh isn’t oil an essential ingredient IN mayo? what’s the diff?
1670 2018-12-13 20:57:22 @TyJohnsonNews @NatalieEgenolf Im not an oil/vinegar person....Mayo only
1671 2018-12-13 20:57:21 That's wonderful I agree, I don't want us to replicate Venezuela either, an autocratic, anti-democratic,corrupt country whose leader has filled his cabinet with unqualified family members and friends, who can't move on from oil. I agree we shouldn't want to replicate that.

1676 2018-12-13 20:57:00 The oil warning light may come on for a few different reasons, which include low oil pressure or a low oil level.  If your oil light comes on while you are driving down the road, the first thing you should do is safely pull over and turn off the vehicle.
1677 2018-12-13 20:56:57 I sell beard oil... And I want to give out 2 ,am interested guy should DM me.

1682 2018-12-13 20:56:18 .@realDonaldTrump is basically arguing that by adding some elements of TPP into NAFTA(and then rebranding), somehow Mexico is paying for the wall.

Waiting to see if @AnnCoulter and @IngrahamAngle buy that snake oil.
1683 2018-12-13 20:56:12 Commodities: #Rubber +8.42%, #Gasoline 4.70%
Top commodity gainers are Rubber (8.42%), Uranium (3.48%), #Crude Oil +3.56%, #Naturalgas (3.34%) and #Steel (2.48%). Biggest losers are #Sugar (-1.96%), #Oat (-1.50%) and #Coffee (-1.23%).
1684 2018-12-13 20:56:03 Sprinkle them with sugar and salt, then glaze them in a saucepan over medium heat with a little chicken or beef stock and butter (or olive oil if the lactose intolerance is severe).
1685 2018-12-13 20:55:55 That's really just a suggestion of when you should get your oil changed. Most cars are fine changing it after 5000-7000.
1686 2018-12-13 20:55:55 Sounds like Mr Hammond is advocating a Purge of those who do not toe the party line!How very ministerial of him. A Coward. A Chancer. A Loser. A Weasel. A Snake Oil Salesman. A Man not worthy of his Office. This Chancellor has NO redeemable features to speak of.
1687 2018-12-13 20:55:33 and weed a oil
1688 2018-12-13 20:55:33 Is that how much money you are losing on oil or is it how much money you are losing to Quebec
1689 2018-12-13 20:55:23 Oil corps are going to seek financial perks for funding green projects and this should not happen. It’s like paying your kid for doing what is expected of them. Oh you brushed you’re teeth. Here have a dollar. 

No brush your damn teeth so they don’t fall out that’s you reward!
1690 2018-12-13 20:55:19 Only two hours 
1691 2018-12-13 20:55:13 What if oil companies find great green innovations? They are doing billions of dollars of research on renewables. Is that bad?
1692 2018-12-13 20:55:10 This one I just cooked in coconut oil and used Himalayan salt. The salmon was seasoned enough to the point where I didn't wanna have it too overseasoned

1694 2018-12-13 20:55:08 I swear I can never get proper sleep
1695 2018-12-13 20:55:04 They are trying to protect their budget deficit which is set to explode again as oil prices fade.

1699 2018-12-13 20:54:28 Throw some cut up brussel sprouts in a frying pan and Cook Em up  with olive oil salt / pepper you will see the truth.. they are legit
1700 2018-12-13 20:54:25 I recommend Marula oil this winter season
1701 2018-12-13 20:54:23 Fear not loins of @Kappa_Kappa, I use a combo of beard balm and argan dry oil for irritation minimization.
1702 2018-12-13 20:54:22 No puede ser?????? Una amiga de otra clase me dejó un essentail oil calmante como regalito en mi mochila y lo acabo de encontrar???? LLORANDO GRASA. NO ME DI CUENTA.
1703 2018-12-13 20:54:06 Chop ten ounces of olive oil and whisk briskly.
1704 2018-12-13 20:54:06 Probably using too much oil, you don't need much. 

Like straight after you wash towel dry place about half a tea spoon of oil in your hand, rub your hands together and apply to the bottom 3/4 of your hair. Your routes don't need it. Then blow dry. Comb through when dry.

1706 2018-12-13 20:54:04 10 years ago the US averaged importing 11.1 million barrels of oil a day. Now we import on average only 3.1 MB/d. We now also export oil. The US, Russia and Saudi Arabia now produce 40% of the world's oil supply.
1707 2018-12-13 20:53:59 “Feeling sick? Take a load of this thrives oil”
1708 2018-12-13 20:53:57 Just paid $300 to have my oil line fixed in my car, now it's not shifting. I cant get ahead
1709 2018-12-13 20:53:52 Another angle is that all nations have to adopt low carbon technology if we are to hit our carbon emission goals, no matter what their ideology is. Saudi Arabia's main export is oil, so it's a big deal if they want to adopt electric racing.
1710 2018-12-13 20:53:46 historically, pre-Hoyrood Parliament, Scotland was definitely cowed into being a battered spouse because we had no real way to combat the abuse (sale of licences for oil in Scottish waters to private enterprise so that Scotland did not benefit directly is a key example).
1711 2018-12-13 20:53:34 @BP_America Remember that time you spilled all that fucking oil all over the Gulf? #pepperidgefarmremembers
1712 2018-12-13 20:53:32 Just like Marlboro getting into the Cannabis Industry. It's not fair. 

Oil Barons get to hide climate change reports for 40+years destroying the world and then get to become green energy barons? Nope. Time for new companies to rise up and be helped. Fck Exxon and the likes.

1715 2018-12-13 20:53:04 You believe the lies of millionaires billionaires and big business, the magic bean and snake oil salesman love a mind like yours. 
PS. As the son of a miner who knew in 1981 it was the unions that fucked the miners.

1716 2018-12-13 20:53:02 Different question. @robotbeat is arguing that #electrifyeverything can solve climate change, including all GHGs, including land use change. I'm pushing back on that, not supporting biofuels or palm oil.

KL3 (KL4s little brother)

From RNS 11/2018.

Â· KL3 produced at an initial metered sustained natural flow rate of 771 barrels of oil per day ("bopd"), with a maximum recorded half hourly rate of 902 bopd. 

Wait to KL4 comes off pump.
1718 2018-12-13 20:52:57 Elections in this country have been engineered along tribal lines..with recent corruption reports and politicians pushing to have their tribal supporters head corruption ridden institutions..whose corruption proceeds used to oil the campyn trail this narrative takes a nasty head.
1719 2018-12-13 20:52:50 I'm so pleased it wasn't just me
1720 2018-12-13 20:52:50 Mexico has oil... Venezuela has lots of oil..  Both mentioned nations are socialist, despotic, corrupt thiefdoms.  Bottom line is you could give Mexico back Texas and the Mexican government would mismanage it into poverty.
1721 2018-12-13 20:52:50 There aren’t. Unless they have oil or other natural resources to sell to China, or are a City state like Singapore. The one exception is Switzerland, which applies many of the EU laws (and is also a small grouping of small cities, funded by private banking/finance).
1722 2018-12-13 20:52:42 Palm oil. It's a cancer
1723 2018-12-13 20:52:41 the scent of sesame oil is an aphrodisiac

1725 2018-12-13 20:52:19 $cei  ATTENTION ALL ))SMART KIDS(((   PAY ATTENTION TO OIL PRICES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1726 2018-12-13 20:52:15 It’s not so much a refusal to integrate....it’s more that oil and water don’t mix, and also that birds of a feather flock together
1727 2018-12-13 20:52:11 Spike oil, Dow up to close spx flat. Game on
1728 2018-12-13 20:52:11 The US has a massive amount of oil production compared to 6 or 7 years ago. Not as many barrels per day of oil imports are needed as long as the shale oil bubble still lives on credit
1729 2018-12-13 20:52:05 Spot on. The plantation owner became the coal baron became the oil baron. The chain must be broken, otherwise the worker and the common citizen will be subjected to the same oppression and exploitation as always.
1730 2018-12-13 20:51:47 I remember when I was a lad back in the mid 1970s my dad had a Fiat 850 two door , it was noisy and died on Canwick Hill in Lincoln, in a cloud of smoke and oil on the road as it struggled up the hill ! 
1731 2018-12-13 20:51:47 That's all of Canada, not just Alberta.  
Also includes natural gas & electricity not currently impacted by oil glut, politics of Trump, MSB and Putin, fact refiners like Suncor are happy while smaller Cenovus O&G are crying.etc
Complicated pic simplified by Kenney Con politics.
1732 2018-12-13 20:51:43 Oh no well caster oil is really good too
1733 2018-12-13 20:51:39 Ok, so if we have a problem with climate change what is the plan besides taxing people?  A sin tax on carbon will not help climate change, it doesn’t stop people from smoking either.  We have no viable alternative to oil so how will taxes help?
1734 2018-12-13 20:51:37 My poor car is finally getting an oil change & a good wash she deserves to be spoiled too
1735 2018-12-13 20:51:28 do yall shampoo condition or oil your pubic hairs?.... if they are coarse hairs you should consider it. also exfoliate. thank me later.
1736 2018-12-13 20:51:12 He's no oil painting is he 
1737 2018-12-13 20:51:09 COCONUT OIL. It’ll help moisturize your hair and make it all shiny. You can also do a deep conditioning mask two/three times a week. My hair was super damaged from bleaching/dying it a bunch and both of those helped significantly.
1738 2018-12-13 20:51:09 $PDS oil up.. wtf
1739 2018-12-13 20:51:04 I’m Albertan and I’m frustrated as hell that the province hasn’t really tried to diversify its economy so that recessions don’t affect it as hard. I mean, the NDP are trying but they’re getting a lot of resistance. Apparently the only thing that matters is wheat/oil 
1740 2018-12-13 20:51:01 Get some beard oil and shower gel. Best stuff at M&s
1741 2018-12-13 20:50:42 And the Oil Giants do have their plans for transitioning to clean energy.
1742 2018-12-13 20:50:40 No. This is about deferring debt created by a tax break like the one Trump signed.
He can pretend that it's about oil consumption but, it's about recouping the losses associated w/a tax break to people that didn't need one and laying it on the people who already pay their share.

1746 2018-12-13 20:50:21 Except the price of oil affects my husbands high achieving job.

1751 2018-12-13 20:49:46 They are terrible about this. I had the same problem twice.  Can’t get an oil changed in a timely manner, ac went out and they told me two weeks at dealership. I won’t even go to there service bays, and I get $10 oil changed if I do, I’d rather just spend 40.
1752 2018-12-13 20:49:45 Sorry sold out of my cbd oil took the fuckin lot so I can hopefully relax more in the second half
1753 2018-12-13 20:49:44 But anyways my mom was really mad today cuz I “didn’t” bring my hair oil but truthfully I just didn’t want her going through my stuff cuzzzz y’all know......
1754 2018-12-13 20:49:32 I heard that Soros receives taxpayer money. Russia pays for environmental groups to damage our oil and gas industry - we’re Russia’s competitor. The Sierra Club succeeded in stopping fracking in New York. I never imagined Russia was behind it.
1755 2018-12-13 20:49:30 Exactly right. Our moms boiled brussel sprouts, those little round potatoes and even ribs. They all taste awful that way. Brussel sprouts with olive oil, sea salt & fresh ground pepper are awesome. Bacon and brown sugar even better.
1756 2018-12-13 20:49:27 There are many energy export dependent nations like the Gulf, Norway, Russia. And they all tried to diversify. Not these idiots. For years 90% of their income was from oil. Even record price wasn't hiding the looming crisis. Oil got cheaper and they caved. Everyone saw it coming.

1758 2018-12-13 20:48:42 It would seem that if fossil fuel interests default on their debts, everything else defaults, too. But then, perhaps the banks haven't quite figured that out yet. Or they have, and are scared as shitless about losing money & power as the oil barons...
1759 2018-12-13 20:48:32 hidden?!?  seriously???
if you think the beneficiaries were hidden, you've not been paying attention.  

"But it turns out that there was a hidden beneficiary of the plan that was pushing for the changes all along: the nation’s oil industry."

But keep licking the boot of ur master and feel comforted by the warm nationalism they've shoved down ur throat
1762 2018-12-13 20:48:08 Who changes the oil on the Batmobile?
1763 2018-12-13 20:48:02 'Oil and gas giants paid $946m in Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, up from $845m  the previous year, but down from $1.8 billion in 2013-14 after losses and investments were carried forward. The figure is still a fraction of the $26.6 billion earned by Qatar via its royalty scheme'
1764 2018-12-13 20:48:01 Plastic is made from oil

Chickens are dinosaurs
Therefore plastic tastes like chicken
1765 2018-12-13 20:47:47 Andrew I have two questions that you wont answer I bet you run away.
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of our oil revenues or the 8% we get now?

2)Do you think the half of scottish voters are wrong to want to run thier own country?
1766 2018-12-13 20:47:44 When OPEC pins  The price of oil to the ruble, and we return to nine dollar gallons of gas; we can remember how important Khashoggi was to all our lives.
1767 2018-12-13 20:47:24 Sorry Stacey, your essential oil diffuser isn’t gonna help the fact that you downed 10 shots of fireball last night.
1768 2018-12-13 20:47:17 Lightly salt and drizzle olive oil (spray works) on kale. Roast 350* for 30 minutes. Crispy treat!
1769 2018-12-13 20:47:14 I need an oil change but it’s going to have to wait until the weekend 
1770 2018-12-13 20:47:13 U.S.A. the number 1 explorer of oil.
And not mentioned this week, NK and SK making more progress.
1771 2018-12-13 20:47:12 Palm oil is bad: Bad for people when they eat it, bad for the environment when converted to biodiesel, and bad for orangutans and other cool critters. Do you need to know more than that?
1772 2018-12-13 20:46:58 Lies. That's my role.
1773 2018-12-13 20:46:52 We have oil & gas in BC as well and they're not as responsible as they should be I want our products refined in Canada and the export of raw products and our jobs stopped I want a sound responsible development
1774 2018-12-13 20:46:46 I do that with this great wood oil. Pleasant smell too!

What have I done
1776 2018-12-13 20:46:42 Wow I always hate cooking chicken because it’s gross/I always over cook it but I just used my instant pot and wow it was so easy! I also feel like it’s healthier since you don’t use oil at all! Call me chef Sarah from now on hahaha
1777 2018-12-13 20:46:39 Try Either beard oil- yes it’s a thing or buy a slip ends conditioning mask from clicks. Men have said the Monoi brand works well 
1778 2018-12-13 20:46:39 When your company announces that they will be launching a 100% pure hemp derived liposomal CBD oil (with exclusive rights) the same week the Farm Bill passes legalizing the production and sale of Hemp at the federal level!

The future is bright!

1779 2018-12-13 20:46:37 Fools regurgitating a narrative drilled relentlessly into their lazy and gullible heads by oil tycoons. If they had any wit whatsoever, they would do a little research and realize how brainwashed they really are. If they care about future generations, it’s the min they can do.
1780 2018-12-13 20:46:28 I call bullshit on these numbers,, where are these jobs, what is the salary, are they as high paying as oil workers,,  I think not,,  minimum wage jobs are not jobs
1781 2018-12-13 20:46:27 Thanks to the oil money...
1782 2018-12-13 20:46:25 Use a oil on your hands while taking out any style to reduce frizz
1783 2018-12-13 20:46:22 More profit for investors, not the workers left out of jobs because a pipeline rendered them obsolete. Again, this is automation. Like how self checkouts left many cashiers on EI. Again, pipelines don't benefit you unless you have significant stock investments in oil already.
1784 2018-12-13 20:46:04  anyone like the smell of a fresh oil change?
1785 2018-12-13 20:46:03 Now this will take oil back to 60

1794 2018-12-13 20:45:17 Grab some heat spray and hair dryer, after washing oil it,  that might help. But I'm paranoid about losing my hair so it's the one thing that destroys my bank balance  but your hair looks nice and thick and healthy  oil, heat spray and blow dry would be all id advise x
1795 2018-12-13 20:45:13 I'm not understanding why this is newsworthy? This isn't normal behavior? What's tomorrow's headline, BREAKING NEWS!! A Toddler From Kansas Ties His Dad's Shoes Together Then Ask's For A Glass Of Water!! BREAKING NEWS!! Tom Gets His Oil Changed! BREAKING NEWS!!
1796 2018-12-13 20:45:05 @SamanthaCortese What makes peppers & chilies "hot" r mixable w/alcohol & fats (liquour & ice cream, milk, cream). NOT WATER. I think it is called capicin s an oil base. So if ur mouth s hot from them swish mouth wdrinkable alcohol or a fat based item = ice cream, cream, milk.

1803 2018-12-13 20:44:34 Do you think Trump reducing regulations to increase US energy production and pressing OPEC to lower oil prices are how he is paying back Putin for the help in the election?

1810 2018-12-13 20:43:53 Right, "timber"=fast-growing softwoods for pulp and paper, replacing forests. Logging of e.g. dipterocarp hardwoods is a big driver of deforestation in Indonesia too but that'd be a different category of concession.
(NB: "large-scale"=too young to distinguish palm oil or timber)

1819 2018-12-13 20:43:14 Olive oil by itself is dirt. Mix the two it’s amazing.

1821 2018-12-13 20:43:04 Western econ sanctions were negligible (limited to arms sales) until very recently. US was even buying Chavez's oil. Iran sanctions were worse for longer, and yet they didn't collapse.

Chavez bankrupted the country already in 2010. But the oil prices were high so they limped on
1822 2018-12-13 20:43:01 The growth of USA shale oil is the most stupid propaganda. WTI AT $52 a barrel, most shale producers have no positive cash flow, USA is selling its oil below production cost, it is pumping oil by burning OPM ( other people money ).
1823 2018-12-13 20:43:00 How things change. Farm Bill contains provisions for producing hemp and CBD oil. Good for rural SE. Kentucky could be important producer.
1824 2018-12-13 20:42:55 Yes he was and people just dismissed him mostly. He tried to move us away from oil but America said no it was a big mistake then and is now if we don't act
1825 2018-12-13 20:42:27 I took my car to the mechanic for an oil change and to see why my car kept making a funny noise and there was a fucking JACK RABBIT STUCK IN MY CAR LMAO. He survived tho so it’s all good

1829 2018-12-13 20:42:10 2/2 - Check open secrets. Beto takes bribes from Oil/Gas. Kamala has a record of crushing POC with racist legislation, & pay for play w/ Wall St. Biden was in favor of the 94 Crime Bill, repealed Glass Steagall & supported economic policies that brought DT to power. They're bad.
1830 2018-12-13 20:42:04 also: using facial cleanser any more often than once a day will make your skin oilier, as will using oil-free products. rebound oil overproduction is a real pain
1831 2018-12-13 20:42:00 fish oil does wonders brudda
1832 2018-12-13 20:41:54 How does buying foreign oil save the planet? You've been listening to propoganda. Reclamation is done on all finished sites. If we had zero CO2 emmissions that would only reduce 1.58% of CO2 on the planet, which would be made up by countries supplying us while we starve.
1833 2018-12-13 20:41:48 Remember, the emissions are for land use *changes*, ie clearing more forest for cultivation. Even ending the *growth* of Palm Oil for biodiesel could help. But if electrification actually reduces land for palm oil (causes reforestation), it’ll mean effectively negative emissions.
1834 2018-12-13 20:41:17 Lmfao and oil on the floor so he can slip and bust his ass running to the toilet
1835 2018-12-13 20:41:08 After the settlement it won’t be much money for the families suffering. Terrible that we can’t have clean water. I remember when there was an oil spill in the Yellowstone river. Took a summer to clean it up.
1836 2018-12-13 20:40:39 This is America's incessant need for oil... and the profit of a historic arms deal.. to remain silent in the of evil, is to contribute.. there is a special place in hell for that kind

1842 2018-12-13 20:39:47 You have to get them all to shift to renewables simultaneously. I imagine one way to do that is by threatening all their jobs at once. Putting one oil company out business threatens the jobs of all the others.

1844 2018-12-13 20:39:40 CNRL and all Canadian oil companies are doing their part. What are rich jet-setters and aging hippies in @WhistlerBlckcmb doing? 
Paper straws and bamboo utensils won’t do anything. Shutting down your resort will save millions of liters of jet fuel though.
1845 2018-12-13 20:39:22 Dealership tried to charge me 140 for an oil change. I finessed them into giving it for free.
1846 2018-12-13 20:39:22 I’m proud of Barras for representing hardworking people who are overwhelmed with overtaxation since you came into office. The surplus is from taxes and sales tax revenue is down. Lawsuits galore against the oil business. Stop spending money and balance your budget and save it!

1852 2018-12-13 20:39:14 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
1853 2018-12-13 20:39:07 I worked in the oil industry in the 80s when seismic crews were still looking for sweet oil. I went through almost every bust with Conservatives in power & with taxes/royalties much higher. Policies are not to blame for investment fleeing. It always happens with low oil prices.
1854 2018-12-13 20:38:56 Kind of like Jared and trump supporting the prince because of the oil?
1855 2018-12-13 20:38:55 hmm. yes, in that calculation I had assumed 5 gallons of gas weighed 40 lbs (based on my schlepping of waste veggie oil... don't ask), but it weighs only 30. that brings me up to 115 mpg equivalent which is pretty close

1865 2018-12-13 20:37:46 oil as behaving mostly technical. i already given 48 hours 53+ even hand write it 24 hours ago.. am i not. it is very technical. look graphs i share. technical is not god words but it is obeying technical. short it... but ready for 55. short it accorddingly
1866 2018-12-13 20:37:38 No. Oil companies control a few men. Even if a CEO chose to shift to renewables, he would have to convince all of his VPs, and they would have to convince all of their underlings, and so on. But employees just want to put in their 8 hours, and go home.
1867 2018-12-13 20:37:38 You know what? Whistler should ban cars and buses.

1876 2018-12-13 20:36:48 Oooh, I haven't taken it in yet. I just mean that I was impressed the guesses were mostly in that lower bracket. My car only gets an oil change every 10,000 miles, but that also means just the price of an oil change for the full synthetic stuff is kind of high

1897 2018-12-13 20:34:58 Example 2: if a corporation, say, spills oil into the ocean the corporation is liable for financial damages, but the state now has greater power to go after persons or parties responsible for the negligence or malfeasance that caused the ecological disaster.
1898 2018-12-13 20:34:44 Oil hasn't been behaving to the technicals much these days.
1899 2018-12-13 20:34:28 I can see me now. In my nicely decorated, Holy Spirit filled apartment, with 10,000 candles & oil lamps, with my two pups (1 yorkie & 1 Maltese), 100 blankets, and comfy nightgowns & robes. The good life.

1904 2018-12-13 20:33:34 Aww, ty, sib!! I’m happy with it but know it could be better. Which oil serum do you use? I’d love to add either an serum or essence to my routine
1905 2018-12-13 20:33:23 Plus, ROLL BACK EVERYTHING TEEN MAGAZINE TAUGHT YOU ABOUT OIL IN THE 90s.

1912 2018-12-13 20:32:37 I let my sister borrow my car ONE time, for 45min. I get my car back...... now I need a wheel alignment, oil change, and new breaks.  I SWEAR it be yo own people!!!  throw the whole car and sister away.
1913 2018-12-13 20:32:36 When did that happen? I thought Premier Notley was responsible for global oil prices and chasing investment away. What the hell is wrong with people today? Investment ALWAYS goes south in an oil bust and that happens every single time!

1915 2018-12-13 20:32:26 That’s just not true. Health care is an inelastic good. I would pay infinitely for meds that would cure cancer for a loved one which is an oversimplification, but the point is you can’t treat health care like oil or consumer goods.

1920 2018-12-13 20:32:15 In Nigeria the derrickhand has to worry about snipers in the River Delta picking him off and there are more security personnel than oil workers.
1921 2018-12-13 20:32:01 Of course it isn't about money. It's just more hollowing out of Alberta. @JustinTrudeau has great disdain for the those dirty oil Provinces.  Anything he can do to subtly - or not so subtly - make the Province less attractive and influential is a good thing. @gmbutts

1924 2018-12-13 20:31:30 Those are all corporate-owned neoliberals. Their platforms will pander to progressives and their policies will benefit their donors: oil & gas industry, military & prison industrial complexes, and Wall Street. Don’t be surprised when independents stay home & trump wins 2nd term.
1925 2018-12-13 20:31:26 All gasoline is tax. As is most things.
Why don't we talk about the EPA turning back gas efficiency requirements at the behest of Marathon Oil? Corruption and Bribery in your country greatly interests me
1926 2018-12-13 20:31:24 Had to bring my car into BMW because I had a recall. Asked them to do an oil change and these fuckers are trying to charge me $280 just for the oil change. I'll just let my whole car blow up at this point.
1927 2018-12-13 20:31:05 So you want oil and gas in your province, just not shipped overseas?

Actually that happened weeks prior.

Not a single MSM journalist has covered the antiquities theft.  

The real reasons for the invasion may be those museums, not oil.

1984 2018-12-13 20:24:27 Maybe they should shutter much of the extreme growth that has taken place over the last 15 years. It's the  best way to keep the nasty oil that built all of this wealth, away from their territory. It would be a great way to do their part.

1986 2018-12-13 20:24:03 I think Saudi Arabia can afford to pay for their own war in Yemen. God knows they have enough money fro oil sales. We can spend our money on a wall to protect ourselves. Time to let other countries pay their own way. If they want war, let them pay for it!

1997 2018-12-13 20:22:54 Of course I wouldn’t!! Which tweet did you actually read? I’d ensure I have all the know how and trained manpower to sustain my country for the day oil dries up. Simply because it won’t be able to keep on paying foreigners to work for them and protect them..

2025 2018-12-13 20:21:10 Youd have no fruit or vegetables or almonds. Most farms are harvested by undocumented. Then there is the oil and gas industry. “Americans” dont want the work. Many of the employers are @gop. Undocumented immigrants are not the problem. They are a symptom.

2029 2018-12-13 20:20:54 That’s just it. It’s not a few men exercising control; it’s a few men representing the interests of a few oil companies. Empowering though it may be, disbanding an oil company is not an exercise of power over people; it is just another way to keep the economy running smoothly.

2034 2018-12-13 20:20:19 Thank you. And nice to meet you as well. My ginger girl is Maria "Atlas" Surikov, my main OC who will be featured in a web comic that I plan on doing in the near future.

Also, I'm also glad you like my oil paintings. I started getting into that when I watched his TV series on...
2035 2018-12-13 20:20:18 Eventually we need to end our dependence on oil. For now its needed but we need to think about the future too. Alberta feels let down because it was always doing excellent. Now it's just average. Think about who has the highest unemployment. It's not Alberta.
2036 2018-12-13 20:20:14 55 ppl died in an oil explosion and niggas come jesus thumping.
2037 2018-12-13 20:20:04 one month of consistently applying castor oil onto my lashes every night and the difference is just BEAUTIFUL
2038 2018-12-13 20:19:28 People with perfect skin be like omg I love rubbing sheer oil all over my face :) lmao #glow
2039 2018-12-13 20:19:22 $USO #Oil going here , about to see major breakout higher near term imo #bullish
2040 2018-12-13 20:19:15 There is a 10 year bumper-to-bumper warranty, but I only bought a 3 year service plan that covered oil changes and most stuff needed for normal wear and tear. Thanks, I’ll check the manual

2042 2018-12-13 20:19:07 He id from "feudal" Saudi Arabia, of course.
They deserve to be invaded and stolen that big amount of oil under their feet.
If they like feudal-like world...
2043 2018-12-13 20:18:56 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2044 2018-12-13 20:18:56 Yes it's great to be a Saudi  prince you can get awaye with murder and every one watch.
The land of the free means that you are free to do any thing as long as oil prices  are down !
2045 2018-12-13 20:18:56 This guy gave me all of his oil paints because he’s not gonna use them :,) I love non-art majors in art classes
2046 2018-12-13 20:18:47 I respectfully disagree due to presence of Frankenfish risks, (by storms, broken cages), antibiotics, GMOs, & lice associated with caged fish fed by chemical companiesUnappetizing

2047 2018-12-13 20:18:39 People w/ oily skin have to get drunk when we go out to get good pics bc dehydration is the only way you’re not gonna look like an oil slick in 2 hrs
2048 2018-12-13 20:18:37 Babe even you in China
2049 2018-12-13 20:18:30 Coconut oil drys out my hair 
2050 2018-12-13 20:18:25 Interesting that their mandate government says Alberta oil is not welcome. But their citizens don’t want to pay carbon tax 
2051 2018-12-13 20:18:18 Ameen Ameen Sir
2052 2018-12-13 20:18:15 Forget just the ones trying to destroy the oil industry... how about the ones giving generously, often indirectly,  to Liberal election coffers? Why do you thing Justin & the gang refused to outlaw such practices?
2053 2018-12-13 20:17:59 Ameen ya Rabbi
2054 2018-12-13 20:17:57 Oh of course I will.  The options are almost limitless.   Most drinks will probably be shit.   The good news is you can make your own drinks very easily.   Coffee, milkshakes, Tea, juices.  All you need is Oil. Either home made or not.
2055 2018-12-13 20:17:53 Which essential oil can I use to get people to leave me tf alone???
2056 2018-12-13 20:17:52 If you want a nice and healthy look use Shea moisture beard collection. Start with the wash first, then you can use the oil to strengthen and straighten then use the balm for styling.
2057 2018-12-13 20:17:39 I will. But I’ve begun to associate Gove with snake oil. Perhaps harshly so.
2058 2018-12-13 20:17:37 Good thing I can chnage my own oil, brakes, tires and don’t have to rely on no one for the little things on my car.
2059 2018-12-13 20:17:35 No need to say thanks
We handle these trolls everyday 
2060 2018-12-13 20:17:34 My bath rituals have never been the same since I started using bath oil
2061 2018-12-13 20:17:20 Also, doesn't the existence of oil heating in New England demonstrate that some people do not react to price signals?
2062 2018-12-13 20:17:18 I feel bad. it’s like when a duck gets all covered in oil
2063 2018-12-13 20:17:17 Chelsea fans have been chanting anti-semetic things since before they even got that oil money. Some things just never change...

2067 2018-12-13 20:16:50 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
2068 2018-12-13 20:16:32 Who handed Iraq over to Iran yesterday? @realdonaldtrump. We have gotten nothing from the Iraqis-- we should have them pay us back with oil.
2069 2018-12-13 20:16:31 It's so silly. Because oil trades in global markets, it's not IMPORTED oil that's the problem, it is oil use itself. We need to get off of oil, period. We had the tech back in 2004 when we wrote "Winning the Oil Endgame" and it will be even easier now.
2070 2018-12-13 20:16:30 How long could you run a car on WD-40 as engine oil?
2071 2018-12-13 20:15:57 It really is. The grandmother dismissed what the mother had said about her allergies cause she thought she was exaggerating and went ahead and spread a bunch of coconut oil on her hair cause it smelled nice (she was allergic to coconut)
2072 2018-12-13 20:15:44 Never once did I call you a name. You can oil through our conversation and see that. You’re blatantly making things up now.
2073 2018-12-13 20:15:36 Clint Eastwood: This generation is full of pussies! What happened to real men? Men who made their living on oil rigs and in mine shafts!

Interviewer: How'd you make your living, Clint?

Clint Eastwood: I pretended to be a cowboy for 50 years
2074 2018-12-13 20:15:28 Yeah I know, prevents people from inhaling shitty essential oil that are really just fragrance though

2077 2018-12-13 20:14:58 We should be concerned about the conditions under which palm oil (and other edible oils) are produced - we need more research on outcomes of various sustainability interventions like @RSPOtweets are for ecosystems and people @emeijaard

2082 2018-12-13 20:14:32 What’s wrong with coconut oil lol
2083 2018-12-13 20:14:30 Have you ever tried vegan brownies? Not bad with the right olive oil!

2086 2018-12-13 20:14:16 Sounds like it's dried out. You gotta keep fringe oiled or it will do that. Give it a good cleaning and oiling. 
Thinking of how you can straighten it ... can you put it between some books or something after you oil it and put some weights on it?
2087 2018-12-13 20:14:00 ZANDALEE (‘91): Nic Cage’s hot house melodramatic 9 1/2 WEEKS, where his tortured, wandering artist cuckolds a Cajun Judge Reinhold via an increasingly lurid series of erotic encounters (cocaine and olive oil make for great lube, it seems). Tennessee Williams wept. I applauded.

2100 2018-12-13 20:12:51 My maid had an email for this petition. She has signed & shared it on Twitter. She is very passionate about the use of palm oil & destruction of the rain forest.
2101 2018-12-13 20:12:47 Haha , I don’t have much tips, just co-washing and coconut oil is a life saver!
2102 2018-12-13 20:12:46 Start with FPS 60 for the 2 first day then FPS 15 & the last 2 days oil, your tan will be such a pretty gold
2103 2018-12-13 20:12:41 that even the Morris guy put his proverbial foot down on and yet it was a close call as it was raining money in NJ on a secured highway and still the BA in land management bureau issues had the five black oil engineering students put it:  I didn't think and yet the MBA gives legi
2104 2018-12-13 20:12:39 A lot of people care about things like the environment, there was a tanker spill in Alaska I just learned about and still 20+ years later there is still oil on the coastline. I think if people are presented with reclamation strategies they could have a more positive outlook
2105 2018-12-13 20:12:34 Oil dey my head
2106 2018-12-13 20:12:26 Quebec says Ours is dirty but Saudi oil is clean and ethical.
2107 2018-12-13 20:12:19 Oshe! Oil palm plantation
2108 2018-12-13 20:12:13 quiet as gondoliers,
while I wait all night, for you,
in California,
watching the fox pick off my goldfish
from their sorry, golden state —
and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
2109 2018-12-13 20:11:51 4hrs is very powerful and seeking 53 above... as my prediction. so never turn to sell if you got under 51 buys... just you may hedge here #oott #usıoil #crudeoil #oil
2110 2018-12-13 20:11:48 You are? You just denied that massive infrastructure upgrades, completely rebuilding our power grid, and shifting our economy off of oil would create 25 mil jobs. You clearly have only done around 10 minutes of research. Anyways, it’s not like European countries have these alredy
2111 2018-12-13 20:11:46 We shop regularly in iceland and are so happy that you are going palm oil free our fave has got to be the mince pies we love them every year #yummyxmas #happyrangtang

2116 2018-12-13 20:11:24 Glaringly obvious that big oil wants Tesla to fail. We must not allow their greed to drive the misinformation narrative. A sustainable future for all of humanity is the responsible way forward, and Tesla is paving the way. New companies create new jobs, not old ones! Go, Do!

2134 2018-12-13 20:09:42 I 100% agree, I support both, Legalization and building of pipelines! Being an environmental activist, I care about how and where the pipeline will be built! If its 100% safe, or if any danger happens and there are ways to reclaim oil on the land from a spill, I will be happy
2135 2018-12-13 20:09:03 That's the New World Oil reality. God Bless Texas!
If the Saudis want to fix it so OUR producers get another $10/bbl, We'll happily pay the extra freight

2143 2018-12-13 20:08:19 there has been a year long investigation to prove there is no evidence he collided with Russia and job creation (and the rest of the economy) is at an all time high.  We are reaching the point of being independent of foreign oil and are exporting LNG
2144 2018-12-13 20:08:17 If you went big enough with the oil, that might even be braising.
2145 2018-12-13 20:08:09 Plus dont forget Pence Family Oil

 Issues & Kiel Bros going belly up all those Gas Stations Govt & state connections that left many millions in pollution toxic  clean up problems
Are still a mess and interesting Political machinations 
Pence has 3 Bros & 2 Sisters
2146 2018-12-13 20:07:50 ...all these procedures have NOTHING to do with Oil ( that's a separate income being stored for the futuer). These countries owe you or anyone else NOTHING!! They always pick up their own tabs.
2147 2018-12-13 20:07:47 yoos, this was only my 3rd oil change since I bought the car last year in May
2148 2018-12-13 20:07:43 He’s so stupid
2149 2018-12-13 20:07:40 Rumor is the Saudis invaded Yemen for more oil supply. Saudis are doing immense damage to their producing oil wells just to maintain current production. A lot of trusted sources in the oil industry tell me the Saudis flood their wells massive amounts of water injection
2150 2018-12-13 20:07:33 Not sure if you understand what is happening in Venezuela or you’re a psychic. 1. Nigeria is has diversified from crude oil while 95% of Venezuela’s revenue is oil. 2. Nig inflation rate in in 2 digits while Venezuela is experiencing hyperinflation.
2151 2018-12-13 20:07:31  nna i  forget cooking oil maloba kefa ke apeile ka margarine,  reka lapa.

#PalmOilChristmas #Win
2155 2018-12-13 20:06:48 You're promoting the false dichotomy that Canada's fossil fuels industry has been shoving down our throats for years. We are not forced to choose between oil-by-rail and pipelines. There is a 3d option: leave the oil in the ground and convert to renewable energy ASAP.
#climate
2156 2018-12-13 20:06:38 Bc oil kyun pi raha h marega kya
2157 2018-12-13 20:06:32 To be fair, today is the first up day for oil in six months so our sample size is small
2158 2018-12-13 20:06:29 Olive oil gotta be a top 5 creation
2159 2018-12-13 20:06:25 Really bought into your No Palm Oil ad - changed my shopping habits to spend £ at Iceland, then saw you sell eggs from caged hens - birds which are basically tortured. This is incongruous with your animal plight ad & I feel duped. What is your policy on animal welfare, please?
2160 2018-12-13 20:06:23 does not change the underlying crime... and you know it... you're selling snake oil to the congregation
2161 2018-12-13 20:06:18 I just bought a rubber duck....and some baby oil. 

Shit's about to get weird. 
2162 2018-12-13 20:06:12 next time Young Miami on an interview I hope mfs ask her if her pussy taste like motor oil since she don’t drink water... & see if y’all like that 
2163 2018-12-13 20:06:11 I will say that he is dead on what he says about the US. Trump is trying to get coal to make a come back and is devastating our National lands in order to put oil rigs and fracking companies in order to use all of the natural resources.
2164 2018-12-13 20:06:10 Perfect weather to change my oil and brakes 
2165 2018-12-13 20:06:04 Corn Syrup Solids & Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, the two main ingredients, are like crack. Taste great, is addictive, and you never stop wanting it. It also leads to heart disease, inflammation, immune issues...etc. etc. But hey, this is America! If you love it, do it up!
2166 2018-12-13 20:06:01 No. I wouldn’t pay $100 dollars for an oil change if my car was about to blow up
2167 2018-12-13 20:06:01 CBD oil? nah son, TnE oil

. . . i'll see myself out
2168 2018-12-13 20:05:27 The EU operate like a Mafia Cartel, or an Oil Cartel. They are in a position of power, they don't have to listen unless they are forced to listen by the dismanteling of their seat of power. You neither have the grasp of nor skill for the diplomacy required.
2169 2018-12-13 20:05:24 Oh. And I took my fish oil, Vitamin D and Magnesium today.
2170 2018-12-13 20:05:21 Modi: Global crude oil is down because of me.
People: Reduce the price in India and talk

CBN: COng won in 3 states because of my guidance
People: You guide yourself in Telangana first
2171 2018-12-13 20:05:18 Spar Montagu today had boxes of Pure Drop cooking oil bt not selling to e public, bt packing into hampers for a favoured customer. Citizens must reject such nonsense. After they refused to sell l took 1 from a hamper and only then did they sell. Say No to this corruption by Spar!
2172 2018-12-13 20:05:09 Put some teetree oil on my chest. It works, but man the cough just burns.
2173 2018-12-13 20:05:05 @TeamCavuto Saudia Arabia is not punishing Trump with higher oil prices they are reacting to what the US Senate is doing re Yemen. We can see right through Neil's BS.
2174 2018-12-13 20:05:05 He’s got even less oil in his lamp than that charlatan Carney. Standard tosh from DoommongersRUs....

2176 2018-12-13 20:05:03 I've been thinking this about $CRC. It trades down with either stocks or oil, but up with neither.
2177 2018-12-13 20:05:03 You won't believe me but I use it to cook instead of using oil 
2178 2018-12-13 20:05:03 Cooking is not my calling. I fried yam and egg the other day and I felt I was ready to start a 5-star restaurant.

Now I can't even cook noodles. Too much water, then too much oil, later got burnt.

Did I need to buy smash ultimate? No, but I really wanted it.
Did I need to eat so much?
No but I’m always hungry.
Do I need to get an oil change?
Yes, but I can barely afford it because of... previously mentioned purchases
2181 2018-12-13 20:04:24 Make a mask with baking soda &Coconut oil & wash it off . Then shea butter & tea tree oil as just a moisturizer . Works for me
2182 2018-12-13 20:04:23 There are plenty more people that could have been mentioned. I have most respect for the things Rick did to get the message across but when it comes to cannabis oil and healing people with cannabis oil - in my mind and heart, top place is reserved for @JindrichBayer

2187 2018-12-13 20:03:51 30% of what? I don’t see where that figure comes from. Venezuela certainly had a socialist oil industry though, for example.

2193 2018-12-13 20:02:59 This is the only time in the history of Nigeria a non oil revenues compete with oil ....,this the first in Nigeria we knw what's budget padding and state bail out to Cushing the effect of irresponsible leadership by the privilege few..

If their father had given enough respect to their moms, probably they would have been raised to become better persons. Feeling sorry for them
2197 2018-12-13 20:02:35 And that's it for me! Thanks to the powers that be for lettin' me share my day at @theAGU #AGU18

If you're psyched about climate accountability, you can find me tweeting into the abyss at @UCSOrtal the other 364 days of the year. Come on over and take on Big Oil with us

2201 2018-12-13 20:02:27 sadly some alcohol does involve using animals in its production including blood & bone marrow, casein, chitin, egg albumen, fish oil, gelatin & isinglass. so vegans do have to be careful which beers/wines they buy.

2216 2018-12-13 20:00:27 It tastes like you did a beef stir fry in my view. 
Sesame oil is so so nice with veggies btw. Careful about the salt, you may want to reduce the soy sauce. Half tea cup of water may seem alot if you want you can reduce that to quarter as well, up to you. Try sugar snaps!
2217 2018-12-13 20:00:20 Sorry but you’re wrong . Margaret thatcher created the benefits culture when millions were unemployed in her reign. Funded by the  revenues from North Sea Oil this is a fact. Generations not in work created the culture not labour

2231 2018-12-13 19:58:56 Why do people tell me that an oil change only costs $30? What magical cars do you drive that it only costs $30? And why am I shocked every time it's double that?

So now you know why I walked into work chanting "SEC! SEC!"
2237 2018-12-13 19:58:09 You’ve mixed up name under @jamesagannon and @jimmerz50 . Buying an EV was the best thing we did as a family this year. Heat Pump is next to replace coal stove and old oil boiler. Grant eligibility requirements out of reach though for our 1920’s home. Can this be relaxed?
2238 2018-12-13 19:58:06 Valid question- who are the customers expressing interest in Cdn oil & gas if it makes it to tidewater?  Would it not be extremely beneficial to the cause if prospective sales are recognized & publicized? It's like dragons den 101. Who's stepping up to buy product?

2241 2018-12-13 19:57:00 Lol. So everything I said was incorrect by way of arguing what one CEO is saying about corporate action to the current environment, of which government policy is part of that? All because its inconvenient to admit he's anti oil and gas I guess.
2242 2018-12-13 19:56:54 Why the pix. Its oil mill market and not instagram.
2243 2018-12-13 19:56:44 "Small fish and big fish should be fried in the same oil.."just like Kiraitu said.We can't wait to see this happening....#NewsGang
2244 2018-12-13 19:56:38 Lmao it would be if that were the case.

Giant corporations (big oil subsidies, Walmart workers paid so little they have to be on food stamps, Amazon and Apple paying zero in taxes) get massive government hand outs and recieve little or no scrutiny. Pretty simple, idiot.

Why now?
2265 2018-12-13 19:54:28 You heat sesame oil (or corn oil). Then starting with frenchbeans or hardest veggies you stir fry, keep adding veggies till you reach the softer ones eg zuchini or broccoli then add tofu (drain it) then keep adding till Chinese cabbage. Last thing to add is cornflour mix. Voila!
2266 2018-12-13 19:54:24 Wow this is so beautiful I never tried oil painting but I heard its hard is it ?
2267 2018-12-13 19:54:13 I have since taken to using hand refined cold pressed walnut oil both as a medium and to make oil colours which seems to solve the yellowing issue - but I have a load of hand refined linseed oil that I’m unsure how to refine further

2274 2018-12-13 19:53:11 So, we should continue to prop of industries that are destroying our planet? We shouldn't care about thr people they affect?

The layoffs have little to do with this pipeline. Our oil is expensive to extract, companies are automating, and oil is selling at a very lower price.
2275 2018-12-13 19:53:06 i got fucking splashed with boiling oil at work and im gonna scream. if it was any hotter my skin would be gone
2276 2018-12-13 19:53:02 Iono bout all that but when that Spivey shit come up out the oil it be a rocket lol
2277 2018-12-13 19:53:01 It's actually of a very good quality. As to whether it tastes 'authentic', I think it depends a bit on the chippy you're used to. I like it, but it doesn't quite taste like what I think of as an English Chippy. Don't know if it's the oil? The batter? The potato? It's good though.

2282 2018-12-13 19:52:07 Oh that’s cute, you do know that most oilsands are not  affected by the oil price differential?
2283 2018-12-13 19:52:01 Oil prices and ironically, interest rates. B2B does a lot of 60-90 day invoicing. So with higher rates, they have to price that in, meaning firms see higher costs. Add in higher energy costs and end prices naturally go up.
2284 2018-12-13 19:52:01 They want to separate from Canada because their oil and gas industry is busting and they think they pay too much for the rest of Canada

Most of the time, the protagonist appeared to be singing. I recall these things being popular when I was a child. I think they’re called music videos?
2287 2018-12-13 19:51:23 Alberta you want to seperate? No problem there is the door.

Just so you know though.

-You still owe your share of the National debt.

-You lose that Canadian passport

- don't come crying to us in 20 years when the world no longer uses oil and you're completely fucked.

2295 2018-12-13 19:50:38 Dear Micheal, I am interested in the process you use to refine your linseed oil. I have worked with some the methods outlined in Tad Spurgeon’s book but even after refining and allowing the oil to ag3 in sunlight for a year I have had issues with yellowing.
2296 2018-12-13 19:50:37 So let me get something straight $oil went from $78 to $50 and $aal is still  at $32 . I don’t know but it doesn’t add up. By the way that should be accretive to their bottom line
2297 2018-12-13 19:50:35 Foundation Public School owner in Karachi has transferred 450 million.. yes 450 million rupees to accounts in Dubai. You can't make that sort of money having oil wells!!!! The schools ought ought to be made public trusts and made to run by parents councils...

2300 2018-12-13 19:50:17 Like Coconut oil? Lol what kinda oils we talking
2301 2018-12-13 19:50:01 Dollarhide said.

Layoffs generally are expected while an industry is contracting, but the recent cuts have occurred after oil prices surged more than 50 percent over the last half of 2017 and as most energy producers have swung to profitability.
2302 2018-12-13 19:49:51 What's the take home? Should we be worried about palm oil?
2303 2018-12-13 19:49:49 More like keeping a firm grip on Saudi Arabia's oil reserves.  If China gives us any trouble we can turn off the spigot at any time.
2304 2018-12-13 19:49:43 I work at 4 I’m telling myself I have enough time for an oil change and to get my eyebrows done.. I think I can do it
2305 2018-12-13 19:49:34 @HiPPOrganic just purchased some of your product after hearing good things. Gutted to read it contains Palm Oil. First and now last purchase. 
2306 2018-12-13 19:49:29 I would, when you have endless amount of money all investments will succeed, the test is when the oil is dried up. Tourism won’t keep Kuwait afloat. BTW, even the oil is managed by western companies.., even this simple thing They couldn’t achieve.. to my question?
2307 2018-12-13 19:49:26 After trial and error I finally got this oil recipe right 
2308 2018-12-13 19:49:19 I get it, ppl seem hypocritical 4 protesting pipelines while consuming oil. That's part of a wider problem that AB alone can't be blamed for. 

However, as part of the fossil fuel complex, AB is complicit in slowing progress and ensuring that renewable alternatives are available.
2309 2018-12-13 19:49:15 You should eat healthy fats: avocado, olive oil, salmon, nuts... Also do extra virgin olive oil/argan oil masks before washing your hair (it’s THE Mediterranean hair hack) (+ don’t wash your hair everyday)
2310 2018-12-13 19:49:11 #NewsGang:All fish should be fried in the same oil..."remember what Kiraitu said"it should remain..

2313 2018-12-13 19:48:40 Well they saved him from CIA whom he defied & bought cheap oil from the Kurds
2314 2018-12-13 19:48:20 Amin thanks  mungode sosai kaima Allah saka ma da alkairi kayi matukar kokari sosai.
2315 2018-12-13 19:48:08 We’re not the ones being manipulated bruv lol. Look at the countries denying it. Russia, U.S., and Saudia Arabia. The three countries who produce the most oil in the world. Why? Because they want to line their pockets
2316 2018-12-13 19:48:06 He is doing awesome. Has an oil field safety position for an energy Service Company and is making very good money and has really matured as a young man.
2317 2018-12-13 19:48:02 Do you know what causes the formation of OIl and Coal?
2318 2018-12-13 19:48:00 i had a dream my dad confronted me and told me i need to get an oil change

2322 2018-12-13 19:47:45 The cracks have been filled, colored, cleared and polished!!
I wonder if Odie's Oil wax could be applied over a high gloss lacquer finish for a final buff??
2323 2018-12-13 19:47:43 The children’s father offered to come with me first time I check the water, oil and tyre pressure on my new car.  I gave him a  cos wth I did up 2 Mini’s.  Dear Oemfie and Crazy Jacob.  Am I still perceived as helpless?
2324 2018-12-13 19:47:33 Yes, & EPA (Climate change). We must bring back our essential Dept.'s that were taken away. No more Fracking, oil drilling, coal mines. Bring back Honesty, integrity, and HONOR.♡♡♡
2325 2018-12-13 19:47:27 You are missing the point
2326 2018-12-13 19:47:16 Baby we like oil and water
2327 2018-12-13 19:47:13 Keep joking. Nigeria on the verge of recession when we are selling crude oil in a good price. I HAIL OOO. Chief Priest of misinformation. 

P.S: It is during the Economic Meltdown and it affected us, just that we have Sovereign wealth that help us. READ!!!
2328 2018-12-13 19:47:06 So you think it's morally acceptable for Quebec to deny a pipeline through their province because its "dirty oil" yet transfer payments from said oil pays their Bill's? You have a funny way at looking at how this country works. See this is how we should be talking...

2331 2018-12-13 19:46:49 #PureMichiganChat @PureMichigan I don't know how long you can use "unspoiled" in your slogan after Snyder signed a Bill to let  2 damaged, 65 yr. old oil pipelines under the Straits to lay there for 10 more years, while they build bigger pipelines. Shameful.  #ActOnClimate

2335 2018-12-13 19:46:32 They need to rake their forests more often. 

I hate sitting around while the earth sends us critical warning signs all the while big oil continues to pay off the GOP politicians to deny deny deny. If you don’t see the changes in our climate you are either blind or in a bubble
2336 2018-12-13 19:46:32 What do you call a government completing all abandoned projects, paying pensioners owed for decades, assisting states struggling to pay salaries under PDP, paying 30K to Npower volunteers, feeding kids in school, increasing reserve to 44B dollars despite low oil price?
2337 2018-12-13 19:46:31 WE THE PEOPLE are seeing fantastic economic growth in the U.S. because of President Trump!  More jobs, more LEGAL CITIZENS working, & the U.S. is THE LEADING OIL EXPORTER in the WORLD.  WE THE PEOPLE 'DEMAND' BORDER SECURITY!  $5 BILLION TO #FundTheWall OR, SHUT DOWN GOVERNMENT!

2342 2018-12-13 19:46:00 thats the worst :(( castor oil is amazing for your brows & lashes, so you could use that to help them grow back a little faster!
2343 2018-12-13 19:45:59 @RockstarSupport ok so stealing the oil wagon in rdr2 my horse was still over near the refinery. I went into the stable where the drop off destination for the wagon is in order to go ride to get my main horse. now he’s just gone and i can’t find him
2344 2018-12-13 19:45:57 So blessed to have a mechanically inclined bf. Changing out the tranny oil pan & trans fluid for me.  I’m so lucky
2345 2018-12-13 19:45:56 What a liar! Taxes lowered on middle class. Pipeline bought to stave off crisis generating oil revenues. 40 year low in unemployment. AAA rating. 5 new trade deals with 51 countries. Does Andy live in an alternate reality. Does he think Canadians do as well? FYI: we HATE liars.
2346 2018-12-13 19:45:46 If I accidentally put too much olive oil over these veggies before I put them in the oven, did I bake or fry them?
2347 2018-12-13 19:45:39 Imagine a shit kicking rough neck coming home from a long 30 degree day on an oil well, trying to sit through a bad Raw, then seeing the excuse of "it's hard" from those involved. 
2348 2018-12-13 19:45:35 I don't need a counselor I need a proper president not a snake oil salesman that sells myths to the less intelligent and consorts with dictators and praises them when they are barbarians. He is ruthless and he is going down tick tock
2349 2018-12-13 19:45:29 I’ve been so adult today. Went to work, detailed the fuck out of my car, getting my oil changed, and then gonna do some Christmas shopping!
2350 2018-12-13 19:45:26 Can’t argue with that point. He walked right into the fan on that one. Economic policy and politics are to me like oil and water. It’s time to rethink using the IRC as usual. Nothing boils my blood faster than CEOs & their exec teams making millions upon millions.
2351 2018-12-13 19:45:18 Should be decent day for oil stocks tomorrow

2355 2018-12-13 19:44:56 Can you believe some shops charge $200 to change my oil when it only cost $50. Legit it's the same as changing a jap cars oil
2356 2018-12-13 19:44:56 Yeah i know definitely dia re tins to consider. God knows best.

2362 2018-12-13 19:44:16 Your a certified beast. Great picture. Thank you. Lots of bald guys telling me how great the Men’s Face Oil is for their scalp.
2363 2018-12-13 19:44:15 I mean the whole thing is literally a carcass roasted under heat and dunked in boiling oil to scald the skin. But a brain, nah that's 'just disgusting' . Shit like this angers me sometimes.
2364 2018-12-13 19:44:03 100%, but Oilers have a better FF and shot share YTD than Winnipeg and it's QualComp is stronger for Oil, so there is a possibility here.

Also, really what the hell else can you do except have 97 take over like last time.

Also, pray.

2370 2018-12-13 19:43:12 $UCO $UWT long works and so far so good.Will crude oil back to $55?
2371 2018-12-13 19:43:12 Sure, but some scholars says; age doesn't count enough. Intellectual capacity need to be considered as well.  God knows best.

2373 2018-12-13 19:43:11 Hmmm. YouTube seems to think my olive oil video would flow nicely into nick offerman answering wood working questions
2374 2018-12-13 19:43:06 Why didn’t I listen sooner to everyone who said coconut oil was a good moisturizer?? I just got some and I can already feel a difference in my skin. 

I also smell delicious, but that’s another story.
2375 2018-12-13 19:43:06 ...we extrapolate rather than interpolate.

Sone of us have lived through apocalyptic predictions of nuclear holocaust, nuclear winter, ice age, mass starvation, acid rain, silent spring, peak oil, and so on.

Irrational exaggeration only fuels deniers.
2376 2018-12-13 19:42:59 Successfully managed to completely block my left ear trying the ol' olive oil loosener trick. Great.
2377 2018-12-13 19:42:54 coconut oil is good for your hair but not skin! it can clog your pores

2381 2018-12-13 19:42:44 You mean Harper sold much of our sovereignty & oil to the US. Scheer is only good at creating division thru fairy tales & lies. Kenney is a theocrat wanting to turn back time 500 years. Both are funded by US Republican billionaires. There will be no Canada if these goons win.
2382 2018-12-13 19:42:43 @BlakeHackbarth I laughed out loud in the oil change waiting room and a lady looked at me like I’m on crack

2386 2018-12-13 19:42:26 My 87 y/o cancer survivor grandmother has started using CBD oil since it became legal here in OK, and I heard her recently ask my aunt “are you making me take a marihuana?”
2387 2018-12-13 19:42:26 @realDonaldTrump   Hang in there, Sir. We can produce our own oil my friend and gas/fuel. May God bless you and touch your heart. You can do it.
2388 2018-12-13 19:42:20 Talk about being "Stupid", stupid is donating $20 Billion+ year after year to a country that does its best to destroy your industries and tax you into oblivion.  Trudeau's Liberals are purposefully trying to destroy Alberta industries (Oil and Gas, Farming, Beef, etc.).
2389 2018-12-13 19:42:10 Remember when I went to get an oil change with you & it ended up being $600 
2390 2018-12-13 19:42:07 Why is it that most refineries in Canada CANNOT process AB's high-sulfur-containing Bitumen and must import oil from other countries? Actually, most of the oil imported is from the U.S. Who exactly is being disgraceful?
2391 2018-12-13 19:42:06 My mutuals qt things you’re secretly good at: tight rope walking, Middle East peace negotiation, playing the cello underwater, nuclear fusion, oil painting in the dark

2400 2018-12-13 19:41:04 America is the largest exporter of Oil, we don’t need to be bending over backward for Saudi masochists. We can condemn and also be an ally. But after 15 of the 19 terrorists on 9/11 were Saudis, we look like idiots on the world stage.
2401 2018-12-13 19:41:01 I have heard using oils like cantor oil is one, waiting for more tips lol

2410 2018-12-13 19:40:40 Elbi pointed out that if all that stupid nonsense didn't happen for my oil change, I would probably have missed the Aeonaxx mount.

This is true. I need to keep trying to look on the bright side of things.

This made my day :)
2411 2018-12-13 19:40:18 If vegetable oil comes from Vegetable, Groundnut oil from groundnut.. where is baby oil from?

2417 2018-12-13 19:39:12 Hey @scottstp Synthetic oil change for your vehicle was $150, but we gave you a credit on your account for your next visit because we did overcharge you 1L of synthetic oil. The reason for the difference is reg $7 per L , vs $12 per L of synthetic.

2419 2018-12-13 19:39:03 What type of oil did your body reacted to positively?
2420 2018-12-13 19:38:59 As a smart person pointed out, Russians have something to teach us about running national oil and gas companies (e.g. Gazprom and Rosneft).
2421 2018-12-13 19:38:52 Instead of studying for my last final I’ve decided to watch a YouTube video on how olive oil is made
2422 2018-12-13 19:38:52 Lost him to anything that has oil, is soapy and can foam..
2423 2018-12-13 19:38:47 No they're not. They are supplying energy to help people live better lives. Also oil & gas provides feedstock for lots of items that are useful for everyday life.
2424 2018-12-13 19:38:43 $CHK  this should be green news came oil back up
2425 2018-12-13 19:38:42 Cool. Instead of a maple leaf, we could have a salmon, an oil droplet, a grain of wheat, a perogy, and a parka.
2426 2018-12-13 19:38:27 Hey Dianne if you're getting CBD oil I have a local company I use. Ships to your door. Pure isolate. Just CBD isolate and coconut oil. I take it twice a day.

2428 2018-12-13 19:38:14 Or you could put un oil. But then think, shit, we need to go zero, then re think, hydrogen. 
2429 2018-12-13 19:38:01 You are fooling yourself and others if you believe oil will be outlawed. It won’t. But it will be controlled and reduced in its usage. It’s not clothing that’s the problem. It’s vehicle emissions, electricity generation, production itself.
2430 2018-12-13 19:37:38 Hmm. I need to get more leave in conditioner spray, and I have argan oil spray but it's the el cheapo brand so IDK if it's actually eating my hair like the shampoo/conditioner does.

2432 2018-12-13 19:37:28 Stop misrepresenting Equalization and spreading intolerance towards QC. It has nothing to do with pipelines or Alberta oil. If u oppose EQ, you oppose our constitution. If U oppose our constitution, why are you still in Canada?
2433 2018-12-13 19:37:24 hahaha! No need for me to "think" - have you not seen any of the independent Scotland chat??? One of the biggest reasons is because all of our oil money went straight to London - so we did the work, but didn't reap the benefits...
2434 2018-12-13 19:37:24 civics/camrys will out live you and your children and they do their own oil change.

Me, desperately repressing my hetalia phase: oh yeah man that’s nuts
2437 2018-12-13 19:37:07 There's no such thing as clean oil, whether from Alberta or Gulf.
Unless all vehicles are made electric, oil is needed a cross Canada. Shut off valves to Quebec and BC.

2440 2018-12-13 19:36:06 What good will this public condemnation of the prince do?? It will alienate him - whether we like it or not, he controls oil, can give Russia military bases, keeps Iran in check and helps maintain Middle East stability. Isn’t it better to condemn in private? Be practical.

2452 2018-12-13 19:34:38 WE must wean ourselves off petroleum products.  #alternativefuels #sustainability But it's all we've ever known. The world economy is petroleum based.

2466 2018-12-13 19:33:44 Great question, Ben! All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.

2468 2018-12-13 19:33:30 Jonny, have you ever tried CBD oil? Lots of people are having great success with it for anxiety, stress etc, I think IBS is on the list too of benefits! Learning EFT can also really help, it is now clinically proven to help with anxiety, depression and PTSD.
2469 2018-12-13 19:33:30 No one suggested that, and not getting a pipeline isn't suggesting that either. Perhaps if we put the kind if money we put into oil into green technology, we'll get there quicker. Let's be leaders and not stragglers trying to catch up.

2483 2018-12-13 19:32:13 Not really understanding how rich people and politicans can prioritize money/immigration/big oil/etc and not be concerned about climate change whatsoever... None of that shit will matter if the world ends in the next 50 years

2490 2018-12-13 19:31:43 Yeah Oil is supply & demand.  Drops like rock yesterday close.  Today Rips.  Op ex of course coming but this investor supply/demand not physical.

2492 2018-12-13 19:31:41 Nigeria is an oil country like Venezuela, and also has extremely corrupt politicians. Probably lower govt efficiency. Why isnt inflation 12,615% and the economy collapsed?
2493 2018-12-13 19:31:26 We'll see what the market thinks of this. Presumably the market will rally. Can we all agree that whatever that price is will be THE Peak Oil price for the foreseeable future -- barring a nuked Mideast? Brent is currently up all of $0.75/bbl on the news. Coulda/woulda.

2496 2018-12-13 19:31:18 @KrisHolt1 A huge amount of capital has gone into asset-price inflation. At some point that is expected to push out into the liquid realm, and, oil has been a cost-push concern for a long time (Iran, opec, and all that) but the pressure has eased back of late.

2511 2018-12-13 19:29:58 I hate that we are allies with Saudi Arabia.  One of the most oppressive countries in the world.  Oil is one key thing but also military presence in the Middle East is more important. Whether it is right or wrong, the USA must maintain our “Big Stick” status in the world.
2512 2018-12-13 19:29:53 I bathe myself in coconut oil and you out here smelling like shit , fucks wrong with u

2532 2018-12-13 19:28:16 This piece is impressively smug. Barrie - if we had access to markets our oil would have averaged $65/B in 2018 as opposed to $30. The regulatory burden placed on CAD energy (imposed by the feds) is substantially more than any other place on earth. The Feds killed NG. Savvy?

2543 2018-12-13 19:26:52 I’m not an advocate for showering every single day, simply because every other day can be beneficial for your hair & body with secreting natural oils. 

However, I do believe you should at least wash your face daily because if you’re like me, the olive oil is enough to go around
2544 2018-12-13 19:26:49 I know that, but if a pipeline was in place and the gov't put a tariff on SA oil, or charged Carbon tax on it coming across, then it would level the playing field and all of Canada could benefit. Instead, we dither, dick around and do nothing while our own people are out of work

2574 2018-12-13 19:23:30 It was my first time frying something ever and literally the oil was too hot. That’s it lmao

2576 2018-12-13 19:23:19 I believe BTC's properties are similar to the laws of thermodynamics.  Energy into storage of value.

Sun to plants to produce Oil
Two Suns collide to produce Gold
Sun to electricity to mine BTC

Thermodynamics, energy keep the Universe alive.

Sun to BTC to programmable money

2577 2018-12-13 19:23:12 Good question! I wonder if CBD oil shows up on drug test..anyone know?
2578 2018-12-13 19:23:07 LOL another shithouse.
2579 2018-12-13 19:23:04 A good one you realised this Government is working, the statitics @toluogunlesi released on the FIRS in the non oil sector made you conclude Agriculture is the next most profitable sector in the nearest future. I wish you a succesful business. Happy Birthday.
2580 2018-12-13 19:23:03 Nationalization of what? Someone better inform the UK that they are communists since they nationalized their healthcare system. Someone, please inform USA they are commies because passenger rail is nationalized.  Also, Saudi oil is socialist with it ARAMCO national oil.
2581 2018-12-13 19:22:48 If you eat olives as a snack, you’re probably a serial killer. Olive oil is fine.
2582 2018-12-13 19:22:41 Guy , catch your head.
2583 2018-12-13 19:22:37 Because we’re looking backward at how much federal tax we paid during our economic boom and relative prosperity, not at a future without (profitable) oil when we may need equalization payments from the federation?
2584 2018-12-13 19:22:35 “Laced” is a bit of a loaded term in this context isn’t it? Hehe I’m no fan of tobacco (smoked for 20 years) but if they can mass produce and bring prices down so I can get oil carts in a gas station for $5 I’m ok with that!
2585 2018-12-13 19:22:24 And yet he actually thinks he is making a contribution!
2586 2018-12-13 19:22:24 Dope jobs is the tip of leaf, Hemp jobs will more dope, yo. Saffers can grow diesel, and supply world with oil to make bioplastics frmo hemp. A small distiller in every district and Weed Dances instead of Reed Dances. C'mon Health and Agricculture. Shape the policies!
2587 2018-12-13 19:22:07 Newt is as sleazy as Don,
It's no wonder he's been called upon,
They will oil up the place,
With their shared lack of grace,
Finding new ways to lie and to con.

2590 2018-12-13 19:21:59 The only thing I own from her is a lipstick, I have to put so much chapstick & coconut oil on before I use it to make it feel soft on me. I won’t support her besides the fact that she’s an antivaxer the whole Lolita & underage red in the fetish collection not okay!!!
2591 2018-12-13 19:21:54 Get Your Facts Straight.
1) Saddam Hussain gassed entire villages with U.S. approval and U.S. provided chemical weapons.   
2) Bush did not defend the Kurds.  He declared war for one reason only.  Bush defended the oil.
2592 2018-12-13 19:21:41 Now that hemp has finally been legalized, it can be used to replace ALL products previously using big oil. Plastic made from hemp is 100% biodegradable.
2593 2018-12-13 19:21:37 Had a great night in an Aberdeen casino once. It was my friend and I, and then a bunch of oil platform workers. They certainly knew how to live it up.
2594 2018-12-13 19:21:32 Hi JR, we’re sorry you had to wait longer than expected. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.

2596 2018-12-13 19:21:22 I would think that Western Separation would be a great tactic, it has worked for QC for Generations, and still does. I have lived in AB for 15 years and this is the first time that Separation has come up. 

Wouldn't you like to get oil from your own country rather than SA?
2597 2018-12-13 19:21:12 oil license in their backyard
2598 2018-12-13 19:21:00 YEAH AND CHALLAH BREAD HAS EGG WHITES AND OLIVE OIL BUT IT'S STILL BREAD
2599 2018-12-13 19:20:49 The moment you go Ojoh, work and resting under a tree as the sun begins to shine. Under the tree, agai just sting you on your head.... Na so you go dey find oil. I am just remembering those days.. — feeling happy
2600 2018-12-13 19:20:41 Why not when oil is flowing and you have no idea what to do with all the money.
2601 2018-12-13 19:20:24 Yes! Ali Baba had the thieves who put the treasure in the cave visit his home to try to get the treasure back, and they ended up in large jars for some reason, and he had his servants fill the jars with boiling oil. I forget the details.
2602 2018-12-13 19:20:20 This assessment has to be place in context less we forget there was a WORLD RECESSION during the golding administration period. And in the Portia administration oil prices came down to a kool $35 per barrel of oil while the golding era saw oil prices at a whopping $100 n over
2603 2018-12-13 19:20:19 Idk who needs to hear this. But don’t forget to get an oil change.
2604 2018-12-13 19:20:17 nukes, esp. IFRs and SMRs would be ideal to replace coal/nat gas. In addition, geo-thermal would allow the oil/nat gas infrastructure to continue and not fight the switch. But, both sides fight this.
sad.
2605 2018-12-13 19:19:56 telling me I applied oil paint wrong YOU CAN GET SO FAR TO FUCK ITS MY ART
2606 2018-12-13 19:19:47 Nigeria was once the world's largest producer of palm oil. Today, Nigeria is a net importer of palm oil.
2607 2018-12-13 19:19:43 Yah Orin Hatch is the seed of cancer spreading for decades in the party. His is exhibit 1 for everything wrong with white male privilege. He is as much a traitor as a snake oil salesmen the original carpet bagger. Policy will reveal the self servance of the party.
2608 2018-12-13 19:19:41 In a diner, listening to older white men discussing trump wanting to use our wetlands to pump oil and how tragic it would be to our environment and wild life. Also discussing Russian war games 
2609 2018-12-13 19:19:34 omg it was set on high for like 5 min and the second the oil hit the pan, FIREEEEE erupted  wild
2610 2018-12-13 19:19:23 Dude! Do it, but once you're in share the most demonic joke ever. I'm talking trans horse, on a black midget, that involves a jar of crisco that identifies as extra virgin olive oil. Also loved your set here in Kansas City
2611 2018-12-13 19:19:20 Organic unrefined brown sugar. Lemon juice. Extra virgin olive oil. Have been using this homemade scrub for over 3 years. Amazing!! And noticed that I do not have any stretch marks on my body #GirlTalkZa
2612 2018-12-13 19:19:19 I think they all had potential to be the same, but Europeans actually had the means to be worse. Think about the torture devices they invented and the methods of execution, boiling people in oil, burning at the stake, drawing and quartering
2613 2018-12-13 19:19:05 And don't forget HH got dry Oil not full of water like ANGS!!!!
2614 2018-12-13 19:18:56 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
2615 2018-12-13 19:18:53 the real problem is not oil. It is the fact that extremists only push oil/nat gas, while other extremists only push Wind/Solar. The only solution should be all of the above of CLEAN ENERGY. That means Nuke, geo-thermal, hydro, and tidal need to be added.

2616 2018-12-13 19:18:48 What’s an oil burner 
2617 2018-12-13 19:18:45 I never thought in a million yrs that I would be fundraising to buy my Rick Simpson Oil so I can live. I did everything right! I have always ate healthy, worked out for 26 yrs, no smoking & now all I think about is if I have enough money to buy my medicine so I can live.

2621 2018-12-13 19:18:19 I would do anything to be on a beach right now with the sun beating on my whole body and the smell of the coconut oil on my skin with my toes in the sand and the sound of the waves crashing....
2622 2018-12-13 19:18:17 US military financial aid is appreciated and pays back by saving scores of American life, both civilians and military thanks to intel and special ops conducted by Israel against Islamic terror. GDP based on sustainable resources by far ensures lasting growth compared to oil..
2623 2018-12-13 19:18:11 When I find myself in times of trouble...I think back to the time my father in law was talking to my oil diffuser thinking it was my amazon echo 
2624 2018-12-13 19:18:02 I got drunk and completely fucking raged on a canvas the other night. twas a good emotional good time.. only problem.. I used oil paint... everything I own is covered in oil paint now.. even my bag of chips
2625 2018-12-13 19:17:55 this guy just got oil pastel on my pants :(
2626 2018-12-13 19:17:55 But Islam didn't accept it as a norm... Isn't there a clause guiding such.... If it was okay as in not injurious to the society or parties involved. We wouldn't be questioning it ...we would all see it as normal
2627 2018-12-13 19:17:55 This woman is so twisted and warped that I imagine she eats sandpaper and motor oil for dinner. How on earth she lives with her conscience (if she has one) is beyond me. What a terrible person to speak on behalf of the American Presidency. It's shamefuL
2628 2018-12-13 19:17:30 Nothing like spending my morning getting my oil changed and watching Maury in the lobby lol
2629 2018-12-13 19:17:28 I really think you should do some critical reading - at least start with the Labour manifesto, it’s simple enough. As an entrepreneur I would sooner see @jeremycorbyn leading UK than any other Tory snake oil salesperson.
2630 2018-12-13 19:17:18 I know! Absolutely ridiculous
2631 2018-12-13 19:17:15 much-needed grocery shopping! new battery and oil for me car!! more christmas gifts!!! while it sucks when the paycheque doesn't sit long in the account, being able to catch up on the necessities is an underrated good feeling ;;;; and i just can't wait to be a santa to my fam!!!

Why did Trudeau give up Canadian sovereignty by signing the UN #migration pact? 

Why did Trudeau intentionally sabotage Alberta's oil industry?

Why is Trudeau scapegoating licensed Canadian firearm owners?

Why would anyone vote for @JustinTrudeau again?

2637 2018-12-13 19:16:38 I love Houston it’s full of Hustle!!!! Drive in oil changes?!?! Don’t mind if I do!!
2638 2018-12-13 19:16:00 So his corruption extends beyond the oil industry?
2639 2018-12-13 19:15:56 Had to bring my car for an oil change so I brought my mp3 player to listen while I was waiting (I listened to Mouth Moods). Less than 1 minute after the last song ended they told me it was ready.
2640 2018-12-13 19:15:50 stop buying Middle Eastern products they can build solar plants we might buy some of that&oil obsolete leads 2 idiocy.

2643 2018-12-13 19:15:35 @atrembath, @AlexSteffen also explains that a prime reason we missed the ball was because people profiting from the oil and gas industry stalled climate action.
2644 2018-12-13 19:15:28 I hope that’s oil.

2655 2018-12-13 19:13:47 Africa alone? How about next door in Venezuela. They are taking over all the natural resources: Uranium, diamonds, gold, oil...  etc
2656 2018-12-13 19:13:45 To @MFlowersTweetz point, it really isn't covert any more, Big Oil is always the greasy palm shaking hands with environmental negligence. Good article though.
2657 2018-12-13 19:13:42 if one more non-vegan feigns concern to me about the use of palm oil in vegan products i am going to flip a table.
2658 2018-12-13 19:13:37 Just got my oil changed and they said there was no oil on the dipstick when they pulled it 
2659 2018-12-13 19:13:34 Cooking oil
2660 2018-12-13 19:13:28 So I had my gorilla glue cartridge for two days it dropped on the floor and cracked so is it safe for me to dump all of the oil into a blunt and spark that bitch because I’m trying to get high high
2661 2018-12-13 19:13:18 Look up the abiotic origins of oil. Definitely not dead dinosaurs. Most likely a renewable resource produced under intense heat and pressure inside the Earth

And by the way I am not suggesting we continue to use petro fuels, considering suppressed energy technology exists...
2662 2018-12-13 19:13:17 It's likely that the Oil Industry's changes to their fuel formulation in order to improve their profits would be detrimental to the engines the Auto Industry has developed for better fuel economy & emissions. Correcting backwards for regressive fuel formulations would COST THEM.
2663 2018-12-13 19:13:16 We have the tech to transition to a zero carbon country. Insisting we're hypocrites whole ignoring climate disruption is delusional. Check out the carbon bubble. Oil is on the way out and sticking to it is failing our workforce, our country, and our planet.

2668 2018-12-13 19:12:47 You have no idea how much I tell people this, pisses me of when they complain of spots and then I see fucking oil stains on the pillows ya nasstyyy
2669 2018-12-13 19:12:46 At these prices, US production will falter. We will see more bankruptcy’s in the oil patch in coming months. With KSA moving more production to China, it will become another bone of contention.
2670 2018-12-13 19:12:41 Oh its true, just like 'the environment is the foundation of an oil company', or the poor are to loansharks.
They take that foundation,and mutilate it to make a profit, not caring what they leave behind. Its their raw resource to mine and exploit.
That's how they can say it.
2671 2018-12-13 19:12:37 I’m done for day—- it was great. Hope u had a good day too #cl_f #es_f #oil #oott #spy $spy see y’all later, I need food
2672 2018-12-13 19:12:34 Do you think telling voters they cant have:
Higher Minimum wage,
Eliminate Emergency Managers
No bridge
No oil tunnel
Normal? After they told you to do it?
2673 2018-12-13 19:12:30 You speak from a position of hypocrisy - crying foul about the oil industry & #carbon pollution then flying to & from #Europe and polluting the atmosphere with jet fuel exhaust. Hard to respect what you have to say.
2674 2018-12-13 19:12:30 How? The US dollar has value "because the Gov says so" is not "intrinsic" the CHOICE of Saudi Arabia to price oil in USD has moremto do with the "stability" of the $ than any other single factor
2675 2018-12-13 19:12:26 Tides....Fraud committed against Canada by foreign oil companies committed to Canadian oil purchases at huge losses to line their pockets!!!

The real enemies are Gerald Butts and Turdeau and Foreign Funding of election ads.

Ontario Proud is better for anyone not in a union
2676 2018-12-13 19:12:24 because the U,S. now produces MORE oil that Saudi arabia and doesn't need to import as much oil from KSA than they used to
2677 2018-12-13 19:12:16 Ok this sounds good. I’ll look for part 3 of Oil Fall. And that’s lucid re energy production bc efficiency frontier. Obv matters a lot re thinking about how hard is to decarbonize US; IEA accounting makes it look harder
2678 2018-12-13 19:12:11 Heard cbd oil is the shit i wuld take it myself but dont know if it wuld show up as htc in my blood im on dialysis n trying to get a kidney dont need no fuck ups

2680 2018-12-13 19:11:53 oil/fracking ..if sonic boom etc can do that to aircraft even after being modeled for purpose, what chance does Nature have, then think of the New Mexico Desert & US etc Military nuclear bomb trials, thousands of them, any wonder she's melting #motherearth #foodsecurity #suicide?
2681 2018-12-13 19:11:32 @realDonaldTrump is fried.  Time to dip @VP in batter and heat the oil up.

2684 2018-12-13 19:11:20 Anyone in Sac got some black seed oil on deck? Can i pull up for some? Do it for the culture.
2685 2018-12-13 19:11:04 We live in a civilization that's run by fossil fuels. Living our lives while pointing out we need to transition off of oil is what we need to do. Until we get there, we have no choice.
2686 2018-12-13 19:11:01 When you run into the kitchen to get your juice but there’s canola oil on the floor so you slide across, slamming into the oven, completely shattering it all over the place
2687 2018-12-13 19:10:48 I should’ve ate before I came to get my oil changed 
2688 2018-12-13 19:10:44 it looks like an oil painting
2689 2018-12-13 19:10:43 @realDonaldTrump it is bad enough the worlds oil was drained(I hope the middle east lived it up MOTHAFUCKAS) as I worked at a gas station and slaved at gas stations I AM NOT ABOUT TO SEE MY COUNTRY'S OIL DRAINED WHILE I AM HERE
2690 2018-12-13 19:10:39 Trust gearbox to decide it needs a filter and oil change a day before I need to do  a 130 mile journey 
2691 2018-12-13 19:10:37 So through an agent i’ve managed to... acquire the deed to a fairly prosperous oil rig in Mexico. Now that it’s free of my brother’s poor management, I can finally start that oil rig front i’ve always wanted. @Thetruedeus03, send Sanchito out to prospect for me?
2692 2018-12-13 19:10:24 Do u think a country who's annual tourism industry brings in $22billion & its national airline (no.1 worldwide) who's revenue actually funds its GDP & contributes to the countries wealth without oil, wouldn't u agree they are smart?
2693 2018-12-13 19:10:22 1974 Carter + Kissinger + Saudis created the 'Petrodollar' to prop dollar as world reserve currency, buying oil in US Dollars only, partly reason why we went to war in Iraq and Lybia. Get rid of Petrodollar fiat, the Fed, but I don't think you'll go there.
2694 2018-12-13 19:10:17 Whether its legislative repeal of the sickening law allowing drilling in ANWR or the federal courts before or during the application process there will be no oil taken in ANWR
The 1st application is a joke; they cant afford to do a sufficient environmental income statement.

2700 2018-12-13 19:09:33 @jacksoncrompton wouldn’t you prefer to make the money from our oil and gas, using it to fund a program in Canada to research and develop the most advanced alternative energy program in the world?  Seems smarter to me.
2701 2018-12-13 19:09:01 @pepboysauto brought my car in for a 15 minute oil change. Had an appointment at 1pm. Came in at 12:40pm. They quoted 2pm. Came back at 2pm and they hadn’t even started. First and last time being here.
2702 2018-12-13 19:08:51 Lol yeah that’s 4 months  but I color and she gets it retwisted like once a month. I just make sure she oil it and stuff. My hair grows fast too so it might just be that.
2703 2018-12-13 19:08:51 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna

2705 2018-12-13 19:08:37 The Vatican and Rockefeller dropped #FlatEarth from the Bible and replaced it with Round earth in our science books.Our education system is the brainchild of Rockefeller who controlled the oil market on #FlatEarth

2710 2018-12-13 19:08:01 The Oil and Gas Technology Centre has funded over $10 million in innovation projects. See the process in our poster at the World Open Innovation Conference. #WOIC2018 #OpenInnovation @theogtc
2711 2018-12-13 19:07:53 Sometimes it’s really hard to stir and sticks, when I get s spoonful, I just scoop into the dry part and then it has the oil on top and it usually is a fine enough ratio like that
2712 2018-12-13 19:07:43 That morning when the olive oil from the cupboard that backs on the exterior wall looks cloudy & cold. So congealed that it needs to melt on the counter near the stove before it can dribble into the pan for scrambling eggs. #MicroSeasons

2716 2018-12-13 19:07:37 I think the oil embargo of 1973 may have been the culprit, but had other factors not already been in play, or had themselves changed instead of continued being a factor, I don't think we'd see that kink.
2717 2018-12-13 19:07:35 #UKSDA Breaking NEWS, Euro,Central Bank is going 2 slowdown its QE (in other words they R increasing "AUSTERITY". Typical Nonsense from IMF & Partners. It means There will not be enough CURRENCY in all EURO Economies. Currency is oil in an economy engine. UK GET OUT NOW

2719 2018-12-13 19:07:32 Funny that I remember somebody trying to draw a similar comparison between desire and rockhopper......my genuine hope is that both succeed but the reality is as long as ANGS find oil we will all be in clover.....ukog will be fine in the long run.
2720 2018-12-13 19:07:24 So many people selling so many skin glow oil and stuff using their natural heaven factory bodies as advert. Which one is the truth now?

2724 2018-12-13 19:07:11 Got first hand taste of how fake news machinery is working at grass root level. Heard from my in-law who regularly visit local tea shop that @BJP4India has received 1000 crores from oil companies which in turn are keeping oil prices high to make up for the donation.1/2

2729 2018-12-13 19:06:52 What is it with these right wing conservatives that come to Ab from On 
Follow the money money mooonnneeeyyy!!!!  Every province is struggling dipshit! Most only dream of earning the wages once earned in oil. Campers,quads,jacked up pickups. People lack fiscal restraint in Ab.
2730 2018-12-13 19:06:51 And MBS killed an American.  Not getting a lot of outrage from too many folks either.  I don't get it. Not that it's okay, but it used to at least be "somewhat" understandable when the oil was necessary.  Don't even have that excuse any longer.
2731 2018-12-13 19:06:41 Haven't used oil but high cbd weed which was pretty good for anxiety. Had cbd chocolate which was okay but didn't help a huge amount. THC can be a mixed bag for anxiety because of it making some people paranoid but let me know how it goes!
2732 2018-12-13 19:06:36 Have had three good places.

1, Oil resource on hill overlooking The Teapot.
2, Junk resource under the monorail by the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum.
3, Junk resource up the top northwest of the map. 

3 is my current favourite although after the new patch I'll move back to 2.
2733 2018-12-13 19:06:22 Just curious what year you believe global oil consumption will drop drastically?

2737 2018-12-13 19:05:49 They aren't driving the economy now. Tech, oil, banking, & services are. They haven't in a decade, but those jobs will still still be needed for the foreseeable future.
2738 2018-12-13 19:05:49 Silly... OIL will crash
2739 2018-12-13 19:05:42 THERE IS NO MUTATION AT ALL. For 2 centuries antisemitism is against Rothschild Baron's due to their banking, oil and Freemason Empire + Royalty. George Soros is told to be the right-hand of the Rothschild's. Only mutation that he does some good civilian issues with the money.

2745 2018-12-13 19:04:55 Trudea wants to bankrupt all conservatives in Alberta and the West by bankrupting their oil.
Straight out of Obamas playbook. 
Obama democrats helping Trudeau win against progressives enemies in Canada.
2746 2018-12-13 19:04:49 im still so shooketh that the bread i made w coconut yogurt and coconut oil tastes exactly the same as normal bread would like wtf
2747 2018-12-13 19:04:49 Umm... I was alive during his Presidency.. so I remember it well. Should we list all the taxes & regulations had to deal w?.. we can start w pass-thru income and tax rates!.. then med device tax & Obamacare.. then we can move on to manufacturing, gas, oil, farming.. whichever
2748 2018-12-13 19:04:45 Fox tells me Trumps approval rating is 39%. What's up with that people?? What do you want? Higher unemployment, fewer jobs, more regs, more dependence on Arab nations for oil, bad deals with Mexico? Either the facts are misleading or people are nuts.
2749 2018-12-13 19:04:39 maybe she meant like oil for an oil company ;p
2750 2018-12-13 19:04:35 Is Qatar's exit from OPEC designed to Open the door for the sale of Iranian Oil through Qatar? The CIA should look into Qatar's links to Iran & Terrorism.
2751 2018-12-13 19:04:22 Sooooo, #NTB only lets you get an oil change with an appointment. My appointment was at 1 and it’s now 2 and they’ve yet to touch my car. @tirekingdom
2752 2018-12-13 19:04:18 Palm oil isn't bad, it's how we support deforestation that's bad.
2753 2018-12-13 19:04:16 Thank you Elise.. I hadn't seen this one before.. Signed..xx
2754 2018-12-13 19:04:12 Accept oil! 
2755 2018-12-13 19:04:09 We are waging 8 wars in order to help offense contractors make a profit.

We continue to let Saudi Arabia bomb children because we like their oil and the petrodollar.

We let health insurers profit from price gouging sick people.

Unregulated captialism is just as deadly.

2759 2018-12-13 19:03:09 @gifilk2 what would you prefer do you think we should drill more oil in Alaska or just stop 
2760 2018-12-13 19:03:06 I think it would be wise to share specifics about what 'driving high' means. What are the legal limits of intoxication? Simply having oil in the mouth means nothing. That's the only thing people hear of. Thank you.

2762 2018-12-13 19:02:55 me: what essential oil is good for getting people to stop talking to you?
gf: body odor
2763 2018-12-13 19:02:11 Does Walter have anxiety/heart murmur?

My Daphne has a cough associated with her heart murmur. Her anxiety makes her cough worse because she panics when she starts coughing. We put her on CBD oil a few weeks ago and the cough is better. Not gone, but better.
2764 2018-12-13 19:01:53 Well I was called on to turn on the generator as a teenager alot, I actually liked doing it, I also topped it up with diesel and changed the oil..i bought fuel too.. So yeah I can totally not relate 
2765 2018-12-13 19:01:52 Do u think a GDP that depends of US tax dollar aid for its survival (& it's going through an onslaught of boycotts) is a very sustainable & good thing? Or another county who's sovereign wealth is, say worth $846billion & its people are building alternatives to oil?
2766 2018-12-13 19:01:51 
2767 2018-12-13 19:01:16 I scrub gently once a week and I am never withiut @ClarinsCanada lip oil!
2768 2018-12-13 19:01:15 It works, if it’s applied. Currently the #TrudeauLiberals are not charging carbon tax on 80% of polluting industries and there are no hardcaps on oil sands and upgrading/refining. #cdnpoli
2769 2018-12-13 19:01:15 Water is the best essential oil
2770 2018-12-13 19:01:05 Actually, the correct pluralization is crudes oil.
2771 2018-12-13 19:01:00 So, after you've used a bunch of seafoam uou need a oil change? Awh ok, nobody told me that...

2777 2018-12-13 19:00:27 Make no mistake that if the Trudeau foundation was invested in oil, there would be pipelines down every street in this country

2780 2018-12-13 19:00:07 And with the 350,000-400,000 barrels of extra oil a day due your lobbying, they will suffer the consequences of climate change their whole life.
2781 2018-12-13 18:59:35 @CBCTheNational - Alberta's energy sector seems to be running into roadblocks at every turn. Now there's a bill to ban of oil tankers from Northern Vancouver Island to Alaska. No such bill for the east coast of course. This bothers me to no end. I'm from Vancouver BTW.
2782 2018-12-13 18:59:35 Both you and America are the products of globalism and right now you are working for the oil companies and petrostates who fund Fox News and alt-right media.
2783 2018-12-13 18:59:24 Yo the last thing I’m flexing is the price of my oil change 
2784 2018-12-13 18:59:22 Trump may not be presented as the ideal smooth talking snake oil salesman that so many seem to love about Obama; at least he is what he is & doesn't front. HRC doesn't even know HOW to tell the truth anymore she's lived by aggressive bullying & lying for more years than not.
2785 2018-12-13 18:59:17 What's weird to me about seeing these articles about oil companies actively campaigning to rewrite car emissions standards is that I've known that since I was literally a child.  A thread. 1/
2786 2018-12-13 18:59:16 I want my man to feel that way abt me  butttt i can say that I got a nice lil one right now. He came and got my car today, got an oil change, cleaned it out, I was on E now I’m on F  oh and parked it right back where I had it all in a hr. AND GOT BACK IN HIS OWN SHIT!!!

2788 2018-12-13 18:59:11 and thats with a rescue mission on oil  rly starting to piss me off
2789 2018-12-13 18:59:08 A barrel of Canadian oil should cost at least as much as a quarter... Maybe even a half, if it's schwag.
2790 2018-12-13 18:59:07 I mean boosted at least you have a reason to warm up, I usually do just do get the oil in the supercharger going but yes also you can just drive it normally till it warms up.
2791 2018-12-13 18:58:59 I only chemically exfoliate at night and I use my vitamin c serum/oil morning and night.
2792 2018-12-13 18:58:54 This is not an achievement to the nigerian people bcus uptil know nigeria are producing oil but they can't refine it in her country,  is dis an achievement and uptil know fuel price in nigeria is higher than any country..
2793 2018-12-13 18:58:54 Sorry mahn...I know alot of ppl who have also been denied this year. Our corrupt leaders have ruined everything. Oil producing countries citizens don't have problem with Visa but Nigeria is always the exception. Sorry again bro
2794 2018-12-13 18:58:54 Heh had to use MLB level 100 Pheonix for B2 for faster clear. 20 oil per run not that bad
2795 2018-12-13 18:58:53 My company did tons of work for Devon up in Jackfish on those SAGD wells. Heavy oil is a whole different kettle of fish from what I’m used to in GP. Never seen a rig with a hydraulic co-rod spool affixed to the derrick.
2796 2018-12-13 18:58:45 自分でもびっくりしてる！！
2797 2018-12-13 18:58:39 Did you know you’re supposed to know the mileage on your car b4 getting an oil change ? #adulting
2798 2018-12-13 18:58:24 Acid is good for sensitive/darkskin and usually doesn’t burn people because of it’s molecular weight. I have a vitamin C serum from them as well which is great. And the last product is just oil so 
2799 2018-12-13 18:58:10 Do you  believe the trash in the report.  Oil companies desperately need to get the highest dollar for the oil so they have money to invest in other things and renewable energy sources.  Plus they need cash to cleanup old contaminated wellsites #fossilfuels
2800 2018-12-13 18:58:05 Third book: Reza Negarestani’s Cyclonopedia: Complicity with Anonymous Materials. Reading this feels like House of Leaves meets Deleuze—I’m loving reading about the ‘thingness of oil’, as described through mass market books I’d never read—
2801 2018-12-13 18:57:15 What’s a flex? I was making fun of Ballpark Village while complaining how my oil changes are expensive? Lmao driving an Audi isn’t even a flex
2802 2018-12-13 18:56:57 egg yolks and olive oil... takes effing weeks to have normal looking hair again.
2803 2018-12-13 18:56:57 Area in expansion is GMNP/Del Mtns. Not much farming/oil & gas work. TX RR Comm, TX Comm on Env Qual & TX Dept Lic & Reg already have jurisdiction. CCGCD hasn’t developed rules for area it regulates today! Why create more bureacracy and tax burden?
2804 2018-12-13 18:56:54 Another no action RINO. NO THANKS!!!

He was the only candidate to take on the China problem and trade in general.

That's what is great. We can all pick the issues that are important to us and vote accordingly.

Squeeky wheel gets the oil.
2805 2018-12-13 18:56:46 Exfoliate the skin slightly, then make sure you dry it well, or use an astringent to remove excess oil or sweat.
2806 2018-12-13 18:56:44 We most def oil . Water and vinegar
2807 2018-12-13 18:56:26 It takes 27 hours to change the oil on a Bugatti ... that’s crazy haha
2808 2018-12-13 18:56:12 Hope?  All you're selling is the snake oil of "another oil boom".  Hope has to be grounded in something realistic, not fantasies based on Ayn Rand.
2809 2018-12-13 18:56:11 @TeamCavuto Our stupid politicians are getting ready to throw Saudi Arabia under the bus and we bitch because they are going to cut oil production? for the death of a Muslium Brotherhood member,supported Hamas and Iran and wants to destroy Israel
2810 2018-12-13 18:55:59 Just imagine if we had our oil, fisheries, farming and the rest. We’d be flying
2811 2018-12-13 18:55:54 Christmas by the River 2019.

2813 2018-12-13 18:55:47 the worst thing about getting my oil changed is that the tv in the waiting area is showing law and order and its one of their race issue episodes. cop shoots a black dude and the rest of the episode is digging up evidence why they weren't wrong while protesters are angry at them.
2814 2018-12-13 18:55:35 They way my car drives after a oil change >>>>
2815 2018-12-13 18:55:34 With the cheese that’s not really cheese but oil? Yum!
2816 2018-12-13 18:55:29 I need to clean my room and car go get an oil change and some more but sleep sounds so much better 
2817 2018-12-13 18:55:10 Yes, but I prefer shellac for a number of reasons. I've used danish oil, burned linseed oil, poly, water-based poly, a 3/3/3 mix of blo/poly/mineral spirits, etc
2818 2018-12-13 18:55:08 CBD oil... C-B-D!!!

2820 2018-12-13 18:55:05 I heard Laura Mercier has a decent primer, she has one that’s oil free. Go to Sephora and get a free sample before you buy it though. The Fenty Primer was super matte on me too.
2821 2018-12-13 18:54:56 I hope President Trump invites coal and oil workers instead?
2822 2018-12-13 18:54:53 I use ASOS, I shop from oil mill market in port Harcourt for pre owned(okrika) I have a shoe retailer in Lagos.
2823 2018-12-13 18:54:49 If you make the the Pear and Ginger and olive oil cake don't bother tossing the diced persimmons in lemon juice as it doesn't need it like the pear does.
2824 2018-12-13 18:54:46 Controlling Oil isn't everything. They don't need or want centralized banks. US policy my way or no way!!#God is real & elite 1%er's sure like putting down followers of God. 
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. The #UN was named Lucifer Trust
2825 2018-12-13 18:54:42 #oott: Political tit for tat.  Trump asks SA and MBS for more oil.  They send more.  Mid-terms not helped by lower gas price.  SA orders Military Equip.  Iran sanctions start.  Trump issues 8 waivers.  SA now mad.  SA cuts 500K b/d to U.S.  OPEC meets.   Journalist killed. Chap 1
2826 2018-12-13 18:54:42 my mentor gave me simple advice. If after 20 minutes you haven't struck oil, stop boring.
2827 2018-12-13 18:54:28 #climatechange Caused by #Deforestation and pushed by the #PalmOil industry why don’t we ban palm oil use in New Zealand  if we truely are green @NZGreens
2828 2018-12-13 18:54:27 Or carbon-free nuclear power plants are being replaced by coal/oil/gas/fracking "greenwashed" by intermittent renewables.
2829 2018-12-13 18:54:19 I’m getting an oil change and the guy that works here just randomly started talking to me about raves and I was trying to figure out why
2830 2018-12-13 18:54:14 Mince pies , keep up the great work with saying no to palm oil and spending the word to save the Orangutans . Well done Iceland
2831 2018-12-13 18:54:11 @SajeWellness totally forgot i was gifted with the immune line. Feeling like crap I just bathed in the immune  remedy oil and man do I feel alive! Thank you! #sajewellness #immune #essentials #coldszn
2832 2018-12-13 18:54:10 The recent Senate pensioner open letter had only 9 Repubs. Good luck getting 20 spineless, sitting Repubs to actually take some kind of stand. (Except for oil, coal, climate destruction  and predator S. Ct. nominees.) #VoteBlue #MeToo
2833 2018-12-13 18:54:06 Trump still believes that Snake Oil he sells is going to make him 
once again so slippery that he’ll avoid any trouble.  Not this time.
2834 2018-12-13 18:54:06 Add four handfuls of olive oil then raise the temperature.
2835 2018-12-13 18:53:52 Last night when my suspension was all taken apart it definitely seems like this hasn’t been rebuilt/looked over ever. Draining out 40 year old fork oil was as nasty as it sounds
2836 2018-12-13 18:53:51 Remember this after twn towers were attacked Bush said we will be reimbursed for war with there oil. Where’s that at! But we did give them 1.5 billion
2837 2018-12-13 18:53:42 Coconut oil literally is my holy grail
2838 2018-12-13 18:53:41 There's a 1st time for everything. Today I made a dandelion sandwich, w/ olive oil, salt, green olives & shelled hemp seeds, it was good!
2839 2018-12-13 18:53:37 Hola! Oye cuál es tu usuario de periscope ? Para seguirte !
2840 2018-12-13 18:53:23 "The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks and it will always surfaces above lies as oil floats on water" someone.

2842 2018-12-13 18:53:18 Sure, accepting boatloads of cash from CEOs of oil & gas is perfectly fine. NOT.
2843 2018-12-13 18:53:16 Massive news from #Nigeria: the government alleges that #oil giants @Shell and @eni were partly responsible to "corrupt Nigerian officials" to buy an oil exploration in the #GulfofGuinea and it is taking them to court in #London requesting the return of $1.1 billion
2844 2018-12-13 18:53:14 Whenever you are changing your motorcycle’s fluids, including oil, check the guidelines set by the manufacturer to be sure that you are using the right types of fluids as replacements and the correct amounts of fluids too.
2845 2018-12-13 18:53:13 basically a license to work in the oil field
2846 2018-12-13 18:53:12 i bought the one with coconut oil mixed with another type. also, trash.
2847 2018-12-13 18:52:59 Kamala, Cory, Kirsten, Hillary, and Biden are all in the pockets of Oil, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies and major polluters. They can talk the progressive talk (barely), but the fact is they are corrupt pawns and their track records prove it.

2850 2018-12-13 18:52:07 Read the article

"According to the latest campaign finance report, which covers the period  from Oct. 17 thru Nov. 26, the O’Rourke campaign had not returned 29  “large donations” of over $200 from OIL & GAS EXECUTIVES, violating the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge O’Rourke signed."
2851 2018-12-13 18:52:06 What is an OIL RESORT? :)
2852 2018-12-13 18:52:05 What essential oil will help my GPA rise
2853 2018-12-13 18:52:03 @DNC Thanks for insisting that Trump screw the Saudis! They just announced no oil shipped to the US and now our gas prices will skyrocket going into the 2020 elections and Iran will continue to belligerently claim "Death to America". I hope you are happy with your geopolitics.
2854 2018-12-13 18:52:00 So now that tobacco lost, you’re working for oil? Classy.
2855 2018-12-13 18:51:41 That oil of Olay must be good or there’s some Botox injections going on ? #hasntchanged
2856 2018-12-13 18:51:41 Right now there are several red and white trucks repping the oil and gas industry spreading a bit of Christmas cheer at the school across the street . Those eeeevil bastards.
2857 2018-12-13 18:51:38 What's more: no Monsanto toxic magic, and certainly not half as phoney as most rancid olive oil shelved at your local tesco. There are plenty of notable initiatives in Kent -the garden of England- that now produces decent wine. The UK might just have discovered their terroir!
2858 2018-12-13 18:51:38 @Justin89633972 would you suggest decarboxylating my cannabis oil for treating cancer, or allowing room temperature evaporation and leaving it uncarboxylated? Thanks
2859 2018-12-13 18:51:32 I know if you don't want shaving bumps the best thing is to wax it but make sure you use something that is oil based to shave and also use warm water on it before hand to open up pores Also try exfoliating the area too to stop any ingrown areas 
2860 2018-12-13 18:51:32 I think the people who brought these insane babblings together were geniuses in controlling the masses. They created an anthology of craziness that convinced people to go to war for them, die for them and commit unspeakable acts for them - all with the promise of eternal life.
2861 2018-12-13 18:51:25 Why this man tnya pasal cleansing oil, cuci muka pun idak
2862 2018-12-13 18:51:24 Oil price is low because there is no way to get it to market. Why is it more acceptable to use oil from a terrorist sponsor that's delivered by tanker than buying from Canadians?  Hypocritical.
2863 2018-12-13 18:51:17 Im gonna diffuse some lavender essential oil bc... the stench 
2864 2018-12-13 18:51:12 And let’s also say that Quebec IS and ALWSYS has used our resources and taken more equalization payments than any other province, and those come from OUR resources - yet they plead ‘dirty oil’ while dumping raw sewage in their own rivers.
2865 2018-12-13 18:50:54 Tonight’s dinner goals:
Alfredo.
The most creamy and soul satisfying sauces for pasta.
Today it’s complimented with Chicken, Mushroom and Truffle Oil on Fusilli.
Served until close tonight 
2866 2018-12-13 18:50:46 If you call olive oil a “processed food” you’re most likely in a cult
2867 2018-12-13 18:50:38 You forgot to mention that US doesn't need any oil imports...
2868 2018-12-13 18:50:35 Read the article

2869 2018-12-13 18:50:27 You gotta try the C8 oil. I get mine from Kiss My Keto.
2870 2018-12-13 18:50:18 Paradise Lake Rd is closed @ NE 181st Pl to 204th Ln NE for an oil spill on the road- avoid the area if possible
2871 2018-12-13 18:50:14 This changes with kids.  I always liked the front right, but when your 1yo kid is walking around the gas stove and heated olive oil, you start cooking in the back.
2872 2018-12-13 18:50:00 Oil works but it gets really messy. You can sprinkle cayenne pepper around the pole and dust the pole... It can even go on the feeder. It Will not bother the birds but, the squirrels hate it.
2873 2018-12-13 18:49:59 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
2874 2018-12-13 18:49:51 This would explain Nick Ayers running out of there like he was covered in oil. I saw headlines "trump super pissed" like his boner had just going to Siberia.
2875 2018-12-13 18:49:47 thinking about the time I was like 14 and we were at an olive oil tasting outside of Granada and my sister and I started ripping shots of olive oil and I threw up and had to sit outside in shame while the adults gained cultural perspective
2876 2018-12-13 18:49:45 Still experiencing pain after delivering via c section.. Thinking about trying CBD oil.
2877 2018-12-13 18:49:45 People are dying in record numbers from air pollution.
Extreme weather is the new normal.
The world is burning.

The response from oil companies? Let's spend millions lobbying against any efforts to fight back against climate change. 

We can't let them get away with this.
2878 2018-12-13 18:49:40 Remember the Water Protectors that were trying to protect their own land from oil leaks?

The police and oil company’s private enforcement sent out attack dogs and high pressure water cannons to assault peaceful protestors.

We need to start holding our LEO accountable.
2879 2018-12-13 18:49:37 I love vitamin E oil. best thing ever
2880 2018-12-13 18:49:26 You need to try amala and oats with seasoned palm oil by the side.
2881 2018-12-13 18:49:18 Oil foot, dry foot.
2882 2018-12-13 18:49:18 I’m sitting here getting my oil changed and this man WONT stop talking about Gay people  like dang I understand you think it’s wrong .. but it’s wrong to hate them too!
2883 2018-12-13 18:49:10 Hard to know for sure, as they don't allow a free and open analysis of their oil installations, like the Alberta Oil Sands did, foolishly, thinking they would get an objective review by Jane Fonda or Neil Young. Saudi Arabia is closed to foreigners.
2884 2018-12-13 18:49:08 You & I like oil and water
2885 2018-12-13 18:49:04 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
2886 2018-12-13 18:48:43 My dad is so stubborn about getting an oil change smh
2887 2018-12-13 18:48:40 It wasn't me I don't think James  I like to use w/b paints that apply like oil and have a long wet edge time 
2888 2018-12-13 18:48:33 This peppermint oil got my hair like minty as shit  
2889 2018-12-13 18:48:28 Industrialisation, oil exploration, road building are also causes in decline of caribou of which reindeer are just one of the geographical subspecies. The migrating herds are popular venues for hunters. An hunting websites highlight this.
2890 2018-12-13 18:48:27 They make a million products bro the oil is only one and it probably wasn’t for your hair texture.
2891 2018-12-13 18:48:08 I cannot live without coconut oil.
2892 2018-12-13 18:48:05 “Brittany what do you want for Christmas?”

-health insurance 
-oil change on my car
-food
-hair appointment 

Why can’t that be on my wishlist? 
2893 2018-12-13 18:48:04 Jason - have you ever tried just danish oil?
2894 2018-12-13 18:48:01 After chemist Roger Adams first extracted CBD in the 1940s, research continued well into the 1960s. That's when tests were completed on primates and researchers were able to produce the first CBD oil intended for therapeutic use. British Pharmacopoeia was the first to release it
2895 2018-12-13 18:47:52 He said that Alberta's oil was socially unacceptable in Quebec. Funny......where does he think so much of the money Alberta contribues to Equalization comes from that very industry.  The money's fine but the oil is dirty (his words).
2896 2018-12-13 18:47:43 What was supposed to be a three-branch roundtable to close out the #Osage Oil & Gas Summit will apparently be a two-branch affair instead. No Congress members due to scheduling conflicts.
2897 2018-12-13 18:47:41 @FoodNetwork @TheTedAllen Saw your explanation of Hanukkah on #chopped. No, the Jews did not wounder in the desert when the holiday started. The oil is a myth from several 100 years later but has become a standard for cooking holiday food.
2898 2018-12-13 18:47:34 Lash extensions lowdown: To keep your lashes looking full and fluttery, avoid using oil-based products around your eyes. The oil will break down the glue bond, meaning they will fallout faster. FYI: Be sure to comb through your lashes once a day to stop them bending/crisscrossing
2899 2018-12-13 18:47:27 The Saudi's cutting exports to the US ---Big deal --I guess they don't understand our whole point of shale is so we won't have to buy oil from the Middle East --Use oil as a weapon and we will find ways not to use oil
2900 2018-12-13 18:47:25 one important element,the Emaratis controlling the main sea ports and Saudis oil field, they need to withdraw and give it to Gov
2901 2018-12-13 18:47:24 Upon finding that all of the Mexican coke and unrefined coconut oil has been bought out in one fell swoop, I nervously scan the aisles of the grocery store.
Where is this other? Should I find him and destroy him before his power rivals my own?
2902 2018-12-13 18:47:06 "I bought your land and am turning it into an oil resort" The bot follows the current administration.
2903 2018-12-13 18:46:59 Growing up, i washed my fathers cars, turn on generators, put in fuel and changed oil. Including sweeping and washing plates
2904 2018-12-13 18:46:58 Is he sucking on the olive oil? That's pretty unhygienic.
2905 2018-12-13 18:46:43 some shit that Im positive was designed for white men. lmao I actually use cantu oil at times but iono. I like it for everything but my beard frfr
2906 2018-12-13 18:46:38 Most Well Come  New York Stock Exchange Everybody Oil Unit and Every Company Stock Exchange Everybody
2907 2018-12-13 18:46:32 I am relieved  I changed my oil ,registered my car online , & she’s got a full tank was small kine stressin myself over little things.
2908 2018-12-13 18:46:22 I'll figure something out. There will be a huge political oil spill to clean up when he is gone and more ass holes rushing to fill the vacuum. I'm not worried.
2909 2018-12-13 18:46:13 Needing my gummies and oil 
2910 2018-12-13 18:46:07 Strip mining oil sands in inefficient and wasteful, and no new oil sands operation does it anymore. All new installations are SAGD, which can produce a barrel for as low as $11. 
But Lithium for electric car batteries is strip-mined. So are the rare earth metals for windmills.
2911 2018-12-13 18:46:00 I regularly put coconut oil on my cats and they love it and have beautiful coats now
2912 2018-12-13 18:46:00 Many Albertans are misinformed victims of Stockholm Syndrome, where they identify more with oil companies (who serve shareholders and executives) than they do with their own well-being.
2913 2018-12-13 18:45:54 Oil companies scare the shit out of me. A truly global enemy that has *literally* bought entire governments, and by extension their military and law enforcement arms.
2914 2018-12-13 18:45:48 Trading oil made him rich
2915 2018-12-13 18:45:35 Listen, you need pure coconut oil, the kind you can use for cooking too, nothig added. Use is as you would a mask and thank me later 
2916 2018-12-13 18:45:27 If you are waiting for your Conservative neocon counterparts in the West to fall for your "white genocide" fake news then forget it. You have nothing that they want. No oil. No gold. No diamonds. No land. Nothing. They would rather do business with a corrupt African government.
2917 2018-12-13 18:45:19 MCT oil is good for your health, not necessarily tasty. 
2918 2018-12-13 18:45:11 @ Paige-Erlandson   I need an oil change BADLY
2919 2018-12-13 18:45:10 So I've had my #YouTube account set up and ready to go to launch my channel for a while. But I couldn't think of anything worthy to launch it with. Until ten minutes ago. I am going to do a 'Impressions and reactions video of CBD oil' and record my experience over the 1st week.
2920 2018-12-13 18:44:59 #AAOG bloody hell just hit oil so we can all go home for Christmas happy 
2921 2018-12-13 18:44:53 Maybe you could start the process of actually leaving and stop the process of pretending to leave, no-one's buying May's snake oil.
2922 2018-12-13 18:44:43 Thanks for getting in touch. Monkeys are not used in the harvest of the coconuts used to make either the coconut oil or coconut syrup in our recipes. The Vegan Society requires confirmation of this before they approve our products.
2923 2018-12-13 18:44:31 Well let’s be real. That smoky eye and oil slicked lips is not exactly a day time look. I don’t like her at all. So I don’t feel bad saying any of this. She has a multitude of resources to steer her in a better styled direction.
2924 2018-12-13 18:44:28 謙虚とか、生かされてることに感謝とか、自分の理想に近づいていくとそう思えるようになるんだろうなぁ。
2925 2018-12-13 18:44:28 if ur not on a budget i find that the GlamGlow mud is a good spot treatment but if u r on a budget then tea tree oil is also good (unless u have sensitive skin)
2926 2018-12-13 18:44:27 We also add that ganda smell wala oil :p
2927 2018-12-13 18:44:17 It's also because we have a prime minister with no balls, who will not stand up for our oil industry,or actually any business gains! He's a bad joke !!!
2928 2018-12-13 18:44:15 The woman is asking an employee at Target where the Argoyle Oil is for her hair and I can’t stop giggling inside/won’t help correct her.

2930 2018-12-13 18:44:05 Would you rather have to eat 15lbs of Crawfish, or drink 8oz of Cabal Oil

2932 2018-12-13 18:43:50 Hmmph. Guess I pissed them off by calling out their 'oil could hit $400' after Khashoggi sanctions story ;) But then I'm no dude Samir, just deliberately crude. Good one ya market rock-star!
2933 2018-12-13 18:43:39 amoy efficascent oil ako shet naman
2934 2018-12-13 18:43:23 Yo anyone free for a ride to the dispensary?? I'm out and need some I'll buy a a gram of oil or something
2935 2018-12-13 18:43:19 out of time; plastic and aviation about 100 years ago, a violent world otherwise. longest renaissance ever, where they had to do everything themselves; till snake oil hit the shelves to medicate with narcotics and sugar.
2936 2018-12-13 18:43:19 Why bet on oil stocks when you can get the same upside if oil goes up via Master Limited Partnerships(“MLP”) and get a huge dividend while you wait....
2937 2018-12-13 18:43:18 Texas only has arms for oil apparently.
2938 2018-12-13 18:43:17 What the hell is happening to Canada lately? Quebec and Ontario have always been douchey to #alberta and now BC wants “Alberta oil” to pay for forest fires. 
Why do other provinces hate Alberta so much? What did we do to these folks? #ableg #abpoli #cndpoli
2939 2018-12-13 18:42:54 The skin on my fingers are somehow sensitive, idk why. If oil paint got on my fingers that already have some kind of bubble(idk where they came from, doc didn’t know either) it’ll become bad and irritates me and the paint somehow burns my skin?
2940 2018-12-13 18:42:47 My skin was suffering in this winter weather with lotion alone then I started putting on a shea butter/coconut oil butter that @niqjames made on top of it and my skin has been deliverdt. It’s great when you know how to use it lol
2941 2018-12-13 18:42:29 そこほんとよかった(๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵)
ご飯も美味しかったし！
2942 2018-12-13 18:42:28 #Oil prices rose on Thursday as the International Energy Agency forecast that the market would rebalance faster than it originally thought.
2943 2018-12-13 18:42:22 I saw that fish oil!!! LOL!
2944 2018-12-13 18:42:21 It's in the mint family and contains an oil that stimulates their olfactory bulbs. Usually I find it dried but I found fresh yesterday and the cat started freaking out from the bedroom once I started cutting it up in the kitchen.
2945 2018-12-13 18:42:10 Haven't seen around here in N. OH, were do you shop. If you want alternative to butter an Italian friend used Olive oil as a spread. Flavors it at time with garlic or other herbs like rosemary.
2946 2018-12-13 18:42:05 Burning the midnight oil
2947 2018-12-13 18:42:00 that lavender oil healed my cut over night. so happy
2948 2018-12-13 18:41:58 Y'all be careful the way you eat out.
Remember they've scooped vegetable oil from the gutters.
2949 2018-12-13 18:41:58 And yet we have been doing that steadily for several decades now. And with more money pouring into the tech, new battery chemistries are on the horizon. All that aside, oil/NG is too valuable for other purposes and too damaging to the environment to burn. The future is electric.
2950 2018-12-13 18:41:56 Not in cooking oil, for sure.   Not in meds.  Clothing? It would probably give rashes.
2951 2018-12-13 18:41:51 The Torment Of The Bean -  Oil on internet - 1785
2952 2018-12-13 18:41:49 You didn’t answer the “do you think federal government should tell the Irving where to buy their oil” question.
2953 2018-12-13 18:41:42 Andy was refreshing to watch with his oil analysis tonight. Please get more interviews with him!
2954 2018-12-13 18:41:39 Be careful the way you eat mama put. Remember they've scooped oil from gutters.
2955 2018-12-13 18:41:36 It also shows no solidarity with FNs.  Those prospering from Oil & Gas are in favour of pipelines.  Those not reaping benefits are against.   Now they may not oppose if they get to own pipelines.  There it is. It’s all about the $; not necessarily enviro.
2956 2018-12-13 18:41:34 .@AutoNation marks up BG's MOA oil additive 65%!!!!!!! Bring your own can.
2957 2018-12-13 18:41:29 Oil.  Also if the world is flat, where is the edge?
2958 2018-12-13 18:41:28 I hope my mama know she gone pay for my oil change in my car since she been driving it everyday to work 
2959 2018-12-13 18:41:23 Big deal Mexico doesn't exactly have an abundance of oil...
2960 2018-12-13 18:41:13 Edge control need to come with Kinky Hold Ratings. Lol. 1-5

Olive Oil edge control-0

2961 2018-12-13 18:40:59 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2962 2018-12-13 18:40:59 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2963 2018-12-13 18:40:54 Fooook meee.. That Oil of Olay aint working...  I bought my LP's in 73
2964 2018-12-13 18:40:42 There are 1,000 uses for coconut oil. It’s even amazing for bad breath! Especially for pets !
2965 2018-12-13 18:40:36 Shale oil has a lead time of months, not two years.
2966 2018-12-13 18:40:35 Might I recommend a hot oil wrestling match to determine who stays?

2971 2018-12-13 18:39:56 @AnnCoulter if Obama wanted a wall, he'd have Holder's DOJ sue banks/Oil/coal and let them settle for 10 cent/$ by building a wall. @RealDonaldTrump should sue PlannedParenthood/Soros/Gooble
2972 2018-12-13 18:39:29 The oil industry won’t be satisfied until everything and everyone is dead.
2973 2018-12-13 18:39:26 Buong araw akong di nagopen ng twitter, pag open ko naglulumandi ka. 
2974 2018-12-13 18:39:18 $CL_F $OIL likely has another move down to mid 40's coming before reversal. Still too many early bulls here.
2975 2018-12-13 18:39:03 Start by giving up your oil powered car and heating... Change doesn’t occur without action.
2976 2018-12-13 18:38:57 Wow that is sad. With oil prices heading down for now, probably a good time for them to keep going. Not sure how they will serve LAX/DEL from KEF with A321s...
2977 2018-12-13 18:38:54 Ang mahal ng olive oil!
2978 2018-12-13 18:38:50 export promotion & development is a revival of Afg economy & economic growth for self sustainability. At this stage we r not an economic threat to most of our regional & neighboring countries,iam worried for the day we start planning for major exports such as power energy,oil etc
2979 2018-12-13 18:38:45 Hmm I’ll put money on him working on an oil rig!  #hadsimilar #knob
2980 2018-12-13 18:38:43 Me too! I refer to the “poop chart” to see what’s wrong (too much oil? Not enough fiber?)

2984 2018-12-13 18:38:24 Let us repent from mistaking missionary mythology for missiology. One is water, the other is oil; they don't mix, but have been in the same container since 1492. It's time to dump out the oil.

2986 2018-12-13 18:38:17 The problem was US crude oil stocks surged from 403mb on 28th sept to 431mb on 2Nov or 28mb. Which is a huge reason that OECD inventories were up 5mb
2987 2018-12-13 18:38:10 For those who complain that the ACA has them paying high premiums,I believe Obama's original plan wanted to cut out the big insurance cos,just like Hilary's did back when Bill was in office. DC has more Insurance Co lobbyists than those in the oil industry. That didn't fly well.
2988 2018-12-13 18:38:00 Biscotti (Americanized, butter not olive oil): 1) Almond / anise 2) Almond / almond paste 3) Orange & pecan
2989 2018-12-13 18:37:57 In theory yes, in reality demand outstrip supply, and you end up with palm oil.
If bought from the developing world, palm oil is the better alternative. Rapeseed on the same field is worse.

3000 2018-12-13 18:36:28 FG Targets 2.2m BPD Crude Oil Production By Jan. 2019 –Kachikwuhttp://thepremiernews.com/fg-targets-2-2m-bpd-crude-oil-production-by-jan-2019-kachikwu/
3001 2018-12-13 18:36:23 Nah..... she won’t pour u hot water buh I think she’ll use hot oil sha
3002 2018-12-13 18:36:06 You can't be serious???
3003 2018-12-13 18:36:03 Keep your eye on oil output over the next couple months. Output is high but adversary nations are slashing output. That’s gonna make everything oil related go up. Including natural gas.
3004 2018-12-13 18:36:02 Idk how ur mom does it, but heres how mine does: 
- 2 tortilla 1 egg ratio
- heat up a pan with oil, cut up the tortilla in small bits with ur hands
- fry the tortillas until how crunchy you want them
- add a lil more oil, wait for it to heat a bit
- drop in an egg & salt and mix
3005 2018-12-13 18:35:55 But the key is Saudi spare capacity is only achieved by overproducing their 6 Super Giant old fields which in the past has damaged them. Saudi wants to keep the illusion alive that they have unlimited oil but in truth after a 50 year search they came up dry. Get the popcorn Luke.
3006 2018-12-13 18:35:53 We know the data is manipulated - much of it is public knowledge and even admitted.

When I was in the wind business, the big players were oil companies. And for obvious reasons given the way rising energy prices goes straight to their bottom line.
3007 2018-12-13 18:35:35 I’ve actually never used coconut oil but I’ve always wanted to. How exactly do you use it? Do you buy it from the food section and heat it up? I’m so curious
3008 2018-12-13 18:35:21 The #BulletproofCoffee yesterday, which I unfortunately used too much coconut oil in, kept me from eating dinner yesterday and will likely result in this being my first 24 hour fast on #Keto.

It's been 22.5 hours since I last had any calories and feel fine. Crazy.
3009 2018-12-13 18:35:18 Cleaning my house today has made my little heart so happy&content. I’ve got my fav essential oil candles burning and while watching SVU  it’s a wonderful day and it’s only 1:40

3013 2018-12-13 18:34:33 Yes, indeed. But that could've happened in Scotland, the US and many other places too. The difference is that we had the wherwithal to properly tax the profits of the oil companies that borrow our natural resources.

3017 2018-12-13 18:34:17 Ek bat bata bhai. Petrol ka price crude oil par depend hota hai world market ke uper..so bjp ne kyu jhuta jumla diya ki petrol ka price kam karenge 2014 main. Aur sabne modi ko vote isliye diya ki price kam hoga. But price bada. So bjp aur Congress main kya fark hua?
3018 2018-12-13 18:34:07 It is true and it’s not clinging

the industry is still going to be around for decades no matter what enviro nuts say...

Successful green tech is decades away... and even then petroleum products are needed

No one is going cold turkey on oil

3021 2018-12-13 18:33:59 Here's a little work for journalists:
1) Paulwell claims during his tenure as minister he was "informed" of oil losses, took steps and the numbers were less...then they increased  again when govt changed...kindly ask him to state WHAT caused losses and what was done as prevention
3022 2018-12-13 18:33:58 I think you are being too naive. The only "modernization and moderation" going on in SA is window dressing to make their Islamic dogma more acceptable to the west in order to protect and build their economic interests as exporting oil to the west is in decline. Look at Yemen.
3023 2018-12-13 18:33:16 Have white ppl stolen gold? Check. Land? Check. Children? Check. Oil? Check? Women so that they can rape them? Check. Homes? Check. Names? Check (changed kunta to Toby) spices? Check. Jewels? Check?. Bodies and dna? Check (henrietta lacks) limbs? Check (cut off Kuntas foot)
3024 2018-12-13 18:33:08 Oil is cheap .60 65 dollars on China news will spike the price in both oil and natural gas..Production cost.Unfortunately unstable conditions with Russia and Iran..All we need as a catalyst is a weak dollar.Fed one and done..I bet it and will continue to add to positions under 51

I'd like to see be progressive & set an example. If gov't put the best academic brains together we have in in this country they could create green energy that creates a profit, helps the people, & environment.

Then that's it, other than cleaning the workshop, seeing a few customers and drinking Christmas. Back on it in Jan!

3039 2018-12-13 18:31:00 Here are five times that Dwight did or said something that made us think of how ridiculous Fractivists sound talking about oil and gas.
3040 2018-12-13 18:30:54 Never said we can’t. Like I said, politicians ignore climate change as an issue for whatever reason (oil money or plain ignorance) and try to smokescreen it like the public will forget simply because they discuss other popular issues

3046 2018-12-13 18:30:05 No oil companies, yes.
3047 2018-12-13 18:29:57 เดมไปนะคะ
3048 2018-12-13 18:29:43 As an aggregate forced selling only happens when you are largely on the wrong side of a trade with leverage. I know basic. But this is not it. Maybe some from an oil trade gone horribly but largely no
3049 2018-12-13 18:29:41 Wherein "nothing" is defined as: "saving the planet, making the water and air cleaner, and reducing our reliance on foreign oil that currently embroils us in conflicts that cost trillions and thousands of lives."
3050 2018-12-13 18:29:38 Rubbish. In that case only talk about oil and gas and keep other views to yourself.
3051 2018-12-13 18:29:32 if they are please run them over with your freshly changed oil car
3052 2018-12-13 18:29:30 Yeah but nobody wants their oil. This is dumb af. 
3053 2018-12-13 18:29:29 Also, witch hazel is an astringent as it removes excess oil from the skin. It’s not going to balance pH like a toner will. This is most likely making your skin more sensitive, along with the essential oils you are using.
3054 2018-12-13 18:29:27 Care to share some names of those discounted junior oil producers?
3055 2018-12-13 18:29:17 Can you tell the difference between Iraq Arabs & Kuwait Arabs? The Emir of Kuwait is the only one who knows it. Iraqi annexation of Kuwait was bloodless. And who may 100% prove that Hussein did something absolutely wrong? Americans who didn't want Iraq to get that much oil?
3056 2018-12-13 18:29:17 okay so they repoed my car by mistake and dented my oil pan while towing it

I'm very angry
3057 2018-12-13 18:29:12 If my dad was like some of these clowns in oil patch, he'd be drinking lucky, hate listening to rw talk radio, blaming trudeau for his miserable existence instead of working day and night at odd jobs to put food on table during layoffs
3058 2018-12-13 18:28:52 spoiled coconut oil is by far the worst smell I have ever smelled
3059 2018-12-13 18:28:49 You say zero consequences. First, Rich was involved in the food for oil scandal thru his vassal oil companies which cost us men and materials in the war in Iraq with secret accounts to fund Saddam's war machine. Second, he was breaking unions in the aluminum business in the US.
3060 2018-12-13 18:28:46 So if the latest pic of live action Sonic is legit, then he does look realistic .... a realistic oil painting of Sonic mind you, but realistic none the less.
3061 2018-12-13 18:28:42 I used to only use coco oil but I found this cocoa butter lotion I’ve been digging on more recently but no matter how you get it hydration has always helped my oily skin.
3062 2018-12-13 18:28:42 The Westminster "Coin Shaving" has cost #Scotland One Trillion from Oil Revenue.
If we use #ScotRef for #ScotlandinEurope

We may avoid them taking another Trillion to pay for their #Brexit.
3063 2018-12-13 18:28:38 Do you ever just stop and think about how great it is to not work in the oil and gas sector? I do probably once per day, maybe more
3064 2018-12-13 18:28:36 This tweet from him is the equivalent of the "I am not a crook" from Nixon. People will forever associate the name Trump with a vision of an orange conman melting into a puddle of oil whilst screaming "WITCH HUNT!"

3067 2018-12-13 18:28:18 You are so right! Such bad government was willingly embraced. Read this morning about Lougheed plans for all our oil to be refined before it left Alberta. What the heck happened? We can’t point fingers elsewhere, can we.
3068 2018-12-13 18:28:16 Especially essential oil sales people?
3069 2018-12-13 18:28:08 For how long will this import of petroleum products continue in a country that has crude oil??
3070 2018-12-13 18:27:54 We were practicing oil changes today and we all just sort of agreed were gonna take the 1min time hit to skip checking the fuckin air filter on this car. I dropped a screw and used a quarter of my time before i gave up for the day

3075 2018-12-13 18:27:30 Do you know why this is though? Because the wealthier more greedy countries are keeping them in poverty for their own gains. "Our oil, our gold, or else --> war". At least that's a theory. Ripple are going to empower 3rd world citizens, what capitalist banks haven't managed.
3076 2018-12-13 18:27:28 trading oil put a nail in the coffin
3077 2018-12-13 18:27:23 Told colt the oil change place was trying to get over on me and he said “did you not tell them who you were?” 
Oh yeah, I forgot we are Greenbriers elite. 
3078 2018-12-13 18:27:18 Discovered last night that popcorn is delicious when popped with ghee instead of vegetable oil .. not just drizzled on top
3079 2018-12-13 18:27:08 So apparently if you don’t make time to change your oil, your car will make time for you 
3080 2018-12-13 18:27:04 Yeah I don’t have a moisturizer right now so I just my coco oil and it does fine.
3081 2018-12-13 18:27:00 
3082 2018-12-13 18:26:57 Well, oil one day will run out, brains just keep giving and already now Israel’s GDP per capita exceeds all Arab countries. How did they manage? Lots of talent and good decision making just like their votes at the UN..

3085 2018-12-13 18:26:42 I'm rather more amused st this #BoycottLush thing that was going on last week.

3088 2018-12-13 18:26:22 Watch ‘Stink’ on Netflix. I swear you’ll never use anything other than coconut oil again. its about all the carcinogens that make up fragranced soaps, lotions, shampoos etc.
3089 2018-12-13 18:26:19 Funny, the Unifor president also has how many oil sands workers he’s supposed to represent?

3092 2018-12-13 18:25:55 We used to tell people to call ahead. Cooking that many nuggets at once will bring down the oil temp fast!

3097 2018-12-13 18:24:24 There is a lot of crap out there with contents you do not want to have or that don't work. Independent lab testing is critical, as is company transparency. I use a full spectrum oil, which has trace THC. I find it works better for me. 3.

Someone needed to hear that.
3100 2018-12-13 18:24:13 Haha, no. Just plain ol' butter and corn popped in oil that hasn't been changed since the Carter administration. 

But we're talking about a place that can't afford to do anything about the black mold in the ceiling, so if my $5 for popcorn can help them keep the lights on...
3101 2018-12-13 18:24:09 Coordinated effort by big oil and auto to limit success of the biggest threat to auto/energy industries in a long time. I’ve never seen anything like this happen for any other company.

3104 2018-12-13 18:24:01 Keep focusing on our oil and gas industry that provides native Texans and conservatives jobs instead of companies bringing Liberal California with them. These people aren’t smart enough to vote against why their company left in the first place.
3105 2018-12-13 18:23:54 Those who are anointed would do well to remember that oil and wine do not mix.
3106 2018-12-13 18:23:50 baaad influence!
You just can't help it that CBD is helping.
Oil is easy for the system. I vaped cbd-liquid the other day and fell asleep 
3107 2018-12-13 18:23:38 put coconut oil in my coffee this morning because people told me it was good.

it is not. stop lying to yourselves
3108 2018-12-13 18:23:34 @dandakich I assume the cod oil only grew your height, everything else stayed family proportional
3109 2018-12-13 18:23:29 He was asking a lot of questions about oil pipelines in Sudan and South Sudan in 2012. You could probably piece together his ‘holiday’ history.
3110 2018-12-13 18:23:28 Oil price low enough yet?
3111 2018-12-13 18:23:27 Why don’t we apply a national tax to those provinces who do not support oil/pipelines on at their gas pumps.. then we will apply that money to their equalization payments!
3112 2018-12-13 18:23:19 The @SCBroncos have traded Andrew Ftyen to the Edmonton Oil Kings for a conditional fifth round pick in 2020
3113 2018-12-13 18:23:18 The timing of this unmasking can not be more accurate. Keep opening the eyes of all and let the International communities keep pretending they don't hear for the sake of oil.
3114 2018-12-13 18:23:12 I don’t get own my level oil
3115 2018-12-13 18:23:08 It’s Alberta’s oil the same way it’s our lumber coal gas little bit of oil gold and water here

Resources are provincial jurisdiction they don’t belong to someone on the other side of the damn continent
3116 2018-12-13 18:23:07 Venezuela was THRIVING.  they were exporters of food and have the biggest oil reserves on earth.  in 10 years, socialism turned it into a starving penury.  this is the system you like?  seriously?  oil and farming are so easy feudal monarchies can do it.  but not socialism...
3117 2018-12-13 18:22:59 Oh for the love of god, please don’t put essential oils on your skin without them being in a carrier oil. Also don’t use scrubs, especially coffee grounds and sugar. It’s okay for your body, but not the face. Acne/bacteria in general loves sugar so doing this can make it worse.
3118 2018-12-13 18:22:57 My favorite blends are from @EdensGardenOils 
There's an oil called "vitex" that some use for sleep, but I've never used it
3119 2018-12-13 18:22:56 SHARE...LAUGHABLE 99% is there blame, coulda had the money like NOrway but nah, tax breaks for the rich and oil Companies!!!!

Share the blame, ...Fuck right off.
3120 2018-12-13 18:22:56 I’ve only put on a face to test it out, I haven’t worn it outside yet but it’s pretty decent so far. I paired it with their baking oil and used the It cosmetics concealer so I can still glow. It’s a perfect skin match.
3121 2018-12-13 18:22:52 #NoPalmOilChristmas Black Forest Layered Pavlova. Looks amazing, suitable for vegetarians with no wheat and no palm oil. Every single one of my Christmas guests catered for in one product #doesnothappenoften !
3122 2018-12-13 18:22:49 I've heard this too? bc it's almost entirely ground corn (and oil), so RELATIVELY, it's "healthier" but chips are such garbage usually, so it's like saying rotten eggs are healthier than cyanide. True...BUT
3123 2018-12-13 18:22:49 Life is cheaper in TX. Truth is, Texas is more rural than the other two states. Their economy is based on oil, farming & now green energy. You know Carli on its own is 5th in the world in economic standing. We know how big and the economic mix they have.
3124 2018-12-13 18:22:48 #DontCryOverSpilled anything except stuff like non biodegradable glitter or oil which is bad for the environment which  we only exist because of.
3125 2018-12-13 18:22:45 Wow glass impurities. In other words, not massive amounts to green house gasses that are produced by coal, oil, and natural gas sources of energy. Is your implication that we should solve the immediate problem cause the solution has it's own, different problems?
3126 2018-12-13 18:22:36 Baby Oil Sessions
3127 2018-12-13 18:22:29 Shut off all gas and oil to B.C. and see if that fixes the climate prob Whistler is whining about.  Boycott whistler !!
3128 2018-12-13 18:22:19 Silence for Hebrew Biafra continuous GENOCIDE since it is done by the Edomite British Govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas. TRUTH is SUPREME.
3129 2018-12-13 18:22:09 Life hack - Mince edition: heat mince on stove to drain oil then re-cook in own oil to avoid excessive said oil
3130 2018-12-13 18:22:09 Looking at heating oil and it's a third more expensive than last year. That's nearly £100 extra. #GTTO
3131 2018-12-13 18:22:09 We would have been complete idiots to have voted yes in 2014. Completely imaginary oil income projections, a huge starting fiscal deficit, no curr NYC, out of the EU with no prospect of early reentry. You clearly haven't thought this through.
3132 2018-12-13 18:21:48 Joshua Rogers - Pour Your Oil
3133 2018-12-13 18:21:41 People think if you have oily skin you don’t need moisturizing products & you do! The dryer your skin the more oil you’ll produce to combat that. So moisturize, use oils, serums, etc.
3134 2018-12-13 18:21:39 i-im so oily… *shivers and slips on copious amount of oil*
3135 2018-12-13 18:21:23 We are already taxed more north of the border thanks to SNP accountancy, they forget to show all the books and oil is miles less than snp predicted. #telltgetruth #snplies
3136 2018-12-13 18:21:20 I use as much plastic and oil products as I can just to stick it to liberals. Eat it liberals. This is how we win, watch liberals cry when I pour oil into the river. MAGA!!!!
3137 2018-12-13 18:20:57 And coconut oil
3138 2018-12-13 18:20:51 Ha I just tweeted this David...."Funny to watch the State continue today to try to rig oil prices without much success. "#HFT
3139 2018-12-13 18:20:51 I'm pretty fucking angry (not surprised) at the fact that Congress didn't do a goddamn thing to end US involvement in aiding in destroying Yemen.   No ethical or moral millionaire member exists within it's chambers.  They're all snake oil salesmen & sociopaths.
3140 2018-12-13 18:20:50 Andy HAll on Bloomberg: " U.S. shale output is great imponderable" #oil #shale #energy
3141 2018-12-13 18:20:50 Cool, so my car’s in the shop until tomorrow with an oil leak and wipers that don’t work. Looking to be a couple thousand altogether. Happy birthday to meeeee
3142 2018-12-13 18:20:47 You are a walking plunger, scouting for oil and gas. Classy.
3143 2018-12-13 18:20:33 @BlackRock must shift its investments away from the industries destroying  the vital Amazon rainforest & the homes of its indigenous  inhabitants. 
 Many of the oil, mining, and agribusiness activities in which BlackRock  holds shares actively worsen our climate  crisis. #Stop
3144 2018-12-13 18:20:29 To whom this may concern:
- My Low Gas Light
- My “Change Oil” Notification 
- My Truck payment

Could you go away please, I am just trying to buy my friends and family some christmas gifts right now. Thank you 
3145 2018-12-13 18:20:27 #Canada doesn't  use your oil. 

The whole point of the pipeline is to get the bitumen over to customers with  refineries that can handle it. 
#US, currently with a surplus of cleaner oil, doesn't  need.

Hence discount, & why many nations won't buy the oil @ full price.
#abpoli
3146 2018-12-13 18:20:23 We've lived with the lowest taxes in the country so we could fund daily gov't operations with unreliable, boom and bust oil royalties. We've had five recessions because of this. We haven't paid our way, we haven't planned for the future - and Jason Kenney wants more of the same.
3147 2018-12-13 18:20:21 She said she will get castor oil also
3148 2018-12-13 18:20:16 It looked like cooking oil at first.
3149 2018-12-13 18:20:12 Be careful how you treat me; there’s oil on me !
3150 2018-12-13 18:19:57 Oil ain't dead dinos
3151 2018-12-13 18:19:55 no a field of oil seed rape.
3152 2018-12-13 18:19:50 He likes those numbers I’d think when factoring in low unemployment and a lot of job openings but also some other underlying good signs ie oil jobs.
3153 2018-12-13 18:19:47 Right along with the drug companies, oil, and the rest
3154 2018-12-13 18:19:34 The thing taya me o. Justifying rubbish
3155 2018-12-13 18:19:30 Funny to watch the State continue today to try to rig oil prices without much success. #HFT
3156 2018-12-13 18:19:22 Is that Cannabis oil with the psychoactive chemicals - or without? Just trying to keep track of how this is panning out globally.
3157 2018-12-13 18:19:10 Dude. You gotta have a lavish party at taxpayers expense where y'all congregate and slap each other on the back about how stupid Middle America is and how great the propoganda machine is rolling. 

Otherwise they won't know how important they are if they don't tell each other.
3158 2018-12-13 18:19:07 Translation: Someone bid up my oil so I can sell it.
3159 2018-12-13 18:19:04 Invisible builds are invisible, easy as that.
The actual point is that US needs imported Oil because their shale is not good enough for everything done in raffinery. This handling of KSA could lead to a shortage of specific raffinery-products.
3160 2018-12-13 18:18:56 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
3161 2018-12-13 18:18:53 The oil industry buys its social licence by hiding the costs and bribing the locals. Blankets and smallpox.
3162 2018-12-13 18:18:50 US production is of the shale variety. Much faster and easier than oil sands mega-projects.
3163 2018-12-13 18:18:39 When the wind don't blow and the sun don't shine you'll wish that oil backup was available.
3164 2018-12-13 18:18:31 I would like to recommend you guys the homemade scrub 2 spoons of sugar with 1 spoon of olive oil twice a week. It makes your skin so soft and if anybody has scars it’s a v v good scars removal. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

3168 2018-12-13 18:18:16 and opium epidemics spreading like unraked-brush fires in the United States. They weren't products of Western nations, at bottom. They were products of Afghanistan and other Islamist countries. They were no less addictive or insidious than all that crude oil we buy>>>
3169 2018-12-13 18:18:10 I can’t touch oil paint lol
3170 2018-12-13 18:18:05 So you should get to charge an oil company because of weather events? Fml
3171 2018-12-13 18:18:04 Andy Hall on Bloomberg: "probably better off betting that oil will rise", "don't see world falling into global recession"  #oil #energy #shale

3173 2018-12-13 18:17:49 Why did Trudeau liberals allow construction of the McInnis cement factory in Gaspe that will emit between 1.8 and 2.2 million tons of greenhouse gases a year according to Canada’s environment ministry, and will dwarf yearly emissions of Shell Canada’s oil sands in Fort McMurray?
3174 2018-12-13 18:17:46 Am I the only one sitting at the oil change place, looking at Joy like dang she's bad, while watching this with no volume?
3175 2018-12-13 18:17:46 It was supposed president that sides with a Saudi Crown Prince that had Mr Khashoggi  murdered because of oil and money.  Shameful.  There is NO price large enough or any amount of oil that could be compared to a man's life.
3176 2018-12-13 18:17:44 Over the past 15 years, more than 200,000 minors married in US, and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001, before the state set a minimum age of 17 in 2018.
3177 2018-12-13 18:17:35 Not at all confusing, palm oil is destroying rainforest.  End of story.

3179 2018-12-13 18:17:32 I just enjoy sanding and staining and linseed oil and wonder if I could carve abstract little curvy wooden shapes.
3180 2018-12-13 18:17:27 This is not about Austin.  This is about controlling the Texas state legislature and gaining control over the TX Railroad Commission which controls oil and gas production in TX.  Mark my words, this is about OIL and OIL MONEY!
3181 2018-12-13 18:17:19 Some high quality junior #oil producers are actually trading 0.5 - 1.9x cash flow.  Top teams, great assets, making money...but nobody cares.

3186 2018-12-13 18:16:27 You seem like a good kid, albeit a climate change denier. I see my arguments won't change your viewpoint. But indulge me a moment anyways.
What if I am wrong? Fair enough, however, transition to green energy won't kill anyone except oil profits
What if you are wrong? People die!

Look for them and compensate them before they open the wounds of The Nigerian Police for ill treatment they have received.
3194 2018-12-13 18:16:04 Lol maybe they deserve to be suspended

3204 2018-12-13 18:15:20 Trump won what?  Schumer got frump yo take blame for any shutdown,  and Speaker Pelosi ripped his balls off,  sauteed them in garlic and truffle oil, and served them to him on a toasted crostini.
3205 2018-12-13 18:15:12 I'm of the view that if you are a democratically elected MP thinking of delivering on a referendum result that works against the interests of your constituency then you shouldn't be an MP. Representative democracy and referenda are like oil and water. They don't mix.
3206 2018-12-13 18:15:02 My greatest prayer is for the oil exploration in the north to be successful so the northern elite can let the rest of Nigeria go in peace. We can’t continued like this. One side is going forward and another side going backwards.

3216 2018-12-13 18:14:07 Funny. Alberta is the only province that has no sales tax.The PC guy running for office drafted the Reansfer Payment mechanism. When the price of oil was at $100 per barrel, Albertans were rolling. It is below $65 now?
3217 2018-12-13 18:14:04 @marcorubio You disingenuous little bastard.

The fight for workers’ rights is not only with business, but is legislative, as well. You know this.

Until then, STFU.

-I was just having a little chuckle & fun at pondering other "oil"-type things (even in name only) they might try after WD40.

3229 2018-12-13 18:13:04 Different gearbox ratios, and you can isolate engines on 185s. The 170 gearboxes were not getting up enough speed to switch up to second phase, and as such were drinking gearbox oil.
3230 2018-12-13 18:13:01 Yes u can. And you can produce for free with solar/wind/hydro.  Unlike fossil 

But tell me, why do you want to make poor people pay Big Oil/Coal $$$ for their fuel?  You wanna make your fossil fuel buddies even richer $$$?

3235 2018-12-13 18:12:37 Oh god...I can take whatever criticism. But associating me with Lutz is where I draw the line.  I guess I'll leave you guys to teach the EPA and automakers and oil companies how to do it.

3237 2018-12-13 18:12:20 Nothing made me feel more like a grownup than taking my car in for its inspection and not having anything wrong with it. He just gave me an oil change and slapped a sticker on that sucker!
3238 2018-12-13 18:12:19 next time i need a person with some car knowledge to come with me to get an oil change cause now I’m out 200 dollars so that’s cool.
3239 2018-12-13 18:12:18 Vicky’s hella cool man, he just taught me how to do an oil change and how to check for leaks and seal them. I wish his girlfriend wasn’t such a hater tho lol
3240 2018-12-13 18:12:14 Yeah, but we also need to factor the percentage composition of oil tax in making the comparison on a Dollar basis. Would imagine that the non-oil component would mostly be in naira.
3241 2018-12-13 18:12:11 As transparent as an oil spill.
3242 2018-12-13 18:11:53 Sounds like a lot of steps for a new $500 machine If your gonna buy someone a car for  first you fill up with gas 2.changes the oil 3 new tires...... WHAT!
3243 2018-12-13 18:11:45 I'm guessing they aren't coming from Corn, soybean and canola oil
3244 2018-12-13 18:11:43 An oil change in my Audi is $115 are you joking me? Damn that’s like 5 drinks at Ballpark Village
3245 2018-12-13 18:11:39 A wet brush brand brush, straightener and a fuck load of oil and leave in conditioner.  I love miracle 7 with keratin miracle oil. I just clip it up if i don’t want it in my face but tangles only are helped  if i straighten my hair
3246 2018-12-13 18:11:39 Standard Oil was good? Reconstruction was bad? FDR caused the Depression?
3247 2018-12-13 18:11:38 can someone yell at me to get my oil changed I rlly need it but I don’t wanna go bc they were mean to me last time I went :/
3248 2018-12-13 18:11:37 Oil will stay. Best used to make plastics, adhesives, foams, composites etc. Not worth burning it.
3249 2018-12-13 18:11:17 This government has not developed any other sector, all they believe in is oil!
Haba!
3250 2018-12-13 18:11:16 Burning the midnight oil
3251 2018-12-13 18:11:15 California Coastal Commission hearing on oil development, wetlands land swap project starting in about 10 minutes. The body just adjourned to set up for what's likely to be a lengthy process that could result in a permit being approved for expanded oil production in SE Long Beach
3252 2018-12-13 18:11:10 Ive definitely been educated. Never knew Coconut oil contains saturated fat!
3253 2018-12-13 18:11:10 Can't turn our backs on a province that's looked down their noses on the rest of Canada, claiming to 'pay' everyone's bills - for decades! And the contempt for BC protecting 'its' coastline! Rich, coming from the province who guards 'its' oil! Hypocrites!
3254 2018-12-13 18:11:09 Mix a little coffee into coconut oil and exfoliate them then add the nipple cream = baby butt smooth lips 
3255 2018-12-13 18:11:00 Eco styler with argon oil

3257 2018-12-13 18:10:50 black castor oil might do it don’t come back in my mentions till you got results!
3258 2018-12-13 18:10:47 Cooking oil is a good usecase considering the whole gutter oil shenanigans
3259 2018-12-13 18:10:44 CBD oil
3260 2018-12-13 18:10:36 Short and Sweet is the best jam on this list
3261 2018-12-13 18:10:31 Skunk oil
3262 2018-12-13 18:10:24 After a turbulent two months during which oil prices plummeted from a four-year high to a one-year low, investors may wonder what comes next for U.S. crude.
3263 2018-12-13 18:10:24 Except used to be just dripping, and now they're going down the heart disease route by using seed oil as well and less dripping.
3264 2018-12-13 18:10:20 No me acuerdo en que texto pero había uno que hablaba como Hitler se derrotó gloriosamente a la burguesía controlada por los bancos judios y re que al bigotudo lo financió hasta la Standard Oil y Feder siguio permitiendo la iniciativa privada por ser "libre y creativa" xd
3265 2018-12-13 18:10:19 エルザに殴られたなう
3266 2018-12-13 18:10:16 I got 6 beauty sponges, hydrating oil, highlight, setting powder, foundation and a free palette for $70 from Beauty Bakerie.

3268 2018-12-13 18:09:56 spend money wiseily lower gas prices and oil for 3 months
3269 2018-12-13 18:09:52 ANDY HALL: PROBABLY `BETTER OFF' BETTING OIL WILL RISE

especially if you have a hedge fund that is long oil
3270 2018-12-13 18:09:39 With a bloody crash, the ghoul barreled into us. I couldn't help but scream when my leg snapped. When I opened my eyes, I saw a lamp had broken off the rail, spilling burning oil inches from my face. Without the rowing crew, all we have are the lifeboats.
#unlife #FlashThursday
3271 2018-12-13 18:09:34 Again pdp ruled Nigeria for 16 yrs, oil prices were at record highs for most of that time. What did they do with the revenue? Now you're blaming APC and want to vote for the people that caused the problem to fix it. Then u wonder y Nigeria is not progressing
3272 2018-12-13 18:09:26 Even if we were to increase exports to Mexico, how does he figure that those proceeds would be distributed equitably to taxpayers, he makes snake oil salesmen look like saints.
3273 2018-12-13 18:09:22 Hey twitter I need a moisturizer for my face that isn’t so oily...I have no idea where to look or what to search for lol. I normally put coconut oil on my face but that clogs my pours lol
3274 2018-12-13 18:09:16 Thanks @SenateGOP @SenateDems Over one reporter a Saudi citizen, you caused Saudi to target   on oil! They are a ally. You are pushing them to China,Russia, & destabilizing the middle east.
3275 2018-12-13 18:09:16 I’m glad I was fully stoned when I ordered my 22$ tiny bottle of essential oil, cuz that price would’ve given me hesitation.
3276 2018-12-13 18:09:15 I saw a recent interview where Momoa confirmed that was part of Snyder's original plan, that Arthur was the one that rescued Clark from the water after the oil rig.
3277 2018-12-13 18:08:53 Babe did you find any oil? I think I found a place that has it for you.
3278 2018-12-13 18:08:51 Ugly Blondes - Oil and Wine
3279 2018-12-13 18:08:49 That has to be a challenging balancing act in academic writing. You want to make it sound fresh and appealing, so as to interest people, but you don't want to sound like you're selling snake oil.  Good luck! I hope your find an outlet for it.
3280 2018-12-13 18:08:42 Se quedaron sin gas oil, las muy nabas.
3281 2018-12-13 18:08:25 My favorite no palm oil food is fresh mango.
3282 2018-12-13 18:08:23 I need an oil massage, damn.
3283 2018-12-13 18:08:22 My cars oil changes are $50... yeah I’m about to start doing this myself
3284 2018-12-13 18:08:16 Wesay Instagram per there are many hair oil hair regrowth k liye Fikar not
3285 2018-12-13 18:08:12 This is so silly. These were long growing trends. The US was headed towards becoming the world’s largest oil producer under Obama because of fracking tech, we just hit it after he left. Presidents don’t deserve credit for those things.
3286 2018-12-13 18:08:08 *passes the oil can*
3287 2018-12-13 18:07:58 A personal resolution for 2019 is to stop retweeting sad climate news and to start really harassing oil company accounts/ execs/ employees instead. I don't have the following to spread news or effect opinions but I bet I can get a couple social media managers to quit their jobs.
3288 2018-12-13 18:07:57 Could they come visit our country? Our government has already started a new oil refinery and is planning on more. We wish they could look towards clean energy, instead.
3289 2018-12-13 18:07:32 Western alienation is only relevant because Alberta politicians find it an easy way to drum up support for themselves. In reality, its not real. The federal government has poured A LOT of money into the AB oil sector.  AB isn't the savior of the country nor the most important.
3290 2018-12-13 18:07:30 Don’t forget the men in your life.  #63
Beard oil, after shave balm,shave soap and brush, soap on a road, hand cream, and eau de toilette.
3291 2018-12-13 18:07:17 Normal to Oily skin, look for Even & Matte range. 

oily skin, look for the Oil Complete Control range

They also have the Pure Active 3 in 1 (Wash, Scrub, Mask) White and Charcoal. Both for oily skin.

Find out your skin type 1st tho
3292 2018-12-13 18:06:59 Coal is plant matter. From before bacteria could break down cellulose. Which is why no new coal forms.
Oil is just animal matter.
3293 2018-12-13 18:06:54 Yeah when all the oil runs out.
3294 2018-12-13 18:06:52 Some of the best #oil stocks are now trading 1.5 - 2.3x 2019 cash flows based on today's strip.  In 2014 they traded 9x; never seen multiple compression on such quality companies in my life.  Institutional capital being blown out of the space this week creating big discounts.
3295 2018-12-13 18:06:41 Mexico buys all of it oil from the USA and pays the 2nd highest price per barrel worldwide eventhough they can get for half the price from Venezuela.   The price for avocados and lime went up because of the bad weather in recent years due to global warming.
3296 2018-12-13 18:06:40 Ai may na-discover ako para mag last pero baka ginagawa niyo na 

Alcohol muna yun nail bed para walang oil 

Tapos yun top coat dapat hanggang tip like pinaka gilid  minsan hanggang sa baba ng kuko saakin 

Umaabot na saakin 5days-1 week 
3297 2018-12-13 18:06:40 おいるさんよしよし...無理しないでくださいね？
3298 2018-12-13 18:06:35 More #Venezuela, #PDVSA Petro San Felix, the Venezuelan oil upgrader that produces synthetic oil Petrozuata, is currently shut for unplanned repairs and won’t restart until early 2019, BBG #OOTT
3299 2018-12-13 18:06:33 Why car places always trying to get over? My oil change comes with a tire rotation and they needed to reset my TPMS. They gon say if you wanted that then you should have mentioned it in the beginning.  What?
3300 2018-12-13 18:06:16 @MysticxLipstick do you think taking an omega3 supplement is just as useful for weight loss as taking cod liver oil/butter supplement ?
3301 2018-12-13 18:06:06 No thanks, I’d rather pour salt in my eyes than to watch Fox try to sell me your snake oil. You can answer all of the softball questions you want to on Fox, but you’re still guilty and going to prison.
3302 2018-12-13 18:06:05 Gas is at $2 because we are no longer as dependent on oil from the OPEC. Our consumption hasn't exactly decreased.

He is the one that lobbies and determines the DoD's budget. I could go on, but all this is basic shit. Something tells me you're not too keen on IR. I am.
3303 2018-12-13 18:05:57 Yes, vape is just a device to vaporize something. There are a variety of types, from ones built with a wick and meant for e-juices, to ones with a metal coil and meant for hash oil/dabs, to some that are meant for marijuana plant matter. I'd say middle one is most popular for THC
3304 2018-12-13 18:05:40 Who are his "better angels"? Big Oil, the Saudis, the NRA, Wall street?
3305 2018-12-13 18:05:40 So much for Our $1.98 a gallon gas. Because part of our government insisted on making the Saudi’s pay for the death of the journalist they are now going to cut production on oil to hurt us. Maybe that’s why Trump was not pressing the issue.
3306 2018-12-13 18:05:28 I really thought my hair was the only hair that grew in dirt and oil 
3307 2018-12-13 18:05:15 For all the people that look at how prosperous Norway is from oil & ask why Ab isn’t. It’s because of the money we send Quebec and Canada. If you want us to be as prosperous as Norway, we can be...all we need to do is split from Canada. Canada needs us, we don’t need Canada.
3308 2018-12-13 18:04:42 Although we’d like to be able to tell every homeowner that the removal of their oil tank will be a quick process, we can’t do that until we know its exact location. If you aren’t sure where it is on your property, we’ll have to locate it before we can give you a better...
3309 2018-12-13 18:04:25 I could swear I heard similar music in Aquaman that was played in MoS while Clark was under water after rescuing the oil rig workers
3310 2018-12-13 18:04:24 Cut the garlic head in half, season and oil, wrap in foil. In the oven for 30-40 mins on 200 take out unwrap,.. leave to cool. Squeeze the garlic out of the skin and keeps a couple of weeks in the fridge in a covered box.
3311 2018-12-13 18:04:23 If you think so than why congress allowed private companies in telecom, oil sector, construction sector etc in their tenure.. Why didn't they support govt companies
3312 2018-12-13 18:04:20 She'll get one once she's deported.
3313 2018-12-13 18:04:16 อ่านแล้วไม่เข้าหัวไม่อ่านดีมั้ย
3314 2018-12-13 18:04:13 heavy short oil here $CL_F 51.90s, gonna try to swing this
3315 2018-12-13 18:04:06 Get my oil changed. Uncovers a fucking blown coolant seal and now your boi is out a car
3316 2018-12-13 18:04:06 FFS! Send the bill to our society as a whole!  Oil companies are just in business to supply a much sought after commodity that supports our leisure focused lifestyle. Without it, Whistler, and other mega resorts, wouldn’t exist.
3317 2018-12-13 18:04:02 4c natural hair not blown out or combed then full of oil & wanted only 4 braids . i just couldn't.
3318 2018-12-13 18:03:59 At his age? The man shall grow and die, then she marries another or stay a widow?
Every woman’s dream is to grow with her husband, in all terms. This is terrible.
3319 2018-12-13 18:03:51 oil? I get my batteries for 15 and do carts for 40 (.75g), so that seems expensive. although I've also heard of the super nice 1g carts going for 80 
3320 2018-12-13 18:03:11 No, i donnot. I hate makeup for what it does to most of the girls and women. Many of them are so beautiful naturally and then proceed to airbrush their face with crude oil and think it looks hot...
It's ugly most of the time. I mean cover some spots, but not this stuff...
3321 2018-12-13 18:03:09 Oh I would have tuned in but then I remembered, I would rather boil my head in oil than listen to your incessant lying!!
3322 2018-12-13 18:03:08 Like ethical oil or clean coal
3323 2018-12-13 18:02:54 They pulled the same BS at Interior. Even replaced the nature scenes with mines and oil fields. I'm not kidding.
3324 2018-12-13 18:02:48 Surely as oil/gas is reserved, only the UK Gov will have the trade figures, where else would Scot gov get figures to use within their methodology?
3325 2018-12-13 18:02:47 And citation needed on the finite resource? Is this a peak oil argument?
3326 2018-12-13 18:02:31 If anyone wants to take a ride on a yacht, I have a good friend in the oil business that owns a very very large one. #ithas8engines
3327 2018-12-13 18:02:03 Feels like shorts trying to push something but the market doesn't buy it. Oil, Asian markets, FTSE all up on the week. Seems to be a lot of pressure to the upside. At some point they gotta realize 2580 isn't getting tested again this week and it bounces
3328 2018-12-13 18:01:56 Omg i needed a small cup to put my klairs oil but i didnt know where to find one so.......... i took my mom’s ikea tupperware  ma if u realize smth missing its not me
3329 2018-12-13 18:01:51 Rt: @elonmusk: the oil business is one that needs to go away as quickly as possible in order for us to preserve this planet.
3330 2018-12-13 18:01:41 El cabron este ofreció pasarme baby oil por los pies sin conocerme, ahora el mmb a diario me pregunta que como va mi día, mis ganas de hacerlo sentir mal están en 1000

3334 2018-12-13 18:01:19 No

It's a tax on Government inefficiency and ineptitude 

10 new modular refinaries could be built in 3 years ...eliminating Subsidies on imported PMS

Nigeria could have massively exported soybeans to China to replace crude oil.

Buhari failed in both
3335 2018-12-13 18:01:00 I’m half Jewish/ half Christian by background & the Christian half on balance are wealthier than my Jewish half! They were heavy in the oil/gas industry in Texas! Alas no billionaires on either side just mostly middle class some a bit higher some lower! Loved them all!

Mine is white angelica 
3341 2018-12-13 18:00:02 Ladies, if your man:

- is a plant
- is an oil refinery
- is related to rafinerija
- is a sugar refinery

He's not your man. He's a refinery.
3342 2018-12-13 17:59:59 Ok ok. Because I’ve been using aloe Vera and coconut oil and nothing that’s not even working. Starting to think my skin just sensitive
3343 2018-12-13 17:59:47 I love the peter Thomas Roth pumpkin enzyme mask for getting rid of scars. I do it in the shower after face wash. I tone with witch hazel/rose water from thayers & moisturize with rose hip oil. I know it sounds like a lot. I have really oily skin BUT the oil absorbs really well
3344 2018-12-13 17:59:44 tea tree oil got my beard glistening 
3345 2018-12-13 17:59:23 TO BE CLEAR - US is world's largest oil exporter just now. The Saudi effect is small, since we get most from Canada and Mexico - if at all. 
This is overstatement of Saudi effect.
3346 2018-12-13 17:59:14 What's the evidence of being 'polished' in him?
3347 2018-12-13 17:59:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love live in like...
3348 2018-12-13 17:59:07 Getting an oil change at local dodge dealership. In the waiting room their TV was on CNN or so I thought. THEN,  I realized, it was set on Fox News Neil Cavuto.  Every guest he attempted to solicit a negative response to blame POTUS Trump for ALL the ills in the world. Fox/CNN?
3349 2018-12-13 17:59:05 Dare you to come to Alberta and say that in front of the unemployed oil and gas workers. You want transition but your government offers little real world solutions in any sort of time frame relevant to the suffering. Air is pretty thin sitting up in your high chairs.
3350 2018-12-13 17:59:00 Hmmm...If "England" can't survive without "Scottish oil", then how is it that UK still exists, given that the value of "Scottish oil" to the Exchequer was actually negative for several consecutive quarters from 201-2017?
3351 2018-12-13 17:59:00 I'm taking orders for my next CBD Hemp Oil shipment before Christmas. Let me know if you'd like me to add something to the order for you.

We now have Pet Treats.
3352 2018-12-13 17:58:59 i stay traveling everywhere but haven’t checked my oil once :(
3353 2018-12-13 17:58:57 ... all the citizens, whilst completely letting industry off the hook and continuing to invest in destruction of earth's ecosystems. Oil & gas is much less of an environmental concern compared to geoengineering. Pumping millions of tonnes of heavy metals into our atmosphere.
3354 2018-12-13 17:58:50 We could make CBD oil from it
Supposedly one cannot get high from Cannabidiol
3355 2018-12-13 17:58:50 I have oil in my backyard 
3356 2018-12-13 17:58:31 Right. He said he would:

- cancel Iran deal
- improve the economy
- reduce dependency of foreign oil
- lower taxes
- bring NK to the table
- improve our military

Funny how he's done all that in a matter of two years. But, hey, live in your hate bubble. It's safer in there.
3357 2018-12-13 17:58:12 Castor oil is really essential
3358 2018-12-13 17:58:09 oh and COCONUT OIL
3359 2018-12-13 17:58:04 Hi Cory! I was doing some reading today.  It came to my attention that you got lots of $$$ from Koch Industries, oil and gas companies and 300.000 from the NRA, which worked with Russian spies to manipulate American policy towards Russia. Will you be returning any of this money?
3360 2018-12-13 17:58:01 Of course, climate scientists do work for oil companies, that's why oil companies are investing hundreds of millions in projects to take advantage of the artic opening up.
3361 2018-12-13 17:58:01 And does QC not have pipelines already for imported foreign oil? They don't want Alberta oil in their pipelines. Not all oil from AB comes from the oil sands. There is a huge oil well industry also. I worked at a site many years ago.
3362 2018-12-13 17:58:01 I should’ve stuck to the oil change instead of them doing my whee alignment I could’ve saved that for next week it’s already free smh
3363 2018-12-13 17:57:53 じゃあそのプランでいくか
3364 2018-12-13 17:57:50 Coal and oil are just as “natural” as gas. 

Why is only gas called “natural gas”?
3365 2018-12-13 17:57:50 Love horoscopes but very strong negative feelings about the American essential oil industrial complex
3366 2018-12-13 17:57:40 This may be a life hack for you girls if you wanna keep your curls in after you curled your hair but brush it out before you go to bed, add some oil, and braid your hair they’ll be bouncy and soft in the morning
3367 2018-12-13 17:57:37 That's a bigger gap than I thought, but that TU will happily go to 6k + provided the linkages on the BE3 aren't hashed (they often are because no-one's ever done the oil). I imagine an equivalent 1400 R8 would be 12-13 seconds because of the extra grunt.
3368 2018-12-13 17:57:35 What I am saying is that FI cherry picks data to misrepresent  & denigrate science to take heat of oil business . There are tons of green energy success stories right across the world . FI is a Corp propaganda tank that looks for anything to further their agenda.
3369 2018-12-13 17:57:32 Apparently it’s impossible to find massage oil in London
3370 2018-12-13 17:57:31 Brilliant, total burn.

Of course, no woman would ever make such an appalling comment about a male MP & no disrespect to your male colleagues but I suspect plenty of fodder there. And that's coming from me, I'm no oil painting.
3371 2018-12-13 17:57:30 and you plastic glory hunters starts the brigade? you wish he wasn’t here. guess what? he is and he wil send cheating oil money clubs like you to where you belong,second devision.  btw, learn to fill a stadium with all the oil money and FFP cheating at least.

3376 2018-12-13 17:57:15 @TeamCavuto the oil price is nearing the danger level for the Fracking group....DJT has assisted in lowering the price of crude but I feel sure he would want to support the price to keep crude fracked oil flowing.
3377 2018-12-13 17:57:10 We r stuck in cycle since Egypt wherein inheritance of what was intended to facilitate trade has defined future freedom and opportunity and privileges within society. Any tips on changing the landscape of that? (Incentive: end oil money power halt global warming.)

3388 2018-12-13 17:55:54 I really like this pun and don't want to ruin it but IIRC oil makes up about 1/3 of the Mexican government's revenue, so it's already a pedrostate

3400 2018-12-13 17:54:50 Finally got an oil change 
3401 2018-12-13 17:54:49 Also if you all are still in town and like fancy olive oil, check out Il Fiorello. They’re open 1-5. It’s about a 10 minute drive from Jelly Belly
3402 2018-12-13 17:54:49 Didn’t we all?
3403 2018-12-13 17:54:43 Its kind of like oil in a car engine. There is a proper level for optimal function. If you have too little, it can cause problems. If you have too much, that's a problem too.

3407 2018-12-13 17:54:12 Of course we had a choice - but blew it.

Norway like many oil countries set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund with its North Sea Oil cash which pays for pension and social care for its investments.

Mrs Thatcher blew ours - plus all the cash from privatisations - paying bills. Shame.

You need Coconut Oil. Lots of it. You can do with pure coconut oil or if the smell is strange, mix equal parts coconut oil and hair +
3418 2018-12-13 17:53:08 I think it's poetic that the spoils of the oil wars are the main ingredient in our climate change disaster.

3430 2018-12-13 17:51:55  just checked yours
3431 2018-12-13 17:51:51 That's still a form of taxation, Chuck. Point is, your state charges oil corps 35% to do business in the state. That aspect seems like a liberal-progressive goal, no? I mean what sort of conservative/libertarian does that to corporations?
3432 2018-12-13 17:51:43 You could say housing too. However, housing, and retail can, somewhat, roll up under banking strength through credit. Which seems to me you could also roll oil into transport.
3433 2018-12-13 17:51:40 She should switch to Oil of Olay.
3434 2018-12-13 17:51:32 Lo único que no soporto de todo esto es que se hagan a los soprendidos. "López resultó autoritario, ay a poco."
3435 2018-12-13 17:51:32 What I do is when I’m going in a bath, I just put it straight onto my dry hair and literally soak it in the coconut oil! It drips a lot so that’s why I like doing it in the bath haha, - I’ve never done it on wet hair but I reckon it would work the same!
3436 2018-12-13 17:51:27 My husband literally just left to go buy some CBD oil about 10 mins ago. I’m anxious about trying it but he’s not medicated right now, so he’s excited to try something that’s not an amphetamine
3437 2018-12-13 17:51:26 Did your washer break, roof leak, car needs an oil change you can’t afford? No worries. You can now earn a fortune working from your own home. Simply write and post articles on social media using Melania Trump’s name. That’s all it takes to get filthy rich.

3450 2018-12-13 17:50:24 Oil has way more to lose. Auto companies can pivot to more efficient cars or EVs.

3452 2018-12-13 17:50:11 GorT: different era. I learned and did change brakes, tires, oil, brake fluid, etc.
3453 2018-12-13 17:50:10 Hmmm. I bet oil money is one of them.
3454 2018-12-13 17:49:57 Why are companies in foodstuff not opening up their own outlets but sell through others costing middlemen costs to end consumers?

3463 2018-12-13 17:49:04 So we shouldn't even try for some clean, CO2 hungry hemp clothing? Hempcrete? Meds? Cooking oil?  We should just ignore and not use this miraculous substance god created?

I'll offer a couple of thoughts (and you are also welcome to send me email). 1. Do use different data sets, as needed...
3466 2018-12-13 17:48:59 Whatever helps But i can't help and wonder how much more support they would get if  The National President of @UniforTheUnion  Jerry Dias wasn't out protesting and destroying jobs in the oil and gas sector in Alberta & wasting members $$$$ when they need it now more than ever
3467 2018-12-13 17:48:58 The taxpayers always pay 100% of the costs. I’m guessing Saudi oil would pollute less?
3468 2018-12-13 17:48:50 Well, if Saudi Arabia is sanctioned it will just find other markets for its oil and buy Russian and Chinese weapons at lower costs. Instead of altering its behavior, it will likely triple down without the influence or input of the US- just as Turkey has been doing.

3481 2018-12-13 17:48:02 3. As for relieveing anxiety, citrus oils are great because they are uplifting. Bergamot is a personal favorite, but grapefruit is great as well. Mixing a few drops with a carrier oil (like coconut oil or olive oil) and putting on your chest/wrists/and under your feet.

3509 2018-12-13 17:45:54 Yes (at least released publicly by a government agency). Oil traders do their own private assessments, at times daily, in multiple locations (and a few consultants offer similar services). I won't say it's the only driver, but a key driver for sure.

3511 2018-12-13 17:45:42 it's messy over there and can be hard to follow but the basic facts are the US been engaged in endless wars for oil profits & global dominance this whole century & not only are we responsible for the existence of isis and al qaeda, we are actively helping those groups right now
3512 2018-12-13 17:45:31 this year for Xmas Im asking for fish oil and vitamin D pills 
3513 2018-12-13 17:45:24 I'm not trying to be dramatic, it was almost entirely bread. I even drove back to ask for more vinegar... which they don't apparently have, they only have a vinegar and oil mix... so there you go. #NeverAgainWilson
3514 2018-12-13 17:45:23 Ok so I’m getting a pedicure with my mom and they are doing this thing where they are soaking my feet in orange oil to make them smell like oranges 
3515 2018-12-13 17:45:13 The 24-mo. rolling correlation between Crude Oil and Corn (-0.31) has entered a low correlation phase. #Energy
3516 2018-12-13 17:45:12 Straight Coconut oil doesn’t belong on your face. Idc idc idc. It’s trash.
3517 2018-12-13 17:45:07 Vitamin E and coconut oil works well
3518 2018-12-13 17:45:06 @TheRealDaytime The other day Hill Harper was on your show & introduced his body oil. Can you please provide me with info as to where I can purchase this.
Thanks

3520 2018-12-13 17:45:04 Actually the state gets money from royalties for the companies using the land to drill for oil. No state tax is awesome. Most of the state does not have a sales tax. Gas tax is $.08 per gallon.
3521 2018-12-13 17:45:04 Ottawa doesn't set prices or control inventory or encourage the worldwide oil glut. 
So they didn't do "this" to us.

Ottawa can increase EI dates, buy a pipeline, support the AB premier - they have done those things.
3522 2018-12-13 17:45:02 Please don't tell us he's gonna pull a Reagan and go with insanity as a defense.
3523 2018-12-13 17:45:01 Also know that some cats have a negative reaction to the meds - my cat did and it was a very stressful trip for him and me.  I like the idea of cbd oil.
3524 2018-12-13 17:44:51 More than enough in zaria. U can buy 300 t&p, blend 50, spice 50, onion 100, meat 400 &  oil 100.
3525 2018-12-13 17:43:55 hey Jav, the only real inventory data monitored weekly is the US right?  so the main driver of global oil prices is US inventory data (which is highly suspect). is that a fair statement?
3526 2018-12-13 17:43:54 He looks kinda silly and small lounging with a microphone in that enormous leather chair, a teenager playing a role, almost completely unconscious, drawling on about oil, seeking applause; ludicrous, much like those who still worship him without any real regard to substance
3527 2018-12-13 17:43:54 Dear Lord, I would hope she would lose.  Democratic socialism has been recently tried in Venezuela which has epic oil reserves and should be a top economy.  Instead they are dying.  Also, she isn’t in office yet and already threatening political opponents with powers of office.
3528 2018-12-13 17:43:47 Lmao coconut oil solves All
3529 2018-12-13 17:43:41 The Witcher:
It was a snowy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  Botchlings. 'Use Cursed Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
3530 2018-12-13 17:43:31 Yes, and subsidize oil co, too
3531 2018-12-13 17:43:28 Well,have you ever known of ocean Oil spills& refinery explosion deaths

What if someone told you:
"Its your fault"

Look-You can play your Blame game all day long&not get anything done. No gains.

But im playing my game-doing what i can with actions to give back to Earth. Gains.
3532 2018-12-13 17:43:28 Believing a known snake oil salesmen that even @JackPosobiec is starting to waver from
3533 2018-12-13 17:43:13 For my birthday my parents bought me two new tires, a new battery, took my car for an oil change/ tire alignment AND got me new brakes.
3534 2018-12-13 17:43:08 Scheduled my oil change 
3535 2018-12-13 17:42:33 Google Earth check out the desert around the village of Malaga NM. And tell me about protecting our landscape

Almost all the animals are gone, there habitats destroyed by the oil fields. Antalope, Deer, rabbits, quail, gone very few left. Ducks and Dove migration routes changed.
3536 2018-12-13 17:42:24 Using a quality beard oil and washing it 2-3x/week with a beard- specific shampoo will also help a lot bc it moisturizes and exfoliates the skin under the beard and will reduce an itchiness/flakes during the growth process
3537 2018-12-13 17:42:22 I need a hot oil treatment 
3538 2018-12-13 17:42:17 You can end at alcohol and prescription drugs effects the ability to drive. CBd oil is just a side note
3539 2018-12-13 17:42:11 Lawn mowers require regular maintenance during each season, including draining all gasoline and oil at the end of the season to prepare for storage during the winter. Ask about maintenance services when you buy your lawnmower.
3540 2018-12-13 17:42:07 I can't relate because Hyung is single, the only boyfriend I had is dead because Hyung fried it with oil and eat it later— yes, it's chicken
3541 2018-12-13 17:42:00 Could this be the reason for Saudis to start to diversify to nuclear power plants etc... To gradually prepare for the time when oil is NOT anymore significant source of income to the state?
3542 2018-12-13 17:41:57 Somebody said depression is a choice not a an mental illness  Ima just smell my lemon essential oil and keep my comment to myself 
3543 2018-12-13 17:41:55 En el #DiaDelPetroleo quiero rendir homenaje a mi tatarabuelo, el Ing Huergo, primer presidente de Dirección General de Explotación de Petróleo de C. Rivadavia, precursora de YPF. Sobre todo x ser un defensor de los intereses nacionales enfrentandose nada menos q a la Standar Oil
3544 2018-12-13 17:41:51 Arsenal have no oil money. We still won trophies... even in 2017 when we are poor and in transition.
3545 2018-12-13 17:41:48 Probably trim it and use conditioner if you don’t already? There’s also like oil treatments you can get that work really well.
3546 2018-12-13 17:41:42 Man I miss my hands being dirty with oil and shit ahaha I love this shit cars is my shit!
3547 2018-12-13 17:41:38 Try some CBD oil for your migraines
3548 2018-12-13 17:41:34 I swear I only need my oil changed once a year lol every time I take it they say it don’t even be dirty I’ve only gotten my oil changed like 4 times 
3549 2018-12-13 17:41:26 Waiting for my car to get detailed and an oil change and I’m so impatient it’s been three damn hours
3550 2018-12-13 17:41:11 The lotus finally dumped it's oil?
3551 2018-12-13 17:41:06 Oh no the oil prices will rise!!
3552 2018-12-13 17:41:01 I've had great results with vitamin c oil for hyper pigmentation on my face and body
3553 2018-12-13 17:41:00 North dakota has no issues buying the tools needed to take the oil out.. there are sanctions against Venezuela that makes impossible to buy a single drill. Because Venezuela does not produce drills..
3554 2018-12-13 17:40:58 Best off with an oil tho, can't speak to 'drinks'
3555 2018-12-13 17:40:47 Oil dey your head nnam!
3556 2018-12-13 17:40:43 And we need to keep eyes on Russian Arctic exploitation.  US exploitation not so much. Only oil co to get drilling permit in ANWR area failed becase the drilling platform was designed to anchor to thick, old sea ice. Not enough of it any more.
3557 2018-12-13 17:40:36 Which of these is there a Flintstones or essential oil shield for?
3558 2018-12-13 17:40:35 Extraordinary that provinces without oil and long established manufacturing centres can't seem to catch up in incomes. Wonder why that is.
3559 2018-12-13 17:40:33 OK I need a plug in #atlanta who sells thc oil cartilages SOMEONE HELP ME OUT #replytweet

3561 2018-12-13 17:40:23 @wholeearthfoods have you changed the recipe for the regular crunch peanut butter. It seems very oily, keep having to pour oil away.
3562 2018-12-13 17:40:10 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
3563 2018-12-13 17:40:04 Oil is here to stay.
3564 2018-12-13 17:40:03 Wow that’s pretty petty! Especially since how much the world is losing with the environmental impact from oil.
3565 2018-12-13 17:39:56 You can honestly say that - for instance - the oil price crashing as it did would have prompted SNP to hold another ref had they won IndyRef1? Truthfully?
3566 2018-12-13 17:39:55 this step is only to make funds buy oil and keep it high..like they did for 1 and half years.. they buy EIA data
3567 2018-12-13 17:39:53 if you do you better oil the shit out of your hair
3568 2018-12-13 17:39:48 ひゃぁ……じゃあ…えっす～～～!!!!(〃▽〃)
3569 2018-12-13 17:39:37 Looks like an oil painting
3570 2018-12-13 17:39:35 baby oil and a q tip to rub them off
3571 2018-12-13 17:39:24 Girls who know how to change their own oil are so fucking annoying. Calm down, girlfriend. Ain’t nobody putting a ring on your dirty ass finger no faster than they are on anybody else’s.
3572 2018-12-13 17:39:20 Be very careful about sustainable palm oil as well. Sometimes sustainable palm oil is just as bad, if not worse, as non-sustainable
3573 2018-12-13 17:38:57 Heavy whipping cream, butter, MCT oil, bitch! That’s bullet proof #BulletProofCoffee
3574 2018-12-13 17:38:53 That’s like trying to mix oil and water
3575 2018-12-13 17:38:48 Setelah dikaji, kulit aku tak boleh go dengan seed oil.. mengelupas  dem it
3576 2018-12-13 17:38:38 Oil price Ko government k under Dalo or subsidy do.

Kisan want high because they invest high due to oil price
3577 2018-12-13 17:38:29 Cobalt turquoise light, I'm guessing cobalt is mad expensive. For 37ml oil paint it's £20.20 and for a smallish tub of acrylic it's £40! 
3578 2018-12-13 17:38:26 Solution to extra oil export tankers is to close coal mines #bcpoli
3579 2018-12-13 17:38:19 Coman kneel down lemme pray for you, remember to bring your anointing  oil...
3580 2018-12-13 17:38:07 Two words. Baby oil.
3581 2018-12-13 17:37:58 Oh thought it was about crude oil. But yep if crude oil and products, net exporter. 
3582 2018-12-13 17:37:57 With my dark hair I used cocoa and baking soda. With blonde hair you can use corn starch, baking soda and an essential oil. Super easy!
3583 2018-12-13 17:37:51 The kind of die-on-this-hill, my-favorite-is-better-than-everyone-else stuff is so stupid, but it's also the oil that keeps Twitter humming along.
3584 2018-12-13 17:37:33 They don't blame the oil industry for lost jobs, they blame the government.
3585 2018-12-13 17:37:31 Rosemary with another carrier oil will make it grow.
3586 2018-12-13 17:37:29 Climate scientists would make more money working for oil companies denying climate science.
3587 2018-12-13 17:37:21 Para mi tiene que jugársela fuel oil y abrir el finde
3588 2018-12-13 17:37:15 WOW! If I was the person in charge of the taps to turn oil heading to BC on/off, I would be so tempted to turn it off.
3589 2018-12-13 17:36:53 Don't let the door hit you in the ass.
3590 2018-12-13 17:36:53 Forget shea butter and coconut oil. Black soap is magic for a lot of stuff. Just sayin...
3591 2018-12-13 17:36:32 And save and use the olive oil. Its garlic flavored
3592 2018-12-13 17:36:31 Why not, it’s an honest question, all Canadian oil right?  What’s the problem?
3593 2018-12-13 17:36:26 This peppermint and orange in my oil diffuser is really clearing up my lungs and putting me in a good mood (:
3594 2018-12-13 17:36:21 Alberta is diversifying because there's finally a government pushing it. Thankfully. Yes the O&G sector is important, like 9% of our GDP but alberta isn't the ONLY producer and oil is the ONLY energy product. Alberta will be detroit if this fixation on oil and only oil sustains
3595 2018-12-13 17:36:17 Man you sure slathered the baby oil on thick today. Shiny.
3596 2018-12-13 17:36:15 We (or at least I do) also believe in Canadian oil and gas. #buildthepipeline
3597 2018-12-13 17:36:08 Putin's plan will ruin that by pumping as much oil as possible to stuff his pockets and keep the Russian petrostate afloat.
3598 2018-12-13 17:35:57 But where does one go from here? I've been in the IT field since 2005. Prior to that I worked for Allstate and before that was Walmart (shout out to the oil change dept). But man, the money in IT is really good. That is really the only thing keeping me in this field.
3599 2018-12-13 17:35:55 3) We were approached by the UK government and the oil companies to help overthrow the government of Iran and install a more pliable leader (the Shah). It worked the Shah was crowned King of Iran, he became a willing participant and the rest is history.
3600 2018-12-13 17:35:45 What kind of love can she possibly have at 15. Go to the mirror, the person you see there is mad.
3601 2018-12-13 17:35:41 War is hell. In WWII Germany used V-missiles to terrorize civilians in London,etc, killing ~18K. Allies often bombed Hamburg's shipyards,oil refineries. Last raid after hot,dry weather firestorm killing 42.6 K. U.S. A-bombs on Hiroshima/Nagasaki killed 129-226K mainly civilians
3602 2018-12-13 17:35:30 Next time you go on tv use a moisturiser that combats oil because your forehead nearly blinded me.
3603 2018-12-13 17:35:27 Definitely loving your eyeliner wings but that’s not what you’re asking about  I mean I have naturally wavy hair and I straighten mine most days but even on days I don’t I use the Bleach London Hair Elixer oil. I find it protects against the cold and helps to keep it tame. 
3604 2018-12-13 17:35:25 The @HarviestounBrew Old Engine Oil was pretty good today as well.  Look forward to seeing something on the other tap! @CAMRA_Edinburgh
3605 2018-12-13 17:35:22 The U.N.  Stopped being neutral at the beginning of food. For. Oil.  Lot of people from the U.N.  Got. Rich off of it.
3606 2018-12-13 17:35:19 Ok, My oil runs hot on this. But I think I just dislocated my shoulder watching this.
3607 2018-12-13 17:35:19 Not entirely true, some taxes are collected in USD but Oil taxes and VAT from customs services are based on dollar values.
3608 2018-12-13 17:35:14 As a Venezuelan, I'd go further back. We had dem socialism (free health, education, housing/social services, etc) for 40yrs before Chávez. His job was to (1) expand it, and (2) use oil $$ to prepare for crisis. He only kind-of did (1), neglected (2), enabled widespread corruption
3609 2018-12-13 17:34:55 Last job i had we made garlic confit. You put a couple handfuls of garlic cloves, skin off, in a pan, cover cloves in olive oil and cook on low heat about 30min, until the inside of the clove spreads like butter. Its like garlic candy
3610 2018-12-13 17:34:36 Would they be endorsing a particular of fish sauce / olive oil?
3611 2018-12-13 17:34:27 Good...coal is extremely important as is oil...poor leadership, poor ideals and non-Canadian values is the problem!
3612 2018-12-13 17:34:26 I ran out of wild growth oil I’m SICK
3613 2018-12-13 17:34:21 literally your only legit options though & I’d use neem oil with either of the other 2. it’s a spermicide. I suggest taking a NFP class if that’s the route you wanna take, bc it’s only reliable if you know what you’re doing. it requires temping & tracking CM.
3614 2018-12-13 17:33:58 i always do this thing where I put too much oil in my hair but by the next day let me tell you... perfect
3615 2018-12-13 17:33:47 It's also crazy how much we used to rely on whale blubber for its oil. It was used in EVERYTHING.
3616 2018-12-13 17:33:41 lmao republicans have started many pointless wars that have killed innocent lives, including our own. How much $ we have wasted that could have went to the ppl but their money hungry desire for oil is reckless and dangerous.
3617 2018-12-13 17:33:37 Just oil and grease.
3618 2018-12-13 17:33:34 Oil and coal get way more kick backs, and are guilty of using the green energy they fight against because it's undeniably better, easier to maintain, and now cheaper for NEW energy production and still dropping.  Coal especially hasn't advanced in tech advancements in 40yrs.
3619 2018-12-13 17:33:28 What would Ottawa's motivation be to build a pipeline for oil it would no longer have rights to?
3620 2018-12-13 17:33:18 finally got my oil changed and it feels sooooo good 
3621 2018-12-13 17:33:15 How much is oil?!
3622 2018-12-13 17:33:06 Trading euroFX, oil, SP/ Nas at the CME globex platform....the moves are insane
3623 2018-12-13 17:33:01 So when do oil and energy companies start fixing the climate? That has to be in the deal right? Destroy the world for awhile than one must fix it for awhile..
3624 2018-12-13 17:32:58 No country is going to stop using Oil 100%. Here is why, Oil is the chemistry building block for 1000's of essential products for building things essential to human life. Be rational, Be realistic. 100% of anything is irrational, unrealistic. Be pro-common-sense.
3625 2018-12-13 17:32:54 Oil prices edge up on hopes global supplies will tighten

3628 2018-12-13 17:32:32 Another interesting detail which you didn't include is that oil taxes (47% in 2018) and Customs VAT which are earned in USD were converted to Naira at $1=158 Naira in 2012 but in 2018, that same $1=305.

Not taking away the progress FIRS has made in non-oil collection

3630 2018-12-13 17:32:30 It absorbs toxins and heavy metals in the soil, just like a sponge. That's why they planted it around Chernobyl. But using it to make CBD oil or hemp oil makes them susceptible to the poisons the hemp plants have absorbed.  Puts medical marijuana patients at risk for toxins.

3634 2018-12-13 17:31:52 Isn’t this Canada’s oil and not just Alberta’s as all of Canada benefits from it? Stopping the flow of Canadian oil is going to do nothing to change the environment, other than the political one, so let’s not chop our nose off to spite our face.

3639 2018-12-13 17:31:27 So alberta has a backlog, hence why notley has demanded a production decline. Refineries were shut down, including the largest buyer of our oil and oh also the sulpher content is high so it won't meet certain future standards. So why is alberta a victim? Because business.
3640 2018-12-13 17:31:11 2007 We all in Oxnard CA stopped BHP Billiton from plunking a three titted LNG depot right in the middle of the Santa Barbara Channel from which the environmental movement was born after a devastating oil spill in the 60s. Keep active because it works.

3644 2018-12-13 17:30:48 Will this be the same if we get independence or as I think we will be more heavily taxed to pay for independence and also it is their main revenue stream since North Sea oil is no there now
3645 2018-12-13 17:30:46 Jason this argument is tired. Clearly you need oil to dive and fly. The point is to move on from that.  Jesus get a better talking point
3646 2018-12-13 17:30:45 He just needs to put a little coconut oil and lemon on it should be good to go
3647 2018-12-13 17:30:41 2) He saw that the foreign oil companies kept the lion's share of the profits and believed all Iranians should have a share of  this wealth as well, think how Alaska shares their oil revenue. That was not acceptable to the oil companies, the Iranians asked the U.S. to arbitrate.

3650 2018-12-13 17:30:14 Coal is also a sedimentary deposit. And WV it is def in the Marcellus zone. Much more natural gas than oil, however.
3651 2018-12-13 17:30:13 Conservatives really need to pick a side. Either Muslims are cool because they give oil and buy weapons or they’re dangerous terrorist. #2facedbitches
3652 2018-12-13 17:30:06 girl I’m at the shop getting an oil change lol i think they almost done i hope
3653 2018-12-13 17:30:06 Exactly.
And it wouldn't actually extricate the US from the ME. The world's too connected, and many decades of involvement have created deep ties at many levels. Terrorism, oil, Israel, etc. America's involved, whether it wants to be or not. So the question is how best to do it.
3654 2018-12-13 17:30:03 Can we give pitchforks to oil and gas workers and give them your address?

Loving the silence from all pearl clutchers that were mad about people calling for violence.

3655 2018-12-13 17:29:57 Loving @TheCurrentCBC  this morning.  Discussing initiatives to address climate change. Yes - the oil and gas industry should be part of the solutions #energyfutureslab Yes - @JustinTrudeau is implementing good policy. Thank you for a balanced & realistic conversation (finally)

3658 2018-12-13 17:29:37 It’s so sad, we are slowly going back to Jahiliyyah period if we can doubt the Hadith of Prophet Muhammad SAW and still feel its normal.
3659 2018-12-13 17:29:36 FYI Andy Hall will be on Bbg at 1pm today to talk oil maybe something maybe nothing
3660 2018-12-13 17:29:32 Creo q la guerra del oil entre USA y el resto preocupa mas q un nivel dado de precios. Y la vuelta de las retenciones muestra q la voracidad está intacta. Hoy 4 dolares, y mañana con el desarrollo?
3661 2018-12-13 17:29:15 いや、こんなに直前になって研究発表の準備して焦ってるの、どう考えても自分のリスケが下手なせいなんだけど、睡眠不足に関しては例のjdのいびきが大きく関与しててそれに対しては少しヘイトが溜まってる
3662 2018-12-13 17:29:05 Yup. It’s called the Green River Formation. It possesses an absurd amount of oil.
3663 2018-12-13 17:28:58 Officially trying out coconut oil pulling. It feels fuckin weird pulling a spoonful of oil in your mouth and not immediately spitting it out
3664 2018-12-13 17:28:55 Back when I got my Ralph cheque I told ppl this was going to be bad. 1 day the oil market will drop & Alberta will be in trouble. Suggested we take the money & invest it like Norway. If only people had listened then we wouldn’t be in the mess. Maybe ppl should listen to me more.

3669 2018-12-13 17:28:46 Anyone have any Cleanser Recommendations? I’m extremely oily in my T-Zone and Extremely Dry on the perimeter of my face. 

I loved the GlamGlow Cleanser before they reformulated and I am currently using Olehenrickson oil control cleanser but it strips to much of my natural oils!
3670 2018-12-13 17:28:45 I thought you guys wanted to create jobs and leave behind the countries we are unfairly treated by?  As of now green energy employs more Americans, then coal has in over 40 years. A big excuse for our presence in the mid East is to protect our foreign oil supply.
3671 2018-12-13 17:28:42 As far as I know, the "merge" concept does not exist in Java. Am I wrong ?
I'd be interested in the way to install SEVERAL industry solutions (i.e Oil&Gas plus Nuc). How to do in such case ? What classes must be pointed in a_customer.xml ? Core Psdi? Nuc? Oil&Gas?
3672 2018-12-13 17:28:35 It was worse in the Seventies.  This happens when Albertans feel their oil income threatened. People sacrificed to come work in camps and when the East needed help back then, westerners actually had bumper stickers on cars 'Let Them Freeze In The Dark!'.
People have memories.
3673 2018-12-13 17:28:29 Trump deserves to be “gassed” for doing this.  Meanwhile....the ppl are paying dearly for the floods, fires & hurricane destruction while the oil companies get richer!  Despicable!

3676 2018-12-13 17:28:18 Common sense to change your oil or repair a leaky roof.
Balance a check book, count change with out a computer, I could go on for a long time with lists of things.
3677 2018-12-13 17:28:17 Our economy is ok by some measures, but others like the stk market are pointing to a downturn. NK is building new nucl. arms facilities. The "fully energy independent" is a pipe dream. If S. Arabia cut even 10% of their oil supplies tomorrow, the world would devolve into chaos.
3678 2018-12-13 17:28:16 Let's see...how about studying the issue, applying the scientific method, then diverting a reasonable amount to fund lowering emissions and converting to clean energy over time? ADDED BONUS - we remove ourselves from entanglements with oil producing countries. Win/win, right?

3682 2018-12-13 17:27:43 Why does the government need to bail out an industry that has self inflicted the wounds itself. The oil industry should have cut production when the price was falling, supply and demand, basic economics.
3683 2018-12-13 17:27:35 BREAKING: Saudi Arabia Targets U.S. With Sharp Oil Export Cut. Riyadh may lower exports to America close to a 30-year low, sources tell @JavierBlas & @tina_davis

Let’s nationalize the oil companies and shut down their propaganda machine.

3699 2018-12-13 17:26:38 Let's say (despite rapidly increasing global demand for coal, gas, and oil) that this 95%reduction is achieved someday, what difference would it make when our current contribution to global GHGs is 20 times less than that which is emitted from natural sources?

Education reduce poverty
3702 2018-12-13 17:26:24 little known fact, when you start your car in the morning youre actually supposed to just peg the gas to the floor in neutral. the high engine rpm helps the oil pump lubricate key engine components

3706 2018-12-13 17:26:01 Best part is when they start hitting, everyone will forget that was managers on purpose and just focus on the market being undersupplied because EIA heavily drives oil price sentiment, ironic enough
3707 2018-12-13 17:25:56 Why is palm oil not vegan if other foods such as soya are? Harvesting any such crop means killing huge numbers of wildlife, clearing land etc. Isn’t is speciesism to eat crops that involve the deaths of rodents and insects but not those that involve killing orangutans?

3782 2018-12-13 17:19:21 No they're not. And the US economy is not driven by oil production, but instead consumers, which would be bad for consumers if oil prices rises too drastically, but bad for economic growth in the long run if prices drop too drastically. Imo of course.
3783 2018-12-13 17:19:21 Or because it is snake oil and the cult like supporters keep on getting impressed by things such as VOIP.

3797 2018-12-13 17:18:12 @Acadien83 it has nothing to do with lasting forever. It has to do with the deliberate and purposeful destruction of the Oil and Gas Industry with harmful policies, taxation and delays that stopped all pipelines and investor confidence. This hurts all of Canada.

3920 2018-12-13 17:07:25 A1: Not sure if "currency" is the right word. But data is certainly more valuable than ever. Data is the oil of the 21st century; analytics is the engine. #idgtechtalk
3921 2018-12-13 17:07:17 But it is a common sentiment among people who remember that he, you know, murdered a girl, dismembered her and burned her in an oil drum in his backyard.
3922 2018-12-13 17:07:01 I propose that oil, gas and coal corporations be banned from future talks.
3923 2018-12-13 17:06:53 It’s because morons like you think that they actually did something to put that oil in the ground. Like it was Albertans own sweat and hard work that created the tar sands, not some fluke chance. And that in turn, means were the gate keepers of the future. Give your head a shake.
3924 2018-12-13 17:06:50 This is one of those case where they may need to pull out all the stops: tranquillisers, loud thumping music, strobe lights, body oil... really make an example of how this kind of behaviour should be tolerated.
3925 2018-12-13 17:06:48 @ClimatePsych WW2 style action to solve climate change? I’ve heard tons of crackpot theory’s to solve this non-existent problem but yours is by far the worst.  With out oil & fossil fuels we are going to be living in a modern day Stone Age.
3926 2018-12-13 17:06:46 It's effective as a marketing scheme, but hummus ingredients are not only chickpeas but also tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. You can add ingredients (like pine nuts or vegetables) but not subtract the essentials. Thus, your products are not hummus.
3927 2018-12-13 17:06:41 I did most of my research on late ‘70s New York, since oil trading took off at the NY Mercantile Exchange, not Chicago. Read lots of books on the period and the place, watched docs, and looked at old photos.
3928 2018-12-13 17:06:37 That and about 1 quart of Mobil Jet 2 every 2 hours vs .25 . GE vs RR oil consumption.
3929 2018-12-13 17:06:34 Glow oil you mean
3930 2018-12-13 17:06:33 min läkarmoster va så trött på alla häxdoktorer och naturlig snake oil så nu har hon startat ett en affär me naturlekemedel. pratade med mamma i tele idag o skillnaden är typ att hon säger a-vitamin istället för retinol lol

3934 2018-12-13 17:06:08 I’m saying in this brilliant spokespersons equation there is a missing 33% revenue from the dollar denominated oil. If naira was 500 they’d even be performing worse !!!
3935 2018-12-13 17:06:08 Niggas and honesty. Oil and water

3940 2018-12-13 17:05:40 Took my car to get an oil change and serviced and now I’m stranded in hillcrest for at least an hour. 
3941 2018-12-13 17:05:39 Coconut oil >
3942 2018-12-13 17:05:31 I can't believe Bio Oil is this scarce in Nigeria 
3943 2018-12-13 17:05:11 @jrlno2 there is a great plant dairy company who makes cheese that doesn’t use palm oil. The name is @MiyokosKitchen. I hope you could spread the word. Thank you.
3944 2018-12-13 17:04:57 @AntonyCosta if any of you guys are going into Newcastle tomorrow there’s a fab tapas restaurant called kaltur which is really healthy and run by 4 Spanish friends- olive oil alone is gorgeous!
3945 2018-12-13 17:04:50 I can't even see my boiled linseed oil without hearing that annoying guy in Avatar Day going "bOiled in Oil."

It's okay, though, simply because it's a James Hong voice.
3946 2018-12-13 17:04:47 Coconut oil and castor oil mix and leave it overnight than wash it out. Do it like 2x a week and u should be good
3947 2018-12-13 17:04:47 whether you believe climate change is real or not, doesnt matter to me.
for me its more about system change, to try 2 put pressure on our Gov to stop raping the earth for gas oil, stop fracking. adopt more sustainable ways to live so that we dont fuck up mother earth any more 1/2
3948 2018-12-13 17:04:43 Lol let's overlook,before them no even acknowledge, you know when you lie, you might not necessarily remember your lies. But the truth remains stick to the memory.
3949 2018-12-13 17:04:40 It’s happening. 87 bottle of beard growth oil. Give me a couple months 
3950 2018-12-13 17:04:35 Our stainless steel #nameplates are durable enough to withstand the harsh environments of the oil and gas industry.
3951 2018-12-13 17:04:33 ...so, you're about 30-min away from challenging the W.H. oil paintings to a staring contest...
3952 2018-12-13 17:04:28 “I’d rather you vote for an oil, fracking whore than a candidate who wants environmental change”.
3953 2018-12-13 17:03:56 If oil sands production is 5x dirtier (or more?) in terms of emissions than conventional production, how do you recommend we clean that up @dunk_steven?
3954 2018-12-13 17:03:39 still pumping for war so you can hide cowardly whilst you send innocent people to die for old technologies like oil, exports of arms sales, promotion of fear and oppression.... yeah happy birthday and risk dyng not for freedom but for $$$

3959 2018-12-13 17:02:49 What, no social license to be taxed for carbon usage?but have a social license to stop oil pipelines?
3960 2018-12-13 17:02:44 For once I agree with heritage.  Government has no business interfering in the market and subsiding oil production in the US.
3961 2018-12-13 17:02:39 and oil change.

3968 2018-12-13 17:02:09 Except the guppies will continue to say the reef is dying even though it’s not. Worse yet, YOU will be the “denier” if you claim the truth. When presented the truth, they will disparage the site and author. The scientists will be accused of being shills for “big oil”. Guaranteed!

3972 2018-12-13 17:01:44 It's all they have other than hate.
3973 2018-12-13 17:01:44 Uganda is facing headwinds over the set year 2020 production of crude oil, as investors- who will lay down the pipeline to port Tanga Tz- ask for a higher tariff from the capped $12.20 for transportation of the crude.
3974 2018-12-13 17:01:34 So, you're against BIG OIL & @NRA??

Given that you refuse to partake in any oil guzzling machine, I have an odd question; Do you ride a horse or a bike everywhere?

You do long trips via a wind glider or something??

@NRA advocates the Bill of Rights, legal gun ownership, wtf???

3979 2018-12-13 17:01:14 snake oil salesman Sturgeon should have wound her neck in on the no confidence vote, political posturing with that gambit, she should have known better.
3980 2018-12-13 17:01:07 It’s horrific! Language/reading/writing skills benefits from working on language/reading/writing, not clipping ties, omega 3 supplements, colored glasses or snake oil. Of course I would love a quick fix for my students who struggle, but that’s not realistisc.
3981 2018-12-13 17:00:58 who’d love for little spell bundle kits like a candle, anointing oil, and herb sachet?

  a) es racista, clasista y envidiosilla?
  b) Gibrán se está pasando de tueste en defender lo indefendible?
3992 2018-12-13 17:00:16 I ended up using Olive Oil and it worked 
3993 2018-12-13 17:00:14 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
3994 2018-12-13 17:00:10 Who is Willy Paul?
3995 2018-12-13 17:00:08 True but me to ye samjha raha tha ki oil prices badhane meter sirf pm ke pass nahi rehta.
3996 2018-12-13 16:59:31 How much Jamaican Black Castor Oil y’all put in your hair? I might be over doing it. 
3997 2018-12-13 16:59:31 It is true
And that is possible

But it still opens avenues for Alberta to get oil to tidewater

You asked
I answered 
3998 2018-12-13 16:59:25 The oil industry bankrolled Reagan so he would undo Carter's renewable energy initiatives. GHWB and GWB were both oilmen and had the goal of keeping oil as a major energy source.
3999 2018-12-13 16:59:20 Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides
4000 2018-12-13 16:59:05 How much did you buy your brake oil
4001 2018-12-13 16:59:01 Check out what FDR did in the middle of the Great Depression!  He taxed the rich and created the greatest recovery!  Created jobs .Can’t we learn from history? We are the richest country in the world!  End subsidies for oil companies & corporations that rob the workers.....
4002 2018-12-13 16:58:59 Broadly about 1/3rd of production is conventional (light or heavy) and 2/3rs Oilsands. The Oilsands number is roughly 50% mined or 1/3rd the aggregate that is bitumen. The other 50% of Oilsands or remaining 1/3rd of total is Insitu which is more heavy oil in terms of spec.
4003 2018-12-13 16:58:54 also dont forget tissues and probably baby oil
4004 2018-12-13 16:58:44 NEW!! We have some amazing new products here at the Arcola Co-op..... gate closers, horse and cow supplements and Hemp oil products for horses.. come take a look today.
4005 2018-12-13 16:58:35 ..and I'm a circle.
4006 2018-12-13 16:58:34 Yes! As my Twitter header states: " #Data is the new oil " I am a firm believer in this, the quality of any form/type of #DigitalTransformation is dependent upon the #data
4007 2018-12-13 16:58:30 Unfortunately, till we are independent of their oil and aid, every Pakistani Government will be forced to let them play with impunity.

4010 2018-12-13 16:58:22 Any day now the EXPLORATION well will put the skill and technology of this

4014 2018-12-13 16:57:17 @JoaquinCastrotx You want President Trump to prop up the Maduro Regime?? You want President Trump to remove Maduro?? You want President Trump to send economic aid/medical aid/ food aid, to help continue the Maduro regime with its oppression of the Venezuela? Restart their oil??
4015 2018-12-13 16:57:12 Your PARTY betrayed the young generation and you were complicit in that betrayal from 1979 onwards by destroying British industry and building London up by stealing the dividends from North Sea oil. You and your ilk have nothing to say I want to hear.
4016 2018-12-13 16:57:12 What Russia is trying to do is be the oil distributor to Europe with their pipeline that Reagan warned Europe against. But Europe being arrogant and terrible in economics, they allowed Russia's pipeline in for cheaper oil.

4019 2018-12-13 16:56:51 if the coconut oil is what is keeping your skin clear, weh done o
4020 2018-12-13 16:56:51 Oh yeah, once it’s a habit you wonder how people don’t do it. And I like to specify, I clean, soap and rinse the tack followed by a light condition. I only oil like once a month. If you over oil, or oil every ride, it mildly breaks down the leather in a bad way. Oil sparingly.
4021 2018-12-13 16:56:35 Need to decarbonize - wane off oil - faster the better. If u insist for a pipeline ok but use it for milk or whiskey - much less dangerous in case of spill.

4026 2018-12-13 16:56:04 omg I’ve been here an hour and I was the first customer like an oil change doesn’t take that long stupid hoes
4027 2018-12-13 16:55:58 I was an adult and got my oil changed almost three months ago and I didn’t really tell either of my parents because I pay for it anyway. And now my dad doesn’t fully believe that I got it changed

4030 2018-12-13 16:55:25 I make my own curry powders, but can’t be bothered making mayonnaise unless it’s for a home made tartare sauce. You can make hazelnut Mayonnaise if you use hazelnut oil although why you’d want to .....
4031 2018-12-13 16:55:06 This makes me laugh.  When the oil money machine see problems in Alberta, some people start screaming separation. Some aren't even from Alberta. It is stupid talk and diverts from issue at hand.
4032 2018-12-13 16:55:04 I’ll be Burning The Midnight Oil.
4033 2018-12-13 16:55:02 I wonder if @RachelNotley will be buying her fleet of oil trains from Bombardier. I think that would definitely send the wrong message.
4034 2018-12-13 16:55:00 @ryanjespersen hi Ryan. Why build a new refinery when the pipeline's, that love our oil, are at full capacity?
4035 2018-12-13 16:54:59 Alberta is starting with improved government regulation and incentives to make greener oil and gas.  Market our greener oil and gas to Asia advertising the positives over their dirty coal.  Regulation and resource management improves Alberta business not handicaps it.

4040 2018-12-13 16:54:29 Spent over $900 on Monday just finishing some of my Christmas shopping, spent $120 yesterday on more Christmas gifts, spending $900 on tires and getting my front end aligned tomorrow and still need brakes, rotors, struts and an oil change. I love adulting
4041 2018-12-13 16:54:23 "OPEC’s recent announcement of a cut in production suggests the desire to support oil prices in the low $60s, avoiding the very low levels of 2014, but not tightening markets enough that it causes more market share losses to shale." - PIMCO

4046 2018-12-13 16:54:00 There’s fewer women in STEM professions all around.  Who cares?  Really.  Part of being equal is that we can choose what we want to do.  I don’t see any articles about women being less than 15% of construction workers or oil workers.
4047 2018-12-13 16:54:00 Someone just made +15.37% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 51.539 → 51.935 (20x leverage)  ~ BIG BOY $WTICO $USD
4048 2018-12-13 16:53:57 Particularly speaking as someone who lived through both the oil boom and bust (albeit as a kid) and watched the entire city transform itself form a blue collar refinery town to a white collar energy trading and manufacturing city.
4049 2018-12-13 16:53:37 How about they turn themselves into oil like good dinosaurs should!?! #Vote2020 #DemocratsWillCRUSHtheGOPIn2020
4050 2018-12-13 16:53:37 Lmao my oil cost is $100 with a filter. The oil change was free as the shop is one of my customers and we trade out. If I did it myself I would have to pay for oil disposal.
4051 2018-12-13 16:53:34 World war 4 1989 April to continuous. March 1989 Sadam started burning the world's oil supply.
4052 2018-12-13 16:53:31 We are not fighting - Alberta oil companies are some of the biggest funders of renewables.  And world oil prices are not low.   Alberta prices are low due to lack of export capacity and targeted funding and campaigns from foreign funding.  Why is only Alberta/Canada targeted?

4055 2018-12-13 16:53:21 Yes but it is gov that regulates the industry. The same regulations around emissions, gender are not applied to imported oil. If they were, private businesses in the industry would adapt accordingly.
4056 2018-12-13 16:52:58 Al inherited a fortune from his oil co. owning dad. He’s a silver spoon goon!
4057 2018-12-13 16:52:55 The relation between lebanon and italy is way way far thousands of years ago #Phoenicians #sicilia i always heard that the italian are the lebanese of Europe and they do both like olive oil and pizza or mankouche  . Shame on  @matteosalvinimi
4058 2018-12-13 16:52:55 Empties are great for olive oil and balsamics.
4059 2018-12-13 16:52:54 Yes, both take bribes from oil and mining companies
4060 2018-12-13 16:52:44 Sautee 1 onion, about a 2-in piece of ginger and 4 garlic cloves in butter (sub olive oil to make vegan) until soft and fragrant. Add the mushy butternut squash and 4-ish cups of chicken or veggie stock. Simmer for 1 few minutes, then puree with an immersion blender or in batches
4061 2018-12-13 16:52:43 You need 8 small sausages,clove garlic, mashed,3 tablespoon olive oil,1large sweet onion, chopped I think,green pepper, chopped,2 large tomatoes also chopped,1cup uncooked parsley,1cup beef stock or bouillon can be used too if liked it more but it have to dissolved in hot water

4063 2018-12-13 16:52:26 If he'd made it himself he coulda cooked the spices in oil to release more flavour...cooled it off a bit then added to more oil to make mayo... in theory... anyroadup simply chucking curry powder into shop bought mayo is bear lazy.
4064 2018-12-13 16:52:21 Maybe he can be the only person to declare bankruptcy on an oil platform with his genius!

4067 2018-12-13 16:52:01 Maybe you can explain to American families why you're not supporting H.R. 2242, a ban on offshore drilling? Are you pro oil spill or just pro oil and gas industry money?
4068 2018-12-13 16:51:51 here you go... Even if the VP of this Government put all of its oil revenue in sharing #10,000 towards feeding the poor, a substantial portion of the population will remain poor... I rise
4069 2018-12-13 16:51:49 Fascinating read. What do you make of the hop brewers? Those who DONT use extract/oil? Also, totally jibes w/what the old brewer who started in the 1960s told me: cascade was supposed to be the American equivalent/take away the need for German imports...
4070 2018-12-13 16:51:40 @RaoulGMI loyal realvision subscriber here. What are your current thoughts on the direction of oil? I know you were short, took gains and then felt you did so too early. Does opec deal make you more bearish? Market reacted bullishly. I think overreaction, you?
4071 2018-12-13 16:51:38 Psalm 92:8
But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
Psalm 92:10
10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
4072 2018-12-13 16:51:18 Alberta the kindergarten province.    I love the way you characterize oil as Alberta's. News flash it's Canada's oil.
4073 2018-12-13 16:51:07 @realDonaldTrump admin’s plan for cars to emit more pollution has been covertly supported by US’s biggest oil refiner: Marathon Petroleum. Campaign to relax fuel efficiency standards has been conducted in Congress, on Facebook & in statehouses nationwide by oil-industry groups.
4074 2018-12-13 16:51:04 Grabbed some May '19 call options on $SLB. Strike $40. Paid $3.85. Oil turning around, this player at multi-yr lows. Should see a pop into yr end and Jan. Should be an easy 100% gainer.
4075 2018-12-13 16:51:02 @mspjh1 Yeah, we should only be subsidizing oil companies !!! I've been saying it for years... the oil companies need our help! Nice work, keep it up

4077 2018-12-13 16:50:40 Tried that, it's not very nice. It's completely non dairy, made of palm oil so doesn't taste like cream
4078 2018-12-13 16:50:33 You are aware it’s been almost thirty years since the Oil were relevant? So basically sit down and shut up. Enjoy the great players we got and unfollow Leafs Lunch. 06 was a miracle with a shit roster.
4079 2018-12-13 16:50:24 That was Iran's money dumbass! We seized it in 1979 when they revolted & removed our puppet government we used to control & profit off Iran's oil for decades. Obama simply gave back their own money when they agreed to dismantle their nuclear program & allow in weapons inspectors.
4080 2018-12-13 16:50:23 Please don’t touch me or my hair I’ll slap the oil out yo pores
4081 2018-12-13 16:50:14 First kitchen I found where there is no oil... hard to cook without oil!
4082 2018-12-13 16:49:44 Bitches always talking about helping somebody n won’t even help themselves to an oil change
4083 2018-12-13 16:49:41 Desperately need my oil changed lol. And still have to get the body work done on my car

4092 2018-12-13 16:48:49 Soak in oil, makes excellent bearing surface for that application
4093 2018-12-13 16:48:35 The only way to end this is to break off our twisted relationship w Saudi Arabia bc they r using Yemen as a proxy war against Iran. Let's get serious about #climatechange & #peace & get out of bed w Saudi who r oil barrons & sponsors of terrorism.
4094 2018-12-13 16:48:32 There is supposed to be garden herb and rosemary and olive oil on my Garden Herb and Rosemary and Olive Oil @TheRealTriscuit right?  #overyou #noflavor #iguessthatswhytheyre3for5

4096 2018-12-13 16:48:25 @GaraviniG I research the history of international oil, and I found some particularly interesting documents on the early formation of #OPEC at the BP Archive and in the diaries of Fuad Ruhani. I can't wait to read your history of OPEC! Should be a huge contribution
4097 2018-12-13 16:48:24 When I love her, everything she do without me is some HOE SHIT! Bitch how dare you go get a oil change in those damn shorts.
4098 2018-12-13 16:48:16 After hitting a pothole hard, u start looking for the leaking oil u don't wanna see
4099 2018-12-13 16:48:16 @ABDanielleSmith 
I think Brett Wilson was being polite that he says we want to stay as one country.  Alberta and Saskatchewan have so many opportunities that the federal government are restricting. Our oil needs to flow, the same as Potash and wheat.
4100 2018-12-13 16:48:13 Aplica la receta chaira: ponte Vitacilina. O lubricante para coches. Top Oil de Bardhal o algo así. Y aguántate. Perdiste.
4101 2018-12-13 16:48:08 right rail and transit are a major component of state economic engines. When your car has a problem you turn it off for a bit then once assessed or fixed you get up and running and keep going. 

Climate change is like not changing your oil or transmission fluid.
4102 2018-12-13 16:47:56 They get on my nerves when it’s time for oil changes
4103 2018-12-13 16:47:52 Making medicated coconut oil. Yummmm
4104 2018-12-13 16:47:46 A Cop and a puppet for big oil walk into a bar...
4105 2018-12-13 16:47:32 With respect, it really doesn’t. It pales in comparison to Inhofe’s criminal history of shilling for Big Oil. It registers even less against the self-enrichment of the Trump Crime Family. Oh, and there’s the small matter of a president gaining office through fraud - INDIVIDUAL 1.
4106 2018-12-13 16:47:23 I get that. I think Suez and Brexit potentially quite good comparisons. As for effect on man in street diff to compare - I expect it to be bad but slow burn bad over a long period rather than severe hit of, say, global crisis triggered by 2007/8 or 73/4 Arab oil crisis.

4110 2018-12-13 16:46:54 Lol get u some blac castor oil
4111 2018-12-13 16:46:50 Also ridiculous as a coal spill or Russian oil spill would be a big problem too.
4112 2018-12-13 16:46:35 It is an amazing place.
4113 2018-12-13 16:46:35 Excuse my ignorance BUT , why cant Alberta oil be shipped out of Churchhill Falls to New Brunswick ?????
4114 2018-12-13 16:46:30 What do think started World War II? Hint: hitler gassing the Jews; therefore the origin of the war was religion. Anything war in the Middle East is centered around religion/cultural ideologies/oil.  There are obvious outliers but men most often are sent to slaughter over religion
4115 2018-12-13 16:46:13 Or maybe a Bulgarian salad!, Feta cheese, cucumber, tomatoes and black olives - it doesn't really need oil.
4116 2018-12-13 16:46:13 Oh my gosh another snake oil doctor.
4117 2018-12-13 16:46:13 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
4118 2018-12-13 16:46:03 Beard oil for guys
4119 2018-12-13 16:46:03 Pass. A meticulous bowl of tonkotsu ramen with chashu and some black garlic chili oil is absolute heaven.
4120 2018-12-13 16:45:45 Yes that coconut oil need to be washed off especially in the hair tf?
4121 2018-12-13 16:45:34 So what you are saying is Heritage Foundation is ready to call upon this Trump administration to end subsidies on US Farms, Ethanol, Oil and Gas, and the Housing subsidies?

Or are you just being hypocritical?
4122 2018-12-13 16:45:34 I may be laid up, but there is a silver lining. My hub is home taking care of the girl and is making his awesome Italian sandwiches for lunch. They are always so sloppy with olive oil and have a healthy dose of red pepper spread.
4123 2018-12-13 16:45:26 A great hair thickener/voluminizer - add a drop of rosemary essential oil to your fav shampoo.  #EssentialOils #EthicalIsBeautifulBeBeautiful
4124 2018-12-13 16:45:18 What kind of oil you using on your skin dear , it's super clear tho
4125 2018-12-13 16:45:02 Anyone who is remotely saying this is true, seriously need to look at the money. Follow the money and it will tell you were it came from. Obama used there own assets to get a deal. Which made gas cheap and allowed us to pass the tankers for oil thru the peninsula. #realdeal
4126 2018-12-13 16:44:45 Rub anointing oil on ya head n try again 
4127 2018-12-13 16:44:38 Get half of an avocado, olive oil and honey. Put it in a blender until it looks like gel. Section off your hair and comb it through. Put on a shower cap for 30-40 minutes. Wash and condition.

Thank me later

4132 2018-12-13 16:44:16 OIL 1H that was fast, consolidaton & sell off to continue this new 1st wave up. WHALES want to stay above $50 a barrel & break all technicals to move it up. "swim with the whales". UWT for awhile now.
4133 2018-12-13 16:44:11 Kalo aku adalah dengan keramas dulu, bilas ampe bersih, pake hair mask pijet pijet, tutup pake shower cap

4140 2018-12-13 16:43:04 Factors that will accelerate PetroDollar demise are mostly non-US:
• Main Oil buyer - China insisting on non-$ buy
• EU states starts buying Oil in €
• SWIFT alternative become a reality 
• US inward contraction due to its issues - excessive Debt, Deficit & domestic issues.
4141 2018-12-13 16:43:03 Remember there's a solid relationship between F EPS and long dated oil (CL4) Spooz can not ignore an oil recovery.
4142 2018-12-13 16:43:02 "But *Ron* *Paul* told me...!"

Remember my comments on peak oil and how much... "activity" there seemed to be around anything pushed to the fringes?

I thought it was just conspiratorial perspectives having a gravitational attraction to each other.

At first.

4145 2018-12-13 16:42:33 “Dirty” bitumen is a coined political concept funded by US oil and Arabs to suppress Canadian oil; as is “tar sands”.    Bitumen is bitumen.  It requires extraction.  Crude also requires cleaning —sulfur included- before use.

4161 2018-12-13 16:40:41 I mean technical motor oil is flammable too.. ;)
4162 2018-12-13 16:40:34 Isn’t socially acceptable - yet they import foreign oil (from radical countries I add) at double the cost they could buy from AB for and support our own country/people/hospitals schools roads and the elderly......just saying. They’re not CDN!

4165 2018-12-13 16:40:16 That’s how the game is played. It’s a long standing strategy that the car makers throw up their hands and blame the oil industry, who throws up their hands and blames the car makers. Whatever keeps governments talking and not acting serves their business-as-usual bottom lines
4166 2018-12-13 16:40:07 I need an oil change 
4167 2018-12-13 16:40:05 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
4168 2018-12-13 16:40:00 I was getting an oil change and went to go sit down in the waiting area and the only chair open had a purse on it.. I asked the lady if I could sit down and she said NO 
4169 2018-12-13 16:39:59 I think it is a bet that will blow up. The East Side has the abundant in demand ground water. The West side is 100% dependent on irrigation. They have gone over 1000 ft to over 1500 ft and even hit brackish water. look where the oil and gas is at....
4170 2018-12-13 16:39:56 I would think it would work better as fuel than oil.
4171 2018-12-13 16:39:54 Yeah it’s sad you gotta move to Texas to make decent oil cash
4172 2018-12-13 16:39:45 I’d say protein, but that joke is way too easy.
4173 2018-12-13 16:39:33 The Lord is my keeper, he is always watching over my life
4174 2018-12-13 16:39:32 You funny. I have an anecdote for snake oil of you’re interested.
4175 2018-12-13 16:39:25 It’s a mix of gold oil paint, oil pastels, and gold leaf
4176 2018-12-13 16:39:22 Tough 1st if back to backs tonight for the Oil. Will have to bus 2.5 hrs after the game to Grand Forks, ND because Winnipeg doesn’t have an airport. @OilersNation
4177 2018-12-13 16:39:06 Including Hydro means including all other forms of electrical generation, which will further increase Alberta's relative Have status by including any oil/gas revenue twice as both product sold and electrical power. Try thinking your ideas through to their inevitable consequences
4178 2018-12-13 16:39:03 Google ‘oil industries covert campaign’.  Should see a NYT article that stunning to me.  Paul  *The artical will likely be reprinted several times in other papers if you’re past monthly allotment from NYT. Focus on RAISING mpg guides.

4180 2018-12-13 16:38:28 Remember this started as a $500 billion oil coup....that is rolling right along
4181 2018-12-13 16:38:23 They sell it at health food stores. Do you think the Pope would oppose? I hear it is good for anxiety and pain and there is no drugs in CBD oil. I would rather try that than take Ativan that the Dr wanted me to take.
4182 2018-12-13 16:38:20 Yeaah it’s really good at removing the oil
4183 2018-12-13 16:38:16 #Crude #Oil and #Ethanol ... nearing bottom -- fundamentals and demand remain steady to strong.  In my opinion, its time for #Crude #Oil  and #Ethanol to bottom, trade accordingly.
4184 2018-12-13 16:38:12 We have increased our oil and natural gas production so we can enter into the European energy market and get rid of their dependence on Russian energy,  multiple sanctions have been levied against Russia, we’ve armed the Ukrainians and the Georgians. I don’t see this as pro-Putin
4185 2018-12-13 16:38:10 mix it with a lil coconut oil or gingerly oil or other thinner oils so its not so thick and smooth
4186 2018-12-13 16:37:57 I need cuticle oil. Ion know why I didn’t buy any 
4187 2018-12-13 16:37:56 I've been watching oil, tried to play a long in refinery ($PSX) but got stopped out a few days ago...

I can't tell if this consolidation under the $54 dollar level in crude is gonna lead to a break down or up...should be interesting to see how it resolves
4188 2018-12-13 16:37:52 And too few carbs in his mouth
4189 2018-12-13 16:37:51 It's estimated that in 2023 an Oil Glut will be reached. This means that the major producers of oil will be making a million barrels per day of surplus oil, even the US is trying to get rid of their oil reserves, why are we not moving out of this oil depency.
4190 2018-12-13 16:37:48 You’d need bailing out again within 6 months. No oil, no fish, no industry, no real government,no Barnet formula, no money, no help.Left with the SNP & that Sturgeon woman. Ouch.
4191 2018-12-13 16:37:34 Hmm. It’s funny then how people who hold no political title have real political power. People such as the CEO’s of big banks, oil companies, hedge fund companies, telecommunication conglomerates—the list goes on.

Money & influence is political power. Not so much titles, sadly.

4193 2018-12-13 16:37:33 Absolutely. If they're arguing that it's a problem that Beto's wwc donors happen to work in the oil industry (it's Texas after all) then the same principle applies here.

Don't believe what you hear from TYT, they're funded by uber-wealthy corporate shareholders.
4194 2018-12-13 16:37:32 So out of touch he doesn't even know he is telling us how out of touch he is.
4195 2018-12-13 16:37:32 When Trudeau was younger, he came in Calgary to protest against our oil! He is always been against Western Provinces and to me this is a criminal act: Alberta has given billions of dollars to the East and Quebec.. and this is how they treat us! I want to separate from them!
4196 2018-12-13 16:37:28 Well, it's not as if this is anything new.

I just finished a bio of George Washington.
The Continental Army wintered every year about half-barefoot and without jackets, within a days ride of cities full of food and clothing.

4198 2018-12-13 16:37:13 When a client rings you up and gives you a contract  to look at 9 off shore oil rigs . Certainly a nice call , and off to London next week to start the scoping exercise . # busy Christmas

4201 2018-12-13 16:36:54 You can never compare #Petro with #Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency.
Cryptocurencies don't depend on any gouverment.
Dictador Maduro issued #Petro violating all the laws in Venezuela.
Price is determined by himself and it is not backed up by any oil as he says.

4205 2018-12-13 16:36:08 I think most Albertans understand who Rachel is at this point.  Like Trudeau, she in the past has made a case to shut down the oil business.

4209 2018-12-13 16:35:34 Just arrived today - RIVE GAUCHE by SENNELIER, fine oil colours for artists. Fast drying and less yellowing with good lightfastness  and thick texture. Made with Safflower oil. Available in 200ml tubes.

4211 2018-12-13 16:35:26 Yikes. Must have to do with lower oil production.
4212 2018-12-13 16:35:23 There is more evidence vaccines cause autism then there is in man made global warming. Both distort reality in the way they are argued. Vaccines substantially improve the quality of life for millions at the risk of the very few and oil based energy improves our lives drastically
4213 2018-12-13 16:35:15 Anyways in a bit I'm going to head out shortly to pick up some more of my glass bottle oil milk and some booze on the way back home.
4214 2018-12-13 16:35:15 lmao truuuu ok ill get an oil change today on my car and ill be ready to go anywhere
4215 2018-12-13 16:35:07 Put it all in a large bowl and slowly mix. Takes about 5 minutes but it's a good workout for the arm. Once mixed thoroughly, put back in jar and store in fridge. It remains spreadable and oil won't separate.

4231 2018-12-13 16:33:39 The recent move in banks and the one in early ‘16 both seem over done. Last time’s was oil/rate related, this time appears to be more late cycle/credit concerns
4232 2018-12-13 16:33:36 Reminder in case you forgot: Michael Cohen’s + Mike Flynn’s role in Ukraine Peace Plan (aka sanctions) and that oil deal quid pro quo, Rosneft (wink wink). We know you know!

4241 2018-12-13 16:33:11 What is "Canadian Heritage"? To me we are a mix of all heritages. That's why we have the Highland games, Irish festival, etc. Promoting pipelines isn't a "heritage" thing, it's an oil and gas thing.   #nbpoli

4252 2018-12-13 16:32:09 That is what happens when oil prices drop. Should be a sign that oil production is getting shut.
4253 2018-12-13 16:32:01 Did not say they receive equalization. They received indirect subsidies like Trans mountain that was bought to develop Alberta’s oil industry. Plus direct subsidies with credit. All in all, Qc and Alberta receive same level of support but not the same way
4254 2018-12-13 16:31:53 well, she said she voted to send the bill to committee based on advice from oil industry reps, and that she could not vote to pass the bill into law in its current form, so i feel like she’s doing okay so far.

4257 2018-12-13 16:31:45 Every time I go get an oil change I promise you I leave spending over 200$ instead of 30$ because they always want to do something to my car  
4258 2018-12-13 16:31:44 Idealogy. Flynn is an islamaphobe. We lift sanctions and the good 'arabs' get what they want/need to keep oil going, keep Israel 'safe' and bad 'arabs' (Iran) in their place until they can be turned into good 'arabs . Oh, and everybody makes $$$.

4264 2018-12-13 16:31:23 Curious if they ever tried CBD oil; have read before that it helps tremendously with siezures.
4265 2018-12-13 16:31:17 I was a VP at a startup oil sands company. When I started we had zero production. When I resigned my position (family reasons) our team had grown the company to 35,000 barrels a day and it was a publically traded company. I am proud of what we achieved.
4266 2018-12-13 16:31:09 This is great. Investment in public transport us the surest way to reduce imports of oil and cut pollution. Please look into Bengaluru needs as the City is choking with traffic. A quick commencement of service to Airport is immensely feasible

4275 2018-12-13 16:30:26 A gentle uplift for $USDCAD overnight reaching 1.3384. No major data releases this morning, CAD being held to risk sentiment and the prices of crude oil.
4276 2018-12-13 16:30:21 Except your idea of "liberty" is oil n gas taking profits out of Colorado and leaving environmental wreck behind.
4277 2018-12-13 16:30:17 I think the main trigger for this will be when oil is no longer the main source of fuel or if S. Arabia suddenly decide that oil prices are far too cheap. There’ll be some trigger and the regime will fall by the hands of the US - either directly or though a proxy like Israel.
4278 2018-12-13 16:30:16 Nearly as good as F-19. Many hours were spent flying around destroying oil fields. Great times the early 90’s.

4282 2018-12-13 16:30:04 The Green New Deal will inevitably be watered down before it can be passed. It needs to start with radical demands so the final version is still tolerable.

Therefore it should begin by demanding that oil execs be launched into the sun, & compromise down to 100% renewable energy.

4293 2018-12-13 16:29:24 A lot of silent councillors on supporting the oil industry?  Can we get a list of those councillors?

4298 2018-12-13 16:29:02 Actually they are all coming true. I’m guessing you are a paid for bot, like most of the paid for bots that support @powerthefuture . Of course no expense is too great when you are backed by the oil billionaire Kochs

4306 2018-12-13 16:28:02 John Cornyn,  Saudi Arabia is sponsor terrorism. The U.S. is punishing Iran for the oil they can't get, and the leaders they can't control. The GOP would rather continue to assist in the killing, and starvation of the Yemeni people, rather than retreat for good cause.
4307 2018-12-13 16:27:43 Apparently Trudeau controls global oil prices and corresponding demand to price dynamics on low quality high cost forms of petroleum products

It is illegal and price is determined by himself.

in addition to showing the West Texas price of oil, why not also show the price per barrel that Alberta gets.  Most people do not know there is a difference.

4321 2018-12-13 16:25:30 No mailing after Dec 17 for Christmas. Remember I ship for free and that includes CBD oil
4322 2018-12-13 16:25:14 Safest is baloney. There are hundreds of oil spills as a result of those pipelines. And because of their inherent design, they leak far more product than any truck or train car. Quebec has not been offered adequate guarantees on mitigation or insurance from this line. #qcpoli
4323 2018-12-13 16:25:09 AsiFry nge castor oil sinye strong 
4324 2018-12-13 16:25:02 They take in nothing from Alberta “oil”
4325 2018-12-13 16:24:59 Is oil revenue received in Dollars or Naira? 

If it’s received in Dollars, in what currency will it be taxed? In Naira?

Better open your eyes.
4326 2018-12-13 16:24:58 FYI Baby oil takes it off
4327 2018-12-13 16:24:48 Aye lemme trade that full detail I was suppose to get for a oil change
4328 2018-12-13 16:24:44 Snake oil is the new blood and soil.
4329 2018-12-13 16:24:35 Oil. That’s the secret. Lots of oil.  oh. And make the pan really hot before you add the egg.
4330 2018-12-13 16:24:33 Soo true. I think each service advisor sets their own prices on things too. They definitely are trying to make money on things that customers aren’t planning on having to get done when they are just planning on having an oil change.
4331 2018-12-13 16:24:31 Heard that KSA is also selling it's  oil in other currencies than dollar.Qatar has also move out of OPEC for the same reason
4332 2018-12-13 16:24:31 Can I choose to dump my used oil in your yard?  I like to have choice and all...
4333 2018-12-13 16:24:30 Import Prices dropped 1.6% in November, which was led by the cost of oil.
4334 2018-12-13 16:24:25 Downside market leadership is worrisome. YTD:
Oil Services down 37.55%
Gold/Silver down 19.54%
Bank Stocks down 16%
Transports down 8.69%
Midcaps down 6.89%
Russell 2000 down 5.77%
Semis down 4.26%
Not the stuff or raging bull markets
4335 2018-12-13 16:24:23 The only entity that pays climate scientists well are governments. They pay them real well with benefits if they keep scaring people into considering paying higher taxes on energy. So tell me what other entity has a need for climatologists? It sure isn't the oil companies.

4338 2018-12-13 16:23:56 That is the only thing on their history they done,to destroy other people's lives and history and religion! They never succeeded on nothing, I really can't imagine what those primitive creatures was realized without oil!But everything has on end,the oil also !!! Be careful Islam
4339 2018-12-13 16:23:55 I really don’t know how you could have sympathy for any oil executives
4340 2018-12-13 16:23:50 Efficascent oil please. 
4341 2018-12-13 16:23:49 Solid night with chili oil g na g!
4342 2018-12-13 16:23:44 How does this benefit HMPQ other than helping pump the the stock price? 23% of your crop failed, you are not producing oil, and you have not even completed building the extraction plant. Zero product, zero revenue= pump and dump.
4343 2018-12-13 16:23:42 Pake oil cleanser aja janga mw.

4344 2018-12-13 16:23:34 Every time I go to Jiffy Lube to get my oil changed they always pull out my filters. Put them bitches back, I’ll figure out how to change them myself like I always do.
4345 2018-12-13 16:23:29 You are a funny guy, Geno. Everything you said is absolutely wrong except the fact about coal and renewable energy. I am all for renewable energy! So is Big Oil.  In fact they are investing billions of dollars in renewable energy.
4346 2018-12-13 16:23:27 @charlottesweb is supposed to be some of the best. I bought some of the oil for severe anxiety but haven't tried it yet because I'm trying to manage it with meditation techniques. 

They're the ones that did the study to help children with incurable seizures.
4347 2018-12-13 16:23:15 Do y’all know how much it costs to get oil for a house? It’s expensive. Thank your parents for keeping you warm because I’m about to keep this thermostat at 65 
4348 2018-12-13 16:23:13 The KRISS Vector Jason bought has no recoil bc it fires the bullet from a unique angle making the interior look like an oil derrick therefore I named it Derrick so dm me next time you need a name for an inanimate object/baby

4354 2018-12-13 16:22:50 So I’m getting an oil change rn & the guy at the front desk is on the phone w someone and he just read out all of his card information super loud
4355 2018-12-13 16:22:46 He also seems to be an infant.
4356 2018-12-13 16:22:34 That IMHO is a bit of hyperbole. The same market forces that will drive a change from oil to some other form of efficient energy, will engage way before our home is uninhabitable. It's already happening.  Just a the market's pace. Anything else s/b viewed with healthy skepticism.

4359 2018-12-13 16:22:26 Abscess adjacent- I get oil cysts. It's basically where your natural skin oil ducts close and turn into painful lumps under the skin. It's sorta like zits without the infection, and they are miserable.

4363 2018-12-13 16:21:36 Imagine this.
'UK parliament in Edinburgh, oil reserves in the Solent,in English waters. Scotland votes Tory and imposes Tory governments on England (who vote ENP or Labour consistently) ,Scotland rips off England for 3 centuries, think the English would put up with that ? No way

4377 2018-12-13 16:20:46 This is eye-opening.  I'm in the wrong industry I now must assume!  Damn fossil fuels.
4378 2018-12-13 16:20:35 That's how they went to sell this one shea butter whip cream infused with coconut oil and called it banana oil for her and she bought it for alot of euros. One tiny bottle I should come and sell stuff here. I'll make mad money.

4386 2018-12-13 16:19:49 National Climate Assessment: Reducing methane will protect not only climate, but also human health by lowering ozone levels. We need the new rules on oil & gas from @PennsylvaniaDEP to prioritize methane reductions! #NewYearNewRules

4401 2018-12-13 16:18:40 What? When? You can’t quote something that wasn’t said. Well, Trump and Fox News can but others tend not to quote what was actually said which was “Mexico is paying for the wall.” Period! Only now is he coming up with this latest snake oil pitch.
4402 2018-12-13 16:18:35 yo someone hook me up with that beard growing oil.... I'm sprouting
4403 2018-12-13 16:18:32 Be his beard oil.
4404 2018-12-13 16:18:31 A little more perspective;

 “oil and gas accounted for $114 billion of Canada's GDP last year, compared to $18 billion from the auto sector.”

4407 2018-12-13 16:18:20 I got this fancy peanut butter cause it was on sale and now I know why  that shit has more oil than my skin 
4408 2018-12-13 16:18:14 You finally have a govt (provincially/federally) trying to get oil to tidewater in a way that is legal/constitutional (aka For the VERY FIRST TIME doing it in a way that would give it a chance of actually happening).

That's something more than you've EVER had

4412 2018-12-13 16:17:47 Take some boneless chicken breast, cut up some potatoes, mix the potatoes in a some olive oil, ranch dressing mix, and lemon pepper seasoning put chicken and potatoes in a pan and on top of that add some broccoli if you want, cover pan with tin foil and cook for 2hrs and 30 min.
4413 2018-12-13 16:17:44 That’s because your hair is dry; same as mine. It’s best to apply something that makes it soft like the sheabutter and coconut oil in warm water mixture first. Even your hands will easily comb through it. Either that or any moisturiser/ conditioner will do the trick
4414 2018-12-13 16:17:22 The worst thing for the day that just happened to me :  i really dk where i put my makeup remover and i had to use oil and soap to remove my makeup. :(
4415 2018-12-13 16:17:10 I’ve been using Neutrogena oil free acne wash daily scrub for years
4416 2018-12-13 16:17:07 Sorry bud, it would have to be left open so the rUK could purchase our oil, gas, water and electricity. Unlike the tories, we're not so cold hearted that we'd see our neighbours suffering unnecessarily...
4417 2018-12-13 16:17:03 Calling opponents of a pipeline “eco-terrorists” is like calling advocates for the oil and gas industry “petro-terrorists.” Shows your complete contempt for democracy and the rule of law.

4422 2018-12-13 16:16:25 There is no insecurity here in Rivers State.  People only de-market  the state for political reasons.  

There is  no insecurity when it comes to drilling oil for the economic wellbeing  of the entire country.  But they claim insecurity when it comes to political  gains.
4423 2018-12-13 16:16:25 It was an ok small move. But let's get something big here. Same old Mets. With a snake oil salesman at the helm.
4424 2018-12-13 16:16:17 I’m getting my oil change at Mini and the dealers are talking about 4lokos and how kids drink them and they should be banned lol
4425 2018-12-13 16:16:17 Why is it when you take your car in for an oil change...somehow you end up paying over $500 for a bunch of other repairs that you have no know idea what they are?
4426 2018-12-13 16:16:14 If you think it is all so innocent, why don’t you tell us all about Trump Tower Moscow, the sanctions, and how much you stood to gain from the Rosneft Oil Fields?
4427 2018-12-13 16:16:06 If I were oil king, I would buy Yume-Cas :(
4428 2018-12-13 16:16:02 On my skin! Not sure how it would work under makeup but after washing + toning my face I applied hyaluronic acid then like three drops of grapeseed oil on top and my skin feels really good. Not tight, dry, or greasy at all!

4432 2018-12-13 16:15:21 So ... are you giving our oil back then ???
4433 2018-12-13 16:15:04 When you had the longest day and were looking forward to a quiet airport ride but no the driver wants to talk about oil prices, trade with china, brexit and every single problem in the universe laaaa
4434 2018-12-13 16:15:04 It should be about as thick as motor oil so it can stick to the ball and the paper. Then he caps it.
4435 2018-12-13 16:15:01 So, in those Dawn dish soap commercials where they are cleaning oil off the duck...did they put that duck in oil just to clean it off, or do they bring their marketing crew to oil spills to make their commercials?
4436 2018-12-13 16:14:54 I’m not Zac but peppermint essential oil on the temples and across the forehead seems to take the edge off. And lots of water. I hope you’re feeling better soon!

Hey, how’s your new bionic knee?!?! Ready to kick some a$$ and take names?!
4437 2018-12-13 16:14:54 seem fry too longred meat is easy cooked,should more care the oil temp and singe
4438 2018-12-13 16:14:52 @TheCurrentCBC in electric cars all the plastic that contains the metals and acidic fluid in the batteries comes from oil. All the wires are shrouded in plastic made from oil.
4439 2018-12-13 16:14:45 Need a natural way to condition, style, and finish your hair? There is a lustrous hair oil formulated with every hair type in mind. To learn more ask me about it.
4440 2018-12-13 16:14:43 This is spot on. If PSG wasn't being financially backed by oil there is no way the likes of Mbappe or Neymar would even consider them. 

They are a minted version of Celtic.  Romp home domestically but flunk in Europe.

4443 2018-12-13 16:14:39 A balanced approach is smart as is self sufficiency when energy dependent. Look at what the US has done in a short while and also reduced emissions.

Norway ramping up production to meet global supply meanwhile anti oil Liberals lock in - stupid

4448 2018-12-13 16:14:06 When you follow the $ you see the US interference with Canadian economy, especially in oil & gas.  
Canadian Oil is being landlocked so US OIL can be exported, while Canadian oil is sold at huge discount into US. 
Wake up people.  Trudeau govt is enabling this.
4449 2018-12-13 16:14:04 I’m most definitely getting my oil change today
4450 2018-12-13 16:14:02 Finally getting my oil changed! My mom over exaggerates about everything “you better get that oil change for your ass be on the side of the road”
4451 2018-12-13 16:13:44 The declining importance of the NatSec and economic implications of importing oil has been crucial in pushing conservative law-makers away from energy efficiency and renewables. They never liked it, and now that the US is "energy dominant" they don't have to care about it anymore
4452 2018-12-13 16:13:41 So is the Robert F. Kennedy award because of his kill list, all the countries he bombed, expansion  of the surveillance state, ignoring North Dakota protestors being brutalized by oil police, or rewarding the criminals who crashed our economy? #ThursdayThoughts

4456 2018-12-13 16:13:16 Why do you think we’re in this mess because the sheep listen to guys like this and believe. Wake up AB you have been manipulated by big oil forever. You keep forgetting they broke you in 3 months with conservative help and are leaving their mess behind.

4460 2018-12-13 16:12:58 Do something useful and cut off the equalization payments if you want to buy votes for next years election. Then we can actually save the money we are loosing on our oil
4461 2018-12-13 16:12:55 I don’t know about using it for pain but I just started using CBD oil for anxiety, and that stuff works better than my meds. I hope you get relief soon. The cold weather definitely doesn’t help.
4462 2018-12-13 16:12:42 We’ve all had shit jobs but he clearly has way too much time on his hands.
4463 2018-12-13 16:12:41 Fixing #climatechange is not a compromise, it’s a very big opportunity, every economy will benefit from every action taken, renewable energy is clean, cheap, easy and profitable, electric cars displace oil imports, there are short, medium and long term benefits, everyone wins !!!
4464 2018-12-13 16:12:41 So I decide to go check on the oil change.

Car wasn't even pulled in yet.

Appt was at 915am. It was still sitting outside.

Doing my utmost to not take it out on the customer service rep but also need them to understand my extreme "displeasure".

Not happy @OntarioHyundai_
4465 2018-12-13 16:12:35 Me: I want to do an oil change and rotate my tires before I leave. 
Mom: Oh okay good. That can be your Christmas present 
Me: NOOO
4466 2018-12-13 16:12:25 Jeeez...you're not kidding!

4468 2018-12-13 16:12:14 Who can not control  leaders of his party, how gonna manage unruly bunch of unruly regional party leaders. The media houses and journalists burning mid night oil to promote @RahulGandhi , neither serving nation, nor doing justice to profession.
4469 2018-12-13 16:12:07 Unicorn farts go further. Everyone wants us off of oil but as far as I can tell there isn’t an alternative to sustain 7 billion ppl so I’ll stick with what is available and inexpensive.
4470 2018-12-13 16:11:50 Makes sense. If car companies and oil interests diverge, oil loses one of their biggest historical allies.
4471 2018-12-13 16:11:25 Three years late. Trudeau and co are intentionally killing the oil industry with a death by a thousand cuts

4475 2018-12-13 16:11:14 In recent years NL offshore oil was refined in the province, just not at daily production rates as the refinery in Come by Chance was not designed to process that crude diet.
4476 2018-12-13 16:11:12 Good riddance, it was an insane project proposed by the worst oil and gas company in Canada. Go ask Michigan what they think of Enbridge.

4481 2018-12-13 16:10:39 What are you defending your region from exactly?   Anti pipeline is not anti oil.  Quebec oil consumption remains regardless.  So rather you vote to support Iran, and support more dangerous and environmentally risky means of acquiring crude.  Congrats

4486 2018-12-13 16:10:18 Also, the Hummer doesn't happen without a collapse in oil prices in the 80s/90s. It was the tailend of a cyclical shift towards large SUVs.
4487 2018-12-13 16:10:17 Don’t retouch it. Rather straighten your natural hair. Alternatively, just be mix Sheabutter and coconut oil in warm water and spray on your hair. That one too works

4489 2018-12-13 16:10:08 Your statement was true during Obama reghin!
Now that Trump is @potus we are now bringing money in from all over the . We are exporting oil again! First in 75 years! Why do you think the price of gas is ?We are exporting and selling more LNG gas than any other country in !

Unlike in many other countries that are managing their oil resources well, We still can't get Oil Licensing right.

4495 2018-12-13 16:09:54 Oil has always been big in terms of economies. Canada sells way more oil to the U.S. than Saudi & at a very low cost. Canada has huge amounts of oil including tar sands because it was home to large prehistoric life which is the source of oil. Canada should be given respect in oil
4496 2018-12-13 16:09:30 I guna Biore Cleansing oil it does the job, clean better than normal make up remover. Overall takda problem puas hati sangat.

4498 2018-12-13 16:09:24 Big time. I used to go to them until I knew better. Now it's NTB, this 10 min oil change spot by my crib or my Mexicans over east lol
4499 2018-12-13 16:09:17 Eventually if inventories keep on drawing every week we will suddenly get everyone to be chasing oil at the same time...But this is probably only for late Q1.
4500 2018-12-13 16:08:44 @CNET, can y'all post some new stuff and stop recycling your stuff. If I see Wal-Mart's patient, Disney's high flying robots, or fried food with no oil again I'm going to stop following you.

4506 2018-12-13 16:07:58 I agree...One is much better off just buying the oil futures outright.

4510 2018-12-13 16:07:33 Nice spin. Got any snake oil?
4511 2018-12-13 16:07:24 You use the yellow bit to Wash oil off plastic ?
4512 2018-12-13 16:07:19 But it was strange as there has been various bullish news for oil this week 1) Opec deal 2) Outage in Libya 3) Canada deal to cut 325k bpd of output 4) Strongest demand ever from China 5) US inventories lower for two weeks in a row... And so on.
4513 2018-12-13 16:07:17 Yeah, I just was reading a thread about how the whole corruption situation in Brazil comes down to oil.  And the level to which Saudi and Russian governments are becoming aggressive?

4517 2018-12-13 16:06:39 The cannabis thing. Big concern here is that now unregulated tobacco companies and monsanto are monopolising it. And they cannot be trusted with health concerns. It should never be legalized. Only decriminalized. Cbd oil should also be treated completely separately. Not the same!

4522 2018-12-13 16:06:26 So Scotland is not reliant on Oil & Gas revenues?
Just Westminster?
Can’t wait for Independence to have the chance to make the decision to leave it in the ground.
4523 2018-12-13 16:06:08 Importing Saudi Oil and not meeting domestic supply internally is doing something? Preventing export of LNG to displace Chinese coal is doing something?
4524 2018-12-13 16:06:06 Support for pipelines/getting oil to market is tied to developing renewables (AB is well placed), lowering emissions, reducing energy use. It’s amazing that so many in AB don’t get that. Probably b/c of climate change denial. I don’t care if you believe; it’s just good business.

4527 2018-12-13 16:05:56 Just in case you need history lesson between Saudi Arabia and US. It is all about the oil. We are so dependent on them. And now also on Russia for oil. Why do you think Obama was pushing hard for electric cars and alternative fuel? So that we are not dependent on these countries.
4528 2018-12-13 16:05:50 It will be reckless for African countries to believe that the high prices of commodities like crude oil, and metals of the last decade will return any time soon, if ever.

4531 2018-12-13 16:05:44 Maybe they meant a different kind of oil 
4532 2018-12-13 16:05:36 Obama didn't give them anything. He released the funds that had been seized. It was their money. I know you think you can just go in and take (Oil from Iraq anyone), but if you want to play at being president, you really need to learn truth from fiction.
4533 2018-12-13 16:05:14 Sorry, us millennials don't care if the oil is local. I'm waiting for Toyota to shift to hydrogen fuel cells, so I can retrofit my vehicle. Keep as much of it as we can in the ground.
4534 2018-12-13 16:05:12 You do know about the magic, full length oil painting of myself that sits in my attic, right?

4571 2018-12-13 16:02:30 Scotland's problem is that this isn't true. First, Faslane and (perhaps even more crucially) Glen Douglas. Second, Scotland is sitting on an eye-watering amount of oil, the revenues from which are vital to shoring up post-Brexit England.
4572 2018-12-13 16:02:20 ... while expanding oil sands, buying pipelines and fracking gas for a massive LNG project. yeah, we're leaders.
4573 2018-12-13 16:02:19 Really angry right now. Two Canadians being held in China because we hold a major lady thanks from the USA. It always goes back to Iran and all they want is the oil. We are going to pay for this thanks to Washington. Hello Ottawa, you have failed us yet again.

4575 2018-12-13 16:02:01 So was $XPO secretly hoarding bitcoin, or did they borrow heavily to acquire offshore oil rigs? Not a lot of other ways to lose this much market cap this quickly in the last few months.
4576 2018-12-13 16:01:56 Engine oil leaks can be caused by a variety of things, but since oil leaks can be so destructive, the cost of repairing the leak is almost always worth it to make sure your car stays running and doesn't leave you stranded or worse. If you suspect a leak, call us!

4578 2018-12-13 16:01:52 You have to consider the population demographics. Beto won in the “cities”, but Texas is still largely agricultural and oil driven. Not to mention, despite gains, Texas is essentially still a non-voting state. The only solid voting block is white and “conservative”
4579 2018-12-13 16:01:51 Using the word "exploit" and "manipulator" negates every single thing you're trying to BS us with. You're a snake oil salesman, a cad, a charlatan sir. take your tat and your phoney wares over the horizon and be gone.

4584 2018-12-13 16:01:34 At CBD BioCare, our oil contains virtually no THC. Once the oil is first extracted, the THC is further isolated and removed. Most often our oil testing shows no detectable amounts of THC in our tinctures. #cbd #cbdoil #cbdproducts #hemp #hempoil
4585 2018-12-13 16:01:21 OPEC'S WORST NIGHTMARE – The US field production of crude oil reached 11.5 million barrels a day in September 2018, an all-time monthly record (based upon records maintained since January 1920) and a +21% increase in production in just the last 12 months (Department of Energy).

4593 2018-12-13 16:00:57 add oil!
4594 2018-12-13 16:00:46 True, until Trudeau, Butts, and Greenpeace turn their sights on their oil industry.

4599 2018-12-13 16:00:28 Most oil, gas and coal companies operate under very strict regulation and many have initiated new reclamation methods and mitigation. You don't have an alternative energy source w equivalent qualities, do you? Why do you denigrate what powers society?
4600 2018-12-13 16:00:25  yeah sorry  The uk is on of the responsibles for the immigrant problem in Europe, and the destruction on 3 countries. Because as you claim bad leaders I think oil is a better reason
4601 2018-12-13 16:00:22 The pipeline is an expansion, yes you do. The expansion will give you an extra tanker a day. This will not solve global low oil prices. Diversify, get into new energy and stop fighting against a finite resource that will rub dry one day

4609 2018-12-13 15:59:47 Figures big oil corporations are trying to maintain their revenues (as expected) and strangleholds on the population. 

How is the hydrogen for fuel cells produced in the first place?

4611 2018-12-13 15:59:39 Is Bernie going to get jobs for the 300,000 Texans who work in the oil industry and related fields, in the maple syrup industry? My husband who works for an oil company and donated to Beto would like to know.

4613 2018-12-13 15:59:24 What is the % ? The big environmental concerns are around bitumen, so if bitumen isn’t the majority then the environmental argument can be lessened. 
As a Canadian who wants oil moved via pipeline I want to know WTF is the deal with excess capacity caused by unused “reservations”
4614 2018-12-13 15:59:17 Thanks for responding. A message from the company would be nice. I called them when this all started and the woman I spoke to said it was an olive oil supply issue and they had not shut down, but now that their website is down I'm fearing the worst.

4622 2018-12-13 15:58:01 Coal was used to produce 30% of the US electricity last year. Natural gas 34%, and oil obviously runs our navy/Airforce. 

How are these resources not a vital national security interest?
4623 2018-12-13 15:57:57 Have finally had someone out... now awaiting a recovery truck In next hour . Shame this couldn’t automatically been organised on first call as with such an oil leak of course vehicle has to be towed.

4636 2018-12-13 15:56:13 I poured new oil into the fryer at work, but I forgot to shut the drain valve.
Gallon of oil all over the floor.

4641 2018-12-13 15:55:36 @RepSires Sir, hope to see solid support for HR 1091 today. Ending #genocide is surely a bipartisan issue, a necessary signal to send Burma, China & the world. If this bill to protect #Rohingya can't be passed, are we left with hemp oil as the only  unifying issue? @politico @AP
4642 2018-12-13 15:55:29 Now on to THC products please. The THC oil allows me to sleep without having to take as much benzodiazepines 
4643 2018-12-13 15:55:20 Chinese have already tapped in on Trumps calls... We have old Congress and Senate members that don’t even understand how search engines work. Yes, Trump supporters, this is not making America great! Coal and oil are more important than technology. Keeping old White folk wealthy
4644 2018-12-13 15:55:12 Market is definitely wrong on my oil positions...
4645 2018-12-13 15:55:12 Working at a Gas station next to a Car Wash that does oil changes as well have its perks 90$ car wash and oil for 40$ can’t beat that !!! #QT

4649 2018-12-13 15:54:36 That's funny, I don't see any oil rigs or gas wells in this photo. They must not be in NM.
4650 2018-12-13 15:54:33 Are you an oil exec?
4651 2018-12-13 15:54:24 We didn’t invent fuel & we haven’t stopped using sun and wind we have only just started. During the Second World War our troops in North Africa thought the Germans were poisoning the water with oil and the Germans thought we were doing it to them. That’s how much we knew in 1941

4653 2018-12-13 15:54:21 Most of the $ coming from foreign lobbyist groups who best profit from Alberta Oil not making it to tide water!

4658 2018-12-13 15:54:03 And Trudeau does not import oil like many claim. This is nothing new and not something the current gov’t started or decided.

4661 2018-12-13 15:53:27 Outlandish calls for next year? Brexit doesn’t happen ... Trump fires Powell ... ECB resumes QE ... U.S.-China trade dispute resolved and markets soar ... oil crashes to $20?

4662 2018-12-13 15:53:19 Fund member speaking - could you make clear what the policy of the NEST Ethical Fund is on fossil fuels (including oil and gas)? I've heard it has no investments but can't find a policy statement to back this up.
4663 2018-12-13 15:53:15 That oil pin had meeee friedddd bro. Go get y’all one.
4664 2018-12-13 15:53:15 I’m supposed to be going to get my mama oil changed but I don’t feel like moving at all

4666 2018-12-13 15:53:06 Can't be relied on upon demand. Dispatchable/base load sources, whatever you want to label them, can be controlled or turned off/on when you need them. Think a large dam, or a gas/coal/oil plant. We don't have that advantage with wind - albeit we're getting there with storage!
4667 2018-12-13 15:53:03 Today we comment about water  tomorrow about oil

So you’d recommend getting one?

4672 2018-12-13 15:52:45 Every time I try to change my oil the weather say nah 
4673 2018-12-13 15:52:45 Even if oil was to go to $150 tomorrow, Alberta would not get to share in it because we have no pipeline capacity to bring our product to market. Our most vital resource is landlocked. So frustrating. So stupid.

4679 2018-12-13 15:51:59 The medical uses of CBD are many, compared to any other oil.

Here’s what it can be used for effectively:

Pain management
Curbing inflammation
Managing blood sugar levels
Anxiety and other psychological disorders
Treating negative symptoms of cancer
To stop nausea
4680 2018-12-13 15:51:48 So your oil will still cost the same?  you want to leave Canada cause you can’t get your oil to world market, and by seperating, you will only sell to America... Hmm. Not to mention the tariffs y’all would face for imported products from Canada. Would it really be cheaper?

4689 2018-12-13 15:50:48 Burning the oil kills the planet, however while manufacturing of green alternatives and electric vehicle components, uses our oil the planet should be able to resist our damage as long as we stop killing forests as well.
4690 2018-12-13 15:50:47 It baffles me that a lot of people don’t use onions when they cook. That’s the initial flavor! You get them sautéing in oil/butter and it releases its extra flavor. People are truly missing out.
4691 2018-12-13 15:50:47 A little Natural drops of CBD oil will do the trick it's helped me in some tuff situations or times in my life. It's beats being prescribed some drug that could be addicting.

4696 2018-12-13 15:50:15 I think the air fryer’s best use is cooking for one or two…and using more oil than the recipe calls for : )

4698 2018-12-13 15:50:05 They are not all the same. We need better conduct from the oil companies, including huge ramp-ups in low carbon investment. We will not get that by painting them all with the same brush.
4699 2018-12-13 15:49:59 @TheCurrentCBC complete ban on oil products, a large scale up of renewable energy the government is going to pay for?’ Where does the government get the money from then? What industry? Agriculture? They need fuel. Manufacturing? Your plastic phone is made of oil. Tell us where?

4702 2018-12-13 15:49:44 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. They have a mandate to support the oil companies and are actively working to introduce US style Conservatism to Canada. This is propaganda, not news.

4720 2018-12-13 15:48:01 Norway is wonderful but a) it’s not socialist b) nationalized oil helps their social programs c) they *still* have issues with racism. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

4726 2018-12-13 15:47:06 @limited_united What is the ROIL brand history? Is it in any way linked to Rusape Oil Industies Limited?

shade some light.....
4727 2018-12-13 15:47:02 It only seems that she and her party have come around, as we near the election. If by some miracle she and her anti oil party were elected, we would be back to where we started 3 1/2 years ago.
4728 2018-12-13 15:47:02 She was an early birther. But has smiled in the Obamas’ faces. She’s a  and her husband’s the con man selling the  oil.
4729 2018-12-13 15:47:02 I gotta get some shopping done today with my non-existent money and also get my oil changed and alignment looked at...again w my negative bank balance. Let’s just hope today doesn’t end in public crying
4730 2018-12-13 15:46:56 Ya, you should be trying to use NL oil. I’m not sure why all Canadians would not prefer to support Canada instead of brutal dictatorships.
4731 2018-12-13 15:46:55 (6/...) it should also be pointed out that the data supplied by government shows our contribution to climate change is minimal in relation to others such as China. Should we still do more, yes. But not at the expense of jobs in oil sectors, auto industry, and subsidiaries markets
4732 2018-12-13 15:46:53 These are not oil paintings, they're prints
4733 2018-12-13 15:46:51 This needs to be retweeted countless times.. the only reason why they are after @elonmusk is because hes got his head on right. The only reason why the oil companies claim they are right is because they are greedy and have so much control with in the government..
4734 2018-12-13 15:46:50 Will my hair grow faster if I put coconut oil in it every week or is this just a myth beauty gurus who’ve had long hair all their lives like to talk about
4735 2018-12-13 15:46:44 At this point the planned late start of 11am for today's stream is not going to happen.

Oil change still not done and I have errands I need to run afterward.

I'm hoping I can sneak in a short afternoon stream once I'm back.
4736 2018-12-13 15:46:40 Government's don't import or export oil. Oil companies do. You know, the private sector.
4737 2018-12-13 15:46:39 Definitely. I did get a peppermint oil in there before which was really good for waking me up.
4738 2018-12-13 15:46:39 Babie oil.
4739 2018-12-13 15:46:39 It was a Big Oil/Deep State conspiracy, so no trial needed.
4740 2018-12-13 15:46:38 in the course of the #NATO military games #Norway’s KNM Helge Ingstad #collided with an oil #tanker and sank. A total of eight sailors suffered severe injuries, while the crew of 138 men was forced to abandon the frigate in a bid to save their lives. /

4742 2018-12-13 15:46:15 Me neither , n I know that.. Buh am getting myself a baby oil, n be far from trouble babe gal
4743 2018-12-13 15:46:15 Steam humidifier with eucalyptus oil, zinc lozenges for your throat, echinacea, vitamin c, and garlic extract to help boost your immune system, and if you can, a subcutaneous or intramuscular shot of 1000 iu of vitamin B12. Rest, fluids, and hope it's viral and not bacterial.
4744 2018-12-13 15:46:06 Stop day drinking... How long is the process for getting permits going through the EIS protocol for oil and gas.. 
We fell to 4500 barrels a day in 09 to 9500 in 16 110% rise with the permits already in place for the next year it took us to 10500
4745 2018-12-13 15:45:47 I don’t likening anymore since he left Arthur in this oil factory thing
4746 2018-12-13 15:45:45 When oil changes take almost 2 hours because my car is a pain in the ass.

4749 2018-12-13 15:45:37 My message to whistler. Stop using oil and gas. That’s the best solution
4750 2018-12-13 15:45:35 I like spinach and strawberries in a salad with slivered almonds, balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  Very tasty.

4754 2018-12-13 15:45:16 palm oil has the highest yield per crop. any other oil at that large of a supply would be 10x worse for the environment. not to mention palm oil doesnt even make 1/3 of the impact animal agriculture has. i don’t need to google shit. educate yourself before coming into my mentions
4755 2018-12-13 15:45:12 デートを楽しみました
4756 2018-12-13 15:45:08 Military on my mind but is fighting for oil worth it?

4759 2018-12-13 15:44:58 I’m not a peoples person AT OIL

4761 2018-12-13 15:44:43 Do you support more oil being refined and upgraded in Alberta? YES BUT NEVER WITH TAX DOLLARS!
4762 2018-12-13 15:44:33 Coil and oil relate to national security. Wind and solar do not. It would be nice to throw 20bil at new energy markets but we are 20trill in the hole. Feels bad man.
4763 2018-12-13 15:44:30 And the cost of living will rise out of control for the average American. Last time the democrats did this, a lot of people I know had to put the gas and oil they use to heat their homes on a credit card. No thanks.
4764 2018-12-13 15:44:30 Thanks. Super timing. When oil moves it gives good runs
4765 2018-12-13 15:44:24 Agreed, it's a horrific situation to be in, but it was also his CHOSEN profession and his job was to protect those kids.

4767 2018-12-13 15:44:18 Or devious and knowing that our water supply will be scarcer and scarcer as climate change will make water as pricey as oil
4768 2018-12-13 15:44:09 For all the men concerned: I’m getting my oil changed.
4769 2018-12-13 15:43:42 Oil will never go away, ever. Do you have any idea what all comes from oil?
4770 2018-12-13 15:43:35 A oil change just turned into needing brakes, a new tire, and just go ahead and get the inspection done too while u at it
4771 2018-12-13 15:43:33 Hi, we’re sorry to hear this. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.
4772 2018-12-13 15:43:28 and that doesn‘t even include the fuel savings by using electricity instead of gas :), for me it would be more than 1000 € every year + you don‘t have to pay for any maintenance like oil change etc :)
4773 2018-12-13 15:43:26 Not expensive (coconut oil)?
4774 2018-12-13 15:43:26 Sorry - Alberta needs to diversify their economy. You all can’t drive big trucks and have 3000 sq feet homes anymore. The end of the oil days are coming and Alberta needs to adapt. I applaud your efforts but they are futile
4775 2018-12-13 15:43:19 IMO, the Liberals bought the pipeline to put the expansion on the shelf permanently. No progress, no additional oil flowing, not today and probably never. The Liberal mandate is to phase out Alberta oil. Thomas, what part of that don't you understand, or are you now one of THEM?
4776 2018-12-13 15:43:13 まだ11月気分、秋真っ最中。

4777 2018-12-13 15:43:12 Guys with the plumber butt jobs are getting the last laugh IMO, and I’m damned happy for them.
4778 2018-12-13 15:43:12 There are no real barriers to trade at the border. It's only oil vans that are checked. The Brexiteers want everything checked.
4779 2018-12-13 15:43:07 Yo I hate to be that guy but this oil money is toooooo good
4780 2018-12-13 15:43:01 EOY? No. In the next year? Why not? It's happened before with oil. It just wasn't as liquid (pun) as XRP.
4781 2018-12-13 15:43:01 No. Put Jamaican black castor oil on them every night and make a wish. Lol that’s what my sister did.
4782 2018-12-13 15:42:48 He knows he’s fucked now and is just doing whatever his Nazi, Oil Barron friends ask him to do. Seriously his actions are leading to death and the destruction of our planet. He needs the guillotine.
4783 2018-12-13 15:42:42 If you put patchouli essential oil in your oatmeal lotion you can cure plaque, soriasis, and excema. You dont have to use terribly western medicine with horrendous side effects.

Ladies are you an honorable vessel? 
Join us for an exciting and fun evening of … …
4787 2018-12-13 15:42:21 Let's own our government for the people and by the people who are the majority of citizens.  Let's not allow Russia, Saudi Arabia,  Oil Companies, wealthy donors (the minority), NRA etc.  To OWN the USA ---rendering the majority powerless.
4788 2018-12-13 15:42:19 Read this 8 years ago. Ethical Oil: The Case for Canada's Oil Sands by Ezra Levant. Excellent information. This war on Alberta oil sand will not stop if we have the libtard morons in power for 4 more years. They will strangle the industry for good which is their ultimate agenda.
4789 2018-12-13 15:42:18 La cosa triste è che probabilmente finiranno col cedere il testimone ad un altro stuolo di venditori di snake oil disposti ad abbindolare il popolo ingenuo e a tradire il proprio Paese.
4790 2018-12-13 15:42:13 “results” as in: give you 3b and snatch 100b in your tech, land, gems, minerals, oil, agriculture, tourism, Art & culture and labor... and encourage internal strife & wars to deflect attention from you being royally....
4791 2018-12-13 15:42:13 Amongst all the Festive activities, p6/7 learned about Project Management in the Oil Industry & life offshore for a Drilling Supervisor. 
Many thanks to Mr Selvacumarasumy of Ping Petroleum & Mr Flynn of Saudi Aramco. #dywshire
4792 2018-12-13 15:42:06 25% of world oil traffic goes through Hormuz and Bab el Mandeb.  You're gonna let the Iranians have both?

If you cover Yemen, how do you not know this?  It's elementary.
4793 2018-12-13 15:42:02 Ew whatttt I love coconut oil, I use it on my lashes, brows, and dry ends and it DEF works
4794 2018-12-13 15:41:59 Sure the Corporations should pay but so should the oil, mining, etc. workers who have been making 6 figures 4 decades.
4795 2018-12-13 15:41:58 We dont need aids. We need them to withdraw their looting oil thankers and leave Africa for good. These white has and continue to cause alot of atrocities and suffering in Africa not limited to #Ambazonia @Queen_UK @EmmanuelMacron are evil esp to Africa. Stop funding genocite
4796 2018-12-13 15:41:53 Everytime yo black ass get out the car the oil light come on u black ass nigga lol
4797 2018-12-13 15:41:42 That would take me at least 3 sittings. MAYBE 2. Depends on how good the olive oil is.
4798 2018-12-13 15:41:37 {MU} se mantul apa kleveru face oil di kalian?
4799 2018-12-13 15:41:31 These days Iran will get richer selling oil, nothing changed ...
4800 2018-12-13 15:41:28 @KrmHussein Tommorow I have art classes with my 11 y.o. pupils and 12 y.o., they will work something similiar in linocut and print then,I must bring baby oil, even I have it in school glicerine oil they put in tempera, mix with tepmera, but I dont know do I have enough
4801 2018-12-13 15:41:26 The Times had an article this a.m. on how Big Oil pushed back the auto emissions regulations by EPA.
Today's a great day to not buy gas.
4802 2018-12-13 15:41:23 I noticed an oil stain that wasn't washed out on my sweatshirt when I went to go make copies at work this morning. So--in the copy room, mind you--I pulled my arms out, turned it around, and have been rocking a backwards sweatshirt with an oil stain ever since. #classyadult
4803 2018-12-13 15:41:08 Your “whine” industry is catching up to your oil industry.  I’m sure you can get a better deal as a sovereign country.  Look how well Brexit is going.
4804 2018-12-13 15:41:02 They already said what they'll do, go back and watch the interview again.
4805 2018-12-13 15:41:01 I have a friend that owns an electric forklift repair biz.  He does REALLY well and can't find people to hire! It's hard work, but it's in such demand he turns business away.
4806 2018-12-13 15:40:44 The cleansing oil type?

Ederson or Alisson?
Both unreal. Personally feel AB is better because A)He plays for my team, B) His stats don't lie, and C) he wasn't bought with oil money from a state sponsored money laundering scheme devised by murderers draped in black gold.

4816 2018-12-13 15:40:05 Well, that's a twisted explanation for trying to get funds. Just another example of your shyster tactics. You are in the wrong job. You should be a snake oil salesman.
4817 2018-12-13 15:39:58 The doctor prescribed cbd oil so I went to bathroom came out my son was trying to smoke it
4818 2018-12-13 15:39:34 my eyes is burning suddenly i hate olive oil
4819 2018-12-13 15:39:28 Wow the finess here is amazing. Straight up snake oil pitch.
4820 2018-12-13 15:39:28 revealed: every time Orange Hairpiece issues alternative facts, more than one earthling dies a slow emotional death
4821 2018-12-13 15:39:28 The US supported the British embargo but tried throughout 1951-52 to find a solution to the problem that would re-start the flow of Iranian oil; not for the sake of the world market, but for the sake of propping up Iran. It was only in 1953 that regime change became US policy
4822 2018-12-13 15:39:25 Brother my grandparents taught me this at a young age always anointing us with oil and our doorways of our home God bless you for the reminder!!
4823 2018-12-13 15:39:14 Egyptian Amber oil!!! Bih I smell Godly when you step to me 
4824 2018-12-13 15:39:03 How much of this has to do with @irvingoil and the Irving family having a near monopoly of refining in the east plus monopoly on media.  I think there say in PMO's office is quite substantial.  That family alone could destroy the liberal party hence KSA oil continues to flow
4825 2018-12-13 15:39:02 What baffles me is how Canadians in these other provinces fail to see how a strong Alberta and strong oil export industry benefits ALL of Canada!  I am a pro-oil British Columbian and I support Alberta/Sask separation, at this point Trudeau is leaving you little choice.
4826 2018-12-13 15:39:00 I use Cantu products and black castor oil 
4827 2018-12-13 15:38:58 If you drive over a bridge, ride an elevator or board an airplane - coal
was used to make steel, rebar, girders, iron - gas was used to heat, melt, shape, extrude and oil made the road that rubber tires also made from oil rolling along on. Clean Energy can't be built without it
4828 2018-12-13 15:38:55 If you can get peppermint oil do that! Rub it on your temples. It numbs the area. That’s what I do when I get migraines
4829 2018-12-13 15:38:55 what kind of sapphic are you: a charcoal, oil pastel, or colored pencil sapphic?

4833 2018-12-13 15:38:49 this beard oil from @kashmirVIII @DelishCondish is the most festive thing i own
4834 2018-12-13 15:38:46 Thanks for the recommendation! I actually see things for CBD oil/gummies around here quite a bit and I have heard how it works wonders for joint pain, so I'll keep a lookout for it this weekend.
4835 2018-12-13 15:38:41 You can’t slick a can of oil...
4836 2018-12-13 15:38:40 And if you don't like the feeling of hand lotion, their Dry Oil is my husbands favorite. No residue, it soaks in immediately.
4837 2018-12-13 15:38:38 Just one thing to add.   Notley getting her ass handed to her in June will start the rebuilding of AB.  The refinery will cremate jobs and get the oil off rail. And a pipeline east and west will will get the product to market again creating jobs
4838 2018-12-13 15:38:28 The main source of Qatar's wealth is natural gas, not oil. So the proper analogy is Simone having a lot of natural gas, but like the kind in farts.
4839 2018-12-13 15:38:26 Why are nat gas inventory numbers consistently closer to estimates than oil inventory numbers?
4840 2018-12-13 15:38:11 Yes! Deregulate banking, environment, farming, oil drilling but those women uteruses...they need heavy regulation.
4841 2018-12-13 15:38:10 I hate to sell this vehicle! Great running and takes off as soon as you give the gas! I also spent an additional 500.00 on new tires  and replaced brakes in front ,shocks and recent oil change.
4842 2018-12-13 15:38:09 Hasn't the oil industry picked up on the fact they're under the microscope these days?  Covert isn't really possible, and it just alienates those seeking good transition strategies from caring to include big oil.  I'd think they'd be smarter than this.
4843 2018-12-13 15:38:00 Oil 51.83 brlk out or weekly brk down by tomorrow. 53.83 above nxtt. Downside exists 

64min next month..will play afta roll I think

It's just fokn noise
4844 2018-12-13 15:37:52 Defenders oil laga ke jaenge toh hoga yehi... Tumhari team owner aur coach ne toh soch liya ki pradeep jitaega.. defenders chahe 40 min potty karte rahe mat pe... Jeet chuke aise...
4845 2018-12-13 15:37:34 So are you saying no forest where torn down to grow the palm oil purchased by you?
4846 2018-12-13 15:37:19 I have always had oily skin and as a teenager I used to dry tf out of it...astringents, harsh scrubs, washes, etc...just recently discovered this fact and started moisturizing and even oil cleansing and it has helped my skin SO MUCH. Wish I could go back and help 13yo me 
4847 2018-12-13 15:37:14 I have no fear or worry as to whether Delta govt will be able to meet up with promise made to contingents prior to the commencement of the events.. It's an oil producing state and its apparent the state will pay over 100m in cash going by medals garnered so far..
4848 2018-12-13 15:36:43 When they claim, "Buhari blocked leakages for money laundering, blocked oil Wells" I ask, where are d monies now ?  Useless? TSA? Are we buying oil cheaper? Shameless people. 
4849 2018-12-13 15:36:41 Irving oil in New Brunswick has already been doing those upgrades to refine bitumen.
4850 2018-12-13 15:36:37 @elonmusk I’m an ASE master Automotive Technician for 20 years. I pretty much bleed oil and gas and I’m super passionate about EV tech. I own a model 3 and love it. Thank you so much. I also believe in global warming.
4851 2018-12-13 15:36:35 Playoffs started today your Oil would meet my Flames.........How awesome would that be ?? #Please #hellyeah
4852 2018-12-13 15:36:28 You all are surprised the Proud Boys are a thing like 2/3 of the men's grooming products at Target aren't called like "Plessy Ferguson's Ragtime Balls Oil"
4853 2018-12-13 15:36:17 A polishing facial mask, bright indigo, with violet, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating brown sugar. It's sold as a brick wrapped in paper.
4854 2018-12-13 15:36:12 Also a separate Alberta can negotiate with the U.S. to pipe oil to tide water in Washington without interference from Ottawa ie Liberal roadblocks from Trudeau and Butts!
4855 2018-12-13 15:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
4856 2018-12-13 15:35:53 !!!! Has anyone every used CBD oil on here? If so please lmk a good brand to order from !! Thank u !!
4857 2018-12-13 15:35:47 But Saskatchewan and Alberta oil will be penalized by the carbon tax, I guess it seems fair in the mind of this little dictator and his climate change barbie puppet.
4858 2018-12-13 15:35:46 Now all your friends can tell you it's time to get the skanky oil out of your deep frier.
4859 2018-12-13 15:35:44 Overweight piece of talented shit.
He can get better.
4860 2018-12-13 15:35:43 .
You do pay a heavy price as a nation if you don't give up your oil for free.
4861 2018-12-13 15:35:41 I saw a 5-yr-old tell a mall Santa that he wants a #Tesla. Koch brothers & big oil are doomed in the future.
4862 2018-12-13 15:35:38 A lot of oil execs out of work in Texas, also. Conveniently ignored by those who should know better.
4863 2018-12-13 15:35:33 What does the #VITALstudy reveal about Vitamin D & fish oil for your heart health? @DrNieca talks with @BrighamWomens' Dr. JoAnn Manson about the study findings, and what it means for patients!
4864 2018-12-13 15:35:23 Man I got oil every wea
4865 2018-12-13 15:35:13 Uh. CBD oil is available lots of places in the old port. There's a coffee shop on wharf st, where you can get CBD oil right in your drink.

Straight up weed is a different beast. But cbd oil is *everywhere*
4866 2018-12-13 15:35:09 OPEC falling apart was designed as now the oil based usd won’t stand a chance
4867 2018-12-13 15:35:03 So many ants are coming from under the sink in our new room... Last time I wiped the floor with Kaffir Lime essential oil; it was very similar to lemon grass and worked for several days. But they are marching in the room again tonight... #NewTaipeiCity #Taiwan #Taipei #Newlywed
4868 2018-12-13 15:35:03 PALM OIL RAHRAH, CONTROVERSY RAHRAH, SNICKERS BESTESTEST RAHRAH, MY OPINION IS BETTEREST!! yadda, yadda...
lovely post. 
4869 2018-12-13 15:34:54 You think Odessa will ever worry about a dog pound? They don’t care about their roads, schools, housing, illegal immigrants, drugs, inflated cost of living, the homeless, etc., etc.,... Odessa cares about oil. That’s it. They just can’t see that it’s got them no where.
4870 2018-12-13 15:34:51 I suck at coloring and honestly have no energy to learn it. So i guess the oil pastels and acrylic paint i bought for painting class will just go to waste after one time use lol
4871 2018-12-13 15:34:44 also put the gas on low heat. you get more THC without burning the oil/butter
4872 2018-12-13 15:34:41 My 2 followers: "Where can I get Vitamin E?" Heh, good question kiddo. Wheat Germ Oil has 135% DV per serving. Sunflower seeds, almonds, hazelnut oil, fortified cereal, avocados and many more HEALTHY foods @VitaminC
4873 2018-12-13 15:34:41 Forget it with oil, no one anoints anyone anymore. In Exodus 30 verse 22 it is there. I brought oils last weekend and we prayed over it, me and my husband.
4874 2018-12-13 15:34:40 Is Trump pushing to produce more oil and pressuring OPEC to lower oil prices as a way to pay back Putin for helping him get elected?
4875 2018-12-13 15:34:35 I put some “ melaleuca oil for burns on it and threw on a bag of ice & when I picked her up she said “ it’s ok mom, it’s sore a lil....
4876 2018-12-13 15:34:15 but in other products it is still used whilst we continue our research on suitable alternatives. Where palm oil is used, please be assured it’s fully sustainable and certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). [2/2]
4877 2018-12-13 15:34:13 A common example is a private wildlife refuge that allows for the drilling of oil, but because it’s goal is conservation and it would lose donation$ if drillers fucked up, they have stricter scrutiny than gov’t regulation
4878 2018-12-13 15:34:10 Bean oil is still an addictive in many brands of motor oil.
4879 2018-12-13 15:34:01 Hi, palm oil has been used by the food industry for many years but please be assured our research into suitable alternatives continues as we’re keen to do the right thing. We have recently removed palm oil from our potato products [1/2]

4882 2018-12-13 15:33:37 When I think of Marathon, I think of BP. After the BP oil spill all the gas stations that were BP gas stations changed to Marathon gas stations.
4883 2018-12-13 15:33:36 For the normal text books some silica bags in a case is probably fine, though for the book I posted I'm not sure, it's a book of sketches, paintings charcoals and oil pastel art, so there's a lot of different needs going on lol.. Will need to research a bit.
4884 2018-12-13 15:33:29 .@westerncaucus There needs to be an accounting of the total acres that were withdrawn from mining, oil and gas exploration during the Obama Admin. Each of these withdrawals need to be reviewed and any found without merit need to be rescinded. Stop the land grabs. @Unitedminingal

4888 2018-12-13 15:33:10 Twitter pressured me into getting my oil changed
4889 2018-12-13 15:33:07 Did a double take when I read this.  This guy has no limit to his snake oil.
4890 2018-12-13 15:33:00 Mexico's new president announced new oil plan. He could have a good start as 7 oil fields could come online in the next years. Many of them hold light grade reserves, very valuable for refining in #Mexico which requires diluents for the heavy Maya grade. 

#amlo #pemex #energy
4891 2018-12-13 15:32:59 The kids will know that it is people like her that are the reason why they can't have nice things like the kids in other jurisdictions where people like her did not destroy the local oil industry. I would be careful suggesting pitch forks, never know who ends up getting stabbed.
4892 2018-12-13 15:32:58 Federal budget

2012 (N160 / $)
N4.9 trillion = $30.6 billion

2017 (N360 / $)
N7.5 trillion = $20.8 billion

The devaluation of the naira plus the drop in oil revenue contributed to an overall FALL in the real value of our budget, despite rising in naira terms from N4.9 - 7.5 T.
4893 2018-12-13 15:32:57 I hope my kids hair texture never changes like mine did. I miss those days where all I needed was a little bit of water, brush, and some oil to put It up in a ponytail. Now I need a prayer to God 
4894 2018-12-13 15:32:56 #crude Crude oil prices are drifting lower on Thursday, after a report from the IEA said crude output by OPEC members rose in November on the back of record pumping from Saudi Arabia.

4897 2018-12-13 15:32:35 Ah yes, can't wait to figure that out given the recent internal trade spats we've had while still a part of confederation. Glad we started with the hard stuff: beer. Oil and grains should be easy peasy.

4911 2018-12-13 15:31:11 Omo this guy need help!!!!. See thinking in 2018!
4912 2018-12-13 15:31:11 @CapEconEmerging "The OPEC meeting concluded last Friday with a deal to cut oil output but we don’t think that this will provide a lasting boost to oil prices and, overall, the deal is set to result in slower GDP growth in the Gulf."
4913 2018-12-13 15:31:10 I think the thing for me personally is that being from SK where it’s accepted practice and now living in NS where it’s not and to hear people wanting an increase in federal transfer payments puzzles me as oil and gas is where that money comes from.
4914 2018-12-13 15:31:10 Car needs a little work front wheel bearing, front stabilizer end links. New oil pan installed this summer and new battery within last 6 months.  Aftermarket wheels with Firestone Winter force snows. Reasonable offers considered. Cash only
4915 2018-12-13 15:31:05 Jason should go back to Ottawa & play politics there. That's where he is from & I'm surprised Albertans are so gullible to this snake oil salesman from the east.
4916 2018-12-13 15:30:58 Ironic that Quebecers upset with VIA choosing Siemens over Bombardier but fine with choosing Saudi oil over Alberta oil.

4938 2018-12-13 15:28:51 Well, we’ll have to see what evidence they have. I hope for their sakes there’s more behind it than in the many GOP Benghazi and email investigations that didn’t come up with anything. 

BTW, how about that Trump Foundation? Did the oil portrait of Trump end up feeding the poor?

4940 2018-12-13 15:28:35 It’s absolutely incredible how naive and idealistic Canadians are concerning our energy sector. While climate change is real and must be addressed our country is far from economically sound. Not to mention $$$ from oil can be used to invest in renewables for the eventual handoff.

4963 2018-12-13 15:25:59 Albertans and almost everyone in the oil and gas sector didn’t want the Feds to buy pipeline.  They wanted the Feds to cut the bullshit and get it across the finish line without the tumultuous delays of eco-terrorists
4964 2018-12-13 15:25:39 I know it's aspirational to think cutting carbs + lots of protein is an automatic cure-all. But not so simple, so I suspect many patients get discouraged (weight drop is quick; other corrections may take longer). Have been no grain/no seed oil for probably 2 decades. /end
4965 2018-12-13 15:25:30 Fossil fuel proponent just argued on #CBC Radio against constraints on Canada oil patch b/o supposed economic impacts on oil industry. But 25% of #petroleum is used for chemicals & synthetics. Stop burning that stuff & keep precious oil for other uses!
4966 2018-12-13 15:25:06 "Mr. Heminger... was already counting the extra barrels of fuel a Trump rollback would mean for the industry: 350,000 to 400,000 barrels of gasoline per day."
@MarathonOil @Koch_Industries @exxonmobil 
These entities are about market dominance and continuing our reliance on oil.
4967 2018-12-13 15:24:59 There are some interesting opportunities out there. 

I think oil is setting up nicely for a big rally.  Things can always change, but the glut will eventually clear.

4978 2018-12-13 15:24:01 There is whole lecture I could go on about this regarding oil and Saudi Arabia.
Suffice to say we are now a net oil exporter, and only back the saudis out of a desire for regional stability.

4989 2018-12-13 15:22:56 its all about oil, absolutely
4990 2018-12-13 15:22:39 UN is a puppet of the US. They give arms,  food n medicine the US siphones oil.
4991 2018-12-13 15:22:24 Wind power doesn’t have nearly the energy density as oil. Also, why waste a strategic resource that’s already developed and productive if political handcuffs are taken off. 
4992 2018-12-13 15:22:22 cbd oil cartridges taste like ur chewing on incense
4993 2018-12-13 15:22:20 Sweet almond oil after a shower feels so good 
4994 2018-12-13 15:22:17 Socialism & the welfare state have us 0n the path to Venezuela north. Chavez nationalized their oil & didn’t have a clue you & your little buddy are shutting down the oils industry. So short sighted & stupid!
4995 2018-12-13 15:22:17 
4996 2018-12-13 15:22:16 We’re ready to keep working on clean policies. @ncelenviro has supported what we’ve been focusing on regarding oil reserves, drilling, hydraulic fracking, bounties, etc. Help us understand what we should continue working on re: coal ash. I supported positive measures last session
4997 2018-12-13 15:22:15 Oil is easily testable to check if it is really oil. False data cannot be easily identified.
4998 2018-12-13 15:22:14 Hate to break it to you but oil money is waaaaaaaay more lucrative than anything @SierraClub has to offer
4999 2018-12-13 15:22:06 I love foxes! They make the best hats
5000 2018-12-13 15:22:00 KSA & UAE have contributed most in this humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Bombing innocent unarmed Yemni civilians & arming terrorists to kill civilians and to takeover Yemeni oil fields and illegally invading a country despite these facts How evil ur to do such tweets full of lies
5001 2018-12-13 15:22:00 seeing watercolor and oil demos on Adobe #ProjectGemini have me feeling “okay, so it’s a better UI than ArtRage & Mischief, but the tools are creating the same effect that these apps have had for at least half a decade. The oils especially look similar to a handful of software.”

5005 2018-12-13 15:21:42 ES still in Dec as vol is still there. Oil is Jan for same reason
5006 2018-12-13 15:21:27 It was also very satisfying to sneak up to a rival gang camp with full dead-eye, and pop them all before they knew what hit them. 

Particularly since the first shot hit an oil lantern and so the whole thing started with a dazzling explosion of fire.
5007 2018-12-13 15:21:22 #Wife introduced me to putting eucalyptus oil in the shower to help  when I'm stuffy in the mornings and it's changed my life.
5008 2018-12-13 15:21:19 Coal and oil industry still exist. It still provide at least 90% energy in America and the world. How about energy diversity? You can develop renewable energy while fossil fuel energy can still be used.

5014 2018-12-13 15:20:53 how does changing the oil of a car take over an hour??? this has never been a problem until today bc these people in this waiting room can’t speak at a normal conversational volume.
5015 2018-12-13 15:20:48 For me, it's not terrifically unreal to watch a professional snake oil salesman be exposed in real time

It's far more unreal to watch a captive audience of Americans witness it and say, "Yeah, we're still glad we bought that snake oil, and we'd buy it again"
5016 2018-12-13 15:20:39 We ARE, due to our fabulous PRESIDENT, not dependent on foreign oil NOW. He IS MAGA.
5017 2018-12-13 15:20:30 Oil ripping up now.

5020 2018-12-13 15:20:17 At Mar-a-Lago, Lindsey Graham reluctantly explains to President Trump that oil executives are probably contagious. An obsequious reporter proposes marriage.

5025 2018-12-13 15:19:33 I bet the kcal’s in the publlished menus are low by hundreds of kcal.  Eg, for the official kcal measurement sautéed veggies they use 1 tsp olive oil, but in real life heat of the moment prep cooks splash in the oil its probably double or triple.  In every dish.

5041 2018-12-13 15:18:04 Just a reflection of the drop in oil prices, their biggest import.

5044 2018-12-13 15:17:45 Develop your shale oil on the west coast of Newfoundland. Lift the hydraulic fracturing pause. Develop the 30 billion barrels of oil. If the federal government is supporting hydraulic fracturing on the west coast it should mean it’s safe.
5045 2018-12-13 15:17:43 Left early for my doctor's appointment and still managed to get there half an hour late due to traffic.  Had to reschedule.  But at least I was finally able to get my oil changed..

5057 2018-12-13 15:16:55 Nope.  Wrong.    In fact Trump gave lethal weapons to neighboring countries.  In fact the boom in oil production alone has been a death knell for Russia’s economy.  The #fakenews democrats.

5066 2018-12-13 15:15:56 Fuel price couldn't have been brought down due to Fiscal deficit. The oil prices are low now, i think it'll be brought down during elections.. #VoteForBJP #BJP4India

5069 2018-12-13 15:15:43 I suspect dealing with Najaf/Anbar double uprising taxed the Army more than people want to admit. Turn the dial to 11 and we'd have issues in oil rich North all the way down to Basra. Presumably Iraq's neighbors would swoop in.
5070 2018-12-13 15:15:41 & oil.  Oil is a “natural resource” as is natural gas.  Both of which will be replaced when it is economically beneficial to develop alternatives.   That’s how a free market works in developing new technologies & ideas.
5071 2018-12-13 15:15:40 I’m at an instant oil change place for the first time in my life and let me just say.... this is a BLAST
5072 2018-12-13 15:15:39 Indeed.  Try CBD oil. It's not perfect, but it does help. It's not $400 month, but it's not cheap either.

5076 2018-12-13 15:15:10 Oil leak before 1st oil change. Wasn't put back together right, blew up within a mile. (The oil was blown all over engine compartment) All Ford would do was extend warranty. Now having trans issues. Think it's trans. Front end jumps when you take off, after a 20+ mile trip.
5077 2018-12-13 15:15:07 aaaa thank you so much maru!! this means a whole lot especially coming from you, your detailing and textured oil paintings are astounding!

5082 2018-12-13 15:14:18 They specifically said there is no " social acceptability for oil" in that province. And they are doing everything they can to block pipelines. Doesnt seem like a pro oil gov't to me. I would love for that entire fucking province to just go away

5090 2018-12-13 15:13:46 Don't be sad. Does smoking have an effect on your short term memory? If it does, try adding CBD oil to your daily regimen. It helps. Have a blessed and lifted day Mags.

5092 2018-12-13 15:13:30 You want to see "rigged"? Most of those 30 years were under a PC government that was captured by the oil industry.
5093 2018-12-13 15:13:27 It looks wonderful. Is that dan dan noodles? In which case the ‘brown stuff on top’ is probably minced beef or pork quickly stir fried in a hot wok or pan in a drop of oil with a little rice wine and then a spoon of hoisin.
5094 2018-12-13 15:13:27 @jacksoncrompton nice publicity play. You do realize that oil and gas account for only 21% of Canada’s GHGs, right? Transportation is 25%, electricity and buildings another 22%. I bet letters to YVR and transporters are on the way. I know where I will not be visiting this summer!
5095 2018-12-13 15:13:25 @oil if you want these guys to stop protesting take away there tobacco
5096 2018-12-13 15:13:18 Def not wise words from Legault. He should first of all praise Alberta for having oil production so Quebec can have a high living standard. Then he should have used his words more wisely if he is for oil production. Using phrase «dirty oil» he sounds more socialist than Trudeau!
5097 2018-12-13 15:13:17 Hey Jason, you and Harper were the ones that included ALBERTA OIL REVENUE IN FORMULA....
5098 2018-12-13 15:13:17 No I got that but it’s not BAD for you right?? It’s just... oil lol
5099 2018-12-13 15:13:16 I’d like to suggest that Alberta pay equalization to Quebec in barrels of oil, delivered in the manner of their choice

5118 2018-12-13 15:11:23 We have oil and natural gas what are you talking?
5119 2018-12-13 15:11:11 The continued fragmenting on both the supply and demand sides has created a system of complexity where IMO we are one rogue trading algo or one misfired rocket away from a oil shock on any given day.
And that risk only increases each year.
5120 2018-12-13 15:11:09 Much needed lip oil for Simba and I. My special mix of homemade cold pressed peppermint coconut oil plus other oils to stimulate those blood cells for rejuvenation.

5122 2018-12-13 15:10:48 Actually cried after your magnificent speech @TeaLeoni.

5131 2018-12-13 15:09:57 I once mentioned oil, and a great industry was formed in this province!
5132 2018-12-13 15:09:49 That's his leadership aspirations in the dustbin. Put money in Jeremy Hunt, he's non committal and sounds brilliant in front of a mic. Whether he has any substance is another matter. The middle classes and MSM love clean cut snake oil salesman like Clegg and Cameron.
5133 2018-12-13 15:09:25 Over six different ones have been found in one company’s oil alone
5134 2018-12-13 15:09:16 We should all boycott anything from Quebec. It’s fueled by dictatorship oil anyways.

5143 2018-12-13 15:08:13 Yeah, add Carbon risk to the decreasing cohesion in global oil trading system top to bottom - from macro pressures on the petro-dollar, destabilizing Opec, etc - continued depletion of conventional reserves, w/ further dependence on a debt-cycled non-conventional...
5144 2018-12-13 15:08:11 I live in Alberta which is oil country. Those jobs are becoming more and more automated. It's going to leave a huge gap that will leave many in that industry unemployed.

5153 2018-12-13 15:06:36 Called the oil change place and asked if I needed to make an appointment...
5154 2018-12-13 15:06:28 That isn't how equalization works, Quebec doesn't buy oil. Saudi oil goes to private companies. Now Alberta wanted the National Energy Program gone and the Mulroney Conservatives obliged. Short sighted as the pipelines would be built, we would be energy independent and Cdn owned
5155 2018-12-13 15:06:20 You obviously didn't read the article - its the oil industry not car makers.
5156 2018-12-13 15:06:16 LMFAOOO! we are in the same boat, consistent use of coconut oil mixed with virgin olive oil to seal the moisture in has helped though.
5157 2018-12-13 15:06:13 I forgot to take my oil pen out of my purse before coming to the airport and have now just noticed...as I am sitting in the aircraft #oops
5158 2018-12-13 15:06:11 Data is the new oil. Your information, your browsing habits, your @facebook profile, your @google accounts, is the new oil. The most valuable thing on this planet is your data.
5159 2018-12-13 15:06:10 $2.79 is still cheap for us. But that’s crazy. I guess that’s what you get for being right on an oil field.
5160 2018-12-13 15:06:03 Sorry siomai rice Chicken oil and Sinigang soup is the best hehe
5161 2018-12-13 15:06:01 I work on oil rigs, but there is big shrimping, oyster, and fishing industry here, you can troll in the bayous or the open water before the gulf in season, year round 3 miles and further from land in the gulf, seafood ALWAYS good here, get it all fresh off the boats as they dock
5162 2018-12-13 15:05:53 Dear child,

Santa will be safe at Trump tower! I have relocated him since I need his house to drill for oil in the Arctic.

5163 2018-12-13 15:05:34 I hate getting oil changes
5164 2018-12-13 15:05:26 We gotta wash our hair, deep condition for hours, wash it again, detangle, then oil it, braid/twist it, PRAY it’s dry the next day, untwist it, then style it. If it’s not dry I’m shaving my shit off and then having a meltdown. I AM NOT DOING THAT EVERYDAY.

5167 2018-12-13 15:05:07 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
5168 2018-12-13 15:04:48 Between garlic and black truffle oil, salt, truffles themselves my insides probably smell like somebody’s back yard
5169 2018-12-13 15:04:40 The best thing one can say about 45 is that he is a accomplished snake oil salesman.
5170 2018-12-13 15:04:28 I think you have swallowed too much project fear! Many of our oil products come from the far East, only made higher in cost from EU tariffs  same with food brought in from outside the Union 

The EU is a protection racket and not a free market as you are lead to believe!
5171 2018-12-13 15:04:27 Oil traders should be hitting some targets here.
5172 2018-12-13 15:04:22 @McloughlinOil Purchased some oil on your website. It requested credit card details, but the said that payment would be on delivery.  Why ask for credit card details if payment is on delivery?
5173 2018-12-13 15:04:03 I remember like over a year ago @tayallard tweeted about throwing out your tweezer and using castor oil on your brows/lashes everyday and at the time I was like “what no”,  but look at me now, haven’t tweezed my brows in 6 months and I’m THRIVING
5174 2018-12-13 15:04:00 I'm sure he is diversified with oil....
5175 2018-12-13 15:03:56 Depending on the type of hair, it will have more natural oils, which will make it softer and shinier. Unless you have oily hair to start with, like me, which requires every day washing, otherwise I look like I rolled in the cooking oil
5176 2018-12-13 15:03:52 And with renewables being cheaper...makes you wonder if oil and gas companies are taking advantage of our economy too.
5177 2018-12-13 15:03:43 So many good lines in that scene:
"I will marry a round American woman. I will raise rabbits. And she will cook them for me."
5178 2018-12-13 15:03:42 재밌게 놀다오십셔^^!
5179 2018-12-13 15:03:41 So you would rather send our money to Saudi Arabia then to Alberta to purchase oil? or is it the transit of the oil. You would rather send oil in ships across the ocean then pipelines? Ships are much more pron to accidents and env disasters.
5180 2018-12-13 15:03:38 It’s a very good cream makeup. It has a softer consistency than most pro cream foundations (more oil, less wax) so it sheers out easily. If you want medium to full coverage, you’ll need to layer it.

5183 2018-12-13 15:03:18 Hi There, Sorry about this, the picture was required in order for us to advise further. Regarding the sticker, I would suggest to use multiple purpose oil and I will forward your feedback to our warehouse for future reference. Thanks, Betty.

politician are elected to improve the voters live not to win likes on facebook.
5186 2018-12-13 15:03:06 @SigmaBeauty  gutted to see palm oil as an ingredient in your foam brush cleaner 
5187 2018-12-13 15:03:01 If all Canada is to Albertans is a net benefit about oil & pipelines, that does not speak well of Albertans. for the record many in BC are pro pipeline. But rather than address people’s legitimate concerns it seems you want to just leave. Good luck getting your oil out then
5188 2018-12-13 15:02:57 You can't, surely, be suggesting that Brexit's partially driven by external interests, suspicious oil money, and will end in cosmic horror?

5195 2018-12-13 15:02:12 Suncor and imperial make money from refining oil.  Cenovus has us refineries, Husky has been selling cdn assets for awhile.   Cnrl has ineternational production.    To make it seem like these companies make their money in Canada production is false.

5204 2018-12-13 15:01:21 Well if that didnt seal my idea to make UN blue helmets to use as target practice then I dont know what else could
5205 2018-12-13 15:01:18 Nothing shadier than oil change shops.

5210 2018-12-13 15:01:06 naturally you can cheap out a bit by mixing olive oil with veg oil etc
5211 2018-12-13 15:01:05 Maybe you should read more. As far as I can tell, Putin installed 45* to lift sanctions so multibillion oil deal could go, foreign policy being run corruptly, authoritarian rule is here.
5212 2018-12-13 15:01:02 Where are you getting that figure from????? that's not right
OK imported food will range from 10 to 40% more expensive for starters also other things like cars, electronics even petrol and oil products. It's the "division 4" of trade arrangements.

5214 2018-12-13 15:00:52 So, I try to really limit how much of the midnight oil I'm burning without it being a true necessity otherwise those time constraints get leaky and I am less productive...
5215 2018-12-13 15:00:48 Oil is part of our day to day life, “Without oil and natural gas, Canadians would leave the house in the morning, unshaven, smelly, and generally disheveled. Probably without shoes or boots on because they require oil.” /3
5216 2018-12-13 15:00:44 Usual 'arappu' (of coconut, jeerakam, green chillies) added to cooked potatoes and hard boiled eggs (all chopped lengthwise). Add salt, turmeric, chilli powder & yoghurt to taste. And lace with coconut oil & kariveppila. Not v Mallu but I love this with hot puffy chappatis.
5217 2018-12-13 15:00:43 1st change since I bought my Beetle in July, hopefully it will be quick. Also they had a coupon for a free tire rotation. Never used a dealership do an oil change before, but it's better than Jiffy Lube. Cheaper, too.
5218 2018-12-13 15:00:40 He added: “Governments that talk in terms of managing the transition away from the oil industry and moving to an alternative economy are not the ones you want in charge of building pipelines and getting our resources to market.”/2
5219 2018-12-13 15:00:37 You and your clown shoes government are aware the teeny tiny footprint Canada leaves right? That if others don’t change we still won’t matter? Oh and we have ethical oil?

5225 2018-12-13 15:00:16 CAFE standards were enacted in the 1970s in response to the Energy Crisis and dependence on OPEC oil. The US is now the world’s #1 oil producer. So why do CAFE standards still exist? Do Democrats just have an obsessive need to boss around the auto industry?
5226 2018-12-13 15:00:15 What you been putting in it ? You need to get some type of natural oil
5227 2018-12-13 15:00:14 peel all your garlic, cover with olive oil plus a little extra, add any aromatics you want in too (thyme? chili? bay), simmer on a low low heat for 30-60 minutes until the garlic is soft but not browned
5228 2018-12-13 15:00:09 I never wanted to challenge it myself, so I always hosed myself down with lavender oil before venturing into wild places. The towns and cities are pretty well-controlled for mosquitoes.

5230 2018-12-13 15:00:06 From when I started shorting $SPX, $TLRY and $Oil roughly one week ago, the entire position is up a combined 53% 

Biggest gainer was $TLRY (which fell 10% yesterday), it falling so much signals to me that market is starting to liquidate toxic positions in anticipation of a crash
5231 2018-12-13 15:00:03 No kidding re $!  Ha!
After college, I worked for top execs in oil industry as Exec. Assistant & was involved with legal matters.
I fell in love with the law and became a Legal Assistant.

That was the moment my "UN should be dismantled" take went from hyperbole to my true position. 

It was a while ago, I think during either WJC or GWB admin.
5237 2018-12-13 14:59:19 Now you're opening up even more errors. 
1) Palm oil, not just Asia. Unrelated anyways, since it was a jab at CNN for irony, not you?
2) Maybe we have different views of "Midwest"? 
3) Do you make a habit of arguing with people you mostly agree with?
5238 2018-12-13 14:59:14 Once I was hired to do an oil painting, the guy wanted to only pay 1/3 of the price because he felt it wasn't worth it. As I was walking away with my painting a woman saw it and fell in love with it.  I gave it to her for free, totally worth it.  #ArtMoments
5239 2018-12-13 14:59:08 He probably doesn’t know how to change oil either

5245 2018-12-13 14:58:31 Massive pressure to enter into the world of car manufacturing where many have failed. Throw in the fact the company is an EV maker going up against Big Oil and the ICE, it makes even more challenging. Got to be some epic pressure all around in trying to succeed.
5246 2018-12-13 14:58:24 you end up with a load of garlicky oil and soft cooked garlic (a bit like roasted garlic) that can go on bread or under chicken skin or in mashed veg etc. under oil in a sealed container it will keep for months

5262 2018-12-13 14:57:04 CBD oil has a reported side effect of drowsiness for some people which, when used in coordination with the other substances she had reportedly taken (alcohol, prescription and OTC sleep medication), can have an impact on her ability to drive.
5263 2018-12-13 14:57:01 But only the squeaky wheel gets oil 
5264 2018-12-13 14:57:01 That makes it sound personal, but the U.S. has backed the Saudi state for decades for the oil - and it's always been brutal.

5274 2018-12-13 14:56:20 I suppose but with the oil industry complaining about 18 dollar crude... A buck twenty four diesel seems a bit steep

5286 2018-12-13 14:55:12 Thanks. Looking at pictures of beautiful supernatural BC. Won’t  be supernatural BC for much longer with disens if football field sized oil tankers rammed into Vancouver’s small port and dilbit sludge filling once salmon spawning rivers. Thanks Justin.

5302 2018-12-13 14:54:09 Transparent and honest?

5310 2018-12-13 14:52:52 With a lot of stewards / police it feels like they want to show power. Hoping that nothing will happen because you fear them then. In the end it is like trying to put out a fire with oil.

5312 2018-12-13 14:52:47 I didn’t like the last goal he let in but they say that he has an injury. He’s been pretty good the last few. What I like is even with a few pieces missing we still are in first in the west. The Oil are doing the best they can and squeaking a few wins out.

5322 2018-12-13 14:51:54 That you don’t know the answer to this is why Dems are gushing over a milquetoast neoliberal who takes oil executive money, votes against discontinuing expanding off-shore drilling & hasn’t signed onto #MedicareForAll.

5419 2018-12-13 14:43:48 Truly, there’s the rub. Addicted do not admit to themselves or tell others crackhouses have no locks on door. Don’t believe able to walk out on our own legs. Chain smokers don’t reduce carbon footprint on their pulmonary tract. We got to build replacement for shale gas&oil now
5420 2018-12-13 14:43:46 I am absolutely thrilled to see this support coming openly from our First Nations legitimately elected Chiefs who are the actual leaders of the First Nations.Their support for the oil sands and the necessary pipelines to export our products at world prices is absolutely wonderful
5421 2018-12-13 14:43:45 I sweat if these guys pull out my air filter and show it to me I'm going to lose my shit in front of everyone here.

5473 2018-12-13 14:39:48 How long until damages can be proven in court?  If we can attribute weather events to climate change and Big Oil has admitted for 40+ years that they are responsible for and aware of the consequences of climate change... are we there yet?

5501 2018-12-13 14:37:52 Government didn't reduce tax rate when oil prices dropped but I believe govt generates more USD from oil taxes with higher oil prices than when the prices are lower.

5550 2018-12-13 14:33:42 No problem hun. I had a coworker that doesn’t believe in dinosaurs and thinks that God just put the oil there.......oh and that earthquakes happened cuz they were a warning for the end of days
5551 2018-12-13 14:33:33 鉄壁で耐えて下さいw
5552 2018-12-13 14:33:22 WTI Midland is more or less $7 lower than WTI Cushing... that's around breakeven price for US shale oil
5553 2018-12-13 14:33:22 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 21,55 ευρώ με άνοδο 1,89% όγκο 126 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 2,38 δισ. ευρώ
5554 2018-12-13 14:33:21 I see a picture. Sea salt + rosemary on flatbread. I see parmesan in comments. Any oil? Temp?
5555 2018-12-13 14:33:18 It's the oil, dipshit
5556 2018-12-13 14:33:17 Something like a third of your funding comes from the oil industry.
Of course it might be more, as it was discovered in 2006 that it was  funneled through a charity, then through the University of Calgary then into an "education trust" so who knows.
5557 2018-12-13 14:33:14 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
5558 2018-12-13 14:32:55 I don’t even think i can manage this shit in between the two weeks after you do it . Like this shit is not it Kay  you just gone have to do my hot oil treatments and manage my relaxed hair .
5559 2018-12-13 14:32:53 So Saudi oil is clean?
5560 2018-12-13 14:32:49 You’re talking about a man who has absolutely ZERO legislative accomplishments as a member of the European Parliament. 

The only way Nigel Farage stood out was by having one of the WORST attendance records over there. 

He’s the textbook snake oil salesman & fraud.
5561 2018-12-13 14:32:44 姉歯せよ～～～～～wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
5562 2018-12-13 14:32:42 Quebec declares our Alberta oil as socially unacceptable, but is totally fine dumping millions of gallons of raw shit in a water body.

They’re totally fine buying oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia, the US. But not us.
5563 2018-12-13 14:32:39 Yeah you gotta be careful with the oil level cause it will make it super soggy, best is have just enough to come up to the edges but not submerge the egg

5568 2018-12-13 14:32:24 I got castor oil/coconut oil on my head I’m letting it rlly soak in 
5569 2018-12-13 14:32:24 and of course palm oil production is totally fine because of the huge profit margins. why are climate change 'experts' only interested in solutions that make them richer?
5570 2018-12-13 14:32:23 THAT'S NOT MOTOR OIL!
5571 2018-12-13 14:32:13 And BP Oil is paying my mortgage.

5576 2018-12-13 14:31:46 with lots of oil ??
5577 2018-12-13 14:31:45 I need my car washed, oil changed, air in my tire, and I think something is wrong with my brakes 
5578 2018-12-13 14:31:40 Thank you to everyone who participated in the Food for Oil Drive this November! The Thomas Tire Team had the chance to deliver donations to several local food banks including the  The Salvation Army of Asheboro, NC, The Salvation Army of Greensboro, and the Harvest Baptist Church
5579 2018-12-13 14:31:40 Wheres the flakes in veg oil??
5580 2018-12-13 14:31:39 Yes. BP supplies feedstock and sells 80% of yield, the remaining 20% being sold within USVI. Unsure of quality of oil. However at full capacity the refinery does have coking, so heavy sour possible if they do full restart.
5581 2018-12-13 14:31:38 like Everywhere, our politician speek for us without realy asking what we think... it is the case here...it is lefties manipulation to think that blocking a pipeline will stop the use of oil.......

5584 2018-12-13 14:31:37 やっぱり赤いーーーwwwwwww
5585 2018-12-13 14:31:35 The people who swear coconut oil is a cure all to everything and swear it’s doing wonders for their skin
5586 2018-12-13 14:31:22 Unreal! Describe that world? Is that where you are insulated from the worst crimes against humanity committed under your terms? Insulated by rich white people you helped bail out during the GR while over 5m lost their homes? Increasing oil profits by making fracking a policy? 
5587 2018-12-13 14:31:19 How is supporting drilling for oil in a national wildlife refuge in 2018 heroic?
5588 2018-12-13 14:31:10 Shall we do an oil mixing video today? Yule oil.
5589 2018-12-13 14:31:10 Try CBD oil. My cat was diagnosed with lymphoma in February and given a 2-3 month prognosis without doing chemo, and he’s still with me, healthy as ever. Even if it doesn’t help the cancer, it helps with pain, anxiety, and appetite; would help make his last days more comfortable.
5590 2018-12-13 14:30:59 Beto sucks pass it on. Unless you’re down with six figure big oil campaign contributions. #GreenNewDeal #MedicareForAll #BetoIsNoProgressive
5591 2018-12-13 14:30:55 The way the @EdmontonOilers are playing great defence under new coach Ken Hitchcock, I think the Oil has a fantastic chance that they can finally make a deep Cup run this time around which I am not saying that they will be but I really like their chances this year. #LetsGoOilers
5592 2018-12-13 14:30:55 Jamaican castor oil is my go to for all hair growth. I put some on my lashes every night. And a diet rich in amino acids
5593 2018-12-13 14:30:44 We had no good news ?? Come on...1) The outage in Libya (that is almost 400k bpd) 2) Record oil imports from China 3) US crude inventories drawing for two weeks in a row 4) The Buzzard field in the North Sea is still out (150k bpd but planned to be back online soon).

5597 2018-12-13 14:30:22 So how did you take them down?
5598 2018-12-13 14:30:16 เขาก็ดีจริงๆนะ แต่แฟนนางงาอย่างนี้ก็เพลียอ่ะ 555
5599 2018-12-13 14:30:15 We generally know where the oil is, and it takes time and tech to develop the extraction techniques to make accessing the oil at market-viable prices.  That lead is more than the year and a half of the snake-oil salesman in chief.
5600 2018-12-13 14:30:12 US commercial crude oil inventories (ex-SPR) decreased by 1.2M barrels during wk ending Dec 7, 2018, from previous week. $USO $XLE $XOP $OIH
5601 2018-12-13 14:30:09 like controlling the media, nationalization of pipelines to control oil, like taxes on citizens in the guise of climate change, looking at citizens bank accounts, having no boarders, giving tax exemptions to major corporations & industry polluters, subsidies for the rich corps

5604 2018-12-13 14:29:38 It’s icy out, and I almost slid my roustabout truck into an OIL TANKER. 
 So that’s how my morning is going....
5605 2018-12-13 14:29:35 I am trading oil, and oil only, for the last 25 years. I wish you a wonderful and profitable day.
5606 2018-12-13 14:29:30 I’m sorry but Big Oil? You mean the product that has powered the world for the last 150 years that allows us to travel to work fly around the world and generally allows humans a standard of living unheard of in human history. I’m assuming you dont fly or use a car ever correct?
5607 2018-12-13 14:29:27 353.00 for a yearly maintenance. However within that year I have to do oil changes which is another 60.00 then fill it with gas and pay the lease. I'm starting to see why a vehicle is a luxury. #poor
5608 2018-12-13 14:29:24 ini berapaan emg kim hanbin di syopi? lbh mahal dr micellar oil yg 400ml g?
5609 2018-12-13 14:29:18 Your a snake oil salesman..
5610 2018-12-13 14:28:44 We completely got lost as nation btw 2007-2015.
We earned so much from crude oil exports, but we spent so much of it(trillion of Naira) on (imported)fuel subsidies. A huge economic loss,  wastages and creation of JOBs ABROAD, no INFRASTRUCTURE built to support the growing economy
5611 2018-12-13 14:28:31 Let's SHUT DOWN BIG OIL, and return to the pre-petroleum days when life expectancy in the US was 39, 3 out of 10 kids died B4 the age of 5, & city streets were covered with 6 inches of horse poop, yaayyy! #BrightFuture #ILoveFossilFuels @AlexEpstein #maga #tcot #teaparty

5614 2018-12-13 14:28:17 Lol, did you pour oil on your face
5615 2018-12-13 14:28:16 You posited that the oil boom came because of the incompetent buffoon in the White House. I showed that the cycle of increased production started under the previous admin, and that the jump didn't "just happen" as you would have us believe.

5623 2018-12-13 14:27:26 Think it's ominous , rally or not, that the OSX, has now undercut the 2009 lows when the SPX hit 666 low?  OSX, leads the oil price, which, in turn, leads the World economy in direction in the past.
5624 2018-12-13 14:27:18 Aye, they want us all scared. So they can extort more 'green' taxes from us, which end up where? Right into the hands of the very people who foisted oil & environment destruction upon us. The IPCC are a bunch of data faking crooks, as revealed in wikileaks #climategate leaks 2011
5625 2018-12-13 14:27:10 great speech. I hope Senate makes further progress on how one balances all the provinces, territories, FN rights when, more & more, the environment and land itself is also recognized as a resource. Some in BC feel their land/environment is as much a resource as oil is to Alberta.

5627 2018-12-13 14:27:07 The expansion isn't even supposed to carry crude oil, it's for diluted bitumen, a much less useful, and much harder to clean up petroleum product. This will have zero impact on our oil production because it's not oil.

5649 2018-12-13 14:24:49 Only problem is that the oil and gas workers do their job spirit. They insist on making everything back the way it was. The Whoville people did not.

5653 2018-12-13 14:24:14 I believe BTC's properties are similar to the laws of thermodynamics.  Energy into storage of value.

Sun to plants to produce Oil

Sun to electricity to mine BTC

Thermodynamics, the stars keep the Universe alive.

Stars, the source of all value

5655 2018-12-13 14:24:07 According to some people, saying that a tire rotation is the same price as an oil change means I told the customer that the tire rotation is included in the price.
5656 2018-12-13 14:24:05 when the world starts adding tens of thousands of electric cars per week to the market, this trend will only accelerate. Only risk if oil companies stop investing in exploration and drilling and something nasty happens with oil price on our way down.

Check out information about essential oils. It is helping to keep sicknesses in my house at bay and helping tremendously to get us over colds. Peppermint oil in a carrier oil and rubbed on the feet is super helpful for those suffering from colds.
5668 2018-12-13 14:23:14 ever heard of oil filter replacements
5669 2018-12-13 14:23:13 So by separating you think it will help getting oil to market? That would make it worse not better. Pretty much the worst idea ever.
5670 2018-12-13 14:22:57 So oil is not dirty nor is its harvesting or production?

5708 2018-12-13 14:20:07 Comparing absolute GDP figures in two periods might be misleading for our economy that’s mostly driven by oil price. For the two years
1. Drop in oil price, and
2.Fall in value of NAIRA
impacted the absolute figures.
If those factors remained same ok to compare absolutes.

5714 2018-12-13 14:19:39 "promise government for the people, and deliver benefits for wealthy."
LOL Yeah, because helping the Standard Oil/ Rockefeller Family landlock our oil industry so they can continue holding a North American monopoly and buy our oil dirt cheap, it's helping the rich at all...

5733 2018-12-13 14:18:23 Do you think we could ship any more oil across the boarder to collect those tax revenues? How do we pay for a military? Roads? Schools? Airports? Police? Fire? I think any extra tax revenue we might think we get is swallowed up pretty fast.

5743 2018-12-13 14:17:42 Now, FIIs who pulled their money out are going to chase this market--rocket fuel. Plus oil remains down, and easing by RBI will alleviate NBFC issues. Tight policy begets stress, which begets capital flight, which begets further tight policy. RBI was conducting terrible policy.

5813 2018-12-13 14:10:53 i’m annoyed cause i gotta get a Oil change & i just don’t feel like being responsible today 
5814 2018-12-13 14:10:40 I don't know why simply taking my car to get an oil change is enough to send me into an anxious mental breakdown, BUT IT SURE DANG DO.
5815 2018-12-13 14:10:39 Perhaps “freeze in the dark” can evolve into a contemporary phrase. Alberta can stop transfer payments until this is resolved. “Quebec can eat dirt until their opinion on dirty oil changes”.

5821 2018-12-13 14:10:19 Question I asked was if AB separated, do they assume Canada would allow AB to build pipelines to our tidewater without tariffs? Why would Canada buy AB oil when we the largest producer in the world next door with existing pipelines? Unless AB gives us a major price cut? 
5822 2018-12-13 14:10:19 Hi Ann - we only use sustainably-sourced palm oil in our products! For more information on this, please feel to drop us a DM where we can help further. Thank you!

5868 2018-12-13 14:06:22 This is every day in the life of those who trade anything oil related. When they’re the worst they stay that way a while. Up and  down price action aint the same animal
5869 2018-12-13 14:06:19 My sense is oil isn't going to pay the bills. We're going to pay oil's bills. And to top it off they proudly tell their shareholders that they have an ambitious, but not far fetched, goal to reduce employees to near 0.
5870 2018-12-13 14:06:12 Because partisans at the Fed have chosen to manipulate our economy and try to destroy our current President, by raising interest rates too high too fast !

5877 2018-12-13 14:05:28 Stuffing with cheese, olive oil, tomato.. is a great way to release moisture from within, then I like to sear the breast and finish it off on the oven wrapped in foil, also I always take it out a little bit before it is fully cooked and let it finish cooking on the counter top..

5894 2018-12-13 14:04:14 350 was formed by funding from Standard Oil as a tool to divest from fossil fuel and move billions into SRIs on Wall Street.  It’s not so much as a shift in consciousness as it is continuing their planetary resource grab and war on humanity under the guise of “green”.

5928 2018-12-13 14:01:45 The increase in oil production always begins at the gas pump. When the jalopy needs gas the markets react.

5941 2018-12-13 14:00:35 Also, Saddam had proved himself a poor manager of resources and wanted to raise the price of oil to fund the war with Iran, and also threatened to bomb Israel with chemical weapons - America’s biggest ally in the M. East. Which was probably the last straw for the US.

5943 2018-12-13 14:00:33 I was just wondering about something 
If olive oil is made from olive then 
Baby oil is made from..... 
5944 2018-12-13 14:00:26 I mean, at least auto shops might be open by the time this truck gets here to service my car. New battery if needed, oil change almost due anyways, give it the works cuz it’s pay day and I’m good for it, but an accurate arrival time would’ve been nice. 
5945 2018-12-13 14:00:21 TOTH: OIL 1H price action finally aligns with indicators, bullish short term.
NATGAS 1H secures 4.231=resist now supt, testing 50MA. I look for this area to be HOD.
USD 1H sustaining move above 50MA resist, volatility unwinding.
GOLD 1H BREAKS corellation with USD & holds.
5946 2018-12-13 14:00:21 I root for @tesla. It will bail us out of oil dependency.

5957 2018-12-13 13:59:20 Ur assumption that it will b used on it. If u won't less crude oil being proceed in2 fuel, then talk abt introducing measures 2 reduce the demand of fuel with alternative, reduce the need, means reducing the production. O&G don't produce fuel 4 the fun of it.
5958 2018-12-13 13:59:17  I'll pass on the smoke session, but as they subsidise farmers to grow weed like corn  I'd take Mitch's full non-gmo weed in oil form THC CBD CBN and all. It's just like taking green tea extract vs. drinking a hundred cups to get the same EGCG benefits. #Entourageeffect
5959 2018-12-13 13:59:04 He's trying to point out something on taxes generated through oil then and now, show that then we relyed more on petroleum, compare to now that we don't anymore and yet we r able to get up to the taxes generated then! If u know u know, we know 
5960 2018-12-13 13:58:56 So where’s the proof of this? Are our oil/gas sector important? Sure, but we’re not the heart beat of Canada’s economy

5962 2018-12-13 13:58:37 yep. like I grew up in a place where you couldn't sit in the pub booth under the tacky "oil" painting on Thursdays bc Big Leo found it awkward to ask people to move so he could make his pick-up from the safe behind there. in retrospect, Big Leo was comparatively subtle.

5966 2018-12-13 13:58:14 Apart from nukes, missiles, and Israel of course, there is the story of oil. And it always have been. Oil, natural gas, and a unique geopolitical landscape; caspian sea and russia from north, strait of Hormoz from south, giving access to 14 neighbouring countries
5967 2018-12-13 13:58:06 honestly we give my dog cbd oil cause he’s a lil psychopath and now he’s cuddling me in bed :’)

5974 2018-12-13 13:57:33 During the day drink lemon & ginger tea. Eat spicy Asian soups such as Tom Yum Soup & Luksa. Fluids will help flush your system, chili helps clear sinuses. When you sleep rub Tiger Balm on you chest & neck, sprinkle your pillow with eucalyptus oil to keep your sinuses clear.
5975 2018-12-13 13:57:33 Or you could fry the weed oil and use that
5976 2018-12-13 13:57:12 you understand that as demand for oil rises it will be produced by another country with worse standards?

5989 2018-12-13 13:55:43 No, countries had received waivers to purchase Iranian oil while sanctions against Iran were on. The US wasn't even holding this money. Do even the most cursory research and you'll see you're being lied to.
5990 2018-12-13 13:55:34 And another interesting fact is we are sitting on lots of oil and gas resources in this province that will never be developed. The geology in the St Lawrence River basin has been compared to other major oil and gas-rich zones

6029 2018-12-13 13:52:03 I hate to burst your bubble, but due to unnecessary government subsidies, oil companies actually pay NEGATIVE income tax, to the tube of billions of dollars of OUR tax money.  End those subsidies and we could fund a lot with that alone.

6209 2018-12-13 13:33:03 Im sure supporting GSA in high schools is a good cause but I hope he was there to thank Alberta for employing thousands of Newfoundlanders in the construction and oil Industry. People like myself depend on it, because we all can't work for the Public Service.

6238 2018-12-13 13:30:07 something is strange .Iran is telling their people since USA imposed sanctions their oil exports has increased. What a going on? Most taught the president was serious and really apply the sanctions. Other countries not complying? About wall , build gradually?2 + billions to start
6239 2018-12-13 13:29:57 People have no clue about where the US economy would be absent recent innovations in the oil and gas industry.  Oil companies should be heralded rather than demonized (and watching their competition get tax credits).

6321 2018-12-13 13:21:07 It creates a layer between the oil in the pan and the scrapple proper.  Like the batter on fried chicken.  It prevents burning, and it also takes on a flavor and texture of its own.

6351 2018-12-13 13:18:29 Yes- plastics is just one part of broader issue of addiction to consumption (US demand for consumer goods=29% of US CO2-e AND 25% of *China’s* CO2-e).

Plastic as example helps directly connect oil/gas to everyday consumption, helps us understand the system & how we fuel it.

6353 2018-12-13 13:18:23 First I would check all its oil and water. Then does it free wheel OK? After I would get the air filter and fuel filter changed. Then plugs after that. Airfilter is my first choice x
6354 2018-12-13 13:18:10 Or to scientists in general.

The consensus, in the literature, is that glyphosate isn’t carcinogenic. 

If big oil can’t buy climate scientists (a far smaller group) then it strikes me as weird that a company of Monsanto’s size can allegedly buy biologists and all world govts.

6356 2018-12-13 13:18:04 The secret is on the oil and the veges you add. Just visit gawa restaurants  opp GPO, next to equity bank hapo and order a plate with chapo, you'll regret slundering njahi .

6361 2018-12-13 13:17:26 Stop fracking and subsidising air travel and oil exploration now. Hosting another conference to gas about gas in 2 years is more energy and time wasted. You are in government to take action not host discussions.

OIL 15M struggles to move up. It went back above $50 a barrel and holds there. Signals "mixed" now. WATCH
6363 2018-12-13 13:17:22 I’ve never understood the reasoning for a pipeline East except to move oil offshore.  The one refinery in the east has stated that it does not want domestic oil.
6364 2018-12-13 13:17:19 Looking at the replies most people hate you @BP_plc apart from shareholders. Spending £M on advertising doesn't cut it, so be honest, admit to the damage you are doing, we all need oil, engage with consumers, tell your s/holders to forgo divi, do some environmental repair work.
6365 2018-12-13 13:17:18 Since @draxnews travels between often the USA and UK anyway (I know, burning oil, to burn wood) they could perhaps offer to take USA COP26 visitors in bulk on one of their pellet ships. The trip takes 19 days, so I'm sure a decent satellite internet link would also be nice.

6368 2018-12-13 13:17:03 I use coco butter and coco oil for my kids hair and skin. They love it and it smells so good and there pediatricians said it was all okay! They are my most go too if I want my skin soft tbh. I don’t see no problem with it.

6372 2018-12-13 13:16:29 45% of our oil comes from Alberta via the 9B pipeline. The same amount comes from  by train. 99% of the electricity from hydro and wind. In most of other provinces (except BC, Man., NL) comes from coal, gaz and nuclear

A better metric is required
6383 2018-12-13 13:15:25 You don't seem to get it,

6386 2018-12-13 13:15:16 Thanks for the reply. There is no quick fix to this problem. Other alternatives include: doing nothing; shutting down Line 5 immediately triggering a propane shortage in the UP; years of lawsuits at taxpayer expense; and oil barges or tank trucks. What solution do you support?

6419 2018-12-13 13:12:14 Once we shift our mindset from fear of loss to justified anger at having been collectively gaslit, we’ll choose to reject gas & oil.

Think #GrabYourWallet (#ForClimateSake): together, we gamify the process of weaning ourselves, routines, & habits off of oil/gas. Could be fun!

6425 2018-12-13 13:11:29 Okay, so we buy the crude oil at prices set by OPEC, then we have the money spent to send it by oil tanker, which takes more time and money than train, then pay the customs when it arrives, and then it gets refined into our useable fuel products. How is it more expensive?

6454 2018-12-13 13:08:52 Yes but Newfoundland has along way to go. They are hypocrites. They have billions of barrels of oil on the west coast and they also have a oil ban in place so they can’t develop it’s industry
6455 2018-12-13 13:08:41 We should be investigating using Newfoundland oil in the east.

6468 2018-12-13 13:07:28 Ok, if it better to use Canadian oil, then we should investigate using Newfoundland oil, cleaner than Alberta oil.  Pipeline can come from the east and we can use the refineries in NB.  Economically makes more sense.
6469 2018-12-13 13:07:22 The overwhelming number  of scientists believe in climate change unless they are paid by an energy company. That is also true of politicians. The biggest climate denier is James Inhoffe and he takes the most money from the oil and gas industry.

6495 2018-12-13 13:04:29 Sadly you are made to believe we are incapable of creating an economy that doesn't rely on oil. We have the best agricultural land in the region. We can survive and build our economy through agriculture. A minimum production of oil can be maintained but no more new permits.

Plastic straws earned scorn b/c sea turtle nostrils. But they’re made using gas/oil derivatives. Single use plastics=trash, but also, gas/oil. And, anything we buy new is made by a factory run on gas/oil.

6515 2018-12-13 13:02:42 Ok, so if the east uses Saudi Foreign oil, and you think we should use Canadian oil, then maybe we should investigate using Newfoundland oil.  Pipelines would go from the east to refineries in NB, not dirty bitumen. And everyone is happy.

6527 2018-12-13 13:01:48 The USA has no energy independence from the middle east without Canadian oil (40% of your daily supply). As for defending ourselves we do just fine. What is shitty is that people put party over count exactly what the GOP is doing.

6553 2018-12-13 12:58:33 Vinegar: water 50:50 might help. Also, perhaps it's the oil you use? Vegetable oils can turn rancid.
6554 2018-12-13 12:58:22 Perception is the crux of the issue. The oil industry does not do a good job selling itself, negative press such as pipeline spills don’t help matters. Expecting projects to get approved with little to no resistance will come back to bite eventually.
6555 2018-12-13 12:58:21 Two different conversations. Today, tomorrow and the next ten to twenty years then next twenty years plus. The Green Party needs to stop arguing with the current position and build a test project isolated from oil and gas products and their energy production.
6556 2018-12-13 12:58:13 TY. That's why I am trying to do, & take my time. Trying to get the right consistency to the paint is hard & what to mix it with. I started with linseed oil, but now I found this gel that dries a little better and doesn't have that shine. If anything, it's good therapy.

6572 2018-12-13 12:56:52 (1/2)My bigger problem with this (besides the suppository) is the suggested use of Lemon Essential Oil to “break up the toxins in your body and fat cells.”

6578 2018-12-13 12:56:10 Motive to understanding addiction is to grasp ‘control aspect’. Here in privileged CO2 polluterville Massachusetts few let go shale gas&oil on an individual level, as if gas&oil has control and not person.

Do you say this to all US Citizens unhappy with what is going on there? Like Underpaid Teachers, water problem in Flint, oil pipeline leaks, etc.?
Also, did you say this to those who hate Obama/Clinton/W Bush/etc. during their presidency too?
6588 2018-12-13 12:53:36 They want to continue making billions from oil etc. They don't give a monkey's about half the world dying off. They know they can invest in their own safety because they are billionaires.

6632 2018-12-13 12:47:11 Going to NNPC Apata Depot today was not successful, as i was sent back by the "security officer". Forgetting that my intention was to appraise the Research on Oil and Gas to help develop my project proposal for PTDF PhD sponsorship. Admin officer rescheduled my appointment.
6633 2018-12-13 12:47:10 This is good advice. When it's harder to get sunshine in the cold dark months, it's a good idea to supplement D, too. I recommend cod liver oil. 2 tsps/day. #WinningSecrets #SecretsOfPros

6639 2018-12-13 12:46:52 By that logic I suppose when you pay for gas at the pump,  the oil company isn't getting paid?  Use your brain !!

6641 2018-12-13 12:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?

6643 2018-12-13 12:46:25 I never oil my cutting board? I missed the memo.  But to remove bad odors I use a fresh lemon and bi carb and use the half a lemon like a scourer.

6645 2018-12-13 12:46:12 Interesting terminology such as "oil mirrors" and answer sketches including Christmas trees, ah it must be exam marking season #marking #exams #terminologymixups #goodstudents
6646 2018-12-13 12:46:11 Right?!? Body oil helps but nothing stops it.
6647 2018-12-13 12:46:06 こう考えると日本で昔流行ったゼネラリスト信仰は罪深い。

6648 2018-12-13 12:46:02 @nopsema can you get the fuck out of here with that oil drilling bullshit in the great Australian bite, stop ruining our country!
6649 2018-12-13 12:46:02 Very smart move by these countries that will not rely on oil as much in future but will own a bunch of xrp instead, kudos
6650 2018-12-13 12:45:57 The added on at the last minute restrictive regulations placed specifically and only on EE by Justin & his AB oil hating Gov't absolutely did kill this pipeline.
If the Libs were ever to play fairly these same regs would be put in place on foreign oil.

6657 2018-12-13 12:44:56 It tastes like geen but with healthy oil, like not salty and not sweet but both at the same time. It doesn't have much flavor to be honest. I think.

6682 2018-12-13 12:42:09 Because of its abundance, I'm inclined to see Maine's groundwater use as a public-private collaboration that is probably too light on the public side right now. I think the way Alaska regulates its oil industry is the best approach we'd ever get.
6683 2018-12-13 12:42:05 We highly recommend a gift that can lead you to becoming "Debt Free" USA! PS: I recently made an appt. to have an oil change & that's pretty much what I told the Dealer when they "tried" to fool me into buying a new vehicle! "No thanks, I'm Debt Free & I want to keep it that way"
6684 2018-12-13 12:42:04 It’s almost like the entire oil industry is a worthless dying fossil yet they  create more corruption than the Trump family on a weekend in Saudi Arabia
6685 2018-12-13 12:41:51 Money brings in money ... 

It is well known secret that the Corrupt @HillaryClinton family  has its fingers in the global oil deals
6686 2018-12-13 12:41:48 How long will it take the @warriors to realize that @Money23Green having a good game and being involved in the game plan generally results in a successful outcome? He is the oil that makes the Warrior Machine run and when he's not involved, they generally don't win.
6687 2018-12-13 12:41:43 I have no plateform but as a native NYer I screamed at the top of my lungs SNAKE OIL SALESMAN and here we are! He is exposed & all that he thinks he got away with has become due all at once. Mentally he can’t cope, physically nobody could.
6688 2018-12-13 12:41:36 It’s the palm oil used in their manufacturing that gives them that waxy flavor unfortunately

6719 2018-12-13 12:38:47 Mexico is often referred to as payment. This is not often the case in Mexico, Mexico, the Upanishan contract is very expensive and much better than the US oil covenant. There, and we have a small bang.
6720 2018-12-13 12:38:45 Burning the midnight oil tonight huh?
6721 2018-12-13 12:38:41 I don't know how often to Vicchel >: "one or other, is part of Mexico to push the walls." New Mexico (and Canada) is the best way to avoid oil USCÂ expensive age, remember the walls transporting Spanish support!

6736 2018-12-13 12:36:58 Coconut oil is comedogenic and it’s molecular makeup is too large to penetrate your skin and hair. It’s a topical barrier almost and it might make your hair/skin look or feel nice but it’s not actually being absorbed and also not actually moisturizing.

6757 2018-12-13 12:34:05 I kinda agree.  There are people that live without oil and natural gas - albeit in 3rd world conditions - but it is possible.  
But without water - people die.  Imagine that power as a private entity.  It seems morally corrupt.
6758 2018-12-13 12:34:00 Conservatives were in power for decades and were happy sending oil to Texas for refining. People in glass houses should never throw stones.

Did you know our Citizenship by Investment plan exists and jumped from $650k to $800k in recent.
6765 2018-12-13 12:33:16 There is a trend among some food producers Turkey in misleadingly labelling their products, which may not be surprising in #US but it is strictly regulated by #EU. Recent violations occur especially in an apparent attempt to hide palm oil usage or to encourage sugar consumption.

6771 2018-12-13 12:32:05 How would we be better off on our own? Does that make it easier to get oil to tide water?
6772 2018-12-13 12:32:05 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
6773 2018-12-13 12:32:03 so actually palm oil have the highest vit E okay. kenapa nak boycott 
6774 2018-12-13 12:31:54 No, they didn’t.

When they lose, 37% is a mandate. When they win, 48% have no say.

Ridiculous, self-serving snake oil salesman.

6788 2018-12-13 12:30:16 look into neem oil! I’ve been bc free going on 2 years & have been using neem oil, while also still taking precautions.. My best friend is who shared this with me. She had used it solely for 5 years before she decided to go on the pill.

6790 2018-12-13 12:30:07 The people using this diet have no fucking idea how much the industry of meat pollutes. Not even oil pollutes that much... I guess some stupid ass bodybuilders are eating this constantly and not caring about the future of our planet. It's the only one we have!! 
6791 2018-12-13 12:30:06 Nigeria's Agriculture sector was a neglected sector that is gradually gaining its position as a high income generating sector of the country.

In the past, oil has blinded the leaders from the bountiful opportunities that exists in the sector but thanks to recession.

6794 2018-12-13 12:29:51 We don't want to have nice things from other countries, like food, drink, oil, electricity, computers and televisions. We just want to revert to an agrarian lifestyle of subsistence serfdom. Why can't the metropolitan elite see that?

6801 2018-12-13 12:29:16 Most of the oil sector c-tax is levied by Alberta not the Feds. 
Most (>%90) of oil sector C emissions comes from combustion of the product not from its production or transportation. 
But don’t let facts get in the way of a good ol put down.
6802 2018-12-13 12:29:10 Completely agree with advertisement masculinity bias, but I really like their products.... although 90% of my skincare is advertised as "for women", their moisturiser and beard oil are

6806 2018-12-13 12:29:03 Awkward story: I got both of my grandsons in wrestling at 8 & 9 yrs old. I was an assistant coach. I waited till they were 12 to explain what checking the oil was. Their reaction was priceless. There's something wrong with Grandpa. 
6807 2018-12-13 12:29:03 Mišković, who is also serving as the vice-president of the Croatian FA, was a close associate to Volpi in Nigeria, where the Italian ran a transport business for oil companies. 

Mišković persuaded him to buy NK Rijeka, but once his accounts got under investigation, he sold it.
6808 2018-12-13 12:28:53 I think $20 oil is a "yellow swan" event. Impossible, that is.

6811 2018-12-13 12:28:33 Just a quick reminder that today's stream is going to be late.

Gotta take the car in for an oil change and run a couple errands I forgot from yesterday.

I *think* we'll be on at around 11am Eastern, just depends on how quick I can get stuff done.
6812 2018-12-13 12:28:10 Good news. Alternatively, try non-invasive treatment: cannabis oil.  Charlotte’s Web.

6822 2018-12-13 12:26:52 This is 2018.

It’s time to wake up and invest in new education to train ALL Canadians for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a new power sources. 

The “future prosperity” of all Canadians is NOT in Oil or Pipelines.

This is NOT sustainable growth to the economy.

6837 2018-12-13 12:25:24 Consensus? This is just my opinion based on reading the SARBs future assumptions. They assume steep interest rate hikes from the Fed and ECB, that oil will be higher than it is now and that the Rand stays at this level. All 3 scenarios will probably be better than the SARB assume

6848 2018-12-13 12:23:44 That was Iran's own proceeds from oil sales frozen in banks across the world. Not U.S. money. I thought Mexico was paying for the wall, not the hard working taxpayers at your rallies to whom you blatantly lied over and over again.
6849 2018-12-13 12:23:44 Alberta's government is cutting back on oil production, it will be no surprise coal mines will be next.
6850 2018-12-13 12:23:43 Alberta is basically paying for Saudi oil and gas from USA. So Quebec can play smart ass and «eco friendly» Get these French people of their white horses now!

6902 2018-12-13 12:17:32 Just a thought on top of the mind- OPEC oil price increase redistributes the wealth to Oil producing nation's who probably spend it lavishly. But low oil prices redistributes wealth to Emerging nation's where humanity benefits with Innovations.

#OPEC #oilprice #EconomicIndicator
6903 2018-12-13 12:17:31   and i am sure Oil receipt isnt spent in $. FAAC is shared in Naira., we can just convert Oil receipt to Naira and quote it, but that wouldnt serve the purpose, would it?

-Increased taxes on wealthy
-Increased fines on employers
-Cut tax breaks on large established industries (ie oil)
-Mexico pitch in substantially
Et al
6908 2018-12-13 12:17:06 1. SNP policy is farcical when advocating to remain in EU - Scotland too weak to reform CFP
2. Key word is undeveloped - cost of new wells here far exceeds that off eg. Brazil (tax, labour cost)
3. SNP pushing for green energy so hardly consistent to advocate new oil withdrawal!
6909 2018-12-13 12:17:03 Sorry but QB gvt seems to prefer tanker trucks on the highways and rail cars carrying oil.  Max, I firmly believe is the man to change their views.
6910 2018-12-13 12:16:46 Given the poor price action clearly some future expectations are being built into oil prices now.

6937 2018-12-13 12:12:43 Not at the rate its economy needs to get out of the whole. You have to realize that it relies heavily on tourism and they have a very aged populace so alot of changes have to be done to improve it. Even Saudia is walking away from oil dependency
6938 2018-12-13 12:12:27 2/2 specialism and effective competition are the opposites of resilience. They lock nations into a position where they cannot physically handle major transformations. Cold Sweden has no oil, no phosphorus, no independent agriculture.

6949 2018-12-13 12:10:55 I wonder why the president trump wants to dump the electric car programs, could it be that he’s counting on Saudi Arabia oil??? Don’t be fooled, that’s why trump went easy on the killing of the American reporter. Money over what morale. God bless America!!!

6958 2018-12-13 12:09:45 Lmaooo. Nothing is gender specific.
 I can cook and clean, I can turn on the gen and turn it off, even put fuel and oil. I can wash cars better than some car wash guys.
 The men in my family can do both.
 The point of this is basic self sufficiency..
6959 2018-12-13 12:09:16 Lol, I'm sure you have seen the Atiku Policy Document, so tell me how he's going to fund the unspecified roads without procedures with the current price of a barrel of crude oil in the world market? Let's hear

6991 2018-12-13 12:05:28 Now you see the attitude Albertans are facing! All millionaires, no sales tax, high wages? So how does that suck anyone else dry? You drive, heat your home, and use a multitude of oil based products. Should that make them be available to you for free? Develop your own resources!
6992 2018-12-13 12:05:06 @RepSwalwell is a snake oil salesman.  A partisan hack who sells lies to build his personal power.   Trump has stood up to world leaders and party leaders like no president since Reagan. Trump is working for America's interests, not his own.
6993 2018-12-13 12:05:01 Mark Fisher said the next 10 $ in oil is up but how do you trade that.
unless u use no leverage it seems complicated given the vol
6994 2018-12-13 12:04:57 Staying hydrated, and eating freely of fat should be enough. Adding coconut oil or MCT oil can be of benefit as well
6995 2018-12-13 12:04:53 Follow the money. Any senator from Alberta who votes in favour of C-69 is getting paid off by anti oil interests.

Do we see a theme? He's a Goldbug, Grover Cleveland Democrat.
6999 2018-12-13 12:04:01 Every country on the planet seems to be partially socialist. Our best buddies in the EU are socialist and on and on. We used to be great allies with Venezuela but then they had the nerve to take over there own oil interests and cut out the parasite middleman. War soon!

7031 2018-12-13 12:00:43 We absolutely do NOT need the Saudis for their oil. And the claim that by not supporting the Saudis we are giving open reign to Iran does not hold water either. OH YES, Let's remember Jhared Kushner and the PRINCE are BESTIES , WHY ? Future lucrative business opportunities in S.A
7032 2018-12-13 12:00:39 There are a lot of Canadians who don’t like Alberta’s oil industry but they don’t realize that it is supporting the federal government’s finances. 

Too many are misled into believing it’s inconsequential or easily replaced or would only be a short term hiccup if it were ended.

7052 2018-12-13 11:57:37 I sure hope they're looking at CDS spreads, sovereign, corporate and inflation expectations as we just had a 30% drop in oil which is over 40% of raw commodity size weighted input into producers & consumer costs when the ECB holds a press conference.
7053 2018-12-13 11:57:25 Does it really sound right to you that, those sending their kids abroad for education are only government official? What about the previous fake oil marketers and vague contractors of the past?

So why did the tax revenue from non-oil sectors DROP compared to 2012?

I gave the USD figures in a previous tweet above. I used USD in order to properly show the value difference between the figures from then and now.

7201 2018-12-13 11:39:58 I do that on the stove. My favorite is eggplant provolone. I infuse the olive oil with karmic by thin slicing the garlic and heating it in olive oil on los for about 10 minutes, brush the egg plant with that, cook one side on the stove, top with provolone, oregano, and pepper

7237 2018-12-13 11:35:52 A team of snake oil salesmen, that's what they will primarily be remembered for. Any positives that arose from their success is based on a lie.
7238 2018-12-13 11:35:32 Same people that share their promiscuous fornication stories on TL, share porn and other immoral stuffs on the TL, proud of sleeping around, and doing runs are the one's trying to be moral police on someone that made a choice to get married and start a life.
Hypocrisy stinks
7239 2018-12-13 11:35:29 You said Buhari borrowed highest and nw u say by which percentage? Nigeria's total debt is $73 billion. The last administration made over $480 billion in oil revenue alone. Met $53 billion in the foreign reserves and left $63 billion debts and $28 billion in our foreign reserves.

7274 2018-12-13 11:31:03 Two words. Oil Revenue. I think you'll find that's the underlying reason for the English-controlled Westminster to oppose Independence for Scotland. That and the fact that Scotland, Wales & NI are the only parts of their precious empire they really have left. PS I am English.

7278 2018-12-13 11:30:49 The predicament you're in was self-inflicted by mismanagement of oil resources and insisting on no PST, also mismanaged. When your low-bracket income is $125,000, it's pretty hard to attract sympathy
7279 2018-12-13 11:30:44 Apparently #DrainTheSwamp refers to the prehistoric ones full of oil?
7280 2018-12-13 11:30:42 I think Qatar is being extorted. We don't want the oil and gas discoveries that they share with Turkey and Iran to be developed. That is why they were sanctioned, the Iran nuclear deal ripped up, and the true problem with Turkey, and why no one wanted the Russian sanctions lifted

It relies on another fact: the earth is 4.5 B years old. Do you agree with those two facts? Or do you “feel” the earth is 6000 years old?
7284 2018-12-13 11:30:32 Yes stupidity going by government and by oil company if it's not stay by court possibility that NPA will surely increased from Petroleum dealers side ,that will huge loss to society & similarly oil company will west public money but govt can help oil company not to dealership.

7343 2018-12-13 11:20:34 All energy will be green in 30 years - where will you buy energy from that’s cheaper then or even now? We had cheap oil but we sold it for tax cuts in the 80’s & 90’s - why are the Chinese building our generating plants if it’s the EU - we contracted them not the EU?
7344 2018-12-13 11:20:31 Aberdeen economy largely dependant on North Sea Oil industry, can only surmise how this was prioritised. An increase in industrial traffic & population. Wonder what the volumes are really between Dundee and Fraserburgh/Elgin or was it more get vehicles out of the centre?
7345 2018-12-13 11:20:21 #Shanghai's #crude oil futures volumes (traded in #yuan) set to record trading #volumes for 2018, capturing market share, up to 6%, equally from established #Brent and #WTI benchmarks

7350 2018-12-13 11:19:18 Bad for you. Made from palm oil, there are other hazelnut spreads as good if not better out there. Made with coconut oil. Costco or other. 
Nutella is very environmentally unfriendly, using palm and destroying habitats to farm palms. 
I switched and family very happy also.
7351 2018-12-13 11:19:17 BC sells out Alberta because they had an American pipeline deal ready to go (pretty obvious, also LG is not going to want Alberta oil to get to international markets.  Environmental concerns.  Not a chance

7363 2018-12-13 11:16:55 How does tight oil quality vary around the world? To the extent we can get heavier crude to market from other tight oil, would that not be a rational next step for this market?

7365 2018-12-13 11:16:50 I do not agree sir.
This is like giving an excuse for armed robbery because of poverty.
Again, most of the people scooping the vegetable oil aren't doing so for consumption, its mostly for resale which is to leverage financially
7366 2018-12-13 11:16:38 I'm also intrigued by the concept of "hand-cooked crisps". Were thin slices of potato held individually in the very hot oil by burning hands I wonder?  :-)  #marketingnonsense

7391 2018-12-13 11:12:50 Turkish occupation is @NATO occupation, US is squeezing the Kurds, by using TA, to its ends, it seems they want Turkey to occupy Kurdish populated regions and Kurds to occupy oil rich Arab populated areas

7450 2018-12-13 11:03:34 Well, 1st off, oil prices are low due to fracking-huge amounts of oil being introduced to the market from US/Canadian sources.  2nd, US troops on UK soil-called a deterrent.  And 3rd, # of UK troops that deployed was not much of a help...trust me, I was there.

7452 2018-12-13 11:03:19 I find renewable energy fantastic, the problem is that -at least for now- solar and wind power are not affordable in respect to the power provided. If confronted with cheap and reliable fossil fuel and oil energy, renewables are not a good solution to fullfill our need of energy.
7453 2018-12-13 11:03:04 I suppose markets was the wrong term. I know most places I've worked that used fosil fuels, there were capabilities to use various types - coal, bunker C oil, natural gas, etc to generate energy. I believe as natural gas cost decreases, companies will move from coal.

Iran/Saudi are a dominance power-play ... with Shia/Sunni undertones. Iran has a democracy. Saudi doesn't. It's the US that seeks regime change. Oil, ports, refineries.
7606 2018-12-13 10:38:56 I am also bullish on WTI for H1 but one needs to agree that unless US oil shale production stops growing this has very little if any upside.
7607 2018-12-13 10:38:47 Told you I don't like arguing or having combo about religion. But forced marriage in Islam is wrong. If you're even getting your daughter married off you've to look at the background of the spouse.That man is known as a serial divorcee, he impregnates these girls and divorce them

7616 2018-12-13 10:37:17 It’s only temporary, wrap up warm!  I’m grateful for those tough early years shaping my early career in oil & gas. It was an excellent training ground for me despite its decline and those  folks nurtured my early learning in the industry  #gratitude
7617 2018-12-13 10:37:05 ใช่แล้วว
7618 2018-12-13 10:36:22 I’m so glad we have oil independence.
7619 2018-12-13 10:36:21 Thank God. I don’t even get worried with them, they are completely blind.
7620 2018-12-13 10:36:15 I'm upset with @IcelandFoods  because I was taken in by their emotive ad about orangutans and palm oil. I thought they cared about animals. I drove out of my way to shop there. I RT their ad numerous times. Then I discovered they sell eggs from caged hens.  Incongruous.
7621 2018-12-13 10:36:06 Nigeria in 2016 had 70 something million poor people and India had 76 million poor people. Within three years India pulled 102 million people out of poverty. They have no oil. Your country pulled 12 million into poverty - Peter Obi

7643 2018-12-13 10:33:41 I think we should be able to say which is broadly the least worse conventional power: coal/gas/oil/nuclear. It engages more people than just saying renewable or nothing! Clearly more renewable is good.

7645 2018-12-13 10:33:04 US and global economy can expand only with crude oil steady at $10-20 per barrel.

7648 2018-12-13 10:32:43 People who work in the oil industry know about these fields so they are only hushed up by those in Parliament who have an agenda. News is, that oil is running out one day and in abundance a week later, according to what is going on in the political world.

7663 2018-12-13 10:30:58 Typical SAGD Steam Oil Ratios are about 2.5; it takes about 500 scf to boil a barrel of water and let's say Henry Hub gas is $3/mscf. So it costs 3 x 2.5 x 0.5 = $3.75/bbl to raise steam... Now that compares to c. $15-20/bbl rail car transport costs.

What hurts SAGD is location

7674 2018-12-13 10:29:29 Let’s see, We’re not fond of Iran which is Shi’a. It looks like we’re backing Saudi which is Sunni. That’s 2 Sunnis. It’s the luck of the draw. The OIL was the big deciding factor. Tell me Kashif, what is your take. Skip Syria. It’s a mess. We don’t like Bashir.
7675 2018-12-13 10:29:29 They work better julienned in soups. Frying them lightly in oil leaves them flexible and they aren't dried. I suppose spraying them lightly with oil b4 the light toasting in the oven would work.

N/$ = 160
N5 Trillion = $31.3 Billion
Oil taxes = 64% = $20 B
Non-oil taxes = 36% = $11.3 B

2018
N/$ = 360
N5 Trillion = $13.9 Billion
Oil taxes = 47% = $6.5 B
Non-oil taxes = 53% = $7.4 B

$31.3 B vs $13.9 B: you see, in REAL terms, FY 2012 is still ~2.5 times > H1 2018.

7789 2018-12-13 10:15:07 The category is very large companies that can control their niche by monopoly or oligarchy. Also no, that's not how it works. Many oil companies provide a service, which theoretically could be competed against but in practice requires too much infrastructure.

7902 2018-12-13 09:58:55 I tried cbd oil and it helped. I got scared cos of the driving laws in case I built up to the limit though. :(

7907 2018-12-13 09:57:32 It’s backed by barrels of oil that haven’t even began to be produced.
7908 2018-12-13 09:57:29 Ladies on this thread, it's not about if you can change oil, buy fuel or carry crates of drinks, it's about when there's this kind of jobs(fixing gen, buying fuel etc) who gets called upon first boys or girls? 
When you answer that truthfully, then you get the gist.

7913 2018-12-13 09:56:17 And 1 more thing you might want to consider (and go ahead and research it).  The USA is throwing money at BC’s anti pipeline stance because it benefits them greatly that Canada doesn’t get their Oil directly to Asian markets
7914 2018-12-13 09:56:08 I’m going to guess, but I think they would need more crew, and so ships (owners) would rather just burn more oil, given it isn’t taxed so and is cheap, despite being the dirtiest oil...
7915 2018-12-13 09:56:05 I’ll soak up all the oil in the ocean of yr heart

7935 2018-12-13 09:52:26 It is somewhat surprising the poor price action in oil. People must really be counting on US shale expanding production in 2019 as there were all kinds of bullish news week (specially the outage in Libya - That alone is nearly 400k bpd).

If oil is confirmed from R1/2 zone I will expect this to be north of 11p and will be out of there as I can’t afford to take further risks for the next zone.

8168 2018-12-13 09:13:58 The timing was just right in 2014. It was set deliberately far off to have as much build up as possible and get the SNP economic fairy tale believed.

8320 2018-12-13 08:52:35 How is a 15 year old capable of loving someone as old as her grandfather? Issues of relationship should not even cross her path, let alone marriage. That girl should be in school, studying and not gratifying the absurd urge of an old pervert. This is abuse and you defend it.
8321 2018-12-13 08:52:30 IT IS TIME TO OIL UP!!!!

8326 2018-12-13 08:51:17 In the 1970s & 80s, the companies causing the most warming did their own studies into what was happening. In 1982 global oil giant Exxon predicted future warming perhaps incredibly, those 36 year old predictions are in line with what's seen today. @MikeySlezak #abc730 #auspol

8333 2018-12-13 08:50:21 The Saudi oil deal and the MCA are governed by two different checks and balances. The MCA is very keen on accountability. Saudi’s not so much. I think the PF government got its Fuel in $250 million worth of soft loans they took from Saudi to build the hospitals and import support

8338 2018-12-13 08:50:00 Because it's the PM's job to be concerned with all parts of Canada. No matter how much concern he feels, though, he can't dictate the global price of oil and make the global supply glut disappear.

Slowly, I poured jasmine oil down my girl friend's back. I felt her muscles yield to my touch. Eventually,  I  got her to relax and lightly fall asleep. Good thing she felt pleasure as my axe chopped through her neck making her blood squirt everywhere!
8340 2018-12-13 08:49:56 You can save money by doing your own oil change. I did, once. It was dirty, uncomfortable and above all, time consuming. You need to value your own time.

8343 2018-12-13 08:49:03 Now Trump and his supporters are claiming thay America isn't dependent on foreign oil which isn't true at all and half of our domestic oil is expensive, dirty shale oil which doesn't give much profit compared to oil fields in Russia and KSA.

8355 2018-12-13 08:46:54 My mistake, I meant oil burner. It was cheap nasty stuff from the $2 shop ne our office. Everyone thought it was the smells that bothered me (did a bit), but it was the health risks of breathing the shit in all day.

8357 2018-12-13 08:46:33 Totally. We need to start thinking clean energy. Too much dependence on oil has caused us more damage than good.

8452 2018-12-13 08:28:09 With some amendments this is the Pipeline bill that will build pipelines to tidewater that Conservatives cold not do. Pity for Alberta and Oil industry if they elect United Conservatives instead of Ms. Ms.Notley. UCP cannot even communicate with the Feds and rest of Canada.

8457 2018-12-13 08:27:04 Too bad you can’t see the financial impact it will have, just like ppl who voted for brexit. Alberta oil takes too much to process and is not economically sensible when you can get it from lots of other places. AB doesn’t have a monopoly

8459 2018-12-13 08:26:37 We going to run an economy on oil are we?

8468 2018-12-13 08:24:19 You seem to think the EU is the land of milk and honey. We'd still be net contributors, but without large subsidies from the UK or substantial oil revenues with prices < $100 a barrel.
8469 2018-12-13 08:24:16 listen i’m not gonna fight but we keep our olive oil to the left of the stove..it’s just easy access

8472 2018-12-13 08:23:31 She's talking about nationalizing the oil industry. That's not calling for a carbon-copy re-boot of a past implemented and failed socialist system. There are plenty of democratic countries in the world who have had nationalized major industries, like oil, for many, many, years.

8477 2018-12-13 08:22:38 They are looking for oil, can't think of a situation they helped any country, they even sort of created IS. I don't think they are allowed to invade other countries. imagine Egypt invading US to tryna save US problems.. and before doing this they should stop muslim discrimination

8479 2018-12-13 08:22:17 So for the first time I took my truck to get a oil change rather then doing it myself the day I left for Arizona. Leaving tonight and heading back home I pop my hood just to check my fluids and see I have no oil cap. I drove 15 hrs with no oil cap. @Valvoline I’m not happy.
8480 2018-12-13 08:22:05 Aye, right! It was Alex Salmond! The rallying cry of the FM and SNP leader himself! How did 62% of us respond? "Nah". And that was the 7th centenary of Bannockburn, when oil was over $100 pb, and we'd just staged the great Glasgow Commonwealth Games. The people won, you lost.

8487 2018-12-13 08:20:56 The Russian market shows mixed dynamics. The indices of the Moscow and the RTS slightly subside. This is happening against the backdrop of the oil market. Like OPEC agreed and made a deal to reduce production. And in spite of this, energy carriers could not rise significantly.

8525 2018-12-13 08:14:55 I may be overreacting but I am starting to think we need another big leg down in WTI to get US shale to halt production increases. The price action is beyond being bad. Today equities are rebounding and again oil cannot hang on.

8539 2018-12-13 08:11:06 No matter how we hate excise taxes on oil, there remains a purpose aside from revenues. And that is to compel us to move away from dependency from petroleum by using renewable energy. Unfortunately, that is where we lack sorely in terms of govt policy.

The incredibly expensive oil was indicative of the gratitude for what she had been forgiven, and acknowledgement of Christ's high station.

The Church is "the bride of Christ", she was doing it for the Church.

8587 2018-12-13 08:02:55 There is nothing outside of the EU that is going to make life better unless you have a lot of money - a weak £ will make food electricity oil and gas more expensive so we will just become a sweatshop for the rich.

8601 2018-12-13 08:01:36 Saudi Arabia only sells its oil for USD because of what King Faisal did in 1974

Oh come on now, even if I come to Riyadh and offer to buy Saudi oil with Dinar & Dirham (money in the Quran) the Saudis will not sell ? 

Saudi Arabia has violated the Sharia.

8666 2018-12-13 07:48:05 It's not. The shah eventually took control of oil industry and even raised the price of oil against the interest of the west. Basically the reason the US "helped" with the coup was because they didn't want communists to take control in Iran. Which is what would've happened.
8667 2018-12-13 07:48:04 Of course it was for oil and nothing but keep the people you wan tin power to keep oil prices low .

8699 2018-12-13 07:42:24 There is no ‘may’ about it.
Bear in mind that Wales is going fossil free. The profiteers investing in wind farm technology once invested in oil fields and fracking sites - now they’re wolves in sheep’s clothing, dressed up as ‘environmentally and socially conscious’.
8700 2018-12-13 07:42:23 Agreed, although certain aspects of what they said did concern me. Holding nonetheless.
8701 2018-12-13 07:42:21 A lot of westerners know about the coup and all that but they don't know about the bigger picture. They say the Mossadegh's government was democratic and CIA staged the coup because they are against democracy or they wanted cheap oil. Both arguments are nonsense and untrue.

8717 2018-12-13 07:38:04 Plus as far as i know now,planting and harvesting coconut is more profitable than palm oil,,we imported tonnes of coconut from outside. The demand is high in european countries and us too. (correct me if im wrong)

8719 2018-12-13 07:37:50 They are. They've only used Scottish PAYE tax income because thats all they can reliably track and made a guess at the oil income because you can't reliably track the big oil companies input into the system then sprinkled on some reliance on yoons-buttoned-up-the-backery, done 
8720 2018-12-13 07:37:45 When I had a proper job (oil industry) we’d do this when setting up a local supply chain  for the newly created village. A bit Heath Robinson but you’d be amazed what you do with corrugated sheets, pipe and engineering!
8721 2018-12-13 07:37:43 And how can the KL3 and KL4 be one pool of oil if they are not connected via the fractured shale ...and that comes from your glorious UKOG Leader SS?!! You’d better have words with him issuing naughty RNS’s  Looooong sigh

8727 2018-12-13 07:36:40 You wouldn't know they have the largest oil reserves in the world. It takes inspired stupidity to destroy that kind of an economy.
8728 2018-12-13 07:36:37 I hate nationalism in all its forms, I've worked with boys from all over the globe and we are all the same, no better no worse.

The EU will make it easy for us just to piss England off

8752 2018-12-13 07:32:56 | @MBuhari would've done better by Nigerians because it only seems he came to governance by accident meanwhile he contested 3 times and lost. And why are you/we still hung up on oil price to fuel our economy?! Critical thinking excludes excuses. #NoExcuses

8764 2018-12-13 07:29:50 In Australia we pay on average $6.62 p/gallon & have done for over 3 years now. It's even more in country areas. You've always had cheap oil. Think yourselves lucky.
8765 2018-12-13 07:29:47 On the @UKLabour website:  “The next Labour government will take radical action to safeguard the UK ... committing the UK to zero net emissions by 2050, ...” . Radical, note. Yet the also say they will support the oil and gas industry.

One of those things isn’t true.
8766 2018-12-13 07:29:45 He won't accept facts, but thank you for trying 

Also, he does not comprehend not keeping what does not belong to him

"We should have taken all of Iraq's oil"
8767 2018-12-13 07:29:41 EXACTLY. They're only using the PAYE figures for Scotland, and tax from oil production that they actually managed to scrape out of that accountant rich system.

8771 2018-12-13 07:28:47 My grandad was very ill in hospital, so the doctors covered him in lard and olive oil. But after that he went down hill very quickly.
8772 2018-12-13 07:28:32 Meanwhile, Canadian products especially commodities can be denied to China if tensions got escalated. How about keep selling oil by $15 per barrel in the next decade? And potash, Canola oil, LNG, international students, tourists, etc. etc.
8773 2018-12-13 07:28:25 yes destroying capitalism is first on my list of priorities lol but it’s so hard to find sustainable palm oil I honestly just avoid it entirely :/ no company big enough to be sold in Safeway has ethics anymore and I can’t really afford to shop anywhere else :(
8774 2018-12-13 07:28:17 Either we want to get back to work or we want a warm cup of milk. We need to pick one. My sense is oil is gonna pay the bills.

8776 2018-12-13 07:27:50 Missus has been bugging me to pick up some eucalyptus oil if you wanna do me a solid.

Actually, can I trust a stoner koala with this task 
8777 2018-12-13 07:27:44 we can never truly ban palm oil but we can make it sustainable. to educate people on this is to show how the industry can be clean & green. sustainability isnt just for planet, it’s also profit & people. human rights as well as economic balance.
8778 2018-12-13 07:27:43 In your infinite wisdom you know it's not true , she is cuppy , daughter of oil magnate femi ote$ . She has all the support she needs for a blooming musical career

8784 2018-12-13 07:27:24 It's also devastating to many species for whom he cares nothing. His own son cuts the tails off of elephants and kills leopards for fun.  Why would he give a damn about other lives, however rare or precious? He's blasting whales with seismic explosions to find more oil right now.

8788 2018-12-13 07:26:41 palm oil is actually the most sustainable oil! it has the highest yield per crop but because of capitalism companies grow and harvest it unsustainably for more profit :/ what we should really be doing is supporting sustainable palm oil! (and destroying capitalism)
8789 2018-12-13 07:26:18 اكيد ماما 
8790 2018-12-13 07:26:17 If the citizen has the conscience to educate themselves about how oil palm plantation & palm oil processing works, it might be easier. Plus, you talk about the wildlife, but dont forget about the millions of people who's live depending on the palm oil business.

8792 2018-12-13 07:25:56 that’s great! but we need more of this! loving the progress. so far only 20% have registered under MSPO. i’d like to see more environmental transparency as well as handling human rights crisis related to palm oil like the children in rural areas doing palm oil work or unsafe gear
8793 2018-12-13 07:25:48 I use coconut oil and then at night I would apply tissue oil... it will also help with your skin not getting darker from the friction

8795 2018-12-13 07:25:36 But your skin looks so great! I just use lotion and an oil serum after washing. I feel like the more people touch their face with product(s), the more sensitive it gets.
8796 2018-12-13 07:25:15 Imagine how powerful we’d be if we stopped eating animal products AND palm oil  that’s the world I wanna live in but probably never will.

8799 2018-12-13 07:24:15 Instead we get the take the real estate kick backs decision, teams in areas that hardly "expand" the game. Will there be any more oil mobs stepping in when the property developers cut and run?

8807 2018-12-13 07:23:19 Actually, countries pick favorites. That’s how you arrange importing food, oil, etc. If your policies tend towards dismembering journalists while alive, or invading countries because you want to, others will choose to work with those that align with their practices. Do you read?

8809 2018-12-13 07:22:18 Exactly. Texas government is a wholly owned subsidiary of oil & gas industries. Texas good ol’ boys let corporations do whatever they want. Just ask the residents of the town of West. A fertilizer plant blew up the town, killed first responders & residents living nearby.

8815 2018-12-13 07:21:24 Without Alberta’s wealth and foreign-exchange earnings, the living standard  would drop, the dollar would plummet leading to inflation as import costs rise.

8817 2018-12-13 07:21:10 Some pundits state that for Alberta to separate would not help us get our oil to world markets, but that isn't going to happen anyway. And think of the pros, no longer paying into the equalization agreement, no longer directing federal income tax to Ottawa.

Use gel like formulations

9002 2018-12-13 06:46:26 Dirty oil is soooo sneaky, I guess nobody told kindermorgan there’s a new plan?!
9003 2018-12-13 06:46:25 baby oil
9004 2018-12-13 06:46:24 Looks just like oil leaking out.... not very inviting
9005 2018-12-13 06:46:22 อ่ะ ใจเอนเอียงไป food science ฬ แล้วนะ
9006 2018-12-13 06:46:03 Check your Engine oil today.
9007 2018-12-13 06:45:58 How would you ship oil if you separated ? It would further Piss off BC.  Would really like Canada to work on a national strategy to supply our own oil rather than the trans mountain (which I'm not opposed of either btw)
9008 2018-12-13 06:45:56 Man’s world, unfortunately!
9009 2018-12-13 06:45:28 Jergens and baby oil gel is the best combination for the winter it leaves you soft, moisturize and smelling good
9010 2018-12-13 06:45:26 Need to put on some oil  skin dry
9011 2018-12-13 06:45:21 Advice? Sure. Get a really good set of high speed drill bits for metal, always use cutting oil and never let anybody else put their grimey dick beaters on them. The rest will work itself out.
9012 2018-12-13 06:45:15 Gots to get an oil change tomorrow. That’s gotta happen!

9016 2018-12-13 06:45:04 Switch from bar to liquid soap that doesn?t lather. Instead of stripping your skin with foamy cleansers, nourish your skin while you cleanse for a healthy clean glow. You can use oils such as argan and almond oil to cleanse the skin. #Oils #Wellness
9017 2018-12-13 06:45:01 Someone said something in the background that was what it would be like if Corbyn got into power, “Venezuela without the oil”. 
Venezuela, great socialist country led by one of Corbyn and his cronies hero’s, where the majority of the country is starving and there is a mass exodus
9018 2018-12-13 06:44:50 Asia Pacific Oil #Stocks Remain Subdued.
#Oil Prices fail to post a sustainable rebound, though #OPEC and #Russia agree to cut output. And oil stocks are further weighed down by recent stock #market weakness.

9028 2018-12-13 06:42:13 Whenever I see a FB ad, I think of those oil companies after their latest oil spill destroys an entire ecosystem when they air a commercial showing beautiful nature scenes with cute bunnies hopping in fields with Bambi.
9029 2018-12-13 06:41:46 This is an inconvenient truth the wackaloon faction. The ones who hold up signs saying, "Who needs oil, I ride the bus"

9042 2018-12-13 06:40:19 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9044 2018-12-13 06:40:06 True.  But the trans mountain pipeline won't relieve us of the Russians or Saudis oil.  It's only to ship out
9045 2018-12-13 06:40:04 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.

9050 2018-12-13 06:39:25 Ambani need not know the nitty gritty of an oil refinery. But he'll definitely required to know how to make profit from an oil refinery. Being a businessman and heading a  reputed institution is not the same.

9052 2018-12-13 06:39:13 You really don’t have to unless you have a turbo or a supercharged car. That way the oil for boosted cars warms up if its N/A you really don’t have to.

9057 2018-12-13 06:38:07 Just like you shouldn’t clean your cast iron, fry pans, or woks, you should reuse fry oil and let it darken a bit. You can add new oil to the mix but it’s that once fried oil that gives it that greasy flavor and crunch you want in a French fry.

9077 2018-12-13 06:35:26 I don't think Trump is lying or playing to his base.  He genuinely believes that we should have kept the Iranian money just as he said we should have taken the oil in Iraq.  Facts and laws mean nothing to him.  He won't listen.  Money is Trump's God and he wants it all.

9090 2018-12-13 06:33:56 @CTVKathyLe ... famous AB phrases'let the eastern bastards freeze to death' 'it is OUR OIL keep UR hands off' sure ameliorated REST of CANADA how AB take ownership of the plight their in instead blaming PQ ON BC Maritimes......
9091 2018-12-13 06:33:13 the seal popped out of my oil diffuser and it’s too big for me to put back in and it’s making me really mad trying to get it back in and I might actually not sleep at all tonight without lavender being diffused ..... sos sos sos
9092 2018-12-13 06:33:07 Upon further consideration, I’ve decided that I will NOT buy a new vehicle but rather I’m going to pay off my current gas vehicle and save up for a @Tesla. I really think the oil industry is unsustainable and we have to start actively looking for new sources of clean energy 
9093 2018-12-13 06:33:05 the power elite is coming to steal my worm schematics - the proliferation of free annelid-based power will bring an end to their empire of coal and oil; they simply cannot risk it
9094 2018-12-13 06:32:54 Yes, I also support pipelines. I also think we should be refining our own oil and not sending it to the US. I feel sorry for what Albertans are enduring right now because of Trudeau.
9095 2018-12-13 06:32:49 We do almost as much to destroy our only planet and kill all life on it (INCLUDING OURSELVES!) by spilling oil as we do by burning it!
9096 2018-12-13 06:32:48 I have read that even if CCS were cost-effective (it is not, except for enhanced oil recovery), it is constrained by the amount of available reservoir capacity underground. For example, were we to start today, all available reservoirs would be full in 20 years. Is this true?

9115 2018-12-13 06:30:14 simply don't have the time but they do.  Oil is 'bought' & exchanged for 'favours' ie contracts often weapons with leaders we put in place. Outcome being innocent 'Muslims' killed far outweighs innocent 'Christians' killed

9125 2018-12-13 06:28:12 Thanks Scott, apprecite the link.  I had a feeling they were funded by Oil & Gas, wasn't hard to guess.  I do support transitioning those industries, capital & jobs.  Won't be easy, will be worth it for our children's future.

9127 2018-12-13 06:27:43 You are living the dream nomi, sending cool thoughts. (Also hot tip they make cooling CBD oil, which by some witchcraft relieves both muscle and woundy ouches)
9128 2018-12-13 06:27:16 Add a oil of your choice to it. They can be a bit drying so it helps
9129 2018-12-13 06:27:05 I agree that Victoria sewage is not an issue due to the specific location and size of the tide. This all started because BC was spreading lies about Alberta's oil industry. It is very unfortunate that so much bad blood exists between BC and Alberta. We should be partners.
9130 2018-12-13 06:26:55 California barely has an oil industry, AFAIK, it's depressing that it had so much influence.
9131 2018-12-13 06:26:49 Don't send them money, please!!! My cousin had to pay for his travel to Chicago for an interview to IBM.. but they obviously have him the money back! IBM is a real company! Helifax Oil& Gas is not a real company! They have my money now.. and I will not manage to get them back!!!
9132 2018-12-13 06:26:07 WHY do you need a union .Can't you talk to your 
supervisor on your own without a union .Here in Texas there are very few unions  and people  make good money . There are a lot of very  good  paying oil field jobs here in Texas.

9133 2018-12-13 06:26:00 I disagree. It works well for my hair and I’m also 4b/4c. I also use Manes choice or Asiam But they’re more on the expensive side. Try a Mayo/Avocado mask or Castor oil.

9135 2018-12-13 06:25:47 Every time the oil price goes down, or it's an election year AB starts blaming QC & BC for all their problems and try to divide Canada.

Trudeau bailed you out $4.5 billion + $3.3 billion for new infrastructure, it's never enough, apparently.

9139 2018-12-13 06:24:50 We have our own oil.  I do agree however.  I wish the US would stay out of that entire region, and not sell weapons to questionable dictatorships, like the Saudis.

9145 2018-12-13 06:23:34 I always rub coconut oil on my belly when I get out of the shower, and I was looking at my belly, well matt woke up and came in the bathroom and says “you’re so beautiful, and you’re going to be even more beautiful when you’re 9 months pregnant and begging for Aviree to be out.
9146 2018-12-13 06:23:06 You made me glad with Your awesome deeds, Lord, How great are your works, Lord! You've grown my strength like the horn of a wild ox; I was anointed with fresh oil.

9148 2018-12-13 06:22:37 You do realize that west Texas was a desert before oil and will be after oil.
9149 2018-12-13 06:22:30 Mind yo own goddamn business . I feels just fine , just had to eat. Now get me some more bubbling oil and put it in this tub .
9150 2018-12-13 06:22:05 Olive oil!
9151 2018-12-13 06:21:53 If you can then you should try diluted tea tree oil! You can do like 2-3 drops in a glass of water and swish it in your mouth, I wouldn’t really put it directly on your teeth or gums cause it’s strong.
9152 2018-12-13 06:21:48 It would appear someone else with a massive head hasn't realized AB has been giving its oil away for free/next-to-free for some time and Canada has been doing just fine.

We're aiming to be off oil by 2030 anyway, so the "transfer payment" (false argument) gets weaker by the day.
9153 2018-12-13 06:21:34 Can someone educate me on CBD oil pls because I think I want to give it a shot but I don’t know very much about it
9154 2018-12-13 06:21:23 solar is just another 'product' to cashin in on....with powerful, "we're all gunna die" sales/fear hard sell, along with it....so a way of greatly increasing profits....oil (not stoppin) & solar (save the world)....marketing lies
9155 2018-12-13 06:21:22 Sir
Modi wud hav been just another politician, 2002 & media bashing made him 'Hindu hriday samrat' that's y he got 90% seats in UP & Bihar in 2014 not his 'Gujarat model' snake oil. Ther r more UPites in maha, can sharad powar win 90% seats in north with 'Maha Model'?
9156 2018-12-13 06:21:20  Coconut oil business in kerala!
9157 2018-12-13 06:21:00 this would be just a bonus, as more solar panel sales would be, to achieve the same power output.....all the oil corporations have huge investments in solar etc...so along with their main cashin 'oil', (which looks like continuing unabated)
9158 2018-12-13 06:20:36 That does not make any sense. Petroleum Engineers are  not involved in climate modelling. Many make decisions on biomarker evaluations/ vitrinite reflectance  that determine how hot rock the got. Some know about enhanced oil recovery or flow dynamics. Economics No
9159 2018-12-13 06:20:17 A stone-faced Mark Sanford explains to President Trump that oil executives are conservative Christians. A man in a yellow cloak serenades White House guests.

9171 2018-12-13 06:17:32 Trump should be talking about how he threatened stiff sanctions on Iran which in turn drove other oil producers production up and thus lowered prices. Trump didn't follow through with the sanctions...

9174 2018-12-13 06:16:35 The US senate has finally realized that Saudi has been bombing inocent Yemeni civilians and they shouldn't get away with the Khashoggi murder. Just after oil cuts were approved by Riyadh. Amazing
9175 2018-12-13 06:16:34 Then why is the US there bombing and supplying terrorists???? ISIS is a direct consequence of the US and the greed to control oil.
9176 2018-12-13 06:16:14 Keeping him on a significant amount of digestive aids, probiotics, and oil also made a big difference in how frequent/obsessive he was about it, he has hind gut ulcer flare ups frequently which seems to be a trigger.

9246 2018-12-13 06:03:54 Good. Canadians elected someone who isn't owned by albertas oil company to do things like this. Stop fear mongering and report facts, we don't need your useless old dated opinions.
9247 2018-12-13 06:03:44 I love it. Klentak holds up McCutchen as "I really tried hard." No starting pitching and no 10-year contract for the Big Two. 

Captain Coconut Oil is still the manager, so he might try McCutchen at second base or catcher before the All-Star break.

9249 2018-12-13 06:03:32 The West has ignored what China does to Tibetans and Mongolians just so they can have access to the Chinese markets and cheap Chinese labor.

China is making plans with Iran, right now, for a guaranteed oil supply.

China no longer needs to bow does to the West.

9251 2018-12-13 06:02:43 That's only in a few countries still, right? I know in America they stopped the tallow, and India and a few other countries they switched to full vegetable oil, but I think it's just commonwealth countries and couple others that still do the tallow?

9263 2018-12-13 05:59:58 Yep air quality with burning coal sucks too, still an issue in the world today; one good thing the Ontario Liberals did was to phase that out. Your point doesn’t address that oil and gas continue to add to the issues of GhG’s and overconsumption.

9275 2018-12-13 05:58:22 I don't want to say anything about this issue. There is no need convincing people that won't listen to what you are saying. For them, it is ok if the girl is into fornication than get married early.
Hypocrites everywhere.
9276 2018-12-13 05:58:12 Oil will continue to be produced in Alberta for maybe 50 years or more, but not in the same quantity in 10-12 years. And it will be upgraded here since it fetches a better price. 

But if you think we can produce unrestrained forever, then you are right, that’s done & gone.

9287 2018-12-13 05:56:33 what does tackling production mean? Cutting oil supplies? Would that not have an implicit tax of increasing price?

9302 2018-12-13 05:54:23 We've been asking for this for decades though and Alberta consistently under performs here.

From heritage fund to basically insisting that it's oil or bust. E.G. I have gotten shit working for a tech company that gets initiatives from Alberta because it should have gone to oil.
9303 2018-12-13 05:54:13 Too high when you consider that the US is now a net exporter of oil.  Keep oil here and lower our gas prices.
9304 2018-12-13 05:54:09 Definitely going to get one! Thanks Dr. Mann for your work--taking abuse from oil companies and their hatchet men, my head-spun and ignorant evangelical brethren, corrupt politicians, and other vested interests. Imo you're a modern day saint. #DrMannRocks
9305 2018-12-13 05:54:01 Yes the "negative publicity" is crucial. Oil prices are kindle too much of public emotion . Thank for the share.

9311 2018-12-13 05:53:00 You are right.  He was in the right place at the right time and even though he tried to cut back on oil production,  circumstances foiled that and now liberals take credit for the work of others who took the risks.
9312 2018-12-13 05:52:52 I like coconut oil. Cheap & easy. Just make sure to filter it of little flecks if you need to.

9315 2018-12-13 05:52:15 i used our new blender to make a carrot, potato, radish, brussel sprout, onion, and garlic purée. blended it with oil & coated a chicken breast using it. baked crispy but still fluffy & kept the chicken from getting dry!
9316 2018-12-13 05:51:51 I don’t think those are all cause and effect actually. I am not afraid to admit that I don’t know why all of a sudden our ‘bitumen’ is not fetching what it used to when oil was much higher. And I don’t think that equalization payments have anything to do with that...

9327 2018-12-13 05:49:31 Indeed! I don't know about the oil bc dirty oil is gross, but what I learned in cooking class was one fry at a lower temp for cooking, then one at a higher to crisp the outside. That's how you get crispy and tender. One fry def doesn't do it
9328 2018-12-13 05:49:30 Most flights to Europe go over the Arctic, most flights to eastern Canada, fly along the Canadian US border.   Your airspace isn’t that important.  However, why hasn’t anyone thought of Hudson Bay for oil port.

9330 2018-12-13 05:49:24 Deny it all you want, it still doesn't change the fact that Obama, as the president you right wingers hate, signed the law that removed the ban on oil exports, approved the 1st oil refinery in America in 30 years and presided over a period of oil boom without drilling the arctic

9349 2018-12-13 05:47:54 Fresh-cut’s fine but they need to soak them to remove the excess starch and par cook them then flash fry to order so they’re crispy outside/fluffy inside. They just toss them once into oil. And the oil they use is too ‘clean.’ Just like with cast iron pans, you need some residue.

9382 2018-12-13 05:43:40 We need to compete for market share against other oil producers and to be able to ship all that we produce at a fair price. We might disagree on other issues but that is the correct stance to take on the energy sector.

9389 2018-12-13 05:42:23 I just want to remind you that Mr. Prentice said that Alberta had to "get off oil" in early 2015. I don't remember hysteria at the time.
9390 2018-12-13 05:42:14 Oil prices rose on Thursday, buoyed by a drawdown in U.S. crude stockpiles and indications that China is taking concrete steps to put a trade war truce with Washington into action.
9391 2018-12-13 05:42:09 Have we taken ANYONE'S oil ?  Seems all we do is kill leaders and brutalized their countries  ... and the "rebuild them" year after year dems AND republican

Christ “ Esther, she’s sooo beautiful with big round
eyes. He’s will heal with oil. Those who hated her
( for no reason I say ) will now LOVE her. “ I say
that’s Ivanka. I’mright
9394 2018-12-13 05:41:27 Yes, you are right. New Brunswick does &lots of it + Venezuela. Protesting without understanding the facts. Once they shut down AB... what good will it do? Want to give up your phone, car, etc? oil is needed to create renewables.  No solution yet. look at Germany = mess.
9395 2018-12-13 05:41:27 Maybe a Cape pen of some high quality cannabis oil

9398 2018-12-13 05:41:03 Every day and every dollar spent on oil and gas is a disinvestment in our future. The returns might be higher in the short-term, but it doesnt dale lint ro fall behind the curve, but that's what's happening in alberta's energy sector.

9403 2018-12-13 05:40:24 You mean books for trading oil in general or futures specifically?
9404 2018-12-13 05:40:11 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
9405 2018-12-13 05:40:07 No sh!t. Trump is messing with our Oil & Gas business down here in Texas.  He needs to cut the tariff & border crap out.
9406 2018-12-13 05:40:06 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
9407 2018-12-13 05:40:02 I use omega-3 oil I love light oil on my skin. It's one of my favorite feelings in the world. @GwynethPaltrow
9408 2018-12-13 05:40:00 Well I started my first oil fire in the kitchen. Luckily the flames died in like 10 seconds cuz we had no baking soda
9409 2018-12-13 05:39:55 If u want ur car washed and oil and filters changed, you can confidently use them. Beyond that u will be wasting it money and time.
9410 2018-12-13 05:39:50 1953 was last time the US was a net oil exporter
9411 2018-12-13 05:39:37 Ur dad's has more oil in their room then iraq

9415 2018-12-13 05:38:41 so why does the liberal government exempt imported oil from carbon tax... oops "pollution pricing" yet still charges Canadian exported oil .....they also lower emmission rates for industries yet make the middle class pay the full amount for  this carbon tax scam ?
9416 2018-12-13 05:38:39 Hey ur dad wants u to sneak peanut oil out for their bed adventures

9423 2018-12-13 05:37:42 Russian oil money is more costly than its value...
9424 2018-12-13 05:37:37 Canada must build that pipeline. The enormous cost to transition to green energy can only be achieved by selling our most valuable product; oil. Not lumber, not LNG, not coal. Only oil will pay for the infrastructure, R&D and transition costs. We also have a tight window. 10 yrs
9425 2018-12-13 05:37:19 Coconut oil is terrible. Like terrible. But I use olive oil. Like the raw type

9427 2018-12-13 05:37:11 There are already numerous cancer cures, you just aren’t allowed to know or use them. Vitamin B17, CBD oil are just a couple.
9428 2018-12-13 05:37:05 Don’t use tea tree oil if you have sensitive skin it will kill it
9429 2018-12-13 05:37:03 Glad that oil has dropped like rock 
9430 2018-12-13 05:36:44 Oil will be an obsolete industry eventually, it is a politically destabilizing and economically and ecologically destructive industry. 

If you’re interested in learning the prospects of current research in alternative energy, might I direct you to one of our many national labs.
9431 2018-12-13 05:36:40 Employment means not Goverment jobs, we don't want cheap oil, gas and also we don't want freebies
We don't want subsidiary

But will Goverment give any assurance for quality life like quality education, quality health, quality roads etc without any corruption
9432 2018-12-13 05:36:19 Wow... mentioning a Catholic(?) holiday! Didn’t see them celebrate the actual holiday of never ending oil (Hanukkah)...
9433 2018-12-13 05:36:07 whatever works for you, i don't have a lot of excess oil (anymore, it used to be so bad for me it was unreal lol) so i don't really have a need for it, on days i'm wearing makeup or feel like i need a deeper clean i'll use a makeup removing balm 1st then use my normal cleanser
9434 2018-12-13 05:36:05 Oh I get it your butt hurt seems to be the majority of socialist supporters and why they have a hate on for oil + gas workers .
9435 2018-12-13 05:36:00 Sometimes while I'm scrolling FB- I'll come across a shared Pro Alberta Oil Patch video and it's always a different dude, wearing plaid, with a mullet and Mustache doing tobacco dips and throwing f bombs at the Liberal Government.   

So creative. So original.

9437 2018-12-13 05:35:42 It devolved into some generalizations, but the basis of it is valid. We hear all of this talk about "standing by our energy industry." Caveat is it isn't the energy industry, it's the oil industry. The political and business status quo has very little interest in renewables.
9438 2018-12-13 05:35:42 เพื่อนๆในห้องคับทำไมตั้งใจอ่านประวัติศาสตร์ มากกว่าอ่านคณิตคับ555

9440 2018-12-13 05:35:23 Businesses you shop at are able to employ more people and reduce costs of consumer goods because of environmentally friendly tech.  Being environmentally concious is more economically sound, it's not at all what oil paid politicians say it is.
9441 2018-12-13 05:35:20 Nog got out of the car and the oil light came on.

9446 2018-12-13 05:34:23 Remember that oil is priced at the margin. A loss of 400k is like 0.4pct of global supply. Day after day it starts to add up. I am very surprised with the lack of any reaction. Maybe this needs to be offline for more than one week.
9447 2018-12-13 05:34:20 Subsidy to any industry is wrong in capitalistic country.  Why do we give $ to oil companies?   Supply and Demand rules should apply
9448 2018-12-13 05:34:12 Btw, any oil sama je. Yang penting tengok concentration dia. Kalau awak baru nak start, I suggest pakai yang low concentration dulu. Sebab oil ni bila pakai, rasa dia macam lemas sikit dekat kulit. Bila dah biasa baru increase the concentration ;)

9451 2018-12-13 05:33:47 Might want to look at the oil industry subsidies while at it.
9452 2018-12-13 05:33:44 My guess is being "deplorable" takes up so much time & energy, there's nothing left to devote to that kinda silliness.  
9453 2018-12-13 05:33:41 USA needs Canada's oil!
9454 2018-12-13 05:33:38 God don't make no mistakes,

9457 2018-12-13 05:33:10 I been being lazy. I usually use almond oil in the winter.
9458 2018-12-13 05:33:06 And they can take krill oil and be Red Dragon's and get thier allotted vengeance on 7.6 billion or go down in neurotoxin bliss
9459 2018-12-13 05:33:04 I have a counterproposal: instead of further intensifying our fossil fuel reliance, let's claw back all those oil subsidies and get to work on an energy infrastructure that *won't* contribute to killing everyone on the planet.
9460 2018-12-13 05:32:48 I got this bare minerals oil cleanser and I’m obsessed with it  I need more of their skin care products.
9461 2018-12-13 05:32:32 Ive been trying to sleep for the last hour but my body is refuses!!! Pls i dont even care about having dreams about drowning in oil at this point just let me sleep
9462 2018-12-13 05:32:31 Yes it is. Maybe sebab vitamin E is not a trend dan tak ramai beautician yang recommend. Selalu je nampak dekat drugstore. But compared to cosmoderm, this brand is quite pricey dan dia pure vit E. Kalau cosmoderm, dia ada tambah rosehip oil.

9465 2018-12-13 05:32:04 And three: We need to stop burning carbon. It’s just a fact. If we dont, it will cost many times more than the cost to switch just to recover every year from the ever worsening climate and ecological instability.
A last one: We are objectively freer when not relying on Saudi oil.

9468 2018-12-13 05:31:44 I don’t use any w alcohol. I use toner Bc i just feel like my cleanser doesn’t get all the oil off my face even w a face brush & it’s definitely improved my skin a lot
9469 2018-12-13 05:31:35 considering I've gone into this part of the discussion before, you're really not giving me much reason to change my mind in no longer rationalizing with you. if you decide to actually openly come in for civil discourse with a desire to learn and understand my POV we can continue
9470 2018-12-13 05:31:34 Coconut oil is garbage man
9471 2018-12-13 05:31:11 Most dispensaries actually sell a menstrual oil. It’s a topical for your tummy that should help.

9480 2018-12-13 05:30:18 Wow! My grandma thought you were no longer with us. I told her, “Thanks to emu oil Chuck’s body is hanging in there, but his mind is totally gone.” Your tweet proves I was right.
9481 2018-12-13 05:30:16 I give up
9482 2018-12-13 05:30:13 And how about mainstream media start inviting actual climate scientists and specialists to discuss and educate on climate issues instead of Big Oil lobbyists spreading their agenda. All kinds of us would be thrilled to have that platform to share real, helpful information.
9483 2018-12-13 05:30:12 My earlier tweet: Judging by the response to this tweet Americans do not respect Canada even though Canada supplies most of the oil to USA! Remember David and Goliath.
9484 2018-12-13 05:29:33 Oh no! Look into CBD oil!  It wouldn’t hurt to try.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.  So sorry for your losses. 
9485 2018-12-13 05:29:29 Serious stealing going on in NNPC and our president is not aware, the last time I checked he is the oil minister. I don't like Atiku, but Buhari fall my hand, not able to take full charge as a former military guy.

9487 2018-12-13 05:29:17 I respect people's religion, me saying he looks Educated simply means he is ignorant of the concequences of child bride.

9488 2018-12-13 05:29:12 Can I just get oil injections in my face so that my skin will stop drying tha fuuuggg out
9489 2018-12-13 05:29:05 Lol nah since I was a baby I been mixing oil & lotion together. My mother used to black if me or my sister was ashy & I think that’s lowkey why I have none. Neither does my mom or sister.
9490 2018-12-13 05:28:54 I like Vivian's idea - legal action against the eco-nuts who disguise themselves as charities . And @jkenney 's with the rapid response war room to refute the propaganda of enemies who attack our oil industry. The cavalry is on the way! (Can't come fast enough)
9491 2018-12-13 05:28:48 Holy aluminum foil for the yield! I gotta find a way to modify, maybe a brownie pan covered w/ cookie sheet then flip out to oil..

9493 2018-12-13 05:28:39 マ？？？？出来たらやろう！！
9494 2018-12-13 05:28:29 A Crock-Pot gets too hot and will spoil the oil. A rice cooker stablizes at the exact temperature that alcohol boils off. 

In a bucket, Take 2oz of cannabis, break it up into small pieces by rubbing through your hands, wear gloves.
....
9495 2018-12-13 05:28:27 There's the coal calling the oil "black."
9496 2018-12-13 05:28:23 What is the cost of not doing it?

4.5 billion to buy a bankrupt oil pipeline, maybe we can spend some money on new, better forms of energy too?
9497 2018-12-13 05:28:21 I need somebody to change my oil for me. I’m not paying $70 for this mess..... I might just YouTube how to do it myself 
9498 2018-12-13 05:28:09 اي والله صادقه
9499 2018-12-13 05:28:07 Mustard or Mayo? Is that a thing? Like a coating before it goes in the got oil? #shook
9500 2018-12-13 05:28:07 I would support separating even if he doesn't get elected as we will always have the uncertainty of another Trudeau as PM and thus no security for oil companies to come drill here.
9501 2018-12-13 05:27:58 What a “cool” idea! Any technology that keeps my CBD oil fresh for longer is great by me!
9502 2018-12-13 05:27:58 my new pill is making me more nauseous than usual.. ginger ale + lemon, zofran, and peppermint oil are the only things keeping me from getting sick :’( wanna be small

9505 2018-12-13 05:27:29 Maybe I should really go buy this almond oil tomorrow. I been putting it off for long enough 
9506 2018-12-13 05:27:23 Vote buying, when they give you half bag of rice, oil, salt, wrapper and even money to START SMALL BUSINESS, you will pay them with voting them to power.
9507 2018-12-13 05:27:21 nung time na sinasagutan ko yung oil sa NCAE nakikita ko future ko WHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHHA
9508 2018-12-13 05:27:15 True or false doesn’t matter there’s nothing that can replace oil. And solar is more toxic than nuclear waste. Wait and see how expensive they get when they have have to be PROPERLY disposed of.

9511 2018-12-13 05:26:54 I like what the #US is doing with that #SaudiArabia rebuke regarding #Yemen & the #Khashoggi matter! Atleast it's not another case of "do as we say not as we do"...Let's see if the Saudis will weaponize oil..!

9513 2018-12-13 05:25:29 Aye, but as I've said elsewhere - we might be surrounded by water, but that did us no favours either - we lost our oil money to Westminster. So instead of us being a wealthy nation, we're not. So I get the oil chat - my point was that I felt her move tonight was crass.
9514 2018-12-13 05:25:27 *DEAR MEN* before *DRIVING* that motor, plz *greese & oil* it with your hand, service it from _Burnett to booth_ , before you enter make sure you warm it, don't just Jump inside its not good!! .

9516 2018-12-13 05:25:18 I need some oil for my hair
9517 2018-12-13 05:25:00 I do understand the burger cravings: I'm far from veggie but consciously trying to reduce my meat intake.

And there are other delicious things out there...like basic white cabbage with plenty of oil and garlic...
9518 2018-12-13 05:24:52 MyCC should also investigate OPEC member coz of trying to cut oil production to ensure oil price is higher

Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression,
    the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
9529 2018-12-13 05:23:31 On this am rightly behind you, no civilization can change the rule of Allah. We must be careful and not follow the path of banu israel that mix truth with falsehood or change halal to haram.

As DL often quotes, it's all about the assets.

The iow pedl has 4 times the amount of oil in place than Horsehill. Bargain of the century ?
9535 2018-12-13 05:23:07 I live in the US. We’ll see if they do better now that they don’t have to sell oil in USD. I predict they will.
9536 2018-12-13 05:23:02 The article is actually a neat capsule of 1970s geopolitics.  Impeachment, inflation, oil embargo, detente - with a minor Nixon tax scandal thrown in for flavor.

9549 2018-12-13 05:20:42 So, one thing I don't quite get about that plastic straw ban... Instead of using oil based chemicals, people are now... chopping down trees, spending lots of energy on processing the cellulose, bleaching, forming sheets of paper, ...

I mean... uh...? Did someone do the math?
9550 2018-12-13 05:20:38 They pegged their economy to the price of oil. Oil tanks=crisis.

9556 2018-12-13 05:20:14 Yeah and that DVD was made in a dirty Chinese factory run on fossil fuels. And her DVD’s and films after made,  r shipped around the world on ships and planes using oil. While she guzzles fuels in her two mansions and huge yacht- she calls Trump greedy
9557 2018-12-13 05:20:06 Trudeau, under the constitution can fix this. he DOES NOT WANT TO! Wake up Alberta. Rachel Notley can push him to fix this — she DOES NOT WANT TO! Wake up Alberta! They both are against OIL.
9558 2018-12-13 05:19:57 So you have no idea what the green new deal is then huh? Plastic, what do you do with it? Oil and the products you use daily, how do you replace them? I can keep going all night long. You have no answers.

9561 2018-12-13 05:19:29 Lucic, Sekera and Russell contracts really hinder Oil from making any kind of reasonable add

9666 2018-12-13 05:06:27 More political money laundering whereby tax cuts go to oil and other industries and they in turn donate to their political dogs.
9667 2018-12-13 05:06:19 so @WeAreTopRamen, tonight I was feeling kind of sad and sickly.... so I made your soup for dinner (with lots of extra vegetables, and ginger juice, and sesame oil.. and now I feel healthier, and full, and comforted. THANKS.
9668 2018-12-13 05:06:08 Oil has a pretty high flash point so there will probably be no fire but if there is just let it burn out if you throw water on it you will burn down your fucking house
9669 2018-12-13 05:05:56 hoping all this lavender oil will save me tonight
9670 2018-12-13 05:05:55 Showering makes me feel gross bc of the static /loss of oil layer (you want some, prefer not having dry skin).

But I also run.. a ton. So I usually try to shower right after running and then skip on days I don’t run.

Unless late => wait for the next day to prevent sleeplessness
9671 2018-12-13 05:05:55 That article was about a grey swan event, basically worst case scenario. ROPEC would never let $20 or even $40 oil happen. Canada wouldn't either at this point. 10yr bond yield was 1.4% in Feb 2016 cause of the recession we had prior. Libya is only bullish if they stay offline.
9672 2018-12-13 05:05:54 I wish my essential oil diffuser was here now  so it could potentially help me sleep
9673 2018-12-13 05:05:26 No way oil can make it happen.

9684 2018-12-13 05:02:25 Turn your oven to 450° while it’s heating up cut your zucchini then toss it in olive oil, salt, pepper and whatever else you want. I added a little soy sauce to mine yesterday and it was delicious! Cook it on a cookie sheet for 15-20 min depending on how tender you want it.
9685 2018-12-13 05:02:09 They tried baby oil
9686 2018-12-13 05:02:07 Funny how things that are very important but not connected to the oil industry happen in a REAL govt

9689 2018-12-13 05:01:59 Hahaha , thanks . And I didn't cook it in water. I used very little olive oil. Most of that that you see is the slime from the okra because okra is already naturally slimy and sticky . I seasoned it a little and fried them before adding the spaghetti sauce.

9692 2018-12-13 05:01:18 I have decided it would still not be cutting oil production.

9695 2018-12-13 05:01:02 We are suffering frm war on Oil and then thr is ps4 vs xbox
Both are intense tho
9696 2018-12-13 05:01:00 There was no recession in 2016... If I believed in 20 oil I would be max short now. I am just giving you both sides of the argument. These Libya outage is incredibly bullish but oil is down for the week. Not much else to say.
9697 2018-12-13 05:00:56 Awww man.. not that I know of but if you ever spill oil again hurry up and put baby power on it first thing!
9698 2018-12-13 05:00:51 They think she's a city living liberal?
9699 2018-12-13 05:00:47 I'll say, I can't tell which is more amazing to me...that in 2018, people are still gullible enough to fall for the snake oil salesmen in our business or that in 2018, adults can't handle a masturbation joke (or 30).
9700 2018-12-13 05:00:46 Let's throw some oil into the fire! Maybe that will help put it out.

9704 2018-12-13 05:00:12 Paints, solvents, motor oil and fluorescent lights is generated from household waste
9705 2018-12-13 05:00:12 I think I understand where you are coming from. We freeze Iranian oil funds, you believe that money now belongs to the US, so giving them their own money back is really the US giving them billions. Only a thief and a crook would think that way.

9721 2018-12-13 04:57:53 Let me guess, Putin wanted sanctions on him and other Russian oligarchs, Wanted weapons supplied to Ukraine, and wanted the export of Russian oil blocked. Wow, I never looked at it that way.

9734 2018-12-13 04:56:31 Nobody is serious about $20 oil. $26 oil was a market share war and recession.
9735 2018-12-13 04:56:30 Leaving #COP24 and bumped into oil industry people travelling back to Canada. And we wonder why these climate talks are failing. Nice people but bottom line is the incumbents will not design the pathway away from their product #cdnpoli
9736 2018-12-13 04:56:16 I mean when you start working in hv oil tanks it's kinda like that.
9737 2018-12-13 04:56:15 Let's see... I think oil will go higher but not now.. Oil is probably dead money at best for the next 4 weeks.
9738 2018-12-13 04:55:59 Doesn't a drop of oil so quickly spread on water ? Doesn't an unattended fire turn into a ragging one ? Don't neglect the little things in life they always grow into the big things..Good morning. Jai hind..

9742 2018-12-13 04:55:48 I heard big oil support carbon tax because its another revenue stream for them for research and development of green energy.  Because big oil want to sacrifice profit for the earth and people wellbeing.

9746 2018-12-13 04:55:19 Did got some iffy China news this week. Nothing solid. They bought some soybeans and MIGHT lower tariffs on cars. They aren't buying oil yet as far as I know. More china news will send oil higher. At $54.50 the bulls come alive. The "I'm tariff man" tweet brought the market down.

9748 2018-12-13 04:55:14 I mean, we could! I don’t think it’d get people out of their cars though, right? Aren’t we extracting more oil and gas than any other country right now?

9750 2018-12-13 04:55:03 I just made one of the most amazing dinners ever.

Chicken Breast seasoned with salt, pepper, lemon juice, garlic, Parmesan cheese (little), and olive oil.
Smashed Baby Golden Potatoes, salt, pepper, rosemary, garlic, olive oil.

Baked on same pan at 400 degrees for 25 mins. Omg.
9751 2018-12-13 04:54:54 I wash Ai’lynd’s in SheaMoisture raw argan oil shampoo then I put virgin coconut oil in it a couple nights she has cradle cap bad but it works good & it smells good too

9753 2018-12-13 04:54:49 So that’s what the high five at #G20 was about. Colluding with KSA to raise oil prices.
9754 2018-12-13 04:54:31 The problem with BJP guys  is they offer defences/excuses worse than the sin/error defended. When India voted against Israel in UNHRC, BJP guys defended it as all bout crude oil. Later, the Foreign Secretary was removed and in next session India abstained
9755 2018-12-13 04:54:24 Not well enough to make up for the loss of oil revenue and the offshoot industries once Alberta leaves.
9756 2018-12-13 04:54:11 Kill the oil patch.  

We are fighting now, for our survival.  

And it is crystal clear: you are either with us, or against us. 

My children deserve a future in a strong economy.  And it’s not in Canada.
9757 2018-12-13 04:54:06 Stir in seven gallons of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.

9759 2018-12-13 04:54:03 Very relieved that it seems more likely that the problem is the car battery which when you combine with getting the oil change is waaaaaay cheaper than a new starter, thank goodness.

Pick your choice
9762 2018-12-13 04:53:46 We must "Release" Quebec from the dichotomy of hating oil yet taking equalization from "oil" provinces. So sad
9763 2018-12-13 04:53:40 Also, I expect given your purity on subject you are all for ending equalization payments to Quebec originating from Alta oil business right? That would be gross hypocrisy to accept it.
9764 2018-12-13 04:53:32 Nobody is asking to see shale stop growing. Some hope, but not many expect it to stop. They certainly aren't waiting to buy oil in the meantime over shale. The truth is, you want WTI to go lower but I can see 100 reasons why WTI is heading higher.
9765 2018-12-13 04:53:29 It does sound a lot like the pawls inside the hub are sticking in the cold - as @Nomyothercousin said, lighter oil inside the hub can help in the cold weather. Depending on the hub, if it's designed to be grease lubricated (most except Alfine 11) it might seep oil though
9766 2018-12-13 04:53:28 Ohhh no. 1,000 mg of CBD oil is WAAAYYY TOOO MUUCHH 
9767 2018-12-13 04:53:26 Are hair must be so similar... because coconut oil is NOT MY FRIEND. I was like, "How can I be BLACK and this stuff not work?!?"

9769 2018-12-13 04:53:03 Great! When can we expect lower CBD oil prices?!
9770 2018-12-13 04:53:00 Fries are full of oil and fat. 
McDonald's is the main reason for overweight kids and heart desease.
Instead of potatofries, use carrots, redbeats, parsnips and celeriacs and bake them in the oven without any oil, butter or salt, just natural.
9771 2018-12-13 04:52:55 My country is oil and Agricultural rich and poor in good governance.

It’s horrible not to oppose global warming!
9776 2018-12-13 04:51:39 Obama takes credit for the oil boom, yet he tried to stop fracking and also tried to stop further drilling offshore.

9779 2018-12-13 04:51:21 Suncor is loving it, they buy the oil for $10/bbl, refine it themselves and make a buttload on the spread ... no wonder they didn't want caps on production.
9780 2018-12-13 04:51:12 Shane just called my self tanner “some mutant Trump oil” and because of my love for self tanner I can’t tell him how clever and accurate he is

9787 2018-12-13 04:50:05 Doesn't big oil and coal arguments sound a lot like the tobacco industry's arguments against the hazards of smoking?
9788 2018-12-13 04:50:05 Totalmente de acuerdo, el asunto económico es de vital importancia, pero el trasfondo político significaría permitir que el #viejoregimen obtuviera financiamiento para sobrevivir y desestabilizar al país, ya consiguieron el presupuesto de vender Sierra Oil.
9789 2018-12-13 04:49:58 In the Mad Max franchise, everybody is out for gasoline but they NEVER mention how many oil changes are required or how they change or replenish oil out there in a desert landscape with thousands of roadless miles between fueling points found only by dumb luck.
9790 2018-12-13 04:49:31 One of the then Twitter experts in the bull market, but now a Trainer, a website operator and a Webinar Producer, once said about Nagarjuna Oil that it will cross 20 by mid 2018. 

Trapped many retail guys. Pity, it's priced at 1 now.

Crores of jobs cud hv bn created by substituting low tech imports. Cut Oil prices, raise PO intt n see how ppl react.
9803 2018-12-13 04:48:02 We have more than oil. You just can’t have national treasures in the hands of a dictator. It would work fine with our political system (if we don’t fuck it up).
9804 2018-12-13 04:48:00 @peaceforchange My dear SIR,i heard form my forefather,In 70-80"s some oil companies came in Pindori Gas/Oil field to find reserve.but they Block big oil reserve with a solid Chemicals with the back support of American,so how could American companies are in our interest. check it

9809 2018-12-13 04:47:16 I don't think so I think you are entitled to own your own property. If there is oil under it then sweet. I know why you are concerned about this but I think the risk outweigh the rewards. The government is aweful at doing everything because it is made up of flawed humans.
9810 2018-12-13 04:47:06 To the mechanic that screwed on my oil cap so damn tight, I’m ready to fight you 
9811 2018-12-13 04:46:59 I was actually watching a news story about this. I don’t think they meant to imply that it was like snake oil, I think they are pointing out that it is so unregulated that you might not be getting what you think you are getting but instead are getting literal snake oil.

9813 2018-12-13 04:46:44 CBD oil has really helped me with my pain issues. I still have the occasional day that I need to take Ibuprofen and rest. But those days are so few and far between. I haven't had to have a cortisone shot in my spine in 2 years!
9814 2018-12-13 04:46:41 Bunker oil not diesel.
9815 2018-12-13 04:46:39 No this is true. We still today have crippling sanctions on them. Their inflation rate is 1million%. Ppl that used to be middle class strive to eat with each adult working endlessly. They have the largest oil reserve in the world should say something about why we oppress them.

9820 2018-12-13 04:45:55 RE has had very little impact at the primary energy level where oil plays a key role. Solar, wind have played a minor role (5%) in electrical generation (secondary energy).
9821 2018-12-13 04:45:52 I think a timeline is easier to do once you have a strategy; then it's clearer what the goals are, and what would be needed to achieve them. e.g., Divestment can kill the oil industry, but universities have not been targeted. So how long would it take to start an occupy campaign?
9822 2018-12-13 04:45:49 literally nothing better than a fresh face slathered in oil with your hair in a bun
9823 2018-12-13 04:45:45 Even better with the findings in the Wolfcamp Shale and Bone Spring Formation in the Delaware Basin portion of Texas and New Mexico. Contains an estimated 46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.

9831 2018-12-13 04:44:34 I'm one of those "Americans" your post speaks of.  I had no part in 'unfreezing' and giving back the money that was taken when the islamic terrorists nationalized American and British oil wells.  There was no reason to let any of those billions get into the hands of islamics.

9835 2018-12-13 04:43:57 Still answering your first question but no Venezuela has free elections .well had. not sure if they will again. The reason it failed is because they had a national OIL company so everyone got microwaves and  T.V.s until the oil price fell. Then there out dated crappy equipment

9843 2018-12-13 04:41:55 Yes. They pay Americans salaries. They pay taxes and will ensure we no longer have to fight multitrillion dollar wars to protect the interests of Saudi Arabia to secure oil. Deal with the new reality that is unfolding.

9845 2018-12-13 04:41:51 You're wrong. Nobody needs $45 WTI. Seriously bad idea. You don't wish that upon a company with employees. Would you like it if someone wanted to see you get laid off for their benefit? Oil needs to be $70 WTI to be fair to both sides and spur investments for long term supply.
9846 2018-12-13 04:41:51 Look at $SN and $WFT

9851 2018-12-13 04:40:48 I'm 39, and 15 to 20 years ago, I had a lot of people tell me to move to Montana for 'the vast opportunities there'. Uh, no, besides some fleeting and migratory oil jobs here and there, which pay rather well, there's not much fluid money there.
Beautiful place, though.

9855 2018-12-13 04:40:11 The real problem is US oil shale output being up 2m+ bpd in production in over one year. Unless the pace of groeth stops one can forget any upside. One needs low prices to keep a lid on this. I am starting to think that oil is a sideways trade now.

But they are blaming a single ship a day that is only a theory right now.

9862 2018-12-13 04:39:48 Yes. But nationalize the natural resources and make the government earn its own money to pay for itself and its social plans. Why should I pay half of my income to support an inefficient government while private oil companies fill their pockets with $ sucking oil out of OUR land?

9872 2018-12-13 04:37:46 No, Private land owners cleaned up because Obama stopped approving leases on public lands and oil companies had to look elsewhere..  Plus fracking which Obama also tried to stop grew exponentially.
9873 2018-12-13 04:37:33 Bad things will always be highlighted. So think twice before saying something. BJP failed to highlight the positives of the govt. So cow vigilantism, oil price etc received hype
9874 2018-12-13 04:37:32 Agree. The recent leadership decisions have been really poor. As a fellow Eagle, you want to stay devoted, but unless involved in National Organizational decision making what impact do we have.
9875 2018-12-13 04:37:30 For comparison: oil (Venezuela's main export and foreign currency provider for +100 years) was priced in the 6 to 9$ range the previous pre chavez government (caldera), and things were A HUNDRED times better (NOT good) than today with oil at +50$. HOW CAN THAT BE? Socialism...

9887 2018-12-13 04:35:33 Spec longs being reduced is bullish. That means capitulation took place. You're just being too negative. You should move on to bonds or something you can handle I guess. This is why bears win. The bulls don't dig in and fight back. Fundamentals for oil are clearly bullish.

9890 2018-12-13 04:34:56 I think this oil bearish price action has much more to do with US shale output than Trump.
9891 2018-12-13 04:34:07 When people bring in old containers of used oil to dump, I really, really, really wish they'd clean the spiders off of them. Had one today with, like, ten of the little hellbeasts on it and they were crawling all over my hand. Do people think I like crapping my pants at work?
9892 2018-12-13 04:34:03 That said, the data does show that OEM's (especially non-German ones) may want to reconsider whether they want to keep offering diesels though, given likely regulatory challenges.  Curious to see how oil markets & refinery mixes reshuffle in the coming years.
9893 2018-12-13 04:33:58 Baths are really important for anxiety, people with muscle aches, and people who use oil and steam for their skin. Blanket labeling them as nasty is at worst just mean.

9896 2018-12-13 04:33:34 I do not know anymore... Oil only has had bullish news and this can barely hold up above the lows. This week we should again see spec long positions reduce in the COT report.

9902 2018-12-13 04:31:59 .@geography_411 There is nothing bad about the oil and mining industries.  Australia and Norway, both highly developed countries, continue to have the majority of their incomes from exporting mineral resources.

Oil, gas, lumber, gold, silver, etc... any natural riches of the country belongs to ALL the people. Common natural resources must be nationalized

9911 2018-12-13 04:30:32 it doesn't take much to push oil down. It was the Enquirer/Trump news at 2pm that knocked everything down. Trump is a liability. Everyone is out to get him and his BS is causing all the market troubles. He's a bad choice for Prez in 2020 that's for sure.

They didn’t realize that wind from that block makes a shit ton.

9921 2018-12-13 04:29:00 Yesterday late in the day price action was just very ugly. Someone really sold a good amount of oil to tank it over USD 1 in a short amount of time. Not nice.
9922 2018-12-13 04:28:51 Ok.....I'm a believer but you do realize that oil, bricks, cloth, metals, and electricity we're put to use by man. God had nothing to do with that. The alignment of planets and moon don't make for great arguments either.
9923 2018-12-13 04:28:46 The two provinces who don’t want newer technology pipelines have their own environmental issues to fix. But hey y’all still want the transfer payments from the profits of oil sales. This is the cyclical problem plaguing this issue.

9927 2018-12-13 04:27:59 I like imperialis from Lush, Pond’s, or like above all, pure olive oil. I’ll put it on before bed and it absorbs so nicely while I sleep and I’m set for the day!
9928 2018-12-13 04:27:56 That's Greenpeace et al's plan. They found a soft target in Canada. Try those shenanigans in almost any other oil and gas producing country, and they'd be lucky to escape in one piece.
9929 2018-12-13 04:27:56 Stock market came down and we held the Chinese CFO which spooked all markets. We need good news in the next few days to get the SP500 rallying again. Oil will follow. It's all about growth fears right now. Remove those and we're running higher.
9930 2018-12-13 04:27:51 My heart wants either Oil King or Daigo to win. Want F-Word to win the last chance since he's not on commentary. Sucks that he's not.
9931 2018-12-13 04:27:51 We could save a lot of time by starting at the top; shut down all the oil companies. Then replace broken political systems with participatory democracy structures. Then we have time to adapt to a high-carbon world and reverse the damage.
9932 2018-12-13 04:27:47 I think there is confusion, I support Calvin Helin/eagle spirit pipeline. I think they are the last chance for the energy sector to pave the way for oil export market beyond the US our only customer. I see you also support pipelines. Eagle spirit might pay the way for all hurting
9933 2018-12-13 04:27:33 i’m using a lavender oil diffuser, meditating, and i’m organizing my crystals. at this point I feel obligated to call myself a witch like I don’t think I have a choice?
9934 2018-12-13 04:27:29 Complexity does not imply a poor design. It's just the sign of a complex multi-variate problem. 

Also, yes the prices haven't come down after the drop in oil prices. And that's because the govt is trying to recover what it had subsidised till now.
9935 2018-12-13 04:27:27 Put on a wig, a face mask, & baby oil  fill ya brows lmao
9936 2018-12-13 04:27:22 I still pray that the government stops the oil and fracking companies from stealing Native Indigenous Reservation lands. Polluting Americans water, killing our fish.

9945 2018-12-13 04:26:13 I thought maybe you accidentally cut em off use eyeliner to fill them back in and rub coconut oil on em that’s what I did when I accidentally cut mine
9946 2018-12-13 04:25:53 Polis is low key trash. I live in Colorado and this dude made a commercial WITH his Republican opponent talking about how they both opposed a ballot measure limiting where oil companies could frack. He's a former hedge fund manager with oil money coming out of his ears.
9947 2018-12-13 04:25:48 あぁ
9948 2018-12-13 04:25:45 I got the actual Bulletproof brand of XCT oil as well as ghee, I was really amazed at how good an oily, buttery cup of coffee could be. The energy was amazing in that it wasn't a jolt, just a steady ramp up without a drop off.
9949 2018-12-13 04:25:42 あっ…
9950 2018-12-13 04:25:41 Japan was our friend. Stupid Democrats blocked their oil supply. Why do think they attacked us? It’s nothing to do with Nazi Germany.
9951 2018-12-13 04:25:31 Eberle and Hall played for themselves (each other) and had a run of the town at night. Plenty of nightlife people can validate that. Bottle service at the Bank, Industry night at Hudson’s Downtown on Monday’s, and late night rendezvous on Thursdays at Oil City.

9953 2018-12-13 04:25:30 People are also waiting on the China and Brexit news for growth fears to subside. Trump is the reason issue. He's too volatile so nobody trusts a word he says until something is final. He speaks too early. If China trade war ends, oil/SP500 take off very fast.
9954 2018-12-13 04:25:17 Oil Tanker Owners Find Solace in Shale: America's shale boom could be about to spare the world's… @environmentguru
9955 2018-12-13 04:24:27 Every president has looked the other way on Saudi Arabia because of the oil. If you want to see them file FIBA to look at them.
9956 2018-12-13 04:24:26 Nobody is going to be increasing production very far at $55 with rates going up. The bankers aren't giving away the money like they used to. The ROPEC cuts are real and Iran is on a very short lease. Libya and Canada are down too. Once oil hits $54.50 I think we're heading to $58
9957 2018-12-13 04:24:03 I’ll try the derma e detox scrub for sure ! I’ll try using tea tree oil again sometimes it just really dries out my skin :(

9960 2018-12-13 04:23:54 Hard for this to be bear trap. Oil is just so unloved right now.
9961 2018-12-13 04:23:51 I'd have to spend some time looking at the numbers. I'm betting the inability of some to implicate Saudi Arabia with Khashoggi and Yemen is entirely an economic play. We use their oil, they're the biggest buyer of our weapons. This is a good time to force some better behavior.
9962 2018-12-13 04:23:41 Yes, but remember the oil and gas revolution in the US is a relatively recent phenomenon.
9963 2018-12-13 04:23:23 Where do u get Crude oil from? - Arabs... Where do u get arms, technology n FDI from? - US n Europe. Why do u want to upset them ?

9970 2018-12-13 04:22:16 I am also starting to think that the market needs low oil prices in order to slowdown the growth of US shale oil. With WTI above 55 there is the fear that output will keep on surging. Maybe we are capped at 54-55 (in WTI) for a long time.
9971 2018-12-13 04:21:56 Oh my GOD!!!!
MINE is wheat toast bread with vegan butter olive oil avocado salt pepper and a little paprika.
9972 2018-12-13 04:21:45 1/2 And the oil and coal industry don't have an agenda or be money grubbing?  I live in Utah where just a few years ago Murray energy intentionally ignored safety concerns to save a buck costing several miners their lives, they where sued and charged with several crimes.
9973 2018-12-13 04:21:40 you should try Derma•E detox scrub!! i started using it and it actually helps with break outs and discoloration! for like really bad break outs try yea free oil!

Positives: Rebounding exports, higher industrial and agricultural output.

Negatives: dampening rural consumption, higher oil prices and rising cost of raw materials.

9989 2018-12-13 04:19:23 The investment in boosting production at the giant oil field will take most of Chevron’s US$5.1 billion upstream program for major capital projects in 2019. For this year, Chevron had allocated US$3.7 billion to the Tengiz field expansion project.

9991 2018-12-13 04:19:10 Cite your legitimate sources. I followed the situation closely & it was monitored by IAEA. The point is you are lying about giving them $. The Saudis are as great or greater a threat. They are the biggest sponsor of terror in the world, but Donald likes their $ and oil.

10000 2018-12-13 04:18:34 Actually if you noticed I tweeted flames were on second night of back to back against the oil so as I pointed out most of oilers victory goes to NHL scheduling
10001 2018-12-13 04:18:19 ولو اعتبرنا انه كان olive oil وغشيته ب parrafin هو ادي +ve مع halphen فلازم يكون فيه cotton seed oil  وغير كده لو غشيت ال olive oil ب parrafin نسبه السامبل هتنزل عن كده كمان

10004 2018-12-13 04:17:36 Hang on, it can't be that Alberta oil is for all Canadians until critics dare to use their voice, in which case they have to say where they live? Is that the game here? Are we all Albertans when it comes to paying to clean up the horrendous mess? Or Canadians? #cdnpoli
