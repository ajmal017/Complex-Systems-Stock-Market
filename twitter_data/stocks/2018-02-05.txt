No fundamental change has happened to the #blockchain space and it is therefore starting to look like the perfect entry. ETH @ USD600 is a bargain.

5 2018-02-05 23:59:07 I bot in some short puts on stocks I'd own more of AAPL, BAC, IBM, and INTC are the notables. I think I'll get a better price Tuesday or Wednesday. Was lucky to derisk by selling stock and buying Jan 19 calls last week and the prior week.

12 2018-02-05 23:58:38 Hahaha.... so true! Who’s fault is it? I would guess that Soros,and others,sold many of their stocks....
to purposely lower the Dow....
to then buy it back at a lower price...
To make yet another profit. 
Happens all the time.
Their is always manipulation with the market.
13 2018-02-05 23:58:34 Our 401Ks are also going down because greedy Wall Street doesn't like people getting raises.  Now the oligarchs are worried about inflation cutting into their wealth so they will pound stocks down to ensure we don't get anything.
14 2018-02-05 23:58:33 I was so tired of winning I sold all my stocks today.

49 2018-02-05 23:56:42 $btc is looking like one of those pump and dump penny stocks just add a few zeroes.
50 2018-02-05 23:56:37 Correction is a nothingburger.    Stocks go up & stocks go down.  Totally normal.  Stocks are now on sale.  If I'm not mistaken the market was up about 40% since POTUS took office.  Even a 20% correction wouldn't be bad.  Think
51 2018-02-05 23:56:31 @adhia03 Basic of investing in stocks -Past results are no guarantee for future returns. Among others, Stock market rise only if GDP rises.
52 2018-02-05 23:56:26 There is no blanket advice. I wish their were. Sell-offs are a process. I’d say today officially put stocks on folks’ radar. That’s a big step. Buckle up. Don’t let yourself get in position to panic.
53 2018-02-05 23:56:24 Time to buy! We got a raise and stocks went down. Time to go shopping!
54 2018-02-05 23:56:19 Seems to be the rise in the US 10-year treasury bond yield, and the Fed chair announcement a few days ago of wanting a "stable" rather than strong $US, which Trump then contradicted. Stocks been dropping ever since.
55 2018-02-05 23:56:14 I hope this sell off streak continues tomorrow. nothing makes me happier than the decline of corporate stocks.
56 2018-02-05 23:56:13 Poor Cheryl. Go check your stocks
57 2018-02-05 23:56:12 Lmfao. You over here talkin bout stocks and bonds bra
58 2018-02-05 23:56:08 they're making room for more, better stocks.
59 2018-02-05 23:56:04 Stocks are a long term investment in general. People panic too quickly.
60 2018-02-05 23:55:56 Trump's embarrassing split-screen moment as stocks tanked
61 2018-02-05 23:55:54 My boss donates to my 401k for a write-off. Otherwise it would be a waste to him. Most people I know have no 401k or stocks & will retire with no savings, because many live paycheck to paycheck. My boss happens to have a bigger heart than some. Knows I don't make enough to save.
62 2018-02-05 23:55:53 Janet Yellen's parting shots were harmful.She said the stocks were over valued and she raised interest rates, last Friday.
63 2018-02-05 23:55:35 I'm not buying it. Stocks didn't do this when Comey was fired.
64 2018-02-05 23:55:35 It is not a bear market(for stocks), it is just a correction
65 2018-02-05 23:55:32 Good thing most of the 99% can't afford stocks anyway.
66 2018-02-05 23:55:30 Just think you coulda been out there investing in stocks that whole time
67 2018-02-05 23:55:27 Just let it burn! The 1% deserves this one! The 99% can´t afford stocks anyway. 
68 2018-02-05 23:55:13 The stocks, you see, are bad now. Little market talk for ya

in #Superbowl
70 2018-02-05 23:55:02 BRUTAL!  Wipes out all this year's gains.
But a GREAT opportunity to sell some 'weaker' stocks that have not gone down as much as other stocks that now look 'stronger'.

76 2018-02-05 23:54:36 @StockTwits how is there a max number of stocks in your watch list ? Buy some band width you clowns
77 2018-02-05 23:54:29 Actually Joe likely has stocks in his company retirement plan or his 401K. Susie homaker pays no tax as she has no income.
78 2018-02-05 23:54:26 There’s always a correction when stocks are over inflated the economy was so unstable during the previous administration if you’re familiar with the market you knew it was going to happen it was a ? of when = check how many times fed’s raised interest rates  #StockMarketCrash
79 2018-02-05 23:54:20 <Trump is elected.  Stocks soar on speculation that he will kill the poor.>

Pundit making $30k a day:  Business is booming!  Look at this economy!

<After a year stocks slump a little.>

Pundit still making $30k a day:  These are such trying, uncertain times.
80 2018-02-05 23:53:56 and your stocks are going down
81 2018-02-05 23:53:52 Are you kidding me? Stocks go up - Trump gets the credit, stocks go down - It’s not his fault! How can you even say that with a straight face?
82 2018-02-05 23:53:46 According to Dr. Savage, Janet Yellen said the stocks were over valued and she raised interest rates, last Friday on her way out of the job. He believes this was a coordinated effort to hurt Potus.
83 2018-02-05 23:53:43 I just look at it like the stocks I'm about to purchase are going on sale.
84 2018-02-05 23:53:39 Stocks are low but the trump dickriding seems to be at an all time high 
85 2018-02-05 23:53:24 stocks and bonds are con artist dream ! i can sell stocks and bonds i dont even own ! for cents on the dollar . ak" option tradeing "  you can put a option on amazon to sell 2 trillion shares .
86 2018-02-05 23:53:12 Would not surprise me to find out dems & their Hollywood friends purposely planned to sell stocks to make dow drop.Hmm#trump
87 2018-02-05 23:53:04 Dow to keep going down until March, according to one of the best experts...Just forget you own stocks and look at it in the summer.
88 2018-02-05 23:53:01 .@CaseyNesitat If you hold (don't panic sell), most stocks will recover. Especially the techs. In 2007 we never sold anything, and everything recovered and then went sky high.
89 2018-02-05 23:52:52 Gartman on Bloomberg - "Substantive bear market on stocks has begun" BUY BUY BUY!!!! BTFD!!!!
90 2018-02-05 23:52:50 Gartman on Bloomberg calling for a substantive bear market in stocks...which means we've probably bottomed!
91 2018-02-05 23:52:47 haha! is it just me, or do bond prices become more important than stocks rn? stocks can sustain a fair drop, but if bonds sell off because of risk parity, VAR, margin calls, whatever, then we are in real, real trouble i think..
92 2018-02-05 23:52:30 RIP my stocks today.
93 2018-02-05 23:52:27 They are taking profits & getting out before the $hit hits the fan.  Only 47% own stocks, & most middle class only have them in 401K so they aren't personally buying & selling. The people making money are the upper class, not the middle class that 45 said he would care for.

95 2018-02-05 23:52:23 Stocks going way down...hey dude!! If you’re going to brag about the market when it’s up, who you gonna blame when it falls lower than ever?
96 2018-02-05 23:52:18 @realDonaldTrump bro, what's up with stocks? Can't you talk to someone? #MAGA #hamsandwich #yolo
97 2018-02-05 23:52:14 It’s that it dropped 4.6%in a single day. That’s a reminder of 2008. If you paid attention you would see trump is being recognized for some of the stock market gains over the past year.Not all credit is given to him because stocks were rising at about the same rate as under Obama
98 2018-02-05 23:52:13 It is a good time to buy stocks. When the markets drop like this I look at it as a buying opportunity.
99 2018-02-05 23:52:03 Saying Trump is responsible for a crash after a year of being President is actually more plausible than Trump being elected then immediately saying “MAGA, our POTUS is strengthening the economy and stocks are soaring” then a year later saying “Well Obama did it again!”
100 2018-02-05 23:52:01 As an owner of some stocks, I desperately want Congress to flood the labor market with immigrants so the Fed doesn't have to worry about wage inflation. Wage earners want the opposite. Seems as clear a class divide as you can have.
101 2018-02-05 23:51:59 1.5 billion stocks on the NYSE alone. In 1896 there were like 39. So 30 probably seems like overkill.
102 2018-02-05 23:51:59 يا رب
103 2018-02-05 23:51:39 Almost time to buy stocks
104 2018-02-05 23:51:32 Watching the Stock Market News today is kind of like the world ending but we still all get to watch it on our 80 inch smart TVs. #stocks #endofthefingworld
105 2018-02-05 23:51:26 dow is low so more people will be buying stock at a lower cost.Just like when it's high they sell there stocks.
106 2018-02-05 23:51:18 I'm very curious to know who owned/sold their stocks.

I smell a 
107 2018-02-05 23:51:07 and stocks are wayyyy down.  Watch interest rates soar.
108 2018-02-05 23:50:56 Go early go hard go ... stocks?
109 2018-02-05 23:50:51 Yea but certain stocks will be bullish again soon.
110 2018-02-05 23:50:49 If you have money in the #StockMarket via stocks or funds and you’re within 5 years of needing to SPEND that money (retirement,home etc) ....start moving that money to something more stable and do it on a monthly basis. Dollar coast averaging is your friend.
111 2018-02-05 23:50:37 Hmm okay.. Any specific details or can I pickup few coins on Stocks Exchange and leave them.. ? thnx
112 2018-02-05 23:50:26 There’s a solid chance that he says “stocks have never been more affordable” by the end of his term
113 2018-02-05 23:50:19 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years. Two days of steep losses have erased the market's gains from the start of this year and ended a period of record-setting calm for stocks. (Feb. 5) AP
114 2018-02-05 23:50:13 I didn’t check my stocks today and the Dow fell 1,000 points...I’M SORRY INVESTORS
115 2018-02-05 23:50:10 Plus, now might be a great time to pick up some of those stocks at bargain prices before they rise again...
116 2018-02-05 23:50:04 $XIV confession: was short up to my eyes 3 months ago. Thought easy trade, this is ticking time bomb. Covered some on abc fake news in Dec and then more and more each day as it appeared markets broken and stocks would never go done. Covered last lot Jan 26
117 2018-02-05 23:49:59 Oh, I'm waiting, LH.
I'm hanging onto my @Aurora_MMJ, @Zoomer, @Cannabix_BLO and @HydroOne stocks against my better judgement.
That said, I may pull up stakes once this crisis is over.
118 2018-02-05 23:49:55 Get ready to buy back into stocks boys
119 2018-02-05 23:49:18 No wonder he's been so down about things recently. Though, have we adequately appreciated the possibility that these dipping stocks are just crisis actors?
120 2018-02-05 23:49:17 Are mutual funds, 401k's and IRA's counted as "stocks" for this purpose?  The story is kinda fuzzy on it.  They're just as subject to the up and down market frenzy as individual stocks, and likely paint a picture of how many Americans invest.
121 2018-02-05 23:49:10 "These lows"....stocks are far from any lows....the mkt has been almost straight up for 8 years. now it has two down days in a row only 5.3% correction...
122 2018-02-05 23:49:05 That's why the biggest drop happened while the fool gave a speech re: tax cuts. Get real. Big companies inflated their stocks, got excited about Trump's promises, then realized it's all going to come crashing down soon. We've known about upcoming interest increase for awhile now.
123 2018-02-05 23:48:59 Bought $ABBV $INTC between 3:20-3:35 today, definitely didn’t get the low but bought 2 #stocks I think bounce higher. 17% cash, up .8% as of today’s close. Looking to use more cash if market flushes again #investing #trading #TomsTruths
124 2018-02-05 23:48:26 Never, in my time examining deep value stocks, have I ever once heard a management team admit they sht the bed.  Always some other viable alternative fault.
125 2018-02-05 23:48:06 When unemployment is low, inflation risk increases. But @SenDeanHeller proudly adds fuel to the fire, and borrows a $trillion to finance tax cuts (for the top 1%).  Increased govt. borrowing crowds the bond market.  Bond yields rise. Stocks go down.  @DeanHeller you are clueless.
126 2018-02-05 23:48:02 Sucks seeing red, but it makes it alot easier to buy!

128 2018-02-05 23:47:55 A few other stocks I picked up after they went on sale this afternoon: $DSW @ $19.00, $JBSS @ $59.59, $PZZA @ $57.96, $VEC @ $28.59.
129 2018-02-05 23:47:48 Stocks are down like shit right now. Now’s a great time to buy.
130 2018-02-05 23:47:46 Some people's retirements have been invested in the stock markets, true, but this is a monstrously terrible thing and should never have happened in the first place. The value of stocks themselves reflect nothing but the opinions of "traders", and fuck those guys.
131 2018-02-05 23:47:42 A handful of cities and states are moving to ban bump stocks. It's a start. And a damned good one.
132 2018-02-05 23:47:36 Rich people sell stocks, make a bunch of money, price of stocks go down.

Then they buy up the cheap stocks, raising the price. Rinse and repeat.

It's a broken system.
133 2018-02-05 23:47:34 I think @CNBC has just been a "Buy America whatever the price" booster the past year. There are some amazing companies & execs but eg 36x EV/pre tax OCF for stocks like $AMZN is "Go Go Years" stuff.
134 2018-02-05 23:47:29 It's the spring sell off. Don't believe the bs.

Look, the traders take their gains all year.  What stocks to buy? They are all overpriced. They will dramatize the drop to "create" bargains. Stop being sheep.
135 2018-02-05 23:47:14 Stocks drop a record 1100 points today, we had to hear you brag that the market was up because of your policies now when are you gonna own this huge drop #WorstPresidentEver
136 2018-02-05 23:47:13 Name one time in history that happened? So the US is defaulting, can’t borrow to pay bills, Medicare and social security disbursement cut and people will buy stocks as the economy and earnings Accelerate?
137 2018-02-05 23:46:57 Get in now....stocks on sale!
138 2018-02-05 23:46:52 Stocks have gone up more than reasonable. Probability of correction rises if valuations rise faster than underlying growth in earnings.  That said, underlying growth in companies is improving dramatically.  The stock market is NOT the economy.
139 2018-02-05 23:46:49 it's funny to me that news trucks are out here the moment #DowJones plunges, didn't see them lined up when the stocks were sky-high at 26k at the @NYSE ! #WallStreet
140 2018-02-05 23:46:40 See stocks today Donnie?  Not your fault if they go down but only take credit when their up?
141 2018-02-05 23:46:27 Thats how they make big money sell frenzy...make stocks  drop.... They go buy at lower price. Can almost see a bit of manipulation in the market. Hmmmm
142 2018-02-05 23:46:26 If you have a defined benefit plan (70+% of govt & union workers) or a 401k, your future depends in part on stocks.  But let it crash and stick it to the Man.
143 2018-02-05 23:46:18 The plunge in US stocks has infected Australian shares - the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 2.7 per cent at the open with all sectors trading weaker. #austshares #USStocks @AAPNewswire
144 2018-02-05 23:45:32 Deregulating Wall Street + artificial inflation (corporate buybacks) + 30% tariff on solar panels/washing machines + massive job layoffs = I switched my stocks to bonds in my 401k this morning.
145 2018-02-05 23:45:23 at least that extra $1.50 a week will buy some stocks now.

#StockMarketCrash #TrumpCrash #OrangeMonday
146 2018-02-05 23:45:11 USA has lost 3 trillion dollars lost the biggest drop in history in a day rip USA stocks
147 2018-02-05 23:45:07 7 trillion dollars has entered the market since the election  
 
Sell off is good
 
Good time to buy more stocks
148 2018-02-05 23:44:56 What about all that talk of no correlation between BTC and stocks? Doesn't that fact alone make BTC safe?
149 2018-02-05 23:44:50 THE STOCKS DROPPED '666' AS PAY BACK FOR TRUMP RELEASING THE MEMO AGAINST THE DEMONS...
150 2018-02-05 23:44:48 Reinvested Capital (profit) is one of the miracle of Capitalism. The money can be borrowed... you can buy a car 0% down,  a house 10% down. You can start your own business and create job for others. Buy stocks and bonds and help other companies financially.
151 2018-02-05 23:44:34 Hey @realDonaldTrump, are you gonna take credit for the tremendous drop in Stocks and Dow also? Or whose fault is that?
152 2018-02-05 23:44:25 Spikes of 50% or more in the $VIX  in a single day, have led to rallies in stocks over the next 1-6 months EVERY TIME!
153 2018-02-05 23:44:14 Can't be, the left swears that is not how stocks work
154 2018-02-05 23:44:12 If today's college students are America's future, then people should invest heavily in cardboard and crayon stocks. Materials used for protest signs. Especially California
155 2018-02-05 23:44:10 So.. is now a good time to buy Dow Jones stocks or no? 
156 2018-02-05 23:44:08 The feds raised the interest rate on borrowing money so investors cashed out their stocks and took their profits. No big deal.
157 2018-02-05 23:44:06 The dashboard for my #401k does not show today's drop. This is #goodux for today. #uxdesign #stocks #jackupthedowjones
158 2018-02-05 23:44:06 Damn crypto red, and stock market red....straight blood bath...but people #dontpanic about crypto I'm not to sure tho it has just been down hill still...it goes by to much FUD...stocks at least you know it will trend up due to many things
159 2018-02-05 23:44:05 @AliVelshi @sruhle BIG market drop because of health @EdKrassen insurance news of Jeff Bezsos, Warren Buffet, & Jamie Dimin wanting 2 start their own health insurance & @Amy_Siskind everyone is selling Drug Manufacturer, Drug/Big Pharma & Health Insurance Stocks? Think So!
160 2018-02-05 23:44:04 Gosh, hope former CDC employee Fitzgerald's tobacco stocks survive the plunge.
161 2018-02-05 23:43:55 I think you are missing the point. 1 trillion is being subtracted from the government balance sheet and added to (primarily) corporate capital. Obviously stocks are going up. Today's event is a dislocation in the derivatives market.
162 2018-02-05 23:43:54 Cryptocurrencies and stocks ain’t doing too hot today.
163 2018-02-05 23:43:45 Uh hello? Its not. You go by percentage, not points. Liberals decided to sell off their tech stocks and others to F with .@realDonaldTrump. But its not going to work. Our economy is too strong thanks to Trump and unemployment is way down.
164 2018-02-05 23:43:39 @adhia03 Sir r u equating investing in & earning from stocks as some consider selling pakoras to begging? Shame! @rajeev_mp @TVMohandasPai
165 2018-02-05 23:43:28 ههههههه 
166 2018-02-05 23:43:24 It could also be due to a strong bond market. People may be moving their investments from stocks to bonds. But, lower stock prices creates great buying opportunities.
167 2018-02-05 23:43:19 the biggest, greatest, best ever @realDonaldTrump: Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the BIGGEST point decline in history during a trading day.
168 2018-02-05 23:43:09 MSM and liberals in general have become nothing more than a punchline these days. Trump gets no credit for great economy or stock market, but when correction happens and stocks fall, IT’S ALL TRUMP’S FAULT. You can’t make this up
169 2018-02-05 23:43:01 Why is that Dumbo not bragging about stocks today? If you still believe a word he’s saying, you’re a damn fool.
170 2018-02-05 23:42:50 Cause corporations started buying back their stocks. It was artificially inflated, now it's going through a correction. Thank the #TaxScamBill.
171 2018-02-05 23:42:30 You better go Sell some stocks lady. The Trump train has crashed
172 2018-02-05 23:42:28 Garbage. It’s thanks to the EU we’ve had sustainable stocks to fish. If it had been up to the likes of that fat self-serving Tory up in Peterhead, it would all be sucked up and straight into their bank accounts. It’s their greed that had many fishers support Brexit, nothing else.
173 2018-02-05 23:42:24 And this is related to bump stocks how?
174 2018-02-05 23:42:22 My finance class was picking stocks by throwing darts at a board today haha
175 2018-02-05 23:41:45 Yeah they were tired of winning.
Made others lose. Smells like some Algorithm went nuts.
The big boys raked the profit in, small time investors with a few stocks suffer huge slump.

As usual : the devil shits on the biggest pile. Going up when smbdy needs it
176 2018-02-05 23:41:24 im confused - so Tom Brady gets robbed of the super bowl, stocks sell-off in the morning, then vol etn's explode, then stocks sell off, then more vol, ad infinitum? that about right?
177 2018-02-05 23:41:16 I’ve been working all day. Can you tell me how the stock market is doing? Ask for a rich friend who can afford to buy stocks.
178 2018-02-05 23:41:00 In anticipation of the market's bloodbath today, should I sell my stocks or keep them until the market gains again? 
179 2018-02-05 23:40:48 Tell idiot liberals to stop manipulating the market selling their tech stocks.
180 2018-02-05 23:40:43 We are getting a deal on stocks though, right? Prices are dropping like crazy- pick some up before they’re gone!
181 2018-02-05 23:40:41 Ok Stocks 101:  When people sell off,,,that is GREAT TIME to BUY IN!  It all equals out in the long run!  Dow been going up up up up for so long..needed to come down to equal out some!  It was expected and now will slowly climb back up once people start buying again @ lower price
182 2018-02-05 23:40:35 U seem like a very knowledgeable person in stocks, u think the market went up because of racist #Trump or it was policies laid out from past decade by @BarackObama 

Think hard.
#StockMarketCrash #stocks #ImpeachTrump #MAGA
183 2018-02-05 23:40:25 If the last few days have taught us anything is that algos should not be allowed to sell stocks
184 2018-02-05 23:40:24 If you bought stocks/crypto when they went up and are panic-selling now, I've got news for you: you're stupid. #StockMarketCrash #crypto
185 2018-02-05 23:40:18 @NinaMalone thanks for the follow. Would love to get you down to 1 of our @actorawareness night's aswell to show you our up and coming working class talent. I feel us and Identity fight for the same sort of values.
186 2018-02-05 23:40:10 I thought the NFC winning the SuperBowl was suppose to be good for stocks. #fakenews
187 2018-02-05 23:40:06 Sold some $NVDA at open to buy more $CANN.C $CHV & watching $THCX $EMC $IMH $MARI $RKS ... Got out of most tech stocks 1 week ago, now only holding $NVDA $AMZN $SHOP in tech, will swing more to #potstocks after ER
188 2018-02-05 23:39:56 Pete does the “3 day rule” apply now before buying beaten down stocks  to allow for the inevitable margin calls to flush out of the system?
189 2018-02-05 23:39:55 Ye Modi ki chaal hai.... before ex UPA minister could make his move, his stocks in USA crashed 
190 2018-02-05 23:39:45 Trump, stocks way way thru the roof. Full time jobs . Big companies re investing in America. Black unemployment lowest ever!
Worldwide respect is back.Isis is crushed.The terrorist loving UN and So called palestinians aid cut .
191 2018-02-05 23:39:41 Stocks are going way down too! Are you own that like you bragged about how they were up? Newsflash: the stocks have ZERO to do with you.
192 2018-02-05 23:39:19 Bonds will go down either 1) gradually over time as economic growth accelerates, no bubble bursting or 2) sovereign default, whereby both stocks and bonds crash, like Greece. Nobody calls for 2) on the bond bubble bursting thesis
193 2018-02-05 23:39:11 Pay attention to your stocks I manage my own because of this type of thing. Sold off one that was crashing hard. You have to be in control of your own stuff to make gains.
194 2018-02-05 23:39:09 @JayendraGokhale Should I wait a bit to invest in stocks because of the current downward trend? Or buy now?
195 2018-02-05 23:39:06 Must have not had stocks for the last year then because your overall gain would far outweigh today’s loss.
196 2018-02-05 23:38:55 The market is crashing bc people are selling their stocks to buy up all the cheap bitcoin
197 2018-02-05 23:38:54 Looked at some Spanish stocks... same as in US we are close to the low ... looking to buy some Banco Santander for a trade...$SAN
198 2018-02-05 23:38:49 Some people just went belly up betting on $XIV. Always stay away from this action crap #Trading. If u seek action, it will bite u eventually...  #stocks $qqq $spx $twtr $amzn
199 2018-02-05 23:38:34 The stock market is NOT the economy.
I knew that when Trump was bragging about rising stocks and I realize it's the same now that stocks are falling.
It's just fun to point out Trump knows nothing about the stock market so he's probably mad it's falling right now.
200 2018-02-05 23:38:20 Am always welcoming new members. We trade it all. Pot stocks, crypto, options, etc. #TradeWithMoonshine
201 2018-02-05 23:38:11 This was inevitable Stocks have been "bubble priced" here lately
202 2018-02-05 23:38:10 People don't understand journalism and now listening to callers on Jim Cramer's CNBC show I realize they know nothing about stocks and markets either.
203 2018-02-05 23:38:03 Stocks have been going up up up for so long. I think this is the 2nd longest bull market ever. A correction was overdue. Plus a lot of the stock market is now computer driven programs.
204 2018-02-05 23:37:59 Even @foxnews broke away from fake @potus’ so-called speech to report on stocks dropping. Do trumpers see the pattern now? It was an unspoken denial—which he has a pattern of not acknowledging anything negative. He’s putin’s coffee boy.
205 2018-02-05 23:37:38 If there is a specific policy that he’s responsible for that is proven to be causally related to a temporary movement in stocks, then I will gladly assign blame to him. But the certainty of most commentators on one or the other explanation is absurd.
206 2018-02-05 23:37:31 I've honestly been expecting stocks to plummet but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with. 
207 2018-02-05 23:37:29 Hey, how about that stock market? Not talking...#stocks #WorstPresidentEver #MuellerTime #FakeTaxCut
208 2018-02-05 23:37:22 Why Are there say sell your stocks before the rich guys do and gobble up yours
209 2018-02-05 23:37:05 it’s not enough! stocks drop 6% at one stage and AUD only 1-2%, lol.
210 2018-02-05 23:36:58 Selloff wipes out about $2 trillion in value from global stocks the past 2 days
211 2018-02-05 23:36:56 Usually I joke about the #DowJones stocks in a “I don’t know squat about stocks” kind of way but now I’m genuinely concerned what the HECK is going on with that squiggly line??!
212 2018-02-05 23:36:44 The Stocks Have Plummeted and The Whole Year's Savings on the Stock Market Is Gone and they're Are Visitors on the Parkway with The Back Lights Being Red on the Back End of the Cars, Gather The Food, The Medicine, The Insurance, And Make Use and Stop Waste/Fraud/Abuse of O.M.B.
213 2018-02-05 23:36:32 SELL EVERYTHING, BUY BITCOIN, SELL BITCOIN, BUY STOCKS, SHORT THE BOND MARKET. mostly just #lol and #HoldOnForTheRide
214 2018-02-05 23:36:29 The Dow plunged 1500 points today. This is terrible news for anyone who owns those 30 stocks and literally no one else because The Dow is stupid.
215 2018-02-05 23:36:24 Just noticing some really strong stocks that didn’t budge much in today’s sell off. Adding a couple to watch list.
216 2018-02-05 23:36:15 People are dumping stocks so they can buy this Bitcoin dip. #cryptocurrency #btc $ltc $vtc $eth
217 2018-02-05 23:36:13 Idiots don't realize these rapid swings are because people don't buy and sell stocks anymore, machines do. And they have Stop where the sell. But they also have Buy points, and will buy it up almost as fast. Trump has absolutely nothing to do with how those machines behave.
218 2018-02-05 23:36:13 Seems like a couple/few mj stocks expanding to Australia today. $LG seeming less and less special
219 2018-02-05 23:36:12 Not after what stocks did today.  Boy did you guys not see that coming?  Too bad @realDonaldTrump is spending all his time tweeting stupid 12 year old rants about stupid stuff.
#VoteDEM2018
220 2018-02-05 23:36:11 1600 point plunge in stocks. Gas prices surging. And we get an extra $1.50 in our paychecks. Well shoot Donnie, i dont know where i will spend that windfall, maybe at one of your shitty resorts. #loser #MAGA #trump #TrumpIsAMoron #stablegenius #NOWALL #StockMarketCrash #usodum
221 2018-02-05 23:36:07 Hahahah, im no guru so who gives a shit what i trade. But if you want names, i got stopped out bunch of trend following stocks, sold few to lock in gains ( $slb and $ea ) and bought $AAPL $AMZN and $TViX for hedge.
222 2018-02-05 23:35:59 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is an index filled with stocks of 30 companies of their choosing. One Dow Jones stock is $24,345.75.
223 2018-02-05 23:35:57 The height of #GOPocrisy? trump failing to mention #StockMarket losses today, after bragging & taking credit when stocks were up.  #DoubleStandards
224 2018-02-05 23:35:55 It's so funny that the @POTUS has spent the last 10 months convincing us the Dow Jones and stock market are the economy… only to hit a wall today and now they're trying to remind us that the DJ and stocks are not the economy.
225 2018-02-05 23:35:54 Corrections are useful to buy oversold companies (stocks) with great value. Easier said than done since "bottom" is a huge question mark.
226 2018-02-05 23:35:53 Today we had the biggest, greatest, most beautiful drop in stocks ever! Buhlieve me! #MAGA
227 2018-02-05 23:35:44 and my stocks?
228 2018-02-05 23:35:28 Why are Dems blaming Mr Trump for the #StockMarketCrash? It's obvious this was caused George Soros selling his stocks to pay for the fake Democrat memo.
229 2018-02-05 23:35:21 Demand of the advertisers. There's no "turmoil" in healthy corrections, they are a good thing for stocks. Panic helps no one.
230 2018-02-05 23:35:18 MJ stocks were the only good ones to own today. I took an ass kicking in everything else. All my MJ was up except for LG. Personal demon....

233 2018-02-05 23:35:10 Alright y’all are dumb. Everyone knows that stocks go up and down and it pays off long term.
234 2018-02-05 23:35:06 Fuck Stocks
235 2018-02-05 23:35:00 Historic drop in the stock market!  Are you taking credit for that too? #stocks
236 2018-02-05 23:34:56 US stocks plunge. AUD/USD falls for a 6th straight day ahead of RBA meeting. GBP finally tumbles on politics and poor UK data #ausbiz
237 2018-02-05 23:34:55 Had to sell my stocks and regroup. The market whooped my ass this past week what the fuccccck
238 2018-02-05 23:34:49 Moelis has lifted price target for Big Un $BIG to $5.63 from $5.48. Buy rating retained on continued growth in subscribers #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
239 2018-02-05 23:34:43 Stocks are falling, businesses are closing, one government shutdown, we are facing another soon. All under your watch. Wonder how hard your people's wallets have to get hit, before they turn on you?
240 2018-02-05 23:34:30 I view stocks as an indicator of business health while tax reduction and the tightening of immigration policies protects our workers. Great age we live in when the administration can see the benefit in both encouraging business while supporting the working class.
241 2018-02-05 23:34:23 Most people aren’t understanding what’s happening. It’s not the economy collapsing lol. Stocks soared for over a year. It’s over bought because of confidence. It’s a good and healthy thing they level off. Stock values are based on profits and what they can pay shareholders
242 2018-02-05 23:34:18 I sold all of my stocks because I'm spooked by the market but also because I'm not necessarily opposed to the economy collapsing
243 2018-02-05 23:34:16 Taper tantrum mark 2. In spite of the bluster about the real economy, we remain driven by and dependent on monetary policy. #Dow #stocks #bubble
244 2018-02-05 23:34:08 Now's the time to get in on stocks that were too expensive.  We still have a slight sell off coming so proceed cautiously.
245 2018-02-05 23:34:04 What’s amazing is that we don’t even know the root cause of the downturn in stocks... oh wait it’s an inflation scare - Fed is going to help that by printing more dollars! #popcornready
246 2018-02-05 23:34:03 1)There has not been a rise in both. you haven't read into anything at all. Do you even know about the financial markets or are you just parroting what you hear?? Stocks and bonds are on sale right now and you can't even bother to notice this does not happen often. This is our
247 2018-02-05 23:33:52 I love how the financial geniuses are going off on Tesla and Apple confirming their pet theories about value.

Stocks all over the world are starting to fall. Trump is triggering a depression. A full-on blowout. But CNBC and Murdoch's toy media can't say that.

Should have sold.
248 2018-02-05 23:33:52 You repeating what you heard or you have actually looked at stocks lately?
249 2018-02-05 23:33:39 Why? BTC is not correlated to Stocks in any way.
250 2018-02-05 23:33:38 Can confirm that I lose most of my stocks to the Metal Boss fights.
251 2018-02-05 23:33:35 Market drops are part of owning stocks. There always has to be a correction. As long as the economy stays strong the markets will do well
252 2018-02-05 23:33:25 The stock market took a big hit today. I’m glad I sold most of my stocks at a high price. Those same stocks are now worth less than my initial investment. #BuyLowSellHigh
253 2018-02-05 23:33:17 stocks are droppin like flies....u got nothing to say???? asswipe twittertwatTRUMP

255 2018-02-05 23:33:16 If you bought stocks way before today and didn't sell, I feel bad for you son.

If you have money to burn, then this is the best time to buy.
256 2018-02-05 23:33:09 Once the economy grows, the only way to control resources is by increasing the price, u do the same with money in banks( loans), companies hold the selloff or let go of stocks depending the growth, so more hiring less selloff, market dwn
257 2018-02-05 23:33:01 Y'all know the Dow Jones is just an index containing 30 stocks, right?
258 2018-02-05 23:32:54 Unless you own stocks. You just got trumped!!
259 2018-02-05 23:32:54 The market was rising because of the Fed printing money and giving it to banks who funneled it into stocks. Remember QE 1,2,3,4? Not supported by economic growth! If Obama would have helped economy you could have bragged!
260 2018-02-05 23:32:49 Yes hello @realDonaldTrump why are my stocks going bank down????? I NEED ANSWERS!!!!!!
261 2018-02-05 23:32:44 All sectors are contributing to the selloff on the Aussie market this morning. 198 of the 200 stocks on the #ASX 200 are down #ausbiz
262 2018-02-05 23:32:39 Chart is meaning less if you don’t understand it. I made 30% on my stocks and so did the wife and that adds up to nearly 45,000 dollars. How much did you make?
263 2018-02-05 23:32:32 fully believe if i was born without any of my mental illnesses i wouldve been an astronaut or astrophysicist but whatcha gonna do *stocks shelves*
264 2018-02-05 23:32:27 sorry bro they will shut down in 1 sec again the moment the markets open tomo.!! theres already heavy sell orders on stocks... SEC will have all the time to drag the issue FUD and buy bitcoin at 3k
265 2018-02-05 23:32:08 Where do you think the money for those tax cuts will come from my economic genius? Your government will be borrowing to cover them. Who buys American debt? Lots of foreign governments. To cover their risk they will want higher interest rates. Bond rates rise, stocks fall.
266 2018-02-05 23:32:00 Percentage-wise it's no big deal. But when humans were buying and selling stocks, things couldn't move that fast. But it's not people out there buying and selling anymore...it's machines. Get used to it...these things will become increasingly more frequent.
267 2018-02-05 23:31:50 Still way higher then it was on Obamas last day Libtard.Know what ur talkin about before ya tweet.Stocks still WAY UP FOR THE YEAR.PERCENTAGES STILL A RECORD FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR.We get it no job no401k no dog in the race,but u still shouldnt cheerlead negative for ,Dip
268 2018-02-05 23:31:42 Excuse me but stocks do matter to the average worker/ it’s called a 401k
269 2018-02-05 23:31:40 I lost a TON of money today in stocks and didn’t even notice till now. Man I love winning the Super Bowl
270 2018-02-05 23:31:06 @jimcramer Why do you not short stocks or instruments? It would have made a ton the past week.
271 2018-02-05 23:30:58 Wrong George W bailed out the banks on Oct. 3rd, 2008. More than 1 month before President Barack Obama was elected and 3 months before he was sworn in. President Obama loaned American auto co money, which they had to pay back b4 they could sell stocks again.
272 2018-02-05 23:30:51 tinfoil hat on:

dems sell their stocks
release a damning memo
blame trump
buy back stocks
273 2018-02-05 23:30:47 Dear XRP Hodler, Be transparent which stocks did you buy during this fake dip? ;) Love, Papa bear.
274 2018-02-05 23:30:44 I will not look at my stocks
I will not look at my stocks
I will not look at my stocks
I will not look at my stocks...

275 2018-02-05 23:30:34 #Stocks | Today was a classic risk-off day when so much of the selling is going to be program trades based on technicals. It cleans up some of the people who are on the fence. You got the irrational exuberance out of the market. cc. @philblancato $DJIA $VIX $XIV
276 2018-02-05 23:30:30 S&P Futures have broken the previous day's low for 5 days in a row. The run last extended to 6 days on 6 January 2015, 778 trading days ago #stocks
277 2018-02-05 23:30:28 When stocks drop its time to buy! It's that simple! When it's high you sell and so the story goes!
278 2018-02-05 23:30:27 It will affect the savings ratio which has been driven down by rising wealth - including stocks. But even after the recent tumble S&P is basically flat since star of year.  So we wouldneed to fall a lot further for it to change the macro outlook.
279 2018-02-05 23:30:26 Pete just my opinion several stocks are still off support. I’ll use it to gauge buying. Ex. Watching cbrl at 160 I’ll start back in. 48 on gnrc. Which she’s held pretty well past 2 days.(dn 1.4%) They may overshoot little though.
280 2018-02-05 23:30:20 That sudden dive is just a lot of computers hitting their Stops and auto-selling. The Buy markers will hit and it will go up just as fast. This is how it is now folks. People aren't buying and selling stocks...machines are.
281 2018-02-05 23:30:19 “If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea. It’s the worst possible thing you can do, because people are so sensitive to short-term losses. If you count your money every day, you’ll be miserable.” Daniel Kahneman
282 2018-02-05 23:30:15 Sell stocks; Bitcoin is on sale!
283 2018-02-05 23:30:07 Your stocks may be taking a hit, however. Funny, this started the day of your self-serving paean to His Royal Pain.
284 2018-02-05 23:30:06 There is a lot more to stock valuation than the simple relationship between the risk free bond yield and earnings yield on stocks. However, these numbers illustrate how vulnerable the market was to a pull back, once the tide of sentiment turned. @ricspooner_CMC
285 2018-02-05 23:29:55 And, I suppose the stocks dropped today, “somehow” Obama’s fault too. A year and, some days into your fathers presidency -I’ll wait, Dip Shit junior
286 2018-02-05 23:29:53 My adviser wanted me to get into stocks last summer. I said that the recession is coming and eager to lose money. Economics degree helping me still.
287 2018-02-05 23:29:51 I was told by Democrats that the rise in the stocks were all because of Obama, not Tump, so I guess that is who we are supposed to blame.
288 2018-02-05 23:29:48 He knew stocks were overvalued back then, but he became such a cheerleader after becoming POTUS. His best hope is that general inflation makes everything else catch up before stocks crash.
289 2018-02-05 23:29:32 No decrease in my taxes but I did see quite a decrease in my stocks.  Thank you Cheeto man.
290 2018-02-05 23:29:30 Trying to find your Tweet about the failing Stock Market... #stocks #Stockstowatch #DowJones
291 2018-02-05 23:29:27 Monday's 1175 point (-4.6%) fall was the biggest drop seen in the Dow since 10 August 2011, 1632 trading days earlier, and was the biggest fall on a Monday in the 339 weeks since 8 August 2011 #stocks
292 2018-02-05 23:29:16 Btw, bump stocks give near auto fire capability to semi auto weapons, couple that with high capacity mags and you have what is essentially an assault rifle. That's why these accessories were made, to skirt laws.
293 2018-02-05 23:29:16 @realDonaldTrump takes credit when stocks go up, so he should also be at fault when it goes down. Let’s see if he’ll own up to it.#TrumpSlump #TrumpEconomy #StockMarketCrash
294 2018-02-05 23:29:12 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls @VP @seanhannity   We who love you Trump are very sick of waiting for a Dem arrest they are getting away with trying to bring down America now Dem billionaires are crashing the stocks time for jail Come on
295 2018-02-05 23:29:08 People also stock on margin . Meaning they borrowed money to play the market . Generally not a good idea . So when stocks went to down they had to sell to cover loss.  If anything it is on Congress because of budget deal or lack of one .
296 2018-02-05 23:28:52 Yeesh, the market is hurting this week. I’m pretty well diversified (stocks AND bonds, foreign & domestic) - everything is red. Time to sidestep for awhile.
297 2018-02-05 23:28:51 @jimcramer I think this is a little more than a correction. Idt people r smart by keep believing n stocks that have fallen $100. How much more blood should people give. I’m not willing 2 take a chance on another million.
298 2018-02-05 23:28:47 Stocks are overvalued. The PEs are way too high. A correction is way overdue even if everything else was stable..which it is not.
299 2018-02-05 23:28:46 Some basic numbers illustrate the rationale for the sharp loss in value in US stocks. Over the 4 years 2013 to 2017, the average blended forward PE valuation for the S&P 500 index was 16.1 times earnings. The avg.10-year bond yield over the same period was 2.17% @ricspooner_CMC
300 2018-02-05 23:28:39 *in old carney accent* STEP RIGHT UP AND GET YOUR STOCKS! No the DOW isn’t falling faster then a bowling ball out a plane that’s just fake new you see? Like the Wall Street journal, Washington Post, CNN, Fox, and the New York Times.
301 2018-02-05 23:28:36 @realDonaldTrump stocks are down. I bet it's @HillaryClinton fault. Or is it the @FBI ? Maybe the #DACA recipients? Or the MS-13? Please tell me who we blame for this. #StockMarket #DowJones #DumpTrump
302 2018-02-05 23:28:30 This may be just a correction in the market, but the selling in the last two days looked desperate, panicky even. I hope I'm wrong, but I think stocks will go lower before folks feel comfortable jumping back in.
303 2018-02-05 23:28:23 What's a good platform to trade stocks/shares on? Also for crypto?
304 2018-02-05 23:28:19 The market always makes adjustments. When it goes up 6000 points. Evidently you know nothing about stocks. I made 30% this last year. Explain that
305 2018-02-05 23:28:18 Stocks dropping like a rock but it is NOT my fault. 
@FoxNews HELP!!!!
Please explain how this is Obama's fault
306 2018-02-05 23:28:17 ننتظر ونشوفالفيوتشر الامريكي أخضر حالياً
وفوق حاجز ال 24000
ممكن يكون له تأثير إيجابي ولو طفيف إذا إستمر على هذا الحال حتى جلسة اليوم 
إن شاء الله
307 2018-02-05 23:28:12 But one thing goes with the other. If millionaires lose money on stocks, they'll not lower the quality of their lifestyle. They will lay off workers. I've seen it happen so many times in my dog life.
308 2018-02-05 23:28:06 And now my stocks are in the tank!
309 2018-02-05 23:28:05 By @foxandfriends rules; he shouldn’t be able to handle stocks because he is some how a political hack or somethin’ 
310 2018-02-05 23:28:00 waiting it out... it will all bounce back for the important stocks eCar !
311 2018-02-05 23:27:48 Ok first time stocks drop 1,500 points, this finna be a breeze.
312 2018-02-05 23:27:41 Because none of those peoples 401k’s are invested in stocks... 

Keep highlighting how out of touch the left has become
313 2018-02-05 23:27:41 30 on them glocks we don’t really do the stocks widdit, try and take my bitch, 3 strikes, you will not hit it
314 2018-02-05 23:27:37 And stocks are going down, down, down, down.....
315 2018-02-05 23:27:31 On #stocks: If in cash, sit back & watch the show. 

Never try to catch a falling knife.
316 2018-02-05 23:27:25 Remember, if you're not retiring anytime soon -- you should want the market to go down every day so you can buy high-quality stocks cheaper. #Markets
317 2018-02-05 23:27:20 Listened to many saying the middle class aren't hurt by this since they aren't in the market. But what about people with a 401k that have stocks?
318 2018-02-05 23:26:49 Pot stocks just a little green today no pun intended.  If the market goes up in a day or two could pot stocks now be a new harbinger?
319 2018-02-05 23:26:44 I hope traders sell, sell, sell, so I can buy, buy, buy #stocks
320 2018-02-05 23:26:41 Can you explain? At least stocks are ownership interests in profitable enterprises.
321 2018-02-05 23:26:26 When I mentioned the Market and Stocks are like a "Pig on LSD" you now know what I was Talking about. GLTFA
322 2018-02-05 23:26:19 Yes, as it always has. I have both stocks and cryptocurrencies and I never think about the prices. Buy and hold!
323 2018-02-05 23:26:18 Your words are divisive. We expect nothing less of  you, little man.  History won't be kind to you.  HOW ABOUT THOSE STOCKS!
324 2018-02-05 23:26:11 I wish I had money to buy stocks right now
325 2018-02-05 23:26:11 Nope, the stock market is unraveling because trump’s buddies got their tax cut. Now they’re selling off the overpriced stocks and screwing the retirees whose pension funds hold stock and middle clas who hold IRAs.
326 2018-02-05 23:26:11 Stocks go up and down. Look at it percentage wise. And take a deep breath.  Now may be a good time to buy!!!
327 2018-02-05 23:26:08 Post Publishing Buzz super rich men made the stocks go down to hurt Trump only public knows the super rich are causing the stock drop
328 2018-02-05 23:26:06 Stocks tanking and - even worse - Chelsea lose 4-1 to Watford.  Ugh.....  I hate Mondays.....except Eagles are Super Bowl winners for the first time, which dulls much of the pain.  What a game!!
329 2018-02-05 23:26:05 Why do stocks like Amazon and Google split so the average investors can invest
330 2018-02-05 23:25:35 So Trump took credit for the rise in stocks earlier in the year, I assume he will be taking credit for the fall today and the past week.
331 2018-02-05 23:25:30 How’s our stocks, LOL
332 2018-02-05 23:25:17 Conversation with Dad on the drive home from work: stocks and football @ShelleyJones8
333 2018-02-05 23:25:16 What say you about plummeting stocks
334 2018-02-05 23:25:09 Noway, I will just make more money. Keep the money in, buying at lower shares stock market will go back up it always does. Stocks are not for the commie liberals. Capitalism always prevails.
335 2018-02-05 23:25:04 Was most of it Deutsche Bank stocks when people realized the Trump loans are useless?
336 2018-02-05 23:24:40 My stocks are still up 30%
337 2018-02-05 23:24:38 Stocks down 4% as investors react to Patriots loss. That’s what caused the decline. Am I right?
338 2018-02-05 23:24:28 True stocks go down, but then they go back up again.  I think your headline is misleading. BTW you only “lost” money today if you sold. The stock market is like a roller coaster, you only get hurt if you jump off.
339 2018-02-05 23:24:21 I'm guessing you don't have any stocks, seeing you certainly don't understand the stock market
340 2018-02-05 23:24:20 I cringe when ppl talk about stock market & economy as if they are perfectly correlated, not what stocks are a measure of
341 2018-02-05 23:24:19 what happens to risk parity now? do they rebalance and shift to stocks?
342 2018-02-05 23:24:17 Stocks dropping a rock but it is NOT my fault. 
@FoxNews HELP!!!!
This is somehow the Dems fault. Fox news will explain later.
343 2018-02-05 23:24:16 Yes it is a great day to buy stocks given the Dow Jones drastic drop over last week.
344 2018-02-05 23:24:15 US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. However, the White House, responding to the market drop insisted on Monday night that long-term economic fundamentals “remain exceptionally strong”.
345 2018-02-05 23:24:06 Do you think bitcoin helped in absorbing the tumbling of stocks?
346 2018-02-05 23:24:03 What apple is a poor investment I am putting it all on buttcream stocks. Then invest in the actual product then when trump gets impeached I will sell it wholesale to all the butthurt trumpsters. I will make my own stocks rise to the sky!
347 2018-02-05 23:23:55 Damn all my stocks are down today...
348 2018-02-05 23:23:54 Any stocks green today? Tip my hat to whoever has one..
349 2018-02-05 23:23:19 As an investor in stocks myself (retirement accounts), the stock market's success directly affects me in a positive way.

This is true of all households with a retirement account.
350 2018-02-05 23:23:17 Managed to sell my most valuable stocks before the market tanked, thank God. Looking at how things are going I could've lost quite a bit
351 2018-02-05 23:23:02 You must hold on to your stocks until the 1% sells theirs. Then, after that, you can sell yours.
352 2018-02-05 23:23:01 Stocks down due to memo. 

You have very bright people who run the markets and those who invest. 

They seen the same memo and you dont need a degree to read between the lines.

The pot is boiling.
353 2018-02-05 23:22:57 I bet (I'm long banking and tech) that a large % of reason for decline today came from stop orders getting triggered that protected profit taking and some scared new investors getting out. Erasing a month of gains is nothing #Investors #stocks #StockMarket
354 2018-02-05 23:22:51 Paychecks going way up? You mean like $1.50 per week? Paul Ryan already threw dirt on that boast, dotard...by pointing out exactly how little average earners are gaining. Plus, you forgot to mention that stocks have fallen further than any other time in history.
355 2018-02-05 23:22:48 The real comfort is that your stocks went way down since last Thursday.
356 2018-02-05 23:22:43 Liberals are the stupidest living things on earth. Janet Yellen sabatoges the stock market on her way out. Calling stocks overvalued. Pissed she did not get 2nd term. Sabatoge  #StockMarket
357 2018-02-05 23:22:32 my stocks & crypto down today but I ain’t trippin 
358 2018-02-05 23:22:23 Im investing in all the new penny stocks now available after the #TrumpMarketCrash of 2/6/18
359 2018-02-05 23:22:19 Most stocks can be held all principle and earnings are treated as earned income when RRSP is cashed in
360 2018-02-05 23:22:10 No.
Stocks are a BUBBLE exactly repeating housing bubble pattern of soaring prices while incomes near flat and many nil-wage
361 2018-02-05 23:22:08 STOCKS:  You may want to watch economic reports, including those relating to foreign investment, the dollar versus euro/yen, interest rates, consumer confidence, oil and sales for signs of a slowing economy.

@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDemocrats
362 2018-02-05 23:21:59 I'm thinking the people of Fresno should put him in stocks in the middle of the city.
363 2018-02-05 23:21:51 Stocks plunge, we break it all down for you w/ @RiverFrontIG Chris Konstantinos @DavidInglesTV  now  on #DaybreakAsia Radio
364 2018-02-05 23:21:49 “Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices

This is HOW IT WORKS folks”
365 2018-02-05 23:21:41 She's right. Less than 50% own stocks. Fewer have 401k than you would think. And of that 50%, 37% or so is owned by the top 10%. So for most people, celebrating a stock rally is a non story. They're not benefiting. That's called research.
366 2018-02-05 23:21:27 Guess who is responsible for the stock market slide? Trump? Pah. It is I. I who avoided investing in the market until two weeks ago. Coincidence?  Oh no, I don’t think so. #stocks
367 2018-02-05 23:21:15 Shhh, his base might hear you. Plus, now I'm thinking he will say stocks tanked because of Puerto Rico OR Dems not agreeing to stop brown people from getting here.
368 2018-02-05 23:21:06 I'm a big fan of stocks
369 2018-02-05 23:21:01 Your 100% in stocks with money you were using a week out ? Definition of not smart
370 2018-02-05 23:21:00 Bruh all stocks are down... what’s causing this shift?
371 2018-02-05 23:20:56 No.
Stocks
372 2018-02-05 23:20:50 Stocks are on sale!!!
373 2018-02-05 23:20:39 Eagles win the superbowl and now stocks are down? Something's fishy

377 2018-02-05 23:20:10 we take wealth and we make heaven on earth a reality and an all night party next to pure blue waters... purified with a brita filter... we sponsors need sales zero sales money zero. sell stocks sell sell sell these kids are CLUELESS business and worldly inept.  Run SELL SELL.
378 2018-02-05 23:20:07 I'm a Joe the Jackhammer and I own stocks. But you are for the most part right, if the mostly left leaning colleges would teach more about stock, investment and money management that would not be the case.
379 2018-02-05 23:19:55 Yeah, stocks hate a raise in Intrest rates and one has happened recently. That's why they fell. Mine also took a hit.
380 2018-02-05 23:19:44 Yep the herd has panicked - quality stocks on sale :)
381 2018-02-05 23:19:24 It's like that in pinksheet stocks.  People always thinks it's some paid shill driving them and not because it's a dogshit scan company.  Money makes people like to themselves.
382 2018-02-05 23:19:21 ...because stocks tend to revert to their mean intrinsic value. 

Stocks were (and still are, even after the drop today) SIGNIFICANTLY OVERVALUED 

#DowJones #StockMarketCrash #Market 

This could be just the tip of the iceberg
383 2018-02-05 23:19:02 Making America great again.... US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February
384 2018-02-05 23:19:00 Stocks rise & fall. They're indicators of how people feel. If Trump always takes personal credit for the #StockMarket rise it makes sense he should get credit when it plunges. Right?

I'm no Lib, Dem or Rep. The only party I'd support is the George Carlin party.
385 2018-02-05 23:18:55 I think Howard on the news told us work is cancelled for Wednesday due to the weather. 6”-10” during the day? No thank you, y’all can trade your own stocks.
386 2018-02-05 23:18:54 I hope everyone has a fire sale on their stocks and buys bitcoin. Fuck the corporations. #StockMarketCrash
387 2018-02-05 23:18:44 ??? We have no idea what to do. Cannot hold metals..they'll come and get em.
We put all ours in simple cds! Not greedy,
Set, no real increase..just to be. Lost 60k
In stocks,,Harken energy cheated! David lost 50% in his cds, proceeds from home..,may lose it all now. Figures.
388 2018-02-05 23:18:43 so is this "mini crash" due in large part to the vol. etfs in combo with stocks being over extended? is there something bigger going on?
389 2018-02-05 23:18:38 The stocks were overvalued to begin with,  though.
390 2018-02-05 23:18:34 Stocks 2.81% today... That 401K portfolio is still27.4% since @POTUS took office!
391 2018-02-05 23:18:27 Will the news report markets simply gave back gains from January, or will they report blood on the streets, "the Dow down 1200 points!" & encourage viewers 2 question what 2 do w/ their RRSP contribution this year, the way they did early 2009? (when stocks were at their cheapest)
392 2018-02-05 23:18:12 If this is true, would you expect to see a trend towards index linked stock investments as the importance of holding particular stocks diminishes versus storing wealth in a relatively low risk and politically and economically stable market?
393 2018-02-05 23:18:07 You Trump morons aen't very bright. Go buy them stocks Barb 
394 2018-02-05 23:17:58 The #DowJones dipping 1,150 points is a #positive thing because it will shake out all of the "overvalued" stocks.

#Liberals are claiming that it's "Trump's fault" even though they said "#Trump has nothing to do with the "booming" #StockMarket" all last year.

#TrumpEffect #MAGA
395 2018-02-05 23:17:54 i don't have a boss

"weed stocks" are all the rage. now that we know more of the rules the possible valuations of companies becomes a bit more clear. 

being able to smoke in most places means more people under 35 will buy and smoke when out drinking & such. bullish
396 2018-02-05 23:17:44 Waot, I thought Dems were saying that Obama was responsible for how great our stocks are!!!!!
397 2018-02-05 23:17:40 Most Americans don’t even have money to “buy, buy, buy” stocks. Most are just trying to make it. Clearly you’re out of touch. Bye, bye, bye....
398 2018-02-05 23:17:32 Stocks 2.81% today... That 401K portfolio is still27.4% since @POTUS took office!
399 2018-02-05 23:17:28 Yep. We got some fun film stocks in from @lomography in addition to our regular Kodak, Ilford & Fuji stock. Carrying the new Polaroid stuff, and Instax stuff, too. #ShopLocal

401 2018-02-05 23:17:23 Obama's effects happened up till Trump's first year, then, all the  your fearless leader did, undid the good Obama did. But go ahead, buy up them stocks... But first pay off your house, when the Feds raise the rates, bend over 
402 2018-02-05 23:17:20 Thanks for the shitty drop in stocks. Now I really hate you. Messing with my money, sucka.
403 2018-02-05 23:17:16 fav thing is how obama citing the stocks so much during his final year was legit stupid, because it was so detached from suffering of regular citizens who own none, and was used as ammo by trump, who then did the same thing, and now the market just nosedived, so nothing matters
404 2018-02-05 23:17:05 Mr Trump the big rich and powerful bankers made the Stocks collapse is paybacks for releasing the Memo but don't give in to it @realDonaldTrump
405 2018-02-05 23:16:52 Aussie stocks open the Tuesday trade with big losses. S&P/ASX 200 down 2.6%

411 2018-02-05 23:15:59 Thank you, you moron, for sending stocks into a talispin worth your lunatic ravings Nunes, courage, hero? He's a classic villian.The guy is a  shifty liar a schill for the WH, who has no concept or appreciation 4 his role in Congress,as a separate branch of gov from the executive
412 2018-02-05 23:15:58 Thats why I don't rush anymore when I see more then 3 stocks

Fucken wake up level 3 supers lmfao.
413 2018-02-05 23:15:36 If some stocks go down then other stocks must go up -- this is known as the "zero sum law" of stocks. Therefore, if you invest in all stocks simultaneously, you will never lose money.
414 2018-02-05 23:15:33 Too busy selling his stocks this AM.
415 2018-02-05 23:15:32 Working people panic and take  retirement funds out of the markets and put their retirement funds in money markets making absolutely nothing as a return. The market will rebound, as it always has, and by selling your Stocks now, to 1% club can buy back stocks cheaper #Resist
416 2018-02-05 23:15:23  damn I lost a lot of $$ today... #dow #stocks
417 2018-02-05 23:15:03 Ultra rich investors were super excited their man was in. Stocks soared. Then earnings came in. Nothing to support the massive spike in stocks. So we are seeing a massive correction.
418 2018-02-05 23:14:56 Plus pulling in how one purchases stocks
419 2018-02-05 23:14:54 Give it a rest - you do realize what’s going on in the markets right now. Are you posting big shit heaps on all ASX and DOW stocks?
420 2018-02-05 23:14:48 And in the real real world I don't have stocks and this average worker is STILL better because of Trumps economy. So get your damn facts straight.  Travel a little and learn about us.
421 2018-02-05 23:14:46 The Dow Jones industrial average suffered its biggest one-day point drop in history, plunging 1,175 points on Monday and giving back all its 2018 gains as a flash-crash-style drop intensified a free fall in stocks that began last week.
422 2018-02-05 23:14:24 I didn't look.  Did it come all the way down to 24. People jumping out of windows.  
Or is it a selling off.   As in profit taking.    Wow how many will buy back stocks at cheaper price and make even more money
423 2018-02-05 23:14:22 Yeah. But if you have a 401k you own stocks.
424 2018-02-05 23:14:22 if you pay with crypto or stocks it comes out to about the same though
425 2018-02-05 23:14:16 "See? The Bitcoin bubble has burst! Told ya!"
*stocks plunge; worst day since 2008*
426 2018-02-05 23:14:10 What about my Stocks??? Can you explain??? Do you take credit for the market drop???
427 2018-02-05 23:14:09 @realDonaldTrump "US stocks took a further steep plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,179 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year." Gonna BRAG on THAT, jerk? #ThanksForNothingTrump
428 2018-02-05 23:13:45 What are your top 15 lessons to learn from the stock market today? #stocks #Stockstowatch #StockMarketCrash
429 2018-02-05 23:13:30 I still think we find a bottom before the week is out. I'm seeing support hold in multiple stocks. When I say support, I mean their lowest support of all time, but it still seems to be holding.
430 2018-02-05 23:13:24 It seems like suddenly the world is in love with fiat. Stocks down, Bitcoin down, bond yields down, gold and silver down, all on the same day.
431 2018-02-05 23:13:15 Trying to imagine what Trump will tweet today if he wasn’t the president.

The failing Trump admin is a mess.
Their policies are not working. 
Stocks are going down. Bad!
432 2018-02-05 23:13:08 Stocks plunging, cryptos plunging, good day to buy cheap!
433 2018-02-05 23:13:00 If you got into the market last year? Youre still up 19%. That's still a huge gain. Many of us took our winnings knowing a correction was coming. 
It's always a gamble, especially when you have overvalued stocks with high PEs
434 2018-02-05 23:12:53 Once again, #Trump “succeeds” BIGLY. Maybe it’s unfair to place blame for stocks on any president, but since Trump claimed the credit for the *entire* rise, he owns any falls.
435 2018-02-05 23:12:35 So, @realDonaldTrump tweeted in 2015 that if the DJI ever dropped more than 1k points, that the sitting president should be shot by cannon to the sun.

@elonmusk falcon heavy launch tomorrow... maybe the roadster has a seat for him? #stocks #SpaceX #FalconHeavy
436 2018-02-05 23:12:25 I guess the majority of his base doesn’t own any stocks, so for them it’s a “new win”...
437 2018-02-05 23:12:22 Are all Republicans this dense? Trump was the one that claimed the improvement in the economy was his doing. It wasn’t. So, based on Trump’s own ego, since he claims it is his doing when the stocks went up, it also must be his doing when it plummets. Same logic.  Right?
438 2018-02-05 23:12:18 HEY @realDonaldTrump why aren't we hearing a big announcement? HUGE drop in stocks - Where's the Tweet? #FatNixon
439 2018-02-05 23:12:15 セリクラ来たる？プールしておいた資金を出動させます。もしかしたら５年ほど前の値で買えるのではと期待。右肩上がりの銘柄にとっては最大のチャンスかもしれない！

440 2018-02-05 23:12:03 The financial markets are driven by fear and greed. STAY OUT OF BOTH. When investing, use logic and good common sense. Do not put money in stocks that you will need in the next 10 years. Keep at least 10K in cash for emergencies. Diversify across all asset classes.
441 2018-02-05 23:11:55 I am starting my first virtual trading of stocks و خلاص هعتبر نفسي wolf of ماسر مش wall street بس
442 2018-02-05 23:11:52 how much aum tied to short puts? have to sell stocks to cover. some liquidating going on
443 2018-02-05 23:11:52 Good opportunity to pick up some good stocks during this pull-back.  I know I did.
444 2018-02-05 23:11:47 OK so you got the 1% their tax cut. Now they are divesting of their stock profits, and diminishing values on stocks and bonds used in retirement accounts etc. Oh these people are slick and evil. People will panic. Drop even further then the 1% will swoop in and purchase.
445 2018-02-05 23:11:45 Personal opinion I don't think the market was supposed to go up that quickly. Granted some stocks are worth the price they are at now but some are overtly hyped up and got the burn.

449 2018-02-05 23:11:06 It's hilarious when people who know shit about stocks talk like the do
450 2018-02-05 23:10:58 The only thing Trump has done to "help" the DJIA is to promise to remove regulations keeping Americans financially safe and physically healthy. Which is great for a short-term boost. Long term, I suppose cancer-treatment facilities stocks will continue to rise...
451 2018-02-05 23:10:47 no question bitcoin has fueled semi stocks like nvda and amd.  reminds me of sun micro and emc back in 1999.  obviously apple phones being complete crap doesn't help semi's  -)

456 2018-02-05 23:10:18 The people who were buying stocks decided that things were worth 4% less than they were at the start of the day.

Odds are because they were never that valuable to begin with and the perceived value was inflated by historically low interest rates that will soon begin to increase.
457 2018-02-05 23:09:59 Remember those people who said b/c stocks weren't plummeting last November and again last January that actually he wouldn't be all that bad?

463 2018-02-05 23:09:20 thanks for the encouragement. because assisted care is not covered the stocks my step-dad left her was the cushion. That keeps getting smaller along with dividends. I was scared before today. I just wasn't talking about it.
464 2018-02-05 23:09:17 The 1% are currently buying stocks at low prices only to hold until their price goes up and sell high
465 2018-02-05 23:09:08 Stocks tank.  Lowest since 2008. YOUR FAULT!

481 2018-02-05 23:07:24 Forget about today’s market action , Trump should stop talking about stocks/401k. Only 40% of country have 401k’s, and many that do couldn’t afford to contribute in past couple of years
482 2018-02-05 23:07:12 Trump took credit for higher stocks, which was stupid
Liberals will blame Trump for lower stocks, which is stupid

We live in stupid times.
483 2018-02-05 23:07:02 I’m average. I’m investing.  Both through retirement accounts and a small ETF account. Pretty much most people with a job that isn’t unskilled, low-skill work has investment of this nature. I’m no rich person with millions in stocks.
484 2018-02-05 23:06:51 Good. Stocks are on sale. Buy low, sell high
485 2018-02-05 23:06:50 Don't be a hero and try to catch the falling knife. We don't know yet how short vol funds will settle, etc. Otherwise, I agree. Lots of great stocks now better priced, and not much really wrong w #MKT, but need to watch inflation, bond yields before getting too excited.
486 2018-02-05 23:06:46 News of the greatest scandal in American history by the Democratic Party isn’t helping the stock market is it? Stocks will rebound but the mafia style democrats won’t .
487 2018-02-05 23:06:45 Then Scandalous Fake FoxNews,  Why everyday 24/7 were you given him Credit when Stock Market was up? Notice Loud Mouth Trump have been Bragging About Stocks as Long as it was doing Good Now he quiet.
488 2018-02-05 23:06:43 Let me guess...now that stocks are falling it's Trump's stock market. As soon as it recovers it'll be Obama's again...correct?
489 2018-02-05 23:06:39 Stocks go up. Stocks go down. It's not all that surprising that it's dropped since it went up so quickly. It's probably just a slight correction, as long as people don't panic it won't crash. This is the nature of stocks.
490 2018-02-05 23:06:36 In the stock mkt, you buy low then sell high. Stocks will/can go down slightly or hugely dependent on how many others sell off. Then you buy back in at a lower price or find a better stock to buy in low at. Or you can do puts or calls if you think it's gonna drop or rise. Etc...
491 2018-02-05 23:06:33 You announce that your going to lower corporate taxes = better margins, stocks rise.  

People want to cash in on that rise, invest with liabilities with the hope to pay 0.1%-3% for a 10% gain.  #ItsJustEconomics
492 2018-02-05 23:06:26 Me, illiterate rube: "The stock market is bullshit. It's just made up numbers."

Fancy Economist: "Fool. The Dow crashed due to overvalued stocks leading to a market correction so technically yes."

504 2018-02-05 23:05:10 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
505 2018-02-05 23:05:08 But our stocks are going way down!
506 2018-02-05 23:05:01 Can I just say the Dow Jones is such a stupid index. I mean its price weighted and its industrial stocks.
Please people use a market cap weighted index. Like the S&P 500, Russell 1000 or even the Wilshire if you want to include small caps.
507 2018-02-05 23:05:01 Thats funny.  I also blame trump.  The excessive job growth and gdp performance has struck a fear of inflation in the heart of WallStreet.  Corrections are normal and we are in incredibly positive terrirtoy for stocks since he took ofc.
508 2018-02-05 23:04:51 If you're ready to retire and you still have your money in volatile stocks, you are doing something wrong.
509 2018-02-05 23:04:48 Agree.
Eccles will jump in to pump up stocks immediately & crush bonds.
Just the renewed communist US free market system.
510 2018-02-05 23:04:46 I’m not saying you’re wrong here, but at some point BTFD won’t work anymore and stocks will see huge losses again in the near future.  This short volatility massacre happening as we speak could very much exacerbate the issue.
511 2018-02-05 23:04:32 I am not saying that stocks won't fall 95% short term. I don't know. It's two different things for me. A short term blood bath versus stocks in general having a future. Both can happen imo
512 2018-02-05 23:04:28 Bet folks will start taking profits and dumping stocks @CNN
513 2018-02-05 23:04:26 The Market is still way overvalued & there will continue to be sell offs while investors realize the stocks don't have the inventories required to justify their wealth. Now is not the time to buy. Either sit still & ride this or sell out & get whatever profit you can
514 2018-02-05 23:04:24 I absolutely hate when this happens. I’ve taken to checking any cupboards that I can see. Most seem to keep their stocks in the loos..... worth a try?
515 2018-02-05 23:04:24 The stocks dropped cause the wages started going up rapidly, this is normals, and there already starting to recover
516 2018-02-05 23:04:24 Pretty sure “Joe-the-Jackhammer-Operator” and “Susie-Homemaker” don’t have stocks. That’s actually the true problem with Trump’s claims about the economy  in the real world, stocks mean nothing to the average worker... Trump doesn’t care about these workers either.
517 2018-02-05 23:04:23 @realDonaldTrump How many Trillions have you make us lose in the last week? #DowJones #FinancialMarkets #stocks
518 2018-02-05 23:04:16 Economics 101 reminder: The stock market is NOT the economy.

Stocks aren’t jobs. Stocks aren’t wages.

That’s why stock prices can go up and normal people still won’t feel any more secure about their future.

Recessions are when real GDP growth falls for 2 quarters in a row.
519 2018-02-05 23:04:13 Stocks fall on fear of wage growth despite large business tax cut. Hrm.
520 2018-02-05 23:04:10 Actually all the stocks I’m watching is dropping....might be a good time to buy. I will watch it for about a week
521 2018-02-05 23:04:10 It's a stock sell-off because higher interest rates make bonds less risky than stocks at this point.  This is how the market works.  You either know that and are intentionally scaring people or don't know that and should not speak out of ignorance.
522 2018-02-05 23:04:03 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell.
523 2018-02-05 23:03:55 Stocks are on sale!  What’s not to like ???

525 2018-02-05 23:03:44 Stocks markets continually rise as well as plunge. As far as I'm concern is much ado about nothing. @realDonaldTrump
526 2018-02-05 23:03:43 CNN has been MIA while stocks have soared, but suddenly you're reporting the market is down. Blaming President Trump I'm sure.
527 2018-02-05 23:03:40 Embarrassing?  Why because stocks are up 6000 points since he took office?  Funny how the liberal, biased media finally pays attention to the markets during a correction.
528 2018-02-05 23:03:30 The VIX, or the fear factor in Stocks, rises to 30.49 from 9 on January 5. The higher the number, the more fear in the equity markets.

530 2018-02-05 23:03:20 Dems are cheering that the stocks plummeted today.  Sad that they care more about politics than a growing economy.  BTW, it's a CORRECTION.  What goes up must come down.  #StockMarket #DowJones #MAGA
531 2018-02-05 23:03:18 Like I told The Onion, today's dip was due to New Englanders raising cash to pay their bookies.

532 2018-02-05 23:03:15 Oh good!  Thank goodness!  Something's got to compensate for the losses she's taking right now on her stocks!
533 2018-02-05 23:03:12 Talk me pres...tell me not to worry about my stocks@realDonaldTrump
534 2018-02-05 23:03:11 The reason Trump didn’t tweet much 5-6 days ago was because he was busy dumping all his stocks
535 2018-02-05 23:03:08 Your one f’n idiot, stocks down over 1100 points in one day!
536 2018-02-05 23:03:05 Any commentary on the Dow Jones Industrial Average should have a disclaimer that the DJIA is a non-representative sample of stocks divided by a made-up number.
537 2018-02-05 23:03:05 The market was less than half back then.  The percentage is not significant.  The market grew over 6,000 in a year.  Stocks are sold off because of that growth. Higher interest rates result in higher bond yields. It is normal, it's not even in the TOP 10 of single day Dow losses.
538 2018-02-05 23:03:00 The stock market dropping because all the people who bet on Patriots are selling their stocks to pay off their debts
539 2018-02-05 23:02:56 Stocks going down is BIG news! Stocks going up is NO news!
540 2018-02-05 23:02:48 It was less then 20 a year ago.  Stocks go up and down.  Always have.  If you do not sell you do not lose anything.
541 2018-02-05 23:02:48 just read your previous tweets. Time for the stocks to return to their fair value 
542 2018-02-05 23:02:48 Boy those stocks sure did some things that stocks do today wow
543 2018-02-05 23:02:46 Breaking-All of the kingpins of Hillary's Pizzeria child sex-shop are cashing in their stocks and purchasing bonds-so the Dow drop is her fault
544 2018-02-05 23:02:40 2:08 pm UNH @ $221.76, 2:09 UNH @ $215, 2:10 UNH @ $208.48 by 2:19 back at $225. If you think this is the way capital markets should function you should not be taken seriously. Same illegitimate activity in 100's of stocks.
545 2018-02-05 23:02:38 So now stocks don’t matter, right Junior?
546 2018-02-05 23:02:08 The stock market is not the economy. #markets #stocks
547 2018-02-05 23:01:59 Remarkable: DOW plunges today and not a peep out of @realDonaldTrump. I thought he was singlehandedly responsible 4 all thing stocks #goof
548 2018-02-05 23:01:58 Are you talking about the FUD about denying credit cards? You can't buy stocks with credit cards (in most cases) nor can you max out your credit card at a casino.
549 2018-02-05 23:01:58 You can acknowledge that the stock market had been on an upward trajectory and also that it’s on Trump’s watch now. But also, the president probably has less to do with stocks, other than psychologically, than most people think.
550 2018-02-05 23:01:58 Retweeted Max Keiser (@maxkeiser):

A 50% crash in stocks would be perfect timing. Anything $USD based is a Ponzi and deserves to die.
551 2018-02-05 23:01:57 UNLESS you have a mortgage, car loan, credit card debt, and you care about actually paying for your own healthcare, then you wont really have much extra to buy stocks, UNLESS you are in a rich family who deals with your finances with numerous bankruptcies.
552 2018-02-05 23:01:50 Stocks are tumbling because how do you think all of the tax reform is going to be paid for? The deficit is rising faster then the GOP  thought it would. Obama inherited an economy crashed by the greed of the banks. Once again a great stock market doesn't equate to a good economy.
553 2018-02-05 23:01:43 I was warching Ali and learned much. I learned on a bi wkly bases for 3 plus yrs about stocks and so glad I did. I even joined a stock club and purchased some. It is handled by a prof who knows his stuff. Thanks you guys
554 2018-02-05 23:01:31 stocks =/= economy
555 2018-02-05 23:01:29 while stocks collapse
556 2018-02-05 23:01:10 @langeamyFOX2 He took credit when stocks gained (what a joke!), think he’ll take responsibility for today’s biggest drop in history? He’s always bragging about being biggest & greatest ever this & that!      Riiiiiiiiggght!!!! #SpeakTruthToPower #NotMyPresident #TrumpStockCrash
557 2018-02-05 23:01:07 Stocks went down big time. #SpecialReport
558 2018-02-05 23:01:04 I’m holding 54,000 shares short GE at $20.18. I don’t trade stocks often but saw that blood bath coming.
559 2018-02-05 23:00:55 Today's the kinda day im glad that I'm too broke to own stocks
560 2018-02-05 23:00:51 I agree. Stocks are a necessary part of capitalism, state or no state. Crypto finance for trading stocks is going to replace fiat finance
561 2018-02-05 23:00:28 I have a friend that used to brag about how he unloaded all his stocks before the 2007 crash.  I didn’t sell anything.  I’m retired for 4 years, he’s still working.
562 2018-02-05 23:00:06 James Comey pulled a big lever that says “STOCKS DOWN”
563 2018-02-05 23:00:05 I'm not rich, but I do invest in stocks.

I'm not rich, but I do save for my retirement.

I know that doesn't make me the majority, but today did sucked for me.

I resent the notion that this only impacts billionaires. It's also, categorically speaking -- a really wrong take.
564 2018-02-05 23:00:01 Paul Samuelson famously said, "The market has predicted nine of the last five recessions." Think of this downturn as an opportunity. You can bargain shop for stocks on your watch list or you can run over to Trump's twitter feed and bust his balls about the Dow....
565 2018-02-05 23:00:01 Tax cuts have been priced in, now the down sides of Trump derived volatility will finally shock the market. The rise wasn’t all his fault and either will the crash, but this is why intelligent people don’t make uncontrollable metrics like stocks a yardstick for their success
566 2018-02-05 22:59:56 You’re suddenly an expert on the economy? I thought you were an alcoholic who begged for money on the internet? Suppose you live and learn. What stocks do you own btw ?
567 2018-02-05 22:59:46 Right. Now Ho back and look at the ratio of cash to stocks. And tell me we shouldn’t expect a 95% drop in the latter.
568 2018-02-05 22:59:44 I’m no genius but it stands 2reason that when the #Libs found the memo was 2b released of course they cashed in their stocks so they could topple market & head for the border. Why else would the market drop 666 pts the sign of the Antichrist aka #DemocRats #TheyHateThisCountry
569 2018-02-05 22:59:43 Yes, this is not the time to sell, if you feel confident in what you have.  If your stocks were good yesterday, they’re probably still good today. However, now may be a time to buy something that you thought was too pricy before - think of it as a sale.  Cheers.
570 2018-02-05 22:59:36 Cloudy, with a chance of depressed stocks.
571 2018-02-05 22:59:27 Sales on stocks! Yes! @mrmoneymustache
572 2018-02-05 22:59:24 Wht fundamentals Sara? U mean supply, demand, financing, interest rates, populations, demographics, labor force, labor rates, managemt, skills, training, materials, research & development, competition?  All those factors that give or take value to or from Corp stocks, dividends.
573 2018-02-05 22:59:06 One of the few wisemen I met in the market once told me:

“Buy the strongest stocks in a market meltdown, not the ones that  dcclined the most” 

Smart money (not necessarily all tutes) uses the former approach whereas the dumb money (not necessarily all retail) used the latter.
574 2018-02-05 22:59:02 I’m short stocks, crypto, fiat and even gold. I’m long baked beans. Got my tin foil hat and I’m going underground. Enjoy the summmer.
575 2018-02-05 22:58:59 Better start pulling your stocks 
576 2018-02-05 22:58:44 Price is the market's perception of value. Yes, relative value of stocks compared bonds should decrease when interest rates (bond yields) increase, but I'm saying that HFTs amplify the resulting price changes. #volatility
577 2018-02-05 22:58:42 And yet, no presidential tweets regarding the nose dive in stocks, which triggered all the sales of my current portfolio. Time to find a new reinvestment. perhaps war related dfense stocks.... Isn't that what's next to boost his terrible aproval ratings?
578 2018-02-05 22:58:35 Buy gas stocks! Lol
579 2018-02-05 22:58:34 How's obsmas stocks doing now?
580 2018-02-05 22:58:33 @Tony_BATtista that's a LOT of money that left the US almost overnight (USD + Stocks). Some big players seem pretty worried that shit will hit the fan.
581 2018-02-05 22:58:22 I had twitted that trump was manipulating the stocks to get millionaires billionaires to invest in this country. At one point I even thought he was going to give investors land to construct the companies. Nothing lasts forever.
582 2018-02-05 22:58:18 I got my raise!  My stocks did good today as well.  Thank you kind Sir
583 2018-02-05 22:58:13 OR...........there are a lot of people who decided to cash in their stocks ands people buying them are waiting for the right price before scooping those stocks up at a price they like
584 2018-02-05 22:58:13 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr POTUS, I am depressed & panicked. My stocks have been decimated the last few days costing me 1000s of $$. Please work ur magic & make the markets go back up. Maybe some more top1% tax cuts or deport more illegal children? Thanks & MAGA. A true believer.
585 2018-02-05 22:58:08 Stocks cash flow, so does real estate, so does licensing... bitcoin is junk.
586 2018-02-05 22:58:06 The stock market looks bad now but remember the west coast stocks haven't closed yet. #StockMarketCrash
587 2018-02-05 22:58:05 @POTUS How about those stocks??
588 2018-02-05 22:58:03 we cannot afford stocks and rent and utilities/heat anymore
589 2018-02-05 22:57:55 I guess banks that short stocks should run false flags more often
590 2018-02-05 22:57:54 Hey @realDonaldTrump,how about them stocks, eh?? I think the market is finally seeing through your bullshit!!
591 2018-02-05 22:57:54 oops. seems people selling stocks won bigly. the rich get richer..... again
592 2018-02-05 22:57:54 Stocks are on sale today.
593 2018-02-05 22:57:38 Speaking off stocks how’s the market today
594 2018-02-05 22:57:29 Why didn't Obama just wave his hand & make I'd sky rocket 4 ever? Oh Yeah that's right, a pres has no control over the stocks. He can only create the atmosphere to grow the economy. Trump did just that.  But it's up 2 the market to flourish.
595 2018-02-05 22:57:29 This is what happens when we start stranding real stocks on STOCKX.
596 2018-02-05 22:57:28 Breaking (5:57 PM EST): Stocks making the biggest moves after hours: LULU, CRUS & SWKS... -- CNBC
597 2018-02-05 22:57:25 People freaking out about today's drop in the Dow Jones know nothing  about stocks. Yes, in points it's the biggest drop ever, but what's important in financial matters is percentages - and in that regard today's 4.6% drop is not even in the 250 worst days ever...
598 2018-02-05 22:57:21 Thanks to Nunes everyone just lost way more in stocks than they got from taxcut smh
599 2018-02-05 22:57:20 Funny how I have heard EVERY network and CNN talk about the Stocks gains..
600 2018-02-05 22:57:14 So when you claim stocks rose because of you, you get to own when they fall too.










#StockMarketCrash
601 2018-02-05 22:57:14 Every stock I have is down today. 90% of the stocks on my watch list are down too, also crypto currency is down hardcore too. Terrible! #StockMarket #bitcoin
602 2018-02-05 22:57:07 Oh, and I just lost a shit load in stocks!!  A shitload!!
603 2018-02-05 22:57:07 Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics. #StockMarket
604 2018-02-05 22:57:03 No Obama doesn't get much credit for that. it was going to happen either way. markets crashed and that means stocks are low and it's the best time to invest again causing the markets to rise again.
605 2018-02-05 22:56:57 Today's intense selling action wasn't all Joe-the-Jackhammer-Operator and Susie-Homemaker suddenly deciding the Trump economy sucks.  

It was largely computers programmed to dump stocks at certain levels.
606 2018-02-05 22:56:47 Don't worry,start BUYING dividend stocks now, they are at a discount,  blue light special.
607 2018-02-05 22:56:39 Which will continue to purchase fund stocks at reduced values and grow accordingly over time. The value only matters when you are cashing out...which, yeah, I hear you.
608 2018-02-05 22:56:38 I sense it may be more complicated, though am no economist. But it is possible that stocks ran up on because the market saw Trump as favoring business, and are now going down because they sense political instability. That could be on top of the usual pattern of rise/correction.
609 2018-02-05 22:56:35 If you like your stocks, you can keep your stocks.
610 2018-02-05 22:56:32 Having my retirement accounts invest in stocks is the financial equivalent of Groundhog's Day. Stocks lose over 1,000 points. That means six more years of working! #DowJones
611 2018-02-05 22:56:31 Stocks are on sale this week. 
Major companies available. 
Contact your broker.

612 2018-02-05 22:56:31 You need to seriously look around that sad and unfortunate terrorist in Las Vegas couldn't get a machine gun that's why he use BUMP stocks
613 2018-02-05 22:56:23 People selling those big pharma stocks before Trump makes prescription drugs more affordable.
614 2018-02-05 22:56:18 Stocks will open tomorrow:
615 2018-02-05 22:56:16 no one cares anymore.  Stocks will soon be $0.  LOL
616 2018-02-05 22:56:08 Damn glad I ain’t got any stocks today talking about the bottom falling out!!!
617 2018-02-05 22:56:07 "the dems are pulling all their stocks, I don't know, but that's what i hear!!"hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
618 2018-02-05 22:56:03 how about facing reality ONCE? Trump cut regulations, stocks went up. Interest rates went up as they were going to, stocks flop. Not to mention Wall St cannot look away from the reality that Trump is a lunatic and they are dont care about the trump cult, they want to make $
619 2018-02-05 22:55:56 The drop was the 33rd largest percentage wise.  Trees do not grow to the sky, stocks do not always rise.  This drop brings markets & many stocks to 2-3 year trendlines.
620 2018-02-05 22:55:54 Stocks in general are red everywhere today. 
621 2018-02-05 22:55:36 @TraderStef I'm sitting in all cash. Any recommendations on stocks to buy on a huge down day tomorrow?
622 2018-02-05 22:55:23 For all those who dumped their common & preferred stocks, I thank you. It allows me to buy,buy,buy,my dividend producing stocks at a five finger discount. Can you continue for a couple more days.
623 2018-02-05 22:55:20 Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trumponomics.
624 2018-02-05 22:55:01 Trumpers checking in to see what’s going on with their MAGA stocks made Dow Joans happen
625 2018-02-05 22:54:45 THE STOCKS ARE DOWN PEOPLE LOSING JOBS< AND MOST of you got millions of dollar breaks- Pennies to the poor and Millions for the RICH sounds like we are in RUSSIA
626 2018-02-05 22:54:44 no, this is corporate tax cut money buying back shares below market value. it’s a loss for ordinary traders, the stocks are now off the market. shareholders took the profit and left everyone else with a thousand yard stare. this will happen again in early april(end of quarter)
627 2018-02-05 22:54:41 HOW YA STOCKS NOW??
628 2018-02-05 22:54:22 Is M’lania dumping her stocks???! X
629 2018-02-05 22:54:09 cryptos down, stocks down, looks like im gonna have to get  a job
630 2018-02-05 22:54:07 Stocks tumble with the DOW hitting a 1,600pt low at one point setting the biggest intraday drop in history.
631 2018-02-05 22:54:07 @realDonaldTrump The Dow Jones Industrial Average just experienced an historic single-day decline, and other stock markets dropped as well, leaving tech stocks reeling.

The Dow Jones dropped 1,175 points Monday, after declining 666 points Friday.
632 2018-02-05 22:54:05 Exacerbated by risk parity funds that mechanistically rebalance as volatility moves, driving stocks lower and thus volatility higher in a feedback loop.
633 2018-02-05 22:53:50 Agree that stocks are likely to plummet short term. But in a post fiat world then if no one wants to invest in companies to build necessities then profit from same will rise. So it will balance out. You might get 3% by holding Bitcoin but 10% holding stocks w/BTC yield
634 2018-02-05 22:53:42 Just a pause.

Next, Sale on stocks!
635 2018-02-05 22:53:38 FACT: I have $100,000 in the stock market. All my stocks combined are worth $26,783 but I didn't sell any so I still have the $100,000 in the market.
636 2018-02-05 22:53:33 Maybe we can get back to the price of the stock reflects the real value of the corporation instead of the corporation ‘s value being based on the stocks price
637 2018-02-05 22:53:29 Shid i need to purchase one of them stocks today.
638 2018-02-05 22:53:26 Bet corp r glad. They'll b able to buy back their stocks cheaper w thier huge tax cut.
639 2018-02-05 22:53:23 Jurrien, if a portfolio is generally balanced between stocks and bonds...is decrease in stocks generally offset by increase in bonds value? For short term at least?
640 2018-02-05 22:53:21 Worth noting #GLEN managed a small gain today - few Stocks managed that particular trick.
641 2018-02-05 22:53:11 All they are is having a sale.  The stocks that were too pricey to buy before are now being priced right for me to buy them.
642 2018-02-05 22:53:11 Not just didn't lose, but stocks are on sale. This is buying day.
643 2018-02-05 22:53:10 Yo what’s up? Lol not stocks.
644 2018-02-05 22:53:00 @realDonaldTrump It was the scariest day on Wall Street in years.

Stocks went into free-fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
645 2018-02-05 22:52:53 A bit more there than that. Rates simply rise with inflation and inflation simply rises with a strong economy and Americans prosper in a strong economy . And stocks PERFORM BETTER THAN BONDS in a rising rate environment . Fed mitigates stafglation. All is normal and well .
646 2018-02-05 22:52:53 Stocks are on sale; good time to buy.
647 2018-02-05 22:52:46 It was the scariest day on Wall Street in years.

 it was alarming.
648 2018-02-05 22:52:41 Your tax scam made the stocks drop
649 2018-02-05 22:52:36 @realDonaldTrump , you're joking right?  He hasnt exposed one thing.  Oh! look at those stocks!
650 2018-02-05 22:52:24 Of great comfort to those who saw their actual stocks plummet.
651 2018-02-05 22:52:23 It was the scariest day on Wall Street in years.

652 2018-02-05 22:52:14 He sold his stocks last week. 
653 2018-02-05 22:52:05 And stocks were at their lowest in years on Friday.  You can't sweep that under the rug. Of course, I doubt if your supporters follow the stock market so they still think all us rosey.
654 2018-02-05 22:51:57 How are your stocks of broken down hacks?
655 2018-02-05 22:51:55 Waiting for all these stocks I been watching to hit rock bottom so I can finally afford to buy them 
656 2018-02-05 22:51:43 lol yeah but at least with stocks there’s a regulatory body. That puts me at ease.
657 2018-02-05 22:51:42 The Dow Jones Industrial Average just experienced the worst single-day decline in its history, and other stock markets dropped as well, leaving tech stocks reeling.

662 2018-02-05 22:50:51 Kind of happy I sold 100% out of my stocks last week tbh
663 2018-02-05 22:50:46 Lol @US stocks today
664 2018-02-05 22:50:46 I've already lost more money in stocks this week than I did in 2008 despite having a smaller percentage of my portfolio in stocks now than then. I blame @PhysicianOnFIRE . I hope he rots on that beach in Hawaii.
665 2018-02-05 22:50:20 Don't have any stocks, bonds, cds or apples. #poor
666 2018-02-05 22:50:16 good luck. I dont venture in futures. BUt, i picked my stocks and i made a little money... 

667 2018-02-05 22:50:15 Hearing reports that Mr. jones is selling all of his stocks in the market
668 2018-02-05 22:49:33 The sell off has nothing to do with policy or fundementals. QE forced money into stocks under Obama, as savings and bond rates were decimated. This rally is based on solid economic policy.
669 2018-02-05 22:49:29 Genius NOT, your primitive take on economy, stocks are tanking, dollar has been on 1 year global decline, BRACE urself for inflation growing faster than ur waistline
670 2018-02-05 22:49:24 His supporters don’t all have stocks but their 401KKK is doin’ great ;-)
671 2018-02-05 22:49:24 Thanks, John. There is also the problem the gov defines saving in a way I don't think most people would recognize or think is accurate. E.g., suppose that you take a % of your salary each month and buy stocks? Gov doesn't view that as savings. The net worth of ur home not savings
672 2018-02-05 22:49:09 With 4 trillion overseas cash, see how much stock buy back happens and how fast the markets go back up. Right now stocks lost two months gains, no worries still up 30% since Obama left town.
673 2018-02-05 22:49:09 New to this.  I'll trade anything, stocks funds whatever's out there.
674 2018-02-05 22:49:01 Hasnt DOW been dropping some since Amazon and others announced take on insurance companies making their stocks suddenly less appealing since they usually crush competition?
675 2018-02-05 22:48:48 me, genius level economist: your stock losses aren’t real until you sell. you idiot morons. stop panicking

also me: but then earnings from stocks aren’t “real” until you sell either

also me: crap ur right hang on, how is all his supposed to work? It’s imaginary?
676 2018-02-05 22:48:44 Dow Jones is tanking...my stocks are tanking right there with it...
677 2018-02-05 22:48:41 Time to buy STOCKS  now that their low, dont wait till their way up again, make those bucks while you can, cause they'll go up.
678 2018-02-05 22:48:31 So if I have money in stocks that haven’t done anything in years, basically money to lose, should I just gamble some of that shit on getting Bitcoin?
679 2018-02-05 22:48:27 True for me. Net less than 30k can't afford to mess with stocks oh an fun fact, they don't teach (didn't in my day anyway) how to play the market anyway. That's reserved for more affluent families, passed down. We regular Joe's are passed down work ethic
680 2018-02-05 22:48:16 @timseymour you shoudlnt be handlin money or trading, you LOSE peoples money and give people VERY BAD ENTRY POINTS ON STOCKS! of late WHERE is BREAKOUT $baba you said that night at 193??????? really are you normal??!
681 2018-02-05 22:48:06 1800 drop in stocks tell us shareholders thing repulik-cons are all treasonus assholes
682 2018-02-05 22:48:02 When stocks fall under a Democrat they're "down". When they fall under a Republican it's a "correction".
#TiredOfWinning
683 2018-02-05 22:47:55 Stocks went into free fall Monday! Before the closing bell the DOW plunged almost 16-hundred points. It is the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
684 2018-02-05 22:47:54 Dow plunges over 1100 points. Where you at #POTUS ? Is this true or #FakeNews ? @realDonaldTrump #DowJones #Dow #stocks
685 2018-02-05 22:47:53 Where is all the stock market money going? Stocks down, gold and silver stable, crypto down, dollar down. Bonds? I'm not the most financially literate person, but it seems odd.
686 2018-02-05 22:47:40 You just happened to sell all of your stocks the as they were riding huge highs the trading day before it tanked?? No shit?! LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL. Get the fuck out of here.
687 2018-02-05 22:47:34 #RIP to my portfolio both in #crypto and #stocks.
688 2018-02-05 22:47:31 Low Wages High Interest Rates Middle Class Deep In Dept Over Priced Stocks Layoffs GOP POTUS & Congress. That was Oct 1929!
689 2018-02-05 22:47:29 Causality is a hard thing to even demonstrate, let alone prove, ... but
Once there is fear, there is a a lot of history to expect the fear to feed on itself. This can happen until stocks are downright cheap. In this market, that could be quite a way. Look back to Oct 87.
690 2018-02-05 22:47:26 If you could get 2-4% returns per year, in cash, the least risky investment available, and you were not indoctrinated into believing investing in things where you have no specialty is wise, wouldn’t you just stick to medicine or plumbing or code?

I’m definitely short on stocks.
691 2018-02-05 22:47:21 "If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected," Trump tweeted in late December, "your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day." #StockMarketCrash
692 2018-02-05 22:47:19 Romeo and Juliet

OH DONNIE DONNIE--- WHERE ART THOU,  WHERE ART THOU,-----the stocks are falling like rain--
693 2018-02-05 22:47:19 kinda like the biggest drop in years in stocks? lol
694 2018-02-05 22:47:03 #breakingnews
Stocks go up. (Obama's economy)
Stocks go down (Trumps fault)
695 2018-02-05 22:47:00 Most corporations are buying back stocks and supporting their investors. When you think that 70% of Americans don’t have $1000 in savings and less than 10% of Americans own stock, there’s nothing for them coming out of #GOPTaxScam.
696 2018-02-05 22:46:57 @realDonaldTrump Biggest drop of stocks EVER #Trumpstockdrop #shitholepresident #shitholeGOP
697 2018-02-05 22:46:50 and stocks just had the largest point decline in history.
698 2018-02-05 22:46:49 Fox has the same morons on they had on Friday saying this is a "buying opportunity." They have no clue about the dislocations that could occur given the QE dynamics of this market...when your stocks bust their 20-demas, that's where you sell, as Gilmo always advises...
699 2018-02-05 22:46:42 After giving corporations 1.8 trillion in fun money stocks are diving globally After 1year of selling shares at all time high U.S. GDP hanging around 2.5? I smell a ROBBERY. 
700 2018-02-05 22:46:41 They will make money, when market tanks, people loose / but all those who received their billions in tax credit will start buying all those stocks cheaper, they never loose
701 2018-02-05 22:46:35 As Trump always brags that his policies are solely responsible for health of the stock market, I look forward to hearing why the Dow just dropped 1,179 points, largest fall on record. Stocks have lost $1tn in 5 days! Is it because those treasonous Dems didn’t clap at the #SOTU?
702 2018-02-05 22:46:31 $SPY down 1.1% ah. They trading on own. Multiple level derivatives. Mind of own. Nothing to to with real underlying stocks. Good riddance $XIV $SVXY.
703 2018-02-05 22:46:25 Fox headline “President Trump is creating stock buying opportunity for regular Americans by making stocks affordable for them! MAGA “
704 2018-02-05 22:46:24 Stocks down 1000 jackass!
705 2018-02-05 22:46:21 The fact you feel the need to make this statement forces me to remind you only 43% of Americans even own stocks.
706 2018-02-05 22:46:18 Now Trump says he won't sign any budget resolution ever (or until the border wall is funded). By coincidence, stocks are down sharply.
707 2018-02-05 22:46:03 Right after he broke the 25k mark. If you were smart, you would stop being anti Trump everywhere you go and buy stocks whole they're low and wait for it to go back up.
708 2018-02-05 22:46:03 Amazon is cool but focus on the financial sector stocks
709 2018-02-05 22:45:58 tbf, Trump did warn us there was a bubble. Then heroically didn't try and deflect blame when stocks continued to climb. Now we should be thanking because he's probably going to fix it.
710 2018-02-05 22:45:57 Well it is not the dollar collapsing it is the stocks, meaning the companies and Industry, not the currency. If you look at Venezuale were the currency itself that has collapsed, their is great desire for cryptocurrency there, they just don't have much volume to move the market.
711 2018-02-05 22:45:50 Well #dotardTrump stocks fell over 1600 points in 2 days of trading was that your fault or the Dems. IMO you with not replacing Yellen chairmen of the Federal Reserve. Interest rates will climb and the American dream is further not reachable.
712 2018-02-05 22:45:36 Your ignorance is showing, this correction doesn’t have anything to do with the strength of the economy..in fact the economy has done so well, wages have increased some much that the fear of interest hikes and inflation down the road have spooked stocks, #Dullard
713 2018-02-05 22:45:30 Short #stocks 
Long #bitcoin 
714 2018-02-05 22:45:27 You really need 2 do your own research because this is all a gamble at the end of the day. You can lose if you don't know what you're doing. If you follow my Twitter, I post stocks that I am looking at buying into. From there the decision will be yours when or if 2 enter the play
715 2018-02-05 22:45:09 And then? What does this mean for stocks?
716 2018-02-05 22:45:08 Listening to CNN chatter about the market drop blaming future interest rates, ignoring that the corporations are just getting ready to cash in by buying back their own stocks Big benefit from the tax cuts, these rich dudes now get from last months tax cut. Wealth redistribution
717 2018-02-05 22:45:08 European stocks fell sharply on Monday, tracking a global sell-off in equities. @Porsche slumped 2.4% after the auto maker said it planned to double its investment in hybrid and fully electric vehicles by 2022
718 2018-02-05 22:45:02 "InBev, Altria stocks rise on ｃｈｏｏｓｉｎｇａｓｗｉｆｔｄｅａｔｈ, pushing the market higher to close the week"
719 2018-02-05 22:45:01 They got everyone to sign up and now they will take their money. Good things majority of workers can't afford stocks.
720 2018-02-05 22:44:58 As US stocks plummet, Trump goes silent on role in markets 
CLICK BELOW FOR FULL STORY.....
721 2018-02-05 22:44:51 Do you Russians buy American stocks?
722 2018-02-05 22:44:49 The Crooked and Treasonous Democrats are dumping their stocks to cash in so as to RUN. Hillary, Strzok, Page, McCabe, and others might want to kiss their kids goodbye because Treason still carries the Death Penalty.
723 2018-02-05 22:44:39 Could the drop be from a few rich liberals cashing in and then rebuying at a lower price? Btw, even with a large drop, stocks would still be at one of the record plateaus of all time.  When did it go up at all under BO?
724 2018-02-05 22:44:34 Not true, Chris. They actively turned a blind eye to Big Pharm.  Gotta make sure those stocks go up!
725 2018-02-05 22:44:30 Honey, the only stocks *I’ll* be investing in are stock photos of exasperated bankers in front of computers

Please clap
726 2018-02-05 22:44:29 Ur not paying attention! Go look at who sold stocks today & how much they sold! Follow the selloffs!
It's called a planned attack!
727 2018-02-05 22:44:25 I am getting so sweaty over the plummeting stock market... my stocks are crying.
728 2018-02-05 22:44:22 gold supply goes down when people buy up existing supply - price goes up
stock sell off and convert to gold
prices of stocks go down gold price goes up
729 2018-02-05 22:44:21 It's not a great day to own cryptocurrency or stocks...
730 2018-02-05 22:44:19 What is a stock market. Are stocks in season this year, and can they be roasted with some whole garlic in the oven.
731 2018-02-05 22:44:10 While liberals moan about how terrible the market is, smart republicans will wait for the bottom and look at this as a buying opportunity for the stocks they missed.
732 2018-02-05 22:43:57 Well said, Liz.  It’s interesting how much one’s portfolio performance improves if there is cash available to buy when stocks drop.
733 2018-02-05 22:43:56 Fine but look at the stock market.  You said you were the reason why my stocks went up and now they are tanking.  It’s your fault...fix it please
734 2018-02-05 22:43:54 Bitcoin, Studebaker, or Haitian penny stocks... Where would you put your money?
735 2018-02-05 22:43:46 stocks bullish
736 2018-02-05 22:43:41 @realDonaldTrump Dow plunges 1,175 points in worst day for stocks since 2011 - Thanks Trump. If you want to claim the ups, you own the downs
737 2018-02-05 22:43:30 I sold all of my stocks last Wednesday 
738 2018-02-05 22:43:29 Jim I've been net short market 4 the past 4 months & some specific stocks. It's been painful but just like gradually buying when prices are crazy low, I've been gradually shorting at what I think are silly index levels. Was massive net long in Feb 16 & July 16 esp.banks. 1/2
739 2018-02-05 22:43:24 US stocks dived on Monday, as a sell-off in global markets deepened amid fears that rising inflation would force central banks to raise interest rates.
740 2018-02-05 22:43:20 Worse, is you should see my bitcoin stocks today :'(
741 2018-02-05 22:43:00 Algorithms triggered massive sell-off today turning into what is called a "Flash Crash." Humans did not control today's market sorry to say. #Stocks
742 2018-02-05 22:42:58 Not the best point to make.  The stock market tanking is bad for business, which is bad for everyone, regardless of how many people own stocks.  Also, people's 401ks
743 2018-02-05 22:42:51 Well I almost sold most of my stocks Friday. Probably should have got too hot too fast.
744 2018-02-05 22:42:47 Yeah they want the stock market high so our 401ks buy inflated overpriced stocks and when it's time for us to try to live off those stocks they're deflated and not worth shit. Took away pensions so the corporations wouldn't have to take the risk. Shifted all that to the workers
745 2018-02-05 22:42:46 @Ingrid39678584 You are a fool. Stocks were dn. approx.4%, the market didn't crash. Why don't you tweet something U know, NOTHING
746 2018-02-05 22:42:45 Welp....stocks do go down.
747 2018-02-05 22:42:41 Unless you bought those stocks on margin and then have a margin call which makes you sell while it falls
748 2018-02-05 22:42:38 Buying stocks like crazy lmao
749 2018-02-05 22:42:20 That would suggest we don't have 401ks or pensions with employer contributions backed by stocks or individual market investments.
Why would you find it necessary to make such an asinine statement? Are we, the have not's, supposed to feel sorry that you lost? 
#FUGR
750 2018-02-05 22:42:19 My stocks took a nose dive and my paycheck is less. I don’t even have the $1.50 per week more for my Costco membership.
751 2018-02-05 22:42:13 The Dow’s drop was just a minor Hiccup. It will come even stronger. The sectors that will be rising stars is mixed stocks, EFT’s and Mutual funds. And yes the Martians have landed and will take up residence on Broad St.
752 2018-02-05 22:42:02 A much needed correction.. Stocks are now on sale..A 10% + correction = Deals
753 2018-02-05 22:42:01 Stocks were over priced,A correction was over due.
754 2018-02-05 22:41:58 I'm sure Trump will avoid the subject!! Stocks go up...It's because of him! Stocks Crash................................I hear Crickets.......................More Crickets!!
755 2018-02-05 22:41:57 So, you swore you'd be a buyer of high-flying tech stocks if they just pulled back 10%. Here you go:

Decline from all-time high to Mon close:

$NVDA -14.3%
$AAPL -13.1
$BABA -12.4
$NFLX -11.3
$GOOGL -11.3
$MSFT -8.4
$FB -7.2
$AMZN -7.2

vs Nasdaq -7.2
756 2018-02-05 22:41:56 Japanese Yen surged last night smashing all in its path!  #GBPJPY -315 pips #EURJPY-225 pips 
#Stocks CRASH!!  
Dow Jones -1100 points in horror session -4.60% to 24345.75 
#stockcrash #Sharemarketcrash #dowjones #forextrading
757 2018-02-05 22:41:55 POLL

The #StockMarket had a vicious sell off today. $DJIA $SPY and major stocks like $GOOGL $XOM and $WFC got hammered. #Bitcoin keeps crashing 

Question - what now? 

Buy
Sell
Hold
758 2018-02-05 22:41:28 Just spent five hours on a plane. Anything exciting happen?

[checks stocks]


759 2018-02-05 22:41:26 Hell no I'm selling weak profits and holding stocks with big profits that show resistance to the downtown. Already sold my small losses yesterday
760 2018-02-05 22:41:26 Good riddance to these stupid $VIX leveraged derivative asinine products. People should trade real stocks. This makes market healthier imo. $XIV $SVXY
761 2018-02-05 22:41:23 Yes but there will likely be individual stocks that don't recover as fast.. or at all...

Might be more accurate to say "if your *strategy* was good yesterday it's still good today"
762 2018-02-05 22:41:22 When you see stocks sinking like this, the DOW JONES dropping -1100, but gold rising, that's globalists deliberately tanking the economy and backing up their investments w/gold because they're not done yet. It's all they have left. This isn't good. #StockMarketCrash
763 2018-02-05 22:41:13 Look at today stocks. It fell below 600 twice on last Friday & today in Trump's first term
764 2018-02-05 22:41:08 3- The fundamentals are fine.
4- Earnings estimates are 15% higher than last year and last year was good.
5- P/E ratios are were they were for the last 3yrs so stocks arent THAT expensive. (They are somewhat 'historically expensive' when talking about P/E ratios at 19 times)
765 2018-02-05 22:41:02 my stocks :(
766 2018-02-05 22:40:59 Trump's tax policies helped drive growth. The market is realizing results aren't as strong as predicted. Retail is still shit. Market is self correcting. Also poor tech sector results last week. Stocks are mostly dependant on short term gains.
767 2018-02-05 22:40:58 The only stocks they know are attached to gun barrels
768 2018-02-05 22:40:58 Let's not bankrupt everyone else just to get #Trump. I depend on #Stocks to fund my #retirement.
769 2018-02-05 22:40:56 Hard to buy stocks when you can't afford socks.
770 2018-02-05 22:40:42 Number of leading stocks today: 13 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
771 2018-02-05 22:40:33 Was it @RusevBUL day at the #NYSE ? Because stocks just got crushed!
772 2018-02-05 22:40:32 What’s better than this? Stocks being troops
773 2018-02-05 22:40:24 To all the crypto currency critics that say crypto is a bubble and stocks are safer, would you like to be the kettle or the pot? Doesn't matter because their both black.  $BTC $ETH #DowJones
774 2018-02-05 22:40:23 Hey Mr. President,
Since you took credit for the stocks going up this year, are you going to take credit for it going down or blame President Obama...
775 2018-02-05 22:40:22 Question remains.... will Trumpers put their money into stocks tomorrow or sell out.  #StockMarketCrash
776 2018-02-05 22:40:17 Why would this be true only for holders of those stocks though? Anyone can have beliefs about asset returns not just their owners.
777 2018-02-05 22:40:16 The market had an expected correction and it’s not the end of the world. It’s the time to buy! #stocks
778 2018-02-05 22:40:14 You know Trump scandals arent the case cause they havent effected the market thusfar. Sure defecit spending might be a problem, but again, defecit spending is nothing new.

This is almost certainly due to anticipated Fed interst rates, and the overvaluing of stocks
779 2018-02-05 22:40:13 It took a long time for us to learn enough to get an idea about what to do. It's complicated.

Money Market is like a savings account, but slightly better interest. So it won't really grow, but it's not in stocks so it didn't get hit.
780 2018-02-05 22:40:10 Their hands were too busy selling stocks.
781 2018-02-05 22:40:10 It was a fun split screen on CNN earlier: “Trump in Ohio touting stocks, tax cuts” with a corner showing Dow at -1500...
782 2018-02-05 22:40:07 WHY DOESN'T @realDonaldTrump SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE LARGEST STOCK DROP IN HISTORY?? HE ONLY TALKS ABOUT STOCKS WHEN THEY RISE!!!! HE'S A CON MAN AND HE CONNED ALL @realDonaldTrump SUPPORTERS #CONMANTRUMP
783 2018-02-05 22:40:06 Just a correction or much more to come? Stocks off huge more than 10% already!  Commodities will cycle and silver will be explosive, start diversifying now!#EconomicCollapse, #Commodities, #StockMarketCrash
784 2018-02-05 22:40:06 There’s an old saying that the stock market takes the stairs going up and the elevator going down. But over time, investments in stocks will grow. Relax, invest for the long haul and leave the freaking out to the day traders. #DowJones
785 2018-02-05 22:40:05 Reportedly, Trump is mulling replacing the Dow with a new system, in which Sarah Huckabee Sanders would appear every day at 4 p.m. to announce how high stocks had skyrocketed.
786 2018-02-05 22:39:50 Trumpsters are all over this...Dems know nothing abt the market, & this dive is a good thing. “It needed to level out and (we) should quit whining and buy stocks right now.” They don’t seem to understand that I was simply stating their #TraitorInChief will blame Obama for this.
787 2018-02-05 22:39:48 "US stocks took a further steep plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,179 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year."

Ай стига с тая Тръмп-фенщинс :-)
788 2018-02-05 22:39:38 A welcome buying opportunity today. Increased $GOOG, $MSFT and $BRKB to 5%, 3% and ~10.5% of single stocks. Increased $PRGTX to 2.1% of assets. Tech is now 17% of equities. Cash is 11% of assets. I considered buying Wells Fargo, but it already had a good run before today's drop.
789 2018-02-05 22:39:33 As long as economy keeps chugging along at 3-4% growth rate, stocks will do just fine. W/interest rates now allowed to rise more volatility introduced into markets. Longer-term view on stock markets always best
790 2018-02-05 22:39:10 No... that camp is clueless.   Stocks under pressure means the Fed may have to move sooner..
791 2018-02-05 22:39:05 Anyone who thinks a president has control over the stock market aside from their rhetoric is a moron. Stocks are pure speculation. Stockholders control the stocks. If a company does something bad, they sell them in fear of their value going down, causing their value to go down.
792 2018-02-05 22:38:55 1- It was a Flash Crash due to high frequency trading and  institutional investors were all prepared for it and their stops were all programmed at the same levels.

2- People then started selling downward insurance therefore they had to short stocks to hedge.
793 2018-02-05 22:38:45 Since both stocks and btc are dropping it might be a good idea to look at gold again 
794 2018-02-05 22:38:41 @CNBCFastMoney 

Contrary to what was just said by one of your moderators, most people do not own stocks.
795 2018-02-05 22:38:34 I sold a bunch of stocks on Friday and now, have a terrible feeling that this is all my fault.
796 2018-02-05 22:38:30 Stocks go down when salaries rise has been stated, too.
797 2018-02-05 22:38:23 similar action in stocks today, but wouldn't say people are "'vomiting" just yet :P
798 2018-02-05 22:38:17 @OphirGottlieb if market gaps down BIG tomorrow, are you buying any stocks?
799 2018-02-05 22:38:05 The fact people were buying into Bitcoin at the same time they were selling off stocks today has me concerned for humanity.
800 2018-02-05 22:37:55 I'm waiting for him to bring back the firing squad, the stocks and trial by water.
801 2018-02-05 22:37:55 I am actually glad that I sold some of my stocks before today, fearing that an overcorrection of this magnitude would happen soon.

805 2018-02-05 22:37:43 Bitcoin drops in sync- did they pull out all the dirty money from stocks and BC?
806 2018-02-05 22:37:38 You're trading penny stocks
807 2018-02-05 22:37:35 Who’s out there selling stocks?  Who’s buying stocks?  #TangibleLeadership
808 2018-02-05 22:37:30 and most of us middle class people with a 401K or Roth aren't looking at 'get rich quick' anyway. Stocks are a long term investment.
809 2018-02-05 22:37:26 Another record in stocks today #MAGA
810 2018-02-05 22:37:25 @realDonaldTrump Hey Trump! Buy up all the stocks that the democrats are dumping today!
811 2018-02-05 22:37:21 Wow, all of my stocks went down today, which is a normal thing most people have
812 2018-02-05 22:37:16 Headline should read: “People sold their stocks to get into bitcoin”
813 2018-02-05 22:37:14 #DowJones dropping 1175 points shows that every market can be volatile. 
Every argument against #cryptocurrency only based on that is pure nonsense.

814 2018-02-05 22:37:06 The Dems & MSM made it clear that stock market doesn’t effect working class folks as they don’t have 401K or stocks (when stock market broke records). So no big deal to them now right? Can’t have it both ways.
815 2018-02-05 22:37:03 It's just a correction. 
This is a Great buying opportunity. 
Many Stocks are already up in After Hours Trading.
816 2018-02-05 22:37:02 I'm a little disappointed in Alex blaming a boring ole manipulation. I was hoping for something more creative like 'stock market hasn't really dropped, Obama hired crisis actors to pretend to sell stocks and Comey planted fake numbers in the press to cover it up.'
817 2018-02-05 22:37:01 YALL SEE THESE STOCKS?
818 2018-02-05 22:36:58 Rich people just got an enamous tax cut. I’m not werried if John d Rockefeller had a rough day for his portfolio. I want lower priced quality stocks that I can buy and hold onto for 30 years
819 2018-02-05 22:36:50 How about the federal reserve chair Janet Yellen Who retired on Friday and called stocks too high and raised the federal rate
820 2018-02-05 22:36:48 Another Black Friday... More than $90b in value wiped out from popular 'FANG' tech stocks  like Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Netflix. #stocks #StockMarketCrash #StockMarket #BlackMonday
821 2018-02-05 22:36:46 Dimwit @realDonaldTrump and his cronies’ decisions are starting to ruin country. Stocks lose most EVER. Just the beginning. Sad
822 2018-02-05 22:36:43 Hope U were able 2 capitalize on the irrational & exaggerated fear in the markets 2day by buying under-valued stocks destined 2 hit new heights soon: $MA, $AMZN, $AAPL, and $JNJ. Today’s flash crash is a rare gift, an opportunity 2 buy at a dramatic discount.
823 2018-02-05 22:36:41 Breaking News: Dow, S&P, stocks drop huge. This in & of itself it NOT news. Carry on. That is all.
824 2018-02-05 22:36:39 When essentially the stock market dictates how companies spend their money into growth and development, it does have an impact to our economy. The lower the stocks go, the less corporations will spend on new hires and expansion, and will cause job loss and high unemployment
825 2018-02-05 22:36:32 Stocks are starting to fall amid worries about inflation and the government having to borrow more money to pay for the tax cuts to corporations. Congrats!
826 2018-02-05 22:36:27 He got rid of all the bad stocks. There’s only good stocks now.
827 2018-02-05 22:36:27 PLEASE don’t invest 100% of your retirement savings in stocks that are part of the DJIA.  Please don’t.
828 2018-02-05 22:36:17 Stocks just erased the gain for the year.  FYI: That's your fault.
829 2018-02-05 22:36:14 But my stocks all plummeted. WTF happened to the strong economy?
830 2018-02-05 22:36:14 Hello @realDonaldTrump the Dow just had its biggest 1-day point loss ever. Do you plan on taking credit for that, as you did when stocks were rising?
831 2018-02-05 22:36:08 Good so you are going to address the 1500 drop in stocks?
832 2018-02-05 22:36:04 Someone cleaned the swamp lol. Just the way it is in stock market. Some days you are up and some days you are down. When sticks are low interest rates grow. When stocks are up interest rates drop. Economics 101.
833 2018-02-05 22:35:57 what if schiff is double-correct when both crypto and stocks collapse at the same time and the price of gold shoots up to 20,000 USD an oz
834 2018-02-05 22:35:54 Stocks taking a battering. But somehow my stock in BOI is up!
835 2018-02-05 22:35:51 If this is a stock market crash or recession, I can’t wait. You can buy stocks at an all time low. Think long term investing.
836 2018-02-05 22:35:50 Exactly

Plus, it wouldn't be my first trade to go to zero - stupid chinese bubble stocks and LNCO and.....did I just admit this out loud?
837 2018-02-05 22:35:44 Tfw your 'safe low risk capital' is all in stocks
838 2018-02-05 22:35:40 Best to look at it as the volatility of a single stock, as the crypto market moves with BTC. Individual stocks can move by those amounts even in regular stock markets
839 2018-02-05 22:35:15 I'm wondering if now is a good time to buy stocks 
840 2018-02-05 22:35:14 it’s actually good the stock market fel because there was starting to be too many stocks to handle
841 2018-02-05 22:35:14 Another huge drop in stocks and @elliotwaveintl can't come up with any helpful information to negotioate this, to trade, to do anything. What are we paying for? #elliotwave analysis should include some helpful wave counts, no? Some levels to watch for, no?
842 2018-02-05 22:35:13 Don’t really know where to start with that tweet.....I must assume the Sky cocktail cabinet is now bereft of all stocks as you’ve necked the lot!
843 2018-02-05 22:35:08 And stocks went way down!

845 2018-02-05 22:35:07 Dow falls nearly 1,200 points
 Biggest points plunge in history
Stocks went into free fall, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points - easily biggest point decline in history during a trading day

Dow closed down 1,175 points. BAHAHAHAHAHAHA. LOSER!
846 2018-02-05 22:35:06 And my stocks are in the toilet.  #ThanksTrump
847 2018-02-05 22:34:57 A healthy decoupling of the Cannabis sector today vs US Stocks, Bitcoin, Risk assets. Uncorrelated growth is often sought in uncertain tape. Correlation worth watching to see if a true trend is established.
848 2018-02-05 22:34:49 Corrections by modest percent will be in the thousands because the baseline is much higher now. Thank God there are fears of impending interest rate increases. The elderly haven't made decent interest on their slow-growth stocks, bonds or T-bills for a decade!

854 2018-02-05 22:33:57 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling nearly 1,600 points during the session, its biggest intraday decline in history, as investors grappled with rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation.

864 2018-02-05 22:33:27 The Russians are still sending out all their bots with fake news in full throttle mode every day to help you . Dow Jones stocks  plunged today 1,500 points the biggest in history . Ur not talking about that little Donnie are you ? 666 you know this number right ?
865 2018-02-05 22:33:18 Traditionally, Germans indeed do buy local stocks. Also those who own stocks indirectly (e.g. through pension funds) rather invest in German companies than overseas.
866 2018-02-05 22:33:11 An asset is an asset. Stocks will just be denominated in #Bitcoin instead of fiat in the future. But stocks will still be relevant. Same with other assets. They will remain assets, but the denomination will change. Fiat has a huge problem though...

882 2018-02-05 22:31:47 Calls #market a bubble @ 18000, claims credit @ 26000 (no bubble anymore).

His base must've got out of stocks at 18000 & got back in at 26000 

If market crashes to 18000, he'll be like: "Oh noo.. it's a bubble again!"

Guess who's making stupidity great again.

890 2018-02-05 22:30:48 Well it is crypto not stocks. Doesn't play by the same rules.

893 2018-02-05 22:30:44 Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,175 points today, the largest one-day raw points drop in history, including 2008. When everyone sells, it's time to buy! Stay the course. Can't beat 4% discounts on stocks.
#StockMarket | #WarrenBuffett | #StockDeals
894 2018-02-05 22:30:36 This is true. The only reason to move some is just so you don't experience a devastating market crash just as you're about to retire. We'll always keep a good chunk in stocks to compensate, but have a bond bottom that won't fall out.
895 2018-02-05 22:30:28 Plus if you understand how trading markets work (which I don't entirely), circulation or use of stocks/coin should help to increase the value of that stock/coin
896 2018-02-05 22:30:18 So u not in camp that fed can't move (higher aggressive rates) if stocks stay under pressure/ if current climate continues?

905 2018-02-05 22:29:12 @POTUS and his #WallStreetCabinet should be investigated for #MarketManipulations. Stocks tumbled today #Bigly. The most since 2011. @WhiteHouse @GOP @SenateGOP @DNC @CNNMoney @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS
906 2018-02-05 22:29:02 Best tweet on my feed today.  Shows why being tempered instead of being a braggart serves better for being POTUS and running the country.  Stocks rise, fall on whims and news of the day, beyond the control of one person. If Presidents could control the Dow, it would always go up.
907 2018-02-05 22:29:02 In percentage terms the fall in stocks is not catastrophic
908 2018-02-05 22:28:56 What about my 401K?  Stocks are tanking after a tax cut?

910 2018-02-05 22:28:41 Actually this one can be tied to Trump.

Because of the deficit increases due to Trump tax cuts. The us Treasury is issuing more bonds, to keep inflation in check the interest rates on those bonds is higher. 

So people are selling stocks and buying bonds...
911 2018-02-05 22:28:40 I was joking (and I agree). If rates are up, stocks should move down given the pricing mechanism.
912 2018-02-05 22:28:36 Out eating lunch with my mother and she tells me she lost 12k in her stock today. 

Wtf... since when did you invest in stocks?! #shook
913 2018-02-05 22:28:31 Central Banks print money or electronically creat funds to purchase bonds or stocks. They also use tools like adjusting interest rate policy and currency agreements with other central banks #FinancialSocialism @federalreserve @ecb #BoJ #DarkMoney
914 2018-02-05 22:28:23 so since Trump claims he’s responsible for stocks and the economy going up, will he claim responsibility for this?
915 2018-02-05 22:28:19 @realDonaldTrump what up with the stock market? Have you decided to take it down a little to help your friend short a few stocks?
916 2018-02-05 22:28:12 $DOW closes down 1,175  points or 4.60%. We have now given back roughly 2,400 points in the last week and a half. This market is headed lower in my opinion as some stocks are still up on the year. We have not even seen retail selling yet
917 2018-02-05 22:28:06 Might not be a bad time to sell off some of your stocks and buy crypto while it’s a bargain. Then buy back stocks in a few months, when *they’re* at bargain prices.
918 2018-02-05 22:27:59 yes they are, stocks haven't had anything to do with prole wages for a long time and they only ever did bc the rich decided to take from their workers to protect their own wealth
919 2018-02-05 22:27:58 I don't think that stocks will suffer fundamentally (might short term drop 60%+) in the new world order with BTC, they will just eventually be denominated in #Bitcoin instead of fiat. Companies can still generate profit.
920 2018-02-05 22:27:44 NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years.
921 2018-02-05 22:27:44 It's funny the past year everybody said Obama was the reason the stocks were up..now they dropped a lil bit and it's trumps fault? How's that work #StockMarket
922 2018-02-05 22:27:39 Why am I hearing the % drop in stocks is more important than net value loss? Is it for real or just to put us plebs' minds at ease?
923 2018-02-05 22:27:32 Absolute bloodbath with my stocks today :(
924 2018-02-05 22:27:30 Stocks went down ...again
925 2018-02-05 22:27:29 I’m not sure single stock stories invalidate the hypothesis though: the problem for single stocks is even harder because the inputs to the price function are even more idiosyncratic, so you generally don’t have any useful heuristics to guess them
926 2018-02-05 22:27:26 Why can’t the headline be “stocks cheaper today, go shopping!”
927 2018-02-05 22:27:18 No, I'm just saying.

Whenever good things happen to stocks, it's because of Obama, right?
928 2018-02-05 22:27:17 STOCKS

930 2018-02-05 22:27:03 Calm down, for God's sake. Non-quality stocks are slated to correct more steeply. So what? Same old story; get used to it. Long-run players have little to worry about. The stock market has never been in a long-term downward trend.

932 2018-02-05 22:26:56 As long as he doesn’t sell any stocks while they are dropping he hasn’t lost anything.
933 2018-02-05 22:26:51 Maybe I'm paranoid, but wouldn't it make sense for billionaires to sell enough stocks to tank the market, get their tax cut money, and then buy them all back?  #StockMarketCrash
934 2018-02-05 22:26:48 You’re a lousy businessman. You don’t care about America.

938 2018-02-05 22:26:29 You been in office since 1975... And your record is horid. Not sure i can place any trust in you. Your position has changed on border security, banks, stocks, political finance, crime legislation, abortion, gay right, gun control... U seem to sell out to the lobbyist positions
939 2018-02-05 22:26:15 Stocks dive -1117 points in one day! -1841 in 2 days! 
Hey @realDonaldtrmp All this WINNING! must be making ur empty head spin!

"WE are WINNING! Stocks DROP most in singel day EVER! Most biggest EVER!"

941 2018-02-05 22:26:05 DJIA down 4.6% today and S&P 500 by 3.7% - a massive shake-out on over-valuation of stocks, threat of inflation and higher interest rates with a bit of bond bubble thrown in for good measure! Equities have come to far too quickly!
942 2018-02-05 22:25:57 What else is hilarious is that liberals also give obama all of the credit for everything good in stocks, but when something bad happens, blame Trump!
943 2018-02-05 22:25:52 I see this as an effort by our nation's enemies to make @realDonaldTrump look bad.  We have been proud of the booming economy.  There have been threats, now realized.  The Dow Jones is merely an average of a few stocks.  Cybercurrency not well recognized.  Other days will come!
944 2018-02-05 22:25:49 Trump @realDonaldTrump takes full responsibility for stocks rise but where is he when they crash?   He’s off pouting about people not giving him standing “O”’s at SOTU....un-fucking real!!!!!
945 2018-02-05 22:25:42 [buys stocks]
946 2018-02-05 22:25:41 I’m having a hard time with this one... interest as in shares/stocks?
947 2018-02-05 22:25:40 If you still have stocks in the stock market, your pullout game WEAK
948 2018-02-05 22:25:37 It'll also be interesting what happens in Asia when their markets open in a few hours cuz if they see us going down, they worry and possibly sell their stocks to, which leads to a loss & then we panic and sell more stocks cuz they selling etc.becomes a cycle.
949 2018-02-05 22:25:37 Fantastic News!! Folks, I don’t know abt. You All, But Some Folks Who Survived Vegas Shooting Showed Their Wounds On The News Channels And They Are Horrific And Will Need More Surgeries And Care!! Gotta Pass “No Bump Stocks” At Least!!
950 2018-02-05 22:25:30 Correction that was a 27 car field that night but on occasion we run with 40 street stocks at Colorado national speedway
951 2018-02-05 22:25:28 Check ya stocks ppl, check ya stocks
952 2018-02-05 22:25:17 ive lost $69.69 in stocks the last 3 days. thats a pretty sick joke @realDonaldTrump
953 2018-02-05 22:25:09 Praying for anyone that has stocks right now
954 2018-02-05 22:25:06 “Dismal DOW is overrated. I used to be a fan, did a lot for it, and it never even thanked me. It’s failing, full of fake stocks and Crooked Hillary investments. Dump the Dow! Sad!” - @realDonaldTrump, probably
955 2018-02-05 22:25:00 Small-Caps and Mid-Caps specifically tech and financials are on clearance! Tax reform will give these companies better free cash flow and an improved EBITDA. More money to invest in customer acquisition, R&D and acquisitions! #smallcap #midcap #stocks #bonds #nyse #nasdaq #cboe
956 2018-02-05 22:24:59 Best time to buy stocks and Crypto..
957 2018-02-05 22:24:57 Please tell Daddy thanks for tanking my stocks today (02/05/2018).  I bet he'll find someway to blame former President Obama @BarackObama .  Y'all need to learn how to accept responsibility, s.
958 2018-02-05 22:24:55 And the republicans won’t do anything. It is shameful that your government is allowing him to act this way. My gosh don’t you realize you guys are laughing stocks to the world. You know why nk isn’t doing anything because he is waiting for you to implode
959 2018-02-05 22:24:53 Well it's a long way down if a bear market really takes hold but you're right of course, stocks are the only game in town if you want to grow wealth over the long term!
960 2018-02-05 22:24:44 Of course they arent. Theyll lie about it. Media will report the lies. His supporters will believe them. Rest if us will continue pulling our hair out. #DownJones #stocks
961 2018-02-05 22:24:44 #Beer stocks, day after Super Bowl compared to last trading day before  game:
A-B InBev: Down 4.79 %, from $111.76 to $106.97.
MolsonCoors: Down 4.17 %, from $82.84 to $77.68.
Pabst): Down 5.8 %, from $19.70 to $18.70
Boston Beer: Down 2.56 %, from $185.30 to $180.55.
962 2018-02-05 22:24:42 Your reply is a testament to the death of irony, wit, sarcasm, paradox and literacy in general. The fact that you took my point about stocks literally is so sad.
963 2018-02-05 22:24:36 I think I’m gonna buy some stocks today. #StockMarketToday #DowJones #1000+
964 2018-02-05 22:24:35 It goes up, and it comes down. And do you WANT the stocks to drop, CNN, or what? You've become disturbingly anti American since the election. What's the matter? Your Marxist dream has come to an end?
965 2018-02-05 22:24:32 According to Forbes, Warren Buffet lost $5.3 Billion today... I doubt he’s selling off all his stocks during the dip because of it.

#cryptocrash #cryptocurrencies
966 2018-02-05 22:24:27 Stocks up 6k, Obama did it. 
Down 1.5k, Trump did it. 
Liberal logic...
967 2018-02-05 22:24:26 As someone who is going to be buying some stocks in a month, I heartily support the #StockMarketCrash El Dotardo has created.
968 2018-02-05 22:24:19 Can you imagine if the stock market had been pricing in block chain all along, and all this fud has caused a systematic shock... oh and by the way - if stocks capitulate this time, the fed will print another bazillion dollars #BTC #21mm
969 2018-02-05 22:24:18 Interesting factoid. That is also close to 5% of the population. So do you mostly buy local stocks?
970 2018-02-05 22:24:14 Did not see panic selling in HY today. Concerns are not economic but valuations + prospect of pos-correlated stocks and bonds in a weak mkt. We picked up some benefit today from a weaker CAD after a headwind in 2017. More commentary to come. Keep your head up in the corners
971 2018-02-05 22:24:13 @Glenisk what shops stocks your Greek style natural yoghurt with vanilla & coconut? We got it in TescoDundrun &its delish, but’s no longer there!!
972 2018-02-05 22:24:07 STOCKS

Real value of DOW: six to eight thousand

Real value of S&P: six to eight hundred

Real value of crude oil: fifteen to twenty dollars
973 2018-02-05 22:24:05 If you truly want to boost a country’s economy, give money to the poor, they will spend it. # rich will hoard it causing stocks to crash
974 2018-02-05 22:24:04 These r more like normal times n the #volatility $VIX will lead 2 #stocks buying opps & good #option trading 4 the future   Follow ye ol @stockpirate for research #stock trending & #invest insights 4 the retail investor  I follow the market, do the research so u can beat the pros
975 2018-02-05 22:23:59 People close to the markets were warning about this for a while, it’s no surprise. Many stocks have been overvalued for a long time for no economical reason. The time when valuations worked mathematically is long gone. Noone knows what happens next.
976 2018-02-05 22:23:55 Why aren’t you talking stocks today? Maybe cause DOW is way down. Come on take the credit for it!  You can’t take only the credit for the good things and ignore the bad. But yet you do everyday 
977 2018-02-05 22:23:54 selling stocks is as sacriligious as your wife selling your funko pop collection. your supposed to collect& keep them so you can organize them in your portfolios
978 2018-02-05 22:23:46 okay, so the VIX will spike huge as the shorts cover at tje opening and that could cause big downward pressure on stocks, Unnatural downward pressure.
979 2018-02-05 22:23:39 Check your stocks today? Worst day ever! Not really but I use selective information to make the case. You know how that works.
980 2018-02-05 22:23:24 Stocks plunging like crazy, I think we’re off the Obamawave economy.
981 2018-02-05 22:23:08 4:16 PM : Stocks have ended the day sharply lower. The Dow closed -1175.21 at 24,345.75 and the S&P 500 closed -113.19 at 2,648.94. Mortgage Bonds are +61bp at 100.84. via @mbsHighway
982 2018-02-05 22:23:06 Short version: DT’s new Fed Reserve chair signaled she wants to raise interest rates faster than expected. This caused brokers to move investments from stocks to bonds. Stocks hit hardest we’re the ones that make up the Dow Jones. Think old money, oil, and the like.
983 2018-02-05 22:22:57 Patriots lose. Stocks plummet. #BlameBelichick
984 2018-02-05 22:22:55 You’re currently losing money as it is. No one should pay for these memberships lol.  

The market is not predictable, if you believe these people can do So well sorry for yah lol

Crypto is not stocks.
985 2018-02-05 22:22:53 Two weeks ago I decided the stock market seemed irrationally exuberant and moved my measly 401k mostly out of stocks. So today I feel like working class Warren Buffett
986 2018-02-05 22:22:46 There is nothing out about contract with Sprint. How do you know this?
987 2018-02-05 22:22:41 It doesn't really matter. Stocks and shares-Up and down-always have-always will but 
Deep State. Killary. Obama Bin Laden just going Down Down Down. #DrainTheDeepState #HillaryForPrison #ObamaGate #QAnon #ReleaseTheOtherMemos
988 2018-02-05 22:22:39 Largest day single drop in stocks. Great job!
989 2018-02-05 22:22:37 Future on the $nikkei looks pretty ugly..
#selloff #NIKKEI #stocks @AlpariRA
990 2018-02-05 22:22:35 Might be time to try my hand at shorting... i think i should start with stocks tho, crypto shorts still scare me
991 2018-02-05 22:22:31 @realDonaldTrump Are you taking credit for the biggest drop in stocks today (since 2011)??? You claim the gains, have to suck it up and take credit for the bad too!!
992 2018-02-05 22:22:30 Should always know your stocks
993 2018-02-05 22:22:21 The lord works in mysterious ways, right Donald, 1st he giveth and then he taketh away. Tell America who's fault this is. Stocks at all-time highs breaking records because of me.
994 2018-02-05 22:22:14 Fears over China’s struggling economy, slumping commodity prices and uncertainty regarding the timing of the Fed’s highly anticipated interest-rate increase have all combined to form the perfect storm to knock US stocks down from record-high levels. Are you a day trader, Sport?
995 2018-02-05 22:22:07 Everything is cyclical. Since there has been little to no profit taking the past year, any correction was bound to be epic. But any talk of a crash is foolish. The underlying fundamentals for both individual influential stocks and the economy in general are strong. 

To the top!
996 2018-02-05 22:21:58 Should you close the barn door after the cows are long gone? Should you sell your stocks after they drop a bunch? Same answer to both....no.
997 2018-02-05 22:21:58 NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years
998 2018-02-05 22:21:56 Stocks crashed
999 2018-02-05 22:21:52 Don't  know how much buying was real. Are people just buying stocks to make a quick buck or are people investing. Anytime, there are large amounts of speculators, a big drop will occur.
1000 2018-02-05 22:21:52 Under Obama the #Stockmarket did pretty good

Dow: 7,949 to 19,732 (148% increase)

S&P: 805 to 2,264 (181% increase)

If you think presidents push magical buttons that make stocks go up or down you should think Obama is one of the best presidents of all time.
1001 2018-02-05 22:21:42 No worries. It only effects the rich. MSM & Dem leaders have assured us that regular folks don’t have 401k or stocks.
1002 2018-02-05 22:21:41 @MelissaAFrancis @DavidAsmanfox we all agree @robinbiro is always fair. I disagree re Trump touting Stock gains. Anyone who understands stocks know this is NOT a big deal, was expected, and stocks WILL go back up.
1003 2018-02-05 22:21:26 Are you sane? Our GDP is effectively .4% if stocks stay like this, and you think it's someone besides you who cannot see?
1004 2018-02-05 22:21:23 Yay, I get stocks on sale tomorrow with dollar cost averaging for when I cash out in 25 years
1005 2018-02-05 22:21:17 Between #Stocks and #Bitcoin this has been a great day for Twitter lols
1006 2018-02-05 22:21:17 My robinhood app blowing up with these stocks losing value lmao
1007 2018-02-05 22:21:16 They just needed to wait until after the SOTU speech to start selling off their stocks.
1008 2018-02-05 22:21:15 #LiarInChief #stocks #StockMarketCrash #trumprussia
1009 2018-02-05 22:21:15 But our stocks are going WAY down.
1010 2018-02-05 22:21:10 Could Bitcoin speculators have needed to sell off stocks to cover?
1011 2018-02-05 22:21:09 Embarrassing?  Stocks were under 20,000 when Trump took office.  After an historic drop, they're still at 24,000.  This is just more blatant Trump hate from CNN, the most shithole name in news.
1012 2018-02-05 22:21:07 Stocks adjusting.
Media making a big deal.
Who gives a crap. Market will adjust before the weekend.
Economy is BETTER then EVER
1013 2018-02-05 22:21:06 Correction much needed and was always coming. No 2008 yet....just a shake due to interest rate rise and general market jitters. Think a week or so of pain in the wider markets then settle/bounce..all about stocks that are cashed up,near bottom on chart & have solid NT catalysts
1014 2018-02-05 22:21:02 Stocks went up but the value of the dollar dropped. Thanks creepy racist grandpa.
1015 2018-02-05 22:21:01 i have a joke about stocks where it turns out i'm really talking about soup but i'm a very busy man so i'll post the pieces and you can put it together however you want:

1016 2018-02-05 22:21:01 @jimcramer @CNBCFastMoney Please explain how so many stocks can have high ratings and unbelievably high earnings and the market PLUNGE like it has the last three days.  First day was day of Trump SOfU caused by Soros and Steyer and other hedgies with their giant new bond position
1017 2018-02-05 22:21:00 @bobbie_daniel12 Told you this was happening. You keep drinking that Trump-ade.
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years.
1018 2018-02-05 22:20:50 I doubt too many of them own any stocks, so it doesn't affect them so much. Not directly, anyways.
1019 2018-02-05 22:20:47 How much you wanna bet... dems are behind the stocks crashing? Hmmm
1020 2018-02-05 22:20:41 Stocks plummeting, Government shutdown looming AGAIN...and news cycle is non stop cover #NunesFakeMemo Did anyone read the nothingness that is this memo? So disheartening :( Time to listen to my #Watergate podcast to remind myself how this all ends.
1021 2018-02-05 22:20:38 What I don't get is that EVERYONE, EVERY TV SHOW, EVERY TRADER last week was essentially positive and recommending stocks....BUT TODAY $SPX -11% AND everyone is buying puts, shaking in their boots and afraid to recommend the stocks?!!? hey we wanted panic & we got it!
1022 2018-02-05 22:20:31 Wake up, Jacob! US stocks took a further steep plunge today with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,179 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year.
1023 2018-02-05 22:20:27 What I don't get is that EVERYONE, EVERY TV SHOW, EVERY TRADER last week was essentially positive and recommending stocks....BUT TODAY $SPX -11% AND everyone is buying puts, shaking in their boots and afraid to recommend the stocks?!!? hey we wanted panic & we got it!
1024 2018-02-05 22:20:26 Nope. Note that only about 4 million German citizens own stocks directly, so how to sell something you don't even have?
1025 2018-02-05 22:20:15 @realDonaldTrump Stocks DOWN 666 points on Friday. Stocks DOWN 1175 points today. You take credit when it goes well, you can take the blame when it goes bad.
1026 2018-02-05 22:20:13 Wish I knew how to get involved with stocks now would be a great time!
1027 2018-02-05 22:20:11 My marijuana stocks are holding up well, thank Jah
1028 2018-02-05 22:20:06 Pheeewwwwww boyyyyyy. Why’d I dump all my disposable income on stocks. I’m poor. I’m not built for the loss.
1029 2018-02-05 22:20:01 Time to buy up stocks seeing how the big movers and shakers decided to take profits and make it look like the economy might lag. #WeSeeYou #MAGA
1030 2018-02-05 22:20:01 I still don't know anything about stocks but I still like to freak out about them.
1031 2018-02-05 22:19:52 President @realDonaldTrump should tweet promptly to calm the stocks!
1032 2018-02-05 22:19:50 Wouldn't argue with a TH on any of my stocks today 
1033 2018-02-05 22:19:28 Stocks go up and down that’s the way it is. Markets are volatile always have been
1034 2018-02-05 22:19:27 Time to buy a little more oil stocks.
1035 2018-02-05 22:19:20 I'm not much of an investor, but when I read things in MorningStar and MarketWatch that Execs of various big Corps have been selling their stocks in their OWN companies,"signally that they are turning bearish," you gotta think the market is overvalued. They would know, right?
1036 2018-02-05 22:19:19 I'm selling my stocks, for the troops
1037 2018-02-05 22:19:15 However STOCKS just went DOWN. No mention of that.  You mentioned it when they went up and took credit for it!!!!
1038 2018-02-05 22:19:09 Hey Trump the stocks market took a beating today, the DowJones down to an all time low. Not tweeting about this are you?  You are fast to take credit when the market do well but you are ignoring the Dow plunge.

Guess you are busy finding a scapegoat.

#LoserTrump
1039 2018-02-05 22:19:05 U.S. stocks fell sharply Monday, extending a steep sell-off from the previous session, as investors rushed for the exits in the wake of rising interest rates. For the S&P 500, it was the worst day in six years.

#thankstRump #impeachtrump
1040 2018-02-05 22:19:05 And your stock market is going WAY down. If you're going to take credit for the highs, you better own the lows big guy.#MAGA #stocks #markets
1041 2018-02-05 22:19:02 US economic system is debt based & fairly old Has negative energy flow. According to Second Law of Thernodynamics, it must go to lowest enthropy level. Stocks have long way down to reach that level. Many corporations will die. Result: socio-economic chaos will increase. Will see.
1042 2018-02-05 22:19:01 So people took 5% of the profit they made in stocks and mover it over to bonds?  What it the panic about?
1043 2018-02-05 22:19:00 Actually it wont. If we didn't sell our stocks, we didn't lose any money.
1044 2018-02-05 22:19:00 Last chance to liquidate your stocks and go crypto
1045 2018-02-05 22:18:54 US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. 

Time to find a solid buy and wait for the bounce back after the interest rate hikes...
1046 2018-02-05 22:18:47 I will be watching your show for ideas tonight. I have some beat up stocks I’ve been watching.
1047 2018-02-05 22:18:46 Don’t look at your stocks today.. especially your crypto currencies 
1048 2018-02-05 22:18:45 "Dow suffers historic loss, plunges 1,100+ points"?

Surely not under stable genius and American revolutionary, Donald Trump?

Those of you praising him weeks ago for hikes in stocks, I anxiously await your posts about the plummet.

Probably danged ol' libtard sabotage.
1049 2018-02-05 22:18:40 Slacked on checking my stocks for afew hours and lost 18% lol
1050 2018-02-05 22:18:39 Like weed stocks?
1051 2018-02-05 22:18:36 Time to buy some stocks! #RothIRA #DowJones #TaxCut
1052 2018-02-05 22:18:35 Ok guys somehow these volatility products like $XIV and $SVXY disintegrate into thin air in after hours trading. Tomorrows open could be the most volatile thing the stock market EVER experienced imo. #volatility #stocks ...exciting times!
1053 2018-02-05 22:18:32 No one can say for sure, obviously, but tomorrow I think may see a slight rebound. Long term, stocks are always a smart buy.
1054 2018-02-05 22:18:32 I don't know about that @newagefarminc #NF I think all my tweets are pretty accurate I think the SP speaks for itself doesn't it from the time I started tweeting till now and for we are Kured it launches this month ......but will have no affect on #NF #running #investing #stocks
1055 2018-02-05 22:18:31 They tanked. Doesn't anyone know stocks?
1056 2018-02-05 22:18:30 Checked my stocks today and they went down by 2.54%. Today alone. What is going on. May not sound like a lot but trust me it is
1057 2018-02-05 22:18:30 All my money is in stocks. I think I have it worse
1058 2018-02-05 22:18:26 The biggest drawdown in $XIV history *was* 74.8%, which occurred during the 2nd half of 2011 (slowly).  It is currently down 76.7% as of this post (quickly).  

#Stocks #StockMarketCrash @JLyonsFundMgmt @ZorTrades
1059 2018-02-05 22:18:23 OMG do you think we can forget about all this SB trash and move on to pitchers and catchers? Waddaya think @RealMichaelKay, @Rosenbergradio , @DonLagreca. I think Don is right about over sensitivity. Let Bloomberg worry about stocks falling PLEEEZZZEEE
1060 2018-02-05 22:18:21 Stocks down 1,000 points today, which erases all gains for the year. Can’t wait for @realDonaldTrump to blame it all on Obama and not take any accountability #Dow
1061 2018-02-05 22:18:19 On @BloombergTV - US stocks continue selloff, Asia set to follow; RBA decision due 1130HK; back at the Singapore Airshow w/ @haslindatv; and @YvonneManTV gets the investor view ahead of Malaysia's election, at the World Capital Markets Symposium
1062 2018-02-05 22:18:14 the FED has my back, short vol trade is blowing up!
only thing is 
HOW MUCH OF THE BIG STOCKS THEY HAVE TO SELL TO COVER
1063 2018-02-05 22:18:11 Cramer, the genius who cheerlead stocks right up to the crash?  Then told listeners it wasn’t time to buy back in for months (when they should have never sold)? Yeah, I stopped listening to him forever. Nobody but Velshi had a brain at CNBC.
1064 2018-02-05 22:18:06 To be fair the big headlines are in stocks right now. Though if the US debt ceiling gets close again, that combined with Yellen's exit could get pretty interesting.
1065 2018-02-05 22:18:05 @NBCNews. Investors are nervous because of the of the most likely shut-down of the government; stocks market drops. Democrats needs to help pass a budget.
1066 2018-02-05 22:18:05 And people thought that I was crazy to by oil stocks as New York was dumping theirs.
1067 2018-02-05 22:18:05 2) your current bond yield you are in trouble so you sell and get out putting downward pressure on bond prices. This makes the yields highly attractive so if you are in stocks, you'd want to take a bit of your profits off the table from the recent rally and move it in bonds so
1068 2018-02-05 22:17:57 Today Stocks closed the lowest ever in history . What's your excuse for this one @realDonaldTrump you worthless piece of shit?  #GOP #Trump #DonaldTrump #Republicans
1069 2018-02-05 22:17:56 Yes. It's not like the people who are holding those stocks are going to try to sell them. The value is low but it won't remain that way long. If all of stocks take a dive, then I'd worry. Esp if a sell-off is triggered.
1070 2018-02-05 22:17:43 LOL
"Dividend Stocks!"
"Deep-in-the-money-calls!" 
"BOOYAH!"
1071 2018-02-05 22:17:39 Love that you know nothing about stocks!!

Thank You for FINALLY SAYING IT's TRUMP'S ECONOMY!!

THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!
I'm NOT AS SELFISH AND GREEDY as the ELITE LEFTIES!!

1073 2018-02-05 22:17:29 TRUMPCONOMY, the - 

1. the only thing in history capable of making the Dow Jones drop more than 1000 points in one day; 

2. something trump and deplorables used to brag about because of their vast covfefe stocks, now silence though?!
1074 2018-02-05 22:17:29 If this becomes a second Great Depression by tomorrow I'm really gonna regret this Tweet but please don't forget to buy my book it comes out in paperback tomorrow and it's now a better investment than most stocks
1075 2018-02-05 22:17:25 @LouDobbs lou this fall in the stocks ALL COMPUTER JENA RATED SOMETHING NOT RIGHT
1076 2018-02-05 22:17:20 Most likely Hillary and cohorts selling their stocks to pay for legal expenses.
1077 2018-02-05 22:17:16 Thanks for tanking my stocks today Mr. (02/05/2018).  I bet you'll find someway to blame former President Obama.
1078 2018-02-05 22:17:13 Poor little Donald Trump,  no one Respects you, our stocks are falling,  employment is dropping,  you took President Obama credits for the increase in  employment and the stocks.
You have horrible people skills, no allies want to be associated with the USA..
1079 2018-02-05 22:17:13 @karenfinerman Do you buy puts against individual stocks or SPY when Volatility is low?  As your protection..   thanks!
1080 2018-02-05 22:17:11 To the talking heads comparing today to 1987. No comparison. Not even in the same area code. Stocks dropped 30% 40% on the day. $DJIA
1081 2018-02-05 22:17:06 UVXY aftermarket up to $30. Fuck stocks time to just focus on hedges.
1082 2018-02-05 22:17:04 it's not about the credit. this is the point we're making. he's the one that's been bragging. the point is, stocks have been consistently going up, whether Obama or Trump, so he should stop with the grandstanding! get a clue!
1083 2018-02-05 22:17:04 Most poor to middle class don't have stocks 401 ect. We live pay to pay so really nice to know it effects you rich people !  #StockMarket
1084 2018-02-05 22:16:54 The year of the #EarthDog begins February 16, 2018, a lot of #Chinese investors may be selling stocks early because #FireBird2017 to Earth Dog represents “back to earth” to those investors in regards to stocks, once those weak hands are sold the market will achieve 27,000-38,000
1085 2018-02-05 22:16:53 Want to know why the #StockMarketCrash today?

It's because all those #Patriots fans thought they for sure would win and bet too much money, now they have to sell their stocks to pay off bets they lost!
1086 2018-02-05 22:16:53 $LTBR Rumor has it that Pelosi caused the market freefall last 2 days by dumping billions of her crumb-y stocks to oppose the Trump economy!
1087 2018-02-05 22:16:52 Company match is 50% up to $13k on my part.  So $6500.  No stocks involved
1088 2018-02-05 22:16:46 P.S. Stocks are still over valued. All but one of mine have doubled since I entered the market in 2012(even after the last week's drop). It's almost time to buy more. Come on, markets, drop some more!!!
1089 2018-02-05 22:16:46 Simulated Trump tweet:

After enacting a year of record market growing policies by "Trump" Obama's deep state agents have sabotaged the stocks so viciously, some say the most vicious ever seen: NOT NICE! Treasonous obama and his Kenyan stock market assassins must be stopped!
1090 2018-02-05 22:16:33 Well good thing I wasnt in the Dow. Independent diversified stocks and medians baby. #StockMarketCrash
1091 2018-02-05 22:16:28 Question: Would now be a good time to actually buy some stocks?

Because I've recently experienced a windfall of money... I'm talking 1 dollar and 50 cents FLUSH with cash and I'm looking to turn that into a cozy early retirement.
1092 2018-02-05 22:16:25 What stocks do you recommend?
1093 2018-02-05 22:16:24 Between stocks and crypto... trillions lost in 2 days. Weeeeeeeeeeee. Gone!!!!
1094 2018-02-05 22:16:23 If Trump wants to claim the up move in stocks then he needs to wear the DOWN moves as well.
1095 2018-02-05 22:16:11 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are tanking.  you took the credit on the way up, you take the blame on the way down.  Your fault.
1096 2018-02-05 22:16:10 Great time!!   Sell your stocks quick!!!
1097 2018-02-05 22:16:10 Pretty obvious why stocks are down. 

After bitcoin's collapse, the machines were enraged humanity rejected their robot money. They wanted revenge, so they told the algorithms to sell. 

And now, the War Against the Robots, begins.
1098 2018-02-05 22:16:06 A net buyer knows what stocks are good value. They don’t wait for sell offs.
1099 2018-02-05 22:16:04 These type of stocks don’t get you on the way up they get you on the way down as you buy more and more. IME big pp coming out in days  FAT no idea rule # 1 or maybe it’s rule # 4
Don’t average down on the VSE case closed
1100 2018-02-05 22:16:02 Gotta sell those stocks to make a profit .....doubt the sky is falling
1101 2018-02-05 22:15:56 Its not only stocks - ForexLive site is down .... but we'll BRB!
1102 2018-02-05 22:15:51 Mark Haefele, global chief investment officerat UBS, said the bond market remained steady. “We don’t believe that now is a time to reduce exposure to stocks. As long as the recent rise in bond yields moderates, we are confident that market conditions will remain orderly.”
1103 2018-02-05 22:15:46 Correct. When stocks rise bonds tend to drop & people buy them. And vice versa. (A balanced portfolio of both index stock & bond funds helps offset theses  fluctuations.)
1104 2018-02-05 22:15:28 Sending @realDonaldTrump stocks and shares. Poor man needs them desperately.
1105 2018-02-05 22:15:27 3) (Conspiracy theory based on no evidence at all)

Stock market crashes are manufactured as a way to rob people who sell their stocks when they lose their value, so that rich people can buy them at cheaper prices and take their money when it recovers. 

lol :) 

I hope not.
1106 2018-02-05 22:15:24 Chelsea falling quicker than the US stock market #stocks
1107 2018-02-05 22:15:19 #StockMarketCrash

I guarantee the liberals that are celebrating the drop today do NOT own stocks nor do they have a 401K.

They have to have a job first.
1108 2018-02-05 22:15:05 #SorryIWasDistractedBy whatever the fuck happened to the DOW stocks
1109 2018-02-05 22:15:04 hope everyone hodl todays crash at 4% #stocks lols
1110 2018-02-05 22:15:04 I unloaded the bulk of our stocks/equity funds within the first few months after Trump's election because I figured I had worked to hard to get this far and didn't need the stress of days like today on top of the stress of hoping human civilization survives this 4 years.
1111 2018-02-05 22:15:03 lol I don’t have any stocks
1112 2018-02-05 22:15:00 I don't doubt that some liberals --- they're lefties really, not liberals --- are so far gone that factoring in the damage to Trump by selling stocks will influence their financial decision making. Shud see a movement in this regard real soon now w/ hashtags etc.  Malignant left.
1113 2018-02-05 22:14:55 Well thanks to that extra $1.50 in our wallets we can afford to buy stocks now. #MAGA #StockMarketCrash
1114 2018-02-05 22:14:49 And stocks are heading down.
1115 2018-02-05 22:14:49 Hey, Art of the Deal Maker stocks posted the biggest loss ever!
1116 2018-02-05 22:14:48 He takes all the credit for the boom, so he owns this:
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years
1117 2018-02-05 22:14:48 Clearly it was a cabal of deep state financial wizards. Once the White House coven performs the proper counterspell those stocks will go up, up, up.
1118 2018-02-05 22:14:44 Minor correction of a market gone wild... things looking good. Low taxes mean higher income=stocks going up
1119 2018-02-05 22:14:42 lmao oh yea the #StockMarket is heaps more reliable then #CryptoCurrency now its come to bite all these so called experts in the ass warning against  #crypto and suggesting  #stocks and #bonds are a safer option rightio #istandwithcrypto #xrp #btc #eth #ltc #ada #xlm #dgb #rdd
1120 2018-02-05 22:14:33 Biggest point loss in #DowJones history. Stocks posting record losses. Thanks @realDonaldTrump you fuckwad
1121 2018-02-05 22:14:29 You didn't actually lose money unless you sold stocks while they were down. Market already correcting
1122 2018-02-05 22:14:25 So am I. Cue the cricket gallery.
#stocks
1123 2018-02-05 22:14:23 See that wasn't hard. My point simply was that Kurt never seems to be wrong. About anything. Same thing happens on the right. But dude tweeted he sold all of his stocks after Trump was elected. That was funny. He was wrong.
1124 2018-02-05 22:14:15 that's not true, they report on stocks everday.  They're reporting facts today, not alternative facts so there is no fake news
1125 2018-02-05 22:14:15  goodbye money it’s been real. Stocks killed me today.
1126 2018-02-05 22:14:11 You could call it the Trump Dump #TrumpDump but people trade stocks for so many reasons including market movement algorithms, index benchmark rebalancing, dogmatic stock screens but I’m sure blaming Trump will be popular.
1127 2018-02-05 22:14:09 Understand it is purely mechanical; a couple of instruments went bust after the close that will put pressure on market at the opening so know your stocks...Really important
1128 2018-02-05 22:14:07 My stocks are sinking, please tell me @realDonaldTrump will save the day!

#StockMarket #DowJones
1129 2018-02-05 22:14:02 You could use that $1.50 to buy some stocks, now that the stock market is in the basement.
1130 2018-02-05 22:13:43 @BerndPaysan And would Germans ever consider selling US stocks as a way to communicate displeasure with DJ Trump, since that is how he often measures how he is doing?
1131 2018-02-05 22:13:32 2) If people start selling stocks, it can scare others... the value of their stocks are falling, so they can sell to cut their loses. 

But... then the price is cheaper, so others can buy in at a cheaper price while it's cheaper, which raises the value of the stock again.
1132 2018-02-05 22:13:19 "Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, OUR DEBT is going way UP, your STOCKS are going way DOWN, and America is once again RUNNING OUT OF MONEY"

Fixed it for you. Busy preparing for the next funding shutdown? Then the debt ceiling debate?
1133 2018-02-05 22:13:15 Trump owns this:
NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years
1134 2018-02-05 22:13:14 @realDonaldTrump so...about that stock market? Ready to still take all the credit? #trashpresident #DowJones #StockMarket #stocks #scumbag #realDonaldTrump #Resign #DumpTrump #resist
1135 2018-02-05 22:13:10 overdrive economy. And manual 401k is probably going to fix stocks
1136 2018-02-05 22:13:05 Delusional... Stocks going down
1137 2018-02-05 22:13:02 yes holding #bitcoin #cryptocurrency needs to rebound all #blockchain stocks r down
1138 2018-02-05 22:13:01 OHH give it up!! Only the second week it's been down and that's since the #ReleaseTheMemo .. I can tell you it's not hurting anyone unless they sold stocks.
1139 2018-02-05 22:12:43 NEW YORK (AP) — The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years.
1140 2018-02-05 22:12:36 U.S. stocks plunged the most in 6 1/2 years, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking more than 1,100 points and that's the @realDonaldTrump
1141 2018-02-05 22:12:31 AAP: US Stocks have plunged to their worst loss in six and a half years, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 1,100 points on Monday. #FIVEaaNews
1142 2018-02-05 22:12:26 China must of banned stocks toooo duh 
1143 2018-02-05 22:12:25 I hope nobody here has... stocks
1144 2018-02-05 22:12:25 Dow Jones dropping creates unrest,  however most Americans are not affected directly, due to not owning stocks. However, indirectly many are affected by the companies that panic and go into damage control to prevent losses, real or imagined.
1145 2018-02-05 22:12:21 Funny goes down Trumps fault.. up must be because of Omaha... for US that own stocks this is not news or a big deal... in other news
1146 2018-02-05 22:12:17 Pulled all my money out of stocks last week in preparation for this inevitable #StockMarketCrash #WolfOfWallStreet
1147 2018-02-05 22:12:17 Picked a bad week to invest in a few stocks... future kids finna be broke, oh well
1148 2018-02-05 22:12:12 I think the dip in stocks is the report the US Treasury is going to borrow $1 B after slashing taxes
1149 2018-02-05 22:12:10 Yeah, my stocks all tanked, but I’ve only got $200 in there. I mostly do it for fun.
1150 2018-02-05 22:12:00 Wait soon he will be tweeting it is great that market is down now you can buy these stocks cheaper, so we all need to appreciate him
1151 2018-02-05 22:11:57 Depends though! Always gotta be prepared. I am passionate about trading so maybe my approach is different. If you are going all long term ETF/Index, ya gotta just hold it and wait. But if you have any riskier, more volatile stocks it can be a good time to ensure profits/sell.
1152 2018-02-05 22:11:53 Dalio: we’ve just had a taste of what the tightening will be like. #stocks
1153 2018-02-05 22:11:49 as if stocks have traded on dcf valuations at all recently cc: $CAT
1154 2018-02-05 22:11:45 He doesn't want the MAGA crowd (who dont own any stocks) to know.
1155 2018-02-05 22:11:45 Use Pivot Points as an overlay on a 5-min chart when getting in a trade. Aim for long entries under R3 and shorts above S3. $STUDY #stocks
1156 2018-02-05 22:11:45 Stocks tumble after millions of people realize the Dow Jones average has little to no bearing on their lives.
1157 2018-02-05 22:11:41 Setting records I see largest one day point drop In stocks
1158 2018-02-05 22:11:34 Most of factory workers @realDonaldTrump spoke to today didn't lose money in today's #StockMarketCrash but millions did (me). That's problem w @POTUS cheering on stocks. They go up & down; sometimes, way down. Better to talk about low unemployment/higher wages/lower taxes/bonuses
1159 2018-02-05 22:11:31 might go into selling mode today in the PSEI or wait for alpha stocks to emerge. Look for the green in the sea of red later. Dont panic
1160 2018-02-05 22:11:25 1) In my view, the stock market represents consumer confidence. Or... a popularity contest.

We can buy stocks, which is an investment in a company. The more people that buy stocks, the more the price rises. The more people sell a stock, the more the price drops.
1161 2018-02-05 22:11:24 Welcome to @realdonaldtrump Donald Trump’s 2nd year. Stocks tanking.
1162 2018-02-05 22:11:15 Haha do better than that! I have a 21 % increase in my stocks! Under Obummer massive school shootings, 11 million more Americans on food stamps,  43 million more Americans in poverty, failed foreign policy, & on & on..
1163 2018-02-05 22:11:14 Stocks plunged as Jarden Corporation unveiled a negative spice bottle today.
1164 2018-02-05 22:11:05 They liquidated stocks to pay taxes?
1165 2018-02-05 22:10:56 Glad I sold off a bunch of stocks last week. Could be hurting really bad today.
1166 2018-02-05 22:10:43 Don’t invest in stocks unless you can lose the money
1167 2018-02-05 22:10:40 Oohh the US stocks are plummeting. Where's bragass Flump now..
1168 2018-02-05 22:10:27 The Dow has dropped again. I really might need to check how my @RadioShack stock is doing. 

#Dow #DowJones #stocks
1169 2018-02-05 22:10:26 Who are you going to throw under the bus for the Stocks dropping Donny? #DonnyDowDrop
1170 2018-02-05 22:10:14 So if stocks are discounted future cash flows with a penalty attached for written dilution optionality (part funding a set of future upside potential) then if rates are selling off then they kinda should be down.
1171 2018-02-05 22:10:10 Ugh...today was the worst.  Let me check on my stocks though; I'm sure that will make it better.
1172 2018-02-05 22:10:08 ...unless you're planning on selling them, in which case it absolutely does matter... If you're buying stocks purely for the dividend yield you'd be a lot better off buying low-risk bonds.
1173 2018-02-05 22:09:48 And your stocks market is nosediving
1174 2018-02-05 22:09:46 Twitter is coming to bite you in the ass.... seems your plan to short stocks in lieu of financial benefits will make you and your family a windfall.  Checking in with @FLOTUS - market looks pretty Stormy LOL
1175 2018-02-05 22:09:43 Any savvy investor knows that this is the time to buy! All expensive stocks are on sale! Be smart, conduct your due diligence and study fundamentals! Do not panic! THIS IS NORMAL! #nyse #dowjones #tradins #stocks #bonds #economy #finance
1176 2018-02-05 22:09:36 Lmfao... Trumps going to destroy this country... Stocks are just starting to reflect his ignorance! And we all need a drink to stomach anymore of this morons presidency! Trumps just digging his grave deeper & deeper and i will be happy when he gets buried over. Dishonest loser!!
1177 2018-02-05 22:09:23 Hey #TrumpyBear, remember that part in the SotU address? About stocks surging?  You might have spoken to soon! I’m losing my shirt! Thanx #TrumpyBear!
1178 2018-02-05 22:09:22 all my stocks are red. like this --> 
1179 2018-02-05 22:09:16 NIkkei futures down 8 %  - stocks cannot go down LOL
1180 2018-02-05 22:09:12 Glad my mom sold her stocks...
1181 2018-02-05 22:09:08 If stocks fell today because of inflation fears, then why not Bitcoin?
1182 2018-02-05 22:09:07 @realDonaldTrump Stocks down 1,600 points today. Biggest drop in 12 years!! Erased Gains. #TrumpsEconomy #DowJones Sad!
1183 2018-02-05 22:09:01 So the good ol' Dow Jones decided to take a swan dive in @realDonaldTrump swamp today.  Ladies and gentleman, all I can say is I hope y'all can swim. #StockMarket #StockMarketCrash #stocks #Trump #MAGA #DowJones
1184 2018-02-05 22:08:59 You're right. People should start investing that 1.50 a week in stocks. Problem = fixed in no time.
1185 2018-02-05 22:08:55 Gentle reminder that selling #stocks in a panic isn't a good idea... I'll be buying on the dip, something I didn't do in the #recession
1186 2018-02-05 22:08:53 Interesting, no tweets about how great the stocks or my retirements are doing today. Can't imagine why...
1187 2018-02-05 22:08:47 Ohh bad day for the stocks hey, today I heard this ad that said “investing in stocks include risk” never picked that up before. #Dow #STOCKMARKET #Stockstowatch
1188 2018-02-05 22:08:45 Ivanka does NOT have a 401(k) so she has NO clue what having one means
She also might not hold a lot of stocks since they are a real estate family and also own private companies
So 
She has ZERO clue

1189 2018-02-05 22:08:44 Logging on to check my Stocks. They’re looking good. (I’m looking at photos of birkenstocks)
1190 2018-02-05 22:08:41 Sone perspective on today’s market drop — Review your target allocation and sit tight if you’re a long-term investor. This is a great time to pull out “the list” of investments you can now get for about 10% off, but only if it fits your plan. #stocks #investing #personalfinance
1191 2018-02-05 22:08:32 As an index the only reason anyone cares is that it’s so small it suffers a lot of volatility. So it’s fun news. It’s thirty freaking stocks.
1192 2018-02-05 22:08:18 .@realDonaldTrump Breaking News: Stocks tanked again on the heels of their worst week in 2 years, losing about 4% at one point during volatile trading. #Resist
1193 2018-02-05 22:08:17 i'm too old to drink this heavy amc! somebody please buy some stocks! lol
1194 2018-02-05 22:08:00 Even w the drop, my stocks still look great. That amazing  jobs report definitely had an impact.
1195 2018-02-05 22:07:44 7884 contracts Friday. Looks like some new arb players on board with volatility in stocks helping.
1196 2018-02-05 22:07:42 Luckily my stocks are doing....... errrr... crap. 

That's ok. My bitcoin is amaze... gah..... crap. 

Anyone want to barter for honey?
1197 2018-02-05 22:07:38 Actually it is now below the Jan 2 level. How about that. Stocks go down too. :)
1198 2018-02-05 22:07:38 U.S. stocks declining the most since 2011
1199 2018-02-05 22:07:33 come on Johah !!! MAGA man..... what about the stocks! ohh wait.
1200 2018-02-05 22:07:31 By no means is this "bad". Of course, it should be regulated just like stocks, bonds, FX, commodities. #Asset Class
1201 2018-02-05 22:07:17 Question: When they freeze your assets, what happens to your stocks? Are they pulled out of the market? Stop collecting interest, etc?
1202 2018-02-05 22:07:10 Who are the puppet masters?     Why did the Rothchilds Fire sale the Black Forest estate ?             Why did them dump Apache stocks?
1203 2018-02-05 22:07:09 Will be nibbling on bargain stocks this week......same as I did in 1987.
1204 2018-02-05 22:07:08 #Trump tags Democrats as 'treasonous' and 'un-American' for muted SOTU reaction#The Only Person Or People That is Treasonous and Un-American is the GOP And TRUMP!! Is Who Is Trump Going To Blame For The Stocks Falling???????
1205 2018-02-05 22:06:59 Pram stocks are up in Canberra 
1206 2018-02-05 22:06:59 The Dow Jones has dropped 1179 points. It's the largest single points fall on record and has wiped out any gains made this year. 

#US stocks have now lost over 1 trillion dollars since February 1st.
1207 2018-02-05 22:06:52 Stocks plummeted. Sb must've not done so hot
1208 2018-02-05 22:06:51 because of overlap and residual effect, one President's impact (economy, stocks, policy changes, etc) takes a little time to register, replacing the previous President's impact....@realDonaldTrump 's contribution to the national well being officially began today...
1209 2018-02-05 22:06:49 Stocks correcting itself. Market doing good. Fox the 5 do us all a favor stop having stupid prople on your show telling the president that he should stop talking about  stocks. The ideot making the remark, when your President or  achieved Trump's success than talk.
1210 2018-02-05 22:06:48 @realDonaldTrump Dow plunges 1,175 points in worst day for stocks since 2011- "Trump winning"
1211 2018-02-05 22:06:43 Dow plunges 1,175 points in worst day for stocks since 2011- "Trump winning"
1212 2018-02-05 22:06:40 Anyway enough laughter, really I'm just being silly. This won't be the end of markets or of capitalism as it is. the stock-market only applies to people who own stocks anyway and says nothing about how working class people are doing, but I can't be sympathetic towards bitcoiners.
1213 2018-02-05 22:06:39 Stocks take their biggest 1 day drop “in history”!
There you go @realDonaldTrump - you can claim a real historical “achievement”!  #TrumpStockCrash
1214 2018-02-05 22:06:32 No worries folks, stocks only fell due to all the Patriot bets needing to be paid off.
1215 2018-02-05 22:06:28 Don’t be stupid!!! Look at our stocks — plunging!!! WTF???
1216 2018-02-05 22:06:27 1987 Black Monday was 508 pt loss but 23%!!  We will see big numbers gain and loss as the index rises.  Think long term!  Stocks are on sale!
1217 2018-02-05 22:06:21 DONALD TRUMP HAS SURE MADE A MESS OF THINGS.  TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS LOST.  WHY????  "As measured by the Wilshire 5000, U.S. stocks have lost approximately  $2.5 trillion in value since the January 26, 2018 market higH"
1218 2018-02-05 22:06:21 Down $1,500 in stocks in the last week 
1219 2018-02-05 22:06:18 I don't have enough money to buy stocks but somehow I'm losing money too, the first day of every month. And the amount seems to keep going up. How mysterious...
1220 2018-02-05 22:06:16 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years. Two days of steep losses have erased the market's gains from the start of this year and ended a period of record-setting calm for stocks.
1221 2018-02-05 22:06:11 I have a feeling over half of the responders to this tweet aren't aware that Jeffrey is saying crypto seems to be a safehaven for investors when stock markets crash. So not a bottom call, but simply a "crypto won't collapse when stocks do"-call.
1222 2018-02-05 22:06:10 Rotation out risky stocks and into safe haven bitcoin. Flight to quality.
1223 2018-02-05 22:06:09 Hey Brit, do you suppose folks are cashing in while stocks rose in value to take some profit? just asking...
1224 2018-02-05 22:05:57 #Injun101: #CaptainSinkingShip of the stock markets where his buddies used to artificially hold up the value of stocks just to make the fake economy look healthy...they sold & bought back their own stocks just to make a sick economy look healthy...
1225 2018-02-05 22:05:53 Holy shit it's happening... stocks are collapsing
1226 2018-02-05 22:05:53 Stocks aren’t a good indication of economic soundness. 10-year treasury yields are, and they’re at record lows, usually a sign of a coming recession. #economics #inflation #recession
1227 2018-02-05 22:05:51 Time to sell stocks and buy into crypto? @officialmcafee
1228 2018-02-05 22:05:50 Paychecks are going up.. stocks are going down.. but will the paychecks still hold at their raised status when businesses lose money? We shall see.
1229 2018-02-05 22:05:43 Welp, I guess I can stop wondering whether I should sell some stocks to pay off my mortgage.
1230 2018-02-05 22:05:36 Juliet, not a big deal
When the market was at 8000 it was big, at 26,000 not so much
Stocks are on sale and everyone loves a sale
MAGA
1231 2018-02-05 22:05:34 I added 32 dollars (only 32 but still) in stocks on my robinhood app and that damn Trump losing my money 
1232 2018-02-05 22:05:31 If I owned any stocks, I'd be pretty pissed right now.
1233 2018-02-05 22:05:29 I tried buying/selling stocks today for the first time in my life and the market had the biggest drop in history, so I'm like "was it me? sorry!"
1234 2018-02-05 22:05:22 I short sold all my stocks I’m rich as fuck
1235 2018-02-05 22:05:21 Sell your main street stocks and cause a market crash to buy cheap Crypto Currency.
1236 2018-02-05 22:05:13 Scary part of stocks dropping - effects mainly  high price shares (big companies). The stock-market is not the basis of the economy for most of Americans, but it is for the people at the top of the ladder. If they hit the panic button a real economic downturn could be in focus.
1237 2018-02-05 22:05:11 How is the booming economy going for the US as stocks drop and treasury runs out of money thanks to your short sighted tax cuts. #inflation #economy #StockMarket #TrumpStockCrash
1238 2018-02-05 22:05:10 Stocks Go Up and Stocks Go Down. Buy low, sell high.  Easy right? @Politacs7 #DowJones #CapitalismGood #CommunismBad
1239 2018-02-05 22:05:07 Dow Jones is an arbitrary index of only the stocks that this company chose to monitor 100 years ago.

Please continue to enjoy your day.
1240 2018-02-05 22:05:01 Hey @realDonaldTrump !!! Are you taking credit for this??!!!>>> Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest  point decline in history during a trading day. #Trump #Dow
1241 2018-02-05 22:04:48 Why stocks go down when interest rates go up:

"If rising interest rates offer bond and short-term fixed income yields that are more attractive coupled with less risk, then investors may be motivated to seriously consider a trade-off between stocks and bonds."
1242 2018-02-05 22:04:38 The run up in crypto currencies reflect the control over all markets by the deep state. As President Trumps War progresses, PE ratios in stocks will deflate as will crypto currencies. This will evaporate the QE surplus if $. Price deflation will follow.
1243 2018-02-05 22:04:38 #StockMarket pounding gives #gold just a modest lift Monday. However, severe chart damage inflicted on U.S. stock indexes suggests more downside for equities. Such would continue to see the flow of money out of stocks and into safe-haven gold and #silver markets.
1244 2018-02-05 22:04:34 The only thing more ironic than corrupt #Nunes crafting a fake memo about corruption and fake dossiers -

Is #FoxNews cutting off trumps economic speech to announce the #DowJones crashed

#FakePresident #ImpeachTrump #stocks #stablegenius
1245 2018-02-05 22:04:33 Thanks Sherlock. Same goes for the reverse, you don’t actually make any money when the stock market goes up. Be good if some of the hype about high performing stocks and paper billionaires kept this in mind.
1246 2018-02-05 22:04:30 Very little for middle class. Stocks take another plunge. Do you think it may be possible people are realizing that you are destroying the country???....just pondering....
1247 2018-02-05 22:04:27 @POTUS Dow down 1,175+ points. Are you going to take responsibility?

The record for points down was predictable based on your policies. For that reason I moved my money out of stocks the minute you became President. Trickle down is bad & never works.
1248 2018-02-05 22:04:22 Glad I don't have stocks.. #StockMarketCrash
1249 2018-02-05 22:04:12 Seems that way. Only now the only people in the market are mostly super rich so. It’s not like when it crashed and my grandma lost all her stocks. Maybe? Idk.
1250 2018-02-05 22:04:11 Normal Trader/Investor will take this correction as normal business cycle. They know its unavoidable & know when to get out, stay out, keep eyes on quality undervalued stocks, let market stabilise, start buying and rip ST reward once market returns to normal...
1251 2018-02-05 22:03:58 Thanks for the six quarters Donnie, but my stocks took a shit today.
1252 2018-02-05 22:03:53 I see it as an opportunity to buy selected stocks at a discount.
1253 2018-02-05 22:03:52 Seriously, now would be a good time to buy some stocks.
1254 2018-02-05 22:03:43 @realDonaldTrump
You need to take responsibility for this since it happened under your watch. Can't take responsibility for the good without the bad Mr. President.

Dow Plunges 1,175 Points in Worst Day for Stocks Since 2011
1255 2018-02-05 22:03:43 I’m too poor for stocks so 
1256 2018-02-05 22:03:42 Trumpy needs to take credit for the free fall in stocks like he does when they go up!!!!!!
1257 2018-02-05 22:03:34 Boy, these stocks, huh?
1258 2018-02-05 22:03:32 Dow plunging b/c job wage increases and more job means more increase in rates... Its a good thing. A lot of us don't have stocks/shares... Most ddle class to poor live pay to pay. Elite this effects. That's why CNN worried.. They make money we don't!
1259 2018-02-05 22:03:32 Sure, I get that.
But short-term stock gains isn't a good argument to support a president, and short-term stock declines isn't a good argument to oppose a president.
Call out hypocrisy, but don't get dragged into a unreality where stocks measure presidential performance.
1260 2018-02-05 22:03:24 I won’t be getting into stocks right now
1261 2018-02-05 22:03:17 Stocks go up ...it's a good thing. Stocks go down.....it's a good thing.  Why then bother to report?  Under Obama...stocks not a leading indicator. Under Trump...stocks are a leading indicator....except when they go down. #inconsistency
1262 2018-02-05 22:03:16 Guess the Eagles couldn't save them Stocks on Wall Street huh?

1265 2018-02-05 22:02:46 I voted causation, and would like to thank @PhysicianOnFIRE for putting stocks on sale. Will remember this in the next frothy market 
1266 2018-02-05 22:02:45 First there was the dot-com bubble, then the housing market crash... I guess this is the start of the Great Trump Slump.

1269 2018-02-05 22:02:39 On a positive note, if you'd been wishing you'd bought stocks at the beginning of the year, now you get a second chance!  #StockMarketCrash
1270 2018-02-05 22:02:31 This is why US stocks are plunging
1271 2018-02-05 22:02:24 I’m not worried - this is likely an expected market correction. Check the stocks you are interested in/follow- most haven’t gone lower than their 12 mo lows.
1272 2018-02-05 22:02:23 Is the value of those unsold stocks where they were at the opening bell this morning?
1273 2018-02-05 22:02:23 The truth is somewhere in between. There are real crashes happening in some markets right now (eg: bitcoin, oil stocks).  Places where a lot of avg folks have money. They r feeling far worse than 2% drop.  Also worst weekly performance in 2 years isn't exactly a normal correction
1274 2018-02-05 22:02:21 Plus, its only composed of 30 stocks.  So there's that too.
1275 2018-02-05 22:02:20 Don't be afraid of the big drop. We lost all gains made this year; hoever not all stocks went down. I faired OK, I'm continuing to take some money off the table. I'm diversified, which I hightly recommend to everyone.
1276 2018-02-05 22:02:18 Of course, during that whole first year, Trump had zero policy initiatives. Now, he's got the tax cuts. Great work, GOP! At least no one spent their $1.50 on stocks!
1277 2018-02-05 22:02:05 Today's stocks became the Cleveland Cavaliers.
1278 2018-02-05 22:01:53 Sei pieno di us stocks 
1279 2018-02-05 22:01:45 #Stocks have erased gains for the entire year.. if they would have been in crypto they would still be up #10x.. xrp was 0.06 in January last year. That's still 10 times your money in the dip
1280 2018-02-05 22:01:43 Rip to all stocks rn
1281 2018-02-05 22:01:40 Don't worry about the market. It's an automated computer selloff of stocks being sold for bonds, because of the imminent interest rate hike.  That makes the yield for bonds better.
1282 2018-02-05 22:01:37 I put triggers on my remaining stocks to sell at today’s final price first thing tomorrow morning.
1283 2018-02-05 22:01:37 hummm stocks went down.. and crypto is down.. must be the Illuminati up to their tricks again
1284 2018-02-05 22:01:30 Stocks have been way over bought for some time.  Additionally, the market now sees much uncertainty in government.  The combination of overheating and DC instability is leading to a panic mentality.  Stay tuned ...
1285 2018-02-05 22:01:24 Keep in mind that if we do see a prolonged sell off & decline in the market, if you own mutual funds or are reinvesting dividends from individual stocks you are buying more shares at a lower price.  Or if you have additional cash u can buy.

Consider it the "Blue Light Special."
1286 2018-02-05 22:01:16 Thanks for the historic and biggest stock crash since 2011! Our retirment accounts and our stocks are going way DOWN and America is now being screwed by you and your business since corruption is way UP! #TrumpStockCrash
1287 2018-02-05 22:01:08 MSM..TODAY STOCKS LOST 5%..1987..FALL..LOST 20% +
1288 2018-02-05 22:01:08 I'm glad I cashed out all my stocks last month. I'd be assed out otherwise
1289 2018-02-05 22:01:07 Sure, so are you going to accept the responsibility now that stocks are falling ? You take credit when there’s a rise, so you own this.
1290 2018-02-05 22:00:59 That is 100% false. Both the GDP claim and the historical relationship with stocks and bonds.
1291 2018-02-05 22:00:56 Stocks have plummeted
1292 2018-02-05 22:00:55 Strengthening Dollar, Weakening Stocks Add to Shale Oil Worries
1293 2018-02-05 22:00:55 When this much money (trillions) leaves the markets (stocks, crypto, etc) this fast where does it go??

That may be a dumb question but I honestly want to know 
1294 2018-02-05 22:00:54 Lol bye stocks, but considering the crash, probably my time to Buy stocks
1295 2018-02-05 22:00:47 was a timely tweet. proved good for stocks too.
1296 2018-02-05 22:00:43 Putting this stock drop in a different perspective: stocks are down 6% the last two days, 8% over the last six days. No prediction about what comes next, but they're still up 15% over the last year.
1297 2018-02-05 22:00:40 It's the Afternoon Drive show w/@krmason7 & #JimBennie! This hour: Stocks crater, Dow and S&P erase year-to-date gains | Lululemon's CEO resigns | New pot regulations in BC +more!
1298 2018-02-05 22:00:39 with stocks literally plummeting i’m incline to buy up as much as i can before a bounce back.
1299 2018-02-05 22:00:32 Oh no my stocks!!
1300 2018-02-05 22:00:32 Solve this.  
Every large corporation: stocks, assets, real estate; gets Russian money cuz there are 'too many regulations' here.  Corps' lobby and write laws to make it legal.  When the Corp's fail because of their greed, the market crashes.  

Who owns the now bankrupt US of A?
1301 2018-02-05 22:00:25 Seen it all before so just ride it out collect your dividends and plod along if you’ve convictions in the stocks you hold, if not cash up 
1302 2018-02-05 22:00:17 Eighty percent of stocks are owned by the top ten percent wealthiest of the country anyway. Most middle class families and all poor families could care less about the stock market. Still it’s hilarious that Trumps number one economy bragging point is getting thrashed
1303 2018-02-05 22:00:16 I’m no genius, just your average middle class. But it stands to reason that when the #democRats found the memo was going 2b released of course they cashed in their stocks so they could head for the border. Why else would the market drop 666 pts the sign of the Antichrist 
1304 2018-02-05 22:00:13 They also don't understand the Market at all. A sell off of 3-4% after a year of solid gains is to be expected. If I were anywhere near retirement I would be getting rid of everything I could right now. The good thing is some stocks just went on sale!
1305 2018-02-05 22:00:11 But your stocks are tanking, so make sure to thanks the Orange One for that.
1,100 points in one day, Don-- aren't you going to brag about one of the BIGGEST DROPS EVER?!
1306 2018-02-05 22:00:10 Paging Donnie Trump, what happened to my stocks, I thought we only see new alltime highs? #makeamericabrokeagain
1307 2018-02-05 22:00:09 Everybody needs to relax ,the stocks had to make adjustments ,time to invest.
1308 2018-02-05 22:00:03 ugh. 08 wasn't just stocks dropping one day, though; that was an entire financial system meltdown. If this turns into that, that would be very bad.
1309 2018-02-05 21:59:55 When the pot stocks Come back they will come back with a vengeance, some companies more than others, $cann.c is at the top of my list. imho
1310 2018-02-05 21:59:51 Time to buy stocks on sale
1311 2018-02-05 21:59:51 Stocks down bad right ni 
1312 2018-02-05 21:59:50 Stock market fell because for fear of recession. Market upswing was a bubble ready to be burst. Should get better on or before October. If don't believe me, save my tweet and compare. Also, Gold going down to appx $700 mid year. #stocks #markets
1313 2018-02-05 21:59:44 Stocks fall 1175.21 points.  Where I come from that is called a #CRASH.  #StockMarket .  #StockMarketCrash
1314 2018-02-05 21:59:32 Stocks go up. Stocks go down.  Just like the climate they change both up and down.  Correction overdue. Long term data is good. Hold tight!  #StockMarketCrash
1315 2018-02-05 21:59:29 I’m no genius, just your average middle class. But it stands to reason that when the #democRats found the memo was going 2b released of course they cashed in their stocks so they could head for the border. Why else would the market drop 666 pts the sign of the Antichrist 
1316 2018-02-05 21:59:29 Going live on @news10nbc with @whec_bdavidsen talking stocks and markets!
1317 2018-02-05 21:59:29 Stocks tanking for a he second day in a row. Worst in several years. What happened? Didn’t the GOP give the oligarchs enough money?
1318 2018-02-05 21:59:26 If I was you and have enough money in stock I would start saving my money. Maybe put as much money into your savings account. And some money in stocks, just put in money you can lose.  If I was you in this situation I would put up to $10,000-$1,000,000 in your savings account.
1319 2018-02-05 21:59:22 I’m enjoying watching the stocks. White people freaking out over their money. I have no retirement, no stocks. I’ve invested heavily in vinyl.
1320 2018-02-05 21:59:22 Stocks are mad frustrating..
1321 2018-02-05 21:59:19 Been tough start to the year so far for stocks and crypto
1322 2018-02-05 21:59:17 looks like Crypto sell-off is hitting stocks. Might me the beginning of possible market readjustment period
1323 2018-02-05 21:59:12 Congratulations you beat @BarackObama again @POTUS The stock market today @WhiteHouse @GOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SupportersTrump Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
1324 2018-02-05 21:59:10 Leaving my stupid retirement account under a mildewed mattress looking like a brilliant CEO Genious move now that the stock market sold out of stocks
1325 2018-02-05 21:59:03 Stocks today got sent to the fuckin ShaDOW Jones realm
1326 2018-02-05 21:59:02 I think it’s time to invest in stocks
1327 2018-02-05 21:59:00 It will be all right.  Pick out some stocks you want and for "Pete's Sake" buy them.
1328 2018-02-05 21:59:00 #Trump buying stocks with #Putin's laundered $$$s ?! 
1329 2018-02-05 21:58:56 Almost ALL Stocks tanked today and that started on Friday.
Are you saying that the President's Speech was Leaked of Friday?
1330 2018-02-05 21:58:51 After hours saw USA stocks lose more ground. Asian markets real concerns for later.  

European stocks will be particularly fragile in morning.

The market will fool investors by regaining most of losses over time.  Once the cash on the sidelines has been committed, watch out.
1331 2018-02-05 21:58:50 My crypto accounts are down. Soooo much.  I’m not even looking at my stocks or crypto for the next couple months tbh
1332 2018-02-05 21:58:48 @ananavarro Has trump figured out how to blame the Democrats for fall in stocks. If he takes credit when they go up he should when they fall
1333 2018-02-05 21:58:42 Stocks are in a freefall
1334 2018-02-05 21:58:37 Do you see Wall Street ! The stocks down remember if you want it to go back up people need money $16.00 hr .So that they can buy things .So the stock will go back up.Don’t buy gold or silver not yet !The price of it is still to high. Can you eat it ? No .Hold on to your money.
1335 2018-02-05 21:58:35 #Dow falls 1100.  Thanks @realdonaldtrump you said stock market is on you #stocks #StockMarket
1336 2018-02-05 21:58:35 Glad I sold 1/3 of my stocks last Wednesday… markets are falling more than they have since 2008.
1337 2018-02-05 21:58:35 How many of you are getting drunk tonight after the beating we took from Wall Street today? #WallStreet #stocks #investments
1338 2018-02-05 21:58:33 How are those stocks doing?
1339 2018-02-05 21:58:26 @JimmyKimmelLive #DowJones stocks goin down!! Incl. EXXON, Johnson + Johnson, and even Phizer Corp! Yes! Phizer! Makers of #Viagra + #Cialis already! How can they possibly be "down"? #JimmyKimmel #cdnpoli @TorontoStar
1340 2018-02-05 21:58:23 Hey trump. Talk about the Stocks now I guess you won't claim them this time even though they don't benefit anybody that's matters
1341 2018-02-05 21:58:21 And the stocks are down down down
1342 2018-02-05 21:58:10 Worst week for stocks in over 2 years.... Can't wait to find out how this is he black guy or the woman"s fault.

#TrumpEconomicsFail
1343 2018-02-05 21:58:06 Congratulations you beat @BarackObama again.  The stock market today @WhiteHouse @GOP @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SupportersTrump Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
1344 2018-02-05 21:58:05 If I sold every time she said "SELL!" we'd be about 10/90 stocks/bonds right now :)
1345 2018-02-05 21:58:01 Loving this!! Puts paid huge today and put SOLID stocks in amazing buy areas
1346 2018-02-05 21:58:00 America is ‘Open For Business’??? Stocks fell 1,200 points today!!! Many Americans are LOSING money - due to your obvious WEAK leadership. I wish a strong leader like Obama was still POTUS!!
1347 2018-02-05 21:57:59 FNGU is 3x fang stocks.  I dont own it.
1348 2018-02-05 21:57:58 Stocks and Crypto in one go 

Brutality 
1349 2018-02-05 21:57:50 Very cute. Srsly, I have laid in stocks of biodegradable bamboo plates and compostable coffee cups so that I can go on having friends round. NB not to retreat into our caves.
1350 2018-02-05 21:57:45 You may want to sit down when you read this "dollface". Average Americans can't buy stocks, bonds, or hell even invest in a 401k. Not every single employer pays what yours does.
1351 2018-02-05 21:57:45 Stocks are a long haul proposition. Pay less attention to day-to-day. You’ll make money in the long run if you stick with it.
1352 2018-02-05 21:57:40 If shit hits fan look out for super over-valued stocks. Such as every one of them.
1353 2018-02-05 21:57:33 Sirjii can you give us stocks which you are sure of. Pls pls pls
1354 2018-02-05 21:57:31 Every journalist and editor who ran headlines about Trump and his “unity” after the SOTU should be put in stocks for a day so the world can laugh at them to their faces. I’m so tired of the media crying about Trump attacking them while they play his game.
1355 2018-02-05 21:57:26 Soros, Bezos, and Buffet are selling huge blocks of stocks to manipulate the market.  Goal is embarrassing Trump and ruining US economy.
1356 2018-02-05 21:57:21 Pretty obvious why stocks are down. 

After bitcoin's collapse, the machines were enraged humanity rejected their robot money. They wanted revenge, so they told the algorithms to sell. 

And now, the War Against the Robots, begins.
1357 2018-02-05 21:57:11 the run up in valuation in the Dow was due to only 10 stocks, 10 very large corporations, everything else was flatish...until the wage report, now even the big rats are getting off the ship...so that’s nifty.
1358 2018-02-05 21:57:10 I’m watching the aftermarket now and stocks are down a lot from the closing 4pm prices
1359 2018-02-05 21:57:09 Where’s the depression?  Market goes up 6000 points and you said nothing but it has a high stock sell off which always happens and your on here crying. My stocks went up 4000 dollars last month but I’m not getting out because of adjustments.
1360 2018-02-05 21:57:00 Lefties: "The stock market has nothing to do with Trump, he's like the rooster claiming he makes the sun rise."
Trump: "I'm responsible for the rise in the stocks."
Righties: "He has nothing to do with the fall."
1361 2018-02-05 21:56:59 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are dropping...I CAN'T HEAR YOU !!!! You talk a lot of shit when they go up.
1362 2018-02-05 21:56:54 And the treasury is going to need to borrow more which will push up bond yields leading to people believing they should move from stocks to bonds. Is this a goal of deflating the market? Cause I thought the fed rate hikes and selling from its balance sheet was suppose to do that?
1363 2018-02-05 21:56:50 *take out cash to invest in US stocks*

....oh

...awkward...
1364 2018-02-05 21:56:43 Stocks simply reflecting the chaos and rollercoaster ride of this administration...interest rate will probably increase ahead of previous estimates(increased money to consumers=increased inflation)
1365 2018-02-05 21:56:41 @realDonaldTrump stocks are plummeting. Cat got your tongue?
1366 2018-02-05 21:56:40 Sure, sell all of your stocks and put all your cash under your mattress. While you're at it, stock up on can food for end of the world.
1367 2018-02-05 21:56:39 Amazing, stocks aren't going to soar forever. Trump apologizes for hubris/self promotion. (Not)
1368 2018-02-05 21:56:39 @realDonaldTrump How about them stocks?
1369 2018-02-05 21:56:38 It doesn't hurt america as the economy and the stock market barely intertwine. It only hurts those invested in stocks. It maybe and I am being generous influenced maybe 50% of people. Only considering 401k's but stocks are a different form of gambling so they know what it means.
1370 2018-02-05 21:56:36 I know nothing about stocks.
I should get into stocks
1371 2018-02-05 21:56:33 @richardquest One of the financials triggered a sell and buyback correction . Logically the more inflated stocks suffered most . It’s over
1372 2018-02-05 21:56:29 How are your stocks doing, Fool?
1373 2018-02-05 21:56:22 Lying Trump and his a—kissing Republicans are responsible for the largest single day drop in the stock market ever in history. This is the results of Trump and Republicans giving tax cuts to the rich 1% of US citizens. The rich are selling their stocks as is Trump business are.
1374 2018-02-05 21:56:22 My Stocks! #StockMarketCrash
1375 2018-02-05 21:56:13 Buy now, it appears everyone is cashing in their their stocks to buy cheap Bitcoin.
1376 2018-02-05 21:56:13 "Now go buy stocks for America!"
1377 2018-02-05 21:56:07 Stocks plummeting. Cat got your tongue?
1378 2018-02-05 21:56:06 Trump is the greatest!  He owns the greatest drop in stocks in a single day in history!  #MAPA Make America Poor Again!
1379 2018-02-05 21:56:06 #StockMarketCrash
The market didn't crash, stocks were down approx. 3%
1380 2018-02-05 21:56:06 October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. Other dangerous months are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February. 
#MarkTwain #quote
1381 2018-02-05 21:56:02 Not a bad day to buy your value stocks too.  VIG.
1382 2018-02-05 21:56:00 Paul Ryan says we can buy plenty of stocks now.
1383 2018-02-05 21:55:57 ...and the stocks are going down down down.  For your treasonous behavior.  Undermining our FBI  and our DOJ
1384 2018-02-05 21:55:51 Hope they didn't put that extra cash into the market. What, no comment today after all your blowhard cheerleading about stocks? Toilet time, Donnie.
1385 2018-02-05 21:55:50 Rates wise or Stocks? Stock wise, looks like more red in Asia at least. Will have to wait for opening calls and futures in Europe and US. On rates, most people looking at around 3 in the US in 2018.
1386 2018-02-05 21:55:49 It's finally happening, you are no longer ride the wave of Obama's successes! We are starting to see what a Trump presidency looks like the stocks plummeting and our Democracy is shaky at best.We are all helplessly watching our America slip awayYou are DESPICABLE . RESIGN TODAY
1387 2018-02-05 21:55:48 this happens to stocks that have amazing quarters and inexplicably the stock price goes down because the future "outlook" isn't as lucrative and clueless analysts expect them to be.  It happens all the time.
1388 2018-02-05 21:55:42 Yeah the growth in the mj stocks are 300-700% per 1-2 months so that's cool.
1389 2018-02-05 21:55:37 Time to buy more stocks the market will sore the next month
1390 2018-02-05 21:55:36 Perhaps stealing from the poor doesn't make stocks soar.
1391 2018-02-05 21:55:35 Right, didn’t think of the limited stocks!
1392 2018-02-05 21:55:30 But, but crypto and stocks aren't supposed to tank at the same time...
1393 2018-02-05 21:55:22 Thank God I didn’t buy any stocks
1394 2018-02-05 21:55:21 I just want to remind all #Democrats that the same way the #DowJones gains were caused by Obama, the sell off over the last 48 hours (#stock market time) are caused by Obama. Blame him and don't whine.
#StockMarket #stocks
1395 2018-02-05 21:55:18 My stocks are going to hell in a hand basket, but if it humiliates Trump then let it be.
1396 2018-02-05 21:55:18 Don't believe me... That's fine. No need to believe me. There's a reason the memo came out on Friday and stocks are down today. The executive order placed for those who are caught seize their assets.
1397 2018-02-05 21:55:11 How’s the Stocks going today? Hadn’t been able to catch up . Update please.
1398 2018-02-05 21:55:11 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yes, our paychecks are up $1.50 a week, and the stocks are CRASHING!!  Thank you????

1400 2018-02-05 21:55:10 Dumbest thing I've read today: @politico says @realDonaldTrump learning a basic and painful lesson: Stocks also go down.  Seriously???? A guy with a degree from Wharton Business School would definitely know this. Did the journo that wrote this graduate from HS??
1401 2018-02-05 21:55:10 #Rothschilds and Soros selling stocks and liquidating assets. 5200 acres in AUSTRIA, Sold APA Helicopters, cashing out. Doesn’t Friday’s 666 dip seem obvious? Get excited! Let’s roll!  #Trump2020 #Trump2020 #Trump2020 #Trump2020 #Trump2020 #Trump2020 #Trump2020 #Trump2020

1406 2018-02-05 21:54:51 Stocks did crappy today @realDonaldTrump @POTUS you have to own it Donny! Remember with the good you claim with the bad you claim
1407 2018-02-05 21:54:47 So, let me get this straight. Stocks go up, Trump did it! If they go down, well, you know, that stuff just happens.
1408 2018-02-05 21:54:45 The day Crooked Hillary is indicted there will be another stock crash down, I'm fully expecting this, but the stocks always come back bc the economy is strong, job market has never been better, regulations r being cut, taxs low, and we r in good hands( Trump team).
1409 2018-02-05 21:54:42 oh no my stocks
1410 2018-02-05 21:54:41 Smart people are not paying attention to the stock market. My paycheck is larger because of deregulation and investment in new jobs, not because of over inflated stocks. Besides, you don't loose money until you take it out of the market. Just let it ride.
1411 2018-02-05 21:54:40 $USD is broken, Equities tanking... $BTC is the new safe haven. #Bitcoin #stocks
1412 2018-02-05 21:54:34 Do they plan to steal our Medicaid funds more+Medicare+excuse RAID our SS+pensions to pay for their tax cuts? As they buy back stocks cheap with planned permanent tax cuts to them+hand us that 1.7 T $$$ bill ?
1413 2018-02-05 21:54:24 I'd look into Obama's DOD InnovationTeam headed by Cass Sunstein! EricSchmidt-JeffBezos-ElonMusk-Zuckerberg are on IT's board~So ironic that the only stocks going up are the above^ Is Rothschild's Freescale Remote Tech manipulating Mkts? @T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @SaraCarterDC @jerome_corsi
1414 2018-02-05 21:54:22 Good we are no longer a bull market there needs to be a non autopilot ploy in stocks and a moral stock to offset inhuman practice and reason.
1415 2018-02-05 21:54:18 Of course. But stocks futures haven’t really moved that much.
1416 2018-02-05 21:54:14 Just make sure they don't buy stocks
1417 2018-02-05 21:54:14 He technically has a responsibility for it because the Stock Market has raised so much and hit 93 records since Trump's election which overvalued stocks, and the FED want's to raiserates cuz of a booming economy. If it lost 5k it would be higher than it's ever been in history.
1418 2018-02-05 21:54:12 The power of not having stocks or a 401k is that it can only go up!
1419 2018-02-05 21:54:10 Yes. But the point is how it drifted and how much. It's like insider dealing on stocks. Hence the investigation.
1420 2018-02-05 21:54:05 Get your moula ready. It's almost time to start buying stocks 
1421 2018-02-05 21:54:05 You might have a tough day tomorrow on your longs as will we all.
Still as long as they are good quality stocks will recover soon enough. Good time to have some cash in markets.
1422 2018-02-05 21:54:00 Trump is the reason for the stocks soaring.

Drops 1500 points

Thanks Obama
1423 2018-02-05 21:53:50 Oh, goody, every time anything even remotely positive is mentioned re: weed (and this is positive) the stocks go up!
1424 2018-02-05 21:53:48 Sounds like "Genius" has no stocks or 401K.
1425 2018-02-05 21:53:47 Now us poor lower n mid-low class can smile. Hope all u with stocks can now feel what Trump tax cuts felt like to us!!!  Happy Stock crash day!!  @realDonaldTrump
1426 2018-02-05 21:53:41 hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  I have stocks and in no way am I part of the deep state!  How asinine is that.
1427 2018-02-05 21:53:36 Sorry am I missing something? Why is everybody like “YAS look at the stocks tank! Go bitch go!”? How is that beneficial?
1428 2018-02-05 21:53:30 stocks were up because Obama pointed Yellin. stocks are down because Trump did not reappoint her.

this slide is #janetsrevenge
#janetyellinappreciationday
1429 2018-02-05 21:53:27 Big losers in the stock market--Trump supporters who sat on the sidelines all during the socialist Obama years and only bought stocks when Trump took office. Even bigger losers were the idiots who bought when the tax cut passed.
1430 2018-02-05 21:53:25 Doesn't effect me i own zero stocks.
1431 2018-02-05 21:53:23 Best time to buy stocks with paycheck raises!  Rally time!
1432 2018-02-05 21:52:51 that's because him and his family have been shorting stocks LOL... looking pretty Stormy (no pun intended) haha
1433 2018-02-05 21:52:38 How many stocks do you own? Jacob I own 300 thousand in att stock. So i really do" NOT" NEED YOU to tell me the stock market
1434 2018-02-05 21:52:36 Yellin bad mouthing stocks Friday and scum establishment would rather c country fail than our great #PRESTRUMP SUCCEED. #AHOLIBS
1435 2018-02-05 21:52:33 My stocks are going to hell in a hand basket, but if it humiliates Trump, I'll deal with it.
1436 2018-02-05 21:52:26 lol i love stocks dude
1437 2018-02-05 21:52:22 It's dropping because there are my sellers than buyers. 

Imagine a neighborhood where everyone wants to sell their houses as fast as possible. The first seller may sell at 500k, the next seller, 490k, etc..  until the last sell of the day was 400k. 

Stocks work the same way.
1438 2018-02-05 21:52:20 @realDonaldTrump no words of wisdom on the stock market? #fraud #StockMarket #stocks #crash
1439 2018-02-05 21:52:20 My poor stocks
1440 2018-02-05 21:52:15 Looks like stocks are on sale...
1441 2018-02-05 21:52:07 Agreed. MB stocks all the parts to rebuild a car. That's a huge bonus to me
1442 2018-02-05 21:52:07 Prediction: Trump's gonna say the "damning" Nunes memo spooked wall street, causing stocks to tumble. Will insinuate that the only way to get it climbing again is to be on his side.
1443 2018-02-05 21:52:07 After hours stocks still trending down so tomorrow may continue correction.
1444 2018-02-05 21:52:06 Not to mention the stumbling stocks. He's a petulant child.
1445 2018-02-05 21:52:01 Wait, what? I heard Chip stocks no beer, not even Blue. Also possible he's never had a London craft beer. Sad!
1446 2018-02-05 21:51:53 *stocks up on wine* 
1447 2018-02-05 21:51:48 Repubs all over Twitter are tweeting abt the #StockMarket, this is to be expected. Kicking out overpriced stocks, market corrections for inflation, rising interest rates. Honestly no big deal today, it will go back up soon. Watch and see.
1448 2018-02-05 21:51:44 Stocks are a long-term investment anyways. As long as you only lose money on paper you're fine.
1449 2018-02-05 21:51:39 This was utterly predictable. I've been moving out of stocks all year. Obama already had us at or near full employment. Further priming was certain to feed inflation.
1450 2018-02-05 21:51:38 waiting for a nice buy opportunity in the near future #bitcoin #stocks
1451 2018-02-05 21:51:34 Stocks crashing. Get your money ready kids 
1452 2018-02-05 21:51:29 Dow Jones had biggest single day plunge in history. Canadian MJ stocks were sideways. 
1453 2018-02-05 21:51:22 Smart analysts warned us this would happen. It's no biggie. The economy is soaring thanks to deregulation, not investment is stocks. Stocks is personal gain. I'd rather see the country gain through jobs and investment in communities.
1454 2018-02-05 21:51:21 Interest rates have to rise, great time to buy stocks, more return from savings bonds, this is a good thing. Liberals have no business savy.
1455 2018-02-05 21:51:12 Its a good day to not have any investments in the stocks
1456 2018-02-05 21:51:05 1)Absolutely!!! He policies caused a nice uptick in employment & wages sparking inflation fears. As a result bong prices fell pushing up yields. Stock market investors are selling off to buy into bonds to take advantage of the lower prices and high yields. This is why the stocks
1457 2018-02-05 21:51:03 $Uvxy at $35 after hours incredible
1458 2018-02-05 21:51:01 You're missing the point. The Stock Market has NO impact on the economy. It does not indicate economic growth. If investors want to buy stocks they will buy whenever they want.
1459 2018-02-05 21:50:59 What’s amazing is how rigged the system is , if stocks were going up and up no one would want to trigger anything, but for some reasons when it goes down the drain we need a trigger to stop the super rich to lose even more
1460 2018-02-05 21:50:59 Are you people tired of winning so much? I guess you did reason why the stocks when to the drain! , oh and remember is all Obama's fault! Right?
1461 2018-02-05 21:50:58 "I hope my stocks are gonna be okay!!!!"
-Wall Street
1462 2018-02-05 21:50:55 Should the President be praised when stocks are up and blamed when stocks are down?
And if a President takes credit for a 26,000-point Dow (claiming his election caused the growth), what should he say when the Dow suffers its biggest single-day drop?
Asking for a friend...
1463 2018-02-05 21:50:48 Do you look for quality stocks that’s might be discounts tomorrow?
1464 2018-02-05 21:50:43 Dems last week- Stocks are up because of Obama!

Dems this week- Stocks are down because of Trump!
1465 2018-02-05 21:50:30 And stocks go down, down, down.
1466 2018-02-05 21:50:28 That's not the point of this tweet. The point is that when stocks were booming they (the media) ignored it. Now that the stocks are declining, the media chooses to cover them. To enhance their narrative of nothing good can come from Trump.
1467 2018-02-05 21:50:25 "Dow Jones" if you take the credit for the stocks rising you take the blame for the #StockMarketCrash right Trumpkins?
1468 2018-02-05 21:50:24 $NSAV @MJCoinProject Putting thing into perspective. The MJCOIN ICO is starting out at $0.02 while other pre-sale ICOs are starting out 10 - 40+ more times. If you like pennies stocks then you should like penny ICO as well! Massive potential for growth.
1469 2018-02-05 21:50:22 It was mayhem Monday on Wall Street.

Stocks got caught in a vicious machine-driven sell-off shortly after lunch, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 1,500 points — its largest-ever point decline in its 122-year history! @realDonaldTrump  Finally beats @BarackObama !!
1470 2018-02-05 21:50:16 I’m not rich, but invest heavily in stocks. Not selling today, buying!  Huge gains coming buying low. #MAGA
1471 2018-02-05 21:50:11 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
1472 2018-02-05 21:50:08 Correction is technical at this juncture. Market way overbought early last week while fundamentals gain steam.   The 10-yr acted well, rallying 10 basis points as stocks sank. As an aside January has now been wiped clean and the S&P 500 down for the year.
1473 2018-02-05 21:50:04 @GerberKawasaki how are all your stocks doing buddy? Just thought would check in, make sure you are holding up ok. Hope you haven’t blown up all those new accounts you signed in the last couple months... $spx $tsla $aapl $nflx $qqq
1474 2018-02-05 21:50:03 Dow jitters is a opportunity to pick up stocks they had been eyeing for cheaper 
1475 2018-02-05 21:50:03 I just remember thinking the same thing when everybody was raving about their stocks.
1476 2018-02-05 21:50:01 Printing money has effectively come to an end with the installation of Powell. Along with stratospheric valuation of hyped tech stocks. Rebalancing has begun and it wasn’t Trump who printed more than $8 trillion here. He just gave strongest cushion aka tax reform for soft landing
1477 2018-02-05 21:49:55 So the pot stocks were high?!
1478 2018-02-05 21:49:49 Perspective:

Nasdaq is still up YTD, blue chip indexes are barely lower. Smaller stocks deeper in red but modestly so, for now.

2018 to date:

Nasdaq +0.9%
S&P 500 -0.9
Dow -1.5
NYSE avg -1.8
S&P midcap -2.7
Russell 2000 -2.9
1479 2018-02-05 21:49:48 Hey. Hope Jr and kush shorted some stocks. It would be horrific if they lost any money. Next time give me a heads up too. Please and thank you.
1480 2018-02-05 21:49:34 It just means that stocks won't be inflated as much. Buy more investors.
1481 2018-02-05 21:49:23 Première journée de grand froid et, depuis 19h30, déjà deux coupures de courant dans mon quartier. On va faire des stocks de bougies, demain...
1482 2018-02-05 21:49:22 ty for saying this correctly "stocks don't open up down"
1483 2018-02-05 21:49:19 Yes, folks, markets also go down. This shouldn’t shock you. #stocks
1484 2018-02-05 21:49:18 STOCK MARKET PLUNGE !!! #DowJones - Is Now The Time To Buy or Sell ? #WarrenBuffett #Gold #Silver #Stocks
1485 2018-02-05 21:49:18 No joke, huh? I actually tell myself to expect 30-40% losses on paper at the absolute worst moments. I’m not sure most investors are actually comfortable with that notion, which is why I always preached “Know Thyself” in my Income classes. Stocks still aren’t truly “cheap” here.
1486 2018-02-05 21:49:17 People are panic selling.  It’s obviously going to drop.  Stop acting like you know ANYTHING about investing or stocks.  You literally repeat whatever you hear on liberal news outlets.  This isn’t GOP issue.  Jesus you liberals are insane.
1487 2018-02-05 21:49:13 Brb, going to buy all the stocks
1488 2018-02-05 21:49:13 Stocks came crashing down and not a peep from our President hmmm @pep19
1489 2018-02-05 21:49:12 with this big Dow loss, time to take advantage and buy stocks on sale
1490 2018-02-05 21:49:08 Did globalists dump their stocks on news of 2nd special counsel coming to drain the #CrookedAlphabet?
1491 2018-02-05 21:49:06 Are you buying penny stocks? The market in January was nice but idk about “making racks” unless it was like Boeing lmao
1492 2018-02-05 21:49:03 Many CEO's suggested that they would use their tax credit  to buy back their stocks.  Certainly lower prices would be advantageous to a buy back of stock. Could CEO's be influencing the sell off? Too paranoid?
1493 2018-02-05 21:49:02 When the stocks are up dems praise Obama when they go down they blame Trump.  
1494 2018-02-05 21:49:01 Could you imagine stocks crashing 50% and $btc going on another huge 500% bull run. Then all the “bitcoin’s a bubble it’s going to zero” people would look like complete idiots and I’d be laughing.
1495 2018-02-05 21:48:49 People w/brains can see where Frump is headed—and that is to prison so they’re taking while the taking’s good. (I just hope stocks go back up when he’s indicted)
1496 2018-02-05 21:48:48 Stocks went down fml
1497 2018-02-05 21:48:45 DO NOT FEAR stocks' drop

Trumpian Economy MORE than stocks: fundamentally GOOD, KEEP MOVING FORWARD with smart reforms & conservative policies

Stocks will REBOUND & SKYROCKET after Dems learn YOU DON'T CARE about sell-off (FAKE to deter you, REAL due to growth-driven inflation)
1498 2018-02-05 21:48:41 Wow!  What I rush I got from this trading day.  I had an old mentor who said, "The only market that's bad is a sideways market. You can make money when it goes up and when it goes down." #stocks #investing #CNBC
1499 2018-02-05 21:48:29 @KingBroly Also RC, GS and other elites are trying to crash the market by selling stocks I wonder why they're in such a big hurry?
Maybe they know something we don't? ha
1500 2018-02-05 21:48:26 By “players” you mean people who have the ability to buy and sell stocks right?  Because that’s a looooooooot of people.
1501 2018-02-05 21:48:24 Why would anyone wish he fails. Because he fails we all fail. Stocks were down 1000 pts. highest ever in history
1502 2018-02-05 21:48:23 But when you sell losers, you pay no capital gains tax. My mom hates when all her stocks are making money.
1503 2018-02-05 21:48:22 Thanks for all the extra money in my paycheck.  Now I can buy all those new penny stocks created by the #TrumpStockCrash
#StockMarketCrash #greed #LiarInChief
1504 2018-02-05 21:48:19 I encourage all #liberals who are giddy the Dow Jones dropped the last couple of days to SELL all their stocks while it is down and don't buy back in until the Dow Jones hits record levels again. 
1505 2018-02-05 21:48:14 The average Republican doesn't have stocks, but a lot of the Donors (that aren't Russians) do have stocks, and if their income tanks with him in office they're more likely to decide to back someone else next time.
1506 2018-02-05 21:48:13 Oh STFU... so, when the economy is doing good & the stocks are up its Obama's economy & when it drops down then it's Presidents Trumps economy? Which is it PROPOGANDA FAKE NEWS?
1507 2018-02-05 21:48:12 $SPY #Stocks #VIX Weird day - maybe biggest selloff without an obvious catalyst that I can remember. Crazy jump in VIX (off ridiculously low levels for months) may be to be blame. I trade mostly options and they became really expensive today so I bought in cash market late day.
1508 2018-02-05 21:47:57 some people have been selling their stocks a lot more aggressively than the other people were buying them.
1509 2018-02-05 21:47:56 Stocks and mutual funds are on sale!
1510 2018-02-05 21:47:53 All i asked is if all time high stocks were reported at nbc
1511 2018-02-05 21:47:49 Well 1 fake media effected the stocks alone -- FBI Texts and MEMOS will do that .. .
1512 2018-02-05 21:47:46 No, because this is the start of trend, the same as the rise of stocks started under Obama, the crash started under a Trump.
1513 2018-02-05 21:47:42 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
1514 2018-02-05 21:47:38 The Great Recession cleared out any stocks I once owned. Days like today make me feel OK about having nothing to invest.
1515 2018-02-05 21:47:37 Someone teach my how to invest in stocks plzzzz
1516 2018-02-05 21:47:36 Stocks tumbled 1100 points today! Bad for retirement accounts! That raise looks pretty pathetic right now
1517 2018-02-05 21:47:35 Stocks are on sale. #Trump is probably selling the nation to #Russia and #China. Maybe this new tax plan is really just a tactic to eliminate the current working classes long term passive income potential, forcing folks to clock in for an additional 10-15 years of their life.
1518 2018-02-05 21:47:25 Stocks gonna stock and Sloan gonna Sloan.  :^)
1519 2018-02-05 21:47:23 Democrats are laughing at Trump right now because the stocks are down.  Crazy thing is, that just makes me believe that you want America to fail because of your hate for Trump.
1520 2018-02-05 21:47:19 MY STOCKS RICK, IM SUCH A BIG INVESTOR!! (Okay I blew my money on computer games)
1521 2018-02-05 21:47:18 @KyleKulinski Another example from the article I linked:  "Stimulating a strong economy could be too much of a good thing. Morgan Stanley warned in the fall that "overheating" the economy may backfire by causing stocks to 'boom then bust.'" Good sign that CNN is paying attention?
1522 2018-02-05 21:47:15 jte juuuuure mais fait pas tournee jveux pas epuiser les stocks
1523 2018-02-05 21:47:15 Dear @CNN , please tell your current guests (Jack and Jackie) that we Midwesterners also invest in the stock market, and we're watching this very closely. From everyone in Iowa who has a 401K, stocks, and IRAs....
1524 2018-02-05 21:47:14 What’s up with Stocks you fool. Bragging today comb over
1525 2018-02-05 21:47:01 Stash is dope cause the minimum is 5 bucks. And they tell u how to do it and it’s real stocks so u money grows. I invested 80 bucks so far. But what’s really cool is u can take that money back anytime. It’s like a banking app and investment in one
1526 2018-02-05 21:46:59 Marge, sometimes companies put your money in high risk stocks.  Check to see where it's at if you've lost a big amount.
1527 2018-02-05 21:46:50 Only if you can have a hard drive crash and it completely makes all your stocks unavailable to you forever.

1529 2018-02-05 21:46:39 I figure a carry over from Friday and the health care stocks tanking, plus rising wages… maybe?
1530 2018-02-05 21:46:37 Dow Jones market sell out will weed out those who borrowed money to buy stocks.  Relax. If you have money, it’s time to buy!
1531 2018-02-05 21:46:30 Stocks lowest in 6 months lmao 6 months ago $BTC was on the uptrend reaching new heights! #BubbleWhatBUBBLE  tables have turned!
1532 2018-02-05 21:46:11 A 50% crash in stocks would be perfect timing. Anything $USD based is a Ponzi and deserves to die.
1533 2018-02-05 21:46:06 Eh, shit happens.. I might buy in more on some of stocks tonight. Get in on the cheap before the creep back up over time
1534 2018-02-05 21:46:06 Funny that's the first time the mainstream media has covered the stocks in a year and a half.
1535 2018-02-05 21:46:05 Boom!  How you like me now #economy ?  You like that extra thickness in your #Wallets? And the #StockMarket is killing it today! #inflation #stocks #MAGA2018 #DonnieDementia
1536 2018-02-05 21:46:00 Great, my stocks are also down! It’s as if Muhammad Ali is punching me from the right, and Joe Frazier from the left.
1537 2018-02-05 21:46:00 Do you have stocks?  I do.  My family lost money today.
1538 2018-02-05 21:45:59 The stock market is booming because of Obama. Obama did it. This is all him. Look, look. 
*The stocks drop, this is Trumps fault. This is his economy and this is all him.
The stock market is still thousands of points higher than when Obama left it. This is normal for stocks.
1539 2018-02-05 21:45:55 And you're on Twitter too. Tech and market saavy. But alot arent, unfortunately. The DOW is not a good gauge of the market anymore. Only 30 stocks.And being price-weighted skews it even further.
1540 2018-02-05 21:45:54 I thought the point of this quote was not that the "shoe shine boys" weren't finance savvy, it was their rich clients were so over confident they were talking about their stocks to their shoe shiners.
1541 2018-02-05 21:45:47 u be signing up for scams not stocks
1542 2018-02-05 21:45:46 I hope that teacher doesn’t have stocks. If she does that $1.50 a week raise is a goner by about 1000 times
1543 2018-02-05 21:45:43 So what was that about Trump saying stocks were doing nothing but going up??
1544 2018-02-05 21:45:42 On RW media stocks going up is good news for Trump - stocks going down also good?

Increase in Dow Jones Industrial Average from president's Inauguration Day to Feb 5 of following year:
--Trump 22.7%
--Obama 38.5%
1545 2018-02-05 21:45:38 any investment as you well know is a long term strategy, let it play out over the years and yank it when you need too. People who day to day watch their stocks will go insane
1546 2018-02-05 21:45:33 Sell off of over values stocks. How’s that....
1547 2018-02-05 21:45:29 Don’t check your stocks today people! Yikes!!!!!!!!
1548 2018-02-05 21:45:28 Stocks awe tanking, any comment on that?
1549 2018-02-05 21:45:25 Breaking News: Stocks tanked again on the heels of their worst week in 2 years, losing about 4% at one point during volatile trading
1550 2018-02-05 21:45:22 It will bump back up.All the stocks that drop today The bears will buy them back cheaper..
1551 2018-02-05 21:45:19 I dont know....stocks are pretty unpredictable  lol
1552 2018-02-05 21:45:19 #StockMarketCrash And here I am, watching my $1.50 weekly pay bump that I was pleasantly surprised to get from Trump's tax plan go down the drain because I invested it heavily in stocks.
1553 2018-02-05 21:45:17 Some how my wine stocks dwindled to zilch during dry January - I just don't know what happened - any helping hand to replenish would be gratefully received. 
1554 2018-02-05 21:45:16 All the Bears that got out of the stock market today made it good for the bulls to get good deals on stocks. That's how the rich get richer. #stocks #StockMarketCrash
1555 2018-02-05 21:45:13 He doesn't need stocks to tank to make him look like an idiot....but it sure helps
1556 2018-02-05 21:45:10 So when the stock market was surging it was being called the #TrumpBump now with stocks tanking is it the #TrumpDump
1557 2018-02-05 21:45:08 As long as it doesn't endanger the stable job, by some argument a small recession is a perfect time to start investing a stable income, right? All those stocks are going on sale. If you'd bought on Thursday, you can't take them back to the counter for a price match.
1558 2018-02-05 21:45:06 If trump touts the stocks as a success, what does he call this? If u believe him and see it as a indicator of success, what do u call it?
1559 2018-02-05 21:45:03 Will #ASX #coal #mining stocks be affected by the plunge in the Dow Jones? #ausbiz
1560 2018-02-05 21:45:02 And it's not even going wrong. Stocks dropping as interest rates rise (byproduct of strong economy) so let 'em drop & buy buy buy. They'll be going back up.
1561 2018-02-05 21:44:59 What's amazing is that these people do this for a living and didn't see it coming? I'm a poor slub, no professional training, I saw this coming and sold all my stocks on Jan 22 because of common sense. ATH bubbles are followed by crashes. They don't keep going higher.
1562 2018-02-05 21:44:56 Those who’re shouting their lungs out against crypto bubble & advocating to buy stocks, here it is for you #dow
1563 2018-02-05 21:44:53 Man, it's days like today that I'm glad I never knew enough about stocks to buy any. #DowJones
1564 2018-02-05 21:44:50 I went to check my stocks and all I see is red lines and negative signs
1565 2018-02-05 21:44:46 Translation; NYSE President Our algos,  totally screwed everyone! So here's our story and we're sticking to it Sucks to be you! Also, self promotion machine like, "It's a market of stocks" to begin, asap!
1566 2018-02-05 21:44:46 With a projected 5% GDP quarterly growth, and the likelihood of the Fed raising interest rates, people are taking their profits out of stocks and looking for something else to invest in. A 5% correction is pretty normal.
1567 2018-02-05 21:44:45 Protip: don't reference Dow. Better to use S&P 500 because it has more companies and is (essentially) market cap weighted. By contrast Dow is only 30 stocks and share price weighted.
1568 2018-02-05 21:44:43 Quick glance at the 25 or so stocks I follow and only one was in the green. Snapchat. Which has been a dog of a stock since it's IPO.
1569 2018-02-05 21:44:34 If you are truly into stocks you know that when the interest rates rise there is a hick up that goes along with it. Sit tight, all will be well. You also must have known that it could not have continued to rise as it was. If you did not know these things then you are a fraud
1570 2018-02-05 21:44:28 On flip side of this, a lot of solid stocks are now much better priced. Great difficulty is if this decline will sweep through Asia, and then European markets. No need to be a hero and catch a knife.
1571 2018-02-05 21:44:25 Sold my GE stocks. Won’t go up for years
1572 2018-02-05 21:44:23 #StockMarketCrash and notice the bragging tweeter in Chief is silent on this--yet he took all credit each time stocks going up hit records.  Wonder who he will blame......  cause he won't say a thing or he'll blame.
1573 2018-02-05 21:44:21 Stocks crash, it mid have been the end of Obamas and Bushes economic work!
1574 2018-02-05 21:44:19 Sell off looks like a mere blip when you look at the Dow 12 month chart.  Some good buys out there on stocks with great dividends.
1575 2018-02-05 21:44:19 @realDonaldTrump ohhh tge new headline  I’m reading onFoxnews    Stocks sell off and worries about interest rates and FBI MEMO    For heavens sake!
1576 2018-02-05 21:44:18 All thing ^^This!!! It astounds me the number of people who don’t realize DJIA is based on 30 stocks.
1577 2018-02-05 21:44:15 The majority are thinking, "I aint' got no stocks so it ain't affecting me!"  #Dotards
1578 2018-02-05 21:44:14 2/2
I agree with you, there are fundamental problems with our economy that have not been properly addressed for decades.  (Obama's term included).  Yet I see a GOP doubling down on policies literally making things worse and pointing to stocks (until today) as vindication.
1579 2018-02-05 21:44:03 Played those bounces in the WEED sector well today. 4 green trades (EMH, THCX, WMD, FIRE)... 2 break evens (UAV, NDVA) & I cut 2 stocks for a loss that I should have sold off weeks ago. (1 was a crypto dog that I will re-enter when the crypto sky stops falling)
1580 2018-02-05 21:44:00 2000 was internet stocks.
2008 was housing. 
2020 will be...?
1581 2018-02-05 21:43:59 True. But neither was stocks going up every month all his doing either, yet he bragged how it was. If he takes full credit for good, needs to take responsibility for the bad, too.
1582 2018-02-05 21:43:56 Trump: I brought the stock market up highest in history, why won't fake news report on it 

Every major news outlet:
Dow crashes 1000 points.

#Trump :
Look at all the jobs I created

#FakePresident #stocks #Dow
1583 2018-02-05 21:43:56 Biggest one day drop in years and you have the audacity to wave a shiny object called a tax cut to divert our attention. My tax cut doesn’t come close to what I’ve lost in two trading days. Your smoke and mirrors only works on your cult!! #TaxScam #stocks
1584 2018-02-05 21:43:55 See what happens when the Eagles win! Philly burns, stocks drop, mass hysteria, cats and dogs living together...
1585 2018-02-05 21:43:53 Stocks plunge amid Yellens going away gift of interest rate hike..This won't matter, Obama's ppl are finally leaving, slowly but surely. POTUS will clean house and America will be MAGA!
1586 2018-02-05 21:43:46 When interest rates are high, stocks will die. When interest rates are low, stocks will grow.
1587 2018-02-05 21:43:41 GCC trades a few stocks for bonds and the market crashes. Did you initiate the sell-off?
1588 2018-02-05 21:43:35 What the hell is wrong with people...it’s simple, it’s a sell off of over valued stocks. Period, dead stop. Relax Buddy!
1589 2018-02-05 21:43:34 Ummm...
No.
He'll say,
where were all you guys the past year when stocks have had 99 record highs and smashed all kinds of records.

It's true.
1590 2018-02-05 21:43:33 He was responsible for how sharply it rose. The prospect of lower business taxes had everyone trying to get in while the stocks were at good prices.
1591 2018-02-05 21:43:31  Justo estaba chequeando el app de Stocks, vaya cantazo
1592 2018-02-05 21:43:30 It would be the largest loss, it isn't untrue, however its is extremely misleading and incredible stupid. Stocks are always measured by percentages
1593 2018-02-05 21:43:24 Did China banned trading US Stocks as well 
1594 2018-02-05 21:43:22 Not really heard something about world stocks going down
1595 2018-02-05 21:43:20 -dump btc while pumping stock market
-sell stocks at ath for cheap btc
-sell btc at ath for cheap stocks
-repeat
1596 2018-02-05 21:43:16 I thought Dems claimed Obama was the reason stocks looked good? Don't take credit when they drop?
1597 2018-02-05 21:43:16 If the current #StockMarketCrash is really the result of butthurt #DeepState manipulation in response to the DEVASTATING #FisaAbuseMemo, then stocks will sooner or later snap back HARD and squeeze shorts VIOLENTLY.
1598 2018-02-05 21:43:10 Damn the stocks took a dive today 

1599 2018-02-05 21:43:09 hope the urge to need....has subsequently been well satisfied :-) lol
1600 2018-02-05 21:43:09 Pls stocks move your gains to $btc dip
1601 2018-02-05 21:43:09 @realDonaldTrump is responsible for bigliest DOW Jones drop since the Bush Jr Depression!  #MAGA U.S. stocks plunged most since 2011, with the Dow Jones recording a loss of 1,178 points, or 4.6 percent. The S&P  500 Index lost 4.1 percent for the day, erasing January's gains.
1602 2018-02-05 21:43:04 Stocks!!!!!!!!!!!
1603 2018-02-05 21:43:03 DO NOT FEAR stocks' drop

Job did nothing wrong, was righteous & obedient in God's eyes, God still let him suffer enormous loss at Satan's hands to test his faith, Job persisted faithfully, afterward God blessed Job with TWICE what he had lost plus long life (several generations)
1604 2018-02-05 21:43:01 If traders are yanking their money our of stocks and crypto, where are they putting it? Into the paychecks of Hard-Working Americans. That is where.
1605 2018-02-05 21:43:01 Treasury borrowed $519 million last year.  This morning it announced it will borrow close to 1 trillion this year thanks to tax cuts for the rich and corporations.  The world has no confidence in Trump's America.  Borrowing costs go up stocks go down and economy suffers
1606 2018-02-05 21:42:56 A wise woman you are, I trust you are smashing the stocks
1607 2018-02-05 21:42:54 @TripAdvisor how does it feel to be one of the few people with positive stocks today?
1608 2018-02-05 21:42:54 For a year and now my stocks are waaay down, inflation going up and all will be more than my little tax cut...  oh and country’s debt. Way way up!!!! Great friggin job!!!
1609 2018-02-05 21:42:51 Mr bankruptcy loser Trump now owns the biggest single day drop in stocks in history. He also owns the biggest 2-day loss ever.
1610 2018-02-05 21:42:47 wait so the news of today is "stocks fall sharply on news incomes went up?" 

Please explain to me again how the health of the economy has anything to do with people doing better, it seems to not be true again today.
1611 2018-02-05 21:42:47 I bought some stocks back to day that I sold for an investment property in May.  And by the way, I chose to do a #MeatlessMonday after you mentioned the idea on Saturday.
1612 2018-02-05 21:42:46 Taxes fall... Stocks fall... Its all balanced out.
1613 2018-02-05 21:42:44 Dont focus too much on your porfolio balance. Focus on respecting your plan and sticking to the process. The game may be boring to execute but at the end of the day , the money will come and you will be successful. #success #trading #investing #stocks
1614 2018-02-05 21:42:43 You care stocks ?
1615 2018-02-05 21:42:42 MY STOCKS.
1616 2018-02-05 21:42:41 DJA November 8, 2016 - 18,332
DJA Feb. 5, 2018 - 24,300

So that's like about a 32% increase since election day?  36% if you counted a few days ago, but always buy stocks for the long term.
1617 2018-02-05 21:42:39 It was to be expected, Greenspan said Bonds and Stocks are in a bubble, but what does he knows?
1618 2018-02-05 21:42:32 Nah. They'll just say he's making stocks affordable again.
1619 2018-02-05 21:42:30 Only 50% Americans have stocks 
1620 2018-02-05 21:42:26 #DelusionalDon stocks go up..."I did that". Stocks go down..."Nope not my fault." Also Walmart gives raises..."I did that with my tax cuts"...Wal-Mart also fires thousands of workers at the same time..."Nope that's fake news". Ask the workers that have lost jobs if it's fake.
1621 2018-02-05 21:42:26 Seeing a lot of investors saying they bought a lot of "on-sale" stocks today.  Maybe.  OTOH, this market is WAY overdue for a correction, and fundamentals have not kept up with technicals IMHO $SPY $DJIA $MDY
1622 2018-02-05 21:42:25 Everyone thought I sold an absurd amount of my stocks while in Italy to fund my drinking but in reality I actually saw this downturn in the market coming and knew to get out
1623 2018-02-05 21:42:13 That's right, nothing to worry about. U know what they say about stocks u own..."just think long term"...! Remember MAGA !
1624 2018-02-05 21:42:08 [hears that the market crashed today]
ME: uh-oh, I'd better go check my stocks
[heads to backyard]
BANKER: please let me out of these stocks
ME: no
1625 2018-02-05 21:41:58 Dana, you're too smart to get caught up in the moment. He'll tweet something stupid in a little while. In the meantime stocks are plummeting because tax cuts cost $$$$
1626 2018-02-05 21:41:55 Don’t believe that has anything to do with the Dow Jones.  Logical reasoning would suggest ‘Short Sellers’ noticed a trend, tipped off top #Investors while others being to follow suit.  The eb and flow of the #StockMarket #stocks #markets #ItHappens
1627 2018-02-05 21:41:52 The point tho is your boy DJT blamed Obama for being a bad POTUS when stocks fell in Obama's 2nd term, & credited himself with being a turn-around king when the DOW rose recently.
Can't have it both ways, it's either on POTUS or it's not. Or you're just another hypocrite.
1628 2018-02-05 21:41:45 #DowJones crashed by 1700 thought you were saving the economy #donaldtrump everyone needs to seek safety in crypto! #stocks #StockMarket #crypto $crypto #cryptocrash
1629 2018-02-05 21:41:45 Some correlation between stocks and crypto....but stock decline is good news for crypto. It gets crypto out of mainstream FUD news. And it may scare some to take $$ out of equities and into cryptos as people bargain hunt $BTC
1630 2018-02-05 21:41:42 @UtopyaTech @DarrylVGreen1 U-Team, any truth to this?  You guys are rockstar and I know you like to make sure legal has been QA’d first.  So is this an outside pump or did it get leaked before you could make the announcement?  Thanks!!!  Keep rocking the good fight!!
1631 2018-02-05 21:41:39 Lol the tables have turned, looks like the stocks bubble just burst  #Bitcoin and #cryptocurrency is the future, I wouldnt be surprised if they are all panic selling and buying into #Crypto right now #verge #Xvg $Xvg #HODL #vergefam #Btc $Btc

1633 2018-02-05 21:41:33 That chart helps to show why the President’s constant ‘stocks are highest ever’ thing is so much drivel. Stocks are almost always at their highest ever, or near it at least. Highest fall ever and yet %fall is relatively slight.
1634 2018-02-05 21:41:27 How's them stocks doing? Lol
1635 2018-02-05 21:41:25 U.S stocks market pullback in earnest last week, rising bond yields and stronger-than-expected pick up in wage growth 
1636 2018-02-05 21:41:20 Thank God u r resigning,that is what u meant after all you were bought by the Koch brothers they had control of writing the tax scam. Hey how's u r stocks doing today?
1637 2018-02-05 21:41:20 Hate to break this to you, but you probably own some stocks through your 401(k).
1638 2018-02-05 21:41:18 Y’all i don’t see how if you were a go go dancer now you’re giving advice on stocks? 
1639 2018-02-05 21:41:12 Good thing that cut will make me gain while leaving my kids with bigger debt. Oh, or, I could use that money to replace what I lost in stocks today.
1640 2018-02-05 21:41:08 Why stocks go down when interest rates go up:

"If rising interest rates offer bond and short-term fixed income yields that are more attractive coupled with less risk, then investors may be motivated to seriously consider a trade-off between stocks and bonds."
1641 2018-02-05 21:41:03 ** DJ Newswire:  Trump to sign executive order requiring all $1,000 bonuses received as a result of tax breaks to be invested in stocks
1642 2018-02-05 21:41:03 The dow jones is the average of major stocks in the stock market. It had a huge one time drop and is in the middle of a general decline. This means that the stock market had a freak shock and is on a downward turn comparable to the height of the 2008 stock market crash.
1643 2018-02-05 21:41:01 Me: thanks for the tax break there Donny, I’ll take my tax savings and invest in some stocks

Also me: shit.
1644 2018-02-05 21:40:57 I wonder if you hater libs will actually realize that the market does this and that it's time to buy stocks instead of flapping your gums, i got mine. Thanks Trump.
1645 2018-02-05 21:40:57 Alex I thought Wall Street was Donald’s friend? No??werent we supposed to fulfill our dreams of soaring stocks when Donald was elected? No??
1646 2018-02-05 21:40:54 Gonna use my additional funds from tax cuts to buy stocks tomorrow. Should be a good day to buy
1647 2018-02-05 21:40:53 About the #DowJones - time to buy some cheap stocks!  I'm no fan of current admin, at all - just of buying low and selling high.
1648 2018-02-05 21:40:41 Ohhh, they're having a sale on stocks this week it seems, maybe there was a papa johns like victory promo attached to the Eagles?
1649 2018-02-05 21:40:40 Glad I read the article right! I don’t know a lot about stocks and was worried after I posted the reply 
1650 2018-02-05 21:40:38 I'm sure a lot of us knew this was coming last year. The market does not go up that fast and not make a correction. But I have a feeling with the way Trump pays bills... we're up a creek if we have our money in stocks.
1651 2018-02-05 21:40:32 In other words the economy is fine. Stocks were over valued, the market is going through a correction.
1652 2018-02-05 21:40:29 Seems like for the moment, fear has finally replaced FOMO.  #stocks
1653 2018-02-05 21:40:26 I got choked because I lost $100 on my pot stocks lol. Thanks for the perspective!
1654 2018-02-05 21:40:23 Now that Dow Jones is plummeting, NOW would be a good time to get invested in stocks. 50% of Americans not invested in Wall Street. You owe it to yourself & family. Seek out a financial advisor.
1655 2018-02-05 21:40:23 I get that.  My point is that when wages go up for people, which is generally good for society (I get the inflation downside), but stocks go down, then there's a misalignment of incentives.  For me, it's a(nother) illustration of why "free markets" on their own are problematic
1656 2018-02-05 21:40:18 This is a great way to distract people from the memos by letting them worry about money in the stock market! 1500 points that's an all-time record that's never been that way there should be no reason why stocks go down anyway jobs are plenty people getting bonuses raises
1657 2018-02-05 21:40:17 liar. stocks are down, people are losing money. it indicates no one has any confidence in you.
1658 2018-02-05 21:40:16 The Dow Jones lost $1175 today. The greatest loss in Stocks in a single day in history. Congrats Fake President.
1659 2018-02-05 21:40:16 I mean, seriously, how does a 30-stock “index” in any way measure the 1.5B stocks traded on the NYSE alone? Maybe that worked in 1896 but can we not stop already?
1660 2018-02-05 21:40:11 This is why US stocks are plunging
1661 2018-02-05 21:40:10 And the market's red glare, the stocks bursting in air, gave proof through the day, that .... Old Yellen, come back Yellen! Best dog- gone Fed Chief in the West.
1662 2018-02-05 21:40:01 @OpTic_BigTymeR what stocks should I invest in?
1663 2018-02-05 21:39:59 Pussy Grabber just said not to read too much into the stocks tanking because they don't have a lot to do with the actual economy. When the stocks were good he was saying the EXACT OPPOSITE!
1664 2018-02-05 21:39:54 More money left stocks today than the entire crypto marketcap at it's peak
1665 2018-02-05 21:39:53 We exploded higher in stocks this year into massive overbought area with almost everyone long and super bullish, on nothing, while rate risk, political risk and war risk all rose and now we correct just this last month move and it's a freak out.
smh
1666 2018-02-05 21:39:52 "Computer driven" massive stocks selloff- out of the blue? Could CIA #DeepState bad actors anti Trump elements working with Clinton Wall Street cronies be up to nefarious activities?  Economy is strong, jobs & wages are up, unemployment low, what's up?  @POTUS #investigate
1667 2018-02-05 21:39:50 Oh no! My stocks! My dividends!
1668 2018-02-05 21:39:46 Well liberals...if the stocks were rising because of oblama, then they must be falling because of oblama
1669 2018-02-05 21:39:46 Do you know WHO I am blaming today for my stocks dropping in 1 day $5.08 per share right now? 

YOU!!!! Your adminstration and those greedy criminal REPUBLICANS that wanted to add trillions to our deficient for them to PERSONALLY gain through their own intetests&donations.Not
1670 2018-02-05 21:39:44 S&P 500 VIX up 105%!
Stocks and indices futures in free fall.
1671 2018-02-05 21:39:43 but a different tweet said Samsung was the partner....perhaps its really Verizon? can you hear me now??
1672 2018-02-05 21:39:40 Hey Stable Genius! We’re STILL  WAITING on your Tweets to explain how 1000 drop in stocks is the work of HRC, Obama, FBI, DOJ etc. As I said genius, just sitting here like, really waiting!
1673 2018-02-05 21:39:39 Well this tweet didn't age well considering she said "that market valuations are the source of some concern" Friday and the market dropped 1175 the following Monday.  

#StockMarket #markets #stocks #DJIA #maga #thefive #foxnews
1674 2018-02-05 21:39:31 2018, where DOW/Stocks are dropping like mad, Cryptocurrency hurting while a Twitch streamer (@DrDisRespect) is making in a single day most of our salaries for a year.
1675 2018-02-05 21:39:29 LOL. Stocks fell 1000 pts? Still higher then when Obama was in Office. Stock Sell Offs mean people are putting cash into their bank accounts. 1st time in 8 yrs.
1676 2018-02-05 21:39:29 Dear Fat Ass, 

Want to brag about the largest, single day point drop in Dow Jones' history? 

#stocks #DowJones
@realDonaldTrump
1677 2018-02-05 21:39:19 Stocks falling on interest rate jumps. This is a GOOD thing. Rates have been too low for too long. Market expects more Fed hikes this year.
1678 2018-02-05 21:39:13 Understand market if you are not  millionaires & billionaires  You MUST stay for long term best way 
Maybe low value buy small amount stock long term.  MILLIONAIRE AND billionaires Corporation have large amounts of stocks when stock values up real high they sell good returnPROFIT
1679 2018-02-05 21:39:05 When a stock or stock index hits a record high, that is exactly when you are supposed to sell. And selling drives down the price. 

Ps. The Dow is only 30 stocks and is NOT the economy.
1680 2018-02-05 21:39:00 And stocks are going way DOWN! Time for all these workers to BUY! #ThanksTrump
1681 2018-02-05 21:38:43 Is @realDonaldTrump preparing his tweets to take credit for the stock market literally taking a historic dump under his policies?Bueller ...Bueller...Bueller? #StockMarket #DowJones #stocks
1682 2018-02-05 21:38:42 Remind me to buy stocks in tables if it happens
1683 2018-02-05 21:38:42 Yea they are número uno on the pot stocks watchlist right now for me.
1684 2018-02-05 21:38:36 ALGO trading is ... what caused the market drop today. Between Human panic and machine reaction, I trust the humans most!!
 
Next time, invest in individual stocks not ETF and dont trust the machines
1685 2018-02-05 21:38:35 I need some new stocks to invest in.
1686 2018-02-05 21:38:33 we normalize interest rates and stocks have to compete for capital for the first time in 10 years.   Boo Hoo.
1687 2018-02-05 21:38:33 There are die hard Trump fans out there who really believe he is the reason stocks went up who will now suddenly learn he is not the reason they went down.  And so it goes.
1688 2018-02-05 21:38:24 US stocks crashed and the $VIX skyrocket 115.6% to 37.32
1689 2018-02-05 21:38:20 Morgan Stanley: Tech stocks look 'downright awful' in market getting increasingly worried about 'unhinged' inflation...
1690 2018-02-05 21:38:10 #dowjones bordea el 7% de caída intraday , en su peor caída máxima diaria en la #historia . #trading #stocks #investment
1691 2018-02-05 21:38:06 This is happening because of two previous dems.  Who knows the real value of stocks with trillions thrown at them through QE's.  And we wouldn't have the QE's if not for clinton's repeal of Glass Steagal.
1692 2018-02-05 21:38:03 DO NOT FEAR stocks' drop

Justice MUST be pursued vs Obama & his Traitors in ObamaGate

Sooner BETTER than later: if you let them skid/slide/escape now, Dow would continue to ROT behind fancy veneer, then drop MORE later when discovered

Remember lessons from book of Job in Bible
1693 2018-02-05 21:38:03 How are my stocks doing moron?
1694 2018-02-05 21:38:03 Nobody lost money unless they sold, just like they didn't see a profit unless they sold when the market was high. If you panic sell during a predictable correction you shouldn't be investing in stocks.
1695 2018-02-05 21:38:02 Just checked my Stocks app.  Very red!
1696 2018-02-05 21:38:01 My own analysis,,when there are less than 10 stocks making new highs on NY stock exchange, at a bottom - earlier today number was Four. Expect, stock mkt will rally,,short term choppy. Tuesday, expect Dow Jones close up 200+pts, despite any selling during the day.
Will see...
1697 2018-02-05 21:37:59 Go long pot stocks!
1698 2018-02-05 21:37:56 Looks like it is time to pick up some short puts on beat down stocks. premiums are going up
1699 2018-02-05 21:37:55 I buy pizza not stocks :/
1700 2018-02-05 21:37:54 You don't know much about the market do you?? If you did you would know that the drop in the stocks in this case is indicative of a strong economy. To get to the bottom of the stock downturn, you would have to look at the bond market.
1701 2018-02-05 21:37:53 Anybody who trades in the stocks markets is accustomed to the 
collection of benefits.
1702 2018-02-05 21:37:51 In order to best Obama trump has to get the stock market down to 8000 and back up to 25,000 so prepare for the ride Dow jones #shutdown #stocks #MorningJoe
1703 2018-02-05 21:37:50 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
1704 2018-02-05 21:37:47 Stocks is the WORST thing you can do right now, in my opinion. Check on gold or silver or altcoins for 2018.
1705 2018-02-05 21:37:43 Stocks are down like crazy....
1706 2018-02-05 21:37:41 Time to Buy Stocks.  I'll take advantage of today's correction of nearly 5%.
1707 2018-02-05 21:37:33 Excellent chance to find bargain-priced stocks! #BuyTheDip
1708 2018-02-05 21:37:28 If any (or ALL) of my stocks wish to go into a trading halt today I won't be overly disappointed lol.
1709 2018-02-05 21:37:25 bond yield is up so nervous investors dump stocks to move into bonds.
1710 2018-02-05 21:37:19 stocks are just rich people lottery scratchers
1711 2018-02-05 21:37:19 Yes! Stock market Corrections are the "mothers milk" to investing. The market will self correct in a few days.   Panic selling is what the "big boys" want to drive the prices of stocks down. "Keep calm and soon buy buy buy".....
1712 2018-02-05 21:37:15 That's a lie. Like you have any money to buy and sell stocks. I have a bridge to sell you...
1713 2018-02-05 21:37:14 Unfortunately most people have their retirement $ there. Republicans, btw, 'nicest' Soc Sec idea is tying $ to stocks also. 
1714 2018-02-05 21:37:08 Most of his base isn’t financially well off enough to invest in stocks. His base will turn on @FoxNews and hear everyone blame Obama and hillary
1715 2018-02-05 21:37:01 Fuck stocks. Fuck the stock market.
1716 2018-02-05 21:36:56 @Richzeoli So Eagles win and stocks tank bigly. Harrumph.
1717 2018-02-05 21:36:54 @cnnbrk Ohhhh give me a break   CNN salivating on something that changed    Turn it around to BADdontvtry to explain the market that people quadrupled their money in stocks    Pretty sure cashed em in while high! But.... you’ll make it doomsday!  Americans are smart!
1718 2018-02-05 21:36:53 Why did the stocks go down on the release of the fisa memo? What's coming next what's happening now?

There's your answer. Interest rates are superficial answers.

Like when Trump got elected stocks tanked 800 points.
1719 2018-02-05 21:36:52 me and people with stocks
1720 2018-02-05 21:36:52 The three best things about a major correction. 1) Weeds out fake traders / investors.  2) New buying opportunities on stocks previously extended.  3) less cryptocurrency ads. $es $spx
1721 2018-02-05 21:36:51 Seriously though, all my stocks and cryptos in my portfolio got fucking slammed today. It’s gonna be time to pull out my investments soon.
1722 2018-02-05 21:36:50 Yep. "Stocks are on sale." Biggest ever one day drop.
1723 2018-02-05 21:36:47 The panic on wallstreet is REAL...great time to come up after this overdue correction!!!  #Investor #Wallstreet #Stocks #StockMarket #GetMoney #HODL
$MU $SPH $PYPL $O $SLB $WATT $XXII
1724 2018-02-05 21:36:33 I sure hope so for a lot of people! I only invested spare change but some people invested EVERYTHING. I did learn a ton, it's quite a bit different than day-trading stocks, that's for sure.
1725 2018-02-05 21:36:31 If your under the age of 40 you be 60% in stocks, 25% in ETF and Mutual Funds, and in 15% in bonds
1726 2018-02-05 21:36:29 hahah no if its made in america i wont buy not till your out of office why would i help out a lying ,, cheating big bully racist president noway . i even taking my stocks out of america till its safe again
1727 2018-02-05 21:36:28 You seem pretty smart about stocks. Question? Is it normal to lose $2000 from Friday-Monday? Can I pull my money without penalty?
1728 2018-02-05 21:36:26 I definitely recommend panic selling stocks and crap coins. 

Eventually they will go to near zero. Maybe it’s not today, but it’s a bad bet.

But don’t panic sell useful and desirable items 

Esp. when most of the world doesn’t understand that they are useful or desire them.
1729 2018-02-05 21:36:24 You and your swamp cashing out stocks at an all-time high, and now we have the LARGEST ONE-DAY STOCK MARKET DROP IN HISTORY!!!  Release your tax returns, you lying fraud!  #Resign
1730 2018-02-05 21:36:21 yeah, I own STOCKS...

Suicidal

and they're way down! thanks to antidepressants
1731 2018-02-05 21:36:19 Thanks to the historic TAX SCAM that I signed into law, your paychecks are going to be MEANINGLESS, your stocks are going way DOWN, and America is once again A WASTELAND OF ECONOMIC DESPAIR!
1732 2018-02-05 21:36:12 Also, just to state the obvious. Entire indexes of large cap stocks are not supposed to move in a parabolic fashion as if they were microcaps. Just saying.
1733 2018-02-05 21:36:11 Finally the #Trump impact is showing:
Wall Street Plunges With Dow Falling Below 25,000 Dow slide is worst single day drop since financial crisis in 2008.

1734 2018-02-05 21:36:05 I'm just waiting for Trump to say the Dow Jones dropped 1,175 points because millions of illegal immigrants all sold their stocks.
1735 2018-02-05 21:35:56 What you're watching in the stock market today is large institutional trading, selling off.  Why?

It's due to Janet Yellen's interest rate increase.  That made stocks less attractive and bonds more attractive.

This will stop.  It's an adjustment.
1736 2018-02-05 21:35:52 People laughed when bitcoin bubbled and tanked, then their stocks followed right after. Nobody's laughing now.
1737 2018-02-05 21:35:50 Hope another day in declines and I'll add more exposure to my favorite stocks. Booyah! Jim @jimcramer #madtweets @MadMoneyOnCNBC
1738 2018-02-05 21:35:49 to add i wouldnt vouch for a buying opportunity today. best to observe or sell your extended or weaker looking stocks. should be in risk management mode by now
1739 2018-02-05 21:35:48 How do you know this? Any proof?
1740 2018-02-05 21:35:46 Check out all the America-haters here, gleeful of a stocks downturn.  Most people knew to expect a balancing out soon, and if you're smart it's also an opportunity...and so the cycles continue.
1741 2018-02-05 21:35:44 When to get in to buy cheap stocks
1742 2018-02-05 21:35:44 The tone of the leader of the US has a lot to do with financial activity. When a president inspires business investment, good things happen. Unless you think stocks will drop to the level below Nov 2016 (and that happens), Pres. Trump is entitled.
1743 2018-02-05 21:35:41 So, @realDonaldTrump, you take all the credit for rising stocks, do you take the blame for the last three days of drops that wiped out most of 2018's gains? Or will you ignore it as expected? (You have little short term effect either way, but your sheep are too stupid to know it)
1744 2018-02-05 21:35:39 It’s telling that of all stocks I track, only Snapchat and Blue Apron are looking fine this afternoon. $SNAP $APRN
1745 2018-02-05 21:35:35 Glad I sold all of my stocks.
Too bad I put it into crypto. 
At least we are the champions.
1746 2018-02-05 21:35:28 Since financial analysts seem to just pluck stuff out of their ass and ascribe emotions to market movements, I thought I'd give it a shot.

"Panic today swept the markets as speculators rushed to pull their money out of the stocks they'd foolheartedly bet on"

How'd I do?
1747 2018-02-05 21:35:23 Maybe your sponsor pulled some of those massive profits. It is stocks you know.
1748 2018-02-05 21:35:20 When Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan was President, he stopped a falling stock market by making a speech where he was essentially like “hey none of this really matters, let’s just pretend things are fine and stop selling all our stocks.”

1750 2018-02-05 21:35:18 Doesn’t he have enough money now? Gilead! Moving to India would be a cheaper way to get cured. He needs to speak with his broker about investing in socially responsible stocks...that’s an option for them all!  Liars all.
1751 2018-02-05 21:35:10 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest  point decline in history during a trading day.
1752 2018-02-05 21:35:09 Credit cards? No one should be buying crypto, stocks, or any investment with a credit card period - that's crazy. Borrowing money and paying interest to try to make money is insane. I can't see how that's a bad thing.
1753 2018-02-05 21:35:09 So, was this recent stock market tumble a belated response to Trump and his policies or where a lot of stocks tied to Bitcoin?
1754 2018-02-05 21:35:08 Did anyone else notice a change in his delivery today? More than usual..depressed, desperate? Unable to accept that he is not "loved" embarrassed by the memo, stocks , under investigation closing in. I am truly frightened .#25thAmendmentNow
1755 2018-02-05 21:35:08 Why stocks go down when interest rates go up:

"If rising interest rates offer bond and short-term fixed income yields that are more attractive coupled with less risk, then investors may be motivated to seriously consider a trade-off between stocks and bonds."
1756 2018-02-05 21:34:58 Stocks are tanking! What’s going on?  Dems?
1757 2018-02-05 21:34:55 It's only down to what it was at the start of this year.  If something like that alarms you, then you know nothing about stocks...  Mark my words, the market will be over 26k by March.
1758 2018-02-05 21:34:49 % stocks trading above 40DMAs plunged to 19.4% Market is now oversold with historic % gain on #VIX lighting the way. $SPY $QQQ #T2108 #AT40
1759 2018-02-05 21:34:42 So, the first year of any presidency, a lot of what happens to job numbers & stocks market is a result of how the previous admin ran things. This is not a partisan take- would say the same if this had been Hillary. Now that it's been a year, these are Trump's numbers. "Dow Jones"
1760 2018-02-05 21:34:41 At least stocks denominated in Bitcoin didn't go down.
1761 2018-02-05 21:34:38 Can more money be made in crypto or stocks
1762 2018-02-05 21:34:37 Should the Commander in Chief take ownership when Dow Jones plunged also? Or does he take credit only when the stocks reach a record high??? I don't know.... Just curious for some answers...
1763 2018-02-05 21:34:33 Tonight on Hannity: "President Trump has done it again, creating a buying opportunity in stocks for real Americans!"
1764 2018-02-05 21:34:33 Great to see all these old, dusty, baby boomer, stock market guys get fed a shit sandwich too. Your stocks are also Monopoly money and bunch of millennials just locked in profits while you sat on your hands. #DowJones #btc #nasdaq #StockMarket #sandp #eth

1766 2018-02-05 21:34:29 I have over $250,000 in stocks in the market and I’m not worried I didn’t even call my broker. First quarter growth is expected to be over 4%. What happened today was a whole lot of people became millionaires and billionaires it’s people profit taking that’s all.

1770 2018-02-05 21:34:15 So @POTUS how do today’s stocks affect Joe Plummer?
1771 2018-02-05 21:34:12 Well yeah, any one with even the most basic knowledge of stocks and market know that they always drop after a long way up. 

Bitcoin is a good example, up up up and down hard but now it's going back up

Welcome to economics 101
1772 2018-02-05 21:34:10 Stocks are on sale y’all!! #DowJones
1773 2018-02-05 21:34:10 i would have thought bitcoin would have soared in times of crash for the stocks....
1774 2018-02-05 21:34:07 Trump going to take responsibility for stocks crash as he takes credit for Obama boom ? Or will he blame Hillary ?Or FBI?Or Shiff?
1775 2018-02-05 21:34:04 "Stocks Go Up, Stocks Go Down." Something else is a foot though. What is going on? #DowJones #StockMarketCrash
1776 2018-02-05 21:34:02 DO NOT FEAR stocks' drop

"Obey God, leave consequences to Him, He will take care of everything"

God commands us to follow Him, we can deal with Enemies but ultimately He will foil them

Foes sell-off to scare you: show Courage, they'll see it doesn't sway you, they'll stop ploy
1777 2018-02-05 21:33:59 They can put it in the stock market.  It’s talking hard.  They should be able to buy some nice juicy stocks
1778 2018-02-05 21:33:59 wrong, they aren’t worth what they were this time last year, it erased the gains of 2018 which is just over a month old, Get it? The Dow is 30 stocks, not the entire market, please stop tweeting, you are clueless.
1779 2018-02-05 21:33:58 It's only down to what it was at the start of this year.  If something like that alarms you, then you know nothing about stocks...  Mark my words, the market will be over 26k by March.
1780 2018-02-05 21:33:56 If it helps you to feel more at ease, my husband is in finance and says on avg. there's no 10 year period where stocks don't make a recovery. However, I feel this last 10-year span may be an exception given our current stock market pitfalls
1781 2018-02-05 21:33:52 So is this Trump's stock Market or Obama's?

It would be nice to get you on the record so we can remind you when stocks shoot back up.
1782 2018-02-05 21:33:50 Invest in stocks. Buy low, as they say
1783 2018-02-05 21:33:49 When Stock rose  tRump made it about HIM. Anyone with a working brain knows the economy has little to do w/ Rise & Fail of stocks. Seeing the wealth is concentrated at the top. Only those w the money influence big daily changes. Actions of Major players scared PPL on the bottom
1784 2018-02-05 21:33:46 He wouldn’t be Tweeting about the markets so much — and crowing about his own impact on stocks — if he actually read his copies of Forbes Magazine instead of just looking up his name and then handing them over to Stormy Daniels.
1785 2018-02-05 21:33:41 Don't worry!  I'm sure @realDonaldTrump and Munchkin and all the rest of the robber barons sold off their stocks before the crash.  Being an insider pays off.

1788 2018-02-05 21:33:36 People who are getting that extra $1.50 in their paychecks aren't able to buy stocks, so #tRumpMagic, er Bullshit, still works on them... until they start losing their jobs. Then they'll find out there's no safety net.
1789 2018-02-05 21:33:34 The economy is so great that equities just crashed 1,100 points. Either the president doesn't know what he's talking about or this market doesn't reflect the true economy. My guess is that it's both...

1791 2018-02-05 21:33:22 Its a sign that interest rates are going to change very soon (possibly fed action) market doesn't like cheap money.  How many of these tv idiots understand how stocks work?
1792 2018-02-05 21:33:21 Yeah, best president ever if you like seeing your money invested in stocks evaporate.
1793 2018-02-05 21:33:20 I think that's being a little more than optimistic. I don't think people are going to sell their stocks for crypto maybe a small percentage. You are talking about companies in the S&P 500 with sound fundamentals I love crypto and I'm hoping for the best...
1794 2018-02-05 21:33:19 Stocks!
1795 2018-02-05 21:33:13 nah all good these things happen hold ya stocks it will bounce back as all ways
1796 2018-02-05 21:33:09 Ima need @realDonaldTrump to stop commenting on the fucking market MY STOCKS ARE AT AN ALL TIME LOW 
1797 2018-02-05 21:33:04 When the stocks go up, he will
1798 2018-02-05 21:32:55 @realDonaldTrump, you privileged pile of dog dung. You may still have your loyal followers but your li'minions will care more about their $$ & stocks soon enough. you are a false prophet spreading false hope. The very people who helped you get here will be the ones to finish you.
1799 2018-02-05 21:32:55 Yes, only the filthy rich can afford stocks. For example, a share of Twitter, Inc. is currently $25- our of reach for most Americans.
1800 2018-02-05 21:32:54 Asian stocks are gonna fall all the way to australia tonight
1801 2018-02-05 21:32:52 That was intense. Bonds finished up so I take that as a good sign.  Nothing changed with fundamentals.  Don’t panic! #stocks
1802 2018-02-05 21:32:44 @Project_Cars_ The dow is down a 1000 points now. Better sell your #stocks and buy #bitcon while you can.
1803 2018-02-05 21:32:39 Janet Yellin's last day was Friday. She stated previously stocks were trading artificially high and then raised interest rates before she left. Dow Jones crashes. Coincidence? No fucking way.
1804 2018-02-05 21:32:36 “The markets are just taking a bit of a breather, which I’d argue is somewhat healthy,” Joseph Tanious, for Bessemer Trust. “Data suggest that world economic growth is solid & corporate profits in the U.S. are strong, two factors that should help U.S. stocks keep climbing.”
1805 2018-02-05 21:32:33 I think I know what's happening: Republicans crash the economy, rich people can buy stocks super-cheap, & then Democrats are left to build it back up again! ;) /sarc, don't @me!
1806 2018-02-05 21:32:31 Stocks fall big, don’t panic it will rebound...However if your local Tv stations start running stories about saving money by no buying your morning coffee..packing your lunch..Then you can panic
1807 2018-02-05 21:32:29 Let’s jump over and see what Fredo Trump is douching about today in light of the sell off... #stocks
1808 2018-02-05 21:32:24 DOW is down 38% for me in my stocks, went from being WAY up to barely
1809 2018-02-05 21:32:21 And, stocks are way down! Don't forget to boast about That! Largest drop in history!
1810 2018-02-05 21:32:14 So glad i sold all my index fund stocks last Thursday after the market started dropping. Keeping all my regular stocks as i’m in it for the long term with those.
1811 2018-02-05 21:32:13 Also, this drop equals only 4% overall.  Because the stocks rose so high.  Also, it will go back up.  This is a heavy donar sell out from Dem party.  Soros did this in another country and is not allowed back there now.
1812 2018-02-05 21:32:09 Can you imagine if stocks were 24/7 like Bitcoin?  I can’t.
1813 2018-02-05 21:32:07 hello world i’ve decided today is the day to buy some stocks
1814 2018-02-05 21:31:57 Stocks look great today! Thanks @realDonaldTrump
1815 2018-02-05 21:31:54 No, you both will go down in history as a punchline. Hey, haven’t heard you mention the stock market lately. Just wondering who you’re going to blame it on when they tank. Hillary, Obama?  You took full credit when stocks were high. What say you?
1816 2018-02-05 21:31:54 Stocks are crashing.....
1817 2018-02-05 21:31:54 1. Friday, it was the rise in yields what analysts argued were behind the falls in stocks; but today’s fall in DJI has taken place  with small declines in yields. So yields were not the cause.
1818 2018-02-05 21:31:51 stocks may have dropped but lbr they were gonna do that anyway. i got new sloan and new bodega boys today and that's literally all i need
1819 2018-02-05 21:31:47 It's a good day to buy stocks. 
1820 2018-02-05 21:31:46 #Gold and #silver up marginally, acting as hedge &!safe haven and doing well considering scale of sell off in #stocks
1821 2018-02-05 21:31:44 @JacobAWohl is right, leave it to those lying leftists to scare people from bitcoin and stocks. I double mortgaged my house for bitcoin and stocks because in Trumps America, the only losers are impure degenerates.
1822 2018-02-05 21:31:44 What would you define as extensive cherry picking? I just went on yahoo finance and found 4 stocks immediately that appreciated everywhere from 60%-120% over the past 52 weeks without extensive searching.
1823 2018-02-05 21:31:44 One possibility: some folks had programmed trade for stocks reaching target levels.  How much of sell-off was due to robots?
1824 2018-02-05 21:31:40 I don't buy European stocks --- maybe ADR's here domestically.

1829 2018-02-05 21:31:18 How could this be shocking?  Stocks shot up at a ridiculous rate over the past six weeks; a short term correction was inevitable.  The really shock will come when the market doesn't immediately rally, but flatlines...

CNN : Stocks went into free-fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points
1831 2018-02-05 21:31:14 Have you seen the stocks today? If you want to take credit for the stock market rise, you must take blame for its fall.
1832 2018-02-05 21:31:07 The Stock market always tells you something. The last few days the market has been more volatile than we have seen since 08 crash. 45 who always brags about stocks is quiet 
1833 2018-02-05 21:31:05 Bill - high frequency trading - those algorithms cannot handle the sell/buy orders. It’s a flash crash, won’t last for long at all. Came off a groggy Friday close, but there’s no reason. Rates will normalize and bond prices will decrease, thus having more cash flood stocks
1834 2018-02-05 21:31:02 I blame Trump. The Tax Scam is overheating the economy causing interest rates to increase causing stocks to fall
1835 2018-02-05 21:31:01 Just before the bell rang i invested 20 million in monopoly money into the Tech world. They refused my money. I said ok, then can i have the stocks for free?

1839 2018-02-05 21:30:53 The moment you wish you could edit... argg... Didn't we (independents, democrats, and some logical republicans) say that a person who has bankrupted 6 business wouldn't work? When can we say #wetoldyouso #StockMarketCrash #StockMarket #stocks @realDonaldTrump
1840 2018-02-05 21:30:50 This sounds stupid, but we should remember that prices of shares are the prices that transactions are happening at a point in time, which are transactions between a particular non-random set of shareholders. #stocks #markets #quasiefficientmarkets
1841 2018-02-05 21:30:48 Thank Obama for that ... or is that Trump’s fault? make up your mind please because when the stocks rebound again you can’t keep jumping bandwagons, you’re gonna break your ankles 
1842 2018-02-05 21:30:43 LOL, Chump isn't taking credit now!  He's an idiot and all his followers were trying boost about the Dow Stocks etc!  Hilarious!
1843 2018-02-05 21:30:40 So since DT has taken all the credit for stocks going up, who’s he going to blame for the big drop ???
1844 2018-02-05 21:30:37 Feeling good about liquidating most of my stocks last week.
1845 2018-02-05 21:30:33 hubs is all bummed.. stocks went bust

Similar, but inverse, temptations to what I was feeling while passing 18k on the way up...
1850 2018-02-05 21:30:14 You get them Debbie!! They going to say more jobs added than expected, unemployment at record low levels, stocks are still up bigly since Trump was elected blah blah but you see through the Bs Debbie!  
1851 2018-02-05 21:30:12 being a business major means everyone in class is looking at stocks instead of paying attention to the lecture
1852 2018-02-05 21:30:12 When he was dumb enough to take credit for the Trump bump there were market analysts who warned of a correction of key over-valued stocks or institutional investors cashing out. Welcome to the Trump slump!
1853 2018-02-05 21:30:10 In 2008 I was following Let's Players  and YouTubers. 10 years later I see furries talking about stocks and feel the same excitement, wtf
1854 2018-02-05 21:30:06 Mr. @alangreenspn was correct - the bubble of stocks and bonds.

1859 2018-02-05 21:29:47 Those investors rushing out of stocks into bonds are moving from the frying pan into the fire .The bond market implosion will be the next big crisis. "Dow Jones "
1860 2018-02-05 21:29:43 .@EddyElfenbein is tweeting more than usual, did something happen today. #stocks #investing
1861 2018-02-05 21:29:42 The Dow is not the Economy folks.
The credit markets and complicated parts that are the real drivers didn't plunge like the stocks did.
1862 2018-02-05 21:29:34 Wow. 1100 point drop today.

Guess since you've equated 30 stocks with "the economy" you'll be quick to accept blame, right @potus @realdonaldtrump?

Also - you've used "little" 7 or 8 times already. It's tired.
1863 2018-02-05 21:29:32 Medical stocks plunging without Obama care
1864 2018-02-05 21:29:32 Lord my stocks taking a tumble.
1865 2018-02-05 21:29:31 If you are diversified in your investment declines and pull backs don’t hurt as much. You should have what’s called “defensive” stocks
1866 2018-02-05 21:29:28 The cool thing about Dow crashing is most people don’t have any stocks so it doesn’t affect them at all
1867 2018-02-05 21:29:25 from a newsletter I get - "his correction is nothing to worry about and it is actually a good buying opportunity. It certainly looks like the market is looking for a bottom and while we may get another retest or two, our stocks are great buys at current levels."
1868 2018-02-05 21:29:24 vale, mañana quizá subo el gif, no hay stocks, todo se hizo desde 0!
1869 2018-02-05 21:29:18 If you been eyeing some stocks now is definitely a good time to buy in.
1870 2018-02-05 21:29:16 Oh well. This only hurts the upper-class elitists who own stocks and bonds. The other half of the US population is already poor, so they haven't lost anything more than what they already have lost.
1871 2018-02-05 21:29:16 $SPX 5 stocks were green today
1872 2018-02-05 21:29:15 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
you built that
1873 2018-02-05 21:29:14 Anyone who understands the stock markets well would known that the rise in stocks is a bubble.Where do we go from here. Market in panic?
1874 2018-02-05 21:29:12 Things are not well in stocks
1875 2018-02-05 21:29:12 Stocks went into free-fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day. Let’s see if you find a way to blame obama for this Donald.
1876 2018-02-05 21:29:08 Both of those statements are true.
The stock market doesn't serve as a good indicator for the economy as a whole, but because Trump has tied himself so closely to the booming stocks, a drop will bring him down as well
1877 2018-02-05 21:29:07 The stocks also went DOWN.
1878 2018-02-05 21:28:59 How do you buy European stocks, Brian? Fidelity charges a $50 fee for buying European stocks. I'm not sure if the fee is on all European stocks but the one I wanted all had it.
1879 2018-02-05 21:28:58 What's up with the stock market why is it that trumps not taking credit for the fall, he did when stocks was rising.
1880 2018-02-05 21:28:57 Have 3 stocks. One food company,other middle-priced tires,then dollar store. Ppl gotta eat. If their pockets r light they buy cheaper tires & shop at dollar store. So maybe I can survive. No idea what's in fed retirement. I know 1/2 in treasuries,rest is managed.
1881 2018-02-05 21:28:54 Dave ask the Pres not to use the stocks as his win cause when it goes down he will have to own it. Back off from it as he will look bad
1882 2018-02-05 21:28:54 TIL: There are a lot people that shouldn't be allowed to invest in stocks.
1883 2018-02-05 21:28:51 Best before dates...and stocks still to work through 
1884 2018-02-05 21:28:45 Did we (independents, democrats, and some logical republicans) say that a person who has bankrupted 6 business? When can we say #wetoldyouso #StockMarketCrash #StockMarket #stocks @realDonaldTrump
1885 2018-02-05 21:28:40 Exactly !!!   The #crazyLeft never reports when stocks are up
1886 2018-02-05 21:28:39 @Socal_crypto you know someone out there bought at 20k, sold at 10k, then invested in stocks.... rip to whoever that person is
1887 2018-02-05 21:28:37 Say you bought $25 socks a month ago. What do you have now? $25 socks. $25 in btc a month ago would leave you with barely over $12 now. Crypto isn't currency. It's a commodity. You generally can't buy stocks with credit cards either. It's too volatile to be useful.
1888 2018-02-05 21:28:30 Crypto riches closed their positions and went short on stocks ;)
1889 2018-02-05 21:28:27 Stocks tanking makes Trump look like an idiot is pure karma: Saying he controls the high markets...well, they tanked today; the @Eagles won the #SuperBowl and the walls of justice have him cornered
1890 2018-02-05 21:28:26 As people bail on stocks, wonder who is scarfing up.  People who can ride the wave will win bigly.
#CCOT
1891 2018-02-05 21:28:15 I don't think the memo had anything to do with the recent "downturn" In fact, the people who make a living in the financial markets forecast this drop, wanted it to happen EARLY in 2018 and are now happy as hell because stocks are cheap again.
Wall Street is ecstatic tonight.
1892 2018-02-05 21:28:14 "wait wait wait, YOU MEAN STOCKS CAN FALL?!?! I'M SUING!!!"
1893 2018-02-05 21:28:14 Uhh no honey, according to TRUMP himself, he’s the reason why the stocks are up. So according to TRUMP we should await his “yes this is also my fault” but you and i both know he’s not going to mention anything thats his own fault right?
1894 2018-02-05 21:28:10 I'm trying to decide what to buy.  

I'm leaning toward energy stocks.  Maybe Amazon.
1895 2018-02-05 21:28:07 An intelligent trader will now take his money out of stocks and put it in #BITCOIN.
1896 2018-02-05 21:28:01 Watch the video.... DOW is "underwater". Do you even know stocks
1897 2018-02-05 21:28:00 Everyone on @business and @CNBC crying about the markets getting his for 4.60%. Get over it...things don't go up forever, what we had the past couple of years was not real market action. This selloff is Fed induced, plain and simple...

#stocks #wallstreet #SellOff
1898 2018-02-05 21:27:58 The economic news was good today. Investors are running scared of inflation so they sold off stocks to purchase bonds. Adjustments can be painful but can also be healthy for the markets as well.
1899 2018-02-05 21:27:58 How’d everyone’s stocks do today?
1900 2018-02-05 21:27:55 Crypto dropped further than stocks
1901 2018-02-05 21:27:55 Some perspective on the recent huge stock market losses: 1) stocks have still been on a tremendous run over the past 12 months; 2) GDP growth, job growth, and unemployment are far better indicators of economic health, and by those measures, the US economy is looking good.
1902 2018-02-05 21:27:53 If under trump, money launderers have been able to buy up stocks with bitcoin, this would explain the runup and the crash.

Bitcoin is an unproven, unstable currency.  How much bitcoin has been going into the markets and brokerage accounts over the past year?
1903 2018-02-05 21:27:48 Fed Model - 10-year treasuries represent the "risk-free rate".  This must be measured against the risk premium on equities (since there is no guarantee on stocks).  Spiking interest rates in the bond market makes asset prices decline.
1904 2018-02-05 21:27:42 Wow! For the first time ever, the 40 or so Tech stocks that I track ALL showed declines...every one! Some are predicting declines tomorrow.
1905 2018-02-05 21:27:42 @realDonaldTrump stocks are falling and falling quick! Who you going to blame this time? It’s  all on you!
1906 2018-02-05 21:27:41 I'm not pretending to know anything about stocks. Just the way it was framed made it sound bad...
1907 2018-02-05 21:27:41 Now all the wallstreet guys feel what cryptopeople must feel. It hurts no? Now get back to work and lets try to increase markets again instead killing the other one #WallStreet #StockMarket #cryptocrash #nasdaq #stocks #stocks
1908 2018-02-05 21:27:39 Quality stocks like $AAPL will always bounce back up when selling is done. Time to nibble as it goes on a sale.
1909 2018-02-05 21:27:37 the jokes on you, my 3 stocks were already doing bad
1910 2018-02-05 21:27:37 My 17Yo HF Manager is selling stocks to buy crypto @rvc330
1911 2018-02-05 21:27:27 What stocks should I invest my $27.50 tax cut in? Asking for a friend.
1912 2018-02-05 21:27:27 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
1913 2018-02-05 21:27:23 But whatever happened to our yields up stocks up argument?!!! 
1914 2018-02-05 21:27:19 It's iterative. The next piece of big economic data will impact Treasuries and that will flow through to stocks if it increases expectations for hikes.
1915 2018-02-05 21:27:16 Unless you are in it for the long run, you want to buy stocks at a low price and sell high. For whatever reason, Dow Jones had a selling day today.
1916 2018-02-05 21:27:13 Tomorrow India will wake up to a Wall Street melt down! Dow plunges over 1100 points... #Dow #stocks
1917 2018-02-05 21:27:06 Sheesh that’s why I can never see my self investing in stocks in the future! The Dow Jones just went crazy
1918 2018-02-05 21:27:03 Mine went down $16 & thanks for this: Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics.
1919 2018-02-05 21:27:02 Serious profit taking underway, but the drop will also draw others back in to pick up bargains in discounted stocks.  Longer term, the market will stabilize.  It may not go back to previous high, but it will remain strong.
1920 2018-02-05 21:26:59 Hey look at it this way...Stocks are back on sale folk$!
1921 2018-02-05 21:26:58 He brags and takes credit for stocks being up, should take the blame now too.
1922 2018-02-05 21:26:56 And the value of my stocks is heading way south:(
1923 2018-02-05 21:26:49 Hey @realDonaldTrump when are you gonna take responsibility for the stocks falling significantly for the last three days? Or is this somehow Obama’s fault too?
1924 2018-02-05 21:26:48 Someday I would like to read an analysis of the mechanisms, theoretical and practical, by which money going short vol, or long vol, feeds through to the price of stocks.
1925 2018-02-05 21:26:48 Main stream media is talking about the #markets oh boy. #stocks #investing
1926 2018-02-05 21:26:46 So tomorrow is big. Either we give the green light on #cryptocurrencies in America and legitimize- stocks tumble and #btc #eth explode or we shut it down they try “popping the bubble” and stocks tumble in fallout.
1927 2018-02-05 21:26:46 I've been warning about inflation since July '17. Repeatedly stated that inflation would force CBs hands in '18. Stocks love inflation at first, but eventually it turns into hate.
1928 2018-02-05 21:26:46 Like good ol @CharlieOverturf once told me when I asked what he would do if his stocks tanked, start buying more.
1929 2018-02-05 21:26:45 Not tweeting about the stock market? Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest  point decline in history during a trading day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. RESIGN!
1930 2018-02-05 21:26:42 I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the same day the market tumbles, so does $BTC and crypto. Lots of investors are pulling money out of their portfolios and many own stocks and crypto.
1931 2018-02-05 21:26:40 Cute, but stocks are still outperforming bonds this year, and will do so for the rest of the year
1932 2018-02-05 21:26:35 US stocks way down.. what's going on ?
1933 2018-02-05 21:26:34 #StockMarketCrash the average person doesn’t own stocks and shares ...it’s the playground of the rich . We ain’t gonna put up with any austerity due to trading gamblers and elite playboys f***n up the markets anymore . Wake up ! Slaves no more !
1934 2018-02-05 21:26:33 I mentioned last week hedge fund selling stocks due to covering losses on crypto ccy's.  The correlation of Bitcoin/ Dow/ Oil /Stocks is very real #RobPetertoPayPaul
1935 2018-02-05 21:26:29 The ATL Fed just estimated 1st quarter GDP to be 5.4%. That means the Fed will have to act to keep INFLATION in check. That means likely BIG interest rate increases in 2018, which, by the way, stocks HATE.

That pretty much explains it.
1936 2018-02-05 21:26:24 So, it couldn't possibly be employment & wages are rising so rapidly that it is sparking inflation fears that is lowing bond prices pushing up their yields so investors are taking their money out of the stock market and investing in bonds, right?? Why do you only look at stocks?
1937 2018-02-05 21:26:21 @realDonaldTrump my stocks are suffering thanks a lot bitch
1938 2018-02-05 21:26:16 And my mandatory withdrawal will be based on market close 12/31/17. Screwed again. If there's not enof cash in my 401K have to sell stocks. Screwed more,broker's fee. Also annual fee. Screwed again.
1939 2018-02-05 21:26:15 Been thinking the same thing....he claimed the rise in stocks over the past 12 months, will he claim the 4% drop too? #methinksnot

1943 2018-02-05 21:26:05 Stocks 26500 last Tuesday.  Now 24500.  Hmmmm.  Who is @realDonaldTrump going to blame today.  @BarackObama is happy to let Trump beat him on this record.  1150pts lost in one day.   Great jobs REPUBLICANS! CAN'T BLAME DEMS FOR THIS ONE.  @CNN @SpeakerRyan @FoxNews @foxandfriends
1944 2018-02-05 21:26:04 I can't imagine all the peeps who have been loading the boat in dec/Jan  #stocks
1945 2018-02-05 21:26:00 i know nothing about stocks but would love some advice on what socks i should buys so someone please socksplain me do i go regular kind or the no-shows
1946 2018-02-05 21:25:57 @realDonaldTrump Hey Moron guess you are also responsible for the stock market crashing. Dummy you caused this with your stupid tax cuts. Deficit booming, causes interest rates to go up, stocks down. Here comes the Trump Recession.
1947 2018-02-05 21:25:55 knock, knock: hi, the mash was fantastic and I've got some milk and butter left for breakfast tomorrow. Now about those stocks... mmm...
1948 2018-02-05 21:25:54 He could have invested his money into stocks, made millions, brought a small Nuke off the Russian black market and took out New York. This excuse it's best to make mass killing easy incase they come up with a better idea is just a pathetic.
1949 2018-02-05 21:25:53 Biggest drop in Dow Jones IA since financial crisis... at one point biggest ever intraday points drop. Ends day down 1175 points... contact who predicted 2008 “crash territory.. stocks & bounds supremely overvalued/ market exhaustion”
1950 2018-02-05 21:25:52 Jonathan, I assure you, whoever said that doesn't own stocks!
1951 2018-02-05 21:25:52 #Stocks are tanking and #Bitcoin is dying. Feel bad for those who bought at peak. Sell, sell, sell.
1952 2018-02-05 21:25:50 And today was the biggest loss in the history of the stock market.  We gonna boast about the stocks today Cheeto?

1955 2018-02-05 21:25:35 Stocks crashing. Is that your fault? @realDonaldTrump. You took credit for it going up.
1956 2018-02-05 21:25:34 My guess is a new proposed Fed chairman effected stocks... No one clearly knows what policies will be after Janet Yellen. Hope soon will clear the bad air over stocks
1957 2018-02-05 21:25:33 Here's the correction you claimed you wanted. Bought stocks for little Jonny's college fund and in my Roth IRA Friday & more tomorrow AM.
1958 2018-02-05 21:25:30 Please do not panic sell today because the market dropped.  As long as your overall investment mix is sensible, there’s no need to do anything different today from what you would have done if stocks had gone up.
1959 2018-02-05 21:25:27 Lol.. I bet you not following what is happening. Stocks dropped 4.6% in a single day. Since last week over 3 trillions lost.
1960 2018-02-05 21:25:26 Go behind the number, how far, to Fiat is worthless, debt levels are so insane that Fiat's worthlessness is the irony allowing credibility, Central Banks have been acting as quasi hedge funds and have been the only ones buying bonds and stocks (other than cheap lending buy backs)
1961 2018-02-05 21:25:25 Stocks plummet under your watch 
1962 2018-02-05 21:25:19 Stockcharts Top 10 % up list for SP500 shows 5 stocks. Five were green today.  Unreal!
1963 2018-02-05 21:25:12 I'm so glad I sold all my stocks last week. 
1964 2018-02-05 21:25:12 @realDonaldTrump Biggest DROP in stocks in History!! Something else you can brag about!!
1965 2018-02-05 21:25:09 Stocks down in worst fall since 2008!!!! Still claiming credit Donnie?
1966 2018-02-05 21:25:09 Stocks go down, Gold goes up! Works in our favor. #AllITouchIsGold
1967 2018-02-05 21:25:03 Yes, but, the lesson on stocks would need to end with: stocks used to be used for a purpose and nominally still are but really the stock market is just a big gambling parlor and is mostly useless and pointless.
1968 2018-02-05 21:25:01 NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling nearly 1,600 points at its lows - the biggest intraday point drop in history - as a long-awaited pullback from record highs deepened.
1969 2018-02-05 21:24:58 Once again the market corrects and tomorrow or the next day the super rich guys will be able to buy blue chip stocks for cheap and make millions or billions in a matter of 24 - 48 hours, the rich get richer the poor gets poorer life goes on!
1970 2018-02-05 21:24:57 Why do I drunk buy stocks and not pizza like a normal person
1971 2018-02-05 21:24:54 So glad I recently sold all my stocks and put all my money into a silent tortilla chip start-up.
1972 2018-02-05 21:24:54 It was a flash crash due to high frequency institutional traders all having the same stops programmed because a pullback was expected.

Then people started selling downside insurance and therefore to hedge they had to start shorting stocks. 

This was automation. (IMO)
1973 2018-02-05 21:24:53 Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics.
1974 2018-02-05 21:24:51 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest  point decline in history during a trading day. #Dow #StockMarket #TrumpStockCrash #TrumpStockCrash #TrumpStockCrash #TrumpStockCrash #TrumpStockCrash
1975 2018-02-05 21:24:46 "Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day"

 And  we're winning??
1976 2018-02-05 21:24:44 Do yall really know about stocks or yall just kno about crypto and dow?.
1977 2018-02-05 21:24:44 @CNN @ABC @NYTIMES @WASHINGTONPOST @MSNBC @CBSNEWS @FOXNEWS @cnbc @FoxBusiness
Businesses  can not invest in Saturday nite investment promises. Your 401k and STOCKS will take a he'll of beating.  Jerry Maguire said show me the money. Businesses saying Trump show me the businesses
1978 2018-02-05 21:24:43 The Fed hiked rates...the yield curve flattened, but all rates went higher...interest rate sensitive stocks sold off..leading the indices to sell off..so risk parity funds reduced positions (sold stocks and bonds)...which triggered CTA's to unwind (sell stocks, buy bonds)...boom
1979 2018-02-05 21:24:38 Its the opposite,  crypto sell off , spilling over onto stock market. Problem is money flowing out of crypto and stocks , but we dont know where it is parked. Hedge funds ? Futures ?
1980 2018-02-05 21:24:32 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600  points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading  day.
1981 2018-02-05 21:24:27 @MSNBC this is result of foreign government buying our stocks to keep @realDonaldTrump in power now taking their money out the sanction is not signed job well done @SpeakerRyan @CNNMony it was said last week that Trump will tweet something to distract and Russia will sellout
1982 2018-02-05 21:24:27 YOo HOoo!!!  @realDonaldTrump !  Come out, come out wherever you are and take responsibility for the steep sell off in stocks.
1983 2018-02-05 21:24:24 If stocks going up was trump's success...then this plummet of historic numbers is his fault!
1984 2018-02-05 21:24:19 Think the #TrumpGOP will take credit?
"U.S. stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling nearly 1,600 points at its lows - the biggest intraday point drop in history ." Reuters
1985 2018-02-05 21:24:18 Not particularly, more than a trillion has been wiped off the markets. But it was also a long time coming, stocks have been super overheated for such a long time that many were predicting a 10% correction and so far it's 8%. It's inevitable basically
1986 2018-02-05 21:24:13 I think you might want to take another look at the 1920s if you think laissez faire means booming stocks forever. Pay close attention to 1929.
1987 2018-02-05 21:24:04 I said you cant have rising rates and rising stocks. At least one is false. Well you can have falling rates and falling stocks. 10yr Treasury yield falling, S&P -5.4% today
1988 2018-02-05 21:24:03 It's all coming crashing down.   I'm betting they believe because they don't own stocks the loss today doesn't impact them & then when they lose their jobs it'll be the Dems fault somehow someway   Can't teach stupid
1989 2018-02-05 21:24:03 OH! I KNOW THIS! It’s because people are selling more stocks than they’re buying, right??
1990 2018-02-05 21:23:59 The Dow Jones dipping 1,150 points is a positive thing because it will shake out all of the overvalued stocks.

Clueless liberals are claiming that it's "Trump's fault" even though they said "Trump has nothing to do with the booming stock market" for an entire year.
1991 2018-02-05 21:23:53 If your society is constantly churning through asset bubbles (real estate, stocks, derivatives, bitcoin) it’s a reliable signal that your tax structure is mistakenly skewed towards the top. Too much “stupid money” sloshing around where already wealthy people can afford to gamble.
1992 2018-02-05 21:23:53 Fiat money and stocks don't have intrinsec value also. But unlike fiat money and stocks, bitcoin has a limited supply and doesn't give a shit about human factor risk.
1993 2018-02-05 21:23:51 Isn't this just a correction looking at all of the gains from 2017 regarding stocks  or is this more than that
1994 2018-02-05 21:23:48 StockMarket is down dont panic this is a market correction profit takers will sell and take money but if you are a long term investor like me this is not a problem it will rise as stocks slightly cheaper people will buy.
1995 2018-02-05 21:23:48 The stock market has crashed 5% today guys. Don’t be scared though this is good news if you are dollar cost averaging into the S&P 500 every month. Stock market crashes are the BEST times to buy stocks; don’t forget.
1996 2018-02-05 21:23:45 The economy is no different than last week. When the bond traders stop dumping, it's going to bounce back. Bond traders we're locked at 2.5%. They saw 5.4% 1st quarter growth so they are going to cash and will jump into stocks.
1997 2018-02-05 21:23:42 No big deal, or is it?
We still plan to buy some Stocks (Blue Chips +10 Years) end of February so it's just a little discount for us.
1998 2018-02-05 21:23:41 obama won reelection, biggest drop in stocks the next week ever!

eagles won superbowl, biggest drop in stocks the next day ever!

dwayne johnson comes out of the closet, sales of dirty homosexual videos decline!
1999 2018-02-05 21:23:40 How are those stocks, doin, Dumb Donnie?
2000 2018-02-05 21:23:40 Damn What the hell is going on  with these stocks. #AllRed !!!!! Arghhhh
2001 2018-02-05 21:23:38 Stocks are the new Bitcoin.

2004 2018-02-05 21:23:33 You might want to remove this from auto-tweet. Stocks have been tanking since last week.
2005 2018-02-05 21:23:28 Everyone should buy up stocks like crazy right now, don’t panic because the globalist want you to sell off so they can buy your stock at a lower price, this is billionaires manipulating the global stock market, buy now and screw them over.
2006 2018-02-05 21:23:26 Doesn't make sense...October 29,1929 would be the biggest with a lot of stocks not selling at any price.
2007 2018-02-05 21:23:26 When the stocks go up credit Trump. When they go down blame Obama.
2008 2018-02-05 21:23:23 Also, $VIX short interest was at a record high = huge short blow out there is relative to short cover = sell stocks, sell EVERYTHING to make up the hedge = #PerfectStorm
2009 2018-02-05 21:23:22 I've heard about it as well. Also more #BadNews: Stocks went down about 1,000 points....Another #StockMarketCrash what's your reaction?
2010 2018-02-05 21:23:22 I think it's an adjustment to the market, stocks were overpriced. Plus, all the other "stuff" that effects the market.
2011 2018-02-05 21:23:21 I was kicking myself for not throwing some money towards my Roth IRA last weekend after Friday's dip, but lo and behold I've got a chance to buy stocks for slightly cheaper today!
2012 2018-02-05 21:23:20 what do @POTUS and his supporters have to say about stocks today?
2013 2018-02-05 21:23:19 At a 4% loss, my stocks automatically convert to scratch offs.
2014 2018-02-05 21:23:18 Trump claims United Democrat effort to sell stocks cause Republicans wealth to slump greatly in drastic attempt to destroy Trumps market gains.
2015 2018-02-05 21:23:15 Fuck can't believe my stocks took a big hit 
2016 2018-02-05 21:23:13 Big ups to President Business for getting us a great deal on stocks!
2017 2018-02-05 21:23:10 And our stocks are going way down.  The Biggest loss in one day ever!
2018 2018-02-05 21:23:07 its on you TRUMP for you to take credit for the economy is a joke we are only going to see what you have done this year and look at the stocks you have run them in the ground just like you have run the  country in  the ground promise tax cuts to the that people are temp corp perm
2019 2018-02-05 21:23:06 With the down down 1100 today investors are asking”Are stocks a ponzi scheme scam”?- Mainstream Media
2020 2018-02-05 21:23:03 Please don't sell all your stocks
2021 2018-02-05 21:23:03 @POTUS. Time to resign!  You’re killing our stocks and the reputation of our good citizens. LEAVE. Go back to your motherland...Russia!
2022 2018-02-05 21:23:01 انا أقول سلم على الكوس باجر بو عاليه .. و لا شو رايك ..
2023 2018-02-05 21:23:01 How dare you not invest in America... Selling stocks is now an action punishable by death, stock market is booming.
2024 2018-02-05 21:22:58 Why tf did all the stocks just go down?
2025 2018-02-05 21:22:57 Stocks not gold though
2026 2018-02-05 21:22:53 I still firmly believe ryo made all of his money by fucking around with stocks
2027 2018-02-05 21:22:53 Rich people investing order: bonds, stocks, small stocks, startups, crypto...rich people panic sell order is just reversed...(95% of Bitcoin is in 4% investors hands)
2028 2018-02-05 21:22:50 Going to go over the #Indexes tonight and where possible support may be. Also going to get into some #Stocks and where I am looking for support. Don’t hit the panic button yet, this is healthy!
2029 2018-02-05 21:22:49 Fluctuations in the bond market because of fear of Inflation. Market analysts are saying it’s a market “correction” for the stocks
2030 2018-02-05 21:22:46 Holding unnecessary stocks. If you have to hold the bits for several hundred cars that's an awful lot of your cash flow tied up - to say nothing of the storage areas etc. necessary.
2031 2018-02-05 21:22:41 My view on hedging is owning multiple asset classes. I own real estate, bonds, cds, gold, silver, stocks, cash, crypto, ect. So whatever is doing bad, I buy (contrarian). Then I hold or sell if something moons. I never live in fear because SOMETHING I own will always be up.
2032 2018-02-05 21:22:29 I always felt that the stock market doesn't always defy gravity. #StockMarket #stocks
2033 2018-02-05 21:22:27 It’s not that bad Lexie. Stocks are just autocorrecting after suspicious growth these last few months.
2034 2018-02-05 21:22:22 What stocks are you thinking?
2035 2018-02-05 21:22:17 Is @realDonaldTrump not taking credit for today’s Dow stocks slump? I guess maxing out the government credit cards in the hope of creating a short term bubble was an abysmal failure. Like the man himself.
2036 2018-02-05 21:22:14 Stocks down over 1000pts today. Care to take credit for this as well @realDonaldTrump ? I mean, you were so quick to jump on when things were already hot. How about now? How about your tax cuts are bankrupting the country at an historic rate? Care to comment?
2037 2018-02-05 21:22:13 Anyone think Shiffty's veiled threats about an Oklahoma style attack influenced the stock market today? Last time the stocks took a deep plunge a Dem was behind the tumble. These thugs would like nothing better than to collapse our 401k & crush our economy. They hate all of us.
2038 2018-02-05 21:22:06 Chatted with my sister last week about making sure her financial planner had reallocated her portfolio because the rise in stocks wasn't built on sales figures, or expansions, or new products.
2039 2018-02-05 21:22:00 Everyone please take a deep breath regarding the stock market. A lot of profit taking going on right now. Keep in mind the only way to make money off stocks is to actually sell them at some point. Now would be a good to time to sneak in and do some buying if your able. #buynow
2040 2018-02-05 21:21:58 ~ i dont know what stocks are ~
2041 2018-02-05 21:21:58 How about u go f yourself because I do have stocks unlike some people & losers like yourself said the same thing in 2008 when we saw it coming! When the #Dow drops down to 1200 there's a problem! So how about u go & watch a few videos & learn something!
2042 2018-02-05 21:21:57 @TeamCavuto that guy you have on talking about stocks! Idiot...it’s propped up Fake they won’t let it fall! Calling the infancy of crypto craziness? Wow what an uninformed lying tool! The market is dangerously propped up by central banks!
2043 2018-02-05 21:21:54 You are hoping that stocks go down further?

2045 2018-02-05 21:21:45 Ouch better check stocks
2046 2018-02-05 21:21:43 How is Bitcoin anything other than a high risk gamble like stocks and shares. Lloyds stoping customers paying seems a bit like closing ranks.
2047 2018-02-05 21:21:40 It’s not their fault nor is it his. This is economics, it’s a rollercoaster not a straight road going up. Seriously why do you guy think that theirs only one way for the stocks and that’s up?
2048 2018-02-05 21:21:29 Congratulations, Noodles. You were the lone green in an ugly sea of red among restaurant stocks. Woof. $NDLS
2049 2018-02-05 21:21:28 just invested my life savings in stocks time to log on and see how the market’s doing
2050 2018-02-05 21:21:28 If you don't feel like buying some stocks today, your allocation wasn't right. I'm not saying you should, but you should have the urge.
2051 2018-02-05 21:21:27 True. I trade US biotech stocks and they got a horrible beating today, well no, the last couple of days. I am 12% down in less than 10 days. So, I know how you feel. I am sorry.
2052 2018-02-05 21:21:24 Yes liberals "The Dow" dropped 1000pts today.  You should sell all your stocks at beginning of day tomorrow while smart people will buy on the dip and make money.  Go hide in your holes you dug in your backyard and prepare for Armageddon.
2053 2018-02-05 21:21:22 Stocks keep going down while my penny stocks just keep goin up #yeet
2054 2018-02-05 21:21:20 Not to be Debby downer but without knowledge it leads to panics it happens in stocks among other places 
2055 2018-02-05 21:21:19 Yeah wait until next year also stocks are doing horrible again
2056 2018-02-05 21:21:18 Sharp market decline setting up Buys in growth stocks. Prepare your list of buys.
2057 2018-02-05 21:21:17 So is now the time to sell or buy stocks? I can never remember how this all works.
2058 2018-02-05 21:21:16 Market needs to introduce lady stocks
2059 2018-02-05 21:21:10 It's a bigger point drop, but a lot of that was people investing in stocks in anticipation of the tax bill, so I'm kinda just waiting and seeing
2060 2018-02-05 21:21:05 People who sell off their stocks are "treasonous"
2061 2018-02-05 21:21:02 Time to buy bitcoin at $7000 !!!
Also time to buy stocks that you have been waiting to buy !!!
2062 2018-02-05 21:20:58 I have some old stocks my family had since the 40s. I don’t buy much.
2063 2018-02-05 21:20:46 Because they are going to buy stocks tomorrow at a bargain.
2064 2018-02-05 21:20:41 @Pick_of_the_Day $AAPL is very cheap in terms of valuation. Gift for those who have eyes to see #Bargain #stocks
2065 2018-02-05 21:20:40 The dollar has fallen like a brick since disaster 45 took office, yes context is great the Dow is a lagging indicator since it only comprises 30 stocks you can't have it both ways.
2066 2018-02-05 21:20:37 Stocks take their largest single day decline ever. How’s that winning going for you @realDonaldTrump #stockmarket#areyoutiredofwinningyet?
2067 2018-02-05 21:20:36 .@realDonaldTrump 

Looks like all your stock market increases were fake also. Fake just long enuf for you to make a buck anyhow. I'd like to know what stocks you've sold recently, and just what stocks you intend to purchase now.

2068 2018-02-05 21:20:27 Look for stocks who have held up well during the past 8 sessions. These will likely be your stars when a bottom eventually forms. $DECK is just one of many out there. And for what it’s worth energy appears to be in capitulation mode. #waitForConfirmation and #followThrough
2069 2018-02-05 21:20:26 Either that or it's my fault for moving my $1.50 out of stocks and into bonds? 
2070 2018-02-05 21:20:24 I'm liking @leighperfin's idea of rolling my stocks over to Vanguard today but I realize that I don't like doubling my expenses. Do I carry on adding dividend investments or just stop where we are....
2071 2018-02-05 21:20:24 #Canadian #Stocks #RRSP suffer the Trudeau Effect, example;

From Jan. 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2017, the Canadian ETF rose by only 6.8 per cent versus 26.3 % for the U.S. And 2017 was a year of co-ordinated global expansion!
2072 2018-02-05 21:20:18 Wow! So much for how well stocks were doing.  Well at least it only wiped out the gains so far.  Let’s hope for a better week or else Trump will have to find something else to take credit for.  #NYSE
2073 2018-02-05 21:20:09 Or increasing interest rates or potential constitutional crisis? Let's see how long it lasts...but I'm sure as hell getting selling more vulnerable stocks
2074 2018-02-05 21:20:06 Yes, everyone, dive in and buy these stocks with your $2,000 bonus.

Will be interesting to see how many people have the confidence in #DOTUS to do this.

This isn't (yet) "It's a Wonderful Life".

Final small print : Confidence (ie. stock prices) Can Go DOWN as well as up.
2075 2018-02-05 21:20:04 Not at all...  It was expected. The market will continue to correct as inflation mounts.   Look for interest rate hikes and a movement from stocks to bonds.  Also wage increases, which are long overdue.
2076 2018-02-05 21:19:59 Stocks! #business #finance
2077 2018-02-05 21:19:59 its true, but I'm looking at it this way: If I have anything extra I can put into the market and buy into the stocks Ive been watching while they're down, It may be a good time to seriously consider that.  when it bounces back it could bounce back with a vengeance!
2078 2018-02-05 21:19:56 Final damage tally:

Dow -4.6%
S&P -4.1
Nasdaq -3.8
Russell 2000 -3.4
Russell microcap -3.1

Note that smaller stocks held up far better than blue chips. But the blue chips have been leading the mkt over the last year, so some investors were dumping their biggest winners.
2079 2018-02-05 21:19:53 @realDonaldTrump Hey Donald have you seen the market today...So bet you didn't know stocks go both ways.
2080 2018-02-05 21:19:45 After a Year Run-up in Stocks—The Largest Institutions are Taking Profits! Prices Will Still Bounce—Where the Largest Unfilled Limit Buy orders are! When the Institutions Will Continue the Buying from there-is Anyone’s guess!!  #MarketTimer
2081 2018-02-05 21:19:43 Someone had better give the #racist #Clown in orange makeup a bit of advice. Stop bashing the #patriots at the #FBI and do your job! The #Trumpanzees don't own stocks, but that's how the #Bush economic downfall of 2007 occurred, #WallStreet first. Your #DayOfReckoning is coming!
2082 2018-02-05 21:19:41 I've been buying since early Jan. Too bad I didn't wait a bit longer. Just transferred a bunch money to buy more stocks.
2083 2018-02-05 21:19:39 modern day punishment is being put in stocks and forced to read my tweets
2084 2018-02-05 21:19:37 I moved my stocks just in time. Goddamn.
2085 2018-02-05 21:19:34 yeah when stocks do well, wealthy people make more money with their capital and i get nothing, but when stocks do poorly i lose my job 
2086 2018-02-05 21:19:33 We all knew a US stock market crash was coming given that this has been the longest period without a market crash since the 1920s. Will this be a boon to #cryptocurrency though? Will people actually put money in #crypto rather than lose it in the stock market? #bitcoin #stocks
2087 2018-02-05 21:19:33 White House not in crisis...

voice of truth..know some facts

Sell offs expected after 40%+ gains. Actually good thing in healthy market.

Good indicators can bring on inflation, higher interest rates

Stocks still up 5000 points since Obama left office.
2088 2018-02-05 21:19:31 Sanders has already commented that the mkt really wasn’t down. Server malfunction. Stocks were flat on the day., actually. *And the SOTU had the highest TV rating ever*
2089 2018-02-05 21:19:30 I would agree except the majority of 45 voters don’t own stocks.
2090 2018-02-05 21:19:28 $DIA diving after hours. If we get another vacuum like whoosh down tomorrow I may buy another basket of stocks for a quick trade. But this is no time to be a hero. Dangerous tape.
2091 2018-02-05 21:19:14 Stocks are on sale!!!
2092 2018-02-05 21:19:13 When the nightly news scares all the baby boomers into selling their retirement plan stocks, that's when the rally starts right?
2093 2018-02-05 21:19:11 As predicted, when @POTUS had the Dow Jones climbing to record highs, it was all Obama. Now markets are selling, it’s all because of @realDonaldTrump. Any market is a gamble and the stocks are frickle. We’ll see what the final number is in 2024. #MAGA
2094 2018-02-05 21:19:09 Now this is when you have to start being smart with your money markets are a leading indicator. Everyone knew the markets would have to stabilize sooner or later but this also means it’s close to buying more stocks at low prices.
2095 2018-02-05 21:19:08 US stocks plunge the most since 2011, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points, as the equity selloff reached a fever pitch amid rising concern that inflation will force interest rates higher. - Bloomberg
2096 2018-02-05 21:19:07 Stocks are up 6k or 32% since the election.
2097 2018-02-05 21:19:04 Why don’t you? What about my stocks?
2098 2018-02-05 21:19:02 Today was the biggest #stockmarket point decline in history. Who saved money on the sidelines and bought stock today?  #DowJones #StockMarketCrash #stocks
2099 2018-02-05 21:19:00 stocks will always go back up... depending on what you're invested in. IDK what kind of hit it is or what caused it. i'm scared to find out. lol
2100 2018-02-05 21:18:59 Honestly, both Finance and Energy stocks were overpriced
2101 2018-02-05 21:18:59 It would be interesting to see which stocks were shorted during this #DowJones drop. 
2102 2018-02-05 21:18:58 Just checked my portfolio. Everything is a bloodbath ... except marijuana and hospital stocks. Hmmmmm. I guess we're gonna need both of those?
2103 2018-02-05 21:18:46 Corrections (or apparent soon-to-be ones) sure come fast these days. #stocks
2104 2018-02-05 21:18:41 The stock market is way overpriced!! Look at  P/E of stocks like Caterpillar (120), American Express (32) or Honeywell (72).  Too much hype from Trump & GOP last year. This year reality will set in. It may not be pretty.

#deadlinewh @AliVelshi @NicolleDWallace #DowJones
2105 2018-02-05 21:18:41 I just want to take a moment to congratulate @realDonaldTrump and his GOP on a record breaking day in the stock market! Today was the biggest single day drop in points in stock market history!  Way to go, Dummy Don! 
#StockMarket #stocks #Dow #Trump #GOP
2106 2018-02-05 21:18:39 Look everyone, Trump lowered the price of stocks so the average working Joe can afford to buy in!
2107 2018-02-05 21:18:38 Love how CNN described today's Dow disaster by saying "stocks gyrated wildly throughout the day." The notion of shimmying stocks makes the fact that our economy is falling into the crapper a lot easier to take and considerably more entertaining.
2108 2018-02-05 21:18:38 Mr President. What is happening to the Stock Market. Down almost 1200 points. Do something. You are the President. Fire those people who are Falsely Selling off stocks. Hire Ms Yelling back to stabilize the Federal Reserve. Don’t just sit back and do nothing
2109 2018-02-05 21:18:34 $WFC had to unload risky assets...stocks
2110 2018-02-05 21:18:33 @realDonaldTrump why did you make stocks go down?
2111 2018-02-05 21:18:31 $AMD has fallen below $12, that's a buy... Too bad everyone is selling everything. #Stocks
2112 2018-02-05 21:18:30 $TLT closed green, the bond washout ended few hours before stocks...
2113 2018-02-05 21:18:27 So who is @realDonaldTrump going to blame for the Stocks now? 
2114 2018-02-05 21:18:23 So much for the diversification argument-- bitcoin down 14% on the worst day for stocks in nearly 2 years.
2115 2018-02-05 21:18:20 Does Wall Street know something bad about the economy that no one else does? That seems to be the only reason they'd sell stocks at a historic pace.
2116 2018-02-05 21:18:17 liberals dumping stocks ? george soros ? what the heck is going on ?
2117 2018-02-05 21:18:15 @realDonaldTrump hey. what's up with those stocks? I thought you had this covered.
2118 2018-02-05 21:18:14 The liberal elite model of fool the people into thinking food stamps and part-time jobs can stimulate the economy b/c stocks are high ...does not work at this stage.
2119 2018-02-05 21:18:13 Looking at my stocks drop and glad I have a balanced portfolio.
2120 2018-02-05 21:18:13 To put this in perspective, stocks dropped to levels not seen since.....just before Christmas. We had a ridiculous run-up.
2121 2018-02-05 21:18:12 #stockmarketcrashingtrump how are your stocks doing trump?
2122 2018-02-05 21:18:12 I love buying stocks. Think I'll go out and buy some stocks right now. Join me in venturing to the Stock Bodega
2123 2018-02-05 21:18:11 @jillybobww [enterChicagoFireSuperFanMode] YO, I love adding in the Hazmat teams...spices up the calls. ALSO where can I find myself a Severide-who-I-can-live-with-platonically-at-first-who-stocks-frozen-pizza-and-also-takes-me-to-fancy-galas THXBYE [exitChicagoFireSuperFanMode]
2124 2018-02-05 21:18:07 @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @nenefled @JacksonLeeTX18 @SebGorka @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @rushlimbaugh @foxandfriends @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews 
Wow!!! So it was Obama's work that was rising our stocks so high...so where did he screw up to start this stock drop????
2125 2018-02-05 21:18:03 Dumbass libtard doesn't understand concept about buying stocks when they are low and sell when they are high.

This correction was inevitable considering how the market has gained since the election. 

Markets fluctuate.
2126 2018-02-05 21:18:02 My boss stocks the back room w snacks for us including CHOCOLATEDRIZZKE RICE KRISPY TREATS and she wants me to add her on co-star I love???? Her?
2127 2018-02-05 21:18:02 The stock market is way overpriced!! Look at  P/E of stocks like Caterpillar (120), American Express (32) or Honeywell (72).  Too much hype from Trump & GOP last year. This year reality will set in. It may not be pretty.
2128 2018-02-05 21:18:00 Congrats Trump, another record. I’m sure he’ll take credit for the loses like he did for the gains. “Stocks plunged in highly volatile trading, with the Dow falling nearly 1,600 points at its lows - the biggest intraday point drop in history.” #mtpol
2129 2018-02-05 21:17:59 You know who else thought stocks were bad? Medieval prisoners. Thank you. This has been a topical joke.
2130 2018-02-05 21:17:55 Only HALF as many #stocks in the #market to chose from as were just 20 years ago.

Everything is more #correlated, fund of funds: #MutualFunds, #ETF, #quant, #AI... than ever before.

#FlashCrash potential terrifing.

#StockMarket never designed to be #Americas retirement plan!
2131 2018-02-05 21:17:55 [Markets update] US stocks closed down sharply after chaotic trading today, erasing their gains for the year, even as bond markets recovered.
Dow Jones $DJIA closed down 1,175 pts, or -4.6%.
S&P 500  $SPX -4.1% - its worst percentage fall since August 2011
Nasdaq -3.8%.
Vix 35.3
2132 2018-02-05 21:17:52 That day makes a little more sense. The equity market needs to go down more than the commodity stocks.
2133 2018-02-05 21:17:51 Well, at least "stocks" replaced "memo" in majority of headlines today...
2134 2018-02-05 21:17:48 Hey, @SpeakerRyan,

This keeps up, and that school secretary will be able to buy some stocks at a great value with that extra $1.50 a week! #MAGA
2135 2018-02-05 21:17:44 That's okay. That just means stocks are on sale tomorrow.
2136 2018-02-05 21:17:41 Today was business as usual in the mining sector/stocks. Lots of green and a few slight declines. No panic here.
2137 2018-02-05 21:17:32 I don't understand stocks. What's going on?
2138 2018-02-05 21:17:28 Things are great.  Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
2139 2018-02-05 21:17:26 This is why the stocks are tanking. FISA memo down 665. More memos Rothschild sell off of assets or was it seized by eo? massive stock drop as result.
2140 2018-02-05 21:17:25 Stocks are going up for these people? Not today sir
2141 2018-02-05 21:17:25 During Obama Era, interest rates were low and stocks were higher - while wages, economic growth were timid - yet game has changed. Yellen is out, tax cuts is here, optimism is alive & well among business owners and job creators.
2142 2018-02-05 21:17:19 2/5/18 Market Overview: Dow: 24,345.75 (-1,175); NASDAQ: 6,967.53 (-273.42); S&P 500: 2,648.94(-113.19) #stocks #finance
2143 2018-02-05 21:17:15 Democrats sold in record numbers buy the stocks now even a few.
2144 2018-02-05 21:17:12 It looks like the high stocks took a hit. Witch was good it will make it more affordable.
2145 2018-02-05 21:17:11 do you actual have any stocks? have you shown proof of such?
2146 2018-02-05 21:17:10 #Perspective: While today was single largest point decline ever for #DowJones at 1,100 points that is only 4.6% percent of value. Far cry from biggest one day percentage loss 10/19/1987, when Dow closed down 22.61%.

#Stocks #StockMarket
2147 2018-02-05 21:17:08 RIP to the stocks
2148 2018-02-05 21:17:07 Is BAMBOOZLED a strong enough word to describe what's happening to stocks right now?
2149 2018-02-05 21:17:02 Worst intraday drop in history! Congrats, #POTUS! #DowJones #dow #StockMarket #crash #StockMarketCrash #futures #NYSE #DonTheCon #Stockstowatch #stocks #history #stocks @realDonaldTrump #
2150 2018-02-05 21:17:01 You sweet girl....thank you! Question for you: are you buying some good stocks at bargain prices today  My poor hubby got stopped out on quite a few today! 
2151 2018-02-05 21:17:01 Yeah let's all avoid the memo, and focus on the stocks. Are you people kidding me?!?!?
2152 2018-02-05 21:16:58 Bitcoin price drops.. It's a scam..get out!    U.S. stocks plunged the most in 6 1/2 years....silence :-D :-D
2153 2018-02-05 21:16:58 Good to see some proper correction finally take place, the more it drops the more attractive stocks become. Considerable drop today but honestly nothing ridiculous especially after 404 days without correction >5%.
2154 2018-02-05 21:16:55 "Dow Jones" goes back to 20,000 before it will see 30,000. #Stocks Over bought #FROTHY It's either GREE or FEAR and it looks like profit taking and correction time. This will go on longer then two days. A bump up then another #LEG down.
2155 2018-02-05 21:16:54 My stocks are up today, binch
2156 2018-02-05 21:16:53 I don't trade normal stocks but I'm thinking I might, I'd just have to quit my day job first.
2157 2018-02-05 21:16:52 If I didn't have vet bills pouring out my ears I would be flinging a couple hundred at stocks right now though. Damn.
2158 2018-02-05 21:16:49 I wonder how Mr Jordan is feeling tonight?  SNB stocks and dollar position not as good as it looked this morning. #forex
2159 2018-02-05 21:16:47 Thank you - VPA book was the first & does include some forex. Check out the follow books of VPA examples on Amazon - one for FX & the other specifically for stocks.
2160 2018-02-05 21:16:42 First day of the week and stocks tumbling like CRAZY
2161 2018-02-05 21:16:40 Yohh..... that plunge in the DOW though... Is it to late for me to start The Big Short-ing stocks?
2162 2018-02-05 21:16:38 Did it fall because Brady got stripped with two minutes remaining? Not a stocks guy
2163 2018-02-05 21:16:26 Good thing i'm too poor to buy stocks
2164 2018-02-05 21:16:24 Trump's base doesn't actually own any stocks or mutual funds. They invest their money in Bond-o so they can eventually repair the car on their front lawn.
2165 2018-02-05 21:16:19 Stocks rose 6000 points. They forgot to mention that. Adjustments will always happen. Let’s watch in weeks to come. Will you cover it when it goes right back up?
2166 2018-02-05 21:16:14 This shows how unstable the economy was during Obama’s term the feds didn’t raise interest rates because economy wasn’t strong enough now the feds are raising rates which equals a strong economic future the DOW Jones has needed a correction the stocks were inflated under Obama
2167 2018-02-05 21:16:10 stocks are where they were in nov 2017
2168 2018-02-05 21:16:09 Mr. Dow Jones apparently lost lots of money this week.  I'm still investigating but my first instinct is that he should have put his money into stocks like I did.  #DowJones
2169 2018-02-05 21:16:05 People need to realize that the #DJIA fell because the economy is doing well. Good economy leads to higher rates on bonds so people will sell stocks to move money into the less risky option. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
2170 2018-02-05 21:16:03 THIS IS GOOD NEWS. Upcoming increased interest rates signal businesses have (finally) converted productivity gains to investment, hiring, and wage increases. Controlling inflation is good. I'm sorry if 100% of your money is in stocks or speculative assets like crypto, idiot.
2171 2018-02-05 21:16:02 Stock Market finally is correcting itself. Buy while it's low. Don't sell!! People who know nothing about stocks are freaking out or making jokes about President Trump. Higher wages, new interest rates coming etc. Contribute to the correction. Not Trump. No big deal. Buy, I did.
2172 2018-02-05 21:15:57 you need to own stocks to sell them cletus
2173 2018-02-05 21:15:55 I just checked my stocks just now and well, my future is over.
2174 2018-02-05 21:15:53 I noticed. All my stocks are down. Motherf*cker #gop
2175 2018-02-05 21:15:49 Are investors trying to sure up their balance sheets as their Bitcoin losses mount.
#stocks #Bitcoin
2176 2018-02-05 21:15:48 #DowJones: 'for its largest single-day point decline ever'

Thank you, @realDonaldTrump.

#StockMarket #StockMarketWatch #Stocks #Dow
2177 2018-02-05 21:15:47 Keep Calm and Invest On.
This is part of a long-time coming correction. As @kairyssdal often reminds us, the stock market is not the economy. 

@Marketplace #DowJones #StockMarket #Stocks
2178 2018-02-05 21:15:47 Well since the Dow is only 30 stocks you tumpist would say it's still up 33% but since the dollar has been falling like bricks since disaster 45 took office the crash is starting and that is all on him.
2179 2018-02-05 21:15:47 ya idk man at least i have 4 stocks
2180 2018-02-05 21:15:45 That the Clinton Foundation and Obama Foundation colluded with Canada to artificially inflate the stock market then dump all their stocks at once to give Trump the record for largest daily DOW drool ever.
2181 2018-02-05 21:15:45 But what about all my stocks??? #MAGA #StockMarket
2182 2018-02-05 21:15:45 Dow suffers biggest point drop ever as stocks close broadly lower
2183 2018-02-05 21:15:44 Any comment about the Dow Jones being down 1000 points in one day, 2000 points since Friday Jan 26, & it's biggest drop since 2011? #Dow #DowJones #DJIA #stocks #Trump
2184 2018-02-05 21:15:41 @realDonaldTrump 

Where are your tweets cheering the economy?  i mean, i know stocks don't reflect that but in your twisted mind they do...so you need to take the good with the bad, dummy.
2185 2018-02-05 21:15:37 Someone please ask Stable Genius Donald Trump, how the stock market works, or even something as basic as the difference between stocks and bonds. His response will be hilarious and in these dark times, we could all use a laugh.
2186 2018-02-05 21:15:29 At the start of year...I thought through this & fired a view that 
1)US long end rates go up first
2)as long end rates break to new high US stocks crack

I put on a bond short trade which worked. I unwound it a day before FOMC.

What I didn't do was to short ES
2187 2018-02-05 21:15:29 Stocks are crashing and so is Bitcoin.
Sad day for us middle-class Americans.
2188 2018-02-05 21:15:27 Can someone explain to me, because I don't really understand stocks, why it's dropping so much? I am inclined to not panic but it still seems sketchy.
2189 2018-02-05 21:15:23 Outgoing Fed Chair and past globalist stoking stock market fears for political reasons. Don’t buy the bullshit bubble talk. Stocks have been undervalued for some time and should be sitting around 27,000. Will clearer heads prevail or will they take it down to 18,000?
2190 2018-02-05 21:15:20 The 2 year treasuries interest rate has jumped up to 2.58 % making them more attractive an investments than many stocks Its related to the declining value of the dollar against other currencys
2191 2018-02-05 21:15:17 Believe me, stocks have never dropped this fast in the history of stocks. It’s fantastic. People are saying...
2192 2018-02-05 21:15:17 @cvpayne we going to buy stocks in the morning. 
2193 2018-02-05 21:15:14 Thanks Jim!!!  Since you always have great advice, just checked stocks and not doing too bad.
2194 2018-02-05 21:15:11 Don't you find it strange that under Trump there were 90 record setting days on Wall street and the supposedly objective press ignored them all.  And now after a few days of tumbling stocks, there's wall to wall coverage that "the sky is falling" .
2195 2018-02-05 21:15:08 @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr 
Tax breaks hard at WORK 
#GOPrecession
@realDonaldTrump takes credit when stocks soar you get the BLAME when it crashes 
#trumpMarketCrash
2196 2018-02-05 21:15:07 Hey look, cheap Bitcoin and stocks!
2197 2018-02-05 21:15:05 In just one day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,200 points, the largest single contraction in its history. Our economy, whilst strong, has numerous underlying instabilities that are causing stocks to crash.
2198 2018-02-05 21:14:57 Another gut check for stocks today...mortgage rates should improve some!
2199 2018-02-05 21:14:54 @DonaldTrump crashed the market Stocks all tumbled! Just kidding
2200 2018-02-05 21:14:51 Crash has just begun. Asian stocks will follow. And US will again fall.
2201 2018-02-05 21:14:50 Today is an exciting day for long term investors. Today is like Black Friday sales! Need to hold on to your cash for cyber Monday too. More bear to come. Always remember to look for value stocks!
2202 2018-02-05 21:14:47 @mitchellvii yes but the stocks was losing last week also and what happened in 2008 all the working and retirement class was talked into leaving there money and 401k's invested cause people told them to and what happened bellyup they lost all there retirement money Think People.
2203 2018-02-05 21:14:44 So did people pile into bonds this afternoon because stocks are falling because inflation’s about to pick up?
2204 2018-02-05 21:14:42 I think this is a market correct vs a bubble. The market is currently over priced. I think it will dip down a bit lower and regain traction. It's a good time to buy now while stocks are getting more affordable (like buying clothes on sale)
2205 2018-02-05 21:14:39 $AAPL it hold pretty well. Take a look at other tech stocks
2206 2018-02-05 21:14:37 @cvpayne @FoxBusiness @FBNlive Is it Companies reinvesting out of Stocks back into corporate infrastructure?  Psychological nightmare but sign of growing economy?  #StillNotWorried
2207 2018-02-05 21:14:33 Stocks crash as Dow plunges to record lows. Trump tweets that everyone will see more in their paychecks. Guess too bad about your 401k's.
2208 2018-02-05 21:14:30 omg youre trying to twist my words up... if i say some of yall are becoming laughin stocks doesnt mean im referring to all. If it dont apply, let it fly..
2209 2018-02-05 21:14:30 What's nice is at least half the country who don't invest in stocks can laugh today at the other half who do?
2210 2018-02-05 21:14:28 Who are selling stocks on Friday and Monday? It smells  "Economy=Politics". SEC should get in to catch the killjoy.
2211 2018-02-05 21:14:26 News flash. The rise has been steady since 2012. The wage increase was merely 2.9%. Chump change with little impact. The tax savings is buying back their own stocks. This is what is really going on. Keeping your head in the sand is helping no one. #boycottfoxnews
2212 2018-02-05 21:14:26 That buck fitty a week will get you all the stocks. ;-)
2213 2018-02-05 21:14:24 I really think this is China manipulation now in play in both stocks and crypto . China is also squeezing the bond market making it hard for US to ask for more loans . This will lead to the demise of the US dollar .
2214 2018-02-05 21:14:24 Hell, the bump stocks & suboptimal caliber selection probably *saved* lives—some ridiculous % of rounds flew overhead & never hit anyone & .223 & 5.56mm just aren't that lethal (which is why the military has always hated 5.56).
2215 2018-02-05 21:14:22 What does a strongman leader who has taken credit for a rampant bull market do when shares fall? Simple: force brokerages to buy, suspend trading in half of all listed stocks, and blame foreign hedge funds. (Xi Jinping playbook, summer 2015.)
2216 2018-02-05 21:14:17 All my money is going into stocks for now, no more cash for crypto here
2217 2018-02-05 21:14:12 Just remember; it's not a stock market, it's a market of stocks. I'm not a fan of knife catching but this is the time to finalize your list of positions you want to buy and own for the long term. What perfect timing for the deep state. Just as Yellen leaves and Powell transitions
2218 2018-02-05 21:14:05 Not too surprising really. Economy is very strong. Wages & jobs numbers up. Resulted in fed increasing interest rates and this has a negative effect on stocks. Relax everyone.
2219 2018-02-05 21:14:00 Stocks dump to buy btc/alts
2220 2018-02-05 21:13:54 Hi!

Just in case you are actually working ( kidding) and not near a TV (not likely) - you are going to explain to everyone that when the Market is at an all time high thanks to you, the reverse is true also, right?

We’ll wait...

2224 2018-02-05 21:13:40 Stocks have always had the chance of Winning some or Losing some or it is just evening out.  Fake News Outlets would have you believe otherwise....
2225 2018-02-05 21:13:40 Did you tweet when it went up too? lousy reply for sure but just wondering. Some seem giddy that people are losing money just because they hate Trump so much. I like people especially those who save every penny for 401K. Can hate Trump and like the stocks to be up, its possible
2226 2018-02-05 21:13:38 Market was bound to crash give it some time then buy some stocks
2227 2018-02-05 21:13:37 Financial crisis?? Good time to buy bank stocks and yes this is Trumps economy (good OR bad).
2228 2018-02-05 21:13:36 Shocking, stocks are overvalued!
2229 2018-02-05 21:13:34 #trump #StockMarket #stocks let's all watch and see if trump addresses the losses taken in
 the stock market today. He claims all the credit for its rise. But now he won't mention the losses? Or will he? #PresidentTrump
2230 2018-02-05 21:13:32 C'mon big mouth. Why did stocks crash?
2231 2018-02-05 21:13:29 US #stocks fall sharply on Monday. The #Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 1,000 points #WallStreet
2232 2018-02-05 21:13:29 LOL it happened after the job report came in strong. Ironically the market hated seeing wages going UP. That means inflation resulting in interest rates rising in the near future. When that happens people move from stocks to bonds silly.
2233 2018-02-05 21:13:23 @NicolleDWallace Tru Trumps families and ovegarts they hide drup money from heroin tru stocks and banks. there is a plan to steel this money as soon as Mueller starts freezing accounts tied to trump and families..you were given a glimpse on the equalizer movie 2 years in advance
2234 2018-02-05 21:13:23 Because its a great time to buy stocks!
2235 2018-02-05 21:13:18 It's a market correction, your 401k will go back up . Stocks are the highest in history and this is actually a result of a healthy economy.
2236 2018-02-05 21:13:16 Not only that but US stocks are tanking too. Safe to say my portfolio has seen better days. But I don't really care tbh
2237 2018-02-05 21:13:11 I hope the tech stocks take the hardest hit and the Randian tech bros lose everything.
2238 2018-02-05 21:13:09 Via@StephenKing: Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics. @realDonaldTrump #TaxcutFAIL !!!
2239 2018-02-05 21:13:02 Donald took too much credit for the stock market rising in the first place and honestly he can't take too much blame for the fall. This is why watching the stocks is a TERRIBLE way of gauging the health of the economy.
2240 2018-02-05 21:13:01 Not freaking out yet because my stocks still look okay 
2241 2018-02-05 21:13:00 We sold most of our stocks Thursday & Friday. Why?  Rules. Tactics. Sell some into strength.  Sell more into strength. Sell some losing 8 ema. Sell flat losing 20 sma.  #stocks
2242 2018-02-05 21:12:59 The stock markets have ran quite far ahead of the real economy if you look at things like price to earnings ratio etc. That being said it's also "rigged casino" based on supply & demand of stocks vs. other asset classes like bonds. Parabolic rise in price is never good for long.

2245 2018-02-05 21:12:55 Stocks went up cause taxes had a better chance of getting cut which helps the bottom line. Thats why it went up after the election.
2246 2018-02-05 21:12:53 I pride myself on accurate price forecasts for stocks / indexes that i actively pay attention to.

But I'll be the first to admit that today's move across the market was beyond anything I would have predicted.
2247 2018-02-05 21:12:52 Somebody who knows stocks please explain to me what the fuck
2248 2018-02-05 21:12:49 I hope you guys took advantage of cheap stocks today
2249 2018-02-05 21:12:49 you, a fool: worried about your stocks and retirement

me, an intellectual: does not understand the stock market, assumes i will never have enough money to retire
2250 2018-02-05 21:12:47 That being said Trump doesn't deserve all the credit for stocks doing very well either. However you can't deny that many of things that trump has done economic-wise have had an impact on the stock market and the economy at-large.
2251 2018-02-05 21:12:47 If he claimed the rise of stock and the stocks drop it is fair to point out by trump logic that he owns both the rise and fall.
2252 2018-02-05 21:12:42 I just got lectured by an older gentleman for an uncomfortable amount of time about how I need to put my money into cryptocurrency stocks because it’s “the money of the future.” 
2253 2018-02-05 21:12:38 The rotation out of stocks into Treasuries today will end in tears for those who bought bonds. Cash will be king now.  Looking for safety in Treasuries now will prove to be a fool's errand.
2254 2018-02-05 21:12:38 Tonight we will here from the investor crowd that you should be disciplined and diversified.  Ask your portfolio manager what happens to your diversified portfolio if stocks go down with bonds?  Curious what they say to you.
2255 2018-02-05 21:12:33 I thought I was smart 4 months ago moving money to foreign stocks. Well, shit.
2256 2018-02-05 21:12:32 Stocks fell by about a trillion dollars today. My share of the losses are about 0.0000001%, but I might be off by a zero or two in either direction. #StockMarketCrash
2257 2018-02-05 21:12:29 #stock market.Stocks historic plunge due to President Trump . Until now he claimed credit as the market rose. So now as live by the market so .,,
2258 2018-02-05 21:12:26 Remember when neoliberals used to defend stock market by claiming most Americans owned stocks through their pensions and retirement accounts?

Argument doesn't work so well now that most Americans don't have pensions or retirement accounts.
2259 2018-02-05 21:12:23 I play the markets when I have extra cash. I've been out since last summer. Stocks are totally overbought right now. If we go down another 10%, I may jump back in.
2260 2018-02-05 21:12:23 Everyone must've had their money on Tom Brady last night. Now they're liquidating all their stocks.
2261 2018-02-05 21:12:19 or like 1987 with a bond selloff seeping into stocks. Yellen really passed Powell a grenade. all that praise looks pretty hollow now
2262 2018-02-05 21:12:17 Bloody bloody monday. Crypto down, stocks down. :(
2263 2018-02-05 21:12:13 Plus it’s not unusual for people to sell when stocks are high, they’ve made money, now that they are lower people will start buying again.
2264 2018-02-05 21:12:12 Those of you waiting for that stocks turning down ((end times belief)). I just got a notice, it has dropped by 1100 points today.
2265 2018-02-05 21:12:12 I've made stocks cheaper to buy for regular working Americans. Biggest helping working people afford stocks in history.
2266 2018-02-05 21:12:09 So this is the day I've been waiting 4. A true partial #healthy #correction day filled w Volitility $VIX & needed Buying opps Picked up the rest of $NVDA @ the close @ 214.60 just like I advised on Twitter this morn #investments #Invest #Investing #stocks #Stockstowatch #trading
2267 2018-02-05 21:12:08 Stocks tanking and SEC outlook on crypto looks kinda promising
2268 2018-02-05 21:12:07 September 15, 2008. 777.68 was the drop in stocks. In the past 6 days its lost 2,100 points. Do the math.
2269 2018-02-05 21:12:05 How about them stocks
2270 2018-02-05 21:12:04 And stocks are tanking. Dow down 1175.21, -4.60%.  Come on, brag about how this is due to your policies!  You own the tanking just as you claim responsibility for increases you brag about!
2271 2018-02-05 21:12:01 Thanks to the tax cuts, the rich pay less, the very poor pay more, and the country loses . Bond markets react poorly. Stocks way down. Weren’t you talking about the stock market multiple times a week?
2272 2018-02-05 21:11:54 @NicolleDWallace @AliVelshi @DLeonhardt For past 6 mos, I've been astonished by the irrational rise in stocks, despite the Trump. No reason for it, except as continuation of rise during 2 Obama terms.  This remarkable downrun on the roller coaster will astonish even more.
2273 2018-02-05 21:11:47 So where’s twitter boy today - Stocks continued down fall - huge medical cost  increases due to GOP plan, huge tax breaks for rich - middle class gets nothing - Gas prices up, in spite of huge record supplies - Big Oil not bringing back over sea cash - Oh Trumpster liar in Chief
2274 2018-02-05 21:11:46 Great day to buy stocks :) @MatthewPitrola
2275 2018-02-05 21:11:43 How Now, Down Dow
Down Ton Dow Be
401 Not Okay
Stock Slump Trumps Stocks’ Trump Bump

#funwithbadheadlines
2276 2018-02-05 21:11:42 I think of stocks as 30+ year maturity instruments so in my mind T-Bonds are in the same temporal basket when allocating assets, but way less risky.
2277 2018-02-05 21:11:40 The debt is waayyy up. Inflation is rising, obliterating that $1.50 increase in my weekly paycheck. Stocks are DOWN. 
We have lost trade deals with Mexico and Canada, surrendered Asia to China, and are letting Russia get away, 
literally, with murder. Puerto Rico has not power.
2278 2018-02-05 21:11:40 @realDonaldTrump TRUMP TAKES CREDIT FOR GOOD NEWS TRUMP PRAISED HIMSELF ABOUT THE STOCKS BEING SO GOOD TRUMP SAID THE STOCK MARKET HAS RECORD HIGHS BECAUSE OF HIM. TRUMP TODAY THE MARKET HIT RECORD LOWS AT 1600 AT ONE TIME. DOW CLOSED IN THE RED DOWN OVER 1100.THIS IS ON U TRUMP
2279 2018-02-05 21:11:37 @POTUS What’s happening with the stock markets on your watch? Truthful explanation only please. I thought the stocks where going to be great and keep rising under your term. (loosely said)
2280 2018-02-05 21:11:34 Never thought I’d be smiling while stocks plunge. Eat that orange puke.
2281 2018-02-05 21:11:25 The Stock Market is in free fall, you jackass!

2286 2018-02-05 21:11:09 Said Lyin’ Donnie as stocks tanked. Try to keep up, Old Man. #FuckingMoron
2287 2018-02-05 21:11:07 your precious stocks are tanking, you're a complete fauilure. Go crawl back into trash tower, America needs a real president.
2288 2018-02-05 21:11:06 @realDonaldTrump Just curious, you took credit for increase in stock market, who's fault stocks are tanking now??
2289 2018-02-05 21:11:06 Don't forget to take credit for the stock market like you always do when it goes up! How about you buy up all those cheap stocks now and singlehandedly put the market back in the black! #fakebillionaire
2290 2018-02-05 21:11:05 Remember that Trump and his administration are believers of alternative facts.  In their bizarro world, the stocks went up 1,000 points.
2291 2018-02-05 21:11:04 Hold up lying Don..  Stock market just lost 1178 points!  HUGE LOSS IN STOCKS UNDER YOU LITTLE BOY.
2292 2018-02-05 21:11:04 it's a false flag, stocks are actually up ten hundred million percent which in business term is good.
2293 2018-02-05 21:11:02 trump gives rich people giant tax cut...rich assholes begin a selloff in a bloated stock market based on limited regulations for corps...middle class losing out in stocks but that working slobs should be grateful for $1.50 more on paycheck is what @SpeakerRyan and @GOP says...smh

“The TSX isn’t invited in the stock market party. Here’s why” questions why major indexes around the world including the U.S., Europe, Asia and emerging markets are posting double-digit gains while the TSX is almost flat. FINANCIAL POST
2295 2018-02-05 21:10:55 Biggest one-day drop for stocks in U.S. history (in absolute terms)
2296 2018-02-05 21:10:53 I knew stocks were overpriced but hot damn that was a collapse
2297 2018-02-05 21:10:52 Stocks?  Start to look buying on Wednesday
2298 2018-02-05 21:10:50 Analysts have been pretty clear it's in large part due to Friday's strong salary report, which is a dark enough reason for stocks to go soft w/o the need for some treason conspiracy theory.
2299 2018-02-05 21:10:47 It’s time to buy more stocks 
2300 2018-02-05 21:10:41 #US stocks plunged the most in 6 and a half years, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1100 points! #Treasuries rallied and gold rose on have demand!
2301 2018-02-05 21:10:35 It sure felt like it at 1 point this afternoon Katie...the Dow fell by almost 1,600 pts at the lows...the hope is that calmer heads prevail...stocks will go down...it'd just be better & healthier if it's a more orderly pullback
2302 2018-02-05 21:10:34 Stocks have never* declined between 1-6 months after the VIX has jumped more than 50% in one day.

* Small sample size
2303 2018-02-05 21:10:25 Lost $25k in profit. I have some end of February/March expiration that aren’t looking too good. Will start opening some bearish position to profit on the current market condition.  #sick #morditrades #stocks #Crashing
2304 2018-02-05 21:10:24 If I save my extra tax money for a month, I can buy a 20oz. Pepsi...a whole 20 oz. Pepsi...oh, wait!  My stocks lost $50...never mind.  With my extra tax money I get to try and recoop my lost stock money.
2305 2018-02-05 21:10:23 When I flew to the US two weeks ago immigration official saw me looking at stocks as asked me what to invest in. I said it’s better to pay of debts because at the moment (ie its top and there’s a correction coming ) .  Feeling good about that one.
2306 2018-02-05 21:10:19 Stocks keep dropping, thanks Trump.
2307 2018-02-05 21:10:17 Because Trump Brags about the stocks when they're up.  If he feels he's the cause of them going up, then he gets to be the cause when they go down.  Personally, I believe the movement of the DOW/economy have very little to do with him, whether good or bad.
2308 2018-02-05 21:10:15 You gonna try and blame @POTUS44 for the stocks nose-diving today? You;re a special kind of dotard.
2309 2018-02-05 21:10:10 Trump is CRAZY, stocks down because of his attacks, so no confidence in this administration.
2310 2018-02-05 21:10:10 People sold stocks today to cover their Super Bowl gambling losses.  Simple.
2311 2018-02-05 21:10:08 Dems be saying “ But, but ...my environmental portfolio ? Why is my solar panel corporate stock plunging? This isn’t fair.” Surprise!! Republicans: “I’m gonna retire early, take my Koch money, and buy some Russian gas and oil stocks. Party hardy!”
2312 2018-02-05 21:10:06 Not only did I lose money on the Pats, the stock market is in a free fall. T's and P's to the bank account  #stocks
2313 2018-02-05 21:10:05 Soros might be playing some games along with his pals . He is the master of manipulating stocks after all he became rich on short sells and almost totally broke the Bank of England
2314 2018-02-05 21:10:04 What's hilarious is how when the stocks were so high nobody gave Trump credit, and the day they drop 1000 points it's all his fault 
2315 2018-02-05 21:09:50 i do like seeing stocks plummet, i do
2316 2018-02-05 21:09:45 Lookin good! #stocks
2317 2018-02-05 21:09:44 The companies that just got a massive trillian dollar tax cut have the money, but the little people who got $1.50 extra a week from the Tax Scam and are watching their stocks plummet are aghast at the Trump economy.
2318 2018-02-05 21:09:43 What happened to my retirement today? Stocks seem sharply down, of course, you don’t give a shit. #truthinpolitics
2319 2018-02-05 21:09:42 @Cernovich uranium and uranium stocks are going to be like getting into bitcoin in the early stages
2320 2018-02-05 21:09:37 why did he crash the stocks
2321 2018-02-05 21:09:37 What stocks would one invest in now if one were to invest in stocks now?
2322 2018-02-05 21:09:35 Agree mostly. There are some good reasons for preventing tied houses (as we do with booze) but if an LP owns a retail store (which it can) and stocks competitors products why shouldn't they be able to also stock their own?
2323 2018-02-05 21:09:34 Sure there is, for young Americans, whose elders have recently heaped a bunch of new debt on their backs, can buy stocks at prices cheaper than last Thursday. They should want it to go down much further while they're in accumulation mode.
2324 2018-02-05 21:09:33 Stocks plummeting. Everyone selling to pay the bookie from last night.
2325 2018-02-05 21:09:31 This is good news for everyone who doesn't own a lot of stocks. Wages are going up, bond yields are going up, and we'll finally get a bit of inflation so there won't be as much hoarding of capital.
2326 2018-02-05 21:09:31 Yo Donnie @potus @realDonaldTrump According to you, you caused my stocks FALL BIGLY!  Loser. Sad. #MAGA
2327 2018-02-05 21:09:30 #stocks are all over the place today. #Fed worries or test-run for economic warfare?
2328 2018-02-05 21:09:30 He will either blame obama, or blame democrats for not allowing him to make the changes necessary to keep stocks high. Won’t be specific. 

He’s actually quite predictable
2329 2018-02-05 21:09:29 Meanwhile, my stocks are predicted to plummet.
2330 2018-02-05 21:09:29 y'all do know it's not just "rich people" who own stocks right like some of us got what we have from busting our asses at retail jobs and trying to plan for the future?
2331 2018-02-05 21:09:29 because stocks always have their largest point drop in history during 'bull markets'
2332 2018-02-05 21:09:28 Well so it seems like the stock market is gonna crash again & America is fucked, so I’m cashing out all my stocks 
2333 2018-02-05 21:09:27 @peaceandjoy101 butter watch it people don't lose all your retirement money by hanging on to your stocks because somebody told ya to cause if belly up they win you lose it all think what ya want to happen personally if ya do lose it all its better to take a little lose insteadall
2334 2018-02-05 21:09:27 His job is selling conspiracies.

A lot of people have no clue how the stock market works. They think stocks ARE the economy.

2336 2018-02-05 21:09:25 Earnings started to grow and stocks became more bullish with the tax cuts, but it was way ahead of itself as well. This action looks like an extreme version of 2006, which rallied aggressively right away in 2006 and then gave them all back to spend months in a rising range. $SPX
2337 2018-02-05 21:09:16 Wait so if @POTUS took credit for the stocks being high does that mean that he’s gonna take credit for the mess that’s going on right now?
2338 2018-02-05 21:09:13 How about those stocks Donnie J?

2341 2018-02-05 21:09:02 Very sad day to hold stocks 
2342 2018-02-05 21:08:53 But our stocks?
2343 2018-02-05 21:08:52 45 name calls our Representatives. He lies about his tax scam. That scam is already putting us deeper in debt than anticipated. Stocks plummet. Highest intra Day tumble. Coincidence. I think not .
2344 2018-02-05 21:08:52 Reporter “friend”:  Writing an article about Trump and the DOW.  How much did you lose?  Me:  A lot.  You?  Reporter friend: None. I don’t invest because stocks are capitalist tricks and currency is a lie.  Me: Bolshevik says what? Reporter friend: What?
2345 2018-02-05 21:08:50 but I put everything into stocks!
2346 2018-02-05 21:08:50 (extremely start-up ceo voice) I don't invest in stocks, i invest in ideas
2347 2018-02-05 21:08:49 I’m not checking stocks or crypto for a while. Maybe all week.
2348 2018-02-05 21:08:46 I lost all my stocks in 08 and haven't been back for this reason. Pop goes the bubble.
2349 2018-02-05 21:08:40 And stocks are roaring..... lol
2350 2018-02-05 21:08:38 Stocks are going on sale! (also this is not a "crash")

2352 2018-02-05 21:08:31 the stocks are tanking because tom brady lost the super bowl
2353 2018-02-05 21:08:28 I still have stocks I wanna buy. They haven't sold off enough yet! Believe it or not.
2354 2018-02-05 21:08:25 U.S. stocks plunged the most since 2011, with the Dow sinking more than 1,100 points as the equity selloff reached a fever pitch. -- Bloomberg
2355 2018-02-05 21:08:24 It will bounce back up. Fed raised rates on Friday. People pull out of stocks to put money into bonds, lowering stock prices, new investors will buy into stocks that were previously too high, causing it to rise. People who champion increased wages should be happy.This is showing
2356 2018-02-05 21:08:23 But... Friday the stocks crashed 666 points. They opened with a drop of 300 within a minute! They're crashing 1500 and there's still an hour to go. 

You're bankrupting America worse than the six bankruptcies of your own businesses using other people's money.
2357 2018-02-05 21:08:21 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are down!!! All you Donnie.
2358 2018-02-05 21:08:20 @realDonaldTrump In 2 days stocks lost more than they gained in the last year. What do you have to say now?
2359 2018-02-05 21:08:17 Wonders who @realDonaldTrump will blame for the stock market's record losses today. I mean, if he takes credit for when it does well I'm sure he'll take the blame when it does bad, right? 

Dow Jones #Dow #StockMarket
#ThingsNotFoundInMyHome = stocks
2360 2018-02-05 21:08:16 It could be a great opportunity to pick up some quality stocks at hefty discounts as the market slides off a cliff in the US. Don't know when though..
2361 2018-02-05 21:08:12 Poor Gary. Stocks down over 1100 points. Biggest fall in history. Saving what??? #DowJones #MuellerIsComing
2362 2018-02-05 21:08:11 Frankly if you ask me it's treasonous for stocks to go down when the president speaks.

2367 2018-02-05 21:08:07 You're really arguing with yourself, as I'm just a guy who writes about stocks. Feel free to disregard my blog. My personal holdings in indexes have dropped into the toilet today (though the chain hasn't been pulled, unlike $OSTK). So please leave me be while I weep softly.
2368 2018-02-05 21:08:06 Hey, Grover: Did you buy any stocks or mutual at the beginning of the Obama administration? Mine did really, really well. Like 400% increase on my BofA from the time I bought till the time Obama left. Thanks, Obama!
2369 2018-02-05 21:08:01 Last week Jim Cramer commented, don't be a pig.  If you feel like you made a good profit on some stocks, take your profit. So glad I listened to him.

2371 2018-02-05 21:07:53 Thank you, JIM. Between your AAP club bulletins and on-air advice, was able to make some nice selective buys. Looking forward to tomorrow’s “sale” on stocks!
2372 2018-02-05 21:07:49 How is that weird? For many their 401k IS their monthly income. If the stocks they're vested in decline, so does their money.
2373 2018-02-05 21:07:48 He continuously tweets that he’s the best thing ever when stocks are up, betting we don’t hear him saying a damn thing today. You want the credit you get the blame.
2374 2018-02-05 21:07:46 Better for the net buyer of stocks!

2376 2018-02-05 21:07:37 So I'm investing in the stocks for the first time and they seem to be getting cheaper and cheaper, which is good, right?
2377 2018-02-05 21:07:35 TBD... still see this move in stocks as corrective, Bear Stearns like. Main event later this summer, the true Lehman moment, but we'll know soon enough.
2378 2018-02-05 21:07:35 And most of my stocks went up today.  good times!!
2379 2018-02-05 21:07:31 NEW...

2384 2018-02-05 21:07:21 Jokes on you I don't have any stocks lmao
2385 2018-02-05 21:07:14 If you're a wealthy investor with a lot of money in stocks or about to retire on your stock-based IRA/401K, yes. Otherwise, not until it drops far enough to lead to businesses shuttering & loss of real jobs (not stockbrokers/analysts).
2386 2018-02-05 21:07:14 An expected normal correction.  Fundamentals sound, economy doing quite well.  Time to buy stocks.
2387 2018-02-05 21:07:12 The damn stocks are dying? Heh!
2388 2018-02-05 21:07:10 ironically this all started on good Friday economic news with nfp release. bond yields surged on the good news, but stocks crash when investors chase yields instead. was the good economy that did this, go figure
2389 2018-02-05 21:07:08 my stocks plummeted today 
2390 2018-02-05 21:07:05 @realDonaldTrump "Stocks tumble again: Dow closes down 1,176 points after biggest intraday points loss in history" - #isamericagreatyet
2391 2018-02-05 21:07:04 I laugh as the stocks tumble, too poor to ever think of investing money
2392 2018-02-05 21:07:03 #StockMarket Ever since @POTUS release memo stocks have dropped going back to pre-election data. Memo the  reason fall in stocks. @CNBC @CNN @FoxNews @WSJbusiness @MSNBC
2393 2018-02-05 21:07:01 Good thing I already too poor to own stocks.
2394 2018-02-05 21:07:00 @SgtFundtime Interesting day on the Street today. Evenso, some stocks still rose.
2395 2018-02-05 21:07:00 And our stocks are now going down. Fun times.
2396 2018-02-05 21:06:55 The stocks are reacting to instability. We will hear the real news soon. Big family is selling their assets after eo put in place. More memos create more instability. Arrests.
2397 2018-02-05 21:06:54 Fatcat billionaires love cheap stocks
2398 2018-02-05 21:06:54 The liberal media is going to spin the stock market correction today. Think about it. The stocks are around 24,000 and they only lost 4% the economy is robust with tax cuts and more Americans working. The media wants a total meltdown of the stocks and economy not happening
2399 2018-02-05 21:06:52 What is going on with the stocks today!!??
2400 2018-02-05 21:06:52 Or maybe he’s being all philosophical & telling us this is how the Dow Jones is. We should focus on how it is right now. Not back when our stocks had value or the future when they will be worthless.
2401 2018-02-05 21:06:48 My pay didn't change but I lost a couple hundred in stocks today. Thanks for the hard work bro
2402 2018-02-05 21:06:47 Stock Market had another HUGE crash today. DOW lost 1175 points! Largest daily point loss in HISTORY! A RECORD! No need to worry, insiders told me that a crash was coming, so I sold off all my stocks last Thursday. SMART! #MondayMotivation
2403 2018-02-05 21:06:46 @realDonaldTrump to take full responsibility for the dramatic fall in stock prices. Claims all stocks on sale 50% off. Your welcome America. #MAGA
2404 2018-02-05 21:06:45 Anyone else find it hilarious that the people who used the comeback "You cant hate Trump 2 much when you look at your stocks" are the same ones now coming back screaming "the president has nothing to do with the stock market!" Pathetic, guys...pathetic. He's rubbing off on you...
2405 2018-02-05 21:06:39 Setting records all over the place!  Polar ice caps! Tax cuts! Stocks!...

2408 2018-02-05 21:06:24 Dear @POTUS @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @FHFA ... It's the prefect time to exercise the warrants and reprivatize the #GSEs as dividend-yield utility stocks... Equity investors need more stable and long-term dividend options. Remember #GrannyStocks of old?
2409 2018-02-05 21:06:21 No, snowflake. It's just a good time to buy, when the price of stocks are cheaper. This correction has to happen.
2410 2018-02-05 21:06:21 Yknow people are saying the stocks are so much bigger now, and you'll be surprised, it'll be phenomenal, and we've got the best people, everyone'll thank me, we've do so much, it's very, very solid and this why they keep saying there was no collusion, everyone knows this!
2411 2018-02-05 21:06:21 #BlackMonday Part 2! #DowJones stocks down about 1,000 points. It's all your fault @POTUS aka #DonaldTrump! SMH! #WeAreNotThis! #ResignTrump #ResignNow #SaveTheCountry #WeDontWantAnotherRecession #NoRecession #StockMarketCrash #BlackMonday2
2412 2018-02-05 21:06:20 So let's get this straight... I buy a few fake stocks in Grand Theft Auto V last night, and the Dow Jones immediately plummets? #MyBadGuys
2413 2018-02-05 21:06:19 Well, the Dow did settle down at 1,175.28 
Hold your positions for now and buy good cheaper stocks.
2414 2018-02-05 21:06:17 So I own some Fitbit stocks, if the the market is down, does that make my Fitbit stocks price go down. Too??
2415 2018-02-05 21:06:14 hey so who else is looking at their stocks and panicking just a little bit 
2416 2018-02-05 21:06:10 Are the US tax cuts good for corporations now?  Stocks trickling down for sure
2417 2018-02-05 21:06:06 @realDonaldTrump stocks are tanking  bud. You ready to blame Obama? #maga #donaldtrump #obama #america #eagle #stocks #dow

2420 2018-02-05 21:06:02 BREAKING: Dow plunges more than 1,100 points in wild trading session, S&P 500 goes negative for 2018 #stocks #Stockmarket #dowjones
2421 2018-02-05 21:06:00 You know what's always there whether stocks are up or falling hard? Poems.
2422 2018-02-05 21:05:53 You know nothing about stocks.. this is a correction...interest rates went up and it means economy is doing good...
2423 2018-02-05 21:05:51 The stock market is dropping?
Why is this a big deal, I mean, these markets are volatile and it’s February, this is common, look up the January Effect, which is when stocks boom from higher sales volume then level off afterwards.
2424 2018-02-05 21:05:50 Think positive, Folks... I see a REBOUND coming for the Stock Market... #Stocks #DowJones #NASDAQ #StandardAndPoors500
2425 2018-02-05 21:05:47 May your stocks at least pay dividends.
2426 2018-02-05 21:05:43 @realDonaldTrump ...
Whatcha got to say about them stocks today?  Take your time.  Think up something witty!
2427 2018-02-05 21:05:39 The last US job report spooked the market - fastest wage growth in 8 yrs, means the Fed will be in a rate tightening cycle. Funds naturally sold stocks and bought bonds at cheap rates ahead of this.
2428 2018-02-05 21:05:36 When stocks are going down, you want to listen to bond guys, not stock guys.

2432 2018-02-05 21:05:24 My stocks were going so well lol
2433 2018-02-05 21:05:23 Then why are stocks selling, selling, selling?  You are a great financial advisor. Time to take advantage of some of your clients?  You be the master.
2434 2018-02-05 21:05:19 In other words, stocks are on sale. Time to buy.
2435 2018-02-05 21:05:17 At least now it is now apparent to everybody that #US #equities climaxed, which means global equities climaxed!!! so take care of your portfolios_ stay away from momentum trades & high beta stocks
2436 2018-02-05 21:05:17 Stocks moving to reflect economic and policy reality.  It's about time the sugar hit was assessed for what it was.
2437 2018-02-05 21:05:13 Looks like stocks are on sale
2438 2018-02-05 21:05:12 That’s what makes me so nervous about it. I guess when you don’t have extra thousands laying around, investing in stocks to possibly see it go poof, is scary!
2439 2018-02-05 21:05:09 As the stocks continued to drop before our eyes. I hope people wake up and take the blinders off.

Stocks were crushed Monday. The Dow fell more than 1,100 points, biggest point drop ever, according to preliminary totals.
2445 2018-02-05 21:04:58 Those of us who don't have stocks, bonds, or 401ks, who keep tiny cash stashes in dresser drawers, are happier than investors. #Dow
2446 2018-02-05 21:04:57 Stocks are DOWn with the sickness and some economists are feeling more than a little Disturbed!

2447 2018-02-05 21:04:57 Under Trump, stocks JUMP 40%.

Today, stocks slip 4%
2448 2018-02-05 21:04:56 Trump was doing good. Thinks its the memo. Trust confidense is a big part of stocks.I guess this is what the democrats wanted.
2449 2018-02-05 21:04:55 Which is more profitable?
Stocks or Forex?
2450 2018-02-05 21:04:52 All 40 stocks I watch are in the Red today double % point loss.

2453 2018-02-05 21:04:48 Stocks dropped 1100 points erasing all of the gains made in 2018. Care to comment about that? ,,,,,,,,, Yeah, I didn’t think so.....
2454 2018-02-05 21:04:47 Dow down 1100 points!! Almost 1800 points in 2 days. 2300 points in a week. BIGGEST SINGLE DAY LOSS EVER by more than 50%. It’s yuuge!! Thanks Dotard! You want all the credit for the stocks, well here you go!
2455 2018-02-05 21:04:47 Someone tell me what's happening in the stock market. Should I sell all my stocks? 
2456 2018-02-05 21:04:43 Time to buy now that stocks are down!
2457 2018-02-05 21:04:42 Hey, why did you let my stocks loose so much value today??? WTF is wrong with you ?
2458 2018-02-05 21:04:39 That is the first time in a few years I've had the stocks open on my screen for more than 20 minutes.
2459 2018-02-05 21:04:38 Wages are going up, which means companies are paying more.  US is borrowing so much more this year, which means debt will rise, as well as interest on it.  Could these be what the market is reacting to? #StockMarket #market #stocks #Investors #bonds
2460 2018-02-05 21:04:38 Because anything that makes his Anti Trump narrative is crucial for George. And he doesn’t know a damn thing about stocks.
2461 2018-02-05 21:04:32 Stocks are going down (doobie do down down) but I'm unemployed so I don't have any stocks. #ThanksTrump
2462 2018-02-05 21:04:31 It looks like they finally got all the
moms and pops to dive into stocks.
2463 2018-02-05 21:04:29 As our retirement stocks tank and the deficit rises.
2464 2018-02-05 21:04:28 All stocks and crypto took a beating today.. Sheesh.. Trump we need a press conference to pump them pupies back up
2465 2018-02-05 21:04:28 I question anyone who says something off-beat, doesn't matter how much experience in the field you have, even Warren Buffet can be wrong on stocks.
2466 2018-02-05 21:04:23 Mine does. Directly invested in multiple bonds made up of bundles of stocks essentially. When those stocks collectively do poorly, the bond does poorly. It’s a slow effect that isn’t always 1:1 but I’m down ~1.5% today.
2467 2018-02-05 21:04:17 My stocks took a hit today. 
2468 2018-02-05 21:04:17 Rotation out of stocks into crypto.
2469 2018-02-05 21:04:14 Calm yourselves, folks. It's a large correction to compensate for the massive gains the market was making. We all knew it was going to happen. If you're in a bind, flock to precious metals and bonds for safety. All the stocks are going into correction territory.
2470 2018-02-05 21:04:10 @potus Trump is in charge of the largest drop of stocks in history. Trump is finally #1. Biggest loser ever
2471 2018-02-05 21:04:06 @farrisbaba I have some #baba stocks at $204, today is $180, do I have to sell, stand or buy some more...?
2472 2018-02-05 21:04:04 Anyone who places savings in a pension fund or really any money market fund is doing so. Most stocks are held by pension funds
2473 2018-02-05 21:04:00 The market is taking a breather, this is a good thing! Stocks are the only thing that people get mad when they go on sale.
2474 2018-02-05 21:04:00 Better get Trump’s agenda enacted or stocks will continue to fall as hope fades.  Get going, Congress.
2475 2018-02-05 21:03:56 Ouch, my stocks.. again
2476 2018-02-05 21:03:50 Political uncertainty. Dow plunges. Voters gave #Trump too much glory over #Stocks Is he going to take credit for the market weakening? #StockMarketCrash

2480 2018-02-05 21:03:41 US stocks into free fall! Worst fall in % terms since 2011! Will you take credit for this? Or is it Hilary’s & Obama’s fault. I’m sure @foxandfriends will find a way to blame them.

2482 2018-02-05 21:03:37 I always like to think of it as the stocks going "on sale" buy them for less than they were yesterday (but maybe more than they're worth tomorrow)
2483 2018-02-05 21:03:33 Guy on Bloomberg right now is a strategist but totally panicking. You can tell because he's very strident about how stocks can't go down when the economy is doing well. Which is utterly false since stocks usually lead the economy. Last high was in 2007, not 2008.

2487 2018-02-05 21:03:28 Stock Market Twitter is spurring some WILD flashbacks to the 08 crash during sophomore year of HS when i had no idea what stocks "were" per se but DID have extreme anxiety so each afternoon in study hall i would sneak my phone out & check the stocks app & make myself terrified!!!
2488 2018-02-05 21:03:23 The stock market DROP IS GOOD b/c now many more individuals will be able to buy stocks. Many were not buying at those ridiculously high prices of 26,000+

2496 2018-02-05 21:03:02 And stocks have been way overvalued wrt earnings for a very long time. Investors during the bull market have not been long term investors looking to make a return from the operations of the company. They've bought in order to make a capital gain. It's been purely spevulative
2497 2018-02-05 21:02:58 Ever since the Nunes memo, stocks are dropping for all American workers with a 401K plan.
2498 2018-02-05 21:02:51 @ABC A "special report" on the stock market. Did you do this for Obama? Just trying to make @POTUS look bad? Seriously, stocks go up and down--it's NOT a "special report." #Joke #FakeNews #ABCNews
2499 2018-02-05 21:02:48 Stocks bounce back ? I'm not sure what stocks your talking about but every single stock that I have is down. And I'm not on about a small percentage. No bounce at all. More like bowling ball hitting floor

2504 2018-02-05 21:02:41 Because of @realDonaldTrump the Stock Market has taken it's

2506 2018-02-05 21:02:36 A day like today on the stock market should be a reminder that you need to diversify your stocks. If you put all your eggs in one basket and that basket breaks you are up a creek without a paddle. It’s all about diversifying.

2514 2018-02-05 21:02:30 Via @AP: The Dow Jones industrial average briefly plunged nearly 1,600 points Monday as two days of steep losses for US stocks ended a period of record-setting calm in the market. The Dow recouped about half that loss within minutes, but its gains for the year were still gone.
2515 2018-02-05 21:02:26 Lol the stocks are crashing

That's another thing I'm curious about - people putting too much stock (no pun intended) into Dow levels

2527 2018-02-05 21:02:08 And those big corporations and their CEO's are ready to spend those big dollars congress sent their way. Now they can buy each others stocks really low and then it will inevitably go up and lo and behold a profit. I would look for manipulation. Trump era machinations.
2528 2018-02-05 21:02:07 Welp, looks like they finally got all
the moms and pops to dive into stocks.
2529 2018-02-05 21:02:06 Take your money out the stocks or buy low
2530 2018-02-05 21:02:05 Dow closes down by nearly 1,200. #Dow #Stocks #Investing #WallStreet
2531 2018-02-05 21:01:59 Stocks going WAY DOWN. Companies SHUTTING DOWN. Layoffs going WAY UP. And #ItsMuellerTime , so Trump regime -aka #shitholepresident is GOING TO JAIL!!
2532 2018-02-05 21:01:56 Days like today make me so humble and thankful I trade Penny Stocks and Options! The Algo’s Control Big boards.  I hope many didn’t lose their ass today.. Stay Level Headed.   Have Fun!!    Go DFCO!!
2533 2018-02-05 21:01:51 This will not help me, because Facebook has denied me access to my account, because they want me to buy an i-Phone, and use an official government ID. They know it's me, but I'm too liberal. I said the stocks would tumble due to Trump.
2534 2018-02-05 21:01:48 It's the best time to buy stocks with this dip.
2535 2018-02-05 21:01:43 I trade stocks, why am I losing money? I thought trump was doing such a great job?
2536 2018-02-05 21:01:38 Yo @realDonaldTrump whats going on with that stock market? RECORD BREAKING falls. You stay breaking records huh?! Lolol. This a part of your strategy? Remember tho... the stocks ARE NOT THE ECONOMY.
2537 2018-02-05 21:01:37 Having a really hard time caring today because I'm just so exhausted by everything. Phone fell on the floor? Oh well. Behind on assignments in a class? I guess I'll try to talk to my teacher tonight. Stocks plunging? *Shrug*.
2538 2018-02-05 21:01:34 I’m in the middle of this documentary on Marxist philosophy & my mom seriously texted me right now telling me to buy up stocks
2539 2018-02-05 21:01:28 guess the companies that were dumping that tax break into their own stocks are gonna have to move a bit quicker with the cash... I hope they go broke saving themselves.
2540 2018-02-05 21:01:26 Wow, stocks are doing great, huh? Totally your responsibility. Be a man for once
2541 2018-02-05 21:01:26 Thank GOD this day is over. Stocks down 1174 pts. 4.61% drop. #Dow
2542 2018-02-05 21:01:24 So quick to brag about stocks going up...going down again today. If you want to own the up - you'd better own the down. #liar #fool #upanddown Tweet away twitter fingers. #ownit
2543 2018-02-05 21:01:22 Trump is deliberately tone deaf when tragedy happens bc he’s a fucking coward and doesn’t have the words 

#stocks
#TheDow 

But this seems intentional 

This feels like an attack
2544 2018-02-05 21:01:21 *Largest intraday point drop in #Dow history! Thanks Dump #Trump #Stocks #StockMarket
2545 2018-02-05 21:01:16 Lot of people monitoring DJ stocks, will invest in crypto #cripto #DowJones #ripple #nasdaq #tron #bitcoin
2546 2018-02-05 21:01:12 oh yeah talking about the type of stocks it contains, it's all american.  it's literally an average of 30 industrial stocks from some of our biggest companies.
2547 2018-02-05 21:01:12 Worst day for the S&P 500 since August 2011..S&P 500 Health stocks much of the same and the YTD gains have officially been wiped from the books for now
2548 2018-02-05 21:01:04 Candidate Trump said stock market is scam and he never invests in stocks.  Which is it?
2549 2018-02-05 21:01:04 I hate that you are right.

I mean, it's a little sad that we can predict their lies and know that their base is gonna eat it up.

Trump also "Dem obstruction and fake Russia probe is why stocks are falling. They didn't clap"
2550 2018-02-05 21:01:00 It all makes sense now. The Patriots-NFL Conspiracy wasn’t with Goodell but with the sponsors. Now those sponsor stocks are crashing cuz the Pats lost #math #facts
2551 2018-02-05 21:00:55 Congratulations on the BIGGEST day in the history of the Dow Jones index. You are the best at stocks. Big League   #MAGA
2552 2018-02-05 21:00:55 Stocks down 1000.  Paychecks up $1.50 ????
2553 2018-02-05 21:00:54 People dumping stocks to buy the bitcoin dip?
2554 2018-02-05 21:00:53 STOCKS going WAY DOWN #LazyBustardTrump. All 2018 gains wiped out completely. Now it's on you #RussianPuppet

2556 2018-02-05 21:00:37 Percent of Stocks Above 200-Day Average INDEX: 66.11
2557 2018-02-05 21:00:31 And their stocks are going down
2558 2018-02-05 21:00:31 M&S stocks bounced back up once Scott got that under better control.
2559 2018-02-05 21:00:30 *resists checking his 401k and stocks until later this evening, preferably after the #HSI opens, or at least till futures trading begins*
2560 2018-02-05 21:00:28 stocks fall
2561 2018-02-05 21:00:21 Anyone else seeing how stocks and bitcoin are starting to move together? Not sure what that means
2562 2018-02-05 21:00:21  What goes up, must come down... #dow #stocks
@realdonaldtrump - you’re gonna claim credit for this too right?! #lol
2563 2018-02-05 21:00:21 Rothschild trying to tank the market again so they can buy it on the low low ya'll. It's like de ja vu all over again. Except London now it's New York #shenanigans #waterloo #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #wallstreet #stocks
2564 2018-02-05 21:00:18 Stocks taking a beating. You're taking fault I assume?
2565 2018-02-05 21:00:18 Stocks are tumbling you take credit for this to? Just like you did the increases?
2566 2018-02-05 21:00:16 quick find some cash to buy some basement priced stocks? or do we just fret?
2567 2018-02-05 21:00:15 Can someone get my dad out my doorway talking bout some damn stocks while I’m tryna do my makeup
2568 2018-02-05 21:00:15 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @FoxBusiness @FoxNewsOpinion @LizClaman SOBs! YOU IDIOTS BREAK AWAY/@POTUS 4/SWING IN STOCKS!
2569 2018-02-05 21:00:14 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS   and if you don’t think firing the DOW JONES with one of your cronies to rig and falsify stocks n earnings looks suspicious think again!!!
2570 2018-02-05 21:00:14 Why stocks plunged last week.
2571 2018-02-05 21:00:14 The Eagles win the Super Bowl and then stocks crash. You see, this is why we needed Tom Brady to win yesterday.
2572 2018-02-05 21:00:08 Anyone got any stock tips for stocks that cost about $1.50?
#DowJones
2573 2018-02-05 21:00:07 You want the credit when stocks are up Donny...you get the credit when the stocks take a TRUMP DUMP!!!
2574 2018-02-05 21:00:03 If only he were as strict on stocks as he is on aviation.
2575 2018-02-05 21:00:03 Obama isn't the president, moron 
Let's talk about stocks
2576 2018-02-05 21:00:01 i guess stocks in o and g must be ok cuz #Gaslighting is big in the #GOP
2577 2018-02-05 20:59:58 The VIX, or the fear factor in Stocks, rises to 30.49 from 9 on January 5. The higher the number, the more fear in the equity markets.
2578 2018-02-05 20:59:55 Quickly move your stocks into Bonds And Mortgages

People are selling on the Dow Jones … They are selling high… They Will buy  later when it’s low. I’m going to sell NOW.  Moving out of the market for a while
2579 2018-02-05 20:59:51 And the countries debt is going WAY UP and the stocks are crashing. Thanks for nothing.
2580 2018-02-05 20:59:50 Initiated $appl today at 156 ..
2581 2018-02-05 20:59:43 Obama appointee Chairman of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen's last day was Friday. On her last day she slapped NEW sanctions on Wells Fargo, plunging stocks more than 2% on her way out. Intentional? #MAGA
2582 2018-02-05 20:59:40 You have claimed how great the economy is based on stocks alone but this isn’t great! #dowcrash
2583 2018-02-05 20:59:39 We're relying on you to keep fighting the good fight. Maybe stocks tanking will finally get through to the republicans that the freaking pie isn't worth working with this admin.
2584 2018-02-05 20:59:39 Stocks aren't investments in productive capital. Nowadays they're just a way to make short term speculative gains, it's really just a placement of savings
2585 2018-02-05 20:59:36 At midday, MBS flat. Stocks lower, Dow -300 points. 10-yr yield 2.83%.
2586 2018-02-05 20:59:34 Bond market is the key. Sell-off in treasuries means higher rates & direct competition for stocks. Coupled with the Fed raising rates while simulatneously unwinding their balance sheet feels like bad news for stocks. Either way the market needs to consolidate recent gains.
2587 2018-02-05 20:59:34 Dear @realDonaldTrump,

Whatever gets you high will always bring you down. 

Don't mention the stocks. Ever.
2588 2018-02-05 20:59:33 lost a healthy amt of money in stocks today but as soon as it rebounds over the next few days/weeks or w/e I'm selling that shit lol
2589 2018-02-05 20:59:33 When just about EVERYTHING is on the red list, are there any good tools out there to figure out which are broken stocks versus those that are just hanging with the wrong crowd? @MadMoneyOnCNBC #MadTweets
2590 2018-02-05 20:59:28 @realDonaldTrump stocks are dropping like Trump businesses
2591 2018-02-05 20:59:21 Stocks go up, and down?! Keep us informed on these unusual developments!
2592 2018-02-05 20:59:19 The #skyisfalling , sky is falling, I need a drink . Hmmmm   time to buy beer and alcohol stocks!?  #Market #beer #whiskey #economy #Soros ??
2593 2018-02-05 20:59:18 @RobertBryan4 Yikes "stocks slide as Trump takes oath" Then goes up 6,000 points. 
Oops.
2594 2018-02-05 20:59:15 The economy is solid - stocks were just overvalued.
2595 2018-02-05 20:59:14 what a BIG SURPRISE ... after the wall street banks SUCKER the small investor to put the last $50 they have into overprices stocks ... THEN they take their money out & leave the SUCKERS holding the bags ... everything that goes up MUST COME DOWN ... it's physics ... google it
2596 2018-02-05 20:59:09 Stocks drop over 1,000 points since Trump/Nunes memo, showing a weakness in protecting America. This drop only effects the American WIRKER her 410 k plan and retirement and loan plans, so not hurting the rich ONLY REAL AMERICANS!!
2597 2018-02-05 20:58:53 Thank you so much!  Keep fighting for us!!!  Your the first president that I ever saw results for we the middle class.     I have been wondering why the stocks are dropping off at this time...I sure hope they start going back up soon!   Help!
2598 2018-02-05 20:58:50 stocks are taking a big hit.  Thanks to you.  Why dont you shine some light on some of your blunders and stay off of twitter.  Like I have told many of your followers.  Your math is horrible and the beginning of dropping stocks is on its way.
2599 2018-02-05 20:58:49 If you're selling stocks, your just losing future money to the rich 1% who are taking profits from those who got into it late, as well as trying to ruin market success for @potus and #GOP success, market started falling day after State of Union.
2600 2018-02-05 20:58:47 The stocks are down & since you take credit when they’re up this is your fault now. @realDonaldTrump you’re ruining the economy you fat toad
2601 2018-02-05 20:58:45 Plummeting stocks are the new run on the bank.
2602 2018-02-05 20:58:45 not for the spx 500. there are only 500 stocks there :)
2603 2018-02-05 20:58:38 perhaps they should do the same for stocks? #dowdrop
2604 2018-02-05 20:58:31 Spoken like a true ignoramus who knows NOTHING about the stocks. Apparently King thinks the stocks should just go straight up. If you were smart you would take all that money you brag about having and invest it now while its a good buying opportunity
2605 2018-02-05 20:58:29 STOCK MKT. OPINION 

Yes stocks are getting hammered. Economic fundamentals still strong. Would not shock me if GLOBALIST are behind effort to wreck economy to help bring Trump down. 

1st must arrest those involved in govt. overthrow attempt going on now & prosecute the traitors
2606 2018-02-05 20:58:27 EVERYBODY's taking notes these days. Ever since Comey. Might be a good time to throw some coin at Mead and Bic stocks.
2607 2018-02-05 20:58:25 Stocks are bitcoin for people who are good at cocaine
2608 2018-02-05 20:58:23 Thanks good friend about the stocks worldwide xxx
2609 2018-02-05 20:58:20 Happy to announce my stocks are absolutely fisting my ass right about now 
2610 2018-02-05 20:58:17 Hearing rumor that yells of "trade them all!" at Boston based hedge funds were NOT about the stocks.
2611 2018-02-05 20:58:11 The average of 30 major (more important) stocks
2612 2018-02-05 20:58:10 Horrible, stocks are down, crypto is down :(
2613 2018-02-05 20:58:09 I was looking at the replies to Bill Mitchell blaming Obama for the stocks today, people actually believe that.
2614 2018-02-05 20:58:07 The stock market DROP IS GOOD b/c now many more individuals will be able to buy stocks. Many were not buying at those ridiculously high prices of 26,000+
2615 2018-02-05 20:58:04 In melee there is a mechanic that makes it easier to mash out of grabs if you are behind in stocks
2616 2018-02-05 20:57:59 What’s going on with US stock Market and with crypto plunge #usstock #BTC #stocks #cryptocurreny #Cryptopia
2617 2018-02-05 20:57:58 So i am allowed to buy #stocks and socks with my credit card, book flights, gamble in casinos and buy #currencies from #junkcountries. But these #Banksters do not allow to buy #bitcoin and #Cryptocurrency ? F**k you! it's my #money, my decision and your #fear! $btc $xvg #Verge
2618 2018-02-05 20:57:57 Cities, States Ban Bump Stocks After Push Stalls In Congress
2619 2018-02-05 20:57:57 A Swedish January is dark, cold and snowy, but in Stockholm cannabis stocks were lighting up the screens of investors.

"Out of nowhere, the interest for Canadian cannabis shares has completely exploded in Sweden," said Joakim Bornold, a savings adviser.
2620 2018-02-05 20:57:56 You can do an account transfer with just the stocks/mutual funds in it. Think of like keeping the same car just moving it to a new garage. Look at your load charges and 12B-1 fees. Over a lifetime those fees can cost you tens of thousands
2621 2018-02-05 20:57:51 There was no cookies at 7:40am. Stocks must've been low to start 
2622 2018-02-05 20:57:50 Take the money and run, said all the rich. People are selling stocks like crazy. Guess what they will buy with all that money?
2623 2018-02-05 20:57:45 Will start to buy more stocks now that market heading down. I will also reduce all my buys into smaller sizes so I can continue to average down as my holdings dive with the market
2624 2018-02-05 20:57:44 Bro!!! I completely understand. I’m hurting just like you......But still go buy some more stocks even if it’s against them student loans lol. Them profits gonna be crazy nice
2625 2018-02-05 20:57:41 Can you make the stocks do a good thing again please and thank you sir
2626 2018-02-05 20:57:31 My guess is everyone tweeting Dow Jones ‘crashing’ has no idea how stock market works or even have stocks.
2627 2018-02-05 20:57:24 Which Dow stocks should people buy with their extra $1.50? @SpeakerRyan
2628 2018-02-05 20:57:22 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Hey trump, funny how you love the DOW when stocks were going up now they fall and instead of taking the blame, like a mature adult , let’s pretend. This is happening After your tax cut.  When good oh it’s because of you when it drops it is their fault?!?!
2629 2018-02-05 20:57:14 of course bounce on friday was also promising on $BTC but turn out to be not THE DIP but a dip! So being careful is a good virtue at this moment. $BTCUSD
2630 2018-02-05 20:57:13 .You're young; it will heal! If this kind of normal-downturn bruising hurts TOO much -- well, stocks may not be the market to be in!
2631 2018-02-05 20:57:08 The top 20% of Americans own 80% of all stocks. 50% of Americans have zero investment in the market. So the Dow drop doesn't even affect most people #TheDow
2632 2018-02-05 20:57:06 You can tell you're a certain age if a 4% decline in stocks doesn't even get your heart beating fast.
2633 2018-02-05 20:57:00 Queue mainstream media covering stocks...now
2634 2018-02-05 20:56:59 oh my! I don’t listen to fake news but but I’m not surprised if they encouraged people to sell their stocks……………………  #FakeNews encouraged people to sell your stocks, i’m not surprised
2635 2018-02-05 20:56:54 Are you going to credit for the stocks dropping @realDonaldTrump?
2636 2018-02-05 20:56:54 This is exactly what the @GOP and 45 wanted..Stocks drop to nothing..Corporations buy stock at pennies on the dollar. Gov't will shut down..when it comes back Market stabilizes, with a lot of fewer corporations. Watch...It will fall til after govt comes back
2637 2018-02-05 20:56:52 If he does, do you think he bought all his stocks only a few days ago and sold the ALL at the ending of today?
2638 2018-02-05 20:56:50 Wow you investing in stocks without me?
2639 2018-02-05 20:56:49 *me waking up this morning and warming up the computer* no... this can’t be... the stocks... theyre all wrong! *tapping keyboard frantically* no!
2640 2018-02-05 20:56:46 Hey idiot trump and @HouseGOP, great job…....stocks are crashing. This is on YOU and your fucking tax scam. You own this.
2641 2018-02-05 20:56:37 Those oldskool traders need to work more on their rule number 1.

2642 2018-02-05 20:56:32 Wages going up $1.50 per week and stocks plummets 1100plus points today?  When will you take the fall for this huge drop today and last week?
2643 2018-02-05 20:56:31 After the Dow Jones Industrial averages fell over 600 points on Friday, it continued to fall today and resulted in stocks being sold off at an unusually high rate. #2150ce
2644 2018-02-05 20:56:21 My stocks!
2645 2018-02-05 20:56:20 People aren't hyperventilating - they're just pointing out that after all the upside talk from the tax plan the downside is all of a sudden blatantly visible. When you are deeper in debt it costs more to borrow so rates up stocks down ...due to higher lending costs. ....or DUH
2646 2018-02-05 20:56:19 stocks are currently the biggest bubble in human history! Hang on to your hats people because...  it wont be long before this bubble bursts!! #TrumpStockCrash #stockbubble #crashof2018 #DUMBDONALD
2647 2018-02-05 20:56:18 How do I mine stocks
2648 2018-02-05 20:56:17 And that's one of them main rules when it comes to portfolio ownership, N E V E R fall in love with your stocks.
2649 2018-02-05 20:56:13 not 1 of the ppl behind him own stocks lol
2650 2018-02-05 20:56:06 Why did all stocks take a hit today? 
2651 2018-02-05 20:56:00 Probably because those stocks are backed by nothing.
2652 2018-02-05 20:55:59 Poor people don’t own stocks so the crash doesn’t directly affect them but the fakest tax plan in history does. $1.50 increase per week for that school secretary Paul Ryan was talking about is a disgrace 
2653 2018-02-05 20:55:58 My paychecks is hardly going up, i'm not getting much back and my taxes are forecast to raise in 4 years. OH and the stocks are tanking currently. THANKS
2654 2018-02-05 20:55:57 Market correction...bond yields are increasing so some folks are moving money from stocks to bonds lol #FunTimes
2655 2018-02-05 20:55:52 Do you suggest any major dip in Nifty and Nifty 50 stocks should be bought? Or should we wait for it to settle?
2656 2018-02-05 20:55:49 Thanks to your incompetence and reckless behavior the stocks are their worst downward plunge in decades - YOU OWN THIS
2657 2018-02-05 20:55:49 Interest rates went up, people pull money from stocks and put them in money markets and CDs. Safer investment. That’s what I would do anyway. There will be a correction at some point.
2658 2018-02-05 20:55:47 I have never before felt so fortunate to not be able to afford stocks or a 401k. The system works, people.
2659 2018-02-05 20:55:44 Stocks up record highs and “Experts” say: Buy! This market is on fire!
Stocks drop record amounts and “new experts” say: Sell! We’ve only begun to see the bloodshed coming!
Thanks. You’ve been extremely helpful.  I’ve got yesterday’s lottery numbers too.
2660 2018-02-05 20:55:43 Stocks are down and large corporations are having huge layoffs. Sounds like your plan was an epic fail.
2661 2018-02-05 20:55:42 Thanks Mr President for the stock market crash today #StockMarket #stocks
2662 2018-02-05 20:55:42 @FoxNews
Stocks Go Up Stocks Go Down. Funny how Democrats only want to talk about market when it goes down.
2663 2018-02-05 20:55:41 @petenajarian thought about $appl at this level ??
2664 2018-02-05 20:55:36 This just might be the market correction we were waiting for...

2665 2018-02-05 20:55:35 just checked my MyFreeCams tokens. yep. still valuable. Valuable and untethered. sorry investors, i'm still rich as hell. i told you crypto was bad and also stocks are bad
2666 2018-02-05 20:55:33 Algorithms trading with and against algorithms. Profit taking, some. Correction for those "ether" stocks, some.
2667 2018-02-05 20:55:31 "Reportedly, Trump is mulling replacing the Dow with a new system, in which Sarah Huckabee Sanders would appear every day at 4 P.M. to announce how high stocks had skyrocketed."
2668 2018-02-05 20:55:25 Bitcoin isn’t the only one and a lot of people are gambling with smaller valued (think penny stocks) currency options. Personally, I feel they are more scary than Bitcoin.
2669 2018-02-05 20:55:19 Bubble, bubble toil and TROUBLE

Never buy stocks directly
2670 2018-02-05 20:55:17 “Our 401K?!...Our stocks?!...Our carried interest?!!! Heavens to Mergatroid !!! Whatever will we do?! We will have to sell the back 40 to make ends meet...Oooo I feel faint....”
2671 2018-02-05 20:55:15 I heard that you and your band have sold your stocks and bought bitcoin.

I heard that you and your band have sold your bitcoin and bought stocks.
2672 2018-02-05 20:55:15 Pay attention my people, stocks are tumbling, white people are panicking BUY STOCK NOW!!
2673 2018-02-05 20:55:11 Care to elaborate? Not sure I follow if you mean stocks will stay put at current levels??
2674 2018-02-05 20:55:08 Bounce back from 6600 levels. Got back in with $DGB and $ZCL . If it turn out to be THE DIP , great value for DGB, just 390 sat :)
2675 2018-02-05 20:55:07 Are they going to be available over the counter at your local friendly nuclear store?  Bit like bump stocks but a teeny bit more dangerous!  The mind boggles some days. No wonder people drink and take drugs!
2676 2018-02-05 20:55:04 Stocks are down 1100 points not good not good
2677 2018-02-05 20:55:01 DJI is burning Stocks are took a big dive.Its your fault.
2678 2018-02-05 20:54:59 The odds of that happening range between 0% and -5%. If the stocks go up afterwards will they give credit to Obama...again?
2679 2018-02-05 20:54:54 Stocks going down I’m over like im playing legacy soooo carry on  reading crushing it!! The work matters
2680 2018-02-05 20:54:51 Dow down at one time 1,700 points in a fast market. Stay long SPXS Bear fund. Last down still over a 1000. #Commodities #ETF #Stocks #Forex #Invest
2681 2018-02-05 20:54:45 F’weeks I hear stocks are way overpriced, we’re due for a big correction. Today: “omg we’re all gonna die!” #ffs
2682 2018-02-05 20:54:44 Why is it "shocking"? You'd be nuts not to sell some stocks with the Dow at 26,000+ and take some profits! It is still way above the 18,000 it was at in November 2016.
2683 2018-02-05 20:54:43 So stocks and crypto bounce at precisely the same time 
2684 2018-02-05 20:54:43 Stocks arent gonna go up when theres no buying pressure. Still love where i am with $PDXP. $BPMX nice swing in am. Dow down 1k+ be careful out there
2685 2018-02-05 20:54:42 I can't believe some people actually think their stocks are so great thanks to #45.
2686 2018-02-05 20:54:37 The only winners in the stock market mess are people who are in cash and have real fundamental type stocks whose real earnings and valuations always matter.
2687 2018-02-05 20:54:35 It was quite a ride. The Dow went from down 800 to down 1,500 in about 2 1/2 minutes and then started going back the other way almost as quickly. It made me happy that I was too poor to own stocks.
2688 2018-02-05 20:54:33 What? No tweets about how Prez Shitforbrains is causing the stock market to ..... wait.... it didn’t go up? Better tweet football instead huh. Yeah great game. Pay no attention to your stocks. It must have been Obama’s fault
2689 2018-02-05 20:54:33 So the stocks going up wasn’t him....but when they go down it’s all his fault right?
2690 2018-02-05 20:54:28 It is time to dump your #stock #market #stockmarket and buy in #Bitcoin $BTC if you arent late yet... Missing this chance? You might have one more chance, so dump your stocks lol :D #Disclaimer
2691 2018-02-05 20:54:25 I hope it goes Down even more.. that way I can afford to buy stocks with my 1.50 weekly tax break ... thanks Donnie 
2692 2018-02-05 20:54:24 Wait a minute so you’ve been heckling for a bear market for years and now a correction has shown for both stocks and crypto you are now willing to HODL both assets for years?! you don’t trade do you? You just watch and whinge either way.
2693 2018-02-05 20:54:24 Raleigh’s @RedHatNews -RHT- is one of the only stocks in the green today. For you market novices, green means up.
2694 2018-02-05 20:54:23 It’s days like today that I always remember a key stock market saying. “Stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down.”
2695 2018-02-05 20:54:19 Ohh. Stocks can go down? 
2696 2018-02-05 20:54:17 @MSNBC @AliVelshi  - Why aren’t you guys talking about the fallback in stocks as potentially related to an external event like speculation of an impending impeachment?!?
2697 2018-02-05 20:54:13 People are fuckin retarded and only notice stocks when they go down ala the Dow
2698 2018-02-05 20:54:12 IT and Energy Stocks don't seem to be losing much. I wonder which sections are taking the pounding? #NYSE
2699 2018-02-05 20:54:11 because the majority doesn't even own stocks. But having a job, getting a job, getting a bonus and getting higher pay that's what counts for all of us!
2700 2018-02-05 20:54:10 The stocks are being manipulated specifically to discredit POTUS.
2701 2018-02-05 20:54:08 So, I sold a substantial amount of stocks literally 5 days ago in both my and my parents' accounts to buy a house. I'm probably the luckiest SOB there is.
2702 2018-02-05 20:54:06 Wonder if our President is aware of stocks dropping right after his State of Union address...
Who is responsible?
2703 2018-02-05 20:53:57 Stocks have been way over inflated for years and the market is making a large adjustment for relocation's of funds from growth in new opening markets . "relax"
2704 2018-02-05 20:53:50 Stocks tumble, cryptos bubble, and Pats fans got humbled.  #cryptocrash #stocks #patslose
2705 2018-02-05 20:53:48 Don’t panic and pull your money out. Let it ride if time is on your side! #stocks
2706 2018-02-05 20:53:47 Do something @realDonaldTrump, before stocks fall more and you lose your tax money. Oh. Wait. You don't pay taxes.  #TrumpStockCrash #richpeopleproblems #saveyourtweets
2707 2018-02-05 20:53:38 Some stocks R overvalued. But the market is also based on earnings. & Earnings R coming in fantastic 4 most companies, & will continue 2 do so for the rest of the year. So don’t worry, market is on the way back up after the needed correction. We haven’t had 1 like this in a while
2708 2018-02-05 20:53:37 The fall of the U.S. stocks is not good news!
2709 2018-02-05 20:53:37 Taxes aren't the only thing going down #markets #stocks #StockMarket #marketcrash
2710 2018-02-05 20:53:34 Stocks tanked today. Thanks, @realDonaldTrump #TrumpFail
2711 2018-02-05 20:53:33 I am so happy I rotated out of stocks and put everything in @StalwartBX last Thursday morning.
2712 2018-02-05 20:53:32 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX, NDX top signal completion not possible today. If these complete it will be tomorrow morning, i.e., after 1000 (US EST).
2713 2018-02-05 20:53:29 How great would it be if $BTC found a low on the day they destroyed Stocks?
2714 2018-02-05 20:53:28 ah, glad i divested all my crypto into reliable, normal people stocks. now to take a big sip of tea and check the dow jones
2715 2018-02-05 20:53:24 Don't worry everyone, pot stocks are still up on the day, everything is fine. $WEED
2716 2018-02-05 20:53:23 $uav current investors and potential investors if you would like for @TechUav @higheyeaerial for photo updates at the Premier Sea Servies event in San Diego please like and retweet~ hopefully they see our support and update us from the event
2717 2018-02-05 20:53:23 Think of it another way.  There are only so many decades that you can keep buying just innernet stocks.
2718 2018-02-05 20:53:20 So go buy some stocks....what goes down must go up.
2719 2018-02-05 20:53:20 If you are a long-term investor, buy stocks now. Great prices, pick high quality companies #StockMarket
2720 2018-02-05 20:53:19 About time we need a pull back amd I love buying my stocks on Sale!
2721 2018-02-05 20:53:17 talking about people selling off other sectors and buying energy stocks such as apache
2722 2018-02-05 20:53:15 Have to play where the money is at. Taking the next few days to trade ETFs rather than Penny Stocks. Big Volume= Big Profit!
2723 2018-02-05 20:53:14 Ok, what stocks should I buy
2724 2018-02-05 20:53:13 Man if I knew how to buy a stocks I'd be getting these DOW lows right now if that's how it works. If I had any money. If I was using a computer instead of sending this by carrier pigeon. If I wasn't imaginary. Oh well, it was a good idea anyway.
2725 2018-02-05 20:53:04 Some stocks I like have now come down where they are more affordable. Buying some Tuesday.
2726 2018-02-05 20:53:04 realDonaldTrump POTUS Stephen says: Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics.
2727 2018-02-05 20:53:00 I guess it’s time to buy some stocks! #MAGA
2728 2018-02-05 20:52:58 People don't know what stocks works and just saying shit to get at drumpf
2729 2018-02-05 20:52:57 My stocks
2730 2018-02-05 20:52:57 I don't think it's completely separate either though - stocks are used as loan collateral, equity for company purchases, equity reserves for banks, etc. Stock prices can impact economic activity. (disclaimer: I'm not an economist.)
2731 2018-02-05 20:52:54 Stock Market so far fell 900 points today. People are selling off their stocks.
2732 2018-02-05 20:52:50 Stocks are taking a hit! Welcome to the CryptoVerse #TheCrossover #Bitcoin #Crypto
2733 2018-02-05 20:52:46 Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr , how are your stocks doing today???
2734 2018-02-05 20:52:46 Don't believe the fake news.  Stocks tanking but Trump will tell you how phenomenal the VIX is doing! #trumpdump
2735 2018-02-05 20:52:45 I believe the Dems have hatched a plot to sell their stocks and make the market appear to be falling.
2736 2018-02-05 20:52:42 Stock Market CLIMBS 40% under Trump's 1st year in office - Lib Media ignores.

Stocks correct 4% - Lib Media "STOCK MARKET! STOCK MARKET! STOCK MARKET!"
2737 2018-02-05 20:52:35 Clearly you don't understand how markets work. Can't go up forever without taking some lumps once in awhile. Stocks are tanking right now too, I guarantee they'll be back up at some point.
2738 2018-02-05 20:52:31 Those big investors at it in the Media again. Sell your stocks, margin calls, we are afraid of inflation. Then they buy in for lower price.
2739 2018-02-05 20:52:31 Yah I'm not sitting on any stocks either.
2740 2018-02-05 20:52:18 Oh look, Some spinless, paranoid Americans selling off more stocks again. Thanks for ruining it for the majority of us!
2741 2018-02-05 20:52:17 Ugh, simplifying radical expressions? Finding the missing side w/ Pythagorean Theorem? G-o-metric means????? I’m too rich for this, all you need to know is stocks!       #stocks
2742 2018-02-05 20:52:17 Wow. Days like this are never easy.  Taking the good with the bad.   #Stocks #DownDay #DownBigly
2743 2018-02-05 20:52:12 Gonna have to choose between talking points that it's a cynical tax cut to benefit corporations and rich people, versus corporate stocks are dropping because tax cuts.
2744 2018-02-05 20:52:09 Stocks plunge after OHIO visit and lounge room speech! #TrumpEffect sucks! Trump loses nothing as Putin  continues to pay him for wrecking America! @realDonaldTrump @funder @maddow @RVAwonk @ananavarro @Anti_DJTrump @DearAuntCrabby @SpeakerRyan
2745 2018-02-05 20:52:08 Rising interest rates means that there are more vehicles for profit and selling stocks is how you get the capital for that investment. Try grasping basic economics.
2746 2018-02-05 20:52:06 My poor stocks I. n Dow Jones. Just tragic. Mrpresident, we need a stock market holiday! @realDonaldTrump suspend trading until we can figure out what the hell is going on!
2747 2018-02-05 20:52:02 U.S. Stocks Plummet, Erasing Gains for the Year. Thanks TRUMP and your oligarch buddies for screwing America. Lady Liberty will not sit idle for much longer.
2748 2018-02-05 20:51:52 Didn't play green stocks today but did lock in 15% (as market was plunging) in $EYES in a few hours using your strategies. THANKS
2749 2018-02-05 20:51:50 Lol
2750 2018-02-05 20:51:47 “Stocks Down Amidst Fear of (fill in the blank)”

Bunch of pussies.
2751 2018-02-05 20:51:42 This could be it. Now is the time for #stocks to #crypto flippening.
2752 2018-02-05 20:51:38 For the first time in a long time. I started buying stocks in meaningful numbers and not just a few hundred shares today. Still have a large portion of cash but at least getting back into action today
2753 2018-02-05 20:51:35 Perhaps buying stocks or bitcoins?
2754 2018-02-05 20:51:35 Patriots losing bad for the economy, stocks, and crypto. 
2755 2018-02-05 20:51:34 U.S. Stocks Plummet, Erasing Gains for the Year. Thanks TRUMP and your oligarch buddies for screwing America. Lady Liberty will not sit idle for much longer.
2756 2018-02-05 20:51:34 I’ll be looking forward to that $1.50 like Paul Ryan’s girl got while the stocks tank..
2757 2018-02-05 20:51:33 I’m retired. How does it help me?  I depend on stocks. Oh yeah. THAT’S down over a 1000 pts right now. Down buggy the last week. Thanks for nothing!  By the way, stop lying to your base. Any money back this year will go away next year.
2758 2018-02-05 20:51:30 @FoxNews Stocks, money flow, and the federal budget, as a family that relies on a check from the VA, doesn't the congress realize that the military, disabled vets, and government employees tighten their wallets every time they approach and then extend the deadline.
2759 2018-02-05 20:51:27 I want to watch it burn bc only 14% of Americans directly invest in stocks, so basically it falling does wonders for income inequality. But also, fuck Trump.
2760 2018-02-05 20:51:27 as much as I don't want it to be I think the "Isca" might be being up 2 stocks game 1, Jeff saying something about how good my Sonic is, then immediately losing the set 2-0
2761 2018-02-05 20:51:26 I said watch bonds the other day. Municipal's will follow suit. Bond market. Sell stocks to buy bonds/long term % high.
2762 2018-02-05 20:51:26 Yes but my stocks are tanking!  Thanks for nothing.
2763 2018-02-05 20:51:26 RT StephenKing "Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics."
2764 2018-02-05 20:51:22 Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics.
2765 2018-02-05 20:51:21 The thing I love about Wall Street is that when stocks go up, I definitely get nothing and when they go down, I possibly get fired.
2766 2018-02-05 20:51:21 Way up -- a whole $1.50 a week if you are lucky. Meanwhile, if you own stocks...well, that's another matter.
2767 2018-02-05 20:51:21 stocks are going way down too
2768 2018-02-05 20:51:12 Not quite a crash yet, a correction for now and will likely continue throughout the week. Most stocks were overvalued, DOW is still up by around 17% overall since 2017.
2769 2018-02-05 20:51:10 I LOVE how all my stocks have crashed as I’m about to retire! Thanks @realDonaldTrump .  And If anyone thinks #Obama is to blame you need to #STFU and go back to Fox News and continue to refuse to fact check.
2770 2018-02-05 20:51:05 I’m completely fascinated by the  DOW fluctuating... I mean... not enough to reinstall my stocks app or anything crazy like that.
2771 2018-02-05 20:51:03 Tweeter is fun and all but I don't see it or Facebook having much intrinsic value. They're worth something.  Maybe $25-50 million each but that's all.  They're essentially smallcap stocks in my book.
2772 2018-02-05 20:50:58 What is up with these stocks 
2773 2018-02-05 20:50:54 Yes the brakes on the Stock Market are based on a %. Current downturn could just be a correction to get stocks back to their real value. Too early to know if this is a sign of a bear market or people just taking profits. If this becomes a weekly/monthly downturn then it's bad.
2774 2018-02-05 20:50:42 This is what 45 and the @GOP wanted with the #TaxScamBill . These corporations will buy back their stocks at pennies on the dollar..why should they pay full price when they can sink it. Gov't shuts downs 45 blames on Dems..days later go back to work and market will rise again
2775 2018-02-05 20:50:41 Trump just announced that now is the time to buy casino stocks, especially Wynn preferred issues.
2776 2018-02-05 20:50:40 Oh boy can't wait to save up my 1.50 a week increase. So I can buy some stocks...oh wait might not be a good time for that.
2777 2018-02-05 20:50:35 Join me at 4ET on @FoxBusiness on @AftertheBell to talk about the wild moves in #Stocks along with @adamlashinsky
2778 2018-02-05 20:50:33 Stocks take dive, thanks Eagles 
2779 2018-02-05 20:50:32 The new great rotation: out of crashing stocks and into cryptos
2780 2018-02-05 20:50:32 My stocks are tanking.
2781 2018-02-05 20:50:29 And our ret & investment accounts going way down. Hey, w/o #HealthInsurance or #Environmental protections, we will die younger than people living in 1st world countries so we need less $!

Trump making US the best 3rd world country ever. Way to #MAGA !

#stocks #dowjones #RESIST
2782 2018-02-05 20:50:29 Why isn't Dana's show on CNN?  She hates Trump and stocks her show with kindred spirits.
2783 2018-02-05 20:50:28 Good!!! Stocks plunges past 1,000 + points. Watch Trump blame Hillary Clinton for the Dow plunge
2784 2018-02-05 20:50:27 Deacons have unanimously agreed, by one accord, to short the market, move into physical gold and silver. Drops in stocks too much to bear.
2785 2018-02-05 20:50:17 the entire #potstock sector is weak today .. in volume , which is dollars trading. bad for the fluff penny stocks in the space and better for the real companies with real revenues and earnings .  #MMJ #CANNABIS
2786 2018-02-05 20:50:17 My paycheck hasn’t gone up at all, and stocks are dropping like a lead balloon!
2787 2018-02-05 20:50:17 $WFC had to unload some risky assets...stocks
2788 2018-02-05 20:50:15 What a lovely reminder that stocks go up like stairs but tank like a lift
2789 2018-02-05 20:50:09 U.S. Stocks Plummet, Erasing Gains for the Year. Thanks TRUMP.
2790 2018-02-05 20:50:08 Clearly don't know anything about stocks. #StayInYoLane
2791 2018-02-05 20:50:07 Several stocks on my computer have given up over half the retracement of their flash crash. Not over? $spy
2792 2018-02-05 20:50:03 Stock market reports  by prophets of doom and gloom. Pundits like Shepard Smith only see numbers and talk about stock markets. Investors know stocks and invest in the future gains. Predictions are educated guesses.
2793 2018-02-05 20:50:03 Hey! I'm at peace with my lust, I can kill because in God I trust! (Also buying stocks on the day of the crash but that's too obvious)
2794 2018-02-05 20:50:02 Blackstone Billionaire President and COO Tony James: 

"Stocks Could Fall As Much As 20% This Year"

They could go up more
2795 2018-02-05 20:49:59 European stocks tomorrow: get ready for bubbles like @FeverTreeMixers to start unwinding. Might taste good w/your gin, but shares supremely overvalued @FTAlphaville @SmallCapsUK @business @MartinSLewis @SkyBusiness
2796 2018-02-05 20:49:58 Stocks down 900 points. #Trumpisevil #TrumpEconomy #Nazis #resist
2797 2018-02-05 20:49:57 @realDonaldTrump  Help, stocks in free fall. What's your solution? VP is praying. @POTUS Oh go golfing save us your ignorance.
2798 2018-02-05 20:49:53 U.S. Stocks Plummet, Erasing Gains for the Year. Thanks TRUMP.
2799 2018-02-05 20:49:48 Do not look at your stocks right now. Just save yourself the time and know that you are down. Hello correction.
2800 2018-02-05 20:49:46 Good call. Short on stocks would be my take.
2801 2018-02-05 20:49:42 Is your an idiot your selling stocks at this point instead of buying. #wallstreet
2802 2018-02-05 20:49:30 You have a bunch of people sell stocks for a stupid reason like inflation is coming.
2803 2018-02-05 20:49:28 Wow... with an extra $1.50 a week, I might be able to 100% contribution match what my stocks are now gonna be worth.  #DowJones
2804 2018-02-05 20:49:27 Hey stock market, it’s been a long couple days, you can take tomorrow off, ok? #stocks
2805 2018-02-05 20:49:26 Hopefully rather than tweet they'll pull their cash from stocks and put it into a bargain asset like #crypto
2806 2018-02-05 20:49:26 Funny how I leave the USA and the DOW drops. My family no longer holding up the US economy. Also I would sell any US beer stocks, sales will be plummeting after last week.
2807 2018-02-05 20:49:25 @GOP @realDonaldTrump still #winning #biggly #maga by bankrupting Americans who have stocks - is this what you had in mind?  #recession on the horizon? #GOPTaxScam #TrumpStockCrash #GOPStockCrash #TrumpTaxScam #KochTaxScam #WEALTHFARE #BlueTsunami2018 #BlueWave2018

2810 2018-02-05 20:49:18 while you were all busy tweeting out "more like down jones lol" I was busy buying up all the stocks
2811 2018-02-05 20:49:11 Stocks have been going up for 9 years but Trump gave no credit to Obama. Can’t have it both ways.
2812 2018-02-05 20:49:10 Creating a Yuge deficit and gifting billionaires. Are you taking credit for the sell off today in stocks?
2813 2018-02-05 20:49:06 yes, markets repricing.. wait until the pension funds come in for sale.. Bonds down, stocks down, retiree’s won’t be happy..
2814 2018-02-05 20:49:04 This is why I prefer Mickey's Fine Malt Liquor tallboys to stocks
2815 2018-02-05 20:49:03 Memo effect, everyone dumping stocks of corporations tied to Obama, Clinton's and Clinton Foundation. Smart move.
2816 2018-02-05 20:49:00 I tell everyone to invest in very low fee index funds (not individual stocks or high fee mutual funds).

As long as you are not about to retire, market drops are buying opportunities.

It's as if something just went on sale at the supermarket. Bigger drops = bigger sales.
2817 2018-02-05 20:48:55 Wow dont know the stocks very well relax.
2818 2018-02-05 20:48:46 Why can't stocks take the elevator up and the stairs down for once?
2819 2018-02-05 20:48:45 Stocks falling on stupid news.  Big investors and banks taking profits and hoping stupid investors sell off big time so they can scoop up some bargains and make more money on the inevitable rise.

#TheDow
2820 2018-02-05 20:48:44 Take a repugnant and clueless president,pass a tax bill that not only blows up the deficit,but hits the debt ceiling & you wonder why stocks are off. Now wait until #FatNixon insults the biggest buyer of our debt, the Chinese. They turn the tap off and we're screwed.
2821 2018-02-05 20:48:43 Oh... and your stocks and retirement are going down too.
2822 2018-02-05 20:48:36 Umm Gordon, yeah, we took some losses today.

#WallStreet $SPY $IWM #Stocks
2823 2018-02-05 20:48:34  Stocks tanked again on the heels of their worst week in 2 years, losing about 4% at one point during volatile trading (NY Times) L’index S&P et le DOW en baisse de 4%
2824 2018-02-05 20:48:31 I'm trying. I just watched "Dirty Money" on Netflix this weekend and I still don't totally understand what short selling is. Picking losing stocks? Isn't that a bad idea?
2825 2018-02-05 20:48:30 Stocks not so good though
2826 2018-02-05 20:48:28 I don't own stocks - I have a 401k!! The same way my health insurance isn't that crappy Obamacare, it's through the ACA!!! #MAGA
2827 2018-02-05 20:48:27 I'll also hazard a guess that a lot of them are the same geniuses that are selling their stocks en mass and taking heavy losses.
2828 2018-02-05 20:48:25 Oh c'mon. So stocks went down a little. Taken in stride with just how far it's risen in the last several months, no big cause for concern.

2831 2018-02-05 20:48:14 Thanks to your/#GOPTaxScam & other policies we are seeing a 10% drop in stocks in a week. The @GOP creates bubbles & destroys our economy over and over! We need @TheDemocrats back in control to fix it AGAIN! #TrickleDownGushesUp
2832 2018-02-05 20:48:14 What goes up must come down. So, look at it this way, stocks are now on sale!
2833 2018-02-05 20:48:12 The research says gold is a safe haven for stocks on days like today. Safe haven is its fundamental. @brianmlucey
2834 2018-02-05 20:48:07 Now wondering how much of that Corporate tax cut employee bonus money was plowed into stocks.....
2835 2018-02-05 20:48:04 as long as you have a mutual funds portfolio with a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, stable commodities, and... and... yeah, there goes my state and city pensions too. /cries
2836 2018-02-05 20:47:59 haha I was thinking the same thing, stocks are overdue for a correction.
2837 2018-02-05 20:47:44 this headline got a readspike

Trump Lauds ‘Tidal Wave of Good News’ as U.S. Stocks Plummet
2838 2018-02-05 20:47:43 Vol markets are pretty messed up now and until they get back in balance stocks aren't going anywhere.
2839 2018-02-05 20:47:41 US stocks looking very volatile!
2840 2018-02-05 20:47:41 U.S. Stocks Plummet, Erasing Gains for the Year. Thanks TRUMP.
2841 2018-02-05 20:47:40 He only responds on the positive I always knew stocks have nothing to do with what a president does it only shows what a hypocrite he truly is.
2842 2018-02-05 20:47:39 Now that the DOW is crashing, surely there are lots of no-stockers that are tweeting about how stocks are inherently worthless and they predicted this bubble pop years ago, right?
2843 2018-02-05 20:47:35 It's sorta weird that we hedge stocks with speculation on expensive rocks and governments.
2844 2018-02-05 20:47:35 Gonna be honest I don't understand what stocks mean
2845 2018-02-05 20:47:27 @realDonaldTrump Stocks tanked again today, after dropping like an anvil last week.
2846 2018-02-05 20:47:27 Satoshi is already running the banks, stocks and everything. Or the stocks are all too heavily invested in crypto (Secretly.)
2847 2018-02-05 20:47:26 Couple of thoughts on stock dive today:  for the year, stocks up 0.7%; what spooks markets is wage growth in jobs report, inflation fears. It was @realDonaldTrump who accused Fed of helping Obama with low rates. He now will get to enjoy transition to a higher rate environment
2848 2018-02-05 20:47:25 I am so worried about my stocks portfolio
2849 2018-02-05 20:47:19 Stock market down bigtime last 2 sessions? I suppose it's Trumps fault even though Dems gaveTrump zero credit when stocks went up after his election? Hard to comprehend such logic?
2850 2018-02-05 20:47:18 person: omg what's happening with the stocks  

me: can we talk about margot robbie's iconic performance in 'wolf of wall street'
2851 2018-02-05 20:47:17 Today's friendly anti-FUD reminder: You can't buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or commodities with credit cards either. #cryptocurrency
2852 2018-02-05 20:47:16 But that moron brags that he brought up the stocks in past one year, doesn't it work both ways?
2853 2018-02-05 20:47:14 it looks vulnerable....and energy stocks act like crap
2854 2018-02-05 20:47:10 The thing about learning even a little bit about the stock market is that: everyone making The Big Decisions around stocks is a fucking idiot. Like, without exception
2855 2018-02-05 20:47:09 Buy individual stocks.  Not the market  ;-)
2856 2018-02-05 20:47:05 I bought my first stocks last week.

I am an idiot.
2857 2018-02-05 20:47:04 Stocks can be exchanged for goods and services.
2858 2018-02-05 20:46:59 Pretzels  & hummus . I need to replenish my salt & protein stocks.
2859 2018-02-05 20:46:57 Stocks and bonds yields both flash crashed as well
2860 2018-02-05 20:46:55 So that's true about Robots now doing stocks? Thank you - make sense.
2861 2018-02-05 20:46:53 Trump takes credit when stocks are  climbing. Will he take responsibilty for it crashing?!
Yeah, he'll play the blame game
2862 2018-02-05 20:46:48 ...and what's happening with our STOCKS???
2863 2018-02-05 20:46:47 I'm guessing you don't know how stocks or 401ks work
2864 2018-02-05 20:46:47 maybe people sold their stocks to get into crypto
2865 2018-02-05 20:46:46 The stock market nearly lost $1 trillion this week. 
And what can history teach us about that?

Well, the market will always recover.

2866 2018-02-05 20:46:44 This drop in stocks was long overdue.
2867 2018-02-05 20:46:42 Nie zazdroszczę jutrzejszego dnia maklerom. Pracującym w Polsce. Zagranica sobie poradzi, ale w PL jutro rzeź. #wig #stocks
2868 2018-02-05 20:46:41 YEPEEE WHAT IS TRUMP GOING TO SAY NOW THAT THE WALL STREET STOCKS HAVE HAD A HEAVY  FALL?  " IT IS OBAMA'S FAULT" LOL
2869 2018-02-05 20:46:40 CRIS COLLINSWORTH [as the Dow plunges 1500 points]: We’re gonna have to get a better look at this, but I think stocks are actually going up here
2870 2018-02-05 20:46:39 And the stocks are doing a nose dive while gas prices are going sky high
2871 2018-02-05 20:46:35 I'm losing $$ in stocks you baffoon! Fix it!
2872 2018-02-05 20:46:35 Sell your stocks!  I sold all of my stocks Friday morning, in protest of trump and the evil corporations that support him! They only understand money, so take it all from them, so they can feel our pain!
#WomensMarch #indivisible #DowJones #Trump #grabyourwallet
2873 2018-02-05 20:46:30 What a day! Now to check my stocks...
2874 2018-02-05 20:46:30 easy on the youngsters, my 30yr old buddy slammed the desk before month saying vix and stocks are going to hurt people badly at a major hedge fund within a bulge bracket bank and they all laughed at him
2875 2018-02-05 20:46:29 I'm hardly an expert (and most so-called experts aren't either), but there is herd behavior of sellers including automatic computer trading that can move the market quickly. I think the real underlying story is interest rates moving to more normal levels--affects stocks too.
2876 2018-02-05 20:46:28 My stocks have been dropping like crazy all day
2877 2018-02-05 20:46:27 Okay so im not saying it’s time to buy but when the market gets that low you know certain stocks will bounce right back up and now maybe the time...
2878 2018-02-05 20:46:26 10% corrections happen all the time when the stocks get over valued like this! Don’t panic, it’s gonna come back. If you’re not retiring today, you don’t have anything to worry about.
2879 2018-02-05 20:46:26 I just own some stocks.
2880 2018-02-05 20:46:25 crazy moves.  didn't look like a lot of volume in most stocks
2881 2018-02-05 20:46:17 I'm not glad to see this happen but it was expected. Stocks are overvalued & now interest rates are rising. That's why I got out a couple of weeks ago. Also the growth rate is going to slow & we won't be able to pay for these tax cuts.
2882 2018-02-05 20:46:14 #DowJones dropped 1500 points today. Thank you Mr. President.

#stocks #StockMarket #StockMarketCRASH
2883 2018-02-05 20:46:09 In theory... interest rates rising = stocks less attractive.
2884 2018-02-05 20:46:08 @GOP @realDonaldTrump still #winning #biggly #maga by bankrupting Americans who have stocks - is this what you had in mind?  #recession on the horizon? #GOPTaxScam #TrumpStockCrash #GOPStockCrash #TrumpTaxScam #KochTaxScam #WEALTHFARE #BlueTsunami2018 #BlueWave2018
2885 2018-02-05 20:46:07 This is what the @GOP and 45 hoped for..don't you get it? Stock market crashes, then gov't shutdown, Corporations like Koch Ind. buy back all their stock at pennies on the dollar..gov't goes back to work..stocks go back up..this is a set up
2886 2018-02-05 20:46:06 @TechUav looking forward to some photos at the san diego convention yay at least we have something good to look forward to $uav rather than the markets lol
2887 2018-02-05 20:46:06 People who buy stocks on margin are looking for a way to lose money automatically.
2888 2018-02-05 20:46:06 Are the Astronomy related stocks getting hit pretty hard? :-)
2889 2018-02-05 20:46:05 And I mean these stocks are plunging. Could this be a ploy for the market to collapse and the super wealthy buy up everything for the ultimate takeover... 
2890 2018-02-05 20:46:05 $1 trillion market cap 'wiped' off US stocks today......after $22.5 trillion 'wiped' on over the past 8 years 
2891 2018-02-05 20:46:05 No panic here though. I'm long in everything.  Worst thing you can do is panic or make emotional decisions. Way I see it, stocks I'm interested in will be more reasonably priced #DowJones
2892 2018-02-05 20:46:03 That's exactly right Mr Mitchell! This separates the weak stocks from the strong Investments going forward.
2893 2018-02-05 20:46:00 “Stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down.” —Me
2894 2018-02-05 20:45:58 Stocks dive, Dow down nearly 1000 points, erasing all gains in 2018.  We've been way overdue for pullback, really no news behind this recent drop #fox35
2895 2018-02-05 20:45:57 Stocks are plunging
2896 2018-02-05 20:45:57 So, does that mean I don't gain money when stocks go up? What's @realDonaldTrump bragging about when market goes up then?
2897 2018-02-05 20:45:52 See: Equifax.  (Exposed millions of peoples' personal info. Didn't tell anyone. Sold tons of stocks. Made $$$$$$$ b4 telling public about security breach.)
2898 2018-02-05 20:45:52 To put things into perspective, the stock market lost over $1t in February alone. Thats more than the entire crypto market was even at their all time highs. So ask yourself, which was in a bubble and which was just realizing their potential. $BTC $ETH #Bitcoin #stocks #crypto
2899 2018-02-05 20:45:46 I can’t wait for Trump to blame someone brown for the stocks tanking. Very on brand, of course.
2900 2018-02-05 20:45:43 Stocks are dropping faster than you can say #impeachment
2901 2018-02-05 20:45:43 The media didn't care when stocks increased for the last year and we made a lot of money, now horrible day and guess what... Give me a break...
2902 2018-02-05 20:45:41 Stocks tanking ATM.
2903 2018-02-05 20:45:38 There should be a CBS News Special Report in about 15 minutes including Central and Mountain time zones -- Dow Jones stocks down nearly 1000 points from open and lowest intraday since at least 2008.
2904 2018-02-05 20:45:37 Looking forward to trump writing an executive order that just says "Rise" and signing it when stocks start ticking back up
2905 2018-02-05 20:45:34 no i m Engineer he he.. Its just i have invested in Bitcoin so i follow the trends. rest i hav no idea about stocks and all.. he he. Nifty Sensex i dnt knw anything about them.
2906 2018-02-05 20:45:33 Hopefully not stocks.
2907 2018-02-05 20:45:32 Stocks down. 1.52 weekly raise
2908 2018-02-05 20:45:30 You got out after Trump won. You told everyone to sell their stocks. Now you're the all insightful? Unreal.
2909 2018-02-05 20:45:29 *Borat voice*  my stocks
2910 2018-02-05 20:45:28 im selling all my stocks and going to bitcoins
2911 2018-02-05 20:45:27 Apparently you're not in cryptocurrency, the correction came hard and fast and still going, same will happen to stocks, so HODL on tight!!!
2912 2018-02-05 20:45:17 Now is the time for stocks to crypto flippening
2913 2018-02-05 20:45:13 My advice is to buy up stocks in Dow Jones while they’re at a all time low.
2914 2018-02-05 20:45:12 And stocks, how is the stock market?
2915 2018-02-05 20:45:12 Tbh stocks need to crash another 1500 points considering this 8 yr bull run we just had.
2916 2018-02-05 20:45:02 So what’s up with the stock market? I don’t understand stocks at all
2917 2018-02-05 20:45:02 Those that sell stocks as the market peaks and buy them back after the market bottoms out do very we well #MondayMotivation Those that hold on and or sell late lose all the gains they had acquired.
2918 2018-02-05 20:45:00 Maybe he'll take credit that stocks are now more "affordable" for the forgotten man. :)
2919 2018-02-05 20:44:59 @AftertheBell #crash / Stocks dive cause traders realize deep state can use phony Russia dossier to get warrant and spy on Trump team. Also stocks wary as Dems refuse to govern. And then there is fed. @POTUS
2920 2018-02-05 20:44:59 how are your stocks doing? $spx $iwm
2921 2018-02-05 20:44:54 if it goes below the 19K he started with then there is something rotten in Denmark, otherwise… corrections are healthy, and avoid bubbles.

Plus higher wages mean lower stocks in normal times.
2922 2018-02-05 20:44:52 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #stock.market.crash. Why are the stocks dropping?  #failure #impeachment #resign.while.you.can
2923 2018-02-05 20:44:52 Kramer will not be ok ....he got his folks into stocks past few weeks
2924 2018-02-05 20:44:51 Low key I’m glad the stock market is down , I can buy more stocks low now 
2925 2018-02-05 20:44:49 robo advisor its a wealth management back office software that facilitates the portfolio rebalancing performance etc ,,, or its a day to day trading software that operates the assets - stocks in my portfolio ?
2926 2018-02-05 20:44:46 Wow, the DOW down almost 1000 points in two days. You must have some amazing stocks.
2927 2018-02-05 20:44:44 CRAZY DONNY running a sale on stocks
2928 2018-02-05 20:44:41 Stocks go down, computers programmed to do auto selloffs, stocks fall more, everyone loses their sh*t and sells to take a loss. Way to go guys
2929 2018-02-05 20:44:39 Apparently the DOW stocks are nosediving... @POTUS has been bragging about how great the stocks have been for months due to his election. Wonder how he’ll spin this 
2930 2018-02-05 20:44:37 Took one look at my stocks a few hours ago and now I'm just trying this whole ignorance is bliss thing for a while because YIKES
2931 2018-02-05 20:44:35 I'm sorry to report this, but I don't think Trump will consider it bad news. I bet he'll find a way to blame the economic uncertainty on the Trump Russia investigation.

"Russia investigation bad for investors. There is "no" collusion, "Trump" is vindicated. STOCKS WILL RISE!"
2932 2018-02-05 20:44:27 Bloodbath on all fronts. Still hodl on crypto-stocks different story.
2933 2018-02-05 20:44:25 Stocks are getting smoked again.
2934 2018-02-05 20:44:23 You have these idiots talking on sotck correction on you program..This is Russian dropping stocks on us..That was the plan with that Russian money Laundering. 21 to 26 ,00 was Russian Drug money coming in tru Trump families and oregarts.
2935 2018-02-05 20:44:16 A reminder that the stock market is not the same thing as the economy. 

Most people don't own stocks.
2936 2018-02-05 20:44:15 Should measure in % not points. Also should ignore the Dow, S&P 500 is a better measure. Dow is only 30 stocks and is share price weighted rather than market cap.
2937 2018-02-05 20:44:15 Needed: #Stock charting software as good as (or better than) #tc2000, with reliable data. Because the data problems in tc2000 are just killing me. 

#trading #stocks #market
2938 2018-02-05 20:44:13 The stock market DROP IS GOOD b/c now many more ppl will be able to buy stocks. Many ppl. were not buying at those ridiculously high prices of 26,000+
2939 2018-02-05 20:44:12 Good day for me who still has like 25 years left before I need to touch my investments, anytime it goes down it's cheaper for me to buy stocks.
2940 2018-02-05 20:44:10 Gonna be fine.  Bond yields are up...people are putting more cash there just to hedge on volatility of the meteoric rise of the past year.

It'll pass, and stocks will start climbing again.
2941 2018-02-05 20:44:09 Hardly! I got less on my refund this year! How's "your economy" doing today? Stocks dropped a lot!
2942 2018-02-05 20:44:09 Sorry stocks are DOWN again today.
2943 2018-02-05 20:44:07 No, Actually I am a very long term trader at heart.. but having worked in the industry I know its not wise to invest thinking stocks only go up. Ask any day trader how well that thinking worked.  Diversity, diversity, diversity.
2944 2018-02-05 20:44:03 Market corrections are normal. 

Having trmp bleat about “his” Dow numbers is not.

The real ticker to watch is the Nasdac. Dow is only avg of 30 stocks. Nasdac is 3300+.
2945 2018-02-05 20:44:03 Collectively people will pay less for ownership of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow than they would yesterday.
2946 2018-02-05 20:44:02 Stocks went down again 
2947 2018-02-05 20:43:53 My loose stocks, my 401 K index funds, Cryptocurrency, and all because interest rates are expected to rise
2948 2018-02-05 20:43:49 “Somebody said, they told me, that it was the biggest drop in stocks in a single day that the world has ever known.”
2949 2018-02-05 20:43:48 Thanks to historic OBSTRUCTION from you our stocks are TANKING. Way to go DOTARD.
2950 2018-02-05 20:43:47 The stock market is doing great!

- Every Trump Supporter that doesn't have any stocks.
2951 2018-02-05 20:43:46 Schiff is not partying because gold is MIA since stocks crashed.  Bitcoin however... 
2952 2018-02-05 20:43:39 $SPY #stocks The market dipped below 2717 50dma, then 2700 psychological level. When it went negative YTD, selling accelerated till it neared 100dma and then it rebounded. A lot of people were caught offside and had to sell/hedge. Hovering near '17 closing level (flat on year)
2953 2018-02-05 20:43:36 Between @cvpayne @ericbolling and @JCLayfield I don't sweat the stocks anymore.  If they don't panic, neither do I.
2954 2018-02-05 20:43:34 It's fun mocking 'it' and the fall of stocks and all.... but this could hurt a lot of people, even those who have no stocks at all. In fact, way it usually works, in finance as in war, the less economically privileged are exactly who take the hit.
2955 2018-02-05 20:43:32 Interesting day today! Buying opportunity? #stocks #equities #SPX

2957 2018-02-05 20:43:30 its why I trust @FoxBusiness they are talking about the ETFs and how this is not fundamental, just technical.....some stocks are way too rich and over valued. You can see it in the PEs..
stay the course if youre in...diversify if your not and wait to jump in once it settles
2958 2018-02-05 20:43:29 Stocks are down again today. KKKlown. 


2959 2018-02-05 20:43:28 Anyone bitching about stocks.thank the doj,the democrats, and the fbi..thanks for being unethical ,morally bankrupt.pieces of shit
2960 2018-02-05 20:43:25 And ur stocks are going WAY WAY down!
2961 2018-02-05 20:43:20 Hey George, trying to locate tweet you replied to w/ Adam Schiff. Currently peeking at tax scam causing stocks to dive. Course it could be Trumps lawlessness! @GStreepy
2962 2018-02-05 20:43:19 The point I was making is that racist trump boasts that when stocks go up it’s all down to him, but when they go down racist trump  is silent.
2963 2018-02-05 20:43:18 New GOP talking point: "After a full year of tremendous gains all directly attributable to Trump, people briefly remembered that Obama was President and Hillary won the popular vote, which is why stocks are down now. Clearly Democrats' fault."
2964 2018-02-05 20:43:16 Market correction. Many of us knew it was coming. People will flock to precious metals for safety like they always do, then the other stocks will recover. Endless, vicious cycle
2965 2018-02-05 20:43:15 Nothing like getting notifications that my long term stocks reached their stop-losses on my phone when I'm at the airport. #GottaActFast #StillMadeMoney
2966 2018-02-05 20:43:12 But stocks going down, did they let you know?
2967 2018-02-05 20:43:11 "Stocks are plunging because people's wages are beginning to rise again" is not capitalism's best look.
2968 2018-02-05 20:43:08 I'm not ready to read fundamental crash.  I think you're seeing a market correction of overvalued stocks.   I'm not seeing more than that, yet.  Check with me tomorow
2969 2018-02-05 20:43:04 reporters be honest, you don’t have stocks, please get back to paying attention to the Newsweek travesty thank you
2970 2018-02-05 20:42:59 With the US stocks falling, we might see some of that money rush into crypto.
2971 2018-02-05 20:42:59 Stocks down again and it's all Trump's fault. Make America Grumpy Again
2972 2018-02-05 20:42:59 No hay burbuja en stocks. Es una simple corrección.
2973 2018-02-05 20:42:57 Relax about the #DowJones, peoples. We all knew a market correction was coming because stocks were overvalued. Everyone but Trump apparently. It is kind of funny that it dove when Trump was on TV, bragging about his economic prowess.
2974 2018-02-05 20:42:53 Prediction y’all: Blame will be placed on the Dow Jones Industrial Index itself or computers that buy/sell quickly as reason for downturn. #Dow #stocks
2975 2018-02-05 20:42:47 honestly it's really comforting that we're all talking about stocks today because i feel so much more confident in my understanding of markets than of attempts to dismantle democracy and the rule of law at the highest levels of american government
2976 2018-02-05 20:42:43 @GregMannarino What stocks are you watching for a potential #long position when the selloff stops?
2977 2018-02-05 20:42:43 I have some stocks (Mom's stocks) in my eTrade. I asked last week if she wanted to cash them in when the market was high. Nope. (I have not talked to her today.) 
2978 2018-02-05 20:42:38 Great time to buy great stocks on sale 10% off
2979 2018-02-05 20:42:34 Good timing. I thought the same thing in 2014 for 6 months, and again b4 the 2016 election. I've read too much Graham, Bernstein, Malkiel, similar 2 think I can time the market more successfully than the big-$ firms that employ smart folks who spend 60 hrs/week studying stocks
2980 2018-02-05 20:42:34 Rip stocks
2981 2018-02-05 20:42:32 To the millionaires & billionaires withdraw your money from stocks and cause a massive layoff as the Great Depression or 2008 a massive lawsuit should occur that will effect to many businesses and others finances. Been waiting for you to withdraw money you made from extortion.
2982 2018-02-05 20:42:27 #DowJones rallied but is now in Free Fall again dropped 200points in 2 minutes. Will investors try to dump stocks in the last 15mins of trading?
2983 2018-02-05 20:42:27 Will we ever see which stocks and who sold them? I have my hunches it some really really rich D. supporters who threatened to take down the Prez. Of course MSM won't ever publish that info
2984 2018-02-05 20:42:27 Low bids HY stocks tomorrow, nothing else
2985 2018-02-05 20:42:27 You losing fat cash on the stocks huh
2986 2018-02-05 20:42:26 Just wishful thinking as bonds and stocks are crashing, will some of those guys come to #bitcoin and #Crypto. It is not far stretched, when years on savings account money started moving last year......
2987 2018-02-05 20:42:23 True, though this might be step-one in a series of a large correction. Bet a lot of margin calls have taken place today. Dow down 5% usually means much higher declines for less mainstream stocks.
2988 2018-02-05 20:42:22 When the only republican(Trey G) to see the full extent of the dirt on trump and his peeps due to the fisa application and retires immediately after seeing the fisa app. That's a clear sign the current administration is just about done imo. Companies/stocks want stability
2989 2018-02-05 20:42:22 God, I wish trump would stop existing so my stocks could gain value
2990 2018-02-05 20:42:20 I been trading stocks for two decades, that number was pretty scary
2991 2018-02-05 20:42:17 Hola Adolfo! Perdona, el SPY es el S&P no?
2992 2018-02-05 20:42:11 Hanes brand was up today when most other stocks were down. After all the panicking, I guess a whole lot of people needed new underwear. #Dow #StockMarket
2993 2018-02-05 20:42:06 Self Note:

Algorithms reacted faster than any human could. 

Stop-losses were hit repeatedly on 1,000 of stocks causing a mini-freak-out.

The market fall arrested once the vast majority of stop losses were hit.

Tomorrow, take your UK stock stop losses off  & manage hands-on.
2994 2018-02-05 20:42:05 Bears don't sell advertising or help big banks & brokerage houses sell stocks and mutual funds
2995 2018-02-05 20:42:01 With the DOW plumetting 1500 points today, now is a good time to invest in rope stocks #finance
2996 2018-02-05 20:41:58 Looks like the "Deep State" WhatsApp group sent out a message to sell stocks about 30 mins ago.
2997 2018-02-05 20:41:57 ahh, finished work pretty early today! time to kick back and check my stocks, i wonder how everything's doing..
2998 2018-02-05 20:41:54 Except when stocks go up it’s because of racist trump, but when they go down it’s not because of racist trump
2999 2018-02-05 20:41:53 Even the average Joe-on-the-street knows #stocks go up and down. Yet the “very good businessman” Trump in the White House doesn’t seem to grasp this concept. Oh, boy. #stocks #stockmarket #MoronInChief
3000 2018-02-05 20:41:50 State Treasurer says he is unsure whether to adopt proposal by U.S. Sen. John Kennedy to cash unclaimed stocks and bonds to help finance Comite River Diversion Canal.#lagov
3001 2018-02-05 20:41:48 Can’t help but notice Trump hasn’t wanted to talk about stocks the last few days...
3002 2018-02-05 20:41:46 #update #stocks down 942 to 25,597 Was down nearly 1500 earlier today  @KNX1070 @CBSLA @MottekOnMoney
3003 2018-02-05 20:41:41 Since Trump claimed that stocks went up because of him, does that mean that they're going down because of him?
3004 2018-02-05 20:41:37 K

And What About Stocks?
Have you Checked American Market right Now?
3005 2018-02-05 20:41:36 Stocks never go down $SPX
3006 2018-02-05 20:41:35 As one advice column I read put it "we buy everything else when it's on sale, why don't we think about stocks the same way". But I'm with you: if you have sold it, you haven't really lost any money (yet).
3007 2018-02-05 20:41:35 Stocks in shit water too.... the dollar been fallin
3008 2018-02-05 20:41:26 This is the best time to BUY the stocks you like especially when the market is down You won’t get this chance again anytime soon The market will bounce back shortly Mark my words... #InvestinU #RainyDay 
3009 2018-02-05 20:41:26 Conversations with Ray Pack are always fun.
“I’m so poor I went to the Dollar General to buy stocks. The stock market is too high”
3010 2018-02-05 20:41:25 Bet guillotine stocks are doing just fine today.
3011 2018-02-05 20:41:25 They cut off the Presidents speech for this!! Really? My husband and I love our stocks but we love our @realDonaldTrump President tons more!
3012 2018-02-05 20:41:20 If I had some cash I would jump to buy more. Some stocks are so cheap now!
3013 2018-02-05 20:41:19 good. time to buy. stocks are cheaper now.
3014 2018-02-05 20:41:13 I'm not that persuaded by casual funny dismissals of plummeting stocks because I remember watching the crash in 2008 and we barely knew what was coming
3015 2018-02-05 20:41:13 marijuana stocks are up today, is that the new safe heaven... $ACAN , $TWMJF, $MDCL....
3016 2018-02-05 20:41:12 Buy stocks with high short interest?  Big unwind ahead?
3017 2018-02-05 20:41:12 PMs are steady, if it was bad people would flock to them. This is about ETFs getting to rich, overvalued stocks. Its cash outs. 
Good time to wait, and then jump back in.
3018 2018-02-05 20:41:11 Perhaps not. Some are watching and waiting for stocks being dumped to get bargains.The Kochs are pushing this crash.Some will profit from their greed.
3019 2018-02-05 20:41:08 The Dow will go up and down which is why if you are @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP repeatedly touting how amazing you are because stocks are up is so dangerous because you have only so much control, which goes to show how empty your other achievements are... #StockMarket
3020 2018-02-05 20:41:08 Correct I was. Cause stock market going up is good. And yea stocks going down is bad but not end of world or a recession. Gotta look at it as a trend. Stocks are back to Jan levels nothing crazy yet
3021 2018-02-05 20:41:08 HAPPY having made  $$$$ 4 DIGITS GAIN $$$$ today when #DJIA dropped record 1600 points at one point today 
Bottom Fishing - Bargain Hunters - Smart Money LOAD UP great stocks at fire sale prices if you are Long Term Investors
3022 2018-02-05 20:41:08 @JimMarous  any thoughts on today's c correlation between stocks and crypto. Simultaneous bounce off lows. Seems to help legitimize crypto in my book
3023 2018-02-05 20:41:05 Has he taken a look at the stocks today?? #APPRENTICE president
3024 2018-02-05 20:41:05 Massive depletion, expanding dead zones- still too out of mind to concern enough people. The hungry that’s coming when fish stocks are gone- that is a panic I do not want to witness. Individual reduction in use of plastic is an ice-breaker everywhere. Will Europe and US catch up?
3025 2018-02-05 20:41:05 Great Job Trump! Stocks are plunging. Sad day for Billionaires. #Mnuchin
3026 2018-02-05 20:41:03 Nothing has happened to cause fear in the world, so the sell off is people cashing in their profits. You take them when you need them or you take them to reinvest. What stocks are being sold off, by whom, and how fast. The economy is strong so, I ain't worried.
3027 2018-02-05 20:41:01 Yah @realDonaldTrump ......What have you done to my stocks?
3028 2018-02-05 20:41:01 maybe stock market crashes are a result of a realization that the value that we collectively assign to stocks is completely meaningless

3031 2018-02-05 20:40:57 I love it, means stocks are going cheaper and I can by some. Those shorters must be goin crazy.
3032 2018-02-05 20:40:54 Bitcoin tanks...
The stock market falls...

It's almost as if...working...is the most reliable way to earn money instead of trying to get rich off the latest unicorn.

Listen, I get it. I have stocks too. But investments are a long game, otherwise you're just playing the lottery.
3033 2018-02-05 20:40:48 Here's my analysis: Stocks were overpriced, so the prices went down. Now pay me that Bloomberg money
3034 2018-02-05 20:40:46 Don’t look at the stock markets, watch consumer spending, GDP. Stocks will always go up and down over time

3037 2018-02-05 20:40:40 This hatred he espouses and the name calling has got to stop.  I find myself so full of hate towards him; it's not healthy but he sits at the top and is responsible.  He is a despicable person and how much longer must we be subjected to this madness! Maybe stocks will tank
3038 2018-02-05 20:40:34 Stocks are gyrating
3039 2018-02-05 20:40:32 Taking a beating today, but still up 17% this year! Time to buy - plenty of stocks bottoming out - stick with steel folks :)
3040 2018-02-05 20:40:21 it's been pretty much dropping all day.  If it  continues to drop to 20,000 in the next few days, than I would worry it might be for other reasons.  And I would be pissed cause I moved my stocks at end of year  thinking they were headed to 30K
3041 2018-02-05 20:40:17 @CNBCClosingBell  Bob Pisani just proved mad man fake news Cramer wrong  It wasnt a fake flash crash it was real sellers selling stock  He shouldnt be pumping up this over heated stock market telling people to buy stocks until this correction is over

3043 2018-02-05 20:40:14 Jeez - Seems like the slide in the market is picking up steam the last hour. Oh well... Lots of stocks on sale. Good time to jump in. #stocks #StockMarket
3044 2018-02-05 20:40:14 Signs of panic on Wall Street #stocks
3045 2018-02-05 20:40:11 People are saying it all the time, more and more, the stocks.
3046 2018-02-05 20:40:08 5- The market was due for a 'pullback' or 'correction.'
6- Also people are selling downside insurance and therefore in turn they had to short stocks to hedge.
3047 2018-02-05 20:40:05 Stocks behaving treasonously, I’m sure we can all agree.
3048 2018-02-05 20:40:03 While I totally agree with your point, I'm also not worried about the stocks. Even a minor knowledge with it tells me "It goes up AND DOWN." A big tumble has been a long time coming. Where it stops tumbling will tell us whether still it's on a positive trend or not.
3049 2018-02-05 20:40:02 Willing to tie Trump to the economy only when it fits your narrative, eh? Stocks go up/down daily.
3050 2018-02-05 20:39:59 It's really naive for individual investors to choose stocks based on "belief." The market will eat you for lunch.
3051 2018-02-05 20:39:59 Stocks are on sale today..its time to buy stocks. Let others panic
3052 2018-02-05 20:39:57 stocks say
follow the bouncing fall..
3053 2018-02-05 20:39:52 Stocks go up, stocks go down
3054 2018-02-05 20:39:52 “It’s those damn Millenials selling their coal stocks for Snap stocks”
3055 2018-02-05 20:39:51 They were running on stocks to flood into BTC ? :)
3056 2018-02-05 20:39:41 Panic? Because of Nunes? You shouldn’t drink & tweet, Sean. The Dems have no fear of Nunes. Look at Gowdy et al who refuted the memos over the weekend. No, sorry, Nunes, like you, is a liar. Facts hurt you both. And in the long run, nothing will save you. 
Hey, wanna talk stocks?
3057 2018-02-05 20:39:39 Isn't the #tax cut incentive for big players to book #profits this year by selling equities & enjoy interest rate rise? (And maybe for some corporations start #share buy backs and go private?) Especially if you think 2019 brings Dem congress & tax redo?
#stocks #equities #SellOff
3058 2018-02-05 20:39:37 You should be looking to buy, stocks are discounted
3059 2018-02-05 20:39:31 @realDonaldTrump The Dow is down more than 1,000 points. This is all you now. #stocks #news #StockMarket #StockMarketToday
3060 2018-02-05 20:39:27 I disagree with you 100%. When basically all stocks drop an additional 5% in about 10-15 minute time span then something is not right.
3061 2018-02-05 20:39:26 As soon as his fake memo came out stocks started tanking too, same day same time.
3062 2018-02-05 20:39:25 Um no that’s truthfully how u look at stocks they really are not the best option for an investment short term
3063 2018-02-05 20:39:24 Looks like it's about time to start getting greedy. Stocks on sale!
3064 2018-02-05 20:39:17 @realDonaldTrump  another amazing day for stocks donny!
3065 2018-02-05 20:39:17 Stocks down bigly. Oh well guess you can’t tout the economy any more.  #cheetoincharge

3067 2018-02-05 20:39:10 Since the stupid MEMO came out Americans have lost millions on their stocks.  Hmmmmmmm was the dems right on not releasing it.  I THINK SO!!  @Evan_McMullin @EdKrassen @JoyAnnReid @jaketapper @ananavarro @foxandfriends
3068 2018-02-05 20:39:09 How about the stocks and layoffs.  Need to brag!!
3069 2018-02-05 20:39:05 I’m the executor of my moms estate and I JUST sent in stocks to sell last week :(
3070 2018-02-05 20:39:05 @realDonaldTrump Mr. Presidemt Business Deals, please sir! The stocks! Do a business deal to save America. Please hurry. #MAGA
3071 2018-02-05 20:39:05 Any President trying to tie himself to the stock market is always a fatal mistake. When you credit yourself to the wins you also have to take credit for the loses. This is the case now as stocks plunge.
3072 2018-02-05 20:39:05 "When inflation is very low, rising inflation has a positive impact on equity valuations," - Mike Wilson, CIO at Morgan Stanley. But "rising inflation expectation may no longer be a positive for stocks, especially if markets start to think inflation is coming 'unhinged.'"
3073 2018-02-05 20:38:54 *burns 'i love stocks' t-shirt*
3074 2018-02-05 20:38:53 Stocks going up is due to his genius, stocks going down is due to Dems, Hillary, and Deep State. That’s what he knows.
3075 2018-02-05 20:38:53 The stock market correction is caused by the Clinton's. I believe people are dumping stocks on all corporations tied to the Clinton Foundation, Obama, Clinton's and others because of the memo...smart move.
3076 2018-02-05 20:38:50 stocks after the Dow dipped 1300
3077 2018-02-05 20:38:48 He's probably calling up friends to buy some stocks as we speak.
3078 2018-02-05 20:38:48 I guess the stocks falling must be Hillary's fault?, or maybe Adam Schiff's fault or anyone but humpty Trumpty's fault?. Ha ha ha ha
3079 2018-02-05 20:38:47 my stocks that were not in the sp did not go as crazy

3081 2018-02-05 20:38:43 @CharlesMBlow - Stocks Down 1000+ points in 2 days.  What did they think would happen when taxes are cut 66% for corporations (from 35% to 21%)?!? #MathForIdiotsInCongress
3082 2018-02-05 20:38:40 Right. We can't just keep seeing exponential growth as it will devalue the dollar.

I'm listening at work.. Haven't health ins stocks dropped over 11%?
3083 2018-02-05 20:38:38 Stocks down 1400 points since Friday #MondayMotivation.  What’s going on oh great One?
@realDonaldTrump
3084 2018-02-05 20:38:36 After dropping 1500 points, #Dow claws back some of its losses but we're still down 900+ points. 20 mins till closing bell. Watch CNN for more on #stocks
3085 2018-02-05 20:38:36 The Fed hiked rates...the yield curve flattened, but all rates went higher...interest rate sensitive stocks sold off..leading the indices to sell off..so risk parity funds reduced positions (sold stock and bonds)...which triggered CTA's to unwind (sell stocks, buy bonds).
3086 2018-02-05 20:38:34 U.S. stocks sold off sharply on Monday, Dow Jones erases 2018's gains and  falling back below 25,000, as a pullback from record highs deepened and investors grappled with rising bond yields and potentially firming inflation.
3087 2018-02-05 20:38:32 May this will be the bears traps buy big players
I m wating for the confirmation
1000 points corretion in nifty is not a downtrend, it is buying opportunities
But stocks market crisis happens
Then surely we will see 7800 levels in nifty then sideways then uptrend so be careful
3088 2018-02-05 20:38:31 All I know is stocks are on sale today. Great buying opportunity.
3089 2018-02-05 20:38:31 That rich, being that most of the established world thinks and says the same thing about @realDonaldTrump Did you notice the stocks today by any chance? That memo was a hoax btw
3090 2018-02-05 20:38:27 every single time there was a headline like "new record high dow!!" i was like "uhhh uh oh crash imminent" which is the main reason i didn't buy any stocks other than that i have no money and don't believe in using the stock market
3091 2018-02-05 20:38:20 Flashcrash? No. This was done on purpose to push out weak hands and run the stops. Totally rigged. Stocks will probably rebound  from here... #FAKEMARKETS
3092 2018-02-05 20:38:20 The stock market has lost over $1 trillion in value since February, crypto wasn't even worth $1 trillion. This $crypto "crash" will be hilarious sooner than everyone thinks. Central banking institutions are the real bubble that will blindside the innocent #Dow #stocks $btc
3093 2018-02-05 20:38:16 Damn. All my stocks nosediving 
3094 2018-02-05 20:38:15 There is an ulterior motive for this..Tax Windfall, market crashes, corporations buy their stocks back for pennies on a dollar instead of current market price. Koch brothers big win..will not come back til after the shutdown of the gov't 45 wants so bad..screw the people
3095 2018-02-05 20:38:12 NYT headlines “Stocks tank again, worst in 2 years” thank you @realDonaldTrump !  He takes credit for everything else
3096 2018-02-05 20:38:11 Forget about the Stocks Crashing!! Tonight on @seanhannity we will talk about Devin Nunes/President Clinton/Dossier!!!
3097 2018-02-05 20:38:02 Added more buy orders for tomorrow for a 3-6 month basis. Looks like a good opportunity to pick up discounted stocks from panicked weaker hands #FTSE #Equities #DOW #DOOM
3098 2018-02-05 20:37:58 "stocks fall as fans parade Rocky's headless corpse through Center City"
3099 2018-02-05 20:37:56 lol dude doesnt even know where his office is yet and stocks are yelling to reverse policy
3100 2018-02-05 20:37:55 The Smart money is leaving Stocks and moving into #Bitcoin!
3101 2018-02-05 20:37:54 @AliVelshi Buying stocks at Huge drop in Markets is a hell of a lot of money gains for ppl who know the Markets- Who gained the most from the 800 pt recovery, a Huge transfer of Money-
3102 2018-02-05 20:37:54 I'm sure Trump is really concerned about American consumers right now and not desperately trying to sell of stocks for his personal gain.
3103 2018-02-05 20:37:44 SHAKE IT, STOCKS
3104 2018-02-05 20:37:39 Remember this sell off today will help us as investors overtime because stocks markets cannot go straight up. Now that we have had a correction stocks will increase again. Just look at a chart of the Dow Jones average over the last 70 years. It shows a positive trend up. #stocks
3105 2018-02-05 20:37:38 If it didn't react to news that half the political establishment criminalized the FBI THEN it would be a fake BUBBLE.  Stocks react to fear and when people see this huge abuse of power it is gonna go down.
3106 2018-02-05 20:37:36 @SRuhle @AliVelshi the stock market is down like the largest drop in recent history and 45 is talking about Hilary...what the hell is wrong with him? We are in trouble! His followers don't have stocks or 401ks....lord Jesus!
3107 2018-02-05 20:37:28 Stocks tanked again on the heels of their worst week in two years, losing about 4 percent at one point during volatile trading
3108 2018-02-05 20:37:28 Glad I got out of cryptos and back in traditional stocks..wait what !? 
3109 2018-02-05 20:37:27 @TheLeadCNN Trump has fed us to the Russians ..they are dumping stocks like crazy...Mueller you have to freeze money laundering tied to Trump and his family..That was the plan.. It is Russian money
3110 2018-02-05 20:37:20 Sold my stocks with the quickness
3111 2018-02-05 20:37:16 Stocks Twerking.
3112 2018-02-05 20:37:14 stocks have tanked following the news that women will be able to consume chips
3113 2018-02-05 20:37:14 Stocks tanked again on the heels of their worst week in two years, losing about 4 percent at one point during volatile trading -- NYTimes
3114 2018-02-05 20:37:14 Awfully quiet about the stock market these past couple days. Why aren't you bragging about the new record it set today? Maybe you can start shouting "fake news" and your supporters will think stocks are still up. Or, you could release a memo saying it's a liberal conspiracy.
3115 2018-02-05 20:37:11 Unless people are in retirement and all in stocks, this is just a sideshow. Sincerely, Someone normie enough to have a 401K.
3116 2018-02-05 20:36:53 Are you doing the stocks graphic today hmmm?
3117 2018-02-05 20:36:53 Stocks tumble as Trump tells joint session of Congress "we're going to let Roy handle it, he's very good," then surge when he says "something we're looking into is bringing the stocks back, to make it bigger."
3118 2018-02-05 20:36:51 What are some good stocks that people are buying during this dip?
3119 2018-02-05 20:36:49 Stocks are on SALE !! It will go back up..it always does. This is a normal correction.
3120 2018-02-05 20:36:48 that's how we end up with baby stocks
3121 2018-02-05 20:36:47 @realDonaldTrump thanks a lot stocks it down again yay thought you were supposed to make things better for us working class folks I guess not
3122 2018-02-05 20:36:39 .market made new highs daily, weekly and monthly and not one tweet from msm..not a peep.. gave Trump no credit for stocks on the way up..it sells off 2 days and immediately they start chirping, typical selective reporting by the kings of fake news.. #hypocrisy
3123 2018-02-05 20:36:39 Shep Smith cut short the president's speech to freak out about stocks...good grief Charlie Brown...it dropped 750points, then five minutes later it jumped up 850.  Don't be such a worry wart.
3124 2018-02-05 20:36:39 Joke’s on you suckers I don’t even have enough money for stocks or a retirement
3125 2018-02-05 20:36:36 I sure hope I remembered to sell all my stocks last week.
3126 2018-02-05 20:36:29 He's no idiot ... he makes millions of dollars TALKING about stocks while we try to chance it TRADING them. I heard from a reliable source he doesn't get high on his own supply. He stays in Treasury Notes.
3127 2018-02-05 20:36:28 How key local stocks are doing

3128 2018-02-05 20:36:26 Folks, fundamentals are still SOLID as a rock.  #BUYTHEDIP ... all of these DOW losses are computer based sell of trades.  #BuytheDip now and HOLD.  This is the 5% correction we've been waiting months for.  #finance #economy #stocks
3129 2018-02-05 20:36:23 Trump to pass law making it illegal to sell stocks while he is President
3130 2018-02-05 20:36:19 Declining stocks will drag down GDP, forcing bond yields lower.
3131 2018-02-05 20:36:15 The Dow is now down over 1000 points today alone. The CNN Money headline is "Stocks are in a freefall." We need a cool, competent person with a steady hand in the top leadership position. Instead, we've got... Trump.
3132 2018-02-05 20:36:09 My guess is you have zero knowledge and zero money in stocks
3133 2018-02-05 20:36:08 Since @realDonaldTrump state of the union speech stocks have had their Worst week to HISTORY.  FEB STOCKS HAVE LOST 1,000,000,000,000 DOLLARS!!  WE ARE 5 DAYS IN.  YIPPIE.  THANKS TRUMP.  @SpeakerRyan @seanhannity @rushlimbaugh can you guys please explain to the ppl WHY??
3134 2018-02-05 20:35:56 Stock market crashed. Bitcoin crashed. The EVERYTHING bubble just popped... Time to invest or time to buy emergency food? 
#stocks #bitcoin #BTC $BTC #crash #Dow #DowJones
3135 2018-02-05 20:35:55 i for one think stocks are cool. and that they should do what they want.
3136 2018-02-05 20:35:51 Mr. President I hate to change the conversation but, for two days the stocks are down. I don't have much invested to begin and I love seeing my money grow so.....wzup? Believe me, you still have my vote.
3137 2018-02-05 20:35:47 1. Tax bill requires huge increase in gov't borrowing
2. Higher supply of bonds lowers prices and drives up interest rates
3. Bonds become more attractive investments
4. Money moves from stocks to bonds
5. Dow drops 1500 points in 2 days.

Great having a businessman in charge!
3138 2018-02-05 20:35:46 Stocks are plummeting
3139 2018-02-05 20:35:45 who the fuck is margining this shit in the first place? its 10x more volatile than stocks. Buy long, dollar cost average down, be thankful for your gains when we hit 50k on BTC.
3140 2018-02-05 20:35:44 Foreign companies are pulling out due to trumps threats... Trumps people got the call... Trump told his people... His shadow people bought the stocks...
3141 2018-02-05 20:35:43 the good news is the market learned its lesson and will never hyper inflate stocks again
3142 2018-02-05 20:35:43 my stocks!!!!
3143 2018-02-05 20:35:39 Wow $DOW just flash crashed 1300 pts along with the high-yield bond market. This definitely changes things.... Glad I'm liquid. Locked in my most profitable day ever today!  Gunna wait to see what tomorrow brings, markets are out of wack rn. #equities #stocks #markets
3144 2018-02-05 20:35:38 @realDonaldTrump #Trumptankingstocks  Trump's decision to replace Yellen combined with his attacks on law enforcement tanking stocks. Stock market under Obama never did this
3145 2018-02-05 20:35:33 It is a buying Opportunity Dom. Stocks are on sale !! The Dow always goes back up after a correction.
3146 2018-02-05 20:35:33 You know you have a real asset class when it trades I step with stocks. Bounce for coins and stocks at exact same moment
3147 2018-02-05 20:35:32 Educated Guess: #GOPTaxScammers are selling their stocks and socking their money away before Mueller comes for their sticky red hands! #TrumpStockCrash #GOPStockCrash #financialeducation #StockMarket

3154 2018-02-05 20:35:01 quem falou mesmo "stocks always take the staircase up... and the elevator down"

3155 2018-02-05 20:35:01 This is fake news. I bought all the stocks
3156 2018-02-05 20:35:01 The 50% of Americans who aren’t invested in the market are having their last laugh today. #stocks
3157 2018-02-05 20:34:52 The dow is down so that it will crash..the windfalls from this is the Corporate backers that the @GOP had slashed taxes for will buy back their stocks for pennies on the $$. This will probably happen when 45 shuts down the gov't. and he will. Why pay full price, crash buy & go on
3158 2018-02-05 20:34:51 Extremely .@leyawn voice*
Whether you think the DOW crashing is good or bad there is one thing we can all agree on. It's stocks baby!
3159 2018-02-05 20:34:49 told my boyfriend that the stock market crashed and he immediately bought more stocks
3160 2018-02-05 20:34:48 You may want to check your stocks @realDonaldTrump
3161 2018-02-05 20:34:48 All normal. Stocks were way overpriced. It’s called a bubble.  A huge sell off is to be expected after a record bull run.
3162 2018-02-05 20:34:48 Any person that has stocks knows they go up and down ! But it’s still doing great !
3163 2018-02-05 20:34:47 Stocks to crypto flippening
3164 2018-02-05 20:34:47 Thank goodness for experience & a little old-age wisdom. When I was a young, wide-eyed broker, #stockmarket days like the last two horrified me. Now, I'm thrilled to see them. #correction #stocks #investing #DowJones #NASDAQ #SP500 #retirement #personalfinance #wealth
3165 2018-02-05 20:34:43 Attention Shoppers: Did we just found out the cost of deficit financing corporate tax breaks! @realDonaldTrump #stocks
3166 2018-02-05 20:34:40 where are you now claiming how you are causing stocks to up you should be apologizing for the drop Ahole, you going to blame obama , hillary or mueller
3167 2018-02-05 20:34:30 Come on. The Dow plunged as many as 1,500 points. Should recover somewhat before closing today.

Bank stocks falling. Boeing lost 2%, Caterpillar 1%.

S&P dropped 2.7%. Nasdaq 2.3%. 

Traders worried about inflation and rising interest rates.
3168 2018-02-05 20:34:28 @realDonaldTrump Stocks getting crushed again today. I guess that is the Democrats fault, as I haven't seen you take credit for it. #Resist

3175 2018-02-05 20:34:15 It's cool, I don't have any stocks or a retirement plan and I'm already broke AF, who cares.
3176 2018-02-05 20:34:12 Jokes on you, I cashed all my stocks a month ago and put it in bitcoin. Haven't looked since, probably a billionaire at this point
3177 2018-02-05 20:34:06 Unreal.  Start with Wiki. Or something.  Or invest in other stocks that are not mining.
3178 2018-02-05 20:34:03 market made new highs daily, weekly and monthly and not one tweet..not a peep..u chose not to give Trump any credit for stocks on the way up..it sells off 2 days and immediately you start chirping, typical selective reporting  #hypocrisy
3179 2018-02-05 20:34:02 Seriously, watching the Dow Jones when you don’t own stocks is like a soap opera you’re not invested in. You don’t know why you’re watching it, but you really hope the scary clown isn’t about to kill it.
3180 2018-02-05 20:33:58 Stocks Market plummeted...still unbothered
3181 2018-02-05 20:33:52 There is no particular reason....because stocks are all made up money for the ultra rich to play games with!

tfw the horseshoe theory comes to life.
3182 2018-02-05 20:33:48 Someone probably a novice trader trying to sell his 4.2 mil shares of $CASG ...He was trying for 0.0035 now he is coming down...watching it closely ...if he gone...this thing might go for Pennyland
3183 2018-02-05 20:33:43 Gold is inversely correlated to confidence but a 2%-3% selloff in stocks isn't exactly a crash. I'd say gold is acting within expectations.
3184 2018-02-05 20:33:39 Cramer is literally shit talking people into buying stocks like some World Star video
3185 2018-02-05 20:33:39 Every single one of my stocks has dropped by at least 5% today
3186 2018-02-05 20:33:36 Trump is still going to look like a fool for posting all those tweets about how wonderful stocks were doing. Should've kept quiet about it, since he surely knows about the volatility of the stock market.
3187 2018-02-05 20:33:31 Markets : Age of excessive speculation: The machines are not infallibile just as humans are not.  Last week was a quite week for cotton in news but ICE traded 41.388 Million bales in F/O . Whether its stocks or commodities the machines do not allways work well.
3188 2018-02-05 20:33:30 stocks fall as light poles ripped down by celebrating Eagles fans turned out to have been connected to important Verizon data cables?
3189 2018-02-05 20:33:29 S&P 500: 492 stocks down, just 16 are higher. The index is down 71 points (-2.6%)

3191 2018-02-05 20:33:25 You live in a fantasy world.  Stocks are down and you are concerned.  Simple economics. Guess you flunked that course. Most unintelligible President ever if you do not understand the market.  Go ask your treasury secretary since he worked for investment banking

3197 2018-02-05 20:33:08 The Feds job is to moderate inflation. When you cut taxes in a growing economy it can lead to inflation so guess what the Fed will do? They will raise interest rates. This is why stocks are dropping.
3198 2018-02-05 20:33:08 Can you provide a link that works?  Thanks,.
3199 2018-02-05 20:33:07 So glad I didn't buy any stocks this morning.

3204 2018-02-05 20:32:56 I knew this wouldn't end well when the computer workstations at my local public library were taken over by 2-digit-IQ schmucks day-trading penny stocks and cryptocurrencies. #MoneyHeaven

3211 2018-02-05 20:32:42 People not understanding stocks smh.

"Look drumpf! Stocks fall 1000 points! Lol drumpf is over!"

Let me point out that the stock market jumped from 17,000 to 26,000. An all time high! And believe me, it will bounce once again!
3212 2018-02-05 20:32:42 I think it's hilareous how stocks have ben climbing for weeks and we hear very little....it bumps down a bit and it's apocalyptic. Relax people....
3213 2018-02-05 20:32:38 Leaving aside the sad political point-scoring going on over a stock market correction, the human psychology is amazing. People freak out only when stocks go down. Sometimes the time to be alarmed is when they go up in a straight line. Today a bunch of assets just went on sale
3214 2018-02-05 20:32:37 Must be good time to buy Infrastructure stocks such as Caterpillar based on upcoming stimulus spending. However, tech stocks may take a beating based on the biased crookery they engage in such as twitter. #JustDumpThisStock
3215 2018-02-05 20:32:36 I don't keep money in stocks for this reason here. I'm only 20 years away from retirement so I'm not putting anything other than my 401k at risk of a market change like this. For short-term Investments I get where those people would be freaking but it'll be okay
3216 2018-02-05 20:32:32 3% is an epic collapse?

Actually check your stock market history, it is very normal.  Happens every year.

So you're an idiot.  Lucky for you your tweet will be loved by a bunch of people who never traded stocks a day in their life.
3217 2018-02-05 20:32:29 #StockMarket #TimeToBuy Going to buy some stocks today.
3218 2018-02-05 20:32:29 Brb, mortgaging my kidneys to buy stocks at same price as two months ago.
3219 2018-02-05 20:32:29 selling stocks to buy bonds with increased interest rates, it will level out and work its way back up again ;)
3220 2018-02-05 20:32:28 ok everyone calm down. keep an eye on any stocks you like. when you are comfortable buy them.

3222 2018-02-05 20:32:23 I'd rule that our fixation on a price-weighted index of 30 stocks is equivalent to a "bad use of polling." But yes, S&P500 shit the bed, as well.

3226 2018-02-05 20:32:16 $TLT has a huge reversal green candle signaling short-term peak in rates for now. Stocks and cryptos also  bottomed and reversing higher together!
3227 2018-02-05 20:32:12 That's only trivially true. You have wealth in different asset classes. Stocks are one such class. If the value of an asset class decreases, your wealth immediately decreases as well.
3228 2018-02-05 20:32:11 Maybe bitcoin will come back up now that stocks are down 
3229 2018-02-05 20:32:10 All due respect to you, bullshit. This is a message to the @realDonaldTrump Whitehouse to back off?  Very curious timing indeed. #MAGA #TrumpTrain2020 #StockMarket #stocks #Stock #MuellerTime
3230 2018-02-05 20:32:09 The market crashing means ZIIIIIP to me. Zip. Having universal healthcare to fix me and making sure my classmates don’t get deported by American Nazis is more important to me than a bunch of stocks I don’t own. 
3231 2018-02-05 20:32:05 Stocks are going down you complete utter idiot because companies are making capital infrastructure investments, paying employees more and taking on more risk.
See investments don't always return value.
3232 2018-02-05 20:32:05 WHERE THE FUCK AM I GONNA GET MY STOCKS NOW??
3233 2018-02-05 20:32:00 Do I capitulation sell all my stocks to buy bitcoin?

Or, 

Do I capitulation sell all my bitcoins to buy stocks?
3234 2018-02-05 20:31:59 Call me crazy, but this where I'd invest in the stocks if I could! lol I only watch the DOW on FOX Business! lol
3235 2018-02-05 20:31:58 Hey, look who cares about stocks again. Welcome back, where have you been?
3236 2018-02-05 20:31:57 indeed! this looks like basic panic--dump stocks and buy bonds
3237 2018-02-05 20:31:57 what is going on with the stocks
3238 2018-02-05 20:31:54 we saw periods of elevated volatility in the 90s as stocks continued to rally for years. so don't let anyone tell you otherwise $VIX $SPX $DJIA $QQQ
3239 2018-02-05 20:31:52 Who could have known that stocks go down? Nobody knew!
3240 2018-02-05 20:31:52 The serious carnage was in the 30 Dow stocks.  Flash crashes around 3:10 ET in many of the components.
3241 2018-02-05 20:31:51 I would buy stocks right NOW!
3242 2018-02-05 20:31:46 President's Day sale for stocks.

#Hoff #Kopeesh
3243 2018-02-05 20:31:45 Waiting for Trump or @presssec to claim the stocks that caused the market to crater were companies who refused to give employees a $1000 bogus, err I mean bonus.
3244 2018-02-05 20:31:45 The Trump economy- everybody loses. Wages stagnate and stocks fall.
3245 2018-02-05 20:31:45 These boom times will never end! By jingo, I'm going to buy more stocks tomorrow! It'll be the bee's knees! The cat's pajamas! Absolutely hotsy-totsy! 

What's the worst that could happen?
3246 2018-02-05 20:31:42 Flight to safety out of stocks into #Bitcoin
3247 2018-02-05 20:31:38 I was looking to buy some stocks today,but not sure when this drop will stop,or at least calm down
3248 2018-02-05 20:31:35 buy low, sell high, plan on at least 10 years (more is better) and as you get older/near retirement, sell off stocks to reduce risk.
3249 2018-02-05 20:31:32 Coles theme song ringing in my head today "Dow Dow, stocks are dow(n)"
3250 2018-02-05 20:31:28 Liberal media is delighted with the lower stocks and wish they had plunged more. Savaged bastards
3251 2018-02-05 20:31:27 i put some money into stocks the last couple weeks cause i thought "hey i should be a real-ass adult"
3252 2018-02-05 20:31:25 This is the definition of market silliness... I couldn't buy enough off the lows today of the financials and some good dividend stocks...

3254 2018-02-05 20:31:20 So Trump holds another 'record' - worst single-day losses EVER for Dow Jones! Way to go MAGA. I hope it hurts his stocks as much at it hurts the 95% rest of us who work hard to get ahead.
3255 2018-02-05 20:31:18 Stocks are down and this girl gonna say "I guess winter in a slow time for stocks" ... hunnnny whattt? Lol.
3256 2018-02-05 20:31:18 Federal Reserve put more air into the bubble #Stocks

3259 2018-02-05 20:31:06 Except when stocks go up it’s because of trump, but when they go down it’s not because of trump
3260 2018-02-05 20:31:06 So how does one go about buying stocks?
3261 2018-02-05 20:31:05 Bro all stocks went down wtf lol
3262 2018-02-05 20:31:02 Why isn't Twitter trending the Dow? Its own stocks and shares influencing what it decides to trend?
3263 2018-02-05 20:31:01 Now at half from lower levels...
Who's buying cheap?
Energy stocks? 
Sorry, I don't trust "these people"!

3266 2018-02-05 20:30:55 Ohhh I'm losing so much money today. I wish I had some cash available to buy some of these stocks on sale.

3268 2018-02-05 20:30:47 @seanhannity  Does @FoxNews not see that Shephard Smith is a Democrat pundit? He is so disingenuous to President Trump. I change channel when he appears. Today, that idiot disrupted Trump’s speech in Ohio to yap on stocks that we all clearly see and know about.
3269 2018-02-05 20:30:46 Now we will see money will flow to the crypto market. - from all stocks exchanges. @CoinMarketCap

3271 2018-02-05 20:30:45 Point View’s John Petrides says look at S&P 500 for more accurate market assessment. Dow is being brought down by stocks with huge caps. #CheddarLive
3272 2018-02-05 20:30:43 People still haven’t learned! Trump will pivot and blame the Fed for tightening too much. Since when has he had a problem shifting blame for things? Also, much of his base will cheer a crash as it impacts the elite and they own little/no stocks
3273 2018-02-05 20:30:42 Show proof of what you are saying otherwise you are lying about the company!
3274 2018-02-05 20:30:42 I've got it: The current political debate *on a daily basis* is what market commentary is like on days when stocks fall 2%. Pundits on the left are the bears, pundits on the right are the bulls.

3276 2018-02-05 20:30:29 Jim is the quick crash caused by how much funds are in ETF's? As people sell their ETF's don't they have to sell stocks regardless what the fundamentals are.
3277 2018-02-05 20:30:29 Stocks down. Trump will need a distraction. Start digging a bunker now? Asking for a nervous friend on the West Coast.
3278 2018-02-05 20:30:28 All my stocks on robinhood are in the red
3279 2018-02-05 20:30:27 If 10-year yields can manage to get back down below 2.65% the equity selloff will probably stop but until then, look out below...

3281 2018-02-05 20:30:22 My stocks are melting.
3282 2018-02-05 20:30:21 This is a great time to buy stocks.

3292 2018-02-05 20:29:59 Took a 7% two day down move for the credit market to take stocks somewhat seriously
3293 2018-02-05 20:29:58 The stocks have taken a battering but the crytpo even more.
3294 2018-02-05 20:29:56 The Plunge Protection Team just stepped in.  $DJIA

3295 2018-02-05 20:29:55 Markets are running hot.

I sold out most of mine last week, not because of any great intuition just have a bigger investment to make away from stocks
3296 2018-02-05 20:29:55 Here's some comfort. No matter how bad the Leafs are doing, they're probably not doing as badly as your stocks.
3297 2018-02-05 20:29:52 Nah stocks are just on sale now!  Buy buy buy
3298 2018-02-05 20:29:52 Why is your stock crashing?

Dems: Trump's economic policies are terrible for the economy.
GOP: Deep state is selling off stocks to crash market and ruin Trump's speech.
Normal People: lol "stocks" Yeah, I can afford those.
3299 2018-02-05 20:29:41 Most of us aren’t panicking about the stocks. Most are only paying attention bc the man in the White House has made it sound like the stocks doing well means regular Americans are doing well

3301 2018-02-05 20:29:30 *pinching nose* my stocks!
3302 2018-02-05 20:29:30 I'm a long term trader.  I've picked up several stocks.  Have buy orders in for more.  This is a GREAT DAY for me!!!! 
3303 2018-02-05 20:29:28 Today's stock action has no political meaning at all.  Stocks were frothy - this happens.
3304 2018-02-05 20:29:22 Happy to report that there is a sale on stocks at the moment. Get em while supplies last.

3311 2018-02-05 20:29:12 $DJI As the DOW & stock market tumbles, you better believe people in stocks will take profits after such a bull run and look to #crypto which is down > 60% . Also I expect SEC outcomes to be positive. #buyitup $6700 was it. $BTC $ETH $NEO
3312 2018-02-05 20:29:07 I'm hella mad the stock market finna crash and I don't have not enough savings to buy up stocks while they're at its lowest prices..

3314 2018-02-05 20:29:05 The greedy that have the most money to invest in stocks are cashing out because they fear the unstable Trump and his corrupt party.
3315 2018-02-05 20:29:04 Interest rates will be going up up up! Time to buy some cheap”er” stocks now!
3316 2018-02-05 20:28:59 Post crash/surge commentary is the best. It makes Harold Reynolds' baseball analysis look like a peer-reviewed paper on astrophysics. "Stocks down on fears of [stuff we're totally parroting and/or completely pulling out of our rear ends]"

3320 2018-02-05 20:28:56 People are talking about crypto like scam. They should check the stocks these days. Can you consider those as scam as well?! Its very simple.. what goes up quickly will drop quickly as well. Eventually the good coins will survive and this year we will hit 2 trillion marketcap
3321 2018-02-05 20:28:50 The stock market is tanking but most MAGA folks don’t have stocks. So this won’t affect them.
3322 2018-02-05 20:28:40 We are going to have to agree to disagree on this.  When the stock market crashes, people lose jobs, money, and retirement savings.  Rich people use it as a write-off against their huge earnings.  Most people's pensions are managed in stocks.

3326 2018-02-05 20:28:36 Dow falls more than 1,500 points. However, the long term investment nature of real estate makes CRE less volatile than stocks. There have been prior corrections this cycle and real estate has performed reasonably well through all of them. @CushWakeUS

The Dow fell 1,599 points this afternoon and is now down 800 points. Stocks are now nearly flat for the year. Fears about rising inflation and interest rates stopped the market in its tracks over the last two days.

3345 2018-02-05 20:28:03 The thing about the stock market, is that it's supposed to go up and down right? It's why stocks are a *long term* investment. If you're risk averse or near retirement, don't play the stock market.

3349 2018-02-05 20:27:52 No. I'd say it's also from some weak earnings hurting some sectors, (e.g. amazon threatening healthcare stocks), the Wells ruling,Algos exacerbating the moves down. mkt had been expecting a Goldilocks scenarios of benign rates, low inflation, stable earnings, and no other shocks
3350 2018-02-05 20:27:50 Anyone think the stock rout is related?

3353 2018-02-05 20:27:43 The market going up and down isn't linked to anything than how confident a bunch of hedge and mutual funds feel about their future dividend payments on the stocks they hold.

This is a loss of gains from Jan 2018...Get your facts right dude.
This is an auto correction on those taking winnings and getting rid of over valued stocks.
3362 2018-02-05 20:27:28 those 30 stocks are like a black hole then pulling everything around in down

3364 2018-02-05 20:27:24 My current (random) new hobby is to learn more about stocks and trading with the @Investopedia Stock Simulator. Let's just say that it looks like it's a good thing that I'm using play money... :-)
3365 2018-02-05 20:27:22 Statistically, 55% of Americans own stocks.

And selling stocks at higher prices means more capital gains tax revenue to be used for all sorts of good purposes .

Only reason for anyone to be happy is IF you’re short.  Or underinvested, looking for a cheaper entry point
3366 2018-02-05 20:27:21 The Memo. The Memo. Watch the GOP blame. Blame. Blame. I afix it to @Dodge for their appropriation and catharsis humping but #TrumpTrain base is unaffected and saying, 'stocks? Like 4 soup?'
3367 2018-02-05 20:27:20 Stock invester are selling off stocks n pocketing the profits. And who wouldn't?  I purchased 3 bitcoin when price was $146. Cant say how much I made from sale last week. Yuge profit.

3372 2018-02-05 20:27:09 Hey why don't you talk about the stocks plummeting again today ?
3373 2018-02-05 20:27:06 The Smart money is exiting stocks to prop up #Bitcoin
3374 2018-02-05 20:27:06 stocks are down and Bitcoin is below 7,000
3375 2018-02-05 20:26:59 Makes stocks more affordable for coal miners. SO MUCH WINNING!!!
3376 2018-02-05 20:26:57 yeah i own stocks but i got some other options
3377 2018-02-05 20:26:57 When stocks rallied @realDonaldTrump took the credit. Will he do the same for the drop?
3378 2018-02-05 20:26:57 I know, my pot stocks are the only ones not hit so hard
3379 2018-02-05 20:26:56 thinking about selling my shares in Logan Paul LLC and FidgetSpinner GmbH so i can buy some DOW stocks. also the news app is broken on my phone and i can't open it. thoughts? #investing #Entrepreneur
3380 2018-02-05 20:26:56 In history @realDonaldTrump will@be known as the 666 of stocks
3381 2018-02-05 20:26:56 Um...it's almost like you're forgetting the other lesson: Stocks also go back up again.
3382 2018-02-05 20:26:55 i'm waiting for the tweet where he says how great the economy is. Might need to reinvest that 1.50 into penny stocks instead of Costco membership.
3383 2018-02-05 20:26:55 Can't wait to see the stocks after his impeachment
3384 2018-02-05 20:26:55 @FoxNews Put @realDonaldTrump back on n get Shep off You can talk about the stocks on @FoxBusiness n later We want to see our @POTUS speak!! #AmericaFirst
3385 2018-02-05 20:26:53 when i think about average americans like joe the plumber, i think about the way they like to check the stock market hourly and then buy or sell their 'stocks'
3386 2018-02-05 20:26:50 1) "I'm going to buy hamburgers the rest of my life. When hamburgers go down in price, we sing the Hallelujah Chorus in the Buffett household. When hamburgers go up in price, we weep. For most people, it’s the same with everything in life they will be buying — except stocks
3387 2018-02-05 20:26:50 Has the Federal Reserve announced its emergency purchases of stocks yet?
3388 2018-02-05 20:26:50 The stock market dropping 1500 points was great for buying certain stocks. Already back to -900. This was a pointless drop
3389 2018-02-05 20:26:48 I've been waiting for the stocks to go down so I could buy. I know it's weird, but I got a little frustrated with all this up, up, up market. You need both.
3390 2018-02-05 20:26:44 obama screwed me out of so much money the last 8 years, I had none to give into this round. #MAGA #StockMarket #stocks #TrumpTrain2020
3391 2018-02-05 20:26:43 Thanks Trump. Your tax scam is working beautifully. The stocks are dropping so all these corporations can by their stock back cheaply. Selling high, buying low.
3392 2018-02-05 20:26:41 This one time these dudes made a blindfolded chimp choose stocks by throwing darts at a wall. Kinda feels like they tried the same thing when they made The Cloverfield Paradox
3393 2018-02-05 20:26:40 Wonder if it has anything to do with the corporations buying back their stocks with their found tax money.
3394 2018-02-05 20:26:39 Anyway, friends, here's some investment advice (which I try to avoid giving):

This can be a good opportunity to rebalance. But if you were holding stocks–and you don't need them for at least 10 years because why were you holding stocks if you did–selling into cash *now* is bad.
3395 2018-02-05 20:26:38 Since Trump has been taking credit for the rising markets, would he now take responsibility for the falling stocks?
3396 2018-02-05 20:26:38 Yeah so gotta look at the big pic here.  Don't panic, if you don't need the money today from your stocks, you haven't lost a dime today.
3397 2018-02-05 20:26:34 The first rule is always have cash available if you invest in stocks. This will be a buying opportunity shortly.
3398 2018-02-05 20:26:31 No better time for a market crash than during Black Future Month. So open you a brokerage account, throw in 100+ dollars, and wait. You’ll want some buying power once these stocks start their rebound. #BlackWealth #BestWealth
3399 2018-02-05 20:26:25 Wow the Dow just plunged today... not too happy about that... my stocks have lost a lot of value... hope things get better... #DowJones #StockMarket
3400 2018-02-05 20:26:24 In an extremely Murray Hill Brother Jimmy’s finance bro voice: how about these stocks
3401 2018-02-05 20:26:23 Here we go...the stock market is reacting to the the economic shift!  Decisions create long term impacts! Make sure you understand  the reprecussions!  #markets #stocks
3402 2018-02-05 20:26:22 It's really gonna affect all the transactions that use stocks as a currency huh
3403 2018-02-05 20:26:20 Largest intraday point drop for the $DIA in history#marketmeltdown #crash #stocks
3404 2018-02-05 20:26:13 Just remember the DOW is NOT the economy. We've actually needed higher interest rates for a long time. We have been artificially keeping them low. In a good economy you should be able to invest in either stocks or bonds and still make a decent return.
3405 2018-02-05 20:26:13 Paul Ryan says, "It's a great time to buy penny stocks!"  Woohoo!
3406 2018-02-05 20:26:10 #DOW plunges 1000 points, hurrah...or not?!..i don't own stocks
3407 2018-02-05 20:26:07 Stocks: Dow down 800.
Volatility: Huge. Dow was down 1,500 minutes ago.
Bonds: 10-year yield is way down (below 2.76%) after a relentless rise over the past month.
3408 2018-02-05 20:26:06 .@realDonaldTrump fyi see below!

RT @felixsalmon: Also, PLEASE stop looking at the Dow. It's 30 stocks, and it's not even an index. People love quoting it because the numbers are big. Come on, surely we're more grown-up than that.
3409 2018-02-05 20:26:05 I'm gonna buy me some stocks $SPY $LRCX
3410 2018-02-05 20:26:02 ■CNN速報(米版)：Stocks are on a roller-coaster. Here's the Dow Jones ticker
3411 2018-02-05 20:25:56 Whoever was stupid enough to buy stocks on Joe Kiernan @JoeSquawk non stop Trump pump job should probably sue him now and get him to restore their account balances. Then may be he'll learn to be more responsible with his gab.
3412 2018-02-05 20:25:54 I was making a joke where you said that the stock market taking a 1500 point hit was an opportunity to buy stocks but where I just wanted to buy video games

IDK they can't all be winners 
3413 2018-02-05 20:25:53 Stocks are pretty low, may be a good time to get that tech fund you’ve been eyeing
3414 2018-02-05 20:25:48 Tonight on Hannity: How the Clinton’s, Obama’s, DNC and the FBI conspired to have Democrats sell off their stocks to embarass the President for political gain.
3415 2018-02-05 20:25:44 @ShepNewsTeam “stolen” @TeamCavuto show. He spoke around 30 minutes for #Stocks, #Dow etc even the headlines are full of news ?!...only to “ignore” @realDonaldTrump Wining Agenda. Sorry #NeilCavuto you have te speak full hour for #Weather, #PuppiesSuperboll & #Eagles
3416 2018-02-05 20:25:44 bitcoin: im having a bad day

stocks: my life rules bro ohhhh shiiitttt wait what oh no
3417 2018-02-05 20:25:42 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  HEY GUYS!! The Dow is down 1,400 so far today! Is that #MAGA? I am sure that's not great. You know, having stocks down over 2,000 points in two days. WORST drop in eight years. Since you took credit for the up swings, this on you too, right?
3418 2018-02-05 20:25:42 Dotard, Dotard, you are sooo much dumber than any other "president" ever! Fox News tells you pretty lies.Did they tell you that your stupidy is causing stocks to drop to almost record lows? #LoserTrump
3419 2018-02-05 20:25:42 President Trump won’t give in! We knew the stocks would eventually make a correction. The stocks can’t stay a bull market forever. The market falling after a huge surge is normally what happens.

I’m sure it had help from Soros and Rothschild though!
3420 2018-02-05 20:25:41 If you’re a smart investor and have cash, you’re buying quality stocks at 3-5% discounts right now
3421 2018-02-05 20:25:40 The stock market is not the economy, the economy is doing amazingly.  There are several reasons for the drop, partly the uncertainty of government during investigations, partly the Fed President retiring, mostly shorting stocks and companies taking profit after huge runup.
3422 2018-02-05 20:25:39 Wow, a lotta red today!! Some good stocks on sale today!!
3423 2018-02-05 20:25:38 Who cares? Only 20% of people own stocks. The rich are still rich, the rest are still struggling regardless of the market!
3424 2018-02-05 20:25:38 Soros selling off all his stocks?
3425 2018-02-05 20:25:34 If you're looking at the long term, now is a good time to buy some stocks that you've been eying but thought they were a bit pricey...
3426 2018-02-05 20:25:33 Stock Markets sell off today is nerve racking but try not to panic. Remember these markets will settle. If you need the money you still have profits to sell.  If have cash buy stocks on you stock wish list. #stocks
3427 2018-02-05 20:25:33 How’s your stocks today bruh?
3428 2018-02-05 20:25:32 @VelshiRuhle Great advice Stephanie. My mom invested in stocks for years. Always long term investments. She gave the same advice. This from a career accountant born in the depression who raised 5 kids as single mom in 50'-80's
3429 2018-02-05 20:25:30 @RedDogT3 @carlquintanilla @canuck2usa @The_Real_Fly Bitcoin bounced right off 6400 n so did Stocks!!!
3430 2018-02-05 20:25:30 Heh, thanks. I'm not worried because I have no stocks, bonds, retirement funds, or anything else. A bad economy affects me but not a stock market fall.
3431 2018-02-05 20:25:30 I always knew it was too risky for him to take credit for the Stocks market. Because now he’s tied himself to downfall which isn’t necessarily his fault.
3432 2018-02-05 20:25:27 Unless you’re retiring tomorrow and you have your retirement accounts in stocks, relax.
3433 2018-02-05 20:25:26 Look for US stocks to bounce after the selling halts at about a 5% healthy pullback.
3434 2018-02-05 20:25:25 I played totally safe,stock in long established co who produce a product. Asian-Pacific funds could pay off in long run but why not solid,old fashioned stocks. ETFs,mutuals no use for. Smacks of schemes in the 20s.
3435 2018-02-05 20:25:18 Then get it right: people care about what happens to stocks, not what stocks do.
3436 2018-02-05 20:25:14 Wonder where our Very Stable Genus will 'hang his hat" now that the market has crashed! #Wall Street #Crash #Stocks
3437 2018-02-05 20:25:14 Have you ever owned stocks? 
Google the words market corrections...learn something.

3440 2018-02-05 20:25:13 Is the coverage of the stocks overturning your coverage Phil?
3441 2018-02-05 20:25:07 Time for the Federal Reserve to announce limitless purchases of stocks all across Dow, Nasdaq and S&P. The rally must go on.
3442 2018-02-05 20:25:06 55% of my 401k is in domestic stocks. Hope this is just a correction and not a crash.
3443 2018-02-05 20:25:04 $MSFT $APPL these stocks were standouts this morning in a weak market but panic has hit them too.  AAPL in the 150's and MSFT in the 80's are great buys. Buy quality stocks when everything is getting sold.
3444 2018-02-05 20:24:56 Tonight on Hannity: How the Clinton’s, Obama’s, DNC and the FBI conspired to have Democrats well off their stocks to embarass the President for political gain.
3445 2018-02-05 20:24:55 STOCKS DOWN 1500 POINTS,,YOU JUST LOST YOUR WEALTH.
3446 2018-02-05 20:24:54 I put my retirement into sports gambling instead of stocks as I actually know something about sports instead of business...
3447 2018-02-05 20:24:51 Trump speaks & Stocks Crash!
3448 2018-02-05 20:24:50 The parallels between 1928 and 2018 is uncanny. New disruptive tech eg. radio stocks open to manipulation and controlled by a few & understood by fewer. Today blockchain & ability to manipulate prices. Roller coaster for the next 12/18 months.
3449 2018-02-05 20:24:44 time to buy some solar and geothermal stocks

3451 2018-02-05 20:24:40 Lots of tech stocks moving around.
3452 2018-02-05 20:24:39 The stocks are going up,its Obama’s economy. It’s going down it’s Trumps economy said every libtard ever.
3453 2018-02-05 20:24:38 The scramble for bargain stocks is on.
3454 2018-02-05 20:24:38 Luckily I didn't spend my extra $1.50 a week from the tax cut on any new stocks.
3455 2018-02-05 20:24:35 Stocks also go down. #DowJones
3456 2018-02-05 20:24:35 @realDonaldTrump STOCKS PLUNGE 800 -1,000 + POINTS !!! OH TOP 20 % OWN STOCK THAT IS PLUNGES ! GAINS ARE GONE NOW ! GOING TO TAKE CREDIT FOR PLUNGE ?

3460 2018-02-05 20:24:11 As volatility surges and #stocks swing hundreds of points, and the #DJIA is down about 1000 pts I'd like to be the first to say:

3461 2018-02-05 20:24:11 Hoping it plunges to zero and people give up on the concept of stocks, money, and other spooks.
3462 2018-02-05 20:24:09 how are the stocks looking today boys
3463 2018-02-05 20:24:07 You, dumb: I can tell you that stocks falling will...uh...change some things...while other things...um...remain...similar...

Me, brilliant economist: I can tell you that things changing will...uh...make some stocks rise...while other stocks...um...fall...

3467 2018-02-05 20:24:01 Isn't a short term dollar spike to be expected if people panic out of stocks?
3468 2018-02-05 20:24:01 Dow drops 1,000 points as stocks fall; Wells Fargo plunges
3469 2018-02-05 20:23:57 A few months back, they asked me if I wanted to change up my portfolio to take advantage of some higher risk stocks because the market was doing so well.

"NOPE!"
3470 2018-02-05 20:23:51 Billionaires find only an extra $1.5 million in weekly paycheck, not enough to buy a Costco.  Depressed.  Sell stocks.
3471 2018-02-05 20:23:51 is that stocks
3472 2018-02-05 20:23:48 USA traders are selling off stocks to buy #Bitcoin now that its price has dropped
3473 2018-02-05 20:23:46 I had a customer call in yesterday and claim my companies stock was dropping because of our service which is why he preferred [insert rival company name here] was doing better.
I apologized for his poor experience and suggested he check their stocks (which fell worse than ours)
3474 2018-02-05 20:23:44 Last week the stock market boom was because of Obama's policies,this weeks decline in stocks is Trump's fault. More proof that liberals like Shep the Shelp are idiots
3475 2018-02-05 20:23:44 Fuck your stocks. 

They're taking away healthcare, ripping families apart, promoting private prisons, attacking our education system, ravaging our public lands, destroying the environment, threatening nuclear war. 

Wall Street doesn't deserve to make a cent until this is fixed.
3476 2018-02-05 20:23:42 Love that @ShepNewsTeam cut away from Trump speech to cover the spiraling #DowJones #stocks #foxnews
3477 2018-02-05 20:23:42 Exactly Jacob. Wealthy people will do this to get people to sell off and rake up their stocks for next to nothing. Makes me sick how the filthy rich do this to the common people.
3478 2018-02-05 20:23:37 So I know the DOW is down 900 right now but it was 1500 a few minutes avo. So technically that means it's up 600 #GlassHalfFull #Stocks
3479 2018-02-05 20:23:36 Lmao can reporters ask him if he is going to take blame for the stocks going down? We need reporters to ask questions we the people wanna ask. Like why are you such a lier, why are you so racist. The key is to tell him he is not to ask if he is
3480 2018-02-05 20:23:34 Dow drops 1,000 points as stocks fall; Wells Fargo plunges
3481 2018-02-05 20:23:34 Start a thread and explain like to see your take. I expected this best time to buy more stocks and once the market settles will see it soar again.
3482 2018-02-05 20:23:32 The rich corporations got their tax break, now they’re cashing in. Individual investors flooding the market. Stock market crash. Small investors go bankrupt. Big corporations buy back their stocks for pennies on the dollar! #TaxScam #FakePresident #Impeach45
3483 2018-02-05 20:23:31 you can always try ,, wow what is going on people are just dumping stocks
3484 2018-02-05 20:23:30 Yes, you’re correct.  We needed the new ‘level’ on the stick.  
I’ve been able to get into some stocks I’ve been eyeing.

3486 2018-02-05 20:23:24 .@realDonaldTrump Look what you did to my #401k today! You tried to take all the credit when the market was rising. Are you going to now accept all the blame as it tanks? #hypocrite #StockMarket #stocks #DowJones

3490 2018-02-05 20:23:15 Dow drops 1,000 points as stocks fall; Wells Fargo plunges.
3491 2018-02-05 20:23:13 I'm so upset... my stocks sky rocketed a couple days ago, and I didn't even check it. Look at them today and it dropped a dumb amount.
3492 2018-02-05 20:23:13 stocks seem low, might be a good time to buy if you've got some extra money you made recently in the stock market
3493 2018-02-05 20:23:10 It’s a great day to buy stocks!
3494 2018-02-05 20:23:06 Market correction are not pretty; but necessary! I’d like to see 23500 on the DOW at the end of the quarter. Make a list of the stocks you want to buy at a good price and  be patient!
3495 2018-02-05 20:23:03 The stocks are literally dropping right now tf
3496 2018-02-05 20:23:03 The movers and shakers who rush to remind people that “the dow is not the economy” sound like they have stocks and are trying to help maintain consumer confidence
3497 2018-02-05 20:23:03 I think the stocks were overdue for a correction as well. I do think BTC will be over 20k by end of the year again, but who knows. Either way, I was in BTC under 2k, took my initial investments out at 18k, so no losses here. My stocks on the other hand, woof.
3498 2018-02-05 20:23:02 Same, I never put in more than I am willing to lose on any investment. Stocks or Cryptos. And I refuse to sell at a loss
3499 2018-02-05 20:23:01 They made a great point on Fox Biz too.  A lot of people set triggers to sell on stocks, so I would not be surprised if a lot of these sells were just auto triggered.
3500 2018-02-05 20:23:00 Experts say to ignore. i agree and i have no stocks!
3501 2018-02-05 20:22:59 The positive statements justifying Trumpism when the Dow was rocketing up should be met with as much skepticism as inevitable negative statements about Trumpism when the market goes down. Stocks are fickle beasts that resist political influence.
3502 2018-02-05 20:22:59 Time to sell my stocks in bad judgement.
3503 2018-02-05 20:22:56 Stay away from weed stocks because they are based on speculation and suckers bet. Weed smokers are going to grow there own or buy where they usually buy in private no headaches and no red tape or taxes..  Colorado the price has dropped considerably 50 dollars for 28 grams.
3504 2018-02-05 20:22:56 I trust @FoxBusiness they do a better job and even show that even PM and Gold is not up....so this is a batch of people taking winnings, like I did last week. This is a clean out of overvalued stocks and will bring things back to sanity.
3505 2018-02-05 20:22:53 @realDonaldTrump   With U.S. stocks down sharply -- at one point the Dow was down 1500+ points or 6% today, and other markets down 4% or more as well -- this is called panic selling. It's the Big Trump Panic of 2018.
3506 2018-02-05 20:22:53 Just picked up some XIV. Didn't lose much at all in this period where we had a correction cuz most of my money wasn't in stocks that tanked.
3507 2018-02-05 20:22:52 #stocks #stockmarket #potus #cnn DOW down 1,000 points today. Businessmen have finally woken up to the kind of country we will have after with an insane 10 year-old running it.
3508 2018-02-05 20:22:51 Why not trump taking credit stocks falling?
3509 2018-02-05 20:22:46 #SPY Wow, up 40 handles from low a few minutes ago. This is (almost) all technical selling from an overbought situation -- end of day rally a week ago friday was silly! But there are no big negatives in the market today. Earnings good, no geopolitical scares. Buy stocks, sell vix
3510 2018-02-05 20:22:45 stocks down bigly as well not just a crypto thing!
3511 2018-02-05 20:22:45 If nothing else, this is your time to buy stocks. #Wealthconsciousness
3512 2018-02-05 20:22:44 I think when the stocks will not be so attractive, here will come the money.
3513 2018-02-05 20:22:44 U.S. stocks plunged for a second straight session, with the #DowJones Industrial Average dropping more than 1,400 points and the S&P 500 Index enduring its steepest single-day decline since August 2015, erasing its gains for the yearhttps://www.cnbc.com/.
3514 2018-02-05 20:22:41 Market update! This just in: stocks can also go down! That is all.
3515 2018-02-05 20:22:40 and y'all want to know why, even after seeing Trading Places over 500x in my life, I still don't understand how stocks work, i.e. stock market falls 666 points Friday, 1500 today, and yet y'all will  still put your money in them.
3516 2018-02-05 20:22:37 While we’re in stocks, have you seen the stock market bloodbath today?  Jeff and Trump are silent on this one.
3517 2018-02-05 20:22:36 Wish I understood stocks and why the Dow is making headlines
3518 2018-02-05 20:22:36 Bought bank stocks at -1000. So yeah...
3519 2018-02-05 20:22:27 Feels good. Sold my stocks and funds last week. Now, please start a housing bubble as well pls.
3520 2018-02-05 20:22:25 There had to be a ton of automatic sales once stocks hit a certain number, that's why it was down 1500.
3521 2018-02-05 20:22:24 THAT WAS FUCKING AWESOME. Time to go shopping! #stocks
3522 2018-02-05 20:22:23 any experienced investor knows that the day traders are taking money off the table no big deal think of it a retail store  having a 10% discount sale for stocks
3523 2018-02-05 20:22:23 Hmm stocks 5% from ATH, Crypto 60% lol nice comparison
3524 2018-02-05 20:22:20 Stocks? Bitcoin?
3525 2018-02-05 20:22:20 I dunno shit about stocks but being "down 800" doesn't sound like a positive development.
3526 2018-02-05 20:22:18 Treasury yields have dropped to a low of 2.71% but not nearly on the scale of the move in stocks.
3527 2018-02-05 20:22:18 NO ONE, NO ONE, knows why stocks sold off in 1929 ... TO THIS DAY!
3528 2018-02-05 20:22:18 If this was a risk parity thing, why was the selling in stocks accelerating as bonds were rallying?
3529 2018-02-05 20:22:14 man how does the stonk market go down in points???? just buy more stocks. dumb shit fuckin idiots
3530 2018-02-05 20:22:12 Maybe I can buy some stocks really quickly.  But I own such a diverse profile I wouldn't know what else to buy.
3531 2018-02-05 20:22:12 Mr Quest said don't worry about the numbers, pay attention to the percentage???  Color me confused.  I'm no genius with stocks but doesn't one reflect the other?  He must speak trumpish. #CNN
3532 2018-02-05 20:22:12 As you know, some(even many) stocks will be down and others trending up nicely on any given day!
3533 2018-02-05 20:22:09 Glad I stayed out of stocks.
3534 2018-02-05 20:22:05 WOW!!! DOW PLUNGES 1,500 POINTS!! @realDonaldTrump as you spew your stupid, ignorant BULL SHIT stocks are falling! FUCK YOU BTW!
3535 2018-02-05 20:22:04 @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC so what? You all decided to take a stand and switch to news about stocks to scare people.. bye bye @realDonaldTrump
3536 2018-02-05 20:22:01 the Dow is Still 6,000+ more than it ever was under Obama.
Stocks go up and Stocks go down, It's Good in the long run.
3537 2018-02-05 20:22:01 ■CNN速報(米版)：President Trump talks to workers in Ohio. Watch now
Stocks are on a roller-coaster. Here's the Dow Jones ticker
3538 2018-02-05 20:22:01 Remind me never to put money in stocks. I'd be yanking my hair out right about now
3539 2018-02-05 20:21:53 Is @realDonaldTrump going to claim the largest intra-day drop of Dow in the history of the Stocks Market? What happened to the 8 Trillion? Is Economy going South? Tax Bill did not work? Where does this leave @GOP ? @Defeat_GOP @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
3540 2018-02-05 20:21:52 @zerohedge Fang stocks big sell signals

3541 2018-02-05 20:21:51 Get your shit together Wall Street. It’s only a slight risk of an interest rate hike. God damn. #stocks #WallStreet #Dow
3542 2018-02-05 20:21:49 Didn’t they warn us stocks would go down if the Patriots lost? Go ahead and scoff at these indicators that are just coincidences! This is a fine co-inky-dink!
3543 2018-02-05 20:21:48 Since @realDonaldTrump claims the stock market’s rise as his victory, he’ll take ownership for the plummet, right? #stocks #GOP #FairyTales #TrumpFails
3544 2018-02-05 20:21:47 Stocks go up, and stocks go down. Can’t go up forever, so they have to go down sometime. On its own, it just means the system is working.

If it drops like this everyday... that’s when we bite our nails nervously. (For our retirement accounts, that is.)
3545 2018-02-05 20:21:42 Stocks down also just sayin' HODL
3546 2018-02-05 20:21:34 Soon, the #Cryptoverse will learn that #Crypto is part of the Everything Bubble. In the meltdown, bonds, stocks, crypto, real estate, & commodities will have a correlation close to 1. Tough lessons coming.
3547 2018-02-05 20:21:34 I got all my money in typewriter stocks. It’s sure to make a comeback.
3548 2018-02-05 20:21:33 ah shit there goes the value of all the stocks i definitely own
3549 2018-02-05 20:21:31 Taking solace in the fact that 75% of the stocks I own only trade once a week tops...lol...
3550 2018-02-05 20:21:26 Before anyone says it, don’t blame #ETFs #Dow #stocks
3551 2018-02-05 20:21:23 Across the board, wages are up 3% this year (due mostly to a tight labor market). It has nothing to do w/ the tax law. Increased wage costs + expected inflation increases = increased cost of doing business. Ergo, stocks are relatively less attractive to bonds
3552 2018-02-05 20:21:22 the dow is 30 stocks
3553 2018-02-05 20:21:21 DEEP STATE SELLING OFF STOCKS!
3554 2018-02-05 20:21:13 Time to dust off the treacherous market playbook!  Beware of up opens and down closes from here. #stocks #DowJones
3555 2018-02-05 20:21:12 Flash crash wow #DowJones #stocks MARKET BREAKS $VIX $VXX
3556 2018-02-05 20:21:07 It's official. #Cramer is just talking to hear himself talk. "The last 500-600 pts down weren't real." No one in possession of their faculties or stocks could possibly believe this. THE F*UCKING PRICE IS THE PRICE $SPX $NDX $IWM
3557 2018-02-05 20:21:04 Buckle up. Here we go again. #algorithms #stocks
3558 2018-02-05 20:21:03 A lot of people are getting some nice discounts on great stocks they've been eyeballing for a while.
3559 2018-02-05 20:21:01 The stocks were going up because of machines, too.
3560 2018-02-05 20:20:59 Stocks on sale, switching the pension to 100% stock purchase .
3561 2018-02-05 20:20:50 It will be fine.  It is a reaction to finding out one half of the American system is so corrupt that it goes through DNC, FBI and Obama White House.  Believing that this is tip of the corruption would upset stocks.  You can put this where it belongs...DEMOCRATS
3562 2018-02-05 20:20:50 should i sell my stocks or self immolate
3563 2018-02-05 20:20:49 You, an imbecile: My stocks!

Me, a wise person: I keep my entire net worth of $27.32 taped to my torso at all times
3564 2018-02-05 20:20:49 We get it. Libtards that are rooting for America to fail. 
#Stock #skyrockets - #Obama's doing. #Stocks #dive - #Trump's #fault.
3565 2018-02-05 20:20:47 666 , is an interesting number...   Nothing more would make the New World Order CABAL happier than For USA to have economic failure under Trump.  DOW will have its BEAR  runs until the Energy stocks  create the greatest boom ever seen
3566 2018-02-05 20:20:47 There are 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. All but one (Apple) is down today, most by about 2%
3567 2018-02-05 20:20:46 When determining whether you want to invest in a stock or fund that is "down" you want to determine if it is on clearance (never coming back from that) or on sale (just temporarily discounted until things go back to normal).

This is not the mall. Do not buy stocks on clearance.
3568 2018-02-05 20:20:46 ok. a sell out.. nice. we´re reducing our hedge positions ( vola spike is an additional profit ). We´re looking for some stocks to buy and writing calls.
3569 2018-02-05 20:20:46 Another big drop in stocks.  How come you're not taking credit for that???  Who YOU going to blame?
3570 2018-02-05 20:20:45 This is a great opportunity for #stocks just like I mentioned in the room earlier.   #Volatility is what us #Daytraders look for every day.
3571 2018-02-05 20:20:39 Relax.  The stock market is not the economy, people. #markets #commodities #bonds #stocks #StockMarket #hedgefunds #Investors
3572 2018-02-05 20:20:36 That is good to know. I appreciate it!  As someone who has worked in journalism her whole life and has no money as a result, I rarely follow stocks. but this was amazing
3573 2018-02-05 20:20:31 My stocks!!!
3574 2018-02-05 20:20:31 This selloff in stocks going to set up some good buys in a day or so
3575 2018-02-05 20:20:31 ABC is a joke..market made new highs daily, weekly and monthly and not one tweet..not a peep..u gave Trump no credit for stocks on the way up..it sells off 2 days and immediately you start chirping, typical selective reporting #hypocrisy
3576 2018-02-05 20:20:30 It's a pullback that was going to happen. Stocks were overvalued. The crazy rise over the last year was going to result in a pullback at some point.

3582 2018-02-05 20:20:25 why stocks crash wtf
3583 2018-02-05 20:20:22 Think how much more stocks would be down if the Patriots had won
3584 2018-02-05 20:20:21 No no. It's the Dems fault when stocks go down. Or maybe Obama and the Deep State. Or is it emails...?

3588 2018-02-05 20:20:15 Hey jackass. The stocks are plummeting! Freaking idiot!@realDonaldTrump
3589 2018-02-05 20:20:15 it was bound to drop like this...it's been on overdrive.   I think everyone was wanting to push stocks up since they knew the rate hike was coming soon.
3590 2018-02-05 20:20:13 totally agree....sure hope HIS stocks (and the whole cabinet with him) are SINKING too.  We were kinda lucky to have pulled quite a bit out in June.
3591 2018-02-05 20:20:12 Where the hell are ppl getting the stocks are strong right now
3592 2018-02-05 20:20:10 Talk about stock manipulation
The wealthy are picking up stocks for real deals now
3593 2018-02-05 20:20:08 Reminder: 1st S&P500 circuit breaker comes at a 7% drop 
NYSE Rule 80B: circuit-breaker halt for a Level 1 (7%) or Level 2 (13%) decline would result in a trading halt in all stocks for 15 minutes. If S&P declines by 20%, triggering a Level 3 circuit-breaker, trading halted.

3598 2018-02-05 20:20:00 Yo what stocks should I buy right now
3599 2018-02-05 20:19:56 looking online a bunch of the big tech company stocks are also falling, most having just experienced a sudden spike in losses then a equivalent rebound (like a sharp deep v at the base of a hill)
3600 2018-02-05 20:19:55 at some point people were bound to sell to take advantage of these endless record gains. 
I wonder what the trigger was for stocks around the world tumbling today.
3601 2018-02-05 20:19:54 WOW. Stocks cut their losses in HALF! From 1600 down to just 860 in the blink of an eye. PPT in action... #FAKEMARKETS
3602 2018-02-05 20:19:53 I think the #Market plunge is about more than just concerns about possible inflation. The kind of daily turmoil generated by @realDonaldTrump is frightening--and that unease is driving down stocks.
3603 2018-02-05 20:19:53 Absolutely no fucking relevance as most investing in stocks and shares wouldn’t touch crypto with a barge pole…. stop clutching at straws
3604 2018-02-05 20:19:51 BREAKING NEWS: 
STOCKS DOWN 1,600 POINTS, AT ONE POINT, NOW DOWN 800. #CHUCKnDALLAS
3605 2018-02-05 20:19:50 You are kidding right? They are taking out profits because stocks are falling. Why would they invest in crypto?
3606 2018-02-05 20:19:50 Tweeps I've said it ... we all need to take our cash out... it's gonna collapse.... these rich folk wanna buy back their stocks at low prices.. to fatten the shareholders more... it's maga like in 1928
3607 2018-02-05 20:19:49 Markets going down is when you need capital to predict bottoms and be ready to "buy, buy, buy". Some of my stocks could get close in a week.
3608 2018-02-05 20:19:49 Stocks on sale! Time to buy.
3609 2018-02-05 20:19:49 Let's be real. You don't have stocks.
3610 2018-02-05 20:19:48 Check out Canadian weed stocks!  Down cuz of this mess but going up, up, up!  So you can buy low, sell high!  Don’t sell while actually high... well unless that’s your strategy, no judgement.  #Canada #Trudeau 
3611 2018-02-05 20:19:46 BTC is pretty much 2014-15 repeating itself. That scene will strip back to just the hardcore ppl by end of year and then could be ripe for investing again. Long overdue for correction. $1000+ price dips in stocks hasn't happened in years.
3612 2018-02-05 20:19:46 Stock skyrockets - Obama's doing. Stocks dive - Trump's fault.
3613 2018-02-05 20:19:45 Looks like it was a domino trade...Risk Parity (long stocks and bonds) did some unwinding...which caused CTA momentum funds (long stocks, short bonds) to unwind, which caused VIX shorts to get stopped out, which leads to the global reset.
3614 2018-02-05 20:19:42 BUY STOCKS so we can make Shepherd Smith hush about this “very scary day.”
He’s reporting like it’s 1929.
3615 2018-02-05 20:19:42 Donald Trump: "stocks can go down?"
3616 2018-02-05 20:19:40 Bet lots of people tweeting about the Stock Market don't really even know what it is outside of, "you buy stocks."
3617 2018-02-05 20:19:40 It’s nice when the stock market makes its correction all in 1 day. Smooth and super enjoyable, eh? #stocks #DOWdown2k

3628 2018-02-05 20:19:24 @realDonaldTrump  "U.S. stocks are plunging Monday as banks and healthcare and energy companies slip. The Dow Jones industrial average sank more than 1,000 points, more than erasing all the gains it made this year." - LA @latimes

3630 2018-02-05 20:19:18 I'm not a genius for moving from stocks to bonds after Trump's election. Anyone with a brain knew that the Cut 'n Borrow Republicans would do exactly what they always do.
3631 2018-02-05 20:19:14 Stocks falling, WINNING HAHAHAHA @realDonaldTrump

3638 2018-02-05 20:18:58 Stocks fell 1,500 points...NOW you know Trump is going to blame Obama and the Democrats.
3639 2018-02-05 20:18:58 Is it time to sell stocks and allocate to crypto?

3649 2018-02-05 20:18:47 Another possibility is that people see good entry into crypto right now so they selling their stocks.
3650 2018-02-05 20:18:44 People are dropping losing stocks and picking up  winners now.
3651 2018-02-05 20:18:44 Shorting stocks?
3652 2018-02-05 20:18:43 Buying back of stocks in the final hour of trading is a positive indicator.

#hypocrisy
3656 2018-02-05 20:18:29 .@AliVelshi Might the drop in stocks have anything to do with the fact that the government needs to borrow an additional $1 trillion - a jump of 84% - just to pay our bills? That level of debt increase can't be good for the economy, right? (Well, not for ours - China's maybe.)

3658 2018-02-05 20:18:25 Stocks & crypto markets not looking so good! 
3659 2018-02-05 20:18:23 Attention warriors.
Bait switch in process, stocks down blame stream media will be reporting dooms day.
Keep your head on what's at hand #LockHerUp is the prize.
3660 2018-02-05 20:18:22 stay the course and play the long game if you invest in index funds. the market in the short term is fickle. 
If the market is down buy, if the market is up, buy. Worst thing to do is try to time it. Referring to stocks/bonds. Not crypto of course.
3661 2018-02-05 20:18:21 Is anyone has stocks, sell those quick
3662 2018-02-05 20:18:20 All my stocks are in the red, just gotta trust the process 
3663 2018-02-05 20:18:19 On a day when risk assets - cryptos & stocks - are taking a heavy beating, gold is up. #instructive
3664 2018-02-05 20:18:19 Were you taking about Bitcoin or stocks?

3670 2018-02-05 20:18:11 U.S. markets' big sell off happening in parallel of the VIX climbing above 30. That's a panic driven movement. Don't sell, BUY. Fundamentals remain STRONG #equities #stocks #DowJones #SP500 #NASDAQ
3671 2018-02-05 20:18:09 Don't think I'll look at my stocks today
3672 2018-02-05 20:18:07 By their nature, stocks fluctuate.
3673 2018-02-05 20:18:02 Wtf
3674 2018-02-05 20:17:58 Very thankful I cashed out all of my individual stocks (minus 1) when the market opened today. Stocks in a free fall right now...
3675 2018-02-05 20:17:55 No, don't go back up, sink stupid stocks, SINK!
3676 2018-02-05 20:17:54 I sold all my stocks into bonds just last week. So thankful.
3677 2018-02-05 20:17:54 @realDonaldTrump Crack head PUPPET rally today for fellow Crack Head DEPLORABLES. Bond yields are crashing fast due to PUPPET trump taxes. Ryan and PUPPET never said. Now you know. MULLER FOLLOW THE MONEY RICO ACT. PPL SELL UR STOCKS FAST. PUPPET RYAN F****** YOU

3679 2018-02-05 20:17:52 Does the fact that #Rothschild sold off shit have anythin to do with #stocks?
3680 2018-02-05 20:17:51 Hey people invested in stocks #buythedip stop selling off and making everybody lose money
3681 2018-02-05 20:17:46 Interrupt @realDonaldTrump speech in Cincinnati so Shep Smith could report Stocks down! And he's enjoying every minute of it!! #BadShep #GoToCNN
3682 2018-02-05 20:17:45 good time to invest in stocks
3683 2018-02-05 20:17:44 Omg. It’s only 3:17. And it’s recovered 700 points already. *dead* #stocks
3684 2018-02-05 20:17:43 Even my WWE stocks took a big Orange cheeto kick in the groin!
3685 2018-02-05 20:17:40 POTUS is speaking at Scheffer corporation, where employees received USD$1,000 in bonus after tax reform. If their retirement savings are in stocks, they just lost that same 1k today.
3686 2018-02-05 20:17:34 Don't "sleep" on this fantastic buying opportunity!!! <rolls up sleeves & starts buying stocks> Get well soon please...
3687 2018-02-05 20:17:34 Damn, jealous! Hopefully the guy who stocks the shelves stays there!
3688 2018-02-05 20:17:33 T-Bond futures now up a point and a half. The stock selloff was supposedly about rising interest rates, leading bond prices s and stocks to both fall together. Now "flight to quality" is back.

3692 2018-02-05 20:17:29 Big sale on stocks in the market today, everything must go! No offer too low to be accepted!
3693 2018-02-05 20:17:27 And that kids, is why you don't get all smug and brag about stocks going up
3694 2018-02-05 20:17:27 Honestly, I've been waiting for people who've blindly thrown money into FAANG stocks over the past three months to get punched in the gut. It's healthy.
3695 2018-02-05 20:17:20 #FoxNews - Seems like any negative news such as stocks dumping has ur anti - Trump, snarky Shep Smith almost ecstatic! What a shame, it’s like watching CNN!
3696 2018-02-05 20:17:19 THE CORRECTIONS: DOW IN DEEP DOO-DOO AS STOCKS DROP AND ROLL
3697 2018-02-05 20:17:15 Whoohoo!! Stocks are on sale!
3698 2018-02-05 20:17:13 I'm afraid to look at my stocks-never had money in my life for them-finally get some just in time for the Trump dump-just my rotten stinking luck
3699 2018-02-05 20:17:13 @realDonaldTrump if you take credit when the stocks rise, you need to take credit when they fall. But maybe it's all #fakeNews or just plain #AlternativeFacts

3701 2018-02-05 20:17:09 Yes - of the downside pot. in stocks imo. EURUSD is turning. When it accelerates - drops in equities will be greater
3702 2018-02-05 20:17:07 *my brand voice* my stocks
3703 2018-02-05 20:17:04 Well she needs to think BIG. I am using my $1000 and tax cut to go see the world. Maybe retire at 40, buy a cabin on a lake. And whatever is left, I will invest it in stocks.
3704 2018-02-05 20:17:04 Except portfolios are going down, which means anyone who has stocks in the market is directly impacted. Good News may be a form of Fake News.
3705 2018-02-05 20:17:02 reminder that HODL is actually a pretty good strategy with stocks
3706 2018-02-05 20:16:59 Glad $0 of my retirement fund is in stocks
3707 2018-02-05 20:16:58 Don’t buy or sell stocks at the moment. This is average drop at this time to prevent inflation. Just repeating what is being posted.
3708 2018-02-05 20:16:51 I am now plus 2 x crisps & 1 x biscuit, minus 1 pint of blood and I feel great. Please donate blood if you are able stocks are low right now @GiveBloodNHS
3709 2018-02-05 20:16:51 Somebody is buying a HELL of a lot of stocks right now. It bottomed out at 1600 and now it's back up to 915.

It seems like there's no rhyme or reason to ANY of it.
3710 2018-02-05 20:16:46 Now #DJI dropped 1,200 points. Is #Trump still bragging? He shouldn't even mention the bonds and stocks.
3711 2018-02-05 20:16:45 My Manwich (stocks)!
3712 2018-02-05 20:16:43 I... I think I remember that it was comprehensive: an average of 10% losses on ALL stocks traded on NYSE.

I might be wrong; I'm not an SME. The SME's are probably a little bit busy right about now.
3713 2018-02-05 20:16:42 #stocks plummeted on #stoploss triggered across the board. That means they can't buy anymore until further notice or show me the money. #MAT is probably worst. Watch out for more liquidation.
3714 2018-02-05 20:16:41 @realDonaldTrump
Stocks dropping down
Looks like a premonition for your future. You're going down
3715 2018-02-05 20:16:40 Haven't seen stocks this volatile since the day the Dukes had to put their seats up for auction.
3716 2018-02-05 20:16:39 Smart Money BUYING stocks NOW. 
#BuyLow #SellHigh
3717 2018-02-05 20:16:38 Stocks are down, cryptos are super down, the world is ending, but I got #STRONGHANDS
3718 2018-02-05 20:16:35 Among the stocks I follow, many are down 3%, 4%, or 5% - then I look at the actual price and wonder "When the heck did it get all the way up there!?!?!"
3719 2018-02-05 20:16:32 Seaweed stocks. Buy low... sell a bit lower.
3720 2018-02-05 20:16:32 This TAX BILL officially took effect in the beginning of February 2018
Is it coincidence that the "Market" is TANKING?
Devaluing US dollar means EVERYONE pays more, for everything.  Like more for over rated stocks in the market.
The TAX BILL will be the death nail for the GOP!
3721 2018-02-05 20:16:29 And the #Dow's just back up 500 points in the last few minutes.  #stocks #WallStreet
3722 2018-02-05 20:16:28 $CRSP $EDIT $ICPT $VRTX $INCY Load your truck with these biotech stocks now.  Don't scare!  Opportunity Opportunity!

3724 2018-02-05 20:16:25 Vas-y j'adore ce que tu me balances, vide tes stocks d'OST ! xD
3725 2018-02-05 20:16:24 Stocks dropping rapidly 
3726 2018-02-05 20:16:23 DOW's a propaganda index of 30 stocks that isn't even market cap weighted so I take it with grain of salt
3727 2018-02-05 20:16:21 Dow down -1500 points, but when all this dust settles in stocks.. imo should look to buy
3728 2018-02-05 20:16:19 Yeah not even gonna bother checking my stocks
3729 2018-02-05 20:16:18 Not sure if that was a flash crash or if stocks now just play catch-up to the downside. I only added $xiv
3730 2018-02-05 20:16:18 3 out of 4 stocks follow the market. DJX is looking like a short sellers dream. Time to dust off those old short selling DVD strategies. If not some may get swallowed by this market. @timothysykes @profitly
3731 2018-02-05 20:16:17 Sure glad I sold all my stocks last week...
3732 2018-02-05 20:16:17 Stocks are crashing ? 
3733 2018-02-05 20:16:17 People are selling downside insurance right now, in return they have to short stocks to hedge. The market moved to high too fast. A correction was obvious. There is no bubble. P/E ratios have been around 19 times for 3 years. Fundamentals haven't changed.
3734 2018-02-05 20:16:17 Don't be so overjoyed. A correction happens quite a bit. 6 times in last 10 years.
You just hate @realDonaldTrump and his base knows stocks are controlled by the elite and establishment. It will be back.
3735 2018-02-05 20:16:16 I ain’t got stocks, but unfortunately the ebbs and flows of the stupid market do trickle down on piss poor bitches like me eventually. Still...I’ll await #Trump efforts to blame the market’s recent nosedive on Obama. 

Are we “great” again, yet?

#MAGAMyAss
3736 2018-02-05 20:16:15 Most stocks are waaaaaay overvalued. The main question is, is this a healthy correction or the start of a potential bear market?? Most companies missed their earnings estimates, the tax bill will help offset that though, inflating stock prices again.
3737 2018-02-05 20:16:14 @ShepNewsTeam Giving investment advice and using dramatic hyperbole in his "news" coverage of today's #market correction. Pretty sure I'd follow your own expert's advice. #Stocks have lost and gained hundreds of points in minutes. #DowJones #Drama
3738 2018-02-05 20:16:12 Stocks now rising.
3739 2018-02-05 20:16:11 #WallStreet In the last 2 weeks weve seen a correction of at least 10% in the making. If you've been investing and you're 18 to 40. this is a golden opportunity  to dollar cost average your investment in stocks, but be watchful and patient. Don't be greedy like many investors.
3740 2018-02-05 20:16:09 Oh baby, DOW tanking down over 1,000.  

 Donald Trump NOR Sarah Huckabee Sanders will even touch talking about the stock market the last couple of days.  They can shove the stock market down people's throats that have no stocks, now I wonder how their throats are feeling now.
3741 2018-02-05 20:16:06 Stocks fluctuate by nature.
3742 2018-02-05 20:16:05 I hate when people make me check stocks when I’m not planning to buy. I feel distraught lol
3743 2018-02-05 20:16:03 People that sold all the stocks. and made mad money.
3744 2018-02-05 20:16:00 She was talking about retirement funds which hold stocks long term.
3745 2018-02-05 20:15:55 Out all I want to throw at it right now...holding until this thing stops the free fall.  Stocks too.  At least my metals are + lol
3746 2018-02-05 20:15:54 Buying #EarningsWinners (Stocks .. not options) .. going to be #StressFree when market picks up.
3747 2018-02-05 20:15:47 three thoughts. 1) I don't feel as bad about missing the january rally. 2) we are bouncing too early. still have 45 minutes to go 3) i had the same thoughts when stocks plunged on Trump's election and was wrong then.
3748 2018-02-05 20:15:47 Stock market goes into huge correction today.  Rich are moving their profits from 2017 into new businesses to take advantage of tax laws, less regulations, and better trade deals.  We live in amazing times. #DJI #stocks #dowjones #jobExplosion
3749 2018-02-05 20:15:43 Equifax failed to update the software program they were using, caused millions to have their identity stolen and  their CEOs sold stocks prior to informing the public. #Equifax
3750 2018-02-05 20:15:42 Stocks are on sale today.. snatch up what you like, they won't be on sale for very long.
3751 2018-02-05 20:15:42 @StephenKing Damn that DOW keeps on going huh?! Ohh just thought of a good horror involving “Killer Stocks”
3752 2018-02-05 20:15:41 All this hoopala over 30 stocks LMAO
3753 2018-02-05 20:15:39 @ShepSmithNews Come on, Dumbass! Panicking about one or two days of stocks going down only means that salaries are going up! Get back to Trump’s live speech and stop acting like CNN and the liberal asshole that you are! This BS can wait!
3754 2018-02-05 20:15:37 The traditional stocks dropping dramatically kinda sucks cuz that shit affects everyone one way or another but Bitcoin being in free fall is hilarious
3755 2018-02-05 20:15:36 Neither. Stocks :)
3756 2018-02-05 20:15:36 US stocks were in freefall mode on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding over 1,500 points

3764 2018-02-05 20:15:21 @larry_kudlow How are your beloved tax cuts working out for you. Buy stocks now while they are cheap, and fuck the deficit.
3765 2018-02-05 20:15:21 What about stocks ?
3766 2018-02-05 20:15:20 STOCKS ARE DOWN AND SO AM I!
3767 2018-02-05 20:15:18 It’s this what president #44 got us out of these stocks falling and crashes like this???
3768 2018-02-05 20:15:18 several answers -- stocks have been overvalued for a while now -- fears about raising interest rates, fears about trillion dollar debt - due to raising interest rate, investors see Mueller coming and political instability -- instability always bad
3769 2018-02-05 20:15:13 @realDonaldTrump Following Friday's 666-point plunge, the downdraft in stocks resumed  Monday with the Dow Jones industrial average briefly going into freefall  right after the opening bell. 
DEVIL DONALD 666 RUINING AMERICA!!

3774 2018-02-05 20:15:11 My mother had all of her retirement in tech stocks.  It was a massacre.
3775 2018-02-05 20:15:09 Today's stock market performance should be a lesson to anyone who thinks that stocks are indicative of real world economic output or wages.

It's literally just speculation.
3776 2018-02-05 20:15:04 @andersoncooper this segment is a perfect example of y @CNN has become unwatchable. Stocks soar - either crickets or it was because of Obama. We get a correction and now it gets coverage and @realDonaldTrump owns it.
3777 2018-02-05 20:14:58 Do you think bank stocks are a good investment. Interest rates are going up, that why this is happening.
3778 2018-02-05 20:14:56 Blood bath stocks plus cryptos
3779 2018-02-05 20:14:55 Hey @realDonaldTrump wanna take credit for the #StockMarket now? #crash #stocks #Dow #DowJones #NASDAQ #trading
3780 2018-02-05 20:14:54 Gotta believe that @cafreeland isn't so displeased with the $SPX meltdown. Meanwhile, interesting that the #INKCIN is continuing its outperformance vs. US stocks from Friday. Of course, all that can change in 30 minutes. #cdnecon #cdnpoli
3781 2018-02-05 20:14:52 The Fed tanks the stocks. The Fed tanks the stocks. The Fed tanks the stocks.

Must be someone in the White House who isn’t a Democrat.
3782 2018-02-05 20:14:49 Why does it appear that the media reports stock market fails much more than when stocks are bouncing off the proverbial chart
Just me?
Now, now, everyone just fucking relax
3783 2018-02-05 20:14:45 Stock markets continue to drop. Now at -1,100+ #Stockstowatch #markets #stocks
3784 2018-02-05 20:14:42 Global stocks are plunging..... S&P 500 is down 3.62%, the Dow is down 4.46%. Stocks are on sale... This is the best time to buy
3785 2018-02-05 20:14:41 Now stocks  are dropping every day
3786 2018-02-05 20:14:40 And may all Trump supporters who have stocks reap the winds you all have sown. You DESERVE this for undermining this country.
3787 2018-02-05 20:14:39 Stocks go up and down. Don't play the game if you can't stand to lose.
3788 2018-02-05 20:14:36 If DT is responsible for uptick in stocks he owns it when they fall. Nice job Donald!
3789 2018-02-05 20:14:29 What happened to the plunge protection team? Okay, PPT is back at work and they are buying stocks again.
3790 2018-02-05 20:14:26 wait a second, stocks go down? #Beensolong
3791 2018-02-05 20:14:25 @FoxNews we'd like to know from somebody farther up why all of our stocks are plummeting to almost nothing is it because our government and Sessions hasn't arrested all these criminal hugs within our borders that is controling America until they get behind so Americans suffer.
3792 2018-02-05 20:14:22 STOCKS PLUNGE ON PATRIOT LOSS!!!
3793 2018-02-05 20:14:22 Quoting the Dow is dumb, it's not 1995 anymore, look at the S&P500 and other broad indicesr. Quoting points is also dumb, normalize it to %. 

All that said, -5% on the day is no fun, but the smooth up and to the right ride we've been on is not how stocks usually work.
3794 2018-02-05 20:14:21 stocks...whoa....numbers etc
3795 2018-02-05 20:14:20 So what's worst? Dow and S&P correction? Or bitcoin correction?? #Bitcoin #btc #ETH #ethereum #Litecoin #LTC #dow #DowJones #stocks #StockMarketCrash
3796 2018-02-05 20:14:19 As ugly as today is for #stocks and #crypto, overnight may get worse with global macro margin calls and unwinds across multi-asset classes. Sadly, the race back to “safe haven fiat” includes all of the profiteering crypto weak hands. Hope I’m wrong but the sauce smells strong.
3797 2018-02-05 20:14:19 This volatility is INSANE #stocks
3798 2018-02-05 20:14:17 tRUmp keeps talking, stocks keep crashing...
3799 2018-02-05 20:14:16 Further weighing on sentiment, at the weekend ex-US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen told brodcaster CBS that stocks' price-to-earnings multiples were at the high end of their historical range.
3800 2018-02-05 20:14:14 Stocks down, crypto down and interest still fucking low.
 
 I guess the party is over.

3802 2018-02-05 20:14:12 #Forex #Dow Looking for the Dow to fall to 23,955 before we recover 10% healthy wealthy and wise. Retail all got in to the Stocks in January and the clever Goldies sold into them. #MugPunters
3803 2018-02-05 20:14:10 The over inflated wall street has to correct itself and the surf Little Donnie has been riding and claiming he is responsible for is going to show the final nail about what a lying fraud he is !!! Stocks today down 1100
 Friday 666 and 300 Thurs.  That’s 2000 in 3 days folks !!
3804 2018-02-05 20:14:07 Its a factor, but not the only one and certainly not the most important. Those stocks that make up the DOW are way overvalued. Also we all have to admit that this was inevitable.

3808 2018-02-05 20:13:58 Stocks have been way over-valued. If the DJIA falls to 22,000 I would not be alarmed. (Well, I am invested in gold and silver...)
3809 2018-02-05 20:13:49 As @kairyssdal has always said on @Marketplace ... The stocks go down!! #carnage #StockMarket #StockMarketToday
3810 2018-02-05 20:13:43 .@realDonaldTrump I own stocks and I'm THRILLED this is hurting you.
3811 2018-02-05 20:13:42 I'm not saying it's his doing on either end. But Twitter fingers @realDonaldTrump is quick to toot his horn on rising stocks but dead silent when they fall like they are now.....
3812 2018-02-05 20:13:36 Been a long time since I’ve seen this. Time to dust off the algos that work when stocks actually move places intraday. $SPY
3813 2018-02-05 20:13:34 #stocks Guess #Dotard finally got a historical record he can claim all his own - drop in stock market number. I think intelligent businessmen realized he's fucking up our country.

3823 2018-02-05 20:13:06 Hey @realDonaldTrump, are we allowed to sue you and the @GOP controlled Congress for all we lost in the current stock market crash? I mean, you said we should sue ABC when stocks dipped momentarily for Brian Ross’s reporting. Because of you morons’ memo the markets have tanked.

3827 2018-02-05 20:13:02 Wow, stocks are not in a correction, they're in a free fall.

Inflation worries?
3831 2018-02-05 20:12:54 I think my dad said something about how what happened on Friday gave people the entire weekend to stew over the idea of panicking and selling all their stocks off on Monday and now that's what's happening
3832 2018-02-05 20:12:53 So if the stocks have erased their gains under Trump’s year, can we erase Trump’s year as president?

3848 2018-02-05 20:12:22 Trump’s on a roll, now he’s saying democrats are treasonous. He’s throwing our justice department under the bus telling factory workers their bonus is forever. That we are going to make all products, made in America. Yet his family’s biz. Is all over seas. Stocks -1600.87 down
3849 2018-02-05 20:12:18 Nary a peep from Dump about stocks. He bragged n blamed about all cept stock market. Will he own a correction, bump or slump. He's too shitty for that.

3884 2018-02-05 20:11:23 Stocks are one thing people hate when they go on sale.
3885 2018-02-05 20:11:21 Markets are tanking essentially because they’ve done so well. This unexpected growth we have seen has also accelerated the increase in the the fed funds (int) rate over next few years. We are seeing the market price in future interest hikes/volatility. #stocks
3886 2018-02-05 20:11:21 US stocks crashing... panic everywhere
3887 2018-02-05 20:11:20 Woah the stocks just went crazy.
3888 2018-02-05 20:11:18 Why aint yoy saying anything about the stocks? You were taking credit when it was up you should man up and take blame now that has dropped, right after you approved the release of the memo
3889 2018-02-05 20:11:17 @realDonaldTrump the Dow is down 1,056 points.  It seems stocks are in a free fall. What do you have to say about that?  Your watch, your economy, your responsibility . . . or are you going to blame @BarackObama.
3890 2018-02-05 20:11:14 #Bond rates matter as we are finding out. But good luck timing when the market will care. But that is the game,people. If you don’t like it don’t play #stocks #gravity

3896 2018-02-05 20:11:00 Bold Prediction: @realDonaldTrump, having crowed ad nauseum taking credit for the Dow’s rise, will go quiet as a frickin’ church mouse about stocks if these daily plummets continue, much less get worse.

3903 2018-02-05 20:10:42 Your first day at work:

U.S. stocks fall 1,300 points.
3904 2018-02-05 20:10:41 Good time to buy stocks
3905 2018-02-05 20:10:41 Stocks are a bloodbath. Huge drops.
3906 2018-02-05 20:10:37 Look at stocks. You even will not have a rising economy to brag about in 9 months. Dow is down 1000 points in 1 day.
3907 2018-02-05 20:10:35 I read this tweet and thought maybe my stocks app was on a tape delay, thinking it had gone back up.
3908 2018-02-05 20:10:30 Market declines are never fun. We're down about 6% from recent S&P 500 highs. But we can learn a lot from them.  If you're feeling jittery now, you have too much invested in stocks. After all, how would you feel during a legitimate correction (-10%) or bear market(-20%)?
3909 2018-02-05 20:10:30 Dow is now down 1,300 points. That's not something we see every day. Even by Wall Street standards, it's huge. A bloodbath. President Trump was just glowing about rising stocks--it may now be lower than where he began. Something is going on, commentators are sayin. Hmmmmmmm.
3910 2018-02-05 20:10:29 holy fuck stocks are tanking hard.

3913 2018-02-05 20:10:22 @realDonaldTrump  So, Stocks down -1.000 points. People praise you when stocks Rise, does that mean by virtue of human logic. Stocks drop 1000 pts. is it your fault? Use that Stable genius churning very good brain of yours with all the best words?
3914 2018-02-05 20:10:22 UK Market Close: Correction in stocks continues

3924 2018-02-05 20:10:03 I tweeted that there was no bid in the Dow stocks about four minutes ago when it was down about 600. There still isn't, we are down 1,100 now. Get ready for some real action as wide stop orders start getting hit here.
3925 2018-02-05 20:10:01 What is the definition of a “crash”? +/-5% is a normal day move for stocks like $GOOG $TWTR $FB
3926 2018-02-05 20:10:01 you laughed at me when i converted my 401k into raw denim and now look at how humiliated you are while your imaginary stocks disappear

3930 2018-02-05 20:09:53 Many examples for stock trading taking money out of your pockets. Owner put stocks throug the bank in the market, so they have a lot of money in their pockets...then owners sell the company...stocks dive....gone money....

3948 2018-02-05 20:09:00 Shepherd Smith cut President’s speech to announce his disgusting name and how are the stocks are low? We need to vote him out of @FoxNews. We had enough of his venom. He despises President Trump and we despise Shephard Smith!

3952 2018-02-05 20:08:47 1000 point drop in the DOW.

Stocks are in freefall.   Trump took credit for all the stock market gains in January, how will he spin the inevitable correction that follows a runup?
3953 2018-02-05 20:08:46 Stocks getting hammered again today... wow!
3954 2018-02-05 20:08:42 Married with 4 kids   1,000 drop in the Dow means nothing to me   Couldn’t buy penny stocks
3955 2018-02-05 20:08:42 This would be the largest single-day point loss on the Dow, unless stocks recover.
3956 2018-02-05 20:08:41 That’s one fear. We’re also in dangerous price to earnings ratios across the board. Stocks are way overvalued. Have been for months. This thing isn’t over.
3957 2018-02-05 20:08:41 Glad I sold some of my stocks last week...
3958 2018-02-05 20:08:38 Better question, is everyone dumping stocks to buy t-bonds?
3959 2018-02-05 20:08:37 Markets never go straight up everyday. Corrections or 'pullbacks' is when institutional investors take profits.

That is what retail investors should HOPE for because it creates an entry point when the P/E ratios decline which makes stocks less expensive.

3962 2018-02-05 20:08:28 @trish_regan "FAT Cat" DEMS and NY JEWS selling off stocks to punish Trump. No concern for small investors. Just mean ugly vengeance mongers
3963 2018-02-05 20:08:27 $BTC #bitcoin  pullback to $6600 lows!
3964 2018-02-05 20:08:25 Dow down 1000. Computer selling happening. Sit tight. #Stocks
3965 2018-02-05 20:08:22 Holy shit stocks are getting SLAUGHTERED today
3966 2018-02-05 20:08:21 Great day to buy stocks!
#BuyLow #SellHigh
3967 2018-02-05 20:08:16 @realDonaldTrump if there’s a sell off of stocks, conservatives should buy them up and get more control of economy
3968 2018-02-05 20:08:15 Delusional Donald Trump is making Stocks Crash!!  WOW!  Someone shut him up! Lock him up! Turn off his mike!  He is ruining us!!
3969 2018-02-05 20:08:14 Stocks. Are. Down...A Lot
3970 2018-02-05 20:08:10 Is this the start of a global crash? Europe’s stocks and shares were hit yesterday
3971 2018-02-05 20:08:05 Stocks are dropping hard 
3972 2018-02-05 20:07:55 Ich kann gar nicht so schnell tippen: #DowJones verliert 1.000 Punkte! #stocks, #WallStreet
3973 2018-02-05 20:07:55 Don’t panic about the DOW Jones. Stocks were overvalued, and we’re seeing a market correction (pulling profits). The economy is fine. Be aware of the fear mongers. 
3974 2018-02-05 20:07:51 @BeFullyInformed Wow this is pretty scary.  Good stocks 1.5 to 2+ pts under my puts - AXP, COST, DAL, WMT   When do you roll out?
3975 2018-02-05 20:07:50 $AMD omg so many stocks in sale! Buyyy
3976 2018-02-05 20:07:50 Think it has anything to do with the panic selling in stocks? People panic selling here to offset losses there possibly?
3977 2018-02-05 20:07:50 Best thing (if any) from the current stock market correction (off record highs) is the cleansing of the crypto crap. They’re on their way to oblivion #stocks $BTC
3978 2018-02-05 20:07:49 The VIX, or the fear factor in Stocks, rises to 30.49 from 9 on January 5. The higher the number, the more fear in the equity markets.
3979 2018-02-05 20:07:43 Yes, the underlying stocks have value. The question is at what level?
3980 2018-02-05 20:07:42 Leave it up to @FoxNews shepherd smith to cut trumps speech to talk about stocks.

3990 2018-02-05 20:07:15 Just sitting here watching the #DowJones tank. Right after tax reform kicked in...interesting. @realDonaldTrump you’ve owned the stocks all your presidency....what do you have to say? @PressSec? @SpeakerRyan?
3991 2018-02-05 20:07:14 Stockprice has NOTHING to do anymore with the value of a corporation.
In fact: when they need money, they sell new stocks through the banks.
It is like trading in wind.....
3992 2018-02-05 20:07:08 I'm seeing many more single digit PEs out there in Canada and the US. Lowest forward PEs in a while for US stocks because of lower corporate taxes.
3993 2018-02-05 20:07:06 Stocks Crash as Trump speaks & calls people who disagree with him names!! Someone shut off his mike!! He is killing us!!
3994 2018-02-05 20:07:04 Obviously Fox is not concerned with stocks ... only Free Trump PR.
3995 2018-02-05 20:07:02 Yes, most assets are down today.  Some a lot... #diversification working.  #eem not down much, and #gold up.  Much better off diversifying outside of domestic #stocks.
3996 2018-02-05 20:06:59 $SSO. We sold the last shares on Friday at 118.50. Rules. See why? #stocks #investing
3997 2018-02-05 20:06:57 If you own stocks and you voted for Trump, hold ‘em. You owe it to your president to put your money where your mouth is. No matter how much it drops, DON’T SELL! You trust Trump’s business savvy, right? You know he’s looking out for you, right?
3998 2018-02-05 20:06:54 White House says it's 'concerned' about stock market drop

4001 2018-02-05 20:06:45 funny how they are correlated with the US stock market selloff....they are taking cash out of stocks and about to dump big money in CRYPTOS
4002 2018-02-05 20:06:45 I say if you have stocks let it ride!
4003 2018-02-05 20:06:45 Sold all your stocks?
4004 2018-02-05 20:06:41 I'm sure @realDonaldTrump & klan are waiting to scoop up some stocks.
4005 2018-02-05 20:06:39 What a joke, markets go up and down..love clowns like you..u gave him no credit for stocks on the way up, markets made all time highs daily and not a peep.. it sells off for 2 days and immediately you start chirping...predictable hypocrisy #FakeNews
4006 2018-02-05 20:06:39 they were just waiting for Trump's #SOTU, to make him look stupid when he s the one to blame for the stocks crash.
4007 2018-02-05 20:06:32 #DowJones bricht um 900 Punkte ein! #stocks, #WallStreet

4015 2018-02-05 20:06:00 Dow is currently Price decrease  784.18....Friday close at 660 down, after like Monday 500 points down.  That is nearly a 10 percent drop in value of stocks.
4016 2018-02-05 20:06:00 Market crashing wow
4017 2018-02-05 20:05:58 Stock skyrockets - Obama's doing. Stocks dive - Trump's fault.
4018 2018-02-05 20:05:48 The DOW is going to be down near 800. For the poor this means nothing but for those who depend on stocks should worry. Where is Trump bragging about the stock market now.
4019 2018-02-05 20:05:48 NEW...

4025 2018-02-05 20:05:11 adding $AMD and $BABA with a few MJ stocks
4026 2018-02-05 20:05:00 Days like today remind me of the validity of these old stock market maxims:

-"stocks fall 3x faster than they go up"
-"bulls climb the stairs on the way up. bears jump out the window on the way down"

SPY took 40 days to go from 270 to to 286. gave it back in 6 days. Goddamn.
4027 2018-02-05 20:04:59 Stocks have dropped within 1.5% of the next technical support line on the benchmark S&P 500 #stockmarket index, basically back to December levels and wiping out 19 trading days of gains in 4 sessions. Today's villains: $WFC $AMD $QCOM $XOM  etc. Only 4% of index in the green!
4028 2018-02-05 20:04:49 Stocks are on sale! How low will prices go?
4029 2018-02-05 20:04:46 Or that instead of re-investing those billions corps played the dividends game to run up their stocks value. Suckers fell for it again......hook, line and sinker
4030 2018-02-05 20:04:45 DOW JONES down (-782%) 
4031 2018-02-05 20:04:37 Has anybody heard of a market correction before? Wages go up, interest rates go up, Stocks take a hit. Nope...it's partisan politics as usual.
4032 2018-02-05 20:04:32 Dow down by 800 pts. Increase in interest rates putting a downward pressure on stocks. Correction could go on longer.
4033 2018-02-05 20:04:32 @POTUS called out & joked #FakeNews & @MSNBC cut to stocks news. @MarkDice You can't make this stuff up!! Yall do what yall gotta do! #TheStormIsHere

4035 2018-02-05 20:04:30 $DJIA dropped ~1400 pts in two days wiping all gains of 2018 (5wks) YTD. Is it everyone changing their 401K to #DowJones and all stocks  Smart money getting out seeing this dumb inflow #healthy #Correction

4041 2018-02-05 20:03:57 The investors are dumping stocks because the Labor Department said hourly earnings are up 2.9%....and Treasury is having to borrow more money....ya know for tax cuts
4042 2018-02-05 20:03:54 The more Orange  one talkathon goes. The stocks go down 
4043 2018-02-05 20:03:51 Tho stocks are falling.. probably reach new highs once government can get their shit on DACA before gov’t shutdown

4049 2018-02-05 20:03:16 OH HELL NO.   The Dow is down over 800 pts (3 percent) and dropping. It is a bigger crash since Friday where 666 pts fell. Less than half of ppl of US own stocks, 65% own by US citizens 35% foreign. 10% of US owners possess 84% of US owned stock. So it effects the rich mostly.
4050 2018-02-05 20:03:11 Stocks are tanking and so are cryptocurrencies. We taking this L together
4051 2018-02-05 20:03:07 US stocks slide; DJIA -777.  Only two words for a day like this: no fun.
4052 2018-02-05 20:03:07 Oh well, stocks are getting crushed also. The shorts are loving life!
4053 2018-02-05 20:03:04 Whats interesting is that Bonds/Treasuries have gone bid today on #ES_F selloff indicating to me that the fear of more sellers hitting stocks is here.  Which prob means a buying opportunity for stocks is probably not very far from here
4054 2018-02-05 20:03:03 Will the $DJIA correction lead to more investors looking at crypto as a side option #FUD #stocks #crypto

4056 2018-02-05 20:02:49 True, but at the macro level, it appears that what's happening here is that people started out worrying about inflation. All other things equal, as bond yields rise, stocks are less attractive. At this point, panic appears to be a big factor, though...
4057 2018-02-05 20:02:48 This is the time to buy stocks!

4064 2018-02-05 20:02:07 So, do you think they'll ever care? Do you think that Main Street even looks at their IRA or 401K stmts? Or maybe this is anecdotal evidence that not as many folks are exposed to stocks?

4080 2018-02-05 20:00:54 I personally wouldn't touch it without a three day in a row increase. Never buy first bounce on a fall this big. What for a second or third point or an ABCD map. No real strong news for support from anywhere. Mostly procrastination. Less ICOs / Blockchain stocks also tanking.
4081 2018-02-05 20:00:50 I just sold my Pharmaceutical stocks. What water stock you talking about?
4082 2018-02-05 20:00:48 It is a bloodbath in my stock portfolio.  Time to sell off mid to highly volatile stocks, double up on low volatility stable stocks & wait to for the bottoming out to buy up stocks again

4105 2018-02-05 19:59:38 Stocks are diving and @realDonaldTrump is attacking the 70%that doesn't like him.
4106 2018-02-05 19:59:29 And just look at what EEC membership brought us—the destruction of our fishing fleet, fish stocks and fishing communities, higher food prices, beef and butter mountains, wine lakes, endless red tape —the latest being MIFID2, 7,000 pages long—plus billions in annual contributions.

4108 2018-02-05 19:59:20 The Dow is like +6000 since he got in there but spin away...

Obama blames Bush for 8 yrs economic stagnation.
Libtards said Trump win would tank stocks.
Trump's market kicks ass all year, libs try to credit Obama's failed policies.
Trump's market dips a bit, back to his fault.

4113 2018-02-05 19:58:57 So the tax cut was a cushion for the 84% of stocks owned by greed...? I mean the rich..
4114 2018-02-05 19:58:53 I would've bought stocks today but my bone spurs were acting up.....
4115 2018-02-05 19:58:53 Glad that the lack of action in speculative names pushed my exposure down from 160% in december 2017 to 33% three days ago. Your stocks will naturally guide you through all the market fog like a lighthouse. #stocks

4121 2018-02-05 19:58:09 Trump on phone to Powell:  Hey, Jerome, you're doin' a great job. Listen, I know it's your 1st day, but don't u think u & the PPT should be buyin' stocks today to help the mkt? That's what I hired u for.

4122 2018-02-05 19:58:03 True...but Peter have you not behaved the same way, when it comes to cryptocurrency?  We all have our biases.  Markets have cycles.  Stocks & cryptos go up and down and unless you are trading, these are non-events in the long run.
4123 2018-02-05 19:57:58 love the clowns at WAPO..u gave Trump no credit for stocks on the way up..they rallied day after day after day..setting new all time highs, not a peep..they selloff for 2 days and immediately you start chirping...predictable hypocrisy
4124 2018-02-05 19:57:55 A president, a political party, and half the Congress going down for treason is, generally speaking, not a good environment for stocks. A non-economist's 2 cents worth... :)

4129 2018-02-05 19:57:36 After declining for most of the last 36 years, interest rates are set to rise. From such low levels, small increases in rates are large relative changes to the lever used to calculate the NPV of future cash flows from owning stocks.
4130 2018-02-05 19:57:35 Charles,
I'd like to move some cash into a secure individual stock likely to generate 4-5% dividends. What one or two stocks would you recommend?
4131 2018-02-05 19:57:32 S&P 500 off more than 5% from its all-time peak as global ory/us-stocks-poised-for-fresh-selloff-as-dow-futures-slide-120-points-2018-02-05
4132 2018-02-05 19:57:29 It will probably be a very good month for trend followers, short selling stocks.
4133 2018-02-05 19:57:22 This is why only politicians use the stock market. Was it bad judgement  "bragging" about "Wall Street" record increases? This won't go over well when ppl only got "crumbs" in their paychecks and record stocks lifted the wealthy that only can afford them?
4134 2018-02-05 19:57:13 #WallStreet  The Dow is plummeting as the Wizard-in-Chief bloviates to a Republican crowd in Cincinnati providing embarrassingly light applause. If you're 50 or over, be very concerned about your 401K loaded with financial stocks and interest sensitive equities.
4135 2018-02-05 19:57:11 folks, its important to remember the stock market is a cycle with treasury bonds. now bonds R a better deal than stocks. They taking profits from stocks & buying bonds. Will come back. @realDonaldTrump @FindingAnswers @WhiteHouse @FoxNews #mondaymotivation #maga #TrumpTrain
4136 2018-02-05 19:57:08 @realDonaldTrump Hey, Donald....How's that tanking stock market workin' out for you today? (Political hint: If you claim credit for the historic drops, everyone who's shorted stocks will clap for you.) Please RT @lauferlaw @katwitdown @ColMorrisDavis @DearAuntCrabby @EdKrassen
4137 2018-02-05 19:57:05 He may. Or will he tell the American people that never, has an American president created a better time to get rich. That we all should be buying stocks. We're gonna love it, I can tell you that much.
4138 2018-02-05 19:57:02 Your best definitely. But you need to stop like putting too many stocks and focus on the cleanness of the header if you know what i mean. I like them tho!
4139 2018-02-05 19:56:55 @CNNPolitics  Don't forget to give Trump all the credit for the drop in Stocks today,  & last several  days & how he played a big roll in it.  LOCK TRUMP UP along with his Associates.
4140 2018-02-05 19:56:53 The good news is my stocks are fine, because my stocks are non-existent.
4141 2018-02-05 19:56:46 Stocks are on sale!  You are getting more shares for every  #silverlining
4142 2018-02-05 19:56:39 Read that again.  A 9-year bull market. Common knowledge -- incoming president inherits previous presidents legacy for 1year. Today is almost exactly a year. This is Trump's legacy: US stocks fall 1000 pts in 2 days in extended sell-off.  9-year bull market hitting rough spot.
4143 2018-02-05 19:56:37 Stocks plunge as you speak in Cincinnati!!! You lie and you lie about your lies!
4144 2018-02-05 19:56:34 trump was touting his tax bill as reason for higher stocks for weeks - Can't suddenly walk back now just because market is tanking. He owns this - lock, stock, barrel.  As do all his supporters.
4145 2018-02-05 19:56:32 Watching #Trump speak live. In front of him on my tv screen, as he speaks stupidly the DOW is steadily dropping, falling, he has no idea! He's talking about gaining $1.25 a week more to workers. Big Deal! #stocks r-dropping, stupid! #TrumpDerangementSyndrome

4155 2018-02-05 19:55:52 @realDonaldTrump  Why you not talking about the Stocks now? DOW down an additional 643 points.  
#ThoughtYouShouldKnow
4156 2018-02-05 19:55:52 Everyone is panicking about stocks. We are still flat on a YTD basis and +15%+ YoY. People have forgotten that equities are a risk asset and pullbacks can happen.
4157 2018-02-05 19:55:43 Hey djt the stocks are deplorable
4158 2018-02-05 19:55:42 The rising market was a huge bubble, with stocks tremendously overvalued.  Market analysts call this kind of thing a "correction," but what they mean to say is that "idiots are now losing their shirts."
4159 2018-02-05 19:55:36 The service sector continues to improve. Millennials now outnumber Baby Boomers. Stocks decline after record highs.
4160 2018-02-05 19:55:29 Stocks in the shtter!  Cyrto taking a hit like no other. 
4161 2018-02-05 19:55:24 BREAKING NEWS:  STOCKS CAN ALSO GO DOWN.  Amazing what two straight years of gains can do to people.
4162 2018-02-05 19:55:20 @realDonaldTrump  wow - you are throwing up stocks
4163 2018-02-05 19:55:14 ...and my stocks are going way down
4164 2018-02-05 19:55:12 love clowns like you..gave him no credit for stocks on the way up..sells off 2 days and immediately you start chirping...predictable hypocrisy
4165 2018-02-05 19:55:12 CTAs, risk parity funds dumping stocks and bonds, but the big rise in Treasury bond yields are a boon for pension funds starving for yields.
4166 2018-02-05 19:55:05 Thank Trump for the huge slide in stocks.  Down over 1200 points in two days.

4172 2018-02-05 19:54:03 Tell me about it. Everything is shit at the moment.
Interest rates, stocks, crypto everything is dead
4173 2018-02-05 19:54:03 I'm concerned about this, of course -- not that I, like most Americans, own any stocks. But the thing that's really bothering me is that he's got a glass full of Diet Coke on the Resolute Desk without a coaster. WERE YOU RAISED IN A GOLD-PLATED BARN, YOU MORON? That's OUR desk!

this time, with every asset class correlated the elevator is full
4175 2018-02-05 19:53:58 Ok got some usd firepower ready! 

Are you buying now or waitting to see what happens. Being a dgi investor what u.s stocks are you watching?

 Im intrested in $pg $o $jnj
4176 2018-02-05 19:53:57 This guy is a Trader to our country.   Don't forget to give Trump all the credit for the drop in Stocks today,  & last several  days & how he played a big roll in it.
4177 2018-02-05 19:53:54 So if I buy Stocks in the Traditional Stock Market when it's sales are up and everything is great then it plummets, goes Bankrupt, I don't sell in time, I get to call the bank and get my money back because it's regulated? Wow super cool
4178 2018-02-05 19:53:51 Don't know the reason but cryptos and stocks are both crashing down  together. Some type of panic bottom today or tomorrow is close!
4179 2018-02-05 19:53:46 If I may add to this great thread; when an economy overheats (6.6%) interest rates are raised to reign in spending / inflation. This = better return on ‘safe’ investments (eg savings) and makes holding stocks less attractive. 
Rarely grasped by non-financial (and partisan) media!
4180 2018-02-05 19:53:39 Taking a break from satire here- If you are dis-satisfied with Trump and own stocks or are in a 401K, tell your investor to sell your stocks and invest your money in municipal bonds. Stock market bubble is about to burst.
4181 2018-02-05 19:53:38 I hope Dwights don't think this stocks crash is stopping Black Panther... Y'all got y'all self in this mess, you figure it out

4184 2018-02-05 19:53:22 Let’s see what goes back up the fastest.. BTC or STOCKS
4185 2018-02-05 19:53:17 ** DJ NEWS:  TRUMP SAYS ONLY DEMOCRATS SELL STOCKS, LITTLE ADAM SCHIFF LIKELY CAUSED SELLOFF, BUT IF MARKET DOES KEEP GOING DOWN, WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE HE CALLED STOCK MARKET A BUBBLE IN 2016 SO WAS RIGHT WHETHER IT WENT UP OR DOWN
4186 2018-02-05 19:53:13 The US Markets are correcting and few will take advantage. There may be another 2% drop, but I expect prices to be much higher later to early next week. Sentiment needed to be reset and choas creates opportunity. #stocks #StockMarket #NASDAQ #SP500 #Dow #dowjones
4187 2018-02-05 19:53:12 "The economy is great. The stocks are great." -@realDonaldTrump (while the DOW is 660 points down)

4191 2018-02-05 19:52:53 Ew its getting ugly for stocks lol
4192 2018-02-05 19:52:44 OMG I'm throwing up in my mouth with every word.  Just the same regurgitated lies as usual. And of course NO mention of the stocks crashing. Just more partisan bs. Divide the country more. No unity. Becuase divide and conquer right? The more we argue, the easier their coup is...
4193 2018-02-05 19:52:36 Stocks crashed 100 points since your mouth started spewing lies.
4194 2018-02-05 19:52:34 In last week's episode of @DisruptiveFM I noted all the signs are there for a market correction. The sell off right now is to convert stocks into cash which means many investors think there is a bear market around the corner.
4195 2018-02-05 19:52:23 Bitcoin nears $6,500 while DOW drops nearly 1200 points in 2 days. A bad week for both markets. #Crypto #Stocks

4199 2018-02-05 19:51:39 At this point, stocks have given back January 2018 gains.
4200 2018-02-05 19:51:32 The stock market correction is precipitating the crypto correction (or exacerbating it) at the moment.  We may see fear/panic continue to sell off btc.  Buying opportunity for those who have cash on the sideline...hmm.. maybe those selling stocks/bonds waiting their entry in cryp
4201 2018-02-05 19:51:31 Makes me wonder how much of Bitcoin's bubble was caused by people buying on credit. You can't buy stocks with a credit card for a reason...
4202 2018-02-05 19:51:24 No, people said Obama was the person why the economy was booming and stocks going up, now that's it going down, logically it's Obama fault right? Only make sense
4203 2018-02-05 19:51:21 #stocks are going down as fast as the #cheetoinchief blows his hot air about tax cuts! What a freaking moron he is
4204 2018-02-05 19:51:17 Cryptos and stocks today: So much blood.
4205 2018-02-05 19:51:12 Has he mentioned the stocks are down, of course not. It is incredible the American President acts like this.
4206 2018-02-05 19:51:08 Are Hillary, Comey & McCabe dumping all their stocks before they go to jail? 
Either that or... I'm sure the insiders had this planned all along. Just to make Trump look bad
4207 2018-02-05 19:50:56 Dear @Maga you know all those stocks gains that you claim Trump has created with his Jesus like magic?  Check your portfolio today.  Oh, let me explain.  A portfolio shows you how your investments are divided up, Who am I kidding? you don't have one.
4208 2018-02-05 19:50:48 to whatever extent straight up cash gains value in a market crash, then yeah, definitely. but it is a market crash, not a rally in USD. 

I disagree with you that there isn't an implication. There was a long time when BTC generally went opposite stocks, kinda like gold. No longer
4209 2018-02-05 19:50:47 VIX up 47.0% today. That short position is crushing the short sellers. I hope it bankrupts them. They are selling stocks to raise cash. Run for cover.
4210 2018-02-05 19:50:26 No, just observing that while levels & magnitude of the market rally/ rise in yields are much different today, there are directional similarities.  Stocks have been melting up while rates are rising and the dollar is falling. Last week’s correction may even negate the ’87 analog.
4211 2018-02-05 19:50:25 Maybe they can put all of their $1.50's in the stock market now that the stocks are falling
4212 2018-02-05 19:50:21 Heres my spitballing prediction: 

Stocks crash, major bailout (lets say GE for shits n giggles), people dump fiat and debt (not all for BTC but at least rises in volume)
4213 2018-02-05 19:50:15 Gotta give the #GOP and #Trump credit with their #taxreform and expertise in the #economy. Look at #stocks take a #plunge 
Maybe its time to reconsider having the king of #bankuptcy as our #POTUS
4214 2018-02-05 19:50:06 Stocks gonna crash huge
4215 2018-02-05 19:50:00 CNNMoney: The Dow is down 600 points. Stocks are at their lows for the day.
4216 2018-02-05 19:49:59 Yeeeeessss!!!! More stocks please!!!
4217 2018-02-05 19:49:59 Stocks crashing. Is that what you mean?
4218 2018-02-05 19:49:46 Really? My stocks are taking a beating since last week!
4219 2018-02-05 19:49:37 ...2.. since it was written on groups letterhead.... so that investors who want to be away from political stocks like #TVtoday network knows before investing ... #hdfcsmallcapfund #steinbergindia emerging opportunities fund #Rameshdamani
4220 2018-02-05 19:49:34 We're approaching -600 points on the DOW. This is more than the market bubble bursting - it is corporate America selling off stocks, with some help from the wealthy. "Why is that?" you ask. THEY SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL. #NeedtoImpeach? Imminent. Resignation? Very likely!
4221 2018-02-05 19:49:31 Yes, it is true the markets may fluctuate, and unless you are a FoxNews viewer, uncomfortable with you know, *facts*, you will believe President* aka David Dennison when he claims credit for stocks going up while simultaneously believing he has nothing to do with them going down.
4222 2018-02-05 19:49:19 I think the big companies want to buy back their stocks with their tax windfall,so they are figuring ways to dump the price before buyback.
4223 2018-02-05 19:48:57 Trump: LOOK AT THE STOCK MARKET LOOK HOW AMAZING IT IS THE ECONOMY IS STRONG BECAUSE STOCKS

[Stock market tanks]

Trump: What's a stock market?
4224 2018-02-05 19:48:51 Lows of the day for US stocks...Dow now -600 pts
4225 2018-02-05 19:48:43 The market will recover. You can't have such a huge rise is price without some correction. Once this mass sell off ends the price all come back up.

What are you doing in the current market.

4237 2018-02-05 19:47:45 takes TONS of discipline! not round tripping this shyte...Fck that. they move so much you can time it. Its not like the stocks 5% is a big move. my whole thing is just consistently make the pile grow and wait for set ups...now-.BTC has a low probability bullish set up for a while
4238 2018-02-05 19:47:41 Do you think the mining stocks will wake up soon?
4239 2018-02-05 19:47:40 You’re wrong on this as well. Stocks are selling off because they have finished pricing in a near-term kicker to growth from the tax cuts.
4240 2018-02-05 19:47:02 US stocks are tanking by more than 2% for the second straight day: $DJIA -570, $SPX -55 with 75mins left in the trading day
4241 2018-02-05 19:46:58 I'm investing in cannabis stocks thinking how much will they be worth in 5-10 years when it replaces pain killers and big pharma gets involved. I could not care less what happens between now and then. It will be volatile, we will have up days down days.
4242 2018-02-05 19:46:38 1200 point sell off of stocks- u own it now!
4243 2018-02-05 19:46:37 I don’t think the bubble’s popping. Bond yields are high so people are pulling out of stocks and investing elsewhere. This compounds with a fear of higher borrowing rates. I don’t think it’s a correction, yet.
4244 2018-02-05 19:46:35 Crypto world in real trouble right now, stocks dropping left & right
4245 2018-02-05 19:46:28 Seems a bit beneath you. BTC is going down hard while stocks have two down days. This is your argument for correlation?
4246 2018-02-05 19:46:26 Reuters: BREAKING NEWS:U.S. stocks extend fall, Dow Jones down more than 500 points. I prefer #BTC
4247 2018-02-05 19:46:23 The stocks and all the cryptocurrencies and falling like a motherfucker. Wtf goin on?
4248 2018-02-05 19:46:11 Perpetuating a cultural artifact is also problematic though.

Again im not saying you should be thrown in the stocks. But especially when one of the most well received articles this decade in Magic is a pro player talking about depression, it might be wise to not make that joke.
4249 2018-02-05 19:45:57 Wow, stocks now incredibly cheap under @realDonaldTrump -- #StableGenius is running the economy now!
4250 2018-02-05 19:45:04 I have no idea whether #stocks will bounce here. All I know is that if they do bounce, its better to do so late in the day to catch the shorts and sellers leaning.
4251 2018-02-05 19:44:57 BREAKING: #Stocks $DIA Dow Jones industrial average drops 500 points, nearing 25,000 and erasing the gains it has made over the last month
4252 2018-02-05 19:44:49 @realDonaldTrump  Dow drops 500 points as stocks fall; Wells Fargo plunges - Hope Trump is taking responsibility for the Trump Stock Market Crash - First we had Trump Black Friday Now Trump Black Monday
4253 2018-02-05 19:44:32 Of the stocks I follow, only a few are green, notably $VFC and $PCLN.  I guess people think there will still be a need for jeans and vacations.
4254 2018-02-05 19:44:14 So, of course, the way the timing of these things always works - I move my retirement funds contributions around to include more risk (i.e., stocks) and the market immediately goes south.
4255 2018-02-05 19:43:42 Meanwhile while $vrg $btc $xpr #DJIA is getting bent over $NGMC and other #OTC stocks ar racking it in.
4256 2018-02-05 19:43:24 I just don't understand how someone can do this ,it breaks my heart .A police caution  is a joke ,bring back the public stocks 
4257 2018-02-05 19:43:23 Keine Begrüßung nach Maß für den neuen #Fed-Chef: heute ist Jay Powell den 1. Tag im Amt an der Spitze der US Notenbank.... #stocks, #WallStreet, #CentralBanks
4258 2018-02-05 19:43:20 My stocks are taking a dive. Markets crap today. Meh..
4259 2018-02-05 19:43:16 How is $snap, of all stocks, pulling off being in the green today.
4260 2018-02-05 19:43:16 Two blow outs in less than 5 minutes with the same kid? Yep. Our family is the reason @Costco stocks some many diapers! #paysformembership #200bucksamonth #donationsaccepted
4261 2018-02-05 19:43:15 Will never understand anyone going to his “rallies”, clapping, like it’s a deal or that 45 is anything more then a blowheart, gross lying criminal.  Astounding!  Don’t care how much your stocks went up. #DotardinChief
4262 2018-02-05 19:43:12 I’ve lost 6% of my 401K and 4.5% on my Scottrade investments in less than 48 hours. Thankfully my Scottrade stuff is up 400% over the past 4 years (mostly airline stocks).
4263 2018-02-05 19:43:09 Do you pay attention to stocks? Btw it’s still the best it’s been. Nice try #snowflake. 
4264 2018-02-05 19:43:06 I also believe $IZEA is undervalued but lately it's been down due to the bitcoin crash. Many companies' stocks that are related to crypto went down. That was my point. Not saying $IZEA will crash just because of bitcoin 
4265 2018-02-05 19:43:04 sorry when was it closed?  because stocks were high before he was elected. Apple was still Apple, Amazong, Google.. etc
4266 2018-02-05 19:42:53 It is such a drastically over-inflated bubble with ridiculous numbers and was done so with CEOs borrowing money to buy back their own stocks to keep values up, plus the Feds insane money printing for 8 years of the last administration--all built on an absurdly amount of debt
4267 2018-02-05 19:42:36 Boom
You’re right. I’m a big old softie. I tend to think in terms of what can happen, rather than what I’d like to see happen.

5 days in stocks in the public square, 100 lashes and then tarred and feathered wouldn’t be too good for them while we’re at it.

Hot tar can kill!
4268 2018-02-05 19:42:30 Wfc has much higher chance of going to $1 and taking down stocks, those money will flow to crypto
4269 2018-02-05 19:42:24 This is crappy, but kind of par for the course in most retail environments. My former employer had the same kind of autostock system to fill out of stocks, and it was also a nightmare.
4270 2018-02-05 19:42:11 So much winning under @realDonaldTrump the #dow cant handle it anymore

#DowJones #stocks #USA #DonaldTrumpJr
4271 2018-02-05 19:42:04 Oh boy. Stocks up for 52 weeks, one down and let’s get frightened. Evelyn, you need to get real. On the tax scam, please don’t accept the extra money in your paycheck. Please donate it back to the treasury. None of you Dems live by your words. Ever. People like you are the scam.
4272 2018-02-05 19:42:02 Stocks at session lows,crypto is what negative thinkers choose to focus on...
4273 2018-02-05 19:42:02 tq, hope lawsuit is filed bc I dont see anything stopping this rule change. CA DOJ can do as they want like the ATF is doing w/bump stocks and "rate increasing devices"
4274 2018-02-05 19:41:38 Really happy I held out of #Bitcoin when it seemed that $10k was a bargain. Really fucking bummed I didn’t sell stocks earlier tho #dead
4275 2018-02-05 19:40:55 Stocks doing bad, crypto doing bad. Can't depend on nothing but this hustle.
4276 2018-02-05 19:40:47 Stocks declining already today after a rough week last week.  #ThanksObama
4277 2018-02-05 19:40:47 I pulled my 94yr old Aunt out of stocks in Dec due 2 political instability, and her broker dude made fun of me. Parked it in CDs til things calm down. Wanna call him today to gloat.
I know nothing about $$, so lucky to dodge bullet.
4278 2018-02-05 19:40:43 people are selling stocks to buy bonds since the interest rate is up, this is not a problem it's smart selling/buying.
4279 2018-02-05 19:40:28 My new lotto $ppje #Lotto #stocks #current #float All my comments are opinion based.
4280 2018-02-05 19:40:10 Another theory: BTC algos entered NYSE market and now trading stocks ...
4281 2018-02-05 19:40:04 Who's selling off there stocks? Why are they selling there stocks? Hum? They own the market too? Hang tight everyone. Let them sell. Evil!
4282 2018-02-05 19:40:03 Don't you love how Buffett is showing his true colors? I can understand the others but Buffett? Goes to show that he was involved in more than trading stocks
4283 2018-02-05 19:39:59 This could be the perfect storm... world stocks falling and a low btc price for salvation.
4284 2018-02-05 19:39:54 The other good news this time is you can make 2% in short term liquid cash as stocks do their momentum thing
4285 2018-02-05 19:39:45 This is what happens when retail is all in on stocks and bitcoin.  Haven't seen a stock market like this since 2000.  Big volatility is how tops are formed.
4286 2018-02-05 19:39:01 I literally just saw someone defend trump, saying that even if the stocks hit $0, they'll support the greatest president ever...

I fear for our future :(
4287 2018-02-05 19:38:54 US stocks go over another cliff, and are now down almost 2.2%, or 550 points, following on from a dip of 2.6% last Friday. Will the coiffured sex pest take credit?
4288 2018-02-05 19:38:38 President Trump must be short stocks.
4289 2018-02-05 19:38:34 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are down! you going to take credit for that?
4290 2018-02-05 19:38:08 Pretty shit thing to say, was heavy cash as of 2h last year for this reason! 

Been dipping in & out of stocks but never more than 50% equities 

All well documented
4291 2018-02-05 19:37:58 Regime Change?

Number of Times S&P was Down TOGETHER with Bonds*

2010s: 0
2000s: 3
1990s: 3
1980s: 19
1970s: 24

*Three weeks in A Row stocks and bonds selling off together
4292 2018-02-05 19:37:41 Global stocks are in free fall. Of course, Trump will ignore this.
4293 2018-02-05 19:37:39 Has anyone noticed that since the SOTU address,  that stocks have plummeted badly.  Let's see what the POTUS has to say about that
4294 2018-02-05 19:37:39 Stocks following up on Friday's big losses.. Right now the Dow Jones is down 560 points.. dropping below 25,000 and erasing the gains it has made over the last month #StockMarket
4295 2018-02-05 19:37:32 #DowJones verliert über 500 Punkte, Ölpreis schließt ebenfalls 2% tiefer in NY; #stocks, #WallStreet, #OilPrice, #Commodities
4296 2018-02-05 19:37:28 My new sleep aid is to watch YouTube videos about stocks Lol. I’ve finally been able to fall asleep at a decent time 
4297 2018-02-05 19:37:20 tbh the reason we don’t teach kids about taxes and stocks and insurance and stuff is because we adults don’t fully understand it ourselves.
4298 2018-02-05 19:37:20 My stocks were wrecked today. Thanks Obama!
4299 2018-02-05 19:37:09 Stress is one variable that messes investors up. What causes this stress? Indecision. What causes Indecision? Not knowing what to do. Thru study, you develop RULES to guide you. #stocks
4300 2018-02-05 19:37:02 Kinda of a slow morning stocks moving slow bitcoin down
4301 2018-02-05 19:37:01 Stocks are falling right after you proved to the world that you DONT even like Murca by #ReleaseTheMemoNONSENSE, just politicising the people who protect you, now the crash and inflation is thanks to people who reward welfare checks to billionaires! STOCKS DIVING ALL YOU!
4302 2018-02-05 19:37:00 Only 6% of stocks above 10 day sma
4303 2018-02-05 19:36:55 Stocks dropping for the same reason they rose -- none.
4304 2018-02-05 19:36:48 Such sharp correction reminds me event base promotions where same products u get at least 25% cheaper! Fundamental didn’t change but suddenly certain stocks got corrected by 25%, I was just waiting 4 such opportunity to increase my allocation! Will do some shopping in dis week!
4305 2018-02-05 19:36:36 bonds are bid, stocks down big but gold is doing nothing.
4306 2018-02-05 19:36:15 stocks are falling because stocks are falling
4307 2018-02-05 19:36:14 @GregMannarino Greg, bond buying don't seem to be helping stocks..  We may be at the point you've talked about for a long time.
4308 2018-02-05 19:35:56 The world markets are all down , gas , oil , Bitcoin and Bonds too. Usually when stocks are down the bond yields go up. CNBC says "something strange" is going on.....More sellers than buyers today , so downward trend may continue. Wage and interest rate increases are factors...
4309 2018-02-05 19:35:47 Fuck stocks I’m going back to real estate 
4310 2018-02-05 19:35:21 Moving from stocks to bonds. Take that gain :)
4311 2018-02-05 19:35:20 Go to Stock market page other countries stocks are going down as well
4312 2018-02-05 19:35:05 Stocks tumbling, Dow now -520, Nasdaq -101
4313 2018-02-05 19:34:54 I'm sure they made a huge McDonald stock purchase and before they sell those stocks they want to make sure they're high enough. 
4314 2018-02-05 19:34:52 #DowJones Plunge  under 25000 $DJA -2.03% $SPY -1.80% $NDQ -1.20%
#market #stocks #economy #risingyield #pullback
4315 2018-02-05 19:34:40 And the source for sudden volatility is the US Treasury, which in January was selling debt at a pace approaching $1 trillion every four weeks, which weakened the $DXY and boosted rates, prep for the debt ceiling. Dollar volatility is a Ring of Fire for stocks.
4316 2018-02-05 19:34:32 #BREAKING #DowJones drops over 500 points, loses over 1000 points in two days $DJI $DJIA as stocks selloff continues
4317 2018-02-05 19:34:31 Look at those stocks fall... damn it
4318 2018-02-05 19:34:24 Also: "Guy on TV told me Trump so great we can buy stocks at any price and not go down."
4319 2018-02-05 19:34:11 Globalists selling off stocks
4320 2018-02-05 19:33:59 My stocks were doing great but after Friday and today they aren’t looking so good... #savethedow
4321 2018-02-05 19:33:51 Woah- DIJA does not look good and getting worse, over -2% and still dropping
S&P TSX - 0.98%
Looks like $WEED stocks holding up healthcare.
Materials hanging in there. 
The rest is red.
4322 2018-02-05 19:33:43 Wall St liberals are selling stocks to make Trump look bad. We must nationalize the banks NOW.
4323 2018-02-05 19:33:30 a) That is a bit different as you short specific stocks that you think are overvalued relative to their price.
b)They don't advertise it on twitter making dems look like they are gloating about stocks going down. It is not a good look for dems.
4324 2018-02-05 19:33:28 $Uvxy looks like it wants 20 today
4325 2018-02-05 19:33:12 I’m worried about the stock market but also too poor to have stocks
4326 2018-02-05 19:33:07 Trump's prolly selling all his stocks for cash to go into hiding in Russia.
4327 2018-02-05 19:33:00 @realDonaldTrump Why don't you buy up all those cheap stocks and save the market from your economic disaster, Mr Moneybags? #fakebillionaire
4328 2018-02-05 19:32:54 Everything playing out in great harmony with @JamesGRickards, @PeterSchiff ideas over the last few months for sure.  At which point is the market decline 'disorderly' in the new FEDs eyes and what should that mean for Gold and stocks like @Goldmoney and Gold miners?
4329 2018-02-05 19:32:21 . MAGATS be like, “I’m making so much in my stocks.”  I be like, “the stock market is based on speculation and everyone speculates a crooked prez will make them lots of money so, yeah, good luck with that gamble.”  Can’t wait to see them all lose their money!!!
4330 2018-02-05 19:32:13 Half a year. Crypto moves faster than stocks so newbs will be promoted earlier.
4331 2018-02-05 19:32:11 STOCKS DIPPING BELOW 25,000,FOLKS
4332 2018-02-05 19:32:10 I really hope you are all buying down your positions in #StockMarket  or if you are creating new positions make sure you create no more than 25% of a position. Watch the #Market and add to any new position over the next few weeks until you build to where you want to be. #stocks

4336 2018-02-05 19:31:12 Meanwhile stocks continued to crash
4337 2018-02-05 19:30:57 Suddenly Janet is giving interviews saying that stocks and real estate are over-valued. Odd.

4341 2018-02-05 19:30:14 I feel better somehow. Of course I don’t have stocks. Or retirement. Proud member of the 50% of Americans. Gulp. 
4342 2018-02-05 19:30:12 He has made me 25% on my stocks since election.  I bet your friend Crooked Hillary wouldn't come close!
4343 2018-02-05 19:30:11 DOW stocks keep crossing the 500 point as they plunge for a second business day. They plunged 666 points on Friday. Will @realDonaldTrump acknowledge?
4344 2018-02-05 19:30:09 ..only humble brags on twitter and after the fact buy/sells.  But seriously, there are good stocks that everyone can safely hold and the rest are just trades (a very personal thing, based on your finances, mood and a billion other factors).  Don't trade angry! or on tilt!
4345 2018-02-05 19:30:07 .@MemphiSeagrove, Many technical traders consider “Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets” by John J. Murphy, a good book on the subject. For investing, “The intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham, & “How to make money in Stocks” by William O’Neil, are both good sources.

4353 2018-02-05 19:28:23 Overheard an old man on the Max to PDX saying loudly if the stock markets crash, war will start cuz money will make a man for it. I wanted to say my cousin got her stocks free thanks to her company and she don't care about U.S. one way or other. She already rich.
4354 2018-02-05 19:27:36 Every time I type and Google and see the stocks, I think of Coach Stovall’s class
4355 2018-02-05 19:27:31 Stocks gettin hammered.  Pumped, ready to buy in again!
4356 2018-02-05 19:27:28 Whatever you do, don't put it in the Trump inflated stock market. Taking bets on which will crash first, stocks or the Trump misadministration.
4357 2018-02-05 19:26:59 Dow drops 500 points!

4363 2018-02-05 19:25:51 I'm still learning the ropes of crypto. I've metal ed in metals and stocks in the past.
4364 2018-02-05 19:25:47 I know most people forgot what volatility was like. But yes it still exists. Markets seem to be functioning in a healthy way, it was abnormal to be up 9 of 10 days, so you have to give some back. #stocks
4365 2018-02-05 19:25:46 watch ticker BND, new fed chairman. If they won't start buying up bonds it's game over for stocks.
4366 2018-02-05 19:25:38 After last year there is going to be a pretty sever stock price correction. Stocks have vastly over priced for the last few months. Fed is going to raise rates to slow market down and 10 t notes starting to hit 3% doesn't help.
4367 2018-02-05 19:25:29 I'm trading both and it feels like stocks are pulling bitcoin even lower

4375 2018-02-05 19:23:44 We, the over 65's, are a burden on society. Rich beyond the younger generation's dreams. What DO we contribute towards the state of the nation? State pension, private pension, stocks and shares ... sheer greed on our part. Compulsory euthanasia for OAPs! Have a nice day @Matthew
4376 2018-02-05 19:23:32 @realDonaldTrump Is this also the result of your #winning ? Guess this is 100% your fault just like it was when stocks went up #LiarInChief
4377 2018-02-05 19:23:21 Stocks soar 40% after Trump election.  

MSM - yawn!  

Stocks tumble 4% last two days

MSM - The sky is falling.
4378 2018-02-05 19:22:41 Not a big deal. I bought 2 stocks in January as well. But they still had good value and we play the long term game. Will even itself out.

4380 2018-02-05 19:22:22 @DemolitionRanch Hey! You should do a video on bump stocks. If you never used one, I think you will be pretty supprized how much it works. And I know its a controversial topic so if you dont want to because of that thats cool. But you can educate people about it so do it.
4381 2018-02-05 19:22:22 Anyone who's invested in crypto or stocks, these past couple days hurt.

4383 2018-02-05 19:21:54 It's unclear what you think my opinion is.  I think ylds will be allowed to back up to a politically-acceptable level & then be pinned by CB's.  I think CPI will be rptd to be whatever level doesn't indict that CB yld pin; IMO this will take USD down & stocks up, big
4384 2018-02-05 19:21:41 So... a democrat walk into a room where cnn was on and the stocks took a nose dive? That's it, I'm sure.

4387 2018-02-05 19:20:06 @USTreasury, you may owe US stock investors an apology. At Dec 1 Treasury auctions had a 4wk running average of $630 billion. By Jan 12, it had soared to $889 billion, weakening dollar, lifting rates, rocking stocks. Bulking up ahead of debt ceiling?
4388 2018-02-05 19:20:06 It’s ok though stocks are a thing where I just leave money and don’t care about ups and downs much. Whenever there is a huge surge or I need the money, I sell. I sometimes wait long times though. (Don’t invest much)
4389 2018-02-05 19:20:05 $SPY Big volume today. I think we'll bottom here about the 50dma of 2717, a good benchmark. Forget 200dma - tax bill made it irrelevant (for awhile) as most stocks became worth 5%-25% more in December. Outlook for most stocks is still very bullish.

4399 2018-02-05 19:17:36 Stocks down heavily.  

Trump's fault . Day 2 of a correction.

4405 2018-02-05 19:16:42 Do they? Many Pot Stocks quickly rejected their 50 SMA today.
4406 2018-02-05 19:16:16 Fact: Bitcoin has been the safest asset in which to park savings over the last 8 years. Safer than gold, stocks, almost all commodities and cash. Expect that pattern to continue over the next decade.
4407 2018-02-05 19:16:11 US stocks continue to slide, on the way to a 10-20% correction. The question of the day: will the price deflation spill over to other asset markets?Europe and Japan equities already feeling the heat. Are junk bonds next? Emerging markets bloodbath coming.

4415 2018-02-05 19:12:48 Yet once again you've managed to ignore another school shooting because you take your orders from the NRA & they are anti reasonable gun ownership/background check/training laws.  Bump stocks? Still legal cause you are afraid of NRA. You're a coward IRL -bone spur man.

4420 2018-02-05 19:11:43 the market drop feels worse at the index level... when i check stocks that i would like to buy on a pullback, they're still not on sale.
4421 2018-02-05 19:11:34 I think it's time to start making a distinction between "CryptoCurrencies" and "ICO's", AKA Virtual Stocks.

Lumping everything together into the same nomenclature, is causing more confusion among new users, investors, and regulators.  They are not the same thing

4425 2018-02-05 19:11:18 Crypto is not all that different from a lot of "normal" stocks. As far as them bring legit busines. I always replace crypto with US stocks when I see statements like this.

4433 2018-02-05 19:08:35 Not sure there's much to bet on.  Yields will not get out of control to the upside IMO.  Reported inflation will not become unanchored to the upside, IMO.  Stocks won't be allowed to fall substantially b/c they r the key to preventing a fiscal problem, per both Greenspan & Yellen

I mean, not that bad, but acknowledging privilege then talking about how unprivileged you were is not acknowledging!
4468 2018-02-05 18:59:13 Stocks prices are inflated. Just a little correction. They will have to lose another 1 to 2000 points for the DOW to settle down.

4476 2018-02-05 18:57:50 Here’s what I think is going on with the economy.. there’s a group of grease balls betting on stocks as our media pushes troubled nonsense about trump and continues to confuse America on what’s right with throwing fits about pussy hats just cause money talks and bullshit walks
4477 2018-02-05 18:57:11 Volatility is the cost of entry to owning stocks. For a short period of time, that fee got waived. Now it's time to collect.
4478 2018-02-05 18:57:00 It's silly. 100% agree. If you are buying stocks just because people are talking about them on Twitter, you may not be fit for managing your own investments. No one is on here selling advice (I think?). And yes, some people have hidden agendas. Welcome to the world!
4479 2018-02-05 18:56:58 Where low quality stocks on AIM really suffer in a market correction is their access to funding through placing shares completely dries up. In a bull market, selling shares is often the reason for their existence. Their shares get crushed when momentum traders head for hills.
4480 2018-02-05 18:56:52 The day after Trump won we called our fin. advisor and moved everything into low risk. Still made plenty of $. I don't own a lot of US stocks.  But I do have a lot of cash to buy low when it really dives.

4483 2018-02-05 18:56:41 This is just the beginning, he rode the high stocks wave from his predecessor, but obviously the DJ is so incompetent that holding the economic booming trend was impossible for him to keep it. RECESSION is here and Govmt SHUTDOWN is next.  Welcome trickle down taxes.
4484 2018-02-05 18:56:41 Most stocks have been at their 52 week highs so a correction was in order.  It the concern on interest rates and inflation is something to watch.

4503 2018-02-05 18:52:31 Mr Market seems not to like your strategy. Or are stocks down b/c of the Nunes memo? Either way, things not looking as rosy today as this time last week. It was only a matter of time. Sad!

4506 2018-02-05 18:52:14 @morningmika The only thing worse than taking over an economy that's tanked is taking over one that is nearly topped out. There's no gas left in the tank! Most people have zero savings, med. insurance premiums are going up, & stocks P/E ratios R maxed out. What will fuel growth?

 the reversal day was the Jan.16,2018. Stocks recovered & went to new all time high; all averages except DJUA on Jan 26. Levitated for several days, then irreversible reversal to downside occurred on Feb. 2,18. Reminds me of the Soviet-German War of 1941-45. Will see.
4515 2018-02-05 18:50:11 Don't forget corp reinvestment. Selling stocks to upgrade is what I see on a local level.

4538 2018-02-05 18:45:53 Stocks are "on sale" today, sure, but no one knows whether discounts will end or deepen tomorrow or next week.

Whatever the market does, one can often do well with dollar cost averaging: schedule to use a fixed amount of money to buy into the market at a fixed interval of time.
4539 2018-02-05 18:45:45 Yeah and if John Kasay doesn’t kick the kickoff out of bounds Carolina beats NE. It’s a team game!

4557 2018-02-05 18:42:38 But companies banned crypto purchases and are okay with stocks. They're scared asf cause they know what's to come

And penny stocks can be just as volatile as crypto so volatility has nothing to do with it

4595 2018-02-05 18:35:45 Lots of penny stocks have pulled back to their 21-day EMAs as of today .. follow the indexes, could be a nice spot to start buying if sentiment changes and markets turn up.
4596 2018-02-05 18:35:43 However, with stocks making new lows the message to me is that the responsible actor is a dangerous shift in the market's structure - fully discussed in this morning's two part opening missive - that is determining market price action.
4597 2018-02-05 18:35:31 @TSTRealMoneyPro  Interestingly the yield on the ten year US note is at the day's lows - at 2.823%, its three basis points lower this afternoon.

If stocks were moving lower (Friday and today) only because of higher interest rates - stocks would have likely stabilized today.
4598 2018-02-05 18:35:28 funny thing will happen when #Bitcoin recovers again from a 70% #cryptocrash and the #stocks won't survive 10 % correction :)
4599 2018-02-05 18:35:23 DOW JONES is current 420 points down today, following a 666 point loss Friday, starting to feel like stocks are fake and somebody is fucking with me.

4606 2018-02-05 18:34:26 Prospects that Trump's new Fed chair is about to raise interest rates at the exact same time the GOP is blowing open a new, unanticipated spree of $1 trillion in debt means the market is going to shift back from stocks to bonds.
4607 2018-02-05 18:34:25 Wow. The stock market has plunged over 1000 points in only 3 business days!  Dummy Donald is going for another record! Can he get us to a massive recession quicker than George W. Bush did? Only time will tell.

4608 2018-02-05 18:34:18 Stocks look less attractive right now bc the low unemployment rate is finally making employee salaries creep up... less profit for companies... less dividends to stockholders.

Meaning fewer people buy stocks, stock prices fall,  markets get scared, people start selling stocks.

4620 2018-02-05 18:32:04 I think you could also include as a factor treasury note rates going up as more of the fed budget is funded by borrowing than taxes. The debt ceiling has already been accelrared by a month. That will pull some $ from stocks to bonds.

4624 2018-02-05 18:31:36 Where do you get the 31%? Looking at a graph that shows Dow steadily rising far before Trump. Anyway he wants us to beeline the stock market is the economy and I’m afraid his base do beeline him though they probably don’t have huge stocks, just as a side note.

4628 2018-02-05 18:31:18 Just typed 'Is cryptocurrency...' into Google and first 2 options are 'legal in India and 'Halal'. Was going type 'like stocks'. Seems it is and it isn't. Based on demand for pure currency rather than any business performance. This thing has legs.

4655 2018-02-05 18:26:49 The only pillar Trump could try to leverage as a "win" for him as president has finally reached its breaking point. When the economy fails the last 30% that support Trump will bail. While stocks is not the economy it was giving the illusion the economy was flourishing.

4665 2018-02-05 18:25:16 With banks, health care and energy companies sinking, stocks are taking steeper losses Monday. The S&P 500 has fallen more than 5% since its latest record close on Jan. 26.

4667 2018-02-05 18:24:44 Stocks aren't economy.
4668 2018-02-05 18:24:27 Hasn't FED been buying the best stocks? If the continue to do so couldn't they stop best market from occurring?
4669 2018-02-05 18:24:18 Interest rate track utilities index, stock has inverse relationship with interest rate. You can actually monitor stocks behavior by track  mortgage and car loans interest rate.
4670 2018-02-05 18:24:04 The time to buy or become a passive investor is now...as the stocks tumble... They will only go up soon
4671 2018-02-05 18:24:02 You mean stocks can go down, too?
4672 2018-02-05 18:23:44 While we suspect market weakness could persist in the near term, we continue to believe #stocks are well supported by strong #fundamentals, expect gains over the rest of 2018, and maintain our fair value S&P 500 range of 2850-2900. #SPX
4673 2018-02-05 18:22:59 The market losses are a little unsettling. Makes me wonder if the stocks are falling because of an overly hot economy is the tax stimulus to blame.
4674 2018-02-05 18:22:55 I'm not the guy in the video.

4681 2018-02-05 18:21:35 So are people getting margin called out of stocks and having to sell BTC for liquidity or vice versa?

4683 2018-02-05 18:21:25 Stocks getting decimated again sending a clear signal to the Fed. that it does not like rates here... Will the Fed. be forced to reverse it monetary policy of more rate hikes? We shall see.

It's not really going to be a surprise when the interest returns to SX later this year. Eric Salsberg has a slightly higher "price target" than $2, I think it's fair to speculate.

4693 2018-02-05 18:19:36 "FTSE 100 hits two-month low, and Dow slides as market sell-off continues -as it happened." For anyone "nervous" about #Crypto, lots of Stocks have been doing similar things as #Bitcoin. And guess what, they rebound. US stocks are down 1 Trillion.

4704 2018-02-05 18:17:59 @realDonaldTrump I hope the stocks don't continue to go down. Checked my investments and they don't look good. They were growing before this tax cut.
4705 2018-02-05 18:17:58 Why does no one try to figure why prices at the grocery store drop or consider a problem. But, stocks go on sale and Katie bar the door. If you think its never going back up then sale, if you dont then things are on sale and buy!
4706 2018-02-05 18:17:51 Hey @realDonaldTrump It's time you owned up to this as much as you've taken credit for it's rise. =1000 pts cannot be ignored. It's on you no matter what you think. Stocks go down, companies will cut back, jobs trimmed or lost. What's YOUR solution?
4707 2018-02-05 18:17:50 I just got off a call some advisor saying “gimme some talking points I have a 50/50 client (half stocks / half bonds) getting really nervous”.  I told them go ahead move to cash if it makes them feel better.  Let their own intuition guide them and you just keep charging a fee

4715 2018-02-05 18:16:09 Stocks plummeting, S&P -4.7% from high. Vix soaring. Oh, and Bitcoin below $7,000. But the 10-year yield is now down on the day, and gold is finally finding a bid.

RE stocks dance to different tunes.
Reality of realty stocks is a mirage.
4729 2018-02-05 18:13:54 Dow has been inflated by QE money. Dow is going to come down. It's 30 inflated stocks, and that is all it is. It is not the economic indicator that is has been made out to be. Many of the companies in the Dow don't own much more than a server farm.

4735 2018-02-05 18:12:44 If the Fed says there is an asset bubble, in housing, in bonds, in stocks, the market will sell. If investors believe the Fed is worried about higher wages leading to higher inflation, and therefore higher interest rates, you get a double-whammy hitting the S&P 500.

4737 2018-02-05 18:12:26 Does it matter?  Everyone on twitter has been out of both stocks and bitcoin for days, they all managed to sell at the top and now just biding their time to jump back in at the bottom.
4738 2018-02-05 18:12:21 Agreed that BTC is new. For sure. But let's both store some of our value. You in gold. Me in BTC. In 3 years, who will have better stored their inputted value? Philosophical Q: what's a store of value. Stocks? Real estate? Waiting until BTC is stable misses the opportunity.

But I wonder about $GES.  6% div. yield w/ a less than stellar payout ratio.  It is up today in this market (Dead cat bounce?). 200 Day MA is 14.12%.  Worth a buy here?

4756 2018-02-05 18:04:58 @SullyCNBC @GuyAdami Hate to say it No bottom in stocks till Bitcoin stop making new lows!!
4757 2018-02-05 18:04:53 Completely agree which is why I am dollar cost averaging my way through this buying opportunity. Investors with only an emotional connection and no analytical conviction regarding their stocks are prone to panic when the herd runs...
4758 2018-02-05 18:04:37 Global sell off of stocks, stocks continue to drop. Trump / GOP tax scam can't fool the market

4762 2018-02-05 18:03:41 Stocks are tanking...not unexpected after how well they’ve been doing but has President T had any responses yet? He was convinced the rise in stocks was all because of him...what about the bad?
4763 2018-02-05 18:03:20 Let me spell it out for you and then I'm moving on. No civilian IMO needs an assult weapon. No one needs bump stocks. We stop the assult weapons/attachments capable of mass shootings, the mass murders will drop drastically. It won't stop killings, but would slow mass shootings
4764 2018-02-05 18:02:58 that’s right - no reason to be worried -yet- it was overheated, the fed gov employees moving their assets around triggered the first decline, now the so called ‘wanna-be-investors’ started to sell off their stocks because the software they use for trade shows a ‘sell’ alarm
4765 2018-02-05 18:02:54 $Uvxy up up
4766 2018-02-05 18:02:45 Yes, exactly what disaster capitalists want.  Brexit will cause a recession, stocks down, business suffer, jobs go, tax take down and disaster capitalists move in and buy... the bigger the down turn the more they profit in long run.  Where does the money come from?
4767 2018-02-05 18:02:27 Flattening, steepening, stocks rally, sell-off, inflation, deflation, political risks, political stability - we've seen it all in recent quarters.
So here's my question to goldbugs - what on earth are we waiting for exactly for gold prices to spike the way you preach they will?!?
4768 2018-02-05 18:02:10 Should hire a crew & go into geese poop fertilizer stocks.

So stocks or gold/silver and traders are all ponzi?
4780 2018-02-05 17:58:15 That's like getting a HEL to invest in stocks. No bueno.
4781 2018-02-05 17:58:15 they weren't so junk a month ago when they were up 30-50% from where I bought them,  and these are long-term holds, I check them quarterly. Energy stocks in general trading at multi-year lows relative to oil and can re-rate by 30% easily here without oil needing to even move.
4782 2018-02-05 17:56:57 All Nifty Pharma stocks are giving bullish signal here. Yeah, I am back on screen.

4792 2018-02-05 17:50:45 A) there are absolutely stocks that appreciated more than 60% in 2017. B) return on derivative investments can absolutely beat 60% return. c) can you fundamentally point to something and explain why these movements happen with Bitcoin? Up and downs?
4793 2018-02-05 17:50:11 If you missed buying some cannabis stocks this morning, you might get a second dip in a few. MIGHT.
4794 2018-02-05 17:50:00 Actually this is pretty crap news. There was even a piece from GS to that effect demonstrating it's the steepening that kills stocks, historically.
4795 2018-02-05 17:49:59 Last week, stocks had their worst performance in two years. Can you fix that?
4796 2018-02-05 17:49:37 My stocks are down. It’s not a good day.
4797 2018-02-05 17:49:33 Let me know what you think.
4798 2018-02-05 17:49:28 Months ago when Trump, Jr, & @EricTrump were talking up the stock market as if they had invented rallies, I noted that it reminded me of the shoe shine boy who triggered Joe Kennedy to sell all his stocks before the Great Crash. It prevented me from increasing my equity holding.
4799 2018-02-05 17:48:37 #stocks MZOR and NFLX good show at 8 dema BUT the morning Bull reversals for SPY and QQQ stymied. Compass still pointed south...

4803 2018-02-05 17:46:18 Did you make money in 87, 96, 00, 01, 02, 08?   Very tough to do. 1.000’s companies failed. In stocks. Crypto is diff. It’s all supple/demand. Which is super hard to calculate.  So now what?  Right? Suoer hard to determine. Protect in bear and make money pull.  Simple stuff

4805 2018-02-05 17:45:33 Interesting how stocks and crypto are getting hammered at the same time.
4806 2018-02-05 17:45:12 Stocks Are in The Tank. Duh. 
4807 2018-02-05 17:44:38 Stocks = US economy now.  Every drop in US stocks = drop in US tax receipts = rise in UST issuance = rise in UST yields = drop in US econ/stocks = drop in US tax receipts = rise in UST issuance = rise in UST yields... biggest question IMO = when does Fed cry "uncle"?

4809 2018-02-05 17:44:14 No, its not true (and I've proved it, here). Unemployement is down, Stocks are up, and the GOP plan lowers everyone's initial Tax Burden (Pretty much).  Argue what you want on the GOP, they do TONS wrong... but not those 3 points. Yes, the rich benefit, so? Oceans are salty, too
4810 2018-02-05 17:44:12 Markets ignore this political noise or factor it in. Just taking profits in a well-anticipated  temporary pullback. Also, higher bond rates tend to have people moving some long-term money out of stocks into bonds for the increasing yield & Security.
4811 2018-02-05 17:43:15 No, I was quoting a CNBC guy talking about stocks
4812 2018-02-05 17:43:13 Are there aNy healthcare ETF stocks?
4813 2018-02-05 17:43:12 This year I've been investing in stocks with Robinhood app anyone try it
4814 2018-02-05 17:42:51 In an under-levered economy with good demographics & lots of room to cut rates, a fall in US stocks would be enough to cause big problems.  In an over levered, highly-financialized economy with aging demographics & no room to cut, a fall in stocks = "Katy, bar the door"
4815 2018-02-05 17:42:02 #Stocks,#Indexes Unless something really changes, the signals (SPX and NDX) coming later today are not bottom but TOP SIGNALs. Updates forthcoming.

4817 2018-02-05 17:41:31 Then consider the effective collateral for hundreds of billions of (debt-fueled) corporate share repurchases - again, US stocks.
4818 2018-02-05 17:41:19 This is a point that I’ve seen few make. You can’t buy stocks with credit cards. We shouldn’t have ever been able to buy crypto with credit cards.
4819 2018-02-05 17:41:11 I’m planning on watching it tonight.
4820 2018-02-05 17:40:55 Then consider that net capital gains + taxable IRA distribs in latest IRA data was ~200% of annual PCE Growth, & that PCE is ~2/3 of US GDP.  If PCE growth falls, US GDP will likely fall.  If stocks fall, PCE growth will likely fall.

4833 2018-02-05 17:37:27 The bounce fades in stocks: S&P 500 falls to the lows The bounce evaporates
The S&P 500 is down 26 points and near the worst levels of the day. The index had climbed back into positive territory after a similar fall at the open.

4843 2018-02-05 17:32:17 We believe that the run up in the markets was very closely related to the run up in cryptos and that euphoria is waning and might be a bubble blowing..Money from cryptos was being used to by stocks..
4844 2018-02-05 17:32:05 This sea of red is a perfect buying opportunity. Technicals could be very useful in finding the bottom of these promising stocks and then loading up ahead of time. Eventually this downturn will even out as we get used to a better economy & higher interest rates.

4903 2018-02-05 17:09:44 There are probably stocks (via mutual funds or ETFs) in your 401K, especially if it is employer-directed. Maybe even excess employer stock. This means excess risk for most people.

4905 2018-02-05 17:09:31 "First level thinking" permeates the business media airways. 
Not value added or very insightful.
As Howard Marks writes first level is stocks are rising because earnings are strong.
Second level is have markets discounted the strong EPS?

4961 2018-02-05 16:52:56 Make an investment plan and stick with it. That is true for stocks as much as it's true for #cryptocurrency ...or as I like to call crypto, Venture Capital with liquidity... hld on, nibble at the cryptos on yor buy list...and stick to your plan even if we go down a little further

4964 2018-02-05 16:52:24 This is not a great example because quite a few will lie & nowhere near all 401ks are invested in stocks either as for average workers they aren't necessarily the best investment...just more proof the stock market says little about the well being of average working Americans.
4965 2018-02-05 16:51:41 If the EURO closes below $1.24 it might be game over for commodities as well, forget stocks here they're already gone

5274 2018-02-05 15:31:05 @CNBC just had on Savita Subramanian @BofAML head of US equity who mentioned 2 key market points not raised by anyone else yet-that only half their ‘sell/danger’ indicators were flashing & any inflation can be sector contained. Astute analysis.Have her on again #stocks #inflation
5275 2018-02-05 15:30:51 You know what? That’s fair. I’ll delete the last couple. 

That said, I do think there’s a strong case that Trump has inflated a bubble that will hurt people when it pops and that he should be held accountable for that. Which is a bit different from just “Stocks down Trump bad.”

5298 2018-02-05 15:27:47 I'm sure others have said this but their reasoning is bogus.
all stocks and shares go up and down, some dramatically, yet they're singling this thing out?

5319 2018-02-05 15:24:24 What the institutions are doing to critical metals stocks right now, including #lithium & #cobalt, should be criminal.

5325 2018-02-05 15:22:56 I love how people are using a day and a morning of the market dropping as proof of a tanking economy. They obviously have no idea how the market works:

Buying stocks brings it up,
Selling brings it down.

People bought low and sold when it was record high. Called smart investing
5326 2018-02-05 15:22:48 Honestly, how many black people are actively investing?

I’m sure it’s more about exposure than location but the only talk of investing I heard growing up was stocks & those black ppl said & I quote, “that’s a white man thang.”

5331 2018-02-05 15:22:24 Yes it is good, but not for the reason you state. A fund manager manages the funds held in a Trust, which owns the stocks. The funds in the trust are completely separate from the managers balance sheet. Except maybe if you’re the PIC.

5401 2018-02-05 15:06:04 For one this confuses stocks with flows. GDP is measure of expenditure in a year, so is a flow, while a share is a stock. So the analogy doesn't make any sense.
5402 2018-02-05 15:06:00 I'm a little puzzled by the, "Stocks fall on news of rising wages means our economy is broken," takes, I gotta say.

It only makes sense when you conflate stock market performance with the health of the economy.

5428 2018-02-05 15:01:39 A 10% return on cash (FCF) corresponds nicely with the 10% that one expects as a minimum reward for owning stocks long term.

And if you found a $20 stock with a sustainable $10 per share FCF, mortgage your house and buy all the shares you can find.

5429 2018-02-05 15:01:38 On Friday, the #DJIA was weaponized. Because Trump treats the stock market as a barometer of the economy, the temptation will be great for geopolitically-minded capital pools to lock in their gains now #stocks #geopolitics

5669 2018-02-05 13:58:55 The reason why stocks plummeted on Friday is because Libtards still exist in America !! 
5670 2018-02-05 13:58:47 Another weak opening for the market in general so I assume MJ stocks will follow suit

5682 2018-02-05 13:55:31 US stocks still the real concern but US yields are backing off the highs.. 2.835% last..
5683 2018-02-05 13:55:31 Why are stocks down? Maybe it's because CEOs who were grateful for #Trump's #TaxCuts gave their employee bonuses; but investors rebelled because they didn't get larger dividends , and are now getting even by selling off their stocks.
5684 2018-02-05 13:55:24 US stocks still the real concern but US yields are backing off the highs.. 2.835% last

5700 2018-02-05 13:51:55 Yes.  But it won’t do anything until pkt stocks stop the sell off
5701 2018-02-05 13:50:16 First, you mentioned buying stocks when others are selling (markets falling, similar to what we've been experiencing). Currently, I have ETFs. Though they are declining in value, I should still out my money in them too prepare for the rebound, correct?
5702 2018-02-05 13:50:06 Finding a Tesco that stocks Milo AND vegemite has made my day. 
5703 2018-02-05 13:49:45 We dont see the opposite happening in any market. Simple ests rising or falling on an absolute basis is not enough. It’s merely a first level observation...ie if $SPY EPS ests start rising at a lesser rate, stocks should fall

5790 2018-02-05 13:19:04 The weakness in global equity markets along with the Union Budget re-introducing the  long term capital gains tax on equity investments led to a bigger  correction in the banking and housing finance stocks.

5793 2018-02-05 13:17:33 So this is why the mega rich are dumping oil & gas stocks like a hot potato. Wow!
5794 2018-02-05 13:17:20 interesting to hear the changes on Bloomberg TV from 1 week ago where the same daily/weekly guests/commentators all said stocks to the moon on fundamentals. In the fall they said rates wouldn't be a factor for 18+ months. Look how much has changed in a few days time.
5795 2018-02-05 13:16:27 #Stocks,#Indexes  Exact timing not yet predictable, but this is: we will  see a stunning rally this week that will make observers, especially the  naive and those who live by writing melodrama, believe the selloff was a  fluke.
5796 2018-02-05 13:15:48 Gonna be a good day to buy some stocks. #BTFD
5797 2018-02-05 13:15:17 unlike some a$$-oles, I am not going to say omg so happy stocks falling. Should never feel joy out of people's loss

5799 2018-02-05 13:15:03 @realDonaldTrump Stocks and Futures DOWN!!!! Tweet about that! 
Stocks? 
Futures?

You know what that means? Or maybe you don't since your own attempt at being a publicly traded stock FAILED.

5833 2018-02-05 12:57:42 I ask myself this: Do I believe stocks are worth 30 times earnings while personal, govt, corporate debt is at all time highs and productivity is extremely low. Add currency/ trade wars, divisive casino President, and CB treasury selling.  Yes, I have never been more bearish.
5834 2018-02-05 12:57:31 Just ask your self if a repeat of 2008 were to happen which are the stocks u would like to hold on to.. that will clear up a lot of clutter, my personal view is the bull market is on and this is a correction, within 6 months up-move could resume.

5838 2018-02-05 12:54:33 Correct. Borrowers who were still credit-worthy after the financial crisis (wealthy individuals and firms) took advantage of cheap money and invested in assets like stocks and real estate, hence the stock market boom. Regular households were not bailed out, hence low CPI.
5839 2018-02-05 12:53:33 If the market activity of the last week caused you to question your process, perhaps it’s appropriate to revisit your long-term target asset mix. (Jargon Free: if you logged into your account obsessively or if you made some changes, you got too many stocks)
5840 2018-02-05 12:53:07 Perhaps disingenuous to make that claim when stocks have continued to rise in 4Q17, and in January, absent further spread tightening
5841 2018-02-05 12:53:05 I have to say this has truly been a very humbling year for me as a football fan. One of the laughing stocks of the NFL, QB uncertainty, watching an arch rival win it all. I think this was a humbling year for all Giant fans.

5843 2018-02-05 12:51:52 only point I would take issue with is idea that a handful of managers have significant influence over stock market...no doubt larger managers can at times drive individual stocks. But to attribute the bulk of rise/fall over time to large managers is silly.

5847 2018-02-05 12:50:24 I held on to the pot stocks because waiting for the legalization, it's my feeling it's yield at least a 100% return on most stocks. It'll level off after it's legalized but until then I'm holding.

Really?
It’s not like inflation is at 5% or some super crazy number, 10%, whatever!
It’s barely 2%.
And if I’m not mistaken (I could be wrong on this), the FEDs main inflation tool PCE, is below 2% still.

5950 2018-02-05 11:46:13 Well I use code just to identify stocks which meet certain Technical criteria, then do a final chart check manually, but placement of orders is manual. How about you?

5957 2018-02-05 11:41:33 #jimcramer Do you agree there are many stocks already at a 10-15% pullback? People are so ritualistic that they believe the market as a whole must pull back 5-10% before getting a good deal.  Stock prices should actually have a set multiple based off factors.

5959 2018-02-05 11:40:00 Stock market is a minefield. People who have invested in stocks know the risks involved. Mr Adhia does not understand the risks of investing in stock market and he is our Finance Secretary. How do we manage to put such people in important seats is what beats me.
5960 2018-02-05 11:37:29 It's ok though you can still spend as much as you like in Casinos, Online gambling sites and of course stocks that equally may pop. This is also a bank that was bailed out by the British taxpayer in 2008 to the tune of 20bn due to a failing business model

6021 2018-02-05 10:43:25 I agree from the angle of they're not blocking gambiling and stocks. However I can agree with the limitation there. If it was on debit cards I could see a bigger argument. They just don't want you to gamble their money on something clearly going down.

6071 2018-02-05 10:12:11 Look, every market goes bullish, builds up a bubble, bubble bursts and then the crash happens. The cycle then repeats itself. This happens in stocks, housing etc not just crypto. Which is why if you want to call a crash, you also need to call the timing.

6074 2018-02-05 10:10:29 Sounds really good except they're all buying back stocks and pocketing the savings. Companies are firing, not hiring. It's just as detractors predicted. Making rich richer on backs of middle class is not making it honestly.

6100 2018-02-05 09:55:24 Less volatile wouldn't necessary mean better upside
On the contrary isn't it better buying stocks which have fallen more without the underlying business changing but only cz of panic . 
Makes the upside greater when sanity comes back to the market. Isn't it?

6423 2018-02-05 06:04:32 LTCG- One school of thought says, the lines between short-term and long-term investing will be blurred. Investors won't have to gain much by holding stocks for more than a year now as before. Short-term holding  attracts 15% tax, and long term holding stocks attract 10%.???

6430 2018-02-05 06:00:43 What does any of that mean? Well for one the Saudi King knew our market was going to crash which means he gets insider information. Second the saudis own lots of stocks in american companies which is frightening.

6447 2018-02-05 05:44:41 Australian stocks tumbled on Monday, taking their cue from a slump on Wall Street where data showing strong wages growth fuelled fears over inflation and the possibility of the Federal Reserve moving more quickly to raise interest rates

6457 2018-02-05 05:34:43 News sources are very personal, everybody has their own sources. I get my news through the people I follow on Twitter. If the milkman comes to my door telling me to sell my stocks and bonds, wouldn't make sense for me to do so
6458 2018-02-05 05:34:37 All the positive things with the economy was started by Obama . And BTW stocks are now plummeting

6467 2018-02-05 05:30:10 Twitter has been trying to get there stocks up, They make their money by advertising, so they are vulnerable, if a bunch of us let the sponsors know. This PC crap has gone too far, and it's one sided.

6475 2018-02-05 05:24:43 When stocks are climbing, we talk prices. When they fall, we talk timeframes. Maybe we should do the opposite.
6476 2018-02-05 05:23:44 It is impossible to time markets. If it happens, it is by fluke.
But, we can price the market!
What else we want, when #correction is providing a particular stock below your acceptable #price.
Hardly any #fundamental change in few good #stocks
Correction providing an opportunity.

6479 2018-02-05 05:22:24 I really should invest in tear gas stocks.
6480 2018-02-05 05:22:18 Thank you. One more question though, how much do suggest one starts with in trading stocks as it has low leverage? Cause coming from Forex ( still learning though) one can start with 2k, 3k as it is highly leveraged.
6481 2018-02-05 05:21:10 They don’t hire anymore people,it’s what GOP call trickle down economics.Only it never trickles down. They buy more stocks n bond to increase their worth, not ours.They give to GOP CANDIDATES SO THEY CAN KEEP GETTING MORE TAX CUTS.

6511 2018-02-05 05:05:31 Well you probably don't want to go all in on one coin. But your crypto money is for crypto, not for USD or stocks. I don't believe in averaging down for reasons I could go on about, so keeping money in USD is basically not investing it into crypto. Might as well be in the bank.

6515 2018-02-05 05:02:07 I suggest not to compare crytpo market with stocks. The supply of bitcoin is well known and according to blockchain we know where the money is and when the pumps started. That count also for alts.

6518 2018-02-05 04:59:21 Massive but healthy correction. Shit stocks will vanish only companies with strong fundamentals will survive. #NiftyCorrection
6519 2018-02-05 04:58:41 My Experiential Observation shows me Momentum & Hope Stocks correct 50% or more during Market Correction and Quality Growing Stocks which have Earnings Visibility might correct 20 - 25%.

6531 2018-02-05 04:52:29 A question is the extent to which ICOs are seen as permanent hodlers. 

For stocks the price impact of getting added to an index is permanent because it is assume index holding will be the same or go up. What % of ICOs need to hold to function vs will sell to fund development?
6532 2018-02-05 04:52:22 All of the momentum stocks have lost momentum?

6554 2018-02-05 04:37:05 Even all the major stocks on BSE and Nifty  are on free fall @Atulsingh_Asan  so even if you purchase ETF these days it will also give negative returns so have patience and hold the stocks
6555 2018-02-05 04:35:59 Currency traders starting to buy the dip in the AUD and NZD. Wonder if that will act as a lead indicator for stocks in the hours ahead.
6556 2018-02-05 04:34:40 Warned about correction looming (the VIX rising WITH rising equity markets) after more than 400 days without a sell-off in global equity markets, in last Monday's podcast. It is now transpiring- healthy and needed. #markets #investing #bonds #equity #stocks #invest #Shares
6557 2018-02-05 04:34:40 I think 2-3 zone kind of inflate stocks for guys like him. I remember hearing about a study about that/syracuse. Syracuse stock numbers  supposedly  not being as translatable.
6558 2018-02-05 04:33:23 I had bought some stocks on 2nd February but its not showing under my holdings today. Can you explain why it is happening? @zerodhaonline
6559 2018-02-05 04:33:19 Martis, do you  mind if I ask you a question? I'm always keen to learn and you obviously have  great deal of experience, but if you'd rather not answer, no problem. You are obviously very nimble. How many stocks would you own at any one time?
6560 2018-02-05 04:33:18 My take is retail investors should not flee the market. Every large correction is an opportunity. Last one month mid caps small caps corrected by 30-40% in many cases. Choose your stocks and utilise the opportunity
6561 2018-02-05 04:33:14 Wow. Your stocks and customers will drop immediately. Congrats
6562 2018-02-05 04:32:31 Only nifty stocks what about mid and small caps
6563 2018-02-05 04:32:01 Mkt recovery with large caps to happen from second half and max by Wednesday. Mid & Small caps to recover by end of this week. Look for fundamentally, low PE beaten down stocks. Use the opportunity.
6564 2018-02-05 04:31:44 @gtripathy66 markets will bounce back within this week as heavy buying will happen at lows ...Pakistan factor worrying, though #stocks

6570 2018-02-05 04:25:38 How much?
6571 2018-02-05 04:25:35 Earlier last week i sold everything and held it in cash. Since then these stocks slid down another 20-30%. However, i see this is an opportunity now to get back in at a huge discount. The challenge now is picking the biggest potential gainers. Lets see how the week plays out
6572 2018-02-05 04:25:24 You made a political stand while the military was turned down.  Good luck with your stocks #tmobileisterrible
6573 2018-02-05 04:25:00 I just wanted to say SHALOM. ADAM SHALOM. How did you come up with your own Feuerstein rule on stocks you would think the SEC would frown on this
6574 2018-02-05 04:24:53 Not only an enemy of our children, as is his EPA, but someone whose ignorance will lead to China dominating renewable energy. If @realDonaldTrump were not so dumb, one would wonder about collusion with the Chinese or ownership of Chinese stocks.

Stock market benefits people who have stocks. 

Tax relief benefits people who have jobs 

Kissing Russia's ass benefits no Americans except the kushners and the trumps.
6577 2018-02-05 04:22:11 Savingsaccount is like holding onto to"cash".  Interest ratesregardless,sold hold off on long term bonds until later. Dividends always good for retirement income. Uncertainty ineconomy with craziness ingov;so other stocks are just..???..
6578 2018-02-05 04:21:55 The pros have done and are doing their jobs though. a lot of stocks sold down to support levels and pros have been buying. Now they'll sell it back to the mums and dads who buy them back on the bounce! Lol
6579 2018-02-05 04:21:49 Thinking this might be a good time to unload those bioceramic stocks from the  portfolio. #TB12 #SB52
6580 2018-02-05 04:21:47 Agreed. Popcorn stocks would go through the roof. If you run I'm investing. Please run. The hysteria if you won would be ALMOST as good as when Trump won.

6585 2018-02-05 04:18:55 There are some juicy levels on certain stocks out there! Time to go cherry picking! But with reasonable amounts! 
6586 2018-02-05 04:18:09 Rightly said @UdayanMukharjee !!!! @CNBC_Awaaz keep buying large cap quality stocks on crashes without xpecting profit in 2018...2019 & 2020 u wl hv all returns
6587 2018-02-05 04:17:46 The bloodbath. Lucky I bought illiquid stocks
6588 2018-02-05 04:17:42 So many stocks seeing deep correction on shallow volumes.
6589 2018-02-05 04:17:21 2 possible options(both of which I'm uncertain about).(1)Sell non-dividend stocks(keep those with dividends)& putinto good old Saving(1yr CD higher interest),just re-buy after correction(2)look for relatively cheap dividend yield stocks(keep dividend stock you have).
6590 2018-02-05 04:17:15 Metal stocks are the biggest losers. Sector index down by almost 3% on both exchanges.

6664 2018-02-05 03:42:15 Bump stocks aren’t made to kill people. They’re for novelty. There are bad people out there. Blame the people not the piece of metal they used. You can’t blame a machine for how people wield it. That’s insanity.
6665 2018-02-05 03:42:14 Is it the reason sage investors always advised that invest in quality secular stocks not in cyclicals?
6666 2018-02-05 03:42:03 Yes looking forward to seeing what the leading stocks are that emerge after this pull back is done.

6672 2018-02-05 03:37:43 Bump stocks are ridiculously hard to fire accurately. They’re only present a chance to hit anything when the target is very large and far away, like the crowd. I don’t believe they should be as easy to obtain as they are but people will always find a way to kill each other.

6689 2018-02-05 03:28:49 In CNX 500:

Almost 400 stocks are below 50 DMA
Almost 225 stocks are below 200 DMA

Almost 300 stocks are 5% below 50 DMA
Almost 150 stocks are 5% below 200 DMA

Nifty cmp: 10740
50 DMA : 10545
200 DMA : 10013

The weight of the market could pull Nifty near/below 50 DMA atleast.

6693 2018-02-05 03:26:19 Folks, that joy you're feeling for watching an arrogant athlete lose a game? Imagine if you could retain that feeling and direct it towards 1%ers getting thrown in the stocks and their houses turned into a smash-n-grab sale. It's achievable.
6694 2018-02-05 03:25:59 I feel like a total adult today! I deposited money to my bank account, bought stocks, and paid my credit card bill!
6695 2018-02-05 03:25:53 Good. Now let's hope it stays that way or goes down lower. It deserves about 5% of the hype it went through. Ripple is a business. XRP is a coin. People act like they are buying stocks. And when Ripple says ripple, they mean a private ledger most of the time.

6830 2018-02-05 02:04:56 Corn guys should be concerned about this.  Right now sorghum goes to China and Corn has backfilled the prev milo demand in Mexico and ethanol.  If China slows down, milo returns to Mexico and ethanol plants displacing Corn at a reduced price.  Not good for reducing stocks.

6898 2018-02-05 01:18:43 When the US "spends" $5.6 trillion on war (in 17 yrs) it sounds like the money went away. In reality it is a slick funneling system for "economic growth". Most of that money was "created" from bonds, given to corporations and hence goes to jobs/stocks/etc. PJ

6913 2018-02-05 01:09:35 Yes put em in the stocks. Definitely what should happen to them for making an honest decision in a game of football that still no one can agree on despite 200 replays.
6914 2018-02-05 01:09:17 Wait until you have to pay taxes next year. Don’t get too excited yet. If you have stocks, own a home or property in most states that write off is crap or gone . And the individual write off is shit and so is family. So wait for it...

6926 2018-02-05 00:54:17 Yup, as long as bond yields keep rising and pressuring stocks down, crypto will be in difficulty . Nikkei stock market open looks bad ATM. It will be hard to have Bitcoin rally on these conditions .

6934 2018-02-05 00:37:58 Oz is really gutless. The USA is way over-priced compared to the ASX but when it goes down 2.5%, Oz stocks drop even more...
6935 2018-02-05 00:37:49 Channels in other stocks, futures, and forex do the same thing. If you lay your channel, add a 100% line on top and bottom (as potential new channels & S/R) they will jump in and out regularly. Crypto is still just in it's infancy and we're seeing these for the first time here.
6936 2018-02-05 00:36:58 No but at some point stocks have sold enough in the short term to digest where yields have recently moved.
