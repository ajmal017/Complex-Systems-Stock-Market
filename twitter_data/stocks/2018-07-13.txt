Great work Elon.

47 2018-07-15 23:24:03 Actually, you can use a mock investing platform if you have the discipline to follow through when no real money is at stake. You get a hypothetical $1M or $100K and "invest" in individual stocks, and at the end of some defined period look at your performance over time.

68 2018-07-15 23:01:47 As an individual, don't pick and trade stocks. Your probability of losing money is nearly 100%—and that's before the brokerage fees. Most professional fund managers underperform the S&P 500.

Buy an index fund/ETF and hold it.

70 2018-07-15 22:58:38 @nrockstars don’t think about market direction. taken individual business; check its advantages and valuation. market going up and down is all secondary. i would get fully invested if i get 2-3 stocks in my range. doesn’t matter if it is crash of 2008. all would know in hindsight
71 2018-07-15 22:55:54 By the way Apple, and couple other companies,  brought back stocks....Remember, back in December 2017, when they asked corporations how many were going to give increases of wages to their workers, I thinks only 10 raised their hands, out of maybe 100!! Hmm...
72 2018-07-15 22:55:16 What a week ahead!

China to release a slew of economic data, the Trump-Putin summit gets underway, and markets assess if the recent rally in stocks can sustain itself.
73 2018-07-15 22:54:45 Hi, great job with getting the strategy right. Just wondering if you are shorting low or high float stocks? I am currently experimenting trading high float stocks to the long side that has gapped up due to news. They seem to move 50%-100%. Downside is spread which can be choppy.
74 2018-07-15 22:54:13 I think we both know bank stocks will be fine. A lot of oil hedge money plus higher interest rates and buybacks.
75 2018-07-15 22:53:00 Geez! I've been eating out for the past 2 weeks! Finally decided to cook tonight. I should buy stocks in a Chinese restaurant - I would make myself some money!!
76 2018-07-15 22:52:16 People look for companies like HSBC, BT, MKS when hunting for dividend stocks.  However, these are mature businesses with issues.  Better to go for a lower yield stock like Unilever that doesn't have issues and can grow its payout.  This works out better over the long-term IMO.

80 2018-07-15 22:50:27 Question:  The Hill reported Novartis paid Cohen $1.2M & handed over list of drug policies including drug pricing proposal that became basis of Trump drug plan & subsequently resulted in pharma stocks up & higher drug prices.

100 2018-07-15 22:23:00 "Los ricos hacen su fortuna a costa de los pobres". La idea es que no importa la capacidad de cada persona en contribuir a generar riqueza. Se piensa en stocks y situaciones estáticas (suma a cero) en lugar de flujos y la dinámica de sistemas.
101 2018-07-15 22:21:17 Smart traders put their gains into passive income assets (real estate, businesses, bonds, stocks w/dividend). I would venture to guess if you have to say this to a trader, they may not be the crème of the crop. My trading mentors might agree!

106 2018-07-15 22:18:04 Yes. I've found that on any given day, some stocks will go up. some will go down, and some will break even.
107 2018-07-15 22:16:09 It’s because of what price means. Ordinally, stocks and what not go up because good things are happening. When xrp went to $3, people were speculating xrp was getting adopted by banks. At $.44, people are saying guess it didn’t get adopted. Price says something about fa success

110 2018-07-15 22:14:49 Stop with that economist crap. Anyone knows that we invest in stocks based on potential. We all moved money into stock based on Trump plan being good for business. I agree the market will adjust at some point, it must. But, the surge was due to Trimp...period.

132 2018-07-15 21:38:57 43?  What does that mean to us?  This is the actual number of U3O8 stocks associated with our sector.  That is not alot.  So, when TRIBECA says they will invest w $100 mil in 17 of them within 2 weeks what do we think?  They are talking to URA and this is why UEC has not been..

235 2018-07-15 19:31:07 Pretty much every full time employer offers a 401K - usually that's a stock market investment, so most all working people have a vested interest in the stocks. Most public companies offer stock options to their employees too.

257 2018-07-15 19:07:01 Why?... Why should they lose stock options 4 forming a union? How is it in their best interest when they can lose their jobs, along w/stock options, (not 2 mention that stocks fluctuate & when they go down ppl lose jobs) at any point, 4 any reason, w/no protection?
258 2018-07-15 19:06:32 Is this a buy signal for these stocks?
259 2018-07-15 19:02:08 Was it when he loaned about 10 trillion to keep the stocks floating?
Was it when he never reprimanded those that started the crisis?
Was it one of the 5 wars he started, one being a genocide?
Was it his disregard for national sovereignties?
260 2018-07-15 19:02:00 That's arrogance borne out of a 346 vote, Hastings majority that in 2022 will vanish faster than the EU plundered, south-coast fish stocks.

262 2018-07-15 18:59:15 Did you not see the recoil at 1:18 in the video? By the looks of it, this weapon pretty much requires you to be prone to use effectively. Especially if there's no grips/stocks etc as the video states.

Dunno about you, but I feel like that's a pretty big difference to the Mini
263 2018-07-15 18:58:49 All they are asking for:
1.) 21 to buy a gun.
2.) Full Background Checks
3.) 3 Day Waiting Period
4.) No Assault rifles
5.) No Bump stocks or High Capacity Magazines
6.) Red Flag laws so the police can confiscate weapons from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.

267 2018-07-15 18:48:10 QE already caused asset inflation everywhere. Stocks, bonds, property, even bitcoin 

Wait till commodities start rallying. The money will flow around eventually. That’s the breaking point for the consumer inflation on everyday goods.

296 2018-07-15 18:19:00 I believe our forefathers also didn’t include bump stocks, semiautomatics, and AR’s.

310 2018-07-15 17:56:48 Foi falso alarme, estavam pessoas a sair sem nada e assumimos o pior; mas estavam a ficar sem stocks então limitaram as compras 
311 2018-07-15 17:54:58 I am happy for him. Barça is not a selling club. So buying player is not like buying stocks.
312 2018-07-15 17:54:32 But emerging markets aren’t in correlation with US stocks, no? So if the S&P 500 is up 20% in a year, or NASDAQ is up big....what does that have to with businesses in Latin America or Asia?
313 2018-07-15 17:52:29 If it keeps us out of war, boosts our economy (trade war is making stocks rise), bringing back jobs to the US, and lowering taxes, why do you care so much? Because you just don’t like the guy? Shit, I don’t either but right now, we’re in a good spot... the world hate him but W/E

317 2018-07-15 17:48:27 The only people that benefited from the tax CUTS are the wealthiest 1%. When is the "trickle down" going to happen? Most Americans have no savings, no stocks and live pretty much paycheck to paycheck. Who exactly is better off?
318 2018-07-15 17:48:26 Yes, concur.  I have had stocks called away on shorts that collapsed within days, margin calls NOT met (close the position) and then the "broken clock club" membership got renewed (damnit... again....)  #SongRemainsTheSame #StillStanding
319 2018-07-15 17:46:43 Evil evil witches! I hope the lowlife get identified . Good excuse to bring back the stocks and have them paraded in the middle of the town. All hits to the head, so dangerous. If that was my daughter, well... let's hope the victim gets support.
320 2018-07-15 17:45:30 I’ve already seen that in only 3 days and totally agree. The major difference is this room is actually trying to teach people to trade, not make from their follow in to stocks

325 2018-07-15 17:39:19 Different clients have different allocations, but if the S&P 500 is up 20% for example, portfolios will gain more in the 12%-16% range. There are many asset classes that have different return streams. US stocks might return 20%, but maybe emerging markets gain 40% and bonds 4%.
326 2018-07-15 17:38:43 Con gusto Clau! Bueno personalmente usas stocks de buena manera sin embargo sería conveniente que adaptase bien algunas cosillas mejor en los Banners, sea con tema de iluminación y sombras. Luego como diseñadora usted me parece que si va por buen camino! 
327 2018-07-15 17:38:09 Jim Murren the CEO of MGM who owns Mandalay Bay Hotel supports pro-Islamic organizations. The shooter’s possible ties to Islam could further explain the use of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Murren dumped a massive amount of his MGM stocks in the weeks leading up to the attack.
328 2018-07-15 17:35:15 This comparison is meaningless. Market cap is a valuation (a value). GDP is an amount produced. You are confusing stocks with flows. If you want to do this comparison--but why??--you need to compare countries GDPs with companies' REVENUES, not their market caps.
329 2018-07-15 17:34:53 Corporations are using their huge tax break to buy back their stocks making more money for shareholders. Employees are still getting nothing.
330 2018-07-15 17:33:26 “The Working” people are working! 3.8% unemployment, higher wages, record minority unemp, stocks r up, jobs r up, I’m confused by SenWarren’s statement. Dems r not for the “working” people. They are for power to rule the “working” people!

333 2018-07-15 17:32:25 I'm extremely bullish crypto stocks for the near future. I'm going to start trading these very aggressively from the long side soon. Dabbling for now.
334 2018-07-15 17:30:08 If everything is correlated with bitcoin and most things whether stocks, crypto, commodities, react to the rumor of the news rather than the actual news itself,  market pump cycles should easily become decipherable and evident 
335 2018-07-15 17:28:47 Or, as mentioned, open the white gate by bishops to allow easier access. OR try and complete work at the end of stocks lane joining Sandy Lane to open that route up sooner. OR offer and suggest alternative back-lane routes to those that don’t know around to christleton area
336 2018-07-15 17:28:07 And didn't you sell our GM stocks at a loss just to pad the balance sheet so it looked like you had a surplus??????? Stop your lying. It is unbecoming of the LOO and also disrespectful to voters. #bebetter

346 2018-07-15 17:20:10 @Iceguru38 any proof? Or do you think all volatile penny stocks are scams?
347 2018-07-15 17:20:03 Futures are diff animal than stocks.  The latter has to be borrowed and is more scarce.  Also, you’re talking about a currency, basically.  For a shortsqueeze in gold, you need $ to sell off big,or bond yields to sell off massively.  FX & rates are less volatile than stocks.
348 2018-07-15 17:19:45 I invest my money in stocks so my money flip in my sleep.....y’all can keep that fast money shii
349 2018-07-15 17:19:41 Didn't all the money printing start under Bush Junior? Anyway, I agree that the cycles of huge economies are probably much longer/slower than we think. People have been telling me since 2011 that stocks are about to crash :-)

355 2018-07-15 17:17:11 US stocks would likely fall, but other assets we hold may not, so the net result would be pretty mild in most cases. We would then rebalance back to target allocations and be ready for the next cycle.

382 2018-07-15 16:56:29 BalakrishnanR I remember Michael Batnick mentioning more than two third of the stocks underperform indices and only 25% or one fourth is responsible for wealth creation. Morgan Housel has also shared some insights on this subject. Need to dig further.

419 2018-07-15 16:17:02 We absolutely do not have nationwide common sense gun laws.  We need better universal background checks, longer waiting periods, mandatory training classes, age restrictions, closing loopholes at gun shows, banning AR-15s and assault rifles/bump stocks and many more things.

437 2018-07-15 15:55:15 Socialism doesn’t allow individual ownership of property, companies, stocks, etc.  the ONLY reason those social programs (NOT SOCIALIST)BARELY SURVIVE is because they are supported completely by tax revenue collected from people and companies working in a CAPITALIST market.

522 2018-07-15 14:41:37 If T May can miraculously get her soft and squidgy Brino Brexit through it will pretty much mean Status Quo with smaller Payments to EU. Hence very little impact to UK Economy and this could mean UK Stocks are undervalued as pricing in far worse outcomes.
523 2018-07-15 14:40:11 All I needed was the headline/title of this breaking news....
"Stocks Are Inexpensive And There Is No Evidence This Bull Market Is About To End Soon"
524 2018-07-15 14:38:23 A gold disc is money in fact the only thing we have of value in this country is stock and property. Stocks backed by materials, and by industry. You then transfer that wealth to a gold backed currency and you’ve stolen from the US citizens.
525 2018-07-15 14:38:04 Tax cuts for corporations are not tax cuts for the people. I have not seen a change in my check!!! Stocks are great so his rich friends are doing well. Tariffs are hurting American companies. Gas is up... I would go on but this is a fake account. Just want others to see!!
526 2018-07-15 14:37:09 what kind of AR-15 is a .357? Or do you agree we don't need assault weapons with bump stocks and 120 round magazines to defend our homes?
527 2018-07-15 14:37:02 I find it interesting , the US has been in a trade deficit for at least 20 years or more! Losing billions! Why are we freaked out when Trump is trying even it out! To me it’s a win win sitatuation! Everyone else is acting silly and selling their stocks like crazy !
Buy buy buy !
528 2018-07-15 14:35:40 Best advice: never sell your stocks. Hold and hold

530 2018-07-15 14:34:37 Canadian natural gas stocks major focus for me moving into rest of the summer.  Would like to see these gold stocks get off their ass also. I expect resolution either way soon.  Uranium setting up for a nice fall as well.
531 2018-07-15 14:34:07 Only place for bullies is in a field in stocks!  They forfeit human rights when they become inhumane
532 2018-07-15 14:34:02 It's easy not to be afraid of these levels and price action when: 

"Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
533 2018-07-15 14:33:28 Wow...@MeetThePress and @Elise_Jordan-please share your crystal ball with the rest of us so we can get a look at tomorrow's Dow close/stocks and lottery numbers.  While your at it-what was your ball saying election night, 2016? Did you also say "I just don't see how Trump wins"?
534 2018-07-15 14:31:32 I get a bit frustrated with the labelling of any Stock with a big Dividend as an 'Income Stock'. To me such Stocks should have Defensive and Enduring features and often the stuff called Income Stock is just a struggling Company. eg #MKS #BT.A are not Income Stocks to me.

537 2018-07-15 14:28:52 She's a corporatist matt, who takes great amounts of private money. She questioned Zuckerberg without disclosing her husband has stocks in his company... We don't need multimillionaire elites doing our political bidding...

542 2018-07-15 14:20:17 Intresting to see you read so many ARs. Are these your portfolio stocks or outside it also ? I avoid reading too much outside .
543 2018-07-15 14:20:02 We should yes but they are listed stocks! The Pipeline was bought so that they could slow done the process and control it federally, prevent its expansion longer! Obama killed CanAdian pipelines for years!
544 2018-07-15 14:19:47 Hmmmm? Cryptocurrency or stocks?
545 2018-07-15 14:18:31 They’ve made it so hard to get a physical copy. I’m not ordering from Amazon coz it could get damaged. There’s only one chain store in the UK that stocks it & my local one is in a mall 
546 2018-07-15 14:18:04 Britain’s Brexit dilemma: are Leavers losing faith?  If May's leave plan is all that good why do they consider the need to put this propaganda out? It's a plan that keeps us in the EU and we will have to keep paying them over 40 billion plus our fishing waters and fish stocks.
547 2018-07-15 14:17:02 everyone stocks up on the chocolate pb!!! and so happy the good word is spreading.

559 2018-07-15 14:03:16 It amazes me that under BO the DEMs lost the House, they lost the Senate, they lost over 1000 seats country wide, and eventually could not save their nomination for POTUS.  Yet, he is somehow their savior and advisor for elections?  Is he an example of what not to do?
560 2018-07-15 14:03:10 NO why sehun knows abt lightstick stocks
561 2018-07-15 14:03:02 Can you prove this was a lie as well? What is it they say about stocks? “Past performance is not ...”. Regardless, my comment obviously assumes this happened. I will retract if proved otherwise.
562 2018-07-15 14:02:53 Sir ye Sab to fundamental wale books hai... Last time also said the same thing. all I have read is about fundamental analysis. only book that has technicals is 'how to make money in stocks' that i bought after @anishpteli suggested when I asked him about CANSLIM.
563 2018-07-15 14:02:45 Hey @billingsgazette, I'm learning that Greg Gianforte just purchased private prison stocks that are making him rich off the recent immigrant detentions.

590 2018-07-15 13:37:41 50% decline in stocks: boomers don't feel confident about retiring, what a bummer.

50% decline in bonds: holy heck I'm curious what that world looks like. The 70s?
591 2018-07-15 13:36:54 lolllllll honestly if you think like that you dont deserve to touch scroll.. that is such a ignorant way of thinking..you really just said even if its a good project i wont touch it because people r shilling it on twitter ...you shouldnt touch any crypto then switch to stocks
592 2018-07-15 13:33:06 Actually gutted a few weeks after getting my vape the shop now stocks the pink ones 
593 2018-07-15 13:32:31 agreed -- shunning is appropriate.  run the video on SHAME ON YOU!, a program to run on public-access TV.  meant to serve as VR public stocks for all transgressors who merit the shaming.  like, e.g., the Cook County cop who ignored the woman wearing the Puerto Rican tee shirt.

595 2018-07-15 13:30:19 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
596 2018-07-15 13:26:54 Stocks has news in Canada at least. Apple News isn’t available here yet, so the two apps aren’t tightly linked in terms of availability.
597 2018-07-15 13:26:26 In the 2000 dotcom bubble , US traders lost more money in options than in stocks . Same thing is about to be repeated here
598 2018-07-15 13:25:34 Hi John, thank you for your interest.  We are currently restocking and hope to have stocks fully replenished by Autumn.  Hope that helps.
599 2018-07-15 13:22:19 @RepLaHood. The title sounds great, but I wonder how your stock portfolio would benefit from this act? I've learned that when lobbyists recruit congressmen to sponsor legislation there is usually something in it for the congressman. Own any healthcare stocks?

601 2018-07-15 13:20:05 Theoretically, the average *investor* can outperform (Nelson 2017), average *investment dollar* cannot (Sharpe 1991). Active equity funds are not stocks—different analysis. Quants underperforming terribly and short logic/reasoning. Advisor fees hurt over long run, definitionally.
602 2018-07-15 13:20:01 And I think fake paper stocks are more manipulated than crypto, if the FED printing money and buying stocks isn't manipulation I don't know what is, but thanks for agreeing I'm not doing anything personally wrong, ether way governments can't touch my money or print an devalue it
603 2018-07-15 13:19:59 Again, you have to give it time.  It's never immediate.  And FYI, if you own stocks, you technically aren't earning anything until you realize it, ie sell stock at a profit.   So why should they be taxed before they sell the stock?
604 2018-07-15 13:19:56 Corn numbers friendly, if you believe exports can increase 100 MB old/125 MB new.  Stocks cut much more than expected, but with no yield increase traders are concerned.  Maybe USDA reluctant to increase yield do to trouble areas in MN, SD, and IA.  Others see tip back due to heat

612 2018-07-15 13:05:44 Having said that I am terrible at stock picking and the question is better answered by a fundamentals guy. But dont fall for the line that Stocks outperform all other asset classes over time. Few do. Many dont.
613 2018-07-15 13:05:14 Greg, 3 years ago Amazon had the “high price tag” of $435. It’s now over $1800. Don’t be afraid of the expensive stocks.

632 2018-07-15 12:36:05 My guess is you hv bought better stocks
633 2018-07-15 12:35:47 it is up-to-date .. I seldom add new shares, mostly buying what I already have (I only want 10-12 stocks), hence the price sheet

652 2018-07-15 12:21:24 I know, right? Stocks are up, unemployment is down across the bored, the only democratic nation in the middle east finally has their capital, and Iran isn't being paid by us anymore. How terrible!
653 2018-07-15 12:21:23 consider this- EIGHT YEARS of "vote g0p to repeal & replace Ocare" and when they finally win EVERYTHING they show up with only their d*cks in their hands. NOTHING. they'd be pledging to flags with one eye glued to Iphones watching their stocks if russians occupied their offices.

693 2018-07-15 11:38:07 While I agree, the fact that 75% percent may not create wealth means that perhaps you have to focus even harder on finding the right individual stocks to build your portfolio. Yes, it’s all about portfolio returns but you need stocks from that 25% to make their impact.
694 2018-07-15 11:37:34 Solar panel farms, not on houses.  I focus on underpriced stocks
695 2018-07-15 11:36:15 Balanced funds’ straightforward mix of stocks and bonds can discourage investors from behaving in self-defeating ways, leading to strong returns.

Warren Buffett started buying stocks when he was 11 years old.
697 2018-07-15 11:35:57 Cliff, how can the preference of index components not distort index component prices over non index stocks?  Passive vs Active isn’t the thing.  It’s index stocks trading at a premium to non index.  This impacts capital formation I think?

702 2018-07-15 11:31:25 Michael? Yeah, I want you to talk to the drug companies. See what they want most.

But why, Boss? 

Michael, do you remember anything I’ve taught you? We fix policies. Novartis sells more. Stocks go up. 

And Novartis charges as much as they want? 

Yep. Everybody wins.

706 2018-07-15 11:29:37 Mike - I really like your system especially in the current market. How do you go about scanning for stocks that meet your criteria? Do you strictly use @MarketSmith? I was thinking about getting a trial and testing it out. Thanks for all your posts.
707 2018-07-15 11:26:23 @JohnChen please look back at all your statements and tell me should $10 be acceptable to shareholders? It is too low, check comparable stocks. So why not use 600 m out of 2400 m for self tender offer now on Monday. Open for 3 months.
708 2018-07-15 11:24:04 Nice caveat. Investors can't lose on a great stock. So all your losers are just shitty stocks. Do you decide this a priori?
709 2018-07-15 11:21:47 The basic ideas of
investing are to look
at stocks as business,
use the market's
fluctuations to your
advantage, and seek
a margin of safety.

717 2018-07-15 11:10:04 Bump stocks ban, universal background checks, AR 15 ban. No one needs an assault military rifle to hunt a deer. Sending their money to Congress to get their ways done. That’s what I don’t like about the NRA. 
718 2018-07-15 11:08:15 Trump promised a ban on bump stocks after Las Vegas and tougher background checks and better mental health screening after Stoneman Douglas. What did we get? Absolutely nothing.

728 2018-07-15 10:42:44 If the vast majority of all stocks are owned by non-insiders and if the majority of them are foreign funds who are already spooked, fixing the playing field to give an advantage to the minority is anathema and likely to have serious unintended consequences.

772 2018-07-15 09:35:25 Shareholder dividends are interest payments to the owners, the people who loan the corp. money to start/expand/operate. Anyone with stocks, mutual funds, pension plans, etc., to include unions and many municipalities, are shareholders.

777 2018-07-15 09:21:21 I am thinking long term, hence why I'm totally fine to wait and let it settle down into it's next consolidation range. It's just a risk mitigation strategy and one thing I know with stocks is there's no need to fomo, nothing goes up in a straight line forever.

779 2018-07-15 09:17:37 Fishing in the west this past few weeks i’ve heard a lot of chat from local people on how the fish stocks have been decimated by the big trawlers. I have seen it with my own eyes, not a mackerel to be had. #overfishing #wherearethefish #Galway #supertrawlers #savetheocean

795 2018-07-15 08:40:44 Stocks etc are financial subjects & quantifiable. Therefore avoidable. Twitter is general shoot & scoot.

798 2018-07-15 08:38:59 Looks like US will outperform with FAANG leading the charge how money will be sucked back into US.  I am looking for shorts away from US for now - having value stocks in US, delta neutral portfolio and strong theta cashflow.
799 2018-07-15 08:37:04 In the first place, employers haven't invested enough on capital stocks since the late 1990's. And many workers cannot get their works done in the working hour because work assignments are too much. Aren't these matters a matter of what employers must deal with first, are they?

808 2018-07-15 08:20:50 Also, best stock sound as well. I normally tend to slash the stocks for after markets such as #yoshi or #akrapovic , not this time.

818 2018-07-15 08:02:16 It is true the ISM is elevated, but it was at 72 when the bear market of 73-74 started, and it was at 60 when the market crashed in 1987. However, I understand that by not being bearish on US stocks means you are not bullish either.

822 2018-07-15 07:46:41 In 2017, a few stocks with zero or little growth prospects scaled up to 200-300%

In 2018, a few stocks with incredible growth rate hammered down by 40-50%
823 2018-07-15 07:45:41 Well I’m thinking about investing in some stocks since the one that will probably sell the most is ~$250 to make and is rumored to sell at ~$700 if memory serves.
824 2018-07-15 07:36:52 The slogans were only for preorder last May. We don’t have extra stocks right now.
825 2018-07-15 07:36:13 @myntra I am really fed up with u guys. Why do u run sales promotion, if u can not refill your stocks in reasonable time. What business logic is there in depleting stocks fast and not fulfilling for aeons.
826 2018-07-15 07:33:47 Also....nothing has turned into a hell hole since trump....everyday life is exactly the same....unemployment is down...stocks are up...nobody is losing any freedoms and the rivers are poisoned and the sky hasn't fallen...WTF koolaid are people drinking?

828 2018-07-15 07:28:43 It's also weird that this is pushed forward right when they get through a rough spot with stocks but managed to retain stability, and are doing well on meeting their numbers

833 2018-07-15 07:19:48 The only thing your followers need to ask themselves is, "how do I trade on such info" such charts are good for getting likes and retweets, useless when it comes to making money.

839 2018-07-15 07:13:37 Bro Ineos and bepl are kind of cyclical stocks .. ups and downs are common.. now they are seeing some correction due to higher crude
840 2018-07-15 07:10:57 I was wondering if the 16% cagr is misleading as the small cap index especially loses all the winner stocks from its index over time whereas the mid/large cap gain the winners (from small/mid) & drop the losers from their respective indices.

842 2018-07-15 07:09:48 When stocks get involved in bankruptcy proceedings their symbol gets a “Q” at the end. So saying “TSLAQ” is talking about signaling the future.. they haven’t filed yet so the symbol is not there
843 2018-07-15 07:08:55 Makes sense.
BTW Most websites give dividend yield ratio which is comparable across stocks
844 2018-07-15 07:03:34 Bro, unga list of stocks laam enaku puthusaa iruku. Nice selection bro.
Taking note fr ur messages.
Thanks fr sharing ur views bro.
845 2018-07-15 07:02:51 Yes, it is confusing retail investors and making them restless. They may think that only their stocks are not growing. And feel to shift but lose more in the process.

849 2018-07-15 07:00:50 RT TheBullBull "pantomath_group The exchanges must provide liquidity to SME stocks by lowering the minimum entry value. Things will fall in place."
850 2018-07-15 06:59:43 Lol. I think the term you're looking for is IPO

And regardless if they're that rich, they still invest on stuff. And to tell you more about IPO, that's basically selling your stocks to the market to gain more money. If they're that rich, why are they selling stocks to gain more?
851 2018-07-15 06:59:04 Its better to spend more on top-notch services rather than cut half the price and get close to shitty performances. Explains why our stocks have been falling. Investors are questioning the country’s credibility in administrating. #LRT3

856 2018-07-15 06:51:12 I don't buy stocks that are in a hype break out, it's asking for trouble when things settle down - learned that the hard way before. Other reason has been lack of spare funds and not ready to close positions elsewhere so basically no rush.

866 2018-07-15 06:39:43 And was the decoupling so large ?
867 2018-07-15 06:39:14 you still don't get the point :(  Check the portion you have marked. Did the smallcap/midcap index make new lows when the main Index was making new highs ?
868 2018-07-15 06:37:35 Sativa gang bang while I play with my stocks
869 2018-07-15 06:36:27 Ran out of blue - very limited stocks of each carried
870 2018-07-15 06:33:55 So now what will happen ? Nifty will come down or Small/midcap will go up ? That is the question.
871 2018-07-15 06:33:35 Do you need Burnol, enough stocks available for people like you
872 2018-07-15 06:32:53 You are missing the point. Show a place where one is close to ATH where another is breaking lows, and the difference is increasing at an accelerated rate
873 2018-07-15 06:31:55 What should be the approach by a common investor?  Direct Mutual funds or etf or  recommended stocks by advisory services

879 2018-07-15 06:23:17 and such go round speaking at Pakasa forums, telling half truths about their self made status. even if she was lying in bed the whole day, we would be told she has made so much in stocks ..a new title would be given to her.

881 2018-07-15 06:20:00 Truth is always bitter bro, this govt has nothing to show to people in last 4yrs except crying what congis didn't do in last 60yrs so the resort to their last sinister weapon "communal violence", but people are not fool they will show them in 2019 what they are upto,
882 2018-07-15 06:19:57 These days I kind of busy to study about stocks(I am dreaming making money a lot!). But also I am watching OW contenders KR sometimes. This is how I am living today. 
883 2018-07-15 06:19:15 IHUB bashers always use Caveat Emptor as a lame excuse to bash because Caveat Emptor is also designated to stocks that are suspected of fraudulent activity. In our case, it is a simple corporate action (reverse merger/name change). Nothing to worry about, in other words.

885 2018-07-15 06:17:16 In various states “bandaid” laws have been passed that sound okay on paper but don’t actually do anything. I think they also put regulations on bump-stocks.

888 2018-07-15 06:14:08 The people who WOULD take a haircut are those with a lot of money in stocks and bonds. Per Time in December of last year, 84% of domestically owned US stocks are held by the wealthiest 10%. Direct ownership of bonds has all but disappeared. In short, the donor class. 4/4

891 2018-07-15 06:10:07 Investing into stocks, bonds, and stuff in your own account is sort of like multi-tasking. 

If you're good at multi-tasking, you can trade crypto, just keep up with other areas of your life too.

901 2018-07-15 05:55:27 What I have done is focus on shorting stocks that are trending down & buying dips on the #FANG stocks. The uptrend on the FANG's will end soon but it's made my trading simple. When it comes to the $SPX, I buy $TVIX when the index is at resistance. I'll be buying $TVIX next week

904 2018-07-15 05:51:16 People talk about the stocks bought long time back multiplied many times.
1. First the quantity is very meagre.
2. Many stocks are not traded now, nobody will highlight this.
3. When everything is moving constantly how can ur portfolio be static, expecting to give good return

914 2018-07-15 05:36:30 Why would white wealth be held primarily in stocks?
915 2018-07-15 05:32:53 Sir, even you are predicting about stocks everyday on CNBC TV18 channel. Predictions are not random, you do your analysis and then you are predicting. So all credible predictors may have done their analysis.
916 2018-07-15 05:32:26 @PiyushGoyal Sir, barring few stocks in sensex entire market is bleeding and is almost like 2013, please review LTCG, ASM etc. Instead of LTCG think of higher STT.
917 2018-07-15 05:30:18 Social Wealth Funds are a Rube Goldberg machine. The government doesn't need to buy assets when it can just take the money directly. 

An effective 20% corporate tax has the same revenue effect as owning 20% of stocks in every company.

921 2018-07-15 05:27:41 If the NRA hadn't blocked banning bump stocks, if they had a better plan than, "let's arm the teachers," if they weren't trying to make silencers easier to buy, or guns to buy without a permit or training, maybe I'd think better of them.
922 2018-07-15 05:25:15 Just spoke with a Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor at an event for almost an hour. Was told about the importance of “diversification” and “we’ll never see a correction of 25% in my lifetime.” I have now decided to sell all stocks and go all in on crypto. Moon baby, moon!

933 2018-07-15 05:11:37 He’s not advocating for banning guns. He’s advocating for reasonable restrictions to gun access and its potential for harm (i.e., banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines, stronger background checks, and 3-waiting period) ... why wouldn’t you be for these measures?

945 2018-07-15 04:48:55 Personally, I see bump stocks as a novelty, which is actually all the more reason for them to be legal. Full auto is inaccurate as fuck and jerry-rigging full auto is a great way to expand a bunch of ammo w/o hitting shit.
946 2018-07-15 04:48:09 TCS results were OK not great. One time other income only boosted the net profit against street estimates. Infy results are not impressive and ADRs have tanked by 5%. Cyient results are bad.  Seems IT stocks are good candidates for shorting this result season

949 2018-07-15 04:41:17 How the f does if work??? Like what’s the difference in stocks and stuff. It’s so confusing.
950 2018-07-15 04:39:43 No emergency savings, and it would mean pulling money out of stocks, a few of which have a return rate than the interest rate on the loans. If dumbass Trump triggers a recession that might end anyway.
951 2018-07-15 04:39:26 In other words, “Thoughts and Prayers” if y’all really care, eliminate his complete earnings, stocks etc. Take your open letter and close it. #BS
952 2018-07-15 04:37:53 Did I say that? Get off your soap box. I own a gun.

However, I don't believe civilians need military style weapons w bump stocks. There only needed for mass murder.
953 2018-07-15 04:35:03 Just got approved for a new credit card, worked a double, submitted several apartment applications, email inbox flowing with marketing internship opportunities, all my stocks closed at an all time high today.....that’s all folks!!!
954 2018-07-15 04:33:13 "How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case." - Robert G. Allen  #stocks
955 2018-07-15 04:32:53 De acuerdo q GDP y market cap son poco comparables. La relación entre ambos es significativa de otras cosas, como sobre valoración de stocks
956 2018-07-15 04:29:56 Hey girl! Yes hope everything is good with you as well! Hell of a call! I’m still plugging away at stocks how you been?
957 2018-07-15 04:29:52 Final points:
This isn’t abt DFA, or Vanguard, it’s abt portfolio policy. It’s generally accepted in academic literature that the CAPM model, which holds stocks/bonds to be the predominant return factor, to be defunct.  Fama said “it’s an elegant theory, but it’s false.”

959 2018-07-15 04:25:10 Hope the composition of Wisdom tree fund is not the same 6 stocks that are driving Nifty up. idomestic flows  are causing this lopsided  nifty spike at expense of small/mid caps. Maybe FII are selling more of other EM’s but to call this a outperformance is a slight stretch.
960 2018-07-15 04:23:53 Everything a marketing ploy, wouldn’t be surprised once this die down all of a sudden Papa Johns sales/stocks rise
961 2018-07-15 04:23:39 The exchanges must provide liquidity to SME stocks by lowering the minimum entry value. Things will fall in place.
962 2018-07-15 04:21:36 I own some high quality undervalued stocks as well. Risk off on too many emerging companies.
963 2018-07-15 04:20:26 Investing in art seems more difficult than stocks.
964 2018-07-15 04:19:35 He already has the stocks (keep).  That would indicate the cost should have been accounted for somewhere.....?
965 2018-07-15 04:19:22 VCs and ICO investors that cast a wide net without doing enough research have a higher chance of losing money imo - than quality large cap coin investors and even low to mid risk ETF and stocks investors
966 2018-07-15 04:16:10 A lot of every day bigotry/implicit bias is white folks' ignorance. That can be corrected.  OTOH, being shamed on social media works much like the old stocks and pillory. It's a great punishment for unrepentant bigots.
967 2018-07-15 04:16:06 Most my colleagues had spoken many a word about hanging greedy bankers and they possessed neither stocks or homes.  They were simply angry that such men could so haphazardly wreck the economy, ruin the lives of millions, and make a profit.... and not just a profit.

969 2018-07-15 04:12:17 Thanks for sharing. I’m slowly developing my routine too. I’m just wondering if there’s any services that show you brokers upgrade/downgrades for stocks, like a centralized service so you don’t need to open multiple acc with multiple brokers?
970 2018-07-15 04:10:06 Me
971 2018-07-15 04:09:55 btw lmao if you think “investing” in stocks is somehow different than gambling. wagering money that an uncertain future event will or will not happen. owners of capital are not more intelligent or virtuous for winning/coming into money by chance.
972 2018-07-15 04:09:51 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
973 2018-07-15 04:06:20 Certainly not, but saying he made $11,000 an hour is a real dumb way of phrasing that. Most of his money was made from stocks. They don't budget out a 23 million dollar salary for him.
974 2018-07-15 04:05:25 I don’t have stocks I’ve always found stocks investments very exciting occasionally enjoy listening to reviews and business reports 
975 2018-07-15 04:03:42 Read government statistics? They benefited your wealthy donors. They aren’t doing much for people that are struggling to feed their families and keep a roof over their head and pay utility bills. Tax breaks are being spent buying corps stocks back. Wages have slightly declined
976 2018-07-15 04:03:30 At some point won't your shareholders demand you show more respect for the office of the President, even if it's only due to the fact that your ratings are in the toilet and it is hurting their stocks? Intelligent people would assume so. Your psychotic hatred must run very deep.

986 2018-07-15 03:51:09 Personally, at the very least I’d like to see universal background checks, funding the CDC to research gun violence, and digitizing the ATF’s records. I also like to see assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines banned.

994 2018-07-15 03:44:13 Can you recommend as well stocks to own for the next 48 hours? Man. Being a rag for neocon propaganda pays off big Bills, when is time to repent?!
995 2018-07-15 03:42:03 Honestly it makes me yearn for medieval justice. I can see him so clearly in arm and leg stocks, in the boiling sun, people throwing rotten produce and fecal matter at him, his glasses askew, dribble on his non-chin and tears running down his ugly face.

1001 2018-07-15 03:29:13 I'm curious... Have you found a new good paying job or received a pay raise? I'm not hearing a lot of people who actually have. Other than the CEOs. Of course the Bell has been steady, although less than when Obama was in. Do you have stocks? Are you benefiting from those?
1002 2018-07-15 03:28:30 But 75 % stocks are at discount to 25 to 45 % from their highs

W: reinstating assault gun ban, ban bump stocks, increase background checks
S: Expand background checks & higher CC standards. Treat gun violence as public health issue & regulate

1043 2018-07-15 02:30:36 I wish you could purchase stocks for upcoming rappers lmao I would invest in Gunna.
1044 2018-07-15 02:29:44 Tbh, I could get the Porsche now... but I'd rather recoup the home downpayment and dump more into my 403b stocks for the time being. Besides, my decal laden Ford is running strong aside from it pissing off the radio. >:(

1050 2018-07-15 02:24:17 Bravo to Trump creating an equal playing field across the board. As an investor in ASX stocks - I'm laughing. While he is in power I expect the US market to keep climbing towards 30k..and u can take that to the bank imo

1055 2018-07-15 02:18:10 Hello, I am  lynch with a quick news update. The Republicans are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  F stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNN.
1056 2018-07-15 02:18:00 “Better Off Now” hahaha. If you are rich white man, A corporation that Trump has stocks in or a country that wants to run/ruin us. Not if you’re an immigrant, a woman, a person of color, a LBGQT youth, a child in public school. #voteGOPout!
1057 2018-07-15 02:17:41 I have no idea how this all plays out, but I find it interesting that everyone has decided that there’s nothing to worry about in stocks until well after a yield curve inverts and then steepens again. Surely everyone will be able to thread the needle right? #macro #SPY

1060 2018-07-15 02:14:07 In Feb 2018, market dropping 7-8% in couple days got ppl feeling like “mini crash”. There will be a day where mkt drops 15-20% and many individual stocks 30-40%. People won’t have time to gradually de-risk or “get short” or buy cheap put options then.
1061 2018-07-15 02:12:58 We need to buy stocks in popcorn. Gotta feeling they will be going through the roof.
1062 2018-07-15 02:11:35 When your feet get cold. But you should buy stocks when earnings are at 7%, revenues/sales are at 10%, the company raises dividends every year, and insiders are buying the stock
1063 2018-07-15 02:10:51 I’m making a different point. Take the example of XIV, blew up in a day. What if overvalued stocks, which have levitated for years on thin volume/buybacks/algos/CBs, abruptly sell off hard. Institutions sell at once, gap down 30% in blink of an eye. You can’t “get short” after.
1064 2018-07-15 02:07:54 What is it that you hate about Trump? This is a man who gave up the life of a BILLIONAIRE to work for you. Under his leadership ISIS is decimated, taxes are lower for a majority of people, stocks at record highs, more jobs than workers, ...
1065 2018-07-15 02:07:07 Your stock expertise amaze us all.  Especially your ability too know who is buying what & that they are only buying their own stocks.
What other fortuneteller abilities do you have ?  Do you read tea leaves ? or just stock broker’s palms ? By the way Market is up from obama

But first tell me what will be bitcoin price in 2050..
Will it reach 1 bitcoin is equal to one million dollar in 2050.
1067 2018-07-15 02:06:41 At the right time ill be a vol seller on the q's.Currently i would own vol on the nasdaq. There are so many ways to play that as well and still have the same trade. I do sell 1-2 puts on jublfood, mcdowell every year as well. All stocks give that opportunity at some point in a yr
1068 2018-07-15 02:05:29 I don’t buy products/stocks thinking the business is going to support my political views and hopes for society. I assume they have selfish motives. With $TSLA, the problem is people assume Musk is an unselfish saint. It’s like when a cult finds out their leader is corrupt. Panic!
1069 2018-07-15 02:04:50 Blending comes with practice. Stocks and  wallpapers come from expensive gfx packs
1070 2018-07-15 02:02:16 I would sell the second one and accumulate the first... have been doing this for some years and Ola!!! It worked.. many of my midcap stocks still giving me 45-90% returns in this carnage also 
1071 2018-07-15 02:01:33 Thanks. Assume better returns in BN due to greater IVs. Would similar trades in nifty get 3 percent per month as against 4.5 in bn. The nifty 1sd trade might be a safer trade as well because swings are less wild also more stocks form the index.
1072 2018-07-15 02:00:13 $gnw i dont like trading financial stocks for some reason, none in particular just dont. Maybe its kinda how MLB players dont adjust to these shifts they are employing now.

1096 2018-07-15 01:16:59 The data shows S/V beats the market by approximately the same as stocks beat bonds, so 20% more from bond to stock has same return impact as 20% from TSM to S/V; that’s all I’m saying. DFA isn’t SV, it’s just a way to show live results cause Rick took offense to using index data
1097 2018-07-15 01:12:37 Well. He should be. Not that he lost that particular potential customer but because the stock price will drop. 
And that will potentially jeopardize some of the loans he has with stocks at a certain price level as security.

1120 2018-07-15 00:36:03 You guys are literally asking to make walmart a "crappy company" that no one will invest in. 1% own the most stocks as they have more money. Pretty self explanatory. However they are also smarter with their money which is why they have it invested.

1142 2018-07-14 23:49:10 Great for the 1% that can afford stocks. Jobs are lousy, minimum wage. The worst trade deals are yours, to be certain. Put tariffs on your daughter's crap, you hypocrite.

-@ColinFragale
1144 2018-07-14 23:44:42 What's happening is you gave the 1%-er corporations such huge tax breaks they're buying back their own stocks. That's why the market is hot. AND THEY'RE NOT CREATING ANY NEW JOBS. Taxpayers paid for Wall Street's sins, and it's Wall Street getting the biggest tax breaks!
1145 2018-07-14 23:43:46 WRONG! Bush put 2 wars on credit AND cut taxes. Trump cut taxes some more, mostly for people who don’t need tax cuts and corporations who are using the money to buy back stocks, not pay people more. And we STILL have those 2 wars to pay for.
1146 2018-07-14 23:41:19 Why on earth would they do that? Is investment income not income? Their wealth continues to grow precisely because the bottom 20% continue to toil for minimum wage further enriching those who can afford stocks and investments.

1150 2018-07-14 23:29:46 Trading preparation tip:

The first stocks I look at for the upcoming week are the ones that worked best for me in the prior week. We obsess over finding "new" trades, but why not first see if the stock that paid you last week is still in play? Keep it simple.
1151 2018-07-14 23:28:16 5 Stocks Oh God
1152 2018-07-14 23:28:05 gotta watch my stocks u feel me
1153 2018-07-14 23:25:08 2016-2017 : banks stocks will surge when rates rise.
2018 : cost of money is going up and it’s extremely competitive to get funds
1154 2018-07-14 23:23:49 And there’s times when stocks don’t beat bonds, but taking other asset class risks makes up the difference (see Lost Decade or 66-82). It’s all about a better/more consistent long-term outcome
1155 2018-07-14 23:23:41 It takes a year or 2 for policies to really have effect. We got short term stock boosts with tax breaks, but the market is still down from January. Worst of all its inflated by stock buy backs. Big companies are pouring money into buying their own stocks back.
1156 2018-07-14 23:22:09 The races tonight have been cancelled!!!

The makeup race for Midwest Street Stocks will be Saturday August 18th.  

Everyone who bought pit passes or front gate tickets will be able to use their tickets anytime between now and on Saturday August 18th.
1157 2018-07-14 23:22:06 Most girls out here investing their time into chasing a boy who doesn’t even treat em right. I’m out here investing in stocks. If he’s down for you, you’ll know bb.

1159 2018-07-14 23:18:49 If you’re my age consider a Robinhood account. Save 100$ a month and invest in stocks. It’s good money and gives you a nice jump on retirement.
1160 2018-07-14 23:17:52 This is a business news emergency broadcast. Today Executive Official  Steven Cahillane of  Kellog Company stated in a press release, "The Neutrals are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  FOSL stocks". Thank you for tuning into  Forbes.
1161 2018-07-14 23:49:10 Great for the 1% that can afford stocks. Jobs are lousy, minimum wage. The worst trade deals are yours, to be certain. Put tariffs on your daughter's crap, you hypocrite.
1162 2018-07-14 23:46:30 “There’s no point in having a girlfriend. You’re better off investing in stocks”
-@ColinFragale
1163 2018-07-14 23:44:42 What's happening is you gave the 1%-er corporations such huge tax breaks they're buying back their own stocks. That's why the market is hot. AND THEY'RE NOT CREATING ANY NEW JOBS. Taxpayers paid for Wall Street's sins, and it's Wall Street getting the biggest tax breaks!
1164 2018-07-14 23:43:46 WRONG! Bush put 2 wars on credit AND cut taxes. Trump cut taxes some more, mostly for people who don’t need tax cuts and corporations who are using the money to buy back stocks, not pay people more. And we STILL have those 2 wars to pay for.
1165 2018-07-14 23:41:19 Why on earth would they do that? Is investment income not income? Their wealth continues to grow precisely because the bottom 20% continue to toil for minimum wage further enriching those who can afford stocks and investments.
1166 2018-07-14 23:37:39 So many articles saying buy FANG stocks..if decentralized web takes off those are the first things that will get fucked . Gold is the other one they say run too. Like I said about ETH when they point you towards something run the other way. I'm staying put in crypto. GL 2 em
1167 2018-07-14 23:34:15 #equities #stocks #investing #trading #technicalanalysis and why bother? 5 year performance of #SPY $SPX is about +70%. 5 y gain of Momentum Ishares $MTUM is about 125%. Just following the money flows and avoiding the negative.
1168 2018-07-14 23:32:34 Do you get to choose the stocks you invest in?
1169 2018-07-14 23:30:53 How’s ur stocks doing since 2016?
1170 2018-07-14 23:29:46 Trading preparation tip:

The first stocks I look at for the upcoming week are the ones that worked best for me in the prior week. We obsess over finding "new" trades, but why not first see if the stock that paid you last week is still in play? Keep it simple.
1171 2018-07-14 23:28:16 5 Stocks Oh God
1172 2018-07-14 23:28:05 gotta watch my stocks u feel me
1173 2018-07-14 23:25:08 2016-2017 : banks stocks will surge when rates rise.

1181 2018-07-14 23:16:16 Megyn, lives on Camino Aeropuerto with husband and lots of kids.

Put all their savings into mango stocks. Can't retire.
1182 2018-07-14 23:14:25 A 65/35 stock and bond mix w/35% less volatility is in no way “riskier” than a 100% stock portfolio heavily concentrated in LG stocks, that’s for sure!
1183 2018-07-14 23:14:23 Agreed. Which is why I lean towards thinking a ban on bump stocks may be okay. They do not improve your ability to defend yourself or your home. They lower it while increasing the chance you'll accidentally harm others. Their only legal purpose is goofing off with firearms.
1184 2018-07-14 23:11:15 The studies are clear that the top 1% are reinvesting their tax savings in more stocks. The rest of us have stagnant wages and the “extra” $50.00 in pay check does help at all. I CALL BS!!!
1185 2018-07-14 23:10:57 Game 3 I had Miloni at 70% last stock when I had 2 stocks still, and I let him come back. It's cool that I beat Collinies, but I had a full stock to find one good hit and I blew it. So close to remembering what a good tourney feels like. Bummer.
1186 2018-07-14 23:09:50 Figured I'd drop some money and purchase a handful of stocks. Never invested in something like that before and I'm curious to see how it turns out - for better or worse.

Lookit me all growed up.
1187 2018-07-14 23:09:43 Canadians who own stocks in the soon to be legal marijuana market are being turned away at the US borders. WTF
1188 2018-07-14 23:07:36 The permutations were uncomplicated. Any "liberation movt" which was receiving assistance from SA was basically an enemy of the African people. This was why they swung their support in full for the MPLA whose stocks were on the rise under Dr Neto
1189 2018-07-14 23:06:24 If moronic tweets were punished, you'd be in the stocks being pummeled with fruit by mocking kids.
1190 2018-07-14 23:03:49 Lagavulin 16 is my favorite Scotch - I’m not sure if NC stocks Bunnahabhain, but I’ll definitely look for it.  Thanks for the tip! 
1191 2018-07-14 23:03:27 Fastest in LM hot laps:
Frye - 19.832, Axtell Jr - 19.978, Haus - 20.031, Miller - 20.150, Yoder - 20.177

XTreme stocks are on the track for our final hot lap session tonight.
1192 2018-07-14 23:02:53 Would u ask your stock broker to show proof that he bought the same stocks he advised u on? What’s the diff between that & a sports advisor?
1193 2018-07-14 23:02:31 34 Pro Stocks for the Homak Penn Ohio event at the New Stateline Speedway!  Good luck drivers!
1194 2018-07-14 23:00:54 I finally started investing in some low volatility stocks.  Just making $2-$5 and then reinvesting it when it goes low again.
1195 2018-07-14 22:59:23 Topshop stocks it
1196 2018-07-14 22:59:06 seems to me issuing common stock on blockchain is needed. legacy system allows rehypothication, a kind of fractional reserve for stocks.  They cannot even count votes for board directorships accurately.
1197 2018-07-14 22:57:21 Bump stocks hold a very weird corner of things. They're basically toys outside situations like we saw in Vegas where you're shooting into an incredibly dense crowd of people.

The cost in accuracy makes them safer for the target of anyone actually trying to hurt them.
1198 2018-07-14 22:56:21 Fixed it for you. Billy slater can’t put a foot wrong lately. His stocks are sky high
1199 2018-07-14 22:54:40 It's common sense not scare tactics. Look at their stock its 15cents. They are losing money and never will make money. 
$hmny
1200 2018-07-14 22:49:38 Not a bad idea. Remember to rotate your stocks.
1201 2018-07-14 22:47:56 I knowwww, Luma's just straight up unfair sometimes lmao. Rosa has amazing neutral, she's good at closing out stocks ( her FRIGGIN JAB kills around 130ish!! ), has one of the best juggle games AND also has that rage jank comeback factor 

Seems like a top 5 char to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1202 2018-07-14 22:47:09 No ..the reason is that all the stocks are imported from India .. I was in Pakistan and 80% of what was for sale in markets is from India ..
1203 2018-07-14 22:46:06 Time to strap on the old 'Stocks and head down my monthly shift at the Park Slope Co-op.
1204 2018-07-14 22:45:04 As proven sharks fins have no healing qualities and no beneficial chemicals at all for us humans, this finning if it proceeds at current levels will decimate our oceans for the next generations who could possibly starve due to zero fish stocks,sad but so true
1205 2018-07-14 22:42:20 Exactly.  Theres only about 20 stocks worth trading at any one time and don't need to scan day in and day out to know what they are
1206 2018-07-14 22:37:06 So I’m not really doing anything exciting right now, so I decided I’ll buy some stocks. I’m trying to figure out what stocks to buy. How am I going to this? I’m going to put the names of my favorite companies and a half, and then I’m going to pick one out. #ThanksCollege
1207 2018-07-14 22:36:07 He's referring to Canadian pot stocks not cryptocurrencies
1208 2018-07-14 22:34:56 #ASR looks to have a lot of support - I’ll check out the CEO . I wanted CEO names not just stocks
1209 2018-07-14 22:33:21 Alright, their service hours have recently been reduced. Service often goes out at 9 p.m., just when the operators close shop. They frequently refresh my signal to the cellphone tower, but cannot do anything about the cellphone tower being vastly overcapacity.
1210 2018-07-14 22:32:30 I have dumped 4 of my other otc stocks to increase my position at $celz.
1211 2018-07-14 22:31:57 Not gonna front, probably 20% into crypto, 70% into weed stocks, 1% for a Rhode mic arm, then 9% for fun
1212 2018-07-14 22:31:22 And the lag time from inversion to stocks peaking is LONG. Anywhere from 10 months to three years
1213 2018-07-14 22:30:14 #BetterOffNow I have no health care. I work two jobs and our country and president are laughing stocks.  #BetterOffBefore
1214 2018-07-14 22:29:36 Ayoko na talaga sa stocks 
1215 2018-07-14 22:29:09 Stocks and securities make up less than 13 percent of most companies revenue. Turns out capital gains really are the best.
1216 2018-07-14 22:29:05 @CocaCola Why advertise #CaffeineFree #GoldCoke everywhere, if nobody stocks it? It’s not in any small-medium stores, I’ve only ever seen it in massive superstores in large bottles or hospital shops in tiny bottles for ridiculous money. Please sell it everywhere, it’s my drink!
1217 2018-07-14 22:22:13 Lets be honest, with the right partner it could get something. So there will be 5 million on my banc account (also through the music and #collaborations). I spend in #stocks and for (now I am old and want just a little more luxus) a small house in or around #seattle and: FOR...

1220 2018-07-14 22:18:10 I “liked” Robinhood’s announcement but am I going to buy anything other than stocks and bitcoin on Robinhood? No. The zero commission is why I use Robinhood.
1221 2018-07-14 22:15:05 As we don’t have a plan B for the gk position it might make sense to include Stocks & Kruys next week with 1st team duties. We’ll need an experienced gk to start the season and I’d loan out CT.

1226 2018-07-14 22:05:01 Simply not true. Stocks are riskier than bonds and small/value is riskier than large/growth. They have both been positive about the same amt of periods and both yield similar overall premiums. Fama French didn’t develop a “primary” model & a “secondary” one. They’re all factors!
1227 2018-07-14 22:02:32 Assault weapons are already illegal. You mean ..bump stocks?
1228 2018-07-14 22:02:03 I am extremely nervous about today's game.
I think our defensive stocks are going to be stretched to the limit with the eagles tall forwards all in the side. I am feeling very uncertain
I just worry the massive injuries are going to catch up to us. #gopies
1229 2018-07-14 22:00:31 Welcome to real life. Definitely sucks but we’re just passing through til we get a home up high
1230 2018-07-14 22:00:22 We've reached the point where catastrophe is inevitable. Whining now will change nothing: chill out & get large stocks of popcorn in - the Fall will be a once in an epoch event of biblical proportions. Britain is finished, England is finished, only Scotland can save herself now.
1231 2018-07-14 22:00:19 Thinking about a candlestick chart for US stocks as two football teams, the green team is able to produce long sustained drives and has racked up a ton of yards. The red team occasionally makes a big play frequently but otherwise struggles to make first downs.

1234 2018-07-14 21:59:11 no, the company does not actually get any money, the owner of the stock gets the money, not the company.  If 1 million shares is GE are trade a day, GE gets zero additional capital because of it.  learn how stocks work, please.
1235 2018-07-14 21:51:42 Anyone good with trading stocks? Or into dropshipping? Need some help :)
1236 2018-07-14 21:51:18 You can't go up or appreciate it without going down. Like stocks, you will dip and rise but always grow, as long as you keep yourself desirable!
1237 2018-07-14 21:50:57 Go broke investing real estate , stocks shit that’s gone make you more money , not buying cars , clothes jewelry all that other bullshit that don’t mean nothing after you buy it.
1238 2018-07-14 21:50:20 Its the same exact thing that happens in scrims also, everyone just stocks up on things for the end game and just camps or tries to out live storm more than other team.
1239 2018-07-14 21:46:34 The second amendment was not created when AK-47s, AR-15s and bump-stocks were in existence nor could the founding fathers have the foresight to imagine just how sophisticated our weapons could become.  It is a mistake to assume that the 2A covers any "arm" you want to own.
1240 2018-07-14 21:46:27 Please check the stocks for yourself, he’s a liar. The market is crumbling.
1241 2018-07-14 21:46:20 @mystockedge hi
Kindly add screener as stocks above 200 dma and stocks below 200 dma. It will be most help full to combine scan to identify long-term bullish or bearish stocks
1242 2018-07-14 21:44:45 After the car accident, he brought the dog to the lake every day. His family grounded him, retrofitting his computer, so he could trade stocks online.

1243 2018-07-14 21:44:21 What stocks y’all think bout to take flight ?? 
1244 2018-07-14 21:43:24 We want good health insurance programs. Most Americans are not rich, you know. Stocks might matter to you, but to most of us...not so much.
1245 2018-07-14 21:42:54 The fact that my work stocks Amazon Echo and we’ve LITERALLY NEVER SOLD A SINGLE ONE just proves my hometown is a fucking prison full of locals and none of u deserve alexa anyway
1246 2018-07-14 21:42:15 regulations that are proposed. But I think waiting periods, extensive background checks, banning bump stocks, empowering law enforcement and the judicial system to take action when there's a mental health concerns, these can be useful actions.
1247 2018-07-14 21:40:40 They said WU fee to transfer 100$ is $30! Who still calls a broker to buy stocks? Can’t compare an ICO to an IPO. With $1000 you can trade more than 1 google stock through options
1248 2018-07-14 21:38:51 I never thought that 1998. would repeat in my lifetime, but playing the final match was beyond playstation #worldcup lol. Tournament football is different ballgame then league, like #trading listed stocks/OTC/forex/options. It's trading/football but different level
1249 2018-07-14 21:37:37 Gav, I think your misreading into my comments to think this was just an attack on TYM. It wasn't it was a general viewpoint on a number of stocks that is being falsely pumped despite placing after placing just because they are paid for PR.
1250 2018-07-14 21:37:21 Yeah, @LikesDaisy How do you sell stocks Saturday afternoon? I'm curious.
1251 2018-07-14 21:36:08 Well that's nice to hear. I wish people would chill with the big statements, though. Nothing's ever 100%
1252 2018-07-14 21:36:05 Start your own business and invest in stocks, etf, gold, bitcoin and real estate. Avoid private investments
1253 2018-07-14 21:35:54 My taxi driver was telling me how he sold 2 houses this year and just invested £93k in stocks, then had the audacity to charge me £9.50 go drive me 2miles to my rented house!!
1254 2018-07-14 21:35:12 Nah. Jon's been good. We're having a real conversation after he insulted my first tweet.
1255 2018-07-14 21:34:36 How many people own stocks?
1256 2018-07-14 21:33:49 I have an amazing offer, for each $10 you give to me, i shall give you $5 in return!

be quick while stocks last!
1257 2018-07-14 21:33:43 Two of Tennessee’s top 2019 basketball prospects—4* F CJ Walker and 4* PG Tre Mann—have seen their stocks rise over the last few weeks. The #Vols were very much in the mix early, but blueblood basketball programs are turning up the heat on them. Should be interesting to follow.
1258 2018-07-14 21:33:26 What if every time you treated yourself...you cut the amount in half you planned to spend. Then take the other half to put towards stocks. I imagine most people would have good money to put to work for them.
1259 2018-07-14 21:33:04 Lol. Gotta love hyperbolic bucks fans.
1260 2018-07-14 21:32:56 Yeah. I'm not really trying to deny interest in Parker. I just think you're making up a very small minority in saying they should have traded him earlier. Plus all those deals look way better now than they might have at the time.
1261 2018-07-14 21:32:42 Did they? Says who? And for what? Certainly not more than a future 2nd round pick.
1262 2018-07-14 21:32:34 It will last until stocks are sold out. If you want it you should get it as soon as possible possible to avoid disappointment.
1263 2018-07-14 21:31:16 Yea but also important to mention China stocks I. The tank and Mexico is insignificant rice eater China can’t stand your home town will cave in rice  eater
1264 2018-07-14 21:29:33 Appreciate the convo. Here’s my thoughts. Parker and Henson for Bledsoe. You kept Monroe and he would be off books now. Henson is moved and you freed up a lot more flexibility.  There was interest in Parker whether or not this was an option not sure but it’s the better move.
1265 2018-07-14 21:28:32 The stock market does not equal the economy. I wonder when it will be realized that stocks are over-inflated, meaning that the stock price is not worth the value...leading to a collapse.
1266 2018-07-14 21:28:07 
1267 2018-07-14 21:27:42 Save about a fifth for when I move out. Invest the rest, most likely into a few mutual funds since I’m not too knowledgeable about stocks yet
1268 2018-07-14 21:25:00 Use a calculator......if your share value drops below your investment buy in you lost money! Public interest is opposite of private stock. Stock return only works in private sector.....stocks will be worthless and anyone with sizeable portfolio can sue government 4 interference
1269 2018-07-14 21:24:08 Yes, and probably any strong hoppy beer. Tucher the better of the two German wheat beers Spoons stocks, though.
1270 2018-07-14 21:22:54 more tech skill, rage is nerfed, the game is faster so three stocks will most likely make a comeback and games will be less cheesy and comebacks will feel more earned. movement is buffed so mix ups and mind games will be even more important. more shied stun/less end lag.
1271 2018-07-14 21:22:37 I keep seeing these random “traders” aka people you pay $20 to do a 30 second video for you. Saying they made so much money day trading stocks from XYZ alerts  sounds legit!
1272 2018-07-14 21:21:24 This is a garbage response. The Bucks could have moved Jabari last season and had takers interested at this years deadline. Spare me with the emotional talk. This was 100% ineptitude on Horst and Co.
1273 2018-07-14 21:18:32 More stocks the better the arjuna and karna key chains gonna be sold out again XD
1274 2018-07-14 21:17:40 One thing most Americans don’t understand is that 80% of the stocks on the market are owned by just 10% of the wealthiest people in this country. These are the people whom Trump’s tax cut bill was designed to help, not working class people.
1275 2018-07-14 21:17:03 Hello farmers. I need help on how to deal with white fly. It's really bothering in the farm
1276 2018-07-14 21:16:00 US corporations patted themselves on the back after he tax bill passed by announcing that they were handing out bonuses (small bonuses in relation to what they got) to workers, but they used most of the money to buy back their own stocks and pay shareholders.
1277 2018-07-14 21:14:53 I agree that the stocks are their #1 priority. But, I think they care a lot about the ratings, and packing out buildings. They still want fans to care, but sometimes putting a belt on big money players (Rosey and Brock) will trump better storytelling
1278 2018-07-14 21:13:58 Man imma need for this ERBB and My other green stocks to gone head and hit the 10 dollar mark 
1279 2018-07-14 21:13:44 I love conservative men and women, always looking so smart. Too bad for @Uber for picking sides and not doing anything. Now there stocks will fall.
1280 2018-07-14 21:13:29 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1281 2018-07-14 21:13:14 You may very well be right. But for this moment in time until I see & hear guidence after the stocks report I will decide for me if I want to get in. Everyone has different goals & expectations. I have core holdings & a trading account. Right now I see better upside elsewhere.
1282 2018-07-14 21:12:13 So I bought like 6 indivuadal 20oz peach Fanta cause no one stocks cans or packs...yup

1288 2018-07-14 21:06:25 Stock margins as a % were higher pre 2017.  Stocks bolstered in 2018 due to stock buybacks from tax cut. Unfortunately only a couple of percent went to wages and workers. I had hoped for more. Equally distressing is added trillion to debt with no offsets. Very concerning.

1290 2018-07-14 21:05:04 I disagree on lack of strong fundamentals. I think, at least here in the US, economy humming along... but inputs are shifting all over... strange to sit at high's with such uncertainty... others say we would be much higher without. many stocks off considerably.
1291 2018-07-14 21:04:29 @waltshaub Nostalgic for last week that started with a Supreme Court nominee who likes to buy too many baseball tickets. Is there a store in DC that stocks these nominees, or have they started wearing corporate logos on their robes yet?
1292 2018-07-14 21:04:11 $TSLA is one of the best swing trade stocks. Have a high success rate with that one short and long. I wish them nothing but the best. $TSLA delivered. $AFMD has not. We should be so lucky to have a ceo like Elon. Data is one of the best I've seen. stock is under 2. Price pays!

1294 2018-07-14 21:02:15 Stocks been going up since 08 buddy, what deregulation do you think was enacted in 17 that worked so fast that your life improved in less than 12 months? Economy has been growing/improving for 9/10 years.
1295 2018-07-14 21:01:01 me: down with the monarchy sack the queen it's all a load of bollocks

also me: HOW DARE DONALD TRUMP NOT CHECK THE QUEEN IS OK AS SHE WALKS BEHIND HIM THE AUDACITY OF IT ALL THE PURE DISRESPECT HE HAS FOR OUR BRITISH VALUES PUT HIM ON THE STOCKS
1296 2018-07-14 21:00:58 Formula: 100 - your age = % in stocks, I feel doesn't consider Opportunity cost of different asset classes.  If there were 2 asset classes, cash & stocks, then, factors like the Q ratio, and the Risk-free rate on cash, should determine in theory, allocation, mathematically, imo.
1297 2018-07-14 21:00:24 Nobody’s selling funds here Rick, just correcting you for making obviously incorrect comments regarding the importance of stocks vs. bonds and small/value vs. large/growth, and showing you mountains of evidence for why you were wrong. Nice deflection though...
1298 2018-07-14 20:58:08 I'd much rather that Cohen be put in stocks, and every member of the military be given a free shot at his face.

Now that might actually teach him something.
1299 2018-07-14 20:57:55 Probably from the lockup rather than stocks.
1300 2018-07-14 20:56:37 Good luck with that, it looks yuk!

1304 2018-07-14 20:52:41 Donald do you remember when it was 26000 before you wrecked it and the Stock market has no benefit to your base unless the are able to buy stocks, which is unlikely, but given your Tariffs will effect them, we’ll see how long before you backdown
1305 2018-07-14 20:52:34 Ur missing the point. Let's say u were 65 in '08 & were expecting 2 retire w/in a yr. U should (would've) had maybe just 20-25% of ur nest egg in stock funds, rest in bonds or cash that weren't effected like stocks. Remember u started w $0 25, 30 or 40 yrs earlier.Still way ahead
1306 2018-07-14 20:52:26 Actually, inflation-adjusted wages are lower than 1979. Average tax increase is less than $1,000. Added deficit will be $1.5 trillion. GOP says, as a result, it will cut $24 billion from Soc Security and Medicare. Tax cut bill has primarily been used for buy-backs in stocks.

1308 2018-07-14 20:51:33 I dont think a lot of people realise this and take NHS staff for granted. A nurse I work with told me,  her son gets paid more than she does for placing stocks on shelves. Whilst shes out in the community saving lives. Its terrible. Honestly
1309 2018-07-14 20:51:09 Pillory & stocks too.
1310 2018-07-14 20:50:29 Every time I see a video of a white person calling the cops on a black person for existing I feel like we did away with the concept of shame far too early in our evolution. Maybe if we slapped a couple of these people in the stocks for an afternoon they’d stop being dicks.
1311 2018-07-14 20:47:02 Please straighten these folks out, bro... Dieter does not recommend stocks and all of us (at least the ones I’m aware of) make our own investment decisions (or have licensed professionals lending a hand)... #sheeeesh
1312 2018-07-14 20:45:28 Could you talk more about Forex/Stocks? Or do u have a separate account for that?
1313 2018-07-14 20:44:57 FWIW for those bulls initially worried $SGMO CTO exec leaving, it went down (so far, i know it's early) -3% on the news. that's really NOTHING. i have seen and actually own other stocks that go like -20% on news of exec leadership leaving
1314 2018-07-14 20:44:40 Incorrect assertion.  Homebuilder stocks and the Dow Jones Home Construction Index peaked in July 2005 and started off the cliff in August 2005. Housing starts fell off a cliff in January 2006.  The Fed/mortgage market and flippers fueled prices until 2007.  Kinda like now, eh?

1319 2018-07-14 20:40:28 Sanders has a private position on Wall St, too. It turns he heavily invests in the very stocks he claims he resents. So spare us. Now when will Sanders release the transcripts of his dubious meetings with communist leaders in Nicaragua, Cuba, and the former USSR?
1320 2018-07-14 20:40:23 My subscribers and I are making a small fortune shorting homebuilder stocks.  Talk about perma-bull-infused sector wrapped in debt and denial...
1321 2018-07-14 20:39:01 My fave part of this sign is that “below par” in golf is a good thing. You want a low score. Meanwhile, in investing “below par” refers to stocks that are performing poorly. 

Trump is a really bad businessman.
1322 2018-07-14 20:38:23 Most everyone made their money back by 2011, 2012 or 2013 at the latest. If u r close to retirement age most of your retirement savings should NOT be in stocks (higher risk yet higher long term rewards). More bonds.  Professionals know this & could manage our funds at low cost.
1323 2018-07-14 20:37:03 Rich people are definitely better off, the rest of us,  not so much. Real wages are FALLING. How does the stock market booming help people with no stocks, living pay check to pay check??
1324 2018-07-14 20:36:19 Did your mother never teach you “Ladies first?”
1325 2018-07-14 20:35:57 Why do most (including Fake News) talk about the DOW like it represents more than 30 stocks and plus the DOW has been at 25k at least a half dozen times this year.. which means no growth really in price at all this year
1326 2018-07-14 20:35:15 Once the stock moves from Daily Momentum to Weekly Momentum .... stocks become trustworthy ... there r no false indicators ! Kotak is in Weekly & Mthly Momentum .. i.e.  CCI 34  Mthly & Wkly >+100.
1327 2018-07-14 20:35:06 Yeah I’m out on DGI in a raising rate environment. I’m still adding stocks like T that pay 6% and sell covered calls on them for more income. The 2% yielding banks not bad cause they raising Divvy a lot. Consumer staples with 2% not worth it imo.
1328 2018-07-14 20:35:05 I have always thought stocks index and credit is better call on recession than yield curve. 
But yield curve as an indicator for stock market returns is something I struggle with and don't think it works well. As a front runner for recession yes but as to when it starts after

Extending your line of reasoning, that public disgust of paedophilia is simply close-mindedness, let’s also bring back cannibalism, suttee, witchcraft and the burning of witches, lynching of black people, the stocks and bestiality.

Presumably you agree?

1337 2018-07-14 20:27:14 Because the owners of the company would like to continue to see a return in their investment.   Do you own any stocks or mutual funds?

Hmm I think I narrowed it down by figuring out what I wouldn’t hate doing and what opportunities had high salaries!

1352 2018-07-14 20:14:41 Back to the bump stocks. You've obviously never fired using one. Not effective & reduce accuracy significantly. They're merely a novelty item, much like other tactical devices on AR-15s.  I can do the same thing with a piece of twine & a beltloop & it will be just as accurate.

1358 2018-07-14 20:08:06 Logic is that the whole US markets are now controlled and moved by the large cap FAANG stocks and a few more. So as long as They do the big buy backs and get more retailers in They will pump the indices Even further.
1359 2018-07-14 20:07:09 This week is going to point which direction we’re going. Top major stocks in each sectors have earnings this week. Depending on how they react to their reports will give a good indications of the future direction

1365 2018-07-14 19:56:26 They do. They buy other stocks, loan it to leverage vulture capitalists, send it overseas. Almost anything except resort to expanding US plant and employment. This is born out in the macro numbers such as durable goods and equipment sales.

1370 2018-07-14 19:48:51 Yes, the money is still flowing into FAANG

Should we take 5 stocks and extrapolated that market is robust?

It's strange how we all know the true to come but we're still trying hard to timing it

We could read a book or learn a skill instead
1371 2018-07-14 19:48:31 sure, constitution's "thou shalt have bump stocks to make your muskets aumotatic mass killing machines" ammendment mustve been forgotten about.

1382 2018-07-14 19:37:59 Boeing employees provided value to their company for decades, increased profits, then the company decided it didn’t need to provide as much value because it had leverage.

1391 2018-07-14 19:27:13 Around BestHairDeals/ Georgina Stores in Makola. You’ll get a shop that stocks these things. But for curved needles You might have to use IG. If you don’t mind, you could always get regular sewing needles. Works just as well.
1392 2018-07-14 19:26:50 You’re a joke of a franchise
1393 2018-07-14 19:26:24 Yes, it takes a lot of work and analysis to figure out which of those stocks, bonds or properties to invest in - with no guarantees for success / returns. Then you put that Capital to work with the risk of losing it all.
1394 2018-07-14 19:25:20 $CEI   current pps is .59 Buying at the bell, selling half for 1.75 and holding the rest forever!!! No debt oil company (unheard of) this news is HUGE! Next week will be massive! Going parabolic, could see and hold over 200% gains. good luck

1404 2018-07-14 19:11:53 It sets up great trading opportunities (both sides).  Have to be nimble and watch your positioning both in size of trades & number of positions, but no doubt re your argument.  Then there stocks that are unaffected, ie $CRM $AMZN

1406 2018-07-14 19:10:49 Stocks have fallen, Liar from over 26000. It's only up if you're standing on your head. U haven't made deals, you're just throwing tariffs at our allies and China.

1408 2018-07-14 19:09:34 Also, my perspective involves building less wealth, but more than none. Simple as that. Private prison stocks are booming right now. Never ever will that be worth it to me.
1409 2018-07-14 19:09:07 Wow. A while back it was said to be 1% of world stocks. Now it's 1.4%! The #Norwegians are taking over the world!
1410 2018-07-14 19:09:03 This is not how markets in large liquid stocks work. Sorry.
1411 2018-07-14 19:08:10 JC, is any historical evidence to support that stocks will do well when yield curve flattens?
1412 2018-07-14 19:07:18 you gave corporation 1.5 trillions as a gift to buy back stocks - that will all be added to the deficit
1413 2018-07-14 19:06:58 I have learnt not to trade some FNO stocks. They are manipulated either way underlying they show fake signals either due to low volume or players like to play this way. it's okay to be in less manipulated instrument and trade the same quantity in underlying.
1414 2018-07-14 19:05:32 That’s not how buying and selling stocks works.

1417 2018-07-14 19:03:20 I wonder if there are other apps Apple might integrate news into? While they don’t have a Sports app, they’ve done a lot work in Siri / TV app to support sports, and I think sports would be more popular than stocks.

1420 2018-07-14 19:01:16 I don’t agree. It’s simpler than that: the insiders, knowing that “the public” could sell a good amount of stocks if threatened by some news, put the price down during Cambridge Analytica scandal, for the purpose of accumulating $FB at better prices.

1423 2018-07-14 18:58:56 Shocking, a bond guy calling for a sell off in stocks. He is a smart investor but should stick to his market (bonds). He has been calling for a stock sell off for a while now. He will be right...eventually

1456 2018-07-14 18:30:40 The only true fact u have there is the interest rates are up.All the others are pure lies.

1463 2018-07-14 18:28:16 Wtf lmao. The NRA is saying we are trying to take away guns, but that isn’t true. The point of MFOL was to show that we don’t take corruption and we want stricter gun laws. An 18 y/o shouldn’t be able to have an AR-15 and we need bump-stocks to be banned.
1464 2018-07-14 18:24:59 Stocks - I used to call investing a sophisticated form of gambling. However, the odds are in your favor investing. Why? You <~ are in control. You can see what’s behind the company. Read the 10Q, Chart, Earnings, IR, P/E, prospectus, more. Life is a gamble.

1527 2018-07-14 17:19:57 the way that Marshall’s stocks shelves full of cheaply-priced things that i know i don’t need by the checkout line is truly rude

1529 2018-07-14 17:13:34 I swear, the next one who tells me they got an 18% return on their stocks and funds is going to send me screaming. They are so totally missing the point, and are so ME ME ME look what I did! Don't care about the "less wealthy" among us.

1532 2018-07-14 17:12:18 Demain, ce genre de faits sera mis dans les colonnes des faits divers des médias tellement il y aura des carnages dans les rues et les transports en commun chaque semaine par les tarés de Dieu. Habituez-vous et comme je l'ai déjà dit, faites des stocks de kleenex pour vos larmes.
1533 2018-07-14 17:11:12 After a great night last night let's do it again 2nite @MercerRaceway with me and @BrianLiskai in the booth 410s, mod lites & stocks
1534 2018-07-14 17:10:37 Someone ask me wat I trade & what I invest in #cryptocurrency.
Trade #Altcoin #Bitcoin (Long & Shorts!)
Invest in #Bitcoin
Invest in #Blockchain (via blockchain company stocks or ETFs)
Many ways to get exposure in this booming #crypto & #blockchain macrotrend. Be part of it! 
1535 2018-07-14 17:09:28 My argument is different - since its am uncorrelated asset, people escaping both from bonds and stocks might want to use it to hedge their chances. 
I'm not talking about people with "bills to pay during recession". 
And when everything is falling even a Bitcoin might look safe.

1537 2018-07-14 17:07:35 My claim of what??? That President is MAGA the economy is growing daily the stocks are up unemployment is down there are more jobs now than we have people to fill them. Or that Jesus has his hand on our President. Yes these claims are true. White the hate away.
1538 2018-07-14 17:06:37 What Can QE Tell Us About QT?
 
The full force of QT ($50 billion per month) has just begun, and there are signs that stocks and bonds are beginning to change direction...
1539 2018-07-14 17:05:25 I am in learning phase.

I have only 5% of my NW in equity(including stocks, MFs, ULIPs, NPS). I had even tried out options, keeping a cap of flat ₹10,000.

I will build it up as I get my act together.

My only regret is that I started all this in my mid 30s instead of mid 20s.
1540 2018-07-14 17:05:19 I've been saying this for ages: the tax cuts (and GOP economic policy) were great for CEOs, folks who own many shares of stocks, and friends of Donald Trump. But wages of average workers continue to stagnate, despite denials from conservative pundits.
1541 2018-07-14 17:05:02 It's time for another Race Day at Dodge City Raceway Park!

1544 2018-07-14 17:04:15 En vrai, fin de saison, faut écouler les stocks, etc 
Logique commerciale quoi :D
1545 2018-07-14 17:03:18 Hit 18 went straight to stocks 
1546 2018-07-14 17:00:46 But then you can’t pump and dump stocks...
1547 2018-07-14 16:59:30 The only 401k I ever had got destroyed when that bubble popped. (The account still exists; it’s got a few dozen shares of illiquid stocks in it that used to belong to a respectable aerospace company with an internet-in-the-sky play.)
1548 2018-07-14 16:59:28 IQ 7.7, NFLX 14.3. But IQ has competition (from Tencent), and also is nowhere near profitable. Also potential headwinds from overall Chinese stock market. And NFLX is frankly one of the elite, blue chip stocks in the world. IQ is great, but doesn't deserve that multiple yet.
1549 2018-07-14 16:57:05 Laughing stocks not qualifying pal
1550 2018-07-14 16:55:46 No that’s false.

This is cash owned by ONE party, Norway, invested in global stocks and companies.

BlackRock and Vanguard funds consist of money from OTHER people invested.
1551 2018-07-14 16:53:38 So your gonna ignore the fact that there is no valid argument in getting a refund for a poor decision made by you, your never gonna make it big as a business man if your gonna cry after making sht decisions. Come into the world of stocks and see how hard it gets.
1552 2018-07-14 16:52:16 Invited Russia to reveal details of their program and stocks.
Repeated that invite through OPCW where Russia, in breach of the CWC has not declared its program.
The official Russian position is that they had no program or stocks, so what assistance is it they can provide?

1556 2018-07-14 16:48:55 same applies to you safir,  you feel this upmove is eternal,  despite warning in the form of collapse of mid and small caps , infact most of the stocks except a handful
1557 2018-07-14 16:46:27 Then why are you in stocks? The incremental differential is not worth the return premium! Maybe better to stay in MFs or get better advise
1558 2018-07-14 16:46:10 Well, couldn't prove it by my stocks.  Started doing penny stocks, some suggested by Advisory sites, some stock of week reports on what to get now.  My balance went from 100.00 to  $46. then up to $52 and today is down to $43.  ,:(.  Guess a good thing only had sm AMT in it .
1559 2018-07-14 16:46:04 Wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1560 2018-07-14 16:44:14 My experiments with stock market is pretty decent. This is my first downturn.
Earlier I had returns of 20% on stocks picked against 17% on MF.

I also have learned the basic lesson: if I am actually getting an allocation in IPO, it’s probably a bad stock!

1563 2018-07-14 16:40:09 Plus you don't need to have millions to really benefit from dividends. Maybe they're just "crumbs" to you, but it matters for the lower class. Obvious. 

Truth is, those that stay poor for generations are buying lottery tickets instead of stocks. We need financial literacy.
1564 2018-07-14 16:39:25 People need to stop with the us economy gloom and doom - I’ve covered consumer stocks for years and the us consumer is in great shape / spending freely - no clue on oil prices but economic weakness is not an issue at this point in the us

1567 2018-07-14 16:39:02 MA often leads the way (health care, same sex marriage, banning bump stocks, etc.) - hopefully other states will follow!
1568 2018-07-14 16:37:22 Great points Jordan. I need to take a more active role in managing my portfolio. My primary goals are capital preservation with consistent growth. I am in a mix of blue chip stocks. ETF’s, a bit of cash.

1572 2018-07-14 16:31:24 It's really confusing this time because most stocks are Down & few nifty heavy weights are lifting the Index.

1574 2018-07-14 16:26:47 The NASDAQ and Small Cap index have beaten the SandP 500 over time. An index is a group of stocks picked by people. You don’t think anyone can do it better than sandp?
1575 2018-07-14 16:26:38 @RolexOwnersClub been trying to get a 2018 GMT Master 2 116710LN from several AD. But no stock until now. When will Rolex start releasing stocks? This has gone on for years now. And has artificially increased the prices of several models.
1576 2018-07-14 16:26:08 Got back to studying detailed price action this morning; wow I got lazy over last month or so. Can't wait to get back to it on Monday though. #study #stocks #priceaction
1577 2018-07-14 16:25:59 2017 worst jobs record since 2010, stocks are about 3 % for the yr and your trade deals...oh wait, you haven't made any!
1578 2018-07-14 16:25:46 And it's what keeps our economy growing in the 2 to 3 range instead of higher. Nobody has money to spur economic growth. Right now we have fake inflated stocks by buybacks. A couple of years from now will be different.
1579 2018-07-14 16:25:39 In fact stocks accelerated the move upwards in the final phase

1581 2018-07-14 16:23:23 $bkc top holding is $nvda, with an average price close to $240. Yet @BKBrianKelly is bearish on stocks. Hmmm conflict of interest? @MelissaLeeCNBC
1582 2018-07-14 16:22:42 Stocks are high because corporation are buying back stock not giving workers raises. Who are you fooling?
1583 2018-07-14 16:22:37 I almost solely shop at our mom-n-pop store now. Try mentioning what you would like them to carry. The owner stocks whatever I ask for. 
1584 2018-07-14 16:21:15 It’s crazy. In June, Jeff Bezo’s made around 40 billion while the average amazon employee made 12,000. He doesn’t care about his employees like his customers. Amazon also lowered the amount of stocks we get after 2 years because they’re worth more now.

1587 2018-07-14 16:18:29 Why is WILBUR ROSS quickly selling off his stocks ?
1588 2018-07-14 16:17:56 Yep. Until tom. I'm just not sure if stocks are replenished. Madali lang magpunta.
1589 2018-07-14 16:16:50 So, you're saying I should move it down a notch and be looking for the 100 000%? . The days of those gains are over. The reward for being in so incredibly early. But doubling, tripling, 10xing investment still totally feasible. Still a much better vehicle than stocks that way.

1591 2018-07-14 16:16:22 To be honest I wasn’t aware of it. I did v well on TYM when it went berserk and de-risked a few times so I just hold stocks like this for the long term.
1592 2018-07-14 16:13:21 Remember this:

Chasing stocks rarely works. You can’t buy when you get more excited.
1593 2018-07-14 16:12:14 Yo creo que serán muy buenos los resultados después del anuncio que hizo cuando se disparó hace un mes de que incrementaba precios a proveedores. Pero el trimestre pasado batieron todo y subieron estimaciones y bajo un 4-5% y estuvo tonteando . A ver que pasa .
1594 2018-07-14 16:11:20 No way to predict ER. $NFLX had one downgrade Friday morning, which is why the stock was down, but this was after nearly every other analyst upgraded it. However, analyst opinions hardly ever correlate with how a stock does when it reports earnings. I only trade stocks post-ER.
1595 2018-07-14 16:10:43 No, money laundering, bilking suppliers, declaring bankruptcy and using foreign money. He started with millions. He would have more if he just invested it in stocks. He lost money.

1603 2018-07-14 16:05:04 These actions drove retail investors and some short sighted institutional accounts away from the sector.  World facts didn’t matter. O&G stocks got marginalized by the prior renewable energy pitch before marijuana stocks appeared and caught the imagination of investors.
1604 2018-07-14 16:03:43 Pretty sure higher highs and less stocks making new highs isn't such a good sign :)

1606 2018-07-14 16:02:45 I’m wondering how this action compares to other bull markets?  I know there has been plenty of other bull markets where a handful of stocks are responsible for most gains.  Wondering if you have a historical comparison?
1607 2018-07-14 16:02:37 You have all sorts of #ETFs and #mutual#funds out there, and they can all advertise. The companies that run these funds want your money. And one of the biggest mistake you can make as an individual investor is to give it to them, with a few significant exceptions #trading #stocks

1616 2018-07-14 15:54:53 Up .38%, it's been fluctuating for some time now, it's been a bull market since before you became president & it will crash eventually, probably from some stupid move on your part. Most people don't own stocks so market is not a big economic indicator.
1617 2018-07-14 15:54:38 Hahaha we actually do. I sell 1 -2 puts every year to cover the costs of tickets and popcorn and i know stocks not going down as long as i am still watching and eating popcorn

1625 2018-07-14 15:47:39 @CndStockTrader first thank you for all your advice. Now I'm a lot better trader and making small but regular amount every week with your technique. I just have a question. Where do you get your technical data for stocks in your software?
1626 2018-07-14 15:47:36 If Aubrey Drake has some stocks I need in fast investment
1627 2018-07-14 15:47:17 It’s funny, cause this is the exact mentality I have, until I’m down 4 stocks to 1 like “let me just take one plz”
1628 2018-07-14 15:47:12 Further, O&G stocks are overcoming years of gov’t and media hype that fossil fuels are being replaced and renewables are the future. This narrative was being constantly perpetrated while world oil demand was growing and consumption was heading to 100 million bbls/d.
1629 2018-07-14 15:45:21 do you really think earnings and fundamentals matter to these stocks? 

the bigger they become, the more flows they attract from passive investment, that in turn make them bigger and hence attracting more passive flows and getting bigger, an so on...
1630 2018-07-14 15:45:18 Craft??
1631 2018-07-14 15:44:57 83% of benefits go to top one percent. Companies aren’t investing in workers but instead in buying back stocks. All while increasing our debt by 1.7 trillion. I guess being fiscally conservative isn’t a thing anymore. When the economy is doing good you don’t decrease taxes.
1632 2018-07-14 15:44:47 Sameee! But I think a broker is only necessary if you don't know how to buy stocks? I'm not sure though but I know that if you buy stocks through the internet, you'll definitely need a broker
1633 2018-07-14 15:44:36 Believe me, there are many other awful stocks out there. As an example, DCTH destroyed investors' stake time after time (including myself). You're not alone.

1637 2018-07-14 15:40:52 You are not allowed to complain my buddy, but you will get lots of the blame when the stocks are not rebounding next year. Strange but true.
1638 2018-07-14 15:40:37 Lots of people do well investing in individual companies. Look at returns of tech over the past 8 years. Over that time, one could massively beat indexes by overweighting one or more tech stocks and not rebalancing. AMZN, FB, TSLA, NVDA, NFLX, all grew from 8x to 50x since ‘10.

1652 2018-07-14 15:27:05 Did you hauL all your skincare, too? Or do you have stocks in Vancouver?
1653 2018-07-14 15:26:56 I’m surprised investors think rising profits & falling volumes affirm the business model. Could be a classic sign of over earning & that demand is in fact elastic. Also these stocks now trade at an EV of 5-to-6x sales, versus sub 1x when the post settlement total returns began.

-Being bearish on banks and cyclicals Vs defensives does NOT mean being bearish on the S&P! 
-- I am well net long stocks,sectors matter. 
-- I have long dated index puts for protection (Not SPX) 
--SPX could easily make ATH's, watch internals.

1668 2018-07-14 15:15:36 U.S. stocks and bonds now account for nearly 60 percent of global investment portfolios, even though the U.S. economy—though the largest—accounts for less than one-fifth of global GDP. Truth hurts doesn`t it.
1669 2018-07-14 15:12:46 You KNOW the truth but its convenient to ignore it.. Stocks buy back ONLY help the CEOs, and its shareholders, companies are STILL finding safe havens bc there was no punitive measures in place nor were loopholes blocked. Welcome to Corporate welfare season in America..

How do you get anywhere?  Who is making cars and/or driving cabs or any mass transit.  Who stocks the grocery store shelves you now have no way to get to?  Hell, who delivers the food to the stores?

“Never work!  Die in the streets instead!”  Good campaign slogan.
1707 2018-07-14 14:45:29 “Selling options bears the same theoretical risk as the underlying (stock/future), yet the value of the option will almost always move more slowly than the outright. Same risk, slower speed.”
From a book I’m reading.

1708 2018-07-14 14:42:55 If Indexing distorted liquidity, volatility and pricing of ANY stocks, it would distort those variables across ALL stocks. 

And certainly active management would have more impact on them than indexing.

1736 2018-07-14 14:21:45 I trade gold stocks not gold. Commodities and commodity stocks trade on differently.  However, IMO gold has started a new emerging uptrend although current price action would lead us to wonder.  For now I operate under that premise.  Gold stocks look better than gold 4 now
1737 2018-07-14 14:21:14 Wouldn’t indexing distort the liquidity, and volatility, of some stocks and, through them, distort prices?

1762 2018-07-14 13:59:52 There were no total market index funds either, or bond funds for that matter! Yet we always use their index data when discussing historical returns.

1818 2018-07-14 13:03:59 This sounds fishy. Wilbur Ross, the secy of commerce just made a bundle shorting his stocks. Auto makers should be concerned their secrets are actually for the good of Wilbur and Don the Con's pockets!

1826 2018-07-14 12:55:35 It's a good passive income for musicians/composers/songwriters etc. It's also good because it builds over time, almost likes stocks/shares/pension funds.

1899 2018-07-14 11:50:13 It is interesting but a bit of apples and oranges comparison. Also the oil fund barely holds cash at all. It would be insane to hold that much cash. The value is held in bonds, stocks, real estate etc. So it has $1T in assets while Aramco IS a $14T asset.

1903 2018-07-14 11:47:52 #2018 has seen an euphoric rise of #largecap stocks...and many retail investors have started pulling their money from fundamentally good mid/small cap stocks and buying latgcaps. But euphoric rise is always balanced by a steep corrections just like what #smallcaps are dealing nw

2038 2018-07-14 08:29:46 Glad I pruned my bank stocks early last week. My gut instincts were right. I think theres an element of intellectual dishonesty in share buybacks somehow.

2055 2018-07-14 08:08:45 An Index is supposed to represent a diversified view on how a universe of stocks is doing. The Banknifty, which almost solely represents the performance of HDFC Bank, by no stretch of imagination does that. Some serious rethinking needs to be done on this index

2066 2018-07-14 07:55:36 It is difficult to find 4-5 stocks on Indian context.  That’s why people diversify into 25-30 stocks, in the hope that 5-6 would really be good.  The rest negates their growth into negative returns

2102 2018-07-14 07:11:38 The bull case consists of post-hoc justifications for the ridiculous valuation it already has.  This is just an example of the greater-fool theory, and the greater fools are average people who could only think of a couple stocks to buy via Robinhood.  Netflix is always one.

2115 2018-07-14 06:55:26 Sir, Interesting Phrase indeed!!

 “Those with the enterprise haven’t the money, and those with the money haven’t the enterprise, to buy stocks when they are cheap".
2116 2018-07-14 06:55:25 How new leaders are born so quickly. It’s people like you advisors and operators take the stocks up and later dump it. Investors do not get trapped
2117 2018-07-14 06:50:55 Slightly off topic but is it necessary to have diversification in the momentum portfolio by capping exposure to single sector?

2127 2018-07-14 06:37:52 The manipulation is by increasing weight of stocks which are going up and reducing weight of those which are going down. That's the most ridiculous way of making a representative "index".

Boring (low-risk) and excellent long-term stocks are not deemed investment worthy as they don’t have the “casino-investing” element!!

Erm we Indian armys were wondering when the app would be released in India. Also, if you did, your stocks would go up a huge number because India's population is very high and the number of armys here too. Please consider india too?
Thanks

2237 2018-07-14 03:59:31 Good idea, but try financial planning and investing. Stocks are ok if you have a 7 figure portfolio, but a few ETFs are all you need, regardless of your net worth. The more you learn, the more you will realize that simpler is better.

2251 2018-07-14 03:44:19 The only really safe way to short stocks is to buy precious metals, here. Because,once the Dow is down at least 30%, they will spring negative rates on us. Trump will probably demand them even sooner, around 25%. In dollar terms, stocks could then do what they did in Venezuela

2279 2018-07-14 03:14:31 and your example, and the whole idea, don't reflect the reality that gains on assets like stocks are going to rise proportional to inflation anyway (as the nominal revenue of the underlying companies rises) so the current situation is a wash

2292 2018-07-14 02:55:32 Buy stocks in quality companies that actually produce things people buy and make money, that have wide moats around their business, that produce shareholder value and dividends. Buy them and hold them forever.

2294 2018-07-14 02:51:52 I would say this...the ten years you reference in which you lost money would have been 2000-2010, based on your original tweet. Very tough period for stocks, so that part of your portfolio would have suffered anywhere.  And Wells has the same fee structure as ML.

2300 2018-07-14 02:46:34 I’m just lucky that I’ve been eaten out by someone who has stocks in dominion and they didn’t manage to suck the soul out my bod while they were sucking my clit THATS all I can say
2301 2018-07-14 02:46:14 Aren’t Russians right now buying up technology and stocks in Silicon Valley companies? They’re investing in Facebook and twitter through Kushner right now. They never used to be able to do that.

2304 2018-07-14 02:44:56 So we can now plausibly state that social media is a very useful psyops tool to both steer votes and destabilise stocks in publicly traded companies.

Not surprising consider B-list celebs in 2007 were hiring rep and sentiment manipulators, with successful outcomes.

2306 2018-07-14 02:41:12 You have been sneaking into the Kool-Aid stocks again Lindsey. The Brits are enraged with Trump, but too polite to create a scene. However, next time Trump wants something from U.K., he may find a very slow and grudging response to his and our needs, if he doesn’t stop offending!

2311 2018-07-14 02:37:01 Fair, I find it silly too to a degree, but for significant portions of the year it's a hell of a lot easier to trade than stocks
2312 2018-07-14 02:36:18 First a national red flag law that allows guns to be taken away from rapists, domestic abusers and other violent criminals. I also would like a ban on bump stocks. And nationwide background checks.
2313 2018-07-14 02:35:59 Overall market looks healthy but does the increased price acceleration in big leading stocks such as AMZN, MSFT concern you or you actually see it as more bullish? looking forward to the weekend video!
2314 2018-07-14 02:35:25 I've been holding $ADA and $XLM since they were .02c If they actually get listed on Coinbase after the review, the bullrun will be very aggressive.

2345 2018-07-14 02:08:23 you can disagree all you want, but history shows you that stocks over the long time goes nothing but up. That is the point of the tweet. Sure some traders can succeed trading short, but very few can make a long career of just doing that (some do as I stated).

2349 2018-07-14 02:00:25 In the 2000 tech bust, AMZN went from $113 to 5.  I expect many overvalued stocks to do the same this time around—including Tesla.  The cars don’t really matter.  Financials matter more.
2350 2018-07-14 01:56:39 Ig told me that most small stocks would hardly be affected as the  margins already start at 25%. It wouldn't apply to ecysting positions. And the change in protections might mean little in practice.  Unless trading other markets it's pretty marginal and you can change any time.

2357 2018-07-14 01:46:11 It taxes transactions on Wall Street.
Most people buy stocks & bonds & hold them, so this will mostly affect high speed computer speculating done at large financial corps trying to game the system. These trades make the market more volatile anyway.

2364 2018-07-14 01:42:21 Exactly, I like when my stocks rip and the other day retest their inteaday pivots and bounce, that's a sign of strength. Btw nice comparison Ben! I don't mind if they follow-through the very next day but tbh it makes me just more cautious because it may be a liquidity event.

2377 2018-07-14 01:30:39 Value investors buying Blue Chips at good valuations can consider themselves lucky if they get 1-2 stocks an year.
If you get 3 ideas in a year you have hit the jackpot.
Building a portfolio of long term growth stories is a slow and perhaps a boring process.
2378 2018-07-14 01:30:33 It’s laggy and, because it is a point in time thing, it depends a lot on state of economy and laws at that moment. Overall seems better to tax stocks rather than flows.

2382 2018-07-14 01:28:17 Yeah, but companies are buying back stocks at a faster rate.  Corps before people
2383 2018-07-14 01:27:42 They are the ones stocked up on huge magazines, tons of ammo, bump stocks, and AR15s so I say YES they go first.
2384 2018-07-14 01:27:00 Someone just say this to me

It happens when stocks get returned. Gaon shows how many albums a company ships and when albums don't get sold, they're returned and Gaon adjusts the numbers. They're still certified platinum and will probably hit 300k again soon.
2385 2018-07-14 01:26:21 Not even the stocks?
2386 2018-07-14 01:26:14 Human mind wants instant gratification. Don't expect  +ve returns immediately & consistently.
One has to wait for years to see good growth with intermediate period of no or -ve returns.
Those who cannot withstand volatility in stocks should invest through equity MFs.
2387 2018-07-14 01:26:13 I dunno, buying stocks and bonds isnt that "easy" either. Maybe theres a need for crypto brokers.

2427 2018-07-14 00:39:59 Pretty sure that it all started with a solar city short seller by the name of jim chanos.

2442 2018-07-14 00:27:27 It's a hard cycle to break.  I sold Ped .32 to .65 initially.  It was tough to see it go to $3+ the same day.  But end of the day.  How many stocks go 500% in 1 session?  It's about having a healthy control over greed.  We all struggle with it.  I definitely do.

2466 2018-07-14 00:08:15 Hmm, no one really knows exactly the numbers and such but one of the way they can do is to cut a lot of the upper managements (CEOS and such)'s pay, convert them into stocks and pass on the wages below. That's always doable. Raise the minimum wages from $11 to $15 as well.

2537 2018-07-13 23:21:34 Say you buy 100 shares at 50. 
Or sell a 48 put. Stocks drops down $2. 
With the short put, you might be down like -$100. With the stock, you’ll be down -$200. 
So, again, you take on less risk with the short put. 
Simple example w/o all the complex math. But to prove the point.
2538 2018-07-13 23:20:08 As a new investor I learned a lot of lessons on these ongoing SME stocks corrections. Portfolio should be balanced with all types of stocks and need to ready for all corrections. #indiastocks #nse #bse #indianequity
2539 2018-07-13 23:18:14 I’ve said it before, but it never ceases to amaze me how many people think a short put is more risky than long stock. 
Like c’mon man. They give shorting options such a bad reputation. It’s messed up.

2541 2018-07-13 23:14:29 Stocks have been fun for the last 100 years. Invest in America. So many great companies doing things that no one talks about. Best in their fields. Crushing it. Why not own them?
2542 2018-07-13 23:14:13 This is the real reason the average American is bearish stocks.

Median household income is like $43k and you are out like $300k on 1 median home and 1 median car.  Let me know when you start loading up on stocks that are 7x levered, because that's the average American.
2543 2018-07-13 23:12:48 Millennials: don't listen to the doom and gloomers. Invest in yourself. Buy stocks. Reinvest the dividends. Get more training. Invest in your career. Live long, and prosper.

2547 2018-07-13 23:11:46 No, as per the nuclear cooperation agreement the construction of nuclear weapons is entirely up to AWE. We've also have our own stocks of nuclear material. On some occasions, fissile material has been exchanged between the UK and US, ie UK got uranium in return for plutonium.

2549 2018-07-13 23:11:18 If you've been following me, you know that I tweet about hundreds of stocks. Not all are winners. Goal is to have more winners than losers. Or just buy the indexes. That's easy. 15% return annualized on the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. That's a secular bull market in action.
2550 2018-07-13 23:10:30 @sassyoptions is there a general rule of thumb you follow during a monthly opex week? like stocks are more likely to pin, etc?

2564 2018-07-13 22:56:09 Btw, you like to say gold stocks are “dirt cheap”, but you never give numbers to back that up. (short interest and gold index comparisons to other years aren’t valuations). I’ll bet you can’t name 3 gold stocks cheap on FCF metrics & give numbers.

2602 2018-07-13 22:27:49 People don’t eat their stocks. So for those who spend the dividends, that’s great. But for the rest of us, a job, or a profitable farm, is what is required. And if they spend their dividends, they’re going to be spending of a lot more of them on cars, washing machines, etc.
2603 2018-07-13 22:27:06 How did they get the money to afford the entire building to rent out rooms? Or get the money to invest in stocks in the first place? Interest is a precentage, so the more you have the more you get. Inheritance doesn't last that long if you don't work to maintain it.

2628 2018-07-13 22:06:29 I read an article by a very respected financial analyst a few years ago. She stated that she had run the numbers, and if Trump had've invested the 1 billion he inherited in blue-chip stocks he'd be worth 8 billion. Instead of that he used his amazing skills to turn it into 2 Bill
2629 2018-07-13 22:06:08 Maybe someone should let @IvankaTrump know this... she thinks the tax scam has made middle and low income workers richer. She doesn’t believe the tax break went to buy back stocks or make the rich richer, enlighten her Sen. Sanders.

2639 2018-07-13 21:57:03 Yeah but if they didn’t acquire those companies those companies them selves would have ipoed and the value created would be by a lot more stocks

2675 2018-07-13 21:21:45 $SPY green on the day, but just couldn't bust through that $280 level. Will be key to watch that level into next week, and how prices react from here. Have a great weekend everyone! #Trader #stocks #weekend #FridayThe13th #OptionsTrading #lovemyjob #Profits #FridayFeeling
2676 2018-07-13 21:18:21 Hello, I am  maxie with a quick news update. The Politics Advocates are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  K stocks. Thank you for tuning into  BBC.
2677 2018-07-13 21:16:44 Discussing Social Chatter Rankings of Stocks today with @OJRenick  and @TDANetwork Here's the top stocks that made the list #1 BTC, #2 IQ, #3 HMNY, #4 AMZN, #5 NFLX
2678 2018-07-13 21:16:27 Take another look at what it does. Think of Las Vegas and bump stocks. This “enhances fire power” and I don’t like the message it conveys to kids. 

And I’m not anti-gun. I’m anti-stupid.
You be you. You will anyway.
2679 2018-07-13 21:16:08 Day 4/5 of re-transforming, growing overnights, and making glycerol stocks of the 65 plasmids I made this year into the freezer. whoops!
2680 2018-07-13 21:15:50 I've done well this year doing bullish spreads in 8-10 tech stocks (PYPL, AMZN, SQ, NVDA, AAPL, CRM). Thinking of taking a more neutral position selling in the money call spreads. I'm expecting another sell the news earnings season. Thoughts?
2681 2018-07-13 21:15:47 If super poor people owned stocks this would affect them A LOT. But, of course, they dont. But retirees are similar to poor people even when they arent, so things like this can affect them unless you give all retirement benefits equally regardless of income (arguably a good idea)

2686 2018-07-13 21:12:36 Sir then what is Sahi for retail investors who are not involved in stocks?
2687 2018-07-13 21:12:33 You think hes helping the black when he says theirs good people on both sides? The economy was rolling before he took office. Stocks and unemployment trends have continued, they have not started. On trade, he is alienating allies and starting trade wars. This is all wrong guy
2688 2018-07-13 21:12:19 What YOU need to "realize" is there's much more money is individual stocks. You also "could have" or I should say, would have made $100,000 in just 5 days if you traded side-by-side with me on the $QLYS trade in June or $150,000 in just 9 days on the $SHAK trade or $GOOS, etc..
2689 2018-07-13 21:11:21 anyway, this is one of the reasons most retirement accounts buy mutual funds instead of straight stocks, because its easier to control the drip. But my dad did OK and has stocks and if one paid him out a lump sum it would cause him problems. If its big it might solve them too
2690 2018-07-13 21:10:44 The "tax reform" added another trillion to the deficit and 83% of the benefit went to the richest people in the country, not regular people.

We now have less money for things like schools and roads so that corporations could buyback stocks.

2698 2018-07-13 21:06:26 I am thinking the two have behavioral offsets, too.  Min vol works bc investors prefer higher risk stocks, and momentum sort of captures that preference?

2873 2018-07-13 19:36:50 Something cannabis stocks have taught me. Its very easy to manipulate a valuation when you have some big money behind you and the ability to lock up a great deal of your shares. This isn't in reference to anyone specifically, but something new retail needs to really understand.
2874 2018-07-13 19:35:29 I used to trade it last yr, made some profit. Looks like a classic pump and dump penny stock scam. I typically avoid penny stocks now.
2875 2018-07-13 19:34:45 It’s foreign exchange trading. It’s sorta like investing in the stock market but instead of stocks your just investing into currencies. So as long as people are exchanging currencies all over the world, then you can make tons of money off it if you learn to invest right.

2923 2018-07-13 18:55:54 One week ago, I bought 2 small puts: AMZN at 1700$ and NFLX at 400 $ .It secures my portfolio old economy, because the spread between old and new stocks is unbearable...At the end of August the sword of Damokles is falling on Chinese head. So we are on thin ice and I will reduce

2928 2018-07-13 18:50:03 Agree you can get good cheap.  However, that is a small minority of the cheap stocks.  Most stocks that are cheap are that way for a good reason.  You can find good quality stocks that are cheap.  Hard to find but they crop up occasionally.
2929 2018-07-13 18:49:39 @RevShark is the market really in good shape or just the 5 stocks that have driven the index ?

2931 2018-07-13 18:46:38 Near-perfect, if boring, symmetry: A few moments ago 1,482 NYSE stocks were up for the day, 1,482 were down, and the NYSE composite index was nearly unchanged (+0.07%).
Zzzzzzzzzz.....
2932 2018-07-13 18:45:38 Today, I said bye to $SRPT. That was nice steady ride to the top but one needs to know when he has to close a position, rebalanced in Chinese tech stocks, $MONO, $IQYI
2933 2018-07-13 18:45:23 Definitely loving the annual "Charges & Compensation" reports that all clients receive in January, it's keeping financial advisors way more honest & transparent! #yvr #investing #fees #stocks
2934 2018-07-13 18:45:14 So nobody noticed when stocks in for-profit prisons went up as soon as Trump was elected? Somebody had to fill them.
2935 2018-07-13 18:44:29 I have a shop here in togo where i sell artificial folwers for all ocasions. Im just looking somebody who can supply me with goods enough for me to bring back my bussiness to live.
Maybe if you have some old stocks if goods you want to lease out, i will be glad to have them.
2936 2018-07-13 18:44:24 XOM is used as a driver, like the futures. High short interest stocks are not taking a "hit" These are the absolutely most desperate times in covering the shorts. After earnings and another 30MMbl lower inventories. It'll be that much harder.
2937 2018-07-13 18:44:13 "Third World" OMG get down in the basement and start coloring. 
Don't be such a 'drama Queen' Ian, you're being fooled #WalkAway 
For a 3rd world country the economy, jobs, GDP and stocks look really good. 
Please enlighten me as to your 3rd world???? #Trump2020Landslide
2938 2018-07-13 18:43:37 The risk is that #SMT have ridden a wave that may come to an end soon. Some of #SMT's holdings do give me pause for concern.  On balance, though, #SMT shows that picking good companies is a great long-term strategy IMO i.e. as opposed to picking "cheap" stocks.
2939 2018-07-13 18:43:16 Watching stocks on a Friday is similar to watching paint dry... 
2940 2018-07-13 18:42:56 That was a 96.5 million dollar N-word! I would apologize too! Those stocks took a deep ocean dive hit!

2947 2018-07-13 18:38:54 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood any chance of getting an "earnings central" on the web/desktop site sometime?  like a calendar of current week and next week with all my owned & watched stocks that have coming earnings reports?  Currently I only see that I have to stock to stock
2948 2018-07-13 18:38:01 Blame the WSJ for bringing it up. Guess they need to stick to stocks.
2949 2018-07-13 18:37:56 Stocks for the longer than you thought run.
2950 2018-07-13 18:37:53 S&P500 is heading higher but 10/20 stocks in the top 20 traded stocks are trading with a negative bias. Even Bullish stocks are just marginally positive
2951 2018-07-13 18:37:11 I'm baffled that Walt Disney stocks are as low as $100. I need to get some Disney stocks!!
2952 2018-07-13 18:36:24 You know how many people have a 401k? How many invest in stocks, bonds, index, all that mumbo jumbo. AVERAGE Americans do not have pensions, 401k, IRA, that is the point. Most Americans cannot find fulltime work with benefits, let alone a retirement account.
2953 2018-07-13 18:34:39 @Koalani QUERY: I teach fundamental investing skills to women. Classes are hands-on.

2954 2018-07-13 18:34:29 Ronaldo is the biggest icon in the world of Football, honeslty who else could move to a club and make their stocks increase, who else could move to a club and their followings hugely increase on social platforms. You can hate him but you would never reject him.
2955 2018-07-13 18:34:17 Talk about the big fat ugly stock market bubble, the fake economy, and fake jobs reports. I offer to debate you on the facts. Real GDP growth deeply negative 10 years running, properly accounting for inflation and deficit spending. Stocks 4-8X overpriced, small caps at high end.
2956 2018-07-13 18:33:41 Love the Key List, most of them have great fundamentals wich allow me to realy focus on the chart patterns and volume. Everything else is already in place! Number of stocks is good, but try to make the video around 15 min. Thanks!
2957 2018-07-13 18:33:32 Agree on the superior tech stocks. I’m in a few. But option prices are cheap here with implied volatility very low. Could pick up a few bucks on a swing trade. Watching.
2958 2018-07-13 18:33:26 I’ve got a few small cap stocks that I’m sitting on for the last couple of years. Oil, mining and agriculture tech. Not getting into too much on the side. So volatile right now across the board.

2961 2018-07-13 18:31:13 Trucking stocks will get hammered if we go into another recession like 2008. less people buying stuff means less companies shipping stuff. I am only investing in FOREX at the moment, avoiding US stocks like the plague. Dow (/YM) or S&P (/ES) e-mini futures might be a thing tho.
2962 2018-07-13 18:31:00 Waitrose pea pasta is great - cooks in 6 mins, holds its shape and actually tastes good! I mix simply with pesto & veg. Sometimes Waitrose stocks a fresh chickpea pasta in chiller section but is costly!

2968 2018-07-13 18:28:18 Thank you London! Now could you just quietly escort him to the stocks?
2969 2018-07-13 18:28:15 Also agree but that’s why it’s a continuous cycle some parents working so hard to keep a roof over there kids head n give them everything they need sometimes there’s no time to teach your child but I ain’t gone lie when I have a kid I’m starting him on stocks once he turns 10

2972 2018-07-13 18:27:30 Balanced funds’ straightforward mix of stocks and bonds can discourage investors from behaving in self-defeating ways, leading to strong returns.
2973 2018-07-13 18:27:28 Feel like news or events have little to do with it at this point. VIX smashing and money flow that keeps jamming most shorted stocks and big cap tech controls equities. Commodities have already begun deflating.
2974 2018-07-13 18:26:55 Things to remember from the loony left. When the stocks go down - f^#$ Trump. It's all his fault, he's destroying us. When they go up, it's "Thanks Obama"
2975 2018-07-13 18:26:21 Stocks down for this year. Consumer prices rose more in June than any month since 2012. Fuel going Over 3$ a gallon.  Factories laying off. So much winning.

2979 2018-07-13 18:24:48 Yes, but part of FASTGraphs carries estimates to 2019, while another part only goes to 2018. Inconsustent. And this happens with several other stocks. Chuck chose to highlight TCEHY with a video, so it was an appropriate question

2985 2018-07-13 18:22:13 I used #thinkorswim to find an undervalued stock, $KBR. Why so beaten down I asked? Well I found out why but I still love the fundamentals. #Stocks #money #investing
2986 2018-07-13 18:20:07 or people who think that if a stock is a 'good value' it will automatically go up, act surprised when it doesn't, and then get upset about AMZN NFLX type stocks, but refuse to buy them. isnt the goal to make the most money in the most efficient way possible??
2987 2018-07-13 18:19:47 I mean, part of what I want to do is (since I have several years experience trading stocks and an understanding of technical analysis) to extrapolate to the crypto community and XRP hodlers! Lots of ppl. haven't even been in the market for 1 year!
2988 2018-07-13 18:19:22 Its true,

2993 2018-07-13 18:16:40 Agree with the principle of banning UCIS but the arguement is that banning non-standard 'stuff' would see property and (I seem to think) deposit based assets too.

Surely banning any commission (or kickbacks) would be a part solution?

3052 2018-07-13 17:49:16 #79 is the bigggest broker on the TSX, runs multiple straegies, and has a arb machine with the US, so beside big crosses, he's usually the most active, espicially on dual listed stocks

3054 2018-07-13 17:48:14 So, in four games in Vegas, aside from averaging 22.5/5.0/2.2/1.5, Hart's putting up: 

-- 8.3 threes a game at a 42.4% clip
-- 16.4 AST% against a 6.52 TO%
-- 62.8 TS% on a 28.56 USG%
-- Even a stocks% above 4.0 for good measure.

Yeah, he's been pretty fucking dominant.
3055 2018-07-13 17:46:32 Can confirm, ran out of many stocks
3056 2018-07-13 17:46:30 This market environment has become dangerous imho. It's teaching newbies that chasing stocks over 50% gives good returns. These 100-300% moves don't last forever. Trade the charts, that lasts
3057 2018-07-13 17:45:19 this is actually a very good project tbh, idk why people didn't send me this , the boys have an emotional bond with BH , how great would it be if they offer them stocks!!! i'm sure they would be very proud since they helped built the empire!

3069 2018-07-13 17:39:03 Indeed.
3070 2018-07-13 17:38:58 I think they’ve used up all the stocks
3071 2018-07-13 17:38:27 The fact that forward earnings multiples are in line with their 25 year average is not encouraging.  That 25 years included two of the worst market crashes in US history. and a lost decade for stocks.  Should we expect more of the same?
3072 2018-07-13 17:36:58 I'm trying to figure out which stocks probably will not go down on a crash. If we have no crash, should be even better for those stocks right? Not ready yet.
3073 2018-07-13 17:36:47 2022.   The Hall Tax is a Tax on taxable investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains).  Put the money into tax exempt income for 4 years or stocks that do not pay a dividend.

3076 2018-07-13 17:33:55 Beware... strange things are happening around the stock market. CEOs of big companies are buying their own stocks like never before in history. Could either be a coup d‘etat or really the best outcome in American history.
3077 2018-07-13 17:33:21 @jimcramer I'm wondering what to do about AVGO? To sell now I'd take a 20% loss on my original trade. Many articles say there's no synergy with CA and a foolish acquisition. Don't want to lose even more money, but sometimes the market overreacts and stocks recover. Thoughts? Thx!
3078 2018-07-13 17:32:27 Crypto stresses me out it's way less predictable than stocks

3084 2018-07-13 17:29:06 Bonus doesn't make you rich. It's just an accounting entry. You will now have double the units at half the price. The idea is to increase trading in the stocks as the price is lower which would then enable you to be richer if the price goes up.

3098 2018-07-13 17:20:08 A reverse split would reduce the share account making the stock hotter tomorrow and harder to short sell.  Bears act like it’s a bad thing, but that’s because they don’t like it.. it makes the stock harder to manipulate!

3109 2018-07-13 17:13:01 You’re right. I don’t deal in stocks. My expertise is commercial real estate. The end goal with any investment is profit. Like I said, just because we’re not on the same field, don’t assume we’re not playing the game.
3110 2018-07-13 17:12:56 The whole case may ended in investigating the involved reporter and short-seller in orchestrating the false and inaccurate message to the public in order to lower the value of stocks.

3111 2018-07-13 17:12:51 I didnt mean it was risky selling LTC to DGB, thats kind of a no brainer. What I meant was risky is having all your eggs in one basket.

3168 2018-07-13 16:49:49 @thatginamiller I am sorry you were treated like this but I can no longer watch @bbcqt It is like a modern version of the braying mob around the public stocks No doubt the @BBC also approves of the alt right Tump keeping the Queen waiting and standing in front of her like a child

Q: Where is the evening event and when is it expected to start?
A: The location is called "Stocks" and is outside Phantasialand just across the street of the Berlin entrance. The event location will open their doors at 8 pm (evening).
3170 2018-07-13 16:47:06 All I do at work is literally look at stocks..
3171 2018-07-13 16:46:15 stocks or a investment house?
3172 2018-07-13 16:45:18 A stock is part ownership in a business.
When you buy stock, that business is working for you.
Over time, stocks VASTLY outperform cash.
3173 2018-07-13 16:45:12 That’s on you dawg but stocks pay off long term and that’s just where my minds at right now

3175 2018-07-13 16:44:54 And what has happened in terms of our polluting our planet? The destruction of wilderness and natural habitats? Of fish stocks? Human progress. (Progress towards what? I would ask.)

Key building/supplier stocks like $MAS, $SWK, $WHR, etc. look horrendous. Even $LB_F finally cooling. So, trend is getting noticed (in appropriate parts of the market)
3187 2018-07-13 16:38:18 Holding smaller/more value-oriented stocks in the US hasn’t helped a lot over last 10 years, but it hasn’t hurt either:

iShares Russell 3000 Index = +10.7%
DFA US Core 2 Equity = +11.0%
DFA US Small Value = +11.2%

3203 2018-07-13 16:29:01 Sir, we've all read the reports of corporations using their tax checks to buy stocks, give bonuses, etc.

I'm working two jobs to make rent.
3204 2018-07-13 16:28:46 You're only ready to invest in stocks if you're prepared to lose all of your money.
A company can do well for 9 years but die on the 10th.

3209 2018-07-13 16:26:56 Yep... The volume is less... Lack of buyers is pushing down stocks these days continuously... 
3210 2018-07-13 16:26:56 I think it's time to invest in liquor stocks because once Trump and the GOP are out of power, this country will see the biggest national party ever witnessed! Better stock up now before shelves are empty! 
3211 2018-07-13 16:26:55 I honestly don't care about any public official's current salary or net worth too much either. Regardless of party affiliation.

As long as it's legitimate and also not from say private prison stocks, big pharma, corporate donors, and other conflicts of interest.
3212 2018-07-13 16:26:54 NYSE A/D is my preferred breadth indicator, and when it made new highs in April it was certainly a factor in me taking entry signals in individual stocks while the indices were treading water, indicating the market was a lot healthier than the indices or headlines might suggest.
3213 2018-07-13 16:26:46 Yeah Ness advantage stage is not intimidating like Lucas Peach Luigi....but the damage output is there to take out stocks
3214 2018-07-13 16:26:04 LIC and other government institutions have been told to heavily buy index stocks. Many are selling small and big caps, so that they can follow instructions.
3215 2018-07-13 16:25:57 MFs buy and sell stocks in their funds every day. Can only know the types of stocks they would buy. Once you read what is filed with the SEC the data is already old, so even if I had time to monitor such funds, &I don't, would make no sense. I rep defrauded investors for decades.

3289 2018-07-13 15:52:17 $BIDU at least today, it putting reins on all Chinese stocks.  It had a good move and suffering from profit taking blues.
3290 2018-07-13 15:51:00 In the short term America wins, long term China wins, China is about to lose by epic proportions in this trade war but will be able to bounce back strong. I’m looking for many Chinese stocks to go down +10%, looking to get in on $JD lows! $BABA in danger
3291 2018-07-13 15:50:39 Which ones? The Fanboy frauds who say stocks mean nothing (they determine net worth of a company) only when it's dropping for their favorite company but then praise to no end how amazing it is when it rises? Or the ones that over exaggerate bad news to make it seem not so bad? 
3292 2018-07-13 15:48:32 saying like that J.C.  and it cd seem that the majority of the 100 stocks are making new highs and not much more than just 4 or 5 stocks (FANG). ;)
3293 2018-07-13 15:48:22 Sir you mean Index to fall or underperforming stocks to perform ?

3297 2018-07-13 15:46:24 If stocks and bonds crashed housing would become affordable so maybe that's the plan.
3298 2018-07-13 15:46:18 Just like you side with the special interests on healthcare and the environment. Divest your stocks and stop taking money from international mining companies, and then maybe you will have the moral high ground to speak up.
3299 2018-07-13 15:45:50 Imagine if Donald Trump was manager of Everton, he would lock Danny Murphy up in Quantanamo Bay, put Mick Quinn in stocks in Williamson Square, Aldo, Mark Lawrenson, Ian Beale & DJ Spoony in Walton nick.

Be boss that 
3300 2018-07-13 15:45:12 Gut feeling Says that these index management stocks are going to get bust in days to come. Q1 results might become trigger, some of them have gone way beyond valuation and market usually bottoms out once such hiding places goes bust.
3301 2018-07-13 15:45:09 What about stocks ??
3302 2018-07-13 15:44:18 Today Pakistan needs the followings:
1. Electricity
2. Dams
3. Food and energy stocks
4. Roads' web
5. Trees plantation on after every 20 sqf.
6. Reforms in HEALTH & EDUCATION.
7. Reforms in small, medium & heavy industry.
8. Recycling plants of waste material.
3303 2018-07-13 15:44:14 "Saunders said U.S. Homeland Security’s definition of “business” in the country can be quite broad and can include mutual funds or any other investment plans."

basically every index will eventually hold related stocks, so every retirement plan would be "guilty"

3305 2018-07-13 15:43:07 been a very good one month run so may sit back unless something looks good.  Really liking getting long RB/WTI.  Think Ti/brent widens which has a correlation to widening out RB/TI and also think  RB stocks will get tight this winter.  So like both those spreads combined.
3306 2018-07-13 15:42:50 Turnover on the JSE has averaged a rather pathetic R15.1bn over the 10 trading days of July. Simply no interest in our stocks. Time to start sniffing around for value may be close.
3307 2018-07-13 15:42:29 And yet they can’t think second level enough to realize stocks are flattening, with the curve, because growth peaked and is beginning a descent
3308 2018-07-13 15:41:45 Obama took our GI BILL away so the stocks would fall and this friend could them cheap ( the colleges)
Meanwhile people that needed GI MONEY couldnt get them. After his friend bought the stocks cheap then Obama shit head put the GI MONEY IN PLAY AGAIN.
IN YOUR EYES THIS IS RIGHT.
3309 2018-07-13 15:41:41 The problem with setting price targets is that the best stocks usually end up going a lot further than anyone expects.

3311 2018-07-13 15:39:06 For profit is simply classification & includes stock & nonstock listed businesses in business to earn profit while providing goods or services.

Naming is deceptive, most business degree holders know intricate details. Stocks make profit as return on investment & reward for risk

3349 2018-07-13 15:22:26 With stocks it might be a good idea to not sell on market open - especially on a day like today. With crypto that really isn't too much of worry since the market is open 24/7 and any sort of movements aren't delayed - they happen instantly.

3370 2018-07-13 15:15:22 Stocks gain traction, allowing S&P to retest 2,800.

Pres Trump's visit to the UK drew to a close, but not without interjecting his opinion into the Brexit debate. USTreasury curve moving towards 25 basis points.
3371 2018-07-13 15:15:21 Stocks can trade at very high pe multiples on a sustained basis only if there is consistent high growth in top and bottom lines. Majority of small and midcaps have inconsistent performances so high pe multiples not justified.

3374 2018-07-13 15:14:46 Curious to see what WTI does when Cushing stocks approach 20-21 MMbl. What I think is minimum working inventory for Cushing. SUspect XOM, VLO, PSX, MPC/ANDV will shut refineries to ensure WTI does not go too high as it'll affect pricing on the larger operations.
3375 2018-07-13 15:14:44 there are fewer publicly traded companies so more dollars flowing into fewer stocks. Pension funds are more vested than ever before.

3801 2018-07-13 12:19:51 Well, my memories of their influence has to do with who tells the railroad where to send the grain cars. And I understand that Berkshire Hathaway owns a big interest in rail stocks now. And a lot of those small farmers voted for trump didn;t they?

3808 2018-07-13 12:17:43 A huge mistake I see short-sellers making is trying to scalp hard to borrow stocks. The hard to borrow fee will eat away your profits on such small wins, which is why I maximize my positions and make 20%-50%+ returns

3810 2018-07-13 12:16:48 Agree 100%. Drawing down stocks is a time-buying strategy, not a solution. Plus, drawing down stocks to get to Brazilian new crop is putting a lot of eggs in the Brazillian-120MMT camp which is no guarantee either.

3816 2018-07-13 12:13:36 So the question is - what happens after that? 

Do they buy more in 19/20 to rebuild stocks? Do they draw on stocks again next year as US acreage declines? 

Just seems like drawing stocks is just trying to buy time?
3817 2018-07-13 12:12:30 Still don't believe they can do without US soybeans, but drawing down stocks by 5-8MMT can buy them a lot of breathing room to get to January.

3819 2018-07-13 12:11:31 Fleshed out some ideas on the Chinese soy situation this morning in the comments. Chinese soy imports projected down y/y for the first time since 03/04. Usage still up 5.1%. If they draw down stocks by 6-7MMT both can easily happen and they've got the stocks to do it.
3820 2018-07-13 12:11:19 Why has the Indian market become so narrow?

We're increasing food stocks to 30 days worth, because we can, and if 'No Deal' looks more likely by December we'll make it 60 days.

 Evens out flows, so hopefully less shortages

4047 2018-07-13 09:15:14 #Asianstocks continued their recovery on Friday, as investors shifted their focus on positive expectations for #WallStreet gains, while the yen's decline supported Japanese stocks, although Sino-US #tradetensions dampened gains

4057 2018-07-13 09:09:17 "Brave" way to protest as soon as Trump has finally left London. Like making rude gestures behind someone's back. Laughing stocks who do not represent the majority of British people in any way at all.

4065 2018-07-13 09:04:06 Asset inflation is already here, just not in the form of CPI. I think bitcoin price shows that perfectly aside from property, & stocks.

The last commodity bull cycle probably peaked in 2011 with gold, silver, copper and 2014 with oil. It will be back within 10 years.

4082 2018-07-13 08:49:53 Time Sykes was just motivation for me. I’m not into shorting penny stocks. But his YouTube videos did make me want to quit my day job and become a trader. So I gotta give him credit
4083 2018-07-13 08:49:19 No, I’m more optimistic on the persistence of the equity premium versus the small/value/quality/international tilts. Simpler: I believe it’s more likely stocks will beat bonds over a given period than that value will beat growth. Do you agree?

4132 2018-07-13 07:55:27 based on past experiences, just a few stocks moving up is a sign of trouble. 
Red Flag
But history may not repeat. 
don't think there is a need to panic. just keep holding and adding quality stocks. 
Quality stocks = 10y+ execution track record, no debt, high ROCE, decent growth

4154 2018-07-13 07:33:07 Odd "supply" issue on the margin, as capital flight flows move into US$ and stocks. Demand spikes (and times) appear to be when liquidity is low (post-euro close, AHs), hence outsized moves to upside. Hypothesis for now, any ideas on data+analysis (esp. who's buying) appreciated!
4155 2018-07-13 07:33:04 Minus a few errant remarks here and there, this is largely accurate. This brings us back around to the main point of this interaction: as you said, AKs and military ordnance didn't fall from the sky, but rather came directly from Syrian government stocks.
4156 2018-07-13 07:32:49 Index does not show true representation of how the economy is doing or market is doing as against vastly held belief. It just show how top 5-10 stocks are doing in general. Such selective representation will have serious repercussion in future for equity flow.

4162 2018-07-13 07:30:14 That isn't a bad approach.  The trouble is some high quality stocks may never become cheap.  So it is possible to miss out by waiting. It is also the lower quality companies that tend to have issues.  But if you wait long enough a high quality company will offer an opportunity.

4170 2018-07-13 07:20:49 6) Then u have awareness & people who might want to trade alts via their TD Ameritade account after work. Can’t trade stocks, but Crypto is always open. Now security tokens heat up because companies will want global nonstop trading of their assets.
4171 2018-07-13 07:19:21 As soon as u start seeing MoneyControl articles like- "These 3 stocks can give 10-40% return in 6 months" become very cautious.  Especially in this market where 5-6 stocks are holding the fort. 

If anyone of these stocks forecasts muted earning, can trigger a downward spiral.

4175 2018-07-13 07:17:27 Asian shares extended their recovery on Friday, as investors shifted their focus to bullish expectations for Wall Street earnings and as a weaker yen supported Japanese stocks, though Sino-U.S. trade tensions have tempered exuberance.

4177 2018-07-13 07:14:21 Yes agree if you are just looking at the total stocks but the issue is access. China account for 52% of global wheat stocks up from 35% 10 years ago and 70% of the increase in mt. Stocks in major export zones at 10 year lows and if you exclude the US they are mega tight.

4179 2018-07-13 07:14:02 I am not sure why market is so scared of short sellers. When short sellers are wrong, stocks fly. Have a look at most shorted US stocks, most fly. It's the best thing that can happen to a quality stock , clicks perfect example. Its always one of the most shorted, always up.

4401 2018-07-13 04:18:22 There is a positive movement in the market but couldn't sense strength in most of the front line stocks..!! Trade cautiously on #Nifty! Watch out for a crash below 10990 spot levels!
4402 2018-07-13 04:17:56 This is a business news emergency broadcast. The Politics Advocates are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  K stocks. Thank you for tuning into  Fox.

4407 2018-07-13 04:15:29 What he means is when there is low volume/lull hours it is more dangerous to trade and there is no edge here since spreads are bigger and stocks are easily manipulated during these times.

4410 2018-07-13 04:13:21 Is the narrow leadership in the market that much of a worry? 7 out of the top 10 stocks by market capitalization are at life-time highs. That's much different then the market being led by a few speculative names with hazy balance sheets.
4411 2018-07-13 04:13:11 U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday admitted ethical lapses in reporting on his financial assets & said he would sell all of his remaining stocks after receiving a critical letter from the federal ethics agency. How many of Trump's nominees w/ ethical issues is this?

4425 2018-07-13 03:59:32 To be fair, it was just a bad tweet. You dont need to max your 401k every year, or ANY year, nor do you need to be in 100% stocks to reach $1mil in a standard working career (30-40 years). The backlash was funny, but easy to see why it happened.
4426 2018-07-13 03:58:55 Your generation...you want everything free. Free healthcare, free education, free money...You don't know the value of a dollar or what it is to earn it. You look at us and see what we have and you're jealous. You want it. Difference is, I fought for my slice of pie.
4427 2018-07-13 03:57:24 Earned a Series 7 license. Nothing was handed to me. Every dime I have, I earned. And I started 3.85 and at one point, I was homeless. Didn't stop me. Many people like you are disadvantaged. They pick themselves off the ground and had the courage to soldier on.

4431 2018-07-13 03:53:55 I work 2 jobs (1 FT/1PT). I'm almost debt free. I built two houses in the last 3 years. I don't have cable tv. Netflix, Hulu. I don't eat out daily or weekly. I have one weekend for the fam. I got a fully paid SUV and nearly paid Corolla. Both in excellent condition..

4434 2018-07-13 03:50:21 you are going to be hurting for a very long time...Degrees worth getting? Business, Medical, Nursing, STEM, that is what gets people money. Psych? My niece graduated with that degree 3 years ago. Still can't find a job. She's working at a car dealership.
4435 2018-07-13 03:48:57 One..I don't pay 9.99 for Youtube...no reason to. Secondly, you want a 1000 for ...(ahem)..community college? No problem. If you are adverse to taking out student loans (don't blame you), join the military. Also..I don't know your career choice..but if it's puppetry..
4436 2018-07-13 03:48:39 You're missing the point.  Regular working people don't have the money to throw away on stocks in the quantity required to gain control of a company.

4447 2018-07-13 03:41:41 It didn't last long in 2015, and it wasn't even enough to send the SPX higher--it merely sent momentum stocks higher (including small-cap growth)--just like now. It was a 5-6 month phenomenon.
4448 2018-07-13 03:41:34 I'm guessing you never took poli sci either...You can't equate wage with Constitutional Rights. Your wages have zip to with any of the amendments or the framework of government.

Can you generate roughly 75$/hr in rev x8hr

4451 2018-07-13 03:39:59 This is keeping stocks from falling now...for now.
4452 2018-07-13 03:39:40 Yes, and I must say, the past few months feels a great deal like H1 2015 in so many ways. Momentum stocks going parabolic, "value" out-of-favor, small-caps soaring while SPX stagnates, etc. We know it didn't last long and ended with an unwind that could have gotten much worse.

4461 2018-07-13 03:36:42 Releasing at Case Study Atelier. July 14, 2018. 
Limited stocks only. So be fucking early.
4462 2018-07-13 03:36:13 It doesn't matter how hard you work at a goal, if the opportunity isn't there, all that will go to waste. If you don't have $9.99 every month, you can't pay for YouTube Premium. If you don't have $1,032 every semester, you can't pay for Community College. Common Sense 101.
4463 2018-07-13 03:36:07 I told you my site operates on a 38% labor cost value. We have to factor in the hourly, the salaried, the statics and non-static variables and come with a daily % of how much we have to earn to pay everyone for that day plus our bills. Our revenue for the day...

4465 2018-07-13 03:35:43 So the difference in this cycle is that the US is the target of the global yield-seeking carry trades (plus flight capital from China). That means US stocks fall the hardest, just like EM fell hardest in 2008. Those pension funds will regret their yield / performance chasing.

4468 2018-07-13 03:34:13 Skate on minimal effort? Do you realize just how hard disadvantaged people work just to survive? Some work 2 or 3 full-time jobs. Are you seriously going to call that "minimal effort"?

No person working a full-time job should be paid less than necessary to survive.
4469 2018-07-13 03:34:05 So the whole concept of make your opportunity is lost on you? Too proud to get your hands dirty? Your life, your responsibility. We gave you the tools in the form of K to 12 education. Hell you got Pell grants, Staffords Sub and Unsub loans. Make use of it. Stop whining.

4473 2018-07-13 03:33:49 Hasn't Japan been doing carry-trades like these for decades? I seem to remember that in the last cycle, they bid up EM stocks to the moon, and then of course when they collapsed, you had the Yen soaring as a safe-haven currency. Or is my memory fuzzy?

Eee lad .. I'm my England, he would be stripped of office, dragged through the streets for the people to see and abuse him. Locked in the stocks for a week for all to throw their nappies and rotten veggies at him.  Even that would be too good for him.
4476 2018-07-13 03:32:39 Re stocks - easy up easy down
4477 2018-07-13 03:32:12 I know I can't possibly move up the ladder if I don't have the opportunity to do so. I know any service I can provide is worth being paid at least enough to survive on my own.
4478 2018-07-13 03:32:09 I am celebrating 20th anniversary of my nail-cutter. A $2 Revlon bought in 1998 in US still goes strong flawlessly. Thats performance and longevity. Wish some of my stocks were as good
4479 2018-07-13 03:31:48 My thought is when u buy options u have to be right in direction n stock should move in that direction in given time. When selling u collect premium n u make money if stocks do not move or moves in ur direction. Time decay is on ur side.
4480 2018-07-13 03:31:38 Yes he did. We also didn't have globalism in 1932. Guess you missed that too. You can't cherry pick your way through trying to whine for more while doing less.  So the big question of course is: How much more should consumers pay so you can skate on minimal effort?

4482 2018-07-13 03:30:32 Well, George Washington is dead and the Constitution was from a VERY different time period. Should we throw out our founding document on that basis alone?

4488 2018-07-13 03:28:37 Y'know, for a party that screams about morality, you're talking a lot about how someone who's stuck at a minimum wage job because there are no opportunities available to them should go commit suicide. Are you Christian? Pretty sure you're Christian. Pretty anti-Christian of you.
4489 2018-07-13 03:28:25 It's true that stocks went up again after the truncated 2016 bottom, but they continually increased global QE (plus China fiscal stimulus) after that point. With global QE coming down, US stocks will come down too, only question is how far down before they re-start QE.
4490 2018-07-13 03:28:11 I forgot, I’m old, I did not realize I own these stocks.  Next question.

4493 2018-07-13 03:26:57 The idea that the minimum wage was always supposed to be for kids is objectively WRONG. All you have to do is ask FDR. He even said a business who can't pay a living wage has no right running in the US.

Don't forget he's the one that got us out of the Great Depression.
4494 2018-07-13 03:26:54 Well...one..FDR is dead. Two, again..different time period. Like I said, any adult working more than 6 months in Min Wage without a raise means: Note, rope, bridge, and an Olympic score 9.5/9.3/9.8/.94 for a header into the water.

4498 2018-07-13 03:26:29 Surely they didn’t make him give up his stocks in Conestoga Wagons
4499 2018-07-13 03:26:20 If you take a broader look at the past several years, it's really been a strong USD era with US stocks dramatically outperforming foreign ones & value-agnostic indexing dominant. Much like the 2nd half of the 1990s. That ended too--multiples don't grow to the sky.
4500 2018-07-13 03:24:28 You want 15? Be prepared to be very unemployed and collecting welfare. The robots are coming. You want too much and your labor production is minimal at best v. product goals. My advice? Learn robotics or programming if you can't handle finance and management.
4501 2018-07-13 03:24:25 Which is why the minimum wage was supposed to be chained to inflation: The value of the items for sale would stay the same and the value of what you earn would also stay the same. Inflation happens with or without chaining the minimum wage to it.
4502 2018-07-13 03:23:07 Investment view:  Ipca lab seems fantastic above 765  it would inch up to @832/887/950/1185 in coming months ..I already shared views on this stocks at very low levels @400-420 educational purpose only
4503 2018-07-13 03:22:24 Then tell that to Franklin D. Roosevelt, the guy who implemented it in the first place and said himself you're supposed to be able to live a COMFORTABLE life off it. He did NOT say it's for kids. If the minimum wage is for kids, WHY DOES IT APPLY TO ADULTS?

4508 2018-07-13 03:19:17 I guess what I'm wondering is what would stop the Jap pension funds from bidding US stocks thru the moon and beyond. Probably just the same thing that ends every bull market--an econ downturn, deleveraging, feed-back loops, etc. turn everyone cautious/fearful & reset valuations.

4510 2018-07-13 03:19:00 non-static variables is the incurred operating expense such as power, water, sewage, security, etc... You can't jack up Min Wage and ignore every other aspect of the business at hand. You're dead in the water if you do.
4511 2018-07-13 03:18:53 @midcap_mantra Brother,want to invest 2 lakhs in 1-2 company for 20yrs also would like to add in SIP’s. Can ICICI/ITC be good stocks to add?
4512 2018-07-13 03:18:43 I moved a bunch of my 401k out of stocks and into cash and bonds on the advice of my financial planner. Stock market was up 30% last year, 3% this year and dropping. I’m cutting and running 
4513 2018-07-13 03:18:14 Has anyone thought of investigating if Trump's pals have stocks in companies that are providing the DNA testing of refugees??  Trump says refugees will pay but we are still waiting for Mexico to pay for the wall.  Someone is paying the companies who stand to make big bucks!
4514 2018-07-13 03:17:53 Read between the lines... More stocks nearer to their lows
4515 2018-07-13 03:17:51 Add even more that employers pay 1/2 the SS and 1/2 the medicare tax as well which increases their labor cost. My ops group out here runs a 38% labor cost margin. We have to account for static variables like building lease, forklift leases, and maintenance
4516 2018-07-13 03:17:24 That's how stocks work!!! When good news come stock bounces back up.
4517 2018-07-13 03:17:03 Ross knows something about tariffs, have to check type of stocks.
4518 2018-07-13 03:16:55 I wouldn't necessarily classify intl stocks as just a short USD bet. I think it's important to diversify currency exposure. I'm not expecting any long-term risk premium from non-USD holdings, just trying to smooth the ride a bit. Mid-2000s a good example
4519 2018-07-13 03:16:46 Because it's not the rich person's money. It's the company's money. Huge difference. Profit margins take into account EBIDTA under GAAP rules. Most groceries and fast food chains have a 2% margin give or take. Labor costs is the highest cost.
4520 2018-07-13 03:16:01 Historically, when foreigners start rushing into a country's stocks/assets, is that not a sign of a top? Foreigners tend to have lousy market timing (worse than locals) if memory serves, though I don't have data on hand.
4521 2018-07-13 03:15:12 You work with what you have. You want 3 hots and a cot? Join the military. I did. Worked out just fine. I would love nothing more than to have you operate a fast food business and make payroll and pay your vendors with 15/hr. You would be filing BK in 2 quarters.
4522 2018-07-13 03:15:05 We’re finally going to buy our first stocks. I really want to get in on Amazon 
4523 2018-07-13 03:13:52 It was for KIDS! I made 3.85 in 1986, oh entitled one. I didn't have an apartment. I rented a one tiny room while I went to college. I didn't have a car. I had a moped. Get it yet? I didn't knock up my girlfriend and ruin her life either by dooming her to poverty.
4524 2018-07-13 03:13:49 I can see it with SNB because they really care more about just keeping the SNB stable. But pension funds have JPY nominal return requirements. That's all the more reason to buy JPY stocks, even if they fear JPY collapse--pension obligations nominal are they not?

4528 2018-07-13 03:12:31 to make a low skill worker on par with a trade tech worker starting out. You cheapen the effort of everyone who did everything to strive for more. Neil Boortz said it best: A man is worth 2 dollars below the neck. You want more? Prove your worth.
4529 2018-07-13 03:12:25 Yeah, I'm done listening to Fox News talking points. If you can't understand the fact that someone without the resources to survive on their own can't possibly spend some time learning a decent skill, you're hopeless.
4530 2018-07-13 03:11:13 All of sudden this fallen stocks want to show they have something to show. First manpasand tieup with parle and now this. If they would have focused all along.

Stay away from this stocks.
4531 2018-07-13 03:10:51 skill set value compressed to a low skill worker who can barely handle bun/meat/bun? In California, forklift drivers have to go a state approved trade school just to certify and get, hopefully, 16/hr. The only thing you accomplish is flattening the pay grades..

Christopher Wood , CLSA says trade issue can come back & hit stock markets any time. Expect Tariff war escalation to impact auto industry. China-A share offer decent value after correction. FOMC statement important to see.
4533 2018-07-13 03:10:32 Pres Trump agrees to "assist some NATO nations" to buy arms from the US, also those that can't really afford the stocks value! It's always amusing how nations are cloned into "economic loyalists", without their, perhaps, direct awareness. Business president doing illegit...legit!
4534 2018-07-13 03:10:00 Everything you are saying right now misses the whole entire point of the Minimum Wage. Yes, you are supposed to be able to survive off the minimum wage. What is it's point if not that?
4535 2018-07-13 03:09:31 What happens to the cost of sourced ingredients and products? Goes up. In order for any of us to compensate we have to raise prices or....lay off workers. My tech team here is a 5 man team. The lowest person makes 26.50/hr. What makes you think my jr. admin wants his..
4536 2018-07-13 03:09:15 go disappoint the next hoe i’m busy
4537 2018-07-13 03:08:19 Definitely not the July to be out of stocks Marla. The trend is for a new high in the S&P perhaps as early as next week. These knee-jerk drops like Wednesday remain opportunities to set up more trades in my opinion. Take care.
4538 2018-07-13 03:08:15 Supply Chain. Every product you buy has components that has to be sourced. Your buns, your meat, you soda cups, veggies and those condiments..all of it sourced. Source to creation, to warehouse, to distribution. All of those folks are looking at 15/hr as well. So..

4543 2018-07-13 03:04:55 Newsflash: It never was meant to live on. As evidenced...repeatedly. You are so focused on minimum wage with an absolute disregard to businesses. We operate on product v. labor cost. When it comes to reporting, Finance only cares about two things: Profit and Profit margin. --

4557 2018-07-13 02:55:55 Why do I think "divests from all stocks" means in 6 months he will be admitting he still owns some stocks.
4558 2018-07-13 02:55:53 Has to be a manipulated market. And since alternatives like stocks and property garner much of the attention, the much more under owned metals markets avoid investor attention.

4589 2018-07-13 02:43:22 European stocks rose on Thursday as investors consolidated steep losses from the previous session when heightened fears of an escalation to the US-China trade war soured sentiment.

4608 2018-07-13 02:31:49 Interesting and telling that you automatically blame workers. No reason to continue discussing unless you can prove with facts that wages increase with profits. Hint, you can't.
4609 2018-07-13 02:31:44 You really think that someone who doesn't take an opportunity that they can not have should go out and commit suicide? Because they don't have the opportunity to be successful?

You can't exactly take a higher wage job if there isn't an opportunity to get one, y'know.

4612 2018-07-13 02:30:12 Stocks are shares of a particular company that that company sells to the public.
4613 2018-07-13 02:29:42 That said, trading still provides a benefit to society. People need to buy or sell their stocks to, for instance, invest or cash out of their 401k. Stock traders provide the liquidity for that, so that those who need to buy or sell don't have to wait. They buy/sell time.

4633 2018-07-13 02:25:32 I feel terrible for him. He won't be able to short sell stocks with all that foreknowledge of his. Torture.
4634 2018-07-13 02:25:22 the persistent bid for treasuries is very impressive. who is right stocks or bonds?
4635 2018-07-13 02:25:16 I don't look at like I'm betting on a companies failure. More like, I'm hedging against investors who overinflated the value of a stock for their own personal gain. W/O shorting, stocks would be even more corrupt and out of control. All about checks and balances!
4636 2018-07-13 02:25:15 Then let me ask you this: WHY would anyone get any sort of job if the only opportunities available to them are paying wages they can't survive off of? You can't exactly get more skilled if you can't take the time to learn more skills, or go to school to learn them.
4637 2018-07-13 02:23:09 HCL Tech is one of our preferred stocks in the sector, says Credit Suisse
4638 2018-07-13 02:22:58 80% pay less taxes.
others benefit from new jobs, bonuses and wage increases.
still others, who own stocks in their retirement account, benefit from the market's reaction to tax cuts.

throw that all together and i bet 90% PLUS have benefited.
wish it was 100% and you too.
4639 2018-07-13 02:22:05 Home? How many homes?!
4640 2018-07-13 02:22:02 their actual skill or lack of, while keeping the exact same level of work at an even keel. So paying them double to do the same amount of work they did originally and they weren't that great at it to start with. Send in the robots. Less drama and pain.
4641 2018-07-13 02:20:46 Same as when Lockheed Martin stocks dropped when North and South Korea shook hands. Investors are twisted.
4642 2018-07-13 02:20:13 Min Wage wasn't about survival and it hasn't been for a while. Maybe in the 50's and 60's, sure. But come 80's and 90's it was for kids. Not for grown adults. So where you fail, spectacularly, is the part where you think no skill/low skill deserve to be paid higher than --
4643 2018-07-13 02:17:17 How about families of children murdered by illegals who don't recognize what's left of their of sons and/or daughters thus forced to have a closed casket funeral? Maybe instead of catering to illegals, you should focus more on our citizens.
4644 2018-07-13 02:14:41 And..if you paid attention to Bezos over the last month or so, he is very willing to help you start your own little business with Amazon. Got 30k in the bank and willing to put some hours in to develop your Amazon partnership? That's the problem. Low skill workers have no drive.
4645 2018-07-13 02:13:16 So what does that tell you? Does it tell you the low skill/no worker is on the verge of being obsolete? Does it also tell you that perhaps it's time for those workers to skill up and move into a trade or better education?
4646 2018-07-13 02:13:12 Did he already "earn" the stocks (i.e. was it part of signing bonus, annual bonus, or the like), or were they entirely handed out as part of the retirement agreement. ?
4647 2018-07-13 02:13:10 $AAOI - on reversal watch! Looking for a break above $50.25. Highly shorted and if triggered the squeeze should send it . Low float

Give me your thoughts - price targets and best guess as to where this play will go next.

    Stocks rallied as trade tensions appeared to ease after China held off from immediately retaliating against the latest U.S. salvo.
    Technology shares led gains, sending the Nasdaq Composite Index to a record.
4662 2018-07-13 02:04:44 Companies exist for a few reasons, only one of which is making money. Others include providing a service, obscuring the ownership of other companies, and one of the most important is to stay in business, and grow. Companies that don't look after staff will struggle with the last.
4663 2018-07-13 02:04:12 If the SEC weren't going to approve a #Bitcoin etf then why would they preempt their decision making with a major overhaul to how they approve ETFs? The ETF market already flooded, more ETFs exist then underlying stocks . Only thing they need to change rules for is Bitcoin.

4675 2018-07-13 01:54:04 Inflation at 5 months high; IIP is at 7 months low while SENSEX reaches lifetime high! However total marketcap is lower than its own peak as very few stocks account for the record. And many stocks are at their lowest. Be cautious to link Stock Market to economic performance
4676 2018-07-13 01:53:30 "Is it the role of government to determine how much wealth one should have?"

No, but this is *not an argument*. It's a straw-man. The purpose of things like the minimum wage is to create an equality of *opportunity*, not an equality of outcome.

4750 2018-07-13 00:53:46 Oops I missed this question earlier.  I'd love to see us revisit red flag laws and address bump stocks.  Most of the gun owners I've talked to in our district agree that these steps are just common sense.  #119townhall
4751 2018-07-13 00:53:35 @ReformedBroker A CPA gave a colleague of mine an investment book to read on proper allocations. This “advisor” suggests an allocation of 1/3 stocks/bonds/funds, 1/3 Alternatives (REITS, coins, metals), and 1/3 Fixed Index Annuities. I laughed
4752 2018-07-13 00:53:29 Buying increased prices, selling decreases prices. Does it matter if index fund buys a basket of stocks or an fund manager buys stock in an individual company?
4753 2018-07-13 00:52:45 Seriously give props to all the trend traders who can sit on the computer all day holding stocks like $IZEA long or short for hours to maximize profit. I am mentally spent after 1hr on the screens lol... That is why i love @mafiadaytrading style of nail and bail!

4775 2018-07-13 00:36:14 I literally just use paper. I gave myself a mental $5000 then watch the stocks. I mentally say okay here is my entry, here is my strategy, here is my exit plan incase it goes south, and here is my goal. Then in real time I watch what the stock does and see how much I would make.

Stocks rise and fall for all sorts of reasons and this is a blip. The true extent of CEO exit package more news- worthy.
